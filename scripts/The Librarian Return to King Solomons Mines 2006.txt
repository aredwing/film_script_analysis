Thought to be the most powerful precognitive medium in the known universe. It can show you the future and be incredibly deadly in the wrong hands. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going? I'm going to go down there. Get that skull. But there's at least six of them and there's only two of us. And they got guns. Relax. This kind of stuff happens to me all the time. Let's seal this place off. Get the hell out of here. Put the dynamite down there. You. In the corner. Set it down. Let's go. Come on. Let's get out of here, boys. Let's go. You. Enough. In the corner. That's it. Block off the path. All right, we got it. Now can we go? Yep. Flynn. I don't believe it. Let's move. Do you know what this is? It's an authentic Sioux arrowhead. This means that the Sioux migrated further west than previously thought. That's great. I got five of those back home. Now can we get out of here? Just gonna see if I can pry it loose. Set the charge so we can blow this place up. Come on down. Hi. We were-- We were just... Arrowhead. They've got the skull. Kill them. Run, Yellow Hawk. Come on! Does this kind of stuff happen to you all the time, too? You get used to it. Easy. Easy. Easy. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. After them. Get the skull. I think we lost them. Go! Whoa! These rocks. Don't let them get away. There's no way out. We have to turn around. That's a tamarisk shrub. Wherever there's a tamarisk, there's got to be... What month is it? It's March, right? What? Okay. When I say jump, we jump. Jump? Are you out of your mind? Let's go. Ready? How did you know? Tamarisk shrub. It only grows near rivers. And Utah's average water level for March is 5 feet, three-quarter inches. So I figured that would be enough to break our fall. But it's April. April? Really? Huh? We should have been smashed like pancakes. I guess we got really lucky... April? Boy. Boy. Come here. Come here. I want you to take this to the post office for me. Do you understand? Hurry. Hurry. It's very important. Now, go. Hurry. Here. Here. Yeah. Now go. Go. Hurry, hurry, hurry. The secret shall be passed. Whatever you've done with it, I will find it. Flynn, you're 1.2 minutes late. I'll be sure to deduct that from your pay. Judson is looking for you downstairs. Oh, I hope you remembered to save your receipts this time. What, did we acquire a new statue? No, Steve, the guard, accidentally looked at Medusa's head. Turned to stone. Who covers that? Is that health insurance or Workman's Comp? This is a place of business, not your home. I would appreciate it if you did not have your personal correspondence sent here. Don't you have an apartment? I have an apartment. I'm never there. I'm always working. Well, your landlord called, and you're late on your rent. Your mother wants you to stop by after work. Oh. And this came for you. Egypt? Well, now that I'm done playing secretary, I have work to do. And so do you. Good morning. Lou. I was sorry to hear about Steve. Hello? Hello? Judson? I'm home. Excalibur. Not now, okay? I'm not in the mood. Can you not see that I'm just a little bit preoccupied? Okay. You want to play? I'll play with you. Here we go. Ah! Now I've got you. You're all washed up. That's enough for today. It's best not to use water analogies with Poseidon's trident. Judson, I know you've instructed Excalibur to attack me at will, but this is a little ridiculous. It's all part of the plan. I'm just coming off a mission. It's part of your training. I haven't even had a cup of coffee. And I've been wearing the same clothes for the last four days, and I'm wet again. Keeps you sharp. Besides, you almost had him that time. Uh, you're using the Shroud of Turin. Leo? Leo, I thought I told you to put the Shroud away. Sorry, Judson. Follow me, Flynn. Come on. There's something I want to show you. Oh, wow. I don't believe it. This is a completely different part of the library. I'm honored that you'd show it to me. This is the service entrance. So, how did, uh, how did Utah go? One Crystal Skull, as promised. Well, I think the library's going to be a much safer home. Looks like I saved the world. Again. Barely. Barely? What's that supposed to mean? I heard about the incident at the burial cave. You risked your life and almost... And almost lost the skull. All because of some artifact. Oh, that was no ordinary artifact. That was an authentic Sioux arrowhead. In Utah, of all places. And--and where is the arrowhead now? Um, well, I lost it, jumping off a cliff into the Colorado River. But you should have seen it. It was... Yeah, your little escapade could have jeopardized the--the--the whole mission. Okay, you know, Judson, I've been a librarian here for over a year now. And in that time, I have saved the world from--from magic spears and time-traveling ninjas and--and--and everything else that you can think of. I think I'm doing a pretty good job. You have. Well, then when are you going to... When are you... Can you stop playing for one second, please? When are you going to start to trust me? Flynn, I--I--I trust you. I mean, we--we send you out on missions alone. It's just... You have a lot to learn. I mean, sometimes you have to give up what you want for--for the greater good. See, that's the difference between a good librarian and--and a great librarian. Are you all right? I mean, is something else bothering you? No. I've-- I've got work to do. Hello? Mom? I got a message that you wanted me to stop by. Surprise! Surprise! Oh, my God. I've died and gone to hell. Oh. 32 years old. I don't believe it. My baby boy is all grown up. Mom, you know I hate these things. What things? Birthdays? Nonsense. Who doesn't like birthdays? Who are these people? Oh, friends, relatives. The girls from my mahjong club. What? You keep your life so secret, I don't know who to invite. Oh, there's someone I want you to meet. No, Mom. I don't want... No more matchmaking. I know. I know. But this one's perfect. Perfect. Rose? Rose? Rose, Flynn. Flynn, Rose. I'm getting goosebumps just looking at the two of you. Hello, Flynn. Happy birthday. Thank you. You're Rose Edwards. Yes. Isn't she charming? Would you excuse us for one second? Sure. What's wrong? Too skinny? She's my third cousin. So? So, I don't even think that's legal in certain states. Well, what's the big deal? She's your cousin. You'll have plenty to talk about. Honey. Honey, it's your birthday. Relax. Relax. Have a good time. Oh, I've got to set up the karaoke. Oh, no, no! So how's Aunt Laura? Good. She's having a new hip put in next week. I need a drink. I need a big drink. Can I get you anything else? No. You're good? Okay. Yeah. Excuse me one second. I hope you're old enough to drink that. Uncle Jerry! What are you doing here? Oh. I thought you were in South America. Nepal. And I came back early. I couldn't miss the opportunity to see your mother embarrass you. Oh. You have no idea. She's out there trying to fix me up with my own cousin. Better make that a double. Coming up. So Nepal? That sounds exciting. I'm telling you, Flynn, there's a lot of money to be made in the import-export business. If you ever want a job, you can get out of that stuffy library job of yours, go out and see the world. Jerry, I think I'm okay. All right. Mmm. Anyway. Excuse me. Furniture wasn't the only thing I picked up in Nepal. Happy birthday, kiddo. Wow. This is amazing. It's a Tibetan shadow box. From the Qing Dynasty, judging from the woodwork. I figured you'd know more about the darn thing than I would. Open it up. That picture was taken shortly after I met your dad. That was, what, 38 years ago. The two of us. We were best friends right off the bat. After the war, your dad met your mother. Well, we both met her, but he swept her off her feet. Lucky bastard. You know, in the hospital, right after you were born, your dad made me swear that I would take care of you if anything ever happened to him. Now, I know I've said it before, but I just want to remind you I'm there for you if you ever need me. Yeah, I know. Thank you. Flynn, it's your turn to sing. Jerry, oh, I didn't think you would be able to come. Margie, you know, what is it? You get younger and more beautiful every time I see you. Come on, now. Let's join the party. The three of us can do a number together. We're gonna need this. There you are. Well, finally everyone left, thank God. You all right? Yeah, I'm just looking at some old pictures of me and Dad. I bet this day was really hard for you. I've been thinking about him all day. He was 32 when he died. I'm 32 now. And I feel like I didn't even know who he was. You know who he was. He was a dress salesman from Brooklyn and he loved his family. Now, what more did you need to know? Him. I hardly ever saw him. I mean, he was always traveling. He was gone all the time. I mean, I've got 22 degrees. I've got all this useless information at the tip of my fingers. I can't tell you one thing about my own father. I want to show you something. What? What do you got? It was very special. He bought this at a secondhand store. He would joke about it and say this was the Carson family seal, that we were descended from kings. He would put that on and tell you the most extraordinary bedtime stories about magical kingdoms and upside-down valleys. Yeah, and the laughing rocks. See, I remember. I remember. I used to draw pictures of it for him, waiting for him to come home. What? You did not. You saved these? Well, I thought you would want them someday. To remember him. Yeah. I remember the stories. I remember the silly little fantasies. But nothing about him. Well, I'm not so sure about that. Maybe these pictures say more than you realize. Oh, my God. Hello? Judson, it's me. I think you'd better get over here right away. What is it? Well, somebody sent me something in the mail today and I think... Flynn, are you-- are you still there? There's somebody in my apartment. Okay, I know you're in there. I have a weapon. Let's see if I can find some food for you. Flynn, are, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. Although, I think my head might disagree with me. You have a pretty nasty bump there. Who--who did this to you? Some guy was waiting for me when I came home. He was probably looking for... The scroll. It's gone. He took it. Somebody sent it to me in the mail. It was an ancient parchment. Vellum or papyrus. Probably at least 3,000 years old. It had a little symbol in the corner. Star of David and... A crescent moon at the bottom. Yeah. How did you know that? King Solomon's seal. King Solomon. It's been a while since I was in Sunday school. Let me see. Solomon ruled Israel during the 10th century, B.C. Regarded as being one of the Bible's wisest and richest kings. He stored his immense wealth in a golden temple built by 24 masons, hand-picked by Solomon himself. Correct. Only he didn't keep everything in the temple. For fear of looting, his personal prized possessions were secretly stored somewhere else. Wait a minute. Are you talking about King Solomon's Mines? That's just a legend, isn't it? Hello? Flynn, how long have you been working here? Right. For centuries, men have sought Solomon's treasures. Only the location of the Mines has never been found. It was rumored only the 24 masons knew and they devised a map. What you received in the mail was that map. That was a map? No, no, no, no. Just like a bunch of random symbols and markings. Sometimes looks can be deceiving. Okay, so if that was the map, then the guys that were in my apartment were actually looking for King Solomon's treasure. And you're just figuring that out now? I got hit on the head. Well, I'm afraid there's more. Key of Solomon. An ancient tome with incredible powers. It's believed that Solomon used those powers to rule his people. Yeah, I've heard of this before. It could summon the powers of the underworld. And it could bend space and time. If the Key of Solomon were ever to fall into the wrong hands... The fate of the world, right? Right. Fortunately for us, the map is useless without the legend piece to decipher it. The map legend is located in Volubilis, near the Roman ruins in--in Morocco. Roman ruins. Check. Flynn, retrieve the map and the legend, if you can. The location of King Solomon's Mines must never be found. Boy. That whole "I'm off on a mission "where there's a good chance I'll probably die" feeling, that never really goes away, does it? Look, don't worry. Just do what I've taught you to do, and--and you'll be fine. Your plane leaves in two hours. You're going to Casablanca. Casablanca? You mean like the movie Casablanca? Oh, I love that movie. Charleen, "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship." No, it's not. Be safe. Don't get killed. Save your receipts. Did you tell him? No. You should have told him. He'll find out soon enough. Rick's American Cafe, and make it snappy, pal. From the movie Casablanca. How delightfully original of you. The Volubilis ruins, please. Volubilis ruins, Bogey. Sorry, sorry. You're not digging deep enough. We haven't even broken through the sedimentary layer. Miss Emily, we've been digging for weeks and weeks and we have found nothing. Well, then, we widen the grid. We've done that already. Twice. Do it again. Till we find something. Who's that? Keep digging. Excuse me? Can I help you? Well, I hope you know how rare this is. Emblema mosaic, Roman, circa 40 A.D. 50 A.D., not 40. 50 A.D. Right. That's what I meant. I get confused. I was recently hit on the head. Hmm. Who are you? What do you want? My name is Flynn Carson. I'm with the Geological Institute. We're doing a soil survey in the region. You seem awfully familiar with Roman artifacts for a geologist. It's a hobby of mine. This is a private dig, Mr. Carson. I'm afraid your survey will have to wait. That's okay. I don't mind waiting. Okay. I do mind waiting. Computer imaging. High-resolution digital photography. This is a very impressive setup you have here, Miss... Davenport. Emily Davenport. What exactly are you looking for? If you don't mind me asking. Evidence to prove that this area was once ruled by the Queen of Sheba. Queen of Sheba? As in King Solomon's wife from the Old Testament. That's the one. But I thought that her reign only extended to parts of southern Arabia. Well, I'm going to prove otherwise. Excuse me. Have you found anything? A Roman antechamber in the southwest grid. What about something unusual? Like, say, for example, something that could be used to read a map. You're the second person to ask me that today. Somebody else was here? Yes. And they were snooping around rather like you are. Wow. Two people in the same day. That's quite a coincidence. Where did you say you were from again? I'm from the Geological Institute. So you must know John Binder over there. Tell me, how's old John doing these days? Very good. It's a trick question. There is no John Binder. He's the Head of the Institute. Damn. I knew it. You're here to steal my dig. Uh, no. Who sent you? Was it Pierre Buboul from the Sorbonne? Yes. Yes. You tell Pierre and his vultures... Now get off my site before I call security. If I could just have a minute of your time... Turito. Yes? Turito, it's okay. I'm going. I'm going. You don't give up, do you? You scared the hell out of me. What, do you sleep in here? This is a permit with my name on it. It means I can have you arrested for trespassing. And, believe me, you don't want to spend the night in a Moroccan jail. Look, Miss Davenport. Professor Davenport. I'm sorry I lied to you. But I'm not here to steal your dig. Then what are you here to do? It's a little hard to explain. Try me. I'm looking for a map legend that will help me decipher a map to King Solomon's Mines. You should have stuck with your geologist story. It was much more believable. I'm telling you the truth. And the map also tells you the location of Atlantis and Never-Never Land, too? What are you doing? I'm looking for a secret lever. You see, the Romans often built secret chambers into their architecture to hide their valuables. I know all about Roman architecture, thank you very much. There are no secret chambers here. There's always a secret chamber. Big words coming from a guy who thought the mosaic piece was from 40 A.D. Oh, look. A secret chamber. Do you know where you're standing? Claudius Ptolemy's tomb. The father of geometry and astronomy. Makes sense, really. If you want to find a map, find a mapmaker. Look at this. That is a reproduction of Ptolemy's famous atlas. You see, Ptolemy was among the first to theorize that the Earth was actually spherical. Look at the top and bottom of the globe. The alignment of the continents is all wrong. Just as I suspected. Oh, look at these symbols. Is that Hebrew? No, it's not Hebrew. Early Sumerian, maybe. It easily predates Ptolemy by 1,000 years. It's odd. I've never seen that symbol before. I have. The map legend must not leave the tomb. Well, can we talk about this? The legend is not yours to keep. We weren't-- we weren't gonna keep it. Speak for yourself. This is my dig. I have a permit. Now you die. A little help. Emily. Alakazam! The Order. What just happened? Amulet? The Order of the Cryptic Masons. You are one of us. Brother. Long have the descendants of the original 24 protected the secrets of Solomon. From Mason to Mason, the secret shall be passed. The map legend is yours. God be with you. I think we'd better be going. We got to go. We got to go. That way. Wait. The other half of the map legend is in Kenya near the Gedi Province. Journey between the Breasts of Sheba and you will find it with the All-seeing Eye. Now, go. Do you know where this leads? I thought you knew. Hey, look, an aqueduct. You see, the Romans often built... Enough with the history lessons. I know what it is. It's all dried out. There's moss growing inside. It's probably slippery enough, and I think gravity will take us. I knew I was going to regret meeting you. Can you give us a ride into town? The American got away. With the map piece. Find them. Those men back there are looking for King Solomon's Mines also? Yeah. And a book called the Key of Solomon. Well, if we want to get a jump on them, we'd better get going to Kenya. What? The other piece of the map legend is somewhere in the Gedi in Kenya. You don't even believe in King Solomon's Mines. That map legend is over 3,000 years old. The university will fund my dig for another 10 years if I bring them more of the same. I'm coming with you, Flynn. I don't need you. You need me to decipher the markings on the legend. I don't mean to brag, but I'm pretty good at deciphering dead languages. They're not written in a dead language. They're written in Akon, an ancient form of Hebrew cryptography. Go ahead. Take a peek. I can figure this out. If you know the 312-digit polyalphabetic cipher needed to decode it. Do you know the cipher? No. Wake me up when we get to the airport. Are you still trying to figure that out? I don't understand. I should be able to do this. I deciphered the language of the birds in seven hours. Give me a clue. Give me a little clue. No, no. Give me just the first three letters of the cipher. Gedi Province is about a day's drive from here. I've found us a ride. But you're not going to like it. Welcome, honeymooners, to the safari. We will have a short five-and-a-half hour drive. Flynn? Flynn Carson? Is that you? It's me. Debra Markham. Well, Debra Potter now. Remember, our mothers set us up on that date once. Yes. Yes, Debra. Social worker. Works with convicted felons. Right. Well, this is my husband, Carl. We met at work. And who is this sitting beside you? Is this your new wife? Yes. Yes. Yes. This is Emily. My beautiful, beautiful bride. What are you doing? I don't want my mother to know why I'm really here, so just play along, okay? Everyone, this is my friend, Flynn Carson, and his new wife, Emily. Let's give them both a big honeymooner welcome. Send us a postcard! This is as far as they take us. Gedi's a two-day hike on foot. Anything to get off that bus. Look at that. You know what that is? That's the Enkerendi. That's their mating dance. It's called Oloipiri, and it's their hunting dance. Enkerendi. Oloipiri. Why do you keep doing that, correcting me like that? You know, I'm not as dumb as you think I am. I don't think you're dumb. Just not as smart as I am. Well, I'll have you know I hold 12 bachelor's degrees, six master's and four PhDs, which is 22 total, which is almost a record. How many degrees do you have? Twenty-five, and I'll be starting my twenty-sixth next June. But who's counting? Excuse me. What, are we walking too fast now? Whoa. Are you all right? I've been better. Who did this to you? I was caught stealing crops on Bantu land. What, they just left you out here to die? I am Nulu. I would have done the same. Grab his hand. Here we go. Pull. I am Jomo. You have saved my life. Oh, hey, I don't know about all that. I'm indebted to you. You'll come with me to my village. There, you will be showered with food and women and treated like a king. Well, I saved you, too. Can't you see the man is talking? I'm sorry. You were saying something about a king? And how many women are we talking about? It's really very sweet of you, but we should be going because we're on our way to Gedi. Gedi? Well, I know the place. I will take you there. Where you go, Jomo will go. Oh, that's really not necessary. I will not rest until I have paid my debt to you. Jomo will get these for you. "How many women?" You heard the man. It's his custom. Want a chocolate bar? Not for me. Oh, look, a hoopoe bird. Two thousand years ago, King Solomon used to send birds to fly messages across to the Queen of Sheba. And now, here it is, all those years later, flying over our heads. You've always been interested in the Queen of Sheba? Ever since I was a little girl. I used to stay awake all night long, reading the same old stories about her. So much power, mystery. She could have been the queen of all Africa. Sounds good to me. Well, the trick is proving it. And I haven't had much luck with that. Well, just 'cause you haven't found any evidence yet doesn't mean that you won't. One has to have a little faith. What's going on? Hippos, the deadliest animal in Africa. They're highly territorial. They'll tear us to shreds. Hippos have incredible auditory faculties. If we remain quiet and try not to breathe, they might leave us alone. Whoa. All right, actually, I'm going to disagree with you. Maybe, if we sound a threatening call, we might be able to drive them off. Shut up, you idiot. We have to be quiet. No, we have to try and scare them off. We have to make noise. Be quiet! Stop, you moron. They're attacking us. It's a defensive action. We're making progress. Hippos like chocolate. Thank you. Get out of the way. Hey, Jomo. You think maybe we could take a little break? Just for an hour? Three, tops. We rest here for five minutes, we eat and then we go. Yes. Anything. Come. Eat. Oh. Wow. Do you have any of those little chocolates? Yeah. I'm way ahead of you. My drawings. I don't believe it. My mom. She must have snuck them in my bag when I wasn't looking. You still live with your mother. What? Who, me? No. No, no. Not anymore. I mean, I moved out. No, I got my own apartment now. Yeah, I know. It's a little embarrassing. Don't worry. I slept at home all through grad school. May I? Yeah. Well, you're no Picasso, that's for sure. Give me a break. I was 8 years old. Still. Okay. Time to go. So what are those drawings of, anyway? Bedtime stories. My dad used to tell me these silly bedtime stories, and I would draw them for him. I bet he appreciated that. I guess. I never really knew my dad. He died when I was young. He got mugged coming home from work, and the coward shot him. Never even caught who did it. Oh, I'm sorry, Flynn. Unfortunately, those silly bedtime stories are all I have left. My father never read me bedtime stories. He was always too busy working or fighting with my mother. I never talked to him growing up. And he's still alive, and I still don't talk to him. Seems to me, you had a good father. You see? Gedi Province. Now what? Now we have to look for something called the Breasts of Sheba or the All-seeing Eye. Whatever that means. I think I found the Breasts of Sheba. See the two mountains there? See how they kind of resemble the... Well, the... I get it, Flynn. They told me there's a mystic shop in the next village run by a fortune teller. There we will find the All-seeing Eye. Thank you for everything. You were a huge help. It is over? Yeah, we're just gonna go into town and grab that map legend piece, head on home, so, I think we can take it from here. I have not yet repaid my debt to you. Sure you have. You brought us here. You saved us from the hippos and didn't make us eat the termites. I think we're even. Go well. We will. The All-seeing Eye. The All-seeing Eye. May I help you? Are you the owner of this shop? Yes. Come in, please. It's okay. Go ahead. The store belonged to my father. It was his pride and joy. Where is your father now? He died. Not too long ago. It was my father's dying wish that I continue his legacy. So, I inherited the store from him. Well, they say the secrets shall be passed. Indeed, they shall. Among other things. I received this from a Cryptic Mason in Morocco. He told me I could find the other half to it here. Finally, the key to King Solomon Mines. The other half? Yes. It's here. Unfortunately, my father, God rest his soul, he passed away before he could reveal its hidden location. But, perhaps, you could help me search for it? Thank you. Hmm? What do we have in here? What the... It's my drawing. You found something? Well, there's something hidden inside this wall. What the... It's the other half of the map legend. What are you doing? He's one of them. A bad guy. Run, run, run. Go, go, go, go. No. We'll have to jump. Are you nuts? No, no, no, that store awning should slow our freefall velocity by at least 47%. 34. 47%. 34. Would you stop arguing with me? They have the legend. Go! Get them! They have the map! Flynn. Uncle Jerry? What are you doing here? I'm on my way to Mombasa to pick up some exports. What are you doing here? Uh, we're in a little bit of trouble. We gotta get out of here. Can you help us? I've got some cabins on the train, get on. Go. Find them! Now! They're on the train! Those look like General Samir's men. You're lucky you ran into me when you did. General Samir? He the head of a militia around these parts. Very dangerous. Look, Flynn, these are very unstable lands. It's no time to be caught in the middle of a war. Too late. Come in. Hey, you about ready for--for... That's a native Masai dress, I believe. Yes, it is. Your uncle Jerry gave it to me. Do you like it? Yeah, it's not bad. Shall we, before it gets cold? Yep, so, we had this book signing packed with people, and Flynn, this little 9-year-old in short pants, walks up to the author and starts arguing with him, telling him his book is all wrong. The man's thesis was unsound, I was just pointing it out. It was Stephen Hawking. A 9-year-old does not argue with Stephen Hawking. The man's a genius. Well, now... One moment, sir. Not for me. This has gone straight to my head. And I shall be retiring to my cabin. Thank you for my dress. Oops! Careful. So, what are you gonna do next? You going after this King Solomon's treasure, whatever you said it was? I don't know yet. I think you should come to Mombasa with me. Your mother would have a heart attack if she knew what you were up to. Flynn, are you all right? Sir, your tej. Yeah, yeah. You know, I was just thinking about Dad. You guys knew each other pretty well, didn't you? Well, he was my best friend. I'd like to think so. Is it possible that he could've had a secret life? Secret? You mean like you? Well, we all have our secrets, Flynn. I guess your dad was no different. Take this amulet. He was wearing this when I first met him. And I don't think I ever saw him take it off. He told Mom he got that at a secondhand shop. Your dad did tell me that he was given this by his father, who got it from his father before him and on down the line. This amulet is part of your legacy. Passed on from generation to generation. The secret shall be passed. Flynn, what are you mixed up in? Thank you for everything, Uncle Jerry. Oh. Hey. I was, uh, just going over the map and legend pieces. Trying to figure them out. Any luck? Well, I connected the two pieces of the map legend. And I deciphered the markings. They reference the Old Testament. Specifically the... Song of Solomon. How do you know? I cracked the Akon cipher last night. You did? It wasn't that hard, actually. It just the Egyptian lined equation, with a multi-varied calculus thrown in. Don't know what I was thinking. Why didn't you tell me you figured it out? If you know the cipher, then you don't need me anymore. Well, I guess I just liked having you around. So, the Song of Solomon. What does a series of love poems from the Bible have to do with this map? May I? Maybe this holds the answer. Maybe we're supposed to use this somehow to read the map. It has a purpose. I don't know what it is. You can let go now. Okay. The Song of Solomon mentions kissing, doesn't it? I think so. "Let him kiss me with his mouth "for thy kisses are sweeter than gold." Wine. What? "Thy kisses are sweeter than wine." You said gold. That's because I'm pretty sure it is gold. And I'm pretty sure it's wine. No, it's gold. Wine. It's gold. Wine! And to think that I came that close to falling for somebody who can't stop correcting me every second of the day. I only correct you every second of the day because you're wrong every second of the day! I was reciting poetry! I was trying to be romantic. Romance isn't about being shot at, being bloody dragged across Africa. It's about music and chocolates and flowers and... Say that again. It's about music and chocolates and... Music. That's it! I can't believe I didn't see that before. It's so easy, it's so obvious. Don't you get it? The Song of Solomon is literally the song of Solomon. This isn't a map. This is sheet music. That legend... ...is an instrument used to play the notes. Thank God for clarinet lessons. Nope. Sorry. One more time. Did you see that? Uh-huh. Three Witches Mountain. The mines are inside that mountain. You do have your moments, Flynn Carson. Uh, Flynn, are you there? Come in, Flynn. Okay, this is too much. Is there something I can help you with? Did you retrieve the map legend? Yes. And the map also. The location of King Solomon's Mines is safe? All right. Grab the first plane out and return to the library. I'm not coming home right away, Judson. I'm going to the Mines. It's dangerous, Flynn. I mean, if the Key of Solomon should fall into the wrong hands... It won't, okay? Listen, why don't you just trust me one time? I don't have any choice. I have to go. Just remember that sometimes you have to give up what you want for the greater good. Okay, I gotta go. Take care. I just wish you'd reconsider and come back to Mombasa with me. Leave this treasure hunting to the professionals. I'll be fine, Uncle Jerry. Morning. Hello. What do you have there? Oh, just some stuff that I picked up in town. Mmm-hmm. And I thought that you didn't believe in King Solomon's Mines. I don't. It's just standard hiking gear in case we need it. Uh-huh. I guess you better be going. Hey, thank you for everything. You be careful, kiddo. You too, gorgeous. Goodbye. Now I know why this place seems so familiar. I've been here before. You have? Yeah. My father's bedtime stories. This is the place he was talking about. The laughing rocks. He was here. And he knew that one day I would be here, too. He was preparing me for it. Well, I guess these aren't useless after all. Timber, wood, tree. The baobab tree. The oldest tree in Africa. Over 3,000 years old. That would put it around the time of Solomon. That's hollow. We must, uh, we must be underneath the mountain now. Watch your step going through here. This ground is very, very... Flynn? Flynn, you all right? Slippery. I was going to say the ground is very slippery. Where are we? Turn off the flashlight. Desmodus rotundus. Vampire bats. Filthy, disgusting vampire bats. Yeah, they're sensitive to light. We don't want to disturb them. Hello. What is this? I think I'm gonna hurl. Oh, please. Come on. We have to cross that? If I remember the map correctly, that should be the entrance to King Solomon's treasure chamber. So, yes. Piece of cake. Okay. Okay. This is it? Where's the book? Where's the treasure? What kind of treasure chamber doesn't have any treasure? Wasting so much time chasing myths and legends. I actually believed that I might find something. Thanks, Dad. Instead, I've been practically killed by a madman. And hippos. You had the key with you all this time. Okay, just go, just go. Just go. Now do you believe that? Oh, my. The Book of Genesis. I'm holding the Book of Genesis. Dead Sea Scrolls, every single one of them. Sheba. The Book of Solomon. Flynn? Flynn! I think we should be going. Give me the book. Give it to me. Look who it is. Jerry. Stop. Stop. I'll give you the book. Just don't hurt him anymore. Sorry, Flynn, but I told you not to come here, didn't I? You bastard. You work for them. Oh, you've got it backwards, darling. They work for me. Jerry! What did I say? "Leave the treasure hunting to the professionals." But, no, you had to come here. How'd you find out about the Mines? I begged your father to tell me where it was, but he refused. He was so stubborn. He kept refusing, right up until the moment I shot him. You shot my father? He was your best friend. I hated him for taking your mother away from me. I hated him for having the family I never had. Your father had everything and I had nothing! The power of this book will change all that. With it I can bend space and time and take back all that's rightfully mine. I can rewrite my own history. No, you can't use that book. You know how dangerous it is. The incantation must be read in a special chamber here in the Mines. What a shame. You're gonna miss it. What, are you going to kill us, too, Jerry? You're like a son to me, Flynn. I could never kill you. I've got General Samir to do that for me. Oh, you better hope he does. Just make sure they don't suffer... much. It would be so easy to shoot you both, but this would be so much more fun. Here, try this. We're going to drown! What are you doing? I'm looking for a secret chamber! Enough with the secret chambers already! We are going to die! Why don't you think of something? You're the one with 25 PhDs! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! "By all the other names of God Almighty, we powerfully command ye..." Help! We'll be crushed to death! I'd say we're probably going to drown first. The water level's rising much faster than... Shut up! Save your oxygen. I'm going to try the grate again. Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! Flynn! I was, uh, I was never very good at this. Am I dead? Do you-- do you want to be? Good, good. Then you're not. Oh. Oh, there we go. That's better. Only you, Flynn, can protect Solomon's secrets. It's your legacy. You must follow in your father's footsteps. I don't understand. You will. Now, I need you to do one more thing for me. What's that? Open your eyes. Jomo. Jomo. Now we are even. "By all the other names of God Almighty, we powerfully command ye." Where are we? We're in the Chamber of the Dead Kings. What's he doing? He's reading the Grimorian Incantation that will allow the dead to rise. Is that bad? Well, it's not good. If the spirits enter the Altar of the Flame, it's not gonna be pretty. Here's the plan. We're going to draw them out one at a time and concentrate all their power in the center. Then we go right, we go left, then we take the front. Brilliant. Thank you. Have you considered the Boris Spassky defense could be simpler? Don't you... "Ye who by your own..." That works, too. "...before His throne by Him who had "cast ye down unto the most profound..." I should have shot you when I had the chance. Get the book. "Open the portal, and ye... "Let the gateway appear... "O Great One, strong and powerful, "rise from your sleep so that you may aid me in my work. "Come ye. Come ye, angels of darkness. "Come hither before this circle without fear and terror." "Long before the constitution of the world, "by the names of the true princes of the universe, "by the rod of Moses, by the staff of Jacob, "by the ring and seal of David, "wherein are writ the names of sovereign God, "I conjure thee, O creatures of fire, "open the portal. "Go to the light and grant my desire." Ghosts. I hate ghosts. I can hear you breathing. I'm going to kill you. "...and before the tribunal of the judgment of His Majesty, "and before the holy angels of darkness "hear the sentence of your condemnation. "Come ye then." It's working. It's working. "Which the very spirit of God hath moved, by the sun and by the stars, "by the waters, by the sea and all which they contain, "by the whirlwinds and the tempests, "O demons, aid me in my work. "I conjure ye anew by these other names of God. "Both holy and unknown. "Now grant me the power of Solomon!" You should be back at your stuffy job, stacking books. You'd be surprised what you can learn at the library. Give me the book. Don't come any closer or I'll destroy it. You wouldn't dare. Flynn, don't. Imagine the power, Flynn. You could control all space and time, make your wildest dreams come true. I don't care about any of that. You could see your father again! Use the book, Flynn. Finish reading the incantations, and bring your father back to you. He would put that on and tell you the most extraordinary bedtime stories about magical kingdoms and with upside-down valleys. Yes. Read the words. Read it. "Bless O Lord, all-powerful and all-merciful..." Bring him back to you. That's it. Read the words. "This creature of fire, so that, being blessed by thee, "it may be for the honor and glory of thy most holy name. "I conjure thee, O creature of fire, "by Him who removeth the Earth and maketh it tremble "and now burn and torment these spirits "so that they may feel it intensely, "that they may be burned eternally by thee, "I exorcize thee, O creature of fire." Flynn? Stop! Don't you see what you're doing? "That they may work no hindrance or evil unto those who use it. "Through thee, O eternal and almighty Lord, "through thy most holy name, bring back those I've loved and lost." "Bring my father to me." No. Don't do it. No. What are you doing? No, no! No! Don't do it. Stop! Read it! Don't you want to be with your father again? My father has been with me the whole time. No! Flynn, get out of there! You can let go now. Jomo, I don't know how to thank you. I couldn't have done it without you. I have been your guide, but it was you who led the way. I have a little something for you. No. No, no, no. That belongs to you. No, this belongs to you. I can't think of anybody I would rather have protect King Solomon's secret than you. I have something for you. In case of hippos. In case of hippos. Next time I'm in Kenya, I'll be sure to stop by the Nulu tribe. I will treat you like a queen. A queen? Did you hear that? Finally some respect. Flight 382 now boarding to New York. You want to be treated like a queen, wait till my mother meets you. This is our plane right over here. I'm not going. I booked a flight to Tunisia instead. You did? There's a dig there. They found some first-century pottery shards that could be linked to Sheba. It's a shot in the dark. Thought you were all done chasing myths and legends. Yeah, well, let's just say I got a little inspiration. So, this is it? I guess so. Well, I'm not very good at goodbyes. Neither am I. I'm really not very good at goodbyes. I'm really not good, either. Well, I think I'm a little worse at them... Flynn? Will I see you again? One has to have a little faith. "Of all the gin joints in all the world she had to walk into mine." $500 to the Magical Honeymoon Tour? Oh, which reminds me. Your mother called. She sounded furious. Something about you getting married and not telling her? Don't ask. Okay. Itemize these next time, will you? I'm glad you're home. Excalibur? Oh. Oh, Flynn, I--I didn't know you were back. Judson. So, how did your trip go? Oh, not so well. Destroyed the book, which wasn't very librarian of me. You sacrificed what you really wanted for the greater good. Only a great librarian would do that. What about your father? Did you find all the answers you wanted? Yeah. But I think you knew that already. eBay. I didn't say anything about flying kites. Oh. You have got to tell me how you did that.
