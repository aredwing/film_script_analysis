Sometimes where you see them... Sometimes where you don't. I know that now. Momma. Stop. Stop shaking me. Get up! Stop. Did I oversleep? Yes. Get up. I am getting up. You said 8:00, it's 9:00! Are you ready to go? I packed for me, and I packed for you. Where's Roy? He said he was gonna call me. He's an ass. Damn it, Elizabeth. Get up. Go load the car. I should have had dad pick me up. Excuse me. Get up. I will. Get up. I am. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I fell back asleep. I'm sorry, okay! You can't smoke in the car. Fine. Quit playing with that. Give it! Give it! You're too old for that. You're too old for a lot of things. Turn on the car, roll down the window. I was gonna give you this when we got there. It was grandma's. Yeah. Why are you giving it to me? Because you're not coming back. I didn't say that. Yeah, but you're not gonna... If we stop in Darlington tonight... It's only 4 hours until we get there. Yeah. Just tell me when you wanna stop. You know what? Honestly, Lizzy, I'm done, okay? Just get in the goddamn car! I don't want to! I don't care! I'm not gonna ask you again. Look, I know this is a big night for you. I don't care! Yes, you do! It's my play! Yes, and you are going to be late. Get in the goddamn car! Get your ass in there right now! I don't want you to go. I don't want you to go. I don't want you to go. What did you say? I don't want you there! Well, that is some tough fucking shit, because I'm going. This is a big night for you and I know that. Just drop me off. Fuck you! Don't talk to me like that. Fuck you, fuck you. Don't talk to me like that. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you! I hate you. Fuck you. I hate you. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! I hate you! I hate you. It's my play. You never come, you never care, you never come to anything! You know what? You know what? Find your own goddamn ride! Fuck you! You sure you want to keep going? I called dad and Jenna, they said they'll stay up. I wanna sleep there. Are you tired? No, I'll be fine. I think it's gonna rain. I hate thunder. I know you do. Hey... can I? Crack your window. What time is it? I don't know. Why don't you tell me? It's 12... :15. And not a soul in sight. Don't do that. I'm just kidding. It's not funny. You need to lighten up. I wish you listened more. I wish you'd quit saying that. Oh shit... damn it! Oh, god! Baby! Are you okay? Look at me! Are you okay? Are you okay? Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. Mommy. Just tell me what hurts. Ow! Mom! Ow, my wrist! Fuck! Oh, god. Mom, you're bleeding. Are you sure you're okay? Mom, what do we do? We gotta call 9-1-1. Oh, shit. Hello? We've been in a accident. My mom has... she hurt her head, it's bleeding. Where are we? Tell them we passed the 40 like 30 minutes ago, going south. We passed the 40 about 30 minutes ago. Tell them that we... At that fork... Where there's construction... Tell them where there's construction... We went on the old road. We're on the old road. I don't... I don't know. Okay. What did they say? They're sending an ambulance and a tow truck thing. See if there's a band-aid in my purse. You want to get out? What if it's still alive? Baby, look at it. It hasn't moved. But still... Ow! Okay, try your side. Hey... it's all right. Come on, be brave. Climb out. Baby? You're gonna need to call your dad. He can come get you wherever they're taking us. What are you gonna do? I gotta deal with this. I'll have Roy come and get me in the morning. Call him. Hi, dad? Dad, we got into an accident. No, I'm okay. Yeah, so is mom. Um, no, dad... she wasn't. Dad, she's fine. No, it... it was raining and there was something in the road. It was scary. We hit a wolf. Yeah, mom made me call. Oh, god. Oh, come on, come on, come on. You can do it, you can lick it, baby. Just don't do it, just don't do it, just go to fucking bed. Just go to bed. Just go to bed. Oh, fuck, fuck. Is it dead? I don't know. It looks dead. Yeah... it does. Look at this. Let's go back to the car. Okay. Some of those cuts on the wolf weren't from the crash. I think it was fighting with something. What? I don't know, there are lots of things that hide in the woods. Can I see your arm? Stay still. Oh, thank god. Maybe he knows... Where they'll be taking us. Momma... Uh-huh. Where'd the wolf go? Ma'am? Ma'am, you all right? Yeah, yeah, we're fine. We're fine, it's just my wrist. Sorry, sweetheart. Station called, said the ambulance is gonna be a bit. Let me get your things, put 'em in my truck. I'll get your car ready. Okay. Thank you. I don't want to get out. Baby, that thing probably just crawled into the woods to die. That's all. My name's Jesse. Hey. I hope y'all aren't too shaken up. We hit a wolf, if you can believe it. Get out, I want to help him. Well, nobody much takes this road any more. I'm not surprised that animals don't think twice... About crossing it. Where'd it go? Uh, I think it got up. Well, shit... must've just spooked it then. All right, that's it. Your ambulance will be coming in a minute. Okay. There's a big wreck on the highway... It's slowing everything down. It's okay, I think we'll just stay in this car. Can you hook it up with us in there? Yeah, yeah, y'all right, go on. Aw, dang it. You got a... Axel broke in half. You got oil pouring out like it's trying to get away. I'm gonna have to work on it before we get going. You want to pop it? Pop it? Why would it run out in the road? Who knows? It had to have seen us, right? It's probably just running. From what? Dogs don't got teeth like this. Their teeth are small. We hit a wolf. Damn it! What time is it? Late. Late 30 or late 45? Stay in there. Baby, where'd you put my phone? I want to call your dad. I think it's in my bag. He took it? Holy... son of a bitch. Go tell him we want our phone. Go tell him. Do I have to? We have to call your dad, go on. Go on, he's gonna be worried. Okay, I'm going. I'm going. Mister? Jesse. Mr. Jesse, we need our phone. I'll be out in a minute. You can go get it yourself. Mister! I need the key! Oh, goddamn it! I'll be out in a sec! Momma, come look! Momma? Oh, shit. Mom! I found it! I found the wolf! Sorry we hit you. Momma? I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. Go away. Should have got you a jacket. Come here. Did you hear me out there? Uh, no, I guess not. I called for you. What happened? I found it. Found what? The wolf. Where'd you see it? In the woods. Something ate it. Should have left it alone. I did! Come on! Goddamn it! We're gonna be gone soon, and you know... Birds will eat it in the morning. What would do that? Baby, are you scared? Hey! It's not gonna come after people. You promise? I promise. Where is the fucking ambulance? Let's go, man! Come on! What's his name? Jesse. Jesse. Hey, Jesse! Come on, man, let's go! Mister? Hang on a sec. Where is he? He's down there. Why won't he answer? I don't hear him. Hey! Jesse? Momma? I'm going out there. Let's just wait here... please! You stop making this into a thing. Honestly, stop. Don't get weird on me. I'm just gonna go out and find him. Why? Because I don't just sit. Don't go. Not one word out of you, not one more word. You hear me, Lizzy? Is he there? Jesse! Where is he? You out there? Oh, my god, oh, my god. Oh! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. The ambulance will be here soon. What if they never get here? Stop, don't... don't think like that. Don't think like that. They're coming. They're on their way. I want my daddy. Hey... hey! I'm right here. I don't care. Hey. I told you... I told you not to get out of the car... And you never listen to me. Nothing happened. Nothing happened. He could have killed you. Nothing happened to me. I'm okay, I'm right here. I'm right here. Momma? What? What do we do? I don't know. I don't know. Please don't! Please? We can't just leave him out there. Please? Agh! Oh, no! Agh! I don't know what to do. I know what you think, okay! I know what you think! What is it? What? I see it. Turn around! Turn around! Turn around! Mom, where is it? I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! Where is it? Where is it? Don't look. Don't look, don't look. Mom. Ssh... it's okay. It's okay. It's not. You're an idiot! You think you're so fucking smart, don't you? Well, maybe I feel a little less with you being here. I told you, over and over and over again... Don't touch my fucking beer! It's my house! It's my fucking beer! It's my fucking house! Dumb ass, it's not in there. I told you it's not in there. I know it's not in there! I know where I put them! Lizzy, where are you! Lizzy!

If we can get his keys, we can get out of here. He had them. He might have dropped them. Momma, I don't want you to. I could just peek. You can stay here. Stay, stay here with doggy. Mommy. Be very quiet. Be very quiet. It's okay. What's out there? I'm not sure. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ssh. Be still. Be still. Be still, be still. Stay quiet.
