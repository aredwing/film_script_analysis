The mayor's besieged. You don't come forward till Mr. Walker's handing out promotions, and you come up with a joke. It's no joke, mister. If it was a white man, wouldn't be no joke. - Sir- - You work for this city? Are you a member of this police force or aren't you? Yes, sir. We were told to stand down. The lieu passed it down. This case didn't exist. Do you have something? What do you have? We got the mayor out there hanging in the breeze. Yes, sir. I'm saying, but the F.B.I. - What have you got?

A minute is something that we don't got. - Talkin' to a stone wall. - Uh-huh. - You're wasting your time, Bob. - I'll be the judge of that. - Why do you do this shit? - Shut up! We got to find him. Don't do this the hard way. Look at me. Now, don't do this the hard way. - We can help you. - Mmm. It's a bad beat and you're stuck in it, and it's gonna be some crying. But our way is the easy way. Listen to me. We need your son... but we don't need him dead. You want him alive? Work with us. We got to bring him in. - You want to kill him. - We need to take him. But we need him alive. That's the job we were given to do. That's why they gave it to the cops 'stead of the F.B.I. Our job is to bring him down alive. - That's what they sent us for. It's that simple. That's what it is. Listen to me. I know that it stinks. I know that there's so much death in the world. I know that it's full of hate, mama. I know that it all turns out wrong. Here we are. Here we are. We're the garbagemen. You think I don't know that? I know that. Looking for something to love. You got something to love. You got your boys. That's something. Look in my eyes. I want to save your son. Before God... I want to save your boy. Will you help me? - Uh, Bob? - Not now. - The lieutenant. - Not now. He needs you on the phone. He says now. Time's running out. Let's ride, mama. - What the fuck does he want? - It's the Yids. - Blow 'em off. - The doctor. Somebody took a shot at - - Somebody took a shot at - - That's what they said. Bullshit. Bullshit! One of the men who was at the medical examiner's office... assured me they will release it before the end of the day. - What is it? - They say a shot fired at them. Some guy on the roof. - A shot fired? Yes or no? - I don't know. Didn't hit nothin' if it did. - Well, who heard it? - The lady. The lady? What lady? Get the lady in here so she can show me. - I'll show you. - You'll show me what, sir? - Who made the call? - I made the call. - What are we looking at? What's going on here? - It happened here. What happened? Give me this number right now. My partner- Get him. - There was a man on the roof. - Uh-huh. - And my wife heard a shot. - Uh-huh. She heard a shot. Yes, she did. Would she know what a shot sounds like? How would she know that? - My wife heard a shot. - There was a shot on the roof. There was a man on the roof. A man on the roof. - Yes, ma'am. - No, no, I'm not making it up. It happened. There was shooting. - Ma'am, I don't know any reason why anyone - - That's right. You don't, do you? But I see that you feel that, what -you're dealing with hysterical Jews? I'm making it up. Is that right? We're always making it up. Is that right? It's all right, dear. Let me tell you one thing. - There was a man on the roof. - Look, can I talk to you for a second? Look, Doctor, why would anybody be shooting at you? - You follow me? - Do I follow you? Look, you - You're under a lot of stress today-your tragedy. I'm sorry for you, what happened to your mother. I'm gonna station a man on the roof. You keep away from this side of the house. Okay? It's always a fantasy, isn't it? A fantasy? What's a fantasy? I don't get you. When someone wants to hurt the Jews. I've got nothing against theJews, Doctor. I'm a Jew. And I'll tell you something else - When the fantasy is true, when we've been killed... then you say, ''What a coincidence that at the same time we were being paranoid... someone was coincidentally trying to hurt us.'' What can I have against the Jewish people, Doctor? I'm sorry what happened to your mother. You say you saw someone on the roof. I'm putting a man there. You tell me what more you think that I can do. All right? I'm just trying to do my job. I'm sorry. You're trying to do your job? Let's be frank, shall we? Can we do that? - Sir, do you want to be frank? - Yes, I do. - I don't get the whole fuckin' thing. - It amounts to this. My mother was killed. You're assigned to the case. I called downtown. They say you're a good detective. I want you to find her murderer, and I want protection. I know you think this is a bullshit case. I don't care. You're paid to do ajob. Do your fucking job. - Have you got the pride for that? - Don't get in my face, man. Have you got the pride to do the job you were given? Do your job, or else. Don't tell me ''or else.'' Don't tell me ''or else.'' I'm gonna do the job. I'm not scared of your money, I'm not scared of you, and I don't need your threats. - I'm here to do the job! - Excuse me. Excuse me. There was a disturbance. It's nothing. It's nothing to be alarmed at. - My partner? - Got to him. He says don't move. He's getting back to you this number, Okay, thanks. - Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry about your grandma. - Thank you so much for coming. - Mama, I have to talk to you. - Yes, darling. Dear, go ahead. Where is the photograph? What's he saying? Do you speak Hebrew? It's not Hebrew. He's speaking Yiddish. - He's - He says the years they spent working together... his time with her and with - and with her husband... were the closest ties he ever had with any living being. He calls her a great woman. He's praising her courage... in the years before the formation of the state of Israel... and he's talking about when they- When they what? - It's - You know, it's jargon language Yiddish. I-I-I don't speak Yiddish that well. Detective, you're wanted on the phone in the study. - Thanks. - You need anything else? No, no, just, uh, hang tight. And shut the door, will ya? Detective Gold. Tim! She -The old lady. She gonna give him up? She gonna give him up? You got her? You worked her around. Fantastic! Oh, fuck me! Why do I always miss it? She said what? Oh, yeah, I'm the linchpin. Big deal. Oh, man. Was it sweet? I would have been there. I'm stuck here with my- my Jews. You should see this fuckin' room. No, fuckin' bullshit. Bunch of high-strung fuckin' bullshit. They pay so much taxes - Fuck 'em. Yo! She did? Fan-fuckin'-tastic! What? Oh, some bullshit. Somebody's taking shots at 'em. Hey, fuck 'em. Don't tell me. Don't send the old ladywork down there and tell me how you're so surprised. Fuck 'em and the taxes they pay. You tell me. Ten more bucks a week they're makin', lettin' her work down there? Ha! Hey, not my people, baby. Fuck 'em. There's so much anti-Semitism the last 4,000 years... we must be doin' somethin' bring it about. I'll see you at the house half an hour. Yo, Tim. See you then. My grandmother was killed today. She stayed down there because she wanted to stay there. She was a fighter. She wanted to die there. She died there. You're a Jew, and you talk that way in the house of the dead. - Do you have any shame? - I'm sorry about your grandmother. No one asked you to be sorry. No one asked for your sympathy. We would have appreciated your respect. Do you hate yourself that much? Do you belong nowhere? I - I'll find the killer. I - I swear I'll find the killer. I swear. Listen to me. Please! I'll- It was a backfire. What do you think? I think it was a car backfiring. How do I get to their roof? Through the kitchen. You want backup? No. Keep 'em out of here. Hey! Hey! No, I, uh, think everything is all right now. We've got men all over. Everything is fine. There was someone on the roof. - It's all my fault. - This is terrible. Excuse me. Can you think of anyone who would want to harm them? - Did they have any enemies? - No. They have a lot of money. What was the old lady doing working down there? - I don't want to talk about the family. -Just tell me that. Sh - She... made the money down there, put the kids through school. She wanted to stay there. She used to work in Palestine? That's right. Excuse me. - Detective? - Yeah. How are ya? Fine, thanks. Always coldest just before the dawn. Yes, I remember that. You going in? Yeah. Where are the lights? Some valuable stuff down in the cellar? Hey, that's just something they said. Something the kids been sayin' anound here for years. See for yourself. Nothin' down there. - Hmm. - Dust on the stairs. - Ain't nobody been down there in years. - Uh-huh. They say she kept a piece behind the counter. But what is that gonna do, some guy comes in with a shotgun? And how are you gonna be watchin' the door all day? - Uh-huh. - Every day, huh? You can't do it. So I say I'm gonna be in here someday, she gets popped. And it was just a question of when, no more, no less. Tell you somethin' else. I don't know that her coming here does not make violence. Rich Jew lady in this neighborhood is gon' get took off. Human nature. Someday somebody gonna come in here, see what it is. You okay down there? Yeah, I'm fine. You all right down there, Detective? Mm-hmm. ''Hauser. Greenblatts. Samson. Greenwald. Klein. Gross.'' Good morning. Get this to the A.T.F., will you? Good morning. And make me copies. An invoice - and a list of names. And please, run this through the computer- ''Grofaz.'' - Grofaz? - G-R-O-F-A-Z. What is it, a name? - I don't know what it is. - All right. Have a good day. Get up, Mr. Wells. I'm taking you in for arraignment. - Detective. - Yeah. - I need you to file a complaint on this man. - Complaint? - He assaulted you. - Forget it. Assault police officer, attempted escape. Yeah, forget it. Fuckin' guy shot his wife and kids. What are they gonna do to him for beating on me? Sir, the thing is you need to make an example of this guy hittin' on a cop. Hey, leave it, all right? I won't forget this, Officer. Thank you. I'll make it up to you. I promise. - You're gonna make it up to me? - Yes, I will. Your kindness has changed my life. Well, that's swell. And someday, I'll repay you. Uh-huh. My thoughts are elsewhere. You must pardon me. Yeah. Grofaz. G-R-O-F-A-Z. - Hi. - How you doing, Billy? Okay. You all alone here today? Yeah, I'm never going home. Here. Keep it. - Thanks. - Anything you might have. Particularly anything connected with anti-Jewish acts. Well, if you do, will you please call me here? Thank you. That's him. That's the man. - What's happening, Brown? - That's him. You're the one. I'm gonna do it, but I'm gonna do it with you. You're gonna take him in like you told me, nice and gentle. - No harm will come to him. - No harm will come to him. - You swore that. - Well, you won her a round, my man. - I did? - You said the magic word. The duck came down. Here's the setup: She's gonna tell him she's gonna get him out of the country, get him a ticket. -Jilly, you want to come in here? - Hold it a minute, Frank. We have her tell Randolph she's gonna get the passport of a friend of his. So Randolph thinks he's gonna take the passport, go to South America. - We have his mom set up a date with him. -Jilly, I gotta work on this thing here. No, Bob. The broad won't show unless you're there. You're the man gonna bring him in. - 5.:00a.m. tomorrow. - I gotta work on this thing. - Put it on the shelf. - I can't. You've got to. We're taking Randolph 5:00 a.m. tomorrow. You're gonna be there. Get over to passport office right now. Sully's waiting for 'em. Give 'em those pictures. - Hey, this is the big one, Bob. - Jilly! Comin', Frank. Get over to passport office right now. This rendezvous with Randolph takes place at 5.:00a.m.... at, uh - at Third and, uh - Bob? - I was out all night on this. - Uh-huh. What do you make of it? I got a picture of this woman, taken in Wisconsin. Nice old Jewish woman with a tommy gun. All right? What is she doing with an invoice for these tommy guns in the basement? I got, um - Last night. I got Israeli heavy hitters coming in. I got some guy on the roof. - Yeah, well, it's a mystery, isn't it? - Look. - This was taken in Wisconsin, 1946. - Bob. Bob. Hey, Bob. Hey. Get out of it. We got a job to do. Tonight the balloon goes up. The old days, Bobby, huh? You bust a case... bottle comes out, stick your feet up on the filing cabinet, eh? We lure Randolph out, we take him in. Third and Racine. You got it? - This other case - - Fuck the other case. What other case? What other case? - This Jewish - - It's a candy store pop. Just look busy on it. I -Well, you know, I caught the case. What i - What is there, a broad in it? Hmm? What's the thing? It's just - I think it's some - some sort of conspiracy. - Some sort of conspiracy. - They said somebody was shooting at them. Someone was shooting at them. The Jew family? - Yes. - Was there someone shooting at them? Hmm? Bob? Hmm? Hey. You got some -You got some heavy troubles on your mind? Huh? Babe? We'll work it out. We'll play some cops and robbers. We'll bust this big criminal. We'll swagger around. - You're like my family, Tim. - Bob, I am your family. Here you go. One passport show-and-tell. I'll require your signature on these documents. These also require your star number. May I see it, please? Please fill in only those sections marked as required. This is a release form. Please read it. All these documents remain the property of the passport office... and are loaned to you only for the purposes as set forward in your application. - Third and Racine. - Your acceptance of them constitutes... - release of responsibility for this office- - 5:00 a.m. - Third and Racine. - until they are returned to our physical custody. Misuse or malfeasance in regard to this document is a federal crime. - I'm sorry. You can't smoke in here. Now - - I'll see you in the hall. We have the G22A - - Yeah, I'll file the form and see you tomorrow morning. - Okay. - Thanks a lot, Al. - Sure thing. You going up to the country this weekend? No, we're staying in town. I'll see you later. What are you gonna do? Write away to the manufacturer? - I rebel - -Jerry. Wait a second. I rebel every time somebody says to me - - Excuse me. - ''This is the thing of the future. '' If something works, why- I just saw the A.T.F. They were stolen, Sully. The tommy guns were stolen. All the guns on this invoice. Hey. You're better than an aquarium, you know that? - There's something happening with you every minute. - What does it mean? It don't mean nothing. Some broad got killed. She's dead now. Okay? You're going to the ticket office, pick up Randolph's tickets. - This is the big one, laddie. - Timmy, this other case. - Bob. - I got this piece ofpaper I found. ''Grofaz.'' ''Grofaz.'' What does it mean? I don't know what it means. I got this fella on the roof- the Jewish house. I - - What was he doing? Shooting at 'em? - I don't know. Well, then drop it, Bobby. For Christ's sake. I don't get it. - Maybe you don't want to get it. - What do you mean? - Nothin'. - What do you mean? 'Cause I ain't a Yid? - Well, you ain't a Yid. - And so what? I'm - I'm an anti-Semite? What the fuck are you sayin'? It's just not your thing, Tim. It's not your thing. It's my thing, okay? Bob, I'm gonna tell you what the old whore said, and this is the truest thing I know. ''When you start comin' with the customers, it's time to quit.'' - What is this? - That's the strap the guy tore off my holster. Well, go get it fixed, will ya? Go take a cooling walk- somethin'. - You mad at me? - Yeah, I'm mad at you. I'm not gonna invite you to my birthday party. - You dumb kike. Go get your holster fixed. - Excuse me. - We're closed. Well, I, uh, wonder, could you help me? - We're closed. We're closing up. - Well, I just need, um - I got a little problem. I'm a police officer. I lost the strap off my holster. - I can't help it. We're closing up. I'm sorry. You're a policeman? Yes. Show it to me. - What is it? - A word. A word? You know what the word means? Yes. I know what it means. It means ''Hitler.'' It was another name they had for Hitler. ''Grosster Feldherr Aller Zeiten. '' ''The greatest strategist... of all time.'' The Grofaz. Hitler. - Are you all right? - What? No, I, uh, just didn't get much sleep last night. You know, you have a very interesting request. The acronym is not well-known. It was used at the end of the war. The name is obviously the effort of their Propaganda Ministry. It was an interesting attempt, but it didn't particularly take. It was used by a group - the Sonderkommando. It was adopted by the Sonder Endlosung Kommando... of the division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. That is, the special group for the final solution... which is, of course, the extermination of the Jews. ''German people, follow the Grofaz.'' ''The Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler fights on all fronts for the salvation of Germany. TheJewish scourge can be cleansed only in blood.'' Uh, this is a very rare piece. What do you have on the use of this word? Currently. Particularly in conjunction with anti-Semitic acts. As I said, it's an arcane usage, but we'll look. We'll take a look. Ann? Current anti-Semitism under ''Grofaz,'' cross-reference ''Der Fuhrer.'' Bring it all. Yes. If you'd care to wait. I'm a police officer. The revolver disturbs you. The gun disturbs you. I'm a police officer. The gun doesn't disturb me. - You were looking at me. - The gun is nothing. The gun is a tool. We have nothing to fear from a tool. The badge concerns me. The badge, you see - The badge is a symbol. The badge is the symbol of that which constrains us. The star, you see -The star. The five-pointed star. The pentagram. It is identified as a star... but it is not the symbol of heaven. It is the symbol of Earth. The Magen David is the intersection of the opposites... and can be deconstructed into heaven and Earth. But the pentagram cannot be deconstructed. You see? The five points are the five senses. The Chinese five elements. The five fingers of the hand. You see? You're Jewish? Are you Jewish? - Yes. - Well - You see? From the book of Esther. Esther. From ''satan'' - ''to conceal. '' But what is concealed? What is concealed in the name Esther? And the answer is here. Here is the answer. Do you see? I can't read it. You say you're a Jew. I can't read it. You say you're a Jew, and you can't read Hebrew. What are you then? Would you get that book for me? Would you replace it for me, please? It goes up there. The material on anti-Semitic acts - Yes. I thought we had quite a file of current - It was requested by 212. - 212 wants it? - Yes. Loaned to 212 now? Fine. Then just pull the file. Okay. Thanks. The material on anti-Semitic acts. - No, we have nothing on that. - Nothing? - No. - This is official police business. Officer, you know I'd help you i-if I could, but as I said, it was rather arcane material. I'm sorry. Well, if there's nothing you can do, there's nothing you can do. Thank you. Not at all. If there's anything else I can help you with, let me know. We could put the couch on the other side. - Bookshelf would be nice, but I thought it would be - I, um - Can you tell me anything about this building? - What? - Do you know anything about this building? - I just, um - - About this building? - Yes. - Do you live around here? - Please, just tell me. Have you ever seen anyone go in or out - Get up against the fence. Up against the fence and grab it. Get up against the fence. Now grab the fence, or I will shoot you dead. What brings you out this evening, Mr. Gold? I want to know about the old woman. - We know nothing. - I think she was involved in running guns. - Running guns? - Long ago. - Why is that? - I-I found a list. A list of Jewish names. Men, here in this city. I think they were running guns with her. I - How did you get this address? What are you doing here? Why are you here? I need help. I want to know why she was killed. All right. This way, Mr. Gold. Please. Sit down. See that gun? I had one just like it. I gave mine to a kid in Hebron. Last year. Two years ago. They told me it was an affectation for me to still wear it. But you get used to it, you know. - Eh, Koli? - That's right. Ah. Would you like something to eat, Mr. Gold? - I'm going to have something to eat. - Barry, you want something? - Sure. Love to. - Shot the old lady. - I know. - Barry was with us in the old days. - That's right. - And Lev and Marv. What a time that was, Mr. Gold. What a woman she was. - I want to find the men who killed her. - Yes. And we need your help. - You have it. - Yes. She was running guns, wasn't she? Yes. During our war of independence. In our country, we call her a hero. Why would anyone want to kill her now? I don't know, but we must find out. So many of us... good Americans, who are good Jews... and good friends to Israel. - We always need such friends, you know. - Isn't that the truth? Yes. You, uh -You're such a man. - I? - You'd like to fight for your home. I would do anything. Now... we're going to find the killers. We're going to find them, and we're going to deal with them. You mentioned something about a list. Now, we need the list. No. No, no. The original. - It's at the precinct house. - Oh, good. Bring it with you when next you come. - Asher will fill you in - - I-I can't - Look. Excuse me. I can't bring the original. - No. The original is what we need. - That's what weneed. You see, it must be destroyed. She was killed. This man - These men - Good men in a city. You see, they're in danger. - But - - Yes? The list is evidence. I-I've logged it into an evidence bag. I - I've signed it in. Pl - Please. I -You know, anything. No. Not anything. I need the list. - Anything else. - Yes. Yes. Anything else. Of course. Anything else. Zahab. That's your name in Hebrew. Are you a Jew, Mr. Gold? - Yes. - Then be a Jew. You can't get the list. How long your resolution last? Until the first unpleasantness. - I'm a sworn police officer. - Where are your loyalties? You want a home. You want glory. You're willing to do nothing. - I took an oath. - Took an oath. He disgusts me. Get him out of here. Don't bother to return. The next time you come, there'll be nobody here. Yes? I need - I need to help. - In what way? - I want to help you, in your work. - I work for the airlines. - Please. Please, let me help - with whatever you do. What I do, Mr. Gold, you don't want to know. No, but I do. I need to - Please. Whatever you're doing - what you're doing tonight - let me help. Please. I'm begging you. Please. What can I tell ya about it? They said I was a pussy all my life. They said I was a pussy because I was a Jew. And the cops - They'd say, ''Send a Jew? Might as well send a broad on a job.'' ''Send a broad through the door.'' That's what they said. All my goddamn life. And I listened to it. Huh? I was the donkey. I was the clown. - You were the outsider. - Yes. - I understand. - They made me the hostage negotiator... 'cause I knew how the bad guys felt. Doing other people's work for them. - That's right. - In their country. - Yes, that's right. - And never working for yourself. - Yes. - I know. Now, why would I do that? You have your own home. Yes. I do. Now, what can that be like? To have your own country. I'm gone so much of the time. But I think about it. I know. I sat with those guys tonight. With... heroes. Jewish guys who had nothing to prove. And I - And I felt, Jesus, all my life... I gotta be the first one in the door. Huh? Not for me. All for someone else. Why? Because I'm no good. Because I'm nobody. I want to be a part of it. That's all. We think this leaflet was printed at that shop. The shop is owned by a Mr. Andersen, who's head of a group called the United Action Front... who we think may have had something to do with the murder of Mrs. Klein. And what were you sent here to do? To find out if the leaflet was printed there. - And if it was? - If it was, I'm going to give them a message. - I won't be long. - Let me do it for you. No, I can't do that. Wait. Give that back to me. Give it back. - I can't let you do it. - I'm going. How do I get in? I'm going. If I don't go, nobody's going. How do I get in? All right, then. - Can you use these lockpicks? - Yes. Can you use that? The bottom button, then the top. We went to that place. - Good. - I want to be a part of it. Good. Then you are a part of it. You've shown it. And now there's something we need from you. - Yes. - That list of names. We need the list. I told you. As a policeman, I can't. - We need it. - What he wants - give it to him. Please. I've explained it to him. I can't. It's evidence. Wh - Why do you want me to prove myself? Haven't I done that tonight? We don't want you to prove yourself. We want the list. No, I told you. The building you entered was under surveillance. Here are some photographs of you entering and leaving. Look at them at your leisure. We need the list. The facts here speak for themselves. You are nothing. Nothing. Oh, my God. I got a man hit. I need an ambulance right now! - Where were you? - What happened? What went down? Whole thing's gone bad. Sully here. Lieu, I can see the guy. Sullivan, pull out. Leave him there. Let the SWAT get him. You guys take cover! Get over close to the road! Take cover! Lieu, I got the uniform kid. He's hit bad. Okay. Bring him down. Bring him around. They got an ambulance coming in. Sullivan, Frank- you two guys get the hell out of there! - Sully's hit, Lieu. - Oh, God. Where are they? - Sully's hit bad. - Where is he? Where's Sullivan? - Stuck on the second floor. - Homicide. I'm on the corner of Fourth - - Where's Sullivan? - Yes, I see you. Don't come in. Stay out! Stay out! Tim, it's Bobby. Can you hear me? I'm going after Sullivan. Help! Oh, my God! - Someone get me out of here! - Oh, God! - Get me out! - Charlie, give me some cover. - You got it, Lieu. - You two guys, get your ass over here. - I'm hit! - Bobby, get to cover right now! - I'm going in after Sullivan! All units - Hey. Hey, can we get some help here? - Yo! - Where's the backup? Where is the backup? - Hey. Frankie, just hold up there. Just hold up there. - I gotta get some blood here. - We're working on it. Can we get some help here? Lieu. Lieu. Where's the ambulance? He shot the gun dry. I said, ''Now, don't be doing that. - You move around - - Bobby. - Hold on, Tim. You see, Bobby? Although, somebody told him to do that. - Now, who would do that, Bob? - Where's the medic? - Frankie, what does the lieu say? - Oh, God. - Hold on, Tim. - Can we get some help up here, Lieu? - You know what I'm talking about? - Yeah, yeah. That's right. - Frankie, what does the lieu say? - Do you know what I'm talking about? - Yes, I do. - But, finally... what difference does it make if you do or you don't? I swear to Christ, I don't know what they're talking about. If you're moved, somebody's doing it. Doesn't that have to be right, Bob? - Yes, it does. - Can we get some help up here, Lieu? - Bob. Bob. - Yes, Tim? - Bobby. You remember that girl that time, Bob? Tim? You shot my partner, you fucking nigger. I'm gonna kill you. - Who's got a walkie? - Get low. Get low. We need a stretcher in here. Came for me, motherfucker? - What you want me for? - I came here to kill you. Yeah, well, you forgot your gun, Jim. Where's your gun? That's death calling, baby- for you and for me. - Should I use you to bargain my way out of here? - You know they won't bargain for me. Yeah, that's so, ain't it? Well, then I guess I best help myself. You sorry fuckin' sack of shit. You shot my partner. Yeah, man, and you could have paid me back if you would've brought your gun. That was your mistake, man. - What's your name? - Gold. Robert Gold. Well, Mr. Gold, I'm just about on my way out of here. I got a moment. You want to tell me your last thought? - No. - You want to beg for your life? No. No? It's not worth anything. Well, ain't that a shame, huh? After all your trials, you come down to nothin'. Yeah. These motherfuckers got lucky. An hour ago, I would have been on a plane, long gone out of here. No. You weren't going anywhere. What the fuck you know, man? My mama had it all set up. The ticket, the passport. I would have been long gone out of here. But that's all right. Now I gotta do it the hard way. You know? - Yeah. I know it all. - Oh, you know, huh? You're one smart kike, ain't you, Mr. Gold? All you forgot is that, if you want to kill me... you best come armed. Randolph. Randolph. - Later, baby. - Your mother turned you in. You know she did it. - How else did we find you here? - You're a lying motherfucker, man. You don't know my mother. You ain't never seen my mother. I - Look at you, man. You're a piece of shit. That's right. I am a piece of shit. It's all a piece of shit. I killed my partner, and your mama turned you in. Don't die with a lie on your lips, man. You want your passport? I got it. It's a phony. All that shit, man- we made it up. Look at it. Your mama turned you over, man. Look at it! That's right. God. God help me. - What did you do to me? - Six to H.R.T. base. You're secure now. Base to Six. Copy. 12-15 standing down. And you can report landline. Base clean. - I'm all right. - Got an entrance wound. Upper-right chest area. - Keep the light on him. - I'm okay. Priority wound alert to shock trauma unit. - It's all in order. Good job. Thanks. - Do you want them now? - When you get back there. - Want me to send them downtown? - Let me look at 'em. - All right. You want to hear the rest of this or not? - Tell me later. - Okay. Get out of here. - Now don't go bossing me around. - I'm not bossing you. I'm begging you. - See you later. - See ya. When you get down on Fifth Street, you're going to see what I mean. - Who do I talk to down there? - When they gave up the shotgun - When they come in with the shotgun - - They- - Hey, Bob. - Hello. - Hi. I'm sorry about Sullivan. Yeah. We gotta roll. Yeah. Maybe I'll see you later. Have some coffee. See ya around, Bob. Yeah. All right. Now, what are you gonna bring me back? - I bring back the whole consignment. - And log it in. - Should I take a can? - Yeah. That way you get the shotgun, we log it... we match it for prints and ballistics. The shell is distinct. I'll get on that right away. That's exactly what I wanted to do. That's just the way it is. You took your shot, this is what happened. And if you're moved, somebody's gotta be doing it. Doesn't that have to be right? I want you to do the following thing. Log this stuff in, Frank, and then when you get downtown, you- We solved your case for you. Come on. I told you why we killed her, man - because she had that fortune in her basement. You're off Homicide. You're off. - Let's go. - We would have got it, too... - if that dog wouldn't have scared us off. - Get'em out of here. We've been holding this for ya.
