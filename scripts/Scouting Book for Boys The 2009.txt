As soon as it starts to get hot, people get so weird. The other day this guy came into Mum's shop and he goes to her, " don't have any money, but can have a lottery ticket? " Need a lottery ticket. " "Wednesday's a rollover and know that I'll win. " Mum goes, "I'll buy the ticket and if you win I'll give you half. " So they win, right? 50 quid! And Mum's claimed, right? Proper. But he ain't been round. Mum reckons he could be an angel. reckon that's just thick. He probably just had to go home. Just another fucker in a van. I'd have bought him it and laughed if his numbers come up. - Would you? - What? You think I'm lying? If he don't come back, I'll get one of you to dress up and claim. - Bet she don't remember what he's like. - I'd want a tenner of it if did. - I'd have given you 40. - All right, I'll have 30. - We made a deal. - Deals change. 'Hello, Steve? Come in, Steve. Yeah? He'd give away a ticket but he'd rip my Mum off. Yep. Aah. Oi! - You look like a cloud. - don't want to be a cloud. Ice-cream break? got money. Actually, that was... need to take you to your mum's. It's probably nothing, Ems. - How did she sound? - It's probably nothing. Let's just go, yeah? It's written all over your slapper face! Don't know why they chose him, sweetheart. Why would...? want you here with me. So have to move in with him because you're not good enough? - Was good enough. - You lost! That means that officially you're not! Tried my best. You little cow! Little cow? - You're the slag! - I'll talk to her. Could as well, if... I'm a good mother! Her dad won't look after her any better. You tell her she'll apologise to me. He's broken me in half, taking her. You can fuck off an' all. No, it's just... - When's she got to go? - Oh, fuck off, David! - You look like a penguin. - Yeah? Spoke to Dad this afternoon. - Yeah? - Swap. Said, if he wants me that much, why don't he come here to live? - Do you know what he said? - That he's got a job so he can't? "There's are great schools round here. You'd be happy. " "You could have David to stay whenever you liked. " Yeah? 'Unstoppable! Right, staff kids are barred. Come on, Betty. You know you love us. If you were paying, there would be no problem, but you are not, and so management will be after my ares. Off. Bitch. - Doesn't she count them for resale? - Do care? It'll be good for your tongue, this. Oi! Can't go. love it here. Yeah. Love it here. Know. It's just... You know the place you know, don't you? Get this place. was a kid in this place. Oh, they can't do this to me. It's not fair. You'll make friends. Loads of new mates and all that. Well, you're rubbish with new people. You won't make any new friends. I'll talk to Steve. Be a long conversation that. He don't like you much. - I'll be all right. - No, you won't! It's shit! It's shit for us both. And why? Because... Because of my... fucking mum! Was sure an alarm was going to go off. - Yeah. - Don't say yeah. Was being a spanner. She hasn't got an alarm. - She'll know someone's been in now. - You think? Can get you that mag now if you want. You're being a real wanker tonight. You're supposed to be my friend! Not... Captain Sensible! What? I'm not a captain. - You're not even upset I'm going. - 'Course am. Just fuck off, Captain, would you? - I'll fuck off, then. - No. I'm not a captain. Emily! Is Emily with you? All right, Steve? - Do you fancy a slide? - She's not here, is she? Is something wrong? - She didn't come home last night. - Who, Emily? Don't get jumpy. Probably kipped somewhere. But someone broke into the shop so Sharon thought Emily's nicked money and scarpered. - Oh, right. - Too right, right. Come on, kiddo. I'm taking you to Sharon's. Come on, David. She's worried. - Get on the back. - What? On the back. On the back! Fucking wonder about you sometimes. Was just calling to see if she was with you. Yeah. Right. OK. OK. She weren't with David? Took some finding him an' all. She's not round the park. Right. She's just trying to piss you off. She'll be back tomorrow. - Just got to put it out of your mind. - Yeah. Could do some phoning. For the people who might lie to you. No, love. Steve's right. She's just angry with me, isn't she? Don't take Mystic Meg to work that one out. No. cashed up last night, though. Almost wish hadn't. - What's she going to do without cash? - She wouldn't take your money. No, she'll be back. Yee-ha! Ladies and gentlemen, rattle your bedpans and shake your knickers - ... for the fantastical... - Here to see your old dad? - No. - Oh? Ladies and gentlemen... - Have you found her? - No. So you're looking here? I've not seen her about. ...Am a deeply loving man. No, just... just wanted to talk to you. She'll stay away two nights and come back, thinking she's got us good. She'd think one night weren't trying hard enough. Silly cow's just doing it for attention. Come on, Davey. Come up on stage and join your old dad. - Come on. - Up you go, kiddo. We were just... wanted to hang outwith you. - And do what? - Have a beer. David! David! David! David! - She'll be back, OK? - We haven't got all night! Hurry, lad. Get up there. Put your hands together and show a bit of appreciation for my lovely son. You ladies be careful with him. They don't call him Billy the Point for nothing. He'll have your eye out. Hit it, Joe. Love my son, ladies and gentlemen. Since his mum died, he's given me all need, a cuddle every night of the week and a smooch at the weekend. This one's for you, kid. Used to wake up with you In my arms Your sweet lips Give me all that need Look to your daddy, baby. Your skin's so lovely to me Come lie down close next to me Davey Let me love you... OK, that's the provisional report on the system. We'll file officially in... 14 hours. Is that a posh way of saying you won't do it now? We don't file till 48 hours, Sharon. You know that. Besides, she'll probably be home before you are. - Couple of hours, tops. - She's been gone two nights. And this one, he never leaves her side. Nine times out of ten, ten times out of ten, this is just a runaway. Will you tell her know my own daughter? Not this long. OK? Not this long. - Is there owt we can do? - We could make posters, cheap ones. - Nothing so specific yet. - Will you shut the fuck up? - Swearing at me won't help. OK, love? - Oh, red rag day, is it? You're supposed to be a professional. - Come on. Let's go. - Don't hold me. - We can make posters, Sharon. OK? - Yeah, OK. - David? - What? I'm OK. She was a bitch right enough. - Is it a school photo? - Yeah, about six months ago. Oh, right. She looks just like you in it. You reckon Maureen'll run a few of these off on the photocopier? Sure. Do you want me to run you round? - Oh, yeah. Would you? - Yeah. Lock up, David. - Good catch. - OK. Come on, Steven. "Rocks And Daggers" # Oh, the rocks # They will always hold in the sea # And erosion can't stop their being # Oh, no, currents can't defeat them # And am thankful for the love # These rocks have always given # And although this boat is steady now # One wave can pull me under # And I'll be stranded out at sea # And will pray that those rocks # Will be there for me # And will pray that those rocks Will be there for me... No one followed you? Cos you're early. - No. - We said two days. - It's barely been a day and a half. - Almost two. - We did it. We fucking did it! - know we did. Are these presents? - For me? - Yeah. Mmm. Just what always wanted. Champions! - That is such a gay word. - Yeah. Fuck it! Don't it get cold at night? Cold's cold. don't give a shit. We could make this place better. We could actually make it really nice. - It's a cave, David. - Yeah, but... Did you buy this from Mum's shop? - Nicked it, yeah. - Nicked it? Did you? Nice one, Davido. Was counting the hours till you got here, you know. That's how knew you were early. - Couldn't wait to see you. - Couldn't wait to see you, either. That makes us snap which makes us better. - Yeah, better. - Too right! Ow! - Did she have a fella? - Who? - Did she have a fella? - What? Sharon. Look, think it's sleep time, love. Someone saw her with someone, kissing her. - Oh. - They saw her picture on the poster. - Did she have a fella? - Come on, Sharon, work nights! You couldn't work nights if they bit you on the ares! - Did she have a fella, David? - No. She didn't. Liar! ain't going to ask you again. Did she have one? My head feels like a sack of fucking balls. Good night. No. You'll need to change the number if you want to keep using it. Taking it seriously now, aren't you? Two witnesses. - People confirmed it. Two. - This David, is it? David, I'm Detective Inspector Kertzer, and I'd love to... chat. Asked him. - He knows nothing about some fella. - OK, David. Five minutes? Nothing serious. Yeah, OK. Coke? Tea? As many sugars as you like. Just a memory aid, OK? OK. Now, what I'm trying to do David, is get as clear a picture of Emily as can get, like a portrait of... OK. So... You and Emily. Very close I've heard, squeakily close. - Yeah. - You'd know if she had a boyfriend. - Yeah. She didn't. - OK. So this is crucial. Even if she left of her own volition, it's still abduction if she went with an older man. - Do you understand that? - Yeah. David, I've got witnesses that have seen Emily getting... intimate with an older man at Sands nightclub. - The barman confirmed it. - She didn't have no one. - She tell you where she's gone, David? - No. Can you think where she might have? Tried, but... couldn't think of anywhere. OK, smashing. Thanks very much. That's everything. I'm sure it's nothing serious, David. OK? She's probably just run off to the city. Anyway, we're going to up things our end. If you do think of where she might have gone... OK. Oh, just one more thing. You two were friends with the security guard? Steve? Yeah. That's great, David. Thank you. Right, off you go. The secret will be to think like them. What? Think like sheep? Sheepdogs think like sheep. That's basically their secret. Sheepdogs think like sheepdogs. You want to think like a sheepdog, you think like a sheepdog. But me, I'm gonna think like a sheep. You can stop looking at me like a sheepdog for a start. No. just... You ready? To be a sheep? You bet. Three... two... one... go! Go that way. Get that one. That one on the end. Get it! Get it! Get down. Get down! - Shoo! - Get down. There's someone coming. - Chasing sheep? - No. Thought saw you chase a sheep. No, was just mucking around. Keep at it. You knob end. "Just mucking about"? Knob. He didn't see anything. - David, he didn't see anything. - Maybe. just... Watch out. Watch out! - Emily. - What? There's a hole in the floor here. You can see the cave. Here. You can see your sleeping bag. No, it's not. You can't see shit. Come down here. You can see it clearly there. - You can't see anything. - We've got to get that covered up. Can you see it? Tell me. - What's got your knickers in an itch? - They're not in an itch. Know you, David. What's going on? Mum's slitting her wrists, is she? Well, everyone's looking a bit, suppose. Steve got his walkie-talkie and his gun out, has he? They won't find you. Could just imagine him sheep-hustling. They won't. Tell you what, could just do with a bit of fresh sheep about now? Which doesn't mean we're trying that again. David, even if this does go wrong, you won't get in any trouble. It won't, though. Just got to be a bit more careful. Yeah, know. You've got really warm hands. Do you know that? They're well warm. Hmm. The wood warms hands up. Mmm. - Won't let you down. - You never have yet. Warm makes me tired. Like it when you're here. About 62 hours ago a young girl, Emily Walton, went missing. We currently believe that she's been abducted. Unfortunately, Sharon, Emily's mother, has been taken ill, and so David, a good friend of Emily's, has stepped in to make a personal appeal. If anyone sees Emily about or finds out anything, could they report it to the number? Cos she's my friend and want her back. We need your help. Any questions? Have you got anyone in custody? Yes, we have been interviewing a suspect, but let's not make any guilty assumptions yet. Rather, do our very best to find this girl. Frank? Maybe you could tell us a bit more about Emily. How long have you known her? About six years. Both of our parents work up on the site and... because we're the same age and there aren't many more kids around permanent, we just sort of fell in... And now... now we just try and spend all our time together. - OK, we'll leave it there. - don't have a sister and... she ain't got a brother and... She's sort of like my sister and I'm sort of like her brother, and... because we chose each other, because we're chosen brother and sister, that makes us better than sisters and brothers. For me... she makes everything better. Just want her back. OK. 016329608555. Thank you. Tried to... tried to get in to... see Steve, - Let's. Can we just get you to your... - That's the door. To see him, you know, in his cell. Do you want to know something? always fancied him. Fancied him. And him and my daughter... Don't that make you sick? Sick? - And ain't... - Sorry... Aah. Oh, now... Oh, no, let's lie here for a bit. Sorry. Just want him to tell me where she is. Just want my daughter back. And know that I'm not the best mum in the world. But just want her back. - Hello, Patrick! - Hello, Sharon. David, do you remember Emily's dad? You know, James Bond, the cunt who shagged me. Hello, David. Hi. "If Die Tonight" # If died and left a broken soul # It would leave a hole in your heart # If died and left you with no one # Would you stare at the sun # And think of me # wrote a million love songs for you # And every one of them says love you # And meant it from the heart Every one of those words was true... What would do without you? I'll sing, what would do without you? What would do without you? I'll sing, what would do without you? I'd be lost... - What? - Nothing. - What? - Nothing. Can say nothing, too. Think we could do this, you know? Me and you. Me bringing you stuff. - We could actually do it. - OK. Don't have a wank about it! No. I'm just saying that I've had a good day today, that's all. Your dad's back. just thought you should know. He's here for the... - He said much? - Not to me. - He always liked you. - Yeah? - He was right. - What? To like you. He was right to like you. Like you. That's all I'm saying. I'm just... Thanks, for all this. Yeah. - Are you cold? - No. Yeah, you are. I'm not. I'm being a fish tonight, aren't? Been stuck in that fucking cave all day. - Anyway, love fishing. - But you are cold. I'm not. Bin bags? Great. Are you going to do a litter-pick? No,... got you this book. - Says in here... - need food. Clothes. Jumpers and stuff to keep me warm and shampoo to do my hair. Fucking bin bags? Go on, get in. The bag heats your body up. It'll keep you nice. Nice? You try living in a cave, Jungle Jim, and I'll go and live with your dad. Fuck me, am getting warmer! What? Can feel my bones coming back from deep-frost setting. There's a pillow you can make from heather and moss. Grass is rubbish. It flattens down too quick. - Wool's good, too. - We're not chasing another sheep. Too right. Look at you, all excited. Blue Peter boy you, aren't you? David! - I'm sorry. - What was that? Just, with you being warm and... Sorry. You're the one trust. Can't start tonguing you. Where are you going now? Stop! Know. About Steve. Oh. - Don't boo, OK? - I'm not booing. - You look like you are. - Well, I'm not. How did you find out? Why does that matter? Why didn't you just tell me? Well, no, cos... Steve was being a pussy. He said couldn't. Did he tell you? Is he upset? Yeah. Well, I'm pleased you know now, anyway. - Yeah? - Yeah. Cos I'm... I'm pregnant. - What? - Yeah, know. Just... got to get to 24 weeks, OK? It's the law. Can't have an abortion after that, can't... suck it, cut it, whatever they do, out. Can't make me. Why else do you think I'm here? Just 53 more days stuck in this shit pit and then I'm free. We can do it. Can't we? Dad would force me to have an abortion. He'd notice well quick. Mum never would. And he's taking me away from Steve and... All got to do is sit tight. I'll be a good mother, don't you think? Are you leaving? You can't. When someone tells you something big, you've got to make them feel better. David, it's the rules. Oh! - Where is she? - don't know. - Tell me where she fucking is! - If knew, I'd tell you. - If you're lying... - I'm not. - If you're lying... - I'm not! - Have you escaped? - Fuck no. They let me go. They got no reason to keep me on a... got this refused charge letter bollocks thing. Shit! Shit! - Are you sure you don't know? - Yeah. No. don't know. Think I'm being followed. Rather the police than Sharon. She's going to chop my bollocks off. Got any biscuits? So what are we going to do now? I'll go west, up the farms. You could live in a grain store for a month and no one... And you go down the coast. Beach huts, caves. The whole deal. Right? Yeah. I'm gone. Look hard, kid, OK? These monkeys will never find her. It's up to us. Steve? How come you think don't think that you've done it? Cos you ain't thick. You and her. Together, mean. It was just a kiss in the car park. Both a bit pissed, that's all. Like a kid sister or something. OK. Listen, if we get this sorted, all three of us'll go for a beer. OK? Right. I'm gone. If find out you lied, will break your fucking legs. - You're back. - Yeah. Thought you might not. - Do you want me to say sorry? - No. Well, if don't say sorry, then you do. Scaring me like that. - Putting the... - know. Sorry. - It's not a game, David. - Yeah, I'm sorry. It's fucking cold, I've got no food, no clothes, and you make me think you're not coming back. - It's not fair. - I'm sorry. Tried leaving. Walked up the beach. Was thinking about going and... this family come and spread out a mat and they had... sandwiches. Hid from them. Hid in the rocks from them, afraid to let them see me. - How pussy is that? - No, it's not pussy. You're doing it for your kid, aren't you? - Too right am. - thought that... When it's... could be like an uncle or something. Yeah. Uncle David. Definitely! And when I'm having it, want you waiting outside. Steve will be inside, doing the breathing with me and when it's born, I'll be like, "Get David in to meet his nephew. " - Did you bring me some food? - did better than that. Oh, my God! Some of this is really nice stuff. - How did you get it? - How do you think? Nicked it. "2 Atoms In A Molecule" This is really nice stuff! This is like the best thing ever. # Last night had a dream # we were inseparably entwined # Like a piece of rope # made out of two pieces of vine # Held together holding each other # with no one else in mind # Like two atoms in a molecule # inseparably combined # If love is just a game # Then how come it's no fun? # If love is just a game # How come I've never won? # Guess maybe it's possible # might be playing it wrong That's why every time roll the dice always come undone... Did you get much? Oh, that's clever. like that. - Could stay. - What? You've got clothes to last you now. Can find the food. It's shit out there without you. - Could stay. - No. Maybe later but for now you can't. want you to give Steve this. What? Oh. You're not telling him where we are? If give him this, he'll know... What does it matter if he does? He can keep secrets. - No, he can't. - need him to know I'm OK. He must be worried wild. Just... give him that and get a reply back, OK? - Simple. - OK. - Promise? - Promise. Thanks. You'll get plenty of other girls. You know that, don't you? You're quite good-looking when you brush your hair. Dance with me. Show me your moves. - I'll get you in training. - No. Put your arms round my waist. We'll do proper dancing. Oh, hello! Someone's got a stiff y and it ain't me! - No. - You have. Ow, dickhead! - I've cut myself. - didn't have a... What does it matter? There's ego points for me in stiffies. If this scars, I'll kill you. My legs are my best feature. My skirt's ruined. At least you got me clothes for Christmas. Right, let's eat. Snap ready, would you? We're eating. Aah, that's boiling. Burnt my finger. We'll wait for it to cool down, yeah? Know you're guilty. Open the fucking door. Can wait all fucking night. Steve? Steve? Know you're in there, you fucking bastard. Open the door. Eighteen more. - Steve! - Shit. Shit! That guy, Steve, got away, then? Saw him just now with that Emily on his bike. You couldn't even get that right. - Are you not going to get that? - No. No luck finding her then? They got all emotional about serving me so just drank out here instead. OK. Said some dumb stuff the night she left. She said dumber, but... You know Ems. She thinks she's all grown up. But she ain't. Not in the way she thinks she is or... wish hadn't said dumb... Oh, she would love that. You should put me on tape, me saying that. She would laugh at that. Love her laugh. Miss her, you know. Feel like a fucking dog shit, without a dog. - I'd better go. - David. You just keep looking now, OK? You just keep looking. You bastard! Where is she? He's got our daughter, Patrick! Our daughter. Know... You're getting your trousers wet. You're that girl's mate, right? - The missing one. - No. Aren't you? You look his spitting image. Must have one of those faces. Yeah, must. - Well, hope they find her. - Just down here on holiday. Us too, aren't we, Daisy? Aren't we? - Do you want to hold her? - No. - She likes strangers. - I'm OK. - I'll make sure you don't drop her. - No, I'm all right. Never mind. Shall we go for a swim? We need you now. Press conference. She's hurt but she is alive. - What? - Found a scrap of material. Blood. On his bike. And we age-matched it. It is less than 12 hours old. knew it. knew it! We're going to step up the search. We're going to find her, Davey. Anyone free, any holiday-makers, any residents, we need your help now. This is now a matter of finding a child in danger. Don't think need David here to tell you what this case means. This is a chance, a real chance to make a difference in our community, to save a child. Take the bag, seal the top. Radio Norfolk. A few words about the missing girl? Very encouraging. Great finds. And it's only been hours, not days. You can't see anything? No? The neighboring force is sending some troops. Extra constables and some advisers for... For me. That was quite a surprise, that phone call. And... we're going to stretch the search, down the coastline, up to the farms around Harrelswick, if the advisers agree to it. We're going to find her, David. What was that? Ohh! Who did this? Whoever did this...? Oh, he weren't inside. But if he was, who cares? No, no, no, no. This van... This is not the way we do things. Steve knows. Steve fucking knows. And he needs to know that we'll do anything to find her. Take a picture of his burning shithole, and let the fucker know we mean business. Right, arrest her. What? Fuck off! Fuck off! Am arresting you on suspicion of causing criminal damage and arson. You arrest me? You couldn't arrest a fucking chicken! Ow! Know what you could do? Shave off that stupid fucking mustache! - You can't light fires now, OK? - When can? Don't think ever. What? Are you going to get me a heater? Just stay in your bag. That's warm. - I'm not a fucking bag lady. - We just need to be more careful. - Did you get his note? - What? Steve. - You gave him my letter, right? - Yeah. - So where's his note back? - Um, he didn't... He... gave you this. - He gave you this? - He said that was better than a note. Said he wants you to wear it, to make you proper, you know - It's a bit cheap, even for him. - Is it? Did he try and get it out you? Where we were? No, he was OK. He got WW... - You didn't tell him. - 'Course did. David, I've known you too long. And him. He didn't buy this cheap shit for me. He... He did. You fibbing little fuck. What? You want to keep me for yourself? No. You're... Shit. You do, don't you? - He got you a ring. - You can't keep me here, you know. - Don't want to be by myself any more. - You're not, you've got me. You don't count! Want a letter from him David, OK? Otherwise I'm leaving and I'm taking my chances. Count. do. count. I'm a woman. I'm having a baby. need a man to take care of me. - I'm a man. - Don't be daft! OK. OK what? - I'll bring him here, tell him everything.
