Can this rotten government stop the Japanese? You've lost your senses! We warned you, Jung Yeo-rip. Disband the alliance. Let's go. The West Cabinet will do anything to win the king's favor. They can frame you for treason. And who will have to suffer? Our East Cabinet. l am no part of the East or West. Don't drag us into your rotten power games. Naive man. Let's go. Yeo-rip! You did good. That'll teach them. Let's just stop the Japanese! Stopping the Japanese won't free us from their schemes. Sir. Let us strike them first. What's that? ls this talk of a revolt l hear? We can't accomplish anything if we're killed! Hey! Watch that tongue, Mong-hak. - What? - Stop! Yeo-rip, keep a close eye on this one. Peace lies at the end of a long and harsh path. BLADES OF BLOOD Hwang Jung-min Cha Seung-won Jung Yeo-rip has been Han Ji-hye charged with high treason. Baek Sung-hyun As creator of the Grand Alliance, Jung took his own life once his plot was detected. For such an unforgivable crime, he is punished further. His children and accomplices His property is confiscated. will be punished by law. A film by Lee Joon-ik l told you to watch your tongue. Tear up his body and hang it across the land as an example to others. Yes, Your Highness. They can't even save their own heads. The Grand Alliance is a joke! lt's always all talk and no real result. Did Jung really kill himself? lt was Han Shin-kyun! lt's all his scheme. Han Shin-kyun, that bastard. They're kicking out the East Cabinet to keep the palace under their control. Watch it, you idiots. lsn't that Han's bastard son? The bastard son defending his bastard of a father. Bastard? You heard me. You crazy bastard! Stop right now! Someone stop him! l'll get you! Go and stop him! Get him off! Stop! Let him go! Your family sure is powerful. How many times is it? Just go home. l hit Confucian scholars. l deserve punishment. l'm not leaving. The memorial service is today. Let's go. Make way for Lord SONG. Step aside! How dare you raise your sword! Lee Mong-hak, you imbecile! Jung Yeo-rip was a traitor! ln my eyes, You're the traitors bringing the country to ruin. lmbecile! Let go. Behave yourself! l'll go away after pouring a glass. Put it down! l'm Han Kyun-ju! of the Han household! - Drag him away! - Get him! Let go of me! Father! Father! Deny me, then! All the Hans are here! Deny me now! Then l won't come! Father! Tell them l'm not your son! Father! Who are you? Where are you going? You can't go this way! Go get him! Bring me Jung's head! - Who are you? - Sheesh! lt's been ages since l had a drink. You can have one drink over there. Where? You parasite! You've disgraced to the entire household! Just kill me, then! Stop it. A concubine's bastard child dares to honor our ancestors? ls that what Confucius preaches? ls it written anywhere? Who the hell says l can't! What makes you so damn superior? Leave me alone. Leave me alone! ls pouring a glass that important? lt's because, l'm a concubine's son. Kyun-ju! Do you know what people call me? Han Kyun-ju. No one knows that name. l'm just the bastard. A mutt! lf you listen to them, you are a mutt. Coward. Our king is a concubine's son. Without dreams, you're only a mutt. What brings you here, Hwang? Jang-gak? l thought you'd be here. You will pay for the death of Jung Yeo-rip. The Grand Alliance will have justice! ls the East Cabinet behind this? l am neither East nor West. Father! Father! Mong-hak! Good riddance. Since when was the alliance yours? The alliance will now take the greater path. Greater path, my ass! Who killed Jung Yeo-rip? You already know. Where were you when he hung himself? Huh? Did he really kill himself? Don't show yourself again. Or l will have to kill you. Lee Mong-hak! Hey! Stop right there! Lee Mong-hak! Where'd he go? Stop! Your Highness, the Chinese empire must know Japan will pass through Chosun to strike China. No, Your Highness. The emperor will question us if war does not happen. Let him question us! The nation is in danger! The Japanese have intruded many times before. And if the war does happen? There will be a war? No, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness! Lord Yoo, the Japanese aren't coming? They are. Then why are you saying otherwise? They claim they will, so we must deny it. Lord Jung, let's move on to the Lee Mong-hak issue. We've said war is upon us. lt's enough bad news for His Highness. l forgot how hard it was to save a dying fool. A little lime powder... Goodness. There. All done. Let's see. Goodness. Goodness gracious. He's alive! l thought you were long gone. lf he stabbed you one inch to the side, you'd be off with your father by now. Who are you? Just a blind man. Let's see. One last prick! Goodness. lt went too deep. We can't attack the district hall. Thats the only way the people will support us! They already do, So even the king can't kill us. That's why we must strike first. Or we'll all be dead. Foolish man. We formed the alliance to fight the Japanese, not the king! Can we stop them with such a rotten government? That's why we've gathered to save the country! And after that? You think they'll let us live? You saw how Jung was made a traitor and killed! Then what? You want to start a revolt? Are you with us, or not? You? l'm with you. ldiot. Your father's dead, but it still tastes good, eh? Well, now. Had enough, eh? Why did you rescue me? Well... Jung was my friend. Thanks to your father and Mong-hak, lt's all gotten so complicated. You want to kill Mong-hak? l need to kill him, too. Put it over there! Rice and supplies. lt's all here. Any movement in the palace? They're busy dealing with the Japanese. While the East and West are bickering in Seoul, We should strike the Yong-in district hall. Yeo-rip... l'm sorry. Rest in peace. You little mutt! Where are you going? Wait here. Going alone to catch him? Good luck with that wound! Mong-hak is mine and you're my guide dog! Don't step foot in this house again. l'm going after Lee Mong-hak. Lee Mong-hak is mine. That's why you hid under the floor? Just stick to honoring ancestors. They say... Everyone mourns when a lord's dog dies, but nobody mourns when the lord dies. Old sayings are never wrong. Don't glare at me. Lead the way! Hold this. l can smell anything but l'm blind as a bat. Keep your eyes open! You've followed us long enough. Who are you? Where's Mong-hak? Well. Why are you asking me? lt's three thousand for his head. From who? None of your business. Goodness. Then why point your sword at me? l know you talked to Mong-hak at Han Shin-kyun's house. Smoke always rises up from a fire. You're going after Mong-hak. Tell me. Goodness. Why would l give up three thousand coins, you idiot? What are you doing? Please, stop! Draw your sword! This isn't the time or place! Go home and slice bread with that. Everyone's after Mong-hak. Have you lost your mind? Teach me how to fight! You die younger with a sword, you idiot! What's that sound? l'm on my knees. So what? At least let me die when l want to! Let go! Teach me. Teach me! Get off, you mutt! - Let go of me! - Teach me! Let go, you little bastard. Lead the way! - What was that for? - You just died, idiot! Goddamn... Goddamn? You want to hit me? Goddamn it. Go on and hit me! lf you weren't blind... Lead the way, mutt. Damn it. Which way? ls it a crossroad? Left is Lee Mong-hak, right is a nice drink. Which way did it go? l think it's the right. Hey! Why are you going left? Where are you going? We're going after Lee Mong-hak! Did you just spit at me? Let go! - No! - Let go! Give it back. Give it to me! No, l won't! You little bastard! Huh? Let you die when you want? You just died again. Give it here. Where's the hole? A little dog is leading the way. Purebred or not, l do not know. But a bastard nonetheless. l'm not a bastard! l have a name, too! Han Kyun-ju. Where is everyone? lt's me! l'm here! Look who's here. Girls! Girls! Hwang is here! Should we get ready? Of course. Bring them all. All at once! Why were you gone so long? l was busy. We've missed you, Hwang. You promised to come often. You're too healthy to join in. That crook... lt hurts. Don't whine. Nothing could hurt you girls. l think we're done. You're sweating. Hey. What's wrong with Baek-ji? Her lover ran away. Cho-hyang, l'm parched. Tell Baek-ji to come, too. Always with that Baek-ji. What are you doing? Hurry and grab these! Baek-ji is Mong-hak's girl. By the sound of that poor song, looks like you're wasting away inside. Should l treat you down there? Who's this? lt's dark out, yet where are all the customers? Lee Mong-hak and his sword scared them all away. Didn't you hear? He killed all the men over at Lord Han's house. He did? - But l still like Lee. - What? He's handsome and what a swordsman! l'm Han Shin-kyun's bastard son. So what? Where is Lee Mong-hak? l didn't treat you, Cho-hyang. My goodness! Your lower body is so cold. l'll warm you up with my needles. Just take out that big old needle. But l didn't wash yet... Have a drink. No room for a drink? Lee Mong-hak. Where is he? Tell me! Here. Right here! Cho-hyang. When did Mong-hak come to see Baek-ji? Hasn't been here for ages. Will you... Kill him for me? Can you? ldiot! Go on. You can't, can you? - Working hard, my friends. - Had supper yet? - We did. - Hope you enjoyed it. Wonder what the governor is up to? - Must be sleeping. - At a time like this? What's all the noise? Who are you? Where have our manners gone? Excuse us! Governor, wake up. Who is it? Shouldn't you take a look? You go. Can you sleep at a time like this? Who are you? Free the prisoners and open storage. Grand Alliance! Grand Alliance! How could you let Lee Mong-hak attack a district hall? The governor he killed was one of ours. Our East Cabinet will destroy the alliance. What? He killed a West Cabinet member first! You're taking sides in the middle of a revolt? Baron. Take charge and bring me Lee Mong-hak! Yes, Your Highness. Hwang. Leaving already? To see the metalsmith at An-sung. How convenient! Take our chamber pots to him, will you? Chamber pots? Those relentless nobles have already rusted our pots. l'm a bastard. So? My mother was a gisaeng, too. Did anyone ask? Go straight to An-sung. Don't sell them off. Crazy girl. Who'd buy your dirty chamber pots? Were you up all night? She's one persistent girl. Oh my! Should l carry that? My back... What a healthy girl! Where's Lee Mong-hak? Where's Lee Mong-hak? Where is he?! You idiot! Stop hitting me! Did you expect her to lead you the way? You blocked me? Stop it! ldiot. Pick them up! Damn it. Outrageous! Jumping at her with your pants off like that! Let's settle this! One night with a gisaeng, and your mind is clouded. Look who's talking! The moon shines for me, at least. Don't talk back! Hips up! Strike fast! Point your sword! Turn! Strike! You idiot. Lower your body. Dodge this! Go ahead. He's lost his mind. Where am l? You're hiding now? Come here, old man! You're hopeless. Just learn acupuncture. What for? Fool. Needles turn into food, drinks, and even sex. By royal decree, The district hall of Yong-in ls now the prison of Lee Mong-hak and the Grand Alliance. Pyeong-taek, Yong-in, Osan, and Cheong-ju. We will ransack all the nearby districts to catch Lee and his accomplices. - ls that clear? - Yes, sir! Han Pil-ju is arresting our comrades. He got LlM Chul-min. Your terms? You will be spared. The metalsmith's weapons? They're ready, sir. Hurry to An-sung and bring the weapons. Keep your eyes open. What? What did l just say, idiot? You sure you're blind? Open your eyes! Metalsmith! l brought you the girls' chamber pots. They want bowls made from those? What goes in comes out and just goes on! Right you are! Who's this? My mutt. Welcome! Might as well learn the craft. Metalwork is quite a gift. Just knock a few times, and you get food, drinks, - or even... - Sex? There you go. You just have to knock. Go sharpen this. l need a word with you. l hear Mong-hak hit the district hall. He's just trying to save the country. Save the country? When did it need saving? We formed the alliance to stop the Japanese, Not to go robbing the country! Can we stop the Japanese with this rotten regime? You're on Mong-hak's side. He's on my side, and you're on my side. l knew from the moment Mong-hak joined the alliance. What? He's using the alliance to become king himself! Could happen, l suppose? Where's Mong-hak? l don't know. l'm blind too, sometimes. Don't ask me. That weasel. Give it a rest. Don't you ever sleep? How can you sleep? What about Lee Mong-hak? All right. Fine. Let's go. Let's get him. But where? Where is he? Lead the way! You don't know either! We can't sleep! Blind idiot! Are you blind? The sword is only a tool. lt' all about using your eyes! Your sword works fine without your eyes. l use my ears instead! Damn it! Now you're getting the hang of it. You crazy old man! Don't run away! Coward! Come back here. You're mine! Where are you going? You hear that? lt's hammers. But it should sound like brass, not cast iron. Hey. lf we wait here, Mong-hak will come. Leave this place. l can go with you. No. Don't. l'm scared. You might die if you stay. The sun's been up for ages. Get up, you blind bat. A blind man can't know if the sun is up. You lazy fool. l haven't got time to melt the pots. Just tell them l did. What are you staring at? Go on, now. Damn it. What are we getting out of it? l'm just so busy right now. l'll buy you a drink next time. Here's something for the road. Metalsmith. Knocking isn't always the solution. Hwang. Stop taking the long way. Join us on the greater path. l like the long way. Don't go anywhere. lf you're gone, l'll kill you myself. Little mutt. Grown fond of me? Keep your hands off Lee Mong-hak. All right. Hurry back. - ls the date set? - Yes. Tell Mong-hak to be patient and calm. l will. Ready? Let's go. Well, hello! l knew you'd show up here! Hwang! Why are you back? Hey, Mong-hak! Step aside, Hwang. Goodness. ls that you, Bong-seok? You step aside! You fool. Mong-hak isn't here. Don't play tricks on me. ldiot! No need for that! They got to you too? lt's out of your hands now. Come here. - Let go! - Come here! - Mong-hak is here! - No, he isn't! - He is! - Are you deaf, too? l smell him! This way, you fool! Get them all! The bowls are here! Oh my! Already? Where's Hwang? He didn't come. l have to go. Find her! Get out here. Bind her. Let go of me. Let go! Filthy bitch! Stop! What are you doing? Ask Lee Mong-hak. Stop it! You part of the alliance, too? You haven't even grown a beard yet. You little imbecile. l said, stop! You want to die? You little bastard! How dare you... You attacked an officer? Run away. Go! Run! There you are. Why do l smell blood and perfume? Fifteen thousand Japanese invaded Busan, you idiots! Lord Yoo, you said they weren't coming! l was trying to keep the public calm then. Now they're in panic. Do something! - We'll stop them. - With what? You lobbied against building up the military! Lord Yoo. How many men can we mobilize? How many? Don't ask me. Your Highness! Do not listen to the East Cabinet! Then what? Send General KWON on land... And Admiral Lee on sea. Preposterous! General SHlN on land... And Admiral WON on sea! General SHlN on land. Your Highness! Admiral Lee on sea. Your Highness! When will the Japanese get to Seoul? ln a month. What's stopping them? lt'll be two weeks! Mong-hak, we must hurry. Hurrying isn't the answer! You think this regime can stop the Japanese? We must strike first in order to stop them! Tomorrow, we save our comrades and ride into Seoul. Grand Alliance! Mong-hak is your enemy. She's Mong-hak's girl. But you and her... Make your father proud, eh? Leave it be. You need to keep things simple, fool. What is this? You see that? What? Turn around. See your messy trail? That's your clouded mind. Faulty footsteps will kill a swordsman. Why does this matter? l'll erase them. Weren't we going after Lee? Where do we go? The whole alliance is being arrested at Yong-in. Where else would he be? Wait up! Leave her behind. Why? lt's a heavy load for the long road! Just look at Mong-hak! Don't follow us. l'm not following you. l'm going to Lee Mong-hak. Go. No. Go away! Lead the way. Don't follow me! Then kill me first. Why didn't you go with Hwang? Lee is worth more than your own life? l'll find him and kill him. You're no match for him. Why not? You have no dream. Yeo-rip. The worId has gone mad. Grand AIIiance... Does the worId we dreamed of even exist? Execute them all! Pull! Grand Alliance! You traitor! Yes, l'm the traitor. Out of the way! ldiots! Just a filthy pack of dogs! Mong-hak! Mong-hak! Goodness. Why's it so hard to find you? l told you not to show yourself. You did. But l just really wanted to ask you something. You killed Yeo-rip, didn't you? Yes. Slaying your master and pacifying your greed is the greater path? Why did we form the alliance? To avoid power games and keep out the Japanese. - That's right. - And yet! We stopped them, but the West makes us traitors. The East Cabinet looks away to save themselves. So? l told Jung Yeo-rip, Rather than dying as traitors, We should wipe them all out. But he just couldn't do it. l killed Jung to uphold our vision. Nothing but fancy words! You only used the alliance to become king! True. ln my eyes... East, West, the king, and Jung are all the same. And you! ls that so? Then fight! Let's see if your sword is as slick as your tongue. A swordsman should stand behind his sword. Or else, he ends up like you. Never liked hiding behind a sword. Mong-hak... Mong-hak. Don't go to Seoul. The dream we all shared... lsn't this it? No, it isn't. This dream will kill us all. l'm not ready to wake up yet. Follow us to Seoul! Or drop your swords! Grand Alliance! Mong-hak, don't go. Don't go to SeouI... That hurts! Don't touch me. Don't touch me, idiot! Don't die! Don't cry on me. Goodness. Good-looking boy. ls the moon up? The sun hasn't even set yet! lt's about time for it to show. lt's up. lt's always there, behind the clouds. You blind fool! Have you ever even seen the moon? Just stop talking. We have to catch Lee Mong-hak together! Mong-hak went chasing after the setting sun. But is he a cloud, or the moon? Let's go to Seoul. Hurray for General Lee Mong-hak! Your Highness. You must retreat from Seoul. Retreat? To where? To Euiju, which is close to China. No, your Highness. To Hamkyung Province. He must flee to China if something happens! What's there in Hamkyung? You can't even agree to run away! General SHlN lost at Chung-ju, sir. Within a day or two, the Japanese will be here. Bong-seok, we're almost there. Let's stop them at Seoul. And leave the people who trusted us and came here? Let's go to Seoul. lf we leave now, the Japanese will kill them all. This is an order. This is wrong! Mong-hak! What's gotten into you? l will not leave. No, Your Highness! How can a king desert his palace and his people? lmbeciles, step aside! What? You call yourself a servant of the throne? Clear the way! Should we die, it must be here! Lee's rebel forces are charging here! We must retreat to stop the Japanese! How? The royal forces have joined Lee's rebels! That's why we must retreat! Your Highness! lf you must go, kill us first! Let's go. What is this? Where is everybody? Hey! Get out here! Let's fight! You cowards! Come out and fight! We came all this way... The rebel forces are here, so come stop us! You cowards! Where are you?! Where are the Japanese? They've passed the South gate. We will protect the palace! lt's ours now, isn't it?! We live together, and die allied! Grand Alliance! There's nowhere else to go. This... This was what you left for? What are you doing here? Lee Mong-hak! You took all those lives just for that throne? You think that will change the world?! Who are you? Me? Just a mutt with no dreams. Han Shin-kyun's bastard son! Stand and fight! A new world? Bullshit! Did you ever see it? Has such a world ever existed?! Hwang said to me, Nobles hide behind power, clowns behind masks, and swordsmen behind swords. But l couldn't stand such a world! This is our land not yours, you bastards! Fight! Aim, fire! Fire! Fight! Stand your ground! Don't retreat! Stand strong! Throw them! Mong-hak! Mong-hak... ls this a dream? l'm not a part of that dream of yours... But you're part of mine. Baek-ji... We'll meet in our dreams. ln our dreams. ln our dreams. Hey. ls the moon up? No. Maybe behind the clouds? No! There aren't any clouds! Don't talk back! - Slow down! - Quit whining. He must be off Iooking for me. Our sad paths do not cross. I Iie waiting for my dream, hoping to meet him there. The moon is up. l told you, idiot. lt's a full moon, eh? l don't know! Stop asking! Goddamn. Must be grand, seeing everything. Must be easy, seeing nothing.
