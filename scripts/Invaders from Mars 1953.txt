The distance of Venus, Mars' atmosphere, the size of Jupiter and the speed of Mercury, we know them. But Heaven has kept his secret. What life, if there is one, exists on these other planets? Y does it like us humans? Inferior beings? Dangerously or higher? Continually seek the answer to this question, Such is the concern scholars. Of famous scientists or unknown ... Scholars from major universities or to smaller, Scholars ... of all ages. What are you doing, honey? Nothing, Mary. I'll make the coffee. It is 4 am. 4 hours! The alarm clock rang. You dreamed. It is about 7:30, as usual. It's that rascal ... David ... I did not want to wake you up. You saw earlier? Orion is at its zenith. It will not happen in six years. Let me see. It's not worth it? It's true we see the well. We always see Rigel, but locate the great nebula ... While the two in bed! I told him that ... I've already learned for a husband, my son should follow in his footsteps? Come on, David, in bed. - A few more minutes. - No, it's much too early. And will not move forward to hear your mother in the kitchen. No, your father. I earlier I wake up, before I sleep. Good night, David. Good night, Mom. Good night, Dad. You sleep, huh? Okay. Good night, my son. - Dad! - What was there, son? One trick landed in the sandpit. Something bright! - Huh? - I'll show you! You had to stay in bed? I was sleeping. It woke me up. A light that illuminated everything! It landed right there! You dreamed! If it was a meteor, everyone would be awake. But it did not fall! It has landed! - A spaceship? - How big? - As big as ... - A plane? Bigger! I do not see anything outside. Not anymore. But ... Go back to bed, my boy. All that is in your imagination. - I saw it! - How was it? Difficult to specify. A light that has weakened. Then a buzz. Tomorrow, wake up, if there are a saucer, it will notify General Mayberry. - But ... - Tomorrow! OK! Be reasonable. Good night. - What's going on? - Go back to sleep. - David calmed down? - Yes! Sorry to have woken up. - Why do you rise? - Nothing. I come back. George! What's going on? David said he saw something in the landing field. This is absurd, but he seemed sure of himself? "Landing"? He said he saw bright light and ... Imagine, this is not his style. My job is top secret, I must report any discrepancies. - It puts the sounds ... - Sounds? But I can not tell you. I'd better go see. George! George! Where is your son now? He sleeps. I did not wake up. Your husband has put his slippers, he came out and it disappeared? Go see if you find it! Your husband has never disappeared before? But no! You know, scholars are so distracted ... My husband is an engineer. It's not a wacky! Instead go see ... We must know all the facts. Our report was to be done. Come on, Blaine. There's one, for sure. Flying saucers! And then what? Let's go. He is not here. Precisely, I'd love a coffee. - George MacLean! - It's been there. Take the north, I take this side. Farewell coffee. - Did you sleep well, darling? - Yes. What time is it? Almost eight hours. - Where is Daddy? - He left early. - He promised me ... - Enough. Your mother is tired ... We'll drink coffee? Are you there? I was worried! He was not at the factory? Whatever. - Where were you? - I went to see Bill Wilson. - In your pajamas? - In pajamas, actually. - But ... - End point. - Your other slipper? - End point! Notify the police ... What police officers? I was afraid. I warned the police. They're looking for. - David, will tell them ... - Stay where you are! They are outside? Yes. What's going on? What has he? Do me the pleasure to take care of your onions. These police will question me. Their answer? - You can tell them well ... - It's coming for coffee? Outside, you saw something? You will not start with your saucers! - Dad! - What now? On your neck, it looks like a ... A scratch of barbed wire ... There are none ... Of barbed wire, I tell you! File get dressed! Yes, hurry up. You have errands to run. I'm sorry ... This is your husband? George MacLean. Heartbroken my wife has disturbed you. - It does not matter. - You ... you feel good? Yes, very well. We will not report. Everything is forgotten, is not it, Mary? - Coffee? - Do not talk nonsense. These gentlemen have an important task. Yes, you too. Yes, I know. See you. You waiting for? Looks like you plotting. Do not talk nonsense! I told you to get dressed! Well? What is happening? - I want to see mom. - She dresses. - What do you want? - Nothing. What are you doing? Nothing. I play. Go and play with Andy. Approach. I warn you: defense of storytelling what you claim to have seen. Got it? Who was that? Your son. He told me he was going to Andy. We start in town? You go first accompany me outside. I have something to show you. Mr. Wilson is there? No, my husband left until tonight. Why? Party? My father told me he saw him this morning! You must be mistaken, my dear. You're the first to come this morning. What's going on? Ms. Wilson, Kathy has disappeared. Disappeared? What do you mean? In the sandpit. I saw through the telescope. Swallowed up! Where is she? What has happened? It's true! The floor was opened ... David, answer me! Where is she? Kathy! Where were you? I went to pick flowers. David! You dare to come and terrorize me! Sorry ... - Making up stories like that! - I'm sorry. Ms. Wilson, there is fire you! Look, David ... Firefighters! Unnecessary. We spilled gasoline. There was fire everywhere! Were stored gasoline in the garage! There is a spilled bottle and that's what burns! You played in the basement? The 4-3-5-5-9, please. Hello, David. Sorry, Professor Kelston is out. message When he returns? In my opinion, not before this afternoon. Damn! Well, never mind. Thank you. Here, Mr. Mitchell. The fun! Jim! Jim! They had Kathy! They had my father! What? I saw it land there and ... - Minute. You saw what land? - A spaceship. I saw it! Are you kidding? It's true, I say! The police, them they did the same. Who? Believe me! You gotta help me. We have to help Dad. Okay, but calm down. - Where are you going? - Call. Do not call Dad! Do not worry. I come back. I want to see the Chief. Chef? It must be important. I must see him. What's bothering you? You can tell me, to me. I refer to the Head. When one wants to see the Chief, I must first explain why. I have no time. Let me see it! - You would not believe me. - And the Chief? What's going on? You're in luck. This kid is determined to see you. It appears that I would not believe. - You're the Chef? - It's me. What do you want? You talk one on one. Between. What do you want? It's hard to explain, but ... How's your name? David MacLean. The son of George MacLean? Yes, but my father must know nothing about. Minute! Let go of me. They got him! He'll kill me if I say! The-loop. I warn her father. - What is he? - He lost his head. Come, now, calm down. I saw his neck! Do not let him call my father! They'll do as Kathy, I know! - Going out? - You have completed? Yes, he is terrified! Maybe there should be ... No way to join his father. I'll get it. Doctor? Sergeant Finley. I have a kid which is totally freaked out. I know the kids. This is terrorized. Thank you. - Who are you? - Dr. Blake, David. I'm not sick! I know, but you have a history to tell. A Secret History. A doctor is like a priest. We can tell him everything. I'm here for. I can see your neck? It unlocks or something? Of course. Do not be shy. - How are you? - Yes, I think. I only talk to you. Are you? Yes, we will agree. Do not you, David? If necessary, shout. It all started last night ... It's true! They are there. I do not know what they do to people. But they are changed? Rather! My father, person does it comes close! Today it looked like an alien. Just ask Mom. That's what I'll do. You believe me, then? I do not know. It sounds so amazing ... - Wait for me. - You leave me? I'll be right back. Unnecessary. I will not fly. I know. But the settlement, that's the rule. I have never seen it. Two police have reported the disappearance of G. MacLean and searched the surrounding area? They should report it although it reappeared? We must record everything. And 5 copies. - The Leader is there? - He has not returned. I can call? Do so. I am Ms. MacLean. Glad to see you. Your Head told me David was there. Indeed. It is a little panicked. Wait. I'll get it. David, I know him well! He called me but I was out. He came to the observatory before the security measures. No ... not David. It's a boy that down to earth. But of course, Pat. David told me he had seen a spaceship. Come on, David. - Stop your nonsense! - Thou hast quite bored. Minute! This child will not come out of here. Who are you? Dr. Blake. Your son was entrusted to me. Ever! The Chief said ... Whatever. This child is here. It is watered journal of science fiction! It has more control over him. I point that your son has a fever. His pulse is abnormally rapid. It has all the symptoms of polio. I'll do admit to hospital. We will follow! If it gets better, we'll talk. Listen to me. Stop telling nonsense. Got it? We have to take him to ... Too bad. It's too late. Come. Mom too! They not panic easily! They are nice! They did suffer something awful! Come, little one. I'll take you to the hospital. No, he did nothing. Fortunately, Keltson told me about you. You do not leave lead by your imagination. - You know Mr. Kelston? - My favorite astronomer. Come, let us go hence. - But the Chief ... - Tell him he's with me. Hello, miss? Kelston. Priority A 14. Closed circuit. 1-2-7. What does it mean? We'll save my parents? I hope, David. General Mayberry? It reminds me of an emergency. The following number: WJ 738. I thought, he will laugh. I'm not kidding! How do you think they came? Probably with what David said he saw. A spaceship! Where? Maybe a flagship in free orbit above the atmosphere. But he, where is it? David, land, what planet is closest to ours? Venus? Exact. But which is closest to us because its orbit? In March. At 50 million km. And we, we turn around the sun. More than 150 000 km / h! Leaving our orbit, it would be faster on Mars. We look through a telescope? If Mars left its orbit, they reach us! A 150 000 km / h friction burn them, right? In space, no atmosphere, therefore no friction. Where would a space ship? - In the ground, I saw it! - It's inconceivable! This is what our forefathers said aircraft. We know nothing of these people ... if they are people. What do you mean? Here we go. I am deprived of the telescope. Opportunity makes the thief. There is not enough oxygen on Mars and it's too cold for men to survive. Therefore, one theory cities are underground. Where people live so in spaceships. You do not believe it? - I am a scientist. - We can not prove it. No less than otherwise. Martians may well have been raising synthetic beings to save themselves. Synthetic beings? They are called "mutants". Mutants? But what are they looking here? With us? Ok, an update. A rocket? I thought it was an atomic plant. It is an atomic device. The most powerful rocket ever. Once launched far enough in space, it will exist. Shortly, there will interplanetary stations operating at the Atomic Energy and remote. If attacked, it supports a button and you destroy the opponent. It is because of these rockets ... Put yourself in their place. You are Martian. Thanks to your mutant, you found a way to save your race. You have giant vessels with enough oxygen to them. This launches another planet rockets that threaten your survival zone. You would not react? This is unimaginable! As was the airplane. What does David's father? He is an engineer at the plant. Where they make it? My father never wants to talk about it. Because that's when we made the engine of the rocket. Why pick Kathy Wilson? For nothing, David. Except that his father is Dr. Wilson. - Physicist? - The father of the rocket. They burned his house. How did they do it set fire? What have they done to my parents? You know them. - They are nice. - I can not answer you. But we will eventually find. See the place where you saw the light. The railing! She ran along the whole sandpit! I had not noticed. It disappeared! I increase the magnification. Tags too! Dad! Closer, Dr. Kelston! What? - The General Mayberry! - What you called? It controls the entire sector. Dad wants to stop the Martians. Dad! Oh! As Kathy! Not his father! They control his father and General. Here, Kelston. Priority A-14. Coral 1-2-7 Bluffs. This is urgent! Colonel Fielding! Understood. Call the Staff the Pentagon. I come back. Two other companies for the plant. 3 others in Coral Bluffs. Two other Centre Magnesium. Load in person ... Heard. Else, sir? Well, sir. The Chief of Police. The Chief has been gone for a while. No way of contacting him. We called the radio of his car. Blaine and Jackson have also disappeared. I do not know where they are. Count our absolute discretion. Thank you, sir. It was Colonel Fielding who commands the troops. It has launched a search on Mac Lean, Chief, Ms. MacLean, Blaine, Mayberry and General Jackson. Luckily I will not stop General! The general it gets angry easily! Then you came. That's it. Thank you, David. This is a very clear story. Where is the little Kathy? One who set fire to her? She lives next door. Mr. Turner knows where she is. It is their neighbor. Right. You will all join me. The poor, it is almost crazy. He has something. She lost his house and his little girl! She died suddenly? In seconds. She played as usual, and then she collapsed. Thank you, Mr. Turner. A moment. What was the diagnosis of death? Cerebral hemorrhage. - I see. Thank you. - Where is Rinaldi? I think it is still the phone. I would like to examine this little girl. Embolism in a child this is absurd. But if his neck was the brand ... My driver will take you there. If you need to cross our dams doctor Jones will help you. - We will be at Mac Lean. - Thank you. The order was sent to? This is, just after the barrier. Try to be precise. - Where over the fence? - I do not know. When we saw the General fall, it was from another angle. I'll show you. It is quite ready like that, currently. You will see better. Yes, it is there. The bridge crossing the sandpit as the barrier. This is where they took Kathy. I can take a look? Is there a kind of trap? If this is the case, it is well hidden. No, there is no trap. We should see a crack, something. However, there is nothing. What do you think? Do I believe a spaceship is pressed? In my turn, a question. Could burrow without exploding? If they have a radius ... As X-rays? A radioactive beam capable of drilling the ground. We'll soon find out. Rinaldi! Where is he gone? You are aware? - Yes, but ... - No "but". Everything is true. Glad to see you, Roth. This is our expert in electronics. Is it possible that a ship will be buried under there? Yes, with infrared waves we do not know master. These beings are not of our planet ... If they have infrared as we have radio waves, they can melt the ground or anything. A very destructive weapon? Yes. And we would no parade. Your orders, sir? Protect facilities sector against any attack and explore the basement of the sand pit. Where General Mayberry has he gone? Here, at the end of the barrier. Take that. Rinaldi comes close. Rinaldi! Always to take risks. 20 years have been for nothing. This sound! Give them to me. - They got him! - Do not go! 20 years he is with me. They will have none other. If it's war they want, they will! As soon as the other fixtures will be there, steer-by 3 more and keep the sector. That no approach by without my order. The remaining projectors sweep the area. These devils can emerge anywhere. Sergeant, I said that no one should ... This is your doctor. Found something? An interesting thing. The autopsy revealed that object that caused the embolism. What do you think? Looks like a crystal attached to a part of platinum. - Where? - At the base of the skull. It is this world which explodes, to caused his death. Mom ... Dad ... Do not worry. They do not use it to kill people. A revolutionary surgery. This small gear attached to the brain is intended to control it. It has experienced on white mice ... These Martians tlcommanderaient those they have made? In every detail? And, once reached their goal, them they would explode ... the brain? His parents went there. We can reproduce it. Why. With this receiver it would capture their wavelength. And their message? No, this would only pulses. But localiserait source. - At work, Captain. - Yes, sir. Hurry, out of pity. Fielding, I listen. Bravo ... No, nothing else. We just blow up the factory. Stop! Do not move! Do not touch him! You, come here! What did he? He was fine and ... Yes, go ahead. Take them to the morgue. They arrested two cops. Both marked on the neck. They blew up the factory. - We killed them? - No. They died as the small. Provided they are my parents before they commit a crime! I do not want them to die! - Stop or I'll shoot! - Targets feet. I am General Mayberry! Damn, it's true! We stop. Let go of that. Hands up! What was that? Their suitcases were stuffed of nitroglycerin. To you, sir. Fielding, I listen. Both to shreds. Yes, the rockets are intact. No new instructions. Continue. Our men ... Tanks! In principle, it comforts you. Okay, Major Cleary. If they have this radius, I do not know what will our tanks. They surround the area. Order to place two charges where Rinaldi disappeared. Order to encircle the area. Encirclement sector. - It's here. - Go ahead, dig. Brainard? What has he? There, Dr. Wilson. I did not find you here. We are shocked of what happened to Kathy. - What you say, except ... - Thank you, Brainard. You prefer to work? You do not want ... Be somewhere else? No, thank you. I love working at night. We must continue. Good night, Brainard. No Parking! My car has an ignition problem. You could take a look? I'm not mechanical, but I will see. Press the accelerator. The ignition is on? Oh ... Excuse me. Left running. Corporal, rush to the hospital! There was a shelter down there. Your lamp. - I go there. - This I command! You guys, follow me. - All right, sir? - Yes, I think. Go down with a rope. It's deep. Go ahead, go down. What do you think? They have a radius. Capable of drilling and liquefied the earth. It is phosphorescent. Yes, the brightness down quickly. Because the radius has disappeared. Where did they take Rinaldi? They had to drill a tunnel they have blocked behind them. There is not much more advanced before being lowered. You are ready to hoist ourselves? All right, go ahead. They moved elsewhere. Found something? We connected the crystal a variable oscillator. It has not been damaged, we should catch waves. These creatures could not go far. WXBY. Here, Sergeant Funston. I listen. Do not quit. Dr. Blake? - It's me. - This is for you. Who is it operating? Right. He knows how it connects. Call me when it's over. His parents are on the table. It would be better warn him. I think so. - Are you cold, David? - Okay. If only ... Want news your parents? Let's go for a walk. Found your parents. Where? They are not like Kathy? They are not dead. - I can see them? - Not yet. Dr. Mtzler the works. This is a good neurosurgeon. A neurosurgeon? It should be able to withdraw crystal and ... And it will not happen what happened to Kathy! No, everything will be fine. I'll know when? - The doctor is not there yet. - Not there yet? Patience. He just Middletown. An hour away! Only he can operate. In an hour, Martians can ... Do not worry. Everything will be fine. But nobody can identify anything! These Martians, we must stop them ... Roth! Fielding! Here! Come here! Mutants! - We stay here? - Yes. A minute. Let me go! Let me go! Colonel Fielding! Still looking. They are here. Nothing. They have already left. It does a minute! Digging other holes will not help. Come. Stop! Leave me! Here! They are here! A charge here. do draw the tanks of the other side. They will believe they are looking elsewhere. They will perhaps enjoy. Sergeant Rinaldi! How's your name? David! You know me! Not you ... You! How is your name? Dr. Blake, you know. What are they doing up there? What are they doing? Who is it? The human race in its higher form. Those are his slaves, they exist only to serve. You will become like them. What are they doing up there? I do not know. Tell her shortly. Let's go. Let go there! Tell them to let go! If you received my parents, I ... Hurry! Hurry up! Colonel Fielding! Colonel! It's the boy! Come! What is this thing? Blast it! Pat! You have nothing? They will take off! Explosives! Whereof do all fart until March! Where is David? - And Rinaldi? - I do not know. Give me all these tunnels scrutinized. And hurry! You are given the signal. Once it's ready, it blew up. I took him up there. Colonel Fielding! Look for the small and Rinaldi! At the signal, returning at a run! Wait! What has he? I heard a noise. Resume. Crawling with monkeys. Made clear. Remove all except Jack. We will remember them. Colonel warned. Retirement. How long? It's ready. What fixed delay does one? 6 minutes. That's enough to go up. We shoot! Then block access. A grenade! These monkeys can no longer touch the detonator. Colonel Fielding! They blocked the way out. Should be delayed the detonator! Impossible. We can no longer access it! How long? About 3 minutes. Aim at mouth to stop them! The disintegrating. There they are! It's the boy! Everything is going to jump. We must get out of here. Rinaldi! Alive! - Take it, fast! - Why? The outcome is blocked. This thing will save us. - How many more? - More than 2 minutes. - We have how many? - 90 seconds. - It comes out at the moment. - Stay with him. You know you use it? Help him. Stand back, boys. Galloping! Right. The small, first. Gently! Rinaldi, now. Go! Everything is going to jump! Hurry up! Mom! Dad! Are you okay? Of course we're fine! What happens, son, you were scared of lightning? No, that's not it! You went to the hospital? Of course not, we slept. There is no reason to be afraid. What's wrong? It was horrible, I thought that something had come. They were green and hairy, and the fence was gone. What fence? That of the sand pit. Well, let's take a look ... It's gone now. Well, here we go and we are always the same. You dreamed my boy! I hope so. Sleep well, my boy ...
