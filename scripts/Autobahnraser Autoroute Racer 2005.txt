Breaker 1-9. The highway pirates left with my Twin Turbos. All units, a car theft on the A-40 between Duisburg-Homberg and Moers. There. Good lord. Your hands are all covered in yucky stuff. Can I help you? No, that's ok. Just pay attention, next time you can do it yourself. I wont have to. There's always a loser that stops. This is commissioner Schmitt. We are flying right above them. Wait for my orders. We are going to arrest them. This is going to be a great day. Pay attention. They cannot escape through the exit. They are passing the exit. They are driving straight on. Units 2421 and 4002 are in pursuit. At last. Thanks. Schmitt to all units. Close off exit 128 immediately. come on, guys, you can do this. don't let them get away. Quickly. block the exit. Fuck. What are those assholes doing? Whose orders are they following? Schmitt to all units. The highway pirates are back on the A-40. What are you doing? High voltage cables. I have to fly higher. Dammit, they are getting away. Is there anyone listening to me? Is anybody there? No, everyone is in pursuit. Are you kidding? Is there nobody on the A40 towards Duisberg-Homberg? There must be somebody around here somewhere. Officer Krause. Krause, hurry up, follow them. - Who? The six Audis, dumbass. Leave now. Krause, you moron. What have you done? I'll rip your ass apart. Do you know what you have done! You will pay. You are a disgrace to the police. No, to all of humanity, dammit. Every car has to be tested. I will check it fast. Let me see what this baby can do. That's not standard. So much power. And now? Hello. Your papers, please. - What's wrong? Did I drove too fast? You were going faster than 210 km/h. What? That's impossible. Did you fool around with the speed indicator? No. - Yes you did. It has to be. Have it checked, or I will disapprove the car. You will get a ticket. Sure sure. A warning will not do. Wait a minute. I didn't even drive. Did you see that? soon they will have their own T-shirt. Wait. - You must do something about that. All in time. - Right, officer. They are just laughing at you. I don't want last night to repeat itself again, ok? trace whatsoever. Be so proud. And it is the third time under my command. That's why you will get a special training to avoid further disasters and to prepare you. Any questions? I got something, I think. Krause... If I were you, I wouldn't draw so much attention But if you insist... I have something you must see. must see? or should see? He wants a company picknick No, I think that Grillfest is the codename For illegal speedway races. - Speedway races? Yeah. It's today. If we plan it well. We can catch them. We? Yeah. They cause problems. They are laughing at us. We must catch them. Alright, alright. You are convincing. Deal with them, Krause. Do you know whose car this is? Why? Do you want to buy it? Unfortunately, it is too expensive. I do want to challenge it. To challenge it? For a piss contest? For a race. With that piece of junk there? - Yes, with that. Why not? Listen, you don't stand a chance. It's best to save your energy. I'm willing to bet on it I'm in a race with some friends later on. The owner of that car can send me a message. Where? - If he registers he gets a message. Alright? - Alright. Thanks. Come on. Hold on. Can we come? - Yeah sure, great. What was that all about? Ask information about Grillfest. Message send. You are registered for Grillfest. Hurry up. This is a special training, Not a walk in the park. Krause... Let's repeat special training. Speedway racers. - Good. Like this you can't cause damage. I hope. Grillfest, parking Zollverein, Sushi Express. Sushi Express. Hello. Sushi Express. Express? Is that funny? You were supposed to come here at 6.15pm It's 6.15pm right now, man. And a smartass as well Can you believe this? No, everything ok. perfect. - I want to send everything back. Said so before then. What are you doing? Leave the sushi here. Bringing, taking... Make up your mind, man. Watch your mouth, ok? I practise Karate. Not a good idea. - Honey, don't look. Hello. Keep it. Thanks. I am Moni. I am Bruno. Sorry about that mess. - Oh well. And that's my car Just kidding. It's from the neighbours. It's not...? - My ex? That's his. And now? I can't pee anymore. Grillfest? Grillfest. Grillfest. Dammit. Weren't you going to get another car. These are identical. Perhaps on the outside they are. But what's inside is important. Do you still think my car's beautiful? Why didn't you tell me it was yours. I made a fool out of myself. Why? We can still race, can't we? Against you? No way, that wouldn't be a fair race. I thought you were going to race that ancient car of yours. Why not? A car can't race when it's not new? Even if it was new you wouldn't stand a chance. You are self assured, aren't you? Is everything ok? - Everything is fine. Bruno, I'm going to kick your ass. - Yeah? I'll wait for you at the finish. What a cutey. What? Easy, babe, this is a race. Don't you want me to drive? - Get your license first. There's nothing about it. I am a natural talent, like Maverick. I feel the need for speed. I'm ready. Won't we take my car? - Which one you have? It's certainly faster than this. - Yeah? We'll see about that. Drive. Drive, drive. It has been fun. Bye. You don't see that every day. He is gaining on us. Faster.! - He'll never give up. You're too slow.! - Leave me alone.! What are you doing? I can't believe this. This is madness. That's a Polo, not a Ferrari. Get rid of him. What a hidious Polo, man. He's filming us, man. He films us. Shake him off. Ok guys, concentrate. The training starts now. Wait, there are two cars coming. Let them pass. Nice, cops. It was just disapproved. Everyone ready? Let's go. There's oil on the road. - Keep on going. Nice driving, dumbass. You're welcome. Is everything OK? I just hurt my neck. You can't drive. - And you are not allowed to drive. Come on, give me some space. - Alex, you are breaking the car Let me drive. I have gasoline in my blood. Drive. You drive. - Are you crazy? Move over. I'll show you how it's done. I can't wait. Well done. Some applause from the backseat please. I want to sit in front. - Come. Jump to the frontseat. I rule the world. Pass by that ugly polo now. - I'm giving it all that I have. Record this, dude. Go ahead, record this. That's how you do it. Come on, baby. Enough playing. Magnicificent. The damage is less worse than it looks. But what counts, is that the men are unharmed. And the stolen cars? And the highway pirates? That's classified. You can understand that. Can you say anything about the screw up that your men did? And, do you see your new friend? I've no idea what you are talking about. A beer? I will find him. - I knew it. Keep the change. I'm sorry. I didn't see you. - Great. My honest apologies. How cool. No... - don't be like that. I have to adjust it. Good. Why are you standing here then? - I wanted... Wait. Follow me. Come on. Haven't I seen you before on one of those pin-up calendars? Nice, we don't need a jack. - Oh well, you know... My regular mechanic doesn't let me spin the crankshaft. Everything in time. First your oilpipe, Then we will check your hydraulics. Alright? Alright. Come. I can't walk around like this. I'm going to take it off. Ok. Although, I can wait a bit don't I look crappy like this? - You look beautiful. There they are. Record this. The winner... The winner is... Bruno. George came in second. Third place... Eddie. Nice. Not bad for your first time. Fourth. Fifth. Sixth. Seventh. Eighth. Ninth. And... Thank you. Thank you. Even the best have a bad day. Ok, I will confiscate all the evidence. Police. Your papers, please. Nice try. He is pissed off because he lost. What a great sense of humor Don't I know you from somewhere? Karl Krause. Call me Knut. Did you squeeze 177km/h from a Baron - 228 km/h with a Smart. What a waste of time. - Next time, ok? Here, take it for a drive. No, thanks. - Come on. I'm not that kind of type - Ofcourse you are. Come on. Have fun. And, How fast are we driving? Not right now. I'm concentrating. You are really cute, you know that. - You are cute too. I said it first. Goodmorning. Krause... Your information about the speedway race was really bad! Why? - Or they respected the law. No one was flashed? - Why the smile? We have flashed one. - Really? Do you recognize him? No, I've no idea. I knew this was a waste of time. May I ask how fast he was driving? Do you want me to chase him? Go ahead. Make it your calling. It's just a Polo but can't you do something? Can't you buy something faster? Those Grillfests are possibly over - Why? There's police everywhere since those carthefts started. You sometimes have the company car. Use that one then. By the way, Where do you work? I work for the government - Like a civil servant Tax controller - Or an officer. That's right Don't erase. Those were the numbers of the participants. Now you can contact everyone with my computer. And what if your computer is miles away from us. Then I send it a message. - Your computer? Yeah, he takes care of everything The computer guy Knut. Bello. The dog wants to play with me - Have fun. What does that dog have? - Looks like a frisbee. Wait, I want to play too. Driveways are the most difficult for firstimers. Before you know it, you drive into the canal. A Viper and a Diablo They can manage 330km/h Yeah, but we are slower. - Look at those machines. Oh no... - Miss... Those guys... Those are the guys from the news. Those are the highway pirates - Have you ever... Stop right there - Yeah, but... Leave the highway slowly - Look there. In a second. Exit the highway. I'm right back. Leave the engine on. A Renault with licenseplate KR-KG867 was stolen by a student without a license Ever seen a drivingstudent with a drivers license? I want a copy Come on. What's this about? Appearantly it was fun. - Does she take off her bra or not? Give me that - I want that one. Are you out of your mind? Krause... This is the evidence, right? The speedway racers, right? - That's right. But I'm not finished yet. You maybe not, but we are. Thanks to this tape that you were hiding from us. Krause, my my... Next time, listen to me. Krause, come in. Let's continue. This can be over soon, if you admit that you stole the red renault with licenseplate KR-KG867. No, why should I? I was getting a drivinglesson You were doing 160km/h on the highway without your instructor. Yeah, that was weird. I looked to the right and she was gone. Was she in the car when you took off? I think that she left during the lesson. Perhaps she was bored? How about this then? That has nothing to do with this. I followed those roadpirates, ok? You would have done the same, eh? I know you, eh? Ok, enough talking He wants to screw us Now I know it. You are the guy of yesterday. You rat me out. Yeah, great. Ok, that will do. I take it from here. Because of you I'm in this mess. - I'm in this as well, you know. Nice friend you are. It's not my fault that you drove You tell me. Now what? You followed them. Do you know where they are? The old warehouses. - What cars did you see? This young man can go. Everything is taken care of. I've to speak to Schmitt right away. Sherlock... Can I keep this? Cool. The old warehouse. That's where the roadpirates are hiding out. Did that little speedway racer tell you that? Do you trust him? If he is lying I will kick him in the balls. Ok. Where are you going? - To arrest those roadpirates. Dream on. You work on the speedway racer case. There is a Grillfest, without us. There's a Polo all ready - Everything but that. Where do you want me to place this car? In the back there's a parking - Don't crash this car. Don't you want me to drive, officer? - First you get your license. There's nothing to it. I'm a natural talent. Floor it! I'm already reaching the 220km/h You love the Grillfest, right? - You bet. And? It's ok, for an oldtimer. That's all it could do. Someone would have told the police? You were hanging up pamflets to keep it a secret. Are you going to blow it off? - Yeah. In a Porsche, superfast. Fantastic, chickenskin. Highway, Sirene on. Flashpole, Come to me. Sheriff Karl is flying. Alex sits in the frontseat. Grillfest cancelled? What would be going on? - Look around you. Cops are everywhere. Just when we could challenge them with this. We would have shown them a thing or two. What a car. - Alex, I was worried sick about you. My friend is a cop He got me out. Hello. I let the police drive my Mustang? What's this about? Take it easy. You told him to get a faster car. What's going on? Easy, he's with us. I trust him. Do I look stupid to you? - No, it suits you great. What are you doing here? I wanted to know if there is another Grillfest soon. You are out of luck, your friends are everywhere. Until those roadpirates are arrested. - That can take a while. Right. That's why it will be a long time before we race. It was my first race. Yeah, mine too. So the police is not chasing us? No they just want to have the roadpirates. They are going to arrest them today. Great. So no worries there. Then we race tomorrow. I mean... I nkow how it will end. This is going to be a lovely day. - It's going to be a lovely day. Come. Who called the police? - You are surrounded You? - Why always me? Hands up. Great plan. As a cop I would have done the same. But what would a roadpirate do? Come. - Last chance. Come out with your hands up. Fuck. That's why I need you. We must set a trap for them. Their fast cars are no problem. He is right. Maybe the fastest doesn't win, but the smartest does. And we are smarter. - What are you proposing? I've got an idea. I have laptops and some other toys. Did she say toys? GPS-software and transmitters. All we've to do is put them on the cars. No problem. What...? Wonderful. Now what? Is he with us? - I don't know Sushi Express. Who ordered the californian rolls? Who ordered sushi? You? Why always me? I didn't order anything. I deal with him? Get lost. - don't touch my hair. Who is this guy? We cancel the operation? Yeah and we come back again in two weeks. What were you thinking? - Chinese asshole Chinese?
