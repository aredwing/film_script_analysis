Where are you? Where are you? What did you say? You said yes, right? I don't know, it was late, there were drinks. Hannah, come on. Best friends get to hear first. Okay, if you must know... I've been tamed. - Congratulations. - Thank you. I'm so happy for you. Who starts an engagement story and then runs off laughing? She said yes. I think more drinks are in order. Drinks! Hannah's getting hitched! Hannah, where are we going? Just come on. Well, this is romantic. I don't know if you've heard, but I'm getting married. Yeah, that's the word on the street. And I have a couple of positions to fill. Like what? Like bartender, DJ... maid of honor? You want the gig? But... No buts. Just yes. Yeah, I'm in. Good. I gotta pee. Always classy. You know you can't do that in a wedding dress, right? I'll have to prove you wrong. Madison. Oh, God. That's it, you're all right. You're all right. You're okay. Shh, hey. You're okay. You're okay. You're all right. You're all right. What happened? What happened? - You're okay. - You fell into the lake. You hit your head. Let me see. No, no, no. There was something... No, no, no, you're okay. Shh, that's it. That's it. I think you've had enough for tonight. - It's okay. - We should go to the hospital. - Hey, look at me. You're okay. - Okay, she's fine. Show's over, people. Maddie, you're okay. It's okay. - We should get her warm. - Shh. That's it. You're okay. Are you fucking serious? For one night, for one very important night, you couldn't just suck it up and act like a normal human being? I have entertained these issues for the past year. Your ups and downs. It's not going to kill you, okay? You're not gonna drown from it. I understand what you went through, Maddie. I was there, but... fuck. - Hannah... - I don't want to hear it. You need to deal with this. I talked to the other girls. And this was supposed to be my night. Tomorrow... tomorrow, we're gonna deal with this. I tried, okay? I just... You just missed my wedding, Maddie. You're my maid of honor... and you just missed my wedding. What can I do to make it up to you? No! No! Be at my house tomorrow. 8:00 PM. So I've never seen a bride punch out a groomsman before. Yeah, that happened. Dabrowsky, during his speech. He called you the "afraid of honor." It sort of became the running joke of the night. Hannah did not find it funny. I wanted to be there. I... I just felt like something bad was gonna happen. Something bad did happen. You missed her wedding. Be there tonight. What's happening tonight? Hey, guys. Hey. This is Cathryn, Kobie's friend. She's gonna be helping us out tonight. I hope you don't mind, Maddie. Kobie's been telling me what's been going on and I have a bit of experience in the field. In what field? Contacting the other side. What? Don't worry, Maddie. Just take a seat and we'll fill you in, okay? You guys, I... I wanted to say that I'm... I'm so sorry about yesterday. Look, Maddie, we appreciate your apology, but we've all heard it before and nothing changes. We're all here because we love you. Don't worry about me. This is an intervention, Maddie. You need to understand that this is just a phobia. I know that it's a strong one. People overcome their fears all the time. It's not just that. That's why I'm here, Maddie. You know, from what I've heard, you might be experiencing hauntings. Let's not call them hauntings, okay? No, Hannah, these could be hauntings. I've been researching various methods of cleansing. We're gonna try and make contact with the entity you're seeing. Now, if it's an especially evil entity, then we... I'm sure it's something that can be easily helped. I've seen some malevolent spirits in my line of work. Entities that can do anything from blowing curtains to setting fires. There's a whole world beyond us that most people don't believe in, a dangerous place where tortured souls go to die - full of pain and... - Cathryn? Can I speak to you in the other room for a minute? Well, we're about to get started here. It will only take a minute. Listen, take it easy with the hauntings shit. Look, we want this to look real, but don't go overboard. Kobie said that you want to make contact. Yes, but this isn't an exorcism. Look, just wave some incense around and tell her that whatever it is that's keeping her up at night is gone so that she can move on with her life. Look, the last thing I need is you putting more crazy ideas in her head. She has a mental illness. - What if she's... - Listen, it's not real. Last time I'm gonna say it. Look, this was Kobie's idea and I reluctantly agreed to go along with it. Don't make me regret my decision. The room's set up. Cathryn's done this before. You don't need to worry. You guys, I'm... really not comfortable. Maddie, you are going, like, full-blown crazy and it needs to stop. You're here to do this, and nobody's going to leave this house until we give it a try. Try what? We'll show you. No, please, no, no. Don't worry. We would never make you do anything you didn't want to. Okay? But tonight you can prove to us that you're at least willing to try to get past this. Guys, please. I can't do this. Maddie, listen to me. We're all here for you. But you have to confront this tonight so you can see that there's nothing trying to hurt you. You'll be fine, I promise. This is how you make it up to her. You can either face it here with us or let it ruin you alone. Because after tonight... we're not gonna be here. Come on. It's okay. - Cathryn? - We need a conduit if you're going to make contact. The bathtub will act as a bridge to the other side. It's okay. We're all here. Everyone, relax. Take a few deep breaths. We want a comfortable environment to welcome our guest. You guys, I can't stress how much of a bad idea I think this is. Maddie, it's okay. Cathryn's a professional. Okay, here we go. We open ourselves up to communicate with whoever it is that wishes to speak to Madison. We welcome ourselves to this spirit. If you are here with us, please show us a sign. Um... that's good. We have someone here with us. Whoever you are, we are here to make peace. We are reassuring Madison that you are not here to harm her, but just a lost soul. If you do wish Madison any harm... show us a sign now. Well, that's good news. No, no, no. Don't break the circle. - What the fuck, guys? - That wasn't me. This is done. Maddie, relax. What? - It was all a hoax. - No, it's... No, it was a hoax. Sorry, we thought if we could convince you that nothing was wrong... we just thought it would help. Thanks for taking this seriously, you guys. Maddie, sorry. Look, we probably shouldn't have, but we can't keep watching you do this to yourself. I'm not trying to do this. I don't know what to do. Nothing helps. Look, if you really want to get better... we have to do something radical. Do you want to get better? You'll be safe. We're all here and we won't let anything happen to you. I can feel him. He's here. No, he's not. He's not real. Just face it, Maddie. Just lean back into our arms and you'll see once and for all. Don't let me go, okay? Pull her out! Pull her out! - I can't! - Calm down. She's gonna drown! Get her out! I can't! Get out of the way! Maddie! God, Maddie. Maddie? Maddie? Oh, shit. Maddie? Maddie? Maddie? Maddie, are you okay? Are you okay, Maddie? Maddie, what just happened? - Who is that? - What? Oh, my God, someone's here. - I just saw him. - Enough! No, I swear, someone was right there! You think playing mind games with her is okay? Were you holding her under? No, I didn't. I swear someone was right there. No more fucking games. Get out now! Maddie, I'm so sorry. That was supposed to help. Can I go home now? After a traumatic experience, the mind can have all sorts of different reactions. The visions you're having, you've created subconsciously. Like any phobia, it's the brain's manifestations that do the most harm. This fear is the same. I get what you're saying. But this is different. - What I'm seeing, it's... - It's in your head. I know you feel what you're going through, it's different. But trust me, I've seen it before. You have episodes when you're close to what you're afraid of. That's normal. It's your mind personifying your fear. Yeah. We can deal with this together, but I need you to embrace what I'm telling you. The longer you tell yourself these visions are real, the longer you're going to struggle. Do you really want to go through life taking your liquids through a tube? I know you've had a hard time growing up without a family, but you have one now with your friends. Don't let these issues ruin those relationships. Hello? Hi, I'm looking for Henley Jacobs. So probably gonna go... orange? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay. This is Butter. It's from London. So that's probably gonna blend in well with the dress you're wearing. Hi, you've reached Kobie. I can't get to the phone right now, but just leave a message and I'll get back to you. Hey, Kobie. You haven't returned my calls. Please get back to me. It's important. Shit. Hello? Maddie? What, you're not answering your phone now? Maddie? Hey, talk to me. I'm sorry about last night, okay? I'm just trying to help you get past this. I'll get past this on my own. Maddie, please. You're sick and you need help. Stop saying that, okay? Have you ever even asked yourself, "Maybe she's not crazy"? I don't know, maybe that's something a best friend should at least want to consider. I was just leaving. Maddie, please. I'm sorry, okay? Where are you going? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. I'll do it. Okay? I'll admit it. Last night freaked me out. I've been trying to and I can't explain what happened. You got me, okay? What if you're telling the truth? Let me by, please. Let me help. Look, whatever you wanna do, wherever you want to go, no questions. I promise. Look, Maddie, I messed up, okay? But just let me help. Please. Fine. Okay, I'll drive. Can you at least tell me who we're meeting with? His name is Henley Jacobs and he knows something that might be able to help me. That's all you need to know. Okay, Hannah, please just don't make this difficult. So what does he know? - Hannah, please. - Sorry, I'm done. I'm a fly on the wall. Fly on the wall. Who is it? Hey, it's, um... it's Madison. We spoke on the phone earlier. Come in and close the door. So what are you two young ladies doing in my house today? Um, I wanted to ask you about the Drownsman. Of course you do. What can you tell me about him? Nothing. I've wasted too many years discussing that topic. Please, sir, um... I'm seeing this man. How are you seeing him? In visions. Okay, out. Get out. Time to go. Sir... sir, please. It's getting worse, and I don't know how to stop it. Forget about it. Don't let it do to you what it did to me. Come on, Maddie, let's go. No. Please. I'm sorry for what happened. He killed your daughter. He killed other girls, too. What stopped him? Isabelle. She was to be one of his victims. But she drowned him. Drowned him in the same place that he drowned the other women. Where is she now? You don't want to speak to her. Please, sir, I think we would. Soon after she killed him, she said she also had visions. How did she stop them? She didn't stop them. She burned down her house, she burned the neighbor's house down. She killed the man who killed my daughter. Sir? Three, four times a day he would take me to the basin. I struggled until I realized he wasn't trying to drown me. It's not until your last breath is taken can you cross over. These are all the answers I could find. Did the police ever find his body? Just bones. All female. Take these memories. I don't need 'em anymore. Hey, how's our crazy little friend? Um, yeah, she's okay. When I got up this morning, I went downstairs and I poked my head into her room. She looks like she's losing her mind. Look, when are you coming home? I'm just finishing up here, why? Just get home, okay? We need to talk. Yeah, okay, sure. Oh, Jesus. You okay? So they're ramblings of a madman. Okay, like, "Last night, I spent the evening trying to drown myself in the bathtub in hopes he would take me." This guy's a nut. Okay, sorry. Got it. - It's just, why would... - Just please keep looking. Okay. Okay, so a number of women go missing over the years and then all of a sudden, one of them shows up... Saying that she's killed him, escaped, but the police can't find a body. Well, the woman sounds crazy. Why would they believe her? They didn't. Oh, shit. What? Shit! Hello? What's that? "The only records I've been able to find on Sebastian Donner are about his birth. On July 30th, 1954, Louise Donner passed away giving birth to an 18-pound baby. She had been pregnant with him for over 19 months. As a boy, Sebastian claimed he could vividly remember the sound of his mother's heartbeat... while in the womb." You good to close up still, Kobie? - Yeah, of course. - See ya. Bye. Kobie, please, you need to get out of here. What are you doing here? I seriously don't want to see you right now. Something's after us. All of us. I saw him. Oh, my God, Cathryn. I vouched for you last night. I told them that you could sell it, but instead you made it so much worse. Yes, I made it worse. We opened something, a gateway to something evil. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to stop it. Madison isn't making this up. We need to tell her. I'm here to warn you. Jesus, just leave me and my friends alone. I wouldn't be surprised if your friends are already dead. I wish I was lying. Get out. I wasn't holding her under. I wasn't even near the tub. Kobie, I wasn't holding her under. You know I wouldn't do that. Help me! Help me! Help me! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help me! Where are you? Show yourself. Terra ignus aqua. All three. Keep thy enemy away from me. Earth by divinity, divinity by earth. Keep thy enemy away from me. Please, no. Please. Okay, Isabelle. Let's start with his basement. Tell me about it. I remember the smell. It was horrible. Under the baseboards, he would keep the dead girls. I pretended I wanted to be with him. As I held him under, I swear I could feel his heart break. Then he was gone. But his soul would live on... in my womb. He raped her. He raped Isabelle, left her with a baby. Hannah, don't. Don't. Hannah, please. Hey, it's Lauren. Leave a message after the beep. Hey, this is Lauren's ph... That bastard. I felt bad for him some days. ...even through all his evil... ...his pain could be seen. His suffering. I'd see it for moments. Then it's back to the terrible, sick monster that he was. Maddie, I saw him! Who is that? Cathryn said to stay away from water. Where is she now? No. How? No, no. This isn't happening. There's got to be an explanation for this. She was trying to warn us. We have to get out of here. Where are we going? I know what you guys are gonna say... but shouldn't we call the police? Kobie, my best friends wouldn't even believe this is real. You think the police are going to? Maybe they've heard of something like this. Maybe they haven't, okay? And then who are they gonna blame? What are these? That night at the lake... my accident, this is what I saw. Look. Dr. Malcolm to ward three. Dr. Malcolm to ward three. - Oh, hello. - Hi. I'm looking for the whereabouts of a former patient of yours. Her name is Isabelle Heller. - Isabelle? - Yes, do you know her? - Yes, she's still here. - Could we see her? She hasn't had a visitor in a long time. It might be good for her. Oh, I have to ask you... do you have any matches, lighters, anything flammable? - No. - No. Good, Carter. Isabelle Heller has some guests. - You're here to see Isabelle? - Yes. Do you have anything flammable on you? - I already asked. - Okay. Well, then, follow me. Okay, thank you. We've had to be pretty careful after her incident. What happened? A few years back, Isabelle stole a lighter from a nurse. She lit the whole east wing on fire. We almost lost her. Isabelle Heller? We were wondering if we could ask you some questions. Please, it's an emergency. We want to know about Sebastian Donner. Sebastian. They said he spent too long in the womb, and when he held me under, he could feel my heartbeat echo through the water... like a baby child in its mother's belly. We've seen this man. First just me, but now he's after my friends. He took them. He first came to me in visions. He would come for you. I'm surprised you lasted this long. Wait, what do you mean "lasted this long"? Madison, come over here. How do you know my name? It means... gift from God. I gave it to you. There were too many fires. Mostly while you were still in my belly. But I just wanted to keep him away from you. My baby girl. You're my mother? So beautiful. Soft... and untouched. Even from his seed. He... he's m... He wants his daughter. You do not let him get her! No! Isabelle, please. Please, we need to know how to stop him. He's always waiting. He's always waiting to reach out for you! For me! A broken heart! He's so angry! He will take you there, all of you! - Calm down. - He wants his baby! - Time to rest. - No! - Time to rest, Isabelle. - No, he will get you! Time to leave, girls. - No, don't let him get her! - Go, now! Isabelle, it's okay! Relax. Code white! ...'cause he will get you! He will get all of...! It's gonna be okay, Maddie. We'll get through this. Get up on the railings now! Oh, no! What do we do? Kobie! Hold on! - I can't hold on! - Please, don't let me go! I can't hold on! Please! Please don't let me go! - Kobie! - No, Kobie! Oh, my God, Kobie. No, Kobie. This is where he takes them. She'll be there. Sebastian Donner's house. This is where we go. Hey, hey. Let's go find her, okay? Okay. Okay. Maddie? No. No. No. No! No! Die. It's close. All those fires that she started. She did it to keep him away. What? What are you looking for? Fire. Okay, Maddie, I want you to stay calm, okay? No, no. Maddie, stay calm. We're almost there. I know I haven't said it before, but I am so, so sorry. I should have at least considered the possibility that it was real... what you were seeing. To be honest, I didn't really believe it myself until tonight. Look, we watch each other's backs in there, okay? We're here. To keep him away. You gonna be okay in there? Hey, we'll be strong if we stick together. Yeah. Let's come back, okay? We have to go now. Ready? Not even close. He brings them to the basement. We need to find it. Hey, just stay close, okay? Hannah? Are you okay? Okay, I'm coming down. - Help, Maddie! - Hannah? - Maddie, help! - Hannah? Hannah? Hannah? Where are you? Hannah? Just take me. Hannah! Hannah! You gotta get me out! Please. Hannah, please. Hannah, come on. Madison, help me! Help me! Hannah? Hannah, please. Please, Hannah, please. Please, Hannah. Hannah. Come on. Hannah, please wake up. Please. Go again. Okay, okay. God. No. Please. Let me say good-bye. No. Father! I'm sorry. You've been like a sister to me. I love you. It's not until your last breath is taken can you cross over. Okay. The police were here. And they questioned me about the girls you were with. They're dead. Yes. It's okay. - No. - He's gone. No, no. I killed him. No. He hasn't been killed. He's been waiting. Isabelle.
