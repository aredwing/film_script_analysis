"Black Ships:" The ships of U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry's 1853 and 1854 expeditions to Japan. The Shogunate, pressured by the arrival of the Black Ships, signed a treaty opening the ports. This act incurred the wrath of the Emperor. Anti-Shogunate factions exploited this division. Radical ronin from the fiefs of Tosa and Choshu... ...justifying their actions as "divine punishment..." ...began to assassinate public officials and prominent members of the Shogunate. Signs: "Divine Punishment" ...began to assassinate public officials and prominent members of the Shogunate. "The capital:" Kyoto, home of the Emperor. The Shogunate rules Japan from Edo, however. There's an anti-Shogunate group gathering at the capital. They oppose any alliance between the Emperor and the Shogun. I get it! You're recruiting ronin to fight against the anti-Shogunate forces. Finally figured it out, eh? The Shogun's visiting Kyoto for talks with the Emperor about expelling the foreigners. We ronin have an important mission. It's been 250 years since a Shogun last visited Kyoto. This is getting exciting! It's our chance to go down in history! I'm going to do it! Yamanami, come with us. I'm leaving it up to Kondo. I'll discuss it with him after he returns from his training in Tama. How about you, Okita? I'd like to attend as a representative of our Shieikan dojo. I want to live a life of valor and gallantry, dedicated to the way of the sword. Here, have a sugar candy. What will you do, Isami? I plan to go. I too wish to protect our Shogun. The farmers of Tama have prospered under the divine guidance of the Tokugawa clan. And all this domestic squabbling makes us ill-prepared to deal with foreign enemies. The Shogun and the Emperor will discuss how to protect our nation from foreign enemies. I believe it's our duty to see that their meeting proceeds in safety. We'll show the world the true value... ...of Shieikan's Ten-nen Rishin- style swordsmanship. I'm sure that the Shogunate will acknowledge our mettle! Toshi, I intend to selflessly serve our nation. Isami! There you go, good girl. Good, good girl. There we go. How's my girl? How is she? Eh? Here you are. Happy to see your dad, Tamako? Good, good girl. Tsune. Tsune. Yes. Yes. Do you think you could raise her by yourself? Yes. So you've made up your mind. Yeah. I'm joining the ronin and going to Kyoto. Congratulations. Congratulations. Thank you. I'll make both of you proud of me.

"The lumberjacks of Kiso..." "The lumberjacks of Kiso..." See it all go! "Mt. Ontake in Kiso..." What the hell...? Ouch! What's going on here? Yes, Commander Serizawa is... ...on another drunken rampage? No. He's quite upset that there's no room at the inn. What the hell's the matter with you? This is inexcusable! How dare you neglect lodging for Commander Serizawa, leader of our troop of ronin?! My apologies. We've managed to find a place for him. Please let me guide you there. No, forget it. Fan: "Samurai with spirit of Loyalty and Patriotism, Serizawa Kamo" No, forget it. Fan: "Samurai with spirit of Loyalty and Patriotism, Serizawa Kamo" Fan: "Samurai with spirit of Loyalty and Patriotism, Serizawa Kamo" Roughing it suits me just fine. Roughing it suits me just fine. But that wouldn't be right... Do you dare to make our Commander rough it? Aren't you in charge of finding a room for him? Cut your belly! Do seppuku! Please stop. And you are...? I'm Kondo Isami, Mr. Ikeda's assistant. I understand your distress. Please forgive us about tonight. If you're his assistant, then you're equally guilty! Do seppuku! What's with your attitude? My pupils and I have abandoned my dojo to travel to Kyoto and defend the Shogun. I couldn't slit my stomach over such a trifle. And you call yourself a samurai? I may have been a farmer, but I'm also the master of the Ten-nen Rishin dojo. The Ten-nen Rishin school? Ah, wait, Niimi... "Tengu group:" a radical anti-foreigner group from the Mito fief. We're a unit of the Tengu Group. It was all my fault. Please... Please forgive us. Wait... I was neglectful. Please forgive us. I will not move from here until you forgive us. Watch and learn. We shall see Isami's true spirit. Ouch! Ouch! I'm burning up! All right, you win, you win! Sorry to have kept you waiting. I was told about a mishap, our apologies. Finally come out of the woodwork, huh? The errors of my men are my errors as well. Please accept my apologies, and return to your camp. Please accept my apologies, and return to your camp. This is proof of your incompetence! To you Shogunate retainers, we're just a gang of starving ronin. Our world is crumbling about us because of your foolishness! It's crumbling! I am the loyal patriot named... ...Serizawa Kamo! And don't you forget it! Third year of the Bunkyu period (1863), Spring. The troop of ronin arrive at the capital, Kyoto. Flowers for sale! Flowers for sale! Hey gimme one of them! Is this meeting ever going to end? They could at least let us take off our sandals. How can they just make us wait like this? What could they be squabbling about in the main hall? Who knows...? All I know is that a Dewa ronin named Kiyokawa Hachiro's... ...been spouting off for over an hour. Who is this Kiyokawa Hachiro? He's the guy who organized the ronin troops. Indeed, our goal must be... ...to dedicate ourselves to the expulsion of all foreigners... ...for the sake of our divine Emperor and our noble nation. Therefore, I, Kiyokawa Hachiro, shall take command. What? What? We weren't told about that! We weren't told about that! Everyone! We weren't told about that! Though we have come to Kyoto to guard the Shogun and maintain law and order... ...if the Shogun were to defy the Emperor's command... ...and continue to deal with the foreigners... ...it will be our duty to rectify the Shogun's decision! I don't get it. What's this guy rambling about? We must thank the lmperial court for the dispensation... ...which permits us ronin to band together for the purpose of removing the foreigners. We have been ordered to return to Edo at once and undertake this task. Everyone! Let us immediately return to Edo... ...and endeavor to oust the foreigners! Serizawa... Do you understand now? While you and your men were on your way from Edo... the situation has changed. What a load of crap! So you still don't get it. The ronin troops must return to Edo! Just a minute! What is it, Kondo? What about guarding the Shogun here in Kyoto? We're bowing out. We have come here to guard the Shogun during his visit. Now that we have arrived in Kyoto... ...we cannot follow you back without any confirmation from the Shogunate. Comrade Kondo! The chain of command is no longer an issue. Are we not all warriors who serve the nation by ridding it of foreign influences? Indeed, we are all united in that cause. Nonetheless, we must not act irrationally. If we were to leave now, I believe it would be tantamount to betraying the will of our ronin. And so, I, Kondo, and my eight men, are withdrawing from this group. And I, Serizawa, and my five men... ...will also withdraw. What? Hey, Kiyokawa... I may be a hungry wandering ronin... but I'm not a flip-flopper like you... ...for the Shogunate one minute, and running off foreigners the next. Dropping out, eh? Well, that's a pity. But know that if you leave us... ...we shall no longer be responsible for your livelihood. All who wish to withdraw should feel free to do so now. We ronin will be immediately departing for Edo. Everyone should make immediate preparations! So that leaves just thirteen of us. Bastard. That wiseass Kiyokawa tricked us. Someone will eventually chop him up. Right, Kon? "Bakufu:" the government, or Shogunate. The Tokugawa Bakufu is nothing but a bunch of wimps. They employ 80,000 retainers... ...yet they use starving ronin like us to guard the Shogun and keep the peace. They live in luxury, they don't do a damn thing... ...and hire us ronin to risk our lives for them. What a laugh. What a laugh. You got that right! I guess we've all gotten the short end of the stick. Don't you agree? So you're all staying here... what next? Serizawa, what are you going to do? What'll I do...? I'm a hardline Tengu group guy. Don't worry about me, I can take care of myself. We are determined to carry on with our initial task of guarding Kyoto. How upstanding. Upstanding indeed... What are you going to do, sucker an Osaka tycoon into funding you... ...and take on Choshu and Tosa with a legion of eight? I've got to hand it to you guys... Hey, kid! I know you're sincere, but you're nalve. I don't think that he is being nalve. We want nothing to do with Osaka tycoons. What do you plan to do then? We shall appeal to General Matsudaira, the military commissioner of Kyoto. We shall complete our mission no matter what happens. Whether it's lmperialist or Shogunate forces, the people behind the unrest in Kyoto... ...are doing it because they hope to profit from it. The Commissioner must have his hands full. Thus we will approach him, expressing our desire to help keep things peaceful... ...during the Shogun's visit to Kyoto. Hey, don't kid yourself. "Daimyo:" feudal lord. The guy's a Daimyo with Hey... wait. Are you serious? Very serious. As a former farmer who is now a swordsman, I have given up my life in Edo to be here. I am defeated, Kon... ...you're more than just a master of a country dojo... ...you're a great man. I've had it. How much longer are they going to make us wait? It's not like we're enjoying the suspense. If the answer's "no" then I wish they'd just tell us, for crying out loud. Their letter of request is proper, but they are ronin riffraff nobody's ever heard of. If we agree to this, they could potentially bring shame upon our Aizu fief. Let them in. This Kondo Isami is straightforwardly earnest. Could we not use them? Oh? Oh? The lmperialists of the Choshu fief... ...have gone overboard with their assassinations and violence. Even the Emperor is upset at them. And now we are offered a weapon with which to suppress them. I see, sir. I see, sir. If they get out of hand, disband them at once. Think of them as pet dogs, and attend to their appeal. We did it! This is great! "Shinsengumi:" lit. "newly chosen group" We've just been chosen... we're the Shinsengumi. And I'm the captain! Be silent when at this noble gate! My apologies. Sign: "Shinsengumi Quarters, Officially Authorized by Lord Matsudaira" Move! Out of the way! What? You can't use a sword? Then you can't join us. But... I'm second to none when it comes to reading, writing, and the abacus. Well, how good are you at killing men with your abacus? "Gion:" nearby town known for its shrines, festivals and teahouses. This is the Shinsengumi. Go apply at a clothing store or move to Gion. Okay, next! Please! Please! Move! You're just a townsman! Next! Good! Next! I implore you! I am no good with a sword, but please let me join. This is the sword that my dad bought for me. I want to be a samurai more than anything else. I will train in swordsmanship! I will endure all hardship! My name is Kawai Kisaburo, the son of a sake merchant of Okayama. I am unsurpassed in reading, writing, and the abacus! Truly I am! How can I return and face my father, who exhorted me to join you? I implore you! Come on, stand up. I won't. Not until you let me join. Yamanami, let's let him join. There you go...! Thank you very much! Thank you very much! Thank you very much! The emblem of the Shinsengumi... ...will be the single word "Makoto." Flag: "Makoto" (Verity) ...will be the single word "Makoto." Flag: "Makoto" (Verity) Flag: "Makoto" (Verity) Commanders: Serizawa Kamo, Kondo Isami, and Niimi Nishiki. Commanders: Serizawa Kamo, Kondo Isami, and Niimi Nishiki. Executive Officers: Yamanami Keisuke and Hijikata Toshizo. Staff Officers: Okita Soshi, Nagakura Shinpachi... ...Harada Sanosuke, Todo Heisuke, Hirayama Goro... ...lnoue Genzaburo, Hirama Yusuke, and Noguchi Kenji. Inspector: Yamazaki Susumu. Accountant: Kawai Kisaburo. We now announce our regulations. Deviations from the path of bushido are prohibited! Leaving this force is prohibited! Unauthorized use of group funds is prohibited! Private settlement of disputes between members are prohibited! Acting from personal motives is prohibited! Those who would violate any of these prohibitions... ...will be subject to seppuku! Seppuku for any of those? That's pretty stiff. Whoever it was that spoke, step forward. Seppuku is the highest honor that can be granted to a samurai. YOU, COME FORWARD! I apologize. If I ever violate the prohibitions, I shall gladly commit seppuku. You would not be capable of seppuku. As we are merciful, we will let you live, and return home. Go! Yes sir. Listen up! The mission of the Shinsengumi... ...is to stand against all anti- Shogunate forces... ...without regard for their home fief... ...and kill them all as soon as they're found. Miura! Miura! "Mibu:" town located in Shimotsuga District Damn those Mibu beasts! Kanji... who were they? Who were the men who killed my dear Miura? Please tell me... Please tell me! Oko, that was Kondo Isami of the Shinsengumi. Kondo... Isami. Please don't take that! Please, wait! That's our family treasure! I implore you! That's what you get for giving 10,000-ryo to the lmperialists... ...and not a penny to the Shinsengumi. Dear! It's the Mibu ronin! The Mibu wolves! Run! Move! Come on, slowpoke! Where're do you think you're going? Huh? Where? Where I wonder? Where do you think you're going?! Catch up with me later. "Shimabara:" the Kyoto red-light district. Off to Shimabara today? And then Yama-no-o in Gion. Let's go. Don't just stand there looking like morons! Continue your training! Go! Yes sir. One, two... One, two... One, two... Yes sir. One, two... One, two... One, two... Sheesh... Off to the teahouses this early? Let's do it! Hey, hey hey! Not today, not today! Go do it outside. Move it! You're always like this... If you get too fresh... ...l'll have to tell my husband. What do you mean? Is that a threat, or an excuse to escape me? I'm the virtuous wife of a clothing merchant, I merely came to collect on your bill. But who was it that took advantage of me, the first time we met? I'm not your toy, you know. Don't be so cold. You women are all the same. You know that I'm not going to pay up. And yet you come here every three days. If I get caught doing this... ...l'll never be able to go back to the store. If you can't go back, then you'll just have stay to here. I'm a delicate flower... Be more gentle. Whatever... We have completed today's patrol. Well done. Damn, it's hot! Oh... leaving already? I'm sorry things took so long. Have you completed your business with our Commander? As it happens, not quite yet. Mr. Kawai, help me out here. Mr. Serizawa and the others need to settle the bill for the summer robes we made for them. I can't just keep leaving here empty handed. Ei! Please leave. Well, please expedite the payment if you can. And thank you for your business. Bye... You shouldn't be talking with her! Can a commander do anything he wants? Can a commander do anything he wants? Mugging merchants, murdering on a whim... They're no better than burglars! They're no better than burglars! At this rate, they'll soon ruin the Shinsengumi. His unrestrained boozing is inexcusable. I'm going to kill them! I'm going to kill them! Wait! Leave this to me. I will have a talk with Serizawa. Hijikata... I want you to talk to Niimi about this. Can you stop the drinking? Please, you must stop drinking! Please, you must stop drinking! If I were able to stop, I wouldn't be so wretched. If I were able to stop, I wouldn't be so wretched. But... If I were able to stop, I wouldn't be so wretched. But... But... I hate booze. And yet, I can't live without it. A guy like you probably wouldn't understand. I'm better off dead. Such weakness is unbecoming in a man of your stature. Renounce drinking! A man like you can do it! I'm not worthy to be a commander. You don't have the luxury of indulging in self-pity. Lately, the Aizu clan has taken notice of your carousing. They are saying that the Shinsengumi are a gang of ronin riff-raff. They're trying to have us disbanded before we bring any more shame on the Shogunate. Are you aware of this? Sorry. We worked hard to build the Shinsegumi from the original thirteen. It would be a shame for it to come to naught, wouldn't it? Please be an example of our emblem, of our code of makoto. I will join you in a pledge to renounce alcohol! Serizawa! Please come to your senses. Kon... Why do you care so much about me? You're a fine samurai when you're not drinking! Kon... Commander...! We have news from Yama-no-o in Gion that Commander Niimi... ...in obedience to the regulations governing our forces... ...admitted committing numerous lawless acts... ...and then manfully atoned by committing seppuku! What?! Niimi... ...cut his belly? Damn! Stop! Stop! Commander! Commander! Commander! The troops have been called out! Commander! Commander! The troops have been called out! Commander! The troops have been called out! We've been ordered to guard the Shogun! Summer: The Incident at the Royal Gate Halt! What are you people?! We are the Shinsengumi of Mibu. Oh. The Mibu scum! We have the important task of expelling the Choshu clan from the lmperial court. We need no help from a motley gang of ronin. So get lost. Begone! What?! Shut up! What?! Shut up! Please wait. If you are of the Aizu clan, then you should know... ...that your own clan council granted us permission to operate. Councilor Tashiragi ordered us to come and help. How dare you call us Mibu scum?! Because of you do-nothing idiots... ...the Choshu bastards have misled the Emperor into supporting them. And they're using the Emperor... ...to overthrow the Shogunate! Apologize! Apologize! Serizawa! Serizawa! Shut up! Serizawa! If you're determined to not let us pass... ...then we'll use our swords to cut a path through you. Move! Out of our way! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Huh?! The Councilor! At the palace by day, and the south entrance by night... ...the hard work you do is much appreciated. Thanks to you, the Choshu samurai have fled from Kyoto. You've restored the peace. You've restored the peace. Enough, already... Where are the courtesans? Where are the courtesans? My apologies. I'll get them. Please drink. The seven officials that tried to kidnap the Emperor from the palace... ...have been driven out of Kyoto. Thanks to the Shinsengumi, the Shogunate has won a great victory. Aren't you glad that you didn't have to fight? That there was no battle? Hey... Are you implying that the Shinsengumi won because we didn't have to fight? Why, nothing of the sort... Why, nothing of the sort... Shut up! You're making fun of the Shinsengumi. Courtesan Miyuki... You're late, courtesan. Here. Pour me one. None for me thanks. I have decided to abstain. Have you made a vow of some kind? Well... you could say that. Hey, Kondo... You got somethin' to say? You should not speak in such a vulgar tone. If you make a scene here, people will laugh at you. If you're a samurai, you should know that. HEY! Don't you know that I'm Serizawa Kamo, the leader of the Shinsengumi? Well?! I see no leaders... no Daimyo here. Merely men... and women. You've got a mouth on you. What? You got something to say to me? I don't like the way you're looking at me! That goes for you too! And you! I'm the one that arranged for this banquet. Because of our latest victory, we Shinsengumi have been recognized by the Aizu fief. And for the first time, we've received a monetary reward. My farmer comrade Kondo here didn't want us to celebrate! But I made sure we could, to boost our morale! Well?! What's bothering you?! Answer me, Hijikata! "my robe reaches my Knees..." "my sleeves reach my wrists..." "At my hip..." "...is my sword... Ei! Ya! Toh!" "It cuts through iron!" That's stupid! You're plastered... What happened? What happened? Gimme water! Oume! Hold me... Hold me! Who's there?! I knew you'd come to kill me. I, Kondo Isami, humbly assume leadership of the entire force. All of you, resolutely applying the spirit of makoto... ...must strictly adhere to our regulations, in the service of keeping the peace in Kyoto. I want you all to exercise the most austere discipline. Commemorating this new direction for the Shinsengumi... ...Arakida Samanosuke, Echigo Saburo... ...and Matsui Ryuzaburo, are hereby declared... ...to have been exposed as spies for the Choshu fief. They are to be expelled. Stop them! Don't let them get away! Come with us! Display their heads at Senjo-gahara! Yamanami... Okita... You are witness to the decorum of our Commander. Let us become a Shinsengumi that none can accuse of wrongdoing. Oh... you poor thing, it's so cold! I'll give you this. Go roast it somewhere and eat it. Better hurry, you'll freeze to death. Thanks, thanks... Don't worry... it was just a beggar. On October 15th, the Shogun left Edo, on a mission to unite the nobles and samurai. This is his second trip to Kyoto since last year. The Emperor and the Shogun are cooperating, but the Court and the Shogunate are feuding. Miyabe, we have to act as soon as possible. Other than the Satsuma men, the Shogun's retainers in Kyoto are all cowards. I know. I know. No, perhaps we should wait a bit... Ever since we were chased out of Kyoto, we of the Choshu clan... ...have found it hard to return. It must be very hard on poor Yamazaki, out there in the cold. The lmperialists are getting more zealous. There's word that the Choshu group is swelling its ranks. How'd it go? I took him his favorite sugar candy, but he just gave me attitude. Wouldn't even talk to me. Yamanami, don't you think something's been bothering our Commander lately? Okita, the weight of responsibility for our troop rests solely on his shoulders. He doesn't have time for personal pleasures. He's a little too austere if you ask me. We've been in Kyoto for a year, and now even the Aizu clan relies on the Shinsengumi. And the Shogun is coming to Kyoto once again. When you're trying to lead a force of over a hundred men... ...there's no room for even the slightest error. I feel sorry for our Commander. He's shouldering quite a burden. All I do is sit in front of my abacus all day. It must be so scary out there for everyone, fighting every day. You dummy... If you're a samurai, you can't be scared to die. But one shouldn't die for nothing, right? Welcome back. Welcome back. Damn, it's cold! Go take a bath and warm up. Go take a bath and warm up. Thanks... Thanks! Once again, I failed tonight. There's this one suspicious character... ...but he's always a few steps ahead of me. Shit! I'll get him one of these days. Summer I can't bear this. Let's get out of here! Talk. Talk! Kill me! Just kill me! Asshole! Still don't want to talk, eh? You're too tough to be a real antiques merchant. Confess! What? The antiques merchant is Kodaka Shutaro of Oomi? Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Commander! He confessed! The palace! They're planning to burn the palace! Burn the palace? Burn the palace? They plan to wait for a windy night... ...then set fire to the palace and the mansions of Shogunate Daimyo. Then they'll kidnap the Emperor during the pandemonium, and take him to Choshu! This is bad. This is bad. Kyoto will be tumbled into chaos! They're gathering tonight to finalize their plan of attack. Shit... Tonight's the Gion festival. They'll just blend into the crowd! Where will they meet? Where will they meet? At lkeda Mercantile, at Senjo. Executive Officer... how many troops can we deploy? Excluding those in Osaka and the sick, about thirty! All right. We've no time to lose. Request additional troops from the Aizu clan. "Hour of the Dog:" Around 8 p.m. We will assault lkeda Mercantile at the hour of the dog. Woops, I'm so sorry. I wasn't paying attention. Not a problem, not a problem. That felt nice and cool. You must be more careful in the future. Welcome back. You're early today. Yeah... in this heat, door-to-door sales are murder. And on top of that, tonight's the Gion festival! Hurry it up... all right? Hurry it up... all right? Mr. Okita. Mr. Okita. Mr. Okita. Move it! Mr. Okita. Mr. Okita! What is it, for crying out loud? I'm busy! See me later. Do you have enough men? Do you have enough men? We're short. It's making me nervous. What about me? What about me? Idiot! This isn't a game! On the other hand, "a withered tree is the mountain's prosperity." You can come. You can come. Really? I'm on it! Lanterns: "Festival Lamp" You doing okay? Yeah... But it sure is hot tonight. Hello, Miyabe. Hello, Miyabe. Hey there. Miyabe, this is a letter from Katsura. Commander! Commander. We have word that between fourty and fifty men are meeting at Shikoku Mercantile. Shikoku Mercantile? Fifty men at Shikoku Mercantile. Thirty at lkeda Mercantile. There's still no reply from the Aizu about reinforcements. What's taking them so long? It's past the hour of the dog. We implore you, please deploy your soldiers! That's easier said than done. In this fief, there are all sorts of procedures that must be followed. Besides, we're short on guards because of the festival. The city will be in chaos! They're going to set fire to the palace! The councilor... please let me speak with the councilor! It's past the hour of the dog. We can't wait any longer. Commander, it'll be a disaster if we're late and miss them. We can't rely on the Aizu fief. He's back! It's no good, I couldn't persuade them. The councilor's still at Nijo Castle. You did your best. Toshi... Take twenty men and attack Shikoku Mercantile. And you? And you? I'll go to lkeda's with Okita and Yamanami. We're here on patrol. We're here on patrol. The Shinsengumi's here! It's the Shinsengumi! Don't panic! We've got them outnumbered. Kill them! Shit! We're trapped! I killed one... I killed one... Okita! You're... It's nothing! Okita... Commander! Shikoku Mercantile was a red herring. No one was there! Hang on! Todo! Todo! I'm fine. I'm fine. You'll be all right. Commander! The Aizu have finally deployed their soldiers! Please give this to "big brother" Okita for us. It'll make him strong again. Please let him eat it. Yeah, he's gotta! Thanks a lot. Now all of you, go home quietly. Okay? Why must we go? Why must we go? Come on, time for you to go Come on, time for you to go We want to see "big brother" Okita. Come on, time for you to go We want to see "big brother" Okita. We want to see "big brother" Okita. Okay, whatever... Thanks. Thanks. But I want to see him. Hey. I'm not sick, you know. You have to stay in bed, you've got a terrible fever. What if you throw up blood again? You dummy, that was the other guy's blood! Why don't you just go and fiddle with your abacus? Hey, how're you feeling? How are you? Hey hey, shouldn't you be lying down? It's okay, I'll be fine in a couple days. It's okay, I'll be fine in a couple days. Don't overtax yourself. The Shogunate has commended and rewarded us for foiling the lkeda Mercantile conspiracy. That's great. That's great. They've finally recognized us! This is your share. There's a share for you too, Kawai. Really? For me too? But I only killed one man. Your abacus-style swordplay impressed everyone! When Okita's feeling better, why don't we go to Shimabara and have a party? Good idea! Good idea! The reward was a fortune. We've got to party! Let's do it! Don't get cocky! Don't let your victory at lkeda Mercantile go to your heads. Now that everyone is watching us, we must be that much more prudent. Don't forget that each man of the Shinsengumi shoulders a heavy responsibility. Okita... I hear there's a doctor called Honmeido in Muromachi. Go see him. I don't like doctors. They're all quacks. Commander's orders. Vengeance for our comrades! Why? Why can't we hold a wake for them at headquarters? They were killed without even drawing their swords, right in front of our door. They don't deserve to be honored as members of our warrior force! But, sir...! But, sir...! Yamanami... Our Commander's wrath is justified. Commander... Our dead Shinsengumi comrades must be blaming themselves for their error. We should act in such a way that their deaths will not be in vain! What good will it do to punish the dead? Please... Grant them a comrade's funeral. Such "comrades" do not deserve our respect. They shall have an honorable funeral. A pyre for the dead. Toshi... Tell me, did I make a mistake? You were not wrong. I fear that if we let down our guard, even just a little, the Shinsengumi, and all of Kyoto... ...will be instantly devoured by some giant, unseen monster. Weakness cannot be tolerated, if we were to survive these fast changing times. We kill and kill again, and there seems to be no end to it. Do we just keep on killing? We do. We're not the sort that dies in bed. Take a deep breath. Doctor... How many more years will I live? Well, I can't say for certain, but... Two years. Two years? I've got two more years? I wish I could help you. But today's medicine cannot cure you. No, two years is ample for me. Dad. Hurry, hurry! The funeral fire's about to go out. Wow, that's beautiful. Here... They say that you'll have a long life if you drink sake as the funeral fire reflects upon it. Really? People who live in times of chaos often indulge in such wishful thinking. Pathetic, isn't it? Maybe I'll have three more years now. When I go, I want to go like that fire, with no regrets. I don't like fires. I get sad when they burn out. I've never felt my life to be as precious as it is now. The Hamaguri Gate Incident It's been burning for three days straight. The palace is surrounded with ashes. The men of Choshu are stubborn! They lost and retreated last year, but now they're back again. Why would they want to kidnap the Emperor? It's payback for the Shinsengumi's attack at lkeda Mercantile. They lost again and retreated. I'm glad they did, but why did they have to set fire to our homes? After all, we're innocent! That's right! It's all because the Shogun is a flake! We're always the ones who get hurt in the crossfire! That's right! Why did they have to do this? Unbelievable! We were backed by the Shogunate, we chased out the Choshu... ...and we won the day, and still over a hundred men have deserted! It's pitiful. It's pitiful. They're cowards, all of them! We've been relying on the unreliable Shogunate army. No fief rises to the occasion, despite the order to suppress the Choshu! The Shogunate no longer has the power to raise a great army. But why would they desert the Shinsengumi?! But why would they desert the Shinsengumi?! Yeah, why?! Yeah, why?! Harada... Everyone's sitting on the fence. Yeah, why?! lmperialist or Shogunate... which is more profitable? At least the Choshu are honest about where they stand. Lords and vassals, they're all pains in the ass. I'm thoroughly tired of it all. I'm more enthusiastic than ever! I resolved when I left Edo to live by the sword alone, vigorously. It's all just the beginning for me. You have defeated the army of Maki lzumi at Mt. Tennozan in Yamazaki... ...the last refuge of the Choshu forces; you are to be congratulated. Here is a reward from Lord Matsudaira to the Shinsengumi. We are indeed grateful. Moreover... ...it is his desire to make you a Shogunate vassal. Please accept this honor. I, Kondo Isami, am indeed honored... ...but I believe that I am better suited to be simply the leader of the Shinsegumi. What? I have a favor to ask instead. Anything for you. During our last deployment, I was struck by the fact... ...that there was no one in command capable of uniting the Shogunate and the various fiefs. The Elders, the Council, and officials in Edo... ...are oblivious to the critical situation in Kyoto. I agree... Our Lord is also concerned about this. Please send me as a messenger to Edo. We mustn't miss this opportunity to unify the lmperial Court and the Shogunate. If things remain as they are, the Choshu cannot be defeated. Therefore, I humbly request a letter of approval from the Lord of Aizu. I want to go to Edo as soon as possible. Edo Castle Edo Castle We implore the Shogun to go to Kyoto as soon as possible. We implore the Shogun to go to Kyoto as soon as possible. If his Lordship takes personal command of the army of suppression... ...all the fiefs will rally behind his banner, and do battle against the Choshu. I understand how you feel. But to be honest, we can't afford to send our Lord on another trip to Kyoto. But if you do not take action... ...the Choshu will rise again. Already, Satsuma has abandoned the Shogunate, and joined the Choshu. It is obvious that they will try to overthrow you. Councilor, you have no idea... ...of the gravity of the situation in Kyoto. Note: The Shogun would normally travel by palanquin. The Shogun must go there, even if it means going on horseback! Ah, Kondo, at last we meet. My name is Katsu Awa. Thank you for your efforts. I have read the petition from Aizu and your written report. I suppose you're here in Edo because you couldn't stand it anymore in Kyoto. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've heard much about your endeavors, Kondo. But Kondo, I must tell you this. The Shogunate is like a house with rotten timbers. Once the house starts collapsing, you can't repair it. Lord Awa! You are in the castle. Choose your words with care! It's always good to have at least one rascal who speaks frankly. Well, Kondo, don't you agree? Lord Awa... ...you are on the Shogunate council, yet you speak of it like an outsider. What will become of the Shogunate? No, what will become of Japan? Please tell me, frankly. Well... ...what will happen, will happen. The Shogunate has grown old and fragile. The time has come to pass power to someone new and fresh. I'll tell you what I wish for. I wish for an end to this pointless infighting. Kondo... Why don't you just disband the Shinsengumi? You're the only man who can do that. Who is responsible for all this bloodshed? No one rejoices in killing people. You... you are irresponsible! Commander! Commander... Commander... We have brought Master lto Kashitaro. Well, it's been quite some time. It's been a while, yes. I am grateful that you could come all this way. No problem. Yamanami told me about your situation. I came as fast as I could, because I wanted to hear more about the Kyoto situation. Kondo... I appreciate your effort, marching from place to place. Thank you very much. Ito... I will be straightforward with you. I need the assistance of both your scholarship and your sword. My assistance...? In these chaotic times, things are clear as mud. As a former farmer from Tama, all I know is the way of the sword. I have no academic education. Nevertheless, I want to fortify the Shinsengumi, and bring peace to our nation. I concur. At the rate we're going, foreigners will soon control Japan. We must bring peace to Kyoto, the home of our Emperor, no matter what. Ito, please come to Kyoto and join the Shinsengumi. You have become a man of high stature. Hey, what's this? I made this for you to wear when you came home. Tamako. Tamako! Strange... She's been waiting for you, calling out "Daddy, Daddy" every day. I guess she's forgotten her father. After all, I've been gone two years. You've done a great job raising her. I only lived for Tamako, and for news of you. I didn't think I'd live to see either of you again. I am so... so glad that you've returned! Tsune... When will you be leaving? In two or three days... but circumstances might require me to leave tomorrow. Tomorrow? I'll be back again. Darling... please don't die! I have been honored with the rank of Military Advisor to the Shinsengumi. I have been honored with the rank of Military Advisor to the Shinsengumi. I am aware of the importance and gravity of my responsibilities. My role is to bring a breath of fresh air to the Shinsengumi. A breath of fresh air? What do you mean by that? By fresh air, I mean introducing the Shinsengumi to philosophy. I don't get it at all! I don't get it at all! Me neither! Please explain yourself! All I am saying is, think before you kill. You can't kill when you're thinking! You're right... I don't think when I kill! Are you saying we shouldn't kill anyone? Are you saying we shouldn't kill anyone? What, no killing?! Are you saying we shouldn't kill anyone? What, no killing?! Everyone...! Why does the Shinsengumi kill lmperialists? How do these killings affect the future of our nation? Give it some thought. If you don't, then there will be no future for the Shinsengumi. That's right! That's right! I don't get it! I don't get it! What don't you understand? I don't get it! What don't you understand? What don't you understand? Master lto's hit the nail on the head! Master lto's hit the nail on the head! To kill warriors... Master lto's hit the nail on the head! To kill warriors... To kill warriors... ...that's the mission... ...that's the mission... ...of Shinsengumi! ...that's the mission... What's not to understand? Are you a spy from Choshu? Mr. Yamanami... Mr. Yamanami... What? What? Could I have a minute? Could I have a minute? See me later. Could I have a minute? Letter: "Father, please send me 50-ryo immediately." Excuse me... I just need to see the ledger for a second. So we have Yes. Good. Give me the 500-ryo. That's only Yes. Um... Where's the other 50-ryo? It's gone. It vanished. It was stolen! Commander... It's too much to make Kawai commit seppuku! He may just be an accountant, but anyone who violates our code must do seppuku. Seppuku, seppuku! These days, just about anything is reason enough for seppuku. I can't stomach it! Kawai was unaware that the money had been stolen. That's irrelevant; the fact is, the money is gone. Kawai is not the kind of man who'd misappropriate the money. Please trust me on this! Please trust me on this! Trust you? Then, Okita... ...are you saying that one of our Shinsengumi warriors is a thief? Wherever the truth lies, the missing 50-ryo is the responsibility of Accountant Kawai. I understand. I understand. That's why he's taking responsibility by asking his father for the 50-ryo to pay it back! A samurai takes responsibility by dying. Sure, Kawai is an enlisted soldier. But he's just an accountant, formerly a townsman! If he can pay it back, then no harm has been done to our force! And in any case, there is no regulation against soldiers borrowing money! So our accountant can take advantage of his position, as long as we don't find out? So rich kids can get away with anything? He's a bad example to our soldiers. He must commit seppuku. People have only one life to give! To give that life for ideals and principles is fine. But you're killing him over 50-ryo! Commander, a courier is speeding to Kawai's province. Please wait for the answer. Commander, please! Hijikata... Let's wait for ten days. Has... has the courier returned from my province yet? Has the courier returned? Why can't they wait? Why can't they wait until the Commander returns from spying on the Choshu? Has the courier returned? Has he...? Not yet. Today is the eleventh day... My dad... ...what happened to my dad? To my dad? Kawai... your time is up. Will I be beheaded? Or will it be seppuku? Do you know how to perform seppuku? Kawai Kisaburo is a soldier of the Shinsengumi. So it's seppuku... It's seppuku, then? Comrade Yamanami, please be his second. Comrade Kawai! Help me! Yamanami! Help me! DAD! Hello! I am a courier from Kawai Mercantile of Okayama! Why couldn't you have waited two or three more days... ...before making Kawai perform seppuku? Commander, you decided that we should wait ten days. I was acting in exact obedience to your decision. But... Are you saying that we should break our code? Are you, the Commander, going to break the code of the Shinsengumi? Hijikata... Must everything be bound by the code? Your compassion upsets the men! Everything I do is for the Shinsengumi! Welcome... Well... welcome back! I heard you went all the way to Choshu. You must be tired. Please come in. Please... I've been counting the days until your return. I look forward to serving you... starting today. I appreciate that. While you were gone, Mr. Hijikata bought my contract on your behalf. I was so happy. He sure is a nice man, isn't he? He said that you're very important to the troops. And that I should see to it that you get plenty of rest and relaxation. He thinks of you as a brother, after all. Oh... One moment please. Come now... Are you just going to stand there all day? Please, have some. Ah, sugar candy! Mr. Hijikata said you were fond of them. What's the matter? Nothing. It's just that I haven't had time to even think about sugar candy. Do you remember? Hmm? Three years ago... the night we first met. I remember. Ever since that night, I... ...have been in love with you. As the leader of the Shinsengumi... ...I was expecting you to be fearsome. Instead, you were gentle and manly. You have been so good to me since then... ...that now I can't bear to be apart from you. I'm the one who can't bear to be away. When I'm with you, I can forget everything. I feel like I can become myself again. I'm so happy you said that! You take care of me so well... ...it's like a dream. Do you have any family? Yes. A younger sister... She works as a maid for people we know. She's in Shimabara, too far away for me to look after her. We can take her in. Really?! Do you mean it?! Commander! Mr. Yamanami has deserted! Okita said he'd go get him, and went after him on horseback. Okita! Okita! Yamanami! Yamanami, please escape! Use this horse and flee! Now that you've seen me, I cannot escape. You're the one who said that life mustn't be taken so lightly. You'll be held responsible for letting me go. Yamanami... I have only two more years to live. Two years? I have consumption, which no doctor can cure. If I die with Mr. Kondo and Mr. Hijikata, as a Shinsengumi, I'll have no regrets. So please... please... you must flee! Okita... Let's go back together. Yamanami! Comrade Yamanami... tell me why you deserted. I hate being in the Shinsengumi. I just couldn't take it any more. Why? During these turbulent and historic times... ...to kill without reflection is the act of a mad dog. I didn't want to be a mad dog. We don't live in an age of reason. I used to like you, Commander Kondo. Once upon a time, warm blood flowed in your veins. But now, it's frozen. You're just like Hijikata. Criticism... hatred... curses... whatever... You don't lead our men with warm blood and tears... you must be cold-blooded. I see, you say this even though... ...you were responsible for Kawai's death? What do you mean by that? The missing 50-ryo was used to buy out your Shimabara woman's contract. Quite so. But our Commander had no knowledge of this. He is therefore completely without fault. Hijikata! Commander... Even you will commit seppuku if you violate the code. The code, the code, always you bring up the code! Our soldiers are human, not merely your puppets. Comrade Yamanami! And you too... ...are a puppet. Okita, if you would be so kind... Kondo... Don't get swallowed up by the times. Farewell. What happened? Is something troubling you again? Just forget it... Forget everything, and get some rest. Who are you? I'll kill you... I'll kill you! Oko! What are you doing?! Stop it, stop it! Stand... Stand aside! He's... he's a murderer! Have you lost your mind?! Drop that knife right now! My sister, he murdered my true love. He's murdered so many people! Sister, move aside! Move! I'm not moving! Oko... you'll have to kill me first! I'll kill you! Oko! Oko! Bitch! Bitch! Sister, you're such a stupid bitch! I hate them, the lmperialists, the Shogunate, the murderers... I hate them all! I hate this world! Oko! Isami... This is no time to grieve over the deaths of Kawai and Yamanami. With both Emperor and Shogun now dead, their dream of reconciliation is dead too. Satsuma and Choshu are plotting to use the new Emperor's ascension... ...to destroy the Shogunate. The Shogun's army is impotent. They don't stand a chance. Commander, such words are unbecoming of you! I'm stating a fact. Had the Shogunate been strong, they would have had no need for the Shinsengumi. But you already knew that. So why did you leave Tama to come here? The Shogunate is in chaos, a chaos that will infect the Shinsengumi! Are you talking about lto? Exactly! I didn't have the ability to properly ascertain his character. Commander... Toshi. I want to believe in people. Ito, are you a spy for the lmperialists? What? You took advantage of Kondo's candor to sow dissension within the Shinsengumi. Do not make wild accusations, Hijikata. I am merely teaching the soldiers the truth as I see it. You're the same as Kiyokawa Hachiro, infecting us with lmperialist ideas! Why you...! You are being insolent towards the Shinsengumi's Military Advisor. We've investigated your jaunts to the Satsuma fief. We know all about your activities! As Military Advisor, you must be held responsible for your actions. I will let Kondo adjudicate this matter. Letter: "Request for Secession" Are you deserting? Not at all. We merely wish to support the Shinsengumi in a different way. A different way? We will throw in our lot with the Satsuma and Choshu fiefs. We will uncover their secrets, and report them to the Shinsengumi. As you wish... Having received the Commander's approval, we, the fifteen of us, bid you farewell. Kondo, until we meet again... Todo! You too?! I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Bastards! Bastards! Wait! Bastards! Wait! Wait! Commander! Who are you? Who are you? Kondo Isami. Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! Master! We will... we will avenge you! We will defeat Kondo Isami! Cowards! New Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu reinstates Imperial rule. There's going to be a war! Choshu and Satsuma are going to attack! We have to run! Hurry up and get out of here! Kaori! Kaori! Are you all right? Uh, wait! Okita! Miss Kaori! I'm so glad to see you. How've you been? Are you okay? Yes. Okita, I hear you're leaving Kyoto and going to Fushimi. We're going to go as far as we can, to relatives in Ohmi. The time has come for us to part. I thank you for everything you've done for me. No... Miss Kaori. Thanks to that funeral sake, I'm going to live for a long time. Thank you. Don't be silly! Don't cry! That's right. When the war is over, we'll meet again, and drink more sake. I promise I'll come to see you. I will not die. Until then... They're coming! Okita! Oyuki. Oyuki, there you are. Oh, hello. The city's in a panic. What are you doing here? Did you hear from Oko? Yes. She's working in Edo. I see. Oyuki. Thank you for being kind to this unworthy man. Take this money, leave this place, and make something of your life. I don't want it. I'm not leaving. I won't be returning. The Aizu clan left for Osaka Castle with the Shogunate forces. The Shinsengumi have been ordered to pacify Fushimi. We're leaving Kyoto. My life... belongs to you. I'll stay with you until death. I don't regret my burning passion for you. I'll wait for you here, even if it kills me. Oyuki... You won't die. You won't! You will surely, surely return to me. I have... faith in you. This is to avenge Master lto! Sign: "Shinsengumi Headquarters" Please take it easy and rest up at Osaka Castle. I'm counting on you, Hijikata! Don't worry, leave everything to me! Commander! We pray for your swift recovery. The Battle of Toba and Fushimi Goddamn bullets! Hijikata, this is the end. I've lived for the sword alone. Let me charge them! Okita. The day of the sword is done! Please give my regards to Commander Kondo. CHARGE! Okita! The Satsuma and Choshu armies have raised the lmperial flag! The lmperial flag! That... That means we'll be considered to be rebels! We're not opposed to the Emperor! Damn! Satsuma and Choshu are the traitors that started the war! They've stripped the Shogun of all his power! Executive Officer! Executive Officer! The Shogun's gone by ship to Edo! So... Okita...! We'll rejoin our Commander in Edo. We shall rise again! How's Tamako? It was raining so hard, I left her at my uncle's. I'll go get her right away. She's really grown. I'm glad you're all doing well. You too. Please, come in. I can't, I have no time. Depend on your brother for advice. The rest is up to you. I'll be back soon! Take care of Tamako. Husband! Wait! Please wait! Please see Tamako before you leave! I came to bid you farewell, before we leave for Koshu with the Koyo suppression force. I'm glad that you came, really glad. Lord Awa... You found a way to elegantly remove the Shinsengumi from Edo. Kondo... You've given us military funds and cannons... ...you made me a junior elder, and now you're kindly giving me a place to die. But before I go, there is something I want to tell you. I do not like war. The Shogun has courageously relinquished power after 300 years in authority. But Choshu and Satsuma... ...have cast him in the role of traitor, and have dragged him into this war. To hell with the lmperialists! The only reason they support the Emperor is because they want power. I cannot forgive them for that. Never have I despised the lmperial court! But if we retreat now, the proud history of the Tokugawa clan will be besmirched! This is why I fight. Some say I'm living in the past, but this is what I call "makoto!" Banners: "Koyo Suppression Force" There it is... Tama, our home. This is the last time we'll see it. May we end with valor! Master Kondo! Master Hijikata! Please let us join you! We're the young men of Tama. We want to go with you! Please let us join the Koyo suppression force. Please! I appreciate your zeal, but I will not permit it. Why? Please let us help you! Please let us go with you! I'm begging you! Thank you. You boys have a future ahead of you. There are many things that you have yet to accomplish. Ten years from now... ...Japan will have changed a great deal, and Japan will need you. I beg you, work for that future. Signpost: "Shimofusa, Nagareyama" Signpost: "Shimofusa, Nagareyama" Men at Nagareyama headquarters, attend to my words! I am staff officer Arima Tota of the lmperial Army! Your headquarters are surrounded by the lmperial Army! The Shinsengumi, and their leader, Kondo Isami, must surrender immediately! Damnit! Damnit! The Koyo suppression force was defeated... ...and now we find ourselves surrounded here at Nagareyama! This is the end. We have to escape somehow! We'll all die in vain if we fight here. That's right! That's right! Let's escape! Let's escape! Isami, with the Aizu's help, we will rise again! Let's escape! I am going to go meet the lmperial messenger. Are you surrendering? Are you surrendering? You are the Commander of the Shinsengumi! I'll drag you with us if I have to! I'll drag you with us if I have to! I'm not going with you. I'm not going with you. Please! Escape with us! I'm not going with you. Please! Escape with us! Please! Escape with us! Commander! Commander! Escape with us! Commander! All of you must flee. This is my final command. Escape while I'm meeting with the messenger! Isami! Isami! Commander! Toshi, you've always been good to me. You did all the work that I didn't want to do. I was only able to lead because you were there for me. Thank you. Isami... I've trampled all over your warm heart. Forgive me! Forgive me! You still have the warm hands of a Tama farmer. From today on, each of you must do what you think is right. I... I don't want you to die! Toshi... Let me do what I want for once, won't you? Live a life full enough for the both of us! Halt! I am Shogunate junior elder... ...and former leader of the Shinsengumi: Kondo Isami Masanori. I am Arima Tota. The former Shogun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu... ...vacated Edo in the third month, thirteenth day. He has sworn allegiance to the Emperor... ...so why do you still resist? I was never under anyone's orders. Everything I did, I did voluntarily. Where is Hijikata Toshizo, and the rest of your men? They will not be handed over to the lmperial forces. How dare you! Bring Hijikata! Silence! Are you saying that you, Kondo Isami, are sacrificing yourself... ...so that the others could escape? Let my soldiers die in places of their own choosing. If a traitor must die, let it be me alone. As the Commander of the Shinsengumi, it is my responsibility to do so. Kill me! What? Beheading? Correct. Beheading befits Kondo. He's a traitor who defied the lmperial army. Please reconsider. Granted, he is our enemy. But he was the Commander of an army, and a samurai... ...so shouldn't he be granted the dignity of seppuku? Arima... it's out of the question to allow a traitor to commit seppuku. Tani... If the fortunes of war had been reversed... ...it would be we who would be called traitors, instead of Kondo. His was a life of unwavering "makoto." He is an extraordinary man. Let the past be the past. If possible... ...I want Kondo to be spared, so that he can serve the new Meiji government. Don't be absurd! Arima Tota, are you a staff officer of the lmperial Army... ...or are you a traitorous spy?! Choose your words with care! Oh yeah? Granted, Kondo lead a group that killed many of our finest comrades. I realize that his actions are punishable by death. And yet... Japan, in order to compete with foreign nations... ...must undergo a national rebuilding! We need all the exceptional men that we can get. Kondo is nothing but a murderer! He delayed the flowering of the new Meiji era. And what of the men he killed, who could have contributed to the new Meiji government?! He should be torn apart! I'll kill him myself! Control yourself! Sakamoto Ryoma, Nakaoka Shintaro...! Kondo murdered them all! No, he did not! Stop making a scapegoat out of him! This meeting is over. Kondo will lose his head! Behead him! Behead him! And so, "history is written by the victors." What? You are a General of the lmperial Army. You ought to understand the pain of others. Kondo... do you have any last words? I bade my wife farewell before leaving for Koshu. Though I humbly admit, I do regret that I did not see my daughter. Your feelings are very human. Without true emotions, the greatest warrior, or learned scholar, is nothing but a beast. I was an irresponsible father who neglected his family. But I wish that my daughter may live in an uneventful, peaceful world. Arima... These past six years have felt like a hundred. In these times, integrity is a crippling burden. Ironic, isn't it? Kondo... I believe that living with integrity... ...is the most important thing that one can do. You have hard times ahead of you. I've grown a beard. Since they're going to display my head somewhere... ...l'd like to look my best. Could you lend me your dagger? There... that's better. Farewell. Please proceed. I'll make it easier for you. Now! In the 4th year of the Keio period, on April 25, Kondo Isami was executed at Itabashi.
