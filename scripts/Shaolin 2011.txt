Warlords big and small side with foreigners at the expense of the people. Endless battles turn the land into hell on earth. Dengfeng, Henan. Amitabha. Amitabha. Brother, we have a live one here. Wake up! Wake up! Quickly! Don't let them escape! After them! Kill! Leave not one! Sir, eat it slowly. Eat it while it's hot. Thank you. Brother, yet another two hundred arrive. Jingkong, winter will come soon. Before the blizzards reach the mountain, we must build more shelters. We've already run out of wood and straw. What else do you want me to build with? Then take what we can out of our rooms and give it to these people. No way, I am deathly afraid of the cold. Look at these mantou, each day it gets smaller and smaller. So we needn't worry about freezing to death. Even before winter arrives, You will have already starved to death. After him! Search! Come out! Out of the way! Bring him out! - Stop! - Don't move! - You! Over here! - Stop! Don't move! - Don't move! - Don't move! Out of the way! Out of the way! You can't enter! Stop! You can't enter! Off the horse! Off the horse! Abbot, save me. Stinkin' monks! Commander Hou wants this man's head! Those who harbour him will share in his crime! I don't care who you are! You will not disturb these grounds! Come then. Hey! Hey! Save him and I'll send you to meet the Buddha. He's lost a lot of blood. Quickly, get the haemostatic powder. Yes, Abbot. Commander Hou arrives! These people have welcomed you with a display of their Shaolin kungfu. And you reply with guns? You are without manners. Commander Hou. Sir, please don't move. Abbot, you also don't move. He's nearing death. Help him, send him off. Amitabha. Buddha sends the fated. He has arrived, even if it is on his last breath, I must still help him. I ask sir to show compassion. No more meaningless deaths. If he doesn't die, I will not sleep easy. When the heart is removed from dread, dreams will no longer be troubled. With a benevolent heart, everywhere you go will be the Pure Land. The Pure Land? Abbot, you've stayed at Shaolin temple for far too long, you're confused. If I don't kill him, the fighting will continue. This will mean more killing. How will we reach the Pure Land then? Hou Jie. I admit defeat. Dengfeng City is already yours. If you spare me... I will give all my wealth and money to you. This... Is the gold I buried. Take it. If you don't kill me, I promise... I will never return. Thank you, Abbot. - Abbot! - Abbot! Sir! Sir! Defend the temple! Jingneng, Jingkong, stand down. A joyous arrival to a sad departure... The void in our world is once again felt. Would it not have been better to have not come and gone... To be free from happiness and sadness? Amitabha. Go. [ PLAQUE: The Source of All Martial Arts ] [ GRAFFITI : Empty words. ] Big brother, we are meeting with the foreigners tomorrow. What for? With proper funding, we can buy many machine guns and cannons. With it, we can take Zhengzhou. More guns is good, but useless if you dont fire them. Tell me, back at Shaolin, why didn't you fire? Compassion? Remember this, when you gain the upper hand... And you hesitate a moment too long... The one dead will be you. Next time... The next time I come across someone standing in Brother's way... I will definitely kill him. Then you've learned. Song Hu has already arrived. That's "Commander Song". Commander Song. The bastard, we fight without seeing any of his men. But come time to divide the spoils, he's here ever so quickly. Brother Hu, Dengfeng City has been taken. Huo Long is dead. For a nobody such as Huo Long... Why such a commotion? I would think you were still seeing the coffin off. We are in rememberance of the hundreds of brothers lost. Is that so? I am in your debt then. Against Huo Long, I didn't come, not to take advantage of you... If it weren't for these two bum legs... My horse and gun alone would have been enough to sort him out. Isn't that right, brother? Of course... What is a little loss on my part? I do not fret. I know that. You fret because of DengFeng City. Sister-in-law, it's been too long. Big brother. Shengnan, my darling girl. Greet your Uncle Song. Hello, Uncle Song. Hello, Nan-Nan. Sister, your Nan-nan is growing up to be very polite. More beautiful with age. With a daughter like her, be careful someone doesn't steal her away. It's decided, this child will be one of the family. My future daughter-in-law. When was this arranged? It doesn't matter, now is all the same. What? You disagree? If you disagree then let's fight. Good. Good gun. This is a fully automatic weapon. You can't buy it anywhere else. We want eighty units. How shall we do this? I wont take a penny if... General Hou supports our railway into Dengfeng. What did you say? I didn't hear properly. I said, I won't take a penny... If you support the building of our railway. I don't want the guns anymore. General. I don't want the guns anymore! Go, we head to the city's east. I believe, General Song Hu will show more interest. Mr Peter, please wait. Brother, this gun is truly marvellous. If Song Hu takes them... Show them out! Yes! Please. Next time, choose your words carefully when you speak to me. I don't take orders from you. Maybe when you're in my position, then we'll talk. You hear what I'm saying? Am I being clear enough? To use the lives of our countrymen and take the wealth of the people. Agreeing to build their railway... Is like opening the doors for them to take our land. The land of the Chinese belongs to the people of China. The foreigners' hands reach to take it... I will chop them all off. I hope Song Hu feels the same. I don't think you've listened to what I've said. These twenty years, I've called him brother. Do not badmouth him. And even if he is bad, it is not for you to say! I'm dizzy. What the hell are you doing? Eating biscuits. Biscuits? I'm eating noodles now. You've gone mad from hunger. What do you know? This is called having an idea. Idea? Having an idea? All you know is having ideas. You might be able to do that, But how about the people out there? What can they do? In times of famine, Judge Bao would feed the people with his own stores. What if we became masked avengers? We'll hit back at the warlords' armies. Brother, why don't we become masked avengers? Masked avengers? That's right, we'll become avengers that save people. Brother, that's against the rules. What are you afraid of? When the sky falls, Second Brother will hold it up. Brother is most generous, am I right? Of course. Of course! Of course! Little Miss, please don't run. - Quickly get up - Shengnan! Are you injured? What the hell are you doing? Did I not tell you to hold her hand!? - I'm sorry. - Why didn't you watch her!? - I'm sorry, Master. - You want to die!? - I'm sorry. - Papa. It doesn't hurt anymore, please don't be angry with her. I'm sorry, Master. I'm sorry. Leave us. - Does it hurt? - How does it feel? I'm not hurt Are there any injuries? - Let Papa see. - Papa. I made a drawing for you. [My daddy likes fighting] Is this Papa? Here, Papa will carry you. Hold on. Is Papa this mean? Big brother. Hold it for now, give it to me later. Ive personally delivered the marriage contract to Commander Song. He was very happy. Tomorrow night, Zhongyue Restaurant. Commander Song and wife, their son. Eating begins on the dot. I want to ask you a question. Since Song Hu already knows that I have Huo Long's gold... Why does he not ask me about it? He wants it all. Including DengFeng City. The one who strikes first wins. Then this is a good opportunity. Correct. Pick thirty of your finest and make preparations at the Zhongyue Restaurant. If he's not dead, I can't sleep. Big brother is wise. You want to kill Brother Song? It would be better if you didn't know. Be he is your brother. Please think again. Song Hu wants to take me down. Do you have any other solution? Spit it out now, it's not too late. Don't ask me, I don't know. I only have just one request... Don't let your daughter see it. Okay? A mouse? Brother, once we've stolen the rice, how about noodles next? Could you not call it "stealing"? We are "taking". Then how much are we "taking"? A bag we'll take, two bags we'll also take. Take however much we can. Jinghai. As masked avengers, we should leave a calling card. What should we use? How about your shiny head? You! Rice. Son, we have rice. Brother, its rice! The gods have opened their eyes. Thank you! Thank you! There's rice! Wait until I knock on the table... You take our daughter to the toilets. Papa, we are here to eat. Why do we need to go to the toilets? Listen to Papa now... And Papa will listen to you one day. Don't argue. Please. This way. Big Brother. Sister. Brother, you're late again. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Say hello. Hello, Uncle Song. Hello, Auntie. Wanshan, greet Uncle and Auntie. Uncle. Auntie. Well behaved. Really well behaved. Sirs. The Song family's Young Master was born in the year of the rabbit. The Hou family's Little Miss was born in the year of the sheep. A great match. Moreover, their dates of birth are very auspicious. Their five elements complimenting, fortunes will equally flourish. A match made in heaven. I dare say, this match will bring wealth and fortune to both families. Together till their hair turns grey. Thereafter, a hundred children and a thousand grandchildren. Great, great. Actually, as Buddhists we talk about fate being the cause of all things. Without fate, things do not converge. With fate, I believe... They would have come together sooner or later. So what are we waiting for? Quick, quick, quick! On with the wedding invitations! What are you so anxious about? How can I not be? If I were to lose such a wonderful daughter-in-law... Where would I find another one? Sirs, please exchange invitations. This betrothal is finalised. Agreed! Here. Congratulations! Congratulations! Big brother, I'll go settle the marriage rites. Brother, now that we are one family... I can speak my mind. Speak. How are we going to split Dengfeng City... Between the two of us? You tell me. Didn't we already settle this? One man, one half. It's all yours. From today on, Dengfeng City is not split between you and me. Only one person will have all the say. This is the most peaceful solution. What do you mean by this? Brother, I am getting old. I can't fight any more. Look at this leg, acting up again. It's time for me to retire. What's more, we're family now. Even if I give it to you today... In the future, will it not be left to my son? I've thought it through, I don't lose out. I've held this wine for many years but could never bring myself to open it. But today I will. Here, drink! Drink up and this matter is settled. Commander, we've received a secret message. Son, do you need to go pee? No need. Listen to me, ask your mother to take you to the toilets. Sister, take Shengnan as well. Let's go. Run. - Vice Wang. - Here! Leave us. Yes. [ NOTE: General, be careful. ] [ Hou Jie has an ambush ] You! You bastard! I've always treated you as my own brother. We conquered the world together. I would never have thought, today you wanted to kill me. - Is this true!? - Enough! Shengnan! Mama! Mama come quickly! Go already. Mama, save me! Mama. Mama! Mama. Mama. Shengnan! Get out of here, Shengnan! - Mama. - Run quickly! Shengnan! Run quickly! Run away, Shengnan! Don't look back! Shengnan... General! Papa! Papa! Shengnan! Stop! Commander! Run! Run! Shengnan! - Shengnan. - Papa. Over there! Kill! Shengnan, don't be afraid! Papa... Papa... Papa... Shengnan! Abbot! Sir! Sir! Please slow down! Save her! Abbot! Save her! Save her. Save her! Save her! Quick! Save her! Make way! Quickly! Silver needles! Guanyin paste! Hot water! Yes! Hurry! Shengnan, it'll be alright, it'll be alright. Shengnan, don't fall asleep. Wake up. Madam! Madam! You are not yet healed! You mustn't run! Please be careful. Shengnan Shengnan, be good. Shengnan. Say something to Papa, Say something to Papa. Shengnan, say something to Papa. Shengnan, say something. Why did you stop? You can't stop! Hurry up and save her! Do you want me to beg? Then I'll beg! Save her! Save her! Papa... Papa, don't scold them. And don't be angry with them. Papa will listen. Papa will listen! Papa will listen! I beg of you. Shengnan! - I beg of you. - Shengnan. Mama... Shengnan! She's going to be okay. - Mama, I missed you. - She's alright! Mama, let's go home together. Shengnan, wake up. Save her. I'm begging all of you. Only you can save her. Shengnan, wake up. Say something to Mama, Shengnan. Shengnan. Shengnan! Shengnan! She's alright. Say something to Papa, say something to Papa. - She's fine. - Shengnan! She can't be dead. Shengnan! Shengnan! Please wake up, you can't die. Shengnan can't die. Mama is here, look at Mama. Jinghai, receive the body. - Yes. - She can't be dead! I beg you! Save her! I beg you. I beg you. Save her. Quickly save her. Abbot have compassion, save her! If you can't save her, I'll tell you now! Don't none of you ever think of living! I will burn Shaolin temple to the ground! - Abbot, save her! - Enough! Amitabha. Have the gods not yet punished you enough!? It's your fault! She's not dead! I am full of regret! She is not dead. - If it wasn't for you... - She is fine. How can my daughter be dead!? She's not dead. Look! She's dead! She's not dead. - She can't see anything anymore! - She's not dead! She's not dead, you understand!? The one who should be dead is you! Shengnan. Mama is sorry. She can't be dead. She's not dead. Save her! You speak of compassion! How could you just watch her die!? Fine! Don't save her! I will kill each and every last one of you. I'll start with this damned old man. - Sir! - I'll kill you all! I'll kill you all! Sir! Kill you all! Sir! Restrain him! I'll kill you all! I'm going to kill you all... Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin... Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin... Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin... Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin... Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin... Leave Shaolin... This one doesn't count. Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin... Leave Shaolin... Is anyone there!? I set a trap for pigs, how come a man is here? What are you up to, covered in blood? I know you, you are that Hou Jie. You still want to kill people? When a man is without common sense is when they are worse than pigs. Given you're in this situation, best lie still. Don't howl. Relax a bit, I'll be back later. Amitabha. Hey, something to eat. Careful, it's hot. Cool on the outside, hot on the inside. Why has it come to this? Why? Your wife has left Shaolin. Your daughter's funeral has been left to you. Will it be a burial or cremation? The Abbot asked me to ask you. With burials, you can see them on holidays. But who can really see them? I guess you can dig them out but that's not easy either. I think cremation is more convenient. You can see them anytime and take them with you if you move. To where ever you go. I think cremation is better. What do you think? If its cremation... Then after you've finished your noodles, we'll go light the fire. Take all this and burn it! So you'd rather die than submit? At least I'll see Brother in the afterlife. Fire! When you were being hunted... It was Big Brother who saved you. Who would have thought... You'd repay his kindness with hatred! What is kindness? He didn't save me, he used me. I've known that for a long time now, he needed me. In battle, it was I that killed the most people. Was there a bit of land I didn't help him conquer? Then why did I betray Hou Jie? Answer correctly and I will spare you. Because... You are a dog! Wrong answer. I betrayed him, because he was afraid. With fear, comes defeat. He deserved this. Now begins my reign. You understand? The streets are filled with them, everywhere with wanted posters. Actually, it's the same whoever captures you. Anyway, I've to make rice for you again. Otherwise, I'll have made fifty thousand silvers now. [ WANTED: Hou Jie ] [ REWARD: Ten thousand silvers ] Eh? It's now a hundred thousand. Just kidding. Shaolin temple preaches compassion, I wouldn't do that to you. So what now? I don't want to leave. You can't treat this place as your home. What's this? Throwing a tantrum? Made up your mind? Want some help? - Brother. - Brother. There is suddenly a lot more rice in the kitchens. How did this happen? A lot more rice? Oh! Our prayers have been answered! Amitabha, amitabha, amitabha. Then you better ask Buddha... Why there are shadow men jumping about on the rooftops at night? Shadow men? How can there be shadow men at the temple? They came to steal the rice. It's to steal the rice back here, not steal the rice. All involved present to the training grounds after morning lessons for your punishment! Yes, Elder Brother. You again! What the hell do you want? Amitabha. Master. Abbot, I want to stay at Shaolin. That's not for you to decide. You are now wanted. Isn't so you can avoid capture? I've decided to become a monk. Shaolin will not become your battlefield, The decision is not yours to make. Return to whence you came. Did the Abbot not say once, "Buddha sends the fated"? Who says you are fated? Master. You'll only receive his body, you won't receive his heart. His sins are great. He is a warlord, Master. Master, a person like him will sully the name of Shaolin Temple. There is the essence of Buddha in all. We should not discriminate. Everything is empty, only fate is with substance. His heart is full of hatred and revenge, it will not receive the enlightenment. Well said. But we cannot deny the teachings of Buddha by closing the way. Nor can we, if we tried. Troublesome is the Bodhi, since understanding is confusing. The old ways are dying. I think, we should let him stay for now. The Abbot has dumped you on me again? But being in Shaolin is alright. Out there, it's a dog eat dog world. Wait outside. New Baldy, it's cold, wear this. Off to work! - Amitabha! - Morning. [ Asiatorrents Wan Sui! ] [ Malvinh Wan Sui! ] Mantous are here! Make way! Make way! Mantous are here! Line up! Line up! Thank you. Not so hard, eh? Not hard. Don't push, don't push. Plenty, plenty. Strike without the fist being seen. Not the way if it is. Practice to the Way. Actions are fluid. Move with feeling. Know the fine. Awaken to the Zen. Quickly bring the wooden container to hold the food! Okay. Hey. Have you practised before? What? - Kungfu - Kungfu? Truth is, when I was younger I trained for two years. But like you, my heart was not focused. So I worked in the kitchen. You want to learn, learn the Dharma. Dharma. Faced the wall for nine years. What was he refining? The heart. Without conflict, gained wisdom from every inch of his body. The thoughts from his hair is as the hair on our head. This level is called the Zen Wu. Let's practise together. Fists and heart as one. Elbows and knees as one. Shoulders and hips as one. Heart and mind as one. Mind and breath as one. Breath and strength as one. Practise to the Way. Actions are fluid. Move with feeling. Know the fine. Awaken to the Zen. Stay strong! They're hopping down, we're squatting down. Both ways build strength. Straighten up! Hold down this meridian. It'll be alright. You go now, go. For you. The weather is cold, why are you not inside resting? Precisely because it is cold, I am here practising. Are you cold? A little. Then practice with me. Okay. Abbot, his form is a bit off. From the heart it follows, from thoughts give rise. He is fine as he is. In practising martial arts, the vengeance in his heart is released. I do not practise martial arts, this I do not understand. Practising martial arts is Zen, cooking is also Zen. The principles are roughly the same. Wudao, the most important things in life are experience and practise. I've said it many times. Leave Shaolin Temple, go see the world outside. All I know is how to cook. Out there, I'm of no use. I'm not going. A piece of gold and a pile of dirt. Which has more use? I guess the piece of gold. And if I gave you a seed? Don't sell yourself short. Everyone is useful in their own way. Cao Man, you want us to help the foreigners build the railway. But you mustn't forget, Mangshan is the resting place of our ancestors. Disturb the soil and you break the Feng Shui. The ancestors will never agree to this! If you are really going to do it, I have nothing to say. I'm just worried that the foreigners are playing us... And making deals under the table. Cao Man, your betrayal of Hou... We don't care. He previously said, building the railway is just a cover. It's true intent is to take our land. Okay, okay, okay. Say no more. Henan Province's interests are not for one man to decide. But looking at Cao Man's attitude, it seems he's already made an agreement with the foreigners. There was no intention to hear us out. Go. Listen well. Standing in my way... Is not in your best interests. They are fortunate. But their families... Will die much more horrible deaths. Whether to become my friend or my enemy... Is for you to decide. Have a think. If there is money to be made, noone loses out. What do we do now? He hasn't returned yet. Don't cry, Aunt. Okay? Crying won't bring him back any sooner. What has happened? Master, our Daniel has been gone for over twenty days now. What should we do? [ NOTICE: Seeking all able men aged 16 to 40 for work on the Zhengsong railway. ] Cao Man is building a railway? Our family depends on him. Work quickly, on pain of death. You hear? Faster! Faster! Who's there!? What the hell are you up to? Commander Hou. Why did you kill so many people? It was... It was Commander Cao's orders. Leave. Leave! Hou Jie still lives! Hou Jie still lives! Let's go. Cao Man lied to us about building the railway. Who knew he was really digging for artifacts for the foreigners. Each one we found, we gave to them. In exchange for guns and cannons. He was worried it might leak it out, so he had them silenced. The Cao Villa still holds many of our brothers. At the end of tomorrow's work, they will all be killed. I am sorry. Go home. Quick! We're going. Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! Go have a look. How could this be!? In life till now, committed terrible crimes... All stemming from the greed of man. The actions of one... Today begs for the Buddha's forgiveness. Evil came to trouble the mind... Enough! Hereon will trouble no more. Shengnan! Corruption is without value... How can my daughter be dead!? Purity without excess. Forget bygones with one cut, one cut to sever all. Then will you understand all that is before you. From today on, this rite bestows the Three Jewels. The Buddha is realised. The Way is straightened. The monk is at peace. Hereon, you will be known by this order as Jingjue. Amitabha. Amitabha. Capture Hou Jie alive! Capture Hou Jie alive! Capture Hou Jie alive! Sir! It's Cao Man! I'm going to stop him! Get back here! Sit down! Calm down. He's come at a good time. Seize the moment, I will take him back. After sunset, go to Cao Villa. Rescue the people. You'll go? You are walking to your own death. If my life can be exchanged for countless others... What is death? Jingjue, you must be careful. Nobody move! - Nobody move! - Nobody move! Amitabha. Please Sir, release the meat cleaver. Continue committing sins and suffer disastrous consequences. That was for my daughter. Amitabha. That sure is my Big Brother. I knew you wouldn't die that easily. Brother, I thought of you terribly. Thought of me? If I don't die, you can't sleep, right? Don't be ridiculous. Nothing of the sort. Don't pretend. You're afraid I will take you down. Jingjue's actions are to give us an opportunity... So we can save lives. Your impulsiveness will ruin the plan. You understand!? You once taught me... Gain the upper hand and you hesitate a moment too long, the one dead will be you. I remembered. Pull back your men, I'll go with you. String the Abbot up. Do anything rash and I'll send him to the gods. No objections, everyone stand down. Come then. You promised to have these at Zhengzhou before dawn. Relax. With Cao's troops, noone will dare block our way. Remain vigilant. Make way! Make way! Get down! I'm talking to you! Get down! Quickly! Get in quickly! Big brother, isn't this place more beautiful than before? You bring me here... Wasn't just for me to praise you, was it? Of course not. I was wrong. Please forgive me. I hope that Brother will once again take me in. Conquering the world and achieving great things. Brother, look... This was all for your sake. This throne is yours. This imperial robe is also yours. Brother. Is money and power really that important to you? Listen to me. Don't become like me. Faking compassion? I was messing with you... To see how you would play along! I have a gift for you. Bring her out here! I found him for you, Sister. I spared her, so man and wife can be reunited. Get down! About face! You've suffered. I used to think I was powerful. I could take care of both of you. But instead, I destroyed us. Ready guns! Don't shoot! Raise arms! Fire! Fire! Guards stay! The rest follow me! Yes! Master, save us! Save us! You men! Go see what's happening! Yes! The artifacts are being stolen! After them! Out of my way! Hou Jie! Let go of her! Let go of her! Big brother... You're crying! Let her go! Your death alone... Won't satisfy me. You watched your daughter die... Now I want you to watch your wife die. Then I can be happy. You animal! Let her go! Let her go! Sister is very pretty. What a shame... You are a monk. Cao Man! Stop it! Commander! Shaolin monks have stolen the artifacts! Attacked the prison and released the prisoners! You deceived me. Kill him. Jingjue! Go! Go quickly. Go! Eldest brother! Go! Go! Go! Eldest brother! Go! Go! Eldest brother! Eldest brother! Eldest brother! Eldest brother! You won't listen to my orders!? Go! Go! Go! We'll escort the villagers first! What do you want? Back inside! Abbot. Get back inside. Hey! Little monk, don't force me. I warn you to go back inside now. I don't want to kill children. Sir, please show compassion. Let us save the Abbot. You will attain wealth and happiness. Sir, Abbot always said... A brave man is one who knows to return after having lost his way. Put it down and go home. I'm sure your family is waiting for you. Insolence! Want to rebel? Catch them! Amitabha. I don't want to fight! I don't know kungfu! Amitabha. Stop fighting! Don't want to fight anymore! I'll fight you with my life! Abbot! Are you hurt? Uncle! Toss them like you were frying vegetables! Uncle! Beat them like you were kneading dough! Uncle! Great! - Abbot! - Abbot! Are you alright? We must get inside quickly. - Okay. - Go. It's them! Huzi! Mother! Father! Jingneng's sacrifice was not in vain. Don't be too attached. Sirs and Madams, please ready and pack your things. We are leaving Shaolin Temple. I know you are scared. But I am not. Because my loved ones are gone, my family is already lost. Who wouldn't be scared? These few days... I felt just like you... Shaolin Temple is a happy place. It has become our home. Shaolin Temple might... Meet its end today. But the spirit of Shaolin... Every flower and blade of grass... Its beams and columns, its bricks and tiles... Will forever stay in our hearts. The spirit of Shaolin... Taught me to persevere and show courage. To never abandon hope. I ask you all to live your lives as best you can. I have a favour to ask of you. What? You lead them out of here. No, no, no. I have never left Shaolin Temple. No, no, no. I'm scared. You're scared? Look at them. They need you. They are more scared than you. I... Let me think... Fine. I'll go. We must distract them. We must escort the villagers up the mountain. Jinghai, take the Abbot first. Jingkong, you lead. I'll catch up. - Move quickly! - I'll fight them with my life! Quickly! Move quickly! Go quickly! You bastards! Want to destroy Shaolin!? I'll destroy you! Cao Man, wake up already. You must know, you've always had more than you need. Put it down, discontinue this path. We are in a war, it has always been like this. Don't be like me. I've come to realise my past crimes. It's time to stop. Could we not fight? What do you think? I yield. Shaolin Temple? Shaolin Temple will not be dishonoured. Buddha is compassionate. Madam! You can't leave! It's dangerous outside! Abbot! My child is missing! My child is missing! Mama! Brother. - Brother! - Brother! Quick! Quick! Brother... Brother! - Brother! - Jinghai... Brother! Amitabha. - Brother! - Brother! Brother! - Brother! - Brother! I will stay behind! You all must deliver the villagers safely! Abbot! It's time you woke up... Hold onto me! Amitabha. Evil is borne from the heart. Repent. Why? Uncle... The temple is gone. It's okay. Shaolin Temple is in our hearts. It will never be burnt down. Life follows fate. Fate follows life. From which we can live at ease. Here. Hereon, she will keep you company. You won't go? Cao Man is here. His mistakes are also mine. Only I can help him. You've really changed. I know... We can't be together again. But... I am really happy for you.
