The two young boys, previously listed as 'missing', are in police custody. The boys claimed their home was being bulldozed by a mining company.

You need a new shin. - It goes well with your shoes. - It don't fit me. You look handsome. You look like new boy now, see? So how's Jubi? Yeah, Jubi's alright - yarning up, sitting round the campfire. Jubi teach me to walk across the desert - me and Kalmain. If it wasn't for him... me and Kalmain would've been dead. Mum, I just want you, me, Jubi to be back together. Aye, Mum? What were you thinking, sweetheart? Come on, let's go. Well, I'm still doing this course, Pete. Hospitality. Ah, hospitality didn't work out so well. I'm doing a different course - beautician course. What about our barra shack, our cafe? Well, it's an amazing dream, Pete, but... I've got an even better idea. Let's go to Perth. It's a big city with traffic lights, proper houses, big shopping centres. I can go shopping there. Hey, we both can go shopping. What about Jubi - he comin? Jubi, he'll be right where he is. Stop the car. Stop the car! Stop the car, Mum. Stop the car! - Stop the car, Dave. - What?! - Stop the bloody car! - Stop the car! - What is it now? - Easy, right? I wanna go back to Jubi. I hated leaving you. You know that, aye? You was here the whole time. Why didn't you call me, come for a visit, aye? Listen, Pete, I can take us to Perth, get us a nice house, give us a proper life. You can have everything you want, any toys. New bike, video games - anything. Jubi don't need all that. He got feeling for country. Every day you was gone, he look after me with his old ways, stories... - He'll be fine with his old ways. - His old ways saved my life. But, sweetheart, I wanna live in the city. I need you to come with me... please? You go be a beautician in the city. That's what you want, aye? That'll make you happy. It's OK, Mum - you got your dreams, I got my dreams. I'm sorry. Drop me back into town, aye? Jubi! I missed you, Jubi. Oh! I missed you, Jubi. I missed you, Jubi. Which way are we going now? Go back country. Country. Yeah, go back country.
