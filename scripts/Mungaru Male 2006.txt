Your father's story is totally different. What must be so great in it? Your father directly proposed me saying 'l Love you'. And did you agree instantly? Yes without a second thought l agreed. Oh! God! There! You have done the grave mistake. You do not have any taste, mummy. He must have just tried to flirt with you. Did you really have to agree? Will any sensible person marry such a foolish man, mother? You Donkey! Kamala, tell him if he touches my car once again l will not keep quiet. Now, what has gone wrong that you are shouting like this? The whole street is stinking. Ask him from which gutter he had come out and had driven my car? At his age l could not afford even a cycle. And he wants a car worth 95 Iakhs to roam in the streets. l have 15 offices. Fifteen! Ask your son whether he knows the address of at least one office. He can wander in the streets but cannot come to the office. Just because his father is there to earn money. He is very calm. Did you see his 12th standard marks sheet, Kamala? His marks are like the telephone numbers. 2, 1 , O, 5. Even after appearing three times.. ..for the exams he does not have the fortune to pass. The juice is over. Now feed him warm milk in a feeding bottle. Let him drink, poor baby. Mother! Ask him for the opener. Kamala, from tomorrow he should be in the office. Otherwise l will not keep quiet. Give that. You are not short of these types of traits. Still not matured in life. And you try to threaten holding a bottle in hand. Bottle! lf l had not done that much. You husband would have been still standing and screaming here. When will he realize that l have grown up? Then what happened to your story? Which story? That girl's, who helped you out of the gutter. Oh! That story! - My car is fully spoiled. Coming. Hey! What are you looking? Wash it. l liked that watch very much and now l have lost it. Will you please see if you have one more piece? No Madam, l would have surely given if l had an extra piece. Okay, thank you. May l help you? Yes. You should help. Am sure God will bless you. l am searching for a girl. What? A girl? This girl l am searching had purchased this watch.. ..from your shop and the bill is here. Who is this girl? Tell me if you know her name, her caste, her community or her address. And if at all l meet her l will see that she never forgets me. l think l have l fallen slightly in love with her. Sorry sir, thousands of people come here. l do not know whom you are talking about. You have not helped me in anyway for me to thank you. And l doubt you will be blessed. 98.3 FM. You are listening to your favorite radio station, Radio Mirchi, 98.3. lt is Hot! You call to hear your songs to 989801 . l will play your favorite song. l, Ratna Srivatsav am waiting your call. Now, let us see who is our next caller. Hello! Who is on the line? What is in the name? Just listen to my story and help me out. l am in a great trouble. Tell me your problem. We will solve it instantly. l saw a girl, today. And just looking at her l lost my body balance and fell into a gutter. Hey! Listen to that. - Oh! My God! And then? Maybe l would have anyhow survived.. ..if l have seen her and walked away. But, she helped me and saved my life. From that moment l have Iost my sanity. Tell me where did this happen? There is mall in M. G. Road meant only for girls. ln the drainage opposite to that. What an odor it was? Okay, okay. What should we do now? Nothing. Just tell that great soul to come near this great gutter. l will be waiting here. - Okay. Tell her this Pritam can wait all his life.. ..with the watch she left behind. Okay. Okay. And if she is listening to this program. She will surely come, Pritam. You do not worry. Okay? l hope so. As you always give this answer to people who call you. Forget that. Play a song for that girl, now. Okay. The girl who has helped Pritam out of the gutter. Please go near the spot. Please meet him. All the best, Pritam. A beautiful track for Pritam's Iove and confusion. ''Once, only once come in front of me.'' ''Once, only once come in front of me.'' ''l have filled you in my eyes and soul.'' ''l had bought you from you.'' ''lt's your image that fills my imagination.'' ''You are in me and my senses.'' ''Once, only once come in front of me.'' ''From your one appearance.''

''Once, only once come in front of me.'' Hey! Get up from there! - Give way! Hey! Get up from there! Give way! - Hey! Mister Get up from there. Hello! - Hello, Sir. Hello! - Why are you here, sir? Because l am this fool's father. ls it, sir? Do not disgrace me in the public, sir. Stand up, sir. Sir, you have still not matured to look out for a girl. We are there to do that job. Now, get up, sir. Get up, sir. Hey! Get up! Take him along with you. Come soon. Hey, let go of me. Oh! Leave my hand. Stand properly. Let me see. Oh! He has already left. Are you mad? Let us go. ln the morning that fool's face was covered with filth.. ..and l could not see his face. Now, at least we could see his face from far. Forget, let us at least see his car. Come. Will you come with me? Or should l go from here? Please! - Come! My handsome son! See who the girl is. Tomorrow he is coming with me to Madikeri. l will ask him about the girl. Till then have some patience. l heard it is raining heavily in Madikeri. Be careful that your son does not fall sick. Tell Colonel that l am sorry that l could make it there. What is it mother that makes you look so happy? Did father talk about divorce? No Pritu, but can l cry hearing your story? Son is grown up. Is in Iove? Likes a girl. Not bothered of searching for the girl. Get him married and play with grandchildren.. ..and see the generation grow. No one is taking any responsibility. Forget that. Will l meet that girl again, mummy? lf it is written in your destiny. You will surely meet her. - Destiny? lf just talking about my destiny the car can break down. l do not know with what Iuck l am born? l am sure l will not meet that girl. When your father said l Love you to me. The city bus we were traveling met with an accident and fell down. This is not very great incident compared to that. First, go and change the wheel. Marrying father is your biggest accident. l do not know what else l have to do with these hands. Forget them, Pritu. Pritu! Catch! Give the kerchief, sir. What kerchief? Why? Do you know Nandini? How? This is for the first time l am coming across.. ..a person speaking so perfect Kannada. Hello! Give me the kerchief, sir. Heavy rains. Is falling. Chilly weather. And it hurts very much if beaten. You are still a child. Mama's boy. Go! Sir, you tell me whether to Iaugh or cry looking at you. That kerchief. You stupid! Hey! Who is Mama's boy, now? Mother India looks ready to beat me. Oh! God! What has happened to you? Mom, l met that girl again. Went searching and just missed her. My fate. You just shut your mouth and come with me. lt is raining heavily, come inside, Pritu. You ladies are meeting after many years. And if you do not talk nonstop it is an insult to womanhood. When you both embrace each other and shed tears. What should l do standing there, mummy? Pritu, listen to me. What s heavy rain it is in your area, Babli? Oh! You look just the same. Not changed a bit. And you are not less. You look healthy and strong. Where has your son gone? Gone to look around. He will come. Show me that. No, that does not suit your face. Pack this. - Yes, ma'am. You look so beautiful and.. ..l did not think that you would have such dull taste. Could you please mind your own business? Why do you want all this? Sir, will you please give some oil or mud to smear on my face. lf my face is clean people do not recognize me. What do you tell? Nonsense! Do you know who are Pritam and Nandini? That is the name of our grandchildren. lf it is a grandson then it will be my name Pritam and.. ..if it is a granddaughter then it is your name Nandini. Are two grandchildren enough? Who the hell are you? l am the same fool who fell into the gutter looking at you. These two things are the witness for the condition l am. Oh! My God! Oh! My God! That! Was that you? FM song. Oil on the face. l never thought l would meet you. Even l never thought. What luck it is! lf any one meets unconsciously off and on. They are destined to marry each other. What? - Yes. We should not delay in love. The climate and monsoon is super. Are you from Bangalore? Yes. My Father's name is Jaywant. Has made lot of properties. Only son. My mother is very good. Always tells that she is ready to.. ..give her life for the future daughter-in-law. ln all l have a great family background. Hey! Listen! Listen! Look, l do not want your family background. You are very beautiful and that is enough. lf you have any problem l can get adjusted sincerely.. ..and lead a good life with you. Do you know any good mental hospital? lt is like a mother's house to me. But l have not been there since long as l was busy. Please take some time off your work and go there to scan.. ..whether you have a brain inside your head or not. And if you talk like a Ioose character here. You will be thrashed to death. Got it? Listen! l will never search for you again. And if at all l meet you by Iuck, l will marry you. ''First shower! What is your magic.'' ''Of your raindrops.'' ''The line of clouds in the sky.'' ''Like the wreath of love.'' ''ln the shower of rain.'' ''Love has blossomed.'' ''ln which shell the water drop.'' ''Has turned into a pearl.'' ''Which seedling will grow.'' ''Cannot comprehend.'' ''Dear, l was waiting for you.. ..but you betrayed me.'' Hello! Excuse me! Will you please pull that rope? What is this Boss? l am in a mood to sing and you are telling me to pull the rope. How could you show me the rope at this age? l do not know what else l have to do with this hand. Very Bad! Lift it! Lift it! Look if anything is wrong with him. He looks fine. - Nothing is wrong with him. He has got a good physique. Babli, he is my son, Pritam. Do you remember, Pritu? When you came to Delhi with you parents. l tried to bathe you how you thumped on my head with the mug. He was a kid then. How can he remember that? That is true. Oh! Yes! You never used to wear your shorts as a kid. Look, how he has grown up now. Pritu, she is my daughter, Nandini. Hey! l am so sorry! So sorry! lt is okay. It is all right, come. No problem as it's you.. ..who saw me in this state of undress. Take the coffee. Let us drink. So, at last we meet again. Sit down. Let us exchange a few words like civilized people. Take your watch. And l know that you are having my watch. So please return it. ls this any exchange offer? l will not return your watch. What do they call it? Yes! It is like a token of love. So? You will not return my watch. Listen, in spite of being so verbal in my feelings about love. Try to show some mercy on me. l know how to take my watch from you. Oh! l say it is really difficult. lt is very difficult to win over a girl. Oh! Listen! This is really an injustice. You are embarrassing me. At morning in the market you were giving big talks.. ..that you will do this and that. l even remember you telling that you will bind me.. ..the matrimonial thread if you meet me again. So! At last you have come to the point. Listen, you sit down and let us decide the matter coolly. lt is not me who ought to decide this. But my father. You take his consent and then l will be ready. You mean my father-in-law? Tell me where is my father-in-law? l thought l am very fast. But you are faster than me. How many times to tell you? Tell me how many times should l tell you. Were you'll waiting for the donkeys? Why can't you water the garden daily? The motor broke down, sir. What if it rains? Hold the umbrella and water the plants. Should l put some ice, sir? Next time if l see the withered flowers in the garden.. ..l will shoot all of you. Get out! Go! Okay, sir. Come on! Come on! Matter is serious. Water the whole garden. Yes. l get angry when there is no discipline and goal in life. When a person is not adventurous l cannot tolerate him. l just ignore him and drive him away. l am also little bit like you, uncle. Discipline is important to me. When the President was felicitating me with bravery award. His shirt button had come off. l told him that his button is open before receiving the award. Poor fellow had to button it up and then hand over the award. By then the media wrote about the Colonel. Subaiyya is mad, eccentric. But l did not give a damn. Will you please stop biting your nail. Whisky? Is beer okay, then? What is this, Uncle? What is your age and what is mine. Being elder to me how could you encourage me to drink? l am a decent guy. You don't want it? Okay. That is good. A person should be like that. Should speak out the mind not act. l like such people. So? Do you like me, uncle? You are really great. You liked me instantly. ln case if l tell you that l would like to marry your daughter,.. ..l am sure you would not slap me. lsn't it, Uncle? Yes, not a problem. l feel you have become too great. l think somewhere there is a problem. But l can't detect where is the problem lies. Nandu! Father! l am sorry. You know before l got retired from my service. There was a bomb blast just close to me. And l lost my hearing ability. Now, without these hearing aids l cannot hear anything. Sir, do l have to repeat everything from the beginning. Yes, tell me. He is our Kamala daughter's son. What? - Yes. Kamala daughter's? - Yes. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Young man, you have a fabulous mother. Come on. Year's back it was your mother who got Babli and.. ..me married. Today, she has come a week early to attend.. ..my daughter's marriage. What did you say? Marriage? Yes. My daughter Nandini's wedding. After coming here to attend Nandini's marriage.. ..he is asking whose marriage it is. Didn't you tell him that? He does not like attending marriage functions. Babli, when l ask him to accompany me to any marriage. He always refuses. So l brought him along without informing him. You mother and son duo are perfect. Now, enough of drinking. - Okay. Come let us go for dinner. Come on! Young man! Please, come. Hello, Mummy! Hello Pritu, where are you? Sorry mother, l am going back. You promised to be here for a week. l am sorry, mummy. You are done with the marriage program. l will come to take you back after that. Pritu! - Aunt, can l talk? Pritu, Nandini wants to speak to you. Hi! Handsome! How are you? Isn't the monsoon super? Look, l am sorry. l did not know that you were getting married. And If l have hurt your feelings. Please do forgive me. l had high opinion for you. But did not know that you would act like a frightened kitten. You told if we meet again you would surely marry me. And when l have started thinking that if at all.. ..l would marry l should marry a man like you. You left the arena and ran away. l am waiting here with my bag packed to elope with you any moment. But nothing like that materialized. l will be waiting for you. Come and take me with you. After selecting the names of our grandchildren. How could you run away like this? lsn't what you are doing a shame to the whole mankind? Hello! Hello! Hello! He says she held his hand and helped him out. Listen, just because the girl held his hand he got a shock ..he would have got died of short circuit there. Young man, if you love somebody try to attain her not lose her. Tell me who she is. l do not mind kidnapping her and.. ..getting her married to you. Do you mean it, uncle? Definitely. Uncle, your words are enough for me. Let your blessings always be with me. l will immediately tie this watch on that girl's hand. lf l do that now, it will be easy when l wed her. Go ahead. - l will, Uncle. You were left to support him. Uncle, if you support me. l promise on her father and.. ..mother l will not abandon her. What do you say, aunt Babli? You have our full support your uncle's and mine in.. ..whatever you do. Thank you, Aunt. Aunt, you are really too good than Uncle. Let me have your blessings also. l thought of giving that girl's and my name to our grandchildren. But now l have decided to name them as.. But l need your support like this from the day.. ..l make the girl elope with me. To the day of christening of my grandchildren. And if you ever give up your support.. ..l will surely become like this Devdas. Devdas? This Hare? Wonderful comedy! This is not a comedy, Uncle. But a big tragedy. This Devdas had an affair with a beautiful elephant in the forest. They were head over heels in love with each other. When they were about to exchange the marriage vows. An ant came by and the elephant eloped with him and got married. They even have three children now. With that tragedy he became heartbroken and started drinking. He was on the road playing. Seeing him l carried him home. Sir! Sir! Sir! It is swollen all over. There is bandage on the head. You should see that. Babli, ask him to tell the matter clearly. Or else l will shoot him. Who has been bandaged? Everyone. Everyone means whom? Jolly, sir. Jolly? Yes sir. People are talking of the fight this sir and.. ..Jolly had on the highway. Sir! Sir! Keep quiet. - No one is there. Jolly! You rascal come out. Who is this Jolly? What is happening? He is a local. Ran away from the military. He is harassing Nandini by writing her love letters. He says he will not let Nandini marry anyone. And if she marries any one he has threatened to kill.. ..the man and will go to the jail. Sir! Sir! There is no one in. Come sir. Come sir. Leave me! - Sir! Sir! Leave! Who are you to stop me? There is no one in. Come sir. Come sir. He survived today. If he comes here let me know. l will kill him. - Yes Sir. Devdas, the old man is quiet only on the surface. He can even murder anyone if violence is provoked. We have to be very careful in future. Come let us go. ''Keep my heart with care.'' What is this? lt was raining very heavily and l was feeling very cold. Actually this is not the age to fall sound asleep in this season. So l came out for a round. Actually l wanted to deeply discuss about our eloping from here. Are you free? Look, l was simply joking with you. So do not take anything seriously. How can l forget that? Who started this drama? You or me? l was going on my way. You called me. l came back. Just because you tell me to forget it. How can l spend the loneliness in this monsoon? l find it very difficult. Look, l do not know anything. l will tie this sari here. And when you feel like eloping with me. Come down the sari in a filmi style. l will be waiting down in my car. We will run away from here. Tomorrow we should not face any problems at the last moment. So, l am doing all the preparations, today. Why don't you do a trial now? Do you know the extent of my father anger? You should not talk about great.. ..people like him at this time of night. l have great respect to the man who is going to be my father-in-law. lf you behave foolishly like this. l will go and tell him. And you will have to bear the consequences. You are trying to frighten me. Listen.. ..l will take care of your father. You decide about our eloping. Okay? Now go and have a good night sleep. Bye! l will come in your dream, tonight. We will talk. Aunt, where is Pritam? l don't know. Mother! Mother! What? - Where is Pritam? l do not know, dear. Rama! Rama! Where is Pritam? He is gone with Master to the fields. Master had gun in his hands. Father! Father! Father! Hi! Uncle! Fire! Get ready. Survived! lf the bullet have brushed some other place. Oh! God! Father, are you not in your senses. Early in the morning you are playing. Don't you have any other work to do? He is such a brave young man. l always thought of making .. ..brave man like him hold a target while l could do the shooting. No one dared to stand. They would either run or fall down. He is only real man.. ..l met so far. A real man. He should have been in the army. Nandini! Young man! Young man! Young man! Why did you come running? Did you fear that l would die? Young man! Let go of my hands. Did you come to save me? Did you fear.. ..your father would shoot me if l tell him everything? Young man! - l have not told anything to your father. Leave my hands or l will call father. How dare you hold my hands even when father is approaching us? Young man! ls your father, The James Bond? Who is scared of your father? Tomorrow after we get married l will give him a white uniform.. ..and make him stand as a guard at my gate. With the same gun in his hand. Will you leave my hands or should l scream? l am sure you will die if he sees you with me. - Young man! Just watch how our acquaintance will develop into a friendship. Young man! Show this watch to your grandchildren. Young man! What are you doing here? Nothing. Where is the young man? l don't know. Where is he gone? l don't know. Don't scream. What is in your hand? Nothing. Uncle! Uncle! Where did you go, Uncle? Two minutes you went out of my sight l was lost. How much l searched for you. You know how much l searched for you too. Where did you go? Should l have to tell everything in detail? Oh! So you went to the wash room. lsn't he very funny? Like a small kid. Uncle, my parents always taught me that.. ..however great a person might be. He should always be humble and polite like a child. That is the best advice they have given you. Thank you, Uncle. Your daughter has no sense in her. She is so dumb. How did you give birth to such a dull child? She has no judgment of her future husband. Look Uncle, keep a smart man like me in front. Keep? Your aim, uncle. What a super aim it was! Looking at your aim. Any one can say what a super army officer you are. Thank you! Thank you! Shall we continue? Yes, yes. Come on uncle. - Father! Mother is waiting to give you an oil bath. Today is your Marriage anniversary. Don't you remember that? Will you come home fast or waste time playing here? You decide as l am going. Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't go. l thought it was tomorrow. She might eat me alive if l go alone. She will keep quiet if you are with me. Come on. Come on. Yes uncle. Yes Uncle. Pritu, there will be many people.. ..present at the anniversary party today. You behave yourself and do not play pranks. Mother, you will never find another decent man.. ..like me on this earth. One minute, l will come. Aunt, Being a lady how could you do this to the other? What did l do? Mom is very sad that you are not accompanying her. Why don't you come in my car, Aunt? Yes it is true. How foolish of me to leave her alone and come here. l will go with her. Nandu! Give it to me aunt. l will take care. l will hold it. Nandu, you come with father. Okay? Yes. - Hi! Young man. Hello! Uncle! Wow! Uncle! Looking great. You too. - Thank you, Uncle. Come on let us go. Uncle, l am going there. Oh! Chauffeuring the ladies? - Yes. How noble. Get in. Come on. Call me. Call me. l will drive the car. Call me. Young man! Uncle! Yes uncle. We will do one thing. Today is my 25th anniversary. Why don't you drive me to the party? - Sure Uncle. Daddy, this is too much. l will drive the car. Look, my daughter wishes the same. Sit down. Sit down. So nice of you. So nice of you. How far has your love story gone, Pritam? The girl is very slow, uncle. Not yet come to the level of hugging each other. Do you know my story? When l was in the army. l was traveling in a train from Delhi. ln the same train Babli was traveling with her college friends. Your mother Kamala was also there. You know how deep is Babli's and her friendship? You know your mother made us alight the train at some station.. ..and got us married in a nearby temple. And sent us back to Delhi. lt was monsoon then. Look, those days were also monsoon. What to do? Babli's people blamed your mother. - Yeah! We came back after a year with a child in Babli's arms. Nobody said anything to me. Everything settled smoothly. You are a handsome hunk, uncle. Whatever you do will be okay. lf people like you and me run with a girl. People will not talk. Love is something strange. You know everything went fine with us. Why don't you keep quiet when l am talking? Who made him a Colonel? Doesn't he need to have manners? Cannot bear this torture. Father and daughter are equally same. l am keeping quiet because he is my future father-in-law. Otherwise l would have slit his tongue and put it in the pocket. lt is destined that your father will be.. ..my father-in-law in all my seven lives. Who is scared of him? Who cares whether he can hear or not? l don't care. You just hear this. Father-in-law, if l take.. ..your daughter to Bangalore now. And take admission in the school for the children.. ..we will bear in future and then return home. Do you have any problem in this? Not at all. You drive cautiously. Thanks. Look, if there was father like yours all around. There would have been no problems to any lovers. Poor soul how easily he agreed. Papa, have you gone mad? What is wrong with you? Wait l will tell mama. lf he talking so cheaply you are sitting and grinning there. l hate you. Something wrong? On top of that you are asking if something is wrong. What more wrong should happen? Papa, be a little serious. You are grinning and agreeing to everything this idiot says. What is wrong with you? Did you hear her, young man? Yes, l heard her uncle. Hello Sir, wish you a happy anniversary. Oh! Thank you. Welcome sir. - Thank you. Everything is ready. - Is it? Very Good. Please come, sir. - Very Good. Very Good. Father! The battery of his hearing aid had fallen. l swear l did not remove it. l am a very good boy. Put it back to the machine. Poor fellow today is his anniversary.. ..let him at least hear people wishing him. Who me? Coming! Coming! Give! Give! Young man, aren't you giving me any present? With great difficult l have spent 25 years with her. What? No! With great desire. At least wish me, man. Yes uncle. Uncle, l am thinking of coming to you.. You are always welcome. Thank you, uncle. Colonel, ask him to sing. When he sings in the bathroom the girls in the neighboring hostel.. ..sings chorus with him. He sings very well. Come on young man. Make my day. l surely will, Uncle. l will create a festive atmosphere. Anything for you, your wife and your daughter. Your son-in-law and slightly for me. ''Luxuriance and joy.'' ''ln the song.'' ''Splash of colours.'' ''Born in the heart.'' ''Singing a beautiful song to you.'' ''Will carry you on his shoulders.'' ''And dance.'' ''Luxuriance and joy.'' ''ln the song.'' ''Splash of colours.'' ''Born in the heart.'' ''Singing a beautiful song to you.'' ''Will carry you on his shoulders.'' ''And dance.'' ''Your man is handsome than the gem.'' ''Like a shadow will follow you always.'' ''No one can stop him.'' ''Not a single moment.'' ''Can be tolerate to be away from you.'' ''Luxuriance and joy.'' ''ln the song.'' ''Splash of colours.'' ''Born in the heart.'' ''Singing a beautiful song to you.'' ''Will carry you on his shoulders.'' ''And dance.'' ''His heart like a swing.'' ''Where the love song is always playing.'' ''Friend, come listen to the music and swing.'' ''l knock at your door and invite you in.'' ''Luxuriance and joy.'' ''ln the song.'' ''Splash of colours.'' ''Born in the heart.'' ''Singing a beautiful song to you.'' ''Will carry you on his shoulders.'' ''And dance.'' Wasn't my dance beautiful? Do you know what self-respect is? l have heard about it somewhere. l do not have much idea about it. First learn to behave in public. Definitely. Just watch how l will behave from tomorrow. Do it fast, fast. Hey! Do it quickly. Lazy fellows! None of you know to work here. What is happening, young man? Look at the ground, uncle. Tomorrow if the bridegroom steps here. l am sure he will slip and fall directly inside the house. lt is so slippery here. It is okay if a person like me.. ..falls down on Nandini's wedding day. l am born to fall. But the bridegroom should not fall. Am l right, uncle? Hey! Scrub properly. ln Bangalore he does not lift the coffee mug from here to there. He is from such a lazy family. After coming here l don't know what has happened to him. lf his father was here. He surely would have got a heart attack looking at his son working. The matter is very serious, friends. Scrub here properly. Mother, l am getting late. Can l leave? Did you listen when l said to leave little early? ls Balkapur railway close by? By the time you travel 150 kms the train will already reach the station. Okay mother, Bye! Bye! Aunt. Rama! Rama! Didn't l tell you in the morning.. ..that we have to go to Balkapur station. She studied in Mumbai. Now when her friends come down there will be mayhem in the house. Oh! God! Rama, why did you fall? Can't you take care of the few bones left in your body? Get up, my dear. Get up! Get up! Poor fellow! Master! Sister! lf l ask him to drive. He gets into some problem or other. Poor fellow slipped and fell down. Father, l am sure he will not get ready today. l am getting late. l will drive but do not tell mother that. Go. Okay, but be careful sweety. Side please! Side please! Side please! Side please! Hello! Excuse me why were you crying in the morning? You were telling that there was some accident. What accident? Yes master. There was an accident at the highway road.. ..and 100 people died in that. Among them my neighbor's wife also died. That is why l am sad. Nandini wait! Do not go alone. Go with Pritam. Young man! Uncle! Uncle! Have you come here? - Yes. Go with her please! There is so much work here. l cannot leave it halfway. Come on. Come on. Just go like this, it is all right. Uncle, l am feeling shy to go in this dress. Fine. Then, change and go. Quickly go. Just because you are asking me, l am going. - Yes, l am asking you to go. Stop it. No! No! Please no! Stop the car. Yes, you're Honor. Get down. Oh! In this rain? lf l had not come with you, father would have felt sad. That's why l came so far. Now, if you simply don't shut your mouth and .. ..drive l will have to go on my way. Listen, what should l do? This Devdas is making me laugh. You know early in the morning he was crying. l asked him why are you crying? He said the elephant from our neighborhood is raped. And the police are searching for the offender. l asked him, why do you have cry if they.. ..are searching for the offender, Devdas? You know what he said? The police are doubting.. ..that the hare has raped the elephant. l said how could a hare rape an elephant, Devdas? You are 4 inches and the elephant's size is of a building. l said the police would not do anything. Not to worry. Do you know what he said? He said his name is already in the police.. ..records for raping the elephant earlier. Yes! If the girl laughs it means she has .. ..some feelings for me in her heart. Has she developed love for me, Devdas? Why do you feel sleepy when you hear about love? Will you be satisfied if the girl.. ..deceives me and l start drinking like you? lf you are heartless then from this moment there.. ..will be no relation between us, Devdas. Get lost! He is giving me all wrong ideas. What happened? He is telling to elope with the girl to Bangalore. Or else l will not progress in life Otherwise l will become Iove sick like him. So l said l am a good boy. It is wrong to do all that. And the girl will also get angry. Am l right? Can we leave? Be careful. After being a failure in love. He cannot stand the sight of girls. He scratches their face. He is not like that. He has become my friend too. He says he doesn't want to talk to you. ls that true, sir? Come here. l will not give him. He is completely offended by you. He says he has learnt all wrong things befriending you. He came to me pleading to teach him some manners. Now go check whether the train has arrived. Sir, will you look at me for a moment. l am looking at you. Tell what you want. What a look, Sir! It is wonderful! Sir, has the train from Mumbai arrived? Oh! l am fed of narrating the same story that due to the .. ..heavy rain in Mumbai the train has not moved. You mean the train will not arrive? lt will. But will arrive five hours late. What! five hours late? Boss, take keep this. Look Devdas, l do not want to waste a single minute.. ..of these five hours l am spending in her company. lf you can support me then be with me. Otherwise go to hell. l called home to tell the train is late. Father asked to visit the temple that is near by. Can we go? lf you beckon me l can follow you to any corner of the earth. Can we go? Devdas! Where is he gone? Devdas! Devdas! Look. Look at him. l jokingly asked him to die. Right away he went and sat there. l don't know which old movie he must have watched yesterday. Train! Devdas! lf you move an inch l will throw you out. Never in my life did l run few steps even to attend nature's call. And you made me run on the railway track. Do not talk. Be quiet. Enough of scolding him. l am fed up of hearing it. Fine. How could you say fine and keep quiet? You did not tell any stupid dialogues. lf you do not talk anything special it will be an insult to your tongue. Come on speak something. lf l talk, you tell me to shut up. And when l am quiet you ask me to talk. When l want to live you tell me die and .. ..when l want to die you ask me to live. How have you created these girls, Oh! God! l don't understand. You only have to take care of boys like me, Father. Earlier when you were speaking my body would burn with rage. But now when you talk l feel like talking. Oh! Why? Do l look like cartoon to you? You talk unnecessarily. But l realized.. ..you are a very emotional person also. After all if you are ready to give up your .. ..life just for the sake of a Hare. You really must be great. l have under estimated you a lot. Sorry! l think even the God does not understand your swing of .. ..moods when you ask to forgive, when you praise. When you smile and when you get angry. Listen, after creating the girls. The Lord created one more item immediately. Do you know what it is? l don't know. A sandal to slap. What is this comedy? When it is difficult to take four steps in life. These people are carrying a burden and climbing the steps. By the way what do they do after taking them up? Do they throw them down? Oh! Then, l should also bring my father here. You should not speak lightly of this temple. lf there is someone you like. And if you wish happiness to that person all his life. You have to carry him to the temple at the peak. There is a seat there. If you make the.. ..person sit there and seek God's blessings. The person will never face any problem in life. That means if we carry the person we like to the temple in the peak. The person will prosper and be happy? Absolutely! You are perfectly correct. Then, why don't you carry me? This is too much. Enough of your jokes. You do not know the power of this God. l will go up and offer my prayers and come. That means you will not carry me up. l am feeling very sad. Nandini! Before climbing the stairs.. ..if you close your eyes and think of God. l heard God will gives double blessings.. ..and there will be double effect. Close your eyes and count ten. You speak any nonsense. Okay. What happened? Why did you stop? Listen! Father! Listen tell me what is wrong. l feel l have grown old, my dear. l cannot. Your father has become an old man now. Why are you being emotional, father? lt is enough to me that you carried me up all these years. l wished to carry you up till my last breath. But l don't think l can do it, child. With years no man turns young. Do not talk like that. It hurts. My daughter should never walk. She should always be carried to the temple. l wish she would always be happy. Father, next year your son-in-law will carry me. Okay? As it is we have decided to get her married. So from next year her husband will carry her. Forget about it now. You simply do not worry and frighten us. Good idea. Other than me it should be her husband to carry her. Other than me it should be her husband to carry her. Devdas, l got 5 hours of golden moments with the girl. And the girl is simply wasting time staring at the water. lsn't this injustice? What is it madam you look very sad? Look! Madam, the lake has come up. Five minutes back there was no water in the lake. Did you shed tears and fill it? Why did you carry me to the temple? Oh! Is that the matter? Listen, you told me that if a person is.. ..carried to the temple and put on the seat. He would be happy in life. So l carried you and made you sit on the seat. So why are you behaving like a heroine.. ..of an old movie suffering from cancer? Please leave me alone. Devdas, for everything you ring the bell and say no, no. Then why didn't you stop me from carrying the girl? Look there, now she is standing in anger. lt is difficult to understand these girls even if we are thousand times. lt is raining. Come! Yes you! lf you fall sick by getting wet in the rain. Your father will shoot me with his old rifle. And your dad has super aim. Come! Come! Wipe the child's head. lt is the first rain it might be difficult if she falls sick. Go child. Go. Come, come. Poor girl! Show sympathy to me also, grandpa. Even l am drenched in the rain. You come here. Come sit here. l have some other medicine to keep you warm. Being a man you have caught cold. No, l am a good boy. This is meant for good boys, take. ls it? But still l don't want. lt is all right. You take this. Take child wear this sari. Wear it. Grandma, how do l drape it? Foolish girl, don't you know to wear a sari? Come here. You are refusing when l ask you. lt feels very good in this monsoon. Just taste it. Whom ever l meet forces me to drink. Why is it like that, grandpa? lt is the holy water of God. Like God. l don't want. Give this to him. When l was young l had come to this area to purchase livestock. Seeing my wife in this dress l fell in love with her. Now you cannot do anything. Now drink this. Take. Foolish boy. ''Don't know why l have a feeling today.'' ''That you are only mine.'' ''From the magical world.'' ''You have come for me.'' ''Oh! What a pleasant torture.'' ''Kill me Oh! Girl for once.'' ''Just like that.'' ''Don't know why l have a feeling today.'' ''The incessant drizzle.'' ''Spreads your fragrance.'' ''lf you go in anyone's dream.'' ''Turmoil in the heart.'' ''The full moon took leave.'' ''Looking at you.'' ''l am a prisoner in your prison.'' ''Come hold me in your arms once.'' ''Just like that.'' ''Don't know why l have a feeling today.'' ''There is sweetness of words.'' ''ln the flower like lips.'' ''ln the pages of heart.'' ''There is only your signature.'' ''Your name which is not written in fate.'' ''l have engraved it on my heart.'' ''Do you realize that?'' ''Call out my name once.'' ''Just like that.'' ''Don't know why l have a feeling today.'' ''That you are only mine.'' ''From the magical world.'' ''You have come for me.'' ''Oh! What a pleasant torture.'' ''Kill me Oh! Girl for once.'' ''Just like that.'' ''Don't know why l have a feeling today.'' Should drink like this? When drunk, you look beautiful. l am not drunk. l am not talking about you. But about me. Come it is time for the train to arrive. ln this cool weather why are you talking about time? Time means it is surely 420. Time is there to deceive. Look, l thought you would surely be mine. And a time would come when we will have a dozen children of our own. That time did not come. l thought you would hug me tightly.. ..and shed one and half liters of tears.. ..and weep if you ever marry it is to me and no one else.. ..that l am perfect match to you.. ..l thought the time to shed those tears has come. But that time did not come. l realized that l would not get you in my life. Because my time is not correct. When the time is not perfect if he smashes his head to a wall. lt is only the injury in his head he has to suffer. ln that, l have tried to tear out.. ..my heart and place it at your feet. My heart is spoilt. Your memories, this rain, your smile.. ..your hair, the sound of your anklets.. ..your beauty, your voice, your watch. The sound of that rascal diva's bell all these have.. ..made a un repairable hole in my heart. l have given up. l have given you up. lnstead of being a loafer in your opinion. l feel it is enough if l rather were a decent guy till my end. But remember one thing. Listen carefully. In this rain one cannot hear anything. l will come to tell that. Can l tell? You marry anyone in life. But there will be no other soul on this earth.. ..who will love you as much as l do. l love you that much. Wherever you be.. ..however you be even if you forget me or remember me. Any many number of children you have and you become old and feeble.. ..Even if you die one day, my love for you will never die. One or the other day even l will die. But l will like you even after my death. Even if l take thousand lives l will not love anyone else than you. l am not miserable that l will not get you. The four days l spent with you is enough for me. With these memories.. ..l can spend my whole life. Thank you, Nandini. You are a Goddess who opened my eyes regarding love. Till these eyes closes and becomes one this soil. l will not forget your favor. You are a Goddess of Love! But it hurts a lot. But this pain is a sweet torture. Sweet pain! Sweet memories! And along with that a hot local drink. lf this is in hand there is no fear of losing. Little drink is left Iet me finish it. Hey Loafer! Close your eyes. He is asking who is Iove struck he or l? No! Once when you held my hands to help me l lost my heart. Now l don't know what else l will lose. No, if the rainwater is shielded you can see my tears. And l will feel embarrassed. l will feel embarrassed. ''Let life blossom, friend.'' ''ln the bouquet of friendship.'' ''Let not the flower of friendship wither.'' ''ln the bond of love.'' ''Let all the feelings be buried in the heart.'' ''Let the music of silence throb.'' ''Just like that.'' Hey, hi! - Hi Nandini! Hi! Nandini! - Hi! You are late. l am so sorry. l am very sorry. Hi! Excuse me. Why young man? My daughter's friends have come, that too young girls. lnstead of being energetic and try to befriend a girl.. ..you are sitting like a crow stuck on the electric pole. l am fed up of life trying to lure one girl, uncle. Do l need one more now? lt will be very difficult. Oh! Is it so? Then do one thing. Take your girl to the Malligepur temple. Everything will be all right. Do you think so? Definitely. Haven't you been there today? How is the temple, that devotion and that faith? You will never find it anywhere. By the way, thanks. That you did not let Nandini climb the steps. She told that you went up to bring the God's offerings. Anything for elders, uncle. Great! My daughter is a monkey. lf l tell her not to climb the steps she will climb. That is why it is decided that in future if not me.. ..than her husband would carry her up those steps. ls it, Uncle? Yes. From this year it will be her husband to carry her. l have retired. Yes! Devdas, did you hear? What is this? Everything is rotating. We have a chance here. Carrying a 55 Kgs girl up the mountain has not gone waste. lt is working out. l am in a husband's position now. Devdas, whatever l say you are giving.. ..a negative signal. You! What? Where are you going? Wait. Look at your daughter. She will be in this dress at her wedding. We just tried it on her to see if everything is perfect. How is it? Super! Wonderful! But something is missing. Now you started your comments. Young man, can you think of anything? Yes l do, uncle. Tell then. Marriage is a big occasion. But at time like this if the girl's forehead is bare. She resembles a ghost in the horror movie. lf she puts vermilion on forehead she would look like a Goddess. That's it. - Yes yes. Oh! My God! How could you forget that, ladies? Pritam is right. With vermilion on forehead my daughter will look like a Goddess. Great! Young man. That's why l say to ask Pritam's opinion. Go sweetie go put the vermilion and come. Go child. Kamala your son is not an ordinary person. Being ladies we did not realize it. We just forget that, as she is a modern girl. Look, he found it out. She might come. She must be selecting the bind. So long? Something must have happened. She is very dull since morning. Ask her what the matter is. You don't remove that. Put it back. Hi! Nandu! What happened to you, child? What baby? What happened? Why have you soaked the wedding sari? Do you have to throw it like that? Now what has happened that you are sitting like this? Did anyone tell anything to you? Rama! Bring the gun. Listen, for everything you are asking for gun. She must be sad of going to Delhi leaving us. ls it dear? No baby. Gautam will be with you in Delhi. You will not even remember us. Listen, l know how much it hurts to leave.. ..behind a loving parents and go away. But if you worry and sit like this. lt will shatter your father's and my heart. Yes child. - Get up my dear. Get up. Devdas! Devdas! Sorry uncle. l came searching for Devdas. l did not know that a family discussion was going on here. Sorry! Hey! It is all right. Come here. - Come. Young man, look Nandini is little upset. Try to console her. - Who l? lf not you who else can make her laugh? - Yes. Then it is confirmed that l am either a joker or a buffoon. No! No it is not like that. But what matter should l console her on? One never knows for what, why and where.. ..these girls get depressed. - Correct. Listen, she feels sad that she has to leave us all.. ..and go to a new place. Look, cheer her up and bring her down for dinner. - Okay. And l will call her friends for dinner. Listen! All his life he is being doing this. Should l sing a sad song relating to mother's house? lt will set to the situation. Okay l will not sing. It is simply cancelled. Oh! No! This sari is also causing trouble. l do so many wrong things. Isn't it? So are you here, boss? The person with whom l wanted to elope from here.. ..is getting married with another person. And going out of the house from the main door. Why do we need this short cut, Devdas? Let us untie it. Do not untie it. l said do not untie it. Let it be there. l did not understand. No need to understand, forget. This is the first time l am confused in life. Everything is your blessing. ''Knowingly he is scorching himself.'' ''Has dived into the whirlpool of love.'' ''Laughing even at the face of death.'' ''What turmoil.'' ''Making me lend a helping hand.'' ''To a sinking heart.'' ''This heart of mine is falling for him.'' ''What turmoil.'' No. 1 . Wonderful! 721/2. No. 2. 771/4. No. 3, 813/4. Hey! Men are prohibited. No entry for men. Go back! Go back! Clap harder! Clap! Clap! Zero. Write Zero. Zero. Write Zero. Babli, these girls are crazy of your husband. And your husband is no less. Look how he is enjoying wearing that T-shirt and shorts among the girls. Okay! Okay! l will give everyone 100. Hundred! Hundred! Yes, l am fed up of seeing this. That is why l have named him as Paramveer Chatri. lnstead of Paramveer Chakra. Okay! Okay! l will give everyone 100. Hundred! Hundred! Okay not 100 but 110. l will give everyone a 110. - Hello! Okay. One minute! One minute! One minute! There are some more girls coming from hometown. Will you go to pick them up, please? ls it? Why not? Because if you say l cannot refuse. Girls l will see you back soon. You told you would go to distribute the marriage.. ..invitations along with these imps. Go fast now. Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! What is this? l can forgive for the first mistake. Second time l can say it is okay. But this is happening for the third time with me. God! Enough of this man's life. Get ready fast. lf you tell that can l refuse? Where are we going? You will know. Quick! Devdas, that girl might come again. Keep watching you humble soul. My life has become like a cabaret dancer. Please, come. Can we go? Yes. Yes. If you order than finished. Oh! So many marriage invitation cards! Whom will you distribute this? There are not more than 2 and half houses in your area. l am not giving it to anyone. l kept that to avoid anyone from sitting there. l did not understand. Forget that let me not interpret it. Why have you taken that? My life is in that watch. Do you think only your life is depended on this? Do you say so? No, l did not understand this also. You will understand everything. Stop the car let them go ahead. Whatever you say? Now? Turn to the left. Okay. Yes. Hey! Keep quiet. Do not talk. l will hit you. Look, he is telling the girl to change the route. Ask her whether she is gone mad. Yes he is right. Now run the car. Your command is my duty. One minute. Cycle shop owner must be her uncle. Must have gone to give him the invitation. Eat this. Hop. Next? Will you take me to the top of the waterfalls? There? - Yes! Keep quiet! Keep quiet! Rascal you don't talk. What happened? He says the girls is really gone insane and to be careful. There! Since my childhood l dreamt of going there. Will you take me or not? l have been taking your orders and done nothing else. Come let us finish this also. Wow! This is beautiful! Hey! Who is there to give the marriage invitation? You are also great. Next program? Do not talk. Tie this watch on my wrist. Will you do it or not? After all that happened. l could not stop myself from falling in love with you. Promise that you would never abandon this hand that you held. What did you say? l will make everyone agree to this. And If they don't agree. The sari l tied is always there. ''Come dancing to me.'' ''Come with consent and love.'' ''The beauty of rain drops.'' ''Falling on your dancing form.'' ''You brought sparkle to my life.'' ''Come closer than life.'' ''Love is marvel.'' ''Love is marvel.'' ''Looking at your love.'' ''l am fascinated.'' ''You silly boy.'' ''Should l be precise?'' ''You gave wings to my happiness.'' ''Come let us soar in sky.'' ''Love is marvel.'' ''When you flex yourself.'' ''There is pleasant quiver in my body.'' ''You beckoned me with your eyes.'' ''Without words or phrases thrilling me.'' ''Let my reflection fill your senses.'' ''You brought fragrance to flower.'' ''Let us blossom in this fragrance.'' ''All this is for you.'' ''Love! The moment you came to my life.'' ''This earth and sky seems new.'' ''My heart has blossomed.'' ''Like flower with pleasure.'' ''l want nothing but you.'' ''Come dancing to me.'' ''Come with consent.'' ''You brought sparkle to my life.'' ''Come closer than life.'' ''Love is marvel.'' ''Love is marvel.'' ''Looking at your love.'' ''l am fascinated.'' ''You silly boy.'' ''Should l be precise?'' ''You gave wings to my happiness.'' ''Come let us soar in sky.'' ''Love is marvel.'' Why? What did l do? Look who is asking this? When l told that l have fallen in love. You should have hugged tightly. Instead you made this.. ..poor man wait, torture himself distressed and wasted my time. Don't l have to test the boy's character? Doesn't he have to pass the test? You girls are born to torment the boys. A dog's life is better than ours. Now what? Will you marry me soon or not? Do you remember that in two days l will be married? l have done a plan to cancel the marriage. l will surely make everyone agree. Otherwise we have to elope. Running away is not a joke. l am a girl who is supposed to get married very soon. Remember that. Don't anyone in your house sleep soundly? Someone is banging at my door. lt will be difficult if it happens after marriage. Didn't you understand? l will explain later on. Aunt! Come here. You sit here. - What is it aunt? Pritam, tell me who is he? Who? Aunt? The one Nandini loves. You know. You know everything. Tell me the truth. Pritam in two days Nandini's will marry Gautam. That foolish girl now thinks she is in love with some one. And is thinking of eloping with him. Who told you that, Aunt? l heard it. l just heard her talking over the phone. She was telling this marriage is cancelled and we will run away. No, there is nothing like that, aunt. You have misunderstood. She is the child l borne. Hearing her breath l can say what is in her mind. You simply stop supporting her. Unluckily if Nandini thinks of running away with that boy. Do you know what calamity will befall on us? Do you know the boy she is to marry will be cheated? Do you know Prityam, how many people will lose their peace of mind here? Listen here, the man you look daily, my husband Colonel Subbaiah. Today he is among us alive and happy all because of that Gautam. Two years back he saved my husband.. ..from the bullets of the enemy while fighting in the border. Gautam is a soldier of whom the whole country.. ..and whole of Kodagu is proud of. My husband and l must have done some good deeds.. ..in life to have Gautam as a Son-in-law. Now Nandini is doing like this. Look here Pritam, my husband, my daughter and l.. ..the whole house has placed our confidence in you. l feel the Lord only has sent a kind hearted boy.. ..like you to us. Our Nandu doesn't trust.. ..or gets friendly with anyone so easily. But with you she is very comfortable and happy. She must have surely told you who the boy is. Tell me who it is, Pritu. lt's me Aunt. Pritam, do not joke. Don't you understand how much a mother's heart is agonized? Look, ask her who he is and try to bring her to her senses. lt is your responsibility that she does not commit.. ..any mistakes and see to that her marriage to Gautam.. ..solemnizes without any obstacles. Pritam, l do not have the strength.. ..with me to speak this matter to anyone. Our respect and honor are in your hands. Please do something, Pritam. Please! Thank you. Okay Gautam. Welcome. We will be waiting. Happy Journey. Bye! Babli, all of them have left. They will reach Bangalore in the evening. And in the morning they will be here. - Okay. What Boss? Looks like you are free today. What dear? Why is my baby sleeping on my lap today? Mummy, the girl l was talking about.. ..all these days is none other but Nandini. Nandini also likes me and is ready to run away with me. Mother, l cannot live without her. From the day you were born till today l had not hit you even for fun. But today l have. l did not know she was getting married. What could l do? Forget her. This whole family has various dreams.. ..and hopes for Nandini's marriage and future. Don't be a sinner to spoil their life. Look here child Pritu my dearest friend should not be a widow. People will blame you for spoiling an innocent girl's mind. Loving is not great. Sacrifice is great. Family, respect and humanity is more important than that. Be a human and not an animal. What did mummy tell? l do not have time to talk about your mother or mine. Do not ask what and why. lf there is any one who could save us.. ..than it is your father The Great Colonel Subbaiah. l will tell him. Beg with him. If he doesn't agree. lf he doesn't agree? What happened? What did you talk to Nandini? Will she? Aunt, you don't worry. Your daughter will always be happy in life. l am there to see to that. The marriage day is fast approaching. Does any one of you have seriousness in life? First complete the work l have given you.. ..and then show me your face. Get out! No one is serious here. You do not yell like that. It does not solve any problem. Learn to be little silent. l know it, Babli. l know it. Where did l shout? l am doing my work silently. No need of you preaching me. Master! - Hey don't shout. Are you deaf? What? The priest. Oh! Good morning! l mean hello. Good morning, sir. A very good morning. How are you, sir? You. Here l am expecting a priest to speak in pure kannada or Sanskrit. He is speaking in English. Bad! Rama, keep him out. And you two, do you know Sanskrit or is it English? What sir? We have learnt our Upanishads and Chaturvedas. And must have understood it. Yes, good and that is Sanskrit. Rama, take both of them inside. Come, sir. Where are you going? Leave. Will you go or should l start repeating in Sanskrit. Thanks. Uncle, aunt told that you should not go for jogging. l have stopped going for jogging since a year. Uncle, aunt told have you gone mad to wear jogging suit to go jogging.. ..when there is so much work left to be managed. Yes, l have gone mad. Tell her l will go for jogging. Uncle, can l accompany you? Are you coming? Come. Young man, let us go back. We have just started. Being a military man how could you tire so easily? l got angry when she told l have gone mad. So l came out of the house in anger. Now my anger has cooled down. And l can't go further. l will ask you something. And then we can go back. Look, you are in the company of a deaf person. Your words should not go wasted. See If my hearing aid has fallen down fix it and then start. Uncle, will you get Nandini and me married? Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! What happened uncle? Uncle. Don't worry. Uncle, come let me take you in my car. Get up, uncle. Don't move me. Two minutes. Your Iegs are very comforting. l don't know how many times l have fallen down.. ..like this holding my chest. Every time l got up alone. And would walk back alone. This time it is my luck you were with me. This stupid heart. Why doesn't it stop beating once for all? Uncle, do you have to talk like that? l don't know what to say. l am still a kid. l do not feel like you are a young boy. Because a person with good mind is always warm hearted. You are very greathearted boy. l don't why? ln my entire military career this old man never liked.. ..anyone. Never trusted anyone. Nor there was anyone close to my heart. But, you have taken a very special place in my heart. There is a secret in my life l did not want to share.. ..with anyone till my death. But, today l want to share it with you. Can l? l will finish it fast. l will not bore you. Do you need my permission to talk, uncle? l might die at any moment, Pritam. l am liv ing along with death , Pritam . A year before l got retired from military. l had a heart attack when l was in my camp. After that three bullets got stuck in my back. Two bullets were anyhow removed. But the third one had gone so deep that it has has wounded my heart. No one could do anything. There is no remedy. Only to let this heart beat as long as it is possible. My wife and daughter only know that l have been wounded on my back. But they do not know that l am in a dying state or am waiting to die. They do not know that l came back here to my hometown to my house.. ..where l was born and grew up to breathe my last. They should not know this, Pritam. lncase l die before the marriage. You have to help me, Pritam. You have to hide this old man's body.. ..and see that the marriage takes place. Nandini is my baby, my life. There should not be any obstacles in her marriage. Do not think l will be quiet after marriage, young man. l will take rebirth in my daughter's stomach. And that junior Subbaiah will play with a toy gun like this. Wherever you are he will come searching for you. Like you call me uncle he too will call you uncle. Like you helped me. When you get old he would help you. Yes? Do you think it is a very big plan? When l know l am dying? Can't l dream this much? Thank you, young man. By the way didn't you want to tell me something? ''Dreaming of living together in every birth.'' ''The flower of love blossomed.'' ''ln the garden of love.'' ''Got burnt in fire of rain.'' ''Life is distressed.'' ''Like the thunder struck to heart.'' ''Shattered are all the dreams.'' ''l have lost all l cherished.'' ''My way has come to an end.'' What is wrong with you? Why are you avoiding me? Talk. ln two days it is my marriage. Do you remember that l will break that marriage and will come with you? Do you remember l am ready to Ieave my parents just for you? l am placing my whole life in your hand. Do you know that? Why should l remember that? l do not understand. What should l do remembering all that? Maybe for fun and time pass l spoke of love to you. l did not know that you would go mad to this level. Will anyone call this love? The girl who is supposed to marry in two days is ready to elope with me. What is the guarantee that tomorrow you would not love someone.. ..else and you will not run behind him? l have to leave this place, Devdas. What can l do? People trust me. And that is my problem. lt is easy to gain trust but difficult to treasure it. l know Devdas if l leave this house you will follow me. So l have tied you up. Forgive me, friend. Listen mister, in two hours the sun will rise. Are you going to sit here all night? Why are you looking at my face? What is your story? Do not ask my story. On the first page of my story the end is written. Will you give one more bottle? My fate. Gautam, the road is blocked. l think we will have to take other route. l will enquire. You see if you can do anything here. - Okay. Excuse me, is there any other route from here. A tree has fallen and due to rain. When this rain can turn a life upside down. And what is this tree? Excuse me! One minute. What sir? ls there any other route to Colonel Subbaiah's house? This is the only route. Oh! Due to rain a tree has fallen on the road. Will you help me to lift it? Tomorrow is my marriage. l am Colonel Subbaiah's son-in-law. ls it? Come. Nandini! Are you the one to marry her? Die! l understand your pain. Love! You Iove Nandini very much, isn't it? My story is also same. l love her as much as you do. Both of our love. But in our destiny. He is destined for her love. Tomorrow is her marriage. And then she will go away. The heart is breaking. Isn't it? Come, we both are in sorrow. ln such a short span. Bye! You have a great heart. You are great. Hi! My name is Gautam. My name is spoilt. No use of telling it. l did not understand. No need to. Anyways, my car is punctured. Can you help me? l think l am destined to help you to get married. Thank you so much. So, still you did not tell me your name. What is in the name? Fine. My marriage. Please come. You must come. lf l come inside. Forget about it. l will go. l cannot be here. Can l keep this watch? As a momentum. Do not try to remember me. It is of no use. Nothing like that, l liked this watch. So l asked. lf you don't like to give it is all right. lt is not the question of likings but it is difficulty. l did not understand. No need to. l have crores of memories in this watch. My life is in it. l am sorry. lt is okay. Happy married life. Good luck. Thank you. Excuse me, girls! Can l speak to my wife? Come on, let's go. Let's go. Nandini, speak with respect. Hi! Hi! From the day l got engaged l have been carrying.. ..your photograph in my wallet. l would always look at it. Now l will live with you. l am happy, Nandini. l am thankful to your dad. l never thought an orphan like me would get a girl like you. l will keep you very happy, Nandini. Attention! Yes, sir. You are a good sport. But today you are only a groom. And from today l am father-in-law and you are my son-in-law. From now onwards your place will always be here. Welcome to our small family. Thanks. Will you have a peg and sit for the marriage.. ..or after marriage you will have it? Oh! God! Early in the morning? Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine. We will have it in the evening. Father! - Okay uncle. You get ready. - Okay uncle. What baby? Father! Father, l am sorry. Why sorry, baby? Unknowingly if l have hurt you. Please forgive me, father. You can never do any mistake, baby. As your father if l have done anything wrong. Please forgive me, my child. Other than your happiness and your peace.. ..nothing is left in your father's life. Thank you, father. Why did you come with me, Devdas? What is there in my life? With great desire l lighted a candle. But the rain doused it. Hey, where is your son? He's not to be seen. He is on his way. - All the credit goes to him. l'll never forget the favor he did to us. l'll tell you later. Get him soon. l did not know this rain has fire in it, Devdas. He is nowhere. l searched all over the estate all night. l did not find him. - Fine. lf anyone asks tell them you do not know. Okay madam. Kamala! Where is Pritam? He is gone out. l had sent for him. He will come. Oh! Young man's presence brings a charm to the marriage. Send him to me when he comes. Okay. Struck in the rain and love l got lost in life. l have no goal in life, friend. Will l survive with so much pain filled in my heart? My son, you look satisfied. That l have come to your way. You are sleeping peacefully. Wake Devdas. lf you don't listen to me who else will? Wake up. Should drink like this? When drunk, you look beautiful. l am not drunk. l am not talking about you. But about me. Come it is time for the train to arrive. ln this cool weather why are you talking about time? Time means it is surely 420. Time is there to deceive. Look, l thought you would surely be mine. And a time would come when we will have a dozen children of our own. That time did not come. l thought you would hug me tightly.. ..and shed one and half liters of tears.. ..and weep if you ever marry it is to me and no one else.. ..that l am perfect match to you.. ..l thought the time to shed those tears has come. But that time did not come. l realized that l would not get you in my life. Because my time is not correct. When the time is not perfect if he smashes his head to a wall. lt is only the injury in his head he has to suffer. ln that, l have tried to tear out.. ..my heart and place it at your feet. My heart is spoilt. Your memories, this rain, your smile.. ..your hair, the sound of your anklets.. ..your beauty, your voice, your watch. The sound of that rascal diva's bell all these have.. ..made a un repairable hole in my heart. l have given up. l have given you up. lnstead of being a loafer in your opinion. l feel it is enough if l rather were a decent guy till my end. But remember one thing. Listen carefully. In this rain one cannot hear anything. l will come to tell that. Can l tell? You marry anyone in life. But there will be no other soul on this earth.. ..who will love you as much as l do. l love you that much. Wherever you be.. ..however you be even if you forget me or remember me. Any many number of children you have and you become old and feeble.. ..Even if you die one day, my love for you will never die. One or the other day even l will die. But l will like you even after my death. Even if l take thousand lives l will not love anyone else than you. l am not miserable that l will not get you. The four days l spent with you is enough for me. With these memories.. ..l can spend my whole life. Thank you, Nandini. You are a Goddess who opened my eyes regarding love. Till these eyes closes and becomes one this soil. l will not forget your favor. You are a Goddess of Love! But it hurts a lot. But this pain is a sweet torture. Sweet pain! Sweet memories! And along with that a hot local drink. lf this is in hand there is no fear of losing. Little drink is left Iet me finish it. Hey Loafer! Close your eyes. He is asking who is Iove struck he or l? No! Once when you held my hands to help me l lost my heart. Now l don't know what else l will lose. No, if the rainwater is shielded you can see my tears. And l will feel embarrassed. l will feel embarrassed. ''Let life blossom, friend.'' ''ln the bouquet of friendship.'' ''Let not the flower of friendship wither.'' ''ln the bond of love.'' ''Let all the feelings be buried in the heart.'' ''Let the music of silence throb.'' ''Just like that.'' Hey, hi! - Hi Nandini! Hi! Nandini! - Hi! You are late. l am so sorry. l am very sorry. Hi! Excuse me. Why young man? My daughter's friends have come, that too young girls. lnstead of being energetic and try to befriend a girl.. ..you are sitting like a crow stuck on the electric pole. l am fed up of life trying to lure one girl, uncle. Do l need one more now? lt will be very difficult. Oh! Is it so? Then do one thing. Take your girl to the Malligepur temple. Everything will be all right. Do you think so? Definitely. Haven't you been there today? How is the temple, that devotion and that faith? You will never find it anywhere. By the way, thanks. That you did not let Nandini climb the steps. She told that you went up to bring the God's offerings. Anything for elders, uncle. Great! My daughter is a monkey. lf l tell her not to climb the steps she will climb. That is why it is decided that in future if not me.. ..than her husband would carry her up those steps. ls it, Uncle? Yes. From this year it will be her husband to carry her. l have retired. Yes! Devdas, did you hear? What is this? Everything is rotating. We have a chance here. Carrying a 55 Kgs girl up the mountain has not gone waste. lt is working out. l am in a husband's position now. Devdas, whatever l say you are giving.. ..a negative signal. You! What? Where are you going? Wait. Look at your daughter. She will be in this dress at her wedding. We just tried it on her to see if everything is perfect. How is it? Super! Wonderful! But something is missing. Now you started your comments. Young man, can you think of anything? Yes l do, uncle. Tell then. Marriage is a big occasion. But at time like this if the girl's forehead is bare. She resembles a ghost in the horror movie. lf she puts vermilion on forehead she would look like a Goddess. That's it. - Yes yes. Oh! My God! How could you forget that, ladies? Pritam is right. With vermilion on forehead my daughter will look like a Goddess. Great! Young man. That's why l say to ask Pritam's opinion. Go sweetie go put the vermilion and come. Go child. Kamala your son is not an ordinary person. Being ladies we did not realize it. We just forget that, as she is a modern girl. Look, he found it out. She might come. She must be selecting the bind. So long? Something must have happened. She is very dull since morning. Ask her what the matter is. You don't remove that. Put it back. Hi! Nandu! What happened to you, child? What baby? What happened? Why have you soaked the wedding sari? Do you have to throw it like that? Now what has happened that you are sitting like this? Did anyone tell anything to you? Rama! Bring the gun. Listen, for everything you are asking for gun. She must be sad of going to Delhi leaving us. ls it dear? No baby. Gautam will be with you in Delhi. You will not even remember us. Listen, l know how much it hurts to leave.. ..behind a loving parents and go away. But if you worry and sit like this. lt will shatter your father's and my heart. Yes child. - Get up my dear. Get up. Devdas! Devdas! Sorry uncle. l came searching for Devdas. l did not know that a family discussion was going on here. Sorry! Hey! It is all right. Come here. - Come. Young man, look Nandini is little upset. Try to console her. - Who l? lf not you who else can make her laugh? - Yes. Then it is confirmed that l am either a joker or a buffoon. No! No it is not like that. But what matter should l console her on? One never knows for what, why and where.. ..these girls get depressed. - Correct. Listen, she feels sad that she has to leave us all.. ..and go to a new place. Look, cheer her up and bring her down for dinner. - Okay. And l will call her friends for dinner. Listen! All his life he is being doing this. Should l sing a sad song relating to mother's house? lt will set to the situation. Okay l will not sing. It is simply cancelled. Oh! No! This sari is also causing trouble. l do so many wrong things. Isn't it? So are you here, boss? The person with whom l wanted to elope from here.. ..is getting married with another person. And going out of the house from the main door. Why do we need this short cut, Devdas? Let us untie it. Do not untie it. l said do not untie it. Let it be there. l did not understand. No need to understand, forget. This is the first time l am confused in life. Everything is your blessing. ''Knowingly he is scorching himself.'' ''Has dived into the whirlpool of love.'' ''Laughing even at the face of death.'' ''What turmoil.'' ''Making me lend a helping hand.'' ''To a sinking heart.'' ''This heart of mine is falling for him.'' ''What turmoil.'' No. 1 . Wonderful! 721/2. No. 2. 771/4. No. 3, 813/4. Hey! Men are prohibited. No entry for men. Go back! Go back! Clap harder! Clap! Clap! Zero. Write Zero. Zero. Write Zero. Babli, these girls are crazy of your husband. And your husband is no less. Look how he is enjoying wearing that T-shirt and shorts among the girls. Okay! Okay! l will give everyone 100. Hundred! Hundred! Yes, l am fed up of seeing this. That is why l have named him as Paramveer Chatri. lnstead of Paramveer Chakra. Okay! Okay! l will give everyone 100. Hundred! Hundred! Okay not 100 but 110. l will give everyone a 110. - Hello! Okay. One minute! One minute! One minute! There are some more girls coming from hometown. Will you go to pick them up, please? ls it? Why not? Because if you say l cannot refuse. Girls l will see you back soon. You told you would go to distribute the marriage.. ..invitations along with these imps. Go fast now. Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! What is this? l can forgive for the first mistake. Second time l can say it is okay. But this is happening for the third time with me. God! Enough of this man's life. Get ready fast. lf you tell that can l refuse? Where are we going? You will know. Quick! Devdas, that girl might come again. Keep watching you humble soul. My life has become like a cabaret dancer. Please, come. Can we go? Yes. Yes. If you order than finished. Oh! So many marriage invitation cards! Whom will you distribute this? There are not more than 2 and half houses in your area. l am not giving it to anyone. l kept that to avoid anyone from sitting there. l did not understand. Forget that let me not interpret it. Why have you taken that? My life is in that watch. Do you think only your life is depended on this? Do you say so? No, l did not understand this also. You will understand everything. Stop the car let them go ahead. Whatever you say? Now? Turn to the left. Okay. Yes. Hey! Keep quiet. Do not talk. l will hit you. Look, he is telling the girl to change the route. Ask her whether she is gone mad. Yes he is right. Now run the car. Your command is my duty. One minute. Cycle shop owner must be her uncle. Must have gone to give him the invitation. Eat this. Hop. Next? Will you take me to the top of the waterfalls? There? - Yes! Keep quiet! Keep quiet! Rascal you don't talk. What happened? He says the girls is really gone insane and to be careful. There! Since my childhood l dreamt of going there. Will you take me or not? l have been taking your orders and done nothing else. Come let us finish this also. Wow! This is beautiful! Hey! Who is there to give the marriage invitation? You are also great. Next program? Do not talk. Tie this watch on my wrist. Will you do it or not? After all that happened. l could not stop myself from falling in love with you. Promise that you would never abandon this hand that you held. What did you say? l will make everyone agree to this. And If they don't agree. The sari l tied is always there. ''Come dancing to me.'' ''Come with consent and love.'' ''The beauty of rain drops.'' ''Falling on your dancing form.'' ''You brought sparkle to my life.'' ''Come closer than life.'' ''Love is marvel.'' ''Love is marvel.'' ''Looking at your love.'' ''l am fascinated.'' ''You silly boy.'' ''Should l be precise?'' ''You gave wings to my happiness.'' ''Come let us soar in sky.'' ''Love is marvel.'' ''When you flex yourself.'' ''There is pleasant quiver in my body.'' ''You beckoned me with your eyes.'' ''Without words or phrases thrilling me.'' ''Let my reflection fill your senses.'' ''You brought fragrance to flower.'' ''Let us blossom in this fragrance.'' ''All this is for you.'' ''Love! The moment you came to my life.'' ''This earth and sky seems new.'' ''My heart has blossomed.'' ''Like flower with pleasure.'' ''l want nothing but you.'' ''Come dancing to me.'' ''Come with consent.'' ''You brought sparkle to my life.'' ''Come closer than life.'' ''Love is marvel.'' ''Love is marvel.'' ''Looking at your love.'' ''l am fascinated.'' ''You silly boy.'' ''Should l be precise?'' ''You gave wings to my happiness.'' ''Come let us soar in sky.'' ''Love is marvel.'' Why? What did l do? Look who is asking this? When l told that l have fallen in love. You should have hugged tightly. Instead you made this.. ..poor man wait, torture himself distressed and wasted my time. Don't l have to test the boy's character? Doesn't he have to pass the test? You girls are born to torment the boys. A dog's life is better than ours. Now what? Will you marry me soon or not? Do you remember that in two days l will be married? l have done a plan to cancel the marriage. l will surely make everyone agree. Otherwise we have to elope. Running away is not a joke. l am a girl who is supposed to get married very soon. Remember that. Don't anyone in your house sleep soundly? Someone is banging at my door. lt will be difficult if it happens after marriage. Didn't you understand? l will explain later on. Aunt! Come here. You sit here. - What is it aunt? Pritam, tell me who is he? Who? Aunt? The one Nandini loves. You know. You know everything. Tell me the truth. Pritam in two days Nandini's will marry Gautam. That foolish girl now thinks she is in love with some one. And is thinking of eloping with him. Who told you that, Aunt? l heard it. l just heard her talking over the phone. She was telling this marriage is cancelled and we will run away. No, there is nothing like that, aunt. You have misunderstood. She is the child l borne. Hearing her breath l can say what is in her mind. You simply stop supporting her. Unluckily if Nandini thinks of running away with that boy. Do you know what calamity will befall on us? Do you know the boy she is to marry will be cheated? Do you know Prityam, how many people will lose their peace of mind here? Listen here, the man you look daily, my husband Colonel Subbaiah. Today he is among us alive and happy all because of that Gautam. Two years back he saved my husband.. ..from the bullets of the enemy while fighting in the border. Gautam is a soldier of whom the whole country.. ..and whole of Kodagu is proud of. My husband and l must have done some good deeds.. ..in life to have Gautam as a Son-in-law. Now Nandini is doing like this. Look here Pritam, my husband, my daughter and l.. ..the whole house has placed our confidence in you. l feel the Lord only has sent a kind hearted boy.. ..like you to us. Our Nandu doesn't trust.. ..or gets friendly with anyone so easily. But with you she is very comfortable and happy. She must have surely told you who the boy is. Tell me who it is, Pritu. lt's me Aunt. Pritam, do not joke. Don't you understand how much a mother's heart is agonized? Look, ask her who he is and try to bring her to her senses. lt is your responsibility that she does not commit.. ..any mistakes and see to that her marriage to Gautam.. ..solemnizes without any obstacles. Pritam, l do not have the strength.. ..with me to speak this matter to anyone. Our respect and honor are in your hands. Please do something, Pritam. Please! Thank you. Okay Gautam. Welcome. We will be waiting. Happy Journey. Bye! Babli, all of them have left. They will reach Bangalore in the evening. And in the morning they will be here. - Okay. What Boss? Looks like you are free today. What dear? Why is my baby sleeping on my lap today? Mummy, the girl l was talking about.. ..all these days is none other but Nandini. Nandini also likes me and is ready to run away with me. Mother, l cannot live without her. From the day you were born till today l had not hit you even for fun. But today l have. l did not know she was getting married. What could l do? Forget her. This whole family has various dreams.. ..and hopes for Nandini's marriage and future. Don't be a sinner to spoil their life. Look here child Pritu my dearest friend should not be a widow. People will blame you for spoiling an innocent girl's mind. Loving is not great. Sacrifice is great. Family, respect and humanity is more important than that. Be a human and not an animal. What did mummy tell? l do not have time to talk about your mother or mine. Do not ask what and why. lf there is any one who could save us.. ..than it is your father The Great Colonel Subbaiah. l will tell him. Beg with him. If he doesn't agree. lf he doesn't agree? What happened? What did you talk to Nandini? Will she? Aunt, you don't worry. Your daughter will always be happy in life. l am there to see to that. The marriage day is fast approaching. Does any one of you have seriousness in life? First complete the work l have given you.. ..and then show me your face. Get out! No one is serious here. You do not yell like that. It does not solve any problem. Learn to be little silent. l know it, Babli. l know it. Where did l shout? l am doing my work silently. No need of you preaching me. Master! - Hey don't shout. Are you deaf? What? The priest. Oh! Good morning! l mean hello. Good morning, sir. A very good morning. How are you, sir? You. Here l am expecting a priest to speak in pure kannada or Sanskrit. He is speaking in English. Bad! Rama, keep him out. And you two, do you know Sanskrit or is it English? What sir? We have learnt our Upanishads and Chaturvedas. And must have understood it. Yes, good and that is Sanskrit. Rama, take both of them inside. Come, sir. Where are you going? Leave. Will you go or should l start repeating in Sanskrit. Thanks. Uncle, aunt told that you should not go for jogging. l have stopped going for jogging since a year. Uncle, aunt told have you gone mad to wear jogging suit to go jogging.. ..when there is so much work left to be managed. Yes, l have gone mad. Tell her l will go for jogging. Uncle, can l accompany you? Are you coming? Come. Young man, let us go back. We have just started. Being a military man how could you tire so easily? l got angry when she told l have gone mad. So l came out of the house in anger. Now my anger has cooled down. And l can't go further. l will ask you something. And then we can go back. Look, you are in the company of a deaf person. Your words should not go wasted. See If my hearing aid has fallen down fix it and then start. Uncle, will you get Nandini and me married? Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! What happened uncle? Uncle. Don't worry. Uncle, come let me take you in my car. Get up, uncle. Don't move me. Two minutes. Your Iegs are very comforting. l don't know how many times l have fallen down.. ..like this holding my chest. Every time l got up alone. And would walk back alone. This time it is my luck you were with me. This stupid heart. Why doesn't it stop beating once for all? Uncle, do you have to talk like that? l don't know what to say. l am still a kid. l do not feel like you are a young boy. Because a person with good mind is always warm hearted. You are very greathearted boy. l don't why? ln my entire military career this old man never liked.. ..anyone. Never trusted anyone. Nor there was anyone close to my heart. But, you have taken a very special place in my heart. There is a secret in my life l did not want to share.. ..with anyone till my death. But, today l want to share it with you. Can l? l will finish it fast. l will not bore you. Do you need my permission to talk, uncle? l might die at any moment, Pritam. l am liv ing along with death , Pritam . A year before l got retired from military. l had a heart attack when l was in my camp. After that three bullets got stuck in my back. Two bullets were anyhow removed. But the third one had gone so deep that it has has wounded my heart. No one could do anything. There is no remedy. Only to let this heart beat as long as it is possible. My wife and daughter only know that l have been wounded on my back. But they do not know that l am in a dying state or am waiting to die. They do not know that l came back here to my hometown to my house.. ..where l was born and grew up to breathe my last. They should not know this, Pritam. lncase l die before the marriage. You have to help me, Pritam. You have to hide this old man's body.. ..and see that the marriage takes place. Nandini is my baby, my life. There should not be any obstacles in her marriage. Do not think l will be quiet after marriage, young man. l will take rebirth in my daughter's stomach. And that junior Subbaiah will play with a toy gun like this. Wherever you are he will come searching for you. Like you call me uncle he too will call you uncle. Like you helped me. When you get old he would help you. Yes? Do you think it is a very big plan? When l know l am dying? Can't l dream this much? Thank you, young man. By the way didn't you want to tell me something? ''Dreaming of living together in every birth.'' ''The flower of love blossomed.'' ''ln the garden of love.'' ''Got burnt in fire of rain.'' ''Life is distressed.'' ''Like the thunder struck to heart.'' ''Shattered are all the dreams.'' ''l have lost all l cherished.'' ''My way has come to an end.'' What is wrong with you? Why are you avoiding me? Talk. ln two days it is my marriage. Do you remember that l will break that marriage and will come with you? Do you remember l am ready to Ieave my parents just for you? l am placing my whole life in your hand. Do you know that? Why should l remember that? l do not understand. What should l do remembering all that? Maybe for fun and time pass l spoke of love to you. l did not know that you would go mad to this level. Will anyone call this love? The girl who is supposed to marry in two days is ready to elope with me. What is the guarantee that tomorrow you would not love someone.. ..else and you will not run behind him? l have to leave this place, Devdas. What can l do? People trust me. And that is my problem. lt is easy to gain trust but difficult to treasure it. l know Devdas if l leave this house you will follow me. So l have tied you up. Forgive me, friend. Listen mister, in two hours the sun will rise. Are you going to sit here all night? Why are you looking at my face? What is your story? Do not ask my story. On the first page of my story the end is written. Will you give one more bottle? My fate. Gautam, the road is blocked. l think we will have to take other route. l will enquire. You see if you can do anything here. - Okay. Excuse me, is there any other route from here. A tree has fallen and due to rain. When this rain can turn a life upside down. And what is this tree? Excuse me! One minute. What sir? ls there any other route to Colonel Subbaiah's house? This is the only route. Oh! Due to rain a tree has fallen on the road. Will you help me to lift it? Tomorrow is my marriage. l am Colonel Subbaiah's son-in-law. ls it? Come. Nandini! Are you the one to marry her? Die! l understand your pain. Love! You Iove Nandini very much, isn't it? My story is also same. l love her as much as you do. Both of our love. But in our destiny. He is destined for her love. Tomorrow is her marriage. And then she will go away. The heart is breaking. Isn't it? Come, we both are in sorrow. ln such a short span. Bye! You have a great heart. You are great. Hi! My name is Gautam. My name is spoilt. No use of telling it. l did not understand. No need to. Anyways, my car is punctured. Can you help me? l think l am destined to help you to get married. Thank you so much. So, still you did not tell me your name. What is in the name? Fine. My marriage. Please come. You must come. lf l come inside. Forget about it. l will go. l cannot be here. Can l keep this watch? As a momentum. Do not try to remember me. It is of no use. Nothing like that, l liked this watch. So l asked. lf you don't like to give it is all right. lt is not the question of likings but it is difficulty. l did not understand. No need to. l have crores of memories in this watch. My life is in it. l am sorry. lt is okay. Happy married life. Good luck. Thank you. Excuse me, girls! Can l speak to my wife? Come on, let's go. Let's go. Nandini, speak with respect. Hi! Hi! From the day l got engaged l have been carrying.. ..your photograph in my wallet. l would always look at it. Now l will live with you. l am happy, Nandini. l am thankful to your dad. l never thought an orphan like me would get a girl like you. l will keep you very happy, Nandini. Attention! Yes, sir. You are a good sport. But today you are only a groom. And from today l am father-in-law and you are my son-in-law. From now onwards your place will always be here. Welcome to our small family. Thanks. Will you have a peg and sit for the marriage.. ..or after marriage you will have it? Oh! God! Early in the morning? Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine. We will have it in the evening. Father! - Okay uncle. You get ready. - Okay uncle. What baby? Father! Father, l am sorry. Why sorry, baby? Unknowingly if l have hurt you. Please forgive me, father. You can never do any mistake, baby. As your father if l have done anything wrong. Please forgive me, my child. Other than your happiness and your peace.. ..nothing is left in your father's life. Thank you, father. Why did you come with me, Devdas? What is there in my life? With great desire l lighted a candle. But the rain doused it. Hey, where is your son? He's not to be seen. He is on his way. - All the credit goes to him. l'll never forget the favor he did to us. l'll tell you later. Get him soon. l did not know this rain has fire in it, Devdas. He is nowhere. l searched all over the estate all night. l did not find him. - Fine. lf anyone asks tell them you do not know. Okay madam. Kamala! Where is Pritam? He is gone out. l had sent for him. He will come. Oh! Young man's presence brings a charm to the marriage. Send him to me when he comes. Okay. Struck in the rain and love l got lost in life. l have no goal in life, friend. Will l survive with so much pain filled in my heart? My son, you look satisfied. That l have come to your way. You are sleeping peacefully. Wake Devdas. lf you don't listen to me who else will? Wake up.
