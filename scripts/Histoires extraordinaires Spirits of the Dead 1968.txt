Wake them! I need fresh air! I want to ride, to forget this dream I had! Are you sure it was a dream? Sometimes you need me... to tell you what you did was real. Get out! You're always lurking about! At the age of twenty-two, Frederique, Countess of Metzengerstein inherited the entire family fortune. Rarely had a noble of this land come into such a legacy. She ruled over it capriciously: Both night and day according to her whim. That morning, haunted by her nightmare of the dawn, she decided to take her guests to the castle where she had spent her childhood. Marquis! Give me something to drink! Blood! Swine! Milady! What! Can't I enjoy myself? Surely one can still laugh. I love this place. It's beautiful! You have ten finer castles. Finer than childhood? Fool! Is that boy still annoying you? Shall I throw him out? And supposing he flies... It would be a pity! Shoot straight and true! The cord must break! Shameful debaucheries, flagrant treacheries, unheard of cruelties soon taught her vassals that nothing could guarantee them security against the remorseless fangs of this petty Caligula. Come! Come on! Give me the necklace, boy! - Is this our room? - I have a surprise for you. What is it? There she is. Don't be silly! I knew him long before you did! The other way! All encouraged her in her whims, not only her depraved friends, but many others who feared her displeasure. The sole exception to this rule, was the less well to do branch of their related Berlifitzing family, who were traditional enemies of the Metzengersteins, and openly critical of Frederique's behavior. These two families had been locked in discord for centuries, and their deadly enmity reaching so far back that none could remember its origins. At this time the young Baron Wilhelm of Berlifitzing lived alone in his family's castle. Although he was her closest neighbor, he had never spoken to his appalling cousin, Frederique of Metzengerstein. For her part, Frederique, if by chance she caught sight of her cousin from afar, would mock at him and openly show her scorn. But Wilhelm seemed not to notice her. His lively intelligence would have made him a great success in society but nothing interested this young misanthropist who divided his life between hunting and his stables. Help me! Quickly! If I find the idiot who set this trap, he'll be flogged for two hours and I'll apply the vinegar myself. Hurry! And stop staring! When a vixen gets caught, she plays dead. even if she's injured. Does it hurt? Chance alone brought Frederique and Wilhelm together. The girl would have preferred to hate this face that she knew not, but instead she was unable to forget it. Something within her had changed. Haunted by the memory of a gloomy, mocking glance, she had but one desire- to see Wilhelm again. Hunting the vixen, Wilhelm Berlifitzing? Sultan! Sultan! He'll be back. I'm cold! A Metzengerstein offers his cloak to a lady. You don't, apparently! You never speak, Cousin. My ankle still hurts from the trap. Prince! Do you only speak to animals? Come this evening. You'll find what you need. Most of my guests are boars, buzzards and bears. It should amuse you. I won't be part of your collection. I'm not accustomed to being refused. - Do not keep bad habits. - Who do you think you are? A happy man. Frederique! Wilhelm! Rejected and ridiculed when she'd never been so sincere Frederique angrily suppressed the emotions that had drawn her towards her cousin. Hughes! Her only thoughts were her vengeance. Hughes! Yes, Milady? How did he come here? He galloped here through the flames. - Whose is he? - Nobody knows. Not even the Baron Wilhelm's servants. No one knows this horse. - No one can approach him! - I'll try. Milady... The Baron Wilhelm is dead! What? He tried to save the horse he loved and died. Everything went up in flames. Everything. Hughes! Hughes! Hughes! Yes? You will repair this... as it was before. But that's impossible, Madam! You will, because I wish it! Find the best tapestry-maker. Frederique had ordered the stables to be set on fire without imagining that Wilhem would perish in the flames. His death satisfied neither her love, nor her bitterness. She felt a dark foreboding. Terror took hold of her. What are you thinking? Nothing. Go on. From that time forth, a marked change took place in the outward behavior of the young libertine. She no longer left her estate, excluding all companions. Qr could the wild, unearthly horse that she rode constantly have claimed some mysterious right of friendship... Frederique remained faithful to him. In the glare of noon, at the dead hour of night, in sickness or in health, in calm or in tempest, Frederique seemed riveted to the saddle of that colossal horse, his audacities so well accorded with her own spirit. I don't know. Some days, the threads sing. and tie themselves in knots. I asked you how long. Weeks... months perhaps. This spell, which she accepted with all her being, reached even into her solitary moments. She would spent hours before the tapestry that was slowly taking shape. Fascinated, she watched the agile hands of the old man, bringing back to life the great black steed. His fingers, so deftly knotting the threads, seemed to be weaving with a fatal logic, her own destiny. Help me now, my hands. You always served me well. Do not betray me. Have you worked it out? - Is it blood? - No, fire! Frederique had accepted and now desired her own end. She rushed toward the flames. Like Wilhelm, with Wilhelm, she will die by fire. - I want to confess! - After Mass. People are waiting. - No! Right away! - Please... - After Mass. - Now, I said! Proceed. I don't know how. Tell me what to do. Help me. I'm not a Catholic. In that case, my son, we'll talk after Mass. I want to confess, you must hear me! Do not shout. You're in God's house. I don't care about God! I need to understand. I want to talk. I've killed a man. Someone from this town? I don't know... I don't think so. - Ah, a stranger? - Yes. Well... no. I know him. I have always known him. You're drunk! Listen to me! It's your duty. Why did you kill him? I'll tell you everything, from the beginning. Franz von Lowenstein. William Wilson! It's from Italy. It must be from your Mother. Attention! At ease. Silence! Stop that! Wilson did it! Wilson! Down. Up. Down. Up. Down! Who's that? He's the new boy. - What is your name? - Wilson. William Wilson. - What's your name again? - William Wilson. His name was Wilson? The same as yours? Same name, precisely. - A coincidence. - Unacceptable. Power cannot be shared. Suddenly I had a rival. A rival, or rather a companion who beat me in everything, but who watched me from a benevolent distance. He exasperated me but I felt extremely curious about him. Good God! Wilson! You again, as usual! We were both expelled. It took me a long time to forget. has always haunted you. - Before you leave... - Let me finish! Several years later I enrolled in medicine, out of curiosity. I remind you that a doctor is also a sorcerer. We shall seek life in the depths of matter. And now I have the pleasure of dissecting before you a human body which has always been the dream of priests, poets or philosophers. To be precise, I shall open a human heart. If we were dealing with a live body, we'd process in this fashion. Going laterally from the sternum, between the 6th and 7th rib, we'd find the apex of the heart. But in the present case, we shall section all the ribs of the sub-auxiliary region on the left and the right as far as the sternum. Then we will separate the diaphragm and fold back the rib cage. This will reveal the contents of the thoracic cavity. The heart, gentlemen, is a hollow muscle composed essentially of a firm ventricular mass and a softer auricular mass. This pump which gives forth as much as it receives, has come to be seen as a symbol of courage and generosity. Does Mr. Wilson have a comment? No. In that case, we may proceed. Thank you! Even in dealing with a corpse, always be sure of the cleanliness of your instruments. It is said, gentlemen, that the heart is the seat of the emotions, the passions. Indeed. But experience shows that it is the seat of our cares, our sorrows. Its only generosity lies in the suffering it gives. So, when we have cut the ribs, separated the diaphragm and folded back what is commonly called the rib cage, we can deliver our patient from the source of her woes. The doctor is a benefactor. We will thus bring her relief. Along with the heart... No! We'll remove despair and the pain of love. Gentlemen, we shall restore her her pristine purity, the peace of paradise lost. Even if it's a living person, make sure your instruments are perfectly clean. Here, put this on! Cover yourself. Did she die? Forget about the girl! It's him, don't you see? I had to leave the University, and I joined the Austrian Army. To fight. But no one fights anymore. The twin garrison is infamous. Thanks to me. People have told me all about the trouble. The poor women. All was well... until that night. Don't. It's Wilson! You recognize me? I'm flattered. There were many of us the other night. It was dark, and you were so busy. Good evening, Mr Wilson. - Is that Wilson? - Be careful, Tonina. This Wilson is surely not the lover you dream of. He's made his reputation from men... not from us. He loves parades, the theater, dressing up. He needs an audience. But in private, he puts on a poor show. - Have you met him before? - No... and I don't want to. I hate wasting my time. - Are you referring to me? - You... you. You are not the only man alive, Wilson. Are you taunting me? Are you threatening me? I'm challenging you. Ace. She loved cards. But I could always keep my hand up. I decided to teach her a lesson. Court card! Two hundred. Double. I'll see you. Ace, Jack. Wilson has lost. Are you sure? Ace, King. I thought you were bluffing. Bluff and window-dressing... That's you, Wilson. The card-player resembles the lover. He gets tired. No staying power, my dear. Court card. Ace. Will you accept my watch? It has three jewels. I'll see you, my dear. Ace, King. The same. The game continues. Court card. Court card. Ace. Pour me a drink while I collect. From then on, she lost inexorably until morning. Ace. All of it. I want to see you. Top card? Top card. Franz, count this up, please. Thank you, sir. Add a thousand. Four thousand thalers, plus a thousand... - I can't pay you, Wilson! - No problem. I propose double or nothing. It's your last chance. If you win, we're even. And if I lose? You'll still owe me nothing. But you'll be mine. How? 0n what conditions? Whatever conditions I choose. Decide. Quickly. It's six o'clock. I accept. Ace. King. Now we pick up from the deck. Jack. Your luck is returning. No. I was wrong! You've lost, Giuseppina! Where? When? Here. Now. We shall leave you both. There's no need, in fact... stay, gentlemen. Your turn, Gino. Well? You would like something else? He wants something else, Giuseppina. May he? Madam, you owe this man nothing. He cheated. Here is the proof. All the cheat needs to do is distract people's attention. Simply empty a glass... light a cigar... take out a watch. You are not known to us, sir. Who are you? Wilson knows my name. Your jacket. Your watch. Get out of here. Wilson, I demand your resignation. You will leave town today. We're not against pleasure, but no cheat may wear our uniform. For us, you no longer exist. Wilson! Wilson! This is the end of your following me. This is the end of your hounding me to death. This is the end of your torturing me. It's over! Wilson! Wilson... You shouldn't have killed me. Without me, you no longer exist. Dead to the world. Dead to hope. If I die, you die as well. My son... I think it's a relief for you to tell me these nightmares. Promise the Lord never to drink again. Drunkenness makes man like a beast. You don't know what you say or do. - You don't believe me? - Yes, I do. Be sensible. Get some sleep. Tomorrow you'll forget it. You'll be ashamed and ask God's forgiveness. Give up your debauchery. Seek the chaste love of a good wife and you'll no longer suffer these hallucinations which stem from your pride, and only turn you in on yourself. You cretin! You don't believe me. To hell with you! The plane kept circling the airport seemingly unable to decide to land. It was the first time I had been to Rome and I had the odd feeling that this trip, put off for so long was to be very significant in my life. For a moment, I even had the absurd hope that the plane wouldn't land... but would take me far from Rome. It was not to be. The airport's invisible nets had already snared the plane and were dragging it helplessly towards earth. Control tower, request authority to disembark passengers. Mr. Edwards... There he is! Toby Dammit! No! Stop it! Please! Bastard! What a jerk! I'm sorry. Forgive me. All those lights. Those blinding lights... I just can't stand them. It's true. I'm a night person. I hate light. Yes, I hate it. You swore you'd leave me alone. I am Father Spagna. Welcome to Rome. Then you would be... I represent the film production. These are two directors, the Manetti brothers. Maurizio and Ernestino. My secretary... And this is Vicky Rosenthal who will be your guide. I trust you had a pleasant trip. He is not bad at all. Yes, just right for the role. We couldn't have chosen better. Please, step this way. It's the first Catholic Western. Christ's return to the bleak, desolate prairie. And is this not the secret desire of all men? A new incarnation of Christ. in concrete, tangible form. Christ already lives in us, but to show him in a violently mundane context... It may seem a desperate gamble. Blasphemy, almost, I agree. But I know an artist such as you, whether a believer or not, will understand that structuralist cinema can recapture sublime poetry through primal images that are spare, eloquent in their poverty - syntagmatic, as my friend Roland Barthes would say. Something between Dreyer and Pasolini with just a hint of John Ford, of course. As long as it reflects the death throes and decay of our capitalist system... a Western can claim to be militant. That's what Lukacs says. We'll create historical characters sociologically contextualised. Thus, our two outlaws represent irresponsibility and anarchy. The busty girl is the illusory escape into the irrational. The prairie is beyond history and the bisons are man's struggle for subsistence. This film will be in color. Harsh colors, rough costumes to reconcile the holy landscape with the prairie. Sort of Piero della Francesca and Fred Zinneman... An interesting formula. You'll adapt to it very well. Just let your heart speak. The producers promised me a Ferrari - latest model. Where is it? Yes, the Ferrari... You'll get the Ferrari. After the show. You'll get it after tonight's gala. I can't hear you. - Are you going to a funeral? - Take some Librium. Go ahead, don't stay here. Stop the car! I have to speak to him. A thousand lire. Show me. I see luck and happiness. Here, read mine. Curiosity, the need to know... They're very human responses. But to think that one can influence fate... I don't want to. It scares me. I'd rather not know. I had seen her once again. She was waiting for me at the airport. With her big, silent ball. I told her to go away but she kept coming back. She seemed convinced that eventually I'd join in her game. You swore you'd leave me alone. It's nothing. It will pass. Tonight's guest is an English actor who needs no introduction. His last film is still fresh in our minds. He's here now in Rome to act in a film which treats the biblical story of redemption as a Western. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Toby Dammit. What do you want? What's going on? I believe you've never been to Italy before. No. What made you decide to come now? The Ferrari I was promised. Do you use LSD or other drugs? All kinds of drugs. - Why? - To get back to normal. What do you like most in life? No idea. - What do you despise most? - My audiences. Some say you no longer have any audiences. Is that true? How did critics like your Hamlet? understand a thing. Was your childhood unhappy? No. My mother always laughed when she hit me. Not her fault. She drank. I've heard you can't stand criticism and that you have a violent temper. If you repeat that again, watch out for that big nose of yours. Will you marry me? Do you think you're neurotic? It's my one quality. What is amiss in your life, Mr. Dammit? I'm happy and it drives me to despair. Is it true you've done unsavory jobs? Yes... yes... but... l've never been a TV reporter. Pity. - Do you know Italian cinema? - I claim not to. Why do both men and women like you? I'm feminine enough for women... and masculine enough for men. - Why hadn't you visited Italy? - I went to Africa. - Do you think you're witty? - No. Do you? Do you believe in God? No. What about the devil? Yes, in the devil, yes! How interesting! And have you seen him? Yes, I have. Describe him for us. Is he a goat, a bat or a black cat? I'm English... not Catholic. For me the devil is friendly and joyful. He's a little girl. He's a funny fellow. What do you think? If I had your cute looks, I wouldn't have to act the fool. He's certainly ugly... but he makes you laugh. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Italian 0scar presentations. Firstly, I thank the celebrities from show business, politics and the arts who are here tonight. I also thank the Minister of Culture for his telegram... Here's to my producer. Allow me to shake your hand. Bravo, Mr. Dammit. Mr. Dammit, I'm known as D'Artagnan. I do voice imitations. I'm a poet... Can't I even say hello to a friend? This is my daughter Elizabeth. An exceptional child. - Smile, Elizabeth. - Mr. Dammit. Is she a virgin? She's a child, Mr. Dammit, believe it. Lombardi. Assistant producer. They're about to present the Golden She-Wolves on stage. Right after the fashion parade. It would be good if you could just before the awards, say something, recite some poetry. A bit of Shakespeare, perhaps. But keep it short. Make it snappy. The boss is right. Shakespeare's a winner as long as it's not too long. I'm proud to present now the highlight of the collection... "Queen of Sheba." "Nicht Plus Ultra." "Flux within Flux." "Humiliation." "Lady Hamilton." It's your turn, Mr. Dammit. Stay there. I'll be right back. Robert, please go on with your star. I'm your stand-in. Could I have a photo with you? Don't mess this up. Yes, a photo of us three! I know London very well. I'm so glad to be your stand-in. I did Thomas Millan too. I'm a stunt man too. Machine-guns. Keep twenty for me. So, is London great? As far as manners go, the English are lords. You wear a mini-skirt and they don't turn a hair. You'll be more comfortable over here... Just a little glass. No. Calm down. Later on, if everything goes well. You shouldn't drink so much. I am the painter Stagni. I won the prize for the best film script. For "Take Your Carcass Home." You haven't read it? I'm delighted to meet you. I admire you so much. Sit here, darling. The poor fellow is almost blind. Hello! Don't you recognize me? My magazine is putting together a special edition. It will be about the ancient pagan gods. The editors have chosen you to represent the young Greek god Mars. Eight large photos. Almost completely naked. Can I look forward to it? Bravo! And now for tonight's moment of truth. But first let me again thank our distinguished panel who have selected the winners of the highest award. A Golden She-Wolf to Marylou Lolo. Her first film revealed a generous nature and a superlative ease. A Golden She-Wolf to that great duo, the waltzing twins... Lion and Tiger. Come to the microphone, Miki and share your feelings with us. Even if we expect it, it's always an unforgettable moment. I'm overcome with emotion. All I can say is... thank you. And you? I'm overcome with emotion. All I can say is... thank you. I'm overcome with emotion. All I can say is... thank you. Bravo... young ladies! Now let's hear it for the woman who has won everyone's heart... the most warmly human of our actresses. A Golden She-Wolf to Annie Ravel. Hello... And now, please forgive me if my voice trembles more than it should but how can one not be moved when one has the honor of inviting onto this stage... Yes, you've guessed it. An artist who for so many years yes, for so many years has brought us laughter and joy, who has made us laugh by giving his all with the enthusiasm of the truly great artist. You always look so young. Will you say a few words or would you rather mime for us? Don't ask too much of me. Do you know I have a cat's eye? If I heard you correctly, you have a cat's eye. - And how is your sight? - Better than with the other one. Isn't science wonderful? - But it's bad luck for me. - I don't get it. Why? Because I only sleep with one eye. With the other one, I chase mice. Don't be afraid anymore. I'll take care of you. Always. Yes, always. I understand you. I know you. I've always known you. You won't be alone any more because I'll be with you always. Whenever you put out your hand, you will find my hand. You are no longer shipwrecked, no longer a fugitive. No more loneliness. No more selfishness. We will share a life of serenity and devotion. The one you and I were waiting for. You had no faith, but you trusted and found me. I am the one you were waiting for. And I am here with you. For ever. And now we have another wonderful surprise for you. Ladies and gentlemen, Toby Dammit! Bravo... bravo... bravissimo. Come on up, Mr. Dammit. Let me through. Here he is, with us tonight, Toby Dammit, the great English actor who has contributed so much to British film and now honors Italian cinema. It gives me great pleasure to present this statuette which is a symbol of our highest civic honor, to Toby Dammit... incomparable exponent of the art of Shakespeare, one of the giants of world poetry, certainly the greatest after our Dante. Congratulations. May I? It's not true. I'm not a great actor. I assure it's not true. I could have been... But I haven't worked for a year. My last director... my last director complained because... he said I was drunk. Why am I telling you this? Why did you ask me here? What do you want from me? What do you want from me? That woman... She wanted to marry me. It's funny. Doesn't it make you laugh? I just sat there and cried. It often happens to me... especially... when I've been drinking... I cry... yes, I cry. Wine makes me sad. Too much light here. But whisky... whisky is different. It's so strange. A wonderful woman... she took my hand... she stroked my hand. She said "I'm here for you." "I'm the woman of your dreams." But I'm not waiting for you. I'm not waiting for anyone, got it? You give me the shits. Here are the keys. She's been run in. Come back, Mr. Dammit! Hey! How do I get out of here? I want to go to Rome. He's crazy. Where's he going, the idiot? The bridge is down. You have to take the detour. Go back! Take the detour at the mill. The way is closed. Wait! The car.
