Surely you knew this was gonna happen, right? - Seth-- - Shut up. What, did you think you could rat out a guy like me to the cops and get away with it? Is that what you thought? Seth, it's not like that, man. - Shut up, rat. - I'm telling you-- - Shut up. - I wouldn't-- Fuck. I busted my ass to get to the top of the food chain for what? To let a little prick like you tear it down? Seth, I would never rat you out, man. It's gotta be some kind of a mistake. - A mistake? - A mistake. A mistake? Yeah, Nick, it was a mistake. Tell me, was this also a mistake? Hey, Briggs, it's me, Nicky Wilcox. Listen, I just heard Seth Bordas took delivery of 200 lbs of China white. He had it stashed in his club. That's worth something, right? No no no no, Seth. Seth, it's not like that, man. It's that fucking Briggs. He's a snake, man. He's trying to set you up. I was trying to help you. Of course you were, Nick. Of course you were. Of course you were, you stupid prick fuck! I trusted you! I got your sorry ass a job, and this is how you repay me? Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Briggs, you motherfucker! Hey, nothing personal, Nicky. Just business. Gentlemen. Don't get up. Seth, please, man. Seth, listen. I look up to you, man. I look up to you. Look, I'll leave town. I got a wife. I got two kids. I want to see them grow up. I want to see my babies grow up. - Just please-- - Shh shh. Shh. - Seth. - Shh. Nick, I read in a newspaper-- bull sharks, big bull sharks. They swim up the Mississippi from the Gulf searching for food. It's absolutely amazing what an animal will do to survive. Please, Seth, one more chance. Just please. Cement blocks-- old school. I love it. Nicky, you should have taken the hard time. Seth, you got it all wrong. Seth. Please, Seth. It was a mistake. Seth, no! No, Seth! Shit. Yah! Bobby, Bobby, it's Brianna! Oh my God. Oh my God, breathe. Gotcha. Not cool, young lady. I was just practicing for my drama class. I guess I did pretty good, huh? You scared the crap out of your mother and me. You should have seen your faces. That little stunt just got you one month grounded, young lady. A month? That's so unreasonable. A month is a little long, honey. - Fine, two weeks. - Deal. - Daddy. - Honey, quit while you're ahead. Oh my God. - It's your daughter. - That's your daughter. Hey. Daddy, there's some guy at the front door. Hi there. I'm your new neighbor Clay Freeman. I just moved in next door. Hi, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dawn Kalinowski. This is my husband Bobby. Nice to meet you. And our drama queen daughter Brianna. - Hi, neighbor. - Hello. Hey, Bri, put some clothes on. Hey, welcome to the neighborhood. Clay, right? Yes, thanks. Hey, could I possibly trouble you for your hammer? I can't find mine. My wife insists that I hang the wedding photos before I do anything else. Yeah, I can help you with that, providing you've got a driver's license and a major credit card. I don't understand. No, he's kidding. Bobby. Oh. This work for you? Oh, yeah. Glad I could help. Cool. I got this great spot that I do business with downtown-- the best Szechwan in the city. Me and the wife are heading there tonight. You guys want to come with? I'm really not much for going out, Clay, especially to the city. Oh, come on. It'll be fun. What do you say? Let me run it by the boss. I'll get back to you. We'd love to. Remember that one night? Shh. So you guys ever been to the Mayan? The ruins? No, silly, the club. Haven't been there. The owner's one of Clay's biggest clients. Mm-hmm, and I kid you not, the Mayan is so happening. And we're going to be there, so we're happening. Oh, awesome. Honey, I'm driving. Sorry. Hey, guys, I'd be happy to take the wheel if you want the back seat. Yeah. You're so bad. Look at you. Cool, huh? Way cool. There you go. No, don't do it like that. I'm tired of you telling me. No, I'm not-- I know how to do it, okay, honey? Let me show you. You put it in between-- I know that. You told me a million times. But you look like a tourist. You're nitpicking all the time. Forget it. I'm out of here. No no, wait. Look, just sit down. Hey, do you think we should say something? Like what-- "Unhand that woman"? Go on if you want to, Clay, but not me. So is there a problem here? Seth, hey, how are you doing? Clay, good to see you. Seth is the guy I was telling you about. He owns the club. Well, me and the banks. - Hello, Elise. - Hi, Seth. - A pleasure to see you. - You too. Seth, these are my new neighbors-- Kalinowskis. This is Bobby. This is Dawn. Kalinowski-- that's a fine Polish name. Thanks. I got that from my dad. Well, listen, I would love to stay and chat. Please forgive me, but my empire calls. Waiter, this table's all on the arm, a full comp. Thanks, Seth. My pleasure. Enjoy yourselves. I'll call you on Monday with the wine order, okay? Sure thing. Isn't that great? Totally on the arm, totally free. From my experience, Clay, there is no totally free. You end up paying one way or another. Ethan, good. I gotta go do something. I need you to watch the joint while I'm gone. You think you can handle that? Yeah, man, you know you can count on your little bro. Go handle your shit. And no screwing around, you hear me? This is a business. It is not your own personal dating service. Keep your hands off the customers. I got you. Hands off the customers. I got you. I can't help it if I'm a young man with a lot of testosterone. Have a little faith, okay? I got this. Whatever. I love you, you idiot. I love you. I know. I just need to know I can count on you. You can. Good. I'll see you in an hour. See you in an hour. Yeah. What do you think, huh? This place is not too shabby. It has everything. Oh, yeah, drunks, loudmouths and assholes. What more could you ask for? Come on, you're like an old fart. You're still young. Have some fun. Believe me, once we had our daughter, a night without being puked on or changing diapers is a good night. Babies puke on you? Oh, yeah. You're gonna love changing diapers. I didn't think about that. Are you okay? Oh, God. I'm fine. That sushi did a number on my stomach. Oh, well, I'll see you back at the table. Okay. - Oh, sorry. - Oh, my bad. Damn, girl, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, and I've seen some honeys up in here, let me tell you. Oh, thank you. I'm Ethan. I own this club. It's nice to meet you, Ethan. I just met someone upstairs named Seth. He says that he owns the Mayan. Yeah, well, that's my brother. We own it together. I let him handle the food and I take care of all the hospitality. Well, it's nice meeting you, Ethan. Hey, baby, where are you going? You're in my club, so I know you're looking to have a good time. How about you come check out my office? Actually, I can't. I have to get back to my husband. Hey, baby, come on. I'm just trying to be friendly. Come on. You like to slide the ropes? - What? - I got some great shit. What? No, I don't do drugs. Baby, come on. Fucking asshole! I like it rough, the aggressive ones. Get off. Argh! Come on, bitch. Come on. Where's Dawn? I don't know. She left the ladies' room before I did. She should have been back by now. Come on, baby. - Get the fuck off me! - Come on, bitch. No! Fucking get off! Dawn. Dawn, are you in here? No no no! No! Fucking get off! What the fuck? Oh my God. You're fucking dead, you motherfucker. Bobby, look out! Get up, motherfucker. Come on, asshole. Oh my God. Oh, shit. We have a big problem. He had it coming. No, you don't understand, Bobby. That's Ethan. That's Seth's brother. This is not good. This is not good. Gentlemen. Looks like you had a good day, huh, Briggs? So what do I need to know? Well, everything's good right now, but you need to screen your boys a little more carefully. You got lucky today. I was able to intervene. You might not be so lucky next time. Yeah, right. Rat bastards. Can't trust anybody nowadays, can you, Briggs? Jesus fucking Christ, what did he do now? Look, I gotta roll. It's my little brother again. Ethan. The little bastard can't keep his prick in his pants. Just remember what I said, Seth. You can count on it. Let's roll. I need you to calm down and tell me what happened. - Can't come in here, sir. - The hell I can't. I'm Seth Bordas. This is my club. Sir, please please. - What happened? - Are you Seth Bordas? That's right. What happened? I'm sorry, Mr. Bordas. Your brother's dead. Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Ethan! Get out of here. Ethan! Ethan! Who did this? Who did this? You menace! He asked me if I wanted to go to his office and do some coke, and I said no. Dawn left the ladies' room before me. And when I got back to the table she wasn't there. Bobby got worried, so he went to look for her. - Why stab him? - What are you talking about? I didn't stab him. He came at me with the knife. So it was his knife? Yeah, of course it was his knife. How did his knife end up in his chest? How did that happen? I stepped to the side. He tripped and fell on it, I guess. This guy was out of his mind. I was just defending myself. Can you be a little more specific? What do you want me to say, that he tried to rape me? Suppose I told you I had a witness who says you did stab him? I'd say you and your witness are full of shit. So are you charging me with something or am I out of here? Just sit tight. Can I get you anything-- a water, a coffee? My wife. I want to see my wife. Where is she? You're gonna see her. So what do you think? The stories match. He hasn't lawyered up. I think it's just like he's saying-- self-defense. Bordas was a train wreck anyway. This was another one. Ain't that the truth? If old Ethan was found dead in a ditch, we wouldn't have the personnel to interview all the likely suspects. Right. What about fingerprints? The only fingerprints on that knife belonged to Ethan Bordas. Okay, cut him loose. Briggs. Talk to me. What did you find out? It looks like self-defense. Look, you know Ethan better than anybody. What? I want that rat bastard's head on a stake. You hear me, Briggs? You hold on to him until you fucking hear from me. Too late. We just released him. God damn it! Listen, Seth. Don't do anything stupid. If anything happens to this guy, cops will be all over you and there won't be a damn thing I can do about it. Son of a bitch! Seth. Fuck. Looks like I gotta take care of this myself. Want us to go pick him up? It's too late for that. That idiot Briggs let him go. All right, I want you to put a word out on the street-- who brings me Bobby Kalinowski. This city is officially on lockdown. What about your friend the booze guy? He brought death into my house. If he gets in the way, kill him. But I want Bobby Kalinowski alive. Now get out of here. Y'all down? For 100 grand I'd get Seth Bordas my mom. - For 100 grand? - Yeah. - Let's get this paper, man. - Let's do that. All right then. Y'all down? Sounds good. What the hell is going on? Come on, asshole. - Oh, shit. - Get us out of here, Clay. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Clay, get us out of here. - But I might hit someone. - Clay, go now. Oh, shit. - Clay. - Okay. Go! Pull into that parking garage. - Dawn, call 911. - I'm not getting any service. Right there, Clay. Back it in by those cars. Bobby, what are you doing, man? I'll distract them. Clay, get the girls out of here. - Take them to the police station. - I'm not gonna leave you. - Dawn, please. - Forget it. Okay, listen, I'll meet you at 7th and Oak in 10 minutes. Don't wait one second longer. Oh my God, Bobby. What's this guy, a freakin' human spider or what? Aim for the legs. Seth wants him alive. Cops. Shit! It's been 10 minutes. We're not leaving him, Clay. Oh my God, Bobby. - Oh my God, are you hurt? - It's nothing. Come on, baby, I've hurt myself worse shaving. Relax relax relax. We gotta go. - Clay, Elise, out of the car. - Okay. I'm not leaving my car in this neighborhood. They know this car. Come on, man. I'm sorry. Leave it. Let's go. Come on. I'm fine. I'm fine. We gotta go back to the police station. So how do you know he was dead if you didn't check him? He fell off the side of a building and splattered like a bug. Briggs, what did you find out? Understood. Let me know when you find him. Nobody-- but nobody could have survived that fall. You stupid fucking moron. I tell you I want him alive and you try to kill him. Now I find out you can't even do that. Apparently, you both don't know the difference between dead or alive. Markus. It's really not that difficult. Dead. Alive. Dead. Alive. Dead. No! We'll get him, I swear! Alive. Say, Chris, let me see that GPS, nigga. No, man, I ain't giving you my GPS. I just got this jump-off, man. Man, give me the GPS. Quit bullshitting, man. We don't need no GPS. These motherfuckers is on foot, with some bitches. They can't be no further than a couple of blocks north of Washington. Oh, so you're a compass now? Look, man, let's do this the "G" way. Let's hit these streets. Feel me? Ask a few people. That's straight, boss. Let's bounce, man. Damn right, that's straight. Let's roll, my nigga. Shit, still no signal. Okay, the police station is two blocks that way. I think if we cut through here, we won't be seen. Damn it, Clay, get back here. You'll get spotted. I think I'm getting a signal. Clay. Don't even think about moving. Put your fucking hands up in the air, stupid. Hey, D, call T. Let him know we got him. Make sure he got that cash A.S.A.P. Got you, my nigga. Make sure we get paid. Hey, man, what are you doing out here, black, huh, hanging out with these cats? Don't you know you could get six feet deep for that? You're hanging out with "America's Most Wanted." You're a dead man walking, homie. D, what's up with T, man? He got that cheese? Yeah, that's right. Cheese? Money. I have money. I have $500 cash. $500? That man right there is worth 100 grand. But since you're feeling so generous and all, you want to give me $500, as a matter of fact I'll take that, and your watch and your ring. Give me all that shit. That's a polo jacket, huh? Oh, yeah yeah, give me all of that shit. Andale andale, nigga. Move. You two, muscle-man. I want your shit too. Let's go. The credit cards-- all of it. Give me that shit. What the fuck are you laughing at, man? I bet it won't be so funny if I put this gun in your mouth, boy. So what the fuck are you laughing at? That's right, bitch. Your ass is worth 100 grand on the streets right now. So what you think about that? You guys like working for minimum wage? I should pop your ass right now. Shoot me-- you lose the 100K and the diamonds. Diamonds? What you talking about-- diamonds, man? We don't know nothing about no diamonds, man. The diamonds that are stuffed in my sock. What do you think this is about? You think we're stupid? No, you're a genius. Here, see for yourself. Hey hey hey, don't move, boy. You almost got shot right now. Don't be moving. Chris man, you think he's serious about these diamonds, man? I mean, that just don't make no sense to me. He's in this neighborhood at this time with a whole bunch of diamonds? What do you think, dawg? Maybe that's what Bordas wanted him for-- the diamonds. Diamonds could be a lot more green than Seth's paying. What you think about that? I don't know. Check it out. - All right, you got me? - I got you. All right. Keep your hands up, man. Clay, get in the car. Let's go, ladies. Where did you learn to fight like that? I watched a lot of Jackie Chan movies. Get in the car. What are you doing? I'm taking my cheese and my watch. We've come a long way from slavery to Obama. You need to stop using the "N" word. It's disrespectful. Excuse me, we need to see someone in charge. That'd be me. Can I help you? - Yeah, I'm Bobby Kalinowski. - Kalinowski? - That's right. - Come with me. Wait, we were just attacked-- Ma'am, please just follow me. Okay, you want to tell me what's going on? Seth Bordas is trying to kill us. Trying to kill you? He paid 100,000 to have us killed. And you have proof of that? The guys who attacked us said they were hired by Bordas. - Attacked you? - We were held at gunpoint. Listen, I'm gonna get some detectives in here to take your statements. You know what? How about this-- no more detectives, no more statements. - Let's go home. - I cannot help you unless you're willing to file charges. That's okay. I don't need your help. Special Services. Why didn't you say something in the first place? Didn't think it was necessary. Okay, look, I will personally look into your story and I'll get back to you as soon as I find out something, okay? At least let me get you a ride home. Come on. - Here you go. - A cab? Aren't you gonna take us home in a police car? Sorry, department policy. But don't worry. The city will pick up the tab. Cool. My cell number's on the back of this. If you need anything, give me a call. Thank you, Detective. Look at you. A rough night, eh? Are you sure you know where you're going? Yes, ma'am, I know it well. Not a lot of people go to the 'burbs. I go over the bridge, take the back road, Sycamore-- Hey, you mind keeping your eyes on the road? Oh, yes, sir. I hope my car is okay. Must be the wife. You're not taking the freeway? No. Yes, sir. I have to go to a gas station. I have to relieve myself real quick. You couldn't have done that before you picked us up? Sir, nature calls when nature calls, okay? Make it quick. Yes, sir, I will. Just make it fast. I will, I promise. I'll be very quick. Sure you don't want to grab a sandwich while you're at it? No, thank you. I already have eaten. Oh, we got company. Lock the door. I'm not a fan of downtown. Bobby, what are you doing? Stay in the car. Going someplace, buddy? I'm actually just on my way home. You guys seem to have accidentally blocked me in. Would you mind moving? You're a real funny guy, huh? But you're coming with us, man. You know, I am really not having a good night tonight. Up until now I think I've done a pretty good job of keeping my sense of humor. But I feel like I'm starting to lose it. So how about this? How about you take your gang of goofballs here and you get out of my way before you find out what happens when I lose my sense of humor? Maybe you really need to take that up with Animal over here. Yeah? You must be Animal. Animal's a big dude. Yeah, real big. I bet you can help me get all these fellows out of my way. Tell you what, Animal-- I got another idea. Pick a hand. Why don't we just fuck your ass up? Go get him, you big ape. Come on. Back the fuck up. Let him go. Back the fuck up. Hang on. Hey, what are you doing? We gotta separate. It's only me they're after. - Wait, Bobby, no. - Clay, I need you to take the wheel. I don't think this is a good idea, Bobby. Please don't leave me. Come on, man, listen to your wife. You should stay with us. What? I don't-- Clay, I need you to get in the front seat now. Bobby, this is absolutely crazy. Honey, listen, I'll be fine. I need you to just go home and wait for me, okay? I'll see you there shortly. Clay, get them out of here. Don't stop for anything. Don't trust anyone. - I'm counting on you. - What are you gonna do? Call in an old debt. Where's BR? He's over there. What the fuck is it that you don't understand? You were short two cases of vodka in my last order. I want my booze or I want my fucking money back by Friday. Jesus fucking Christ. I must look like some asshole that everybody wants to fuck. What's up, BR? Bobby fucking K at my place. I know this is gonna be good. I need to talk to you, bro, alone. Can you believe this guy? I haven't seen him in 100 years and he comes in here barking orders. We're not in the navy anymore. And you're not in charge here. This is my place. What's the matter? Don't like girls? Ronnie. That's all right, go ahead. How about a dance? No, thank you. Your loss. What are you doing on this side of town anyway, Bobby? I thought you were a family man now. I don't want to be down here. A neighbor invited Dawn and I to a club and I got into some trouble. What kind of trouble? You know this guy Seth? - Bordas? - Yeah, that's him. He put 100 grand on my head. You're the guy that killed Ethan. I didn't kill him. Look, Bobby man, anybody but Seth fucking Bordas. I can't help you, bro. I'm sorry. BR, maybe you got a short-term memory, but you owe me. Look, man, you heard of "Three strikes and you're out"? I've got four. I'm sorry. Maybe you don't remember, but you wouldn't be alive to get those strikes if it wasn't for me. Yeah, I remember. You don't remember. Where have you been all these years? You got a wife now, a daughter, right? Have I ever met them? Hell no. When was the last time you popped your head in here and said, "Hey, Big Ronnie, want to come over for dinner?" How about never? So don't walk in here like we're family. You know what? Why don't you just get the fuck out of here before I collect that bounty myself? Do you want us to come in and wait with you? No no no. I'm gonna be all right. We're right next door if you need anything. Please let us know the minute you hear from Bobby, okay? Okay, I will. Bye. You gotta stop tearing up the town, Seth. Let it go. I can't let it go. I want to know where Bobby Kalinowski lives. I'm sorry, Seth, I can't do that. Oh, so what do we got here? A crooked cop with a conscience? Is that what you're telling me? Look, I have some new information on this Kalinowski. He was Department of Defense for 10 years. So he served in the military. What do I care about that? No, I checked his service records. He was a Navy SEAL. I don't give a flying fuck who or what he is. He killed my brother, and for that he's gonna pay. Seth, I don't think you understand the level of training and skill that it takes to be a SEAL. As far as killers go, this guy is the elite of the elite. I've handled trained killers before. No, not like this, you haven't. Look, I'm not gonna go back and forth with you on this, all right? I want you to give me his address, or I'm gonna go public with your second income. You understand me? You do that-- you go down with me. So be it. Now you stay out of my way. Deacon, change of plans. Nowhere to run now, huh? You're not gonna be able to fight your way out of this one, Mr. Badass. This does not look good for me, does it? Who are you kidding, man? You don't know how to shoot that thing. What did you say, motherfucker? All right. Hold him up. What the fuck, man? That's enough. Bordas wants him alive. Sorry, Bobby. a lot of money. The club ain't doing too good these days. Are you fucking kidding me? You set me up? Hey, guys, hold him down. He may not look like much, but this guy is a trained killer. You piece of shit, I took a bullet for you. Whatever, hero. Look, this ain't personal, man, just business. You fucking piece of shit. I should have let you die out there. You know, you really need to stop living in the past. See you, Bobby. Hey, what happened to "No man left behind"? Over here, tough guy. I took a bullet for you! Stop making this hard on yourself. This ain't nothing compared to what Seth will do to you. Let him go. What? I changed my mind. Let him go. What the fuck is wrong with you, man? I said, I changed my mind. Let him go. Let him go. - Go fuck yourself. - Go fuck myself? - Yeah, I'm taking him in. - You're taking him in? - I'm fucking taking him in. - You're taking him in? He's worth $100 fucking thousand. I'm taking him in. - Am I not speaking English? - I don't give a fuck what you're speaking, you big goofy motherfucker. I said I'm taking him-- Telling me to go fuck myself? I thought we were friends. What? What? You're sorry? Apology not fucking accepted. Fucking piece of shit. All right. Who wants to die first? Just like old times, huh? Go ahead, man. Get out of here. These guys aren't going anywhere. Thanks, man. Hey, this wasn't a favor. We're even. Honey, I'm worried about Bobby out there all alone. I should have done more to help him. Damn it. Baby, Clay, try and get some sleep, okay? I feel like a coward. I didn't do anything to help. Baby, yes, you did. You got us home safely. Did you see the way he took on some of those guys? There's more to him than what it appears to be. What do you mean? He's no landscape architect. That guy is a trained killer. Bobby, Bobby, I'm so glad to see you. What happened, man? Hey, man, how's Dawn? She's inside. She's fine. I got us here okay. Thank you, buddy. Where did you get the bike, man? Go back to bed, all right, buddy? I promise I'll tell you all about it in the morning, okay? Okay, we'll catch up in the morning. I want to know everything, the whole story. Good night, man. Wow, you're the man. Dawn? Dawn. Oh my God. Bobby, thank God. - They took Brianna. - Who did? - Those two guys from the Mayan. - Bordas's men? They said that they were gonna kill her - if you didn't come and rescue her. - Where did they go? The abandoned pier by the bridge. Bobby, please. I'm gonna kill that motherfucker. No, wait, Bobby, wait. No no, just wait a minute. Bobby, wait. Bobby, what are you doing? No, Bobby, I'm begging you, please don't do this. Bobby, just call the police. Why don't you call Detective Briggs, see if he can help? Honey, I need you to go back in the house. - I know what I'm doing. - You know what, Bobby? I don't think that you do know what you're doing. Dawn, I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. Go back in the house. - Briggs. - Detective Briggs, Seth Bordas's men broke into our house and took our daughter. Mrs. Kalinowski? All right, listen, calm down. Tell me everything you know. When my dad gets here, he's gonna kick your ass, meatheads. Not likely. It's not nice to talk to people like that, kid. Didn't your daddy teach you anything? And I'm not a meathead. I went to community college. Did you graduate? No. Put that down. Watch out. Hello, sweetheart. My name is Seth. I'm a friend of your father's. I gotta pee. I'm sorry, dear, that just isn't gonna happen. Fine, then I'll just go right here. Deacon, take her. This way. Move it. Is everybody in position? Yes, sir. Perfect. Right here. Thanks. Hey, look over there. Yeah, right. - Oh my gosh. - What? That's something my dad taught me. Who's the meathead now? Come on. What the hell happened to you? The little bitch kicked me in the balls, and then she took off running. Idiot. Let me tell you something, Deacon-- you let her get away again, and you're gonna be wearing your balls for earrings. You get me? You big moron. Stop. Ow. You're hurting me. Stop. Shut up. Would you do something about her? Let her go. Ah, Officer Briggs. Welcome to the party. I said let the kid go. I don't take orders from you. It's none of your business. Why don't you do what you do best-- look the other way? Are you out of your fucking mind-- grabbing a kid, kidnapping? What the fuck are you thinking? Would you look at this? A crooked cop with a conscience-- how heroic. Seth, looking the other way on a drug deal is one thing. Grabbing a kid-- you're over the line. Oh, am l? Because of that kid's father, Ethan's dead. The universe has to balance. That girl's father is a war hero. Your brother's a world-class asshole. Where's the balance in that? Don't you fucking call my brother an asshole. Oh, come on, man. Your brother's a smartass coke freak that pisses people off for a living, you included. Stop it. Who do you think told Nicky Wilcox what's on that tape, huh? I'll tell you who. It was Ethan. Ethan's popping off to Nicky and, dumb luck for you, the junkie calls me. You shut the fuck up now, Briggs. Ethan Bordas always wanted to be big brother Seth, always wanted to be you, resenting the fact that he would never be anything than your little brother. Truth is, that kid was so sick of being in your shadow that he had to get himself killed to craw out from under it. Seth, your brother-- Shut up! Ethan wasn't my brother. What? He wasn't my brother. He was my son-- my son. You hear me? My son. When I was 16 I was fooling around with the girl upstairs and she got pregnant. Her parents wanted her to get rid of the kid, but my mother wouldn't have it. So when Ethan was born we took him in and she told everybody that he was hers. So you see, Briggs, me grabbing the kid of the guy that killed my kid makes perfect sense. Seth, it's not gonna bring your son back. Now I can fix this. It's not too late if you just give me the girl. And we go back to doing what we do best-- making money. Okay. All right. All right. Take her. It's okay, sweetie. It's over. You'll be home soon. I lied, cop. I never like that piece-of-shit cop anyway. Bordas, if my daughter isn't released in five seconds, this next shot goes through your head. Don't move, Kalinowski, or I'll kill your daughter. Go ahead. What? I said go ahead. Then I'm gonna shoot your boss right between his eyes. Let her go, Deacon. Do what he says. I knew you'd come and save me. - You okay, Bri? - I am now. So what now, war hero? Are you gonna shoot me? Well, that's up to you. I don't want to, but if you keep coming after me, what choice do I have? You win. Call your men off. It's over. Bobby Kalinowski's free to go. Let's go, baby. Go after them. Come here. Bri, listen to me. We need to hide you for a little while. - Oh. - I know, baby. I'm sorry. You'll be safe in here. - I love you, baby. - I love you too, Daddy. Go kick their asses. All I want to know is, did you get him yet? Almost. We got him cornered down at the new pier. No sign of the girl, though. Almost? What if I almost put my foot up your ass? Yes, sir. Move. Come on, Kalinowski, get up. Daddy? Not really. Hello again, sweetheart. - Big Ronnie. - Hey. I'm glad to see you. What took you so long? A strong current. Hey, go get your daughter, man. I got this. Yeah? Are you sure? What do you think he weighs, about a buck fifty? Yeah, you got him. You really need that? I was thinking the same thing. Come here. Shut up. Trouble! Oh, yeah, big trouble. Let her go, Seth. - No. - Let her go. No, you took my child. I'm gonna take yours. What? No, Bordas, Ethan took his own life when he decided to attack my wife. Shut up, shut up. All right, your move, big man. What are you gonna do now, kill us both? No. Just you. Daddy. You okay, baby? Wow. Brianna, meet Big Ronnie. Ronnie, Brianna. It's a pleasure to meet you finally. Hey, man, thank you. All right. I guess this makes us even, huh? No, we're not even. I saved your ass, like, three times. You only saved me once. Even? I saved you in the park. I saved you from those two fat guys. I saved you from ninja boy. Save me, like two more times before we're even. Wait, the park? You set me up in the park. Yeah yeah yeah. You still owe me. Who's he? An old war buddy, baby. Well, he's cool. Yeah, he's cool. But you're cooler. But his tattoos were awesome. I want one. - No, no tattoos. - Please, Daddy, come on. We're not gonna talk about this, Bri. Just one, one little one.
