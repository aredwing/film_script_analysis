The winner of the Bapu Contest Mr. Shankar Prasad is in our Studio today... Hi Shankar Prasad... - Hi Jahnavi! How do you know these many things about Gandhiji? I like Gandhiji very much! Because... there is no Pistol in his Hand! He doesn't have atleast Button Knife... Holding a small stick... he had driven the English people upto the Border! Else... Our country would have been damaged! Spoiled... Spoiled! It sounds like our Shankar's voice. Increase the Sound a bit! But... we have forgotten Gandhiji now, haven't we? You are a good girl... If we forgot... why would we make the October 2nd as the Dry day closing the Wine shops? Though it is not dry day I don't touch the Drink! Not at all So... Are you still following his way? - Yes... I would be walking on the Gandhi Road for 2-3 Kilometres Everyday! Joke apart... I asked you if you were following his Principles... - Yes... To tell you perfectly... I am No.1 in following Gandhiji Non-Vilolence! Do you mean Gandhi Qualities? The opposite to Rowdism is Gandhi's Non-Violence! Would you also follow it? Not like you... I follow a few! Like... Like... I never lie... WoW... Our opinions are matching! Excuse me... We shall meet now and then! Have you never lied? - I have said only once... In 1992! When a kid was crying as he lost the 50 Paise coin... I had given my 50 Paise and said it was his! That's it... he had stopped Crying! That was the first and last lie said by me... Write down... He will definitely enter into the Politics! What do you do? I am asking you... - Professor! You are talking like something then... I can talk Telugu very nicely if I think... Youth... The youth guys are damaging our Telugu... that is spoiling! If we say Repentance... They think it's Heart Attack! Just for them... That means? - Don't you know English? Like peeling off the Banana and feeding... I would get down to their stage and teach... Oh! Would you talk purposely like this to make your students understand? Yes ofcourse... Do you know onething? All stand first in my class... Yes... though I ask them to come 2nd or 3rd! No one comes... It's good! I will also try to talk in your Style from today... If we meet like this outside everyday I will teach you many things! Mr. Shankar... tell me! Which Song would you ask us to play for your Students on behalf of you? Agood raging... - Gandhi's Song, right? Yes... you are right! You said the same what I have thought... Our Hearts have matched well... Our thoughts are matching like the Dishes... Over the desire of the Professor We shall listen to a good Song! From the movie called... Thief Ramu! No problem... No problem! It's a good programme. I don't know if my children listened or not! Children? - Yes... I have got 5 children! Why is here brother? Work has been done Come on let's go! - Okay. You... My name is Paruchuri Venkateswar Rao. Sir's student! Look... They are my children!

There is no room in any House for this Father! You have taken 2 hours to tell this word... It happens in every door step, right? He is very sentimental guy ...he may disturb us! We shall give a seperate room for him! This is the problem with the Old people... What I have said doesn't seem to have been taken seriously... What then? In this 2nd Innings House Weeping has been banned! 2nd Innings House? We have spent our 1 st Innings life in surviving... Yes... ln this 2nd Innings, we should not think that why we are still alive... We have to use this period to live peacefully and to fulfill small desires! I like to fly in Aeroplane once...

She will ask everything about Cinema... We are Kings in that, right? If you try out there... the total routes will be clear! How do I look like to you? Do I lool like trapping anyone else? If so... there is no other go brother! There are still 5 days left for Sunday... For these 5 days... Study about Gandhiji whatever you want to study sitting in the Library! Walking Style... Here? Hello... Hey Brother... Is there anybody here? Who are you? What do you want? I am the attender Subbaiah here... Nothing Sir... There is a Old man by name Gandhi, right? There you see... lt's he! Is matter available here about him? What are you staring at? Haven't you understood? You are the only one asked after a long time. I am very happy! All the books written about Gandhiji would be available here... You keep reading... I will send tea! - Thanks! Oh father! How many books they are! Vandemataram... Chant of Gandhi! Vandemataram... Chant of Gandhi! With the Spectacles and the Walking Stick A Passive Resistance has moved! The adventure beyond the Youth with the Powerful Head like the Silver Mountain... The immovable Heart of Gandhi has the seed of desire... The Blood of the Freedom has started pressure in the Nerves... The Innocent Leader has not acted beyond the Truth! The Crown of the Foreigners has shivered to face him... Shankar! Who is that? - Mohan Das Karam Chand Gandhi... Look Uncle... I have been reading without sleeping for 3 days... Don't disturb me unnecessarily! - What would you do Shankar? I leave you as you are Old man... Else... If you hit on one Cheek... I will show you the second Cheek! Professor! Professor...

I have not done any harm to anybody... Boss! It is confusing me... you are not his Spirit, are you? I am not Spirit... you take me as Conscience! Why should I think Boss? - Not Boss... lt's Bapu! You like Jahnavi very much, right? How would you know that matter? Subbaiah... Don't get tensed Shankar... I will go away if you shout like this! But, remember onething! Mr. Subbaiah! Whenever you I am required... you just think of me! I will come and help you! - Mr. Subbaiah! What happened? Look who there is... Nothing is there... Halogination! - What is that? That means... If a man is under enormous pressure. Chemical imbalance takes place in mind! Because of that Some things which are not there seem to be seen and things that are there seem to be not seen! That is Halogination! I say I have seen clearly... I don't say Bapu has come alive... I say he has come in the form of Spirit and talked to me... If it's true what you say... It would have been seen by the Tea guy, right? Here you see Master... - Doctor! Anything else... Don't you watch movies? It appears to whoever is to appeared! Since you have been reading for 3 days without having food and drink... it might have been seen like that! Don't worry... I will prescribe some medicines... It will be cured! Buy those medicines and you swallow... Here you see Doctor! I will show you the Bapu now itself! He asked me to think when required and said he would come! Shankar! Bapu! Have you come? - you have called me, haven't you? I have come to help you... - Look... Look at Bapu! Don't believe if I say... There is none Mr. Shankar! - You say there is none... Bapu is seen clearly for me! Your eyes might have been spoiled! What are you talking? It's all your lmagination. Don't you understand if I say so? Hey ATM... Don't you see Bapu? Brother will not be afraid of anyone... But you make him scared being seen! Hey... Hey ATM... - Brother! Bapuji sits on Sofa... Here! - Apple... Apple! Bapuji... Apple? - Take it Bapu... Ask for Coffee... Tea or Cool Drinks! Don't hesitate... What is this Drama? Are you kidding? I say it's all imagination... Why do you encourage him? Shut up... lf I give you one! If it's seen to Brother... It's seen, that's it! That is Rediculous! Brother... you talk with Bapu! You move I say! Hey... Mental Hospital! I know there is no Bapu... But... Brother's brain gets spoiled if we say there is none! That's why we have to act as if there is he... Give me the Prescription! Hey ATM... - Brother! Why is Bapu seen only for our both? That's why Bapu has come out of the Book... He watches how the Country is! If he watches... it's mother! He will go back again into the Book! Stop thinking brother... Have it! Bapu said he had come to help me... Brother! Rajalingam has asked us to vacate the House, right? We shall send Bapu to there... Shit... Bapu will not do such things! That's right! Brother... Have medicines brother! Bapu! What should this Bapu do to Shankar? Here you see Bapu! Where is my Quarter? You have to do me a favour... If it is to hit or kill anyone... I can't! Not that one... You have to come to Jahnavi's House along with me tomorrow... You have to be seen only for me... not to anyone else there... Like in Vittalacharya Movie! Bapu... whatever they ask me about you... whisper in my ear! I will look after the rest... Because... I am a bit weak in History, right? Would you please do me a favour too? Tell me Bapu... Has anyone occupied your Palace? I will make him vacate within minutes... You don't flicker at all! Not that one... It's not such an easy task to do what I say! Alas! Bapu... there is no Rowdy existing than us in Hyderabad! You tell me what your work is and forget It will get finished! Okay... I will first help you! I will say what I want later... It's enough Bapu... Thank you... Good Night! Hey ATM... Brother! - Work is finished! Jahnavi! I am coming... you see! My question... Before talking about Gandhi... let's all close our eyes and remember him! Bapu... have you come? Thank you... You have to look after me... It's enough... Ask me whatever doubts you have towards Gandhiji! Brother... A guy in the Park threw a stone and broke the hand of Gandhiji yesterday... When I asked him why he had done so He answered me recklessly! What is the solution for this? Very Simple... Bringing him and making him stand before the statue... Giving another stone to his hand and ask him to break my whole statue! What Bapu? What do you say? - Tell them what I say... Bapu... - Tell them Shankar! Give another stone to the guy and ask him to break the whole statue... Like wise... Destroy all my statues across the country! Break all the statues of Gandhiji across the country! Remove my names from the National Highways and the Buildings! Remove the names of Gandhiji from the Roads and the Buildings! To really follow my foot steps... those are not required! It's enough placing me your Heart... Correct! If you really want to follow the Gandhiji foot steps... these are not required! Place him into your Heart... that's enough! What else he has done for us? He had avoided eating. gone to Jail! He had travelled all over this Country with only one Dhoti! Finally... he had borne the Bullets too! Here... Here he had been shot! But... what are we doing? Fitting him in a Photo frame... Hanging on the wall... we do all the unrighteous things under that! How great he thought this Country should be! But... What are we doing? We are spoiling this Country... Do you say the Country has been spoiled that much? The approximate development is seen, right? My Hole development... - What is the development? Development in Hitting... Development in Final death... Development in committing Suicide... Development in robbing this Country... There will be Pump... But there will be no water! There will be Bulb... But there will be no power! If we go to Hospital... there will be no bed available! In case we get the bed... the Doctor won't be available! If we come across any problem and go to the Leader... He will divert us to go to the Officer! If we go to the Officer it would be said he's in the meeting! If we call him to home it would be said he's in Bath room! When he is available... He asks us to put an Application! When the application is given... it will round you see! Though Gandhiji comes and stands in Election... There is no doubt Gandhiji would be defeated by doing malpractices! Our Country is developed to that stage! Bapuji would say one word when he was alive... The Country is ours... But the people have become foreigners! Thank you! Thanks! Hey Professor! Have it! - Okay... What Sir? I have been noting... Your looks fall different side while you were talking with us! What is the matter? Where? - There! Jahnavi! - You love Jahnavi, don't you? Me... no... no... I promise! - Don't lie... That feelings are seen in your Eyes... My Eyes have some defect... look! Don't pretend! You fear to express your Love towards her, right? I also fear... - You? Be calm... - It's true! - No... Her name is Tina... We both were lovers in Intermediate... My father was the Villain at that time... So... he must have said 'No' for the Marriage! - He has said! She has married someone else... But Tlna's husband has passed away! Your wife then... - Same... Passed away! So... Vacancy on both sides! What then? You can marry her, right? Children are not accepting if I get married in this age! Then my father... Now my Children! Villains... Don't I have my own liberty? Look! Forty Years ago... when it was raining! I had kissed Tlna... She had run away feeling shy! Hurray! The same car... Since it has such a flash back we named it as Kissing Car! Tell me whenever you need Car I will give the Keys! What Buddy? What happened Buddy? Tell me quickly... Tender Expenses! It has been fixed for the mighty guy on the Earth and the Angel in Heaven! The match has been fixed! - What Buddy? What happened Buddy? It has been mixed for the Gang Leader and the Parrot... The taste has been mixed! - What Buddy? What happened Buddy? In the Back Seat... In the Kissing Car... In the Back Seat... ln that Kissing Car! She has given me only one Puppy... Brother! Does Puppy mean the Young Dog? - Hey... Puppy means Kiss in Hindi! Hey... She has kissed our Brother! What is this Kissing Car Brother? I know Shaukar... Patkar... Oscar... I even know what Baker is... - That is our Intelligence! Why don't you start the Story of this Kissing Car? I will start... Will you listen to? Filling the Diesel in the Engine We have gone for a Film in the Evening! In the Interval... I have held the hand and given Popcorn to the Baby! Sitting has been adjusted The Pair has been set bit by bit... The Power has gone in the Cinema Hall Another Cinema has been started for the Body! I went intoxicated... I felt very good... She has boarded the Car and given the Kiss! Brother! You have shown me the picture and made me go mad... You are not the Ordinary guy... Brother! Dada... Dada... Dada... Dada! Shankar Dada... Shankar Dada... Shankar Dada Zindabad! Shankar Dada Zindabad! Yours is not the One day match... Iooks like a Test match!

I don't have sentiments! My daughter's marriage is going to take place... Don't come against that! Saying you don't have sentiments. Aren't you showing your Daughter sentiment? Similarly... that house is sentiment for them! They have cut the relation with the Children and grown relation with that Home! If you want... I will vacate any Minister's home! Leave that Bungalow! - Okay... I leave it! You also leave that girl... I will get you married with any Miss India! Don't bring Jahnavi into the Picture... You also don't bring the Love into the Business! This is not warning... It's an Advice! If so... I won't leave you! I won't leave that Bungalow too... This is not Advice... It's a Warning! Professor! Those old men were taken to Tour by you... That House has been vacated by your Guys... What would you tell your Lover? I can tell her... that you are not a Professor! And you have made your guys vacate the house... How is it? Didn't you understand? You can't swallow... You can't vomit too! That is your position! Jahnavi! Hello... Hello! Jahnavi here! Will you talk with her? Rosy! - Sorry... wrong number! Go... Go and mind your Business! Sorry brother! It had been a big fight... I thought of making a call to you before vacating the House... As it was a small task... not to disturb you... you don't get tensed Brother... I will talk with Sister-In-Law! He says he would talk... he would talk! What would you say? Would you say I am a Rowdy? Would you say we have vacated that house? you don't do any work properly... Go man! Shankar! How are you honey? Do you need my help after a long time? Bapu! I have been stuck in a big problem in life... Give me some idea and take me out... There is a way... Abduct the daughter of Rajalingam... Tell him you would leave her if he returns the Bungalow! I got this idea yesterday itself ...I struck it off! If so... Strike off Rajalingam! What Bapu? You are also kidding... Have I been found to make weep? - All these are your Ideas... You have done these all the days, haven't you? You won't come onto my way anyhow... What is the use of saying? Okay Bapu... Tell me what your way is... I will try in that route only! - No... You can't! Why can't I? It's not such an easy task to follow my way... But... lt's sure to win! - Will that Bungalow come again to us? It will definitely come... Jahnavi will not leave me, will she? She will not... She will be with you life long! The power of the Truth is so! If you have such a confidence Tell me Bapu what I should do! You have to ask for Apologize first... - To Whom? Bapu... Do you say it is mandatory? I want to see how bold you are... - That means? It's very easy to pain or hit anybody... But... it needs more bravery to ask for Apologizes! Go... What are you doing here? Nothing Brother... I remembered my Mother in the morning! That's why I have come here and sat... I want to talk with you... - Tell me Brother! You turn that side once... I am not able to talk looking into your eyes! I have to say Sorry to you... I remembered our old memories and could not sleep! Do you remember? Once when my Leg was shot with Bullet... You were serving me without sleeping for a week! As it is so... I have handled you! Once taking my blames. you have been hit by the Police! As it is so... I have handled you! Why is it now brother? You have hit me since you have the feeling of Brother! you have that right! Don't make me go far saying Sorry... Don't think otherwise... okay? Bapu! I have said sorry... My Heart feels very free now! Tell me Bapu... what to do next? You have to get Rajalingam also on the track like this lovely... Bapu... Do you say it will work out? It will work out Shankar... This Bapu is here, isn't he? Okay... Okay... - I leave! What should we do now? You have all come to me, right? That's it... Is that it? - Uncle... Uncle! How many days will it take for the House to be ours? That is... - It takes as less as Ten years! There is nothing like that Madam... It takes maximum 6 months! Would you write down a Guarantee Paper like that? That is... It may go beyond or below 3 more months! We can't say... Beyond or Below? Look Brother... lt's the matter of Court! Judge may get transfered... Adate may move forward! How long? - It may take 4-5 years... That means... lf it's 4-5 years... Okay... Adding a year also... Write down a Guarantee for 6 six years! No Lawyer would write like that! He seems to be an Uneducated Terminator... What Lawyer? you said 6 months... Though we have given 6 years time... Don't you write down a Guarantee paper? What is Guarantee? - What Lawyer are you? Lawyer means... - Don't talk! Hey... Drink water... It will not work out if we trust in this Mud... Get up I say... - Where? I have a great known Lawyer... He has studied in England... Barret Law! We shall meet them! What has that Lawyer said? He said Lawyers are not required to win the Heart of the Enemies... - How then? Gandhiji's Non-Voilence! - Gandhiji's Non-Violence? The opposite to Rowdism... That Rajalingam thinks that we would fight for the Bungalow... But... we do it in reverse! We would be sending Flowers to him to get recover from the Current disease soon... What? Didn't you understand? If so... Watch the rest of the show over the Screen! Coffee! - Place it there! Good Morning Raj... Your friend! Mother... Juice! - Okay... What Honey? Has your would be sent Red roses for you? Suresh? It's impossible... - Why? Their Astrologer said that the Rose flowers are Unlucky for their family... That's why Uncle has taken all the Rose Flowers from their home! AS their Secretary's name is Roja... they have gone to Court and changed to Pooja! You silliness... If I do such mental deeds... will you bear? Whose desire is theirs... What about you? Haven't you taken photo posing with Ash and Bush? Similarly... Whose belief is theirs! Who has sent the Flowers then? These flowers are for you Raj... - For me? Shankar? No... No... Don't touch... Don't touch! There is a Bomb in that... - Dear! Bomb... Bomb... Hey... all of you lie down! All of you lie on the floor... Something has been written in this! Our Lawyer has said that it's a disease betraying the Humans! As you are ripen in that... your disease has also been matured! That's why I would be sending flowers untill you recover from that disease... Are you confused? Have a look from the Window... Knife... Pistol... Sickle... Axe... Why are the Voilent Weapons? Why are the Voilent Weapons? Not Hastiness... Anger... Hatred... Smile is our Weapon! Smile is our Weapon! He is coming... Tell him! - The days for Injustice have been damaged... For you right from today - The Box will get smashed! Yes... The Box will get smashed! - Shankar! What is this Drama? This is called the Passive of Resistance - Don't you understand? We don't fight with you for the Bungalow... We would be standing infront of your House like this! Untill you come to know your mistake... the Passive of Resistance would be continued! - Your Father! Anyone of us would be standing on this Road for 24 hours like this... We pray to God for your disease of Cheat should be cured soon... Go and bring our Home Keys... Hey Security... - Sir! I don't know what you do... Get them away from here! - Okay sir... Hey... Will you touch my Brother? - Stop... Stop! What has Bapu said? - What has he said? If one hits on a Cheek... he asked us to show another Cheek! Wait... Have you seen? He won't hit... Bapu has not said what to do if the second cheek is hit! He has left for us! That's it... Shankar! you have done wrong Shankar! Though they beat you... you should lift your hand! Only when you do so... the Heart of the enemy gets changed! The hatred gets reduced and the Respect towards us increases! Ask them for Apologizes... Hey... - You get inside... Give me the Keys respectfully... Else... you will get the very position! Why have you hit like that? Say Sorry... You have hit, haven't you Brother? It's mistake buddy... If we say Sorry to him now... Bapu said... his Hatred gets reduced and the Respect increases towards us! Tell him! What Brother? - Bapu seems to spoil our Business... Sorry man... Get up... I have to say Sorry! We were never arrested! First time... we said Sorry! Direct Lock up... Our Reputation has been lost in the Public! What man? If we come inside doing a Murder Will the reputation go high? Lesser than the Less... If we were thrown into the Jail in the Kidnapping case, there would be a bit level! Hey... Do you know Bapu has been put in Jail for he has prepared the Salt? If so... Bapu's reputation had been lost, right? How many times he had entered into the Jail... His respect has also incresed! Because... Bapu is always right? If so... we do good things and come inside doing 10-20 days... If we have done like that... Our statues are also placed before the Assembly... Our figures will be drawn on the Currency Notes... All roads have Shankar's name... In the School books. There would be lessons about our Friendship! The political Leaders will also be giving speech upon us... Look! As long as the Surya and Chandra exists... Shankar and ATM would be there! My Birthday is considered as the Shankar Jayanthi on my birthday! Holiday for Everything on that day... The total Country would Dry that day... Alcohol is Strike that day! Cancel... Cancel! - Everyday is the festival... Move... Move! - Come on! Hey... we will come again! Thank you! Why should you thank me Shankar? We have to thank you as you have gone to Jail for us! It's an Emotional Touching Scene! How is the Jail? Is only one night enough or should I send you life long? Brother! If we were in the Jail for life long... All cities would be put our name! Vijayawada... Gudiwada... Shankarwada! Hyderabad... Nizamabad... ATMbad! Jubilee Hills... Banjara Hills ...Shankar Hills! Chencharlaguda Jail... Cherlapalli Jail... if you stay permanently... Shankar Jail! Will you stay? Don't play with me... I have got the Police power Man power and the Money power! What would you have? - I have got the power of Gandhi! Henceforth... Look at the Radio... my Vascodagama! A Master Hero came to our Country 100 years ago... He was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi! He has taught everyone of us how to be Honest... To tell you frankly... we have forgotten all that now! You feel that Bapuji is with us in this Studio... Tell us whatever problem you have in your life... I will solve it with the Gandhi's Power! As a return... you have to do us a favour! One of friends is suffering from Unhealthiness... He is closer to the death mentally... He is stubborn in not taking the treatment... If you all say... he will definitely accept! Bapu... lt's live! Be ready... Alas! The line has been disconnected! Not disconnected... It has been made to disconnect! Dial that number... - Okay! Why did you disconnect the phone? Hello... Hello! What is your problem? What will you do if I say? First you tell me what the problem is! Let's think later how to solve it... I want 7 Lakhs rupees... - What for? I have put my Father's money in Shares... I believed as my friends said it would get doubled! Everything has been lost! That money was gathered by my father to buy a Home... How to return him that money to him? Very Simple... Reduce the Expenses... Work Hard... Give him back gathering Rupee by Rupee! It's simple... - How? Do overtime... Don't spend more... Save every paise and give him! Is it a solution? How many years will it take to get 7 Lakhs if I do so? What should I do now? First you go and tell the truth to your father! Dare and reveal the truth to your father! Instead of that... It'd be better if I died run over by any Train! Hey... Don't talk madly! Are you trying to be free by dying? Without the knowledge if you are there or not... You are talking now, aren't you? Your father dials to that number repeatedly... And he weeps like anything as he doesn't know if you are dead or alive! You have done wrong... should your Father experience the Punishment? What should I do now? What is your name? - Azad! Look Azad! He is your Father... not your Enemy! I had also done a mistake when I was a child... Having known it was a mistake... I thought of telling the truth to my father! But... I couldn't tell him with some phobia! However... when I wanted to say... He was not there to hear! That pain has still been in my Heart as it is... you don't do mistake like me! Where is he now? In the Room! - What is he doing? I don't know... the Doors are closed! You open the door and go inside... I am telling you, aren't I? Go. Open the door and go inside! Go. Don't fear Azad... Go! Go boldly! What? What have you done again? Tell me... It's your habit doing mistakes, right? What have you done? Why don't you talk? Tell him Azad... Tell me quickly without wasting my time... Is there Radio in the room? Yes it is! Whom are you talking to? - Switch on the Radio! Brother... Greetings! Your Son wants to say one thing to you... The whole Hyderabad is listening to our speech! Tell him Azad! Father... I thought of telling you earlier! But... - No but or put... come to the point first! I lost 7 lakhs rupees in Shares... Don't hit him... If you hit... your Son never says the Truth throughout the life! I never go to the Share Business again... I do whatever work I get... I distribute Newspapers... I take Tuitions! I earn money working hard... I will give back to you! Brother! Do you think how he earns 7 Lakh rupees doing small jobs? It's true... But he decided to die run over by Train as he had fear to reveal this to you! Sir... You have got your Son who is valuable than money! Be happy for that! Your Son never does this type of mistakes again in his life! Our Francis uncle has 3 Taxis. He needs Drivers everyday... If you recommend... he will take me into the Job! If you feel it shy...

When I was 15 years old... I stole some Gold from my brother! - What Bapu? Have you stolen? After that... My conscience had not allowed me to be peace!

I had spent the whole night weeping at my father... That night had been remembered throughout my life! Later... Has your father forgiven you Bapu? It took some time... But... he has forgiven! It's done Bapu... The idea is good! I will also write a letter and give to Jahnavi tomorrow at 6 'O' clock in the morning! You can give now itself, can't you? No Bapu... If she hates me reading my letter... Atleast these memories left in my Heart! Okay... Don't forget! Morning at 6 'O' clock... Shankar! What is this? - Letter... - To whom? I will stand here... you go and lie down! I will be awake the whole night... I will not lie down at all! Are you not mentally feeling well? When the mind is not feeling well... Closing our eyes... If we remember the happy moments of our life... A type of smile blossoms out of the face! ...Said by Grand father! Close your Eyes once... What is seen? Radio... - Radio?

You can tell me, right? Not now... Morning at 6 'O' clock! Shankar! I know what you say... But... I want to see how you say! You would say as if it would be remembered throughout the life, right? Sometimes... there would be much happiness in waiting! I would be waiting when it would be 6 'O' clock... Like the Night that waits for the Moon Shall I wait with 1000 Eyes? Like the Crop that waits for the Rain Drops Shall I wait with the Bundle of Desire? Like the Infant in the Cradle for the Lull song... Like the Village at the Dawn for the Sound of the Cock... I can't wait... Won't you tell me directly? The word that lies in the Heart... Shall I count each minute like One... Two... Three...? Shall I push the time saying Go... Go... Go?

You won't let me stay pleasant... Shall I count each minute like One... Two... Three...? Shall I turn back the Clock saying Three... Two... One? Why is it? What for? This Tension which was not seen before... My Mind will not stop though I lull to any extent... If you ask me to leave... If you stay with me... I don't know what you say when it dawns...

There are thousands of people in this City who were born in that Star... They have been tired serving their Husbands No Husband has passed away! Those are the Superstitious... you don't believe that! I don't believe... But they believe in that! My father has cheated them without telling the Truth... I hate my Father... I hate him! - Don't say so! He is your Father... He does for your Happiness whatever he does... If I utter his name... you will also say so! Here you see Baby... No... Don't say! I have understood who he is... It's a disease for him to do wrong... Give him a chance to correct that... If you bring your Father's name to the Public. ...you will be the Victim who has done wrong! Your Father can't raise his Head high in Public... Listen to me... Your people would be waiting for you... Go Home! I thought my father was the greatest man comparing to all! But... I did not think he would lie with me! He is a Cheat! I won't go there though I die... Hey... Don't you understand what I say? Listen to what I say properly... You also would have said lies when you were child with or without knowledge... As it's so... Has your father scolded you or Hit you or left all of you? Father is the one who understands you the one who shares his Love! If anything goes wrong. He is one who says it's wrong and says Morals! If you feel pain... He is the one who hugs you to his Heart! That's it... But he won't disturb you mentally like this! That is the Father! Go home listening to my words... It becomes a problem if I go there... It becomes a big problem if you don't go there! The honour of your entire Home go away Only your Father has to bear that... In this situation... He needs Comfort! You only can give your Father... Please... When our Heart is under pressure... I know how pain it will be... if our people are not with us! But... I can't get married telling lies!

I thank you for you have attended the marriage without fail... What Lakshmi? Uncle... I want to tell you a matter! What Honey? As my father said... I was not born at night 11:55 PM! In the Morning at 11:55 AM! Then... that Horoscope? - Fake! Why do you tell that matter now? I don't like to get married telling lies... How did you think you would get married if you say Truth?

Will you utter the Indecent word? - Brother! He is the one who has asked the Old men to vacate the House... If so... he should not be left at all! What man? Who has told you it's dangerous if his Daughter and his Son get married? It's Astrology... Astrology says loudly that the Groom has to face the harm if that Girl weds this Guy...
