Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: And I will dwell in the house of the lord for ever. " We were just children when we lost everything... Our parents, our home, our innocence. Once envied by all our neighbors, suddenly, we found ourselves cast off, stranded at a bus depot with $30 in our pockets and no hope in sight. That was when Henny found us. And she brought us to Dr. Sheffield. Or, as Paul would say, she brought us home. He took us in. He adopted us. He sent us to the best schools. But more than that, he made my brother and sister and I feel safe and loved. Paul's in a better place now. We all know that. But we will never forget him. We will never forget our past. Miss Cathy? Miss Cathy? How you holding up, baby? I'm doing okay, Henny. Listen... I just want you to know that I will always be here for you. Dr. Sheffield made sure of that, okay? Thank you. Carrie's having a pretty rough time. Carrie. Will we have to leave again, like when daddy died? No. This is our home. Paul left it for us. We're gonna be just fine. Corrine, the car is here. Be right there. Everyone is waiting for us. You don't want to be late to your own party. Do I look okay? Enchanting. Oh, my God. Charity be damned. I'd rather just stay home. No, no, no. Let it ring. Let it ring. Hello? This is Corrine Winslow. Hello? Mom, hi. It's Cathy. What'd she say? Nothing. She hung up. Ever since Paul died, I can't stop thinking about her. How could a complete stranger love us and she couldn't? There's no point to asking questions like that. Don't you ever think about the past? What good would that do? We all just need to work hard to build a new future for ourselves. It's what Paul would have wanted. And leap. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up! Point your toe. Push it, Richard. This is not a grade-school recital. Perfection is not something you're born with. It takes practice, devotion, pain. The trick is to not look like you're in pain. My son back from New York. Julian dances with the second-best ballet company in the city. I see they've broken a few of your bad habits. Faster, faster! Again! Again. Up! Up! Faster, faster, faster! Use your head! Better. Ouch. Doesn't bother me. Have you tried lamb's wool? No. And if you tape up between the toes, it'll stop the toes rubbing. You want to dance for yourself, not for my mother's approval. Believe me... nothing's good enough to her. Not even perfection. By increased secretion of the growth hormone from the pituitary gland, your hips are curving, your bust is filling out, and your legs are lengthening. Don't worry. This is all a perfectly natural and necessary part of becoming a woman. At this time, the sex, or gonadotropic hormone is secreted in greater quantities. The sex glands and organs develop rapidly. Since these are all internal organs in girls, their rapid development may cause the stomach to protrude. The pubescent girl is usually very self-conscious about this. The patient was admitted this morning with shortness of breath and palpitations. Sounds like congestive heart failure. Leading to pulmonary edema. With no fluid in the lungs? Patient's got a history of anemia. It could be a glucose-6 deficiency. It's nice to know that one of you has cracked open his textbook. Dr. Reeves... I hope you didn't forget about our dinner date. Well, aren't you going to introduce me? - All right. - These are my third-years. This is Jack, Ed, and Christopher. My daughter, Sarah. Hello. You're the Christopher Sheffield my father's always talking about. - Nothing too bad, I hope. - No. Just... well, I just thought you'd look more studious. All right, gentlemen, let's lay off the Martinis this weekend. I'll see you all in surgical on Monday morning. Nice to meet you. Oh. What is it this time? I was in the middle of a luncheon. Don't trust her. I'm sorry to bother you, but your mother's extremely agitated this morning. Nothing I do will calm her. She... she... poisoned them. Mother, you've had a stroke. Now, you need to stop bothering the nurse with this made-up nonsense. After a stroke, it's quite common for a patient to suffer memory loss, even hallucinations. Miss Olivia... - She... - ... Would you like to try having some lunch? poisoned her children. She poisoned them. Why don't you take the rest of the day off? I can see to my mother. Oh. Well, I believe that would do her a world of good. Good afternoon, Miss Olivia. No, no. Don't go. Ohh. Seems that your brain has finally turned to mush. You can't feed yourself. You can't dress yourself. You really require round-the-clock care. Now, if you're willing to go to a nursing home... No, no, no. This... this... is my house. My... my house. Your house is falling down around you. It's hard to believe that this was once one of the most impressive homes in all of Virginia. It was so grand, so imposing. You're gonna go to hell. You're going to go to hell. So you've told me... many times. But I don't have to listen to it anymore. Have a good day, mother. You've never had moonshine. Isn't it illegal? That's what makes it taste so good. What's your story? I see who you are on the outside... little miss perfect, live in fear of making a mistake, come in early, stay late, never get in anyone's business. Maybe I just don't like chit-chat. - I should go. - Hey, hey, hey. You think that I'm criticizing you? Aren't you? When you dance, it's like you're... you're dying to cut loose, but then just before you do, you chicken out. You don't know anything abut me. I know that you're ambitious... passionate. And I'm willing to bet you've got bigger dreams than just dancing in some rinky-dink company before trading in your tutu for a white picket fence and a bunch of squalling kids. No. You've got something to prove. You won't be happy until the whole world is applauding you and throwing flowers at your feet. You sure it's me you're talking about? Maybe that's why I know you. Because we're the same. Come to New York with me. No, I'm serious. Our company is the best company in New York, despite what my mother says. George, the director he's in love with me. If I tell him to give you a place in corps de ballet, he will. How far you go after that is up to you. I wouldn't even have to audition? You already had your audition. You passed. I had a really good time... think about my offer. Where were you? Nowhere. I went out for a bite after class. Till 2:00 A.M.? Get out of my room. You don't need to give yourself to the first guy that looks your way. You're worth more than that. I didn't give myself to anybody. We were just talking. Is that what you call it? So you're spying on me now? Do you have any idea how worried I was about you? I'm sorry. I should have called. I'm not a child anymore. I know you're not a child. I've known that for a long time. I am trying to move on and start a life apart from you. I'm sorry. I can't stop thinking about you. What happened in the attic and... how it felt to touch you. I know. Do you ever think of me in that way? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. I wish we could be like this forever. What's the matter? What is it? I can't stay here. What do you mean? I'm going to New York with Julian. What? If I stay here, I'm only holding you back from the life that you deserve, from a wife and from children. I want to be with you. God already punished us once. Cathy, lots of women have miscarriages. If that baby had been born... We can't do this. We can't become our parents. You're just gonna run off with some guy you don't know to a strange city? Julian believes in me. He believes that I could be someone. You are someone... to me. You are the only person who's ever really known me, and you are the only person I will ever truly love. No. Don't say that. You'll love someone else. You have to. All right, babe, let's go. I'll call you every week. Take care. I'm gonna be a big star. I'll make you proud. I'm proud of you just the way that you are. You ready to go? We are starting our new season with an all-new take on "Romeo and Juliet. " Romeo will be played by Julian Marquet, and as for Juliet, I am searching for a fresh face and a fresh take. I am not looking for a sweet, blushing waif who passively succumbs to the attentions of a stranger. I am looking for a fierce, passionate woman who sees Romeo and knows instantly she wants him in her bed. Their love is forbidden. It's exhilarating yet ultimately destructive. And they sacrifice everything... family, country, friends, and, ultimately, their lives. This is where you live? Bathroom's down the hall. Where do you sleep? Oh. Okay. What's the matter? Not what you expected? I guess not. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You Southern girls like to act all shy and demure. But now it's just you and me. Now you're mine. Your collarbone. Your neck. Your belly. All this is mine. I need to hear you say it. Tell me you're mine. I'm yours. Nurse Clark to maternity. Nurse Clark to maternity. I like looking at the little babies, too. Oh, they're so sweet and innocent. Hard to believe they'll all grow up someday. Not all of them. Well, how are you doing today? Good. Thank you. Well, I'm sure the gift shop's wondering where I've wandered off to. Uh, wait. Um... I was actually, uh... I was gonna come looking for you. Would you want to go on a date with me, uh, next Saturday? You want to go out with me? On Valentine's Day? Oh. I'm... I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't realize. You must... you must already have plans. No, no. I... I'd love to go out with you... on Valentine's Day. Okay. Um... Okay, great. You just made my day. We we shall only know the blessing of our father's sweet caressing when they ring the golden bells for you and me Good morning, girls. Good morning, Miss Calhoun. In this morning's announcements, the madrigal society will meet in the south courtyard. Sign up with Miss Pritchett for bridge club. And senior girls are required to attend etiquette and dance instruction for this spring's cotillion. Now, I know you think you don't need any instruction. I'm wearing my mama's best pearl choker and silk gloves. Well, my gown is made from the finest battenburg lace, just like my mama wore to her debut. What are you gonna wear to the cotillion, Carrie? I don't know. Shh. Well, I'm sure you'll look like a real doll. So, that being said, you all have to... in fact, you can just borrow this one's outfit. It's cute. Give it back. It's mine. Seriously, Carrie, why haven't you grown? Isn't your mama worried? Mm. Or is she a freak, too? Don't talk about my mother! Miss Sheffield. - She attacked me. - Miss St. Morgan, if you please. I will see you both in my office after morning assembly. Oh. Sorry. Wait. Don't go. Do you think I'm pretty? Carrie... Please. I just want to know the truth. Of course. I think you're very pretty. But not the way you think Cathy is. What do you mean? I... I just know you like her best. I love both of my sisters the same. Here we go. Present the chest. Open the back. Stop. The pas de deux in "Romeo and Juliet" is two dancers who become one. You cannot climb down from his lift. You need to melt into it. Uh, Cathy, step in. There you go. Are you screwing him? Unh! Yolanda, please step in. Why don't you see if you can manage to stay in Romeo's arms. Ready? How's the knee? You dropped me. Well, maybe next time, you'll try focusing instead of flirting. I wasn't flirting. What are you talking a... I'm Romeo. I am. You're a nothing. You're a nobody. And without me, you wouldn't have anything. You sure as hell wouldn't have a place in this ballet company. I made that happen for you. And don't you forget it. I'm sorry. Aah! All the other girls in the company want to be with me. Why can't you love me? Carrie's been a little jittery about the cotillion. All the other girls have their fathers to present them, their mothers to teach them how to curtsy, and all poor Carrie has is me. Well, I'd say she's pretty lucky. My mother died the year before my cotillion. My poor daddy almost didn't survive. Exactly one hour before my cotillion, my grandmother's antique slip just disintegrated in my hands. So my poor widowed dad had to make a dash to the intimates store. I swear... I'd never seen my daddy's face so red. And not just 'cause he was running. Does she have a dress yet? I... I don't... I don't actually know. I... I think Henny may be helping her with that. I'm not sure. Well, if she needs anyone to take her shopping, I'd be happy to help. That would be great. I... I know she would love that. Well, this is me. I had a really nice time today. It's okay. You can kiss me. I'd like to see you again. I'd really like that. Okay. Um... I'll call you. Okay. Okay. Um... Good night. Good night. Is it up? Congrats, Yolanda. I'm so happy for you. Congratulations. Better luck next time, bonita. Principals and soloists I want to see in the rehearsal hall in five minutes. Long rehearsal? Get me an aspirin, will you? I've got a screaming headache. Did you take Yolanda out for some moonshine? Last thing I need right now is flak from you. Give me the damn aspirin. I'm going home. My brother's graduating from medical school tomorrow, and I want to be there. Are you kidding me? Why would I stay? I'm... I'm background. Nobody's gonna miss me. What is it with your brother, anyway? Hmm? He just... snaps his fingers, and you come running? Is that how it works? No. No. He doesn't have anybody else. It's just me and Carrie. Yeah, well, who do I have, huh? Who do I have?! You should want to be here for me. Julian, please. Aah! You're not leaving me. Hmm? If I say I want you dancing in the background, you damn well better do it! Do you understand?! Unh! Aah! You belong to me, Cathy, whether you know it or not. If any man gets between us, even your brother... I'll kill him. And I'll kill you, too. Smile. Perfect. Well, I guess we should go in and find our seats. Cathy's here. I'm not late? I told the cab driver it was a medical emergency. I've missed you. I missed you, too. Dr. Sheffield, I presume. You came. I wouldn't miss your graduation... rehearsal or no rehearsal. Hi. You must be Cathy. Uh, I'm sorry. Cathy, this is, uh, Sarah Reeves. I'm Christopher's girlfriend. I'm so excited to finally meet you. I feel like I already know you, 'cause you're pretty much all Christopher ever talks about... what a wonderful ballerina you are and how close you've always been. It's lovely to meet you. Well, I can't wait to hear all about New York and what it's like to be a real, live ballerina. Your life is pretty much every little girl's dream. I'm sorry. I'm sure the two of you'd like to catch up. Cathy, we'll save you a seat inside. I'm sorry I never told you. It just never seemed like the right time. She seems lovely. - Are you okay? You seem... - I'm fine. What happened to your eye? I'm stupid. I was at a rehearsal, and I wasn't watching where I was going. I walked straight into a wall. Cathy, if something were wrong, you would tell me, right? Christopher, stop it. This is your special day, and I am perfectly fine. Like your girlfriend said, I'm living every little girl's dream. I didn't think you'd come back. Neither did I. For what it's worth, I'm sorry. I... I'm a bastard when I drink. I'll do anything you want, baby. Just forgive me, please. Just... just tell me what you want, and I'll do it. Cathy, look at me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it. You need to keep this area clear for the principals. I don't want to be tripping over your crap. Come on. Let's go. Hmm? My foot! The nurse just phoned. Your mother's refusing to take a bath. She can just stew in her own juices. I'm sorry. Did I sound too cruel? No. I'm pretty sure your mother owns the patent on that. What's all this? I hired an architect to renovate Foxworth Hall. Without telling me? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to exclude you. I just didn't expect you to run your firm and oversee a full-scale renovation. When you say "full-scale"... I want to gut it completely. I want to drive out the darkness and bring in the light. Don't tell me that means your mother's gonna finally go to a nursing home. Of course not. But I'm done living under her thumb. If she won't move out, then I'll just work around her. Please say you're okay with my little plan. Please say you're okay with it. I just don't want you taking on too much right now. But I'm better. I'm better. I'm so much better than I was before. You've been so good and so patient and kind. This isn't just for me. It's... it's a new start for both of us. Okay. Ladies always leave and enter a room without being heard, so excellent time to practice now. Oh, no. It can't be gone. What's wrong? Nothing. Is it your doll? She is really beautiful. My mother gave it to me. It's the only thing I have from her. Don't tell Lacey I told you, but... I heard her telling Sissy Towers to steal your doll and hide it in the third-floor storage closet. Thanks. What do we have here? Aren't you a little old to play with dolls? You weren't trying to help me at all. Why would I want to help a freak? Why don't you do us a favor and put your head in that noose. You better leave me alone, or I'm gonna tell Miss Calhoun. You'd better just keep your mouth shut. Come on, Ashley. You heard her. The freak wants to be alone. No! Maybe if you're lucky, they'll find you in time for graduation. Open the door! Open it! Eyes on her the whole time, Julian. Lift in arabesque. Slide your balance. Lovely. And let the feeling carry you. And drape yourself over him. Beautiful. Beautiful. - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here? I was hoping I could stay with you for a while. Don't you have finals? I just really missed you. Is it those girls at school? Are they being mean to you? No. It's just Christopher's so busy now, and he's got Sarah. I thought I could just finish school in New York. - Cathy, we're rehearsing act 2. - Julian... You remember my sister, Carrie. It's a little early for opening night. Actually, she was hoping that she could stay with us for a while. I won't be any trouble, I promise. I can cook and clean. I can help out around the house. If it makes Cathy happy, then it's fine with me. You know, the original woodwork on the staircase is all hand-carved and really a work of art. It could be stripped and refinished, which would be considerably less expensive. Well, I don't care about the expense. I want it removed. When you walk in, I want it to feel like it's an entirely different house. Well, okay. It's your money. Yes, it is. Well, I guess the only other thing that we have left to talk about is the, uh, guest room and the attic. I've made some renderings. Well, I told you no one's to go in there. Oh, I just figured since you were doing everything else... it's... it's a massive amount of space. No, I want it to disappear. I want you to remove the door, and I want you to plaster over it. Well, there's some furniture and some things up there, some children's things. I told you to get rid of it! If you want this job, you'll do as I say, or I'll find someone else who will. Okay. I'm hopeless. You need to use a lighter touch. A good crust suffers from too much kneading. Well, I hope I get the hang of it by next Saturday. Susan and Jim invited us over for a barbecue, and I promised to bring the pie. - I'll be in New York. - What? Cathy has her debut in "Romeo and Juliet. " Oh. You didn't tell me. I just wanted to be there for her. Of course you should go. You know, I think it's really sweet how much you love your sister. She'll be off stage in just a minute. Thanks. What the hell are you doing? Hi. Um, when did you get in? I asked you a question. Your sister just wanted me to show her a little ballet. With your hand up her skirt? You're here. That was the best it's ever gone... What the hell is going on? What are you talking about? I walk in, and your boyfriend's got his hands all over Carrie. That's not true. Nothing happened. - Why are you doing this? - Why am... talk to him! - He wasn't doing anything. - I saw you! I think your brother just needs to get laid. Don't you ever touch my sister again, do you hear me?! Stop it! Stop it! No! No! - What... - Oh, my God. Are you all right? - Julian! - Cathy! Julian! Did something happen between you and Carrie? Just tell me. You accuse me? Well, you're the twisted one. You know, I could never figure out why you couldn't love me. But it's because of him, isn't it? What do you mean? Are you in love with him? Are you with him?! You're such a bastard. I'm the bastard, am I? Then why are you still here? Because up until this moment, I thought that our child should know his father. And close. - And tendu. And close. And everybody turning around to the other side, please. Nice, long arms. Nice and tall, please. Long. Tuck the tailbones. And finish. Beautiful. Curtsy at the bar, please. Thank you so much. I'll see you next week. You did a great job, girls. I'll see you all next week, okay? - Thank you. - Thank you. Remember to stretch. Corrine. I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else. That's been happening to me since the accident. That's all right. I'm sure it's not easy losing your boyfriend like that. I heard it was a miracle you even survived. I guess I'm just lucky. At least you have your beautiful son. Jory. I bet he'll be a wonderful dancer, just like his father was. Nice class today, Ruby. - Thank you. - Thank you. See you soon. All things bright and beautiful all creatures great and small all things wise and wonderful the lord God made them all each little flower that opens each little bird that sings he made their glowing colors he made their tiny wings Can I get you a doughnut? They're homemade. I haven't got much of a sweet tooth. Well, I suppose that's because you're sweet enough as is. I don't know about that. Well, your voice certainly is. But I'm sure all the boys back in high school told you that. No. Not really. Listen, there is a, uh, new play at the playhouse this weekend, if you're interested. We could have dinner afterwards. You want to go on a date with me? I'm... I'm so sorry. I... I should have figured that you have a boyfriend. Oh, no, I don't. That's not it. I'd love to go. That's great. Cath? You home? In here. Cathy had an evening class, so I'm watching Jory. That's awfully nice of you. Oh, I wanted to. Oh, he's my sweet boy. Aren't you? I think he has Carrie's eyes, don't you? More like Corey's. Who's Corey? Carrie's twin. He died when he was 6. Christopher, I'm so sorry. Oh, you... you never mentioned him. I'm sorry. I should have told you earlier. I'm glad you told me. I don't want us to have secrets anymore. Between the choir bake sales and the collection plate, we have raised almost enough money to go to the choral festival this spring. Down in Macon? Uh, which hymn would we do? Well, I enjoy "Praise his name," but I was thinking of trying "Children, go where I send thee. " Unless you don't like that one. Oh, no. That's one of my favorites. It's just... my stepfather used to sing it to me whenever I had bad dreams. It's hard to imagine you having any bad thoughts. You know, most girls your age are only interested in the latest hairstyle or movie magazine, but you're different, more innocent and pure. I just like singing. That's all. I bet you think I'm a pretty big square talking about choir music. No. Really, I... I like it. Carrie, you... you're like a beautiful, precious doll. Alex. I know it's only been a few months, but I know deep in my heart that you are good. I may not be the richest or best-looking or most exciting man in the world, but I would be the proudest if I had you by my side. Will you marry me? We can have the wedding right here in the backyard while the wisteria's in bloom. Oh, actually, I haven't told him yes. I said I needed time to think. What... what is there to think about? Alex is perfect. He's kind and he's generous and he obviously thinks you hung the moon. What if I'm not good enough for him? How can you say that, Carrie? Christopher was right about Julian. He did touch me. I'm so sorry I didn't protect you. It wasn't just him. I liked it. I knew it was wrong, but I wanted it to happen. I liked the way that he looked at me and how he made me feel. How could I be a minister's wife, Cathy? Maybe I really am the devil's spawn, just like our grandmother said. That's not true. What if it is? I'm not 6 anymore. I know that mom and dad weren't supposed to be together, that what they did was bad. Maybe that's why I'm so small... not from the attic, but from what our parents did. We are not the sins of our parents. The best thing that you can do is move on and forget mom, forget the attic. Just marry Alex and never look back. Judith tells me that you're overseeing the entire renovation of Foxworth Hall yourself. Well, if you want to do it right, you have to stay on your toes and on your contractors. Too true. Can I have another one, please? Hi, mama. All my letters got returned, so I wanted to give this to you in person. I'm getting married, mama. It would mean the world to me if you would be there... at my wedding. You must be mistaking me with someone else. I don't have a daughter. Morning, Henny. - Morning, Miss Cathy. - How are you? Miss Carrie got herself up early and done some baking. Have you seen Carrie? I think she's upstairs. Why? What's wrong? Oh, my God. Oh, no. No. No, no, no. Oh, Carrie. I am not just gonna sit here and watch the people who I love the most in my life die and do nothing, say nothing. There's nothing that you can say that will bring Carrie back. Our mother murdered our brother in the attic, and now she has murdered our sister as clearly as if she poured the poison down her throat. Look at this. Carrie went to see her the day before she died. She's been writing her all of these years, begging her to come to her birthday party, her wedding. She wrote her saying that the kids at school call her a freak and she thinks she really is the devil's spawn. She was begging our mother for some sign that she wasn't completely unloved. And Corrine didn't just turn her back, she spat in her face. But nothing you can say is going to change a thing. She doesn't love us. I don't care. I don't want her love. I want her to hurt the way that she hurt us. - Cathy. - Still protecting her. I am not protecting her. I am trying to protect you. Well, you can't! If you go through with this, you are alone. I want no part of it. You are a part of this whether you want to be or not. Julian was right. We are all twisted. And the devil didn't make us that way, she did. And now she's gonna pay. Right this way. Miss Sheffield, Bart Winslow. - Pleasure to meet you. - Cathy. The pleasure's all mine. I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long. Just dealing with my mother-in-law. Another one of her nurses quit. Oh. I hope she's not too sick. Oh, no. I... I'm sure she'll outlive us all. Running my wife in circles seems to keep her going. Is that your wife? She's pretty. You must have beautiful children. Uh, my wife couldn't have any. I'm sorry. Do you have children? I do... a son, Jory. - How fun. - So much fun. I can't imagine my life without him. Sorry. That was thoughtless. No. It's... it's fine. I'm crazy about children. It's... one of the biggest regrets of my life, actually. But you didn't come here to discuss my personal tragedies, so... Tell me. How can I help you? I was hoping you could help me revise my family's trust. Okay. My guardian passed away and left my siblings and me quite a bit of money, but my sister recently passed away. She was murdered, actually. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Thank you. So, now it's just my brother and me. Oh. You're not married. I... I just assumed. My husband died in a car accident when I was pregnant with our son. Sounds like you've been through your own fair share of tragedy. My mother always said, "if you cling to the past, you'll drown in a sea of tears. " Well, she sounds like a very wise woman. Let's just say that everything I know about pain I learned from her. Christopher, being a doctor is a tremendous privilege. People treat you like a God. But with that comes a great deal of pressure. Now, I know that you've gone through some very tough times recently. And I've often said that what gets us through those tough times is the love of our family. You've been dating my daughter for over a year now. Sarah is a very sweet girl, Christopher. She's always been the light of my life. If you're serious about her, I would like nothing more than to welcome you into our family as a son. But if you don't intend to marry my daughter, you need to let her go. Right on time. Oh. I wasn't expecting you. Is Christopher with you? He doesn't know I came up here to Virginia. Can I come in? Of course. Sorry. I'm just surprised you're here. I know this isn't my place, but I was hoping the two of you could patch things up, whatever happened between you. I just know that Christopher misses you very much. I've just been busy. Cathy, I know that's not true. The fact is, you're the most important person in the world to him. And I know that Christopher would just be heartbroken if you weren't part of our wedding. What? We're getting married at the end of the year. And I was hoping that you'd be my maid of honor. Of course. Oh. Your wife won't miss you tonight? No. She's busy renovating the entrance to her family's mansion for about the 17th time now. Sounds like a huge project. It's hell, but it makes my wife happy. You must love her very much. Let's just say she keeps things lively. Never a dull moment with Corrine. Must be glamorous... fancy parties, exotic vacations. Want to know the truth? Sometimes, I fantasize about living in a tiny, little cottage somewhere in suburbia. Picket fence, hamburgers on the grill, playing catch in the yard. That's so funny, because the people that have that life are probably fantasizing about trading places with you. The grass is always greener. I suppose it's hard to get through life without a few little regrets. Anything you say yes to... you're necessarily saying no to something else. I hate the word "no. " I much prefer... the sound of "yes. " Yes. Yes! Yes! I asked the contractor for Robin's-egg blue, and he brought over cornflower and periwinkle. The man is colorblind. It's not Robin's egg. Well... This one matches your eyes. Do you want to come with me to the house today? I'm meeting the contractor over there later. These men think they can ride roughshod over me. I'm sorry, babe. I got to go to work. It's a Sunday. Uh, yeah. We're trying to hash out a settlement on this Josephson case, so... Okay. I'll probably be home late. Will you wake me? I love you. I love you, too. Are you okay? Yeah. I just haven't been feeling very well lately. It's just it's my first Christmas without my sister and... my brother's getting married and I'm even jealous that I'm not invited to your Christmas party. I don't want to hurt you. The fact is I'm happier with you than I've been in a long, long time. I've known all along that you love your wife. I do love my wife. But I'm also falling head over heels for you. Doctor's office. Hi. It's Cathy Sheffield. Dr. Weiss said I should call this morning for my test results. Please hold. I just talked to the florist. He can't get the white peonies for my bouquet. Oh, honey. If you carried a bunch of dandelions, you'd still be the prettiest girl in the room. You're the best daddy in the whole wide world. Except for the fact that you won't give your son-in-law time off for his honeymoon. Well, I was planning to surprise you with this later tonight, but, uh... I've booked you two a week in Bermuda. Oh, daddy! You leave tomorrow night after the reception. Dr. Reeves, this is... Oh, call me dad. No. Come here. Dad. Thank you. You're welcome. You know, I'm just glad that my daughter finally made an honest man out of you. Hi. Jory's here! Hi! I think your ring bearer needs a diaper change. Oh. Hi. That's my boy. I missed you. You're so sweet. - Cathy. - Hi. Dr. Reeves. Since when do you drink whiskey? You don't know everything about me. It's late. Don't you think you should get some sleep? I'm not tired. What time do you have to be at the church in the morning? 9:00. Sarah obviously adores you, and she's gonna be a wonderful wife and mother. Everything that you just said is true, and yet there's one problem. She isn't you. You can have a good life, Christopher. All my life, all I've ever wanted is you. I love you with all my heart, but we can't be together again. Please marry Sarah and just be happy. Don't look at me. I'm sorry. I just forgot... I don't care what folks are saying. God will forgive you. Thank you, Henny. You could practice at a hospital out of s... It's over, Cathy. Don't you get it? I'm finished. We both are. Don't say that. Come to California with me. You, me, and Jory can start over, start a new life. People don't know us out there. I don't want to live a lie. It's not a lie. I love you, and I always have. I can't hurt anyone else. I can't. He's not gonna leave her, Cathy. She has all the money. Believe or not, some people don't put money before their own children. What are you talking about? I'm pregnant with Bart's child. Do you love him? No. I love you. But I have to finish what I started. You're not going alone. Christopher... I'm coming with you. Whatever you do, don't make your grandmother angry, okay? Beautiful, prideful, and weak, just like your mother. God sees what you do behind my back. God sees everything. Martha, is that you? Martha, I need you! I'm not Martha. I know who you are. What took you so long? All these years, I had nightmares about you. Will you get my nurse for me? You're just a pathetic old hag. You can't hurt me anymore. You've always had a nasty mouth. The whole time we were in the attic, you talked about God and the Bible. Well, your mother spoiled you. I was doing God's work. God doesn't starve children. He doesn't beat them. That was you. You did that to us. And you made two years of our lives a living hell. Two years? Try 60 years... in this God-forsaken house. - I'm the prisoner here! - My brother died because of you. Well, he was filth. He should never have been born. He was a little boy, and he did not deserve that. And now Carrie's dead because of the lies that you hammered into our heads. You said we were wicked. And we were innocent. Innocent? You think I don't know what went on in that attic? You spread your legs for your own brother. Don't you dare say another word. Oh, you're gonna kill me? Do it! Do me a favor! But even if you do, you'll still have the Foxworth blood flowing through your veins. You'll always be what you are... the devil's spawn. Aah! I am not my mother, and I am not you! You can leave Foxworth Hall, but you can never escape this family. You sure you want to go through with this? She walled off the attic, Christopher. She made it look all shiny and pretty, like we were never there, like it never happened. She can't get away with this. Not this time. I brought you a dress for the party tonight. I'm not going. You might as well enjoy yourself, because I've made arrangements to check you in to a nursing home tomorrow. You can't make me go. I won't let you. I am through taking orders from you. I make the rules in this house now. You couldn't survive without me. You don't know what I could do. Oh, yes, I do. I know exactly what you can do. Nobody's interested in the rantings of an old woman. I'm gonna take my rightful place in this house tonight, and you'll be there to watch. Ready for your big night? Almost. Who was that on the phone earlier? Uh, just a nervous client. Needed a little hand-holding. I know I've been neglecting you recently. I put this renovation ahead of everything, including you. It's okay. No, it's not okay. From now on, I intend to give you my undivided attention. Ahh, yes. Does this feel good? Yeah. I know you've been seeing someone else. I don't want to know who it is. I don't want to know anything about her. I just want you to end it. After tonight, we'll put all our sins in the past and we'll never speak of this ever again. I went through three contractors before I found one who could finish the job. Well, it looks even more spectacular... and I'm not talking about the house. You're so kind. It's true, darling. You look especially radiant tonight. Well, I'd say dragging this house out of the dark ages has done wonders for my disposition. Mother. If you'll excuse me, it's almost time for the toast. It was in this house at this very party 12 years ago when I first fell in love with Corrine. Aww! I was a baby plucked from my cradle. Funny. I thought it was a swan bed. Bart, my mother is here. So, tonight, in this season of miracles, I want to raise a glass to Foxworth Hall reborn and to my dazzling wife, Corrine, who always keeps things exciting and new. To Corrine. To Corrine. Aww. I would also like to raise a toast to Corrine. I was also at the Foxworth Christmas party 12 years ago. See, my brothers and sister and I lived in the attic, locked up by our grandmother... kept hidden away like a dirty little secret by your dazzling hostess, our mother. I see that you're shocked to learn Corrine actually has children. - She's lying. - Had children, in the case of my two younger siblings. She poisoned Corey. Why are you even listening to her? Mother, tell them it's not true. Oh, Corrine, dear, I don't think anyone is interested in the rantings of an old woman. This is insane. Bart, get these people out of the house. - She's your daughter? - No. Don't lie to me. Tell him, Corrine, or I will. I wanted to help them. No, you were trying to kill them. Shut up! I needed an excuse to get them out. Oh, my God. You know my father. He was so hard on me. He never would have accepted me. He would have written me out of his will. Don't look at me that way. I'm your wife. She's nothing to you. That's not true, either. I'm pregnant with his child. What? Merry Christmas, mother. You are just as crazy as that witch of a mother of yours. You point the finger at me, but you slept with her. You slept with my daughter and then you came home and pretended to love me! All of you, out. I want everyone out of this house! I want everyone out! She's always hated me. It's the devil's spawn. Tell her to get rid of it. - What? - You have to. I can't even look at you right now. You need to give me time to think. I'd like a moment alone with Cathy. It's okay. For what it's worth, I'm sorry. For what? Lying to me? Seducing me to get even with your mother? I did what I did for reasons you couldn't possibly understand. No, I understand. You wanted to hurt my wife. I did, but I didn't realize... No. No, you didn't realize. I know that you don't believe it, but I do care about you. This isn't just our lives anymore. Get out. So, the chickens have come home to roost, huh? This is your fault, all of it. "Those who sow the seeds of evil shall reap the harvest in hell. " You made me put them in the attic. You said that it was the only way. They're an abomination in the eyes of the lord. They were my children. Everything that I ever loved you took from me. They never should have been born, you stupid, sinful girl. Why couldn't you love me? I love you. I... I even have a present for you. It's in the trunk. A little surprise. Open it. What did you do? I had your workmen go up to the attic and bring down some of your precious souvenirs. My poor baby. Mother? It's gonna be okay. Don't listen to what the others are saying. We can start over. We can go north to Pennsylvania. No one will know us there. What are you talking about? It kicked. If it's a boy, we'll name him Christopher, after you. Don't look at me. We could start a family, just like we always dreamed. What are you doing?! Don't you love me? We need to hide the body in the attic. No one will find him there. Corey. He's in a better place now, but we must never speak of it again. You didn't even bury him. I'm sorry, Corey. I'm so sorry. What... Are you crazy? What are you doing? Goodbye, mother. No. No! Help! Cathy, get out! There's a fire! What? Bart, no. Help! I'm not gonna just let her burn. What have I done? Cathy! Come on. We got to go. We got to go. Don't even get me started on my in-laws. I hate to break up the party, but dessert's ready. It looks delicious. I made your dad's favorite homemade apple pie. Looks wonderful, honey. Sure does, mom. What's your secret, anyway? You Dollangangers are always so perfect. Well, who's hungry? Me! Me! I'm nothing... I'm nothing like my mother. I'm nothing like her at all. I'm gonna stand up to my mother and tell her that I'm getting them out. And I don't care what she says and I don't care what my father says. And they're locked in the room, and I just need the key. I just need the key. Why won't you let me see them?! Mother! I need to see my babies! My babies need me! I need to see my babies! I'm nothing like my mother. I'll show them I'm nothing like my mother. I'm nothing like my mother. I need to see my babies. I love my babies.
