What's happening here? Get off! (ELEPHANT TRUMPETING) Move them! Move, move, move! Come on. Move them! Let's go! KONRADIN: Cernik! Cernik! The tractor's off the road. It's in the ditch. Get off the road. My name's Karel Cernik. I'm the manager of this circus. I have a permit to travel. Get your wagons in the ditch. Do as you're told. That's it. (INDISTINCT) Get it off the road. Change your expression. Smile. Or they'll know what you're thinking. Mr. Cernik. Look at that. Rear axle on that trailer's broken. KONRADIN: Guys, come on. Again? Vosdek. Vosdek! Joe, my father wants you. Be right with you, sir. Here. I'll finish. No. It's finished. Check it, will you, please? Check your knots. (LAUGHS) The rear axle on my trailer. Again? Again. Call all the men in the circus by their first names? If I know them well enough. Yes. Why? I don't like it. You're my daughter, Tereza. I work in this circus, too. I earn what I'm paid. I'll do as I please. You are my daughter. That young man is a stranger to us. He's been with the circus for nearly a year. He's still a stranger. Do you know anything about him? Where he came from? Who are his people? I know that I like him, I like to be with him, and I will be with him just as much as I want. You will have nothing to do with Vosdek outside of your work. (HORSE NEIGHING) What's that bandage on Maria? It's nothing. When we stopped suddenly, she got kicked. She'll be all right. I wish we could take better care of you, baby. MAN: Coming through. (ALL SHOUTING) Rotten. Rotten. If that had happened in a performance, somebody would have broken his neck. Everything's rotten. You're right. Everything's falling apart. Father, I'm sorry that I flared up. But you don't need to be worried about Joe. He's a good man. He's decent. He's clean and... I'm not worrying about him. About you, my darling. Isn't your fault that you're as ignorant as a child. You haven't anyone to teach you. No mother, no school, except the circus. No one but me. I've had no time. Come on. Come on. We didn't stop here just to smoke. Get moving! Come on, Max! Get up! We have a performance in Volary tomorrow. We entertain the people. Get this circus back on the road. Come on, Max. Get moving! Get this circus on the road! Hurry up back there! (BAND PLAYING SOMBER MUSIC) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (BAND PLAYING LIVELY MUSIC) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Hurry. Hurry. (INDISTINCT) (SHUSHING) (AUDIENCE SCREAM) Jaromir. Police are in the house. What? Police. Private or secret? Secret. Where? You sure? Yes. Come on. (ALL SCREAM) I really frightened them that time, didn't I? The police are here. Police? Where? (BAND STOPS) (BAND RESUMES PLAYING) Enough! (JAZZ SONG PLAYING ON RADIO) (MUSIC STOPS) Wait! What are you doing? (SHUSHING) Police are here. (WHISPERING) Since when is it a crime to listen to music? If you don't mind my asking, what are you trying to do with that chalk? Everybody around here complains because I don't work with the circus. They say I'm just a piece of excess baggage. So, I'm working up an act. Oh, I see. (CLICKS TONGUE) (LAUGHS) A man in Carlsbad once told me I had the most beautiful toes in the world. Yeah, I know. I was that man in Carlsbad. We didn't have so many other things to worry about in those days. Yeah. Good-bye. Be careful. What are you doing there? The canvas is rotten! I didn't pull hard! Don't you ever talk to Mr. Cernik that way! Who's that? New man? He's the best I could get. He's stupid. All of our canvas is going. Where's Placek? He's supposed to be watching that. He's gone. Where? Guess they found out he was a good man. They transferred him to work in a factory in Klatovy. I see. Maybe you'll be the next one they take. (SHOUTING) Come on with those poles! I hope not, Mr. Cernik. My whole life is in this circus. Yeah. I know that. We couldn't get along without you. Took you long enough to get here. Come on with my beer! Come on! Mother Cernik, excuse me. What did the police want? I don't know. They didn't talk to anyone. They came and they looked at us. Then they went... (WHISTLES) Without a word. They suspect something. I wouldn't worry if they'd asked a question or two. This silence... MAN: Everybody outside. Move! It's coming down. Yeah. (SHOUTING) Ready! ALL: Ho! Pull! You love your flowers, don't you, Mrs. Cernik? Oh, yes. They're beautiful. I love to work in my garden. It's good coffee. I don't make it. My husband's the cook. (CAR HORN HONKING) Oh! What's that? Police. Oh! (SHOUTING) Move those poles! They're not gonna move themselves! Let's go! Come on, you people! Are you the manager of this circus? No, sir. He's over by the horse tent. KONRADIN: Baby, come on. Dance. Get out. One, two. Dance. Tereza, make him lift his left foot. TEREZA: Come on. You are Karel Cernik? Yes. You are to come with me. I'm arrested? You will be taken to SNB Headquarters in Plzen for questioning. What time is it? Will I be able to return in time for the performance this evening? Perhaps. If your answers are satisfactory. May I be permitted to put my coat on and necktie? Do it quickly. Excuse me. What's the trouble now? I don't know. They're taking me to Plzen. Have they accused you of anything? They didn't tell me. Did it ever occur to you to stand up for your rights? (SCOFFS) I haven't any rights. Nobody has. When will you be back? They won't keep me long. It's only the usual routine. You know, one of these days, you may walk in here and find I've packed my suitcase and left. You think I couldn't get along on my own, don't you? What? I didn't say anything. You look very nice. (MUTTERING) Nice. Don't lie to me. No, no. If I don't get back in time for the performance, you know what to do. I know, Karel. Just keep an eye on everything, will you? Watch her. You think she cares? The minute he's out of sight, she'll head for the lions' cage. What do you expect? She's not of the circus. (MUTTERING) I love you more than you'll ever know. (MUTTERING) Always practicing your tricks, aren't you? It's a pity you can't learn to do something. I know a few tricks, too. No, women are not like angels. Don't place them so high above. Remember, no matter what I do, my heart belongs to you. (WHIP CRACKS) Now, come, come, Pasha. You're showing no life. We must have life in the act. Yes. We must have zest. Otherwise, the people go to sleep. They want you to frighten them. Understand? Oh, I know, poor fellow. It isn't easy to show life when all we can feed you is slops. Mash made of sawdust for the king of beasts. But the show must go on. So come on, Pasha. Come on. We must have discipline. Show your teeth. Claw at me. Ah! Come on. Ah, come on, Pasha! Come on! Come on! (CAR HORN HONKING) Can't you see I'm busy at the moment? Why don't you let Pasha have a rest? I'm an artist, madam. I'm never satisfied. Cernik's going to Plzen. I told you I was busy. I have plenty of time. Everybody's watching. Come on, Pasha! Strike at me! Tear me to pieces! Come on, Pasha! Strike me. Strike at me. JOE: (SINGING) That day you say you're mine For all of All of time Some lovely... Karel Cernik. You are the owner of the Circus Cernik? No, sir. Bears your name. Yes, sir. I used to own it and my father before me, but... What happened? 1948, when the people's Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia won the victory over fascist imperialism, my circus was nationalized, became the property of the state, like everything else. I was permitted to remain as manager. You have various members of your family with you in this circus. Yes, sir. My wife and my daughter. Your second wife. Yes, sir. My first wife died. She was the mother of my child, Tereza. You and your family form a little clique within the circus. I don't know what you mean, sir. You have private meetings, late at night. Of course. We get together. That's the way with all families, isn't it? Your circus appears to be very cosmopolitan in its personnel. "Cosmopolitan"? International. You have many foreigners on your rolls. French woman, for instance, who calls herself La Duchesse. She's not French, sir. She's certainly no duchess. Years ago, she married a sword-swallower, who called himself The Duke. And when he died, she went a little wrong up here. In a performance in Malacek, she produced a French flag and waved it. That was only in honor of the memory of her husband. I confiscated the flag and burned it. You have a Chinese. Yes, sir. Does he give adherence to the Chinese people's democratic republic, or is he one of the lackeys of the defeated fascist regime? I don't think he knows what he is, sir. He's a juggler. You see, sir, circus people aren't like other people. The only nationality we have, the only religion we have is the circus. We have no politics. We have no home, the circus. Two weeks ago you were ordered by the Ministerium of Propaganda to make certain changes in your performance as a clown. Yes, sir. We made those changes. That was in the act where the other clown kicks me 27 times. Did you continue to do as you had been ordered? Well, to tell the truth, sir... Answer my question. No, sir. I didn't. You went back to doing it just as you had done before. Yes, sir. Why? Well, the way the propaganda officials wanted me to clown, it just wasn't funny. The people didn't laugh. And what do you do? Well, I just stand there. I flinch on each kick, but my expression never changes. And this is considered amusing? The audience thinks so. Can you show us? You mean here? Yes. Now? Mmm-hmm. You have to imagine it in the clown makeup and costume. See, he's trying to make me furious, so that I'll turn around and kick him, but he can't do it. And then finally, he's so tired that he can't lift his foot to kick me again. And then I do turn around... (KISSING)... and I give him a big kiss. The propaganda people said that in this act, Jaromir, that's the other clown, should represent Wall Street imperialism. Silk hat, spats, diamond studs and all that. And I was to be an American negro worker. And we were told to eliminate the kiss at the finish. Well, we tried it that way and they didn't laugh. We worked at it and worked at it, but they didn't laugh. I mean, you can understand that without the unexpected kiss at the finish, it was no good. You have your permit with you? Yes, sir. You'll hand it over to the sergeant. Will it be given back to me? Without that permit, the circus can't continue to move. That will depend. Mr. Chief Inspector, I am not a political man. You will do well to become one. I've been with the circus in this country since I was born. I was here when we were ruled by an emperor in Vienna. I was a performer under the Masaryk and Benes republics, and even under the Nazi tyranny. My circus isn't much anymore, and heaven knows there are better clowns than I. All I ask is to be allowed to continue as a performer. You have shown disobedience which approaches treason. I've never been a traitor. In the past month, I've given seven shows free for the soldiers of our army. You were ordered to give those shows, were you not? Yes, sir, but I was glad to do it. I must warn you, Karel Cernik, that you will obey the instructions that have been given you. You will obey them within 48 hours, or you'll be transferred to a field of activity where you can do more constructive work and less damage. But my circus! Your circus? You've already forgotten it's no longer your circus! It's the property of the state! It'll be subject to liquidation and its properties turned over to your competitor, Vladislav Barovik, who has been far more intelligent in his ability to accommodate himself and his circus to the party line. Now, pay a fine of 100 koruna for failing to do as you were told. You pay the lieutenant outside, and then you may go. But we shall be calling upon you again within 48 hours. (WHISPERING) The duchess. Hmm? Oh! And when you do, we expect that you will have gotten rid of your La Duchesse. Yes, sir. What'll she do? How will she live? That's neither here nor there. Just throw her out. Dismiss her. That's all. Oh, Cernik. One moment. What about that radio receiver? What about it, sir? Is it equipped with a condensator? I'm afraid I don't know what that is, sir. Surely you're a good mechanic, Cernik. You know that a condensator enables you to bring in shortwave broadcasts. I never listen to them, sir. I wouldn't think of it. I'm sure you wouldn't. But as long as the radio is there, others might. I advise you, just to be on the safe side with the police, smash your condensator. Remove temptation. Just look through it. Check it. I know where the radio section would be. If it's in the file, it would be back here. Thank you, sir. May I go now? You may go. There we are. There's nothing in the dossier here about a radio set. Isn't there? Well, sir, what did you think? You made a botch of the interrogation. In what way, sir? I'm not aware that I had departed from my instructions. You told him the circus belonged to the state. Don't you realize there is no state? The circus and everything, but everything, belongs to the people. That's how you should have said it. Ah-ha, yes, sir. I can see my error now, sir. Thank you for pointing it out to me. I'm not going to worry about this man Cernik. He seems to me a dull, uncomplicated clown. Is that what you think, Commissar Sergeant? And what do you think, Comrade Fesker? I think that this man Cernik is far from uncomplicated. Granted that he has never known anything but the life of the circus. Politically, he's an imbecile. I have a feeling that beneath the deceptive exterior, he is profoundly shrewd, subtle. There's something in the back of his mind that might make me... He's a dedicated man with an exalted sense of individuality. He deserves to be watched. Where will that circus be tomorrow? Still in Volary. I'll have a look at it. The Ministerium of Propaganda and their perversities of human nature. All of those superior gentlemen end up in treason to the party. He'd like nothing better than to make fools of us. Well, Comrade, if he's going to be watching that flea-bitten little circus, I'll see to it somebody's watching him. M. 4-2. (BAND PLAYING LIVELY MUSIC) He's here. God be praised. Get into your own outfit. I'll be ready in time. There's no doubt about it now. The police have had a spy in this outfit. Who? We'll find out. Tell the others to meet in the ticket wagon right after the show. Come on. Come on, Pasha. Come on. Come on. Come on, Caesar. Caesar. Good evening, Mr. Cernik. Mr. Cernik. What's the trouble, Rudolf? I know they're all telling you... Telling me what? But it isn't my fault. I can swear to that. Please, Mr. Cernik. Please. Keep her away from me. Rudolf Hubmann, you're the last good lion tamer left in this country. If it weren't for that fact, I should take great pleasure in killing you. Mr. Cernik, the curse of my life is that I'm a handsome man. (DRUM ROLL) There's your cue. Get on with your act. (BAND PLAYING WILLIAM TELL OVERTURE) (BAND STOPS) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (BAND PLAYING DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LA DUCHESSE VOCALIZING) Madame. LA DUCHESSE: Who is it? It's me, Cernik. I must speak to you. I am occupied at the moment. Even so, I have to speak to you. I can hear you quite distinctly from where you are, Cernik. I've been to the police in Plzen. I hope you spat in their faces. No. They were the big police, the SNB. There was an official there from the Propaganda Ministerium in Prague. Swine. Every one of them. They told me I must dismiss you from the circus. Accordingly, I am informing you that you're dismissed as of tomorrow. You will have two weeks' pay. Haven't you anything to say? Go away. KAREL: Madame. Go away. Madame, the dismissal is canceled. Maybe they'll forget about it, or maybe I'll think of something to tell them. But you're not gonna leave my circus. Not as long as I'm manager. Will you please burn that flag? (BAND STOPS) (AUDIENCE MUTTERING) (BAND RESUMES PLAYING) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (BAND PLAYING WALTZ) (HOOTING) (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) TEREZA: Joe. Joe, let's go for a walk. No, I can't. I got work to do. Joe, come on. Joe, come on. There's your father. There's your father. Let's go for a walk. What do you... What do you know about this Joe Vosdek? Not much. He's one of those displaced people. I think the Gestapo killed his father. You ever talk to him? Not much. Only about work. Keeps to himself. Got any friends that you know of? You know yourself. Miss Tereza seems to be friends with him. Uncle! Kalka! Kalka! Kalka? What's he been up to now? Kalka stole something, and Konradin wants to kill him. ZAMA: No! Give it back to me, or I'll kill you! No! Get the fire hose. That'll bring him down. Get the hose. No, no, no! Never mind the hose. What was stolen, Konradin? My crucifix. He stole it. I saw him with it. It's my crucifix. I didn't steal it. I believe you, Kalka! You believe him. I'll cut him in half! KAREL: Get off that rope! Come down off that! Come down here! Come down here! Come down. Come on, Konradin. Get down off of that rope. Get off that rope! Come down! Now, get out of here, all of you. You go to bed. You'll get it back from him. Mr. Cernik? Yes, yes. You'll get it back? Yes! And I'll see you in the ticket wagon later. Now, Kalka, come down. (SPITTING) No. Come down! No! You... Come on down, Kalka. He won't beat you. He can get a job with Barovik's circus. Mr. Barovik himself offered him a job. When did you see Barovik? Mr. Barovik has a real circus. He has four elephants. Come down! You won't be beaten. You promise? Yes. Do you swear that? Yes. Come on down, Kalka. He won't beat you. All right. Come on. Give me the crucifix. Now you can pack your little bag and go to Barovik and his four elephants. You can't do that, Karel. This circus is bad enough already. If you lose Kalka... Here. Now, get out. If you lose Kalka... Come on! Get out! At last you found someone you're not afraid of, a dwarf. How'd they find out? That's what I've been wondering. How? No one who knows about it except the six of us here, my wife and daughter. Whenever it's turned on, it's so low that no one outside the trailer could possibly hear it. No, I... I just cannot suspect any one of you. Perhaps I should, but I can't do it. What about Zama? My wife is my wife. We leave her out of this discussion. Our lives are at stake, Cernik. We can't leave anybody out. If she could betray you in one way... Konradin! I can forgive you for that only because you don't know what you're talking about. So that disposes of everyone except my daughter. Tereza? That's impossible. Thank you, Jaromir, and you're right. But she's a child. She may have talked to someone. She may have innocently told someone what we listen to. And who is that someone? She talks to that silent young man who handles the horses. Joe Vosdek? Joe Vosdek. So he's the spy. Who'd be more likely? We don't know anything about him. Where he came from, who are his friends. As far as I know, he never sends a letter or receives one. But there are lots of people we don't know anything about. That's always the way with the circus. They come and they go, and we don't ask any questions. Do you think he's learned anything definite? No, I don't think so. But I have a feeling that everything's closing in around us. Yeah. Cernik. You know that I've never been backward in my loyalty to you. I'd go along with you wherever you'd lead. But now, you look at that map and you dream. Dream. You seem to have lost the power of action. You've let that woman take the heart out... That's enough, Konradin! Now, get out! (DOOR SHUTTING) Terez. I'm going with you. No, you're not. You don't know where I'm going. Anywhere. You don't even know who I am. I don't care. I know you're the only man I've ever loved, ever wanted. And after today, I know that you love me, too. You've got to love me, Joe, and take me with you. Terez. The first night that it's cloudy and no moon, I'm gonna try to slip across the frontier into the American zone. Where's the frontier? We're very near it right now. We'll be near it for the next few days. Why do you want to do this? Look at that, Terez. You know what that is. It's what is known as a dog tag. When my outfit was stationed near Plymouth in England, some of us had these things tattooed on us. We always felt it was a great joke. We said, "Unless this arm gets blown off, "they'll always be able to identify my grave." Oh, stop. What were you doing in England? I was in the American army. You're an American. A spy. Be a lot better than what I am, a deserter. A lousy deserter. I'm a Czech, Terez. I was born and brought up here. Here. And when I was 14, my father, he saw what was coming. Munich. The Nazis. He got my mother and me and my little sister out of the country. He got us to America. And he stayed behind to close up his business. It was a little factory near Deroun. He never got out. Anyway, while I was in America, I learned to think like an American, to be an American. But I was still a Czech. And I always thought the day might come when I could do something to help liberate my country and find my father. The day of liberation did come, Terez, and I was here. I asked for a pass to go to Deroun to look for my father. They couldn't give it to me because Deroun was beyond the Russian lines. So I thought, "Why not go AWOL for just a few days?" It was easy to get civilian clothes then. Everything was confused. When I got to Deroun, it was nothing but ruins. Ruins. So I walked to another town just beyond it. And I knew I wasn't any longer just AWOL. I was a deserter. I couldn't get back to the Americans. They'd already left Czechoslovakia. But the Russians didn't leave. Joe. My darling Joe. I worked at all kind of jobs. (LAUGHING) I even worked for the Red Army for a while. Can you imagine? I took care of their horses, and I repaired their vehicles. And when the circus came along and your father offered me this job, I jumped at the opportunity, because this was the chance I was waiting for. See, this way I could keep on traveling and keep on hoping I'd find what I was looking for. Did you? A man who'd been in the same concentration camp, he knew my father was dead. But he didn't know how he died. Maybe the gas chamber. Anyway, I'm glad he didn't know. (SNIFFLES) Joe. Look, Terez. I want you to know just one thing. One of these mornings you'll wake up, you'll find that I'm gone. TEREZA: I'm going with you. But I want you to know that I'll always... I'll never forget you. I'm going with you wherever you go I'll go with you. I'll always be grateful for this. Joe. Look... Joe. Tereza. Tereza, come here. I love him. And nothing on God's earth will take me away from him. Go with your father, Terez. Tereza. Tereza! I don't want to cause you any unhappiness, but you're making a mistake. Much bigger than you could possibly know. You're my child, and I've loved you since the instant you were born. You've got to believe me. And you think I'm still the same sweet little bundle of innocence I was then. Well, I've grown up. I'm a woman and I'm going to act like one. Perhaps it would be a good idea for you to pay more attention to your wife and see what she's up to. (HARMONICA PLAYING) Wait a minute, Kalka. I want to wish you good luck. Are you gonna have breakfast, or am I gonna practice? Keep your eye on the target. (CAR HORN HONKING) Send Cernik here. Mr. Barovik wants to see him. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (GASPS) Huh? Oh. What do you want, Barovik? I have one or two business matters to discuss. I'm busy. And I think it advisable to talk in private. Step into my office. Never mind your bodyguards. Nobody's gonna attack you. Good. 'Cause it would be a mistake. I'm not armed. I don't need to be. Now, Barovik... Incidentally, where'd you get that outfit? What do you do, change your clothes with the regime? A man's got to live. What possible business could you have with me, Barovik? Plenty, my friend. Plenty. Don't insult me by calling me your friend. What skullduggery are you up to now? Skullduggery. Listen to the master. Now what I want to know, Cernik, is how much of your show do you really think that you can take with you? With me? Where? Over the border, into the American zone. Into paradise. What are you talking about? I'm talking about your plan. Your wild, crazy, but I must admit, amusing plan to break through the Iron Curtain as that railroad train did last year. You discussed it last night. Had a meeting right here in this ticket wagon. Present were your fellow conspirators, your cousin Jaromir and the rest. I know all the names. You told them about your visit to Plzen. You said that you thought there must be a police spy in your troupe. You suspect the young man, Joe somebody or other. (LAUGHS) Your plan is to filter across the border by degrees, in the dead of night, somewhere in the wild country between Tachov and Moravsky. You'll send an elephant here, an acrobat there, sneaking through the woods where the sentries can't cover every inch. You figure on some losses, but you think that within three nights, you'll have the bulk of your circus across. Where'd you get this information? Not that you'd tell me. Your floorboards are old and loose. Sound seeps through the cracks, and a little man crouching under the wagon... Kalka. I asked him why he brought the information to me rather than to the police. Fortunately for you, the little dwarf is even more terrified of the police than you are. I locked him up. You needn't be afraid of him talking for the time being. In fact, you have nothing to be afraid of except me. Got a match? What do you want out of me, Barovik? Nothing. Nothing whatsoever. I merely came to warn an old friend. For God's sake, Barovik. Tell me what you want. No more than the leavings, Cernik. Certainly you don't imagine to get your whole show across. No. I shall be leaving the tents. All of them. Are they in good condition? Is anything in good condition these days? Very well. I accept the tents. The seating. You can have the seating. The equipment? You can have all the heavy equipment. The lions? No. Elephants? No! Think I'd leave any of my performers behind? You can have the wolves. They don't perform. But you'll have to round them up. I'm gonna release them at the frontier to create a diversion. You've worked this down to the last detail, haven't you, my friend? For three years, I've been thinking about nothing else. I told the police in Plzen that I'm not political, and that's the truth. But when they try to force their politics on my circus, on my show, then I must fight them. If I'm not able to fight them, I must escape from them. And I'll make that attempt, whatever the cost. Cernik, I've always given you credit for being a good circus man. And all circus men are fools, otherwise we wouldn't be in the business. But, you know, you're the biggest fool of us all. Don't you realize that your plan is now impossible? They've cut down every tree. They've demolished every house for the depth of a mile all along the border. They've mined every field. They've put up three rows of barbed wire fences, one of them electrified. I learned all that yesterday on my way back from Plzen. I'm not gonna try to filter across. I'm going the direct route, right down the road. And all at once. It's impossible. The very fact that it's impossible could work to our advantage. When are you gonna try it? Tomorrow? Friday? Today. Today? Are you ready? No. But with you in possession of the secret and Kalka, I couldn't run the risk of any delay. I know I couldn't trust you any further than I could see. We'll make the dash this afternoon. Yeah, I got to do it in broad daylight. That's the one thing they'd never expect. Life won't seem nearly as interesting with you in your grave, Cernik. (CLICKING TONGUE) Ah! Everything's changing. You know that wonderful rope act I used to do? Oh! That one. No, no. The one I used to do personally. Oh. You know what they've done? They made me take it out. No. Why? Yeah. They said it was western. Oh, shh! What's worse, American. Shh. Oh, I know. I know. No. No, thanks. Well, I'll be sorry to lose you, Cernik. Well, who knows? A miracle might happen and a few of you might get through alive. Wait a minute. You and I better have a fight. A fight? Yes. You hit me. I hit you. We roll on the floor, knock over furniture, break things, make an uproar. But why? The spies in the circus will report to the police that you and I have had another of our little disagreements. Otherwise, you'll be suspected, too. What are you smiling at? Are you sure you're in condition for a fight? Never mind that. Never mind that. The police will be alerted for trouble, but not the real trouble. Come on. Come on, Barovik. Don't just stand there laughing out of your ugly mouth. Why, you couldn't even get through a mock fight. We'll see about that. Come on. With pleasure. Wait a minute, Barovik. First I have to ask you a question. For as long as we've known each other... Out of breath already. ...which is quite a number of years, you've been hoping and praying I'd fall off that tightrope and break my neck. That's correct. Now you know enough about me to have me arrested and tortured and hanged, thrown in the lion pit. That's correct, too. Then why'd you come here and go through all this rigmarole of making a business deal? Why didn't you just turn me in to the police and take all of my circus for nothing? You mean to say you couldn't answer that question yourself? No. You'd do exactly the same thing if you put yourself in my place. I don't want to put myself in your place, Barovik. Answer the question. Why are you suddenly acting like a decent person? Cernik, it's true. I have no more love for you than you have for me. We would both cheerfully rob each other or cut each other's throats. But we are together on one thing. We're both circus men. First, last, and always. We hate the government, and we hate the police. Mmm-hmm. And when it comes to a question of the circus against the law, you know which side I'm on. Mmm, that's right. I see that. That makes sense. Well, you ready? Hmm? Oh, yeah. Fight. All right. Hit me. No. You gotta start. No, no, no. Please. Please. You hit me. It was your suggestion. No, but just hit me, please. As a matter of fact, I sprained my hand last week. (GRUNTS IN PAIN) I'm terribly sorry. Then push me. Push me. Yeah. (LAUGHING) Wait a minute. Not my window. I just said break the furniture. Oh, you didn't need to do that. Not on my face. Cernik, open the door. Cernik. Cernik! Open the door! Cernik! Cernik, open the door! Cernik, open the door! Cernik! Take that, Cernik! The great Barovik. The greatest rope act of all time! (EXCLAIMS) So you didn't like my rope act, eh? (YELLING) No! That's a present. My 25th jubilee. Cernik. Cernik. Open the door. Cernik. Cernik! Cernik. Cernik. Open it. Open it. Cernik. Cernik, Cernik. Open the door. Karel. (CRASHING STOPS) You think that's enough? I think that should be about enough. Little statue all right? Yeah, it's intact. And I think you'd better... A little more. Yeah, yeah. Give me some of that. Sure. Help yourself. How's that look? Yeah? That looks pretty good. You better take your coat off. Be more convincing. Yeah, yeah. What about your collar and your tie? Yeah. Thanks. And I'll send the trucks to Mikulov. Mikulov. Yeah. All right. I'll pick them up there. Good. Wait a minute. Here we are. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good touch. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Thanks. Yeah. Good luck, Cernik. Same to you. Same to you. Yeah. Don't forget your revolver. My revolver. Here it is. Here. Would you kindly return my matches? Oh! I forgot all about them. Thanks. Sorry. It's perfectly all right. But, you know, I feel much better. Do you? Much. Let's go. KAREL: Get out. Get out. If you ever come around my circus again, Barovik, I'll feed you to the wolves! You haven't heard the last of this, Cernik! Not by a long shot! Leave him alone. Don't lay a hand on him. Let him go. They won't trouble us again. Karel, are you hurt? Of course I'm hurt. Jaromir, Konradin. TEREZA: Are you all right? Yeah. Vosdek. Excuse me, please. We move. As fast as possible. We haven't got enough gas to get to Yudice. We got enough to get to the frontier. Now? Now. But you're sentencing every one of us to death. We're dead now. This is our last chance to be alive again. Now get to work. What about the others? Should we assemble and tell them? No, no. If we get across and any are foolish enough to want to come back, they're free to do so. They'll all get killed. That's liberation, too. Vosdek. Go on. Go on. Yes, sir. Vosdek, the tent wagons move out two hours ahead of the rest of the circus. I want you to go with them, take charge of them. I have other work for Krofta. We'll meet in Mikulov. Yes, sir. I'm going with you, Joe. No, you're not. I'm scared, Joe. I'm scared you'll try to make your escape before the rest of us catch up with you. In daylight? No, Terez. Joe, I'm going with you. What did Barovik want of you? Your hide? He came as a friend. Ha! A friend. He gave you a good beating, all right. What made you decide to stop being a man and turn into a crawling little worm? When I first met you, you were a great man. Circus Cernik was famous all over Europe. Kings and queens asked you to perform at their courts. The greatest circus people came to you. Ringling, Hagenback, Krone. They wanted to study at Circus Cernik, and maybe steal from it. And now look at you. You let Barovik beat you. You let the police beat you. Why don't you stand up to them like a man? Why? Why? You haven't even got enough spirit to answer me. Jaromir. What? Those tent wagons have gotta move out by 10:00. Tell them to put every man they can on it. Speed up the loading. All right. You know why I did that. You should have done it a long time ago. COMMENTATOR ON RADIO: And swings. He connects. There it goes. It's still going. A long, hard-hit ball. It's in there. It's a home run. SOLDIER: What happened? I wonder what that is they're drinking up there. Every day the same rations. Let me take a look. Here comes scooter Rizzuto to the plate. Roe shakes his head at Campanella. He seems a little jittery out there now. I don't know what it is. Some kind of Schnapps. I wonder what it is they're drinking. Hello. Hello. Hello. Three men. Civilians. Yes? Yes. All right. Captain, sir. Three men, civilians, in a jeep at Sentry Point 152. Tell them to find out who they are. Yes, sir. SOLDIER: All right. (PHONE RINGING) What was that? Must mean they've seen us from the watchtower. Hello? Sentry Point 152. Sentry Point 152. I must remember that. They are circus people. Name is Circus Cernik. Their papers are in order. Yes. Yes. Their papers are in order. Their circus will pass later today along the road from Volary to Mikulov. They must always reconnoiter travel routes to find suitable places for resting and watering the animals. That's their problem. Let me eat. It's all right. (KAREL WHISTLING) Just stand facing me so you can see down the hill. Don't keep looking in one direction. Give me a cigarette, Jaromir. (CLEARING THROAT) We're being watched from above. Just chat casually. That river is the frontier. The moment we go over this crest, we'll be plainly visible from down there. Those long, low buildings are the barracks. All along the river, there are rows of barbed wire, electrified wire as well. Mines, too. The road's clear. The bridge is clear. There's a ditch across the road. Yeah. They know it's utterly impossible for anyone to escape at this point. That's to our advantage. There's Bavaria. Bavaria. Good day to you, sir. Kopatchin. I want you to release the wolves when you approach the command post at the frontier. Right, sir. That'll be the signal for the bomb, and full speed ahead. We'll abandon every vehicle we can. All the animals except the cats. We'll proceed the last stage of the way on foot. What's this? What's this? Why aren't they busy loading? Because I don't like it. You don't like... Wait. This is a fine time to find out you don't like the work you've been doing with me for 20 years. May I have a word with you, Mr. Cernik? Certainly. Are we moving? Good. We're moving. (HARMONICA PLAYING) Make it quick, Krofta. We're in a hurry. Mr. Cernik, what's the meaning of all these changes? We're heading for Mikulov. We should be going to Yudice in the opposite direction. I have orders to give a show for troops. Well, then why isn't Jaromir going ahead to pick out the lot, the way he usually does? Why aren't I with the tent wagons where I belong? Why have you put Vosdek in my place? What does he know about canvas? No, Mr. Cernik, there's something going on around here, and I don't like it. I haven't time to explain the whole thing to you, Krofta. I made a deal with Barovik. A very satisfactory deal. I have to keep it quiet for the time being. So, get on with your work. Do the police know about this? This is of no interest to the police. Have you got a permit for Mikulov? Of course I have. You think I'd be... Let me see it. Let me see it. Krofta, have you forgotten who's the boss of this troupe? No, Mr. Cernik. But I'm afraid you've forgotten something, something very important. These aren't the old days. You don't own this circus anymore. You don't own me. I'm the leader of the tent men, the real workers in this circus. And I'm telling you for your own good, Mr. Cernik. You're headed for serious trouble if you don't change these orders you've give... (HAMMER THUDS) (THUDS) Hmm. Konradin. Get some cord. Tie him up. Gag him. So he's the one. Of course he is. He said the tent men are the only real workers in this circus. That means the rest of us are parasites. All we do is entertain the people. Poor unhappy people. My old friend. Twenty years. He'd have turned me in. Shove him under the tool bench. Put some canvas over him. Get these men working. I want this whole thing loaded by the time I get back. Be about an hour. MAN: Where's Krofta? Vosdek takes charge of the tent wagons. That means I get rid of him. Krofta did me a good turn. Reminded me I haven't a travel permit for Mikulov. I'm going to the district police station to get it. So, while I'm away... Good morning, sir. I hear you had a visit from your old friend Barovik. Not an entirely friendly visit either. It was merely a little argument. What can I do for you, sir? Nothing, really. I just wanted to have a look around. Isn't that your mother? Yes. I seem to recall she was a performer, too. She was once known as the strongest woman in Europe. Didn't she work with lions? Oh, yes, 18 male lions. Oh, yes. I'd really like to look around a little. Unfortunately, we're just about to move. It's all interesting. I'll get someone to show you around. I'm very sorry, but I have to go to the district police station. Oh. Why, it's merely a matter of making out the usual forms for a travel permit. Haven't you a travel permit yet? Yes. Yes, but there's been a change of plan. We're going to Mikulov today. I see. I'll accompany you to the police station. So, good-bye. Bring him up. Bring that circus man up here. MAN: Cernik. I was right. We looked here and they looked at headquarters in Plzen. We can't find anything about a change in route for this circus. Why do you want to go to Mikulov? Circus Barovik is in that region. You want to set up in competition? No, sir, nothing like that. Barovik and I are making some trades. I have some... Have you and Barovik agreed on this? Yes, sir, we've agreed on everything. But you said you had a disagreement. Yes, sir, I know, but... Why did you fight with him? We always fight, just for old time's sake. Even when there's no cause for it. Why are you so nervous, Cernik? Well, sir, it's difficult to be completely at ease in the presence of the police. It's so easy to imagine all sorts of crimes that do not exist. You are right, Cernik. It is easy to imagine. What is not easy is arriving at the precise facts. But you need not worry. We wish no harm to you or your circus. We are fully aware that you are performing a service to the party by promoting morale. We are not as rigid as we seem to be. We know that there must be a place in the system for circuses, as well as doctrines. You will go outside and wait. But I've got to have that permit, sir, and right away. If we don't get on the road soon... You were told to go outside and wait. A highly unskilled liar. In fact, he's what used to be known as an honest man. Do you agree? Yes, Comrade Fesker. An honest man. And therefore dangerous. I am now convinced that this Cernik is on the verge of making a serious, perhaps fatal mistake. The thing to do is to let him make it, and then we can take appropriate measures. So give him his permit. But I'm not sure, sir, that I have authority for that. Don't worry, Captain. I'll take full responsibility. Get me the Commissar Sergeant at 42-M, Plzen. Margaret, take the baby. Thank God he's there. Come on. Give you the permit? They gave it to me. I don't know why. Did they question you? They questioned me for the last time. Do they suspect something? Yes, but I don't think they're sure just what it is they suspect. Get a little gas put in this, and have it coupled to my trailer. Krofta all right? Conscious but helpless. I hope he has a safe journey to Bavaria. Isn't that overdoing it a little? Get into your other outfit. Rudolf. Why aren't you ready? We're about to roll. I'm ready, sir. Leo, the cages. All right, Rudolf. By the way, we must be prepared for some trouble today. Trouble? I swear to you there is nothing between Madam Cernik and me. Nothing. I know there isn't. That isn't what I'm talking about. We're going to cross the path of the Circus Barovik today. I want you to put live ammunition in your pistol. There may be shooting. (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE) If any of Barovik's men should take a shot at you, threaten to open the cage and let the cats out. But don't, under any circumstances, do it. We can't afford to lose them, or you either. Don't worry, Mr. Cernik. I haven't learnt to use the whip for nothing. (EXCLAIMING) (WHIP CRACKING) Huh? Just stay in the cage with the lions. You'll be safe in there. I know you're a miserable coward, Rudolf. Outside of the lions' cage, of course. What's the matter, Karel? You look happy. I look that way because that's the way I feel. I want some coffee. I'm starving. You sit down. I'll make it for you. Where's Tereza? Somewhere about. I saw her a few minutes ago. What are all the flags for? Is it some kind of holiday? That's what it is. Give me some bread, Zama. There's something going on here, and you're very pleased about it. What is it? I'm disobeying my own orders. You remember how I'd listen to the broadcasts? About all those people who've escaped? About that railroad train that broke through? I knew that was what you had in your mind. I've known it for a long time. But I never dreamed you'd ever have the courage to do it. Karel, when do we go? Few minutes. I'll be ready. The tent wagons left two hours ago. I know. You'll never see them again. I know, I know. I couldn't risk the frontier with all that heavy stuff. Of course you couldn't. I sent Vosdek with them so he'd be out of our lives forever. No. He's gone for good. (GROANS) Oh! Tereza went with him on the tent wagon. You told me you'd just seen her. I know I did. I was lying. She went with Vosdek? Yes. Tereza? I... Oh, boy. I... Oh, my God. Karel. Karel, how could she know? How could I know? Get out. Get out. Don't be cruel to her. Understand her. KONRADIN: We're ready. Are you giving the signal to roll? KAREL: Roll. Roll. Roll. Roll. Where are you going? Going to go over the Mikulov road to the tent wagons. Why in the name of... Tereza. She went with Vosdek. Cernik. KONRADIN: Let's go. Come on. Let's roll. Cernik. You'll proceed as planned to the bivouac point. Wait there. What is this? Tereza. She went with Vosdek. Water the horses, feed them. Do anything to make it look normal. You can't leave us now. I'll be back in time. We're rolling. I'll be back in time. Let the girl go. What did you say? Take your hands off me. We're rolling. Let them roll. Come on. Roll them. Roll them. Let them roll. Let them roll. Come on. (HORN HONKING) Where is she? Who? Tereza. She's not here. Don't play jokes with me, Vosdek. Where is she? She's not here, Mr. Cernik. Not here, eh? Mr. Cernik, I didn't know. I didn't... (JOE GRUNTS) Joe. Joe. Joe, are you all right? Are you all right? Joe, I'm never gonna leave you. Never. You're coming with me now. Joe. He'd have given us all to the police. He's an American soldier. He's hiding from the police. You don't know what you're talking about. He's an American. Look. There's the proof. He's going across the frontier. He's going back to the Americans, and I'm going with him. (CRYING) Oh! Is that true? I'm going to try. Then get into the jeep. I told you, get into that jeep. I can use you. I'm gonna try it myself. TEREZA: Come on. Come on. (BAND PLAYING FUNERAL MARCH) (DOG BARKING) We're going. I'll be ready. Don't gather. Keep at your work. I'll talk to you one at a time. Everything in order? I hope so. Have you decided if the situation's right? Yeah. The road down there is clear. We're going. But what are we going to do about this guard? Would you take a chance on firing a shot? Talk to Vosdek. He'll attend to it. It's starting. Don't seem to be watching. He's trained in this kind of thing. Here, Heidi. Come, Heidi. Here, Heidi. Come. Get away. Get away. Get this dog away. JOE: Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Come on. Come, Heidi. Get out. Get this dog away. Take this dog away. Take the... (PUNCHES LANDING) (BARKING CONTINUES) (SHOUTING) Get into his uniform. (PLAYING LIVELY TUNE) On your horses. Help her up. Tereza, why aren't you dressed? Hurry. Bratislav, load them in. Give the instructions about taking cover behind the sandbags. If there's shooting, they must keep down, even if they're piled on top of each other. Tell them to make the children keep down. Konradin, have you got my trailer at the end of the line? It's there, Cernik. We're not taking the commissary. We're not taking any of the trailers except the animals. Ditch the others. Right. You know you won't be able to take that. I know, sir. Vosdek. Vosdek. You ride on top of the first car. Try to look official, as if you were escorting us. If they ask any questions, you don't know anything except that you're obeying orders that came though from Plzen. Yes, sir. Watch out for Tereza. Jaromir, give Joe the bomb and his instructions. All right, Karel, but the chances are... It's homemade, so be careful with it. Chances are... Vosdek, it may not work at all, or it may go off too soon. Hey, you look pretty good. Yeah. Real sharp. You ready? Yes, sir. Yes. Vosdek will give you the signal. Right. When the Chinaman releases the wolves at the command post, accelerate. Right. Step on it. Hit that barrier as hard as you can and keep going. Don't leave any block for Tereza and the ponies. Yes, sir. But at the start, the pace is slow. Slow. Slow, yeah. When they see us creeping down that hill at the pace of the elephants, they'll be certain we can't be trying anything desperate. You see? Kalka's back. I've noticed. I am back, Mr. Cernik. So I see. Let me come with you. They travel at a very slow pace because of the elephants. I'll have some men from the Volary station with me, and I want you to alert the Mikulov station. Can I count on you? Good. (INDISTINCT) Father. Yes? I guess we're ready. You all know your responsibilities. I'll give the command to roll from the back. Listen, Cernik. What? I still say you should be at the head of the procession. You should lead us across. No. But... He thinks if anybody gets left behind, it should be him. You know how it is on the sea. The captain's always the last. But the elephants should be last. They're the slowest. But he wants to be the last one to cross the frontier. We'll see. (GRUNTS) (PHONE RINGING) Max. Sentry Point 152. (CLEARING THROAT) Krofta. I thought you were down with the tent wagon. Still here. They say they have orders to give a free show. Yes, sir. Right. Cut the wire. Good afternoon, Commissar Sergeant. I'm going after that circus. You're coming with me. Plzen? Possibly beyond Plzen. Have you a warrant for my arrest? And the charges? Of course, you've been ordered not to tell me anything. Don't worry. There'll be plenty of charges. I know. I was sure that sooner or later you'd exceed your authority. You have. You ordered the granting of an illegal permit to that circus. Get in the car. Will you send some men after that circus? We'll take care of it in due time. It's got to be now. They're planning an escape. Where did you get that idea from? Where did I get it? From my fertile imagination, Sergeant. I tried to think like a circus man. Tell my superiors all about it in Prague. From now on, Fesker, you need not worry about anything, except yourself. I understand. Sooner or later, it happens to all of us. We're going, Zama. All I have to do is give the word. Give the word, Karel. I'm ready. It's one of two things. It's the end for us, or it's the beginning. Now, Cernik, give the order to stop. Stop? Give the order to stop this criminal escape. Give the order. It's too late, Krofta. No, it's not too late. Give the order. Just stop and think what you're doing. I've heard enough, Cernik. I've heard enough in that trailer to... Traitor. Traitor. Traitor! Krofta, you've got to be reasonable about this thing. You're a traitor! Then why don't you shoot me? (STAMMERING) Because it's my duty to turn you over to the police, so they can get out of you all the details of this plot. Now, give the order! Well, if you can convince me... Cernik, you're asking for death. I've done that already. I can get you mercy. Did you think what could happen to your wife? Give the order. Your daughter... You give the order. Your circus... ZAMA: Get out! (GUNSHOTS) (DOGS BARKING) (GUNSHOTS) Jaromir. Jaromir. (BACKFIRING) KAREL: Konradin. Konradin. Yes, sir? What is it? Get the circus rolling. I will. I will. Get them rolling. Roll. He said to roll. (BAND PLAYING FUNERAL MARCH) MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER: This is the Circus Cernik. (PLAYING LIVELY MUSIC) This is the Circus Cernik. KAREL: Slowly. (GRUNTS) This is the Circus Cernik. Look at what they get for entertainment. A circus, for Pete's sake. This is the Circus Cernik. Tower reports an SNB man on lead vehicle of circus, traveling at slow rate. Followed by horses and vehicles which appear to be animal cages. Two elephants. Headquarters. Why couldn't they have given me notice? (BAND CONTINUES PLAYING) Put through a call to Plzen. Yes, sir. (BARKING) Now, what am I supposed to do with a circus? Morale show. Will somebody please tell me where I am to find a place for them? This is the Circus Cernik. Did you get headquarters? The line seems to be dead. I can't raise anything. Send a man to question the guard with the circus. Do it yourself. And find out what his orders are. Holy cow. What are your orders? To escort this outfit here. They're giving a performance for the personnel. This is the Circus Cernik. (TRUMPETING) Your hat, sir. (ALL LAUGHING) (DOGS BARKING) Go! Sound the alarm! (ALARM BLARING) (GUNSHOTS) Take it easy. Don't get itchy. Fire. Fire! Bitte? Macht nichts to us. Faster! Come! Fast! (WOMAN SCREAMING) (ELEPHANT TRUMPETING) (GUNSHOTS) (GUNSHOTS CONTINUE) Hold your fire! Hold your fire! No shooting across the river! No shooting across the river! No shooting across the river! Stop firing! SOLDIER: Get that away. Sergeant. Yes, sir? Straighten out the picture. Yes, sir. Two men here. Are we over? Yes. Yes, we're over. Tereza? She's all right. And the elephants? Yes. The lions? Yes. Then we've done it. We've done it. You've done it, Karel. You've won. You're gonna be well, and you're gonna be happy. I'm gonna die, my darling. No. (SOBBING) (LAUGHING) Start the parade. We give a performance tonight. We celebrate. We're free, Zama, you and I, Tereza, the circus. No. (CRYING) JOE: It's all right. It's all right. Is he dead? Yes, he's dead. He got us across, and he paid for it. He was glad to pay. (GASPS) Don't just stand there. You heard what she said. Go on. (BAND PLAYING LIVELY MUSIC)
