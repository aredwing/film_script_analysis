Look, he's not all that anyway. - But I like him. - Marisol, it's a free country. Just because you have a crush on him doesn't mean you own him. You didn't even notice him until you found out I liked him. - Please. Get over yourself. - It's true. You could have any boy you want in this school, and you choose him. Look, nothing happened. Okay? Can we be friends now? You fucked him. I did not. You're lying. You had sex with him? Guzman, you suck. It didn't mean anything to me. If he prefers me over you, is that my problem? Maybe it's time you took a look in the mirror. It's time for a makeover. Apologize to her. - Excuse me? - You heard me. Say you're sorry. Yeah, right. Come on, girls, let's bounce. I'm telling you, that bitch is psycho. Get off me, you fuckin' bitch! Jesus. American Gladiators. Show's over. You kids are late for class. You're fucking crazy, Guzman! - You started it, you fuckin' bitch! - Enough! - She's lying! - Yo, Tiny, check your sister! - You know what you did. - Both of you are at fault. - I didn't do nothing! - Except be your stinky, skanky self. I said hustle, or all of you end up in detention! Report after school, or you're suspended. See you. You are another story. Now come on. This is your fourth fight this semester. You simply can't continue to behave like this. Have you ever considered how much more effective it would be... to talk about your disagreement? You have a serious problem. In or out of school, your life is only gonna get harder because of it. You might want us to find someone who can help you deal with this. I don't need any help. Fine. It's up to you. I am out of options. One more fight, and you're expelled. Who cares if I'm expelled? Diana, ask yourself that question. Up the ante. Up. - Money on the wood. - Hey there, it's Diana. Oh, yeah, the gym's probably closed by now. - I got held up at school. - You in trouble again? Here. Tell Hector I'll have the rest for him next week. Not after this game. - Where am I going? - Take the 61 to York. It's near the water. Why you sending your girl down there? 'Cause she's paying Hector. My good man from Panama's training Tiny. Man, you're the living likeness of your mother. - I was just saying... - Just play. Later. You need some variety. I give it to you. I'm looking for Hector. The ring in the back. The right, Tiny. Remember your combinations, Tiny. - Last round. - You said we go to four. He's not ready. Not ready, huh? Where the hell's Don? - What's up? - You better keep your eye on this bozo. - He don't listen to a word I say. - Well, make him listen. What the fuck? That's my brother, you little shit. Let me go! I'm gonna get her! I gotta put you in a cage? - The ho hit me first. - I mean that crap in the ring. It's embarrassing. Being beaten twice in a day makes me look like a pussy. Hey, watch your mouth. - Why'd you mess with Ray like that? - He's a punk, Tiny. - We were sparring. - It didn't look that way to me. Here, this is from my dad. You Sandro's kid too? - How come I never heard about you? - I don't know. I'm his pride and joy. Jesus Christ. Nice meeting you. Yeah. You been humiliated. You fight dirty with a little kid. Then you got slaped by a little girl. That's weak, Ray. The bitch is lucky I didn't kill her. - You spared her some mighty force, huh? - That's right. Who's the dish? Should have me a taste and find out. Little man. - You know I was just playin', right? - I know. Can we shake? Thought you had a friend. Come on, man. Hey, killer. I forgive you too. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I mean, I guess you never learned how to be a lady. You shouldn't hit people like that. I couldn't resist. Tiny, let's go. Got that scholarship application I told you about. - For that art school? - Yeah. It's cool. You gotta learn all kinds of stuff before you can do any work. You know, to get a foundation. You would think that's cool. Sounds like a waste of time to me. Learn how to draw. What's that gonna get you, Tiny? Ajob painting somebody's house out in Long Island somewhere? Maybe. Edward clean you out like he said he would? Yeah, well, he screws himself when he talks like that. I'm not finished. I know. So, how was school, champ? It was okay. Lots of excitement. When I was a kid, school was so boring... I thought I'd piss in my pants waiting to get out in the world. So, did it happen? What? Did you get out in the world? What kind of question is that? Dad. It's Ms. Martinez. When? No, she didn't mention it. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Why you always gotta fuck up like this, huh? Veronica asked for it. You embarrass me. Sometimes I don't even think you're mine. Maybe I'm not your kid. That better be cleaned up by the time I come back. If I was enough of a skeez, I could pull that off. Why would you want to? Veronica say anything to you? Yeah, if she wants to choke on her teeth. Always with that damn mirror of hers. "Let me get made up just perfect so I can suck your dick... which is all I'm good for anyway." - Let it rest with her already. - How come? Because she can be bitchy, but that's not all she's about. - Some fucking loyalty. - Don't be like that. She treats you like shit. WHy take her side? Diana, I don't take sides. Veronica don't even mean half the stuff she says. Look, I just wanna be friends with everybody. That's the way I am. Yeah, well, I hate her, and that's the way I am. Set his wife on fire, then fatally shot himself. Neighbors of the slain woman expressed shock and sorrow today as... Knock knock. It was open. You here to beat me up? Remember her from the other day? The bare knuckles. You should've seen Ray's face. Hey, I'm trying to say something. I wanna train with you. I wanna be a boxer. Sure. It's a great workout. No, for real. I wanna fight. - You can train, but you can't fight. - Why not? You just can't. Girls don't have the same power as boys. Why not aerobics? Am I talking to you? Nice. There's plenty of things you can do better with your life than box. Prove it. You got money? 'Cause I don't work for free. A little. I charge $10 a session, and that's cut-rate. I don't have that kind of cash. Well, there you go. - Dad? - Hmm? You know how you pay for Tiny to train with Hector? Well, I was thinking on how that's like an allowance. And I should get one too. It's not an allowance. Then what is it? I'm preparing him for the world out there. - Yeah, but... - Look, it's insurance. These kids are gonna eat him alive. - That's not true. - Tiny, it is true. What if he doesn't want to box? Sure, he wants to. What kid wouldn't? He could go to college, Dad. He could do all sorts of stuff with himself. You think I don't know that? You think this is just spending money for him? He ain't over at A&S Plaza buying lipstick or whatever you girls do there. Please. Don't front like I'm some girly-girl when you know I'm not. Would it kill you to wear a skirt once in a while? Look, your mother was a receptionist... in a very nice office. You want some extra money, get a job. I ain't giving you anything until you show me you deserve it. It's not like you give me anything anyway. You think I don't hear you? Shut up, already. Stop doing that. You again. Relax. Jab. Jab. What are you doing here? - I got the money. - I didn't promise nothing. You said once I got the cash. You seem like a nice kid. It's just not right. Diana... This is bullshit. You said once I got the money, and now I do. Wait a minute. You're gonna train with Hector? Yeah. - Why? - Why not? Well, what about Papi? - You tell Dad, and I'll kill you. - Take it easy! Please. I'll train you. You will? If you don't sweat for me, you're out of my life. Got it? - Got it. - Oh, man! Tiny, come on. Fuck. Now he hates me. Rule number one... no personal business in the gym. Watch me. Hands close to your body, hands up to your face. Jab. Snap, snap. Springs back to you. Snap, snap, springs back to you. Twist it. Now throw the right. Soon you won't think while you're doing this. You'll be daydreaming. What's that, huh? What's that? You got no balance that way. Better. Nothing stays still in the ring. Move around the bag more. Watch your footwork. You can't stop. Ninety-eight... ninety-nine... Come on, last one. You're done for today. Go see Ira about getting a locker. Sure, he'll make the weight. The kid's been sleeping in Saran Wrap for the past two weeks. Hey, who's bright idea was it to keep him at junior lightweight, anyway? Exactly. Saturday, he'll be at 29. Okay. Talk to you later. You're the girl Hector told me about. - You need a locker. - Yeah. Well, we ain't big-time, hon. We're not really set up for the ladies yet. This neighborhood don't really catch on with the lawyer types. We don't use this too much anymore. It's yours if you want to throw your stuff somewhere. Thanks. Okay, what is mass? Mass is the measure of a body's resistance... to acceleration. It is different from but proportional to that body's weight. What is weight? Weight is the gravitational force... exerted by the Earth on that body. Now, this is why... if a body is outside the Earth's gravitational pull... Girls. I think you both know how this works. - Yes, Mr. Coolidge. - Yes, Mr. Coolidge. This is why... Make a fist. How's that feel? Feels good. Jab, jab. Jab, right. Good, now jab, right, hook. Too wide. - How long is this going to last? - What are you talking about? "What are you talking about?" Stop being such a tough guy. What do you gotta do this for? You can't pay for it. - What do you care? - You should tell Dad. Are you for real? This would drive him nuts. - Keep your mouth shut. - I can't believe you sometimes. You still got two rounds. Yeah, but I can't do it right. Then get back over there till you can. But it's pissing me off. It's pissing you off? What, do you think this is gonna happen overnight? Huh? You think it came natural to these guys? You think it's gonna come natural to you? Huh? This time work the bag slow and steady... and don't stop till the red light goes out. What you laughing at? You laughing at me? Huh? Oh, mira, look. Your bodyguard. Guess the slave girls get a day off when you slum it with Marisol. I've had it with your dismal crap. You're sick. - You don't even know me. - I know all I have to. - Quit it. - She hangs out with you to get to me. You should know. You're the center of the universe, right? It's the truth. We're gonna be late. Later, Diana. You said you'd do my braids. Yeah? Well, call me when there's an opening in your busy schedule. Jab, jab. Jab, jab, right. Too much power. Let's just box for now. Hey, you deaf? I said too much power. Jab, right, hook. You been working on your hook. This time finish it with an uppercut. Same combination. All force and no technique, huh? Come on. Power is half the story. Are you scared of me? - That's funny. You look scared. - I'm not scared. I got you against the ropes, and I'm gonna dance on your face. See? Someone gets you where you don't wanna be, you get outta the way. Keep your footwork smaller. That way you can punch from different angles, okay? Try it. Now we're boxing. You should start roadwork. Run three miles four times a week. Three miles? You gotta be kidding me. At least three. At this rate, you couldn't last one round in the ring. But I got power. You said so. Big deal. You got the endurance of a corpse. I guess I'll use the track at school. Don't bother about clocking yourself yet. So were you ever a fighter? Oh, sure. In Panama. I had my day once. So, what happened? What happens to most of us who do it? We lose. There's only two of you in that ring. It can be a lonely place. How're you doin'? Have you seen Adrian? Yo, Adrian! You got a visitor. Most of these guys here, what are they... just dreamin'? Sure, they are. They got no choice. These guys, this is what they live for. This is their whole life. Was it like that for you? To fight? Probably not. I didn't have what it takes. So what does it take? To be great, I mean. I don't know. A real strong will. I was gonna go to a fight at the Forum next week. If you want to see some lightweight action... Ira gets discount tickets sometimes. I can come? It's no big thing. For real? Maybe you'll learn something. Yeah. Oh, here. Thanks. I hope you've all completed the assigned reading... and finished your workbooks. This chapter deals with... a fundamental concept in science... the second law of thermodynamics. The primary element of this law... is a word that we use all the time... though it's tough to define. That word is "heat." What is heat anyway? A simple definition is this: Heat is the energy possessed by molecules... because of their motion. It takes part in every physical occurrence... from the growth of one blade of grass... to... a key starting a car's engine... to the explosion of a star. Testing those reflexes. Friday you spar. I'm ready to? You're a quick study. I am? You gotta pay me for last week. - It's real silver. - I can't sell it with these pictures. Strangers to everyone but you, huh? Yeah. - I'll give you 40 bucks for it. - That's all? It's not worth more than that. Sixty. Gimme a break. Please? I'll give you 50 bucks. Final offer. You sure this is a good idea? Ray knows... no funny stuff. Try to be a gentleman. Just keep it loose. No pressure. Take it easy on me this time, okay? Don't be a dick, and I'll try. Why did he have to say that? Ignore him. Here. How's it workin' with her? Gotta pay the bills. When you get that desperate, borrow from me. Hey, Frankie, let's put in some quality time. - Sorry. - Come on! Don't be sorry. Don't ever be sorry. Look at him. Okay. Whey you throw your jab... Spit. Rush him with some of the combinations we been working on, okay? It's like I forgot everything you've been teaching me. Stop thinking so much. You're doin' good. You've been working hard. - Yeah, I guess so. - Guess so? Cal's got you conditioned real good. Thanks. I'll be seeing you, Hector. - How you gettin' home? - The 61. I'm in Red Hook. I'm driving that way. I don't mind the bus. This place is deserted at night. - I'll be fine. - It's okay. No trouble. I'm just in Gowanus. The "F" and the "G" are my nightmare trains. "G" is the worst. No wonder people move out of Queens. You're lucky you have wheels. Lucky's winning the lottery. My old man, he's a mechanic. He has me running all around Brooklyn, running errands for this ride. Always gotta be thinking "expansion." Anyway, you in high school? Yeah, my last year, I hope. You still in school? - Am I immature or somethin'? - No, I just thought... I'm just playing with you. I graduated last year. - My only achievement in life. - Yeah, right. It's true. My mom cried when I got my diploma. That's nice. You gotta tell me where to turn. We can stop right here. - Right over here? - Yeah. You live in a project? All my life. Canales Community Houses. What floor you on? The 11 th. - You're up there. - Yeah. Thanks for the ride. I'll be seeing you. What? - You're late. - I was hanging out with Marisol. - Thank your brother for dinner. - Thanks, bro. And do me a favor. After you eat, take a shower. You smell. I think I will. You looked all right in there with Ray today. It's more tiring than it looks, huh? What's he after anyway? Making me fight. I just want to make him happy. Lots of luck to you. How can the history of the world be so fucking boring? And all those people are dead too. You still holding a grudge against me because of that Veronica thing? - If you are, I gotta tell you... - You were holding a grudge against me. I was pissed at you for stirring up shit. I guess I was an idiot. Shouldn't tell you who to hang out with, even if your friends are lame. I wanna hang out with you, but you never wanna hang out with me. Seems like you always got places to go. You gonna deny something's goin' on? - You're gonna laugh at me. - What? You're gonna think I'm full of shit. - Is it a guy? - No. - Is he at P.S. 20? - No, it's not a guy. Then what? I'm training to be a boxer. Oh, be serious! I am serious. I'm training with Hector Soto at the Brooklyn Athletic Club on Front Street. You mean, like pow-wow-wow? Oh, that's cool. You get hit? - In the face? - It happens. You fight guys? That's all there is right now. You got guys hitting you in the face? You don't understand, Marisol. It's like you're all you've got. You're all alone in there, you know? I can't explain it exactly. You are crazy. My crazy friend. It's fun, that's all. Doesn't sound like fun to me. Well, there is this one guy. I knew it. Name. Adrian. Adrian? What kind of girly name is that? Hey, hundred percent man, if you know what I mean? And? And what? - How do you know about this percentage? - Guesswork, Marisol. How come everything's gotta be a romance with you? I live for that shit. What can I say? Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We'll give you the formal introductions, if you don't mind. We'll give you the formal introductions, if you don't mind. Will all the boxers kindly turn in their passports? Will all boxers turn in their passports... over here at ringside? Piece of work, right? Who is he? Some hotshot promoter. Always got new flesh to peddle. - Come sit with us. - No, thanks. I got my chair over there. Thanks anyway. Don't feel social? I understand. Two, three, four, five. Break. Break. So you're becoming a serious fan? - I liked that guy Lopez. - Yeah. Garcia came back strong tonight. If my payday was as sweet as his, I'd come out fighting too. I bet you would. You think we could go get something to eat? I'm starved. I can't. Got a date with my wife tonight. I'll have a bacon cheeseburger. Make it a deluxe with extra bacon. Rare. What? I said I was hungry. And for you? A cup of soup, a garden salad with Italian dressing on the side. That's all. - What kind of dinner is that? - Trying to stay at my weight. Got a lot of speedy fighters in my division. - You compete? - Yeah. You like it? Sure. Keeps me out of trouble. You a delinquent? Not anymore. - How come you train with Hector? - You mean, like, at all? - Yeah. - Because I want to. - Aren't you afraid of gettin' hurt? - What, are you're not? No, it's just... It's a dangerous sport. I didn't make the cheerleading team. How long you train for? Almost a year. Cal's got a whole plan mapped out for me. I might be lined up with Ray in the next amateur heat. - Your favorite guy. - I hope you cream that asshole. He's not that bad. Yeah, just another harmless prick. You two are friends? I feel like I should lie and say no. Don't lie. We grew up in the same neighborhood. Yeah, he's cuckoo, he's fucked up. You know, he's harmless. Not everybody's blessed with brains and talent. So how come you didn't sit next to Hector like he asked you to? 'Cause I didn't feel like it. He thinks you're a good fighter. Hector got me started. Yeah? How come you still don't train with him? Because I'd be 50 before I got a pro fight with Hector. What's the sense in doing this if I'm not gonna make any money, right? I can't work for my father forever. My little brother, right out of school, he enlists in the marines. No, thank you. Besides, I don't think Hector believed in me. You wanna see where my mom was born? Right there, 37 years ago. You didn't have to walk me home. I don't mind. I mean, I can take care of myself, you know. I know. I wanted to. So what's it like in Gowanus? In places like this, no one matters. No one and nothing. That's not gonna be my life, man. I'm gonna turn pro, and I'm gonna move far away from here. Someplace where I'm not gonna get killed doing my laundry. Right. Or raped in your own fucking stairway. Shot for a pair of shoes. That girl who's been at the gym, all dolled up, watching you spar... Is she your girlfriend now? Karina? Sometimes. Oh, so she's your sometimes girlfriend. You know, it's cool between us. She's pretty. Yeah, she is. She's sweet on me, but it's like I don't have time to... - Be a Romeo? - Yeah. Half the time... I get a feeling that she only likes me 'cause I wanna go pro. You being exploited? I'm serious. She's gorgeous and all that, but it's like... sometimes we don't have much to say to each other, you know? Sounds like a dream date for most guys. Yeah, it is. Guess I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for anymore. Well, what do you want? Fuck if I know. Why'd you do that? I don't know. You taste sweet. Funny. I always thought of myself as salty. You're wrong. You're sweet. I gotta go. I'll talk to you soon, all right? Yeah. Yo, where are you going? That time of year again, ladies. Time for the Presidential Physical Fitness Exam. I don't give a shit what the president thinks of my physical fitness. A mile's not gonna kill any of ya. This year, ladies. Good work, Guzman. Looks like those hormone treatments really do the job. One more lap. She's got a good chin. I know. Hey, champion! What are you doing here? Hi. Nice seeing you. Ah, man, I just seen that guy fighting on TV yesterday. Good fight, champ. How you doin'? He popped you real good. I popped him back, didn't I? Well, you're getting the hang of this game. You gonna walk home? I'm taking off. My dad will give me grief if I keep coming home so late. Does he know? Know what? About this? Not unless he has binoculars this very second. So what exactly is this? Who knows? You still like me with my black eye? I think I like you more. Hi, Dad. You stole money from me. - I'm gonna pay you back. - Who's this guy you're running with? What the hell happened to you? Did he do this to you? Adrian? No. - How could you let him do this to you? - Get away from me. That's how it goes? You hook up with a creep who knocks you around? Right. You're so reformed now, you're giving me advice? - I won't let this happen to my daughter. - What's going on? - Go to your room. - You're not my mother. Get out of here, Tiny. I said get out of here! Don't you fucking touch him. You think Mom would give me the same wise advise? That's it. Give me back what you took, and if I catch you with this pendajo again... You'll what? Fucking kill me? That was fast. I ran. I can see that. My parents are light sleepers. So what happened? You think I could stay here tonight? Yeah. But no monkey business. I thought all guys jumped at this chance. I guess I'm not prime trim, huh? How'd you get so fucking crude? How'd you get so fucking polite? Shut up. So you're serious? Cal tod me to keep a lid on it until I fight Ray. You two are gonna go at it? It's just a preliminary. Amateur stuff. So that "no sex" shit is for real? It's for real. Let's sleep. Yeah, yeah. Are your parents still together? Not really. My mom died a long time ago. So what happened, if you don't mind? She killed herself. Man. I'm sorry. Yeah. Me too. Dream of me knocking Ray out in the third round. I already have. What? Can I come in? Yeah. I hear it's true, you got a lover. Oh, man. First comes love, then comes marriage. Sensitive. It's not funny. Look, I don't know how you pay Hector... and I don't think I wanna know. But Dad's wasting his money on me and, well... he won't know if you use it instead. What are you gonna be doing when you're supposed to be at the gym? I'm a geek. I'll do something constructive with my time. Thanks. Hi. You must be the new boxer. I'm Candice. Not bad for an old fart. - How are you doing? Happy birthday. - Thank you. I was just talking about you. I've come to defend myself. Hey, remember when I told you that girls can't be boxers? Yeah, I remember. Girls... Excuse me... Women have a lower center of gravity. Maybe they're more grounded once they build strength. It makes 'em a different kind of boxer. - Are you serious? - It's just a theory. The way to prove it is to get more women in that ring. One-twenty-six. Must be all that muscle you're building. - What division? - You're a featherweight. - You're not mingling. - Huh? This is a party. You should be dancin'. - I'm not much of a dancer. - Sure you are. I mean, you dance, right? - Hector says my footwork gets sloppy. - Looks okay to me. Let's box. Come on. No, bro, not in Hector's kitchen. But you're all serious and shit. Come on. Be a man. You know... they say love kills you in the ring. Hector, I gotta go. But you just got here. Sure you can't stay longer? No. It was better with the ice cream. How you feel? Tired. This is a waste of time. Look, Adrian's got a bout coming up. I don't mean to insult you... What's the big deal? There's no one near Adrian's weight to spar with today. Might as well give my gal a chance. I don't like it, Hector. Tell him to think of her as a warm-up. This equality crap has gone too far. - Should we just forget about it? - No. Just get rough on her in the first round and Hector will stop it real early. Go ahead. Come on. What'd I tell you? Hit me! Hit me already. I'm not gonna fight him if he doesn't hit me. Both of you, enough bullshit! Now box! You okay? Stay inside. I love you. I really do. Come on. I'm not running after you, if that's what you want. 'A gender-blind amateur boxing proposal... is a statewide initiative that responds to the ongoing demands... for officially sanctioned amateur matches... while also addressing the expanding presence of females in the sport. Male and female amateurs within the same weight class... are allowed to compete with each other in the ring. " Now that they're mixing up the guys with the girls... you could have a lot more opponents. They got you fighting this girl from Buffalo next week. And you can have a fight every week if you want. Hey, Vince. Long time no see. Let me get this straight. She's had three amateur matches and she's already turning pro? That's a little premature, don't you think? - Damn it! - Trainer says kid's got a high fever. Dead on his feet with strep throat. I'd fight that yellow kid with one arm. Missy from Buffalo's 33 years old and she can make some money as a pro. The fight's totally called off? Why bother with small-fry stuff when she can be on TV? Calm down. There'll be other matches. Not soon enough. It's a pathetic turnout, but I've gotta give these people their $10 worth. And half of my fighters haven't showed up. Come on, Ira. Let's just see this thing in action. All right. If it turns ugly, you can't say I didn't warn you. - Nervous? - No. All right. Remember, you're judged on points. Be aggressive and make legal punches. - Nervous? - No. Welcome to Brooklyn A. C... in cooperation with the New York Amateur Boxing Initiative. Let's welcome a new boxer into the ring. From Brooklyn, 18 years old, 125 pounds... Diana Guzman. Challenging Diana in the far corner, let's welcome Raymond Cortez... from Brooklyn, 19 years old... also 125 pounds. Both of these boxers' originally scheduled opponents... couldn't make their fights. And these kids wanna rumble. Let's give a big hand for their fighting spirit. You know the rules. Let's keep it above the belt. Fight a fair fight and good luck. Touch up. Stay loose and relaxed, okay? Box! Okay, off you go. Come on, Diana. Stop! Good. You're doing good. Relax. Hey, Sandro. How you been doing? I haven't seen you in a while. Keep your head on. She's getting a lot of good punches. At least he's predictable. And what's with all the wild swinging bullshit? He really wants to kill me. Okay, he's lunging at you thinking you're gonna back away from him. Use that to throw your body shots. Stay with him. Hey! You gotta box more, okay? Are you listening to me? Stay inside of him... boom, shoot an uppercut. I'll try. Box! All right, come on, Diana. Yeah, Diana, come on. Come on! Break! Stop! One, two... three, four... five, six... seven, eight... You okay? Box! - You don't have it in you. - Stop! No talking. Box! Stop! I don't have the stomach for this. What the hell are you doing, huh? Don't let him bully you like that. You are a better fighter than Ray. Come on! Box. Stop! That's below the belt. This is a warning. Box. Stop! - What a prick. - He can't do that, right? Last warning. One more time, you're disqualified. Box. What's below the belt anyway? Ain't nothing but a pussy! - Yeah, I wish I had thought of that. - Fucking asshole. What are you doing? Hey, I gotta warn you too. I'll say it one last time. - No pushing. - Catch you next time. Box! Stop! That's it, Cortez. It's over. Get out of the ring. The match is over. I've had it with you, kid. Ladies and gentlemen... in a unanimous decision, Ray Cortez is disqualified... and Diana Guzman... is declared the winner... of this preliminary featherweight match. All this sneaking around, and for what? To get the shit beaten out of you, that's what. Thanks a lot, Dad. But you know, it was almost like entertainment. Hey, I won tonight. You hear me? I won. What do you think about that? I think you're ridiculous. You're nothing but a street fighter. You looked like a loser in there. Everything I know about losing I learned from you, Dad. - I'm your father. - Yeah, some father you are. The only thing you had the heart to love you practically beat into a grave. - Shut up with that. - You just had to push her, didn't you? I mean it! Until she'd rather die than answer to you, huh? I said shut up with that! I could snap your neck right now if I felt like it. - I could kill you if I felt like it. - No, no, no. Please. Mom begged. Did you stop when she said please? - I can't remember. - Diana, stop it! You belong to me now. How does it feel to see so much of yourself so close? - How does it feel? - Diana, stop! Please, Diana, stop. Just stop. All these years, you just looked right through me. Look what the cat dragged in. - Who are they? - Those are Hector's kids. He doesn't see them too often. Never mind. Who was that? Nobody. Quit it. - Oh, please. - No, I'm serious. This athletic shit makes you, like, a class achiever. - You think so? - Yeah. Well, now that I got school all covered... I only have the world outside of these walls to fuck up. Damn, girl, that's grim. It's the truth. - Holy shit. - What? Ex-hundred percent man is to your left. Stop being so obvious. Damn, girl. - That's him with the forearms? - Yeah. Well, if he's such an ex, what's he doing here? I don't know. Maybe he's a glutton for punishment or something. A glutton for punishment, loca? - Yeah. - Shit, you better go over there. I heard you fought Ray. You're right. He's a fucking case. I feel pretty fucking stupid out here, waiting for school to be let out. Then don't. Right. So, where's your woman when she doesn't have her tongue in your ear? Or do you only bring her out for special occasions? I came here to say I'm sorry. Sorry for what, Adrian? Proving to your friends you can still snag the pretty girl? You got yourself a fuckin' trophy now. Bet it makes you feel real big inside, huh? I don't feel too big right now. As a matter of fact, I feel pretty fucking small around you. Must be nice. Yeah, well, it's not. You and me, we just met each other, right? We barely know each other. No problem. So, then leave. - Maybe I don't wanna leave. - Why? You're off the hook now, free to do whatever. That's not all I wanted to say. I told Karina it wasn't gonna work out with her. I told her I finally met somebody that... makes something happen for me. Just 'cause it's true doesn't mean I know what to do about it, okay? You got anything to say to that? So I'm someone, huh? Yeah, you are. I was wrong. There's more than one of you out there. And I hear she's good. She's a southpaw, and she's won most of her matches 'cause of it. These next couple of weeks I'm gonna train you so hard... you'll be wired like a machine. There's all kinds of fighters out there. The more versatile you are, the better prepared you are. You gotta learn how to manage your power, 'cause you got more of it... than people realize. How you gonna do that? First, you're gonna strengthen yourjab. Feels funny, right? Southpaw now. Okay? I'm Ricky. I'm Ricky. Come on. Good. Jab, jab. Very nice. Very clever. Girls, I want a good, clean fight. It's my decision if one of you needs a standing eight count. If you score a knockdown, go to the farthest neutral corner... and stay there. Don't come out until I tell you to resume fighting. Got it? Let's go. The key to this is not losing your cool. The judges are gonna give that to Stiles 'cause they see her hands moving. Remind them you're in there with her. That was nice. Okay, your punches are making contact. Your defense is strong. But you gotta stagger her. These judges won't give you any points if they can't see you slowing her down. Stop. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a split decision. Hill judges 29-27 for Guzman. Ferrara judges 29-27 for Stiles. Anderson judges 28-27 for Guzman. And the bout goes to Guzman. Based on the results of the preliminary matches... you've been advanced to the finals. Even though the first fight was stopped? Yep. You scored better than a lot of the kids in your division. That's great. So, uh, who's next? Come on, Cal. You saw her with Stiles. - What's going on here? - I'll tell you what. This rinky-dink operation... excuse my candor, Ira... let this goddamn gender-blind program get out of hand. You signed him up for it. Boys are different from girls. What's so wrong about saying it out loud? Boys are different from girls. No girl has what it takes to be a boxer. Neither do most boys. I'm gonna petition the fight. Oh, come on, you're the one always complaining... you can't get enough matches for your guys. Adrian's young. He works hard. He's a good-looking kid. Ayear from now I want him grooming for the pros. Then you're pushing him. You can't humiliate my guy like this! Ira, I need your support. File your protest, but don't ask me to get involved. I will say this. Let the boxers box, and that'll speak for itself. Unbelievable. Hector, if this happens... I'm telling Adrian no mercy. You understand? Yeah. So will she. This is crazy. And Cal's right. This fucks with my record. It's your amateur record. At least we got the same disadvantage: We know each other's habits. Fuck! Come on. Stiles makes fights, right? You said it yourself. You have lost your mind. I got it. I won't make my weight. - What? - I'll eat for a fucking change. I won't fight you, and that's it. - Who says you're the only one fighting? - I'm sorry, Diana. I haven't trained all this time to be stuck in a ring with a girl. - Stuck with a girl. - Okay. Stuck with you. - You're afraid I might win. - No. You're gonna play it all manly and protective on me now. Look, I'm just being honest. - You're just like any other guy. - Oh, yeah? What kind of a guy goes around beating up a girl that... That he what? What? Just forget it. It's not right. Fine. All I know... is if you don't fight me in this match... you're less of a man than you think you are. What is it that you want from me anyway? You want me to take you a little more seriously, huh? Is that what you want? Is that your idea of Prince Charming? You need to take yourself a little more seriously. Who's the one who said it was all about the challenge? Who's the one who said that they love to win? Well, I'm not gonna love winning this one. Then maybe you shouldn't be a boxer. Oh, say can you see By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming And the rockets'red glare The bombs bursting in air Oh, I'm sorry. This seat is saved for someone. That our flag was still there You know what? Forget it. They're not coming. Oh, say does that star-spangled - The card says Diana Guzman. Look. - Must be a misprint. It doesn't look like a misprint to me. O'er the land of the free And the home Of the brave How you feeling? Like I got nothing to lose. Good, then. Inside, you know him? - Yeah. - How's he fight? He's always stepping left. He relies on his right for power. He jabs low, and his right cross can knock me out. Inside, you know yourself? Yeah, I do. Then that's all you need. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen... Welcome, ladies and gentlemen... to history in the making. New York's first gender-blind amateur boxing finals. In the gold shorts... weighing in at 125 pounds... Lead him with your jab. Keep moving to your left. Force him to come to you. And in the lovely purple shorts... - I can't go through with this, Cal. - Yes, you can. Just do some damage in this round and it will be short and sweet. Ladies and gentlemen, clap your hands for... Diana Guzman. Box! Pick up the pace, okay? - You're doing good by leading him. - I got to get to his body more. So she's got some defensive skills. So what? Take her out and finish her. Give me. Box! His jabs are getting low and his swings are wild. That leaves him open. Work your way inside and go for his brain every chance you get. I don't care who this guy is to you. Don't be afraid to hurt him. Get up, get up, get up! Boxers, center of the ring, please. Ladies and gentlemen... we have a unanimous decision. The amateur featherweight champ in these finals is... Diana Guzman! Yeah! Satisfied? In all my life, I never been so proud. Never. Let's go. You got a deadly hook. Someone really worked you over. Your right cross is no powder puff. I gave you everything I had. Me too. Boxing, going pro... I want it to be my ticket out. But I gave you an opening. It was stupid. But that's what happens. You just take advantage. Yeah. So, now I lose your respect, huh? No. After the other night? Come on. You boxed with me like I was any other guy. You threw down and you showed me respect. Don't you see what that means? That life with you is war. Maybe. Maybe life's just war, period. You said it. My life's been a mess since I met you. So, you gonna dump me now? Probably. Promise?
