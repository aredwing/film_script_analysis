You hit him first. - I would not smoke in fights. - It was not a fight. - Drink, I'll give you the better. - It was too wild. It was too wild. You will never forget this evening. Or me, Vince and Violet. Although you never see us again, you will never forget us. I think that's crazy. I think on something like that all the time. Yes! Give him a "Yes!" I just wanna go home. I'll get some painkillers. I have an entire pharmacy here. My brother is actually pharmacies. - Give it, Vince. - He must owe you one. - Yes. I can send you pictures. I'll get something to wash with. Okay. That he is not too crazy about. - Come on, it'll be fun. - Okay. I'll get some novelties. - You know how to party. - Yes, is not it? - It's a whole gear box. - You can catch fish with this. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Thank you for your help. I'll be careful. Have you broken something before? Only the foot. I made a silly skateboard trick. - How does it feel? - I can not really remember it. When I was little, I looked at it when the big skated. Okay? I was a little in love in one of the boys. He was a little wilder than the others and... ... one day he tried with a trick. They had built a jump and he took off on. There was a car around the corner. I did not see it happen, but I heard it. Sound when it hit him. It was weird. It sounded like... ... Branches knkker. It sounded as if he were made of wood. The first thing they see, do that... - Go ahead. So do the trick. - What is it? - Something painkillers, I think. It comes from a pharmacy, so it'll be fine. It's okay. Okay, let's go. I want to show you something. Come on, Craig. Did she patched up together? Fed views, right? I also somewhere in Palas Verdes - and an apartment in Malibu, but this is Violets vrk. I gave her checkhftet and said: "cabinet, whatever you want" - - and she has done so. She has decorated each one millimeter. What? What the hell? Fuck you! Craig, wait! Come here. Wait! - You too fucking me? - Take it easy. - You had too made it to 300 - Okay, do you think that? I want to rob them. The idiot has a safes full of cash. I nails them. Are you crazy, you fucking monkey? I just want out of here. He has $ 150,000 in cash. It's nothing for him but for us it is a whole new life. Think about it. - I do not know. - Okay, but you do need money. - Now you have the opportunity. - The possibility of being arrested. - He has seen our faces. - He do not call the cops. - What a crazy assumption. - Not if you're thinking after. If they see his forstrrede pupils he goes in with us. He do not call the cops. I'll do it in any circumstances. If you do not want to be with then slipped on, man. Wait, wait, wait. What should I do? - Take the girl, so I'll handle the rest. - You're doing it well no? - Player In the off on each other? - Why would you look at? No one is injured. Take Violet and hold on tight. - You become good friends again? - Yes. Violet has all his music coupled to anlgget. 12,000 slices on shuffle. Games maniacal instrumental number it with the guitars. Or this one, to better suit mood. Here's your cocktail. Are you done on the ladies' room? I have to pee. You, Colin. I do not want do this, but... - I want my money in the safe. - This is really stupid. We wait here, Craig pick them up. What is the code? - I do not know. - Do not fuck with me. - Safely. We're doing a good party. - Tell me the code. I can not. It's not locked, Vince. - Should I believe this? - I can not remember the numbers. It was her birthday, but so I switched it out. It is unlocked. - It's full of cash. - I rely too much on friends. Craig, take care of this. - Sit down. - What do I do with her? - Put her there. - Careful. Sit down. - Do not do anything stupid. Okay. Why lock the you do not know, idiot? - Come on! - Holy shit. - Why does it take so long? I come! Come on, I have them. - How much is it? - I counted them. Come on. - I too use the car keys. - They're over there on the shelf. - Relax, damn it! - This was not my idea. It was his. I said it was stupid. Shut up. Do we turn the clock back. Do you like it? Should we pretend about? Do you find it? Well, Vince. We can pretend that the last district has not taken place? - We tried the to rob you. - Yes, it was really stupid. We have not been completely honest, but let's forget this. Okay. We did not try to rob you. I threatened you not just with a knife. Delete it, I said. It does not exist. It belong to the past, we live in moment. It does not exist. We start over and reset it all. That's fine with me. - What about you? - Okay. Good. Then we start all over again. - You do not call the cops? - No, on resord. - What the hell is going on? - The Violets birthday. What should I give her? She everything. She can buy exactly what she wants. You gotta think outside the box. We got an idea for a wild night. I find a few losers and give them money to humiliate himself. - What a wonderful evening. Congratulations. - No, you're too fat. We had fun us. It's been fantastic. It's more like a reality show. - What program? - Like when they'll eat animal dicks. Stopping head down to hoses or'll eat bugs. But it's not TV. And then it say 250,000 tax dollars at stake. - 2 .. $ 250,000? - What? - Are they for us? - Ned. - Down, dammit. Stay right there, Vince. - I lie down. Okay. It's okay. I have to win them. This is for fun. The money in the closet was to the game. We would give them to you and you took them. It is... There is a word for it. - Irony? - Thank you. It's super-irony. - What do we do? - What we are saying. So I do not call the cops? Whether we call the cops? Hell. - And we can go when we want? - That would be sad. It would really be sad, but you can go, when you want. But I'll give ye not them here. Okay. But no matter how much money is is, I suck it of him. None guys to take care of each other or suck on each other. I have to do as we say, but not like that. Okay. So what do we do? Okay, here we go again! Good decision. $ 500 to the person who holds his breath lngst. Is it just that? Okay, I'm ready. - Are you ready? - Yes, I'm ready. - Should I just hold your breath? - Yes, any more than he. - I begin! -Do you take time? - Yeah, are you ready?

Do you see the house over there? Their dog shit always over here. I should talk to the gardener the other day and fouled up in a shit. I had brand new shoes on. They were totally ruined. - Okay, and? - I want revenge on the neighbors. 800 to that shit inside their house. Photo Proof takes. - This is insane. - 1200 is my final offer. Okay, I'm ready. I like that. Your rabble. Craig, you will surely not do this? No, I do not know but I'm doing it for my family. That's intrusion. It gives at least two years in the shade.

So no, I'm not out trays. "Keep the girl, so I'll handle the rest." It was your only instruction. I have done time before. I can handle it. But you? It's just what I say. Damn. Yes! Good luck!

I know you. - I know you too, Craig. - I'm not like that anymore. I have a responsibility. I have a life. The air you're pulling, going to waste. You're a fucking loser, Vince. I know. I know that I'm a loser. I've always known but you surprise me, Craig. Your parents love you and took care of you. They sent you to college. See how it's been you.

How's the offer? $ 50,000 to the First there eating his portion. $ 50,000, it is well more than a rsln for you? Consider it. A lot of concerns disappears. The bills can be paid. I can do just what you want. This is pure psychology. It can easily get over. Okay, dammit. I see. - Here's your. - I'm with. Beautiful. Wait a minute. I do not trust him. Whoever eats First up, gets 50,000. What's up, guys? What are you waiting for? Eat. - I'm done! - Done! - Fuck, that was close. Violet? - No, I won clearly. - Open the mouth! - It's open! Fuck.

Craig, get your 50,000. I trust you, TCL them. I'm talking with a friend. 20 minutes. Hell, Vince. It was too funny. Craig, let's go. It was freezing. Absolutely freezing. Hello. Whoever cleanup, we talked about... It is needed now. It was good to celebrate with you, Craig. You made the right choice. I thought my guy would handle it. It's okay.
