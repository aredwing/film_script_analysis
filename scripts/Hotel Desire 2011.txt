A cloudless sky, and yet it will rain. - Mom, we have to go. - What time is it? - Take your toothbrush out first. - What time is it? - Nine-thirty, Mom. - What time does the bus leave? Ten to ten. In twenty minutes. Red. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. You promised me, Mom. I don't want you to get cancer. - How do you know what cancer is? - Internet. Oh, Luca. Green. - Where did I leave the key? - In the car, Mom. - Shit. - Mom. - What is it? -Don't use bad words. I'm sorry. Wait. Luca, what am I going to do without you? You'll be fine, Mom. It's only for two weeks. - Promise? - Of course. - Here you go, young man. A cap. - Thank you. You're welcome...Luca. - Where are you going, Luca? - To my Dad. He'll pick me up in Paris and take me to the Coated Sewer. - You're going to the Cote d'Azur. - To the Cote d'Azur. - Right. Know what that means? - No. - The azure-blue coast. - Wow. - That's right. Let's go. - Azure blue is a very deep blue. - Isn't that right, Mom? - Absolutely. Luca, don't forget to catch that butterfly for me. - I promise. - I love you. I love you too. - Say hello to Dad. - I will. - Don't smoke or it will start raining. - I promise. So Julius Pass paints portraits of people without seeing them? Correct. He uses his sense of touch, exploring their features with his hands. - Amazing. - And today his exhibition opens... Cappuccino for the gentleman, fresh orange juice for the lady. Very well. Have a good day. - Toni, are you crazy? - I'm sorry, Felix, but I'm late. - Can you park it for me? - Having your period? - Please, the key's inside. - It's the last time. They'll... Please. Hotel Mira Mare Berlin, Ostrowski. How can I help you? Of course, Mr Rubinstein. - Wild boar, service please. - Caramelized mango for table 26. - Has anyone seen Antonia yet? - No In-Room Dining, Zylinski. How can I help you? English breakfast for 406. - Suse, have you seen Antonia yet? - No. Have you seen Antonia today? Must be Groundhog Day. That's why a well-managed hotel should only hire homosexuals. Because I can't get children and use them as an excuse to mess things up. - Marcel, I... - No, Antonia, it's enough. After hearing me rave about my unfulfillable wish for a child... you ought to know I can't accept this drivel. I just can't. Okay, you're a single mother and you work at this hotel. So? Does that keep you from getting up, bringing your son to the bus... and showing up for work on time? No. Heavens, Toni. If I had what you had, I'd work even longer and get up earlier. I know, Marcel. That's why it makes me... Yes, I know. That's why it makes you feel even worse. I know, I know. Now for the last time I'll do my duty as caring gay maitre d'hotel and say: Let's forget it. - You're the best. - You'll be fired if it happens again. - This is the very last time. - Thank you. And yet you still look like seven days of rain. I wouldn't mind a downpour to wash the dust off the streets. Of course. Now slip out of your pitifully drab everyday clothes... and slip on your fairy tale costume, Cinderella. - Thank you. - Go on. Hey, Antonia. - My feet really hurt. - Hello, Julia. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing, I'm fine. - I'm just sweating, that's all. - You're sweating? What are you talking about? What's the matter? What is it? Antonia, come here. What's wrong? What happened? I sweat, and I don't think that's sweat coming out of your eyes. As surely as you menstruate every month, that's not sweat. - You're crazy. - And you're smiling. - Sweetheart, what happened? - I hate myself for it. - It's so ridiculous. It... - I knew it was about a man. - The moment I came in... - No. It's not about a man. The only man... He's not a man, he's my son. - Luca? - Yes, Luca. He's in France with his Dad. - I can't believe you gave in to her. - I'm sorry. Hello, Director. Ostrowski, from the reception. - Really? - Yes. I'd have been worried to death. I mean, he's only seven. - An independent young man. - He really is very independent. You know, for the first time in ages I can just feel that I... I have... What? Since Luca's father... Since Luca's father? - Don't laugh at me. - I'm not laughing at you. Go on. It's been seven years since I... - ...last made love. - I can't believe it - Seven years? Really? - Yes. Toni, why didn't you tell me? That can be arranged. - Sweet of you. What can be arranged? - Dates. - I don't have time for such things. - For such things? Listen to you. You also have to think of yourself. - As of now, you'll start doing so. - Doing what? Lightness. Just take things lightly, and take some risks. Let him bring you to bed. Maybe he'll sing to you. Who? Who is going to sing to me? Well, other men. They really exist. I've seen them. But men aren't interested in me. A woman with a child makes men blind to her. Antonia, beauty can't be blemished. And if Luca looks anything like you... he must be a gorgeous boy and not a blemish. - I've never looked at it... - Lightness, Antonia, lightness. And now I'm going to shower. My body is all sticky. Bye, Antonia. Such a beautiful name. Much cooler than 'Toni'. Thank you. Is that her? Ms Marin, do you understand what it's about? Mr Zylinski told us he ordered you to restock the multipurpose wipes. - Is that true? - Yes, Director. But when you went to the storeroom, there were none left. - Correct. - So I asked her to call. Mr Zylinski, let Ms Marin continue. And stop those conspiring glances. - Director, it's obvious... - Give Ms Marin a chance to speak. I called our supplier, as we need the multipurpose wipes for housekeeping. - And... - And no one answered the phone. Ms Marin, your effort is laudable, but the execution is unacceptable. - It's a ground for dismissal. - I know. I'm really very sorry. - How long have you been in service? - Since the opening. Five years. In order for those five years to become many more... we expect top performances from everybody. Why is that? Because our guests expect top service from us. The next time you race across the city... to find...what was it again? -Multi-purpose wipes. To find multi-purpose wipes, take the time... to drive to the service entrance and don't park in front. And don't keep Mr... -Jedinger. And don't keep Mr Jedinger from welcoming our guests. - Yes, Director. - We'll leave it at a verbal warning. If it wasn't for Mr Zylinksi, you might have to work at those awful hostels... those hostels popping up all over the city. Eight-bed rooms, imagine. Who are those people? Eight beds. - Terrible. - Yes. Good, that's been settled. Mr Zylinski, have a good day. - I'm glad we resolved this. - So am I, Director. - Ms Marin. - Director. - Mr Richter. - Ostrowski. Forgive me. Mr Jedinger. - Go back to your desk, you weasel. - This will have consequences. For your ass for sure, if we happen to meet at the shower one fine day. - I'm sorry, Toni. - I'm sorry, Felix, it's all my fault. You see, sweetheart, everything's fine again. - Cigarette? - I quit smoking. That's good news. - I'd better get started. - The list is on the board. Don't smoke or it will start raining. Let Ms Marin continue. And stop those conspiring glances. Lightness, Antonia, lightness. Yes, Marcel? Room service. No, listen, I won't discuss it any further. I selected 15 English-speaking nude models from your database. I don't care. Be glad Kilian Kerner isn't here to witness this screw-up. I want you to suggest a way to solve the problem right now. If I don't hear from you in five minutes, I won't use your services again. Housekeeping. Shit. Man, Dennewitz. No, hold on. No, I'm already at the elevator. I just pressed the elevator button. Yes, of course I'm dressed up. Yes, perfect. Of course I'm excited. Yes, this will be my day, absolutely. How do you manage to get all those intellectuals from TV in your gallery? Electric blankets. I'm taking a taxi. I'm in the elevator now. I have a very bad... Hello? light gray pink Definitely not. dark grey Excuse me, please. Let me tell you that you're all full of shit. 'Julius, you can't say that.' No? 'No, no.' You're right, Dennewitz. It's an honour and a great joy... to waste my time on you today. 'Julius.' I mean spend, spend. It's so hot, I could use a refreshment. How about you? 'Yes, yes.' Here, champagne for everyone. 'Yes, champagne. Wow, wonderful.' 'How do you like it?' 'Oh, I'm glad to hear that.' 'Those works have such power, and that even though he's blind.' 'No, because he's blind.' 'Amazing, incredible.' Cunts. Don't stop. Do you see my cigarettes anywhere? Yes, over here. Smoking isn't allowed here. - Sorry, would you like one as well? - I quit smoking.
