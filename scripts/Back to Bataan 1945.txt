Come on, guys! Come on, fellows, get to the main gate. Get to the main gate, boys. Hurry up. Come on, fellows. Go the main gate, will you? Come on, the main gate. Right this way. Come on, boys. Get over to the main gate. - Hurry up! - Get to the main gate, fellows. Keep the men under cover. Come on. - Here they come, Captain. - Hurry. Come on, men. Hurry it up. Keep moving, men. Hurry it up. Come on. Hurry it up. We'll send a man back as soon as we're in the clear. - Okay, Captain. We'll take care of them. - Right. Come on, give that man a hand, will you? - That's the first round. - They'll be back. - Captain. - Yeah? - It's all clear, you can withdraw now. - Good. - Jack. - Yes, sir? We're pulling out. Come on. The men you are about to see... are actual survivors of three terrible years... in the Jap prison camp at Cabanatuan. For two weeks, Filipino troops have held their front on Bataan without relief. And for 10 days and 10 nights, they have been withstanding the unceasing attacks... of Gen. Homma 's 200,000 men. Don't we know it? Why do you fight? This is not your war. America brought you into it. For every American who dies on Bataan, seven Filipinos shed their blood. America has abandoned you. General, what do you think our chances are that... That help is on its way? Nothing we can bet on. What good is liberty to the dead? Filipinos, why do you fight? Look toward the sea. Your liberators come to restore your homes and your loved ones. Filipinos, look toward the sea. Scotty, any word on the concentration on our left? Nothing to indicate one. But there's time for aerial reconnaissance before dark. Yes, we got time, all right. But no air corps. It burned out a bearing. - Get Col. Madden. - Yes, sir. Filipinos, why are you rotting in foxholes? You have no arms. You're dying by the thousands of malaria. - Your homes are being destroyed. - Col. Madden. - Headquarters on the phone. - Lay down your guns. Spare your homeland. Col. Madden speaking. They're attacking about every hour, sir, as usual. Joe, something may be pulled against your end of the line. Put that company of Philippine Scouts on alert... but don't commit them to action unless the situation becomes desperate. - What's up, sir? - I wish I knew, Joe. - Where's Capt. Bonifacio? - He went to the cliffs, sir. - Colonel, sir. - Yes? That woman on the radio, she was his sweetheart, sir. I know. - Roberts. - Yes, sir. I'm going to the cliffs. I'll be gone 10 minutes. - Take over. - Yes, sir. Hello, Andrs. - Just passing by, I suppose. - No, I want to talk to you. Won't you make yourself at home? - Cigarette? - Thanks. I'm sorry I can't offer anything better than these crude native cigarettes. That's all right. I've been smoking them for years. - Find them to my taste. - Good. You'll forgive me if I don't pour you a martini... - Stop acting like a schoolboy. - What do you mean schoolboy? Only a schoolboy would expose himself and his men like you did today. I know it's tough when the woman you love goes over to the enemy... - but you can't let... - It's none of your business. That's right. But risking the lives of these men is my business. Keep it up and you'll have the whole company wiped out. This is a dirty war we're fighting. We've got to fight it the right way. - What do you want me to do? - I want you to act like a soldier. Remember you're in command of a company of men. You've got the responsibility of their lives in your hands. What is it, Bernessa? Maj. McKinley, sir, battalion reports. Japs are making mass attack, sir. Get back to your company. Hold them on the alert. And don't do anything until you get orders, understand? Yes, sir. By the way, for this morning's action, I'm recommending you for the DSC. - Colonel, sir. - Yes, Bernessa? Capt. Bonifacio, how is it with him? - Okay. We'll have to keep an eye on him. - Yes, sir. Get McKinley on the wire. How much ammunition do they think we've got? Maj. McKinley speaking. Madden speaking. What are you guys celebrating down there, New Year's? - That's real ammunition you're shooting. - That's real Japs we're shooting at. At the rate you're going, you'll use up our nine-day supply in two hours. They're not coming over at the usual rate. They're coming in waves. McKinley, there aren't that many Japs. Sir, I suggest you come down and see for yourself. - Take over, Roberts. - Yes, sir. I am going to see for myself. See what I mean, sir? They're actually bridging that barbed wire with their bodies. A bridge of dead. - Are you all right, sir? - I'm all right. Didn't know there were that many Japs. - Where's McKinley? - Second one got him, sir. Let's get out of here! - How goes it, Felipe? - Okay, Colonel. Filipinos. This is your countrywoman Dolici Dalgado speaking to you. I speak to you from my heart. Must America have the last drop of your blood? Lay down your guns. The empire of Japan is waiting to welcome you in... Take it easy! We don't have ammunition to waste on loudspeakers. Get down. Peace, prosperity, and freedom await you as soon as this war ends. You must not fight. The odds are against you. ... send more men than... - Hello, Carlito. - Hello, Colonel. ... preparing for this war for years. They have not yet been... - How's the arm? - Okay, Colonel, sir. Take care of it. I'm keeping an eye on your guitar. Thank you, sir. The army of Gen. Homma will join the battle in Bataan. Filipinos, there is no honor in this fight... What do they call that DSC you're getting for today's action? I'll trade you that medal for one shot at the loudspeaker. No deal. Can't always do what we like. I've got orders to report to Corregidor. - What for? - I don't know. I'm to turn over my command to Col. Roberts. - Can I go with you? - We lost Maj. McKinley today. You'll take over his battalion. We must work with them. We must show that we are worthy of their help. We must stop this senseless war at once. - Hi, Colonel. - Did the chow get here? - Yes, sir, Colonel. - Good. Andrs... I know every man in this outfit by his first name. - I've known them since they were kids. - Don't worry about them, Colonel. You have your lives and your honor. Filipinos, lay down your arms. - Col. Madden reporting, sir. - Colonel. - Hello, Joe. - Hello, Skinny. It's good to see you. - Have a seat. - Thank you. - We're gonna make fast talk. - Where's Gen. MacArthur? How are things going down at your end of the line, Joe? We could use a little more food. We're running out of horses and mules, but we'll get by. Sure you will. - American. - The last. You're building me up for something, Skinny. - Let's have it. - You're going out, Joe. - Where? - To organize general guerrilla resistance. And leave my Scouts? You can't do that to me, Skinny. I've spent most of my life... The President just ordered Gen. MacArthur to Australia. Well, then, I guess I can leave the Scouts. I don't have to tell you what the boys of Bataan have gone through. They've been bothered especially with planes. They've pinned us down until we're helpless. We've been combing them out of our hair. Anything you can do to relieve the pressure. We'll do the best we can. - Haven't got much time. - What about men? You'll have to take pot luck. There're a few men in the hills already. A scattering of scouts and Philippine troops who were cut off. ROTC boys we couldn't equip, and a few civilians. Here's a map reference to a small group near the town of Balintawak. You'll leave by PT boat at midnight. That doesn't give me time to get back to my men, does it? No, it doesn't. - I have my sergeant with me... - Sure, take him along. And one thing more. You have a source of information you'll have to guard at all costs. - It comes over Radio Manila. - Radio Manila? Yes, it's the girl, Dolici Dalgado. I know the stuff she's broadcast is poison, but it would've gone on the air anyhow. - She's doing more harm than Jap guns. - Harm? It was a tip from her that kept your reserve company of scouts... out of action and saved the whole front. Last night, she warned us about Yamashita's arrival. - That'll be good news to a friend of hers. - Joe... nobody knows about this except you and me... now that Gen. MacArthur's gone. - It'll have to stop there. - Yes, sir. And the way to make contact with her is set out in your orders. It's vital that the guerrilla movement be organized in case... You won't have any trouble. - They're a great people. - They are, sir. - So long. - So long, Skinny. Be seeing you. To His Excellency, Gen. Homma, soon to be conqueror of Bataan. Thank you. If the Chief of Intelligence can spare his beautiful companion for a moment... I will talk with her. I have heard you on the radio, Miss Dalgado. I am deeply impressed by your good sense. Thank you, Your Excellency. You may be the instrument... of sparing your people much unpleasantness. - I have worked hard for that end. - You must continue. The liberation of the entire Philippines is now merely a matter of days. - Let us hope so. - In all confidence, Miss Dalgado... we Japanese look upon you Filipinos... as nephews and nieces. You have been out of our East Asia family for too long. We are waiting to embrace you, to welcome you back into the fold... providing you behave yourselves. - We shall be very good, Your Excellency. - I'm certain you will. But remember, we are kindly... but not indulgent. We shall not hesitate to spank the unruly ones. Thank you, Miss Dalgado. The third, or American period of occupation... began with the Battle of Manila Bay... and will be terminated by a grant of independence... July 4, 1946. These are the main phases of our history. What, then, was Spain's contribution to the Philippines? Maria? The Spanish brought us the holy faith, the Blessed Virgin, and the saints. Quite right, Maria. The Spaniards brought us Christianity. And, now, what would you say America gave the Philippines? - Soda pop. - Hot dogs! - Movies. - Radio. Baseball! Perhaps the first of my pupils has a better answer. Senor Bello. America taught us that men are free, or they are nothing. Since then, we have walked with high heads among all men. Thank you, Senor Bello. At first, Filipinos did not feel that way. They resisted the American occupation. And then what happened? Theresa? - We were beaten. - We were not. Americans cannot beat Filipinos. My brother, Ramon licked every American in the USA... at 118 pounds. Facts, Maximo. We must stick to facts. I seem to recall that Ramon lost his fight for the championship. We was robbed. Perhaps, Maximo, I should ask you about a Filipino who was not beaten. What were the last words of Gen. Del Pilar... to those who left him behind? "I am..." "I am surrounded by fearful odds... "that will overcome me and my gallant men. "But I am well pleased with the thought... "that I die fighting for my beloved country. "Go you into the hills and defend it to the death." - Is this everybody? - Yes, sir. I was told I'd find some Philippine Scouts among you. Cpl. Cruz, 26th Cavalry, Philippine Scouts, reporting, sir. Good, Corporal. Anyone else? - Where are you men from? - Mostly from Balintawak, sir. Ever handle guns? - Just bolos? - Our fathers used them well. How well I know. I guess you understand we're taking on a job that would be tough for trained men. We're gonna blow up a gasoline dump on a Japanese airfield... 50 miles the other side of Balintawak. There will be from 400 to 500 Japs on the field. - How many? - 400 or 500. A mere trifle, like we say. We'll start tonight after dark. That ought to put us at the airfield by dark tomorrow night. Between now and sundown, Sgt. Bernessa will give you instructions. Listen to him carefully and do exactly as he says. - Take over, Sergeant. - Yes, sir. Things look rough? A little rough. In that case, smell this stew. Go ahead, smell it. Ever smell anything better than that in your life? Never. In that case, taste it. Why, it's a masterpiece, Bindle. You taste there the fruits of two days' panhandling. All of which goes to prove that nothing is wasted. People could look at me and say, "Bindle Jackson, hobo." But without 20 years' experience on the road, could I make up a mulligan like that? - Never. - Now, if I could only shoot. Colonel, strictly from a point of view of scientific curiosity... what would you say our chances are? - Of blowing up the dump or getting back? - Both, especially the latter. - Fair. - Fair? You wouldn't say good? Not if you want me to tell you what I think. Very interesting, isn't it? Not, come to think about it, that I have any seriously pressing engagements. - Colonel, did you have a good life? - Fine life, Bindle. Especially here on the islands. - And you? - I can't complain. You know, that's the worst part about war. You meet somebody, you get to know them... wham, you never see them again. You see something, but you never know how it ends. Be nice to know right now how all this is going to end, wouldn't it? It certainly would. You will bow to the Japanese officer as representative of His lmperial Majesty! Lower! Fellow Orientals, the hand of His lmperial Majesty, the Emperor... has put an end to your domination... by an exploiting and arrogant American race. It will next put an end to a system of education... designed to impress upon you a sense of inferiority. Senor Bello... step forward, please. As principal of this school, you will haul down the flag. Unless you haul down the flag, you will hang in its place. You contempt... - For the last time, Senor Bello. - Senor Bello, haul down the flag. I speak to you in the name of every man, woman, and child in the United States. - All right, Bernessa. - Yes, sir? - Let's get under way. - Yes, sir. Break it up. He was so little. Not a healthy child. He hated Americans because his father had fought with Aguinaldo. It is Miss Barnes. I gave him an apple. It was the first he'd ever seen. And then we became friends. - Here, lady, you'd better sit down. - No. - What happened? - The Japs came into Balintawak. He was not a brave man. He was too terrified even to speak. But when they ordered him to haul down our flag... he could only shake his head. And then they hanged him... in the schoolyard, in the presence of his pupils. It was a bad thing to look at. I am Miss Barnes, schoolteacher. - Who are you and what is your rank? - Col. Madden, ma'am. Colonel, is it? Then I'm sure you'll know what must be done. When you attack the village, I want you to attend especially to the Japanese Captain. - It was he who gave the order. - We're not attacking the village. You're an American, are you not? It was your flag he refused to lower, not his. The village isn't much out of our way. Our only chance of getting to the gasoline dump is by surprise. - Yes, but... - The moment we'd attack that village... the whole countryside would be on the alert. I'm thinking of 70,000 men on Bataan. How do you fellows feel about it? We think you're right. Are you proposing to leave this crime unavenged? We fight for the Philippines, not for revenge. - Bernessa? - Yes, sir? - We're moving out immediately. - Yes, sir. You stay here with Miss Barnes. You'll find food and blankets in the lean-to. - Take good care of her till we get back. - Take care of her, indeed. - Do you think I'd stay here for a moment? - You can't go back to the village. Furthermore, young man, I am not accustomed... to being ordered about by every young popinjay in uniform. - The men are ready, sir. - Goodbye, Miss Barnes. Colonel... you really are not returning to the village? Really not. Then I shall give you Buenaventura Bello's epitaph. Someday you may come back into the village of Balintawak again... and put it over his grave. "The place matters not- cypress or laurel or lily white "Scaffold or open plain "combat or martyrdom's plight" Those words were written by Jos Rizal, the Philippines' greatest hero... on the night before he was executed by the Spaniards. Remember those words. Carry them in your heart... so that wherever men fight for freedom, there it may be said: "Here lies Buenaventura Bello... "schoolteacher of Balintawak." - Colonel? - Yes? What would you think our chances are now? - Good. - Funny thing. So would I. Hold it up. There's Mt. Mariveles ahead. We ought to be about two hours from the airfield. We better split up. Check your watch. - That is Mt. Mariveles, isn't it? - Yes, sir. We should be hearing gunfire from Bataan. Yes, sir. - Cruz? - Yes, sir. Hold this group here, and keep them under cover. Bring along four men. We'll take a look-see. Scouts. Give me a hand. - Bernessa. - Yes, sir? - Post some guards. - Yes, sir. - What happened? - Bataan has fallen. Seventy thousand men. How could it happen? - We're beaten. - The Japs have beaten us. Hunger and sickness beat us, not the Japs. Then why didn't America send food and medicine? Why didn't America help? Maybe you can still get away, sir. There is no more army here. Now the fighting will be done in Australia. Maybe there will be fighting here. - Maybe the people will wanna fight. - Sure. The people will fight. Against thousands of Japs, after they've beaten our armies? We have fought that way before. We've never been conquered. With bolos against machine guns? If a schoolteacher can die for the American flag... we can fight for the Philippines. We must have a hope. We cannot die for nothing. You remember the name Andrs Bonifacio? Every Filipino does. If he were alive and sent out a call, would the people answer? - Bonifacio's dead. - But his grandson is alive... among those prisoners. Maybe we'll be able to find him, sir. For you, Captain. - All right, set him down. - Don't. Take him into the lean-to. Put him down carefully. He's a very sick man. Which one of you men calls himself the cook? - Me. - I shall want some hot water first. Then some clear broth. Do you know how to make it? Don't pretend you do if you don't. Good. Hurry off. Maximo, get these men some water. - Can't you see they're thirsty? - Yes, ma'am. Cook, that's a petticoat you're gaping at. You've seen a petticoat before. - Yes, but not lately. - Hurry with the broth. - Who is he? - He's the grandson of Andrs Bonifacio. No wonder you carried him so carefully. Those men are waiting for you. - Where are you from? - From the north. Lingayen. - I've come to fight. - We come from Batangas. - We've come to fight, too. - Good. Plenty of fighting to be done. - Do you bring any news? - They say the Japs have taken Bataan. - I know. How about Corregidor? - They don't say about Corregidor. You men can do the most good if you go back to your barrios... and tell them that the war hasn't ended yet. And now the people must fight. We need men. We have no arms. - Where did you get this? - Killed a Jap. Kill more Japs and get more guns. When you have men and arms, send your leaders to me. You'll know where we are. Good luck. - Thank you. - Be careful. We'll drive all the Japs out. We'll chase them out of Balintawak. Sure you will, Maximo. Hurry to the village and try to find eggs. Don't forget those papers. Hurry now. You know what this will mean for the people? Reprisals and terror. It's always been an all-out war. Now there's no pretense about it. You can't inflict this on them. They've suffered too much. I'm gonna make arrangements for you to leave the island. Leave? You can't ask me to leave. My children are here, my work. Do you know what they do to guerrillas? If Filipino women can endure it, I can. - No, I'm afraid... - Besides... you need someone to nurse him. At least until he's better. We'll see. - You spoke of an epitaph for Senor Bello. - Yes, I did. Get it ready. We're going into Balintawak tonight. Col. Roberts? Last time I saw him he was still alive. How about Delfonso? He was in pretty bad shape. He's still going. There was a rumor about taking our entire outfit to the same prison camp. - You haven't eaten a thing. - Sorry, ma'am, I'm not hungry. You can't get your strength back if you don't eat something. Here's some real chicken broth. If you knew the trouble we went... Sorry, ma'am. I don't know what I'm going to do with him. - Have you seen Maximo? - He hasn't come back yet. I can't imagine what's happened to him. And Jos Lopez and Tomas Rinaldo, they left for Balintawak yesterday. And they haven't come back yet. He just won't eat. I don't understand it. He's been through a pretty rough experience. Yes, but his pulse is normal, his eyes are clear. What is his trouble? - Among other things, a woman. - A woman? This certainly is not the time for that sort of thing. - He's got to get her out of his mind. - Sometimes it isn't that easy. So we spend the winter in Palm Beach. - Doing what? - Taking it easy. - Have either of you seen Maximo? - No, ma'am. - Or Jos Lopez, or Tomas Rinaldo? - No, ma'am. Let's see. Now where were we? Taking it easy in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S.A. Yes. So we spend the winter in Florida. Then we hop a train, a streamliner, mind you. Nothing but the best for us. - We still don't buy any ticket for this train? - Who buys tickets? We hop off at New York in time for the opening ball game... - we crash a few shows. - Say, Joe... - Yes? ...when do we work? - Never. - I sure am going to like the USA. Say, where you been? Picklepuss has been looking for you. Okay. I know a place in New York where they make hot dogs a foot long. - A whole foot long? - Yeah. - With relish and mustard? - The works. Maybe you're wondering at this point how we get money to pay for these. There's ways and means of getting money without working. Strictly legal, mind you. Where have you been? The idea of a grown man talking like that before these boys. - What have you there? - A radio. Radio? Colonel, look, a radio. - Where'd you pick it up, in Balintawak? - No, I stole it from the Japs. ... then every man, woman, and child in the district will be wiped out. Filipinos, do not resist. For every Japanese life, we pay with 10 Filipino lives. Sixty Filipinos were executed today. I now read a list of the names... of those who paid with their lives for the recent disorders. In Balintawak, for the murder of four Japanese officers... 40 Filipinos were executed. Forty men. Tomas Rinaldo, age 28. Felipe Luiz, age 16. Juan Dios, age 30. Pablo Quincaro, age 19. - Ramon Cuenca, age 35... - That's my father. They killed my father! The war hurts everybody. Rest a while, and then we'll send you back to Balintawak. Your mother'll need you. But I'm coming back. You said I could. Sure, Maximo. ... submarines have been reported in the Gulf of Mexico... where they sank two American vessels. In Burma, British-Chinese forces continue to withdraw... up the Irrawaddy river towards Bhamo. Last night, after six days of ceaseless cannonading by the Japanese... the fortress of Corregidor in Manila Bay... and satellite forts, Hughes, Drum, and Frank... were surrendered at 11 p.m. by Lt. Gen. Jonathan Wainwright. - The news is a little tough. - Tough? We're licked, Joe. Licked? When is a nation licked? Military textbooks say a war is over when the objectives are taken. The United States fought your grandfather. - We found the textbooks were wrong. - Were they? You fought off the Spaniards for over 300 years... Then the American came. And a handful of revolutionaries, calling themselves the Katipunan... took everything we could throw at them. Fought us to a standstill with bolos and clubs. Now the Jap is here. What would've happened if we hadn't fought the Spaniard... if my grandfather hadn't called out the Katipunan? - You'd be slaves. - What are we now? I've been doing a lot of thinking these last few days. I wondered why you saved me out of all those thousands of prisoners. - You picked the wrong guy. - I picked Andrs Bonifacio. I know you did. Now you expect him to spread the word that Bonifacio's back. To arms, Filipinos. Remember the Katipunan. Kill the Japs, even if it means you'll be killed 10-to-1, 20-for-1. When there are no more men, then women and children, uselessly. - Uselessly? - You know that alone we're helpless. Where are all those American warships we were promised? Where are those American guns and planes? Why didn't they come to Bataan and Corregidor? I don't know. - Can you promise they'll come back? - I can't. Now you want me to urge them on to more slaughter! It's easy for you. They're not your people. I don't mean that, Joe. I know you're a better Filipino than I am. Maybe you should've left me prisoner. It's just that we've taken too much these last few months. Sure. A guy can only take so much, then he loses something. I know. I've seen too much. We really don't know whether the Americans are coming back or not. A guy's got to have something he wants to live for before he can ask others to die. Sure. After a while you lose something. Do you feel strong enough to go to Manila? - Trying to get rid of me? - Yes. You don't belong here. I'm willing to fight. In this kind of war, you got to believe in what you're fighting for. Maybe if you go to Manila, you'll find something... - that'll change your mind. Will you go? - Sure. I want to get a message through. I've got a contact there. We'll get you a monk's robe. You'll go to the chapter house of the Dominicans. Ask for the prior. Tell him you want to hear a confession. ...to intercede for the soul of Andrs Bonifacio... who has passed from this world. May he be set in a region of peace and light... through our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. You have come from the prior? - Andrs. - Dolici? Is it Dolici? I thought you were dead. Andrs, they are watching us. - Be careful. - I must look at you. Don't. There must be some place we can talk and see each other. - Dolici, you haven't gone? - No. I'm trying to think. There's a little park behind the church. Wait a few moments after I'm gone. I'll meet you there. - Dolici. - Darling. We have only a few moments together, and I'm crying. You haven't changed a bit. You're just as I remembered you a thousand times. I can't tell you how much I wanted this moment. How I wanted to hold you... Is there someplace we can be alone? Where? They cast a long shadow. I don't care. I can't leave you now that I've found you. What good can we do now? Maybe the Americans will come back someday. I'll come back with them then. No. We're not waiting for anyone to come back. We don't want freedom as a gift. We want it as a right to something we've fought and died for. - I'll kill him if he comes back. - I've got to go now. You're throwing away our happiness. Come away with me. - Are you with Madden? - Yes, we're on Balintawak. When can I see you again? When can I come back? Don't come back here ever. Maybe I'll be able to come to you. We must fight, Andrs. - So you came back? - Yeah. I saw Dolici. - Good. - You've known about her for some time? - Yes. - Why didn't you tell me? Didn't you think I'd like to know the woman I love was not a traitor? - I was under orders. - Orders? Yes, orders that might affect every American and Filipino on the island. Don't talk to me about the Filipinos. Mention freedom around them and they don't stop to think. They walk empty-handed into blazing machine-gun fire. But you and I should know better. We should stop to think if we've got a million-to-one chance. But no. You and Dolici have gone out of your heads. Okay, we're crazy. We and 17 million Filipinos. - What'd you come back here for? - Because I'm crazy, too. I wanna keep on fighting Japs, even though I know it's completely mad. Don't get me wrong. No one's gonna use my name... to encourage people to kill themselves faster than the Japs are doing it. I'll stick around and fight, only until Dolici decides to joins me. After that, we're getting out of here as fast as we can. All right, if that's the way you feel about it. We'll do the best we can without you. But just between us lunatics, I think we'll win. But what is being done? Your Excellency, we cannot find the enemy. We send 100 men out, and they see nothing. We send 10 men, and they don't come back. We have set up severe reprisals, Your Excellency. Reprisals. Your Excellency, you must let me resign. A dead man cannot serve the Japanese, no matter how hard he tried. Look, they came into my bedroom while I was asleep. They painted this on my pillow. Right next to my throat. This is a sign of war. This is my death warrant. You're in no danger. We'll provide sentries. I'm the Chief of Police. I had four sentries there all night. - You're under our protection. - Protection? Did you protect the Mayor of Legaspi, or the Commissioner of Malolos, or... Six whole divisions at your disposal... and you couldn't even protect our friends. All you could think about was reprisals. Send in Miss Dalgado. You have my personal guarantee of safety. You may go. Yes, thank you, Your Excellency. They might have just as easily slit my throat. Miss Dalgado, tell Col. Coroki... why we have failed to win the Filipino people over. I was not aware that... The guerrillas obviously have the complete aid and sympathy of the people. We are interested only in a frank answer. There's no advantage in cooperating with the Japanese. A man obeys all the Japanese laws. When he's taken at random and shot... his next-door neighbor will think, "It does a man no good to obey." He might as well die fighting. You're a conquered people. What do you expect, independence? That's not a bad idea, Coroki. Miss Dalgado, Tokyo has graciously consented... to grant full independence to its little nephews and nieces. Now your people will see the advantage of cooperating with us. Why, we will be able to hold these islands with only two divisions. The granting of independence must be an impressive occasion. - You will help us, Miss Dalgado? - It will be a great honor, Your Excellency. Perhaps it would be a good idea to hold the ceremonies at Balintawak. It's the birthplace of Philippine independence. An intelligent suggestion. The arrangements will be left in Col. Coroki's hands. To avoid any possible interference with the ceremony... I suggest you keep the place secret. We wish to make that a memorable occasion, Colonel. It will be a most memorable occasion, Your Excellency. Yes. Make it memorable, Colonel. Most memorable. You can find room for this. - Captain, everything's okay in Balintawak. - What did you tell them? - What you told me to say. - Tell me exactly what you said. I told them nobody was to do anything that might tip the Japs off. Everybody's supposed to do their business, do what the Japs said... and when the shooting started, everybody should scram. You told them the Japs have promised us full independence? - What did they say? - Nothing. Bernessa, get the drums going. Get all the men together. - Pvt. Cuenca? - Yes, sir? You accomplished your mission. I think he deserves a red star, Miss Barnes. Red star, indeed. In his last composition, he spelled "liberty" with a "U" instead of an "E." Say, Colonel, it will only take one informer to tip this whole deal off to the Japs. That's right. - What of it? - Nothing. Just thinking out loud, I guess. I don't know what I'm standing around for with so much to be done. Maximo, I've outlined a course of study for the children. You tell them they must keep up on their studies now. They must brush their teeth twice a day. Tell them to eat lots of greens if they can get them. I'm leaving with Col. Madden. - But I'm going along. - That's out of the question. Besides, you must take charge of the children. But he promised me. He said I could be a scout. Yes, I did, and I have been meaning to speak... You've done altogether too much playing at war for your age. I think... - I'm going to be a scout. - Maximo, you mustn't... If you don't mind, Colonel, Maximo is still my pupil. Now, you get that nonsense out of your head. - I'll get the outline. - I'm not going back. Maximo, if you insist on this stubbornness... I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave without saying goodbye. I'm going with you. Maximo, come here. Sit down. Miss Barnes loves you very much. I know. I'm sorry, but I want to go. You can't. After tomorrow, the Japs will be chasing us night and day. We're going to have to move fast. We'll be sleeping in swamps. There'll be days without food. Sounds okay to me. But you're much too important for us to risk. You're the guy we're fighting this war for. I'd rather be a Scout. This thing isn't going to last forever. And after it's over... you're going to have to be the one to build and plan. You'll help make the Philippines a great nation. You did promise me. You even called me "Pvt. Cuenca." All right. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll make you a full colonel. The first thing an officer has to learn is to take orders and obey them to the letter. Remember what Miss Barnes said. Take charge of those kids and make sure they keep up on their studies. Stay out of trouble. Got it? - Yes, sir. - Okay, Colonel. - I'll be seeing you. - Yes, sir. In a few moments, we will be on the air. In the meantime, here are the instructions for those gathered in this park. You are enjoined to obey strictly the following regulations. One: Do not show any flag but the Japanese flag. Two: At the appropriate times you will shout "banzai"... Ioudly, and with enthusiasm, three times. Three: Do not make any suspicious movement. We are about to broadcast. There will be a complete silence unless otherwise indicated. People of the Philippines... we are broadcasting from Balintawak, the birthplace of Filipino freedom. Seventeen million Filipinos are gathered around their radios all over the islands... at the invitation of the Japanese government. Today the seeds of Filipino and Japanese friendship flower and bloom. This day will live forever in the memory of every true Filipino. People of the Philippines, we now bring to you... His lmperial Highness, Prince lto. Banzai! The Filipino nation will be included... in the Greater East Asia, Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, by virtue of the authority... of His lmperial Majesty, the Emperor of Japan... I hereby proclaim to the world... the full and complete independence of the Republic of the Philippines. Banzai! There is lavish cheering from the people of Balintawak. His lmperial Highness, Prince lto, has retired. Miss Dolici Dalgado's crossing the platform... and will now raise the first flag of the new Philippine Republic. The guard of honor will fire a volley to commemorate this historic event. Take cover! Follow me! This is Dolici Dalgado speaking to you. For the first time I'm able to speak the truth. The Japanese have offered us what they call independence. Let this be our answer. Take cover! Fire at the radio. Destroy it! Cover Bonifacio. Resist the Jap invader. Head for the hills. Let's get out of here. Cease firing! Lieutenant, assemble the men, round up the civilians. This is what we get for granting them independence. I told Homma this gesture was foolish. This is no way to handle Filipinos. I knew the girl wasn't to be trusted. From now on, we'll smash them before they resist. Get out after them. Where do you suggest I look? Anywhere. But find them, especially the girl. I want them hounded until every one of them is brought back to me. Let me go. Your Excellency, I saw this boy direct a crowd off the field. I caught him as he was trying to run away. Where did you get this? Where are their headquarters? Talk! Where did they go? Don't. I'll show you. - I'll show you where they went. - All right. - You know what I've been thinking? - What? Wouldn't it be nice if we were on that road above... and had a bunch of Japs caught down here? It sure would. We could pick them off like ducks in a shooting gallery. We'd murder them. Hold it up. Here. Catch your breath. We could come down that road and catch the Japs like rats in a trap. They wouldn't have a chance. I'm all right. Come on, honey. There they are. Stop at the head of the canyon. - I know what you're thinking. - You do? How come? I'm psychic. What's that? Take cover! Boy, could we murder them. Stop it! Maximo. I won't tell. - I won't tell. - It's Miss Barnes, Maximo. - They didn't get you, did they? - No, dear, they didn't. They took my eagle away. - Miss Barnes. - Yes, dear? I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye. I'm sorry I didn't learn to spell "liberty." Dear God. Who ever learned it so well. Col. Madden, Australia has been trying to get you, sir. - Where have you got your radio set up? - This way, sir. About two weeks, sir. I think a razor, sir. Thank you. Bernessa, we're going on ahead. We're going to have to leave you. I got word from headquarters. - We're going with you, aren't we? - No. We have to move fast. You'd better break up into small groups and head for this spot in northern Leyte. American submarines have been putting in there. - What's up, Joe? - I don't know yet. Maybe something big. - Well, good luck. - Goodbye, Colonel. So long, Colonel. - Joe. - Yes? Good luck. Thanks, Andrs. I'll be seeing you. - Bernessa. - Santo. - Pepe. Captain. - Bernessa, how are you? - We had word you were coming. - Where is Col. Madden? Headquarters sent for him. They took him to Australia. But I think he'll be back soon. There's a camp up ahead. It's not very far. Come on, let's go. Thank you, Bernessa. Glad to see you. I'm Capt. Bonifacio. Welcome, Captain. We're glad to see you. - What are these people doing here? - They're waiting for the submarine. There are thousands more with their families all over this area. These people look like they're starving. Why don't you break up and spread over the countryside? We must stay together. Rumor is, this is where the action will take place. You'd risk all these lives on a rumor? The rumors we hear are true. How long have you been waiting for this submarine? - Two weeks. - Two weeks? How much food do you think a submarine can bring, if it comes? Not much food maybe, but many guns. - Have you had any word? - Not yet. We've been sending two men out in a boat. They fly an American flag and wait. Maybe a submarine will see them. What if a Jap plane sees them? Then we send two other men. Why are you puzzled? Aren't you a Filipino? Whose idea was it to volunteer for this job? Yours. I must have been delirious for lack of food. Maybe I'll dream me up a nice steak. Dream me one, too. - How would you like it? - Medium rare. Coming up. Submarine! Andrs. Capt. Bonifacio. - Hello, Andrs. - Hiya, Joe. You look naked. You're all set. You're going out. I'm not leaving, Joe. I belong here. This is Comdr. Waite of the United States Navy. He has good news for you. I heard so much about what you're doing here... I finally persuaded headquarters to let me take on this mission... so I could see for myself. I really don't deserve to be the one to bring you this news... but I'm proud that I am. Two and a half years ago, we promised the Filipino people we'd come back. We're coming. On October 20, at 10:00 in the morning... the soldiers of the American Army will land in force, right here on Leyte. The Navy will prepare the way. Two hours before the actual landings... there'll be heavy navy bombardment on all the landing areas. Part of my job is to get word to all Filipino civilians in those areas... to evacuate nine days before D-day. That'll give the Japs a good idea where to expect the landings. There's nothing else we can do. We can't risk civilian lives. There haven't been any civilians here since the fall of Bataan. If it'll save American lives and help make the landing safe... - our people will not evacuate. - That's right. I'm sure glad you guys are on our side. That won't be necessary. Headquarters has sent me here... to help you do a job that's more important, if we can do it. The moment naval bombardment begins... the Japs will know the exact locations of our landings. They'll immediately try to rush reinforcements to those spots. The only road capable of handling heavy transport... runs through the village of Bolog. If we can block that road and hold it... - the Japs can't get through in time. - How long do we hold them? From 8:00 in the morning, when the bombardment begins until 11:00. By that time, MacArthur's beachhead should be secure. Okay. But the army doesn't expect to have forces at Bolog until 2:30... which means six hours and a half before we can figure on any help. Okay. - Is that all, sir? - I think so. You don't seem to have much equipment. We'll get more at Bolog. There's a Jap supply depot there. That's open country, nothing but rice paddies all around. We know. What this amounts to is a surprise attack in broad daylight... in open country where the Japs would probably expect something. That's right, sir. It won't be easy. I think you can report to headquarters that the mission will be accomplished. Yes, sir. - Do you have any idea how it'll be done? - Sure. Just so I can tell my grandchildren, how do you plan to do it? Trickery, Commander, sheer trickery. As a matter of fact, an old Filipino trick that I learned the hard way... from Capt. Bonifacio's grandfather. - Any sign of anything? - No, Your Excellency. Have you checked the undergrowth over there? Yes, Your Excellency. Nothing suspicious. It's very strange. Civilians are evacuating this area. - Double the sentries. - Yes, Your Excellency. Get down, you idiot! One more to go. I'll take the first one. - You got a grenade, Bernessa? - I'm all out, sir. Hey, Bindle! - Yeah? - How's your pitching arm? Come on. Let's get to work. Japanese land mines, sir. - Andrs, some land mines. - Good. Plant them far enough forward so they won't mess up our tank traps. Put Santos in charge of TNT for the bridge. Santos, come on. - Bernessa. - Yes, sir? Get about 20 men. We'll pick out some defense positions. Yes, sir. What do you got here? Nothing big enough to stop a tank, Colonel. Miss Barnes... they're bringing back the books they hid while the Japs were here. And our boys are landing now. This is it. Fire at the parapet. Capt. Jackson reporting, sir. Ready to take over. - They're all yours. - Yes, sir. You're three minutes late! I brought you something. Free Filipino soil. You better get this arm bandaged. There's still lots to do. And there's plenty more where that came from. The blood, sweat, and tears have not been in vain. Freedom is on the march again. English
