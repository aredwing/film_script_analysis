They should-- you already own them. Hmm? You bought the same pair last week. Oh... I forgot. Disappointed. You know, that's what I love about you best, Jen. Any time I feel guilty about how much money I'm dishing out on clothes, or shoes, or handbags-- you're always there to outspend me. Well, what are friends for? Thank you. Okay, now for the biggest decision of the day... Where to have lunch. Oh, I don't know. I don't know if I have time. I need to update my fashion blog this afternoon. Oh, honey, the world can wait a few more hours for your next fashion post. Ooh! How about Maison de Salade? No, they're under renovations. Here. Selfie! You know, it's not just about fashion, though. I do write about other important things, like what's trending in hair and makeup. Oh, right. Oh, what about Fontaine Noire? No! They have that awful hostess. She was so rude last time. Yeah. Well, there's always Avenue 99. They have that really cute waiter, Jean-Paul. I'm sorry, Miss Stone, do you have another card? There was a problem with this one. Pardon me? Your charge card, it was declined. Try it again, please. I tried it twice. Maybe you have another one. Okay. Here. Thank you. Okay, wait, I thought you were off the market. Haven't you been seeing that "Tim" guy for almost a month? Ted and I are so over. What happened? He called me irresponsible. Can you imagine? I'm... Terribly sorry, Miss Stone. This one was declined as well. What? Okay. I told you this place has gone downhill. Just leave your bags and we'll go shop somewhere else. No, I don't understand. How could both of these have been declined? [Cell phone rings] Daddy? You won't believe what just happened. What? What? What? We're broke? Daddy, you're joking, right? I wish I were, sweetheart, but it's true. I'm filing for bankruptcy in the morning. Mr. Gordon, you're his lawyer. How could you let this happen? Well, Jen, the foreign exchange markets, I'm afraid, are a little bit out of my control. I mean, we had a contingency, but what with the financial situation in Europe right now, and some of your father's larger investments underperforming-- [dad]: The truth is, I took some risks that I, you know, probably shouldn't have, and once the dominoes start falling, they can be pretty hard to stop. Sweetheart, I'm really sorry, okay? Don't worry, daddy, we'll get through this. I mean, I still have my trust fund. We can live on that until you get your feet back on the ground. I do still have my trust fund, don't I? I didn't want to tell you this, sweetheart, but you spent your way through all of that about a year ago. But you always look fabulous. What... No, I'm sure I still have money in it. Your father has been topping that account up for months now, and now that's gone, too. Bankrupt... I can't believe this. We've lost everything? Well, not quite. There's the farm... What farm? I forgot about the farm. Just a little piece of property that I bought about a year ago. It was like, what 50? 50 acres. It's just two hours north of the city. And it's in your name. A pumpkin farm? I thought it would be a nice little investment for you. You know, they were talking about doing some condos on the land, and then the local government wouldn't rezone it, so the land can't be developed. Now it's all yours. I own a pumpkin farm. You own a pumpkin farm? [Jen]: Yeah, but not for long. I'm just going up there to check the place out, sign some papers, and sell it as soon as I can. I heard about your dad. I am so sorry. Everything will be okay. And after all, it's just money, right? Brooke, did I lose you? No! Still here. Um... anyway... good luck. Lunch this week? I'll call you. [] [] Oh, here, let me. -Thank you, ma'am. -Mm-hmm. Poor Fred. Took a bad fall off his back porch. It's gonna be a tough harvest for him this year. Grab a seat anywhere you'd like. Special today is the hot chicken sandwich. Oh, no thank you. I don't do carbs. My GPS doesn't seem to be working this far out of the city. I was wondering if anyone can help me find the Jarrett farm? Brett Jarrett? I think that that's his name. It's... yeah. Brett Jarrett. How do I get there? Um... Mind if I ask why? Of course. I own the place. -You? -Mm-hmm. I haven't been there, so I figured I'd go check it out before I sell. You're gonna sell the Jarrett place? Going to try. Keep going down this road, second left, all the way to the end, one more right turn, and you're there. Got it. Thank you! And, um... You may want to rethink those shoes. I think they'll be fine. Who was that? Trouble. [] [] [Knocks] Hello? [] [Horse whinnies] [Horse whinnies] Oh, hello! Hello? Oh! I am so sorry! Sorry? You just ruined a $2,000 outfit! Why are you wearing a $2,000 outfit on a farm? Why are you not looking where you're going? Uh...Why are you on my property? Because it's not your property, sir, it's my property. Oh. You're the girl from the city. The one who owns the place. Yeah, I am. And I am going to have to have a little talk with your boss, Mr. Jarrett. You are. Oh. Well then. Hello. I'm Jennifer Stone. Brett Jarrett. Look, I'm sorry about that, okay? I didn't see you there. Why don't you come on up to the house, we'll get you dried up. I am fine, Mr. Jarrett. Just because I'm from the city doesn't mean that I can't handle a little mud. Suit yourself. -Hey, Miss Stone? -Yes? I've got some clothes here that you can borrow until Aunt Rosie dries yours. Thank you. Just leave them outside. We'll see ya downstairs. Thank you. Hi. This is pretty fancy stuff. The next time you decide to throw a complete stranger in the mud, you'd better pick someone who doesn't have such expensive taste. Well, I didn't "throw" her into the mud, Aunt Rosie. She bumped into me and fell. Really? Really. Look, is it my fault that she doesn't know her way around a farm? Whoa. Whose sweet car is that-- boots! It's Miss Stone. The one from the city? They don't grow 'em that way out here. Where is she? She's in the bathroom, changing, 'cause we had an accident. You already talk to her about not selling the place yet? No. I haven't had a chance. To be honest with you, I don't think it's gonna do much good. She kind of seems like the girl who's used to getting her own way. You just have to talk some sense into her, big brother. Tell her that Jarretts have been on this farm for 75 years, and as soon as we can put the money together, we're gonna buy it back. Yeah, well, if we have another year like we did last year, we'll barely keep the lights on. If your mother heard you talking like that, she would wash your mouth out with soap. Well, it's just not fair, that's all, Aunt Rosie. I mean, some "Lady," like this Miss Stone comes along, doesn't know nothing from nothing, thinks she can just up and sell our home out from underneath us? Yeah, well, it doesn't need to be fair, not for her. They don't like people like us, they don't like farming. 'Kay? They're just going to come in here and sell this place to the highest-- well! You make those clothes look a lot better than I do. Miss Stone. This is our Aunt Rosie. How do you do, Miss Stone? Oh, just Jen, please. Thank you for the loaners. How are my clothes doing? Well, I'm going to hang them outside, but they'll-- they'll live. Hi, I'm Harry. The better-looking younger brother. Hi. [Girl giggles] And that little munchkin right there is my daughter, Abby. Hi, Abby. Hey. She's a little shy. Oh, that's okay. Where's your mommy? My mommy's in heaven. I'm... I'm sorry... Can I get you some coffee, Miss Stone? Aunt Rosie makes the best in the county. Actually, um... If you don't mind, I'd like to just start surveying the property now. You ride, Miss Stone? Ride? Horses. I've ridden, yeah. Let's go have a look at your farm. It was nice meeting you guys. Okay. You all right, Miss Stone? I'm fine, thank you. You really think he's just gonna let her sell the place? I don't see that he has much of a choice. But knowing your brother... He's not going to make it easy. Shall we? I thought you said you rode? I've ridden in Griffith Park. They were ponies! Huh. Nice. Go. Go. Yes. Ooh! Okay. Oh, no. Oh! [Brett]: Over there's the east field. It's where we rotate the crops. Corn, hay, barley, you know, depends on the weather, or whatever's in demand. But this here's where we make our real money. That is a lot of pumpkins. You know, people carve 'em up for Halloween, eat 'em for Thanksgiving. After that, you can't give 'em away. Come on. Oh, okay. Oh, that's cute. What's that? It's nothing. Hmm. Okay... Look. There's oil everywhere. That's-- that's got to be-- I can see the oil. I can-- well, where's that come from? The injector pump. Is not. Do you have to argue-- I just happen to be right--again. What's up? Darn thing konked out again. The injector pump's gotta be fixed. Not the injector pump. The cylinders, valves need replacing. You don't know what you're talking about. I know more than you. No, you don't. Lou, Phil, hey, this is Miss Stone. Miss Stone, this is Lou and Phil. These are my lead hands. And as if you can't tell by the bickering. Husband and wife. [Lou]: Right, right. You're the one Brett said is gonna put us outta work? I'm not so sure about that. I am. Come on, you sell this farm, you think they're gonna wanna keep a couple of old goats like us around? All right, you know what, I'll finish up, and then come have a look at that. It was very nice meeting you both. -Mm-hmm. -Mm-hmm. Go. That way. Yeah. It's the injector pump. Is not. -Is too. -Is not. -Is too. -Is not. Well, where does the oil come from? Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Was that really necessary? What? You told them that I might be the reason that they lose their jobs? Well, it's the truth, isn't it? Don't you have other farm hands here? I can't hire 'em full-time. We just bring 'em in when it's harvest-- aw, really? Come on! Okay... whoa. Okay! Okay! I'm coming! Okay! Whoa! Oh. Do you really need to do that now? I have to get going. Well, we never leave a fence broken, okay? It's kind of a tradition around here. I'm not really big into tradition. Well, maybe not, but when your neighbors' cattle come into your property, they can eat your bottom line faster than you can say "moo." Well, if you ask me, this whole place needs fixing. You've really let it go. Well, maybe I've had a few things on my mind. Well, that tractor back there looks like it's on its last legs. You guys should just get rid of it and buy a new one. Let me try and explain something to you, Miss Stone. Okay, on the farm, when something's broken, we don't just get rid of it, okay? We try to fix it. [Whinnies] You all right? You did that on purpose! What? I get that you don't like me, Mr. Jarrett, and quite frankly, I am not so fond of you either, but we are stuck in this together, and I would appreciate it if you didn't try to kill me. I did not try to kill you. I'm going to go find a real estate agent, fill out whatever papers a real estate agent needs me to fill out, and I'm going to sell this place, and we never need to see each other again. The house is the other way. Goodbye. I'm sorry I couldn't have been more help, miss, but with things being the way they are and all, and what not, well, you know, it's just the way it is, like that, and that's all there is to it. I'm sorry, too. [Dad]: I'm in here, sweetie. So how'd it go with the real estate agent? It went... great. They were really helpful. That's good, that's good. So did you find out how much your little farm is worth? Not the exact amount, but... It is worth... A lot of money. Now all we have to do is find you a buyer, right? Exactly. Um... I left your old bedroom for you to pack. I wouldn't know what you might want to keep and what you might want to throw away, you know? It's going to be okay, dad. Of course it is. [] [] How much is the farm worth? Are you guys rich again? Let's just say if I were to sell tomorrow, the land, the buildings, all the equipment... It wouldn't buy me a first-class bus ticket to Bakersfield. Wait, what? How is that even possible? They've got a lot of bills, and they've got all these outstanding debts in the town. It's just-- it's a mess. I'm so sorry, honey. What are you going to do? Maybe I should get a job? A job? What would you do? [Sighs] I don't know. I'm so depressed. I can't even afford to go shopping to get over it. Let's go down to the salon and get makeovers. I can't... Come on, it is my treat. And it always helps when you're in a bad mood. Let's go. Thank you, Brooke, but I really don't think that this problem can be solved with a-- Brooke! What? That's it. That's what I'm going to do! See, I told you. There is nothing in life that a few new highlights can't fix. No, not for me. I'm going to give the pumpkin farm a makeover! Oh! Ha-hah. That's so smart. [] [Guitar playing] Don't stop on my account. That was your mom's favorite song. I never could get it right, though. You always got it right enough for her, I bet. [Car approaches] Well well. Brett! We've got company. Hi! [] I wore sensible shoes this time. Oh, wait. I forgot my sunglasses. There we go. This is already looking better. It's really pretty, isn't it, daddy? Yeah. So what you're saying is you want us to work together? All of us. Rosie, Harry, Phil, Lou. I bet there's even something that Abby can do. I want to be the pumpkin Princess. The what? [Harry]: Something grandma would do with her during the harvest. Abby'd ride on top of the tractor with a little crown on her head. It wasn't a crown, Uncle Harry, it was a tiara. I stand corrected. Yes, you do, but we don't do that anymore. Okay, so let's say we help you, we fix the place up, make it more profitable. And more valuable for potential buyers. And then you turn around and you sell it for a higher price? Exactly. Okay, well, let me state the obvious, then. What's in it for us? I'm glad that you asked, because right here-- excuse me-- um, okay... Here. "If party a", that's you, "agrees to the terms set out by party b," that's me, "then as a condition of any sale of the property, "party a will be entitled "to continue residing and working on the property "as an employee of any new owner. In perpetuity." That sounds really official. [Jen]: My dad's lawyer helped me with it, but I came up with everything. So what do you say? Well, when would you want to start something like this? How about now? My bags are in the car. Wait... so... You want to stay here? With us? Well, why not? I kind of own the place. I think that at least gives her rights to the guest room? Harry, would you like to help me with my suitcases? All right. What? This was Mr. and Mrs. Barrett's room. I put fresh linens on, there's towels by the basin. I hope it'll be all right? It's lovely. And so authentic! I think with some new wallpaper, maybe a bright rug, a couple of throw pillows, it'll be perfect. Help. Oh, just put it there. Okay. Thank you! That's a lot of luggage. Aunt Rosie, can you help me get the rest of it? Well, I didn't know how long I was going to be staying. I can't very well be caught wearing the wrong season, could I? No. No, I guess not. Brett. I just... I wanted to apologize for before. I might have overreacted a little bit. Just a little? All right, maybe more than a little, but I just wanted to say that I'm sorry and I hope that we can put it all behind us. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Well, I appreciate that. No problem. I should check on Lou and Phil. The tractor, you know, it's acting up. Okay. Okay. Okay. Is she really just staying with us or is she moving in with us? Give me that. I can't believe you're really going to go through with this. Don't worry about it. Look, a couple of weeks of farm living, she's gonna give up, she's gonna go back to the city. Yeah, but what about the farm? She'll sell it, and then when nobody's buying, we'll pick it up for a song, and the Jarrett farm will be in the Jarrett family once again. But what makes you so sure she's gonna quit? You know how hard the work can be around here. [] [Rosie]: It's occupied! Sorry, sorry! [Abby]: ...And bless cousin Hannah, and Aunt Paula, and Uncle Rory, and Mrs. Carmichael, and Dr. Wilson, and grandma and grandpa, and buster the cat, and Wonder Woman, and especially bless mommy. Amen. Okay, into bed. There we go. How long is she going to stay? Who? You know who. Jennifer. I'm not sure, honey. Not long. I like her. Do you like her, daddy? Yeah. She's very nice. No. I mean do you like her? Goodnight, honey. [Abby]: Goodnight, dad. [Rosie]: Bathroom's free. I was, um... Uh-huh. Well, if you need anything, fresh towels or something, let me know. Thank you. Am I interrupting something? No. Just girl talk. Well, make sure you get lots of sleep tonight. We start pretty early in the morning. Oh, I'm used to that. I do a morning yoga class back in L.A., it starts at 9:00 A.M. Yeah. See you in the morning. -'Night. -Night. Excuse me. [Crickets chirping] [Owl hooting] [Crickets chirping] [Crickets chirping] [Birds twittering] [Rooster crowing] [Horses whinnying] [Rooster crowing] What is that? What is that sound? What is happening? What's going-- um, I... -Whoa. Hey... -I was, uh... -Sorry, I... -Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. What was that noise? -What noise? -[Rooster crows] That. [Chuckles] That's old Frankie. He's telling us it's morning. Already? It's 5:00 A.M.! Yeah. Rise and shine! [Frankie crows] Good morning! Yeah. Morning. Good morning, everybody. [Group]: Good morning. Fancy. Coming from a fashion plate like you, that's a compliment. Lou, if you ever want any tips, I'd be happy to help. That'll be the day. -[Lou stomps her foot] -Ow! I've got a big stack of pancakes with your name on it. Oh, Rosie! No thank you. I don't really do breakfast. Maybe just a smoothie? I'll put these in the blender. You know, I thought maybe we could start the day by showing you how we do things around here. Yeah, get you a feel for how the farm works, get your hands dirty. If you're up for it. Oh, I am not afraid of hard work, that's for sure. That's great. Let's get to it! O...Kay. [Brett]: All right, first thing, I think you should get acquainted with our irrigation system. Sounds good. Water is very important. We're supposed to have eight glasses a day, you know? Sure. Now, it is automatic, of course, but every single morning, it's got to be checked for leaks or cracks in the dribbler heads. Okay, so how do we do that? Old-fashioned way's best. Up and down the rows, one line at a time. The whole thing? The whole thing. I mean, unless you're not up for it. I've done the warehouse sale at Barneys every spring. I think I can do this. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. You know, she doesn't need to check the irrigation. We had that alarm system installed last summer in case of leaks? Yeah. I know. You poor thing. How long are you going to be stuck up there for? I'm not sure exactly. I mean, I guess until we get this place on its feet. Well, it sounds absolutely horrible. IT'S NOT THAT BAD. Look. I'm in the field like a real country girl! [Snap, water hissing] Well... Just make sure you're using a good sunblock. I have to go. Talk to you later. [Shrieks] [Shrieking] This is going to be easier than I thought. [Radio plays country music] [Lou]: I'm starving. You are all gonna wash up before you sit at my table. Yeah! Chili con carne, my favorite! Ow. You never get that excited when I make chili con carne. That's 'cause yours tastes like the carne's trying to get outta the pot. [Lou]: Oh, you zip it. Where's Jen? She's on her way. Yeah, after she fed the chickens and did the pumpkin count. Pumpkin count? Aunt Rosie, you know how important it is that we know exactly how many pumpkins are on the vine. Oh, you poor thing. Look at you! I'm okay. I mean, I will be, as soon as I get some feeling back in my legs. You go on up and soak in the tub. I'll fix you a tray. Oh, no, Rosie, I don't want to be a bother. No bother. You go on now. What? [Groans] Ai. Oh! Oh... Wow. You've got a bad sunburn. Uh-huh. Looks like my jar of L'oublier moisturizer is no match for your country sunshine. You should try some of grandma's cream. What's grandma's cream? Come on. My grandma used to make it. There's still a little bit left. Pumpkin-y. It is. Go ahead, try it. My mommy used it all the time. Do you think your mommy would like it? Well, my mommy's in heaven, like yours. Oh. You think they're friends? [Jen]: I'm sure they are. I gave Jen some of grandma's cream, daddy. That's nice, honey. Food's getting cold. Oh! Kiss to make it better. She is a sweetheart. That she is. I thought you said that this place was "nothing". Well, my dad built it for mom. With a houseful of boys and a bunkhouse full of farm hands, you can imagine she needed her own space. Yeah. Maggie liked it in here, too. May I? Yeah. "Harvest Moon." What's that? It was a big party that we used to have at the start of harvest season. You know, when all the farmhands would come back to town, they probably wouldn't have seen each other for about a year, and my mom and dad, they'd throw a big old shindig, with food and drinks, dancing. The whole town would pretty well show up. It was a lot fun... Sounds like it. That's Abby being the Pumpkin Princess. Yeah. Yeah, I miss it. Why don't you guys do it anymore? It just wouldn't seem right. Not now. Listen, I know today was rough. We'll make sure tomorrow's a little easier. Oh, don't do it on my account. If we've got to get this place up and running, I need to work just as hard as anybody else-- including you, sir. Yes, ma'am. Hmm. [Knocking on door] Come in! Jen, I was figuring, if you're going to stick around here, you're going need something that'll take the wear and tear a little better than those my little farmer outfits of yours, so here. Rosie...Thank you. You can thank me by taking care of yourself. I get sore just looking at you. How's your sunburn? Oh, it's so much better, thanks to this stuff that Abby gave me. Abby named it "Grandma's Pumpkin Cream." That's the very last of it, too. I looked it up on the Internet, I can't find anything on it. Oh, you won't. My sister kept the recipe top-secret. I mean, she wrote it down someplace, but I haven't been able to find it since... You know. Do you mind me asking... What happened? Car accident... Rainy night... My sister, her husband, and Brett's wife, Maggie. It happened very fast. I'm so sorry. Yeah, it was a tough thing. It still is. But you gotta keep going. That's what we do around here. Well, I think that's enough of me pontificating. Good night, dear. Good night. Sweet dreams. [Crickets chirping, owl hooting]] [Howling] [Playing ocean sounds] [Ocean sounds playing] [Jen sighs, relaxed] [Restaurant patrons chatting] [] Harry. Hi. Hey. I have been asking all over town, but nobody seems to know. Is there someplace that we can get a pumpkin labeler? A what? You know, to label our pumpkins with our own logo. If we're going to create a Jarrett brand pumpkin, we're going to need our own logo. Catchy, but-- she's pretty. What's her name? Valerie. Are you two, you know? Me and her? No. She'd never go out with me. Well, have you asked her? No. I couldn't do that. Hey. Coffee? Yes. Hi, Harry. Uh... hi. Are you going to the dance for Mr. Jenkins this weekend? Uh... no. There's a dance? [Valerie]: Uh... yeah. He broke his leg, so they're doing a fundraiser at the community center to help him out. I thought maybe you were going. Anyway, I will be back to take your order in a sec. Harry. She obviously wants you to ask her to the dance. I can't dance. Well, you are going to have to learn. [] I got a feelin' inside I got an ache in my bones it keeps telling me I just ought to leave you alone I've got a song in my head sounds like the Rolling Stones singing "Brown Sugar" [] I'm thinking years from now about the two of us maybe I'm thinking I'm thinking too much maybe I'm thinking I'm thinking too much [] Right in here is where we plant the seedlings, to start the crop for next harvest. Aw, little baby ones. That must be why they call it a nursery. Must be. Okay, so what you do is you may an impression. Okay. Mm-hmm. Got it. And then you kind of do a little scissor grab. Okay, I think I can do this. Scissor grab. Okay, you want to press the earth down firmly around it. -Just like this. -Okay. Yeah. Here you go. And then you just want to plant the rest of them. Okay. Okay. How's my favorite pumpkin expert? Great, daddy. Just great. We are really getting it into shape. How about you? Everything okay? Good. Good... As well as can be expected, I suppose. We're working out a deal with the creditors, and I can see some light at the end of the tunnel. Don't worry, daddy. Once I get this place running smoothly, there will be buyers lined up down the street. You'll be back on your feet in no time. Okay, hon'. Love you. Love you. Oh. [Groans] [] [] Hey! Brett. I think she's starting to get the hang of it around here. [] Yeah, she sure is. [] It's got to be here somewhere. What if it's not a written recipe? What if the skin cream is just something that she remembered how to make? No, she definitely wrote it down. She used to say she kept the recipe in a place close to her heart. If we find grandma's secret recipe, do I get to be a Princess again? Abby... You get to be the Princess all you want... [Gasping] You clever girl! -This is it! -Yes! This is it! You takin' over for Rosie now, too? Lou! You are just the person I wanted to see! Can I steal you for a minute? Okay. Okay... There we go. How is this feeling? Uh... it's nice. Yeah, yeah. It's nice. It's tingly. Really tingly. Mm-hmm. Ooh... Ooh, good? Ooh, bad. No good? Yeah, no good. Okay, okay. Sorry. Okay, sorry. Too much lemon. Maybe it's just too late to help somebody like me. No, no. It is never too late. We're going to start over and try again. Okay. Less lemon. Say no to lemon. It looks good. Got her up and running. Atta boy. Yeah, but for how long's anybody's guess. Hey, you see that wife of mine around anyplace? [Lou]: Right here, ya old fool. Oh, there you are. Notice anything different about me? You smell like pumpkins. That's it? What do you want from me? Okay, Jen, you're on fence inspection duty this afternoon. Not the horses again? Well, that depends. Do you know how to drive a stick? Absolutely. My daddy once bought me the most adorable little vintage Aston Martin one summer. This is a little different, though, right? Got this, you see, has two sticks. All right, guys, I'm not completely helpless, you know? If I can manage the traffic on Pacific Coast Highway in the summer, I think I can figure out a tractor. Okay? -All right. -Thank you. [Engine chugs to life] Oh, yeah. Here we go. [Tractor crashing] I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! -Jen! -Sorry! You all right? I'm okay, I'm okay. I just-- I feel like-- a complete... Idiot. What were you thinking, letting her drive this thing? She said she knew how. No, it was not his fault. Do not blame him. No, you know what? No, it's my fault. It's my fault for agreeing to this whole deal in the first place! Why don't you go back to the house and pack up your 300 suitcases, and go back to the city... Because that's where you belong. [] Don't worry about him, hon'. Men are like that sometimes. They've got to blow off steam, I guess. I'm not... I'm not upset about him. I just-- I ruined your beautiful flowers. Don't worry about that. There are plenty more where those came from. Come on. I'll show you. You're going to like this. Oh... Yeah. Maggie, that was Brett's wife, she loved her violets. They're so beautiful... They're her very own variety, too. She kept cross-pollinating different types until she got just the right color and fragrance. Do you guys sell a lot of them? Oh, no. No. We've never sold a single one. What do you mean? I saw them at dot's cafe. No, no. Brett won't sell them. He gives them away... To keep Maggie's memory alive. So what was that all about? What was what all about? You know what I'm talking about. Jen and the tractor. It was an accident. You didn't have to go all ballistic about it. Yeah, well, she could've wrecked the place. She could've hurt herself. Or worse. You've been talking a lot about getting rid of her for the farm's sake. Yup. That's right. You sure this isn't all about something else? Like what? Like maybe she's bringing back some bad memories for you. I think you got company. Hey, I need to talk to you. You're still here? I thought you were selling the place. Brett and I are... Kind of working together. I'll take a latte. Decaf, non-fat, please. I'll get right on that. She really doesn't like me, does she? Nah. You're just from out of town and she's a local. That's all. Look, if this is about yesterday, I am sorry. I was out of line. No. It's about these. I've been doing some research and violets are a seriously lucrative cash crop. People love them. And you have an entire greenhouse full of them. No. But it's all about the branding. If we started marketing these as the Jarrett Violet, that would give the farm another identifiable revenue stream, which could help me sell the property-- what part of "no" don't you understand? The violets are not for sale. Okay... Brett, I understand what they mean to you-- no. I don't think that you do. Hannah, can you cancel my order, please? I've lost my appetite. Hi, Jen. We're making some pies. Jennifer doesn't do pies, dear. You know what? I want pie. I'm trying to help, but he's not helping back. It's like he deliberately wants us to fail or something. I don't-- I don't understand. Well, sometimes, people get stuck in life, and all they really need is just a little... push. Yeah, well, I'd like to push him off that swing. [Harry]: Jen, I need to talk to you. [Jen]: Not right now, Harry. I'm a little busy. What are you doing? Something that should've been done a long time ago. Hi, daddy! Hey. You look good on that. What's this? Did you fix that? No, Jen did it. Jen? You know where Jen is? I don't know exactly. But if you asked, I was supposed to say she was making sure that nobody ate your bottom line. All right, kiddo. [] Whoa. That's nice work, Miss Stone. I was also impressed with the porch swing. Thank you. At least I can do something right around here. I wanted to say that I'm sorry. I've been acting like a jerk. Yeah. Kinda. Why don't you leave that stuff here? Come on. -Okay. -Grab the horn if you like. -Okay. Can I hold you? -Sure. Whoa. Whoa. -Okay. -Okay? [Jen]: I'm on it. -Nice and easy. -Okay. [Jen]: Here we go. [] [Thunder rumbles, rain falling] Here comes the rain. Yeah, I used to love the rain. It always meant things were gonna grow. You know, you're allowed to move on. Yeah, I know. I just don't know if I can. Sometimes, it helps... ...if you don't have to do it alone. Yeah. I think you're right. [] [Crickets chirping] [Howling] [Crickets chirping] [Crickets chirping] [Jen sighs, owl hoots] You still up? Yeah, I couldn't sleep. Pudding. I think Jen made this. You know, I'm starting to think that I misjudged this whole situation. What do you mean? Mm! This is really good! It is good. I don't know, I just think maybe things have been the same around here for too long, huh? Maybe. I was thinking, okay, what if we can turn this place around, make a profit? Maybe we could hire some more full-timers. Yeah. I could use the help. Not just to help you. To replace you. Where am I going? School, maybe? The rest of the world? I don't know. Look, I just want you to know you've got a choice, all right? You know, just because Jarretts have been on this property forever doesn't mean they've gotta be here forever. It's Jen, isn't it? She's having an effect on you. All of us. All right, don't hog that. Come on. Did she really make that? I think-- I mean, who else? [Old Frankie crows] [Old Frankie crows] Good morning! Good morning. [Jen]: Yes, let the bank know that we will have the updated financials in a few weeks. Well, we have several new revenue streams that we are very excited about, including a rare flower that is exclusive to the Jarrett farm. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Bye. Where's the jar that was in here? I don't know, dear. It was there last night. Huh. I had no idea that Grandma's Pumpkin Cream was going to be so popular around here. Lou! What's up? Uh... well... See, the thing is, we've got this dance tonight, for Fred Jenkins. And Phil thinks we oughta go. That will be so much fun for you guys! [Groans] Yeah. I just wondered if maybe you had some more of that pumpkin jelly? Maybe you could give me a hand? I would love to, Lou. I'm gonna give you the works. Wow. Come on. Oh, one more thing-- I hope you don't mind, but I brought a few friends with me. All right, we're done. How does that feel? Oh, my. How was it? That felt heavenly. Yay! Okay, next? I hope you don't mind, especially after the way I was to you, but city girls and country girls don't always mix. Well, in here, we're just girls. [Pats chair] All right. Have you ever had a facial? No, I haven't. No. Okay. So, step number one-- clean your face. Okay. You want it all gone. [] This is fun. Beautiful! Thank you. [] [] [Crickets chirping] [Brett]: Harvest Moon. Fullest moon of the year. Used to remind the farmers it was time to bring in the crops. It's so beautiful. 'Course now we've got all this scientific stuff to help us do that, but I don't know, I kind of like the tradition. A little something I can pass on to Abby. You're doing a wonderful job with her. I bet it's not always easy. Well, you know, when it happened, my life... Our lives changed forever. I never thought I'd let myself feel anything ever again. I think that's how my dad felt... When my mom died. Maybe that's why he spoiled me here and there, to make up for it. But he kept going, you know? Because I needed him to. Like you're doing for Abby. Well, there are some days that I could use some help. Rosie's wonderful. I wasn't talking about Rosie. [Birds twittering] [Jen]: I'll get it! Know where a girl can find a pumpkin around here? Brooke! You made it! Okay, what is that horrible smell? That'd be nature. Brooke, this is Brett Jarrett, the one I was telling you about. Hi. My, they grow them big around here. Pleasure to meet you, ma'am. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I'll take that upstairs for you. Thank you! Oh, I just have a couple more in the car, if you don't mind. Please? Hah... hmm. -I'll see you downstairs. -Yep. It was nice meeting you, Brooke. Likewise. So what do you think? Of the man or the room? Both. I'm serious, though. Okay, look, Jen, this is all very charming, but let's be honest, you're a city girl. I'm not so sure about that anymore. You can't tell me you don't miss civilization. Flush toilets. Electric lights. The wheel. It's not that bad. And besides, country life has its perks. Mm-hmm. For example, I have been dying to share this with you. It's skin cream. Brett's mom used to make it out of the pumpkins that they grow here. How inventive. Try it. It's amazing. And that little jar would be a fortune back in the city. All right, okay, so the condiments are cheaper. But what about the culture? What about the nightlife? I am so glad you asked. [] I've got a song in my head sounds like the Rolling Stones singing "Brown Sugar" [] When I'm lookin' at you as you're dancin' like that I like the summer dress I dig the cowboy hat my mind's saying "she's something that you'll regret" my heart's saying "whatever"... I didn't know it was going to be a costume party. Oh, it's nice. I mean, look at everyone from the community, coming together to help out one of their own. ...I'm thinking years from now about the both of us... This kind of thing would never happen in L.A. Oh, it'd happen... Only everybody would be wearing black and ignoring each other. ... I'm thinking too much Evenin', ladies. Good evening. Ma'am, may I have this first dance? Do you mind? Go! Go! Thank you! Yeah, go ahead. ...girl, you'll look real good on the back of my bike I see you gettin' your way when you wanna start a fight and me sayin' "baby, please" I see me buying you roses and us drinkin' fine wine goin' far-off places havin' us a good time walkin' down some beach I'll take your hand in mine and get down on one knee I'm thinkin' about your smile I'm thinkin' about your touch I'm thinkin' this ain't love but it's close enough I'm thinkin' years from now about the both of us... Come on, man. You can do this. ...maybe I'm thinkin' I'm thinkin' too much... So? Are you ever going to ask me to dance? Um... Yes. ...I'm thinkin' here my chance why wait? Yeah, I'm talkin' to you askin' what's your name and I'm thinkin' I'm crazy when I hear you say... I'm thinkin' about your smile I'm thinkin' about your touch I'm thinkin' this ain't love but it's close enough I'm thinkin' years from now about the two of us maybe I'm thinkin' I'm thinkin' too much maybe I'm thinkin' I'm thinkin' too much [] Whoo! You did so good! Yeah, I don't know what's keeping her. It's just like a woman, right? ...your smile goes from zero to 60 Geez Louise! Is that you? You don't like it? Would you... Do me the honor of this dance? Yes, of course, Phil. Come on. Let's go. [] ...it does something to me just watching I love how you laugh [] I've gotta warn ya. Since the last time I danced... It's... it's been a while. Dancing with a city girl, Mr. Jarrett. People are going to talk. Let 'em talk. There's nothing on earth more pleasing than the sweet up and down of your chest you're eyes crinkle up and I'm so in love praying the moment won't pass [] It's the sound... Okay, the first time I met her was in the diner. She owns my cousin's farm, but she came up from the city to sell it. But Harry told me Brett's been messin' with her and giving her all sorts of really hard, fake jobs, hoping that she'll quit, and they'll be able to buy back the farm for nothing. But I feel bad about it because I'm really starting to like her. ...your kiss makes me whole there's something about how the laughter comes out that goes straight to my soul it fades out and things become quiet... Ahem. Can I talk to you? Right now? Yeah, right now. Yeah, sure. I'll grab us some punch. So, you and Valerie, huh? Can you believe it? Yeah, with those dance moves... Yeah, he is. No, that's not true. That... That can't be true. What's not true? Brooke just told me how she overheard your cousin talking about what you've been doing. Have you really been trying to cheat me out of the farm? No, it's not like that. Okay... how was it, then? Tell me. Well, maybe in the beginning, but, I mean, not now. Good night. I told you I didn't like these people. We're going to get you back to the city, where you know you can't trust anyone. Why are you leaving, Jen? Go back to bed, Abby, okay? Are you mad at me? No. No, of course, I'm not. Is it my daddy? Your daddy... is a good guy. He's a really good guy. Sometimes, grown-ups do just dumb things. All of us. Then I don't think I ever want to grow up. I made this for you. Abby... I wish you didn't have to go. She's not the only one. You go on back to bed now, honey. I'll come tuck you in. Goodbye, Jen. Are you sure you want to do this? I have to. Well, at least talk to Brett before you go, give him a chance to explain. Can I ask you something, Rosie? Did you know? [Sighs] It's okay. You don't have to say anything. Thank you anyway. Okay. Look, there's probably nothing I can say to make this right. But I need you to understand that I didn't do this to hurt you. When it started, it seemed like the only thing I could do. Then you became part of us. You became part of our lives. By the time I realized that, I was too stubborn to own it. And for that, I am deeply sorry. I'm sorry, too. I just... I need some time. You know, to figure all this out. Sometimes, they say it's easier if you don't have to do it alone. [Lawyer]: That's the bank's final offer. It's certainly not as much as we were hoping for... No. But it's a start. Okay, here we go. [Brooke]: Don't sign it! Don't sign it! Don't sign it! Don't sign it! Okay! Brooke, what're you doing? Saving you from making the biggest mistake of your life. Brooke, what are you talking about? This cream of yours. I tried it. You were right, it's amazing. So I had a guy in the cosmetics lab at my company try to figure out the ingredients. There is something in the earth at your farm, some special mineral or something that must get into the pumpkins. That's what makes this stuff work. The thing is, we can't figure out why, but it doesn't work anywhere else except at your farm. My farm. Exactly. The CEO of my company wants the formula and the copyright, and is willing to pay. How much? -Whoa. -That much. So, where's grandma's secret recipe? [Jen]: Good evening, everyone! [Cheering] Welcome! On behalf of Jarrett Farms Incorporated, we would like to thank you for coming to the launch of our new Harvest Moon health and beauty line. As most of you know, we've worked very hard on these products for over a year now, and I would just like to take a moment to acknowledge some of the people that are responsible for all of it happening. First, my very good friend, Brooke Schrafft, and vice president of marketing. My management directors, Lou and Phil. Our Vice President of production, Aunt Rosie. And to our superintendent of technical services, who I'm sad to say will be leaving us for greener pastures... But I'm happy to say that it will be on full musical scholarship. Harry Jarrett. [Cheering] And now I'd like to introduce to you all someone who is very, very important in my life. He has showed me that courage, even in the hard times, is the most valuable thing that you can give your child. Even more valuable than a trust fund... My father, William Stone. [Cheering] And now, last but definitely not least, I would like to thank a very special man. Over the last year, he has helped me discover strengths within myself that I never knew existed. He has taught me that the most important thing that you can do in your life is to mend a fence. And he has made me believe that inside every city girl, there's just a little bit of country aching to get out. My co-CEO and my best friend, Brett Jarrett. Come on! And now, in honor of the Harvest Moon Festival, I'd like to announce that we are bringing back an old tradition, one that I hope you all will enjoy with us for many more years to come, the coronation of the Pumpkin Princess! [Cheering] Happy Harvest Moon Festival, everybody! Have fun! Come on! [] [] Stars in the sky bird on the wing you and I got a song to sing about life is good hearts are free you take the night and you... You make it sweet oh, yeah you make it sweet oh, yeah you make it sweet... So last year, you broke your knee, and now this year, your wrist? ...little rain's bound to fall times of trouble gonna find us all maybe blue turns to gray a smile can chase the clouds away and it's a long road but I know that we're gonna make it... [] It seems like the Harvest Moon Festival is a hit. Yeah. You know, I think deep down, people really like traditions. You know, speaking of tradition... There's an old one in my family. When you find someone that you love... You ask them to marry you... I really like that tradition. ...and it's a long road but I know... That we're gonna make it you make it sweet oh, yeah you make it sweet oh, yeah you make it sweet
