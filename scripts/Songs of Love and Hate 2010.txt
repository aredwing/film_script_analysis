Common! Let's continue! OK we're coming What's worse: slaving away here or going to school? - School, obviously. - Peasant! Come here! Fetch! Hi! Have you asked? - Will you ask? - Yes, sure. Hey! Are you nuts? Idiot! Will you wait for me? No, I have to help in the vineyard See you We'll leave them a couple more days. Are you sure? Yes. We'll do a more selective sort. If you say so. We'll pick them as late as possible. Well! Hello there! Is your Fabio also so impetuous? More like a leech. - A leech? - Yep. Can't shake him off. As I said: a leech And...? Have you already done it? Little Nosey Parker! Buzz off! Come here! Sit, Prinz! And You may only lick. Lick, I said! How stupid he is! He's doing it! We could use the back stairs again to go up to the rooms. I talked with Brenner. There shouldn't be a problem. The maximum load will be 200 kg per square meter. Larger windows would be nice too, but the authorities will be against it. - Probably. - What about the roof? The first on the list. But the interior has to be renovated. A bigger room for me? Sure, princess If our Chardonnay is a hit It can't be marketed yet. It could still mature. Where's the problem? I don't mind my small room, after all. I'm going upstairs. Prinz! Prinz! He's mad! What's up with him? Come on! - Hi! - Hi! Give me some Wonderful! Cheers! No one else will drink it. - Did you notice? - What? Your turn. Rico? Look! Over there! - Watch out, Brivio! - Sorry, Raber. - Everything OK? - Sure I am. Stop trivializing! - It's driving me nuts. - Get off it! No, I don't think it's right. Lilli's becoming too impudent. Let's see what she has to say. Say to what? Say hello first. Hello. Where have you been? Yes, it's a bit late, but Fabio accompanied me home. Lillie! What? You've been smoking again! Lillie Leave some for the others. By the way You were just the same I knew you'd say that. Where are you going? To the loo. May I? You won't go to the party! - Hey, old skunk! - What's the problem? Fabio will come and get me. Wow. Crazy Come with us! - Mom lets you go? - Sure! Fabio! What kind of party is it? A school gig, for all the students. Lilli'd be back by 1 a.m. - Could Robi come with you? - Sure! I can bring them both back at 0.30 a.m. Lillie, Fabio's here. - Robi! - Oh no Hey! Robi is here! Robi Mobi! Look who's here!

Prinz! Dad! I don't know, he s slipped ...or he jumped, somehow But why would he? He simply jumped into the water Lillie, it was only an accident. Maybe he thought I was going to play with him? Hey...! It wasn't me that killed him! I'm out of here. Don't want to be part of this crap. - Is Ronny in? - Ronny! Yes? Hi! What's wrong with his nose? No idea. He doesn't talk about it.
