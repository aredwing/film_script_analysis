Yeah, I have business with youth. It's an errand. Starting tonight, watch over Bro's property for 2 or 3 days. Don't make a fool of me. Don't make a fool of me. Damn it. This, this kind of errand suits you. Hey, here's a map, a key, and some tape. Be on the lookout tonight. Start watching it right now. Hey, hey, the woman's come back! I leave it to you! Hee-hee! Kiyoshi, what are you doing out here? Never mind that. You wanna do it? I dunno, Kiyoshi. You're not fast enough for me... They call unwanted sex "rape" these days! Kiyoshi? You know that the artist Harima's house has become the director's, right? But it seems the bastard still keeps fuckin' going in and out, even though he was thrown out. This is important property that we can use in our dealings. If he does something funny to it, the value will go down. There are three days left until the final day of construction. Be on the lookout until then. You go, and if it seems like Harima is in the house, kick his ass out. - Also, this tape should automatically self-destruct. - Who the hell was that? Some "Scar People" member. He always tells me not to make a fool out of them! Vita's always such an asshole, acts like he owns the world... Does he think I'll shoot HIM by mistake? Come on! He sounds hilarious. They like to keep us in the dark. But whatever, it doesn't matter. It's like I always say: just do your job! Do you say that? What's the matter? The Mu are coming... The Muuu... How far have they come? The Mu... They have 20 km to go... That's close... This could just be a rehearsal... That'd be a real shame. What do you mean? This Replicant is half-dead already! Unless that's what they want us to think... Who are they, really? - Possibly enemies, trying to trap us. - Fine, then let's get to Bro's. - Wait! - What now? - It's dead. - It's dead?! The signal went out totally. It did? Well, that's just great! You just lost 10 grand, baby! My fees are well worth 10,000. We can STILL collect the Replicant's body. Ugh, what a smell... Who are you!? Ouch! What did you come here for? This isn't a place for kids to come to. Go call Tamio. That hurts... fuck, that hurts! 'Fuck you'! Stop already. He's covered in a lot of Guernica's powder. Death powder is a powerful powder that causes a special effect just by breathing it in. Incredible... unbelievable! Moesa, help me! Get back! My name is Guernica. I am 1.7 meters tall, or 5'7". I weigh 49 kilos, or 108 pounds. I run at a bandwidth of 120 kHz. An Android of the 90's, I was created by Dr. Loo. # I built myself an android, the world's first femdroid! # # Enjoy the true face of the 90's, humans girls are Replicants! # # She's beautiful! She's mechanical! Oh baby I, I, I... # # Oh Baby, it was me! I built her! I built her myself! # Hey, Harima, I'm leaving Guernica in your care. Whether or not she can become human depends on you. It's greater than human love. Show the android love that will become memories. This is off the record, but Guernica's life will only last for 4 years. But when her body dies, it will become powder that can transfer life to other things. Isn't that incredible? I've loved enough for a hundred years... Bro... this powder... it's incredible! Until now, I've never seen you before. My bad, bro... I got carried away... I've fallen prey to temptation. Ugh! I... I can't judge something so great! Tamio... I'm sorry, bro... Tamio... I'm sorry... Tamio... Tamio! Wait just a bit longer, Tamio! Hey, Tamio? I wish I could offer you something, but I don't have the money just yet. You know I'm good for it, don't you, Tamio? Come on, Tamio, you can trust me! Don't say his real name! Call him "hacker"! He's #1. #1 of the Scar People. I'll say it one more time: he is "hacker". Don't call him by his real name. I won't do it! You don't have to put on a big show threatening me, just over the money you lent me! Hey, Tamio! Tamio, you have my word! I'll get you all of your money. Hey, Tamio? I'm counting on you! Out of my way, asshole! Don't say his real name! He is "hacker". Listen up: this is an important time for the scar people. We need money. Next month is too late. Now! We need the money now. We're not just depending on your money, but for how many years have we supported an artist who can't sell anything?! Now that we're in a bind, common sense says you should help us, even if you have to bust your ass. Go pawn those unsellable pictures in bulk! If that's still no good, then sell your studio! You've taught me much. Now that I can love as a human, I am closer to BEING human. The life that you have given me was an invaluable capsule of humanity. Hacker will take that capsule of information... He wants to take it in lieu of the money you owe him. Before that can happen, I will die in this house. We won't have to hide that capsule anymore. Very soon... it will all be over. Gah!? What was that just now? Kiyoshi, what's the big idea? Ah, bro... Don't come... What are you saying, Kiyoshi? Put Harima on the line! Bro... Amazing, you're speaking. Take me to Harima's place! Bro! No, don't come! Ruins of Dr. Loo's Lab But, at the same time, the powder brings about an incredible effect. It can probably even become the very essence of life. People who will start a war over that powder will probably show up. Be careful. Be very careful, so that Guernica doesn't die. It all depends on your love. Bro... don't come... You'll be killed by me... Harimaa... How dare you fuck up a man's property like this?! Harimaa... Harimaaa...!! Harima! Kiyoshi! You knew that from the beginning...? Stop... I'll be using this body. I'll be living through your body. That was just the memory of Guernica... Not me... You knew it would come to this from the beginning? Cut it out! I knew about this from before... I feel so... refreshed. Yo, bro. Harima has helped me out so much. I'm really in his debt... Thanks to him, I've made a full recovery. Bro, please personally give Harima a token of thanks. Hey, Kiyoshi! What the fuck are you saying...? Kiyoshi! Put Harima on the line! Hey, Kiyoshi! Kiyoshiiiii! Kiyoshiiiii! Looks like he's woken up... His face has gone back to being pretty... He's probably become Guernica, on the inside. No way, it's Kiyoshi, just as he was. Hey, Guernica...! Guernica!! ...it's okay now... Liar! It's okay. He's not dead... I'm using this body. Whoa, you can fuse two lives together? I don't know... It's the first time, so I don't know what will happen... It's okay for now.... Wait, a car is coming! It's a war, huh... Yeah... For your sake, you who are more than human... I'm receiving Guernica, after we finish them off. Hmph! If you can do it, then go ahead and try. You saw the powder phenomenon, right? I'm a bounty hunter. The Mu are coming... The Muuu... How far have they come? The Mu... They have 20 km to go... That's close... They've come!! I'm going to call the contact number. Geez... Hello, I have a package from Katoba's Father Delivery. Is this Harima Kensetsu? Please, let us in! Do as you like. You'll all die anyway. What...?! He hung up! What do I do now? Got it! ...a Replicant... ...loved enough for a... ...witness the conception... An Android of the 90's, I was created by Dr. Loo. I am 1.7 meters tall, or 5'7". I weigh 49 kilos, or 108 pounds. I run at a bandwidth... of 120 kHz... I knew it would come to this, from the beginning... KentaiFilms, lordretsudo
