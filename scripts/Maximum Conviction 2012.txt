So it is. Sorry, boys, there's been a delay. Where the fuck's Bradley? He's taking care of shit at the airport. We've got a flight to Mexico City to catch. Negative. We've got a delay. Why don't you guys hole up in town for a little bit? There's a nice little bar there. We'll meet you at 1800 hours. Got it. I'll tell Bradley to meet us there. Until then. ( Both chuckle) -( distant prisoners shouting ) -( gate buzzes ) Mm, Fields. Here you go. Nice. Hell, something smells good there. Mm-hmm. The woman sure can cook. You got yourself a lady in the kitchen? Maybe. Well, the way you're eating that burrito, you should marry her. -( laughs ) - Why not? Nobody cooks that good, man. Yeah, but you'd have someone to go home to every night. Think about it. I'd just get bored. Yeah, well, being bored, that's the secret, I think-- bored, but being happy, like me. You're happy? Yeah. Don't I look happy? An exciting life is a good way to get yourself killed. Remember that. - You heard? - All right. Hey, you want one? No way. ( Knocks ) ( lock beeps, door opens ) How are you doing? Man: Open it up. (guards conversing ) HSO team just rolled in. I said we'd meet them in 10, at 1300. Yeah, but oddly enough, transport still hasn't shown up. We're waiting on the marshals again. We're waiting on the fucking bus? Guess so. God damn it. I still can't believe I let you convince me to come here to shut down a couple of bullshit buildings. I usually make the mess, brother. You got me cleaning this one up. See, the thing of it is, you're getting old, man. I got to let you down easy. But the thing of it is, when I want somebody to cover my back, you're my man. All our guys- they're the best. The way I look at it, you'll be down in Mexico in the next few days and there's 4,000 ways to get killed down there, so watch your ass. Thanks for trying to cheer me up. ( laughs) Last time was a real clusterfuck, wasn't it? - Lost some damn good men. - Yeah. Army brass should have never pulled us out of that shithole. Man, why do you act so surprised? That's the way all these highfalutin military pricks is, man. - You know that. -( gate buzzes ) We're the first guys that they piss on. Anyway, next week you'll get some payback, man. And speaking of pricks... Every time I get another stack of bullshit paperwork, your fingerprints are all over it, Cross. Yeah, I thought your job was bullshit paperwork. - Shut up. - Negative, Warden. I ain't got to shut up. Go hide behind your desk. We're done here. - No, you're not. - We kind of are, man, 'cause this bitch is fully decommissioned. I took us off the grid, man-- computers, satellites, phones- everything. Transport will be here soon to get the detainees. We're done. No, you booked in two more high-security assets last night. You reopened block D right after you and Manning permanently shut it down. See, you have to understand something- this is a black site, specifically designed for people of interest. No, no, no, it was a black site, Cross-- was. You security contractors- you're all the same. You think you're hot shit ex-soldiers, big fucking heroes. Well, you're a pain in my ass. We already had four people of special interest here. We don't have enough MP-s to legally hold all the fucking interesting people we got, let alone the two who came in last night. When you signed those two in last night, you took authority over them. That means signing them out will be your job, not mine. I would enjoy the process. Well, the transfer unit's late, so you're going nowhere till all the detainees have cleared the gate on the way out. ( Gate buzzes ) ( prisoners shouting ) Step away from the bars. Detainees, step back. Let me out! Detainees, step back. (man screams) What the fuck? Fucking liars! I'm gonna fucking kill you guys! I'll fucking kill you all! Chow. Bring him in. Fuck you. I'm not eating that shit. Don't ever touch me. Code red. Backup in the courtyard. Repeat, backup in the courtyard! Code red. Fucking killers! ( Man shouting ) Open the courtyard gate. Open the courtyard. ( Gate buzzes ) What's the problem, man? What's the problem? Inmate: Come on, man. Want something? (grunting ) Boss. Okay, boss. - You all right? - Fuck you. Sir, I found this kite in the corridor. I don't know if the inmates are trying to communicate, but I thought you should know. All right. Be cool. I'ma get you. Fuck you. I'ma get you. Let me see that. ( Gate buzzes ) Whoa. The name on the manifest says Rick. The name tag says Max. You want to explain that? The truck rolled over his foot yesterday. Um, I usually work dispatch. Short-staffed, so... Almost wrapped up here, so let's get it done. Sorry, you know, I was trying to sneak in a bit of overtime. Wife's birthday, you know, coming up. Why don't we catch up some other time, all right? Just get on with your job so I can get the fuck out of here. Manning: Sanders, guard the fort. (machine whirring) ( metal squeaking ) ( metallic rattling ) - Don't tell me you fucked this up. - I don't know. All you had to do was push a goddamn button. Sounds like something snapped. Something snapped? Is that your professional opinion or just a wild fucking guess? Shit, I'm gonna die of old age in this motherfucker. Get the truck, pull it out. We need to take a look. Pull it out. (engine starts) Kill it. Kill it. -( Engine stops) - I'm smelling diesel out here. The truck won't disengage. Something's definitely stuck back there. You might want to call your buddies to come down here and give you some help. ( Chuckles ) Yeah, good luck with that. Friday night-- everyone's packed out till Monday. Manning: Shit. I got it. I'll see what I can do. (gate buzzes, lock clicks) Hey, bud, it's Manning. Hey, listen, we've got an issue with the garbage truck. Something's jammed in there and I'm smelling diesel fumes. Well, you know, block D is on the same ventilation system as maintenance. Yes, sir, same place you booked in two assets last night. Fuck. I'm gonna head down there right now. Anyway, I'll take care of it. I don't think either of us is gonna make it out of here tonight. Wonderful. I was about to contact you on the radio, sir. I'm smelling diesel down here. Yeah, I know. I'm moving the detainees as we speak. - Where are we gonna put them? - Unfortunately, block G. Seriously? Those fucking guys are gonna go crazy when they know about them. Unfortunately, I don't have much of a choice. You know, it's only for a couple of hours. Everybody's transferring out tonight. So let's just do it. All right, girls, let's go for a walk. Let's see your hands, girls. Woman: Please listen to me. I'm a foreign national. My government has no idea where I am. Cross: Right. And you're a political prisoner. I know. I've heard that before, man. Every motherfucker in here that's wrapped in skin is a political prisoner. I'm no idiot, okay? I know what this place is and I know where guys like you come from. If you don't help me, then I'm dead. Went in the boiler room, grabbed some tools. I went ahead and shut the heat down to G block while I was there, FYI. Sure got some ugly janitors in this dump. - Who let the hooker in? - Fuck you. I did. You deal with your mess. I've got a garbage truck with my name on it waiting for me. Call me. It was CIA this time. Please listen to me. Look, I'm a courier. My contact was assassinated right in-- Cross: In private. Woman: This time it was CIA. -( Men jeering ) - Look, I'm not bullshitting you. I'm trying to tell you that if you don't listen to me, if you don't help me, then I'm dead. I'm-- Cross: You just gotta stop talking in front of people. Manning: Please tell me you know what the hell you're doing in there. Cross: What's your ETA, man? It's gonna be a while. The prisoners are locked and secured in block G. I'm meeting the team. I've got something to run by Bradley. Radio me if the transfer unit shows up. Will do. Well, fuck me. Man, we ain't never getting out of here at this rate. I'll take a look. Man over radio: Target in place. Commence extraction. ( Blues music playing ) Man: Come on, boss, have a drink. These ladies have been waiting for you and Manning all day. Oh, thank you. Cross: Where the hell is Bradley? I gotta get back to the base. Bradley: Hey, sorry I'm late. So where's Manning? I thought he was coming with you. He's fucking around with that trash compressor or some shit. And he's happy about it too. Sol heard you might have something for me. I've got a kite that they seem to have recovered from one of the inmates, but I got a funny feeling that this looks like numeric and Arabic mixed. And Arabic is your deal, so have a look at that and I'll come down in a minute. Yeah, that's exactly what it is. As you know, ciphers are numeric-based, but the Arabic is unusual. Fortunately, it's one of my specialties. Hey, the wagon finally arrived. Looks like we're out of here in the morning. Control unit to Manning: transfer unit has arrived. Copy? Control unit to Manning, transfer unit has arrived. Copy? Man: Manning is still working on the crusher. I'll let him know when he comes out. Guard: Let's get Terrence on it. Terrence, this is Control. We need you in intake. The transfer unit is here. Copy? Terrence: On my way. Wait here. ( Blues music playing ) It's complicated, but my best guess is that a dirty guard has been passing on information. That's basically an itinerary. It gives the exact pickup time and the route the marshals are going to. Okay, so what we're talking about is a high-risk extraction in the making, and it's coming soon. We have little time. Where is your gear? The gear's still at the airport. I didn't think we'd need it. Well, always gotta be ready, right? Listen, I'm gonna go brief Manning and jump up ahead of you guys. You guys go tack up. Meet me there. Go in the tunnels off the motor pool and nobody will see you. Keep your eyes open, your head on a swivel. Okay. All right, gentlemen, we got a fucking shit sandwich coming on real fast. We need to tack up now. - Let's go. - All right. -" Happy days are here... .' All right, let's see what you got. I don't think you can handle what I got. Come on, bring it. Oh, damn! Now, see, that was pure luck. A pro would never take that shot. Captain Christopher Blake, US marshal, prisoner transfer unit. You got two female detainees for me. Man over P.A.: Personnel, be advised, please remember to catalogue all boxes according to the official government itemized checklist. How's your Friday night? Yeah, this all seems in order, but there's only transfer papers for two prisoners. That's what it says-- Samantha Mendez and Charlotte Walker. Problem? I heard you were supposed to move all six. That's news to me. Well, I can't authorize this anyway. You're gonna have to talk to the warden. Take Marshal Blake to see the warden. I'm gonna call Esmeralda, see if she can stay late in the kitchen and get you boys fed. You two stay here. You're with me. Clear. I've been through that thing from top to bottom. Nothing's wrong with the crusher. Gotta be the goddamn truck. Fire that son of a bitch back up. -( Knocks on door) - What? I said what? ls everybody deaf around here? Warden, Captain Christopher Blake, US Marshal, Prisoner Transfer Unit. You have two female detainees for me to pick up. Well, I sympathize with your predicament, Marshal, but it seems that nobody has any concern for mine. I got a schedule to keep. You got the documentation. I'm not asking you for any favors. The detainees are going from a military to a federal facility. Your paperwork requires the correct signature. It doesn't happen to be mine. We can fix the paperwork. Warden, I'm working in cooperation with the CIA. They have a special interest in these two detainees. - Bring it. - Want some of this? Huh? Huh? - I don't think you do. - Come on. - Oh! - Oh. See? - Want a coffee, loser? - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. - Hey, two sugars this time. Sure. You lift me up and carry me away...  Put in manual access, back in a minute. ( Gate opens ) - Cross: D-436, anybody. -( punches landing, men grunting) This is headquarters. D-436, anybody. This is headquarters. This is MP Terrence Davis, sir. What's your status? Davis: The transfer unit just arrived. They're talking to the warden. They only had the paperwork to transfer two detainees. Where's Manning? Davis: Still dealing with the garbage issue, sir. All right, look, man, nobody moves. Wait till I get there. Do not release the PIs. Do not release the prisoners. Nobody moves till I get there. Davis: Copy that, sir. Sounds like a vibrator my wife used to have. Keep rigging it. Something's gonna snap. No fucking shit. That's the idea. I want to break whatever's in there. I'm not staying in this son of a bitch all night. CIA can shove their gratitude up their ass. Cross signed them in on his authority. You need his signature to get them out. I'm not here to make your life easier. Boy, you got that right. So where the fuck are they? (song continues on radio) (humming along) Hey. Put the coffees down. Sit in the chair and open the doors I tell you to open when I tell you to open them, and nobody gets hurt. Fuck you. What? Wait, no. (gunshot) Begin phase two. That's our signal. On your feet. Light it up. ( Chuckles ) It's working again. Ready to charge now. Everyone stand back. Charge, one minute. What's that noise? Time to charge. Ready? Fire in the hole. Fuck. Password, password, password. What the fuck is the password? It's inside the crusher. - Man: Clear the blast zone. - Clear! Get down. This is Terrence, sir. I don't know about Manning, but I just heard an explosion. (siren wailing) Secured? If the MP and the security guard are dead, then, yeah, we're secured. Good. Driver: Easy payday. Why don't we get the girl? Where are they? I don't know what you're talking about. Who the fuck do you think I'm talking about? The two that were brought in here last night. Oh, yes. I can tell you. They're in-- they're in-- Where are they, God damn it? Cross reopened block D. Block D. Light up cell block D. I want to be out of here in 15 minutes. COPY- It's that way. Control, can you see us? I see you. Hold. What's the problem? I don't know, man. He must have put it on manual when I came in. I need the fucking password. I need your password to open doors. I don't have a password. Then I'm gonna find someone who does. Please, no. Control room-- in the control room, there's a fingerprint scanner on the board. It gives me access to all the sensitive systems in an emergency. Warden: What are you gonna do? Move, God damn it. What finger? Warden: No. - Which finger? - No! (screams) This finger? My finger- you cut my finger off. Fuck. - Do I need to cutoff another one? - Please, please. I can take you there. There's 50 keys here. I know which ones to use. Let me show you. It'll be faster. Please don't kill me. Please. Suit yourself. Blake over radio: Control, I'm on my way. I've got access to the board. - Let's go. - Okay. This one MP, This one MP, the security guy-- Manning- looked like ex-special ops, a big, bald asshole. No offense. Just find them. Confirm that they're dead. (siren continues wailing ) Here's one of them. - That's him! Waste him! -( rapid gunfire) Secure the area. Max, with me. One more idiot play like that and I'll blow your head off myself. (steam hissing ) ( door slams ) (rapid gunfire) ( bones crack) (rapid gunfire) ( door slams ) The main gate to the holding area is secure. Who are you? Special Agent Watkins. I have an appointment with the warden about some kind of narcotics activity here. We're doing a high-risk security transfer here. We're gonna have to ask you to leave. All right. Fields over radio: Team two. Respond, team two. All right, head up, Bradley. We've got active hostiles up in here. Bradley: 10-4. En route. Fields: Team two, respond. (two gunshots) Fields over radio: We have another issue. How many parts of your job have you managed to fuck up today? Not me. Team two has been compromised. What's the damage? Terminated. Got some guy coming in through prisoner intake, came out of nowhere. Whoa, whoa. Fields: He's changed into full tactical. This guy means business. Shit. Let's go. Control, we got a security expert on the loose-- Manning-- conversant in special ops. He went through the south boiler. Can you track him? Fields: Don't see him. He must be off the grid. I need access now, or I'm gonna start blowing doors. And track Manning. He's bad news. Blake: Stand down, Collins. That's an order. Your priority is the target in cell block D. Fields, do you have a visual? Nothing but empty cell blocks. Blake: What about the rest of the prison? Nothing. We have two internal MP-s in the ultra max sector, no threat. No visual on the target. Blake: Find her. - It's this way. - Let's go. Yo, the guy from the cell blocks is moving. Blake: Track him. Let me know if he stumbles into our kill zone. We'll isolate and extract him after we've secured the target. You understand? Fields: Copy. (engine revs) ( tires screech ) Cross's last radio transmit said there were active hostiles. At this stage, we have to assume it's an extraction. We've got minimal gear and ammo, so we go in quiet through the old hydro-access tunnels. We make every shot count. We good? - Yeah. - Let's go. Blake: Come on. ( Door buzzes ) Intel on the target. What the fuck happened to you? They needed some convincing. Target confirmed. The location of the data is unknown so far. Shit. Open the doors to L block. ( Buzzes ) We have guests. Blake: Fuck. Ready? Three, two one. Who the hell are those guys? Who the fuck are they? Cross and Manning were waiting for a team, the HSO team I think they called it. Why were they waiting for a high-speed operating team? Cross-- that's the guy in holding- he's a private contractor, trains teams like that, one of those shadow guys, ex-Special Forces. He came in to shut down the site, brought in Manning. Collins, we have an intrusion in the motor pool-- a three-man HSO team. Stand by. I'm gonna shut off the power in the cell blocks. Get your people in there now. Collins: 10-4. Team one, sweep sector seven, kill everyone. Teams two and three, set up perimeter defenses. My team, tight to me. Let's move. (device squealing ) Motherfucker. Boo. God damn, it's getting funnier every time I do it. Yeah, well, see if I come to save your ass next time. Save my ass? Fuck. Well, I'm glad to see you're still breathing. - So what have we got? - I made contact with those assholes. They're after one of the female detainees. Sounded like she had some info somebody wanted. - So where's Cross? - Fucked if I know. He's not with you? No, he said he'd meet us up here. They'll be going after him. We need to assess enemy strength, engage, kill, clear access for him. He'll find us. You got gear? Not much. Hand it over. A little more effective than a screwdriver. A screwdriver worked on you, didn't it? Yeah. You need to wake up. No sign of him. Hallway clear. Go, go. They're gonna sweep past on a perimeter check. They know we're here. We need to get off this video grid and buy some real estate. Move. Hold up. Man: I think I see something. Manning: Contact, 12. Man: I hear them. They should be right through this door. (gunfire) Man: Move it! Clear. Clear. Dead check. Okay, stay tight. Grab the radio. We can track their movements. Got it. -( Steam hissing ) -( rhythmic banging) Got Cross again. You said these guys were ex-Special Forces? Yeah. The background is Cross is an operational genius and Manning's a weapons expert, a bulldozer on the ground. I guarantee when they find each other, we'll be facing a coordinated assault. Collins, you have got to ramp it up and get it done. Divert more men to sector seven now. Collins: There's no MPs. Where are the prisoners? Fields: Should be near the door. They're not here. Please, no, no, no. Tell me where she is, or I'm done being nice. Oh, God, I don't-- I overheard Cross and Manning on the radio, a security thing. Because of the garbage truck, they must have moved them. Where? Where? There's only one other open block. G block, go. (metal groaning) Terrence, are you still there? Terrence: Yes, sir. Do you want me to meet you? No, sit tight and keep your head down or it will probably get blown off. Copy that. - Esmeralda, come on. - What's going on? - We have to hide, come on. - No. No. We have to stay low. You have to stay quiet. - Okay, this way, then. This way. - No, no, this way, come on. - Let go of me. - Esmeralda, look, I will keep you safe. I promise. - Okay? ' Okay Come on. There you go. Shh. (distant gunshot) (distant rapid gunfire) ( men shouting ) Man: Where are you going? What's going on? Man: Where are you going? What's going on? Sorry. I just didn't want any friendly accidents. Cross, it's me. What's going on? It's a targeted extraction. They're killing anybody they see, so we want to kill them first, you hear? - So we should get the hell out of here. - Negative. If somebody comes, I'll lay down cover fire - and buy you time. - Do it. All right, watch your partners' backs. They're gonna try to track me on security cams, so if you can pin them down, buy me some time. Man: Hey, what's going on out there? ( Pounding ) Fuck, what's going on? Man: What the hell? ( Men continue shouting ) Jesus, finally. You took long enough. I went over your file. I've been in this game long enough to know that someone has phonied it up. You still think I'm crazy? Which means probably someone wants you dead. If you listen to me, do what I say, I'll kill them before they kill you, you hear? Now, I don't know exactly how you fit in this picture. I'm assuming either you're with them or you're with me. The long and the short is, do what I say, be smart-- you'll do well. If you don't listen to me and I find for one reason or another you're with them or you make a false move, I'll kill you just like I kill them. We cool? All right, come on over to my left. You stay on my right, stay a little bit behind me, and let's go. (rapid gunfire) You three, with me. You two, take out the MP and sweep the block for the target. Go. Man: Section G clear. Open all the doors in G block. Lock everything else down. I want my men to have a clear run in there. Warden: You can't do that. That sector houses high-risk detainees. You can't let those animals out. - Blake: Do it. - You got it. ( Buzzes ) ( laughs) So what's your story? I'm a courier for a non-US intelligence agency. Sometimes I work with friendlies and sometimes enemies, but all of it off the official radar. My contact on my last drop was a CIA op. So how did you get here? Well, my contact was assassinated and then all channels went dark. I got away and then I got picked up. And then I ended up here. Now I got one message from my handlers- to sit tight because there was some kind of internal problem-- and then nothing. We'll talk about that. Let's keep moving. Cross: Hold up. Don't move. Don't breathe. (device squealing ) What's up? Mines. Cut one of the beams, they go off. We can't go that way. Follow me. Man: Corridor six clear. Heading to the rendezvous point. (rhythmic banging) So do you know who killed your contact? It felt like a CIA kill squad. I've seen them do the thing a dozen times. It was classic. So they were trying to isolate you and retrieve information. What are you carrying? You tell me. You know the drill. They don't tell me anything. They upload the information onto an implant. It's usually military intelligence. Where's the implant? It's right there. Yeah, I've seen those before. You can upload and download data via a short-range transmission, but the chip also monitors the electrical impulses of your heart. The problem is if you get killed, it wipes the intel. Are the police at least gonna come and help us? Sweetheart, this is a top secret military dark facility. The police do not know about this place, never could, never will. But you don't have to worry, 'cause if somebody tries to come and kill you, they gotta come through me and my friends. What's that noise? Pipes, man. They run all the way through the prison. The inmates use them to communicate. I have an MP held up in the kitchen. He's trying to let us know he's all right. Man: Hey, boss man. Charlotte, get over here. Now get down. Hey, boss man. We know you got some women back there. Just give us one. We'll take our frustrations out on her. Or you could fuck her yourself and just give us your keys. Cross: I got a better idea. Why don't you fuck your mama and one of your pet poodles? (gunfire) They found the weapons. - Does that hurt? - Yeah. You fucking pussy. I have the asset and confirmation of the chip implant and location. Cross is right behind me. Get to the extraction point. How do you want me to do that? I'm lost. You see where she is? What's the quickest way to the garbage room? It's hard to say. If you want to keep on breathing, you'd better figure it out. From where she is, she'd have to go through the kitchen and then skirt B and C blocks. Collins, we have the asset. She's being pursued by Cross towards the kitchen in your sector. Take out Cross, rendezvous with Charlotte, and get her to the extraction point. Rendezvous with Collins in the kitchen. We'll open the doors. Head to the kitchen. Happy to see a familiar face? Manning, contact, 12. Pull back. Pull back. Hold your fire. Having fun yet? Fuck, I'm having a blast. We've been clearing these motherfuckers as we find them. They're heading for the kitchen. You want to hit that bitch together? I'd love to, but unfortunately they're too mobile. She'll be gone before we get there. I need to hit the control room. Now I can track her from there. We've got time, 'cause they can't kill her yet. Clear. Another little problem- we have one of the MP-s held up in the kitchen and the bad guys are headed that way. Shit. Poor motherfucker ain't got a chance. - Let me see what I can do. - Yes, sir. You guys, I want you to sweep up the rear, make sure Manning's six is clear. I'll radio when I hit the target. All right, let's do it. Do you think anyone heard your signals? - ( Whispers ) - No, wait. Blake: Kitchen, I have movement by cold storage. ( Rustling ) -( Esmeralda screams) - Shut up. Bring them over here now. It's Terrence-- an MP. Tell Cross and Manning everything is clear down here. Tell them you have the girl. This is Terrence. We are in the kitchen. Terrence: It's a trap. Mayday, Mayday! - No! - ( two gunshots) Collins: We have the asset. Blake: Get her out of the kitchens. Send her to the extraction point. Collins: Copy that. Blake: Contact, I have movement. Looks like Manning's coming through your sector. Where? Blake: I lost him. He's got to be there somewhere. Extraction in 10 minutes. Fan out. Mess with me, I'll gouge your eyes out with my fingers. (screams) (screaming ) (two gunshots) Make a noise, you die. Hey, are you okay? You like that shit? What the fuck, baby? Holy shit. My kind of woman. ( Gasps ) You think you're going to enjoy yourself, baby cakes? I don't. - ( Screams ) - I'm gonna take good care of you. No! No. No! No. No! Shut up, bitch! Please stop. Please stop. You're gonna- you're gonna like it. Oh, yeah. No! ( laughs) Blake: Where's the asset? We've been in here too long already. We have to move. Working on it. No. No. Come here. (Samantha exclaiming) No. No. No. Hey, fuckhead, over here. Fresh meat. Yes, bitch? (screaming ) Bitch! Back to business. I'm gonna give you something to think about. See, you're lucky. I was gonna kill you and cut the chip out. But now I know I can't do that. It's a good thing I didn't fuck up Cross before I found out. So you're not gonna die just yet, not before I get that data scanned out of you. When I do, guess where I'm gonna stick this? ( Stick clatters ) Got the bitch. What's the situation? Let's bounce. Open everything-- all doors. Get out of there and meet me at the extraction point with the asset. Garbage room-- show me. Now. Come on, come on. I should have known you were a plant when they picked you up from state pen. No con fights like that. You're goddamn CIA. So what if I am? So you're supposed to be on my side. Says who? My contact was CIA. Why are you doing this? We both want the same things. We're both helping our countries- No, you just want to feel good about yourself and I want to get paid. You're so fucking dumb, you didn't even know what you were handing your contact before we capped him. If you did, you'd be lying on a beach somewhere by now with a different face, laughing at all of us. Too bad for you. Come on. Manning over radio: Cross, they have the target. Cross: Rendezvous with the team. We'll meet up at the extraction point in the garbage room. Charlotte, where are you? Let's go. I want that package. Getting there. They didn't give me a map when they booked me in. This wasn't supposed to be my job. Look, you hit F block, then C block. Let's move it. Move it. What the fuck happened to you? Got my ass whupped by my new girlfriend. They acquired the target. Cross will be tracking her. The extraction point is the garbage room. Cross wants to lock down all the doors, contain the extraction team. You have five minutes to meet up. Use what you can to get out. I'm gonna circle around the back, make sure they don't hit us from the rear. - All right, got it. - Move. Boys. ( Keyboard keys clicking ) Cross: Time to lock it up. It's my game now. ( Buzzing ) ( gate buzzes ) We're trapped. Blake: Where? F block, covered walkway. I've got keys, but it's gonna slow me down. Blake: We're right behind you. Move. Warden, get out your goddamn keys. Open the fucking gate. Why do you keep putting your keys away, huh? Are you clowning around with me? Huh? Are you clowning with me? Please. It's not far. Move it. Whoa. What the fuck are you guys doing, huh? Get to the extraction point now. Secure the area. Go, go. Hold it. Come on. Come on, come on, Warden. ( Gate buzzes ) Oh, fuck. All right, maintenance room should only be 100 yards from here. Let's start blowing doors. If I'm gonna die, you son of a bitch, I'm taking you with me. ( Gate buzzes ) Secure the door. Come on, jerk-off, get going. Okay, Warden, you were great. (two gunshots) Charlotte: The implant is just below her left breast. You need some kind of special scanner to get it out. Just shut the fuck up for five minutes. I've done this about 50 times. I know what I'm doing. Watch my back. ( Beeping ) I am so gonna enjoy this. Are you gonna work out or are you gonna fight? I guess we'll find out. ( laughs) No pain, no gain. That's it. I've got it. You traitor. Kill the bitch. Let's bounce. Samantha: Cross! - Charlotte: Cover. - Blake: Give me that. Isn't that the tactical genius? I got you outmanned and outgunned two to one. I guess you're not so clever after all. It ain't the amount. It's the skill. The skill the guy's got- that's what it is. Save it for your girlfriend. Want to hear something funny, though? All right. See my smiling face? It's the last thing you're gonna see before you hit your grave. Where are you going? What are you gonna do? Drop your fucking weapons! - Put them down now! Put them down! - Drop your weapons now! You motherfucker, drop it! - Drop it! Drop your weapon! -( men shouting ) ( shouts ) Cover me. I'm out. Cover him! You're dead, bitch. Keep them pinned down. I'm gonna flank them. I'll catch you long. Go, go, go. Motherfucker! I got four of them. How about you? I got some myself. Look at this sorry-ass bitch. (chuckling ) Okay. Yeah, we made it. God damn, which one of you motherfuckers killed my future ex-wife? Cross. You're out of ammo. So am I. Why don't we talk? We've got a lot in common, you and I-- Special Forces, black ops, CIA. No, I'm not Special Forces. I was never Special Forces. I was a Marine. Whatever. What the hell are we trying to kill each other for, huh? (throws down gun ) This isn't about patriotism with a flag. This is about money. (throws down gun ) You know who Samantha's contact was? It was a money guy. He delivered secret government funds to favored efforts in trouble spots around the world. He was a bag man for the CIA delivering bribes and payoffs. And that chip that was implanted in her... Yeah? That contained secret financial information. With that, we could access at least $200 million of whitewashed money- clean money. You know what you could do with that? You could open yourself a free clinic in Mogadishu or an orphanage in Mexico or a bordello in Berlin- whatever the fuck you want. Right? Yeah. You and I both know this isn't about good guys and bad guys anymore. We split that money right down the middle. You walk away a rich guy. I walk away a rich guy. Maybe you really would give me $100 million. There's your act of good faith. You know, I'm just thinking to myself that somewhere in the back of my mind, I kind of feel like you're not being completely sincere. What, you don't trust me? Not exactly. Look at you, man. You're dead. Money can't buy life. Money can't buy honor. You ain't got shit. I don't know what's wrong with you, man. Now you're dead. Argh! Jeez. You talk about being a warrior. How does a warrior break his word of honor? You know the story about the scorpion and the frog? - Yeah. - Well, that's me. I'm the fucking bad guy. Yeah? Well, I'm the good guy. Hi. You all right? (Cross laughs) Make sure that's set right. Got a long trip. Well, I need a minute with you, brother. Yeah, I got a minute. What you got? You know, this whole thing was about money- $200 million. I got the bank accounts with all the numbers right here. It's all black ops money, all off the books. Ain't nobody to give it back to. I'm giving you half. What do you want to do with it, man? Shit, probably use half of it for some paybacks. Yeah, I'd like that myself. Maybe use the other half to start up a security company, buy some toys. What the hell are you gonna do? I think I'll give half to St. Jude's in Memphis. The other half I'll use to have some fun, help some of my friends and my family. Listen, in about 43 hours, man, after you finish your thing, I was hoping you could meet me in Port D'Azul. You know that place, don't you? Yeah, I know the place. It's where we used to do the mission debriefs. What the hell are you cooking up now? I got another operation for us. I think you're gonna like it. Remember, man, it ain't over till we're dead. I hope you like to fly, baby, 'cause it's time to go. ( Instrumental music playing )
