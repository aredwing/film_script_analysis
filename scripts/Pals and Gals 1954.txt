Midway between the kneecap and the ankle joint there's an area of great congestion. This vein is the cause of all your trouble. I've never seen a vein like it in my life. It's enormous. What's the answer, Doc? I ain't gonna lose my leg, am I, Doc? I've had it ever since I was a little kid. Oh, of course not. Just go out west a couple of months and you'll be just as good as new. Oh, thanks, Doc. The leg is as good as new. It feels great. - Easy! - It's all right. We're heading west. Boy, that sawbones had the right dope. My leg feels swell. Good. What's the matter with that stuff? Give me something with a jolt in it. I'm tough! Look, we're out west now, so we've got to be tough. Don't worry about us. We'll be tough. We know what to do. Okay, boys. Get western. - Shoot you for the drink. - Right. Yeah? - Shoot you for the drink. - Throw. You throw. Hold it! Okay. Here's your change. There you are. What's the matter with you guys? What are you trying to...? Hey. Easy, easy. Smooth as silk. Those jaspers down there... Who are they? I don't know, boss. Nell, come here. Go find out who those men are. Doc Barker, I won't do it. You won't do what? You're forgetting who I got locked up down there. That's better. - He's all right. - Hello, boys. What brings you to Coyote Pass? Well, lady, it's my vein. - Your vein? - Biggest vein you ever saw. Quirt, I always knew there was gold around these parts. Now see it... It's my vein. Ain't it a whopper? It certainly is. You see, it's just halfway between... It's all very interesting, but I must go now. I want to tell you some more about my vein. You can tell me. I'm Doc Barker. Pleased to meet you, Doc. This is right up your alley. Did you ever see a vein like this in all your life? I should say not. You know something? I could do things with a vein like that. - You mean, operate? - That's right, partner. We're really gonna work on it. - No small-time stuff either. - No? If it's near the surface, we'll use 20 men with pick and shovel. Well, that might be... Listen, Doc! And if the vein is any deeper, we'll use dynamite. Oh, no! Not on my vein! The tinhorns around here will say that Doc Barker ain't a big operator. Well, they won't have a leg like to stand at. Neither will I. Oh, mister, you're a card. You kill me! Thanks anyway, Doc, but we'll handle the vein ourselves. Yeah. Come on, let's go, boys. I saw it. It's worth millions. Big operator... He ain't kidding. - What's the matter? - Come on. I've got to talk to you. Follow me. Go ahead, go ahead, come on. Doc Barker is a no good crook. He stolen the Red Dog Saloon from me and my sisters and he's left them up. Nell! - Zell, Bell! - Well, well! Maybe these gentlemen would help us. Please, let us out of here! Doc Barker said if we'll not get marry him something terrible going to happen to us.
