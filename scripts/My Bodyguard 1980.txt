I told him, "Hector, "TV is a narcotic. "It drains away your manhood if you watch it all the time." It's a drug. Exactly. A drug. There he is, a young fellow, only 67 years old, already his eyes are turning into headlights. It got to where... I practically had to drag him to bed. Well, that's what busted us up. Oh, hey... these are the Dumpys from Cincinnati. Dunphys. He makes those cute "get well" cards. She writes the verses. You got any X-rated cards? Not as yet, Mrs. Peache. Oh. Say, that looks delicious. Why don't you squeeze a little shot of lemon in there... a little zing to it. Live a little, huh? Now, where... Oh, yeah. Everything is under control. Hi, Dad. She has no access to the room keys. I can't do that. She's my mother. It was nothing more than a misunderstanding. Mm-hmm. Griffith is not the manager of this hotel. I am. Trust me, okay? 405's done. I'll finish 406 tomorrow. Tomorrow? When? After lunch. That's too late. You want miracles? Hold on. Marty, wait. - She's not in the pump room. - Oh, God. I can't be everywhere. I'm on my break. - She's in the bar. - Alone? I'm outta here. I got a union meeting. I'll call you back, okay? Bye. Where is he? As usual, we're operating like a well-oiled machine. Have time for dinner? Come on. Yes, Griffith. Mr. Peache, things are going badly. The fourth floor is a disaster. Mrs. Dunphy... alleges that her husband was propositioned by an elderly lady. And we know who that was. Senator Byrum has had his suite double-booked. Okay, I'll take care of Mrs. Dunphy and the senator, and you take care of the fourth floor. You, young man, still have to eat. I'll try and join you. Okay? Hello. Hello, miss. Have you seen a... You wouldn't be Mrs. Dunphy? For crying out loud, you were described so differently. This is your father? Bats! Bats! I'm sorry. Did I scare you? No. I saw you. You did not, you little liar. Nobody suspects a bat attack. I saw it coming a mile off. No, no. Don't you strike a woman. Men think women want that. They're wrong. Leave her before you strike her. Put that pillow down. That's it. Ow! Stop it. All right, I quit. Oh, you dirty rotten kid. You never take my advice. Look what I got you. A brand-new notebook, a pack of paper, and, uh... pens and pencils and an eraser. I always loved opening day of school. I loved going in the stationery stores. They smell so terrific. Lumberyards, too. And bookstores. Yeah. Nothing smells better than a new book. Mother! Mother. Mother... Mother. How did you know I was back there? A little heavy on theJungle Gardenia. Ooh, that smell lured 1,000 men into my clutches. Your clutches... is precisely the subject of tonight's sermon. We've talked about it many times. I like the "Thou shalt nots." I don't own this hotel. I manage it. Where would it be without you? With a new manager. Griffith watches me like a vulture. That greasy wimp. He says you tried to pick up some guy from Cincinnati. A married man, Mom. We were talking. We had a few drinks. It was perfectly innocent. His wife was there all the time. Okay. Where do you suggest we go when they kick us out of this hotel? Well, the old actors home. I'd be a resident. You'd be a manager. Cliff'd be a busboy. I'll just retire. You're going to school and acting like a student. I'll act like a hotel manager. And, Mom? Yes, Larry. Try... for God's sake, to act your age. - Are you going to act your age? - I'll try. I won't try. You try. Give 'em hell, Champ. Pick you up at 3:00. [No Audible Dialogue] [Bell Rings] Excuse me. Is 235 that way? [Reply Inaudible] [Students Chattering] Good morning. Would you please find a seat? Hey, I'm sitting there. Sorry. Hello! Would you please find a seat? Find one you like. It will be your seat the entire semester. Uh, that's saved. Would the young man in the blue shirt find a seat and sit in it? Is this saved? Feel under the desk. You've got gum dating back to Neanderthal times. Really? The gum's not the worst. The boogers freak me out. You get hepatitis from the fresh ones. Shelley, want to go out tonight? Ask Moody. Who's the new kid? I don't know. He's kind of little. - Ask where he's from. - You ask him. Weren't you in Mr. Sanford's class last year? No. I'm new. - My mistake. He is new. - [Clattering] Ladies and degenerates, here's Moody! Don't applaud. Just throw money. Aww. I'm sure we're all thrilled to have Mr. Moody among us as we begin this great adventure known as your sophomore year. I saved a seat for you. Thanks a lot. Willie, take this seat. You grew up over the summer, baby. Where did you get this hair? - K-mart. - Heh heh heh. "K-mart." What's so funny? Mr. Moody, please find a seat. This sucker swiped it from me. - I was here first. - Bullshit. If you can't find a seat back here, I'd be glad to have you come sit up front with me. Alan Blumenthal. Cyndie Rush. Move over to that seat. Ricky Linderman... Does anybody know if Ricky Linderman is in school? I hope not. Who wants him? Who's Linderman? No one, just the local mass murderer. Does anybody know if Ricky Linderman is in school or not? Probably in New York climbing the Empire State building. Thank you, Mr. Moody. Clifford... P-E-A-C-H-E. - Clifford, is that "Peach" or "Peachy"? - "Peach." Knew he was a fruit. [Chuckles] What did you say, Melvin? - Melvin? - Melvin? I don't go by that no more, Clarice. Fair enough, you call me Ms. Jump. What shall we call you? M. Big M. I like that. Is that "B.M." for short? That kid's gonna get it. You've got nerve, even if you're not gonna live long. You and me, we're gonna have a little talk after school. Right? Right? Huh? You know that was so dumb what you said to Moody. I never saw anybody put him down before. - I hope you get away with it. - Hold this, will you? Don't let him catch you in the halls alone, or on the stairs either. Hold it over the bowl. Or especially in the bathrooms. I never go to the bathroom here, if I can help it. - What do you do? - Hold it in. Stay away from liquids. - That's ridiculous. - You think so? They say one kid got thrown out a window. He's a vegetable now. - That's dumb. Who told you that? - Plenty of people. Another guy had his eye kicked out. Total gross-out. - Never found the eyeball either. - How are we doing here? What do we got? - You've done this before. - Yeah. - Did Moody do that? - What? Kick the guy's eye out. I'm not saying he did, and I'm not saying he didn't. But you're better off paying him protection money. - You pay Moody protection? - Shh! You better believe it. Lots of kids do. He takes their lunch money every day. Now I'm brown-baggin' it. Now he claims he's gonna take my bus fare. I don't think you shouldn't let him get away with it. I know, but I'm addicted to breathing. [Bell Rings] Let's go. [Horn Honks] Lock up in 15 minutes. There's a little party after school, Peachy. You're the guest of honor. - Yeah, but I have a car waiting. - Yeah, I know. Hey, Moody, got a present for you. Just a second. Bring a dollar every day, got it? Get out of here. Hey, it's Peach Pit. What do you say? Just trying to make friends. Don't you want to be friends? - All right. Here. - What about me? Sure. Shake hands with Dubrow. How you doing? Where'd you go to school before here? - South Side Academy. - Ooh, costs a lot of money to go there. - You rich? - No. Hey, that's nothing to be ashamed of, man. I'm not ashamed. - Knew he was rich. - No, I'm not, really. Hey, listen, pal, it's obvious you got bread. Question is, you got sense? I'm serious. Do you have sense? Hmm? Hmm? - I think so. Sometimes. - I think so too. So you'll know this is no private academy. Now, you go to a school like this you need a bodyguard. You know, we got Ricky Linderman in our Homeroom? You know about Linderman? He's a psychopath. He just went berserk. Wasted some kid. - Shot him in the head. - [Banging Noise] - Blew his brain out. - Why'd he do that? Probably he was a pain in the ass. Guys like Linderman lose control after a while. Yah! Like that, you know? That's when you come to us. We're bodyguards. Interested? - I don't know. - For you, it's cheap, uh... - Buck a day. - Buck a day? Yeah, buck a day. We give everyone the same deal. You can work it out day to day, or week to week. Any way you want to work it out, man. Where am I gonna get a dollar a day? Lunch money. You don't wanna eat that crap, anyway. 50 cents for Godzilla feed. It's a rip-off. Sixty, if you want two milks. So, for that same 60 cents... we're talking two milks... you got us almost paid for. Now all you got to do is... scrape up another 40. I'm not gonna give you my lunch money. I have to eat. Got to eat, huh? Come here. Come here. Tell you what, eat this. Suddenly he changes his mind, eh? Downstairs! ## [Piano] - Cut him off! - Got you now, Peachy. Get him! Come on! [All Shouting] Come on, hit it! Where you going, Peachy? Go! - Bye, Peachy! - Good-bye, Peachy! What's going on? Who were those guys? Just some kids who want to kill me. I'd like to speak to Mr. Dobbs, please. Mm-hmm. Chief of operations, yes. This is Mr. Griffith, assistant manager of the Ambassador East. He'll want to speak to me once he knows what it's about. Tell him it's quite important. Yes, I'll wait. Not near the fire! Watch the ribs over there! Don't burn the ribs! Medium rare on the steak, medium rare. Okay! Put some butter! [Chattering, Indistinct] - [French] - Yes. Yeah. - Bon appetit. - Thanks. Ciro. Ciro... I thought you'd like to know... my soup was cold. How cold was it? Very funny. [Granma] Very neat. Very neat. He's a... Oh, wait a minute. Have you any ideas who'll come in good in the fourth tomorrow? I don't know. Lucky Lew, I guess. Handicapping is a science. - Not guesswork. How about Cousin Ed? - Yeah. I've got an idea. Why don't we pack our things and leave? - Have a mint. - Mother. Where were you today at 5:00? At 5:00, let me see, I had a little drink. The guy you tried to lure into the bar is a television evangelist. - No wonder he looked so sour. - You think he was sour? You should've seen Griffith's face when he heard about it. Mother we cannot have this kind of thing going on... Oh, wow! This isn't the one we saw last night, is it? - The red sweater. - No sweater. - Let me see... - Clifford, you're too young. - You're 14. - I'm 15. Let me see. You're 15. That's one... - You're 15? - Yep. I should know that, shouldn't I? It's this damn job, 24 hours a day. I'm sorry. - I heard you got in trouble today. - Yeah. Aw, quit worrying. Your dad called up and raised hell about those boys. You called the school? Great. Now I'll really get slaughtered. Clifford, you're not going to get slaughtered. They already think I'm a fruit. The principal's going to talk to those boys... and straighten this whole thing out. And if they try anything, you go right for the eyes. Hit them hard as you can. Blind them! Takes the fight out of them. I don't think blinding fists is the answer to this problem. Well then, kick 'em in the cojones! That's the thing. No! No! - I'm older. I need this more. - [Chuckles] How would you know that? - He can't take a joke. - I don't see the humor in extortion... - Real or pretended! - [Mutters] Well, maybe, I guess... - it could have backfired a little bit. - It backfired on you. I ought to suspend you, but since school just started and since no harm was done, I'm going to be a very nice guy and let you off... - Thanks. ...with a week's detention. All right? Take a walk. Clifford? Clifford, things are less sheltered here than at Southside, but don't let that throw you. They're also less narrow. Don't cry wolf every time somebody looks at you cross-eyed. All right, son? Come on. Get out of here. ## [Piano Scales] You give me trouble. People don't do that around here. So you better grow some eyes in back of your head, because you ain't going to know when it's coming. Romeo and Juliet... Romeo and Juliet were a couple of kids... that had the hots for each other, and they couldn't do anything about it... because they lived in a society... where they had to be married to do anything about it. They still do. Romeo andJuliet is a play about love and sex... and people willing to die for it. [Moody] Yeah, I'm dying for it right now. [Laughing] Can't do anything about that. We're talking about love and art. Um... Uh-oh. Trouble. That's Linderman. Do you have a pass? You do have a pass. Thank you. If you'd like to take a seat in front, you can. Please God, let him sit up front. Not in back of me. Not in back of me. I'll have a heart attack. I swear to God. [Shouting, Chattering] Pick him up! Pick him up! Pick him up! Pick him up! Pick him up! Come on, baby! Pick him up! [Groans] Watch the rough stuff. It's only practice. [Chuckles] - [Whistle Blows] - Okay, let's go. Come on. This is basketball. Let's move it. If I were you, I'd report that to the principal. [Voices] You know, she's got nice hips. Oh, yeah. Nice hair, too. It's bleached, but that doesn't matter. I don't care how blonde-haired girls get blonde, as long as they're blonde. Physical appearance isn't anything, you know, but it helps. Yeah. She's nice-looking. Yeah. When she looks at me, she says, "There's a guy who won't take no for an answer." Oh, yeah? She sees the power, huh? Power isn't what she's after, man. [Door Closes] Hi. My accountant over here tells me you're late on your first installment, right? - That's right, isn't it? - That's right. - That's right, isn't it? - That's right. - I'm not going to pay. That's all. So... - [Flushes] Come on, man. Let's get something to eat. ## [String Quintet] Wait, Linderman. Could I ask you something? It's... it's important. I hope you don't get mad or anything, but would you like to make some money? You see, there are these guys. Maybe you noticed them in the bathroom. - They're making me pay protection. - From what? From themselves, but that's not what they say. They say they're protecting me and some other kids from... ...well, mainly you. - From me? Yeah. I know that's not true. At least, I think it's not. That's how I came up with this idea. What idea? To pay you to be my bodyguard. Maybe some other kids could, too. Also, I could do your homework. I'm pretty smart. But at least it's not paying extortion. Not interested. # I can tell from her manana # # She's a Latin from Manhattan # # But not Havana # # She does the rumba for us # #And she calls herself Dolores # # She was in a Broadway chorus # # Known as Suzy Donahue # Good morning, Mrs. Peache. How are we today? - You're not well? - I feel wonderful. Just wonderful. Oh. # She can take a tambourine # #And whack it # # But to her it's just a racket # # She's a hoofer from Fifth Avenue # # She's a Latin from Manhattan ## Good morning, Mother. Griffith, good morning. Do you want some breakfast? It's, uh, liver. No. We got a call from Mr. Dobbs. - Mr. Dobbs? - Chief of operations. He'll be paying us a little visit. Any particular reason? Search me. What's that all about? Guess. Oh, my God. Oh. Nice to hear you say grace again, sweetheart. I'm only kidding. It's very good. - Is school okay? - Yeah. Terrific. You're sure? I could call the principal again. Dad, it's okay. School's fine. I'm fine. Everything's perfect. [Laughter] Are you taking a trip? [Clifford] Where does Linderman hang out? The slaughterhouse, probably. What's the matter with him anyway? A lot of things, I hear. For one, he's supposed to have raped a teacher. I also heard he shot a cop. I know for a fact he killed a kid. In cold blood. Blew his brains out. [Clifford] I don't believe it. Look it up. It's in the newspapers. I still don't believe it. "He would not have stopped then "for anything less necessary than breath... "it being a spectral sort of race he ran, "and one highly desirable to get to the end of. "He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him, "and pictured it hopping on behind him, "bolt upright upon its narrow end, "always on the point of overtaking him "and hopping on at his side, "perhaps taking his arm. "It was a pursuer to shun. "It hid in doorways, too, "rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors "and drawing them up to its ears "as if it were laughing. "It got into shadows on the road "to trip him up. "All this time it was gaining on him. "When the boy reached his door, he had reason for being half-dead." No. I mean... Where's my money, Rick? I didn't think I had to pay 'cause Clifford isn't. - What you call me? - Nothin'. - You heard him, didn't you, Reissman? - Yeah. What are you doing? Let's go to your locker. What are you doing? Reissman's going to pay us from now on, Cliff. How about you? Let me out! Let me out! [Banging On Locker] [Banging Continues] Somebody come here! Help! Help me! Let me out! Come on! Help! Someone let me out! Want your turn? Go ahead! I haven't got all day, you big, dumb son of a bitch! [Shouting, Chattering] Yes, ma'am? Say it! Can I have a coke? Hey, Shelley, want to go to the movies tonight? I guess so. Sure. Have a real good time while you're there. Where's your limo? You feeling suicidal, or what? You should have planned ahead, because you're dead. Look at this shirt. Moody, I'd like you to meet my bodyguard. Anything you want to say to me, talk to him first. Now, what was that you were saying? Beat it, Moody. Man, we can take this guy. He's all yours, big M. Go ahead, Moody. Show him how tough you are. How about you guys? We can take this dude. He's a chump, man. Who's the fruit this time, huh, Moody? I'm walking. Don't leave me hanging, man. Not now. Melvin, your protection services are no longer required. By anyone. Know what I mean? You can go now. Hey, Moody. You owe me a year's worth of lunches. Oh, what a great day. See Carson flip him the bird? Didn't you love it? We won't let up till he pays back every cent he ever took from everybody. - You all through now? - What's wrong? We aren't doing anything. - Got it? - But aren't we a... I thought we were sort of a team now. You thought wrong. [Girls] Their team is so slow, but our team... Let's go! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Let's... go! Okay, you guys. Okay, are you guys getting it? Okay, our day is over. Looking forward to the next time. Oh, Karen, listen, don't call me tonight. - Hi. - Hi. - Where did you come from? - I was in the theater. - What'd you think? Yeah? - It was good. I'd like to talk to you about one of the kids in your class. Did you try asking one of the kids in the class? Uh, well, it's Linderman. - Oh. Ricky Linderman, huh? - Yeah. What do you want to know about Ricky Linderman? - Everybody's afraid of him. - Mm-hmm. I don't want to be, but there are all those stories about him. What do you think about those stories? They can't all be true. Well, I know something. Would you like to know what I know? Yes. About a year ago... He had a younger brother. And the kid was playing at home. Went into his father's closet, he found a loaded gun. Was playing and it accidentally went off. And he killed himself. Ricky, unfortunately, was the first person to find the body. And I don't think he's recuperated from that. That's the only story I know. What about all those stories about him killing a cop... and breaking teachers' legs? I don't know about those stories. - All I know is what I just told you. - Okay. Okay? Does that help you at all? Yeah, I think so. Okay. Is this saved? What do you call this stuff? Garbage. Would you pass the salt? Just getting the salt. Okay, so maybe we're not a team. Maybe I was wrong. But I thought when somebody does somebody a favor, he owes him one. - You don't owe me. - Yes, I do. You didn't have to do what you did, but you did it anyway. I thought it meant we were friends now. You didn't accept money. Where you going? The show's over. Show? That wasn't any show. Get lost. All I want... Do you always get what you want? Hey. Those things will stunt your growth. - Ha ha ha. - [Bell Rings] Move up a bit. Come on. Cops won't even walk around here. The next time you pull anything like this, call a detective. Okay, follow him. It's one way. Follow him anyway. - It's a one-way street. - [Horn Honking] Hey, what are you... Cliff, get back... Give us a dollar. Come on. You got a dollar, man? Give me a dollar! Hey! What are you following me for? I told you, I thought maybe we could be friends. We can't. Linderman. I know about what happened with your brother and everything. You do, huh? Hell, it could have happened to anybody. Drop it. Okay? - Ricky. - What? Where am I? How do I get out of here? Come on. Where we going? - Yours? - Yep. Fantastic. Use it much? Don't use it at all. Won't run. - You like it? - Yeah. - Get on. - Oh, no. Go ahead. Climb aboard. Yeah? Hey. Careful. What's the matter with it? Cylinder. I can't find the right one. They don't make them anymore. I've been putting this together for a year now, and I'm down to one lousy cylinder. You built this? Rebuilt it. Almost. Oh, hey, how you doing? I'm looking for a 350 cylinder. - You got one? - No, I don't. - You sure? - Nope. Sorry. [Linderman] How about your mom? [Clifford] She died in a car accident. - That's too bad. - My grandmother moved in with us. She's like no one I've ever seen before. She's really old, but she acts like a kid. She gets... a little drunk. Picks up guys. - You're kidding. - No. - Sounds great. - She is, really. We gotta keep an eye on her 'cause she gets into things. Maybe she's afraid of being old and dying. No, I think she's afraid of not being alive. My dad had one of those. It looked like that then. - What does he do? - Watches TV. How's this? Almost. He was only nine. I practically raised him since he was two. He'd drive you crazy. Tell him to sit down, he'd stand up. Tell him to do his homework, he'd read a comic book. Couldn't eat food without spitting it at you. A real shoplifter, too. Go through a store, half of it would wind up in his pocket. He was a good kid. A real handful, though. Poor little guy. Poor little guy. [No Audible Dialogue] That's her, Mr. Dobbs. I got to go. Hello, Mrs. Peache. I'd like you to meet Mr. Dobbs, chief of hotel operations. - How do you do? - Hiya, good-looking! Griffith has been telling me a great deal about you. Has he? Well, um... Uh, sit down. Have a little drink. They don't charge me. You know what I mean? This is really the life. You know, it's interesting. I must have met about a million people. Not many kids. Mostly adults. Anytime you want to trade, it's okay with me. Some view. Is this good for stargazing? Uh... stars... the, uh, moon... and, uh... other heavenly bodies. All right. What time is it? About 7:00. That's Linda over there. I trust your stay here was a pleasant one. Very pleasant. And the room was all right? Perfect. And the service was... adequate? More than adequate. Thank you. You're welcome. When will you visit next? Friday. Well, I think we can accommodate you. I certainly hope so. Dad... So have a very safe flight. And your key? You have it, Peachy. Of course. We're talking a two-day job on the air conditioning. If it gets hotter in here we're going to have some miserable customers. Well, what if we work through the night? - Night? - So we'll just have one day without it. - Night? - Night. I'd appreciate it. - [Phone Ringing] - Peache here. Thank you. Peache here. My mother? Oh, no. Where? How serious is it? Mother? Are you... Just don't get excited. He's all right. Didn't know his limitations. I warned him, but he kept saying he was an animal. Give me this. Do you know who this is? Do you know who this is? Your goose is really cooked this time, Peache. She's finally done it. Griffith... will you stop hovering over me? Get away from me. I'm just getting my second wind. You can really dance, sweetheart. You're not so bad yourself, Dobbsy, just a little out of shape. I haven't danced or had a good time for ever so long. - Sir... - Get away! Can I see you for a second? Griffith, sit down. They're getting along so well. Why not check on tomorrow's reservations? Better yet, why not make some reservations for yourself at some hotel where you'll soak your feet... - after a hard day of job hunting. - But, l... Don't worry about us. Want a job, Cliffie? Now, you just go get a little rest 'cause we got a long night ahead of us. All right. You be here in an hour, or I'll come after you. Room 735, if I'm not right here. Peache, you run a nice lively hotel here. Thank you. Are you Linderman? Would you care to trip the light fantastic? Mother. No. Aw, let's go eat. Go like this. Drop the bouquet. Hey. Hey, terrific heart line. You got a lot of girlfriends? - No, ma'am. - Heh heh. I'm talking in the future, smart guy. You're also very intellectually inclined. Think that's in the future, too. I must be right about something. You sure this is your hand? Wish I could deny it. What happened to your wrist? Nothing. Accident. Let me finish. Open up, Ricky. You're among friends. You're among friends. I see a long life line. Very good. Very valuable. You're going to live for 10 more years. Then you're going to snuff it. Mine's broken in half. - Is it? - Yeah. Ooh! You're going to die. These are your need-for-affection lines. You don't have any. Look like wrinkles. He's a sex maniac, here. Mine says, "love me." What are you trying... What does a double-jointed thumb mean? I've been looking for you guys. I've got someone I want you to meet. Clifford, this is Mike. Ricky, this is Mike. He's my bodyguard. What do you say, pal? Moody tells me you're a tough guy, huh? You're a real killer. Is that right? You beat up kids? Rape old ladies? Is that right? Huh? I heard you even killed your own brother. Got away with it too, I heard. - That's bullshit. - Is it bullshit, huh, Rick? Huh? Huh? Is it bullshit? [Chuckles] Hey, killer, why you on your knees? You queer or something? Huh? Come on. Get up. Huh? You going to hurt me? You really think you're gonna hurt me? Huh? Huh? You're not so tough. Thought you said this guy is tough. Yeah, we'll see, huh? Yeah. What is this here? What is that? That chain's gonna make you tough? Tough magazine, huh? Hey, he reads. Got an education. Huh? You're not so tough. You're not so tough, are you? Huh? Huh? Huh? You're not so tough. Come on. Come on. Come on with it. Show me what you got. Yeah. Real winner, huh? A real menace. Why don't you go kick his ass? Hey, killer. Where are you going? Is this your tough bike? Huh? This your tough bike? Don't look so tough to me. Think I'm tough enough to ride this? Huh? Come on. Get up. I think I want to ride it. I said, get up! Let's see how tough this bike is. Hey, don't! Let me go! Moody, you said this guy was bad. Don't look so bad to me. Don't! - What's it take to get him going? - Get up, man! Leave him alone. Hey, this is a drag. Call me when you really need me. I like to earn my money. Want me to kick your ass? Yes or no? Yeah, he wants me to kick his ass. Yeah, he wants me to kick his... What are you doing, Moody? Don't. Put the bike back. Moody, don't do that. Moody, don't! Moody! Hey, yeah! Yeah! Are you okay? Why didn't you fight? Where are you going? Come on, where are you going? Anyone there? Linderman? Hi. Is Ricky home? No. Who are you? I'm a friend from school. He was supposed to be home hours ago. What's your name? - Clifford. - If you see him, tell him he should get home. Okay. Hey. How did you get up here? I need some money. Where were you? I looked everywhere for you. You got any money? Come on. Give me some money. Six bucks is all I got. Thanks, Cliff. You're a good kid. Oh, well, that's great. "Give me money. Thanks, bye." That's real class. Where are you going? Linderman! Linderman! Wait up! Linderman! Linderman. Wait up, damn it! - Slow down, will you? - Go home, Clifford. You got a nice place, a nice family. Just leave me alone. - It's the fight, isn't it? - I couldn't fight. So what? I never wanted to be anyone's damned bodyguard, anyway. I told you that. It's on account of your brother. You can't fight because of what happened to your brother. - That's it, isn't it? - What do you know? It's a lousy excuse. It's nothing, Linderman. Shut up! You haven't talked for over a year. - You walk like an ape for nothing. - Shut up, Clifford! You build a bike to run away for no reason, to go nowhere. And let some jerk throw it into the lake. Shut up! All because of something you had nothing to do with. I mean, anybody could've found your brother. It happened to be you. Shut up! I didn't find him! I killed him! I shot him! Jesus. We were home alone. We were playing with my dad's gun. I was showing off like a goddamn fool. He wanted to hold it. I said you're not allowed to. He grabbed it, and it fired. My God, I was laughing when it went off. Blood gushed out of the side of his head, and he didn't even know it. Know what he worried about? That when Dad got home, he'd get spanked. The last thing he said to me, he said, "You're gonna have to take the blame for this one." I couldn't even do that right. I lied. I put the gun in his hand and said I found him that way. Damn it. I never told anyone before. It wasn't your fault. You didn't mean for it to happen. I'm sorry, Clifford. I know you mean well. I let everybody down. It's the way I am. Go home, Clifford. Hey. Where's the funeral? It can't be that bad. It's worse than ever. They took my bus fare. They flushed my lunch down the john. They called my mother names I never even heard of. I'm going to quit school. I'll never graduate anyway. - Where are you going? - Home, I guess. Come on. I'll buy you both a drink. - He might have tried calling. - He'll be back. - He just needs time to think. - Hope you're right. I'm always right. That's what you'll learn about me. Someday you'll say, "Shelley, darling, you're always right." Hey, look. Over there. It's Linderman. Did you get that out of there yourself? I know. Dumb question. I was really scared. I can cheat, can't I? It's only a game. Go ahead. Hey, where did you guys find my bike? You been fishing? Oh, no. Thanks. I'll take it now. Hey, Mike. Moody, you're a real bastard. Linderman, you picking on Moody again? Huh? - You're really beginning to annoy me. - Look. Just don't give us any trouble. - Enough is enough. - Get out! You got three seconds to make your split. Now get. Uh-uh. - Without the bike. - [Moody Chuckles] It's Moody's now. One... - two... - I tell you, some guys never learn. Okay. Take it. Ahhhh! Get on him, Mike! Okay. Okay. Come on, Mike. Come on. Come on, Ricky. Come on. Damn you, Moody! Moody? Get up. Get up. Slow down. Slow down. - Cover up. - Come on, man. Get him. Come on, get him! Get him! Come on! Hit him, kid! Come on. You want your ass kicked. Come on! Come on, you faggot. Come on, wimp. Go for his nose. Thanks. You're a wonderful human being. You know that? You need your damn bodyguard? Come on! Get him. Clifford, get him in the nose. Oh, my nose. You broke my nose. I really think I broke his nose. - You broke my nose. - You did do it. So did you. It looks better that way. Oh, my nose, man! Hey, Moody! All right. Way to go. Real impressive fight. Okay, all right. I have a question. I had this idea. You're a good fighter. Would you like to be my bodyguard? I could pay you 50 cents a day. I can do your homework for you. I'm pretty smart. Not interested. Anyway, a buck a day. A buck a day? Buck a day. Inflation, buddy. Inflation? Yeah. Wait a minute.
