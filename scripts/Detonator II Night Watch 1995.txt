Maria! - Maria! - Come back! It's okay, Maria. I've got you! You'll be okay! Get off the beach! Get down and stay down! Graham! Swim! Swim, Maria! Swim! Get your heads down! Get your heads down! Move it! Move! Come on. We can do it! Swim! Luke! Luke! Luke! - Come on! - Luke! Come on! - You can do it! Swim! - Maria, swim! Swim, baby, swim. Come on! Okay, come on! Grab my hand! Yeah. That's it. Yes! Come on. Come on, you're okay. You're okay. Let's go. Go. Find the one phone in amongst all those that's a weapon, could you? What would you look for? That one phone will change everything. War is about to find a new home. E c onomic powerhouses have been slugging it out for years, but in moments a third-rate power will become a world threat. Listen. I'm goi ng to activate one chip. Our strategy will be dropping mining stock... Don 't worry about your tips. I've just sent all my research papers for printing. That gives you three more hours... We've tapped into everything moving th rough the exchange from one phone. Isolate a conversation. Dollars, not yen? It's that or watch - We can 't take that. - That's right. Okay, I 'll authorize $5 billion for discretionary buying as of 1100 hours. Want to buy today, get rich tomorrow? What about military information? To hear strategic air command, we need just one of our phones. NATO, ClA, U.N. Their superhighway will end right here. - Now show me phase two. - What, so soon? Show me. - I'll sell you at 3-5-1. - 51, Hong Kong air. I got a bid of 51. I've got a bid of 51. That's going to be today's high-- Total information meltdown. Anywhere we have a phone. But to control the phones, they needed one final tool. Now we launch the satellite. And now Roger Flint reports from Wall Street. Yesterday's meltdown of the Hong Kong stock exchange roared through Wall Street like a money scorching-- You can feel the panic from up here. By the closing bell the Dow had fallen over 1,000 points. Dan McGavin, a broker with Brenner, Nathan, Hart summed it up. Once Joe average gets it into his head the market's out of control, they want out, any price. They were telling me, " Sell, sell, sell," but nobody's buying. This is a nervous group. Now here's a look at how the Hong Kong crash affects the small investor. We lost everything, our kids' savings... Who would think a thunderstorm in Hong Kong could make such a mess? I think it's more than the thunderstorm. Trading in Hong Kong will be suspended... - Sir. - What's up? We lost communication with Graham and Sheehan at 0700. - What about the diplomat's children? - Not a word. Thank you. Amid the global financial chaos, a glimmer of good news for the residents of Amsterdam. After two years on a nine-country world tour, the priceless " Night Watch," Rembrandt's largest work, finally returns to its home, Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum. Beginning tomorrow, the majestic piece will again be on exhibition for the anxious public. The finest example of baroque chiaroscuro ever created. Oh, what a magnificent piece! Bring me a basket. I have to throw up. Ohh... Stephanie. Yes? Bring me Abraham's " Rembrandt." Yes, Dr. Armand. What is it, Louis? The drummer. What? What do you mean? Maybe it's his drum. - Page 347, please. - Looks perfectly fine to me. Uh-huh! What color is this dot? Blue. - It's blue. - Yes. And this dot? Let's see what the X-ray machine shows. Miles, this is not the " Night Watch." This is a fake. Thanks. Not one country will help. How can that be, inspector? They don't want the blame. It should never have left these walls. It's not my fault, Louis. Do you expect me to guard a painting - day and night for two years? - I would have, if it was my idea to launch its tour. Gentlemen, calm down. We're bringing in experts from the U.N. The U.N.? Huh! This isn't about terrorism. Because our intelligence was wrong. The kids had been hidden in the village. You got them out, all of them. Yeah. They're alive because of you. Yeah. How do you feel about that? You want me to say the mission was a success? All right, the mission was a success. Opening up to your feelings Is nothing to be ashamed about, Michael. Excuse me. You want to work, Michael? I don't think that would be wise. Would you make a note of that, doctor? Michael? I don't know. Detective work, no combat. Expense accounts. Hmm. Something to keep me busy? - Exactly. It'll be with Carver. - Ah. Mr. Caldwell, I can't authorize field work until Michael's psychological evaluation's completed. Thank you. Could you make a note of that also? - Would you say this job will be cushy? - You could say that. - Travel? - Here and there. Sabrina Carver, you said? I did. Hmm. Thank you. Let's go. It's not Sabrina, you know. - Of course not. - No, I mean it. I couldn't stand another moment with that shrink. Come on in. Yes, sir? Carver, what do you know about Rembrandt's " Night Watch"? Um... the company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq and Lieutenant Willem Van Ruytenburch, commissioned in 1640, completed in 1642. I know a little bit about it, sir. Hi, Michael. - Hello, Sabrina. - How are you? Not bad. You cut your hair. Oh, yeah. Look-- I'm really sorry about what happened. I mean, I know it must be hard for you. - You got the kids out. - I've already heard that one. I've been thinking of teaming you two up. Any objections, Carver? - No. - Excellent. " Night Watch" has been stolen and a forgery substituted. I want you two to find the original. You'll start in Amsterdam at the Rijksmuseum. On this one, Carver will be in command. - Nick, just a moment here on this-- - Her art expertise - tips the scales in her favor. - Okay. You can spend some more time with the psychologist. Here. Special services will fill you in on that. - It does more than tell the time? - lndeed it does. Oh yeah, look at that. Huh. Dick Tracy to Chief. Dick Tracy to Chief. It's okay. I haven't lost my sense of humor. I'm still a fun-loving guy. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. Hair looks good, by the way... boss. From our X-ray lab, this is what is underneath it. A real old painting? Oh, yes. It's Dutch. The 17th century. A landscape. You know, rarely do we sample the paint - since it's a destructive process. - Uh-huh. So a forger generally uses an old canvas as a base, and he hopes to pass any cursory analysis. Is there any record of the original painting changing hands? Cash purchase at auction, Sotheby's, Kensington. While being transported, the van was stolen. Gosh, this is an amazing forgery. Just what the Dutc h c raftsmen a re known for. I ndeed. But the paint, it was manufactured in the Far East. - Meaning? - Dutch painters use European paint. - Not necessarily. - Whatever. None of th is would be happening if Miles hadn't insisted on the tour. Lou is, did it ever occur to you that the painting was swapped before the tour? Impossible! I would have noticed. I would have noticed, and he knows it. Miss Carver, we catalogue our local artists, so maybe if you searched our slides - for the forger -- - I'd be glad to. Thank you. - Okay. I'll arrange it then. - Great. Ahh, yes. Well, quite a pair, our boys, aren't they? - Well, at least they're enthusiastic. - Yeah. So am I. So am I. It seems the guy who bought this lousy landscape Iives here in Amsterdam. - Lemmer, the dealer. - Art? Heroin. Lemmer's been either pushing or in prison - for the last 20 years. - Which is he now? Let's find out. Hi. Fascinating, isn't it? Oh, yeah. How many images do you have? Oh, well over a million. Oh, great. I leave you now. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Ohh. Lemmer, the guy who bought the painting, lives here. Well, I can't imagine that big old painting hanging over his mantel piece. - I'm gonna take a poke around. - We don't have a warrant. Yeah, I know that. Okay. You better not be here. I'll see you later. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'll handle it myself! ## Sugar ## ## Ooh-ooh ## ## Ah, honey, honey ## ## Oh, yeah ## ## I am your candy girl ## ## And you got me wanting you ## ## I 'm gonna make your life so sweet ## ## Sugar ## ## Baby girl ## ## Ah, honey, honey... ## Hi. ## Oh, yeah... ## You're not going to believe this, but I'm looking for this very large p-- ## Make your life so sweet ## ## Honey, you 're so sweet ## ## Ah, sugar, sugar ## ## Oh, yeah ## ## I am your candy girl ## ## And you got me wanting you ## ## I 'm gonna make your life so sweet ## ## Sugar... ## ## And you got me wanting you... ## What are you doing here? Me? - Who is this guy? - What? What the hell are you doing on this guy's boat if you don't know who the hell he is? Look, I'm asking the questions around here. Oh, jeez. The guy cut me. Michael! You're hurt! Don't fuss. Please, please don't fuss. Michael-- This job was supposed to be easy. I want to talk to her. You burglarized his place. He's the one who can press charges. - And you did it on my watch. - If you'd just-- Well, at least we know Miles Van Dehn is involved somehow. - He met with Lemmer. - Lemmer bought the painting, had it stolen to cover where it went next. Oh, I don't think so. - I want to tail this guy in here. - You better not let the lieut-- You come with me. We're going to generate enough paperwork. Lemmer can't make trouble. - Can I ask just one question? - Now! Mike, he looks a little mad, maybe you should go talk to him. Are we done? Hey, you think I enjoy staying late? Oh... Mike. He's home. Glad to hear you're still on the job. Oh, man. Who did this to you? Lemmer? He's gone. Where'd he go? I don't know. Eh? He came home from the cops mad. Oh, jeez. I'm so sorry. Come on, come on. Come here. Let's take you to the hospital. Come on. Come on. There you go. Brokerage firms and their clients were still staggering from the effects of what's being termed "the Hong Kong massacre." Stock prices continued falling with no bottom in sight. This morning, the federal reserve - made an emergency announcement... - Yeah. Michael, go to visual. - I see you. - We may have a lead. In every city the " Night Watch" was exhibited, the local museums picked up the expenses. Every city but Hong Kong. There... Martin Schraeder, art connoisseur, businessman, he picked up the whole ticket. - American? - Yeah. We're doing a full background. What about your other suspects? Yeah, could be. Got to go. - How you doing? - Okay. Pain killers. - How come you're still here? - I just thought... you might like a cup of coffee. Hmm? Come on. Let me ask you a question. Has he done this to you before? You know. - I'm not going anywhere with you. - Okay. - We'll just talk here. - I don't talk to cops. I'm going home. Look, if you're looking for Lemmer, he's not there. The cops picked him up. - What for? - Assault. I called it in. - Leave me alone. - Jennifer, Jennifer-- - No. Get out of my face! - All right-- Jennifer! Hey! Come here! Pressure. Push, push. Call an ambulance! Hey! Hey! Hey! Get away! Look. I just want to talk, all right? Oh! Ho, ho! What happened next? I don't remember. You don't remember doing this? Well, I didn't do that. You're sure? Yeah. What happened to your knuckles? - Oh, that's work. - What kind of work? Th is guy is not going to talk. He might. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you. So am I. - Look, it's no big deal, really. - Yes, it is. Oh, come on. Don't start that. I mean, It's not like what happened at the beach with Luke, okay? - Yeah. - Not at all. Yeah, sure. Sure. It's just that... It's just that I feell... should've been there, I should've done more. I should have gotten closer with the boat. I... I know that nobody, nobody could've saved Luke if you couldn't have. Someday you'll know that too. - Hey. - Yeah, yeah, come in. Hi. That's okay. He can't see you. So what, man? She fell. We didn't fight. She fell. She's a stupid, clumsy twit, man. Doctors say she's got scars for life. Yeah. Who gives a damn? You don 't care that she ended up in the hospital? - No, why should l? - Yeah... right. Why is it the waitress at the coffee shop says you told her... I know what he did with that painting. That's what you want to know, isn't it? Yes. After it was nicked from the van, he gave it to some guy. Who? Hmm. Don't know. He lived in Hong Kong. Thank you. Welcome to the Regent Hong Kong, Mr. a nd Mrs. Graham. Thank you. How do they know our names? Class-- theirs. Hi. Did you have a pleasant flight, Mrs. Graham? Yes. Thank you. Excellent. The manager's reserved our honeymoon suite for you, with his compliments. Isn't that wonderful, darling? Just wonderful. - Thank you very much. - Yes. Oh my, a suite. What a lavish room. Yes, I can't wait to be in your loving arms. - Oh, Mike, cool it. - Is that an order? I think Caldwell's created the perfect cover for us. Whatever you say, dear. I mean, it lets us work together, and it explains our trip. It doesn't explain where you're sleeping. Does it, now? Yeah. Yes, very nice. Yeah. Let me see the other one, can I? Just side by side? That's it, yeah. I don 't know. Mm-hmm, that's good. I think they're both lovely. Excuse me just a moment. Michael. Mikey! - Yeah? - Your watch is on. U h-huh. What are you doing? I'm a guy on his honeymoon, right? You're about to have a chaperone-- me. It's not necessary. I promise you. It's a matter of expediting, avoiding the Hong Kong police, keeping things greased. In addition, meet Myra Tang, your local ClA connection. Myra Tang, Hong Kong office. Hmm, easy on the eyes, eh? Michael, one identity at a time. Yes, sir. I'll see you tomorrow. Martin Schraeder's. Wow. What's he going to do when the red Chinese take over in '97? Good question. Same one everyone's asking. Stay and trust the Communists, or retreat to safer ground. Have you been inside, Myra? Yeah. Parties. Art everywhere. But no " N ight Watch"? Oh sure. It's probably hanging in the front hall with a little brass plaque saying "Stolen from the Rijksmuseum." Hey, Martin Schraeder is the only lead I can offer. Okay, wel I maybe you two girls should go out there, just knock on the door, and see if you can get invited in. I thought I'd introduce you to Schraeder at his casino in Macao. You can do that? Being the lottery girl does have its perks, you know. Wait a minute. What are you saying? This guy's going to invite us up to his place and say, "Look, here's my stolen painting"? Look, when you come up with a better idea, let me know, okay? - Okay, fine. - Good. Mike, this is Mao Yixin. Hi. Mike Graham. Call me Tim. - You winning, Mike? - Oh, just pocket change, Tim. Myra here tells me you run this place. - It's very nice. - Thank you very much indeed. And this is a friend from my modeling days. - Sabrina Carver. - Uh, it's Graham now. Sabrina Graham. Oh, newlyweds. - Mm-hmm. - Yes, two days ago. In that case, the esplanade would like to offer you worth of good luck. Thanks! What a charmer, eh? Martin Schraeder. Hi, how you doing? Oh, yeah. Well, that would make it show time, girls. Shall we? What's the bet limit? - 5,000 U.S. - Uh-huh. Uh, Caldwell's not going to cover you, you know. - This is your money. - Mm-hmm. Hit me. House has a natural. Mm-hmm. Shall we up the stakes? Mike, are you kidding? You already lost $ 5, 000. Shall we say 10,000? How about a quarter million? He's really put Schraeder on the spot. The customer with the mustache wants to bet $250,000. You want to bet $250,000 on one hand? That's right. - Myra? - This is Mike Graham. His wife Sabrina's an old friend. I'm good for it. All right. One against the bank. Save the lecture. Just wish me luck. You know that I do. Thank you. I'd like a glass of water, please, And a vodka martini straight up with a twist waiting over there. Thank you. The game is blackjack. House rules. Mr. Graham's bet is $250,000. Eight. - Could pull a five-card trick. - Meaning? He'll beat the house, no matter what. Hit me. Ace. - One. - Oh! Wait. Um... I'm gonna need another card. Six cards under 21, the house pays double. The dealer gives me the sixth card face down. The house plays its hand out. You've got no option but to go for a six-card trick. Should the house bust... and my card is six or more, I pay you 250,000. If the house busts and my last card is five or under... you pay me out. Pay you out... $1 million? Done. The house is bust. The four of hearts. Mr. Graham's total is 20. The house owes you $1 million. Martin Schraeder. It's my million you just won. You're the second-best thing on my honeymoon, Mr. Schraeder. - To you or cash? - That's a good question, let me see. Myra, which is the most needy charity in town? The Royal Orphans' Fund. There you have it. Short of my initial 5,000, and give the rest to the orphans, royal or not. Unbelievable. Yeah, well, I made my fortune, auto parts. A little stock racing on the side. Always happy to have another sponsor, if you feel sassy. "Bluegrass Auto Parts." Kentucky? Entire South. Started in Kentucky. I'm from Indiana. You don't say. Well, I won't tell a nybody. So, what were you going to tell Caldwel l if you lost all that money? What if Schraeder has us under surveillance? I mean, how do you tell your best buddy that you lost all that money on your honeymoon? Sweetie, I ain't going to think about it because it didn't happen. Mmm. Nice buns. Oh, baby, you looked good tonight. You looked very, very hot. Yes. Yes. Yes. Nice bouncy bed and everything like that. I guess you're going to slip into something nice and cool, now, aren't you? Uh, well, Michael, I admit it's turn-on, but, uh-- I'm really pretty tired, you know? You feel tired, do you, darling? I feel very-- feeling kind of up and peppy. Michael, I'm actually really, really tired. Yes. So, I must say, Hong Kong is a little sweaty, don't you think? Yes. Actually, I'm really very tired. You're very tired. Well-- I feel good, actually. Oh-- socks. I feel very, very awake. Good. Relaxed. Yes. Oh, baby. Baby. Baby. It's the PJs again. Oh. What is it a bout those PJs that gets me so hot, eh? My good luck. Come and get it, honeybunch. I'm all yours. I'm waiting. - I'll get the light. - No, no, leave it on. Michael, are you crazy? - I don't think so. - I'm gonna get the light. Don't you like to see what you're-- ow! Oh! Very boisterous, my darling. Very boisterous. Oh, darling. Oooh, Sabrina. Oh, oh, darling. Michael! - Oh, oh, darling. - Shh, shh! Stop it, Michael! What--? Oh, Michael. That was great, really great. I'm so pleased, darling. I'm so pleased. I know you love quickies. Here I come again. Ohh! Well, good night. I get the hint. It was-- just overcome with passion there, aren't you? I'll make my way to the bathroom. I think I will. That's one thing I love about you. Just walking a little funny, that's all. I must say, darling, marrying you was the smartest bet I ever made. Oh, Mike! Mike, here 's your profile on Martin Schraeder. - Shoot. - He was chief engineer for Aztec, a telecom company in Silicon Valley. He was accused of industrial espionage and fired eight years ago. Mm-hmm. He do time? - No, charges were dropped. - Yeah? And a year before, his wife and only daughter were killed in a car accident. Sounds suspicious. No, Schraeder was driving. I'm logging off. Take care. The company's sweeping your hotel room for surveillance gear. Good. It's hard keeping up a honeymoon 24 hours a day. Speak for yourself. What? You like him? Honey, who wouldn't? Oh, Myra, you cheap slut. With him, any time. Anywhere. You're not attracted? No, of course not. We work together. Right. It's true. So, what do you think? I think... all your cards are on the table. Good. Graham to base. Graham to base. - Got you. - Sending you some video. I'm sending you some video of two guys. - Run a check on them, will you? - I'll be delighted. Did you get that? I certainly did. We 'll begin enhancement. Gracias, amiga. Okay, Schraeder's estate. We found the architect's original drawings and loaded them into the computer. Here, he could have a hidden room. Th is air vent is the only direct access from the outside. That's at least 100 feet off the ground. It's 113 feet, to be exact. Bathroom window. - No video surveillance. - Exactly. Unless Schraeder's a voyeur. Martin Schraeder's a lot of things, but that's not one of them. Any more on that industrial espionage charge? Just dropped. The fact that Schraeder didn't sue for wrongful discharge tells me he's guilty of something. You don't buy an estate like his on an engineer's salary. - I can climb this, you know. - It's a sheer rock wall. You can go through the vent during the party, and scope it out. - Nick. - Ted! I want you to meet Mike Graham, Sabrina Carver. This is Ted Fisk, head of ClA operations here. - Shall I show you what I got? - I think you should. Right. The murder you taped, Mike-- the local police are pretty hush-hush. The ClA aren't their favorite allies, I'm afraid. But the murder victim was a computer designer-- hardware mostly. When the Hong Kong stock exchange collapsed, he was called in. Here is an enhancement of Mike's video. That looks like a computer chip in Mao Yixin's hand. Besides the obvious on Mao Yixin-- he's Schraeder's longtime employee-- we've got nothing. Nothing? The ClA has nothing? - We need prints here. - I'll handle it. You have to pay attention. This guy's a killer. Once the computer chips are completed, they're installed in the phones, just like any other component. General Kim wonders about security. These people have no idea what my c hip's capable of. Don't worry. The genera I doesn't worry. He relies on me. The general needs clarity about his satellite. Oh, it's his satellite. The People's Republic of North Korea paid for it. There you are, General Kim. Let me show you something. Have a seat. Let me show you what your money bought. Now, executing worldwide data collection requires a satellite, but once it's in orbit, we can use cellular transponders to bounce signals from any point on the globe. As you can see, with one satellite, we can eavesd rop on world-wide telecommunications, or, at the proper moment, destroy whatever systems you choose. Only North Korea would be safe. And un like your nuclear program, it's reliable and secret. What if I can't keep Schraeder busy? Mike! Are you listening to me? Yes, of course I am. You are so stubborn! You ought to know! Okay, I admit it. I'm worried a bout your safety. I'm worried about your safety. - Artist? - Titus-- Titan-- Titian. His na me's pronounced "teeshan." ltalian. - Title? - Uh... " Love." " Sacred and Profane Love." Know the difference? - What about this one? - Oh... yeah, I know this guy. He has a TV show. - Van Dyck. - Sure his name's not "The Beaver"? - Mm. - What a bout this? Mary Cassatt, " The Bath. " An American who lived in Paris - around... 1890. - Wow. Huh. My mother loved Mary Cassatt. I grew up with "The Bath" in our kitchen. Hmm, not such a savage after all. I think I'm a little overdressed. No, you look lovely, darling, just lovely. Oh, there's Myra. Mike, I can see no one told you about Schraeder's parties. Really? Why's that? An old tradition. An informal competition for the most daring dress. Hmm. You look-- very traditional. Where's Schraeder? Oh, there he is by the Gauguin. Gauguin? Oh, it is a Gauguin, isn't it? Mm-hmm. Yes, it is a Gauguin. He had a great sense of erotic sensuality. The tropical blush, the fine lines-- - I think I'll keep Schraeder busy. - What a good idea, darling. - Great eye for a good breast too. - Mike, get to work. I'll go make a living. Lovely dress. How about a private tour for a lady who'll appreciate it? Well, I have to admit Mike's not very enthusiastic about art. What the hell? - He's a heck of a gambler. - That's true. Let me know when he comes out. Okay. It's all right. Unfortunately it's a copy-- see? "Copy of an original from the Wichita Art Museum, Kansas." It's not like they're forgeries. I ad mired them so much, I commissioned my own. Well, they're perfect. Like that one! I remember seeing the original in Chicago. I love Degas. Look how he's captured her innocence. "L'Etoile. " You're the star tonight. I thought you might do that. But you didn't move away. No. I understand you. Do you? - Is Graham out? - No, sir. Where's Schraeder? Tragical. Graham to Caldwell... Graham to Caldwell... - Caldwell. - Transmitting video. So there's your " Night Watch," Nick. Yeah, but what's the other thing? Mao Yixin, why the hurry? Oh, nothing. My fourth-- or is it my fifth champagne? Please. Get me some more? Take me back to the party! - Sabrina, I thought you wanted-- - Let me go. This is your fifth, or is it sixth? So you won't remember tomorrow when I tell you that-- I would like to kiss your breast till dawn? But I'm unfortunately working. You know, you really-- Mr. Graham? - Mr. Graham? - Yes? Is everything all right? Uh... uh... I 've been better. - Anything I can do? - Nope, thanks. You don't sound yourself, Mr. Graham. Patience, Timothy, patience. Hi, Woo, it's all yours. Mind the step. Sabrina. I'm sorry I misread your signals. Martin, act your age, okay? Telling Mike will only tarnish your honeymoon. Such wisdom. Oh-- Mike? Mike, Martin showed me his collection. - He's got some beautiful paintings. - Oh, great. - Honey, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay, sweetheart. I've got this terrible stomachache. I think we really should go. I'm sorry to hear that, Mike. Need a doctor? No, that's okay. I don't need a doctor. Just some hotel time, that's okay. Listen, this was great. Good to see you again. - Yeah. - Good night. Bye. Oh, hi. Watch the Americans. - That was close. - It sure was. - Look at me. - Hmm? Someone is on to us. - Kiss me. - What? Thanks. - Myra, you want a ride? - Yeah, sure. Heck of a party. I wouldn't know. - Feeling badly? - Was. I must say that kiss made it feel a lot better. Well, I'm glad I could be of help, darling. I wish we had gotten to dance, Mike. Maybe I can take you both to a club while you are here. This corner is fine, thanks! Uh... Myra, that would be great. Mike, me, you and... your date? We'll talk tomorrow. Good night! Carry on. - Well? - Just a good night kiss. - Fisk. - Falcon, Falcon. This is Myra. - Code red. - Position, Myra? Jeffren canyon. Mao Yixin is after me. I'm unarmed. Hurry! Myra's in trouble. What was I supposed to do, turn away from her? She wanted to kiss me. Caldwell and Fisk are responding to a mayday from Myra. Myra? When? Five minutes ago. Mr. Schraeder, it's for you. Hello, this is Martin. Check the satellite! Somebody knows something. - What do you mean? - Just do it! Good evening, Mr. Schraeder. Definitely a space vehicle. Probably a satellite. UNACO's running Mao Yixin's fingerprints, but there's nothing yet. You know, what I don't understand is, why would Schraeder have all those reproductions in his private study? I mean, they're not worth much. What does this satellite need as a launch vehicle? Not a lot. This is one miniature piece of equipment. What if they're real? - What? - Schraeder's paintings. He swapped the " Night Watch," he could have swapped lots of paintings. I'd recognize a real Degas if I saw one. Are you sure? Yolanda, it's Nic k. Where did you see this Degas? Um... Chicago Art Institute. I want you to call the Chicago Art Institute, and ask them to check on the authenticity of "L'Etoile" by Degas. Yeah, now. We need a list of all of Schraeder's art. Damn! Myra and the Grahams were working together. - You don't know that. - Shut up! This arrogant scheme-- why the hell did you insist on forging painti ngs? You got over a million phones and I just finished the satellite that controls them. You remember that when you badmouth our deal. Our deal... is over. We know Mao killed the girl. We know the painting's there. Okay, but it's the satellite now. I mean, we found a guy who's built a satellite. But for what? That's what Caldwell's after. Caldwell barely knew Myra. For him it's just business. Mike, listen. Caldwell has to deal with a lot of crap. A lot of red tape. We just have to give him some time. Yeah well, he can take his time. I'm gonna go after Mao. Mike, listen. Mike! Mike, that's an order! Michael! Damn it, Michael! Help! Help! Stop it! Help! - Are you all right? - No. Can I help you? Who do you work for? Answer me! Sabrina! Hey, have you seen a girl around? Mike, I'm here! You screwed up, Graham. I mean this time. Just this time. I don't want to lose another partner. I know. Especially you. Mao Yixin? I finally got something on his fingerprints from U.S. Customs. He's a high-ranking member of the Communist party of the People's Republic of North Korea. - North Korea? - He visited California the same year Schraeder left for Hong Kong. I'll bet Mao's running their show. What do you think you are doing? Satellite is ready to launch from Hong Kong harbor. Since when have you--? The capitalist as his true self. If you're thinking of killing me, there's a password you'd better know. Ah, the password for the satellite software, is that the password you're speaking of, Martin? On permanent loan from the National Gallery in Washington, your illustrious capital. You see, it's like this, Martin. I have spent the last eight years babysitting a capitalist eccentric while he created the weapon of the 21 st century. A perfect marriage of technology, convenience and greed. Now... what's the password? Huh-uh, you won't do it. You're thinking I'll kill you once I get the password? Oh, no, no, no. I mean what if the system fails? Now, the password. No! You won't burn it. Watch me. Watch me, Martin. Stop, oh God! There are many more paintings and I have plenty of lighter fuel. The password is... "hoosier." H-O-O-S... I-E-R. So as far as the Hong Kong police are concerned, - there were no witnesses to the murder. - What else? I'm transmitting now. Aztec Scientific, the company Schraeder was fired from, built the scrambling system for the US military communications. - Did he work on it? - He designed it. Details from the pentagon soon, okay? I'm logging off. The phone. Fisk! Send your systems expert in here. Watch this. Authorization to commence routine procedural rotation of sector two, agent Sang to supervise. Our top six agents in zone F, Burma, Laos, are to fly immediately-- Hey, that's a secure line from Washington! No, it ain't. Not with this little guy. Let's try patching it into the mainframe. - Oh God. - Cyberspace overload. That's amazing. Was that suppose to do that? Apparently. A communication bomb. Wait a second. When the eavesd ropping phone gets the signal... bingo! Everything blows? - And it's all controlled by... - By the satellite. Snappy. Pretty snappy. Is there anything worse than seeing your children die? Take them with you. - Please for mankid's sake. - No. Mankind has been enjoying your fakes for years. Mankind doesn't know the damn difference. Zhung. After you've seen them burn, you can blow to kingdom come. These last eight years have been hell, Martin, but today... today makes up for it. Good bye, Ma rti n. The Degas at the Chicago Art Institute is a fake. Mike, Schraeder had a Mary Cassatt in his collection. Come on, guys, move it, move it! Red Star, on our way to you. Roger. Docking in 10 minutes. No, please, no! Sergeant! On the door! Come on. Let's go, let's go! Where is that coming from? - I'll go. - No, I'll go. Wait. Wa-- - I like this. Let's go. - Help me! - I hear Schraeder. - They're burning the paintings. Get me out of here! Help! - Please! No! - Schraeder, is that you in there? - Yes, where are you? - Let me go first. This could be a setup. What are you doing? I'm ordering you to let me decide. How do we beat security, Schraeder? - You can't. - I'll do it. Entry denied. Go. The paintings, Mao's booby-trapped them! Um... - where's the satellite? - Mao took it to launch. Where is the launch pad? They're rendezvousing with a Korean freighter-- equipped with a rocket. Pier 44. Two Mercedes vans, white. One is ground control. Fisk, search the estate. You and you, let's go. No, wait! There's a bomb! A bomb? A bomb, a bomb. - Mike. - It's okay, it's okay. I got it, I got it. - Red, yellow, black. - Be careful. Blue. Oh! Oh, sh-- All out! Go! Everybody clear the building. Outside! What the--! Come on! Mike! The idea is to get there alive. Exactly. I hope you two realize that this honeymoon cover it's just that-- cover. UNACO agents do not get romantically involved. - Of course, sir. - Did you get that, Michael? Oh, hell yes, Nick. I'm just glad to be here. ...satellite dish. Watch out! Could be booby-trapped. - It's empty. - Where 's the satellite? - Look! Over there. - That's our freighter. Let's go. Sabrina, see if you can find the mission control van. - Oh, c'mon-- - Do it now, do it! Close the door! Be carefu l, Mike. Oi, buddy, come here! Come here, oi! - We want your boat. - My boat? - It's not my boat. - Thanks very much. Off, off! Throw the line! Throw the bloody line! Throw the line, come on! When do I get my boat back? Hey, hey! - How about that rope? - Yeah, I see it. I'll get you close. Give me your gun. I'll decoy! Countdown... Lift-off. Freeze! Okay, where is the-- get down! Where is the abort button? Come on! Hey! Get back here! Oh! Oh. Oh! Grahams. Room 1435. Um, yes. Michael Graham. Room 1-4-3-5. And a separate room for Miss Carver. Look, I think there's been a mistake. No mistake. I'm the man in the middle. Now, children, this is Rembrandt's largest painting. It's called the " Night Watch." How many people can you see in the shadows? Now, that, the real one, - is a beautiful piece of work. - Hmm. Can you tell the difference? I mean, are you sure this is the " Night Watch"? The real, no-kidding, Rembrandt's " Night Watch"? Because me, I mean, I don't know about you, but-- I can't tell the difference. Of course I can tell. That's it. Okay. Got you guessing, eh?
