I can think of a hundred things I'd rather have happen to me than be dropped off by my mom in front of the entire school. Like walking to school in those? Excuse me. These are the most comfortable shoes I own. Yeah, I'm sure. Hey! Please tell me one of you guys has figured out the extra credit problems - for geometry already? - Here. I got it from Eddie. Who got his from Sarah, who got hers from... It doesn't matter. All I know is my source is good. I have a 98% in the class. Thank you. - Why are you thanking her? - Well, now you'll owe her. On second thought, I should probably just figure it out for myself. Even though I'm failing. You can be so weird sometimes, Emma. The sooner you realize getting ahead in life requires work-arounds, the sooner I can invite you on one of our family trips. You're taking her to Greece? I thought you were taking me. I am. - Nobody likes a goody two-shoes. - Hey, now! All I know is, you better not miss tonight's game for a little extra credit. No, Emma's not gonna miss. She knows we need her. Yeah, you need me there while you guys all drool over Jacob Murphy and his stinky, wet jersey? Like, he and everyone else on that team are, like, the biggest show-offs. You girls coming to the game? Jacob! Emma was just telling us how awesome of a job you're doing this season. What, you've been to our practices or something? No. But I am feeling major basketball vibes. A winning streak is in your future. Well, you know it. Nice. - Don't worry, we'll be there. - Awesome. - See ya. - Bye, guys. Later, Emma. I'm dying. I'm dying for you! What was that? Okay, Jacob is your extra credit. You are coming to the game tonight. Has to be worth more than this. - How 'bout 375? - Yes! I got 375. 375, will it be four? Final call going once, 375 could it be four, going twice. Sell it. Jacob Murphy is such a babe. Can you believe he scored a three-pointer at the last second? Will you stop obsessing over your grades? Come on! Let's have fun! Just let her go. Basketball vibes, baby. That's what I'm talkin' about. - Great job. Nice game. - Thanks, man. Thanks. This guy killed it. Yeah, thanks for comin', girl! What are we standing around for? Let's get out of here, man! Come on. I gotta go. But good game! Emma. I'm so behind. Well, I mean, hey, let us take you home at least. No, my mom's gonna be here, like, any minute. But thanks, though. She can be such a downer. Guys, we can still have fun without her. Right? Yes. Yes, we can. All right! You guys wanna grab a bite or somethin'? - Yeah. - You know it, man. - Who's driving? - Not me! - Me! I'm driving. - What? Emma! Come on! She'll be here soon, I swear. Liar! - Get in! - Come on, we'll take you home. Let's go! Okay, fine. What are we doing? Conquering our fears. You don't even need me. All right, you good? - How do I get out of the car? - You crushed that last basket, man. I'm always ready. - All right. - All right, let's do it. All right. Anyone have a flashlight? Already on it, girl. - Mind blown. - Yeah. Here we go. Why do I always go first? - You ready for this? - You ready? Ready? - Let's do it. - Ready. - It only counts if you stay on for 10 seconds. - Cat. - Want a boost? - Thank you. Easy-peasy. How can this be safe, Cat? - Come on. Nothing's gonna happen. - It's cool, guys. She's got this. It's not like they're gonna buck her off or anything. I mean, they might. I heard the horses are old and weak. Nicki? Nicki, what are you doing? Maybe she stepped in manure. Someone should go in. Catherine? I can't climb the fence in these! All right, ringleader, come prepared next time. "Let's go to a ranch in my heels." Nicki! Nicki! Nicki? Nicki? That's not funny. Come on, let's go. I found one. What? No, Nicki, you don't have to do this! I'm riding this one. You'll ride that one. Nicki! Nicki! You wanna tell me what you're doing here, young lady? Breaking and entering private property. Putting yourself and high-risk animals in danger. "High-risk"? Yeah. Apparently, the horse in your little stunt the other night was recovering from a wound. Emma, what in the world were you thinking? This is nothing like you. You're an honors student. You have great attendance. But lately, I mean, you know, this is the third time this year that you have been in my office. And you are very lucky that the owner of the ranch called me instead of pressing charges. Yes, ma'am. Well, I have figured out a punishment that suits the crime. Three days a week, starting tomorrow, you are going to work at that ranch doing whatever they need. No absences, no tardies. And if you're responsible, and I get back a positive report, then we can pretend that none of this ever happened. You got it? For how long? Thank you. Emma? You sure you don't wanna tell me who else was with you the other night? I hope it was worth it. To say I'm disappointed in you is an understatement, Emma. Mom, it's not what you think. You realize you were illegally trespassing onto private property? You not only could have hurt one of those horses, you could've been hurt yourself. It wasn't like that. Well, how was it like? I mean, yes. I know you're gonna make mistakes once in a while, but... To allow yourself to be put in that... Go to your room, please. I need to think about how long I need to ground you for. I'll call you when dinner's ready. Mom! Go. You know that time that you broke into your uncle's garage and took his scooter so that you could take your friends on a joyride? I'm trying to remember how old you were. Fourteen. That's right. Emma, dinner! Listen, honey. I'm sorry this happened to you. But facing the consequences of your actions is... It's a part of life. If this was your first mishap it would be one thing, but, hon, your grades have been slipping, you've been skipping classes. And these friends of yours keep getting you into trouble. There's nothing wrong with my friends, Mom. I made a mistake and I said I'll never do it again. Okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry for all of it. As for being grounded, I think it should last as long as you're working at this ranch place. That means no study dates with your friends, no basketball games, no school activities. But what about the dance? You know, when I was in school, we danced to live bands, not that hippity-hoppity DJ stuff. Look, if you're doing everything you're supposed to be doing with this community service thing, then I will consider the dance. - You know I love you, right? - Yes. And I'm only doing this for your own good. Yeah, I know. Could've been worse. Thank you, Mom. I was talking about your lecture, darling. Emma. Emma? Emma, wait up. I'm sorry. I mean, we should have never driven out there in the first place. It's fine. I just need to get through with this and move on with my life. It's not gonna, you know, affect college applications, right? No misses and I can never be late. Go. Don't worry about me. I have to get to "work." Today's my first day. - Good luck. - Thanks. Just 30 more days, that's all I'm asking for. You must be Emma. I'm Kevin. I'm the head horse trainer here, at Red Bucket. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You ever been around horses? You ever pet one? Maybe at the fair? Rode a pony once. Any pets? A little puppy, does that count? No. But you're here, and that does. Emma, welcome to the ranch the horses own. What are they doing? This is what we like to call "Charm Farm." This is where we take the babies and we get 'em accustomed to living in everyday life. It's a... It's kinda like school. Isn't that right, Cammie? We found Cammie and the other two starving to death in a ravine. And about 60 pounds of carrots and six hours later we were finally able to catch 'em. We've saved over 300 horses here at Red Bucket. Come with me, I wanna show you somethin'. This is Keely. She is the youngest member of the Red Bucket family. How're you doin'? How're you doin'? Come here. Come around here. Wild, tame, well-bred, pregnant... As soon as a horse is discarded and forgotten, they're taken to auction and sometimes they meet a terrible end. Fortunately for Keely here, we were able to save her in time, but her momma wasn't as lucky. She was taken to auction and bought by some greedy men who sent her to slaughter. - That's awful. - Yeah. You wanna give her a treat? - Okay. - Yeah? Hold out your hand. Look. All right. So, look, I don't really know what you did, kid. All I know is, they told me to put you in here. So, you're gonna scoop this up like this, all right? And you're gonna put it in here. Okay? You got it? Good. When you're done with this stall, I want you to work down the line until the whole barn's finished. When you're done doing that, you spread these around. Thirsty there, cowgirl? There's a faucet by the arena if you wanna cool off. Hey, have you met Emma? - Yeah. - Yeah, hi, I'm... Well, Lexi is actually our most experienced rider here. She came here two years ago to serve out her community service and really haven't been able to get rid of her since. Pretty much. Nice meetin' you. I'll finish this up later. Come with me. He's not gonna bite you. I'd rather not find out. He... Emma. For surviving your first day. Thanks. Did we do the right thing? Where you goin', Horse Girl? You guys, it's our fault that she's in this situation right now. We're just playing. She knows that. Right, Emma? Of course. Sorry, I'm just really tired. You know what we need? A girls' night. What do you say we TP a few houses this weekend? - Cool, I'm down. - Me, too. Yeah, not only am I Horse Girl, I'm also grounded. Someone's having too much fun. Don't get the wrong idea. I'm only here because I have to be. I see. Hey, Lexi? How can it be worth it, owning a horse, I mean? It's so much work. You've never ridden before, have you? Well, when you do, you'll see. It's one of the most exhilarating things you can experience. I mean, having a horse as your best friend and partner... There's nothing like it. No, I have no desire to ride. I just wanna get in and out of here with the least amount of manure on my shoes. That's my goal. Lexi, Susan needs you. Easy. Easy. Easy. Good boy. Good boy. Good boy. Easy. Yep, you got him. I got you. Good boy. That's a good boy. Look what I got for you. This is your home. Want some of that? You'll get so much more of it. There you go. Hello, beautiful. You're home now. You're gonna get a bucket. We're gonna get you a nameplate. Is he gonna be okay? He's so wild, how will he ever get adopted? It's gonna take a lot of work, no doubt. Depends on how much abuse he's endured and how long it'll take him to heal. Look at those pretty eyes. No offense, but what's it to you? I mean, you're not gonna be around to see what happens anyways. Do you want a treat? Okay. Easy, boy. That wasn't so bad. Not bad at all, Emma. Not bad at all. You gonna help me clean this up? All right. Fine. I'll clean up and you stay put. You can't let anyone know this happened. Would you believe he used to not let anyone touch him? To this day, he only lets me ride him. But we're working on that, aren't we? Back in the day, he used to be a great champion. He won his owners thousands of dollars. They tossed him aside when he stopped responding to their novel training techniques. Didn't they? You must be Emma. I'm Susan Peirce. I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you yesterday. The Susan I owe my life to? Well, I wouldn't say your whole life. In the show world, this guy is known as The Chancellor. But we just call him Chance. Right, buddy? He doesn't have a nameplate because we have to keep moving him around. - He gets bored easily. - I've noticed. The way I see it, everyone needs a second chance. Right, mister? Look at him. He's so kind and gentle. You'd never believe he's a dirty stopper. Instead of bucking a rider off, a dirty stopper will slam on the brakes right before a jump and then just throw the rider forward. Horses are a lot like people. They're highly intelligent and fiercely loyal. When they wanna be. Right, boy? I've got an extra pair of boots if you wanna borrow 'em. Probably not your style, but they'll keep your shoes clean. That would be amazing. Thank you. I'm sorry, I gotta take this. But the horses and I appreciate your help, Emma. This is Susan. Dirty stopper? I've never done this before. First time for everything. Maybe this isn't a good idea. Don't make me pull you out of there. Come on, okay? We'll have you back in two hours. How can you resist that puppy dog face? Pretty please? Hang on. - What are you doing? - I'm coming. No. I mean, why are you doing this? I mean, you're gonna get in so much trouble, more than you already are. My mom. You know, you don't need to come. You can catch us on the next one. Okay. Have a good night. Thanks, Meg. She's not coming, guys. What? We didn't just drive all the way out here for nothing. What a lame-o. She really is a goody two-shoes. Come on, guys. Good boy. - How's he feel? - Pretty good. A little rusty, but he'll get there. Emma! I didn't see you there. When are we throwing you up in the saddle? Me? Ride? Who's that? Wade Thompson. A guy gunning to buy this place. What's he want with Red Bucket? The land, the horsemeat. Who knows? He's been after it for years. Most of these horses come from auctions where guys like Thompson just snag 'em up and sell them to Mexico for profit. They're called "kill buyers." Consider my offer, Susan. You've got a lot of nerve coming here. It's a lot better than the inevitable. You won't be able to save 'em all. But it's better than losing the herd. It's going to be a shame watching your last six years of work go to waste. It's about time for you to leave. Ma'am. Is everything all right? Just another day on a horse rescue ranch. Red Bucket gets herself in the occasional pickle. But she always finds her way out. Right, sweetheart? Half a little cup of this, it's called Senior. Hey, buddy. Yeah, there we go. Don't tell. Red Bucket, the ranch the horses own. Would you like to make a donation today? Good, right? I know what you're up to, Emma. I can explain. She peels the crust off her sandwiches and hides it in her lunch sack. I never knew you to be the sandwich police, Lexi. Seriously, though. What do you think you're doing with Chance? You're only teaching him bad habits. - I didn't mean anything. - I get it. You're excited. Happens to everyone. They show up, stick around for a bit. Wait till they feel really good about themselves and then the pixie dust settles and poof. They disappear, never to return. I've seen your type a thousand times. You know, you can be... Not a very nice person. Have you ever thought that's why maybe people "poof and disappear"? You think she can handle it? I think so. She's been coming in early and staying late. Plus with Lexi prepping for a show, I'm a little short-handed. Well, if you think she's not gonna get herself hurt. Remember what happened the last time we took a "scared horse kid" under our wings. - Nope. Understood. - Okay. - I gotta take this. - Okay. Hello? I'm running behind today. I'm gonna need you to prep Rubix for me. All right. Brush him. No. It's like this. Good. There you go. Now. Lean into him. Lean into him. See this, right? Okay. Just like this. Good. Good. Where're you headed? I have four more stalls to clean. No, today and tomorrow I need you here. Helping me groom and tack up the horses. All right? That's right. Today and tomorrow. And every day after that. Come on. Emma! Hey, what's going on with you? Why haven't you been to any of our games? I have this thing called community service, remember? Right. Sorry. Are you gonna be at the dance at least? Yeah. I wouldn't miss it. Cool. Hey, sorry. One more thing. Is there any chance you have the chapter summaries done for English? I'll hit you back when the season's over. I just, I'm so... - Yeah, sure. - Thank you so much. You know what? I actually left them at home. You know what? Don't worry about it. You are the best! And I will get them from you later, okay? - Okay. - See ya. Mr. Jordan! Mr. Jordan, hey, about that assignment? - I'll have it to you by tomorrow, seriously. - It was due last Thursday. Come on! Are you playing with me? Come on! Amateur hour over here. Okay. There we go. I know, bud. Good boy. Seriously? You too? Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. Chance is next. So, this is it. Do me a favor and make us look good, okay? All right. I'll make a deal with you. All right? Okay. What, you're not gonna stomp your feet at me? Okay. I know. I owe you big time. All right. Thanks. Come on. Come on! What's up, Chance? Kevin doesn't bite. - What are... - Let me. Not a word. Come on. Come on. Looks like Buddy Boy's trying to tell us somethin'. I think he wants you to ride him. All right. Me? Yeah. I'm gonna let you sit up there and if I think you can handle it then I might allow you to take him to a walk. - But what about the... - Fact that he only lets Susan ride him? Looks like he's had a change of mind. Come on. Proof he likes you. I'm sorry, boy. I've never done this before. He knows. All right now. Hey. Are you kidding me? You're doing this to me now after all the history we have together? Emma, he wants you to cluck to him. Yeah. Yeah. Cluck, cluck. Cluck, cluck. I'll be. I don't get it. Why is he letting me ride him? The real test will be if he dirty stops ya. Which is not gonna happen because you're not going over any jumps. Did he dirty stop Susan? - A couple times. - Be nice. Kidding. Please no dirty stops. Please don't dirty stop me. Please don't dirty stop me. That-a-way, Emma. Good. Good, Emma. That-a-way. Good. Emma, honey! What about the dance? I think I'm skipping it, Mom. Kinda busy right now. Okay. - I can't believe she's riding. - Me neither. You looked good today. Thanks. Hey. Hey. You haven't seen Emma anywhere, have you? She's probably at that horse place again. She's either there, or at home, or there. Which is totally your fault, by the way. My fault? You're the one that wanted to go there in the first place. This dance is lame. You wanna get outta here? Maybe some other time. There we go. - Guys, we've gotta go. No. Put that down. - What? Let's go. Yeah, take it. Take it. - Why are you so upset? - I don't wanna talk about it, Meg, okay? - Let's just go. - Are you sure you're okay? Yes. Kate! What did I say about that cookie? Can we go get pancakes? Where are we even going? Pancakes are not part of our diet, Meg. Hey, girls. Ms. Bailey, Emma's missing. We didn't see her at the dance and we're really worried about her. Emma isn't missing. She just went out with some friends from the Rescue. - But I thought she was grounded. - She was. Is, I mean. Tonight was an exception. I'm sorry, girls. I'll tell her you stopped by. Okay. - For a second I thought... - Don't push your luck. You guys. Hey. Jacob, what are you doing here? Well, I was just bored and I thought I'd come see how you were feeling. I'm feeling fine. Okay. I just thought, like, maybe you were sick or something 'cause you haven't... No, I'm not sick. Well anyway, I really need to talk to you about something. Hey, honey. I'm going to bed. - Don't stay up too late. - Okay. - What are you doing? - Admiring the moon. - Okay. - Good night. You were gonna ask me something? Yeah, I was gonna ask you... Those chapter summaries for English. Do you have them for me yet? 'Cause I just really need them. - Yeah. Right. - Awesome. Thank you so much. - Here. - Thank you. And also, I realize I never apologized to you about the other night. You really took the blame for us. I'm sorry. I should've never jumped that fence. But it's okay, it's turning out to be a good thing in a weird kinda way. So, no worries. Catherine was right. You're kinda turning into a horse girl. You know what they say about horse girls, right? They love horses more than boys? Yeah. Yeah, something like that. Okay. Well, see you Monday? Yeah, see you Monday. - All right. - Okay. You thinking about signing up? No. I'm just taking a picture so I remember when it is. Well, entries close soon. It's $120 to enter. And you and your horse have to be a member of the United States Equestrian Federation. After you're done with Rubix, Chance is next. Yeah, do you know where he is? Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doin'? Check your list, man. Chance ain't on it. Come on. Come on. Come on. There we go. You're a good boy. You're a good boy, yes, you are. You're a good boy. Yeah. He doesn't really like men much, does he? Aside from you, of course. No. It's gonna be next to impossible to find a female farrier, too. Well, I just got off the phone with your principal. You're welcome back any time. What's the matter? I thought you'd be relieved. I mean, I still feel really horrible about what happened. And I just, I don't know. I wish there was more I could do. I also want to officially apologize to you, Susan. And thank you. Thank you for giving me the chance to make it right. Emma, you are forgiven. Mr. Rogers and Pilot have made a full recovery. Isn't that right, Mr. Rogers? Can I come back every now and then? As long as you keep cleaning out stalls you can come back every day, if you like. - Thank you. - Thanks. Congratulations. I heard. So I guess this is when you poof and disappear? You better not. I got a lot of horses left to take care of around here. When I first came here, I thought this place was a joke. I just wanted to finish my community service and be done with it. But when I started to see how these horses get turned around... Especially the ones I helped train. I mean, seeing the look on a new owner's face when they adopt one, one you helped save. It changed me. I owe everything to Kevin and Susan. To Red Bucket. I have to admit, Emma. You surprised me in the best way possible. I'm sorry about what I said. And I hope you do stick around. Are you kidding? I'm addicted to this place. Good. Yeah, there you go! Arch your back now! Arch your back. Okay, can she be here tomorrow? - Yes, good! Good! Way to go! - There we go. - Can I ask you something? - Shoot. How do you know if a boy likes you or if he's just using you, like, for your brains? He's nice and cute and everything and every girl has a crush on him. Do you? You gotta be honest with him. You shouldn't let him or anyone use you for your brains... Or anything. Well, how much could we get for the back pasture? Yeah, we need to take the first offer that comes in. We gotta cut back. So, let's do about half grain and then do two thirds of a scoop of the electrolytes. And you can still do the same amount of oil... Hey, Lexi? If Red Bucket didn't exist, what would happen to the horses? Where would they go? Red Bucket does exist. Well, yeah, but what if it didn't? Like, what if it got sold or something? As long as Susan's here, this place will never sell. Yeah. Does she seem overly stressed to you? She's always like that. Mom, what's with spending money on all this junk food? Okay, health nut. Do you know how many horses we could feed with that? She has a point. Horses love donuts. - It's cute, right? - I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. - Well, sorry. Sorry. - Just do it again. No way. I thought she was done with her community service. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? - Nope, it's Horse Girl! - Horse Girl! You guys are mean. Come on. It was just a joke. You two are both just way too in love with your silly little selfies to think about anyone else. Are you sure this is a good idea? Just being honest. That wasn't so bad, was it? That was fun! Hey. You wanna tell me what's going on here? It's about time he let somebody else ride him. Chance was ready, if that's what this is about. Can anyone tell me what the acute angle of a parallelogram is? Emma? Try Horse Girl. She'll wake up to that. I'm sorry. Did you say acute or obtuse? Because one obtuse and acute angle of a parallelogram add up to 180 degrees and are known as supplementary angles. Did I understand the question correctly? What's your deal, Cat? Catherine! You did not just do that. You think you can expect everyone to do whatever you want. Follow you around like you're the boss of them? I can't wait for high school to be over. You wanna know why? Because everyone will have finally moved on from you. And you will finally know how it feels to be treated like... Like... Like horse manure! That's strange. Next month's hay hasn't come in yet. What is it? Okay. My first day here, I overheard Susan in her office. She was saying something about needing 30 more days. And then again the other day, I overheard her talking to someone about how much the back pasture would sell for... And asking whoever was on the phone to take the first offer that comes in. Susan would never sell. Yeah, but doesn't this explain why we're running out of hay and why she's been so stressed out? I asked her about the hay last week and she told me not to worry. We can't lose that pasture. Wait, Lexi. Can you really win money at these things? That's it! I have to enter into as many shows as possible and surely we can raise enough to get us through until we can figure something else out. Okay, we have to be really clever about how we do this. Here. I raised it for Red Bucket. Hey. - Hi, Susan. - Hi, girls. Thanks. Hey, bud. - There we go. - How are you doing, buddy? You girls are still here? Yeah, just felt like an evening ride. All right. - I'll let you both lock up then. - Yeah. Yeah. Good boy. You sure you don't need me. Almost done and headed home myself. Okay. Have fun. Come on, bud. Good boy! Just a minute, I'm looking for my keys. Someone's in a rush to clean stalls. If I finish early, I get to ride Chance. Well, I hope you realize what a gift it is them giving you lessons... - And saying thank you. - Mom, can we go already? Okay. Come on! How'd you think this plan of yours would work? You know what happens when you push the body too hard and you don't give yourself time to rest. If it's not broken, it's definitely fractured. What if we hosted a carnival, or something? No offense, kid, but that would not be enough. What about Emma? They're the best match here and you know it. Out of the question. We can come up with something better. Which is? Susan's in New York right now meeting with a donor. She'll come home with a check and everything will be fine. End of discussion. The best match here and you're not gonna let us even try? Forget she mentioned it. I'm not gonna put that kind of pressure on you, Emma. You know Chance would never let her down. I can handle it! You have two weeks to get her ready. I'll come every day and train. And if I'm not ready, then we won't go through with it. Kevin? Fine. If you're not ready though, I'm gonna pull the plug. And listen to me. I'm gonna be the one to tell Susan. So until that point, this stays just between us. Okay. Lexi! Am I hurting you? - I'm sorry. - It's okay. She's as ready as she'll ever be. Bye, bud. Yeah, I know, Chance. Me, too. I don't get it. I tried to tell her. You didn't tell her. Tell me what? Daddy? He's my favorite. Please, can we get him? I don't want to bother you with all that's been going on. Plus, you wouldn't have gone for it anyway. Yeah, of course I wouldn't go for it. How is Emma any different than any of the other troubled kids we've had here? How can you put the ranch at risk like this? I thought we believed in second chances. I only wanted to help. We wanted to win so we could give the prize money to Red Bucket. Well, that's nice of you. But you don't have to do that. Red Bucket'll be fine. But I overheard you. Talking to someone on the phone about selling the back pasture. Please let me do this show with Chance. I know we can win. I can handle it. I appreciate your enthusiasm. But you don't understand the pressure. You'll be competing against girls like Lexi. Tough girls. And horses can sense fear. Chance will want to please you - but you're gonna have to be so... - I can do it, Susan. Please. Under one condition. You tell Chance that I still get to ride him every now and again. - Okay? - Deal. What have I gotten myself into? - Okay, that's enough. That's enough. - Thank you. Wake up, honey! You don't wanna be late! Mom! I'm coming! Okay. Let's go. Welcome to the Summer Classic Junior Jamboree, featuring Junior Hunter Grand Championship $10,000 dollar stake. Next you go study your course map. We have to go outside the arena? You mean you've never done a work off before? Instead of bucking a rider off, a dirty stopper will slam on the brakes right before a jump and then just throw the rider forward. All right. Thanks. Wade put an offer in on the back pasture. I gotta take it, Kevin. What about the savings account? I thought we had three weeks left. I had to dip into it when the donor from last week backed out. I've been dialing for dollars. Take my salary. No. We're out of options. Selling will give us room to breathe. I just wish, you know, we'd get caught up but... What can I say? We're at the end of our rope. I'm not gonna let him win. - Is she any good? - Doesn't look like it. Nice boots. Hey. Don't you be intimidated. All right? They're good, but we're better. It's time to warm up. You take a moment. - I'll meet you over by the warm-up arena. - Okay. Catherine, what are you doing here? Here to see my friend kill it out there. And to apologize. I've been a brat to you and everyone around me. And I'm glad you called me out on it. Will you forgive me? I don't know. Kidding. By the way, you look hot. Thanks. I'm glad you're here, Cat. Head up. You're all right. He's just being competitive. You gotta trust him. Entering the arena, number 845! Isn't that right, boy? Irish Willow ridden by Beth Campbell, owned by Beth Campbell. Two away from 848. All right. Come on. Number 501 in the ring for the Junior Hunter Grand Championship. Number 848, we need you at the gate. All right. Now, listen. This is your moment. That's your partner. Do your job. We hit 'em when they least expect it. Number 836, Katrine with rider Anne Thompson, owner, Wade Thompson. Entering the arena, number 848, The Chancellor, ridden by Emma Bailey, owned by Red Bucket. The more relaxed you are, the more relaxed he's gonna be, Emma. Two away from number 850. Emma. Red vertical. Red vertical, red vertical. Come on. What is she doing? Come on, Emma. Okay. She's back on track. No matter what, you're a champion. In third place, number 849, Prince Caspian with rider Jamie Gable, owner Jamie Gable. In second place, number 836, Katrine with rider Anne Thompson, owner Wade Thompson. I'm sorry, Chance. It's my fault. And in first place, number 848, The Chancellor, with rider Emma Bailey, owner Red Bucket! I can't believe you know how to do all that. Yeah, Emma. Complete domination. You too, Chance. So, what are you gonna do now that you're rich? I say that you splurge on a new wardrobe. I second that. I say how about putting it away for college? No. This belongs to Red Bucket. No, honey. That's very sweet. But your mom is right. This money goes into your college fund. But that wasn't the agreement. I said you could ride him and that's all. This money doesn't belong to us. It belongs to Chance. Beginner's luck, I guess. I hope we can compete again, Emma Bailey. That is, if you still have a stable to train at. I look forward to going into escrow with you this week. You're selling the pasture to him? Definitely not feeling the warm fuzzies right now. Yeah, seriously. What's the deal with Mr. Fancy Pants and his protg? Bring your horse in, ma'am, let's go. The next horse in is lot number 801. This is a seven-year-old mare, sorrel colored. Don't know if she runs or not. But she's a worker, guys. Final call. Going once. Going twice. Sold there. $1,000. 371. 371 is the buyer, $1,000 is the price. - Come here. Yummy, yum. - Yeah. Yeah. Bit of advice for you ladies. Do something meaningful with your young lives. Saving horses ain't gonna take you anywhere. Everybody knows you can't save them all. Maybe you're right. But today we saved these ones. Excuse me. I'm looking for Wade Thompson? Yes, I'm Wade Thompson. - Sir, I need to bring you in for questioning. - What for? Illegal trafficking of livestock over the Mexican border. Well, this is absurd! At least we'll sleep well tonight! - We wait two days. - Right, two days. 'Cause I don't know... Is this where the fiesta is happening? No, you have the wrong address. Nope, this is the right place. You can park it over there, sir. Thank you, come again. Emma, what is going on? You're not selling, Susan. We won't let you. What is happening? Hopefully, it's enough to get you caught up and then some. The rest is to cover expenses for the horses Emma picked up at the auction day with her prize money. You girls. I told my dad I didn't need any more summer trips. Took some convincing. But he finally caved in. You saved us, young lady. I now understand why I lost my best friend these past two months. You guys are like family. - That we are. - Come here. Let's get this party started. Hey, what are you doing here? Free food. She really came through for us today. Yeah, true story. Whoever ends up with her is one lucky guy. Emma! Just the girl I was looking for. Jacob, listen, if this is about paying back the favor or copying again, I really don't... No, no. I actually wanted to thank you. We're getting something to eat. Do you wanna join? I can't. I have somewhere I need to be. But you guys have fun. I'll see you later? - Sure. - See ya. You've never ridden before, have you? Well, when you do, you'll see. I mean, having a horse as your best friend and partner, there's nothing like it. I'll make a deal with you. I promise to find you a good home. Please, Daddy, can we adopt him? Seeing the look on the new owner's face when she adopted him... One I helped save... It changed me. I'm not sad. I'm really not. I'm happy. I'm happy for Chance. Me, too. Now, let's go save some more horses.
