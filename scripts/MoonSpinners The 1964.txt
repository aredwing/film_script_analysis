No, hold on. We're bound to be there in a minute. Here. Concentrate madly on something else. It's all mental. That fish isn't. Change places with me. There's a bit of air from the window. I say... I wonder if you'd be so kind... as to put that somewhere else? The fish... could you put it somewhere? It's a bit strong. Girl: Could you put it somewhere else? I don't knowwhy one always thinks... foreigners will suddenly understand English... if one shouts. Fran, I don't think I can manage. I'm sure it's just around the next corner. Try reciting The Jabberwocky. Think of it on the printed page... and force yourself to remember the illustrations. "'Twas brillig..." BOTH: "And the slithy toves did gyre and gimble." Quick. The smelling salts. (Honks horn) Aghios Georgios! Thank heaven. That's us. (Speaking Greek) Excuse me. Come on. I'm... I'm terribly sorry. Please forgive me. Aghios Georgios! We're coming! Nikky! Excuse me! Ooh. (Speaking Greek) FRAN: Nikky, come on! I'm coming! Now, have we got everything? Suitcases, knapsacks, tape recorder... (Speaking Greek) Oh. Aghios Georgios? (Speaking Greek) Aghios Georgios. (Door slams) (Music playing) (People singing in Greek, clapping hands in rhythm) Cousin Orestes, visitors from England! (Speaking Greek) (Speaking Greek) ORESTES: You are welcome to my wedding. (Speaking Greek) (Singing in Greek) Hey, missis, my hotel! Stratos, they're here. Will you come down? I'm busy. But I need your help. I said I was busy. Will you leave this for once? Orestes is our cousin. They're all expecting you. I came back because I had work to do. All I want is some peace and quiet. You didn't come back for love of your family... or your village. That much is certain. What do you mean by that? You suddenly appear from London. You don't want to see anyone. You don't want me to take any visitors. You and this Englishman watch each other like cat and mouse. You're very observant, aren't you, little sister? You fill your head with this... stars, fortunes, astrology. I warn you again. Stay out of my business. If you do, you'll have all the money you need. If you don't... This make money? More than you ever dreamed of. How? w? By keeping one step ahead of chance. Always one step ahead. Chance or the law? w? Go and see to your guests. Out, you hear? You better go to the church sometimes. Those are works of the devil. Out! (Speaking Greek) (Speaking Greek) (Crowd chattering, music playing) Thank you. Look, the Moon-Spinners. What does that mean, Alexis? Is old song... very old song. Mama, visitors from England. 2 nice old ladies. How do you do? I'm Frances Ferris. Did you get our telegram? Telegram? I sent it yesterday from Heraklion. There was no telegram. But that's incredible. Nikky, you didn't... I sent it myself. The man at the post office translated it. Well, I'm sorry. Well, I asked you to reserve us 2 rooms for a few days. This is my niece. This hotel is not open for visitors. Mama! (Speaking Greek) Please! I can see we've arrived at a bad moment... but you've simply got to put us up somewhere. I was not expecting you. Will you excuse me, please? Well, I'm not going to be beaten. Look here. Could you at least... find us a room in the village? I'm sorry, but I have a great many guests. Mama, why don't you give them... one of the empty rooms? Have you got empty rooms? We're absolutely exhausted. We can't possibly go back... all the way to Heraklion tonight. If you don't give us one of those rooms... wedding or no wedding... I shall sleep right here on the floor. Please. Well, take the ladies upstairs. They can have number 3. (Speaking Greek) Jolly good show! Come, I show you. As for dinner, I will see. Anything. Even a sandwich. I shall require 2 normal 3-course dinners. Thank you. Aunt, really. (Speaking Greek) Is very best room. Nice beds, nice table, nice chairs. Hey, missis. Nice expansion. Yes, it is. It's a very nice expansion, indeed. Well, at least it's clean. Hmm. Why was your mother so set against us staying here? It's Uncle Stratos. Since he come back from London... he don't like no one... but I like you both, so everything OK. Wait a minute. Thank you very much. No. You crazy or something? Thank you, missis. If there's anything that you want, you just ask Alexis. Uncle Stratos, visitors from England. Good afternoon. What are you doing here? FRANCES: We've come to stay... if you have no objection. She has let you the room? This is a hotel, isn't it? I mean, it is the custom in Crete... to let room to visitors, or am I mistaken? How did you hear of Aghios Georgios? FRANCES: Someone told us at the hotel in Heraklion. I'm a musicologist. I collect folk songs. What kind of songs do you expect to find here? Um, the song that this hotel is called after, for one. Now, do you mind? We'd like to rest. All right. You can spend the night here. FRANCES: That's extremely kind of you. Couldn't we at least have a bath? There is no bath here. Alexis will give you water to wash in if you wish... or else there is the sea. There is a bus leaving for Isle Mykonos tomorrow. (Speaking Greek) Swell. Really. My Uncle Stratos is much lousy man. I bring you water. Lousy is the word! Well, if that's an example... of Cretan hospitality, l... (Both laugh) Oh, it's so awful. It's hilarious. Oh, well, at least it couldn't be any worse. Oh, darling, I am sorry. I promise that we'll spend a week... in Cannes on the way home... and we'll dress up... and go to all the galas and be madly gay. But you knowwhat's going to be the final blow? w? The one available Englishman... will be some... some moth-eaten old professor... about 75 who's only interested in ruins. Well, he'll have one here ready-made. (Dramatic music playing) Thanks, Lambis. You went to the Bay of Dolphins? Huh? Yes. Skin diving? Yes. The water's so clear you could see everything. And how much did you see? Hmm? It was you, wasn't it, out in that boat watching me? Don't be so shy next time. I'll give you a diving lesson. Aunt Fran, don't you think we ought to dress for dinner... to sort of honor the bride? Yes. (Man singing in Greek) There he is. There he is! Who? The old Englishman. & La la la-la-la la la la & Oh, he's charming. You go in. I don't want to be first. Good evening. Good evening. You must be the two old English... Hmm? You must be the two old English ladies... Alexis told me about. Have you been here long? Um... Whew! I'm Mark Camford. Frances Ferris. How do you do? My niece Nikky. - Hello. - Good evening. I thought, perhaps, since everyone was celebrating, we might have dinner together. - We'd love to. - Yes! What a pleasant surprise. I had Alexis keep us a table outside. - All right? - Yes. I bring you dinner. Same as them. Oh, thank you, Alexis. Sweet. Is this the first time you've been to Greece? We spent a week in Athens before coming here. Uh-huh. Have you been to Athens? Mmm. It's fabulous, isn't it, the Acropolis and everything? I mean, it's so exactly like the Acropolis. I wish they could stick it all together again... don't you? Have you been here long? Hmm? No, no. Not very, no. It's a quaint little place. Dead quiet as a rule. I'm surprised Uncle Stratos let you stay. He practically threw us out. I mean, I can't understand why he has... such a very odd attitude to visitors, can you? He's a very odd one, Uncle Stratos. Do you know he devours books on astrology? Strong with charms and fetishes like a witch doctor. It'd take a witch doctor to improve his manners. (Laughs) V ery good olives. I make myself. Ah, let's see. - Have some octopus. - Aah! (Music playing) These English women... what are they doing here? They're friends of Camford? I don't know. I told them they must leave tomorrow. He was skin diving very, very near. I know, I know. Stratos, why are you playing this game? You knowwho he is, what he came for. Why you do not send him away? I don't want to send him away, Lambis. What are you going to do? There will be decisive developments tonight. Look at Alexis. Isn't he wonderful? Do you like to dance? Oh, I love it. I'm like the girl in the red shoes. Once I start, I can go on and on and on until I drop. (Song ends, crowd cheers) Are there any dances that women can join in, too? Oh, yes. FRANCES: I do wish you'd tell us... why this hotel is called the Moon-Spinners. It's such an unusual name. It is a legend. Who are the Moon-Spinners? Three sisters who spin the full moon. Doesn't the legend have to do with the Bay of Dolphins? Alexis told me there was supposed to be... a sunken ship laden with treasure. Really? In Crete, there are many old tales. I understand when the moon is full... you're supposed to be able to see... the treasure at the bottom of the bay. Do you think there's any treasure... in the Bay of Dolphins? There are sharks... and many dangerous octopus among the rocks. Sharks! Yes. I warned you before not to go swimming there. I see you quite often out there in your boat. Let us hope I do not fish you out one day... without an arm or a leg. My cousin Orestes. My very good friends from London. How do you do? You like to meet Ariadne please? Oh, we'd love to. Yes! Oh, you look so pretty. Tell her how pretty she looks. How do you do? Would you mind if I gave her... that scarf you bought me in Athens? What a good idea! I'll be back in a minute. Be a dear and bring me my tape recorder. OK! Oh, thank you very much. (Dramatic music playing) (Gasps) What are you doing? I'm sorry. l... I came up here to get some of my books. This used to be my room, you know. Well, there were no books in here. Well, I said I was sorry. Oh, by the way, it's quite a coincidence... your meeting an old friend here. What old friend? Mr. Camford. We never saw him before until tonight. Oh, well, have a very pleasant evening, Miss Ferris. (Music playing) (Laughs) I'm sorry, Alexis. I haven't the dimmest idea what I'm doing. Hey, you're pretty good. I think you do this before. Ha ha! It's a wonderful rhythm. If only I knew the steps. Who cares about the steps? We're inventing a dance all our own. Opa! Opa! (Both laugh) He's watching again. Oh, he's always on the lookout for something. There's something sinister about the whole family... except little Alexis. And who's that sullen young man... who's always hanging about? Oh, that's cousin Lambis. He helps around the inn. Well, l... Ha ha! Well, I think they're all up to something. How'd you like to go swimming tomorrow? w? Oh, I'd love to. Where? MARK: We'll go to the Bay of Dolphins. What about the sharks? Oh, that's all nonsense. We'll take lunch and make a day of it. Wonderful. What do you say? Shall we shatter tradition and really let go? Yes. (Tempo speeds up) (Song ends, crowd cheers) (People singing in Greek, clapping hands in rhythm) Good night, Mr. Camford. Good night, Miss Ferris. Where are they all going? Hmm? They're singing the bride and groom to bed. It's a local custom. Can we go? Look, you must have had an awfully long day. Don't you think you ought to turn in? Then we can get an early start tomorrow? w? I am quite tired, actually. Ahh. It turned into a lovely evening. Good. That's the nicest way for things to happen... when they come as a surprise. - Good night. - Good night. Shall I meet you about half past 9:00 tomorrow? w? Uh-huh. Look at the moon. (Dramatic music playing) I don't think at home it ever seems... so huge and so close. The Moon-Spinners must be working full-time tonight. I think that's what I shall become. I can't think of a lovelier way... of spending my life... than spinning that silver light. You're quite a romantic, aren't you? No, it's unusual nowadays. Good night. Good night, Mark. Mr. Camford! You're so fond of the Bay of Dolphins. Would you care to come night-fishing with me? That's very good of you, Stratos. No, thanks. It's great fun, you know. Oh, I'm sure. Some other time, perhaps? Some other time, perhaps. Happy harpooning. (Dog barking in distance) Oh, Fran, honestly. Tell me honestly. Do think I'll ever have... what the magazines call "allure"? You've got the best of all qualities. You're completely yourself. Oh, I don't think that's such an advantage. Oh, look at me. I wish I could do something to my face. How about this? Too old. Yeah. This? (Chuckles) Too young. (Sighs) It's... it's... you see, it's this being... so terribly in between... that makes it so difficult. He said I was a romantic. Nowadays, that's one step... from being told you're a drip. Don't rush it, darling. You've only met the man once. Oh, I know... but I said all the wrong things... talked a blue streak, as usual. NIKKY: You know, I hear myself. Yakkity-yakkity-yak. I can't stop. (Sighs) Oh, well. Well, he must have liked you. NIKKY: Why? He wouldn't have asked you to go swimming. He is nice, isn't he? V ery. You sound undecided. He's charming. I think he's a little mysterious. Why? I don't know. Just an impression. Oh, turn out the light, will you? (Dramatic music playing) I do love you, Aunt Fran. Thank you for always being there. FRANCES: Good night, my darling. (Turns off engine) (Rocks falling) Aah! (Starts engine) Good morning. Good morning, Nikky. Oh, Alexis, could I have some of that... to take with me this morning? Lovely day, isn't it? You must be tired after such a big wedding. It was a wonderful dinner, too... really wonderful. Thank you. Oh, I hate to bother you... but could I have some tea or coffee? I don't have tea. I'll make you coffee. My aunt's still sleeping. Is Mr. Camford down yet? Mr. Camford? Yes. We're going swimming this morning. Um... I wondered if he was anywhere about. SOPHIA: He's gone. Gone? Where? To Heraklion. He left by the early bus. But he can't have. Didn't he leave a message or a note or anything? No, nothing. Oh, but l... Thank you. (Dramatic music playing) (People chattering) (Bird cawing) (Door creaks) (Exhales noisily) Aah! (Labored breathing) Mark. Mark? Mark, it's Nikky. (Grunts) Oh, uh... (Whispering) Hello. (Whispering) What are you doing here? They said you'd gone. I, um... (Whispering) I'm... I must have fallen asleep. Your arm. What's happened? I'm sorry I stood you up. Ohh! Wait a minute. What time is it? About half past 10:00. Thank you. They said you'd gone to Heraklion... but I felt something was wrong. How did you get in here? I remember crawling in just... just before dawn. (Sighs) Sorry. I'll go get some help. No, Nikky, listen. Please listen. Did you have a fight with someone? Look, if you want to help me... go back to the inn and bring me some clothes. Anything. And... and, uh... something to eat. I've got to get out of here. You must see a doctor first. - I'll get Aunt Fran. - Nikky... And then we'll find some people... to carry you back. Will you please listen? I don't want anyone to know you found me here. Not anyone. Not even your aunt. Do you understand? But Mark, someone's tried to kill you. We must get the police. The last thing I want at the moment is the police. Please... tell me what happened. You'll find some clothes in my room. And if you can... swipe a bottle of brandy from the bar. I'm cold all over. Here. Oh... l... I always fancied myself in pink. Mark? You've got to tell me. Was it Stratos? Look... either do as I ask or beat it... 'cause I haven't got the strength to explain. All right. I'Il... I'll be back as soon as I can. OK. Good girl. (Dramatic music playing) (Footsteps) (Door creaks) (Footsteps) (Breathing heavily) (Music playing) (Women singing The Moon-Spinnerss in Greek) (Singing in Greek) (Women clapping in rhythm) (Clapping intensifies) (Clapping and music fades) (Birds cawing) Mr. Stratos, may I speak to you? Go ahead. Please don't misunderstand me... but I've just been up to my room. My travelling rug appears to have vanished. Oh? It was folded across the bed. I wonder if you've any idea... what might have become of it. Travelling rug? Ask my sister. Also my first aid kit. First aid kit? FRANCES: In a box which was so big... with iodine and bandages. One never uses it... but I always take it with me... in case of emergencies. Emergencies? Perhaps your niece took these things... with her this morning. It's hardly likely that she'd take... a travelling rug on a day like this. And I doubt whether she's in any need of bandages. Do you know where she went? Mr. Camfordpromised to take her swimming. I suppose she must have gone off somewhere alone. Mr. Camford. Yes. He always went to the Bay of Dolphins. I will look into this matter at once. If she has not your things, I will ask in the village. Don't worry. They will be returned. (Dramatic music playing) Mark? Mark? - Hmm? - (Gasps) (Sighs) What on earth are you doing in there? Well, at least it's not so drafty as that floor. (Panting) Here. Oh, brandy. Nikky, you are marvelous. Oh, Mark, I've had an awful time. All your things have vanished. Your room was completely bare. Oh, I should've guessed that. Mark, will you please get out of that thing? It gives me the absolute creeps. (Grunting) - Mind your head. - Yeah. It's all right. All right. Sit here. Come here. Come. Sit down there. Oh, found your shoe on the beach. Oh, marvelous. (Sighs) Now let's see. Ow. Oh. - Careful. - Yes, yes, all right. There. See? It's all right. Crikey. Hope I can remember what to do. I was always bottom at first aid at school. That's encouraging. Um... it was the reverse spiral... and repeat figure 8. In cases of multiple fracture... I'm not multiply fractured yet. All right. Now keep calm. I am calm. You better have some more brandy. This is bound to hurt. Mmm! Oh, don't do that! (Grunts) I wonder if there's anything in there... I ought to dig out. Look, whatever's in there, leave it. Now hold that. That's right. Don't move it. Did Stratos actually try to kill you? Don't ask questions. He almost caught me at the inn just now. I nearly fainted. Are you sure he didn't see you? No. No. I'm sure he didn't. All right. Please tell me what happened. I don't want you to become involved. You've got to go to the police. If he finds you, he might try it again. Well, look, that's my affair. Now... nowwhat you've gotta do, uh... is... is clear out of Aghios Georgios. You see? You take the afternoon bus... with your aunt to Aghios Nikolaos. Do you understand? Now put that down... put that down. But why us? You're the one who's in trouble. If he knew you've been helping me... he might take a potshot at you. Mark, whatever is going on? You've got to get out of here. Well, I'm not gonna leave you here like this. You need help. You've given me all the help I need. Just stop ordering me about! Up the steps. March! - Hurry up. Come on. - Mark! Will you please be reasonable? You look wretched and white. You'll only faint in the sun or fall off a cliff. I'm perfectly OK, Nikky. Thank you for everything you've done. See you at Aunt Agatha's next Tuesday. Mark! Scram! (Grunts) You deserve to die a horrible, lingering death... and I hope you do! MARK: Beat it! (Slams) (Dramatic music playing) (Gasps) Ah, Miss Ferris. Your aunt has been worried about you. Oh, I'm on my way back to the inn now. Where have you been all morning? Looking for rocks. I collect rocks. You carry them in that? Sometimes. If I happen to find a lot. Rocks can be very heavy. How many did you find this morning? Not many. In fact, none. Well, I mustn't be late for lunch, must I? Who needed this, Miss Ferris? Well... (Sighs) As a matter of fact... I wasn't actually looking for rocks. Well, that is, I was at first. But then I went up there into the hills... and I came across this shepherd... who'd broken his leg. He'd slipped and broken his leg. Ah... Oh, the poor man was lying out there with nothing... so of coursse I had to do something. Up... up in the hills? Uh-huh. Uh, look. Up there. He was awfully grateful. He was an awfully nice shepherd... very old... Well, you show me where you left him. I will make arrangements... to have him carried back to the village. Oh, he could walk. He walked away. He's quite all right now. He walked? With a broken leg? Yes. Well, good-bye. Mr. Stratos, uh... really, he's all right. Perhaps it wasn't completely broken. I think we should make sure, don't you? No. He's gone home with his sheep. When a shepherd breaks his leg... he always goes into this church to pray. It's an old tradition in Aghios Georgios. Oh... Mr. Stratos, I promise you. He went over the mountains to... You are a very bad liar! You're also a very stupid girl. You've come to see the beauties of Crete? Let me show you one. Let me go! Leave me alone! Let me go! (Click) You see? There's no one here. Mark! Mark, look out! How much did he tell you, huh? Answer me. How much do you know? w? (Donkey braying) Did you see her? Well, she was not on the beach. She must have gone up into the hills. It's a beautiful day. It's so unlike her not to have let me know. I'm, uh, going shooting in those hills with Lambis. If we see her there, we'll tell her... that you were worried. Oh, I don't mind... so long as she's all right. Hey, bon appetit, Mrs. Ferris. Tonight, if we are lucky... you will have quail for dinner. Quail? It is a local dish... stuffed with mushrooms and thyme. Extremely tasty. It sounds delicious. Yes. So? These are guns. You've seen guns before. I'm going shooting. Something has happened. Eh? Did you tell me the truth this morning? The truth? About Mr. Camford. I must know. I must know what is going on. You know what I tell you. That is enough. No, it's not enough. You tell me Mr. Camford left... with the early bus. Why? Why? Why should I know? w? He's a visitor. He comes and goes as he chooses. I did not hear him leave. Why should you hear? He left quietly so as not to disturb anyone. And now these guns. (Grunts) I don't understand. I'm afraid. Please, Stratos, whatever happened... tell me the truth. Mr. Camford went to Heraklion. Miss Ferris lost her way. I am going to shoot quail. What is the matter with you? Someone must have taken these things. Yes, the children in the village... the devil himself. What do I care? (Dramatic music playing) I think after lunch... I'll walk along the beach and look for her. I suppose you didn't find out anything... about my things. (Breathing heavily) STRATOS: I'll watch the bay. You take the high country. Search. Find him. This time, when you shoot, shoot to kill. (Recorder playing) (Whispering) Alexis! (Stops playing) Over here! Camford! For crying out loud! What are you doing up here? They said you'd gone to Heraklion. Listen, Alexis... are you my friend? Nay, nay, but what are you doing up here? Can you keep a secret? Go back to the inn and see if Nikky and her aunt... have caught the afternoon bus to Aghios Nikolaos. I want to be sure they've caught that bus... you understand? But what's up? You and uncle Stratos make pretty big stink, eh? You bring me news about Nikky. Quick, like a mouse. Then you're still my friend? I think pretty lousy thing... when you go and no good-bye. Of course we're friends... the best. Now off you go. I bring you word. (Sheep bleating) (Bells jingling) Aah! NIKKY: Aah! Hello! ALEXIS: Did somebody scream? Alexis?! It's Nikky! Help! For crying out loud, what you doing in there? Get me out of here, Alexis! I'll get Mr. Camford! We get you out all right! Has my niece come back? - No. - Then it's true. She must've had an accident. Perhaps she went walking in the hills. She's been gone all day! (Speaking Greek) Don't you understand? Anything may have happened. She may be lying out there somewhere hurt. Did you find her? She has not returned? I'm terribly worried. I want you please to call the police at once. The police? My niece may be lost, kidnapped, anything. Calm down. Calm down, Mrs. Ferris. We will look for her. The best thing for you to do is go upstairs... and get some rest. Rest? I can't rest! I've walked up and down that beach... until I thought I'd go mad. Just a minute. (Speaking Greek) There. You see? We will search for her... all of us. Along the shore, in the hills. I am quite sure... that we will find her before long. Thank you. I will go get my coat. I'm going back along the beach... to look for her. If she's found... please send someone after me. Stratos. I want to know where that girl is... and I want to know now. How should I know where she is? I'm not her nurse. I warn you, Stratos. I will stand no more from you. No more threats, no more lies. After tomorrow night... you'll never see me again. If you have harmed that girl or Mr. Camford... I won't rest until you have paid for it. We've been poor people, simple people... but we have been decent. I want my son to grow up decent. How long would your decency have kept you if I hadn't sent you money from England... all these years? Enough to buy this house... enough to start this inn. Better to have nothing... better to starve and have some self-respect. It was my money, not your self-respect... that kept you and your brat... and the whole family 15 years. You send us money you worked for honestly? What do you know about me? What I've worked for, planned for, fought for? Nothing. Tell me where she is, Stratos. In God's name, tell me. Get out of my way, Sophia. Either you tell me, or I'll go to the priest. I'll tell the whole village. I'll tell them that my brother Stratos... is a criminal. No, you won't, Sophia. You won't say a word. You knowwhy? You love your son. You wouldn't want anything to happen to him, would you? Even you... would not do that. Oh, yes, Sophia. Even I would do just that. Now get out of the way. (Dramatic music playing) Door locked! Never been locked before. All right, all right! That looks like the only way in. That looks like the only way in. MARK: What are you doing? It's game we play. Be careful! I do many times. I best on Aghios Georgios. Alexis! (Speaking Greek) I get too old to play this lousy game. Alexis! Alexis! Is she all right? Nikky all right! How'd you get in here? Quickly. Please, quickly... before that horrible man gets back. What man? Stratos... he's coming back. Hurry! Don't worry. We get you free. Break, will you? (Speaking Greek) There. Oh. Uhh. Oh. Oh, Alexis. No time make love. You get out. Quick. Not to steps. This way. Quick! Steady! I can't look down. I can't! I can't do it! Listen to me. You not fall if you don't be stupid girl. Watch me. I show you how. You OK? V ery good show. Come on. She too much afraid. I don't know. Don't look down! Watch the sails! Jump when the next one reaches you! Aah! I watch for Uncle Stratos. Stay there. I'm coming up. Unh. No! Mark, stay there! I'll jump! (Creaking) Slide now! Aah! Aah! Aah! That's it. Come on, you're all right. Go! No time make love! Now Uncle Stratos coming! No! Take her other hand, Alexis. No. I go back to village. You must come with us. If your uncle finds out... He won't find me. I hide so good... even devil don't find me. Go! We'll be in Aghios Nikolaos. (Dramatic music playing) (Unlocks door) Oh, come on. Oh! Just let me rest a minute. Not here! Just let me get my breath. You're right out in the open. Aunt Fran will be looking for me. She'll be hysterical. You'll be safe in Aghios Nikolaos... and that's where you're going. Don't you tell me where I'm going! I've been through enough today because of you. I want my aunt, and I want the police... and I want that monster Stratos arrested! This is no time to start making a scene. You're coming with me. Oh! Oh, Mark, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. All right, you've had your say. Nowwill you come with me? I'm sorry. Honestly, I didn't... It's all right. It's all right. I know, I know... but we can't stay here. All right? Mm-hmm. Now come on. Mark, at least you could tell me why... Stratos tried to kill you. Why is he trying to kill me? I'll tell you later. You keep saying you'll tell me later. I've been shut up in that horrible windmill... almost murdered... and now we're running away. Well, I don't knowwhere or why or what's happening or anything. If you waste any more time jabbering... you won't live long enough to find out. Oh, I'm going back! Listen! Don't you understand? Stratos is a desperate man. He's got everything at stake. Now, you've stumbled into this mess... and I'm doing my best to get you out of it. Well, l... I don't see why... I should go running all over Crete with you. I don't even know who you are! I'm a master criminal wanted all over Europe. V ery funny. I will tell you in Aghios Nikolaos. One thing I do know... your manners are as bad as Stratos'. V ery well, Miss Ferris. Stay here. Call a policeman. I'm sure he'll offer you better protection than I can. (Dramatic music playing) Turn around! Mark, wait! (Crack) I think I've killed him. No, he's all... he's all right. He's, uh, he's all right. He's just out cold. But I heard his head crack. Yeah. Good one, Nikky. Oh, Mark. Ooh. Aah. Your shoulder... it's bleeding again. Nikky. Do you... do you think you can possibly go on alone? No! Don't be silly! We must stay together. I honestly don't... I honestly don't think I can make it. Yes, of course you can. Come on. We must go. OK. I'll take that. Unh. We'll find somewhere along the way... and then you can rest, all right? OK. (Dramatic music playing) What is this place? The temple of Apollo. The locals say it's haunted. Well, we can rest here. Over there. Yeah. Mark, it is creepy. That's all the better. We can hide and rest. (Cats yowl) (Gasps) It's all right. It's only cats. That's the most bloodcurdling sound. Cats are bad luck on Crete. (Yowling, hissing) Wonder who she is. The young lady that ran back to Stratos... and lost her head. Mark? Mmm. I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you. No, no, no. I think in view of all the trouble you've caused... it's about time I told you the whole story. No, not now. Tell me tomorrow. I want to tell you now. Um... well, it's... have you ever heard of the Countess of Fleet? Yes. Wasn't she the woman... who lost those fabulous jewels in a robbery? Some man who worked in the bank... was accused... he was accused... Yes, that was me. Mark, did you steal... No, of course I didn't. Who did? Stratos, I think. How... how on earth did you get mixed up in that? Oh, it's all so... the Countess kept all her jewels at the bank... where I occupied... what is known as a position of trust. Sometimes, she'd ask me to bring them to her... when she wanted to wear them. Well, on this particular occasion... instead of waiting for the guard... you know, the security man... Mm-hmm. I took the jewels from the safe... and jumped into a taxi... and took them straight around to Fleet House. What happened? Well, one moment... I was standing on the doorstep with the jewels... the next moment, I came to without the jewels... and a lump the size of a golf ball... on the back of my head. Stratos? I never got a chance to see his face. I was hit from behind. Oh, I see. How awful. Oh, how awful. But why didn't you take the guard with you? I was in a rush that night. Why? Oh, it's... oh, the most idiotic of all reasons. I had a date. Oh. But... but how did Stratos know you were coming? Well, that's what everybody wanted to know... the police, the bank, the papers... even my doting family. I think one of the Fleet servants tipped him off. But I suppose they thought you did. I was dismissed, disbarred, and generally disgraced. Oh, Mark, how dreadful for you... and how unfair. Oh, yes. Well... (Dramatic music playing) We'd better find somewhere with some more cover. But how on earth did you trace Stratos here? Well, a fence was arrested in London. Just a routine affair. The police found one of the Fleet earrings... among his loot. Now, this man lived over a Greek restaurant... in Soho called the Moon-Spinners. The Moon-Spinners? Now, wait a minute. By hanging around, I discovered that the owner... had lately sold off and vanished. He was a Cretan, a man called Stratos. That was a pretty long shot, wasn't it? Well, it paid off. I found Aghios Georgios... another inn called the Moon-Spinners... and another Cretan called Stratos. But you don't even know if he's got the jewels, do you? Well, I'm pretty certain after last night... aren't you? He might've left them in London. Not a chance. At the inn? Warm. The church. Warmer. I know! The Bay of Dolphins! That's why he was so determined... you weren't to go there! It's got to be. It's the only place. You mean he's buried them in the sea? Well, he's always out there scouting around in his boat. Mark, if you're sure, why don't you... - Call the police? - Yes! Because I have no proof, no proof of anything! No way of connecting him with the robbery at all... except that he tried to kill me last night. And I suppose he locked you up in the windmill... because he thought I might've told you... the whole story. Was she pretty? Hmm? Who? The girl you had a date with. The girl... The girl that night. Oh, her. I don't remember. That blow on the head... must've knocked her clean out of my mind. You believe me, don't you? About the girl? No. About me. I'll tell you in Aghios Nikolaos. Now, try to sleep. I'll get the gun. (Dramatic music playing) Here, you can use my shoulder if you like. I think it's a bit more comfortable... than the ruins of ancient Crete. (Chuckles) Better? Mmm. It's the most comfortable shoulder... I've ever slept on. (Cats yowl) (Clatters) (Thud) (Yowling, hissing) (Yowling, hissing) (Yowling and hissing echoing) It's all right. (Yowling and hissing) Well, well, well. What have we here? Hansel and Gretel? Who are you? N-now, don't wave that firearm at me... young lady. I'm the British Consul at Heraklion. Good morning. May I ask... what you're doing out here? You're hikers, I suppose. (Chuckles) No. Well, not exactly. Yes, but why the rifle? Are you in trouble? Yes, we are. There's this terrible man... this criminal. Actually... actually, there was, um... a wedding at the village, and, uh... uh, some of the locals got a bit drunk... and, uh, started a fight. But, Mark... Things began to look dangerous... so we thought we'd better clear out. V ery wise, but what are you going to do? I mean to say you're miles from anywhere. Mmm. I wanted to get Miss Ferris to Aghios Nikolaos. Well, why don't I drive you? I've got my summer villa there. Oh, that would be wonderful. Mark, that's lucky. My name's Anthony Charles Scott Gamble. It's always a pleasure... to help her majesty's subjects in distress. How do you do? Look... why don't you go along with Mr. Gamble... and I'll see if I can... get in touch with your aunt? I'm not going with anyone... and you've got to get a doctor... - to see to your shoulder. - Shh. He was shot in the shoulder. Shot? My goodness. Yes, you have been having adventures. Well, it so happens... my wife's a qualified nurse. She'll be happy to attend to you. Oh, that's marvelous! Please, Mark. Otherwise, I won't go. All right. Mr. Gamble? Hmm? What are you doing out here... so early in the morning? Well, I'm an amateur archaeologist. I often come out here to putter among the ruins. I have a nose for making singular discoveries. What? Why don't you tell him about Stratos? No! But he's the Consul. Not yet. Don't you think we might dispense with the rifle? Guns before breakfast are so uncivilized... don't you think? (Light music playing) Come on in and make yourselves at home. My wife should be around somewhere. Whew. Hot out there. Cynthia! Cynthia... oh. My dear, I came across two compatriots... down at the ruins. Miss Ferris and, uh, mister... Camford. Mr. Camford. How do you do? They ran into some trouble with the natives. Mr. Camford's hurt his shoulder. Oh, my dear, how dreadful. You both look worn out. I hope we can take care of them... until their affairs are set in order. Yes, of course. I'd be delighted. If I could look at your shoulder... perhaps I can be of help. - Oh... - Oh, well... It's all right. You need have no fear... at handing yourself over to cynthia. She was known as the Angel of Eastbourne... during the war. Oh, Tony, don't be absurd. Would you like to go along up? Thank you very much. I'll send the car... to Aghios Georgios for your aunt. I'll see you later. Why are you still here? I told you to go home. Where did you find them? Peacefully sleeping at the ruins. A fine mess you've made of things. If you'd had your way... this entire enterprise would have ended... with bodies strewn all over the island... like the last act of King Lear. Was it my fault... he turned up at Aghios Georgios? I did everything I could to get rid of him. As for that girl and her aunt... Did you seriously imagine... you could dispose of two british subjects... as though they were sacks of potatoes... without anybody starting an inquiry? You've endangered us all by your senseless bungling. Now that you've got them here... what are you going to do with them? I shall take care of them with efficiency and dispatch... two qualities which you seem to be sadly lacking. You listen to me, you chattering old maid. I want to know what you're going to do. It's not your concern anymore. Go back to your village and concentrate on carrying out... your part of the bargain tonight. If it hadn't been for your grotesque addiction... to astrology... I could have handled the whole deal from here... without involving anyone else. My chart has not lied. From the beginning, it has not lied. You sit here reading your letters... making contacts... collecting your fat commissions. I did the whole thing... from the beginning, I alone. It was your chart, I suppose... that produced Madame Habib. Well, you just remember this... if either of those two get away... it means the finish of you... and your whole cozy setup. You'll be sorry you did not stay at home... and stick to your knitting. I don't knit. It so happens I do extremely fine petit point. (Speaking Greek) Not that way. Through the garden. Savage. (Knock on door) (Mouth full) Mmm. Come in. Hello. Are you feeling better? (Mouth full) Mmm. Are you enjoying your breakfast? I never thought raspberry jam could taste so good. (Chuckles) Well, I brought you something fresh to put on... until your aunt arrives with your things. NIKKY: Oh, thank you. My dear, I wanted to talk to you. I'm worried about Mr. Camford. Oh, why? What happened? Well, I've given him penicillin... but he really needs professional care. How bad is he? I don't want to alarm you, my dear... but I think his arm may become infected. I don't know if I caught it in time. Oh, no. How awful. We must get him to a hospital. Well, there is a wonderful British hospital... in Athens. Athens? But could we get him there in time? I mean, if his arm's really bad, it might... Now, don't let's anticipate disaster. Why don't I talk to Anthony? He's so wise... and he has such influence with the local authorities. Well, if you think so. But l... Oh, you poor dear. You have had the most dreadful time. But don't worry. Anthony will take charge. Anthony always takes charge. You can trust him completely. Now, you're not to worry about a thing. Everything will be all right. Can I go and see Mark now, then? Oh, I wouldn't if I were you. He's sleeping. Oh. Are you, by any chance, related to Lady Ferris... of Pentwithwith Castle? Not that I know of. Such a dear person. Her daughter married a second cousin of mine. Reginald Busby-Pelham. Really? Yes. I'm so frightfully out of touch... with everyone here. There isn't even an English club. Tch. Ohh. (Door closes) Reginald Busby-Pelham? (Giggles) Of Pentwithwithwith... with. Oh, crikey. Ah, there you are, my dear. How's Mr. Camford? I just looked in. He's still sleeping. Oh, dear. Poor chap. Oh, what a beautiful yacht. Yes, isn't it? Um, shall we go in? Yeah. Lunch ought to be ready by now. Now, this way. I'm sure it was a wise decision to go to Athens. I've arranged for a plane to pick you up at Heraklia. Mr. Camford should be safe in the British hospital... in not more than three hours. Oh, that is a relief. I'll wire them to reserve a room. There we are. Unfortunately, you've chosen... the worst day of the whole year... to leave here. Tonight is the feast of King Minos... our local carnival... and the whole place goes mad. So the sooner you leave for the airport... the better. How can I ever thank you and your wife enough? Well, it was a stroke of luck... that Cynthia was able to look Mr. Camford over. You can always trust Cynthia completely. Hello, my dear. We just sat down. (Slurring) I'm sorry to be late. I was finishing a letter to Maud Devises. Do you know Maud Devises? No, I'm afraid I don't. She's the daughter of the Earl of Leigh. We're old, old friends. Ohh. Would you... would you care for some bread? It's so close. There's thunder in the air. Well, take a pill, dear, and go to bed. I wish I could go to Athens. Anything to get away from here. The Acropolis is really quite pretty by moonlight. I'm afraid my wife fails to respond... to the glories of classic art. I'm tired of classic art. All those broken columns... and statues without arms and legs. Oh, Greece isn't so bad. Think of Blackpool in November. (Chuckles) One can't make friends with people here. Even those shipping magnates... who are they? For all their yachts and their villas... nouveau riche. Take Madame Habib. Imagine a woman like that being received. Cynthia. A scrubwoman's daughter from Alexandria. That's what she was. Married five or six times. Cynthia, I hardly think... Sailing around the world in that enormous yacht... entertaining royalty. Who's Madame Habib? C YNTHIA: Why, she's the woman that... (Clears throat) Eat your curried eggs, dear. I'm tired of curried eggs. Maud Devises wouldn't have allowed her... inside the house. Neither would Lady Ferris... or Millicent Coatesworth. Maud Devises is a galloping old bore. Don't speak of my friends like that. My friends mean everything to me. That's what comes of living in an outpost. It ruins your manners. (Sighs) I think I should go up to my room. I did ask you, didn't I? You don't come from Pentwithwith? No, I don't. Oh. I should like some sherry sent up to my room. (Clears throat) I think I shall lie down. Take her up a cup of cocoa, would you, please? (Whispering) Mark. Mark. Mm. Oh, hello. (Whispering) How are you feeling? (Grunts) Peculiar. Must be the color of these pajamas. How are you? All right. How's your shoulder? Does it still hurt? No, not much. Lady Cynthia gave me a couple of shots. Well, I hope she knows what she's doing. She tipples. I thought as much. Oh, and there was a scene at lunch. What about? Oh, how awful everyone is in Greece. Simply too unrefined... especially some woman who has a yacht... called Madame Habib. Too ghastly. Who? Madame Habib. Too ghastly. Married five or six times. Nobody who is anybody... would even have her inside the house. Madame Habib? Mm. Her yacht's in harbor. The Minotaur? Are you sure? Mark, lie down. Is she here? Oh, I don't know. I asked... Madame Habib? That would explain everything. What would? Why he was so desperate to get rid of us. Why he's been hiding in Aghios Georgios. What he's been waiting for. Stratos? The deal. The big deal. I must get out of this house. You're not going anywhere. Now, Mark, just lie still. I've got to go back to the village. You're doing no such thing. You're coming with us to Athens... because Mr. Gamble has already ordered the plane. Well, he can unorder it. I can't let Stratos slip through my fingers now. Mark, please, be sensible. Help me, Nikky. I've got to get dressed. Just tell me why this woman... is suddenly so important to you. She's a multi-millionairess... of doubtful repute... with one of the finest collections of jewels... in the world. So what? She'd be the perfect customer, don't you see? Stratos can't sell the Fleet emeralds... on the open Market. They're too well known. I don't knowwhat the Angel of Eastbourne gave me. I feel half-crocked. Now, look... if you lie down... and promise not to move... I'll go and see if that yacht... really is the Minotaur... because there's a telescope on the terrace. All right? I'll be right back. And don't move. (Dramatic music playing) Oh... If you're interested in the sights, Miss Ferris... you ought to look at the Fort. Now, where are we? There it is. It's a famous V enetian Fort. NIKKY: Hmm. The heads of malefactors were stuck on spikes... over the gate... and left there to blister in the sun. Oh, how awful. (Both chuckle) Well, um, if you'll excuse me... I'm just going to... Yes, of course. Nikky! Auntie! Ohh! Ohh! Oh, auntie! I don't think I've ever been so furious... with anyone in my whole life. Oh, hello. I've given the driver full instructions. You've been wonderful. I don't know how to ever thank you. It's my job. As your passport has it... "To afford Her Majesty's subjects... "every help and protection." Oh! Do be careful. Oh, he's unconscious. Do you think we'll get there in time? Poor boy. Everything will be all right. Just try to keep calm. NIKKY: It's a hearsse! How very bizarre. I don't think that's very funny. Well, it wasn't intended to be, my dear. It so happens it's the only available vehicle... in which anybody can stretch out flat. As long as it gets us to the airport... that's all that matters. Yes, well, I think I'm going to get in the back with Mark. Thank you so much, Mr. Gamble. Good-bye. Good-bye. Have a good journey. Thank you. Now, you will do all you possibly can... to see that that horror Stratos is arrested? Yes, of course. Absolutely. We'll be happy to testify. Well, uh... I sincerely hope that won't be necessary. Good-bye. Good-bye. (Speaking Greek) And happy landings in Athens. (Fireworks whistling) (Marching band playing) (Driver shouting in Greek) (Crowd whooping) Shh! Please, quiet! Shh! We must get off this street. (Speaking Greek) Go down there. Oh! (Shouting and fireworks) It's all right. Just lie still. Mark! I don't knowwhat Lady Cynthia was up to... but I'm convinced she's drugged me to the gills. What? I found some tablets in Gamble's bathroom. I feel quite astonishingly wide awake. What... you're insane! Mr. Gamble's the British Consul. I don't know what the devil he is. There's something fishy about them both. Now, you get on that plane and go to Athens. Do you hear me? If you try to get out of this hearse... I'll do something desperate. I've got to get back to the inn. I've the strongest possible hunch... that tonight's the night. Stratos will kill you. And if he doesn't, I will. Now, lie down! Don't you get rough with me. I'm an invalid. Mark, you're not going without me. You'll only get into some awful scrape... and I won't be there to help you. Dear Nikky... you've gone through quite enough for me. I just don't want you to get hurt. Take care. Mark! (Fireworks) Will you explain to them? We have a sick man who must go to hospital! (Speaking Greek) (Honking horn) Hoo hoo ha ha ho! (Marching band playing) Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark... Mark! Mark, stop! (Dramatic music playing) NIKKY: stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop the boat, will you? I want to get on! Stop! Stop it! Will you stop? I want to get on! It's very important! (Speaking Greek) (Knock on door) MADAME HABIB: Come. (Leopard growling) Madame, there's a young woman... in a motorboat alongside. She's signaling to come aboard. What sort of a young woman? CAPTAIN: A young woman. I don't recall any mention of a young woman... in the arrangements. Bring her on board, and we'll see. Yes, madame. Thank you. (Leopard growling) What are you doing... out in the middle of nowhere following my yacht? Are you Madame Habib? Yes, I am. And who, may I ask, are you? I'm Nikky Ferris. Please, I must talk to you. It's terribly important. What do you have to say to me? I never heard of you in my life. You're dripping all over my carpet. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't think because you have managed to get on board... that I'm going to give you money. Oh, I don't want any money. Really, I don't. What do you want? Hurry. You are holding up my ship. Are you going to Aghios Georgios... to buy those emeralds? What did you say? The emeralds that were stolen... from Lady what's-her-name in London. She kept them at the bank. And Mark was asked to take them to her... and he was held up. And he never saw the man's face. It was a terrible scandal... and Mark had lost his job and was disgraced... and he was in... ah-ah-choo! Thank you. Now please explain, what emeralds? Please, may I sit down? Sit. Aunt Frances and I were on a holiday... and we went to Aghios Georgios... to record some songs for the BBC. And Mark was there. There was a wedding... and the next day I found him in the crypt. He'd been attacked by Stratos. Stratos? He's the man with the emeralds. - So I helped him. - Who? Mark. I had to. But then Stratos found out... shut me in the windmill. He was gonna kill me... I think, but Mark and Alexis got me out. Who is Alexis? He's a boy from the village. He's got a donkey. Oh, I see. What happened then? Well, then... we ran away... and spent the night in these ruins. Oh, there were so many cats. And then Mark told me who he is. Who is he? He's the man who was held up. Not the man whose face he didn't see. Whose face did you see? Mark's. But he's in... in... ah-choo! I think I need a drink. Oh, I know it all must sound... absolutely crazy to you... but I'm so afraid that Stratos will kill him. And now Mark's gone back to try and stop him. Please help me. Please, Madame Habib. Stratos will stop at nothing. And Mark is sick and weak... because he was shot in the... Ah-ah-choo! Who else knows about these emeralds? Uh, my... my Aunt Frances. Well, I had to tell her. And where is she? Well, she's in a hearse at the airport. Drink. What is it? It may clear your brain. Oh, my brain's perfectly clear. It's just I'm so cold. That will warm you. Tell me, do you often... have adventures of this kind? (Sighs) Never. This is the first one I've ever had in my life. Something tells me... it is not likely to be the last. So, your aunt knows... and she is in a hearse at the airport. Dead or alive? Oh, alive. At least, I hope so. Anyone else? Um, well, Sophia knows. And Lambis, I suppose. And I wanted to tell Mr. Consul... the British Gamble... Mr. Gamble, the British Consul. Mr. Gamble, the Consul? Yes. Do you know him? When I knew Mr. Gamble, he was not the Consul. He was a dealer in antiquities. And you knowwhat you are? You are an imposter! Me? You are the girl... from that English children's book... who walked through the glass... into a world full of crazy people. And do you knowwho I am? I am the March Hare. (Knock on door) Madame, may we get underway? At once. So, what is it precisely you want me to do? Don't buy the emeralds. Please! Give them to Mark... and then he'll take them back to the bank... and then he'll get his job back... and everyone will know that he's in... innocent. Hmm. I have known many strange people... in my life... but you are the most incredible. (Dramatic music playing) (Engine starts) Uhh! (Dramatic music playing) (Speaking Greek) For crying loud out. Hey, my Uncle Stratos kill Mr. Camford. What? (Speaking Greek) We go now to the Bay of Dolphins. Quick! Where's Nikky? Don't know. No time now. Alexis, wait. She's with him. She's with Mr. Camford. Come, then. Boats go now. Quick! (Shouting in Greek) You are lucky I don't throw you overboard... for the sharks! Ohh. What was it you gave me to drink? I feel all sort of far off and lofty. You know, sort of rather lofty-softy. (Knock on door) Come! We've dropped anchor, Madame... off the Bay of Dolphins. Is there anyone? CAPTAIN: He's coming aboard. Come here. No, wait a minute. Maybe you'll like this one better. "It was the schooner Hesperus "that sailed the wintry sea... uh..."and the skipper would take this little daughter..." In there! And don't make a sound! Above all, don't sneeze. But what are you going to do to me? I have not decided. You know something? You're rather a dear little thing. I mean it! (Knock on door) MADAME HABIB: Come. (Growling) Be quiet, Charlemagne. Come here. Are you the man from Mr. Gamble? I am. Have you brought his jewels? Yes. Well? Show them to me. STRATOS: You have the money? I must see the jewels firsst. (Gasps) Oh! These are the emeralds... Orlov brought to Catherine the Great... from the Crimea. Part of the Turkish ransom. MADAME HABIB: What magnificence. Quick, I want the money now. Wait. No. I want the money now. I want to get off this ship. MADAME HABIB: Will you come with me? It's in my stateroom safe. No. I want the money here... now. You don't even realize what you're holding, do you? A thousand years of passion, pride, and blood... crystallized into those perfect stones. V ery well. (Leopard growls) (Loud hiccup) (Dramatic music playing) (Speaking Greek) (Gasps) You! Aah! What are you doing here? (Speaking Greek) Let me go! (Leopard growls) (Growling) Let him go! Let him go! Nikky, keep away! Stop! Stop this fight! You'll smash everything. Oh! Captain. Captain! Stop them! Captain! Oh, Captain! Captain! Stop them! Mark. Stop. Stop! Unh! (Growls) Stratos! There. There is your man. Not the young one, you fool! The other one. You're under arrest. The police are insisting that we turn back to Heraklion. You must do as they say, of course. But, Madame... You should know by now I always cooperate... with the police. Nobody is to leave this ship. They cannot have lied. The stars cannot lie. Everybody lies when it serves their purpose... even the stars. (Officer speaking Greek) I lived through two wars, four revolutions... and five marriages... but nothing... nothing like this. I thought I told you to go back to Athens. Yeah. (Hiccups) Of all the pig-headed, persistent pests... AUNTFRANCES: Nikky! Nikky, you dreadful girl! - Are you all right? - Yes. Don't you ever, ever, ever... Madame Habib, this is my Aunt Frances. Well, since this seems to have... turned into a family reunion... we might as well make the best of it. I will have dinner served on the rear deck. I'm so upset... I shall have mine in bed. Madame... I'm sorry to inconvenience you... but don't you think the Countess of Fleet... would like her pendant? You and I have not even been introduced. You didn't think I was going to keep it, did you? The Countess happens to be one of my oldest... and dearest friends. Thank you. MADAME HABIB: Charlemagne! Nikky! Nikky! Will someone please... Oh, Alexis! Will someone please tell me what's happening? (Dramatic music playing) Good-bye, Alexis! Thanks for everything! You come back to Aghios Georgios. We make good hotel now. We'll come back soon, Alexis. Good-bye. Good-bye. We'll be back. You come back. We have nice big wedding, maybe. Maybe. Ha ha ha. - Good-bye. - Good-bye, Alexis. - Be careful. - Bye-bye. Good-bye, Alexis. - Good-bye. - Bye. (Dramatic music playing)
