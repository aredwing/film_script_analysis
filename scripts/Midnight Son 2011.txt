Your body's telling me you're malnourished but you say you're eating like a horse. One of you is lying. I knew this was a bad idea. You may be developing some type of anemia. I won't know until I run some tests. Anemia What are the symptoms of anemia? Feeling better? Yes, a little bit. You just fell right over. Thanks again for helping me. How old are you? Twenty-four. They say that human body stops growing at age 25. Yes. You're in the last stages of something. Like a... caterpillar... turning into a butterfly. I don't think so. Want a blowpop? What? A blowpop.

Smokes? - Yeah. - Reds, spirits, slims or malts. Reds. Good choice. Do you smoke? And he called me a twant. Then he wrecked my car and now the fucker owes me money and he's trying to say we're square because I made him sleep on the couch for a week. - You guys live together? - Not any more. I kicked him out after he started to use my place to sell meth. - How much does he owe you? - $400. Maybe you should just let it go? You won't have to deal with it any more. Maybe you're right. You shouldn't let anyone talk to you like that. So what do you do beside sell candy and cigarettes? I... I bartend. Catering, shit like that. What do you do? - Security. - Day shift? Nights. Sounds lonely. I'm used to it. You like working nights? Yeah... yeah. Sure about that? I don't really have a choice. Why not?

It's like you're a vampire. Vampire. Who is this? Hello? Jacob. From the other night. Yeah, sorry, I didn't recognize the number. I'm glad you called. - You are? - I am. What are you doing?

I never saw it. So stupid. No, it's real. Yeah, right. It is. It's called green flash. It happens sometimes right before the last part of the sun disappears. Caused by the same refraction effects that make the red sunset. Really? Yes, it's rare, but it happens... You just haven't seen it yet. You ever see it? No. Can I use your bathroom? - Yes... it's just around the... - I'll be right back. Sorry the place is such a mess. Fuck... What just happened? I... got a nose bleed. No, I mean... I'm sorry.

It's just... just medicine. What's wrong with your eyes. I don't know. - Take those off. - No! Let me see, okay? Open! You look okay now. I do? Has this ever happened before? No. You want me to take you to a doctor, or something? Maybe you should leave. It might be contagious. - Fuck that. Let me take care of you. - Look. I just wanna be alone right now. - Wait.

Take any breaks, walk around the grounds, leave the premises for any... I take my breaks in the kitchen in the back there. That's a nice jacket. I remember when I was at work you had to wear a uniform. Jesus, was that thing uncomfortable. Do you ever take that off when you're on duty? No, why do you ask? Just... following up a lead. One of our eye witnesses said they saw a guy... with a dark coat running around with some kind of logo on it. So you're sure there's nothing you could think of? No, I wish I could help, but I didn't see anything. Listen, if you remember anything... just give me a call. Yeah, I will. Thanks. - Hello. - Hi, it's Mary.

It's an emergency. - OK? - Okay. Let me see if he's here... Thank you. I appreciate it. What the fuck are you doing, huh? I'm sorry. I need... Shut the fuck up you piece of shit. You want to ruin everything? Huh? Meet me at Southward Avenue in two hours. Fucking asshole. And don't come back! Russell, southside alley. Yeah, man. Not the front, the alley. Yeah, now. What the fuck, man! Dude, this built like through the drive-through? Huh? So what now? Fuck! - Can't do nothing for you 'til next week. - No. You got to see yourself, kid. After that little show there for nurse Ratshit,... I've got to be in my best behaviour for at least a week. I'll pay double. Take it. There's got to be something you can do. We tried that shit, remember? You didn't appreciate my creativity. Shit! You know, you are one fucked up mother fucker, man. - Yeah, Fuck you! - What? What did you say to me, bitch? Fuck you say? Call my brother. Here. I'm sick. I have some kind of disease. What is it? I don't know. I think it's... Talk to me. It's anemia. Anemia? That's a... that's a blood thing, right? Yeah, it's a blood thing. So that's what the medicine was for? Is it serious? Yeah. Why didn't you want to tell me? It's just too much. I'm such a freak. Hey... I'm strong than you think. Promise me you'll see a doctor, okay? - Okay. - I mean it. I will. I don't want to go in there. Seriously? Fuck it then. We'll have our own party. Get up. Get up! Move. Move! No, no, you stay. You move. Where's my brother? I don't know. - Did you kill him? - You know this guy? Shut up! - Please let her go. - Answer my question! No! You want to help her, huh? You start talking. Just go. Leave! Shit! How did...? Let me get this straight. This guy shot your girlfriend at point blank range... but she's okay. You think you killed his brother, but don't know where his body is. The only thing you're absolutely sure about, is that you killed her. Yes. Look... You're a nice kid. You got no record... No bad raps, nothing. It's like... - It's like you don't even exist. - I did it. Okay. - What did you do to her? - You guys have the body, right? - Yeah... We have the body. How did you kill her? Okay, the truth is, I don't remember exactly. - So, how do you know you did it? - I can't explain it, but I know it was me. - Wait, you're not going to arrest me? - No. No, I'm not. But I am going to check on your girlfriend. If you want to help her, you'll arrest me. There's no evidence and you can't remember what you did. Most people who confess to a crime can't tell the... cops anything about it because they didn't do it. Come back when you remember what happened. Stop! She was burned? - Go home. - After sunrise? What are you doing? Promise me you won't leave this room. What? You have to stay in here. Why? I may have infected you. I don't believe you. Hey! - You have to stay in here! - Don't yell at me. - I'm sorry. - What's wrong with you? Just... Just promise me you're going to stay in here. Where are you going? Did you kill that kid's brother? He's dry, man. I ain't so pretty no more, am I? I have you to thank for that. Old fart. Didn't last very long. You hungry? You know, I was really pissed off at you, man. There's nothing worse than waking up in the... middle of nowhere with half of your face on fire. But I got over it. Once I had my first taste, I got over it real fast. Want some? You got to drop the morals, kid. You ain't gonna survive with that baggage. You're already damned anyway. Pull over, Russell. Look at them all. Think they're happy? Most of them are probably staring at the tail lights in front of them wondering what the hell it's all about. Why are they even here. I saw it every day in that hospital. A part of me wanted to help, but... nothing did it for me. Now there is. It's going to be my fault. What are you going to do, huh? You going to stop me? You know too many of my secrets, boy. Now, you go and change your tune. Or we going to have a problem. Okay, okay. That's what I'm talking about. Look, man... I don't want to fight you. We all alone in this world. Me and you. It's stupid for us to fight. Look... um... Why don't you help me might as well dump this mother fucker. Maybe we can talk a little bit more about how we can work together. Huh? What do you say, Jacob. Okay, boys. Get to work. - Marcus, I don't want to do this. - Shut up, Russell! Come on, man, it's just too much. You got to stop. Come here. Give me the burner. Give me the fucking gun! Don't you fucking move! What the fuck did I tell you nigger? Everything's different now. I ain't never going to stop. You understand? Wait there. Help him! Come on, man, we ain't got all night. - Your brother's crazy. - Shut up. This is what you'll be doing the rest of your life. Is that what you want? Take a walk. What did you say to him? Fuck it! Let's go. Hey! Stupid mother fucker. You leaving me here? It'll be over soon. You mother fucker! Come on. Wake up! I'm so hungry. Jesus Christ! What did you do to her? Stand up. Let me see your hands! I'm arresting you. That's what you want, isn't it? Stand up, you piece of shit! Tell everyone. Everybody got their thing, man.
