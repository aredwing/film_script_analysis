Good evening, sir. This way please... Have a sit, here. Toast! How do you like it? Wasn't she the most prettiest girl? Yes, she was. 'Cause that's my daughter... What do you want to eat Hee Young? I want everything. Everything? SIREN Hee Young! No! Back off! Honey! Command Headquarter, this is Yang Chun Station we successfully entered the southern part of the second floor. Get out of the way. What's the matter? What is that? No! Stand back! Stand back! Please stand back. Yangchun, Yangchun! Hurry withdrawal, over. We go into after we refill the oxgen, over. Hello! Hey! Yangchun, Yangchun! Hurry withdrawal, over. Hello! Are you okay? Yang Chun fire-station. Found a victim! We withdraw over! Hey! Joon Woo! Didn't you hear the orders? Follow the orders! Lim Joon Woo! Are you okay? Chief! Joon Woo! Are you okay? Hee Young, it's daddy here. Stand back. Hee Young, Hee Young. It's dangerous. Are you out of your mind? Back off, you bastard! Lim Joon Woo! Are you a rescuer or what? Why you stop him, you son of a bitch! Hands off! Shut up! Let me go! Let me go! Fuck the hands off! You fucking cray crap! Let me go!!! Yang Chun! What are you doing there? You guys out of your minds! Move it! Hurry up! Lim Joon Woo! Kang Hyun! You guys just got here! And make troubles already? You think this place is a fighting place or something! You two, write explanations and hand in it right away! I'm sorry. Good day has come again? If you keep bothering what I'm doing, I won't stay still! Wan Shik! Didn't you say you quit smoking? Can't you bear it even for three days? Sure, I won't smoke! I won't! Thanks God! I'm alive and sitting here like this. That's why you are always in same position. Ask anyone who would climb Annapurna at my age 27. I'm good enough. Do you want to stop climbing after Annapurna? Would you stop discouraging me? Hey! Are you guys coming over to the store? I'm sorry! I think I better go home. We should get ready for the long journey! Suddenly I happen to move my working place. Why now... Remember Annapurna is not the same as Mt. Everest. Got to run, bye. Good bye. See you later. Hey, Choi Jung II I heard you and Lim Joon Woo went same fire-school. Is he always hysterical like that? Well... he wasn't a trouble maker. What? Such a man dared to get fight in front of us? Damn rude bastards! Damn it! Cut it out. It's not officer Kang's only fault. However Joon Woo has quite a temper, too. He's tough. He looks just like me when I was young. Yeah, sure. If they have another fight in front of the accident scene, I will kill them both! Would you cut it out now? What did I do? Didn't you see? They are acting so rude! I worked seven years as fire-fighter but I haven't seen fighting... What are you trying to do? Oh, You are gonna write explanation reports in computer? Have you ever written any explanation reports? It's not that hard to write it. If you were me, would you just let him jump into the fire? Well done, after all. He saved a life, anyway. Who is it? What are you doing? Don't push me. You are just too slow and bothering my way. Hello. Is this a rescue party's office? Is there a person named Lim Joon Woo? How do you do? My family owe him our lives. He saved my husband. Hello, how do you do? Here, have some drink. Come on, take one. He saved my husband and it's the same as he saved my whole family. This area is the most vulnerable area. About seven accidents happen every month in this area. Be careful boys. Well, anyway this place will be rebuilt sooner or later. Shall we take some rest? Sure. I quit smoking. Really? They say if one quits smoking he must be vicious, so to avoid. I quit it during preparing for climbing Everest. I see. What? You mean that... So you are the one who won the prize for 119 magazine? Yes. When did you have time for climbing? So are you gonna keep climbing mountains? Yes. I'm going to Himalaya soon. This time Annapurna is my goal. Really? Annapurna. Kick the ball! Pass, pass! Block up! Block up! Way to go! Block it, Yea Rin. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. Can't you wait for a little longer? My wife is looking for everywhere to... I'm gonna pay it back! If you take half of my salary how can I live? Do you need company? Oh, hello. Sit down. Sure. Damn! I can't get off this nasty disgusting smell. What is this smell? Can't you see I'm eating here? Well... How can I lie about the smell? I looked around everywhere and did everything to find that asshole! Remember the last accident of the China Castle restaurant. You misunderstood me... I know I look strange but you know the truth is... I only see the victims of accidents. You have that much to talk about with him? Just ignore him! Why should it happen at every meal time, huh? Happens every meal time! But I believe you ate a lot! No way! I only had two spoons! Let's hurry up and get back before the soup gets cold. Yang Chun station, how's the situation? Over! Let's move it! Hurry up! Hold on to it! One, two, three... Hold tight! Stop! Stop it! What is it? Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Stop it! It's just like a real fucking hell! Joon Woo! Jeong Hoon! Don't move. Are you okay? Hey, Mr! Wow, he's brave. Be careful. You son of a bitch! Jeong Hoon could have been killed because of you. Damn it! Let me go. I never asked for his help, sir! What? Damn! I really don't want to work with him! Father! This is my way that the heaven gave to me. Now and then, you haven't changed a bit. You thought this is some kinda medal or something! Wanted be a hero or something? You were always like that! Everything you do is right, huh? It was only a couple of minutes. And all you've got was only this? Did you say only? To them every second is like a hell. What a hero you are! Why don't you mind your own climbing business? Everyone thought she's dead! But I saved her by artificial breathing! And so we got married. Then you guys met at the accident scene? That's right! He will be a father soon. But you are married for only six month. You know... they went too fast! Back then each was like that. Chief, aren't we gonna go to see Jeong Hoon to the hospital? We will as soon as we finish our work. Okay. Did someone get hurt? We had an accident yesterday. He will definitely have a scar because of someone. Probably the burn will scar over for his whole life. Cut it out. Joon Woo, be treated at the hospital. This is not a mere scar. Someone drowned again. So how can I just stand there? I jumped into the water and saver her. And she happens to be a beauty. So I tried artificial breathing... I better go now. I hope I didn't bother you guys. See you some other time. Yea Rin, what you made for us was so delicious. I'll really glad if you make for us again. Chief! Don't forget to water them every once in two days. Okay. Thanks. They are really nice people. You know what? Mr. Park will be a father soon. I told you not to come! I didn't come here to see you anyway. Wow, this... You're tired, aren't you? How do I look? Pretty good? You wore the backwards. Is this the front? Shall I take fire-fighter examination? Oh, come on. Well... I sometimes think about breaking up with you... and think about how much you'll think about me... how much you'll miss me... so whether you would be sad. You should meet someone just like you! Then you will know, how I feel. Yea Rin was a pretty fine lady. And also glamour! You don't think so? It's late, you better go now. "It's late, you better go now"? If you are so worry about me you can take me home! Lim Joon Woo, don't regret later but be nice to me, now! Slow down, you might get stomach upset. I told you to come to me when you are hungry. I was hiding. If I get caught my mother will be fired. Don't be so envious of other kids but get married and have your own child. A baby of yours will be very pretty. You are here again. I'm sorry everytime. It's okay. Don't worry. You work at the Yang Chun fire-station, right? I barely recognized you're not wearing the uniform. I met you yesterday at your working place, remember? Yes, I know. I also came to see Jeong Hoon. I see. May I ask you something? Is he really hurt because of Joon Woo? Give my little daughter's life back! Make her alive, you bastard! Bastard! I said I would take care of it. You always say you will take care of everything but what did you do? And is fire-fighter some kinda a government post? Stop it! I hope you don't forget you have a family to take care of. You guys didn't have to come. Don't get up! Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Your wife is still hot-tempered! Jeong Hoon! Look at you! Look what Joon Woo that bastard did to you! No wonder your wife is hot-tempered! Well, she's little rough, anyway. I mean how she and your kids can live If you die or something. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine now. We should have to give this to your wife but you take this, it's not much. No, It's okay. Jeong Hoon! Take it! You don't even have any indemnity. And give some more to me if I get hurt. Watch your mouth. I was just joking. Don't worry about the station and get some good rest, okay? Yes, I will get better soon. I'm here, sir. Oh! Come on in. Thank you for yesterday. Come on in Yea Rin. Hello. How are you? I'm fine. Oh, she's Joon Woo's girlfriend. Oh, welcome. And where is Joon Woo? Why would you look for that guy? If he has conscience he can't be here! Watch your mouth! What? You told him not to come here! From when did he follow my order? He's damn rude! He definitely has a cold heart! How could you say such a thing about him! Ha, ha, ha! I thought you'd be here. You know what? I got my pays yesterday. Shall we go to some nice places? Do you want to go to the some movies? What's on nowadays? I'm starve to death! Let's go and get something to eat! What's the matter? Please don't do the useless things! Always say don't do this and don't do that! Don't say 'don't'! Don't hurry. Lower your body. Lower it. Now, don't hurry. Can you hear me? Can you? Calm down, calm down. What's the matter with you guys? Can't I die at my disposal? Sure. Then why don't you just jump? Don't be so imprudent, Joon Woo! Why? You changed your mind? Stop it! Stop fooling around with his mind! Persuading is better choice! Don't do that. He's more likely to do that. What the shit are you talking about? Get out of my way, you bastards. I believe there's a reason for this. Whatever the shit is, I don't care if I die. Nothing will be changed even if you die. What do you know about me? I lost everything what I've got in just a single day! What about your kids? Fuck! My death will rather help them. I can't help leaving them lots of debt only! For a kid, nothing is more important than being with a father. But I get more miserable if I try to live this world. Don't! No! Joon woo! No! Today there was an accident in Kurodong Kurogu... The man was requesting the arrears of pays and improvement of labor conditions but was fell and got killed. Yusung industry is the company which producing automobile parts. However, because of the continuous depression the empolyee couldn't get the pays for several months and also large number of employees got lost their job. So there have been continuous demonstrations. When the accident happened Yang Chun station hurry got there but... Do you think that was the proper attitude that you should do? What you've said was rather stimulate the upset victims than to calm down. I thought I should delay him from what he was trying to do. But even Kang Hyun was trying to stop you. A suicide had a beer bottle and a knife in his pocket. You should had considered that! What I did was the best at the situation. The best? Did you say the best? Have you forgot what you did last accident? Do you think you are qualified as a rescuer? That's enough Mr. Lim. You can go now. Mr. Kang! I don't think Mr. Lim did proper judgement. What would you do, if you were he? Joon Woo's judgement was the best solution. I would had been the same as Joon Woo. Let those two work inside duty until there's a special order. Tae Young! What are you doing! Cut the rope! Cut it. You want us all to die here? What are you doing? Cut the rope! I'm sorry! No! I'm sorry! No! Joon Woo's late today. He will be late today. Yes, I know. I've seen the news. His picture on the news looks exactly the same as his father at his age. Are you hungry, grandpa? I'll make the dinner for you! You all right, huh? One of the reasons they ordered you to work inside is because your body. But I know you won't follow it... I have no problem at working. Do you know when I hate this job? When I leave for a work in the morning. My wife can't say "See you later at home"! Hey! Do you have some kinda problem? What's the matter with your face? I work in the same office with Joon Woo. Really? Since when? A little while ago. You two guys have very think affinity. Wan Shik, If you were me back then, could you have been cut that rope? I thought you would ask me one day! I mean I hope you to ask me that. I would! How serious conversation was going on? You don't even notice I'm coming. We're talking... How was the result? He said let's see how it turns out. Now I'm not what I was. Well, what about your belief which, you can be on your knee on the top of the mountain, but not in front of the mountain. Wan Shik! While feeling blue let's listen to the music. That music again? Aren't you sick of that music by now? Want something to drink? Sure, I'll have coke Okay. What's the matter with you? You are smoking again. Nothing. I have no problem. You know well why I have to go to Annapurna, don't you? Hyun, I really need you. If you climb, I'm climbing too. You can trust me! Hey you, Jung II. Bring the hose here. I report to you sir! My name is Han Min Wook who is assigned to Yang Chun station. What? Jong Hoon resign few days ago and we already have new member? Aren't you starting next week? What brought you here this early? Yes! I came here early to get ready for the work. I'll be a nice family sir! I'll do that. Okay. Put it there. Mr. Kang carry this! Give it to me. I'll do that. Hey you freshman! Can't you do that right? Where is my little princess... Here you are! I'm surprised! What are you gonna wish, my princess? I wish to marry Dad. What about you mom, then? Well, you can have both me and mom. Light candles, Dad. Happy birthday, dear my Hee Young... Here! Chief have one more! Hey! Han Min Wook! You are trying to be our family for free? I will do whatever you want, sir! So is this the freshman ceremony? He ate it all. Here goes my ceremony! I, as a fire-fighter who is full of pride and a spirit of sacrifice, will now sing a song! May I take a order? Go! See? I told you I was gonna on my knees only on the top of the Annapurna. Congratulations Tae Young! Hey! Why is it so noisy there? Where are you? Come over here soon! Oh. I'm here in Hitebeer. Station family is having dinner together! You! You! Stop singing and sit down. Wherever you are, don't ever say you sing well next time. Much better than me in singing. Excuse me, but... The man over there asked me to bring this to the man who's sitting at the end. Who do you mean? He was right there a minute ago. Anyway we can take it and drink it, right chief? I love this moment! I love to drink, chief! Jung Joo, may I have some words with you? Well, our job is to help others... So they take it for granted, but... who cares if we can't earn much. Who cares whether the president or Choi Jin Sil knows about it or not? My kids know their father is the best and we have family here all around me. Yeah. We don't need more. I just love this. Here, let's drink! Yes Chief! Here have some drink, Yea Rin! Sure! Thank you! Let's have a toast. Toast! Mr. Kim, you know I care about you, right? Let's toast. I'm getting hot. Thank you. Here you are. It's already over? We should drink one more bottle! I'm sorry... we're all drunk. Hey! Lim Joon Woo, have some more drink! Okay? Goodbye! Mr. Kang! Today is the only day I'm letting my boyfriend to you okay? Don't drink a lot! Okay! Have some fun, I better go now. Get back home safe. Okay. May I have one? I thought you quit it. I did. I think Yea Rin is really a nice lady. Don't make her cry. It's none of your business. Joon Woo! Would you please know you life is valuable? I don't die. Don't die! If you die you just turn out to be one of the victims. Have you ever thought about your Grandfather and your girlfriend? How would they feel? Let's end now. Tae Young wants to see you. Joon Woo! You are always like this. You are too selfish enough that everything you do is so right and the best. Do you know how many people would get hurt beacuse of your... Damn! How much do you know about me? Do you know what is in my heart? Damn it! You... What's up with you? You came to see me. Joon Woo! This is how to express love. See! It really easy to make me happy! How poor they are! What is all that about? Young fireman's death... How his wife can live with a little baby... The one who is alive is the poorest. Joon Woo, shall we go to the singing room? For Annapurna! Annapurna! Great! See what I have told you? I told I wouldn't be on my knees on the ground unless I'm on the top of the mountain. Wan Shik, bring all the alcohols at the store! We'll gonna have it all. Bring the most expensive ones. What's the matter with your face in the middle of the dining? How much have you drunk? We are going to the Annapurna. So got the fist mark for the a souvenir? Then you should have drunk with me!
