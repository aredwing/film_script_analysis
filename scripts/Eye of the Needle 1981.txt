The dead are being dug from the rubble and in France, the German armies wait for this country to surrender. But English troops are fighting back. In the skies, the young men of the RAF are struggling against the Nazi forces which only a year ago invaded Poland, swept through France, and left this country standing alone in a conflict which, if lost, could destroy the Free World. Sergeant Major, move the men in. All right, you lot, move. Mind your backs. Gangway. I found the four extra carriages you need. - Good. - You'll have your thousand men. - I'd rather be with them than here. - Finland appeals to you, does it? - Is it the country or the ladies? - Just a brief surge of patriotism. - Are you coming for a drink? - Thanks, no. Perhaps tomorrow. Hello? - See you in the morning. - Yes. Three that I can see from here. Cheers. - Mr Faber? - Hello, Billy. I've got another interview with the army. You don't look any older than you did last week. My mate Harry's got some cream that'll take the pimples off just like that. There's no need to rush. There'll be plenty of war left, I can promise you. But I want to fight now. Everyone's in uniform except me. Unless they've got a special job like you. - What about the navy, Billy? - I've been thinking about the navy, but... - Well, I can't swim a stroke. - Then the air force is out. - Why? - Well, you haven't got wings, have you? - Take these over, love. - Thank you. - All the best, love. - Thank you. - All the very best. - Thank you. Thanks very much. Mrs Rose? David, darling. I think I'd better go and get changed. - Can I help? - No, you can't. Well, my boy, when do you join your squadron? Tomorrow, sir. A Spitfire. I saw her yesterday. Lovely kite. There we are. Mama, I'm so happy. Oh, darling. - He is a lovely boy. - Isn't he. Darling... Off you go, Emma. Both of you. - Lucy... - Yes? Lucy, I... I don't know what you're expecting tonight, but I... I... I think you should know that... Mama, I do know. Goodbye, Mother. Goodbye, Daddy. Bye. Billy, you missed your tea. And you, Faber. Have something at the pub. - Thanks. I'll just have a wash. - See you there. - Freddy, can I come? - I don't know about that. - You in the army yet? - Tell him about that miracle cream. Oh, yeah. Will you tell Mrs Garden I'll be late? My mate Harry's got this cream that takes all the pimples off... Mr Faber, I've kept a nice piece of meat pie warm for you. - We mustn't let that go to waste. - Not with this rationing, we mustn't. I'll be down in a minute. 24 hours isn't very long for a honeymoon, is it? We can start right now. There's a bottle of bubbly down there. So there is. - There we are. Are there glasses? - But of course. Everything's supplied. - Oh, dear. - What? Well, I was just thinking of Mother. This afternoon, she tried to tell me what happens on a wedding night. She's a bit late. What did you say? I said she was a bit late, didn't I? Henry? Mr Faber? What are you doing? It's all right. It's... just for the station. Classified work regarding the trains. I shouldn't really be telling you. - Please, listen to me. - No. Trust me. - You're a spy. - Stop struggling. Listen to me, please. Last night, the Luftwaffe's main target was again London. Considerable damage was done to residential and industrial areas... David, be careful. You're not in your Spitfire yet. Dearly beloved brethren, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. He gives us the sheep and we... give him back the bones. Lucy, I think I've offended your mother again. I'm right here, David. You may address me directly. - A tantalising invitation. - David, please... Drink up, darling. - You'll be packed and ready, won't you? - You needn't worry. I'm ready now. Good. Daddy. Mother, I apologise for David. He finds it difficult to be with people now. - You understand? - Of course, darling. - My poor girl. - No. I'm all right. We're all all right. Aren't we, Tom? Aye, indeed we are. Well, goodbye, Mistress. These are for you and your husband. There's little enough to eat in London at the moment. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Tom. Come on, Tom. He's drunk. - Is he always like that? - Most of the time, but he's a good friend. Any time you want to come home, you and Jo... No. My home is here, Mother, with David and Jo. It was you who told me not to expect marriage to be uninterrupted pleasure. - I'm afraid it was. - Yes, it was. Well, at least Jo seems well. - I kissed him on the ear. - Perhaps if you had another? Why ever not? Surely David's capable? Yes. But he can't bear to pass me in the hallway for fear of touching me. - Come on, Lucy. - I do love you. It's not necessary to tell Father about this. - No. - No. Come on, then. - Bye-bye, Grandma. - Come along, Jo. Agent Muller. - Someone's in with Muller. - Good. Give them 60 seconds and then go in. You've left a trail a blind man could follow. We're surrounded. Speak in English. The Fhrer wants you to... reassess the strength of Patton's army in East Anglia. It's invasion strength. They have the photographs. General Patton is ready to invade Europe at any time at Pas-de-Calais. - Hitler's astrologer... - Astrologer? My God. He believes... attack will be at Normandy. All right. I will reassess. - I will signal in the usual way. - No. Absolutely no further radio contact. You have to take photographs. Deliver them personally to the Fhrer. - Personally? Why? - He says he trusts you. - He wants to hear from your own mouth. - Well, I'm flattered. Admiral Canaris is sending a U-boat to pick you up off the coast of Scotland. That's nice. Have you been carrying this around? Yes. Why? - Let's go. - We'll get them both. What's this? Storm Island. Two miles from the rendezvous. - The U-boat will pick me up when? - When you signal it. From six in the evening until six in the morning. Six in the evening till six in the morning. Beginning when? A week from today, and for a week after that. And you. How will you get out of England? I'm supposed to get to Liverpool somehow. If they capture you and torture you? - I have a suicide pill. - Would you use it? Of course. If necessary. Jo asked me to say good night to Daddy for him. He loves you very much. I love him. But, darling, you don't show it. You never tell him. You never hold him. Don't be afraid now that he's growing up. Afraid of what? What the hell have I got to be afraid of? I'm going to go for walks with him, aren't I? And swim with him and play football with him. - David... - I want him to be proud of me, don't I? To grow up like his father, a legless fucking joke. I suppose you and your mother had a lovely time discussing me. She's very concerned about you. I don't need anyone's concern. I can manage alone. I can't. David, I need you. - I love you. - Don't. Please, don't. I want to sleep. For God's sake, let me sleep. Thank you. You haven't let this room to anybody since the death of Mrs Garden? No, sir. Not since Billy Parkin lived here. He's in the army now. I think I've seen everything I want to see. Thank you very much. Sergeant. Billy Parkin? That's right, sir. Hello, sir. What's this all about? Murder. I'll never forget coming back from the pub. And there she was. Dead. - That was the worst shock of my life. - I'm sure. Bloody Henry Faber. My hero, he was. Bastard. Even wounded in the war. Medals on his chest. Anyway, what do you want me for? These are photographs of German military graduation classes. Same year, different schools. Take your time. - I am looking for Faber, aren't I? - Yes. That's him. That's him. That's Faber to the life. And look. Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of German intelligence. And right behind him, his young student - the Needle. - Going fishing? - And a little bird-watching as well. If you're lucky. Best keep to the far side of the canal. Restricted area this side. - Really? - Starts half a mile from here. The man, codename: The Needle. Also known as Henry Faber. He was born on May 26, 1900, at a village called ln in West Prussia. At the age of 13 he went to the Karlsruhe cadet school in Baden. Two years later, he was transferred to the more prestigious Gro-Lichterfelde near Berlin. He already spoke fluent English because his father, Baron von Mller-Guder, had worked in Washington as a military attach, and had sent his son to private school there. But back in Germany, the boy rebelled constantly and was often flogged for it. He passed his final exams with extremely high marks. In the '20s, the Needle was a cadet at the war school in Metz, and Wilhelm Canaris befriended him. In '31, Hitler visited the family estate and met him. In '33, Hitler came to power. The Needle was made a captain and sent to Berlin for unspecified duties. He had an affair with a German actress. He never married. He made no close friends. And in '38, the Needle disappeared. God. Clever bastards. - Good evening. - Good evening. - And who might you be? - I should be asking who you are. You're on my boat. - What's in that bag? - Binoculars, camera, reference books. No, you don't. Put your hands up. Would you mind? Thank you. How nice to hear from you. Of course. Yes, that shouldn't be too difficult, sir. You would prefer it in the morning? By all means. Yes. Good night. I want that in the diplomatic pouch to Lisbon this afternoon. - And on to Berlin? - As soon as possible. Fine. May I ask you... It's insurance. You don't come to us very often. - Not very. - You keep to yourself. A cautious man. A cautious life. But then, how else could one survive these days? One could stop. But not you. Training. - Patriotism. Good. - Here, please. Pull in here, cabby. Thank you. Do you know what these are, Godliman? American aircraft. These are photographs of Patton's Allied invasion force in East Anglia. The Germans think there are only two possible places for an Allied invasion of Europe. And they're right. From East Anglia here to the Pas-de-Calais, or from the south coast of England to the beaches of Normandy. Operation Overlord has decided on Normandy. Then what is General Patton's army doing in East Anglia? There is no army. These planes are made out of plywood. We did it to fool the Germans. The man who took those photographs knows it. Consequently, he must also know that we intend to invade Normandy. Find him, Godliman. It could cost us the bloody war. Well, sir, if you were at this station and wanted to get out of the country, you could go to Holyhead or Liverpool or Glasgow and then catch a ferry to Ireland. He wouldn't risk Holyhead because of the passport control. How about Liverpool to Belfast? A car across Ireland and a U-boat on the coast. You're talking about our 11.45 Marylebone to Inverness. Stopping at Stafford, Crewe, Liverpool... Liverpool. That's where he'll get off. You're right. - The 11.45 left on time. - How do we get on it? - You could stop the train... - Yes. Get us a plane. - Yes, sir. - Come on, Billy. - Fancy a game of poker, mate? - Why not? We're stopping again. - The driver probably ran out of coal. - Probably forgot his ration book. Now remember, Billy, you've just to point him out to me. Don't you worry, sir. I could recognise Faber in a stocking mask. Blackout. Pull your blinds down. Thank you. Blackout. Pull your blinds down. Blackout. Come on, give us a bit of room, pal. Someone take him away. Come on. Blimey. Excuse me. Excuse me. Be still or I'll kill you. Why are you looking for me? - I'm not. - Don't lie. Has the army changed its uniforms, Billy? What's the plan? Where's the trap? Glasgow. They're waiting for you at Glasgow. So they finally let you in the army, did they, Billy? Congratulations. Oh, my God! Thank you. You've been terribly kind. You won't change your mind and have a spot of lunch? - No, I must get on to Banff. - As you like. I hope your car's there when you get back to it. It won't get far without petrol. The Red Army has scored huge successes against the Germans, striking back with tanks and troops along the Eastern Front. Hitler's armies have suffered many humiliating defeats and have fled, frozen and in disarray, through the killing snows of Russia. All this at the very moment Hitler was saying that the word "surrender" is not to be found in the German vocabulary. The US and British Forces have stepped up their daylight bombing of Germany. Mr Churchill and General Eisenhower are in conference and with the approach of summer, an attack by the Allies on Europe is, of course, only a matter of time. The fatal question for the Nazi command must be where and when will the invasion take place? A U-boat will pick you up off the coast of Scotland, but only when you signal it. From six in the evening until six in the morning. Deliver the photographs personally to the Fhrer. He says he trusts you. How very flattering. Aye, that's the feller. I picked him up in the middle of nowhere. - What a fool I felt when I saw this. - Are you positive it was the same man? I offered him lunch. - And he was going to Banff? - I dropped him right opposite. - Scotland Yard on the line. - At last. Scotland Yard. I know it's late. It's late here, too. David. Put your arm round me. That's it. We've had ten more sightings of your man. All checked? We've interviewed eight. We're on to the other two. We've searched from Cape Wrath to Carlisle. He hasn't got a roof over his head. You're on Storm Island. - Storm Island? - Now you know how it got its name. You were swept into the bay. Everything always is. Please, don't get up. - I've frightened your little girl. - He's a boy. - I'm sorry. - No. I must cut his hair. Was anyone else on board with you? David, we really must put the poor man to bed. No, I was alone. Didn't you bother to get a weather report before you left? No. - Did you notify the coastguard? - David, what does it matter? Because if he did, there may be men out there risking their lives looking for him. - And we can let them know that he's safe. - No. I... I... I did not notify the coastguard. I'll just turn the bed down. - I've never seen anybody so exhausted. - But, Mummy... Jo, you must play terribly quietly so that the man upstairs can sleep. He won't hear anything. - Mummy, why... - David, who do you suppose he is? A damn fool to be out in this weather. He's not a working sailor. - He's not a working sailor? - No. I noticed his hands are terribly soft. His hands? He's wearing a suit for God's sake. You're very observant all of a sudden, aren't you? I'm going over to Tom's. David. Suppose he wakes up? Who's that man in my room, Mummy? I don't know, darling. ...a girl with long blonde hair with diamonds in it. - Do you know what diamonds are? - Sort of treasures, aren't they? I must cut your hair soon. If you didn't, would it grow and grow and grow? Yes. It would grow down to your ears. Then it would go down to your chin. Then it would grow down past here. Then it would curl up here. Then it would start tickling your feet, and we'd all have to get out of the bath. Why? Because if people don't get out of their baths, they melt. But I haven't. Mummy... Mummy, can I have my room back? Of course you can. Come on, darling. Get out of the bath. Do try not to cross-question him. I'm not cross-questioning. It's perfectly normal to wonder who he is. I just think it would be nice if you didn't go on at him. I'm only trying to find out what happened. Come in. Good evening. Hello. How are you feeling? Better, thank you. I'm Henry Baker. Hello. I'm Lucy. Lucy Rose. - How do you do? - This is my husband David. - How do you do? - How do you do? Have some hot soup. Thank you. - Bread? - Yes, thank you. Can you tell me the time, please? It's ten to nine. Ten to nine? - Help yourself to cider. - No, thank you. Thank you. I'm... very hungry. - This is Storm Island? - That's right. - And what do you do here? - Sheep farmer. - Really? - I'm going to bed. My back's playing up. You're a fool. Lucky to be alive. Why were you out in the storm in the first place? Because I had no idea it was going to be so severe. Give me two. I want to sleep. I can do that. Good night. - Would you like some more soup? - No, thank you. It was delicious. There's some brandy next door. Would you like some? Do sit down. Where do you live, Mr Baker? I used to live on that boat. I suppose I am a damn fool. I moved from London about a month ago. - Really? I haven't been there for years. - When were you last there? Four years ago. And that was to have a baby. - You've been here four years? - Yes. My goodness. I hope you have friends here. Well, there's Tom who takes care of the lighthouse and the ferry comes every other Monday with our supplies. - That's all? - Yes. - Cheers. - Cheers. What do you do if there's an emergency? There's a radio transmitter at Tom's cottage, but that's really more to do with the lighthouse. It seems a terribly lonely place to live. Well, you see, David and I had a motor accident on the day we were married. That's how he lost his legs. He was training to be a fighter pilot. And then after the accident he... Well, we both wanted to run away, so we came here. It seemed like a good idea. It might have been a mistake. You can't blame him for wanting to run away. No, I don't. It's terribly sad. No, it was our fault completely. We'd had a bit to drink and we were driving much too fast... - Suddenly there was this lorry... - No, I meant it was terribly sad because you're so unhappy now. Is it that obvious? I do love him, you know. The way he used to be. The times when he's suddenly like the old David and he and Jo and I go and have a picnic on the cliff or something like that. He spends most of his time now with Tom. I think they just sit and drink. The first year that we were here my parents came to visit. I can't tell you. He was silent and he hid from them and... I feel sad for Jo, really. He keeps asking about his granny and where she is. - He's a nice little boy. - Isn't he. And he's so clever. And he's very brave. - And lucky. - Why do you think? To be so loved. No. I'm his mother. - All parents love their children. - No. No, not all. Some parents... Some parents use their children. Set goals for them, goals they weren't able to attain in their lives. Hardly love, do you think? No, hardly. I wonder why you go on if it's not working. I suppose if I were perfectly frank, I'd admit that I couldn't bear the idea that all the years of trying were wasted. I really don't think... I could bear that. Oh, dear. Four years on this island and I've become such a bore. Tell me, Mr Baker, are you married? - No. - What, through choice or bad luck? - You think it's good luck to be married? - Well, yes, normally. - Sometimes I imagine myself married... - To another man. - You've hurt yourself. - I'm awfully sorry. You're very beautiful. Please, don't. We tied up Friday afternoon, nice and early, to keep out of that bloody storm. It's Sunday. Why did you not let us know she was gone? - I haven't been down here since. - McKillop, could that boat have survived the storm? Not a chance. Why do you think I left her here? If he were on it where could he be now? - At the bottom of the sea, the fool. - Good riddance to bad rubbish. - He'd be drowned. - I'll believe that when I see the body. Morning. - I've saved some coffee. Black or white? - No, thank you. - I'll make you some breakfast. - No. I'll wait for lunch. It's lamb stew for lunch. David says it won't be long until we all turn into sheep. - Where is he? - He's just gone out with Jo to check on the flock. Good morning, Lucy. - Good morning. - You don't despise me, do you? No. How could I? Well, you could. I could. It can't happen again. It won't. Do you regret it? Let's go out. You'll be gone soon. Now the storm's over. Not in that, I won't. I don't even know what you do. I'm a writer. A writer? Are you really? Good Lord. What do you write about? The war. Not battles and killing, but isolation. The feeling some men have of being suddenly separated from every other man. But I thought war was meant to bring people closer together. Not me. And you? - Is there a woman in your book? - I shall put you in it. - No, really. Is there? - Yes. One woman. What does she do? She lives, has an affair with our hero, - then she dies. - In the Blitz? No, he kills her. She broke his heart. I'd better get back, then. Come on. I hope Lucy didn't keep you up too late last night. No. I'm going over to Tom's, see if he's repaired the transmitter aerial. - Would you like to come along? - If I can help, yes. I'll get my jacket. - I'll be in the truck. - Can I come too, Daddy? No, you stay with Mummy. You've been out today already. We'll walk over later, darling. Go and say goodbye. Daddy, why can't I come? I think he knows. - How could he? - I don't know. I just feel it. You feel guilty. Don't. My wife tells me you're a writer. - Successful? - Just beginning. - Why aren't you in the Forces? - I was. I was wounded. So was I. - Are you married? - No. Wise man. What I'd do with that freedom. I should think you're fortunate to have Lucy. - Would you? - Yes, I would. I used to fly Spitfires. Beautiful kites. Four guns on each wing - American Brownings. Fired 1,260 rounds a minute. Really? - Aren't you interested in aircraft? - No. I should have thought you'd be an enthusiast. Why? It's become a national pastime, hasn't it? Aircraft spotting. Tom. Do you mind going inside, seeing if he's there? If he's not, we'll scout around. He won't be far. Tom. Tom. Is he in there? He's sleeping. Or rather, he's drunk himself unconscious. You lied to me, didn't you? - What are you talking about? - You said you're not interested in aircraft. - I'm not. - But you are. You're very interested. - Give me the film. - What film? The can of film I found in your pocket this morning. Yes, that's the one. - On your knees. - This is ridiculous. - If this is because of Lucy... - Those are photos of our aircraft. I work for the RAF. I was delivering film... Save it for Lucy. She'll be here soon. She's fascinated by everything you've got to say, isn't she? Now bring me the film. On your knees. Give me the film. Give me the film. Hello. Hello, Jo. Where's David? Drunk. Let's go back home, then, darling. Daddy's busy. Shall we? - Was it all right? Did he say anything? - Nothing. I'll go and collect him after supper. Come on, then. Jo's asleep. He said to say good night to you. What are you thinking? Do you realise what time it is? I must go. I must go and... fetch your husband. You feel guilty. Don't. Godliman? - Godliman, here. - I've had Churchill on the line breathing fire. - Listen, man... - Godliman, don't interrupt. It's been decided. The build-up of troops is complete. He must not get back to Germany. Catch him or kill him. Understood. Mummy? What the hell are you doing? Jo, we can make a drawing of all the things that the storm did. We could draw Mr Baker's boat against the rock, couldn't we? We could draw the clouds. All the black clouds that came out. Look, Jo, you can see the cliffs perfectly clearly. Can you see them? Aren't they pretty? Jo, stay here. Don't move. Don't go near the cliff. My God. My God, David. Help! Help! Somebody! Help! Somebody! What was in the water, Mummy? Jo, darling, Mummy has to go out now. You can... be a good boy. Stay here and play with your toys, will you? Henry. - Where are you going, Mummy? - I'm going over to Tom's, darling. Your husband refuses to come back. He and Tom have been drinking and... Lucy? There you are. Have you been out? Yes, we were out walking. Would you like some coffee? We saw something in the water. - We looked at the wreck of your boat. - Quite a mess, isn't it, Jo? - Would you like some coffee? - No, thank you. - Have you just seen David? - Just now, yes. Somehow they'd managed to fix the aerial. Lucy? Here are the keys. Where are you going? I thought I'd better get David. He really mustn't drink so much. Leave him. He told me to fetch him at teatime. Leave him till then. Let's have a picnic. Shall we make sandwiches, Jo? Once, we went for a picnic at the bay. - You'd enjoy that, wouldn't you? - Yes, I'd like that very much. I do love you. "I am going to the House of Death," said the Swallow. "Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?" And he kissed the Happy Prince and fell down dead at his feet. A curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. "What a strange thing." Said the overseer at the foundry. "This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace." So they threw it on the dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying. "Bring me the two most precious things in the city," said God. The Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird. "You have rightly chosen," said God, "for in my garden of Paradise, this little bird shall sing for evermore." "And in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me." Come on, have your milk, darling. I tell you what, if you're a good boy and drink up all your milk, you can sleep in front of the fire tonight. Would you like that? Yes. What islands haven't reported? Sanda Bister, Uist and Storm. That's not worth worrying about. - Which? - Storm. We can never raise Tom at night. - Can we, sir? - Tom does like a drink after a hard day. How do I get on to these islands? In this weather? I'll go get us something to drink, shall I? I won't be a minute. - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm coming. Come along, darling. Come on. Please. Start. Lucy. Tom! Tom! Tom. Oh, my God. Tom, you must wake up. It's Lucy. Oh, my God. Lucy. I'm trying to send an urgent... Hello? Please, if anyone hears me... Please, I'm sending an urgent message from... Hello? Do you hear me? This is Storm Island sending an urgent SOS. If you hear me, could you let me know? We are looking for any German vessel. It's probably a U-boat. When we return to refuel, the next squadron will already be on its way. - All we need is the weather. - To hell with the weather. - We can't take off in this fog. - I know. - We've just picked up an SOS, sir. - From where? - We don't know yet. - Hello? Are you receiving me? Over. Hello? Are you receiving me? Over. Lucy. Oh, my God. Lucy. No. - Go back upstairs. - Mummy, I'm cold. Run. Lucy? I know you don't have any shells left. And I'm going to open the door. Please, I have to come in. I'm not going to hurt you, Lucy. I promise. But I am coming in. I am coming in. Mummy. I'm sorry if I frightened you. I'm sorry. Everything's all right now. You're all right. We'll lock the door. This is Storm Island. Is there anyone there, please? Hello, Storm Island. Receiving you loud and clear. Over. Hello, Storm Island. We've been trying to raise you all night. Over. Come in, Storm Island. Over. Come in, Storm Island. Let me talk to her. Hello. Can you hear me? You're on to "receive". If you want to talk to me, say "over" and switch to "transmit". I repeat, can you hear me? Over. There was a man shipwrecked on our island. He killed my husband and our shepherd Tom. He's outside of the house now. So... please come, for God's sake. Over. We are on our way to you. Now there's something I want you to do. It's absolutely essential. Are you hearing me clearly? Over. Yes. I understand. Over. You must destroy your radio. Over. But... why? Please don't... No, I can't do that. I've got no one else here to help me. Jo, stay there. - Hope the island isn't fogged in. - Just get there. Jo. Put the gun there. Stand by the door. There's a bottle of whisky in the other room, Lucy. Would you bring it to me, please? Good God. The war has come down to the two of us. Do you know that? I did what I had to do. It cannot be undone. I'm sorry. Goodbye. Mummy... - Mummy. - Yes. Yes, all right, darling. It's all right. It's all right. Now, you must stay here. Stay here, will you? Stay here and wait for Mummy. Oh, God. Stop! Please stop! Stop, please! Stop, please! I had to kill him. I had to... Can you... Can you get up? I did stop the transmission, didn't I? Yes, you did marvellously. Mummy!
