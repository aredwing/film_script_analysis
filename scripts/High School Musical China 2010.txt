Our joy is flying high, and the time is now. I have my own style. I can do what you can. The show's about to begin, I'm the superstar! Grab my microphone, rap my heart out. Karaoke rocks! Never look down on me. Twirling moves, passionate feelings, follow my music and feel the heat! I believe one day, miracles will happen for me. Slash the bondage, rock out my soul. Ball spinning in my hands. Slam dunk! My turf! I'm Kobe and I'm the champ! Who dares to challenge me? Come on, come on. Watch me bring it on! Come on, come on. Let go of your worries. Come on, come on. Try it out with me. Enjoy yourselves, nothing to worry. Roses fight to catch a glimpse of me, follow my style and worship my pride. I'm born to be a star, who's more radiant than I am? Get ready. Dreams are about to take off. World of music, it's my party. Hang loose on the keyboard. Music explodes out of my fingertips. I sing to my youth. I play the coolest music. Tomorrow is a song, I write it on my own. Be brave, there's nothing you can't do! Wings of dreams fly me high! Happy time, I take charge. It's our time. Happy time, give me five. Sweetheart, wake up! Am I late? Hurry up, eat your breakfast. Crayfish 318kg, carp 216kg, ok, ok. Hurry up, Ning Ning. Don't be late on your first day of new school, we'll lose face. Hurry up! You are not going to school, what face do you have to lose? You know what, Ning Ning? We work so hard to get you into this great school. Dad raises these crayfish one by one, and Mom sells them one by one. That's right. We count it for three days, still don't know how many fish we have to sell, to earn enough money for your tuition. But just guess how many fish I can pay you back in the future! Ning Ning, stop joking like that! You are going to study abroad in the future, not selling crayfish! I'm just saying... No more joking. Eat your breakfast. This neighborhood is pretty good, it's a bit expensive but much nicer. You're right, it's very nice. But if it's not for you, we wouldn't spend so much on this place. We want to be closer to your school. Don't stay up too late, don't read in the dark. I've grown up. Just don't miss me too much. You wish! No boyfriends! Oh, dad, I won't! Catch! Thanks. Don't mention it. Poet. Poet. You know how to catch? You know how to pass? You're so dead! Poet, help me! Get out of the way! Is it new? It's limited edition. What do you think? Superduper awesome! Depends on who's carrying it. I'll get you one tomorrow. Cool, thanks! May I have your attention? Can't you see such a cool teacher standing in front of you? Incredibly cool, Mr. Lu! Nice hat. You're our fashion icon! You are all so trendy, I have to keep up with you. You look like Xiao Shenyang! Xiao Shenyang! Ok. Sit down. Karaoke Night Who's going to karaoke tonight? Sign up Morning, Sir. Morning. Are you the new student? Yeah. Ok. Introduce yourself please. Hello everybody. I'm newly transferred from Zhejiang. My name is Xiao Ning Ning. Pleasure to meet you all. Princess, look at her! Find yourself a seat. Okay. New classmate, sit here. Thanks. What's all the noise? Nice going! What did I do? Ok, let's get started. Who can solve this? Running out of battery now? Let me make myself clear. If you can't solve this today, you'r not going to take any activities that are outside the curriculum. You can't do that! Don't underestimate us. We've got talent! Who's that? Poet. Good. What's your answer? I don't know. C'mon. Answer it! Why should I? Y' = 2x y' = 2x Well done! What about this one? Y' = 2x In2 I got it! Y' = 2x In2 No? Let's try a harder one, shall we? Sorry teacher, we haven't studied calculus yet! Right! Ok, listen carefully... 12345 math is not painful. There're formulas for trigonometry. Use your brain, use it daily. When you go shopping, math comes in handy. Just think, answers will come. One step at a time, let's do it together. Interesting numbers, they look familiar. Do as the teacher says, discover what it is. A triangle problem, a love triangle. This kind of relationship, we know how to handle. Don't doubt your answers, believe in yourself! Math to us, does it really work? Addition and subtraction, we use them every day. Multiplication and division, no way we don't know. It's easy, one step at a time. Keep trying, no problem. This is a company's data on return-on-equity, and debt-to-equity. You! Based on this, can you figure out the rate of return on these shares? Ma'am. I am 177 cm tall and weigh 60kg. Based on this, can you figure out my name? Students of finance, pay attention. Long or Short, buy only when the timing is right. Bull or Bear, fluctuations in indices are obvious. Opening and closing prices, must watch them clearly. New stocks, new issues, must fully analyze every market. All sorts of data, asset ratios, the latest info has the greatest value. I know, Long and Short. I know, Profit and Loss. Financial investments require clear minds. With experience, you'll come to see it all. I know, Puts and Options. I know, Up and Down trends. Putting theory into practice. Applying it to reality. No problem! Attention, students! Stretch your body, go outdoors, sitting still slows down the metabolism. The classic virtues are important. A strong body supports a sound mind. Stretch, warm-up and take a jog, that's just a start, don't hesitate. Basketball, baseball, together with martial arts, brains and brawn make you stand out. Numbers and words, never stop. Lacking of oxygen, memory is off. We're drained, still have to study. Everything is blur, we have to cope. I need to move, I need to get loose, to get rid of my stress. Healthy body as fundation, getting good grades will be no problem. I hate math class. It makes me dizzy for days. Me too, me too. Hey, you! You do like to show off! You managed to guess a few answers, and you think you're Goldbach? First of all, I didn't guess. Secondly, I don't want to be Goldbach. Then why were you showing off just now? I just wanted to help out. If you want to know what people lack inside, just look at what they're showing off. If you want to know people's insecurities, just look at what they're hiding. You're a real weirdo. Hey, picking on the new classmate again? Hi! I'm Kobe. "Ko-" as in "Kobe" and "-be" as in "Kobe". Thanks for helping out! It's nothing. Hey, weirdo! If you're so famous, how come I can't find you on Google? Hey, hold it! You can find me, Skinny, on Google. Hi there. I'm a dancer. I know a lot of moves, like this. Hey, hold this karaoke list. Poet, you didn't sign up again? I'm not interested in karaoke. The thing about karaoke is to entertain yourself while torturing others. Are you coming, Ning Ning? No thanks. I've got to do my homework. Wow, you can only do math but can't sing? Your life must be boring. Maybe you're tone-deaf? You two are really not boring. Are you making fun of us? Stop. Be nice to the new classmate. Xiao Ning Ning. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Bingo! You won again! You're back? Have some water, I'll give you a voice lesson in a while. Dad, I've got student activity tonight. In fact, I really want to study with you. But if I don't go, it may affect my relationship with them. Do you agree? Cut the crap. Let me tell you, don't you lie to me again. The other day we agreed I was going to coach you, but you went off to karaoke instead. I wanted to teach you opera movements, but you went off to dance hip-hop. What's your excuse today? It's for real this time. Where's my bow tie? What are you doing? Decking yourself out, walking the red carpet? What are you talking about? Look at yourself, who's the one decking himself out? Dude, you're prepared. Ready to be Karaoke King? Who cares? The songs at KTV are sung to death. I'm not interested. So are the streets that've been walked all over, and you still walk on them. Get out of here. Are you going to sing or not? At least you should show off your voice a little to impress that new girl. Why do I want to do that? Of course you do! You have to proclaim that Poet is THE champion, and defend your temporarily-Iost dignity. Cut it out! She may not even come. What? Are you afraid she won't come? Alright, alright then. Son, you going fishing? Student activity. Student activity? Your hair looks like fishing hook. Mom. Leave me alone! Don't lie to your mother. Take it off! Mom, you don't get it. This is cool! Cool? You look like a gangster! I just don't get it! How come my great Beijing Opera DNA doesn't show up in you at all? Opera DNA doesn't get passed down. Besides, nobody taught me how to do hip-hop either. Huh-huh, uh-uh. What is that? Sounds like a toothache! Hello, Sir. Hello. How come you two are also dressed like that? Kobe, hurry up! Everyone's waiting for you at KTV. Boy, you come over and listen, listen up well. Don't dismiss your old man's tales as old and stale. The amount of salt I've consumed, is more than the rice you've eaten. This is the page you'll never turn over. I know, I know, please continue. Take a walk with the birds every morning, get some fresh air. Take a walk in the evenings helps digestion. Get some exercise for the body. Seriously practice singing in the park. If you don't have what it takes, there's no show! No show! With music from the Jinghu, fans all gather for a big jam! The roast duck of Quanjude is rightly famous. That's right. A bottle of Erguotou and a bowl of noodles make a great meal. A glass of soy milk and a bowl of fried liver lift your spirits in the early morning. Hey where are you going? Don't chase him, let him be. All you do is surfing the Internet, leaving messages on those ridiculous blogs! What your father sings on stage are classics for all times. Want something pop? Sure. I have a good recommendation. What is it? Have you heard Guo Degang's crosstalk? It's worth the money. Dancing and humming to music from earphones like you live in a mental hospital. Every role on stage and every word touches your heart. Mei Lanfang, Ma Lianliang, Shang Xiaoyun. - You never tire of their performance. - Who are they? Haven't heard of them. Perfection in every move. In your generation, it became 'hei, you' Hey. Yo. Hey. Yo. Hey Hey. Yo. Yo. Get out of here. Dad, the best is yet to come! The Classics tell of our Genesis. Let me chronicle tomorrow. Carrier pigeons sound refreshing. But now with emails at one's fingertips it's too late to see the past. But youth is my capital. Song is our language. Dance connects us all. I can imagine my own future. Time creates anticipation. I can see the future of China. Discovering endless excitement. Let bygones be bygones. Bye bye. Let go of worries and enjoy the moment. From now on, it's our era. Follow me to the future and explore, we'll share this world. The best is yet to come. The best is yet to come. Follow me, let's change the future. Happiness is round the clock. The best is yet to come. The best is yet to come. The book of medical herbs is in our hearts. Modern medicine beats disease.

Don't pull me! Let me help you. Say you love me. Say you love me. - Come down. - Don't you love me anymore? Sorry I'm late. Oh, not late at all! Come sit over here. Sit here, there's room. - Take a seat. - Thank you! Have some juice. Your eyes are popping out! Come on, sing! Why, why is love so heavy? Never mind what happened in class today. I'm new, don't know how things work here. What happened in class today? No whispers! I'll pick a song for you. Me? I'd rather not sing. Oh, come on! This is mine. Your hair... It was a nice trick. You! Show us what you've got! Just one song. A round applause for her please! I need your love every day. Can you guess what's in my heart. I love you. I want you to brighten my life. It hangs on my lips every day. What is true love? I love you. Love comes faster than I expect. We are passionate about each other. Is it ordained by heaven? Are we each other's better half? Who can stand to be apart? That date we failed to keep made me cry like a baby. Are we trying too hard? Or too eager to love? Baby, can't help but love, don't know where happiness comes from. Can't help but love, don't know where sorrow comes from. Can't help but love, or I'll lose everything. I don't want to be a failure, I want to live my life to the fullest. Bravo! Is this the first time you guys sing together? You can release it straightaway as a CD! Am I right? Hey, whose side are you on? Get out of my way! Wait for me, Princess. Let's wait and see. Dad, Mom, I'm home! Baby, you hungry? No. How come you're so late? Ning Ning, why are you home so late? I went to karaoke with my classmates. They all applauded after I sang. Karaoke? What were you doing there? What's wrong with karaoke? That's an entertainment venue, not the kind of place for girls. How could you have taken bad influence so soon? What are we going to do? Mom, I'm a big girl now. Besides, all I did was sing songs with my classmates. It's not like I did anything bad. What other bad things would you like to do? You already went to Karaoke! Is there any place you wouldn't dare to go? My poor fate... Ok, stop crying! Ning Ning! We've worked so hard for so long, all for your sake. You're our biggest investment, don't dissapoint us. I know. What do you know? Ning Ning, you must understand, studying is the only way to get ahead. Singing? What good is singing? You have to go abroad for a graduate degree. Understand? Understood. Wow! This is the first cross-college competition! Starcloud Satellite is doing a live broadcast! This singing contest is a chance of a lifetime! Let's form a duo! Let's go! - Winning school can get 100,000 Yuan! - Why? Why don't you take part in it? Hi. You should check out that poster. Oh! You want her to join the contest? Just tell her you like her! Get out of here. Princess Yang Yang is organizing the contest. Who will represent our school? Let us join them up. What if I go give it a try? Only the winners can enter the final round! Shush! Be quiet! Whoever signed up for Princess' Choice Audition, line up here. You're way too amature! Get off the stage now! All of you! One by one! You guys suck! No way you can represent our school! Relax, Princess! What's up? Stop fooling around! The basketball court's that way! I'm not going to practise today. So you want to join the contest? Do I need to? I see. You want to go hear Ning Ning. Auditions have started. Maybe Ning Ning's there. Tell me, I can help you. What're you guys up to? Off to practice now! Go Go Go. My eyes are like brass bells. My body is fit and clean. I'm great at singing and dancing. Can my fans please stay quiet? Oh Skinny, you're so cool! Get me my microphone. Take off my golden armor. My necktie's so green. It's blue! Bring out the appetizers. Oh Skinny, you're so awesome! We'll bring out the dishes. What do you want to eat today? Drinking, eating with sunglasses on. Watch them follow me. Skinny, you're so handsome! We all like you. Hey bro, what're you up to? Hey sis, I'm chill. Want to tell you something, don't know how to say it. Just say it, it's ok. I want you to know. I want to be your girl! I want to kiss you! I want you rock my world! Oh my goodness! You sound so rough. You scared my heart out. Ok, you are in. Thank you. I want you to see me, hear me. I want you to be with me. Stop! Get off! This is a singing contest. What're you doing? Is this a singing contest? Get off! Let go of me. Work hard, or I will add another hour. If you foul again, you'll be dismissed. Hit me, quick, knock me down! Poet fouls! Sorry! Poet, what is going on? You fouled again! My bad. Poet, get off the court! Music I want to chat, chat, chat. Chat with me till you go crazy. Stop, what are you singing? What's wrong? Out Out me? You guys kicking me out? Get him out! Get out. I can't stand these people! I have to go on stage myself. Yuan Yuan, music. Ok. All my music nerves are about to explode! Here comes Princess Yang Yang! No answer, no answer, where's true love? My love, my love, is it you? Think harder, think harder, no answer. Pure love is ideal. Every girl awaits perfect love. Careful or not you will fall in love. Love of my life, is it you? Tarot card answers are very mysterious. We're only a few millimeters apart. My eyelashes are editing your every move. I can feel our heartbeats in sync. What do you think? Pretty good. I think you sing better than she does. And I think you sing better than she does. Then why don't you give it a try? Will you take part in Yang Yang's audition? What about the real competition? That should be good enough for you. Why don't you go then? Do I need to perform in front of people? How about you sing for me? Stop, stop. Stop! What are you doing? Ma'am, we're doing auditions. Audition for what? Ma'am, the first cross-college singing contest is coming up. As the artistic backbone of our school, I have a duty to select the best representative. Right, the best representative! If there were auditions, it'd be the school's decision. Go back to classroom! Nobody moves? Whoever doesn't move will be marked absent! You fouled on purpose, didn't you? I was afraid you wouldn't let me take time off. Time off? Why? To go singing? How many times have I told you, only basketball can build your body and mind. You have to be persistent. I don't care about singing, I just wanted to support Ning Ning. This almost slipped by me, so you're into Ning Ning now? I am warning you, I know her parents, I feel responsible for her, and for you, too. Ms. Lan, you misunderstood. Why are you here? Please don't blame Poet. He just wanted me to join the singing contest. Don't make excuses for him, ok? Ms. Lan, please believe me. Singing won't affect my performance on the court. Really? So you can make both ends meet? I don't believe that you can sing with her, and play basketball well at the same time. Hit it! Hit sideways. Hit the blue one. Why can't I hit it? You haven't played before? No, never. Hit it! My parents never let me come to game arcades. They say it'll affect my study. But you're a grown-up. Even grown-ups have to listen to their parents. If not, there'll be trouble. What kind of trouble? A spanking? Let me play with you! It's ok. I'm going there. Hurry! Poet! Poet! Come play with us! Come on. Let's go. I don't know how... Don't run away! C'mon Poet. Hurry. Ok, ok. I'll wait you outside. Hurry, get in the car. Don't run! We won't bite. What's this? Are you going to thank me? For what? I got you out of a pickle. How should I thank you? Well, I haven't decided. I have an idea... What? You wrote this? Like it? Yeah. Sounds good. Why don't you represent our school in the competition? Why are you here? Why? Right. Ouch! Why am I here? I better get going. Be my guest. We're just having some fun. I see. But why're you hiding from me? Who's hiding? No? Well then let's find a bigger place. I'll show you what a real stage looks like. Let's go! C'mon. - Let's go. - Ok. C'mon! Go, go, Tiger, go! Get moving, get jumping. The court is open for you. The game has begun. Use your skills to compete. Battle on the court. Who wants to be my opponent? Passing the ball with ease. We attack with speed. Break through the defence. Injuries and fouls are nothing. Countdown 'til the very end. This is our show. Victory is ours to take away! The world is your stage. It's for you to take charge. The world is your stage. Wake up. Stand up. Don't let them wait anymore. Get up on stage. Let them worship you. You're a genius! Open up every heart. No emptiness, no failures. Only an absolute high high high. One more time, one more time. Show them what you've got. One more time, one more time. It's no fun unless you give your all! The world is your stage. It's for you to take charge. The world is your stage. Get moving, get jumping. Give a dazzling beat. Get up on stage. Everyone will rock with you. You're the ace in the hole. Capturing every heart. London, Beijing, New York, Shanghai, the whole world is your stage! One more time, one more time. Show them what you've got! One more time, one more time. It's no fun unless you give your all! One more time, one more time. Show them what you've got! One more time, one more time. It's no fun unless you give your all! One more time, one more time. Show them what you've got! One more time, one more time. It's no fun unless you give your all! The world is your stage. It's for you to take charge. The world is your stage. The world is your stage. It's for you to take charge. The world is your stage. Go, go! What's with you? Are you ok? Thank you. What for? Yesterday. The basketball. Oh that. If there's a shadow in front of you don't be afraid. Because behind your back, there's always the sunshine. Ning Ning, I think you should get up on stage. Show off your talent. Let them all know what real music is. I do love music. But I really can't go to the contest. Why not? Because of what my parents said and the look on their faces. I can hardly breathe. Sounds heavy. It's not that bad. Ever since I was a kid, I had to do my very best. Even the tiniest mistake would make my mom gush tears like a broken faucet. Sometimes I feel that I'm not really myself. Me too! I often wonder if I have any singing talent at all. I feel that I want to sing, but can't seem to find my voice. Exactly, can't find the voice, I feel the same way. Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He had a good friend named An An. They always sang songs together. One day, An An invited all her friends to come hear the little boy sing. But at that moment, the little boy couldn't sing a note. Was that little boy you? Do you think the boy was too weak? You hope that I wouldn't be like him, right? That's right. Then you have to promise me one thing. What? You have to sing with me. For me? Thank you. Princess! Princess! Big news! What's the matter with you? Shocking news, exclusive report. Cut the crap. Tell me what is it. Did you know that Ning Ning is joining in the competition too? What? She wants to join the competition? No way! Silly baby, don't fantasize. No sparrows can become phoenix. Have no doubts. Just stay and wait. The princess' glamour will dazzle you. I glisten in the mirror. My smile makes your heart melt. My angel face makes you fall head over heels and lose your direction. Silly honey, think clearly. The ugly duckling's dream never comes true. Don't hesitate. Follow my steps. The princess' world gives you endless excitement. Self-confidence is my trump card. You can only admire and follow my glamour. Lady Luck is with me, keeping failure outside. This is my era. Baby, you're back! Rainbow castle. A real kingdom. It's my reality. It's your fantasy. The pride of a rose. A confident face. Don't hide your admiration. Let it out. Music like Beethoven's. Clever as me. It's my reality. It's your fantasy. The stage lights up. The crowd goes wild. I was born to play the lead. Let me sing out hope. Want to compete with me? Ignore my presence. Keep dreaming. Get out of the way. People's attention captured by me You can only worship and be my follower. Self-confidence is my trump card You can only admire and follow my glamour. Lady Luck is with me, keeping failure outside. This is my era. Rainbow castle. A real kingdom. It's my reality. It's your fantasy. The pride of a rose. A confident face. Don't hide your admiration. Let it out. Music like Beethoven's. Clever as me. It's my reality. It's your fantasy. The stage lights up. The crowd goes wild. I was born to play the lead. Let me sing out hope. They're so off-key. I'm going now. See you later It's Poet. It's him. What's the matter? Is this him? Doesn't look like him. Look. That's him. It has his name on it. How could it possibly be? I knew it! Something's going on between them! Are you blind? Your cell phone... I got it. Poet is silent with An An but sings for me Happy Ning Ning What's this about? I've got nothing to do with it. I didn't do it. Explain it to me. Let me tell you. Early this morning, everyone in the school received this MMS. Ask him if you don't believe me. Did you get it too? Yes, I did. Who's An An? Are you and Ning Ning an item now? That was quick. We're not. My cell phone! Why's he so mad? Poet! Poet! I've been looking all over for you. I've been thinking. For our song, we can start the duet part from the chorus. Stop it! What's wrong? You don't like it? I don't feel like singing anymore. Why? I've never liked singing with others. The night has given Poet black eyes. But he's rolling whites on you. What do you mean? Nothing. We were just a bit confused. Aren't you the perfect duo? What's wrong? He wants to go solo now? Too bad. I like this outfit. I think this will fit you perfectly. Yang Yang. Good timing. Come help me pick. Which outfit would look best on me when I receive the winner's trophy? I really admire your sense of humor. What? You don't think I'll win? Yang Yang, if you have too much time, why don't you work on yourself, and leave others alone? You're so annoying! I don't know what you're talking about. Let's go. Don't you run away! Where're you running to? Stop following me! I'm not telling! Come out. I don't know anything. Come out. I want to talk to you. Come out! Can you not move our chairs? Sorry. You misunderstood. I meant no harm. Following Yang Yang is too hard on you. You're so talented. That MMS is awesome! Really? You like the MMS I made? I knew she did it! You're still trying to cover up. I meant, that MMS THEY made wasn't good, I could make one too. Let me show you, hold on. Let's go. That wasn't what I meant! Why doesn't our girl listen to us anymore? Ning Ning, we transferred you here so you could learn with the best. But look what's happened? What have I done? Had we known, we wouldn't have moved here. Look at the things you did, we are so embarrassed. Mom, what're you talking about? You're still trying to hide it from us? Ms. Lan told us everything. What's going on with you and that Poet guy? Nothing. We told you, no dating. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Ning Ning! Ning Ning! You should've, Bong Bong. You should've, Bong Bong. You, Bong, you, Bong. You you you you. Bong. You should've refused me. Shouldn't have let me pursue you. Time cannot go back. Poet, you're back. My heart's broken. 24 hours of love. Why're you always bumping into me? It's just an MMS. Why are you so angry? Are you depressed? Leave me alone. It wasn't Ning Ning... Don't you ever mention her again! Are you serious? Ok, ok, I'll shut up. Why're you so sad? I thought, I could drown my pain in water. But I didn't know the pain had learned how to swim. Anger inspires a Poet! When you're angry, everything you say is classic. It's the perfect time for you to write a book, the title is "The Story of Ning Ning and l". You're full of rubbish. Just leave me alone. Ok! I'll get you a soda to cool you down. Stay depressed. I'll be right back. I don't know why, I gaze into the sky. As if I've lost something, I don't understand it myself. Memories covered with dust were slowly blown away by the wind. My youthful self does not understand why there's always a touch of sorrow? When raindrops start to fall, you turn around and leave. Only then do I realize the love deep in my heart. I don't know why, I gaze into the sky. As if I've lost something, I don't understand it myself. Memories are like the sea with moonlight shining upon it. My youthful self does not understand why there's always a touch of sorrow? When raindrops start to fall, you turn around and leave. Only then do I realize the love deep in my heart. Why is life no longer exciting? Why do I wander about? I feel more alone in the rainy season. The longliness spreads because I miss you so. Why is the sky so gloomy? Why do I wander about? I feel more alone in the rainy season. I wish you were here with me. I've matured a little. I've learned to believe in tomorrow. The past is beautiful. When the rainy season is gone, there will be a clear blue sky. I've learned a little. I've learned to be caring and gentle. The past is beautiful. When the rainy season is gone, there will be a clear blue sky. When the rainy season is gone, there will be a clear blue sky. You are the rainbow. Kobe? Who else can it be? What's up with you and Ning Ning? Yuan Yuan made that MMS. It's no brainer. Any misunderstanding, go talk it over. What century is this! Can we not talk about this? Alright, alright. You wrote this for Ning Ning? You gave me all the strength, You are my strength. Nice. Welcome to the first Cross-College Singing Competition. All of our judges, are famous personalities in the music business. They will give a fair judgement. The scores will be displayed on this weather chart. The sun means thumb up, with a maximum of 6 suns, and the rain means thumb down. Let's welcome Li Rui from Economic Management College. I heard she is great! Are you ready? Let's give her a round of applause. Yang Yang! You scare me to death. Listen, stop messing around. I'm working on my eyelashes. Any more mascara, your eyelashes will look like hair bangs. Do you like it? I'm telling you, the competition's already started. Poet's not here yet, neither is Ning Ning. Are you listening? Fine with me. Get out of my way. Two of my good friends are devastated. You know what that means? We're all in the same class. Aren't they your friends too? People say friends can take a knife for each other. But instead, you stabbed your friends in the back! Yang Yang. You're selfish, self-serving, narcissistic, arrogant, conceited, boastful, smug, calculating and self-justifying. You should really reflect upon yourself. - Be careful of what comes around! - You. Go away. Yang Yang. Going... Not going... Ning Ning, lunch time. I've made some delicious dishes for you. Why aren't you coming out? Don't cry. I'm sorry. Let me in. Get out. Let me explain. I think this whole thing is just unfair to Poet and Ning Ning. I'm not a bad person that you think I am. I didn't know things would turn out this way. Don't cry. I hate to see girls cry. If it makes you feel better, hit me. Left hook, right hook. One step forward. I'm in danger. Feel better now? Promise me? Yes. Keep a secret for me. I will. You have to swear. In the name of Kobe. Where are you sending me? You'll know in a little while. Hey Yang Yang, where am I going? - Drive. - I wanna get off! Thanks to the musicians from the National Literary College! Let's look at the scores from our judges. Please show your scores.

The shooting star has its own glamour, why can't I learn how to fly? In the past I was stubborn, I didn't know what I looked like. You gave me all the strength, you are my strength. Dawn brings in the sunlight. Confidence becomes belief. I fly in the sky where you are. I finally understand, everyone has a reason for being. There's an expectation called the future. With sweat and courage on my stage I can fly even with my eyes closed. And see colors on the rainbow in the sky. Dawn brings in the sunlight. Confidence becomes belief.
