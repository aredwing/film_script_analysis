HANDSOME SERGE Hello, Tin. - Hello, Christine. - Franois, how are you? - Very well. - Good trip? Very nice. You haven't changed a bit. Wait, I have to get my bag. - You got a package for me? - Yeah, here. - Hi, Franois. - It's Michel. - Yes, I recognized him. - Back for a visit? Yes, for the whole winter. My bag, please, with the Swiss tag. No, the one here in front with a Swiss tag. Let me. So where are you staying? At Chaunier's, since our place - The house is falling apart. You'd catch your death of cold. Ready to go? That's Serge. He doesn't recognize anyone like that - drunk as a skunk. Come on. - Let me carry that. - Forget it. - What has Christine told you? - Nothing, I swear. Maybe she was right not to. Tell me... - What? what happened to Serge? Search me. - He's a wreck. - You can say that again. Back for a visit, Mr. Bayon? The town has changed, eh? - A bit. - Take care and don't overdo it. I will - I mean, I won't. Don't worry. - Who was that? - You kidding? Rita Perrault. Jeez, I didn't recognize her. She's 12 years older. Married with three kids. Hasn't done much for her. - Oh, she's still not bad. - Life's funny. Didn't you use to make out with her? Life's funny. Does the doctor still live over there? Yeah. He's the same old idiot. - Same old town, eh? - And we're sick of it! Tell me about Serge. Come on, give me that! I insist. Serge's married too. You recognize the old guy with him? - Old man Glomaud? - He hasn't changed, only now he's drunk four times a day, not three. Serge married his older daughter, Yvonne. Remember her? - No. Sure, you just didn't notice 'cause she was 12 then. Brunette, scrawny, homely. The butcher Renaud used to be over there, remember? He died. His wife took off to work in Aubusson. His son's down the street. Not a bad butcher. We get our meat there. - Look! They're still there. - What'd you expect? You remember? - You kidding? - We sure had fun. - All five of us shouting into it. Why'd it ever seem so funny? Wasn't much else to do. Why did Serge marry that girl? - You can smoke? - Sure. Why? What did Christine say anyway? - That you were sick. I was, but I'm better. Tell me more about Serge. - It's bugging you, eh? Put yourself in my place. It's kind of a shock. He's such a terrific guy. Why did he marry her? - Yvonne? She was pregnant. He'd only slept with her a few times. Tough break. They got any kids? They had one, but he died at birth. He wasn't normal, one of those - - Mongoloid? - I don't know what you call it. Wait. Is that why he drinks? - It sure hasn't helped. Now they're expecting another, and he's never drunk more. Ah, Mr. Bayon! Hello, Mrs. Chaunier. - Did you have a nice trip? - Very nice. - It's the Bayon boy. - I recognized him right off! - I didn't! - Have I changed that much? You sure have. - But we've all changed too. - Not at all. - I'll show you to your room. - See you soon, gentlemen. - You bringing the suitcase, Michel? - Yes, don't worry. Good thing you came here, because your house - - Yes, I hear it's - - Uninhabitable! Your parents were wrong to neglect it. - I think they're going to sell. Soon there won't be anyone left around here. Here's your room. Looks out on the school. All right? - Just fine. - Where shall I put your bag? - Sorry. On the bed. It's a good mattress. You'll sleep well. Thanks, but I'm better now. Even so, you're here to rest. Need help unpacking? Thanks. Michel will help. You have time, right? Sure. - What about meals? - Whatever suits you, ma'am. - We eat at noon and 7:00. - That's fine. - So that's that. - Yes... that's that. Well, see you later. It's a good bed, all right. Any other boarders here? You nuts? Who'd come here? - We used to have fun. - That's all in your head. I guess I'll take off. You coming? No, I'm going to rest a bit. Don't worry. I'm not dying. What was wrong anyway? A spot on the lungs. I spent the summer in Switzerland, and I'll spend the winter here. A little TB, eh? It was hardly anything. I just have to take it easy. You sure came to the right place. You've aged well compared to Serge. Oh, things just didn't go the way Serge planned. He wanted to go off and study architecture. He even won some scholarships and passed his exams, but it all fell apart. Me, I knew I'd be a baker here all my life. I had no illusions. - A philosopher, eh? - Yeah. Well, I'm off. See you after dinner? No, not tonight. What does Serge do? You mean for a living? He drives a truck for a lumber merchant. Well, see ya. - Thanks for the help. - I'm glad you're back. Beat it, filthy mutt! That's right, Pop. If you want, I can turn that shack into a palace. An honest-to-God palace. Drink... you old bastard. I could build you a real palace. Serge. Serge, it's me - Franois. - Good old Serge. - They're here. What's wrong with him? He's crying. Are you Franois Bayon? So you're Franois Bayon? Want me to help? We're used to it. - Who's the younger one? - The second daughter, Marie. She's a wild one. A new boyfriend every day. Lives up in Mathubert with her father. Would you like dinner now? - No, I'm not hungry. - Not sick, are you? - No, I've got to unpack. - Out so early? - Going for a walk. - But your breakfast - - I'll have it later. - I was going to bring up some hot water. - Don't bother. Come in! No, I just wanted to know where Serge lives. You want to go see him now? I'm sure he's sleeping off yesterday's binge. Yeah, probably. Down at the end of town. Remember Dieudonn's old place? - There? - Yeah. Morning. I hope I'm not disturbing you. I wanted to see Serge. - He's asleep. Come in. Sit down if you want. - I'm going to wake him up. - No, let him sleep. It wasn't for you. He has to go drive the truck. Goddamn it! You have to take the truck to Prefonds. You're fat and ugly. I was drunk yesterday. I thought I was dreaming. Good Lord! Why'd you come back? - To see you. Christine made it sound like you were a goner. You look fine to me. - I was sick, but I'm better now. - You had your breakfast? - No, later. No, Chaunier's coffee is lousy! Whose is this? - Mine. You take it. I'll make more. I'll help you. What's wrong with you? This is Franois Bayon. I know. You were crying on his shoulder yesterday. No kidding? I was crying? Like a baby. - I was drunk. - You can say that again. Here. What do you want? I'm looking for Pop. He was already gone when I woke up. Who the hell cares about Glomaud! Let him be! And don't look at Franois like that. - It's none of your business. - Says who? I can take care of myself. - So you think. She's bad news. - Just ignore them. Get me two bowls. You're drinking coffee? Here. Help yourself. Why come looking for Glomaud here? I thought you two went out to get plastered. - I'll tell you the whole story. - I know. - What story? - The story of my life. And yours, and Marie's... and your father's. When's the baby due? January. A pretty little baby. Be quiet. Just like the first one, you know? Stop it! - A present from your father. - Be quiet, Serge. What do you expect? Come on. Let's go. You going out half-naked like that? I was about to go out half-naked! That was some breakfast you had. - Funny as ever, eh? - Of course. I'm glad. You were kind of gloomy back at the house. It wasn't the time for humor. Franois... what do you think of me? It's bugging you, eh? No, but I'm not an idiot, you know. What do you want me to say? Sometimes things just don't turn out the way you expect. No, I'll see you two up on the square. All right. You coming? He's crazy! Are you out of your mind? - Such a touching couple. - Aren't we? - What'd you talk about? - He's not the talkative type. What's the matter, Franois? I'm very shy. I thought you got over that. Five gallons, please. Thought you got rid of me, eh? I admit I find your behavior puzzling. You ain't seen nothing yet. Wait here. Ask if they've seen Pop. Glomaud hasn't been here yet. Where could he be? It's always breakfast time! - Why do you do it? - I like wine. Lay off. - Listen... - When I need you, I'll call. Poor Franois. Always eager to do a good deed. Get down, boy scout. I'm off. What's the matter with him? Nothing. That's just how he is. How'd he get that way? I don't know. Walk me to my place? Maybe Glomaud's back. You coming? What did he say about me? - Lots of things. - I mean in general. He said you were the only friend he ever had. And how did he say it? Sometimes he was happy. Sometimes it made him mad. You so concerned about what he thinks? No, just curious whether I've changed too. Well, I think you have. You didn't even know me. This way. I remember you. You chased all the girls. Marie. How old are you? Seventeen. Want me to kiss you? - Come to the house. - What about your father? He's not there. - You don't know that. - Yes, I do. I thought you were looking for him. Come on. - See if he's there. - Come on. No, he's not home. You coming? When did you start? Two years ago. Who with? What do you care? I know anyway, so say it. If you already know... Serge? It wasn't Serge? I thought so. His wife know? We only did it once. Answer me. Did she find out? - Yes, he told her. - How'd that happen? He told her one day when he was drunk and angry. We should leave. Glomaud will be home for lunch. You're afraid of him, huh? - Why do you call him Glomaud? - Glomaud or Pop - it's all the same. People used to say he wasn't your father. Really? You mind me saying that? It's funny. You observe us as if we were insects. You really don't like anyone. On the contrary. I like everybody. Why'd you say that about Glomaud? Because... because I love the truth. Are you very sick? I honestly don't know. They won't tell me anything. I was sick. I was afraid I'd die. No, he's not my father, and I think everybody knows it except him. Now let's go. Why do you live with him? Someone has to look after him. You know who your father is? Ma wouldn't tell me, even when she was dying. Serge says she didn't know. All done? - You're all dirty. - I know. It's filthy work. Serge, darling. Leave me alone. God, what a life! What a stupid life! I get up every day hoping to just not think about anything. And now Franois is back. What have I got to show him? That I've turned rotten. - Forget about him. You happy, fat-ass? Can't you see we're scum? What do you think he thinks? Get out of my sight. Come in. Ah, Franois! - Morning, Father. Glad you came by. I heard you'd arrived. - Yesterday afternoon. - Are you better? Yes. I've come to rest. Good idea. Were you very sick? Oh, that's all over now. I prayed for you. How are things going otherwise? I was working toward a degree, but I had to take this year off. - What do you want to do? - I don't know. Make a lot of money. I thought you wanted to teach. I remember you even wanted to become a priest once. Yes, I remember. But that passed. What do you think - has the village changed? The village hasn't, but the people have. I know. Nothing anyone can do about that. It's like they're being pulled under. After you. Oh, I tried a few things. A children's club. That lasted two months. What about the guys my age, like Michel and Serge? What can you do? They no longer believe in anything. - Especially themselves. Are you still a believer? You didn't come to mass this morning. I didn't know. It's not Sunday. It's All Saints' Day. Didn't you hear the bells? No, I was... out for a walk. I didn't realize it was November 1. No matter. You saw my flock. For All Saints' Day service, six people - all old ladies. And once the Lord calls them - I didn't know how to guide them. I couldn't even keep them in church. I don't go to church either, but something could have been done. But nobody did anything! You have no right to blame me. - Morning, Father. - Morning, Serge. So... did he give you a nice sermon? Why do you ask? He gives lots of nice sermons. He gave me one once. Didn't you, Father? - You drunk again? - Not very. Didn't you give me a nice sermon one day, Father? If I did, you needed it... or at least I thought you did. Think I don't understand you, huh? Oh, I know what you all think. You despise me. You won't listen. You've never listened to me. I offer to help, but you won't let me. Here he goes again! Come on. You don't trust me... yet I so wanted to help. Right. Good-bye. You see, Franois? What can you do? Well, good-bye. Come see me when you get bored. - Good-bye, Father. - Him and his fine talk. - Come on, Serge. - What? - He used to be a good guy. Who cares? Look, there's La Truffe. He's come into some dough. - Hello, Brummel. - Hello, Franois. - You recognize me? - Sure. You haven't changed. Hello, Jacques. You on leave? You bet he is! He got eight rebels at once! You recognize him? Jacques Rivette. Ah, of course. So you're doing your military service? No, he's a professional. Yep, I volunteered. Cigarette? They're Algerian. - So you like the army? - It's okay. Damn it! Well, I'm gonna have some lunch. See you around. - Oh, they'll be around. - I've got two weeks' leave. - Oh, then sure. Walk me back? - Let's get a drink first. No, I'm late. Mrs. Chaunier will be furious. - We'll have it up there. - It's 1:00! When do you eat anyway? You're right. Come on. - No, forget it. Enjoy your lunch. - You too. The hell with him. Follow the leader, gentlemen. - Yvonne, is Serge here? - What for? - I want to talk to him. - He's not here. - Then tell me where he is. - I don't know. I want to help him. I don't know. He left right after lunch. He hasn't been himself since you came back. I'm not an enemy. I want to help him. He didn't ask for your help. Just leave him alone. He's not happy. Especially since you got here. Nobody asked for your help. You went off with Marie earlier. Just take care of her. That's all I ask. Leave us alone. - Hello, Doctor. - Well, old man Laroche is dead. - That's awful. - Yeah. Gimme a shot. Franois, over here! That's enough now. That's enough! - Is Franois around? - What? Franois Bayon. Is he around? He was, but he went out again - up to Mathubert. You wanted to see him? - Yes. I don't know when he'll be back. Have a drink while you wait. Your father-in-law will be here soon. I've gotta see him. All I know is he went up to Mathubert. I've gotta see him. Franois, I've gotta see you. Must have headed up to Marie's. He doesn't waste any time. Maybe I'll meet him on the way. He always walked slow. I always had to wait for him. He'd call out, "Serge, wait for me." What must he think? I've been a fool, an idiot! I'm so ashamed! Seeing him show up like that. I should have begged him right away. And that business with the priest - I've gotta explain. The priest's always saying, "Pray, pray!" It's strength I need. "Pray anyway!" "Be strong!" "Pray for strength!" I'll go through here. We figured it out once: It's 20 yards shorter. Old man Laroche will be here tomorrow. And so will I one day. Not like Franois's uncle who's buried in Africa. I might as well face it. That baby ruined everything. Glomaud's daughter's lousy kid! It'd have been enough to help me go on. Two years and I could have passed my exams. And even without my degree! The three of us could have gotten out of here. I'd have worked, made some money. It's this rotten place! That kid ruined it all, Glomaud's fuckin' daughter's kid! All those kids that are born just to die. Listen, Franois. Be a friend. Franois, listen to me. Do something. Help me. Franois! I was sweeping up a bit. Glad to see you're sleeping in now. I get up when I wake up. You shouldn't spend all your time with that girl. Afraid she'll tire me out? Here's your coffee. - That's fine, thanks. - I'll bring your toast. - There's no sugar. - It's on the counter. - Well! - Morning. Come sit down. Here's your toast. Ah, so you're here. - Morning, ma'am. - Morning. - You hungry? - It's 10:00. I've already eaten. There's a dance tomorrow. - Will there be a crowd? - You bet! There always is. You'll dance with me, right? - Of course. Pop was dead drunk this morning. So nobody's home at your place? No, and Serge has been drunk all week too. He's avoiding me. - Because of Yvonne. - You think? I'm sure of it. She hates you. It's not that. It's just a complicated situation. She wants Serge to stay the way he is. She feels inferior to him. He doesn't love her. I don't know about that. I do. Anyway... But that's not important. You finished? Will you come with me? - Why'd you bring up Serge? - No reason. You coming? Come on. I came just to get you. No, I've got to see Serge. - I don't understand you. - You don't have to. See you this afternoon. - Pop'll be home. Fine. I've still got to see Serge. Get off Serge's back. He didn't ask for your help. I know. - Besides, he's not home. - Then I'll wait. He's not always home for lunch. Stop all this nonsense. I like your dress. I made it myself. I look even better without it. Meet you out by the rocks at 3:00? If you want. You're crazy. - Entirely possible. - Completely crazy. - But I like my comfort. What's that mean? Just a big-city joke. - She comes up here for you now? - Keeps her from getting bored. What's going on? You hiding now? Just about. No, I wanted to talk to you. So talk. - Hey, you're not drunk. - Not yet. Listen... there's been a misunderstanding between us. A misunderstanding? Yes, I don't think I've gone about things too well. My poor Franois. At least you haven't changed. Come on in. No, let's go for a walk. If you like. You don't like Yvonne, do you? It's disgusting beneath the surface. Why do they leave it like that? They'd have to drain it and clean it. Someone would have to start. About Yvonne... there's something I have to tell you. Out with it. I think you should leave her. You're crazy. I love Yvonne. Maybe, but you're not happy with her. Franois, you just don't get it. You make all these assumptions, arranging all the little pieces in your head so everything fits. Listen: You don't know Yvonne. She's better than the both of us. What do you think of this: I've been furious at you all week. Your second day here, I needed you but I couldn't find you. I drank like a fish all week because of you. What about that? You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs. - No one asked for an omelet. - I happen to like them. On that note, I'm off to lunch. Wait! See ya. ?ow's it going with Marie? She's a little bitch, you know that? She said you had some hangover. She'll say anything. She's a bitch, I tell you. See you this afternoon. Uh, no, you stay home with Yvonne. Oh, I get it... you skunk. Well, have a good time. Enjoy your lunch. Thanks. You too. No, nothing. Would you like to eat right away? Sure, if it's ready. - Tell me. - What? - He your boarder? - Yes. He's a friend of my family. He just had his hands all over my daughter. Isn't that right? Come here. I'll buy you a drink. I said come have a drink. No, thanks. That's enough now. Then buy me one. Dirty bastard. I said buy me a drink. Leave me alone. You sleep with my daughter but won't buy me a drink? I'll have you know she's a minor. Leave me alone. I forbid you to touch my daughter, you hear? The law's on my side, bastard! She's my daughter. Fine. I'll buy you a drink. Mrs. Chaunier will serve you. I don't want your drink! Keep your hands off my daughter. She's my daughter, so lay off. Sure. She is my daughter, isn't she? Say it. Say it. You know she isn't. There! He said it! He said she isn't my daughter. You're my witness. He said she's not my daughter. Come nosing around our place and making trouble, will you? Wait till you see what's in store for you! Good-bye, all. Don't worry. He's just babbling. I'm not worried. But did he know or not? - Nobody's ever been sure. He's always acted like he didn't, but don't count on it. Who told you? Marie. Don't let it bother you. I'll bring some pt to start with. He wanted to make me say it. What's wrong? He slithered in like a snake. Glomaud! - Let go of me! - Bastard! It's your fault! Why'd you tell me, huh? It's been three years that I've wanted her. Serge, they found Glomaud passed out in the cemetery. - Drunk? - Yeah. They're taking him to the doctor. - He still there? - Yeah, you should go. There they are. - What happened? - Just a little attack. I'll try some homeopathy on him - a little hair of the dog. - What happened? - I tripped. What did the doctor say? Don't know, but it can't be serious. They'd have told me. - A lot of fuss over nothing. - Oh, it keeps 'em busy. Well, I'm going back downstairs. ...your little baby lambs Open the gates for us And hear our prayers In Mother Mary's arms we're reconciled So come and gather in your little baby lambs Come in. I saw you from the window. Glomaud just told me. How is he? You scared him. - It's nothing serious? - Of course not. What got into you anyway? I was furious. It's so disgusting. It's not disgusting. It's practically normal. Maybe you're right. It's true. I don't really understand you people. Things seem so different here. Come on. You saw how they live, didn't you? You realize he'd held himself back for three years? Put yourself in his shoes. Living with her all that time, knowing she wasn't his daughter. What about Marie? Anyone ask her opinion? - I'm sure it's all she thought about. - That's not true. - It is. - No, that would be horrible. No, it's not horrible. It's not horrible. It's normal. Why are you all like this? - Everybody's like this. - That's not true. You're like animals. It's like you have no purpose in life. That's right! And where would we find one? People here make just enough to keep from starving. The earth is granite! They work because there's nothing else to do. Come look. Most of them have at least three miles to walk home. There'll be snow up to their knees soon, but they still want to learn to read. Yes, we're animals. And no one gives a damn. - Then leave. - Join the army? Like Jacques? No, that's no answer. Not everyone can just leave. See what I mean? Yeah, I think so. We need something to hold on to. A guy who's never seen people walk won't try out his own legs. Quite right. Go ahead. Make fun of me. Getting back to Marie... I bet she'll come to the dance tomorrow. Jeez, it's hot for November! Bottle of wine, please. You by yourself? No lady friend? Bah, girls are all - Hey there. Serge was asking for you. - Oh? Where is he? - Dancing. But Yvonne's over on the bench by the window. Yvonne's here too? - Keeping an eye on him. - Marie here too? You alone, Michel? Francette's here. Good Lord! Here you go. Finish it off. Hurry. She just got here. You're late, Franois. It's 100 francs. Let me have your arm. Your arm. - Show that if you want back in. - Very practical. - That pig! He's dancing with Francette. - That bother you? Don't cry. You can have her. Come have a drink? Here you go, boys. Poor guys are thirsty. I've been looking all over for you. Shall we dance the next one? What's wrong? You want to leave now? Leave me alone. - What's eating him? - Search me. Don't stand there like that. You look like a priest. Come dance. Hello, Yvonne. You look tired. Look. He went to Yvonne for consolation. Everything okay? Yvonne's tired. We just got here. Could we go, Serge? Too bad. - Be reasonable. - Go to hell! It's always the same. I've about had it with her! Leave her alone. And get off my back. Come on. Wanna go outside? Scram! I said scram! - Listen - - You won't beat it? - Don't do it. I'll smash your face in! Haven't had enough yet? I said beat it! Go away! You gonna beat it? Can't you see I'm fed up! Answer me! Mind your own business! You gonna get off my back? You're so strong. Enough. I need a drink. You sure showed him, Serge! The city boy got a good hiding. Did you see that, man? You oughta be a boxer, Serge. Mr. Franois. Leave, Mr. Franois. You see what they're like. You'll do yourself more harm than good if you stay. Go! Oh, shit! Come in. - He's here again. - Yeah, I saw. - What do I do? - Send him up. I could say you're asleep. I can't be asleep all the time. No, send him up. Come in. Come in, Father. - I'm not disturbing you? Not at all. I came by twice yesterday, but you were sleeping. - Have a seat. - No, thanks. I just wanted to see you. How are you, Franois? - Fine. - Doesn't look it. It's a little cold, but I'm fine. I'll sit down after all. You haven't stopped by the church again. I haven't been going out much. Yes, seems you've been holed up here for two weeks. Is that true? - You're well-informed. - May I steal a cigarette? - Be my guest. You know... I heard about the incident at the dance and... everything else. I'd like to give you some friendly advice. I think it'd be better if you left. Why? You're doing yourself more harm than good. You're even paler than when you got here. - I'm not leaving. - Why? You came here to rest, and it's clearly - - I'm not leaving. - But why? What's keeping you here? It can't be that girl. No, it's something else. I can't leave. - But why not? I think they need me. My dear Franois... I think you're getting carried away. They don't need you, or me, or anyone else. I think they do. Didn't you see what happens when you try to help? You didn't get it, did you? That's just it. I'm beginning to get it now. I was wrong to hole up in here after the dance. They don't care about words. What do you mean? Serge helped me see. I think they need... an example. And you're going to be their example? Yes! Are you going to do anything? Pathetic little fool! Think you're Jesus Christ? "Do something"! What are you going to do? I don't know. That's why I'm waiting. Locked up in here? What are you waiting for? Want me to tell you? You feel humiliated. Your fine words are pride, nothing but pride. So what? What the hell do I care if it's pride or not? All that matters now is to do something for them. You're right. I was wrong to shut myself up. I'm going out there now to find a way to help them. And I don't care what you think. Gathering wood? Yes, twigs to light a fire. - I'll help you. - No, I have enough. You shouldn't. It's too tiring. We have to have a fire. - When's the baby due? - Next month. There's time. Let me take that. Don't be silly. I apologize for what Serge did at the dance. It's all forgotten now. He was drunk. He was in quite a state when he got home. A lot of it was my fault. I went about things all wrong. He'll do anything when he's drunk. Yeah, like send you out for wood. - He doesn't send me out. - What's he do then? He has his work. Still driving a truck? No, not anymore. I don't know what he does now. He never comes home. He spends nights in a henhouse somewhere, sleeping it off, like my father. I'd actually rather not see him. It's this child that's on the way. He always scares me. He insists it'll be just like the first. Say what I will, he just makes those awful faces. I'm sure this baby will be different. The first one never moved around like this. Sometimes I talk to it, and it stirs as if in reply. What about the doctor? They're all convinced it will be like the first. You still love Serge? Hard to believe, huh? I used to admire him. You remember what he was like. Now I just want to keep him safe, protect him. You know... I hated you when you first arrived. I felt you blamed me for what Serge has become. I thought you wanted to drive us apart. Yvonne, Serge isn't as out of it as people think. - Why? - You were right. Last month we had a long talk, and I advised him to leave you. But Serge set me straight about you. Poor Franois. You thought you were helping. I can tell you love him very much too. It's true. I thought I was helping. He's sure made us suffer! He's often hurt me deeply. Franois, why's he like that? Because he's suffering worse than anyone. Mrs. Chaunier! Mlanie! - What's the matter? - Come down quickly! - What is it? - Yvonne sent me to get you. She's having contractions. - I'll be right there. What's going on? Nothing! - She's home. - And the doctor? She didn't mention the doctor. I'm on my way. Yvonne, it's me. I'll help you. Let's get you into bed. Be brave. Is that better? Ah, there you are. I'm going for the doctor. Keep a close eye on her. Cover up. It's starting to snow. What is it? - Is the doctor in? - No, he's not. Where is he? Where's the doctor? Up in Mathubert. Mr. Glomaud had an attack. Look! It's snowing again. Listen... Won't you come in? Could you come see Yvonne, Serge's wife? She's in labor, and there's no one with her. It's too cold out. Come inside. Good night. - The doctor wasn't home. - What'll we do? He's at Glomaud's. I'll go get him. Send someone else. No, I want to go - alone. - In this snow? - It stopped. - Who's that? - Franois. Doctor, Yvonne's in labor. - I can't go. - I came to get you. He has to come with me. - What about him? - She can't have her baby alone! - Get out! It'll be over by the time I get there. I barely made it last time. It'll be different this time. Oh, sure. Doctor, listen to him. No. He can make you well. He's never made anyone well. - I can help you, give you a shot. - Please hurry! Go to Yvonne, Doc. Leave me alone with my Marie. Are you coming? If that's how he wants it, let's go. - You'd better cover up. - Ah, leave me alone! The boy's got a Christ complex! Shut up and walk! Here he is. Christine, heat up a big pan of water, fast. I thought you weren't coming back. Quiet now. Just pray. Where is he? - Probably some henhouse. He'll come. But we don't need him now. - I'll go. - Go where? Lend me your flashlight. I forbid it! Go back to your hotel! You'll catch your death of cold. Stay here. Help him. Franois, stay here! There you are. Wake up. It's your wife. Your baby's being born. Wake up. Come with me. Please! Stand up. Do it for me. I can't. Get up! Leave me alone. - Come on. - Bastard. In the other room! The forceps, quick! Wake up, Serge. Wake up. It's a boy. How is he? You can't ask for the moon. At eight months, he's no giant. I believed... You hear him?
