I know that there are dictators around the world. . . but you knew that some dictators today. . . apparently, it is assumed, 're addicted to drugs? This explains many things. Hugo Chavez admitted in a speech. . . which, incidentally, was largely unheralded ... he chews every day''''cocoa, morning. He also eats something he calls''cocoa paste.'' That's something addictive. And the dictator Bolivia is your supplier. - What did you say? - It's "coca." It's''coca''. "Ah,''coca'' , Cocoa. . . Cocoa-would not be problem. SOUTH OF THE BORDER I do not know very well name drugs. What a shame. For a moment when he said cocoa. . . I imagined people all over the country Cocoa Puffs''spitting''. They thought they would feel it was great today. I prefer Ovaltine'''' but now is not time for that. What she is saying. . . I also read it. but the reporters wanted to know: ''What is he saying?'' He buys cocoa paste''.'' . . -''Coca''! -''Coca''. Confuse you. Buy the folder. . . Bolivia! The dictator. He is also a dictator? Millions of people watch these programs regularly. Day and night. In the United States. They believe what they see? I hope not. But broadcasters and press more serious in the U.S. and Europe ... follow the advice of Bush ... and divided the world into friends: That is, leaders who are we want to do. And enemies: Leaders who tend to disagree with us. Raul Castro and the dictator Hugo Chavez ... enemy the Bush administration. I think we should see. . . Venezuela's government as a negative force in this region. This is the new Venezuela. Being built with his own money derived from petroleum. Caracas is one of the places most beautiful of the Americas ... due to the wise use of national income from oil. Approximately half of the profits derived from oil sales. The domestic policy is to use oil profits back Condo nation ... buildings for physical, new industries and public welfare. After all, made a big mistake Iraq recently. And the bigger the lie, more often it repeats. We have concrete evidence. . . the presence of members Al Qaeda in Iraq. With the help of the media to repeat statements of the Bush administration ... over 70% of Americans 're convinced ... that Saddam Hussein was involved ... the massacre of September 11. Is there any concrete evidence? Concrete evidence is an interesting statement. The concrete evidence. . . that may come in the form of a mushroom cloud. Why are we here? This is the point. Why are we here, this war? Where are the nukes? Why it took so long for you, Walt, questioning the vice pres. Dick Cheney? We waited until 2007 for you piss him off! It's a fair question e. . . I saw Dr. Sanjay Gupta. . . involved with the troops early in the war. He and the rest of you traditional media. . . refuse to ask questions difficult for our leaders. . . and demand honest answers. So we're in this war. Five years at war. Because you, CNN ... Dr. Gupta did not do his duty and now we're in this mess. The same strategy in Iraq was Employed ... revolts in South America The electoral victory of Hugo Chavez ... despite much opposition ... was a triumph for Venezuelan democracy. But there is a problem with democracy. As it is practiced in the south ... can topple politicians who refuse ... to accept the rules of Washington. According to our leaders, the elected president of Venezuela ... Hugo Chavez, was and continues to be a dictator. The world's worst dictators: Hugo Chavez. . . The Venezuelan president has become more dangerous than Fidel Castro ... never been to the USA. Exxon Mobil says it was stolen President Hugo Chavez. The Latin American strongman. There is something called a clown killer. Maybe he is one. . . . Today, in Latin America. Hugo Chavez is a dictator. Dictators crooks, like Hugo Chavez. If he said he hates Hugo Chavez or Fidel Castro. . . I would say that I hate these guys. On the cover of the book you cite Otto Reich. . . who was ambassador to Venezuela, in 80 years. . . who said:''He is more dangerous than Bin Laden. And the effects of war between Chavez and the U.S.. . . can be worse than September 11.'' Chavez supports terrorism daily. You're not doing anything on drug trafficking. Supports nuclear ambitions Iran, North Korea. Syria's nuclear ambitions. He called on Al Qaeda and Hamas. . . to settle in Caracas. Who is Hugo Chavez? Where did he come from? The fall of the Berlin Wall ... and the collapse of the Soviet Union was seen by millions of people ... as the end of every alternative to Capitalism. Washington seemed dominated by an arrogance without triumphs ... thinking,''Now We can do whatever we want.'' Let's take a look. . . in a mysterious presence on the international scene today. This is how the IMF describes himself. The IMF is an institution powerful financial ... which has members in 186 countries ... but it is controlled almost entirely by the Secretary of the Treasury. Its support to governments of countries low income and little ... is often crucial Condo political survival. The IMF tries to keep a stable global economy ... with a steady stream of money between countries with different currencies. The biggest challenge for the newly discovery domination of Washington ... came from South America A continent that the IMF and the Treasury ... often used as a lab rat ... your experiments in economics. In 1988, the Venezuelan economy was in chaos. The minimum wage was downloading and poverty, the rise for years. The Venezuelan government was on his knees asking for help from the IMF. That attended, dictating a structural adjustment program ... guarantee that more money especially for the poor. When the bus fare was increased. in 1989 ... obeying the agreement with the IMF ... Caracas exploded into a fiesta'''' of attacks and looting. Police opened fire again in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital. . . against demonstrators who were throwing stones. Today is the fourth day of violent protest. . . against the government's decision to increase the price. . . some basic items consumption. The government called the army. Hundreds, perhaps thousands Venezuelans were killed. ''They killed my son!''Was the the woman shouted at the morgue. Relatives anxious look at the list part with more than 200 names ... people who were killed. The morgue is literally ... clogged with bodies the dead. That same month, a group of young officers ... met secretly under the command of then ... Lieutenant Hugo Chavez. And they condemned the massacre, vowing ... that would never happen again. Chavez, say, dropped with a parachute. It was produced within the army. . . when the army killed their own people. Chavez and a group of junior officers gathered. . . and said: No.''were created for this. Our only purpose is to protect the country from foreign invasion.'' Exactly three years later, in February 1992 ... Chavez launched a failed coup to overthrow the government. But the promised attack never happened. The Venezuelan government has avoided Worse, when troops loyal ... dominated a violent blow midnight. After killing 70 people ... the rebel troops failed to overthrow President Perez. And the great news that I bring to all Venezuelans. . . is that all outbreaks been mastered. And they're all arrested, have surrendered. . . or because they were captured. Chavez was caught and was arrested two years. He assumed full responsibility, publicly. Comrades, unfortunately. . . for now, the goals we plan. . . were not met in our capital. Namely, we here in Caracas. . . . we can not control the power. And I, in front of you and the country, I assume all responsibility. . . this movement Bolivarian military. Thank you. No doubt, the coup was illegal. And against the same defenders democracy that Chvez ... later, defend the coup against their own government. Moreover, not gone unnoticed ... that the majority of the population saw Chavez as a hero. And I guarantee safely. . . this will be the last time. . . that Venezuela will by a situation like this. There was much celebration in the Venezuelan capital, today ... after the Supreme Court ordered President Carlos Andres Perez ... on trial for accusations fraud. He is accused of having stolen $ 17 million from the government. In 1997, Chavez decides Condo presidential bid. His greatest opponent is a blonde, They begin to call the race of the Beauty and the Beast. The former Miss Universe employs trembling platitudes ... while Chavez is preaching revolution. And this is what the people want to hear. In Venezuela, the election Sunday. . . may end in an upset leftist government. His supporters called voting for punishment. And it took this man to power, Venezuela. The ex-army they said go fight ... against a tradition of corruption and economic inequality. In 1998, four years after being released ... the inflation rate in Venezuela reach a record 78% ... and the government have done more cuts social spending ... the body politic was totally discredited. Despite opposition from all media ... Hugo Chavez was elected president. For someone who led a coup just six years ago. . . is so popular for the people? We live 40 years seeing thieves dresses politicians. This power that you guys gave me. . . not belong to me. This power is of you. You guys elected the government. . . that will not be the Chavez government. Because Chavez is the people. It will be the people's government! He has promised reforms to raise living conditions of the poor. Enhance democracy. And share the profits country's oil ... with those who were never benefited in the past. In three years, Chavez proclaimed Venezuela ... a Bolivarian Republic. And he began to fulfill his promise. Statues of the beloved Simon Bolivar The Liberator ... watch his homeland, Caracas. He took six South American countries Condo freedom. Bolivar. It's a photo of Bolivar. . . in the fullness of his glory. At its peak, Bolivar. . . At its peak, Bolivar. . . Peru, with all its glory. Moreover, Bolivar thought in terms of centuries. . . and saw the world in terms continents. I'm with you, Chavez! Hello, President! For two consecutive days, Bush administration officials. . . declare your concern with the political situation in Venezuela. We are concerned with some of the actions. . . Venezuelan President Chavez. . . and their understanding of what is indeed, the democratic system. Of course, Venezuela is important. . . it is the third largest producer oil. I would say that Chvez. . . and the Department of State might say that. . . not have good intentions Compared to the U.S.. Chvez's reforms have caused Resistance of the oligarchy of the country. We have a lying government. They're a bunch of bastards. Controlled the Venezuelan media and used it to stir opposition. Also mobilized officers within the armed forces ... and received U.S. aid and Spain. I think the most reasonable for the president and his cabinet. . . is to submit his resignation. . . or disappear from the country. A business man, Pedro Carmona ... was chosen to be the new president. He was taken to make Spain Condo measures for the presidential sash. The coup against Chavez had only one reason: oil. Bush's plan. First, Chavez. Oil. Second, Saddam. -Iraq. -The cause of the coup in Venezuela. . . and the invasion of Iraq is the same: oil. On April 11, 2002 ... groups of Chavez supporters and members of the opposition ... in local marches were different city. Later, members opposition decided ... through the city toward the Government Palace ... where Chavez supporters were assembled. He wants us to be like Cuba. He wants us to be like Cuba. There's no doubt. Chavez, go fuck yourself, you dog! As they approached the palace, suddenly ... shots were fired from buildings, and members from both sides ... were hit in the head. On a bridge, supporters hid ... reciprocated shots of shooters elite. And against the police ... who shot them, two blocks away. The local press shows Chavez's supporters ... shooting the bridge, then showed the street where the people were hit ... by snipers. Manipulating the video to think that supporters of Chavez ... had fired the lethal shots. The press also said that Chvez himself ... ordered the massacre and had used to justify ... the coup that was already happening. In the end, it was this that caused the defeat of Chavez. Armed gangs loyal Venezuelan President ... shots fired from thousands of opposition members. After 16 people killed and hundreds injured ... last night, soldiers surrounded the presidential palace. Mr. President, I was loyal to you. That is what the leader of the army said on national television. But the assassination of Venezuelan today was unbearable. I was under the bridge, that day. And I saw the street was empty, when shots were fired. When I got home and watched CNN publicizing this and other stations ... I was shocked. There was a guy up there, on the second floor of that building. He started shooting, and many we got hit in the head. See you. There was someone up there. . . shooting people the bridge on that side. Shooting at people who came up on the bridge. It was a political coup. They're saying that it was not a coup. It was a political coup. He was arrested by the army. I saw the face of death. They were about to kill me. In front of me. Rifles. Singled out for me. In front of me. Behind me. And I discussed with them. Thinking of Che Guevara. . . who say they died standing. And inside, I said: ''I'm not asking for forgiveness. Nor mercy. I'll die standing.'' Most of the American press endorsed the coup. The editorial board The New York Times wrote ... The Venezuelan democracy'' would not be threatened more ... by a guy stuck a dictator.'' This reference to Chavez unaware of the irony ... what was happening at the hands of a real dictator. Shall be suspended for the positions of Members and alternate members of the National Assembly. Deprive themselves of their positions, illegally occupied. . . President and other judges the Supreme Court. . . District Attorney's Office. . . and members National Electoral Council. Leaders of Democratic Action " (Opposition party) had. . . the Supreme Court a certificate of insanity. . . the president Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez. The press in Venezuela became part of the opposition. . . in the months preceding the coup. That is, were participating. . . and supporting the opposition. Of course, I'm talking about the private press. . . that make up the bulk Venezuelan press reports. And basically, what they did ... disclose any testimony that was opposition that was done ... Chavez is a coward! Coward! He destroyed Venezuela! Many analysts said that was the first blow of the press. And one of the participants the coup said. . . Thanks to the press'' by this blow.'' Thanks, Televen. Thanks, CNT. Thanks, Globovision. Thanks to the media. The former presidential candidate, Irene Saez ... Condo urged the international community who participated in this transition. Today, I'm asking the U.S. government. . . and to all United Nations and R OAS. . . they see what happened Venezuela is a crime! They killed innocent people. And everyone will support the democratic process. . . that exists today in our country. FEW HOURS AFTER THE COUP The IMF, often slow to respond to legitimate requests ... made in Africa starving, was quick to ... show support for the coup. I hope that this discussion can continue. . . with the new administration. We are prepared to help the new government. . . in any matter they find important. The objective was clear. The IMF was making it clear that the overthrow of Chavez ... was of great interest for Global Capitalism. And there's a reason Washington is almost smiling. We import more oil Venezuela. . . than any other country OPEC. The price of oil lowered enough today ... with the removal of Chavez. The reason for the price be dramatically lowered ... probably is because who replaced Chavez. . . will be much more sympathetic to U.S. interests. . . what was this president. Question why do not you kill me. They sent to kill me. But I am a soldier. I spent half my life in the military. And the Venezuelan military, especially the younger ... see me as a leader. The news spread. What happened to the poor ... who marched dramatically to the palace, in large numbers? I voted for Chavez! I Chavez finish his term! Because if it is a democracy, must respect the laws. The soldiers came to say its official ... would not support the coup. The military is with the people! They surrounded me and protected. Next, I rescued from the island. Parachute with helicopters. I am a paratrooper leader. They were my men. They brought me back to the palace, surrounded by people. CARMONA OU Carmon had to flee the palace. A cardinal came Condo island to where I was stuck. . . to make me sign a letter of resignation. Because Washington was asking signed a letter of resignation. I told him:''Let us pray, because they're coming to my rescue.'' He was afraid. While he was there, the paratroopers arrived. Then they carried him back to the palace, me in the helicopter. The cardinal has changed sides. Said: ''Yes, we pray, Mr. President.'' Why something so sloppy? It was a blow shoddy. Why did not kill him when caught? He was not heavy weight. Comparing R Guatemala Argentina to Chile and R. Venezuela 2000, 2002, Guatemala is not the 54. . . and is not the Chile 73. This is a revolution, I said, controversial. . . but armed. The Venezuelan army is with his people! Our president is still Hugo Chavez. We want Hugo Chavez! We want Hugo Chavez! Well, we came back. Good morning everyone. That we continue moving forward with calm and prudence. Continue. The law regards the virtue and honor The editorial committee of New York Times seemed embarrassed ... for giving support the blow to his government. The White House acknowledged today that U.S. officials ... several meetings with Venezuelan opposition leaders ... in recent months to discuss the position of President Chavez. But he insisted, every time, signaled that even once ... that a military option would be acceptable. It was expressly stated the opposition leaders. . . that the U.S. did not support a coup. On Friday, it seems they did just that ... accepting the successor Hugo Chvez ... while simultaneously U.S. allies in the region ... condemned what they saw, clearly, as the military coup. When Chavez returned to power the very next day ... The White House seemed to have decided argued that the blow to democracy. Some Democrats have called to it''deeply disturbing''. It R greater democracy the world. . . governments to defend democratically elected. I think the U.S. had not a very enlightened policy. . . relation R in Venezuela specifically. . . to America or America, in general, throughout the Bush administration. But this incident in particular ... it was the worst possible decision that the U.S. could have taken. She not only caught a committee Chavez's administration ... but has become very difficult for all Latin America. . . like the U.S.. He says the coup in his country was devised by the U.S.. And some in his administration say, in fact. . . you had something to do with it. What he says, to hear this? I have to laugh. Because For starters, there was no coup. Had there been a coup, Mr. Chavez would have been eliminated. There was a complete investigation Department of State. . . and there was absolutely no U.S. involvement. . . In this action Chavez calls a coup. Yes, the U.S. acted, had people involved in the coup. . . before it happened. Involvement of NGOs US-sponsored ... some people who have trained involved in the coup. And in the immediate aftermath of the coup, the U.S. government said ... it was a resignation, not a coup ... recognizing, in effect, the government had made. . . briefly, Return to President Chavez. The coup failed. But just eight months after ... the company management national oil started ... a strike with its workers, joined by dealers ... who dismissed their employees. Again, the strike with support from the private media ... ruined the economy, causing serious recession ... comparable to the worst years the Great Depression in the U.S.. A general strike by opponents the government of President Chavez ... forced the Supreme Court to stop work today. The entire oil industry Venezuela has been closed. This attempt at opposition Chavez also failed. In support, the Cubans sent ten thousand doctors and drug free ... to open clinics for the poor. In an exchange made between Chavez and Fidel Castro ... he offered cheap oil Cuba in exchange for physicians. Some of these people, says that medical ... ''I never saw a doctor.'' Chavez to stop talking it did for reducing poverty. . . which was much smaller by leaders before him. One of my colleagues State Department says. . . Chavez loves both the poor that created millions of new poor. After the government took control of the oil industry ... the economy doubled in size within six years. Poverty has decreased R half ... and extreme poverty, in more than 70%. Here are grown all. Sorghum, sunflower, corn, beans. I want to test the model community property here. For example, a district like this with a group of families. "The owner" is perhaps 100 families, And this group of families owns this whole area, 200 hectares. This farm belongs Condo community. Chavez has a very poor record in terms of human rights. The Bush administration compared him to Hitler. Human rights have become new expression of struggle ... very similar to what was freedom in the Soviet era. But here too there double political standards. Comparatively, our neighbor and closest ally in the region ... Colombia has a record worse human rights. But, as President Uribe is seen as Washington's friend ... and its war against drug trafficking ... gain a pass in the media Chavez does not have that right. Chavez has made a point to appear in public ... with tyrants that Washington loves to hate. We are able to eliminate it. And I believe the time has come to exercise that capacity. We do not need another war $ 200 billion. . . to get rid a strong dictator. It seems to me that in the few days I spent with you ... you develop protection it. But, in principle, is he was shocked. It affected me personally, yes. It was painful for me. It pained me to see the lies and disrespect to the people. But then I realized that is a game e. . . no matter what I do. . . I can dress as a priest, with a fine hat on his head. . . 'll keep calling me a tyrant. The people know the truth. I understand the complicated approach Chavez. After the coup, began to seem a little more like a war. George W. Bush. . . you are a donkey, Mr. Bush. Yesterday the devil came here. And this place still smells like sulfur. This is your desk, is where he works. This is one of my posts Preferred to work. I've never seen so much energy. Never. He said he intended to return here, last night, for work. Yes, I worked last night. See. What time was sleep yesterday? Then, by three in the morning. Three-thirty. Worked-up the two? -Worked, li. I am obliged to study hard. I know the team. It's for fun or pleasure? All this is a pleasure. And went to bed reading this book? That help you have is boring. Who does not walk with us Do not walk with me The first thing to know Chavez is on ... he was born in a shack literally, and grew up in poverty. And it affected his vision of Venezuela. . . and opened his ambition of life to transform the country. I was born a hundred yards there ahead. Welcome to our neighborhood. Hello, my dear. How are you, my life? Look, that girl! Venezuela has spent 50 years without a project. . . but now we have one. Who is that? -Ali? My grandmother. This is the grandmother. An old picture we recover of an identity card. At what age did she die? She was born 70 years before. Result, of course. . . so much work. That was where I was born. In a house palm leaves. And this is the house where I grew up. As it was, at age 14? He was thin. He was very fond playing baseball. -Baseball? -Is. What position? He played as a pitcher. And I was at first base. It's always hard to win. And he just likes to win. Because he is trying very to win. We planted fruit trees here. Tamarind, orange. There was a coffee and a hornet's nest here. My grandmother told me to spoon coffee. You see? I said! Think back to Hugo. His grandmother is there, behind you. His grandmother comes to the door. Can not do that. I'll cry. Action! Oh, no! Broke! I'll have to pay! I'll have to pay! Who is this bike? How's it going, girls? What are you studying? Engineering? She is studying engineering. Hello, Hugo! "How many cows do you have? Ten-giving milk. Ten, giving milk. As each cow produces per day? Four liters each. Four liters each. You must increase this production. The property is yours and his family. -Studied until years? Sixth-grade. Sixth grade? You must go back to school. You must seek Ribas mission. When I came to power, we had to import maize. This is no longer necessary. We broke records this year. Now, we are building processing plants. It is here that we are building Iranian atomic bomb. The pump of corn. The pump of corn. We process our own corn in our own plant. We produce flour. In this case, with the support of Iran. And sell it very cheap the poor, the people. Two hundred years ago, started a revolution. Bolivar started ... releasing all these people the Spanish empire. Thus began the dream of a republic. Free and sovereign. But then came the American empire. . . Empire and English. And split it into pieces. Our history is terrible. This continent want to be. . . We want to be ourselves. Oliver, I want to show you something. See that building? It is an old barracks. I was there the day the military rebellion. On February 4, 1992. Ali was the headquarters the rebellion. Our military rebels Caracas took the palace. I could have died there. Some of my men died. I am strongly connected queles who died that day. Those who died here. In these windows, there is still bullet holes that day. The men who died, I carry with me. And this is part my commitment. As a former soldier, I understand you. The victories of Chavez in Venezuela began to transform ... their own country on offer of hope to others. Powerful social forces gathered in the south ... across national borders. It seemed that the dream of Simon Bolivar had begun to realize. The old oligarchies, privileged light-skinned ... prepare to defend his condition with his strength. And the new social movements, indigenous, darker-skinned ... and, above all, poor. Chavez advanced today over a left ... and proclaims that socialism is the only way forward ... attracting other states South Americans to join ... Condo Bolivarian revolution. Gonna come? Legalizing cocaine. This is one of the main items in the campaign of Evo Morales. . . a pugnacious leftist and consistent critic of the U.S. ... Condo competing presidency Bolivia. He is a man who is not friend the Bush administration. Evo Morales, who presided the union of coca growers ... is the first Indian to be elected president. Morales, who called a month ago President Bush a''terrorist''... is part of a new wave leftist leaders ... South America The stakes here are high. Bolivia has the second largest natural gas reserves in South America The flight from Caracas to La Paz is a straight line to the south ... across the Andes. It was Che Guevara in Bolivia was captured and killed ... by order of the CIA in 1967. Forty years later, in 2005 ... Bolivia, for the first time elected a leader of the indigenous people ... or 70% of the population, Evo Morales as president. As a leader of coca growers, Morales was arrested by the oligarchs. Huge social movements, in defense of coca ... order and against privatization IMF aroused the country. The government decided to sell. . . the water supply of Cochabamba Bechtel, an American company. And this company, one of the things she led the government to do. . . was to pass a law saying that from then, would be illegal. . . Rs caves go to the poor and collect rainwater. . . because it challenged its monopoly of water. Anxiety increases in Bolivia. The government declared state of emergency ... after days of protest, among other things ... rising water prices. Five people, at least were killed. Movements like this Morales drove ... of such movements to power. Some have called Revenge of''Che''. I'm not afraid to say. I am a big fan of Fidel and Hugo Chavez. Others saw it as ... the victory of truth against corporate tyranny. When we landed in La Paz, we all struggle with the altitude. It is the international airport highest in the world. For generations, the indigenous chewed coca leaves ... to relieve The strain on the body. It's not the same as cocaine, as many in the U.S. believe. Coca leaves have got to be chemically processed ... to produce cocaine. But in its native form ... has mild stimulant effects, such as caffeine. A day later, we still felt nausea from altitude ... and President Morales helped us. I'm curious if the president show me. . . or share with me a little. . . These sheets are bad. These coca leaves 're not good. Are not they? Really? They will not do you good. Will not make you well. You're the expert. Must be greener, not so dark. So. . . Washington brought the fight on drugs for Bolivia. . . and President Morales expelled DEA few months ago. The pretext of fighting against drug trafficking. . . that implemented is a control policy. . . not only against Bolivia. . . but many others Latin American countries. The war on drugs part. . . geopolitical interests of U.S.. The war on drugs part. . . geopolitical interests of U.S.. Right. This is better. It's a control. -A control. It consumes so. It consumes so. I invite you. The two hands. I invite you need. . . Put on your hands. Hold. Hold. Take the talinho. . . e. . . What's with the stalks? It is as safe. It's not just political control. Now we are told that plan to commit murder. . . political leaders. Members of the Armed Forces and National Police we'll denouncing as during the past decade, also in this decade. . . were planning to end lives, especially mine. the American ambassador. . . In October (2008) there was the expulsion of the ambassador. . . and in November (2008), the Embassy and the DEA (Narcotics Agency) regulations. How many times have you got arrested! I was tortured. Tortured. E-trapped. Tortured-by what? I was accused of conspiracy and revolt. Tortured by Bolivian soldiers DEA or the U.S.? I was tortured by Bolivian soldiers. . . but were supervised by the DEA. When he was arrested last? In 1997. In 1997. I was a member, but was expelled from parliament in 2002. The plan was to arrest me, imprison me. . . and disqualify me Condo candidate as president. But they failed. For the first time. . . not allowed here no foreign military base. -There is no now, no? "If there is now? No. Before there was now no. Now he is joining. . . Condo bad left wing, to the U.S. media. The media always attempts to criminalize. . . the struggle against neoliberalism, colonialism and imperialism. It's almost normal, my worst enemy is the media. We can say that the goal the Presidency. . . will have their own natural resources? Replenish natural resources. . . is the base of the economy worldwide. As he describes himself? I feel more like a leader of a union president. Because as a manager There is a constant struggle. It's a constant struggle. Sometimes, Ministers tell me. . . ''You're President, not say that!'' Including this one deputy minister. Now I wake up with green leaves. . . You can go outside one instant? Show whether he is awake, I do not know if it is. I always have energy. I want to play football with the president. . . he show me some passes. He likes of Maradona? In football. Sure. . . President Morales of Bolivia, VISIT TO VENEZUELA The new anti-American triangle Spanish-speaking ... Evo Morales of Bolivia ... Hugo Chvez of Venezuela, and Fidel Castro of Cuba ... says that the geopolitical map Latin America ... is changing and he's right. Buenos Aires capital of Argentina. A country that has done everything for 50 years commissioned by the IMF ... World Bank and the U.S. Treasury. In 2001, collapsed. Banks closed. Five presidents fell in two weeks. The president of Argentina resigned today ... because of violence sparked Condo economic downturn. At least 20 people died. Now police fight ... against hundreds of antigovernment protesters. Unions call for a national strike ... against the austerity measures and unemployment of almost 20%. People were Rs streets. Factories were raided. In a large park Buenos Aires ... union of all localities, rich and poor ... met to discuss his fate. Nestor Kirchner was the president ... and refused to agree with the IMF conditions ... forcing them to retreat. When he finished his term, his wife Cristina ... with the same spirit Bolivarian was elected. It seems to me that first in the region. . . leaders look the governed. If Bolivia is r and look at Evo's face. . . her face is the face of Bolivia. It is the first time it happens. One of the last presidents who had. . . Sanchez de Lozada, barely spoke Spanish. . . lived in the U.S.. He had nothing in common with Bolivians. The other day I spoke with a journalist, he said. . . Hugo Chavez wants to export'' their revolution. . . its changes, its socialism. . . Condo Latin America and this should not happen.'' I was told some European journalists. That way they think those colonialists. . . everything that could in its "colonial lives" and who always treated installing your ideas they had in other countries. We who have no experience in the region internal colonialism of one country over another. Instead, we suffer in the hands of colonialism. I do not think anyone would want to impose anything. Instead, believe in integration. . . respecting differences, the identity of each country. . . culture and political processes, ever are the same. . . because we are different people. . . with companies and different histories. What do you think the press call Chavez a dictator? I think I never experienced in modern governments. . . in Latin America or worldwide. . . an election that many had like those of Hugo Chavez I think it's the 13s. election. I have not seen many dictators elected 13 consecutive times. One can agree or not with what he says. . . but to say that there's freedom Venezuela. . . to say what one thinks, do not believe it, otherwise. How many pairs of shoes do you have? How many pairs of shoes do you have? I do not know, never told. I do not understand, never ask a man. . . How many pairs of shoes he has, or pants. Always ask women. Okay, now established your credit. . . -Mrs. President. Thank you. It is much better indoors. Bring a photo of May 25, 2003 my desk. . . when Kirchner took over. It's a great shot. I'm with old friends. I want to see, is really great. Let's see if the find. How can men be so slow, my God. For how much longer gonna be here? This is May 25, 2003. Kirchner was inaugurated. Fidel laughing. And I like the first lady. Argentina had a recession terrible between 1998 and 2002. Can you describe the role of the IMF. . . and what Argentina did out of recession? Terrible was terrible. The IMF recommended a wave privatization. . . non-intervention of the state, that the market would solve everything. and maintained the convertibility (1 peso = 1 dollar) to maintain this fiction. . . in addition to the country into debt financially brutally. . . because the capital was (IMF). . . and had an interest rate impressive in Argentina then they withdrew. And caused the greatest debt Argentina's history. . . that reached up to 160%. . . He left us 25% of population without work, over 30% misery. . . Finally, everything that can be considered as a social tragedy. Then it all explodes in 2001 and 2002. . . with a huge currency devaluation. . . which meant a huge transfer of wealth. That's what Kirchner inherited on May 25, 2003. So we started a policy substantially different. . . with a big fight with the IMF. There is a widespread notion ... that the U.S. has ignored Latin America ... and their Chambers of Commerce helped the rich ... but wounded the working poor. Today, Argentine President ... with worries about the policy American Chamber of Commerce ... seemed not to rush to embrace his U.S. counterpart. And oddly, President Bush agreed. It's not easy to receive these people. Maybe it's not easy I receive. Many say they played an innovative role and heroic. . . to challenge the IMF the first time. . . and successfully. I would say that one of the highlights his personal life. . . would be the conference with Bush Mar Del Plata? I think so. That day, Latin America defeated. . . the intentions of the first world power. . . represented by the policy President Bush with the FTAA. And all we act collectively. Never forget that day. So much so that kept the chair that meeting in my house. That day we had the courage. . . not to speak over the radio when man is not. . . or when the representative is imperial policy is not. . . but we act collectively and coordinately. It was one of the most important steps we gave in the region. How when he says''not'' to a banker? You're subversive, leftist a thief, scoundrel. Was there a moment, like a movie. . . where one of the main bankers bent. . . in the eye of the President and said. . . Mr.'' Kirchner, realizes the implications of what he says?'' Always. When one sees political very friendly. . . very friendly these sectors. . . something's not right. Because these sectors only think in profitability. . . and not on society as a whole. Now, during this mandate facing the current Chair is a different time and more difficult. I had to pull the country out of hell. The president must do the economy grows. . . ensure that the distribution profit is fair. The sectors that control the economy. . . they always want to profit and never share. . . they do not want to share, are the sectors that react. Corporately respond because want a country for a few concentrator, where much just stayed with the Argentine people President Bush Condo meeting came ... talk about your policy Free Trade ... that says it will help alleviate poverty ... and create jobs in the region. There were some uncomfortable moment with Pres. Bush that night? I say there's not kneel to power. . . be rude not to say you need to talk. . . queles we explored rs and who opposed our actions. We had a fight in Monterrey. And I said that here the solution to boost quickly. . . What is the solution that will be have to do now would be a Marshall Plan And so he stopped and got angry. He said it was a crazy idea the Democrats. And what we have to do here and the best way to boost it ... "The U.S. had strengthened the war, "she said. So he said. The war? He said that? He said, were his exact words. He suggested that South America go to war? He spoke of the USA. Never said South America Democrats were wrong. Economic growth U.S.. . . rs due out several wars they had. He was very clear. President Bush is. . . Well, it only 6 days left, right? -Yes. Thank God. Your work here is hampered by Hugo Chavez .. Socialist President Venezuela ... who now had the unusual gesture to bring the meeting ... the demonstrators in a stadium Football next. He said he wants to bury the Free Trade Agreement (AFTA). The FTAA be damned! From Argentina to Paraguay ... where the ex-bishop Fernando Lugo, a liberal theologian ... win the election and ended decades of leadership ... the pro-Washington, the Colorado Party. . This is the old palace of General Stroessner. The dictator's mansion. My family was persecuted by Stroessner. My father was arrested 20 times. It's a paradox I live now where Stroessner lived. Can you imagine? These changes in Latin America in the last 10 years. . . were incredible, really. Especially since 2003, 2004. This resulted in some form Liberation Theology? Yes, certainly. . . believe that the roots of change in Latin America. . . began with a new way of thinking. There are 15 or 20 years, no one could imagine. . . that an indigenous become president. . . that two women were presidents of two important countries. . . a metallurgical would be president. . . that a military would be president. . . and even less that a bishop would be president. I believe that here there is a new political actor, they're social movements. The opposition has effectively groups. . . that historically were privileged in Paraguay. . . especially after after not have been easy make changes in the country. Here is a group that was privileged historically. . . government with the country's resources. We want are consistent with the option of Liberation Theology. . . here if you happen to be privileged. . . has to be the ones historically overlooked: The indigenous, the landless, the illiterate, those without health they're the ones who now must be the first to be met. The changes are having an Fair administration, transparency ... institutions to recover their dignity. . . and economic growth, but with plenty of social equality. I can not get away from And we, as Saint Paul said. . . ''One sows, one fertilizes, farms and other one will reap.'' Is there any phone calls from Paraguay to the IMF? Yes, we have. -What is the debt? -US $ 2.3 billion. Chavez lent R Argentina $ 6 billion. Do not do that. Chavez would make the loan if I talked to him. How old is it? -57 Years. "He has time. He is very good. Well, Fernando Lugo, is a very nice man. . . and a very good man, I think. I wish you good luck. Thanks. This is something that I will always remember. In Brazil, the changes were political rather than structural. Lula da Silva was elected President of Brazil ... with the largest margin of victory the country's history. Mr. da Silva is the first leftist President ... working class the country's history. He was president of union and political prisoner ... when the right ruled Brazil ... which has 9 a. higher economy in the world ... and faces an economic crisis. The Bush administration supported his opponent. President Lula was, leader of the working class. Lula may not have confronted IMF directly ... but refused any Brazilian complicity ... the destabilization plan Venezuela or Bolivia. Now at the end of his term as president ... I think so combative as in the beginning. Sees the possibility of a bank. . . a union of interests South American Financial. . . along the lines of the European Union? Is it possible? Thank you. Thank you. Want to talk to Hugo the output? My brother. This is my brother. The last two presidents were on my list ... Raul Castro, Cuba's ... and Rafael Correa Ecuador. Correa shows his dissatisfaction with Bush. . . saying that the policy U.S. in Latin America ... is responsible for the appearance of leftist movements ... throughout the region. When Washington rejected Correa's requirement ... removing the military base of his country ... the new president required equity. A military base Ecuador in Miami. Chavez began a new era in Latin America. For us, the moment is very difficult to make changes. . . we want to do and that the country needs. Now that many governments have friends in the region. . . just as President Chavez. . President Morales. . . the Kirchners in Argentina. . . Lula in Brazil. . . imagine what it must have been difficult 10 years ago. . . when he (Chavez) was absolutely alone. . . Latin America in a full of neoliberal governments. The main and perhaps only Chavez's influence is that it gave us an example many things. What is your position on the United States? We love the USA. I lived there. I studied there. We love the people too the United States. But obviously, the policy outside the U.S. is questionable. So when they wanted push us to maintain. . . the basis of their military in our country. . . a base for foreign not pay a rent, do not pay anything. . . And they accused us of being extremists not wanted by the base. . . If there's no problem having a base in a foreign country. . . established one condition very straightforward. . . would maintain the base U.S. at Manta. . . since the Americans would allow us to an Ecuadorian base in Miami. If there's problems with foreign bases. . . then we can have one there. Do you accept the presence AED in your country? What they do is a sort of consulting. . . but we are limiting the influence they had. They financed large part of our forces. We are changing that. Let's follow fighting drugs, but independently. Rafael Correa is now considered. . . a left potentially bad. . . with Chavez and Morales. He sees this, or thinks it is favored by the American media? With all due respect, knowing the American media. . . I'd be more concerned if they speak well of me. Good night. The bad news about plans murder ... was given today by the Committee Intelligence of the Senate. The Committee released a report which states that ... U.S. government agents ... initiated plans to kill Two foreign leaders ... engaged in plans to kill two others ... 're involved in one more ... and that the CIA knew more Two murder schemes. Fidel Castro is alive and well ... although 8 of the CIA planes to kill him ... and a plan to harm your image ... making his beard fall. Some of the goals of the plans murder ... were very knowledgeable people. Che Guevara, Raul Castro, brother of Fidel Castro of Cuba. In January, the Revolution, the emergence of Chavez. . and his victory after the coup. You are the grandfather, godfather (godfather). . . and what about this? No. Perhaps the first, but not a sponsor. 're All adults, go alone, got their own ideas. . . and bringing new ideas. For example, socialism What do you think of these heirs? There is optimism? They're not heirs our spare. We are all definitely heirs something, someone. Cubans are heirs the liberators of the Americas. . . starting with Bolivar, Sucre. . . Toussaint L'Ouverture, The Haitian. The first and only revolution successful. . . led by slaves in world history. We are the heirs of most recent fights. . . other fellow which fell, like Che Guevara, etc. .. Now some are young, as Presidents Correa and Chavez But each one is learning their own knowledge. . . and knowledge from the mainland, of humanity. That's the reality. We are not the sponsors, and they're not the heirs. And the Cuban Revolution came the half-century as a whole. And the Cuban people, despite explosive personality. . . learn to be patient. And this is an incredible thing. And this explosive combination, As Fidel said of Europeans. . . Spanish on our side. . . and our African side. We are ready to more than 50 years. been here for interviewing Fidel ... and talked with him for 3 days. He was a lone wolf. I was isolated ... the island did not have advertising, had not corporations. . . was a return the other was. He was the mouse that roared, who fought ... for 50 or 60 years. As the old man and the sea. As the old man and the sea, is a sad story of Hemingway. The old man leaves, fishing this giant fish ... What is the revolution in 1960. And when the coast bring R, he was eaten by sharks. Still, the man attempted, was noble. And so it Hemingway gave that strength of character. . . beauty of this loss, the tragedy of the effort. What I like about Castro was he told us ... there is a pendulum in history that these things change. And he saw in a way strange ... this whole thing, in 2000, would change. And hopefully we can see the end of predatory capitalism. I think there a benign capitalism. . . but there is a predatory that destroys people. And we saw it all your life. Chavez faces the same Castro challenges. I think it has more allies. What struck me in him was the force. It's a bull. He has the same strength Castro had in 2003. This is reminiscent of how Castro was strong. He maintained the strength, Chavez retains power. Why do you think the U.S. hate Chavez so much? That is obvious. He is a as big threat to the system. . . when Castro was. It is a great example, and if it is successful ... be the first time in the history of Latin America ... except for Castro ... he took an entire region, almost every continent. . . away from the IMF and the control U.S. economic. Shortly after I returned North to America ... another president entered the scene. If there is someone. . . who still wonders. . . The dream of our founders is alive in our time. . . who still questions the power of our democracy. . . tonight is your answer. I hope Obama is a new Roosevelt. . . Obama and implant a''New Deal''. . . not only to the U.S., but for all continents of the world. Since virtually all international organizations ... IMF to the Security Council UN ... are controlled in large part by the U.S. ... the new Bolivarian Society strengthen regional links ... to speak with the U.S. with one voice. This happened at a meeting of hemisphere leaders ... in Trinidad where most South Americans ... refused to sign any document in the absence of Cuba. That was not reported with due respect in the U.S. media. If this model is multiply in other continents ... American hegemony will be seriously undermined. A Conversation with Chavez Good or bad decision but certainly historic, right? My president was to Trinidad. . . and all I got was a lousy t-shirt of Che Guevara. Barack Obama was Summit Condo of the Americas in Trinidad ... and saw the whole continent supporting Colombia and Mexico ... ready to face them. Who is the man laughing President Obama ... and why everyone is talking about about these images? Embracing dictators, the villains ... Corrupt politicians, the gang the Kirchners in Argentina. . . Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua, the biggest pedophile of the West. . . what it does is give credibility U.S. enemies. Friends and enemies quickly will take advantage of a situation. . . if they think they're dealing with a weak president. But Obama not behaved like Bush. He met with Chavez that made him an offer of peace. Is unlikely. . . as a consequence I have handshake. . . or had a conversation educated with Mr.. Chavez. . we are putting at risk the U.S. strategic interests. In particular, from what I heard ... The new president assured Chvez that in his government ... there will be no further attempts destabilization ... or otherwise interfering in the internal affairs of Venezuela. It is true that this is a small step forward. The 50 years were not in vain. Because of this we Chavez. . we Bolivia. . . we Nicaragua Ecuador, Paraguay. Some are called center-left, like Lula. It is a great rebellion. . . people against imperialism in Latin America. In a multilateral world, can not have a potency to decide for everyone. It's bad for one's potency. Absolute power is always bad. It's what I always say to Chavez I'm very close to Hugh, he is a friend. But I must tell you collectively building. It takes can not be just him. Otherwise, when he is gone, the whole process will end. The belief that only a one can guarantee. . . is like believing that a single power can solve all world problems. The euphoria and triumphalism that existed after the fall of the Soviet Union. . . virtually disappeared. Everybody knows it's a more difficult to be confronted. The size of the Hispanic population United States. . . is now greater than ever. The new immigrants serve Bridge to South America The interesting question. . . that in my moments Utopian I do. . . is whether the changes in America South. . can travel this bridge Hispanic population in the U.S. ... and produce something that no of us can predict. In Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay ... hostile to the Bolivarian Circles. Still, they won. There is a lesson here to be learned. I hear he is a great admirer ... the year 1770, the revolution Indians against the Spaniards. . . Tupac Katari. Tupac Katari was brutally killed, quartered by the Spanish Empire. And the moment that would be dismembered, he said. . . ''I die, but one day come back as millions.'' Now we are millions. And perhaps this is one of things that keeps us going. The optimism, faith, hope. . . and concrete evidence that, yes, You can change the world, change history. It is possible, Oliver!
