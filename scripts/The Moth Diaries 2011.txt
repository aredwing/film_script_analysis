I'll be able to read it later and know exactly what happened to me when I was 16. - One of us isn't gonna be here And one of us is gonna be running Off alone to the great unknown You're not me You're a model of freedom All you need are your kicks when you need 'em Come and go Caught that slow all right - Maybe this year, I'll get on the A squad for field hockey. - Field hockey, my God. Seems so unlike you. Let me guess. Lucy does it. - Oh, Mom. - I forgot the world revolves around Lucy. - No, I love it. Sometimes we even get up at 6:00 a.m. to practice. - Hey, ooh, yeah, you gotta be leaving Say what you want What you say, say anything No one knows just how deep it goes We are old in your teenage tyranny And all you need is a hunger to feed I've got my own secrets, though Say what? - Here, Mom, I'll take it. - No, but- - No, it's fine. - We are doomed, but we wanted more - I'll call you. - It's the ride we take The many-winged escape It's the bough - Becca? - Oh, my God! Here. You have no idea how much I've missed you. - I missed you too. Is your room next to mine? - Yeah, here, let me show you. This is your fireplace, and the bathroom is huge. - This is gonna be the best year ever. - Wuh-whoa! - You better hide it before Miss Rood sees. - Ah, come on. - Charley, you can't get expelled on the first day. - You can't worry on the first day! - So what'd you bring us? - Just some downers I stole from my mom. - Well, I got chocolate in Geneva. - You guys hear about Annabelle? She's been hooking up with two different boys from Langley College. - What? - Such a whore. - Jealous? At least she has sex. - Look who's talking. - I've had lots of sex. - Girls don't count. - Why not? And I've done boys. - One boy. - Oh, are you still all pathetic virgins? - Well, I am, but not for long. I've met someone. Hey, Lucy, what about you and Jason? - I broke up with him. - Yeah, on Facebook. How cold is that? - What about you, Becca? - I don't know. We'll see. - It's the times, we say That no one's gonna take your place - Oh, the apple, the apple! - Ew. - So did you guys hear? The new English teacher is a guy. - Wait, do the dykes who run this place allow that? Like, he's probably gonna have to wear a plaid skirt and kneesocks, like Miss Bobbie. - Charley... - I saw him. His name's Mr. Davies. He's actually really cute. - And he's a poet. - Wait till he finds out about Rebecca's dad. - Charley. - Not cool. - No, not about that. About him being a famous poet. - He wasn't really famous. - Let's go play some hockey. - Let's not. - Come on, yeah. That's exactly what we need, yeah. - Seriously? On the first day? Why do you have to kill me on the first day? - Oh, I've longed for these tubs. - I know, sometimes I hate it so much when I'm here, but I just miss it all the time when I'm at home. - How's your mom? - She just sat in her studio and painted, listening to the same music over and over. The same music my dad- my dad was listening to when... - Rebecca, I want you to meet a new girl, Ernessa Bloch. She'll be in the room across the hall. Please help her find her way around. - Sure. It's easy to get lost. Did they tell you this place used to be a hotel? Um, like, 100 years ago. This place has a lot of old nooks and crannies. - Breakfast is at 7:30, morning assembly 8:30 sharp. You must apply to me for permission to leave the school grounds. You may use one of two staircases to get to the dining room. The left one also goes to the library. - It's so, so different from the first time I came to Brangwyn two years ago. My father had just died. My mother was a wreck. So I was sent here. Every night, I sat in my room alone, aching for my father. And then I met Lucy. She was so confident, carefree, and normal. She taught me how to be happy again. That's why I love her so much. I wonder what her secret is. - Well, everyone's got one. - Alcoholic mothers. - Nasty divorces. - Parents who don't care about them. No one comes to Brangwyn unless something bad has happened to them. - Except for me. I'm the only boring one. - Believe me, I wish I was like you. - Good morning. It gives me great pleasure to welcome another freshman class to Brangwyn school. - I scored. Party in your room tonight? - Okay. - Amen. - Your life here will be a moral and spiritual journey that will prepare you for whatever life awaits you outside these gates. - She's never going to change that speech. - No. - Oh, I want to sign up for practice. - Okay. I got to grab my books for English... Check out the cute new teacher. I'll see you at quiet hour? - I said I would spend it with Dora. - It's our first day back. - Okay. I can see her another time. - Okay, great. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Ernessa... Bloch. - Yeah, I saw you last night. How are you finding everything? It's a little strange. - It must be hard, with everyone already knowing each other. - What's that? - It's a friendship necklace. My friend Rebecca gave it to me. - It's really pretty. Would you show me around? I don't really know where I'm supposed to be. - Yeah. Yeah, come with me. - In all of the classic Gothic horror stories, we see expressed some kind of anxiety about the modern world. In Bram Stoker's Dracula, some critics see an anxiety about female power, female sexuality, a fear that the pure Victorian maiden would be transformed into a ravenous beast. The story is a shape-shifter, just like the vampire itself. You find it in different forms in almost all cultures, but there are three things you find in every vampire story: sex, blood, and death. Becca? Just want you to know, I'm a great admirer of your father's work. I'm going to be running a poetry workshop later this term. I was hoping you'd take part. - Yeah. - Okay, good. - Um, thank you. Are you lost? - No. This is one of my favorite places here. - The passageway? It's so dark; I always just run straight through. - I like looking out the windows. - I'm actually going to see Miss Norris. She teaches Greek. I have lessons with her on my own because no one else wants to do it. - I used to study Greek and Latin. I was very serious, even though I was a girl. Then other things intervened. - Okay, well, um... I'm late for my class, so... I'm no Barbie doll I'm not your baby girl I've done lots of things, and I have made mistakes And I am not as pretty as those girls in magazines So what if I'm no baby bird Hanging on your every word Nothing ever smells of roses That rises out of mud Why do you love me, why do you love me? Why do you love me? It's driving me crazy Why do you love me? I get back up, and I do it again Get back up and I do it, do it again - Whoo! - So how's Mr. Davies' class? - She has a huge crush on him. And he's just lapping it up. It's sickening. - Jealous much? He's actually really cool. Hey, why don't you switch? - No, I like the Romantic poets. - I thought you hated poetry. - No, I just never read the right stuff. You know, Ernessa says poetry is the purest of all the arts. - Ernessa? - She's incredibly smart. She's gonna help me with my German. She speaks it perfectly. I'm just gonna go say hi. Hey. What are you reading? - It's a book I found in the library. Sit down. - What's it called? - It's called... - Slow emotion - Hey, did you hear anything last night? - No. Why? Did you? - I thought I saw Ernessa pacing back and forth under our window, and she was in her bare feet. It was kind of weird and creepy. - She has trouble sleeping. So what? - You don't think it's kind of strange? - She has issues. Stuff with her family. She's a nice person if you give her a chance. - I'm sorry to interrupt. I usually use this room. I didn't know you played the piano. - I hardly ever play anymore. - You play so well. How do you do that without looking at the music? - My father was a musician. I inherited everything from him, just as you did from your father. - I didn't inherit anything from my father. - Are you sure? - I'll find another room. It's wonderful here, Daddy. - I wanted to show you this place. - It's so beautiful. - It's always peaceful here. - I've missed our walks so much. I thought I would never see you again. - Don't be so sad, Rebecca. I'm always here. - I love you, Daddy. - Thank you for joining us, Rebecca. - I'm sorry. - That's okay. We're just talking about CarmiIIa. Now, with Carmilla, we are looking at one of the originators of the Gothic tale, 20 years before Bram Stoker wrote Dracula, and I think it's fair to say, it influenced him greatly. All right, let's talk about the character of Carmilla. A mysterious stranger comes from the West and begins to take over the narrator, Laura. - "Sometimes with gloating eyes, "she drew me to her, "and her hot lips "traveled along my cheeks in kisses, "and she would whisper, almost in sobs, "'You are mine. You shall be mine. You and I are one forever.'" - That lavender bath oil feels so good. - I know. I can smell it from here. - What are you reading? - CarmiIIa. It's for Mr. Davies' class. - What's it about? - Hey. - You know, it's Gothic fiction. - You're burning red. How do you stand such hot water on your skin? - We always take hot baths before bedtime. It's relaxing. - So I've brought us a list of verbs to conjugate. Let's start with baden, to bathe. - Baden. - Mm-hmm. Beginnen. - Beginnen. I'll show you how far I got. - "The vampire is prone to be fascinated "by particular persons. "With an engrossing vehemence resembling the passion of love, "it will never desist until it has satiated its passion and drained the very life of its coveted victim." - Hello. - Do you have a minute? - Of course. Here you go. Please. - Um, it's about Carmilla. - Okay. - If she's in love with Laura, then why does she want to destroy her? - Well, I don't know that she wants to destroy her. She wants to control her. The vampire's a very lonely figure. Carmilla wants a companion in her existence. She wants someone to be all hers, forever. - But why does Laura want to be friends with someone who's so obviously evil? - I suppose she's been hypnotized in some way. Remember, the vampire needs the consent of the victim. - The vampire needs the victim's consent? - Yes- well, in a way. Remember, in Dracula, he can only enter if the victim leaves the window open. - It's Lucy's fault for being such a weak person. - Lucy? - No, I mean Laura. It's Laura's fault. - Mm, in a way. - Thank you. It's been a big help. Hey, Lu, do you have the shoe polish? Did you get new shoes? I don't think those are allowed, are they? - These are Ernessa's. - And why are you cleaning them? - She doesn't know how. She's never had to polish her own shoes. - It's really not that hard. I'm sure she could do it if she tried. She never eats. Have you noticed? - What? - Ernessa, she never eats anything, ever. - Maybe she's anorexic. - Remember Annie Patterson last year? Her face looked like a skull, and she still wouldn't eat. - I just don't think that'll ever be my problem. - When you lose that much weight, your body can't even keep itself warm, and you begin to grow fuzz all over your arms. You can see it when they stand against the light. They call it "the glow." Does Ernessa glow? - No, and I don't think she's starving herself. Look at her. She has a perfect body. But if you think she has anorexia, you could just go up to her and feel her arms. - This is really fucking stupid. - Sorry. - Whoa. - She's too sensitive. - What a way to start a morning. Do you think Ernessa's hooking up with someone at Langley College? - A boy? No way. - She's slipping out at night. - What do you mean? - I heard her door open last night. And she didn't come back in, at least not until after I fell asleep. - Really? - It's happened before too. - Weirdo. Maybe she goes out to score. - In the middle of the night, go into town? - Let's follow her. See where she goes, what she gets up to. - Can you see anything? - I don't know. - It's fucking freezing. What does Ernessa do out here? - She watches us sleep. Hey, you know when you see the school from here, you can totally imagine what it looked like back when it was a hotel. Guests drinking tea on the lawn. - When I see the school from here, I think about how easy it would be to just walk out. - Well, I don't see Ernessa, and it's cold. Come on, let's go, before the caretaker creeps on us. - Dora, wait up. - What are you doing? - Come on. - Deanndra, comment for short skirt. Charlotte, third comment for messy hair. Detention. Rebecca, comment for dirty shoes. And Mrs. Rood needs to see you in her study now. - How can she give wardrobe advice? It's like we're in, like, duty. - When I was a little girl, the farmers said that a nosebleed was a sign of good luck. You really shouldn't be sad about these cheap, sentimental things. I feel like sweeping them all into a pile on the floor. - That's cruel. Mrs. Rood lost her husband. She needs these things to go on living. - I don't need things to remember my father. - Neither do l. Before Ernessa came here, I was getting better. I was happy. Now all the darkness has come flooding back. It's like she's invading my mind. Even when I'm alone, I can't escape her. There's this disgusting smell that comes from her room: sickly sweet but rotten. Why doesn't anyone else notice it? Lucy? I haven't seen you all day. Where have you been? - I was busy. Why did you complain to Mrs. Rood about Ernessa's room? - Lucy, it's right across the hall from me, and it smells really bad. - I thought you would be more sensitive, considering. - Considering what? - Her dad killed himself. - I didn't know. - I thought you, of all people, would understand. - November 9th. His last day on Earth. Lucy didn't remember. She never said anything. We spent it together last year. - What's your favorite memory of your father? Let's think about that. - If I had to pick one moment, it would be the night we saw the Luna moth. - Look. There. You see it? I've never seen a moth like that before. - The Luna moth was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Why weren't those things enough for him? "A person may become a vampyre if he dies unseen." My father wanted to die unseen, like an animal who wants to curl up and die alone. - Don't feel bad about your father. Some of the greatest artists went mad or committed suicide. Some people find great joy in the prospect of death. Just thinking about it can be a comfort, like lying in your bed and pulling up the covers. The moment of death is ecstatic. It's the most joyful sensation. You're being born into a new existence. - Is my father's illness in my blood too? I wonder when he did it. How much did it hurt? And did it really take the pain away? - Party in my room tonight, FYI. - Okay. - Hello, she. What'd you bring me today? - Hey, so tell me, are you nervous? - Of doing it? - Yeah. - Well, Kiki said it wouldn't hurt that much. - I know. It's just the whole thing. I mean, what if it feels weird? Or what if you change your mind right in the middle of it? - I don't know. Part of me just wants to get it over with, you know? - Don't do that. - We have to. It hides the smell. - I mean it. I'll have to leave. It'll suffocate me. It's so sweet. - All right. You guys move to the window. We'll just freeze our butts off. - Right. - How does it feel? - It's fine. I don't even feel anything. - Are you serious, Becca? - Are you okay? Just lie down, okay? - Don't cry about it. - Speaking of yesterday, of life. Eccentric. - What's going on? - I need to tell you. Listen to me. I need to tell you, tell you what it's like. When I first came here, we took the boat over. I kept looking at the gray waves, and I kept saying to myself, "Jump, jump." But it was too cold. The Brangwyn Hotel. I arrived with the same secret that you did: a father's suicide. My mother brought me here because she wanted to put an ocean between his death and me. But to me, an ocean was nothing. Everywhere I went, I heard my father's voice calling to me. - Yes! - Charley. - Oh, my God! Whee! - I have this wonderful idea. What you need to do... - Come on. - Oh, my God! - Okay, guys, watch this. One, two, three! Hey, Miss Rood, can you get my chair? Oh, my God! - Ernessa should never have given us those crazy drugs. Charley's been expelled. The school wouldn't give her a second chance. - This is all Ernessa's fault. - She thinks she can get away with anything and no one can touch her. Dora? Are you awake? - Yeah. - Okay, I need your help. - What? - I'm gonna go along the gutters to see what's inside Ernessa's room. Can you watch out? - What if Ernessa sees you? - I'll just pretend I'm going to Kiki's room. - Okay. Hurry up, before someone sees you. Becca! You've got to come now. Get back to your room. Come on. But I saw- - Go on. Now, go on. What was wrong with you last night? I mean, what happened out there? - When I looked into Ernessa's room, I could see these moths. - Yeah? Okay. - No, but thousands of them. - That's impossible. - I saw them. There were thousands of these shiny little moths, and they started throwing themselves against the glass. - I'm sorry, but you're really letting this whole Ernessa thing get to you. I think you're imagining things. - Dora, you have to believe me. There's something really weird about that room. Come out with me tonight, and I'll show you. - You're scaring me, Rebecca. - Please, look, I have to prove this to you. - Okay. Okay, I'll do it. - Okay. - Okay, ready? - Well, it's slippery. - We can feel our way along. - You almost fell last time. What's that? - Did that just happen? - I don't know. - Do you believe in the supernatural or the spirit world? - No. Those are just fairy tales. - Dora, she walked through glass. - Maybe she left her window open. - You know she didn't. - Or it was a trick of the light. - Why are you pretending you're not freaked out by this? - I am, okay? But it can't be real. There has to be a rational explanation behind this, okay? We'll talk about it in the morning. - Yeah, okay. Dora... - And you're certain you heard nothing? One of your classmates had an accident right outside your window- a fall. - I'm a very deep sleeper. Maybe you should ask one of the other girls. - The holly and the ivy When they are both full grown Of all the trees that are in the wood The holly bears the crown Oh, the rising of the sun and the running of the deer The playing of the merry organ Sweet singing in the choir The holly bears the blossom as white as a lily flower - I know it's been hard, what happened with Dora. The whole thing just seems so- do they think that she- - No. She was very happy. She had no reason. Mom, it was an accident. That's all it was. - It's okay if you don't want to go back there. - No, no. I have to go back. Mom, I can't change schools. - Okay. You know, I was thinking it would just be really great if we could get away. I called John... - Dora fell. She must have fallen. She went out there again and slipped just like I did. Ernessa didn't walk through glass. She couldn't. The window must have been open. It was dark. I won't let myself believe things I know aren't possible. Hi. - Hi. - Did you come in by train? - My mom gave me a lift. - How was your- - I got to return these to the library. - Wait. Lucy, wait, please. I'm sorry. Last term, I just- I guess I just got so jealous of you and Ernessa. I think I went a little- I don't know. Crazy. I'm sorry. - It's okay. These things happen. - No, it's not okay. It's my fault about Dora. I made her go up on the roof. - Rebecca, we all went up there. You can't beat yourself up over this. - I've just been so stupid. I-I hated being jealous. I never want to feel like that again. - I didn't want to stop being friends with you. It's just that you wouldn't give Ernessa a chance. - I've missed you so much. - I missed you too. - Let's just start over and pretend like last term never even happened. - Yeah. It feels like a bad dream anyway. - But you have to be friends with Ernessa. We were just talking about you, how we should all do something together. - Yes. Let's. - Maybe Sunday, we can all go into town or something. - We could go to the movies. - I would love that. Oh, Sunday... I booked two horses to go riding. - Oh... - Can you ride? - No. I never took lessons. - We'll have to think of something else. We'll make a plan. - We will for sure. - I'm sorry about Sunday. But we're going to spend a lot of time together very soon. We have so much in common. - "I heard a fly buzz when I died. "But the stillness in the room "was like the stillness in the air, between the heaves of storm." It's as if she's taking you moment by moment through the experience of dying. Okay, on that cheerful note, thank you very much, ladies. Uh, Rebecca? I have something to show you. It's a first edition of your father's book. You know, I have to tell you, I so admire the way your father kept writing and working all those years. - The bank? - Yes, the bank. - I think he kind of liked having a real job. - You know, I try to write at night, but there's marking papers, and there's preparation. I don't know. Sometimes I just feel my life slipping away. - You know, with my dad, it feels like all the bad stuff happened when he was able to stay home all day and write. - I will take that as my inspiration. He really is my hero, you know. - Mr. Davies? - Yes? - I need your supply list. - Of course, uh- - Thank you. - I was just showing Rebecca here this-this book. It's her father's. very rare. - Bye. - Hey, are you joining basketball? - I'm not going to do sports this term. It's too tiring. - Why are you so tired? You know, you should eat more. - I do eat. I eat all the time. - I don't see you at breakfast anymore. - I'm not hungry in the morning. - You don't seem very hungry at dinner either. - It's okay, Mom. I'm fine. - Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'll back off. Lucy? Where have you been? - I couldn't get up this morning. I slept right through the bell. - I see that Caroline Wallis and Lucy Blake were late for assembly. You will report for detention after classes. Ernessa Bloch has missed gymnastics for the fourth week in a row. She will report to Miss Bobbie to make up these classes. - Miss Bobbie makes Ernessa swim laps every day after school. It's so unfair. It's like torture for her. - Now, into the pool. Into the water. We don't have all afternoon. - Head up. Breathe. Head down. Bend your elbows. Point your toes. Breathe. - Becca. I'm meeting Chris tonight in the upper field to, uh... well, you know. - Really? - Yeah. I want you and Kiki to keep guard. Will you do it? - Yeah, of course, if you want us to. - Thank you. - You know, if it rains tonight, we're leaving. - Can you see their hovering spirits entwined through eternity? Just like a poem. - Hey, Rebecca. - So how was it? - It was kind of nothing. I feel exactly the same way I did before. And I'm sure I'm not in love with him. - Well, did you at least enjoy it? - Not really. Maybe I will after I get used to it. - Okay. - I'm just glad it's over with. I'm glad it was the first time for both of us. - What is that? - Oh, my God. - I regret to say that a terrible accident has befallen one of our teachers, Miss Bobbie. She died some time last night. Please, girls, be quiet. Assembly is not yet over. Let us turn to hymn 51. O, God, our help in ages past Our hope for years to come Our shelter from the stormy blast And our eternal home - Rebecca. My mom came in early. She won't let me come back after spring break. I shouldn't have said anything about Miss Bobbie, but I was so upset, and I don't want to leave you. - All my friends are gone. Ernessa spends all her time in Lucy's room. They always keep the door shut. Lucy's just a few feet away, but she might as well be on the other side of the world. - You look like death. - It's cramps. I feel like I'm hemorrhaging. - I haven't had my period in months. No, thanks. - How can you resist this? - Lucy, it's your favorite. - I'm going back to my room. - Okay, I have to talk to you about Ernessa. - I'm not gonna indulge you in your ridiculous obsession. I'm sorry to say this, but you're just jealous. - How can she survive without eating? - I don't want to talk about this anymore. - Wake up. Wake up! Didn't you hear the sirens? - The what? - The ambulance. They took Lucy. - What? I'll come back later. Something terrible is happening to Lucy. I'm glad she's in hospital. At least she's away from Ernessa. Hi. I brought you some chocolates and a book. - Thank you. - What's this? - Ernessa was just here. She brought that for me. I'm too tired to read. The book is so heavy. - Are you feeling any better? - It's not bad feeling so weak. I just lie here and think about breathing. - What happened to your flowers? They're all faded. - I guess they're starting to die. - I just brought them. What's Ernessa doing in the basement? We're not allowed down there. There's that same horrible smell, just like the one from her room. - Oh! - Here, let me help you. - Thank you. Stupid of me. You saved me. - Can I tell you something in confidence? - Uh, sure. - It's my friend, Lucy Blake. She hasn't been eating, and now she's in the hospital. - Why don't we talk in the car? - Yeah. There's this other girl, Ernessa Bloch. She's just a bad influence on Lucy. - What do you mean, bad influence? - She's controlling her, and Lucy just accepts it. - You think she's enabling Ernessa? - Lucy adores her, but Ernessa doesn't have her best interests at heart. I mean, Lucy's just getting sicker and weaker and thinner, and Ernessa acts like this is all good. - You're worried that she's encouraging her eating disorder. - Well, it's more than that. She's dangerous. She has some power over Lucy. - You know, cooped up here, you girls get so close. All that emotion can turn toxic. I mean, it's obvious Lucy needs help, but maybe you need to step away for a little while. Put all this emotion into your writing. Rebecca. You're a very intelligent girl. You're one of the brightest I've ever taught. You'll figure this out. Things get worse, don't be afraid to come talk to me. - Thanks. - Okay. - Is everything okay with you? - Not really. - You seem stressed. - I'm so worried about Lucy. It's been ten days, and they still won't let me see her. - Oh, she's much better. - How do you know? - I don't know. - Come on. - Okay, Ernessa told me. She visited Lucy. - When? - Um, several times last week. - They let her see Lucy? - Well, Mrs. Rood gave her permission, because she's Lucy's very special friend. - You let Ernessa see her? - I don't know what you're talking about. - You told me no visitors. Why would you let Ernessa see her? - Lucy asked to see her. Now Ernessa can't visit her either. - Well, she's my best friend. It's not fair. - Lucy has taken a turn for the worse. The doctors don't think she'll last the next few days. She's so weak. - No, l- I have to see her. I have to say good-bye. I have to. - It's out of the question. Only family members are allowed to visit. Oh! You disrespectful child! - You, me, Lucy? It would be better if we never saw each other again. I'll give her up if you just keep away from her. - Have you ever considered how much we look alike? - Miss Johnson, the nurse... - Lucy. - She would bring me all this green Jell-O. - Lucy? - Look, she's back. And she's so much better. - Doctors think I'm a miracle. - Can I talk to you about something? - Of course. - Look, I know what happened with Dora and Miss Bobbie made everybody pretty crazy. - It'll calm down. Eventually, the school will get back to normal. - No, it won't, because the person who's doing this hasn't finished yet. She still has one more victim. It's the one she came for. The others, they just got in her way. - I'm-I'm sorry? - The girl I told you about, Ernessa Bloch? - The next victim is who? - Lucy Blake. - Why are you saying this? - Because this time, Lucy won't make it to the hospital. - Rebecca, you know what you're saying can't possibly be true. - Lucy got better when the doctors banned all visitors. She got better because Ernessa couldn't get to her. Ernessa won't let that happen again. - Listen, Rebecca. I understand. This has been a difficult year for you. You're still coming to terms with what happened to your father, but you can't blame it all on Ernessa. - It is Ernessa. Why can't anyone else see that? - Rebecca. You're too young for all these morbid thoughts. - Lucy? I know you're getting sick again. I'm worried. I need to call your mom. - I'm not sick. Really, I'm not sick. It's something else. - Don't you want your mom to come get you? - No, you can't call her. She'd come right away, in the middle of the night. - Lucy, I just don't understand why you won't let me help. - That's because you just want to believe that I'm still the old Lucy. It's sad. You don't care about the new me, the real Lucy. You don't even want to know her. - This is all Ernessa's fault. She's turned you against me. That's why you're saying this. - Why do you want to blame her for everything? - Because she is to blame for everything. - No, no. - If she hadn't come here this year, we would have had a great year. Don't you see she's ruined everything for me? God, I hate her so much. I'd kill her if I had the chance. - Don't talk like that. It's sick. - Look at yourself. Tell me you don't look sick. You can barely stand up. - Look at yourself. Just leave me alone, please. I can't stand having you around me all the time, wanting me only for yourself. You're a fucking drag. You pull me down with all your pain. - You never said anything. I'll never speak to her again. Never. Lucy? Lucy! Lucy! Lucy. Oh, Lucy, Lucy. What happened? Lucy. Lucy, don't leave me. Please don't leave me. Lucy, please! Please don't leave me, please! Please! - I know how hard Lucy's death must have been for you. Thank you for coming to see me, Rebecca. - The school made me. - They're concerned about you. They think you have some unresolved feelings about your father. Can you tell me a little about his death? - He slit his wrists. Both of them. - Did you see him? - I was kept away. - Let's talk about the conversation you had the other day with Mr. Davies. You don't really believe what you said about that other girl, do you? - Mr. Davies talked to you? He told you what I said? - He talked to Miss Rood. Obviously, he was concerned. - Wordsworth's lyrical ballads. Anybody heard of them? Dad? Daddy? - Books won't save you. Your writing won't save you. The past won't save you. Mr. Davies won't save you. Daddy can't save you. - My father wanted to save me. He loved me. I know he did. - He's the one who caused you all this trouble in the first place. - You're wrong. The good things I remember about my father, the walks we took, the fairy tales he read to me, they all really happened. - He read you other fairy tales that you forgot. My mother, she butchered me My father, he ate me My sister, little Anne-Marie She gathered up the bones of me And tied them in a silken cloth To lay under the juniper Tweet, tweet What a pretty bird am I It's time to free yourself. - September 5th, 1907. Tea on the lawn at the Brangwyn Hotel. We had picnics and played croquet. My mother recovered, but I never did. I kept my face composed, but inside, my thoughts screamed. My father's voice kept calling to me, "There's nothing for you here." One day, I filled the bath with warm water. It was less painful there. By the time the water turned red, I could no longer see. - Ernessa died here, and she wants me to die here too. I'm the one she came for. It was me all along. - Get another ladder over here! Let's get another unit around the back. Check for hot spots. - Rebecca. You'd better come with me. Your mother is waiting for you at the police station. They need to ask you some questions. - They're suspicious of me, but I'm not afraid. They will find the ashes of her trunk in the basement, but they won't find a body. Ernessa's gone, and she's not coming back. I set us both free. Can you open the window just a little? - Sure. - One-track mind like a goldfish Stuck inside my Petri dish I can't breathe, and I can't smile This better be worth my while I feel numb most of the time The lower I get, the higher I'll climb And I will wonder why I got dark only to shine Looking for the golden light Oh, it's a reasonable sacrifice Burn, burn, burn bright Burn, burn, burn bright Forgo family, forgo friends That's how it started, how it ends I can't open up and cry 'Cause I've been silent all my life I feel numb most of the time The lower I get, the higher I'll climb And I will wonder why I got dark only to shine Looking for the golden light Oh, it's a reasonable sacrifice Shine Looking for the golden light Oh, it's a reasonable sacrifice Sacrifice I feel numb most of the time The lower I get, the higher I'll climb And I will wonder why I got dark only to shine And I'll light up the sky Stars that burn the brightest Fall so fast and pass you by Puff like empty lighters Shine, and I'll light up the sky Stars that burn the brightest Fall so fast and pass you by Spark like empty lighters Dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum Dum, da-dum, da-dum Dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum Dum, da-dum, da-dum
