Hey, watch your back. - You watch your back. - Yeah, baby. - Check it out. - All right. Clear. This is not the right shoe. - Hi, Chelsea. - Hi, Paul. Thank you. I'm so happy to see you all and to welcome you to my tenth annual spring line collection. I'm proud to announce that 50 per cent of the proceeds from tonight's show will go to the New York Save the Children's Foundation. Now, fasten your seat belts and on with the show. Mr. O'Shea. Hey! Chicki. Come here. Say "shit". - Shit. - There you go. - Sal, take Chicki down to the factory. - Tommy. - Don't let Big Al leave till I see him. - Whatever you say. Let's go, Chicki. - Hey, stronz'. Come on, let's go. - What? - I love it, but you should be ready. - There she is. Tommy, you shouldn't be here. It's bad for my company. Maxine. Wait for me in the limo. Max! You. Wait. Limo. "Your" company. That's "our" problem. These numbers are very bad, Albert. You're way behind. - What can I do? - Pray. How many times do I have to tell you about that? Jesus! I'll tell you what you do. Tell Tommy you made a mistake, you can fix it. I hate to see you get hurt. You're already fat, ugly and stupid. You don't need any more problems. Am I right? Am I fucking right? What are you, fucking deaf? Am I right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Thank you. I don't need this fucking shit. - I see Chelsea's here. - This is not the time. That's my daughter, sitting with a geek. She's not your daughter any more. A judge took her away from you, remember? I never forget... ...love. What's the matter with you? Do you believe this guy? This is pathetic. Albert. Big, fat Albert. How're you doing, Al? - Mr. O'Shea, there's no need... - What do you mean? I always have need. - Say something, stutter. - I can't play with the numbers any more. - We're gonna have a problem. - I see, you don't understand. Clean that goddamn wax out of your ears. - We have to make the dirty cash clean, OK? - But we're moving more cash than clothes. Really? - Congratulations. - Hello, darling. Where's Chelsea? Glued to her seat. She's going to take after you. - You're going to miss the best part. - The best part is here. What's the matter? - How did this happen? - Chelsea's father's here. - He did this to you? - It's a way of life for him. Where is he? - Olivia, where is he? - He's downstairs in the factory. Come on. - Come on, move your ass, Albert. - Mr. O'Shea... There she is, the enchanting Esther Williams. Show us your best stroke, Esther! - How much, ballpark? - Mr. O'Shea, please. - No, give me a number. - Come on. That was 1,500 dollars' worth of merchandise. 1,500? Chicki, grab a handful of high fashion there. Eveningwear. You're the greatest, Tommy. And you're stupid. More clothes than cash. Solve your problem? With all due respect, Mr. O'Shea, I follow Miss Regent's instructions. Oh! Reg! You and me are gonna take a little walk around the woodshed. Mr. O'Shea, please. - Mr. O'Shea, Mr. O'Shea. - That's my name. - Mr. O'Shea... - You're repeating yourself. - Is this necessary? - You're boring the shit out of me. You know what your problem is? What? You and your boss think you don't have to service your partners any more. I'm partnered up with over 35 companies, all of whom are very responsive and helpful, with the exception of this company because it's too fat. And you, you're too fat. Look at you. You look like a beached whale. - Mr. O'Shea. - Albert. I warned you. You wouldn't listen. - Whoa! - Look what we have here. I'm just acting, Albert. Relax. But in all seriousness... - My god! - That's gross. Big tub of guts. I think you ought to have Dr. O'Shea's one-second weight loss. - Don't move, fat man. - I think Al's got the message, don't you? Tommy. - This is bullshit! And so are you. - My head nigger and you talk to me like that? - Fuck you, son of a bitch! - Hey! Reg, that was really stupid. - You got a big mouth. Now apologize. - I ain't saying shit. Now, Reggie, you know if you don't say shit, you'll lose 90 per cent of your vocabulary. You people just never learn, do you? There you go, Sambo. Take the wounded bear and dance outta here. - I ain't taking this shit any more. - Reg, take your problem up with the NWACP. - I think he's gonna cause trouble, Tommy. - Trouble breeds trouble. - What is this? - Paul. Tommy. - Is this him? - You got a problem? - Do guns make you nervous? - Guns have their uses. Idiots with guns make me nervous. Put it away. Well, there she is. How's my little girl? Accident. 3,000 dollar suit. Can't take me... anywhere. - It's gonna be one of those days. - What? I was just saying to Chicki it's a nice day. - Think about it, Reg. Tommy'll kill you. - Screw Tommy, man. Tommy won't like it. I couldn't keep him out, Paul. He saw an opportunity and he just pounced. The unions, trucking, he's infiltrated every aspect of my business... - Mommy! Come over here! ... and almost all the garment district. I could tell you a lot more. - You've told me enough. The DA's a friend. - Look. Oh! - Paul. Nice to see you again. - Brian. Nice to see you. Come in. This is my assistant, Hector Vasquez. Hector, meet Paul Kersey. Nice to meet you. - Stewart. Professor Paul Stewart. - Right. I should have remembered. I gave you that name. No, it wasn't you. It was your boss when you were working with the witness protection programme. - The new life we gave you working out? - Yeah. Still teaching architecture. - So life's good? - Depends. - On what? - On you. Ah, yes. You said on the phone that a friend needs my help? - Olivia Regent. - The fashion designer? - Wasn't she married to? - Tommy O'Shea. You see, O'Shea has involved himself in her business, in the whole fashion world, in fact, in a very bad way. - She would like to get him out. - Maybe we can help each other. I haven't been able to touch that guy. When can she come in? - Tomorrow? - Perfect. Tommy O'Shea. - I hope she realizes her whole life will change. - She hopes it's for the better. Oh! I bet it's beautiful. Oh! It is. Paul, I can't tell you what this means to me. And Chelsea, she so needs a father. - Can I take that to mean a yes? - Come here. With all my heart. To us. Oh! Oh! I'll be right back. I've always been a fan of yours, Miss Regent. - Are you embarrassed or something? - I'm not embarrassed. Ah, jeez! Come on, what happened here? - OK, sweetheart, don't worry about it. - Are you OK? - Bring some more of these, will you? - Get him a towel. There, that's better. Goddamn dandruff! Oh! I'm sorry. It's true, isn't it? Look at that. What a face you've got. Look at it. Not me, you. Look at that beautiful face! Take a good look at it because I'm going to have to take it away from you. See, why do you? It's best to be careful who you talk to. We have ears everywhere. We know what you're thinking of doing. Don't do it. It's a bad idea. So bad. So bad! Come here, baby. The next time, your daughter won't have a mother. Remember. Excuse me. She's stable, fair. - Tough gal. - On the outside. I'm not gonna pull any punches. Even with reconstruction, the face will never be the same. Why was O'Shea at the restaurant? It's more than coincidence. How did he know she was going to testify? Paul, I didn't know she would need protection until after she came in. I should have known. I underestimated O'Shea. It's not gonna happen again. It's not your fault. She'll still talk to us, won't she? - I don't know. - Paul... This thing is not just gonna go away. Let me just have a couple of words, all right? Hoyle. Vasquez. My investigation started an hour ago and the chief prosecutor's already here? Olivia Regent, the victim, is part of an ongoing investigation in my department, Lieutenant. - The Tommy O'Shea investigation? - What do you know about that? He was at the scene of the crime and wherever he is, he stinks. I watched him come up through the Irish gangs. Now he's going big time. He's a scumbag. But we believe the perp might have been somebody else. Do you recognize him? He had a lot of make-up on. I don't know. - May I, sir? - Do you know him, Vasquez? - Looks like Frederick Garretty. - Aka Freddie Flakes. He's got a skin condition. It causes bad dandruff. When O'Shea has a special job to do, he uses this piece of scum. Likes disguises, a security freak. A very lethal guy. What about Tommy O'Shea? He's the guilty one. Paul, unless I have something more to go on, my hands are tied. O'Shea has an ironclad alibi, right? You were there. I see I'm wasting my time with you guys. I got some more questions. I'll be calling you. Still not sure what you're doing here. Well, it's a little over your head, Lieutenant. Why don't you just do your job, I'll do mine. OK? Excuse me. Lieutenant. I remember when he was fixing parking tickets in the DA's office. Let's get outta here. - How's Chelsea? - Don't worry, Professor. She sleeps upstairs. - How'd this happen? - Chelsea's father's here. - He did this to you? - It's a way of life for him. - I could tell you a lot more. - You've told me enough. I couldn't keep him out. He saw an opportunity and he pounced. The unions, trucking, he has infiltrated every aspect of my business and most everyone else in the garment district. Tommy O'Shea. I hope she realizes her whole life will change. - She hopes it's for the better. - I'm not pulling any punches. Even with reconstruction, the face will never be the same. You got a problem? - Guns make you nervous? - Guns have their uses. Idiots with guns make me nervous. Little Reggie's been telling tales and talking out of school. Now who's Reggie been talking to? - I said nothing to nobody, you white trash. - I had no idea you were so prejudiced. I usually get a shine with that. Do what you want with him. - There you go saying stupid things again. - Hey, Sal. You're looking a little rumpled. What do you say we straighten you out? - It's not a good thing. - It'll improve your appearance. No! No! Aagh! Reg, we know you've been talking to somebody. Why don't you just tell us who? - I ain't said nothing to nobody. - He ain't said nothing to nobody. - I bet that smarts, eh? Reg? Reg? - What? - Why did you do it? Don't lie! - I said nothing. You're lying! Let's straighten his hair. Come on. Let's straighten his hair. Yeah, that's better. Well, Reg, now you're all straightened out. Say goodnight. Chicki, we'll meet you and Reg down in the car. Get up. Get up. Goodnight, Reg. - OK, is that it? - Yeah, here it is. Looks like a pen, doesn't it? When we get this new recorded evidence, we're gonna nail O'Shea. - Albert, be very careful. - Don't worry. - We are gonna get those bastards, right? - You're damn right. You know how to use this? We make a hole in your shirt there... Clear, let's go. - This goombah won't pay for protection. - Let's have some fun. - Get out! Get out of here! - Cash! There you go! Next time Tommy says pay, you pay or we play. What about the laundry shipment coming this afternoon? Laundry? Oh, you mean the clothes for the homeless shelter? - What? - You know, people without homes. You forgot? You don't care about people less fortunate than you? Disgusting. I'm gonna strike you from my Christmas list. Mind if I borrow your pen? Thanks, Albert. Goodbye, Albert. They made him. Bitch! Police! Out of my way! Stop! Police! - Going down to the morgue. - Massive internal injuries. Sorry, guys, that's all we could do. - Well, how is she? - She's gone. Why were you there, anyway? You're not going back to your old ways? - Is that such a bad idea? - Let the cops take these guys down. - You know, sometimes the law works. - And sometimes it doesn't. These people steal, murder, destroy people's lives, and get away with it. They have alibis, money, lawyers, power. They have everything. Tell me something. How long have you been trying to take these guys down? 16 years. These guys are pros. It's not like it's some gang of doped-out muggers. 16 years? It's a long time to be failing. - I gotta go. Bye. - Ciao. Mama, relax. It's a sidewalk. Mama, who's the best, uh? Paul, I don't want Chelsea to see me like this. Chelsea's still at my place. - I thought it best until things settle down. - Thank you. Look at my face, Paul. Look at my face. I can't let Tommy get away with this. I won't let him. Olivia, you don't know how hard it is for me to say this. Let the law deal with Tommy. OK. Whatever you say. First I have to make a telephone call. I think Hoyle's phone has been bugged. So go along with me on this, will you? - District Attorney Hoyle's office. - Attorney Hoyle, please. - Who's calling? - Paul Stewart. - Hoyle. - It's Paul. How's Olivia? She hasn't changed... Olivia has decided not to testify. - Paul. - Can I talk to you about this for a minute? She's made up her mind and I support her decision. I'm sorry. All right. All right. Shit. Somebody else was listening. Hey! Tommy's really pissed, Gail. - It's payday, Gail. Where is it? - I don't have any money. - Where is it? - In the car. Come on, let's see what we got. Is the money in here? Oh, look at this! Look at this! What's this? Get outta my way! - I'm outta here. - You're losing weight. Stay for dinner. - Hector, you're staying for dinner. - You are. - Can I see your gun? - No. What's the matter with you? He's staying for dinner, first 'cause it's free and second, look how lonely he is. And I'm hungry. OK, I'll stay. Wait. You're not trying to set me up like last time? - Would I do that? - Yes, you would, actually. - Did you? - No, really. I have no idea who it is. - I have nothing to do with it. - Is it Marilyn? - She's got a moustache like you. - Hector, I do have a friend, a great girl. She just came in from out of town. I'd like you to meet her. Paul! Come on in. - What are you doing here? - I came to tell you Olivia will testify. Why didn't you say on the phone? I think somebodys listening in to your conversations. Jesus Christ. OK. I understand. I'm not making the same mistake twice. I'll send Agent McDonald to her place for security. - OK? Come on in. - No, I've gotta get back to Olivia. She's doing the right thing, Paul. Hector, she is gonna testify. Tell McDonald to get over to her place now. Sorry, I gotta make some calls. Tell me, Paul. What do you see? I see the woman I'm going to marry. Promise me if anything should happen to me... - Nothing's gonna happen. - No, promise me still. - You'll take care of Chelsea. - Of course, I promise. I love you. And I love you. Yes? Dwight McDonald, Justice Department. Professor Stewart, we'd like to secure the building, sir. Professor Stewart? Olivia! How rude! - Olivia! - Paul? Olivia! Get away quickly. Use the fire escape. Quick! Gentlemen. - There he is! - We're here! Onward. - Where the hell is he? - He's not gonna get away. - Bingo. - There he is! - I'll get him. - Check the other rooms. - That bitch is gonna die. - Chicki, get that one. - Where is she? - Not in there. She's gotta be up there. Chicki, let's go. Peekaboo. She's gotta be up there. Son of a bitch! Come on, Chicki, let's go! Chicki! Go help your brother. I'll take care of her. Oh! Olivia! Ha! Better. Let's get outta here! OK. Check that side. Check the alley. Check the alley. Move! Go! Tommy O'Shea was released after questioning in the murder of Olivia Regent. Mr. O'Shea, what are your plans? I don't know. Might go fishing. I need a vacation. Seriously? Seriously, my life's a goddamn soap opera. Tune in tomorrow. Lieutenant King, why did the Organized Crime Bureau call in Mr. O'Shea? There is nothing unusual about this. We always talk to ex-spouses of murder victims. - Yes, but don't you? - Thank you, that's all we have to say. Look... Wait for me in the car. I'd better do this by myself. - Hi, Paul. - Say what you came to say. Chelsea, I'm so sorry about your mom. Paul, can... we talk? - Every time I talk to you, somebody gets hurt. - Listen to me. You come before the grand jury and identify those guys who... One of those guys will give Tommy up in a deal. I'll airtight the case with other people, not just you. Brian, get your men together and leave. Take your team back to headquarters. I miss mom. I wish she were here. Uh-huh. Uh-huh! Got you. You do good work, councilor. Well, boys. Tomorrow's the big day. - Big day? What big day? - Baby's coming home to dada. - Is your daughter coming for a visit? - What? - Your daughter, she's coming for a visit? - No, she's coming here to live. Permanently. Gee, baby. I never knew you felt that way about her. - What's mine is mine. - What did you say? I don't know. I'm starting to mumble like you, so I couldn't hear. What? Chelsea, don't forget your gloves and your hat. - I don't wanna go. I wanna stay with you. - What's happening? What's going on? - Into the car, miss. - What is this? I'm sorry, Professor Stewart. He has the legal rights. I apologize, sir. Read it and weep. She's coming with me. Like hell she is. Son of a bitch is quick. Professor Stewart! Are you all right? What's happened? Professor, what's happened? What is it? Look at my face, Paul. I can't let Tommy get away with this. Paul, if you'll just come before the grand jury, identify those men... Gather your men together and leave. - Going back to your old ways? - Is that a bad idea? - Let the law do it. Sometimes it works. - Sometimes it doesn't. These people steal, murder, destroy people's lives, and get away with it. - Our hands are tied. - I'm wasting my time with you guys. - That looks perfect. - Grazie, - Hey, sis. How you doing? - OK. - Hey, Sal, I gotta take a whiz. - He's gotta take a whiz. - Where's mama? - She's in the back. Chicki, your canoli's on the table up front. I'll see Mama later. I'll see Chicki at Tommy's. - You drive careful, Salvatore. - Yeah, yeah. Congratulations, you finally got a customer. - Can I have a refill of coffee, please? - Sure. - Hey, buddy, finished with the papers? - Help yourself. - There you go. - Thanks. Anna, I love your canoli! Chicki, you eat too many, you're gonna turn into a blimp. I'll be a happy blimp. Chicki, are you OK? Chicki, are you OK? Chicki! Chicki, what's wrong? Chicki! Chicki! Help him, mister. Help him, come on! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Help! My brother! Help! Have you got a problem? - Chicki! - All right, lady. All right. Father, God of all consolation, in your unending love and mercy for us, you turn the darkness of death into the dawn of new life. Show compassion to your people in their sorrows. Be our refuge and our strength to lift us from the darkness of this grief... Come on. It's OK. Your son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by dying for us, conquered death. - We'll stand by you. - He treated me like shit. Why do I miss him? - She's not holding up too well. - I sure wouldn't want that to be me. ...where every tear will be wiped away. We ask this through Christ our Lord, Amen. - Cyanide. Who would've? - I haven't a clue. Everybody's going to ball games together. It doesn't make any sense. Chicki. He had no concept of security. He was, like, naked. You should learn from this. Sure, become a paranoid schizophrenic like you. You got it wrong, Tommy. Protection is like being back in your mother's womb, it's so safe. - Hey. - Dandruff. - What? - What happened? I have no idea. Oh, my God. Look at that. Oh, my Lord. Tommy really knows how to buy. This is quality merchandise. This stuff is gonna sell. Way better than what that broad had. You're right, Sal. Tommy's a genius. Yeah. Can somebody help me back here? Maxine. Max! - Slither over my way. - What, baby? It's show time. - Something wrong? - Just keep at it. Nothing's happening again. Any shit outta you, I'll squeeze your head. Take a hike. Turn around. Are you ticklish? When you talk to your mother do you do this? What do we have here? - Put it down. - Yes, sir. Happy? - Mr. Vasquez. - Mr. O'Shea. I never thanked you personally for that tip on Olivia. That's OK. The money was your thanks. Who killed Chick? Well, you got a problem. Ever hear the name Paul Kersey, a vigilante killer a few years back? Oh, yeah. That was your ex-wife's boyfriend. Professor. - You people have him? - Not any more. - He did Chicki? - Kersey's no amateur. You pissed him off. - How do we find him? - I could remedy that situation. - But it's gonna cost you. - No kidding? - Have at it. - Deal. You know... Kersey's gonna be going down the list. Get it? - Hey, Hector. - Yeah? Something you're wearing? I don't know, Tommy. Check Sal. Scumbag. - Jesus Christ. - What? - We gotta call Freddie. - Don't worry about Freddie. You know Freddie. He's in the womb. What? The womb. Hm. Birthday present? - A treat for someone special. - How lovely. Won't they be surprised? You look great in that outfit. Do you think it'll fit me? That depends. Are you into pain? - This is the only place I feel safe any more. - Want some wine? You go ahead. I gotta keep my head clear. Of course the stress is making me itch. - Sure you don't want some wine? - Yeah. - Maybe milk, to calm me down. - No, milk's bad for dandruff. - Really? - Yeah. I gotta get a new dermatologist. That guy's a joke. - I'll give you some buttons to push. - Yeah. - I just gotta calm down, you know. - Oh, lighten up. You sound like Tommy. Tommy's being stupid and careless. He thinks he's got some guns, some goons, he's safe. I'm worried about him. He used to be smarter than that. What happens if Tommy goes down? Will he be loyal to me? This stuff is supposed to kill every flake on my head. - It smells like the stuff they use on cockroaches. - Who are you calling a cockroach? Hey! Stay put. I'll be right back. Oh, God. Kids. Hey, Freddie! I'm gonna take care of your dandruff problem for you. No! Freddie! Aagh! Aagh! No! Freddie! - Brian. - Yeah? - I got some news. - I don't want any more news. Sorry, I just got off the phone with the mayor's assistant. - The mayor's on a rampage about this vigilante. - I'm not surprised. - He's gonna call in a few minutes. - The assistant? No, the mayor. First Paconi, then Flakes. He's going down the list. Make sure O'Shea's covered. You got it. - You wanna get that? - That's why they pay you the big bucks. Hoyle. - It's Paul, Brian. - Where are you? We've looked all over for you. You can't take the law into your own hands. Let me help you. You can help me by meeting me at Olivia's house at 10. Come alone, will you? Paul? Honey, I gotta get off the phone. I didn't think it would be this easy, Kersey. Neither did I. You're right. You can't trust the justice system. He would have killed you, Brian. Yeah. No judge, no jury... ...no appeal and no deals. How do you feel about it? I'm scared. What are you gonna do? Paul... ...Im not even here. Let us pray. Lord, hear our prayers and be merciful to your son whom you have called from this life. Welcome him into the company of your saints... - Terrible. ... in the kingdom of light and peace... But life goes on... Father, God of all consolation, in your unending love and mercy for us... My children, please. This is the house of the Lord. Put away those weapons. My children, please. Let us continue. Show compassion to your people in their sorrow... What is it? ...to lift us from the darkness of this grief... It's the asshole. Your son, our Lord, Jesus Christ... Where are you going, my children? - Tommy. - What? Over there. Well, open the goddamn thing, dummy. You know, it's the first time I've ever looked at that son of a bitch and it didn't irritate me. Ship him to Jersey. Max. A couple of cappuccinos and something to eat. Then upstairs and check out Chelsea. This is no good, Tommy. This is a vendetta that we brought on ourselves. Now Vasquez is gone, that's terrific. - This is bad for business. - Vasquez got what he deserved. We can always buy somebody else. Just concentrate on Kersey. Concentrate on Kersey. Concentrate on Kersey. We got every spare soldier out looking for that maniac. Jesus Christ, Tommy! I want out. As soon as we dust this Kersey asshole, I want out. - That's it. - What is it, Sallie? What do you mean? Look at me! My blood pressure's going through the goddamn roof. Ever since Chicki's gone, it don't make sense any more. Your blood pressure, part of it's your diet. You eat like you're going to the electric chair. I don't need you to tell me how to eat. Concentrate on Kersey. I think we oughta give the lamb to the wolf. - We'll catch Kersey using Chelsea as bait. - What are you talking about? Lamb, wolf? Kersey, he knows every move we're making, and somebody's helping him out. You're the lamb, Sallie. - Are you selling me out? No! - No, listen to me. Do the same thing you do every Sunday, go to church, drop the cash at Olivia's, do everything like on Sunday. Sure, and get barbecued like Freddie Flakes. He won't get near you, I promise. You promise. You promise. So I pick Chelsea up here and Kersey's gonna do nothing? No, you lead him to the factory and right into the trap. Don't they look nice? There she is. Poor, sweet, dim-witted Max. - Our resident retard. - What? Chicki choked to death on a canoli. Do you not remember? If you had a brain, you would play with it! - Don't! - Moron! Hello, Tommy? I got Kersey on my tail. I'm going to pick up Chelsea. Hi, sweetheart. Tommy? Yeah, I got Chelsea. Get everybody ready. We're on our way. Angel, check out the toys. Let's rock and roll! All right. Rock and roll your butts downstairs. And give Mr. Kersey the warmest of welcomes. Let's do it. Come on. Stay there. Now, come on. Let's go. Hey, hey! Get in there! You guys in position? Kersey should be showing up any time. - Kersey won't know what hit him. - Make him suffer. He's right behind me, the asshole. He's walking right into it. Wonderful. Chelsea. Chelsea, come here. You'd better come over here, you stubborn little shit. - No. - Hey, do what your father tells you. You spoilt little brat. He's inside. Shit! He's history. Shit. Aagh! - Where's the girl? - Don't know. Frankie? Frankie? Mickey. Mickey? Son of a bitch. Angel? - How many more of you are there? - I don't know. Angel! Frankie! Get up there. Get up there! I'll take the walkie-talkie. - What are you gonna do? - Help you remember. Hold that. Hold it! Come on, Kersey. What's this all about? I don't know nothing. Come on. Come on, Kersey. Memory any better? - Where's the girl? - She's upstairs in the big room. - Anybody with her? - Sal and Tommy. Sh! Frankie. Where've you been? How've you been doing? Did you get Kersey? Answer me! I'm coming for you, O'Shea. - Paul! Paul! - Don't just stand there, for Christ's sake! Moron. Sal! - Sal! - What? Tommy, the kid's getting away. You go that way. I'll meet you in the showroom. Paul? Paul, are you here? Paul? Don't even think it. - Paul! Help me! - Stop! Dammit! Paul! Paul, where are you? Sal! Sal! Jesus! Sal! Kersey! Shit! Kersey, I'm unarmed. I have no gun, right? You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man, would you? Kersey? Paul! Please, help me! Paul! Paul! Paul, help me! - Hey! - Paul? Paul, where are you? Aagh! How does that feel, you son of a bitch? Bastard! - Are you all right? Where's Paul? - He's upstairs with Tommy. Guns make you nervous? Do you want me to beg, you son of a bitch? Please. Please. No! - Freeze, scumbag! - Frozen. Wait! Listen. Whatever you want, whatever you need. I don't need anything. But you, you need a bath. No! - You OK? - Yeah, I think so. - What are you going to do about me? - Don't worry. I'll take care of it. The girl's outside. She's safe. Thanks, Lieutenant. Hey, Lieutenant, if you need any help, give me a call. SkyFury
