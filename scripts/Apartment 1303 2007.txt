It must be hard. Is the funeral over? Yeah, it just finished. Grandma's safely on her way to heaven. I'm heading straight to your place, still in my funeral suit! Okay. I'll be waiting. BLUE PALACE HIRAOKA Good evening. What? What's the matter? Hey! Yuka! What are you doing?! Don't! - No! Help! - Don't! Yuka! We're here! Wow! What a great building! Hey, there's a pool! Great! THE MOVING SCHEDULE Don't! Stop it! Kenichiro! Play this song next. - Let's have a barbecue on the beach! - A barbecue! That's a great idea! Yeah! A barbecue. Hello? Oh, sis! Yeah, that's right. What? I'm fine. Big sister's checking up on her. How's Mom? She is? Look after her, sis, okay? Oh, sis. I love you! See you. Sayaka. What did Mariko have to say? Not to go too crazy when I've just moved in. My sister is such a drag! Maybe she's jealous that her little sister's moved into a place as nice as this. She's going to be living alone with your mother, isn't she? Yeah. But you know, isn't it weird that the rent for a great place like this is so cheap? - It is weird! We could pay double. - I agree. - Sayaka, are you sure this is okay? - What do you mean, "Okay"? This is what she means. Uh-oh. You're not mad, are you? Sorry. It was a bad joke. No. Ouch! As a matter of fact, that's exactly what it is. What do you mean, that's what it is? They say this building is famous... for ghosts. Ghosts?! That's right. It's, like, they say there's a woman with long hair in a kimono who stands in the elevator hall... then when anyone comes up in front of the elevator... the woman in the kimono says this... Is this the 13th floor? - And then when you say... - Yes, this is the 13th floor. And you're about to get on the elevator, suddenly... and then she says this... "Give me back my eyes." What? What does she say? What does she say? My eyes... My eyes... give them back! I got you! Yo, you're the most scared of them all. So went the story that was on TV the other night. Ta-da! Wha-aat?! You sure had me going! Anyway, it's got a great view, but it's a long way from the train station and there aren't many buses on this route, so there's hardly anyone who wants to rent this place, is what the real-estate agent said. Kenichiro, change the music, will you? That one scares me! Yo was more scared than anyone. Get it together, dude! Yeah, you're a disgrace, Yo. Huh? Where's Samantha? Yeah, I thought she went to the bathroom, but she hasn't come back, has she? Samantha? Samantha? Samantha? Samantha, what are you doing in here? What's the matter, Samantha? Hey, Sayaka, don't you smell something weird? Yeah, I do. What a stink! Come on, time to eat. Food! - Where was she? - The tatami room. - Where's Sayaka? - Over there. Sayaka, what are you doing? Sayaka, cut it out, will you? Hey... Sayaka? What's the matter with you? Sayaka? Sayaka? What are you doing? Well, I don't want my face to get all smashed up, you know. What? Hey, Sayaka... Sayaka! Another one fell, huh? This must be hard for you too, lwata. I'm sorry you've been put through all this. It must have been a real shock to all of you. It happened right in front of you, after all. - It wasn't suicide. - What? Sayaka commit suicide? Lt'd never happen! Sayaka would never... she'd never kill herself. Don't! Sayaka was looking at me. While she was falling... she was looking straight at me. The poor girl... Sayaka! Sis... Mom pushed me. Mother, how long is this going to go on? Mother! Snap out of it, will you? Sayaka... - What? - Mariko, you're always like this. Aren't you sad that Sayaka's dead? What are you talking about? What a horrible thing to say! Of course I'm sad! Why did it have to be her? Why did it have to be her? Why her? Why isn't she here?! Come on, Mother, please! Come on, please. Well, you'd better get going. You don't want to keep everyone waiting. Thanks. Sayaka, phone as soon as you get there. Yeah. Okay then, bye. Sayaka... why would you do a stupid thing like that? You didn't smoke, did you? That's a cute teddy bear. It was the big sister's from next door. THE MOVING SCHEDULE Here. - What's this? - A moving schedule. Follow it and you'll get everything done faster. That's one thing I'll say about you, sis, you really handle details well. You'll make some man a fine wife someday. Oh, damn. Sis, I'm going to cry! Oh, come on! What are you talking about? You don't have time for crying. Ow! Did she have earrings like this? UNKNOWN CALLER Ken! The real-estate office just called! I got the apartment. They said the person ahead of me had come in and canceled. It's hard to believe, but I'm really lucky! Canceled? I just signed the contract. What am I going to do? I'll be living alone for the first time. I found teddy! The poor thing was stuck away in the closet. I've decided we're going to live together! But that's... Hello. Your mother's out? Is that so? Do you know about what time she might be home? You're taking care of the place all alone till then? That's very brave. You said the big sister in the next apartment gave you that teddy bear, didn't you? Do you remember when? Aren't you scared? Sorry? Aren't you scared of that apartment? Why? All the women next door died, you know. Why? Yeah, I'll stay here cleaning up her stuff tonight. I have to be here tomorrow when they come to take out the furniture. Well, yeah, but I'm tired, too. Mother, stop just thinking of yourself all the time, will you? Oh, the police gave me her phone back. They said they didn't need it anymore. Yes, they're calling it a suicide. Okay, bye. You get some sleep, all right? Sayaka! Sayaka, is there something you want to tell me? Sayaka... The Kanto region was shaken by an earthquake at around 2:40 a.m. The epicenter was below Tokyo Bay, and it had a magnitude of 4.6 on the Richter scale. An earthquake? On the Japanese scale, it registered four in western Kanagawa Prefecture. Is that all? That looks fine. I'll take the key then. Thank you. Um... Yes? Is there anything else? No. Sorry to trouble you. This wasn't my sister's. Could I ask you to take it away for me? Take good care of the teddy bear, will you? My little sister treasured it. The big sister who gave me this is still next door, you know. What do you mean? Detective Seiichi Sakurai The Kanagawa Prefecture Police Blue Palace Hiraoka Serial Suicides Autopsy Report July 18th: Midorigawa Sayaka, 21, jumped from balcony, suicide Last year, September 21st: Kawabara Yuka, 21, jumped from balcony, suicide Last year, February 15th: Masuda Sanae, 24, committed suicide by jumping from balcony Two years ago, November 30th Endo Michiru, 26, committed suicide by jumping from balcony Two years ago, May 15th: Sugiuchi Yukiyo, 29, committed suicide. So your sister is the fifth? This might take a while to explain. Do you have time? Profiling a bizarre murderer: Hatred of a too tightly organized society Mother's Decomposed Body Left in Apartment of Woman Suicide Mother's body found in woman's home Mummified Mummy! The tragic tale of a mother and daughter in a seaside condo Daughter jumps to death from thirteenth floor Did this mother and daughter live in that apartment? That's correct. After Sugiuchi Yukiyo died, the body of her mother, Sugiuchi Sachiko, was found in a closet in the tatami room. The body had been there for six months since the woman had died. In the closet? The story's a real tragedy. Several books came out about it afterwards. It would appear that Yukiyo had always been abused by her mother. She wasn't a heavy-on-the-makeup kind of woman. She was very quiet, and her clothes were real drab. As soon as work was done, she'd head straight home. It was like she didn't want to mix with people very much. She'd never come to company parties or events. I never knew she was looking after her mother or anything. Her mother always made her a lunch, and she'd go out on the roof and eat alone. I don't think she had, like, a friend or anyone like that. A boyfriend? I really doubt that. But suddenly she surprised everyone by saying she was going to get her ears pierced. I remember how happy she seemed then. After she separated from her husband, Sugiuchi Sachiko apparently lived a pretty wild life. The mother seems to have been an alcoholic. When she was drunk, there was no stopping her, and in the end she had gone completely crazy. She abused her daughter Yukiyo her whole life. Even made her eat dog food, it would seem. That's horrible. Including the mother, Sugiuchi Sachiko, six people have died in Unit 1303. That's in only three years. It's too many people to clear it all away under coincidence. Miss Midorigawa, do you think there's any chance your younger sister committed suicide? No. Definitely not. Of course not. Any way you look at it, it's not natural that any of the women who died here would have committed suicide. But that's what the police have called it. There's absolutely no evidence of a mishap or foul play. As far as the police are concerned, there's no other conclusion to draw but suicide. I found this in my sister's apartment, but I don't think it's hers. You can have it. Fine. MIDORIGAWA I'm back. Mother? Mother! What are you doing?! Mariko, give Sayaka back. Mother! Stop it! Let go! She's all alone in that room, she says. It hurts, she says. It's raining and she's cold, she says. I got some blankets ready. You've got to go out there. You've got to go out there for her! Mother, please! Stop this! Sayaka! Sayaka! Mother, Sayaka's not here anymore. - She's dead. - No! Give Sayaka back! Mother... I'm still here. Why won't you see me? I'm just as hurt as you are. We can weep and wail all we want, but it still won't bring Sayaka back. You've always been that way. What? Always blaming me, always critical... that's why I hate you. Why? Why would you say such a thing? That's awful! That's awful, Mother. The Lamentation of Unit 1303: The Love-Hate Hell of a Mother Daughter alone by the Sea Half a year later she was dead. With the corpse of her mother beside her, what was the daughter thinking? Now we know the hair-raising truth, sought since the incident occurred. July 18th The Rotten Mother Pressure and Release Finding Photographs Hatred of Society Revenge Suicide A Strange Way to Live Yukiyo, this is our new home. Happy birthday. Now blow out the candles. I'm back. Mother... Oh, you're back. Isn't that nice? You were out having fun. What's all this about? My stomach was hurting a little. That's what you said last time. Don't you play stupid games with me! If you don't like what your mother makes for you, then you can eat this! There! Eat! I'm back. Die... die... die... What shall we play? What are those? How dare you defile the body I gave you! What kind of a daughter are you, anyway?! Ow! Stop it! Stop it, Mother! What are you doing?! Yukiyo! What are you doing?! Murderer! Murderer! Mother... I'll always look after you. Please, Mother! Yukiyo... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Mother. Miss Sugiuchi! I know you're in there! Miss Sugiuchi! I know you're in there. Miss Sugiuchi, you're six months late on your rent. I'm afraid I have to ask you and your mother to leave. See? This is an eviction notice from the company. I'd like you out by the day after tomorrow, if you don't mind. But where am I supposed to go? I don't have anywhere else to go. This is the only place for my mother and me. If you want to live here, you have to pay the rent. If you don't leave, we'll use force and drive you out! That's what the company says. If you need to earn some money, there's lots of different ways to do it. You know what you have to do, don't you? Mother... Yukiyo, you really are a useless little girl, you know. You can't survive if I'm not here. You're miserable. That's not true. I'm quite happy living quietly here with you this way. UNKNOWN CALLER Hello? Sis? I'm scared. Sayaka?! Is that you?! Mother? Mother! I'm going to where Sayaka is. Mother. To where Sayaka is? Welcome! Cold beer! Cold beer! It's so hot! It's hard work dressing up like a maid at the beach, isn't it? Yeah, but our shop's number one in sales, you know. - Seriously? - Seriously. The manager's ecstatic. Great! I thought the swimsuit place would beat us out, though. Thanks. Hey, you're coming to that party tonight, aren't you? Sure! 6:00, right? Where was it again? The Blue Palace Hiraoka, it says. What, it's not at a bar? In a condo? Isn't that sort of suspicious? What? There's someone in there already?! Yep. Just for the season, though. They said it was a group of students working at the beach for the summer. I see... Well, I think it's a bit fast, but the company can't just let it sit empty like that. Um... - Are they girls? - I'm sorry? These students. Oh no. Boys. All of them. I see. Terribly sorry to keep you waiting. You've already got new people in that apartment, don't you? Oh, that's a seasonal rental. They're only temporary. Several people have committed suicide in the apartment, haven't they? Not just my sister. I haven't really heard anything about that... You didn't tell my sister about that, did you? Mr. Kawakami! Did you call Mr. Kobayashi on that Blue Palace condo thing for me? Oh, yeah. What was it about? The wallpaper color. Oh, right. I'll get right on it. Anyway, I'm afraid I'm not the person to talk to on that. You don't think there's anything wrong with renting out an apartment where people have died and not saying anything about it?! Ow! What the hell? Chug! Chug! Chug! What's the matter? I just have the feeling that there's someone watching me. Don't say things like that! Sorry, sorry. I read a book about Sugiuchi Yukiyo. Oh, you did? There were parts of it that I felt were almost about me. My mother started suffering from depression right after my father died. She did, did she? I always intended to do everything I could to support her, but somewhere along the line things just went bad between us. It was like my younger sister was the only one she saw anymore. So once she was gone, our house would have been... I'm so tired. I've spent far too long worrying about my mother. I'm sorry. What am I saying? That's all right. A cop hears all sorts of things. By the way, about these... - These are... - That's right. This is the one you picked up in that apartment, and this one was found with Sugiuchi Yukiyo's body. I knew it! It was in the book. It said there was a wound on her body, as if an earring had been pulled out of her ear. And then did you know all those girls who committed suicide had something in common? What is it? Since Sugiuchi Yukiyo, all of the girls who've moved into Unit 1303 have just left home and begun to live alone for the first time. What difference does that make? Nothing, probably. It's just that you're still living with your mother. Don't worry. I won't be jumping. No, I don't think so. What is it? Miss Midorigawa? Could you let me hold onto those earrings? Hold onto them? Yes. The gyu-tan game! Yay! - Gyu! - Gyu! Gyu! - Gyu! - Guy! Gyu. - Gyu! - Gyu! Gyu! - Gyu! - Wrong! Okay, you lose. Chug! Chug! Chug! What happened? Did the power go out? What? What's the matter? Breaker! Go look at the fuse box. What's that smell? Something stinks! What's that smell? What's the matter? Sorry? You look a little pale. Oh... no, I'm fine. Would you like to go back to the condominium? No, thanks. I've already spoken to the superintendent. And it looks like there's already someone else in that apartment. She may already be back home, anyway. We'll keep an eye out for your mother here. It might be a good idea if you checked back home. Yes, I'll do that. I'm sorry about all this, Mr. Sakurai. You've had a rough time, too, haven't you? - Who? Who is it? - I'm afraid I wouldn't know. What are you doing?! Stop that! Yes, that's right. It looks like three people have jumped from a balcony on the 13th floor. Mother! Mother, what are you doing here? Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Mother! Mother! You're Yukiyo, aren't you? Why?! Why did you kill my sister?! My sister... all those other girls you killed in this apartment... what did they ever do?! Hang on! You can't fall! You mustn't fall! Please! Come up! You can't fall! That's right! You can do it! No! Why does everyone just come walking into my home? What? Mother said I wasn't to let anyone in here; that everybody else was evil. Mother was right. But I let other people in here. All those girls... Mother threw them out. They were evil, so she told me to kill them... kill them all! Kill them! These are yours, aren't they? My earrings. Yukiyo, stop this! I'll look after you and your mother's apartment for you. - You're lying! - It's true! I'll live here. I'll live here together with my mother! Won't that be enough? Yukiyo... you'll be my younger sister. Miss Midorigawa! Miss Midorigawa! Miss Midorigawa! Miss Midorigawa! Yukiyo! No! My mother only has one girl... me! Sis... Sayaka. Miss Midorigawa! There goes another one.
