The king is not Elvis?. Here, king is Zohar. The flower in my garden, Alone I shall walk. You don't know these songs?. Sis, two years in lsrael, and you don't hear a little classic lsraeli music?. You've got a lot to learn. I'm I'm no no sucker. sucker. Exactly. When someone tells you something you don't like, when you feel someone tries to make you look like an idiot, you just give them that look and you say, Hey, I'm no sucker. Like this they know you're not some stupid airhead. You understand me, Ahoti?. Hey, I'm no sucker. Nice! Yeah?. Yeah. See that guy over there? The tall one with the curly hair? Step out of the car, go to the side-entrance, you'll find our man. He'll let you in quietly. Go inside, and look for them in the crowd. Go over to the Barbie in the red dress, and put a bullet in her forehead. That's what Roni wants. That'll teach the bastard killing his bitch. Go ahead. Take it. Find someone else. I won't do it.

That's what you owe us. I want my passport and my money. I want-- I want, I want. Why are you acting like a baby?. I told you a thousand times, Roni and Michael are locals. They're not like me. They have a different mindset. Why can't you understand that?. They don't trust you. Be a good girl, do what they ask and prove you're trustworthy. That's all. Barbie is in lchilov Hospital. Go there and waste her. [man and woman arguing] [shouts] Your things are here. Just a second. You want, I bring tea to put-- You put a tea bag on eye. It's good. Yes, I know. It doesn't work for me.

It's all luck, anyway. This is why I come here. It's quiet. You can concentrate. Maybe get some help from above. It works, the above?. Once, I got seven correct. I won twenty NlS. But the best place it works for me, not that I ever won there anything, but, just that I can feel a connection, something real, it's in the Mikveh. Where?. The Mikveh. It's where all the religious women go to shower. It's like this big, religious swimming pool. And every time I come out of there, I feel Iike a million dollars. Like I have this force. He never hits me when I come from there. Never. Makes you feel clean. Very special. And under water you can talk to God. You wouldn't believe it. And what will you do with money?. I don't know. I'll run away. Start somewhere new. Like you. Move to a new place. Not easy. A lot of problems. Problems?. You know what I have. Once, he loved me. He took care of me, he treated me nice. He made me feel like a woman. Today, I'm living with a monster. But your family, they help you, no?. Family. They say it's my fault. That I should try to be nice, that l should try to understand. I understand. I understand l have to get away. Somewhere, anywhere. Away from his fist. Can't let my baby suffer here. Did you tell him?. No. He doesn't deserve to know. This time I have to do something. Otherwise, either he'll kill me, or I'll kill him. And you?. You must do something with your hair. What?. I like my hair. Looks different, your drawing. Looks like Eilat. I was there a couple of times. I was there when I got married. It's a beautiful place. Eilat?. Yeah. You wanna go there?. Just the two of us. There's an express bus every hour. We can go. I can't. I have work. I'm just, uh, I'm just talking bullshit, you know?. What do I have in Eilat?. Did l lose there something?. [knocking at the door] Wait, maybe-- Get in the bathroom. What are you doing?. My hair. Alone?. [door opens] Hello. Hello. Eleanor, uh, please meet, this is Mishka. Mishka is, uh-- Uncle. Uncle for Galochka. Mishka. Eleanor. Nice to meet you. Neighbor of Galochka. Ah. Eleanor is doing my hair. It's very nice. Looks like a horse I had in Ukraine. You mean, your mother?. You're making new friends?. She's not a friend, just a neighbor. What are you two talking about?. She doesn't know a thing, relax. Sunflower seeds. Good seeds. Have some, please. I taught her some sentences. I guess she likes the language. Thank you. Do you like?. She's hot, huh?. Uh-huh. Yes. Like Miki Haimovich. Yes. Well, uh, you probably want to talk and everything, and I have things to do, so. Talk to me later?. Is this what you do instead of work?. I'm sick of looking like shit! Are you out of your mind?. I told you to finish the job! I finished it! I want my money and my passport! Go to lchilov Hospital and finish Barbie. Do it yourself. I won't kill women! Get out of here! You have 48 hours left. After that, you're on your own. Get out of here! A girlfriend of mine from work, she brought a picture from the ultrasound. It's amazing. I'm happy you come with me. It's in lchilov Hospital, yes?. Yes. I told you already three times. It's in lchilov. I go look for bathroom. Okay. Look. You can see the heart. You can tell already, huh? I have a stomach. Next month I'll look like a sweet potato. You'll look like a sweet potato, yes. But you will feel like elephant. Go fuck yourself! You'd better not draw me like this. Let me see. Let me see. I want you to take me to this place you told me. This place where a woman feels clean. What, the Mikveh?. They will never let you in. It's only for women who are married, and, me, I'm pregnant, and I have all these scars on me. They will never let me in. Take me there. I want to feel clean like normal woman. In a month you will be very heavy. If you say elephant one more time, I swear-- I had like this big. Oh. A lot of back pain. Oh. I didn't know. Yes, to carry a baby a lot of back pain. I didn't know you have a child. Girl. Really? Yes, really. Why not?. Nothing. It's just I didn't know. Your daughter, she's in Russia? Ukraine. And you came here to work, to make money for her? You're a good mother. I would do the same, you know. Don't touch it, leave it alone. Why you have this?. It's not your problem. Don't bullshit me, tell me the truth. Put it back. Teach me how to use it. I'm serious. This is not for pregnant women! Give it to me, it's dangerous. This thing is heavy. [shoots] You didn't answer me. Why do you have this?. With this rain and thunder, nobody heard anything. You owe me a TV. 21-inch plus remote control. You owe me an answer, Galia. Don't ask questions that answers you don't want to know. If you don't want to tell me, fine. At least teach me. I want to know how to use it. It's not for woman with baby. He's going to come back soon, and if you teach me to be strong like you, maybe he will stop. It's a waste of time. It does not help. Wait, Galia. Teach me. I want to know. A woman with baby needs to know how to protect herself. Two, three, four. [clap of thunder] Okay, to hit target is not most important thing. First you need to learn not to be afraid. Hold gun strong. Strong! Okay. Two, three, four. [clap of thunder] No fear, no fear. Point straight, okay?. Strong, hold the gun strong. Hazak! But I'm holding strong. No, you hold gun like little girl. Hold gun like woman. Don't let gun hold you. You hold gun. Two, three, four. [clap of thunder] Now, teach me how to aim. Who are you talking to? Tzipora. Send my regards to your sister. He sends regards, sis. Where's my drink? I n a sec. You said that an hour ago. Are you ready? Y es. Did you count like I told you?. My last period was one week ago. Y es, because they're like--The women over there are so fussy. Bring me some of the ice cream you bought. Okay. Can we go already?. Soon. Are you bringing it? The gorilla just woke up. I have to go. May you bring your mother much joy, you hear?. And many grandchildren. Thank you. Goodbye. God bless you, pious woman. Good that you came here. How are you?. Thank God. I just-- My head hit the wall. Show me. I don't think I can go in like this. It's not so bad. I'm accompanying a friend. Are you married?. She's engaged. I didn't see a ring, but okay. A bride to be. Congratulations. When is the wedding?. In two days. Did you count seven clean days?. Yes, we counted. What's your name, bride?. Galia. Galia Rasimova. Mazal! Bring out a cake, we have another bride. Maybe it is not a good idea. Give me your hand. Sure it is. It's not for me, this thing. Don't worry, it's nothing. Just like going naked into a swimming pool. Didn't you ever do this?. Not when God was looking at me. I'm not going in. Are you crazy?. They're waiting for you. Everybody has to be clean. That's for good people. But you are good people. He will see me, and he will know immediately how dirty I am. Stop talking bullshit, Galia. I did many things that are not good. In Ukraine. Also here. But worst thing I do, l-- I left me daughter and my husband. My daughter, when she was one year old, I just got up and left. What's her name? Yelena. She's five now. Why did you leave her?. She-- She didn't come out right. Hey. These things happen, Galia. It's not your fault. It just happens. The doctor said she has not enough oxygen in her brain. She will not be normal like everyone. It's all because of me. No, it's not. It's my fault. No, it's not. I know, I feel it. Hey. And I left her. I'm a monster. Galia. Hey. I can feel you love your daughter. I can feel you love her very much. Call them. I'm ready. Galia, darling, put your arms beside your body. Spread your legs a bit. Stretch your fingers out. Darling, spread your arms apart, touch no part of your body, immerse yourself three times, and you come out purified. Kosher. Kosher. Kosher. "Blessed are You, O Lord, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding the immersion. " Galia?. How's it going?. Go home. Who is that?. People from work. Go home. Go, I said. Mishka asked to give you your passport and money. Come here and take it. Get out and show me. You didn't come home. You said there's bus every hour. Let's go. What, like this?. In the middle of the day?. Come on. Come. If I go, I can't come back. Can't come back after a week, crawling like an idiot, because then he-- I will take care of you. How?. With your gun?. I told him. Told him about the baby, and he promised that he will change. A baby needs a father. I want to give him another chance. T o do what?. He promised. To do what?. Huh?. Look at this. Your face, your wounds. This you can fix. A baby you can't. He promised. They always promise. It's hot there, very hot. I think all this hot weather and all the sun is not good for the baby, you know?. I also don't know the hospital there. I don't know if it's any good or not. Forget about him, okay?. Away from him you're safe. He'll find me. I can feel it. He'll find me and he'll finish me, I know it. I can't do this. It won't stop. He'll never change. You're making a mistake. You must confront this, you must not be afraid. You have to run away. No. I don't want to. You want to run?. You can go. I stay. You go back now, you put you and your baby in danger. I know what I'm doing, Galia. You come with me. No, let go of me! You're not my mother. I'm going home. You come with me. I help you! You're not helping me, you're hurting me! I do what is good for you! Who do you think you are? All you do is run away. You run away from your country, from your family, from your child. I don't need to run away, okay?. I can take care of myself. I want my money and I want my passport. I want my money and l-- "My money and my passport." Getting cocky, huh?. I want what is mine, and I go. What is yours, huh?. What is yours?. Nothing is yours. I own you. My money and my passport. Who do you think you are, bitch?. I own your pussy. I own your soul. Everything about you, I own. Now, you be good little girl. You do good work for three months, then...maybe we talk. Now, get the fuck out. I only want what is mine. [groans] You're a waste of money. My money. Now, take your tits and get the fuck out. My money and my passport. Now! Get 100,000 and the passport. A hundred and fifty. I'm no sucker. Put on floor, close door. Relax, guys. [screams] Everything is okay. Drop the guns. Zachi, don't even think about it. Nobody shoot. Open the door! Drop the guns!. Put down your guns. Come on! Hi. This is for Kiev?. Yes. Boarding is in one hour. We will announce the moment the gate is open for boarding. Have a nice flight. Thank you. Hi. Shalom. Eleanor?. It's Galia. How are you?. I wanted to apologize. It was wrong of me to make you leave. It's your decision. Anyway, I just wanted to say goodbye before I leave. Thanks for everything, Eleanor. Goodbye. You were right. He hurt me. Get me out of here. Please, get me out of here. I think I killed him. Would you like to play with him?. He needs somebody nice to play with. Somebody nice who'd care for him. His name is Poogi. Poogi the Penguin. He wants you to hug him tight. How are you?. Are you hurt?. I'm okay. Where is he?. Is he dead?. No, just unconscious. Get your bag. Take only what you need. I'll go get bandages. No, Galia, I'm not staying here alone with him. Don't worry. I'll be right back. Don't let anyone bother me. What do I do with you?. Huh?. What do I do with you?. You know, a lot of money I put on you. A lot of money. A lot of dingi.
