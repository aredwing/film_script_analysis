What are you wearing? Ooh, something tight and white. Mm. What are you wearing? Wait, no. Let me guess. Jeans, sneakers, and that ugly striped T-shirt. (LAUGHING) Oh, my gosh. Ouch! Wow. Well, hey, the truth hurts. I wish I could be there. I know. Me too. Say it. Say, "I wish you were here." Okay, I wish you were here. Look over here. What? Other way. Hi. Hi. (CHUCKLES) You changed your hair. Yeah, I did. Do you like it? I like it. It's different. You look different. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. Hey. Oh, hey. Sorry. Aw. Are those for me? Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Ohh. Mm. There's a guy over there just prancing. He's having a... just having a prance, just on the spot. David, he's warming up. - That's his warm-up. - Really? - Yes, don't be mean. - Okay. Okay. I'm s... I'm not. You know. (LAUGHS) Can't wait to get you back home for summer. Get me home? Mm. You make me sound like a cattle drive. No, you know what I mean. Just... - Okay. - Okay. Have fun. Go. Ready? Fence. Hah! Yes! Hah! Hah! (WHISTLE BLOWS) (WHISTLE BLOWS) Yes! Hah! Hah! Hah! Yes! Fence. Ahh! Rah! Ahh! When did you learn all that? Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Oh, shit. Jill! Oh, my God, dude. I have texted, like, 100 girls, "Are you going to the party? I can't wait to see you at the party." I swear the hard drive on this thing is starting to overheat. - Holy shit. - What? She blocked me. What? (SCOFFS) - Oh, my God. Wow. - I can't believe this is happening. I'm not surprised. It's kind of a transformative year. I mean, look at me. Come on. Look. Mm! - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Wearing tighter jeans doesn't mean you've changed. If you're so in love with Jill, then why did you go all the way up there to stick your tongue in some girl's mouth? I don't know. I don't know. It just happened. - It's like I'm addicted to fucking up. - It's not fucking up, okay? You were at a campus for two hours, and you were practically in a threesome. I'm just saying, like, imagine if you spent a semester. No, no. It was a fluke. I don't want to be with anyone but Jill. Fine. Fucking suit yourself. But I'm just saying this summer is gonna be a very, very fertile one. All the beautiful girls that we knew at school have come back. You know, they have been broken. That's the hardest part. And now they're a little bit older, they're a little bit wiser, and they are ready to put their mouth on any random dick that they can find. And you know what I'm gonna do for them? I'm hoping to be that random dick. Well, I wish you luck with that. I don't need luck, man, but you might. You have been sleeping in the same bed that you've been jerking off in since you were 12. I mean, come on. You should have gone away to school, man. No. No. I like it here. I grew up here. I know where everything is. Wow, that sounds like my grandfather when he refused to go into assisted living. "Oh, I know where everything is. I'm a veteran." Grandpa, you're not a veteran. You just watch Apocalypse Now ten times a day. Come on. I'm trying to help you out, man. Dude, what the fuck? Is your dad paying the bills or what? (DOG BARKING) Bye, Dad. (INDISTINCT SPEECH OVER TV) All I wanted was to have a summer like last summer. I mean, last summer was great, right? That was great. Yeah, it was, but this year's gonna be better. I promise. Not without Jill, no. I think if we don't make up tonight, it's over. It's like she's ahead of me or something. I can feel it. Well, girls mature faster. That's all I can tell you. Wait, dude. I heard, like, Angad's parents went out of town - just so he could have this party. - Really? Yeah, like, that's some dangerously supportive parents, man. God, do you know what we should do? We should arrive at the perfect time, right? The facade of inhibition should be cracking right about now. I am going to get so drunk... (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) If Jill and I don't make up tonight, she's gonna go off and meet someone new, probably some older guy who really knows how to eat pussy. You don't know how to eat pussy? Well... No, I struggle with it sometimes. What... dude, spell your name down there. Watch. Unh! I love this girl. Stop. Can you shut up? (PEOPLE CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY) Holy fuck. My boys. Oh, eat me, Angad. Hey, dude, this is my party. Oh, no. This is your house. - The party belongs to all of us. - No, no. It looks good, Angad. It looks good Angad. Very... bright. Thank you. David, dude, I spent the whole day in the lighting department at Home Depot. Those dudes really know their shit. So... I have many surprises in store for us tonight. Enjoy the festivities. (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) - Oh, g-ah! - Uh, hi. Allison, what are you doing? Waiting for someone I don't hate. - How's that going? - Been here awhile. You finally touch a dick this year or what? Fucking cocksucker! Kyle, dude, what's wrong, man? Oh, you think you're better than me, huh? - No, man! - So you can buy drugs from me... but you can't invite me to your fucking parties? That's not what I said, man! We don't even want to come to your fucking party! Come on, man. Chill. People are just trying to have a good time. (PEOPLE MURMURING) (COUGHS AND SPITS) There's Jill. Wait. Who's she talking to? Mm. I heard you fucked up. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Oh, shit. I got to talk to her. (hip-hop music playing) (YELLS AND BARKS) (LAUGHS) Ahh! Dude, you look crazy, Stan. (LAUGHS) I know, right? Shaved my head. Heard you fucked up big-time, Davey. Have you seen her? Seen who? Ah, you're an asshole. I'm just fucking with you. She went that-away. Good luck. (PEOPLE CHEERING) Oh, it tastes so awful! More? Huh? Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! (PEOPLE SHOUTING AND CHEERING) Angad, what the hell is this? Nyotaimori. It means "adorned body of a woman." Does she hand it to me, or, like... No, dude. It's a body buffet. Help yourself. All right, then. Oh. Mmm! Thank you! Mmm. Do you do birthdays? Like, weddings, maybe? Yo, dude. - What the fuck are you looking at? - Oh, hey, guys. So are you a Peeping Tom now? No. - Is Jill out there? - Yeah. She's blowing a line of guys. (LAUGHS) (LAUGHING) - David blew it with Jill. - Ooh, sucks for you, man. - I just saw her in the living room. - I was just there. Well, you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, then. - She was talking to Steve. - Uh-oh. - Wait. Who's Steve? - Some older dude... great lips. Give her some space. When I was talking to her, she looked ready to kill. (PEOPLE CHEERING) (UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Don't tell me It's another likely story Whoo! I'm new here Doesn't mean I have to answer silly questions Or a shot in the dark Hey. Hi. May... may I sit? Yeah. Oh, well, that's... that's all I can ask for. (SIGHS) I'm Teddy, by the way. - Melanie. - Melanie. - Melanie. - Nice to meet you. You too. Nice to meet you. Cool. And who do you know? Not a lot of people. - Oh, wow. - Yeah. Is that why you're sitting here by yourself? So I know what you're thinking. The answer is yes, my carpet matches my drapes. You are out of control. No, no, I'm... I'm actually in complete control. Oh, see, the thing is, you think you are, but you're not. I kind of think that you're into me. - Well, I do think you're funny. - Yeah. Yeah? Like, funny "ha-ha" or funny "strange"? - (CHUCKLES) - What? I mean, do you have a preference? 'Cause I could go either way. Party like fuck! (RHYTHMIC BANGING) (BANGING CONTINUES) Yeah! (LAUGHS) Whoo! Time to throw out the trash! It's about to get real cold in here! Here we go! (WOMEN SCREAMING) The ground shakes, things fall apart Yeah. Yeah, basically... (LAUGHTER) (BOTH CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY) Ohh! (SHOUTING IN JAPANESE) Craig fucking bit her! (SHOUTING IN JAPANESE) Wait! Wait! Wait! No! No! (GLASS SHATTERING) (LAUGHTER) What's up, Allison? You got all sexy since last year. Are you working out? I... pace a lot. I can see you got a hot body, even though you cover it up. It's called clothing. Why don't we remove some of it? If only you had opposable thumbs. (LAUGHS) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (LAUGHTER) I'm sorry. Ah, my girlfriend dared me. She's a bitch! You look crazed. Yeah. Have you seen her? I'm not exactly looking. No offense. (SIGHS) Well, she was just here. She was just... Hey, do-do you think people ever get what they deserve? Well, if they do, Allison... if they do, you're gonna be a very happy person someday, okay? (SIGHS) Every once in a while, you say something awesome. Mm, every once in a while, yeah. Thank you. Tell Jill that, please. Can you remind her? - Oh, my God. - Okay. It's on. Yeah! (GRUNTING) F-f-fucking savages, right? I've come to a conclusion. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. "Conclusion" means the end of something... No, no, no, no. No. I have a surprise for you. A surprise? I like surprises. Oh, you like surprises? Well, meet me upstairs in ten minutes, and I'll give it to you. Where? I... Better pay attention... Teddy. Okay, I can do that. Sorry. Watch it. I just scored my number one draft pick. - What the hell does that mean? - Melanie Tremblay, she just... she asked me to, like, go upstairs. She says she has a surprise for me. She's probably crawling out a window right now. Oh, wow! Huh! You're gonna grow old with a lot of cats. Okay, fuck you, Teddy. You don't even know me. Please, can we have a moment? - Yeah, how goes Good Jill Hunting? - Can you please do me a favor? If you see her anywhere, you have to tell me. Yeah, do you know what? I'm gonna... I'll text you, but, please, dude, just... (PEOPLE CHEERING) What was that? Don't, Kyle. Shut up. Rad. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Oh, shit. Kyle. Kyle. Kyle. Fuck, Bonnie! What? What's your problem? (GASPS) (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) (UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Jill? (METALLIC CLATTERING) (WOMAN YELLS) I got it! (GRUNTS) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Relax! Remain calm! Everything is under control! Nobody panic! (PEOPLE CHEERING) (INTENSE TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING) David! Dude, I told you those fuckers at Home Depot knew what they were doing! It's a great party. (SIGHS) Okay. All right. (LAUGHTER) Here we go. Oh, wow. Shoe-shoes off. Right. Yeah. (GRUNTS) Yeah. Look, is there somewhere I can go to get away from all this? I just... I need to get my shit together. Just for a minute. My parents' bedroom. Okay. Up the stairs, last door on the left. Don't fuck anything up! Attention, visitors! Do you have room for two in there? I know we're going gung ho But the night is still young, though (PEOPLE CHEERING) And all the guys who are horndogs (MEN CHEERING) Now every one of us (PEOPLE CHEERING) So let me hear your lungs go (PEOPLE CHEERING) Will you just give me a chance? - For what? - To apologize. I just... I just want to apologize to you. Okay. Look, can we go somewhere private? Please? Everyone, follow me outside! Party's just getting started, so get ready to rock! Yeah! Yeah! (THUMPING DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Mm. Wow. You have been blessed with so many gifts. Mm. Oh, no, no, no, no. Keep a light on. All right? Jill, I'm really sorry. For what, exactly? You don't even know what you're apologizing for. It's not for the kiss? That's only part of it, David. Well, what's the other part? You made me feel replaceable. Oh, no. I could never replace you. You know, it's not only... it's not only what you did. It's who. It's where. It's when. It's like you stepped into a part of my life where you didn't belong. I thought I belonged everywhere. I guess you don't. Oh, well. (BOTH MOANING) Your skin is so soft. (KISSING AND MOANING) And you smell so yummy. Less words. (GRUNTING) (BOTH MOANING) Yeah. (BOTH MOANING) Wha... huh! Yes! Oh! - You like that? - Yeah! You like that, you little stupid fuck? - Yes! - That's good. (POUNDING ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) May your good health be twofold. (SNIFFS) This is a delicacy in my country. Hey, fucking come on! (PEOPLE CHEERING) I just want to forget this ever happened, okay? I just... That is a really stupid thing to say. Jill, we've been together a long time. Two years really isn't that long. What? No, it's not. No, it's, like... what is it... 730 days, two years. It's a long time. You're an idiot. Oh, I love it! (LAUGHS) All right! Now, before we head to the back of the garden, I got one more surprise. Ooh! You're so good, Teddy. Teddy, right? Yeah. You like playing dirty? Ow! (LAUGHS) Are you in pain? Oh! Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Suck it. (BOTH MOANING) So good. You like all of them? (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (LAUGHTER) (UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (SIGHS) I wish you'd never gone away. So you want me stuck here? No, I don't want you stuck. I just want you here with me. Right. You know what I mean. No, David, I don't know what you mean. I don't. Tell me what you mean, David. I just mean, like, if we worked it out, we wouldn't be fighting right now. We'd be out there having fun with everyone else, but instead we're, like, fighting each other, you know? So this is... this is now... this is all my fault? - I get it. - No, you don't get it. You don't get it. It's not your fault, and I'm not saying it's your fault. Just answer me one question. - What do you do? - What? Well, you don't want to do anything new. All you care about is that this summer is like last summer, but what about next year? You don't want anything to change, including me. - Jill, come on. - What? - I came here to apologize. - Well, you suck at it. You suck at it. You know what? You were right about one thing, though. If I were out there having fun with everyone else, I wouldn't be wasting my time on somebody who's gonna play the same games for the rest of his life. Like Steve? Who? Oh, who? Steve? Steven? - Come on. I have eyes, Jill. - What are you talking about? I'm talki... Okay. So that's where you're gonna go with this? That's where you're gonna choose to go? Really smart, David. How dare you? - How dare you? - Slow down, please. - Slow down? - Yes, Jill. Yeah, I should be the one who slows down. - Can you just... - Yeah. You know what, David? You already got your chance. You got it, and every second that passes is a second that you don't get to get back. I just wish none of this had happened, okay? I bet you do, David. I bet you do. But you know what? Wishing is for little kids. You are what you do, and you do nothing. - Please, come on... - Don't touch me. I'll do anything... anything... to keep you. - To keep me? - Yeah. I don't know what I ever saw in you. (BOTH MOANING) - Oh! - Oh, God! Oh, yes! Oh! Yeah! Oh, yes! - Careful. - Yes. - Yes. - Oh, so good. Yeah. No! Hold on. - I can't. - Yes, you can. - I can't. No. - Hold on. Yes, you can. - I'm trying! - Hold on. I know! I'm trying! - Hold on! - I'm trying! (SNIFFLING) - Hold on! - I'm trying! - Hold on! - Okay, I'm trying! Oh! Hold on! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes. Oh! Oh! Oh! Yes! Yes! Oh! (DISTORTED) Oh, yeah! Oh! (PEOPLE CHEERING) (CHEERS DWINDLING) (GASPS) (GASPS) Looks like we blew a fuse. (LAUGHS) Oh, you're funny too. I'm glad you finally noticed. (CHUCKLES) (BOTH SIGH) I'm gonna take a shower. Oh. (GRUNTS) (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (WATER RUNNING) (PEOPLE CHEERING) There will be light! (CHUCKLES) (BED CREAKING) How did you sneak in here? Huh? Fuck you! Fuck you! Get out of here! Where did you come from? Where did you come from? Oh, are you getting shy now? What's going on? Who the fuck are you, man? What do you want? I'm gonna fuck you up! Who the fuck are you? Whoa, man! Stay back! Get the fuck out of here! No! Fuck you, motherfucker. (GUNSHOT) (GASPS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (WATER RUNNING) Oh, you didn't invite somebody else, did you? (PEOPLE CHEERING) What the fuck? What is going on? Wait. (BREATHING HEAVILY) I managed to wash off your scent. The fu... Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Ahh! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Oh, it tastes so awful! (PANTING) (LAUGHS) Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! What the fuck is going on? I have no idea. Somethings really wrong. We don't know those people. Look at this. Look. (UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) (CROWD CHEERING) - Who's out there? - Everybody. Everybody's out there, and they're down here too. David, I just saw another me downstairs. What? I saw another Teddy, another Angad, another Stan. Something is seriously wrong. There's suddenly two of everyone. - Am I fucking nuts? - No. No. I saw something too. I thought I was seeing things. What is it? Oh, my God. I saw it happen. Somebody that looked just like him shot Kyle dead and ran. (GASPS) Are they gonna kill us too? Who knows? Calm down, okay? What should we do? We got to figure out what's going on. I'm thinking something happened with the power outage. We had one earlier at my house. Guys, guys. You're not gonna fucking believe what I just saw. I think we will. What the fuck? Guys, everyone we know is still outside. I just saw two identical Melanies in the same room. What did you do? Well, what? I ran. You left her in there? What the fuck was I supposed to do, huh? Should I go back there? I should go back. Where did these people come from? Even the music's repeating itself. There are two songs playing right now. Then we should get the fuck out of here. No, not without Jill. (LAUGHS) Where... where is Jill? She-she must be outside. Well, do you see her? No... but I see you. Hey, yeah. You're looking for Jill, just like before. (LAUGHS) Whoo! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Wait a minute. Everything's gonna happen again? (UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Don't tell me It's another likely story Could've pinned it on you from the start (ALL BREATHING HEAVILY) Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, there's one right behind us. Okay, stay calm. Just stay calm. Should we rush him? Fuck. No, we should get the fuck out of here. Wait. Guys, if they know that we're here... (BREATHING HEAVILY) - I have to go down there. - No, no, no, no. Don't. Don't. You saw what happened. What? What happened? I just saw two identical Kyles fighting outside. One of them shot and killed the other, but I... I don't know who killed who. Fuck. Fuck. We're dead. I'm going down there. - No, no. David, don't. - Just wait a second! At least come up with a plan or something. Hot ass coming through! What the fuck is he doing? He's gonna give us away. Talk to her. It'll be hilarious. Fuck it. Fuck what? No, no, no, no, no. Don't-don't-don't leave me. Don't... Shit. It's time to throw out the trash! It's about to get real cold in here! Here we go! (LAUGHTER) Ohh! (SHOUTING IN JAPANESE) Craig fucking bit her! (SHOUTING IN JAPANESE) Wait! Hey, no! No! (GRUNTS) (SHOUTING IN JAPANESE) Hey. You found my hat. I can see you got a hot body, even though you cover it up. It's called clothing. Why don't we remove some of it? If only you had opposable thumbs. (LAUGHTER) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My girlfriend dared me. She's a bitch! (GASPS) Fucking freak! Are... are you kidding me? Jill? (METALLIC CLATTERING) What's your name? David. Who the fuck are you? What did you bring to Jill's match? Roses? (GLASS SHATTERING) I got it! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Relax! Remain calm! Everything is under control! Nobody panic! (PEOPLE CHEERING) (INTENSE TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) Okay. All right. Here we go. Whoa. David, I-I just saw Jill upstairs. Which one? I-I don't know. Listen, she's gonna try and come down soon, okay? I need you to stall her. If there's still one outside, that must mean the one upstairs is the second one, - and I want to speak to her. - The second one? Why? - Just stall her, Teddy, please. - Okay, okay. Hurry. - Dude, wait. - What? How do I know which one you are? 'Cause I know what the fuck you're talking about. Right. Jill... Hi... Uh, oh. Hey... Hi, Teddy. Hey, how are you feeling? I'm fine. Good. That's... good. Stick that in there. Yeah. I'm just Teddy, looking for some friendly conversation. (SIGHS) What do you want? Nothing. I-I just... I wanted to see how you were enjoying the party. I'm enjoying it. Thank you. That's good. That's great. Whoo! Stan, Jesus. Fucking party, bro! Hey, these fancy strippers are making all the girls horny! (PEOPLE CHEERING) Party! (LAUGHING) Dave! David, I'm making history tonight, David! This party will literally never be forgotten! I have never seen Jill like this. You should piss her off more often. Wait. Wait. Wait. Where are you going? We need more tequila back here. Yeah, no. I'll go get it for you. You just stay right there. Aw, thanks, man! You're all right, man, not like Teddy! He's a dick juicer! (CHUCKLES) - What do you want? - Nothing. I just... I wanted to know, like, have you ever... met yourself in a dream, maybe? Okay, how much have you had to drink? - Just only, like, two... - Jill! (SIGHS) Okay. Let's try this again. Try what again, David? Um... can you give a chance to apologize? Yeah, go on. Get it over with. (GLASS CRUNCHING) Ugh, did you see which idiot broke this bottle? (BIRD SQUAWKING) You know, your cage is looking pretty good to me right now. Attention, visitors! You have room for three in there? I know we're going gung ho But the night is still young, though (PEOPLE CHEERING) And all the guys who are horndogs (LAUGHS) Got you, hey! (LAUGHS) Now every one of us (PEOPLE CHEERING) Oh, my God. Okay. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Go time. You told me you had a surprise. I'm just saying let's roll with it. Steady, now. Jill, I'm really sorry. For what, exactly? For making you feel replaceable. Jill, we've been together for 730 days. You counted? I mean... we've been together for two years, which is 730 days. You know what? This isn't just about what you did. - It's about who. It's about... - BOTH: Where and when. Yeah, it's like I stepped into a part of your life where I don't belong. - Right. - Right. You did. I just wish none of this had ever happened. - Well, wishing is for little... - Is for little children. I know, and that's the thing. I can't help it. This whole thing's got me feeling like a stupid little kid. Stop. Where did you hear that? Where did you hear that, that wishing is for little children? Can you just give me another chance? How many chances do you get? I know we only get one chance. We only get one chance, and every second that passes is gone forever. I have to... I have to ask. Okay, I... I just... I just have a really weird feeling right now. No, Jill. When... When I was watching you from the bleachers... What were you possibly thinking? I was thinking that I could barely recognize you. It's like you're this different person, and I... I couldn't be sure if that person would like this person. That doesn't mean, David, that you go off... I felt like you were moving on, like you were moving up in the world and I was just there. I was just... there. I think the kiss was a really stupid, stupid way of making everything just stop so I could catch up. I understand if you want to move on. It'll kill me, but... I see there's nothing else I can do. (SIGHS) All I can do is ask for one last chance. (SIGHS) I don't know, David. I don't want to stand still anymore. Jill? Jill! Hello? (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GASPS) Stay away from me. Which one are you? (TABLE CLATTERING) (GLASS SHATTERING) Jill? (BOTH MOANING) Never mind. Oh! Oh! Yes! (BOTH MOANING) - Hold on. - I can't. - Yes, you can. - No! - Hold on. - I can't! - Hold on! - I'm trying! (GASPS) Ah! What the fuck is going on? (WHIMPERS) Shit. Come on. (DOOR SLAMS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Jill! Shit! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Did she hurt you? No, she looked as scared of me as I did of her. I-I don't get it. Teddy, what is happening? This is happening all over the house. - There's, like, two of everybody. - Who are they? (PEOPLE CHEERING) They're... they're us. They're us, but they're not us, and something keeps happening to us when we lose power or... What are you talking about? It's like, they move. Okay, when they came back, it was on the floor, right? It was, like, 15 minutes later or 15 minutes closer. Closer to what? Closer to us in time. It's like they're catching up to us. But, Teddy, that is me in there. I just cock-blocked myself, okay? And if he's anything like me, he's gonna be pissed. Who are you hiding from? You're a weird dude, man. David. David. Hey. This is Melanie. I know. These fuckers, they're moving closer in time with each one of those blackouts. It's like they're gaining on us. May your good health be twofold! They're going outside just like before. Fuck. They're moving closer towards everyone else. What happens if everybody out there sees themselves coming at them? Come on! (UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Can you feel, can you feel Can you feel, can you feel Can you feel it? (PEOPLE CHEERING) Whoo! (LAUGHS) Ha! Whoo! I like the way you dance when you're angry. Who says that I'm angry? David. Okay, please. Mind if I cut in? Are you serious? Look at that! (PEOPLE CHEERING) Before we head to the back of the garden, I got one more surprise. If they're gaining on us in time, then that means they might catch up to us if there's another one of those blackouts. Then what? Surprise! Fucking awesome! (PEOPLE CHATTERING) They could take over our bodies. Our lives could change forever. Or we could change them. No, I don't want to change. This was the best night of my life. There's a grenade on the floor Get low, get low There's a grenade on the floor Get low, get low There's a grenade on the floor Get low, get low There's a grenade on the floor Get low, get low There's a grenade on the floor Get low, get low There's a grenade on the floor Get low, get low There's a grenade on the floor Get low, get low There's a grenade on the floor Get low, get low Good Lord, I launched a grenade, hey Ducking for cover, yeah I'm fighting by the stage This might have been the place everybody cool Then I act a fool I'm making hell on them, dude So much ass Shake it, shake it, shake it Shake it down low Shake it, shake it, shake it To the damn floor Shake it, shake it All right! Now, everybody, follow me to the back of the garden! So many rides I'm on the hunt (GRUNTING) Wait. Holy shit. It's okay. I'm... I'm not gonna hurt you. Who the fuck are you? I'm Allison.

Two sets of twins? Where did you find them? And don't tell me motherfucking Home Depot! I told you tonight would be full of surprises. (LAUGHS) Yeah, right there! What do you want? BOTH: Why did you come here? I don't know. I think we should go inside... both of us, together. It's really lame out there. (DISTANT CHEERING) - We may be running out of time. - Yeah, no shit, David. We have to work together on this, okay? - It's not all about... - I had her, Teddy. - Who are you talking about? - Don't say it. I was fixing it. I was. I was. I was fixing it. - Jill was about to forgive me. - Do you even care which one? (PEOPLE CHEERING) Shit. Come on. Come on! Jill? I've been looking for you everywhere. - You know what? You're on your own! - Are you insane? What? (PEOPLE BOOING) Hey! Hey! Hey, everybody! Everybody listen! Listen up, okay? We're in danger! Blow me! No, please listen! Listen! You think that after everything that you said to me that I'm gonna want to give you a hug? I-I thought we resolved all that. Are you high? Oh. Sorry. Um... I-I thought you were someone else. Okay, well, that's a really nice thing to say. No. No. I didn't mean it like that. - I-I just... - You know what? No. I'm not... I'm not gonna let you do this, okay? I'm not gonna let... I'm not gonna let you do this. This is all your fault. - I know I made you feel replaceable. - David, just stop it, all right? - Stop it. - Jill, I love you so much. Do not touch me. Jill, I just need one more chance, okay? You know what, David? You already had your chance. You are so pitiful. Start dancing, dude! No, no, no! Please, please! You just have to trust me! I don't know how much time we have! You suck! So, everybody, we need to hide! Do you think they'll be back? (SIGHS) At least we can be ready for them this time. Look, something terrible is about to happen! We have to find somewhere to hide, okay? I can't explain it right now, but we're in danger! The lights... the lights... they could come back on at any second, so, please, I know it sounds crazy, but you have to listen to me! I don't know how much time we have! I just need everybody to hide! It's our only chance to buy some time, so, please, if you could all just go to the pool house. Go to the pool house, and I will explain everything. If you could just all please go! Turn the music back on! (PEOPLE CHEERING) - Yeah, turn it on! - No, no, no, no, no, no! You don't want the music to go back on! Put it on! ALL: Put it on! You don't want the lights to come back on! ALL: Put it on! Put it on! Stop! He's right! Something is wrong! I've seen things too! Everybody, please get in the pool house quickly! I saw something too. (PEOPLE MURMURING) Quickly! Everybody go! Hurry! Hurry UP! Jill, hey. Come on. Teddy, Teddy, what are you doing? David would never forgive me if I let anything happen to you. Everybody, faster, please! I don't give a shit what you or David think. Great. Keep moving in! Go! Great. You know what, Steve? - Come on. Let's just go. - Wait a second. I kind of want to hear what Teddy's talking about. All right. Whatever. Fine. Everybody hurry! Faster! - Come on. - Just let go of me! - It's for your own good. - Let me go! Quickly, come on! Jesus! Keep going! Faster! Hurry up! (PEOPLE MURMURING) (DOOR SLAMS) (SIGHS) (LIQUID TRICKLING) What? Oh, my God. What the fuck is the story, Teddy? I-I don't know where to begin. - You'd better start somewhere, bro. - Just give him a chance. Something strange is happening, okay? I can't explain it. I only tell you what I've seen. There are doubles... or duplicates... other versions of us, okay? They're all out there, and they're here tonight. He's having a bad trip. What the fuck, Teddy? All this for a bad trip? I've seen it too, all right? Well, I guess you're on the same trip. - You know what? Back off. - You back off, boy! (BREATHING HEAVILY) Stay away from him, all right? (BANGING ON DOOR) (PEOPLE MURMURING) Open the door! Open the door! - It's Tracey. - Open up! Okay, okay, but which one? What the fuck are you talking about? No, no, no, no, wait. What the fuck's wrong with you? - Somebody killed Kyle. - What? There's a killer out there. Our lives are in danger. There's a grenade on the floor Get low, get low It's what I've been trying to tell you. Who the fuck are they? Look closer. There's a grenade on the floor Get low, get low There's a grenade on the floor We're back onstage? Get low, get low There's a grenade on the floor Get low, get low There's a grenade on the floor Oh, my God. - What the fuck was that? - Shh! Quiet, quiet. What was that I just saw? I want you to keep it down. That's me. We're only a few minutes apart from them now.

Why isn't he afraid of them? He should be. (PEOPLE GASPING) Party! I just did that a few minutes ago. They're repeating what we did, or at least they're trying to. Why the fuck do you know so much, Teddy? Because we saw this happen in the house. Who? - Me, Melanie, David, and Allison. - Everyone, just stay calm. Why in the fuck are you so fucking calm? And don't tell me this is another one of your fucking surprises! Stop! Stop! Okay, look, we have to work together. You guys, they're looking in. Get down. - Get down. Get down. - Get the fuck down. So much ass Shake it, shake it, shake it Shorty got low Shake it, shake it, shake it Hey, Angad, where's David? I like the way you dance when you're angry. I'm not dancing, and I'm not angry. I done pulled the pin I was just talking to him. Do you... Okay. 'Cause I kill 'em in the club Go on, get low I'm gonna blow the place up Good Lord Grenade on the floor Get low, get low There's a grenade on the floor Get low, get low There's a grenade on the floor - Hey. - Dude. You are always in the wrong place at the wrong time. Look, Steve, he's a profiteer, all right, and he's on the hunt. So what he's gonna do is fuck your girl unless you go the other way and get her back! Dude! Man, you're crazy! Get the fuck out of the window! I'm not gonna tell you again! What do they want? I don't know. Are they dangerous? David... he said he saw something. He said he saw one of them shoot and kill Kyle. What else, Teddy? They move. With each one of those blackouts, they disappear and reappear closer in time. - It's like they're catching up to us. - Oh, my God. We're only a few minutes from them now. What happens if they do catch up? I mean, what does that mean for us? (BANGING ON ROOF) Whoo! (LAUGHS) Yeah! You're gonna break through, you idiot. Whoo! (SIGHS) I-I think I stop in a second. (UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Whoo! Baby! (LAUGHS) Maybe we have less to worry about than we think. What do you mean? If the universe is really infinite, it means mathematically, there must be replicas of our solar system out there. You've got to be kidding me. Look, just because they exist doesn't mean they're out to get us. She's right. - Yeah? How do you figure? - From the book of Talmud. To meet oneself is to meet God. Yeah, well, in my book, to meet God means to be dead. Has anybody seen David? Have you seen David? (PEOPLE CHEERING) Which one are you? Which one are you? Teddy, you spaz. You caused a collision, bro. Take it easy. Hey, listen! Everybody listen, all right? What's going on? What the... Listen to me, okay? Oh, no. What's that? You're about to send them our way. - We don't have much time, all right? - You suck! Look! Listen! I saw something, okay? I saw something! We were there! We were there, and then we were gone, and then we came back. We were still there... like, other versions of us! Listen to me. They're gonna take us over, all right? (BREATHING HEAVILY) They fucked with me, all right? They fucked with me, and they're gonna fuck with you too. Everything you care about is gonna be taken from you. We're headed for a collision, okay? We're getting too close to them. I mean, come on. Think about it. Think about it, everybody. Have you felt strange tonight? I mean, haven't you felt it? Like something's strange, something's off? We're gonna land on the exact same spot as them, and then what, huh? Then what? Who's gonna be left, us or them? They're not exactly like us, people! That's the problem! He's right. Who's right? That Teddy is having a different experience than you did. We've messed with the last 20 minutes of their life, and now he's up there saying things that you never said before. So? So that means that they're hearing something different and everybody's thinking something different. Fuck, will anybody even be able to tell? We're no longer the same. Let's go get 'em. We don't even understand this yet. We don't have time to. Look, we get them before they get us, and they won't be catching up with anybody. But if we hurt them, maybe we'll be hurting ourselves. That's a chance I'm willing to take. I don't have all the answers. I don't. I don't. But I-I do know that we all need to stick together. If we don't, we're dead. Put the music back on! ALL: Yeah! No, fuck you! Listen! Please! I'm trying to help you! Look, if they take us over, it's gonna change our lives! We could become different people! (GRUNTING) ALL: Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! This could be the last night of our lives! ALL: Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! They're gonna take us over! You don't realize this! (GRUNTS) (CHOKING) They fucked with me! They're gonna fuck with all of you! ALL: Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! (GRUNTS) ALL: Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! Put it on! (SCREAMING) Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Go! Go! Open the door! Clear a hole! - Come on! - Get in! Hurry up! Will you listen to me? Clear a hole! Come on, move it! Shit! (BANGING) Hold tight! Hold the door! I've never felt this way before. I never thought I'd hear myself say that. Do you think we'll be alone forever? (SIGHS) Mm. (EERIE WARBLING) Do you hear that noise? I've been hearing it all night. Just relax. This is my specialty. (SIGHS) Mm. (SIGHS) Steve? (BREATHING HEAVILY) They're gone. But where'd they go? I'm more interested to find out where they'll be next. Maybe they won't come back. Maybe that's it. Not good. That's not good. (SCOFFS) Steve! Damn it, David! Damn it, David, this is over, okay? (GRUNTS) (GASPS) I love you. It's gonna be okay. I promise. (THUDDING BASS MUSIC) (PEOPLE CLAMORING) What? What? (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Stop! Stop! (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (COUGHING) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) David? What's going on? What happened? David, where did you go? (BREATHING HEAVILY) What happened? I never meant to hurt you. I was just afraid. I was afraid I might lose you. David, you might. That's just part of it. I'll never try to hold you back again. Good, because you can't. I might have to change everything... everything but you. I feel like we're getting closer to each other. Me too. (PEOPLE MURMURING AND WHIMPERING) I think it's over. Time lag's gone. There's only one of us now... but which one? Call me?
