Ben. He... he hit his head. And your name? Angela. Ok, where are your parents, Angela? Angela? There is so much blood. No! You... Angela, if you know your address, I need you to tell me that. I need you to... Hello? BEAUTIFUL PRISON You, too, Ben. Ben. Come on. Let's go, lunch. Come on. Let's go. Angie. Hey, I brought you your favorite. -Lasagna. -Here you go. -Hey, baby. -Hey. You brought lasagna? No, not for you, I got you some salad... here you go... and some fat-free ranch dressing, for your blood pressure. I hate my life. Ben, bro, can I have some of that? Just a little bit, I'm just... I'm not... did Angie make this for you? I love that woman. So don't forget to pay Ben's rent this month. -His rent? -Yes. We just paid rent. Baby, it's the 30th. That was last month. Maybe take about 1,000 pesos for his first groceries, too. I'm always paying. Baby, he's family. Not my family. -Hey, Jerry. -So much, she's so... -Hi. -What's up? Hi, so, listen. Today's Tuesday. Tuesday, when was that? So don't forget about, you know. Groceries, Tuesday, I know. How are you? I'm wonderful. Thank you. I want to talk to you about something. Number one, you look fabulous. Well, thanks, Jerry. Can I compliment a married woman? I think I just did, and this lasagna... Is so scrumptious. Thank you. You put a lot of love into everything, and I appreciate that about you. -Thank you. -You deserve love. I get love. Chente, Chente, did you get any of this lasagna? Did he get any of this lasagna? No, he didn't. Shit. , Ben. This is the second time this week. -What were you doing? -Chente, bro, chill out. Stay out of this, Jerry. Who do you think got him this job? This reflects on me. Really? Really? I'll see you in 10 minutes. B, B, forget about that shit, ok? You do your thing. Pick this up. Do your thing. Forget it. You're all right. You're all right. Sorry, seor. Don't do it, Jubilee. Don't do it. Ben, don't do it, Jubilee? I can hear that shit out in the street. Are you ready? Ben, groceries, it's Tuesday. Yeah. Listen. I'm gonna use the bathroom. I'm gonna wash my hands real quick, and then we're gonna go, ok? Ben, Ben, I hear she's a bitch in real life. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. Loosen up, bro. He didn't mean that. You all right? Jerry's going number two. Where's your toilet paper? Never mind, I found it. I'm almost done, Ben. Come on, Ben. Let's go down the cereal aisle. You want Choco Bolito? Ben, don't look at that shit. What did I tell you about that? Ok, now, stay right here. You want Choco Bolitos? Ok, all right, I'm gonna go with Dino Flakes... Dino Flakes. You like that, don't you? You like that shit, when I do that kind of shit? Yeah. See, this is the kind of Ben that I need. I want... can I talk to you for a second? When you're at work, you gotta keep your mind focused, ok, buddy, ok? I don't want to get all serious, but you gotta keep your mind focused, ok, like Jerry. When Jerry punches into work, on the clock, he's like, you know? I'm like, hoo. I'm there. I'm there to do a job, and I do it. And I focus on the task at hand. ok, Ben? You gotta focus on the task at hand, all right? -Ok. -Yeah. -Ok. Ok. -You got it. You got this, shit. Ok. Listen, another thing. Your brother-in-law, Chente, he's a mean-ass dick, and it sucks that your hot sister married him. He's always mad at me. Bro, when I get a chance, I'm gonna slap his ass. I hate that he's always mad at you, man. You're a good man, Ben. Ben,... there's your girl, all over the world. What are they saying? What? What are they saying, Jerry? What are they saying? Let me check. Ok. -What are they saying? -Shit. What is it? What is it, Jerry? What? Jubilee died. I'm sorry. -Hey, hey, hey. -No. Hey, no, I'm kidding, man. I'm kidding. She ain't dead. I'm sorry, Ben. No. ok, he's fine. He's fine. Ben, Ben, I'm kidding, man. That was a joke. Jerry's a dick. Jerry's a dick. She ain't dead, Bro. She's coming to Saltillo. She's coming to Saltillo? -Yeah, yeah. -She's coming to Saltillo? Come on. Yeah, man. -She's coming to Saltillo? -Yeah. She's coming to Saltillo? Yeah, she's coming to Saltillo, yeah. Yeah. What do you think? Yeah, you want to meet her? Yeah. -You want to meet her? -Yeah, yeah. , man. -She's coming to Saltillo? -Yeah. I know you're an angel... but I'm not sure you can fly. Ben. They told me you were dead. What did I tell you? Our love will keep you alive. And it has. Ben, Ben, come on. What the hell? What the hell? Shit, I'm sorry. Go. Get out of here. Go. Go. Jerry will take care of this. It's ok. Jerry will take care of it. Where is Ben? Where is Ben? He's taking a leak. Yeah? I don't know this machinery. It got away from me. Bueno? Yeah. Yeah, you understand you have to take a drug test now. You know where to go. Chente, you want my piss? All right. I don't want to go. Come on. Chente. Chente. I gave you five years, Chente. Jerry, Jerry. Whatever, I don't need you. I don't need this place. You guys are gonna crumble in six months, anyway, without me. That's right. Look out the windows at me. I ain't crazy. You're crazy. I'm gonna smoke a blunt. Where's Jerry going? Get back to work, Ben. Wha... where's Jerry going, Chente? -Shut up, Ben. -Where's Jerry going? -Shut up. -Where's Jerry going? If you don't shut the hell up, you're getting fired, too. I'm saving your ass here. Hey, what's up? You've reached Jerry. Jerry, it's Ben. Where... I'm not here right now, so leave a message at the tone. Jerry, it's Ben. I don't know where you are or if you can call me or come... come to my house. I'm sorry if I made trouble for you. He's costing us money. He's, like, working there, but his mind is in another place, you know? You just have to be patient with him. Just be patient. No, I've been patient. I got him that job, you know, for you. Yeah, you said he needed something to do. Don't do that. Do not turn this around on me. No, no, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know, this isn't... it's just that I'm going to get fired, and then neither of us are going to have a job. We can't take care of him our whole lives. We need to put him in a place where he can be managed. Managed? Yeah, where he can be looked after and be with other people like him. He's not like other people. He... he wasn't always like this, and you know that, Chente. If you had grown up with our father, if you'd seen the kind of abuse that Ben went through... I'm sorry. I just... I... I'd rather he move into the house with us than put him into some God-forsaken institution. No, no, that's not an option. It's worth discussing. No, he can't move in here and disrupt our lives. My God. Baby, I'm sorry. Come on. I'm sorry. We never fought before I got him this job, and now all we do is fight about Ben. Maybe he is ruining us. I didn't say, I do, to both you and him. He's got... Ben. Dinner is ready. Ben, pass me the salt. Ben, pass me the salt. All right, I cannot take this shit from either of you anymore, you guys. I... all right, Ben, Chente is my husband, and I love him very much, all right? And you're going to have to accept that. And, Chente, Ben is a part of our family, and you're just going to have to grow up about it. He's always being mean. I'm your boss, Ben. I have to be tough when people don't do their jobs. Does that make sense, Ben? He fired Jerry. -You fired Jerry? -I had to. I had to, to save your brother's ass, so instead of keeping an employee around who can manage a line, I kept Ben here, Ben the retard. Chente, what the hell? My... No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Get the fuck out of my house, man. This is my family. Stop it. Stay down, Ben. He can't defend himself! All you do is hold us back, Ben. Stop! Please just stop! My God. My God. When I tell you to do something, you do it! No, no, no, no, Ben! Ben! Look at you, you little shit. Ben? Ben. Ben. Thank God. That's ok. I got it. Hey, I have your medicine. Thanks. Ben, I don't know what to say, man. All this... You can't know how terrible I feel. I take equal blame. I'm just... I've come for the one I love. I made the mistake of letting you go once. I'm done making mistakes. You can't forget me, Ben. You can't forget me! That's not funny at all. That's... Spanish... I can understand you, and you... and you, and you. Hello? Hello? Who's there? Hello? Who's there? Hello? Hello? Jerry? Hey, Ben. Angela. Sorry it took me so long to visit. I just, I just needed some time to clear up my head. I brought you some flowers. Make this place a little homier. Thank you. Ben, I, I wish Mom was still around. Me, too, of course. You were, you were way to young to remember any of this, but, when we were little, we were swimming in Uncle Frank's pool. You were just learning to walk, and Uncle Frank was cooking. And he burned his hand on the grill, and Mom went into the house to get him some ice or something. She was gone for maybe 10 seconds, but that was all the time it took you to fall in. I was the only one in the pool, so I... I tried to save you, Ben. I just wasn't strong enough. I felt so alone and just helpless, you know? I mean, Mom... Mom pulled us out, but right now, Ben, right now, I... I feel so helpless and alone. And Mom's not here to pull us out. Angela, we're fine. You... you honestly don't have to worry about me. Ben, you don't look so good. I'm going to go talk to the doctors. You don't have to do that. You know what they're gonna say. I'll be back. Hey. Come on. What the hell? Well, thank you for coming, but you didn't have to come all this way. Jerry? I think I already have. I mean, I've gotten better at a lot of different things. Thank you for the cookies. Seora, Seora! Fuck, do you want some of this? No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. It's you little bastards doing this to me. I know it. Hey, Ben. Chente, where did you come from? I heard that the medicine wasn't working good, so I brought you some new stuff, expensive stuff. Thanks. Jerry. Jerry? You all right, man? Dude, you all right? Jerry? Happy birthday, Ben. Ben. Angela? Angela. I know I said I was feeling fine, but there is some serious shit going on here. Angela, are you ok? Ben, I, I... I don't know what to do. The... the bills, they're... they're stacking up. Chente, he feels horrible about what happened. I... he stopped working, Ben. He's not going to work anymore. I... I... I don't know what to do. I just... I... I don't know what to do. I... I... I don't think I can do this anymore, Ben. Just tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it. I just want you to wake up, Ben. Just wake up. Ben! Wake up! Ben, just wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Ben! Wake up. I have your medicine. Ben, I don't know what to say. You can't know how terrible I feel. Hey, Ben, sorry it took me so long to stop by. I, brought you these flowers. Make this place a little homier. No. No. Happy birthday, Ben. Well done, Bennie. I thought I was going to lose you there for a minute. Who the hell are you? Such hostility, Bennie. Your father would be so proud of you. What did you say? Black, it's so hard to keep clean, Bennie. How do I get out of here? Simple, you leave. How? You're asking me how to leave a place that you built? What do you mean, a place that I built? Look, Bennie, I... I think we're getting ahead of ourselves a little bit here. Let's take it back a couple days. ok, when did things start getting... how should I put this... weird? What is all of this? Well, everything you perceive as your reality really is your reality. ok, all of this, it's kind of like falling asleep with the TV on. You're just painting these pictures with your mind, based on what you hear around you... the conversations when people come to visit you, the sounds of the man screaming in the bed next to you. Rargh, you get the idea, Bennie. You see. I really can be helpful if you let me, but here's the thing. People will go on with their lives. Bills will be paid, and love will be made. Meanwhile, everyone forgets all about little Bennie and the bump on his head. They always forget, Bennie. Then what am I supposed to do? Everything that exists here is inside of you. You've just ignored it for so long that what happens here, it feels like someone else's nightmare, but this is your nightmare, Bennie. There are no outside elements, only what you observe those elements to be. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you can wake yourself up. Who the hell are you? Well, I'm everything you've ever read, everything you've ever seen, touched, tasted, heard, or learned. That, Bennie, is who I am. No, buddy, a freaking whack job is who you are. Doctora, Doctora! Why do I have a feeling that doesn't lead to heaven? What is this? Your way home. Look. You don't understand. If you... Help me, please. No, please. Damn it, Bennie. I didn't want this for you. Your mother is a lying whore. I'm the innocent one. Please, stop! Please, no, please. I'm sorry. You haven't thought of this in a long time. Why would I want to? You can't pretend it didn't happen, Bennie. Don't give me that bullshit. It's your fear that makes him strong. It's like a darkness that infects you. You confronted him once. And for what? A dead mother and a damaged head. How do I get out of here? This is yours to control. Screw this. Piss off! Mine to control. Ben, bro... Long time. I... I'm sorry, bro. You know, when I lost my job, I... I just feel like I needed to get away, you know? I've been a bad friend. Here you are, lying in bed, while I'm up north, smoking weed. It's good to see you, Jerry. It's good to see you, Ben. What do we do now? What have we got here, brother? No. That's a pretty lady. Jerry, stay in the car. Don't worry. I'm gonna stay right here. You got this, bro. No, no. No. No! Hey! Seorita. Yes, I am now. I didn't get your name. Ben, and yours? You don't know who I am? No, ma'am, I don't. I am Jubilee, and I'm not a ma'am. Well, all right. Jerry. Yes? This is Jubilee. Hi, Jerry. My. Hi, Jubilee. Listen, man, we're gonna be giving her a ride home. -You want to hop in the back? -Yeah, yeah. Hey, I'm here in town for a while. I'm actually an actress, and I'm filming a movie. An actress? Well, sorta, I mean, no one knows who I am outside Latin America, but even a Mexican movie is something to see. We're filming tomorrow in the park downtown. Do you know it? We start at 8 in the morning, but don't come until 10 or so. Nothing interesting happens until then. Ok. Shit. What are you doing? Still here. Bennie, ju... just stop. You're... you're wasting time. You said this world was mine to control. I want you gone. I'm an exception. I'm part of you. Whatever, man. Have you even considered trying to get out of the situation that you're in? I've been busy. Yeah, busy, playing Jackie Chan and manufacturing a new car. I hate the bus. And now a dream girl? What's wrong with any of that? You think she would ever actually talk to you? This whole thing is a big soap opera you're trying to produce. You said I had free reign here. I never said that. Look. Just... will you just let me enjoy this for a second? In this world, a second, it could be a minute in the real world. An hour could be a day, sometimes a week, depending, and the farther you get into this world, the harder it is to get out, the easier it is to forget about little Bennie. Don't worry about it, boss. I got it covered. And cut the Bennie shit. At Christmas, my mom will make our neighbor dress up like Santa Claus... him or Elvis. Really? And one time, my mom had our neighbor dress up like Elvis, dressed up as Santa. A Santa Elvis impersonator? An ideal man, what can I say? So the movie shooting seems like it's going well. I have something that I've been putting off telling you. Tomorrow is the last day. What? I should have said something. It's just that I've been having such a great time with you, and... Then what? I don't know. I guess I will go back to Mexico City, or maybe I will hang out here a couple more days. So I was thinking about your offer the other night, about staying around a couple of days after you finish shooting, and I thought that maybe we could get away for a couple of days, maybe go to the beach and get some rest. Seth called me this morning. I got an offer to do another movie. That's great. In London, it's the role of a lifetime, Ben. It's my first chance to get noticed outside of Mexico. The director saw me on a cell phone commercial, and he called Seth. Don't take it. What? I know that we haven't known each other for very long, but I can barely remember what my life was like before I met you the other night. If you leave now, I'm not sure we'll ever have this back. This role is a dream for me, Ben, and besides, we hardly know each other. Exactly, and as soon as you leave, you'll forget all about little Ben and his mediocre life. Ben. If you take that role, Jubilee, you will regret it. I have to get to set. Of course, walk away. You're not being fair to me. Stop being a child. I'm not being fair? This is my life. This is my fantasy. You're supposed to be doing what I want. Whatever, we'll talk about this later. No, please. Get down! Jubilee. Jubilee. Man, how did I mess this up? Well, I mean, probably by yelling at her, and then you tackled her to the ground. And then you scared the shit out of her, right out. Bro, bro, you need to just talk to her. Tell her you're dumb ass is sorry. I don't know, man. She wouldn't even talk to me. Sh... ok, y'all can't end like this, all right? I mean, she's your dream girl, man. Too bad you ain't the man of hers. -Jerry, wait. -Bro. -What? -Damn. I said, too bad you're not the man of her dreams. -What are you doing? -Thanks, Jerry. What the hell? Bro's weird. My gosh. It's not supposed to be like this. Jubilee, you... you didn't get on the plane. Seth called me and told me you came to set dressed like an evil Santa Elvis. I had see for myself. Ben. I'm so sorry for everything, for... for trying to control everything and for... Stop, stop, stop. I was being selfish. I want you to take that role. No, it's not important. It is important. It's important to you. I want you to take it. Only if you have a spot next to me. Come to London? Man, I needed to get out of that jumpsuit. It kept riding up my crack. Hey, let's go buy the tickets. What was that? I don't know. Jubilee! Ben. Jubilee. Always in the way, Bennie. So when were you gonna introduce me to your girlfriend? She smells good. No! Tastes good, too... no doubt in my mind, Ben, she's a keeper. No. No. What are you doing here, Ben, you little shit? Are you trying to be a man? Did you forget how that worked out for you last time, Bennie Boo Boo? Come here. Now, where did we leave off? Bennie, Bennie... Bennie, please, help me. No. Get her out of here. Do we have to do this every time? You ruined my life. Not bad, tiger. That was cute, you pathetic little shit. You know what I can't believe? I can't believe I spawned such worthless shit. You can't get rid of me, Ben. I made you who you are... a brain-dead, retarded, little boy, too stupid to be loved. Jubilee, are you ok? Are you ok? Go. Get out of here. Go, go. Mom, Mom, I'm so sorry. Come on! Come on. Come on. Glad you decided to come to this place, Bennie. It'll be good for you once we dissect your mother and your precious, little whore. Help me decide. Help me decide. Which piece? Which piece first? Cute, boy, what do you think you're doing? Get out of here, Ma. All my life, you told me I was shit, and I hated you for it. Now I see that you're nothing. I'm not afraid of you anymore. What, you think this is over? This will never be over! I own you. I own your fear. Where are you going? What are you doing? I'm getting rid of this. Ben! Ben! Ben! I knew you had it in you, Bennie... sorry, Ben. It's time to go home. I'm staying here. But this is what you wanted. This isn't what I wanted. Really? This whole world was yours to control, and at the moment you needed to, you stopped your father. You knew couldn't come here without a... a reason. Jubilee is what you needed to come here. No. She helped you remember the one thing you had spent your whole life trying to forget. You did it, Ben, and now it's time to go home. This is the life that I want. This isn't real. It's real to me. Ben, the suitcase. -Right. -The suitcase! Where is it? It is behind the... Where is it? It's behind the... behind the couch. Right. Ben! Want to meet your son? He's beautiful. He's got your nose. Ben. Ben? Baby, are you all right? Doctor. Ben, baby, what's wrong, baby? Baby? Hey, hey, take it easy. Ben, what's wrong, baby? No, no, no, Ben, Ben, hey. Baby, Ben, no, come on, baby. Don't do this to me. Stop. No, Ben, come on. I need you. Ben, no, stop. Ben, no, I'm talking to you, Ben. Please, don't go, baby. Ben, please.
