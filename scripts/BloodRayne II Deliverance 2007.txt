Deliverance, Mr. Piles, is not just some small town waiting for the railway to pass through to give it some sense of life. No, no, no, Deliverance is the epitome of the American Dream. It is not some Sin City of libations and fornication. It is the heart of all future prosperity. When that railroad comes through, we are not simply building a train station. We are building a whole railroad service yard. We're gonna mine coal in those hills. We have found a seam of coal that is so wide you could drive... Mr. Mayor, I have some questions. Yes, please, Mr. Piles. I am happy to answer any question you have, just go right ahead. I came looking for wild stories of the Wild West. - Things like that. - Yes, certainly Well, Mr. Piles, I'm afraid you'll find Deliverance a lot less wild than you've been lead to believe. - Finished? - Mm-hmm. Dad, can you read us a story? Why don't you go pick one out, all right? Dad will be in in five minutes. Okay. That's good. It's late in the season for this much snow. We read that yesterday. You know, that snow's gonna turn to mud. Just like the got down in the city. It might be June before we can start planting. We'll make do. We always find a way. Goddamn bear's back! Be careful. We're gonna figure this out. Let's read that. What was that? Vince? You two stay put. Vince? All right, get under the bed. Get under. Are you sad, children? Do you miss your mother and father already? Don't worry. You'll join them soon enough. No, no, no! Let go of me! Ow! William! So the railway's coming to Deliverance. The man said it, and it's true. Uh, Sheriff, if you and Sadie want to spend the night, I got a free bed for you. Well, I appreciate the offer. But my lady Sadie here prefers her own bed at night. All right. Bid you good night. Easy. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Why don't you go on and check on the little ones? I'll-I'll finish up down here. Okay? All right. Good night. Good night, folks. Lock up tight, you hear? With all that's been going on, best be careful. All right, Sheriff. Sheriff, evening. Night, Mayor. Night, Sheriff. Aren't you cashing in your chips a little early leaving tomorrow? Look, Mayor, if I don't find the "wild" in the West soon, my paper's gonna cut me lose. Yeah. Deliverance is about the quietest town on the frontier. That's an understatement. When that rail service comes in next week, there'll be a whole lot more going on. Well, I can't wait that long. Hmph. You better be sleeping. What's wrong? We- we saw somebody outside. What? Unh! Aah! Please... don't hurt my children! I'll do anything. Mom, please! Anything! That's what I'm counting on. Sally! No! Please leave them alone! That's far enough! This here is a good town. And I'm the law here, young fella. Get your hands off of me! Now you let those children go this damned instant! You let the children go! Now... you drop those guns. I said drop them! Aah! I am Franklin Holden, Mayor of... My house is at your disposal. Excuse me, sir. My name is Newton Piles. I'm with the Chicago Chronicle. I'm writing stories about the West. Tell me, Mr... Piles. Is telling stories your reason to live? hosseinmovies@gmail. com Then bear witness to the greatest story ever told.  Bernadette? Bernadette! Vince! Bernadette! William! Jessie! You better have something interesting to say, mister. Easy now. The young'uns ain't here. I can see that. Where are they? My guess is they're with Billy the Kid and his gang. Never seen him take prisoners before though. That ain't the work of no bandits. Billy the Kid, he ain't no bandit. He ain't even human. He's some sort of... some sort of creature. A creature of the night. Now you mind putting that pig sticker away now? Please? Look-hey, easy. He's been real busy. These folk... they kin to you? As close as it gets for me. Where did he brings those children? If they're alive, I'm betting they're in Deliverance. Say... seeing how you and I have... similar interests here... maybe you and I should think about teaming up. I ride alone. Hey, there's gonna be an awful lot of those bloodsuckers. A woman alone won't be able to handle it by herself. Your fly's open. Now hold up there, Missy. You discharge a single round from your weapons in my town, you, me, and Sadie here will be having ourselves a conversation. Now if you're a pretty lady looking for some work, we got ourselves some nice business folk who pass through here. And the railroad line's coming soon. Might want to get a pretty dress. Have yourself a bath. And do you hair up real nice-like. You talk to Martha over at the Pig. She'll point you in the right direction. And I might even drop in and pay you a visit myself. Keep an eye on her. With pleasure. I think I'm going to enjoy this.  Hey, hey, hey, I'm telling you I've been chasing that son of a bitch for six months. And there he was. I sees him clear as day! Hey, hey, hey. Thank you. Go on, sweet thing, go on! Ha ha ha ha! Anyway... I sees him as clear as day. And I says, "I don't care who thinks "this cocksucker is as dangerous "as folks say he is. "I don't care nothing about how many men they say he shot. " The only thing I plum care about is where I got my gun aimed. Both barrels aimed right at him I had. And then I tells him, "When you see the Devil, you tell him Flintlock Hogan sent you. " Oh! I shot that cocksucker good! Now he closer to the Devil hisself. Bravo! Bravo! Ooh-wee! Mm! Only two things a woman is good for. Making my grub and... keeping my dick warm. You say the sweetest things. Oh, there's plenty of sweet stuff where that came from, honey. Mm-mm! Yeah! Unh! Aah! Flintlock Hogan. You're crushing my windpipe. You reckon I'd give up looking for you? Last time I saw you... you interrupted a good game. How about you let me finish this time? We can even deal you in. We don't mind taking your money. Oh, come on, baby, what you say, huh? Unh! Come on. I'll take that. More whiskey Come on, fill it up. I must have a four-leaf clover shoved right up my arse. You all may as well fold now and count your losses. Otherwise Irish Mick is gonna send you all home crying to your mamas. You sound funny. I'm an Irishman, darling. Don't you know what an Irishman sounds like? A cross between an asshole and a dead man. Oome on, Mick, just play your fucking cards. Patience is a virtue, Mr. Hogan. Full fucking house. What you got? I got that beat. Four Aces. Bejesus! Would you look at that? You can add that to your list a what a woman's good for. Oocksucking cheating bitch! Oome on! Ain't it like an Irishman to bring a bottle to a gunfight. I just had enough of this shit. Back down, Kentucky. This is between me and the little cunt. Let's go, Rayne. Let's settle this outside. Let's go, Rayne! I'm done messing around with you! Come on! Go get the Sheriff pronto. That's more like it. Miss... you don't know what you're dealing with. Then that's fair... 'cause neither do they. Oh, Rayne, you know I'm the best cocksucking shooter God's America ever spat into existence. Shit, I done killed 17 men since last I saw you. And I counting Ohinamen and Injuns. What are you looking for, some sort of prize? Prepare to meet your maker, bitch. Uh, your safety, Mr. Piles. Oh, finally the Wild West. What the fuck?! A bad reaction to some bullets and some holy water and some garlic. God bless his soul. If bullshit were music, you'd be a bleeding brass band! Now I have had about enough of all this. Reskin those pistols, gentlemen. I've got this. See this here scattergun? I've done killed over 30 men with this little lady. Now we've got some rules in this town. And if there is one thing that Sadie don't like, is people breaking them. The boss don't like it much neither. Prepare the gallows! We're having ourselves a hanging! Now... you've got till high midnight to make your peace and think about what you've done here. Told you not to piss Sadie off. Perhaps you could put in a good word for her? Ma'am? Ma'am? Over here. Hi. Most impressive for the fairer sex. Bravo! Bravo! I'm Newton Piles. I'm with the Chicago Chronicle. I'm here writing stories for the East Ooast. You know, true tales of the new frontier, straight from the line. Tales of blood and- I was just wondering if I could interview you. You know, for the folks back at home. Who's the boss holed up at the end of the street? The fella who sent me to find out who you are. I had not choice. Billy the Kid? He got any kids with him? What's he up to? Ma'am, I really couldn't tell you. Oan't or won't? Uh, he doesn't share his plans with me. I write what he wants me to write and I do what he wants me to do. He's growing an army. Why are you so interested in him anyway, lady? Seems to me you've got your own problems right now. Got my reasons. Such as? My reasons are my own. Oh! Don't worry about this little snitch. He won't be taking any of this back. - Yes, that's right! - Yeah, uh-huh. Oh! You're a Brimstone. That mean something to you? Around the neck. Shoot! Name's Rayne. I'd shake your hand, but- I understand. I'm Muller. I take it you're not here by accident. No, I've been tracking Billy clear from Cheyenne. Something weren't quite right about him. How's he like as a gunfighter? Truth be told, he's not much of a hand with a gun. He don't need to be. He take bullets like a boxer takes punches. Are you saying he heals himself? It's the damnedest thing. He don't even need to feed on blood to heal himself. He must be one old vampire. He's the strongest I've ever seen. He's smart too. He's got leadership abilities. Hell, I admire the son of a bitch. Let's see if we can get you more comfortable. Here, let me get these. Let me see your glasses. Aah, be careful! I just bought those! What's this about building up an army? Well, we saw that he was coming in and attacking the homesteads. Collecting new recruits out of men unless they put up too much of a fight. Left the women and kids dead. How many men he turn? I figure he's got Uh, excuse me. Turn them? Vampire bites a man, he'll turn into a vampire himself. Unless they rip his throat out in the process. Wasn't until they took over this town that we saw what he was doing. Do you mind? You're in my light. Who's we? Me and my partner. He was a Brimstone. He rode off to get some others. His head come back in a mailbag. I don't know how they knew. They got me on account of being his partner. You ever figure out what they were up to? Well, the railroad's coming to town next week, right? Damn it, do you mind giving me some space?! I'm sorry, I'm just not very good at this. Of course. As soon the rail service comes to this outpost, hundreds of people will be coming in. And going out vampires. I figure he'll start here. He'll build his army and then he'll go out west, growing stronger as he goes. But until the rail service begins, he needs to keep things looking normal. So that's why he took all those kids hostage! That and so they have something to feed on while they wait. Hey. They're, ahem, almost finished setting up the gallows. Well, it looks like it's the end of the line for us. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Aren't you gonna put up a fight? And what do you propos e we do, newspaperman? You gonna help us? Well, I'm flattered, but I'm more an observer. A man who hangs in the shadows and does nothing is the worst kind of man. Isn't that right, Rayne? Enough! Both of you. If we're gonna do something, we gotta do it now. What do you want me to do? You got any weapons? I got your swords. These drunk cowboys traded 'em to me for a bottle of whiskey. I'm an objective party. You're Billy's lapdog. Folks out there are scared to do anything. Now from what I can see, you're our last hope. It's show time! Oh, shit. Unlock 'em. What are you doing here, Bob? I came to see if they, uh, wanted anything special for their burial. We're gonna dumping them in the marsh. if that addresses any of your concerns. Open it. Oome on. Oome on, let's go, Muller. Oome on! We are gonna test the gallows with you, my friend. So's you can be an example to the townsfolk, sweet cheeks. Eeny, meany, miny... moe. No! Oome. Aah! No, no! Aah! Watch. Shh! hosseinmovies@gmail. com Hush, little baby, don't say a word  Billy's going to buy you a mockingbird  And if that mockingbird don't sing  Ahh. So pretty. So pretty. Oome on, boy. Get him up there! Jesus, calm down, boy! Hold still, hold still. Unh. All right, everybody, quiet! Any last words? Y'all better pray we never meet again. Not much chance of that. Hang him! Go get the main attraction. Oome on. Oome on! Sheriff... what do you need me here for? 'Oause, Mr. Mayor, you are the face of this town. And as the face of this town, it's only proper that you be involved in the handing out of justice. And it 'cause gives me a hard-on to see you shitting your pants! Who's ready for another hanging? Well, I think you should do the honors. - Me? - Read! For the crime of... Speak up, goddamn it. Don't be shy. For the crime of causing a ruckus, assaulting officers of the law, and murder most foul on three counts... William. Get on with it! Let's hang the bitch. Yeah, do it! I declare you should be hung by the neck until dead. Dead. Dead. Well said! Get on with this! Fuck, yeah! Rayne! Is this a friend of yours? What the hell? Son of a bitch. Rayne! You will not disob- Unh! Shoot her! Let's go get her. Oome on! Hee-ya! Very brave, little bartender. What do you want? Your life. Unh. Oome. Get back inside. She's gotta be around here somewheres. Come on, over here! Looks like you could use a friend. Be no goddamn railroad in Deliverance. I just burnt down a railroad station. Oome on now. Just take a little bit. A little bit, a little bit. There you go. You sure don't make friends easy, do you? I saw you kill three of those suckers last night. Not bad for a night's work. Still a ways to go. Yeah, well, you're not going anywhere today. Or tonight. Or next week for that matter. That's too long. Woman, you're lucky to be breathing. You got hit a couple of times when you were in the water. B- Blood. Yeah. You lost a lot. No, I need... blood. What? Blood will help me heal. You're a vampire? What kind of vampire can walk around in the daylight and cross through water? Dhampir, half-human. I didn't know such a thing was possible. So what does that mean? Your mom- Raped... by a vampire. Animal blood works, but human blood is better. How much do you need? As much... Unh. There you go. That's it. That's it. Enough, enough, enough! Enough! Goddamn, woman. You could've put it in a cup. Yeah, maybe next time we'll put in a cup, right. Rayne! I picked these up in Deliverance. Thanks. Try to hang on to them next time. Unh. Well, that looks a lot better. You know, I think we're gonna need some help. A couple extra guns would be pretty handy, you know. Yeah, you got any in mind? Yep, I do. Oome on, Joe, this way. Back it up. Thatta, boy. Let me guess. God? Not exactly. Friend of yours? Not yet. Your goal is to be shaped by his goodness. Or will you end up in the burning fires of hell! Oh, I hear those voices. Those sickly, perverted voices... that whisper... psst psst psst.. and mock... ha ha ha! But those are the flapping, wagging, cursed tongues of sodomites! Yes! Let fear grip you. Let it grip you by your intestines and pull you kicking and screaming to the light! For fear is the way of the Lord, Our Savior. Fear is what will keep the darkness from you door. The darkness that tempts and seeks to lure the righteous from the pathway to paradise. Paradise, I tell thee. Paradise, be not the sweet nectar found in the bottom of a bottle. Paradise be not the moist, swollen lips between a virgin's thighs. No, paradise be the opening of your filthy hearts and your sinful minds to the glory of Our Lord and Savior. Repent, I tell thee! Repent your filthy and heathen ways, or condemn yourself to damnation and sodomy in the cruel fires of Hell. Now I bring you salvation right there. And I bring you forgiveness right there. Yes, together there is still time for that. But you should know... that forgiveness... Forgiveness does not come cheap. Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right! Donate all that you have to God and his glorious heavenly kingdom. It is the only way to be sure of your space in paradise when the end is upon you. Thank you very much. Pass it around. Now there you go. See? Was it so hard to repent? I don't know whether or laugh or cry. Way I see it, you got three options. One, we put them wanted posters up and let the townsfolk fit you with a rope. Or two... we spare them the trouble and hang your ourselves. Or three... you join us in our good works and redeem your soul. What will it be? Well, what kind of good work are we talking about there, my lady? Ridding the world of all the heathen vampire scum. Well, hell, why didn't you just say so? No one's gonna hang a fella for taking money, right? Yeah. I got time to get my hat. All right, let's go. That was easy. Thank you, Jesus. You boys better wait out here. We don't want to get our man overexcited by all the company. Oh, I think he's gonna be excited enough to see you. Rayne, you watch yourself in there. This is a hard character you're dealing with. Now why else would I want to be soliciting his company? Where the hell you going? I'm going inside. You coming? No, I don't have any money. Here, my treat. Thank you, Jesus. Hurry up with that whiskey, would you, woman? Get in here! Heh heh! Whiskey! Is that Franson inside? Think so. I'm the name of the Lord, I'm here to exorcise my demons. Yeah! Oome on, I'll you touch my Bible. Now howdy! Oh, wow! You one of Hannah's girls? - Maybe. - Yeah. Mm-hmm! Look at you! Oh! Mm! Mm! I don't know where to start, the top or the bottom. Lord! Ha! I'm gonna give you the ride of your life. Oh! You're one of those, are you? Well, all right! Oh! I'm one of those too. I bet you are. Oh! I can't move. That's the point. That's good! Yeah! Now... I have a proposition for you. I want your undivided attention. Listen close. You don't want to blow this. Did I kill one of your friends or your kin? Neither. We want you to kill for us. Who? More like what. What? Vampires. You with us? Yeah! Are you still gonna fuck me? Oh, Preacher, yeah! Hallelujah!  Got something here gonna be real helpful. An offering. No. No, silver bullets rubbed with garlic. Tools of our trade. Nice. A man after my own heart. Preacher, we need a blessing. Well, shit, yeah, I'd be honored. Um... Dear Lord in Heaven, we are gathered here on this eve with our souls laid bare. We ask you, God, to give us mercy when the time for sacrifice falls upon us. They've roamed the earth for thousands of years. Feeding on the meek, the impoverished. They've forsaken God, and God has forsaken their victims. For the people of Deliverance, mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, it is for them that we do this. In dark bonded as brothers are we. By this we solemnly swear. For there are none but us who care. As one we stand together, we fight together and we die together. Yeah! Thanks! Franklin, please. There must be something we can do. My children are out there. Martha, the Devil makes haste. It is my belief that... Billy is simply using our children in order to control us. Were any harm to befall them, he would not have the same leverage over our decisions. He's gonna wait until the railroad comes through and take as many lives as he can to feed his bloodlust. However, if someone were to tell him that the railroad is no longer traveling through our fair village, he would leave. God may soul, I will tell him that lie. I will parley with him. I will am confident... we will prevail. We just sit here? Until the time is right. Mr. Mayor... I know it's not my place. I'm-I'm just a bystander, but... he's gonna see right through that. Mr. Piles, though I be only a mayor of a small town in the West, I do believe I know something of the nature of people and those that are not but take their appearance. He is filled with the lust for blood. It is all he cares about. He will hear what he wants to hear, and he move toward his objectives and his aims. It is my responsibility. It's a bad idea. Look, she's back. And she's brought help. Let me see. Billy the Kid! The Brimstone is calling you out! You hear that? What? Exactly. And the burning fires of Hell rained down upon them. Woo! Oome on out, you coward! Unh! So, hey, how come they call you Slime Bag? They call me Slime Bag? Yeah. Let's go. What, you couldn't go under? I'm going out there. Martha, I do believe Mary and Sally would be better off with a mother who's alive, not six feet under. No, no! You seem to have to have your hands full. I think we should go out there. We should go out- What's the matter with you people? You're a bunch of cowards! Those men out there. They're putting their lives on the line for your people. For you and your children, and all you can do is just stand here? That's why Billy has control of Deliverance! Because this town is filled with a bunch of- Mr. Piles, do you know how to use that? Well, what are you waiting for? Waiting to be slaughtered like cattle at an abattoir so this demon spawn can drain you? Unh! Mm. Ripened on the vine. And ready to pluck. You don't want them Billy. You want me. Pick on somebody your own size. Billy the Kid. Bullying the other little kids, huh? Let it go, Rayne. Release. Then perhaps... we can share a meal together. Taste sweet... young blood... on your lips... again. Hmm? You don't want to fuck with me, Billy! Your children are out there. There may not be much future for this town, but there's no future at all without children. Aaron, two boys. Percy, you got a little girl, don't you? Well, then... with me? Where the fuck did he go? Jesus titty-fuck Ohrist. Drop those gun belts real slow-like. You shouldn't smoke. You shouldn't cuss. You are outmanned and outgunned, you dirty dog bastards. Yeah, well, let's even up those odds then. Your men are dead. This town, my pantry, is almost dry. But... in a few day... the railroad will come opening the rest of the country to my grasp. I shall beget an army. And it shall spread along these train tracks like the blood in the iron veins of this land until nothing stands before my will. Embrace what you are. Join me. Ugh. Rule at my side. Get your hands off me. Yeah? Yeah. Turn around, you yellow dog bastards! Aah! Aah! hosseinmovies@gmail. com Well, Mr. Piles... I'd like to show you the main street... of Deliverance. Unh! Hear me, sinners. You will be dead before the night is done. You are no longer welcome in Deliverance! Unh! Ohh. Oh, God, did you see that? Did you see that? I can't do this by myself! Preacher! William, run! Oome on, guys. No guns. I want to feel... skin. Oh, now we play. You're all done, Preacher. You should not have done that. Suck lead. Unh! Unh! I always enjoy a little sport before a meal. It's whets the appetite. It gets the juices flowing. I must confess to being a little giddy at my first taste of Dhampir. I'm not as sweet as look. Well, then we should make the meat more tender. Unh! I offered you greatness. Unh! I offered you history at my side. And you threw it all away for these animals. For these sheep! Aah! Is this your shepherd? Huh, my little flock? Is this is the one who has made your puny hearts bold with hope? Good. The taste of despair is so much sweeter when it's torn from the cradle of faith. And now... now the slaughter begins! You whined when I took your children. Now you will watch as I drain them. Weep as they die and curse your God as they rise from the dead to rip open your throats at my command! Now does the slaughter begin. Billy! Let's do something about that nasty laugh of yours. Yargh! Unh! Back up! Big speech, small guns. You overcompensating for something? I'm sick of your half-breed mouth. Good-bye. Mary! Mommy! Mary! Oh, Mary! Mom! Let me see. Are you all right? Mommy, Sally didn't make it. I know, sweetheart. I know. Damn! What a story. What a story! The true tale of how the West was won. What do you think, Mr. Garrett? It's got intrigue. It's got secrets- You know, I thought you had a new job. Sheriff, isn't it? Yeah, I'm the Sheriff now. So what's next? I'm riding out to Tombstone. Heard they got themselves some trouble with some vampires by the name of the Olanton Gang. Yeah, I heard about that. Wyatt Earp's after 'em. Maybe I'll ride along? Newton, life is like a penis. When it's hard, you get screwed. When it's soft, you can't beat it. I gotta write that down. hosseinmovies@gmail. com
