Well, the mill is going to close. We lost our last contract on Friday. I don't really have any choice. So how long have we got? It'll be the end of the month. It's a very generous redundancy package. You're just giving up on the town, are ya? We've explored every possible option. There's no way out. What about old Dave? He's 61 years old. What's he supposed to do? It's never too late to start again. You should hang your head in shame! Shame on you, nielson! Look, this mill has been in my family for well over 100 years. I do understand your shock. I'm sorry. We'll all just have to try and hold our heads up high and move on. What's it been - 15, 16 years? You know, I don't remember. Different place, now your father's shut the mill down. Where's everyone moving to? Depends on where they can get jobs. Yeah. Your dad said you got married. Yeah. Yeah, I did. You got kids yet? No. No, no kids. Tables here, dance floor down there. - Yes. - Now, what have you decided about the lights? - They'll rig this... - Now, do you think that this floor is a little bit uneven? - I don't think so. - Slippery though, right? Now, we've decided no with the ribbons. Flowers are going to be here, but tomorrow... - Christian! - Hi. It's lovely to meet you. It's lovely to meet you too. Come on, I'll show you to your room. I have an appointment with the florist in ten. You probably want to settle in anyway. It's been hectic here this week. Christian? I know this might be a bit weird for you, and I just wanted to say, I really appreciate you coming, and I know that it means a lot to your father. Good flight? Yeah, it was fine. You hungry? I'll make you a sandwich. Since when do you make sandwiches? I've always made sandwiches! I've never once seen you make a sandwich. You got everything you need in the bedroom? Yes. I guess that's one of the advantages of marrying your housekeeper. - Very funny. - How old is she? She's 31. Is she really? - Really? - Yeah. - Oh, my god! - - Christian no, I mean, she could be your daughter. So is grace not coming? She had a few meetings she couldn't get out of. - When's she getting here? - Wednesday. Take the Volvo. Ask Peterson to give you the keys. You've still got mom's car? Why wouldn't I? I'm going to go for a walk. Anna's putting on a special dinner for you. Don't be late. A mate of mine's a manager of a steel mill up north. I'll give him a call. Charlotte's job will tide you over. Who knows if there'll still be a school? - They won't shut the school. - Without kids left to teach? Jesus. I'll see you at the pub, then? Nah, I've got to head down to the science competition. Of course, yeah. Best of luck to hedvig, eh? Thanks, mate. Are we still good for tomorrow? Yeah, dad said we can borrow his boat, so we're on. I'm looking forward to it. It'll be a nice distraction. - We bloody need one. - See you, mate. So I've researched amino acids as part of my science project, particularly focusing on the amino acids in the human body and also in the food and drink industry. Um, so this is a skeleton diagram of an amino acid, which I connected to a nitrogen atom, which is here, silver. Then we... That's then in turn connected to the Alpha carbon atom. Ah, so, yeah. That's it. Thanks for listening to my presentation. The standard of the whole day has been very, very high. Hi. - How'd you go? - She was great. I stumbled over my presentation. I'm sure it was great. - Hey. - Did you hear? Kate told me. I'm sorry, baby. We'll talk about it later. - Hedvig. - Hedvig, it's you! - Hedvig? - Yeah! Told you so. Whoo, yeah! Hedvig! Yeah! Hang on a sec. I'm just going to grab my stuff from the classroom. Still think they should have given you first prize. - Shut up, dad! - Just saying. - Hey, guys. - Adam. - Hey, mr Finch. - Adskis. What's up, man? How was practice? It was good. I scored two 3-pointers. - Cool. - Totes, totes. - Hedvig got second prize... - Dad! I wouldn't bring it up. She's a bit embarrassed about it. - Yeah? - Show him your certificate. - Check it. - Yeah, awesome. - Do you want to hang out? - Yeah, man. Let's do it. Yeah, I do. - Can you take that? - Yeah, whatevs. - I'll see you later. - See you later. See you, man. Two 3-pointers, man - that's gnarly. Yeah, thanks. It's gnarly! Say no to drugs. Oliver? What? Banksy is, like, the most famous street artist in the world! Like, he tags all these warehouses and stuff. He's pretty good. Adam! You've got to see this. What is it? You have an unfair advantage. Whoo-hoo! - Can I have my bike back? - Nope! What, you giving up? This place is awesome. Come on! Are you seriously going to make me chase you again? If you catch me, you can kiss me. You know what? I'm tapping out. Well, lamb chops are discounted. It's going to be a nightmare for hedvig's exams if we've got to move. We should wait till the end of the year, at least. - Money's going to get tight. - We'll figure something out. Fucking hell! - What? - It's Christian! - Who? - Hey! - Hey! - My god! Is that all you've got to say for yourself? - When did you get in? - I got in this morning. - No phone call? - I was about to call you. - What are you doing tonight? - I'm meant to be... Come over for dinner. Hi. This is my wife, Charlotte. Charlotte, this is my old friend, Christian. - It's so nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. He's Henry's son. He's been overseas. I haven't been home for awhile. He's coming for dinner tonight. I don't want to be any trouble. - We're having chops. - Chops. - Ow. - Oh, shit! - Sorry! Sorry, sorry. - It's ok, it's alright. You know what? Let's just wait till tomorrow, alright? Ok. We'll do it on your birthday. Ok. Tomorrow. Going somewhere? My dad told me never to get in cars with strangers. Yeah, right. He sounds like a pretty smart guy. - How'd she go? - She blitzed it. - Second prize. - You beauty! - You went to school with dad? - I did. Dad, you remember Christian, don't you? - Mr Finch. - Henry's son. I taught you how to play football. That's right. - You still rubbish? - Dad! - Well, he was. - Come on, Christian. He's back in town for his dad's wedding. Henry's getting married again? You know that, dad. I told you. We've been invited. He's a little... you know. So what was dad like as a kid? - Don't tell her anything. - Was he naughty? - About average. - What did he get up to? Um, no comment. - Good man. - You know, though, your dad was the golden boy back in school. - What? - He was just like you. He won all the prizes, topped the state in three subjects. Isn't that right, Oliver? - Can't remember. - Why did you never tell me? Let's just get this dinner going. That's where she gets her brains. Definitely not where she got her looks. - Hedvig? - Yeah? We got a new friend today. - Really? - Not another one, dad. - Come have a look. - Want to see something cool? - What's that? - Grandad's forest. - His forest? - Yeah. Can we show him? - Dinner will be ready soon. - Please? Alright. You've got t minus 20 minutes. So you're American. I'm not sure. How can you not be sure? Well, my mother was American. My parents met in New York City. And I just moved around a lot when I was young. Then my father decided I should come back here and go to school. I wish I was born somewhere else. Yeah, everyone does. So everything worked out for you, hey? Yeah, man. It was touch and go for awhile there. But you're happy? Fuck, yeah. Yeah, I think so. Hedvig is a great girl. She's the best thing in my life. She is. They're all animals we've been given, or we found them injured. There's a lot left to do. Just making a new pond for the birds. We're kind of like an unofficial rspca. Ah, there she is. Give her some bread. Hello! Hi. Hey, come here. It's alright. Sh, sh, sh. Hello. I'm hedvig. Hey! Hey. It's ok. It's ok, it's ok. Oh. What happened to her? Henry shot her down. Peterson saved her. My father shot that duck down? Yeah. Must be losing his touch. Is she going to be ok? I don't know. I don't know if she'll fly again. Left wing's all buggered up. Walter seems to be doing fine. I don't know. He hasn't really been the same since he got out of jail. But your dad's been really generous. - Has he? - He has. He gave Walter a pension. He helped us buy this house. You know, I didn't know that. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's not the life I expected when I was 19, and fuck knows what happens now I'm out of a job, but... I'm lucky. I know that. Do you think that he's trying to avoid me? Of course not. I don't think that he likes me very much. What's not to like? If it's just the two of us, do you want to go upstairs? Play chess? Come on. I think I should probably keep myself nice for the wedding night. Oh! Come on, Henry. Well, I suppose we could have a little practice go. Race you up the stairs. How's your essay going? This book is so boring! My task is basically to invent reasons why it's interesting, to make my teacher feel better about the fact that he liked it 40 years ago. - Man, that sucks. - Yeah. Another couple of years and you can do whatever you want with your life. - Join the army? - Except that. - Become a rally-car driver? - Or that. Demolitions expert? No way. So what you're saying is, I can do whatever you want me to do? No, you've still got plenty of options. There's, like, law, medicine, engineering, law, entertainment law, criminal law, my law. Why have I never met Christian before? What do you mean? Well, you two used to be best friends. Did you have a fight or something? Well, no. He just left town after his mum died, - and I didn't hear from him. - How'd his mum die? She killed herself. Whoa. That's intense. But not many people know that, so I wouldn't go spreading it around, ok? I can't even imagine you or mum dying. Well, we're not going to. Well, you will, eventually. Yeah, but not for a very long time. Why don't we invite Christian to my birthday tomorrow? - Really? - Yeah. Why not? - Ok, great. - Great! - Great. - Great! Alright. Fist bump. - Dad? - Yeah? Are we going to have to move? I don't know yet. Depends where I find a job. But we are not going anywhere until you finish this year's exams. I don't want you to leave. Let's not worry about it now. I'm going to work it out, ok? - You know why? - Why? - 'Cause I'm the best. - Well... - What? - Second-best. - To who? - I'm the best. - Then mum's third? - Yeah. The duck is the ruler. The duck's above us all. - I love you. - I love you. - You're not having one? - Me? No, no, no. I'm off it for awhile. Dry July? It turns out I just don't handle it very well. You're not doing that aa shit, are you? - Well, you know... - Hey, hey - fair enough. Hey! I tried to call you. Yeah, sorry. I had my phone in my bag. I didn't see it till I got home. Grace, was Richard at that party? - Christian... - Was he? I can't control whether or not he comes to a party, Christian. I'm really glad that you're coming. Yeah. Grace... Hold on. Ok. Can you see me? Uh-huh. Grace... I really think you should move back in when we get back to the states. - Christian... - It's been long enough. Let's talk about it when I get there. I have not had a drink in two months. That's good, but it's not just that. Hey, hey, hey, hey - I'm happier now. I like the guy I am now. What happens when everything goes back to normal and you fall back into old habits? It won't. I can guarantee you things will not go back to normal. I promise you that. We were hoping to source most of the ingredients locally, but we've lost most of the suppliers. Is this because of the mill? Of course it is. What are we going to do? Find someone in the city. Can we do that, is there enough time? Theoretically, but it's going to cost a lot more. Henry? It doesn't matter how much it costs. Organise it. - Oliver. - Mr nielson. I'm here to pick up Christian. We're going away for the night. You do remember we've got a rehearsal in the morning? A rehearsal? Yeah. Great having him back, isn't it? Yeah. I'm... I'm looking forward to the wedding. Oh, yeah. So... - What? - Where are they? If my brother finds out I stole these, he'll kill me. I don't want to sound like a pussy, but what if there's snakes and shit? You sound like a pussy, Adam. Shut up! Have you done this before? Not telling. You have. Who with? Just forget about it. Um, wait. Hey, slow down. - What's wrong? - Just... I... - It's ok. - You're hurting me. - I'm just... - Hang on. Just stop a second. - It's ok. - Just hang on a second. - I'm just... - Adam... Fucking hell! I'm just... - Stop for a second. - Oh, fuck it! Fuck it. Adam! Adam? Adam? Hedvig? Hedvig. I'm ok. I've been looking for you. I'm fine. What happened? I'm saying, I'm fine. You must be freezing. I'll make you a vegie burger. How's that sound? It'll be a three-course meal. It'll be soup, then the sort of steak or chicken choice. You're always thinking about the food! - Name plates. - I haven't seen the menu. Alright. Well, that's it for me. I'll say goodnight. Goodnight, dad. How many people - 150, 200 people? No-one from the town except you guys. He didn't write the invite list! We're only going 'cause of Walter. The whole town's falling apart, he's trying to party. Well, he's never much cared for other people's opinions. Must have been tough growing up with him as your old man. How'd he meet her? She was his housekeeper. You were his housekeeper! - Only for a little while. - Really? That's why she came up here. Yes, you are a lucky bastard. You wouldn't find a woman like that in this town, no way! I mean, apart from present company. Personally, I think she could do a bit better, mate. Do you want a hand? I'm almost done. I had no idea you worked for my father. Yeah. - Then you knew my mother? - Yeah, I did. Awful thing, what happened to her. Yeah, yeah. How long did you work there? Um, half a year. A year, maybe. Really? And why did you leave? Oliver and I got together, and I started getting some substitute work at the school. It's just... it's funny, my father never mentioned you. He didn't? No. I'd better get these things packed up. - I met Charlotte. - Hm? I didn't realise that's who it was. - What are you talking about? - I'd pictured her differently - from all mom's stories. - Christian... What are you guys talking about? - We'll talk about this later. - Does Oliver know? - What is going on? - Anna, could you just give us a moment, please? Excuse me? Just give us a moment, please. Fine. I'll have a cigarette anyway. It was a complicated time, Christian. I don't expect you to understand that. Your mother was seeing other people too. She wasn't seeing anyone! She was trying to see you. We were keeping up appearances. It hadn't been a relationship for years. Can you understand? - You never bothered to try. - I did try. I stuck with her. I knew she needed me. - It was a compromise for me. - She needed you... And you gave up on her. 'Cause I'd had enough. I was exhausted. I couldn't keep looking after her. Day in, day out, taking care of her. And I wanted... I wanted to be happy again. Oh, you wanted to be happy? What about mom? What about me, when am I going to get my turn? Anna, sorry for ruining your dinner. Christian, please. - Christian! - What? There's not a day I don't wish your mother was still alive. Good for you. What's going on? Nothing. Well, it didn't sound like nothing. I'll sleep in the other room so I don't wake you. - Henry! - I'm sorry! - Henry! - Anna, just leave me alone. What are you doing? Um... I just made a dummy for everyone who's left. Oh. Cool. Hi. Yeah, hi. Can you guess who this is? Um... I don't know. Is it Colin? No - Brett. You need to give him some red hair. Oh, my god! That's a great idea. - I'm sorry. - Hm? About... You know. It's ok. Yeah, that looks better. I've always wanted to do this. - You decapitated Brett! - Yeah. - What have you done? - It's a memorial. Yeah, for all the kids who left town. It's not bad. So, before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone, assignments 7a and b are due a week on Friday. Do you want to hang out after school? Yeah, ok. - I've got a surprise. - Ok. Hey, lovebirds! Where did you get this? It's my grandad's. Here. - Do you know how to use it? - Yeah. You want a go? - Yeah, alright. - Yeah? Yeah. Alright. You get it in your shoulder. Yeah, like that. And then cock the hammer. That's it. That's intense. Uh-huh! Hey, did you smell mr Peters' breath today? Yes. It was like something had died in there, like a homeless guy had set up his camp in his mouth. Exactly what it smelled like. What? Oh, just got a job interview. Already? Yeah, just some factory outside the city. - That's great! - Yeah. How about you take a raincheck on that marking? Why? Well, you know, I thought maybe we could... I'm busy. I know, I know, it's just that you're always busy. And... I figure it's, like, an hour before hedvig comes back. What was that for? - Just wanted to. - Get out of here! Hey, duck. What were you doing with that? - You scared me! - What were you doing? - Just shooting some cans. - Where? Down at the old factory. Next time, you ask me first. Do you understand? Yeah. I don't want you handling that gun without supervision. Sorry, grandad. - Promise? - Promise. Ok. Seen the duck? What's she doing? Do you think she'll ever be able to fly again? She's got plenty of determination, I'll give her that. Hello? Anyone home? Parents! Parents? What time is it? - Ten to nine. - Ah, shit. Yeah. Dad, I can see your bum. Sorry, sorry. Sorry, we fell asleep. Mm-hm! No, we were just having a nap. - Sure! Nap. - Just a nap! Gross! Busted. - So busted! - Yeah. She saw my bum. Where's grace? Christian? Tell me what's going on. Not now. Please. We're getting married in two days. Anna... We don't keep things from each other. Why didn't you tell me? I've never told anyone. Well, I don't want to be anyone. I'd never do that to you. Well, I won't stick around if you do. I know. Hey, mate. What's up? Hedgehog? Brekkie. Who's that? It's Christian. What's he doing here? He's coming to the city with me for the interview. - Why's he going? - He called last night. - He wanted to see me. - Why? I don't know. - He didn't say? - What's wrong? Nothing. Hedvig, you're going to be late. I haven't even eaten breakfast. Hurry up, then. - Can you answer it, baby? - Sure. Don't do it for her. - Hi. - Hi. I thought I'd lend him a suit. Oh. That's nice of you. Mr Finch. Who are you? It's Christian... Dad! He came camping with us. Henry's son. Oh. I taught you how to play football. You were crap. Hey, Christian. I overslept. We're running late. Bye! Bye! Look after Oliver, won't you? He hasn't been in the city for years. I'll do my best. - You ready? - I am. Hey! Toast kiss! You're beautiful. - I made you lunch. - Yeah. Hello? I need to talk to you. What are you doing in town today? Just getting some more chicken wire. Bloody rabbits - they're tunnelling under the walls again. Where are you going? Is Adam coming to school today? The bus is waiting. Better go and have a word to hedvig, eh? Dad got a job up north. What? I'm sorry. When are you going to come back? I don't know. They found me a place at a school up there. Hedvig? Why didn't you tell me? I'm sorry. They all look so young. We used to look like that? I hardly remember being here, hey. Do you remember how hammered we used to get? At least you got laid, you know? You experienced it, you had fun. I wasted my time chasing Erica flowers for two years. What happened to her? She turned out to be a lesbian. - You're kidding me? - No. I spent three years convinced she was playing hard-to-get. We should hurry up. Interview's in 20 minutes. Yeah. I'm just going to hang out here. Really? Maybe check out a few of the old haunts. - I'll come find you. - Do that. Wish me luck. Good luck. Thanks for coming. That's ok. Christian knows, doesn't he? He may not say anything. I can't lose them, Henry. I'll try and talk to Christian. He's in the city with Oliver. I'll call him. Excuse me? Just one more. Well, I'm sure as shit not getting that job. There were, like, ten 20-year-olds sitting in the waiting room, psyching me out. What happened? I don't have to be on my best behaviour anymore. Grace isn't coming. She what? She's done this before. What? Just disappeared without notice. Fuck. That's not good, hey? Yeah. She's been staying at a friend's house. We've been on a break. Hey, do you want one of these? - Ah... - Come on. Alright, fuck it. Let's do it. Oh, we're going to do it. Like old times, we're going to do it. Carl, I need you to duplicate this. I'm going to take one of those. - Here. Right there. - Cheers. I'm sorry about that interview. 20-year-olds! The problem is, I get in there and I'm stressed out. Cheers. - Alright. - Garon! I think I may have turned Erica flowers because of my natural repulsion. See that? The wing's coming on strong. I reckon she might just make it back up into the air. You alright, love? Why did you go to jail? I did a bad thing. What did you do? I found a way to hide a whole heap of money that we were supposed to pay. You and mr nielson? Yeah. Why didn't he go to jail? Well, Henry's name wasn't on the documents, and there was no point of both of us going down. Why'd you do it? I don't know. Greed, loyalty to a friend. And I wanted to make a good life for your father. I was sitting here. They'd just convicted my dad. It was all over the news, and he was on the TV just up there. And there was this group of guys. I was drinking back there, and one of them just kept shouting out, 'isn't that your dad?' But I ignored him. I kept drinking. But the fucking prick, man, the fucking prick just kept shouting till the whole pub was listening, and I turned to him. I wanted to punch his fucking face in. I looked up at the TV. I looked at my dad straight in the face... And I said, 'I've got no idea who that guy is.' and then I dropped out of uni. I never would have met Charlotte if I hadn't moved back home. Look at hedvig. She's a genius. I know - 'shut up.' I'm meant to say that 'cause I'm her dad, but she's a genius, and all the stuff... She's a very bright girl. All the stuff I never got to do, she's going to do it - she's going to do it. Oliver, there's something that I really need to... What are you guys doing in here? We were just reminiscing. This is, um, this is Oliver. Hi, Oliver. Hi. This is my friend Christian. We used to go to uni here. What do you do now? Christian is kind of a hot-shot businessman. I don't like to brag. What about you, what do you do? I am just a local fella, just from around here, - local guy. - You don't sound like one. Oh, really? Good. I try pretty hard to stave that off. No, no, no. - On both 1... - 2... - 2... - 3... Horse. - Dolphin! - Nah, nah, nah! - Dolphin. - Dolphins? We're not playing dolphins. That was impressive. - It's impressive! - I'm impressive. I'm out of my league. Where are you guys staying tonight? That's a good question. We were actually meant to be home a few hours ago. When? About, like, five hours or so. You should stay the night with us. We're actually married men. Does it matter? To me, it does. It does! To me, it does. What about you? Are you alright? I'm sorry! I'm out of practice. I'm about to fall over myself. What time is it? Um... It's quarter to two. We got to get back. Listen, I'm going to drink some water... - We need a plan. - I'll drink some water, and we'll give it, like, an hour. We'll give it two hours. We need a plan. Come here, mate. I've missed you, mate. - Oliver? - Yeah? I don't want to ever grow up. - It's too late, mate. - Let's never grow up. It's too late. Where the fuck have you been? Oh, my god, you look great, Anna. We have to start. Just give him a few minutes. What happened? I couldn't get on the plane. Grace, you could have called me. I just wasn't ready. Christian, there's something I need to talk to you about. I'm running late for my dad's wedding, so... Oh. What is it? I can call you later. No, you can't call me later. You can tell me now. What's going on, what is it? We should talk later. Grace, let's talk about it now. - What's going on? - No, let's not do this now. What? You and I were never right for each other, Christian. I could never figure you out, and you never let me in. - I just... - Don't do this. Not now. I've been seeing Richard again. Don't do this, don't do this. I'm sorry. What are you telling me, that you've been fucking Richard while I was waiting for you to arrive, calling you every hour? You've been fucking Richard? Is that what you're telling me right now? It wasn't... I did everything for you. I'm sorry. Stop saying that. - I'm sorry. - Stop saying that! Don't say that. I'm sure you think you should be sorry. You're a fucking liar. Come on, we're going to start. What are you doing? Congratulations. Let's do this. To have and to hold... To have and to hold. - ..For better or for worse... - For better or for worse. For richer or for poorer... For richer or for poorer. In sickness and in health... In sickness and in health. Till death do us part. Till death do us part. Christian, please come forward with the rings. Christian? The rings. Dance hall days Christian! Come on, dance. Dance with me, come on. Right, let's go. Hey, hey! Come on, baby! Salsa that was lovely, wasn't it? You think? Yeah, it was beautiful. You didn't feel even a tinge of jealousy? What are you doing? Have you told Oliver? You haven't, have you? How could you do that to the man you love? He was an absolute mess. His father was in jail. I wanted to tell him. I really wanted to tell him, but I had to wait for a better time. But you never did, did you? You don't think it's cruel to let him keep living that lie? You've seen our family. Do you think there's something wrong with the way that we live? Please just leave us alone. We're happy. Just let us be. You should tell him tonight. He deserves to know. You do not need to be scared of the truth. You don't need to be scared of this, Charlotte! Let's go. Hedvig needs to be in bed. Can't we stay a little longer? It's way past your bedtime. Since when do I have a bedtime? - Bedtime? She's not 12. - I'm not 12! You need to be in school tomorrow. You coming? I'm going to stay a bit longer. - How will you get home? - I'll walk. Why don't you just come now? Christian's leaving in a couple of days. - Can't you see him tomorrow? - What's wrong with you? Ok. I'm going to stay with you. - You don't have to. - I want to stay. You do want to stay? Alright. You're going home, hedvig. - Can we stay longer? - Mum and dad can. Walter, can you take hedvig home? Yeah, no worries. Is this where you've been all night, dad? Give me the bottle. - I can't do that, sir. - Give me that fucking bottle. Sorry, sir. Hey, good man. Go fuck yourself. Hey, how was your night? I can't find Christian. Probably gone to bed. Let's go home. I'll just look inside the house. Come on, Oliver! I'll be one second. Promise. One second. Christian! Christian? You ok? Do you know what this room is? How much have you had to drink? Guess. I don't know, mate. Go on, guess. Mate, we should get you some water. This... This is where she did it. She called me five times that night. I thought it was just another one of her... you know. And her last call was 15 minutes before I got home, and I didn't call her back. And I haven't been in here since. Oliver? Yeah? Grace... Grace left me. Fuck. You alright? No, not really. What? - Uh... - What is it? Charlotte hasn't told you, has she? Told me what? I didn't want to be the one to do this. Get him off, get him off! You fucking prick! Get him out! Can you help me? Henry! Oliver! Stay away from me. Oliver, please. Please! Get your fucking hands off me! Why didn't you tell me? I'm sorry. You remember what it was like. We'd only just started seeing each other. You were drunk half the time, and there was barely a relationship. That gives you an excuse to fuck someone else? - No! I just... - Were you in love with him? Were you in love with him? Yes. I thought you were in love with me. Not yet. Well, not really. Not really? I'm sorry. Oh, fucking hell! - I'm in love with you now. - Get off me! Get your fucking hands off me. - How many people know? - No-one. How many people know? Don't fucking lie to me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You let me live in this town, with that man. You let me work for him. I took his fucking money! - How could you do that to me? - I'm sorry. How could you fucking do that to someone you love? - I'm so sorry. - Oh, I'm an idiot. Don't say that. - Don't say that. - I'm a fucking idiot. If you were in love with him, why'd you stay with me? Oliver, I... 'Cause when his wife killed herself, he wouldn't see you anymore, and I was the second-best option, right? Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Oliver, stop it. Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus! Oliver? Please tell me it wasn't 'cause you were pregnant. Charlotte, tell me it wasn't 'cause you were pregnant. - Oliver, please stop. - Answer the question. I'm begging you. Answer the fucking question! Yes, I was pregnant. With hedvig? Yes. - So... - Oliver... - Please. - Let go of me! Oliver! Oliver! Charlotte, I didn't know about hedvig. You're disgusting. I'm sorry. Don't you dare tell hedvig. Hey. Hey, um... Are you ok? Where are you? Hey, Ollie? Why don't you just come home, son? I'll be there soon. Um, he's staying at the motel, and he wants me to bring him some clothes. I'll go. No, I don't think it's a good idea, love. Look, don't worry. I'll have a good talk with him. He'll be home. What's going on? Why is dad staying at the motel? Hedvig, why don't you have a shower, and we'll take the bus together? Mum, what's happening? - Everything's fine. - Hurry, you'll be late. Your mother left me once for someone else. She told me she was in love with this painter fellow. He taught her life drawing or something. She said she was sorry and that she'd never really loved me. You hungry? No. You want to talk about it? No. So I threw myself into my work. I started the business with Henry. And then one day, your mother came back. He'd gotten bored with her, he'd moved on to someone else. So I said that I'd forget all about it, and we should start again. And so we did. You were born a couple of years later. I only had a few years left with your mother before she died but... They were a few very good years. I can't forgive her. Why not? I can't trust her again. Of course you can. That was a long time ago. You were different people then. Everyone's got a story like this, Oliver. It's as old as the hills. Hey, Greg's called in sick. I need you to take his 11 o'clock. - History? - Yeah, just for today. That's hedvig's class. What's wrong with that? On the one hand, we have the industrial revolution, and on the other, we have the romantic movement in art. - Er, in this painting... - What did you do? Turner wasn't the only painter to represent a post-enlightenment... Tell me what you did. In this painting by Joseph Wright... Did you cheat on him? Is that what you did? Hedvig, can we have this conversation outside, please? - You did, didn't you? - Hedvig, stop it. - Stop it now. - You cheated on him. Shut up! Stop laughing. - Hedvig... - Stop laughing! - It's not funny. - Hedvig, stop it. I hate you! - Outside, now! - Fuck! Shut the fuck up! Hedvig, come back here! Hedvig! What do you want? Walter, please. I'm sorry about everything that's happened. I want to set up a trust for hedvig. You what? It's only fair. It's out in the open. She deserves, you all deserve, a fair share. I want to make sure you're all comfortable. Fuck off, Henry. Walt... I understand that you're angry at me, but hedvig shouldn't have to suffer because of that. She won't. We'll make sure of that. You've done enough damage to this family, so why don't you fuck off out of this town and leave us to pick up the pieces? You know what the miracle is, Henry? Hedvig doesn't bear one trace of you. Not one, thank god. She's Oliver's daughter. Stay out of our lives! Hi. Hey. Aren't you supposed to be at school? Yeah. Then you're waiting for your dad? Yeah. He's not in there. Maybe he's gone back home. No, his stuff's still in there. I looked. Does your duck have a name? It's a duck, Christian. Why would it have a name? What, so you're just going to keep saying 'it'? Yeah, or 'you' when I'm talking to it. I think you should come up with a name for her. Like what? Lucky. Why? Because my father shot her, and she survived. Lucky. Lucky ducky. You're a dag. Yeah, I really am. You want to kiss me? What? It's ok. I've had sex before. I know what to do. And I'm not going to tell anybody. No! What are you doing? No! Jesus Christ, hedvig! - I'm sorry. - No, no... I'm in idiot. I'm sorry! - No, you're not. - I'm such an idiot! - Stupid idiot! I'm sorry. - Hedvig. Hedvig? You don't understand. Tell me what's going on. Please? Tell me. Please. Dad? No, dad! Dad, please! Dad! I can't talk to you right now. Please come home. Christian told me. It's ok. No, it's not. Can't you just pretend that you never found out? No. I'm your daughter! - No, you're not. - You brought me up! No, you're his daughter. And I think you should be glad. He's very successful. He's rich. He'll make sure you have a good life. I don't want to be anyone else's daughter. You don't have a choice. I just want our family back together! It's ok. It's ok. Your mum will look after you. No. Not mum, you. Dad, why can't you just pretend? No! - No, dad. I really need you. - I have to go. - I really need you. - I have to go, hedvig. - Let go of me, ok? - I'm begging you. I can't look at you! Dad? Do you understand that I can't fucking look at you? Leave me alone! Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! Ssh! Goodbye, lucky. You've got to go now. I can't look after you anymore. I know you can fly. Please! Will you please fly? Come on - go, go! You can do it. Come on, please! Please fly. Learn to fly for me. Fly! ..Out at the coral sea, where it's expected to completely dissipate by around lunchtime tomorrow. Several coastal suburbs are feeling the aftermath today, with power lines still down in several areas, and 500 homes have been damaged. It's too soon to tell what the cost of the damage could amount to. I'm looking for hedvig Finch. - Are you a relative? - Yeah, I'm her father. Go to the desk on level 1. - Mr and mrs Finch? - Yeah. Hi, I'm dr chandran. Why don't you have a seat? How is she? She's still in a critical condition. We're doing the best we can, but it's hard to say now. Is she going to be ok? I don't know. I'm sorry. We just have to wait... She can't die. - Oliver? - She can't fucking die! Oliver. I told her I didn't want to look at her! It doesn't matter. What have I done? What did I do? Shh. - I pushed her away. - Stop it. It'll be ok. I'm sorry! You have to be strong for her. She needs us to be strong right now. Ssh. It'll be ok, it'll be ok. Everything will be ok.
