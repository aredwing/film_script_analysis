Give me your hand. ANTHONY: Oh, fuck! JULIAN: Reach. ANTHONY: Pull, pull! You need more than that. JULIAN: It was your idea, you know. ANTHONY: Dude, don't let me fucking... Grab it. I got it. Fuck. Dude, this is the same one that we found in that girl's hand. Pull me out, man. Hey, is that a gator? (GRUNTING) Pull me, man! Pull me! (GRUNTING) Oh, Shit! Shit! Pull! Go, go, go, man! Come on! JULIAN: Come on. Come on! Come on, run! Come on. Come on. You know how to drive one of these? My cousin had one. Come on, come on. Lay low! Push, man, push! Come on! (GUNSHOTS) Where should we go? I don't know! Just keep going! Hey, skeletal augmentation with titanium alloy. These are not ordinary assassins, man. Who's that? Can you see? Holy shit! JULIAN: She's shooting. Go this way! Go down that canal. ANTHONY: Fuck, I don't Know where this leads, man. (TATIANA SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Push it faster! Anthony' faster! (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) You missed us, bitch! We're out of here! (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) ANTHONY: Wait a minute. She's gaining on us. She's got the scope. Come on! You gotta go side to side. Side to side! We gotta shake them! JULIAN: We're not losing her! I think there's something up here. Make a left. Hold on, man! Hold on! (SCREECHES) ANTHONY: Hold on! Hold on! JULIAN: Can't this thing go faster? ANTHONY: Big bump! Hold on! (GRUNTS) Motherfucker! Yeah! Whoo! Fuck! (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) ANTHONY: Bio-enhanced assassins. That's some real black ops shit. Who are they? What did they want at Fort Polk? I've been thinking, maybe it's some kind of ultra high-tech weapons system. JULIAN: And I've been thinking about that tattoo. I know I've seen it somewhere, like, on a woman. I'm gonna need your help remembering that. Yeah. Last year, my physics adviser had a meeting with some researchers at Fort Pork' and he came back and he... JULIAN: Simone. You mind if we talk about this later? Okay, sure. I'm gonna be in my room. All right. You ready to get to work? Yeah. Cue the music, let's do it. (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (JULIAN MOANING) Baby, get it right there. Oh. Hey. What is going on here? Ah, how do I say this? Julian's got what he calls a pornographic memory. You mean photographic memory? ANTHONY; No. Total sexual recall. He says he can literally never forget a fuck. I need quiet. ANTHONY: Right now he's going through his memory banks. For fun? For the job. (SCOFFS) Okay, okay. You're saying he's going into this memory of his and recalling all the girls he's ever slept with? How long could that possibly take? Oh. Ooh. (PANTING) You got 15 minutes. (JULIAN MOANING) Oh, do that right there. Ooh, girl! Oh, yeah, I remember that night. She had so many tattoos. She had, like, Egyptian hieroglyphics. "Savage North or "South," or something like that. No. That's not it. Jessica, I remember her. Yeah. She kind of had a little mustache, but... No, that wasn't a tattoo. Ah, twerking Tina. TINA: Yeah. JULIAN: Yes. Twerking Tina. Where's that tattoo? No, she had a buttery. Oh! My Asian persuasion. The tramp stamp. And the sleeve. Oh, but she would slap so hard. No, damn it! Ooh. Flapjacks. Yes, I know she had a tattoo. Oh, it was a rose. I'm looking for that damn scorpion. Oh, yes! The two wild shippers. They had a lot of tattoos. What were their tattoos'? Oh, that's right. What did she have, like a magic dragon or something? No, it wasn't a scorpion. Oh, but she was working her body. Then we went to Pinkberry after that. Ooh, Simone. (MOANS) JULIAN' Girl, you slimmed up. What was you doing, Herbalife? Oh, yeah. She had a fire dragon. It was like a phoenix. (GASPS) No! You are so bad. JULIAN: She didn't have a tattoo, why is she in this sequence? Get me out of here! (GASPS) Oh! How long was I under? ANTHONY: Three hours. Any luck? No, wrong context Simone, you said you, uh, know a professor who did some work at Fort Polk? Oh, yeah. My physics advisor. He wanted to get physical. I didn't do it. I could've got an A. They offered me a lot of money for a few equations, and I turned them down. So, uh, what they were making was pretty expensive, huh? It was revolutionary. (CHUCKLES) But by now I'm sure it's being developed by every industrialized country and every big corporation with a robotics division. I heard the Chinese are particularly interested. Enough to hire assassins to infiltrate a US base? That's about as much as I'm comfortable saying. Anyway, remind Simone she owes me, uh, extra credit. Okay. Thanks for your time. Appreciate n. Mmm-hmm. All right. Get that extra credit, huh? (HANNAH PLAYING PIANO) (LAPTOP BEEPING) Ms. Wollcrofl. Professor Gussain. How can I help you? Thefts of ballistic software in Mumbai seven months ago, Stockholm two months ago, now a failed attempt at Fort Polk' HANNAH: Is there a question here? I want to know what you people are up to. Ask yourself if that's something you'd really like to Know. Because I can oblige you. Others are beginning 10 find out. Do yourself a favor, Professor, leave others to the professionals. Good day. BOJAN: It is gone. Worried about your safety? That is good. You should be. The Wolf needs you. To do what? Extrapolate from incomplete blueprints. Fill in what we are missing. As of this morning, Fort Polk will no longer house the military's exo-project. Security there is about as tight as my wife's rear end. I had a feeling you'd ask me that Turns out that girl's body up and walked off after all. Right after I told you where she was. Now you, son, are not your daddy. Frankly, I don't know what you are. I do Know your ambitions go beyond his, and it's got you mixed up with folks he wouldn't approve of. (CHUCKLES) As chair of the Senate committee on national security, I know a hell of a lot. Take my advice, don't leave the country. Wouldn't want to have to serve an indictment to some spider hole somewhere. Go on, we're done here. Go on with you now. Go on. (ENGINE STARTS) Motherfucker. (DOOR CLOSES) (DOG BARKING) (ON PHONE) Yes, this is Dragovic. Keep working. BOJAN: What did you say? What did you say'!? What did you say'!? (BARKING) (GROWLING) (GRUNTING) (CELL PHONE CHIMING) (EXHALES) Yeah. BOJAN: New orders from the Wolf. You are going to pay a visit to Senator Barnes. And thus time, Tatiana, do not fuck it up. ANTHONY: Who has jurisdiction over Fort Polk? Non-military, I mean. Senator James Barnes. ANTHONY: All right, we're gonna hit Barnes' office in Baton Rouge in the morning' Wait, Barnes is in town this weekend. Today's the annual gala for Tulane alumni. Gussain is supposed to go. Hmm. JULIAN: Whoa! She got those Helen Binghams. Wow. You really don't stop, do you? What? Hang on, no. I know where I saw that tattoo. Oh, shit. Bingham. Pay attention. I have a little business to attend to. Catalina, take this. Look after Mummy, will you? ANTHONY: Of course. The Order of the Ghost Scorpion. Order of the what now? It was this post-Cold War experiment, an attempt to fill the power vacuum after the Wall came down' An international consortium of assassins. (G ROANS) (BOTH GRUNTING) Here. HELEN: Do you need a moment? (GUNSHOT) BOJAN: What did you say your name was? Bingham. Helen Bingham. ANTHONY'. Bojan Dragovic was a godfather and guru. An expert in irregular warfare and bio-enhancement technologies. The titanium bones. That's right. He created a cadre of super-assassins. After the oligarchs bought out Russian intelligence, Dragovic brought the organization into the private sector, working with whoever was willing to pay. Most recently, a financier known as the Wolf. How do you know all this? I just know where to look, Tor, Deep Web' Wikipedia. (TYPING) (CELL PHONE BUZZING) What? What is it? Uh, it's Professor Gussain. Mmm. It's for you. The Wolf plans to kill Barnes today. I got to get this number to Barnes' security, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Gussain contacted us. So what? That means he's too scared to contact anyone else. Even the Senator's security. The Wolf's got people everywhere. If we're going to do something, we've got to do it on our own. Where's this gala at? Still so much like the intern I took on 20 years ago. You couldn't take no for an answer then either. I suppose that's part of your appeal to your investors. I'm glad you made it tonight' James. After our last meeting. Oh, oh, oh. Even old friends don't always see eye-to-eye. I hope you don't need my affirmation anymore, Hannah. No' but I'll always need your vote, Senator. (CELL PHONE BUZZING) Ah. If you'll excuse me. Of course. This is Hannah Wollcrcft. Yes, I'll take the call. (SPEAKING MANDARIN) Hey, what time are we starting at? Already started, man. Oh, shit. Play it cool. Play it cool. Play it cool. I need to see some IDs. (CLEARS THROAT) You know, she got my ID. Oh! You got the. I keep 'em in here. (CHUCKLES) Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I left them at home. What?

ANTHONY: Great, thank you. Take care, guys. Let me see your ID, man. You really work here? SIMONE: Bye! JULIAN: And these spots normally have rooms we can cut through, so... ANTHONY: Yeah, we'll go. We'll find another way through. JULIAN; All right. BEST MAN: Whoever would've guessed me tossing Terrible Timmy out of the ring would literally land him in the lap of love? (APPLAUSE) Look at this couple, aren't they great? Hey, man, high five. Look at this hot couple. I mean, come on. (APPLAUSE) Enough of me and the word games. Let's hear some of Tina and Tim's friends' words of encouragement and love. You, sir, you. Red tie, come here for a second. Me? BEST MAN: You. Come here. You sure you want me? BEST MAN: Just say something about this great couple. No, you. (CHUCKLES) (ALL CHEERING) Well, uh...

A mini-bar in Little Tokyo, and we got into some small talk' had some short ribs. And what can I say about the bride, right? She's so effervescent. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Tina? (MOANING) Tina? Yeah. Twerking Tina? It is a small world. (STUTTERING) You know what I mean. (CHUCKLES) Tina and I, uh, met at a strip club... Mall. Strip mall, met at a strip mall. And, um... I always said, with that kind of ass. Assets. She has many assets that work in her favor. And I always thought that she was destined for big things. Obviously, we all know that big things come in small packages. Or smaller packages, right? Anyways, do you still have that tattoo? She has a great tattoo of a cowgirl holding a lasso. So every time she'd twerk, the lasso would just. It would whip like that. It would just do a little whip like that It was a pelvic thrust that she would do. Anyways, we all have a style. I have a style. You all have a style. Breaking Bad, you have a style. And if tiny Tim can handle that, then more power to you, and if he can't... Then, girl' you need to call me. All right, okay. (MIC FEEDBACK) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (GRUNTING) JULIAN: Ah! This isn't a fair fight! How many of y'all want some? ANTHONY: Come on. Dump this shit. MAN: Switch! (SCREAMING) JULIAN: Okay, okay!

The Order has lowered its standards, huh? No more world powers for clients. No more finger on the pulse of history. Now you're just another corporate tool. A cog in the wheel. Shut up, Mr Hester. Whoa. SIMONE: Jay? Jay? Hello'? Jay? Wake up, baby. Come on. Wake up! (CELL PHONE BUZZING) Do you like Chekhov'? You don't mean chief navigator of the Enterprise, so Cherry Orchard, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters... (SPEAKING MANDARIN) (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) A little college Russian. Tatiana, kill him.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Dragno? (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) (SCOFFS) And here I thought all this daddy-issue, killer-cow bullshit was just a sales ploy. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Only because I can see you're hurting. Tonight, our chief Chinese competitor, having developed their own exo-project in parallel with the US military, agreed to a merger. We no longer need the US government or their exo-armor. We have our own. It's so much more civilized that way, don't you think? Our Chinese counterpart made the merger conditional in dissolving all of our previous entanglements. Which unfortunately means all of you. Dispose of them. ANTHONY: If a black market weapons dealer fucked the madam of a cripples-only orphanage while Gordon Gekko came on their faces, the thing they'd make would be you' The Wolf. You flatter me. This time make sure the bodies are never found. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) Your handler got what he deserves. So will you. My handler? He was the only father I've ever known. I lost my family. No one fucking cares. And no more talking. We're almost to the drop zone. There's no reason to go on. Yeah? There's always stripping, if you need a reason to live. Jules' you okay, man? Yeah. Non-lethal dose of Propofol. But he's going to wish he didn't wake up. You need a reason to go on, now about vengeance? We'll help you. Hey, man. So the bodies don't float. (BOTH GRUNTING) PILOT: Hey, what's going on back there' guys? Hey, man, I don't approve of all of that. (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) What was it, the stripping or the vengeance? All right, I need a little help. Need a little help, guys! Tony, get him out! You know what you're doing? TATIANA: I learned in the army. Tank's been shot. We're losing fuel fast. We'll have just enough to reach our destination. What's that? Vengeance. We're going to the Wolf's den. JULIAN: The Wolf's Den? Is that a strip club? (EXHALES) (SPEAKING MANDARIN) We have severed all ties. So it's a dean start. (MR.

(GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTING) (GROANS) (GRUNTS) You have a lifetime of training on me, I'll give you that. But I have the best combat software money can buy.
