Yeah, then he was stabbed at the park. And you brought him here? You have to take him to the hospital. - I can't treat him here. - I can't. There was a cop there. And he was the one trying to hide his body. If I take him to the hospital, he's gonna find him. I don't wanna have anything to do with the police. Please, Mom, just do what you can and I'll get him out of here soon. - I promise. - Oh, God. okay, just get me the first-aid kit. Alright. No, don't... don't touch me. I'm sick. Don't touch my blood. Here, Mom. Let me die. Or I'll kill you both. Mom. Why the hell would you bring him here? I'm sorry. You should have left him where you found him. What where you thinking? You idiot! You're right. I'll take him to the hospital. Don't! Not yet. Wait until it's dark. Otherwise someone's gonna see you. Son of a bitch. Where the fuck am I? It's okay, you're safe. I don't need your fucking help. I... brought you something. Here. Drink. Come on. Drink. [Elm Leave me alone... You deaf motherfucker. Caleb. That tagger who saw you last night, do you know him? Why? Do you know him or not? Fuck.

You keep this shit out of my house. What's the big deal? It's not like Mom can say anything anymore. Wait here until I come back. Goddamn idiot. Hi, Peter. Hi, Mom. You're very lucky. Nobody heard anything at the hospital. I think we're okay. Eva? Where are you? Eva? What? What am I gonna do with you? Next time you're out. I won't allow you to fuck it all up again! I just can't. I thought you were done with this shit! - It was just this once- - Save it! You heard me. Next time you're out! - Morning, Harris! - Uh, hey, lieutenant! How's everything in our humble little town? Peaceful. Been a little fender bender over on Fourth and Burwash but nobody got hurt, thank God. Nothin' else? No. Nothing last night? No. At least not according to Russell's report. Why, did you heard something? No, just checkin'. Thank you. Oh, the chief called from Black River. He said he's gonna stay out there a couple more days. Thank God his wife's surgery went so well, huh? Oh, good, excellent. Give him my best if he calls again. Yeah. Peter! It's dark, take him out now. Make sure nobody sees you. okay- Um, hello? Sir? Eva. Peter! What happened? There's someone outside! Come on out, you little faggot! - What do you want? - We want you. Fucking rat! Get your ass out here, or else we're coming' in for you!

Stop! - Don't, Peter. - Don't go out there, please. - Mom. Please trust me. - I can take care of it. - What do you want? - Come here. Oh. Oh, no. I swear, I'm not gonna tell anyone. I said get over here. Oh, no. Oh, no. Peter. No. Fucking rat! No. Stop it! Stop it! - Like to talk, huh? - Asshole! Stop it! Stop, Please. Stop it! Stay inside. I'm not saying it again!

He wasn't dead. Bullshit! I swear I'm telling the truth, sir. That's why I helped him out. So where is he now? I don't know, sir. I swear. He left last night. By himself? Lieutenant. I'm busy here. I know. I'm sorry, sir. We found your son's friend. okay- He was still alive when they brought him here. And they severed his jugular and he bled out. Coroner put his time of death about 8 to 10 hours ago. Did you close Route 15? Yeah. The team says they're getting upset. They wanna talk to the chief. The chief is in Black River, I'm in charge now. But, lieutenant, even if we set up road blocks we still have no idea who we're looking for. Yeah, we do. Caucasian male, 6 feet tall, 30-35, brown hair with a beard. Start looking for him. Yes, sir. I need your assistance. De Luca. okay. Yeah, okay, I'm on my way! He had a heart attack. Probably caused by thrombosis due to the burns. He's stable for now but, uh... His blood levels dropped dangerously low. He could have another thrombosis... or an embolism. And this time, it could be fatal. My son is gonna live longer than you and me. - Understood? - Yeah. We have a conversation to finish. Get in. I can't. What about my bike and my things? Nobody's gonna steal your shit. Get in the car. Get in the car. Come on! I swear I've told you everything I know! I'm not protecting him! Please, sir! What do you want? I wanna talk. Here? Get out of the car. okay, cuff yourself to that. What for? Do it. I swear I won't run away, sir. I'll tell you whatever you want! Come on. I told you not to lie to me. I didn't lie! I swear I was telling the truth! You told me you didn't know who he was. I don't! He came by my house. But I've never seen him before! okay- I'll give you one more shot. Do you wanna know how my son feels? Please, sir! - Where is he? - I don't know! I swear! You motherfucker! No! No! No! You thought you were gonna get away, motherfucker? What happened? Oh, my God! What are you doing? I have to take him to the hospital! And look at him! Let me go.. In 5 minutes he will be dead, and I won't be able to help him. So keep quiet and don't move. What are you doing? You.. Oh, my God. I need an ambulance. My son has been in an accident! 20905 Anderson Drive. He's dying, please send someone right away! What are you doing? Are you insane? Leave my son alone! I'm begging you! Please, hurry up! Please! Please, please. Sweetie, hold on. The ambulance is on its... The ambulance is on its way. My love, sweetie, please. What happened to Ana? Is he your son? Get out of my house! Get out! Hold on. I'm really sorry, Monica, but I still don't understand. How could this happen to him? He probably wasn't looking. And when he lit the match, the can exploded. Monica, Peter has burns of different degrees on different parts of his body. Are you absolutely certain this was an accident? He's always been so reckless. Alright. I'll come back later to see how he's doing. - Thank you. - okay. Is Peter Ana's son? What are you doing here again? She was my wife. I need to know what happened. If she was your wife, then you should know. She was running away from you. What happened? Good morning, Ana. Would you like me to take him? Yes, please. Goodbye, my love. Don't worry, she'll take care of you. Should I close the curtains? No, I'd like to watch the sunrise. okay- Nobody knew what happened to her. Ana wasn't normal, she... she was sick. I know, but Peter... was born healthy. He's not a danger to anyone. How do you know that? Because he's my son! The only danger here is you. Goddamn kid. I don't know how you made it out alive or where the fuck you came from, but your life is gonna end in this fucking cell. What you did to Caleb is nothing compared to what I'm gonna do to your sorry ass. You hear me, you piece of shit? Send my regards to your son. Motherfucker! I'll kill you right now. Then what are you waiting for? Everything okay? Yeah. Everything's fine. Friendly little chat, that's all. Quit breathing down my neck, Harris. Mom. Mom. Mom? Sweetie, how are you feeling? Better. Morning, Monica. - Hi, Sonia. - Hi. Looks like we're feeling better today, Peter. We're gonna change the bandages on your arms, okay? Can you lift your arm up a little for me? That's good. Something's not right here. It's been less than 12 hours. No. No. Don't touch it, it can get infected. It's okay, Mom. It doesn't hurt anymore. Doesn't hurt at all. Wait, let me help you. Oh my God. Are you ready? No, not really. Just bring whatever you need right now. We can pick up the rest later. We can't come back, Mom. We'll have to see about that. Hurry up; we can still make the 11 o'clock bus, okay? okay- May I help you, sir? Yes, what happened to the boy who was in this bed? - Did he die? - No, he was discharged. - You sure? - Yes. He left this morning. It was a miracle. Come on. What's happening? Sorry. Thank you! - Fuck! - Fuck. Don't stop! Please! He's trying to kill us. Please don't stop the bus. [Elm Hey. I'm looking for two passengers. How did you heal so fast? What did they do to you? I just wanna help my son. Please. Just tell me. Please, or he's going to die. Please tell me. What the fuck did you do? - No! Leave him alone. - You stay here! m! - Stop! - Tell me! - Stop! - Tell me what you did, or I'll kill him right here. - No. Don't tell him anything. - You shut the fuck up. He'll kill us anyway. If you talk... I'll let you go. No, Mom. No. Swear you'll let us go. You have my word. We should take the sample at the hospital. No, we can't let him out. We gotta do it here. Lieutenant, you can't take a blood sample without a court order. You know that. I told you to get off my back, Harris. I'm sorry, sir, but I may have to call the chief on this one. You go over my head on this and you have no idea what's in the store for you. Understood? Alright, boys, go ahead. I got this. Come on. Ah! No! No! No! No! Go ahead. Please, don't do...
