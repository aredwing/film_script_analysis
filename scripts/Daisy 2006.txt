I started planting the flowers she painted, hoping that they would help remove the smell of gunpowder on me. But the smell deep inside my soul doesn't disappear. The Magnum 357 revolver doesn't leave shells. Hollow-point bullets also leave no shells. For an assassin... leaving traces means death. OFF LIMITS Welcome. I'm so sorry that this is still necessary. Following the rules keeps you alive. Look at you like a lump of rock heavy, hard, and unchanging. Do you know me that well? Of course I do. I heard you are up for something new lately. I grow flowers. Grow Flowers? I thought there is a girl. For a killer, women are more dangerous than guns. You have to be careful. Don't worry. Look at this antique gun. If you don't handle it right ...it'll kill you before killing your enemy A woman is just as dangerous You got to be careful Flowers! Bye. Who could it be? The one who sends me flowers everyday at 4:15 I looked up the meaning of daisy Hidden love! OK. One more time My grandfather thinks I am like an antique... ...because I'm 24 and have never had a date. Good pose But I have someone I'm waiting for. You should smile more naturally. Here we go. Are you sure it's a good picture? Of course, now look this way. Well, here it is. Ok, here's your key. Thank you. Good, all the best. I remember the first day I saw her. April 15th. It was the day after I killed a man for the first time. - After that... - Flowers! I began delivering daisies to her every day. Because of her, I learned about van Gogh, Monet, and Rembrandt. Okay, Five o'clock coffee time! - You want some coffee? - Yes, please! Good? If I pretend I'm her... I feel like my soul is pure, at least a little bit. Why does he send flowers but never show himself? How much? Okay Can you pay first? Sorry, but I have to go. Okay? Oh, but I'm not done yet... Ah! You're Korean? Yes. Will you be here tomorrow? I'll come tomorrow at the same time. You can continue then, okay? Okay. You want some candy? Okay. I am so sorry. I spilled coffee on your portrait. I should start again. Oh... Okay. Go ahead. Hello? What? You should look at me for the portrait. Okay. Sorry. I'm really sorry. I have to go now. Actually, I'm done. That was quick. I could have done it quicker. I see. If you don't like it, I can do another... How about I come again next week? Can you paint one like that? See you later. Wait a minute, there's something on your face. Who is that guy? The one making her smile? Down comes the rain and he's not coming. It wasn't rain that I was waiting for... Jeong Woo? Interpol! How have you been? Oh, this. It's just a sprain. It will be fine in a few days. What happened? It rained so hard yesterday, and I slipped. Did you wait long yesterday? Huh? No. I didn't... ...only a little. Good. I didn't want you to have to wait in the rain. I see. Shall we begin? Shall we begin what? The oil painting. Didn't you say you wanted one? Oh, yes. Right. Do you want to have that painted as well? As you like. Do you like this pose? How about this? I like spending time with him. How's it going? Wow, it looks better than I do. The stubble is a little... Flowers! Here. Can I come in? Is this for sale, too? Yes. But it's a fake. - Except the picture. - I like it. How did you know I was here? I know everything. I want this. How much is it? Just take it. It's a gift. That's no way to do business. No, really. Just take it. Well, then... Why not take this in exchange? I thought you might have a hard time finding good kimchi. Here. Wow, this looks delicious! I've made it myself. It tastes good. Did you paint all these yourself? Yes. Must have used lots of paint. Here's your coffee. - Here. - Oh, yes. I thought you spilled coffee on this. That's not you. ...Im sure you said you spilled coffee on that. Funny... I could have sworn that was me. Wow, what's that place? That spring, I went there to paint the daisies for an exhibition. For me, daisies are like little sunflowers. Van Gogh painted sunflowers. I paint daisies... Van Gogh was the one who made me want to be a painter. After the fall, I was too scared to cross the wooden bridge... ...so I took a detour. But later, I found a new bridge. At first, I thought it was a coincidence. But then I felt that someone built this bridge just for me. The next day, somebody took my painting. I think it was the person who built the bridge for me... ...because after that, somebody began sending me daisies. Flowers! I am looking outside the window, hoping to see the deliveryman. But there is no one there. So I painted him as a shadow. I've been waiting for him. And... I think I've found him. I couldn't tell her I was not the one. Instead of lying... ...or telling her the truth... ...I chose silence. Our duty is... ...to track down drug traffickers operating between Asia and Amsterdam. Hello Sir, Do you want to pay? Do you want to have flowers? Ok, thank you. Bye. From here... ...I can see everything in their hideout, the pharmacy... ...and not worry about being seen since she blocks me. Oh, I'm not done yet. The second time I sat by her... ...I felt she has some feelings for me. Fortunately, it was just a petty thief. I'm lucky my cover wasn't blown. By now they must know I'm here. I know I'm putting her in danger by being close to her. But I couldn't help myself. How's it going? Here's a present. I wish I am the man she is been waiting for. It's been a week... ...a week without flowers. Maybe he's afraid of me. Now that you can see me, no flowers seem necessary. I can draw you by memory now. How much do you know about me, Hye Young? You're a Korean businessman working in the Netherlands. Your name is Jeong Woo, and you're about 30 something years old. Oh, and you make very good kimchi. What if... ...I didn't make that kimchi? Would you still care for me? What do you mean? Hey! Are you okay? Take care of her please. Hello! Are you all right? Are you... Oh. Hey! Hey! Casualty! Casualty! We need an ambulance! Ambulance! Casualty! Casualty! Casualty! We need an ambulance! Ambulance! I lost my voice from the stray bullet and the shock. They told me Jeong Woo was injured and sent back to Korea. But I can't believe it. And when these wither, Fresh ones will arrive. Right? So, how are you doing today? Okay. Smart, so you don't have to write them out each time. So, no more sign language lessons then? Take care. One... To welcome me back to work, my grandpa takes pictures. There's a man standing across the street in the picture... Jeong Woo... Why wouldn't he come and see me? Hello. Yes, I'm Korean. You must be Korean, too? Oh, okay. Make a good portrait please. She looked so heartbroken... ...so I couldn't stay behind anymore. Are you okay? I am sorry. I will paint another one. It's ok. Maybe it's better if I come again later. No, no. Draw me next time. Hi, are you leaving now? Let me take you home. It's okay. Give it to me. Get in. It's ok. I'm with her now. I'm taking her home... I am taking her home. I live nearby. Hello. I just stopped by on my way home. Give it to me. Let's go together. Since I can't speak... ...he plays music for me. But I am still waiting for Jeong Woo. I have no place for him in my heart. Choi... Dae... Chi... Yeo-Ok... Wait... for me? Black tulips... ...remind me of who I am. Killer's girl could be a bait and target. Would you like to have dinner with me tonight? Sure, I know a great restaurant. I'm sorry, would you mind waiting a little while? I've got something to do. I'll be back soon. Please don't go, stay here. I'm used to waiting. My grandpa said my parents would come, but they didn't. And because of you, Jeong Woo, I'm used to waiting. Sorry, the power has just gone out. It will be back in 5 minutes. Everybody please don't worry. We'll bring you some candles. Sorry I kept you waiting so long. Thank you for being so nice. I'm sorry, but I am in love with someone else already. I like your paintings... ...and I just want us to be friends. He built a bridge for me and sent me daisies every day. Jeong Woo... I think he blames himself for what happened to me. But he doesn't understand that losing him... ...is so much more painful than losing my voice. I didn't do anything for him. I never even thanked him. April 15... He promised to come to my exhibition. I'm waiting for him. It's no use in just waiting. Why haven't we heard anything from him? He's not seriously injured. But I'm afraid he's not allowed to leave the country anymore. Could you give us his address? I am really sorry but I can't. If you have a message for him, you can give it to me. Wait a minute. This is a storage room. Oh, this... This is from a friend. Do you like classical music? Have something to drink. About Impressionism Yes. Here's Monet. I like Monet. Monet's paintings are dreamlike. They make you imagine things. Yes? Can I use these daisies for the exhibition? Of course! Let's go to the headquarters. I want to see Hye Young first. You're still out of your mind. Do you know how hard I worked to get you back here? And how many times did I tell you that it wasn't your fault she got hurt? You were injured in the line of duty. Don't feel guilty. I'm going to tell her the truth everything. Damn, you're driving me crazy. That's all well and good... ...but it's too late. There is a new guy with her now. Hello, this is Hye Young Kim. Please leave a message, and I'll call you back. Please leave a message and I'll call you back. Thank you. Jeong Woo... ...why doesn't he say anything? I can't speak, but I can hear if he talks. Is it too late for me to come? I saw this somewhere, and I bought it for you. How about a cup of coffee? I'm sorry that it's been so long since I last saw you. I was too busy at work and got stuck in Korea. How have you been? Yes. Yes I'm fine. I was in this area and... Why? I'm sorry that... ...I never told you the truth. I am... ...Im a cop. I used you... during an investigation... ...and got you injured. I felt so guilty that... I didn't have the courage to see you. But I think it's time for me... ...to apologize to you formally. I am truly sorry. She lost her voice... ...and I lost her. I've found some clues about the guy who shot you. But I thought all we know is that he is Asian. There were no fingerprints in the apartment. The bullets - 5.56 subsonic with a silencer. So that's why we didn't hear the sound of gunfire. That's right! He's a professional killer. He's probably behind the killings at the hotel and the theater... ...over the last few weeks. He probably belongs to a group of professional killers for hire I've asked some guys to look into how these killers are contracted. And? What do you mean "and"? We can hire him. We'll wait for him and catch him. Where do we get the money? The boss won't approve it. I'm not proud of this, but... I won some money at the slots recently. I'll never get promoted if I don't catch this guy. Detective Jang! Are you out of your mind? So for this plan to work, you need to hire the assassin? What if he succeeds? It might be okay if you put a contract on yourself? You must be kidding. I have a family to look after Then you can hire him to kill me that'll solve everything. What the... Want some coffee? Hye Young This is for me. I told a friend I'd come here. Please get in. He's a cop. It's not an easy assignment, but the client specifically asked for you. We're in a business where... ...we must never say "No" to a client. Don't worry. I will always be there to back you up. I heard you've been seeing someone lately. You need money for the girl just like I need you for the job. Suspect approaching, suspect approaching! It's okay. He's a friend. What? - Hello. - Hello. - What a place to meet you. - Yes. May I talk to you? Sure, hop in. Why don't you have lunch? I'll be back right away. Hey! Where you going? Jeong Woo!! I just need a few minutes. No, it's dangerous to stay there. Hye Young told me a lot about you. Really? I feel so bad about Hye Young. I can be quite careless sometimes. I didn't really mean it. I knew you were sincere. The music is too loud. Can we listen to something else? Sure. How did he know it was me from behind the car If you're the assassin... ...what will happen to Hye Young? You could have just shot me. I wonder how you recognized me. Am I not your target? Do you think I won't shoot you? I don't know if you'll shoot me or not. But I know I can. Try it. I don't have to try. Neither do I. Did you forget who you are? You're the good guy. I'm the bad guy. You are not here to kill me. Why? For Hye Young. Not for yourself? I should've stayed out of her sight in the first place. You're the daisy guy? She doesn't know it yet. Do you know how long she's waited for you? Only before you came along. You should be going to the exhibition today. How about you? Unless you arrest me... ...I'll disappear. Hye Young! What's going on? Jeong Woo... ...has been killed in the line of duty. In Memory of Jeong Woo I feel sorry about it, but I draw whenever I think of Jeong Woo. It makes me less lonely. She sketches me... ...probably only because she feels sorry. But, still, there I am within her reach. This part, this part is really interesting. I'm leaving tomorrow. I've seen it a hundred times, but it's still sad every time. Do you understand. I only have got you. I can read what you're saying. Say something Just try. Try it! "Can you really read my lips?" Is that what you said? He's not lonely at all. He must be glad that you are here. It's been a year but I still don't know what has happened. Before he was murdered, he told me he met a friend... ...and they left together My only clue was his car stereo... ...it was playing classical music. Jeong Woo never listened to that kind of stuff. That means his friend changed it. And he's missing. We've also learned that the killers received black tulips when they are contracted. Do you like classical music? It's been a year. How have you been? I'm fine. Your position has been compromised. That Interpol detective Jang is on to you. Didn't I tell you falling for a woman is like pointing a gun at yourself? Forget about the mistake you made a year ago. This is your last chance. Your girlfriend suspects you. This is a storage room. Dinner is almost ready. Have some tea. Drink before it gets cold. It'll warm you up. I'm sorry, get some sleep for now Your grandpa will be late. He wants us to eat together. Do you like beef? I hope so... You'll find out tomorrow. I'm sorry. Nine minutes, all unit standby. Report your status. Okay, got tha, take cover for Zone A then. I'm sorry. At first... ...I just wanted to help this lovely young woman. I built a bridge, then you gave me a painting. And I started sending daisies But the bridge I built became a bridge between you and him. Later... I could see you so sad after he'd left. That's why... I showed up. Now I'll give your heart back. Alpha set Beta set Charlie, do you copy? Charlie set. What are you doing here? It's dangerous here. Get out of the way. Hurry Who is the girl? Okay. I know her. Don't worry. I got it. Stop it... Stop it... Do you see this painting? You made me so happy. This painting, I gave it to you. I'm sorry... I'm sorry I didn't recognize you. Now I know that you're the one I've been waiting for... I need help. I need help! Somebody help me! Take away. Take away! Hye Young I'm right here. Leave them alone! I'm sorry. I couldn't... I don't deserve you I'm sorry I hurt you. Jeong Woo... I'm sorry I let Jeong Woo die. All I wanted was to make you happy I'm sorry. The love I've been dreaming of... ... is all so close to me. But all I can do is... ... just watching you without words. In this city of strangers... ... I lived day by day painting love. Waiting and hoping that you'll be here... ... with the scent of daisies. It is too late but now... ... I finally recognize you. But maybe we were not meant to be. I never wanted to let this love fly away. But I am sorry I have to leave... ... with you still breathing here. No, not yet. I'm sorry. No, no. Let's start again. We'll start again. No, we'll start again. We'll start again. No!
