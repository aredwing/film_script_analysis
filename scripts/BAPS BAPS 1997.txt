I want to see y'all down at my club... the Gold Tooth... the place to be on Saturday night with Dr. D. Coming up next, we're going to give you... the 411 from MTV vj Idalis, so stay where you're at. Why did you have to burn my toast, baby? Now, you know you said you wanted everything well-done. And you know I didn't. All right there, Nate. Girl, don't pay him no mind. He think he dolomite. What's good on the menu? Nothing. There you go, Nate. Just the way you like it. Hey, Georgia, this is Idalis from MTV... with a hot tip from you Southern gals. Heavy D is looking for one special girl who can dance... has a great spirit, and loves to travel... to be the video dance girl of the world for his new video. And get this, the lucky winner gets $10,000 in cash. You heard that right. Auditions are this week in L. A... So get a pen and paper... Nisi? You're daydreaming again. No, no, no, I was taking their order. Uh-uh. It's my second time I done told you. I'm taking $10 out of your doggone pay. Ohh, Mr. Johnson! Ohh! $10? I don't want to hear nothing, Nisi. Not another word, another phrase, another syllable. Hey! Shut up! I'm the captain of this doggone ship. If it's too hot in the kitchen, Nisi, leave. If the shoe fit, wear it. If it too tight, take it off! I can't believe Ali and James stand us up again. I'm through with them, girl. Now, you see what I mean? I ain't got nothing to lose. What you mean you ain't got nothing to lose? You talking about using all the money we have... to go to some audition in California. Nisi, you ain't even a dancer. I am a dancer, and I'll be dancin' my butt off... for some $10,000. Now, if I get this job, Mick... we're going to have more than enough money... for the salon and the restaurant. You ain't using our life savings... to go to California on some maybe mission. Your life is right here. We don't deserve this. We deserve the best. That's why you got me. And you... You got me. Aw, come on, baby, I'm sorry I'm late... but, you know, sometimes businessmen stuff can't wait. Well, you can just keep your '"Sorry'"... because you're a sorry excuse for a boyfriend. Hold on, hold on, hold on now. You ain't know why we late, girl. I don't know that y'all couldn't show up here on time... to walk us home from work. We've been checking out this classic 1935 Ford... Eric's grandfather's selling. That's right, and he's gonna sell it to us... half the price. If he was giving it away, it still wouldn't matter. Y'all ain't got no jobs. We've been thinking about putting applications in... for the last month, baby... but, you know, the buses don't run everywhere. But, look here, we're gonna buy the car... and we're gonna start our own... page-a-cab luxury cab company. Oh, no. Come on, Mick. Bye. Hey, come on, come on. Nisi, why you act like that? Ali, I guess I'm tired... of hearing about all your pipe dreams. If you really cared about me... you would get rid of that tired perm... I've been telling you about forever. Oh, I don't cut my hair! I ain't cutting the hair, no. If anything, I'm gonna bring the perm back. I was so mad, I just walked out. And he said that was his cousin? That's what he said. Bopping around here with that cracked up perm he got. You know he's wrong. Girl, why won't he let you cut his hair? I don't know. I've been trying forever. Now, I'm a hairdresser, right? And my man walking around here... Iooking like a broke-down Superfly. No. No, Superfly's little brother. Right, right. Superflea. - Ow! - Be still then! Shoot, you said you wanted these pompoms, so you got 'em. Girl, we need to move on... and we need to get us some new jobs. Hey, what's up, kids? Idalis kickin' it MTV style. Listen, y'all, I got the inside scoop... on the biggest video audition to hit the airwaves... since the artist formerly known as Prince... was looking for that special girl for his video... The Most Beautiful Girl in the World. Remember that? Well, Heavy D is doing a unique video himself. He's going to be shooting this video all over the world... in beautiful, exotic places like Brazil and Italy. He's looking for that oh, so special girl... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go back. A great body, a great smile... and that twinkle in her eye. He's looking for... - Look! - Huh? So, that's the same audition! Girl? I think it's a sign from God. My mama always told me good things come in 3. I heard it on the radio, now read it in a magazine... and now it's on TV! This is it, Mick! Nisi, you buggin'. But what if I ain't? Come on, Mick. Let's go to L.A. Let's do it. Hell, yeah... 'cause there ain't nothing but some fine young rich men in L.A. I feel like partying right now. Come on. Partying? We've got to try to save every penny now. Uh-uh. It's Tuesday night. You know what that means. Ladies night at the Gold Tooth. We get in free! Go, go. Git it, git it. Go, go. Git it, git it. I want everyone to have their I.D.s. Ready. It's just so ridiculous. Everybody in here want to be a player, pimp, hustler. Not me. I just want a simple woman. That's you. I'm telling you it's you. Oh, really? You're very special to me. You see, I never met nobody like you before in my life. Your name is etched in my heart. Shakima, right? Keesha? Mm-hmm... I went to school with her. All right, step forward. Ooh, damn! Fine and vivacious and beautiful. Y'all look gooda-than-a-mug! That's what he's trying to say. Thank you. Nisi, ain't you thirsty? Yeah, let me get 4 hurricanes, bro. Ooh, now, y'all look good not like these hootchy girls. Y'all got class. Like waitresses or something. That'll be $16 even. Hell, no. Let's go. I ain't thirsty. Come on, let's go to the bathroom. Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute. Hold it... hold it, girl. Now, look, it was ladies night, right? Y'all didn't have to pay to get in. Y'all could have bought our drinks. Uh, not in this life. Now, hold on. I ain't finished talking to you. Will you let go of her arm? You ain't her damn daddy. Shut your ass up, you playa-hatin' heifer. Get off me. Hey, what you... what did I do? Oh, what you gonna do, captain save-a-ho? Humm? Oh, no, it's on now, brother. Get on up!

Oh, he good for it. They good for it. That'll be $16 even. Oh, hell, no! Come on, Mick. Come on, it's ladies night! - Nisi! - Y'all got in free. Nisi! What's your problem? Why you treating me like some stepchild? Because I deserve better than this, Ali. Don't you think I know that, baby? I'm a businessman. I'm trying to make things happen. You've been trying to make things happen forever now. You can't even keep a job. I want a real man... a man with ambition, goals, real dreams. I got dreams. What you think my page-a-cab luxury cab service is? You ain't even got a driver's license. Like your dreams are just wired for sound... and ready to roll, right? Owning a hair salon. That's you and Mickey's problem. You need to get a grip on life. I ain't never heard somebody owning a restaurant... with a hair salon in back. What kind of bullshit is that? Oh... all right. Well, that's gonna happen. You'll see. Nisi, Nisi, Nisi... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Come on, baby. They're playing our song. Used to be our song. Nisi, do you think you overdid it with our hair? Mm-mmm. Nope. I sure don't because we're going to Beverly Hills. Now, if I'm going to do good at that audition... we've got to look like stars. Nisi! - Nisi! - What, girl? Can't you see I'm trying to read up on our manners? I know, but we're going to need more than manners... because right here it says... that the rich and famous people hang out at the Polo Lounge. So? - So?! Oh, shit. We don't know nothin' about playing no damn polo. Then look up in the book... and see if you can find a basketball lounge. - Yeah! - Yeah! Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Our in-flight movie is about to begin. Please lower your shade if you're sitting next to a window. Thank you. - Where my thing at? - Hey, I can't see. Miss? What's going on? What's blocking the screen? - I paid money to see this. - I can't see! Please, can I have another seat? I'll pay you any amount of money. I'm sorry. The flight is all booked up. Aw, fuck! Hello? Ladies, would you mind lowering your hair? No problem. It's beautiful. Maybe you overdid it just a little bit. Maybe I did, huh? Can I get my money back for these headphones? Oh, there, there. That's much better. The white zone is for the immediate loading and unloading... Oh, shit, lady, look! Nis, look! - LL! LL! - LL! LL! Damn! Lady love in the flesh! Ain't nothing like a brother who practices what he preaches. Remember we read in right on magazine... he done married his baby's mama! - Sure did! - You're a good man, too.

Manley will do very nicely, thank you. Who is Alfred? You know. Batman's homeboy. Oh, you right, girl. I see what you're saying. You would be so good in the sequel! - Oh, he'd be phat! - He would!

Now, uh, before we begin... well, there's just one little thing I have to tell you. I'm not making a music video. I just didn't know how else I was going to find... an actress like yourself. I can act, too! This job involves... And old man who is dying from cancer. Oh, that's sad. Know what's even sadder? He was never able to marry... the one woman that he truly loved. Why come? Because he's white... and she was black. She was the housekeeper at the family's estate. Her name was Lily. - Oh, that's who I'm going to play? - Well, not quite. When his family discovered their relationship... they separated them. They immediately married him off to a white woman. And he never saw Lily again. Anyway, he's dying... and the only family that he has left is his nephew. That's me. Sorry. I'm his nephew. Uh, and when I learned... that he has less than 2 weeks to live... well, I decided that maybe I should try and find the love of his life. Find Lily. That is so sweet of you. Well, it was also impossible. But, seems I have managed to find... Lily's granddaughter. - Oh, that's who I'm going to play. - Yes. Yes, exactly. Well, my idea was... You know how much your grandmother loved him... so, you show up here... out of the goodness of your heart. You just do anything and everything that you can... to make sure that his final days... are filled with... with kindness and love. - Bravo. - Man. - That's beautiful. - Aw, I'm glad you think so. So, if you'd be so kind as to follow me. Right this way. Uncle Don, I have a surprise for you. I'd like you to meet Denise. Denise is Lily's granddaughter. Why didn't you tell me they were coming? How dare you bring them in like this. How dare you! No. Put... get... get out. Get out. Nisi, let's not get scared. We can handle that old man. We gonna get this $10,000 and make all our dreams come true. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my god. This is the bomb. It's the bomb. OK. We going to get this money. Let's go to dinner. He said it was this way. Come on! I'm sorry I scared you. I meant it as a surprise. It's all right, Isaac. Just don't ever do that to me again. I won't. Well, hello there. Have a seat. Forgive me for my behavior earlier. I'm sorry if I was rude. I... I don't like surprises. So... I can't tell you how happy I am to have you in my home. The first years of my life were touched by the magic of Lily. I welcome you. I suppose she told you all about life on the estate. Yeah, she did. What exactly did she say? Uh, well, she... told me about the trees. There were wonderful trees. There was this beautiful, majestic oak as you drove... That's the one. The oak. She told us about the oak, didn't she? Ah, here's dinner. Thanks. Thank you, Manley. What's this? I'm only permitted to eat certain foods. No wonder why you sick. I don't mean to be rude, but you ain't dead yet. You can still eat hearty. What she mean is... you can still eat hearty and be healthy, too. You sound just like Lily. There's no food like soul food. You right about that. Ain't no food like soul food. Excuse me. - Give me your plate. - What? Give me your plate. Yes. Off the request lines from L.A. Do you think Ali and James miss us? I don't know, but I know I miss my man. You need to scoot over, because I ain't got no problem... sleeping on this expensive white carpet because I know it's poodle hair. Excuse me. I must talk to you. Oh, yes, Antonio! I'm coming! Hold on. - Antonio. - Mickey. - Antonio. - Mickey. Perhaps we can go someplace private. Hold on. You need to go take a cold shower like I told you to. Come with me, bellissima. Hey, hey! You said we came down here to talk. No more lies. I felt that maybe you were feeling the same thing that I feel for you. You were? We are destiny, I'm convinced. - We are? - Si, bellissima. But I have a secret. Well, got on ahead, Antonio. You can tell me. My family is very wealthy. For real? I came to America to find somebody who likes me for me. Somebody like you. You got some money? More money than you can spend in one lifetime. Oh, please let me try in this lifetime, please. I will. I promise. I need to go now. Until we meet again. Arrivederci. Aria derchi to you, too. And some mozzarella and fettuccini. Hell, yeah. I swear to God it ain't no dream. I know you think he's just hired help but it's all an act. Well, if he's so rich... why did he have to come all the way to America to find his wife? I don't know. But I ain't got no rock on my finger... so I say we keep shopping for our babies' daddies. And may the fattest wallet him. I tell you, Master Isaac, they're disrupting M. Blakemore's diet. They're poisoning him with this soul food as he calls it. Mm-mmm, he love Mickey's soul food. My soul food is created to nourish the soul, OK? I ain't used pork since Thelma was on Good Times... about to marry Ebay the African prince, 'cause he didn't eat pork in his food and I said no, no, no. I'm waiting on my African prince... to be my baby's daddy, so I stopped using pork... because I started using chicken broth. I could be doing that. So I don't know what you talking about. See, what I cook is much healthier than that bird stuff Alfred is cooking for him. The name is Manley, thank you. I spoke with the nutritionist this morning. And he warned me that this so-called soul food... has been know to clog the arteries, cramp the colon... and eventually stop the heart. Is that true? Mm-mmm, not the way she do it. - Good grief, would you look at that? - Yes. Let me have that from you. You're alarming me a little bit. I want you to relax. I think you're overreacting. Ladies, I want you to continue to cook... whatever you think is going to make my uncle happy. And if there's anything else you need from the store... well, I'm sure that Manley will be more than delighted to go get it for you. Oh, you think he could go by the record store? Oh, sure. And don't forget my Ice Cube cd, Manley. Good morning, everybody. How are you? Isaac, good to see you. Ah, I don't know what you put in that meal last night... but I feel great. Excuse me. What's for breakfast? Excuse me. Excuse me, please. I wonder if you could help me. Oh, yeah, yeah. You're looking for the classical section, back there by the jazz. No, no, no, no.

He says you're tripping because you're in Hollywood... and he hopes you don't get played. Oh, I'm tripping, and he hope I don't get played? Tell him he better hop his mama don't get played. Hello, sir. She hopes your mama don't get played. Wait a moment, sir. - Yes, she is, as a matter of fact. - What? He asked if you were biting your lip. Yes, yes. But that's truly extraordinary, isn't it? All right, sir, I will. Good night now. What he say? Well, he said he's sorry, maybe he's tripping... but he misses you very much on the real. Good night, Miss. On the real. This little piggy ate the ravioli. Why you wearing them gloves in the house? Because, my love, your skin is too soft... to suffer the roughness of my hard-working hands. You are so sweet. Wait, wait, wait, whoa. Wait. I ain't doing that till I get married. You putting a ring on this finger? A ring? I already have a ring. You do? Come with me. Mr. Blakemore was kind enough to let me keep the ring safe in here. - Ready? - Yes. I can't open it. Oh, OK. Well, let me try. Let me try. What's the combo? - 5 left. - 5 left. - Zero right. - Zero right. And 10 left. It's not opening, is it? That's not it. It's all right, bellissima. I will verify the code with Mr. Blakemore in the morning. Promise? Promise. OK. Have a good night. Sleep tight. Welcome to the British Overseas Network. The following BBC program can be heard again on Thursday at... Oh, so you stealing, huh? I'm going to have to beat you like you stole something then. Oh, I'm going to have to hit you hard, like Tyson. Nisi? Ooh, what? Nisi? Ooh! Ha ha ha. What? Tyson wouldn't hit him like that. He wouldn't? No. He'd hit him like this. Oh, no, no, no. You ain't seen his last fight... 'cause you was in the kitchen getting popcorn. Tyson... would do it like... This! No, Tyson... Would really hit him like... - this! - This! Yeah, come on. Antonio. What's going on here? What is this? Help me out. Help you out? I'm calling the police. The three of you are stealing from my uncle. No, the girls had nothing to do with it. - It was Antonio. - Antonio? Isaac, our plan can still work. It will be our words against theirs. Her fingerprints are still on the safe, man. I beg your pardon? I don't know what you're talking about. What plan? I'm calling the police. Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry. Look what you've done, you little skeezers! Skeezers? Uh-huh. Now, I'm going to have to spank that ass like Tyson. I said come on! And stay on your feet! And he was there, and he hit me from behind. Well, that was that. I'll report more fully to you in the morning and, I promise I'll be there as early as I can. Thank you so much, officer. Oh, for goodness sake, let's go. I'll read you your rights. You have the right to remain silent. Hello? You there? Come on, look at me. Look at me! Did you say right or fight? Right. You have the right to remain slient. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. I don't know how he slept through all that. You think he's still alive? I don't know. Maybe we should check his pulse. Wait a minute, you took a CPR class, didn't you? Yeah. 'Cause all the cute guys was in there. No! Didn't you learn anything? No. But I did meet James. We're going to check his heart to see if it's still beating. Go on, you check it. You check it. - You check it. - You check it. You check it. It's on your side. He's alive. I'm going to bed. Nisi? Nisi? That's OK. We got it. Hello. Good morning. I'm Tracy Shaw, Mr. Blakemore's attorney. Look, here, we ain't had nothing to do with what happened last night. I swear to God. Oh, I know. And if anybody says differently... you make sure you have them call me. Everything is OK now. Thank God we caught this before Isaac went too far. I received this package from his attorney this morning. Mr. Blakemore... Isaac has filed documents of incompetency against you. I guess once he got the photos he needed... this girls were no longer of any value to him. He claims you befriended two girls from the ghetto... after you caught them trying to break into your home. You then moved the girls into your home... and, for a lack of a better phrase... you've been allowing them to rob you blind. How dare he! Girl, I can't believe Isaac would do this to Mr. Blakemore. Yeah, that is kind of messed up. Mickey, Nisi, it was a pleasure meeting the both of you. How's he doing? Does he want something to eat? I think he just needs to rest right now. - He will be fine. Good-bye. - Bye. All he needs is energy. Remember when I told you... my grandmama used to make my granddaddy a special drink... that would get him going? Yeah? But didn't you tell me that is not only got him up... but that it got him... up? Up is up. I don't know how we're going to get him to drink all them egg yolks. The same way my grandmama did. Ladies, I didn't hear you come in. - Hi. - Hi. Hello. We decided to make you a breakfast drink. You didn't have to do that. But we wanted to. We're sorry about what happened last night. Yeah. Yeah, so am I. Please have a seat. Money. Money makes people do the strangest things. Isaac brought you here for his own selfish reasons... but did he promise you anything? Like a fee? - Wasn't no fee involved, was there? - No. We here because we want to be. Which is all the more reason why you should have these. - $50,000? - Holy shit! I mean shoot. Uh-uh, Mr. B. Ain't no way we could take this. We're here because we want to be. You know, until this very second... the only person I ever totally trusted in my entire life was Lily. I feel like dancing. Go, go! Get it! Get it! Let's get this party jumpin'! West Side! The roof! The roof! The roof is on fire! Mr. B, you OK? Let's go sit down. You don't look so good. You feeling kind of dizzy? Let's sit him down right here. Right here. OK, I'm fine, really. You sure? I just got a little short of breath for a second. I'm OK. You was getting down out there, Mr. B. I think it's time for us to go home. Yeah, 'cause Manley's embarrassing us. So that's why we made you fall out. Let's go. Come on. We had no idea you could dance like that, Mr. B. I haven't had this much fun since I used to dance with Lily. You girls are truly amazing. Ah, Lily. Lily, what a lady. What a lady. Oh, I'm sorry you didn't meet the man of your dreams tonight... but maybe next time. That's OK. I've known him since high school anyway. Oh? His name is Ali. He's back in Georgia. I really love him, too. What's the problem, then? Ali don't have no dreams... no drive, no ambition. Nothing. Just like me. No, it's true. I almost lost all of my dreams when I was a very young man. Fortunately, there was a... a skinny, bowlegged girl who was filled with dreams. Everything I have today is because of her. I mean, I had no ambition. But she had enough for the both of us. What do you mean by that? Well, she always dreamt about becoming a clothing designer... and I loved her so much that... Oh, so that's how you got interested in the fabric business. Yeah. Well, who was she? Your grandmother. See, that's what I'm... talking about. - Ali is different. - Nisi... This is no fortune worth the loss of a true love. Some things are priceless. Where have you been? You know, you've been acting strange ever since we got home. What's up with you, Nisi? Nisi?! What? I've been thinking, OK... about how we going to get up out of here. - What? - Don't act like you don't know, Mickey. The guilt... the guilt of what we doing. Now, that old man down there is a nice old man. And he ain't got nothing around him but people trying to use him... like you and me. I know. Why do you think I got up and left. We should've been done got up and left. D, don't you think that we could at least say good-bye? - We can't. - Why? Cause if I go to him and I say we leaving... he going to say, '"Why? '" And I'm going to have to tell him... that you and me been a part of this whole big lie. I can't do it. So we're going to write him a letter... and we're going to tell him the truth, everything. - Everything? - Everything! What time is it? Why are you still up? I guess I can't sleep. You go on, go back to bed. Flight don't leave for another 7 hours. I'm going to be downstairs. Hey, D... what we going to do when we get off that plane? We ain't got no money, no apartment, nothin'. We worse than when we started out. Maybe, but maybe not. Some things is priceless, you know, Mick? Excuse me, Miss. It was never my intention to involve myself in your private affairs... or to come off like a player-hater... but I have become a kind of a middleman... and I think it's high time... that you two talked with each other, face to face. I took your advice and decided to help myself. How did you get here, Ali? Your boy Alfred hooked me up. He called me late last night and insisted that we come out right away. - We? James here, too? - Yeah. Nisi, I don't know if you want to stay here... if you want to go home, or what you want to do. All I know is I've had one dream... and one dream only since high school... And that's... and that's to be with you. Come on, they're playing our song. You know what? Everything you said about me was true. I do need to change. So from now on... I promise you, I'm going to change. For real? For real. This... this is the kind of stuff you deserve. But I just... I just can't give it to you. I mean, you... you deserve nice stuff. You deserve a big old house... and... and... you... you... you... you... deserve your... your own backyard. And... every... everybody else got a little white dog. Why... why you can't have one? I want to take you out to dinner... and... and every time we go out, we got to watch... other people eat. Hell, I want to eat, too. And you need... you need some clothes. Why... why should you have to wear your Sunday clothes... on... on Wednesday? Now, look, girl... don't think... don't think the brother a punk... because he crying like a little girl, but... You're my queen. And... I... love... Love you! James, you ain't never said nothing like this. - Don't say it if you don't mean it. - I mean it! Girl, what's wrong with you? I'm sorry, James! I said I mean it! Come on! Oh, dear. Hurry, hurry. Oh, oh! Thank you! Thank you! Sir, please, can I get in there? It's all right. It's all right. Don't panic. Manley's here. Nisi, hurry up. They just took Mr. B to the hospital. Come on, hurry! I'm glad you came. I... I want to thank you for everything that you've done. I, uh... You was the one who was about the money, not us. I can't believe that Mr. B is related... Speaking of relatives, how's Lily? Oh, Mickey, Nisi, come, please. You're going to be OK. Mr. B... I, uh, um... I ain't Lily's... Mr. B? We're losing him. Get Dr. Russell in here now. Get me Dr. Jennings down here immediately. Give me a hand, will you, doctor? Uh, nurse, get a respirator over here. Mr. Blakemore, can you hear me? - Oxygen, oxygen. - Mr. Blakemore? I didn't get a chance to tell him. About Lily? You didn't have to. He already knew. You see, Lily never had any children. Go up there and look at the picture. Look at the picture. Now, who the picture remind you of? Loquisha Jenkins! Yecch, that's so ugly. There she go, right there. This all your stuff here? Don't drag it. I'm not gonna drag it. You ready to go? Wait a minute. I... I wish you a very pleasant journey. Flying first class is extremely comfortable. So I've been told. We shall miss you. We're gonna miss you, too. Thank you for everything. Manley. Alfred will do very nicely, thank you. We should get going. Not yet. I'm glad I caught you. This will only take a second. Please, follow me. I just have a document. I'd like to review with you all. Good morning to you. Oh, you're still here? Good morning, Isaac. This is Mr. Blakemore's last will and testament. '"First... '" Mr. Blakemore states... '"I'd like to thank my B.A.P. S Nisi and Mickey... '"for making the last days of my life as pleasant as my first year.'" Oh, that's sweet. B.A.P. S? Black American Princesses. Uh, yeah. Please continue. They have a plane to catch. Of course. '"Second, I, Donald William Blakemore... Being of sound heart and mind... Hereby request the affairs of my estate... To be incontestably implemented as follows: To my B.A.P. S I leave...
