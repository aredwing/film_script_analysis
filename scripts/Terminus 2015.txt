It means rebirth. Renacimiento renacimiento. Rebirth of what? Renacimiento... You said he was blind. Yes... he was. Can you show me where it landed? (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) We're too late. DAVID (V.O.): This place is changing. Everyone in town's nervous... but, like you say, nothing bad ever lasts, right? Annie's coming to visit. I was hoping we could take a road trip. You'd be so proud of her, you know. So proud. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.): Headlining news this morning, protests continue around... the nation following approval of the President's draft bill... pledging over 100,000 additional troops to Operation Terminus... the ongoing occupation of Iran. Russian and Chinese Foreign Ministers have intensified warnings... against the United States as the President maintains resolve. [TONY] Last week it was braces. Yesterday, Ritalin. [MICKEY] Trading stocks, man, that's my game. You assholes gonna do any work today? Oh, yeah, we're over-friggin-whelmed here. Hey. J.C.'s Trans-Am needs a transmission overhaul. New exhaust... nitrogen in the tires. - It's a long shot. - Yeah. Three days to order the parts. Two days bank shuts us down. 22 years I've been helping this town run on wheels. - Doesn't have to end like this, Ned. - You kidding me? I'll be paying this shit-storm off for the next 22 years, if I don't file Chapter 7 now. We ain't asking for a handout. Boys'll put in the work, you know that, but fuck, Ned, we need our jobs. David, it's over. Done. Well, I'll see if Ramon's got any exhausts lying around. Fix J.C.'s Trans-Am, maybe that keeps the doors open another couple days. Yeah. Do what you want. She's something. Yeah, she's a crying shame. You the boss around here? If you're looking for a job, you're in the wrong place. Tony, let's go. I did three years as a field engineer with the ninth. Yep. I just need a chance. We all do. REPORTER (ON TV): General Corazon estimates casualty rates to drop... once draft reinforcements complete training. Jesus, Dad! I'm cutting you off. Just go home. No... Come on, Mickey. - You can ride with me. Come on. - No. Come on. You too, Mr. Chamberlain. Come on. Last one. REPORTER (ON TV): As you can see, the occupation relies... on strategic strong-holds along the Afghan-Iranian border. A swathe of Russian-endorsed guerilla fighters continued across the Hindu Kush... from Pakistan to conduct raids on US bases. H2O... on the rocks. Hey. Bourbon, double. REPORTER (ON TV): The daily casualty rate has risen to 23. So when'd the U.S. Army become target practice for Arabs... and cannon fodder for Jews? Should send me over. I'll teach 'em how to fight. Bunch of goddamned pussies. Used to have standards. Now they'll take anyone. Queers, Mexicans. Mexican queers. No wonder we're losing. What the fuck would you know about it? Huh? You should sign up. They'd love you. Okay, princess... let's go. - Goddamn Tyson. - Here we go again. Hey! Come on, guys, leave him alone! You son of a... What the hell? He's got a goddamn fake leg! He's a goddamn cripple. Shit! Ah, man. Screw this. Let's get out of here. Here. (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING) Hey. Get in. Come on. What did you think was gonna happen back there? - How long were you over there? - You know what your problem is? You're like every other hick in this town. Full of opinions on things you know nothing about. Scared shitless of losing what you think you have. - And what's that? - A future. - A future? - Yeah. I'm not the one picking fights I know I can't win. Asshole. Pull in here. Shit. Guess you forgot. What happened? Accident. Looks worse than it is. When'd you get in? This afternoon, like we talked about. I'll clean you up. Lot of luggage for one week. I'm staying. How long? You quit... why? I don't want to talk about it, not while you're like this. Like what? Disappointed? What happened? Some boy break your heart? No. Well, I didn't send you out there to quit, Annabelle. I've been busting my ass every damn day in that shop so you can have a future. I didn't quit. Your last two payments didn't go through. Shit. So my... I'm sorry. I just need another week. I'll call them, fix it. - Forget it. - No, I'll take care of it. No. Stop, I... I don't want you working yourself to the bone... not again. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) You think she would've wanted this? Don't tell me what she wanted. Happy Birthday. (SOFT MUSIC FADES UP) She'll be wearing that blue vintage dress I'll be trying my old fashioness I'm still wearing that same wedding suit (LOUD RUMBLING) (BRAKES SCREECHING) (OMINOUS MUSIC FADES UP) (DISTANT SIRENS WAILING) (GROANS) (MUSIC FADES UP) (MUSIC STOPS) He didn't come home last night. He's not answering his cell. Sheriff, please. There's something seriously wrong. He wouldn't... 24 hours? (BIRDS FLUTTERING) Ned? I'm looking for my dad. He hasn't come home. Neither has my wife. She took the Camaro. Drove the boy to Canada. She's afraid he'll get drafted. Have you seen David? Your dad's a good man. Guys like him, they run on hope. But... you can't eat hope. Hey. We haven't got the chance to tell you. Real sorry about your mom. She was a good one. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) Dad? (MUSIC FADES UP) (CAR ENGINE STARTS) (EKG BEEPING) David. Annabelle. I don't mean to be insensitive... but I was kind of hoping you could answer a question for me. Your mother underwent a kidney transplant at St. Luke's. Your father is listed as the donor. Her body rejected the transplant. See, what I'm trying to understand is... there must have been some kind of mistake. The x-rays... Your father has two perfectly functioning kidneys of his own. (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC CHANGES) (MUSIC FADES DOWN) COMMENTATOR (ON TV): We've just reached the point of no return. Ultimatum from Russia and China changes everything. Not hungry? COMMENTATOR (ON TV): And with no sign of the U.S. or Israel backing down. In the hospital, you kept calling her... talking to her like she was right there. COMMENTATOR (ON TV): Thermo-nuclear war and at the very least... a conflict that will just overshadow absolutely anything that's going on. I know it's been tough, but we're only going to make it if we work at this together. [ANNABELLE] Okay? Yeah. COMMENTATOR (ON TV): There's a great deal of secrecy surrounding... the General's next move. But there are rumors that ground forces are making their way... across the border into Tehran in the coming days. Air raids have already intensified... and we have word that special forces troops... have infiltrated several critical outposts closer in... paving the way for aggressive ground attacks. The first wave of US draft troops have arrived from training in Afghanistan... despite stern warnings from Russian, Chinese and French leaders. WOMAN (WHISPERING): David. David. Jane? I miss you. I know. What's happening to me? You remember the night I told you I was pregnant? You said you didn't want to bring a child into this place... but as long as we were together there was always hope. You have to create it. JANE (V.O.): There isn't much time... for Annie. COMMENTATOR (ON TV): The President has assured us that the disarmament of Iran... will insure a sense of security for generations to come... but what we're dealing with is the complete and utter... destabilization of an entire region. We've caused the displacement of thousands of families into refugee camps. These families are suffering from starvation due to overcrowding. The question we've got to ask ourselves is... when will the bloodshed come to an end? I wasn't expecting you to come all the way out here. I came so you could explain to me in person why, in the middle of a war... are you still chasing space rocks? I'm sure you can understand why we haven't been able to leave. The data is undeniable. You were ordered to shut down. I can't... not yet. We're too close. You were Army Intelligence before you joined us... four years in Pakistan, yet you chose an assignment completely unbefitting your skill set. I felt I could make a difference this time. This war needs men like you on the front line. Men with scars like yours, win wars. What we are about to find here, it could change everything. You wouldn't need war. The country is dying. People are starving. Desperate for opportunity... hope. War gives them a reason... purpose. Now, we don't need to end this war, not yet. But as is the case with any conflict, we do need a strategic advantage. Although the specimen we have hasn't survived... but there may be a living sample somewhere. It seems to require temperate climates. It's unsustainable above 80 degrees. What's the status of our patient? Dr. Wilkins advises that Mr. Gutierrez may not survive the procedure. We're at 23 casualties a day in Iran... 23. Open him up. I want to know everything about it. Hey. What are we telling the wife? You can tell her that Mr. Gutierrez suffered cardiac arrest... in the attempt to save him from a lethal virus. That his sacrifice has spared the country from a deadly epidemic. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (ENGINE STARTING) DAVID (ON TV): Oh, messy, messy face. Okay... silly me. Now push her on the swing. Look out. - Whoo! Daddy will catch you. - Touching the camera. There we go. I'm gonna tickle your feet. Okay. Want me to push you on the swing? Oh, you're a good girl... good girl. Hi, Daddy. [DAVID] Look at the camera. [JANE] I want a round. [ZACH] What are you doing? [O'MALLEY] Writing a letter to General Corazon. What for? The age of advanced technological warfare... and we're sending draftees to die in the desert. And here I am unemployed and impotent. Fuck draftees. I can still hold a gun. Yeah? I'd rather starve to death here. Beats the pity stares and those 11:00AM support groups. Nothing worse than being surrounded by a bunch of guys... claiming that the silver lining of the colostomy bag... is that you don't have to wait to the commercial to piss. You don't want to go back. See pain, I can deal with that. It's the inactivity that sucks. World's going to hell anyway. We're just reaping what we've sown. Hey, you know what Acrotomophilia is, right? Anima... what? It's perverts getting turned on by stumps. - No joke. - Why would you bring that up? You got one on your six. Give me a second. I get ten percent. What do you want? Still looking for a job? Run the winch. What are we haulin'? Bring it up! (HYDRAULICS WHIRRING) What the hell is that? Help me here. (HIGH-PITCHED TONE) Come on. Get in. COMMENTATOR (ON TV): What we're seeing now are the arrival... of half a dozen Chinese and Russian warships into the Persian Gulf... what the President is calling a futile show of intimidation... against the coalition forces currently occupying Iran. What's this? I'm putting half in the barn. The other half is going to Goodwill. Fresh start for both of us, right? This your mom's stuff? Yeah, well, you haven't been around much... so I figure that this place could use a little bit of a spring clean. This is one of her favorites. That ski-hike... we did in Vermont that winter... and the blizzard rolled in right over the top of us. You were so scared, but your mom held you so tight. You remember what she said? Nothing bad will ever last. You don't need to pretend she was never here to move on. (DOOR SLAMMING) (GROANS) You're due for an upgrade, man. Christ, Zach, this one works fine. - Ooh! - What's the matter? You all right? Yeah. Leg's playing up. Phantoms... I get 'em all the time. It's different if you see your limbs come off. You get closure. How much did that perv pay you? - $40. - That all? Well, it's something. One minute it's a job, next he's got his cock in your mouth. Makes sense to me. What else are we good for? They think you'll charge half the price for just one knee pad? Why don't you put that in your letter? Hm? What's that supposed to mean? Okay. You ready to do this? For all the good it's gonna do. We don't want your fascist war! We don't need your draft no more! We don't we want your fascist war! We don't we need your draft no more! (POLICE SIRENS WAILING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) All right, all right, come on, people. Let's wrap this up. We don't we want your fascist war! - We don't we need... - What the... Come on. Hey, sir? Hey, you look like a smart guy. Sign this and you won't have to worry about your kids getting blown up. How 'bout it? Traitor. - Say it again! Say it again! - Hey! Hey! Say it again! I'll kill you! Get off me! That's it, people! Enjoy the freak show! Huh? Want to spend a night in a jail cell? Oh, Jesus, you got to get that leg checked out, man. Go. Just go. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) What the hell is that? What the hell did you do to me? Dad? Get some water. Now, Annie! - Breathe, breathe. - (WATER FAUCET RUNNING) He needs to go to the hospital. No hospitals. Are you crazy? He'll bleed to death. No, he won't. It's healing him. What is that? I need you to stay here and watch him. Keep your eyes on him. I'll be back. (DOOR CLOSES) So what's the plan? Our movement orders came in. We report to Philly at 0800. I'm sorry to disappoint, gentlemen, but we're not going to Philadelphia. What? - Give me three samples. - Now what do you mean? We just had another one land... north-east. But our intel is thin at best. How do we explain this to Deputy Ep... Deputy Epstein will come around. I'm sure he'll be grateful for every dead soldier we don't need to bury. A blind man can see... what the fuck else do you need? We're going north-east. Medic! - Hey. - Are you okay? Stay calm. - Just rest. - You're okay? You're gonna start bleeding again. It'll be okay. Just rest. Okay? It's okay. It'll be okay. What the hell is going on here? We need to move him. Grab the door. Grab the door! Oh, hold him. What is that? It's dying from the heat. (GAS HISSING) We gotta get him closer. Bring that over. What's it doing? You'll see. Just watch. Hey... it's okay. Look. See? Hey. It's okay... he'll be here. (GASPS) (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING) (HAND SHAKING) Hey. You okay? It's real. I'm not dreaming. I hope not. What's it like? Strange. Where is he? (DOOR OPENS) Dad? You gotta see this. What's it for? Protection. Protection? From what? Something we can't prevent. Look, I know it sounds crazy, but you've seen what it can do. You've felt it. This... this is a gift. You have no idea what this thing is or what else it's capable of. You have to trust me with this, Annie. Everything'll be fine... I promise. We're gonna need a ton of steel. Ramon's got me on inventory. Shit job, but who's complaining, right? Guy's got his hands in so many pies, still bitches. Half the shit I don't even ask about. How you doing? You know. You should hook up with Mickey, trade some stocks. Yeah, that'd be great. That old metal works, though, that's where it's at. Swear to God if I had the money, I'd re-open it myself. Come on, that place's nothing but a graveyard. Hey, you could be my foreman. Thanks. So this is the shit you wanted? Yeah. I owe you. How's Annie holding up? She's worried. Who wouldn't be? No, I mean since Jane. I don't know. She's fine. Maybe better than I am. You know, I always wanted to kill you. Scoring the one girl on the drill team that turned me down. I was strong side linebacker. You always were a lucky son-of-a-bitch though, huh? Hey, thanks. Hey, how old are you now? Keep dreaming. Bottoms up. (RETCHING) - We should go to a titty bar. - Yeah. (DOOR OPENS) There you go. (SNORING) Yep. Got em. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Come on, let's go. This is it. You sure? Yeah. No one's set foot in here in years. Let's bring in that cement mixer. (KEYS JINGLING) Should I be concerned about any of this business? Oh, not at all, Sheriff. It's just protocol. Appears to be stable. Where's the rest of it? You're supposed to tell me. Do you believe in coincidences, Agent Stipe? In my experience, there are no coincidences, Sheriff. You might want to talk to David Chamberlain. Local guy, crashed his car near here the other night. Strangest thing, too. Not a scratch on him. It's unprecedented. At first we couldn't understand what we were seeing. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization identified the presence... of hundreds of different alleles for each gene. But this genetic information isn't organized into chromosomes as we understand them. So far, we've isolated multiple sequences resembling various plant and animal strands. Some of these strands even appear to be human. What we're dealing with here is a living sample of a biogenesis. Evolution? No, no. This precedes evolution. It's creation. Who'd have thought... that's an amoeba. I don't know what to do. You always said that he'd do things in his own way. The fact is that without you he... He did his best and... I hate him for it. I don't want to hate him. I never could quite understand how you... kept loving him. No matter how many times he let you down. I miss you so much, Mom. (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) This'll work. (MUSIC CHANGES) You're standing too close. What? Unless you're planning on setting yourself alight. You must be Annabelle. Special agent Julius Stipe... National Science Agency. We'd like to ask your father some questions. Is he here? No. Oh, no need to be alarmed. It's just protocol. (DEVICE BEEPING) What do you want with my father? We're looking for something. We're hoping he might be able to help us find it. (TRUCK APPROACHING) Got a little drunk with the boys. It was my birthday. I came home to celebrate with my daughter. I can't recall seeing anything but a light in the sky... and that was when I lost control. Not much more I remember before I blacked out. (SIGHS) You ever been to the Air and Space Museum in D.C., Mr. Chamberlain? No. My mother used to drive me there every summer. She'd let me wander the place for hours. I learned so many things about the universe and time and space. It's really incredible everything we've accomplished... but what's even more fascinating is how little we actually know. I've always believed that if we found real evidence... of something greater than ourselves... something that inspired the human race... then maybe the world would have peace. Now this thing you found, it just might be the miracle people are hoping for. Can't say I believe in miracles all that much. You have a kidney in your body that wasn't there before, Mr. Chamberlain. So, please don't lie to me. The last person to come in contact with an object like the one you found... he thought it had healed him, too. That's where I kept it. Wasn't long before I noticed it didn't react well to the humidity in here. Thing had just... melted. Melted? Things been tough, Mr. Chamberlain? Huh? Since the death of your wife. Must have been very hard for you... knowing there was nothing you could do to save her. Yeah. Sorry I can't be more help to you. No, you've been more than helpful. Thank you. Annie? They know you have it. They're gonna find it. What then? They take you away? Cut you open like that old man? No, that won't happen. Those men were here, in our house. It found me for a reason. She found me. Who? Who found you? Your mom, Annie. She showed me something's gonna happen. No. This... this thing is messing with your head, changing you. - Can't you see that? - No, you're wrong! She's gone, Dad. You didn't want to see it when she was lying in that hospital bed all alone... but she's gone and you can't bring her back. No! No. I won't let them take it away. You know what it showed me? It showed me everything I wanted to forget. Just before she died, she asked me where you were... when you were coming to see her. But you never came. (DOOR SLAMMING) Annie? (SCREAMING) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, Mickey, I need a favor. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) He's driving in circles. Bring him in. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) How you doing? Nice suit. [LUBINSKI] We have a situation. You lost him. For now. The daughter. REPORTER (ON TV): U.S. casualties have risen well above 35 soldiers a day... as the advancement into Tehran continues. Members of Congress have met to persuade the President and General Corazon... - to halt any further movement... - What the hell is that? - in Iran until an agreement can be reached... - This isn't gonna end well. ...with Russia and China. They'll shake hands, exchange pleasantries... then go back to killing children again. Ramon, you okay? Explain why some assholes are moving my scrap. - And a truck that only you have the keys to. - What? This some kind of inside job? Inside job? I don't know shit about this. No? It sure looks like your boy Chamberlain to me. Dave. Don't fuck with me, Cerillo. Get my truck back. (MOANING) Zach? You okay? Look at me. (MUFFLED GUNFIRE) Didn't know where else to go. She was sick. He did everything he could. Gave her a part of himself... but she kept getting worse. All he did was work. Trying to pay for treatments we couldn't afford. I know he thinks he's doing this for me... but I can't be the reason. They'll kill for it. I won't let that happen. Okay? I'll take you to your dad... but first... I want you to meet someone. Jim. I brought a friend. This is Annabelle. You know the T-bones they're serving here are shipped in from China? You believe that? Where the hell is all our meat, if we gotta eat cows from China? Hey. I've found a way to make things better. The way it was before. I don't need another one of your goddamned arms or legs, Zach. I got nowhere to go. Hey, listen. Listen to me. Hey! It's healed. It's healed. That's a nice trick. Come with me. I can make you better. Maybe another time. Celtics are playing the Bulls tonight. Not many games left. Who knows if there'll even be another season, right? I'm coming back and I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay? (CAR APPROACHING) Let's go for a ride, Corporal. Don't be a hero. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Tony? We used to play in here. You stole Ramon's truck. For this? What the fuck is this? - You couldn't begin to understand. - Understand? After all I've done for you? This is the only way. This thing is bigger than you. Bullshit! I got responsibilities. - Dave, I'm not going down for you. - You won't go down. - I'm not going down for you or no one. - I'm telling you. Yeah, police. Shit! Tony? (DRIPPING) [JANE] Dave? (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) How long since we last did this? Thanksgiving... two years ago. That was the last time I could move like this. You're so beautiful. Where is she, David? - She doesn't trust me. - She wants to. No. No, I've done a terrible thing. I don't deserve this. I know. It was never meant for you. You have to find them. You're out of time. REPORTER (ON TV): This has now been confirmed. Bagram Airbase, the U.S. military's primary staging point for Operation Terminus... has been attacked by a long range WMD of Russian origin. We have unconfirmed reports this was in fact a nuclear missile. The search for survivors has been impeded by the danger and instability of the site. Says here you were wounded in combat. Left leg amputated below the knee. REPORTER (ON TV): In the Pentagon report that we are now at DEFCON 1... meaning the nuclear retaliation against Russia... Well, by the looks of it, things have taken quite a turn for you. Think of the good we could achieve, Corporal. Field casualties would drop exponentially. We could actually have a chance at ending this war. Don't you see that? You need to tell me where it is, Annabelle. Wherever he's taken it, you can be sure it's far from here. Touching. Stop! Tell me where it is! I gave you a chance... on your knees. We got something by the barn. He's here. Get him. Move around back. Go. (GUN COCKS) Mr. Chamberlain. We have to go, Annie. We're not leaving him here. The key. Turn around. Slowly! What now? (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) - Can you walk? - Yeah. Come on, Annie. We've got to get out of here. Come on. Get the rifle. Give me the gun. (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) Annie! Come on, let's go! (ENGINE STARTING) (ANNIE GROANING) Stay... stay with me. Stay, stay. It's okay. It's okay, Annie. Okay, Dad. It's okay. Come on! All right... they're headed across town. This isn't right. We're on the brink of nuclear war. I need you to understand that. Maybe this thing wasn't sent to win wars. Just drive. You hear me? Just fucking drive. She needs you. She's waiting for you. Baby, I did this for you. (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) Come on. Please, please. Please! Fuck! They're here. Sorry, baby. She's gone. David, what are you doing? Put it down. You're gonna get us killed. David, stop. You don't want to do anything stupid. I need you to put that out. No. I have to destroy it. Put it out now. Dad? - Dad! - Wait! Stop! Crap! I won't let you do this. You stupid fuck. (LOUD RUMBLING) (SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING) (RUMBLING CONTINUES) Dad. Come on, Dad. Stay inside. Annie! I need you to look after her for me. Can you do that? Get inside, Zach. Get inside! Dad. I'm sorry, Annie. I'm sorry. I can't go. Go where, Dad? I love you. Dad! Dad! Annie, it's okay... it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. (LOUD RUMBLING) What is that? David, look at me. Open it. I can't... I can't open it. (TRICKLING) Annie. It's okay. [JANE] Come home, David. Come home. (MUSIC CONTINUES) (CRACKLING) (BOMB WHISTLES) (EXPLOSIONS BOOMING) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC FADES UP) (FLIES BUZZING) ANNABELLE (V.O.): My mother once told me... nothing bad will ever last. (MUSIC CHANGES) (MUSIC CHANGES) She'll be wearing that blue vintage dress I'm be trying my old-fashioned vest I'm still wearing my same wedding suit She's still waiting for the one that she knew When she comes a flowin' in her blue favorite dress The one with the bells that ding And the hem that needs a mend In my mind it has hands of its own And my hands seem to have grown a mind of their own It seems so long ago since I felt her skin Life gets so busy now we never get to begin But I hear those bells a dingin' Coming through the gate I'm here designing now amorous embrace And my eyes have grown hands of their own And my hands seem to have grown eyes of their own (MUSIC ENDS)
