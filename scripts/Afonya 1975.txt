Did you check his papers? Mister! I want to see your passport. Borschov, I've been waiting for you for 3 hours. You've been hanging around hell knows where. Scam! What now... Kolya's gone... God! Alcoholic. What's wrong with downing a shot on pay day! Pay day my ass! I bought you perfume. 'Moscow'. Not there. I clearly remember buying it. You drank it up. With Kolya. You've ruined my life, Borschov! - Here we go again... - Yes... Yes... 'Here we go again'. I've wasted 2 years of my life on you. Thought we'd get married and live like all normal people do. I... Hiccup, hiccup, for Fedot you stick up, then jump on to Jacob, then on to Mike, then to anyone you like. You are a bastard, Borschov. Bastard. Get back here! I said, get back here! She thought..! - What's the next stop? - 'Profsoyuznaya'. Belikov. Feel my forehead. Am I running a fever? It's room temperature. Murad, you feel it. You need to cut down on your drinking.

We've a group of technical school apprentices here! Come in, feel yourselves at home. But don't forget you're visiting. Oh, it's only Borschov. The rest are nice people basically. I'll allocate you to your sections, and our mechanics will show what you theoretically know. Not a bad rhyme. Avdeyev and Buryak. Your tutor will be Belikov. He'll teach you to lose wrenches. God! Rakhimov takes Kim, Krivonos and Bubnov. Uncle Pasha Shevchenko takes Vasilyev, Ivanov and Sedin. Hello. - Well, good luck! - The hell with it! Well, get to know each other better. Where're my guys? Guys. Not so fast! Don't get to know each other better! Lyudmila Ivanovna, and what about me? - What about you? - Any students for me? No students left. They ran out. What'd you mean, ran out? There's 8 of them. Makes 2 for each of us. - That's not what I think. - Why? Because. Sure, if a person went wrong once, - he's in for a life-long thrashing. You work your guts out - and you don't get no students. Lyudmila Ivanovna... I've been Lyudmila Ivanovna for 40 years now. So? All right. No students it shall be. - But what matters is the truth. - What truth? Look at yourself in the mirror! give you more than 26! You two beer fans? When it gets hot. Heat or no heat - don't even think about it at work! My apprentice students. Boy, it's hot! Borschov! You still here?! There's been an accident. They called 3 times! Albert Petrovich! How's it going? Can't blame it. They've forced these students on me here. Have to teach'em. Stop! This way. What's this here? - A tap. - I can see that. What kind? - It's to water. - Good. It's a watering tap! And what comes out of this tap? - Water. - Sure as hell it's not beer. A spurt of water as thin as a match ends up in a leakage of Comrade mechanic! - Over here! The 9th floor! - On my way! Wait a second, Afanasy Nikolayevich. I'll wind the tap closed. Wait! This is Belikov's sector. He's got his own students. Cm'on! Semyon! Start the elevator! Need to get to the 9th floor! Can't do that. Come back after lunch. Outrageous! He's been fixing it for 3 days. Right, we'll come back after lunch. Afanasy Nikolayevich, water's flooding the apartment up there. - Wrench! - I only twisted it slightly, and... 'Twisted it'! Wrench! Hurry up! Give him the wrench! All I needed is this pain in the ass. Where do you work anyways, Archimedes? In the planetarium. What if I'd tried to twist one of your microscopes? - A catastrophe. - See what I mean? Cm'on, wiseguys. Well, grandpa, I turned off your water main. And don't you attempt to open the main tap. When'll you open it? Hell knows. There're no 'o' rings at the warehouse. - What am I supposed to do? - Think! You're an astronomer, aren't you? - Maybe you could get one someplace? - Where would I get it? - I'm no Magic Gold Fish. - I'll be much obliged. Get me my magic case, Vova. Think I had something like that in store. Just one. My own personal one. Cost me 2.80. It's made in Japan. There. - Sly dog! - Who, me? We'd rather like milk soup and potato cutlets. You talk too much. Well hey there! - You work here now? - 81 kopecks. These are on me. Them my students. Hello. It'll be 2 rubles 43 kopecks. Why aren't you a foreman yet? They won't make you? Who, me? They offered me a thousand times. But what do I need it for? Your ambitions are completely atrophied. - Wha..? - You've no urge to become famous. How can a foreman be famous? He's no cosmonaut or hockey player. A foreman has heaps of work and a fixed salary. Whereas I'm paid piece rate. - Plus overwork. - Plus tips. Archimedes! He can use his brains alright. Here's for the movie tickets. Thanks. No thanks. And I'll give you back - You so rich, eh? - Can't say we're poor. You think I'm poor? - I let them go. - What'd you mean, you let them go? They learned fast. Clever guys. Borschov, wait! - Do you realize you... - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - You never get tired of joking. - Who's joking? Why do you hang around here? I let you go, so off you go. We ask to be transferred to another specialist. We refuse to work with Borschov. - Why? - It's a matter of principle. Principle my ass! It is I who refuse to work with you! What do I need you for? Same salary, and an extra pain in my ass. Afanasy! Hey there! - Can I stay with you? - What? It's only for a while. She threw me out. Be my guest. Gave me one bed set. Said I could come for the second one after she picks it from the laundry. I rented this folding bed. Afanasy! Do you have macaroni? - Macaroni. - No. I bought 3 packs. Highest quality. - Step inside. - Afanasy, do you snore? I don't know. Well I do! But it's no big deal. You go ahead and punch me on the side. Gotcha. So I moved in. - Don't we have a TV-set? - Nope. Why don't we rent one? They're cheap. Go ahead and do that. - Where'd I put it? - What're you looking for? - My necktie. - I'll give you mine. Claudia brought it from Sochi. It's nice looking. Where is... There it is! Lay there calm and quiet. Mount Ahun. Against the setting Sun. Here, Afanasy, wear it. No, thanks. Afanasy. Don't worry, I won't be staying long. Soon as Mikhalych comes back from vacation, I'll move to his place. You from the telephone station? - No. - You're Vasya from the 3rd construction company! - Right? - No. I'm Kolya, a plasterer. You're the guy from Assol cafe last night? - That's me. - I thought I saw you before. - Why didn't you say so? Hello! - Hello. So it's a housewarming then? Draw! One of us will have to go get the booze. - Oh, no! - Why not? I've got... allergy. What?! Allergy. There, this one? That's the one. All right then. You make yourself at home, and I'm off to a meeting. Oh, it's you? Hey. I was passing by and I thought I'd drop by. Well, you go on and head your way. How can I help you? Sorry, wrong address. CLEANING DAY Trofimych! - Where's Fedul? - On lunch break. Don't you ever have lunch? You're like some camel. Camel yourself. I need to talk to Sima Petrovna. Where is she? Leopold here. Got married? Long ago? May I? The lady's engaged, dude. - What is your name? - Claire. - I'm Carl. - Dude! On this one it's dames that ask men to dance. What about yourself? Are you a dame? And that is strictly my personal business. You're no dame, you're an asshole. What? It's wonderful weather, don't you think? All right, we'll talk later. Cockroach's tit! Young lady! Do they have a cafeteria here? I don't know. May I ask you for a dance? - Me? - Yes. You may. Looks like they don't have a cafeteria. I don't know. I'm here for the first time. I've arranged to come here with my girlfriend, Pasha Stroganova, paramedic from ward 3. But she couldn't make it. Good heavens! There's our TU committee chairman! Now I will have to dance with him all night! Sorry, pal. - May I? - Already taken, dude. Ladies ask men. One minute. Soon I'll be old and grey-haired, - Time to retire and write memoirs... This is a hot dance. That's him. We can relax, have some tea, listen to the radio. The program for those who do not sleep. - What's your name? - Lyudmila. Well, I happen to be Ruslan. Holy baloney! I forgot to call our HR manager. I won't take a minute. Ruslanych! I've a plasterer staying at my place. Tell him to grab his pillow and mattress and go into the bathroom. Thanks. Excuse me. Hey, mister, can I have you for a chat? Working hours over. - Chicken, eh? - Who, me? - Scared of you? - Cm'on then? Cm'on. So who's an 'asshole'? They let you out? Hazel-eyes! What re you doing here? - I thought... - You thought what? - I was worried. - Worried? Are you a street cleaner? - Why? - Why'd you have to call the police? Now they'll report me to my boss. All right, bye now. I'm really sorry! - Where'd you live? - Old city. Old city. How will you get home? Buses don't run at this time of night. Boiled water. Spoon. Tea. Sugar? Sugar. Drink it, or you'll catch pneumonia. What's your name, hazel-eyes? Katya. I'm Dormidont. - Yevlampiyevich. - No you're not. You're Afanasy. The country knows its heroes by name! How do you know me? You played volleyball with my brother. Snegirev. Remember him? - The dark haired lad? - No, he's got brown hair. He was in the reserve team. Don't know anyone from the reserve. He moved to Irkutsk. Got married. Has 3 kids. Good for him. Blimey! It's past 2.00. Gotta go grab some sleep. You can sleep in the room, and I'll stay here. - I'll bring the folding bed. - Oh no, I'll go home. The rain's over. Almost. - I'd see you home, but... - Oh no, no need to. As you like. Chao. I'll give you a ring. Sometime. - What? What time is it? - Wakey, wakey, company! Sit. Eat. Did you hit the door jamb or something? No. It was an airplane. What airplane? TU-134. It was landing, I got a bit absent there, and - bang! My Volodya used to have a haircut exactly like yours. He comes back - I'll have to keep an eye on him. - So you have kids? - Two. Volodya and Lena, my girl. We need to buy a third fork. - Go ahead. - You have to get married, Afanasy. What ever for? So I get thrown out of my house like you? Don't generalize. Mine is an individual separate case. A family is a cell that forms a society, It is the foundation of a state. Hello! Hey there, hazel-eyes! How're you doing? - I'm fine. - That's my girl! Keep it up! Wait! What're you doing here? Afanasy. I work as an ambulance nurse. Where I work - they were distributing circus tickets. They have Himalayan bears riding bicycles. I took 2 tickets. Want to come? - When? - Tonight. Tonight I can't. Have to get ready for the world politics class. I'm conducting the politics class tomorrow. What's your number? No. Ours is a different number. I'll remember. 50 - that's one shot of Vodka, one more shot, and 2. - Still I'll write it down for you. - Whatever. Such is life, Katyusha. It's all work, social extra-work activities, self-education. And no personal life. Soon as I'm free - I'll give you a call. Comrades! We received another signal from the militia. And once again it's about Borschov. With your permission I'll read it to you. - Go ahead, shoot. - Afonya! Come out to the stage. - Let the good folks see you. - Coming! On April 2 this year, while on vacation at the 'Gorny Orel' resort home, employee of your organization Borschov, being in a drunken state, was arrested by the local militia for jumping and bathing in the fountain in the city square. We advise you to discuss Borschov's unworthy conduct and administer a public reprimand. Chief of local militia dept of the city of Ja... Jarobaidy. Captain Tshardzh... Tshardzhbridzhi Badzhibayev. Well, comrades. Any questions to Borschov? Show some initiative, comrades! Why'd you jump into the fountain? Was it so hot? - It was because of a woman. - She was drowning? No. There was a bunch of us. And she said: 'Bet Voldemar won't jump into the fountain!' - So I jumped. - Why you? Why is it always you? That Voldemar fellow should've jumped. That's what she called me. Oh, so I see. Still it's not good, Borschov. We gave you a discount on your voucher, - and you! - That's not good. - Can't agree more. Well, comrades. Borschov recognizes the fact of his disorderly conduct. Any suggestions? Fyodorov! I suggest we issue a warning notice, and all go home. Good idea. Today they're showing the 6th episode. I've already got a 'warning notice'. I don't have the 'severe reprimand'. Oh, keep quiet, I know that. Comrades. Borschov already has a 'warning notice'. He hasn't got a 'severe reprimand'. Any suggestions? - Who is it? - The Pope in person! - Who? - It's the plumber! Open up. Hello. Our tap roars like a tiger. You don't have to do that. I'll mess up your floor. Done. It doesn't roar any more. - You can use it safely. - Thank you. No problem. If you need me, just call. I'm A. N. Borschov. A. N. Borschov! You intend to go barefoot? That's what overwork does to you. My boy's got 3 conditions. Will have to feed the little sponger all summer. Life's no easy thing. What time is it? Young lady, what time is it please? - 20 past 17.00. - 20 past 17.00. - So where is he? - He promised to be here at 17.00. One moment. Wanna be the third party? - What? - Wanna be third? - What? - Oh, go home! Afonya! I don't like people like him! Unpunctual. Shit! Afanacy, do you happen to know the UN decision on Honduras? You and... who N? I've a feeling I live in a cave. - Borschov! - I'm not in. I'm away on field works. Complete isolation. Afonya! Hey, friend, call Afonya for us, will ya! He's not in. Where is he? - He went away. - Went away? He's on fieldworks. - I don't fancy the likes of him. - And who's that? - And who're you? - Me? A relative... Distant. Spare us a ruble, relative. Afonya owes me a ruble. - 2. - Two! A. N. Borschov? - May I come in? - Please do. Done. You can use it now. How much do I owe you? Nothing. The lack of client complaints - is the best reward for a job well done. All the best. Eventually we can replace the sink too. Borschov! What do you say? What is it? Need to cut! - What about a pipe strap? - No good. Call the emergency brigade! They are fixing a sewer accident in block 17. You know that. That's none of my concern. I finished my shift. You're the forewoman - you figure it out. Good man, what about us? We can't eat, can't drink, can't wash our laundry. water. Is this not water? Good enough for drinking and washing. You can use it as a swimming pool, grandpa! Am I right? And I'm done for today. See you tomorrow. Chao! - What's your apartment, grandpa? - 27. So I've replaced the sink in this one too. - Sign here. It won't leak now. - It didn't before. It would have. It was tin-plate. I've changed it for a cast iron - to last for ages. Well thank you, but... You can't spread 'thank you' over your bread. Chao. Done. You can use it now. I don't know how to thank you enough. That's nothing. - You know who you are? - Who? You're Gena the Crocodile. As handsome as him? No. As generous. With time I could install a Finnish basin in your bathroom. - Ivan! What are you doing? - See for yourself. Picking mushrooms. I see. 'And I play my harmonica for passersby to see...' - Hey there, hazel-eyes! - Hello. - How's life? - Fine. That's my girl. Keep it up! So what's new? Ivan! That's no way to do it! It's leaning. You should use a plumbrule. Why don't you come over here and help. Consultant. I can't. I've no time. So how's life? Tell me. Afanasy. Where I work paramedic Fedoseeva had just had twins. - No kidding! - Yes. A boy and a girl. The girls and I went to buy her a baby pram. When we came back, they said someone called me. - I thought, maybe it was you. - Me? No, I didn't call. I went away on fieldworks. Only just come back. - I thought it might have been you. - No... Just look at them! Can't do anything right. Funny. They're doing it for themselves! And I thought it was you. Give me your hand. Clench your fist. Say: beep! Louder. Hello! It's Gena the Crocodile speaking. There, so I called you. I don't seem to be feeling well. I'd better go lie down. Read some papers. Maybe you need medicine? No. I prefer Homemade remedies to medicine. Soon as I get better, I'll call you. At the vocational school I used to sing in a choir. They were going to send me to a music school. I had a 1st degree in volleyball too. They recommended me for a master's degree. I could be a couch by now. Would travel worldwide. If I hadn't quit, that is. What's the use... Claudia travelled to Hungary. I've been asking her - she saw nothing. Went on a shopping spree, bought a wig. That made her happy. - For you? - For herself. Afanasy, are your parents alive? No. My mother died when I was one, father was killed in the war. You grew up in an orphanage? No. My aunt looked after me. - She alive? - Auntie Frosya? She's alive all right. That's her. - And that's you? - Right. You're funny. She used to call me Magic Horse. A good-looking woman. Half our village was crazy about her. Only she was a one man woman. Her fianc was killed in the Finnish war - and that was it for her. She must have grown older by now. Haven't seen her since I went to serve in the army. Remind me to send her a postcard, will you? I moved here, and I didn't send her my new address. Look! There's a comet. It's only an airplane. Afanasy! If they'd offered you a planet with any kind of life you choose, - what would you choose? I'd like one with free beer. I'd choose one just like ours. Only without wars, hotbeds of tension.... So that people would live in peace and accord, and not abuse each other for trifling causes. Give you an example. There's this guy Vasya Solovyev - our tasksetter. Him and I spent 2 hours standing in line to buy fresh bloodworm. We finally got it, prepared it, - and she threw it out into the sewer. Who, Solovyev? The bloodworm. Broke our fishing rods too. No. I tell you, we haven't achieved all-round sociability. Tired, Afonya? Yes. - Hello, children. - Hello, father. Do you do your homework? They do. You have to study. You can't get nowhere without education today. There you go. - Borschov! Drop by the office. - What? Vladimir Nikolayevich wants to see you. What for? There's been a report from the militia. You're charged with organizing a fight in a dance hall. When do you have the time for all this, Borschov? Jumping into fountains, fighting in dance halls? Comrades, does anyone have questions to Borschov? Show some initiative, comrades. We're wasting our own time. - Your turn to make a speech. - Comrades! On what topic? - Pipes. - Comrades! For 3 months 1-inch pipes have been lying useless in the yard, and Voronkov doesn't give a damn. And it's winter soon. Get your sleigh ready in the summer... - Where would I get the workers? - Voronkov! Don't sidetrack the meeting! What do you suggest on the Borschov case? Now about Borschov. What about Borschov? I think he deserves an honorable mention. - Afonya? Whatever for? - For a noble attitude to women. Vladimir Ivanovich, let's not keep the meeting waiting! Borschov? Maybe an honorable mention? A mention? What for? Comrades! This way we won't be through until next morning. It's such a trifling issue, and we are wasting so much time. Go ahead, Vostryakova. And no more jokes. I'm not in the mood. What is happening with us? Our comrade is going downhill, and we are laughing. Goes downhill? He goes dancing! - You see what I mean. - Quiet! Quiet, comrades! Go on, Lyudmila Ivanovna. - Go on! - What? - Suggest a community sanction. - What for? We have to respond to the signal. That's the thing. No one really cares what happens to Borschov. We all want to run home to watch TV. Meanwhile, before our very eyes, a working man is turning into a hooligan and a drunkard. - He's a disgrace to look at. - Don't look. I can't avoid it. Yesterday he left the scene of an accident. without water. He left ruthlessly. I didn't sign up for working overtime. All you can think of - is get a tip from the tenant and get stoned. You're a Neanderthal man! - A who? - A Neanderthal! I'm Fantomas. Borschov! Can you prove by facts that Borschov accepted cash from tenants? What other facts do you need? Look at him scoffing at us! Satisfied, as fat as butter, the world-beater! I don't need to sit on a diet. I'm not eager to get married. At 42. What? Really now... What shall we do with you, Borschov? I suggest we give Borschov the sack. For what? For everything. Because of your likes normal people can't live in peace. My sister's husband Fedul, your pal, squandered away all his dough on booze. He beats up his wife, his son. Yet you still want to make a man out of him. I suggest that we fire Borshov. Which way is better: like this, or like this? Don't crumple it. Claudia brought it from Riga for me. Hey there! Nice weather, ein't it? Why're you so jolly today? No special reason. I've been promoted to a management position. I'm away on fieldworks. Hello. - Is the tenant home? - He went away on fieldworks. - Long ago? - That's right. I saw him in the window just now. Oh really? That's strange. Perhaps he slipped past me unnoticed. Come in. Oh, you've come back then! I've been in the kitchen. Must've missed you. Afanasy, when did you come back? - Yesterday. - Really? Excuse me. Well, Borschov, so you've decided to keep your head down? Why? I simply decided to take a break. - Don't I have the right? - Of course you do. - Made in Leningrad? - Saratov. Look at that. They've finally mastered the tricks of the trade. - Taking a break, eh? - That's right, sir. My woman sais: Go up to Afonya, talk to him. After today's meeting he's bound to go on drinking bout. So you've come to lecture me? Why lecture? Thought I'd drop by for no reason. Don't you have a TV set? Nope. No radio either. And I don't subscribe to newspapers. - That's my boy, a hero. - No, you are the heroes. Demoted a 4th degree mechanic to an odd-jobber, and are happy now. Nobody's happy. You've got to understand: the people want to help you. Help me? Why does everyone want to help me? I don't barge into people's lives, I let everyone live. I won't care if they walk on their heads. - They do just that. - So what do I care? Care for some macaroni with cheese? No, thank you, I've already had dinner. - How about some tea? - That I might. Thank you. You know what's your worst quality, Borschov? You are indifferent. What's so bad about that? I'm indifferent. Kolya here is henpecked. You are beetle-browed. We are all different. So what? I read in a book, that you shouldn't as much fear traitors and murderers, - because all they can do is betray or kill, - as those indifferent. It's with their silent connivance that all crimes are committed. Same old story. What do all of you want from me? Am I any worse than all the rest? Don't others take tips or drink? Do all of them have wings? Why don't you leave the others alone? Think about yourself. Look at yourself! Comrade, you are wrong there. Every individual first of all has to think about the society, and only then - about himself and his place in it. Your philosophy will lead us nowhere. This is what I say, Borschov. In building 4 you had replaced a Finnish sink with a rusty old one. If by tomorrow you won't put it back in place,- you will be fired. All philosophy aside. A. N. Borschov? Hello. Hello. You are a magician, A. N. Borschov. - Ellen, what floor? - 7. Lena, do you have the keys? Yes. Ivan, I want you to meet A. N. Borschov in person. Oh, Gena the Crocodile! Nice to meet you. Orlov. - Borschov. - Look at the sink he brought us. Wonderful. How much do we owe you? A.N. Borschov works for free. He's an altruist. Altruists can do with money too. They have wives too. That enough? - Do we go or don't we, bros? - We sure do. There's some more. And we'll install it tomorrow, right? I'll be working at home. Thank you. Good bye. Why isn't brother Borschov joining us? A. N. Borschov, come on in. He's got work to do. Good bye, Gena the Crocodile. Oh my darling, oh my darling, You stop leaning on your dove! Oh my dove, oh my dove, I'm so terribly in love! There you go, my friend. One more time, mother! Up! Cut the yelling, cut the scolding, I won't hide and I won't run, I am young, my heart is yearning, I just wanna have some fun! Katyusha, there's someone asking for you. - Oh! - Hello. You receive guests? - What kind of jam do you prefer? - Any kind. There's blueberry jam. I made it myself. Want some? I do. We've honey too. Mother brought some from Kuban. You like honey? - Where is your mother now? - She's on her shift. She works as a train conductor. Don't you worry, Afanasy. Everything's going to be just fine! What's important is that you're a good man, and all mistakes can be corrected. You should come to your senses. If I'd known you would come - I'd make a mushroom pie. Katerina. Would you marry me? Would you? For that you have to love me, don't you? Afanasy. If you like, on Saturday we could go sailing. Where I work this paramedic, Shagar, has a 2nd degree in yachting sport. I'll ask him, and he'll take us for a ride. Would you like that? Next summer we can sail along the Yenisei river. Go camping. I saw it on TV - beautiful nature, rapids. We might as well. Afanasy. You have a wrinkle, right on your nose bridge. It's like a little ray. One over here too. We're getting old. No. It's because you like to laugh. When someone's funny and jolly, they have wrinkles around the eyes. Jolly. I sure feel like jumping with joy. Afanasy, I was thinking. Where I work there's this girl, Sonya Ryabinkina, she was also judged by the collective. But it was her own fault. She was rude with doctors. She never wore her cap when on shifts. Never took part in social extra-work activities. But then she came to her senses. Now you wouldn't recognize her. She's always polite. Wears her white cap at all times. She even started writing poems for the wall newspaper. About influenza, encephalitic... Main thing is to come to one's senses. Right? It's five o'clock. I have to be going, Katyusha. Have to meet my aunt. My aunt is coming to visit from the village. Afanasy, would you like me to come with you? No, Katyusha. It's cold outside. Katyusha, was I very drunk last night? You see, we kinda celebrated Yevdokimov's retirement... Afanasy. They're sending me to Afrika. They've built a new hospital there With up-to-date equipment. Anna Ivanovna, Ryabinkina and me. Now I don't know whether I should go or not. Katya. What shift are you working today? - The second shift. - I'll give you a call, right? Deal, hazel-eyes? Afonya! Afonya, bosom buddy! - Afonya! - He's not in. - Afonya! - I'm telling you, he's not in. And who are you? Go get some sleep. You're drunk! Why won't you stay for some more? We'll buy us a TV set. I can't. Afanasy, I told you I can't. My son's coming back from the army. What example will I show him? So I'll apologize. No big deal. There's no harm in it for me. There, let's sit for the road. Maybe I should get married? I don't know. I really don't know, Afanasy. A man has to decide his own life. - Wait, let's talk some more. - I can't. Have to go. I still need to drop my things at home on my way to work. You forgot your hat. No problem. It's my contribution. Afanasy, I wrote down my address for you. Drop by my place sometime. - Promise! - I will. Best when Claudia is not at home. She saw your portrait and... Well, you know. Thank you, Afanasy. Thank you for everything. Good bye. Good luck! Hello, aunt Frosya. Hello, Magic Horse! I'm making you a shirt to wear on September 1. For that you've ruined your only dress! It's no use anyway. Relative! Relative! Gimme a ruble, relative! Afonya owes me a ruble. Katyusha, we're here. What's wrong with you? - Lena, did they discharge Fedoseeva? - Not yet. Katyusha! - Someone called you. - Who? A man. Hey there, rabbits! He's not in, young lady. He left. - Where to? - To a village. - Oh, on fieldworks? - He left for good. How? Hello. Hello. Hello! Hello there. Afonya! Afonya! Let's go home! - I'm talking to you! - Be right there. I've been hearing it since this morning. Hurry up! Coming. What, you fancy my steel stallion? Want to swap? I give you my horse, you give me your cap. Fidget? Boar? Wait... Wait, wait. Turn your side to me. In the darkest forest, in the darkest forest... Magic Horse! - Magic Horse! - Fidget. Ask to be dismissed of my own free will - coma - papers to be sent to Borschov - coma - I give up my apartment. A. N. Borschov. Thank you, Nadyusha. You plan to work here? - Maybe. - Not maybe. For sure! You know who this is? Professor of plumbing engineering! By the way, he's single. Give us a smile, Lescheva. You know what teeth she's got? She can bite a nail in half! Yelizaveta! Magic Horse is back! My bosom buddy. - Hello. - Hello! - Don't be late! - Don't worry! He doesn't drink. - He's got allergy! - What? Allergy! We'll go fishing. I bought a bike. Only it's hush-hush for Yelizaveta. While she's in Fedot's henhouse. - I will plow... - I will plow... - I will till the land! - I will till the land! - Ivan Ivanov! Remember him? - You bet. Every morning Ivan Ivanov takes his stupid pants off! Every night the same old man puts his pants back on again. Wait till I get you! Cockroach's tit! To think how many years I've sent down the drain in the city! - Now we'll start from scratch! - You bet! - In the darkest forest! - In the darkest forest! When? It's been over a year now. I thought you knew. We sent you a telegram. Didn't you receive it? I don't understand. I'll go get the key. Hope I'm not interfering. Who're you? I'm Egor Leschev. You don't remember me? Uncle Egor. Come in, uncle Egor. Sit down. Oh, no. I've just dropped by for a sec. That's how it is, uncle Egor. So I've come back. Well, come into possession of the inheritance. This is Frosya's archive. I kept it just in case. Papers for the house. Account book. She saved 87 rubles in your name. Bonds. Letters written by Kolya, your father. Thank you. His death notice. Your letters. Read'em, they're good letters. Frosya wrote them to herself. - How? - Very simple. She would write a letter, slip it into a mailbox in Leshevka village, then receive it at this end, and read it to us. Everyone knew, of course, but didn't show it. She loved you. She sure did. She passed away right here, by the window. Never got tired of waiting for you. The number! - The number? - Give me the phone number. - Hospital. - What hospital? I need the phone number. A shot of Vodka - that's 50, 5-0, and then... Nadyusha, the client forgot the number. Forgetful fellow. Will you give it a try through the register-office? A personal favor. Thank you, Nadyusha. The address! Quick! - Mine? - Of your fianc. It's near a monastery. A 2-storey house. Do you at least know her name? - I do. - Well? Snegireva Yekaterina. Nadyusha, sweetie! Try to find her for me. City hospital. First 4 digits are: 50-50. Name Snegireva Yekaterina. I'm waiting. - Will she find her? - She will. Hello. Yes. - She's out. - Where is she? Where is she, if you please? I see. Thank you. She left. Once a daring maple In a maple grove With a stunning birch Fell hopelessly in love... Attention! Departure of flight number 302 Verhnye Yamki - Petrozavodsk is delayed due to... Touch me and caress me With your tender branch. Now I stand here dying For your loving touch. Answer me, my darling, I love you so much. But the dashing whirlwind Heard the song of love, He sent thunder coming On the maple grove. And the feeble maple Lost the fearful fight, Just his farewell love song Lingers in the night. I want to change my ticket. Again? How I dream to build a castle, A splendid crystal castle, For my very lovely princess, I'd become the good magician that would work for you. Cause it's only in a fairytale, Yes it's only in a fairytale, That thing happen Like you want them to. It is only in a fairytale That all your dreams come true. May I see your passport, young man? Ticket please? You were going to fly to Murmansk, then to Petrozavodsk. Now - Cherepovets? - So is it all the same to you? - Looks like it. Who are we running away from? From myself. You can run away from yourself, but not from the militia. Follow me, mister. Transit flight Zavyalovsk - Cherepovets has just landed. Passengers are requested to board. Mister! Follow me. What's the problem anyway? This is not your passport, young man. Whose is it? Look here. Now here. Well? Do you find any resemblance? How about - like this? My apologies. Afanasy! Someone called. I thought it might have been you. Script - Alexander Borodyansky Directed by Georgy Danelia Camera - Sergei Vronsky Production designer - Boris Nemechek Music - M.
