I told him not to bother waiting for you. - Did he say anything? - Yes..."Off to the dancehall again?" - Are you coming along? - I can't go every day. Why not? Let's go. Sorry to keep you waiting. Please come again. Good day. On your way home? Father-in-law! Welcome back. - What are you looking at? - At that sunflower. Fabulous, isn't it? Bigger than a man's head, even. I don't know if it's my brains getting muddled recently... ...but whenever I see a sunflower, I think of a man's head! I wonder if the inside of a man's head could be as beautiful as a flower. Wouldn't it be great if you could send your brains off to be cleansed? That's what I was thinking about on the train home! You could remove your head... ...take it down the hospital and say, "Wash this for me," like at the laundry! You're too funny! The best part would be, as the hospital got on with cleansing the brain... ...you could just sleep for a week while you waited! Oh, Father! The body could just rest, without getting up, without dreaming. Father, you must be feeling tired. Perhaps you haven't fully convalesced yet. But that was a year ago. Why don't you go for a check-up and another X-ray? If you say so! Here you are. - What is it? - Green snails. Kikuko, would you get me some sweetened water? "If you say so"! - Did you buy these? - Yes. Really? We almost bought the same things. Lobsters, shrimps... and my green snails. All from Enoshima's stall. We've gone a bit over the top! What a feast we have tonight! Kikuko, wasn't there another green snail? Oh! Grandad and Grandma, you'd find it hard on your teeth... ...so I thought you could share one. What? And what's with the "Grandad"? There are no grandchildren around. Forgive me! It's fine. Kikuko's right, we'll do with one green snail between us. You bought only three green snails? But there are four of us. Shuichi's always late. Why didn't you come home together? There you go, Father. Kikuko, what was the name of that maid that left us recently? - You mean Kayo? - Ah, that's it. Kayo. A few days before she left us... ...I was putting on my geta and I thought she'd seen a sore on my foot. "You have a blister," she said to me. She used the word "o-zure"for blister, adding the polite prefix... ...and that impressed me! However, when I thought about it later, she didn't mean "blister"... ...she meant "ozure" meaning the thong on the geta! Kayo's accent was rather strange. Kikuko, say the word "ozure" meaning blister for me. O-zure. - Now say "ozure" meaning thong. - Ozure. While you're talking, dinner's getting cold! Eh? O-zure!!! Ozure!!! O-zure, ozure!!! Welcome home. - Will you eat something? - Not hungry. - The bath's ready for you. - Don't need one. Just wash your face with this. Kikuko. Kikuko! Yesterday Miss Tanizaki said one of her friends was looking for work as a maid. I see. But wouldn't that be a rather difficult situation? Why? You need a maid, don't you? But won't this friend of Miss Tanizaki's repeat things about you to Kikuko? Nonsense, she won't say a word! Well, as long as she's suitable. Has Miss Tanizaki said anything to you about me? Not a word. - Seems like you've made sure of that. - I resent that. It would bring shame on you, if I were to carry on with your secretary. Of course it would. But what if Kikuko were to find out? So, Miss Tanizaki has been talking to you. But she still goes out with you... ...when she knows you're seeing another woman? Seems so... That's what she's like. You never fail to amaze me. I'm leaving her. I intend to leave her. I just don't understand what this woman has that Kikuko doesn't. One's like a torrent, the other's like a lake. You're telling me that you've never had an affair, Father? I hate the deception. But you do understand? When it's over, I'll tell you everything. - We don't want Kikuko to find out. - Yeah. She's probably twigged already, though. Do come in. Long time no see. Satoko! Come here! Mother! Mother! Fusako is here! Fusako's here? - Do sit down. - Thanks. Hello! Oh, look at the state of you! The train was absolutely packed. Don't cling to me. - I've not seen you for ages, Satoko. - Have you said hello? - You took your time getting here. - Did you walk from the station? The bus was too crowded to get on. You must be tired, Satoko. You can all go to the well and freshen up. - I'll get towels. - I brought some. Welcome home. Fusako's here with her kids. Fusako? You came home by yourself again? What's Fusako doing here? I think she wants to stay a while. She's brought plenty of clothes. What do you think you're doing? Stop that! Why? I'm not stealing anything. That's worse than stealing! What's so bad about checking on my daughter? It seems she can't even afford to bring any food for her kids. I just want to know how she's managing. This is the cloth I used to wrap her mirror when she got married. It makes me angry just to see it. Why is she using this... ...when she's got the suitcase we bought her for her honeymoon? It'd be too heavy to carry with the baby. Anyway, she's not bothered about looks. But what will Kikuko think? This cloth is the one that I used when we got married. It probably is. No, it's even older than that. My sister used it to wrap plants before she died. It has history. - Is Father back yet? - Yes. - Can I have some of this? - Help yourself. Your father's just scolded me for having a peek in your purse. Forgive me if I was rude. Yes, you were rude! Go ahead, have a good look. That's what my husband thought if I had no money I wouldn't run off. It's empty. The situation's got to improve if your husband wants to keep his kids. Is Kikuko still not? Still not pregnant yet? Satoko, come and play over here, would you? You might get the washing dirty. Satoko! The problem is what to do about the kids. We can't split them up between me and my husband. Kikuko? Kikuko! What's happened? Just be quiet! We're in the middle of an important conversation! - Crying will get you nothing! - Is she pretending? Of course. She's just crying to get attention! When the parents can't get along, it affects the kids. - Did you call me? - Get me a handkerchief. Right, let me find something for you. Sorry. I tried, but I'm not very good at dealing with Satoko. You don't know how to treat kids. You're like a kid yourself! - My brother goes out even on Sundays? - Got people to see. I didn't think you'd help me, anyway! I said I'd talk to your husband any time you wanted. That's why your father or Shuichi should go and talk to him... ...and find out what his intentions really are. What do you think, Father? Or are you just hiding behind your paper and not taking me seriously? What can I say? Other people's marriages are impossible to fathom. Exactly. You shouldn't meddle in the affairs of others. Right. That's why I'll deal with it by myself. You can't put the blame entirely on him. Consider your own part in this. I'm not pretty enough for my husband so he just does things his way. Kikuko, would you get me a cigarette? Of course. Excuse me. I bet Father was disappointed when I was born such an ugly child. If only I'd been born as beautiful as Kikuko! Kikuko has her troubles, too, you know. You're so kind to Kikuko, aren't you, Father? My mother-in-law does nothing but moan at me all the time. That's your own fault! She always treats us so kindly... ...that we in turn treat Kikuko with kindness. It's just her husband that's hard on her, eh? See you later. Welcome home. It must be awful out there. You must get those wet clothes off. Kikuko, the whole neighbourhood can hear your music. I was playing it to take my mind off worrying about the two of you. Kikuko, you haven't played that record of lullabies much recently. - The ones from around the world? - Yes, the gift from your schoolfriend. It was a lovely wedding gift. It must be scratched to bits by now. - Did you both get soaked? - Evening! - They got soaked to the skin - Oh, dear, oh, dear... Did the typhoon damage the annex? It did indeed! It's in a terrible state now. - "Oh, dear, oh, dear!" - Father... The electricity's down. There's a blackout. - I can see that! - Get the candles out. I wonder if they're alright at Fusako's. They probably made up and went to bed early on a night like this. She was determined to go home and sort the whole thing out. No news is good news, I suppose. Perhaps they've made up after all. They can't simply leave the house with two kids to carry. Trying to escape from a storm like this... ...they'd have to carry his mother along as well. She probably can't move with her neuralgia. Apparently, she manages to walk. But it must be hard for her on a stormy night like this. It is hard for everyone everywhere. Things were so different before Fusako got married. It depresses me to see her like this. It's strange, though... Kikuko always cheers me up whenever I talk to her. That's your fault, you know? You show affection only for Kikuko. - That's not true at all. - It is so. You've always shunned Fusako and favoured Shuichi. That's just how you are. Even now, when it seems Shuichi's seeing another woman, you say nothing! You show so much pity for Kikuko, but it's actually cruel, you know? She doesn't show how jealous she feels so as not to upset you. I feel so sorry for Fusako. I feel as though I forced her back home. Well, tell her to come back, then. I know, but she's almost thirty now... ...and she can't expect her parents to arrange a divorce for her, can she? I just feel so sorry for her, she has such a burden to carry in life. Did you tell her how you feel for her? I always make it clear when I don't agree with something. It's a terrible situation for both the parents and the kids. And it's all your fault! No, it's a lie. I was just about to stick my tongue out at you! You're always teasing me! My sister was so beautiful, wasn't she? I didn't feel any jealousy, but I always felt I was neglected. But I got over it. If she hadn't died, you'd probably have married her instead, right? That's all in the past! You were just unlucky. Shall we get some sleep? Old couples don't often sleep well Together. Don't I know it! Kikuko? Hello? Mrs Ogata? - Coming! - Telegram for you. Thank you very much. Kikuko, you said you liked these flowers, didn't you? They've really grown. Oh, they're so lovely. Looks like a telegram! Eh? What do you mean, "looks like"? Looks like it's from back home. Someone's probably passed away or something. Put these in a vase for me. It says that Fusako and the kids have arrived there. She ran out on him again? - No word from her husband at all? - No. He'd never dare to show his face around here, would he? But you'd have thought Fusako would've come back here. You should show a little more concern for her than you do. We should all try to consider the situation from Fusako's point of view. You can't guarantee that Kikuko won't run off if she finds out about Shuichi. When do parents ever stop worrying about their children's marital woes? You have absolutely no understanding of women. Men don't experience sadness the way women do. So, because you're a woman... ...that means you can understand the feelings of all other women? Shuichi didn't come home again last night. Why do you not come home together? You come home and let Kikuko look after you instead. That's just not right. Can't you get Shuichi to help with Fusako's problem? Maybe we can get Shuichi to go and bring Fusako back here. I don't know about that. Shuichi's got no respect for Fusako. Anyway, it's embarrassing enough that our house there must be in ruins. What's happened to Fusako? She's gone up to Shinshu and installed herself in that empty house. Oh, dear... Miss Tanizaki, I'll be out of the office for two or three days. - A business trip? - Kind of. - Where? - Shinshu. Please take care of yourself, it's cold up there. - So, you're off, then? - Yes. She's such a nuisance. You can talk! I'd promised to take her dancing tonight. Really? Take my father instead. You'll enjoy it. I'm sorry about this evening. He's been so unreliable recently. How about I take you instead? You know this woman Shuichi's seeing? Is she a dancer? She's nothing to do with the dance hall Is she young? Well... she's younger than his wife. Is she beautiful? Yes... she's very attractive. She has a husky voice. He seems to think it's erotic. A voice like she's got a nose cold? Do you often see her at the dance hall? No, not all. Has Shuichi introduced her to you? No, not formally. I just don't understand it at all. Why does he drag you along every time he meets her? To make her jealous? I'm not one to interfere. I wish you would interfere! She always turns up with somebody, too. Oh? She brings along a man? No. She brings a female friend. That's a relief! I've heard about these swapping parties! - They share a house together. - Two women together? Yes. - Have you ever been to their place? - Yes... Where is it? What do you intend to do? Don't worry, I won't involve you. Are you going to meet with her? If you are, I'd recommend that you talk to her friend first. She's a teacher, right? Shall I arrange for her to come into the office? Shuichi always gets drunk there... he raises hell. He always asks her friend to sing for him I never realised he had such a drinking habit... She sings beautifully, and Kinuko always ends up weeping. Eh? That is why, I think, Kinuko will listen to this friend. If Shuichi finds out about this, I'll never be able to face him again. You must let me resign. It's just around that corner. I don't want to show my face. I'm sorry for all the trouble... ...but let's not do this today. Why not? You've come this far. Wouldn't it be worth it if it brought you peace at home? Knowing Fusako, I bet she won't have brought enough nappies for the kids. - Shall we make some up for her? - Let's do that. Morning! What brings you here so early? You remember Mizuta who died recently? Mizuta? Yes. We all received some fine tea as a funeral gift. I've got a taste for it now. High-quality stuff, wasn't it? I tell you, I wouldn't mind going the way he did ... ...dying in the arms of a beautiful woman while bathing at a spa! There's hope for you yet! Yeah, but my blood pressure isn't so high. "Old as I am, I regret never climbing Mt. Fuji." What do you think? "Old as I am, I regret never climbing Mt. Fuji." Is it a dirty joke? Don't be so daft! What? I suppose life's a lottery, isn't it? If you end up stuck with a dreadful wife, wouldn't you want to top yourself? I guess so. - What brings you here? - Eh? Oh, yeah... I was asked whether I wanted to buy this mask from Mizuta's estate. Have a look. It's a Noh mask. It's supposed to be a child. Hey, put this over your face, would you? You want me to put it on? Like this? Slowly turn your face upwards. And now, look down slowly. What do you think? Seems it has a life of its own. Welcome home. You must be tired. Thanks for having us again. Satoko! Come inside. Satoko... - Is the bath ready? - Yes. I feel it's my fault if you decide to resign from the company. It was insensitive of me to make you take me to that woman's house. It was awful. But you're only doing what any father would do. I feel slightly depraved... ...tagging along with him to that woman's house. My behaviour has been unacceptable. But hardly depraved, though. If I do have to resign... ...then I'll go and talk to Kinuko as a farewell gesture. There's no need for that. I just don't understand him. I would never feel jealous about him and his wife if they got along well. But his fooling around with Kinuko really disgusts me. Maybe he wants something more than his wife can give him. Like what? Whenever he talks about his wife, he says she's just like a child. A child? Yes. In so many ways. He says that to you? Yes. He says it to me and to Kinuko. "She's a child, that's why my father's so fond of her." But he hasn't said it recently. He can't force his young wife to act like a prostitute. What a fool! He said it would work... ...if he fooled around with other women. You've talked about this with him? Welcome back home. - Out shopping? - Yes. - Fusako's back. - I see. Special dinner tonight! - Don't be long! - I won't! Kikuko? Kikuko! - Yes? - Will you bring the persimmons through? Coming! Read to me, Mummy You can read it yourself. - These are sweet. - Are they? These two are just silently knocking it back. Father hasn't drunk that much, has he? I've been thinking... ...about Father's life. Eh? What exactly about my life? I'm only thinking in very broad terms... ...but if I were pushed to make a conclusion... ...has your life been a success or a failure? And you think you know which? Well, if a man manages to live his life without much strife, then it's a success. You're right, there. But success or failure as a parent is a different matter. That's judged on the success or failure of their children's marriages. And it seems I've failed. You really think so, Father? Just stop that, you two. Fusako's here. Mummy, I'm tired. Me, too. What's happened, Kikuko? - Nosebleed? - Yes. Kneel down When it stops bleeding, go to rest. It's still early. I'm sorry... - Are you feeling dizzy? - Just a little. - Get some rest this morning - I will. A cool breeze was blowing when I went out for the papers and I feel better now. A woman's nosebleed is nothing to worry about. Well, it was serious. You were up early this morning, Father. I've no idea why I woke up before the temple bell rang. You're up, too, Satoko? "As a pilgrim I wander... ..."and offer thanks for the grace of my parents..." You know that scar on Kikuko's forehead? Of course. It was made by the doctor's forceps during her difficult birth. She probably never felt any suffering at birth... ...but the scar shows whenever she seems in pain. She had a nosebleed this morning, right? The scar shows when she looks pallid, that's all. - You knew about it? - She told me this morning. So what? I've been wanting to talk to you about Kikuko. Look, I'm dealing with the situation, so there's nothing for you to say. I have been trying not to say anything. Off to see my father? Yes. - This is Miss Ikeda. - I'm Mr Ogata. Pleased to meet you. Shall we go somewhere else? This place is fine with me. Very well. - Miss Ikeda has come especially. - I'm very grateful. Miss Ikeda also thinks that your son must leave Kinuko. Really? - Some lunch? - We've eaten. Coffee, then? Coffees. As I live with Kinuko... ...I feel partly to blame for the situation. Few women nowadays would give up a man simply because he's married. Kinuko always says to Shuichi whenever they get drunk... ..."Go tell your wife that! "It's not like you've gone away to war. "She knows you'll be coming home. "Even if you have affairs, she should be glad that at least you come home!" That's absurd talk. Yes. But she's drunk whenever she says it. But your son is just as bad. Shuichi completely loses control of himself. He's always forcing Kinuko to sing. So I was told. Kinuko hates singing... ...so I end up singing in her place to placate him. If she doesn't, he goes crazy and the neighbours... Right? After Shuichi has left to go home... ...Kinuko often says that the whole torrid affair will be the ruin of her. All the more reason why they should split. She can support herself. Kinuko is a dressmaker. A dressmaker? She's highly regarded at the shop. She's never troubled Shuichi for any financial support. I believe you. Couldn't he and his wife live separately from you? If just he and his wife lived together... ...I'm sure it'd be easier for him to leave Kinuko. If they don't move out and get their own place, then I shall. It's better for you to stay here with us. No way. I'll go elsewhere. That'd be better, right? The situation has nothing to do with you. Oh, yes, it has! It has a great deal to do with me. My husband said my character was deeply flawed... ...because father never showed me any love. I had to choke back the tears when he said that to me. Just calm yourself down. Nothing definite has been decided yet. I can't calm down! The moon looks so beautiful tonight, Mother. - Kikuko, here's father's hot-water bottle. - Right. Careful! Are you in pain? Good morning. Forgive me, I overslept. That's alright, take your time. You drive everyone mad getting up so early, my dear. I had to listen to Shuichi groaning all night. It was awful. So sorry. Why are you dressed like that? I guess my husband's slovenliness has rubbed off on me. You should've checked him out more closely before you made me marry him! Good morning. Morning. Do you fancy going to see a movie today? No? I'd love to go, but... We have to discuss the new maid, dear. Who knows what your father intends to do, sweetheart? It's been a fortnight since Fusako walked out on him. You call Fusako slovenly, yet you can't be bothered to do anything to help her! You're all talk and no action when it comes down to solving her problems. She's had to move back here to escape her husband. She's not even divorced yet, no wonder she's upset. Don't just stand around like that! Get yourself dressed! Sorry to keep you waiting. Father, I have to go ahead and drop by the Iwasaki Corporation. - No breakfast? - No, thanks. Thank you for waiting. What's ailing your friend? She's feeling weak after childbirth. Oh, I see. It's so beautiful! All the leaves have turned red. You've always got so much on your mind that you never notice things. Oh... I should try to take more notice. Why did you have no breakfast this morning? I had to rush because I wanted to leave with you. You go out so rarely, of course I'd have waited. I've been thinking... ...maybe the two of you should get your own place. The wife and I talked it over last night. Why? Is it because Fusako has come back? No, it has nothing to do with Fusako. I'm just thinking of you two. Do you not think it'd be better for you two? If it was up to me to choose... I'd prefer to stay. You're always so kind to me. I've been a pretty useless father-in-law to you. I never discuss important matters with you... Not at all. You don't have to say anything to me, Father... ...because I always know that you appreciate me. If I had to live away from you, Father... ...I'd feel utterly helpless. Maybe that's because you were spoiled by your parents. Anyway, I believe it's the best solution to your marital problems. Just thinking about it fills me with dread. All alone at home, waiting for him to return. Bye for now, Father. Just arrived? I've just dropped Kikuko off at the hospital. The hospital? Is Kikuko ill or something? No, not that I know of. I wonder if old people's lives really are so meaningless. It gives me the creeps, that. The face is so lifelike. It's beautiful. Is it supposed to be the face of a child? Oh, you're up? Has your headache gone? - You're not feeling nauseous, are you? - No. I see. Maybe it's just exhaustion, then. - We'll have a new maid soon, won't we? - Hm... - Sorry you have to do the maid's work. - Not at all. It's fine. Father's still playing with that thing he got from his friend that died. His family asked me to buy it. I'm thinking about it. Kikuko, there's a story in here about an old couple who killed themselves. They wrote a final letter to their daughter and grandchildren. "We think it's better to end our lives while we are still loved by our family. "If we were to linger on for years and become a burden to our family... ..."it would spoil all that we've lived for "We feel that we are far too old and weak now... ..."to advance and lead anyone along life's righteous path. "So, while we are still surrounded by a loving family... ..."and many affectionate friends and colleagues... ..."we choose to depart this life not knowing where destiny will take us. "We merely seek an endless sleep." Your father and I have discussed what we'd write in our final letter... ...if we were to commit suicide. She's so lazy, she'd leave it to me to write! Well, I'd have nothing more to add if you wrote it. What about you, Kikuko? If you were to commit suicide with Shuichi, what would you write? I have no idea. But... ...I would like to write something to you, Father. What strange behaviour! What's she crying about now? Maybe it's hysteria? Yes, it must be an attack of hysteria. Kikuko? Yes? The machine keeps snapping the thread. Would you take a look at it for me? Maybe it's showing its age. I've had it since I was a girl Don't crowd us. Sorry to trouble you, but I was afraid it might put a stitch in my hand. It might respond to your subtle touch. You must be tired. You must be, too. The only ones in this house who never seem to tire are the grandparents! Then there is one we can't fathom out at all. I'm seeing the people from the bank. Any messages? - I'll see them at tomorrow's meeting. - I see. - What was wrong with Kikuko? - It was nothing. - What was it? - It was just a headache, that's all. That's it? Your mother said she went straight to bed after coming back from Tokyo. She'll be fine in two or three days. It's nothing. Really? It's seems more than just a headache. She was crying all last night. Why is everybody so interested in what happens to Kikuko? She gets ill sometimes, okay? So what's the illness? Shuichi! Going for a walk? You're hiding something! She had an abortion. What? She saw a doctor? That's right. - Yesterday? - Yes. - You made her do it? - It was her decision. Liar! It's the truth. Why? What made her do such a thing? You could have stopped her if you'd tried. There's nothing I can do for now. She's so determined. What do you mean, "for now"? She said she refuses to have my child if I carry on the way I have been. - With that other woman? - I guess so. You guess so? Can you not see that this whole affair is killing Kikuko! It's more than just a protest against you. It's like a semi-suicide! Kikuko's just being stubborn. She's a woman! She's your wife! If you'd shown her more consideration, she'd have willingly had your child. Your affair is irrelevant. I'm not so sure. Kikuko knows we're all expecting her to give us a grandchild. Just think how ashamed she must be feeling. You're breaking her heart and destroying her hopes of ever having a baby. That's not true. Kikuko lives by her own rules. That's why she refused to have the child. I don't believe that's her real motive at all. Surely you're not fool enough to judge a woman's moods at face value? What will your mother say when she hears she's lost a grandchild? Well, at least we know Kikuko can have children now. Mother will be relieved. How can you guarantee she'll be able to have another? I guarantee it. This just proves how heartless you are! You have no love for others! You're over-complicating things. It's simple. It's not that I don't want to have children. We're both going through a bad patch. It's not the right time for us to have kids yet. The reason you're going through a bad patch is down to your behaviour! You've done nothing to make her believe in you. That's why she lost the baby. Maybe she lost more than just the baby... Welcome back. Yasuko! Yasuko! - Take the baby and let Kikuko rest - But Father... But Fusako went out and left the baby with us. - Where's she gone? - The post Office. - Why don't you nurse the baby? - Alright! I was just fixing my hair. Go and lie down, Kikuko. Very well. - Right, I'll take Kuniko. - Okay. Thank you. I'll go and fetch Fusako. - How do you feel? - Fine. - Let me get you some tea... - No. Stay where you are. Did you see that 2000-year-old lotus seed that produced a flower? Yes. You saw it? Kikuko... Things wouldn't seem so bad if only you'd confide in us. It must have been painful for you coming home that same day. You must have known for a long time. No... You always said that you wished for nothing more than to have a baby. Do you have to see the doctor again? Tomorrow, briefly. - Hello? - Coming! Oh! - Thank you for seeing me the other day. - Not at all. Actually, I've come because I wanted to see Kinuko. I see. She's not back yet. Do you want to wait? I see. Well, if I'm not imposing... Please excuse the mess. Take a seat. - Is that your child? - Yes. He lives with his father. - Is this where you do private tutoring? - Yes. I don't work as hard as Kinuko. I also visit six or seven children at their homes to tutor them. And this is where Shuichi? He's stopped coming round lately. Has he really? Why is that? I think it's better that you ask Kinuko herself. Have you talked to Kinuko? Yes. But Kinuko's strong... We have very different personalities, you see. I feel reassured having her around. - Welcome home. - Hello. Mr Ogata's father is here. To see me? Please come with me. I'm Mr. Ogata. I realise it must be strange meeting me like this... ...but the reason I'm here is that I wanted to talk to you about Shuichi. I have nothing to say to you about Shuichi. Do you expect me to apologise? On the contrary, I think I owe you an apology. I won't be seeing Shuichi again. And I won't be a threat to your family any more. That's all I have to say, isn't it? But what about the child? What child? I'm free to make my own decision. No one's going to tell me whether I can or can't have the baby! Are you expecting a baby? What's wrong with a single woman wanting to have a baby? I'm just a war widow who decided to have a child. I'm not asking for anything from anybody. I just want to be allowed to have the baby. I'm carrying the baby... The baby is mine! But... such an unnatural child... What do you mean, "unnatural"? Sorry... I don't know if I'll ever get married again... ...or whether I'll be able to have another baby. And I have no children from before. But what does Shuichi think about the baby? Did Shuichi send you here to see me? Shuichi told me not to have the baby. He punched me and kicked me... ...and he dragged me down the stairs. I've fulfilled my duty to his wife now. That wife of his has no idea what I'm going through! And you have no idea what Kikuko's going through, either. When I told him I was pregnant, he just kicked me. So I told him straight... ...that he wasn't the father of the child... ...that the child wasn't his. And that was the end of our affair. Which means? You can interpret it any way you like. It's not much, but please accept this and use it as you see fit. Anyway, I have spoken my mind. Please consider what I said. Is this consolation money? So this means that we've come to some arrangement, does it? Shall I write you a receipt for it? What on earth have you been up to? Had a few drinks with the guys from the bank. - Is everyone in bed? - Well, Shuichi's still not back yet. - Where's Kikuko? - Gone back to her parents'. Her mother phoned this afternoon and said that Kikuko was in bed sick. She told Fusako that Kikuko had arrived home feeling unwell. They'll look after her until she's well enough to come back. Welcome home. I think she wanted to go home for a rest. It's not that. Then what is it? She had an abortion. How dreadful! What is this world coming to? She probably didn't want to end up like me. But Shuichi would change his ways if they had a baby. She should have persevered. Stop blaming Kikuko! It's despicable of a man or a woman to use a baby to trap someone. If only she'd talked to us about it. I never thought Kikuko was that strong-willed. Good night. Go and play outside. Father's a strange one, isn't he? He treats her better than he does his own daughter. If you don't like the way I cook spinach then just say so. It didn't taste that bad. It still looked like spinach! I never claimed to be a wonderful cook. Spinach tastes the same whether Kikuko's here or not! You drive me mad! Food doesn't taste the same now that the beautiful couple have left. Give your tongue a rest, will you? I will not! I'll say what I want when I want from now on. I can't stop you. I'm not a child any more. You can't stop me saying what I want. Fusako, it's in situations like this that you should speak your mind. You don't have to bottle it up, now that Kikuko's not here. I'm not saying anything offensive to you. I know I can't cook like Kikuko, but you could show some appreciation. Father eats in complete silence as if it was disgusting. It gets me down! Fusako... I expect there's plenty more that you want to get off your chest. Did you go to the post office yesterday to send a letter to your husband? No, I didn't. Did you send him money? You're sending him the money we give you? Your husband's not a bad man... ...he's just easily led. I heard he's involved in smuggling. Meet him and find out what he wants to do. Otherwise the situation's just going to get worse. Do you want to go back to him? Look, I'm not asking you to do anything for me. You're right. Your father has no understanding of women. Is that so? You should settle this once and for all. All this toing and froing is no good. - Let's give it time, shall we? - Sure. But you're her brother, you talk to her. - I can never understand women. - Me neither. Well, thanks a lot. - I'll talk to my father about the Money. - Okay. Let's have a drink sometime. I'll take you to this place I know. Yes? He's not here yet. Yes... Yes... Yes, I understand. Good morning, sir. Shuichi... Good morning. Mr Hayashi from Futaba Industries just rang. He'll ring back later. Did you see Fusako's husband? - He said he'd been out with you. - Yeah. We were out all night. Seems he's working hard these days. Fusako should be more appreciative. Enough about him. I've something to discuss with you this evening, so come home early. Hello? Oh... Kikuko. How are you? Really? Of course... You got here quick. I arrived an hour ago. Really? Thank you so much for coming. Are you better now? Yes. Let's take a walk. I was so happy to hear your voice on the phone, Kikuko. That was your real voice, wasn't it? Your true voice. It's vast, isn't it? You must be relieved, too, Father. It's incredible to have such a vast park right in the centre of Tokyo. Kikuko, come and sit down. Okay. Father... What is it? Kikuko, if you have something to say to me, then go ahead and say it. You're free now, Kikuko. You shouldn't feel you're restricted by anyone. I know. When you phoned me today... ...you'd already made up your mind to leave Shuichi, hadn't you? Yes. I thought as much. I know it's a silly question... ...but if Shuichi were to beg you for forgiveness, what would you do? I would have to think it over. Shuichi said that he still loves you. That's why he's suffering now. He's ruining his life. His other woman is pregnant. You were so good to all of us. As your father-in-law... ...I did nothing to help you, Kikuko. That's not true, Father. Instead of showing support... ...I probably made the situation worse for you. Please forgive me. Father... All I can do for you now, Kikuko... ...is to set you free. I want you to be happy again. Soon the wife and I are going up to Shinshu to see the house. If things work out... ...we may settle down there. So... shall we go? It's getting cold. If we do move to Shinshu... ...please write to us from time to time and let us know how you're getting on. I shall. And Father... please take good care of yourself. I will. Dry your tears. You can't walk around with tears streaming down your face. Yes... It's so relaxing here, isn't it? "If one takes great pains to create a vista, one can see hidden depths." How do you mean? One gets an unobstructed view of everything... THE END
