I wonder if you know how it in a real fight. - Leave me the hell alone. - Shut up. It was easy to kill Gus, do you? Where's Andre? How the hell would I know? What the hell do you know? You know, in a fight, you always hit, no matter how good you are. And when you hit are those glimpses white light. You lose control of the body. You can not breathe. The arms and legs do not listen. You want to throw up, but you can not. You know why? Good. Okay, okay, okay. Listen, I tell you everything, right? I know of Kira. I did what I was told. I fucking nothing to do with it, right? I gave only the fighters, that's all, I swear. You only have given fighters? You gave more than that. You gave our lives. Why? I gave them only information. Supposed to be my friend. You have cheated. I had no fucking choice. Guy is a fucking maniac ... You know, Gus was my friend. I had no choice. We all have a choice. I have made the choice. Please Rain. I beg hell. Please.
