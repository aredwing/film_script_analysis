Is not it awesome in cannabis, THC substance? My brother Spike to burn all variations of grass. He lives in a dormitory on the other side of campus. And I thought that chivalry is dead. Thank you could you take me home. See you tomorrow at the lab. Bye. Wait! I do not even know your name. Rigo Fabian, vuosikurssi 1985. "Kemianopiskelija Rigo Fabian kuoli" - "Doing laboratory experiments with Pierre Avon." Flowers? Dr. Avon! - Tell Rigo Fabian. - Who? - According to this, he is dead. - I do not know that man. Doctor! - He brought me home. - Did he escape from here? - So you know him. Rigo! - Shh! All right, I'll tell you. - But do not breathlessly here. - I can keep my mouth shut. Can you? We have to go back to - The year of the Lord 1985. Rigo was the best student of mine. He helped develop the machine - which extend human life. He was like my own son. He was so dedicated to his head for mixing - that developed its own cannabis variety. It was so strong that Romero came to the cloud exposure to smoke. Awesome! I did not know that Rigo was also a pothead. Bongimestari. Hatsis maksimus. Jointtijtk. Dr. Ruohonen. One evening, Rigo was around the cloud - and thought zombikonetta dorm jet. The device was launched, and then began to happen. Marijuana mixed with Rigon DNA and caused a chemical reaction. The best pupils became ... - A zombie. - And her cat, too. Romero jumped into the plane at the last moment. But Rigo's really cute. Of course! Marijuana mixed with hybrid DNA - to keep her strong and young. Buns your searches Chrissy. You do not smell the dead. Is that kurpitsapiiraan fragrance? It is a blend of nutmeg, cinnamon and Old spice. I got the recipe many years ago when I dated Julia Childs. Rigon substance is injected into the sebaceous glands. On both sides. He is a neat young man. He used floss after every meal. Have you ever bitten anyone? One of the very unfortunate incident - occurred in a nightclub in 1986. It was Christmas Eve, and Rigo went to a nightclub. Young woman cast her eyes on him - and wrapped him captivated. Rigo bit the woman. Woman bitten someone else, and everyone started to bite each other - until the nightclub was full of zombies. The new wave of music died because of Rigon - and he no longer afraid to go out. He is afraid of purevansa someone, if nervous. So he lives here. Does he eat people? No, only in laboratory rats. But they will die anyway. Marijuana is the decisive factor. It dilutes Rigon blood lust. Whenever he makes a mind to indulge in - he gets raw chopped liver. It's his favorite food. But he is so endearing. Oh my God, this is terrible! Are you off the upset simply because he is dead? It does not matter whether he is a zombie. He is not the sort of brotherhood. If I do not find the kind of brotherhood in the next 24 hours - I lose my scholarship. My heart, I would already be lost. If not, then ... Chrissy! I do not wait to get rid of this. For the cream on one condition. What is the face of that effort? Huhuu? Texts, texts. Ladies and gentlemen, here speaks Professor Hagfish.

That dude needs the sun. Votes are given, and the school's cutest couple is - Christina Chrysantemum ja Rigo Fabian. "ZBE is now the most popular Brotherhood Ziering University's history."

Chrissy will be so high on drugs that will do what we want. As to deceive Rigoa. - Grow your cock and fuck me. - I'm trying.

Do not worry, I eat pills. Did you sleep with Bambi? - Stop that poked in. - For the full pyllysi wounds. - Get your hands off, PJ! - Are you going to hit? Do it! Calm down. High noradrenaline and cortisol ... Be quiet! It makes you want to hit your face up. What's new record attendance today, dude? What are you going to do? Bite me? - Are you going to hit me? - Rigo need to calm down. Does that guy pulls a cloud before a fight? 10 seconds left. - Do not condescend to this, Rigo. - Do it! - You do not know what he can do. - X, X, Y. Come on, albiinomulkero. Anna tulla! Pure! Huutakaa B! Huutakaa I! Huutakaa B! Huutakaa... - What am I tavasin? - Your name. - It is two letters. - It is hell your name! - Give me a break. - You're right. Bibi! Are you ready? 3, 2, run!

They might be monsters, but they are still students. They will continue the same stupid rvellyst - and socially bold use than when human beings.

What the hell is going on here? - The doors must be kept locked. - Oh, my God! No one is locked out. Out to celebrate it. Do you realize how much you complain of boredom? Do you realize how embarrassed you are? What now? Is pimppini really big? Perhaps the Sandvich leave residues, as pimppini is so big. Eat me, if you are going to just stand there with open mouth.

We gotta get out. Maybe they do not want me, if I acquired a sexually transmitted disease. I'm not that kind of girl. What should I do so that I could get gonorrhea?

For this reason, soothing marijuana to suppress Rigon blood lust. But how do you get the drug from the cloud? If the virus spreads through the saliva, why I'm not a zombie? I have changed a lot of spit with Rigon - and other bodily fluids, by mutual consent. Why I am not a zombie? - You gave me too much information. - Read my lips. Literally. The answer is meikkimallistoni. I thought Preparatory something pretty - but took particular huuliini hyaluronic acid and peptide B3 - with oat bran and wheat germ. Together with the marijuana they prevent the zombie virus spread - and turn their symptoms on their heads. - Are you sure that it works? - There is only one way to find it. Bring me a zombie. I hope this works. A key ingredient Meikkimallistoni is estrogen. - I'm sexy. - Physical education teachers. Correct the thing, Chrissy. I need to make estrogen-secreting hormones into non-toxic - so that I can refute gender reassignment process. Spike! Go to watch the door. The bolt that no more zombies get inside. We need to fix the thing - or all the students look from the Russian female gymnasts from whom. Okay, I'm trying to think. - Think faster! - I'm trying. - Brad? - Olen nyt Brad Lee Ann. Herpes has disappeared completely. It is the answer! Marijuana soothing properties - and the development of anti-herpes are the perfect combination. This may have an adverse reaction to Botulism or suffering from polio. - Dr. Avon? - What? Search Romero. It worked. Used in serum Rigoon - so that he can help us to fight against zombies. All right. To paskiainen? The body fucked me today with his finger. Suosikkihousuissani on paskatahroja. And all the good ruohoni is at the end - because you haisevahengityksiset and keskustelukyvyttmt - you do not PREVENT Santa, even though you paid for it. Who among you will replace this stuff? I thought so. Implement smell. A as orange, B as the bazaar. And I'm a tiger, to whom Siegfried & Roy lost. Spray you Rigoa agent. Is not this what you have wanted. - Change him back into a human. - Do you love me as man? I am in my love for you? What are you waiting for, Chrissy? Damn! It was good stuff. Are you the guys there you are, girls? Until I die, I'm KY, tastier than gingerbread untouched. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. I've been waiting a long time that I would hear what you have to say. Speak! - Why is he talking about? - He is French. Did not you know it? I knew that I forgot to tell you something Rigosta. Rigo was an exchange student from France. He studied here in scholarship. Whack, or is this dude the cleanest bastards on earth? Rigo turned into a zombie, before he understood English. Virus froze his brain, and he never learned English. That is, he is not the whole period could not read or understand English? That is, the whole time everyone gets along - he has not understood anything, what I have said to him? Pull yourself together! You have an overactive woman, and you will not be able to communicate with men. We must stop the zombies before they leave campus. Calm down and do not be so hysterical! ijisty and behave like a woman. Take a Valium and skarppaa. I've calmed down. - Why did you do that? - I do not know. I'm high. Oh, hell.

Behind it all is a woman. That was easy. This is why I do not follow the crowd species. We need to split up. I do not know how this could work. I can not even look at the "Moulin Rouge" to the end. Oh, how sweet. The real-life soap opera. We need to leave the Brotherhood of houses. Let's go hoitelemaan guys for free. Hei, horot! - This gas panettaa. - Same here. You're a sick sexy. This is still hot. Freedom. Brotherhood. Equality. Fantastic! - Is there more gas? - It is. This is hard to say, but without you - I think there should have been a woman who I was today. What? What's the matter? Oh, my God! I have to take Botox ruiskeeni. No, your body is clearly too much BOTOX. The serum is reacting negatively clostridia ... Speak English, do not fucking loser language. Zombilke and Botox do not like each other. But they made me beautiful. Change me back. - Why? - A zombie. Nucleotide sequences and the DNA sequences are combined with correctly. I'd rather be dead than ugly. Do you understand? Get out of the way! Are you hungry? Say something. - What lasts? - You are immune. - You can not change into a zombie. - Fucking moron! You suck. - I'm really sorry, Bambi! - You did this on purpose. I swear that I did not do. - Well maybe a little. - Change me back. Onset of immunity may be lifted only by feeding your body the code - programmed zombikoneeseen. Zombikoneeseen? - Please. - Lopeta! We do not understand each other. We would say no, even if we speak of, we would like to talk about. Everything has changed. We do not know each other anymore. So our thing is over. - Chrissy? - He is not the right man for me.

Drive on, old bastard. You look like Margaret Truman. Wait Rigo! - Purivatko zombies with you? - Worse. Hat them my back. - I've done stunts for 9 times. - 10th time lucky says. Is this not more? Have you used the serum yourself? - Why are you talking about hard? - A terrible famine. I could eat nachos. - And cheese. - What's the matter? They could not resist the manly my body. I've made a terrible mistake. Cheer up. Zombies have almost disappeared. - We cleaned the corners. - The problem has been corrected. - I need to get labraani. - Let's go to the scooter. Let's go to your mother's car, Kamikaze. I got to borrow it, just because of time until he gets to prison. - Give me the keys. - It is the only four-door sedan. We have to save Rigo. - Mom likes the car more than me. - We do not have to worry. His mother's car is invalid. We need some big. And the huge and long. The campus is full of zombies. Exactly.

I love you. - We have to leave. - We can not leave Rigoa. Rigon has to be within the machine so that he can use it. - I use it. - No way. He's trying to save the world because of you. Hold it!
