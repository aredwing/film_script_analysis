And then you'll realize the problems faced by tenants. Sir, don't talk like this. l apologise to you on behalf of my father. Then why do you behave so badly with the tenants.. ..and later you apologise to them. Take your keys and your money and spare me. What is this sir, you have paid the rent of only twenty days.. ..pay for the entire month at least. l don't want to put myself in trouble because of you people. The police doesn't trouble people.. ..who come from other states so much.. ..the way your father troubles the tenants. He is a lawyer, he Just spoke a bit extra? Extra? l have come across such a lawyer for the first time in my life.. ..who speaks more than a vegetable seller. l wonder what he eats. How dare you say that? Here comes your Hitler. Take care. Why are you running now? Says l am Hitler. Since so long you are troubling my son. Tell me what you want to say. Advocate Dhillon has not worn this black coat Just like that. He is feeling cold that's why he is wearing it. - Yes. What are you saying? lt's not me he is the one who is speaking nonsense. Oh my God, this house is full of fools. People keep cows as pets in the house.. ..but they have Pa in their house. What did you say? Pa. Why are you laughing? Go and fix him right now, you fool. Okay l will fix him right now. - Yes tell me. Tell me. Nothing, l was saying, don't give such high-fi bad words.. ..give bad words that we can understand. Get lost. Are you happy now? What have l done? Don't trouble the tenants. You don't allow anyone to cross even a month. You are talking about staying a month.. l wouldn't have allowed him to speak. Okay tell me, are you on his or my side? From where do l search new tenants every day? Do you survive on these rents? You are fighting with your father over here.. ..why don't you go and fight a case in the court instead. What did l make you a lawyer for? Have you made me some prominent lawyer? People only come for consultation.. ..and then they say your father does not even give good advice. l know law much better than you. Since your father is a lawyer l've appointed you as my assistant. Or else you are not worth anything at all. Since my father is a lawyer no other lawyer is ready to appoint me. They think that perhaps l am like you. ln our family, children are like fathers. Not like the opposite custom at your in-law's place.. ..that is one child is for the family.. ..and the other is for the neighbors. What did you say, father? - Nothing. You will not understand. l am not a fool. From the day l have come into this house.. ..l have never seen you father and son talking nicely.. ..l always see you both quarrelling. The breakfast is ready, have it. And for your kind information you have given time.. ..to your client at 10 o'clock in the court. lts 10:30 and you are still at home. l am not hungry, shall we leave? Why will you be hungry? You have eaten all my brains. Has the younger prince woken up or is he still sleeping. He Just finished his college studies. Let him sleep. lt's been three months l started that business for him. And that fool has not given me account of a single penny. l wonder what he is doing. Stop worrying about him, think about our work too. Come on lets go. Thank God they both left. You were awake, Jass? They don't let me sleep, sister-in-law. The cock is cursed unnecessarily. They both wake up everybody early in the morning. Who wants to hear their nonsense early in the morning. They are elder to you. - So what? The father is always elder than the son. lt would be so nice if he would have been intelligent. Since they are intelligent l've learnt so much from him. What are you trying to say, sister-in-law? Greetings, father. Did you see Parvati Kaur, l had to see such a day in life? l hardly turned my back and see what these monkeys are saying about me? Just think.. How will they take out my funeral if l die like you? Useless kids. Can't give me any happiness. Why are you looking at me, he is at fault? What did l say? Father is always elder to his son. You thought that you will fool your father? Dhillon has not worn this black coat Just like that. You don't have any other colour that's why you are wearing this. l will settle my score with you later.. ..you tell me first.. l have opened that shop for you.. ..will your father go and sit there? - Okay. Hurry up, idiot.. and go to the shop. But l have to attend my friends sister's wedding for three days. ls that important? l have to get her married. lt's none of your business at the wedding. Since l have passed out of college, marriages are the only place.. ..where l meet my friends. Why are you both troubling this poor fellow? This is his age to enJoy. Call from the client. Hello. Yes, you are in the court? We both are also in our coats. Yes let's meet. Let's meet. Let's go. We had come to take the bag. - Oh. Till date l don't understand.. ..why are you so scared of father? No need to worry, sister-in-law. Our relationship is such. We know how our father raised us after our mother's death. We Just love to tease each other all the time and.. ..that's our way of expressing our love. Okay stop talking now and eat your breakfast. See what l have cooked today. But the hen makes this. l will hit this on you. l wonder what kind of drug his mother ate when she gave birth to him. His colleagues have become officers and he still sleeping. Get up. Wake up, son. lts broad day light. Oh no. lt's fun to sleep under the sun. Do you function with the help of the solar system? That you enJoy with the sun. Get up soon. Why are you troubling me? You are the one who is troubling me. The whole world is making fun of me. They say lnspector Sikandar Singh's son is useless. He sleeps till 12 o'clock in the day. Then go and explain to those illiterate people.. ..that my son has very big dreams. You need to sleep for a longer time to see such big dreams. Stop this nonsense. Seeing big dreams. l have told you so many times to prepare yourself for the exams. l will get you a Job as ASl. Low people and low thinking. Sikandar Singh Tiwana's son will work as an ASl? Okay l am ready to change my name. You prove yourself. l Joined as a constable directly. Am l not an inspector now? You slogged so hard to become an lnspector. You used to take care of the kids of the Deputy chiefs.. ..till you were a Sub-lnspector. You still stand there in the traffic giving the tempo bills. Do you know how shameful l feel? l tell people that he is my far off distant daddy. What do you mean by distant daddy? What do you mean by far off distant daddy? l mean l have three sisters also on the way. l can count my seven generations on my fingers.. ..who have become something by working hard. To hell with the hard work of such seven generations. They couldn't even earn well enough.. ..so that the eighth generation could sleep peacefully. Look if you are not going to work then.. ..nobody will get their daughter married to you. Why do you want to bring anybody's daughter home.. ..why don't you give away your son to somebody? Daddy, l have searched a girl from a very rich family. You Just go and leave me there someday. You want to leave your father for a girl? Think technically. lf we leave the girl then she'll get married somewhere else within a year ..but my father is not going to get married.. ..he is going to stay there even after ten years. Shame on your thinking. How disgusting. You will leave your own father who held your finger.. ..and taught you how to walk? Everyone does that. No one holds the neck and teaches how to walk. You talk nonsense. Oh God! Why didn't l die before giving birth to such a son? Why didn't l die? Assume that l am still not born you can make your new programme now. l will not spare you today. My rosy complexion and my intoxicating eyes. My eyes .. my eyes.. my eyes did some mischief.. ..and there was a chaos in the city. There was chaos in the city. The girl is prettier than the moon. She roams around heaving heavily. God knows that her beauty has created chaos in the city. There was chaos in the city. Pretty damsel, that is not your fault, God has created you.

Rimpi. - Wow! PooJa. Aarti. - What nonsense are you talking? Sweety. What's there in a name? Why it's not important? lf you know the name only then you will be able to.. ..print her name on the wedding card. lf the name is wrong.. ..the wedding procession will go to the wrong place. You have given me tension. l am going to ask her name very first thing in the morning. Whose? Your sister-in-law's. Why? Are you crazy? Do you love the name or sister-in-law? What's there in a name? Listen. You should surely match the horoscopes. Nowadays girls believe in horoscopes. Horoscopes? ldiot, when we were dancing.. ..our steps were matching with each other, isn't it? - Yes. Steps match when horoscopes match. Which horoscopes? - Ours. Fool! lt's a modern world. Where do girls nowadays believe in horoscopes? You are cribbing for a horoscope. My girlfriend has never believed in a horoscope. Yours? You also get married quickly. Both of us will climb on the same horse. One horse? ldiot, you are drunk. l said on the same day.

Why are you laughing, girls Jass, since you have come.. ..you also get married soon. We will find a beautiful girl for you in the wedding. Sorry aunty, you are a bit late. l have found my girl. Who is she? Sweety. The girl agreed? l consider it that she has agreed. You distribute sweets in the village.. ..the boys lives separately from his family. At least you both will enJoy your life. How can one enJoy without the family? You have not yet dealt with your mother-in-law and sister-in-law.. ..that's why you want to show your better side. Just spend one day with my mother-in-law. ls your mother-in-law so bad? Well actually all the mother-in-laws are bad. They are too bad you can't even imagine how bad they can be. You can imagine how bad she can be. l fell like fleeing from there. l can't stay with my mother-in-law and sister-in-law. l don't have a brother-in-law also. l have one, you can take him. l am fed up of him. The moment he comes from the gym he starts ordering his sister-in-law. Serve me almond shake. Prepare soup for me. l feel as though he exercises less and makes me do exercise more. But what shall l say l have been married for seven years. l have only one child. People say its family planning.. ..but they don't know its family disturbance. God saved me; l am far better away from the family. Mahi, you also search such a boy for you who stays away from his family. Earlier l used to think like that. But now l will look for such a boy who has no family like me. He should be alone. - Yes, right. She has come. Keep this here. No problem Jass.. ..so what if your mother, father, brother and sister no one is alive. Not your fault. You have not killed them. lf it's not my fault then why did they go away leaving me alone.. ..in this cruel world. Why did they write on my hand to take care of myself? l spent my childhood happily at the child care centre. But now l have come to know what a family is my friend. This is the reason l don't take you along with me to any wedding. After seeing so many families you become upset and you are hurt. You miss your family, my friend. l miss them a lot. l miss them a lot. l feel very lonely. l Just fail to understand what l lacked in me. No you don't lack anything at all, my friend.

Come. This side. Upstairs. Have you decided to insult me in front of every client? You told them that we have not printed visiting cards. What was the need to say that? Couldn't you say that we have forgotten it at home? Mother used to say a person should never tell lies in his life. Enough. Because of these small things.. ..there had been differences between your mother and me. Thank god she is no more. lf she was still alive the differences would increase so much.. ..that the situation would come to divorce. Mother used to say. You idiots don't listen to your father. Here they are. She has come to take the upper room on rent. This is Mahi. This is my father-in-law Mr. Dhillon. And this is my husband Goldie. - Good day. Good day. You have built a beautiful house. Thank you. - We have not built it, the masons have done it. Houses are built by masons only, not goldsmiths! DalJeet, did you tell her about the rent? - Yes. Rs 7000/-. You give us Rs 6500/-. That's so nice of you. Thank you. You are welcome. lf its fine with you, can we move in today? Today? Who has seen the future? You can move in right now. l will talk to my husband and get back to you. - Sure. Sure. You talk to your husband; l'll make tea and come. - Okay. Normally you don't spare anyone Rs. 5.. ..how come you are so liberal today? Actually son, this girl looks very similar to your mother Parvati. lf she looks like my mother, we should bear a loss of Rs 500? We will consider that we gave a donation of Rs 500 for your mother. Donation? - Yes. While she was alive she craved for every penny. Useless kids. Can't give me any happiness. Hello. - Yes Mahi. Where are you? - At the shop. Guess what? - What? l found a house to stay for us. - Good. l got it along with the furniture for Rs. 6500 rent. We won't have to buy anything. - Very good. Do you think l am smart? l always thought you were smart.. ..that's why l sent you to look for the house. Listen, listen. Listen carefully. This time again your favourite.. ..Mr. Charandas is standing for election of MC. Strange. The same announcement is happening here and also at the shop? There can be two Charandas standing for the election. What are you doing in Model Town? l am standing near the house. But how do you know that l am in Model Town? The other Charandas is from Model Town. Okay. Now you put Charandas aside and come here. Note down the address. - No.. Jass.. l can't move my hands. Sms it to me. l don't understand one thing.. ..hearing good news your hands stop moving. You talk in your sleep. While you are awake you can't talk. You are happy marrying me, aren't you? Am very happy. Fine. Come quickly. Bye. Thought of anything? - No. You stand, l will think. - Okay. Thought of anything? - No. Both of us will think. From here and here. ldea! l have thought of something. Go directly to Mahi and tell her that the house.. ..in which you are thinking you are the tenant.. ..you are the owner of that house. She will be happy. l thought you were an idiot, but you turned out to be a double idiot. You think she will embrace me? She will remove her slipper and say.. ..RanJha, that one used to graze cattle, you grazed me? l don't understand what is happening. ls it bad luck of seven years? - Yes. Tell me, that is going on. We will do one thing. We will call your house.. ..and tell them the tenant that you have kept.. ..she is not a normal tenant.. ..she has direct contacts with Taliban. We will make a photo on the computer.. ..that Mahi is tying 'Rakhi' to Laden. They will throw her out. l unnecessarily called you a double idiot.. you are a triple idiot. What happened? - What do you think? They will throw her out of the house? They will call the police station for a reward. We will get out of one mess and get into another. This is a headache. Honey. - What? ldea. - What? My family has not yet seen Mahi's husband. - Yes. lf someone goes to my house as Mahi's husband. - Yes. And misbehaves with my family. - Yes. Mistreats them. - Yes. They will then throw them out. What a great idea! Amazing! But the problem is where will we find such a shameless guy. What do you mean? What do you mean? What? Now such a shameless guy is available here.. ..should we go elsewhere to look for a shameless guy? ls this friendship? - Crazy.. Get lost. Come. This is my father. And this is my brother Goldie. Hello. Father, this is my friend. My childhood friend. He is the husband of the lady whom you gave the room on rent. We met Just outside. Really. After such a long time. - Strange! When we last met, l got electrocuted after that.. ..l was stuck to open wires. And l lost my memory. A sensible person does not go near open wires. No, no.. l mean the wires were covered, my feet were open. We have heard the person who is electrocuted.. ..he recovers his memory. This is the first person we have seen who has lost his memory. By the way, it is time for me and my wife to go off to sleep. Come on. Shall we go on top and sleep together? No. This is the gate. Go out. Get lost from here. We have paid rent of Rs. 6500, for the house.. ..you all are not going to sleep here. Very good, in Rs. 6500 you want the whole house? Have you come from Bangladesh? Don't you know about the inflation in lndia? Do you see the top floor? That is yours. - That one? Yes. Rs 6500 for that? We can get that for Rs. 4500. You said your father is a lawyer? He is a thief. Hey! Why did you call my father a very big thief? When did l say 'very big' l Just said he is a thief.. ..you added 'very big' yourself. lf not today, you will say it tomorrow. You must have thought about it. Father, why did you give such a person a room on rent? l saw his wife and gave the room. Seeing him, l would not give him a bathroom on rent. And l didn't know he is your friend. l would not have given. Father, relax. Cool, cool. You feel the rent is too much? You are his friend. Give us Rs 4500. - Oh! What? Tell them.. ..speak.. Strange! One person goes in the east, one in the north and one in the south. l think you son and father are not blood related. We want to make you our tenant.. ..we don't want to do our DNA test from you. You are such a shameless guy! What are you talking? l don't understand who gave him such a beautiful girl. His wife's face will state that her husband is a rascal. - Yes. Let it be father. What have you got to do with it? Why should we say anything good or bad about others. You pick up your luggage and get lost. Get lost from here. Throw him out of here. Just go. Shut up. Being the son of such illiterate people you.. ..are throwing me out in English. Father? - Shameless man! You are telling me, 'who gave me his daughter'.. ..who gave you a degree? Did anyone not tell you that before you remove a tenant.. ..you need to give one month's notice? l see. So you will deal with us with law? ls this friendship? Take your luggage and get lost from here. Father has said it. Father has said it. This time you removed him in one day. One minute, Jass. Stop right there. You want a month's notice, right? Given. But on the 31st day, l should not see your face here. No.. l did not do it deliberately. lts better to have an intelligent enemy than a stupid friend like you. What should l do? There my father keeps saying, who will give you his daughter.. ..and here your father started saying the same. Who gave you his daughter? Why? ls there a problem in me? When l talk there is spit dripping out? Are there worms on me? lf a person falls from this terrace he will die, won't he? Dare you think of suicide when your buddy is with you. l was thinking of throwing you down. lt's good that you are stuck. This should have happened to you. You showed your status, didn't you? Your father showed his status. He has no respect. l insulted him so much, he did not feel anything. Your father has good capacity. - You did not insult him. What you did.. he faces everyday in the court. There was no power in your insults also. Normally after a marriage a guy is stuck.. ..this is the first time that a companion is also stuck. Now he will be stuck. - What do you mean? Like my family does not know who is Mahi's husband.. ..the same way Mahi does not know.. ..who is the younger son of this family. You are.. You know that. l know that. But Mahi does not know that. What? What do you mean? No! Get lost! Not at all! Not at all! l was the best actor in nursery. Don't you worry Thank you sister-in-law. New sister-in-law, first time water. Brother, is this your house? l also came to know a short while earlier that this is my house.. ..and l am their son. l am Joking, this is my own house. l am Just Joking. Sister-in-law will be happy. You were saying his father is an argumentative person. But l liked uncle very much. Oh! So this is how he praises my father? l have also spoken well about uncle No, no. What is good about my father? l have not seen a more useless person than him. l am ashamed to call him my father. You won't believe it, when we would be asked to write.. ..an essay on father, l would leave my 15 marks paper and.. ..come back but l could not write anything good about this father. Looks like there is a lot of anger in his mind. You also curse this father with bad words. Why are you talking so much when the topic is closed? We will leave the house tomorrow. What do you mean? Meaning that when they came to know that l am his friend.. ..they gave me a month's notice. They said vacate the house. We also have respect.. we will vacate the house tomorrow. How will we vacate the house? After marriage is this the only work l have left? Sometimes here and sometimes there. l will go and talk to uncle. No, no, you sit. Meaning you go and cook. l will go and see. l will talk to them. l will go and talk to them. - Sit down. What nonsense were you talking? Brother.. - Yes. Brother, please have lunch and go. Why don't you want to have lunch? You will go hungry from your friend's house? Okay, l will have. Sister-in-law, make French beans. l love eating French beans. - Sure! French beans? l see.. any other requests? Add clarified butter also. - Sit here. l will go downstairs and talk to father. Don't talk any more nonsense. Keep your mouth shut. Crazy man! No one has taught him how to talk. Fool! Crazy! ldiot! Donkey! What nonsense are you talking? Father, l am not saying this. He is saying this. Before giving the room on rent, atleast check the person. Should l do an ECG to check the tenants? What does he say? - What does he say? He is cursing. - Cursing? A client for whom you lost a case must have not.. ..given you so many bad words as many as he is giving. Why me? lt is father's fault. The one who has such a useless son like you.. ..people will give bad words. Useless kids. Can't give me any happiness. But why me? lt is brother's fault. What? l will not spare him. Sit down, brother. You should not talk to such guys. You should stay away. - You mean should we go and stay outside? Shut up! All friends are likewise. He is your friend after all. l will not spare him. Dhillon has not worn a black coat Just like that. Yes. He has darned it and worn it. l will.. - Go ahead. Today you go ahead and curse me. What difference will it make to you? My wife will be cursed. Hey, where are you off to? l am going to the shop. ls it your father's shop that it runs till midnight? We have got a big order. For a few days l will have to go to the shop in the night. ln the night. Get lost! Hey! Can't you stand in your own space? Why are you troubling me? What are you doing here? Am catching a kite. - Where is it? Pull me inside. Will you take an interview over here? Come, come. Take care. What is happening? From today, this is our door. We will come from here and go from here. Why? There is a nice staircase there. We were also nice. My family thinks you are Mahi's husband. What will they think? Where is he going in the middle of the night? Now shut up and go down this. But listen to me. You are so strange. You get down right now. Buddy.. you are a strange friend. At the age of climbing on a horse you are making me get down. ls this friendship? Mahi will come. Get down fast. Put the ladder on the side and again in the morning.. ..set the ladder and come up again. You mean, l have to come again in the morning? For a whole month. You have to climb down everyday and climb up everyday. Thank god my sisters did not hear this otherwise.. ..they would go crazy singing songs everyday. Jass! - Go, go. Coming. How did the ladder come here from the store? Have you locked your tongue for tasting only? You are making actions.. can't you speak. What are you doing with the ladder here? At this age, what will l do with a ladder? On my marriage also four people.. ..had lifted me and made me climb the horse. How did the ladder come here? Have l brought it here? How do l know? Besides you and the ladder who else is there? You are there. - l Just came now. That is what l repent on, why did you come to this world? My day today is bad! Useless son! Want to put your hands on your father. Put your hands on your mother. Put this in the store. Look at him! He has destroyed my sleep and look at how he is sleeping. Get up! What is the time? - l don't know what the time is.. ..but if it gets a bit more late we will get beaten. Mahi! Mahi! Sorry! Sorry! l had come to give tea. Looks like both husband and wife get up late. Sister-in-law is gone. Sister-in-law has come again. Good morning, sister-in-law. Two.. What two? Earlier there were two.. - What two? What? - l had made two cups of tea. Okay. Thank you. Thank you twice. Good morning. Good morning, sister-in-law. Mahi, earlier you were outside and inside.. Sister-in-law, you know, house work is like that.. ..sometimes inside.. sometimes outside. l had made tea and come for both of you. Thank you. You have not yet got up? Get up now. Sit far. - What? You forgot? Whose plane is standing outside? You and your habit of talking in your sleep. Put on Doordarshan channel. The tea is cold. l will reheat the tea and come. Get up before l come back. l will move the elephants and the horses aside first. - Oh! Get up! Get up! Go outside quickly. Fast. We have escaped narrowly. Come from the stairs. Jass, you are not yet up? l've reheated the tea and come. Thank you. Now tell me, what are you doing today? Nothing much. Just at the shop. Let's go for an outing. We are already roaming. l mean, where do you want to go? - Market. l want to buy many things for the house. l will quickly get ready and come with you. Acting like a boy.. will get ready quickly. Behave like a girl. Take 2-3 hours to get ready. l will wind up 2-3 Jobs till the while. And l will meet you at the market at 12 o'clock. Okay? You won't be late, will you? Me and late? Never. Okay. Good morning. - Good morning. You have come? - Yes. Your friend Just left. - l know. He has gone? Why are you surprised? Go freshen up. Your sister-in-law will bring breakfast for you. l am not hungry. And l am very tired. And l am also very sleepy. When you clean the lentils atleast remove your coat. Why do you insult law? You may say anything to me but don't say anything about law. Law is our livelihood. What nonsense are you talking? Can l go and sleep? - Go. l am very tired, brother. No one should disturb me. No one will do so. Get lost. Brother, if you speak so loudly the whole neighbourhood.. ..will be disturbed, l will be sleeping in the next room. Lower your voice. Lower. DalJeet. DalJeet. - Yes. l have cleaned the lentils.. ..if you want me to make the dough, tell me. - Okay. One should have the meals at the hands of his wife. Even if he has to polish his shoes. One should have the meals at the hands of his wife. l am not so lowly. That l will polish the shoes that are thrown down. Then? - Give them to me in my hand. l feel ashamed of myself. Such a useless son l have. What happened, father? Where is Mahi? - What is the matter? l asked, where is Mahi? Mahi has gone for shopping with her husband. She has not gone with her husband. She is roaming about with our Jass. For the sake of God.. ..if you want to throw the tenants out, l will do so. Don't blame your son unnecessarily. He is sleeping inside. My eyes are not spoilt that l can't see. l have seen with my own eyes, they were stuck to each other. Oh father, what rubbish are you talking? Wow! My son can do such rubbish acts and l can't even talk rubbish. Jass has been sleeping since morning after he returned from the shop. You see for yourself. l told you he was sleeping inside. Why are you all disturbing me? A cock-eyed daughter is better than a spoilt son. Where were you half an hour earlier? l was sleeping here since 9am after l returned from the shop. You have woken me up before time. l want to wake you up, son. l did not understand. -What will you do by understanding? You listen to what father is saying. You think l am crazy? Advocate Dhillon has not worn a black coat Just like that, He has washed it and worn it. - l will.. Have you woken me up to tell me this? Please.. please you go.. please sister-in-law, everyone go. l.. Why had you locked the door from inside? So that no one disturbs me. But why are you all acting like the CBl? Let me sleep. Go to sleep. But don't lock the door from inside. lt's a limit. l will remove the lock. Please let me sleep. Please. l am very tired. Father, please go. Please. Yes. lf your mourning is over, shall we start cooking? You want to cook by boiling? How is this possible? You can make a mistake sometimes. Mistake. And that too by Advocate Dhillon. l can tell how many passengers are there in a plane while it is flying. Then too you can differ by 5-7. They may have gone to the bathroom. Useless kids. Can't give me any happiness. - Good day, everybody. From where have you come? Shopping. - With whom? With my husband. - Did you hear? For Rs. 4500 rent you will betray your father. Father, you too. - Madam, you go ahead upstairs. Sorry for the inconvenience. Comes with us and goes with someone else. Acting smart. Have some shame, your daughter-in-law is standing here. Let her be. Have l pulled the sofa beneath her? Let her sit. You have spoilt the life of the tenants. Our whole life is spoilt. You will realise when a tenant will drag you to court. They will drag me when they will but l will drag you right now. DalJeet! Out of work lawyers sitting at home and discussing. Goldie, no one in the neighbourhood respects your father.. ..atleast you respect him. What do you think? Before your respect crosses my threshold.. ..tell me truthfully where have you come from? From here. l did not ask the direction, l asked the location. What is happening? What is happening? l had gone with my wife for shopping. Have l committed a crime? Your wife has returned a long time ago. And you are coming now? Ladies first. Anyway the tire of my motor cycle was punctured.. ..so l sent my wife earlier. - ls it? So your wife has come on one tire? There are rickshaws in the city too. Tell me.. ..should l make my sweet and delicate wife stand in the sun. ls your sun still up at 9 in the night? Actually.. Uncle, when l feel.. unlimited hunger.. Stand properly like a man and talk. When l feel unlimited hunger.. l told you don't take me too easy. Stand properly and talk. l can't talk like that.. When l feel unlimited.. Stop me here. l will go that side. Hey, you are troubling my son. Tell me whatever you want to say. When l am very hungry then l speak nonsense. First let us go and eat. Today we will feed you here. Oh, you have made dinner? Do our meals come from the Gurudwara? Be a man and reply to my questions truthfully. Why don't you make a court here? Whoever comes, first ask him questions. Where did you come from? Why did you come? From where? Where are you going? Strange. lf you don't like us, don't keep us as tenants. Why don't you throw our luggage outside? Very good! So that you can file a case on me later.. ..that advocate Dhillon.. ..threw us out of the house before the one month notice. Hello, listen to me. l am talking to him. Goldie, from now on l will come late to the house. What time does he sleep? He is after you full on. How much more should he? - After him..? You don't trouble the tenant. He is troubling me. He has come five minutes after his wife. What puncture can be fixed in five minutes? ln five minutes you can barely fill air. He has scrambled my brains. Put extra clarified butter in my lentils. Where are you going now? l had told you, l have to go to the shop in the night. We have got a big order of bricks. Have you forgotten? Why are you staring at me, as if you don't recognise me? What has happened today? - Nothing. Nothing has happened. Work with dedication. Good. Wonder what has happened to all of them. One goes, the other comes. One goes, the other comes. What are they doing? Saved! Listen to me. What sort of a father you have? So much investigation the immigration person.. ..at the airport does not do as much as he does. Do you have the status to go to the airport? The amount of noise you have made and come.. ..no one will let you come to a bus-depot. Get lost. You are the limit. People get work done and give food to eat. You are sending your friend hungry. My hunger has died and you are starved? Get lost! Then who told you to go around the market embracing sister-in-law? She was your own, not a stranger that she will not meet you again. lf l push you down then no part of yours also will be found. Who is it? - Gorilla. l mean, Billa. Billa. Billa. First the moon comes up.. Then the stars come up. Today again the ladder is here? How did it come here? l think l will have to climb up and find out. To which mother are you going to donate upstairs? Son, l am not going anywhere, you are mistaken. What is the ladder doing here? - ls messing around. You want to lift it? You don't listen to me. l said, before l came the ladder was kept here. l am your son, but l am not that crazy. Speak softly, l was Just.. What are you blabbering? Now l have understood.. why you added extra clarified butter in the lentils. Useless son! You talk all nonsense. l added extra clarified butter in the lentils.. ..as my brain nerves were stiff. At this age why do you want to soften them? You stop.. DalJeet, you here? Okay.. that's why you were saying sleep quickly. DalJeet, you are mistaken. l have not brought this ladder here. Father has brought it. He had brought it yesterday too. - Very good. You can't bring fame to my name.. ..instead you are defaming me. DalJeet dear, l am surprised myself. Everyday the ladder is kept here. Why are you looking at me? Whenever l have climbed the ladder it is to remove the spiders. Now will you do circus here all night? Now why are you staring like that? Get down, give a hand to your mother and keep it in the store. You have destroyed me. Destroyed me. You have wounded me in love. ln love. You have destroyed me. You have wounded me in love. lntoxicated in your love.. ..he keeps waiting for you. l have engraved your name on my chest. With the grace of God, l have seen the world. But since the time you have come into my life.. ..this world does not matter to me. With the grace of God, l have seen the world. But since the time you have come into my life.. this world does not matter to me. Only a lucky guy will have your henna imprints outside his house. l have engraved your name on my chest. Preet.. Preet, listen to me. l am the type of person who gets up at 1.30 everyday.. ..l got up at 7 am, the clock started laughing. What is his problem? You are not talking. A boy is coming to see me. Hello. What boy is coming to see you? How does it matter to you? He is from Gidadbane. Happy. Hello. Who is this Happy who is hell bent on making me sad. Happy from Gidadbane. He must be making some sweets there. You have a factory to make helicopters here, right? Loser. That is not the thing. l love you. And listen, if you marry anyone else. l will tie a nail to my body and l will come under your car. l will die, but none of your tires will also be saved. You will know when there are fireworks near Batinda. l don't understand, Honey. Why are you running after me? Where am l running after you, my shoes are biting me anyway? You are not ready to stand and listen to me. Hello. Listen to me. lt's a request. l request you. Refuse the boy. l have put such a song as my ring tone which has your name on it. l am in love (Preet) with you, beloved. Honey, Honey, don't sing. Please. l swear, l will never sing all my life. You Just refuse the boy. Okay. And l will sit unmarried all my life. You will not talk to your parents. Parents? l mean they are elderly.. how many years will they live. We will wait for a few years. - Honey, listen to me carefully. l will not get married against my parents wish. And if you really love me, bring your dad and talk to my parents. Otherwise come to meet me sometime. Gidadbane. The place where a bus does not go directly from Jallandar.. ..l should come there to give your children gifts. l will have to make arrangements to keep you in Jallandar. This is what l wanted to talk to you about. Are you done? Tell me one thing truthfully. Do l look crazy? By actions you look like but by your face you don't look like. Atleast you cleared one thing that l don't look crazy. l have cleared, right? Now come on get up and go to the girl's house.. ..and talk about my marriage. What should l tell them? What does the boy do? Tell them he is after her since long. No, l mean what does he do for a living? The extra income that you get from the police station.. ..file my tax returns from that. You are sitting at the police station. And you are talking about extra income. You yourself are not set. Your father who has Just got set.. ..you will upset him. l tell you the whole mistake is of the people of my mother's side. They sent their daughter with you. From your side you say with pride.. ..that l took fireworks to take your mother. And now at my time, you have fizzled out. l cannot spoil the life of another's daughter. You can spoil your son's life. You keep breaking small eggs here. Come with me, we will go for the hen. HarJeet, come here quick. Yes, sir. Ready the machine. How do we run the machine? There is no electricity. Then run the generator. There is no diesel in the generator too, sir. The tempo we caught in the morning.. ..it is filled with diesel, remove it. Yes, remove it. Remove the diesel from the tempo. l will anyway publish it in the Newspaper that my father is corrupt. l have been wanting to publish in the newspaper.. ..since such a long time that my son is an idiot. Daddy, listen to me, my marriage will take place there. But this will be the first marriage where the entire city.. ..will go in the marriage procession, only the father will not go. Listen to me. lf you take any wrong step.. l will bring the entire wedding procession.. ..along with your companion to the police station and beat them up. This will be the first marriage when there won't be gifts given.. ..but there will be beating. l don't know about the beating.. ..but there will surely be dancing in this police station. What happened? - Let me die, Jass. No Honey, wait. Don't stop me, my friend. Don't stop me. l am not stopping you. Wait for a month. Let my problem be solved then l will kill you myself. Very good! People have friends who are like their father.. ..but my friend is Just like my father. l feel like clapping on this. But l can't do so otherwise l will fall. Let it be. Come down. Come down, we will talk. l will come down. But tell me should l climb down.. ..or should l leave this handle and come down with a bang. Meaning? - Meaning, if you solve my problem l will climb down. Otherwise l will leave this handle and come down.. ..and bang down like a fire-cracker. Buddy, you come down. lf your problem is solved then fine.. ..otherwise climb up again. To hell with your friendship. lf one has such friends there is no need for enemies. l should make my daddy.. - Yes. Your daddy. - Yes. And introduce him to your father-in-law. - Yes. Are you crazy? - Why? Are we in less trouble that we should get into more trouble? Wow! Your problem is a problem, mine is not.. When you need, l help you. When its my turn, you turn away. Did you forget we sat here and when you were in a problem.. ..l helped you. Every brick is a witness of this. All the bricks are sold. Yes, all the witnesses of the poor are sold out. Bricks are sold! l told you, give me Rs. 50000 loan. 'Where should l give from?' 'No brick was sold.' Talks nonsense Listen. - What? Can you see that man there? After this, make that man Mahi's husband and take him home. l am leaving. - Sit. You are the first Honey that makes me feel like poison. Okay, then l will leave. - Sit, buddy. Let me think. You are in love? You have not told us earlier? - Tell us. ln our family, has anyone fallen in love? Shut up. You know better than me about our family? Father has not worn a black coat Just like that. - Yes. You stay away from me. Ask him. Who is the girl? - She is from Dasud. She is very beautiful. ln our times the Tandhe ones were beautiful. Her mother is from Tandhe. Strange. You did not tell us earlier. Why will he tell you earlier? Your aunt is wed there? What is it to me? She is your sister. You keep all your talks to yourself. You are the first lawyer due to which the Judge was changed. Finally the child is improved. Again you will spoil him. l will not do any such thing, but for God's sake don't fight.. ..make the girl's side run away. You have Just finished your studies.. ..what is the rush to get married? He is not in a rush but in a tremendous rush. What do l tell you? l wish that l get him married with my own hands. Will we get stuck? The amount we have got stuck because of you.. ..it will be lesser than that. The house is huge. We will have to do a huge marriage. We will have to give a lot too. Very good Mr. Buller, all the money of the fixed deposit.. ..spend it on the marriage.. l will swim and go to Canada. You son of a.. - Mother.. Don't insult us when we come outside. What a husband you have? Come dear. Come. Hello, daddy. Hello mother. - Hello. Hello. We are blessed that you have come to visit our 125 floor house. With your visit, our big house has become bigger. Hello.. hello.. hello.. This boy is our very good tenant. Good tenant? Means.. l pay the rent on time. Why are we standing outside? Shall we go inside? Please come. - Come. Come. - What is this? Come please. They have come. - Please come. Hello. - Hello. Welcome. Welcome. This is our full family. Father. - Father. Brother Goldie. Sister-in-law Golden. Today he is talking a lot. Please sit. Please sit. Thank you. Please sit. Please sit. Mr. Buller, what we heard about your daughter.. ..she is much better than that. This is my wife. - l know. You are from Tandhe. My son had told me that you do farming. Yes. What does your son do? Right now he is Just troubling us. The same as us. l mean, right now he has failed in college. But now he will work hard. Mr. Buller means that when l go to Canada.. ..and fling my t-shirt around then l will do a Job there. Yes. Son, how much do you earn? Earning is so much that Preet will be happy. There is no account of the earnings. What do you say? - Yes. What else do we need? The fixed deposit is saved. Mr. Buller, after Parvati Kaur has left us.. ..these two children.. ..l know how l have brought them up. You have given them good principles. But Mr. Dhillon, why has your elder son cut off his hair? Younger one has also cut. He is out of our hands. No problem, Mr. Buller, come home today.. ..l will teach you a good lesson. Adhu.. - That's not there, l will give an orange. No son. No. That is my son's name. Strange. A sensible man does not keep the fruit with this name in his house. You have kept a son. We like your son. We don't like our son, how did you like? Very good, Mr. Buller, you are insulting me a lot. No problem, before going to Canada.. ..l will tear your passport and go. And l will go there and only call mummy. My son! - How will you call your mummy? What? Because your mother is from Tandhe, we are ready for the alliance. We will enJoy and the others will not. SurJeet, our relative is a hopeless guy! Come, give me a hug. Congratulations! The tea is here. Come and bring some sweets also and.. ..give our relative who is from Tandhe. Before my in-laws come to know that l am not advocate Dhillon's son.. ..and am lnspector Sikander the marriage should take place. Honey! Very funny. l am scared. No, no. Just take this knife and stab me in the stomach. Are you kidding? No l am serious. l myself will give testimony in the court.. ..that l have committed suicide myself and no one has killed me. Are you in your senses? What happened? l will tell you later, first you stab me. Tell me first. lf there is a reason to stab l will do so. Understood? The thing is my father does not want our marriage to happen. What? But he said yes for the marriage. He has said yes in such a way at six places. He is greedy for dowry. The one who gives him the maximum dowry.. ..he will get me married there. Oh, my God! What will happen to our marriage? What will happen? That's what l am saying.. ..take this knife and stab me in the stomach. Before my father gets me married somewhere else.. ..l better get myself stabbed by you. Till date, girls have been sacrificed for dowry.. ..today a boy will be sacrificed for dowry.. ..then my father will come to his senses. Your father will come to his senses.. ..but our marriage will be stopped. Please Honey, think of something nice. l have one idea. Your house must cost at least 1.5-2 crores. - Yes. The cars must be worth at least 40-45 lakhs. - Easily. Put in the remaining stuff and we will total 3-4 crores. Sell everything and throw it on my father's face.. ..you all come on the streets then Advocate Dhillon will be happy. Let it be. You don't want to settle down. l will leave. Listen. l have one more idea. - What? Court marriage. - Honey. - Listen to me. Listen to me. The idea of court marriage is not bad. You know how we will benefit by court marriage? lf the family agrees, we will not tell them about the court marriage. lf they don't agree then court marriage, your father will.. My father.. my father will not be able to challenge. What do you think of the idea? Actually.. The idea is not bad. Move this aside.. it may hurt someone. Oops! Sorry. Come Mrs. Honey, get down with a heavy heart. Honey, you will convince your father anyhow, isn't it? How difficult is that? Didn't l pacify you? l am a pampered child. l will pacify him. You don't worry about anything. First of all my palanquin is come on a motor-bike.. ..that too back to my mother's house. And you say don't worry. l don't like it. We have made a world record. This must the first time that the boy.. ..has brought the girl home within seconds of the marriage. After that once l take you.. ..then who will come back to your maternal house. Till l don't convince my father.. ..you Just hide it from your family that we have got married. What did you say? My son got married? He had to. Whatever the boy has done is correct. We have come to know of all your actions. Father.. ..looks like they know about the ladder. Even if they don't know, you tell them now. Traitor. Dear, what was the need to elope and do court marriage? We had agreed for the marriage. - Yes. You have agreed at six other places. - What did you say? l had agreed at six places? - Yes. Your son told me everything. You wanted to get your son married at the place you got excess dowry. You are talking about dowry? No one will give him his daughter. Father, see the situation at times. Every time you curse us. Am l cursing you? What are you doing here? The dogs can fail on a cycle but you will not. Mr. Buller. - Yes. Whatever God has given us is very less. But l don't go near dowry. Mr. Buller, the matter is closed. Now release the fixed deposit and transfer it in my name. Hear this! He has hit the bulls eye. You at least see the situation sometimes. Let me have sweets. Mr. Dhillon, everyone loves their children. By the way, if l have made any mistake.. ..then please forgive me for that. Whatever my child told me l believed it. That is our helplessness, Mr. Buller.. ..that we can't even curse our children. We Just give bad words and spare them. Go ahead.. we don't have any sister. Useless kids. Can't give me any happiness. DalJeet, show Preet her room. - Okay. Where are you going? l have given you the freedom, now l will tighten your reins. Let him come tonight. l am cursed who has given birth to such a useless son. And he has blamed me of being greedy of dowry. Father, if there was a bit of publicity of the dowry.. ..then l would have got my first independent case of my life. l would be happy to be stuck in the case.. ..than to give it to a useless lawyer like you. Very good! Go to the gallows but don't be of any use to your children. Parvati Kaur, did you hear what your son said. He will send me to the gallows and make his own future. lnstead of giving birth to these two sons.. ..you should have given birth to two stones. l could have at least kicked them. lt's a good thing you are no more. She did not go because of us. She went because of you. - l will slap you. Here comes my mother's younger son. Go and fire him. Are you done playing hopscotch? Brother has complained again. Aren't you ashamed? Playing hopscotch? To elope and get married. Even now he is looking up. Why were you so impatient? Daddy, cool, cool, cool. What will the neighbours say? - Oh, no. Speak softly. Why did you have to elope? We have lost our gifts. You are worried about the gifts. Couldn't you tell me? Am l your enemy? Would l have stopped you? Guests would have come. The gifts that we had given them, at least those would come back. Now are you going to kill your son? Get lost. Your wife is better than you. Again he is looking up. At least she speaks the truth. Oh, that means my wife lies. Now you start discussing your own wife. This is how homes break. Homes break! Oh, gosh! Stop it. Whatever had to happen has happened. Now a new daughter-in-law has come to the house. At least we should arrange a party, daddy. Hell with the party. Has he won her in a contest? He has eloped and brought her. Enough. All set. Come on. Touch the feet. Not mine. His. Enough. Now will you sit on his feet? He will sit on my feet. He is born to sit on me. Come on, let's go. He will keep blabbering. Useless kids. Can't give me any happiness. Come. Come. - Come on, Jass. Your wife is ready.. ..and your room is also decorated. Brother must have decorated it? She has dressed up your wife. Yes. You both go inside. Whose brother is he? Come on. He is yours. Come on, we don't want to hear more noises. What are you doing here? What was l doing? You were trying to do something. Should l call everybody? - Wait. How was l to know that you would be here instead of Mahi? What are you doing here with a veil on your head? What do you mean? This is my in-laws' house. ln-laws' house? Yes, l got married to Honey. You got married. l had warned him not to do so. l did not expect this from Honey. And the expectations you had when you entered this room.. ..Honey must have not expected that too. l will expose you right now. - Wait. We are already exposed. Now what will you do? l will explain everything to you. Just think that those guys who were free of tension.. ..today they have got married and are going crazy. Honey has cheated me. He is not the son of this family. l am doomed. lf my wife hears this, l will be doomed. Say the whole thing. Brother, l will be doomed. Brother, l am doomed. - You are not doomed. Honey is not a pauper. His father is an inspector in the police department. He has made bungalows by taking bribes. You will live like a queen. Now l don't believe any of you frauds. What they say is true. Lies never flourish. Ours did flourish. That's why we reached so far. But now our lies will not flourish without your help. Please. Either as a sister or a sister-in-law, help us, please. Please help us. You have returned? Wow. A person doesn't keep a watch on a beautiful girl.. ..as much as you keep a watch on me. You are talking about keeping a watch? You are such a guy, the more l keep a watch on you, the less. Have some sweets. Wow. You are such a person who takes away water from the guests. Today you are offering sweets? ls everything fine at home? First you have sweets. Okay, l will. Also tell me for what this is. - Your friend Jass has got married. What happened? You still haven't forgone your habit.. ..of picking up food from the floor and eating. No. Elders say that whenever anyone remembers you.. ..the sweet falls out of your hand. Someone must be missing me. l have heard that elders say that while making flatbreads.. ..if the dough falls from your hand, guests come to your house. Elders have said this phrase about sweets? This one l've heard for the first time. l am very smart myself. l made up this phrase. A phrase starts on some day or the other. Assume that it has started today. Henceforth, whenever a sweet falls from the hand.. ..consider that someone is missing you. People who have given you birth will not miss you. Who else must be missing you? Come on, go on. You have done a good thing to me. Your family problem is solved. So go on. People don't do this with the spare tire also. After using the spare tire, they tighten it with four bolts. And you tell me to go ahead? A spare tire is better than you. You are that precious fire cracker of 'Diwali'.. ..which never works on time.. ..and when it works, it Just bursts. Go on. As you wish. -Now where are you going that way? Now should l walk on my hands? - Go to your room upstairs. But you Just said Jass got married. So how can l go upstairs? So if Jass is married, will you leave your wife alone? First of all, l don't understand this system. Why are you so confused? A person staying with you will go crazy. l am Just confused. Eat this. l have made many people go crazy. What are you? Advocate Dhillon has not worn this black coat.. ..l hope Goldie is not around.. Just like that. Wait. l will not spare you. You idiot. l will not spare you. Listen to me. Today l will cut you into small bits. Listen to me. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Buddy, hear me out. Hello. Hello. Friend, listen to me. Friends normally cut a cake on their friend's marriage. And you are trying to cut your friend. l will cut my friend. Listen to me. Buddy, listen to me. l did not know she would come here. You have married her, telling her that you are the son of this family. lf she does not come here, where else will she go? l will cut you into pieces. Buddy, listen to me. Listen to me. You are already in a mess. You will go to prison, l tell you. You have given me two wives. What worse can happen to me? Buddy, why are you getting worried? Don't worry. We will find a solution to this problem. l get angry at your actions. And l feel like laughing at your solutions. l have already found a solution. What solution have you found? l have told Preet that you are not the son of this family. Then you might as well cut me into pieces. Don't do drama. l have pacified Preet. Hey, she is my wife. How did you pacify her? l have pacified her for your sake. Now go down the ladder and go straight into my bedroom. Yes! Listen, why should l go to your bedroom? Preet is waiting for you there. The girl for whom you used to get down the ladder and go home.. ..now you will go straight to my bedroom for that same girl. For a whole one month, it will go on like this. Yes! You are great, my friend. But how will l repay your favour, Jass. Don't be my friend in my next life. lt's good that you are in a mess. This ladder is here again? Now Jass is also married. Leaving his wife alone, is he addicted to stealing things? l feel this case is getting complicated. l will have to check it out. Advocate Dhillon does not wear a black coat Just like that. He wears it to hide his black deeds. Very good. Very good. Climb on. l am holding. Go on. Son.. have some shame. Before we are defamed in the whole neighbourhood.. ..l will fetch an axe and cut off the ladder. Son, what is the fault of this lifeless thing? And you are misunderstanding. - Okay, you explain to me. Everyday you bring the ladder here. What are you trying to do? What nonsense are you talking? Because of your deeds, my mother is no more. Thank God! She saw you riding a horse once and is no more. Otherwise she would see these actions of yours and die once more. ldiot. Can't you talk nonsense softly? You have defamed me in front of the dead. Now you are screaming and defaming me in front of the neighbours. What do the neighbours know? As soon as the moon rises, you climb the ladder... ...and wonder what you are up to. ldiot. You are screaming like a toy who has been winded up. Give me a chance to speak also. - Go ahead. l have not climbed the ladder to do something wrong. Before defaming me, look at the colour of your father's beard. What do l look it? ln the morning, you will colour it black again. Your sons have been married. Why are you doing such deeds? l do these deeds in the house. l don't go outside and do them. That day is also not too far. But listen to me carefully. Henceforth, if l see you anywhere near this ladder.. ..l will collect the whole neighbourhood here. Then you know how the neighbours are. They will bring you down the ladder and put you up somewhere else. Useless kids. Can't give me any happiness. Come on. - l am leaving. You do the needful. Parvati Kaur, did you hear? Your useless sons are bent on getting me on to a donkey. And l am arranging a party for them. l will dress up as a doll. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. l will dress up as a doll. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. l will dress up as a doll. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. You are standing like a flame in front of us. Burn your lovers. Burn. Burn. Burn. l will dress up as a doll.

Keep watching. l dance so well. Every tantrum of mine is worth millions. Worth millions. l have brought a black hair extension for you. Keep it close to you. Close to you. Close to you. l will dress up as a doll. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. l will dress up as a doll. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. You are as beautiful as a flower. Don't ever forget the moments of love. ln this season. You are as beautiful as a flower. Don't ever forget the moments of love. ln this season. Swing these lovers on the swings of love. Swing them. Swing them. Swing them. l will dress up as a doll. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Burn your lovers. Burn. Burn. Burn. l will dress up as a doll. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Burn your lovers. Burn. Burn. Burn. We really enJoyed. - Yes. Our Job is done. Brother-in-law? The food was very tasty, wasn't it? - Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law. We have heard that to sell their goods.. ..salesmen call women sister. These people have now started calling men brother-in-law. Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law, where are you looking? l'm calling you since such a long time. Who are you? Brother-in-law, you don't recognise me? l'm TaJi, your brother-in-law. Whose brother-in-law? Brother, you are mistaken. Mistaken? You got married to my sister in the court. Hey, Dhillon has been practising law since 20 years. How does this mean court marriage? Sorry, sorry. l made the sign of the nuptial rounds. Brother-in-law, you tell them. Father, he's right. The sign was wrong. Not the sign, tell them that you are my brother-in-law. Father.. - Make him your brother-in-law later. First tell me, is this girl your sister? - No. This is my enemy Buller's daughter. Preet, do you know who he is? - Yes. Yes? - Yes, yes. He's a crazy man from our village. He beats up people. l will beat you right now. What are you doing with him? - Hey. What are you doing with him? - She is his wife. His wife is my sister. You don't know how to make signs. How will you find a proper brother-in-law? Hey, crazy man. For a minute, if l consider him to be your brother-in-law.. ..that means your sister is married to him. - Yes. That means you are his wife's brother. - Absolutely. l will give you two tight slaps. Neither does your brother-in-law recognise you.. ..nor does your sister recognises you. Look at him. He is acting like a crazy man. Look at them carefully. She is his wife. Go and look for your brother-in-law somewhere else. - Yes. And here, take this Rs. 20 and go and have lunch somewhere else. Come on, let's go. - You think l'm crazy? Looking at your stomach, you look like the manager of a cattle shed. Come on. Come on. The more we talk to him, he will drive us crazy. You have destroyed the life of my sister. What are you saying, brother? Mahi, your husband has got remarried. Speak softly. What nonsense are you talking? He is lying down inside. - Lying down inside? Yes, he is not well. As soon as he returned from the shop, he went to sleep. His friend and his wife have come to see him. What happened, Mahi? Brother TaJi, when did you come? - When did l come? Mahi, l have seen him now in the market with Buller's daughter. He has got remarried. Mahi, l think l Just talk in my sleep. He sees things in his sleep. Don't create tension in my house. She has come to ask for his help. Call her right now. What is the matter, Mahi? Hello, brother. When did you come? When did you come? Everyone is after me. Now tell me.. how is he related to you? Now tell me. He? Brother Jass. - Not brother. He's a superhero who handles two women at a time. Oh, gosh! - Brother! She.. she is his second wife. She is standing here. Oh, God! What have you said? l am doomed. What happened? Who made my wife cry? Him. Who is this guy? 'Saale' (brother-in-law). No bad words. Don't give me bad words. l am not giving you bad words, brother. l am telling him our relationship, brother-in-law. He must be your brother-in-law. He is not my brother-in-law. He made my wife cry. Honey, he has defamed me. He? - Yes. You wait here a moment. He says that brother Jass and l.. You wait a moment. - Brother, l apologize. What are you looking at? Say sorry. - Say. Say sorry. - Say. Mahi, l.. - Say sorry, l have to go to another place too. Mahi, trust me. - You say sorry. Sister-in-law, he will not say sorry. l think he is very adamant. A brother brings fruits to his sister's house.. ..you have brought tension? l will not spare you all. l will not. Sister-in-law, instead of tying a 'rakhi' to such a brother.. ..you should tie him with a rope and that too with a nail. Either my sister has gone crazy, or l have gone crazy. You! l will not spare your father. l will not spare him. - Hello.. the way to go out is from here. Your father did not do a good thing to me. l will not spare you all. - Get lost. l will not spare you too. Don't fall down the stairs, you idiot. Sorry. Today the ladder is not here, looks like it is not yet time. But today l will catch the one who keeps the ladder red-handed. l will not spare him. Jass? l knew earlier, my useless son can only do such a dirty deed. Honey? You both will not be spared today. Father! l'm dead. - Are you happy falling down? Are you hurt? This is not your age to climb ladders but to climb stairs. ldiot, children normally hold the hands of their elders.... ...and make them stand up.. ..and my useless son is bent on making me climb stairs. ldiot, what are you staring at? Give a hand. To mother? - No, to father. l don't understand what world record are you trying.. ..to set by climbing the ladder all the time. Stop talking nonsense. What happened uncle? Was there a thief? Nothing. You go inside. You won't go inside! You won't go inside! Stay right there. What happened? - Nothing. From tomorrow you won't put clarified butter... ...in his lentils but put sleeping pills. ldiots, you first drive away my sleep and.. ..now you try to put me to sleep. Ask her where her husband is. He is inside. Do you have any work? Oh, l see. He is inside? lf he is inside then call him here. Call him. What happened? - Mr. Dhillon is calling you. He is standing downstairs. Come. No, it does not look good if we stand on top and talk to elders.. ..l will go downstairs and talk to him. Honey! We are in a mess. - This was sure to happen. Father, at least tell us what has happened. What should l tell my daughter-in-law about the dirty deeds of my son? Her husband and my son.. - What are you saying? Her husband and my son.. - What are you saying? Her husband and my son.. - What are you saying? ldiot, let me complete. - Okay, go ahead. Where is he? Tell us. He is coming downstairs to you. There he is. What happened? - What happened? What happened? - What happened? Being my son, you do such a dirty deed? What did l do. - What did l do? Where have you come from? From my room. - From my room. Where did you come from? From my room. - From my room. You both have not come from your rooms,... ...you have come from each other's rooms. Let the sleeping pills be, do you have poison in the house? Father is gone crazy. l will give you a tight slap, he is saying father has gone crazy! l am saying they have not cone from their own rooms.. ..they have come from each other's rooms. What are you saying? - To the extent.. that their own wives.. both of them.. yes! You have gone crazy! - You have gone crazy! Who had spoken about the poison. - Tell me. Give it to us. - Give it to us. Uncle, what rubbish are you talking? l'm saying what is going on in the house. Why are you standing quietly? Why don't you say something? l.. l.. - l.. l.. What are you blabbering? There is a limit, uncle. lf you wish that we don't stay here, tell us. We will go away. But all this? Oh my God! Reply to my wife. - Yes. Yes, reply to his wife. Give an answer. - Now speak, father. Do you have an answer for this? - Father, now speak. You have also Joined them? Useless sons. TaJi.. he took away such a precious land. l have lost my sleep and Mr. Buller you are lying down here? What has happened to you now? Nothing, sign this. What is this? - Fixed deposit. l have to give money to the agent. You don't understand? You have been avoiding till now. Today is the last date. Canada is waiting, Mr. Buller Hey you idiot of Canada. You are stinking. At least change your clothes. lf l change my clothes, assume my thinking will change. Can't you see it is written here 'Canada'. l have taken a vow, when l will land in Canada.. ..l will wave this t-shirt there like a flag. Sign this. - Give it to me. Spare me. Do it with love. Will you take your wealth with you? Who is it? Go check. You go check. l'm the younger Buller. You have shown your status, haven't you? You did not understand, did you? - What is the matter? Why have you come like this? Because l won the land case against you. You, will drag me down like this? You have fallen really low. Everyone has daughter and sisters. Will you Just stand here and bark? Tell me what is the matter. Could you only find my brother-in-law to get your daughter married to? Listen to me, l will thrash you. No, no. No quarrelling. Talk to each other with a cool mind. Headman, should we have ice to cool down? Ask him where he has got his daughter married. ln the city. Did you hear? l had told you. He has agreed. My sister is married in that house. He has ruined my sister's life. Listen to me. l will thrash him and drag him out of here. Headman, you have left your work regarding the election, and you have come with him? He is crazy. That means crazy man's sister has no honour? Let's all of us go to the city to the girl's in-laws's house.. ..there everything will be cleared. Come on. - Am l afraid? Come on. l cannot go with you all because of my neck pain. The doctor has advised me not to travel. Father, be sensible. lt is election time, don't refuse people. Will we all leave from here, or will we all Just keep talking? Come on. First release this fixed deposit. l will release the fixed deposit later first l will break your hand. Come on, come on. - Sign this please. Now brother TaJi has also spread the word in the whole village. Now we cannot even use the ladder. l say, when Mahi comes make her sit here and tell her everything. Absolutely. No buddy, in the whole world, only Mahi trusts me. She will be heartbroken. Jass, now or later you will have to break her heart. That's what l don't want to do. l thought that slowly l will make place in Mahi's heart.. ..so that this lie does not matter to her. Stop thinking about things slowly. By now that brother-in-law of yours.. ..must be bringing her father and coming here. You are talking about making place in her heart... ...we won't get any place to run. You want place to run? - Yes. We want place to run not to be killed. Your suggestions! We will finish off this story. You.. along with Preet.. who my family think is my wife.. ..run away with her. Yes. What will be the loss with that? - The benefit will be.. ldiot, people ask for benefit and you are asking for loss. lts one and the same thing. Listen, my family will think that the tenant, Honey.. ..has run away with their daughter-in-law Preet. Then l will take a stand. l will say, l don't want such a wife at home.. - Jass.. And the Honey, who has done such a dirty deed,... ...his wife who the family think is Mahi.. ..we will not keep her also in the house. We will throw her also out of the house. And after that l and Mahi... ... will take a room on rent outside somewhere and stay. After 2-3 months Mahi will trust me even more.. l will tell her everything. After that l will come home and fall at the feet of my family... ...and then 'happy ending'. Got it? l have understood the idea generally.. ..explain to me one thing.. l mean.. l have to run with her, right? Yes, buddy. That's it. We are going to do this. Not 'going to do this'. Do it right now. Okay. Take this, sir. l have done the Job. lt was Parvati's last memento. We lost that too. All right. Now there's no cause for trouble left.

Please ride as fast as you can. What worse can happen? lnstead of hitting you, people will hit my son. Ride faster, brother. Ride faster. - Okay. Go slow. l am going slowly. l love my life more than yours. Honey! What did you say? - l mean l love your life more than mine. There he is! Get hold of him! Don't be scared. l am here. l will take care of you. Here. l will put cold cloth on your forehead. l swear, if l had known that you were really unwell.. ..l would have caught some other rickshaw. Don't be scared. HarJeet. - Yes? Do you have an energy drink? l don't have an energy drink, sir. l have Chutki. How will he get up with that? He won't get up with that. He will have to be slapped a few times. Oh, no. The fuel is over. The fuel is over. What? - We are doomed. Oh, God. - Get out. Get out. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Both of them are hiding somewhere over here. Mr. Dhillon, if this proves to be a lie, then l won't spare you. Dhillon has not worn a black coat Just like that. Come inside. They must be somewhere around. Goldie. Daddy took Mahi inside. lt's better that they go inside instead of being outside. At least we won't be humiliated. Daddy, wait! Daddy! Don't pull my hand or else l will stop here. ls your hand the chain of a train that it will stop on being pulled? What's wrong with you? - What else? lf l was late by even two minutes... ...you would have taken off your black coat. Have some shame. Have some shame. You are misunderstanding. There's going to be a big problem today. God, please save me today. l won't ever lie again. First tell me why you were holding her hand. Forget all that.. try to understand. Her husband has eloped with our Preet. Shut up. Mind your language. He will mind his language. First tell him to mind his actions. Oh, my God! Why do they think l am crazy? Am l talking nonsense? Listen. The noise is coming from there. They are over there. Come. - Let's go. Come quickly. Oh, God! Where am l trapped! Mahi. - Jass. l'm sure that you can't be wrong. Mr. Dhillon was accusing you of disgusting things. Their family is full of crazy people. Come on. We'll leave the house today itself. Come on. Take care of your neck. Come on. Look. Here's your brother-in-law. Ask him where my daughter is. Mahi, l had told you. l had told you that he's having an affair with Buller's daughter. Mind your tongue! l'll slap you! Please sign first. l'll sign later. l'll hit you first. Sir, you can hit him first. We have to go to the shop. We are getting late. Let's go, Mahi. What is this? You too are having an affair with the one upstairs? You were the only one left. You also hang me. What do you mean by affair? She is his wife. His wife is his daughter. My daughter is married to Dhillon's son, not to him. He is Mr. Dhillon's son. Who brought him along? My brother-in-law! You are Buller. Me? Hit me. Leave me. Even in the court you get physical and deal with the cases? You're so strange. You misbehave with the honor of our family.. ..and we can't even hit you? Should l write on a stamp paper now that she's my real wife? For God's sake, please take this fatso away from here first. When he is Mr. Dhillon's son, how do l say that he is a tenant? l am surprised, how are you even listening to him? Beat this fatso. lf anyone even touches me, l will get sick. The cars are here. Sir must be inside. Go and ask him. He is sir's son. No, no. Don't go inside. There is a lot of problem inside. We don't have to party inside. We have to solve the matter. Come on. Let's go. - Hey! Wait a minute. You are going on extending the matter. This way l will not be able to go to Canada. Let's go inside. - Come on. - Let's go. Listen. Come here. She's my wife. No, no. l'm not saying that she's my wife. Because she's not. l can say it, as she is prettier than her. But no. When she is my wife, l will only call her my wife. He can't be trusted. You stay behind. Stand with me. Wait a minute. l will have to call Jass. Preet! - Dad! Come, my dear. Mr. Buller, your daughter was eloping with him. Who would she have eloped with, if not him? The one who's father is like that.. ..his daughter is bound to be like that. You.. Dad, Dhillon. Dhillon! Stop. Stop. Stop here. Come on. Hello. - Let's go quickly. Sir, won't you pay? Do you have any money? - l think l do. Take Rs. 20. - This is too less. We rode the rickshaw half the way. How much more do you want? This is strange. lf we start taking Rs. 20 like that, then we'll never progress. Brother, a country where an inspector is traveling by rickshaw.. ..how do you expect to progress in such a country? Come on. Let's run. Let's run. Come on. Come on. ls he your son? - Father, you have hidden this from us? Who says he's my son? - l say. He's a crazy man. You believe him? Now you say something. Who listens to me between all of you? l have been barking since one hour. Now l will only bite. ls there any sensible man around or are you all crazy? Mahi, you are sensible. You say something. Now how does it matter? You idiot. Now you put up some new drama. Mahi, you tell them he is your husband. Just please take me outside otherwise l'll go crazy. l had told you earlier there is no use of going inside. Come on. - Hey, don't hug there. Hug here. Shall l hug you? Headman, have you come to ask for votes here? Beat him up. You hold my neck, l will hold his neck. Try and hold his neck. l won't spare you. We have not held his neck yet. We are only discussing. How can you say such a thing? Stop this. Does anyone hear me? Keep quiet, everybody. - Quiet. Quiet. Why have you caught this boy? What else shall we do? He has run away with my daughter-in-law. When he had run away earlier, you did not say anything. Oh, God. l am in a mess. - One minute. Who are you? - l am the girl's father. When the father has no problem.. that has daughter has run away with someone.. ..what is your problem? l have a problem. Because his daughter is not married to him, but to him. No, no, brother. - Forget the visa, son. l.. l.. - Don't call me again. First ask the girl with whom she wants to elope. Excuse me. Whoever wants to elope with my sister can do so. First, Mr. Buller, please sign here. - Get lost. Listen to this. He has ended the whole matter. One must have such a brother. Let's leave. Everyone is easily free. Enough of this drama. First all of you tell me this. Who is my daughter married to? To him. Don't talk rubbish. He is my.. - Hey. One minute. Now if anyone speaks in between, l will shoot him. Let one person speak. Yes, you carry on. Mr. Dhillon, now accept that he is your son. Now l will beat you. He is my son. Beat me. Beat me. Uncle, are there less problems already that you are increasing them? Honey is his son. Jass, you say something. Let it be. What will we get by saying anything? Have some shame. Have some shame. People are calling your father a liar.. ..and you say you have nothing to do? What do you mean by father? You must be Honey's father. Hey, l am his father. He is my son. Oh, God. May you be doomed. You are eloping with others. Take care of your own, who is going crazy. You are going crazy. l am not Honey's wife. l am Jass's wife. Really? You will now say l am not Jass's father. Yes. His father is dead. He is not yet dead, but you see, he will die now. He will die in front of your eyes. Give me the gun. Let me kill myself. lf you want to die, go ahead. But why with my gun? The one bullet that l have shot, l have to give an account.. ..for that also to the department. How will l account for this? As if the policemen give an account of the bullets. So badly you bit me. - Daddy! Look, brother, for the sake of God.. ..tell us with a calm mind what your problem is. l will tell you only if anybody listens to me. He is my son. My useless son. She is his wife. He is my tenant. And he eloped with my daughter-in-law. Are we barking like dogs? He is your son. My daughter is married to him. She is not married to him, but to him. My sister's married to him. No. She is married to our tenant. Hey, now who is this? - Our servant. Oh, gosh. Now the servants have also started talking. You are standing quietly here? l thought you have only driven me crazy. You have driven half the world crazy. l ask you, who is your real father? Tell us, who is your real father? Useless kids. Can't give me any happiness. Do you understand anything? l don't understand anything, son. But l am enJoying a lot. Why are you looking here and there? Will you ask them and then tell us who your father is? You're my son, right? Speak up. Whose son are you? You're my son, right? No? l am doomed. l am doomed. l am going to die. l am going to die. Your father will die. Your father will die today. Will die today. Will die today. l will go crazy, Jass. l will go crazy. l will go crazy. l will go crazy. l will die. l will die. - Daddy. Will die today. - Daddy, what are you doing? You are not inJured, but you have got a lot of cobwebs on your face. Enough now. This is my father. Jass? Father, you are right. l am your useless son. Forgive me, father. l had hidden the truth from you. Not Preet, but Mahi is my wife. To attain Mahi, l told one lie. And to hide that man lies, l had to tell many more lies. Along with you, l am Mahi's culprit too. Son, you drove your father crazy. But your father, with a heavy heart, bore everything. But the one with whom you have to spend your whole life, stop her. Mahi.. Mahi. Mahi. l trusted you more than God, Jass. Was there anything lacking in my love? Why didn't you tell the truth? Mahi, l know l hurt you. But what could l have done? l fell in love with you at first sight. You wanted such a boy who had no family. That's why to attain you, l told a lie that l have no family. lf l had not lied, maybe today.. ..without you l would have been left alone. To make you my own, my method may have been wrong. But my intention wasn't wrong. l love you very much. Before the marriage, l wanted to tell you the whole truth. But the marriage took place so fast.. ..that l did not get a chance to tell you anything. How do l explain to you? lt was a secret. l had Just attained you, so l was scared. l loved you so much that l couldn't tolerate it. Couldn't tolerate it. lt was a small thing, but l couldn't say it. l'll die. l'll die. l'll die. l'm sorry, Mahi. l was in love with you. Even if you had told me the truth,... ... there would be nothing lacking in my love. l love you equally even today as much as l did yesterday. Forgive me. But you won't lie to me again. What if l do? Jass. You did not listen to me, right? You eloped and got married. Daddy, you had scared me that.. ..l will beat you all up in the police station. So l got scared and eloped. l will beat now also.. you. When we give her gifts. Daddy, we will make a deal. - What? You don't beat us, by next year, we will give you a grandson. Then l also have a condition. What? The son should be like you. Thank you, dad. You should also know what a useless son is like. l have Just realised today that advocate Dhillon has worn.. ..this black coat Just like that. Look, why have you worn Just like that? Father, you deserved it, that's why you have worn it. - Absolutely. My good sons, full of fun and frolic. Okay, tell me, Mahi. Why did you get so angry? Father was in my life, not another woman. No girls look at us. No one remains with us. No girls look at us. No one remains with us. No girls look at us. No one remains with us. What is the reason for this? Hey, straighten the camera. No girls look at us. No one remains with us. No girls look at us. No one remains with us. No girls look at us. No one remains with us. No girls look at us. No one remains with us. What is the reason for this? He is crazy. He is crazy. What do we do? The heart is like that. l had heard of wingless birds. This is what l had heard. Those ride on a cycle on Sunday and Monday. But.. but.. but.. My buddy is great. Ours is crazy. Ours is crazy. But what do l do? My friend is great. Whenever l go out on my scooter, l take someone else's shades. l am in love, but where should l bring all this? That.. that.. that.. that the thorn is stuck. He is crazy. He is crazy. But what do l do? My friend is great. Your cheeks look like a red tomato. Don't apply more makeup. She says l Just apply powder. l make boys like you dance to my tunes. And.. and.. and.. Even then you're not appealing. Ours is crazy. Ours is crazy. But what do l do? My friend is great. But what do l do? My friend is great.
