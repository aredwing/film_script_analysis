That's why she's haunting the place now. A guy saw her in his locker. But it was only her head. She is visiting him over and over again. I'm getting scared, when I talk about it. Don't worry about me mom. I'll be back soon. Bye. See you soon. Phii May! Phhii May, What is it? Don't you recognize me? What's all that about? Go clean yourself. Or someone will get a heart attack because of you! Can you borrow me some soap? Are you still here? Turn off the lights when you go! Yes. - Those kids. Nothing but trouble. I don't know how you were raised but here we respect our elders. You have to do what we tell you to do. You think you're ready for college? You have no idea! You can't anything! Don't you have anything nice to say? We're humans, not animals. We have feelings. If you don't like it, go home! Go home to mommy she won't yell at you. Don't act so big! How cute. We have rules here. You have to follow them! Eat up. Eat up! Chew! That's how spiders move, they play, and they jump... The chicken is cooked. Soon it will be pierced. Pierce it from the left, pierce it from the right. The chicken is cooked... Oh, my little darling... I will never go far away from you. I love you with an endless love. Your Guardian Angel will be guarded by mine. I'll take care of him and protect him with my life. May your pain go away my darling. This is outrageous! What is? Those implementation things. They go way to far. Look at what they do with the freshmen. Just cruel! It's only jokes. Don't worry about it. - I don't want that you go along. Starting the college is enough why drive out to the country? Do you really have to go sweetie? I'm not a kid anymore. All my friends go. I have to. Look at your skirt, it's way to short! And the blouse is to tight. Stop complaining! I have to go. - Wait! Do you have your medicine? I got everything with me. Take care my child, I always worry so much. Yes mom, I'm going now. - Yes. Okay. Go already darling. Bye. First Semester! Did you know, that someone, in secrecy has a crush on you, follows you, watches you, and you even encouter each day? First Semester! Do you know, who it is, who admires you so much? Driver, don't try to follow, they're obviously crazy! Hello. How cute! Does he have a name too? - I am Jonathon. So cute and such a ugly name? I'll give him a new name. - Would you like to? How about "Moon Ping"? Thanks, my name is quite okay. Don't you like it? And... how about "Teun Dong"? That fits to the distracted way you look. Mom? Hello? Look. A little doggy! Oh, he's so cute! Do you know it's name? Teun Dong! First Semester Excursion Easy there, no panic! We're there. Hey, Yezariel. Where you're going? Comeon! Move for fucks sake! We're having a excursion. First semester excursion? - Exactly. - The forest is closed off. That's impossible! We drove so far! - It's raining. The path is to slippery. What if you're having a crash? I don't take any responsibility for that. It's closed off! And where should we sleep? One moment. Hey you! I'm talking to you! What are we gonna do now? - What next? Goddamn! Such an asshole! Eat! Aren't you hungry? I have nothing to drink. - I'm gonna get you something. - It's okay I'll go. Thank you. What would you like to drink, Jonathan? - Anything. - Okay, I'll be right back. This is so boring! Those noodles are terrible. awm, try them. - I could vomit! We can't go in. And it's raining. What are we gonna do now? Mai! I did want to go to the island, but you were all against it. Bawmp is right. On the Island everything would've been good. It's your fault! I did want to go to a spooky place. Don't you like spooky places? We're not in the kindergarden here! Something is not right here. Everything is going wrong in some way. So, what's your plan? - Yes, what? We've made it hard for the freshmen. We're going on the Island Toey. You can do whatever you want. I'll think about it. Do you want to go into the forest? Yes, Why? - I'd like to come along. We can't get in. The guard won't let us pass. Don't take the normal route then. There's another one. An old street, that is not in use anymore. I'll show it to you. - That one leads into the forest? Yes. - There you got it. What so you want to do now? We've come this far. - Hey! The guard forbid it! Are you guys crazy? Who asked you? If you don't like it go home! If you lead them into the forest, and something happens it's your fault. Stay out of this. - Who do you think you are? The commander? - I've brought you here. If you don't like it, get lost! - Mai! I know what you're up to. You want to screw the girls! - Stop it you two! Stop it! Phii May, nobody forces you to come along. If you're scared go home, and take the others with you! Hey, wait. What is it? I'm going home. - Oh, comeon,Phii May. We came together and we continue together. It's not funny anymore. Don't worry, it was fun till now wasn't it? She's laughing. - No, I'm going! Aww, comeon! Let's stay together,Phii May. Very funny, to pull on my purse! If you're nice to me. - We'll be good! What's that? A ghost gate. - What is it for? The Village ppl believe that all visitors have to go through that gate first. Stop the bus! Why do we stop? - Yes... I am scared. I want to give the ghosts of the forest their tribute. What's wrong about that? What ghosts? I am the chief ghost here! What are you scared about? You're so superstitious! We all should go through the gate. That's a waste of time. I don't know... What is that? - I don't know. That was nothing. Just a branch. Comeon, let's go. We've wasted enough time already. Is it gonna hold? Sure, it even holds heavy goods transporters. A little bus like this is no problem. The bridge is so small. If you're scared, I'll go have a look. Let's drive. What could happen anyway? Something wrong? Comeon! It's safe. Drive! Well... I'll go see in the back. Good excuse, Awm! You fucking pussy! Comeon. Go, we're stopping to often. Take my hand, Phii May, take a grip! Phii May jump! - No, I won't. Jump! Bawmp? Bawmp! Hang in there. Together we'll do it! Where are all the others? they're coming any moment to help us. Are you okay Phii May? I'm fine. So, why are you crying? Don't think about it, Bawmp, think about nothing. Hang in there. They'll save us. Bawmp! Wake up! Get up and talk to me! Can you hear me? Bawmp! Wake up, Bawmp! Don't leave me alone! Help! Help! Hey, Phii May... where is Bawmp? Bawmp? Bawmp is dead. I've let him die. I've let him die! 'tis ok. Why are the Ghosts doing this to us? Why are you killing us? Please spare our lives! I'm so sorry. Pawk! Hey,Mew! Mew, stop it! Let me! - No, let him! Calm down Mew! Why are you blaming me? It's that idiots fault!
