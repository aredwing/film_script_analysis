HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN A GOOD, CLOSE LOOK AT WHAT THE ANT IS ALL ABOUT? LIKE THESE ATTA CEPHALOTES. ONE OF THE 15,000 DIFFEREN SPECIES INHABITING OUR PLANET. THIS ONE CULTIVATES CROPS OF FUNGUS FOR FOOD. OTHERS HERD APHIDS, JUST AS MAN HERDS CATTLE. AND WHAT ABOUT THE WARRIORS? THE BUILDERS OF BRIDGES, ROADS, TUNNELS? FRIGHTENING, ISN'T IT, THA A CREATURE AS SMALL AS AN AN IS ABLE TO HAVE A FAIR CLAIM TO RANK NEXT TO MAN IN THE SCALE OF INTELLIGENCE? THEY HAVE A SOPHISTICATED COMMUNICATION SYSTEM. SPECIFIC MESSAGES ARE TRANSMITTED FROM ONE ANT TO ANOTHER THROUGH THE USE OF A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE CALLED PHEROMONES. IT CAUSES AN OBLIGATORY RESPONSE. DID YOU HEAR THAT? OBLIGATORY. PHEROMONES GIVE AN ORDER THAT CANNOT BE DISOBEYED. IT'S A MIND-BENDING SUBSTANCE THAT FORCES OBEDIENCE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT. THAT'S BUSINESS BETTER LEFT TO THE ANTS. Got it? What took you so long? I stopped to get some extra liquor. You should've let me know. I didn't know I was supposed to be on call. You're always supposed to be on call. Sorry, Ms. Fryser. That's all right, sweetheart. You're so terrific in the sack that it almost justifies the excessive salary that I have to pay you. By the way, captain... Try and give us the smoothest possible trip, will you? We don't want any of our prospective buyers getting seasick. Yes, ma'am. Sick people do not buy property. I'll cut between the waves. You do that. I'm sure you remember, by the way, that I'm paying you damn good money to rent this boat, captain. I'm sure that if I forget, you'll remind me. Oh, well, it looks like our guests are finally arriving. Sure a nice boat, isn't it? We went on a bigger one to Mexico that time. Yeah, but we paid for that trip. Two-bit cruise down the coast to look at overpriced swampland. You always said you wanted a home on the ocean. Yeah, I said a lot of things. You coming? Yeah, yeah, all right. You win. We'll go for a boat ride. Here's a $10. Keep the change. But, lady, the fare's $9.80. don't mention it. What are you doing? The letter said everything was free. I'm writing down all our expenses so we can be reimbursed. Umm... Before I board your ship, may I ask you a question? Yes, ma'am. I just want to make certain that I'm under no obligation to buy any of your property, in case I change my mind. It's not my property, lady. I just get you there and get you back. Thank you. Let's get this circus on the road. Hi. Are you Ms. Ellis? Yes. I'm Marilyn Fryser, I'm the president of Dreamland Shores. Come and meet some people. This is Mr. and Mrs. Lawson. Hello. And this is Larry Graham. I think we have everybody on-board now. Think that'll please the bitch? Ever see anything that did? What a rip-off. She'll bring a boatload of slobs down here and convince them it's paradise. It wouldn't be so bad around here if it was close to something. A road, a town, anything. What about diamond Springs? Sure, that's practically next door. All you do is walk 2 miles to the river and swim upstream another 10. You ought to read the contract she makes them sign. The jerks that buy this swampland can't even sell it for 2 years. Dreamland shores won't be here in 2 years. Why don't you try some of the meatballs over there? They are really tasty. Are you ladies having a good time? Lovely. Just marvelous, thank you. It'd be wonderful. Everything is so fresh. It's unbelievable. Everything all right here? It's great. You won't believe how difficult it was for me to convince Larry to come this weekend. Mr. Thompson? Yes. Have you taken some good pictures? I think I have some dandies. Excuse me. Where are those 2 guys that you hired? I suppose they finished their work and they left. Left? Well, you can tell them that they're fired. Speaking of that, why don't you try a little of that old-world charm that you're so famous for on our guests? I'm not running a charity organization. I've always wanted to live near the water. It's beautiful here, isn't it? Yes, it is lovely. How are you doing? Fine. Charlie, right? Right. Good, Charlie. What are you doing? Trying to figure out what everybody's doing here? Here to buy land. What else? Not everyone. Our average is 1 out of 3 people come along just for the ride. You should be more careful who you invite. We sure would like to, but we get stuck with that statistic no matter what. What about this group? Think you can figure out who'll be the buyers and who aren't? Not exactly. But I think I've got you figured out. Tell me. Not only could you not afford a lot, but I think you'd have a hell of a time swinging for the boat ride. Am I right? Cheers. Excuse me. Have you had enough? Enough what? Party bullshit. I know what you mean. Why don't we take a look around? See if this place is for real. I don't think your wife would like that. Uh, we have different interests. I'm sure you do. How about it? Yes, Mr. Stratton is the vice president of international management consultants. I've worked for him about 20 years. His personal executive secretary, you understand. It's quite a responsibility. Cheap scotch. I think its all a come-on. So what? It's free, isn't it? That's what velma and I like the most. That's a long time to be with one company. Not when you consider all the benefits that can accrue... Gifts, bonuses, retirement pension. No wonder you're looking into land investments. I wouldn't say that I'm exactly looking for investments. Now, don't you worry. Nobody is going to hustle you into buying anything. Dreamland Shores sells itself. Mmph! That's not what we came out here for. Come on. I must be crazy or something. I just met you an hour ago and here I am out in the woods playing hot fingers. Loosen up. Let me go! Look, I just got out of one married man. Not with me. It'll be one of the big disappointments in my life. Where you going? Let go! Come on. You know what it's all about, baby. Let me go, you son of a bitch! Relax, relax. That's it. I just want to get to know you, that's all. Ok. We're gonna be good friends. Aah! Shit! Ohh! Ohh! Excuse me. I was going to ask you if you'd like to join the entertainment, but I see you found your own. Yeah, we were just looking around. Yeah, we were just looking around. If you're looking for the party, it's right down there. I'm not much for parties. Besides, I want to talk to you. It's Dan, isn't it? What do you want to talk about? Here. This place. Dreamland shores. Look, lady, I told you, I'm just the boat driver. I get you here and I get you back. I don't sell the land, all right? Exactly, so you shouldn't care one way or another. I don't. I don't give a damn. You see, I want to open a small business. Maybe an agency for domestic help. But it's going to take all the savings I've got, so I've got to make certain that I make the best investment possible. I don't have any opinions about that. Well, but you'd be honest with me. Like, this land they're trying to sell us, is it a good thing? Or not? Lady, if you want advice, would you ask somebody else, please? I just had a pretty rough time of it myself. And I guess if I weren't so sick of the whole routine, I'd probably be doing what you're doing right now. I beg your pardon? All this self-pity, "nobody-gives-a-damn" attitude. What? The booze. Right. You know, umm when I met you on the boat, I didn't like you very much. That's not exactly a surprise. I don't know. I guess I thought you were one of those macho, phony types, the kind whose brains fall out every time he unzips his fly. Say, what is this, group therapy? Maybe. I can't afford to make a mistake, that's all. I lied to them back there before. I told them I had a good job, been working for the same man for 20 years. The truth of it is, he fired me. All I've got is severance pay and references. I've got a job that pays $30,000 a year, I own a 2-bedroom condominium, I've got a $10,000 sports car, I've got a wife and I got a 4-year-old kid who thinks I'm god. How's that? That's terrific. That's fabulous. Look, I was just trying to tell you that I changed my mind about not liking you. That's all. Forget it. I'm a bad investment. And why do you say that? Because the... $30,000-a-year job went in the toilet last year. And the sports car needs an overhaul. And my wife is an ex-wife, who's suing me for back support. My kid won't even talk to me on the phone. What about your condominium? Plastic, like everything else. Shall we? Ok. If it was my money and I was going to buy this land, first, I'd make sure they struck oil on it, and then I'd still think twice. Does that answer your question? Ok. Dan. You got a button off your shirt. If you got time, I always carry a needle and thread. I don't need any buttons. This building here is gonna be torn down. And the dreamland shores beach club is gonna be constructed in its place. It'll be the most beautiful and modern club imaginable, with every possible convenience. If we all get into the tram, now, where Charlie is, we'll be off on our little tour. Here we go. NOW, DON'T FORGET, IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING, JUST SHOUT THEM OUT. WE'RE VERY INFORMAL HERE AND THIS TOUR IS STRICTLY FOR YOUR PLEASURE. I THINK ALL OF YOU BOATING ENTHUSIASTS WILL BE INTERESTED IN THESE PRESENTLY-AVAILABLE LOTS, WHICH, AS YOU CAN SEE, ARE CONVENIENTLY LOCATED RIGHT NEXT TO THE MARINA. ALL OF THE HOUSE LOTS YOU SEE HERE WILL BE SOLD ON A FIRS COME, FIRST SERVED BASIS. IF YOU SEE A LOT THAT APPEALS TO YOU, JUST TELL CHARLIE OR ME AND WE'LL GIVE YOU FIRST REFUSAL. Larry, what do you think? It's not what I think, it's what daddy thinks, isn't it? Honey, you know my father only wants to help us... Both of us. He'd help us a lot more if he'd leave us alone. Then maybe he'd be satisfied with what I could give you. YOU WILL NOTICE THAT WE HAVE CAREFULLY PRESERVED THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF DREAMLAND SHORES. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE LONG WALKS INTO THESE SECLUDED AREAS. BIRDS AND BUTTERFLIES AND FRAGRANT FLOWERS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GOLF ENTHUSIASTS, YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO BE SITUATED OVERLOOKING THE 18-HOLE GOLF COURSE, WHICH WILL SOON BE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. AFTER WE STOP AT OUR PICNIC AREA FOR REFRESHMENTS, WE'LL GO ON AND LOOK AT SOME OF THE INLAND PROPERTIES. HERE WE ARE. Be careful getting out, now. Now, if we're really lucky, we may get some glimpses of some of the fascinating wildlife that's in this area. Do you know there are 100 different kinds of birds here? There are? Yes. I've seen over 50 myself. Charlie? You want to help me with the sandwiches, darling? Would you like a plate? Thank you. It almost looks like those romantic places you used to see in old movies. What does your husband think about the idea? He's not very interested. Oh, what a shame. But your husband seems to be. Then I took one of those long, slow looks. You know the kind you take on a rainy weekend when he's home playing goody-goody family man? I got up one day, got dressed and told the bastard to go back to his wife. You know something? From then on, it was just like a breath of fresh air. I cashed in my fur coat and all the other little knick-knacks and decided to buy myself a piece of something really legitimate... Like a house. I could go to bed when I wanted to go to bed. That's why I'm here. Although, you know, I really don't know what's so great about owning a house. Thomas, what are you doing? Looking, just looking. You're trying to find fault, aren't you? You don't trust anybody. Most people are dishonest. Lets get back to the others. In a minute, in a minute. Look at this, Mary! It's a water pipe! It isn't even connected! It's a fraud, just like I said. These people are dishonest. This is a fraud! Trust people? I tell you, you can't trust anybody, Mary. You can't trust anybody. I hope you've learned your lesson. Look! What's that sound? Who cares? I found what I was looking for. Listen, Thomas, it's all around us. Mary, will you leave... Oh, my god. Run, Mary, run! Help, Mary, help! Help, Mary, help me! Ahh! Oh, my god! OVER THERE, ABOUT 50 YARDS, WILL BE OUR COMMUNITY RECREATION CENTER. IT WILL HAVE A COMPLETE WORKSHOP AND HOBBY ROOM. THERE WILL BE A THEATER, A BOWLING ALLEY, POOL TABLES, SAUNAS, EVERY CONVENIENCE. The Lawsons. Where are the Lawsons? They ducked out back at the picnic area. Why didn't you say something? After listening to you on that bullhorn for 2 hours, I was ready to duck out myself. Keep moving, Charlie. There's a lot more to see, everybody. What's that noise? Seems to be coming from over there. It's nothing to worry about. It's probably some of our pumping equipment. Marilyn, there's no pump. We'd better get back to that boat. Shut up. There's nothing to worry about, everybody. WHEN YOU COMPARE ALL THE BENEFITS OF DREAMLAND SHORES TO OTHER LAND INVESTMENTS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN, I'M CERTAIN YOU WILL REALIZE WHAT A WONDERFUL VALUE WE HAVE HERE. Oh, my god! Look! That's Pete, one of our workers. My god! What happened? Take it easy. Holy Jesus. Hey, we'd better go look for the Lawsons. Who'll go with me? Larry? No, I'm not going out there. No, not me. I'm an old man. We only came because it was free. We take these tours all the time. But nothing ever happened like this before. It's ok, Harry. Joe, I'll go with you. All right. We'll meet you back at the boat. Mr. Lawson! Mr. Lawson! Joe. Oh, my god. Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Oh, my god. What the hell are they? That's my boat. Dan! Oh, my god. Let's pick them up at the beach! Get up! Ahh! Aahh! We're never gonna get out of here. Why is this happening? Larry. I can't believe this. God. They don't like fire. That's for sure. All we have to do is keep this damn fire going. They just couldn't be. Joe? Ants. Why don't we go into the old beach house? We'll be safe inside there. Without that fire, those things would be inside with us in 2 minutes. Goddammit, why do you shoot down everything that I say? You never did like working for me just because I'm a woman. They're waiting. They're out there waiting until the fire dies. Can't you hear them? Where did they come from? How the hell did they get that size? What are you thinking? I'm thinking of a way out. All we wanted was to enjoy what was left of our life. Is that bad? Hey, how about some candy? It's good. It'll make you feel better. Come on. It's yours if you want it. Better get some more wood for that fire. You're not gonna need any wood. Charlie? Yeah? The tent and the workers... I didn't bring them. How did they get here? A river north of here about 2 miles. We've a got boat on that river, a small boat! You expect us to walk 2 miles through that jungle? Oh no, we're gonna stay right here until help comes! When the hell is that gonna be, Marilyn? Look, as soon as they know that we're missing, they'll send a search party! I am not gonna leave dreamland shores! You can stay here and be buried on dreamland shores. That fire goes out, I'm gonna be someplace else. Well, do you want to try for the river or not? It's unanimous, Joe. We're all too scared to vote. No! No, they'll kill us.! Larry, why don't you just wait for them here! Charlie, we're not leaving! I'm gonna stay here and you're gonna stay with me. We'll go into the beach house. You're crazy, Marilyn! We've gotta go! Marilyn! Marilyn! Oh! Aah! Ahh! Keep going! Come on. Oh, god! Keep going. The beach house is full of them! Dozens of giant ants! Hurry up. Come on, hurry up. There! I can't keep up! Let's go this way. Careful, now. don't stumble. Don't worry, sweetie, we'll be safe in there. Larry! Ahh! What? Larry, wait! Oh! My ankle! Agh! Larry! Oh, please, don't leave me! Larry! Come on. Let's go. Come on! Charlie! Charlie! Oh, god! Oh, god, no, please! Go! The rain stopped. It's a good omen. All right? There it is. There's the boat. Joe! We're coming through. We lost the old couple. Hang on. What about Christine? No, she didn't make it. Come on. I'm not going with you. Get in the boat. Charlie's dead. I want to stay with him. Get in the goddamn boat! Ok, Joe, let's go. Get your fingers out of the way. Move them. You're working for me, remember? I'm still in charge here. Would you like to row? Very funny. See? I told you we'd be safe. They're gone now. So quiet. God, why is it so quiet? We got away from them. We left them all back there. We did, didn't we? Joe? Dan? I don't know. Thank god we're safe. Charlie never got away from them. We'll never get away from them. This has turned out to be one hell of a free vacation. I loved Christine, you know. I hope that nice old couple got away. What were their names? Harry and velma. I wish I hadn't seen Charlie die like that. What was I supposed to do? She ran off. I turned around and she was gone. I went to look for her. Nobody's blaming you, Larry. We're not saying it's your fault. You think I saw the ants kill her, don't you? Go ahead and say it! Go on! Why would we think that? Mr. Stratton always liked a cup of nice hot tea at the end of a hard day, with a slice of orange peel. I took very good care of him. I started there as a file clerk. And after all those years, do you know how they gave me my notice of termination? It was a little piece of paper... A memo. "Dear Ms. Ellis, "this is to inform you "that your services are no longer required "and your employment is hereby terminated. You will receive the usual severance pay, as is customary with this firm. Mr. Stratton didn't even sign it. I've never done anything like this, never taken any chances, never done anything dangerous. It's not fair that this should happen to me. Oh, Larry, if it's any consolation, none of us are enjoying this boat ride anymore than you are. Main part of the river looks like it comes from that way. It's to the left. We should go left. I'm glad somebody's sure. Either way, just as long as we keep moving. It's my life, goddammit! Go left! Congratulations, Larry. You're also a dynamite navigator. Go to hell. Shut up, you two. Why don't you all shut up? We can get around it. If you say so, Larry. You're the navigator. Can you move it? Why don't we walk it around? I don't want to portage it. How can we get past that? Dan! Dan! Get them away! Dan! Larry, I'm... I'm sorry about the navigator crack, if it matters. It doesn't. Ok. Forget it. We're all on edge. We say things we don't mean. Yeah, well, tell that bitch, don't tell me. Look out! Help me! Help me! God help me! We'll be fine along the beach. Watch that tree! Ok. Oh! Let's continue upstream. We'll just follow the river. Hold it! What? What is it? Ahh... Nothing. Thought I heard something. Listen! Wait a minute. I told you that this river didn't lead anywhere. You should have listened to me, dammit! I don't care what the rest of you do. I am gonna go in this direction! Marilyn! Marilyn! Ahh! It's all right. What do we do now? Obviously, they can kill us any time they want to. They just don't seem to want to right now. Why not? Can't you tell? What do you mean? I mean, they don't want us to go that way and they don't want us to go back the way we came. That only leaves one way... upstream. Oh, my god! They're herding us like cattle! Ahh! God, where'd they come from? Let's get the hell out of here. Oh, my god! It's civilization! Where are we? Is there a town near here? You folks look like you've been out in that storm all night. It wasn't the storm that bothered us. There's a real horror show coming upriver behind us. Giant ants, big as you are. They've already killed killed some people. Phoebe will call the sheriff. Have you seen them? Phoebe! Call the sheriff! Phoebe's a very good wife. Giant ants. That's hard to believe. Never thought I'd live to see the day. What are you gonna do, sheriff? Well... First thing, I'm gonna get you people situated. Then I'll get some deputies and go back to the river and start searching. I told you, those things are vicious as hell. A couple of deputies won't do you much good. I got a whole town if I need it. I don't know how many of them are out there. don't worry about it. Any ants come this way, we'll take care of them. The sugar refinery. On the way back, I better alert them. They're so close to the river. You folks don't have to worry anymore. All you have to do is rest, unwind and we'll get you cleaned up. I radioed one of my deputies to make arrangements. I hope this place is nice enough for you folk. That's very kind of you, sheriff. Sheriff, I'd like to make a phone call. My friend at the state capital could get help here fast. Sure, go ahead. What I really want to do is go home. As soon as we get the main highway open, you can all be on your way. don't tell me your problems, Harrison, and I won't tell you mine. I want that shipment of sugar in my town by day after tomorrow or you can forget it. Mayor, you got some customers here. Be with you in a minute. Long-distance phone. Yeah, I'd like to place a person-to-person call to Mr. John Amstead in the state attorney's office at the capital. Any more problems, you call me at once, you hear? Anson Parker. He owns the motel. He's also our mayor. Very wealthy. don't take 3 days to drive those rigs from your place to mine. It's a lousy 800 miles. Tell the men to drive all night if they have to. Remember that sugar refinery we passed on our way here? Something funny. Funny? Yeah. When we were back at that old couple's house, the woman said something to me that just didn't make sense, that's all. What did she say? She said, "whatever you do, don't let them take you to the sugar refinery." Isn't that crazy? There's no way to get a call through? Dammit, don't you have some emergency lines? It's none of your business what I'm doing with the sugar. Our refinery is turning out all it can, full blast and we need more. Ok. Fine. Bye-bye. Sorry. A little business problem. You must have come up from dreamland shores. How did you know we came from dreamland shores? Fix these people up with something real nice, mayor. The best in the house. Y'all just sign the register, please? I guess I've done all that I can. I'll go back to the river and look for... What you were talking about. A problem, sheriff? I'll tell you later when I've more time. If I find anything, I'm gonna let you know. You'll find something. You know, I think you're right. Is there any place around here I can rent a car? A couple of blocks up the street. Good, we're gonna want to get home. Why don't you guys get some rest for a while? I'll sleep to that. All I need is a hot bath. If you fellows have any problems, just tell them to call me. Yeah, we'll do that. Thanks. Finish your phone call? No, all the lines are down because of the storm. That's odd, the mayor was talking long-distance. How do you suppose they got his call through? Driver's license? Yes, we need it to verify that you're a qualified driver. I lost it. What about you? I don't have anything. Look, Miss, the mayor said if we had any trouble, you could call him. Well, I will need a name. You didn't lose that, did you? Joseph morrison. And your local address, Mr. morrison? We don't have a local address, just the motel where we're staying. I see. Look honey, will you just call the mayor and get us a car? Well, I'm supposed to follow the rules. Couldn't you bend the rules a little bit? Maybe I can process the application a different way. Right. Can you come back later? How much later? Tomorrow. Tomorrow? It's the best I can do. That's the only car rental agency in town. That son of a bitch lied to us. Said they were going downriver and look for the ants. Let's go. Careful. Didn't see us. I hope that's the last we see of that place. What are you looking for? I'm looking for a gun. Not that we'd be that lucky. THIS HIPPIE LIFE and maps of Florida and some road flares. Well, at least we're set if the car breaks down. Oh, shit. God. Get down, everybody. Get them! don't let them get away! Hey, don't shoot. We're peaceful, honest to god. All right? Go on. All right. Can't you guys take a joke? Take it easy. Run! Dan! Go! Run! No, don't fire! We have enough here to begin with. Pick him up. We have a chance if we can get to the river and find a boat and get help for the others. Just keep moving. There's enough sugar there to feed an army and they turn out that much every day. Keep moving! Ow! Ahh! Please, there's nothing to fear, nothing. Come along. Nothing to fear. Please, come on. Isn't she beautiful? She's fantastic. She needs us. That's why it has to be this way, why we must obey. We have no choice. She makes us do it. At first, uh, people don't understand. They must be forced into submission. After their indoctrination, they realize that the ants only want us to take care of them and to feed them. Every week, the people must be brought back here to be indoctrinated again. She's the only one that can do it. She's the queen ant. You see how easy it is. Once you feel her energy, then you'll understand that we can all work together. We can all do what the ants want us to. Work for them, feed them. That's the way it should be, for they are superior. Since you are our guests, won't you take the front of the line, please? No! Keep your hands off me, you son of a bitch! Joe! Put them here with the others. - Stop it! - Quiet down! No! No! Please! No, let me go! Please! Let me out of here. don't you see? We mustn't disobey them. We must take care of them and we must help them. Keep the line moving. Get him out of there! You can't! Take the women down to the river! Go on! Get the hell out of here! Uh. Joe! Oh, god! Joe! Where is he? Where is he? No! Get in the boat. Get her in the boat! Joe! Dan! Joe!
