In fact, I myself destroyed one of them. Madam, this car is already fixed. Somebody put a gum in the carburetor. You're fired! Can you deal with that later? The hospital is here. Hop in. My mom almost went crazy because of Grandma Amparo... my father's monster mom. I'm the doctor. - Doc, I'm about to give birth! - Bring out the mother! Help me, because according to the ultrasound, I am bearing four children. Of course I know that. I'm a doctor. - Yes! - And who do you want to call? Ghostbusters! You're crazy! Push! It's a girl. - There's another one. - What? Another one? Wait. It's coming! Push! It's a boy! It's a boy... My son... My son... This is mine! This is Basilio's brother! This is Crispin! That's my son! He came from my womb. Hey! How did this lunatic get here? Nurse! Get her out of here! Good thing I have a strong mother and she was able to deliver the four of us. That's Girlie, the girl. Peter, the boy. And that's me, Mark. Pretty, right? And Panying, that's my tomboy! They're so cute! Your children are so cute! Look, he's crying! Sister, is it true that you gave birth in a mental institution? Yes. They brought me there. I'm sorry... It's your mother's fault! Maybe my mother just panicked. I didn't panic! I have presence of mind. You should thank me because I paid the hospital bill. I'll just settle some business in the US. I'm not crying because of that! I'm afraid of your mother! Just be patient with her, okay? I don't have a choice. It's time to go. You think we're crying because Father left us? We were crying out of fear. Bye. It's because Grandma Amparo leveled up her evil plan. What's happening? We're going out. You want anything? No, I'm okay. Bon voyage. Bye. Wait, are you bringing my children? Stop her! Stop her! Wait! Ma! My children! Ma! You knew about this! I can never ever forgive them. Because of them, our family was never together again. And we lived in poverty. You evil people! Come on, Mark. Let's have breakfast. Go ahead, mother. I'll just work on these four hectares. No need! Come on and eat first. But this carabao has an appointment. What? It's going to watch a basketball game. Girlie! Girlie! Girlie! Half a day passed and you're still sleeping! Dad... In a few hours, it's going to be bedtime again so just let me sleep. Just wake me up tomorrow. I wasn't able to sleep well. What happened to you? I couldn't breathe. Something heavy is resting on my chest. My children are so lazy. And so pretty. Peter... Peter, wake up. It's late. Wake up! Peter, you're already addicted to car drifting. Why are you wearing a helmet in bed? Wake up! Peter! Wake up! Why is it so hard to wake you up? I don't get you, dad. You gave me a nice room, fully air-conditioned and a huge bed... then you won't let me sleep? Are you playing with me? I don't know how you grew up to be so lazy. I'm so hardworking... and handsome! It's too early for a joke, dad. Don't act as if it's your first time here in the farm. I'm used to working in a farm but I'm not used to all these muscles. Stop it! The kids can see you. Mom, who are these two kids? Are you adopting again? Looks like mother wants to put up an orphanage here in the farm. You know this makes me happy. So just let me be. Besides, Joan-p yo is lea ving us. He will be flying soon. Korea is getting me as an exchange student. Exchange student? But you're Korean! Maybe you'll get deported. Wait, what are your names? I'm Bella. My mother is going to work in Japan. She buys vegetables from Mama Pia in the market. No one will take care of me, so she left me with Mama Pia. And I'm Ariel. I live by scavenging garbage in the market. Mama Pia took pity on me so she adopted me. A scavenger yet so handsome, so fair-skinned and so healthy? Do you just scavenge garbage or do you eat it too? I eat it too. You have such fair complexion. What's your name? Ariel. Oh, that's why. Sister, you might get accused of child trafficking. Are we that crowded to cause traffic? I thought we only see heavy traffic in Manila. Yes, as heavy as your hair. We're talking about a different "traffic" here. You don't know a thing about trafficking because all you know is smoke belching! What's child trafficking? According to the second paragraph of Section 3A of the Republic Act 10364... also known as "The Expanded Anti-Trafficking In Person Act of 2012"... the recruitment, transportation, transfer, - harboring, or receipt of a child... - You're giving me a headache. Shall be considered as child trafficking. In layman's term, the selling of children. Panying! Carry her! Girlie... why are you carrying all of that? Son, why don't you carry all these shopping bags for your girlfriend? Jeez, okay? I didn't know. Sorry. Do you need help with that? Is it heavy? Thanks, but no thanks. I have eight arms. Actually, I'm an octopus. And if you really wanted to help, you should have done it earlier in the mall. Marie, please don't spoil her. She might not apply for a job. Darling, that's okay. I'm shopping for my future kids. And of course, I want to shop for my future husband as well. Oh my God! When are you gonna get married? I'm gonna die of excitement! I am... I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die! Joke. Soon, girl. Don't worry, it's going to be very soon. Right? How I wish Dave is as sweet and thoughtful as my dad. Maybe all he cares are my boobies. Why don't you two break up? My boobies? No! Your boyfriend Dave. Papa, don't preach. I've been losing sleep. But I made up my mind. Fm not keeping my baby. I'm out of here. Peter, your medicine! Pps! Bro, this is too much. I think I consumed all your blood. Fm sorry for my anemia... Don't worry. Even if I run out of blood, I still have my phlegm. We still have lots of friends who can donate blood. Our carabao "Kalalakihan." Hers. Why me? I need blood, not squid ink. Stop fooling around. What's important is Panying is okay. So rest now, my daughter. I'm okay but I feel weak with this pink hospital gown. Can I get the blue one next time? Let's go. They're okay now. Sister, go ahead. I'll take care of them. I'll take care of Mark. Okay, I'll go now. It's okay, Ma. Rest well. Take care. Uncle, why don't you go ahead? He'll take care of me. He's okay. And you, you're okay now, right? You can go now and leave us here. You said you're feeling better. Ouch! Sit beside me. Peter Jackstone. Yes, Doc? Your son has a long-term infection of Hepatitis C. The virus is getting alarming. Is it curable? Yes, but we need a compatible donor as soon as possible. But there's no one in the family who's compatible. But I think, we are compatible. Do you have any other family members? Unless you tell them the truth. Well, excuse me. Tell us what, Pops? The truth about you and Girlie. What?! We're not twins? You're twins! Isn't it obvious? But you're not just twins. What? We're married? Your brother has a damaged liver while you have a damaged brain! You're not just twins, you're quadruplets! You mean there are two other Girlies? Another boy and another girl. We have to go to the Philippines. We need to find your siblings and your mother. What? I thought she's dead. Granny told us. Granny... Granny is such a... Granny is such a... goose. Why didn't you tell us, Dad? Why? Why? Why?! - Why?! - Don't shout at me! Why? I don't need to explain! Our priority is for your brother to be cured. So, this is Manila. Crowded, polluted area. Why are you looking at me? - It's too crowded here. - Here, we're sure you'll get cured. Unlike in the province, when you get an attack... we resort to herbal medicine. Are we just going to chat here? Aren't we going to the house we're renting? Let's go before they mistake her as a muffler. You got it wrong! The signage is too small. You should have made it bigger! Are you Peter Jackstone and family? Let's go there! Pops! He's dead! He's dead! - Who? Who's dead? - He's dead! My phone is dead. It's not working here in the Philippines. This can't be real! This means the end of the world! Scary! Even scarier than my dream of French-kissing Dagul. This strawberry mobile has no use! It's better off as fruit salad! Just buy a new cellphone. - Where? - There. Hello, Ma'am! Ma'am, you're so beautiful! You look like a star! - I look like a star? - Yes. Does my face have five corners like that of a star? Are we in the Philippines already? Yes Ma, we're here. Aren't you sweating in that outfit? I have so many memories here. Oh my God! So pretty! Isn't she so pretty? I told you ma'am. I'm gonna buy this! Right now! This is the house. There are two living rooms. Dining is here. Kitchen is there. Master's bedroom is there. - Mom... - Yes? Are we really going to live in this house? It's too big. We can't afford this. I agree. The furniture's complete. And there's a piano. Not just that. No electricity and water charges. Free Wi-Fi. Class! Free Wi-Fi? How much is the rent again? 2,320 pesos. All in. Okay, what's the catch? Why is the rent so low? Nothing! You won't get out of here alive unless you tell us the truth! You're dead. Nothing. It's just that no one can stay here long... so the landlord thought of renting it out for a small amount. But why? There are ghosts! That's your sister! Mom, what is the priest for? I just thought of exorcising this house to get rid of all the ghosts. Mom, no! She's like family to us. Haven't I told you not to make fun of your sister? Don't mind them. Let's get inside so I can show you the ghosts. Don't you want to come with me? Let's go. Here. Ghost! Excuse me. Excuse me. They really brought luggage? I'm so sorry if I'm sick. I've been a burden to you. You should've just left me upstairs. Hi, Marie! Hi, Girlie! Oh my God, you're so beautiful! How are you, darling? I'm okay. Just tired. But I have a lead already. They say Pia is in Sampaloc. Well, I really just want us to get married. So when you find them, make sure you make her sign the divorce papers. I miss you. I love you. Hey, man. Yes? Where can I apply for a job like yours? Janitor? No, a coin bank. It's hard working here in Manila! You're better off in the province. You can be a farmer. Here, you'll just starve. You have to pay for every move. Money is everything. Nothing will happen to you here. If I were you, go back to the province. Are you really a janitor or a guidance counselor? I don't know. And how were you able to know that I'm a barrio lass? You're not a barrio lass... You're a barrio lad. How rude! Just because you're Chinese... How did you know I'm Chinese? There. Looks like I'm going to be lucky today. How rude! You know, I'm also a fortune-teller. Really? What's my fortune? You'll get imprisoned! How rude! You're rude! You're also rude! You started it! You're ruder! - You're rude! - Rude! Who's ruder? You're rude! You should have worn underwear there! - You're ruder! - We're both rude! Yes, we're both rude. Okay, we're all rude. Just a second. Ma'am, check out our watches. They're all original. Made in USA. This one? Here. Mark, when you get hired today, I hope you can ask for an advance. We don'! have enough money for food and for Panying's medicine. Take care. Love you. Miss, may I see that? And that gold one. How about that one? That silver one. Here's the silver one. Wait, Ma'am. This one, Sir? Ma'am, have you picked one? No. I changed my mind. I want a wall clock. Is that so? They have it there. Thank you. Thanks. One, two... Hi, Sir! Sir, you get surprised so easily! Who won't get surprised? I look like this and you call me "sir"? Why, Sir? We have the same hairdo. Sir, I think that's him. Tall, wearing a yellow top, long hair. That's him! That's him! Faster! Catch him! There's a shoplifter in your area. Tall, wearing yellow. A woman... A man... No! No! A gay! Gay! What's happening? Copy, Sir! Excuse me. Are you gay? You want a fight? Do I look gay? Do I look gay? Negative, negative. He's not here, Sir. Have mercy on me! Here. This one. And another one. These are what you've stolen. Sir, I'm so sorry. It's just that my sister is sick. Take his picture. Good. Sir, aren't you going to post this around the mall? Yes. I don't look good in this outfit. So what do you want to happen? Can I just change my outfit? There are lots of nice clothes there. So that I look good in the picture. Selfie, selfie. Just make it quick. Sir, can I change for the last time? So I'll look more fabulous in the poster. That's enough. I'll look more fabulous there, Sir! Last one, please. Fine! Make it quick! Is he done yet? Not yet, Sir. Check on him! Sir! Sir! Sir! He escaped! What are you doing? Look for him! Sir... Have you found him? That one? Not yet. Even the police haven't found him. We don't mind it anymore. Hello! Let's talk later. Bye. Miss... Do you work here? Yes. Have you found him? May I apply? Are you a singer? I don't want to brag, but I can give Aiza and Charice a run for their money. I know... Sorry, sorry. Are you sure about your singer? My singer? I just met her outside and she said she wanted to apply. Why isn't she singing? Boo! Get out of that stage! So that's it? Are you sure you're going to start working? Can you handle it? Isn't that going to stress you out? It's nothing, Ma. I'm just going to sing. And Liza is there to help me. Looks like you're going through puberty. Looks like your face is getting oily. What happened to you? Why are you sweating? Maybe it's because I came from running? Running from someone? Of course not! You're my twin. So I know if you did something wrong. Whatever I did, I did that for you. Sir, the gay shoplifter is back. Oh... Excuse me... Yes? Oh my! Tall girl. Are you a supermodel or something? Yes, before. What happened? It's a career move. Okay. Do you have this on silver? Size 8. Yes, we have. Can I have one, please? Okay, sure. Oh! You left half of your body! I told you, it's a career move! I thought she's tall. - Here is the one. - Thank you. This is really pretty. Where's the partner? Yu said, "Can I have one?" What if I hit you with this shoe? Of course this has a partner! That's really you! I remember that face! You're the thief! Say what? And you even thought of disguising? You even put pepper on your upper lip! And blonde hair? - What are you talking about? - Miss, may I invite you? You mean, like, a date? I'm sorry, I don't think so. - Let's go. - Catch her! Get your dirty hands off me! Bring her to the office! I did not shoplift! I know my right and I know that I have the right to remain silent... because everything that I say might be used against me under the court of law. You know what I'm sayin'? Ma'am, the reason why we invited you here... is because of your shoplifting charges the other day. Shoplifting? I haven't seen a single item in this mall that's even worthy of looking at... and you dare accuse me of shoplifting? And look at me. Do I look like a shoplifter? I'm a supermodel in the States. You know, just settle this with us... because we have strong evidence against you. Aside from pictures, we also captured you on CCTV. Roll VTR. That is not me! That's my twin! Don't make me look stupid. I'm not making you look stupid. I'm making you look stupid if I ask you to comb your hair. What I'm saying is that's not me. That's my twin! So what's the story? You're twins born on a boat. Then a storm came, and one of you was blown away to the US... and the other to the Visayas. Is that it? Beautiful! Great! Yes! That's my story. You, what's your story? You're triplets? The other one is a matchstick... and the other is a cotton bud? And your father is a laundry soap endorser. And your grandfather is a host of a showbiz-oriented talk show? What? Tell me! I know a lot about you! Explosive! So answer me. Now! Arrest him! I have enough evidence to put you to jail forever. Ma, were you able 10 find your Prince Charming? To me, what's important is my Prince Charming. We'll have a happy family and we'll have a lot of children. Maybe around twelve? Right, Ma? Yeah, where's your husband? The father of Mark and Panying? Maybe he's dead. So let's not talk about him, okay? Excuse me, where is Pia's house? There. Oh, there's Pia Moran. How did you meet your husband? Yes, how? A long time ago, he got invited to a party in our house. He's tall. Macho. He entered our house like that. And then, I approached him. When I got near him, he caressed my face. Like this! I can feel his touch until now... so I also caressed his face. And then he suddenly embraced me! So I embraced him back! Pete! Pete! Where are my children? Tell me! Where? I swear I didn't do it! And if this is some kind of a joke, this isn't funny! You don't have the right to detain me! And I'm telling you now... I'm gonna sue you for human rights violation! And I have the right to at least use the telephone. Who was the last one who used this phone? Do you have an alcohol? Do you have an alcohol? Hello? Busy? Police station? Why are we here in a police station? I really don't know. Why? What kind of parenting did you do to our children? Why did she get imprisoned? I don't know. Were you able to talk to my lawyer regarding Marklyn Monroe Jackstone? Yes, Sir. Bro, let Ms. Jackstone out. This is ridiculous! My daughter... Who are you? What are you doing? - Wait, I can't reach you. - Pops! Who are you? Your mom... My daughter? You're so beautiful! You're so beautiful... My daughter... Get your hands off me! Father? Sorry, I messed up your hair. My hair... My daughter, you're so beautiful! I know, right? Hey, thank you for helping me get hired here. That's nothing. Your sister is really close to me. So that's why Panying always wants to go to work. It's because of you. You're beautiful inside and out. Stop it. Just get back to work. You and Panying are a perfect pair. This one, Bro. Stay here for a while. I'm sorry I'm just new here so I can't entertain you. If you want, you can wait for me outside. There's no more bar fine. That's him! Yeah! Looks exactly like a horse! He looks like a horse! You're rude! Wait, don't start a fight! You're drunk! Who's drunk? Who's drunk? Oh you're going to fight back? Come on! Just hold it for me. I have no time for laundry. My shirt might get ripped. Stop it! I don't want you to get hurt! That's enough. Why do you have to walk like that? You walk like you're newly-circumcised. What are you doing there? We're sitting. I know, but why are you sitting here outside? Is there a profound reason for sitting outside? Why are you angry? We're just waiting for Mama. Where did she go? With her husband. Husband? She has no husband! She has! He picked her up here. Oh no. Mama got scammed! No, that's really her husband! If it's not her husband, then why did Mama say... "Pete! Pete! Where are our children? Where are they?" Aren't the both of you her children? My child... Panying, I told you to fix this chair! You! So... - Is this the Jackstone residence? - Yes. That's the house. Upstairs. Your mom... Oh, my son... My son! You're so handsome! What the... Pops! There's another one. Is this because of my hunger or are they really four now? Quadruplets? The two might just be wearing masks. No, they're really four. How many rounds to go? Why does this have to happen? What do you mean? Two faces are already scary enough. Four is unimaginable. You're right. Kids, get inside your rooms now. It's bedtime. Good night, Ma. Are they your children, too? What do you think of me? A pig? After four children, I had another four right away? No, no. My children... Seeing the four of you together makes me feel so good. So what are they here for, Ma? Acquaintance party? Then we'll play Trip to Jerusalem with that woman... who looks like an old mannequin? No Mark, we came here because we need your help. Help? Big word! My mom's name is Pia and not Tina Monzon-Palma... who's the head of a foundation. You came here for help? For twenty-five years that we were suffering, did we ask for help? My son, even if he looks like a giant, he's still your father. Treat him with respect. Son, don't do that. Be thankful that my mother told me that you're my father. Because if she didn't, I'd think that... you're my uncle. So what brings you here... Pa? It's about Peter. He needs a liver. A liver? Seriously? You came all the way here... to ask for liver for a dish that you're going to cook? Don't you have a market there? For a liver?! No, I mean he needs a donor for a liver transplant. I'm just hoping that you or Pan ying may be compatible donors. Our doctor in the US told us that we have better chances with siblings. How did Peter get infected with hepatitis? I think he got it from the food he eats. You guys are so rich and yet you devour contaminated food? We're the ones living in a third world country... who have no access to delicious and healthy food... but you're the ones who are sick with hepatitis? You have a very unfortunate family, Ma! Broken, and unhealthy! Peter has hepatitis. Panying has anemia. I'm sure that blonde woman has a mental condition. My son, are you also sick? Yes. Is that contagious? Yes. My son, what is your sickness? My beauty'- I assume nothing's gonna happen to us here so why don't we just leave? This is not worth it! Why didn't you go to Robin Padilla and ask him for a liver? Hey you blondie, don't act like you're entitled. You're the ones who are asking for a favor and yet you're the one who has no respect! You're right. You won't get anything from me because my liver is not for sale! So you all can leave, right now! Goodness gracious! You're the shoplifter! You were the one caught stealing on CCTV! Oh my God! No way! I cannot take this anymore! No way! My twin brother is a criminal! I can't take it that you're calling me a - Criminal? Brother! Wait, why are you accusing your brother? He's not a criminal. We may be poor but we're not thieves! Son, tell her! If you guys want, let's go back to the mall. Check the CCTV footage so you can see that your son is a thief! What CCTV are you talking about? CCTV! Guys, CCTV! Catch Catch with the TV! Duh! My son, tell her that you're not a criminal! You know that's not true. You're not a thief. I'm getting a heart attack. I invoke my right against self-incrimination! Mark! - Let's get out. - Mark, what's happening to you? Peter! Peter! Oh my God! Oh my God! Mark will recover soon. He fainted because of high blood pressure. But he's stable. How about Peter? Unfortunately for Peter, the only way he can recover... is if we do the transplant as soon as possible. His Hepatitis-C is getting worse. Doc, we're having a hard time finding a donor. What if I donate, Doc? Of course you can't! You're anemic! Mark is the only one who's compatible. We did a test on him yesterday. Doc, we'll have a hard time convincing my brother. We have to bribe him with a dozen basketball players. Girlie, why don't you introduce Mark to some basketball players? Basketball players? I don't know any. How come you don't know any? I thought you're a referee. Excuse me, this is Gucci. How ignorant. You need to convince your son to donate before everything is too late. Oh no, Peter. Doc, if I may ask, how much will the whole operation cost? Don't worry. I'll pay for everything. Ma! Pa! - Yes? - The two are fighting again upstairs! Let's go! No! I won't agree to this. My son, no! No, Ma! My son! No! Not that, son. That's the hospital gown. - This one? - Yes. Isn't this for free? Whatever happens, I will not give you my liver! Not the entire liver. Just a little. Have mercy. Please spare me some liver. Spare you some liver? I can't even spare some alms and you ask me for a liver? How could you not give your liver to your own brother? How could you not care for all of us all these years? Your sister... your brother... and even your mother. Wow, you can speak straight English? Where did you get that? I just read it from the script. Here are my lines. Here's the next line, "How could you!" How could you! You, answer that. So tell us, how do we convince you? There's nothing you can do and I don't need to explain anything. I'm not depriving you of Mother, because it's your right as children. But it's my right to deprive you of my own liver. What do you mean? My liver... never! Ma, this is so hard to take. My son, you might change your mind. Yes, we're quadruplets, but do I really have to share my liver? Yes. Why? Because he's a Belieber. What the hell. Ma, I can't accept this. This isn't fair. They were the ones who lived a luxurious life... and yet I'm the one who will suffer for them? During those times that Panying had nothing to wear... Peter did nothing but shop in the US! During those times that my chest felt heavy out of resentment... Girlie did nothing but enjoy her heavy chest. Ma... My son, Peter is your brother. I hope you still change your mind. Pia... Thank you for convincing Mark. Don't thank me. Thank him. My son, thank you for You play the piano very well. Am I good, Dad? Very good. Why don't you try it? Just play with the cassette. My son, I will forever be indebted to you... for the sacrifice you made for your brother. Don't thank me yet because we're not yet done with the operation. My son, when do you want to undergo surgery? Am I a doctor, Ma? If you want, get a knife right now so we can slice off my liver. Son... By the way Dad, while we're waiting for surgery... can my two imported siblings live here with us? Why? What you're asking me to do is no simple task. I don't want to be the only one suffering. Your brother is sick. Don't make him suffer. Ma, who told you it's going to be my brother? And what place is this? This is the place where we lived in poverty... while you guys were living a comfortable life with that silver outfit. And because I missed the both of you and I am so happy that you're finally here... I'll let you sleep tight because tomorrow... I have prepared something that will surely relax you. I'm excited! I want a frog with a gold coin in its mouth. There's one there. No, on the other side. It's not here. I can't find it. The frogs told me they're going to hang out there. There's no frog here! Hello! There's no frog here! It's on your head. Oh my God, there's no frog here. What took you so long? I can't take a bath because I'm waiting for you! I can't imagine myself doing this for you. Are you a queen or something? Can't you see I'm already having a hard time? You know you're fetching water so why did you wear heels? You know there's no water so why are you taking a bath? Then fill this with more water! What if I don't want to? No liver for your brother. Don't you have a bigger container? Let's take a bath with the entire village! Why did you fetch water? Look, we have water. Your son is an addict! Oh my! My goodness! She doesn't know how to plow. When I was born, did I instantly know how to plow? I had to learn it. She's there! She's there! Mark, what's happening? What are you doing to your sister? If you really want her to plow then I'd help her. Don't even dare help her. So what if I do? Then you're a helpful guy. Goodness gracious! I don't deserve this! I'm tired! I can't do this anymore. Nobody is relaxed while plowing. Oh my God! When are you going to make me stop? The sun has set already. Is there no overtime work in the US? You're the one who's overtime. You're over this time. I've already plowed this entire farm. I'm so tired. You can do it. Don't be too whiny. Oh my God! Please! I wanna quit. That's what I do here every single day. I'm really tired. Brother Mark, when Girlie's hair turns black and her skin gets dark, will you finally stop this? What are you talking about? When will you take pity on your sister? I don't mind if you keep making fun of my skin, but she's not me. I want you to know this. When I make fun of you, that's just a joke. And even if I do that, don't forget that you are beautiful and that I love you so much. I love the four of you so much, especially you. If I don't love you... then I shouldn't have rescued you from the ashtray where your mom left you. Thank you for loving the four of us even if we're not your real siblings. But... Why is it so hard for you to love your real siblings? She's right, Brother. Hey... What are you doing here? That's enough. I can't take this anymore. He's evil. I'm so tired. He's making us suffer like this because he knows we need something from him. I'm sorry. I know you're doing this for me. No, just for your liver. After the liver transplant, I'll make sure he pays for this. Go, take some rest. You don't have to do this anymore tomorrow. Mark! Your uncle and aunt told me that you're making your sister go through hell. Is that true? What did I do wrong? Didn't you tell me you're just going on an outing? Outing. This is out of town so this is an outing. But why are you making her work here? What's wrong with that? You made me work hard here my entire life. Does that mean you're a bad mother? Wait, why did this become about me? Where are your siblings? She's enjoying there. Why are you making Peter work? No, not Peter. That should be Girlie! Peter, stop that! That's bad for you. - Stop it, son! - Where's Girlie? What are you doing there? Peter! Doc! Doc! Please help my son! Get the ultrasound and prepare the patient. Yes, Doc. Check his vital signs and take note of everything. Ma, it's not my fault. It's Girlie's fault. If you don't want to donate liver to your brother... then I won't force you. But don't kill him! You don't understand me. You don't understand me, Ma. You don't know howl feel. You only know how it feels for a wife to be left by her husband... but you don't know the feeling of an abandoned child. I'm not selfish. I never said that I will not give my liver. But I won't give it yet. Because I'm afraid... that when they finally get what they want, they will leave me again. I don't want to be left ever again! People always leave me. I'm so tired of it. But you know Dad, thank you for abandoning me. Because ever since you left, no man can hurt me more than you did. I don't feel any pain anymore. Because nothing is more painful than being abandoned by your father. My son, my son... Pia, Peter's liver is badly damaged. We need to do the operation now. You can slice my liver. You can slice my liver now. Just leave a little for me. Pia, I think this is the right time for me to apologize... for everything that happened. I was surprised, when Mama suddenly arrived in the US... with our two kids. She told me that you two were always fighting... that you found another man... and that you attempted to escape with our children. She said she was lucky that she was able to save Peter and Girlie. That's not true. Pete, you know that's a lie. I wanted to go back to you. I wanted to find you but Mama threatened me... that if I went back to you, she would make us all suffer in poverty... including our children. Pia, I admit I was a coward. I was afraid of Mama. I was afraid for our future. Pia, I'm sorry if I've been a weak father and husband. But I thank you... for raising our children well... Mark and Panying. Let's not talk about the past anymore. What's important is our children are okay now. Thank you, Pia. Catch! Quick! We only have five seconds. Okay? Thank you. Girlie... Oh Peter, my poor brother... as soon as you get well, we'll go back to the States. Girlie, I'm sorry for everything I did. Please forgive me. Thank you, for giving my brother another chance to live. But to forgive you that easily after you made me suffer in the farm? I don't think so. I'll see you there. Doc, did anything happen? Did Mark and Peter die? Mark and Peter? No, your siblings are okay. We just need to observe Peter... to make sure that his body does not reject the organ. Mark needs to rest and we'll also need to observe him for one to two weeks. Excuse me. You're overreacting! I thought somebody died! Tears of joy. Can't I be in tears out of too much joy? Yes, you can. Enough of this. Mark may see you. He'll get jealous. He'll get jealous? That fag twin brother! I'm so G-R-R-R-R-R to the hundredth power. He even had the guts to say sorry in the hospital? G-R-R-R-R. I will not let him off the hook. Mark my word. I'm gonna make him suffer just the way I did. Oh please, whatever it is you're scheming, stop it. I know what to do now. There is a saying, "The best way to defeat any gay is to beat his heart all the way." Where did that come from? From me, is there anybody else in this room? Liza, order anything. My treat. One crispy pork leg, two servings of rice and one family-size softdrink. How about you? That's all for you? Yes. I'll have a glass of water. Let's order. Wait, why are you hugging me? We're no longer a couple, right? But we never separated! We're so close. We can't be separated. Let's order now, love. Let's order now. Oh... What kind of food is this? Is this for real? This tastes good! Brother, try this. That's yummy. You're right. What's this? Chicken ass! Yuck! Ass?! You don't eat chicken ass? NO Way! Harry, I really don't know how to eat street food. Can you teach me how? What a flirt. It's easy. Open your mouth. My mouth? Yes, as simple as this. Like this? And then? Then chew... Chew it... There. This is fun. This is yummy. Yummy? Yummy. What's with the face? Why are you acting like a sixteen-year-old? Why not? Don't tell me this is about Father. Of course not. He was just sweet last night and now you act like you're a Ioveteam? I'm sorry, sir. Well, this is just a hunch. But did you see how your father looked at me? Don't you think he wants us to get back together? Ma, are you from Hope Foundation? No. Because you're getting your hopes up. You're hoping to get back together to get hurt again. So pessimistic. Why can't you just let them be happy? Can't you see? They're like spoon and fork... bread and butter, soy sauce and vinegar, they fit together! What? Like the two of us, we're a pair. You, who's your pair? Harry, right? It's your relationship with Harry that you should be minding. That's what I'm afraid of. I have a feeling that Blondie has a plan. She will do everything to get Harry from me! Don't think about those things. We can be one happy family again if they get back together. Right? Try this. How is it? Delicious! In fairness. Looking good! You too, bro. Sorry, bro. I forgot you're fresh from surgery. Sorry, sorry. What did you do? Sorry, bro. Jesus Christ! You know I just came from surgery and that I'm still recovering. If my liver gets damaged again, I don't know who else can donate. Don't worry. We can ask Reno. Who's Reno? Liver spread. Why did you come here? Dad's not here. I didn't come here for Dad. I wanted to talk to you. What seems to be the problem? It's about our sibling who has out-of-this-world boobs. You mean Girlie? No, I was talking about me. Who else has boobs among the four of us but Girlie? So what's this? Hey! Those aren't boobs. I'm sleep-deprived. Those are eyebags. So what about Girlie? Please talk to her. Tell her to stop flirting with Harry. Mark will surely get mad. Okay, I will try my best. But I cannot promise I can persuade her. I mean, she's really hard-headed and hard-chested. She never listens. I just don't want our family to be broken again. I don't want the four of us fighting. I want the four of us together in peace. Happy. I feel you, bro. Ouch! You're such a Joker. You're such a Batman. Batman, Joker. Is it okay for you to stay here beside me? I think something wrong's gonna happen. If you don't stop flirting, I'll make sure that happens. I'm afraid! I'll just be here. Blondie. Here's your order of crispy pork drenched in vinegar. 50"!!- Excuse me. You're such a slut! She tripped me. Sorry, my leg won't even touch you. I smell like vinegar. I'm sorry. Go upstairs and take a bath. Oh my gosh! Hey. Sorry. I opened the wrong door. What are you doing here? I'm looking for the toilet. Toilet? There's one downstairs. Down there? Sorry, if I can't go with you. Somebody might see us and I might get fired. I will call somebody. Wait here. No. Just kiss me. So I'd be brave enough to go to the toilet... alone. You shameless people! How crass! Your hair might be white but there's nothing darker than your heart! Boyfriend stealer! Excuse me? Boyfriend? You two are not even together! Harry! Tell him you're not a couple. Come on, tell him! Tell him that you're not in a relationship. Tell him! I'm not a "him", I'm a "her"! No. You're a "him"! Vguhs a 'him n! You pee in the men's room while I go to the ladies'. And when I pee, I do it sitting down, while you do it standing. If I sit down then my thing will get wet! '(Wm a uh' mu' Yes! My fist is a "him"... and if I punch your face, let's see if you can still get up. Push it! Oh push it? Wait! Our daughter is so good! - Just like me. You're really good! - Good job! You're so good. Ma. Where's Blondie? She went with that man whose shirt was spilled with vinegar. Where's Mark? I think he followed them. Big trouble! Peter, let's follow them. If that's a problem, then we should go with you. No Ma, you stay here. We'll take care of this. Someone will sing "I Am What I Am", "Rico Mambo" and "Shake Body Body Dancer". I'll take care of this. Hey, that's enough! Enough! Stop fighting! Stop it! That's enough! It's that fag snatcher's fault! You snatched everything away from us! Get out of here! Go back to America and don't ever come back! Fag! Fag! Fag! Fag! Didn't I tell you to stop doing this to Mark? And why would I listen to you? Excuse me, I'm the eldest here. How come? I'm first in the title of this movie fi "Girl, Boy, Gay, Lesbian" So I'm the youngest? Is your Brother Mark home? Ma. Yes Ma. He's been crying in his room. So I went out. I'm afraid I might get drowned in his tears. Go and sleep in his room. Just get a floater so you won't drown in his tears, okay? Good night, Ma. Pia... I think we have to do something to reconcile our two girls. It's hard to talk to Mark when he's angry. I'll take care of this. I'll set them up. We'll bring them to a nice place. I thought you're also a standee. Don't start it. I'm really pissed right now. Sorry. Wait, why are you pissed? Nothing. I just don't like the color of those balloons. Oh, okay. Gotcha! In fairness to the timing of this vacation, it's also our birthday. This would've been happier if we were complete. But we're complete. Me, you, mother. Are we just triplets now? That's what I'm saying. Don't be like that. Just be happy. Okay? Let's all be positive! Happy! Oh! There they are! There they are! Come on! - Pia... Pia... - Hello. Your children. - Son. - Hello. Hello, Girlie. I knew it. This is a trap. But if you think we're going to make up because it's our birthday... you got H all wrong. My daughter, you've been fighting for so long already. Can't you just make up? I just want to go home. This is nice. Can I check it out? Sure. Nice. I think this suits me. That is really nice. Actually, I'm wearing one right now. And it suits me well. I don't know if I can say the same for you. These lenses are really impressive. It's clear, but when exposed to the sun, they get dark. Just like the heart of my twin. That's really impressive. Just like your armpits. Even without sunlight, they're already dark. I'll try this later. I'll just get a scrub. My son, I hope you can forgive your sister Girlie. Why isn't she the one asking for my forgiveness? Forgive her, bro. Don't fuss over a guy. You speak as if there is a surplus of hot guys. If they're so many, why did you have to be one? Bro, the thing is you love with all your heart. You think your heart is bigger than Girlie's chest. That's why you feel so heavy inside. My son, I know you understand better. And I know you'll be a good example to her. So this is how it feels to be embraced by your father. How I wish I felt this during those times I needed you. When was that? That summer when I had to be circumcised. I was so afraid. I'm the only one without a father. What happened? I backed out. I just asked Panying to go. Son... Do you still want to push through with it? No! I can see it from here. Son, your father just told me that you had a fight with Girlie. That's true, Ma. It's because of Girlie. She has no conscience. After what Mark has done for me? I don't know what happened to her. She's been my elder sister... She's been my savior... When we were still kids, you used to teach me what is right and wrong. This time, I'll be the one to teach you. Please make up with Mark... since you're the eldest. And it's also your fault. Sorry... Hello? Why is it so hard to contact you? We're out of town. Family bonding. Are you serious? What happened to the divorce papers? Had they been signed? Marie, I was just thinking... What if we just cancel the divorce? Since living-in is the trend now. And you always want to be trendy right? No! We can't! Do you know that this marriage has been long planned? This has to push through. I have to see your Pops as soon as possible. Wait, wait! You might trip! Did you have fun, sweetheart? Oh, Pia... I'm sorry. No, sweetheart is fine. Look at me. I look fine, right? I'll prepare dinner. I'll cook your favorite. - Okay, okay. - I'll just cook. Dad... Marie is here in the Philippines. What? That's okay. She doesn't know where we are. Dad! Oh my God. Why? I gave her the address. I'm sorry! Who is she? Who is that? Who are you? How did you get in here? Right. Do you own this house? Of course not! Do you think I'm gonna buy this old house ? Duh! Then... you're a robber! I'll have you beaten up! Marie, what are you doing here? How did you get in? Hello, don't you remember that we own Mr. Quickie Philippines? We're locksmiths. Wait! Wait! You know her? Of course! He's my fianc! Didn't you tell her wh y you're here in the Philippines ? For the liver transplant. Aside from that! You needed her to sign the divorce papers so we can get married. Right, sweetie? Marie, do you wanna go shopping? I saw something that can seal your lips permanently! Girlie? You knew about this? You know her? You're involved here? Pia, let me explain. Explain? What for? You know Pete, you never changed. And you never will. You're used to fooling people. What's painful is you had to do it at my children's expense. Get out of here! Right now! Can I explain? You don't need to explain anything... because we all know that your heart is as black as your giant mole! Mole? Yes, there above your lips! Mole of Asia! Where? There on your face. Oh my God! All this time I have a booger on my mouth and no one even bothered to tell me! Yuck! A booger indeed! Get out of here! You're American but you're cheap! Oh my God! Wait! Pete, hello! What about the divorce papers? Ma, is it true that you already signed the annulment papers? Yes, Brother. She signed the annulment papers. Why are you crying? Do you know what annulment is? Hey, help me. What's annulment? You asked for it. Brother, I'm sorry. I don't know what annul means. Is that related to canal? Ma, why did you sign it? Why did you agree? You're the rightful wife. You have that right. So even if Dad promises marriage to anyone, you're still the rightful wife. - You have the right. - Can you please keep quiet? No, Ma. You are the rightful wife. Don't ever agree. You are the rightful wife. You are the rightful wife. If you don't stop, I'm going to throw this glass at you. You... you are my rightful mother. Delivery, Ma'am. Excuse me, Sir. For you. What's that? Okay, you read it. Thank you, Sir. What's that? She signed them. The divorce papers? Oh my God! Pete! I'm so happy! She really signed them! Oh my God! I'll tell Mother! Where's my phone? Fm so happy we can go now. Hello. Hello, Mom. She finally signed the divorce papers. I'm getting married! Bye, Manila. Fm gonna miss you. Good morning, Dad. Girlie, are you sick? Are you all right? Dad, I'm okay. I just miss preparing breakfast just like Mama used to do. Peter, did you prepare this? Yup, Dad. My God! You guys are awake! You're awakening? Careful. Who are you? Granny, I'm your most beautiful granddaughter. What evil spirit possessed you? Granny, no evil spirit can possess me anymore... because all of them are enjoying your body. You're not Girlie! Shut your big mouth. Oh, Girlie! My granddaughter! There. Granny, can you tell us more about Mama? Who's your mother? Mama Pia... Ah! My son's wife! You know, Pia and Pete used to love each other so much. They can't be separated! But they're separated now. And soon, Pops is gonna get married to Marie. Oh my God! Your father can't marry another woman! You know, I miss Mama, Panying and Mark. Me too... but we might not see them anymore because of what we did. Sad... Three bottles of beer and three margaritas. Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. No. You're not okay. How can I be okay after what happened? I thought everything is okay. But it was all a joke. But what pisses me the most is even if I'm mad at them... why do I still miss them? You will be one again. You're a family, right? Thank you for always being there for me. You never leave. Even when I've left, you're still there. Are you waiting for something? You know there's somebody here who always thinks of you. Even when we were in the farm, you just don't notice him. I hope this doesn't end here in this movie. What? Nothing. Cheers! Wow! This is really grand! Darling, why don't we get married there at the Golden Gate? Then let's have our reception at Alcatraz. It's so beautiful! Hush! Don't be too loud! My daughter-in-law Pia might hear you. Shut up! You old, forgetful woman! You should be at the Home For The Aged! Marie... never shout at my grandmother. Yeah, right! Shut up! Peter! Sorry, Dad... Sorry. Marie, please get out. Excuse me? I said, get out! Are you doing this just so you can cancel our wedding? I don't need more reasons. Your disrespect for my mother is more than enough for us not to get married. Oh is that it? Okay, fine. Don't be too hot-headed. Okay, I'll make up with her now. Mommy! Mommy! Girlie, hold this. - You! I will push you if you don't stop! - Oh my God! Marie! Don't worry. She won't fall. There's a barrier. Marie, you're disrespecting my family! Okay... I'm calling this wedding off! I'm okay with my family. Girlie! Peter! Hey, I'm also part of this family! - Ouch! - Granny! Karma! See... I don't get why she uses a wheelchair, she's not even a politician. Oh, I remember now, I can walk. After everything that I've done for you guys, this is how you repay me? Yes. I think I made the right choice. I'd rather marry someone who has a heart for the family. I hate you! I hate you too! I'm calling this wedding off! Oh, dude. I'm sorry. We have a situation. We need your help, bro. So who needs another organ transplant this time? Stop playing with my body organs. Are you cannibals? Why are you hot-headed all the time? Why don't you install air-conditioning on your forehead? Who won't be hotheaded with all the betrayal you did? Girl, why don't you try to move on? You Filipino-American girl! He's a Fil-Am? Yup. Fil-Am. Half-feeling, half-ambitious. How rude! Wait! Wait! Don't end this video call yet. I have an important thing to tell you. The wedding is cancelled. Pops and Marie broke up. Because Marie... day and night... has no panty. Really? Yes, Bro. We are not kidding. Dad broke up with her because... he still loves our Mama. How funny! Mama feels the same. So that's why the past few days, Mama was always sad. And not just that, she talks in her sleep, looking for Papa. They still love each other. So you mean... There is hope for them to get back together? That is why we called you. We need your help. We need to come up with a plan for them to get back together. Well... I have a bright idea. And only Mark can pull this off. Promise? Honest? I'm the star? After all, we are family. And families, no matter what happens... are meant to be together, loving one another. Are you sure with this plan? Seems too complicated. According to Girlie... this is the only way for Papa to go back to the Philippines. Uncle and Auntie know about this already... and they said if something wrong happens to Mama because of this... they will bury you quadruplets! Do you know who are the quadruplets? Of course! Who? The four of us kids. Right? You're so ridiculous. Just make sure Mama won't know that I'm the one who "died". I don't want to hurt her feelings. I hope you succeed with this absurd plan. I'm the star here so I'm sure this will be a success. Close H. Let's go. - Help them. - You do it. Put everything in the car now. Who died? What's happening? He?' What's going on? Girlie, what happened? It's about Mark, Dad. What about Mark? He's dead! Mark is dead! Who's Mark? Mark is dead. And we gotta go back to the Philippines right now! I'll just get my passport and my wallet. No, it's in the car. We fixed everything. Everything is okay, nothing to worry. Let's go! Who's the grandchild? Mark. Who's Mark? Your grandchild. We're about to start. Why aren't they here yet? I've been calling Peter and Girlie since last night but no one's picking up. Hey! What's happening there? Are they here yet? Yes, they're near. Don't worry... they'll surely get here within this month. Impatient. Stop talking. They might hear you. So who died? Do we really have to attend the funeral? Am I close to this person? Very close! Very close, Sister. What's important is you're here. He's our neighbor. We have so many neighbors. My child... Wait, why do we have to be here? We're an all-star cast. Who died? Someone very close to us. Auntie Tentay, our neighbor who owns an eatery. But we're not close. Fine, let's take a seat. Hello. Peter, where are you? We're at the cemetery. The funeral is on-going. Holy cow! We're stuck in traffic. Where exactly? Up in the air. We can't land because of air traffic. We're dead! Where's the dead? At the mall, Father. Joke! Of course, he's inside the casket. What's his name? Can we just give you his nickname? Marky. Your brother's namesake. Marky. Coincidence. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit... Amen. Jesus who resurrected... What's this? Why am I going to be buried? Father, time out. We're waiting for someone. I'm sorry. I still have three funerals today. We can start the burial. - Stop them. - Stop them. Wait! Stop, Father. No! Wait. You go ahead. Wait! Wait! Have mercy! Wait, Father! No! No! Wait, please check if the grave is deep. This isn't a good plan! This can't happen, Ma! That's not your relative. - This can't be!!! - But why? No! Have mercy! Ouch! My finger got stuck! Ma! Is he your relative? We don't even know him. - Ma, no!!! - Panying, what are you doing? Hey, have you tried it down there? Stop her. What's that? What kind of a joke is this? - This can't be!!! - Ma! Why? Girlie, let's go! Faster! Hey! I can't breathe. My daughter, please... I said wait! My daughter, what's happening? Pia... Hey! Pete! What are you doing here? Pia, I'm sorry. What? Ma, the Wedding's cancelled. Pops broke up with Marie. I'm sorry too but I can't bring myself to love you... after all the pain you caused me. Pia, I knowl made a lot of mistakes in life. Ma! Pa! There's only one thing I did right. That I loved you sincerely. Let me kiss away the pain in your heart. - Get on with your wooing later! - Me? I'm not in pain. I'm okay. You're not sad? No. Your son died! That one? No, he's just Mark's namesake. Super talk show. You're going to regret this. Please make up now! That's my son's voice! Our son is haunting us! Right away? I can't breathe! I'm still alive! This is just our gimmick so that Papa will come home and you'll be together again. What? Whose idea is this? Girlie planned this! Come here! And we were finally able 10 bury everything that happened. We were able 10 push Mama and Papa to be together again. Fm so happy because we're finally complete. Bu! wait, all of us should be happy here. So when I learned that Girlie really loves Harry, I gave way. And these children... they taught us how to love one another. If they can love one another even if they are not real siblings... we can do that too. Panying and Liza are happily in love. So Aiza and Charice... get ready because my sister can beat you both in singing and in love. Now let's talk about my beauty. I have the most handsome boyfriend in the world. We're all happily in love. But wait, how about Peter? There. All of us are happy now. Bu! nothing can be happier than a family that stays together. Hey, come here! Come here! Like this ii selfie-seffie but with the family.
