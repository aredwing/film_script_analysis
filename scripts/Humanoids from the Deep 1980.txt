Dr. Susan Drake, great scientific has conducted research in our laboratories, upstream Over the past seven years. And she says she have been manipulated how to make salmon grow bigger, faster, and two times more abundant. Without doubt, these are news we can really celebrate. So Jo and her band we provide a great ball and enjoy the festival this year. Thank you very much. From what I heard, we should thank you for the work he has done. Jim said to be morning fishing.

There was someone outside. What? I heard nothing. All dogs were killed, except for Eagle Johnny. Yes, that says Slattery. Can you think of something? No, I have come to nothing. I have no suspects. Slattery seems yes. Someone killed my dog, Slattery. Do you know who might be? What a coincidence. Somebody Killed seven of our dogs last night at the dock. Do you know who might be? I do not dogs murderer get what I want. End with this. Take this to court. Buy a circle around your lands along the River. Stop your packaging, Slattery, and through the law. Your law! Guys, this idiot was not invited to this party. It is disturbing to our friends. Moore, take it out of here. Take him away. Folks, nothing has happened. Come on, play music and continue with the party. Slattery, evil bastard. I got sick of your emissaries. Why do not you behave like a man and face me?

Considering hiring a lawyer against us and the filler. So I worry. And that's not all. It got one of those great urbanites lawyers to protect minorities and free help. I suppose it's for get publicity. Should get a lawyer, Hank. And then what? This will take two years get to court. Do you think that these types of packaging will wait for solve our problems? No way! We will have to deal with Johnny Eagle and its people, - Or not have filler. - How? Can you think of something? As we can, that's all. - See ya, brother. - Yes How's your face? I'm alive. - Thanks again. - You were worse than me. Thanks anyway both. - Any man would do the same. - Jim, I want to talk about something. The filler. Johnny, I stand for and you do not. Nothing more to say. The truth is that even While these rates will fall, but believes that people need the filler and he wants - The best for the people. - Me too.

It always works. What would you do without me? Well, just watch. Hey, come on. What do you think you're doing? Two is company, three is a crowd. - He's pretty sexy. - Not as much as you, baby. My father used to bring here as a child. This is beautiful. So I want to save for my people. If not, we cover, Who will? What is that? I do not know. There are many visitors here. Let's go.

And I'm good company. Okay. Then we to clean some fish. Come as much as possible. - Hi, honey. - You scared me. I thought you were cleaning fish. I wanted to come see if you were okay. How sweet.

I will follow up the people! Hello. Good morning. I would like to rent a boat. I would not recommend. Al least not this morning. Thanks. Jerry and Peggy missing Linda is dead... What the hell is going on here? All I know is that Linda was Eagle in the van. Yes, what about it? See what I see? Where did this boat that fool? Explanations have to give, Johnny. Help me upload it here. - I'm with him. - Yes, stay with him. - Come on, take him away from here! - Go! - How big were they? - 6.5 to 7 feet tall. How many dresses? What the hell is happening? What happened to my brother? You will not believe this. They say it was a kind of sea monster. So, sea monsters! They burned his house attacked your brother, and even brought their dead, right? Well, I'll go there. Anybody with me? - Why? - To look for evidence. Something caused the accident Buck-O and killed those dogs. Now human attacks. The that is, not him. I need a partner, Slattery. What say you? It's a waste of time. Scared? Fear of what? - Potter? - My son did not return last night. Neither Peggy. I looking for my son I have no time to go after sea creatures. I'll go with you, Jim. A moment. Do not think you should go before you speak. Want to join me, Hank? I have my priorities, Jim. I should be in the hospital when it is your brother. Then, you'll need communicate it to me to me. I need it. Been there, know what we want. - I'll go with you, Jim. - Do not need anyone else. Forget your manners obsolete. I a professional scientist! Let's go. This is where we for the first time. Well, look at this. Let's see... Know much more if we leave here. What am I supposed you are looking for now? See if you left a card visit, I guess. Definitely been here. No joking, right? Do you think that more of these creatures around here? I thought I heard something down. I said I thought I heard something. The type of attack that he described, is a nocturnal predator, therefore probably hide during the day, unless your territory is threatened. - Is this is your territory? - Not sure. We found evidence that were here last night but it means nothing. Judging by its size, must be of the ocean. Seems pretty confident. I must be with men like you out there. Come on. Let's get out of here. What's this? Is quite similar, but head is much larger. Must have developed more than I imagined. And perhaps more intelligent. Johnny, grab it. Damn, a salmon. First time I let myself down to see a fish. Think about this: Finding salmon of this size here can not be so far to find what you seek. I just talked to my wife on the radio. The doctor says my brother will be fine. Has anyone talked to him? No, still unconscious. But his vital signs are strong. How much do you know and tells us, Drake? Could I leave those things and treat me a moment? You have seen what I did. You say you are smart, surprised by the size their jaws. Other than that, is very interested in the subject. - That cove, Jim. - What about her? Seems to have caves there. Where do they lead? There's your evidence. See that? No, do not shoot until you tell them. Now! Now, shoot! Are you okay? I owe my life. Oh, my God. Who is it? God, it's Peggy. Still alive. Take it from here. What the hell are these things, anyway? First, from what I know so far This species makes its appearance. But there must be a reason for a humanoid creature evolve so quickly. - Do you see the guts in his head? - Yes, like a fish. But they do pretty well coming to earth. Yes, we know so far. But his natural habitat is clear, water. So I guess that is in process to become amphibious. Look at the size of the skull. That means they have a tremendous brain capacity. Though not mean they have the ability to use it in its entirety. Look. Developed hands. Why not return to Noyo? Les know if we find something. Forget it. We're not going to get answers. - Do not worry. - Mr. Borden suggested keep this secret Canco has a chance until for revision. His theory could be totally incorrect. What the hell are you talking about? I tried to warn this long ago and I stepped aside. Well look at it, Edwards! Is right in front of you! Damn stupid! Look! And still insists that my theory is wrong? My theory is incorrect and I will not be quieter. And these people have the right viz. And I'll tell you. Put the film 232, DNA in the conference room. Now, Edwards! DNA-5 is a stimulant growth. What you see is a film of the first DNA-5 experiments with frogs. These are tadpoles in the larval stage. The tadpoles take 12 weeks to become adult frogs. Now we apply DNA-5, carries genetic information stimulating hormone growth in frogs. Using DNA-5, reaching to adult in a matter of days. And what's the point? Duplicate this process to accelerate growth in salmon. When a storm destroyed one of our experimental ponds 3000-treated salmon DNA-5 escaped into the ocean. I wanted to notify the authorities, but my employer of cancer, I stopped. What if the other fish they had been eaten? Exactly. My theory is that by feeding salmon treated with DNA-5 could accelerate the evolution a more primitive fish, as the coelacanth, which was discovered in this area a few years ago a local marine biologist. What the hell is a coelacanth? It is a kind of prehistoric fish that has not evolved in millions of years. But I could have done to salmon fed with DNA-5. I took these pictures this morning. In a life, this creature seems make four stages of evolution. See that as a fish, but is humanoid early stage. Why attack us? Well, most predators protect its territory and their food sources. Perhaps it is enough intelligent to perceive the man as a competitor. Why girls? My theory is that these creatures have the impulse mate with humans development of incredible evolution. These things almost killed me with fright. Who among the people will believe us? Rays. The festival. Oh, my God. I'm the Mad Mike Michaels broadcasting live from Salmon Festival. We here at Radio K-Pez in the Salmon Festival. And here's my favorite skater, Katie. How are you? Listen, she will walk hanging around and if caught, will win free visor.
