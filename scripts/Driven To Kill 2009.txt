You hide a metal spike under a cup... and take turns betting until someone hits the cup with the spike? - How crazy were you guys? - We were young and stupid. It was a long time ago, so we don't really talk about it much anymore. Tell me the trick. Come on. How did you know where to find the metal spike? I want the whole thing. Metal spike, the roulette... Everything, baby. Please? I know you won't get hurt. If you do it for me, I will do anything you want. Baby, you've given me anything I want for five years now. Yes. But you know my girlfriend Selena? - I do. - She hasn't... and I promise you, if you show me this trick, that you'll have both of us. Can you hurry up and start doing this, please? Okay. - Close your eyes. - Okay. - Are you ready? - I'm ready. Oh, my God. How did you know that? I didn't. The trick was just to not give a fuck. She's marrying Stephan Abramov? He uses Arbarn now. He's not like his father. You'll see. Yeah, I understand that, but why am I always the last to know? Lanie was afraid to call. She knew how upset you'd be, but, Ruslan, she wants you here. I really think she needs you. It's tomorrow afternoon. I'm hoping you can catch a flight. Oh, believe me, I'll be there. That's wonderful. Your daughter will be very happy, Ruslan. - You have a pen? - I know where you live, Katya. We moved. What happened? It's a long story, and it's not a very happy one. We'll catch up when you get here. I'll go get a pen. - California? - It's that obvious? Hey, too much sun, not enough tenement buildings,you know? You don't get sandwiched amongst enough people... you wind up never knowing any. Ruslan. Ruslan. I had a feeling that you'd come back. Oh, my... No friends, only enemies. Loyalty cost us everything, Brot. - Loyalty between you and me... - Da. cost us our freedom for five years. - Mm-hmm. - Five fucking years in the Gulag. There are not many of us left who remember those days. - Please tell everyone... - Yeah? - I'm back here only on personal business. - Of course I will... but I'm not sure they would believe it. Well, I don't care. It's personal business... family business. Absolutely, absolutely. I'll get the message to Mikhail. The guy in California is writing a book about your life. I read it too, and I think your enemies read it too... and because of that, I want you to have this. Be careful, Ruslan. Okay? - Welcome back. - Do svidaniya. Brot, do svidaniya. - He asked you a question. - You know, I was just leaving. Too late for that, huh? You offended us. You need to be punished. It'd be really nice if I could just leave, you know. It's not gonna happen. Oh, fuck.! Okay, now I guess it's you and me. Fuck. I'm so sorry. I'm not like you. I'm just a pretender. Didn't you say, "If someone does something bad... - he just has to be punished"? - No, no, it's a joke. Joke? Get down on your knees. This will be the first time... you ever are punished for telling a bad joke. I'll go to get my broom. Do svidaniya. Ruslan? You forget who's paying for this damn thing. I should get a say in who goes. He's her father. She wants him there. - Do you want him there? - Leave me alone, Terry. - I asked you a question. - What is the question? Do I want a real man to give my daughter away on her wedding? Fancy place. You say your wife lives here? - Ex-wife. - Looks like she's throwing one hell of a party. Somebody getting married? My daughter. This one, and this one, please. Yeah. We're gonna actually... Come on in. You must be Ruslan... - the guy who writes the snuff books. - Yeah. Terry Goldstein. I'm Catherine's husband. I'm also a defense attorney, so I defend guys like you. I mean, the guys in your books. You have met Terry? Yeah, we werejust talking about my books. Seems like he's a fan. - He should be. - And you... You've done a greatjob with my baby. When was the last time I saw you? Graduation? No, law school. She's a prosecutor now at D.A.'s office. And where is she? She's upstairs. The limo arrives in three hours to take us to the church. Try to convince her that if she doesn't wear the veil... she'll end up looking like a Victoria's Secret model. Okay. Hey. Dad? I've missed you. I've missed you too. - So, what did she say? - You're more beautiful than ever. Which I knew. And that I shouldn't be late for the wedding. Did she say anything else? There was some arguing on the phone. Yeah, the guy she married's a bit of a prick. I met him downstairs. I want you to meet my fianc. Ruslan, nice to meet you finally. My name is Stephan Arbarn. Nice to meet you. You know, um... maybe I can spend a few moments with him... and talk a little... you know. I'd like that. It's important to me. The limo and the church... It can wait. Ah,just a few minutes. Remember those stories Ruslan used to send you when you were small? Yeah, the dragon and the little blind girl? She used to think that he was just a swan... and he never wanted her to figure out otherwise. It's kind of sad. Don't blame your father for that. Stephan is my life now. Do you need your father's approval to keep feeling that way? I learned a long time ago he wants us to have what he cannot give. I'm glad he came today. Gangster? Whoa. I think we're getting off on the wrong foot. My father is the gangster, and he wants me to follow in his... Footsteps. Yeah, I know. Then you met Lanie. And she expects more from me. Yeah. Let me ask you... Do you think Mikhail might blame my daughter or me... for taking you off the path? Look, my father's old-school Russian. He expects me to come crawling back someday... maybe to turn into someone like you. You don't know me. And all the people I worked with... None of them lived to tell the story. Then we won't speak about it. That would be best. - When they leave, we go in. - All right. We'll bring it around back. Hey, Lanie. I don't want to disturb you. I, uh... I know you already have a ring. This... belonged to my mother. She was from St. Petersburg, and she was very beautiful,just like you. I would love for you to have this. Lanie, Terry's gonna drop me off at the church. We can drop Ruslan off at his hotel on the way. Whose ring? Thank you, Daddy. It's beautiful. I know how valuable it is to you... so I'll wear it and I'll treasure it. Why don't I put this over here for later... for the wedding ceremony. I'll, uh, go to the hotel and get changed and meet you at the church. - I'll have Terry pick you up. - Well... I mean, I can take a taxi. Daddy, please. For me. - You have to learn to get along. - Okay. And, Daddy... don't judge Stephan too hard or too fast. If you're happy, I'm happy. And you're happy, so go on. This is the last of the flowers. Where should I put them, Mr. Goldstein? How the hell should I know? Ask my wife. No! No! No! Hello? Yeah, Goldstein... I thought, you know, for Lanie's sake... - you and I should... - Look, look, look. I need you to hang on a minute, okay? Something's happened here. I need you to talk to my sergeant. Hello? Hello? Hello? Yeah, let him through. You talk to both of them? Wanna bag that? We're gonna have to dust for prints in all areas. How is she? Stab wounds. Concussion. She's critical but stable. Sharp dresser. - Where you from, Detective? The 2-6? - Yeah. Like hell. That's my number. What the fuck is this? He's the father. - We think they were looking for a safe in here. - This was no robbery. Whether this was a robbery or a setup to look like one... we're still gonna check into everything. You do know whose family your daughter was marrying into, right? The husband of the girl just arrived. He's not her husband, number one. Number two, we gotta be in agreement... Nobody... not Goldstein, not Stephan... can know my daughter's still alive. Yeah, okay. We'll get six of those. Mm-hmm. That's best for us too. Who's in charge here? I want to see my wife. Where is she? Oh, my God. Catherine. Where is she? I want to see Lanie. - Is she... - The body's already been removed from the site. Ruslan, tell me what happened. Tell me what happened. Tell me what happened. Ruslan. The uniform will be there, da? The end of the hall, 24/7. You sure you'll be okay? I could wait and give you a ride back to your hotel. That's a good idea. And do you promise you won't share the fact that she's alive with anyone else? It'll damage our case if the killer finds out. That's my daughter. Of course. And you can't think of anyone in her life who you believe is capable of doing this? No. I mean, there are many people who are capable, but, uh... I don't know why anyone would do something like this. You have a past here, right? What do you mean? She was marrying Mikhail Abramov's son. He's Russian mob. Oh, is he? The same group of men you ran with 20 years ago. Who told you that? I'll give you some privacy. Don't worry, my baby. You're gonna be well. And those who did this to you will cry tears ofblood. This I promise you. The cop at the end of the wing told me you were here. How's my baby? She sustained some serious internal damage. A sharp object punctured her chest cavity. She's suffered blunt trauma to the head and neck. Doctor, listen to me. When you're gonna talk to me about her, look me in the eyes. She'll recover. It'll take time, but she's very lucky. Let's keep the luck going. If there's anything at all, you call me at this number. Stephan seemed pretty torn up... naturally, I guess. - I mean, you'd expect that, right? - Yeah. Listen. I'm gonna pass on that ride home. Having a nice day? Sorry. I guess I should have knocked. I lost someone I loved,just like you. So, that puts us in the same boat? Yeah, I guess so. Fact is, I want revenge as much as you. But let's face it... I don't have the same skills in this area as a man like you. What do you know about my skills? I know what I see. You're a dangerous man, Ruslan. You want revenge. So do I. I will find the people who did this. Believe me. I can help you. I don't want to be involved, but I know a man... who can help you get the tools you need for a job like that. Why does that not surprise me? I'm a lawyer. These are the people off whom I make my money. Now,you know what? I'm gonna write this man's number down right now... because I know you're not gonna want to waste any time. That's true. I won't be. By the way, I, uh... I tried to arrange to have Lanie placed beside her mother... but the morgue wouldn't release the body. When this is over, I will take Lanie's ashes... back home with me. So the lawyer says we're not gonna use any names... Ruslan from L.A. So you go to Wal-Mart for your clothes but not your guns, huh? What, you can't wait? You got a little problem with the wife? No. So what do you need? Sure shot? Hole in the door? Spray the school yard? - Thirty-eight. - You know disco's dead, right? Thirty-eight doesn't leave brass. Maybe I can test-fire just a little bit. You a cop? 'Cause I'm starting to get that feeling. No. Shooting little bit far to the left and high. Maybe I can have another shot. See? It's good now. So, let me pay you guys. You look familiar. We do business before? Never met. Well, I don't like this. There's something about you that's off. - You patted him down good,yeah? - Yeah. Look, brother, this is good money. Let me pay you and get the fuck out of here. Just hold on to that for a second. He talks like a cop, Dino. That's exactly the kind of entrapment shit a cop would say. What's this? - It's from the man. - No shit. This note's about you. It's not good. Fuck! #Late last night I went to sleep and found myself# Told you I wasn't a cop, bitch. Ruslan. Oh, please, Ruslan. I just finished cleaning after your last visit. You shouldn't have to clean up. What he is doing here? It is... I'm not going to hurt him. Don't worry. Okay? Don't worry. Don't worry. You loved my daughter, right? Why are you asking me that? Well, I see you brought your daddy. Ruslan. - Misha, Misha, Misha. - You're back. If I said it's good to see you again, I would be lying. Please, sit now. And you, my son... You still recognize me. I suppose I should be grateful. Sorry about Katya and your daughter. Can't even imagine how bad you must feel now. And Stephan... He's very sad over... Yeah, I'm sure he's sad. Well, I do really hate to go away from here thinking... in any way you can blame my son for whatever that scum did to your family. I've come here for a reason, and that is... I feel that, uh, you have to come with me to get revenge. - I told you I'm not a gangster. - Yeah, but listen. You don't have to be a gangster... to take revenge when someone kills your wife or your child. This is what any real man would do. - What do you have in mind? - Take a ride. Ask some questions. Look around. See what I can see. That's the Ruslan I remember. And what if you come up dry? I'll leave. Take my daughter's ashes and go. You and I... We were raised by the same code. Don't forget that. He has to do this. If he's a real man, he has to do it. Get the hell out ofhere. Ilya... Said you're never gonna be back. We had a deal. You know, life is a funny thing. No one can tell what the future will bring. We had a deal, Mikhail. Apact. Now you're here. After everything, you treat me with no respect, huh? Respect? You have to earn this. Remember who you're dealing with. Let's go. Follow them. Be ready if I call. Mind your manners. Forget about him. What the fuck is going on here between you guys? I just don't believe it. Let's talk about it. Talk about what? Talk about old times. About Ruslan. And how you're going to help me kill this cocksucker. Yeah... No, bring it. Over here. Where are we going? I'm looking for a wedding ring. - You know this guy? - Sure, I know him. I pay his daddy money once a month. I'm gonna get a refund? We're looking for a ring. It probably came in last night. Do I know you from somewhere? He's a white guy with a tattoo on his neck. - Probably thought it was... - Real valuable, yeah. At first glance, it does. But if you study the stone up close, it's flawed. - Low carats. - Yeah, maybe no value to you... but to some people could be very important. You're saying they broke in to steal your ring? You know, this is the way you follow things. Through something like this,you might find who you're looking for,you know. Yeah. So, let me ask you again... The white guy with the tattoo on his neck... This is a pawn shop, pal, not an information booth. You know, somehow I feel... like you talk a little too tough. Get the surveillance tape. Oh, God.! Where are you? They just came out of a pawn shop on Wade. Ruslan was holding a ring box. Stephan seemed fine, but I heard screams inside. What should I do? Stay with them. Ruslan so much as takes a shit, I know about it. We'll be done with this fucker soon. What if he spots me? You think he hasn't already? Did you hear the address he gave me? Just the projects. South tower. No apartment number. Believe me, we won't need one. - What's going on? - We have to make the cockroaches come out... and then we catch them. Jesus! What's going on? - Big guy, green coat. Go! - Think that's the cops? I'm not staying long enough to find out. What if there's all these guards with guns? Don't get shot. And stay behind me. Keep low and stay close. Down the hall.! This fucking guy is crazy! Let's get outta here! Go! Go! - The girl in the mansion... - Ah, shit! That was my child. - Now, was this a robbery? - Ah, shit! Or someone paid you to do this? Just so you know, asshole, I wasn't there. But I wish I was. She'd have died a lot slower. You know what my next question was gonna be? Does he know you? You think that I... And then, if I liked the answer, it was gonna be... "Who sent you?" I fuckin' loved her, Ruslan. At least I was there. We need information. Now we have fucking nothing. I never killed anyone before. You don't think I was gonna kill him when I got the information? Pick up your fucking gun! Learn to respect the tools of your trade. Let's go. Stephan and the old man are heading east. Da, da. The kid's doing fine. I'm on my way. Da. I got the message too late. I'm at the place. Where you at? You took the fucking wedding ring? Tell me you weren't that stupid! No. Look, you said to take whatever was lying around and make it look like a robbery. - And now my son's out there playing vigilante. - I know. Because I lost one of my men. And if things went to plan, Stephan was the one who killed him. What? Plan? Always easy the first time out if you're convinced they deserve it. No, wait, wait, wait. You hired us to be the ones... Killers I got! This was about revenge. About my son becoming what he had to be. And for this, you need something to hunt down, something to kill. So, what, we were fucking bait? God! Ruslan would have searched your dead junkie friend. What would he find? You watch TV? That's what they call a reenactment. You sleazy here? Point me to him, okay? Let me finish this. Let me finish this. I swear to God I'll finish this. You better not screw this up. Because I know where he'll be tonight. Let's go. Going somewhere? Jesus, Mickey, you scared the hell out of me. - I asked you a question. - I just got off the phone with the cops. They were asking questions about four dead gun dealers. One of their cell phone logs says I phoned at the time they were killed. - I'm going to Aruba till you handle this. - The fuck you are. It's your wife's funeral tomorrow. Cops will be suspicious if you don't show. Please, Mickey. That guy will kill me... with the fucking grave shovel and bury me in front of the priest. - You don't know what he's capable of. - Oh, yes, I do. We're from the same neighborhood. And that's why I know his next move. - We have leverage. - Fuck leverage. I'm gonna kill everything he loves before I kill him. But it's a two-way street. I can't afford to miss or be distracted by the cops. So, you go to that funeral. And Stephan? #If this could happen to you # #Wake up in a dream and everything is coming true # #Hittin'every green light Lady Luck's been on my side # #Every station in the nation plays my song tonight # #One more time 'cause I'm not satisfied # #It'll never get much better Just enjoy the ride # Stevie. Give me a kiss. How's your dad? Did you get married yet? Just one time before I met Lanie. Yeah, yeah. One time. Right. Make sure she put them in the back room, okay? #Monday And I still got the blues # #Goin'nowhere You know I've been there I'm tired of payin'my dues # #Adouble shot of courage won't make it go away # #But one day, baby one day maybe # #It could happen to me ## Is it supposed to feel like this? Losing someone? Killing someone. Well, there's two kinds of people... Those without a heart maybe even enjoy it. They don't feel nothing. People like you and me... for us it never gets any easier. But we'll always have our reasons. Then what are we doing here? As you know, this is a place that has lots of interesting bad guys. And even though we're looking for them... I have a feeling they're also looking for us. So... probably we don't have to wait too long. Huh. Ruslan is in the back. - Mikhail said that if the kid doesn't come out of here alive... - I only got two ears. Oh, yeah, with some brains between too. What are you doing? Stretching. Ruslan! I got orders to take you to a meeting. Quietly. See? No guns. Knives, they don't make any noise, you know. I've never been someone who could, uh, run from a knife fight. Come on.! Kill the motherfucker.! Your dad's waiting out back. What's my father doing here? Oh. Oh, you didn't know. It was your dad who left you alone at the altar. Now go. Come on, man! Move it.! Move it.! Stephan, get in the car. I can explain. We didn't want any harm coming to her. It was an accident. She was collateral damage. - Stay out of my life! - Get in the fucking car, Stephan! - Oh, my God.! - This way.! Come on.! We're out.! Hurry up.! Let's get out ofhere.! - Hurry.! - Freeze! - Freeze.! In here.! - Over here.! - Put down the knife! Drop it! - Nobody move.! Pawn shop owner got himself beat badly. Two guys. One ring. Sounds like gay marriage. Dead body at the projects. Have you been spending any time on my daughter's case? The bouncer went crazy. All right? I guess he thought I should be stuffing dollar bills down his G-string. He's the guy that killed my buddy. What about this guy, Ruslan? He's a hero. Hmm. Your ear... How'd that happen? Wasn't the first club we hit. You write books, Ruslan? Hmm? They don't have your name on them, but they sure sound like you. "FrankieJ. trembled, his palm wavering across those last milk shake cups... "thinking of that hidden spike as if it wasn't just chance at play, but cruel fate. "And his friend's voice goaded him across the table... 'You want to be a tough guy?"' Everybody want to be a tough guy. But nobody want to pay the price. What, you couldn't talk Ilya out of it? He needed another hole in his head? I don't know anything about that. I think we're done here. I could charge your client with murder right now. More than one. Oh, sure, when you come up with a witness with the balls to actually testify... or a dead body in a strip club who a jury doesn't think deserves killing... we'll trade phone calls. You want me to sign the book? Maybe later. So, what'd you get? What do you think? Same B.S. you got. Goldstein got Ruslan out for one reason and one reason only... so Mikhail could finish thejob killing him, and we're going along with it. This is bullshit. Well, in case you haven't been keeping score of the body count, my money's on Ruslan. - You suck. - You just hate it when I'm right. She knows more than she can prove... but they're going to be watching you from now on. And the guys from the strip club? - I sprung them a couple of hours ago. - Uh-huh. You know that guy you sent me to, uh, to buy those things? He got a phone call while I was there and then started to act very strange. - So he has mood swings. What do you want me to do? - Nothing. I took care of it. Good. Fine. I'm in the parking lot across the street here. Have you seen Stephan recently? - Why? - No reason. I haven't seen him around. You think Stephan had something to do with it? Why? Mikhail Abramov. You know him? Yeah. He was a client once. Double homicide. He walked. Warm, friendly guy? Cold as ice. You mind driving? I've got to make some calls. Let me ask you something. When Lanie told me that she met Stephan in court... was she representing him? You really didn't stay in touch, did you? No. I'm kind of a dinosaur. Catherine never said too much about what you knew. Well, I think that's maybe because she didn't trust you. At least she married me. - I gave her more than you ever could. - You think? Oh, and Lanie and Stephan? She was prosecuting him. She had joined the district attorney's office. She said she was sick of people getting away with murder. What is that, some kind of family in-joke? Yeah, and she was going to marry the son of a big-time gangster. How did Mikhail feel about that? Concerned. - He hated the idea of his son marrying your daughter. - Yeah. Who do you think it was that tried to talk Stephan into changing his life? Lanie. And Catherine? Made a lot of bad investments. Junk bonds mostly. And I had a lot of debt with Stephan's dad. She was going to blow the whistle on me and all my side deals. So you decide to have them killed... so you wouldn't have to go to jail. Yeah. That and the big insurance policy I took out on her should take care of all my problems. You know, I have a feeling... your troubles are just beginning. There's another car across the lot. Now you're going to take it slow and easy. Move. Why don't we just do this thing right here? No, we've got better plans for you. Look, if I don't kill you, he will. Well, how the fuck are you going to do that with your eyeballs bouncing off the fucking cement? Mikhail knows you guys are expendable. ...from the Gulag. That's it. - Ready for lunch? - I'll let our people know. Thanks. We gotta go. Shots fired in the garage on 12th. - One guess who's involved. - Let's go get him. Get up... All right. He's with me. Let him pass. What the hell is so important... we couldn't talk over the phone? You looking for a free meal? This is serious shit, Mikhail. I wouldn't be here unless it was. Better be. You get paid to keep your eyes open, not to socialize. Relax. We're among friends here. Go ahead. The girl... the one from the Goldstein house. She's alive. That is news. The kind that could fuck a perfectly good day. Thanks. This doesn't feel right. You think Goldstein had anything to do with what went down in the parking garage? - You think he set Ruslan up? - I don't know. Something doesn't fit. Where's the groom that isn't to be? Maybe we should ask Ruslan that. Of course we'd have to find him first. The question is, would I want to? You saw what they did to his women. Pretend it was your kid. Just so you know, I'm not the only guy in a blue suit thinking this way. Justice is served by... Justice is served by making sure the right people are punished for their crimes. You don't hear me complaining. You're going to write me a ticket, Sam? Stephan, please calm... Don't... Don't do this. Only four people in that room heard Lanie say that Ruslan's ring was valuable. You don't know what I've... You're the only one who could have told them where to find it. This is murder. You will do hard time. Not if I get a good lawyer. Lanie would not have wanted this for you. Hello. - You asked me to call if there were any changes. - Is there a problem? Well, the police officer at the end of the wing, he's not there anymore. Listen to me. Immediately you move her now. You take her where no people would be. - You understand? - There's an abandoned wing. I'll move her there. We need to go to the hospital immediately. - The hospital? - Lanie's alive. - You've got to be fucking kidding me. - I don't joke about my daughter. Now, Mr. Goldstein, you better pray... none of your friends get there before I do. People said you left this life behind. You hurt me, you fall right back into it. I'm way back already, believe me. - All three are inside. We've been watching. - Cops? No. No one tailed them from cemetery. And no drive-bys since. - Police response time? - We can draw the two patrol cars to the far edge of town. We're having some of our people dial 9-1-1 and report an officer down. That leaves the units from Dickerson Station. Peak hour on Central Avenue. Even with their sirens, that gives us 10 minutes at least. Will 10 minutes do it? I want that son of a bitch and his daughter killed. We'll get it done. Who cares if real cops show up? By the time they figure out who we are, they'll be dead. - This isn't going to be surgical, boss. - You think Ruslan would be? lfhe comes gunning for me, pull the car around back. Might buy ourselves some time. You're not gonna believe this. The answer has been under our noses the whole time. - Spit it out, already. - The other guy, Goldstein... he took out a life insurance policy on his wife just before she was killed. - Let's bring him in. The question is, where is he? - Right. Shoot anybody that comes through the door. Your father and his men are on their way. Don't leave my daughter's side, no matter what you hear. Uh-huh. Please... just let me go. I'll turn myself in. You know... I have a bullet for you waiting. - I thought you said we had more time. - We'll handle it, boss. Stephan isn't to be hurt. Get all the people in the I.C.U. and move 'em out here. - This way. This way. - Let's go. Let's go. There's nothing to be worried about. I.C.U.'s all clear. Let's go. Hurry. Help me push this against the door. Officers on scene at East Lawn Hospital. - We've got company. - Watch your back. Come on, folks. We'll have you back in the building in just a couple of minutes. Thanks a lot. Hey, guys. - Go, go, go.! Hurry up.! - This way.! Somebody call somebody now.! Kill him! Go find him! Go! Go! Get the girl! Go! This way! I.C.U. is right up here. Shh! Listen. Please. Please. Just... Just let me go. Not until you pay for what you've done. We gotta go up the stairs now! Let's go! Move! Go. Ambush! Kill this motherfucker.! Shoot the tank! Kill him! Go! Go! Go! What's happening? She's not here. Someone tipped them off. Piece of shit cop work for both sides. Find me this fucking girl! Help me move this back. Where is she? - I don't understand. - The girl that was in that room. The daughter of Ruslan... where is she? Hurry, Doctor. You do not have much time. Yes, Detective Norden. It's Ruslan. Got shots fired, East Lawn Hospital. I'll let our people know. Thanks. Ruslan's already there. They're impersonating cops. Well, why don't we wait and let him kill everyone and then just show up and sign the paperwork? Mm-hmm. This motherfucker can shoot through anything. That's your father. He'll explain everything. - Nothing could explain this. - I'm not the bad guy here! I didn't pull the trigger! You might as well have. Alex is dead! He's got me pinned! Go, go, go! Go! Clear.! We'll split up here. Yes, Detective Norden, it's Ruslan. I'm at East Lawn Hospital. There's been an ambush here by several people impersonating police officers. Go. You hear me? - Mikhail.! - Shut up, motherfucker. This is Ruslan. Listen, there's been an ambush here... with several people impersonating police officers. You can tell who is the bad guy... by the fact that their detectives wear patrolmen shields. Listen, there's been an ambush here. Huh? You are nothing.! And she is good as dead! You really think I would mix my blood with yours? Show yourself, Ruslan. Come and fight like a man. You have your rules, I have mine. I don't care whose game we play. I just care about who gets to walk away to tell the story. Fuck you and fuck your story. Now you're going to die. Let's see you walk away from this. - Let's go.! Let's go.! - Get to the O.R. now.! - My father? - He's dead. I'm sorry for the grief he caused you. Me too. Look. Take him the fuck out of here. - Fuck that. - No, Stephan, please! No... No. You don't act like me. And you don't act like your fucking father. You want to marry my daughter? Behave the way she wants you to. Now get him out of here. Oh. Wake up, my daughter. Daddy, I love you. - There they are. Got it? - Yeah, we got it. Let's go. Move it out. Terry Goldstein,you are under arrest... for solicitation to commit murder, murder and racketeering. Now turn around, please. You're going for a ride. Cops are on their way up. Stephan. Make my daughter happy. Da. Hi. Hello? Hi, Daddy, it's me. Stephan and I just got back from our honeymoon.
