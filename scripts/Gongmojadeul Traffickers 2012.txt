The stomach doesn't work at will, you know? If somethin'goes in, it pumps out acid to digest. "We will soon be arriving."

For VIP patients who need organ transplants, victims' organs have been removed on ship for money. Culprits were arrested in China for illegal organ trafficking. I'll be out before this is out of fuel. Got that? The gang that illegally delivered organs for transplant conspired with a big hospital doctor for the past 7 years. It turns out that they're specialized in rare blood types and heart transplants. The victim is Ms. Yoon from Incheon. The crime has been thoroughly schemed for 3 years. It began from Ms. Yoon's car accident. Later, suspect Lee used his insurance agent status to deliberately approach Yoon. To avoid suspicion, Lee even married Yoon. Kim transported the organs. He delivered the organs to a Chinese hospital for years. Also involved in a murder 3 years ago, Kim has been on probation. The police detained broker, Kang, and Kim suspecting there are further victims. However, they have not enough evidence and expect a stormy case. Oh Sang-jin, MBS News.
