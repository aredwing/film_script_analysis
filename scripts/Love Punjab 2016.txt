Parghat. - Hi, Parghat. - Hi, Julia Very confident. - How old are you? - Seven. Papa, you shouldn't ask girls their age Fine. I understand what you are up to. Bye, Parghat. Bye, Julia Get this straight. She is okay as a friend. But you will be marrying into the Jat community. I am so lame! Your father seems very nice Yeah, but my mom is getting divorced from him Oh, so you'll have a new father then? Yeah Well, what kind of a father do you want? Depends on mom. I hope he will be good But I like Parghat. Wait, dear. He'll be here soon. - Hi, sir. - Hello. Hi. Sorry, I am late I have to drop off the kid. What's new in that? Hold on, I just came. Let me at least settle. We will fight in a while. Sorry. Yes? Well, these are petty tiffs. Why don't you sit together and resolve them? You are absolutely right, sir. Anyway, one person alone cannot bring up a child. What say? I will manage The child isn't as troublesome as he is sir. He is, sir. One child is as troublesome as six women are. Tell me something. What problem do you have with him? Sir, this is what I keep asking as well. What is the problem? You try asking her. Perhaps she might tell you. Really? You don't know? I will know only if you tell me Problem One: I think you two don't communicate with each other. Unnecessary communication gap. Exactly After a few years of marriage, ask him.. ...did he ever spend quality time with me? It's not so, sir. We talked a lot in the beginning. But slowly we released how each other is. We ran out of topics Now what should I talk about, sir? I come home tired. I just wish to have a drink or two and go to bed. I have to go to work the next day. Hence, I go out to spend time with my friends. Then why don't you spend that time with me instead? Because of them, you forgot my birthday this time. I didn't forget, sir. I came home lame by two hours How can I forget her birthday? I wouldn't have become a resident if she wasn't born. So, was our love a lie? Was it because you wanted to become a permanent resident? It's not so, sir. When I saw her for the first time, I thought she is beautiful. Okay? Then I learnt that she is a permanent resident. I thought I should give it a try. What's the harm if we manage to click? But I truly loved her after marriage. I swear by plumbing, sir. Let it be. It's done now. I now know. All the problem is solved. He got married to me to become a permanent resident. What problem do we have now? What is the harm in that, sir? Look, when people get married in Punjab.. ...elders get together and discuss it through, right? They see what the girl does. The girl has a government job. She is had done BEd. She's a teacher. What does the boy do? He is working in a bank So, let's get them married. Now my parents are not here So here, I am going to decide who I am going to marry, right? So, I saw that she's a permanent resident and got married to her. What is the harm in that? I didn't care if she has a government job There's a point in than, dear. Oh please, that's enough. Actually, it is my fault. My mother told me that he is getting married to me for permanent residence. You will face trouble later in life. Then why didn't you listen to your mother? I had fought with her. Look at that, sir. She fights with everyone Just a few moments ago, she said that's enough to you. It's a different case that you didn't mind it. Moreover, your mother isn't good in giving advices. She comes up with a new one every day, sir. Everything that she said turned out to be true She had told me, he would never take me to parties. If he does you'll be sitting with the ladies. ...and he will be sitting with the men And if he ever takes you to shopping. ...then he will multiple everything with 50. Ask him. That's what he does Listen to me, sir. When my father sent me here, he had multiplied by 50 and sent me, right? Secondly as she spoke about the party.. She doesn't fit into my social circle The clothes she wears.. Sometimes they are so thin.. We use thicker clothes than that to cover bread in our village. Then why don't you get a better understanding of your culture? Why don't you go in your Bhangra costume to fix the taps? Conservative thinking Conservative what? - I am conservative? - Yes, you are He has stopped giving me time. Hence, I too got busy in my friend circle. If my friends come over to meet me or if I go to meet my friends. Oh God! He sulks for four days Hold on, sir. You tell me Wives don't need to have friends, sir. My mother doesn't have a friend. My mother never said.. "Your father doesn't spare time for me." "I went to my friend Nazar Singh's house." "Nichchatar Singh showed up there." "We kept chilling till 12:00am" Listen, don't talk about your mother.. ...forget about the past and move forward. If you keep talking about the past then you won't be able go forward. You are right. You are absolutely right. I'll let it go. Let's go ahead. I am done. I want a divorce. Thank you. Bye This is what I want as well, sir. I came here just because of Manveer. Tell him not to talk about Manveer. Does he even know in which grade Manveer is? How much did he score in his last exams? Have you ever gone to his parent-teacher meeting? I have been looking after Manveer so far. And I will do so in the future as well. Giving birth doesn't make anyone a father. Don't use him and attempt a patch up. I am done with him What do you think, sir, will she come back? She will. If she is angry, it means she wants to come back. But after teaching you a lesson. But even if the wife leaves what difference does it make? Let her go. The world doesn't come to an end. If someone old leaves the world, someone new enters. Best of luck. God bless you. Let it be Let her do whatever she wants to. She is no longer related to me anyway. He might be just a friend. There's no use asking If I ask, she will say he's her friend. It's not like she will accept it. Forget it. You can't be bothered about the whole world. You better live your own life lf l ask her whom she was with, she says I am suspicious. She wants a divorce. I will give her 5-7 divorces. You can divorce her later. First, do the job in hand. This is where I have been going wrong so far. I have been only concentrating on work until now. I kept working hard and slogging. I kept paying the mortgages. I kept paying the bills. Why are you wearing the gloves Whom are you going to operate on? - Check the wiring. - Okay. Tell me something, sir. If I couldn't give time at home because of work then what is the problem? I think one shouldn't get married at all. What say? Don't cross wire the fitting in your fit of anger. Don't talk about work. It is my bread and butter. I survive because of this. My job is always perfect. Sharp. Very Sharp- Amazing Great. Do you want to check it, sir? Yes Let's go. 100 dollars, sir. What? Can't you change it a little? I can only change the flow. Do you want me to change it? Here you go. - Let's go. - Coming Let's go. Bro! Bro! Bro! You took money from me just yesterday. I don't want money. What do I need for? Then? - Are you divorcing your wife? - Yes. Then she will be available, right? What do you mean? I mean, if you fix her up with me.. I will get permanent residency. How? She will stay in the family. It will be your house. You can do whatever you please. There will be no problem from my end. Whenever you want to meet Manveer. Whenever you want. You can do whatever you want. - Just one condition. - I want to take divorce from here.. ...and not revenge. You shouldn't be so courageous The village is yet to set up and the beggars are already here - Bro! Bro! - Yes. At least pay me You can take it tomorrow. And then why do you want to be permanent? Getting married will only make you impermanent. She will keep insulting you before others. If you ever talk about this again then I'll pull your ears. Don't call out after I leave How can he please anyone? If his friend isn't happy with him how will his wife be happy? Leave What are you waiting for now? To kill me? Hey Julia, why are you friends with him? He's such a freak. Why don't you go back to India? Let's go, Julia Why didn't you react? I've seen lots of things in my life But now these things do not affect me Very mature. Hey! What's up? No, Facebook? You are funny. It's very cold today. The weather here is unpredictable. It keeps changing like a chameleon. It was absolutely clear in the morning And then it snowed. I have been noticing since the past few days. You stay quite busy on the phone. I don't have anyone else Whom do I talk to? You will know if you lift your eyes off the phone. There are many people you can talk to. - Really? - Yes. - Are you from Pakistan? - Yes. Lahore I guessed it right. I am from Amritsar. We are neighbors. I never knew. We have been staying close to each other from quite some time Yes Are you married? Yes Oh, sorry. - Actually, I am a divorcee. - Oh, wow. I mean even I am going through a divorce. - Oh. So sorry. - You are a divorcee I too am a divorcee. - Too many divorcees, don't you think? - Yes. Mr. Peter's whole family.. It's very common these days. So what caused it? I mean what was the reason? Nothing much. He was very conservative It's the same with me. - My wife was very conservative. - Really? She used to ask me to wear Bhangra costume and go for plumbing jobs I was kept busy with marriage and work - Okay. - I never made friends Oh. What are you doing in the evening? Nothing I am going for shopping After that, I am free. Then. Dinner? - Sure. - Okay. We will make it at my place. - Your place? - Yes. Do you know how to cook? Look Canada teaches you only two things How to earn and how to cook Really? - See you later then. - Yes. - Bye. - Bye. Drive carefully There's a lot of snow. - Yes - A lot of accidents happened today. Okay. Black ice.. I am sure you know. - The car skids sometimes. - Yes Okay. Sure. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. Keep driving. Auntie, make a large one for me I know, darling. Come on, Jessica It's not a big deal. It's a misunderstanding. Such things keep happening in every family. Just get over it. At least for Manveer's sake. Look at him. There is a vast difference in the way he thinks and Parghat thinks This is the difference of basic education. I had told you, the guy should be a Canadian. But you didn't get me. You won't find anyone like Zora I am sorry, Zora I took your name without asking you. Oh God, mom. Please We are just friends So what? Can't friends become husband? If a friend can become a husband.. ...then it will end all the enmity in the world. Auntie, we went to school together'. I never saw Jessica in that way. Then grow up, man. You can do that now. Mom, please I am really sorry. You have to stop this. Anyway, I want to give Parghat another chance Chance? What is wrong with you, Jessica? Met take advantage of this very weakness. Look at me I too took a divorce. Next day I was completely happy. We haven't given birth to them that we cannot leave them Take a divorce and end the topic. - Am I right, auntie? - Absolutely. You know it is not so easy for me Fine, I don't know whether he ever loved me. But I loved him Just. Just a chance and.. I am sorry. You are standing at the shore, what sorrows hold you back? Go on, I am still drowning. I haven't drowned as yet. Good. Amazing My sister is amazing. My sister is a great poet. Amazing Superb. Fantastic. She is wounded. She is hurt. What do you mean? - I mean the man she married.. - Yes. Her husband wasn't permanent. God bless my wife. She said we will settle ourselves in Beijing later. First let us settle down sister. We caught the next flight and came here. Brother; this might be a little personal but what brought you two together? Okay. It's a very long story but I will make it short and tell you. One day I was wondering in the streets of Beijing in the middle of the night. - Ok. - Four goons surrounded me. I don't know from where she showed up. She hit me black and blue I said, don't hit me, save me. You need to hit them Then from the bottom of my heart I said. Oh What? - Do you know what it means? - No. Not at all. I love you. You need to say it to someone else. Not to her. Have some kebabs You look weak. Your plane is also empty. Take some Someone is giving special attention to someone. Brother! You cooked good food. Whatever you say.. The food cooked by my sister smells like Lahore. Amazing The food from Lahore and Amritsar smell the same, brother. Not just the smell. People are also the same. The same villages, the same streets. The same language, the same youth and the same childhood. Brother, don't make me recall my childhood. Those sweet memories of my childhood. Sour berries, sweet mangoes Sweet breads. - And a mother sweet scolding. - Amazing. Brother, too much sweet. It causes worms. Worms! What have you just reminded me of! Worms! You guys too get them? Of course Worms don't have a religion, caste or country. She too must be getting them. Eating sugar.. Everyone gets them In the childhood kids get worms.. Everyone is the world worries A mother worries the most. She keeps trying to find a treatment. Father will go behind you with his slipper. "Now dare you eat more sugar!" So true, brother. Now look, there is so much happening in life. ..But there is no one to worry about us I have decided that I will make some money and go back to my country. I am not going anywhere. I am Canadian. Brother, loneliness kills one. If you find the right companion is such countries" ...then one starts enjoying the place. Bro, you can look at the photographs later. Please give me a helping hand. I am getting lame. I need to go back and do the laundry. Okay. I am coming after sending this message Do you know any emotional poetry? The ones one sends on anniversaries etc. Whose it is? Mine. I want to send her a nice message. You will send a message to your wife? Where is that person who used to say I don't care about anyone? "She can do whatever she wants" "She can go wherever she wants." Beer has lost its fizz? I sometimes say things I don't mean, you know that. Let me send her a message. She will be angry if I don't send one This is a little different, a little emotional. Read it. Fill it the glow and let's get out of her. Okay, so you are messaging Parghat. Why not? Continue. Go ahead. Tell him, "forgive me, I made a mistake" "I will die without you" "Who will take care of me" I have another idea. Write a letter to him in your blood "I am your slave." okay, okay, okay. Stop. I was only asking about Manveer. I know you are asking about Manveer. Students, I have this exciting project to announce today. The family heritage project. I always look forward to this every year. It gives us a chance to talk about where we come from. So, I will give you an example. My father's from Canada, but my mother actually comes from Scotland Canada is a multicultural country. And we have a lot of different people come from a lot of different places. So, I'd like for you to include facts and photographs Getting facts off the internet is very easy. Manveer, your project is going to suck. There is nothing good about your country. Thank you. You are right, brother. You are absolutely right. Just kidding, brother. Here you go. Sister-in-law has made it. This is my wife's favorite food. - Only a little. - Take it. - That's enough. - Try it. Try it. Eat it. - What was this? - This? Cockroaches with onions. - Sorry. Sorry. - He must have got an onion. It would have tasted delicious if it were a cockroach. - You too eat some. - No, I don't eat it. I don't touch such things. I am into greens and bread. I too am into greens and bread. Greens and bread reminds me of Punjab. Punjab reflects in everything you say. You can remove someone from Punjab.. But you can never remove Punjab from a person. You are being so poetic. Amazing It will be quite a pair when two poets will get together'. Listen. Manveer? What happened to him? Oh, history of Punjab. Let's read it together. - Punjab has a great history and.. - Kids said that Canada isn't my country. I want to go to Punjab. You got influenced by kids? So many intelligent people told me and yet I didn't believe them. It is such a beautiful country. We won't leave it just because people ask us to. This is the problem. Those kids insulted me. They said that my country is bad. Okay. Insult. You know son, insult is just like cold. The more you think about it the more you feel it. I want to go to Punjab That's it. Fine, we will go in the morning. Go to sleep now. Now should I go to Punjab or the counselor's office in the morning? Or should I go get the tissue as we ran out of them. Oh. I need to also fix a flush urgently. Hey Tuti, you are not up as yet? Who will switch off the alarm? Why should I switch it off? I don't want to go to school. What? I don't want to go to school. Oh! That's more like it! Today I realized that you are my son and I am your father. You know I didn't complete my education I will take you to school by your ears. I don't want to go there. - You will go there for sure. - No, I don't want to go there. Okay, bye. Study well. Your mother will come to pick you up. Okay? Bye-bye. Hi. - Oh hi, how are you? - I am very well. I am sorry, I can't find Manveer. Do you know where he is? He didn't come to school today. He.. he didn't come? No. No. I haven't seen him. Thank you. No problem - Everything okay? - Yeah. Manveer! Manveer! What are you doing over here? What are you doing over here? You know how scared I was? - You didn't go to school? - No. - Does your father know you are here? - No. Let's go. He couldn't take care of his child for 15 days "Don't mix up love with a fake friendship." "lf you don't wish to give a hug then don't even shake hands." Beautiful. Very beautiful. - It's very deep too. - Not so much. Now your turn I had brought a book from the bus stand in India There was a good one in it. "I cannot tell my father, mother, you cannot keep it hidden." No, this wasn't in the book. It was something else I thought so. "I cannot tell my father, mother, you cannot keep it hidden." "They say I am just a kid, pampered by my parents." "I wish to get married, mother.." I won't be able to say it. You go ahead with yours. No. It's okay. Go ahead. - No, you recite good ones. Go ahead. - No. - You. - No, you recite one - You. - No, you recite one You.. - No, you recite one - You recite one. Sorry, sorry. I think I am interrupting No, brother. No. Have a seat. Brother; your kitchen is in a bad state. A house without a woman and a woman without a house are useless. Am I right? If there is a bulb switch on at home.. ...and there is no one to switch it off, then it is not far. Didn't I say wrong? I think you two are feeling shy. It's okay. You carry on I will look away. No brother, sit. Why are you making him feeling uncomfortable? Just kidding, sister. Tell me, did you recite that one.. "Don't look at me with such passionate eyes." "Otherwise, I am sure to die." You are.. Who are you? Didn't they teach you to knock before entering? - Are you new here? - My wife. You didn't tell me about her. Sister, put your feet down. Hello. Hi. Do you know where Manveer was? Yes he had gone to school. I dropped him off to school in the morning. - Why? - You don't need to pretend I thought you are just not concerned about me. But I didn't know that you aren't concerned about your child either But I dropped him to school.. In your life, everything is about you. Your life, your happiness You don't deserve a relationship, Parghat. Enjoy your company. She is my friend's sister. They are my friends. I have come to talk to you for the final time. I know that you like Jessica Then what is the problem is getting married with her? Without sugar. I love her. But I don't want her family life to be disturbed. Anyway, she considers me as her friend. If I talk about the wedding, then it won't look good. I have no problem. I am ready to marry Zora "I feel scared at night." "My eyes seek light." "I will be happy." "I will be happy." "Just look at me with a smile" "Keep this apple of your eyes in your heart." "Keep this apple of your eyes in your heart." Okay, I'll do it. Just get out of my whole life. Manveer! "Mom, I am used to sleeping in your arms" "Papa, I am used to sitting on your knees" "Mom, I am used to sleeping in your arms" "Papa, I am used to sitting on your knees" "I haven't seen God." "I haven't seen God." "You should side me." Be brave, son. India is a really good country. And your parents they are really nice Right? I think your child is suffering from depression. He thinks this isn't his country anymore. And after your divorce, his father too will be separated from him. Hence, he thinks he can no longer look into his friends' eyes. It happens. Kids are sensitive Hence, both of you will need to take good care of him Fine. If you two cannot be together then can you do this? Take him to India and show him that his country is a beautiful one. He is a good boy. You are right, doctor. But do we show its beauty? We can show beauty only if it is beautiful, right? Don't you see the news? Or don't you have a Facebook account? Look, you will have do it. I can try. Let it be. He is in depression over here, so over there he'll.. No, India is indeed a beautiful country. It has its own beauty. Yes, it is indeed it has a lot of beauty Like unemployment, bribery.. ..Drugs, traffic, bullets, farmers suicide.. Tell me honestly, doctor". If India was better than Canada.. ..Then would you have come to Canada? Wouldn't you have opened a clinic in your village? Nothing is wrong with him. he is absolutely fine When I was small someone told me that a lizard fell into eaten. ...and someone died after drinking that water. Fearing that I didn't water for quite some time. I was about to die from dehydration Slowly everything went back to normal. He too will be fine He doesn't have much to worry about anyway. My son will be fine, right? Manveer, let's go. Thank you, doctor. - You are welcome. - Let's go. Look, don't lose hope. At least make an attempt towards this. Sure. I'll talk to the prime minister. I'll tell him, my son needs to visit India Please make India better than Canada for a few days Down with - This government. Down with - This government. We will destroy it! Down with - This government. Down with - This government. Hello? Hello, father. Yes? Hello, father. Hello, dear. How are you? Is everyone fine? Hale and hearty? Yes yes. All is fine. - How are you? - Yes? Father, Manveer wants to come to Punjab. My grandson is coming? Brar's grandson is coming? You have added four years to my life by saying than. Come quickly. I say you just come quickly. - But there is a small problem - Yes? Can we somehow show Manveer that Punjab is better than Canada? - Yes? - Father? Can we somehow show Manveer that Punjab is better than Canada? What's happening over there? It's nothing. It's festive time. People are bursting firecrackers. At happened? It hit my bum I'll talk to you later. I need to run! Run? Like you run every day, dear. Now I need to run. Bye. Hit them! Hit them! It is hurting me You! Leave! - Watch out! - It really hit me! Stop scaring me like that! Headman, why did you have to do that protest? I can't help it. I am helpless. I need to be with the people lf I don't then they said that I don't support them. He made my bum hurt. What can I say? We too are helpless. We get strict orders from the headquarters Otherwise, would we want to hit people like you with sticks? Our helplessness always gets the better of us - Here, sign over here. - Give. Where do I need to sign? Take this. Yes, dear? Did you finish your run, father? Yes I am very tired. Don't ask. What were you saying? Punjab what than Canada? We need to show its better. What is wrong with you? 54 rupees is equal to one Canadian dollar. If the rupees keeps rising every year.. ...then we won't be able to compete with it for another 54 years. What are you talking about? No, no, no. This is impossible. I know it is difficult. But Manveer isn't well. We don't know what's wrong They said, he has depression. Someone told him something in school.. He isn't talking to anyone He isn't eating anything. He isn't saying anything. They said that. We will have to take him to Punjab They say that if he doesn't come out of it.. ...then he will face more problems once he grows up. It's okay. It's okay, dear. Don't cry. Don't cry, my child. Don't cry. You shouldn't cry, dear. I will do something I will do something about it. Don't worry. Don't worry. I will do something. Thank you, father. Please try. So, this is what it is in brief. We need to change for good for 15 days. Okay? I shouldn't be saying this I don't want to say it either. No more local brewing. And there will be no loitering around in the streets in a drunkard state. This is my only request. Oh great headman! Just because your grandson is visiting you.. ...you want all the villagers to stop drinking? Is your grandson visiting u; or some prince? You are right. I didn't want to say it but" If it would be great if you can do that. What are you doing, uncle? According to Canada's list, spitting is prohibited. No spitting? Where do I spit then? In his pocket? Or should I sell it in the bank? They can use it to count money. Today you say that I should spit. Next, you will say that I cannot sneeze Then, you will say that I cannot burp Then, you will say that I cannot fan. In this manner, you will stop our innate reflexes He is right as well. Do we wish to stop his innate reflexes? It is a very natural thing Right. He is right. But his manners are wrong. Listen to me. Whatever we do we in front of that kid, we need to be polite. Don't spitting in your fists repeatedly. One more thing Whenever you pass each other, without differentiating.. ..between male and female, you will smile at each other. How can anyone do that! I will behead the one who even looks at my wife! He is right as well. We should behead anyone who looks at anyone's wife, sister daughter'. - He is absolutely right. - Yes. I am your headman I help you when you are in need. Now it is your turn, right? What have you done for us, headman? You have always only stolen from our village You had said that you would install computer in our village Tell me, where are they? - I had said so? - Yes. - When? - Hey, I must have said so in a drunkard state. You are unnecessarily bringing up ghosts of the past. Tell me, what will you do with a computer? Have you seen your face in the mirror, uncle? Do you think you can run a computer? You should be running a bar or something What if you run your computer into someone? Mind your language. I can even make you run, that too without any gears We can no longer be fooled, headman. We won't be fooled by you anymore. We voted for you. What did you do? Tell us. You are just acting stubborn now. What if I say that you took Rs. 1000 to vote for me? Look at me I have noted in my diary. You can ask him. I think none of you are going to listen to me. Let it be. I will talk to Parghat. How can you do that? Listen to me, villagers. If my grandson doesn't come here because of all of you.. ...then I will be your worst enemy. Look into my stomach. I have so many desires! When he will come, he will bite my stomach. If my grandson doesn't come here.. ...then you will find my dead body in front one of your fields. It is also possible that I tear my veil before I die Then don't say that the old hag got two cases on you Have some shame These people respect me. I just saw how much they respect you None of them listened to you If you don't listen to me, how will they listen to me? Be grateful that I stayed with you. You should be grateful that I stayed with you You tell us not to fight when your grandson comes over. But both of you aren't stopping either. Let's go, villagers. Hold on You guys have stooped so low now? Can't you change for good for a few days? You forgot your history. When did you blood turn white? When did your conscience die? You need to wake up conscience. Whenever Punjabis have been in trouble. ...they have come together and fought against it. When warriors and the braves one used to fight, a poet had written" People have the illusion that we are just a handful. Even dead won't be an end to us, we are so many in number. Get together once again. Tell the world that we are no less. Long live. Long live. Lambardar.. get up Let's go. Wait. When I won, I had paid some Rs. 500, some Rs 1000 to vote for me. And in exchange, I had asked for five years from you. Now I ask you for 15 days. And I will pay double the money. From Rs. 2000 to Rs. 5000. Long live Revolution! Long live Revolution! Long live Revolution! Long live Revolution! Yes, we have made our village better than Canada That's great, father. Thanks Just ask Parghat to send me a grant of 25,00,000 or so. Grant? I am the headman here, dear. I am used to asking for grants. Tell him to send me Rs. 25,00,000. I need it. Oh Okay. Okay, father. It's not a problem. We will send it. But try to use it for the village itself. What are you saying, dear? I am the headman for villagers, and not for the family members. Thank you, father. Bye. I will see you soon - Guess what? - What? We are going to Punjab! Oh really? "It is different from all!" "It is different from all!" "Jams hold their pride high." "Young males are going to the fair!" "The sticks on the shoulders clashed." "The sticks on the shoulders clashed." "Now it will cause a storm" "The girls are wearing cleaned slippers" "The girls are wearing cleaned slippers" "And they have a smile on their faces.." "Now the girls dance in a carefree manner!" "Look the chief is on his knees." "Sister-in-law, look Baba Bishana." "Sister-in-law, look Baba Bishana the devil has changed." "Now everyone gets together at the square." "Now everyone gets together at the square." "And everyone is heard." "Now the girls dance in a carefree manner!" - Hello? - Hello, father. Hi, son. How are you? Why do you sound so sad? No, just.. I just felt like talking to you. Oh really? You are really missing me today. Usually whenever I call you, you seem to be in a hurry. What is wrong? Anyway, you are coming day after tomorrow.. Then we will get together and talk - We? - Yes, we I cannot say Canada But we have made something out of it. You can come and take a look at it. Once he meets his grandpa, he will forget Canada and America! Be strong See you. Bye. Let's go, Manveer. Okay, bye- I am doubtful Manveer will get well over there. But you can make an attempt. - Take care of his health - Okay. Your ex-wife Oh wow. What brings you here? Are you too going to India? You too? - No. - Thank God. - You? - Oh God! - Hello, brother. - Hi! Business or economy? It has to be business After all, his uncle is going with him. - I am flying economy. - Are you too going, papa? Yes son. I too am going there. What a co-incidence, isn't it? But brother, you already knew that they were going to India You are going after doing all the planning Planning? Now what is this drama? Jessica, you are not going Mother, I am not going there for fun. You know how many flushes I have to repair? I am going for Manveer. These two won't be able to take care of him. You don't need to worry. I will take care of everything Look, we too don't want him to go with you But I advise you to take him with you God forbid if anything goes bad, he will make it worse I mean he will make it good It's okay, Jessica Don't worry. Moreover, there is one more condition. Actually, it's a request. My family doesn't know that we are taking a divorce Please don't tell them You should be all smiles in front of them - Just a little, not too much. - No. Just sometime; when they are in front of you. Smile a little Brother, if she has your permission she will laugh sometimes. That's okay. But tell them about the divorce Thank you, I will tell them as soon as I get an opportunity Okay, that's enough. We are leaving. Manveer, let's go. Bye. Manveer, I am coming. Balkar Singh's grandson is coming I will expose the drama he has been doing. If I don't expose the truth in front of him then don't call me Gajjan. I don't understand these people. They will keep slogging to death for five years. But during elections as soon as they see the money.. ...they will pee on the spot. Bloody double-tongued scoundrels. I don't trust you guys either. Drink some tea No. After all he is your brother's grandson. What brother? He has always only stolen from our village His grandson is coming here But what about our grandsons? We have kept our grandsons away from our village They have come from the city. Look, there is no charm on their faces Take your tea - Take it, Gurdev Singh. - Give it to me "Come soon, oh my beloved." "My eyes are getting tired of waiting.." "Come back soon." "Come back, my heart eagerly awaits you." "I cannot stay alone anymore." "Alone.." "Waiting for you is killing me" "Waiting for you is killing me" "Waiting for you is killing me" "You have turned my face into stone." "You have turned my face into stone." "Let the eyes shed tears, oh my beloved." "Let the eyes shed tears, oh my beloved." "Oh my beloved!" "Oh my beloved!" "Oh my beloved!" "Oh my beloved!" "My sightseeing is going weak, but the wait isn't over." "Come back at least now." "Come back, I plead to you." "You should know, I am dying." "I am dying." "But this period of separation doesn't seem to come to an end." "But this period of separation doesn't seem to come to an end." "But this period of separation doesn't seem to come to an end." So my brave son, how did you like our Punjab? Amazing - Isn't it better than Canada? This new trend of dancing in the fields. It is absolutely amazing The happy farming of Punjab. - I am sure Obama will hear about this. - Yes. I am sure it must have been your idea Yes brother. It has all been my idea. So Manveer, did you like it? Yes, I really like it. - Like it. - He likes it. How did you like Punjab, dear? I thought it is amazing It's beautiful. I wonder why do people leave this place to go to Canada! Why don't they permanently stay here? Now tell me, how can you stay where you are not destined to stay. - So true. - So true. Parghat, did you miss us over there? You ask if I miss you guys uncle? Only my body has gone there. My heart is still here. Yes he is absolutely right. His heart is still over here. He didn't take it to Canada Stop it now. You are so sweet! They make such a cute couple. They look good together. They make a beautiful couple. My grandson is also very beautiful. He is my grandson. He smells like me. Let me tell you. Hey, as if you smell good. You always stink. She is just joking, son Here son, this is your wedding reception's invite. Wedding reception? Reception? It was not needed, mother. You should give the money to the poor instead. Or you could have gotten group weddings done. You don't want a reception? You got married and settled in Canada I have given around Rs. 2.5 lakhs as gifts. Don't I have a right to recover it? It's a desire, dear. Of the villagers as well as the relatives Yes. Now if everyone is insisting then for how long can we refuse? And then, Manveer is also here He will get a chance to attend his parents' wedding reception. You also complete you wish. What is wrong with her? I think she felt shy after hearing us talk about the wedding reception But the way she got up, she didn't look shy. Now in what proper manner should she feel shy for you? - This is how a tired person feels shy. - True. Let's go home now. Bye. Let's go to the bar then No, I mean the fields. - Let's go. Let's go. - Hurry up Drink it, there's a sip left. Let's go. Stan moving now. Finally. What is this function? It's just like a wedding reception Villagers just eat and have a gala time. I didn't ask for a definition. I am asking for the reason. Why did they keep this party, Parghat? I don't know. I too was surprised to hear about it, Jessica My meal came up from my stomach Oh God. One lentil's dish.. Two dry veggies and chicken That's all people would like to eat. It's no use telling this idiot anything I am going to meet the cook. Okay, okay. You have to stop them. Please Please, Parghat. Just stop them. Well, I will try. But it's not in my hands. It is all your fault. If you wouldn't have insisted on coming here.. ...then they wouldn't have printed the wedding invites It is so difficult for me too. Think about it. I will be sitting with someone's future wife It's okay. We will somehow manage this difficult situation with a smile on our face. Oh please I don't know what have I gotten myself into. She says I felt shy. Don't feel shy, this is your own house She loves me a lot. Look, how much your parents love each other. - Don't they, son? - Yes. The dinner was so tasty, mother. I swear, I was yearning to eat the food cooked by my mother. Yes I didn't cook it, son. My daughter-in-law cooked it. Oh really? But you must have been standing next to her, right? Even a mother's shadow makes the food tasty Yes, son. I was standing close to her. - She is very nice. - Yes. When she came, she said I will do all the household chores. Cooking, handling the dung cakes. Cleaning the utensils. She is very affectionate. - Let's go to bed, son. - Yes. Okay? But we won't let her do it, will we, mother? We will handle it on our own - We won't let her work - No. - And son.. - Yes? I am not like my mother-in-law. Two days after my marriage, she tied her veil on her head She said she is an asthma patient. She stayed alive for another 10 years. Nothing happened to her. She was as healthy as a horse. She was waiting for my mother to die. When we got her eyes operated. ...she had kept the stove right next to her bed. The smoke gave her eyes an asthma attack Oh my mother! Don't teach him bad things. As if she was a good human being. It was only me how managed to survive living with her. And plus you and your family. And plus you and your family. - Shut up. You better shut up - Crazy guy. She was good for nothing and she is finding faults in others. Stop it, father. You are the smart one. Dear, is this how you fight with him? Tell me No. - No. - No. No.. We don't fight. Why will we fight? She is very good. Only fortunate ones get such wives. She doesn't eat till I don't come home Really? - Yes. Yes. - And what about him? Tell me Do you have any complaints against him? Tell him that I too am good. Yes. He is very good He does much more than what a wife expects her husband to do. My son is very nice. But let me tell you something. There are many people here who marry Canadian girls.. ...to get permanent residency. Let me tell you They are very selfish. You are absolutely right, father. - Enough, Jessica - Such boys are very.. What are you guys talking about? Tell him about the time. ...in the zoo when the monkey snatched your ice cream I had scolded the monkey. Talk about good things Happy couples are those who have done good deeds in their past lives. - Enough, enough. - Look at them. Learn something from them Here, garbage down your medicines What do you mean by garbage down? I mean, please have your medicines. Oh so sweet. Such sweetness, I hope you are not offering me poison. Poison won't kill you. - Oh no. - Lovely. You are amazing. What are you saying in front of the kids? Have some shame You have one leg in the grave The legs are in the grave, but my head it still out. You think you are very smart? Drama Papa. I want to go to school. We came to India but you don't go to school. Now you say that you want to go to school. Now do you want me to go to Canada to drop you off to school? Go to sleep. I want to see the school of this village. What? Let me teach a few of them a lesson until they come No, sir. Listen to me.. Let me hit one of them until they come. Both of us will feel better. Use your brains sir. We have to do a drama According to Canadian schooling. ...beaming them up makes them lose their confidence. They are the future of our country. If you teach them properly, our country won't move towards darkness. - They are the future of our country? - Yes. Then what! Think about yourself as well. We have got the grant. You can get a transfer. Country's future, no. They are our future. Right. Stand up, Futures. Today the present saved you. Go on, boys. But how will I teach them without beating them up? No, you cannot beat them up Make them your friends. - WhatsApp madam. - Yes? Listen to him He says make these kids your friends Friends. Yes, of course. They are our friends. This means madam is also our friend? - Your friend...! - Oh it hurts! It's only for a matter of minutes Then it's back to your stick and their hands. - Right. - Okay. Yes Uncle, he has arrived. Let's start. Today's news The government will pardon all the dues of the farmers Punjab overnight become the world's No. 1 state. Peoples from America, Canada and Uganda wants to get settled in Punjab. Wi-Fi free in the whole of Punjab. Wow, they keep the place so clean. They give us a bad name for no reason at all. Everyone reads newspapers and books Good riddance.

Yes I like Canada school. Very intelligent. Yes How many kids know about computers? What do you know about it? - I know. - Ghudda, stand up. Tell us In a computer apart from Facebook there is YouTube as well. In YouTube we can listen to songs. If we find a singer's song to be offensive.. ..Then we came curse them as well. By making a fake profile. I too have a profile. Jinda Jat. - Enough Sit down. - Thank you. Before our friendship take a painful turn, sit down. Okay. So, this is the computer class. Do you wish to ask anything? I think that's enough. Am I right, son? Let's go. Very good Well done, sir. Come on, say bye to him I will come back again tomorrow. This school is very nice - Let it be. Tomorrow.. - He is coming back tomorrow? - Bye. - Fine. Try not to come tomorrow. Carry on, What sap ma'am. So.. YouTube. Stand up, Jinda Jat. I will change your profile. What is this nonsense! Earlier we used find faults in the headman while sitting over here. Look at the politics now. Now that same headman is finding faults in us. He says you should change, yourself for the good. Only then will your village get better. Now did we change the whole village? The headman changed it, didn't he? It is headman's fault. I am yearning to get my hands on a drink What's that, Papa? Hurry up! Hurry up! Get up! Get up! - What is it? - The square. - Quickly start the drama - So as I was saying.. Why is our country ahead of other countries? Is everything set? The reason is that we love our country. We stay together like a family. America, Uganda, Turkmenia all are feel jealousy. It is not what the government will do something for us No. No. We too have some duty. We have to do something for ourselves. If we are hungry then we are the ones who will have to eat. If someone else eats we don't feel sated. Will we feel sated? Am I right, Happy? So, while talking about food. We will have a look at the moon Am I right. Moon is round, just like a circular flat bread. Hey scientist uncle, how you doing? I want to see the Milky Way. Look, we don't talk in English while working. No, son. Actually only those who are above 18 years old.. ...can see through that telescope. Sorry. - Prasabh.. - Yes? - You cannot grow grams on moon. - Why? I heard that there is no.. I have seen. There is no water there If there is no water, then we can grow cotton, right? No, we cannot even grow cotton Because the Americans have already reached there. Come, have a look. Son, I think they will soon shift to the moon. We shouldn't disturb them Let's go, shall we? - Let's hurry up. - Hold on Stop this drama This one who is looking at the moon has never even looked at his uncle. Hello, uncle. Your hello won't stop me from telling the truth, Parghat. Let me tell you. This isn't the real image of Punjab. This is your grandpa's drama What do I tell you, son? Farmers are in a bad state. Groundwater levels are getting lower by the day. Medicines have become expensive. If a man goes out with a rope in his hand.. His wife makes a boy follow him. To know where is he actually going You didn't recognize him, son? He is my uncle who does drama He does street plays to make people aware. ...so that no problem arises in the system You heard his speech? I thought that it was true Look, he thought it was true Your acting is a hit. Amazing Let's go, son. - Let's go. Let's go. - Son, your grandpa is fooling you. All this is a drama He has gathered all idlers at a wage Well done, oh great artist. Well done Did you aunt just danced that you are applauding? Stop it. Show me a nice dress, son. Here auntie This is a very good dress. It is in fashion. Let it be. This looks like a blanket. Show me something nice. Listen show me something that makes the villagers say.. ..Than there is no one like the Brar's daughter-in-law. Okay wait, I'll find one for you. Watch out brother, don't increase the rate after this Don't try to fool us just because we are women. Mother.. Mother, all this is not needed. I will fulfill all my desires. Whenever a boy used to get married in our village. ...l used to feel like throwing myself in front of the car. Now, I will dance in front of your car. "She flew away." "She flew away." Mother! Hold on. Sorry, mother. It's okay. Hi. Hey Jessica, how are you? I am good. How is Manveer? Thankfully Manveer is happy. Okay, that's good. Is everyone fine in Punjab? Oh, Punjab is beautiful. These people are also very nice Listen, your mom is here. 'We all have got together.. I am making plans for my future Yeah. Are you liking it in Punjab? Now don't say that and make her like it. Give it to me Hello Jessica Hello? Hi! Keep Manveer away from the dust and the grim. And stay away from all the black magic They start asking money from foreigners. Keep your fists closed. Anyway, I have blocked your credit card. Come soon. We have a big surprise for you. One more thing Get me a Punjabi sandal on your way back. - Sister, do you want something? - No, thank you. Okay, dear. Okay. Take care. - Come on.. - No. No. - No.. - No, now don't run away. - Drink it. - No, no. You have tired me. Here, drink it. - He won't drink it that easily, mother. - Okay.

I will go crazy playing with them She keeps saying, mother. She also has a child's photo in our room But I refuse. Why, Son? It's not easy to bring up two kids It's more than enough if we bring one up together'. Of Course. You can leave him with us. Son, you should ask God to give you a brother. God answers kids' prayers quickly. No, grandma I want a sister. I want an aunt for my children. - Hey, come here. - Oh God. Hear him talk. He says he wants an aunt for his kids. Don't listen to your father. Take after your mother. - No, no one can be like his mother. - Really? Such people are not born every day. She is better than ten angels put together'. If she wasn't born then I would. How would I become a permanent resident? Let it be, mother. How do I praise her in front of her? When we will sit alone, I will tell you how good she is. - Really? - It is true, mother. I too will tell you how good he really is. Okay, dear. So sweet! They love each other a lot. A lot. Keeping love aside, you shouldn't pamper him Such people end up troubling you. Take his father for example I was newly married. I loved him a lot. I did everything for him. He used to come home drunk at night. And he used to ask me to serve him fresh hot flam breads I used to serve him fresh hot flat breads. Once, late in the night he came home sloshed. He kept roaring. He asked me to serve him fresh hot flat breads. - Then? - I got angry. I don't know what happened to me I think I was possessed. I picked up a small bat, covered my face and started beaming him up I hit him black and blue. Really? From that day onwards. ...he never ever mentioned them. Now when I serve hot flat breads. ...he cools them down and then eats them. - Stop it now. - Great. The Brar family seems very happy today. What's happening? Laughter is echoing in the Brar household today. The whole family is sitting together, father. Tell me what's the reason, dear. I.. Nothing. Why are you laughing? Tell me. Females have so many things to talk about. Now we won't be telling you everything, will we? Let it be father. It won't be anything meaningful anyway. They must be making fun of someone - I know everything. - Quiet. Oh God. Aren't you ashamed of insulting me in this old age.. ...in front of my son and my daughter-in-law? Look dear, how he is threatening me with the bat. Grandma, you two always keep fighting. Why don't you take a divorce from grandpa? He never gives me anything He sold the instruments to buy machinery. He still hasn't returned them. He is a miser. Try me and then you will know. Go and get my medicines. I won't. Live or die, I don't care. Oh my Zeenat Aman, go and get it. Damn you. You flirt with me in front of the kids. - He thinks he is Rajesh Khanna - Get lost. Look son, this is how you can sweetly make woman do your work. Yes Drama My son will sleep with me? Let's go. Okay. So that boys knows better English than your teacher. Lift your bum, son Higher. Sir, if you don't stop punishing us like this.. ...then I will come about you to the headman's grandson. Threats? I will beat your friendship until it is red. Let me tell you Sir, don't punish them till his grandson is here. I cannot eat until I see them punished. So what do you mean now, that I should stay hungry for 15 days? I am going on a leave. Approve my 15 days' leave. I cannot do this drama Friend, get back to your seam. Go and sit down. - Hey teacher; how you doing? - Well. - How's schooling, teacher? - Good.

Manveer is also very happy here. He is much better than before. Father.. You have always fought with mother. But from the time I have come back.. ...l have been noticing that you fight with her a lot. Do you ever feel that you made a mistake by getting married to her? What do you think, I don't know the truth? Have you lost your mind? All the old women are the same. You shouldn't get angry with them, let me tell you. No man can be ever happy with them. Don't tell your father about this sweet. He will start lecturing for no good reason. You know he has already lost his mind. I don't get it, mother. You fight with him all day long. How did you spend so many years with him? This is life What's so special with life otherwise? My aunt's daughter's husband hits her every day. - Oh my God! - She still lived a good life. This means what those sweet talks about love are also fake? What love? Have you lost your mind? Love? That too with that old hag? You should love your friends. - You love your children. - True. But still, even if they have a snake instead of a tongue. They are better off at home All men are worthy of being killed. - Yes. So true - Absolutely. Help me up, dear.

I want to discuss something with you two. - Yes? - Yes? I am having doubts on you two. Did you two have a disagreement or something? We are always smiling and laughing. - Did you? - No. - Oh mother...! - I have never seen you two fighting. Come again? You want me to buy a dress worth Rs. 20000 for the reception? You want two dresses worth Rs. 40,000! I've been going bankrupt from the time I have married you. Talk to me and stop punching me...! Stop punching me! Mother, you better come here and save your son! What are you saying? Please don't ruin my image in front of everyone I don't like this drama. Mother, save your son! - Please! Shut up! Please! - They are fighting! Mother, save your son! Now I am assured that everything is fine - They will make a good couple. - Mother, save your son! Mother! Now I will tell you who is good. No! - She might hit him - They will handle it on their own - Mother, save your son! - Oh God! Smile "I had got matches from big shots near and fan" Your earrings are beautiful.
