What can you do mate? You should have taken caution while you were in emotion. Few days ago, you had bought different flavored condoms. That condoms should not be worn on your head. Rather they should be worn somewhere else. But I have not done it even once without a condoms. Do you think I would do it without a condoms? Who knows, May beJust kidding, mate. I think its a different story. Ok listen! Once a man was walking in the jungle carrying an umbrella. Suddenly, a tiger appeared. That man turned the same umbrella in the direction of the tiger and made a thundering sound(sound of a gun) That tiger immediately fell on the ground. Now tell me how? How? Just give it a try. How can it be possible? Guess, man. Nonsense. RubbishHow can an umbrella fire a bullet? Obviously, No. Someone else must have fired. Exactly, thats my point. Someone else fired.

This Village is haunted by ghosts, evil spirits and bad omen. Oh Really! Moreover, they haunt somebody wearing a red attire in particular. Guys I am telling you to avoid red. I didnt know it.

Look, whos talking. You are the loser. Aakansha, wait. Aakansha! Are they dating? No theyre just friends. I think somebody didnt like my joke. Seven years! I get surprised when I hear such amusing stories. I mean, dont you guys get bored watching each others face continuously? We have been watching our parents for 20-30 years. Seven years is nowhere close to that. Anyways, I must salute you guys. But, How do people stay in a relationship for seven years? How is this possible? They do love each other. Ugh! Theres a fly in the tea, Well, we can only afford a fly in a 10 rupee cup of tea not a bike or a car. Drink your non veg tea. It is very nutritious. Even though you dont have a pretty face, but still you could talk nice. Shit! I am scared. Rishi, Lets go. Lets go. Wow! This is called a view. What happened? Ive been watching you from the very first day I dont like your attitude. Stay away from Aakansha. Or else. Or else What? Or else What? Did you get the answer? Jerry! What happened? Jerry! Stop. Hey, what happened? He hit me for no reason. Why are you two fighting? Ouch! Ouch! Done! Done! Aakansha, help him. Hello! Hi Baby. Oh so whats going on? Say Hi to your boyfriend from my side. Of course I miss you. Its nothing like that. Gently! Ouch! Gently! Gently! Jerry, You guys should not have fought. What did I do? Rishi is the one who initiated the fight. I was calm. See whatever happened was not good. Fighting wont help anyone. Jerry, now promise me you wont fight ever again. I promise you. Aakansha, you are a very nice person. I irritated you so much. But you are still taking care of me. Thank you so much. Come on, Jerry. You dont need to thank me for anything. I would have done the same even if I hadnt known you. Its called humanity, Jerry. Okay Jerry, now take some rest. I am sorry Aakansha. You were in lots of trouble because of me. No problem Jerry. I must leave now. If you need any further help, please call me. Ok. Thank you. We were talking about Muktinath, right? Its AwesomeSo fascinating.. How long does it take to reach there? It is said that there are 108 taps. Guys! Wed better not eat anything before we go to Muktinath. Puggy, we will in a restaurant you mentioned earlier. Eat your meal yourself. I am also going to Muktinath. You should have told me earlier. Hey Puggy! Hows the tea? Is it tasty? Puggy, Look there. Its so Beautiful. Yeah It would be so fun if we could go to Muktinath on bike. Its so nice, isnt it? Is everyone here? Where is Jerry? Where is that Jerk? Hes not a jerk, hes Jerry. Oh my Gosh! Are you serious Jerry? Where did you get this bike? Sit. Puggy! Bye Puggy! Bye Jerry! Bye Aakansha! Thanks a lot Jerry. This is the most interesting moment of my life. I can never forget this. And me? May be. Jerry, why do people take a bath here? Because it is believed that whoever takes a bath in all the 108 taps becomes sinfree. Whoa! You talk smart. You dont seem that smart. How did you know all these? Google, Baby Google And do you think goggling will rinse all your sins? Excuse me? I mean, As far as I think Jerry, you have hurt a lot of people. And might have committed a lot of sin as well. Go, this is your chance. Take a bath in all the 108 taps. May be some of your sins will get washed away. Go Jerry! You made him do that. No, he went himself. Hey, you need to pay me for it. Please, just one click. You set me up perfectly today, right? Your sins were rinsed. Did I tell you to go? The bike is there. Just leave it. Lets walk. Catch him! Hes the one. Jerry! Hi, Good morning. Whats up with you? Youre clicking the button continuously. Is it fun to click the cameras button? Is this your passion or just a fashion? Of course, this is my passion. I was interested in Photography from my childhood. You know Jerry I have applied to one of the finest college of Photography in Europe. Last time I got rejected. But lets see. Hopefully this time I will make it. It is expensive but my mom is trying. You always talk about your mom but what about your dad? He is no more. What do you mean? He was a mountaineer. He was killed during heavy snow. I was very young. You know Jerry, I never got a chance to tell my day how much I loved him. Life is too short. And there are lots of things to do. So you, my friendstop chasing a girl like a loafer. And find someone whom you love more than yourself. No matter how much a jerk you may appear to others but youre a good guy deep down. We meet a lot of people in our life. But the most important person is the one who makes us relish the good part inside us, and for me she is the one. I kept talking to myself looking at your picture You may ask the wind about it I lost myself in the open sky drawing your image in my mind You may ask the earth about it My heart keeps on murmuring Let it murmur on your melody It keeps on enjoying Let it enjoy every bit of it Is this love? Is this love? I kept on staring every time by plunging deep into your eyes I kept losing thinking about you Kept on flying across the distant village remembering you You may ask my heart about it My heart keeps on murmuring Please let it murmur on your melody It keeps on enjoying Let it enjoy every bit of it Is this love? Is this love? Is this love? Is this love? Is this love? Is this love? Is this love? Why do you always take pictures of the sceneries only? Find stories, search characters. Only then your photography will be meaningful. Okay, Now you will teach me about photography. Its my prospective, whatever you want is upto you. Give me the sprite. Whats this? Brandy. Is this alcohol? What else can it be? Dont tell me youve never drunk before. Till now? Seriously, I will get you to drink. Me? It will be a new experience. Trust me, you will have fun. Life time experience. HmmmmWhat say? Okay. This is not a restaurant for sure. Because this is a distillery. When you get a wellspring, why do you ask for a tap? Come. Hello! Hello! Anyone here? Everyone must be asleep. Lets go. Lets go. Where should we go? Were already here. Everybody seems to be asleep. And there is no one here. What shall we do? Just come. Whoa! Tukchey Brandy NO! What no? Should we go home and drink milk.Come No JerryPlease! Just come. Jerry, no Jerry Now its time to get drunk. Ready! Ready! Here have it. No, I cant drink like that. Okay, just because you are a starter. At once! Cheers! Awesome Brandy More Hey! Okay I will drink from it. Hey!Slowly! Slowly! I see your reality now. It is so bitter, right? Whos there? Meow! Whos down there? Whos there? Another cat. You just wait. Im coming. Whats up love birds? What are you watching? I have a question. Why are the photographers so mean? Huh! Why? First they frame the person. After that they shoot them. And then they hang them on the wall. Its so mean. Nonsense! Ok, Now I have another question for you. What is the easiest way to earn money for photographers? Please dont make me listen to your nonsense. No Seriously..Tell me Ummmmdont know. Sell the camera, Simple. And then that was pathetic. Hey girl! Dont you feel ashamed walking drunk in the middle of the night? Uncle, what should we do? This is the age to do such fun. Dont talk much. Just go immediately. You know, Jerry 2+2=4. I know. Just listen! Just say! Today I am really so happy. Thank you so much. This is the best day of my life. Hey, Whats up? Are you on a night duty? What does that girl think of herself? How can she interfere in someone elses life? Look Aakansha, his reality. His friend Sunny uploaded it. Ill get back to her, Ill destroy her life. Aakansha! Actually this.. Just shut up, Jerry. It was so fun, right? But now I am so tired. Same here. It was fun, huh. Okay I will see ya after I freshen up. Aakansha, Look... Whatever you saw in the video was me. But I was a different person back then. And now a different person. The reason for this change is you. Please, try to understand. I am really sorry. I am sorry. I am so sorry. Did it assemble? It didnt right. Jerry, do you think by apologizing, I can fix this plate? I cant, can I? Our relationship is like this plate. Your apologies cant undo everything. Jerry, whatever happened between us, I am trying to forget it as a nightmare. And you also do the same. And from now onwards you do not owe me an explanation? Hi, Aakansha. Why are you sitting alone? No reason. Aakansha, I know whats going on between you and Jerry. But trust me. It was his past. And far as as I know Jerry, he has changed a lot. And I am confident that he like you. Look Aakansha, sometimes we miss the important things in our life because of our anger. As a consequence, we regret our whole life. So I think, you should give Jerry a second chance. And forgive him once. Puggy, I understand what youre sayingIt was his past. But Puggy, despite trying I am unable to convince myself. I am in confusion too, Puggy. Even I dont know what I am doing. Whether am I right or wrong. Hey Jerry, How are you? I am fine dad. And when are you returning from Pokhara? Dad, Im not in Pokhara at this moment. I am in Mustang. Mustang? Do you know if your mom finds out about this How will she react? Dont worry. I have already told her I will be staying in Pokhara for another 2-3 weeks. And why are you sounding so dull? Are you all right? Dad, Iam in love. Really! Its a good news. So whats the problem? First time falling in love is an amazing feeling.Go out and express your feelings. Dad, Is mom your first love? What do you think No. Son, you guys are very very lucky. You can express your feelings, love It was a different story back then.Dont make a mistake. Thats not the problem dad. Theres a misunderstanding between me and Aakansha. And I am trying very hard to sort out the differences between us. But she is not ready to believe me. But I know she likes me as much as I do. Are you sure? 100% dad As far as I know, nobody can understand a woman 100%. If they say they do, theyre lying. We men, what we attempt and do is try to understand a woman throughout our life. You go and express your feelings to her. If she really loves you, she will come back. Hey dad, there she is. I gotta go. Have a good time. All the best. Son, from Pokhara That means you still dont know much about me yet, right? No, I didnt mean that. Aakansha..Aakansha.. Why are you doing this to yourself, Aakansha? I know its difficult for you too. Dont you have any feelings for me? If you dont then look into my eyes and say it. First answer my question. I dont think I should answer all your question, Jerry. Aakansha, Lets sort it out. Please. AakanshaPlease! All right. Till the time you dont answer my question I will be waiting outside your door. Why only here Jerry? Why dont you go outside the hotel and wait there? Im really sorry Aakansha. She is not what you think of. Shes very different. I think I am in love with her. Hey, ask him how many times has she fallen in love? And do you use protection while making love? Are you my friends or foe? I am trying to share my feelings with you. Dont you wanna take life seriously ever? Keep laughing, assholes. Eric, This is not Jerry mate. Our Jerry was nothing like him. What happened? Why are you taking tension? Were meeting him after a long time. Lets go and talk to him. Lets sort it out man. Lets sort it out. Hey smile a bit. Were meeting after a long time. Put a smile on your face, mate. It was just a prank. Try and understand If I knew, you would take it so seriously, I would not have prankyou. Hi Aakansha! Hi! So how was your day mom? Hectic as usual. Thank you. And tell me about your Mustang trip. It was amazing mom. Cant describe it. This trip changed me and my perception about my life. Really! Hello! Hi, Jerry Just chatting with my mom. Jerry said Hi.. Hi! Ok, I will call you later, bye. And whos this Jerry? He was with us during Mustang trip, mom. He is really interesting. And from when did my daughter find a person interesting in just two weeks? Anyways, whats going on with your college? This time I will get scholarship for sure. They might have never seen such pictures till date. Youve already wasted two years for this scholarship, Aakansha. There are other colleges too. Mom you know it is my dream to study in this college. If I dont get scholarship this year, you have to help. Dont want to waste another year. And what about the expenses? Including Fooding, Lodging and Tuition fee, it will cost around 8 million Rupees. I want to get you admitted to the college you said. But 8 Million Rupee is a lot of money. Aakansha, please find some cheaper colleges. Mom, first thing, Its my dream to study in this college. Secondly, I have applied for the scholarship considering our financial situation. If in case I dont get this scholarship, Please sell the house that we have in Baluwatar. Aakansha, if you want to sell the last souvenir of your father, then I have nothing to say. Mom, I dont wanna do this either. But, in case if I dont get the scholarship, this is the last option. Please! I understand. I will give my best shot. Thank you so much. Today, I was going through Mustangs pictures. And I missed you so much. By the way, Whats going on with your college? I dont know Jerry. Last time when I applied to that college, they didnt like my pictures. They rejected it. But, as you know, I have taken lots of snaps on Mustangs tour and they are really nice. Hopefully, I will get accepted by the college. Im in confusion. What sort of confusion? Leave it. Its nothing. Tell me. Well I do want you getting admitted to your college. But what about us? I understand you Jerry. But there are lots of instances wherein we dont get what we desire. We must have to sacrifice something for a better future, isnt it? Everything has a price to pay. Thats true. How was your trip to Pokhara Jerry? It was so fun. Obviously, it had to be. You went there with your friends. By the way, Ive heard from your dad that youre in love, Right? I am so happy for you Jerry. And when are you going to introduce her to us? Thats a surprise. Id love to meet her. How do I tell you? I dont need to say anything to you. Will you be my valentine?

They have contacted me and will reply soon. Excuse me, I have to go to the restroom. Doctor, What does his report suggest? And how long shall we keep him in here? Well, I have seen all of his reports. Actually, he has a serious heart problem. May be he has a swelling in his heart. We call it Diluted Cardiomyopathy in medical terms. If there is sudden imbalance in the electrical impulse for some reasons, the patient may die. Thats why I have to inform you. But you should not get worried immediately. Theres a possibility that he may survive for 5-6 years provided he is given a proper medical treatment. Well try our best. Hello! Puggy. Yes Jerry. Whats the matter? Aakansha is not answering my phone. Why Jerry? Youre still not satisfied. Why should Aakansha answer your phone? To get hurt even more. Actually its a different story, Puggy.
