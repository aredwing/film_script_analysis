If Dominik wants to keep his job and Agnieska with her sister wants to be ... instead of proteins to study, then they just ... You have given us a beautiful dream. I think this is real. But you come to a point that you must wake up and realize ... that really just a dream. We can not copy. - Why not? It should not Miss Fadely. They say that Elizabeth have to be mature. Excuse me, wait a minute. I'll call you back. Say, what do you think you will do? - I'll copy. For the decathlon? - Yes. For extra things you fifty dollars. Can I copy? - Your budget is. But he may have just copied. - It has its own budget. A penny per copy? Here. I want money for school not wasting in children. You may not copy. Tell those children that athletes money, but they do not. Turn not a big mouth against me. - Do you tell them then. Jerry, what's your score? - What? My score? State 04 or 06. We are 110. - Thank you. Therefore, I can copy. We never win, so why do we have? No. You can not win so why would you participate? Is that you, Jerry? - Yes, Mother. Have you taken the filters? - They are in the car. I ga work. Stay on the phone off. Val not bother your father. That was an exciting party. Tomorrow? - Absolutely. I see you.

Jerry, the other children visit to study? Not today. Why not? They should be. This is real. I believe my eyes. - What is it now? I am a teacher. I am a teacher. I can ... I am a teacher. I must say I have so often said. It is not about winning or losing, but to play. It may not, but it makes it matter if you win. Cheating pays. Your father was just like mine that democracy was a meritocracy. Nobody worked harder than father. He understood why he after 24 years of loyal service ... was put on the street. If saved the company medical costs. I am a teacher. Guys, listen up. We know that tomorrow is the finale. There has now an opportunity occurred ... that I have your attention must bring. Paul, wake up. Some people think you do not mature enough to make the choice. But I think ... - What is it? I have the questions. I have the questions of the final. You would not share them. Sit down. You too. Sit. Nobody sees it, unless we all want. Together or not. I want to see, hear. Young I would ever see if we win. You want also? - Yes. I have ensured. Paul? - I would like to see ... how difficult it is. - Darius? If we have Young has it. Of course. The office of the decathlon is there. So twice wrong right? - No. Then we are even. - It suits us? Only if you talk. Then we murder you. Cheating is not wrong? Do not be sad. This is our chance. We are one force. - But this is going to win. Winning is not everything. It is the only thing that counts. What should we do well. Plecki? I am a teacher. I must say I have so often said. It is not about winning or losing, but to play. It should not, but it makes does matter if you win or not. Cheating pays. I imported crystal and this is what happens if you do not pay ... or if you have a creative accounting on nahoudt. Then you save it. If you want a loan, do you not. All about results. That girl does not know how he reached. The result counts. Has Bill Gates of the thieves Apple released the codes? I think previously promoted. He sends his children to a public school in Chicago? A public school community money. But this is a private school within the public system. The best education of our tax money. You may at this school and your parents know how it works. Maybe they do not live again in the city. They have a mailbox. They lie about their address, their income, their ethnic background. That was also about time. Where are the answers? - You can thank me. Jolie, you take language and literature. Matt, music. Darius, mathematics. Paul, natural science. Agnieska, civics. Dominik, economics. Flickas, art. All work. Yes, it's late, but I have a math problem and you are the best. Can I invite someone to talk music? So late still work? We do not rest until we are number 1. - For example, I hear. I'll look tomorrow. - Good idea, you'll be amazed. Very good. Ga zo door. Sorry, there just floepte. - Well, we go further. Come on, this has no meaning. Write the answers to your hand. - You want to be caught? If you are cheating, do it than good. Are you chewing gum? Write the responses. - I'm not chewing gum read. It can also still to hear. - And our shoes then? Wait, give me your calculators. Programming than I answer. Good idea. - I write it on my shoe. Guys, who has a pager? Then we have the answers. Good idea, Agnieska. Welcome to the team. Shoes are really much better. We can put a skirt and everything on our upper letter. I really do not dress to attract, you know. Well. The answers to math are: 1B ... Dr. Plecki, I would like to speak. Between you and me, please. Dominik does still he may do it. Dominik would make the state finals, and you are the national finals. I gave you the questions concerned. - I have already passed. What a bullshit. I got you worried exams. The national final is your reward. - Bullshit. I have been bad, I have regular exams. Would you like to the state finals? - Yes, of course. I think I know something. Ok. Then you can press the 'shift' and then on the memory' button ... and then you the responses are. And if someone runs along? - With 'AC' disappears. Is it back? Remember that not all well you have to mathematics. Jolie makes two mistakes, Darius three. The rest at least four or five. I think my highest score trip. That is the least. I decided that we do so. No more arguing. Do not be surprised Irwin soon as you see. From each school judging two former pupils. Irwin only and used the identification card of a friend. Here's your pass, Mr. Tully. Glad alumni want to help. Remember you also make mistakes. We only caught if we are to do good. Good morning, ten camping. Good morning and welcome to the state finals of the decathlon of Illinois. I love it here so much bright young people to see. You know, I tried my son fifteen to explain ... the academic decathlon means. And he said, that fool all these buttons for fun? You are a fool. That I found it ... But I know you know that hard work and dedication ... the keys to your dreams objectives. And you are ... You are our hope and our future. Success, ten camping. Let the world see what the youth. Hey, Jerry. Do you? Remember last time? Come on, one or two dollars dare you. Otherwise you never win. Here is a honderdje. Get that? - Yes. I have found happiness. Oh, sorry. Do you suffer from? Is everything on schedule? I had an invigilator killing, but ... The signals: up modes A. Left B. right C. Neck is D and this is E. Do we? And then we are candidates the super quiz to you. The number of base pairs in human D.N.A. where A, almost two billion. B, nearly three billion. C, almost four billion. D, almost five billion. Or E, nearly six billion. The correct answer is B. It was a great day. I see a lot of tense faces. But I go home. I make known the results tomorrow. You want to know? Who has won a medal? Language and literature, the bronze medal to Steinmetz. Agnieska Maryniarczyk. The silver medal for Steinmetz. Darius Bettus. And gold goes to Jolie Fitch of Steinmetz. And the winning team ... The winner the decathlon of Illinois in 1995 ... with a score of 49,166 points ... is Steinmetz High School. Should I address microphone? Listen here out. Are there still people Steinmetz? Let me hear something from you. we have reached the top we are not number 5, but number 1 even though we come from a slum we are now in vein thanks to our Plecki he is for us all Jerry is our hero You can not enter. If they see that juror was ... or if they take your picture ... - But I have you the key concern. Wait until after all the commotion. About a week no one knows you. - Bullshit. You have a great evening. - Incredibly, yes. I think that is also yes. I have only 180 dollars, but ... - Keep it. You did not know what to expect. Of course, they cheated. The question is how. I understand that. It is impossible for three weeks time to score 10,000 points. No. You can not make a tricycle switch to a Mercedes. These guys are not touching to us. - It is just a bunch of toddlers. No, I have no evidence. can for me all the results come? Yes, that's all. Well, thanks. Did you face when we won? That was a price. They were not at their loss. - They gave me not even a hand. We would have cheated. Just like we are stupid to win. I find it amazing what you have done. Do you see those prices. Even for things where we were not prepared. Agnieska, your speech was beautiful. You got a bronze medal. And Dominik gold. Jolie was her answer lost but watch those medals. You have all great performance. But now comes the most difficult. Our mouths closed. That is the real test what you can handle. You may say nothing at all. Not to your parents ... or against your friends, if you still have, at least. Not against your teachers. Not even to your priest. That should not. Benjamin Franklin said: Three people can only keep a secret ... two of them dead. Let us prove the opposite. They said it could not. A normal school was Whitney Young t beat. That they miss. Teachers Corps, which you have created. But are ga. Give your teachers a applausje. That call is not done correctly. But the honor is mainly to Dr. Jerry Plecki. Jerry, you have these children learned to win. I do not know how ... but I want you to continue to do so. There are reporters here ... so I would like our school even in the picture is positive. Our school has not the-art facilities. We have less money than others. We have something much more important. We care about people. This amazing victory we will not forget quickly. The foundations for this victory Dr. Plecki. Dr. Plecki is the best. He has shown that there is always a way. Without him this team are not there. Have they learned hard? - Months Lang. During holidays, weekends. Really all the time. Even on birthdays. Past this is in your closet prices? - No. I take him with me to bed. Now comes the national finals. - Yeah, exciting. Watch out, Steinmetz coming. - They'll experience there. Thanks and much success. - Hi, Mom. Those kids were here day and night. They are champions. Children must be in a team. He has a winning team of them. His father taught him hard work. Could his father this is just experience. - The children have worked hard. Months. And it's rewarded. - It is far too modest. Chicago do not get enough this fairy tale. But there is checkered for the national finals. This is April 14 held here in Chicago. We wish them success. There were surprises in the exams? - No, we had us well prepared. What do we do now? At the national finals. We will do good. And if we fall back 9000 points and not even be the 43rd? That will not happen. I think that without your help also could win. I guess really. This was for you a psychological incentive. It's between the ears. It's about confidence. Knowing that everyone there can beat. You know what I think? The keys to the national round are fixed at the same place. It is now no better protected than then. I just ga ... - Yes, that's good. We want photos of the entire group. - Good. Come on, guys. Ga close to each other. - Always on it. The whole time, yes. The following story is true. The names have changed. In order to protect myself. I want to remain anonymous. If Dr. Plicky saw how easy you the keys came ... would the authorities it on. But when he saw that he was sneaky smile. He began ... The group was happy. I was perplexed when they started cheating. They broke through. Dr. Plicky found I still juror could help. That was a surprise. If I do not participated, I got no recognition. If anything the team had had Steinmetz something. I did it. I shook Dr. Plicky hand. My last token of respect for him. A friendly match became deception. I lost my soul to the devil sold. What will the rest feel? They are consumed by guilt. What is this? - A story. I know, Irwin. But there is a core of truth? Any good writer draws on inspiration from his own life. It is a simple question. Had you the key or not? Okay, good. It was as follows. I thought it would be nice as the 'fairy tale team' ... more attention because that would be cheating. That would be very funny? Irwin is one of those writers with a broad imagination. He will be screenwriter. - I am al I have a number of drama - and action documents written. Good, Irwin. I think you have a very dramatic story is written. But you are not aware what this could do. You did this for fun written but there are people ... the pride and prestige of this school but like to draw. This may create problems for you, your teammates and the school. So I have to ask you. I want the here and now and in clear language heard. Is that story true or not true? Yes or no? Are you sure? - Sure. It is a strong story, pure fantasy. A kind of science fiction. Well. Write a corrigendum. - A what? You bored you. You have a fictional orchestrated. Fill it in. Tell why you've written. When it gets a tail. How do you spell 'orchestrated'? Easy. I have the names changed. - Plicky? Originally say. I save your ass. - Soon he has a microphone. Leave him alone. Sit down. - Keep your feet at home. Stay there, you. Sit down, you. Shut up. You understand their anger? Do you confess to the priest, not your teacher. Who do you think you the most harm with such allegations? You may not to the national finals. You have your foot over it. Listen, baby. I get it. You want the recognition you deserve. Ok. I think that is also red, but the was really too risky with all those media. If someone you recognize as a juror, we are all in trouble. And you have the most. Hello, what is it? - Can I have a word? Come here. Then you get my fist in your eye. I have the names changed. - Pak 'm. Hello, Dr. Plecki. Joan Isenberg of the decathlon association of Illinois. And this is Bruce McCaully of Hart Court Brace. I would like to congratulate your victory. But your team the keys again. We have the probability light ... on the basis of a mixed model methodology ... and the scores of your team in both rounds with each other. The scores are farther apart than statistically possible. Could you just say? - Whitney Young's score went down. Your score went up. Significant. You have the highest score ever. - That is why we won. I would like to scores you want to take. For math, for example. Kurgan, Paul: Regional 300 is 900. Kur, Matt: Regional 175 State 875. Fitch, Jolie: Regional 575, state 975. - Who have you hired? Mr. enabled because have been observed. I know who is behind it. Young wants to know why we have ruined their party. We just do our work. - View the scores of Young than once. That you do not. - Doubt our integrity? That is not necessary. Your office is on the Whitney Young. Only two years. Well, the whole system is corrupt. - That is not true. Do you really? - Wait. Let cool. Dr. Plecki, if you just want to say, say it now. We are guilty. Guilty of disturbing the system that protects Whitney Young. And that is wrong. You have misunderstood it. - I am just very well. Let's all calm down. How can we solve this problem? Your team must Thursday show. If the score is not significantly lower fails, the to the final. It is not fair. Young does not have to do. A good school will never suspect of cheating. We can assess just do it? We should sue them. - Because of defamation. Yes, and for disrupting of the state of affairs. For all the pain and suffering. - Guys, we're going to sue anyone. What do we do? We will investigate. Your students had average of four errors ... but other schools fourteen to eighteen. They were also well within the time. Then they should be properly rewarded. You are innocent to the contrary is proved. It is the scores doubt from the Spanish names ... and the neighborhood around the school. If they are so good, they can test it over? Why should they? - Anders suspect everyone. They do this even as they do on the test. I want that button to see. If the key over, remains the suspicion on our rest. Therefore we reject the key on to do if there is no evidence. Well, I have no other choice then further steps. Since the score difference falls outside the parameters ... and a new test is denied ... void the title and the right of participation for the national finals. The cups and medals to be issued to the Deputy ... Miss Joan lsenberg. If you give us the championship decreases, spanned a process. Do not let what you can, we will do so. You Steinmetz of, huh? I have seen on TV. Do your best to the national finals. - We do that for sure. We are really high, man. Look. Do you see that view. Hello, I am ... - Dr. Plecki. We expect you al I will designate the meeting. I think I can see Steinmetz. - Paul, ga re. I'm sorry I'm late. Everything good? When Constantine told what the hand was, I was pisnijdig. What a bullshit. Sorry for my language, I come from the street. I was not the right school, not talking posh. Everyone thinks I am lying worked up and steal it. Say that I callback. And you have not cheated? That I had to ask. You now know how I feel about it. I do this for nothing because you are wrong is served. Therefore, the press here for you. - The press? For us? If we want to win, we do it in public. Wait here. Yes? As you see in the press, they are the very best. They are the leaders of the future. The best of the school. But now they would be successful. The company Robert A. Clifford and partners ... the court will enforce ... that the committee decathlon title and the entitlement returns. One question at a time, please. Six were from Steinmetz. - We will better our best. But 17 of the 105 students had had a math question. Steinmetz had all of it good. - Thanks to our math teacher. How do you explain the high scores? I have to say. If we do not have Polish names and not a poor school were ... There were no questions. The rebellion of the Steinmetz - team reflects the courage and daring. The question now is whether they have done. Whitney Young should not whine. But they must learn losses. There is no evidence. They just worked hard. If it really is, they are still smarter than I thought. Call me. I have a job for you. Absolutely. We have put together scores. Unless someone proves the contrary, we are behind the scores. Should they surrender their title? I hear only allegations of people with dubious motives. I have absolutely no reason to think that no matter ... of people who are jealous because they are unexpected reports. Says something about Chicago? - Not about the city itself. Yes, hello. Gloria Abrams would I speak? You speak with Gloria Abrams the Sun Times. How did you get my number? - From Irwin Flickas. He has given us an essay decathlon on stolen materials. We continue tomorrow in the newspaper. Would you then want to respond? Dr. Plecki, do you know Irwin Flickas? Dr. Plecki? Dr. Plecki, you h. .. Jerry? Is it? - Sure. Go back to sleep. There is nothing. Ga again. we have cheated Steinmetz title may still lose What are you doing? Jerry, my newspaper. Jerry? Is there someone murdered or something? - Yes. You. What a rock passed, say. - This is not good. Hey, scram. What are you doing here? You want some of this? If you give them what they want. - I can study now forgotten. Ridiculous that he has done so. - I look so fat. Am I really that fat? - Yes, really. Maybe we need medals but returned. Then we can stop this madness can Young to the final. We can tell the truth. - Wait a minute. You have taught us one foot in the door to get. Turn that door now close to our nose? What evidence have they? An essay by a half-illiterate. People need to know why Flickas mad at us. He is jealous. - We are not mad at him. We have sympathy with him. - We do this to the top. Really. You have us survive. We must continue to support each other and the attack going. Okay. But you must understand it only gets worse. The media will lie, threaten and you set up against each other. Look well around you. These are the only faces you can trust. Say something. Have you stolen the key? - On Thursday. Leave my son alone. We want to be part of the story hear. I get beat. - Go ahead, Dad. I'll put you in New York in a hotel. I take you to the Bulls. - I take you to Cats. Away from my house. I've had enough. Agnieska is not false. They won. Mom, I need to talk to you. You've done nothing wrong. You do not know what happened. Yes. My child is fair. Mama, I gotta tell you. I see your son as the sole bright spot in this whole affair. He was courageous enough to wrong to condemn. Who will play me? Silence again. The film does not about you. It's about me. Let us first that essay have. You have the tragic hero, Irwin Flickas. And then you also Irwin Flickas victims. Finally you get the redeeming act ... of Irwin Flickas. That seems to me interesting. Your friend is on TV. - You got my shirt. I have just told. - Non-exclusive? I'm screwed. So my dad gilt: I save your ass. Get outta here. Connie Chung was with me for breakfast. I am in a hotel in Chicago for an interview with Angela Lam ... of the decathlon team last year. - Look quickly at two. She says that her coach, Dr. Plecki, gave her a piece of paper ... the responses of the super quiz. - Look quickly at two. Who is that? - She was in our school. Yes, I cheated. She wants very much. - Maybe tell them the truth. The team this year won the state finals. But Angela's story has raised doubts. I want the team to say: Be honest if you have cheated. Cheating may not. It is wrong, wrong, wrong. Integrity and ethics are more important than winning. What is she doing? - What is wrong with her? This is not good. What if they address us? - It is not good. That would be really bales. - The investigation is still ongoing. Live from Chicago. Lisa Martin. Jerry, go home. - I can explain. Argie Johnson called. The school board has suspended you. Really? On the basis of what? - Duty, colleagues disadvantage ... You can best with someone of the union talk. Can I use your phone? - You can use anything from the school. Where are the children? - On the road to the school committee. Listen. I'm already 26 years old. I do not survive this debacle. This is my advice. Further contact is excluded. Ga home. Keep the door closed. Do not talk with the press. Stay inside. Do that now. We are Jerry Marconi and Corinne Davis, Advocates of the school committee. We know that is false, but rather Dr. Plecki key stolen? Has he forced you? - Endangered? Alcohol offered? Drugs? Sex? He has made abuse your age. You ignorance. - You innocence. You're grown up, huh? And you know what right and wrong. You know the difference between right and wrong anyway? Good? Error? I know you do it? We have not cheated. Well well, you look what I got. The confessions of your teammates. You know what they say? That you are the instigator. That was all your idea. Come, Dominik. It is time to confess to. You're a good Catholic, like me. We have the same father confessor. Think of what the Bible says: Show repent and your sins are forgiven you. Let Satan does not abuse you make because we know how it works. Let it go, speak the truth. Would you like to live in shame? Air your heart. You can not live a lie. How do you fill that hole? This can only the truth, Dominik. Tell me the truth. Have you cheated? You have deadlines, so I keep it short. The Steinmetz team admitted. This is the confession of a team ... who admits that he stole key has been received. He says Dr. Plecki team has instructed. Plecki, the key is not stolen, but let his team 's use. The conspirators had him into their mouths. We therefore consider Dr. Plecki to accuse ... of conspiracy and fraud, theft of a scholarship and perjury. How has he got them so far? - The group is very important. It is a kind of sect with Dr. Plecki leader. He has brainwashed and this encouraged. I am the worst rapists and murderers worked ... but these children were the best liars I've ever seen. It was just scary. Mr. Marconi is one of the teams a bisexual witch? I can say nothing about that part of the investigation. There is a sexual relationship between Dr. Plecki and a student. I can not say. Where is Dr. Plecki now? - I do not know where it ends. Cheating is a serious offense in each school. I not tolerate in this system. Not teachers, not by others. That teacher is responsible. They should fire him. It shows how the lot is degraded. Formerly such a neck crime. Integrity was paramount. He has no moral sense. I had a bad feeling about Jerry. There was something wrong. Children who are late at night in and out ran. They were sometimes at night. A crisis team will assist to pupils and teachers. Steinmetz The school is excited. - There is dirty traitor. How could you do? How could you betray as children? That's it, mother. - Yes, it is. Teachers teach children not to cheat. - That they did not learn. Yes. Someone had they say that the error was. Your father was so proud when your teacher was. It did not matter how much you earned. He was proud of you. He led an honest life. - Yes, and he was belazerd. He was so naive to think that he hard work would come. No, it was a question that you would come. So he worked so hard. For you have opportunities. So he worked in that factory ... and he was breathing in diesel fumes. - He became ill and flew there immediately. They took him off his pension and his insurance. They have him murdered. That was the reward he got for all that hard work. Listen to me. Whatever happened with your father ... he never used it as an excuse to remedy what was wrong. You are not the victim, Jerry. What you did was wrong. You can in no way good talk. Guys, I ga tonight. The only question is whether they have me go lynch or be burnt up. I want to go to a friendlier place where no price on my head. Have you already thought to Somalia? No. We have made mistakes. - Yes, let us address. No, it is not caught and punished. I see as civil disobedience. Maybe that was wrong and I offer you my apologies. I do not know. Sometimes you rules Breaking them to change. There will be some change. The key steal is difficult. - Probably, yes. They must also justify the same team wins every year ... and that good education is only played by a small elite. But I want you all this you leave behind. If they ask, tell you that I have stolen the key. I have forced you to work look. I have threatened you. Because my career is over. Those of you starts only now. Here, we have something for you A little. Thank you very much. Dear Dr. Plecki, We have learned much from you. You were the best teacher we had. The decathlon team of 1994-'95. They were children. This' n adult them on the bad path may lead. It makes me furious. Unbelievable. For me school spiekt everyone. It is normal. In addition to drug users. They give no figures. Do you not think only harm yourself? Nonsense. I spiekte at school and came at a good university. Since spiekte and I graduated as a lawyer. Now I work as a lawyer. I earn seven tonnes per year and have integral count never missed. I am successful with a ten math. People ask me if I on hindsight would. I answer always the same: sure. I have learned more during those nine months decathlon ... than most people throughout their lives. When the media siege was lifted, we returned back to school. We had the reputation of Steinmetz harmed. As if that could be. We had to write about ethics. Matt wrote the autobiography the Dalai Lama on. That was fun. And when we each our own way. Most wanted leave behind. They declare me crazy, but I am not. And I'm not so good to apologize. I have my final year half asleep done. If I was not so. I have Dr. Plecki not seen since that day. I heard something about a company. I considered him to look ... but I have never done. We see each other when the time is ripe. Yes, I am. I study at a university. Just as well. Plecki had promised. The admission committee found the decathlon my character was strengthened. I get good grades. And no, I do not peek. Do not laugh, but I think it to be a teacher. There is no better work than the formation of young people. If I see one of my students cheating, I report the bastard. But if they can swindle me, they are ready for the real world. I would not otherwise want. Dr. Gerard is married Plecki and a company. He was never able charged. Paul Kurgan was studying and sat in the student. He refuses to talk the decathlon. Agnieska Maryniarczyk studied. She wants a career in public relations. After school Matt Kur at a hardware store works. He was employee of the Monday Dominik Wesolowski is moved to another state. He is almost a graduate in business. Darius Bettus want nothing about themselves say. He maintains that he has not cheated. Irwin Flickas intends journalist should be. Whitney Young was second in the national championship. Steinmetz has not participated in the decathlon. The chairman of the school committee D. Sharon Grant ... was in prison for evasion of income tax. school spiekt ever. what is wrong with that.
