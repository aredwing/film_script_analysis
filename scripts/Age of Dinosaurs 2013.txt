Now! - Blood lose is at 2,000 CC. - Heart rate is 134. B21 ready. Administering compound B21. B21. Increase 10, 15, 20. Full synaptic transfer complete. Stay away from the doors. They are locked to contain the experiment. We have to follow procedure. Open those doors! They're trapped! Do not open those doors. Doug. Get those doors open. Or I will make it my mission to shut this program down. To shut Geneti-Sharp down, and to make you personally responsible. Don't shoot. It's not attacking. It smells the blood. Everybody freeze. No sudden movements. It's sensing the blood. Not you. Rosario. Hold of on the gas for now. You have to get them out of there. The 2 of you behind the Komodo. Rosario.

And that's 10 inches of polymer compound used on the space shuttle. Marvelous. Let the show begin. We almost done? Oh. Funny. That's very funny. Listen, You're going to enjoy yourself and you're going to learn something. You see that right there? That's a pteranodon. Now, they usually make their nest on the highest pikes. And when capture their prey; sometimes... ...they'll bring their prey back up to their nests where it's impossible for the prey to escape. That means that the pteranodon can come back and feed at its leisure. I know the feeling. Seriously though, how much longer? Listen, You're going to be sorry that you are... ...not enjoying this quality time with your old man. Ok? Who you texting now? Who do you think? Hi. I'm Kim Abas. Most of you know me as a model and actress. And it's all thanks to Geneti - Sharp. When I was 10 years old, a house fire took the life of my family. And left me with 3rd degree burns all over 85% of my body. But thanks to Geneti-Sharp's miracle technology... ...today I'm a healty confident woman. Able to live the dream of beauty, unscarred. And here's the man I owe it all to. Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm pleased to introduce you to to the savior of Geneti-Sharp, and the man who saved my beauty. CEO Sir Justin Juarisco. Thank you Kim. Now there's a woman that has curves in places where most women don't even have places. And thank you everybody for being here today. This has been an exciting year for Geneti-Sharp. Rising from the ashes of near extinction to become the 8th next business of a new era in Biotechnology and Medical Therapies. But, the time has come for us to expand our horizons. Explore new world of science and excitement. ...by looking back for the next step forward. Of course, Geneti-Sharp is proud of our patented flesh regeneration technology. We Geneti-Sharp have been able to help over of a quarter of a million burn victims recover and go on to live healthy normal lives. Gasp] So, What does all this have to do with today? And what can it possible have to do with dinosaurs? The museum is gonna make a fortune. Activate the sonic guide beacons. Let's see if this Marvel of modern sound technology works with a crowd around. Let's send out curly. Wow. Meet the dinosaurs. Fierce. Ferocious and back from the dead for real. Here for you to see. First. Our techniques have become so sophisticated that we can now regenerate living flesh from a single sample of DNA. Keep the high frequency beacons on auto. Our patent silent guide technology allows us to control the uncontrollable. To bend their sense of direction To our every care. It's better then a closed movie, Theme Park. We are finally able to have dinosaurs. Real dinosaurs. At any event venue that we choose. From sporting events, to parades. Children's Birthday parties. If somebody asked me, Just why meat eaters? Well yeah, we're starting with the small stuff like a Butterfly or a lizard. But as I'm sure you'll agree, Why wait? Let's go with the cool stuff. Beyond the money to be made on displays and shows. I wanted to make a point about humanities future. Cause if we can make something from 100 million years ago finally able to walk again, then we can make anything walk again. And the Oscar goes to... Thank you Kim. Who am I fooling? At the end of the day, it's not about Stocks. or investments or even old men who can walk again. It's about cool, Kick ass cool. Justin skip some pages. Drop Moe and Larry. We are going Straight to the ceratosaurus. These are just 1st of many biotron of wonders. That will lead Geneti-Sharp into the future. The people are sharp. The future is sharp. Geneti-Sharp. Oh wait a second. There's one more thing. Right now. In our warehouse. Right next door. There are over 100 of these wonderful creations being prepared for worldwide distribution. Museums. Parades. Sporting events. Even your own front yard. Ok, bring it back to the script. Sir. The Dinosaur is not responding to the sonic waves. The sonic pulses are irritating the other Dinosaurs. While these are aggressive creatures. We have built an even more aggressive cage. These cages can withstand 240,000psi. Which is used to hold rocket ships together in space. Nothing is going He's just a little spooked. A little cranky. You would be too if you just woke up from a 78 million year nap. Crap. Spray it. Heavy dose. There is no cause for alarm. Trust me. Wha la. Sir we have elevated levels in holding cell 4. What's in 4? Larry. Jane! It's ok. It's ok. Rosario. Craig. Get out of here. To the warehouse. Let's go! Go. Go. Go. Dammit. Jane! I heard her too. Let's go. Which way? We're going to split up. You need a weapon too. I think I'm covered. Ok. What's going one here. It's a possible hostage situation. So far a lot of chatter about crazy stuff Sir. I don't care how crazy it sounds. I need to know. People are calling about dinosaurs running around loose. Hey! Was that... Yeah. It was alive? Yeah. It was gonna kill me. Listen we need to focus right now. We're going to get through this. Ok? It can't get to you in there. You're safe for the time being. There's more of them? Yes. We have to get out of here. Listen the police know. The firefighters know. Everybody knows. The minute we walk out of this building, there will be 500 uniforms out there. But they can to us right now and we can't get out to them. This is the safest place for us. No. You're a fire fighter find us a way out. You have to. I'm not gonna leave you. If we stay here, they're just gonna come back. You have to find and exit. You said it would be safe in here, right? Ok. You leave your phone on. I'm going to text you every 10 minutes. And you're going to answer me back, alright? Ok? The door appear to be electronically bolted from the inside. The windows too. Why the hell would they need to do that? Panic room? For an entire building? Doug? Sir. We had to lock down the building. You've trapped everyone. Not everyone. I can't. No. We have to figure out a way to recapture the Dinosaurs with - ok? The roof. Try to get everyone up to the roof. Can Dinosaurs climb? Maybe. Perhaps. Hopefully. Hopefully they - they can't climb. And we'll get everyone to the roof and we'll evacuate from there. Dr. Carson. You're a vet. Do Dinosaurs Climb? We don't know if they can climb. Are you crazy? Do you know how many of these reptiles just escaped? Maybe 2? 3? Is it 2 or is it 3? I don't know. Doug? 4? 4? It was 16! Craig, you back off. I'm taking care of this. This is Japan all over again. Wait! Doug you told me- You told me Japan was under control. Guys! We have to focus on what's going on right now. I'm not talking about Japan. We gotta get out of here. It isn't safe here and you know it. We gotta get you to the copter. No no no no. Doug is going to tell me about Japan. Come on come on. Come on. Baby answer the phone. Sir. Another guy called. he says he's inside the building. Let me guess. Another Dinosaur story? This is different Sir. This is one is Fire Department, Latter 42. He knew this number. Chief Dawson. Who is this? Gabe Jacobs. LAFD. I'm trapped inside. What's going on inside. You're not gonna believe this, but Dinosaurs have taken over the building. Listen, People are dying in here. I need everything you've got coming in here. I'm talking about heavy fire power. Everything! Son. I am in no mood for Jokes. Jacobs! Jacobs! Mike. How long till we can get SWAT through there? About 10 minutes Sir. Make it 5. I'm on it. This is so - Kelly I'm not sure. We're not sure... ...what's going on here at the Geneti-Sharp event. But the police have set up a perimeter. And whatever is happening is big. What do you think happened in Japan? Shit happened. Did people die? Yes! People Died! You knew about this and you let THIS happen. It was - It was containable. No! Obviously not! I didn't ask to bring this FREAKSHOW to life! I just made it happen. You're fired. Now get the hell outta here. I'm not going out there alone. He goes out there alone, he'll die. And you? Why didn't you stop him? Listen to me. Justin. You need me. Because... ...I have the key that will shut down the warehouse. Now with it, now without me. This entire city is screwed. Cut it out. We haven't go time. My daughter is trapped in the basement. In some kind of display cage with an electronic lock. How do I open it? Who are you? I am Gabe Jacobs. LAFD. I know where that key is. Help us get out of here safe. I can do that. It's in an office. One floor below us. We got to hurry. We've got to get to the room now. RUN! What is this place? It's a panic room. The family is safe in there. Well we as sure as hell aren't in it. One there door is shut, it's locked until the key code is punched in or outside panel. You miserable bastard. You knew this was a panic room and you were going to leave us out here to die. Only if you didn't make it in. Looks like they get the last laugh. How do we get in there? Hey we can't get out of here. Get help. The outside panel is in the basement. It's too late for him. Come on. It's ok. We're survivors. LAFD! It's ok. Chief Dawson? Gabe? Yes. Listen my daughter is trapped in the basement. Calm down. Are there anymore survivors? Yes but I don't know how many. Excuse me. This is my boss Justin Juarisco. We have to get out of this building right now. Never chief. There is a family in the safe room at the end of the hall. You've got to get passed the Dinosaurs. Sir, we have to get to my daughter! Sir, Juarisco is in immediate danger and we need to get him to safety first. My daughter is in danger! Your daughter is probably already dead. Knock it off! Gabe listen. Let's take care of this family situation first. Justin! Stay down! Look out chief! Chief! What about the family? Forget the family. Clint! Watch out! Grenade! Mike you heard that? Concision grenades. SWAT issue. They may be in trouble. Chief. Chief Dawson? Alright. That's it. Cut the power! Get team 2 in there right now. Go!

Now! Chief Johnson do you copy sir? What the hell was that? Big. Dinosaurs. Fire! and as you can see the military is in control of the situation. Seemingly they are shooting anything on site that is big, moving, and reptilian. Bullets are not getting through the skin. Mr. Juarisco. You have to leave. I have a helicopter. It's not safe. We are locking down this whole area. Of course. And I'd get myself a good lawyer if I were you. You need help getting out? No. I know this building. Mr. Mayor. Chief Dawson here. You have to lock down the city. Yes Sir. Oh my god. Don't look sweetheart. Where's dad? Jade! Oh honey, you're ok. Hey. Have you go your license? I'll follow on my bike. Faster. They didn't teach me this in driving school. This is driving school. Easy on the break. Ok. Ok. We're following this giant Dinosaur, which seems to chasing after a car and the police motorcycle. And it seems like they are headed towards downtown towards Landers Hills Mall. Where is Uncle Leo going? I don't know. Would you try to swerve so much. No! There's people everywhere. Dammit. Why is the car beeping? I know. I should have filled it. Take that exit right there. I think? No no no no no no no! No no no no! Great. Great! Arg! - Dad! I told you! - I was going to fill it with gas- Get to safety. I'll distract him as long as I can. - Uncle Leo! - No. - No. Dad! - We got to move. We gotta go NOW! - Oh my god! - Run Run RUN! Ah! Jade! Get Chief Dawson out to the warehouse. We have Dinosaurs everywhere. I repeat, we have Dinosaurs. Listen, we are going to have to break away from this story. To get a better birds eye view. We will be back with you folks soon. Things aren't going to well are they? The power is shut off and gage automatic system and I can't get them off line. There's a shut off to the system. - System are down. - No effect. Look, You guys are the smart ones. Come up with a solution! Alright, Alright. How long do we have? About 1 hours. Then what happens? The machines power down. And then they just die? It depends. Depends. Ok? Depends on what? Their innate sense of survival. Hold on. No no No, where are you going? My daughter is in there. Sir you can't be here. I'm LAFD. Shit! Well then help us! Jesus Crist. In Downtown Los Angeles is on lock down per order of the Mayor. And the public is cautioned to remain in doors for their own safety. It seems like most people are listening to the Mayor's request which means by all appearances Los Angeles is a ghost town. Run! This unbelievable situation downtown is just a mess. The police are trying to contain this. We're going to see to try to get a little bit closer because you folks won't believe this is real. Amick, get us in closer. Come on. Closer. Joe you've got a good find. Amick, see if you can get us in closer. Shit! Holy crap! Great. Which way? Awe man, my biotech stocks just went down 30%. You've got to be kidding me. OH GOD! Jade. Jade. Over here. Listen we got to find some place safe. Go Go! Dad come. Yeah. Let's go. Up the stairs. This has been an exciting year for Geneti-Sharp. Raising from the ashes from near extinction to become the 8th next business of the new era in biotechnology and Medical Therapies. Meet the Dinosaurs. Fierce. Ferocious and back from the dead for real. I want to make a point about humanities future. because if we can make something from 100 million years ago finally able to walk again, then we can make anything walk again. Talk to me Lieutenant. I think we have it contained Sir. Spotters confirm reports no Dinosaurs alive in the city except for what we have gathered right here. Alright. Thank you Lieutenant. It's a good thing that got those National Guard Fly boys involved. It's a hell of a mess Sir. Damn shame. The Vessels for almost all the Dinosaurs are open. Locks on doors 3, 7, and 10 are compromised. Sir Justin Juarisco is on the phone. He says it's important. Yeah? Well everything that's happening today is important. This is all his mess. Unless he has something to kill these thing right now, I'm not interested. Copy that Sir. Copy. We can't say here forever. Why not? It's safe. For now. But I got to think of a better place- What? Find a better place for what? Jade, not now. I'm not 5. You know you're kinda starting to stress me out right now. Oh stop treating me like I'm a helpless child. I am trying to keep you safe. Then stay with me. You always have some place to be. The fire. The emergency. Any place but with your family. Is that what you think? It's true. Could we have this conversation when we are not surrounded by flesh eating Dinosaurs? Uh, It's been forever. I bet their gone now. Hey, Jade! Jade! Jade, Jade. Go. We got to get to the back of the store. Come on. There's gotta be something in here we can use as weapons. Maybe we should go. The fire is going to catch up with us. It's too late. The creature will catch up with us. Unless we have something to fight with. What about this? Hockey Stick? Yeah. I always wanted to play. I thought that was a boys game? Ok. I'm learning. Let's go. Ah! Ah! I hate them dad. I hate them. Get up on the roof. What?- Do it! Yah! Ah! Yah! Yaah! Is there anyone coming to help us? No response Sir. We're on our own. Sir, everything is having a complete melt down. How much time do we have? 20 Minutes. Maybe. Mr. Juarisco we need to get you out now. There is a helicopter waiting outside. We can save this one. No we can't. Please. You know I'm right. Get to the chopper now. Rosario, We're Screwed! We can win this one. Alright Rosario. Let's see what else we can do to save this gigantic mess. Oh Shit! No! Sir they seem to be traveling in a straight line. They're following the sent of the first escape group. See that building over there surrounded by the policemen? They're heading in a straight line for there. There's a lot of scent there. I can't find a safe place to land. This is a damn war zone. Did you get in touch with the police? They're not listening. There's too much chatter. Well they've got to know what's coming. Get me down there. Hey! Hey! Wait. Wait a minute! The girl on the roof. Hey! Down here! Land there. I got it. I got it. I'm going to thread the needle through the pipe. 5 by 5. My dad's downstairs. We have to help him. We have to save you. My dad is downstairs fighting Dinosaurs. I'm not leaving without him. Are you gonna help us or not? You're going to have to guide me. Come on. Come on! Wait here. Phone call for you sir. Gabe Jacobs LAFD again. Chief Dawson. I don't have a lot of time. I'm in the building in the corner of 5th and Main. Yeah we're out here. We're right outside. Look there's a helicopter. It just landed on the roof. - Chief! Chief! Chief! Oh hell no! Chief? Chief? Hold on. OK. Chief. The Dinosaurs are going into the building. Chief Dawson, LAPD to National Guard. There is still civilians and LAFD inside the building. We cannot fire inside that building until all the civilians are out. Copy that, but I can only give you 10 minutes. Orders are to eliminate the threat. We'll hold as long as we can. But orders are orders Sir. Copy that. Dad! Dad! Young lady look. My name is Jade. Jade, Look. We may have to face the fact that your is- No! No! He's a fire fighter. He doesn't leave people behind and neither do I. We don't have much time. I have to find my father! Jade! We're going to have Dinosaur company mighty soon. My helicopter is on the roof. I'm never letting you go again. Look another 5 minutes. That's all I'm asking. 5 minutes. I know there is at least 1 other person inside that building. 5 minutes! Copy that. Thank you. Thank you. That's all I need is 5 minutes. Come on Gabe. Throw me a bone here. You ok? My leg's not doing so good. Come on. We'll help you. No no no. You two go ahead. We're never gonna make it this way. We're gonna make it. You know I'm right. Dad. Dammit. We got to do something about that. Walkie! We need heavy fire power in the lobby. I want that big son of a bitch taken down. Sir the civilians are still in there. Do you copy that? Casey. I don't want you to think that I'm some cold hearted bastard. I've worked long and hard to keep them safe there too. There's no way they are going to make it to the roof with that creature inside up the infrastructure. We just have to hope and pray that... ...the building is strong enough to handle these bullets. Fire! Dad! This building is not going to last long enough for us to get to the roof. Jade, listen to me. You are going to take Mr. Juarisco up to the roof. I'm going to make sure they don't get past us. No but dad- The building is coming down. - Dad, I don't want to loose you again. - Don't argue with me. Listen. Sooner or later we all have to pay the real bill of our deeds. And my Dinosaur mistake is- It's too big for anyone's checkbook to cash. Gabe. Take care of your daughter. and no me. You have no choice. No. - Let him go. Let him go. come on. - No. And his final words were... Final words. Final words. Of course. Rock and Roll. Almost there. The helicopter should be waiting. Oh! You've got to be kidding me! Everybody get back. She's gonna fall. Come on! Move it, NOW! Hey listen. I love you very much. It's just nice to hear. I know I haven't been there for you but... ...if we ever get out of this, I'll do better. I promise. Thanks for telling me now dad. Come on. Come on. Come on. Jade. Hang on! The horse is dead. Follow that pteranodon. Step on it. Alright. It's headed for the Hollywood sign. Hold on. Hey, you're really not gonna - Yes you are... whoa! Your good. I know. There there. Down there. There she is.
