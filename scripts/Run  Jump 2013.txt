Smoking is not permitted... - Hey, lads. - How are you? - Hi! - She's here. - She looks great. - It's a big day for her. It was Gary and Nigel. Nigel was from over my way somewhere -- blackburn or something like that. Do you remember this one, Papa Schnitzel? Fuck! Shit! Oh, this bullocks thing! So the sun goes down and the world goes dancing And the stars come out and they all go dancing And there is nothing I'd like more Than a twirl across this rickety old floor Here we are. Here's the rabble. Well, I don't know why, but I just feel like dancing You must be Dr. Fielding. Hi, yes. Thank you for having me. Welcome to Ireland. Oh, excuse me. It's probably cleaner than you remember. - Should have put the bags here. - Oh, sorry. Sorry. Say hello to him, Paddy. He's videoing already? The sun goes down and the world goes dancing Doesn't look like he remembers. If I could just move in front of you there. Thank you. Look what she made for you, Con. I made it while you were away. Than a twirl across your rickety old floor Hey. Come here. Where is... my blue extension lead? Right. Shall we leave your dad to have a look around? Come on, then. Whoo! Back in the cupboard. Oh, yeah. Noni, where are you with that tablecloth? Do you think he needs a hand holding that camera? You could play doctors and nurses. I have it. Good girl. I got this one 'cause dad likes it. It's a lovely one. Oh, now, I have something for you. - Is it...? - It is. And money for your brother for that swimming gear he wants. Did you tell the doctor you had a guest room? He's a guest. It's a room. - Did you put the nutmeg in yet? - Yes, of course. Americans just look younger. It's the teeth. It is, too. Mr. Casey, do you remember the hospital explaining why I'm here? Do you remember Dr. Sud explaining why -- Mom wants to know, are you a "vegimatarian"? No, I'm not. But thank you for asking. Mr. Casey? Can I ask what you're looking for? I'm a squirrel. There. Mr. Casey? No, no, no. Don't touch that. Okay? Please. It's very expensive. There it is. So, Ted, you're a psychologist. - Neuropsychologist. - Cognitive neuropsychologist. - He's a brain doctor. - Thank you, Noni. - Yes. - And you're a Professor. Research Professor, yes. Leading researcher, in California. - We looked you up. - So you've done this before. I don't normally do case studies, but Mr. Casey's recovery was very, very rare. I'm Mr. Casey. He's Conor. You're paddy. The university must have a lot of money to do this sort of stuff. Paddy. It's very worthwhile. My paper will be part of a book. - And who sees the video? - It's like in the hospital, Pat. - It's stroke research. - That's right. You'll have to put on makeup and a good bra every time you come over, Paddy. I assure you, netia, I'm wearing a good bra. So then what exactly are you trying to prove? I'm just here to observe and document Conor's behavior. We don't really start with a hypothesis. Thank God for that. I was worried about bringing a hypothesis into my house. I mean, where would I put it? What would I feed it? Right, have we all got everything? Good. It's lovely. You want some bread, darling? I'll get bread. I want it. Conor. Conor, look, could you pass me the salt, please? Just pick it up, son. Pick it up. It's all right. It's okay. - There we go. - Thank you, love. Conor. Should be good for at least two wishes. Can I have another drink? Here, love. Next thing, she'll be running a bed-and-breakfast. It's twice the fee if he stays here. She'd be mad not to. It's only two months. Our son, the Guinea pig. Oh, you're a lot more bothered than Conor is. He's already more himself. I knew we just needed to get him home, didn't I? You did. Come on. I'm waiting. Hey. They may let you sleep like that in the hospital, but we can't afford to heat your bum all night. I've missed you in this bed, Con. I was, uh -- I was thinking we could keep on working on this. How's that sound? Conor made these. We have a distributor interested, which means they'll be in all the catalogs. He sells dozens of these windsor chairs. It's beautiful. And this -- well, this wood is ash, while this is solid pine. Morning, handsome. Right. Well, I'll let you two get to work, then. Okay. Shall we try "s"? Yes. "S". - S-s-s. - Good. Go. S-s... Soggy. S-s... Sit. - "I". - "I". Go. "I". - I... - Want to do "j"? "J". Do "n". As many words as you can. This is just for my records, Conor. - Lenny's dad took our ball! - Stop! Stop, dad! Give it back! Mine! Week one -- Conor Casey, 38. Bilateral anterior cerebral-artery infarction. Stroke has caused rare brain lesions in frontal lobe. Let go, dad! Subject was in a coma for one month and in-patient rehab the following four. Rehab was conclusive. Study will be observation of subject only. Upon return home, subject presents primarily with agitation. There was an initial focus on finding something he thinks he's lost in his workshop. "Relax." "And smile just with your mouth. And then raise your eyebrows and drop your jaw. Let out three hearty laughs." What are you doing? It's called laughter yoga. Please stop. Careful with those, Papa Schnitzel. Did Conor normally drive? He did. But he didn't drive normally. This bloody adapter. - I want a cookie. - Hi, Christy. - Hi, Vanetia. - Go on. All right. We need two trolleys. Can I have a euro? - Hi, guys. - Hey, there, loser. - Hey. - How you been? - Doing good. We need two trolleys so I can buy the items that start with "f". We're not getting a second trolley. I want to sit in dad's trolley. Can't. "N" is for noni. I want to. In you go. Dad, can't this be an "n" trolley? - No, it's an "f" trolley. - Well, she's a little fairy. We're not getting a second trolley, okay? - You're the fairy. - Conor! Give me the trolley. - What are you doing? - Get off. - Conor, get off! - Faggot. Fudgepacker, friend of Dorothy! Conor, you stop that and get in the shop now. Sorry about that. Sorry about that. Oh, for fuck's sake. Hi, boys. Who's Dorothy? You don't want to know. You all right? There you go. Right in there. 4:00 A.M. week 2. Third observed incident of somnambulism. Possibl-- Possibly parasomnia or other symptomatic sleep disorder. Do you have a family? No. Why? I'm a scientist instead. Want to play spa? No. I'm impressed with your dexterity. How many of those have you made, Conor? - Just need to make one more. - Hello? Yoo-hoo. More wood. Come on, now, Freida the fairy. Inside and get your hands washed. Come on, Conor. Dinner. Oh, Conor! Don't! I need more wood. If you put it back together, we can sell it and buy wood. Have you -- have you made anything we can sell? What are these for? Your mom and dad are here. Come on. Dinner. I-I-I don't like whiteness anymore because -- Because there were a lot of white walls in the hospital? And up here. I finished. Good girl. Conor's never gone a week without making something. Do you think he might need a bit of privacy? Mrs. Casey, I've left him alone for hours at a time, and there's no change. I'm sure that Dr. Sud explained the prognosis. Conor will not return to his old self. - There's been too much damage. - Okay. Well, all I'm saying is he might need a bit more space, you know, without you looking. - Mrs. Casey. - Just a bit of space, Dr. Fielding. Keep up the pace! Come on, Casey! Keep at it! Keep going! - Simon, Lenny, Fergus, Mike. - Congratulations, Simon. Hey, Lenny. That's how he likes it. - Is he under? - Yeah. I stressed that little fish place in town. - Oh, it's nice. - You know, it's nice lighting. - Yeah. And, um, about, you know, two days ago, I get a text, and suddenly, it's -- it's a tea. As in a cup of tea? No, as in an afternoon tea. Sandwiches. You know, cake, tea. And I just thought, um, you know, "What does he mean? What does -- what does that mean?" It's like some sort of -- it's like a downgrade. Ohh. Where?! Where?! Where?! Papa Schnitzel, wake up! - Con. - Yeah? Conor. Papa Schnitzel. Come, sweetheart. Conor, get off, get off, get off me! Conor, get off me! It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. You were sleepwalking. Okay? Okay. All right. We just have to leave it behind this time. I don't think so. In you go. Go on. I want to break that camera, Dr. Fielding. I swear to God. When it's too late to go home And you're tired of being alone I can see it in your face I can see it in your face When you're running out of time And you need some... I won't break your camera, Dr. Fielding. I swear to God... Again. Thank you. That would be good. Uh, Mrs. Casey? Vanetia, for Christ's sake. Two weeks of "Mrs. Casey" is long enough. And I'm gonna call you Ted... Ted. Where did the "Schnitzel" thing come from? Oh. Well, the Schnitzels -- they were this Austrian family Conor and I met on our honeymoon. They were always ridiculously cheery. "Impossibly optimistic" is how Conor described them. - That's funny. - Hmm. I've been Schnitzel-ing the shit out of it, haven't I? - Night. - Good night. Week 3, tape 9 -- second family outing to the store. Oh, this zip keeps sticking. Sorry, Noni, you're gonna have to go like that. Okay. Going outside. Going outside! Did you see that? Will he ever get the money thing? You know, never mind. Don't tell me. I don't want to know. Sympathy Susan alert. Who's sympathy Susan? You poor thing. How are you coping? How is he today? Must be desperate. I hate pity. It is like someone wrapping a wet blanket around you when you're cold. And that woman can talk. - Vanetia Casey! - Ah! Susan! How are you coping? Brilliantly, thanks! Oh, and have you met my what's-ologist? This is Dr. Fielding. Hello, doctor. I have heard about you. You're from America. I could tell by the tan. You wouldn't get many around here with a tan like that. How's poor Vanetia? I mean, there's probably no recovery from this, is there, doctor? - Well, I -- - I doubt it very much. I mean, my brother knew somebody who -- and so young. I mean, it's so shocking. How are you getting on there? I should actually... What is that Conor? Come on. Let's go. This is you, Ted. Contaminations continue, mostly when Conor is distracted or tired. Obsession with making wooden spheres continues. Come in. Can you come into the kitchen, please? I need to talk to you. Ted... I saw the birthday card in your room... "For a special boy." So, you... Yes, I did. A colleague of mine arranged it. It's completely inappropriate. And this was his idea of a joke -- a terrible joke. So you think it's a joke... Having drugs sent to this house? Not me! A friend -- not even a real friend. It was more of a-a colleague. So you had drugs sent to a house with two kids in it? I know. You had marijuana sent to a house where you should be working in a professional capacity. I will completely understand if you feel that -- Ted, you get it out now. And start rolling. Hap-hap-hap, Happy birthday! Come on, now! Happy Birthday! Hap-hap-hap, Happy birthday! You didn't have to do this. Happy, happy, Happy birthday! Do you want to dance all night? Go on. Blow out the candle. You know the drill. Do you want to dance all night? Now go on. Go and get your gear. - It -- it really was from a friend, by the way. - Okay. I don't think you are. Are you? No, nothing came out. Oh, there you go. Definitely some got in there. You know. Conor used to be a night owl, if you can believe that. He stayed up late last night, actually. He was watching some... Animal show on the TV. He's obsessed. What? I thought you didn't want to know things. It's been a month. Guess I should start knowing things. Animals demand less of him. He can relate to their -- their simpler emotions. No mixed feelings, so no psycho-drama. There's nothing but drama from where I'm standing. "Sundowning" means he gets more confused in the evenings, right? I like that one. "Sundowning." Hey, no yawning. It wasn't -- not a full yawn. You're trying to swallow it back. Okay, I yawned a little teeny bit. I know. Peddling. Peddling? Yeah. Cycling. I think it's gonna rain. Aye, it's much more fun in the rain. - Go on. - No. No, thank you. Don't do that. Slow down! Slow down! You're going too fast! - I haven't ridden a bike in a while. - Come on. And it's very wet. I don't think I've ever ridden one in the rain. - All right, how about -- - Mmm! This is so good. How about, uh... "Conor Casey's stroke of bad luck: Or a tale of two Conors"? You know, something catchy. I want our chapter to stand out. Well, unfortunately, it'll probably be something a little dryer. Such as? "The impact of extensive medial frontal-lobe damage on theory of the mind." What's theory of the mind? - You're right. It's boring. - No. - No. - I really do want to know. It's our capacity to understand our own and others' mental states, our ability to guess what someone else is feeling or thinking. I know. "Dr. Do-little", as in loves animals and... Does very little. Ted. Ted. Ted. What? Aah! Now stop that! Lenny! Connor! Lenny, Lenny, Lenny, Lenny! Lenny! Easy! Lenny, easy! Get up! Come on! Lenny! Stop that! Why do you play that? Conor! It's never a dull day. Have we got our balls? God. Whose is this? Do you -- do you mean that animals talk to us? - Oh. - Is that what you're saying? I'm not saying animals talk to us. They don't, but they do talk to each other about us. What do they say? All kinds of things. How we smell. Over a million visitors a year. 22 dedicated people. Welcome to... Remember the man who used to fix things around here? Hmm? The red rocks of the universe come down to earth. Do you want to see what Bob's doing, and maybe we can fix it next time? It's early morning at the zoo -- Hola! - Gorgeous. - Ol! Ol! Do you need any help? No, I'm fine. Now sit yourself down and tuck in. Hey, Ted's not wearing a costume. All right, give him a mustache, then, baby Schnitzel. Oh, I don't need a mustache. I'm -- I have one. All right, come on, everybody eat. I'm not sitting beside Penny. His name's not Penny. Conor. I just want a word with you for a minute. It has probably been a banner for yourself. Good lad. Ted, can you pass the guacamole, please? I think she used permanent pen. Did you? So -- oh, did I tell you this woman walked into the hospital yesterday? She had no trousers on. Girl like, "good Mary!" She had a bum bag on. You know what a bum bag is? We were spared some of the detail in the front, anyway. She's, um, throwing her curses around, as usual. She threatened -- no, she didn't threaten. She cursed my firstborn child, when I have him. Then she... What? Like a what? It's a Mexican wafer. I've got no idea what that is. She goes -- she tells -- she says to Dr. Muldoon -- she goes, um, "I'm a virgin." - Fajita. - Fa-heet-as. - Fajitas. And I'll tell you something. It was the best she ever made. You know that? What a word? "Best." No. She always is good. - S, seor. - And you'll remember what I told you, won't you? - S. - Are you sure? - Stand for no nonsense, you know? - Oh. And be true to yourself, lad. - Okay? - Okay. Oh, Paddy, do you think I was a flighty, lankish lass? I never said you were flighty. I said you were mental. But I also knew you were mental about each other. Jesus Christ, Paddy. Come on, you cheeky thing. Come on. - Good night. - See you, love. - Bye-bye. - What are you doing up late? - I can't sleep. Yeah? Come downstairs and have a dance with me. Dancing? At this hour? Are you mad? - Come on. - No. Come on, Ted. You must know this one. No. Sorry. Conor looked like he was fighting off 10 men when he danced. He said: "An empty dance floor is a wound that needs healing. It's not about us. It's about letting our bodies do their thing." Come on. Just a bit of hip movement. Come on, Ted! You must be able to move something. No, I... really can't. You're lost, my friend. All right, I-I-I can do this. That's very good, Ted. Come on. Dance. Please. I'm not dancing. - Come on. - You don't want to see me dance. - Please, I do. - No, no, no. No. But you know, you know It's a little trick you do Why... I'm a little tricky, too So we should work it on out Work it on out Should we not give in? Should we not give in? You know, you know, There's somebody waiting for you You know, you know, Waiting for a wonder like you Dr. Fielding. Hey. Tara. - How are you? - Uh, fine, thank you. Good. - Do you want to grab a coffee now? - Oh. No, sorry. They don't know I'm gone. You're not a hostage, Ted. Oh. I don't mean that. - We're going to the zoo. - Right. Conor's fixating on animals. And it's Vanetia's birthday. Yes. It is. - So, I'll see you soon. - Bye. I can sit in the backseat, Ted. - What's that? - Oh. You'll see. Noni, come on. Alley-oop. Happy Birthday. Give it to me there. Presents after food. It's a family policy. Thank you. You're welcome. What is it? A new adapter for the car stereo. Look. It's a spand. Spoon hand! It's for petting the animals. Put that in your notebook and smoke it. Lenny. Voices in the street Footsteps on the concrete Guess I hear just every sound On the ground From my window view I know a color blue - No, no, no. That can bite so very hard The day apart So soft! Hello, fella. Hello, little fella. Picture fresh as water clear Days have passed without you here Street lights dancing in the dark Across the park Brother sparrow To my window Brother sparrow Come tomorrow To my window What happened was I was. - Hold it. - Let me get the door. - Oh, yeah. - But, no. Here's your purse. - So... - Mine. - ...Saturday night I move in and out. - Yeah? - Conor was with me. Anyway, I said to Conor... So you established the back of the car. The back of the car, in the boot of the car fast asleep. He absolutely... - Really? - But then... Okay. Great. So, it was chasing him 'round. Where's my table? Surprise! I'll take her. Come here, please. - They're your friends, too. - I have stuff to do. You need to step up, Conor. You know, you can't keep retreating. Conor. You're the father. You're the husband. If you don't, somebody else will step in and play those roles. Paddy, this is not the time or the place. Let's get back to the party. A stroke doesn't give you an opportunity just to act... to ignore the needs of your family. How much time have you spent on them stupid round jobs? - Paddy, leave it! - Lenny is a disgrace. - If Lenny is gay... - Penny! I'm not Penny! Thank you. Well, at least it wasn't the python. Come on. Throw it on the roof. - Yeah, come on. - Throw it up. There's a spot right there. Hey. Come on. Shit. Come on. - Hey. - Hey. It broke. I-I threw it away. Netia. You scared the living shit out of me. Has something started between you and Dr. Fielding? No. Look... What happens when he leaves, Netia? Conor will still be here. So will I. And so will the kids. And we'll all be fine. Lenny doesn't seem fine. Lenny's fine with Ted. In fact, Lenny is closer to Ted than he is to Conor. And that doesn't strike you as a problem? Of course it's a fucking problem. Don't pretend you're thinking about Lenny, Tara. Light. Love. Start... again. Start again? Sure. We can start again if you want. Conor, the phone's off the hook. Did someone call? Mom. Well, I'll call her back. What did she say? Dad's dead, heart attack. Lenny? - Lenny? - I said I'm not going. I'll see you tomorrow. Can I have the red, please? Thank you. Nobody ever drinks that. Nora, you do know you can come and stay with us anytime you want, don't you? I think your house is a bit crowded as is. - Vanetia. - Right. Right, Vanetia. Your old paddy was mad about you. He was mad with me the last time I saw him. No, no, no. He was mad with the world. Con's as near to his old self as I've seen him for a while. You wouldn't believe it. Maybe you would. It's the final thing, right? Earliest memories. I know I'm getting good with this. He is not a case study. He's not a Guinea pig. He's your husband, and he's alive. I'm sorry, Netia. I know you're grieving a husband, too. Ted! Ted, I need a lift to the race. Come on. Just leave me here. Okay. Good luck. Conor? Morning, Conor. Did... Dad like the old me? I don't remember him... Being so angry when I was small. Your dad just got cranky with life as he got older. It wasn't you. - It'll happen to us all. - Do you think... He knew... I knew... He was just cranky? He knew. There was a house halfway 'round the world And I was invited in for a small taste of gin There was a hallway a thousand birds long But the biggest one of all was in a cage too small I asked the caretaker 'cause he was their maker He looked at me and laughed, took another sip from his glass He said, "open up your ears and hearts You put a big bird in a small cage, and he'll sing you a song" That we all love to sing along To the sound of the bird that mourns To the sound of the bird that mourns Conor? Conor, baby? Conor. Conor? Well, we rolled into town into sweet new Orleans To the apple bell bar there's a hole in the wall The ceilings weren't tall the floors were the ground But the sound that you would make would just warm their hearts Well, it was quarter to 12:00, and the boys walked in They got their black suits on, and the songs would begin You open up your ears and hearts You put a big bird in a small cage, and it'll sing you a song To the sound of The bird that mourns - Go, Lenny! Go, Lenny! - Go, Lenny! - Come on, faster! Go! Come on, go, Lenny! Yeah! Come on, Lenny! Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on, Lenny! Keep at it! All right, come on! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on, Lenny! Keep at it! Yeah! Whoo! Hey, Lenny! Lenny! Good job! To the sound of The bird that mourns The bird that mourns You put a big bird in a small cage, And it'll sing you A song You put a big bird in a small cage, And it'll sing you a song You put a big bird in a small cage, And it'll sing you a song Tough luck, guys. - Who's that guy? - I don't know. Lenny? Lenny? Oh, hey, do you know Lenny? Oh, my God! Lenny? Lenny? Lenny, wake up! Lenny! Come on! Hello? - Conor, come on. - No. Conor, it's your son. Come on! Please come with me. - Tara. - He's all right. Is Noni here? Is Noni with Nora? Yeah, thanks. He's in here. Is Ted here? No. He just left. Thank you, Tara. It's okay. - I'm sorry, mom. - Honey. Ted? I'm just collecting some of Lenny's things, and then I'm gonna go straight back. Ted? I just, uh, need your signature on these forms. Right, uh, here. And here. And this is a duplicate. It's a technicality, to wrap things up. Are you sure you haven't wrapped things up already? I can come back for them. Signatures. All right. Ted? Hey. Ted, are you mad at me? No. Of course not. It's just... You've barely come out of your room since, you know. I-it's work. I fell behind. I've had so much to do. That's all. I've actually been meaning to say congratulations on winning your race. I don't know if you could hear me, but I was screaming my head off. - I could. - I really got into it, didn't I? Yeah. Yeah. I thought you were... Heroic. You should make friends with mom again. I've been giving you two months, Conor. Please will you come into the house?! - No, I've got things to do. - You've got things to do? I've got things to do. I've got so much to fucking do! Just stop shouting. "Stop sh..." Aah! Stop that! I want you to come in, please. Stand still. Noni, please. Just stand still! No? Listen, stand still. Now, do you want to fall down the stairs?! You said, "pig." Now you get pig. I cannot be dressing and undressing you six times a day! - Look at me! - No! No! No! And a-a quick, uh, you know, around the world or something. - I can't? - You can. - Okay. - Okay? Promise? - Oh, God. Fierce. - You are? - Yeah. - You're going out? When Con and I looked at something, we saw the same thing. Have you ever had that connection with someone? For a short time. A long time ago. Now it's all brains all the time. Pretty much. Well, brains demand less of you. I need to ask you something. Hi. You've reached Vanetia Casey. Sorry I can't talk right now. Please leave a message after the tone. Vanetia. I just can't. Vanetia! - No. - Vanetia! - Wait! - No. Vanetia! Vanetia! Please! Vanetia! Vanetia! Mom? Mom? Mama Schnitzel! - What's going on? - Nothing. Mom was just playing spa. I want to sleep with dad. You can sleep with me. Come on. Ted says he wants to stay. Did he tell you that? I'm sorry, Con. It's best you leave. Do you love Ted? Do you? So do I. Do you love dad? New dad. So do I. Let's take Ted for a drive before he leaves. When it's too late to go home And you're tired of being alone I can see it in your face I can see it in your face When you're running out of time And you need some piece of mind I can see it in your face I can see it in your face I don't know why for me it's hard to choose But it's the truth that I'm in love with you But sometimes love alone is not enough And I'm stuck here in the middle of When you ask about my day I just tell you that it went okay But you see it in my face You can see it in my face When we're walking, you hold my hand And we laugh about times we've had You can see it in my face You can see it in my face I don't know why for me it's hard to choose But it's the truth that I'm in love with you But sometimes love alone is not enough And I'm stuck here in the middle of I lie awake while you're asleep Think about what might have been I wonder if I'm missing out On things that I should know about But then I think of what we have And I don't think that it's that bad In fact, I think it's really great So why do I feel this way? I don't know why for me it's hard to choose But it's the truth that I'm in love with you But sometimes love alone is not enough And I'm stuck here in the middle of I don't know why for me it's hard to choose But it's the truth that I'm in love with you But sometimes love alone is not enough And I'm stuck here in the middle of
