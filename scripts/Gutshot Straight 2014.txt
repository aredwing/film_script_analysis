Just let me talk to him for just... just for a second. Please. All right, Jack. But you've just signed your own death warrant. You... you don't look like you came here to pay me my money. What? You want my advice? Huh? I was... I was kind of hoping you could help me out. You know, Jack, believe me, this is not the kind of road you should go down. You're a fuckin' card player, Jack, and not even a good one. Are you my friend? Yeah. I must confess I've done you wrong and now you're tangled in the web of my song love's a gamble when you feel like I do events are bust I'll find another use for you it's easy, you know when you let go you will barely recall whether you were here at all try your best but it's no use suffocate beneath the weight of my muse life is fragile when you love like I do once you're gone I'll find another to consume it's easy, you know when you let go you will barely recall... Whether you were here at all love's a gamble when you feel like I do... Thank you, Curtis. How's that Viagra working out for you? Hey, Jack. What are you playing? I don't know yet. What are they playing over there? That is so out of your zip code. Come on, Jack. You know you don't belong there. What's the buy-in? 204 on a no-limit hold 'em. Buy starts at 40,000. Good, I'll take my usual. Good luck. Come on, I don't need luck. You know that. Usual Jack and coke? Oh, sweetheart, do you even need to ask? - The name's Stacey. - Right, Stacey. All right, well, you... you should get a name tag or something, sweetheart. I have a name tag. Sorry. Thanks, man. I raise. Six vodkas. All right, bring 'em right over. Ooh. Ooh. Ms. love, Ms. love. You know I got thrown in jail last night? I'm not surprised. What happened? Never mind. Listen, I was in there a while, and I was pretty hungry. When dinner came, it was roasted duck, and... no. No, it was a bologna sandwich and chips. No pickles, no lettuce, and no poker chips... just chips. Plain. I get to my top bunk, I'm read to eat dinner, and this giant black hand comes up, takes my sandwich. So I said, "hey, bro, what's up?" He said, "I'm eating your sandwich. That's what's up". So I said, "what are you in here for?" He goes, "attempted murder". I said, "you want my chips?" "You can have 'em, man. I'm not even hungry anymore." - No doubt. - "Just please don't beat me to death." I call. I got the gutter ball, sweetheart. I'm sorry. - You want my chips? - Fuck you. Thanks. You never showed up. Didn't want to show up. I saw you checking out the big boys. I was waiting for you. Got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em. That's what Kenny Rogers says. Do you? Do I what? Know when to fold 'em, when to walk away, when to run? I don't know, man. I'm just trying to get from point "a" to point "B" without conflict, you know what I mean? If only it were that simple. You play cards a lot. I play people. I study 'em, I figure out how I can use 'em to make some money, adjust my own behavior accordingly. I do the same thing that you do. Well, I guess we all play each other to a certain extent. No, not to a certain extent. We play people for money. That what you're doing right now? Huh? Is that what you're doing right now? - Playing me for money? - Maybe. Well, you're shit out of luck. I don't have any money. Well, let me ask you something. How'd you like to make some dollars? Enough dollars to keep you at the adult table for a long long time. Here, my card. Okay, I'll take your card... And I will give you my card. You can call me anytime, day or night. Okay? Hold on to it. And give me a call if you feel like it. I'll see around, Jack. Now wait a minute, how do you know my name? Everybody knows your name, Jack. You're the dude that draws to a gutshot straight... And wins. Call me... or not. "Duffy." You back again? Hey, Jack. Hey, Carl, good to see you. I've got some news for you, Jack. Paulie trunks'... Lost all his patience for you. Well, that's not really news, is it? You just give me the rest of what's left, Jack? Okay. Okay. It's right here. It's right here. There you go. Jack, if we come back for the extra 10 grand, I think even you're smart enough to know what's gonna happen. I'll leave you there to think about it. Guys, guys, hey, guys. I was thinking. It's strange, but for fuckin' some dumb reason, I like Jack. And I save him, I save his life. Now to thank me... you know me, I got your back. Yeah. Well, I'm over here trying to get some work done. You gotta just trust me, man. You know? It's all about loyalty. Yeah, now you're talking my language. Hello? Are we going to get to go - to princess palace this weekend? - Honey. - Because I wanna bring... - honey, give me the phone, okay? Mom, I want to listen to what he has to say! I know, honey. Honey, go... go wash your face. - I'll give you the phone in a minute, okay? - Oh, mom! Jack... She's really excited to go to princess palace with you this weekend. You have to show up this time, Jack. I cannot handle watching her be disappointed like that again. I'm serious. If you say you're gonna do it, you have to show up this time, okay? Morning. Is that guy coming over again? Probably not. Yes! He's kinda creepy and smells bad. Jack Daniel, is it? Yeah, yeah, I have a cousin named Jim beam. Isn't that weird? Sure you do. Got a nephew named Johnny Walker and an aunt named Chevitz with a "T." - It's not the same. - It's really cool. Okay. Mr. Daniel, it appears we have a problem. Yeah, what's the problem, Kelly? You have an outstanding amount... past due, actually. No no, I paid that already. According to our records, you have not. Are you sure it's not a mistake on your end? Our records are very meticulous, sir. I'm sure they are, yeah. I'm afraid there is nothing I can do for you until that amount is paid. Kelly. Let me ask a question. Do you like dessert? Of course. Who doesn't, right? Well, I know a place that does this bread pudding, and they put caramel all over the top of it, and they put like, Cap'n Crunch in there. And I know it's wild, but it's delicious. And I will order that over and over and over again till you get full. If you just make... just make this loan go through. I appreciate the offer, sir, but there's really nothing I can do until that amount is paid. I'll shave. I'm signing it. And there he is. Hey, Chuck. Hello, sir. Looks like you owe us a little money there, Jack. I can't help you out, man. Well, it's a tough economy out there, Chuck. I gotta ask you to go. Leave? - Look, I understand where you're coming from, Chuck. - No, sir, really. - Kelly and I were talking... - sir, you really have to leave. Sir, you really have to leave. Sir, I don't want to tell you again. You need to leave. Really, go! He's a real charmer. Do you mind if I borrow a pen? Do you think we should take Chuck to dessert with us? I don't think so either. Ahem. God damn it. Hey, excuse me, bud, do you mind if I borrow your phone just a second? This one's busted. I'm in a hurry, man. Yeah, it's a really important phone call. Just for one second. I got ice cream here. Okay, well, I tell you what. You a smoker? Yeah. How about a pack of smokes for the phone, 20 seconds? Quick one. - All right. - Oh, you're a gentleman. Thank you, man. Thanks. A lighter. Yeah, hang on a second. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, Duffy, it's me, Jack. You can keep it. I don't want it. Jack who? Jack, we met at the casino this morning. Oh. Oh, yeah, gutshot Jack. You mentioned something about an opportunity earlier. Opportunity? I don't remember saying anything about an opportunity, Jack. You said if I wanted to some big dollars and sit at the adult table, to call you, remember? Well, I remember that, but it's not quite an opportunity. There's a difference, you know, son. Okay, there's a difference. I'm interested. You're interested? Yeah, in making some big dollars. That's why I'm fucking calling you, man. Well, now you're talking, Jack. Ice cream. - You know a joint called dj-vu? - Yeah. All right, gutshot. I'll see you there. Get money, get money get money, get money get money, get money if you count money, go ahead, throw it up Louis watch, Louis shoes, Louis hat, who is you? Ask me, I'm gonna say that I'm Louis Deux money keep talking, let my money scream at you... Money keep talking, let my money scream at you... My money do that... Jack and coke, please. Haters wanna hate it till they're hammered y'all weirdest, body when they all start slapping push a nigga, popping... Here you go. - Thanks, guy. - Hi. Hi. That guy over there said you'd buy me a drink. What guy? Get money, get money - that guy. Get money, get money get money, get money, get money if you count money, go ahead, throw it up Louis watch, Louis shoes, Louis hat, who is you? Yeah, sure. What can I get you, sweetheart? A double vodka on the rocks, please. Double vodka on the rocks, my friend. And, make it a Grey goose. Classy. My name's Leanne. What's yours, stranger? Kevin. I like the name Kevin. You sure are pretty. Thanks. And there you go, Leanne. - Thank you. - Cheers. Cheers. That will be 12. What's going on? Oh, I said I was going to get you a drink. I didn't say I could pay for it, sweetheart. You fucking prick. Thank you. Ask me, I'm gonna say that I'm Louis Deux money keep talking, let my money scream at you... Buckle up. Thank you, darling. Oh, and would you, put the cougar's on mine as well? You seem to make friends everywhere you go. A fella can't have too many friends, Jack. Cheers to that. Looks like you have a lot of them, too. Think so? Yeah, sure, why not? You're a nice guy, reasonably good looking for your age. And you're rich too. That covers an awful lot of character flaws. Well, how can you tell I'm rich? I can just tell. It's what I do. It's my job. You say you play people, I say I read them. Okay. Read me, son. You have a manicure and you're not a woman. You're tan and it's not summertime. Your suit certainly didn't come from men's warehouse. Chicago-roll timepiece and that pinky ring's no knock-off. You're far-sighted. I can tell by the subtle marks on the bridge of your nose that you wear reading glasses. But the one thing that tells me you've got money the most is you're comfortable looking your age, which is somewhere approaching 60. And anyone's that's comfortable looking your age, tells me they got a lot of money. I would imagine you're on wife 3, because anybody that makes as much money as you do is either in love with their job or isn't any good at being married. Jack... You're wrong. I'm on wife 4. How did I make my money? I don't know that yet. I haven't figured it out. Probably by fucking everybody else over. You're wrong on your read. No, no, I think I'm right as rain. Well, that's pretty close. But who doesn't? Maybe, maybe. But I am interested in making some of these big dollars you keep talking about. Well, I'm thrilled to hear that, my boy. I've got to treat you like a lady tonight take you out and treat you like a lady tonight I'd lick your boots for the chance to take your hand... We're going to start small, Jackie. 500 says you cannot open that beer bottle with those bills. Do you mind? Pick 'em up. Now that I've become a slave to your sexuality - I promise I'll behave... - - like that? - I know that one, Duffy. - I can see that. Double or nothing says you can't break that same beer bottle with your bare hands. Okay. I'd like to... I said break it, don't drink it. I'd like to introduce you to the whore I am... - You mean like that? - Good boy. I know that one too, bud. We're going to have to up the ante on the next one. Yeah, that sounds good. But I think I need a drink first. Kitten, bring me another drink. Bring one for my boy here too. Yeah yeah, that's cool. Let's drink. Yeah, let's drink. Below your hips when I'm with you now that I've become a slave to your sexuality I promise I'll behave... Come over here, sweetheart. I've got something for you, you got something for me? Kit, where are you? - Boys, boys, boys. - Yes, another round, all right, for my compadre and myself. You know I'd love to, but it's closing time. - No, no. - We know what that means, don't we, boys? Sweetheart, come on. After the cash I brought with me? You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. Duffy, I'll be damned, I think she's kicking you out of here. I guess she is. What happened to your nose? I doubled down on 17. Come on in. Mi casa, su casa, right? - Oh, look at him. - Get out of here, you! Go on! Hey, don't do that to the little doggy. That bitch. My wife's dog. And don't you tell me how to deal with animals, all right? Yeah, hard love works for dogs and people. Come on. So what's this... What's this bet you got for me? You gotta guess. No. No, you know what? I'm... I'm tired of playing this little game. Why don't you just tell me what it is? Bullshit. You thrive on the game. And how did you know my name at the casino? You wanna know what the bet is, Jack? - Yeah, yeah, I want to know... - Follow me. ...what the fucking bet is. Well, come with me, Mr. potty mouth. What? Oh, yeah. Shit. Yeah, I could learn how to live like this. Hi. Who's that? A friend. Well, you got some hot-ass friends. She's the bet. Really, how... how's that? I want you to fuck her for me. I'll fuck her for me. Shit. I'll give you $10,000 if you do. Yeah, all right, I'm listening. I'll make it $20,000 if I can watch. That ain't gonna happen. Why not? 'Cause I said so, that's why. You got a problem with me watching? Are you a fag or something? This is bullshit, man. It's not funny. I'm out of here. Nice to meet you man. Tomorrow's Saturday. You got nothing to do tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, I do. I work. I play cards, remember? Well, you gonna walk your way back to civilization? Is that what you're gonna do? You're gonna make me walk now? Well, hell if I'm going to give you a ride. - Well, I guess I'm walking. - Wait a minute. Don't you at least want to know what you have to put up? Your end of the bet? I ain't putting up shit. Oh, yeah, you are, Jack. You're putting up your life. Hi. Hi. Those my clothes? Yes, they're yours. Thanks a lot. You didn't have to do that. You're welcome. Where did captain charming go? Probably back to sleep. Would you like me to get him for you? Oh, yeah, that'd be great. I know why he brought you here. You should put your clothes on and get out of here before he wakes up. Okay. It was nice to meet you. Good night, Jack. Did you dry my underwear too? Very courageous. I must confess I done you wrong and now you're tangled in the web of my song love's a gamble when you feel like I do events are bust I'll find another use for you it's easy, you know... Thanks for drying my clothes. You did a good job. Think I'm probably gonna take off, though. Are you really gonna lose the bet? I mean, there are worse ways in the world to make money. Come in. So what are you waiting for? You're not going to punch me in the face, are you? Maybe. Come in. No, no thanks. I think I've been in enough times already tonight, know what I mean? Is that a nice way of saying I lost my touch? No. Hand me my robe? I'm gonna regret this. Here. I'll help you up. You're evil. You have no idea. Looks like you're gonna win the bet after all. Always knew you would. I had you pegged. - Oh. - God damn it. I knew you were in on this shit. Hey, Jack... Want to see what 50 grand looks like? Why don't you fuck her? Something wrong with your dick? Come on, Jack, you're a born opportunist. Embrace it. This is not gonna happen. You're ready to do something behind my back. But while I'm standing here, you won't do me the honor of doing it in front of me like a man, when there's good money on the line? Tell me, Jack, just what is that? What is that? Huh?! Do it! All right, fuck it. Yeah? Just pretend I'm not here. All right, hold on. All right, all right, hang on, hang on a second. Hang on a second. Okay. Hey, hey! I'm not doing this with your creepy ass standing there with a hand Cannon. You just became ugly. Nice to meet you. Shoot me, shoot me. Go ahead. You want it in the back, huh? Or do you want a knife? Wanna go in there and get a kitchen knife? That's what I thought. Come here a second. Hey, Jack, Jack, one more thing. You remember what I told you about hard love? How about this? You want to fuck with me? Huh? - Oh my God. - Get up! Get up. Get the fuck up. Fuckin' play dead with me. Better not be playing dead. Holy shit. You're my witness. You saw what happened here now. - Jack. - I was just protecting myself. - Jack. - He fucking jumped on me. Listen to me. Listen to me! It's gonna be fine. All right, don't touch him anymore. Stop. Get away. Don't move him. They need to find him just as this happened. Nothing happened. No one was ever here. Hey, wait wait. Put those down. Slow down, slow down now for a minute. Let's just think. No, we need to get him out of here as soon as possible. No, we need to call the fucking police! Do you have any idea the kind of people we're dealing with? - Nuh-uh. - If we call the police, we are dead. Do you understand? Not really. Please help me get him out of here. All right, let's go. It's okay. I really don't feel comfortable leaving you with all this. We don't really have a choice. All right. Oh, honey, are you going to be sick? Nnnn... Oh. Bathroom's on the right. Are you okay? I'm great. This is probably not the best time for this, but I just wanted to thank you. I was a prisoner in this house, and... If you makes you feel any better, you freed me from that. Yeah, I feel a lot better, thanks. I'm gonna to get you a glass of water. How much is it? $45.80. Here you go, take it. What's this? It's your lucky day, pal. Thanks, man. You sure you don't want change? She's the bet. You're putting up your life. I know why he brought you here. Hey! Can I help you? Hey man, what's up? I know you. You were here, right? You're a friend of Duffy's. Yeah. Yeah yeah. It's been a while. Yeah, I'm... I'm saying to myself, "I"... you know, "I know this guy. I've seen him before. He was here." You were here. One of the poker nights, right? Yeah. Maybe, I... I don't remember. Yeah, about a year ago. A lot of faces, but you... you were there, yeah? Yeah, I don't know. You know how Duffy's parties are, man, they're crazy. Yeah yeah, unfortunately I do know how Duffy's parties are. So, is that your car? - Yeah. - Piece of shit. What the fuck? Hey, watch out now. That's my girl. Gets me from point "a" to point "B," you know? So did you rob me? I'm sorry? Did you rob me that night? You know, 'cause if you robbed me, I'm not talking to you anymore. No, as I recall it was you who robbed me. Oh no, that wouldn't be me. I'm usually the sucker at the table. I'm Lewis, Duffy's brother. Lewis. Shit, Lewis. Yeah, man, I remember you now. - I'm sorry, Lewis. - You know my name. Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I forget my own name, Lewis. Oh, hey, yeah, I know all about that. So you want to come in and catch up? No. Come on, I got omelets in there. We got all kinds of fruit, wines... really good stuff. No, really I shouldn't. You know, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by and say hi. You're from out of town? Yeah, kind of, Lewis. You want to know what he was doing in there? Excuse me? You want to see her? Come on. Is she a killer or what? I don't know about you, but I think that's the most beautiful rear end on an automobile that I've ever seen. You should leave. I'll take care of everything. I really don't feel comfortable leaving you here with all this. But you're not impressed. It's nice. It's awesome, yeah. Yeah. You get in a fight or something? You got fresh scratches on your neck. Oh man, no. I was... She was an animal, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, a real tigress. - Cougar. - Cougar. That's what... yeah. Yeah. You know I... to tell you the truth, I don't give a rat's ass about cars. You know, as long as it... as it runs, that's all I care about. All this is overcompensation as far as I'm concerned. Come on, let me fix you something to eat. There she is! Where's the puppy? Where's the poo-poo? Come here. Hey, look at that. Normally she'd be barking her head off. She didn't have any time for anybody but me and Duffy. Yeah, this is joy. Yeah. She's a product of hard love. Remember when I told you about hard love? Come on. I'll fix you a drink. Did, did Duffy tell you when he'd be back from his trip? I never knew he left, Lewis. Me neither. Great communication, huh? You know, I... I really shouldn't drink. I gotta be at work. I was supposed to be there right now. I was just kinda on my lunch break, you know. On lunch? Well here, enjoy the fruit part of your nutritional pyramid, my friend. Sit down. You're kind of a quiet guy, huh? No, not really. What do you say we cut the shit? You want to know what the bet is, hot shot? Did Duffy go back to gambling? I don't know. Don't lie to me. Okay. Hey, what do you say? Hey... hey, sweetheart! Come on down here. There's an old friend of duff's here. I want you to meet him. Did you ever meet her? No, you wouldn't have. She's a recent acquisition. Hey, we're gonna have a drink by the pool. Come on, join us. Pool's this way. Yeah. So... where did you and Duffy meet? Casino. - Casino. - Yes. You know, let's give him a call right now. What do you say? How'd you like to make some dollars? - Do it! - Do you have any idea of the kind of people we're dealing with? No. No, that's not a good idea. - Yeah, I'm sure he's dying to hear from me. - No no. He's probably busy. Take off that hat. I feel like I'm talking to rocky. Straight to voicemail, go figure. So, Jack, refresh my memory. What is it you do? That's a good question. I bet you got a good answer. How do you know my name, Lewis? You told me. Yeah, you did. You told me... you said, "Jack Daniel, like the drink". And I said, "a damn good one at that". - No, I didn't. - Yeah, you did. On poker night, remember? I think I should go. Okay. Thanks for the drink. Bye bye. I'll see you around, Jack. "Out out, brief candle." Roll down the window. God damn it. - Oh my God. - Sorry. Why did you come here? The laundromat by my house was closed. You left this. Oh, jeez, there it is. I took care of it. Yeah, how? I went to the desert yesterday and I buried him. Ooh, that's original. Lewis knows what happened. I can feel it, Jack. He has to disappear. Slow down there, tiger. You've been watching too many gangster movies. No, I'm serious. I'm talking about our lives here. You have no idea... the person that you were just in there with. What are you doing? Jack, listen to me. I buried him for you, okay? I'm saving your life. I saved you! Oh, great, now I owe you? Shit, I don't even know you're name. Listen, Lewis despises me. He always has, okay? And he scares me. If he has any idea that we have something to do with the disappearance of his brother, there's no telling what he will do, Jack. Don't worry about it. Get out before you get us both killed. Okay? How about that? Okay. What is it, locked? Oh, man. You are a piece of work. You haven't seen anything yet. All right. You couldn't wipe your ass with both hands. Fucking... unbelievable. Beautiful day for a swim. Careful out there. There's no lifeguard on duty. Hey, Zeke, there's a chump on his way up here. Give him that card and let him in, okay? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Would you like to come in? It is the only door up here. I believe that's for you. That's not mine. Oh, yeah, it is. Look at that. Come on in, Jack. Nice. Not nice enough. That's bullshit. Looks like 99% have been waiting on a spade. Fuckin' serious? Oh, yeah. Boy, was I glad to see that Jack. Not you, asshole. The Jack of spades. Are you serious? Oh, ay! Oh, ay! Mr. fuckin' balboa. You're about the worst tail I've ever seen in my life, you know that? In that car you might as well be driving a fucking bus. Excuse me, gentlemen. What'd I tell you about this stupid hat? I don't know. I wasn't listening. I'm just trying to lighten things up, man. So what are we doing here, Lewis? I think the question is what are you doing here, Jack? Well, I think I know. You want to know what do and, more importantly, you want to know what I know. Is that right? Well, why don't you just ask me, Jack? What do I know? About what happened to my brother. I don't know. You tell me what happened. If you're trying to protect her, don't. I'm not. Don't bullshit me. They started fighting. I left. I don't know what happened after that. Maybe, maybe somebody else went over there after I left. You ever think of that? Somebody went over there at 5:00 in the fucking morning after you left? So you think I had something to do with it? Okay. Hang on, hang on. Don't go anywhere. I wanna show you something. These things are amazing. You got one of these yet? It was a gift from a client. It seems like I found the black box. You know, the one from the accident. Aw, don't look like that, Jack. I suppose that it could be argued in some courts of law that it was self-defense, even if you were fucking the man's wife. The little damsel in distress. Well, she can take care of herself. Oh yes, she can, absolutely. She's proven that. The question is, who's going to take care of little Stephanie? That's who I'd be worried about if I were you, Jack. I'm sorry. But I know all about you, your kid, your wife, your debts. That shit's easy. That's just a couple of phone calls. What exactly is it that you do, Lewis? I paint things between a hard place and a harder place. And not to toot my own horn, but I'm a regular fucking Picasso and I'm about to paint my masterpiece. - Your hot tea, Lewis. - Oh, thanks, sweetheart. You're welcome. - What do you want? - All right, here's the deal. Duff was blood by default. He was a selfish prick who wanted everything for himself. Can you believe that? My own brother? You know, actually you did me a huge favor, and I'll bet money that you did her a nice solid too. Well, that's good. I did you a favor. We're even then, right? No. No, we're not even. You're gonna do me another favor. Like what? You're going to kill the bitch. What if I disappear? If you can, you should. But I gotta tell you, I got better eyes than you do, I got better ears than you do, and I got one hell of a loyal staff. So let me clear up any lingering doubts you may have. If you want to live, if you want those that you care about to live, you'll do this. Think about it. It's a really good deal. We'll talk soon. Don't lie to me. I know all about you. I know about your wife. I know about your debts. That shit's easy. Question is, who's going to take care of little Stephanie? That's who I'd be worried about if I were you, Jack. I'll be goddamned if some street-walking whore is going to walk away with my father's fortune. If you're trying to protect her, don't. You're going to kill the bitch. If you want to live, if you want those that you care about to live, you'll do this. Come on. What are you doing? I was letting myself in. How'd you do that? It was open. I was worried about you. - Are you okay? - It was open? Oh fuck. Wasn't smart. You know I could've killed you. What are you gonna do? What, am I going to kill you? Should I? I just came to see if you were okay. What have you gotten me into? Huh? It's may. My name. May. That's a pretty name for a pretty girl. So tell me, did you ever really love Duffy? Yes, I did... At first. He was... charming. There was something kind about him. And what happened? He changed. Started watching everything I did, everywhere I went. He said that he made me... That he owned me. I was afraid of him. I'm on wife 4. You're ready to do something behind my back. Tell me, Jack, just what is that? What is that? Somebody went over there at 5:00 in the fucking morning? Go home, may. I'm gonna take care of all this. How? Just go home. I'll handle it. Hey. Carl around? Yeah, he's in the back in the gym. All right, thank you. What's up, dude? Timing, timing. Excuse me. Hey, guys. You gotta be kidding me. - Fellas. - Frank. You must have grown some balls or you're just plain fucking stupid coming here, son. You've come to buy a car? Well, where's my package? I don't... I don't have your money, if that's what you mean. This guy, man. So you don't have my money, you don't want to buy a car. What the fuck do you want, Jack? I want to talk to Paulie. You are talking to Paulie. Everything that goes through him has to come through me. With all due respect, I... I got to talk to him alone. All due respect? All due respect? I'll give you some advice, Jack. Get the fuck out of here. You heard him, get the fuck out of here. And get my money, Jack. - Dumb-ass. - Let's get back to it. Carl, please, Carl. Let me talk to him for just... just for a second. Please. All right, Jack. But you've just signed your own death warrant. You know, Jack, I... I feel like maybe you're not here to give me my money, but you want to talk to me. I can feel it. I'm in a lot of trouble. Something terrible has happened. Yeah, like what? I... put a man to sleep... For good. It was a total fucking accident, I swear. - An accident? - Yeah. Shit happens. The first time I fucking killed a guy, it was kind of an accident too. I was just trying to talk to this guy, you know? And he really wasn't in the mood to talk, and so I had to get a little bit rough with him. And then, I guess... He passed, you know? I had to throw him in the trunk. But by me killing this fucking guy, I wasn't following orders. What'd I do? I left this fucking guy in the trunk for a long time. That's why they call you Paulie trunks? Yeah. You're quick. That's right. I don't... I don't know how I got into all this mess. A woman. And what is this woman's name? May. May? May what? I don't... I don't know, Seglio? Seg... Seglo? Something like that. You fucked Duffy's wife? Well, no, I... no, I didn't fuck her. I just... we just messed around a little bit. You messed around with another... you know, where we come from, that's a death sentence, you know that? I myself would kill anybody who did that. I understand that. And that's a good rule. I get it. But you didn't fuck her, and Duffy has a certain propensity for doing this kind of shit to other people. Yeah, his weird-ass brother, too. Yeah. Lewis? Yeah, now that crazy motherfucker wants me... To kill her for him. Madon, madon, madon. What about a piece? A piece of what? You know, you know... A thing. A thing? I got plenty of fucking things. What kind of thing you want? A gun. I need a fucking gun. Oh. - You want a gun? - Yeah. You a tough guy now? Let me ask you something. Do I look like a fucking pawnbroker to you? I got nowhere else to go. Make sure you get this into Lewis's hands, you hear? All right? You know, when you give a piece to somebody, you start to then find out who your real friends are. - Are you my friend? - Yes, sir. Yeah. I should put it in... - no, you might blow your dick off. - Oh yeah. I'll put it in the back. Right. - Get out of here. - Yes sir. Thank you. May, you in here? Jack, what are you doing here? I told you I'm going to take care of this. I didn't think you were going to come back. Yeah, well, surprise surprise. - You going somewhere? - We're going somewhere. - We have to lay low. - Just stay in your room. I told you I'm gonna handle this shit. Just stay there, don't come out. You gonna kill me now, asshole? Not now, motherfucker. You fuckin'...! Lewis. Fuck you! It's... it's over, may. Put the gun down. May, he's unconscious. Put the fucking gun down. Oh, Jack. I'll take it from here. I really, truly am sorry. Pull the trigger, may. You're so pathetic, honey. Don't beg. Goodbye, Jack. Holy shit. Get rid of this for me. What am I, David Copperfield? Yeah. I'll let you live under one condition, you get the fuck out of here. I don't want to see you again, you understand? Do you understand me? Yeah, I... I understand. All right, get the fuck out of here. - Yeah, yeah. - You're welcome. Thank you. I'll take that, Jack. And, Jack, don't forget about that death warrant. Okay, killer, stay here and watch this bag. I'm going to go say goodbye to some old friends, okay? I'll be right back. How's that Viagra working out for you? Hey, Jack, the usual? No. No, not today, buddy. You know, you look like shit. Yeah, look at you. I'm not going to be playing cards anymore, Oscar. And I've been asked to leave town, tonight, for good. That's it. What are you doing here then? I came to say goodbye to you... And thank you for trying to get me to quit gambling all these years. I wish I'd listened to you. Good luck out there, man. Thank you. Thanks, man. - Stacey, my favorite waitress. - Jack, what happened to you? I was breaking up a bank robbery. This is for you. It's for forgetting your name all these years. This is it. I'll see you down the road, okay? Sweetie, get me a gin and tonic. Jesus, Jack, what happened to you, man? You don't want to hear it. Good luck to you, Jack. Stephanie, honey, get the door. Mom, can you get it? No, Stephanie, get the door, I'm in the middle of something. Stephanie, that better be homework you're doing. Jack? You take your time to see lights everywhere fascination's right there in your eyes nobody can stop music in your head then all good things become wild oh, why? 'Cause Vegas is not your paradise 'cause Vegas is not your paradise.
