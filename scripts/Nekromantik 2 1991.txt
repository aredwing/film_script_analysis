Come on, let's fuck. That feels good. Come on. Come on, baby,|kiss me now. I feel so horny. Let's fuck. Oh, damn. My God, you're unbelievable. Do you want me to go out|and work for you? Shall I go searching... for corpses? How long do you think|that's going to last? Look at the state of him! I'll tell you something: If I meet a guy with money... then you won't see me|around here anymore. I'm not going to waste|the best years of my life... here with you in this hole! It's me. I know that we have|our date next week... but I can't make it then. Couldn't we meet|tomorrow evening? That's fiine with me.|I don't know what to do anyway. There's an interesting fiilm|showing at the cinema. What kind of fiilm is it? Yeah, I heard about it. Okay, I'll get the tickets... and please be on time. Okay, see you. Yes, I'll be on time. One coffee, please.|With milk. That's one mark. You know, I've always|been interested in ornithology. As a small boy,|I often went into the woods. There was a small bird colony|of about 40 birds... which nestled|high up in the pine trees. And as we went to Iceland|a few months ago... my interest awoke to new life. In the midst of the city|is a small lake... and every day|a lot of rare ducks appeared there. For example, eider ducks... whose feathers are used|to make eiderdown... and heron ducks... and also singing swans, that you|don't see much around here. Did you also see ice ducks? Yes, ice ducks too. They can only be found|in Iceland and in Norway. I found all that so exciting... that I later went|to the home museum of Reykjavik... where they had|an extremely rare bird on display... that became extinct in 1840. It is called "Geyrevogeel" in Iceland. It's German name is "Dronte"|or "Riesenbrielelenaelk"... and there exist just a few|stuffed specimens of this bird. I was quite astonished|to fiind one of them in East Berlin... at the Museum of Natural Science. The "Dronte" was a big bird,|about three feet high, unable to fly... and laid just one egg a year. Did you know that "Lummen"|can also be found in Helgoland? They have a funny name:|"Trotteelelummen". Anyway, there's a nice|natural history museum in Helgoland... and I went there. They had a lot of stuffed birds... and all kinds of fiish|swimming in the pools... like codfiish and herrings... in salt water pumped in|from the seacoast. The main city of the Westmannsinseln|is called Hamay. I went for a walk there|and came to a green meadow... where suddenly some strange birds|started flapping around me... and as if laughing at me... began a curious tune. They got real thin legs,|as thin as a match... and about this long... and are called "Morneelel"-"Regenpfeifer". Very strange. Anyway, they continued circling me|to distract me from their nests. That's instinctive behavior|to deter enemies. The largest living birds|ever to exist on Earth... were the moas from New Zealand. They couldn't fly|and measured up to 11 feet. The Maoris used to ride on them. There are some more birds|which are unable to fly... such as the kiwi... which has nothing to do|with that prickly, little fruit. It lives in Australia... and is their national bird. Another one is a small parrot... but I don't know exactly|what it's called. It's a small, green one... that makes small paths|through the underbrush. And of course the penguins,|which you also know. Did you know that those are direct|descendants of the dinosaurs? I haven't heard that before... but according|to the theory of evolution... birds are the only descendants|of the dinosaurs. You know,|there's this archae-such and such... that was found petrifiied. It was a flying dinosaur which|became the ancestor of all birds. So, birds are actually dinosaurs.|Can you imagine? A sparrow is a dinosaur? Ten past nine,|I was tired of waiting. Not being on time|has always made me angry... and I didn't want to miss|the beginning of the movie. On top or on the side? On top. Thanks. Got some salt? What do you do for a living? I dub fiilms. What kind of fiilms? Sex fiilms. Come on, you're kidding me? No, really. That's why I liked|the movie we just saw. They were only sitting and eating. It's different|from the monotony of porn flicks. What do you do? I work at a hospital as a nurse. That's my great-grandmother.|Looks as if she's sleeping. That's her husband. He died soon afterwards. That looks like she's buried alive. I have an absolute horror|of being buried alive. Here's my mother... and this is my aunt's burial. That was beautiful, very solemn. They had a choir singing choral hymns. Right, but I'm still alive. Look, it's almost real. Let me down, okay? Let me down, will you? Hi. I'm terribly sorry. I really wanted to be on time. It doesn't matter. Let's not quarrel about that now. - Want a coffee?|- Yes, please. Two coffees, please. How are you? Quite well.|I can't complain. How are you? I'm not sure. That's why|I wanted to talk with you. I met a girl a short time ago... and people in love|are supposed to be happy... but somehow she bewilders me. That's part of the game,|isn't it? Well, not quite. She's really nice but... I think she's somehow... perverse. You, of all people,|you call somebody perverse. I thought that in your job|one gets to see everything. Nothing like her. She doesn't want me|to move while having sex... and takes strange pictures of me. My philosophy... The fiirst rule is:|You look good. That's just a given|in our case, you know? Women are lonely. That's the topic of today's session. It's disgusting how you just|sit here and let yourself go. You're a man. You must notice|that something is wrong here. Just sit up straight|and fiix your tie properly. Maybe it's going|to work out after all. The thing is... you can't always pretend to be nothing|but a totally incapable, miserable slob. The point is to fiind some way|to get a start. If you try to get into it|and then withdraw in such a way... Do you get it? Is that clear? Hey, wake up. We're done. This is Mark.|These are some friends of mine. We got to go now. What have you been doing? We watched a videotape. My friends brought it along. Let me see. Come on, let me see it. Very well. Stop the tape. Stop it! I wouldn't want to get acquainted|with those friends. Why not? Because it's totally perverse|to watch this for fun. Or don't you like it? I fiind it interesting... and in any case less perverse|than fiilms that always show... dicks and cunts in close-up. That's supposed to turn you on,|but it doesn't work with everybody. Then you shouldn't|have left so abruptly. I don't want to talk about it|on the phone. Why don't you come over|tomorrow evening... and I'll explain it to you, okay? Okay, see you. Congratulations, you're pregnant.
