I'm going to Paris, not Tibet! Mr Fernand, the fair will be busy by Sunday. If you could get back... I said I'd take two days! Can't you display ten tractors without me? And don't break down again! What broke down? The breakdown truck! "Louis in town. Needs you urgently." Needs you urgently... Not a peep out of him for fifteen years. Deported for fifteen years. He must be in a tight spot if he sneaked back from Mexico. Either he needs dough or he's in an awful jam. We've been waiting for you. Tough trip? Tough enough! Glad to see you. The Mexican's getting impatient. He's back? It's no gag? I wouldn't do that. It's still a surprise. You've got some more surprises coming. Mr Fernand. He's here. Send him in. I thought you'd never get here... or that you'd get here too late. I had to put 500 miles behind me. I'm glad to see you, you old bum. So am I. I didn't want to kick off down there, without ever seeing a friend. And I thought of you. It's not that I didn't want to see you, but... you can't always do what you want. What about you? The cops didn't invite you back. What got into you? Thanks, doc. Tell them to come up. Don't you think... Shut up! We've got no time. Give the doc a hundred thousand. What's up, Louis? I came back to die... and to be buried in the family plot. America is fine if you want to make a pile. At a pinch, you can live there, too. But there's only one place to croak: France. Yes, I'm cashing in my chips... and I'm leaving a kid : Patricia. I want you to take care of her. That's a great idea! You knew her mother. Susie the Smile. You mean... you knew her mother. I'll leave you all the dough you need. My business runs itself. Folace, my attorney will explain. With my roulette wheels... I make a clean 60 per cent. And you rake off No, your kid and your business are fine, but I got a business, too. And mine is legal. Yeah... a fair-weather friend... I didn't say that. You didn't say that but just the same... you'd hand my little Patricia over to the vultures! My angel... To hell with your angel! You've gone straight. You forget about crooks. The world is full of them. My little girl won't stand a chance. They'll pick her bones clean as a whistle. I sent her to a convent school. I had her learn English. I gave her everything. She'll end up walking the street... and it'll be your fault! All your fault! Leave it out! I've seen you put on this act before! About dope, dames... anything. Moaning is what you do best. But don't try to pull it on me. You louse! She's going to lose her father. I'm dying! You would, too! I drop everything to see you and I have to listen to this. What a jerk I am! You could have come up alone, Theo. Does he raise your fever? Yes... when the men talk, the girls go out to play. - I'll wait downstairs. - I won't be long. I'll make it short. I've left my shares to Fernand here. Yes, he'll take over from me. You promised to tell me first. Yeah... I could have held a vote, too. But I decided to do it this way. Any objections? Because... that's all I have to say. I think everything is clear... Isn't it? Jesus, Louis! You won't have to wait long. Don't be a damn fool! I know what I'm talking about. Want me to open the window? Look, it's daylight. Yes, and from here, I can only see the sky. To hell with the sky! I'll be up there soon enough. No, what interests me... is the streets. They yanked me right off the plane into an ambulance. I couldn't see a thing. Everything's changed , hasn't it? Not so much. Tell me about it anyway. Day's breaking... the way you like it. The way we liked it. Girls are leaving the Lido... same as ever. Remember? That's when we'd pick them up. I never thought he'd die in bed . " Man's life between heaven and earth... "is like a white foal leaping a ditch. "A flash... "and it's over." China, 4th Century B.C. You're born... you live... and you die. - We all go the same way. - Not necessarily. I mean we don't all die in bed. I'm bushed. Got something to eat? Sure. - Those yours? - Help yourself. I always thought the Mexican would go the hard way. What saved him was his psychology. We're all not that talented. I got my own psychology: draw first. It's crude, but it can work. The Mexican was a real ace. They'll talk about him But he was on the skids... I mean, in his head. At the end, he'd say anything. He'd get moody, throw tantrums... You talked to him. Didn't you notice? Notice what? You didn't take his last will seriously? I shouldn't have? Well, I was wrong. There you are. No need to get excited. Mr Fernand agrees. Some guys would turn on the heat, but we're straight. What can we do for you? Get the hell out of here! I told my buddy I'd take care of everything. OK, so I was wrong... But right or wrong, I'm the boss. Look... We don't know you. But you're in for some sleepless nights, some real headaches. A "nervous breakdown" as they call it nowadays. I'm strong as a horse. I've lived in the countryside for 15 years. Early to bed, early to rise. The Tomato wants some help. Three guys are breaking up the game. - It happens often? - Never. I guess we can negotiate. If you want to get home fast, take a look. It's right on your road. Don't worry about the Volfonis. "The toad's spittle does not halt the caravan." Mind if we go together? I don't mind but you might not like it. I'll let you know. ls he a phony big wheel or a real sucker? To me, he's nothing. One phone call and, ten minutes later, he doesn't exist. They look stupid , but I wouldn't trust them. They're experts. The Volfoni brothers know gambling. They've raked in chips all the way to Las Vegas. What about the pretty boy? The Kraut? He puts out the booze. Times change. The Mexican never hired fags like him before. I guess he was getting old. He even helped out Foreign Legion guys. If it was for charity, that's another matter! This is the Tomato's pitch. I thought it was a big deal. It's a shack. The Tomato says... a gambler only looks at the table. He doesn't even see what's around him. Get down ! On foot, they'd have had a chance. But no one likes ground combat anymore. The infantry spirit is dead. It's a shame. Who planted them? The Volfonis? It might be one of their jokes. Let's not rush things. They may be expecting us again. I'm not giving orders... but stay in the rear. On the retreat from Moscow, the guys in the rear got it. You made all the noise? Excuse me. - Mr Fernand , the new boss. - I didn't know. Now you do. I'm the Tomato. I run the place. Why all the shooting? Nobody would jump you here. Somebody did. Send Freddy out to clean up. There's a heap outside with two guys in it. Looks messy. - Where are the others? - What others? The guys raising hell. Raising hell here? I don't get it. Neither do I. Didn't you call us? It's been a very quiet night. There must be a misunderstanding. Henri's number? Henri won't be explaining anything... to anyone. Three sudden deaths inside half an hour. inheritance taxes are really high. The Mexican told the occupant he could live here until his death. Three months later... an unfortunate accident. What a buy! He's dead. We couldn't get here right away. We had some litigation. Besides... somebody knocked off Henri. The Volfonis? When the lion dies, the jackals fight over his empire. Charlemagne's sons did the same thing. I'm Mr Folace, attorney. I regret the circumstances of our meeting. Your room is ready. The Mexican gave orders. That's very kind , but... I'd like to settle everything today. Were you a very old friend of Louis? His oldest friend. Miss Patricia will be sad. The subject is forbidden. No false notes! The deceased's wishes are clear. As long as possible, she must think her daddy is alive... in the Mexican mountains where the mail is slow... so he can't write letters. I've got to go. Mr Folace can reach me. I live with my mother. I'm glad you're here. I can't handle the child. I've known her too long. I was at her baptism. A beautiful ceremony. She was exquisite even then. Take up Mr Naudin's bags, my good man. Look, let's be serious for a change. A kid can pull some crazy stunts, but that's not our worry. Right? It's not my worry anymore. After all, you're here. What do you mean? Didn't you agree to take care of her? You'll go through what I've gone through. Visits to principals, excuses, letters of expulsion. You mean, she's been thrown out? From everywhere. She has never lasted more than six months. Just long enough to wear people down. Yes, I'm delighted you're here. Not for long. Things are going to change fast. She'll stay in her next place... or I'll put her into a military school with bugle calls. Tell her. - I will. Where is she? - She's asleep. Her little party kept us up until three. What he means is: "Your room is ready." Isn't your Limey a lush? Oh yeah... And he's no more British than you or me. The Mexican found him . Where? Here. Right in front of his safe, Jean had cracked the Louis XV sideboard. The Mexican grabbed him just as he lit his blowtorch. I can see it now. The boss couldn't call the police, nor pay for the damage. So Jean worked here three months to pay the bill. Then it got into his blood. He liked the job. After all, he gets his room and board. Till then he'd spent half his life in prison. He chose freedom. Funny, I thought you were taller and darker. But it's all right. You're Uncle Fernand? We should kiss, you know. It's done. Well, if it's done... let's do it. Good thing I shaved. Daddy told me you'd be here. When? In his last letter... about a month ago. Surprised? He wrote all about you and your adventures... and everything you've done for him. I'd like some tea with a little bread and butter... maybe some bacon and eggs. Can you take care of it? Tea at 7 o'clock at night! I guess I'm still on Mexican time. It must have been something when you pulled him out of the river. - Who? - Daddy. He wrote: "Fernand saved me when I was really in deep." He didn't say what river it was. Look, I'm dying of hunger. Will you get my food? You won't tell me? It's not easy to remember. There are rivers all over the place down there. Full of crocodiles. Are you happy? Let me wash. We'll talk later. We must have a long talk. - A serious talk. - Yes, uncle. Mind if I say uncle? Did you kill a lot of them? Crocodiles. There are rivers all over the place down there. Well, I'll take care of your tea! Since you believe in firmness, I'll give you a chance to try it. On what? On money... money that isn't coming in. The Volfonis haven't paid rent on the barge for two months. The Tomato and Theo are late, too. ls this a revolt? No, sire, a revolution. No one's paying . Are these guys grabbing my niece's dough? Looks like it. Did Louis know? I didn't tell him . He was too trigger-happy. If it had made the papers and the child had seen it... you can imagine, can't you? What I see is that you'd rather I did the shooting. A legal guardian isn't the same. His head chops off just as easy. Who's asking you to do it? We have Pascal. Shall I call him? If I wasn't due at the Avignon fair, I'd say no. But I'm short of time. And it's not good to leave bills uncollected, or to let the hired help dream. Dream? Do you dream in color? Antoine Delafoy, Patricia's most faithful friend. I admire you, sir. Patricia always praises you. You are the gaucho... the legendary uncle. She never praises you. She hasn't had time. But I can praise myself. That can be amusing, for I always take credit... for the exploits of famous men. ls he always like this? No, it's just a front. He needs to talk but he's really very shy. I know that he will charm you. - Oh , he charms too? - I don't charm, I enchant. About your dreams in color... Borowsky says they're caused by eating fish. I prefer Freud. He's more witty. - What do you think? - Nothing. I don't dream in color or black and white! I don't dream ! I haven't the time! Adding water would be a crime. It's ten years old. Uncle is so overworked. Coming with us tomorrow night? Where? What a sense of humor! Frankie Mills is making his debut. Beethoven and Chopin are silly, I know. But Mills makes them sound wild, ferocious! Everyone's going. Yes, I know people take their uncle to the circus. But you'll have to go without me. Tomorrow evening I'll be in Montauban. And Patricia will be studying. Right, Patricia? You're right. We must be gentle with him. What's going on now? Our friend will be delighted to explain. The Volfonis are holding a meeting on the barge. A committee meeting, if you see what I mean. Behind your back! Where did you get this? I can't say. I promised I wouldn't. It's not nice. There are two possible solutions. We can look into it or we can ignore it. Of course, it wouldn't hurt to take a look. We're going! Can I squeeze into your car? If the meeting gets lively, I have a calming influence. Do you prefer foie gras now or later? Tomorrow. I've got a board meeting. You're not dining with us? And I told Jean to bring champagne... I'm deeply touched by your invitation. It's phony. It's not. We buy it in Strasbourg. Costs a fortune. No, I mean his board meeting. If you ask me, your uncle from the pampas is out on the town. You think so? We walked the streets I won't be a call girl for his ghost. Street-walking... call girls... You purposely use words that hurt people. He's being literary. That kind of literature shouldn't be allowed. Louis wasn't progressive. He was right-wing. If you asked for a raise, he pulled out his gun. But he gave us security. You mean... he gave us crumbs! Do you know what he cost us in 15 years? Do you know? Tell them, Paul. I can't. And 30 million a year from our take. Know what that makes? Half a billion francs! And you kicked in just as much. Didn't you? I didn't say a word. I'm not paying! I invite you to do likewise! You're inviting us... It's nice of you, but some invitations... What's bothering you? The climate. It's like Stalingrad. Once was enough. I prefer to stay out of range. You're trying to pin it on me? Then say so: "You knocked off Henri and the two other guys. "Plus the Mexican. "And the Archduke of Austria..." It's me, Pascal! I'm coming. Who's with you? I'm with the lawyer. You're three, not two. I announce the help... not the boss. Maybe, but I got my orders. It's funny the way sailors need to try and communicate... If you stick with me, what can he do? Sue us? Don't. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I didn't invite you. You didn't have to... I own the joint. What's this? A seminar? I called them in to talk about the Mexican... about his funeral. If you mean the Mexican's funeral, that's my business. If you mean Henri's, you might take care of it. You can't pin the massacre on me, too. We'll settle that later. We've other things to do now. Let's talk business. Let's start at the beginning. Ladies first. - Madame Mado, I presume. - In person. Madam, Mr Folace informs me of a weakness in... your balance of payments. It's temporary, I trust. ls there an explanation? There are two: a recession and a labor shortage. The customer has other things on his mind. For example, the casual client has vanished. The one who dropped in to be neighborly. Now, after dinner, he watches TV. We can't compete with the soap operas. The Sunday lover has vanished too. Why? - I ask you. - TV again? He has a car, Mr Fernand , he has a car! By the way, you mentioned a labor shortage. The situation is catastrophic. They're scarcer than maids. They're emigrating! The call of Africa! They're ready to swim to Timbuktu! Thank you, madam. We'll discuss this later. Who's the moonshine artist? I assume you are referring to me. Your racket isn't booming either. But the French still drink pastis. Less than before. Young Frenchmen drink sodas for their health. Ode Frenchmen drink mineral water for their livers. Worst of all, there's whiskey. Meaning? Whiskey is our tragedy. I never saw that. ls it new? It's this year's Beretta. Just the thing for a close-up job in the subway... But, at this price, you got to work to pay for it. There's no substitute for quality. But it doesn't come cheap. - Who got it? - Uncle Antonio. - Berthe's brother? - Yes. I hope you now understand... why pastis sales are going down all the time. The clients are more and more choosy. It's a buyer's market. Take the case of tractors... I hope it's still hot. And now, it's our turn. Gambling is hotter than ever. You think so? Figures are your trouble. You're men of action. I've done it for you. What if we don't agree? Don't worry. I picked the simplest system of all. We carry over last year's figures. Stop it, you! That was a record year. You'll beat the record this year. You all look happy and dynamic. He has to rub it in. You'll collect a week from today. And if we don't pay, you'll chill us! Gentlemen, I thank you for your attention. Show these gentlemen out. Raoul Volfoni, you really are... What? A born leader. That guy doesn't know Raoul! He's going to have a rude awakening. I wanted to save you the bloodshed, but it's too late for that. I'll beat his brains out. I'll have him crawling on his knees, begging for mercy! I forgot... If you're late, you pay 10% more. He dared to hit me. He doesn't realize... That party made a new man out of me. Mr Naudin mussed up... a little bit Ode Man Volfoni. My compliments, sir. What's going on now? Just when the flute started! What a boor! It isn't done, uncle. Take it easy. What's wrong? Do you have business worries? Hardly any. I'd like an explanation. Put your shoes on. You look ridiculous. What must I explain, my dear sir? All this... soft lights, sweet music. Your shoes on a Louis XVI chair. An understandable confusion. Define your terms more accurately. Oh, it's not Louis XVI? No, it's Louis XV. But you were warm. Corelli's sonatas aren't sweet music. I think they are. And it's my house! I accept your thesis as a starting point in discussing... music in relation to its setting, the container in relation to the contents. Patricia, sugar... I hate to be vulgar or old-fashioned. The gaucho may be unrefined but he's always courteous. But I must be frank: your Antoine is starting to break my balls! Let's talk about me while you eat. Go to your room. 'Night, Antoine! As for you, young man... - I know the way. - Try to forget it. But Uncle Fernand... Mister Fernand to you! Protocol will win over affection. Too bad ! We'll stay strangers! I'm disappointed in you. You weren't very nice to Antoine. Your father couldn't stand bums like that either! A bum? Antoine is a great composer. He's a genius. Geniuses don't go barefoot. What about Franoise Sagan? What a way to make a social call... in the dead of night! We didn't want to ring the bell and wake everyone up. The young lady might get ideas. Especially at her age... We wanted to talk to you. I've seen you. At the Volfonis'. I was on the other side. Sit down while I eat my meal. You're too kind. There's a reason why both of us are here. Bastien is my father's sister's son. Sort of like a first cousin. Do you see the problem? No, not yet. You didn't give Mr Fernand my references. Top gun for the Volfonis. Five years in the game, day and night, and never a scratch. Don't you see the hitch? Suckers would call this a matter of conscience. We call it: a point of honor. The weather looks bad around you and the Volfonis. What if it gets stormy? Bastien and me are bound to wind up face to face, gun in hand. We're too honest not to shoot. This could wipe out a family. Yes, I see. Want a drink? - Never between meals. - That's my rule, too. I don't break training. Alcohol ruins your touch. Well, I can't blame you. The family is sacred. You have to respect it. What do you suggest? Bastien has handed in his resignation. And so will you. It's the least I can do. You understand? I understand . When child welfare coincides with labor problems, don't try to understand, just pray. "If this definition had not been used before, we could say... "that Bossuet depicted God as He should be, "and Pascal depicted Him as He is." You don't say! What? They only gave you a B! I won't stand for it. You deserve more. You're sweet, uncle. Patricia, honey... When I arrived here last Wednesday, we were drifting helplessly... Phone call, sir. From Montauban. The caller sounds somewhat... rustic. Farmer maybe... I couldn't make it by Friday. I don't know. In a week... maybe two... Well, take care of it! Every time I go away, it's the same old story. You're on your own! "And Pascal depicted Him as He is." I'd have given Miss Patricia an A at least! Do you know the balance of our account? Six million. ls someone helping himself? It's much simpler than that. Payments due last week... are still due. The cost of Princess Patricia's education reminds me of... the budget of Versailles. Your expenses are taking on gigantic proportions. - Who is it? - Speak of the devil... Raoul Volfoni. It's about time. So you finally decided to come across. You got a fixation! An obsession! I'm just telling you the distillery is in a jam. Better take care of it. It's your job, boss. It's none of your business! That's not fair. You won't even let me do you a favor. Do you think Raoul fell for it? He won't miss a chance to give the other idiot some bad news. It's funny that the strong man hasn't phoned. Some impulsive types pick up the phone. Others come in person. You see. And Volfoni will take the rap. Feel better? This makes one down and one to go. Now, it's merely a matter of patience. Next month, the Volfonis... and the Mexican's racket becomes: Theo, Tomato... and Co. Hide all that. The caveman might not like your perfumed butts. OK, I'm coming! In five minutes... get going. - Hurry up! - I'm coming! It's you, Mr Fernand? Well, don't look so amazed! Volfoni is a fool. I didn't ask him to bother you. I wanted a driver. Well, I'm here now. By the way, you need radar to find this place. I hunted for an hour. The police have been hunting for 10 years and have never found it. That's why I'll regret leaving it. What makes you say that? The weariness of it all. Haven't you ever felt stirrings in your soul? No, I can't say I have. You don't have the same reasons. You won the war. Okay, but I didn't come here to brag about it. So what's going on? This is what's going on. We have a load ready to roll. Six million francs in pastis... and a customer waiting at midnight... in Fontainebleau. We won't deliver. Why not? Our last driver took a job in the Sahara... with an oil company. Overseas allowance... free medical care... Love of money. No sense of values. A driver can be replaced. Running booze requires not only competence... but honesty as well. Unlike the run-of-the-mill deal, payment is immediate... and in cash. A simple mind can be tempted. Well, get in and deliver it yourself. It sounds easy. Why's that? At night on an open road, if an armed man in uniform waves a lamp and tells you to stop, what do you do? I stop, of course. That's why you still have a driver's license. I don't. Are the truck's papers okay? Of course. But you don't intend... For six million francs, I'll intend anything! I can drive anything. Once I even drove a Patton tank. It's not my favorite brand. Where do I deliver? Fontainebleau is a big place. Do you know the Pyramid fork? A black Cadillac will be waiting there. We missed him. Or else the cops picked him up. That would be great! He's just behind schedule. Those windbags are all alike. "I can drive anything ." But not when the chips are down. I think we have a customer. He's going to regret his Patton tank! What are you waiting for? Torch her! That's enough! Yes, the small businessman is washed up. What about the Tomato? If we have to fire him, we will. I know just one law: might makes right. Can't you kick the habit? What's up? Gentlemen, you're on a slippery slope. Your debts are mounting . A truck... and six million in pastis... - Explain. - Some other time. I'm in no mood for a chat. I'm irritable! You still in for 50%? Sure I am. Then open the door. The party began at nine. I don't think we're early, old man. Who invited you... Pat or Antoine? I wonder if he's laying her... Who's laying who? Just a second, sir. The family circle is getting bigger. Just a drop more... You've had enough. Get me another bottle. Where's Patricia? And Mr Folace? In the kitchen. He believes in helping... Look, I feel like a criminal. There you are! And you call this "a little fireside snack!" I want an explanation. Where were you? - With friends. - Commando veterans? You relived the good old days? The raids... the close combat... You played with flame-throwers? Straight or soda? I feel right at home. You said that I could invite some friends. They're all from excellent families. Do you know who he was? Admiral Letellier's son. You want me to get my diploma? Then be logical. A diploma without pull is like a cart without a horse, an omelet without eggs, a niece without her little uncle. It's not worth a thing! Never thought of that, did you? - ls that all? - By the way... what are you thinking about? Montauban. I never should've left! Charming evening, isn't it? Know how much this is costing? Some waste money... others collect it! What do you say to that? Those anchovy sandwiches go like hot cakes. Here are the overdue payments, and with a fine to boot. The Volfonis tried to knock me off. It's not their style. That shows they've changed their style. Yes, you have to keep up with the times. Would they dare to come here? Damn fools dare anything. That's how you spot them. You're sure it's the right joint? I'm always sure... of everything! - Scotch or fruit juice? - Nothing! If this is on our dough, there'll be blood. Hey, you! ls your boss here? Whom do you wish? - Mr Fernand Naudin. - " Mister"! Pain in the ass! Fernand the thief... I call him! - Follow me, gentlemen. - You bet! You coming? Gentlemen, you may enter. Don't make a move. Hands on the table. We got the fire power of a cruiser! Let me relieve you of it, gentlemen. Boys, we're out of sandwiches. Uncle, if your friends want to dance... Hurry, gentlemen. Someone might get the wrong impression. Someone almost did . Know what I ought to do... just for fun? Isn't this getting monotonous? I told you this was the wrong approach. Men of action should give way to diplomats. We're living in an age of discussion and goodwill. What do you think? I don't say no. We didn't come here to butter sandwiches. Why not? Domestic chores can have a certain nobility too. Especially if they lead to fruitful negotiations. Mr Folace, ditch the casus belli. I know human nature, Mr Paul. But to get back to housework, what you said is very pertinent, and it steadies you. How very true! Yes, the devil finds work for idle hands. Where's Jean? Why? We're out of ice and we're out of scotch! Give her some fruit juice. You know what you can do with your fruit juice... Patricia's uncle says there's no scotch. Then buy some... with that! Hands off the lolly, bitch! Drinking at that age! It's a scandal. But we're not minors. We might have a little snort. You can say that again. The fact of the matter is... the kids pirated all the usual merchandise. We'll have to try a new taste thrill. - Oh , memories! - We're saved. Saved? Let's wait and see. You broke out the vitriol? What do you mean? It looks okay. As a first impression, I would say... it looks pretty weird. The Mexican made it when he was in his prime. But we had to stop production. People went blind... It was bad for business. Yes, you can't deny it. It's got body! You're right, it is weird. I knew a Polish girl who drank it for breakfast. But you must admit that it's a man's drink. Know what it reminds me of? The juice we used to drink in a joint near Saigon. Red shutters... and that big blond lady who ran it. What was her name? - Montmartre Lulu. - You knew her? I can taste apples. They're in it. That's where Lucien the Horse got it. You know who did it? I got amnesia! Montreal Teddy. A crazy who only used dynamite. Those were the days. Sulking? Me sulk? Don't be ridiculous. But I'm fed up with clandestine love. Kissing over the telephone even twice a day is very cute, but... I'm a man! It's all your uncle's fault. You all act like you're scared to death of him... I'll talk to him. About what? I'll talk to him... about our marriage. About you, about me... about us! Say that again. About you... About me... Just the first word. I liked that one best. Okay, I'll grant you that, near the end, Jo the Jolter was losing his grip. But during the dark days of the Occupation, nothing could stop him. He even wiped out a Panzer division. Was he running a tank? No, a milk bar. Why don't you listen? I can't think straight. Jo had a secret formula. Where? Down the hall to the right. A sack of spuds, a sack of sawdust... and 25 quarts of Napoleon brandy came out of the still. Jo was a magician. And that's why I feel free to invite... certain disrespectful quarters... to shut their goddam yaps. You can't tell me... there's not just apples in it. There's something else. It wouldn't be sugar beet, would it? They're in there, too. What do they teach you in school, honey? Pretty girls always learn too much. Know how I see your future? You wanna know? I'll tell you anyway. I see an international career... travel... Egypt, for example. Nice place, Egypt. And the best thing is they know... how to treat artists right. Do you want anything , sir? He offered me a trip to Egypt. Oh, I just said Egypt off the top of my head. I might have said... Lebanon! Ah I see! The gentleman is a travel agent? No, darling, the gentleman is a white slaver. But it's nothing unusual. I wish I could get some real food. Your niece is with a jealous guy. I'm talking to her... you know me, ever the gentleman... I know my manners... when this squirt looks for trouble. He used bad words! It's Mister Antoine! Kicking him out the door isn't enough! I guess I'll have to kick him through it! I think it's closing time. Get out! Dowry hunters don't belong here! The French family deserves respect! Over-indulgence excuses over-familiarity. Did we drink? Just apple juice. I'm gonna teach you tact... with my foot on your backside! What were we talking about? Our youth. Wake up! What are you doing here? I must inform you... that Patricia didn't go to school today. Patricia isn't in school. The school just called up. She's going to school. She's going right now. She's gone? That's impossible. You knew her mother... - So? - Heredity. Her mother was always running out. Susie the Smile was a slum kid. At 1 6, she was a star. I don't see the tie-up. We could call the police... The Mexican would spin in his grave! The cops looking for his kid? Sometimes, you're brilliant! Did you see her leave? Yes, at eight... as usual. Notice anything? Yes, sir. Her bags. He tells me this now? It's unbelievable. A kid leaves for school with her bags... and you think it's normal? Go on, boy, go on or he'll break your dirty face... What a bunch of jerks! Thanks for your help. What's that? The license number of her taxi. You're sure it's here? Yes, I had to haul the bags. She's crazy! We always say that when dames walk out on us. Wait for me. Better call another cab. If the lady sees me, I won't look good . No one like a sneak. In our racket, we try not to get mixed up in... the ups and downs of people's romances... I knew a hackie who hauled husbands. This chick turns him into a sieve in broad daylight. - She had a lousy aim. - OK, OK. Don't be too tough on her. Good heavens! Where must a man go to find peace and quiet? To Greenland? I almost had an absolute anti-chord. Absolute! You hear me? The music of the spheres. But that's over your head. Ape man ! Do you mind? Mr Delafoy, when you've finished fixing the plumbing... I expected that! The plumbing! Lowbrow irony! Homespun wit! Victorian sarcasm! Mr Naudin, you may know all about bulldozers and tractors, but... as for your opinions on modern art and music, I advise you to use them as suppositories... and in children's sizes, too! Since you threw me out, I don't see... - Where's Patricia? - I don't see why you're here. Where's Patricia? Here I am , uncle! What are you doing here? What does this mean? As you can see: I cook, I mend, I clean. In short, I'm taking care of Antoine. After all, he's spending the rest of his life with me... Spending his life? You're staying for lunch. Go to the Italian place. We're low on wine. He likes bordeaux or burgundy? I'll get both. Don't you feel well? It's nothing. I'm going nuts, that's all. It's burning! You can come in. Why did you run off like that? You had us worried sick. Why did you throw Antoine out? - Want my opinion? - Yes, now you've tasted it. It needs thyme. I mean... my opinion of your Antoine! " My" Antoine? You're right there. He's marrying me. Let's not lose our heads. Do you love him? Enough to marry him? So much that it's almost indecent. I deserve something tragic, something Spanish... or even Russian! Come on, have a little drink. The hair of the dog. I didn't have a drop. Then why were you up all night? You even took two baths. Just nerves. You won't be home late, will you? I don't want your future in-laws... to get the wrong idea. Your Antoine is very amusing with his airs and graces... but he's got a family like everyone else. The sole survivor of a family shattered by war with the natives, divorce and bad driving... Daddy... Adolphe Amde Delafoy, known as " Mr President". He collects clocks and traffic tickets, disappointments in love and medals! He only lacks the life-saving medal. He yearns for it above all else, but he can't swim . A curious man... A father. His perversions in art are akin to yours. A defender of Puvis de Chavannes and Reynaldo Hahn. I don't know him. He does. Aside from that, he's a great man, with a weakness for religion and waitresses. Know the latest? He's vice-president of the International Monetary Fund. What are you thinking of? The monetary fund ... it's not bad, you know. Happy birthday, uncle! Happy birthday, dear fellow! That means: "Good health and happiness, sir." You're all very nice. Someone brought this. From the Volfoni brothers. Things like this affect a man. It's a nice gesture! It must be a clock... Listen! He's gone. Did you see that? In peacetime! He sings and then: bang! The guy's sick. But I know how to treat his case. I'll give him a prescription... A stiff one! I'll show him who I am! They'll pick him up in little pieces like a jigsaw puzzle! When I'm pushed too far, I'm dynamite! I blow up! I blow away! - We should've stayed home. - Shut up! Make sure he's asleep. ls the big slob asleep? He'll sleep even better in a minute. That joker will hear the angels sing! I'm going to send him back to his maker... a one-way ticket to the factory. The dirty dog. "Truck Fire Puzzles Police" "In the load of bootleg pastis were found... "bottles of gasoline." They burn better. But what you did to the Volfonis wasn't very nice. It wasn't fair. What a laugh! They ambush me, they kill Henri... They didn't. You explain. If the Volfonis had sprayed you and Henri, who would have done it? Me... top gun! And it wasn't you. Theo, our Kraut friend... how do you rate him? He isn't snow-white. Mind running a little errand for me? If the Volfonis are out of it... In that case, we might be interested. You might see Theo out on his country estate. He probably feels like a chat. A nice talk... Since he knows you, he may confide in you. I don't see why he should hide things from us. Neither do I. Unless he wants to tease us. We dropped by the distillery. Theo wasn't there. We ran into the Tomato. Strange, huh? Why was he there? Don't worry. He told us why. Poor Tomato... I didn't think he'd leave us so soon. Well, they spared us the job. ls that all you can think of? This means that the other slob has caught on. It'll be our turn next. But now we've got... the law on our side. - The law? - Self-defense. I don't forgive and forget. Dear fellow... we have visitors. I thought we'd surprise them! What strategy! I won't ask if you can open it. I won't ask if the gentleman can use it. Expecting someone, sir? Do you think it is an enemy ruse, sir? Please announce me to Mr Fernand Naudin. Whom shall I announce? Whom am I to announce, sir? What's the matter? Speak up, my good man. President Delafoy. The father of Antoine Delafoy. I apparently must announce myself. I too am delighted to make your acquaintance. I see that you move fast. I don't dislike that. I approve of action and initiative. In my younger days, I used to play field hockey. Great gods. Late 18th Century! A Ferdinand Berthoud! Gracious! Unless my daughter-in-law insists, I would be glad to make an exchange. Forgive me, I'm anticipating things. Sir, I have the honor... to ask the hand of your niece, Patricia for my son, Antoine. Your spontaneous reply does not surprise me. Well, there we are... This house is delightful. This country air... this silence! Sir, these old homesteads... are absolutely priceless. Didn't I hear... Yes, it's... It's the gardener. He's killing moles. Please tell him to make less noise. I'll do my best, sir. I hope it is a heritage... or a gift. But if you found it in Paris, I shall die. What? This. What's that? Termites! They get into everything! That's the trouble with these old homesteads. Nasty bugs! The goons. On their own, they're bad news. Together, they're a disaster! For once, God is not on our side. But we won't go home empty-handed. I know it's unfair, but it makes me feel better. Absolutely perfect. Not every man can... wear morning dress like this, but you wear it to perfection, sir. You were born to be a diplomat. Just send me your bill right away. I'm leaving town the day after tomorrow. Uncle, it's marvelous. I didn't know we had so many friends. We have more than you think. You look extremely relaxed, Uncle Fernand, glad to be alive. You can say that again. Besides, I'm no longer a legal guardian. As for the businesses that make up Patricia's dowry, your dear father has agreed to run them. Of course, they may be somewhat... eccentric, but a vice-president of the monetary fund can handle them. Dad doesn't understand the past, present or future. He doesn't understand the ways of the world. But he understands everything, when it comes to money. ls it phony? It's the real McCoy. Theo and his boys are back. They're at the distillery. They're loading up to pull out. And you're here? Bastien is on guard. We could've killed 'em painlessly but we thought you had first priority. Some bosses have principles. Tell Patricia that I've an errand to run... and I'll meet them at church. On such an errand, sir, I advise you to go prepared. Do I ever forget anything? Forgive me, sir, today is one of those days... Just go to the church, OK? I spotted 3. There may be more. Do we wait until they come out? Or do we flush them? I'm due at a wedding at 10. Let's get going. Here they come. What's that? We might have to fire a burst... if they come out all at once. You think you're still in the maquis! Why don't you grow up? I told you I was in a hurry! - Boss... - Dammit! The coat will hide it. Do I look OK? That was close...
