What am I playing? Checkered floor on the night and day Death won the game. Three years later For the first time in my life I know who they are. My heart belongs desert. Amman, 1906. British - For years. - Years ? But why venture into the desert, a single woman in wartime. Have you ever been in vain? What does this? I'd like to know something else. What brings you here? Why you left permanently in England, as you say? To be honest, I did neither fully understood. But I I had my moment of revelation. Miss Bell, let me be honest. It sounds pathetic. And what are your intentions? My intentions are to move out there Archaeological and do some research. - Study Bedouins. - Bedouins? Never going to happen this. Remind you that they are under Turkish administration. ask them their permission? No, and I will not ask your permission . Remember one thing. Remember that soon, we intend to inherit their empire I do not want to have problems with our efforts that are underway. You will not spark confrontation with Turkey because the Bedouins. Arguing among themselves. This little adventure to your Is counterproductive and dangerous. You have no power to stop me. - There you go! - Yes. I was already there and get back. Hello, gentlemen! Even though it would cost me Turkish authorities to notify about your plan, Will intercept. This journey naive your not going to happen. - Fattuh. - Yes, Miss Bell. You know, along with the rest of us, we could be arrested all. I'm ready. Even for this? Fattuh is always prepared. Are you arrested. You all are arrested. Lieutenant, can I help you? Who gave you permission to leave at midnight Without a permit from the authorities? - There must be a misunderstanding... - We allowed. - Who are you? - Are Fattuh servant Miss Bell. Miss Gertrude Bell, know who you are. Do you have any weapons? No. We do not have. - This document comes directly... - coming directly from Istanbul. Direct from the ministry. Ms. Bell, I'm a thousand excuses. I got a message from our office in Amman... Yes... probably a man was not informed by your Government. Pathways are like a maze of bureaucracy. It's always the same, even in London. In our foreign office, so... - Really? - Yes Yes. Thank you, Lieutenant. Your horses seem to be thirsty. Want to stay a little time with us? Where did you get permission? I know a scribe main mosque in Amman. Can forge anything for a good tip. Fattuh. Lieutenant. You came from garrison near the rail tracks? Yes, Miss. And how many knights are stationed there? 60. Cam But their number is decreasing. We will be 100 in April. - Do you still have artillery? - It's over. I would have to say that. I'm just a traveler and scientist. Everyone knows Ottoman Empire forces are somewhat overstretched. In fact, everything is on paper, officially. But the outpost is not on paper. Lieutenant. I want to take a picture. You are very kind, lady Bell. - Dv and your people. You agree? - Yes, I would love to. Because you do not want to wear a military secret , I will give negative exposed. - You can get it developed in Aman. - Thank you. I would suggest to stay in the middle. Yes. The light is wonderful. Here. Yards. Dear diary We arrived at an oasis that has something of a fable Bedouin. Desert Solitude gives me consolation in their solitude. Fattuh I asked why I call two glasses of tea. Let's say that one is for man who lives in my heart? Every day before. And it's the same routine installation camp known. But as we sank more than in the desert On so much it seems like a dream. Some days we go lands that are almost impassable. The hard crust of salt, like shards of porcelain. Often do not follow no map, just go where I lead curiosity. East of the Dead Sea Wadi Mujib explored hidden Strait. I never expected to find so fresh water in the desert. The more I immerse more in this mysterious maze , With me was discovering so much. Near the end of the strait, Fattuh found something strange. It has proven to be a spear head Neolithic. For at least 10,000 years. I speculated that prehistoric must have been a war here. And it must have been a very device. Fattuh said But you can not. In that time the world was a paradise. And havens will appear again if you live a life right. As predicted Prophet. Paradise has no time, age or sanctuary. Awaits us. This prompted me to flesh out more archeology. Not far from the strait's British excavation site of Petra. I traveled hard, because of rain early. Regards Welcome, Ms. Bell! Welcome to our home! I'm Campbell Thompson, and he's my colleague T.E. Lawrence. What does "T.E." ? T.E. Edward Thomas comes from. I despise both surname. I'm disgusting. - Please tell me Lawrence. - I will, Lawrence. I knew you were coming. Really? I sent messengers. A variety of stars you saw night Sand during the day and restless announced your steps. Sorry, it is always so. What makes a school like you here, Lawrence? The school has a doctorate in archeology. Thompson... I have a doctorate in medieval pottery shards of And keep me as a fragrance basinii old girls. Long to get rid of it! We? Place that's a pile of garbage. Everything was stolen by grave robbers. Repeatedly. We are stuck here. Lawrence dream big treasure, hoards of gold . Least... God Almighty give us some tablets clay Such as those that have been excavated by the Germans in Mesopotamia. Our methods of excavation compares to theirs. True, Gertrude, dear. "Dear." You know, I made a big mistake wearing this belt. That belt is worn only bachelors. And...? And... local workers working on excavations Tried to find me a bride. Imagine. A wife for me. How horrible! But have heard of your arrival and immediately was spread a rumor that you're my bride, Sent from England. I'm not sure if it was born right man for you. For me Ottoman Empire can not withstand much Look like the Roman before the crash. What do you think would happen? Chaos. Chaos and war. Do you think the British Empire Will take over the helm and will fill the vacuum of power? There are different opinion. I think the spirit of the Arab nation will surface. They are the future. Maybe, but... Any significant change Could take centuries to be carried out. - It will happen in our lifetime... - Ready. Enough with politics. In a few decades. We are archaeologists. Until now I am just a traveler. Then for travelers. And for those who dig mysteries of the earth. Sorry, we do not have glasses. You know, Gertrude? No matter what anybody says, Soft and gentle light of a campfire With a whiskey in hand Make an excellent wedding. Gertie! Have you had breakfast? I'm hungover. I have a headache as the Roman Empire. Too bad we do not have Rome in flames And Nero us play live, crying fire. He himself started the fire to have good mood. - Those were good days. - Lawrence speaks more slowly. Gertie.
