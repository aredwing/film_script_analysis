Oh well, maybe you need your brother to come do it for you. Very funny. Boy, if I miss this because you can't get through that thing, it is gonna be your arse. I'm on it. Slow to 15. We're almost there. Copy that. Slowing to 15. The location looks perfect. slow slow... six, four, two, one, and contact. Attaboy. The pressure's in the green. Looks good here too. Aye, temperature, pressure, head speed... it's all within limits. The storm's really picking up. Jim's gonna make me evacuate. Well, you know the rules, man... women and children first. Oh, the seabed's venting. Looks like we got a blowout. No no, it's a new hole, Colin. They vent all the time. No, this is different. And it's pushing the unit all over the place. Well, are you still on it? Yeah, but it... it looks purple. Purple? I'm off it. Hang on. Something just hit the ROV. Aw, I just lost the light. Okay, we've got another vent. And it's glowing. What's glowing? The venting is glowing. The light is out and I can still see. And it's pooling around the wellhead. Hang on. I'm gonna recycle the light. Whoa, something just hit the... I just lost the feed. Great. You just hit a fish and broke a quarter-million-dollar submersible. Mr. Fleming, sir, I just got an update from the National Weather Service. They've upgraded the storm again. It's getting worse. Freddy. All right, I need a list of all the rigs directly in the path of the storm. - Got it. - Send out an emergency alert to all affected rig OIMs. And I want all handies evacuated by dark. Freddy, I need to talk to you. Yeah, I heard you, but unless the rig's on fire and about to explode, it's gonna have to wait till I finish this. I just need a minute. Look, this is my job, all right? Now let me finish my job and then we can talk about whatever it is you want to talk about. Fine. Sir, the only rig that we have that's in the direct path of the storm is the Charlie rig. Then let's evacuate them first, but all other rigs within 100 miles on either side of the storm evacuated as well. And tell everyone who stays back on those rigs to button down. It's gonna be a rough night. Colin, I think everything's gonna fit in there. What do you want? Uh, you wanted to talk to me, remember? It's too late. Come on, what's up? Nothing. Forget it. Is this about you getting pulled off the rig? I'll talk to Jim if you want me to, but he's just gonna tell you the same thing... all non-essential crew get pulled during a storm like this. Maybe instead of getting bent out of shape you should just work on being more essential. It's not just that, Freddy. I'm tired of being the baby. I don't know if you've looked at that little patch of pubes on your chin recently or not, but you are the baby on the rig. That's not what I mean. Everybody here knows you. They know me as the little Brewer. - What do you want me to do about it? - Nothing. As long as we're both on this rig, I'm always gonna be living in your shadow. And that's not gonna change. Is that what you're so pissed off about? Yeah, it is. When I get back to company base, I'm gonna talk to Ken Fleming and I'm getting off this rig. If that's what you want, I'm not gonna stop you. Yeah, it is. You know what Dad once told me about family? What? He said, "Other things may change but we start and we end with family." I'm still waiting on those wind speeds. It's coming, man. Keep your skirt on. Kilt. I don't have to take that from you. You're nothing but a freaking postie. And I don't take crap from posties. What the hell is a postie? "Thriller," the greatest album of all time, was released in December of 1982. Therefore anyone born after that date is considered post-"Thriller" or a postie and is too young to be capable of giving me crap. Man, first of all, what do you know about good music? Don't you guys listen to bagpipe music? Andrew, give me some numbers. Wind speeds are holding up at 95mph. Mainland's saying we should be through the worst of this by the morning. Assuming we'll make it through the night. Make it through the night? Relax, kid. I've been through You think if there was any real danger, I'd let Carey stay onboard? When I send her home before a storm, that's when it's time to worry. Yeah, well, I was raised riding out storms on wildcat platforms like this. Yeah, and they all had the same name... Hurricane Sarah. Mom is a little more of a tropical depression. Yeah, it was depressing all right. I haven't said it to her yet. But you want to, right? I've never said it to anyone before. That's better than me. I said it to every girl I ever went to bed with. Yeah, but did you mean it? Once. But I married that baby. Wallace, why is the compressor still on? Uh, I don't know. So we're still pumping Tabasco sauce into the rock. Give me Dobbs on the horn. Compressor room. Hey Dobbs, why is the logging unit still on? The logging unit? Sorry, Jim. That's my fault. Well, you mind taking care of that for me right now, please? I really don't feel like having a blowout tonight. Yeah, I'll get on it. I'm sorry, Dobbs. Thanks for covering for me. Look, you stay here and do the trial work. And I'll go outside and take care of it. Hold on, let me finish this up. I'll go with you. Rodriguez, do you copy? Hold on one sec. Let's go already. If you don't like how I do this, you can come down here and do it your goddamn self. Here's what's left of the camera. Oh. Yo, Dobbs, the camera's fucking toast. All right, tell Carey and head back up. What the hell is that? It's fresh poached salmon. I've got a tangy coconut, coriander and chili sauce, fresh asparagus, fresh potatoes. I'll have a burger, burnt. Well, I prepared fresh poached salmon with a tangy coconut, coriander and chili sauce, with fresh asparagus and fresh potatoes. VirgiI, you rock. Okay, so navy boy likes it. Army. Special forces. You wouldn't believe the things I've had to eat. You got a ham sandwich back there, right? - What's for dinner? - Some kind of fish, I think. Everything secure on the starboard side? The camera was torn apart, but I found this in the casing. Earl already come through here? No. Wasn't he with you? Control room. No, he hasn't been down here. Yeah, I'll let you know if I hear from him. All right. Bye. Who was that? - Dobbs. - What did he want? Just wanted to know if we'd seen Earl, said he hasn't come down from the logging unit yet, wondered if we'd heard from him. The compressor's still on. Where is he now? He's in the galley. Dad. My father's coming to you. I'm sorry. What's wrong? - Jim's coming up here, isn't he? - Yeah. I don't care what he says. I'm hungry. And I haven't eaten all day. I'm finishing my food today. You'd better eat fast. Stop pacing. You're just gonna get yourself all worked up. I'm already worked up. Maybe he wouldn't be so hard on you if you weren't nailing his only daughter. Does everybody know about me and Carey? Yeah. So I guess Jim knows? That's a safe bet. Where is Earl? He went down to turn the compressor off. He hasn't come back in yet. You sent him out there alone? Why the hell didn't you go with him? All right, that's it. I want you and Rodriguez outside right now looking for him. The rest of you... I want you to scour this ship up and down. That goes for you too, Virg. Come on, let's go. Earl. Yo. Are you in here, man? Earl. Yo, Earl. Oh, whoa whoa, what have we here? Jesus, Earl. Nice. Nothing yet. We're gonna go check the logging unit. Earl. Earl. Earl? Earl. Earl, are you back here? You were scared, eh? It's not funny. Hey, it's payback for the ham sandwiches. Man... wait till I tell everybody about this. The logging unit was never shut down. He never made it that far. Meet me in my office. Hello. - Hey, Colin, it's me. - Hey. Hey. I just wanted to make sure you got to the operations center okay. Yeah, I'm fine. I thought about what you said earlier and... do you really want off the rig? Yeah, I'm gonna talk to Mr. Fleming about it in a few minutes. All right. For what it's worth, I'm sorry that things didn't work out the way we'd hoped. If you really want to do this I guess I understand. Colin, you're my little brother, okay? You're my responsibility. If I was driving you nuts... ...it's just because I love you. Freddy? Colin? Colin, are you there? God damn it. - Copy? - I've got nothing over here. Man, nothing over here too. We lost comms. Well, we knew that was a possibility. No need to panic. - Famous last words. - You pansy. All right, well, I'm gonna go check the eco report from the new satellite. So if anything else comes up, you guys let me know. Will do. Have a seat. We lost contact with the mainland. So we're not gonna be able get any help looking for Earl untiI after the storm passes. I want you to take a look at this. What is it? It's a letter I had to send to the family of a good man I lost nine years ago. You ever have to send a letter like that? You ever met Earl's wife Jeannie? A hell of a woman. He's got a daughter Sophia. She's 12 years old, a beautiful child, smart as a whip. What do you want me to say? I want you to understand that when you lead people in a place like this that your actions and decisions can have long-ranging repercussions that can affect the lives of people you never even met before. Now we've got rules and protocol for a reason. And when you break 'em, I gotta write letters like this to little girls who are gonna grow up without a daddy. You need to start taking responsibility seriously, son. Now go on, get the hell out of my office. - Oh. - Yeah. Thanks, man. Oh, that's wonderful. Mm-hmm. And I can open a freaking window in here. I know. Smells like kangaroo pouch. It's pretty bad. It's about to get worse too. Aren't you a bit old to be reading comic books? You know what? First off, they're not comic books, okay? Pay attention. These are graphic novels. They're a little different. And no, I'm not. I'll be back in five. Hey, take your time, man. You don't want to rush with that. Come in. Hey. I don't think your father likes me very much. Yeah, I know he can be a little direct. Yeah. You find out what happened to that camera? No. Everything turn out all right with the eco report? Yeah, we're clean. It's just... I don't know, these readings don't make any sense. So we're drilling in a bad area? The equipment's working correctly, but it's bringing back this... yeah, I don't know. Right. One more thing. Come on, come on. Baby. Nice nice. Yeah, Papi. Come on, Papi. Give it to me hard. Yeah. Come in. Mr. Fleming, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, but make it quick. I'm Colin Brewer, information systems on Charlie rig. I was gonna see... I was hoping to get assigned to another rig. You want to get off Jim's rig? Yes, sir. That's gotta be a first. Sit down. I've got a list of people trying to get on that rig and you want to get off it? Why? Well, it has nothing to do with the way Jim runs his rig. It's more family-related. What did you say your last name was? - Brewer. - Related to Fred Brewer? Yeah, Freddy's my brother. I know Freddy. He's a good man. Jim speaks very highly of him. If you're half as valuable as Fred, well, Jim's gonna be very disappointed to see you go. Colin, right? I understand something about working with family. So I want you to sleep on it. And if you feel the same way tomorrow, we'll talk about it then. Deal? - Deal. - Get out of here. Thank you, sir. I'm sorry about Earl. Me too. We work in a dangerous place. I know. So I guess there's not much I can say to make you feel better. No. Hmm. Mm, you smell like a roughneck. I am a roughneck. I know. I like it. Carey, open up. I need to talk to you for a minute. Dad, hang on a second. Who were you just talking to? No one. Wait, Dad. - He knows? - Yeah. I gotta go talk to him. Excuse me, do you think you're done with your workout? I'm just taking a breather. You'd better be. Dad, you can't possibly be upset. You knew about us. Sweetheart, I'm your father. I've got every right to be upset. I think I'm capable of making my own choices. I know that. Look, it's just that... What? I want something more for you than this. Is this where you tell me that no man is good enough for his daughter? Oh no, there is a man out there who's good enough for you, - but it's just not him. - He's a good guy. I know that. Sweetheart, this has nothing to do with him. How are you holding up? I'm all right. That bad, huh? I've been around, Dobbs. Things happen. You're not supposed to like 'em. I know. One time in the Philippines we were supposed to free up a group of American and British hostages. As we were advancing, one of our guys took a bullet to the head... killed him instantly, a lucky shot really. He was my friend. One moment he's just moving ahead of me, the next moment he's gone forever. We're not at war, Faulkner. It's an oiI rig. It's just a job. See, that's not the point. Bad things will happen to you in your life. It is how you respond to them that's going to determine your character from the day you're born till the day you die. But that doesn't make it any easier. It never does. You're a good person, Dobbs, with a lot of potential. If I didn't think so, I wouldn't be wasting my breath on you. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. Are you gonna read that book all night or do you want to play some cards? Now, see, I want to take your money. I want more for you than to end up the wife of an oilman. This is a hard life. We're away for weeks at a time. It's hell on a woman. Look what it did to my marriage. Okay, no, first of all, I'm not Mom. And second, there's a long way to go for me to get married. Good. Dad. Honey, I'm just trying to give you some advice and a few things that I learned in this life. I mean, that's what fathers are supposed to do. You've got a bright future ahead of you and I want you to make the most of it. I know you do. And one other thing... when you see Dobbs... this rig is like my house. What goes on here goes on under my roof. And you two need to respect that. Of course I do. Get over here, you doe-eyed smartass. Go on, take a walk. I'm busy. All right. I love you, Dad. I love you too, baby. I assume you took care of everything and he loves me now. Not quite. I'm his daughter. This is his rig. What do you expect? See, that's a good girlfriend... getting us some brownies. Aw, honey. They're not for you. Oh, how did you get so many kings? I fold. - Having fun? - Mm-hmm. I hate this game. Dad. Help me! Kyle, please help! Help! Help! It's my dad. - Where is he? - In his office. - The window. - Please. Please. Let's get her out of here. Do you think this has something to do with Earl? I think it definitely has something to do with Earl. I'll call the crew up. Sweetheart, I'm your father. I've got every right to be upset. I think I'm capable of making my own choices. No, first of all, I'm not Mom. - Where is he? Where is he? - Come on. No one's answering from the control room. Try the gym. No one's answering. I'll try the galley. Then where is everybody? I don't know. Well, we have to go check the rig. We're going to search the rig, make sure everybody else is okay. Take whatever you can as a weapon. You don't know who we'll be meeting out there. Let's go. Hey. - You got a problem? - What's with the lamp? What have you guys been doing? Exercising. What's wrong with you guys? How long have you guys been here? I don't know. An hour and a half, two hours. We think Jim is dead. You think? It looks like someone killed him. What do you mean, someone killed him? There's blood all over his office and the blood traiI leads out the window. If you guys are pulling some kind of joke, this isn't funny. No, it's not a joke. What did the mainland say? The radio is out. We're gonna go to the control room next. Well, we're not doing any good here. Jesus. It's just like Jim's office. Help me over here. Something's blocking the door. - Andrew. - Freddy? What the hell are you doing? Oh man, I'm sorry, dude. I didn't know that was you. A life vest? Really? It was all I had. What? Did you guys kill that thing? What thing? What the hell are you talking about? The thing, man. I saw it kill Wallace. I've never seen anything like it before, man. It had claws. It kind of looked like the Mexican chupa thing. You know, the Mexican thing. I'm Puerto Rican, asshole. Okay, whatever it was, it was fierce. It tore Wallace apart. Why didn't it get you? Because I ran. I dived into here. I just barely got away. Where did it go? I don't know. We have a security camera. Maybe we can see it on one of those. Wait. There, the lower right-hand corner. I don't see shit. Try another camera. Maybe we'll get a better image. This is camera C, portside aft corner, at roughly the same time. That's it. That's what I saw. What the hell is that thing? I told you guys. When is the rest of the crew coming back? When the storm ends. Well, the weather service said that the storm should pass through by morning. Maybe that thing will just go away. Obviously we didn't bring it out here with us. - Well, then what the hell is it? - Does it matter? He's right. How are we gonna kill that thing? There's a speargun next to the scuba gear. It'll have to do. No, my dad has a gun. It was a gift from my uncle when he got the rig. He keeps it in his state room. So let's go get it. Stick together, no stragglers. I'll take the lead. Faulkner, you and Freddy watch the rear. Hey hey, fuck you, no. Women are not gonna be in the middle. No offense, Andrew. Whatever, man. I don't mind being in the middle. I'll take the lead. You cocksuckers try and keep up. It's locked. This way. We need to keep moving. Where's the gun? It's in the box on the desk. Nice. What is that? A trigger lock. Great. It doesn't do us much good like that. Check the desk. There's nothing here. Wait, it's probably on his keychain. He always keeps it on a hook in his office. Why don't you all go up ahead? I'm going to go get that speargun. We need to stick together. No, I need to be on my own. Look, I don't know what this thing is, but it's not here for food. It likes to kill us. And it's doing it one by one. Character, Dobbs. I hunt alone. Stick together. Like he says, you're safer as a group. We can't worry about him. We need that key. Hey, instead of running around, how about we just go to the control room and barricade ourselves in? We will, but we need this gun for protection. Let's go. If we cut through here, we'll get there faster. Let's do it. Gotcha. - Wait here. - No no, I'm going in. Do you know where he keeps them? The thing about my dad... a creature of habit. I love you, Dad. I love you too, baby. Got it. We gotta go. Are we good? Yeah, we're good. We've still got to check in on VirgiI. Hey man, why don't we just go lock ourselves in the control room like you said? You go wait in the control room. We'll meet you there. Wait up. Rodriguez, Andrew, watch the front while we search the place. Watch the front? Don't be such a sissy. Wait, at least give me the gun. Listening to Dobbs is gonna get us killed, I'm telling you. Who elected him the leader? You're, like, the wussiest person I've ever met. - Chicken. - I'm not a chicken, okay? - Yes, you are. - No, I'm not. What was that? I don't know. What are you doing? Don't go down there. Shh. Stupid. You hear a noise, you're gonna go down there and check on it? Fine. You're right. Of course I'm right. If anything, you should be going away from the noise. Run! Run, Andrew! Run! Help! Guys guys guys! It's out here! No. - Why didn't you help her? - I tried. - You liar! - I did. She told me to run. That's her blood. That's enough! Come on, that's enough. You little shit. Whoa whoa, where are you going? I'm gonna find this thing and I'm gonna kill it. Freddy, please. What the hell, man? Easy. Over here. - Careful. - It hurts, man. It hurts. Easy. - I got it. I got it. Here. Hey. I'm sorry. Well, what do we do now? We sit here and wait. This thing's not gonna leave us alone. We're safer in here than we are out there. He's not going anywhere like that. I just don't like being boxed in here like this. Guys. He's having an allergic reaction. We have to get him an adrenalin shot now. In the sickbay? Yeah. Damn it. He's struggling to breathe. If we don't... I know. I'll go get it. I'll go with you. Well, I can get on the monitors and watch for this thing. What about you guys in here? Take the gun. We'll be fine. We'll get you help, Andrew. Hang in there. We need to go under the rig. What? We need to go under the rig to avoid this thing. It's longer, but it's the safest way. Carey, we're going under the rig. I don't have cameras under there. I know. Shh. Jeez, where have you been? You're being hunted. Keep moving. Okay, I've got it portside. Stay out of that area. There's another one. What? There's two of them. They got Faulkner. - Is this it? - Yes yes. Give him the shot. Is he gonna be all right? I don't know. You didn't happen to get any bandages for his leg, did you? I thought I'd ask. What happened? Easy. Get him up! Come on, come on. Okay, here we go. Move. Andrew. He's dead. Shit. Okay. Here here. Come on, come on, come on. Shh. Shh. - It's clear. - Are you sure? It went over the side. - Do you think it's gone for good? - I doubt it. What the hell do we do now? We gotta kill it. Or it's gonna kill us. How? I'm gonna wait up on the helicopter pad with a bunch of pipes and knives. And when it comes, I'm gonna go to town on that motherfucker. We could. But I doubt pipes and knives are gonna do the trick. Well, aren't there some chemicals or something we can use? This is an oiI rig. We gotta have something. A bunch of metal tools. You want to throw wrenches at it? No. I don't know. What about natural gas? You want to blow the rig? - I like it. - No no no no. We pump gas into an area, we lure the thing in there, and we burn it to a crisp. - Yeah, we can do that too. - Yeah, I can get the rig online. We can redirect the gas to whatever line we want. - How long will that take? - 15-20 minutes. Good. Freddy, we need some flare guns. We have that in the emergency kit. All right. How are we gonna lure it there? One thing at a time. Let's get moving. Oh! Fucking... Fucker. Fuck you. No flare gun. Found the flares. It'll have to do. Be careful that doesn't go off by accident. Good call. How are we doing? Almost there. So how are we gonna lure it in? Well, I figured you and I keep watch on the drill deck. Carey, you watch the monitors. When we see this thing, we use ourselves as bait. That's what I was afraid of. Okay. Kyle. I love you. I love you too. Good luck. Thanks. You too. I don't suppose we could hope this thing gave up on us. I wouldn't count on it. Guys, I got something. What is it? Movement on the northeast corner. Freddy, that's you. I don't see anything. It was just a shadow, but it was definitely movement. I've got an idea. I'm gonna kill this thing. - Carey, what do you see? - I don't know. I've lost it. Freddy! Freddy! Freddy! Carey, I'm coming to you. What? Where's Freddy? He's gone. I'm coming to you, and coming to you fast. Are you okay? Listen, we can still kill this thing, all right? Yeah. We can do this. - Let's go. - Uh-huh. Run! Oh shit. Charlie rig, this is Weyland base command. Roger that. The weather is clear. What's your ETA? - It's rescue 1-5. - I'll take it. Rescue 1-5, this is Ken Fleming at base. Copy, Mr. Fleming. This is 1-5. We're approaching Charlie rig now. Do you see any of the crew? Sir, I've got one person on the helipad. It's a female, Caucasian. Carey. Anyone else, 1-5? Sir, this is Rescue 1-5, copy. Go ahead, 1-5. Sir... the girl is hysterical, sir. She's saying the crew is dead. She says they're all gone. John, get her back here, okay? Okay. This is base. The rig's systems are offline. It looks like a substantial blow. And as soon as everybody gets on site, you call me. Colin, come in here. John, excuse us. What's going on? I gotta be straight with you, son. We just got an automatic emergency message from your rig. Colin, I'm sorry. I should have stayed. No. You did exactly what you were supposed to do. Your brother did exactly what he was supposed to do. I know these rigs. And I know Jim. The storm did not cause that explosion. That rig was blown for another reason. - And I'm gonna go find out why. - I'm going. No, you're staying here. I have to go. I have to bring my brother home. God. Oh my God. Colin. Colin. Freddy! Freddy. Colin! That's for my brother, you ugly son of a bitch. Are you still looking for that transfer? 'Cause I'm coming with you.
