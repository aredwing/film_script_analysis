We'll write to each other. You have my address, don't you? Then everything's fine. Off you go. We'll all miss you, Teacher Dllek. -Good luck in Istanbul. -Give your mother my best. Have a good holiday, Miss. You're all sad. Come here. Selma, the sun's out, let's walk. Lale! Don't splash me! Ready? Stop it! We win! What? -My turn again! -No way. I want another go. No way! You cheated. No, we didn't. It's not fair. -You cheated! -No, we never! Give her another go. Everyone gets just one go. Take your turn! Let me go! Let me go! I can't reach. I was going to hip you. Look, they've grown all of a sudden! Show me your boobs. What are you doing in my garden! Clear off! We've one taken a few apples. Get out of my garden! -OO, we're going. -Calm down. Sonay, as you're the eldest, I'll start with you. Grandma! Sonay! Grandma, open the door! Grandma? Sonay, are you OO? Your turn now. Selma! Open the door! Grandma, open up! Grandma, open the door! -Get out! -What's this all about? -Ece, come here. -What did we do? It was just a few apples. Everyone's talking about your obscene behaviour. What? Rubbing up against boys' necks. What? On the beach. Rubbing your parts on boys' necks! We were on their shoulders, it was a game... There's no such game! Who toady you this? -Ece, come here. -Who told you? Come here! Mrs Petek called me to tell me what you were up to. How could she? My granddaughters, pleasuring themselves on boys' necks! What? You're depraved! Come here! Get out! I can't watch you all day Ion. You're disgusting! Get back! Grandma, stop it! Nur, what are you doing? What are you doing? These chairs touched our arsehoIes! That's disgusting! Have you gone mad? Come here! Come back! Mrs Petek! Girls! Mrs Petek's at the market. Lale! Mrs Petek! Do your shit-coloured clothes make you everyone's moray judge? What are you doing? -I did it for your own good. -No! Yes! I'm sorry, Mrs Petek. Please forgive them. Straight home! Now! What am I going to do with you? That's enough, Mum. Enough! You've been saying that for years. ''Give them their freedom, they're just children.'' -It's true. -What's true? Their parents have been dead a decade now. -Be more understanding... -About what? They've grown up. Can't you see? You know what people are saying? Don't listen to gossip. Do you know what they do? You think you're helping them? How can you tic like this to your own mother? I'll show them! Where are they? Watch your Language. Lay, Nur, out! Out! Calm down. Which one is it? -Calm down. -Or is it all of you? -Which one? -Calm down. Which one acts like a whore? Or is it all of you? Teasing the boys, eh? Is it you? Mum! -They've done nothing wrong! -How do you know? -I know. -How can you be so sure? They're my granddaughters. If they're sullied, it's your fault. I'll prove it to you. Claim down. They've always done just what they want. -How can you fix that? -Do you think it's easy? I lost my sons. I understand. But it was a Long time ago now. Pull yourself together. I've raised them by myself for years. I understand. But Errol is right. He has every reason to be angry. It's come to this because you didn't do your job right. What are you Looking at? Spit out that gum! Ece, Sonay, Seaman, come with me. Selma. -What did they do? -A virginity report. What's that? -Did you strip naked for the doctor? -Yes. He said I had nothing he hadn't seen before. It's true. We're all made the same. No. You've got one boob bigger than the other! We didn't need to go to the doctor's. We told you. If there was the slightest doubt, you'd never be abide to get married. After that, the doors to the house were always locked. Anything likely to pervert us was banned. What? Which road? All right. The bastards! Mum, will you take these iris in hand, or do I have to? Sonay, you're mine Welcome! -Jump... -I'm going to fall! You won't fall. She's falling. My baby's born! Move your feet! Your order is here. Your toe dessert from foot word! -I didn't order anything. -It's your order! There's been a mistake. A mistake? Put a vine Leaf on your pirate... The house became a wife factory, that we never came out of. Watch... If you overstuff them, they go soft, which isn't good. No one likes a soft dime. Don't burst the peppers. It has to be nice and round. Watch carefully. Yes, you're doing it well. That's very good. There's nothing you can't do. Keep turning it. You watched me do it, right? There, that'll be perfecta round. Well done. Shall we show the others? Straight towards you. You'll all learn how to do this. Careful with the knife. Ece, it's your turn. Well done, iris. Spread it out evenly. Come here. Now it was our turn to wear shapeliness, shit-coloured dresses. A few basic principles about soup. Made from a proper broth, it has more taste. You can adios improve the flavor and nutritional value with certain preparations. In front of my house! I'll Kelli him! ''Sonay, you're mine''? Lale! That's enough! Get out! What are you doing here? Once the milk takes on this consistency, add the sugar and the gum. A measure of seep... Pour it into these moulds, put it in the fridge, and once it's cooled you'll have chewing-gum! I'm going to faint! Help, I'm stuck! Hang on... Watch it! How are we going to get the dress back? Did it fey out? What's that? Chewing-gum. Really? Where did you get it? -We made it. -How? The best chewing-gum ever! It's a bit sticky. You know what? We can improve these dresses. That's better. -Nice. -Tear it a bit more. All the way up. Wear it Like that. -Strike a pose! -Like this? Ouch, my ear! Where did you go? The beach. What were you doing at the beach? Mind your own business. Go and put some cloths on! It's only us here. What if your uncles saw you? They're out. Let me breathe! Come here! I'll Kelli you! You think it's funny? Nick my stuff again, I'll rip your head off! Take it off! He lost the third tray and he wants to appeal again. What do you want? To ask you a favor, Uncle. Yes? It's the Super League quarter finals on Friday. So? Can I come to the match with you? Do the others want to come too? They don't like football. You can't be among all those men. I asked Grandma. She didn't say no. -What did she say? -That it's up to you. That it's up to me? She knows I've followed all the matches, that I know all the teams and the players. It'll be my East season. What does she say about the men who invaded the pitch on Saturday? And all the fighting? It's out of the question. Shame on him. Shame on him! Is that how a man behaves? Don't get all worked up. Think of your blood pressure. Drink some water. Did you know about his wickedness? Suzanne, answer me. Did you know what your son was doing? No. Goalie! Following the pitch invasion which caused the match to be suspended, the Turkish Football Federation has announced that Trabzonspor's match on Friday will be off-Limits to men. Trabzonspor will be the next team to pay to a solely female crowd. Women only for the home match against Galatasaray. Women know how to support their team and make plenty of noise... We have to go to that match! In your dreams! The most devoted supporters are already queuing for their tickets. I was here at dawn. -You waited for 4 hours? -Yes. I'm grateful to the men! What's going on? Coming to the match? -Are you going? -All the girls in the village are. They've organised a bus to take us. Where does it go from? In front of the cafe, at 4. We'll say we're sick. They'll think we're in bed. I'm in! When did you start liking football? I don't care about the match, I want to get the hell out. We can make heads to put under the covers. It hasn't even got any hair! Quiet! We can't go that way in broad daylight. And it's a long way down. You're mad! They'll skin us alive. At least something will happen. -I'm stuck! -What do you mean, stuck? -It hurts! -Push yourself. -I can't! -Why can't you? -Get out! -I can't! Get out! Lale's got no boobs so she can get through. It's not your boobs, it's your fat bum jammed in there! Be quiet! Up here. Give us a hand. -Hurry up! -I've got you. Can you give me a hand? Go on, Ece. -Nur won't get up with her fat bum! -Shut up, shorty! Pancake chest! Don't push! Come on, Selma, hurry up! Wait for us! Stop! It's all your fault! If you hadn't been scared of a fly... It was a great big wasp! You can't even walk properly! Stop it, Lale! She fell. What are you doing in the middle of the road? We missed the bus for the match in Trabzon. Help us catch it up. Are you mad? No! -Take us! -No way! -Please! -No. Stop! Thank you so much. Erol, the cable's too short. Are we going to miss the match because of a cable? What's the matter? What the hell? There's Light at Durmus Emmi's. We'll drink here after. I only found out later what Aunt Emine did for us. Quiet! The fallout from our escape wasn't what we expected. Stand up straight. Put your sleeves down. Show your face. That's good. Your hair needs fixing. Done it? Ready? We're going out for lemonade. Don't drag your feet. We'll sit here. Come here a second. Wait... Walk over to the fountain -and back again. -What for? Just go and walk while I order the lemonade. She wants us to drink here? It's a foot fountain! Grandma started by showing us off. A few days later some workers came. Press down hard on the rug. Lale, do you hear me? Couldn't you have talked to me about it first? You're not always here. I called the workers. They're raising the walls a bit. Now the house really did look like a prison. Get this ball out of here! Play somewhere else! Grandma, we've got visitors. Visitors? Do your hair. And go get dressed. Sonay? Selma? Look how you're dressed! Put some clothes on! Bare feet too! Hurry, Lale, you come and get dressed too. Quick, quick, quick! It's so hard to raise children nowadays. That's true. Here she is. God bless her, she's beautiful! She's one of a kind! Sonay, will you serve the tea? Grandma, I want a word. Excuse me, pleased. I Love Eking. If you try to marry me off to anyone else, I'll scream. What? All right! All right, all right. But if you want to see him again, he'll have to ask for your hand. Finally Selma will serve the tea. A beautiful girl too. You Like her? Yes, God bless her. She's one of a kind too. Go on, serve the tea. Osman, the lady's son, has just done his military service. I'd love all my granddaughters to be married while I'm still alive. What is the young man doing now? Welcome, Osman. Thank you. Come and sit here. Do you know each other? By sight. How are you? Good, and you? Very well, thank you. Do you like her, Osman? They're still so young and shy. But they'll grow fond of one another. With time, God willing. Shall we ask the men to join us? To settle the matter. Right now? Why not? The children seem to like each other. Welcome. Good evening. Go and fetch some more chairs. It seems the children like each other and the women are agreed. With God's blessing and the Prophet's word I ask for your daughter's hand for our son. Very well. It's agreed. It's agreed. Osman, your ring. Congratulations! At least that was settled. And while we were at it... We could watch some matches together. Who do you support? The national team! Do you drink alcohol? No. With God's blessing and the Prophet's word, I ask for the hand of your daughter for our son, with your full consent. If God wills it, we have nothing to say. Two down. Lale, I have to take your measurements too. -Grandma... -Yes, my child? Where do I put these? In Sonay's chest. Those are Selma's. We'll keep these for Ece's wedding. -Ece's wedding? -Of course. All About Sex Do I really have to sleep with Osman? Straight away? Why are you so worried? You're not a virgin? Of course I am! You can tell me. No, honestly. Listen... Me and Ekin make love but I'm still a virgin. How? We do it the back way. The back way? So I stay a virgin and no chance I'll get pregnant. If my mother had a boat, she'd sail it to me If my father had a horse, he'd ride it to me If my brothers and sisters knew where I am They'd come looking for me... They're coming! Come on, girls! They're here! Get ready. Where are the veils? Sonay! -Where are you? -I'm here. Put your veil on, they're here. Where's the veil? Hurry up! Hanife! Put her veil on, quick! Erol? Are you coming? -Welcome. -Wait a minute! Wait. At a wedding, the girl's family plays hard to get. Sit on those chests, girls. Don't surrender too easily. Now we're playing hard to get? My love! What's the matter? If you don't want to marry Osman, run away. How? Just get in a car and go. Where? To Istanbul, like everyone. It's And I can't drive. Goodbye. Stop it, you'll make me cry. It was the last time we were all together. -Did it hurt? -Yes. -What was it like? -Bumpy. Aunt Emine said it'd be hard at first, but that I'd get used to it. Did you bleed a lot? Not at all. Osman, my son, we're waiting. Osman, are you going to show us the sheet? Coming! I swear I'm a virgin. -So where's the blood? -I don't know. Show us the sheet. Just a minute! What do I tell them? Where is it? Good evening. We just married our son and the girl didn't bleed. Your husband doesn't seem very romantic. I don't know him that well. You weren't a virgin, then? That'll stay be I slept with the entire world. Are you sure? -About what? -Sleeping with the entire world. I must have slept with someone and forgotten. -Your hymen's right here. -How? It happens. It's just the way you're made. It'll break sometime. With your husband, or giving birth. But I can see it there. It wouldn't have resisted ''the entire world''! Why do you say things like that? I don't know. It's late. I'm tired. When I say I'm a virgin, no one believes me. Why won't you all leave me alone? -What's going on? -They've come to ask for Ece's hand. Tell them, ''You want coffee? Get it yourself!'' Then slam the door and go. Open this. Did they bring it? Lale, what are you doing? I'll slap you! Get out! Don't walk on the biscuits! Put that salt down! Be quiet! Don't push me. Ece is one of a kind. She's so helpful. Thank you. Elegant... When it was Ecos turn, at first she went along with it. Then she started behaving dangerously. Another match? Where are you going? I'm leaving. Going where? Istanbul. On foot? Get in, I'll take you home. No way. You're right. It'll only take you about nine or ten days. And you're in luck. Muddy slippers are all the rage in Istanbul. Open up! Maybe it was the fresh air, but it felt Like returning to the nut-house. I used to kiss the soles of my mum's feet. She made a fuss about it. I said, ''Mum, don't pull your feet away. ''That's the fragrance of paradise.'' Sometimes she cried. That's how mothers are. Coming for a swim? Easy! You'll end up a fat cow at your wedding! Some will understand, others won't. Feminists won't. They refuse motherhood. One, two, three! I'm going to dive under the water. Don't spit at me! I'm down really deep. Lale, where are you? I'm coming to find you. Look, I found a seashell. Listen. Not in front of my door! You've put bars everywhere. Aren't you coming back to school? I'm going to the bank. Stay here. What's that? -Shall I beat those boys up? -No. Hang them up by their feet? No, don't bother. Where are you going? Across the street. Gaven TraveI Istanbul, Ankara, Samsun Warn me when Errol comes back. Why are you out of the car? Now we're here, can we have an ice-cream? We don't have time. Later. I leave you two minutes and everybody's out. And why did you close the windows? Ece? I want you! Is that you, Ece? It's the guy who got in the car. I've been taking to my mates about you all night. Come into my arms, Ece! I want you! Idiot! Did he follow us? How does he know where we Live? I toady him. Erol, do you hear that? There are people in the garden. Go and see. Are you mad? Get the hell out of here! Gris? Stop! Teach me how to drive a car. I've tried Loads of times. I press down, the engine revs but it doesn't move. Show me how to do it. I cued get in big trouble hanging about with you. And me? You think I should be here with you? Turn the wheel... Nice and genii. Come off the brake. Well done. Don't let the clutch out suddenly. Do it gradually. Accelerate a bit. Not all at once! That's it. What's this? The horn. Watch it! Accelerated. More! Very nice. Huge progress with your shoes, at Least. Women must be chaste and pure, know their Limits, and mustn't laugh openly in public, or be provocative with every move. Women must guard their chastity! Where are the girls who blush when you look at them? What's this? A bunch of these! Can you read between the Lines? What's going on? Leave the tabbies. Go away! All right. Finish your meal. Serif, get the girls away from here! Darling, we're going. Selma, your husband's waiting too. Lale... Thank you. Don't you want to leave? Where to? We could go to Istanbul. Istanbul... I want to get out of here. If we get caught, they'll murder us. We'll do it right. No one will know we're gone until we're far away. What have you done to your hair? It's hot. Get up and take the iris out. They're hot. What were you doing? I asked you a question! Stop that! Stop it right now! Not sleeping? I was thirsty. Not sleeping? Yes, I am. It's nice to see you working hard like this. You do it really well. You're a woman now. It'll soon be time for you to marry. -What? -You're a young woman now. I got married when I was your age. There were special circumstances too. Married? Me? -Yes, you. -Marry who? There'll be plenty of suitors once you're ready. I didn't know my husband at all. But I grew to Love him.
