No. It looks like some sort of hallucinogenic amanita. Is it? - You'll watch over this place. - More are gonna grow, don't worry. I never worry, anyhow. Never. I know. What is it? Maybe a friend. No, honey... You can't touch Balthazar. It's a pretty name, isn't it? - You come for a walk? - No, my love. Not now. Gaetan... You've been fishing again! Answer me! You know it makes me feel sad. I put them back to the water. I swear. They suffered for nothing. Hello, darling. Wait, I'm all wet. - You're beautiful like this. You think so? I'm frightening myself. I look like an old hag. I heard you come back. You probably didn't sleep much. No, my lifestyle's too much. And I have to be at the office before 10. I didn't hear you get up. - I left at 7. I had to see the boarding school's kids. - Can you give me my comb. In the box. Thanks. Stop it, I'm gonna be late! I'll try to be back for dinner. Mrs Combe. Don't be afraid, honey, the doctor won't hurt you. Isn't it, doctor? - Please be seated. Say, big girl... Hey, that's a nice dress you've got. - The other day, Hlne slapped me. - Who's Hlne? She's my friend but she's naughty: she slapped me. Suzanne, don't bother the doctor. She slapped you because you did something wrong to her? No, I did nothing. So, you slapped her back. No, I already slapped her back, before! Excuse me. Yes. Mrs Benson. No, I can't. I have patients this morning. Okay, I'll try to come in the evening. No, I can't now. Excuse me. You're listening at the doors, now? No, mummy, I was going to my room. You could had step in. You know I've nothing to conceal you. Why were you calling doctor Calder? I've nothing to conceal you, angel, but I hate when you ask questions. What Dr Calder has done to you? Nothing. I'll see you later, honey. Yollande, you call this one. Darling, I can't come back. I've plenty more appointments and Ludovic is gonna be shooting until late. Come and meet us at 11 for dinner. - The people from Air-Inter are waiting. - Yes, I'm coming! What? Please, do that for me. We'll go at the Courthouse to eat fondue. Okay? See you later, darling. You'll be one of the few men for whom I opened this door. I didn't choose to explore the irrational. I always lived a bit... in a different world. I try to express this world. You maybe go a bit too far sometimes. Let's not make too much of it. Be careful with certain drugs, anyway. I'm not afraid to die. The day mirrors will reflect a too unpleasant image... How is your wife? - Very well, thank you. I sometimes see her driving her new car. She's making a lot of money, now. Yes. Excuse me, it's nothing of my concern. We should never speak about money. Seat down. She mostly has a lot of work. Too much for you? Maybe. You're married since at least three years, I think. It will make three years in one week. The 13th on august. Marriage... What a strange institution. But... I think you've been married too? It's not sure. Gaetan is the fruit of a meeting with a spirit evil enough to surprise me. I anticipated this vogue of single mothers. I had a mother a bit single too. My father died in 1940, during the war. It must have been terrible for you. I was very young. I didn't understand. My mother hold it against me because I didn't cry. But she also took comfort very quickly. She was right. We don't make love with the dead. You had a favour to ask me? Do you know that? No. I found it this morning. There's numbers of mushrooms we forgot the properties. I'd like you to have it analysed. - But why do you want?... - Just an analysis, doctor. - But she's jealous! - What, me? She needs an analyst, not a pediatrist. - A what? - She needs an analyst. Hey, kids! How things are doing? Just fine... Hey, where's my martini? Anyway, I like her. I heard her last exhibition in New York was a smash. Are we gonna wait your pretty boy all night? I don't know what is he doing, he's late. Speak of the devil... And it's not always a real devil. Let me introduce you Erica. You know the others. My husband. - What's so funny? - Nothing. Ludovic has a humour crisis. Don't mind it. - Thanks, it looks delicious. What a day! I'm glad you came and meet us. - And meet you. You wouldn't see anyone if I wasn't pushing you a bit. What about my patients? - Children won't bring you much. - But this, yes? - You know Maurice won't come with us in Paris? - No, why? He found a producer for his Chekhov. A guy from Dakar, I'll tell you about it later. Can you figure that? "The seagull" played by Senegalese actors! - Are you going to Paris? - I forgot to tell you about it. We're leaving on Tuesday to do a film for Air-Inter. Something very big. A contest. I'll tell you about it later. - You could had told me earlier. - Try to be free, doc. Come with us. For once, you'll have some fun. No, thanks. So, kids, where are we going after? Our dear producer is gonna invite us to drink some Champ' at the Top. No... We'll do that some other time. Isn't it, doctor? Attention... Ready? Go! - Goodbye, kids! - Bye. Hey, are you coming? What is it? - A dairy cow as you can see. What else? Awesome... 67 HP, straight-4 engine, four carburettors. You'd be too good-looking on this. And all the pretty mothers of your kiddies are already in love with you. As you said. Come on. Come on, leave it here, you're already all wet. I'll get up early tomorrow, I'll drive you. Come on. Come on! - Hello, Anne. How are you? - Hello. Goodbye, darling. See you on Thursday, for our anniversary. - Goodbye. - Take a good rest. Come on! Too bad, I cooked something good for you. I had to go at the laboratory. Mrs Benson called again. She wanted to see you right away. It's urgent. A long time ago? About 90 minutes. Her voice sounded funny. I'll go. Don't stay too long, I'll reheat it for you. Madame isn't there. - I saw that. - She didn't come down for dinner. She asked not to be disturbed. - She called me. No, don't move. Stay put. Linda, what's wrong? Talk to me. Look at me. Come on, move away! What's wrong with her? What did she take this time? Tell it to me. Is it bad? She's safe, right? Yes, don't worry. Go back to your room. No. I'll stay with her. Leave now. If there's anything, you can call me. If she doesn't feel better, you're not the one I'll call. As you wish. Goodbye, Gaetan. - Are you looking for me? - Yes. You took a big risk. I love taking risks. I have the results of the analysis you asked me. You couldn't know the poisonous level. I know it, now. Why did you call me? You were afraid, after all. Not at all. I wanted you to see me in this splitting state. But you arrived too late. The second phase isn't interesting but I worked during the first one. I went much further than usually. - Do you really think it helps creating? It helps me create, me. You saw the result on the easel. But all the drunkards can't turn into great artists. Too bad, anyway. If you had come earlier... Is your wife on a trip? Yes. - But you're always alone, my dear friend. - I'm used to it. With such a beautiful wife, it's a very bad habit. Don't make too much of it, she'll be back tomorrow night. Do you want to taste the forbidden fruit, doctor? Oh, no, thanks! You're wrong... Our mind is unexplored. It can expand to infinity. Unknown areas of our personality come out. But you prefer to stay on the stand... Okay, let's do it again. Come on, let's get started. Take your positions, everyone. The light is okay. Let's go. Now listen, you shake their hands and say: "Congratulations, you, Mrs, won a house in Villefranche-sur-Mer and you, Mr, 10000 kms of free travel on our lines, etc, etc... Lights! Camera! - Air-Inter 15/18. - Action! Action! "Congratulations, you won..." Congratulations, you won... Congratulations, you won... you, Mrs, my house... and you, Mr, 10000 kms... Congratulations again, etc, etc. Lights, camera and congratulations. Cut. - Ludovic. - What? Chill out. I can't stand it any longer, we must do something. - Jean-Marc. - Yes. Call Bozard and ask him to send someone else. Are you sure you don't want to try? It would be worst, believe me. I can call but we're gonna miss the plane. We'll take it tomorrow morning, I'll treat you to Champagne tonight. In Montmartre. - That's great! Monsieur, what do I do with all this? What do I do with all this? Up to you, put it away somewhere. You can go out if you want, I'm not hungry. - What about my dinner? - It won't be lost. - Then I'll go to see my sister... - You do that. Go see your sister. Jeanette! - You scared me, you idiot! - Where are you going? I go to see my sister. - Doesn't your sister have a moustache? - Yes, and a beard too. Is that bothering you? - Come. I'll show you something. Why's that? Your boss doesn't want it anymore? At last! Put her through! Where? Ask her to call me back. Her husband! Yes, I can hear you. As usual. Why? You want to have sex with me? Because that's what you really want, do you? That's what you really want! Eric, you're drunk. You're drunk because tonight alcohol replaces Anne. Yes, I want to make love to you. But not quite the way you think. We'll enter together into the knowledge. You're not afraid, aren't you? - You didn't touch anything. - No, but I couldn't stop Gaetan. He dashed for her. I managed to take him back to his room. He didn't move since then. Nothing was stolen? You're sure? Sure?... There's nothing to steal here... It's clearly strangulation. There's also marks of blows. - The coroner will confirm it. Okay. Let's see the son. Don't move from here. Are you the one who clean the workshop? - It depends. Sometimes, Mrs Benson didn't want me to touch anything for weeks. So why did you come there this morning? Mrs Benson was an early riser. She used to have a walk around the lake. Especially on sunny days. I was surprised not to see her. - You called us before to tell the son? - Yes. But I called the doctor first. What doctor? The tenant. The Dr Calder, but he wasn't here. - But that was around 8. - Yes. Just before I called the police. She was dead, was did you call the doctor? I don't know, I was a bit confused. The doctor was a friend, he was coming often. - Your boss was ill? - I don't know. She had a bad sleep. You told me the front door was always open? Yes. Mrs Benson hated closed doors. The police is here. - Bye. - Bye, kids! See you later. - Bye, everyone. Let's take a taxi. - I'll prefer if you drive. - Up to you. Wow... My ears are still blocked. We worked nice, you know. There was an actor... I'll tell you later. Anyway, we'll probably have another film to do for Air-Inter this year. Say, I called you yesterday night. Where were you? - At what time? Around 2. We had a small joyriding. I didn't hear, I was probably sleeping. Darling, I'm sorry, please pardon me. I totally forgot and only remember last night. Three years... That's a long time, isn't it? Hey... I hope you're not gonna be sulking all day. Luckily, I'm not jealous, you look really tired. Where are you going? You'll see. Here. Happy anniversary, darling. - You didn't do that!? - I did. We can afford it, you know. And your old bike was rotten. You maybe can... Eric, don't be stupid. Where is your sister living? In Valmont. She's a nurse in a private hospital. - At what time did you came back? - Dunno. Around midnight. Was your boss in bed? - I didn't check if there was light. - Who's all that for? Their wedding anniversary. But Madame was held up in Paris, so they didn't celebrate. They are back. - Mr? - Mrs, Mr... Superintendent Kogan, inspector Prevot. Did you see anyone on the way to the castle? - No, nobody. Not even Kurt. I went directly to the workshop. - The front door was open? - Yes, as always. And where was the son? In his room... There was light in his room, anyway. - And the prescription? - What prescription? You need a prescription for sleeping pills. She still had some left from the previous prescription. - So, you came for nothing? - You know, plenty of people call the doctor for nothing. - You both stayed in the workshop? - Yes. Did she offer you anything? What do you mean? - A drink, a whisky... - A whisky. What did you talk about? - I don't remember exactly... - Come on, Dr, it was yesterday. - I advised her to take less barbiturates. - She was doing drugs, everyone knows that. Precisely, we spoke about the connections between drug and creation. Did she take something yesterday night? No, she was quite lucid. I left around 11. - And once again, you met nobody. Nobody. Thank you, Dr. We'll probably need you again. Don't hold it against us for disturbing for. At your disposal, superintendent. Good morning, Sir. How is he? Not very well. - Can we interrogate him? - Yes, Sir, but I prefer if it's you. What does the coroner's report say? Strangled, around 2 a.m. The autopsy showed she had mushrooms in her stomach. Ingested about three hours before. That is around 11. Didn't Dr Calder tell you about that? No. Nothing was stolen? Apparently, no. But I doubt it is a prowler's crime. We only found the fingerprints of the son, the doctor and the servant. Dr Calder?... What did he tell you? He only said there was light in your room when he came. Light? Why's that? I was sleeping. I was sleeping. Try to remember... You were maybe reading or listening to the radio? Why Dr Calder said that? He hates me... He hates me... He hates me. - Of course, not! He has no reason to hate you. I was sleeping... I was sleeping... I probably just forgot to turn off the light. Sometimes... it was on all night. And Kurt? Was he getting along with your mother? Yes... They weren't speaking a lot to each other. And the doctor? Why don't you also suspect him? I'm sure it's him! Sure! I'm sure it's him! What make you claim something like this? He was the last one to come. After him, no one came. This has to be proved, Mr Benson. As your were sleeping, you can't help us. No... I was sleeping. I was sleeping. I shouldn't had slept. If I weren't sleeping, I could have defend her. You could had told us earlier that you're one of our client. What, client? I've never been in trouble in Switzerland. What happen in France was different. - You think so? You still have a nice record. Aggravated assault, thievery... Ten years of prohibition on residence for burglary. And that should leave us indifferent as if you were chief Boy Scout. I'm clean since I got discharged in 1959. I behave well. - Just like this? After a few talks with the prison's chaplain? Sure, why not? - And since then, you go to bed at 10? - I've always been an early-riser. And that night, you just fall asleep like a brute? "Like a brute" if it makes you happy! - And you didn't hear anything? - No. And I've nothing to reproach myself. Mrs Benson has always been very good to me. She gave me that job. She had no prejudices. - She maybe was wrong. - It's not me, for Christ's sake! That's too easy! It doesn't have to be me because I've done stupid things when I was young. It's unfair. - Chill out, I'm not accusing you. I'm looking for the truth. I guess you don't mind if I do. The motive? How would I know? Eric doesn't know much than the police. He's just back, I'm leaving you. Reserve the screening at 10. Okay, see you later. So? So I signed my statement, no more. Can't you put away all that stuff? - Leave it! I can't understand why somebody killed her. If only I knew. - Dinner is served. - Thank you. Aren't you hungry? Come on, have a seat. Chill out. I'm calm. Why wouldn't I be calm? You're upset because of all this, it's normal. It's silly it came upon you. - Upon me? You're the last one who saw her alive. She was fancying you a lot. I guess you didn't tell it to the police. - But it's not important! - Maybe, for them... - Because for you, it is? I'm very surprised. She was always calling when you weren't home, which was quite often. Please, Eric, not again. I never cared much for anniversary dates. You know how absent-minded I am. Precisely, I feel I don't really know you. Or very bad. Sometimes, I wonder why you're still with me. Just because I love you. What a strange way to love me: you're never home. Just like my mother, always running. - I'm working! - So it's because of your work? I mean what you call your work. Your career. What you care about the most. You're pretty much like Mrs Benson. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. - What a face you give me. - Get off my back! I'm fed up of all your questions. I'm fed up, can you understand that!? Excuse-me, Monsieur, do you want the apple pie with Chantilly cream? Some cream on top... You know? Darling... Excuse-me, I was upset before. No, it's my fault. But you were so harsh... You never spoke to me like this. I have to go at the screening. I'm late. See you later. You can't understand. I don't understand myself. I'm turning crazy. Anne... Hello, Jeanette. - Hello, Madame. - Is the doctor already gone? - Yes, he left a while ago. - To the hospital? He didn't say. He just drunk a coffee and left. How was he? Like usually. It's enough, thanks. - Madame... - Yeah? I'm summoned by the police this afternoon. - What they want this time? - I don't know. Try to come back for the dinner. Can you give me the butter, please? Thanks. Madame... What's wrong? Listen, I... I'm listening. I lied to the police. I didn't go to see Aline. The police probably noticed it when they went at the private hospital and that's why they want to see me. I'm sure of it. - Where were you, then? Don't be afraid to speak, Jeannette! I saw my boyfriend in Geneva. Why didn't you say it before? Everyone can have a boyfriend! It's not a boy, he's old and married. His wife isn't home now. I can't give his name... I don't want to put him into troubles. - There's no other way. But don't worry, they won't say anything to his wife. You really think so? But then... at what time did you came back? Jeanette! About 5 on the morning. Don't be mad at me. I was so afraid to wake up Monsieur, I didn't make any noise. There was light in the bathroom. Maybe Monsieur wasn't asleep. Well. Here's Dr Ardoin's report. "This mushroom, without being poisonous, contains micro atropine and muscarine. Two hallucinogenic substances. We can state that Mrs Benson was under the hold of this mushroom at the time of the crime." And yet... That's where it becomes interesting. Dr Calder asked Dr Ardoin a few days earlier to have this very same mushroom analysed. Read by yourself. This plus the maid's lies... We have to summon Dr Calder. There's no hurry. Anyway... I prefer if it's judge Forman who interrogates him. We still have to keep an eye on him. I'll handle this. - What does say Paris's report? - Nothing very interesting. A serious student. Father died during the war in 1940. He once ran away at 12. But was back in school two days later. Since then... Nothing bad about him. Who's there? Who's there? What is it? Nothing... There was somebody outside. - Who? I don't know. It doesn't fit. What? What you said about the police. Why would they hang around the house? - Why not? - Yes, but why? What would they do hidden behind the trees? I first thought Jeanette wasn't here. You can't imagine how terrible it is to come back alone in an empty house. What happened? - Did you take your pill? - What pill? Yes, why? Did you hurt yourself? I have something to tell you. About Jeanette. The police summoned her again this afternoon. Yeah, they hassle everybody. It's silly but... the first time she said she was with her sister, the night Benson died. She wasn't with her? No. She was in Geneva. She has a lover, there. A married guy. His wife is a night worker. - So? She came back at 5 on the morning. She said you weren't in bed. She told them that? Probably. She's crazy. Where does she pretend she saw me? She doesn't pretend she saw you. She says there was light in the bathroom. Do you worry about the electricity bill? It can be serious. The police can figure anything. - Let them figure what they want. At 5... Were you up? It's possible. I don't check the time when I go take a leak. You didn't go out? Are you suspecting me too? Of course not! Put out your cigarette. I already told you not to smoke in bed. Eric... what's wrong? Nothing. I can't sleep because of the storm. Come to bed, you'll catch a cold. It reminds me the bombardments in Brest. When we were going down to the cellar. You can't figure how it was. - I can a little. I was 6. I was alone. Turn it off. Turn it off! It's for you. What is it? - A summoning from the cops. - What are you gonna do? - Go see them. What else could I do? YOUR HUSBAND IS A MURDERER "I possibly got up around 5 a.m. on the 14th of august to answer the call of nature." To the question "Why, during your previous statement, didn't you speak about a certain mushroom that the victim willingly ingested with a precise purpose?", answered: "I didn't consider it useful to reveal this detail. Therefore, I thought to be under the professional secrecy." Is it correct? Yes. When it comes to murder, Dr... Professional secrecy... Whatever. We're done. You can sign. I'm sorry to bother you with all those questionings. Professional necessity. - It's all right, Judge. Do you think you'll come to an end soon? - You know as much as I do. - Goodbye, Judge. - Goodbye. You're not planning a trip? - What does it mean? Nothing, Dr, but you don't only have friends in this city. - I don't understand. - Malicious gossips, anonymous letters... It's despicable, but I have to reckon with it, against my wishes. - You received anonymous letters? - We always do in this type of case. Everyone is suspect. Don't take offence of it. A woman is waiting with her little boy. She didn't say her name but I told her to... - It's fine, thank you. I came without an appointment, if it's a problem... It's all right, come in. This way. Mrs...? - I better tell you now, I'm not the mother. It's just because he's ill. - What's wrong with him? You know, I live in one of the buildings behind the station. - The parents' name? - It's written "Mrs Vallin" on the door but I never heard of a Mr Vallin. You know what I mean? If you have children, you must take care of them. She's never home. But you can't say she's working. Never home? It's the same thing almost every day. A car come. She put the TV on. And the kid stays on his own. So this morning, I hear the TV, but louder than usually. I'm a night-worker, you know. So I dress up and come up. That was too much. I have rights too. And what do I find? The door open... the mother gone, of course, and the kid all alone. You can't figure how he was crying. He was burning. So I gave him an aspirin. If you have children, you don't let them all alone. That's true, you can't do that. Mum! Good! Pretty good! You prefer like this? It's not that bad. Good work, guys! What do you think, Anne? Yeah, yeah... You don't look good, what's wrong? Excuse-me, children, I have a busy mind right now. Let's get back to it. - From the start. - Of course. You know, newspapers are full of shit... You don't know how much this story bother him. Sometimes, he totally flip out. - What can you do about it? He needs me. Maybe more than I thought. Come on, he lost his baby teeth already! Don't think about it. - Why? Can't I drink? - I didn't say anything. You've seen all your patients? - Yeah. I don't know if you noticed it, but there isn't a lot of people right now. And you? You're home early, are you feeling sick? I was done, that's all. What kind of bullshit they say in town? - Read by yourself. - No, I don't give a shit. Up to you. As you can see, there's nothing else but plain water, here. What are you doing? Get onboard. - The night is falling. - It's gonna be more romantic. Come on, get onboard, I said! They'll maybe arrest me. What if I'm guilty? - Why do you say that? It's just a supposition. That's my right, isn't it? It's not funny. Yet, I'm the last one who saw her. Who could came in the workshop after me? Any idea? - I don't know... The servant, the son... Or the Holy Spirit! Judge Forman isn't convince like you I'm innocent. It's normal. He doesn't know you. Because you know me? You claim to know me! You have no idea of what I can do. You can't know it. As a child, I wanted to kill my mother. I never told you that. You're afraid, isn't it? - Eric! Say it! Say you're afraid of me! What are you doing? See how easy it is? After, you feel free... There's just the cops and the routine... Get down, for Christ's sake! Do you see there was someone the other night? So? - He's sleeping in his room. - Come with me. Inspector! Come here! Jesus, you shouldn't touch it! With this rain, anyway... Do you saw it already? - No. No! I told you I was in the cellar fixing the boiler. It's easy, you just have to check. You could had fix it in the afternoon. Of course. You can always find the answer. Why would I do that? I've nothing against this doctor. And let me tell you something. If I had wanted to shoot him, you have my word, I wouldn't had miss him. Five in Indochina in the paratroopers. It's in my record, you can check. I was a marksman. You aged since then. You lost your touch. You're right, I'm short-sighted and have shaky hands. But there's something sure: my door was open. You told us that already. Someone came to get your gun. You should be careful of thieves. You know the job. Since, 59, I didn't even steal a pin. I believe you for the pin but not for the rest. - What do you mean? - From time to time, you sold drawings signed Linda Benson in Geneva. You can't deny it. We have proves. I don't deny! It was just some sketches she gave me. Gave? You two really got along! - I always told you so. But you hide us something else. Okay, I get the picture. Yeah, I slept with her. I fucked her. I shagged her all right with my dirty ruffian's face! You cops can't say the same. And what does it prove anyway? - You maybe were jealous. - Jealous? Of whom? Dr Calder. - Hello, inspector. - Hello, doctor. You finished your statement? - Yeah. By the way... Do you really think it's Kurt? It's more than likely. Everything is against him. But it's hard to get a confession with this kind of crook. Yes, of course. You can rest easy, tomorrow everything will be back to normal. Stop it, I said! What's that? Are you out of your mind? What's with you? Get off my back! IMMINENT ARREST OF LINDA BENSON'S MURDERER A former paratrooper. That's what come out of them. I'm off. Are you coming? Come on. Let's have a drink. You didn't go to the hospital? Betty. What? It's like with Betty. I was 3 when my mother bought it to me. She was pretty. That was the kind of doll they were making at the time. Every kid had... - Eric, slow down. I couldn't take her outside. When I was alone, I was caressing her. Like you. You understand? Like my mother. You have the same eyes she had. And you're leaving me alone, like her. Eric, please stop, you're drunk again. Once, I went back upstairs after a... after a bombardment. I had left Betty in her box. My mother came back, she wasn't dead neither... What are you saying? So I took her by the feet and I banged her head against the wall. With all my strength! With all my strength, and I felt better. You understand? You understand? - There's nothing to understand. - There is. It's me. It's me who killed her. Now, I found the reason. The motive. And those dummies are thinking it's Kurt. But it's Kurt. He fired at you. It's not Kurt, it's Gaetan. Only him can know I strangled his mother. Now, I know why. Yes, I know why. The 13th of august. I went back home... I waited for you to celebrate our anniversary. Jeanette told me you won't come back but I'm so dumb I didn't believed her so I drank. She called me around 11. She was not feeling like sleeping. She wanted me to try the mushroom with her. It's all your fault. All your fault! Yes! After... I don't remember. I don't know. Everything was turning around me. I saw people I thought I know... My mother, Gaetan... and you. I saw you with your boots. When I woke up, she was dead. I killed Linda Benson instead of you. You're the one I wanted to kill. You! Yes, you! Get off. Get off. Come on, get off! - Eric, please! Get off quickly! - Eric, where are you going? - To the cops. You're crazy! Eric, stop, I beg of you! Mrs Calder. I heard the car stop. Is your husband gone? Can I help you? Come to the house. I'll lend you some slippers. Come. Have a seat, Mrs Calder. Do you want something? A bit of brandy? I don't like alcohol. I don't smoke either. I never go out. I'm all alone now they arrested Kurt. I only had her, you know. She never let me go to school. Let their Cartesian spirit corrupt me. She taught me everything. She was right, isn't she? I have all this left. The jackals came to buy them. How could I sold them? That's everything I have left. This is the place she's been took away from me. Here. My poor Linda... Tell me it's not true. Listen, Gaetan... you should not hold it against him. He's not responsible. He didn't know what he was doing. He wasn't himself. It's an accident. A terrible accident. But I can't believe it. Who? It's not Kurt? So it's him. He told you he did it? He's confessed? Yes. I was sure of it. I tried to put the blame on me, huh? He's gonna make up stories to get through it. No, he'll tell the truth. He went to give himself up to the police. To the police. Then it's over, they won't come to hassle me anymore. - I guess they'll need you again. - No. They can't question me more, I can't stand it anymore. And I don't care, he killed Linda. He finished her off. I knew it. I'll tell them. I saw him leaving on the morning, from my window. You saw him leaving? You never told that to the police. To the police... you said you were sleeping. - I said nothing! I mean, I didn't say that. I don't remember, I was distressed. Leave me alone, I've always said it was him. To the judge... you said you were sleeping at 11. - Leave me alone, I don't know. Come on... You just told me you recognised him from your window on the morning. I didn't say that. You're making it up. You're making it up! He killed Linda. I tried to stop her to eat those bloody mushrooms. When was that? How did you know? - She told me. She told me. She didn't trust him. He was slowly poisoning her. He was always here. Why was he always here? To have sex with her. It's not true! It's not true. She couldn't do that to me. She had no right. Yes, she had! Your mum was very pretty. My husband was cheating on me with her. That kind of things happen. - No. No. It's not true! Liar! She undressed before him. It was probably here. And you... you were in the corridor. Listening at them. She had no right. She had no right to do that to me! They took the mushroom together... My husband fainted. You came in... And you killed your mother. It's you, isn't it? It's not true. It's not true. It's not true. You couldn't stand to see your mother with a younger man. Isn't it? That's what happened. I didn't mean to kill her. I didn't mean to kill her. I didn't mean to kill her! They were here. Lying down together. He... He was asleep. She recognised me. She still had her mind. Why did she do that? Why did she do that? She was laughing. She was laughing at me. She had no right. She had no right to do that to me! She had no right! I'd like to speak to superintendent Kogan, please. It's urgent. It's Mrs Calder speaking. Is my husband here? Superintendent, it's Mrs Calfer speaking. I'm at the Benson house. Come quickly, I know everything. It's Gaetan Benson who killed his mother. He's confessed everything. No, I locked him up. Come quickly, please. Superintendent. Inspector... - What are you doing here? I have something very important to tell you. You'll do that later. Follow us quickly. Your wife is in danger. Come quickly! You didn't kill her. He's confessed everything. Gaetan? Yes. It's not you. It's not you. It's not you. Doctor, come quickly, he's alive. Translation and timing: Aquasantajoe
