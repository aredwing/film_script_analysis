Gigi, the genie of the lantern, was racing to stop her shadow sister, Whisp, from doing a great evil. Hurry, Fawn! We have to get you to the mirror room before she finds you. Gigi, my sister. She's found us! Hurry! You have something of mine. Whisp, leave Fawn alone! Uh, hello? Who are you talking to? Quickly, in here! The Finder of the lantern has one wish left. And she will wish the shadow genie all powerful! Wish the shadow genie all powerful. Wait, why did I just think of that? You must resist. The wish is yours to make. Whisp's influence over you has grown too strong. Grimm's magic mirror will show you who you really are. Too late, sister, her thoughts are mine and so is her wish. Grant all power to the shadow genie. Fawn, do not be influenced. The eclipse makes me real! And then the wish will make it last forever. No! Quickly! Wish all power to the shadow genie. I wish all... No! No! Whoa. No! All the power! The eclipse is over, the danger's passed! Wish for something, anything! I wish all this would go away! No! As you wish! Ahh! Ahh! No! Goodbye. Huh? Is it too late to wish for money? I should have kept the magic carpet. Aw! And so, the lantern was lost in the sands of time. First day of school at Monster High. Fresh blood! New victims! Whoa! Ow! Hey, ghouls, killer back-to-school outfits. Look good, feel good. I heard that. You ghouls ready to rock this fang? The first day of school. The most electrifying time in a young monster's life! New year, new possibilities. Anything can happen. I say, don't fear the year. Smile for the Ghostly Gossip! Jolly good! And there's as many different wishes for a new school year as there are students. Some wishes are pretty simple. Wait up, I'm thirsty. Jackson, I think that water fountain's still... Broken. Everything broken here. Wish I was in charge, then things would run like work-clock. Ooh! Ooh! Abbey! You could run against Slow-Moe for Student Disembodied President. Oh! And some wishes are way complicated. Oh, Gil, this year is gonna be the best ever! We're gonna dominate the swimming events, be absolute monsters on the scream-track. Ahem, Gil? What's the matter? I'm sorry, Lagoona, I can't come over to your house for dinner tonight. Or any other night... Crikey! Again? Just because I'm a saltwater monster? I wish your parents would accept me. Yeah, me, too. Hey, Twyla! I gotta tell you, Howleen, I love your new look this year. Thanks, Twyla! Hey, watch where you're going! What are you even doing in this hall, anyway? I didn't... Geek Hall is over there. Talk about fur-gettable. Don't listen to her, Howleen. She doesn't know what she's talking about. Yes, she does, Twyla. We're outcasts. I mean, hello! Your father's the Boogie Man. I wish I was popular. Some wishes are all about change, some wishes are all about keeping things the way they are. How 'bout you, Cleo? Um, how about nothing? You don't want anything to be different this year? Why would I? My life is perfect. I've got it all, popularity, great friends... We are the power couple... Oh, hey, Cleo! And, of course, looks, brains and talent. I wish everything stays exactly the same. Some wishes are about paying it forward. Yeah, I would've been lost if I hadn't met you guys. I wish I could help someone like you ghouls helped me last year. - Hey, check it out. - And some wishes? Well, they're just plain batty. Heath, you think this stunt is gonna be unbelievable enough to get us on the show? You know it, Manny. Die Trying! Is gonna have to put us on when they see this video. Ready, Clawd? Three, two, one, blast off! Ahh! Aw, yeah! Yeah! Let's check out the footage! Ah! Do it again? Everybody has something they wish for. And some monsters will do anything to make those wishes come true. I'd like to go on record saying this is a bad idea. Noted. You don't need to do this to get everyone's attention. Um, hanging in the shadows has messed with your vision, Twyla. Nobody knows who I am. Uh, sure, they do. Yeah, they know me as Clawd and Clawdeen's annoying little sister. Nobody knows me for me. That's all gonna change after I pull this off. I'm gonna be big time! And that's what you want? Who doesn't? Me. Well, you, my testy bestie, are a better monster than me. Now, please, will you help me? I'll see you in class. And for what it's worth, you don't need to be popular, Howleen. The monsters that matter already know how awesome you are. Really? The first occultation in a thousand years? Cool. What's an occultation? An eclipse. This week? Directly above Monster High? Awesome astrology stuff. Fine. Awesome astronomy stuff, whatevs. Whoa. Somebody's asking for a jolt to the bolts! Way too much power for one outlet. Come on! But what nobody could know was that the time to make your screams come true had finally arrived! It's my sister! We gotta stop her! My name in lights! Everybody's gonna know me now! Howleen! Stop! No! Wait! What is all this commotion? Omph! Really, Howleen Wolf, on the first day of school? Worst punishment ever. I can't believe Bloodgood is making us clean out this dusty old attic. Thanks a lot, Howleen. How many more times do I gotta say I'm sorry? I'll let you know when you get there. Hey, it's not so bad, it's kinda cool up here. So much interesting old stuff. They're trying to let you off the hook. I just don't get what your whole fang-up is with being popular. That's because you're popular, Clawdeen! Ugh! You just don't get it. Ooh! "I just don't get what your whole "fang-up is with being popular. " Someday I'm gonna run this school, and then they'll all be sorry. Whoa. Ah! Greetings, Finder. The who-what-what-er? You have found me. How may I serve you? So, wait. You're a genie? Correct. I am Gigi. And I am here to serve the Finder. And you, like, grant wishes and stuff? The Finder is granted 13 wishes to use as she chooses. And I can wish for anything? No way. Great! Make a wish, Howleen! Oh, wow. Okay, um... It's a lot of pressure. I, um... Just think of something you really want. Well, I really wish we weren't in detention anymore. As you wish. Perfect! An eclipse in three days! When the moon covers the sun, the shadows will rule all! Amazing. Hey, where did you ghouls come from? Never mind that, let's go shopping! I am at your command. Summon me, I will appear. You have 12 wishes left. Wow, is this like the best thing to happen to anybody, ever? I must warn you, there is a dark side to the wishes. The temptation to use them selfishly is powerful. Be cautious, choose wisely. Oh, my ghoul, what am I gonna wish for next? There are so many things that I want. New clothes, new shoes, maybe a new car, although, I can't even drive yet! Uh, hey. You heard her, you gotta be careful. Think things over, be smart about this. It's my genie, not yours. And you can't tell me how to use my wishes! Uh, I'm not telling you... yes, you are! You're always telling me what to do. Howleen! Ah, sisters. You know what, I am so glad you decided to run for Student Disembodied President! This seem unnecessary. I am running for president, not prom queen. I focus on issues. Silly ghoul. Politics is about perception. If you look good, people listen. Draculaura, I don't know. Trust me. Everyone here is so nice and friendly. Yeah, it's totes awesome. You're gonna enjoy it here. Yeah, I think I will. Howleen was way pumped about having all these wishes. And even though she'd never admit it to her big sister... Whoa! She was taking her advice and giving this some real thought. So now we can't even be in the same classes together? My parents don't want us spending any time together. I thought we were so past this! I'm sorry, Lagoona. I think I could help. You're sweet. But it's Gil's parents, they'll never let us be together. Freshwater monsters have been looking down their gills at us saltwater folk for centuries. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do about that. You might be surprised about what I could do. Gigi, I need you. I wish Gil's parents liked Lagoona! As you wish. Whoa! I've turned freshwater! I can't believe it! Gil's parents are gonna flip their fins when they see me! Thank you, Howleen! I so rock! That felt fur-rific. High five, Gigi! Howleen was looking for someone else to help. And the answer fell right at her feet. Aw, dudes, we got it! Ah! Epic! Aw, man, it's hopeless. We're never gonna get on Die Trying! Don't worry, big bro, I gotcha. I wish you were all on your favorite show. As you wish. Crash Maxxon coming to you live from... Where am I? Right. Monster High! Let's meet our new contestants! Clawd Wolf. Manny Taur. Burns, Heath Burns. Are you ready to be on this show where the stunts are so epic, so colossally insane, that you either finish them or... Die Trying! Oh, yeah! Thanks, little sis. You rock! On to the first stunt! Vote for Abbey, won't be sorry. A vote for Abbey is vote for change. Please to vote for Abbey. Hey, what you got to lose? Early polling numbers are in! Yeesh. Oh, boy. Campaign not going so hot? She's in last place. Am losing to Headmistress Bloodgood's horse, Nightmare, and she not even running. What you need is a celebrity endorsement. Great idea! That will really boost us in the polls. But who? Oh! The Himalayan sensation, Anton yaklovitch? Huh? No, me! Everyone in this school worships me. If I endorse you, you're sure to win! That might work. Or you could let me help you. I have a magic genie. All I have to do is say the word, and it's President Abbey. Great! Howleen, do your fang. I wish Abbey was Student Disembodied President. As you choose. How about a hand for our new president, Abbey! Howleen, thank you. You have an amazing power. Hmm. Abbey! Abbey! Abbey! If it isn't the lunar loser. You don't belong in this ghouls' room. You don't belong anywhere. She's right, you know? You don't belong anywhere. I don't belong anywhere. You know, Gigi could make you popular. Duh! I have a genie! She can make me the most popular monster at school! Summon her. Gigi, I need you! Whisp? Please leave her alone! Who are you talking to? Why? So you can let her waste all her wishes? Finder, I warn you. Don't be tempted to use the wishes for selfish... you know the rules. The Finder chooses the wish. Howleen, it's your wish. It's my wish! Don't you want to be popular? My wish is to be popular. But... Just do it! As you choose. Did it work? Go on, find out. This one is weak and easy to prompt. No. Howleen has a good heart. You wouldn't corrupt her like the others because she has friends! Her friends can't help her if her friends aren't around. Hey, Howleen! You look really pretty today! Hey, ghoul. I was wondering if you'd come to my party this weekend. You're so cool, if you come, I just know everybody else will show up! Wow, really? Um, sure! Thanks! Smashing outfit! A winner! I'm telling you, Twyla, anything you want, just ask me, and bam, it's yours! You gotta want something. Hmm, nope, I'm good. Hm, really? Howleen, you're as fresh as spring! Such an organic look! Going to the Coffin Bean after school, if you wanna fang out. Sure, sounds great! Gory? Really? I know, crazy, right? Even she's nice to me now. Come on, Twyla! I can make you popular, too! No, no, thanks. You know me. I'm comfortable being in the shadows. Fine, whatevs. How dclass. I'm guessing you used the genie to make yourself popular. You know, back in my day, you had to earn your popularity by being born into the right family! I love being a genie, but in my lantern, it gets so lonely. You can't have any friends in a lantern? I had one, once. But she and I, well, we drifted apart. Oh! I get that! But I always pull it together. Monster High is so wonderful. But... But what? I can't stay. I serve the Finder, after her last wish, I go back to the lantern. But why? I live by rules, Frankie. It has always been that way. Changing the way things have always been is my specialty. Well, of course Howleen's changed. Being popular is not easy. Not everyone can handle it with the grace and humility of moi. Yeah, maybe she thinks humility means something else! Guess what! Gil's parents invited me over for dinner last night, it was so much fun! And they, well, they loved her! I'm going back tonight, his mom is going to show me how to make his fave lily pad linguine! She loves me! Whoa! Okay. We'll talk to you ghouls later. Yeah, this is not our Lagoona. How's my Cleo, queen of my heart? Hey, Deuce, have you talked to my brother and the guys? Nah, they're still on the show. Man, I bet they're having the time of their lives. Man, I thought the last stunt was rough. Maybe it's not as bad as it looks. That's right! Our contestants must zip line 400 feet down into a pit of venomous vipers. But that's not all! They'll have to slide through the rings of fire! And all of this while being chased by a hungry dragon! Oh! Are you boys ready to finish this stunt or... Die Trying! Now, Abbey, as Student Disembodied President, it is your responsibility to manage the day-to-day functioning of Monster High in the absence of the headmistress. You're going away? Yes, unfortunately, I have to attend an emergency meeting. I have left all the details and instructions in that guidebook. Headmistress Bloodgood, time to go. Yes, very well. I have every confidence that, in your hands, Abbey, this school will be in exactly the same condition as when I left it. Perfect. I will be back in a few days. Now, your first act as president. Morning announcements! Attention, this is President Abbey. Lunch hour now is 20 minutes. To give more time for the studies. Is for their own good. Ah! Twyla. Sorry, I do that, it's a family thing. Hey, what's the matter? You know, it's just Howleen. She's different now. Popular. This happens to some Finders. They get what they thought they wanted, and it changes them. Yeah, but that's not it. It's hard to explain. There is something different in the shadows. Like someone or something is living there. Do you know anything about this? I cannot say. Gigi... I really cannot. The magic of the lamp stops me from telling the Finder all that I know. Please, Gigi, you gotta help Howleen out. You need to guide her. Howleen must choose her path. I am not allowed to influence her. But others can. Well, if you can't help her, maybe we can. Come on, Twyla. Wait. Guys, guys, I can't hear you. What? Front row of the casketball game on Friday? Let me check. Okay, well, I'll have to move some things around, but I think I can make it. What? Gory is having a party next Saturday? Aw, man, that's the same day as Operetta's party. I guess I can't make it. Wait! Why am I moving stuff? I'm the popular one! Operetta will just have to move her party if she wants me to fit her into my skedge... Howleen! We have to talk. Yeah. This isn't you. Whatever's going down, we're here for you. Where were they when you were getting picked on in the bathroom? That's right! Where were you? Huh? Hey, this is what popular looks like. If you can't handle that... Being popular's not as easy as I make it look, is it? Go away, Cleo. You're just not built to handle popularity. You have no idea what it's like being an outcast! What it's like being forgotten, being nobody. Perhaps she should learn what it's like. Totally. Gigi, I need you! Yes, Finder, how may I serve you? I wish Cleo knew what it was like to be nobody. But, but, Finder... Now! As you choose. Hmm. No amount of wishing can turn me into a nobody! You won't believe what just... Oh, hey. Are you new here? New here? No, it's me! Hi, Me, I'm Draculaura, and this is Frankie. It's a big school. Are you lost? Hah, you're joking. You're not! The wish! Nobody knows me! That new girl seems kinda high-strung. Totes. Ugh. Hey, you okay? Don't think I've seen you around here before. No! Dude. Hey! Yo, dudes, would you think that I was a wimp if I, uh, didn't want to go back on the show anymore? It's like we're living a nightmare! We just gotta tell Crash that we're dunzo, - he'll understand. - Ah! Are you ready for the next terrifyingly awesome stunt? Yeah, about that. We don't think we can do the show anymore. Oh, that's a funny joke. You can't quit this show. What? You get to the finale, or you... Die Trying! Our next stupefying stunt? Locked in a janitor's closet filled with angry dung beetles! Mommy! Students, you are in such luck for lunch! Himalayan yak surprise! Lagoona, what are you doing? Aren't you going to eat? Sure, just not until I finish cutting his food like his mom showed me. A freshwater tradition, which I embrace. This is embarrassing. Yo. New girl! Cleo. Twyla. High school can be pretty rough if you don't know anyone. Tell me about it. So, what's your story, new girl? I'm not the new girl! I haven't seen you before. Ugh! I am the most popular ghoul at this school. Yeah, right. Okay. I mean, let's just say I believed any of that. What's everybody's deal with being popular? Why can't monsters just be happy with who they are? I see what you're doing. You do? You're using reverse psychology on me! Actually, am not... you're telling me to take back what I've lost! Not even close. To get back my status, my popularity, my boyfriend, Deuce! I'm a de Nile! And I'm not going to let a teeny setback keep me from my destiny! Oh, you're a genius, girl whose name I can't remember! Hey, Twyla, who was the new girl? I see my sister's still forgetting who her real friends are. I don't think it's her fault. Something's going on. But I can't figure out what. Maybe I can. Howleen, we need to talk. Oh, no can do. Hey! What's your damage? What's my damage? You're the one who's shutting out everybody who cares about you. She just can't stand it! Big, bad Clawdeen Wolf, jealous of her little sis. You're just jealous of me. Jealous? Everybody's right about these wishes, they've changed you. A real big sister would be happy for you. Why can't you just be happy for me? Because that's what big sisters do! They call you on it when you mess up. And Howleen, I love you, but you are messing up major. Come on, let's go find that genie, we gotta undo these wishes. I got this. Gigi, I need you. Oh, Gigi, thank goodness you're here. Howleen and I think it would be a good idea... She is standing in my... your way. Just take the lantern away. Maybe it's time you made her disappear. Maybe... I just don't think Howleen is mature enough to handle it. I wish... I wish my sister would just disappear! What? Do it! Do it! As you choose. Whoa! Whoa! Fang-tastic outfit. Bad situation. Howleen! Oh! I'm telling you, Howleen is different. And now Clawdeen is really, really different! Gigi, you okay? What's wrong? Does it have something to do with Howleen and Clawdeen? I want to tell you, I really do, but I'm afraid I might do more harm. Gigi, our friends are in trouble, we've got to help them. As I told you, there is a temptation to the wishes, a darkness... A shadow. Yes. Twyla said there was something weird going on in the shadows. I thought it was something to do with the upcoming eclipse... An eclipse? When? Totally, and it's going to be directly over Monster High. This is terrible news. Why? I can't directly interfere with any decisions made by the Finder. Ghoulia's right, we're not the Finder. You should be able to tell us, right? Yes. Okay. But we must be careful not to let others overhear. Come with me. This is your shadow who's doing all of this? Yes. I am restricted by the rules of the lantern, but Whisp is not. Whisp turns the Finders against their better natures. She is whispering things to Howleen and I'm unable to stop her. And what about Clawdeen? That is not Clawdeen. That is a shadow version. If that's not Clawdeen, then where is Clawdeen? She has been banished. She's been what? Wait, wait, wait. Banished? Where? To my home, the lantern. Then we're going there to get her back! It will do no good. Even if you got Clawdeen out, there is a much bigger problem. During the eclipse, Monster High will be cast into a shadowy twilight. And in that semi-darkness, shadows gain depth and power. When the eclipse is total, Whisp will become real, and if she can convince the Finder to wish, "All power to the shadow genie," she will gain all the powers of a dark shadow genie permanently and will banish everyone at Monster High into the lantern. They will be replaced with shadow versions. Whisp will be their leader, and every one of us, including Howleen, will be trapped in the lantern for all eternity. What can we do to stop Whisp? There's no way to stop her now. Ghoulia's right. Clawdeen can stop Howleen from making that wish! But inside the lantern is a strange and dangerous land that Whisp controls. It is not safe. And it won't be easy to find Clawdeen. We must get her out. While I cannot get you inside, I can help you get back out. This orb can be used once and only once to transport you all back out of the lantern. So, how can we get Whisp to send us into the lantern? Well, she is eliminating all obstacles in her path to ultimate power. So we just have to become an obstacle. Die Trying! Die Trying! Die Trying! This is humiliating. And I'm claustrophobic! Hey, shh! They're gonna find us! Not that I'm scared or anything. Me neither! Bring it on! Ah! Hey! Is President Abbey. Am now to announce class trip for whole school to ocean! For whole week of beach clean-up! Yes! Great way to build community and help environment. That is all. Mother Nature would approve. I approve. Count me out, I'm spending the week with you, Gil! Every day, all day. I mean, who cares about a bunch of polluted sea water? Blech! No appointment? You don't see my sister, got it? Let's do this! Oh, my ghoul! So sorry, new girl! Here, let me... I got it, Frankie. See you later! Hey, uh, I'm Deuce. Call me crazy, but do I know you from somewhere? Oh, thank Ra! Finally... I got it! You have an older sister who used to go here, right? Ugh! Nefera... Well, maybe I'll see you around. Cleo. See you around, Cleo. And I hope so. Oof! Clawd? Hey, bro. What's up? Um, why are you in the trash can? Just where I hang. Since when? Since, I don't know, like always! Everyone's doing this now. Oh, sure. All day! Huh? Oh, yeah! Ready for the next round! As always, what's mine is yours, little sister. Howleen, we need to talk. Now. Sorry, she's kind of busy, okay, ghouls? Cut the act, you're not the real Clawdeen. If you'll excuse me. Howleen, these wishes have gotten way out of hand. Give us back our friend or we tell Bloodgood and get you kicked out of school! They challenge your power! Get rid of them. Gigi, I need you! You summoned me? So, they want to know where their bestie is? Hah. Show them! Gigi, for my next wish... Oh, my ghoul. Are you done? Fine. That was wish number eight. Whoa! We did it! We're inside the lantern! Which explains why we look so... Mmm, fabulous! Wow, this place is beautiful and big. How are we ever going to find Clawdeen? Clawdeen's size sevens. Hello? Clawdeen? Now you are in my playground. It's Whisp! In the flesh. Um, sort of. You see, out here, I am merely an unnoticed shadow. But inside the lantern, I am all powerful! And soon, everything you have will be mine. Look! It's our shadows! Wanna save your friend? Good luck! The shadow eclipse is coming, your time is running out! All right, class, you gotta be very, very careful with... Ah, ah... Not again. Read chapter 13 until I get back! I just figured out the perfect way for us to get back to the top of the social scene. Cleo, I was never on top of the social scene. Well, now you can be! All we have to do is throw a royally epic party here at school and everyone will love us forever! And maybe Deuce will ask you to go with him? Oh, do you think so? I mean, if he does, cool, whatevs. But come on, this is your chance to step out of the shadows and into the limelight. Just don't upstage me. I won't. Seriously, I won't. Great! Now, when should we do it? Oh! This looks good! The night of the shadow eclipse? Hey, there, Madam Prez! Got a minute? I have some great ideas on how to change the school. Of course! Anything for you! Truth be told, need the extra help. No. And now you're going after Abbey? I'm simply clearing the way. With each wish, I get stronger. When the moon crosses the sun, I will have everything. You will have nothing. Stings, doesn't it, sister? Watch out! Whoa, this is like the coolest library I've ever been in! Clawdeen! Ghouls! Oh, no! Did Howleen send you here, too? It's not her fault. Whisp, I knew it! Gigi gave us this orb to get us back out. Come on. We have to get you back to Monster High. We need you to talk to Howleen. Make sure that she doesn't listen to Whisp! I don't know. Howleen never listened to me much before. There might be another way. There's something you ghouls need to see. I was digging around and found this! It's a genie-ology. Written by the Brothers Grimm. "Once upon a time in a strange and distant land... " - Mystery and magic ruled. - It was the age of the genie. Gigi loved being a genie, granting wishes to her Finders, making their dreams come true. But something was missing. When the 13 wishes were granted, she returned to her lantern, alone. Gigi was lonely. One of the Brothers Grimm wanted to help. He whispered an idea into the ear of the next Finder, who then made a wish for Gigi. It was during a full eclipse that the magic of the wish transformed Gigi's shadow into Whisp. Always together, they were like sisters. But Whisp longed to be more than just a shadow. She wanted to be a genie, too. She grew jealous of Gigi's power. Whisp discovered that she was not bound by the rules of the lantern. Whisp began whispering into the ears of the Finders, convincing them to use their wishes to serve her own needs. The Brothers Grimm learned of this and created a magic mirror to protect the Finders from Whisp. It was during another eclipse that Gigi felt compelled to break the rules and use the magic mirror to stop Whisp. The magic mirror was shattered into 13 pieces, but Whisp's spell over the Finder was broken. The Finder made her final wish and Gigi and Whisp were pulled back into the lantern. The defeated Whisp retreated deeper into the shadows of the lantern, hiding the 13 shards of the shattered magic mirror ...and plotting her return to power. So, that's why Gigi is so reluctant to interfere. The last time she did, it destroyed that magic mirror. Ghoulia is right, the eclipse is coming quickly! We have to find that magic mirror. Or else she'll take over the world. And we'll be trapped in here forever! According to this, the mirror was smashed into 13 pieces a long time ago. They're supposedly scattered here throughout the lantern. I've been using this map, but it keeps taking me to the wrong places. Well, we have to try. Come on! Go on, like we practiced. Oh, wow. A secret party? Hosted by the Cleo de Nile? Ooh, I am so there. Hmm. One more time. With feeling! Oops! Me bad. Hey, Lagoona, wanna study with me? Oh, no, I just want to drink this water. This fresh water. But what about the Skullastic aptitude test? I don't care about school. This is who I am now, Gil. Your parents love me and I couldn't be happier. But what about your parents? Oh, who cares? They're just a bunch of saltwater drongos, right? Okay, but, Lagoona. You're kidding, right? This isn't you! Hah! So fresh. Oh, dear. According to this map, this room has one of the mirror pieces. Magic carpets! Cool, but no mirror. A dead end. It's this map! It's useless. See, we came from here and then... What is it, Ghoulia? O- M-Ghoul! Check it out! That's the real map! A shadow map! It's on the other side! We've been going to the wrong places! Ghoulia, you are a genius! This way! We got some mirrors to collect! Howleen, are you ready to make your next wish? I have a suggestion. Gigi. Ah! Twyla, you shouldn't be here. It's not safe. I don't care. I'm still Howleen's friend. And I won't give up on her. You're very sweet, but... Gigi! I need you! - Wait. - Now! I have to go. No shadows. They are shadows! Die Trying! Die Trying! Die Trying! We're really doing this? Dude, the whole world is watching. If we back out, we'll look like scaredycats. I hate cats! The world wants to know, will you make this jump or... Die Trying! Let's get it over with. I mean, we could nail this with our hands tied behind our backs! Ooh! Great idea! Heath! Die Trying! In here! There it is! A piece of the magic mirror! Easy enough, right, ghouls? You're in my world now! Good thing we're on the fearleading team. I got this. Ah! That was kind of fun. The first one is always the easiest. Ugh! One down... Twelve more to go. Come on. There you is! Meaning to talk about your folder of silly ideas. Very funny stuff! Those weren't jokes. We are serious. "We"? And if you refuse to do them, ah, then maybe you shouldn't be president. I think it's time for you to be removed from office. Permanently. Ah! I wish... We were running out of time. The shadow eclipse was only hours away! Stop right there! Well? I'm not comfortable using my formidable mental powers in this way. Oh, really? Sure would be a shame if something were to happen to your boyfriend, InvisiBilly! Scarah, don't let her hurt me. Oh, she likes Howleen. He likes Howleen. Her. Him. Her. Him. Those four, they're not big fans at all! Come with us. Frankie, what has happened to you? Yeah, who put a bee in your bonnet? Excuse me. Where are you taking us? You will learn to love your leader. Stop, that's not very nice! Less talk, more walk! Move! You are so popular. Yeah, popular. And even the ones who don't like you will soon learn to love you. Hey, come on, let's hear some chatter! Howleen is great. She is the best. Howleen is great. She is the best. Jealous? You may have the power of wishes, but I will have power over the people. How does it feel knowing I'll have all the friends in the world and you'll be forgotten? Those aren't friends. They're mindless slaves. Not sure I see the difference. So, Cleo's throwing a comeback party, huh? We'll see about that. Howleen Wolf! To the Headmistress' office immediately. This type of behavior is not tolerated at Monster High, young lady. You will take all those banners down, immediately. She's threatened by you. Not a chance. Excuse me, I am the headmistress of this school! Not anymore. Show her the new charter. I'll spare you the read. Long story short, you're fired. You don't have the power to do that. Do it. Now. Gigi. I wish... What just happened? With Bloodgood gone, Whisp could turn the school into whatever she wanted. And no one could stop her. No one was safe. Even monsters who thought they had it good found out that you should be careful what you wish for. Can you believe what Abbey and Howleen are doing to this school? I don't care about anything except being with you. Lagoona, I'm fine! I don't... I don't need that. You're right. If you get your shirt dirty, I'll wash it for you. In fresh water! Or I'll buy you a new one with me allowance! Let me get this. You don't have to do that, either. But I do. In fact, here, have mine, too. You need your strength for the big swim meet. Well, so do you. No, silly. I quit the team. Lagoona, I don't even know who you are anymore. I'm exactly who you want me to be! You wanted to see me? Oh, you again. What have you done to Bloodgood's office? It's her office now! Just like your comeback party is now her eclipse party. You can't! How am I going to get back together with Deuce? The hottest, most popular guy in school? Sorry, dear, he's going with Howleen, the hottest, most popular ghoul in school. Hey, Howleen, it's Deuce. Um, I was told I had to go to tomorrow night's party with you or else I would be expelled, so pick you up at 8:00? And now, it's time for her to go. Gigi, the door. I'm sorry. How much longer do we have to do this? Oh! You think I'd be used to this by now. Oh, yeah! Gentlemen, there is just one last stunt. No one's ever completed it. What do you say? Can you do it or will you... Die Trying! Die trying. Yeah, yeah, we get it. What do we have to do? Die Trying! This can't be good. Hope you ghouls can handle a little heat! We're trapped! It's so hot. And it's getting closer! Ghoulia's right. We gotta get outta here now! Hey! Need to cool down? Abbey! Ha! No! Awesome, right? Come on! Let's go! How did you find us? Piece of pie. You leave more footprints than eight-legged yak. Oh, I found this one wandering around. Whisp got you too, new girl? Whisp thought she was sending us to certain doom, that we had no chance inside this lantern. There it is! This seems way too easy. She made one voltageous mistake. She sent us all here, together. It is time. Now help your sister find something nice to put on. We had 12 pieces of the mirror. One more and we were home free. The last room is right here! Oh! My back. I don't understand. We followed the map exactly. Whisp was right. We're done for! Uh, Ghoulia? The real door is inside the shadow! I put your picture on every page. Your homework for the next two months. But just so you know, you're only cheating yourself out of a quality education. Get lost, how you say, dweeb. The shadow, I can see her. I don't get it. Where are we? Oh, my ghoul. This is Whisp's room! But where is the last piece of the magic mirror? "But where is the last piece of the magic mirror?" I didn't think you'd make it this far. Impressive. But I still win. The last piece isn't in there. It never was. Where is it? Does it matter? In just minutes, it'll all be over for you and your school. Look. Quite a spectacle, too bad the only view you'll get is through my mirror. "My mirror"? I know where the last piece is! Let's get out of here! I don't think so! The exit orb! We've gotta get it back or we'll never get out of here! How? This party is totally amazing. You ain't seen nothing yet. You won't win, Whisp. Howleen's friends will stop you. Gigi, you are as big a fool as those ghouls, chasing their tails inside the lantern. They'll never make it in time. Now, remember your next wish. Just like we practiced, "I wish all power to the shadow genie. " I wish... No, no, not yet! Just a little while longer. I gotta stop her! There he is! Cut him off! Coming your way. Oh, no! Look out! All you, Frankie! No! Frankie, no! Now, let's get out of here. Take us home! No! They're back. The last mirror shard! I've gotta call Frankie. Twyla? Yes. I know. We'll be right there, here's what I need you to do. Only a few more moments before you can make your wish. You remember what it is, don't you? Give me back my sister, you shady shadow! Or else what? You don't have all the pieces, you're powerless against me. We know where the last piece is! Too late! Soon, I will rule this world. Make the wish, quickly! All power... I wish... Huh. Um... Twyla, now! No! Only Howleen knows for sure what she saw that day. Maybe she saw sides of herself she didn't even know existed or had forgotten about. Maybe she started to see herself for who she really was, freaky flaws and all. And, maybe, for the first time in her life, she genuinely liked who she was looking at. There's still time! Make the wish! Quickly! No! I'm done doing your dirty work! No, no, no. But think of the power we can have. Nope. I got everything I need right here! No! Howleen! Oh, gosh. I was so worried. Howleen. - I love you so much, sis! - Are you okay? I'm great. You guys never gave up on me. We'll always be here for you. Thank you. The eclipse is over, the danger is past. You can use your last two wishes safely now. The first one, the first one is easy. I need to fix everything I messed up. Gigi, I wish to undo all my previous wishes. As you choose. Oh, dear. Whoa, what happened? You're back. The real you! Did it work? I don't feel any different. Quick, what's my name? No idea... - Oh! - Cleo! Hey! There's my only ghoul. I got those tickets for that thing you wanted to go to... Deuce! Okay, um, cool! Squeezing a little tight there. Guys! I see the finish line! We'll be the first dudes to ever win this show! Huh? One last wish. That will send us both back to the lantern. We are ready. Do you have to go? Can't you stay? I would love to stay, experience what real teenage life is like at Monster High, but I'm a genie. There is no other way. What if there were? Whisp, come here. You thought you wanted the world. But I can see through you. Literally. I get you. You were tired of lurking in the shadows while Gigi got to go out and make friends. I know what it's like to be in someone else's shadow. You thought if you couldn't be something, you'd have to be against it. But if you were the genie... What? You'd have to follow the rules. But she's, like, evil! Howleen's right! If Whisp were the genie, then she'd be bound by the rules of the lantern. You'd have to do what your Finder wanted! You choose. That's what I'd always wanted. It's all I ever wished for! Gigi, I'm ready for my final wish. I wish that Whisp becomes the new genie... yes! Releasing you to stay at Monster High. You're gonna be okay? I will be good! Goodbye! Finder, as you wish. Goodbye! Thank you! The lantern fell into the deep end of the pool, and at Monster High, the deep end goes down forever. It will be found again when it wants to be. I hate to break up this touching moment, but anybody still feel like a party? Shame to waste all this. Howleen, how about it? Oh! I, um, didn't think I'd be invited. Don't be ridiculous, if you come, I know everybody else will. Yo, yo, yo, it's your boy, Holt Hyde on the Squeals of Steal! Don't fear the year, yeah, yeah! Let's haunt this casbah! Put your hands together for Catty Noir! Close your eyes ghoul Look inside ghoul Let the wish take you away Close your eyes ghoul Look inside ghoul Let the wish take you away I like to dream, yeah Amazing wishes so extreme I'm sorry, Gil, I know you really liked me being a freshwater ghoul. No. No. That's what my parents wanted you to be. I like you just the way you are. Good. Whoa! Because I'm gonna beat your fins off at the swim meet this weekend! It's good to have you back. Oh, it's good to be back. Hey, ghouls, what are you doing over there by yourselves? Come hang with us. That's okay. Thanks for the offer, I'm happy right where I am. Maybe we should go over there. Really? Yeah. To be honest, it gets a little boring just hanging out with you. Kidding. My monsters want to know, how was it being on such a spooktacularly dangerous show like Die Trying! It was no big woof. I chew cud tougher than that. Took a nap through most of it. Close your eyes ghoul Look inside ghoul Let the wish take you away Wishes, who wouldn't love to have them? Everybody has something they want, something they think they can't live without. We all know there are no shortcuts. But we have to work for what we want. And if you find out who you really are, you may also find out that the things you thought you wanted aren't the things you need. Whoa!
