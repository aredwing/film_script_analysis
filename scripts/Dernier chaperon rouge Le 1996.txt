The queen felt so horribly sorry for her son... that she banned him to the far and barren forest of Hocus-Pocus. For years and years the monster lived there, hidden and lonely. Until a nuclear missile from deep within the Earth turned his life upside down. This missile had in its womb thousands of hoods, full of life. The first to reach surface was more beautiful than anything else. The monster saw in the appearance a sign sent from the gods. And the slaughter began. Many girls died in his claws. Until one day, one of the girls escaped her horrible destiny. And this is how the legend of the old lady with the bad legs... Monster... Many years have passed since the monster died. And haunted by her memories of dancing... the old lady dreamed of stealing the last hood's legs. This is the insanity of everyday. So I'm telling life: I love you, life! - I feel rotten. And I want to burn myself - Tease with my fingers, smiling, my ears in the wind. Speaking with my teeth, And I, I want to make my body shiver. Come push the button and the hood will come out. Do it. She's sleeping for years - deep below the earth Hey, come on. Push the button and wake up that hood. I don't want to be done yet... where everything is hidden away. I was dying of boredom in thousand-and-one nights and thinking of him I can only say to boredom: if only he was here again, if only it was nice again, shed some light into my night, then there will only be warmth in my heart. No more here and there only dum de dum. And my little boy only gets pretty flowers a bunch of birds, and my eyes in his mouth crazy about my boy, crazy from here to there, crazy for life. I'm telling my heart that to die in your arms wouldn't be so bad. That's why I wish you were here again, that's all I'm asking for. Go touch. Touch. Her skin... so soft... sweet... Her mouth, her eyes... We are... alone in the world. Go to sleep, go to sleep. Go to sleep, little girl. Turn around and follow me onto the road of happiness. Go to sleep my little lamb. Onto the Hocus-Pocus-Trail. Come with me, come with me. You're all messed up. Go to sleep, sleep... Such long stilts. Lovely, beautiful. See you soon, girl. Come here, little rabbit. I'll squeeze you until the last drop. Your blood will be my energy. Those stilts are mine. Just for me. Just a little while and I will dance again. In my eyes I see blue suns a trip sparkling with light from a glittering cosmos, I'm up in a thousand kinds of smoke, in bubbles of sparks, A Hocus-Pocus-Garden. Where mushrooms do the Polka, in this spring I see... the metaphorcerer's voice, and suddenly my spirit leaves me diagonally A Hocus-Pocus-Garden where everything sways and swings. All the blood... Monster! Push the knob and the door will open. Time after time I see in you, alchemy in spring Time after time I read in you shivers within, but I read in these eyes I can't tell what, how horrible the fire is. The fire of despair And yet, and still I feel in these fingers the feeling of my joy, I see in this arm the wind of noise, I see in this mouth shy somethings, and on this nose I see the scent of a kiss, I hear from this ear the echo of a miracle, the sound of a night that's gone, forever. The sound of a night that's gone forever, and the sound of he who burns himself on poetry... and comma, says: I love you. We are... alone in the world. What big eyes you have. That is... That is too see you better, my child. What big hands you have. That is to touch you better, my child. Why, what big... teeth you have.
