WHAT A MODEL OF OBEDIENCE AND UPRIGHTNESS WAS JOSEPH HARPER. ALWAYS THE PROP AND COMFOR OF HIS DEAR MOTHER. ALWAYS TAKING PRIDE IN BEING WELL-DRESSED AND NEAT. YET, LET US REJOICE THAT HE IS NOW WEARING CELESTIAL RAIMENT. AND THOMAS SAWYER. I SHALL NOT SPEAK OF HIS KINDNESS TO MAN AND BEAST ALIKE... NOR OF HIS DILIGENCE IN PERFORMING HIS APPOINTED DUTIES ABOUT THE HOME. SUFFICE IT TO SAY, IN THE RECENT WORDS OF A ST. LOUIS EDITOR, "HIS LIFE WAS GENTLE, "AND THE ELEMENTS SO MIXED IN HIM "THAT NATURE MIGHT STAND UP AND SAY TO ALL THE WORLD, THIS WAS A BOY." AND LAST, BUT, OH, MY FRIENDS, BY NO MEANS LEAST, THE FIGURE WE ALL HAD COME TO LOVE- THE UNFORTUNATE, BUT ENDURING CHILD OF NATURE KNOWN AS HUCKLEBERRY FINN. HOW BRAVELY HE OVERCAME THE DISMAL HANDICAPS OF HIS PARENTAGE. HOW NOBLY HE GREW IN GRACE AND BECAME A USEFUL MEMBER. BUT NOW, ALAS, ALL 3 BLOSSOMING YOUTHS HAVE CROSSED THE GREAT RIVER. THEY HAVE STEPPED UPON THE SUNLIT SHORE. EVEN NOW, THEY MARCH. THEY MARCH INTO- TOM! TOM! OH! OH, MY BOY! MY PRECIOUS! JOE! OH, JOE! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL THIS TIME? WHO SAVED YOU? WHY, NOBODY. WE WAS JUST PLAYIN' PIRATES. Man: PLAYING PIRATES?! Second man: MAKIN' A PASSEL OF FOOLS OUT OF US! IF THEY WERE MINE, I'D LAUGH THEIR HIDE OFF. LETTING US THINK THAT THEY WERE DROWNED! THEY HAVE RETURNED TO US UNHARMED. LET US GIVE THANKS. SING AND PUT YOUR HEARTS IN IT. PLAYIN' PIRATES. JUST WAI TILL I GET YOU HOME. PRAISE GOD FROM WHOM ALL BLESSINGS FLOW PRAISE HIM ALL CREATURES HERE BELOW... I KNOW I DID WRONG TO RUN AWAY AND LET YOU THINK WE WAS DROWNED, BUT I DREAM ABOUT YOU ANYWAY. DREAM? A CAT DOES THAT MUCH. WHAT'D YOU DREAM? WHY, UH... WHY... THURSDAY NIGHT, I DREAM THAT YOU, AUNT POLLY, WERE SITTING ON THE SOFA, AND YOU WERE SITTING ON THE WOOD BOX, AND MARY NEXT TO YOU. SO WE DID. SO WE ALWAYS DO. AND JOE HARPER'S MOTHER WAS HERE. WHY, SHE WAS HERE. HMM. DID YOU DREAM ANY MORE? IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MRS. HARPER SAID SHE STILL HAS HOPES UNTIL THEY FOUND THE RAF WITH JOE'S... JOE'S... TRY HARDER, TOM! IT WAS HIS SHOES. WHY, IT HAPPENED JUST SO! MM-HMM. GO ON, TOM. OH, IT'S ALL GETTING AS BRIGHT AS DAY NOW. THEN SID SAID... I THINK HE SAID... HE BET IT WAS MY FAULT. MERCY ON US, HIS VERY WORDS. AND YOU SHUT HIM UP SHARP. I CERTAINLY DID.

AND BESIDES, I DIDN'T COME OVER HERE TO LAUGH AT YOU THAT NIGHT. WELL, WHAT DID YOU COME OVER HERE FOR THEN? TO TELL YOU NOT TO WORRY ABOUT US 'CAUSE WE HADN' GOT DROWNED. I'D GIVE THE WHOLE WORLD TO BELIEVE THAT, BUT IT AIN'T REASONABLE. BECAUSE WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME, CHILD? WELL, YOU SEE, WHEN I HEARD TALKIN' ABOUT THE FUNERAL, I GOT THE IDEA OF HIDIN' IN THE CHURCH, SO I PUT THE BARK BACK IN MY POCKE AND KEPT MUM. BARK? WHAT BARK? THE BARK I WROTE ON TO TELL YOU WE'D GONE PIRATE. WHY, IT'S STILL IN THE POCKE OF MY OLD COAT. YOU CAN LOOK AND SEE IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME. I WISH NOW YOU'D WAKE UP WHEN I KISSED YOU. I DO, HONEST.

THANK YOU, BOYS. YOU'VE BEEN MIGHTY GOOD TO ME, BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS TOWN. AND OFTEN I SAYS TO MYSELF, SAYS I, "I USED TO SHOW THE BOYS WHERE THE GOOD FISHIN' PLACES WAS "AND BEFRIEND 'EM WHAT I COULD, AND NOW THEY ALL FORGOT OL' MUFF WHEN HE'S IN TROUBLE." BUT TOM DON'T, AND HUCK DON'T. AND I DON'T FORGET THEM, EITHER. HEH. IT'S A PRIME COMFORT TO LOOK ON FACES THAT'S FRIENDLY WHEN A BODY'S IN SUCH A MUCK OF TROUBLE. GOOD FRIENDLY FACES. HEH.
