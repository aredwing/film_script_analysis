I got another load of sheets coming from county hospital in one hour. You! I'm talking to you! You, come on! Jesus. Hey, move it! Move it! Yes, sir. Good morning, Mrs. Frawley. Good morning, dear. You're looking good today, Sherry. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. You ought to watch yourself, dear. Let me help you with that. Take care of number one. Don't let the pressure get to you. What do you think about the new girl? Lin sue? Oh, she's O.K. If you're not careful, you'll end up like me. I'll keep that in mind. I wonder where the boss found her. I wish she'd go back to whatever sewer she crawled out of. Let's get that second boiler working. Do you understand me? Watch that pressure Gauge! What are you doing? I'm fixing the boiler! Coming through! Coming through! Back off now. We're coming through. Steady now. Steady now. You better tighten the belts. What? The belts... tighten them with clamps so we can get a bigger load in. Now, steady. Come on. We're way behind. Ow! What are you doing? Watch out! Aah! Aah! Stanner! Sherry! Stanner! Sir! Yes, sir! Ow! Holy shit, what was that about? Goddamn sons of bitches. These two idiots almost killed Sherry. Damn it! Jeez, I'm sorry. Are you O.K.? Moron! You could have killed her! It's nothing. I'm O.K. Sherry. You may need stitches. No. I'm O.K. Now. Mr. Gartley, sir. Do something. Get 'em back to work! Work 'em like there's no tomorrow. You boys with that piece-of-shit icebox, get it out of here! Move! Deliver on time, or you'll lose our business. Move it! Stanner, time's a-wasting. Ticktock, ticktock, tick. Ha ha ha! It's alright, George. You know, life's a bitch, then you die. Get 'em back to work. Yes, sir. We're behind schedule as it is, goddamn it. I got deadlines, George. Never enough time around here... never. You heard the man! Let's go! Move it! Don't look at me! You, get back to work. Come on, get back to work. Get back to work. Come on, work with me, ladies. Good morning. Good morning, officer. How are you? Have a nice day. Shit... shit... shit. Got the address? It's 1216 lake, or is it 1218? It's over there. Oh, fuck! What did I miss? Shit! Hey! Idiot, what was that? Hey, what was that? Hey, idiot, I'm talking to you. Hey! Hey! Hey! No, I'm talking to the other idiot. What was that? What? Can't you drive? Move the truck. Sir, we're just delivering an icebox. I don't give a fuck if you're delivering a pizza to the pope. You looking for trouble, asshole? That's officer asshole to you. Move the truck, and then we'll talk, O.K.? O.K. Sorry about your hand, Sherry. Boss, you're not kidding. This icebox is hot. Alright, Mr. gates, it's time to talk. It seems that your driver's license has expired. Watch out! Shit! Uh! Oh, I'm really sorry, officer. Get this goddamn thing off of me! Shit! Numbnuts! Jesus! Ow! Are you O.K.? Frawley! There's no time for daydreaming. I've got another load coming in. Now, both of you, back to work! Ow! Bring the ratchet. Oh! Oh! Aah! Oh, god! Aah! Oh, god! Help me! Oh, god! Help me, please! My god! Please, help! No! No! Aah! Hell's bells, Adelle! Shut it off! Aah! I don't know how! Aah! It won't shut off! Shut it off! It won't shut off! No! Aah! Goddamn! Uh! Uh! Get back! Get back! Mrs. Frawley! Oh, my god! Jesus! Oh, god! Aah! Out of my way! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, Frawley! You stupid old bitch! Always getting in the way. Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Now, what's that for? Reckless driving, illegal parking, blocking of a public street. Come on, pal. Give me a break. What do you want? Insulting an officer? Or being an arrogant, ignorant son of a bitch? Since when is that a crime? Help me, boss! Aw, you broke my damn watch. I'm all pooped out. Officer Hunton, come in. Damn it. You're a moron. Officer Hunton, come in. Officer Hunton. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Molly, what have you got? Good morning, Johnny. How's your day so far? Oh, my day's peachy, Molly. What's up? We've got a death at the blue ribbon laundry. It's a bad one. Sheriff Hughes got called away to an urgent meeting. I need some help. What's going on, and how many did you take this time? Right side up. Come on. Alright, Molly, I'm on the way. Thanks a lot. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! No! No! Sherry, it's O.K. Get away from me! Her worries are over. Get away from me! Holy shit. Hello. Is Mr. Gartley here? Mr. Gartley is unavailable. I'm Stanner. I'm the foreman. Mr. Stanner, I'm, uh... I'm officer Hunton. Can you show me what happened, Mr. Stanner? Do I have to? Yeah, you have to. She's down there. I... I can't look at it again. It makes me sick. She's down there. I can't. I'm sorry. I can't look at it. Yeah, right, you can't look. Run a loose shop, cut corners... what do you expect? People get hurt or killed, right? And then he can't look. No, he can't look at it. Oh. Hell of a mess, huh, Johnny? You know, me and my old camera were doing this long before you even came to this town. Never did get used to it. Yeah, right. Oh. Um... pictureman... Make sure I get some copies of that. Like always. Have I ever let you down? Yes. Oh! Oh. Shit. I feel like it's all my fault. I just wasn't strong enough. I tried to help her. O.K., it's alright. It's alright. Excuse me. Excuse me. It's O.K. Ex... excuse me. I know how you feel. Have you seen that machine? It makes me sick to my stomach. These will help. Mrs. Frawley used to take 'em. Oh, keep the bottle. Thank you. Annette Gillian. Uh, John Hunton. How do you do? Hi. Oh, poor Mrs. Frawley. Oh, god! Hey, what's going on? Nothing, Johnny. We're here to settle a safety issue. What's the emergency, anyway? There's been an accident with a speed ironer. Let's go in. If the safety features on this machine meet state and local standards, then you may resume operation. Yes, thank you, judge bishop. O.K., Martin, start her up. Stand clear, boys. Let's start with the safety bar. When I lift this up, the machine should stop. Uh! Put it down, it should start. What is your conclusion, Mr. Martin? Well, I'll tell you, judge bishop, the safety bar seems to be working fine. Then I declare that this was a case of accidental death. This inquest is closed. I know what you think of my work. Look, there's no such thing as empirical truth in theoretical parapsychology. If you saw Seraphims and Cherubims falling out of the sky, singing hallelujah, you wouldn't believe it. You want proof, right? Oh, you'll never change. You haven't eaten much. Why? You're not feeling well? There was an accident today... The worst one I've ever seen. Messy? So how long is it now you've been chasing corpses? 14 years. Oh, man, 14 years. You know, you need to spend some more time with the living. Ha ha ha! Jesus, you sound just like Sandy. Sandra really loved you. Whatever. Uh, I just... I just got to hang in there and get my 20 years in so I can retire and get the fuck out of this town before I turn completely numb. Yeah, well, uh, you know, Johnny, you really do need to get a life. I got a life. What I need is a beer. Come over if you want. I don't suppose you know anything about industrial laundries? You know, I used to work in an industrial laundry when I was an undergraduate at Berkeley. Get out of here. I did, man. Really? Yeah, sure. Well, look, do you know that machine they call the speed ironer? Oh, man, yeah. It's called a mangle. A mangler? Mangle. That's the one. That's the one. It mangled a woman this morning... Oh! Over at Mr. Gartley's blue ribbon laundry. It... There was hardly anything left of her. No way. No way, man. That can't happen. You've got a safety bar. If someone's feeding the machine and get their hand underneath, the bar snaps up and turns the damn thing off. Well, that's how I remember it. Yeah, it's got a safety bar, but it happened anyhow. Oh, god. Man, what a way to go. I hated that machine. Oh, fuck me! I can't do this! Well, it is what it is, right? Johnny, don't. I mean, you can't... What? A woman's dead, mark. It folded her like a sheet. They carried her out in a basket. Whose ass is on the line? Nobody's ass is on the line. Gartley owns judge bishop. Judge bishop owns the sheriff. I mean, it's all dirty. It's all dirty. Yeah, but why are you fighting it, man? I mean, wake up. I've been in this town long enough to know that there's some strange shit going on. It's always been narrow-minded and corrupt. Hell, they used to burn witches just 10 miles from here. This puritanical ethic is still hanging over... Look, don't start with the sprout-breath political mystical bullshit, mark. I'm not in the mood this evening. Thank you. The woman's dead, and that machine is running right now, alright, like nothing happened... business as usual... 6 miles from here... 6 miles. Oh, whatever. What are you supposed to do about it, huh? Have a beer. That's what I'll do. You're going to take the sins of the world on your shoulders? I mean, you have to live a little. You can't just take everything in. Yeah, you're right. Come on. Just live a little. You're going to get a goddamn nervous breakdown. I'm worried about you. You want some yogurt? I got some yogurt. Is it whole-wheat? Granola? I got granola. Yeah, is it organic? No. Are you O.K.? I wish I could go home. Aah! Aah! Aah! Move away! Move away from there! Do something! Aah! Aah! Aah! Shut that damn thing off! Inside. I'm sorry. Chaos abounds, my dear. You'd better get used to it. Like I told you, there's no free lunch, no sirree, Bob, not in this lifetime. Uh-uh. Still, life must be better here than on the streets, hmm? Here, the predators are few. The benefits are many, hmm? Hmm? Mmm. For I am a generous man. I...Am a man of my word. Now, then... Why don't you go in there and freshen up for your uncle Billy? Go on now. Draw your bath. Skedaddle. O.K. Shoo. Shoo. Shoo fly. Would you like to come in here and keep me company? Uh! Lin sue, Lin sue, you sweet young woman. I'll tell you, the one thing worse than the devil within... Is the devil without. Save my seat. Hello. Yeah. What? What? What is it? There's been another accident at the laundry. A steam hose broke loose on that machine, burned three women. One of them is at the hospital. Hey, can I come with? Hey, Pascal, how you liking public service? Oh, you know. Can you tell me what room Annette Gillian is in, please? Room 132. Thank you. Annette! Annette! Remember me? I'm officer Hunton. Oh, I thought you were the doctor. Well, go get a goddamn doctor! Wh-where is he? Where's the doctor? Oh, god! What took you so long? That's it. Take it easy, Annette. Take it easy. Annette, Annette, take it easy. This is going to take the pain away, huh? No pain allowed in this hospital. There we go. That's it. What do you want? I'm officer Hunton. I'm here to ask Annette about the accident. I don't think she's up to it. I don't think I want a second opinion. Annette, what happened? We was running sheets, and the ironer just blew up. Mr. Stanner said there must have been a surge from the boiler or something. I don't know. Has anything like this ever happened before? It all started happening when Sherry cut her hand on one of the clamps. On the mangler? Yeah. Was there blood? Well, I mean, did she bleed on the mangler? There was blood everywhere, and then later... Mrs. Frawley... I think she's had enough. She needs some rest. Annette, thank you very much. Sherry Ouelette... Mr. Gartley's niece, just out of high school. Mr. Gartley watches her like a hawk... Has all her life. Won't let her have any boyfriends or go on dates. You know, it's almost like that machine had tasted blood and found it liked it. Don't women get funny ideas sometimes? Thank you very much, Annette. You'll be fine. Bye-bye. Thanks. Come on. Annette, I just wanted to ask... Mark... Come. Safety inspector barely had time to check the machine. They railroaded that inquest through. Said, "everything's O.K. Put those kids back to work." And then, kapoom... Three women burned, one kid's disfigured for life. Now, that's against the law in my book. So, what do you think? Mark? What? What's going on in that jelly-roll head of yours? Nothing. Right. That would be a first. Barry! Barry! Was that Mrs. Ellenshaw? Yeah. Take it easy, man. Right. You, too. Hey, man... Why don't you come on over? There's something important I want to show you. Six-pack of beer? No. Come on. Are you hungry? No. I'm going to bed. Come on. It's really important. Come on. Ah, what the fuck. Cold beer? Is that all I'm good for? You know how to hurt a guy. That's no way to treat your brother-in-law. I suppose you'd follow me to the ends of the earth if I asked. That's right. I'd follow you to the ends of the earth. Come. Frazer's golden bough... Check it out. You might learn something. "Frazer's golden bough... "The definitive work on magic and the occult." Check it out. Check it out. Have you considered the possibility that the machine might be haunted? Oh, yeah. Oh, yes, mark. Yes. That's the first thing that popped into my mind. No. Play along with me. Maybe "haunted" is not a good word. Let's say "possessed." Possessed. Yeah. Yeah, man. Possessed. Possessed? Yeah! Possessed. By the parrot demon, right? O.K., O.K. We're going to grab that bad boy by the throat, shove a couple cloves of garlic up his butt, that'll be the end, right? Man, this stuff's for real. I'm serious about this. Check it out. This stuff is for real. If you just look in here, I mean, everything is pointing... Mark... Check it out. First there is god, then there's country, and then there's the law. Alright? The rest is bullshit. O.K.? This is bullshit, mark. Reality, bullshit. Bullshit, reality. This is bullshit. Aah! Help! Whoa! I got you. I got you. Aah! Aah! It's O.K. It's O.K. Shh. It's alright. It's alright. You'll be O.K. You'll be O.K. Bring her up here, George. But, Mr. Gartley, she's hurt, sir. Mr. Gartley, she needs a doctor. She needs help. My finger! Bring her to me. All spells can be reduced to simple common denominators. European spells mention the hand of glory, and that's real trouble. Spells need a catalyst... Either herbal or human or both. The answer is in that book. Just go for it! Carry on. Come on. Come on. Read on, man. Belladonna, hand of glory... Blood of a virgin! Now, that's supernatural. Supernatural is a really misleading word, man. Witches, demons, spirits... All part of nature. Like, um... O.K. A demon is a kind of energy like electricity... Or fire. Sometimes it gets out of control, and people get hurt. Thought you might want something to eat. Thank you. The most powerful spells always incorporate belladonna. What is belladonna? The hand of glory, or deadly nightshade. The plant? Yeah. And the most common ingredient in all these spells is, uh, the blood of a virgin. You must admit the way Annette describes Sherry, she sounds the type. Oh, come on. Come on. Go with the flow. Think of the possibilities. Could be fun, huh? Alright. Hey, mark, tell you what. I'll run right on over to Sherry Ouelette's house, O.K.? Knock on the door. "Sherry? Hi. "My name is officer John Hunton. "I'm with the police department here, "and I am investigating "a laundry machine "with a bad case of demon possession, "and I need to examine you to determine whether or not you're a virgin." Right? Mmm... mm-hmm. Huh? Mark, I could just see my report. They would tar and feather me and run me out of this town on a rail. You think so? Ha ha ha! That sounds like a whole lot of fun to me. Oh, yeah! Oh, boy! Why don't we just go there and talk to her? Do it for me. Come on. Johnny? Johnny, I got that info for you. Yeah, Molly, go ahead. Let's see. Sherry Ouelette... Parents died in a car accident on 7-10-83. William Gartley is her legal guardian. Is that it? Yeah. Who's picking up the tab for my overtime? Take it out of my pension. You're the best, Molly. You got that right. Oh, man. So who's going to pop the ques... You don't say a word. Right? Not a word. Far out. Gothic. Who is it? Sherry? Hi. It's officer John Hunton from the police department. Hi. Remember me? Mm-hmm. I'm here to ask you some questions about the accidents that have been happening at the blue ribbon laundry. Are you a policeman, too? No. I'm a theoretical... Um, this is mark Jackson. He's a student... An observer. Then I guess it's alright. Thank you. It won't take long. Is your uncle here? I'm alone. Oh, hey, look at those. They're beautiful. Look at that little face! Are they yours? No, they're not really mine. My uncle says they'll be mine someday. Um... Sherry, I'm really sorry to disturb you at a time like this. I just have a few questions. O.K.? O.K. It's O.K.? Alright. Now, Annette said that you cut your hand on a clamp. How did that happen? Getting out of the way of that icebox. These two guys lost control. I guess it... It hit the feed belt. On the mangler? Yeah. Then it bounce off and almost hit me. Did this icebox hit the safety bar? I think it did. There were bright sparks everywhere. What? Sparks like a wire had been cut? I saw a big flash like lightning or something. That's it, then. There it is. I really loved Mrs. Frawley. Shh. She was like a mother to me. I tried to help her. I pulled as hard as I could, but I was too weak. It's O.K. Sherry, Sherry. Sherry. Sherry, you're a very brave young woman. O.K.? Sherry... I just want... Mark! The icebox hit the safety bar. That's it. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. It was a short circuit. That's all there is to it. Let's go. Mark! Mark! Sherry, are you a virgin? Excuse me? What is this? Just get out! Just get the hell out! What did I tell you? What did I tell you? I'm right! I'm right. She's definitely a virgin. Jesus Christ! I can't believe you did that... Talk to a little girl like that. God! Have fun? Shit, I hope you had fun. It's not a question of fun. I know I'm right. Shut up, goddamn it. No more about virgins. I'm right. What are you... some kind of pervert? Doesn't matter whether I'm a pervert... What is this? Oh, Christ. What is going on at Mrs. Smith's house? Whatever it is, you stay the hell out of it. There he is! There he is! Stop him! Mark! Stay in the car. Alright. You stay in the car! Alright! Alright! Hey, Steele, what is this? Hi, Johnny. It's really bad. The boy's suffocated. It's Barry Ellenshaw. Been missing all day. Mrs. Smith just learned 10 minutes ago. I found that icebox when I got here this morning. He never got in any trouble. He'd no more play in a refrigerator than... Alright. The boy's dog was barking outside the icebox. That's why I had a look inside. Oh, Barry. Suffocated, poor kid. He's been missing since 11:00 this morning. Come on, honey. Rest in peace, Barry. Barry Ellenshaw... Oh, man. Poor kid. Hell of a shame, huh, Johnny? Get him out of here. Stand back there. Stand back. No! No! No! No, Maryanne. No! Barry! Stop! Oh, my baby! Stay there. Stay there. No! Barry! It's not my fault. I had nothing to do with it. It was here when I came home from work. What? It's not yours? No. I don't know where it came from. Hey, Johnny, come have a look at this. Wait a minute. What? This is the son of a bitch that almost hit Sherry? After it hit the mangler. Transference. It's transference of evil. Oh, bullshit. Evil. Bullshit. Easy. What? Shit. It's alright. It's alright, little baby. It's alright, baby. Come on. Aah! Jeez! Let go! Aah! Aah! Are you alright? Yeah. I think so. Oh, shit. Jesus Christ. A hammer... You got a hammer? It's in the garage. Ow! Miserable piece of dogfuck! Goddamn you! Oh, oh, god. God! Jesus Christ! God! Lend not thy sight to idols nor make gods of thyself! Nice work, Johnny. I always knew you had it in you. Where did you learn to do magic tricks? That was the first ghost I have ever seen. Thank you, my boy. Just when you thought you'd seen it all, life bites you in the ass. See you later, Johnny. I'll be waiting for you. What the fuck was that? Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Get that thing out of my sight! And burn it... Then bury it. Drive a fucking stake through its heart. So, what do you think now? Do you know any priests? No, man. Do you? No. I knew a rabbi one time. They'd think we're nuts. We are nuts. It's our play, Johnny. It's up to us. Why don't we just get some dynamite and blow the shit out of the pig? Brute force isn't the answer, man. I mean, a demon may be trapped in that piece of machinery. There's a chance it could get out, it would love to get out, to kill oh, good. Good. Virgin blood. That's the key. It's got to be. The trouble is there's many different kinds of demons. I don't know what we're dealing with. It could be in the cycle of bubastis, pan, Dionysius. You following me? No... but go on. I have to isolate the exact cause. We have to make sure that we use the right ritual because the rites of exorcism... I don't know if you understand but that's really heavy stuff. That's like controlled nuclear fission. We make one mistake, that's it. We're dead. We're destroyed. If you ask me, this is just an act of random possession. It's got to be. Hey, mark. I got to do some thinking. Oh, Johnny, listen, man, don't worry, O.K.? I'm with you 100%, man, O.K.? Alright, mark. That's a relief, man. 100%. That's real reassuring. Belladonna, demonic possessions... Oh, I'm having fun. I'm with you, man. There are stranger things in heaven and earth, John Hunton, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. Ha ha ha! Hey, Johnny, what do you know? Not much, Tyrone. Just going to the morgue. Whew. Not much. Barry, it's been a hell of a day. Fix you up in the morning. He's a brave kid, he put up a hell of a fight, broke his arm in six places. It was suffocation, right? Mr. Hunton, we've been expecting you. You've come to see Mrs. Frawley. She was a real challenge. I had practically nothing to go on. Hardly recognized the parts... the ones that came in. You look at her now. I think I did a pretty good job, considering the raw materials I had to work with. Can you keep a secret? I had to fill up her body with... I hate secrets. O.K. O.K., yeah. You need to be alone. You've come to do some thinking. I'll be in my office. Okay, I'll call you if I need anything. She's headed to the cemetery in the morning. Until then, she's all yours. Great, thank you. Oh, her personal possessions. They're right here. Great. That's all they brought in. Cherry tomato? No, thank you. Bye-bye, now. Oh, Jesus. You won't mind, will you? Jesus, I got to get a life. Boo. Got you. Very funny. She looks... pretty good, don't she? Oh, yeah. She looks great. Johnny. Johnny! You want to come downstairs? We'll finish off that gin game we started three years ago. I've still got a drop of that Irish whiskey. You know, I get the feeling you don't like me anymore. No. It's my job I don't like anymore. Oh. Well, it doesn't matter much anyway. You won't have to look at my ugly mug around here much longer. Why? Don't tell me you're moving out of this hellhole. Oh, something like that. The doc says I'm going fast. I'm being eaten up... inside. I'm sorry to hear that. Ah, don't be. We all have to go sometime. Johnny, you and I... We share the same ghosts. To forgive is divine... Especially if you can forgive yourself. Oh, did you get pictures of that icebox? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm off down to the darkroom now. What was that? What? That ghost. We live in strange times, Johnny... Very strange times. I'll have the photos ready later tonight. Come on by. I'll be waiting for you. You know, I'm 50 points up on you in that game. I've got an Ace up my sleeve I'm dying to play. You know where to find me. You're going to lose to an old hack like me. Shit. Fuck. Aah! What are you doing? Where the hell is Gartley? He's out of town. Yeah, right. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come back here! Hey, stop! Goddamn it, he's out of town. Get your hands off of me, you lying sack of shit. You want to go downtown? You want to go downtown? Boys! Boys! All right. Knock it off. Get out, George. I'll deal with you later. Come in, Mr. Hunton. I've been expecting you. So sorry I missed you earlier. You know, Stanner tells me you're quite the detective. A regular Sherlock Holmes of the dead, hmm? Why don't you shut that thing down before somebody else gets hurt? What, am I going to have to shut you down? Tsk tsk tsk. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Mmm. Bad career move. Are you threatening me? Is that a threat? Go on, threaten me. I'll shove them crutches up your moldy ass. Ha ha ha! I like that. Threaten? Uh-huh. No, no, no. Threaten is far too... kind a word. This goddamn machine tried to kill me! Breaking and entering is a serious crime, officer. Perhaps I should have you arrested, hmm? Yeah. O.K. O.K. Hey. Yeah. Have me arrested. I'm going to shut you down, you sick son of a bitch. I will not have you tamper with my affairs. I'll have you suspended! Hey, all your powerful friends and all your money don't mean shit to me, Gartley. Ha ha ha! My power has nothing to do with money. Power is energy. Power is motivation. Power is what holds things together when they would rather fly apart. It's a complex world out there, sporty. Many things you do not understand. But... understand this. There's a little bit of me in that machine and a little bit of it in me. We are the lifeblood of this town. Gartley, what are you talking about? We all have to make sacrifices. You're right. Everything has its price. Yeah. Yes, it does. Well, do come again. This has been delightful. And, uh... drive carefully, won't you? Fuck you! What? That s.O.B. He thinks he's going to shut down our machine. Ha ha ha! Well, sir, I've been thinking... Maybe it should be shut down. Yeah... how long you worked here, George? 15 years. 15 years. Well, you're... You're practically part of our little family, then, aren't you, hmm? I assume you'll be helping us run this town, hmm? I've known that machine since I was a little boy. My daddy bought it. Best business decision he ever made, I'll tell you. My god, Mr. Gartley, sir. That... that machine killed your daughter. Look what it's done to you. Yeah. Sacrifices, George. We all have to make them. Hell, boy. You could say that machine out there made me what I am. Mr. Gartley, if you're not going to deal with it, then... maybe I should. Oh, don't be a fool, George. Don't throw away a bright future here. I'm worried. Worried, uh... It's been troubling me. Well, George, let your own conscience be your guide. Good evening, Martha. Bill. Bill Gartley. Sorry to call so late. Let me speak to the good sheriff, won't you, Martha? Thank you. Evening, Hughes. Now listen, I'm having a little problem with one of the boys. Yeah. That's the fellow. That's right. Now you deal with him. O.K, nighty-night. Fuck him. John? What? Take some time off. There's no case here, son. Take a vacation! O.K., Mr. Gartley. Now you're suspended, officer Hunton. Hey, how much is he paying you, Hughes? O.K., pal. You're terminated! And kiss that pension good-bye. How are we feeling, my dear, hmm? Strange. I'm getting sick. Are you ready for bed? Yes. No! No. There's something I must show you. Come. Must be here somewhere. Aha! Yeah. My baby daughter's death certificate. Her passport to hell. She was only 16. Hmm. Well, survival of the fittest is the way of things. I mean, surely, my child, you must have noticed how Rikers valley is so ideally perfect, hmm? There's something I want to show you. Just a moment here. Ah! Ah. This... is my contract... My deal... With the beast... The beast in the machine. What's happening to me? My child, there's a little piece of you in the mangler and the essence of it in you. You're one of us now. My signature. See? Hmm? Oh. Understand now? Do we? Hmm? See? Welcome to the club. Oh, precious. Fuck! I've been studying, man. Virgin's blood. Definitely virgin's blood. It's got to be. Now, look. A little holy water, a smidgen of Eucharist... That ought to do it. We'll read some leviticus. Christian white magic. Listen, I'll tell you the truth. I was really worried about that hand of glory... belladonna. That's black Ju Ju. Strong magic. Hey, mark? I looked down this son of a bitch's throat. Holy water ain't going to do it. Yeah, well, a demon conjured up in conjunction with the hand of glory can... I mean, that could eat a stack of bibles for breakfast, but we don't have to worry about that. Thank god. Alright. You know, I hope you're right. I know I'm right. I don't. We got to go talk to somebody. Come on. Hold up! Damn it, hold up! I don't know about this, George. What the hell took you so long? I'm sorry. Are you sure we're doing the right thing? Yeah. Now, don't start arguing with me now. Go over there, cut all power, and pull the breakers. I'll start on the feeder. Sherry? What are you doing here? I have to see my uncle. That's not a good idea. He's very upset. I can't work here anymore. The police came and asked me questions. I got to speak to him. Police. That figures. Just don't go up there. He's busy. Lin sue's with him, isn't she? Sherry, go on home now. I have to talk to him. Oh, oh, oh. I'm caught! Mr. Stanner! I'm caught! Help! Aah! Mr. Stanner! The fuses! Jesus! Aah! Mr. Stanner! Mr. Stanner! Aah! Aah! Turn it off! Oh, god! Aah! Mr. Gartley! Aah! Oh, help me! Help me! Oh, please! Please! Do something! Do something? Do something? I'll do something. I'll dance, that's what I'll do. I'll do a little dance for you, Sherry. Oh, god. Mr. Gartley! A little jig. I need your help now. We're running out of time. Come on. Please! Please! Aah! Uncle bill, please! Move like there's no tomorrow. We're on the clock. Aah! Do it! Do it! I can't! Do it! Do it! Do it now! Oh, Christ. I can't, George. Do it! Aah! Do it! Do it! Do it! Christ! Do it! Very good, children. Come here to your uncle bill. Sherry! Sherry! Oh! Oh! I used to have all... The time... in the world. Damn her. Damn her. Oh! Oh! Hey, hey. Hey, man, where the hell we going? We're going to go talk to an old man. Oh, no. What the hell was this? No. Take me back. Joey, stop! Don't argue. Just do it. I was just drinking my tea, and... You're alright. You'll be O.K. You're going to be alright. You'll be O.K. Thanks for coming and visiting me, Johnny. You made an old man very happy. Just breathe. Just breathe. Downstairs... In my office. Present for you. You have to exorcise your demon. Don't let it possess your soul. Oh. Shit! Oh, man. It wasn't your fault. I was driving the car. Accidents happen. People make mistakes, but they carry on. Johnny. Take a look at this. This is my present. "Maryanne Gartley, daughter of William Gartley, "was killed at the blue ribbon laundry yesterday "when she apparently fell into the new speed ironer. "She died on her birthday. She was 16 years old." There's Maryanne. "Sarah Krandel was reported missing yesterday "when she failed to show up at her 16th birthday party." That's Sarah. "Suzanne bishop still missing. "Suzanne bishop, daughter of judge bishop, "was reported missing yesterday. She was last seen at her 16th birthday party." "Lois Hughes... Chatterton..." Well, these are all the rich people, the old money... The people who want nothing, need nothing more... Power. Power. What is this? Wait a minute. Everything has its price. The price of power... Gartley said something about... No, Gartley said... That we all have to make sacrifices. Human sacrifices. Sherry? Jesus Christ. Hi. Sherry? This is officer Hunton. Mr. Stanner's dead. I just went to see my uncle. Um, listen, Sherry. I want you to stay inside. Want you to stay in the house. Lock the doors. You'll be safe as long as you stay inside. What's going on? How old are you, Sherry? 16? Really? Stay inside. Do what I told you, O.K.? I'll explain everything when I get there. I'll be there as soon as I can, O.K.? The mangler got the foreman. Today's her birthday. She's 16. It's her birthday? We're running out of time. Happy birthday, my child. Surprised to see your uncle bill? What do you want? Why, you, of course. Leave me alone. Ohh... Aren't you going to blow out your candles? Come on. Go ahead, Sherry. Make a wish. I wish you were dead. Ha ha! No doubt about it, girl's got true Gartley spirit. Ugh! Oh, what a waste, but then, we all... Have to make sacrifices. Heh heh! Now, now, now. Uh, no! Oh, I'm so sorry it had to be you, but I must not be selfish when I make my decision, so it's time to turn in your dance card. Heh heh! I do hope you'll accept my apology, but I must choose between you and me, and of course, I choose... Me. Come, darling. We're running out of time. Stop! Stop! We haven't got time, mark. I have to rehearse. We haven't got time! I have to rehearse. Alright. Fuck! O.K., I'm going to read. I might read from the Latin, or the English, but I'm going to read anyway. O.K., this... this... This, my friend, is holy water. Holy water. Fine. When I give you the signal, you take this, and you sprinkle it on the machine, and you say, "in the name of the father, "the son, and the holy ghost, get thee from this place. Thou art unclean." This is the host. You break the host. You put it on the machine. You repeat the incantation. Oh! The hand of glory... We don't have to worry about that. Get in the car. Get in the goddamn car! You always do this to me! Wait up! God of all machines, god that meshes good and evil... Accept this blood of my blood, because I am signing off... Payment in full! See you later, Sherry. Sherry! No! Piss off! Get on out. You've got no right! You have no right! Oh... You have no right! Agh! No right! No right! No... Aaah! God! Goddamn you! You miserable piece of dogfuck! How dare you! No! So this is the price of power? This is the price of power? Ugh! No! No! No! No! Here's the truth, Gartley. It's done. No! No! Lin sue. Aaah! Lin sue! Lin sue! Lin sue! O.K.? Stay with me. Trespassers! Lin sue! My Lin sue! Off the clock. Out of time? Aah! My god, who art in hell, cursed be thy name... Why, you lying son of a b-b-b... Fuck you. Stay back! Stay back! What do you want me to do? Help me. When I point to you, take the holy water, sprinkle it in the machine, and you say, "Gloria in excelsis spiritu omnibus." Omnibus. O.K., alright. Gloria in excelsis spiritu sancto omnibus. Then you put the host in. Repeat the incantation. Gloria in excelsis spiritu sancto omnibus. In the host! In the name of the father, the son, and the holy ghost, get thee from this place! Thou art unclean! Holy shit! This ain't working! Shit. Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses... Trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is the power, the goodness and the glory forever... ...sight to idols nor make gods of thyself, for the land will vomit you up for defiling it as it vomited up nations before thee! Amen, goddamn it! Look! Yeah! We did it! Huh? We did it! We did it! We did it. Ha ha ha! It's dead! Uh... Oh, man. Now I know where you get your flaky stomach from. Let me take those I don't do drugs, but I need this. You O.K.? Really? What's in this? I don't know. They're antacids. I got them from Mrs. Frawley. Belladonna? You got these from Mrs. Frawley? The hand of glory? I think we may be fucked. Ah! Oh, god! Oh, what's this? Aah! Oh, shit! Oh. Oh. Oh, god! No! Agh! Run! Run! Mark! Run! Run! Out! Get out! Out! Oh! Oh! Oh! Do you know a way out of here? No! No! Run! Run! Go! We're fucked! We're fucked! Oh, god! No! Ohh! No! John! Mark! It... it won't open! If I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil. Aaah! John! No! Johnny! Mark! No! Mark! No! Come here! What are you doing? Let go! Save yourself! It wants me! Over my dead body! Are you crazy? No, I'm a policeman. But it wants me! It wants me! Sherry! Sherry! Sherry! Jump! Leave her alone, goddamn you! Leave her alone! No! Goddamn you! Leave her alone! Sherry's alright. She's lost a lot of blood, but she'll recover. Thank god. Mind telling me what happened? Yeah, I do mind. Can I go see her? No. She's resting. Maybe tomorrow. O.K. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Tomorrow. Morning, officer. Have a nice day. Dearest Johnny, in this envelope you'll find vital information that may save your life. The old-timers in Rikers valley had a saying... Beware of people with missing parts. There's a piece of each of them in the demon and a dose of the demon in each of them. "Faithfully yours, J.J.J. Pictureman." Herb! I've got a big load of sheets coming within the hour! Now, get a move on! Come on, ladies! Move it up! There's never enough time around here! I'm not running a charity here, herb! Tell them to get their lazy asses in gear! Sherry? You heard the boss! Keep moving!
