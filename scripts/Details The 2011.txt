You're sifting through all the little things, all of the details. One of the details was this house plant which I picked up at Trader Joe's. Another was purchasing this bottle of poison. And then there was... ...this kidney, some sleeping pills, this transaction at the bank and... ...clicking onto this adult internet site which I had spent many, many hours enjoying. But after all was said and done, you could say my downfall really began on a fairytale kind of day... ...when my wife and I started talking about having a second child. The thing was our house. It had two bedrooms and we wanted to expand it to make room for a new nursery. So off I went to the Department of Building and Safety, where I'd be told that our plans were not to code and be given this variance hearing request form. And although I'm the only one to blame for the whole big mess you're about to see... ...still I wish I'd known upfront about this plate of cheese and salami. "Memories Are Made of This"] # Sweet, sweet Memories you gave-a me # # You can't beat The memories you gave-a me # # Take one fresh and tender kiss # # Add one stolen night of bliss # # One girl, one boy # # Some grief, some joy # # Memories are made of this # Hey, lookin' good. - # Don't forget a small moonbeam # - Lookin' good, guys. Muy bien, amigos. # Fold in lightly with a dream # # Your lips and mine # Can I have everybody's attention, please? Quiet, quiet, please. My gorgeous wife would like to pontificate about the happy couple. - Thank you, thank you. - Sweetheart. Uh, you guys have now been married for ten years, which is a very, very, very long time. Very, very, very long time. - In a good way. - In a great way. Uh-huh. And, um... we just really wanna say congratulations. Jeff, you are... one of my oldest and dearest friends, and I'm so happy that you're this lucky in love. - To Jeff and Nealy! - To Jeff and Nealy! Ten more years! # Sweet, sweet Memories you gave-a me # # You can't beat The memories you gave-a me # # With his blessings from above... # Nealy. Remember when we were twenty-two? We used to F-U-C-K like three times a day. What do you say, when you get little buddy guy into his bed, we go relive our youth in ours? You know, I... I had so many of those, um, Copper River salmon finger foods. I just... I really think I'd puke. Hey, babe. Thanks for clicking me. My name is Jasmine Jane. I think of myself as a tasty fruit and I would love to make your banana cry. Nealy. Come here. Whoa. What did this? No idea. Hey, Jeff! You think maybe it's gophers? Nealy. It's raccoons. Buenas dias, Senor Lang. Hey, how's it going, Alma? You all right? - I'm going inside, too. - You're gonna go inside? OK. Will you say bye to me first? I gotta go, I gotta go to work. Ahhh. All right, have fun today, OK? - OK. - OK, I love you. Whoa! Whoa! Sorry. Hi, Traci. - Hey, Dr. Lang. - How you doin'? - Good. - Good to see you. Thank you. Good shot, Doc. Keep takin' that! Hey, good playin' tonight, Doc. You were on fire. Thanks, man. What happened to you? You were lookin' sluggish out there. Well, that'll happen when you're 50 and workin' double shifts to make ends meet. But if you wanna hit the weight room right now, we can see which one of us is stronger. Oh... no, no, no, no. I don't wanna embarrass you. All right, Doc. So we got a notice from the Department of Building and Safety this morning. It turns out the city wouldn't even consider our variance request. - Oh. - Yeah. But... I say screw it. We go ahead without the permit. Yeah, but what if we get caught? I mean, wouldn't we have to tear it all out and redo it? It would cost like twice as much. I'm sure we could avoid getting caught. What if the whackadoodle neighbor complains? The whackadoodle neighbor. Well... I think we can persuade her not to. Hello. Hello, Dr. Lang. - I was just stopping by... - Quiet, Steven! Sorry. No problem. So, the reason I was stopping by is we're planning on doing a little home improvement next door and I wanted to apologize for any inconvenience in advance and give you this as a token of my appreciation. It's a beautiful plant. A lovely flower. Well, I really tried to pick out just the perfect one. Well... ...I should probably skedaddle. Bye. Look! There's Daddy! Watch your step. Now when these little suckers run down this tree... ...I can hear them coming and I can run outside and scare the living S-H-I-T out of them. Great. Are the raccoons up there? Daddy thinks they're up there. That's why Daddy is spreading stinky coyote urine all over to scare them off, even though we've got tons of real coyotes all over the place. Actually, it's mountain lion urine. Higher up on the food chain, and I think it smells delicious. Hey, you know, maybe we should think about putting in a series of pathways and pocket gardens, like out front, and not give the raccoons anything to turn over. Go. Hey! Drop that! Stop! Come on! Fucker! Hey, Doc. Hey, Lincoln, what's up? Where is everybody? Don't know, Doc. No one showed up yet. How's the baby business? - It's good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Gotta warm up. How's everything for you? You, uh, you still workin' at that nightclub? Oh, no. Quit that a while back, too much strife. Working for the, uh, Manufacturers Mineral Company... hauling, uh, rocks and gravel. It's been cool. I was gonna ask you about that shirt, - but it says "Leonard" on it. - That's my name, Doc. Lincoln's just a nickname my teammates gave me in college. - Basketball teammates? - Yep. They used to call me "Link" because, uh, when I joined the squad, fellas said they no longer had a weak link in the lineup. Then that became "Lincoln," because I led 'em out of the slavery of a third place team. I guess it doesn't surprise me you were such a stud in college. - Yeah? - When we first started playing together, - before you got old and slow. - Oh, damn, man. I, uh, I thought you played well enough to have been pro. I almost did, Doc, but it wasn't in the cards. Huh. Why not? Well, I'll tell you the story if you want to hear it. - Yeah, sure. - All right. Whoo. Good shot. It was my sophomore year... ...and we had a real good team. I mean, real good. We had, uh, just won the big game. - Clinched our conference. - Wow. And, uh... damn. It was like a dream, Doc. Like a real dream. They get in this huge car accident and that's it. That's it. His career's over. It's like over and like right, right when he would turn pro, too. It's, it's, it's like a crusher. He's always got these pieces of gauze taped to his arm. Turns out the poor guy's got kidney failure. Jesus. It's amazing how you can know someone for so long, but you never really know 'em. Wow. He's got these terrible, cracked teeth. I was thinking about paying for him to go to the dentist, but I don't know. Well, you know, if his passion's really basketball... - Mmm. - ...you should talk to Ron's sister about that school she runs. Maybe they have a coaching job open. That's not a bad idea. Hi. Sorry to bother you, Dr. Lang, but when your guys broke through your wall the other day a bunch of dust got into my house. Oh. I'm really sorry about that. I also, I, I noticed that you're expanding your front room towards our house. - Right. - I looked it up for me on the internet. The code is to leave a five foot passage. What can I do? You can't see it anymore because I spent hours cleaning everything with white vinegar and a toothbrush. But you can see it on the TV here. Oh. Wow, well, I can have the guys working on my project come by and clean up for you. I hardly think that a, a laborer who hammers and saws all day would know how to clean my house. Yeah, you might be right about that. And this has been very, very hard on me. I mean, with all this dust just, it's just floating around. Just look! It's everywhere! See? It's everywhere! Here, you see it? I mean, you're a doctor. You've heard of environmental illnesses. - Sure, I've heard of 'em. - That's, that's why I keep this basil leaf pinned to my lapel. It purifies the air. My naprapath suggested it. It's been a lifesaver. Well, I'm very happy to pay for a professional cleaning service if you need it. Whatever the cost. You give me the bill, I'll write the check. I just want you to be happy. That's very nice of you. Not at all. All right, I should get goin', so... - Dr. Lang? - Yeah? I heard you last night... ...try to scare away your raccoons. Oh, I'm sorry about that. That's OK. I don't sleep much anyway. - You don't sleep? - No. I get a little every few weeks, but... ...basically I'm a night creature. Huh. Well, I could get you some samples of Ambien from the office. It might help with that. - Really? - Yeah. You know what? I'll drop 'em in your mailbox when I get home from work. Nealy! Wow, this stuff is burning the skin of my hand just touching it! I doubt a raccoon is gonna come back here after he snorts up a nose full of this. So... I read online today about this guy... ...he sticks a barrel into his grass and he throws steaks in, and during the night, the raccoons, they jump in, but they can't climb out. He runs a hose from his garage out of the tailpipe from his car, he sticks a lid on and asphyxiates them. You know, I really don't feel like talking about this five nights a week. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bore you. We should re-landscape without sod, like I keep telling you. You know, fifteen hundred square feet of grass and a new irrigation system was expensive. You just don't throw it away. Please don't use that tone with me. I didn't use any tone with you. OK, don't deny using a tone when you use a tone. I'm not crazy, I know what I just heard. I didn't call you crazy. But you implied it, though, didn't you? As if I'm not sane enough to judge your tone of voice. - Maybe you are crazy. - Oh, oh, right. Oh, oh, now the truth comes out. - Well, you want to know the truth? - Yeah, sure, I love the truth. OK. The truth is, you are the crazy one, OK? - Right, yes, of course I am. Yeah. - With these goddamn raccoons, you are acting like a complete fucking deranged moron. Now I'm acting like a fucking deranged moron? - Keep your fucking voice down. - You keep your fuckin' voice down. Don't you dare wake up Miles. This is it! This is perfect! This is just what you want, isn't it? - What is what I want? - You want me to get crazy - so you can remind me of how crazy I get... - Oh, mission accomplished! ...when you make me apologize to you! You're crazy with your fucking Indian pepper bullshit! Hey! I'm working on our fucking lawn for our son! - What? - But of course I'm the crazy one! And of course you have no fucking responsibility - at all in this fight! - You know what, just go fuck one of your raccoons! More likely than fucking you! Hi, Jeffrey. Fancy meeting you here. Uh, here's for your cleaning service. Thank you. Oh, your timing's impeccable. I have a surprise for you, come on in. I'd love to come in, but I've gotta get to work. Come on in. I won't bite. Now just wait here, just a sec. OK. I found these really great blueberries at the farmer's market the other day and it inspired me to do some baking. So... I hope you like pies. Oh, you didn't have to do that. Well, the blueberries were so beautiful, I had to do something with them. Did you know they're a superfood? And, and the crust is gluten-free which means I didn't use flour. I used spelt. By the way... ...I'm sleeping so much better, thanks to your magic little pills. Oh, that's good to hear. And Jeff, you haven't seen my Matthew wandering around the neighborhood, have you? - Uh... - My cat. - Your cat? - He didn't come home last night, but you know how cats are, nine lives and all. Actually, I was thinking about buying a miniature camera and attaching it to his collar to see where he skulks around to. - Oh, that's, uh, an idea. - Yeah. Thank you. Hey, babe. Thanks for writing. I really would love to get together with you one of these days for a, uh, a rubdown. Hope to see you soon. And if we do get together, don't forget to bring your friend... ...Mary Jane. You're sweating. Well, I walked here. I tried to get here as fast as I could. Is everything all right? What's goin' on? Yeah, just needed to talk to a friend and have a drink. - You want one? - Of course. Have I ever said no to that question after twelve? So what are we talkin' about here? We are talking about... ...infidelity. I believe you have some experience with that. Uh, yes, I do. Uh, is Mister Virgin Mary being unfaithful? No. Not unfaithful. - Not technically. - Oh. But I have been emailing with girls on the internet. Girls on the internet. OK, what, what kind of girls on the internet? Sensual massage therapists. Oh, you mean whores? I guess. OK, well, I think that sleeping with a prostitute "technically" counts as being unfaithful. No, no, I am not sleeping with them, that's the point. I just get off on flirting with them online. I don't go through with it. Though truthfully, I do think about it. When was the last time you and Nealy had sex? Oh, uh... - ...it was make-up sex. - Really? Yeah. Do you wanna hear about it? - Yes, of course. - OK. Uh, well, I was fuckin' around online, you know, looking up porn, checking out my internet chicks, my net whores. - Oh, God, I never learn. - No, you don't. All right, all right. Anyway, a few hours later, I get a call from Nealy. - She's read all my emails. - No! Yeah. Suffice to say, she is not too pleased. Of course, I can't leave to go talk to her in person. My patient's labor's going on all night, so the next morning, I have some flowers delivered to her store with a very cheesy love poem. But when I finally get home, she's still at her shop, so I go for a run to clear my head and I decide to make a whole romantic dinner for her. It was going great. It seems like we were really communicating until she just gets weird. She gets really emotional, really serious, and then she says something like, "I think about going out and fucking other people, too." I don't know, it was so weird. It just gets weird. She turns and she runs off and we end up doing it. You know, having sex, and that was like, uh... six months ago. Huh. Well, don't laugh. Why not? It's funny, right? - Maybe to you. - It's hilarious. But who am I to laugh? I think it's been like a year since Pete and I fucked. Wow. This place is depressing. What do you, what do you say we order a couple more and take 'em to go? Go, go, go, go! Do you think the bartender's on to us? We have to make a quick getaway. No, no, no, not with open alcohol. Come on, let's walk around a bit. - It's a nice day. - OK, OK. All right. So what happened with your raccoons? They still driving you crazy? Yes. In fact, I was thinking about buying a gun and camping out - on my roof to shoot them. - Oh, Pete has a gun. - You could just borrow it. - Are you serious, he has a gun? I swear to God, you could blow your varmints to smithereens! - Oh, wow. - Yeah. Mind if I get inside? No, just don't tell him. It's his precious. Yeah, of course it is. - Is it loaded? - Yeah. No. I double checked. You know, I have never held a gun before. Really? Do you feel macho? Oh, yeah. Like Magnum, P.I. What do you say, for old times sake? The life of a psychotherapist. - So lucky. - Am I lucky? Uh, if you get called into your office for an emergency, all you have to do is talk to one of your patients. I think we went through all of medical school high. Maybe we did. I just can't seem to remember. When the net chicks say they're 420-friendly, that's when they really get me. Really? Yeah. I used to love screwing while stoned. I found it to be very freeing. Unfortunately for me, since Nealy got pregnant, just the idea of marijuana makes her paranoid.

No. - I, I, I, I have an idea. - What, what, what? I have an idea. What? What? I think that you should take this home... ...and smoke it. Listen to me. I think you should climb in bed... OK, take this, and lay some pipe. Sounds like a great idea, but that will not happen. - Why not? - Oh. Just the smell of it, just, just the smell... ...it just makes her uptight. So smoke it outside.

Give Mommy a big hug and kiss and say, "I love you. Brought you breakfast. Surprise!" OK? Now, now, now! Hello. Hello, good morning. Breakfast in bed? Wow. Thank you. Thank you. - Mmm! - I'm the luckiest girl in the world. You can eat the breakfast if you want. I can? Do you wanna have some, too? Yeah. Yeah? You want a blueberry? I already had one. Hey, can I smell this flower? Absolutely. Hey, Link! Hey, Doc. What the heck you doing here? - Lookin' for you. - Seriously? I want to talk to you about something. You came all the way out to the mineral plant to talk to me? I had the day off. It's a short drive. Well, it's good to see you. Well, I hope you won't be offended by what I'm about to say. I don't know. What are you about to say? Well, look, I took the liberty of contacting a friend of a friend who runs a middle school. It's a good school with a serious athletic program. Turns out a coach over there is leaving and they'd love to interview you if you're interested. I hope that's not insulting. Oh, no, Doc. I'm... touched. Mind if I ask you why you're doing this for me? I just... I guess I just felt like it. Here, um... Here's the coach's name and number. He's expecting your call. My number's on there too, just in case. Thanks, Doc. Dr. Lang! Dr. Lang! Dr. Lang! Dr. Lang! Dr. Lang! Doc... Doc... Dr. Lang! Dr. Lang! Dr. Lang! I think you left this in my car. Pete, you wanna go in... Eh! There's nothin' to talk about. Becca's already spilled the beans. I taught you how to make pesto, for God's sakes. You sleep with my wife?! I can't talk about this here... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Rebecca, it's Jeff. It's urgent. Please call me back. Hey, there. I'm sorry you had to see that back in my office. I'm not sure what you actually overheard. May I ask what you were doin' there? I need to show you something. What is it? Oh, my God. Oh, no, no. Is there anything I can do for you? Sing with me? - Sing? - Sing with me? # Day is done # # Gone the sun # # Sun # Aww. # From the lakes # # From the hills # # From the sky # Oh, God, no. Oh, God, no! No! No! Oh, my God. Why? Why? Ohh... no. He was so wonderful. All he wanted to do was play. I could really use a hug. It's OK. It's OK. There you go. Jeffrey? Do you know Sonya Fitzpatrick? - No. - She's a pet medium on TV, but she has a private practice. And when my first Yorkie, Max, died, she gave me a lot of comfort. So... so when... ...when I finally found Matthew's body... ...wedged like, like a piece of debris... between the recycle bin and the garbage, I called her, and do you know what she said? What? As he was dying... ...in excruciating pain... ...he was wondering where I was. Well, he's, he's at peace now. Maybe. Maybe he's lost in the dark swirling abyss of nothingness. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry, Lila. Of course you are. Of course you're sorry. Because you poisoned him trying to kill your raccoons. It's OK. I know you weren't trying to hurt him. You were trying to make it... ...nice and pretty for your family in the backyard. I bet Mrs. Nealy Lang was... I bet she was really upset that her sod was all messed up. I bet... I bet she put a lot of pressure on you... ...to fix it. Can I tell you a secret? - Open. - No. Please. I am sorry for your loss, but I am your neighbor and I'm a married man, Lila. You forgot to mention that I disgust you. No. No... Oh, don't lie to me, just say it. - That's not it. - Oh, "married man"? "Married man"? Please. You're a dirty philanderer. You're stupid, too. What, you're just leaving clues around for somebody to find. Careless! Do you want to be caught? Maybe you should. Maybe you should get caught. Maybe I should go out on the street and I should scream it for the world to hear that Dr. Jeffrey Lang is a cheating, cat-killing liar! You know, it's against the law to kill wildlife in this state! Statute ten-dash-thirteen twenty-six. You could do six months in jail. And I don't know, I don't know. I don't know what to do here. I'm feeling very... ...swimmy... ...swimmy with death and saw dust and... ...power hammers in the middle of the night. We didn't do any construction in the middle of the night. Well, how would I know when you gave me those bizarre pills that doped me? Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout at you. I just... I'm very upset about Matthew. Of course you are. The main thing is... I wanna somehow find a way to try to make it up to you. So in a few days, when you've had a chance to mourn, we can get coffee and discuss it. - I'd like that. - Good. - I'd really like that. - Good. OK, great. Now... - Dr. Lang? - Yeah? I had a really funny dream a few nights ago. You and I, we lived in the countryside. In England. And we rode horses everywhere. And mine was a... Oh, he was a big white stallion with a silvery mane. And yours was a beautiful Arabian. And we were in the forest... ...and the light was dim, and we were galloping past each other, we were passing each other by when we both... ...we made our animals stop. I mean, I know you could say it was just a dream but it... What happened next felt... It felt very real to me. And... if you would like me to show you what I did... You, you don't, you don't even have to agree, just... just don't disagree. And then it will be like... ...you're not doing anything at all. I wouldn't want you to get in trouble. aHruaia Oh, God. Oh, my God. Yeah, that... - Wait. - Hmm? Don't stop. I feel you... getting bigger. Wait... No, no, I want you in me. No, no, no, no, no, no. Please! Lila! Inside of me! Oh, fuck. Ready? - Look! Who's that? - Hey. - Daddy's home. - Hey, buddy. Yeah! Very cute. Peter Mazzoni stopped by the house today. Peter Mazzoni stopped by the house? Yeah. He said you guys were working on some deal together? Right, yeah. Uh... ...he wants me to invest in a new restaurant of his. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah. Wow, well, everything that guy touches turns to gold. Maybe we should consider it. Yeah, maybe. Friend here to see you. All right, thanks, Jen. I'll be with you in a minute, Jeff. Have a seat. So... Afternoon. I heard you stopped by my house. Yeah. There's no restraining order on me yet, is there? - What do you want? - What do I want? I wanna fuck your wife up the ass while your two year old watches me hack you into bits. That's what I want. I've decided not to do it. OK. Instead, I'm gonna offer you a choice. You pick up this phone, right now, you call your wife and you tell her what you did or... ...or you give me a hundred thousand dollars in cash for my silence. Hey. - Thanks for meeting me. - Of course. So am I fucked? What do you think? I think he's a... ...an Italian guy from New Jersey who likes to back up his threats. So... Did you end up meeting with Pete today or what? - Yeah. - Yeah? And? What's the matter? I hope I didn't keep you waitin' too long. I got a little lost on the way. No problem. So... I'm sorry, I couldn't get it all. We haven't saved much since we bought our house but I was able to get seventy-five thousand out of our home equity line. Why in the world did you just do that? You ever hear the old saying, "You pays your money and you takes your choice"? No. Well, now you have. By the way, Becca and I are done, so feel free to go take advantage and poke around that cumhole all you want 'cause I don't care anymore. I gave you a choice. I gave you a choice, Jeffrey. You could've told your wife the truth instead of meetin' me here. You could've been a good guy, but no, you're a rat, just like my wife. You're a little punk rat, a boy man rat. Look at you. Just look at you. And you deserve a lot worse than losing some petty cash to the Skagit River. You know, when I discovered what you did, I was gonna kill you. But then I remembered I'm not that kind of man. I'm the kind of man who makes a mistake and then makes amends. I'm the kind of man who got into a drunk driving accident and nearly killed a kid, but did I get some fancy-pants lawyer to get me off scot-free 'cause I was just below the legal limit? Uh-uh! I prayed for forgiveness, and I pled guilty. And when the judge ordered me to pay a million dollars to the kid's family and he sent me to jail for a month, did I stop there? No. I started helping people. Volunteering. Philanthropy. 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am. You may wish you're that kinda man, but you're not. You're a scumbag home-wrecker. You wrecked my home, Jeffrey. You wrecked my home. And I could just as easily wreck yours with one phone call. But I don't need to do that. Because you're the kinda guy who's gonna fuck it all up himself. Hey, Lincoln, how are you? Very good, very good. So guess what? I got the job, Doc. No kidding, that's great news. Actually, I start tomorrow. And to celebrate, this weekend my wife and I were thinking we could have you and your family over to dinner. What's that noise, Lincoln? Oh, I'm all tied up to my dialysis machine right now. Damn thing starts makin' noises for no good reason sometimes. Hello? Hello? Thanks for visiting me, Doc. Nobody ever visits me here. Of course. So I hope you don't mind me askin', I was just wondering what your doctor says in terms of, uh, how long it is before your kidneys fail? A couple years, if I'm lucky. So they say. But I'm feeling strong, and the way I see it, if God can create the earth in seven days, why can't I get lucky and find myself a kidney in the next year or two? Hey, Doc. I hope I didn't depress you with that. Today's a really good day. I know, yeah, yeah, of course. - To Doc. - To Doc. A saint. Oh, not a saint. Well, in my book you are. And one heck of a basketball player. Oh, now are you just saying that - to make him feel good? - Well, let me tell you, if your husband understood how to play defense, had a better jump shot, and was about six foot nine, he'd be killin' 'em in the NBA right now. Hey, hey, you mind if I say a prayer before we eat? Of course not. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for the food that's been prepared before us, for the nourishment and strengthening of our bodies. In the name of Christ Jesus, amen. Amen. - All right, you guys can eat. - Whoo. May I have the salt and pepper? So you haven't told me how the team is yet. Doc, these girls hustle like you wouldn't believe. And there's some talent on the team, too. Oh, that's great. Really great. But I've gotta tell you, what I like the best about it is my kids are finally excited about something their daddy does. Thank you, Doc. You made this possible, bro. You changed my life, Doc. So why can't Angela donate? Oh, she has some kind of congenital heart defect, which means an operation would be risky. He seems so alive, you know, and healthy. He's so far down on the list to get a transplant it's not funny. I know it's kind of an absurd thought, but... ...why shouldn't it be me? Here, I've been doing a little research. "Living organ donation." Wow. OK, you're serious. You've been thinking about this for a while. Well, a bit. This is... This is amazing. I'm just, I'm, I'm worried, uh, what if Miles needs your kidney one day? Well, I thought that we could do a test to make sure both you and Miles have healthy kidneys, and if so, the risk is incredibly small. I'm not opposed to doing some tests. I actually think it's a really wonderful thought to do something truly selfless. You weren't expecting this. All right, there you go, there you go. OK, pick up the rhythm, guys. All right, good, good. Right back to the other side. Lincoln. Hey, Doc. What are you doin' here? How's it goin'? It's goin' great. The girls are great. Yeah. Uh, I come bearing some good news. You know I like good news. After dinner at your house, my wife and I were talking about your, your health situation. And um, long story short, the last few weeks have been all about kidney donation and we have researched it, talked about it, done a bunch of tests, and we came to agree that it was the right thing to do. So I called your doctor and... Whoa, wait a minute. Are you saying what I think you're sayin'? We are a perfect match, Lincoln. The same blood type, everything. Doc, yes! - Ahhh! - Ahhh! Man, what am I lookin' at? Am I looking at a man or an angel? Ladies, ladies, hold up, hold up. This is my friend, Dr. Lang. And he's gonna give me one of his kidneys! I'm gonna live! Uh, um, take a break guys. Oh, man. Wow, man. Wow, man. - Scalpel. - Scalpel. - Sponge. - Sponge. Clamp. Clamp. Ligature. Scissors. There's your daddy. Shh, shh, shh. I don't know if he's awake. I'm sorry. Hey. Hey, little guy. What's up? - Hey, hey, Doc. - Hey. I'm good, thanks. All right, sir. Oh. My heart is warm. I got so much love for you right now, Doc. Gimme your hands. I'm so glad this worked out, Lincoln. So am I, Doc. So am I. Oh. My minister came by to visit me this morning. And we were talking about what a miracle it is, what you did, and he had the idea to do a special service in your honor. I don't need to be honored. Wouldn't be for your vanity, Doc. It'd be for our congregation, to inspire them to do their own charity work. I think it would be, you know, painless. But if you'd prefer not to... No. I'll do it. Sounds like a good idea. It is. Aloha. I brought you this basil plant. These hospitals are so toxic. So many germs. Thank you. So... ...how'd you know to find me here? You're in the paper. What, didn't you know? What a wonderful thing you did for him, saving his life, getting him the job, everything. No doubt... you will reap the positive karma of this for a long time. Um... speaking of karma, there's something I need to tell you, which may slam the karmic wheel of fate down on me hard. Um... I know I shouldn't have done it... but after Matthew was poisoned and before our... ...you know... ...I was seeing red and I called the Department of Building and Safety and told them about your construction. Anyway, they finally came by yesterday and they... they put this on your door. I am really sorry, Jeffrey. I, I... ...probably would've done the same thing if you'd killed my pet. There's something else. I'm pregnant. With your baby. I know what you're thinking. But you don't need to be worried. It's all gonna be all right. It will all work out. Things always do. No. Things don't always work out. You want me to kill it, don't you? I wanna go in the house. We're goin'. OK. I thought about fixing it myself, but it just didn't seem worth it. Don't worry, it's decaf. I, I would never poison our baby with a double shot of real espresso. They say it can cause autism. Then again, you're the baby doctor. Hey, can I ask, um... Are you one hundred percent certain that you're pregnant? Yes. I took the test twice, I peed twice, - just to make sure. - Lila... Do you really think, in your heart, that this is the right thing to do, for you and I to be having a baby together? Oh... absolutely. It's a miracle. - No. - Yes, Jeff. I feel the life growing inside of me. - No, Lila, - I can feel it - blooming - Lila, please. - and blossoming and growing. - Lila, please. Lila. Look... Lila! What fuckin' planet do you live on?! There is no way, no chance under any circumstance, that I'll be fathering a child with you. Jeffrey, I want you to understand that once our little one is born I'm not expecting child support or anything like that. I just want our little one to grow up knowing his father. And if you think about it, it's perfect. The little one will be right next door. You can come by and visit any time you like. You can be like the charming uncle and that... that wife of yours never has to find out. She won't know. Bye. See you later. I... I don't have any medical insurance so I thought maybe you could help me out. You wouldn't put anything up there that would hurt the baby, would you? No. I wouldn't do that. Does that mean...? It's alive. Dang, Doc. That's a pretty tight spot this woman's got you in. You know, Doc, my mother used to say, "It's impossible to reason with an unreasonable person." I think that's what you're dealing with, with this woman here. I can barely see straight. And the things I'm thinking, you, you couldn't imagine. Like what? Like all day... ...I'm fantasizing about her dying. I must've imagined it a hundred different ways. Actually, last night, I had a dream about it. A wish fulfillment dream, huh, Doc? I guess so. What was it? It was ridiculous. There were these two football players runnin' through the woods in the park by my house where I sometimes go jogging and I see her walking her little dog every night at dusk. They're just galloping through the woods in full game day uniforms. One of 'em hurls a ball through the air. As it sails, I realize it's an arrow. It splits her head wide open. I woke up totally relieved. Until I realized it was just a dream. Sick, huh? It's gonna be all right, Doc. It's gonna be all right. Meredith just called and said that Peter and Rebecca are getting divorced. "Once upon a time, but not long ago, a mom and her girl were folding washed clothes. When suddenly, Mom noticed something amiss. Something weird, something crazy, a real mystery this! 'Where are the socks?' asked Mom with a frown. 'I can't find them up. - I can't find them down.'" - Hey. Hey. Have you seen my keys anywhere? No, I have no idea. Uh, have you looked in your purse? Yes, of course I looked in my purse. You didn't take them with you when you left the house this morning, did you? No. What about Miles' toy box? Remember when he hid the remote in there? Oh! Oh, please, please. I, I have a... Please don't do it. Please. Please. Hello? - Jeff. - Hey, honey. So I come home for lunch today to find out that our whackadoodle neighbor got herself shot dead with a bow and arrow. It happened in the park. Less than a mile away. The police are now going door to door. Sort of puts a damper on tonight's celebration, doesn't it? Thank you, Jesus! Thank you. That's a plane, you know what that is. No, that. Oh, that? I don't know what that is. That was pretty moving, huh? Where, where are we going? Hey. I cheated my way through med school. What? Cheat sheets. Very elaborate, written on little pieces of paper in every pocket. When I was a kid, I had this doctor who misdiagnosed my chicken pox as dermatitis. I almost died. Did I ever tell you that? No. While I was in the hospital, my mother and grandmother were sitting around, I overheard my grandmother say, "Well, I guess not all doctors made A's." Turns out, I became one of those doctors. I am a "study at the last minute, slide-by, path of least resistance... ...fuckhead, C-plus" doctor. You're a great doctor. Look. No... Jeff! What are you doing?! Jeff, stop! Don't! Don't! Stop the car! Oh, my God! Stop it! Stop! No! You are freaking me out. What is going on? I fucked Rebecca. What? I don't mean to hurt you telling you this. I'm just trying to tell you the truth for a change. Rebecca Mazzoni. - I only fucked her once. - Oh, great. Good. But Peter found out. In the meantime... ...I accidentally... ...poisoned Lila's cat trying to get the raccoons. All in the same day. She followed me to work to confront me about Matthew... ...that's her cat... ...and Peter shows up to confront me about Rebecca. And Lila takes off without saying a word, so when I go to see what she wanted... ...she comes on to me. - And she goes absolutely fucking ballistic. - Oh, my God. - Threatens to tell you everything and... - Oh, my God. ...I guess a part of me wanted to have sex with her because I did. Wow. Wow. Nealy... ...uh... ...so far this has been the good news. She, uh... ...she got pregnant. Who got pregnant? Lila. Oh, God. What? The chances of it happening that one time at her age are... I... What? But here comes the kicker. I didn't know who to confide in. So I visited... ...Lincoln. We're sitting there... ...and I mention to him a dream I had... ...where Lila's killed with an arrow. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Nealy, I was just venting to him. Oh, my God, Jeff. - I didn't ask him to do it. - Oh, my God. But he did it. This is real? This really fucking happened? Oh, my God, Jeff! Jesus! Jesus! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I don't know why I'm laughing. I don't know. Don't fucking come near me. I fucked somebody, too. Before that, that big fight we had about the raccoons. Those stupid raccoons. I was fucking somebody. I was having an affair for months. Six months. He was a customer. I helped him pick out fabric. It was blue corduroy. He worked at the wine shop down the street. He'd bring me plates of cheese and salami. It's over now. OK. OK. Yeah. Yeah, OK. I deserve whatever I get. What do you think you deserve? Probably for a piano to fall from the sky and crush me. Prison. You leave me. Maybe lose my son. I don't know. I fucking killed somebody. I'm responsible. I'm responsible. Look what I did to this fuckin' thing. Do you still love me? Yes. I mean... ...I don't understand. After everything I've done... I was such an idiot. I've lied and cheated. Yes. Yes, I love you. I don't know what to do. I, uh... Tell me what to do. Let's go. - Hi. - Hello. Did you have a nice time? How's, uh, how's Miles? Miles is very asleep. - Good news. - Thank you. Good night. What now? Turn myself in? Turn Lincoln in? Uh, I don't want to ruin the life we've built together, Jeff. I don't wanna... ...hurt everyone, destroy everything. What does that mean? If we turn him in... ...his kids grow up without a father and Angela's a single mom. And Miles grows up with this... ...cloud of murder and weirdness over his head, and that's the best case scenario. The worst case scenario is... ...a jury doesn't believe your side of the story and you go to prison, too. You think we're gonna be laying in bed with insomnia talking about this when we're eighty years old? I think we're gonna be talking about this for a long time. We'll talk about it and talk about it... ...until one day... ...we'll decide not to. And then we'll worry silently for years. Maybe we won't make it. Maybe we'll implode with guilt. Maybe that's what should happen. Or maybe we'll make it through. And eventually... ...this will fade away... ...and it'll seem like a dream we had. It was true. Everything that had happened would eventually become a distant memory. However, before that occurred, I'd find myself going to this police station... ...thinking I should probably walk in and come clean. Thinking if I didn't, then... ...then I probably deserved whatever the worst was that the universe could deal me. But... in the end... ...in reality... ...I'd just get up off that bench and go home. And at night, with our grass gone, the raccoons kept their distance. No one got caught and no one was the wiser. And life just... ...went on. aHruaia # Take one fresh and tender kiss # # Add one stolen night of bliss # # One girl, One boy # # Some grief, Some joy # # Memories are made of this # # Don't forget a small moonbeam # # Fold in lightly with a dream # # Your lips and mine # # Two sips of wine # # Memories are made of this # # Then add the wedding bells # # One house where lovers dwell # # Three little kids # # For the flavor # # Stir carefully through the days # # See how the flavor stays # # These are the dreams you will savor # # With his blessings from above # # Serve it generously with love # # One man, one wife # # One love through life # # Memories are made of this # # Memories are made of this #
