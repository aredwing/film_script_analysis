She's waking up. Sit down. Guess might as well. Did you work hard? Same as always. Hey, why are you always crying? Come to your daddy. Come to your papa. Now you'll stop crying. Hush. Hush now. Hush! You take her. She doesn't love her daddy. She doesn't love her daddy. Talk to me. You okay now? Slow down, Indio. - She's hungry. - There you go. Just look at her. Little crybaby. She's hungry. Mommy doesn't feed you. Shall put this on her? Don't suck so hard. Easy. So you don't get cold. Go on, have all you want. Didn't you feed her earlier? Sure, but she's always hungry. Now she's done. Come here. Go with Daddy now. I'm thinking of crossing the border and going north. What do you think? It's hard to earn much here. They're laying people off. If go, I'll stay a year. We can't make ends meet here. She'll have to go to school. She'll need clothes and all that. I'd rather you didn't go, but guess... whatever you want. In six months I'll make enough to come back home. That should be enough. Then we won't have to eat so many potatoes. That'd be a nice change. Dear Virgin of Guadalupe, who appeared here below, ease, dearest Mother, all my sorrow and woe. You're going off just like your father Alberto did. And he never came back. Don't go, son. Please. Don't worry, Mama. I'll make lots of money in the U.. Give me a little smile. You can do better than that. That woman! Come on! I'm a poor little deer who lives in the hills I'm not very tame, so don'! come down in daylight come down at night Straight into your arms, my love climbed the highest hill to look out over the plains Hawks don't rule where eagles soar Neither does la migra with its chickenshit airplanes Stand up and proceed downhill. There are officers waiting at the bottom. Come out and walk toward them. Don't run! Stand up and don'! run. We can see you. Officers are waiting below. We see you down there in the bushes. Don't run. What? What's goin' on? Who is this guy? - I'm just passing through. - thought you were Immigration. - Are the tortillas ready? - In a minute. - And coffee? - You want coffee now? Of course. Look what turned up out of the blue. Scared the heck out of us. We thought he was Immigration. - How about a tortilla? - Sure. Here are the beans. Dig in. Help yourself. He's one of us. There's a few of us. We just sleep in different places so if Immigration comes, they won't catch us all at once. Bring it closer. Don't be embarrassed. We're all friends here. Dig in, guys. We gotta get going. You think there's a chance could get work here? Sure, someone will hire you. Just don't ask questions. Tell the boss you're just here to work. Don't ask questions. That's all. So you want to work here? - Hey, the beans will burn. - No, they won't. - Take 'em off now. - They're good, huh? - Where are you from? - Michoacan. - Lots of michoacanos here. - What about you guys? I'm from Guanajuato. - What about you? - Guadalajara. And you? Zacatecas. We're from all over the place. Puebla. Everywhere. All over the place. When did you cross the border? Yesterday? Where's the sugar? What kind of work is there around here? Picking tomatoes. Want a chile? - Sure. Seems a little rotten. Watch out for Immigration as you come out. They're around a lot now. Yeah, you'll get work. Just stick with us. We'll teach you everything. Move it, man. You're falling behind. It's la migra, boys! Let's go! Run! How'd it go? They cleaned us out again early in the day. That one's sharp. He got away. See you tomorrow. Hey, what about my pay? You're the one who hired me. Hey, you hired me! You hired me! You're the one who hired me! You want work? Like this. This is a good size for the baskets. - What about this one? - That's good too. - Okay to turn 'em over? - Yes. That's the size. Can you make money here? Don't let 'em see you. Watch, like this. Where you headed when you're done here? When I'm done here? don't know. Don't know these parts. Have one if you're hungry. The man's right there. Look. Watch this. Don't be scared. - The black dog came after me. - Their black dog? You can make good money here. - That's what came for. Here's where we'll stay.

Tortillas and beans, right? Here in the U.. you ask for ham, eggs, and coffee. Now you do it, and look confident. Just once, so you can learn. Go on! Don't be scared. Give it your best. This is the coffee shop, and you walk in. I'm the waitress. Berto's the waitress. You come in and sit down. Smile and look confident. And now you order... And if the waitress is pretty, talk to her. Give her a little kiss. But I'm married. That's in Mexico. Here you gotta act like the people here. Here we're all unattached. Got that? But I'm married. Beer! What's your name? - Tavo.

Out the back! Illegals! Anyone without papers! Out the back! Stand against the wall. Any matches or cigarettes? What's your name? Roberto what? Ramirez. Good-b ye, California They're taking me away But'll always carry you with me God willing, I'll return very soon I'm leaving my experiences behind will return Dear Lord, grant me this much Let me have your attention, men. Please. You all know... it costs $200 to get to the U.. to find work. Right? Well, you bums got lucky. You won't have to pay a single peso. If you're hard workers and are really looking to work, can take you there, and it won't cost you a peso. Why would do this? Because like you so much? You're all smart guys, right? can't fool you. The thing is, there's a strike going on in Colorado, and they need men like you to pick melons. So if you want, you can go now and pay later. The $200 will come out of your pay. But that won't be a problem. Listen, just got back from Colorado. They're paying better than in California. So how many are interested? Come on. Have a beer on me after you sign up. Want to go too. I'm a hard worker, and have a daughter. Let me finish with the men first. Then I'll see what can do, okay? Don't worry. It's just on the other side, see? The worst is over. Tomorrow morning a truck will pick you up and take you to Colorado, where you'll make good money. So relax for now, and by tomorrow... you'll be making good money. Get up. Come on. Get up. On your feet. The food's here. Alberto! Ramirez! That's my dad! This is where your father lived. It's not much. A broken-down bus. - They always live like this? - Sometimes, man.

He was sick, poor guy. A postcard. What's this? A letter. That's not my mother. He was married here to... Look, this is a $50 money order from Alberto Ramirez to Mrs. Grace Ramirez. That was her name. They don't live far from here. Can take you there if you'd like. It's just a few hours. Don't like this food. Don't like this food. Wanna go home! Wanna go home!

Is my baby all right? Let me see him. Lift him up so she can see him. My son. He's a little man. He was born here. My son will have papers. He can work here, back and forth. Yes, he was born here, sweetie. Went up north as an alambrista Not knowing what to expect Back on the farm left behind My daughter, my wife, and my poor mother One night, like a little deer crossed over from Tijuana to San Diego La migra caught almost all of us God knows how got away don't know how did it, but here am to tell the tale... In the fields met other pollos Who taught me all the ropes Like how to order ham and eggs in English with a smile Beta and Joe taught me that Joe was a good friend to me And took me with him to Stockton Hanging on for dear life beneath a train Poor Joe met his fate on those tracks was lost on the streets of Stockton When a waitress defended me from attack And almost stayed with Sharon Who shared her house and her affection with me picked grapes and cucumbers And sent money back home to my wife But la migra nabbed me at a dance And landed back in Tijuana Like the wind beneath a starry sky Me and some others crossed the desert A gringo rancher had hired us And a coyote took us to Colorado Beneath a sun the color of copper and blood worked as a scab ask the Virgin '5 forgiveness For any harm caused others There came across my father His heart ca I've out night in the fields He never knew was at his side The son he'd abandoned Little dove flying home to my land I'm flying night behind you I'm going back to see my family And lay my heart at their feet
