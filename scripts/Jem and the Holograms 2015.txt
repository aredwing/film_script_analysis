Everyone has a secret identity. Versions of ourselves that we create to be shared and liked and followed. Why else would Facebook give everyone a wall? Because after you make your life look perfect, you need something to hide behind. Okay. Much better. So now you know my real secret identity. But with all the identities we have access to online, there's always been one question I haven't been quite able to answer. Which one's the real you? Now I know that sounds like something I got off a poster in my guidance counselor's office, but that doesn't change the fact that it's the truth. Which is what, I, Jerrica Benton, am here to confess to you, my closest friend, the Internet. I just really never expected things to get so out of hand. Especially because less than one month ago, at the beginning of the summer, nobody even knew I existed. I was living the most unexceptional life in the least likely place imaginable... Pineview, California. Okay. Here comes the truth. Hello, welcome to Kimbercam. So 10 years ago, when I was eight, I moved here from Los Angeles with my little sister, Kimber. Now you know how some people go online and over share every tiny, little detail of their lives? - Well, Kimber basically invented that. - Ta-da. Her life is just an open e-book for everyone to see, not that they want to or not. - I'm waiting. - Since we live with our Aunt Bailey, that means we also get to live with her two foster daughters. There's Shana, who is a fashionista who thinks way outside the box. And Aja, who's a part-time genius, full-time badass. Girls, come down and meet your sisters. Aunt Bailey took us in 10 years ago when Kimber and I had nowhere else to go. And the five of us have been a family ever since. Now there's only one missing piece, and it's a big one. My dad, Emmett. He would call me his diamond in the rough, or his Jem. All right, so what I'm trying to do right now is fix this circuit, which is giving me lots of problems. But try and try again, so... He was an inventor, a dreamer, always working on his greatest creation. 5-1-N-3-R-G-Y. Or what he'd call "Synergy." Even though his philosophy was to always finish what you've started, um, he passed away before he got to complete this one. I can't even get the thing to turn on, but for now, I keep it on my shelf so I still feel like he's with me. Here she is, in her native habitat. - No! Kimber, not now. - An eager, free-spirited artist ready... - to share her songs with the world! - Seriously, stop it! Can I not have five seconds of privacy? - You know I don't like it when you sneak up on me. - Cool it, J. I come in peace. Two things. First of all, your hair is a total mess. - As always. - It's supposed to be like that. Hanging in front of your face? Literally poking you in the eyeballs? Everyone wears it like this. Trust me, it's cool. Okay. Well, this is better. Look, I can see you. There you are. Okay, whatever. What's the second thing? I don't like being on camera. - Get out! Get out! - Stop! Now, I know what you're thinking. This many girls under one roof, recipe for disaster, right? Well, if you're thinking that, that's sexist, and you should be ashamed of yourself. Because we actually get along really well. We're a family. - Calm down! - No! I'm not going to calm down! - I spent my own money on this! - I need you to listen. - Hello! Anybody? - What? - What's happening? - I was just trying to help out our little Kimber, and the next thing I know she's going all Katniss on me. Look what she did to my favorite skirt. She turned it into a denim napkin. Denim napkin's actually a really good idea. - I'm so tired of you, Shana! - Oh! Don't call me. - But I love you. - Hey, so, if anyone asks I was here all morning. - We thought you were. - Exactly. Look, I'm just tired of you improving my clothes, okay? I don't want to look like a fashion refugee from 1985. - I think it's fine. - I'm glad you think that, Aja, - because she did the same exact thing to your favorite dress. - Surprise. Do you remember what Dr. Kessler said about breathing before we react? I love it! This would look way better. - Why would you do that? - What the hell are you doing? - Shana, you can't take clothes and do this to people. - I'm making everyone... - Five minutes of peace and quiet. - Hey, hey! - I'm trying to focus. - Whoa! God! Kimber, hit a C note. - Seriously, Aunt Bailey? - Yeah, seriously. Let's go. Very nice. Kimber, you were a little flat. What? Shana, you were a little sharp. I would love nothing more than to get you all a new wardrobe, but the store's not doing great. See, that's what I'm talking about. Money's tight until we sell the house, and I'm just trying to make the most of what we've got. And I know that I messed up and I'm sorry. Okay? - Come here. - Oh, my God. If you want to hug something, can you hug one of those grocery bags? Weirdest family ever. While we're coming clean, I might've possibly borrowed these without asking you. The earrings my dad gave me? I have a problem. Sorry. My room is locked. Yeah, but not in any serious way. Let's go! Or I'm going to make you sing again. - Wait, you guys. Guys, I just had the greatest idea. - A music video? Yeah. Shana and Aja, we can do that song we've been working on. And Jerrica, if you want, you can back me up on vocals. - I'm in. - Sweet. I'm just going to stay here and help Aunt Bailey. Come on! It'll be fun. - Just be yourself. - Or not. You're in real luck, because Aunt Bailey's a real hoarder. - Wait. What did you just call me? - A collector. Yeah. That's what I thought you said. We can go to the garage and use all the old clothes in the back, and no one even needs to know it's you. We can get you a disguise. Whoo! Welcome to Aunt Bailey's garage. You and me We can do the red light dance till the morning after Wait and see We can have a 10-night-stand We can bring the rapture Turn me on Light it up wherever we go Rocking dusk till dawn, baby Quentin Tarantino Going all night long in my daddy's El Camino Baby, all you gotta do is call Hit me up We can get together Turn it to 11 Boy, you know you wanna Oh, I want ya No, I can't wait another second - Come on! - Baby, hit me up We can get together Turn it to 11 Boy, you know you wanna Oh, hit me up - You'll wear this one. - Oh! No complaining. Me and you Underneath the diamond sky on a ruby Tuesday Oh, my God! How do I look? Ladies? Truly? Truly, truly? Outrageous. Do the hair flip, no? Okay. Hit me up We can get together Turn it to 11 Boy, you know you wanna, oh Hit me up I can get you hotter High as helicopters Boy, you know you wanna, oh Hit me up All right, J, it's your turn to sing! - Sing? - Yeah. This is your song. You got it. Sing one of your songs. Sing what you feel. Come on. - What? - Yeah. No. I feel uncomfortable. Come on, J. I need you. - Please? - Oh, you know what? I'll do it later. Because I have to answer the doorbell. Put the camera in our room. We'll do it later. Hi. Oh. What... Sorry. She's not going to do it later. - No. - No. Thanks. Bye. Why didn't you tell us? Because I don't want you girls to worry. If we're forced out, doesn't that mean that we could all be separated? You know what? Okay. 30 days, that's what they're giving us. - There has to be something that we can do. - There is. We can be strong for each other, and for your sisters. And don't worry. I'm going to figure this out. - Okay. - Okay? I'm working on an appeal. Everything's gonna be fine. It's funny how realizing that your life might fall apart gives you new perspective. Even though I'd known that inscription by heart since I was a little girl, it felt like I was seeing it for the first time that night. It made me wonder what my dad thought I'd be going through when he wrote it. But really, I just wish that he'd tell me how to get through this now. - Come here. - Just kidding! Aja! Sing one of your songs. Sing what you feel. Come on. What? No. I feel uncomfortable. I need you. My name is Jerrica, and if you keep watching, I'm going to play you a song that I wrote, obviously. Hi. I'm Jerrica. Oh. Oh, hey, I didn't see you there. I'm Jerrica Benton and this is my song. I... I need to cut this. Ohh! Hi. I'm Jem. Maybe I'm alone out here And nobody's listening Maybe I'm the only one My voice is echoing What if I'm wrong And there's a million others just like me No, you're not alone Alone We can be alone together No, you're not alone Alone We can feel alone together And no, you're not alone Alone I can see the flashing lights Oh, but can they see me? Everybody shines so bright I'm in the dark hiding What if I'm wrong and there's a million others just like me? And no, you're not alone Alone We can be alone together And no, you're not alone Alone We can feel alone together And no, you're not alone Hi. I'm Jem. You done? Hey, Kimber. Um, I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to figure this one out for yourself. You didn't record anything? I don't know what you're so scared of, J. But whatever it is, you don't have to be. Besides, I think you look pretty good in your rockin' hair and makeup. Uh, guys, something's happening with the Internet. Just unplug the cable thingy and then plug it back in again. Really, Shana? "The cable thingy"? No, I mean, like, something's happening that you really need to see. Okay. Oh, my gosh! Shana, you have to come here right now. - I don't know how this is happening. - Are you serious right now? - Hurry up. - Every time I refresh it, it just keeps going up. - What? - No way! Click that one. I'm here with Erica Raymond, founder and CEO of recording empire Starlight Enterprises. All the Web's been talking about is this video posted by an artist who only goes by Jem. This Jem video, it's magic. Do you have any advice for an emerging young artist like her? - What's going on? - Absolutely. Jem, if you're out there, check your in-box. - Oh, my God! - Mm-hmm. - Is that me? - Yes! - No! I deleted this. - Jerrica, she's a huge deal. Check your YouTube account. Guys, the Erica Raymond just asked Jem to do three shows in LA. - That is crazy! - Amazing. Look at the money that she's offering. You. Did you do this, Kimber? What the hell? - You know how I feel about these things. - No, this is awesome! We're sisters and we're supposed to help each other. You helped me with the music video, so I helped you overcome your crippling online shyness and boom, win-win. And you're wearing the necklace I designed. 36,000 freakin' people just saw my necklace. - Can you please link that to my Etsy account? - Yeah, what's your log-in? J, don't worry. The video's public, but my account's private. So nobody knows who uploaded it or who's in it. All they know is that she calls herself Jem, and they seriously like her. Actually, they love her! Except that guy. And that one. Scroll down. Ooh, that guy really doesn't like her. Oh, my God! I'm not letting you be upset about this. You're Internet famous. That's the second best thing to being actually famous. Jerrica, she does have a point. You're getting hits like water-skiing squirrel. - I love water-skiing squirrel! - Yes! He's so cute. When they first put him on the thing and then he just balances on the water. - He doesn't even fall off. I can't even do that. - Like, so badly. So badly. You're way more than water-skiing squirrel. J, you can't be upset about this. This doesn't happen every day. The Erica Raymond just direct-messaged us. I always knew you'd go viral. - That just sounds gross. - You're gonna be famous! There you go. The version of me that they want doesn't... It doesn't exist, Aunt Bailey. If I go on stage, they're not gonna see this... Jem. They're gonna see this small-town wannabe who writes songs to sing in her shower. I think you're absolutely right. You are no rock star. Right. Yeah. No, that's exactly what I'm saying. I think you have the potential to become something so much greater. Aunt Bailey, just... please, just listen, okay? No, you listen. There are some ideas, some voices that are too special to keep hidden. Those are your father's words. You know, when we were growing up here in this house, our lives were here. But your dad was always talking about what was out there. And as soon as he was old enough, he went out to make it happen. I think you're more like your dad. Maybe your life is out there. It's just that I know that this could really help with the family and the house and... This is not about the house. Okay, this is about you not going your whole life wondering what would have happened if you had taken that chance. Besides, when was the last time you had the chance to go back to LA? Hmm? Think about it. Okay? Yeah! - Morning. - Good morning. You with the band? Something like that. Zipper. No, my name is Zipper, ma'am. - Oh! - You'll have to forgive my associate. He's terrible at first impressions. I Am Cold Blooded Cold-blooded Cold-blooded I'm a cold-blooded woman - Erica Raymond, Starlight Enterprises. - Hi! Bailey. From... my house. It's such an honor to meet you. Thank you. - Would you like to come in? - That's why we're here. Let me see your armory - That knife looks nice and sharp - Girls! Downstairs! Okay, I'll be right there. One second. Miss Raymond, you can make yourself at home. - The girls will be down in a minute. - Great. - Can I get you something to drink? - I would love a water. A water. With ice? Without? - Whatever. Ice. Yeah. - Oh, okay. - Zipper? - Oh, he doesn't need anything. Okay. I hope you didn't hit too much traffic. Oh, it was... it was fine. Oh, my ice maker's broken. That's okay. I don't need ice. Jerrica, let's go! How much stuff do you have? Hurry up! Here you are. So, Miss Raymond, I have to tell you that profile in The Times was so inspiring. You know, as a working woman myself. Thank you. The writer I wasn't sure about, but thank you. Oh, I thought it was really nice. Thank you! - You must be... - Aja. - Shana. - I'm Kimber. Uh, Jerrica. Jerrica Benton. Come over here. Jerrica Benton You are cute and quirky. And no longer Jerrica. - Uh, what do you mean? - What do I mean? What do you mean what do I mean? The whole world wants to know who you are right now. Which means so much free publicity. This is exactly the artist that Starlight has been looking for. Equal parts talent and mystery. Talent, mystery. Which reminds me. Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, all of that, until further notice, none of it. - Thank God! - Wait, what? - She's so awesome. - And the money. You get paid! Who doesn't want money? After the last show, you get a paycheck. But that's not what this is about. I want you all to think of this as an opportunity to reinvent yourselves. Escape. Forget all that dismal mediocrity that you grew up in. Maybe take this moment to decide who... who do you want to be? Who is that person? What does she look like? And reimagine yourself the way you want to be. With a little help, of course. - Okay. Say "hey." - What? Smile! Come on! Shut that thing off. Get in here. - Teasing. I'm teasing. - Get in the car. - Bye, Aunt Bailey! - Here we go! - We love you! - Bye! Bye! And so there we were, headed towards the unknown. Then again, in a way, I was coming home. Back to the place Kimber and I were born... Los Angeles. It had just been a while. Morning, Ms. Raymond. Thank you. - You ready for the big adventure? - Yes. Oh, good. Well, I took the liberty of arranging for some new instruments. - This is love at first sight. - Vipers? Dude, that's sick. How cool is that? And ladies, this is Rio, our college intern. He'll take care of everything you need while you're here, so just go to him. - Hi, girls. - Nice to meet you. First, a couple of ground rules... no drinking, no smoking and absolutely no going out after midnight curfew. I thought rock stars were allowed to do all that stuff. Well, I'll bear that in mind when I meet some. Until then, follow the rules and stay out of trouble. Okay. Let's go. - Weird meeting you. - Likewise. Oh, and, uh, good luck with your style session. This is Starlight Enterprises, the house that Erica built. That means changing the way you act, the way you sound and the way you look. Ladies, I give you Erica Raymond. Thank you, Esteban. Okay. Kimber. Hmm. Not trying enough. Aja. Haven't quite figured you out yet. Oh, no, I got it. You don't try at all. That's awful. Shana. Esteban, are you looking at this? It reminds me of people who dress up their animals. Trying too hard. Jem. My Jem. That's what we call you now. - Interesting... - Thank you. if you live in the Valley. Oh, my God, those boots. I had those in high school, and I got made fun of so much. But I digress. You're gonna have to lose the earrings. They're so last season. - Like 30 years ago. - Oh. Don't worry, we'll hold them for safekeeping. Okay. Thank you. We'll get there. I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, 'cause it's not. It's gonna be challenging and exciting. You're giving us new looks? We already have. "Jem. Uncover the mystery." What? Uncover the mystery. I'm so glad I thought of that. This is us? No, it's Photoshop. But it will become a reality before the first show. Rehearsal starts in 20 minutes on Sunset. The sooner we have a single to leak, the sooner you become the girls in the poster. We're gonna have fun. Lot of hours, though, in the day. Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi Mi, mi, mi, only mi, mi Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi Hush now I mother-rocker Give you complete bliss I got your wow, wow Look at my bottom Give that a kiss I am so super, pupper, drupper I'm the front girl in round I am so cool with my fashion Pink lips Stacking money rolls down Yo, yo, I pull up in Lamba I pull up in my Louboutin I pull up Phone in my hand and ice on my bracelet And all I've got I am so super, pupper, drupper I am the front girl in round I am so cool with my sexy bad hips When I am walking down I am so cool with my awesome big tits on the ground Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi Mi, mi, mi, only mi, mi Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi Mi, mi, mi, sexy mi Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi Mi, mi, mi, only mi, mi Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi Mi, mi, mi, sexy mi Pink.

Cappuccino flyin' in. We'll just keep on practicing. Mrs... Mrs. Raymond, it's a pleasure, always, to see you. I, uh... I was wondering if you listened to my demo yet. I was just thinking about it. Do you have any response to it yet? Uh... So, yeah, I'll bring it around. Bring the car. That happens all the time. So, we'll pick things up tomorrow. In the meantime, I've arranged for your transportation to take you where you're staying. We get to borrow your car? Really? Never! No, your ride is over there. What are you waiting for, Little Miss Pink Hair and the Sing-Alongs? Hop on in. Everything was going so well. Hello, Rio. Does this thing even have seat belts? We just got our hair done too. - Are you... - All right. - Was that necessary? - We are home. He's the worst driver... ever. All right, this is Starlight Mansion. Your room is upstairs. Hey, are these for us? No? Yes? Thank you. I will take this. This is amazing. You can see the Hollywood sign. Stop. What are you doing? - I'll put them back later. - When's later? - Shh. - You have a problem. Duh. This is your room. I'm just down the hall. Call if the place is on fire. Bother housekeeping if there's anything else. And remember, midnight means lights out on your little slumber party. - Any questions? - Nope. Mm-mmm. Perfect. Have a good night, ladies. - Thank you, Rio. - Thank you. Yeah, I actually do have one really quick question. This is my bed. You have to move your stuff. I know that Erica said that this room has, like, a specific name. And I was just wondering if maybe you could help me remember it. - It's the Rock Star Suite. - Oh! The Rock Star Suite. Oh, that's right. Thank you. Um, well, hey, maybe that means you have met some after all. Hmm? Is anyone else so tired they can't even take their shoes off? I'm so tired I can't even try my new ones on. Man. I would have never guessed that coming here would mean a whole new Jerrica. You mean Jem. Right. Jem. Let's be honest, at some point we all wish that we could just become someone else. Leave your old life behind, start over. But the odds of that happening really aren't in your favor. Except... it was happening. And right when I thought everything would be different... the past came rushing back. This is where it gets weird. - Guys. Wake up. - What? You gotta see this. - What is that? - I don't know. - You guys, I gotta get this on camera. - This is not a good idea. We'll just go together. We'll be fine. It's a little after midnight, and we're about to make contact with a mysterious entity. - Kimber! - Aja, it's fine. Shh. - I don't like this. - Aja, relax. Just pull it off quickly before something happens. Okay, okay. One, two... Whoa. Synergy? You brought that broken old thing? Doesn't look broken to me. Look, there's pieces missing. Maybe he left it unfinished on purpose. Pick it up. Be careful. Oh, my God. Wait, he gave that to you, like, a million years ago. Why is it only working now? I don't know. That's the song that Dad used to whistle in the workshop. So that's how it communicates. Through music. - Oh, my God! - Not bad. Show's over, Synergy. What else you got? Oh, my gosh! Welcome to the Synergy operating system. Well, that's different. Next-gen fuel cell, airtight waterproof casing, an HD projector array. This goes way, way beyond different. It looks like some sort of a map. Aja, where does it lead to? Santa Monica Pier. See, those are the latitude and longitude points. Coming into LA, we must have activated a GPS trigger. - Jerrica, is that you? - Yeah. Dad used to take us there. When the waves hit those pipes, they make sounds. Maybe that's where your dad wants us to take Synergy next. - You're right. - Where are you going? He must have wanted us to finish what he never could, right? His greatest creation. I know that look. This is a really bad idea. It's after curfew, we have rehearsal in the morning, and we don't even know if that's what he really wants us to do. Then we're gonna find out. Wait, what about Synergy? - We can take it with us. - Okay. Let this beat work Let this beat ride I be spittin' on flames when the heat risin' God Survive And we could be cookin' pies Behold the passion in my eyes And let this beat ride Work Let this beat ride I be spittin' on flames when the heat risin' God Survive And we could be cookin' pies Behold the passion in my eyes And let this beat Let that beat Let that beat Let that beat Let that beat Let that beat Let that beat Let that beat Let that beat ride, yeah You did it. Go. Go. Okay, hurry up. Hurry up. Go. Go, go, go. Go, go, go! - Aja! - Sorry! Shh. All right, let's go. - The coordinates take us over there. - Oh. The darkest, creepiest, most haunted-looking section of the pier. Never fear the unknown. Wow! Just can't think of a better place for four teenagers from the suburbs. All right, little guy. Light the way. Synergy! Let's go. Jerrica! Where's it going? - This is it. - Oh, yeah. I totally remember this place. This is a tetanus shot waiting to happen. No, come on, it's been here forever. I used to love it as a little kid. That's the same song that turned Synergy on. I think one of the notes is flat. It's this one. Guys, look. Wow. I guess Dad wanted us to see this. Maybe it could be moved to make the right note. We'll see. Whoa. That's so crazy. This is the first time that he taught me how to play. - What does it mean? - I don't know. I'm a rock star! What? Whoa! Here, help me. - Whoa, what is that? - I don't know. It's ancient. Open it. "Create your own destiny." Some assembly required. Looks like another map for the other piece. All right, the coordinates lead us to... - The Open Air Club. - The Open Air Club? You've heard of it? You haven't heard of it? Dude, that venue's legendary. Our dad used to talk about it all the time. Hands up, all of you! Turn to face me slowly! This isn't what it looks like. Really? Because it looks like trespassing on private property, unlawful entry, and worst of all... breaking curfew. - Rio. - How'd you know we were here? I left my iPhone in the glove compartment, tracked it all the way here. And it's my job to keep an eye on you, remember? Even if it means getting out of my bed and getting into a cab in the middle of the night. Thank you for that, by the way. He's so dramatic. You know, I think that we're fine on our own. Really? So you meant to trip the silent alarm when you broke in? - Oh, shoot. - Oh, my God. Look, we can take care of this ourselves. You sure about that? It's up to you, but I do have the fastest way out of here without getting caught. - I can't go back to juvie. - You're not going back to juvie. All right, fine. - What's your brilliant idea? - Jump. We jump? That's your plan? Jumping off the pier? - There's no way any of us are gonna jump into the... - See you later! - Ready? - Yeah. Let's go. Check. We have reports the gate is ajar on the pier. Come on, you gotta jump sometime. Hey, you guys! What are you doing? Hold it right there! Hey! No, don't! I don't know what you're so scared of, J. But whatever it is, you don't have to be. No. I feel uncomfortable. Just be yourself. Take this moment to decide who do you want to be? Who is that person? What does she look like? There are some ideas, some voices that are too special to keep hidden. Okay, this is completely insane. I get that your dad's having, uh... - Synergy. - Synergy... lead you to different clues, but why and for what? That's what we're hoping to find out at the Open Air Club. You guys aren't getting near that club without someone calling every last one of their favors. Even Starlight can't pull a venue like that. What? You seem like you're fatally allergic to positivity. Would it kill you to be a little bit more like your boss? I mean, maybe then we wouldn't feel the need to sneak out. For starters, Erica's not my boss. She's my mother. And the reason she's forcing me to keep you out of trouble is so I can learn about the family business and be exactly like her. Wait, so, hanging out with us is like a punishment? It's 3:00 AM, you stole my truck and all of you just committed your first felony. Okay, so you hate your job. Why don't you just quit? Because Starlight can make a difference again, you know, if it backed actual artists. You know, real musicians with something to say. Instead, my mom wastes her time on no-talent pop tarts with all flash, no substance and couldn't sing without auto-tune if their lives depended on it. All right. Not bad. You don't think we're gonna make it, do ya? Mm, mm, mm You don't think we're gonna last that long Mm, mm, mm, mm But we'll be standing together - All the way - All the way It's obvious we'll prove you wrong Ohh - So come a little closer now - Ohh Listen to us all a little - Ohh - We've got nothing here to hide No, no, no, no - We don't gotta fake you out - Ooh - We'll be shooting down the middle - Ooh - You'll see the truth in time - Ooh Mm And we know why Why Because We got heart - Me and you - Ohh Me and you Hold up - You think that I'm a puppet, don't ya? - Ohh! Ooh Just wait until my strings are pulled Oh, yeah There's no one in the curtains Just so you know You know, you know I'm sitting here on my own throne So - So come a little closer now - Ooh - Listen to us all a little - Ooh We've got nothing here to hide We don't gotta hide, no - We don't gotta fake you out - No - I'll be shooting down the middle - Yeah And you'll see the truth in time Mm And we know why Why Because - We got heart - Ooh Because - We got heart - Ohh Because We got heart - Me and you - Ooh Me and you Hey, hey! Go, Synergy. Go, Synergy. Go, Synergy. Whoo! Ow! Shut up! I'm trying to sleep! Stupid kids. Erica! Erica! Thank you. Shut your mouths. Judy, I love what you did with your hair. And, Bobby, what happened to yours? Are you under a little stress? All right, I'm just gonna jump right in. Yes, the rumors are true. We hacked, we scoured, we stalked. We did everything we could to find her and we did. I am so honored to announce Starlight has signed the Internet phenomenon... Jem. Erica! Over here! Erica! Erica! Effective immediately, we will be taking over her YouTube page. Starlight's Web site will be the only source for Jem content and information. Okay, but, Erica, we've seen all that. When do we get to see her in person? There will be three pop-up shows in and around Los Angeles. These will be the first performances she does live with her band. And we're fielding offers now, so stay tuned. Where is this supposed girl even from? You think I would tell you, of all people? Have you read your publication? No. In a world where everything is public, this is the first true mystery of the decade, isn't it? And we plan on keeping her that way. Jem is a symbol, you know, and her voice speaks the truth. She has attitude, she has style, and in a world where there's so many fake Jems... like your necklace, Rebecca... Starlight has the real deal. Our Jem shines. - Whoopee! - Whoo! Jem in the house! Go, Jem! Go, Jem! All right, rehearsal time. Let's go. - Come on. - I'm in a food coma, Rio.

Girls, don't get lazy on me! Don't go to sleep! - We're doing this! - Okay. All right! As much as I'd love to continue celebrating, we still have a lot of work to do. Because now you have to prove that you earned that spot. Okay, come on. Thanks, Rio. We are here at the Open Air Club in Los Angeles, California, where tonight, the Internet mystery known as Jem will be performing live for the very first time. There are three simple rules to taking pictures on the red carpet. First, posture makes perfect. Second, lean your weight on the back of your leg so the camera sees you as taller and slimmer. Third, the most important... smile, but don't make faces. This isn't your high school graduation. Paparazzi are not your friends. And a bad photo lives longer than vampires. Got it? Stand up straight, lean back, smile without moving our faces. Oh, and squinch. Squinch? - Now do you see what I'm doing? Sort of... - Yeah. You're good. You're a natural. That's good. Not so good. Oh, and look like you're having fun, but don't really have fun.

Congratulations, ma'am. I think you've done it again. Thinking was never your strong suit. Whoo. Can we get your autograph? - Can you sign my picture? - That was incredible! Dude, this is hands down the best night of my life. Guys, I think this is my dad's guitar. Are you serious? How can you tell? Look. - Try turning it. - Turning it? Oh! - Can this come off? - Let's try it. Yes! - What is it? - I don't know. "Use your gifts." Here we go. All right, Dad, let's see what you're trying to do. - Wasn't that the last piece? - I thought it was, but it looks like there's room for one more, maybe? How are we supposed to find it without a map? I don't know. This doesn't make any sense. Hi! What are your names? Thank you so much. I'm so glad you liked the show. Hey. Sorry, Jerrica. Thanks. Music isn't something that can be put into words. Three notes can communicate what a whole paragraph never could. You know, we each have a rhythm inside of us... our heartbeat, and it connects us all. No translation required. So when the path you're on allows you to hear it for the first time, it's like the whole world suddenly falls into perfect harmony. Even if it isn't. Shutting down. There was magic in the air last night as Starlight's Jem and her band of sisters performed live, revealing a whole new look from the pink hair YouTube video that went viral earlier this month. We love you, Jem! - I'm a huge Jem fan. - I love Jem. Her music is amazing. It's, like, real music. - And one other one. - Which one? - Jem. - Whoa! That's what I'm talking about. Right now, it's already trending on Twitter right now. - Hashtag Jem. - Did you love it? Apparently he loves it. I love it so much. And boy, oh, boy, they hit a home run. Lines are out the door at salons today. Everyone wants the Jem hair! Pink, purple, red, blue. You name it. Uh, in this video, I will show you how to do the makeup for Jem. I wanted to play you this Jem-inspired song that I wrote. To be able to sit down and have a glass of wine with Jem, and just hang and chill it like... like we're girlfriends, that would be everything. Their song, "Youngblood," has leaked onto the Internet and is clearly climbing the streaming and download charts. Oh, my God! "Youngblood." I dig the track. You gotta make a track for me, by the way, next. You can't call it "Youngblood." Let's call it, like, "Badass Blood." Actually, no. That sounds like something you don't want. Never mind. - Jem. - But as the Jem phenomenon continues, the biggest question only grows... Who is Jem? Jem and I dated for like six weeks. It was pretty serious. I don't think she's even a real person. She's more of a product. You know, maybe it doesn't even matter, because the only thing people want is Jem. My s-sister watched it, not me. Let me shrink out. Be there in a sec. - Hey... Oh! - Oh! No. You're not wearing clothes. Um, I'm gonna come back later. I think I can fix that. Come on in. - I'll be there in a sec. - Okay. Wow! I can't believe the mysterious Jem has come to pay me a visit. Nice room you got here. Yeah, well, it's not the Rock Star Suite. Uh, I just... I might be having a secret identity crisis. - I don't really have anyone else to talk to about that. - Huh. Well, it's a good thing you came over, 'cause I just so happen to know the answers to all of life's problems. What would that be? Breakfast. And it just seems like ever since we got here that... that I've been leading this double life, you know? 'Cause Jem was supposed to be a disguise and something that I could hide behind. But now it just seems to be this other version of me, and I don't know, more and more it seems to be the only version that, you know, people want. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Don't get me wrong. - Jem's pretty incredible. I mean, she's talented, - Oh! amazing on stage. She has outrageous fashion sense, beautiful hair... just pink. Did I ever tell you pink's my favorite color? You know, I wouldn't have guessed, - but now I can kind of see it, knowing you. - Oh. - You know what I mean? Knowing you. - Is that right? I really can tell that pink is... Now you're making me jealous of my secret identity. And that is something I did not think was possible. Well, you didn't let me finish. I mean, yes, Jem is glamour and glitter, fashion and fame, and I can't imagine how tempting it might be to lose yourself to something like that. When I look at you, I don't see Jem. In my eyes, you're the same incredible girl that I sang with under the pier that night. And you always will be. Don't underestimate yourself. You promise me that? I promise. - So, um... - Oh, Erica. Hi. Um, I'm gonna go, um, work on the guitar for the next song. This isn't what I had in mind when I said, "Keep a close eye on the girls." Listen, you've got it all wrong. She's no longer Jerrica. Okay? She's bigger than that. She's our business. And if you want a part in that business, you need to be disciplined, you need to be all business head all the time. Honey, I want what's best for you. - No, you don't. - You know I do. I want you to run this company one day. That's exactly what your father would have wanted. But you don't know what you want. Just because you and I don't see eye-to-eye sometimes, doesn't mean I don't know what I want. I'm assigning you to a different artist. This isn't working. Stay away from her. I know I'm not okay Got just myself to blame I never thought I could lose Ah, ah Blinded by the lights They're messing with my mind Don't wanna be a movie star tonight Striking every pose Glitter isn't gold Hey, don't worry about me. Now, you girls just concentrate on what you're doing there. - Okay. - And everything will be fine. I will be here when you get back. Okay? How are things at the store? A little slow, but, uh, I don't know, reminds me of when I first started, you know? Putting in the long hours, working solo. Wait, did you let the rest of the staff go? Aunt Bailey, you didn't need to do that, okay? I'm telling you, the money is ours at the end of the month. We have plenty of time. It's gonna be fine. - And you have the hearing coming up, so... - We don't. Jerrica, I lost the appeal. So, we just have till the end of this week. Um, no. Y-You know what? It's... It's gonna be just fine. I'm gonna take care of this, I promise. I'm gonna talk to Erica. We're gonna make this work, no matter what. Okay. I have to go. I love you. Bye. I-I think what I'm asking for is an advance or something. Just an advance? Consider it done. Thank you. I'm... I'm sorry. - Oh, my gosh. Sorry. - Only I ask one little thing of you. What is this? Well... Is this like, uh... like, a solo contract? Why do you look so surprised? You deserve it. Do you know how many artists take years to get to this place? Some never do. But you are different. - You're special. - Thank you. Um, that means a lot to me, Erica. But I... Just so we're on the same page, you know? My sisters are... They're the whole reason I'm in LA to begin with. Of course they are. - And they're incredible. - Yeah. But LA is just the starting point. Where you go from here, that's up to you. Let me turn you into an icon. An icon is not one of four. It's one-of-a-kind. Then you'll support your whole family, not just this moment, for the rest of their lives. Do you get that? For the rest of their lives. Oh, I want this for you. I really do. But you have to really want it for yourself. Otherwise, you would leave me no choice but to replace you. But anyone can be Jem. Remember? Nobody knows who she is. And Starlight owns the name, the logo, the costumes. So, you wouldn't just be losing the house. You would lose everything that we built together. - You don't wanna do that. - Right. It's exciting. - Okay? - Okay. - Bye. See you later. - Bye. Okay, listen. I know it's probably very difficult trying to break this news to the girls. But now that you are officially Starlight's newest solo act, you rely on me for those types of phone calls, you know? - Let me lift the burden for you. - Yeah. You just sort of let it go. Put that game face on and just shine. Have a great show. We were just talking about you. Yeah, we know. We heard everything. Wait. Let me... Let me explain what's been going on, okay? Explain what? What are you gonna explain? - That you wanna go solo? - I tried to tell you guys, but we were gonna lose the house, and I thought I could take care of it, - so we could always be together as a family. - No! No. You do not get to do that. You cannot use us as an excuse for lying. That's not how a family is supposed to work. This whole band, we've supported you. So you don't want us around anymore? You could've respected us enough to tell us to our face. I've had it. I'm done. Me too. Wait, Kimber. Can you just... just please try and understand? Please don't do that. Please don't do that, J. Listen, I don't need you to take care of me. I'm not some little girl anymore. This isn't right, you know? I mean, whatever it is Dad wanted you to do, do you... do you think this is it? Jem! Jem! Jem! Jem! Jem! Jem! Ladies and gentlemen... Jem! I've been here in this place I've been stuck in this space Like a ghost that's been missing its life Silent words in my mouth Yeah, they want to scream out And I'll leave my old shadow behind In my heart and out of my mind Oh, whoa I'll go, but I won't go quietly Go down, but I'll go down fighting Don't know where Don't know why But I can't go back, back to the way I was I'll show who I am from the inside Gonna take my walk on the wild side Don't know where Don't know why But I can't go back, back to the way I was Oh, whoa Oh, whoa, oh Oh, whoa Oh, whoa, oh Oh, whoa Oh, whoa No, I can't go back, back to the way I was I'm the leaf I'm a seed That's been waiting for spring I'm a girl reinventing herself We might fall We might rise We are all butterflies Breaking free from our jars on the shelf Finding out the truth for ourselves Oh, whoa I'll go, but I won't go quietly Go down, but I'll go down fighting Don't know where Don't know why But I can't go back, back to the way I was I'll show who I am from the inside Gonna take my walk on the wild side Don't know where Don't know why But I can't go back, back to the way I was Oh, whoa Oh, whoa, oh Oh, whoa Oh, whoa, oh Oh, whoa Oh, whoa No, I can't go back, back to the way I was I'll go, but I won't go quietly Go down, but I'll go down fighting Could be hurt Could be love But I can't go back, back to the way I was I'll go, but I won't go quietly - Go down, but I'll go down fighting - Oh, oh, oh And go down fighting Don't know where Don't know why But I can't go back, back to the way I was I'll show who I am from the inside Gonna take my walk on the wild side Don't know where Don't know why But I can't go back, back to the way I was Oh, whoa Oh, whoa, oh Oh, whoa Oh, whoa, oh Oh, whoa Oh, whoa No, I can't go back, back to the way I was Oh, whoa Oh, whoa, oh Oh, whoa Oh, whoa, oh Oh, whoa Oh, whoa No, I can't go back, back to the way I was In July 1973, The Everly Brothers self-destructed in front of a sold-out crowd. Phil smashed a guitar over Don's head and stormed off stage. It's a story that's been told over and over and over again. It happens. Bands break up. But we were supposed to be different. Maybe I was wrong. I guess sisters can break up too. And when I realized that, I knew there was only one place left for me to go. I thought I might find you here. Kimber... I know that I've ruined everything. Yeah, you were kind of a jerk, and you made some mistakes that hurt a lot, but I know you were just trying to do the right thing. You should've just told us the truth from the beginning, J. But if coming here proves anything, it's that, this is... this is just a house, you know? A home is where you're surrounded by people who you love and who love you regardless. So... Solo contract or not... you're stuck with me. Thank you. Actually, you're stuck with all of us. Ever since you've gone, I just... I can't stop thinking about how nobody else understands what we've been through. And I would rather lose everything than live my life without you. Did you just quote a Beyonc song? Yeah, 'cause she got it so right. Oh, my gosh. - We love you. - We love you. - I love you guys so much. - Shh. We talked about it, - and we know how much it means for you to finish Synergy. - No. So we're here to help you, together. What else could we do? We followed every map and every clue. Which is why your dad believed in you enough to know you would figure it out. - We needed a ride. - Mm. He wanted you to solve this, Jerrica. Otherwise, why would he give you Synergy as his final gift? No, I mean, the last thing that he gave me was... Oh, my God. That's it. Kimber's alien handwriting? I was a baby, Shana. No! The starburst! My earrings. "Use your gifts." They have to be the last piece to Synergy. Well, where are they? Starlight. Starlight. Yeah. Hold on a second. The building's a fortress. Security everywhere. There's no way you're getting in and out without some serious help. Who said we had to ask for permission? So, your plan is that? Okay. To break in? I think I might be able to help. Me too. What are sisters for? Okay, that was weird. Maybe we should go get our earrings now? - Yeah, we've got a lot of work to do. Let's go. - Okay. Oh, by the way, you're our way in. Wait, what? - Are you insane? - I'm not asking you to give it to me. I just need to borrow it for a couple of hours. No one needs to know. Sure. 'Cause nothing screams "subtle" like your mom's car. What's in it for me? No, no, no. Don't... No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want your dirty money. I want access. "Valet of the Damned"? Have you never checked your Facebook invites? I invite you to every single show. If you can get your mom to listen to that demo, then we're in business, Rio. I'll see what I can do. Promise me. Oh! Say, "I promise you, Brad." Say, "Brad" at the end of it. Listen to it in the car right now. I think you're gonna like it. What have I done? Good evening, Ms. Raymond. Hey! This is Starlight Enterprises. This is where Erica Raymond discovered Jem. And her awesome sisters. I mean, like, seriously, let's not forget how underrated they are. - Okay. Yes. - We are huge Starlight fans. - Can you please take a picture? - Oh, my gosh! - Thank you so much. - Oh, my God! I love it. - Can you... - Turn it, turn it. - Sideways. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - What, this way? - Flash on. - Yeah, thank you. - Sideways. - Flash on. - Do you guys know Jem? Mmm. - I love it. - We're good. Let's switch sides. Can you actually do it with my phone? Can you both take it at the same time? - At the same time. - Got an upgrade, thanks to Daddy. - Face this way. This upgrade... Yeah. - Okay. One, two, three... Jem. - And the sisters. - And the sisters. I can't believe that worked. Getting in is the easy part. Getting out is slightly harder. - Love it. Love it. - Great, great. - Okay, thank you. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - I really appreciate it. Thank you so much! Oh, my God! - It's one single key. - Yes. - Yep. - Yes, yes, yes. I've seen that key before. And, um, I... I could've sworn that they were here a second ago. And I could've sworn that you had a job at the beginning of this conversation. So, my key to my car. Find it, now. Someone stole it? Are you saying that to me? Or are you asking me a question? Yes. Okay. - Yes? - Oh, Rio! Rio. It's Rio, okay? Rio came in here, and he was acting crazy. He just took your keys, and he took my demo. He's probably trying to stop you from signing me and sharing our music with the world. Aah! Nobody cares about your music! Where did he go? - Away. I don't kn... - Zipper! - Where did he go? - Ow! Ooh. Starlight. Starlight! Everybody loves our music. - That's all of my best guesses. - We must be missing something. Like, what's the most important thing to her? When you put it that way. - Seriously? - Security through insecurity. - Is it there? - Yeah. What is that? It's my dad's will. - Search every room on this floor. - Yes, ma'am. - I know they're in here. - Shoot! It's Erica. North side of the building. You do the south side. They're coming down the hallway. How did they know we were here? My office. What are you doing? Keeping... a promise. It's not bad. Who are these guys? It's a distraction. Yeah. They're new, right? No one's here, ma'am. Check security feeds on the 25th floor. We have potential intruders. Copy that. Checking out the surveillance feeds now. Everything looks clear. Over. Wha... Oh, I love this one. Nolan. Robinson. Check this out. It's a squirrel. If a squirrel can water-ski, you know, we can do anything, guys. That ought to buy them some time. - Whoo! - Whoo! Look at those chubby cheeks! I just can't get over 'em. - Just like... - They're just so chubby and cute and delicious! Aw. Yeah. Did you leave this open? Put the building on lockdown, and put a guard at every exit, and tell them to look for Jerrica and my son. They leave here under no circumstances. She's playing that show tonight. Understood? I think it's safe to say they know we're here. - Got any ideas? - Yeah. Yeah, wait. - Uh... - I've a whole bagful. Can you hold that? Okay. Well, where the hell is Rafferty, huh? - He's supposed to be here. - He's on the schedule. Uh... Uh, ma'am? Ma'am! We're gonna need to see some ID, please. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Is there a problem? Oh! Um, no, no, no. No, there's... there's no problem. We actually don't need to see ID. I know exactly who you are, Jem. Perfect. 'Cause I was just leaving for the night. Sorry. My-My daughter would kill me if I... if I didn't get an autograph. - Of course. No problem. Let's do it. - Big fan. - We know all the words. - Do you have a pen? Oh. If you got young blood, live to party - Come on Something, something - That's... Those aren't the words, but okay. - She says it's the new "Let It Go." - Really? - Yeah. Her words, not mine. - Thank you. - From Frozen? - Yeah! - Do you have a pen on you? - Thank you. No, I don't have a pen, actually. Guys, pen? Yes! Thank you. Oh, perfect. Okay. - Do you... - Head shot. Like, an 8x10 would be great. Glossy. - I don't have anything on me. - Check this out. - Maybe we could do it another time. - Right here. She's gonna freak. - Oh. On your arm? - Yeah. - Oh, okay. - Thank you so much. Yeah. Uh, what is your daughter's name? You just put down "Stephen." Okay. "To Stephen." - Boy names are popular for... - Right. girls nowadays. "Heart, Jem." How old is she? Oh, she... she's... You know, kids. - Thank you so much. This is so... Thank you. - Yeah, no problem. - Got it! - Have a good night. Ow! - Jem, you rule! - You do! She was all over me, by the way. She was. Come on, we got this. All right, here we go. Level check. It's working. No, I think it's working. Is it working? Yeah, I know. Jerrica. Are you there? Jerrica? Pretty cool, right? If you're seeing this, then the curious little girl who used to sneak into my workshop has grown... into the strong, resourceful woman I always knew you'd become. And overcome losses that no child deserves to face. And I'm so proud of you. When I found out how little time I had left... I knew I needed to leave you something. Try to... To try to teach you the lessons that I most wanted to pass on. To never fear the unknown. To create your own destiny. To use your gifts to... inspire people. So, I built Synergy. She's my way of saying good-bye. She? And I left you that trail of clues that you were brave enough to follow, even though you had no idea where that adventure might lead you. The pier. That was the one place where your eyes would always fill with wonder. It's the one place where you always wanted to go. Think of it as a reminder that... that your destiny can be as mysterious and vast... and beautiful as any ocean. The Open Air Club. That was the one place I always wanted to take you when you were older. Some of the greatest artists I've ever seen were on that stage. And they used their gifts to inspire anyone willing to listen. Whatever journey you take, whatever journey you choose, I know you can do the same. And now the hardest thing that a father can do is to let his little girl go. But you're ready. You have so much ahead of you, Jerrica. And where you go now is up to you. Use all you've learned to... to be the best version of yourself you can be. Oh, and just so you know, my greatest creation was... was never Synergy. It's always you and Kimber. Be there for each other. Time with family, with the ones you love most, there's nothing more valuable than that. I wish I could be there with you to see the person you've become. But I'm still... But I'm still with you, Jerrica. And in my heart, you'll always be my Jem. Daddy! Daddy! Oh! Hey, sweetheart. How you doing? What are you working on? Well, I'm working on my greatest creation. I promise you'll see it when you're a little older. Okay? Okay. I love you, Jerrica. I love you too, Dad. I love you too, Dad. He was right. About everything. I have to fix this. So, here we are. Um... I promised you the truth and a confession of who I really am. Um, and if this has taught me anything, it's that the best answer is the one that's been with you all along. So, the truth is, and has always been, that... my name is Jerrica Benton. And these are my sisters... Shana, Aja and Kimber. Hi! None of this could've happened without you guys. - Oh. - Mmm. I guess it's time to upload this and tell the world who we really are. Unless... No, Jerrica, I know that look. Well, I don't know. You know, just 'cause a video started this, I don't know if that's just the right way to end it too. You know? What are you trying to say? We go to our final concert tonight. At midnight, we walk out on stage together and instead of telling the world who we are, we show them. - Yes! I was hoping you'd say that. - Yes. Okay. Well... I guess we won't be needing this anymore. I make your speakers bang We are here at Jem's final pop-up concert downtown, and it is mayhem. At this point, Jem has become a lightening rod of creativity for young people everywhere. I really wish I could claim all these people were excited for me, but it's actually because Jem is showing up any minute. In fact, the number one trending topic on Twitter, globally, is hashtag Jem. Thousands of her fans are posting videos every minute with messages for the star. Stop it. Stop laughing. Stop it, sister. All right, ladies. - Ooh, I really like that. - Right? It looks so cool. Okay, Jem, I don't know if you'll ever see this, but I need you to know that your music is the only thing that's got me through the last couple of weeks. You're a diamond in a... Rough. That's how school's been lately. But whenever some kid bullies me, your voice keeps me going. It reminds me I'm not so... Misunderstood. I know my parents want what's best for me, but all we ever do is fight. But then one of your songs came on, and we started talking. And for once, they were actually starting to... Listen. That's all I ever did. I barely talked at home, in class. Then I heard you and felt like singing. It's like I finally found my... Voice. That's what your songs give me. They're everything I feel but can't express. The world is a better place because of you... and I hope you never ever forget that. I love you. Hey. Yeah, I know what I need to do. Showtime, Synergy. - Ooh! - Cute! - You look amazing! Wow! - Oh, my gosh! Whoo! Look so good, J. - You sure you're ready for tonight? - Yeah. You're under contract, remember? Which means, you're going on solo, - and the concert's going as planned. - No. It's not. She's right. Not after you hear what I have to say. Really? What is that, Rio? What, are you coming to the aid of one of your damsels in distress? No, this is me living up to my potential. I know what I want. I want to lead Starlight. The company can make a difference again if it takes risks. Rio, but you're not ready. Especially after tonight, you'll never be ready. Had a feeling you'd say that. And apparently Dad did too. That's why his will gives me the right to take over the company the day I feel I am ready. Really? Wow. It's not his to give anymore. Especially, since I'm the only one with a copy to the will. Oh. Are you sure about that? It's over, Mom. I'm taking over the company. - Zipper! - Gentlemen, remove Ms. Raymond from the concert. - Immediately. - Wait, what? Zipper. I took you from nothing. You ungrateful... All that I've given you! You guys have dental, right? We'll talk about it later. Okay. Take your hands off me! You tell your girls, this isn't the end of anything. Well, hey, why don't you just look at it as an opportunity to leave this old life behind? Escape that world of dismal mediocrity and decided who you really wanna be. Touch. - Aunt Bailey! - Jerrica! Surprise! - Hi! - Hi, Kimber. Hi, girls. Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen, Jem! Jem! Jem! Jem! Whoo! We love you! - Yeah! - Whoo! I know you guys all came here tonight expecting a big show. Yeah! Jem! But first, we decided that it's about time that you know who we really are, who I really am. Yeah! Um... the truth is though, for a long time I didn't know who that was. So, I let other people defined me. Until tonight, when we realized who Jem really is. And it's not me. Jem is anybody who has something that they wanna express. And they need the courage to let themselves be heard. You know, it's anyone with a dream who needs a way to make it happen. Yeah! It's anybody who has something that they want to share with the world. It's you. It's you. It's him. It's her. You're Jem. We're all Jem! This is our time! Whoo! Whoo! Go, Jem! Lost and defeated, but still I stand My heart in pieces will beat again There is a story written in the stars That makes it worth it just to bear these scars Left foot forward and then my right It's not over, I've still got fight You get that feeling when you cross that line Like it was worth it just to take what's mine Brave enough to be broken Oh, oh Can't see, but keep going, oh Brave enough to be broken There's no more fear inside I threw my heart in the fire I've never fallen from higher But I'm still here I'm still here I threw my heart in the fire I've never fallen from higher But I'm still here I'm still here I'd struggled with my ideas of beauty. I didn't know what this was. But all I saw was this lady with pink hair and star earrings. And I was like... Wow! Like, these girls are badass and they just made a very big impression on me. I can't really sing or dance very well, but... She basically taught me that it's okay to be who you are and not to be afraid. I'm not invisible. That I have a voice and that I should express what I feel every time I get the moment. Dress the way I wanna dress. Speak my mind. Just being you. I've had purple hair. I've had pink hair... This is my real hair, and I love Jem. She stands out in a very humble way. We love you, Jem! - Whoo-hoo! - Jem inspired me. I just want to say thank you for that. I threw my heart in the fire I've never fallen from higher But I'm still here I'm still here Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I'm still here - I'm still here - Yes! - Oh, oh - Rio? Lindsey Pierce, editor at Rolling Stone. Nice to meet you, Lindsey. I think you've really got something special happening here tonight. - I'd like to give all four girls the cover. - Huh? What would they like to call the band? I'm still here How about Jem and the Holograms? Yeah, sure. Not bad. I threw my heart in the fire I've never fallen from higher But I'm still here I'm still here I threw my heart in the fire I've never fallen from higher But I'm still here I'm still here Yes! Yes! Yeah! All right, I guess you are a rock star. I threw my heart in the fire I've never fallen from higher But I'm still here I'm still here Yeah. Who's got the heart of a hunter? Pounding like thunder Prowling the night Hot like an Indian summer Beat of a drummer Coming alive If you got game, boy, you can pass go We can go fast or we can go slow We can get high or we can get low No, there ain't no rules tonight If you got young blood, live to party Red-hot Feeling naughty Get loose Go grab somebody Whoa-oh-oh, oh-whoa If you got young blood, this is our time Hands up Touch the skyline Tonight, yeah, I'ma get mine Whoa-oh-oh, oh-whoa If you got young blood, blood, blood, blood Young blood, blood, blood If you got young blood, blood, blood, blood - Young blood, blood, blood - Whoa-oh-oh, oh-whoa Whoa-oh-oh, oh-whoa I've got this thing Gonna blow your mind Pulling the string Helping you unwind Ladies, hi. So, this is where you've been hiding for all these years. I love the decorating, if that's what you call this. You got a lot of nerve coming here. Especially, after you dropped us from the label. Said that you wanted to... What was that, Stormer, that she said? Geez, Roxy. You know, I can't even remember. Didn't she say she could just, uh, replace us with some other band? How'd that work out for ya? I guess that just goes to show you how easily people can be replaced at Starlight. Doesn't it, Erica? That's fair, Jetta. I can see why you would be mad, but a lot has happened. Especially, since Rio fell in love with Jem. Wait! Pizzazz. Rio's with her? Yeah. I'm not just looking for another band. Not anymore. I need something dynamic and powerful. I need one that would be willing to... destroy Jem. Lady, you came to the right place. Our songs are better. We're gonna get her. - Come with me. - Okay. I got, got I-I-I got it, got it I got it I got it I got it
