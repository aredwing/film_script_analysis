Now please follow me and watch your step. Centuries ago huge festivals were held at the end of the grape harvest. And the virgins of the different towns would stomp the grapes to make the wine. As you have seen today now it's a much more sophisticated process. Do you have any questions? No? OK, feel free to look around and take pictures. Actually I have a question, can you take a photo of me and my friends? - Sure. - Thanks. Just push right there. - Halfway to focus. - OK. Gentlemen? Come on. - I can't move, por favor. - Yeah, I'm good here. Ariel, one photo for the mishbuka. Come on. Say wine! Wine. Everybody please, before you taste the wine, take a moment and try to find the different aromas in this Cabernet. Yeah, it's OK. Chi! - Le. - Le. Chichichi! Lelele! Viva Chile! L'chaim! Hey, stop it. You unfollowed her for a reason. I just want to know if she tweeted that guy again. Dude, you don't have x-ray vision to see her DM's. No, but I know her well enough to know what she's not saying. Last time I was single you met a girl and got her email. Now I feel like every girl I meet I have to download some new app. Whatever happened to meeting a girl in the park and saying hey... ...how about a cup of coffee? Don't worry Gringo, we're taking you to a nice park where you can ask a girl for coffee. Trust me. Here's your coffee. Gracias, Seor. Petaas. Labios. Sorry. Oh, it's my daughter. Hang on baby, I'm at a party, it's very loud, just a second. I have to go. Please... I just gotta talk to her. I have to talk to her. She's in California. Un minuto. Dos minuto. Gracias. I'm coming sweetie! It's just really loud right here. Just a second baby! Hey, honey! Hi Daddy! When are you coming home? I'll be home in two days. Sooner than you think. Hey, what about your sister? The further away the better. Kylie! Kylie! - Bye Daddy, Tom's here. - Who? Mommy's new boyfriend! Bye! Fuck! Next. Next. Next. No, we're having so much fun. I'll call you when I get back. OK. Love you. Hey. You're American? - Yes. - That's really... I'm... Obviously me too. I'm from... Where you from? - Los Angeles. - I'm from San Diego. That was a crazy flight here, right? That was like 12 hours, did you come here for the concert? No. Oh, I didn't either. I came to this with some friends. They kinda took me here. But this is crazy, right? It's really cool. Umm... I don't have... I don't have any... I don't have any cards but, umm, if you're ever in San Diego. If I'm ever in San Diego, what? If you're ever in San Diego, umm, there's a awesome zoo. Hi. I have a boyfriend. Oh, that's really cool. You guys... is he here? You guys been together for a long... We're done, thanks. Cool... Nice meeting you. Don't you ever leave my side again. OK, I thought you were behind us. Names? Oh, we're on the list. A guy put us on there. It was a foreign name, 'cause we're not from here. It was something like, you know... Pedro... Full name? Full name. OK. I'm Kylie, this is Irina. - Hello. - What's your name? Full name. Next. - Next. - Next. Like! Isn't that the girl from last night? Yeah, yeah let me check. Yeah, it's the same. Antonio! Hi! I mean, why should I stay. All the clubs here are the same as everywhere else. Same people, same DJ's... Same hipster music. I thought South America was going to be like third-world. But like, cool third-world. You know, like Bali. Well, it is if you know where to go. The best parties are hidden. There's one party tomorrow night in Valparaiso. That's the real Chile. People think Chile is like City of God or something. Or like Juarez, like there's bodies hanging in the streets. This place is awesome! It's like the indie station of Latin America. It's like really cool, the food here is so fresh. There's no preservatives in anything. I'm sorry. We actually could stay. The only problem is my sister. That girl is your sister? Technically yes, same dad. It's not like I know her, she was off with her mom in Hungary. She's a real pain in the ass. So, I forgave her. But then she fucked this other guy. I don't understand why she keeps texting me. Look what she just sent to me. Look. I know it's in Spanish, but you get the point, right? - Right. - Excuse me. I can translate it for you. - You're kidding me? - It's champagne. I don't make the rules. No, you enforce them which is worse. Too bad. Hey, don't worry. When you're 21 you can drink without anyone's permission. I am 21. I don't need anybody's permission. Good girl. Your boyfriend. No. My son. - I have a daughter. - I'm not surprised. Really, why is that? Because, you're dressed like a dad. Fuck you. Check this out, I looked like this when we met. That's you? True story. - When did you lose it? - A year ago. That's when she started liking me. She's so superficial. Monica! Monica! Pollo just invited us to Valparaiso. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the coolest thing in Chile. There's a huge party. We're leaving tomorrow. Valparaiso is a really nice place. It's made of human skin. - What? - Scale, Ariel. Human scale. Yeah, yeah that's right. Human scale. You don't need a car, you can walk everywhere. It's great. Come on, Monica. Pollo changed our tickets. He upgraded us to business class. It's done. Kylie! You can't just change plans. You have to consult me. What's your fucking problem? It's just one night and we're out of coach. It's so close, let's go see it. No, no. You're coming back with me tomorrow. No. I can do whatever I want. No, you can't. As you've repeatedly proven. OK, let's see what Daddy has to say about it. Ooooh. Listen... Sofia... Monica. You have nothing to worry about. Pollo's dad owns a boutique hotel in Valparaiso. It's a really nice place... and it's very safe. Housing is the least of my concerns. It doesn't matter anyway. There's no way our dad would let her go. Daddy would like a word. Hello? OK guys! Welcome to Valparaiso city. I'm Ariel. Or Ariel for you. First of all, we're going to eat. There's a great restaurant round the corner. Great shellfish. I know it's not Kosher. - We have chicken for you. - OK good, thank you. Who wants ice cream! - Kylie. Kylie. - Hold. on. Hey! Don Pollo! I used to play this song with my band. Muscle Rock. It just came to me... in a dream. # Monica You're so white # # Better keep away from the sun # # You come from Hungary But aren't you hungry? # # Eat your goulash # and you'll be fine # Play with your Rubik Cube # Budapest is your home Let's go. Isn't there another way like steps? It's a quick ride and it's beautiful. Come on. Hey Monica, it's only a hundred years old, look. - Why is that? - It's because we're Jews. Dude it's like thirty seconds. We'll take the Jew car. Yeah we didn't want to ride with you guys anyway. Yeah, fuck you guys. No, waiting is for poor people. Let's go. Muchas gracias. What did he say? Have a nice trip. Check it out. This is just stunning. I can't believe you guys almost missed this. - This is the Chile I wanted to experience. - Yeah, right. Wow! These are really cool favelas. I want one for my backyard. Honey, I'll buy you a favela. Poor people included. - Like the view? - Yeah. Christ! What the fuck, Pollo. What's going on. Is this part of it? I don't know. Hola. Hola! We're not going to fall down, it's OK. Come on. Right? Hola! Gracias! I wasn't scared. That was exciting, well done Pollo. That's awesome. Jews are not meant for tragedy. We don't handle it well. - Say dead bodies! - Dead bodies! Another message from Sofia. You want to know what it says? - Stay back. - My hero! Hey, what does that say? It says... "Beware, dead babies." That's not funny. Pollo, no baby jokes. It says, don't be afraid, I am with you. They created this monument for all the orphans who died. People come here all the time to make wishes. I don't get it, why are there so many orphans. You see that church? They say that the priests and the nuns would meet to have sex in secret tunnels. And when they got pregnant... They buried the babies under here. Do those tunnels still exist? I don't know but there's a short cut to the church down that way. Let's go. I'm not going into the tunnels. OK. Hey Gringo, if you want to fuck this girl, You need a little bit more than hair gel. This is what I look like when I go out. Hey, I'm team Gringo, OK? I'm helping you. Look, if there's one thing I learned from my asshole dad, is that lying works. I don't know, tell her you can hook her up with your contacts in L.A. or something like that. That girl's pretty experienced. She's not going to fall for that bullshit. Come on, Gringo. They're all the same. They just want to be upgraded to business class. - Hey! - What? That's the girl from the vineyard! The guide. The Wu-Tang girl. Yeah. Who do you think put her on the list. Second lesson, always have a plan B. I'm learning, Pollo. - Carmen! - Pollo! Where's the bathroom, please? The bao? Don't let her drink, please. It's not a joke. Thanks mom! We have it. Love you. Really fast. Really fast. Wait a second, OK? It's OK. - I was thinking about the energy of the universe. - What? The energy and how it brings people together, and there's really no such thing as a coincidence. And my corporation, my law firm, we just oversaw a corporate merger... What? Sorry? The merger, it's like a company that we did the deal for, they bought a modeling agency in Los Angeles. So now, randomly I have all these contacts, with these modeling agents. Pollo, told you to say that? No... It's coincidence. The business is full of idiots that think just because I'm Russian I'm starving. Last year, I made a hundred and fifty grand. How about you? You think it's too late for me to become a model? Well, maybe you lose ten pounds and don't put so much gel in your hair. Maybe you have a chance. You think maybe I have a chance? Pollo! Pollo! Pollo! You left me all alone! Oh, poor little thing. Let's go dance. - Phone... - Bye! Russell! Russell! Russell! - Who's this dude? - I don't know! I think they're saying Russell! Russell Dazzle! Pollo, amigo! Amigos. International friends. This is the Russian princess, Irina. Hey, where is Kylie? Dancing. Dancing... Irina is very pretty. Girlfriend? Ahh yeah, I mean it's new, we haven't quite... ...but it's pretty much on. - Gringo is very loca. - That's hilarious... Here, here, here... - Bye-bye. - Russell Dazzle. - He's amazing. - Pollo, what the fuck? How's that helping Team Gringo? It's not my fault you're too slow for this country. - Oh fuck you. - Fuck me? Come on Gringo, there's a million girls over there. Hey look, look, look. The cleaning lady isn't dancing with anyone. Oh maybe I'll tell her my father owns half the country, that seems to work. OK Gringo, if you wanna get fucked, then call your Ex. Nobody likes you here. Unlike you who everybody likes, clearly it has nothing to do with your Father's money. Look Gringo, I am not your buddy, OK? That's Ariel. So we don't need to pretend we like each other. - I'm not pretending. - Me neither. - Good. - Good. What was that? Nothing. Oh look at that, Russell Dazzle really knows how to move. It's Red Bull! Just checking. Shit, Pollo! OK. We're outta here. I'm not going anywhere. Come on, Monica, relax. It's just a little pot, she's not drinking. You stay outta this. He's right, he's right. You said no drinking. Monica, you should take her home. She's really out of control. Kylie you're completely wasted. I'm taking you home. Now. No. I'm not standing here all night. I'm finally having fun for the first time in months. And you want to ruin it for me. You want me to be as miserable as you. That's not going to happen. I'm sorry if you're incapable of having fun without drugs. - That's not my problem. - So, what is your problem? Because you never gave a shit about me until Daddy started paying you to. So go back to India, go back to your tent. Go find yourself. You need to listen to me, you're outta control. So, we're leaving now. No. I'm in control, and you will listen to me. I can do whatever I want! I'll do all the coke in Chile! I'll fuck any guy I want! Stop it! I already fucked Pollo while you were in the bathroom, and I sucked Gringo's cock! And you know what? I'm going to fuck everybody in this club! Who here wants to fuck, cause I'm ready! - Are you through? - Hardly. You want to know what Daddy said when she went off to India to find herself? I hope she never comes back. I only came to Valparaiso because I worry about you. But you don't give a fuck about anyone else. You're a selfish, spoiled, little shit! I'm selfish? That's actually funny, last I checked, you were the one who had an abortion and got Daddy to pay for it! What the fuck! Help me! Everyone all right? - Are you OK? - Where's Irina? Where's Ariel! Carmen! Carmen! Help me! Ariel! Carmen! Carmen! Ariel! - Ariel! - Pollo! - Pollo told us not to move! - It's over, come on! - Ariel! - Ariel! Ariel! Please find it! Please! Please! Help! Help! Help!

We're going to help you up. Ready? On three... One, two, three! Come on, you can do it. Fuck! Go! Go! Pollo, where's the car? Over there, over there. - What the fuck do we do! - Let's calm down, OK. My dad! My dad has a helicopter! He can take us out in ten minutes, OK. Check your phones! Check your phones for signal! Where's the hospital? It's on top of the hill, but I don't know how to get there. We got to stop someone! Here comes someone! Stop! Stay with him! We gotta find someone! He's going to lose consciousness. He's losing too much blood. Hold it! How do you feel? It only hurts when I laugh. There's a guy over there who can help him! - Kylie! - Seor. Seor A hospital? A hospital? A hospital? The roads are completely blocked. There's no cars anywhere. No! No! No! No! Dangerous! What the fuck is that! What! Tsunami! Tsunami! Let's go, let's go! A fucking tsunami's coming. Let's go!
