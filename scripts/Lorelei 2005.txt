Yet they endure, nurturing the resilient light of "hope". July 18th, Western Pacific Japanese waters USS Bonefish Gato-class submarine USS Fleischer Destroyer Lorelei August 6th, 08:15 Lt. Commander Masami? You've read Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment"? Perhaps... The story of Raskolnikov who kills an old loan shark then is consumed by guilt. August 6th, 15:00 Yokosuka Naval Base Remember who it was he really wanted to kill? No. Really... That's a shame. Pardon me. I'm Asakura of Naval Command. You need no introduction, Sir. By the way... You heard about today's atom bomb on Hiroshima? Yes. A ruthless and indiscriminate weapon that will change world history. You've been shore-based how long? Nearly 3 years. "Captain Coward", right? Why did you oppose Kamikaze attacks? I refuse to call 'suicide' a strategy. We invest so much in our young men it's wasteful to throw away that military potential. Let's speak frankly. I don't need a "yes-man". You abhor the pointless waste of young lives. But what if ordered to deploy suicide tactics? I have a vital mission. The US cruiser Indianapolis was caught off Tinian and sunk by our subs. Sadly she'd already delivered her cargo which was... an atomic bomb. Probably the one used on Hiroshima. For the Yanks, the bomb was maybe a demonstration. But if they have more, we're finished. One of our experts, Mr. Takasu... He brought something back from Germany. Follow me. This... is the I-507. An experimental ship given to us by Germany. I-507... A masterpiece of Nazi science, it's our last hope. Lt. Commander Masami. I hereby assign you command of the I-507 Stop the next atom bomb. You sail at 0500. Save Japan from annihilation. 06:30 August 7th- Uraga Straits I'm honored to serve with you again. Enemy ahead. Dive in 60 seconds. Prepare to dive. All hands forward. He runs like a coward, after all. Engines full stop. I can't read German. Can anyone stop this damn thing? What are you waiting for? Move your asses! Engine room, I said stop! Only one thing for it... That did the trick! Depth reading. We're at dive depth. Open all vents. Open all vents. Depth, 21... Depth, 21... Pitch 5 degrees. Depth, 21... Attention all hands. You heard about yesterday's atom bomb on Hiroshima. Our mission gives us the chance to prevent further atomic attacks. As you know, it's my first sortie in 3 years. It's a new ship... we're undermanned. and you misfits are lucky bastards to have survived this far. I know they're not ideal conditions. But the survival of our homeland rests on your shoulders. I don't care what's hiding in your past. Understood? Your presence aboard means you're our nation's last hope. Don't forget it. Do your utmost. If your heart's not in it, own up without shame... I'll send you home out of the forward tubes. Keep working. Some call me a "coward" but don't worry. You're in good hands. We will complete our mission. We will make it home. About that drill... A drill, huh... I timed it at 62 seconds. And you? The same. I want it down to 45. Do not drop your guard. Survival is about not giving up. I hate this guy. What's his problem with kamikaze tactics... No respect for us manned torpedo pilots? Too many fine words... Behind there, our torpedoes await. We'll be ordered to attack soon. That's the secret mini-sub. No, torpedoes, surely... Who's wasting precious air? You again. Names? Special Assault Squad, pfc Origasa. Same... pfc Kiyonaga. Kamikaze torpedo crew, huh? I'll nail courage into you. Stand to attention. Perhaps it's unwise to hit men before their mission. Hold your tongue. Who'd you think you are? What's going on? Sir, please tell us our mission. Don't speak out of turn. Return to your posts. You two, report to me later. Sorry for that. It's a motley crew... Did you know? No. No-one told me of suicide corps on my ship. My apologies. They're pilots of the mini-sub. Meaning... it's a suicide weapon? No. It's a tracking device. If sonar is a ship's ears, Lorelei is its eyes. The Germans named it after a mythic witch, "Lorelei" Imperial Navy Headquarters August 7th, 09:25 August 7th, 09:25 Today at 0500, the I-507 set sail in secret. Whose orders? Captain Asakura's, I believe. Where is he now? We don't know. We're searching. The best cadet the Naval Academy ever produced. He's been a wild card since he fought in the South Pacific. We must track him down. Figure out who's helping him. Director of Intelligence, it's your direct responsibility. We arrive here by end of day on 11th. We'll test Lorelei, the new sonar. We're to sink the ship carrying the new atom bomb and shut enemy sea lanes. Our nation's survival depends on us. Gentlemen, I'm counting on you. I wonder how good this Lorelei is? No need to worry. The Lorelei system is infallible. But don't forget our orders. "Avoid the enemy at all costs" Capt. Asakura was most specific. August 7th, 22:55 Hachijojima Bearing 185, 52 degrees. Your picture... If only they'd been evacuated... Life rarely goes as planned. I'm supposed to be a star pitcher. Hey... Hear something? Here it is. Want to see inside? Then we'll know what our mission is... Go ahead. I'll keep watch. Aren't you going? I'm doing this for you. I don't recall asking... Go on. Okay, okay... Who are you? Don't! Drop it! Enemy sighted. All hands, battle stations. Depth to 21 Distance 6 to 8,000. Down scope. They know our position. Do we wait it out on the bottom? There's no time. Okay, let's give Lorelei a try. But... We must test the ship's potential. Unless you have an objection? Release the mini-sub. Pilots please board. Pfc Origasa to the mini-sub. Private, do you hear me? I'm already on board. It handles much the same as the suicide torpedo. But the controls are more sensitive. Yes, Sir, but... Maintain 80m separation to avoid collision. The mini-sub's fragile... Take care when you detach. Are you ready to launch? Yes. Start launch procedure. Flood access tube. Get to your post! Standby power on. Starting up. Check access hatch. Commence launch. Rudder controls released. Restraints away. Distance 75... 80m. Stopping power. Maintain distance. Maximum amplification. Engage Lorelei. All hands, stand by. Lorelei pinpoints every ship in the sea. Lets us pick them off, one by one. This is the surrounding seascape. How far can it see? In normal conditions, 120 miles. Bearing 210, 5,500 meters... Three destroyers. Heading the same way? Unbelievable... direction AND range... Sonar, check bearing 210... Searching... Three of them. Probably destroyers. Exactly right. Same bearing... closing in. Let's strike first. Battle stations. We're under orders not to fight. We're too close to run. - We have few torpedoes... - Who said I'd use them? Maintain depth. Seal watertight doors. Gunnery Chief to Fire Command. All set here. They're bearing line astern. If we hit the lead ship The others collide with her. Taking out all three? If your data is accurate. Bridge to Fire Command... Are you ready? Ready to fire, sir! We have exact coordinates. Hit it first time. Torpedoes in the water. Six of them! Hard starboard. Head straight for them. Hard starboard, full ahead! First wave at 180m... Main ballast, partial bleed... Slight left rudder. Once they pass, dip slightly. Slight left rudder! Down elevator. Blow main tanks! All up. To the surface! Blow main tanks! All up. To the surface! We're at the surface. Gunnery Chief, adjust aim... 2 left... 1 down... Open fire. Fire! We're diving. Seal the muzzles. Target hit. Sounds of collision. Only one collision? Just one. The lead ship dodged the shell. Pretty impressive. What happened? Enemy approaching! Fix it. Diving planes full descent. As deep as she'll go. We're past safe limits... Depth charges in the water! How's the Lorelei? We can't go deeper. Gentle feed tanks 1 to 4. Engage auto-level. Silent cruise mode. The bastards are still on us. and closing. Straight to us. Signal strength 3... Directly above. Depth charges! Brace yourselves, here they come! Ahead, slow. Bearing 030. Enemy receding to port. Stay calm, move out slowly. Propeller noise continuing to fade. Everyone okay? What chance of repairing the Lorelei system? Tell us how it all works. What are you hiding? The core of the Lorelei system... is a human being. A human? Take a look. She's had countless injections... Is she Japanese? She came from Germany with the ship That rumor of Nazi human modification was for real? It sounds incredible but... they harnessed some latent ability. Like bats and dolphins able to navigate with internal sonar... She senses emotional disruption? Maybe we have a hidden ability which emerges under certain conditions. It's speculation but... maybe she senses other psyches through the water then the Lorelei system amplifies it. Every time we hit the enemy she passes out and the system shuts down. A fragile core to a powerful weapon. Keep it secret. She's not to be seen. Permission to speak, Sir. What? Allow me to ram the enemy. Mind your manners. For my family's sake let me strike the Americans. No suicide missions from my ship. She almost died right in front of me! It's a human weapon, just like a manned torpedo! Private. Time to punish your insubordination. Shall I make him watch the girl? Good idea. I'm here to fight. How could I face my late brother? Do your job as best you can. That's how we respect the fallen. Captain! Do you know why he has no stopwatch? He relies on that wristwatch? It's a memento from his late wife. That's the kind of man he is. Trust him. Who lives here? A man trying to avoid war at all costs. August 8th 10:00- Outskirts of Tokyo A man trying to avoid war at all costs. Nishimiya, Ambassador to the US? He's still talking peace to them. Why are we here? He's always been close to Asakura. Sorry, but husband flies to Manila soon... Manila? To make peace...? You helped Capt. Asakura study in the US. Cultivating the young builds a strong nation. Asakura loved his country. Full of hope... an upright and pure man. I introduced him to many outstanding young people in the US. I thought him fit to lead our country one day. Pardon the interruption. This arrived for you. It's from Mr. Asakura... Asakura? For my nation's sake I resolve to commit hara-kiri. Everything's ready. You still didn't eat? I know you've been through a lot. You're trapped in here. You think you'd be better off dead. But at least, eat. It's my job to make sure you do. I'll bring something else later. What now? I hear you worked in an ice-cream parlor. What's the matter? Are you okay? You've got a human side after all. Captain... Tasty. Thank you, sir. Chief made it. It's "ice cream"... You've got to eat to get well. I'll leave it here. Your family? You speak Japanese? They're dead? Yeah, it's just me, now. You think of them? I'll never forget. Captain. Last night, a guard thought he heard Morse code. Morse code? A misfit crew, a strange, new weapon... Even as a last resort, this mission doesn't feel right. Lt. Commander Masami. You've read Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment"? The story of Raskolnikov, the young man who kills a loan shark. Remember who it was he really wanted to kill? Unusual for you to be here. How is she? If only she'd eat something. Ever read this? Yes, back when I was a student. Raskolnikov, the hero, claims he didn't kill the old woman but killed himself. Why did he say that? "Deicide"...killing God? Deicide? He broke the Sixth Commandment and thus killed God within himself. God in himself... Killing himself at the same time. Suicide, huh? Killing God and himself... August 9th, 02:48 - Tinian Base USAF B-29 Superfortress "Boxcar" Kazan Archipelago What are you doing? You had me scared. No wonder, being trapped in here. Give me a second... This is your Captain. In two days we reach our objective. First we surface to overhaul the guns. Those with spare time, steel yourselves for our final battle. May I... ask your name? Paula. Paula... Atsuko Ebner. Atsuko? Grandma was Japanese. Is that right? I'm Yukito Origasa. Yukito... If we make it back to Japan, come see my hometown. It's a port town with huge shipyards. Western buildings, churches... There's a streetcar. Long stone stairways... lead to my secret spot. The crew have settled in. Damn Origasa... Amid a world made mad by war her gentle voice, so pure and serene like a shaft of sunlight in the dark water brought them a moment of solace. You want a drink, too? How the hell can it drink? It's a Leica. You like photography? Yes. I wanted to be a photographer. Really? Pick it up if you like. Lieutenant... You have a daughter, right? Unlike me, she's a beauty. This is her cat's cradle. She begged me to take it. I just saw a jumble of string. But she taught me... to make a bridge. I hope we can leave them a better world. I forgot... emotional talk is taboo. I'll make Origasa scrub toilets as punishment. Hey? What's wrong? August 9th, 11:02 Atomic Bombing of Nagasaki How's she doing? Just like before. Recovery's taking longer this time. Back to your posts. Something about war... or death seems to overwhelm her... paralyzing her nervous system... She sensed some massive conflict somewhere? It's just speculation... I'll go get her some water. What is it? Aren't you on toilet duty? I am indeed, sir. But I was worried... Come in. Captain. You're still going to use her? You carry your wife's memento... ...yet you're still going to... A memento of regret, not love. I was a soldier first, husband second. My duty was foremost to my country. How could I ever make a wife happy... It's a reminder of my mistake. August 10th, 13:00 The Mariana Islands What's wrong? All hands, battle stations. Sound the alert! Alert ready. What are you doing? You bastards. Sit. Come with me. What's going on? The I-507 will rendezvous with a US destroyer and surrender to their command. What the hell? Captain Asakura's last orders. August 10th- Imperial Naval Command August 10th- Imperial Naval Command Although the Emperor made up his mind, Although the Emperor made up his mind, those Army dolts refuse to listen. No-one dare confront them... I hear Nishimiya works towards peace. If we don't agree to terms the Soviets will invade and tear our nation in half. I can't believe that... Those army blockheads! What's going on? Please be seated. I came to talk. But first let's dine. Our last supper, perhaps. As officially agreed, we give the ship to the Allies. Agreement? Yesterday, a second atom bomb fell on Nagasaki. A third will fall on Tokyo, tomorrow. What the hell are you saying? We hand over the Lorelei system. In return, they drop the bomb. Target: Tokyo. That's what we have agreed. Soon, many nations will have the atom bomb. Who'll have the upper hand then? The one with Lorelei. This sub can slip past the enemy's defenses and put an atom bomb on their doorstep. Why bomb Tokyo? It seems Captain Asakura likes you. I can count on your help, right? There are 70 of my men on this ship. You won't get far. All stations, report. Gunnery Chief, here. It's no use, sir. Gunnery Chief. We're under Lieutenant Takasu's command. You're a lieutenant? You're not in it, too! Please don't make it difficult. We share an inseparable bond. What bond? We fought in the southern islands. A meaningless campaign... Stinking jungle... Malaria... Nothing's worse than knowing your death is meaningless. We waited in vain for supplies. Starving to death, with only one option left... Captain Asakura was our savior. He went against orders and pulled us out of hell. He implored us... "Do not die. Live at all costs". Now I ask you, as our leaders, to take responsibility. That's why we're trying to end this war... My estimable Chancellor... You mean "unconditional surrender"? Then after Japan's collapse what do you intend to do? Live on as if nothing happened? You're one of us. This war took your wife. Join with us. Sadly, you refuse to see it. Send the coded reply to the Americans. We're surfacing. Bring Lorelei to the bridge. Move. Thanks for the ice-cream. Surfacing? You've no need to worry, as long as you do what we say. The Allies have guaranteed your safety after capture. Surfacing presently. All stations, report. Lorelei is secure. The B-29, loaded with its atom bomb will shortly depart Tinian base. It'll end everything so we can start anew. Not much longer. I'm disappointed. Not one of you will open your belly. This is Asakura in Naval Command. Owada Relay Station - Outside Tokyo Owada Relay Station - Outside Tokyo Signal corps. Put me through. Signal corps. Put me through. This is signal corps. Connecting to the I-507. Do it! Quick! Asakura at Naval Command. What's going on? The US destroyer is approaching. It'll arrive shortly. Captain Asakura! Lt. Commander, sorry about all this. A little dramatic, perhaps but all part of a wider plan. Do try to understand, Lt. Commander. Our country has lost its way. Now's the time to correct the error. But what's gained by torching Tokyo? Tokyo is the corrupt core. We burn out the root and allow re-growth. It makes perfect sense. And what about the innocent lives lost? Not worth the worry. All worthy people have been lost in the war. Only the cowardly dregs remain. What good can come of a world left to them? Cowards, huh? I suppose that would include us? But Captain... It takes courage to recover after being blamed and ridiculed. Maybe our country was mistaken. But we must all survive... to do our best to build a new Japan. All hands, listen! We've come this far to save our nation from atomic terror. Your families and friends... can you sit by and watch them killed? Don't give up like this! A message from the USS Fleischer: "We accept your surrender." "Welcome to the United States" Okay, let's go. Come. Paula, don't... Don't worry. They wouldn't shoot me. Is that right? Hatred can't undo the past. Don't fool yourself. Think. Shut up! What's going on? You idiot, what are you doing? Let go! Close the valves. Stop! I won't let you take her! Paula! Don't! Let's call it quits... She's just a child. Shame on us all... Gunnery Chief, here. Put down your weapons. I-507, what's going on? This is your Captain. Listen, everyone. We're back in control. We'll surface, head north and get out of here. We're going back to Japan. Captain Asakura, it's Masami. The deal is off. Things are not going to work out for you. We have Lorelei. I won't allow them to bomb Tokyo. Try to imagine Japan Adults with no responsibility nor initiative. Children with no national pride nor hope. Japan, just a nation enslaved by the US. Where's the worth in such a country? I believe in her. Even if burned to the ground... Our people will rediscover hope. Trading this girl... Sacrificing tens of thousands of lives... What kind of revival is that? I could never allow it! Noble words... but empty. A waste of my time. I never expected the plan to go perfectly. What do you mean? I have it all figured out. As long as we don't surrender, a 3rd bomb is bound to drop on Tokyo. A third bomb? I'm indebted to you and it hurts to know you'll die. Mr. Tsuchiya... We'll meet again. Masami, noble words won't get you very far, now. You'll have to deploy the suicide tactics you so despise. It's inevitable. I'm sorry I won't get to see it. You don't mean... Captain! Beat this, you cowards. This marks the start of a new Japan. Captain Asakura! What's going on there? Both engines stop. Head for the airfield! Someone's trying to stop Nishimiya making peace. Hurry! Ambassador Nishimiya? We were too late. For what? Tokyo will be wiped out by an atom bomb. When will the bomb depart? Can you take his word? When will the B-29 take off? It's no use. Don't dream you can defeat... ...the US Pacific fleet. Tell me! Tinian Base, North Field... How dare you, you witch... Only 15 more hours... It's too far-fetched to believe without proof. The mission might not even go ahead. The Mariana Islands- Tinian USAF 509th Composite Group Tinian Base - North Field With Japan's rejection of unconditional surrender, a third attack is planned. Among the designated targets, top priority is... Tokyo. May I come in? Asakura defied high command so his orders are invalid. We've lost contact with base. Returning home would not be unreasonable. That may be right. However... We bought this on the Ginza... Tokyo's full of memories of her. She's no longer with me but what we shared sustains me even now. I'll defend it with my very life. I feel the same. It's a personal matter. You don't have to get involved. We've shared destiny since Pearl Harbor. Let's go out with a bang. This is your Captain. We're going to break through the US defensive cordon and attack Tinian. We'll shell the airfield and stop the atom bomb in its tracks. However... Stay still. We're not operating under orders from H.Q. It's a voluntary mission. This war is nearly over. I don't know if Asakura's prediction will come true or not. All I know, is that we can't stand by while an atom bomb is dropped on Tokyo. I won't force this mission on you. Come forward if you wish to opt out. Rebuilding our nation is also a worthy mission. Survival brings its own duties. Each man must think. Decide for himself. That's all. Engine room, here. I'll go. I'm the only one who's seen Tinian. I remember the layout, the undersea topography, too. Good man... Medical room, too. Stern launch crew will go. Torpedo loaders, count us in. Maintenance, too. Generator room, we'll go. Me, too. What the hell... as you wish. Heck. Me too, I guess. What have you been fighting for? I never gave it any thought. Never? Isn't there something? You? For my country. Me... I just like singing... As long as I'm alive, I can sing. That's it. What is it? Please take me, too. One thing... About Paula... She's different. We should let her off. Plot this course. Captain? We need Lorelei for this mission to succeed. But it breaks down... Don't give up on her. Paula... You're taking me to Japan? That's if we survive... Don't give up on me. You're leaving, too? Sorry. I'm just so scared. Take this. I want someone to appreciate it. Make your future with it. Salute. I didn't think so many would leave. They're our hope for the future. The 25 men who departed headed for a Japanese-held island and made it safely back to Japan. and made it safely back to Japan. August 11th Tokyo 2 hours, 30 minutes to target plane's departure. Sorry to keep you waiting. A car's ready to take you. Maybe we're already too late... The Mariana Islands- Tinian Take her down! All hands, battle stations! We're heading straight for their perimeter We have to be fast. Give it all you've got. Via the shallows is quickest. We can't maintain any depth. Safer to go through the trench. I know that. It'd take too long. Plot the shortest course. 1 hour, 20 minutes to target plane's departure Entering the shallows. Hug the sea bed. Many destroyers passing overhead. It's strangely quiet. They want the Lorelei intact. It could be easily salvaged here. Another fleet ahead! Rear fleet closing... Forward fleet turning to us. A pincer move... Multiple charges from the fleet ahead. The new patterned charge... One hits and triggers the rest. Defensive positions. Evasive action, full speed. Dive planes, full ahead. Fractures to ballast pipes! All stations, damage report. Flooding in no. 4 ballast. Aft launch area, fighting leaks! Nothing wrong, here. All clear. Let's check the mini-sub. Ship's stores flooding. Seal it and get pumping. Broken pipe in bow quarters. What's going on topside? Vibrations aren't subsiding. The sonar's useless here. Are you going? Sure. I can't let her go. Mini-sub to bridge. Superficial damage. Okay for launch. Forget it. The mini-sub's no use on its own. I... will go... Paula, stay there. I'll go. Can you? Deploy Lorelei, to evade the depth charges. Paula, board the mini-sub. Origasa, how is it? All systems normal. Flood the access tube. Origasa! Kiyonaga? What the hell are you doing? Goddamn. My arm's stuck! Stop the flooding. I'm going to help. Origasa. Don't leave your post. I've got to help him. Enemy ahead. Distance 40 and closing. We won't be able to get away. We must continue in order to deploy the mini-sub. 20 meters, 10... enemy overhead. They've dropped charges. Origasa, go back. What about Kiyonaga? I said go back. But Captain! Are you trying to sink us? Origasa... Go. Get out! Get out! Flood it. Resume flooding. Detach the mini-sub. Keep your mind on the job. Repay our debt to him. Captain... Engage Lorelei. Full left rudder! We dodged the first salvo. Enemy ahead, line abreast. How many are they? 25 minutes to target plane's departure We must counter attack. Ready tubes 1 through 4. Target the lead fleet. Wait a minute. It might kill Paula, too. We have a plan. Flood tubes 1 and 2. Fire! You removed the fuses... Disabling, not sinking them... Minimizing Paula's agony. But she suffers anyway. Is Paula alright? I don't know... I can still go on. Be strong, my dear... Engine, give us full power. It won't be enough! Full revs! Full revs in a dive? Insanity. Chief. What? We can do it. Really? Well done. Cap'n, we can do it! Owada Relay Station Signals from the Marianas... Radio traffic around Tinian increasing this past hour. Something to do with Asakura? Maybe it's code? I keep hearing the word "Lorelei"... 15 minutes to target plane's departure No. 5 and 7, direct hit. No. 8, on target, too. That's all our torpedoes gone. All ships in our path taken care of. Keep your guard up. Torpedoes off port bow! What? Hard to port! All stations, report. Main circuits, no power. Switch to auxiliary power. We're in bad shape, Cap'n. Battery room hydrogen level is soaring. Damaged batteries, huh? Blow main ballast. No good. Start the engines. It's impossible... without reconnecting main power. Switch out the bad battery by hand? If we could access the battery room. Forget it. You'd never survive. Captain... They've stopped. We're sitting ducks. I hear 1, 2, 3, 4 charges dropping! Power restored. Kizaki! Kizaki! Blow main ballast! Into reverse! Listen up, both of you. It's our last chance. We'll use your torpedoes. They're armed. What'll happen to Paula? I'll be okay. If you're by my side. Mini-sub, prepare to fire. Origasa... Paula... We're counting on you. Dive planes up. Fire! We did it. They think we're sunk. Let's go save Tokyo! I'm okay. I'm okay. Request permission to dock for Paula's sake. Captain? Can you hear me? Prepare to discard mini-sub. We will not dock. What's going on? Mini-sub crew, leave the combat zone. Find your own way home and to the future. Out. Please take us with you. It's not fair. Don't abandon us. It's our responsibility from here. We older generation started this war. Yet we relied on you youngsters to do the fighting. I apologize. We left things up to chance. Didn't know how else to live. But you're different. Decide for yourselves what's truly important. Then cherish it with all your heart. Truly important? Think. You'll know it when you find it. Yukito... Look. Look after her, Origasa. Captain! Release. Those are my final orders. Captain! Cut the umbilical. Full speed ahead! Paula's singing. She was a lovely kid. Live, Paula... 2 minutes before take-off Here we are at last. It's all in your hands. When this is over drinks are on me. I know a great girl with a nice bar in Ginza. Surfacing into position. Time remaining... 11 seconds... 10... 9... 8 Open fire! This is your Captain. We're setting course for home. Let's go, boys. No-one knows what happened to them. One thing is certain, though... They sacrificed everything to protect what they cherished. Kennedy Taylor & Cellin Gluck
