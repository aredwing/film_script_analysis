My new parishioners are waiting. Yes, yes. I know. Mrs. Moriarty ... Would you check the windows upstairs? It's a bit chilly, isn't it? Yes, Father. You don't suppose a Red has a soul, do you Father? I'm ready. Who are you? What do you want? Who are you? Oh, my god. Overcast skies today folks with an expected high of 55 degrees and some showers expected later in the afternoon. Then don't forget those sweaters and umbrellas. Should be clearing later in the day with only a 30 percent chance ... - Hey, I wanna catch the weather. Weather report for the Try county area ... - Eighteen and cloudy and cold. I don't hear anything about it being hot there. If we hit the rush, we'll miss the agent. He's gonna be there nine o'clock, sharp. I'm hurrying. To the place in Amityville we gotta take Long Island expressway. ... percent chance of rain. The long range forecast calls for a continuation of this chilly weather. The low pressure range coming... This is Amityville. The houses is about a mile away on the other side of town. - Marvin ... turn right after the bridge. - What? Right ... here. Turn it, Marvin. This is ridiculous. What is it, Debbie? Another one of your premonitions? Stop. What? What is it? I know this house. - This isn't even the right block. Marvin ... It's for sale. Hey ... I smell an opportunity. I know this house. Look at the size of this place. It's enormous. I wonder how much they want for it. I know this house, Marvin. - We have to get some partners, who have some money. Bill ... - You never listen to me, Marvin. - Bill's making money with his restaurant. And Abby ... Abby just married a lawyer, didn't she, Debbie? Of course I'm gonna have to handle that deal. And market it so high on Long Island like that? We can ... we can just fixed up and ... and advertise that on Manhattan. I've seen this house before ... in a dream. You have some little fixer upper, huh? So this is Amityville. Hey, Marv. There must be something wrong with this place, huh? Some minor repairs. Nothing a little elbow grease won't cure. How'd we get it so cheap, Marvin? Well, negotiating. Pure and simple. But, it's more like psychological torture. Hey, Abby when's the big unveiling? No, wait a minute I'm not finished with it yet. I'm gonna work on it this weekend. You're gonna paint? When I'm not renovating. Oh, don't tell me a minor repair job, Marvin. A welcoming gift. - From who? So ... what do you think? You're sure someone's not still living in here? - Look at this furniture. All part of the deal. Even the curtains. Marvin, will you help us, please? Listen to me, Bill. Hey, where's the easel. Where's Debbie? What do you think, sweetheart? Your money ... Yeah, mine too. Now I'd like to get a better look at what I bought into Called county in myself just a week ago. It must be a bad switch. Need power for this thing, Marvin. - Yeah, Marvin. How brilliant are you with negotiating with the powers of darkness. Very funny. Anybody got a flashlight? Look, what I found. Ask and you shall receive. This is great furniture. - I told you it's a bargain. Why's it all covered up? Marvin, this is kind of weird. Who's that? It's your wife, Marvin. - Debbie! In here! I'm in the kitchen! Careful. This place bites. - Are you okay, honey? - I thought I heard something. I'm sorry. At least it's not broken. - We should get an x-ray. - No. It's just twisted, I'll be all right. - Deborah. - She'll be fine, Marvin. I've got bandages in the first aid kit. I can use one of your pain killers, can I, Marvin? Oh, boy. What a start to a little pain and plaster party. Great house you found us, Marvin. You never did explain why they moved out. - What? A family who lived here. Look at this. They left their furniture and everything. They must have left in a hurry. It's really strange, isn't it? I think they were superstitious. I played a lot on the negotiations. I think they just wanted to get rid of the house. Things are usually cheap for a reason. I volunteered for this. This doesn't make sense. What's going on down there? There's no water pressure, Marvin. What is it, Marvin? - What? Smells like something crawled in there and died. That's the third cigarette in a row. Last I heard you, you were gonna quit. That's right. Okay. What's that? Don't move. Don't. No, don't. - What're you doing? We got water, William. Rust. Definitely not my colour. Oh, baby. We ready to read Bill's fortune. Don't you think this is a little childish? Where's the fortune cookies? There are in the chow mien. So ... What does mine say? Okay. Something about surprises. Expect the unexpected. That counts. Don't you think, Marv? It's the law of averages. They print the same fortunes five times over. Don't encourage her. - Hey. I've got something here ... that no one expected. You've got a mag. That was a gorgeous dress. Let's see what we're wearing on the dance floor. Hey, speak for yourself Billy Boy. I happen to be ... a great dancer. It has to do with a ... party language. There is no mistaking what it's saying now. I forget. I sense a lesson in behavioural science coming up. Hey, okay. We really should ease up on Marvin here. You know if it worked for him ... we wouldn't have the pleasure of being the symboliser tonight. in our fabulous house in need of ... minor repairs. I heard there's a Holiday Inn down the road, you're welcome to stay there. And miss all this fun? Mark me now, thank me later. My mother used to say that. My mother never said anything. Daddy wouldn't give her a chance. Hey, there's a scratching sound. I told you ... rats. Big ones. Excuse me. I have to go to the bathroom. Hey, you've better take this. Remember at the wedding we tried to fool my mother into thinking she was Jewish? Oh, come on guys. I'm still hungry. Let's get desert. Okay. Kitty? How about you, Frank? You've been quiet over there. Where'd you grow up? Around. I moved around a lot when I was a teenager. - No, before that. I mean. Your formative years. No telling dramas of parents and puberty. - That past it's just a dream. Doesn't exist anymore. I understand that. It's called selective memory. You block out problems from childhood. I've seen lot of cases like that. - Let's just say my past was not worth the memory. Kitty? There's one left. Must be yours, Marvin. There's nothing there. Well, the man with no future meet ... the man with no past. - Yes. It's very true, that's just spectacular, Bill. On the other hand, Marvin. You're a humorous individual. Afraid of the dark. This is silly. There is a cat in the basement. This place is ... full of surprises. Well ... how about a toast everybody ... to love ... everlasting? To the newlyweds. Any children in the future Deb. - William. To good friends. To doubling our money. To the house. To the house. Oh, my god, Abby. It doesn't even hurt. Oh, god Billy, please ... be careful. - Careful, Bill. - Okay, okay. Just hold it. Marvin, where are those famous pain killers of yours? I know it's a sin ...  I've got you.  How's your hand, Abby? It still hurts a bit. But you can make it feel better. You know, I think we should move to the Holiday Inn. Oh, no baby. It's romantic here. You will get the power going, first thing in the morning. Besides ... I don't need a furnace to keep me warm. One ... Two ... Three. Hallelujah ...  Hallelujah. Hallelujah.  Now I know why he's never got married. Classic anal retentive. What do you think I heard, Marvin? What? Marvin? You're not listening to me. The doctor is in. It's just a feeling. I don't know what. I think there's something else in the house. You're sure this is one of your ESPM premonitions again, or is it just a dream? - I swear ... I heard a voice coming from the basement. It was like a strange ... - It's probably the cat making a noise. Debra, look ... you've hurt yourself, you've been under a lot of stress, you're taking medication, we're in the strange place. You don't understand. I don't think you want to. We've been through this before. Are you... are you keeping the journal I asked you to keep? I mean, don't you ... see some pattern in this? You're with your friends here, Debra. Believe me you're safe in this house. Kitty. Come on. Calm down. Stop it right now. Just, just take a deep breath. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Okay, that's right. Right, right. There's something evil in this house! - Debbie, write it down. Somebody try the power! There is nothing! Oh, goddamn! Try again! There's still nothing! Marvin? Are you all right? Beside from the fact that you could have killed me, huh? What's going on? - I almost nailed Marvin. Don't you know how to use that thing!? I don't see how I could have missed. Maybe I just need a bit more practice. Hey, everybody. Check this out. What is it? You tell me. It's so ... like that. No. No way that thing's staying here. I don't know. Just might make the house show better. Maybe I should put it in your bedroom. A feeler ... with visions. Yes. Yes. - Pardon me? - Can we help you? Oh, I'm not the one that needs the help. But maybe I can help you. You're hurting, but you'll be fine. - Just, who are you? What's your name, dear? - Debbie. She's Debbie. - I know who she is, I mean who is she? - Oh, yeah, Moriarty, Mrs. Moriarty. That's two r's and one i. It's not real, dear. It's fake. Better to keep an eye out. Hey, you got a glass here for my eye? Hey, Frank. We've got company. Someone you really ought to meet. You can't stay awake, can you? Always having to look for you when you wander off. Oh, that's good beer. I don't think they have that done in thirties. Don't think so anyway. What's up? A Dorotie's barn grill. Tonight it's a big night down there. Saturday shindig. - Just a why are you here anyways? A miracle of birth I suppose. The Lord works in mysterious ways. Weird. Certifiable. Look, Mrs. Moriarty as you can see, we've really got a lot of work to do here. - All will be revealed. I don't mean to be rude, but ... - This time for certain I can tell the Lord works in mysterious ways. See? I have something for you. I know I brought it. Well ... I've got work to do anyways. What in the hell is wrong with that dog? Frank! Get inside! Hurry! What did you do to that animal, Frank? Did you see it's size? - Is it gone? I don't see it. Oh, my god. Look, don't anybody move. - Tell that to the dog. What was that all about? I don't know. Maybe we should ... we should call that SPCA. - If we had a phone. It's over. Everybody's hungry, uh? Bill ... you got anything in that cooler besides a handful of sprouts and the dog food? I think it kills your ... your appetite, huh Marvin? What the hell? It was a stray dog pissed off by Frank's looks. That's all. Give us a smile, William. Let's see how much you're enjoying your work. Hey, watch it! That stove isn't replaceable. What about the furnace? What? - The furnace! That's Debbie's job. She's putting down the finish. Watch that stuff, it's dangerous. You missed a spot ... To your right. Marvin, you're making me nervous. Screwman! Stop screwing around, get back to work. Very funny. Very funny. So, did you get the furnace working? I just got the lights working, Marvin. I can't believe how much usable stuff there is here. This really was an incredible deal. Got you! It's one of these you know. There's probably a whole damn nest of them. - Yeah, big ones. Breeders. Marvin? There's a door here. So, what do you think is in there besides a nest of diseased rats? - I'm ready for them. - Yeah? Come on. I think, we're safe. I don't see any beady red eyes. So, why don't you ... check, to make sure there's no more rats in here? I'll go check on Deb. Marvin Swarzenegger. Damn. Marvin! Marvin! So? Now, what're you two trying to tell me? That this house has some sort of ... supernatural something, uh? Ghosts, goblins ... Come on William, I never expected that you'd fall for this sort of bogeyman garbage. Then you explain what happened, professor. Everything has an explanation. You've just got to approach the situation in a rational sort of way... and not let your imagination run away with you. Right. I imagined all that. Basement drafts plain and simple. Oh, come on. Why don't we just get out of here for a while? Have a few drinks. Yeah. I could use a couple. Almost ready? I dreamt about the religious symbols. A church ... But look at this. That was two weeks before Bill found the things in the basement. I'm telling you there's a connection. - Debbie, please not now! We need some distance, ... perspective. We'll talk about it tomorrow. I'll be downstairs. Marvin's looking for you. I don't wanna leave you alone here. - No, you go. I'm best left alone when this happens. No, I can, I can stay downstairs and work on the painting. - No, it'll pass! You, just go. At least one of us should have a good time. Okay. Bill got the fridge working and ... there is some chicken in there if you're hungry. I'll be back early. I could have sworn the guy said the term "just beyond the next life". - She found the place. Okay, Marvin? Welcome to Dorries folks. Nice to see new faces. Hi. What sort of wines do you have? Red and white. Just bring us some pitcher of Coors Light and four glasses. Miss. Where's the restroom? Second right, past the bar. I'm gonna call the Blue Goose, see if I'm still in the restaurant business. Well ... this place kinda remind you of a certain... ah... student hangout. What was the name of that place? What? Wasn't it Sullivan's or Mullagan's or something like that? Collagen's, that's it. - Yeah, we closed that place down a couple of times, didn't we? Abby? Yeah. You don't think I'm crazy, do you? No. I've got it. - Oh, no charge, ladies. Compliments from Mrs. Moriarty. You don't really think she's gonna come over here, do you? You don't like her, do you? She gives me the creeps. Well, I mean it's not that big a deal being a psychologist. I mean you ... you learn a lot about people, you ... try to help people with their problems " I do the best I can". Here's to my assistant manager ... the Blue Goose is turning down reservations. I'll be right back. Hey, Billy. Tell me something. Do you really buy into all this spirit in the house stuff, you know? No, I do not. Buy it. I know such stories are around, but while I'm here. Let me ask you. Have either of you gentlemen ... ever witnessed first hand a verifiable paranormal event. Let me put it this way. Are you familiar with mass hysteria? You're looking a mite peeked, dear. Ain't you feeling well? You scared me. I seem to have an effect on a lot of folks around here. But they had seen what I've seen. Think, my visions don't come from ... from here, you know. They come from somewhere else. - What're you talking about? In life ... he opened this house to the sinner. And in death he still compels a sinner to come. And he works through you. What is this? Hadn't that boy killed his family? He was possessed. This town is full of a lot of strange things. Is that a fact! Like that old house you and your friends bought. That old house ... is not just bricks and boards. It's got a soul in that house. What anywhere's got is a lot of town's people starting to believe their own poll tales. Plain and simple. So, who wants another beer? I'll tell you one thing plain and simple, mister. You don't know shit. Frank? Sweetheart? Where are you, sweetheart? Frank! It's come back. Knocking, then came those whispers. Don't ever leave me. Come on breathe. Just breathe and relax. - Nice cold. - It's okay. Nice cold bath. It's the only thing that use to get rid of them. I remember that as a kid. That's the only thing that I absolutely remember. Yes, I know. Don't worry, honey. I'm here now. Point - one - one. One - one - one. I just don't understand why he hurts so bad. I'm worried, Marvin. He was ... yelling and cursing all night long. I don't know what's happening to him. Migraines will do that. I know couple of specialists I can recommend. Morning. Oh, do you want some coffee? No, thanks. Maybe I'll take it when I get back from my run. Do you need anything from the Seven Eleven? I'm gonna stock up on Raid. No, as a matter of fact I was gonna go and get some fresh bagels and the Sunday Times. Is that everything you need? Is Deb all right? She seemed pretty weirded out when we got home last night. She's okay. A few minutes ago she was still sleeping. How about you? I had a rough night too. I don't like being alone up there. I could use a good woman. Well ... let me see what I can do. Does she have her own sleeping bed? One - one - one. What does that mean? Tell me! What are you trying to tell me?! Anybody home? Kitty ran away again last night. Where is everybody? Oh, I guess they heard I was coming. Kitty. Kitty, are you down here in the basement? Who's in there? Father. Father. He's here, Father. I can feel him. One - one - one. Born November first. Eleven one. Not one eleven ... one. Please, what is it? Merciful God. It's you. Please, what is it? What is it?! It's her glasses. Oh, damn. Would you mind not smoking? I'll be upstairs. Mrs. Moriarty was a church secretary when this place was a rectory. A rectory? Didn't they tell you anything when you bought this old house? I, I wasn't particularly interested at that time in the details of its history. - So ... What did they want for this old place anyway? Want a mint? No. Never got to know the new priest. Not alive anyway. You said she was here yesterday? She came by in the morning. What's this about the priest? Father Percheos. Killed ... Murdered ... in his own confessional. The priest was, was murdered here? - No, not here. In the church on the corner. Hard to believe all this stuff is still here after twelve years. Whoever did it, he was confessing his sins. Shot him point blank. Right between the eyes. Nine o'clock on the Sunday night. Can you imagine that? Archdiocese had to close the church after that. They moved what they could down here. Lots of the priest's stuff too. No family ... where ... none that we could find anyway. Some say that everything about this place is cursed. My bet is that ... old lady started that one. She ... got a bit of a loose screw after she found the body. That's funny. I know I didn't shoot the whole tape. I'll send somebody by tomorrow to bring the tape back, okay? - But I'm sure we'll be leaving today. Excuse me, sir, but a woman did die here. And we may have a couple of questions. - Krabel, I'll talk to you later, okay? - Yes, sir. About the priest ... you said ... "Whoever did it". Don't you know? Didn't you catch the killer? Well, from what Mrs. Moriarty told me, we picked up this ... half wit neighbourhood kid who was always getting trouble. And we found him hiding in that oak tree over there. Which wasn't hard to do, because fool dog was running down below. So, they did catch the killer. Well, we think so. Trouble is ... hung himself the next night before we could get a confession out of him. - No. Debra, you're not supposed to be out here. It's okay, inspector. She'll be okay. The boy ... Marvin, the ... - Are you okay, Deb? - Come on. Come on, sweetheart. It's okay. That's the boy. Debra ... it was dark, she lost her footing. She shouldn't have been in the house the first time. - She was drawn here like I was drawn here. It brought us here, Marvin. - Yes. What is it? - The house. Something about the house. It's been trying to communicate ever since we got here. Even before, in my dreams. - I won't listen to this nonsense - The church ... confession ... man ... everywhere. You are hysterical. Mrs. ... Mrs. Moriarty said it was working through me ... for justice. You have to listen to me. Something's horribly wrong here. Debra. Debbie. Where is the boy? How could I have seen him? You think you know better! He's been dead for twelve years. I'm in the tub. Is that you, Frank? You know, Marv, ... this thing really sounded like a good idea. I'd like you to look at something. It's Debbie's journal. But it's not Debbie's writing. It's been a while since I've tried to translate Latin ... best I can make out, there bits and pieces of the Bible passages. Something that looks like it's from ... an absolution ... or an exorcism. Exorcism? You know this is ... fifth commandment. "Honour Thy Father ... " You're the psychologist. What's all this mean? It means I'm losing her, Bill. I don't know what to do. You can do what I'm doing. Pack. We're getting the hell out of here. You can't just walk out like this. What's Frank gonna say? I hope you don't think I'm driving you. Not with that flat tyre, you won't. - What? Get your keys, we'll change it. Let's go, Marvin. I haven't got a spare. What the guy suppo ... He said the tyres were good. - Listen to me, Marvin. We're not staying here tonight. You got it? Look, we can take off that tyre ... and I'll borrow Bill's scooter and we gonna find some service station somewhere and we're gonna fix the damn thing. Now, you guys get everything packed. And when I'll get back ... we're gone. Understand? Well, I suppose we can come ... to work next week. Hey, man. I mean ... what's gotta happen before you open up your eyes. Were we all dreaming at the same time? Look, when I get back ... we're out of here. This house is history! Damn! Frank? Is that you? Can I help you? - I got flat tyre. That's no problem. - Thanks. Come on, let's go inside. Mrs. Moriarty? Is it you out there? I'm listening. I'm ready. Who are you? What do you want? Bless me Father ... for I have sinned. So have you, you son of a bitch. Open the door. Whoever you are, let me out of here. - Father ... why has God forsaken me? Why? Oh, my god. You abandoned us. You denied me. Your own flesh. My own father. What'd you have told mother? That you'd fill her with ... the burning love of God? That you would hold her ... and that you would never leave her. Now, listen to me my son. - How do you dare call me that!? You sinner. Sinner, sinner, sinner ...  Man of God. Poor godless child ... you don't even know my name. Oh, please. Forgive me, forgive me. Please, I'm begging you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Father? I bet you never thought I'd find you here ... after all these years ... I'm here to help you out for your sins. Keep your promise ... into eternity ... in sickness and in health. Mommy no longer lives ... Those whispers are almost over. But she needs someone. Otce nas, jenz jsi na nebesich. Posvt se jmno tv, pij krlovstv tv, bu vle ... jako v nebi, tak i na zemi. Chlb n vezdej dej nm dnes a odpus nm nae viny, jako i my odpoutme naim vinkm, a neuve ns v pokuen, ale zbav ns od zlho. Nebo tv jest Krlovstv i moc i slva a na vky vku. (Czech prayer) Amen. Nee! Instant replay. Father ... Turn it up. Father ... - Well, check this out. I didn't know there was any audio on here until ... I worked a little magic with these fingers, you know what I mean? ... it came, Father ... The prodigal come. It's you. Damn. Oh, my god. No. No! Don't leave me alone, Marvin. Don't go away. Frank. Frank? What in the name of God? What are you doing? Frank ... It's me. It's Debbie. Please, Frank. I'm your friend, Frank. Bill, help me! Bill, help me! Please. Together ... forever in eternity. Bill! Bill. We gotta get out. Bill, it's Frank. He killed Marvin. We gonna get out of here. Oh, no, Bill. Help! Somebody help! Help me! Somebody, please help me! Debbie ... Come on, guys. Let's go. Oh, my god. Frank. What've you done? Frank. ... till death ... do us part. Hey, I told you. Not until we get a handle on them. - Move along, buddy. - Listen ... if we ever do. Christ. It'll start all over again. Just in the twist they claim back too. What is that? This? Does it belong to you? No. It belongs to the house.
