Please don't tell me you're taking lessons from that Neanderthal. No. No. Good. I want us to be special. Ah-choo! That's disgusting. Hey, let's explore. Marco. Hey, what's the holdup? This sucks. Why is there traffic? What is going on? What is that? This is crazy. A spokesman released a statement ten minutes ago saying that the quarantine exercise will be for 24 hours... Charlie 1-4, this is Charlie... We have visual contact. We got reservations at 7. You mean to tell me we can't get through? This is bullshit. Bullshit. You can't do this. We're in America. Who gave the order for this exercise? Sir, my orders are to keep this road sealed off for the next 24 hours. You can take your son to the hospital in town. Those guys don't know their asses from a hole in the ground. I want to go to a real hospital. Sir, I understand. Not unless you have kids, you don't fucking understand. Honey, you're not helping. We're going to Boulder. Corporal Cross? Platoon up. You heard the man. Let's go. Let's go. Sir, I'm asking you politely. Please turn your car around. Please. Mrs. Leitner? What? Sarah, what are you doing here? Your mom told me you were never coming back. Well, you know how she exaggerates. Besides, I'm needed here. Look, I'm sorry that I yelled, but can you get us out of here? Cody is really sick. Mr. Leitner, I understand that you're upset, but the best thing that you can do for Cody right now is to get him to the medical center. The Army's brought in specialists. They're already there at the hospital. That'll be much quicker than driving to Boulder. She's right. Thank you. All right, get the rest of these cars turned around. Okay, you heard the captain. Let's get all of the cars turned around. Excuse me, sir. Sir. Did I just tell them the truth? Corporal, your orders are to keep this shit hole town-- Excuse me. Your shit hole town sealed off. Now do it. Yes, sir. Yeah, where the hell are those med 'chines? They were supposed to be here three hours ago. They haven't reported in, sir. We've got teams searching now. No. Both of them? Nina? Nina? Hello. Gotcha! Aah! I got you. Not really. Yeah, right. What'd you find? I don't know. You want to check it out? Find a cool little spot? In a dark hole? I don't think so. Hey, didn't you say something about your mother being sick with the flu? Yeah, she's in bed. You think she'd know if we were on your couch? Zip it up, Kyle. What? We're out of here. Come on. I'm not really done here. You want a ride? You're done. Your friend's a real buzz kill. Tell me about it. Oh, God. Jesus, you okay, man? Chill. It stopped. Are you my mom? Okay, okay, come on. We gotta go. Nina and I have, you know, plans. My parents aren't getting home for a couple of hours. Want to come over? Are you nuts? If you got me sick, I'll kill you. No. Come on, Kyle! Bus is leaving! Let's go! Wait! This is KSWT, broadcasting live from downtown Leadville, Colorado. So I have some travel news for all of you trying to get out of town. Route 40 will be closed until 7:30 tomorrow night. Still, they keep saying this is just an exercise. Now, Uncle Sam wouldn't be trying to lie to us, would he? No. Stay tuned for further bulletins. In the meantime, when the man gives them to me, I'll give them to you. And now, some more inane bull stuff. So, as a cog in the military industrial complex, are you capable of independent thought? Sir, my orders are to relay the information to you so you can pass it on to the public. This ain't about that flu thing, is it? So what the fuck is it about? You are gonna talk to me, so help me God. Or...Celine Dion. You probably like her. Well, hey, come on. You know, it was just my allergies. Look, I'll give you money. What? Well-- Fuck you. I'm walking home. Where'd she go? She said she needed some exercise. # Everything is all right # # Things can be as they should # # If you look after me # # The way I looked after you # We're so over, Kyle. Kyle? Aah! Whoa! Aargh! Aah! Hey, Private, why don't you be all you can be and grab them damn batteries? Can you believe they're gonna give that bitch a gun? Get this to Captain Rhodes as soon as you can. Corporal Cross. We were given orders to report to your squad. Think I'm gonna like it here. You were at Fort Bragg, right? Yes. Yeah, I heard about you. You and my homie Henry Fat was hitting it for a couple months, right? You and your homie got your wires crossed. It didn't happen. If you say so. As of now, you two are on guard duty. This is your barricade. No one gets through. You got that? Crain, you the driver? Yes, sir. Um, God. Ma'am. You up for a road trip? Yeah. No one gets through. How long we supposed to stay here? We'll try and be back before breakfast. That's, like, 12 hours! We'll bring you a bagel. Ahem. Are we really spending the night together? Not a chance. Okay, good, because that wouldn't be appropriate. He was definitely hitting that. Shut up. I-- I thought you wanted me to drive. I know the way. You just join? Really? You can tell? Yeah, seven months ago. I was studying radar and countermeasures. My first time being called out. Kind of wish it was something a little more exciting. Be careful what you wish for. I've seen exciting. You don't have to worry. Nothing really happens in this town anyway. Yeah, it seems like a real shit hole. Where are we going anyway? My house. Oh, so you're from here? Born and raised. Well, it's kind of a charming shit hole. All right, I'll be back. Listen, Crain sounds so formal. What do your friends call you? Um, my friends call me Bud. Bud. Okay. Well, when we're not around the others, you can call me Sarah. Whoo. Nothing on TV? Sarah? Haven't you heard of knocking? Uh, this is my house, too. You want privacy, find a new place. What's going on, Nina? Nothing, really. Your father still teaching Sunday school? This is so not cool. You know what, you missed a button right there. What the hell are you doing here? Enforcing the quarantine. What's up with not returning my calls? What quarantine? What calls? You're kidding me. I called your cell phone, like, five or six times. You know what? Where's Mom? In bed, I guess. You guess. I just got home. She wasn't feeling well this morning. And you didn't check on her? I check on her every day. That's a lot more than some people. Get over it, Trevor. Hey, Mom. Sarah, honey. I didn't know you were coming. I guess you were too busy to call. How are you feeling, Mom? I'm okay. No, you're not. You're burning up. Please, you have more important things to do than worry about me. What are you doing here? I'm taking you to the hospital. Don't be silly. It's just a cold. I took some vitamins. Mom, I'm taking you to the hospital, okay? Let's get you dressed. My dad's left a dozen messages. They're at the hospital. How long has Mom been sick? Since this morning. It's a cold. Everyone's got it. And when did you start caring? Don't start with me. Kyle had it really bad. His nose was gushing blood. Where is he now? Home. He found his dad's supply of medical hash. I'm gonna run over there and check on him. Wait, wait. Wait, you can't even go upstairs to check on your own mother, and now you want to go all the way across town? No. You're gonna go upstairs, make sure Mom gets dressed, and don't leave until I get back. Do you think you can handle that? I'll go check on Kyle. Aye-aye, Admiral Bitch. Everything okay? No, it's not. Kyle. Anybody here? Oh, shit. Don't worry. It's not loaded. Oh, my God. What the hell happened here? Aah! Fuck! Fuck! Uhh! Oh! What's there? The phone is dead. Fuck. Oh, God. I don't have any service. Yeah. Come on. Let's go. Fitzsimmons, The boy Kyle is missing. The bodies look like they were mauled by something. I couldn't call the police. All the phones are dead. Over. Yes, I know, Corporal. We're blocking all phone lines until we get control of the situation. Got a whole lot of wild rumors running around here. I'll get that info to the police. Where are you? I need to take my mother to the hospital, Sir. Well, I'm headed over there right now to see if I can find some missing doctors. You get back to that roadblock ASAP. Yes, sir. Over and out. Why isn't your gun loaded? It's complicated. Cool. I'm a vegetarian, by the way. Maybe we should just keep that between us. Was Kyle stoned? He wasn't there. Did his parents know where he was? No. Oh, oh. I'm bleeding. There's gauze in the kit. All right. Here, here, I got it. Here, tilt your head back. Careful. You got it? So when are you going back to Denver? Park it and meet us inside. Yes, Ma'am. Slow down! Oh! Jerk! Excuse me, ma'am, my mom needs a doctor. Yeah, her and everyone else. Look, here. Just write her name on the list, and we'll get to her. I-I can't wait. Listen, lady, half the town's sick. We're overwhelmed and understaffed. Just write her name down on the list. Mom... look, they're a bit overwhelmed, okay? We're going to have to wait. What? Do you mind? I found my mom and dad. They're in a room, waiting for the doctor. You want to come with? Yeah. I'll be right back. Trevor, wait! Stay here. Salazar, you're supposed to be on guard duty. Williams and Elders have it covered. Captain had me come with him. You know the phone lines are down. The cell phones aren't even working. I heard it was orders from Washington. You think this is still just an exercise? Nah. There's some real serious shit going down. Corporal Cross. Sir. There's a doctor here from the CDC. He wants to ask you about the bodies at Cypress Pond. He was annoyingly insistent. Sarah's great, huh? I wish she were around more. Um, does she have a boyfriend? She's hot, huh? Oh, she's so hot. You think she'd ever go out with a private? Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm a little bit-- Are you all right? Oh, my God. You're freezing. I need some help over here! Come on, man. Stay with me. Talk to me, talk to me. Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me. Um... Okay, um, Mrs. Cross, I'm going to go get Sarah. Okay? Corporal Cross! It has to be airborne. But once in the blood, it mutates faster than anything else-- Dr. Logan, this is Corporal Cross. Thanks for coming. Can you give us a minute? I find people speak more freely without a superior officer around. I'll be outside. You've had quite a night. You could say that. About the bodies, you said they looked like they were mauled. Could it have been an animal attack? If an animal can hide a body in a closet. The son is missing? Yes. Did the wounds look like bite marks? What? It's a simple question. How would I know? Maybe it's the avian flu. Don't say that. Dad, seriously, that's so not possible. I heard about this case in France where-- Dad? Daddy, what's wrong? Dad? Daddy? What's going on? Daddy? Dad! Dad? Okay, we-- we really need a doctor. Aah! Aah! Raah! Aah! Sir? Sir? Corporal, you gotta come to the waiting room. Something's happening. To my mom? To everybody. What is it? Something bad. I don't know. Hey, I thought you guys left hours ago. What the-- No! No! No! Oh! Aah! Aah! Oh, my God! Anybody! So this chick takes her top off, right? And I swear to God-- What the-- Now this here's just a little too much for this cowboy. Now, you see this button here? You press it, and you talk into that if you've got something to say to the folks because my shift has now ended, and I am going to mosey on home. Or not. Hey, where the hell are you going? Hey, I thought you said there were two bodies. Yeah. Now there's three. Show me. Freeze! Oh! Are you sure this is a good idea? Hey, maybe you shouldn't go down there! Huh? Aah! Aah! What the fuck? What the fuck? Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Come on, come on, come on. Go, go, go, go. God! Aah! Oh, my God! Aah! Aah! No, no, no, no! No! No! Here they come! Aah! What the fuck was that? Let me in! Come on. Come on. What the hell? What the hell is happening to these people? I don't know. Where's the basement? Right there. My mom's in there. We'll go undercover. That's an order, Corporal! Come on! Here. We're safe! Grrr! Aah! What the hell was that? You almost got me killed. What do you mean? What are you talking about? Bud! Help me. Oh, my God. What are we going to do? Aah! Aah! Fuck! Come on. Aah! Look at the radio station. Look, there's somebody in there. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. We're going to make it, okay? I swear. We can make Molotov cocktails. Great, and I'll just build a bus and drive us out of here. Come on, we have weapons. I don't have a gun. What? I'm in communications. We aren't issued weapons. So basically you're useless. Shut up, Logan. Come on. You've got one. We can shoot enough of them. It's not loaded. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. What the hell kind of soldier are you? You don't want to find out right now, okay? Bud, where did you park the Humvee? The lot was full, so l-- Oh, shit. They must have come out when I was-- Great. A driver without keys and a soldier without bullets. It must be my fucking birthday. What's with you two? You know what? It's complicated, okay, pal? How did you get here? Taxi. Great. Well, you're nominated to go out and hail us another one. Captain Rhodes' Humvee. He should have the keys on him. We've got to go get them. What? No! No. No way! Those things are everywhere. Not everywhere. Come on. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Hello. Hello. Hello, hello, hello! Somebody. Hello! Hello? Stop pounding. Look! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Shh! Oh, God, I'm gonna die! Open the damn door! Grrr! Open the door now! Open up! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Open the door! Someone help! Someone open the door! Oh, God! Hurry! Hurry! Are you one of them? No! Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. You better not be! Mr. and Mrs. Leitner. Oh, you're all right. Where's Cody? Is he okay? Is he-- We wanted to get Cody to a doctor, but your sister wouldn't let us, and now he's dead. Andrew, stop it! My cough-- I had it before all this. I'm not sick. Come on. Jesus. Raah! Sweet mother of God! Don't-- Yuck! God. Do you want me to go? Yeah. But I outrank you. Okay. Salazar. Are you all right? Not if you keep karate kicking me. How did you get away? When everybody started tripping, I just jumped in the closet. Keep laughing, bitch. All right, I'm taking Rhodes' Humvee. Oh, man. You won't be needing this. I got 'em. Let's go. Correct, my shit. Uhh! Go. Grrr! No! What? What happened? What is it? Aah! Give me some room! Go! Come on! He's got me! Grrr! Stop! Pull! Let's go! Come on! Go! Aah! Aah! Catch! Come on! Pull! Tell me you remembered the keys. Raah! Aah! God! God! Ah, fuck, he got me. Oh, fuck, he got me. Oh, fuck, he got me. He got me. I'm sorry. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, fuck! This is gonna be quick. No, no! You saw what happened to Rhodes when he got bit, okay? This is the only way. I put bleach on it. Shut up! Put the gun down. That's an order. I don't know if you noticed, but there's people out there eating each other, okay? So fuck you and your orders. I said shut up! What are you going to do? You going to shoot me? Hey, look, Rhodes was bitten hundreds of times, him once. Besides, bleach kills just about everything. Who the fuck are you? Look, I'm a doctor, okay? I know exactly what's-- Man, ain't nobody trying to hear that CSI bullshit. He gotta go. Didn't I say shut the fuck up? Sir. Look, I will take responsibility for him. And if the time comes, I'll do what has to be done, okay? So just back down! Look, I ain't got time for this bullshit. We need to figure out how to get the fuck out of here. I'm watching. My eye's on you! Call the police, the National Guard, and if by any slim chance the fucking FCC are listening, they might take notice. I gotta take a break. This fucking blood pressure's killing me. I shouldn't have done that kumquat diet. It's probably too late to stop smoking. I'm the one who should be worried. Your wife's been hacking up a storm since you got here. What are you trying to say? Can I give this a try? Hey, you got a license? No. Me, neither. I ain't got a fucking license. If anyone's there-- You go, kid. If anyone can hear this, we are trapped at the radio station KXWT on Elm Street in Leadville, Colorado. Uh, uh, we are under attack. Repeat. We are under attack. If anyone is there at all-- ... we need help. Okay? Something 's happening. People are going out of their minds. Please, please, please, send help. There's five of us here. It's me, my girlfriend Nina, Mr. and Mrs. Leitner, and the DJ. Just somebody send something, okay? We're at the radio station KXWT on Elm Street. Oh, oh, and if you hear my voice, do not go to the Pine Valley Hospital. Okay? It's not safe there. Repeat. Do not go to the hospital. We should go now. Okay. Take this and give me one of your guns. What, you little Miss MacGyver now? That shit ain't gonna work. Give me one of your guns. If something happens to you, we can't risk losing both of them. I know how to shoot one of those. I bet you do. Sweet spear. You see a black man with a sharp stick and it's supposed to be a spear? Oh, no, that's not what l-- Bud, can you throw this chair through the window? Yeah. Do you have your lighter? Yeah. Let's do this. Are you ready? Yeah. Okay...Now! You gotta shoot them in the head. Raah! Oh, my God! Jesus! Oh, my God. Let's go, Doc! Watch out! Shit! Watch out! Oh, shit. Let's go. Please help me. I'll help you. Aah! Come on, y'all! I got him! I'm out. Me, too. Shit. Where's Logan? What a dick. There's more of these motherfuckers? Light 'em. Come on. Okay. Oh, shit! That worked. Yeah. Behind you! Nice shot. It was kinda gangsta, huh? We gotta get some more ammo. Hang on. This is bullshit. Hey, yo, Gomer. Don't give up, man. Yeah, I won't. Shit! What you dodging them for? Run their ass over. They're still somebody. Not anymore. That was kinda fun. That is unbelievable. We have to get out of here. Do you have a car? No, I ain't going out there. Hey, dude, if you're feeling lucky, you go for it. I'd be like prime rib to those fuckers. I'm sitting my fat ass right here till the help comes. Let's just wait. Somebody will come. They have to. So which one of you had the nosebleed? What? You heard her. Anybody have a nosebleed? Just sit down and answer the question. What is wrong with you? Nina, put that down. What are you doing? Everyone who changed had a nosebleed. Who's lying? Had to be one of them. I said sit down. Hey, you don't wanna eat this. Major indigestion. She hasn't had a nosebleed, and neither have l. Look at them. They're covered in blood. Shut up! My son attacked a nurse. It's her blood! Hey, check them for bite marks. No one's touching my wife. Just answer the fucking question! Don't you get it? Someone in here is infected. We're all in danger. All right. Let's make this quick. What about your boy back here? Bud, I'm sorry. No, no. I understand. You all right? Yeah. Do me a favor. Yeah. Anything. Grab me a gun, too, and, um, load mine. Yeah, that's the type of shit I'm talking about. Ooh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Fucking tell us. Yeah. Now, just-- Ah... choo! Oh, God. You scared me. Paul? Get off the couch! Okay. Is anyone alive out there? Can anyone hear me? Anyone? Anyone? The police? Someone? We just need someone. Something's fucking happened. We need someone. Please, anyone. Don't think they know who they fucking with. Automatics have no firepower. Oh, yeah? Says who? This shit right here was made for me. Uh-huh. Whoo. By the power of Grayskull. Okay. Yeah. Stop fucking around and start loading the stuff up. How long you gonna keep cussing at me? You see this? This is a machete. Unappreciative ass. See if I save your ass again. Oh, shit. No! He's restrained. What if he gets loose? Then I'll shoot him. Look, I'm not riding with this motherfucker. Yes! Shut the fuck up! My, God, he listened. Sales of new homes rose-- Plus, with pop-- Ever since day one-- I don't understand. They're not saying anything about this. Word hasn't gotten out yet. ... the Army, the National Guard, anyone with weapons... Oh, my God. Is anyone still alive? What the hell are you doing? Out of town is the other way. That's my brother. Your brother's a DJ? Just send someone. We're being attacked. We need help. We need help now. Damn it, where the fuck is the cavalry? What are you doing? Oh, my God. Mom! Trevor! I have to let her in! Trevor, wait! Oh, shit! That's what I'm talking about! Run their ass over! Now you're driving. Wait! Wait! She could be infected! No! Why'd you lie about the nosebleed? Don't worry. It'll be fine. I promise. Mom! Trevor! Aah! Oh, God. Trevor. Trevor, it wasn't her. Not anymore. Nina, is there anybody else up there? Yes. Bring them down. We're getting out of here. We are? Go! Okay. Okay. Okay. Mr. and Mrs. Leitner, we've been rescued. Come on. It's time to go. Mr. and Mrs. Leitner? No! Raah! Aah! Trevor, I'm sorry. Yo, survivors. Hello! Come on. It's soldiers. Come on! Aah! Nina! Hey! Quick, get over here. Come on, man. They're coming, man. Hurry up. They're coming! Aah! Oh, no! Oh, no! We need to leave. Let's go! This shit is ridiculous. I mean, why Thriller over here ain't trying to eat us? He's a vegetarian. That's the best explanation you can come up with? You got a better one? All I'm saying, as long as he don't try to mistake me for a soybean burger, we gonna be all right. They seem to retain some part of themselves before they were infected. Must've retained his hormones because he definitely remembers who you are. Guess that also means he remembers who was boss, huh, bitch? Bad soldier. Ten hut! That's some crazy-ass shit. Williams, Captain Rhodes is down. Do you have any idea where-- Check if the SATCOM's working. Come on. Let's go! Let's get out of here! Whoo! Them fools were shooting at me! What we taking, a back road out of here? There is no back road. Sarah, go up Hidden Lake Road. We could get to Boulder on the fire road. Yeah, you're right. Good thinking. Okay, hold on. Hey. You okay? Remember I said we're gonna make it? We are. Never going back, are we? I don't know, Trevor. You know, why did you leave in the first place instead of opening the bike shop? You think I was gonna wait around for you to get your shit together? Who built the first bike? That broke and almost killed me when we were, like, Could y'all save that shit for Oprah, please? What the fuck was that? Kyle. Come on, get out! What's happening, player? At ease, soldier. All right. Kyle. Is there any reason why we're keeping this bitch around? Everyone grab as much firepower as you can. Look at that shit. He likes you. Got a little zombie crush. We need to find cover, some place we an defend. The old Nike site's about a mile from here. Yeah, you're right, we can hole up there, wait for daylight. Good call. All right, we're gonna keep Bud with us. Why? He might be useful against them. And he follows orders. I like that. But if he tries anything... Head shot. Yeah, come on, Mr. Follows Orders. About face! Oh, my-- Forward march! What was that? I don't know, but be ready for anything. Let's move out! Come on, let's go. Have a seat. What the hell you looking at? I know you're not looking at her ass. I think ol' Gomer over here wants-- Grrr! Salazar, leave him alone! Trevor. Good idea. I'll lead with this. Don't count on me. Look, you wanna drop the passive aggressive bullshit for once, please? Over some bicycles? What's with you two? It's complicated. He's a kid. Yeah, but we all have to grow up sometime. Now would be nice. Bud! Bud! Stop it! Bud! Bud, stop it! Aah! Let's go! Hey! Follow me! This way! Let's go! Whoa. Hey, guys. Come on! Cover him! Nice shot. Thanks. Hey, come on. What the hell? A Puffy video. Of course. Yo, we got company. Trevor, you loaded? Full up. All right, stay here with Nina, okay? We'll be back. Wait, please don't shoot! Don't shoot! The fuck are you doing here? I-- I was trying to get away. Those things were after me. I found this compound. I just came here for shelter. So you took off to save your own ass? No. And destroy some kind of evidence, huh? Says something about Project Wildfire. Your name's on every one of them. What is Project Wildfire? I don't know how my name-- Listen to me! My mom's dead. My hometown's turned into a fucking slaughterhouse. You either tell me what you know, or so help me, I will shoot you dead right here. Look, if you'll just give me a second to explain-- Don't lie to her. If you'll let me finish-- Go ahead. There were a few select scientists studying certain biochemical agents. Including you? Were you studying them or creating them? Look, I was in Washington to give a report. I couldn't reach anyone here. Then I heard about the quarantine. Look, we don't know our research has anything to do with this outbreak. Yes, we do. Ahem. The virus-- It was three days ago. ...has mutated, and somehow we have all become infected or eaten, and I'm the last. I think I've killed them all: Tom, Grace, and everyone. I, uh... have sealed myself inside this bunker. I've destroyed the samples and archived my notes. And I don 't know why the infection is moving so slowly, but I can feel it. I can feel the malevolence. I'll die here like the pharaohs with my legacy, a beautiful weapon... beautiful weapon. What was this virus supposed to do? It was designed to paralyze enemy troops by shutting down their neural system for six to seven hours. We didn't think it would mutate. Come on, this would have allowed us to capture people without killing them. It was intended to save lives. Yeah, hell of a job, Doc. He got out. Yeah, the door was open when Nina and I got here. Why aren't we all sick? Some people have a natural immunity to specific viruses. Lucky us. But from what l understand, once bitten, there's no protection. Whatever, man. Where's the back door? There isn't one. Oh, shit. Stay here. You back? I'm not going to die down here, but you, you knew about this. No, I didn't know. I swear. Nina, Nina, no. He's not worth it. He's smarter than the others. Don't believe this shit. I'm not going back into that airshaft. Raah! Shut up, bitch. Hey, did you guys get him? He's in the ventilation system. Yeah, I got his little girlfriend, though. That's Dr. Engel. He was the best man on the team. If they do retain something of what they were, we are so screwed. We have to find a way out. That's the only way out. That's why we chose this place. Man, I thought scientists were supposed to be smart. Here, follow me. Dumb asshole. This place is a Nike site, right? Yeah. Well, they weren't making sneakers up in here. Nike sites were built during the Cold War to house missiles. What? What, you were smoking weed during history class? Anyways, there were missiles, and there had to be missile silos. We find one of those, and we'll have our escape route. Hey, what happened to Fuck-Face? Oh, Jesus. We have to find that silo. It's going to take forever to search all these hallways. We've got to split up. We meet back here in five minutes. Why do white people always want to split up? I'm not doing it. He's right. Whatever. It's y'all's funeral. Who is going with who? Trevor, you're gonna go with me. No. Trevor and l stick together. We'll be okay. All right. Five minutes. Not a second longer. Be careful. You look hot. Shut the fuck up. Lucky somebody paid attention during history class. Yeah, you're not as dumb as you look. Oh, yeah? Well, you're not as annoying as you look. Just in case. Go! Sarah, run! Are you all right? Yeah. Salazar? Great. Holy shit. What? It's missile propulsion tanks. Are you sure? Yeah. We can rig these like giant flamethrowers, get all those things in one place, and just blast the shit out of them. All right.
