In a few months, president Obama will push legislation to legalize the nation's 12 million illegal immigrants. ...I feel bad when the bus is leaving-- And I know that he's there. Illegal immigration... America's 21st century dilemma. It's estimated that more than a million illegal immigrants enter the U.S. every year. They face countless dangers. Some succumb to dehydration and exposure. Some fall victim to human traffickers and warring drug cartels. And others... Simply disappear. Why do they risk their lives? Because the American dream's still so powerful. Hey, Spielberg. We get it. Come on, man. Got a headache. Dude, dude, guys, check out the bullet holes in that sign. I feel like a bear took a shit in my head. Hey, Brad, can you pull over, brother? Brad. Brad. Brad, pull... Brad. Brad. Brad. Hey, we do need to shoot some b-roll on that. Pull the shit over, Bradley. Thank you. No, no, no, no. We're already late. How do you be late? We're in Mexico. Jim. What? I'm sor--, I had a big night last night, O.K.? I slept in. Because...

What are you drinking there? Electrolytes, bro. You look like shit. Mmm. I love being around creative people like you guys; You're so, like, in the moment. So... Brad. Where are you from again? Uh, well, I was actually born in Dallas. And, and, and how long did you live in London? I was in London for about a year. A whole year? Travis, don't you... Have anything to do? Keep yourself busy? No, this is all I got to do right now, actually. It works out nice. Babe, babe, I can handle myself, all right? Yeah, west Texas boys could be quite rambunctious. How do you say "suck my cock" in an English accent? Suck on my cock. Suck on my cock. Suck, suck on my cock. Suck on my cock. Cock, cock, cock... Suck on my cock. I'm the queen of england. I suck cock... With Brad. You know what's really funny? She actually hates London. Didn't you say that? You, you hated...? No, I just hated London with you. Ooh... get a little e.C.U. On that one. Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker. No comment. What's your response to the allegations you ran a sweatshop of illegal immigrants? I run a family business. A family business. That's very noble of you, sir. Does a family business threaten and intimidate their employees? Does it deny their workers safety equipment? Does it fire them when they're injured on the job? Whoops. Get that camera out of my face! Mr. Whitaker, what about Miguel Gonzales, the man that you crippled? Was he family? Would you apologize to him? Car troubles? I have a Mexican friend, he can fix that. He's a citizen though, is that gonna be an issue? Did you get that? Tell me you got that. ...all right, let's get going. Got everything. O.K., I'll ping you. All right. That sound good? Sorry. Be safe. See you back in Austin, babe. Really? Uh-huh. Bye, babe. Hey, later Brad. Let's hang out. Yeah? No. Si. Guys, guys, this is my cousin Alberto. ...my friends... This guy is the director. Yo, man. Hi, Liz. Yeah, Liz. Will. No, no, no, no, no. No touch, no touch. No touch-ey. Whoa, whoa... So, how much is, uh, how much is this trip costing you? Much... eh... eh, si... Yes, yes. ...my daughter. Si. ...have a family. Gracias! Gracias! Here's, um... Here's one thousand dollars. Mmm. What? 2500 is the best he can do. No, you told me 200 each-- that's one thousand dollars, comprendo? Would you tell him that? Hey, hey, hey! Would you stop filming, please? I stopped. Thank you. Now it's a thousand dollars each. Fine, fine. 2500. - Bueno... bueno... - Bueno... What? He says we won't regret it. I already do. What? He says you're very beautiful. Right. Thank you. Como esta... Come on. You all set? Behind me, two dozen men, women and children have sacrificed everything for this moment. They're about to cross over 300 miles of treacherous terrain for Miles of treacherous terrain for the promise of a better life. We're gonna join them. How was that? Patronizing. Come on. Jim! Let's go, man. What are you doing? O.K., coming! Sorry, bro. Had to take care of some business. You're trying to get some bud? What? I get nauseous on long car rides. When I found about out what happened to Miguel, I cried. ...probably for the first time since my daughter Claudia was born. Family is the most important thing to me, supporting them and when I found out, I had to do something. Boo! What are you doing? I'm doing an interview, silly. What are you doing? You can't do that. I'm doing an interview. I'm a blessed man. I'm a blessed man. I love you. I love you. I know. Gracias. Disneyland. Disneylandia! ...have a safe trip. Ciao, amiga, good-bye. Gracias. Shh. All right, all right, we're recording. Come on, let's go. Wait, wait, wait... Good, O.K. Um... I can't disclose our exact location, but, um, as you can see behind me, everyone is heading to the point of entry. The border fence is just past that hill over there. Uh... We're about to cross, illegally, into the United States. Got that shit? Good. Whoa, whoa, whoa, go, go! Watch the camera! Holy shit. Holy shit. It's dark in here, guys. We're gonna have to turn on the night vision. Night vision. Fuck me. Hey, dude, you O.K.? - Yeah. What is this place? - It's a drug tunnel. I don't know about this at all. You a little scared? No. A lot scared. You all right? Yeah. [Indistinct whispering What was that? I don't know-- go. Let's move. Don't worry. Fine, I'm fine. Not nervous. Not nervous. [Man speaking Spanish, Shh, shh. Shh... What is it? Shit, I can't tell. Wait-- no, no! Oh, my God! Davie, get, get back here. Get that fucking camera off me. Amen. Hey, t. I'm gonna make sure everyone's all right, O.K.? Hey. Hey, man, you O.K.? No. O. K. Fucking bullshit. Jesus. What the fuck did we get ourselves into? I know. Listen to me. In eight hours, we're gonna be... we're gonna be back, back in our apartment. All right? Take a shower. We'll have a beer. Oh, a shower, man. We'll smoke a fatty. All right? Relax. You're O.K. Listen, this was a mistake. I'm gonna call Brad, he's gonna come pick us up. No, no, no. Do not call Brad. I have to call him. Hey, what did we say? Are you kidding me? What? Are you kidding me? We're done. We're done. We did not sign up for this. I know, this is a thousand times better. You think that was better? How was that better, Travis? Somebody died back there. That is not better. Put your phones-- Listen to me, O.K.? This trip, this whole thing was your idea, all right? We got shit here, we got shit we got shit here, we got shit no one has ever even seen before. That's true. Let's go finish. The worst is over. Let's just... let's just finish All right. We're falling apart. Is he O.K.? Are you O.K.? Yeah, I'm fine. You all right? Thirsty, you want some water? Yeah. Do you have any? I don't know what happened to mine. Don't worry about me, I'm fine. No-- do you have my water, actually? Hello? Hey, hey, yeah, it's me. We're in the U.S. You're not gonna believe what happened. No, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's O.K., yeah. Um, he's, he's all right, he's not bothering me. Fuck you, Brad. Yeah, that was him. That's fine. I can handle him, O.K.? Come on. Go on. I love you. O.K., bye. Are we rolling? Yeah. Follow the coyote when he's over there. Make sure you get the coyote when he's going up over there. There he goes, there he goes, there he goes. Shh. It's O.K. [Indistinct [Indistinct whispering We're now on American soil, where it looks like our midnight where it looks like our midnight ride has arrived. Everyone seems to be in good spirits. If you look around, the tension has died. There's a stillness to the night. Seems like it's gonna be a pretty tight fit. Shit, grab your shit. Grab your shit, come on, go, go, go. Are you getting this, filming? Wait-- no, no, no, my camera! Fuck! O. K., it's working. Selina, selina, come here. Wanna do shadow puppets? It looks like a mouse to me. That's a very good one. It's very cramped in here. We're about a hundred Miles away from the safe house. The air is tense. Let's go talk to some of our travelers. Como? Yes, officer? I'm gonna need you to step out of your vehicle. What did I do wrong, sir? Shh, shh, shh. Yeah? Can you hear me, it's an emergency. Hello? He-- damn it, nothing. Put the camera away. We've gotta put it away now. Put them away now. Do what I'm saying. Put 'em away, just do what I'm saying, put it down. All right. All right. Everybody should get your passports ready, I'll try... We're Americans! Please! Don't shoot!! Please. What is your full name? Travis Williams. Why am I blindfolded? Full name. Now. Elizabeth tonin. My name? Uh... It's James. Bowman. David Juan Luis Martin decario. All right, we'll do this the hard way. What are you doing here? I'm sound. Speak up. Sound. Sound guy. I'm a director. Director of what? I already told you, we were shooting a documentary. About what? Illegal immigration. Are you a U.S. citizen? Come on, man, you have my passport-- what is this? Look in my wallet please. Check-- give me my wallet. Look, there should be a wad of cash-- You want your wallet? There's your wallet. We're grad students. Making a thesis film. Nobody's gonna see it. That is peyote. It was in your backpack. No, uh, that's, that's not possible. Because... I don't even own a backpack... sorry. Ah! Ow! You feel that? ...listen to me very carefully. Whatever you think this is... it's far worse. What do I have to do? What, what do I have to do to get them out of this, tell me. Uh. Hold on, just gimme a second. My crew and I have been detained by a group... Of patriots. They promised, they said that they would let us go if we document their activities... And their philosophy. If, uh, if we spread word of their movement, so... Is that good, is that it or no? Is that O.K.? Over here. Come closer. Illegal immigration is a plague that threatens to overtake the United States of America. We are sick and tired of these vermin pouring in over our borders... Crawling up on our shores... Bleeding this country dry. We are slowly losing our country, but we are determined to take it back. Well, as you will see, we're not without mercy. All children are free to go. Psst, mira. No, no, no, no! No. No. No. No, mija. No, mija, no. Mama. Mama. Mama. Te quieres, tu mami... Children are smart. They'll find their way home. Dios mio. Let's show them what we're really about. Mi Nina, mi Nina. Listen up. I need one camera. Him, to film over there. Excuse me. Yeah, you put that on-- hey, not yet. Come back here. One camera. You, stay here with me. What the hell do you do? I'm a producer. You're a what? She holds the batteries. Listen up. I have only one rule with you. I talk, you film. If you interfere, if you say one single word without being spoken to, you're not gonna like what's gonna happen. Is that clear? Is that clear? Good. Let's roll. You there, not too close. That's enough. This charming fellow forces women to cross our border as drug mules. They have to swallow condoms filled with cocaine. It's about the only time you ever hear of Mexicans using condoms. If they refuse, a family member gets shot. He said "fuck your mother." He said "fuck my mother"? Youmother. I got this. Open up, come here, open up. Open up! Open up! Open up! Take it! Take it all! 90% of drugs in America come from vermin like this. You know what you're doing to my country? [Translates The harm that you are causing? The people that you're hurting? The families that you're tearing apart? Enough, enough of this, enough! Aw, shit. What? The condom broke. Fuck. Hey, hey. Hey. What the fuck. What is this place? Oh. Come on. You too. That's my camera. That's a security camera now-- don't touch it. Now try and get some sleep. You've got a long day tomorrow. Jesus Christ. They're gonna knock our fucking teeth out. No, they're not, o. K.? We're gonna stick together. Oh, stick together? Stick together and do what? What was that? I'm gonna get us out of here. I'm gonna get us the fuck out of here. What was that? Oh God. - I'm getting us out of here. - Fuck this. Put the camera on. Now! I'm turning it on! Turn it on! It's on, it's on! It's on? Yes, it's on. Rise and shine, everyone. Z wants to see you.

Hey, sweetheart, it's impolite to stare. You have maids? Well, they came to this country to work, and by God, I'm not gonna stop 'em. Please. Please. Eat. Where is he taking her? Hey, come back, come back. This young gentleman had a question. Get this on film. I want to know where you're taking her. She's sick. I'm taking her to the infirmary. You don't have a doctor here. Of course we do. We're not savages. Grab that. What the hell are you doing? I'm giving it to her. Pick it up. We have people for that. You heard me. You pick that up, you motherfucker-- hey! Rosa, give that back. What do you want Throw it out! Throw it out. That's her job. Don't ever do that again. I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot. So, let's start over. Get to know each other. Jim. I'm hungry. Marta is a fantastic cook. What about you? Are you on a diet? Here. I don't want it. Come on. You have to eat. It's protein. It's good for you. Chew, chew, chew, chew. That's how we do it. This, I can show you, this is El toro's room. Up here. Giving a tour. Giving a tour! He's got all kinds of, like, computers and, and stuff in there. Let's see. These gates right here, they're meant for, originally for cattle. But they work real good on the Mexicans. And it just keeps them right in line. And then if you look down, there's, we painted this orange line here because some of them... Some of them aren't, aren't real smart. So you paint the line and then they just follow right along. And it's like, it makes it really, really easy. Just on this side, that's where the artist's room is. He's got all kinds of stuff in there. And my room is just on the other side. And then a whole, this is all, this is like right in the middle of everything. And that's the, um, the infirmary is over here. Where's that pregnant girl that you guys were supposed to bring here? Um... And then just supplies. We keep supplies right here. Oh, and then, um, here's the food. We just mix it in. One of my jobs. Oh, here. She's, she's one of my favorites. Her, her name's espa-something, but I, I just call her Maria. And, I like to, I like to spoil her real good. Because she's my favorite. Why is she your favorite? Oh. She's real smart, real smart. I'll show you this. Apple slice. Maria had a little... Lamb? See? Here, this is the women's room. We keep all the women just over here. Everybody say hi. They're real shy. They're real, lot of them are real shy. Hi. Hi. Must be, must be that time of the month. Hey, hey! Hey! You need to stay over here with everybody else. He's just filming. Travis! Oh God, Alberto. Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. 'Cause, listen. You gotta stay back, 'cause, listen. 'Cause they will bite you. 'Cause, listen. 'Cause they will bite you. 'Cause they will bite you. They will bite you and you'll be sorry. No, shh. Shut the fuck up! Shut up! I'm not a Mexican like you. I'm a God damn American citizen. Get his wife. You and your wife have been granted a rare opportunity to gain entry into the united states of America. This is the official citizenship test. Take it away, Remy. O. K., I'ma give you the rules now. O. K., we're gonna ask you some questions. And for every one that you get right, we're gonna undo one of her wrists, so we're making it real easy on you. Question one. How many representatives are there in congress? How many representatives are there in congress? Oh yeah, no, it's not a English question, it's a math question. You know math? 435, you're wrong. O.K., question two. Who wrote the star-spangled banner? Huh? Que? Now that is very close. Francis Scott key. It's not que, it's key! Francis Scott key. Stop, stop it! Please! Please stop. When I applied for my citizenship, I had to take this test. And I was proud. I studied very hard. But you're defending a man who entered a country he doesn't even respect! He doesn't understand what you're saying. When it comes to fucking food stamps, these people understand English perfectly well! O.K., question three. How many stripes are there in the U.S. flag? Hey, hey, hey! Cheating. No cheating. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Twelve? No, no, thirteen. Thirteen. Thirteen. Thirteen! Ah! Thirteen, thirteen. Correct. Thirteen! Undo! Undo her wrist. Good job.

Now, the answer is Patrick Henry... hmm. Put him on the rack and bring in another wetback. Wait, wait. No, no, stop, stop. We need him. We need another cameraman. Davie can't do this shit by himself. Well, she seems to be handling herself perfectly well. She's a producer. She doesn't know shit. She's never held a camera in her entire life, please. Alberto told me on the truck he knows how to use a camera. We need him. You're not gonna get an illegal immigrant when there are Americans who can do the job. You have marta. - Hey, hey, hey.- O.K. Let's continue filming. Get him off the chair, get her out of here. Bien. Bien. They're leaving. I couldn't see how many, I don't know, three or four. But they got in their truck and they're leaving. Are you sure? No, I mean I'm not "sure sure", but yeah, there's a truck leaving. Yeah, it's gone. What are you doing? Liz? What? What are you doing? Trying to get out. Liz. Liz. Don't break, don't break. It's unbreakable. We tried that last night. Does anybody have a screwdriver or something? To try and get What the fuck? Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Let me see, let me see. What are you doing? What are you doing? Hold on, hold on. You're smarter than this, listen to me. I'm not listening to you, I listened to you... shh, shh! ...anymore with you! I'm not gonna calm down! Maria is dead. - And William is dead! - Hey, hey. - I am not gonna be the next one! - Sorry. Hey, hey. Sorry. You all right? Why do you think they left that door unlocked? We are fucking mice. It doesn't matter, man, listen, the door's open, they're gone. We've gotta take a shot. Sorry, listen. I just need you to think about this, O.K.? There's a right way, there's a wrong way. We use precision. We have some strategy, we have our tapes, we have our points of entry, exit. We're not just gonna go blindly into the dark. Wait a minute. Jesus. He's right. O.K., we think about it for a second, O.K.? Listen to me. We can help them. We can. Please. We can't stay here. O.K. O.K., good. All right. Give me a flashlight. No, no, no flashlight. O.K., be quiet. O.K. Why are you bringing the tapes? It's for the police. Someone's gotta shut these fuckers down. Alberto. O.K. Here, here-- take, take this. What if they see the lights? They can't, it's night vision. Travis, I can't see. Just follow us. We got night vision. Wait, wait, wait, wait. They make them sleep like this. Hey. Shh! Wait, wait, wait. Wait, where is it? Oh, oh shit. What is it? Hold the fence. Travis, what the fuck are you doing? Get down! Travis, what are you doing? All right, this is taking too long, we gotta go. Take this. O.K., O.K. Easy, easy. Oh shit. Fuck, fuck. Can't see shit. - Fuck, where's Alberto? We gotta go! - Hey! Shh. Alberto. Come on, Alberto, back up. What's going on? We gotta go, now. O.K. Which way? - Which way? I still can't see, I can't see. It's all barbed wire. - What is that? - Oh God. Shh. Oh shit, run, run! Help me! Help me! Ahh! I'm coming back. I'm coming back. Liz! [Shouts in pain, Ah, get him off! Get him off! Help! Pancakes. Thank you, marta. Good bacon. No, not him. He's not eating. I'm not hungry. I must say. I'm a little bit disappointed in you. You said you'd let the kids go. And we did. No, you didn't. Because we saw his daughter there and there were dogs and razor wire and-- they were given clear instructions, but his daughter didn't listen. She took off in another direction. But there's a lesson to be learned here. Don't fuck with me. The only way you're going home is to do exactly what I tell you. There's a few more things I'd like to get on camera. And if you challenge me again, I'm gonna fucking kill you. Could you please pass me the syrup? Thank you, Travis. You'll have to excuse the mess. Marta and the maids aren't allowed in here, and... I don't get too many visitors. Sorry about that. I've been wondering something. When you came in through the drug tunnel, what did you think of my work? I mean the, the, you know, the body in the tunnel. Did it frighten anyone away? Yeah. One, I think. One. That's, that's a problem. You see, I'm not here to build a better mousetrap. I'm here to build a better scarecrow. The hell does that mean? I'm glad you asked that. Think about that body you saw. All these videos that you're shooting right now, when we send them to the Mexican media, it'll put the stopper on. It'll say, "stay where the fuck you are." The right image can make all the difference in the world. I mean, that's why you're here. That's the point of this video. And to do that, the message needs to be stronger. Jesus! "Jesus." Oh, that's interesting. "Jesus." You know when the guy comes to school and he wants somebody from the audience, it's just like that. I just want you to come upstage. It's hard because she's lying flat and she's all stiff. I, I need somebody upright. Well, you're a botticelli now. But if I let you rot in the sun a few days, you'll be rubenesque. I'm gonna take a bone saw to her skull, right below the hairline. Right here. Skull cap comes off. Remove her brain, her eyes, all the soft tissues. Then, I'm gonna run electrical wiring through her sinus cavities to a hundred-watt bulb at the back of her brain pan. It'll look like a glowing, white halo. Like an angel. Imagine. Our sweet, innocent girl here, naked at the end of a tunnel. Cradling her baby like the Paints quite a picture, doesn't he? What's the surprise? Gonna lecture again while you kill someone? On the contrary. El toro screens the blood of everyone who comes here. And if they're clean, we'll make a donation on their behalf. And this man has been matched... For a kidney. The equation is very simple-- by saving an American life, we will spare his. Hey. We're not doing it for the money. We're doing it for our country. Hey, Remy, want to play spic-tac-toe? - Can I go first? - You can be "x" s. Help me or get out. Is he really a surgeon? 'Course he's a surgeon. Ugh. Gallo, you're a bleeder. You know, he's the first one to graduate from high school in his family. And then he just kept going right through med school. And then in his third year of residency, on his way back from the hospital, a gang of illegal immigrants approached him. All right, let's clamp off the blood vessels. O.K., get the cooler, let's go. He gave them everything he had in his pockets. No, no, that wasn't enough. Shh, he's a real good doctor. Know what they did? They fucking cut his throat. Gotta sew him up. Doesn't make it right. What was that? It doesn't make it right. Would you say the same thing? Hey! Shut the fuck up. Fuck you. Just film this. If someone came up to you with a fucking box cutter and just did this to you. Hey, z. I'd like to remove his corneas. What do you think? As long as he lives! Take whatever fits in the cooler. Jim-- shit! Jim, Jim. Hey, come back! - It's all right... - I got her. You O.K.? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, no, don't worry about it. Worry about Jim. Worry about Jim. Worry about Jim. Fuck, I don't know. I don't know where he is. I don't know. They're playing with us. They're never gonna let us go. Hey, don't. They have no reason to. We just need to find some leverage. Somehow we just, we gotta find something, there's gotta be... All right, get up, come on. Bring the cameras, let's go. Not until we see Jim. I want you to record that we're taking really good care of him. Continue filming. Hey. Hey. How you feeling? Feel really good. Yeah? Good. I want you to hang in there, O.K., because we're gonna get you home really soon. Feel good. Good, good. Listen, man. About last night, that was just, I didn't, I was... Don't worry about it, t. All right. Visitation's over! Wait a minute. Can we have five more minutes? No. Got a documentary to shoot. Come on. You know what? All right, you want a documentary? We'll have a documentary. Over here. Why are you doing this? Why am I doing this? Isn't that obvious by now? Oh no I, I, I completely get it. Illegal aliens cause crime. They carry diseases. So does everyone else. This is all just racism posing as patriotism. I bet you rehearsed that all morning. You want to know what I think? I'm thinking you're targeting Oh, she can think now! People like him and the people I'm thinking you're targeting people like him and the people outside because they're undocumented, and you get to do your sick things on them and think you can get away with it. Your propaganda, your patriotic front is bullshit. You're not a patriot. You're fucking insane. Don't take it! No, no. You feel that? Now that's what the brain of an idiot feels like. You want to be an idiot? Leave her the fuck alone! This is how it ends. Continue filming. It's not coming off. Yeah, don't worry, it'll come off. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, what's that? Shh, shh, shh. Shit, is that a truck? Oh, shit. Where is it? Hold it, hold it. There it is. There it is. Oh, God, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on-- fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Shit. Oh, oh, God, fuck. Lizzie. Lizzie, Liz, get up. See? I told you, a truck. Oh, my God. Hey! A truck, come on. Liz, Liz, a truck. Just please help us! Please, call, call the police. We've been kidnapped. They're trying to kill us. Be quiet, keep quiet. Oh, shit, he's right behind you-- run! Where the fuck have you been, man? Had to change a tire. Fuck. Jesus. Fuck. I thought I made myself perfectly clear, huh? No, no. You chose not to listen. Me and my men have shown you a lot of hospitality. And a lot of respect. What do we get in return? We're sorry. Yes-- no! It was, it wasn't like that. We're sorry. Huh? Fucking respect. Bring 'em in. I have to say, your tapes were very informative. Tia! Oh, fuck, please, man.
