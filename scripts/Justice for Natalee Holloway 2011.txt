Her story became every parent's worst nightmare. Natalee's mother, Beth, is with us for an exclusive interview... ...on this somber anniversary. - Good morning. Good to have you. - Good morning. Beth, talk about the fine line between hope... ...and acceptance of reality. Well, when this happened to Natalee, my life was defined. Defined with two children, my marriage and a job. Joran took my daughter's life and mine. He's still out there living his. What can I say? Ladies, they love me. Kiss me. After Natalee's disappearance, I lost everything. I lost that life. This is my life now, trying to get out and talk... ...and educate parents and young people. No other mother should ever get the call I got five years ago today. - Thank you, Beth. - Thank you. Come on, Mom. Do you think they'll ever get Joran Van Der Sloot? I won't stop until we do. Tell housekeeping not to clean my room. - Sure, no problem. - My girl needs to sleep. How did you know Natalee was dead? - People go into comas. - Yeah, I was worried for that... ... but, you know, it really scared me to death. The girl's never gonna be found, though, I'll tell you that. Because she is in the sea? Yeah. Who helped you dump her? A friend. I'm not gonna say who or... It wasn't my father, just a friend. With a boat? Yeah. - Please, don't turn it off. - I've seen it, numerous times. Captain Fisher investigated. The story makes no sense. What are you talking about? It's a confession. He admits to dumping her in the ocean while she was alive. The man Joran claimed drove the boat wasn't in Aruba. He was in Holland. He's just covering for his father. Paulus is still pulling the strings right now. That's enough. This is insane. I have a confession. I brought you a tape. I've ordered the captain to close the case. - What? - This meeting is finished. Nobody has ever paid for the death of my daughter. Somebody has to pay for this crime. - There she is. Beth, Beth. - Beth? Ms. Holloway, please. How do you feel about the judge's decision? One question for you. Paulus, Paulus. Mr. Van Der Sloot, over here. How do feel about the judge's decision? You. You're responsible for this. Why won't you let the truth come out? This madness needs to stop. No body, no crime, Miss Holloway. Leave my son alone. I'm sorry for your loss. - What's next? - Excuse me. Think your son will ever be charged? What do think about...? Once again, Aruba has refused... ...to prosecute the psychopath who took my daughter from me. Joran Van Der Sloot is a vicious criminal. I have him on tape bragging about what he did... ...but Joran can say whatever he wants, confess again and again... ...and Aruba will never do a damn thing about it. One more question. Well, I'll be home tonight, Matt, okay? I love you, honey. Okay, bye. I cannot believe I am leaving here again without her. I just wanted a place to lay flowers. You're the lawyer, John, explain this to me. Look, maybe it's time to let go. Maybe it's time... To what? Time to stop? What would you do, John, if this was your child? When do you stop? She's my daughter. Don't ever tell me to let it go. - Joran. - Joran, can we ask a few questions? What do you have to say about Natalee's mother... ...calling you a psychopath yesterday? Are you enjoying this? Pack. What? Why? I will not have you bringing this. You want to call attention... ...do it somewhere else. - I have supper if anyone's hungry. You think I want those cameras in my face? Yes, I do. I needed to make money. That's the only reason I talked to Patrick. I gave you everything. - That's why... - Go to school... ...and you need to do it somewhere else. I'll tell them to leave. - Paul? - You're kicking me out of the house? I'm kicking you out of the whole country. Agent Delaney. Beth. Hey, I'll catch up with you. - Hi. - Hi. I just wanted to update you... ...and find out if you have anything new on Joran. If we receive new information on Natalee's disappearance, we'll call. You are still investigating it. If this had happened on American soil... ...it would be a different story. I just wanna find out what happened. You can understand that. Listen, if there was anything we could do, we would be doing it. I promise you. Beth, please, just go home... ...let us do our job. - But you're not doing your job. He's still out there. Give me one. I didn't know you could just... ...light up in class like that. - Can't. I'm special. My father's a dean. Oh, so why do you even go to class? Why not just have him fix your grades for you? Don't know. Should ask him. Where's a good place to party around here? My uncle on my mom's side owns this club. Full of local girls. Show them a dollar, they do anything. Forget the locals. I have a thing for blond American girls. - That's a joke. - You're all over the Internet. Everyone thinks you're a killer. You shouldn't believe everything on Internet. Trust me, dude, no American girl is going near you. Hey, it doesn't matter what I'm famous for. What matters is I'm famous. You have the softest skin. I am a junkie for your skin. I'm obsessed with everything about you. I love the way you talk. Saw a guy. Gotta go talk to him. You stay put. Don't flirt with the locals. Sammy, come on. Showtime. That is Martin. That is Wouter. I know these guys from Holland... ...so don't piss them off. Do you think about hanging out with a better class of people? Because of that crap in Aruba, these are my people. Let's make it work. Hey, Wouter, this is Sam. Sam gets the girls. His balls big enough for the job? Mine are big enough. That's all you need to worry about. - Know what we want? - You want Thai girls... ...to dance in the clubs in Holland. Yeah, something like that. It's easy money, man. You know the girls, I convince the girls to get on a plane. That's what I do. I convince girls to do stuff. - Hey. - Jug, I don't know what to do. Judge in Aruba dismissed the case. The FBI says they can't do anything. Joran is back in college, in Thailand, getting on with his life... ...acting as if nothing ever happened. Everybody is getting on with their lives and I'm back here and... Oh, company, I'm sorry. I... Oh, crap. - Oh, Jug, I'm sorry. - We've been divorced for two years. - It's all right to forget my birthday. - No, it's not. Come and have a glass of wine. You know most of the people here. What else? Tell me everything. You're teaching again? Great. How's Matt? How's college? Well, I'm not officially teaching yet... ...but I'm excited to get back to the kids. - Matt's good. - Beth, hey, when did you get here? You here to see the birthday boy? I don't think I've seen you in forever. Hey, give her a little breathing room, huh? There's leftover food in the kitchen. You know, you should try the chicken. You know what? I am... I'm sorry, I have to go. You just got here. No, I know. I'm sorry, I... - Are you okay? - I'm fine. I am. I just... I can't do this, okay? Okay. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - You like? - Yeah, me like. You girls have what we need. So this is how we do this. We give you 10,000 baht and a plane ticket. You go to Holland for one year. You dance five nights a week, you party. You have fun. Then you get 20,000... ...and you come home rich or you stay because you love it. - Oh, that's dance a lot. - Yeah. That's dance a lot, but not really. You take breaks, you talk with the guys... ...you flirt, you make tips. You'll make better tips there than you'll ever make here. Okay? Okay. They're gonna go for it. That's good, that's good, but we do have one problem. - No problem. Everything goes smooth. - Yeah, yeah, no more financing. You supply cash up front, the girls get on a plane, okay? Then you get your money back. I just come up with 20,000? You'll double your money in two days. But if that's too much for you and your boy... ...we find other guy. No, I get the money. - It's my job. - Good. Have money by next week or we find some other place. Where are you gonna get that kind of money? - I'll find a way. - That's a lot of blackjack, Joran. I'm not talking blackjack, bitch. I'm talking a sure thing. - Deb. - Maybe Tuesday or something. - Phone call. - Look, Alan, I'm on in five. Trust me, you're gonna wanna take this call. You guys wait a second. Debra Stanville. This is Joran Van Der Sloot. Remember me? - Hello? - I'm here. What can I do for you, Joran? You give me $50,000... ...I tell you what really happened to Natalee Holloway. Joran offered to sell you the truth about what he did? - For $50,000. - What'd you tell him? Network wouldn't authorize it. He's not known for telling the truth. So he said he would send me proof that his story is real. He sent this chip. Said it was from his cell phone. Conversations he recorded with his father. We've been trying to authenticate it. One expert says it's real. Another says that it's definitely faked. So you be the judge. Joran, are you hanging in there? - I can't stand this lying anymore. - You have no choice. - You have to think about us too. - I am. But if they find the girl... ...at least there's proof that I didn't hurt her. But what you've done is pretty bad. Human trafficking is a serious crime. He said that he met some guy in a casino... ...that talked about buying a blond. He would give Joran $ 10,000 if he would find him a blond. - He said he sold my daughter? - To the sex trade in Venezuela. Well, he's probably lying again. A year ago, he said he left her in the ocean. But the recording. I mean, what if this is the one time he's telling the truth? What if she is alive somewhere in Venezuela? I'm going to Thailand to interview Joran to get more information. I'm gonna go to Aruba to try and corroborate the story. I'm going with you. Aruba officials, FBI, they can say whatever they want. This is not over. If there's a chance that my daughter is still out there... ...I'm not gonna sit at home and wait. I'm going. Okay. Joran. Looking for me? Ready to talk? Please. Why tell the truth now? Because it weighs on me. And if Natalee's family knows the truth... ...then, you know, they... They've... They can find her. - And you want her to be found? - That's all I want. Yeah. I met the girl at the bar. Aruba! We went to the beach. Boat pulls up on the sand. Natalee gets into the boat. With a stranger and without a word of protest? She thought I was going with her. - But you weren't. - No. Joran, climb aboard. Joran? You sold another human being into slavery. Yeah, I know. It's sick. But it was a lot of money at the time. Well, how much is a lot? Ten thousand. When did you tell your father? Why does that matter? So I can corroborate it. No, you don't need to do that. You gave us a chip with his voice. Of course we're gonna ask him. - I've got a reporter down there. - But that's not our agreement. Our agreement was you'll tell the truth. You had no right to talk to my father. Hey, look. Everything I just told you was a lie. Really? And I faked the conversation on the chip. Well... Thank you... ...for the money. What could he be talking about? We're here to find out if Joran's telling the truth. I need to look Joran's father in the eye. - I'll know if he's telling the truth. - We should get out of here. Joran admitted faking the whole conversation. The story was a lie. I am not leaving without facing that man. It's okay. It's okay. Let her go. We came here for the truth and I am getting the truth. - We have a recording. - What do you want? Joran said you knew... ...he sold my daughter and now he says it's a lie. He lies when you tell him to. Tell him to do the right thing, to tell me where Natalee is. Leave my property or I'll call the police. You're a mother. What if this happened to your child? Please, you could talk to him. You could... Do you ever think about how much you hurt my son? Stop harassing my family. I heard about the kind of girl your daughter was. Maybe if she hadn't been drinking and flirting like a... Get out. You can't protect him. He did this! He did this to her! Well, Lester, Joran Van Der Sloot is an opportunist. Anything he can do and can get over on somebody... ... if he can make some money, have some fun, manipulate people... ... he enjoys doing that. He is a classic psychopath. Now, to a new confession in the disappearance... ... of Alabama teen, Natalee Holloway. She vanished during a class trip to Aruba back in 2005. Now, the primary suspect in the case is speaking in an interview last night. In the middle of our interview, Joran told me he made the story up. But as we've learned from him, no one knows... ... what is truth and what is fiction. Is he lying about lying? Hey, this is Jug. Leave a message, I'll call you back. I'm over it. Pay, each girl, 10,000. There's too much heat, Joran. - It's not going to happen. - Just once... Because you're on the television, man. It's too much. Deal is off. Now, take the girls to Holland or you give me back my money. Forget who you're talking to, Joran. - I never want to hear from you again. - Come on, Joran, let's go. Hey, Papa. No more, son. I thought getting you out of the country would help, but apparently not. I'm tired of watching you. - It's not my fault, eh? She lied to me. - I don't want to hear it anymore. Get a job, Joran. Because you won't get another penny from me. Get those files. Let me go through them one more time. Agent Delaney? - Excuse me. - What the hell? - We have a window. - What are you talking about? Paulus is dead. He was the one protecting Joran. He was the one telling him what to do. Now that he's gone, I think we can get to Joran. He's figured out that lying works for him. So, what, that's it? - You're done? - No, it's not a crime to lie to the media. He killed my daughter. The whole world knows it. The whole world is looking at you... ...wondering why this monster is getting away with murder. When do you start doing your jobs? If you let him walk away, it's like saying Natalee's life never mattered. Her life mattered, Agent Delaney. It mattered. If you won't get him, I will. Why don't you take your brother for a walk. - Go ahead. On the beach. - Yeah, let's go. This... ...is not my fault. - No. I did not ask for any of it. Joran, listen to me. He loved you. Everything he did, he did to help you. You are the man of the house now. Maybe it's time to start the next part of your life. You need help? Okay. You need glue? - Cheryl, can you help Tallea? - Yeah, sure. What is it? What's happened? I got an e-mail. - A few of them. - From? - Joran. - What? What...? What are you talking about? He e-mailed you? Well, what does he want? Well, he said he wants to do the right thing. He'll take you to Natalee. He's gonna want money. - How did you respond? - Told him I didn't trust him. That I'd have to talk to you. I think we should pay him. - What? - I am so sick of all of this. It is time to put up or shut up. Tell him I'll pay him to tell me where Natalee is. Are you seriously thinking of giving this guy money? Beth, that's a bad idea. - I told you I was gonna get him myself. - What if we recorded him? Get him on tape asking for money. Okay, Alabama is one of three states in the country... ...where wiretapping is legal and admissible. If you get him on tape asking for a specific dollar amount... ...and he actually takes the money... - That would be extortion. You could prosecute. Right here in Alabama. And we could put him away for a long, long time. Hello? Is this Natalee's mom? It's Joran. Hello, Joran. I hope you understand. You know, I want to do the right thing. You have no idea how much I want this monkey off of my back. It's very hard for me to live with this. How much do you want? Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I'll have to see if I can get that much. I can take you to Natalee... ... but nobody can know that this came from me. Otherwise... ...I lose the last group of people in my life... ...that are important. I'll have John e-mail you. Okay? Okay. Bye. Beth, we have to be smart. We asked for the FBI's help. They're giving it. We need to do it their way. Okay, he has a tendency to jump when he feels pressure. We don't want him blowing the whole thing. You set up the deal, we send John to Aruba with the money... ...and that boy will spend his adult life behind bars. - I don't trust the people in Aruba. - We're ready to go. Ready for this? - Hello. - I'll give you the money. Great. This situation, it hurts everybody. It's consumed five years of my life too. - How do I know you're not gonna lie? - I know it's tough to trust me... ... after what happened with the others... ...but I wouldn't lie to you. That would be beyond horrible. I'm ready for a new phase of my life... ...to try and better myself as a human being. I'll give you 25,000 up front. When we find Natalee, you'll get the rest. How do I know that you're not lying? I'll have my lawyer draw a contract that guarantees it. He'll bring it when he brings the money. You tell him what happened to my daughter, where I can find her... ...you'll get the rest. - I want it put... ...in the contract that you pay... ... a million-dollar penalty if anyone finds out... ... the information came from me. - Okay, that's fine. - Okay. It's not that I think I'd go to jail... ...in maybe a few years... ...but probably not. What happened is not... It's not as bad as you think. I'll have John e-mail you to set the time and place. Okay. Take care then. "Take care." Can you believe this kid? I don't know if I should believe him or not. Maybe Paulus was the one stopping him from telling the truth. Either way, it's a win, okay? If he tells the truth, you get Natalee home. And if he lies, we get him on extortion... ...we bring him to U.S. Soil to stand trial. Nothing is ever that simple with Joran. I'm sorry to bug you and all at school. I just really need to make sure you're okay with it. To make these extortion charges stick, I have to give him a chunk of money. Twenty-five thousand dollars. The only way to come up with that... ...is to use the savings. Matt, it will dip into your college fund. - Lf you don't wanna do this, I can... - No, you should. I'd give everything that I have to see that guy behind bars. With you a thousand percent. Wait, Jug. - Lf I could tell you, I would. - It's fine, I already know. Joran told another story and you've gotta run down and look into it. Or maybe he contacted a reporter and said he... - That's not what's going on. - You know, all this time... ...I feel guilty that I wasn't supportive enough for you. I'm just in your way, Beth. You're obsessed with him. He's obsessed with you too. You keep circling the world. Aruba, Holland, Thailand. This what you want? - Do you think this is what Natalee...? - I don't want any of this, Jug. I wanted to be going to Natalee's graduation... ...planning her wedding. I hate this. I do. I just... I need to know what happened to her. And then what, Beth? Then what happens? I mean, you've defined yourself by this tragedy. And there's no you left. Honey, I loved her too. But she's gone. When are you gonna live your life again? All right. You're hot. Go and slide that back. Tuck it in. Make sure he sits across from you. Ask him to count the money. If he moves, ask him to count again. - Right. - Here you go. This keychain has GPS in it, so we can track you. Van Der Sloot thinks you have $25,000 cash on you... ...so he could have a friend take you down, drag you out. You'll be fine. And if you feel things start to go south... ...you know the code word, it's "fire." Then you hit the deck. We take him out right where he stands. We've got agents all over this hotel, all right? No way he's getting the jump on us. John, thank you for doing this. Okay, Joran's in the lobby. - Come on, let's get you in there. - Okay. Be careful. He said they'd meet us down there. He's walking in. Okay, now. Okay, now. Guys, guys. Joran. We finally meet. Yeah. He's in. You are Beth Holloway's lawyer? John Kelly. Please, come in. - You wanna have a seat? - No. You have the cash? Yeah, of course. We found out right before we left... ...that Customs would only allow us to bring in $ 10,000 cash. We're gonna have to wire you the rest. You just brought 10,000? Yeah, Natalee's mother is waiting... ... to wire the rest into whatever account you want. It's not our agreement. I did not say that was okay. All right, I understand, but still, you get the money. I should never have trusted you, l... - No deal. - What do you mean, no deal? - You screwed it up. - No, no, no, Joran. - We can't let him go. - Sit tight. We'll figure this out. Don't let him out of your sight. What do we do? - John. - Yeah? - Go after him. - Right. We've gotta talk him back into that room. Block it. Block it. He's moving to the elevator. Joran. Joran, wait, wait. Joran. Joran. Please, please, look. I'm sorry. I should've let you know when I knew about the Customs rule. I thought you'd be fine with the rest wired. - I'm not fine with it. - Let him try to talk him back in. Beth. John stopped him. What could I do to make you feel better about this? You don't get it. I'm trying to help you help Natalee's mom. Then help us. Please. Let's go back to the room. - I'm taking a big risk here. - So are we. So why don't we try trusting each other. Maybe we can both get what we want. Here. Just relax, okay? All right. So... Here we have... ...the contract... ...signed by Beth. - Ten thousand dollars. - Come on, kid, take the money. - Go ahead. - Take it, you son of a bitch. He's counting it. Yeah, we're gonna send that creep away for a long time. It's all here. Of course it is. Now, all we need is an account number. We'll give it to Beth and she wires you the rest of the money. - Perfect. - Here we go. - I'll e-mail it to her. - Wire the money. It shouldn't take long. I've got nowhere to be. You know, l... Actually, I have a candy bar in here somewhere. Want half? Yeah... Oh, sure. Okay. I'm gonna turn myself in... ...after I tell you about Natalee. Really? I know you don't believe me... ...but it weighs on me and that's... It's hard. Go ahead, you're good. - Hello. - I sent the confirmation to your phone. Great. I'll forward it to Joran's phone. - I wanna talk to him. - No. Beth... ...I don't think that's a good idea. Please hand Joran the phone. Okay. It's Beth. She wants to talk to you. What do you want? I wanna know what you did to her. Okay. You get what's, you know, you pay for. We were on the beach. We were having a good time. We were playing, you know. I don't wanna go home tomorrow. And she asked me to put her down... ...because I was carrying her. Please, Joran, put me down. Put me down. But she fell. She hit her head on a rock. That's when she started bleeding... ...and she started shaking... ...and she... You know, she stopped breathing. It was... You know, it was an accident. And I felt horrible. I called my father. So he came. He saw her and he said, "No, this is... Joran, there's no way people are going to think this is an accident. " So he... Yeah. He told me to go home. It was his idea to bury her... ...in the gravel of a foundation. Because they were pouring concrete the next day. And I asked him... ...where he was taking her. But he just told me he would... He'd take care of it. And finally... ...he told me. So, what you're saying is that she's buried under... ...something, some kind of house or something? Northeast corner. And you didn't see her buried? Natalee was just... She... She was such a pretty girl and so sweet... ...and now she's like a ghost. And it just haunts me wherever I go. You tell... You tell her mother how... That I'm sorry for what happened to her. Where's the house? Where is the house? Beth. Beth. Listen to me. We really shouldn't be doing this. Delaney told us to sit tight. I have been sitting tight for the last four days. - I thought he was gonna be arrested. - We should be doing this their way. Hello? Oh, hi. - Can I help you? - We were just admiring your house. - You've done a nice job. - Thank you. - It looks almost new. - We built it two years ago. Two years? Yes. The land was all swampland and we had it fit, but... I thought these houses were all built five years ago. No, no, nothing was here five years ago. - Nothing? - No. - Well, thank you. - Okay. Thanks. You shouldn't have lied to me. How did you get this phone number? Was it for the money? Was it for fun? I wish that I could tell you the truth. I do and someday I will. But right now, I just... I get in trouble with some very bad people. I want you to hear me, Joran. I'm gonna get you. Hey, hey, hey. You're the one who came knocking on my door with this, remember? You know me. You know I'm not a man of my word. And you never should have been so stupid. I was never... ...what you wanted me to be. What are you talking about, Joran? Good night, Mama. Hey, you two stay here, all right? We'll bring him out in a minute. Keep an eye on them. Two guys that way. And give me one around here. Let's go. Federal Bureau of Investigation. - We're here to talk to your son. - What...? - What did he do? - Which one is his room? Well, it's one on the right, but... Please. - Head down there. - Got it. Check the other side. - Got him? - He's not here. - No sign of him. - Okay, he's not in here. Sorry for your trouble, ma'am. What happened? Where is he? I'm sorry, Beth, he's gone. I told you. I told you. You never took me seriously. I knew he would find a way out. You have no idea who you were dealing with. They were supposed to have eyes on him. I got promises from Aruban officials. Then they let him get on a plane to Colombia? Probably gave him a ride to the airport. Anything to avoid another media storm on the island. Listen, you get in touch with Interpol or whoever, right? There's no place on this green earth that that smug son of a bitch can hide. That sign out front said you speak English. It's hotel policy. We hold your passport until you pay your final bill. You do a lot of traveling. Yeah, I am hooked on it. Just came in from Colombia. Then welcome to Peru. Sure you still wanna go to New York? We can cancel the flight, tell all the shows that you're sick. The five-year anniversary, it's good for the foundation. - What's good for you? - It's good for me too. Besides, I'm gonna have you there with me. You're a good mom. - I'll tell the cab we'll be out. - Okay. He said they would give me $ 10,000 for one girl. We were on the beach. I picked her up, she fell, hit her head. We were at a party. We were having fun. She was pretty wasted, I think. I didn't even see her fall. So... ...whose money am I taking? Mom, hurry up or we're gonna be late. Impressive haul. They are coming home with me. Let's get a cab. No, no, no, my car's over here. - Let's go. - Nice parking spot. Five years ago today, Alabama teenager, Natalee Holloway... ...went to Aruba on a school trip with some friends and never returned. Her story became every parent's worst nightmare. Natalee's mother, Beth, is with us for an exclusive interview... ...on this somber anniversary. In creating this organization, we hope to prevent... ...as many missing person cases as possible. So are you really not going to tell me your name? I am going to pee. Van Der Sloot would be arrested, released, arrested again... ... and finally, the case against him dropped. Hey, put us in another poker tournament. Okay. - Five and 10. - All right. I have to go. Why? Where are you going? What are you doing looking at my stuff? - Please get out of my way. - What, you're gonna believe that? They don't know what they're talking about. Let me out of here. That's why I stay out there, talking. It's too late for Natalee and me... ...but it's not too late for others. Hi. Can I have two coffees... ...and two of those pastries? My girlfriend, she can't live without her coffee. Excuse me, sir. Is that your black Jeep outside? Yeah, my girlfriend's. You have to move it. Okay. Let me grab the keys. Those two. Would you ask housekeeping not to clean my room today? My girl needs to sleep. No problem. It is forever since we have had a real pastalmovie night. I know. It'll be fun. - You got it? - Yup. Hey, Matt. It seems like I'm always doing something for someone else. You're the most important person in the world to me. You know that. I love you, sweetie. I love you too, Mom. This movie better not be a chick flick, okay? I need to get out of Peru. I committed a murder. I need to get out of here. Just kidding. Can't find my ID. - You got money? - Yeah. Toothpaste. It's not going to be easy to get you across, you know. El otro watch. This watch worth... ...seven thousand dollars. Seven thousand dollars? That's okay. Stephany. Stephany? Marielena? Where's Stephany? I know she's a young woman and sometimes she'll stay out late... ...but two nights, it's not like her. We've called her friends, everyone we can think of. We know she came for a poker tournament. Seor Flores, it is an honor to have you here in our casino. I voted for you when you ran for president. I've been looking at security footage since Captain Martinez called. And I think I have located your daughter on the tape. Come. That's her. That's Stephany. Who is the boy? We're checking if anyone knows. We have footage of them leaving together around 4:30 in the morning. Lavilla said that Stephany and the boy, they only speak in English... ...or he thinks that the boy is Dutch. I know who the boy is. It's Joran Van Der Sloot. - Come on. - How far do we have to go? Don't worry. - Can we find out where he's staying? - Sure. He's a murderer? - Hi. - Hey. I was just nowhere near your house. Do you wanna get a cup of coffee or a meal or something? - Really? - Yeah. Come on in. I'll make some coffee. You have a cappuccino maker? I'm trying new stuff. So Matt went back to college. Yeah. He called to say goodbye. I'm glad you came by. I miss you, Jug. I miss you too. He asked not to clean his room. He said his girlfriend was resting. It's been two days now. No. He doesn't look like he's from around here. Told you, man. - Who is it? - Detective Martinez. - Did you go to the hotel? - Yes. - Did you find him? - No, he's gone. The maid saw him leave already. - We have to find him. - What? - The boy's gone. - Well, do you know where he went? We sent his photo to all the bus stations, the airport, the post office. What are you not telling us? We found Stephany's body in his hotel room. - No. - I'm so sorry. - No. - I am so sorry. No. No. We've got breaking news. The prime suspect in the Natalee Holloway disappearance... ... now wanted for murder, the murder of a woman in Peru. Joran Van Der Sloot, on the run in South America right now. The 21-year-old victim... ... was last seen with Van Der Sloot on Friday. Joining us, NBC's Michelle Kosinski. Michelle has been covering the case... Van Der Sloot was driven across the border into Chile yesterday afternoon. I'll give a reward to any who catch him. He may have gotten a bit out of our reach. I have friends at Interpol. This boy will not get away with murder again. Not here, not in Peru, not with my daughter. He'll get away with murder again. He used my money and killed an innocent girl. - This is not your fault, Beth. - I should've done more. If I had done my job, this poor girl would still be alive. Mama... ... it's me. Joran? Mama, I want to come home... ...so could you send me money for a plane ticket? I'm not sending you money. Not anymore. It's all over the news... ...what you did to that girl in Peru. I did not do anything to her. Stop lying. They found her dead in your room. What? No, that can't be right. When... She was asleep when I left her. What happened to you, Joran? What did I do wrong? I gave you everything you ever wanted. I take care of you. I do the same for you as I do for your brothers. How could I have raised such a boy? I didn't do anything to Stephany. You have to believe me. Tell the truth, Joran. Mama. Mama, I'm telling the... Mama, I'm telling the truth, okay? So... You need to turn yourself in. I... I want to come home. You know, so, please. I can't help you anymore, Joran. Hey, taxi. Hey. Joran? Joran? I'm coming. What is it? Got a call from Interpol. They got him. Good evening, and welcome to Dateline. I'm Chris Hansen in Lima, Peru. The Natalee Holloway story has taken some strange turns over the years. But none more bizarre than the twists we've seen in the last several days. Joran Van Der Sloot, prime suspect in her disappearance... ... once again the focus of international headlines... ... accused of another shocking crime. Could it be the beginning of the end of the Natalee Holloway mystery? Joran Van Der Sloot, the 22-year-old playboy... ... twice arrested in the disappearance... ...of teenager Natalee Holloway, has been named the prime suspect... ... in the death of a Peruvian woman... ... found murdered in a Lima hotel. Put that on. - I think I can handle them. - I don't care what you think. The people out there, they want you dead. Put the vest on. Stephany Flores was killed five years after... ...the May 30th, 2005 disappearance of Holloway... ... during a school trip. With Van Der Sloot's arrest... ... we will finally know what happened in Aruba. Go. Go. Why did you go into hiding? - Spend the rest of your life behind bars? When will I be extradited... ...back to Aruba or Holland? There's not gonna be no extradition. I should have a lawyer. - Stand there. - Stand right there. Don't move. I knew her, yeah. I don't know. We met... ...a few days ago. She was nice. She was like my friend. Here. Can I get some water, please? I didn't kill her. You know, I heard from my mother that she was dead... ...and that you were looking for me. So I was going to come back here... ... and turn myself in. I should tell you... ...what happened to Natalee. What? Tell you where Natalee Holloway's body is... ...and everything... ...that happened if... If you want. We should make a deal, you think? Maybe we can take a break. I could use some fresh air or just stretch a little. And some food. We have the security tape. We see you walking into your room with Stephany. We see you walking out of that room alone. And on the same tape... ...we don't see anybody else going into that room... ... before we found her body. Her bloody, beaten, strangled body. What do you have to say? L... I killed her. Yeah, the girl was all up in my business... ...and so I asked her to stop. She punched me. - This "business," what does that mean? - She was reading my laptop... ...about me... ...about the Natalee Holloway thing. That's it. Look this over. Sign right here. This is not a day to celebrate a monster. We are here to recognize... ... the life of a beautiful girl. I got a message for you from Seor Flores. Hating this man, it does nothing for my family or for me as a person. Stephany is in a higher place... ...but she will always be here in our hearts. Do you think Joran's arrest will help solve the Natalee Holloway case? I hope. Perhaps his arrest will give peace to her family. God has chosen my daughter as an instrument... ... for this man to pay for his crimes. He is using her so that no other parents... ...will ever suffer what we have suffered. The badges need to be visible. - Is this your whole crew? - Yes. Okay, let's go. We'll get you through security. We'll get you wired for the interview. If the prison knew we were doing this, they would be very unhappy. And they denied Joran's motion to void his confession. They say it was all by the book. No coercion. And the evidence is overwhelming. He's going to be convicted. He has no reason to lie anymore. Are you going to be all right? I have hated him for five years. I have wanted to peel the skin off of his face. There's four hidden cameras in the room. This is your mike. You just ask him whatever you want. This has to be it, you know? Enough is enough. Okay? Enough is enough. All right. Okay. Okay. Thank you. I didn't know it would be you. - I should go. - Will you sit down with me, Joran? Just give me a couple of minutes. I just wanna get face-to-face. Yeah, okay. Okay. You're looking at spending the rest of your life in this prison. And I know you wanna make a plea deal in Peru... ...and Aruba, and in the U.S. I just need to know what you did to my daughter. I wanna know what happened. I wanna move on, okay? I just wanna move on. If it was an accident, just tell me. Okay? I don't know, I don't know. L... It's too late for Natalee. It's too late for Stephany. It's too late for me. But it's not too late for you, Joran. You have your own life ahead. You can sit in this prison acting like you don't have the answers. You can sit in this prison till you're 60 years of age, denying. But you can make some choices here. You can make the right decision. Yeah, you know, it's just... It's very tough for me to talk to you. I know that you have a good heart, you know, for a fact. So, yeah, maybe if... You know, if you can just give me some time to... Just give me some time to think... ...for what I'm gonna say or I can... You give me your address and I can write to you, for sure. Okay, okay. Yeah, and I will too. You know, I would... I will write. I'll write to you. I'm not just... I'm not gonna just say that. Okay. You know, because I owe, for that, at least. You know, I would owe you that much. Can I have a pen? A pen? Okay, I'll give you my e-mail. Oh... Okay. Okay. I made so many mistakes, you know, for the wrong reasons. I had a very addictive personality. You know, especially for gambling. And for... If I tell a lie... Or, you know, do other stuff, it's... It... To get the money for the gambling. And that, you know, for sure... ...like, that's the main reason... ...why, you know, I do the things that I did... ...and how horrible they were. But I will write, you know. I will write to you, for sure. I mean... ...I don't really understand. Please. Just tell me what happened. Let me take her home. Yeah. Yeah, because I'll write to you. I just... I need some... I need some time to think. You know, just about what I'm going to say. And to put there in the letter. You took everything from me. My child. My husband, my job, my whole life. I never mourned my baby because of you. Well, maybe that was my fault. Because I have been hunting you. But I can see now. You're ugly. You're everything my daughter wasn't. I'm not gonna waste another breath on you. I hope you never get another night's sleep. I hope you never close your eyes in peace again. You have nothing I want. Nothing. I've gotta go. I'm gonna go. L... I can't hate him anymore. I'm done. That's it. I'm done. Okay. Bye. Bye.
