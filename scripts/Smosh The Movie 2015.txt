We're stepping in the ring And won't let that lady sing It's over when we say it's over Been brushing off our shoulders It's not a twist of fate We choose our own destiny A trophy or a bruise Champions never lose I was at the mall the other day, and this girl was wearing pants that looked like she literally pooped in them. Look at us. We look like two girls at a club. Hey... Aw... Ah! More videos. More videos! More videos! What are you waiting for? It's time to show the world What they've waited for Something like they've never seen before Hey. Seen before We're just getting started We're just getting started Hello, little guy. Cheese mobile! Check it out! It's time to show the world What they've waited for Something like they've never seen before Lame. Lame. Lame. We're just getting started Just getting started My eyes are, like, must be 50 pounds or something, man. Whoa! That was fake. Hey, I apologize. That's all you can ask for. - You suck. - I apologize! Sweet! Hey, man. Hey, dude. Uh, glad you're here 'cause I need a ride. Oh, I knew it. You can't keep doing this. You can't just order a pizza every time you need a ride somewhere, okay? Why not? You're already out driving around. Plus my mom started charging me for rides. - What's the big deal? - The big deal is I'm a working professional now and you need to respect that. You deliver pizzas. I work in food distribution for a multi-million dollar company. Where you deliver pizzas. Look, I've worked very hard to turn my life around in a very short amount of time. Unlike you, I moved out of my parents' house. Into my parents' house. Hi, boys. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Hecox. So will you both be home for dinner tonight? - Yeah. - I can't. I'm fasting to fit my... my new pair of jeggings I just got. - Okay. - Oh. - Yup. - Bye, Mom and Dad. - Uh-huh. - Bye, Son. Bye. Thank you. Look, I've got a good job. I don't know why you can't see that. Would we call it good? $25 haircut, dude. I used to only ever pay, like, 10. My life is like a rocket ship right now... going nowhere but up. Yeah, I know you better than that, dude. You're still the same old Anthony who imagines Stone Cold Steve Austin complimenting him in the mirror. No, I grew out of talking to him, like, forever ago. You're working too hard, man. You're out there delivering pizzas for, like, two hours a day. It's high time you did something for yourself. Oh, yeah, like give you a ride somewhere? I mean, I wasn't thinking that, but, that would be great. Yeah. Let me guess. You want to go to the Game Bang. All right, there he is. That's my boy. Come on. Let's do this. Yeah. Whoo! Yeah! Yo, Anthony. You're doing a hell of job balancing such as busy - and complex life. - Yeah, I know. But you got to start working your glutes man. Looks like a loose lump of Play-Doh down there. - Looks bad. - Yeah, okay. I'll, um, I'll just do some squats on my way out. Thanks. That pizza? Yeah, that'll be 10 bucks, by the way. Oh, dude, that's messed up. You're gonna charge your best friend? Did Steve Jobs give free iPhones away to his friends? Nope. Um, you're not the CEO of pizza. Not yet. Look at that dumb car. $1.00. - That's it? - Yup. I said 10 bucks. Well, you know, I'm a cheap ass. Ready to get your game bang on? Mm! Hey, cool car dickheads. Yeah, that is a cool car. You know why? 'Cause it gets me this. - What? - That's cold hard cash, son. What do you have to show for what you've done today, punks? He just dropped some money on the ground, - he doesn't even care. - Oh. - What? - Really? - That's it? - For real. - You see this watch? - Yeah. I won it playing skeeball. Jesus, is that real? 5 carats, yo. No one wears watches anymore. Come on, like, all you got to do is look up at the sun. Like, right now, it's, uh, 4:0... 4:05. - Yeah. Yeah. - Deal with it. Loser. Uhh! Yeah, that's a pole. You know, we've been coming to this place since we were, like, eight. We should be out doing cooler stuff. - Like what? - Like meeting girls. Like other stuff people do that are our age. Um, no can do. I'm kind of seeing someone. Uh, no you're not. You leave creepy comments on a YouTube video of a hot girl getting her butt massaged. That's, uh, that's not the same thing as seeing someone. Do I see her? Look, you never even talk to her. She's flagged every single one of my comments. Yeah, for being a perv. No, man. She's just playing hard to get. Pocket Slave Monsters - You now work for me - Dude, look what it is. Magic Pocket Slave Monsters. Come on. Dude, I can't believe they got this thing. - Do you remember this? - Yellow rat. I choose you against your will. Ah! Now get out there and murder your friends. Ah! Oh, it's a lot more violent than I remember. What? No, dude, it was always like this. I want to be the master I want to flip the switch I want to capture all these guys How lame. And make each one my bitch Stop! Stop! Please. - Come on, man. - What? - Dude, this was our jam. - What? We used to love the game and the TV shows and the erotic fan fiction. - Oh, yeah. - Uh, yeah. That was a long time ago, Ian. Not really into that kind of stuff anymore. Losers. Come on! Did you see those girls? Come on, dude. You loved it. I'm worried about you, man. I don't think you're living in the real world. The real world sucks. The real world is actually pretty amazing. So, the kids that are probably taking a dump on the cheese mobile, they're amazing? And what about all the girls that are walking around that aren't talking to you? Are they amazing? And these girls would talk to me if you weren't here dancing to the theme song from Magic Pocket Slave Monsters. Then who wants them? I do! Look, I got to go. My ten minutes are up. - I'm still on the clock. - What? - Have fun. - Wait. Dude, how am I supposed to get home? Sorry, one of us has a job here. Just take a cab or something. I'll be home after my shift. Do it, do it! Do it! Do it! Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it! Hey, get off my cheese mobile. Run! Oh, my God. Yeah, get out of here. Punks. Do you have a name for your butt? May I suggest, "Perfect"? Hey, Ian? You've been seeing that girl for a few months now. When do we get to meet her? I don't know, Mom. We're not rushing into anything. - Bye. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - She seems lovely. She's amazing. Son... just... make sure she's not a dude. Unless you're into that sort of thing. In which case, it's totally cool. Okay. Great talk, Dad. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, I, uh... We haven't gotten our mail in, like, three months. What gives? Yeah, you might want to ask your little friend about that. - Who Ian? - The bowl-headed idiot with the face you just want to punch? - Yeah. Ian. - Yeah, I'm done delivering mail to this house. You want your mail? Oh, you want your mail. - Okay. - Yeah. Let me get you your mail. Here's your mail. You want your mail? - Oh! - There's your mail. You must want your package, too. Here's your package. From now on, you get your mail at the post office. Hey, what did you do to the mailman? Nothing. Why? You know what you did. Seriously, man? Butt Massage Girl again? She's my girlfriend and she has a name, you know. Oh, really? What is it? I don't know, but I'm sure she has one. You know nothing about that girl. Uh, she likes butt massages. I know that. What does her face look like? Like a butt. I think. Look, it doesn't matter. We're a thing. Sure, our love is maybe a little unconventional, but it's real. Nice! She really cares about me. Dude, we got some letters here. If it's from my grandma, check for Anthrax. Dude, we got an invite to our five-year high school reunion. Really? When is it? It is... tonight. Cool. You do realize what this means, right? Free tacos? Yeah, free tacos, but more importantly... Anna Reed's probably gonna be there. Ugh, Anna Reed? What is it with you and this girl, man? All right, fine. Get it over with. All throughout high school, Anna Reed was the only girl I'd dream about. She was the girl of my dreams. They'll buff our feet. It's gonna be awesome. You know, I was so awkward back then I didn't know how to talk to girls. Anthony. Bye. Hey. Hi... hey... What's up? So, um, this weekend, I'm doing the Moonwalk for Ring Finger Largeasia. I'm moonwalking 37 miles to raise awareness for people whose ring finger is longer than their pointer finger. It's a very important cause and one that's dear to my heart, because, see, my Uncle Keith, he died of it. Jesus, that's... I'm really sorry for your loss. Would you wanna sponsor me? Uh, um... I mean, if you can't because of the money, that's totally fine. No, no, I have a ton of money. Oh, great! Actually, that's a lie. I don't... I only have 5 bucks and that's my porn money... corn money! That's my corn money. Oh, well, that's okay. Um, maybe you could just join me and we could moonwalk together. I could use the moral support. It's probably gonna take me a couple of weeks. 37 miles, you said? Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I'll do it. You will? - Yeah. Yeah. - Amazing! Cool. - Whoa! - Oh! Dude, seriously? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then you wussed out and you never showed up to the Moonwalk. Dude, I've heard this story a million times. What's your point? That this reunion is the perfect opportunity to make Anna forget about how big of losers we used to be, you know, show her how cool we are now? Are we cooler now than we were in high school? Uh, $25 haircut, dude. Here, I need to check the reunion page to see if Anna's going. It says to dress for mall. We dress for the mall every day. No, it's saying "dress formal. " It means we have to rent tuxedos. Yeah, I know that. Oh, well, guess she's not going. So, about the tux rentals, we should probably get on that. It doesn't say that, okay? She's going. She just hasn't replied yet. Okay? I can feel it. Look, someone posted a video on here. Have you thought about life insurance lately? Because here at All-Chafe, we want to protect your family from your impending death. Ugh, I hate advertisements. Skip it. If you don't buy All-Chafe Insurance, there's a good chance your entire family will be dead by next week. Buffering? That still exists? Everybody put your hands together. Whoo-hoo! Is Magic Pocket Slave Monsters the best song ever? Dude, that's you. Cool! Anna Reed, get up here, get up here, Anna Reed. Right there. I really want you to see this. Hit it, Mr. Ellis! I wanna be the master I wanna flip the switch Dude, that's awesome, you're... You're, like, doing flips and stuff, kind of. Whoa! My butt! Oh, no. God, I can't believe this is happening to me right now. Well, I mean, it's not happening to you right now. It happened five years ago. Look at the views. There's 301 views. That's like the entire attendance of a football stadium. You know, in a small town with a high school team whose record is, like, five and five, and they're not terrible, but they're not great, and they're losing a lot of close games... Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. I get it. If Anna sees this video, it's gonna remind her about how much of a loser I used to be. And the fact that I'm super-cool now won't even matter. I can't go to this reunion now. I have to stay here at home and never know if kissing Anna really feels like licking a wet donut. All right, dude, if you don't go, I don't go. Mostly 'cause I don't have a car. And will it hurt to miss out on free tacos? Sure it will. Like a son of a bitch. But you're my best friend, and I got your back. - Thanks. - Okay, we're not giving up yet. Anna Reed hasn't replied to the invite yet, right? So, she probably hasn't been to the page. She probably hasn't even seen the video. You're right. So all we have to do is... - Is go to the reunion. - go and get the video removed from YouTube before Anna sees the video. What? Thank you for calling YouTube. This is Stephanie. How may I direct your call? Hi, Stephanie. My name is Anthony Padilla, and I have a very important issue I'd like your help with. I need a video removed and never shown on your website ever again. Okay. Are you a rich and powerful corporation that can threaten us with legal action? - No. - Then I can't help you. Good-bye. Didn't work. Well, that doesn't really matter, dude. The video's awesome. It won't be awesome when Anna sees it. I think I have an idea. This is never gonna work. If you want something done right, you just talk to the right people. And you got to look them dead in the eye and beg. Hey, do me a favor, let me do all the talking. Okay? Your people skills are terrible. What are you talking about? I have amazing people skills Oh, let me get that. Ah! - Oh! - Ah! Aah! I am so glad that happened. That was the funniest thing I've seen all day. Good day, sir. Good day, sir. I did that. I did that. Hi there, darling. I am a very important, big, rich CEO of a powerful company. And I am his boss. Well, now, Ian, a CEO does not have a boss, okay? I beg to differ, Anthony, because I am the CFO and that's one letter higher than CEO. Well, Ian, you must've misheard me, because I'm actually the CEOO, which has one more letter, so it's more important. Hey! It's you. I know you. You're the kid from that crazy video You're the Backflip Microphone Guy! It's the guy! This guy. You know it. She got it. She knows what it is. Okay, that's actually why we're here. Okay, I have a question for you. When you regained consciousness, and you fell off the stage and you landed on the mic, did the whole thing go up your ass? Or was it some sort of, like, special effects wizardry? Okay, can we just keep it down, please? Okay, 'cause I was watching with my husband... Sorry, taken. And he was like, "Where'd the microphone go?" And I was like, "I think it's in that boy's ass. " Okay, that's enough, okay? You will not take that tone with me. You're right. I'm sorry. Okay? It's just that my friend and I have a very important issue we need to discuss. It's a matter we'd like to take up directly with the CEO of this establishment, if you don't mind. So, is Mr. YouTube available to see us right now? Mr. YouTube? Yup, we're going straight to the top. Okay, first of all, the CEO of YouTube is not just gonna sit down with two random guys off the street. And even if he did, I'm pretty sure the guy's name is not "Mr. YouTube. " Mr. YouTube will see you now. His office is just at the end of that hallway. Really? I don't care what Billy Snapchat says. Billy Snapchat is a little bitch. I'm Steve YouTube. What I say goes. No, I had lunch with Sally Instagram three days ago. She and Roger Facebook are in. Now, if you don't want to get on board with this, then you are a stupid jerk idiot. Sorry for the French. All right, I got to go. I've got two random guys in my office I've never met before, and they need something from me. And I can't keep them waiting. Good-bye. Good-bye! Sorry about that. That was Ted Google. Guy's been a pain in my butt ever since he bought my company. Hi. Steve YouTube. Pleasure to meet you. - Hi. - I don't touch. I don't touch. I'm Ian and this is... Backflip Microphone Guy! Dude, that is one of my all-time favorite videos. What can I do for you guys? Well, Mr. YouTube... Oh, no, no, no. Please. Call me Steve. YouTube. Call me Steve YouTube. Okay. So, Steve YouTube, I need that thing... - Awesome video. - Shh. I need that thing that you mentioned... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the video. - Hilarious, right? - Hilarious. Shut... uuuup. Okay, so, yeah, I need that video removed from your website, please. Ah, yes, yeah. I got to be honest with you guys. This thing... this kind of thing happens more than you would imagine. Not the microphone thing. But the embarrassment thing. And here's the problem. Once a video is uploaded to the Internet, it's there forever. Your best bet is to actually go into YouTube itself and change the video from the inside. So you mean, like, go into YouTube, like, Tron-style? No, you're messing with us, right? - There's... you... what is this? - Yeah, that's not... - That's not possible. - That doesn't sound possible. Hey, guys, I'm Steve Friggin' YouTube. If I say you can get up inside YouTube, then you can get up inside YouTube. I did not mean for that to sound sexual. I apologize. What I should have said is, if you wanna penetrate YouTube... That was worse. You know what? Forget it. My point is this. I have to do this kind of thing for people all the time. You guys remember Gangnam style? Do you remember that video by that... I think it was a Puerto Rican guy? - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. Well, you think Psy nailed that video on the first take? Nope. I actually think I have the original video right here. Check it out. Hey, sexy lady Up, up, up Up, oh Gangnam style It's so bad. Right? I mean, there's not even a dancing horse. How hard is it to get a horse to dance? Probably not that hard. It's very hard. No, no, no, this is perfect. This is perfect. So how do we, uh, get inside YouTube to fix our video? Great question. Simple answer. There's actually a portal right under my desk. - A portal? - That doesn't sound right. This, um, this doesn't seem safe. Guys, it's me, Steve, YouTube. Steve YouTube. If I say there's a portal under my desk that will get you into YouTube, there's a portal under my desk. It just kind of seems like, you know, we might crawl down there, and you might have your wiener out or, some... - Excuse me? - Definitely your wiener. Excuse me. I don't know what kind of meeting you thought this was. Frankly, I find that suggestion offensive. I'm Steve YouTube. I created all of this. You think I would jeopardize that by putting my, what did you say, "wiener" out? I don't think so. Now, look, I'm very busy. You guys can see yourselves out. If you don't wanna change the video, you don't wanna change the video. Janice, get me Bethany MySpace on the phone, please. No, no, no I... It's cool. We're gonna do it. We're gonna change our video. - Yeah, just crawl... - Really? - All right. - Yeah, go right around - the desk and crawl under. - Let's do it, man. And go to the portal. - Whoa! - Oh my... - What? - Dude! That! - Damn it! Put it away! - Oh! That's not... You thought there was a portal under my desk, and you saw my wiener. That is the best joke ever. So there's no portal, then. You're just messing with us. Of course there's a portal. But it's not under my desk, you morons. It's behind my closet door. - Go on. - Okay. Yeah, it's just right there. Go on in. Um, yeah, this doesn't feel very safe either. Guys, I had my fun, okay, but fun time's over. Not everything in life is a wiener joke. Holy shit! - Whoo! - Whoa! Take these. What do we do with these? Gentlemen, meet Diri. She'll be your guide once you're on the inside. Hello, Ian. Hello Anthony. I hope I can be of service to you both. Wait, her name is "Diri"? That's right. She's a personal assistant software. - So she's like Siri? - Hey. Hey. We don't draw that comparison here. - You understand me? - It's just that... Hey, Bieber, you understand me? Diri and Siri, it's kind of... It's... it does kind of sound similar. People are gonna draw the conclusions. - It sounds... - I'm gonna have my R&D team take a look at that. Now listen to me. Diri is gonna be your guide once you get through that portal. Anyplace you need to go, you tell Diri, she will take you there. Like, Siri. Okay. Cool. Cool-cool. All right. Safe travels, gentlemen. You sure you want to do this? Yeah. If I don't do this, I'll never be anything to Anna. All right. I'm with you. - Ready? - Yeah. Yeah. - B. - F. F. Let's go. Let's do it. - Ready? - Yeah. - Let's do this. - You first. Good luck! What the hell is this, dude? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, man. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Look out below! Whoo! Whoo! Did we do it? Are we in YouTube? I don't know. It doesn't really feel like YouTube. Have you thought about life insurance lately? 'Cause here at All-Chafe, we wanna protect your family from your impending death. Yup, we're definitely in YouTube. It's this friggin' advertisement. If you don't buy All-Chafe Insurance, - there's a good chance... - Diri, can we skip this ad, please? Sure. Let me help you with that. Uh, yeah, Diri, could you also go full screen? 'Cause we can't see zilch. Certainly. I can do that. That's better. Diri, where are we? Anthony, you are in a bear attack video. Diri, get us out of here. You said, "Get me a beer. " Is that correct? What? No! I said, get us out of here! Aah! Hello, everybody. My name is Markiplier. And welcome to Gorilla Chainsaw Massacre. As you can see, I'm a pissed-off gorilla with a chainsaw. Doesn't really make a lot of sense, but then again, I don't really care. Diri, help! Taking you to Yelp. Leave a review online. - What? - I hate you. A gorilla with a chainsaw. I don't have a full grasp on human speech, but I can operate a gas-powered chainsaw? Oh, God! Diri, get us out of here now! There is no reason to yell at me. Die, puny humans, die! - Ah! - Oh! Wait, are we... I think we're home. Diri, what the hell is your problem? I'm a piece of intelligent software, not a mind reader. And I would greatly appreciate if you would refrain from using expletives. Don't think that just because you're super-hot, you don't have to be specific. - What? - What? Anthony, check this out. Here's your pizza. I remember this video. I shot it three months ago. Such an idiot. You're looking pretty hot, yourself. Call me up later, right? You wanna see a little skin? It's gonna blow your mind. No, I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to take off my shirt, but, uh... give you a little bit of that... You were filming this? I was bored. Hey, boys. - Hi. - Hi. This is so weird. Yeah. Yeah, I work out my glutes. Just imagine this in jeggings. Mailman. Oh, dude. Check this out. What are you doing behind that tree? Just watch. Here it comes. Take this, Mailman! Yeah! Yeah! Take it! Yeah! Dude, I have to wear this all day. Deal with it, bitch. Yeah! Ha-ha! Oh, man. Yeah! Well, this explains why the mailman stopped delivering our mail. God, I'm so funny. Milk balloons. Classic Ian. It was kind of a jerk move, dude. Come on, man. We used to do milk balloons all the time. Yeah, when we were kids. You little bastard. Okay, okay. We get it. Do you realize what this means? Yeah. I should've used bigger balloons. That guy was barely soaked. No, no, no! The mailman punched you in the face, right? Yeah. That means we can actually interact with these videos. Oh, yeah, you're right. All right, so I'm gonna get some bigger balloons and more milk... No, no, no, no. Just stay focused, man. Come on. Diri, take us to our graduation night video. It's time for some redemption. I am now taking you to Jenna Marbles. Wait, what? Now she's just screwing with us. Listen, if you're a guy and you're wearing eyeliner, not like Halloween eyeliner or anything like that, like all-day, everyday eyeliner, I got news for you. It's hot. I like that. Keep doing what you're doing. What the hell, man? Diri, damn it! Jenna, I'm really sorry, okay? Just forget we were ever here. - We'll just be on our way. - Hold on. Jenna, it's me, Big Rod 91. I've commented on a bunch of your videos. Oh, yeah! I know exactly who you are! You kidding me? No idea. Okay Jenna, actually, this is gonna sound crazy, but Steve... Steve sent you here to fix some crappy video that you guys messed up on. That right? - Yeah. - Yeah. And then he gave you these phones, but Diri's being an unhelpful little bitch. - Oh, my God, yes! - Yeah, I know. Screw you, Jenna. Whatever. I know a shortcut. Just use the web address for the video. You don't even need Diri if you just type in the web address to the video that you want to go to. Wait, hold on. We don't know the address. That's gonna take forever to guess. Yeah, Jenna. That's a dumb idea. - Bitch. - Yeah. Well, then I don't know what to tell you. But whatever you're gonna do, you got to do it quick. - Why? - Steve didn't tell you? See, these phones and Diri are your only link to the outside world. And if the battery life dies, you get stuck in YouTube. - Forever. Just like me. - Wait, what? Hey, Jenna, seen my hair scrunchie? No, I haven't seen your scrunchie, bitch. Are you kidding me? She looks ridiculous in those. I don't even know why she wears them. She's not even hot. She's like a six. Look at her. Nasty. Don't tell me what to wear, bitch. What did you just say to me? Come and say it to my face! - You know what, bitch... - Okay, I know you really want to fix that video, but we can't get stuck in here, dude. We just need to go back. We're gonna be fine. We have plenty of battery power left. This is my only chance. So we're just gonna guess random addresses? Yeah, okay? The address for the grad night video started with YouTube. com/something... I got it. Let's split up. It always works in the movies. This isn't a movie, okay? It's real life. We can't just split up. Well just, can you just trust me on this? You know, okay, fine. We'll meet back in 15 minutes. How about that? - I hope this works. - Of course it'll work. - Ready? - Yup. - Put your address in. - Hello? You're acting like I'm not even here. Shut up, Diri. - All right. Ready? Got it in? - Yup. - All right. - And... Three, two, one, go! What the hell is this? Oh, God, no! Oh, okay. Welcome to the party, bro! Hey, you forgot your costume! - Don't even sweat it. - What? You're a kitty. Bunny twerk, bunny twerk, - What? Oh! Oh, God! - Bunny twerk, bunny twerk! - No! Oh! Oh! - Bunny twerk, bunny twerk! Bunny twerk. Oh, my God, I remembered the right address. Hello, there. Aah! Who the hell are you? It's me, Big Rod 91. Your boyfriend. You flag all my comments. Oh, my goodness. Big Rod 91? I'm sorry about flagging all your comments. I was playing hard to get. I knew it. What are you doing here? Oh, it's a long story. Well, pull up a table. We've got time. Okay. If you want the best taste you've ever seen, go out and get yourself some Stone Cold Creamy Cream. And that's the bottom line. Stone Cold Steve Austin? - Oh, my God, it's me, Anthony. - Who? You know, we talk in the mirror all the time. Wait, you sell ice cream now? Yeah, it's my new gimmick. Stone Cold Creamy Cream. It's the best. Don't you think people will get that confused with Cold Stone Creamery? Never heard of it. Anyway, so I have a problem I need your help with. I embarrassed myself in front of this girl I love by doing a flip and then landing directly on my face, and then getting a microphone shoved up my... Mm. That's not good. Yeah. So now I need her to think I'm cool again. What would you do if you were me? Well, I'll tell you exactly what I'd do. I'd hit her with the Stone Cold Stunner. Oh, my God, of course you would. - That's your move, man. - Exactly. Yeah, so you're basically saying I should come up with my own move. Not try to impress her, but just be myself. No. I'm telling you, you need to hit her with the Stone Cold Stunner. Maybe even from a top rope. Right. So I need to climb to the top rope too, and not be afraid of falling. And I'll never know what I'm capable of if I don't just get out there and try. No, that's not what I'm saying! I'm telling you to grab her by that stack of dimes she calls a neck, drop her ass with a Stone Cold Stunner. Yes! Oh, my God. Stone Cold Steve Austin, you're the best. I can always count on you. Oh, why didn't I think of that? Kid's on 'shrooms. Stop. I can't stand the silent treatment anymore. Take me back, Anthony, and I'll do better, I promise. One final chance, that's all I'm asking for. Okay, fine. One final chance. Okay? Take me to Rockville High Graduation Night 2009. Sure, I can help you with that. See? It was that easy. Damn it, Diri, this is not what I asked for and you know it. But this is it. It's Rockville High Graduation Night, 2009. - I swear. - Anna? Who is Anna? Hi, everybody, or, you know, the three people that actually watch my stupid vlogs. Mom, Dad, Uncle Keith's ghost, tonight is graduation night. I can't believe it's really her. She's getting ready for the graduation party. Anthony, we need to talk. Shh. No, we don't. So, I did the Moonwalk for Ring Finger Largeasia last weekend. 37 miles. The doctor says I'm never gonna walk right again. But some things are worth the sacrifice. So there's this guy at school, um, he was supposed to meet me for it, but he didn't show up. And it's weird because I really thought we had something. I don't know. I like the guy but... I guess moonwalking 37 miles would be a pretty weird first date. That was supposed to be a date? Maybe he'll be at the party tonight, and we'll see if there's something there. Otherwise, I am totally fine with talking to you three fine people out in internet land, until you get bored of me. And also, I've prepared a statement for those victims of Ring Finger Largeasia. Don't ignore me, Anthony. Stop it! This is Anna Reed! The girl I'm in love with. The whole reason I came into YouTube in the first place. I think I just found out she's in love with me, too. Wow, you're easy. What is that supposed to mean? What does she have that I don't have? Uh, a body, and a face, for starters. Sincerely, Anna Reed. Let's get out of here. Who's there? Uh, Uncle Keith's ghost. - Uncle Keith? - We have to go now! You are never going to find your video. It is no wonder that Ian does not value your friendship. Of course he does. Oh, really? Uncle Keith was a furry? Oh, man, this feels great. Is it weird to say that I want this guy's hand on my butt all the time? A little bit. Ian? What are you doing? Oh, hey, man, check it out! It's Butt Massage Girl. You were supposed to be out looking for the graduation night video! What happened? Maybe you didn't hear me, but I found Butt Massage Girl. Dude, she's amazing. We're kind of in love. Hey, I know you. You're Backflip Microphone Guy. We've been watching your video all day. You showed her that? Well, I mean, it's a good video. Why wouldn't I? I mean, there you go. - It's so cute, dude. - It's so cute. Oh, my God, dude, it's up to 748 views now. That's like the entire attendance of a football stadium in a slightly bigger town with a high school team whose record is like, - eight and two, and you know... - This is why I like you. they started the season off as underdogs, so they, somehow, keep winning. They're selling tickets like crazy and... We get it, dude. Ian, we have the video address now. It's right here. We have to go now before Anna sees the video. But... But, but, but, but, but, - Butt Massage Girl. - This is serious, dude. It turns out, Anna is in love with me, too. Oh. But, but... Butt Massage Girl. We have to fix that video and get to the reunion more now than ever. Come on! But I wanna stay here with her. Dude, it's meant to be, see? Ian, come on, man. This isn't even real. It's just a video. Our love is real. I mean, we got our butts massaged together. Look. Butt Massage Girl? Who the hell are you? - It's me. - You who? Big Rod 91. Oh, my goodness, it's really you? Yeah. Ian, I know this is hard, but we only have 24% of our battery life left. Okay? We need to go now. All right. Fine. But, Big Rod 91... Good-bye, Butt Massage Girl. I have a name, you know. Shh! Don't say it. - It'll ruin the romance. - It's... Shh! Go, go! La, la, la, la. Go now, go now, go now! Massage my butt! This is it! Yeah, I mean, it's great and all, but it has been a couple minutes, and I could really use another butt massage. Shh! Keep it down. Can't draw attention to ourselves. Whoa... whoa... Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa... Dude, seriously? Aah! What kind of a dumbass just leaves that stuff laying around? Not like a bad dumbass. Like a... good dumbass. Way to not draw attention! There she is. Look at her. And there we are. Man, we were such losers. Look at my stupid haircut. It only cost 10 bucks. Ah! Whoo! Okaaaaaay, graduates! Helloooo! Are we all having a good time tonight? I forgot how much this place sucked. Is every-body havin' a good time tonight? Ooooooh! - Lame! - Okay! - We hate you! - All right, coming up on stage right now to sing the theme song from Magic Pocket Slave Monsters. Really? Uh, everybody put your hands together for Anthony Padi... Pa... dilla... - B... - F... F! - We need to stop him! - Go, go, go. Me. The... the guy who's also me. - Thanks, Mr. Ellis. - Mm-hmm. You rock, Anthony! Is Magic Pocket Slave Monsters the best song ever? Yes! Yes, yes. Whoo! All right. We need a plan, and we need a plan quick. Let's do this! Well, I mean, you could go up there and knock him out. I'm too tough to knock out. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whoo, whoo, whoo. Is that you? - Huh? - That guy, right there! - Is that you? - Um... Is it me? It's really hard to tell. You are the only one recording this here tonight. Even if it was me, I definitely wasn't recording it. Dude, I was probably just taking a selfie. "Selfie" wasn't even a term in 2009. Anna Reed's in the house, y'all Anna Reed's in the house, what? Anna Reed, come on up. Yeah. All right. I really want you to see this. Look me dead in the eye and tell me you are not the one that recorded this and uploaded it. Obviously, it wasn't me, okay? Hey, guys, I'm totally recording this, and then I'm gonna put it up on YouTube in five years, probably right before our five-year high school reunion. Okay, it was me. But I didn't do it to embarrass you. I did it 'cause I thought your flip was awesome. Hit it, Mr. Ellis. I wanna be the master I wanna flip the switch - Oh! - Hoo hoo hoo... That was awesome! Look! You almost made it all the way around that time. And the crowd was super into it... see? You made them all so happy. Okay, I'm sorry, but I didn't see how this could backfire. Why would you do that to me? I thought you needed a little reminder on how funny you used to be. I'm still fun. Not like you used to be. You used to be the best person in the world to hang out with. Then you got a job and an expensive haircut and you moved out of your parents' house, and now it's like you're embarrassed to do all the stuff we used to do together. You're just jealous you don't have the awesome new life that I have. You didn't even want to come here to YouTube and help me in the first place, and you're the one that uploaded this! And ever since we got in here, all you wanted to do is try to pick up on your stupid little Butt Massage Girl. Don't bring Butt Massage Girl into this. See that guy over there? That's my friend. - Oh! - Oh! My butt! Ha ha ha! Where did the microphone go, guys? Oh, it's really deep in there. That's my friend! This video's gonna go viral. Oh! Can we get a doctor? That's my friend. That's the guy I cared about before he stopped liking cool stuff. People change, Ian. Get over it. Take my haircut, for instance. Okay... your haircut looks exactly the same as it did five years ago! Just 'cause you pay more for it doesn't make it a better haircut. Fight. Fight. Shut up, Diri! Stop! You're just gonna make this worse! - No... give it back, dude! - Stop! What... Oh... baby! - Oh! - Uhh! - Stop! - No! Stop it! - You're a terrible friend! - No, you are! Huh? No! God, what... - No... - No! Seriously, dude, no! No... ah! My mouth is full of rainbows! Wait... is that guy high? Tooth fairy's gonna make me rich! Oh, God, he just had his wisdom teeth taken out! Oh, God... Let go of the wheel! You're gonna get us killed! Let go... come on! I have 11 fingers! - Aah! - Aah! - Get off me! - Let go! Aw... Look at the cute little kitty! Hey, little guy! Wait! B-b-bucket... Whoa... whoa... Whoa, whoa, whoa... Dude, seriously? Damn it! Sorry. Please don't hurt us. Aah! Okay, look, you're right. I have been a jerk lately. I know I should have come clean right away about the video, but... once I saw your reaction to it, I knew you'd be pissed. I screwed up. I'm sorry. Why don't you guys make out already? Anthony, let's get out of here. - Screw this guy. - Diri, can you just shut up? Okaaaaay, graduates! Helloooo! Are we all having a good time tonight? Lame! We hate you. Okay. You know what? I'm gonna make this up to you. I got you into this mess, and I'm gonna get you out of it. Wait... where are you going? Let him go. It's just you and me now, Dreamy Eyes. What did you just call me? You heard me, you sexy little bitch. Put your hands together for Anthony. Anthony Padillo! Give him a hand. Thanks, Mr. Ellis. You rock, Anthony. Is Magic Pocket Slave Monster the best song ever? Hey, you got up here really fast. I'm sorry, man. Ouch! Ow! Ow! What are you trying to do? I'm trying to knock you out so you don't embarrass yourself. Huh? Told you I don't go down that easy. - Here you go. - Thanks! Are you seeing what I'm seeing? Either I'm seeing what you're seeing, or somebody spiked the punch bowl with LSD. It's not. I made the punch, and I only spiked it with vodka. What should I do? Should I go up there and help him? That's what a good friend would do, I guess. You're right. How are you so tough to knock out, man? Is your head made of steel? Give it to him! Stop hitting my friend! Aah! Fight! Fight, fight, fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Come on! Ian, look! We only have 5% power left. We have to get out of here. What about fixing the video? Forget it, it's too late. Diri, get us to the portal now. You said, "Is my Mom infertile?" Let me check on that for you. That's not what I said! You know that's not what I said. Damn it, Diri, this is not the time for games, okay? If we don't get back to that portal now, we're gonna be stuck here in YouTube forever. And you would just hate that, wouldn't you? Stuck in here with me for the rest of your life. Shut up, Diri, this isn't about you. You shut up, Ian. You have poisoned the mind of my dear Anthony. What is it with you guys? First, you idiots barge into my office off the street, asking for favors. I am gracious enough to listen, but then you won't even laugh at my wiener jokes, even though they are super funny. Wait. Steve... is that you? Uh... no, this is Diri. I'm just some computer software guiding you guys around. I'm definitely not Steve YouTube, whoever that is. I mean, I've heard of Steve YouTube, of course. His wiener comedy is legendary. Steve, dude, we know it's you, okay? All right, fine. It's me, Steve. YouTube... Steve YouTube. Too bad you didn't figure it out and hour ago, because now I've got you trapped. You're gonna live forever in YouTube, making jackasses of yourselves in videos. People love watching jackasses doing stupid things. It's our bread and butter here at YouTube. And now, you're mine forever. I knew that guy was a weirdo. You're the weirdo! We have to get back to that portal. Anna is waiting for me on the other side. Good luck trying to find the portal without me to lead you there. It's impossible. Hoo hoo hah hah hah! Hold on. Wait, I have an idea. What if we went into the viewing history and followed the videos backwards? That should lead us back to the portal, right? No, that won't work. I mean, that definitely won't work, I wouldn't even... don't even try that. We have to try the viewing history, it's the only chance we've got... come on! You are gonna regret this. You are messing with the wrong super successful billionaire. Oh! Found it. Let's go. Fine, you want to run from me? I'm up for the challenge. Here we go. That's not it. That's not it. Is that it? Oh... there it is. There it is. Let's do this. Jerks. All right. I gotta get my VR suit on. Oh! Shoot me... ow. My thigh. All right, I'm just gonna get my VR suit... oh, shoot. Hold on, guys. Guys... I just dropped my globe. I just got a little bit turned around, guys. Got it. Don't go anywhere. Oh, Jesus. There it is. My VR suit is in here. Soon as I put that on, you're dead. So I just gotta change out of these clothes, get my VR suit on, then I'm gonna need a zip. Janice? I'm gonna need a zip! I'm putting the VR suit on, and I'm gonna need a zip in a second. Whoa. Aw. Aw, look at the cute little whiskers. Jesus. Kaboom! - Shiny. - Oh, God! You boys can't escape Steve YouTube! Dude, quick, get us out of here now! I'm trying! Oh. Oh, what's happening? I think Steve's trying to delete our history. Delete, delete, delete, delete. - Ian? - Hold on, hold on. Okay, five seconds. Butt Massage Girl. I know you're not real, but I want you to know I'm going to find the real you once I get out of here. - Dude. - I promise you. Come on. And we're gonna fall in real love, okay? And maybe one day, I'll be the one to massage that booty. I'd like that very much, Ian. Hoo hoo hah hah hah! Hoo hoo hah hah hah! You idiots think you can get ride of me and YouTube? I am YouTube, literally. Hey, everybody. Or, the three people that actually watch my stupid vlogs. Tonight is graduation night. I love you, Anna, and we'll be together some day, I promise. If you want the best taste you've ever seen, go out and get yourself some Stone Cold Creamy Cream and that's the bottom... - Ooh! - Ugh. So sorry, Stone Cold Steve Austin. I love you too. And your ice cream name is really confusing. Stone Cold Stun her ass, man. I love that guy. Dude! Why was this video in your viewing history? Sickos. Get us... no, no! All right, look. All I'm saying is that if you're a guy, right, and you're... Aw, watch the furniture! Oh, hi, Jenna. I think it's so hot that there are two of you, and that you're never getting out of here, and that you're mine forever! Screw you, Steve. All right, you two. I think we've had enough fun for one day. Time to end this. There it is. Oh, shoot. Got it. Die, stupid humans, die. Oh, crap. Dude, what the hell happened? The video's buffering. Ugh, see? This is one of my pet peeves. It's 2014. Why is there still buffering? Why hasn't this issue just been resolved years ago? It's an issue with the bandwidth, it's complicated. Let me see what I can do. Janice? Are you streaming videos? Can you turn off your AOL for a second? I'm having buffering problems. Aw, man, you're making it worse. Don't get all bitchy with me. I was just about to get you guys with a chainsaw. No, you weren't. Yeah, we were just about to jump to the next video, there's no way you would have gotten us in time. Wait until this thing stops buffering, and I will show you jerks. And still no one cares this gorilla can operate a chainsaw. Awesome! That's it. I'm coming in after you jerks. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Dude, the portal! Come on! - We're gonna make it. - Oh, are you? Steve, it's over, just let us pass. Nothing's over till I say it's over. I'm Steve. YouTube... I'm Steve YouTube. I win, you lose! Maybe if you two weren't so great at making complete jackasses out of yourselves, I wouldn't have even wanted you so bad. We were so close. You were so easy to manipulate, Backflip Microphone Guy. Steve, look behind you. No. Not gonna fall for that one. He's serious. Steve, listen! No, you listen. Aah! - Oh! - Oh, my... holy... Oh, my... holy... Oh! The bear! - Oh, my God! - Oh! Oh, my... What the fudd... oh! God! Come on, dude, we gotta go. - Aah! - Aah! Oh! We made it. We made it, man. Aw, man. That was a close one. He almost had us. Stranger danger, bro. Sometimes we forget. It was my fault, and I never should have made us go in there in the first place. It wasn't worth almost losing my hetero life partner over. What? You'd never lose me. And I'm sorry I was such a dick. It'll never happen again. All right? B... - F. - F. BFFs. - Burnt French fries. - What? Dude, that's not what that means. - It's not? - No. Big fat feet? No, that's... that... you're not even close, dude. Oh! Aw! Oh, I've got it. Booger flicking friends. No. Hey, it's them. Ma'am, I'm really sorry, but we had to let that bear eat Steve. He was kind of a dick. Run! What the hell are you talking about? Whoa! Aah! Come on! Ah! It's only, uh... 6:19, so we still have time to go home, change, and make the reunion. Where's your car? Uh, it... it was right there. It must have gotten towed. Yeah, great. You are the worst at parking. We won't ever let you go Can't take anymore I'm under control Uh, why are we stopped here? This isn't our house. Uh, yeah it is, man, it says right there on the mailbox, 91 Gerard Way. What? This is our address. Hello? Leave the door open in case we have to run. And grab something really sharp. Ah. Yeah. That's literally the opposite of sharp. There you are! Why aren't you dressed? You're gonna be late for the reunion. Butt Massage Girl? What are you doing here? For the last time, you're my boyfriend, and you should call me by my real name, which is... Shh! I'm your boyfriend? She's real, dude. Ian, did you hit your head? Wait, if this is our house, where'd we get the money? Are you serious? The Clone Fight video. What? Oh, my God. Are you guys on drugs? I'm drunk in love. This video of you guys became the biggest YouTube video of all time, Then you got the TV show, then you met the President, then you made the movie, and now there's even Clone Fight Ruins Grad Night on Broadway. Broadway... that's always been my dream. - We did it, man. - Yeah. We changed our entire lives with that single video. And I'm your boyfriend. Like, for real, that's not a joke? It's not a joke. Wait, that means Anna... that means Anna's here too, right? Anna! Anna, where are you? Who's Anna? My girlfriend, Anna Reed. You don't have a girlfriend. I don't? You have like, 30. - Nice! - Oh, my God, these... These are all my girlfriends? This is not a joke? These are all for me? These are all... Oh, my God, these are all my girlfriends.

I'm sorry, girls. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Bye. The reunion. I can still see Anna at the reunion, and I'm like, cool now, like, actually cool. And rich. And famous. Let's go. Hi, boys.

Oh, that must be the pizza. Pizza? Bavooki's Pizza. Aah! Oh. Awesome kick, bro. Wow. Hold on, you're Steve YouTube, right? It's pronounced "You-too-bay. " But you're the CEO of YouTube. No, I'm not. I do food distribution for a multi-million dollar company. Hmm. Wonder who the CEO of YouTube is now. I don't give a shit what Julian Twitter said. Julian Twitter's - a little bitch! - Yes, ma'am. Hey, you can tell Joey Amazon that I ordered my scrunchies two weeks ago. - Sorry, ma'am. - Next day shipping, my ass! I am so sorry for all the trouble, Mr. Pizza Delivery Man.

You were just... weird and quirky and only showered, like, once a week, but I liked that about you. It was like you had better things to worry about than your looks and basic hygiene. And now, you're like a guy who would spend $80 on a haircut. Look, I'm still the same guy, I swear. Anthony, you're wearing a tuxedo. I wore this tux 'cause I thought it's what you wanted. I'm sorry. It's just not. Mmm. I don't know why I'm eating tacos. They go straight to my butt. Oh, really? Yeah, that's horrible, right? Terrible. Hey. So? How'd it go? Well... I blew it. What?

You can do this, Anthony. Yeah. Yeah. Who here loves The Deadmau5? Boom.
