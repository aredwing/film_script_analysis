No...No...No. If you will come near me, then I will kill him. Please don't do this. It's very easy for me to bring down his wicket. Take him away. Let's pick him up and arrest. Come...come, getup. If he would have killed you, then? You don't scare? Who got scared, assume he is dead! What's your name? Gabbar Singh. Who has given you this name? There was no one to give name, so I gave this name to myself. And you know that, this Gabbar, put my name Sambha. Come with me. Hello Madam! Ramna Ji is in the market. 5 multiplies by 4 is equals to...? -20. Twenty of? -0. Carry...? Ramna Ji! Hello! I was waiting for you. Seems, this year you have a very good harvest. If we did not get justice, then it will be our last harvest. Where is Raghav and his team? As you said, I have taken signature of all the village people. These are the documents. Hari Narayan Ji told me all about your struggle... I promise you that, you will get justice. Bhairav's hooligans are coming, run and hide. Oh Krishna! -Uncle, I have seen Bhairav's hooligans. Not like always... this time, they are coming with many people. Regardless of how many people, we will not leave them.-Raghav. It's important that, first you stay alive. The legislation will do justice, give me a chance. Until then, will not do anything? She is right. They are more powerful than us. But, Uncle? -Raghav, don't be obstinate. Run... Run, quick... quickly run fast. Oh! My son... Hey you people! Will be good for you, if you.. ..tell me the address of Hari Narayan's People. You can't save this village, at least, save your own life. Come out... Your death is coming, the king, Bhairav Singh. Oh no, no! My daughter... You people are fighting for these villagers... ... so if you dare, then come and save her, she is crying. If you do not come out, then you'd be responsible for her death. My daughter...my daughter! Listen Mr. Ramna Rao! I like to have deal of this land. I'm not interested in putting this on my forehead. From this land I will get benefit of millions. For this I have given money to government officers. Then why you people oppose it unnecessarily? This is our ancestor's land, where will go, by leaving this? You are living here for only 60 years.. ..you are saying that this is your ancestor's land. But previously, till many millions of years.. ..this land was under our royal family. How I can forget that? You want to kill these people and take their land for own benefit... Is this not an injustice? Sir, she is a civil rights lawyer. You are looking only this land. But I'm looking the business through this land. Your dream of mining on our land, will never be true, Bhairav Singh! Then, I'll kill you. You will fight for justice for these people.. ..these people are my slaves from decades. Through these documents, you want them to be liberated. Till now, no one able to harm me. And you also could not harm me. You don't know me; I am Bhairav Singh.

I will handle him, I'm the king of this place. You are wrong. Everyone was afraid of Cobra Gang in Hyderabad. They were doing Real Estate business and killed too many people.. ..despite all this they were living freely. I'm getting married to her, Sir. You will marry her, but after spending a night with me. First time, I had seen the attack of Gabbar Singh. That day, we had started to run by seeing him, and still we are running.. So, you are Gabbar Singh! Now I will tell you that, what is fear? Hey Idiot, you are telling me about fear. I am the definition of the fear. Kill him. You have left us? You are a victim of misunderstanding. There are always a mean of every calculus.. ..and always a time for every encounter. You guys made so many mistakes, I cannot forgive you. But who will kill all, I will let him go. Who will? you guys decide it. What happened? I am that one, please. Arrest me, that's all. There is no arrest word in my dictionary. But encounter word! Of course. Hey you, Hyderabadi police!

Hello Arshi darling, a very-very happy birthday to you. Do you know, what is your birthday gift from your aunt? He is the King Vighnesh Chandra Verma. He was the king of Kodgiri.

Please, get out of here. You are insulting me, not him. Madam Geeta, I know that, which groom, she wants. Who are you to interfere in our family matters. Don't forget that, who are you? You are here because of the mistake of the king's father. King has given you 10% of the property. But you want all property. That's why you want to implicate to the princess through this marriage. This cannot be possible until this Hari Narayan is alive. Let's go from here with our shares. Ok, will do. What is this? To stop this, I would have to find out a brave groom for the princess. So, he is a police officer. Hello, that is a royal entry for royals like me. Common entry is for common people, come here. What's going on there? Today is princess birthday, she is distributing cloths. She is distributing herself? -Yes. Shekhar sir, please, since childhood, I wanted to see the King and Queen. Let me see once. Please... please... please. What you think, you will request me and I will allow you to see her? Do you want to see her with your evil eyes? Come. So, she is the princess. The arrangement of meals is there. She is little older than me. But she is doing good work. You have watched? -Yes. Your Princess age and your age is same. Just one year younger than me This is none of your business. Man, come on... come on, I say. You distribute, I'm just coming. I had requested you for a brave police officer, who can face Bhairav Singh. You will send this type man, I never thought. This is only starting, slowly-slowly you will see his power. It's my fault... I want to do that, which is not possible. Hey silly, your goggles... -Sorry. -Oh, listen... You cannot save justice, at least save the honor of your uniform. Did he call me for this speech? And he did this through me? Sher Singh...? -Yes, uncle. There is a parcel in the trunk, bring that. Me, uncle? -Yes, you. Control your eyes. -Okay, okay. You go from here. -Oh! What are you doing? I am saying that, go from here. Hey, what are you doing here? That day, you did not tell your name? So now tell me your name. What's your name? My name...? Tell... My name is... What happened? I know, how you will tell? But I will use my brain not the gun. There is a brush in your hand. And no blisters on the hands, so, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? Hey... You are following me. Right... Why you were following me? Turmeric in your hands, means you were.. ..at that place where the clothes were distributed. It means, you work for the princess. Am I right? Don't worry, I'm here. I have done the same things that you are doing. Our lives are very similar. I will make you happy, your life will be full of happiness.. use me.I mean marry me. In return, you just have to take care of me. Let one thing clear before proceeding... you will say I love you, or I have to say.... See, my salary is 30,000. I will spend 18,000 on you, I'm not addicted to cigarettes. I will make you happy. Do not just decide, take your time. Why the wind is singing like this... Where had you gone? I will not tell you, I'm very shying. You can't hide anything from me. Greetings! -Greetings. Who is standing next to your princess? Next to the princess? She is Madhubala. Wow, what a sweet name! She loves me. She loves you means? She was already in my heart, but, the matter has been set now. That means you already know her. First she had fallen on me, then I fall in her love. No, Madhubala is royally loyal, I know. Greetings! -Stupid. -Hello! Hello... He is saying hello... who is he? This is the man who had saved me near the waterfall. Why he is doing like this? He is saying that, your face is like his aunt's face... ...perhaps he would have remembered his aunt. -Oh! Oh my god! What's going on here? Chauhan, give this bouquet to her. Where are the flowers? You're Highness! Will you please go inside? Please, madam. Let's go. Did he hold the hands at the time of falling? He told you? -Why, should not tell? Actually, I wanted that, anybody will not know this, except Arshi and me. You both discus such things? Why we should not discuss this? We belong to the royal family, it will become a big thing. Don't tell anyone, keep this in your heart. That means, you have hidden lots of things. So, what can I do? If I will say, then his job would be in danger. Who do wrong things, should not be punished? What's wrong in this, he has worked like a real man. If you would be there, then could you leave? So sad... I have never got a chance like this. This is not the matter of chance, it's the matter of guts. -Oh ho! -Yes. Have you thought something to avoid this matter? That is only one way to avoid this, keep it in your heart. Oh my God! Take this and keep it. What I have to do with this, Sir? Go and ask to Sardaar. Hey irritated fellow, what were you saying? I have not said anything I have to do something through these woods? just make a police bat. Police bat...? There is nothing special in police bat, It works like a cricket bat. Cricketers hit Sixers and we make Sixers. I Understand, sir. Sir... Sir, please meet us with him. Please say to the minister sir, to come outside. They cannot come, you go. We want to meet with the minister.. ..our children's school is not running properly. I'm saying, get out of here. The teachers are not teaching proper to our children.. Minister Sir is busy inside. If you want, then come, otherwise, I am going. Sir has come, Sir has come. Sir, Greetings Sir! Our children's future is in your hands now. Let's see, what can I do? Hari Narayan Ji! Would you like to some coffee or cold drink? I want the trust. Our future will be bright... ..I want this trust, can you give me? What happened? Again school problem? To this school, the King had donated a palace in his property. You are misusing this Maharaja Education Trust. You know, what is the condition of those schools? The precious things of the palace, to be auctioned... ...give us, we will sell these things. Good thought, brother. You are a minister, shame on you. At least, you should respect your position. Otherwise, you have to pay for this. Sir, what said the minister? Until this police and those ministers will not be improved.. ..till then our lives cannot be improved. Why he always taunts me? Rajmanik what's their problem? These are themselves a problem. When the minister come, they start to ask about their demands. Hey, you people, get out... Get out from here. Come here, dear, what happened? Get out... I want to go school, but my mother stopped me and said.. ..the school is occupied by thieves. You are police, so please arrest those people.

Anybody can not dare to face, this business tycoon Ramesh Talwar. Bengal Tiger... ...my thirteenth prey. My father was hunting in front of me... ...so he was fleeing to save lives. If anyone get the chance, will definitely struggle. If we don't give this opportunity, it would be a confirmed victim. And hunting is my hobby since childhood. My father said, you're Rajput, hunting should be your hobby. You have to grow this empire, just snatch that, which you like. The King of Ratanpur Empire, did not like this. Whatever he had, distributed to the public. And I have evolved my empire, by robbing that people. He did not like that.. ..In front of the whole village, he punished to my father. Now look, his condition... I could not tolerate this humiliation, wanted to kill him. But could not kill...I was kid. I didn't know, how to shoot. And, when he heard the news of his death... ... then father came out of the coma. What advantage? He has become a living corpse. Now they are trying to make money through this palace.. ..want to make this, as a heritage hotel. Before you, two people came here. I had explained, but they didn't understand. ... was killed, now you have come here. Tell me, what should I do? Sir, everyone does the business for life, not to die. They are your enemy, I didn't know that, please leave me, I will go from here. Trust me, sir. Go after having lunch. Gayatri...? I'm going. Work has begun in Sector 8, Sir. -Congratulation!

He is avoiding and he took away our school, We are in a very miserable condition. To live such a life is worthless. Criminal skull should be cracked like these fruits, understand...? Understood, sir. What happened, Sambha? Have you put henna on your hands? I am the senior officer, Sardaar, helping to my juniors. Pratap...? -Which you will speak, that will be right, Sir.

I am the king and belong to Rajput family. I am a police inspector, and born to punish to the criminals. There is no life or death here, without my sign. If the matter is about life and death, then there is no need of your sign. I have no problem, with the name King Bhairav Singh. I have to change the law and orders... ... time should be changed and timing also should be changed. If it will not be changed, then do you, know what will happen? I will change this world. Good bye. Bhairav, the time of the sacrificial worship is running out. Madhu was coming, but I can't see her. Must be somewhere here, everyone gets lost in the crowd. He was looking for whom, she has got? Had never thought, that, the enemy is so gorgeous. Father, if I will play with this flower, so revenge will be great fun. He is doing with hands, -He is mad. Children, this district must be filled by the sound of your drum. Let's go. Bye. Hey...hey. Hey...hey! Oh, my god! Very bad, sir. They were children. At which time they will come again? At 3 O'clock, sir. Will be on time. That is my world. Hope you enjoyed the stay. Thank you. -Thank you. Sir... What happened? Why these trucks are standing here? have to go to the port. What's the problem? Sardaar has blockaded the road. The truck can move up on his body. All of you have no guts? Come with me. Kill him. Hey Sardaar, you would blockade of this Bhairav? For these people...? These villagers, are my slave. You want to be a hero? You have any idea where you stand? This is my kingdom. Here, the sky, the wind, and water all are mine. Everybody understands, that, this land is his property. But they don't know that, after the death will be merged into the land. A fighter has born to kill the devils like you. And it will be happen forever. You think, you are a leader by killing two people. I can build an army just now. What will you do lonely. You are single. You are single... Yes, I'm single, I alone, but enough for you. Only who can achieve his goal, who takes the first step? In this crowd, only one person could be famous. Wherever go, go alone, I will be alone, will always be with these people. Hey Bhairav, I will show you my power, before crossing this border. Will you see? So watch. He has come to destroy these demons... ...he is more powerful. He is like a lion... ...very strong and brave. He has come to protect people... Hail to him...hail to him! Hail to the hero...! Hail to the leader...! Hail to this brave man...! Hail...Hail...Hail! Hail to this saver...! Hail to this public servant...! Hail to this strong man...! Hail...Hail...Hail!

Who is standing... who is powerful... Who is standing with firmly? Who can fight with this brave man... Watch, he is standing like a rock... His arms are like steel... And his skin is like a Lion... Destroys in an instant... Anyone, who garbed by him... He teaches, this lesson everybody... He can also melt a stone... Who is standing... who is standing... in front of death, who is standing...? Who is standing... who is standing... in front of death, who is standing...? Who is standing... who is standing... in front of death, who is standing...? Who is standing... who is standing... Let see, who is standing with firmly...? Hey, do you remember my name? Gabbar Singh... ...Sardaar Gabbar Singh. Stop! How's the situation, now? What happened to him? I was thinking he would be on fire, but he fell in love. Sir, Minister Sir has come with the whole assembly. And home minister, sir, also has come with him to impress you, sir. I have not come here to impress him, I've come to pay their favor. You tell me the name of the place, for his transfer. Let him stay here. By working hard for so many years, I had built up the fear... ...he finished that, in 5 minutes. Now people have the confidence in him. If any person opposes without fear, then he would become a hero for them. It can be dangerous for us. First, we have to kill their trust and after that to Sardaar. Shekhu! -Little back...little back. Are you guys getting personal...? Go to your work otherwise, I will shoot you. He always comes at the wrong time. In the beginning, I didn't understand you. After a long time, I'm looking a man who fought fearlessly. I want to talk to you something important. Sometime ago they all were grain growers... ..Who all tortured and killed by Bhairav.. ..because of his mining business. Uncle! They lost everything and ended up as refugees. There are many who are living like refugees. On behalf of the trust of our king, we are helping as much as possible. Oh Yes! You were trying to say something. The only desire of all these people is... At one time it was the palace, Here, there was much ado. And now it has become like this. Whatever Raja Saheb retained with great love... ...Those precious things we have to sell.. ..Somehow we keep alive our desires. With great sorrow.. ..queen has taken a decision to convert this palace to heritage hotel For which the Talwar groups had come here. But Bhairav Singh threatened to kill him, So they moved back in fear. We have public strength, but they don't have courage. You will be, their strength. Where my needs, I arrive myself. But here you have called me. I will surely be here... ... where I can go. In life you don't afraid. To the brave man... You are ignoring me by wearing glasses. Listen to me... Excuse me! -Yes sir. Talwar sir, knows, that, we have come here? I told him, sir. Hello! Talwar group here... I'm very sorry. We should not call you to come here. Let's go. Why? What happened? I thought that, we will explain him together, but he doesn't want to meet. You wait here, I'm going to meet him. What game is it, sir? -This is the game of marbles for rich people. Sorry, guys. -Good shot, sir. That's good. Getting better. First time, I'll see, someone playing golf in the uniform. Sorry, I have not come here to play, I have to talk to you. So, tell. -Mr. Hari Narayan has come to meet you. I have said, I'm not interested, He doesn't understand. I don't want to do any risky business. If it would be risky, I would not run away like you, but face it. You have nothing to lose, that's why you are talking like this. Sorry, sir. There is also a risk of death, in the game of entertainment. I'm not saying that, there is no risk. But you must face it. You have built this business, through 5000 monthly income... ...have you done it without any risk? Now Royal family has come to you, to discuss about the public's problem. He is giving his place for your business. So, this is your duty too. By the way, in your language this is a Corporate Social Responsibility. ... understand this like the same. Mr. Talwar, if the matter is about the goodness of the people.. ..so, should decide from the heart. I have protected them, will protect you too. It's Sardaar's promise, I will protect you, by giving my life. You have come, without confirmation. -Just wait for 2 minutes, he will reply. Listen! See you on Monday morning. He is just like the hot sword of the furnace... ... touched my heart. It was my fault, I lied to you. If you then angry with me say something. I cannot afford, your silence. Will you not forgive me? What I say? I was very careful... ... I'm angry with my carelessness. After knowing about you, it seems... ... your life will be worse with me. According to your status, it would be fine for you to marry a prince. Since you came into my life... ... confidence and the hope of living awake again in my heart. I don't want this palace, this honor. I want only you. Arshi, I do not know, how to tell you? I never had such a situation like this, and neither will be. I respect you. And for that respect, we have to stop. I love you and you are talking to go away. I don't want anything, I want you, only you. Please accept me, Sardaar. If you truly love me, so don't let go this love. She talks like angels. She hurt from eyes. The day goes and night comes when she opens her hairs. Her moves like a river, and looks like branch of buds. Your street's sand looks like colours. I'm yours...only yours. What magic you have done. I have come to you, no control on myself. Why you are gleaning your dreams from the threads of hope... Why you are counting the stars at day. I'm blushing little from your talks, but more from your eyes. She talks like angels... She hurt from eyes... The day goes and night comes when she opens her hairs. Her moves like a river, and looks like branch of buds. Your street's sand looks like colours. My heart is like a book... ...you are like a rose, kept in this book. Where is the rose, that is my answer. My dream is only that... ...this dream is impatient. Tell me, you are my darling and I'm your lover. I should not talk to you about which but, I have done this. Don't know, how I fallen love with you. The pair has become. She talks like angels. She hurt from eyes. The day goes and night comes when she opens her hairs. What gift, I give you... Tell me something... How you will take care my heart, which I have given to you. After making yours... ...you would take me... If you do not love me, I will not let you go. You would love on terms, is not fair. There is love in these terms, it's not a compliment. Don't give me so much happiness... She talks like angels... hurts from eyes. The day goes and night comes, when she opens her hairs. Sir, Ramesh Talwar has been convinced by Gabbar Singh. He was too afraid to enter the city. But, Gabbar Singh took responsibility for her safety, so he is coming. Father, after defeat should be afraid. Look, the poor fellow elephant has died.

If you will stop him to come here, then you will have to go out. Sardaar, you are trying to take advantage with my weakness. I have made this Rajput honor.

This is the Akashvani's vividhbharti channel of Ratanpur. And now you will listen Chitrahaar.. ..Gabbar Singh himself is the presenter of this program. Are you fine, sir? Let's start. The good people feel... ...the pain of others. Those are called gentleman... ... who understand the pain of others? Have you seen, inspector sir.. ..the horses of the Ratanpur are very famous. We make million dollar within a few days through this business. Hey fool, this is not the stable of the horses.. ..This is Rajput's horse show. All Rajput's of the country meet here on this day, this is our tradition. What they will do after the meeting? They talk about the winning of past wars. After that, they talk about their broken heart. Oh! And they also talk about hunting. Sometimes monkeys and sometimes lions. I am going, sir. Here this ass is shouting than the horses. I hate you.

My son does business in the country, even richer than them. Hello, Mr. Hari Narayan.. I have come into this gathering program.. ..so give me little attention too. I thought, after this defeat, we will never come here. Even after such an insult... Mr. Hari Narayan you are on my target. Your people and that Sardaar... ... any chance I get, will hunt you guys. First go and control to your uncontrollable horse. Raja Saheb... It will become a case of animal cruelty. Which charges on you, that are not sufficient for you? Do you belong to our phratry? If you want that, my Arshi will get married to the man.. ..who would control the horse, so... ... there are many boys in our community, I can call them? Will say no to them. Don't know, when this Hari Narayan will die, so we will get our share. King Bhairav Singh, uncontrolled animal.. ..does not come under control by show of strength. We can control them, through love and patience. Would be good, if you would be a Rajput. Mr. Hari Narayan, nowadays, we share the blood.. ..so our blood has been mixed. Who think to win, that would not be a king, a winner, will be a king. You guys have seen, which I saw...? I have also seen, that you have not seen. I had doubts on them, but now, I am sure.

Being illegitimate child... ... they treat you as an outsider. If will get married, then we will give you your shares. Everyone will be happy. We accept it. But without Hari Narayan's permission...? Don't worry, he is nothing in front of me. Your Hari Narayan is like our Appa Ji. Go, and talk about this matter, rest, we will handle. Geeta Devi...! You are the daughter of the king... ... so, I respect you. The person, who wants to ruin our lineage.. ..you have come for his propasal. You do not deserve respect. Sir, the princess is roaming with that inspector... ... this is the matter of honor? Princess is in affair with Gabbar Singh, since long time. All are talking about this, next generations do not do like this... ...so, older people have decided something.. ..further, he will explain you. Explain to him... This is happening, without your knowledge? Hari Narayan, if you will break the clan's limit.. ..then it will not be good for you. That would not be, Whatever, she has done, Bhairav Singh would accept her. Mr. Bhairav Singh, wants to marry with the princess. Hey...if you would say this again, then... You will kill to how many people? All know about this. You're the commander, so, you must have to know, where is she? Everybody knows in this palace, except sir. Arshi! We, love to each other, we were thinking, how to tell you? It's good, you didn't tell me. For me, King's reputation is more important than your will. The organization shall be destroyed because of you, that's not fair. For you I can give my life, and this is my responsibility. Your husband should be what type, I know it very well. Who is he? After all, he is our serving soldier. Nobody knows, where he has borne. Derives from the dust, will get into the dust. Don't know, he belongs to a higher caste or lower caste? Catch him. Mr. Hari Narayan, if you will talk about caste discrimination.. ..then, I will not sit silent. When you were in trouble, that time did not remember? When I was falling love with her.. ..At the time, I did not know that she is the princess. After knowing that, I had tried to go away from her. That was not acceptable to my destiny. If someone comes in the way of my duty, then, would not sit silent. If the matter would be of my love, then think, what I'll do? I will kill him. Please have it. How is the tea? Like the tea. How's Arshi? I'm looking first time, you are sad. I like it. Little by little, you will understand... ... That's me who is writing your destiny. First inform then attack is my politics. You speak to me loudly, what is your status? You are watching dreams of the princess... For me, killing you is like putting sugar cube in tea. Listen Dhannu, Whenever you talked about killing.. ..you know, why did I refuse? Because he is not like others. He is born from the minds of people. Shall not kill him at once. Killing him slowly, will be fun. Your last run has been started. Sardaar, in next 72 hours... ...where you have defeated me.. ..if I will not defeat you in the same place.. ..then my name is not Bhairav Singh. Go... Hey Bhairav, Arshi is mine and Ratanpur is also mine. And if you looked at them, I will scrape your eyes. Ha.... 72 hours. Let's watch. So much money and gold, have come from where? When the ACP sir raid on my home, then in fear I told everything. Told everything in fear? what you have told? Sorry Sir, I couldn't able to maintain your trust. I had brought to the sir in this city, and since then we became friends. Sir used to take bribes from thieves in the forest. And also from truck owner without license. No one knows. 2-3 times he send me to bring. What are you saying...? Control yourself. Today violent event have been seen in Ratanpur. When we asked to the people, they told that these were laborers. As you are looking, the investigation is going on. Queen! Have you heard about what's coming on TV? As you can see at the moment, all the people are shouting.. ..slogans against the Sardaar. -Go Go inside and shout slogans. Hey! Where it came from, what came, how many times I tell you? Sardaar! Sardaar! you can't be silent. You will have to answer to the public. He did not answer any of the questions. Here we received only 1000 Rupees, write that. Rajmanik! The law is my manor. This is the leader, who understood.. ..his rights on government money and was doing riotously. His name is Gabbar Singh, but by profession, he is a police officer. Law and order is not in his jurisdiction. Take a bribe, give bribe otherwise sow to the path of death. That was the theory of a Sardar. Every day he came to our house and threatened my husband.. ..and used to send him outside. I prayed in front of him, but he didn't agree. Always by threatening to implicate me in case, he used me. Inspector Sardaar has brought to D.G.P. office. What do you think the whole country is in your jurisdiction. The inquiry has been completed today and tomorrow we will get answers. Hey! In 72 hours, if 45 hours passed, then how many remains? Only 24 hours. All the allegations have been found solid evidence. So you are dismissed from service.. ..and for your judicial custody the law has commanded. Considering all your services.. ..you have given time till Monday to surrender willingly It seems that the sun is going down. But the truth is that we are going to the dark side. Life is same like this. Some questions in my mind which only you can answer. Because I have no one else. My Sardaar has made a big mistake. Helped me and loved me, both are mistakes. He is not one of us, yet we can take help. But can't love him. Where are you going? Going to meet that Sardar? Soon he will be behind bars. You can go to give him food. For the time being, we have many things to decide. Talwar? My regards to your conditioning and ethics. Gita Devi also has the shares in your property. Then, without her signature how you have allowed me to do business? What you want to say? Look! This is court notice, this is bank notice. And this, shareholders petitions for me. And in clear word, she went to court and court granted stay. Whatever problem you have, resolve it internally. Why you are involving me in this? Money which I paid, either you have used.. ..in trust foundation or paid loans, I don't care. In single settlement, if I am not.. ..receiving my cash, then I will go to court. This court fight, reached to family elders. And then reached for me, then I came here to help you. I have sympathized for you. How suddenly my Gita Devi remember court, I know very well. As a commander, number of murders I have done.. ..Your age is not that much Bhairav Singh. Get out from here. Commander! in your army only these two are left. Only these two. Marry in front of the commander, this is also a heartfelt desire of Arshi. Nothing will happen to you. Sit. Arshi!!! Oh! Hold it. Sit.. Sit... Sit... Now, I'll tell you about your future. Like these both, everyone will die.. ..and with that Sardar will spend life in jail. The palace has been already on the court case.. ..and one above you are a girl You don't know the outer world. You will come on the road, If you will think of suicide... ... then it will be an insult of your father. People will think that outsider used and left. That's why in shame she had given life. Although, I can give you a better option. Marry me. Gayatri? Giving presage with my wife hands. If you will say yes for this marriage, then we both will be happy. And if you will say no, then only I be happy. Rest, is your decision. Take this presage Madhu, I agree to this marriage. Take the plate! Take it Sir... Show that. Mr. S.I., Old S.I. Our Bhairav Saheb's second marriage. Same, with queen Arshi. Have sweets. Let's go. Tomorrow Arshi is getting married. I know. This is all because of me. I Was living so far in the ego, received from ancestors. Everyone follow my world, I think it was foolishness. To whom the princess Arshi loves, I didn't able to accept. And now, the one who killed her father mother and tortured people... ...with that person I am sending her as his second wife. Now in front of you, a weak commander is standing. I had lost sardar. You are not one of us, you are below to us.. ..by saying this in my ego, I have hurt you a lot. But, now I am saying, Kings do not take birth in the dynasty.. ..but take birth in between public. Not the one who exploits, But the one who protect is the king Save to Arshi, Sardaar. A commander is begging in front of you. For God's sake, do not bend your head, it does not suit you. Please! Leave Arshi along with Bhairav Singh on me. I will take care of all. You are still here, come we have to go. Come! Why you are standing with such sadness. I can't leave by quitting job. -What you said? Job is my identity - you have told me once.. ..so I can't go by leaving that identity. See! what he is talking? It's difficult to get bail and you are talking about getting job back. Do I touch his feet. Don't need that. -What? Please arrange a meeting with Bhairav Singh. What will you do to meet him? I will tell him, sorry and ask to return my job. What if won't agree, so? I will humbly request him. What if he would abuses you. -Will hear. If he beats you, then? -Will tolerate. What if he put the knife inside you? Will do that, but for God's sake! Will you arrange a 5 minute meeting? Are you ready to do all this? Yes Master. Not only to keep head up, but we should also know to keep it down. Wah! You have learned to talk. See there, they are waiting to kill you once you cross that railway gate. And you are talking to take me directly to Yamaraj? Are you mad? When I thunder! I cross all the limits of madness. Still you trust on him. If I kill him easily... ...there is no fun in that, father. The fun is in the torturing victim. Hey! Leave him. Come. Greetings. -Greetings. Sir, please forgive him this time. He came so let him say. Sir, I understood wrong by seeing weapon in god's hand. You are older, please forgive me considering me as a child. By unknowingly, I said so many things to you and Raja Saheb. In the joy of this wedding, please forgive me. If you would give back star on my uniform and lion on the cap.. ..then I would very much favor. Sorry, won't look good on your face. Expressions are not in sync. My face is like that Sir, if say seriously, still no one believe. But I am saying from my heart, I am sorry. This is the matter. Do you dance? No Sir, that just like... Why are you feeling shame? want to star on uniform and lion and cap... ...then do this. -I am in this police uniform... You are in police uniform then what? Rock this party.
