Harder~ Harder~ In this way, he can be liable for his young bride. Ah~ As we do it like this, he can get first son. People hit me like that once I was married, Thank you for coming, elderly~ Dad, Enjoy having a lot of delicious food on today. Ah... Okay... Go there. Hey, Detective Lee. When are you gonna get married? I do not know. Why don't you come with your wife, Chief? His mother-in-law has a cataract surgery on today. You seem to know my family's affair more than I do. No... No... dad. Come in with me. Keep going... Keep moving... Going. Going... It's an adultery. I bet my six-sense is right. You know... That's useless if An adultery don't have the scene of fuck... Sometime, I used to go sleep with graping my husband's peanut. You mean... this? The asshole really hates to take a shower. So he always reeks aloud of salty. If it is Humid, the odor can be... But, one day he begins to come home lately without any reasons. So I grabbed it as I did. But he was so clean. It meant that he just took a shower. Instead of, it smelled like a golden-color soap. It is a golden-color cheap soap every motel? Not enough... not enough. Detective Cho, please... Could you put a tail on him? I'm just a sincere detective from the government. - These boobs are yours? - Hey! Cho! There is a case! Hurry up! I'm ashamed. Damn it! Why does he cut at this point. Should we go on the day-off? The section of identification? I've got it... asshole... - Get the camera... - Yes, sir! Cho! You just stay there! Don't come here! What! Veteran detective who's gonna investigate without me. Hey. Cho, Who is veteran? - Just stay here. - Ah... What a bad breath! What on earth did you eat? - Come in, sir? - Where is it? Over there... You... know... I was... athlete? He is an incorrigible... If I drink the rice-wine again, I'll be a son of bitch. It was revealed by swept soil from last night's rain. All you guys... Investigate... Don't be such an ass... As a result of Autopsy on the body, I presume that he was buried after suffocation on September 7th around 22:00 when was 18 hour ago from the dead was discovered. Judging from fact that nothing is discovered something like suspect's blood from his nail. He didn't resist the suspect at the time of murder. Maybe it means that he and suspect knew very well each other. Or a kidnapper tried to remove evidence when he was sleep. As I said, it might be someone like a kidnapper. Hey. Detective Moon! First of all, we have to find out the dead's identification and compare his identification with other missing children all over the country, and... We have to know that he got dental remedy being called 'SS Crown'... And... 'SS Crown' is... Take a look in this picture his teeth are almost white-colored. Here... only two teeth are pure white... very pure... Anyway... Cloths he wore are new one. They had been about two days. This point must keep in mind. Please. If we solve this case, it is sure that you will be promoted soon. A reason for Our friendly society being is for your promotion... you know? What a wonderful Makgeolli (rice-wine)! Did you remember us to report dog-thief last year? Don't worry... We will take our town upon here. Do me a favor... O. K I've got it... Detective Cho! Go for it! He makes us get tired again. Bastards! Shit! Are we his employees? He is just called a Detective but he can do nothing. That's why he isn't promoted yet... He was involved in an adultery case years ago. So he was demoted at that time. But we have to do it. Otherwise he must bother us with excuses he will make. We just hang around for a while and give some money to him... No way, he's a sex maniac. We just introduce a hot boobs to him. Just go and ask him what's going on. What happen with this car? Is It crashed over? The day before yesterday a guy crashed into this car and drove away. Hit and Run? I think that he was drunk. His car came down from the Soosang Art Hall and crashed straightly. And he just got away. Why didn't you capture him even though you served in the marine corps. What time was it? About 22:30? That day. Did you see the driver? Yeah... he is young man alone in the car and he looked like a college student. What was the car number? I saw it certainly. I was really the marine. So I reported right away. In Life and Athletic Department. Professor Kim Ok-Ja, What? Im Ok-Ja. There... Go to the Chun Cheon. I've got it. Ok... Thanks... Chun Cheon... O. K! One, Two, Three. So hot... I was too busy in the beginning of this semester so I couldn't report. Where did you lose your car? At the parking lot in the university. Before coming here. We checked that already from the parking office. The day to lose your car, you left to drive your car. The car gets involved in a case of murder. Lee! Take her to the Police Office. I hate them telling a lie. The professor do that, too. We don't suppose to let the university know. Come here... Wait. I have an idea who did it. Sedong! I don't know which credit card company is. I give up him already. You make him a delinquent borrower forever or ostracized from society, I don't care! After he served army, I expect that... I Hey! We are just detectives... Sir... in fact, we are going to find a vicious moneylender. Then we heard that he ran after Sedong. To capture someone who doesn't pay and hide is a piece of cake for them. If he capture, he would extract anything from them instead of their debt. Extract? Sedong is penniless. Eyes, Liver, Kidney, even bone marrow... At this time, maybe he is able to dissect them perfectly. And anything that he doesn't need is buried by him in a hill. Totally... So we want to protect Sedong first and arrest the moneylender. Buried without eyes... Oh... Terrible... Maybe Sedong stay in Jechon City. His best friend, Chul-ho works in the Jechon Hotel. - Jechon. - Jechon Hotel... Got it! Hi, sweetie! Why? I'm not stranger. I'm sure... Not here, let's come to my car? Don't do that! Don't do that... I like you what you are saying. Your pronunciation is so tender. Pretty... Maybe, I'll buy Louis Vuitton every girls like, for you? Fuck you... Give me a scoop of this... Asshole~ Hey, lee! What are you doing here? - Shut up! - Get away... On stakeout? Shut up... Asshole... Get out... Hey. Taewon! Do you think that I wear this hat for showing off? For a stakeout we have to disguise prettily. And hide oneself. If we don't do this, we would be discovered. Put on your hat you have! Not smarten! O. K... Got it... Just ask me if you have any question If you have any question. - Put on strongly... - Hi, Mr. Cho! Yeah, Hi! Do you remember Cho Kyoung-Soo in my class? I see. I heard that he always have a gang fight. Mom... This is his father... Bring me a plate of Teokbbokki... Pretty... How old are you, kid? Six years old... Six? Do you like to play cartoon card? No, I don't... - I want to give a good card to you. - Hello... I'm sorry to mistake him for other person. I'm O.K. Are you a policeman? Son of a bitch! Can I call for my lawyer? Give me a phone! How dare young boy~ I will see Lee's hidden skill after a long time because of you. Bloody nose... Up... Up... Do it like this... Why do you run away alone... and fall down... and hurt? Son of a bitch! Sit down! Sit upright... Sedong. I really hate someone to lie and be rude... Me too... Let's try again... Yes, sir! Do you like children? Yes. Do you know him? No. Really? Well, What did you do around the Soo-Sang Art Hall with your stealing car the day? You didn't only drive? Right? - You don't like to answer... Right? - I went out with girls... Sedong... Here is a lot of tissues. If you try any of your pretty tricks, I will stay here with you all night long. I'm serious. I took a picture with them. And I got the cell phone number. They were three. I tried to hock them up because of someone like seoul girls. I met them at kudzu-juice stand for taking a break. Check this out, please! What the fuck... what did you do to them? I do nothing. I swear... Why did you run away from us? Hey. Cho... these are found in his car. Don't say close to me! Son of bitch! Motherfucker. See it... Bastard! What is that? He suddenly showed it to me and asked of giving money. Otherwise, he threatened me to send this picture to the president's office and my husband. If I make no bones about it, would you let it slide? I mind the university know and if my husband knows it, It's up to you, Cho... Most doctor remember their surgery but I don't remember that. This cloths is for 8 year old boy. Did you sell something like this? No, I didn't. More... Take it down... Right... Stop... No... It's not... Does it make sense? We can not find the victim's identity yet. Chollado, Choongchungdo, kyungSangdo, do search for evidences all over the country! Do it by yourself if you want to. You tell off us for investigating everyday. We all can not be involved in this case, so I'll make a task force for this case. Except for this case, tell me about each team involving in case. First team, Recently Buddha statue in Kyoungmoon Temple was stolen. How do only one team cover all over the country? It means this case is almost finished. Second Team. Yes. Sir. We know that medicine made in china spread into International Oriental Medicine Bio EXPO. So, now we are investigating this case. And This EXPO is important in the Jechon City. Additionally, it is that special event can introduce national brand called Republic of Korea all over the world. Especially, we are in charge of this event... Stop it. Third team... Yes sir... We are... Detective Cho! Me? Yes... we are investigating about an adultery case. There is a woman who habitually grab her husband's dick for her sleep. She dance the jitterbug well and softly. And her husband didn't like to take a shower. One day, when he comes home lately, There is salty smell... he smelled like soap in terms of what I said much more soap smell... It is a golden cheapish soap. We can always find it every cheap motel. This dead's case... You, third team, take on. I agree with you, sir. I try to do my best. Shit! Why me? What? Don't tell me you didn't know what everybody knows it... All you guys hatched a plot. Taking this case is all because of me? Why not? Why did you pick me up? If you explain on the ball, it would be alright. I was tired for staying all night. You know... Don't you know that the section chief always wash a shower with the golden-color soap. You told the truth to her face. So you stand out. Does she really use it? You really stand out more than any other people. You are fucking tall. Everybody can find you 50 meters ahead. So every suspects get away. You talk about it again? Doctor Kim of NSI told me that your hair is not born in our country. I am... You... Where do your eyes focus on? Cho... Don't say that, please... When you grow up, did you transplant a cheap eyeball? What on earth did you have once you grow up? Fuck... Too disgusting... If you want to say something, write it down. On paper. Do not say anything! I go to the hospital. What's up? Kyoung-Soo? Maybe he is in a school. Why don't you study? Why do I come to the police office everyday? Hi, detective Cho... What a wonderful! Yes it is... Show me your cigarette. Are you a patriot? You have a domestic cigarette. Teacher... I'm really sorry. Today, I heard that Kyoung-Soo hit someone with a chainsaw. Do you know why he did it? It means that he is the top of fighter in the school. I apologize. Do you like something like a chainsaw? If you like it, open up your own hardware store. Close to me... Come here. I want to talk with you, son. I really want it. You. Cho Kyoung-Soo! Hey. Stop! Yeah... Bastard... You... Cho! Is he a suspect? Do you want me to catch him? No thanks... Give me a word... My agencies spread out over the town. It is so easy to catch him. No! Get out of my face and catch a ghost! Why do you annoy me? I can catch him for you if you want to. Yes. We presume that the victim is As you see the picture, he took a "SS Crown" remedy. We must have to prevent from doing something horrible to children. Detective Cho, except for the victim's picture and "SS Crown" picture. Is there anything else what we have to know for his identification? This case... is... Where am I looking at? Cut! I told you that you have to see here now. Here. See here. Your nose would be showed only if you don't see the camera. Your nose... Well, Q! Q! Q! Ci... citizen... Cut! Stop it. Why don't you say "Citizen are..."? Can you catch a suspect with sturring! Stop it... I'm accustomed to appear on T.V. Did you see me? As you know, I have well-defined features and an exotic appearance. Am... You look like living a fence in Egypt. What did you say? No. Not you... Mrs. Kim, Karaoke owner, also watched me on TV? Maybe she was stuck on me again. Calm down! It is too noisy... I'm going to go to Wonju city for my job. I'll give you a call later. I've got it. It is nothing to brag about. Is it wrong to be handsome? Sorry, then I... I watched on the program by chance, I am sure that I had his teeth treated. Maybe, I think, it was 2 years ago. Get me medical cards of children who had a "SS Crown" remedy from 2005 to last year. I'm sure of him. His name is Moon Sang-Hyun. He took a remedy last year. Thank you Yes, I checked it from the dentist. We are going to visit there directly because his home phone number is changed. It, I'll give you a call as soon as I check it. Don't worry. If we check the victim's identification, we would have finished half the work. I think so. Hey, kids! Don't distract me! Is here Sang-Hyun's house? Yes. Are you close to Sang-Hyun? He is Sang-Hyun. Are you really Moon Sang-Hyun? Yes, I am. Who are you? How do you stand all night to obtain a kid's identity? Fuck off... The boy will be buried temporarily tomorrow. It was already two months ago. That's wrong! Are you kidding me! You know? It takes about three years... Three years! What the Fuck! Three years! It is not a long time. - Have a pee and shake it several time... - Son of bitch... He have to pay for that. I don't know. Damn it. What do I do? I supposed that Mrs. Kim is alone with managing a karaoke. So I just want to be someone to talk with her. Many people around me used to call me an upright person. Although you misunderstand, I am of a mind to dive into the Chungphoong lake because I am involved in this scandal. There is an act of providence. If you need my help, I would help you sincerely. So... Forgive me... Please. So embarrassing... Shit! Is your son a policeman from this police office? My son... Sir... If you tell me his name, I would find him. My... son... Lee's Father! What are you doing here? - My... son - Do you know him? Yes... I'm Changsik... Changsik... He ask of me calling his son, a detective. I have trouble with finding his son because he don't know his son's name. - Does he come here alone? - Yes, sir. - Daddy... - He is my son. What are you doing here? I'm anxious about you don't come home. He takes your inner wear, Lee... Didn't his vietnamese wife come back yet? It is about ten days for her to run away from home after quarrel. It seems to be a long time. They don't communicate each other. Also they each have a different culture. Then their marriage without love for their each need is too difficult. Additionally, her father have Alzheimer's disease and even a stroke. So he have to understand and take care of her more. I'm sure that he has been drinking. Chunphoong cafe have a great time. It's great. His father become a nuisance again. How about your father? My aunt comes and takes him to home. Good. Excuse me. Give him something to eat. Please... Their height are different 10cm more. Also he wore a brace. But, the boy who we find out doesn't. Children like him can't wear it because they don't have permanent teeth in total. You mean his identity was a false entry? Look at this... If he open his eyes, they would be same. Was he an autistic child? Here it is. Jung Myoung-Hwan is the youngest of two boys and a girl of Jung In-Su and Ko Young-Sook. Let me see. They have moved out many time. They moved out less than a month after they lost their boy and reported. You've got it. O.K. Let's do it like this. Kim tries to check the situation when they reported the missing child. And Cho checks whether the missing child and the dead boy are the same or not with legwork around his house. Yes. Sir... Why does he give me a call? Yeah, teacher... Now? I'm going to Seoul for work. Yes, I see. What? Did Kyoung-Soo hit someone again? What did he do again? Mr. Oh... I'm really sorry. It's all my bad we taught them wrongly. I'm so sorry. - Sir, I apologize truly. - Fucking Mr. Cho. How dare do you do it to me? Could he hurt my son like you! - I'm sorry. - I'm really sorry. Why don't you just kill him? You want me to fight? Is there anyone who doesn't get the bribe from me! Huh! Who is there? Sir, Here are children... Come down... please... Fuch up. Kyoung-Soo carries a shovel this time. He is an asshole... I'm afraid of him taking your gun next time. Mr. Cho. At this time... Kyoung-Soo maybe expel from school. I know that you are very busy though. Can you take care of him especially a week? I'll try to save him somehow. I'm depending on you, teacher. I hope that it is. Please... I'm really sorry. I am gonna really cut his hair all. Cho. Where do we go? Seoul. What about Kyung-Soo? I'll take him... This is Jung Myoung-Hwan's hair which he submitted for DNA test when he reported his missing child. It isn't definite... So you don't tell it to his parents. Please. Myoug-Hwan... I think he will be... What's wrong with him? We took a picture when he was sleep. Look at this picture. Is he Myoung-Hwan who lived in the basement of my building, isn't he? I know... the autistic child? Yes, he is. He is just Myoung-Hwan. Although his family was poor, they cost a lot of money for him. He is their nuisance. They devoted themselves to take care of him. - Is he heavy autistic? - Don't even talk about it. At that time I first knew that autism have a symptom like that. The boy was obsessed with unpleasant sound people hate. I broke a plate by mistake once I washed the dishes. Myoung-Hwan listened it and broke all the other plates. I tried to stand him because of his parents but my son's wife was pregnant. After all, I put them out. Excuse me. Do you know Jung In-su? I know them. They rented an upstair of my house. I feel pathetic when I remember them. Do you remember the day when Myoung-Hwan was lost? Of course. The day my neighborhood was confused. I also went around for finding him. Why? How was he lost? Well Myoung-Hwan's father was a taxi driver. He came home afternoon after he worked all night and went to his wife's work place with his son. Then, in a short time. He lost his son. He went around for his son all night long. After all he didn't find his son. Did he lose him after he took his son out? Yes. Wow... Yours? Hey... What are you doing? Get out. What kind of man have a long eyebrow like a woman? Your nose is long... That side is too long... Two and two? Yes. Two cream, two sugar. Especially I will make coffee by "two-two-one" method for you. What is "One"? Two sugar. Two cream, One is my mind. It's pretty obvious, they were extremely poor. At one time he had enough money to live on. He managed a tool wholesale store. But he went bankrupt. Moreover he guaranteed friend's debt. He needed money, but who lend money to him these days? He went here and there for money. After all, he used a private's lone. In fact, the private moneylender was my favorite type. But after I heard about his job, I gave up him. Hey! Are you female? Yes, I am. What's wrong? Son... The moneylender... He is a real trickster. They look like a family if complete strangers see them. I also did it. Myoung-Hwan. Myoung-Hwan. Don't go there. Are you O. K? Where have you been? He took a drive with us. Do you remember that Myoung-Hwan wore a brace? It looks like an wire. No, he didn't. Although he got a mental disorder, his teeth was clean. They didn't afford to have a brace. Hey... Jung. I know someone who make a fortune by his own efforts after the war. - He have a building in Kang-Nam. - Stop it. Myoung-Hee likes him more than... Who told you that I wouldn't pay up? Myoung-Hwan's dad... Stop it... - I told you never say that again! - Get them out... Stop it. Why did he do that? Honey, give me a call later. Got it? I will give a cup of tea for free. Bye... Take it back! Bitch! Tell me why he did it... Relax... I'll let you know. There was an old man who was very rich. He lived alone. The money lender recommended Jung In-Su to put his baby up for adoption in terms of the lone debt. Was it good for her? Mr. Jung didn't want it. Nobody know a money lender's mind. Who knows, an old man wanted Myoung-Hee to be a bond service or whatever she does. Or he want to go sleep with Myuong-Hee every day. As you know, It was used to be a strange stories for long time ago. I heard that they moved out less a month after their kid was lost. Why did they move? So I think a little odd. At least, did they let me had new address. If they try to find their child, I don't understand them. Awesome~ We heard about what he know roughly. Let's go. Are you leaving now? Give me your name card. Who knows? There is something to help. Yes. Their blood type and DNA are different all. Is it right? Really? I have to meet the child's mother. I'll text her address to you. O.K. You have to disguise well. I see. I'll give an evasive answer. - Be careful, sir... - Yeah. Got it. As a result of DNA test with a father's hair, it is not Mr. Jung's biological child. He isn't. So his father could killed him easily. According to the situation, his father is definitely the suspect. I think so. Who is this? - Are you interested in men? - Fuck! I didn't. Fuck you. - Asshole... - What is it? That's him. "One is my mind". In amazement... Hey, the detective like us is a job to live on an appearance. Do you remember ladies on today? They gave more information to me because I'm handsome. Lee, take a shower. I'll do if for you, too. No, thanks! I don't do the massage like woman. So embarrassing! Kyoung-Soo, Come here... Shut your mouth... He takes after me being nice-looking. He is also a good fighter. Yes, I can understand. When I was your age, I was also a good fighter. Do you know my nickname? It's "Hurricane Joe". This name is a cartoon title when I was young. This guy hits enemies extremely. When he make a great shot finally, he used to grab a Eundan case strongly in his pocket. Very strongly. At last, grab it tightly and then big shot. Big shot. Whomever he hit, they kissed the cross all. I did that, too. Yeah, I understand. You guys can fight each other. But you have to fight with naked fists. Never pick up the tools. Understand? Never do that. Keep it in your mind. Yes. I mean you don't fight. Yeah. She is her... A special department for missing people was organized under Human Rights commission lately. We are going to arrange priory database again. What do I do? For DNA test, let me have you hair, first. Wait a minute. My hair is too dirty. I check for arranging data. Is Myoung-Hwan your biological son born with Jung In-Su? Right? Yes. The day Myoung-Hwan being lost, I heard you found out him till When I was lost for a while for long time ago, I found him under an elevated railroad. He was particularly interested in noise like running subway. So I went around an elevated railroad in Seoul. I had been everywhere. To be sensitive of noise, is it a kind of autism symptom? Yes, It is. All his mistakes begin from his parents. If I take him to good hospital regularly, he would be treated. But as you see, we are poor. He took it with writing down... It remains because we arranged and sent it to the evaluation organization. Why did they drop? The national facilities focus on welfare recipients. So his neighborhood have joint signatures and send it to them but It wasn't done. Joint signature? Yes they were. Their neighborhood evaluated them favorably. Although they were poor, they lived life to the full. The boy's mother delivered newspaper till dawn. After that, she cleaned a street clearly around her house. Myoung-Hwan used to express himself the way of shouting loudly. Especially, when he found his doll he wanted, we all used to have a rough time from him. Do you know where Myoung-Hwan's doll is? Myoung-Hwan, play well with Byuli. I will have been a school. - You get a clay? - Yes. You got a melodion? Get a hold of yourself. Today is your turn? Today I have to participate in pre-round of the children's song competition in school. I told you that you don't participate in. After school, come and pick him up. Okay? Say hello... Bye. Mom. I can pick him up, I can change my turn to clean and run faster. So I'll be there on time. Watch out... son... Wow... so cool! Are you sure? - Have some. - Here comes the King! Hyun sung~ Shoot into the target! You and me are the same team. Stop it! It's up to me... Don't do that. Do it my way. In fact that I'm the Phiccachoo... Do you want to receive my thunderbolt kick? Don't bother him! Stop it! Sir, have myoung-Hwan been here? What? You picked him. Myoung-Chul... What happened? Myoung-Hwan disappeared. I played with him and... Where? In front of the stationary store Excuse me. Did you see an young boy like this? He puts on suspenders with a doll. No. Mom! There is Myoung-Hwan. Myoung-Hwan... Are you alright? Why are you here? Myoung-Hwan's mother... Fuck up! Clean the crap out... You've got fired if you take him here again. Hi! Hi, Myoung-Hee Here I am... Your face is more beautiful. Myoung-Hwan is good at painting. In my table~ inside of a drawer~ in my family picture~ I love... Myoung-Hwan! Kids! Are you alright? Do you hurt your leg? I'm O.K. I feel no pain. I'm sorry, sir. Because of my brother... Be careful around the street. Let's go, Myoung-hWan... Myoung-Hwan, Be careful around the street... Let's Go... Do you find anything else? Not yet. Hello, Doctor Kim. Hi! Mr. Lee, you are higher and higher Whenever I see. It's his mother's hair. A hair which his father submitted was a woman's hair. What? It means that he submitted it on purpose. It's almost done with it. No. No. We can't arrest him without a direct evidence. First of all, we can arrest him without a warrant. Capture him and beat him up. After that, it will be done. That's it. Hey young boy. Why are you too old style? Shit! How does he kill the son even though his son is disable? Does it make sense! Fuck! I can understand him. My father is... Hey... stop... He can't walk alone. Also he wanders to go to stool by himself. Me and my bro don't afford to take my father to a good sanatorium If there is anyone who take care of him sincerely, the situation would be better. As I see my father, he is such nuisance to us... I think. For himself... he would rather die in a hurry. Are you nut! Sometimes that's what crossed my mind. What is the government doing now? So I fuck up! All that I earn cost the wrong way. It stinks. Son, What's wrong with this washing machine? This is out of order. What? Dad. Is his father a criminal? Well, It will be. I want his father not to be a criminal. I think so. Father never do that whatever may happen. Anyway, you look dirt and unkempt, what happen with you, super star for middle-school boys in Jechon. Well... You, Mr. Cho Chnag-Sik, an idol and tough guy of ladies in Jechon are the same with me. Do you buy a Nintendo Wii? Yes. In my home we are going to play game all together now. - Your home? - Yeah. Who come there? Kyoung-Suk and Tak-Su. Do you come over? Can I go there with my brother? What? Your brother? Come alone. Do you think that he's okay with listening video game sound? And you know that my mom hates your bro. Isn't he? Come or not? Hurry... O.K. I will be there. Hurry. Here. Myoung-Hwan stay here for a while. I'll have been there for 30 minutes. Myoung-Hee. Take it... No, thanks. Or this? No... Daddy. Yeah. Does your bro take care of Myoung-Hwan? - Yes. - Hello. Here is Hyun-Seung. What is this? Chocolate. Everyday you buy something for Myoung-Hwan. Here. This is mine? Of course. You are the best, Myoung-Hee. You are pretty. Dad. He is the one who bothered Myoung-Hwan. Hyun-Seung is very kind. Am I Kind? Would you like it? Dad, Let's go! Myoung-Hee, Call 911! A fire in my house. Here is Sanggyedong 121-5. You found the suspect, right? What the fuck is going on, Huh! Why can't you arrest the suspect! Are you gonna fuck me up with! - Come over! Right now! - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Shit... Go on... Do you need for moving out? How could you do that for? Do you remember what I said? Adoption for Myoung-Hee. My offer is still valid. Don't say that again. There is not a strange place as you think. Are you strange to me? I think of Myoung-Hee as my nephew. But do I send her to the strange? I'm disappointed with you. Where have you been? I check all store and gas station and restaurant within 4 kilometers from center of the Soosang Art Hall. But nobody saw Jung In-Su the day. Just go for it directly with an excuse you can make. Hello. Motherfucker... Is your boyfriend you liked? Yeah. Thanks to. What the hell are you! What? Notice? Really? Who send it? Police? Check the date and the location for the violation. I will be there as soon as possible... So keep it well... What is that? After Jung In-Su moved out, a notice came to Ko Kuem-Suk, sister-in-law, from the police. He just opened it up because he didn't know their new address. It was a notice of violation fine that her car got pinched by speed camera. As I check the date and the place, she went out from the Chungbu highway to the Olympic road around 01:08 A.M. Next day when Myung-Hwan was lost. Hold on... The estimated time of his death is about 10 PM... What about 01:08 A. M? About three hours. It was enough time to get Seoul back from the place where the boy was killed. Sister-in-law, Ko Keum-Suk become a suspect? Can you check that her car was taken pictures more at that time in the highways? I've got it. Hang up. This is Ko Kuem-Suk's name card. She is a nurse. Is it good for you? Yes... Yes You ingrate! My car? My sister's husband took it. He needed it to find Myoung-Hwan. But if... Are you a policeman? No, we aren't. We are the staffs from the department for missing people under the National Commission on Human Rights. He is the boy who ran away from home. We are going to take him we found. Yeah... He's right... Well, As three months already go by, can you find Myoung-Hwan? Try to do our best. In fact, if I say it like this, I would be punished by Heaven. But I think that he had better die comfortably anywhere for himself. It's all because of the money-lender. In the end, Myoung-Hwan's autism is his fault. As you know, there is no way. How much do you borrow till now? An interest increases more and more. Don't you think that you should do something? I recommend the special way for you First of all, Having a baby And as soon as you give a birth, you buy an expensive accident insurance about. Four or five. This money is enough to pay the premium for several months. I'll give you money for next month, too. Of course, I'll lend you. But I will never get the any interest about this money. Doesn't a money lender take a interest? Who believe that? But I promise. I'll never take it. Why? You are very pathetic. So I feel as if it could happen to me. Don't think too much. It's very simple. After you give a birth about 100 days. You drive out with your baby. Of course, using a baby seat in the back. You pull over and get off the car to buy some milk. My employees pretend to stop the car behind your car. And they crash properly into your car. Who do horrible thing like this? Don't worry. Among of debtors, there are many people to do something over it for money. Even if the baby is in safety seat without seat belt, he will be shocked with his head hitting. As he is a newborn baby, he will be wrong. Or what if he is not. He would get a serious disorder. It might be called "Hoffmann Method". They use ways of calculating an age of working and average life. You will receive a lot of money for compensation. You can pay off your debts and have a new beginning. It's easy... Huh? By the her situation... she must accept it. Does it make sense to kill a baby? In pregnant, she suffered from fears and under the stress. After all, it affected the baby. And he got a autism later. My sister couldn't do that. So she canceled all contracts. After all, the costs add to their debt. Why didn't you report it to the police? What kind of helpfulness does the police give us? As you know, they are persistent and scary. Is this the office? - What the hell are you? - Bastard! Asshole! Motherfucker! Bitch! Come here! Bastard! Shit! What the hell are you? Get up. Get up! Son of bitch! What the hell are you? I'm "Hurricane Joe". Hey. Clam down. Cho... Son of a bitch! Yeah? I'm sure of Jung In-Su. It was dawn. Yes. I've got it. Good job... Dad... Get some this ointment. Kyoung-Soo. Do you want to live with your mother? Why? I come home lately everyday. And I can't take care of you. She live with her mother but you are alone. Do you know why I and your mom get a divorce? Don't you know? You usually came home lately with drinking. - And you went well with ladies in Jechon. - Well, there is a reason. But There is more important reason. Your mother wished that I read books and study for the life of the police and take a exam for promotion. But as you know, I can't do that well. Do you know my rank? - Corporal... - Yes. I'm a corporal. This is upper to constable. Other policemen become a corporal or upper position over the corporal through the exam between Although I was in the police for 15 years, I'm still a corporal. Although I was demoted because of the scandal, I'm an incapable person. So your mother hated me. If you go around for fighting, you would be an incapable person like me. And you can't married with a pretty girl you like. Are you funny? I think that you want to get married. And... are you gonna be circumcised this winter vacation! I can't live any more. Jung In-Su is coming behind. Let's go into after the kids go to school. - Good morning. - Hi~ Do they like that younger bro, troublemaker is gone? Really? What if. Do they bother us? I will be there. What is that? Mr. Kang, Money lender was arrested by the police. They ask of me testifying. We don't pay off anymore. It's enough money we have paid. Is it a futile act? Excuse me. In fact, we are detectives. Last time we lied to you unwillingly. We have to investigate about your missing child. Come with us. What's the matter? What does my lost son have to do with him. Don't worry. It will be O.K. You... are you? No, It's not what you think. It was the picture when he was discovered. I was on the way to my wife's workplace, While I got a call from my company, I didn't pay attention to Myoung-Hwan. I heard that you found him till dawn next day. Where had you been? At first, I tried to look for him around where he lost. I got an idea that he might go to my wife. So I went there. I heard that she finished her work, already and went home. I gave a call to her. She told me that she came home almost. I told her his lost. I thought it would be serious. I reminded old houses which we lived ever. I borrowed her car in the hospital where Sister-in-law worked. And I visited those houses one after another. All night long? As I thought, I visited the same place repeatedly. Anyway, I did it. I don't remember exactly. At that time I was much embarrassed. Why didn't you report immediately to police station? I thought that my wife would report it. When I visited the center of missing child, they recommend me to report it first. Do you remember this? According to the entry, you put his height 10cm more and his wearing brace. The truth is different, isn't it? Did you write it down directly? Why did you lie? Who was the hair which you submitted as a DNA sample? Why did you submit others? And... Did you think that he could come home again? Why did you move out less a month? You didn't remain your address! All you did are for trying to conceal killing your son. It's all my sins. Firstly, I tried to find my son madly. What if my pathetic son lose a way and meet with an accident? But then suddenly how about if he was disappeared like this? No, I had to find for my kids left. No, he had better be gone for my family. Many thoughts made me confused... As I thought like that, I ran blindly in the Seoul city. I ran along the street. More and more I got a frightening thought. He would rather die for himself. If he lives his life miserably like that, he had better die. I'm a bastard... Frankly speaking, I hoped that he wouldn't come home wherever he died. I'll try to get his confession within 48 hours. Yes... He look naive but he is as slippery as an eel. He seems to make preparation well. Prosecutor told me that it is difficult to request a warrant because we don't have a direct evidence. Push ahead strongly... I want to transfer to desk duty as soon as possible because of Kyoung-Soo. If it is impossible, I'll have one year's leave of absence. Okay... I want to cut my hair a few day ago. Thank you. From when are you my son's friend? Ah... I'm his high school buddy. I know my son's alumnis all. But I see you, handsome and kind for the first time. I have often met you. I was really close to your son. If you were my son's buddy, you would be embarrassed. My son was famous for... Yeah, he used to be... Nobody picked a fight with me because I was his buddy. So I was comfortable. It was a good thing. It's so admirable of him to be a policeman with settling down. I'm proud of him. Yes, he is. How about your parents going? My mother passed away long time ago. I have just a father. You and my son are the same. Is your father going okay? Not fine. He has a stroke and a Alzheimer's disease. You might have so much concern. Treat your father nicely... No... No... I'm Sorry... I have spoken amiss... As he is good to me like this, how nice he is to his father... No, I wasn't. From now on, I have to be. Sir... Long life to you. Thank you. Do you get your transcripts today? My rank is 29th in my class. Your rank rises up to four steps. I'd like to change. He look namy cell phone, please. How dare you be so brazen! I'll go up proceedingly. Really? O.K. I'll get off early because I transfer to the desk job today. After work, go shopping together. Yes. Give me a call when you get off. I'll be there on time. I've got it. See you there... Chun Se-Dong... Im Ok-Ja... Excuse me. Where is Ko Young-Suk? She quit a few days ago. Why did she do suddenly? I heard that she entered hospital because of her right-leg was paralyzed. Where is Ko Young-Suk? She was here a minute ago. She doesn't do it like this. I heard that her leg was paralyzed. Why did she enter hospital? She is involved in the case which I am investigating. She has a malignant brain tumor. Five months ago, when she came here, her tumor had spread so far. So I couldn't effect a cure. Not let on her family, the patient was enduring by using a pain-killer. Not long ago, her's husband knew it because her leg was paralyzed. So she entered. All we have to do is just to relieve her pain now. It is impossible to recover. For the last few days, she can't recognize people. And she sometimes seems to be imaged things. Mom~ Is is a ladybug, isn't it? Myoung-Hwan, my son... Myoung-Hwan... You scared me. Where is your daddy going? What should I do for Myoung-Hwan if I die? His disease would go worsen and be painful more. Myoung-Hwan... Myoung-Hwan. Let's take a photo. One, two.
