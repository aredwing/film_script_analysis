Neither fate nor society put Francis Mulligan in the house of Gloria Mitchell on the night of the 15th. Neither fate nor society told him to tie her up, shove a gun in her face and steal her belongings. That was his choice. The defense would have you walk in his client's shoes. Well, I have. I'm from Riverdale. It's a craphole. Nobody's saying it's not, but... that's where I'm from. It's not who I am. He is not the victim here. So if you are gonna put yourself in anyone's shoes... put yourself... in Gloria Mitchell's. Thank you. The jury will now adjourn to deliberate a verdict. Nice close. Straight to your top five. - You like that? - Yeah, I did. "Not who I am. " That was very cute. - I gotta go. - Mitch, the jury only just left. Guilty, five years, parole after two. - How do you know that? - One, the judge is soft on the educationally-challenged and nobody got shot. And two? I don't lose. Well, that part's true. - That's why I hate you. - See you tonight. Look up. Look up. Please. - One more. - No. Absolutely not. - Look at those tiny little hands. - I know. I can't believe her. Looks so perfect. She's so peaceful. Thank you. We're lucky. I'm sorry I have to go to this work thing tonight. I wish I could stay here with you. - Help me. - Careful, it's slippery. Guys. Tomorrow, thank you. Good night, boys. I fucking hate Tequila! Everybody hates Tequila. That's the idea. Well, I... I didn't know what to get the man who has everything, so... He's got a career, a beautiful little baby... - Oh, my little baby. - ... a sexy wife. - Careful. - And then it hits me... I'm gonna get the man a Tequila hangover. So, Mitch, tomorrow morning, you are gonna wake up complete, my friend. That's right. - Thank you. Thank you. - I helped. Complete. You okay getting home? Yeah. Gonna get a... - gonna get a cab. - All right. Oh. - Hello? - This is a collect call from an inmate at Concord penitentiary. To accept this call, press 1. - Everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah. Ugh. See you tomorrow. Listen, when you throw up in the middle of the night, - aim away from your baby. - Yeah, I will. - Aim away from the baby. - Away from the baby. I promise. Don't puke on your child, Mitch. - I won't puke on my child. - Until tomorrow. Tomorrow. Don't be late! Inner-City taxi. Hey! Inner-City taxi. Hello? Can I help you guys? What the fuck? Oh, fuck it. Fuck. Fuck. What the fuck? Oh no. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh fuck. I'm so sorry. Oh shit. Hey, I'll get an ambulance. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Take this. It's okay. I'm gonna get help. I'm gonna get an ambulance, all right? Hold in there. Okay. Okay. Hey. Two minutes. I promise. - Don't leave me. - Just gonna call an ambulance. I'll be back in two minutes. 911, what's your emergency? I need an ambulance. A guy's been hit by a car. - What's the location, sir? - Uh, Keeler. - Keeler and 26th. - What's your name, sir? Please just hurry. Hurry, he's hurt real bad. Sir. The ambulance is coming. - Don't leave me. - I have to go. I can't stay. I can't stay. You'll be fine. I promise. I promise. I'm sorry. - Please. No. - I have to go. - Please. - Please. Please. Fuck. Fuck. An ambulance is coming, okay? Okay? Don't leave me, please. - There's daddy. Hey, lover. - Hey. What on earth are you doing up? - I didn't sleep great. - Hangover? Yeah. How are you? Well, apparently they wake up every two hours and they demand food. - Who knew? - Can I help? Yes, you could fix the garage doors. They're driving me crazy. Just gonna grab some diapers. ...blamed a ride home when she got into... ...in the third period, they mounted... ...remind everybody that no matter what the weather, the winter festival is happening... just be careful out there, folks. The weather is... - Mitch. - Uh-huh. Something you wanna tell me? What? About last night? - What? - And the car? Rach... uh... And why it's parked in the garage? Did you drive home? Yeah. - You promised to take a cab. - I know. No, I mean... What, are you crazy? 'Cause if you get a D.U.I., then you can kiss the D.A.'s office goodbye. I know. I know, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have. I won't do it again. Mitch, I am serious. You're a father now, okay? You can't afford to take chances. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. See? Look, even Ella agrees. Ella? Are you sure? Mm-hmm. Don't change the topic. I don't know what I'd do if I lost you guys. Mmm. Here, let me take her. You go to bed. Go get some rest. There you go. Thanks. Just an hour. Shh shh shh. - Hey. - You okay? Yeah. Could you call around the local hospitals and clinics? I'm trying to track down a young man who was involved in a hit-and-run accident last night around midnight. - What case is it connected to? - Just let me know what you find. - Yeah. - Over there. Thanks. - Morning, officers. - Good morning. - Good. This way. - Thanks. I'm down here in front of the police department with the story of the tragic death of this local young man. What started out as a routine traffic stop last night has turned into a gruesome murder investigation when police officers stopped this van parked behind me in the police impound for nothing more than a burnt-out taillight. When they saw blood dripping from the rear door, they demanded the driver open the van and it was then they discovered the body of Cecil Ackerman, a 24-year-old parolee from Naperville. Please don't. The driver claims he found Ackerman dying in the road from an apparent hit-and-run and was merely trying to get him to the hospital. This is Jeff Franklin, reporting live from the scene. Hey, counselor. Thanks. Yeah? - Detective Kanon? - Yeah. How many "T"s in "committed"? - Two. - Fucking paperwork. You got here fast. Yeah. You said you were interested in the Ackerman murder? Yes, I am. D.A. assigned just you? Well, it's just a provisional inquiry. Walk with me. Suspect's name is Clinton Davis. 55; Car mechanic; couple of assault charges, nothing he did time for; no relatives; Wife and daughter were murdered in a home invasion a few years back. Priest was in here already, saying what a good guy he is, how he'd never hurt a fly, - et cetera. - They said on the news that he found Cecil Ackerman in the road. Yeah, we've been there. No broken car parts, no blood that we could see. Yeah, but the snow thawed overnight, so... we've got Ackerman's blood and hair all over Davis's clothes. We've got the bloody tools and the plastic sheets in the back of his van. We've got enough to charge him. You guys need to decide if it's enough to convict. - He looks terrified. - He should be. He's staring down 20 to life for this one alone. This one? I ran some keywords through the database. It flagged a string of unsolved homicides. You think this guy's a serial killer? You don't even know that he killed this guy. Tell your boss we'll send him everything we got. - Mitch. - I have a request, sir. Thanks. Hey. Mitch Brockden, D.A.'s office. My associate Stuart Wilson. Terry Roberts, public defender's office. There you go. Mr. Davis, we're going to ask you a few questions about the night of the 4th. If you can answer as accurately as possible... You're gonna be my prosecutor? Uh, if this goes to trial, then yes, I am. I didn't do anything. I'm innocent. Then you've got nothing to worry about. Okay, Mr. Davis, let's start with you telling us where you were earlier that evening. Left work, went to group, went for a drive. Group? Yeah, I help out at some support groups. - And the drive? - Just something I do. It's not against the law, right? I mean, don't you ever go out and drive around at night? Due respect, I think that's beside the point. I don't like to spend too much time at home. It brings back memories... My wife and child. Uh, yes. I heard what happened to your family. I'm... I'm sorry. Emanuel fryer. Gunned down the next night attacking someone else's family. What do we know about the victim? Cecil Ackerman... registered sex offender; two counts of child sex abuse; Did two years inside; was only out on parole three months. So a real loss to society. So far there's no connection between him and Davis. - What about the murder weapon? - Weapons. The coroner couldn't be exact, but he suggested these wounds could be consistent with the type of tools and machine parts found in the back of Davis's van. - Could be? - Well, they also found significant amounts of oil and grit in the wounds, which corroborates Davis's hit-and-run story. True, but the Vic's D.N.A. And blood were all over Davis's clothes, inside his van. Which could've got there when he lifted Ackerman into his van. Yeah, or when he murdered him. Davis has two counts - of aggravated assault. - At a time when his family had just been murdered in a home invasion. He hasn't had so much as a parking ticket since. What's bothering you, Mitch? I don't see motive. Just got this audio file. Here's the transcript. It was a 911 call. Somebody called in an accident 20 minutes before Davis was picked up. By the time the ambulance arrived at the location, there was no one there. Okay, thank you. Is there any way we can find the caller? - No, he used a payphone. - How do you know that? If he used his cell, it would have his name, phone records. Okay, 911 call's potentially damaging, but it's not conclusive. And if we can't find the caller, defense probably can't either. Could be anyone in Chicago. Mitch, where were you that evening? - No, Mitch couldn't string a sentence together that night, right, Mitch? - Yeah, thanks, Stu. - If it was a hit-and-run, all it takes is for the guy who hit him to come forward and confess, and we're dead in the water. What's the likelihood of anybody doing that, huh? Bottom line: Do we have enough for a conviction? Davis was found with a dead man in his van. We have a ton of physical evidence. No alibi, a documented history of violence and his public defender's still in diapers. Mitch will eat him for breakfast. Charge him, murder one. You examined the body, doctor. In your professional... opinion, what was the cause of death? Blunt force trauma to the skull. And what caused that trauma? The back of the skull was badly crushed, so it's hard to narrow it down to any one item, but some of the marks seemed consistent with a hammer found in the suspect's van. And the interior was covered in grease and motor oil, so any type of violent struggle in that environment could've also caused those wounds and left that trace evidence. You said, "seemed consistent. " That's correct. Your report talks of abrasions and impact wounds with grease and motor oil in them. Now the defense I'm sure is gonna argue that... those wounds indicate that a car ran over Cecil Ackerman as per the defendant's testimony and that the rest is just... a misinterpretation of the evidence. No more questions, your honor. 911, what's your emergency? I need an ambulance. - A guy's been hit by a car. - What's the location, sir? Uh, Keeler. Keeler and 26th. What's your name, sir? Please just hurry. - Hurry, he's hurt real bad. - Sir. It's your witness, Mr. Brockden. Doctor, the jury will be unfamiliar with your field of expertise, so I'll ask quite a simple question. Just how accurate is forensic linguistics? - Extremely. - But it's not perfect? Perfection doesn't happen in science. Okay. On a sliding scale of one to 10 then... you may want to object, counselor. The witness's field is not on trial here. I'll withdraw the question, your honor. You stated earlier that you believe the caller to be genuine? By this I assume you mean he was reporting a real accident. Correct. And you can tell this just by... hearing his voice? It's more complicated than that, but yes. What else can you tell us about the caller? Hard to be certain from the quality of the tape. Sounded like a white male... possibly in his 30s... from the South of Chicago, but he's tried hard to soften the accent, not unlike yourself, counselor. Now you're from where, Riverdale? When you say it's hard to tell for certain... that the tape is unclear, that it seems to be a white male... The underlying ethnicity is hard to fully hide from trained ears. - Yes, it's a good recording. - Uh-huh. - Okay, thank you. - Thank you too. - Hey. - Staff meeting starts in five. Someone named Jimmy called, wouldn't leave a last name. Said to tell you he's out and wants to see you. Left a contact number. Do you want me to get him on the phone for you? No no no, thank you. Smell that? That's the smell of freedom. Hey, so I called your house the other day, you know, looking for ya. Your wife... she doesn't know who I am, does she? You've been gone a long time, Jimmy. How do you not tell her about your own fucking brother? Step-brother. And let's face it, legally not even that. - You wanna play like that. - Don't be fucking cute with me, Jimmy. I was working at that warehouse to pay my way through law school when you fucking hit it! I could've been done as a fucking accessory. Huh? - Bye-bye, career. - Yeah, I know. I was fucking stupid. Fuck, Mitch. I mean, Jesus, I was doing a lot of drugs back then. I was selfish. I've had a lot of fucking time to think about my life, think about who I was. Okay? Now I let you down. But I will not let you down again. Look... I met Rachel when I was graduating. She processed my application to the D.A.'s office. Seeing as my ma never officially married your dad... yeah, you figured why mention us, right? Jimmy, it was best for me not to have ties to a criminal past, you know? Once I'd lied on the forms, - I couldn't tell... - Yeah, I get it. I understand. - God. - I'm not that kid anymore. Riverdale, it's... It was another life. Well, lucky you. I only got the one. Hey. Hello? Hey, Mr. Brockden. It's Kanon. Detective Kanon. What can I do for you? Just checking in. We lost a point or two on that forensic linguist. Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's, umm... it's almost impossible to make Davis the caller, so... Right. It's kinda late, detective. Is there something you need? No, just wanted to know that you're ready for tomorrow. - What was that? - What? You're recording this? Why would I be recording this? They say that cops are paranoid. See you in court. She's asleep. Hey. Hey. You smell like milk. Ella was sick on me, again. Nice. Mitch. Hey. Look at me. Mitch. What is it? Is there something you're not telling me? Yes. What? Can't you just... Tell me? I love you. I love you too. All rise. Be seated. Before session begins, your honor, I would like to approach the bench. I will not tolerate tardiness, Mr. Roberts. I'm sorry, your honor, but there has been an important development. Defense would like to call a new witness. Objection, your honor. The prosecution wasn't informed of this. Defense was unaware of their identity until late last night. What is the relevance of this witness, Mr. Roberts? He's the man who made the 911 call. - What? What? - Order! Order. - Your honor... - I'm inclined to allow it, Mr. Brockden. Yes, I understand that, but if you could just... - Mr. Brockden! - Dr. Brown's lab ran a voice analysis overnight and we got a viable match. How soon can defense present this witness? Right away, your honor. He's been in the courtroom - this entire trial. - Your honor, please! Can I just please say some... Enough! Call your witness. The defense calls... - Jimmy Logan to the stand. - What? In a surprise twist of events, a witness came forward today and ended the prosecution's case against Clinton Davis. The witness saw the victim, Cecil Ackerman, mowed down by a hit-and-run driver in a red S.U.V. And left on the road to die. He then called 911. It seems that Clinton Davis was not the only good samaritan in this trial. Mr. Davis? I just wanted to wish you all the best. Yeah, it's like you said... if I was innocent, everything would work out. Yes, I did. So what happens now? - You go back to your life. - No no no, I mean with the hit-and-run driver, the one the witness saw. Maybe he'll turn himself in. Would you? I fucking love you, you fucking bitch! - Whore! - Stop it! - I'll fucking kill you! - Stop it! - No! Leave me alone! - Don't do this to me, you fucking bitch! I fucking love you! - Hey! - Fucking let me go! I fucking love you! The mutilated body of Pedro Gonzales was found early this morning on the bank of the Chicago river. According to a source at the coroner's office, the back of his skull was badly crushed, possibly by a hammer. His family says the last time anybody saw him alive was at the north mall on Saturday. I ran some keywords through the database. It flagged a string of unsolved homicides. I can't stay here. Shit! Oh fuck. No. No. I looked at the autopsy results. The wounds on Ackerman were similar to those found on Gonzales. Ackerman was a hit-and-run, remember? The wounds were inconclusive. You yourself pointed that out at the trial. Inconclusive, exactly. What if it was both? What if Ackerman ran into the path of a car because he was trying to get away from Davis who was in the process of torturing him? It explains why the forensics was so confusing. Anything else? Thanks for coming by. Hey. Oh fuck. Shit. Fuck. Yes sir... Oh shit. - Yeah, hello. - You get my photograph? - What do you want? - Stop following me. I know what you did. And yet the cops haven't come a'calling. Why you think that is, Mitch? If you knew I was the driver, why didn't you just turn me in, huh? I didn't want to play my ace in the police station. I needed to go to court. I had to get a jury of my peers to see your card, find me innocent. You wanted double jeopardy. Bingo. A free pass. - But you didn't expose me. - There was no need. I could see you were having a crisis of conscience. - Is this a fucking game to you? - Far from it. I won't let you get away with this. Yeah, you will, or I will ruin you. Besides, who's gonna protect Rachel and Ella when you get locked up for hit-and-run, hmm? What did you say? Family is a precious thing, Mitch. It's our job as men to protect 'em. Davis. Hey. Shut the door. Is that Ackerman? And the guy from the news. Have to work out what links all these men. How he's picking his victims and why. How who's picking them? Clinton Davis. What? These are the unsolved homicides that Kanon thinks match Davis's M.O. Davis's M.O.? Dav... Davis was innocent. Hit-and-run, Mitch. 911 caller proved it. Yeah, I wish it were that simple. What the hell is going on? What the hell is going on, Mitch? First you blow the Davis case, almost get yourself disbarred and now what? You're trying to prove that this guy is the goddamn Boston strangler? Stu, if I could explain this, I would. With what pathologists think were tools. The first took place eight months after Davis's family was tortured with similar tools. You see, I think he picked 'em. I think he picked all of them, but what the fuck do they all have in common? Well, Ackerman was a child molester. None of the others were. Well, they do all have criminal records. So you think this behavior started - with the death of his family, right? - Yes, I do. So remind me... what happened there? A man broke into their home and systematically tortured and butchered his wife and child... using similar tools to the ones that killed these guys. The guy made Davis watch the whole goddamn thing. Then he slit his throat and left him for dead. It was a miracle he survived. The guy's name was Emanuel Fryer... career criminal; gunned down the following night during another home invasion; recently paroled; Blah blah blah. - Broken home... - Oh shit. What? Gonzales, recently paroled. Fryer, recently paroled. Ackerman was recently... all these men are recently fucking paroled. Stu, you are a goddamn genius! Shit. I love you. I love you. Okay, so you're saying that the only reason Ackerman was in the street was because Davis was chasing him. - Uh-huh. - And then after you left, - Davis finished the job? - Exactly. If I could just get proof, you know? Davis can't be retried for Ackerman, but if I can get evidence that he... he killed those other guys, I can cut us both a deal. What you said under oath, what I did... You all right there? ...What I did, it just goes away. Mitch, I'm on parole. I get busted breaking into some guy's fucking house... come on, I don't want you breaking in. I'll break in. I just need for you to tail him, let me know when he's coming back. Ah, it's just a little aiding and abetting then. Eh. Forget it, Mitch. Let it go. I'm done. That fucker really break into your house? Yes. While we were sleeping. All right, he's gonna know your ride. Can you rent me a clean set of wheels? Of course. Thanks, Jimmy. You know what? I mean that. I may be an asshole, but I'm still your brother. See you later, Davis. All right, guys. See you later. Have a good evening. Yo, Jimmy. Got anything tying him to the victims? No. Not yet. Looks like he eats and sleeps here, but that's about it. The rest of the time he spends in self-help groups. You know, sometimes he goes to two a night. Oh fuck. That's it. That's how he picks his victims. The guy that killed his family was a parolee. They're all parolee meetings. Nobody notices the guy making coffee. He just hangs around like a fly on the wall, listening for the guy who feels worried about re-offending. Yeah, I've been to those meetings. - The room's full of guys like that. - Exactly. Fuck me. He kept their parolee cards. Jimmy, what's that? Uh, we're near the cement works. Must be coffee break or something. You know, that's pretty close. Is he coming back? I don't know. He went into some old warehouse and came out carrying something. I lost him. - Looked like some old tools or something. - Get the fuck outta there. Jimmy? Jimmy! Jimmy, can you hear me? Jimmy? Jimmy, are you there? I'm coming, Jimmy. I'm coming, Jimmy. Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! - Jimmy! - Aah! Fuck! Jimmy! - Mitch! - Jimmy! Help me! You gotta help me, Mitch! Help... Mitch. Yo, Jimmy! Oh, please help me! - Jimmy! - Mitch! Mitch! Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh Jimmy. 911, what is your emergency? Help me. Help me, please. He's trying to kill me. - Hurry. - Sir? Sir, who is trying to kill you? Sir? Sir, are you there? Sir? Hello? Yeah, I need an ambulance. Can you hear... can you hear me? Hello? Yeah, I need an ambulance. Fuck! Fuck! Stay with me. I'm gonna move you, okay? - Okay? - Okay. Okay okay, come on. Come on, stay with me! Come on! Let's go, men. Hey! - Hey, he needs an ambulance. - Set him down now! - Oh fuck. - Put him down! - Do it! - Put him down now! - Now! Down! Down! - Fuck. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Oh fuck. Go! - He needs an ambulance! - Cool it! Jimmy. Oh God, get him a fucking ambulance! Jimmy, hang in there. Hang in there, brother. - Hang in there, brother. - ... can and will be used against you... - Calm down. - Hang in there. You have the right to an attorney. We've got an injured white male. - How's Jimmy? - He's in a coma... ...but the doctors are hopeful. So you wanna tell me what your relationship is to him? Yeah, we're, um... step-brothers. Our parents just never married. That's why he'd lie for you in court. Exactly. So why turn on him now? What? Was he blackmailing you? What are you talking about? I didn't do this. Clinton Davis did this. - Using your hammer? - Yes. He broke into my house, he stole my tools. Did you report that? - No. - No. It's only your prints on the hammer. Jesus Christ. I made the 911 call, for Christ's sakes. Why would I do that if I was guilty? I really don't know, Mitch. But you did it before. 911, what's your emergency? I need an ambulance. A guy's been hit by a car. What's the location, sir? Uh, Keeler. - That's you, right? - Yes yes yes, it's me. I hit Ackerman with my car and I left. It was wrong. I know that, but I was scared. I'd been drinking. It was an accident. We found this... in the bottom of your toolbox. It has Ackerman's blood all over it. Well, Davis must've put it there. I dropped my cards when I was helping Ackerman. - I must've missed one. - All of this... - leads directly to you. - Oh, Jesus Christ. All right, listen, okay? If I killed Ackerman, why didn't I crucify Davis in court when I had the chance, hmm? He was the perfect scapegoat. Okay, there's a bag. - There's a bag? - Yes. Davis kept the I.D.S of all his victims. He's targeting violent parolees that he thinks will re-offend, like the man that killed his family. - Where's this bag? - In his house. How do you know this? - I broke in. - You broke in? You broke into his fucking house? Seriously, Mitch... How do I know you didn't put it there? You know, I don't think I should answer any more questions till I have a lawyer present. You know, I think that's a really good idea. You've got a call... Stuart Wilson from the D.A.'s office. Stu, where the fuck have you been? I'm sorry, Mitch. This is the only way they'd let me talk to you. Now you listen to me, you fucking son of a bitch. I will find you, I will come for you and I will take your life. - You hear me, Davis? - Oh, listen to you. Where was all that backbone when you hit Ackerman, huh? If you'd showed it then, you would've waited for the ambulance and he'd be alive. Course, he'd still be free to go around hurting small children... - ... which he was about to do when I took him. You do know that, right? If you'd let well enough alone, we never would've come to this place, Mitch. What do you want? You could've ruined my life or ruined yours, but yet you found a third option. One that helped us both. There is no fucking third option here. Yeah, there is. What if another murder happened with the same M.O. While they have you in custody, hmm? Go a long way towards shedding light on your innocence or even throw a reasonable doubt on your guilt. What are you... what are you talking about, - another murder? - The problem is you don't know my pain or my emptiness. But now you're going to know what it is to be me. Davis? Davis, what...? Where are you, Davis? Huh? I have to go now, Mitch. Davis! Hey! Is the line cut? Hey! I need a line. I need an outside line. - Davis is going to kill my wife! - Stop! - Hey! - He's gonna kill my fucking wife. - Mrs. Brockden? - Yes. I'm Detective Kanon. I hate to bother you at this ungodly hour, but I'd like to ask you some questions about your husband... ...if it's all right with you. No, not at all. Of co... I'm... just one minute. Suspect is approximately 5'5"... You know, I've been calling all day and I... I hope you don't mind. Hey, officer. Just finished up with a client. Can you tell me what you've arrested my husband for? - Murder. - What?! That... I mean, that's insane. Mitch... I know. I know it... it's crazy. And I personally don't believe he's guilty at all, but I just need to ask you some questions to clear... Could you get me a glass of water, please? Um, yeah, sure. Good night, counselor. Drive safe. There you go. Look, I just don't understand. If you know that he didn't do it, then why are you still holding him? Some of the other detectives are having a problem with his story. But like I said, once we have our conversation, I'm sure we can clear that all up. - He got a phone call and he went crazy. - Who called? Wilson or something from the D.A.'s office. He was ranting about making another call, said someone was gonna kill his wife. Davis. What the hell's going on in here? - Did you just call Mitch? - No. Get a unit over to Brockden's house now. Rachel! Rach! Oh, somebody! Somebody help me! - Get up. - No! Why are you doing this? - Get up. - No! Please, don't kill me. - No. - Don't hurt her! Mitch. Mitch. Toss the gun over here. Do it. Now, Rachel, I want you to bend down take that gun by the barrel and pass it to me. Whatever you're thinking of doing, Clinton, don't do it. Well, it looks like you just fucked up our reasonable doubt here, Mitch. What happened to your family was terrible. Doing this, it's... it's not gonna change that. I was protecting other people's families. Who's gonna protect yours now, Mitch? You? You understand now? Do you get it? Yeah, I get it. I get that you watched your wife and child tortured to death and you did nothing. I get that you're a fucking coward. You froze. You cared more about saving yourself than your own flesh and blood. - Mitch, please don't. - You think if you take out - as many parolees as possible... - Shut up. ...you'll make what happened to your family go away. - Please. - You know, if you were a man... a real man, you would've died first. I thought I was dead. I was hog-tied with my throat cut, but I wasn't so lucky. I had to watch my loved ones die. You're not tied up though, Mitch. So what are you gonna do, huh? Are you willing to die first? Yes. Yes, I am. We'll see about that. Oh! Mitch! No! You need to understand, to see someone you love bleed to death in front of your eyes. Please.
