My father's secretary. Need a ride? Going back to the office? Yes... I'd rather take a taxi. I see that you're still stubborn. We know that on the 28th of each month, you take money from the account. Don't worry. Get in. Come, I insist. - What are you doing? - A little loan, if you don't mind. You can't do that. That's theft! You're thieves! Fine. Help yourselves. After all, it's your father's money. She's right. If I take my father's money, it's not even theft. I hoped you would take us to a movie. I'm disappointed. Give it back to her. Give it back? The game is over. It was quite a laugh. It's a pity though... Toshio, it would be better if you stopped playing jokes on people. You'll end up in trouble. Same to you. You fake student. - You're a good for nothing. - Speak for yourself. Be careful with other people's money. It's good advice. That tricky broad. She doesn't lose anything by staying. I'll make her swallow her pride. Still, it makes me want to do something. All the money that I'll never have. It's crazy that it feels good to steal. Like a fury that explodes in a single blow, and tears down the walls of the old society! Stop it! You sound like a mass media commentator. Makes me sick. Good for nothing... Society is full of contradictions, you know. And in the case of Japan, with its fragile economy, you can see this problem immediately. All of us are here today. The more you want to protect yourself, the more unsatisfied you are. Even unconsciously. But it's not a question of pity or letting go of your feelings. Maybe not tomorrow, but someday I'll be out on the street. You're looking for excuses. No doubt... But by criticizing me, you've already lost the game. You're a whipped dog. Nonsense. What are you thinking? I haven't come here to grovel in front of you. Well, so much the better. If you're simply my rivals, I'll conduct this negotiation like any other. Mr. Akiyama, we're here to talk. I think we can come to a compromise. I'm afraid that's impossible. We really can't agree? How could we? You see, I honestly believe that all men are wolves. I wasn't expecting to hear such nonsense. I'm just going straight to the point. At least stay true to your creed. When dogs are beaten, they're ready to bark. Why are you laughing? That story about wolves. Oh yeah? Was it a strange argument? It wasn't strange. You look like one. You shouldn't laugh. Makes you look old. It wrinkles the corners of your eyes. It's just that there are wolves who threaten other wolves. And maybe you're just a nice little lamb. What do you mean by that? The wolves were after your money. When I left the bank, Toshio and his friends ambushed me. Idiots! They have no sense of value. That's all? You won't scold them? We no longer scold in a democracy. I'd feel too sorry for them. It's something from back in my time. That's enough. I know this speech. But there's surely a fault in your liberalism. Oh? It seems to me that this is the best education for my son. You're right, since liberalism pays off so well for you. Free trade, free competition... You're merciless! And we let it go. It's a shame nevertheless. You still on about that? This guy can't let it go. You two just don't understand. Jun and I needed cash. - Money is everything, huh? - Yeah. Sorry, we're not like you. If we didn't have money, everything would be easy. Easy? Go ahead, scorn us. I didn't say that with scorn. Whether it's money or something else, I envy people who are passionate about something. So it's not enough. Akiyama is missing out on passion! The prodigal son doesn't have it so bad. He has everything he wants, poor thing. This baby gangster in his tepid little bath. you want to leave your comfortable house? Chocolate in the morning. A life of luxury and rest every night. Long life guaranteed! You offended? As long as there's still anger, maybe all is not lost. So I'm a prodigal son and a chicken. However, it this were a real gun... What, you'd shoot? You wouldn't shoot! I wouldn't shoot either. Too noisy. You, leave him alone. Jun, it's your turn. Mom! Your son is a chicken and a good for nothing! But you must believe in me, Mom! I've suffered too. The world... The world has made me worthless! Mom! Don't cry if I die. Not a single tear. It would serve no purpose. I'll die laughing. Damn it all! Bravo! Great skill. - Most fun I've had all day. - Don't make me laugh so much. - I'll cry! - You want a gun now, Akiyama? - It's a fun toy. - Let's drink. To our great actor! Jun, get up. Cheers! - Can I come in? - What is it? - Your father wants you. - Is he home? - He's back early for once. - I think he's about to leave. Nothing but father and son. Must not be fun. He's gonna get a good talking to. Hey! Turn it down so they don't hear. I can't turn it down. I need to hear it at full volume, with my body. - They're still back there? - Yes. I wish you would see them less often. Your buddies aren't worth much. It doesn't even bother me to say it. You're the only one who gets it. When you go to college next year, you won't have any problem finding ways to keep yourself busy. I understand. Is that all you wanted to say? No. You need money? No, not really. It seems that you were part of an ambush outside the bank. We did it for laughs. But Makino was scared. She said that you drive like wolves. - Wolves... - She thought you were thugs. How can I even respond to that? From now on, if you need money, talk to me first. - Okay? - Yes. That's all. You can go. - Was he mad? - My dad never gets mad. I guess. He's an understanding father. And you're a son who isn't big enough to fight. The nerve of saying that we're wolves... - Who? Your father? - The secretary. That tricky broad? I swear I'll make her swallow her pride soon. I'm home. What's wrong? What happened? Nothing. Still in a bad mood? That's not it. Then what is it? Tell me. What can you do? - It doesn't concern you. - Oh really? We live together. If you're grumpy all the time, I can't bear it. - It's the bills. - The bills? Hisako's still at it. She bought a refrigerator on credit. Washing machine, vacuum cleaner, television... Even the pots and pans were on credit. It takes up most of my income. She's clueless about being thrifty. It's not like we can afford the luxury... But, Dear! It's not like I need luxury. All our neighbors already have a refrigerator. So what? You just want to impress them? That nonsense is the reason I have to sweat all day at the office? You're being unfair! I just hoped that when you come home tired, I'd be able to serve you a cold beer. It's already starting to get hot. That's why I wanted it so much. You still don't understand. That's just being wasteful. You need to think ahead. You don't know how I have to suffer every day. - You only think of yourself. - Idiot! How harsh. You're a bit of a tyrant today. You don't know how it feels to be poorly paid. I know, but remember that I also work every day. That's no reason to take it out on Hisako. And Hisako, you love my brother don't you? Why all the arguments? He's too selfish. I'll return the refrigerator tomorrow. Good riddance. You don't need to return it. I can pay for part of it. Come on, let's eat. I'm starving. Not eating? It seems that the life of a salaryman is pretty good. As soon as you get home, you do a crossword puzzle, or you argue. You'll become like this too. I absolutely will not. You think so? I also thought that. Then one day, you're stuck in your routine. So... "hold"... "hope"... "kebabs"... "grill"? So... you wanna go out? To do what? Well... To have dinner somewhere. - And go see a movie. - Mr. Shinohara, you think that's a fun plan? - Very fun. - Really? You have nothing better to do after a hard day's work than to try your luck with every girl at the office. Am I right? - You knew. - Of course. They all talk about it. But I feel sorry about this way of killing time. You're a funny girl, not like they say. Yes, they all say that I'm not easy to get along with. But it's just the opposite. I like you, so... If you really... I'd like to apologize for the other day. - Would you like to get in? - No thanks. Don't say you won't get in. Or else I'll have a problem. - Why is that? - Akiyama. He insists that you come. - He's having a party. - I won't go. I have no time to waste with bad boys. Don't be so spiteful. - Get in... - Hey you! This lady has a date with me. Get lost. - What manners... - I was here first. - Goodbye. - Hey... Wanna go out? I'll take you to a restaruant. You really have no manners... You wouldn't have come otherwise. I didn't say that. That guy was really pushy. You came at a good time. Will you take me home? I'll take you to the party. I don't want to. Leave me alone. We need you to come. It's not like I can go to a party in this dress. What nonsense. What's this dress? I borrowed it for you. How cheeky you are! It's "cheeky" now? That's better than last time. Last time, you called me a good for nothing. Oh yeah. Good for nothing really suits you best. Hey, can we stop by my place? No way. We need you to come. You don't trust me. I'll go, but I need to go home and prepare. Women are so complicated. Come on, you can change here. - Here? - We come here with Akiyama. - Is the back room empty? - Yes. You can change in the other room. You guys loaf about in a place like this? - Tragic youth. - We're not tragic youth. Hurry up and get changed. - What's with the girl? - Taking her to a party. - You shouldn't bother. - There's money to win tonight. Money? How? Akiyama pays for the party and we collect money. And that girl ends up cheated? She's not the type who's easily cheated. So she's your girlfriend? I have nothing to do with her. Akiyama invited her. I forgot. You're not interested in girls. I'm not interested in anything. This is no good, see? It's not my size. You look great. I should tell you now, so there's no misunderstanding... I didn't come because of you tonight. I came because I was in a bad mood, get it? - This party seems rather expensive. - It's important that you enjoy it. - This dance is boring! - I'm okay with it. That's ridiculous. I keep telling you that it's boring. - So why did you come? - I'm easygoing, just like you. - Girls are no fun. - It's the same with boys. Yes, you're right. Humans are no fun. - I'm getting sleepy. - I wish you were more romantic. You're putting me to sleep. I don't want anything big, just a little piece of paradise. I'm sure that you'll get it. - A little two-bedroom, 4000 yen. - Great. In life, you must be happy with what you have. - This party seems rather expensive. - Why do you keep saying that? It's important that you enjoy it. I've prepared a surprise for you this evening. Someone that Jun will bring soon. Who? A guest of Akiyama, can't be anyone special. Oh really? Get ready to welcome a great chanteuse. What's her name? - Ikuko Makino. - I'm not familiar with that name. She just returned from France. She's not really big in Japan yet. But over there, she performs in the cabarets and music halls. - Was she there very long? - About four years. You'll be amazed. Grco, Montand... - She knew them very well. - What? Montand? This may be the first time she sings in Japan. - Isn't it wonderful? - Jun is running late... - He might have been stood up. - He's not that dumb. She must be getting dressed up. Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have brought Takako. She loves French songs. - What are you talking about? - Ikuko Makino, the chanteuse. You going to request a song? I wouldn't know what to do. Yeah, that would be dumb. Hey, Toshio? You should make a request. Please. - They're expecting you. - A lot of people? Not many. It won't even cover costs. Wait a minute. I'll get Akiyama. He's the one who tried to take my money in the car. Yeah, he's the type that would do that. What about you? Me? I'm not that different. I see. That's why you're so tight with them. How can you demean yourself like that? Thanks for coming. I was losing hope. Tonight, I hang out with the bad boys. You look beautiful. Follow me. Ladies and Gentlemen... On this special evening, we have the honor to host... Miss Ikuko Makino. - Is this a joke? - We applaud your arrival. - So, you know Montand? - Grco always dresses in black? - What is this, Toshio? - I couldn't keep it a secret. They say that you spent four years in Paris. We really want you to sing. Please! Is it okay, Toshio? If it's okay with her. - Please? A song? - Yes, please. - What will you sing? - "La Vie en Rose" - "Autumn Leaves" - A new one? Let's go. Come on. - Oh, a black out! - I don't like this. - It's fine with me that it's all dark! - Don't take advantage! Get in. Son of a bitch! Is this a bad joke? - Who turned the table over? - They're playing stupid games! Turn the lights on, quick! My dress got wet. Who's responsible for this farce? - This party is worthless! - Idiot! You can see that the party's over. Jun was responsible for this. What a funny guy. There are limits when it comes to practical jokes. - It's despicable. - Akiyama's just playing a game. The game has gone too far. I didn't think you were so shameless. Don't be like that. I didn't even do anything. You were an accomplice at least. Whatever you say. But actually, you saved me by turning the lights out. Don't give me so much credit. Why not? You ask too many questions. We just wanted to rile you up. Still, you saved me. It's all the same. What if you stopped seeing those guys? Why do you even hang out with them? I guess I have nothing better to do with my life. You're such an idiot! I'm an idiot now? After being a good for nothing, after being the lowest... Now I'm an idiot. Yes, it's not so bad to be an idiot. - What are you doing? - You laugh too loud. Women quickly lower their guard when they're surprised. You've made yourself clear. This is how a good for nothing behaves. What kind of girl do you think I am? If you thought I'd give in so easily, you're mistaken. Get a hold of yourself. - I have to make a call. - Go ahead. Akiyama Trading? Can you get the secretary, Miss Makino, on the line? Even though you got everyone together, you still played a dirty trick. You'll have to spend 8000 yen. Here's the bill. ashtrays, chairs... Great job breaking all that. It was already hard to cover costs. I don't have any money. Don't just joke around. We're not gonna pay the bill. We don't need 8000 yen this moment. Just give what you have. I've got nothing. If you don't believe me, check my room. We knew you'd say that. But we have a plan. Ikuko Makino. Akiyama plans to bring her here. - You'll bring her here and then what? - We'll collect. - Collect? - Yeah, she'll pay for the damage. - She can do that, right? - She won't come. If she doesn't come, you'll get the money. Couldn't you steal it? I don't want to. She had nothing to do with this. If you're gonna be like that, pay it yourself! Pay up, now! Wait, you can't leave 'til we're done. What are you doing? - Nothing. I'll pay you. - Bastard! What did she say? She's bringing the money here. That was easy. She's a pushover. Good work, my friend. She's ours. She won't pay! I won't let anyone pay for me! Leave it to me! Stop! Stop, I said! - I'll pay the 8000 yen. - You'll pay nothing! I won't let Akiyama or anyone pay for me! Jun, she's here. - Where'd you get it? - An advance on my pay. - That settles it. - Keep it. Keep it? You said you needed it. He paid in your place. Toshio, take it. I don't want to owe you anything. I just ask one thing. Please don't call me anymore. Hear that Jun? Don't call her anymore. She wasn't talking to me. - What happened to your face? - When he heard you were paying, this idiot got angry. See how he loves you? - A woman can't resist. - Stop joking. I'll pay Akiyama when I can. The money's yours. Give it to Toshio or do what you want. I don't need it. It's yours. Take it. No, it's my thanks for when you saved me. Now we're even. It really would be better if you didn't see them anymore. Today, it was only blows to the face. But some day they might destroy you. What can archaeology, especially Japanese archaeology, what can it say about our time? This is the question I'd like to ask. It seems simple at first, but it's not, when you think about it. We must first ask ourselves how archaeology and its interpretations vary over time. In Europe, it's called "archaeology." Ever since it first existed, it has changed at least four times... Jun! You going to class? It's not very often... that we see you in class. What? You still mad about the other day? I'm not mad. Akiyama wants to know if you're coming tonight. To keep him company again? - I'm tired. - It's different tonight. It's his dad's birthday. I don't give a damn. He invited everyone from work and there will be plenty to eat. You coming? I bet you have nothing to eat at your little shack. You couldn't offer such a feast. I have lived only with conviction, or perhaps I should say... it's the quality that has allowed me to survive. Otherwise, if men were basically good, they wouldn't start these unneccesary wars. The trade that we practice every day wouldn't be possible. Those are the contradictions of capitalism. I don't want to pretend to be more malicious than I am. That type of person is left wanting forever, without a doubt. Your conviction was useful in the last negotiation. You crushed your opponent. You even had the heavy hand. Because you don't show your feelings easily, Boss. You would be the first to point out a mistake. These are the men who invented the rules. Those who wear a mask of virtue, only to stab you in the back later... They seem far more despicable to me. Jun, stuff yourself enough for at least three days. Otherwise, what's the point of boring yourself coming here? The boss has always had no style. It's just for show. He must have a bit of a guilty conscience. It all depresses me. Talking like he's the top of the heap in Japan today. It's hopeless. Well I can't completely disagree. I'd surely be doing the same thing in his place. You? Yeah, you'll be the same someday. You'll gather everyone together just to say that all men are wolves. I'm not the only one. You criticize us now, but wait 'til you're married. The wife of a salaryman tired of domestic life. I'm not like that. Everything annoys you. I get bored and I chase after girls. Basically, it's the same thing. But it's true that you showed your nice side the other day. I can start again if you want. You came. But I told you that you don't belong here. That's my business. I don't take orders from you. It's you again. This time, I'm here first. - Get lost. - I don't take orders from you either. - I should teach you some manners. - Stop this childishness. I should just let some kid make fun of me? You in a bad mood? Don't make trouble. It's better for you that way. Leave him. You don't know what he's capable of. - Let's go. - I'd rather stay here a while. With such an unpleasant guy? He's not so bad. I'm leaving. Arguing with children is not my idea of a good time. You managed to get rid of him. Here's your money. I knew that I'd find you here. So that's why you came? Thank you. - It would be better if you left. - Why? - I'm not welcome here? - You're wasting your time. Not at all. You're different from the others. There's nobody else like you in my life. It's always people obsessed with work, or corrupted by money. I'm not how you imagine me. A good for nothing, you said so. No, I understand now. You don't understand how often I go broke wasting money. But you didn't waste it. I came tonight because I was tired of my regular hangout. Quit lying to me. You should really stop hanging out with them. Toshio likes to let a conflict spread, like measles among children. He likes to rile people up and watch the show. Rich people are like that. You heard us? I'm just sulking in my corner. And I did hear you. Doesn't matter. I didn't say anything stupid. Nothing stupid. You're absolutely right. But it was so funny. I'm dying with laughter. What for? To think that you've been reduced to a romance with this young man! What nerve! You're impossible! Why do those cretins have to laugh like that? Jun, we can't leave you all alone. - Come back out. - No thanks. You've fallen for a strange woman. - I don't think so. - Is that so? She's not your type. You wanna come with me to the sea tomorrow? Anything is better than this chaos. I'll be staying in Hayama all summer, in a house that I rent. You can come. What is it? You gonna do what she tells you, and not hang out anymore? I think I'll get a summer job. Forget the job. That's not what you need. Come with me. It's so hot! Hey, what's up? I feel better lying down. It's too hot to move. Hey, you got any cash? Give me some. - I got nothing. - Just a little. Didn't you get a job? Chauffeur without a permit. It didn't last long. Your folks don't send you money? I thought about going home, but can't afford the ticket. With no money, you're stuck. Our freedom today was bought with money! What a plague. Just let me lay here. I'd sure like a cold beer. You wanna meet up with Akiyama in Hayama? We can't keep leeching off him. But still, it's better than staying in this suffocating place. We can swim in the ocean. And then he'll just get bored. I knew you'd come. It's too hot in Tokyo. We had to get out of there. Fujieda won't come until tomorrow. Jun, didn't you get a job? He's too lazy for that! I let him crash at my place. Let's swim. You coming? No, I'd rather just sit here and watch the horizon. You have unhealthy habits. Who's the unhealthy one? He just came for my money. So did I. It's true that a refrigerator is practical. He blamed me, but he's happy just to have cold beer. Here's your chance for the good life. A housewife wishes for nothing else... than to stay at home all day. So if that's what you want, get married! No thanks. Sorry, but you still have to live with me here. I didn't mean it that way. Brother, the life of a salaryman isn't so bad, with a wife to serve you cold beer when you get home. Don't fool yourself. You talk like that's my only pleasure. I still have all the refrigerator bills to pay. Yes, and you still haven't finished paying off the TV. Why bother working? I don't even know why I exist. Maybe for this glass of beer. This expensive beer. Actually, we're leaving tomorrow for a couple days. - You'll watch the house. - Where are you going? - Hisako's parents. - You going for vacation? Like we could afford it. Hisako's pregnant. - You're gonna have a baby? - Apparently. So that's why wou haven't been quarreling as much. Congratulations. I don't know how we're going to deal with the new expenses. - That's also why I'm going. - You're gonna be a daddy. That's how love stories often end. How what ends? I was talking about us. Not at all. Hisako, congratulations. Shin'ichi was against it. - I wasn't against it... - You didn't seem happy about it. Think about the future. I can't always be optimistic like you. You look bored. Who are you? A good for nothing. Good for nothing? An "almost" then. - Why an "almost"? - Almost is good. Well, I can't be almost. I'm either all good or all bad. Which is it? That Jun sure has some nerve. This morning he was just lying around, and now he's caught a girl! He's unwinding. Jun, unwinding? He's not like you. He feels bad about leeching off me. What? So I'm the only one who likes to leech from people? Indeed. Come on, it's not like we're sucking you dry. Are we? I've decided. You're not an "almost." You're an "all good." - You're too naive. - I am not! Fun, ain't it? Dancing with my chick? You were right. Jun's unwinding. My folks got the idea to send me to America. I'm not too keen on rotting here in Japan. - I decided to go. - When do you leave? End of September. You won't even graduate? Being a graduate of a Japanese university isn't a big deal. Liar. You're failing, so they're shipping you off to America. - Well that's part of it... - You're so lucky! You rich folk can just flee to America. Right, Jun? The rest of us are still stuck in Japan. I'm not so lucky. I have to learn English before Fall. That's what worries me. That's the least of your worries. You'll come home having learned American habits. Japan will throw a party for you. - What are you doing? - Going back in the water. I'll never get to go anywhere. I can only adore America from afar! So, have you saluted America? Nothing but salt. Doesn't even taste like Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola, good one! Why don't you go to America? You could. Everywhere is the same. As long as we can't get off of this world. We can't even get clear of Japan so easily. - You think like your father. - Certainly not. Summer will end soon. So will our sad youth. Maybe. It was pitiful... So pitiful. - I'm going back to Tokyo. - To do what? That dirty place wasn't made for humans. If I don't earn any money before Fall, I'll be stuck for sure. It really has ended, our youth. Look! It's that tricky broad! My father got her to bring money. Well, I guess we should take it then. From the boss. Is that good enough? - How much is it? - I don't know. He thought that you would need money. Don't waste it. He stayed in Tokyo to work, despite the heat. My father loves to make money. I just spend it for him. Always acting like the bad boy. You wanna swim? You can't go in the water dressed like that. No thanks. I have no desire to stay any longer with you. Or maybe you have no confidence in your physique. - Jun, where you going? - Back to Tokyo. What's the point of going back? - Apparently to look for a job. - Who? Jun? What's gotten into him? - What are you doing? - I'm leaving. You're kidding. Stay a little longer with us. It's no good if you have a crush on him. He already has someone. I'm leaving. No message for the boss, I'm guessing? None. That woman is downright crazy for Jun. You going back to Tokyo for work? That's good. Clinging onto Toshio like a bunch of leeches is pitiful. So, if you're looking for work, why not come work for us? We're recruiting students to send out catalogs. What? Don't want to? Nope. What an answer! You're not fit for it anyway. I'm hungry. Incredible. You're too much fun for sure. Do you want to come to my house? I'll fix you a nice meal. Sound good? I've never invited anyone over. I'm not very sure of myself. - This might not be very good. - No big deal. It changes me a little, repeating the same things every day. I don't know, sometimes I get a little sad. Why do you take such an interest in me? Why indeed... Probably because you're a good for nothing. Hey, could you give me a hand? What are you doing? Idiot! You thought that would make me happy? What are you laughing about? I just remembered that you're a wolf. A wolf? An irresponsible wolf. Who only knows how to bark and howl. I knew that one day you would bite me. You're leaving? Remember you start your job tomorrow, okay? Makino, if you don't mind, I'd like to invite you over today. That's too bad. I'll be busy. Really? - You have something to celebrate? - Why? That's usually the case whenever you invite me. If so, shouldn't you go home early? For Toshio. Are you afraid for him? I'm not afraid. At his age, everyone acts like a rebel. He doesn't care what I say. That's no reason to just leave him alone. Actually, don't you think he feels abandoned? Maybe. But I don't think he would do anything that goes too far. Maybe that's a presumption on my part. I think you're taking this a bit too lightly. However, at no time in history have men been able to do whatever they want. Same for Toshio. When he understands that, he'll return. Like the return of the prodigal son. Still working? I'll be waiting outside. That job looks pretty boring. When I saw you, I felt a little sorry for you. But it's better than lying around all day. It helps to say that. Don't you worry about me. Worry? I have no intention to do so. That's good. I prefer to be left alone. I see. You don't want a woman involved in your business. - You're back? - I just left this morning. The beach was deserted. My dad's your boss now, huh? - That's nice for you. - It's also nice to be working. Certainly, but it's too soon for me to live the life of a salaryman. Jun, let's split. You're going? Do you want to go? I don't want to be tied to anyone. She just watched you leave. Is that okay? - I don't care. - Don't care? Figures. Now where do we go? Anywhere. As long as it's exciting. Oh, there you are. When I called, they told me you had left. I had a feeling you'd come back. I have to talk to you. Coming from you, I expect the worst. It's not what you think. I'm tired of these stupid games. Just relax. I'm sick of it all. The desire to watch the sea's horizon everyday. That's all I understand. All that remains is suicide then. Yeah, if I had a gun. I have a gun. Wanna buy it? You've always wanted one, right? For real? My friend here... would be happy to sell it. I'll show you over there. See? It's good. Buy it. - Is it loaded? - No. It's no good if it's not loaded. This isn't a toy. I don't think you can handle it. If you're really interested, I have bullets too. I'll buy it. How much? Here's your share. Don't do anything stupid with it. No nonsense. This gun has a criminal record. Shoot yourself in the head if you want, that's all. Jun, can you do it? Your first-rate acting will be much stronger now. You were right. I'm just a good for nothing... But don't cry when you hear of my death. I don't want you to cry... I love you... I love you. I did something stupid... And now... Enough of this stupid nonsense! That's how you end your romantic scene? Jun, are you in love? I see. You slept with her. You're wrong. How awkward! You're the only one still working. - Too much to do. - You want me to help? - No. - I'll help. Afterwards, you wanna go see a movie? There's a great Western out. Let's go! I'll be waiting outside. That's the boss' secretary. How do you know her? I could go for a movie. Really? You want to? Good! Let's finish quickly. You wanna go out? It looks like the prodigal son's friend has found work here? - You look bothered. - I won't let you... Don't get upset. I say this because I'm happy. You and I are very much alike. We flirt to relieve boredom. - You'll go out with me some day. - Not on your life. I thought you'd never come. Aren't you ashamed? Always following Toshio around. I told you to leave me alone. Out of the question! Thanks for waiting. Let's go. Wait. I have something to tell you. - Go on ahead. - You'll meet me soon? You're really impossible. I'm a rascal. You should know. I know. I know that too well. But I beg you. No affairs with the office girls. You won't do that. You won't, right? I'm quitting tomorrow. Why don't you want to listen? Come in! You're hard to find. Why didn't you come to work? I told you I quit. What for? Stop already. I don't have to give you my reasons. That's so like you. But even so, when I see you, I forget everything. Well that's your problem. When I came here looking for you, I had plenty of things to say to you. But then I thought it would serve no purpose. Me too, I wanted to tell you something the other day. Weren't you in the process of telling me about your past? What past? For me, it was just a bit of fun... Nothing but a bit of fun. And I thought you were bored. - So I comforted you, that's all. - Don't say that. Listen to me. I don't want any misunderstanding between us. Did you think we were made for each other? Not at all. I don't understand why you don't see that. Why are you telling me this? I have no intention of boring you with what happened. - It was my idea from the start. - Then what's the problem? That's not what I wanted to tell you. You think you're a good for nothing, but actually you're just weak. You cheat yourself, thinking you're clever. Is that how you want to live your life? It's not just me. Everyone is a cheater. I had thought that maybe you were different. But you're a coward! - Spare me your whining. - I'm not whining! You are! And I don't like you following me! - I don't follow you! - Then why are you here? Akiyama rightly said that you were reduced to... chasing after a young man. You're going? Then go, after hearing what I have to say! Ikuko locked herself in her room without eating. Think she's okay? Must be the heat. It's too hot this summer. Still, she didn't want to talk to me... Think something happened at work? A case of hysteria, it'll pass. Oh, "hysteria" might work... Good evening. You know some strange places. - Who brought you here? - What does it matter? Mizuwari please. And you? I'll have the same. It's whiskey. Do you drink? Why wouldn't I drink? - Something happened to you. - It's nothing. Today, it was you who asked me out. Something must have happened. Yes. My only excuse is that I was bored. If that bothers you, you can leave. Bother me? It's an honor. But I don't get it. The tricky broad has suddenly changed. It's surprising. A little. I'm an ordinary woman. Sometimes I want a man. What? Don't look at me like that! I like you. Let's toast to our united boredom. What a surprise to see you here. How so? I just came to witness your debauchery. Nice compliment! I would've invited you to my table, but I changed my mind. I understand now. You come here with his type. - Yes. - Wouldn't you rather be with him? - You're forcing yourself for me. - Tonight, I came with you. - I love you. - You love me? Yes, it's true that those words exist. "I love you..." Look over there. She'll be happy. Still being stubborn? Or you're waiting for her to come... She'll come... She won't come. She'll come... She won't come. Jun... Wanna bet? Which do you choose? You've also become a common woman. I've always been a common woman. Relatively intelligent, relatively stupid, relatively good for nothing... A woman with whom everything is relative. Well, I'm also becoming a common man. - You wanna get married? - Married? People who are alike should get married. It seems only natural. Is this fun for you? This game? What game? I'm dead serious. It's nothing but a joke. Who's being serious? You believe what you're saying? You don't believe it at all. Cheater! Cheater? Perhaps. Both of us deserve pity. Autumn already! But why regret an eternal sun, if we are committed to the discovery of divine light, far from those who die with the seasons. Stop reading such depressing stuff. Don't you have anything lighter? Something lighter doesn't exist. Don't be so specific. I looked, but found nothing. It's not worthy of you. It seems like in the Autumn, everyone becomes sentimental. Akiyama, where are we going? Hey! What's with your ugly mug? We'll go drinking together, okay? Autumn already! But why regret an eternal sun, if we are committed to the discovery of divine light, far from those who die with the seasons. Autumn. Our boat... Any news about Fujieda? He's getting ready for America. Lucky. Ah, the rich... - When does he leave? - Pretty soon. End of September, he said. Even though he's a bastard, we'll miss him when he's gone. What a failure. He should be ashamed. You're right. He had his fun hanging out with us, and then, "bye, I'm leaving." It's hard to believe. But maybe it's for the best. There's a time when friends must part ways. What, you leaving too? We'll part ways eventually. We can't keep living like this. You too, Jun? Can't be helped. You two are no fun anymore. So docile all of a sudden. What's happening? Since this has been decided, we'll have our farewell party today. Farewell to our youth. - Let's drink to it! - Wait! I haven't said I'm okay with this. If you're not okay, you can continue on your own. You can't get away so easily. We've been together until now. Fine, we'll go out with a bang. It's September 28. We'll look after your father's money. As thieves. Once was enough. No, this time it's different. It's not a game. We'll do it for real. What? You're surprised? Right now, I desperately need money. I have to pay my tuition. I also have debts. - I want to borrow from your father. - Extort him? Yeah. Got a problem? This time, you'll give it to me. And not just 10 or 20,000. I don't have it. Then I'll borrow from your father. You anticipated this. He's an understanding man. - He won't say no. - Morishita, drop it. - Akiyama is getting annoyed. - Annoyed? Even better. With Akiyama, it's all about nothingness. Despair, anguish, but only in his head! In reality, he's not capable of anything. I desperately need money. Give it to me. What do you say? Okay. I won't come along. But do what you want. Good. It will be our last game. - Jun, let's go. - I'm not going. Not going? Why? Jun can't go. - Why can't he go? - He's in love with the secretary. Jun and that woman? What next? That's too funny! Don't laugh! It's not true! Look how worked up you are. You're definitely in love. Jun, you're on the wrong path. - Akiyama just made it up. - Then you'll follow me. So? You'll follow me? Now there's the real Jun! Akiyama, pass me your gun. - What for? - To prove that this isn't a game. Give me the bullets too. Without bullets, it's like a toy gun. You don't have to threaten her to get what you want. No, she won't believe us. She'll think it's just a game. What, you scared? Yeah, you are. Kids from good families aren't used to these dangerous things. You don't even have the courage to kill yourself. Am I right? So give me the bullets! It's just a game. Okay? Don't do anything stupid. Don't worry. I'll pay you back some day. Jun, you're an idiot. Rich folk only watch the spectacle. They don't get involved. There's no limit to human greed. It's neverending. Soon as you've reached a certain level, you're already aiming for the next. Even with similar results in our first quarter? They greatly exceed our expectations. The quest for profit is merciless. He who laughs last wins. Hello? Mr. Akiyama's office. What? I'll get your father. It's you I want to talk to. It's the 28th. Isn't this the day you withdraw from the bank? I don't want you to go. I forbid it! Why? Why forbid it? You're planning something, aren't you? Same as last time. They'll be hiding outside, waiting for you to come out. You never change. This doesn't surprise me. Do what you want. This time it's for real. They're really going to rob you. Who? Who's waiting for me? And Jun is with him. Your Jun. I don't know what they're capable of. If you don't go, they'll settle down. So don't go today. Wait until tomorrow. Do as I say. Okay. I'll be ready. - Who called? - No one, it was for me. It's the 28th. I'll go to the bank. Oh, I forgot. Take the bag. No more games, it's over. She's late. It's been 10 minutes already. Doing this for real is more exciting than before. I need to calm down. I have to admit this game is dangerous. She's coming out. Get in. We'll take you to the office. You don't trust us? It's okay. You can rest assured we won't do it again. Actually, I have a proposition to make. You hear me? What is it? That money. I'd like to borrow it. I'm not the person you should be asking. Akiyama already knows. Give it to me. Toshio can say what he wants. My boss entrusted it to me. You can't have it. Are you dumb or what? Come on, give it! How dare you! And you're going along with it! Crazy idiot! Good for nothing! I didn't think you would come. That's why I'm here. If I had known you'd be here... I never would have come! - What's wrong with you? - Give it back. I told you to give it back. No way. I need it. Akiyama's okay with it. What are you doing? Watch out! Let him go! Stop it! What are you doing? Stop! Stop! Look out! Here you go. Take it. Idiot! You're such an idiot! There's no money in here. Just scraps of paper. Look, I'll show you. Blank paper. You didn't believe me either. That's not true. Doesn't matter. I gave it back anyway. Now we're even. There's nothing between us. No, you're wrong! You can say what you want, but it's not true for me. You still don't get it? There's nothing between us. A game. Get it? It's... a game. THE END
