I saw a story where a guy went nuts on house arrest and he cut off his own foot so that he could escape to Mexico. Some urban legend. I'll be stopping by from time to time. I won't call first. Keep moving around. Use the pool to exercise. Five seconds, the light goes red. You are to have no unescorted minors in the house, no drugs, no alcohol... and no contact with Mona Wilson. Is that understood? - Can't hear you. - Yes, sir. I told you guys to use the fence. So, let's see it. Wow. You're like Shia "Laboof" in that movie with the creep next door. It's "Labuff." Did... Did you bring it? Because I really want to Skype my mom, so... Yeah. We used Jimmy Dolt's house. The bank foreclosed, but the cable's still on. Buried the router, like you said. Good looking out. Did you guys... bring anything else? I'm... I'm not saying she's not hot. I'm just saying if you're gonna start with somebody, shouldn't you pick, like, a cheerleader or at least a blonde? I wasn't into her. And then... Then what? One day you just woke up and you were smitten with Mona Wilson? So much that you had to hack every account she had online? I couldn't hack her cloud. I just... - wanted to get to know her. - You try calling her? - You know I can't talk to girls. - I'm a girl. I'm a fucking creep. - You're not a fucking creep, dude. - Totally. - Shit. I got to go to work. - Yeah. I got to study. - Later, bro. - Later. - Later. - Bye. I... snagged you one of these. Kevin and I both signed it. - Thanks. - Anytime. Waiting for your ambien to kick in? Yeah. I heard Laura Penney took her great Dane for a walk around the block stark naked on that shit. That is foul. Did your mom get online? She'll send you something dope for your birthday if she can. Yeah. We should do something special for it... your birthday... just the two of us. Daniel? Hello? Daniel? Daniel? It's not easy for me to talk to you. I never expected for things to be like this. Everything just went wrong. - Look, I just... - You will feel what I feel. - I just wanted to... - Reach for the unknown. It's just such a tragedy to lose anyone so young. That was principal Ariana Nakata from Los Alamos High School, where the tragic suicide of teen Mona Wilson has left many... - We didn't do this. - ...questions about the lives of children... Reach... for the unknown. "When my soul no longer takes this form..." "And you hear me singing in the storm." It's just an elysian fields song. You'll be okay? Go. Seems like whoever got the call had taken some sophisticated steps to mask their identity. The forensic team was impressed. Well, the thing with cyber crimes, with all the 1s and 0s, it doesn't matter how good you are. Even the best will leave a trace sooner or later. My friends downtown... they're worried about the one who got the call, the one that had to see all this. Yeah, a thing like that... can haunt somebody forever. Keeping something like this a secret... that is just poison. How's that bracelet treating you? It's fine. Well... I better be on my way. See you around. Is this Tina? It's Daniel. Daniel. Jason's son. Well, do you know where he is? Well, if... if you hear from him, could you just tell him that I called? So, he didn't leave any... Hello? What the fuck? I'm calling an ambulance. No. - Sorry. - That's okay. You should soak that. I brought you something. I folded them by hand. There's 1,000 of them in there. This is... Happy Birthday. I got it. If you need to talk to someone, I can get a recommendation from Jamie Chubinsky. His dad wrote a book on P.T.S.D. or something. Mona Wilson is haunting me. You take your meds last night? That's got nothing to do with this. Now you're busting your head open on the kitchen floor? - With the star jar. - This is different. I got to go study. Look, I understand this is probably a huge headfuck. But you don't believe me? That what... that Mona Wilson's coming back from the dead to haunt you? It was an invasion of privacy. That doesn't warrant suicide, much less a fucking haunting. Look, you're fucked up, man. You've been fucked up. You don't call us. You don't talk to us. All you want to do is sit in the house and think about Mona. It was my fault. That's bullshit. She was crazy as shit. She was gonna do this one way or the other. - Fuck you. - No, fuck you. I don't have to ask around. There's a pretty clear consensus on who this girl was. Forget it. She never even fucking talked to anybody. She just walked around, listening to her emotional-ass music, acting like she was better than the rest of us. - She was misunderstood. - A misunderstood bitch. A selfish bitch, and nothing proves that more than her deciding to make you watch her blow her fucking head off. You have any idea how long Abby worked on those stars? Kevin? - She wants to hurt me. - Let's get inside the house. She wants to hurt me like I hurt her. "You will feel what I feel." What else could that possibly mean? I mean, she wants to fucking punish me for what I did to her. - Where is it? - What? The e-mail. - Don't look at me like that. - Daniel... You don't think I want this to be over? I could feel her, okay? - I could smell her perfume. She was here. - Look, I'm gonna stay, okay? I'm gonna stay the night. My dad's working the graveyard shift. If anything weird goes on, I'll be here to see it. Okay? - Come on. Try harder. - I am trying. Rematch? I can't see straight. Well, how 'bout some mad libs? I brought "animals, animals, animals," "camp days," and "bachelorette bash." No. What was it... about her? She was... just perfect. And... there's this feeling in my stomach every time I think about her. That's all? I mean... isn't that all it ever is? All what ever is? Love. No. And perfection has nothing to do with it. It's about knowing how fucked up somebody is, how stupid and blind they are, knowing all those things, and still seeing the light in them, even though all they see in themselves is shit. And you know it's real when you don't get that feeling in your stomach anymore, but it doesn't matter. You don't need to feel that to know that... no matter what twisted, dark shit gets dropped on either one of you, you'll be there to bail each other out... because you're best fucking friends. ...may not be Mr. right, but he is certainly Mr. smooth. Daniel?! Maybe... if I can set it straight, somehow let her know that I didn't mean to hurt her... let her know how much I cared. What do you want us to do? Your mom is gonna lose it. They don't like silence, so it suggests neutral tones. Read from the top. "When dealing with an unwelcome presence, it's important to remember that some spirits won't move on because of attachments to earthly pleasures. Others are tethered by strong emotions, like love or revenge." - Daniel, this is... - Look, it takes three people. If this doesn't work, then I'm fucking nuts, and that's that. "Form a circle of hands, palms down before you, fingers touching. Guilty party addresses the scorned spirit... confirms motives before attempting to amend harms. Clear your minds of hindering thoughts and breathe as one." Mona Wilson... We are gathered here today to ask you why you haven't moved on. Guess she's still not much of a conversationalist. We are calling on you to answer this question by guiding these quills through our own hands. Hold your writing implements, close your eyes, and await communication. Abby! Daniel! Abby! We have to call someone. The police or your probation guy. And tell them what? That we were having a sance and we stabbed you in the hand and then an evil spirit wrote my name on the wall in your blood? You're not even supposed to be here. Yeah, well, at least it'll get you the fuck out of here. You saw what she wrote on the wall. She's not after the house. How long do you think I'm gonna last in a 6-by-9-foot cell with bars on the door or a padded room? Maybe if I can convince the cops that I'm being haunted, they'll hook me up with some 4-point restraints or a fucking straitjacket! The shit you found online about contacting spirits, that worked, right? So? So, who's to say that this shit about getting rid of them isn't just as legit? Look, right now I'm ready to fucking try anything. Following a saging session, natural-fiber brooms can be used to sweep the home from west to east. ...employ a combination of absorbent powders, along with a series... Stones should be arranged throughout the house, following these hygienic measures to anchor the positive energies... ...electrical and microwaves by focusing on naturally occurring... A solitary practitioner can easily construct... Try to feel natural... ...throughout the house, following these hygienic measures... White rice seems to have a particular potency... ...hanging text from ceilings to alter the energy flow in the room. Consumer-grade cameras can be modified to see further into the ultraviolet... ...into the light spectrum by altering or removing internal filters. ...establishing a multicamera surveillance grid throughout the affected environment. Compasses haven't moved. Same with the electronics. They aren't attracting anything. I haven't heard a thing from the chimes. We'll stick around. I got sick days. I'll call into work and tell 'em. No. I'm okay. Hey, Abby? Thanks. Anytime. Like tying a knot You stiffened to me And when it got taut You tore yourself free Oh, darlin', how could you dare? You won't be climbing my dark hair From reservoirs of maiden stars Lead us on You will not find the forest floor Where I lie Oh, darlin', it's not your kiss Pressing me deep in the loaminess As crimson leaves fall from the trees As we roll And shadows bow on the path Where we stroll I want to erase The contours we made And tumbling from grace How quickly we fade O, darlin', how could you dare? You won't be climbing my dark hair As pounding waves flood through the maze... - How you doing, buddy? - Pretty good. Say hello to your wife. I've been doing this for so long... I don't remember anything else. Smokes? Well... Most of the time, when I look up from that file into the eyes of the boy in front of me... I can see it's... it's too late. Now, I'm not saying that I'm... having a sixth sense or anything like that. I do have a good eye for badness. Now and then... I look up from that file. I'll be damned if I can't see anything. You were on that call that night. Yeah, yeah. You saw what she did to herself. I'm gonna write this off... like some equipment malfunction, whatever. Listen closely. One more signal from that device... it's out of my hands. Yeah. It's out of my hands. Daniel? - What the fuck? - Daniel?! Daniel! I mean, we have to find an adult that will listen to us. - I am an adult. - There's got to be something we missed. Look, anyone that's gonna listen to this shit and not have me locked up on the spot is crazier than I am. Totems. What? Use a totem. "Some report increased success calming vengeful spirits when in possession of a totem, a personal item with profound and positive emotional resonance to the spirit. This personal item binds the spirit to the physical world and gives you some influence over its actions." Totems? Their system's been on "away" for a week straight. Their garage hasn't been opened either, and the grocery-delivery service is on hold. Guess they decided to mourn somewhere else. I can kill the alarm, but keep an eye out for patrols. This place is like a fucking castle. In back. The east side. Come on. It should be straight ahead now. There. That's it. Parents of the fucking year. Christ. Girl didn't even own a pair of earrings. What the fuck? Looks like your dream girl liked to cut herself. Not too much positive emotional resonance in here. Hey. Right. Pan it right. The north wall... it shouldn't be there. Well, it is. What the fuck? Are you getting this shit? Jesus. Go back. There. Stop there. Holy shit. She was stalking him? What is that? "Goddess's servants I do hire. Enchant the object of my desire. Fill his mind with thoughts of me, that I be his queen and he my bee." Let's get the fuck out of here. Falkaroth. It's not easy for me to talk to you. I never expected for things to be like this. Everything just went wrong. You will feel what I feel. Reach for the unknown. Where were you?! We almost got busted! I got into her cloud. It was a spell... a fucking enchantment spell. It worked, but she didn't count on me being too much of a pussy to actually go through with it, so she cast a second one. - What? - I think it's in Latin. This is about possession. - What, like demonic possession? - No, this is different. It's about inhabiting the body of another to form a union. The first step is set your spirit free under the gaze of the one you desire. Read the next one. The second step is make him read a verse that unlocks your heart. Fuck. "When my soul no longer takes this form..." The third one is make him draw the symbol of your goddesses' choosing. Fuck. I traced it... to do an image search. The fourth step is make him shed his own blood by his own hand. Shit. If someone who loves you performs the fifth step without doing the others first, - the spell fails. - What's the fifth step? - Fuck. - Come on! Go, go, go, go! I love you. Daniel! - Come on! - Daniel, we have to go! Get down! Shit! - Run! Run! - Shit! Watch out! Oh, fuck! Hurry! - Your mom's room! - Go, go, go! Come on! Fifth step... what's the fifth step?! I can't see anything! Make him burn pieces of the witch. Burn pieces? What the fuck does that mean?! Pieces of the witch. You will feel what I feel. What the fuck? If someone that loves you does the fifth step... without doing the others... The spell fails. You could say you had a party. - Me? - Hey, man, it could happen. Hey, five bucks a cup buys a lot of candles, right, Abby? Yo, Abby. Abby? Read a verse that unlocks your heart. "And you hear me singing in the storm." Draw the symbol of your goddesses' choosing. Shed his own blood by his own hand. Burn pieces of the witch. Abby's gone, baby. It's okay. I won't let them find us. Help! Help! Daniel? Hey, Daniel! Fuckin' kid. Help!
