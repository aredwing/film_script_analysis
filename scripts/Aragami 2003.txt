I did what i could... ... but his wounds were too deep. I see. I have no family. He was like a brother to me. Im sorry. War is cruel to everyone. Where is he? I cleaned his body... ...changed his kimono... ...and laid him in another room. You did? Thats one more thing I must thank you for. Dont let it concern you. This is a very unusual temple. Are you its priest? No. It was derelict. Not many come this deep into the mountains. I dont get along with people very well. Ive been living here for years. I see. And the lady? Well, its a bit complicated. Shes been here for years. Anyway, what are you going to do? Now? Yes. Ill take... ...his body back to his home. I have no home, but he does. Thats the only way I can mourn him. Thank you for everything. Ill take my leave. Whats your hurry? The enemy will be looking for you on the road you came. To the west is a sheer cliff. You could go down it, but in this rain... ...it might collapse. I say this for your own good. Rest the night here. I have few guests. I dislike society, so Ive retired to this temple. Im glad to have someone to drink with after so long. I know, considering your friend,that this is not an auspicious encounter... ...but perhaps this,too, is some kind of destiny. Well? Lets drink the night away... ...and sit vigil for him. Ill take you up on that, then. You have my thanks. No, you have mine. Well make a night of it. This is a drink called "wine", from a land called "France". Its made from grapes. A strange taste... ...but a good one. Isnt it? Drink up! This liquor, and this temple... Its all new to me. Is all of this from foreign lands? Yes. I traveled far before I chanced upon this temple. And that Buddha, is it foreign, too? The face is strange. I carved it. You? Yes.Living here, i have lots and lots of time. Its quite something! Its not so much Buddha as a carving of me. Do you see? Perhaps a little, now you mention it. Speak your mind. Its a very heavy rain. Well, it should stop by tomorrow. The mountain roads are dangerous. And there is a legend they tell of this mountain. Do you know it? No. They say the long-nosed goblin haunts this mountain. "Tengu"? Who haunts this forest, who seizes men to eat? The very same. "Tengu" rules this mountain. He hears the drop of a pin. He sees a thousand leagues. He scents the difference between a mans blood and a beasts... ...and he eats only flesh. But "Tengu" is just the name... ...that people give him. Hes really "Aragami"... ...a fury of wild violence, the Raging God of Battle. You seem to know this well. But isnt something as dangerous as that... ...a threat to this temple? Not really. Because this "Aragami"... ...is me. You had me there! Sorry, sorry. But "Tengu" legend is real. Even if he did appear, you look like a strong man with a sword. You could handle him. What about you? To survive that battle, and those wounds... Im sure more than a few men have fallen before you. Tell me... ...how many have you killed? To count them would be in very bad taste. Oh? So you kill men in uncounted numbers... ...and forget? Shouldnt you remember the lives you take? Ive killed 794. I remember... ...their shape, their voice... ...the last look on their face... ...everything. May I see my friend? He scents the difference between a mans blood and a beasts. I smell it... You reek of blood! Enough! Youre drunk. Ill be on my way. Ill come back and thank you properly. Oh? No, Id like you to do that now. I want you... ...to kill me. Are you mad? I told you... I am Aragami. But Ive lived far too long. Ive been waiting for the one who will grant me death. But it is not easy for Aragami... ...to have himself killed. Only a man worthy of the deed can cut me down. This is crazy! Why would I kill the man who saved my life? Thats why I ask. Youre in my dept. Stop, will you? You look like a man to me. Not "Tengu" or "Aragami". Not all is what it seems. Not even a man. One with a saintly face may betray you. One with an innocent face may be prostitute. One with an evil face may be good. All right, lets say you really are Aragami. Why should I kill you? Take me to my friend, damn it! Youre a samurai. You have a duty to accept my challenge. Why do I have a duty to fight the man who saved my life? You are no longer who you were when you came. Think about it. Isnt it strange? You came here two days ago... ...with 13 sword cuts and four arrows stuck in you. Your wounds had festered, and you had a high fever. And now? Once a crazed lord kidnapped large numbers of small babies. He believed he needed them to concoct a potion of immortality. He thought newborns held untold possibility... ...as nourishment... in the treatment of wounds of disease and old age. Now, while this lord... ...was simply a lunatic... ...his idea was not completely wrong. There is a mysterious power... ...in human flesh. My friend... Where is he? To take your body... ...past its limits... ...the human liver is best. Yes. You ate the flesh of your friend. He bacame part of you, and gave you strength... ...otherwise you were dead by now. You bastard! I understand how you feel. How about another drink first. What are you? Hey, hey, hey! Will you look at this sword! Its about ready to snap. This looks like it could be fun. The nights still young. Lets take our time. Shut up! Huh? You go too far! Stop looking like youre dying. Its just a scratch. Hey... hey. Give it a rest. See? But you arent immortal, you know. The head... ...or the heart kills you. Anyway, lets have another drink. Now, this liquor is from a land called Russia. They call it vodka. Its pretty strong. Its from corn. Anyway, have a drink. Do you think Im giong to just sit and drink?! How come Im not dead?! I told you. You ate the liver... So you just eat someones liver and you dont die? Dont be silly. Look. ...no two cooks make the same thing the same way. This woman is a good cook. An excellent one. So. Are you a demon,too? Its been said that women are devils, hasnt it? Shes more a devil than I am. While youre at it... ...could you kill her, too? Hey! Whats in that?! I said it was strong. What do you want? Why are you doing this to me?! How many times do I have to tell you? I want to die. Fighting is the only reason to live. Ive always hoped Id meet someone stronger... ...but Im tired This body of mine will never get any older. Im not able to die naturally Why not cut your stomach open,then? Dont ask me to kill you! Hara-kiri? Thats something mortals do from excessive self-respect... ...and stupid pride. I am without fault. Why would I do that? Besides. I am Aragami, the Raging God of Battle. I was born to die in battle. And i cant be cut down by some backwoods samurai. No. I will die when I encounter the one. Sophistry. Nothing you say makes any sense at all! Its absurd! Then let me ask you... ...do mortals make sense? Shabby politicians start wars where you kill each other by the thousand. Isnt that the reason youre here, and your friend is dead? Isnt that absurd? Listen... ...the existence of this world is absurd. All right, then. ...why did you kill him and choose me? You were both half-dead. I could only save one. But why me and not him? No reason. I just chose you, thats all. Would you rather youd died and been eaten instead? And look, I didnt kill him. I gave you the chance to survive. I could have let you both die. But, now you have the chance to live. Theres a big difference. Consider yourself lucky you have the chance. Make the best of it. Who do you think you are?! You bring people here to split hairs, and then kill them. What chance have I got? Its just murder! Not all the ones I killed were people. They werent? Wherd he go? Sometimes demons or goblins look like people. There are beings in the world that are beyond imagination. They made me realize that I wasnt human... ...that I was Aragami. Demons, goblins, Aragami... what are you talking about? As I told you, the world isnt always what it seems. Many who look human arent so at all. Warriors who defeat vast numbers of the enemy... Miraculous survivors of disease or accident... People say theyre lucky... ...but thats not it. Thyre human, but then again theyre not. Oh, I get it. If youre Aragami, maybe I am, too. Maybe. Thats not true! Neither of us looks anything other than human. Some birds fly high up in the sky, but some never leave the ground. Its not strange that humans come in different forms. My being here... ...is proof of existence beyond what is known. I say white, you say black. I just dont see it. No, you wouldnt. I used to think I was human, too. I went looking for battle from the moment I was born... ...and I fought lots of men. No one could beat me. I couldnt help wondering why I was so strong. And then in time the whole world knew my name. I became feared No man would face me in a fair fight any more. Wait... What is that name the whole world knew? Who, me? Yeah. Miyamoto Musashi. Musashi? Youre the Musashi who never met his match? It doesnt matter now what my name was. But he died years ago! Yeah, thats what I heard. You know "rumors". Youre historys greatest samurai in the world? ...and also youre an inhuman Aragami? Is that it? Yeah, something like that. And you want me to fight a monster like you? Thats right. What an idiot! Ow! That hurts! Sorry, sorry. Youre Musashi! Ow! Ow! Give me a break! What the hell. Ive already died once. Alright. Your swords no good any more. Take what you like. No, not that one. Thats mine. You said to take one. Sorry. I recommend... ...that western one. Its called a "broadsword". Its heavy, and it cuts. The owners of these weapons are all dead... ...so feel free. Forget that sickle-and-chain. The rooms too small. Too many pillars. How will a bears-claw help? Ninja stars are for losers. That guns good. Its a "pistol". The latest weapon from the west. It fires a bullet with gunpowder, like a matchclock. It wont be easy to hit me with it, of course. Hey, wait a minute. Shooting me when I was asleep wouldnt be much fun. I thought Id wake you up. I am not able to sleep. Tell me... ...have you ever dreamed? Of course. I dont sleep, so I never have. Thats too bad. A good dream is fun. Id like to try it someday... dreaming. About the gun... You have to pull the hammer back to fire. That was your friends sword. Its a good one. Killing me with it would be a nice way to mourn. So thats your choice? So you mean to win... Youre my kind. We cant turn away from fighting. If were the same kind, and youre Aragami... ...what does that make me? Beat me and youll find out. Im glad we met. Thats a sneaky trick! Yes! I like that! Thats why I chose you. This is the central moment of your life. Stake body and soul, present. past and future... ...and show me! Youre the man I chose. Cant you do better than that? The hammer... You wont beat me with that. I guess not. I thought maybe he was the one. Is there no one in this world who can stand against me? He was a real samurai. Give him a good funeral. You? The world isnt always what it seems. Didnt you say that? Yes, I did. Im sure you have no equal under heaven. But look up... ...therere millions of stars above. Youve made me realize what I really am. This is indeed a world of wonder. Fascinating. Youre the one Ive been waiting for. You werent waiting for me. I was searching for you. Thanks. This is the best moment in my life. What manner of being are you? Beat me and youll find out. I see... The world is so wide, and still full of mystery... Now you can sleep. I can? So this is sleep... Hey... ...do you think... ...I can dream, too? Yeah. I wonder what hes dreaming... What will you do? Ill stay here... ...with you. You will stay here... ...and continue your battle. Oh,well... Ive got nowhere to go. I guess Ill stay. Aragami... I wonder whos going to beat me. Ill be here to see.
