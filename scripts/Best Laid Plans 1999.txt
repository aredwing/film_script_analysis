He still plays-- back-up center|in the Canadian league. All this remember-when,|where-are-they-now shit. That was college. Can we please talk|about something else? You know what?|I had a thought. Shit. No. Yes. Last night I was|reading The History of Twentieth Century|America in your honor. Whose, Manchester's? No. Big thick text|by... Schlessinger.|Halberston. I'm not going to|remember. Well, authors' names|don't really matter in your trade, anyway,|do they? I work in the English|department. We deal in fiction. I can tell the little|shits any name I like. Your thought? Oh, yes. Right.|I was reading 1 960s sexual revolution free|love wife-swapping-- sort of like|an after-dinner, free-spirit parlor game. The husbands used to|throw their key chains onto the table,|mix them up, then the wives would all|pick them up blindly. Buddies fucking|each other's wives, et cetera, et cetera. Now think when|our parents were born. OK, now, think|when we were born. We could be the offspring|of a key chain adultery. You get it? We may not|be our fathers' sons. Oh, it gives me hope,|anyway. Waitress: Two more 7 and 7 s. Jesus, another round? Thank you. I haven't finished|this one yet. Thank you. To your first month|in Tropico. Stay hydrated. Everybody sucks but us. [Sirens] Man: Oh, I have|a joke for you. There's this elephant|in the jungle, and he's got a thorn|caught in his foot. This mouse wanders by.|Elephant stops him and says, '' Hey,|I'll give you anything if you take the thorn|out of my foot.'' [Groaning] [Telephone Ringing] Hi. How'd it go? Man: Nick, I--I--|Nick, can you do me a favor? Bryce? Can you come over here?|Yeah, it's me. I know it's late,|but I need you to-- Yeah. No.|I was expecting-- Well, it-- it's me.|I got a problem over here. I got--|I got a serious-- OK. Can it wait?|Because it's after-- Can't wait.|I need a friend to talk to. Look, I'm in big|fucking shit! OK. Please. Please, Nick. OK. [Tearful]|Thanks, buddy. Bye. Bye. [Firemen Shouting] How'd this happen? Ah, brush fire season. The slightest thing will|spark one of these off. You want to take a left|here and proceed slowly up towards the right,|all right? Drive safe. Thanks. [Firemen Shouting] [Knock On Door] [Beeping] Oh, shit. Morning. Hey. Jesus, you look|like I feel. Well, I feel|like it, too. You want a beer? All I've got|is domestic shit. That'll be fine. Thanks. These people you're sitting for,|they keep a lovely home. So, you want to tell me|why I'm here? I got laid tonight. How wonderful for you. No. I didn't bring you here|at 2:00 a.m. for bragging rights, OK?|Because if I tell you this, you got to make sure you're not going|to tell anybody, that it stays between us.|OK, Nick? OK? The girl that|we met at the bar? - Katie?|- No. Kathy. Oh, boy. What happened? You left. She and I--|we talked for a while. You know,|she bought me a round. And then she asked|if I wanted to leave, and so we came here. So we starting making out.|She initiated it. She did this funny thing|with her hand. And she was kissing me,|like squeezing my jaw. Bryce, broad strokes.|Broad strokes. Sorry. Sorry. It's like I blinked,|and we were naked. And then I, uh...|We did it. Yeah? Afterwards, she went|to the bathroom. Couple minutes,|came out, asked if I had|any vitamin C. - What?|- Yeah. So I went upstairs,|and I found some, and I came back down. And she had called|a cab and said|she was going home, and that|when she got there, she was going to|call the police and file rape charges|against me. She says I raped her,|Nick. Bryce, is there|any truth to this? No. I'm sorry because I haven't seen|you since college and suddenly I lay|all this shit on you. Is there any truth|to what she's saying? I don't--|I don't think so. You don't think so,|or you know so? Listen,|I was pretty drunk, and I can't fucking|remember if she tried to stop|anything. But she says she did. Are you just hazy on this,|or were you-- No. It's a mix. I was in and out|during the act. I don't remember! Well, you don't seem|very drunk right now. Well, a chick|accusing you of rape will sober you up|just like that. Jesus. I don't know.|Maybe-- Maybe she won't|go through with it. Otherwise, I don't know|what to tell you, Bryce. Sit tight,|for Christ's sake. Whatever you do, don't|tell anyone about this-- not now, not ever. What? Oh, fuck. Oh, Nick,|I really fucked up! Bryce? You know, Nick,|can you talk to her? Just tell her|it was an accident. Fuck! I hate to lay|this shit on you. Hey. Hey. Shh.|Calm down, OK? Hey. The girl is gone. There's nothing|we can do. OK? No. Come on, Bryce. No! She's not gone! She's downstairs! God. She's downstairs. This is going to look|worse than it is. See, after she said|what she said, after what she was|going to do, I-- See, Nick,|I didn't hit her. All I did was grab her|and drag her, and then, coming down|the stairs, she fell... Where are the lights? Over on the wall. What the fuck|are you doing? I, um, well, uh, I need|to think through this. Not what are you|thinking, what the fuck|are you doing? How long has she|been down here? I'm not sure because my sense of time|is all fucked up. Guess. Um, I dragged her down,|and I tried to talk to her, and I called you.|Maybe half an hour? You didn't touch|her after that? No, Nick, I swear|I didn't touch her. [Crying Softly] Bryce: Nick-- No!Just--Just|hold on a minute. Um... But, Nick-- Oh, fuck! [Kathy Crying] Nick, come on.|It's not my place. Goddamn it, Bryce. Look, I'm sorry, Nick.|When she said that she was going to|call the cops, I tried to stop her to|find out what happened, and she kept going|for the door, and I just lost it. Nick, I swear to God, I didn't touch her|after that. It's OK. It's OK. Where'd you get these? Upstairs. I found them|in the parents' bedroom. You have the key? The key? Why? I'm going to|take them off. Uh-huh.|And then what? And then I'm going|to drive her home. Bryce: Could we talk|about this first? Bryce, give me the key! I know this looks bad,|and I screwed up. But I don't think|I did before what she said I did, and I want to|talk about it first. What is there|to talk about? What the hell|is going to happen to me if we just let her go? What the hell is going to|happen to you if we don't? This chick is going|to ruin my life. She's going to fuck|it all up. Bryce, give me the key. No. [Crying] Shh. It's OK. I'm sorry if that hurt.|It's Kathy, right? Are you OK? All right, look.|This is pretty crazy here. This situation is|not very good. I know. I'm going to take you out|of here in a minute. I'm going to drive you home. But first I need to know|if you're all right. I mean, are you injured|at all? OK, OK. Look.|Take a deep breath, OK? Just breathe in, OK? [Inhales] Good. Yep.|Now exhale. Let it out. OK.|It's all right. OK. You're doing great.|You're a real pro. OK, now, listen.|Are you hurt? Are you hurt anywhere? My lip. Yeah, I can see that,|but it's nothing serious. It's just a little cut. But what I want to know is,|what about the rest of you? Are you hurt|inside anywhere? No? OK. Good. Your friend|didn't hurt me. No? I don't care|what he did before. I won't tell anybody. I just want to get|out of here. I just want to go home. I just want to go home. Lis-- Listen-- I just want to go home. I just want to go home, and then everything|will be fine. You will. I promise you. I promise.|I promise you will. Just hold on. Hey, Professor...|come on. We'll be back|in a minute. Everything's going|to be fine, OK? Bryce: You don't|believe her, do you? Because the second|she gets home, she's going to|call the cops. Yeah, she might. The thing is,|you got to let her|go now. But there's more to this. What? What? What? Look at that. OK? Now this one. She's 1 6. I mean, what 21 -year-old|carries around a fake I.D. saying she's 1 6? The girl downstairs|is 1 6! I mean, it doesn't|matter if she said no. It doesn't matter|if she screamed yes and had a notary public|certify it, she's underage!|It's statutory! If she presses charges,|I will go to jail! So I guess a second date's|out of the question then, huh? Do you see?|Do you see now? Do you see|how fucked I am? Bryce, statutory cases are very, very hard|to prosecute. No. The girl is 1 6.|I had sex with her. Boom. Conviction.|You know what? And it's not just jail.|It's my job, my career, my entire education|shot to blistering fuck! Can you imagine explaining|a statutory rape conviction or even an accusation|to a tenure committee? Can you? Bryce, sit down. You're going to wear tracks|in these people's carpet. I only wanted|to get laid. Instead,|I'm getting fucked! Nick, I want to let|the girl go. I'm raring to get her|the hell out of here, but the only way|I can do that is if she can guarantee|that she won't tell anyone, and I don't see|how she can do that. You won't take|her promise? She's shown herself to be|a pillar of truthfulness. And I can't bribe her.|I've got nothing to offer. And-- Past that, and my thinking|just fails me. I-- I don't think|I could threaten her. I could. What? I already played|the good cop down there, so maybe if I go down|and pull a reversal? Scare the shit out of her. We're fucked. You're telling me. P.A.: Welcome to Tropico|Recycling Company. Glass goes... [Glass Clinking] Nick! Sorry, man. I forgot|about your dad's funeral. Of all days, Barry. I'm really sorry. [Cat Screeches] [Cat Moaning] Oh, shit! Man: Is it yours? Nick: No.|My neighbor's. He home? We OK if I say|she was dead on arrival? Yeah. I'm going to|put her down. Um, excuse me. The shot costs $30.00. I'm sorry. It's the least|I can do. There you go. Thanks. Here's 1 0 back. Cheap absolution. I'm sorry.|I'm really running late. Oh, OK. Go ahead. I'll just get the info|from her collar. Thank you. Shit! Ah, shit. Ever feel like the world's|conspiring against you? My name's Nick,|by the way. Mine's Myrtle. Myrtle. Really? [Chuckling] No. Thank God. It's Lissa. I was just trying to|lower your expectations. Two Ss? Yeah. It's short|for Melissa. When I was learning|to talk, I used to pronounce|it '' Me Lissa,'' as in '' Me Tarzan,''|so the story goes. Thanks for the lift. [Praying] Let the Lord lift up His|countenance about him and give him peace.|Amen. Nick: I never would|have come back here after college,|but my father got sick, so I came home|to take care of him. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm. So anyway,|what's your excuse? I took the equivalency exam|after sophomore year-- off to be an actress. Actress? What, ''actress''? Can never be sure|if you're being straight, with you. You can never be sure,|anyway. So the first camera|I got in front of-- this incredibly|imposing machinery, like, right in my face-- and I just...froze. [Chuckles] Claustrophobic,|I think. So it's back to home|and school and the local vet|to make a buck. How long have you|lived here? All my life. Me, too.|Lafayette High. Me, too. So back to school where,|S.U.T.? Mm-hmm. The extension program,|studying art. My dad taught there.|Chaired the history department. Really? This was before they|put him in the urn. Waitress:|Here you go, sweetie. Thank you. Are you all done here? Mm-hmm. Thanks. So in an effort to avoid|a similar fate, next week I will plunder|my father's belongings for their few items|of value, go collect my inheritance, and when all that|is accomplished, I will quietly, promptly|leave Tropico. Just that easy? No. Well... it's been nice|meeting you. I'm sorry we didn't|till now. Thanks for lunch. Thanks for dinner. Thanks for the wake. [Chuckles] # I try so hard to remember # Bye. Bye. #What it is that I forgot # # But I can't|but I can't believe # #Will you now # # I've tried|I've tried, I've tried # # Cried and kissed them bye # [Giggling] # Something that we both know # # Boy, you're on my mind # # I don't know|how I'm going to # # Show you what I feel for you # # But all I know|all I know is I # # I want to be with you # #All I know|All I know is I # #All I know|All I know is I # # I got to be with you # Rumor has it he was|a pretty good teacher. I think you would have|liked him. This is what he looked like. Hmm... hmm... Very sexy. Really? Really? Hmm. [Elevator Bell Rings] Sorry. Sorry. [Knock On Door] Oh, hi, Nick. How are you?|Good to see you. Nick. Hi. Come in. Sit down. I'm really sorry|about your father. Yeah. I'm going to|miss him. I brought|his favorite pen. I've got news. St. Vincent's Memorial conducted an autopsy|on your father and discovered that|his liver was near failure-- a condition which your father|apparently knew of and failed to list on his life insurance|application, which constitutes|a deliberate misrepresentation and invalidates|his policy. Which means what, that I--|that I would-- You don't get|the insurance money. As a result, I've had to|inform the I.R.S. of a new compensation|schedule until the sale|of the house is complete. Wait, wait, wait.|The I.R.S.? Your father didn't|mention his back tax... No. obligation. Your father owed|$200,000 in back taxes. Uh, consequently,|these assets are subject to a lien, so the government|has seized them all. Well, his estate|should constitute more than that,|right? After house payments,|your college tuition, uh, my fees... What's left over? It depends on the sale|of the house, which the bank|has seized title of. What do I get? If it goes|for the asking price, after taxes... Ah. Nothing. Barry: So... did everything go OK|with your lawyer? Huh? Are you going|to get the money? Yeah. It was fine. Oh, sorry|about that. So, you going to|give your notice? No. I thought I'd|stick around a little longer. Anyway, if I go,|who's going to get my job? I don't know. [Car Horn Honks] Mmm. Uh, see you later. Woman: You know, you really|have to use a little imagination when you're looking|at an old house like this. It's a really nice|opportunity-- a fixer-upper for first-time|buyers like yourselves. It's a very good buy. Hi. Hi. Come on in. The American Empire|Dismantled. Your father's? '' History Master's|Thesis... Mmm. by Nick|Thornberry.'' You inherited|his passion. But that's all. Tropico, the time has come|for you to pitch in-- your cans, your bottles,|your other recyclables. Hi. I'm Mitch Bennett, president and owner-operator|ofTropico Recycling Company, inviting you all|to come on down and pitch in. Both: Tropico and recycling--|Together, we're on the move. Bennett: Once more,|please, with conviction. And action! Nick and Lissa:|Tropico and recycling-- Together,|we're on the move. Good. Cut. All right, all right.|Now, uh... [Speaking Spanish] Bennett: I want you|to go get Oscar, get that crane|over there... The things we do|for minimum wage. Nick: So can you|help me out? I'm sorry, guy. Once the ad runs,|then we'll talk. Right now,|I can't help you. I'm not asking|for a loan. It's money owed|for services rendered. Hey, listen to me. It's not possible|right now. Look, I know you're|short at the moment, but, hey,|everybody's short. All right. Forget it. Reuben, I thought|I told you not to laugh. What are you doing, huh?|What's wrong with you? Barry: Look, he's my friend.|Let me talk to him. I'm telling you,|I don't care how long|you've known him. Nick. Yeah? Do you know-- Dude, if you|say my name, I'm telling you,|you're out of this. Out of what? Shh. Come on. Shit. Um,|just tell him. Nick, are you|doing anything tonight? Come on. Come on! [La Bamba Playing|Over P.A. System] Bennett's Voice: Welcome|to Tropico Recycling Company. Glass goes to bay 4,|plastics to bay 1 2. Thanks for your business. Barry: OK. The thing is, my friend here,|he works for a pretty big|guy in town. Why don't you|want me to know|your name? Because if you|get busted, how are you going to|identify me? What, he was a black guy|with curly hair? This guy, Nick, is under serious|police investigation right now. He thinks he's going|to get busted anytime. So every night,|he moves his stash from one house|to another so that the cops can't|get a search warrant in time to snatch him. Tonight the stash|is atJimmy's house. You know, you got to have|pond water for brains, man. Oh! I'm sorry. I got a sofa at home|smarter than you. I like saying|people's names. Look,just shut-- Look, man.|It's a real easy job. Barry breaks into my spot when I'm pulling|watchdog duty alone, right? He grabs the stuff|and knocks me out just to make it look good. You're willing|to take that lump? For half of $40,000?|Yeah. It's a two-man|job, Nick, except we need|a driver, OK? Jimmy's first choice got the runs real|bad this morning, so I recommended|you. Now, the way|I'm seeing it is like we give you a fourth|of what we take. I mean, your job's|too easy-- It's really too safe|for anything more than that. Come on, Nick--|as a favor to me. Jimmy: Look, it's|one night's work, man. I mean, the only way|you can possibly fuck up is if you forget to put|gas in the car. Shit. Barry's got two tickets|to the ball game tonight, and he invited me along. You going to go? Yeah, I guess so. Come by, though.|I'll be back around 1 1 :00. OK. Nick: You got to|eat those now? It's a nervous|habit. Game time. Christ,|that was easy. That's it?|You got it? Right here. Want to|drive a little? Ha ha ha! [Coughing] Jimmy's going to have|an Advil binge tomorrow. Oh. Ha ha ha! You're not too bright,|are you, Barry? Nope. Ha ha ha! [Door Opens] Nick: Hi. Hi. I brought you something. Really? Mm-hmm. What? So people|will stop laughing at your music collection. The Space|Between Us? What is this? That's what the kids|are listening to nowadays. Cool, thanks. How was the game? It was fine. You want to know|what the score was? I listened to|a sports radio show so I could lie|factually. You don't have to|tell me where you've been. I will if you ask. I'm thinking|of moving again. Where? Um, Peru. Malta.|Portland, Oregon. I don't know. I hear it's nice|in Portland. Want to come? Please? Well, when were you|planning on going? Um, a couple|of weeks. As soon as|you've finished your masterpiece. Is that a no? It's a yes,|you cocksucker. So? Hey, Barry. Nick here at 30 minutes after|you were supposed to be here reminding you that|the future state of our finances does not excuse us|from our efforts here at work. Hope you're on your way. Can I help you? Get in the car. Right. Bennett's Voice:|Tropico Recycling Company. Glass goes to bay 4,|plastics to bay 1 2. Thanks for your business. Man: That's right.|Nice and easy. We're just going|for a little drive. How you doing? We ain't met. Know who I am? I got a couple|of guesses. I'm the guy you stole|$40,000 from last night. Your suspicion's|correct. I thought you'd be|an older guy. My profession don't|promote career longevity. It's a young man's|business. It don't matter|how I found out. I found out. No matter how sorry|you feel, you're going|to feel sorrier. And it don't matter|how you plan to fix it, because that plan|is obsolete. Freddie, take that shit|off of your head. What for? Take that shit|off of your head and give it to him. Blindfold yourself. Why? Because I don't|know you, and I don't know|who you know. Have you ever read|Adam Smith's An Inquiry into|the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations? Uh-uh. In it, the man addresses the two simple laws|of the market. The first law: self-interest. It is not from the benevolence|of the butcher, the brewer, the fucking baker|that we expect our dinner, but from their self-interest. I don't sell junk|because I feel a civic duty. I do it out of... self-interest. Second law: competition. Only under the check|of competition is a man's self-interest|regulated from ruthlessness. I don't charge|a C-note a pop because I think|some other dude is going to|underprice me. No. I don't overcharge|because what suppresses me? Competition. Consequently,|a man's motivations of... Self-interest... are transmuted by... Competition... to yield social harmony. You, motherfucker,|have fucked with the laws|of the market. You have fucked|with competition. You have deregulated|the self-interest of some other|dope-peddling fuck. You done fucked up|harmony. You must un-fuck it! This is all|simple economics. Jimmy: Fuck. Come on.|Come on. Come on. Jimmy has learned|a lot about economics the last few hours. Keynesian theory,|market trends, all that shit. Taught him the difference|between laissez-faire, which is what|I'm doing right now, and intervention,|which is what I'm about to do. We tried to see|your other associate-- Barry? He was not at home. Neither was most|of his clothes. We surmised he would|not be returning soon, so we came to see you. [Jimmy Groaning] What do you want?|Financial reparation? What do you want? Motherfucker|likes big words. You hold that|thought, though. Got to see|the show first. You rememberJimmy.|Hey, hey, hey, hey. Quit it. All right,|Freddie. Cola. [Muffled Screaming] A little carbonation|up the sinuses will fuck you up good. Freddie: The drink|that refreshes. Now let's deal. I don't have your stash. Then I want|reparation-- $40,000. I don't have that,|either. Oh, I think you do. You're just|being coy. What was your cut? A fourth. we're all square. You don't have it|by Sunday, then you take|the taste test. If you run... this is what your world|will look like. [Tires Screeching] [Nick Dialing Telephone] Bryce: Hey, Nick,|it's Bryce. Guess who's moving|to Tropico-- [Fast-Forwarding Tape] [Beep] Barry: Nick,|it's Barry. Listen, Jimmy isn't answering|his phone. I think things got|fucked up. I'm taking off|for a while till I get ahold|of him. [Beep] Nick: Call the office,|you son of a bitch. Lissa: Things got|fucked up with Jimmy? Yeah. He's some friend|of Barry's-- assistant manager prospect. He was supposed to|show up tomorrow, and the guy's|a complete flake. Nick. I'm in the doghouse. Lissa: I have 1 ,000. No, no. Don't|burden yourself with my fuck-ups. Hey. It's only money. Besides, I've built up|a certain tolerance for your fuck-ups. I think I can|burden myself a little. All right. 1 ,400. We could sell|your car. Another 3,000,|maybe 4,000. That's still|1 0 grand short. My only question is,|why pay them at all? It's just buying us the right to keep|living here, and we're leaving|anyway. I think if I try and run|and they find me, they're going to hurt me. Then don't run. We'll pay them. OK. So, 5 days to raise|$1 0,000. You know what a champ|I am at asking for money. No. No, Nick.|I told you. In a month or so,|we'll discuss this. No. It can't wait. I need an advance today,|or I'm through. Look, I appreciate you|taking Barry's shift, and I'm going to pay you|double-time for it, but that doesn't change|my cash flow. The next words out of|your mouth are ''Yes, Nick,'' or you're|locking up tonight. Don't try to|blackmail me, Nick. Fuck! Aah! Shit. [Beep] Bryce: Nick,|this is Bryce again. I just landed in town. Got a phone number|for you: 5 5 5-01 73. You know, also,|I was wondering, is there a good|mechanic in town? Because my gearshift|just took a crap on me. Give me a call, babe. [Beep] Bryce! Woman On Radio: #There's a new boy|in the neighborhood # # I'd like to meet him|if I could # # He's got the look|that I dream about # # Makes the other girls|scream and shout # Hey. Hey. Welcome|to Tropico. Duck and cover. Nick. Come here, man.|Come here. God, it's great|to see you. You still got|the Charger. That's terrific.|That's terrific. You don't see a lot|of white people driving these nowadays,|but, hey, man, good for you. Come on.|Let's get out of here. Let's go.Jim,|we'll talk to you. Nick: Wow. Bryce: Wait till|you see inside. So we have survey|courses to start-- American lit., Brit. lit., everything that should be|taught in high school. Hawthorne,James,|Fitzgerald. Nick: ''So we beat on,|boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly|with the past.'' F. Scott, Great Gatsby. That's a book he wrote. We don't|actually read anything we teach. The department chair|gives us Cliff Notes at the beginning|of the semester, and we just say|whatever's in those. That's convenient. [Beeping] Can you shut|the door? Thanks. A tad excessive. The guy I'm|house-sitting for-- a tad retentive. Bryce: Can you believe|this place? Mr. Beaumont's a local|guy who made good. He built this house|overlooking Tropico to remind everyone. Visual. Liquid. Jesus Christ. Here we have|the corridor of wonder. The man likes carpet. Even on|the toilet seat for those prolonged|stays of leisure. Oh, and observe|the cabinet of whimsy. Huh. Isn't that great? Oh, that reminds me-- How's your dad? You still live|with him, right? No. He's dead. Jesus. I'm--|I'm sorry. It's OK. It was|a few months ago. Weird. Hey, I've got something|to show you. It's a stay of execution|for a Union deserter during the Battle|of Vicksburg-- Mr. Beaumont's great-|great-somebody-or-other-- but check out the sig. Honest Abe. Didn't|he ever get tired of emancipating|people? Supposedly the stay|was last-minute, and it was the only|paper around. Anyway, I remember you used to dabble|in history, so... I thought|I'd give you a show. You paying them anything|to live here? Rent is nil|on 3 conditions: feed the plants,|keep the place clean, and don't invite|anyone over. I'm making|an exception for you. Bryce McCarthy,|you risk-taker. The starting|professorial salary is shit. I'm really lucky|to have this place. Your parents|have money, right? Their own mint. The last few years,|they've developed this financial|tough-love philosophy on their kids-- sort of|a benign neglect without|the benign part. What, they cut you off? Yup. This life of austerity|is killing me. Ha ha ha! [Dogs Barking] Man: Lincoln,|Lincoln, Lincoln. Signature goes|for about $7 5,000. Do any of these|look familiar? Here. Nick: Um... Yeah. This right here, only these two things|are switched. - That one?|- Yeah. That's a rare item there. Trial printing. Only a few in existence,|and worth about, uh... $200,000. Whoo! So the two together|would be worth... That's a $300,000|stay of execution. Unfortunately, it does|you no good to steal it. Ha! That's speaking|presumptuously. Yeah. Well, you're|asking about it, and it's not yours. Why would it do me no good|to steal it? Most items like those,|they're registered. Hence,|they're immovable. Now, uh... even if this one|happens to be unregistered, you steal it,|owner reports the theft, well, it's|immovable again. What if it wasn't|reported stolen? Why wouldn't it be? I don't know.|What if? You'd have to wait|two months. After 60 days,|no theft report, you can sell|the thing. Of course,|you'd want to muddy the trail of ownership|leading back to you, but that's not hard to do|if you have the right fence. And... what would|the right fence take? Ten percent? Twenty. Ha ha ha! You want me to check and see if there's|a listing on it? Yeah. Yeah. Look around. Nick: It's unregistered,|which means it's fair game. Charlie, the guy who|looked it up for me, he said he'd|advance me 1 5 grand upon receipt|of the stay. Then once he sold it,|he'd send us the rest. You trust him? Yeah. OK. So the trick is|to steal it from a house with an elaborate alarm system and a house-sitter who's not|allowed to invite anyone over without having it reported|stolen for at least two months? And without|getting caught. So how well|do you know Bryce? If you're asking|can we bring him in on it, no, I don't think so. You don't trust him. Our sophomore year|in college, he cheated|on a midterm exam. He got caught,|he confessed, and he gave up the other|two guys, as well. So we got to steal|the thing outright So we got to steal|the thing outright and somehow make sure|Bryce doesn't report it. He's got to believe that he's|going to get in more trouble reporting it than not. How? Make him think|he committed a crime. Murder's the obvious choice. How do you convince somebody|he's a murderer? Other crimes--|arson, burglary, rape. How do you convince him|that he did that? What? Well... You can make it|statutory. You want me|to lay your friend? No! No, of course|I don't. You fuck him, Nick. Liss... And after that,|you know who else you can. Liss, come on! [Door Closes] [Telephone Rings] Answering Machine: This is Nick.|Leave a message. [Beep] Man: Tick-tock,|tick-tock, the mouse ran out the clock,|motherfucker. [Beep] [Truck Drives Off] Ohh! God. Nick? Oh, my God. OK. OK. I'll do it. Oh, Liss. I'm sorry. You fucking bastard. You know what you did. You bastard.|You fucking bastard! You know what you did. You bastard! Nick: Bryce, it's Nick. Yeah. How are you? Good. Good. Listen, what are you|doing tomorrow night? No, I got a place. It's called|the Tropico Nocturne. Nocturne. Wait. Hold on|one second. [Telephone Beeps] Hello. Yeah, this is he. Uh-huh. I'll have the money|Sunday morning. OK. I'll be here. Say no, and we'll just call the whole|thing off right now. Hmm? Once you've given him reasonable cause|for concern... get the hell|out of there. Wait for the cab|outside on the street, not even|on the property. OK. Is that all? Yeah, I think so. I won't see you|until tomorrow night, and I probably won't|come back here afterwards... but I'll call you|as soon as it's over. OK. If that's|what you want, OK. Nick. Are you going to be|OKwith this? I don't know. I guess I have to be.|I want to be. Liss. Yeah. Hi, this is me,|and I'm here, just entertaining some|last-minute reservations. I thought maybe|you'd want to stop by. Calling your|girlfriend already? Hey, have her set me up|with a friend. I could use getting laid.|Hey, bring a friend! [Sirens Passing] Bryce: I got|a joke for you. There's this elephant|in the jungle, and he's got a thorn|caught in his foot. This mouse wanders by. The elephant|stops him and says, ''I'll give you anything if you take the thorn|out of my foot.'' The mouse goes, ''OK,|under one condition. Afterward, I get|to fuck you up the ass.'' And the elephant|nods OK. The mouse takes this|thorn out of his foot. The mouse says, '' Hey,|we had an agreement.'' And the elephant|goes, ''OK.'' So the mouse jumps|on top of his back, he starts|giving the elephant his business, right? And meanwhile,|there's a monkey up above in the trees. The monkey looks down, and he sees this mouse|sodomizing this elephant, and the monkey's|just disgusted. And he's so upset that he grabs a coconut|from the tree, he hurls it|down at them, the coconut hits the|elephant in the head, the elephant|hollers in pain, and the mouse says,|''That's right, baby. Take it all!''|Ha ha ha! No. No. Yes. Yes. I got to go|to the bathroom. Ye of little bladder. Can I set|a running tab, please? Woman: No problem. Get out of here. No. Listen... I love you. Why do you think|I'm doing this? Woman: Thanks, hon. [Giggling] I know, I know. I have|a terrible drinking problem. Whiskey doesn't|stain, does it? I don't think so. Well, it's a hand-me-down|anyway. Brooks Brothers|handed it down to me. You want to sit down? It's only a college buddy|and me. Sure. I'm here|by myself, anyway. I'm Bryce. I'm Kathy. Hi, Kathy. You're back.|Kathy, this is Nick. - Nick: Hi.|- Hi. Is this your seat? Nope. Not anymore. Could I get that|jacket from you? Thanks. Bryce,|I'll see you later. I'm going to go. Is everything OK? Yeah. I'm just|a little preoccupied. No kidding. It's been discovered|that our friend here is on a very short leash. Nick: I took care|of that tab. - Will you at least tip?|- Mm-hmm. OK. I'll call you tomorrow.|Nice to meet you, Kathy. Nick: I'm sorry. Bryce: Nick! There's nothing|to apologize about. It's OK. See you, Nick.|See you, buddy. [Moaning] We're fucked. You're telling me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I never meant this to happen.|I promise you. I promise. You didn't|get the key? Where is it? Bryce has it. The note? No, the key.|I have the note. No. It's not|in your purse. I didn't put it|in my purse. I have it. What happened? He just laid there|for a while afterwards. This is after you... What then? Then I started|into my speech, but he just went|fucking ballistic, and I tried to go|for the door... He didn't do anything|to you, did he? He dragged me down|the stairs, Nick. I know. I'm sorry.|I'm sorry. He's just|a bad drunk is all. I must look terrific|about now. No, you... You wear captivity well. So where is it? The note.|Where is it? Really? You could at least kiss|me when you do that. Baby. Thanks. That was|really sweet. [Thumping From Upstairs] ...Lord today? Have you? Have you thought|about the Lord lately? I'm glad|you're here. I'm glad, too. It doesn't mean we have|to stick around, though. I know. So, what are we|going to do? Well, I have two ideas. First one, I break that pole,|you slide your arms out, and we go home. I like that idea. Do we get the money? I don't know. He's been upstairs studying your I.D.s|for the past two hours. Does he know|they're both fake? Not yet. What's idea two? Bryce: What'd she say?! '' My uncle is|a fucking lawyer. He's going to|have your ass. He's going to|tear the scrotums off you|cocksuckers, you--'' Jesus! That's it, Nick. She's not|going to drop it? What was that|one line? Uh... '' Both of you are going to rot|in jail the rest of your lives. Going to be mayors|of ass-rape city.'' [Gagging] Nick: You might want|to lift the lid there. [Vomiting] Jesus, Nick. Jesus, this shitty|little girl. You work your whole life,|and one goddamn night, you-- write a doctoral thesis|on Middle English, Middle-- [Vomiting] Middle fucking English! To get fucked by some|prom queen in training. I came once!|I can't even remember. So you don't get tenure.|So what? Well, fuck tenure.|I'm unhirable. I can't even|get a janitor's job. I might as well|do what you do. It's all I ever wanted|to do, Nick, was teach. It's all I know|how to do, and now I can't because|Miss Bitch-City downstairs won't let me. I'm so fucked. We are. What? Aiding and abetting,|Bryce. Kidnapping. She's bringing that|against me, too? Us, Bryce! Us. Wicked fucking|bitch. Bitch! Here. Come here. Wait! You done? [Flushes Toilet] Hey... I screwed it.|I'm sorry. She's whacked. I know. There's no way you could reason|with someone like that. God, I'd like|to kill the girl. She showed up at the bar|alone, right? Yeah, I think. Didn't seem like|she knew anybody there, and nobody would remember you|two leaving together, right? No, the bartender|saw her kiss me. I mean, why? What|are you suggesting? Television: Tropico, the time|has come for you to pitch in. Bryce. Hey, are you in this? It has the production|value of bad porn. Bryce, you prick. What? Why'd you call me? Why did I call you? Yeah. Huh? I called you|because I needed help. You're a sly one, man. You're a fucking|sly one! I'm not trying|to be sly. Talk to me. I needed your advice! Then stop fucking|patronizing me! I know what you're doing! Tropico Recycling.|Together... What? You have been playing me|for the fool all night, ever since I walked in|that door. ''What are you|suggesting, Nick?'' Oh, you are sweet. If you want to kill her,|then say so, but don't|play games with me. Kill her? It's why I got the call-- to give you the nerve.|It's out in the open now. Don't pussyfoot around. I-- I...|Kill her? Yes, Bryce. I couldn't do that. You couldn't. Well, we couldn't. I can't believe that|you're even saying this. I mean, actually kill her?|Take her life? No, the other sense|of the word ''kill.'' What are you doing? I'm looking|for a pillow. What for? There. Have yourself a time. This is not|why I called you. Why else? You were|looking for an alternative to letting her go? What other alternative|did you think I'd suggest? Consciously or not,|this is what you want. This is why|you called me. Can we really do this? Come here. Sit. Can we do this?|Yes, I think we can. No one can associate you|with the girl. There are no witnesses|to your meeting except me, and I'm your alibi|for the entire evening. No, no. I mean,|can we really... I mean,|she's-- she's-- She's a person, I know,|with an actual life, and we're talking|about ending it. You're right. That's...|That's pretty horrible. But remember, we're talking|about 3 lives here-- hers and both of ours. I just want to do|what's right. I do, too. And this is a moral issue,|but it's also a practical one. The greatest good for|the greatest number of people. It's a tough one, granted. We save her, we screw us,|and vice versa, But think--|Who's worth saving here? Who's created this problem? Someone is going to|get hurt, Bryce. It's just|a question of who. Anyway. It's your decision to make.|I'll stand by whatever you say. OK. I guess I'll do it. No, no, no. I'll do it. You sure? That's why you called. What's that? It's what|it looks like. She gave you that? It's weird|because I remember her being really into it,|screaming like a champ. I must have been|doing something right. I need the key|now, Bryce. What? Handcuffs. Oh. [Exhales] I'll be back|in a couple minutes. What now? You die. Oh, God. Huh! All right. [Alarm Ringing] Oh! Sorry. [Alarm Stops] You need a hand? No. I got her. Shit. I forgot|her purse. Just hang in there|a little longer. I'll have you out|in two seconds. I don't know if I want|to go through with this. It's just a little longer.|Just hang in there, OK? Nick, please. Bryce:|What are you doing? What do you mean? No, you're not|coming with me. Yeah, I am. No. I don't want you.|I can't use you. What are you|going to do? There's an incinerator|at the recycling plant. I'm going to|put her in it. Is that safe? Nobody arrives|at work till 9:00, now get out.|Come on. Wait!|What about her car? All right,|what about it?! If they report her missing,|the police will track the car. When they find it, they'll|ask around the Nocturne. OK, fine.|I'll move it. You'll need the keys. You have them? Look, I can't|stay here alone! I just can't stay here. I-- I need to eat|something. OK. I'll drop you off|to eat. Then I'll deal|with the girl... and then I'll deal|with her car. OK? OK. OK. [Starts Engine] Isn't there a minimum|speed limit or something? Man On Radio:|# Glow worm, glimmer, glimmer # # Lead us, lest too far|we wander # # Love's sweet voice|is callin' yonder # # Shine, little glow worm|glimmer, glimmer, hey # #And don't get|dimmer, dimmer # # Light the path|below, above # #And lead us on|to love # Ha ha ha! What? This song. What about it? It's all about sperm. No, it's not. Oh, come on. '' Light the path that|leads us on to love''? This little glow worm is like|Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Sperm, leading|all the other sperm up. Of course it is. [Turns Off Radio] You know, not|everything in the world revolves around fucking. No,just most things. No, they don't. They revolve around|money and power and sometimes spite. You know what?|That's history's view. Literature's view is|it's all about fucking. [Siren] Oh, shit. Nick, turn around. Nick! Goddamn it, Bryce,|calm the fuck down! Shit, Nick.|Nick, turn around! Calm down.|Calm down. Slow down!|Slow down! All right, we got a car|coming through! Clear a lane there!|Clear a lane! [Men Shouting] Keep moving there.|Keep moving. Let's get some hands|over here! Pull around|to the left there. You guys, over here. Get that hose|straightened. Bryce: Nick? Nick, there's|a car following us. Nick: Keep it up,|Bryce. Drunk and paranoid|looks good on you. Shit! I think|it's a cop, Nick. They're going to stop us.|What if they stop us? What if they check|the trunk? Shut the fuck up! See?|It's not a cop. Nick? Man: Time's up,|motherfucker! Aah! Aah! Get out|of the fucking car! Bryce: Please!|Please! Please! No! No! No!|No! No! No! Don't hit--|Don't hit-- Don't hit me! Don't hit me!|Don't hit me! [Engine Revving] You fuck! I'll fucking kill you,|you son of a bitch! Ugh! Nick! Nick! What are we|going to do now? They just took the car!|They're going to find her! Lissa, Lissa, Lissa,|Lissa, Lissa, Lissa... Nick! Nick, what are we|going to do? Quiet! Nick, they're going to-- They're going to|call the police. Bryce,|they're car thieves. They're not going to|call the police. Nick, get up! Come on. Nick, get up. Nick. Nick, what-- I'll take care of it. Just go home, OK?|Just go home. But-- Just--Just... [Telephone Rings] [Ring] Nick, Answering Machine:|This is Nick. Leave a message. I'm here.|I'm here. I'm here. [Beep] Hello? Man: We got|something of yours. Got two things|of yours, actually. What do you|want me to do? Stop checking your ass|out in the mirror. You coming? Man: Boy, you got|a funny idea about chivalry. When me and my lady|go driving, she always rides|up front with me. I thought our date|was Sunday. It was.|I bumped it up. Thought you might be getting|a little flighty. Apparently you've been|getting something. What the fuck|you been up to? Where is she? Man: Don't worry. We ain't offered her|any soda. a very curious economic|system in this country. There was|a civil war. Yeah. I read|about it. But before that, my great-great-great-|grandmother was put up for auction. Set a female record|in Georgia-- $800. Now, given inflation|with today's dollars, she was sold|for approximately... Is that|your asking price? Mm-hmm. That will be a total|of $25,000 you owe me. I can get you 20|in 3 or 4 hours, if you can wait|that long. Freddie will|drive you back. Your girlfriend|will stay here... while you go get|your daddy's money. Wait a minute. How did you know|about my dad? [Crack] Hey! Hey! Hey! Man: Hey! Hey. Man: Oh... fuck! Nick. Ha ha! It's just... you know... What did we steal? Baking flour. We thought you got|all that money from your dad,|you know, and the house. Ha ha! What's 20 grand? I mean, come on. We didn't expect you|to pull all this shit. What's your story? I'm a finance major. We all got|tuitions to pay. Uh... I'm just|his cousin, man. Man:|By marriage. Ha ha ha! [Moaning] Aah! You fuck! [Glass Shattering] [All Shouting At Once] Come on, man!|Calm down, man! Get up off of me! What the hell is wrong|with you, man? Calm down! Man: Come on, man.|Let's get him out of here. Come on, let's go. What, you never fucked|a friend before? No-- No hard|feelings, man. Hey, sorry about|your car, dude. Uh, you can call the police|if you want, but you know,|you do that, we'll start mentioning|the chick in the trunk. Man: #Take me back # We'll try and get|your wheels back. #To where you hide # # Lay me down # # Lay me down inside # # Lay me down inside # Excuse me. Do you know|what time it is? We got to be at Charlie's|in two hours. But, Nick, why? It's the most fucked-up|night of my pathetic life. [Car Horns Honking] Lissa! Liss! Liss! Wait! Look,|I'm sorry! I'm sorry I put you|through all this! Don't apologize|to me, Nick. Don't. That only makes this|whole situation worse. You were in a hole, and I did what|I needed to do. But we can still|salvage some of this. We can still|get the money. The money, Nick? Bryce has no idea you're|still alive. We could-- What,just|fuck him over? Just fuck him over|for the hell of it? This was never|about money, Nick. This was about you|being stuck in the same place|for your whole life. Shit. You two together? I'm not sure. [Toilet Flushing] Nick! Jesus, you're here. Bryce. What's going on?|Did you find the car? What are you|doing here? I was starved. This was|the only place open. I told you|to go home. Yeah, I know,|but, um... Nick, I don't think|I can handle this. I've got this|sick feeling inside. It's like a tightness|in my chest, and I feel like it's|kind of going to burst. You killed her, Nick. Excuse me? You killed her.|You smothered her. I mean,|she was a person. Now she's just dead. Lissa: Yeah,|can I get a cab? OK? And I can't|handle it. I mean, I just can't|go through with it. I got to talk|to somebody. Yeah? Ha ha! Of course you do. I'm sorry, Nick.|I got to-- I'm going|to the police. For me. I have to. You know|something, Bryce? You're an asshole. In fact, you've always|been an asshole, even in college. I think that's why|I never really liked you. Nick, I'm having a crisis|of conscience here. There's no need|to be rude. Oh. What the fuck|is this? What the fuck|is that? Lissa, wait. What? Lissa? Christ, she's not-- What-- What the fuck|is going on? Bryce, this is Lissa. She's my girlfriend. Was my girlfriend. What happened? I mean,|I thought she was in-- She slept with you... to steal that... to save my life. And if she leaves me now, I'm never going to be able|to make it up to her, and I badly need|to make it up to her. [Door Closes] Bryce: I never|liked you, either! Wow. Cabdriver: What's it|going to be-- in or out? I thought|you were leaving. I thought I was, too. Then I realized|I didn't have any money. Ha ha ha! Let's walk? Where? Anywhere... away from here.
