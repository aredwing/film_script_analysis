The multi-verse. Which is? Parallel worlds. I don't understand. Well, according to quantum theory of Hugh Everett III, everything might happen, surely happens on one of the branches of reality.

That's right bro... ...it's exactly like I said. Dr. Piotrowski says exactly the same thing as me. Told you so many times. Constantly, day and night. Yeah bro, vitamins. You have a deficiency. And you're weakened. Told you to eat more vitamins. To use my example? A kilogram of apples a day. And no issues. You do not eat vitamins and you are weakened. You are so weakened that you are weak and pass out. Luckily, Dr Piotrowski said they can give you those vitamins by an I.V. You will stay here a while and be good as new. Don't make a scene. I'll be back in the morning. Bring you apples from all the orchards in the world. Later bro. You coming? Where have you lost Tom, Mr. Jack? Sell him off to "I Got Talent?"

Time to say goodbye bro. I know. I don't want it to hurt. I know. We want to try chemo still. Gotta believe in miracles. Don't bullshit me bro. Tom... This is so fucked up. You speak only when you fucking want to?! Magda! What's up? What's going on... with you? You know... you can always call me. You can always talk with me. Not like with a policeman like with a friend, see? Can I tell you something? Like to a friend? Not a policeman? Sure. I'm going far away soon. But I'll write. Later then. Good morning Mrs. Kwiatkowska. Is Tom here? Oh, fuck... like 30 minutes ago, his buddies took him out for a beer. Joke. Bro, you have no idea who's here. Sir, my friend is visiting from New Zealand. I'd like to show him the view from the rooftop. That's not possible. I'll pay two thou. That is sick what you are trying to tell me. So go back to your joints now and never come here again. I'm here.
