Epilepsy. because of this you quit study for a year? - I'm painful, Hanna. - Have you seen doctors? oh, forget it, you know how many docs I've been checked? at last none of them know how to heal me. the final diagnose result. they tried some ways then, they gave you some pills and then... have new side effect. must use new ones to control it. maybe you should accept this reality. you are sick, Michaela! your life is in danger! no excuse to keep it in closet. - but i feel so ashamed. - but you'd have told me first. swear to me, you won't let others know. if my parents find out, I will faint. that's over. if you want me to keep this secret. all right, you promise me to see the doc. Michaela? why you are here? unbelievable. you have time? mint? no speaking? you must think I'm crazy, but I don't know who else can understand me. if you need my understanding, you should talk. in St. Carlo... I...woke up at night. then...I couldn't catch that necklace. I tried hard to get it, but there always some strength pulled me backward, just like... ...I was not myself. then, it happened again. this morning. appeared with ghosts' faces and sounds, screams I was shiting on them. you don't know what I have experienced! they came out all of a sudden, then spread everywhere... I... wanna close my eyes or, hide somewhere, but it's no use. - they kept yelling. - what they yelled out? that you shit on them? or you can't get the necklace? - please don't. - you bring it here? - it's a souvenir of a store. - why won't you believe me? you hear what you are talking about? ghost face, sounds. what are you talking about? devils? we sure believe there are devils on earth. but we believe in God too. it's just a metaphor, we should keep to them. but you can't keep to each word. - but, Father... - ah, so terrible. illusion! you should talk to your psychologist. you are so angry, because you are afraid too. you know I won't lie to you. and I can't imagin all of this. you just begin your study, birds just fly out of the nest. what's wrong with you? watch out your own way! how this way looks like? where it'll lead me to? I thought you could help me. many things happened recently. I don't know... you need more time? I feel special during the first weeks when I left home. I understand. Stefan. - promise, you'll be with me. - sure. kiss me. - you wanna write it down? - don't be. - don't. clinch, you can try with Stefan. - do we need to study? - today is almost passed. I won't pursue those. - I'll read about one more semester. - how could you know you can do this? from logic, I could. this one, you don't need to read. but you might learn something in highscool. it's Holy Katharina. - she's only 33. - so what? Hanna, when she was as old as you, have done many good things I think, it's not because she is a sister. she came from a poor place with her illed body but she stopped a war, - when she was 33. - oh, here it writes, she wrote the god's decision. she fought against devils... ...and released the life when she died. bla, bla, bla. You don't want to understand me, do you? I have missed for a year. Hanna, the time, that you possess of is a gift. all right, it's the time for next date. you need come to have x ray next Tuesday. feel cold? please close your eyes. Michaela! we are in the town. I wonder if we could meet ah, so coincident. I'm thinking of the story you told me. I told it to the Father Borchert. he is the parochial assistant Father. how are you? - your not believing me hurts me so much. - I just wanna help you, When I said you should see doctor. so, satisfied? dated with doc three times, enough? you also wanna tell me that I'm a psycho? I think, everyone should have a soulmate. - Father Landauer wouldn't make people feel like that. - I'm familar with your parish yes, I remember you are a good missionary once I should give a cow a peace. so, you did it? it's Gerhards' job. kind of simple belief. in hard time, God is like an insurance company. - good havest, means this company is good. - yes, people would think of that. I ask myself. does it mean God's exist if there's a good havest? or someone is illed? people must distinguish which are real pains which are mess in mind, and superstition. what I suffered are all real. so did the necklace. I don't know, if the new pills would work. sometimes I got this feeling. we try to use science to explain the nature. these things don't need explaination. if someone is really painful what science should do? don't we pray for the God to help us? yes, I'm not understand of this. I can only say... - What I felt, What I experienced. - yes, why, I wanna listen? how about things happen to you, Michaela? because it maybe so crazy for my illness. the world make our souls sick. I almost doubt about it. you know, I don't wanna ask more. I wanna stay her, have my life. but sometimes, I feel I can't stop, then... my belief gave me so much power. you also have you belief. this belief is more powerful than the dark things - but I'm scraed - hands of God are strong enough, to protect us. while praying, he's by our sides. - right. let's pray? Holy Spirit, come into my heart. short our distance with your power. give me the kindness and fearness of God. Christ, protect me from hurt warm me with your love. make me get rid of the burden. help me fullfill all my tasks. beloved Christ, beloved Christ, Amen. so someone insane, is just like this. stop it. these are your pills, so small? they said, each pill everyday no paroxysm for a year. "Grandmaux Epilepsie" sounds like french cheese,right? shut up I think what you wrote is hard to recognise. well, I think it's good, so great! - all right, if you think it's ok, it's enough to the teacher. - that's right. and one title, called: grasp the fate. - I'm applying the internship in Hamburg. - how it's going? - They hire me! - no way! - it's true. in a kindergarten, leading them to travel. setting out after Christmas. - what? so fast. - ah, only four weeks, it's short. besides you got yours to be with you. where is he? ha, maybe he still his mother's babe. - oh, do I enter the wrong door? - no, you don't... - oh, why are you here? - you've been so long not contacting to me. - celebrating what? - oh, Michaela is tutoring my works. - Hanna. - yes - Hello - I know your father. - I'm leaving, bye. - bye, Hanna, see you later. come on in. you lost weight. maybe grew a little taller. I didn't tell your mama I came here. now she must be disburdened There, came at the beginning of the week. you use my medicare... God, Michaela, it said... but it's not suprising, no matter what, I need a doctor too in Tubingen. but it's not the same thing. it's worse than that. it said... ...you should visit a psychiatrist, to heal your pyschological illness. please don't be like that. - you got pyschological problem? - no, not yet. Michaela, please understand me. you stayed in hospital for years because of Epilepsy - what else could I think? - so, what do you think of? I saw, you turned better, but... do you remember, you have said, when you go to see the doc, you will lost. - we're all in the hands of God, Papa. - yes, my child. it's nice that you are here. Merry Christmas. ah, moreover for the student who wanna be teachers. there's a tiny homework to do. hang on before 15th Jan. you will know, while others are celebrating, the feelings that you are still working. make some effort. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - bye. - bye. you already come there - Michaela! - hello. ah, be careful, you make yourself dirty. look. you think it's fit for you? meal is ready, pack your luggage. this is from me.

Are you still normal? put them where they should be. - why you are doing this? - get your clothes on. - in the garbage can! - you are a thief. you'd better remember it. - do I have anything to do with it? - don't be like an orphen stroll around. are you all crazy? let's go! - Have you ever thought what I want? - be rational! how long we left? (anthem) a rose. growing from the earth. just like us singing. Christ was born... with a little flower. Michaela! let me... no... let me go! merciful goddess.... Michaela! - papa! - Michaela! my God! child! - get the pills! - I can not pray anymore. I can not pray anymore. - hello. - Michaela! - really sorry. bother you just one day after Christmas. - come on in. it's so quiet here. just like the chapel last night - but I pray for you. - seemed useless. what I did is not important. I did wrong. I try my best ... to pray. I try my best to be a good student. but they always exceeded me. I almost broke my mother's necklace. little by little I understand the pain that Holy Katharina metioned is like in the hell... Holy Katharina, yeah, she must experienced many tests. but as far as died, she connected to the God closely. because of the pain she endured maks her to be the one God selected. may be god forgot me, I mean nothing to him. he burden the cross for us. he burden the pain and sacrifice for each. you are no exception. but now, the devil is powerful. I try hard, to conquer it. but why me? I did nothing. I go to the university. wanna my life in perfect order. - but God send the devil to me! - that's because you are special. you are sensitive to this crazy world. let's pray. last time you did well. no, I don't wanna pray! praying is no use. when I wanna pray, you came. I've experienced this. why God can't bring me luck? Am I punished? God doesn't punish he is trying out those of his favorites Michaela. you knew it. I can only think it as a God's test otherwise we will be desperate. you can only sit in this unenlightened devious place, spread yourself. then complain that God is so far away from us. this world is falling if your praying is useful. why you just sit and complain? why you do nothing about this?! bye. you at least let me know who is this? why you bring us here the first day of new year? - stop, papa. - what else you ask for us? - can we let you go back to school? - I forgot to take the pill. I won't do this. I have no power. do you know, how hard to fully support you? you mama sank me into the hell. she is angry everytime. she knew what God did to you. drive. please. - bye, my darling. - bye - you take care of yourself - ok - bye - bye oh,my God. Hanna? Hanna - my father was drunk again. - can I look? - I wanna beer now. - ah, nonsense. furthermore, it's Christmas stores are all closed. Hallelujah I'm so happy, it's all passed away. take the train tomorrow morning. 8 hours late, I will be in Hamburg. I should have forgotten these stuff. can you put off to go? you also said, I should grasp my fate. I can't tell myself what's hell the life means. I hear some voice, Hanna. What? you can't imagine. I can't control anymore. I have a feeling. everything got in my hands will disappear. take away my last energy. - Michaela, what are you talking about? - you can't go now. I don't know what'll happen next. I'm so scared. you shouldn't drink so much. Michaela, maybe you should visit your psychologist. Michaela, wait! God, you can't leave me along with those crap. I need go to Hamburg! I believ what you said, but you must believe me... don't say that. go to Hamburg with your theory as a psychologist. how you are coming! so suprised! I miss you. - you drunk. - don't bother. come on. come on. I have to go. let's stay for a while, we could drive out. when new semester starts, we both have no time.

I speak, you type, ok? - if you can't go on your thesis maybe abandon next semester. - no. - it's normal in university. - have nothing to do with this. come on, I'm ready, ok? we'd better start from beginning. "improve the education of orphanage with direct vivid ways. End home careness, comma. marriage, motherhood comma, help comma. must need..." show me. was I wrong? nothing wrong, you did all great who can get the high score? if I knew early, I chose education too.

I can't. I go back. - Michaela - ah... - Michaela, we have talked. - yes. we have different opinion and attitude. maybe we should chat in your room it's better. why? we could talk here.
