I have your money! What do you think I'm doing in New York? I-I swear to you I came here to settle up with you. Fuck. Please, man, just talk to me. Can you hear me? Okay. All right, just calm down and just breathe. Breathe. - Help, please. Is anybody there? Please help me. Is anybody out there? Somebody, anybody. - I can hear you. Can you hear me? - What the hell is this? I'm trapped. I can't move. I don't know who's doing this, so- I don't know who you are. Look, if anybody can hear me, I don't know how long I've been here or where I am. I just want to get out. - Something's here. Hold on. - I didn't do anything! Help me, please! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Please, somebody, anybody, please. - Hello, can you hear me? - Yes! Yes, yes, I can hear you. I can- - Who is this? - Who are you? I mean, why are you doing this to me? What do you want? I haven't- - All right, take it easy. Tell me your name. - Henry. Henry Shaw. Who the hell is this? - Okay, Henry. You have any idea where you are? - No, I have no idea. It's dark. I can't see a thing. I can't sit up. There's barely enough room to move around. I can't breathe, okay? I'm having trouble breathing. And I hurt my hand trying to get out. I think I might have broken it. - Are the walls smooth? - Yeah, they're slick like glass, okay? And there are these numbers. Please stop asking me all these questions. Just let me out of- - Are they counting down? - Yes, they're counting down. What does it mean? Am I gonna die? - Just- - Is this some kind of a- - Stop. Just read me your numbers. - Okay, fine, fine. 2:22, 2:21, 2:20. Oh, Jesus Christ, is this it? You gotta get me out of here! - I wish I could, pal. Looks like me and you are in the same boat. - What? You're trapped too? What-what is this? - Pitch black. Tight space, numbers, yeah. - We're gonna die, aren't we? 'Cause the numbers are still going down. - Don't think about that now, all right? You need to try and relax. I'm gonna get you out of there. - Relax? What, are you kidding me? You're trapped too. How the hell are you gonna help me? - I need information to help us both. Talk to me, Henry. Are you a gambler? - Um, I don't know. Yeah, a little sometimes, maybe Atlantic City. I play some keno. What does that have to do with anything? - Keno, huh? At least lose your shirt on a real man's game, Jesus. - Oh, okay, I'm sorry. What's a real man's game? - Cards, Henry. A real man screws up playing cards. - And that's what you think this is about? A gambling debt? Listen, I don't know what kind of trouble you're in, but I don't owe anyone anything, okay? - Do you Know a man named Dietrich Morgan? - Who? No, no, no, look. I'm done playing 20 Questions. We're running out of time here. This is bullsh- - Come on, man, the name. Dietrich Morgan. You ever heard that name before? Just think hard, okay? This is important. - No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't know anyone by that name. I'm positive. Listen, you've got to figure this out, okay? I don't know how much longer I can last in here. Do you hear me? - Just try and relax, Henry. This radio's old, man. It's ancient. This frequency can't travel very far. We've got to be close together. - okay. Okay, so then why is this happening? - Shh. Hold on. I think I hear something. - What is it? What do you hear? - Shut up! Hello! Help, somebody! Anybody, if you can hear me, I'm trapped! Okay. I'm going to figure this out. clank! - Okay, good. Let's go. - Oh, shit. What the f... Oh, what the... Henry? Henry, what's going on in there? - I'm moving. What the hell? - Are you in the trunk of a car? 'Cause I am. - Yeah, yeah, I think so. I'm in a car too. Oh, man, this can't be happening. Please, this can't be- - Listen to me, okay? You remember anything? You remember anything about where you were before you woke up? - I was in New York, Manhattan. I was at the Clarion Hotel on Park Avenue. Is that where you were? Were-were you in New York? - I can't tell you that right now. Okay, whoever's doing this to me wants us communicating. I gotta watch what I say, and I can't explain it to you. But I need to know what you were doing in New York. - It was a business trip. - Okay, that's great. I get that. What kind of business? Are you a broker, real estate, lawyer? - Just business. - All right, stop stonewalling me, man. We're on the same team here. Fuck! - Okay, listen, I work for the State Department. I'm a foreign service officer assigned to the NSC in the White House ops center. - Fuck. Henry- Ah, fuck. Slow it down, asshole! Henry. Henry, are you stopped? - Yes. - Okay, turn the radio off for ten seconds. Yell as loud as you can. I want to see if I can hear you. - That's a good idea. Okay, here goes. - Come on. Did you yell? - Yeah. You didn't hear me? Did you hear me? Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, what is this? Lights just turned on. It's a box. I'm in a goddamn plastic box! It's so bright. I can see wires and tubes. There's no way out of here. What is this? - Somebody fucking with us, that's what this is. - Why? - That's what I'm gonna find out. Hold on. Oh, you gotta be kidding me! Thanks a lot. What the fuck? Oh, Jesus. - Jeremy. Jeremy? Jeremy. - How do you Know my name? I never gave you my name. - I just got a piece of paper, and it says, "The man in the other car has the answer to a question." It says your name is Jeremy. - Listen, Henry. I can't answer that question. - You can't or you won't? - It doesn't matter. I can't say anything. - No, Jeremy, please. If it will get us out of here, I need you to tell them. Please? I have a family, Jeremy- a wife, two kids. Please, just- I want this to be over. - How do I know you're not the one who put me in here, huh? How do I Know you're not the one driving the fucking car? - If I was driving the car, you'd hear me, wouldn't you? I didn't put you in there, and I'm not driving the car. Look, I'm stuck in a trunk too, remember? I'm not the bad guy here, Jeremy. - I'm sorry. I can't trust anyone or anything right now. - Jeremy, you have to bel- click! - What the hell is going on? This wire goes here. Tube goes through there. Oh, Jesus. Is this shit for real? Damn. Okay, you want to fuck with me? Channel 19. Let's give this a try. Hello. Hello. Can anybody hear me? Can anybody read me on this frequency? If anyone can hear me, please, please help me. Come on. - Hey, you okay, there? Who am I talkin' to? - You can hear me. - Barely. You're kinda breakin' up. The name's Bob. Who's this? - It's Jeremy. Uh, my name's Jeremy. - You sound a little agitated, son. What seems to be the problem? - Look, this is gonna sound nuts, all right? Somebody locked me in the trunk of a car. I think I'm close to you, 'cause you can read my signal. - Okay, hang on a second. I've heard some crazy shit before, but do you want to run that by me again? - I'm being held captive in the trunk of a car, all right? I'm serious, man. I need some help here. Please, where are you? - Southbound in a big rig on the I-95. - I-95, okay, all right. All right, well, I'm in a car, moving. We must be heading in the same direction. - You have any clue what kind of car? - I don't. I don't Know. I woke up in here. - Have you been drinkin'? Because if this is a joke, it's not funny. - No! Listen to me. This is not a joke. I swear on my life I'm in real trouble here. - okay, okay, what do you need me to do? - Okay, I need you to blast your horn three times. That's it. I need to know how close you are to me. - Okay, all right. Here goes. - Okay. I can hear you, man! Fuck, yes. I hear you, all right? Sounds like you're behind me. You need to speed up and catch up. - Copy that. Movin' out of the slow lane now, headin' your way. - Yes! Okay, all right. What kind of cars are in front of you? I'm in something with a large trunk, a big-cylinder engine. You gotta get down the plates. You gotta write down the plates, please. - I'm drivin' a truck, son. I can't write down shit. - Okay, well, what are you seeing? What's on the road? - Directly in front of me a ways up, I got a red Hyundai. Let's see, a green Saab. - No, no. Wait a minute. I hear something. I hear a Harley, man. I hear a bike right on top of us. You see anything like that? - Yeah, yeah. There it is. About 100 yards ahead. - Get to that bike! That's us, man! Come on, hurry up! Speed the fuck up, please! Sounds like we're taking an exit, man. They're trying to lose you. Please. - I'm trying, kid. I'm trying! Can you hear me? Hello? - Hello? Bob, what's happening? Are you getting closer? - Hello? - Bob? - Are you there? - Oh, come on. Please hear me, man. Bob? Bob! You're stopping now? - Hello? - Hello? - Jeremy? Is that you? - Molly? Molly! - Ooh, you've got to be kidding me. Now you call me? I-I don't have time for this. - Molly. - I'm gonna be late for work. I'm hanging up. Good-bye, Jeremy. - No, no, no! No, no, don't hang up, please. Look, I'm in the trunk of a car, okay? I'm-I'm trapped. I'm in a box. I need your help. - Why am I not surprised the first time we talk in three months, you drunk-dial me? - No, I'm not-I'm not drunk. I swear to you, okay? Somebody dialed your number. I'm in this fucking box. You're on a speakerphone, okay? - Why do I keep getting caught up in your shit, Jeremy? This is right where we left off. The gambling, Morgan- - No, this is not Morgan. Trust me; he would not go this far. Look, listen to me, please. You remember the number? Remember the number I gave you in case of an emergency? - What-what number? Ben's cell number? - Yes. Yes. You need to find it, babe. You need to find it. - Okay, wha-I don't know what I'm looking for. What-what does it start with? - I don't Know the number by heart. It was-it's programmed into my phone. - Where is your phone? Jeremy, what's going on? - That's what I'm trying to figure out, okay? Here's the deal. Find the number. Call Ben, please. Tell him what's happened to me, and then tell him they need to secure POTUS. In those words exactly. Can you do that for me, please? - Yeah, yeah. Okay, where is it? - Uh, my computer. The desk. The top drawer, in a folder. - I emptied the desk drawers when you moved out. I-I don't know, Jeremy. - Look, I don't Know how much time I have. Please just find the number. - okay. - Molly, did you get it? - Uh... - Molly? Molly, where are you? Come on, babe. - There's-there's someone at my window. - What? What? Oh, no. No, please. Oh, fuck, no. No! Molly? Molly! No! Hey! Let me out of here! You'd better not fucking touch her! You got to fucking calm down. - Do we have your attention now? This can all be over very quickly. - Fuck you. - Or we can just leave you in there. - Okay. Yeah, I'm here. You want to talk? I'm listening. - Tell us what we want to know. - So are you the guy sending me postcards? - You know what we want. - Yeah, I may Know what you want, yeah, sure. I can't really think in here. I can't even breathe. I got an idea. Why don't we pull over and we make a deal? You want information. And I want out of here, okay? So let's pull over and deal. You're not in control of this situation. I am. Now, tell us what we want to know, or Molly suffers for your lack of cooperation. - No, no, no. No, listen to me, okay? You don't want to do this, all right? You want to stop right now, and I'll forget the whole thing. - I want the location of Roulette! - Look, just pull over the car, and I'll talk to you, all right? I said let's communicate! Please! Hello? Hel- Fuck. Oh, fuck. All right, all right. Okay. Jesus Christ. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Help! Stop, please! Somebody help me! Help, somebody! - Jeremy, are you okay? - Henry! They put bees in my trunk, man. - I know; they told me what they were going to do. They said that I'm next. - I need help. I'm going to go into anaphylactic shock. I'm allergic. If I don't get a shot soon, man, I'm done. - Jeremy, I can help. I think I know the answer to the question they asked you. - What are you talking about? You don't Know anything. - They have my wife, Jeremy. They have my kids! - Give them nothing. There's nothing to give. There's not- What the fuck? - 38-45. 3-8-4-5, 14. - Center, 98. - 98, Center. Go ahead. - Center recon, tag the RP, and ascertain that she still has a visual on the suspects. Area check north and south ends of the alley at this time. - 10-4, 98. Stand by. - Center, 98. Disregard. We have a visual. 2945, male, southbound from the alley on foot. - Hey! Hey, man, let go. Let go of my arm! Fuck! You f-what is this? - You should say thank you. - What? - We saved your life. You're welcome. - Why give me the shot, huh? Why keep me alive? Why all of this? - Agent Reins. Special Agent Jeremy Reins. Current assignment: the national security advisor's protection detail. Nice job. - I don't Know who you're talking about, man. - Don't play dumb. We Know who you are. We Know who you work for. We couldn't afford to lose you. You're a valuable asset, Jeremy. Well, if you Know me so well, then you Know I'm not going to tell you anything. - No, Agent Reins. You will give us the location of Roulette. How much you suffer before that is ultimately up to you. - Look, man, I can't help you, all right? I don't know what you're talking about. You want to play roulette, you go to Vegas, right? Try Atlantic City if you don't like to fly. I don't Know what to tell you. - I'm glad you still have your sense of humor. But I'm on a schedule, Agent Reins, and very soon, my patience will run out. - God damn it. Oh, God. Ah, fuck. Henry, are you still with me? - Jeremy, is that you? I thought you were gone. - No. No, still here. They gave me a shot. They saved my life. - Why would they do that? I don't understand. - Look, if we're going to find out what's going on here, I need to Know everything you Know. - All I know is, this has something to do with Roulette. - What do you Know about that? - I know it's an underground bunker where the president, vice president, and the national security advisor are all taken if there's ever an attack on Washington. After 9/11, they built a series of bunkers. The go-to bunker is changed randomly without notice. Only a handful of people ever know which one it is on any given day. That's why they call it Roulette. - How do you Know that? - I told you earlier. I'm with the State Department, Jeremy. - No, you never mentioned that to me. - Yeah, I did. I'm assigned to the NSC and the ops center. I work in the White House. I was in New York for a briefing at the UN. - Well, you never mentioned that to me before, man. - Yeah, I tried to tell you earlier, but you cut me off. You didn't trust anything I said, remember? Please, Jeremy. Look, I'm just try- - Okay. All right, is Dave Lao still the senior NSA rep in the ops center? - What, you're quizzing me? Yeah, Brian Nolan replaced him in the ops center two years ago. Dave Lao went to the Pentagon, Sec. Def.'s office. - Okay, you work in the ops center. I want to Know what paintings are hanging in the conference room. - Oh, that's a trick question. There are no paintings in there. Jeremy, please, come on. I'm just a State Department attach. I'm not cut out for this. I'm just trying to stay alive and keep my family safe. - Stop talking. The best thing you can do is to be quiet. - They know where my family lives. You think I'm going to lay here in this trunk and give up? No way. Look, I'm not gonna do that. - Yes, you are, 'cause that's your duty. Your duty's to keep your mouth shut. When you joined State, you took an oath. Don't forget that, man. - Do you have any kids, Jeremy? - No. No, I don't. We, uh- me and my wife got separated three months ago. We were just about to try. It was definitely in the cards. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, me too. I was just trying to make things right with us too. I mean, that's why I was in New York. That's why I went there: to set things straight with this guy I owed money to, and... How many kids you got, Henry? - I have two, seven and nine. Boys. We were supposed to go on vacation in a few weeks to Disney World. My boys love the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster. I can't stand roller caasters, but right now- right now, all I can think about is making it out of here in one piece so I can ride the roller caaster with them, you understand? - Yeah. I hope you get that chance, man. I... I really do. You hear sirens? - Yeah, it sounds like they just passed me. - They passed you? - Yeah. - Pull over to the right. - Damn it, I told you to slow down. We're screwed. - Just relax and play it cool. And make sure he stays quiet back there. - You so much as sneeze, we cut your wife's head off and mail it to her parents. - What are you doing? Put the fucking gun away. - You created this problem. Now let me handle it. - Come on, think. - Act normal. Let me do the talking, now. We'll get a ticket, and we'll be out of here. Shut up. Here he comes. - You gentlemen in a hurry? - I'm real sorry, officer. We're late for a meeting. I guess I wasn't paying attention. - This your car? - Yes, sir, it is. Here's my license and registration. - Hang tight, okay? - Remember, not a fucking sound, or she dies. - Oh, come on. Come on. - Today's your lucky day. Take it a little slower next time. - Thank you, officer. - I'm in here! - What the- - Help! Somebody get me out of here! - Put your hands where I can see 'em. No! - I need backup! No! God damn it! Ah! I'm okay. Oh, shit. Okay, okay. Okay. Motherfucker. Come on. Oh, I got it. Yeah. beep! - Marco. Marco, where are you? I need an answer, an update. Give me an answer. - Marco can't come to the phone right now. - Who is this? - Who the fuck is this? Ah, Agent Reins. I don't know how you got ahold of this phone, but I'm glad you could join us. Molly sends you her love. - Fuck. Come on. Oh, come on, answer. - Hi, this is Molly. I can't get to the phone right now, so leave a message, and I'll call you back. beep! - Molly! Molly, I got a phone back here. Please call me at this number soon as you can. Fuck! - Duty desk, please hold. - No, wait, wait. Hello? Oh, shit. - You have reached the United States Secret Service- - Fuck. Okay. - 911, what is your emergency? - Hello, listen to me carefully. My name is Jeremy Reins. I'm a special agent for the United States Secret Service. I'm being held captive in the trunk of a car. I need help. - Okay, Jeremy, just stay calm. Where are you calling from? - Listen, lady, I just told you. I'm calling from inside the trunk of a car. - Okay, sir, I understand. I'm going to help you. Are you injured? - It doesn't matter right now. Look, my phone is about to die. I called my office several times; I can't reach them. Please reach the Secret Service. Tell them what's happening. - Sir, do you know where you were when you were put in the trunk? - I was in New York City. I was coming out of a restaurant. It was night. It was late. Um, that's it. That's all I remember. - Did you say New York City, sir? - Yes, why? - This is the Baltimore Emergency Communication Center. You're calling from inside our response zone. - Baltimore? All right, look, you gotta find me. You gotta find out where I am, please. Now. Right now. - Sir, I need you to try and stay calm. Can you tell me what kind of phone you're calling on? - Uh... it's an LG. It's old. It's a flip, flip phone. - Sir, if your phone's GPS capability has been disabled, we're going to have to triangulate your position through the cell towers to pinpoint your location. - How close can you get? - Depending on the signal strength, a three- to six-mile radius. - Three to six miles? I could be in fucking Kansas, for all we Know. - Sir, we're going to do the very best we can. Just stay on the line with me, and I'll be right back. - Okay. Fuck. Ah! Hello! Anybody hear me? Hello! Where's your owner, buddy? Who you with, huh? - Sir? Sir, are you all right? Jeremy, are you still with me? - Hold on. Hold on one sec. You with me? - Jeremy? - Hold on. Hold on. - Holding, sir. - One sec. Okay. - Jeremy? - I'm in an alleyway, okay? I can see some abandoned buildings. - How can you see that? - I can see it through a bullet hole. - Did you say bullet hole? - We got pulled over by the police. There was a shoot-out. - Are you injured? Are you in need of medical attention? - I lost a lot of blood, but I tied it off. I should be all right. - Do you see an emergency trunk latch or any way you might be able to escape into the backseat? - Yeah, I see it. I see it. You don't understand. I'm in a box, okay? I can't get to it. - You said you tracked it? You're sure? It's exactly- okay, great, great. okay, great. Jeremy, I have very good news. We've triangulated your position. - Where am I? - You're in Severn, Maryland. I'm sending out police units to the general area. - Wait. Did you say Severn? Severn, Maryland? - Yes, yes, that's correct. - Look, listen to me. I need you to call the Anne Arundel County Police Department. I need units to 22 Green Valley Lane. Do you hear that? 22 Green Valley Lane. Now! - Sir, what is at that address? - My wife. I think whoever's doing this to me is holding her. Look, you have my number. You get that done, and you call me back. - Sir, don't hang up. I need to- click! Here, boy! Hey, hey, get out of that trash. Come here. - Hey! - Come on, Bodie. - Sir! Sir! You in the robe! - Come on. - Sir? Doggie, doggie, come here! I'm in the trunk of a car. Please help me! Yeah, come closer! Straight ahead! Come here, boy! Come here! Yeah, man, I see you! - What the fuck are you doing in there? - I'm being held hostage. I've been in here for hours. Please, just get me out of here, all right? There's gotta be a latch in the front seat. - Hey, is this some kind of a joke, man? - No, man. It's not. I'll give you some money. I'll give you whatever you need. Just open this fucking trunk, please. - Okay, okay, hang on. I don't need money. I'll get you out. - Oh, God, thank you. - Hey, what the hell, man? There's a guy passed out back here. What's the deal? - No, man, he's dead. They shot him. - What are you talking about? Man, I don't know. It better be cool if I let you out. This is fucked up. I got it, man. All right. - Yes! Baby! - All right, hang on. Open it! Open it, buddy! - All right. - No! - Fuck! Let me out of here! Oh, fuck. Come on, man. Come on! What are you doing? Oh, Jesus. - Hello? - Jeremy? - Hey, did you get to the house? What happened? Tell me. - We sent a unit to the address you gave me, sir. I'm sorry, but there wasn't anyone there. - Well, they need to check again. I mean, send 'em back, and have 'em look again. You hear me? Check again. - They searched the entire property, sir. She wasn't there. - Look, is there something you're not telling me? Did they find something? They did, didn't they? Just fucking tell me, honey, please. - Sir, we're doing everything we can for you and your wife. - Tell me what they fucking found! - A note on the doorway, sir. It said, "You'll get her back in one piece if you cooperate." Jeremy, we've dispatched units to your area. They're checking parked cars. We're going to locate you. - I'm already moving. I'm already gone. - Jeremy. Jeremy. - Yeah, I'm here. - The numbers are back. - Yeah, I Know. Mine too. They're timing everything to a tee here, man. There's a complex plan at work. Think it got derailed a bit when we got pulled over by the cops, but... I'm moving again. - I'm running out of time, Jeremy. Something's going to happen soon; I feel it. - What do you mean? What are you talking about? - The numbers, they started at 15. 15 minutes. - Read your numbers to me. - 11:34, 11:33, 11:32, 11:31, 11:30. - The president was arriving back in Washington this morning. - Yeah' I know. I know. Air Force One was touching down at Andrews at 9:40 a.m. I'm sure of that time, because I was joining the national security advisor this morning to brief the president prior to his Vilnius speech on EU expansion. - It's a little after 10:00 now. - How do you know that? - I got a cell phone in here now. Don't ask me how. - Jeremy, I'm begging you. Please, you gotta call my wife. I need to know that she and my boys are okay. I don't know what's going to happen to me, but, please, you gotta do this for me. Please, Jeremy. Come on, man. I'd do this for you. - What's the number? - It's 757-765-4321. That's 757-765-4321. Tell them I love them. Hurry, hur- - I got it. I'll get back to you. - You've reached Special Agent Ben Reynolds, United States Secret Service Recruitment Division. - Fuck. - You've reached Special Agent Dale Carter, United States Secret Service. - Fuck. Where is everybody? What is going on? - From Andrews Air Force Base. As you may have heard already, there have been unconfirmed reports of an explosion inside the facility. With me is Amanda Eastman, a freshman at Prince George's Community College. She stopped to get gas on her way to school this morning when the explosion occurred. Amanda, what can you tell us? - I was just standing over there, filling up my car, when all of a sudden, I heard these really big booms right in a row. Then the ground shook like it was an earthquake or something. When I looked over at the base... - ...Smoke cloud, just like they are now. - I didn't know what was going on, but I knew it wasn't good. - Thank you, Amanda. Right now, a huge cloud of smoke is still billowing. Roads around Andrews are gridlocked. Norman, back to you in the studio. - And updating you right now on our breaking news, all of this just unfolding, Associated Press and local sources confirming now two separate explosions outside ClA headquarters in the Langley suburb of McLean, two blasts occurring within just minutes of each other: one explosion at the National Highway Administration Testing Center, which adjoins ClA headquarters, then a second, larger explosion that's collapsed, apparently, a portion of the George Washington Memorial Highway, which runs directly along the ClA property line. There are unconfirmed reports at this moment that these were car bombings... But we don't want to speculate just yet, because of course the situation is very fluid. As we get more information by the minute, we'll bring it to you. - Coming in. Be advised every floor of the west parking structure is involved. - Additional paramedic units, 10-76. - Center, we have another 10-89. Can you give us a 10-77 on those bomb squad units? Still have multiple casualties throughout the site. - Okay, come on. Oh, please pick up, man. Oh, pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. - Agent Reynolds. - Ben. Ben. It's Jeremy Reins, man. - Jeremy? - What the hell is going on? I've called every extension at the office. I'm not getting anybody. - Jeremy, you're alive. Where are you? - What? What? What do you Know, Ben? - Please don't tell me you're inside the trunk of a car. - How do you Know that? - You're not the only one. Seven others: four Secret Service, two FBl, even the Deputy Chief of Staff, maybe more. We've had several 911 calls. We're trying to locate their positions now. One just detonated outside Langley. Jeremy, I have to go. We're the last ones in the building, and we're evacuating. We could get hit next. - Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Detonated? Wh-what are you talking about? - Bombs. Car bombs. You're lying inside one. I'm sorry, Jeremy. I have to go. I'll call you back at this number. - Wait, Ben, I need your cell. Ben? Ben! I need your cell. Hello? - Jeremy! - Molly? - Oh, my God, I'm in the trunk of a car. And it-it's moving, and I can't get out. - No, no, no. - Fuck. - I'm so scared. - Tell me where you are. What's going on? - I'm in a car, and it's moving, and I don't know what to do. - Okay. All right, just stay with me, all right? - Okay. - I'm here. I'm here. Let's think with each other for a minute, okay? - okay. - Did you see who put you in the car? - I don't know. It all happened so fast. - Okay, all right. I need you to stay calm, all right, babe? We need to think. We need to stay calm and just try to relax, okay? - Why is this happening to us? What do they want? - This is all part of a terrorist attack. They want information on the president's bunker. I've got the info. They're trying to get it out of me. - Oh, my God. This can't be happening. Jeremy. - Listen to me, Molly. Molly, can you hear me? - Yeah. Jeremy, I'm so scared. - I Know. I know. I'm going to get you out of there. I'm going to get you out in one piece, I promise you. Do you believe me? - Yeah. - Listen, there's something I want to tell you, something I've been meaning to tell you for a long time. Um... I'm sorry. I'm sorry... for everything I did with Morgan, for-for not being trusting, and just for letting you down. I... I'm sorry. Why are you- - Hello? Moll-Molly? - Jerem- - Molly! - Jerem- - Hello? Please. Hello? Oh, fuck. Fuck! ...Doing to me? Fuckin' driving me crazy. Oh, God damn, please. Oh, please help us. - Jeremy? Jeremy, are you still there? Come on, Jeremy. Please answer me if you're still there. Jeremy. - I'm still here. - Did you call my family? What's happened to them? Are they all right? - I haven't called 'em, Henry. - Jeremy, please, come on. I'm begging you, please. Please. Damn it, you gotta call them. I need to know that they're okay. I don't have much time. - I'm calling 'em now. - Thank you. Thank you. 757-765-4321. - Who is this? - I'm looking for a Mrs. Shaw. - Who the fuck are you? - Just put her on the goddamn phone. Now. - Bring her to me! - No! Let my mom go! Please let her- - Shut up! - No. No, please, don't. - Now you talk. - They said they're gonna kill my husband. They're gonna kill us all. Please, just give them what they want. No, no. - Now, you listen to me, Agent Reins. Give us the location of Roulette, or I start executing these people one by one. Tell me now! - No. beep! - Jeremy? Jeremy, help! Help me! Something's happening! - What's going on, Henry? What's wrong? - Jeremy, the trunk is filling with some kind of liquid, and I don't know what it is. - Liquid? What? Just keep talking to me, Henry. Just-just don't stop. Keep talking to me. - Jeremy, it's filling. It's filling up, and I think I'm gonna drown. There's no left-time left on the clock. What's gonna happen to me, Jeremy? Are they really gonna let me drown? Jeremy, please. Just give them what they want. This is my life, man. Just tell them. Just tell them! - I'm sorry, Henry, but I can't do that. I'm so sorry. Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from- Henry? Henry, you still with me? Henry. - We are experiencing an unusually high call volume. Please try your call again later. - Oh, shit. - This station, in cooperation with state and federal authorities, has activated the emergency broadcast system. Please do not use your telephone. Stay tuned to this station for news and official information. I repeat, this is not a test. We are standing by for an announcement from the president. With the additional bombings at Andrews Air Force Base and other locations around the capital, it is clear we are under attack. The president and first family have been taken to a secure location. Air Force One touched down at Andrews Air Force Base just minutes before three bombs exploded there. Smoke can now be seen for miles all around Washington, and more explosions may be imminent. Please stay off the highways and roads. Emergency vehicles need to get through. Stay in your homes. We're awaiting the president's address. As soon as that happens, we will go directly to it. Right now, though, let's go immediately to Suzanne Gibbs at the Capitol. And, Suzanne, you had a front-row seat to see what's going on there as lawmakers stream out of their offices. - Hello? - Jeremy, it's Ben. Are you there? - Ben. Ben, what do you Know? What is going on? - Car bombs are going off all over the district. We can't locate them before they detonate. They're a step ahead of us every goddamn time. - Ben, they have Molly. They have her in a trunk. I talked to her. - Ah, Jesus, Jeremy, I'm sorry. - Listen to me. They're targeting the president. - Well, I'm getting this all secondhand, but the vice president's safe. I don't know about POTUS and the first family. My guess is, they're already off the locator, but I can't get confirmation. I'm out of the loop since I took over recruitment. - That's what the terrorists want. They want everything to go underground. - What are you talking about? - How many bombings have there been? - Five confirmed: Andrews, Langley, a toll station on 395, Reagan National, and now the 14th Street bridge. That's a huge mess. The District's completely paralyzed. - That's what they're doing. They're taking away all the avenues. They're taking away all our resources. They're containing the fucking city so nobody can get in or out, even the president. - Then he's certainly been secured. - Yeah, at Roulette. That's why I'm in here. They want the location of Roulette. That's what they're trying to get out of me. - Jeremy, listen to me. They may already have that from one of the other captives. We have to warn the protection detail. - No, it won't work, man. He's already in the bunker. - Goddamn it, Jeremy! There's an imminent threat to the president. His location may have been compromised. I'll go myself. Just tell me where. - Why are you asking me that, Ben? You Know I can't say anything. They're listening to me. - What about Molly? You never told her anything, did you? - No. No, nothing. She Knows nothing. They're using her as leverage against me. - Jeremy, just trust me on this. We're tracking the cell number. We will find you. - Listen to me. You find Molly first. You track her phone, and you find her. I'm begging you, man. You do this for me, okay? Don't even think about coming for me. You find Molly. - Somebody get on that other line. Jeremy, is there anything else you can tell me? Anything at all? - You're running out of time. - We're doing what we can as fast as we can. Now, listen, you're gonna have a hard time reaching me because we're on the move, but I promise I'll call you back as soon as I can. Hang in there. - Yeah. Okay, Ben. - For those of you just joining us now, we're on the line with someone calling himself Jeremy who may be involved in these attacks. Sir, this is Real Time Morning News. - What the fuck? - Are you still with us? - Hang up the goddamn phone. - Can you confirm what's taking place? Are you one of them? - I said hang up the goddamn phone. You're doing exactly what they want. - Uh, you're live on the air, sir. - I don't give a shit! You Know what you're doing? - I want to repeat for our viewers right now- can you confirm whether or not you're involved in this? - No, I'm not a terrorist. - Then are you a hostage? Because we have reports they've taken hostages as well. - Who is this? What's your name? - This is Jack Stern, anchor for Real Time Morning News. - Okay, Jack. Let's have a little conversation, all right? The best thing you can do for everyone is to disconnect this call, to hang up, 'cause right now, you're doing everything to their plan. They want to instill fear and panic. You're doing that. They want paranoia. You're helping the bad guys, man. So stop! - Can you tell us anything, anything at all about this attack? - You Know what? You're an asshole, you fuckhead! How much do I have to curse before you'll turn me off? Stop this, please! - Had enough? If you want out, give us Roulette. - Go fuck yourself! No. No, I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry! I'll tell ya, all right? I'll tell you what you want to know- Listen. Listen, I'm sorry, all right? I'm ready to talk. I'm ready to deal. I Know you can hear me in there, all right? - I'm listening. - You're American, man. You're a fuckin' American. Why are you doing this? Why are you part of this? - Just tell us where Roulette is, or this conversation is over! - No, it's not, 'cause you need me, remember? You need me, not the other way around! I ain't telling you shit. You fuckin' failed, man. You fuckin' failed miserably. You do all this, all this effort, and you got nothing. You got nothing out of me. How about that, huh? You fuckin' idiots. Five minutes, huh? Five minutes till what, motherfucker? - Until you die! Good-bye, Jeremy. - No, I say when this is over! I do! You don't turn me off! I turn you off! Get it? Fuck you! God. Hello? Hello? - Jeremy! - Oh, thank God, Molly! - Oh, I've been trying to reach you. - Oh, baby. - What's happening? Where are you now? - The emergency broadcast system's in effect. I've been calling you, babe. I can't reach you. Are you okay? - Jeremy, I think I know where I am. I think I'm in an ambulance. - How do you Know that? - It's dark in here, but I can hear the siren. It sounds like it's right on top of me. - Hold on. Shh. - What? - Something's happening. - okay. - They're stopping in traffic. Are you moving, Molly? - Barely. Please, Jeremy, this time, you gotta get us out of this. - I promise you, baby, I've got my whole team on this. The whole office is looking for you. I'm gonna find you, I promise you, baby. I promise. - okay. - What? - Molly? Talk louder. - What's happening? Jeremy, are you okay? - Holy fuck! You were right! You're in an ambulance, and I'm in the back of a fucking police car. - Jeremy? - Molly! Moll? - Jeremy, I can't- I can't hear- - Molly! Ah. Molly! Ah, fuck! God. Hold on. Hello? - Hold that signal, and get to her as soon as possible. - Ben? - Jeremy, listen, we've located Molly. We're on our way. - Where is she? - Dupont Circle. - Dupont Circle. That's a mile from the White House. - I know. I know. We're working as fast as we can. - Well, work faster. - We're trying. It's chaos out here. The roads are gridlocked. I don't even know how they're transporting her. - Look, she's in an ambulance. I'm in the back of a police car. That's how they're getting us through traffic. - Jesus! Guys, she's in an ambulance. Let's go. Let's go! - I'm not moving right now. As far as I Know, she's not either. You're running out of time, man. - How much time? - You got about three minutes. You need to clear the area, and you need to keep the roadblocks in place. Don't let any cars through, not even emergency vehicles. You hear me? - I'll do what I can. - No, you promise me! You don't let any cars through. - Look, Jeremy, I can't promise anything. - Ben? Ben! Ben? Ben? - One last chance, Jeremy. Give us the fucking location of Roulette. - I'm not giving you anything. I'm not giving you a goddamn thing! - Then good luck to you, Agent Reins. I'll tell Molly good-bye for you. - You lay one hand on her, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. Oh, come on. Please pick up. Please, please, please pick up. - Jeremy. - Hello, Molly? Oh, thank God. Are you okay? - I'm-I'm moving again. - Oh, the fuckin' roadblocks. I told him to keep 'em in place. - What-what roadblocks? Jeremy, what the hell's going on? What's happening? - Listen to me. Do you trust me? - Jeremy. - Do you trust me? - Yes, I trust you. - Okay. - What? - Well, we're together, babe. - What? - We're traveling right next to each other. - What? Did-did you tell them what they wanted to know? - No. I can't do that. I took an oath, Molly. Jeremy, please. I don't want to die today. Please just give them what they want. Please, for me. - I never wanted to do anything to let you down, ever. I Know I've done things to hurt you. I never wanted to in my life. - Jeremy. - But I hurt you, and I'm sorry. I... I can't think about those things now. I can't do anything about it. But I'm asking you now to accept me, to accept me for who I am. - Of course. Of course, baby, I accept you. I love you no matter what. - I love you so much. - I love you. - I love you so much. Molly! Molly! Molly. Oh, what the fuck? Moll! Hello? - Jeremy, it's Ben. - Ben. Ben, it's almost filled up to the top, man. - I know; it's a binary explosive, a liquid bomb, and you're dead either way. But I can save Molly, so tell us what we want to know. - "We"? You were a part of this, Ben? - It's just business, my friend. - It's not business! - Give us the location of Roulette. - You're a coward, man! You're a fuckin' traitor! You were my friend! - Enough! Just give us Roulette. - You were my friend, man. - Good-bye, Jeremy. Molly. - Breathe, Jeremy. Breathe. Take it easy. Come here. Jeremy. Whoa, easy, easy. You're safe now. Jeremy, it's Henry. I'm Henry. It's Henry. Put the gun down, okay? Everything's cool, all right? - Jeremy? Jeremy, I'm here. - Molly. - I'm okay. - You did good, real good. - Are you kidding, boss? He did fuckin' great. This guy's fuckin' hard-core. - Ben, don't fuckin' move! - Jeremy? Stop! It's over. - Stop what? What's over? What the fuck is this? - It was merely an exercise, and you passed, Jeremy. You passed with flying colors. - I don't understand. Stay back. - I didn't transfer to recruitment last year. I'm the protection detail training coordinator, and you're at Beltsville. This is AOP training ground. - You did all this? You set all this up? Why? - Yeah, we've done lots of stress tests since 9/11. It sure beats the hell out of a polygraph, don't you think? And it was important, Jeremy. It was crucial for your transfer to the presidential detail. Starting next month, you're on the Asia trip. Congratulations, you're on your way to the show. - Good job, Agent Reins. - Nice work. - Congratulations. - Nice. Good job. - 911, what is your emergency? My alter ego. Great, great work, Agent Reins. - Headed down the I-95. Agent Daniel Wade, retired. Great job. - I had to, uh, channel my inner actress from my school drama days. - We told her about the importance of this exercise, and Molly agreed to help us. - I'm so sorry. - No. - He's lost a lot of blood. We got to get that leg patched up. - Okay. - Sorry about that hot-load Simunition. Probably made it way too much. We'll revisit that the next exercise. - Yeah, I think that'd be a good idea. - Meet you at the hospital for debriefing. - Hey, Ben? You really had me, man. - Yeah. Well, that was the idea. - All right, ladies and gentlemen, great job. Let's wrap it up and go home. Let's clear those vehicles over there. We got to get this ambulance through. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay. I'm here. - Where am I? - You better be careful, or you're going to rip this thing of your arm. You're in an ambulance. You passed out when they gave you a sedative in your IV. - Hi. - Hi. - How long have I been out? - About half an hour. - Be pulling into Walter Reed in about 15 minutes. - Thank you. - How'd they get you involved in all this? - They paid me. I mean, I didn't take 'em to the cleaners or anything, but I got what we needed. I paid off Morgan. - Really? - Yeah. Clean slate. You're done with him. - You Know, I didn't make a bet since after we were apart. - I Know. I Know. Bastard said he lost his best client. - Does anybody else Know? - Just Ben and his team. And he Knows you're done with it too. He's the one that cleared you for the presidential detail. - Well, he'd better have. Crazy son of a bitch. He went a bit extreme with this whole thing, huh? - Yeah. Well, that's Ben for you. Well, at least you get the rest of the day off. And it's beautiful outside. Look. - What? What's so funny? - Oh, nothing. - Really? The Washington Monument? That's it? That's where it is? - It's not important now. Wait, wait. Will you marry me? - We are married. - Marry me again? I just got a big-ass promotion. What are you doing? What the fuck is this? What's this for? What are you doing? Who are you talking to? - Did you get that? - Washington Monument. We have what we need. - What are you doing? You still playing with me? Come on, guys. You still testing me? Molly, you're scaring me. Look at me. - Where do you want us? - Abort plan C, and dismantle the ER. The operation can commence on schedule. - And the subject? - Molly. - He's broken. Eliminate him. - What the fuck are you doing? - Copy that. - I trusted you. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? What the hell is that? I trusted you. I tried to change for you. What the fuck is this? Fuck you. - Stay down. Hey!
