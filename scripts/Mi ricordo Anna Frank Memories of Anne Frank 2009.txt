There are lots of children. - Hello, what's your name? - Hanneli Goslar. - What's your name? - Anne Frank. A FEW YEARS LATER - Today we have Geography. - Thursday Geography. - What nation? - We are going to study Italy. Could someone be so kind... ..as to give their seats to two elderly ladies? Who are the children? Hans and Christian. Hurry, gave me the papers. What are they for? I am a princess. - Are you ready? - Give me crown. - How many children do you want? - At least ten. - You? - I am going to be a writer. I am ready. Well done! This is our present. It's what you wanted, isn't it? Thank you. You're so pretty. If my daughter could have celebrated her 50 years here... ..she would have prepared a surprise. Thanks to you we celebrated her birthday in a nice way. Thank you. Mr Frank. I want to ask you something. You told Anne's story. But you haven't told us why the people were so evil? - What is your name? - Elisabeth. - Yes, I haven't explained. Didn't they know or were they afraid too? - No. They knew. - Then why were they still evil? I wondered the same things many years ago. I've never found an answer. - What is it? - My diary. - Can i see it? - No. It's my business. Sorry, but... I've started writing. To do it well you have to keep it secret. I promise I'll be a nurse in Palestine. -Then I'll be a grandmother and have grandchildren.-Yes?-I swear. - Look! - Yes. Tickets, please. Papers. I'm going on the white horse. Jews can no longer come here. You'll have to wear the yellow star as from tomorrow. Go away. - Come, children. - Go away. - Come one. - What did we do? - We're Jewish. They won't allow us to stay here. Mr Frank, can God foresee the future? I do believe so. God must see everything. The past, the present, the future. Has he seen everything? - Sure. - Then God will answer our question. There's no point knowing everything if he won't tell us what he knows. - Father, don't. I'm going to work in Germany. - No, it's a trap. -Those who go, never come back.-Are we going to hide for long?-Who knows. - Maybe a month. - I'll tell Hanneli. - No one must know. - What is that flower for? - Jews have to wear a yellow star. As from today we Dutch will wear a flower of the same colour. The Germans won't arrest everyone, they'll stop persecuting you. They're our friends, I'll open. - Hurry, come in. - Hello, Anne. - Hello, Peter. - Come with me. There. Remove your shoes during the day... ..or the workers will hear you. Be careful. Thank you, Miep. You are very brave. You would have done the same for me, Mr Frank. Hanneli! Anne didn't come to school. Has she gone to Switzerland? Yes, Mr Frank has relatives in Switzerland. Why didn't Anne tell us she was leaving? Maybe she didn't know. Mr Frank must have told her... ..at the last moment to take no risks. - It's not possible. - I'll give you their address so you can write. - No! - I'll give you their address so you can write. - No! Draw the curtains, they can see you! Get on the truck, quick! Get on. - Hurry. - There's no time. Hurry, get on the truck. Get on! I'm done. Father! Hanneli, go and wake up your sister. - Are there Jews here? - Are there Jews? Are there Jews? - Get on. - Go! Let's go. - Are there Jews here? - No! Are there Jews here? - Are there Jews here? - Yes. Don't be afraid. Hanneli, stay with me. Go on. We are Jews who have been allowed to emigrate to Palestine. Let us in- I was vice-minister in Germany. It says here, look. I... - Hurry. - Come. Go on. "After the defeat of Stalingrad the Germans..." "..are leaving the Soviet Union." "Thousands of German soldiers are prisoners of the Red Army." "The Allies' Air Force is bombing the main German cities." "They've shot down 65 enemy planes." They've taken the Goslars. We should have kept them here. Hanneli is my best friend. - What will they do to her? - There was no room for them here. Her sister is small, she wouldn't have managed. It would have been dangerous for everyone. They'd have discovered us. I shouldn't have said that. No, I want to know the truth. Anne. Can you come? Can I talk to you? Help me, I have to give her a present. - She mustn't know. - Yes. Wait a little more. You can open your eyes. - Happy birthday. - Thank you, Father. Look. Darling. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. You've given me all the paper in Amsterdam! This is mine. Thank you. Well done. The Allies are less than 200 km away. They've freed Belgium. - It's almost over. - God couldn't allow Germany to win. - What is it? - What do you want from us? - Look. - Let's go upstairs. - What is behind the shelf? - What you see, a wall. Are you sure? You're under arrest. - Do you have money, jewels, gold? - Hand in everything. What is in here? - Whose is this uniform? - Mine. - Did you fight for Germany? - Yes, in World War I. You should have said. We have to take you away. I am giving you 10 minutes to get ready. We'll wait outside. Who betrayed us? Come. - Here? - Hurry. -Where are you taking them?- I'm leaving or I'll have to arrest you. - I am an Austrian, like you. - Thank God for that. GESTAPO HEADQUARTERS - Lower Siebel Bauer. - Here. -What are you doing here?-Where are the people you arrested yesterday? -We can give no information. -I'd like to make an offer. -Not here. - What is it? - The release papers. - That's impossible. - I'll bring more money. - It's late. - Why? - It's not up to me. - I'll talk to your superiors. - You are brave but also foolish. - Who should I talk to? Go upstairs to Colonel Saxenland. It will do no good. Why are you doing this? You are Aryan, what do you care about Jews? I decide according to my conscience. What about you. "Radio London. After the recent attack..." - Who are you? - I need news about some of your prisoners. - The Frank family was arrested yesterday. - Leave! Colonel, you've lost the war. You know that. It makes no sense to keep deporting people. I am offering you money. You'll need it. - I'll arrest you. - No! You were listening to Radio London. Then I'll have to kill you. I am a citizen of the Reich and Aryan like you. If you shoot me, you'll have to explain why. If you shoot me, you'll have to explain why. - They're American planes. - They'll destroy the rail tracks. - Save us. - You must save us! We're here. Bomb the rail tracks. Help us. - We're here. - Bomb the rail tracks. - No! - They're leaving. - Come back! It's absurd. The bomb Germany instead of the railroad. They can't not know who is in the trains. - The Allies are not fighting for the Jews. - They're helping them. All they want is to exterminate us. What does God want from us? - If he exists, why is he allowing it? - Do you believe in the sun.. ..even if it not shining one day? Do you believe in love, even if you don't see it? I believe in God even when he is hiding. Anne. - I'm scared. - Give me your hand. Close your eyes. Close you eyes. You're not on this train, you're in Amsterdam. You're in the attic where we could see the sky. You se the sun shining through the curtains. - Can you see it? - Yes. Look at them. They are happy even in here. It's evening and we are lying on the grass. It's hot. We are looking at the clear sky, lit by the moon. Look,there are millions of stars. They are far, but they send us their light to be seen. Maybe someone lives there. They're on the grass looking at the Earth. Once this is over, will you marry me? - Once we are free I want to marry you. - We are free, Peter. - Once we are free I want to marry you. - We are free, Peter. - The train has stopped. - Where are we? Where are we? We're at Auschwitz. It's our turn. - What are you reading? - I am studying for my exam. You could have asked to be sent elsewhere. - Where does this train come from? - Holland. - Good. -If they come from the West, they have goods in their satchels. -Quick. It's Strauss. It can be bad if we are greeted with music. Get out! - Quick. - Out. - Leave your luggage. Move. - Get off the train. - Out. - Get out. - Leave your luggage. - Go on. - Leave your luggage. - Hurry! - Quick. - Leave the luggage on the ground. - Hurry. Hurry with the luggage. Move! - Father, I am scared. - Where are we going? - I don't know. - I'm with you. - Hurry. - Get down. Hurry! Everyone out! - Get out! - Rabbi! - Move! - Rabbi. - Rabbi! - I'm here. Don't worry. I'm here. Let's sing. You begin. I'm here. Let's sing. You begin. - Very good. - Follow me. - Come with me. - Where are you taking them? - I'm the teacher. - Stay there! - Let's go. - No! Where are you taking them? - You'll see them again. - I'm their teacher. - What do you teach? - History and Philosophy. - Stay there! - They need me. Me too. You're a teacher? Go with the men. Me too. You're a teacher? Go with the men. Me too. You're a teacher? Go with the men. Men on one side, women on the other. Women here, men there. You must go there! - No! - Go to the other side. - Don't leave us. I won't leave you. - No! - It's my wife. - Let me go. Enough! Women must stay here. Stay here. I have a wife and 2 children. Let me stay with them. - I can give you this. It is gold. - Where are they? This is my family. Your watch is nice. Don't worry. - Men on that side. Women... - No! - Dad! - No! - Let me go. - Dad! - No! - Let me go. Dad! Mom! - No, let me go! - He is my son. - Dad. - Don't leave me! Dad! - How old are you? - 16. - 16! You can stay. Dad! Take them away. You. - How old are you? - I... - 16. Just turned 16. - Is it true? - Yes. - Is it true? - Yes. - Dad. - Anna. - Dad! - Anna. Margot! - Dad. - Anna. - Dad. - Edith! - Dad! - Dad. - Edith! - Dad! Now you must do all I say. Understand? Get undressed. Hurry and obey. - Move! - No. - Get undressed. Take your clothes off. Get undressed! Obey or you'll be in trouble. Hurry. Take everything off. Take off your rings and watches too. Leave everything on the ground. Hurry! - Hurry up. - Mom, hurry. - I can't. Move. If you hide something, you'll be punished. Get under the showers. Go under the showers. - Hurry! - I won't remain naked. - Come on, Mom. - I can't. - You're still here? - Get undressed and wash. - I'll help my mom. - No. She can get undressed by herself. You. You. You. Where are you taking us? To take a shower. Come. Wait here. When they've finished you go in. - Anna. - Children! - Why are you there? - We must wait... ..for the others to finish. - Where is the rabbi? - He promised he wouldn't leave us. - He'll come. - Come. - Sing. - Where is the rabbi? - Where is he? - Start singing. Come on. The rabbi would say, "Form a nice chorus, kids!" "All together. One, two, three." "All together. One, two, three." "All together. One, two, three." "All together. One, two, three." "All together. One, two, three." "All together. One, two, three." "All together. One, two, three." You want to go with them too? You want to go with them too? - Coming with us? - Sing. - Coming with us? - Sing. Well? Well? Take them to the rabbi. Don't leave them alone. Come. Come. Come. - What're you doing here? - Where are they taking them? - What're you doing here? - Where are they taking them? What do you think that smoke is? Dad, after two years we are free. I can see Anna again. - Get in! - Where are they taking us? - To the Allies. - Then we'll leave for Palestine. - What is it? It is a place where people like us can live in peace... ..without running away and hiding. We can do anything. - Stop! - We will be free. - There won't be an exchange. The prisoners must return to the barracks. - The exchange with the Americans was anulled. - Go back. - No. - Go back right now. - What is going on? - We're not going to Palestine. - We won't be free, huh, Dad? - Go back. - Go on! Get off the truck. Get off. Dad, will I see you again? Hanneli, where are you? What are you doing? Don't you know that writing is forbidden? Anna, go back inside. - You're freezing. You'll catch a fever. - I need to write. - What? - Mom, please. Help me. - It's not possible. Please, Mom. I need a pencil and paper. - What's the matter? - I can give you my bread... ..if you want. - Anna, I am your mother. Everyone out for a control! Get in line in fours in the middle of the barracks! I can give you this for a pencil and a piece of paper. It's not enough. I want another 3 rations of bread. Come out! Move! I can't live without my family. - Will I see my children again? - You! - We must continue our lessons. - Move! Go on! Go on! I studied what you told me, but maybe you deceived me. - I never deceived anyone. - Deceiving is in your nature. The worst plagues have come from you people. Witchcraft and usury in the Middle Ages, atheism, Bolshevism. - Psychoanalysis, Christianity. - Are you being funny? Many say that even humor was invented by the Jews. Sit down and ask me questions! Be severe. Where are my children? You want to help me with the exam or not? What is God for you? He who created everything. Explain the words, "The starry sky above me..." "..the moral law inside of me." It means that God is away from us in the sky... ..and men are alone. So each man must decide for himself. - Conscience? - Something you Jews invented. - What is a law? - A rule that goes for everyone. So? Can you explain why there are good people and bad people? - The Germans are good, the Jews aren't. - I didn't ask who... ..but why. I answered. The Jews are bad because they are Jews. Did you ever meet a bad German? - That has nothing to do with it. - Can you explain... ..the meaning of moral law? What do the words "Love your brother as yourself" mean? What does "Do not do unto others..." "..what you would not want done to you" mean? Well? What does it mean? - Go away! - I'm sorry to have to tell you. You are not ready for your exam yet. I imagine you are wondering why I struck you. Because we both know... ..that I shouldn't have. You know why? Inside our soul we all know what is right... ..and what is wrong. It's as if we all had a compass inside. A secret compass that indicates the same direction. That is the moral law the philosophers talk about. It is the reason you don't want to do to others... ..what you would not be done to you. We also know, that if you want, you can kill me. Many of us do not follow moral laws... ..such as me, when I hit you. - Mr. barracks boss. - Buch! - Come! - Yes, sir. Anna. - Thanks, Mom. - Don't thank me. Forgive me. Can you forgive me? I said horrible things. Anna, I am your mother and you are my little girl. There will be the last selection today. Himmler's orders. The Russians are near. We must destroy the installations... ..and eliminate the evidence. Buch, are your satisfied with your assignment? - Yes, excellency. - Did you ever waver? - No. Our human material is disappointing us. Even that of the chosen SS corps. - I will do my duty. - I am pleased. - Thanks, excellency. It is difficult to hold back pity. Reichsfuhrer Himmler said that too. To kill women and children in cold blood... ..and remain sane people... ..you need courage, moral strength and mental lucidity. We can begin with the procedure. Today's is the latest. You. You. I won't get past the selection today. I know. You must be self confident. You'll make it, Peter. - I have a high fever. - Be quiet. - I'll end up in the cremating oven. - Be quiet. Commander. - What do you want? - I want to submit my case to your attention. - I'm listening. - I cannot work any longer. It's not right that I continue being a burden to the administration. Alright. For us, one piece is like any other. - Did you think over what I said? - You deceived me. You are young and have time to find your answer. - Then I'll pass your test. - You didn't tell me everything. - Sure? - That's how you'll end up. - Like my children, I know. Does your conscience tell you to do that? Think about it. If you want to pass the exam, this is the most important question. How many times must I tell you it is forbidden to write? Why? - You must leave. - Where is my mother? - Go on! - Where is my mother? - Anna! - Where is my mother? - I don't know. My father and mother are here. Don't take me away. Think your father is still alive? You! - Can you run? - Sure. Come with me. Anne, look! It's Peter! Stop! Dear God, please save Peter. Take this to the Commandant, run. - Anne! - Mum! - Margot! Anne! - Mum! - Anna! Where are they taking you? - I don't know. Special Prisoner's Infirmary The Lord begins to create the heavens and he earth. However our beautiful earth was deserted, completely empty. Dark shadows covered the immense oceans... ..and an impetuous wind blew everywhere. - It blew over the earth and the oceans. - What did he do then? The Lord fashioned man from a handful of earth. Then he blew a breath of life-giving air over it. -In this way God gave man the great gift of life. -That was Adam? Yes. Yes. Here's my gift. This is mine. If mum were here, she'd make chocolate cake. - What's a cake? - A round thing, sweet and very good. - What does "sweet" mean? - It's a taste. If you could touch it, it would feel smooth and soft. - What's chocolate? - Something good. - Darling, close your eyes. Here's a surprise. Like it, darling? Blow out the candle. - Thanks dad. - Best wishes. Bergen-Belsen Prison Camp Look, there are no chimneys in this camp. I know that here they swap special Jewish prisoners... ..for German prisoners. -What are those tents there? -Many Hungarians and Dutch arrived. - Dutch? - Yes. Is there anyone from Amsterdam among you? I'm Hanneli Goslar, from South Amsterdam. - What's your name? - Hanneli Goslar, from Amsterdam. - Hanneli Goslar? - Yes. - Hanneli, is that really you? - Yes. - Hanneli! I'm Peter's mum. I remember, we met at the Frank's house... ..before Anne left for Switzerland. - No. - Anne is here. - Anne is here? Yes, I'll go call her. Anne is here! Anne is here. Hanneli. Where are you? Hanneli, is that really you? Are you Hanneli Goslar? Yes, Anne. Why are you here? Did the Germans invade Switzerland? No. We hid at dad's company in Amsterdam. - Are the others here too? - Margot is here, she's very ill. Where are your parents? - My father is dead. - I want to come closer, where are you? - I want to see you, Anne. - I'm close to the seventh light. Anne, I must see you! Anne, what are you doing? Come back here. - Hanneli. - I'm here. - Careful. - I want to see her. - I want to see Hanneli. - Please, come back here. Come back here! - Anne! - Hanneli, where are you? They cut my hair off. They don't give us anything to eat. I'll never grow up. We'll grow up together. As soon as I can, I'll bring you something to eat. Soon we'll be at school again and your hair will have grown back. Anne, come away! - I'll come back, I promise. - I'll wait for you. Come on. Dad, I spoke to Anne. Where is he? Your father is dead, go back to your huts. - Quickly! - Burn those papers! The Russians are bombing us! Are you ready? Are you ready? - Follow me! - We've finished. - Quickly! We're ready, Commandant. - Do it. - Blow everything up! The Germans are leaving! The Germans are leaving! Silence! Be silent! Stop it! Shut up! Shut up. - Get rid of all the evidence, understand? All of it! - Yes sir. Do you really think they'd let us go like that? They destroyed the crematorium to get rid of the evidence. - They don't want the Russians to find it. - What does it matter? They won't make the selections any more. They have other evidence to get rid of. Don't you understand? What evidence? - What evidence, Otto? - What evidence? - Take my shoes. - What about you? - I'll stay here. - I've got fever. - If you stay... - I'd die on the march anyway. - You can do it, I'll help you. - Listen. If Edith, Anne and Margot are still here, I can't go. If they take them away, it's best if you go with them. Be quick. If you find them before me, tell Anne I'll keep my promise. I'll marry her. Goodbye, father. Good luck, my son. All those still here, come out for roll-call! Move it! Quickly, everyone out! You too. You know you did something you shouldn't have. But you don't want to listen to your conscience. You must kill us because we're the last remaining evidence. Ready. - The Russians are here! - Retreat! Evacuate the camp, quickly! Go! We're Red Army soldiers. You're free now. Are there any Jews left in Krakow? There's not a single Jew left in Poland. So we're free to go where? I don't know, neither the East or the West wants you. My family. Our families want us. Edith Frank. Anyone know Edith Frank? Please, help me. I'm looking for Edith Frank. She's a Dutch woman with two daughters, she's my wife. - Has anyone seen her? - Look in the archives. Anne! Anne! Anne! Anne! Anne. Anne, where are you? Anne, where are you? I'm here, Margot. I'm dying, aren't I? Tell me. We're not here. Can you see our house, Margot? We're in the kitchen. Mum has just done the washing and the sun is out. Can you see the sun too? It's setting. The beautiful red sun of Amsterdam is shining. Look how it's shining on the water. And between the leaves on the trees. - Can you see? - Yes, I can see. Now... You're back home. Miep. Mr. Frank! Have Anne and Margot returned? Not yet. Edith will never return. Nurse, excuse me. I'm looking for Hanneli Goslar. - She's over there. - Thanks. Hanneli. - Mr. Frank! - Hanneli! - Anne was sure you were dead. - You saw Anne? At Bergen-Belsen, but then they evacuated her camp. - Then Anne is alive. Was Margot with her? - Yes. Your father? Your father? - I have a message for Mr. Frank. - Come in. - Mr. Frank. - Yes? - I have this for you. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Father! Father! Anne's diary. No-one has read it, not even me. Your daughter is in here. Anne Frank is here. Miep. You saved her, Miep. Anne is still alive in here. Thank you, Miep. Here she'll always be my 15-year-old Anne. - These are your passports. - Thanks. In Switzerland you'll find your uncle, he'll take you to Palestine. - Will we meet again? - Sure. If you like, I'll be a father to you. - Sure. - This is a gift from Anne. - Open it on the plane. - Yes. Get on board. Why did Anne die but not me, Mr. Frank? Every day I ask myself the same question. Why Anne and not me? Why Margot and Edith and not me? I don't know, but I'll spend all my life trying to understand. - Promise? - Promise. Thanks, father. No, thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. - What is it? - Chocolate. - This is the sweet stuff? - Yes. - Who's that woman? - Our mother. - She's with our father now. - Can I see? You kept your promise, Anne. You became a writer. Hanneli made her dream come true. She lives in Israel and has dozens of grandkids. If in the years to come you tell your children... ..and they tell their children everything that you have heard... ..I'll have kept my promise. You question to Almighty God will be answered, Elisabeth. No-one will again raise their hand against the next man... ..because it is us who must respect the law. This is freedom. Know what freedom is, Elizabeth? Going to sleep knowing you have done no harm to anyone. Freedom and goodness are the same thing... ..and it's difficult to be good every day. This is the only answer I can give you. I'd have liked to have given the same answer to Anne. Thank you, Mr. Frank. Victory! Hanneli Goslar lives in Jerusalem surrounded by grandchildren... ..as she had always wished. This film is liberally inspired by her memoirs... ..written in the book "I Remember Anne Frank" by Alison Leslie Gold. Some references to persons and events are purely coincidental.
