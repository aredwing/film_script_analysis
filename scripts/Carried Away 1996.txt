Not just the girl for the farm, right? The father is an avid hunter. My mother was an alcoholic. He is trying to wean. Ask him if he needed some supplies for the farm. The money we would definitely use it. If Joey cashed in all This small change ... that we would probably be enough for the entire year. These cans of milk are in a bad place.

Indeed, Mr Svenden, you can not expect to provide you with ... to continue to teach without a proper degree. I do not even believe you ever went to college. You see, I think Mr Svenden understand ... positions Board takes up ... But, he teaches here ... more than twenty years. Not one of his students has never been ... denied admission to the college for academic reasons. Of course, there are not many those who wanted to go ... but the son of Mrs. Johnson received at the university ... academic scholarship, and he is good. It happened. We have two perfectly good schools in the city ... where surrender professional educators. What do you offer that they will not? Opportunity to learn the basic principles ... free bus ride sixty miles a day ... After getting up at dawn and performing household tasks. These children have hardly enough time ... to compete with children in the city. Why can not you just to take a course in college ... and get a diploma, as Mrs. Henson? I have not taught in college. With all due respect, Madam, I've had more time and resources ... available than which was given by Mr Svenden. Do not let me opravdava. I could not do that, that ... but I did not think that the school board ... want to expand their activities this far out of town. I tried to combine service with my life. I guess I was wrong. G. Svenden, surely you can not us to blame for your failure. You had every chance to gain their credentials. You already have your opinion on this. Nothing else here can not say it would change anything, right? No. I'm afraid that's true. We do not see any reason ... to re-consider this matter. Then why are you me hell, let ... to waste time talking to you? We do not need such Dictionary, Mr. Svenden. This is because you have a bunch of pompous asshole. I think you owe this board an apology. For what? There are no rules to asshole I can not call you asshole. Rozali. It is time to marry me. I know. Well, tell me. Say: "Will you marry me?" Want to make you happy. ... The truth? - Yes. You do me happy. As Orin and done? I am going home. Hey ... You are beauty, all right. You're a beauty, all right. Here you go. Well, sir, it holds its own. That's good. Yes. Is there any hunting in lately? I'm a little out. I left after a few duck with Major last week. We had three gorgeous ... not mine. His. That bastard is a great scorer, To admit him. Good is almost like you. - Really? ... Close. He told me he saw a coyote down around Ferry Road. Prepared to go to it. There are no coyotes in This part of the country. Maybe it was a wolf. - There are no wolves. Come with me I have something to give. I'd like to have this. I realized last week the hard way ... that my back was just not as they should be. Hunt and I are finished. Jesus, doc. I do not know what to say. Are you sure about this? I know that you always wanted. I am tired of its lubrication. In any case, more I love that you have ... but that we are dragging around and rust. OK, call me if any changes ... and let it do what it wants. Jesus, Catherine. I'm Lady Godiva. Do you like it? Coming down from a horse, you crazy. What if someone enters? What would happen? Just me by surprise. I am an old man. Take care of my heart. What if a major find out about us? What if I find out? Here, something smells good. Bake wild duck. Joey, you're all dirty! Are you drunk? Now clean it up. Dinner is almost ready. I'm fine, Mom. I'm completely wrong. Look at what my doctor immediately. It's nice of him. He said that too old to hunt. Can you imagine that? Too old to hunt. How are you feeling, Mom? I feel as if someone forgot claws in the stomach. Do you want to invite others. Evans? No, no, no. You have to marry Rosalie. I know, Mom. She told me that he thought do not want to marry. I said: "Nonsense." You just wait to die so stop thinking about it. I know that you wanted to marry with the her when she married Orin.

Now, what I I say this ... people think that poetry is too complicated. They think it's boring. - Boring. That's right! Usually is, mainly because ... which he wrote a bad poet. We say that a good poetry what is easy. Let us say that it is what we feel ... morning when you breeze caressing your face ... When you first feel the smell of the ocean. When you first see the ocean ... What did you feel? Oh ... I think I was scared. True emotion. She could write about it. OK, now we have a little test. I want to write a song ... about a place where you were earlier, perhaps the lake ... a place where You feel something. I think if you were somewhere ... You can write about it. I'm sorry. No, everything is fine. It's okay. Explain what you said. What happened? - Small accidents. Catherine had dropped my picture, that's all. Come on. Well, let's Emily Dickinson. She wrote many love letters to a man ... and yet say that died a virgin. I mean, even if you never physically met the man ... Yet she wrote some of the best love songs ... in the entire literature. OK, that's true. And what's the point? Well, you do not have to experience something ... to write passionately about it. Everything you need is your imagination. "And what imagination accepted as a beautiful ... "Must be true ... "Be it ever existed or not. " John Keats wrote it ... In a letter to their parents 1818th Is that what you mean, Catherine? You should be give in this class. heart asks for pleasure first. We have to see. Urgent Do not you like to look for me to see. Some continue to stay Our arrangement for riding.

He lost a partner to hunt. I thought you might like ... to go out with me to hunt birds. I heard that you are very good. And I heard the same about you. So? You little nervous. Relax. They will come at any moment. I have never chased more than we need. And you? - No. Absolutely not. That's good. I'm too old ... to kill only for murder. It aggravates me no more satisfaction. Someone told me you saw a coyote ... down in the vicinity of Ferry Road. No. I thought the coyote but it is not. He was too big. It was a wolf, and I will catch that bastard. I thought not to kill animals just for fun. Well, let's take the example of coyote. These are interesting animals, Very clever. Did you know that they can steal your nose ... chicken, pig, hamster, or pet - just like that! And disappear before you become aware! They deserve to be killed. They are independent and determined.

Although, I think it would be good ... when they could freely talk to you. To talk with me? What? Have not you noticed that is depressed? I mean, I was upset because of you and Joseph. Catherine, I think it none of your business! Yes. Robert is my friend. I'm sorry. I do not want to create problems. Sorry! You know, I like Catherine. Full of sparks. Robert is fun with it.

I can not get married with you ... and the rest of my life I Orinov spirit. Fuck Orinov spirit. Orin is dead, and I'm alive. I live three miles along the way ... I wonder why I wasted life of the damned mad. It is now 2:00 in the morning. Please leave before you wake up Lily. You will not you let it remain here, right? You want to bring blanket, please? Robert, please Bring a blanket? I want to go here. He's a liar. I feel like a fool ... Like I was the subject of a joke or something like that. Believe me, no one laughs. He's just a liar .... Catherine was bored and she wanted sex ... and a man lost his head. He will get over it, same as you. That's not true. Catherine is a wonderful person. He seduced her. Robert, you are still ignorant boy. I do not know anything about women. I know more than you think. She is my friend. I'm with her. Oh, strong thing. Jesus. Thus, Catherine is a young and beautiful ... comes from unhappy family ... and they make love. Why people can not make love ... without all those damn evil? These are just nonsense. How the hell you know what I feel? This was a tough test for both, right? What can I tell you, son? What do you know about my father? Your father? He was better at everything from me, except for fishing. He loved to fight with fists, I was good at it. Did you like it? I thought it was the greatest. He was my best friend. Why he went to war? He was not invited. You think, why he left You and your mother? You want the truth? Here he was bored. I want to warn you. What do you warn me? Major knows. I think that coming to see you. Stop! Joseph, what are you doing? Are you armed? No. Jesus. Why should I be armed? Who is that in the jeep? My wife. We whether to enter? Of course. You want to sit down and something to drink? Yes, thank you. That all I wanted. Thank you. I wanted to talk about fishing. I see that you are shaking hands. Catherine said she will to marry her. Is this true? No. No, no. It would be stupid. I'm not her type. What is her type? Someone who is rich and knowledgeable. Someone who is a refined ... living in urban areas, and closer to the her age. I wanted to know I'm not a fool ... I do not like me real fool. We moved here ... partly to the shelter of these types of people. But Catherine is closed half with very good success. perhaps its best so far. I do not know what life you lead ... but I guess not experienced in these matters. No, I think not. This was my first time to do so. I could not help myself, Even when I knew it was wrong. And I think you're wrong. But I can only you to blame, because knowing Catherine ... I believe that less than half of that idea was yours. I can not tell you what is going on in her mind. You are polite, know this. Just know that you should not try to marry her. You alone are more abused than someone who has used his advantage. Mr. Svenden, did you know that I know ... you're asleep with my daughter? Beverly ... Honey, are you listening? Shut up. - Mrs. ... Beverly, come on, baby. Let's go home. It was a long day. I'm tired, and you're tired. We'll talk again. Let's just in the car. I am waiting, sir Svenden. Beverly, it's time to go. Bastard. It's okay. Come on. How did you come here? - Robert took me. Where is he? - He's gone. Dad said that he would talk to you. Well, I talked it, like your mother. Dad said that you never would not have married me ... and I just izigravala fool. That's not true, right? Because it can not be true. I mean, do not you you see that I give you ... best year of my life? It sucks. What would you do it this year, fucked up with Robert? See what I am done with his life. And we do not know the even a full year. Again play the role! Catherine. We care a lot for each other. We spent together memorable moments. But I'm damn old man ... and you're beautiful, you're brilliant ... and have seventeen years. I thought you loved me. I love you enough to know what is best for you. No. You are what you is good for me. Come on, let's just .. Can not we just be lovers as we were in the beginning? I bet they would not be married for me that I asked. You're using me ... While you were out of town. That's fine. I did something wrong. What? Look! Jesus. What are the hell did they make? Bolo. Bolo. You ... are you okay? Oh, dear. Why did you do? I was angry at you. So there you have burned so your horse? I was expecting you to it save her ... but did not. Come on. Come on. I will take you home .. I heard what happened last night. Nothing is left of the barn? It is not. Completely disappeared. It's strange, but ... I think that I have overturned ... potcenjuci and all these years, but ... Do you know why I liked Catherine ... except, of course, because her body? Because it is not even a person. You do not have to give her none of them. She does not even know that you gave her ... if you gave her. Maybe so. I do not know. I do not have some justification. I think I wanted to lose my head ... but it certainly did not want ... When Catherine and I have started. This is what I was raised. Then we had that night, when we were swept passion ... For the first time of our youth. We worked a little, and in fact we did not know ... what we do before we did. And I want to to be in ecstasy. I love you, Rosalie! Ever. Joseph! Joseph, come on! Come!
