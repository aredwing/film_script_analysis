I mean, every year since our moms met in the hospital, We've done something new and special, But this has to be newer and more special. So what's something we've never done before? - Mushrooms? - No, not like that. Like something nice. - Like maybe a trip. - Like a mushroom trip? No. Sorry, Sue. I have a date. So do I. Sorry, Sue. Don't worry, Sue. We'll figure it out. - Oh, flowers. Are these from you? - Yeah. Sure. Here you go. No card? But I thought I saw one. I didn't know how to put my feelings into words. I guess, um... You still make me... Nervous. Oh, Jake. Maybe I should come in and hang out for a minute. Uh, no, Jake. Not yet. When we do it, I want it to be really special, - The best night of my life. - It will be, I promise. It'll always be amazing. With you and me together. Jake, no. I have to go. I have to work on my art project. You know, I thought art was gonna be a really easy elective, But guess I should have taken more math. Heh. Uh, so you're gonna come to my birthday, okay? - This saturday? - Of course. Thanks. Okay, bye. Not bad. - Hello. - Cheryl, we have to talk about our birthday plans. I mean, it's only two days away, and we still haven't decided the perfect way to celebrate. So I was thinking maybe we could all take a trip to... Oh, Sue, um, I meant to tell you before, But I wanted to be sure. Um, I think I'm gonna spend my birthday with jake. Uh, I'm gonna lose my virginity to him. You know, I want to surprise him. What? But you can't. I mean, I thought we were going to wait until marriage. Besides, you can't do that to us. You can't break tradition that way. This is bad. You know, I'm gonna tell Lexi. She's gonna be very unhappy about this. Come on, Lexi. Oh, baby, you're so hot. - I'm gonna do you so good. - Oh, yeah, baby? - Yeah. - What was your name again? Rod, sex god. That's right. That's the body of a real man. Oh, sorry. I just gotta get my phone. Oh, it's an sos from Sue. Hold on. My contacts. Go time. No. Wait. I need to find my contacts. They're in here somewhere. - Oh, there's one. - Nipple. - Sorry. - I didn't say stop, though. Hit them both. Oh, hey. It's my buddy JJ. Is that cool? Oh. Uh, uh... okay. I guess. As long as you told him I'm still a virgin, So no fucking. Oh. Oh. Lexi is so upset, she's speechless. Yeah, right. I bet. Oh, my gosh. Bye. Oh, my gosh. Five orgasms in a row. Oh, there's my contact. Cheryl's losing her virginity on saturday? Oh, no. Does not compute. Want to talk... - In person... - Asap. - Oh. - Huh. I Hi. So when did you get home? - So is it true? - Yes, it is. It's just it's the right time, And jake's the right man. I mean, he's handsome and smart and wealthy, And he has a really bright future ahead of him, So I just think it's the right time. Lexi, tell her. Losing our virginity is one of those milestones. We all have to face together. On our birthday, yes, but not on this birthday. Like maybe on our 23rd birthday Or maybe even like our twenty... Ni... Eighth, maybe. Listen, guys, um, I know it's tradition, but sorry. But, Cheryl, sue is right. We do always do something special on our birthda... Does Jake really have Such a tiny, little needle dick? It's not Jake. It's the male ideal, Like a greek god or sue's dad. Right. Yeah, I guess you're right. I mean, it kinda sucks. I'm not really an artist. Girls, can you just stop changing the subject? The point is we should all lose our virginities together... on the same day, and I'm just not ready yet. I'm waiting for a sign, and then I'll know it's right. Look, I can go either way. I mean, I'm fine with just 69, 79, anal. I don't feel any rush to actually do the deed. Besides, I know it'll never live up to my rabbit anyway. But if you want to do it this year, then... ...maybe we all should. You know, it could be like our big 18th birthday thing. Where are you going? It's 6:30 in the morning. To church to pray for you. Want to be first in line. Well, I'm getting some sleep. Yeah, me, too. Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. It has been four days since my last confession. I accuse myself of the following sins... Mm... Hmm. Okay, so I... I'm really embarrassed to talk about this, but... It's about sex. Uh... Huh. I mean, not me. I've... I've never gone past second base with a guy. Uh... Huh. I... I've never even seen a guy's... Well, there was that one time I took the pants off my ken doll, But I was dressing him up as Jesus, and I... I wanted to see his thing, But there was nothing there. Okay, so it's about my friends, My best friends. They're gonna do something really bad this weekend. Okay. Third base. What? No, like sex. Like intercourse. With boys they barely even know. I mean, they really need a sinnervention, if you know what I mean. All the way. Go all the way. What are do... How could you do s... You're a bad, bad person. What? Yes. Yes! Run! Run! H... Home ru... Damn it. Fucking yankees. Sorry. Sue, it is one p.m. Would you have a little consideration? I'm trying to sleep. Jeez, can you guys please keep it down? I have an announcement to make. I want to do it. Do you hear me? I want to do it. This weekend on our birthday. Do what? It, screw. You know, screwing, boning, making beast with two backs. You know, shagging, Fucking! You do? Uh, but what about all your religious stuff, and, um, what about your sign from heaven? - Oh, I got a sign at church. - Really? Well, okay, great. We're all in then. So we'll have a big pool party, and we'll do it there, right? Right. I'll start making the shopping list. I wonder what Jake's gonna get me for my birthday? Maybe it's a ring. Or maybe it's like a rescue puppy. Oh. It'll be like the start of our new family. Hey, check it out. So gross. Uh, but you better put that away before sue sees it. She'll have a heart attack. Uh, Lexi, your bra, it has no cups. Yeah. Hence the term cupless bra. I don't know. Do you think it's hot enough? No. I think it's ridiculous. It's like an oxymoron, like hairless wig or fingerless gloves... - Mm, is it hot enough? - Or nonstick glue. Or like crotchless panties. Oh, right. Thank you for reminding me. Party favors! Oh. Well! That's so wrong. I know. Horrible. Doesn't vibrate. It's broken. It's okay, though. I have another one. What? You prefer that? Well, which is it, Sue, manual or automatic? Wait. You mean... Are you saying... You've never masturbated? - No. - Like no, never? - No, never. - Seriously, like never ever? - No. - Uh, like never even in your sleep? Or when you're bored? Or when you're just anxious? Like in the morning to help you wake up? Or at night to help you fall asleep? Or when you think about Jake and my's new puppy? Yeah. Or when you go to visit. Your dead brother's grave? Or when you witness a murder? Or when you put on lipstick and it gets on your teeth? Or when you start going sky diving? Or when you max out all your credit cards? Or when you play jigsaw with your grandmother? - Or just because? - Because you're really fucking horny? No, never. Like never, ever, ever, ever, ever. - But seriously, never? - Never. Look, can we just drop it? We have a whole house to decorate. Yeah, okay. I just still can't get over it. - Hey, Frank. - Oh. Hi, Sue. Guys, we didn't invite frank to the party. I don't know. Do you think he'd even have fun? Yeah. He's blind. Blind people can do everything regular people can do. He's not waving back. Frank. Hey. Um, I was wondering. Well, the house looks done. Tomorrow's the big day. We finally turn 18. And finally lose our virginity. Well, we better get our beauty sleep, because the party starts tomorrow at 2:00. So, okay, we know who Cheryl's gonna do it with, Jake. And I'll probably do that guy Rod. But, Sue, who are you gonna pick to pop your Cherry? It's easy. I've known for the past six years, ever since catechism. What the fuck is catechism? I think it's a baby panda wrapped in peanut butter. Oh, my soul mate. Chris? Sue, you, um, might want to think about picking a backup. - I mean... - What? No. Chris is perfect. He played Jesus in Jesus Christ superstar last year at camp. Plus his name is Chris. It's a sign. Sue, the only sign is that Chris. Has a major case of gay face. What? He does not. Anyway, there's no such thing as gay face. He looks just like Justin Bieber. With a little bit of Zac Efron. And just a hint of Ryan Seacrest. Who the fuck's Ryan Seacrest? Look, Chris is my soul mate. Okay, well, sweet dreams. See you in the morning. I knew it would happen someday. I just didn't expect it to happen so soon. You're so perfect. I knew that's what it looked like. Too bad no one could ever compare to you. Wow. You are perfect. Who are you? Tomorrow's the day. Oh, my gosh. They're coming. Lexi! Cheryl! Hurry! Eww. Why? It's for jake to unwrap me. It's gonna be really sexy. I'm gonna surprise him. You're gonna die of asphyxiation. It's gonna be really sexy. It's stupid. Just screw him. That's what he wants. That's what all guys want. - Who hurt you as a child? - Oh, Christ. Can I wrap your mouth, too? Anyway, what guys want. Is someone who's sexy, Not someone they can just have sex with. You're an idiot, A very smooth, plastic... Wrapped idiot. - Thank you. - Guys, seriously. Come on. Hurry up. Oh. Oh, what a cool bracelet. I love it. Um... You should put that down, though, 'cause it's like... It's very fragile. - Yeah. - Okay. - Set it down. - Yeah. - Hurry up. - Morning. Those were your anal beads, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, I thought so. Oh, this party's hot. Whoa. Hold up. - Oh, we gonna Have some fun. - Oh, attack of the wet t... shirts. Nice.

Do my lips look any plumper? I put the stuff on, but I can't really feel anything yet. Have you guys seen Jake? I haven't seen him anywhere. He just, like, disappeared. Are these real? Of course they are. - I'm just wondering. - How come I've never met you before? I don't know. Maybe you just don't be around. Darryl, have you seen Jake? Um, I think he's around or something. Maybe upstairs. I don't know. - So... - So... Maybe he went to go get... ...my birthday present. That's probably where he went. Whoa, whoa. - Liquid courage? - Yeah. Attagirl. - Vodka cranberry? - Shirley temple. Well, I guess it's now or never. I gotta go meet Rod. Sue? Are you okay? Sue, relax. They're just guys, okay? Nothing to be scared of, seriously. You're gonna be fine. Is chris here? Wow. It's even worse in person, isn't it? No. He does not have gay face. I'm gonna prove it to you. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do this. Good luck. Oh, god. Hey, you can do this. Just act like a slut. Just pretend you're Lexi. My favorite chapter is sodom and gomorrah. Chris. Hi. - Can I talk to you? - Uh... huh. Uh, in private. Oh, be Lexi. You're Lexi. - What? - Chris. You're so sexy. Ever since you played Jesus at camp, I've just... I've known that we. Were meant to be together, and I really want to... Oh! What are you doing? - Is that wrong? - Sue! What's gotten into you? Nothing. I'm... I'm sorry. I... I don't know how to do this. Sue. Sue, Sue, Sue. I understand these urges, and, you know, I like you, too. - Really? You do? - I do. I really do. It's just... I've devoted a lot of my life to one certain man. Right. - Lexi said you were... - Jesus. Oh. That man. Of course. What did you think? Uh, nothing. - So we can still do this, then? - Oh, Sue. You know, for me... When I think about that man, who died for our sins, when I think about him. Up there on that cross so helpless, yet so muscular, with his strong thighs. Crossed over each other. So delicately. Beneath that ragged loincloth, Growing so hot, so sweaty. Under that hot, hot sun, I just feel such compassion. I think about those things, too. So you understand why I can't do this. Not really. I just find it too hard... it is... to give in to carnal pleasure. When he sacrificed so much for us, So... Gonna go out there, right? And then we're gonna totally throw these ones. - They're gonna hit... - Hey, guys. I Whoa! - Have you seen Jake? - Uh, n... no. No. All right. Okay. All right, focus. Focus. Focus. Oh, there he is. Oh, he got me the puppy that I wanted. How could he? Sue, what happened? Did you guys do it? Sue. He doesn't want me. - Because he's gay. - No, he's not. He just really loves Jesus. Oh, come on, Sue. The only reason you even liked him. Is because you knew he was never a real possibility for you. Look, the only way you are gonna find out. What kind of man you really want. Is to know what kind of woman you really are deep inside. - What? - Come with me. - Where? - To meet your dark side. Out! Everyone out! Sue, it's time for you and your vagina. To meet face to face. No. I really can't. I really don't think I can do this. I'm not letting you out until you look. Sue... can you see it? Sue. I'm almost... I'm almost there. Oh. What? What? Sue, what happened? What did you see? - A raccoon? - What? You overshot it. Aim the mirror further up. I can't. Please don't make me do that again. Okay, fine. Fine. I didn't want to do this, but you leave me no choice. - What? - You really need an orgasm. Honestly, I don't know how you expected. To ever have sex with someone else. When you've never even had it with yourself. This really has to be your first step. - Lex, I'm ready. - Coming. Sue, uh, my black vibrator. Is somewhere in the top drawer. Just find it and use it. Well, wait. What does the black vibrator look like? It's black. It vibrates. - Come on, Rod. Let's go to sue's room. - Okay. And don't come back until you have at least one orgasm. Hey, cutie! Cutie! Boobs... eye! Ah, yeah! Beg. Beg. Bang. Bang. Good boy. Straighten up. Good boy. Good boy. He knows over a hundred commands. I'm sorry. I can't see anything. - That is not funny, Cheryl. - That bitch. Fortunately when you're blind, you get used to things like that. Oh. Oh shit What's wrong with this thing? Cheryl, what is wrong? Lexi, it's Jake. He was getting a blow job by some pink... haired girl. For sure? I mean, I know I've been putting off having sex with him, so maybe... maybe it's my fault. That's no excuse. He's a dirtbag. How dare he? I know. It's awful. I mean, I thought I was gonna marry him. Oh, no. Oh, my god. It's a text. It's from him. Um, I can't bear myself to read it. Okay. Uh, he's looking for you. He wants to give you your birthday gift. Oh, I can't face him. - Um, I have to go. I'm going. - No. You can't just leave. Well, I can't stay and just pretend like nothing happened. I mean, maybe I should confront him. No. He'll either deny it. Or admit and promise never to do it again. Either way, it's bullshit. I see only one option. - I'm leaving. - Revenge sex. Rev... I mean, what? What does that even mean? It means you find a guy, you screw his brains out. And you let jake catch you. But he... I mean, He doesn't even care. He doesn't even care about me. I mean, why would... He's just into other girls. Trust me. He'll care. Seriously, this is the worst thing you could do to him, to his ego, to screw someone else. When you've never even had sex with him, Especially if it's with someone smarter, Better... Looking. And with a bigger dick. No, I... I couldn't. Plus, I mean, there's... there's no one smarter... a... and better... Looking. Eric. He's perfect. Eric Hall? Are you kidding? I mean, he wouldn't even be into me. He likes your type. Really? And what type is that? Slutty. Yeah. Trust me. He's amazing. I fooled around with him once. He has this great tongue ring. Oh. No. I could never fool around. With somebody you've fooled around with. Okay, then. Fine. We will find someone else, someone that I haven't fooled around with. I don't... Okay, what does it matter. That I fooled around with him? I mean, it's... you're not gonna marry the guy. Mmm. No, I just couldn't do it. Fine. If you want to live the rest of your life. Knowing that you had one chance to do the right thing. To make your boyfriend feel. Like a total worthless piece of garbage. And possibly even scar him for the rest of his existence. And you chose not to do it, go ahead. But honestly, I don't know how you'll be able to live with yourself. I don't know. Trust me. It's going to work. Okay, I will intercept Jake. And get him upstairs. - Hi, Cheryl. Happy birthday. - Okay, enough chitchat. - Hey, I was... - Fuck no! Hey. Happy birthday. Thanks. - Have you guys seen Jake? - No? So... Happy birthday. Uh, do you know that most people think. That the happy birthday song was from britain? But it's actually from us. U.s. A... America. - United states. - I know where we live. Right. Of course. Okay, Jesus, Eric. Are you gonna make your move or not? Oh, you want me to move? Yeah. No, I can totally move. I just... I... No. You're fine. Oh. Jake! So, Eric, do you want to do it or not? I'm sorry. It? - What, um... - It... like monkey... boning. And, like, pigs in a blanket, Get real nasty. Oh. Oh, you mean like, uh... Right now? I mean, well, yeah. You know, the sooner the better, Yeah. Sure. I mean, yeah. Of course. Um, I just never realized that you... I mean... Whew. Uh... It's just... You're so... - You're so beautiful and... - Okay, um... Uh, no kissing. Right. Um, of course. Sorry? So, um, do you want to unwrap me? Oh, wow. Uh, you're wrapped up. Like a hot pocket or... a leftover macaroni and cheese. Not that you're left over. You're not. Y... You're fresh. Organic. Yep. - So the wrap. - Right. Where's the, uh... It's, uh... the edge is, like, right over here. - Oh, oh. Yeah. Here it is. It's... I see it. - Yeah.

Hey, Cheryl, are you okay? Oh, jeez. Well, that was stupid. Yeah. How you doing tonight? You having a good time? Yeah? Good. - Jake, I think I saw Cheryl upstairs. - What? I can't hear you. Need another beer. - Chips are so damn salty. - Jake! - So anyway... - Upstairs! - Yeah. - Hold on. Gotta take a piss. Too much beer. Finally. I, uh... set me just get the blinds. Oh, oh. No, no, no. No, no, no. - Um, don't... don't worry about it. - What? I mean, I want us to be able to see each other. Oh. - Well, okay. - Okay. You like that, baby, huh? What are you doing?

Lockjaw. - Is that even a thing? I don't know. Are you okay? N... No, no, no. It's, uh... It's fine. I'm just e... embarrassed. It's probably TMJ. Or fracture, swollen... You sure you're okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. - Okay, great. Have fun. - Oh! - Now. Now. Let's do it now, now. - No, not yet. Not yet. I'm gonna come. - No. Not yet. - I'm gonna come. Are you ready? No! No! No, no, no!...

I'm blind. Damn it. I'm gonna say something to that bitch. Hey, you. You better stop making fun of the blind, Or I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'm so sorry. I'll never make fun of the blind again. God These water balloons, They feel so real. - They are real, bitch. - I'm sorry. Freak. This just isn't working out. Oh, man. No more water balloons. This party's ass. Yeah, yeah...

Yeah. I just needed to, Oh. Sure. Listen, Sue, I... I was rethinking what I said earlier. You were? You mean... Yeah. So you think we should give it a try? Could we go get a drink? Wow. Um, your toilet's really... Clogged. You sh... You know what? I... I gotta go. - Um, happy birthday. - Un, no, Chris! No! That wasn't... I didn't... God, never mind. This was the worst idea ever. I'm never going to have sex. Ow. Hello. A little attention here. Oh, yeah. Sorry. - Lex, don't be selfish. - Oh, right. Sorry. Jeez. Who invented this stupid position anyway? Too much fucking multitasking. Screw it. Let's just do it. This is it. What is it? Uh, I can't... Seem to get it in. Ow! - Don't force it, please. - Sorry. Thank you. We were so hot last week. What the hell is different? What? Why did this happen? Well, JJ was there last time. Oh, yeah. JJ. Oh, no. Oh, no. Could it be that I've become such a slut... that I need a threesome to even get excited? I've used up all my juices. I've gone dry, like a used... up orange. So is, uh, JJ here tonight? Not that I know of. It doesn't matter. We don't need a third party. We are gonna do this. We just need a little... Here. I got this edible massage oil. You can use it as a lube. All right. What the... Oh, my god! What the fuck is that? Holy shit! Oh! This is the hot lip gloss. No wonder my lips weren't plumping. Oh. Oh. Ahh. That does burn. No. Oh. That was bad. That was so bad. Joanna, do you know a guy named JJ? I think that guy's name starts with a "J." Hey, does your name start with a "J"? Yes, it does. So you're JJ? Hello. Welcome to 1... 800... Confess. Would you like a priest or a nun today? A nun. Please punch in your credit card number. Please hold. Oh, thank goodness. 1... 900... Confession. How may I be of service? It's been one day since my last confession. I accuse myself of the following sins... One day. Uh, is that too long? I would have come this morning, but it's my 18th birthday. Go on. Uh, okay. Well, I've been touching myself. Inappropriately. Well, actually, I didn't. A washing machine did. What's her problem? A washing machine touched her. Uh, well, you know, I sat on a washing machine, and, well... All right, freak. Time's up. What? But what do I do? Just unplug the thing. No, but... but I think I might have had an... Orgasm. Well, then be happy you found the perfect man. I'm serious. Look, honey, you seem like a nice young lady so... I'll tell you this. Masturbation isn't a sin. No contritions? You broke no covenant with god. It's not in the bible. So the washing machine could touch me anytime? Like morning, afternoon, night? Yes, and other things can touch you. Accidental masturbation is not a sin. Neither is intentional masturbation. - God's pretty cool that way. - He sure is. Now run along. Wow. How do you know all that? Because I'm a nun. Now eat my pussy, bitch! Accidental masturbation. Who'd have thunk? Revenge sex. What a stupid fucking idea. God, I'm getting out of here. Yeah, I admit it. I got no game. I guess I just get a little nervous around beautiful women like you. Fucking douche... bag. Damn it. Now I have to get laid if it's the last thing I do. You go, girl. What? What are you doing here? We needed someplace private. But, hey, listen. If you're serious about getting laid... - Yeah. - If you want someone great... I mean really the best ever... No offense. - Frank, the blind guy. - Really? I'm telling you. He's amazing. I had food sex with him a few weeks ago. It was like nothing I've ever experienced before. It was like we used all our senses, everything. If you're interested, I'll set it up. All right. What about him, Jeremy? I know Jeremy. I think I fooled around with him once. I don't know his last name, though. It's Jones, Jeremy Jones. This all makes sense. Excuse me. Jeremy. - Hi. - Hey. Who was on the phone? Oh, that's my new girlfriend. You'll meet her. - She'll be here in, like, an hour. - Wait. You have a girlfriend? Oh. Hi, Frank. Sit. Oh, you meant... You meant the dog. Relax. Need to relax and calm down. Oh, I'm... I'm relaxed. I'm fine. Then why are you biting your nail? I'm not. How did you know that? Corner. Sit. Roll over. Oh, you mean me. Oh, how do you... how do you want me to... Just lay down. - Oh.
