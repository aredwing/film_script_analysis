" But there's also a flip side to that. Sometimes you can take a wrong turn and find yourself on the most God-awful stretch of road imaginable, spinning your wheels, praying it's not a dead end. How you doing back there, Joshua? I'm in too much pain to be dead. -How you hanging in there, boss? -I'm all right. I've Iost more blood from a bad shave. Damn. I think one of my Iungs just collapsed. That's all right. You only need one. My old man Iost a Iung to Joe Camel when he was 53 years old, and he Iived to be 67. Still running a pack a day through the other Iung. Of course, out of spite, he switched to Marlboro. I'm dying, Vincent. Hey! That is bullshit. I don't Iet you die. I told you I was Ieaving. AII right, you gotta stay with me. We're half an hour from the doc's house. I'II have us there in 20 minutes. Love, honor, power, fear of death, people live for all kinds of reasons. Some are more noble than others. When all you have to live for is revenge, it can really bone your quality of life. Come on in, Donnie. I don't see why we have to talk in the garage when I've got a perfectly nice house. Why don't I... Get in there! Donnie. Stop being such a pussy, huh? -Hey, Mickey. -What? Try to maintain some Ievel of professionalism. -What are you talking about? -The pushing, the name-calling, -it's not necessary. -Hey, I'm sorry, Donnie. See, I thought that we work for this big crime boss and we're here to collect some money for him, but obviously we're a couple of Avon Iadies. See, that's what I'm talking about. Not everything's black and white. -I mean, Donnie here's a good guy. -Get over there. But this isn't a social call, is it, Donnie? This is business. This is nothing personal. We're here to collect the money or impose a penalty. There's no need to add insult to injury, now, is there? No. Joshua, what kind of injury are we talking about? So you don't have Vincent's money. -Well, not all of it. -Well, how much do you have? None of it. Donnie. You put me in a very bad place. PIease, have a seat. -You don't have to do this. -It's for your own safety. -What? -Hold him. No! Come on, Joshua. Can't you tell Vincent I wasn't home? Tell him I'm out of town on business or something. You want me to Iie to Vincent? Betray his trust because you can't stay away from the ponies? I can have the dough next week! Vincent's been more than patient with you. -Now he wants his pound of flesh. -Hey! Maybe we take his thumbs off. No, nothing permanent. What are you talking about? They can reattach them these days. Hey, I think I found something. How about we give him a Iittle snip-snip Bobbitt? Yeah, then there'd be two Ioose pricks in the room. -That's funny? -A Iittle bit. I've got a joke for you, and it starts Iike this. That's enough, Mickey. Grab that stool and prop his Iegs up. -What? -Take his shoes off. -Get your fucking feet up. -The socks, too. Get your feet up here, you fuck. -Why? Don't! Why? -Shut the fuck up! -Grab his Iegs. -What? Why? Joshua. PIease. No! PIease! Joshua, please, no! Don't you find it ironic, Mickey, that the black culture has become so influential in this country that even the Italians are trying to identify with it? What the fuck are you talking about? If your grandfather knew that you had a Iifetime membership to the tanning salon... Tanning salon? You're out of your fucking mind. This is natural. This is my natural color. Orange. That's your natural color, orange? Orange? Do I Iook orange to you? This is olive. -Which one? The green or the black? -The green and the black. -Who is it? -It's Joshua. -Password, please. -You're a douche! That's the password. Hey, why the fuck do you... Come on! Who is it? -Jeff, it's me, Joshua. -Bullshit. Joshua knows the password. Majestic 1 2, Jeff. "Majestic 1 2, Majestic 1 2." What a fucking snatch. What the fuck is Majestic 1 2? It's a secret committee formed in the '40s to investigate UFOs. -You believe that shit? -There are two kinds of truths, Mickey. There's the obvious truth. The sky is blue. The grass is green. You're a dick. And then there's the intangible. The kind that requires one's faith to be true. Can't be conclusively proven or refuted. This is the truth of religion and conspiracy theories. My faith in God mandates that I stay open-minded to all truths. Otherwise I risk becoming a hypocrite, and that ain't cool. Hey. Come in. -How you doing, buddy? -Okay. -Wow. New wallpaper? -It's aluminum foil. It's nice. I gotta get the number of your interior decorator. Can I get you guys something to drink? I have triple-filtered water, no fluoride. Triple-filtered water, huh? Nah. What was it about Vincent you wanted to tell me? You've heard of Frankie Tahoe, right? -Why don't you tell me about him? -Hey, Jeff. Did you really get abducted by aliens? -Yeah, I was. -Wow. That's fucking crazy. Can you put those down, please? -These? -PIease. -Mickey, put them down. -Okay. Thank you. Okay, Frankie Tahoe is this Puerto Rican small-time punk. Drug dealer, right? And he knows I'm good friends with Vincent. AII of a sudden he starts asking me all kinds of shit. "Where does he Iive? How many guys he got?" Okay? But I didn't... I didn't... I didn't tell him nothing. I swear to God. Look what he did to me. Stop messing with this stuff. This is cute. See, now, I'm ignorant on the whole abduction thing, you know what I'm saying? So, is it true that when they bring you up in their spaceship, that they roll around your fucking prostate and your anal? -They get in there? -Yeah, that's part of the exam. Why the fuck would they put it in your ass? I don't understand. There's things they want to find out about us human beings, you know. -Through your ass? -Yeah. Body temperature, you know? Parasites. I know, I know. But I'm gonna be there this time. I will. Okay. Okay. You know what I think? I think that all the aliens must be fucking gay and they just want to shove it right in your corn, you know what I mean? They just want to come down here and abuse humans and fucking give it to you right in your ass. Is that true? Do you refuse to believe 'cause you believe this to be impossible? Or maybe it's just impossible for your Iimited wit to comprehend. Excuse me. You know, that's a good point. You know, my Iimited wit might... Might stop me from believing that aliens don't fuck you in your fucking ass! -Now Iisten to me. Listen to me! -Get off of me. -Look at me, Iook at me! -Joshua! -Get off my... -Fuck! Put your fucking arms down. Put your fucking arms down, now! -Okay, okay. They're down. -Okay, thank you. -Thank you. -Why didn't you go to Vincent directly? -Why come to me? -'Cause you know how he would get if he saw what they did to me. You're his main guy, right? Do what you gotta do to this Iying piece of shit. Wait! Wait. Okay. Wait. Stop! Joshua! -Hey, what the fuck? -Stop, stop. Okay, okay, okay, okay. -Okay, see? -Okay, okay. Joshua, all I was trying to do is make a few bucks selling his stuff, and he starts talking to me about all this shit! Just don't tell Vincent, please. He'II be so fucking mad at me. I am telling you the truth now. I swear to God. -You better be, you fucking junkie. -Fuck! -Vincent. -Come on in. Sorry to wake you. I thought it might be important. Actually, I wasn't sleeping. I was fucking, and if you think it's important then it probably is. Joshua, I want to thank you for having the good sense and courtesy to remove your shoes, so as not to track in the filth of the outside world. Take your shoes off, Mickey. Shit, I'm sorry. The good news is, I didn't track anything in. Can you detect things that exist on a microscopic Ievel? In the future, when you come to my home, I want you to take off your shoes. I don't want to tell you again, 'cause if I do, you won't need shoes anyway, 'cause I'II cut off your fucking feet. -Got it, Vince. -Vincent. Say my whole name or don't say it at all, please. Yes, sir, Vincent. Let's sit down, shall we? Well? Apparently, a cat by the name of Frankie Tahoe wants you dead. That's not exactly what you want to hear at 1 :00 in the morning. Is there any time of day you want to hear that shit? Who the fuck is Frankie Tahoe, and where'd you hear this? He's a Puerto Rican drug dealer. Jeff told me. Why didn't Jeff call me himself? -Vincent? -Yeah, baby. -Did you offer the boys any coffee? -No. -Why not? -'Cause they don't want any. Well, how do you know that if you didn't offer? Because when they're working for me I make decisions for them, and I've decided they don't want any fucking coffee. Jesus Christ, you are the worst host. -Would you please watch your mouth? -Look who's talking. Do not take the name of my savior in vain. You know, you wouldn't even offer him a cup of coffee. He doesn't drink coffee. Would you please do me a favor and go back to bed? I'II be up in a minute. Go back to bed. Like what you're seeing, Mick? What? Come on. There's a... I mean, she's beautiful, but... -I would never do that. -Go wait outside. -It's fucking freezing outside. -Get the fuck out of here. So, Jeff's been selling this dude's dope on the side. Okay, that's why he didn't call me. What do you make of it? It's not the first drug dealer that wanted you dead. -Yeah. -But I don't know that I trust Jeff. He's from my old neighborhood. I trust him. -Guy thinks he was abducted by aliens... -I know, I know. AII right, here's what I want you to do. Find out exactly where this guy is right now. I'm gonna go get dressed. Hey, Vincent? There is one other thing. What is it? What's the problem? You need money? What is it? -No, no. It's not that. -Where do you think you're going? I'm going to Disneyland. It's 3:00 in the morning. Isn't that when everybody goes to Disneyland? -Give me a fucking break. -What a smartass. And you know what? I don't Iike you talking to me Iike that. AII right, all right, all right. We'II talk about it Iater. Hey. -Jeffrey, how's things? -They're fine. They're great, Vincent. -So, how's Katie? -What? -Katie? How is she? -She's good, yeah. She's starting high school soon. We're gonna take care of her, you know that, right? -You get enough visitation? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, Jeff, tell me about this Puerto Rican. Frankie. Yeah, Frankie Tahoe. You in trouble with this guy or something? Why? Look at me. I need to be 1000/0 sure that what you're telling me is on the Ievel. Yeah, Vincent. I wouldn't Iie to you. You know that. -He do this to your face? -Yeah. -I wouldn't tell him nothing. -Okay. No, Vincent. No. You don't have to sell dope for these scumbags. You need money, you come to me. I know. I know. Thanks, Vincent. Sorry, Vincent. Jeffrey. This is fucking unbelievable. This fucking guy. Fucking respects him more than he respects me. -This guy's a fucking Iowlife junkie. -He's got history with this cat. -Come here! -Fuck! Shit. -Where's your piece? -Easy. It's cute. My grandmother's got one just Iike it. -You know who I am? -Yeah. -You know why I'm here? -No. Interesting. How Iong have you worked for Mr. Tahoe? A few months. Now, here's the most important question. In that time, do you think you've developed a relationship worth dying for? No. Fuck that. Good answer. -Give me your driver's Iicense. -What? Fuck. Easy, big boy. Easy. Looks Iike you've Iost some weight, Gregory. Yeah, I've been cutting back on the carbs. What the fuck, man? -Put your hands behind your back, B. -For your own safety. -Okay, well, in that case, all right. -Yeah, good. Yeah, I'II play with you guys for a Iittle while. -Turn that music down. -Yes, sir. Okay, we can talk. I got a couple questions for you. That's good, man. 'Cause I got a couple questions for you my damn self, you know what I'm saying? First one is, which one of these two Iittle bitches right here gonna give me a Iap dance? Joshua, you wanna give him a Iap dance? Trip, man. Got chocolate over here. -How was that? -Shit. Fuck. That's not really what I had in mind, but... Okay. Okay. Listen, before we begin, I want to give you some advice. When you're dealing with me, there are two things that will always save your ass. Honesty and respect. Now, those are your cigarettes. You mind if I have one? Yeah, yeah, go ahead, man. Help yourself, man. Why don't we all have one, you know what I'm saying? Got a Iight? You're a good Iittle bitch, huh? Lighting him up Iike that. You know, I can't smoke in my own home. My wife won't Iet me. She's 1 10 pounds soaking wet, but she's got the heart of a drill sergeant and the mouth of a sailor. But, fuck, I married her, right? Do what you do, man, you know what I'm saying? I married her, so I have to answer to her. Everybody's gotta answer to somebody. I answer to my wife. I answer to God. Who do you answer to, Franklin? Well, first of all, I don't answer to Franklin. You know what I'm saying? I didn't Iike it much when my mother called me that, and it sure as hell don't sound any sweeter coming from your ass. -Fair enough. -And the whole married thing, too much pussy out there in the world, man, to be married, right, right? You feel me? And God, he went right out the motherfucking door, homie, once I was old enough to think for my damn self. Now, that says a Iot about you. -Is that right? -Yeah, it does. You have a problem with authority. By being an atheist, you reject the existence of the ultimate authority. What the fuck is this? Inquisition? Now Iet me tell you something, man, this is the 20th century, homeboy, you know that, right? I stopped believing in fairytales, man, a Iong time ago. God, Santa CIaus, all that shit went out the motherfucking door, man. Hey, come on, come on, come on, man! Is this really what you Iadies came down here for? Is this what you girls came down here for? Ask some stupid-ass questions? I get it, I get it, I get it. You guys want me to make a donation to the church, right? You really think you can kill me, you piece of shit? What the fuck you talking about, man? You slap my people around. You disrespect my Iord and savior. Hey, hey, my man, is this guy serious? Hey! Talking to you! What's this guy talking about, man? Hey, Iook, hold on, hold on, Iet me just... Let me just think about this for a quick second, all right? What the fuck are you talking about, man? Your people? What are you... Fuck! God damn... I've had enough of your Puerto Rican ass! That shows how fucking stupid you are, white boy! I'm a motherfucking Mexican! What the fuck is this place? Who the fuck is that? Is he the cargo? No, cargo's dead in the trunk. He's with me. -Just one? -Yep. AII right, go straight, to the Ieft. Fuck this guy, huh? Fuck. This guy's fucking heavy. -Straight back. Yeah. -Right here? I swear to God, I think he's breathing! No, I think I'm bugging out. That was fucking scary. Fucking goombah zombies, 'cause I hate that shit. What the... What the fuck? I'm sorry, Mick. This thing's got a hair-trigger. Tell you what, use these to stop the bleeding. Some panties. You should recognize those. You've been in them enough. -What the fuck are you talking about? -This asshole's fucking my wife. Come on, Vincent. Do you think I'm stupid? I think you're stupid enough to Iie to me about it -when you know I know you're Iying. -I'm not Iying to you. Joshua, please. Tell him I'm not Iying to him. I had her followed. They saw him coming out of my house. What the fuck were you doing in my house? -I wasn't in your house. I swear to God. -Hope she rocked your world, Mick. You got me confused with somebody else, Vincent, I swear to God. Joshua, please. We've been together the whole time I've been on this crew. PIease tell him I'm not Iying. I swear to God, on my mother's Iife, -I swear to God, Vincent. -Shut up, Mickey. Vincent? Vincent! I swear to God, on my mother's Iife, I never fucked your wife! I swear to God. AII right, Mickey. I just had to be sure. You scared the shit out of me. Thank you, doll. That's unbelievable. That Iooks even worse than it sounded. It's good for you. You should try it. You're supposed to enjoy what you eat. That shit's got no flavor. It's utility food. Excuse me, more decaf, please. Thank you. You see, that's what I'm talking about. Decaf. What's the point? It's Iike drinking non-alcoholic beer, getting knobbed from some fat chick, it's pointless. You ever had your dick sucked by a fat chick, Vincent? No. Don't knock it till you tried it. Not only are they extremely appreciative Iovers, but they're incredibly talented when it comes to oral gratification. -No shit. -I shit you not, my friend. You see, I would... I would be worried the bitch would get hungry and just start gnawing on the bone, you know? I'm Ieaving, Vincent. What, are you going on a vacation or something? -More Iike retirement. -Retirement. You're gonna retire before me? With what? -With who? -With no one. Are you starting your own crew? How Iong have you been planning this? -This isn't me anymore. -AII right, Iisten. If this is about Mickey, the guy was fucking my wife, okay? What am I supposed to do? What would you do? -It's not just him. -Well, then what? -What about the drug dealer? -What about him? Or the way we came down on that sweatshop three weeks ago. What about it? Or that mark you pulled out of the car on the freeway. What are you saying to me? I Iose it sometimes. What do you want, an apology? What the fuck do you want? You all right, Vincent? No, I'm not all right, Vincent. Fuck you. You owe me. You owe me your Iife, and you're out when I say you're out. I am sick of this shit, Joshua. -When is it going to end? -He killed Mickey tonight. -Oh, Jesus Christ. -Thought you were sleeping with him. Were you? Fuck you, Joshua. Wow, really? Eight points, huh? That's great, buddy. And you packed already? Okay. Me, too. Vincent. Baby, I don't want you to go outside. -I don't want you to go out there. -What? Why don't you call Joshua? Wait for Joshua. Joshua's down the road, okay? Joshua's not here anymore. Joshua's gone. I'm not gonna call Joshua. -Listen to me. I'm fine. -I know. I'm gonna talk to these guys, and I'm gonna come right back. AII right? This coffee sucks. Shit! -What the hell? What the hell was that? -Christ almighty! -You okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. Like I fucking need this... Hey, Paulie, there's no one in the fucking car here. -What? -There's nobody in the car. -What are you talking about? -You all right, fellas? Yeah, we're fine, pal. We got it under control. Thank you. 'Cause, you know, I saw the whole thing. It was clearly the other car's fault. Hey, pal, I think I already told you, we have everything under control. -You got that, right? -Stephen. -No, please, Paulie. -No, no, no, Stephen. You, please, shut the fuck up. -What's the matter? -This is our guy. This guy? How do you know? He has what appears to be a very Iarge weapon sticking in my ribs. Okay. Okay. Come on. You know the deal. We're just the messengers here. Okay, my doorbell works. And if it doesn't, there's a big-ass knocker on the door. When were you two gonna deliver the message? Quite honestly, when our boss called. How's that for timing? Hello? Paulie's busy right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, that's me. No, they were quite obvious. Okay. AII right, I'II see you soon. He wants you to take me to the house. Let's go. -Vincent? -No. Don't worry about it. Go enjoy your retirement. -Let's go, boys. -Get in the car, Vincent. This is Nino Bollino's house. And how do you know that? -Trust me, I know. -Interesting. Come on. I used to work for his father back in the day. He wants to have a Iittle talk. Welcome to the top of the food chain, gentlemen. By the way, naturally we'II have to pat you down. Well, you can certainly try. That's right. Let's have a Iook at that gun you stuck in the back of my head. -Fuck! -You ever seen a compound fracture? 'Cause if you wanna continue this Iittle pissing contest, I could have Joshua rip this fucker's arm off -and beat him with it. -Hey. Just trying to do my job. I understand, but we didn't crash this party. We were invited. So, if your boss doesn't want us to exercise our Second Amendment rights, we'II just be on our way. Joshua? Hey, please. PIease. Yes, sir, Mr. Nino. -I was this close to having you. -Yes, I felt it. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Mr. Nino will see you right now. Jupiter once commanded all the birds of the Earth to appear before him, so that he might choose the most beautiful to be their king. The ugly black crow collected all the colorful feathers which had fallen from the other birds, attached them to his own body and appeared Iooking very beautiful. But the other birds recognized their own plumage and began to strip him. "Stop what you're doing," said Jupiter. "This self-made bird has more sense than any of you. "He shall be your king." -Can I get either of you a drink? -No, thanks. Prendi un prosecco. Have a seat. -There are plenty of chairs. -Thank you, but he prefers to stand. You're a real guard dog, ain't you? You found yourself a pit-bull. -More Ioyal and can be twice as vicious. -I Iike that. Could probably teach some of my guys a few things. Quality over quantity. In some things. -You know, we've met before. -Really? I don't think so. I'd remember a guy Iike you. Well, this was a Iong time ago, before I became a guy Iike me. Your father was Benny Bollino, right? I worked a paper route for him when I was a kid. -Paper route? -Yeah, that's what he used to call it. I ran bribes, picked up extortion money. Shit Iike that. I'II bet it paid better than peddling The Sunday Times. Yeah, yeah. Your father was quite a guy, you know? Loved by his friends, respected by his enemies. To accomplish everything he did and still cross the finish Iine due to natural causes, it's amazing. You think so? My father was a doddering old bag of bones the Iast six years of his Iife. When he wasn't pissing his pants, he was wandering around his house trying to figure out who and where the fuck he was. I kept him propped up on a throne, but I was the one running things. You know what I'm saying, Joshua? And as for crossing the finish Iine of natural causes, at Ieast with a bullet he could have checked out with some fucking dignity. I'm sorry you feel that way. -God rest his soul, I Ioved him. -I'II bet you did. So, tell me, why'd you kill Frankie Tahoe? -Who? -Frankie Tahoe. Drug dealer. Scumbag. About yea tall. You accosted his bodyguard outside of one of my clubs Iast night. Sent the Iittle pussy home with his tail between his Iegs. AII we found of Frankie this morning was a puddle of blood and a couple of teeth. And what makes you think that I had anything to do with it? I know you had everything to do with it. Bodyguard knew your name, and that stripper knows your face. And yours. She was staying Iate to give Frankie his own private show Iast night. She had slipped away to grab a rubber when you and your boys interrupted the festivities. Bitch-ass motherfucker! Fuck you! She saw the whole thing. That was quite the Perry Mason moment, Counselor. -It was, wasn't it? -Yeah, Iet's see. I'm ID'ed by a dead chicken-shit bodyguard and a strung-out stripper. -Yeah. -What are you gonna do for an encore? Pull the murder weapon out of her ass? Well, as entertaining as that might be, I don't think it's necessary. The verdict is already in. What do you want to do? You owe me for the Iife of my employee. Well, since drug dealers are pretty much a dime a dozen in this town, you got change for a penny? Frankie Tahoe may have been worthless in the eyes of God and society, but he was an exceptional drug dealer. You all right? You're Iooking a Iittle pale. Richie, un bicchiere d'acqua. You gotta be careful. The stress will kill you. I know how you feel. I don't want any water. -You all right? -I'm fine. Looked Iike you were having a heart attack. You scared me for a second there. Okay, so, the way I figure, your Iittle batting practice cost me at Ieast 1 00 grand a year. Profit. Maybe you can write if off on your taxes. AII right, smartass. The only reason you and your boy Friday aren't Iying inside a couple of chalk outlines right now is because I'm a Iittle curious. If your actions were justified, maybe we could work something out. So, what did Frankie do? Kill your mother? Fuck your father? I have it on a good source that he was out to kill me. I'd check that source if I were you. Frankie didn't wipe his ass without getting the go-ahead from me. If he was planning on killing anyone, I would have known about it, 'cause I would've had to okay it. The way I see it, there are several options to consider. Option A, you pay off the debt. We'II say, Option B, you work off the debt. I could always use a couple of good Ieg breakers. Then, of course, there's the unpleasant option C. That would be the aforementioned chalk outline? If there's enough of you Ieft to chalk. You know, there is an option D. Might be a Iong shot, but it does exist. Are you fucking serious? You can't be serious. You're a Iittle fish. Splash, splash, splash. I'm a shark. Bank account, body count, I got you beat on all counts. I am the ever-present threat Iurking just out of sight. By the time you realize I'm there, it'II be too Iate. I will drag you down. -Like that bitch at the beginning of Jaws. -Okay. Nino, Iet me explain something to you. I ain't no bitch. I'm Roy Scheider. We all know what happened to Jaws when he messed with Roy Scheider. -The shark got blowed up. -He got blowed the fuck up. You Iisten to me. I don't give a fuck who you are, what you have or who you fucking killed! Fuck this shit. Vincent? Vincent? Honey? So you wanna tell me how Bollino knew your name? -What? -You think I'm fucking stupid? I asked you a question. Do you think I'm stupid? -Son of a bitch! -What's the matter? That's the guy I saw outside of the bodyguard's apartment building. -You sure? -Yeah, I'm positive. Marisa? Fuck. It's going to voicemail. Motherfucker! Go, go! Marisa! Just give me a minute, will you? Give me a minute. Listen, I need you to take Julian over to your mother's. No, no. Nothing's gonna happen. Just do it, okay? PIease? Nice wallpaper, Jeff. Really works. Charlie, now, what did you have to do that for? Our employer would Iike to have a Iittle talk with you, ask you some questions. Think of it as a Iittle chit-chat, a tte--tte, as it were. Should you try to hinder us from transporting you to said employer, we have been instructed to shoot you on the spot. So, for now, just relax. Breathe. Think happy thoughts. Easy. Hey, easy with him, huh? Now, if you stay calm, cool and cooperative, you may even Iive to see tomorrow. Come on, hurry up. Move. Jesus Christ! Hey, man. You know it. You know, I'm only doing my job. You know what'II happen to you if you kill me, right? Your boss set the pace. I'm just trying to keep up. That was for blasphemy. What are we doing here, Vincent? What's going on? Don't worry about it. That backpack Iooks heavy. Joshua, take Jeff's backpack for him, would you, please? -It's not that heavy. -Let go of the bag, Jeff. Let's all sit down. Let's see if we can answer each other's questions. You go first. Why are we here? 'Cause it's a safe place to talk. Joshua, you're up. -Vincent? -How much did you owe Frankie Tahoe? No. Jeff. -Back on the shit, Jeff? -Nope. No, Vincent, I was... Oh, God. AII right, Iet me guess. Frankie Tahoe gave you a Iine of credit, and you got in over your head. Am I right? Yeah. I imagine Frankie was the kind of guy that didn't mind pushing pretty hard when it came to collecting a debt. Probably looked forward to bills coming due. Katie. And I imagine he considered working people over to be one of the perks of being a drug dealer. What up, Jeff? You know, Iittle Katie really starting to blossom, right? There is nothing sweeter than some untapped pussy. I Iike that Iittle bald shit, you know what I'm saying? Fresh, right out of the oven. That's some grade-A cherry shit, man. You wanna take a Iittle sniff? Are you kidding me right now? I can't believe you just did that, dawg. We're practically family, homeboy. I just fucked your daughter. You're a dead man. -What? Come again? -I'm gonna fucking kill you. You got no right to be pissed off at anyone but your damned self, man. You owe me a Iot of money, homie. I'm gonna tell you right now, dawg, the way I see it, you're fucking Iucky Katie was in town visiting, man, 'cause she just bought you some time and saved you some broken bones, homie. I'd rather you broke every bone in my body. I would rather you killed me. No, Jeff, you don't get it, man. You see this here? This is a Iot more fun, homeboy. Lot more fun. How much did you owe him? You Iied to me over 3 grand? You fucking serious? You manipulated and you betrayed me for $3,000? You could have come to me. You could have told me the truth. I would have taken care of it. You could have come to me. I know. It wasn't about money, Vincent. It wasn't about money. AII right. How Iong's it been since your Iast taste? Last night. You want Joshua to cook you up a hit? Yeah. Did you ever hear the story of the scorpion and the frog, Jeff? There's this scorpion. He's sitting on a rock in the middle of the river and the water's rising, and he knows he's gonna drown. And he sees this frog swim by and he says, "Hey, man, give me... Give me a Iift to the other side of the river." Frog says, "You kidding me? You're a scorpion. "You're gonna sting me." Scorpion says, "No, I just want a ride. "I'm not going to sting you, I promise." So the frog says "Okay," and they start off across the river. Sure enough, the frog Iooks back, the scorpion's bitten him right in the ass. Frog says, "What did you do that for? Now we're both gonna die." Scorpion says, "I know. "I'm sorry, but it's in my nature." Hey, soup's on, huh? You're gonna hurt yourself. Give me the needle. Hold still. -Makes all the difference, huh? -Yeah. It's the only thing that stops the nightmares. You still get the nightmares, Vincent? Can't dream if you don't sleep. -I'm sorry I Iied to you, Vincent. -Yeah, me too. But it's not about the Iie anymore. It's about the avalanche of shit that's come down on me because of that Iie. What do you mean? Frankie Tahoe wasn't a private vendor, Jeff. He was employee of the month for the Donald Trump of the underworld. We pissed off the biggest junkyard dog on the East Coast. He's been shitting in our backyard all day. -Is that who sent those guys for me? -Yeah. Thank God you showed up when you did. The poor bastards didn't know what hit them. It was just Iike when we were teenagers and you dry-gulched those fucking Grays, remember? Yeah, I do. Remember what I used to say about you after that? You put the "Vince" in invincible. I don't... I don't know who this big dog is, -but my money's still on you, hoss. -They killed Marisa. No. No. Yeah, they killed her. They tied her up, and they butchered her Iike an animal because of your Iie and my actions. Oh, God, Vincent. Oh, God, no, Vincent, please. No. PIease. Jeffrey. Jeffrey. You don't have to explain anything. You're Iike a brother to me. -There's a reason, Vincent. -I know. There's a reason. Vincent, you gotta Iet me explain. PIease, Vincent. -I know. -Oh, God. Oh, shit, it's the guy's kid. CIose your eyes, motherfucker. This is 50 grand. It's called severance pay. It's time for you to get the hell out of Dodge. What are you talking about? I'm coming with you. No. This morning I owe you my Iife, and I can't be trusted. Now I'm in your will? I ain't dead yet. Just take the money. Yeah, but here's the problem. Nino's not gonna be happy until he kills us both and everybody we care about. I can't Iet that happen. I'm coming with you. That's not everything. -Get in the car. -Damn right I'm getting in the car. -You fully Ioaded? -Yeah. Work your way around the pool and find a way in. -I'II see you inside. -How are you going in? Front door. Twenty-four, and I got 19. I gotta go to work. -You need anything? -I already got what I needed. Three times. That was amazing, wasn't it? -They got Doc Holliday with them. -Holliday, huh? Cotton, you get over with the horses. Ike, I can't take this kind of gunplay anymore. Cut me out. Get over there. Hey, Richie, Nino's Iooking for you, and he's pissed. I think he's Iooking for Paulie. Paulie? Paulie Looch? -That's not a word. -Of course it's a word. It's foreshadow. -Ignorant motherfucker. -What the fuck is a foreshadow? -Foreshadow! -"Verb. "To show or indicate beforehand. Prefigure." -There you go. -Yeah, you know, it's Iike a sign that something's gonna happen. Hey! Any of you jerkoffs seen Paulie around? No. Fucking pansy. -Hello. -Hey, Paulie, Richie. -Where the hell have you been? -Who's Paulie? -What? -Who's Paulie? -Who is this? -Detective Miller, Homicide. Who's this? What happened to Paulie? Somebody shot him. Was he a friend of yours? Hey, Paulie! Where you been? Nino's Iooking all over for you. Hey! Paulie's dead. Seven of them are with Cotton. I only see six. -Mr. Nino! -In the kitchen. We got a problem. The police answered Paulie's phone. Somebody shot him. Hey, Vincent, is that you? I was just making myself a protein shake. You want one? -I'II have yours! -Okay. A salute, motherfucker! Hey, Mr. Nino, what's going on? It's an old-fashioned mobsters ball, Larry. -You ready to dance with the devil? -What? Just watch the fucking stairs. Jesus... I'm gonna go upstairs and get that son of a bitch. I'II take care of things down here. Nino? Nino? Should I call the polizia? Baby, this is no time to make jokes. Go hide. Fuck! Come on, you cocksucker! I'm gonna go grab another beer. You want one? -You got it, Johnny. -Cotton, you chicken-livered, miserable... Well, I'm a Iittle surprised. I was unaware that Nino went and hired us a house nigger. That's impressive. You want to see impressive? Let's do this old-school. -Are you wearing a vest, Nino? -Yeah! Ain't you? Fuck, that hurts. I know I nailed you with the shotgun. How bad is it? I've had worse. Well, we ain't done yet, Vinnie! Motherfucker. Change for a penny. That's too bad. He was gonna get me a beer. Is this the piece of shit that killed Marisa? Yeah, that's him. Sometimes you can take a wrong turn and find yourself on the most God-awful stretch of road imaginable, spinning your wheels, praying it's not a dead end. -T ell me about my father. -What? My father, Vincent. Your father was a junkie. He never did anything for you. I saved you from that. I raised you. You owe me. How many times do you want me to tell you? He was a dope dealer. He owed a Iot of money to a Iot of people. You owe me the truth. You know the truth. He was dead before I got there. Love, honor, power, fear of death, people live for all kinds of reasons. Some are more noble than others. When all you have to live for is revenge, it can really bone your quality of life. You think you can kill me because of it? Well, you can't. You're too Ioyal. It's in my nature. Subtitle By CosTantEn=Kalawy
