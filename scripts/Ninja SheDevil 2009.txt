Many believe it is based on the sounds creaeted while making the brush strokes to write the character for "woman" in Japanese. However, "kunoichi" is properly written with the Japanese characters for "nine" and "one". "9-1" is also the Chinese designation for a female spy. The derivation of this name is thus: It is a fact that every human body has at least nine "holes". However, the body of a woman has one additional "hole". That is, when compared to men. On that anatomical note, we now present the battle of a female ninja who uses that female weapon to its fullest. Legendof the Voluptuous to Kunoichioh Legend of the Voluptuous Kunoichi Tsusnoichibame is Story You've gotten better, Tsubame. AlI thanks to you. No, we can't go any further. I want you, I want you! No! Tsubame, do you not Iike me? Then why? Is it your brother? I have to go. Tsubame! Before you go, can you tell me you love me? I love you... Tsubame, I love you! Where were you? Just outside. I told you not to go into town. You know, don't you? For us shinobi, mingling with the common folk is... Strictly forbidden. For us shinobi, mingling with the common folk is... I know very well. We have secret orders, sit down. It's a direct order from our lord, Kuniyoshi Tajimi, issued an hour ago. What? Listen, this is a very important mission, a mission only you can do. Yes! As you know, Lord Kuniyoshi doesn't have a wife. Because of that, Koicha, the concubine of Lord Kunisada, his father, is apparently plotting to have him assassinated to elevate her own son Kunitsuna to become the next in line. Mother... Kunitsuna... Mother? Kaede, Lord Kuniyoshi's wife, has already been cursed by some sort of spell caster and can't resist earthly temptations any longer. Though Lord Kuniyoshi planned to have his concubine, Yamabuki, bear his child so he could become the rightful heir... I've also been reduced to this sorry state. I can't make the journey to the village beyond the mountains to see Yamabuki. Yet, summoning Yamabuki would be too dangerous. That's when... Lord Kuniyoshi remembered your secret ability. My secret ability? The ability to store a man's seed inside your womb for seven days after intercourse, an ability which only you possess. The Spell of Transportation... You will have intercourse with Lord Kuniyoshi, deliver his seed to the village beyond the mountains, and implant it in Yamabuki's womb. Be at ease. Get up. So, you are Tsubame. Yes! I apologize for asking this of you. Don't mention it, sir. Well, I don't know how much longer my body has left, but I've done enough living for a million men. I haven't time to fight you. I am prepared, sir. Good, then wait in the other room. Excuse my insolence! I have but one request. Fine, speak. May I approach? I'll allow it. Thank you, lord. All right. Thank you. Let us begin, then. Excuse me. Is this your first time? I will be gentle. Beautiful... It's like a beautiful flower. I'm going inside you now. Umm... Virgins really are so tight. I'm going to cum. My lord, I have received plenty of your seed. I 'm counting on you, Tsubame. Where are you going? We're leaving right away. Just outside. Come back right away. Yes! Taichi, I'm definitely going to come back. Brother! Brother, what happened?! Tsubame, hurry! The enemy is already onto us. No! Stop worrying about me! Go! Brother! A kunoichi, huh? You bastard! You're too weak. I can still spare your life. What is Kuniyoshi planning? I see, you don't want to talk. Then, I'll have to beat it out of you! Brother... Damn it! Brother... Brother, hang in there. Tsubame... Tsubame, I'm counting on you! Brother! If you complete this mission, you will be relieved of your shinobi duties. I have received permission from Lord Kuniyoshi. Start a family with Taichi. Would it be possible to relieve Tsubame of her duties as a shinobi after this mission is over? I'll allow it. Brother! Avenge me... Brother? Brother! Brother! They seem to be up to something. I see, and? They got away this time, but another plan has already been set in motion. I will capture that kunoichi Tsubame and reveal the nature of her secret mission. What happened? You're hurt badly. Let me treat that, come. You're set now. If you had left it untreated, it would have gotten infected. Thank you. There's porridge in the pot. Have some and regain your strength. Don't be shy now. Anyway, whose kunoichi are you? The wound speaks volumes. I know because I used to be one too. You too? Yes, but not anymore. If you don't want to talk about it, it's fine. You'd be a failure as a shinobi if you answered every question anyway. I'll take you to a hot spring once you've eaten. The water is really nice. It will heal that wound in no time! Nice, isn't it? Yes! I feel rejuvenated! Umm, I have a question. Go ahead. Why are you living out here, so far from civilization? People who lived in the shadows like me, we don't get along with normal people that easily. Are you thinking about quitting your life as a shinobi? Is there a man you want to be with? I was like you too, now that I think about it. He was a ninja on the enemy's side. It was a love that could never be. Hayabusa, where is he? What is he doing now? Hayabusa? Do you know him? He's my brother. What?! That means you're Tsubame? So, where is he now? He's dead. I see. Kill me! Kill me already! What are you doing? Why were we born as rivals? It's our fate! Everything's fate! Then, it's also fate that we met. What are you babbling about? Kill me already! If I'm going to be killed by you, this is how I want it to be. That was the only time we had sex. After that, my lord lost against the T ajimi clan and I somehow made it here. I wonder what would have happened if I had stopped being a shinobi back then? By the way, what kind of mission are you on right now? Our encounter must have also been guided by fate. I'll help you in any way I can. Don't worry, I don't hold a grudge against the Tajimi clan anymore. You're just as stubborn as Hayabusa! Get your rest tonight. I'm sure that your wound will have healed by morning. Taichi... This way, Tsubame. Taichi! Hurry up, Tsubame. Taichi? Taichi, wait! Taichi! Taichi! What's the matter, Tsubame? Taichi? Yeah... When you disappeared, I went to your hut and saw that terrible scene. While I was worrying what might have happened, Kagero appeared and told me about this place. Kagero did? Yeah... What in the world happened? You can't tell me? Taichi... Do you dislike me, Tsubame? I wanted to see you. Really? Then, tell me that you love me, like always. Go ahead. Who the hell are you?! What are you talking about? I 'm just... There is no way that a normal person could have gotten here in half a day, when it took me two days with my wounded leg. Besides, I haven't told Kagero about Taichi! Well done. You are Hayabusa's sister after all. Well, I guess I'll do this by force then. I'll get revenge for my lord now! Now, spit it out. What are Kuniyoshi's secret orders?! Struggle! The more you struggle, the more these will cut into your body. Now, speak! If you don't, your body will be cut in half. Now, I can finally be with Hayabusa. What's this? Ah I see, I finished my mission. It looks like it will rain. Brother! Tsubame, Taichi... My brother's alive too. Lunch time! Did you make these? Yeah... It's good, huh? Yeah, it's great! Oh no, I fell asleep. I have to hurry up, the spell's going to fade. If only I wasn't transporting this cargo... If I did that, my brother's death would be in vain. Taichi, I will definitely return. You're... I finally got you. Now, let's hear Kuniyoshi's secret orders. What is he planning? I don't know. What are you doing? If you keep being stubborn, your pretty skin will get cut. What about this, then? Spit it out already. Spit it out or else you won't be able to use this anymore. I don't know! Damn, you're an annoying bitch! However, what about this? Can you see him? That's... The next time it won't be fake. You're a coward. Say what you want. If you value his life, you better start talking. I don't know. I don't know that man. What?! All right, then we will see who is better at this game. Tsu.. Tsubame! Why are you here? I don't know that man. Then, you don't care what happens to this man? Tsubame... What is... Taichi, I'm sorry. How about now? Willing to talk? I said I don't know him! How about this, then? I don't know him. If you don't talk now, this guy's legs will be crushed. You damn stubborn kunoichi. Kunoichi? Stop! Don't! Don't say it. Taichi... Tsubame, do you know how worried I was when you disappeared? Now, I understand. Why you never said that you love me. I never thought that you were a shinobi. That's why I'm glad that I could see you again, even like this. Taichi... If I'm obstructing your mission, then I don't need to live. I will die for you. Don't be stupid! Could you just tell me before I die? Taichi... Taichi... I love you! You bastard! Go to Hell! I thank you for undertaking this arduous journey. It was my mission. And our lord's seed? It's securely stored in my womb. That truly is a wondrous ability. We don't have much time. We should get right to it. What should I do? First, please disrobe. Now, please spread your legs. I'll begin now. My lord? Yamabuki, I've missed you. I 've missed you too. Now, please have my child. I promise that I will give you a worthy son. Right! Taichi... Tsubame.... Is this a dream? Whatever it is, we're finally united. Everything you do feels so wonderful. Yamabuki, you're so beautiful. I love you. I love you! You finally said it. I love you too. My lord, I'm going to... Me too! Tsubame! Taichi! I have received our lord's seed. Yes... A FEW MONTHS LATER Please be safe. You have done a great deal for us. Are you sure that you will not come to the castle? I'll make sure that you are rewarded properly. You're too kind. You are too selfless. No, I've already been relieved from my shinobi duties. Now, I'm just a girl who doesn't fit into society. You needn't be concerned about me. I am just going to live here quietly by myself. I see. Well then... I'm going back to our lord.
