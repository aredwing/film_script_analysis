Where are the men to help Thomson? I'd like to see them all burn in hell. Thomson! Thomson, come out of there. Roy, want me to go with you? No, thanks. This town may not need a deputy, but it sure needs a fireman. I'm here to talk about my man. It's death, murder. You've murdered too many good men, Thomson. Come out into the street. Or are you a coward? A back-shooting coward who won't face me! Going for a ride, sheriff? Come on, let's give him a hand. That's a boy, good boy. Oh, Sheriff. Come on, you're all dirty. You've got to practice your mounting. Look, here's a present for you. Come on, get him up. Let's give him a guard of honour. I'm old. Much too old. Warlock beats me. Got to get out of this town. - Got to get out. - Too late. Too late for us all. - Come on, Curley. - I can't find Johnny. Where's my horse...? Johnny! - Wake up, Johnny. - No, let me sleep. You're a fine example of a big brother. - I want to feel good... - Yeah, sure. Come on. Attaboy, Billy, help me. - Help me to feel good. - I can't figure you, Johnny. I swear I can't figure you. Pony Benner! Come on, let's go, Pony. - Hurry up, I've got to go. - If you'll just give me time. It'll do no good. You're the ugliest. Come on. Look what he did. Look what he did. Come on, Pony, let's go. Johnny! We've got to go. Thomson didn't stand a prayer, did he? - Did he, Abe? - Johnny, you're drunk. Were Cade and Benner supposed to shoot him before or after he drew? They had orders to shoot only if there was interference from outside. From who? No man in Warlock would dare come against you. No? There's getting to be a lot more. New ones all the time. I've got to keep letting them know I was here first. How long does that give you the right to run things your way? - As long as I want. - Yeah... All I'm saying is, when you stand to win, you've got to be able to stand to lose too. The time has come to take up arms in our defence. Last night was the fourth time in a month. Driven to cover by them murdering cowboys. We put our faith in Thomson and he ran. While everyone else hid. An excellent point, Miss Jessie. It's time to stop hiding. We've got them outnumbered 5 to 1. We've got to fight them with arms. At the risk of losing our own lives? I have ore I have to deliver from my silver mines. Yet my miners are terrorised, my wagons wrecked. We can't let this anarchism, murder and violence destroy Warlock, even at the risk of our lives. I say we arm ourselves and stand and fight. That's the only way and you all know it. Wrong, wrong, wrong. All wrong. You're using anarchy and murder to prevent anarchy and murder. You're doing the same thing as McQuown. - What's the alternative, Judge? - Law and order. There is one other way, we can hire our own marshal. - Lots of towns have done it. - We can't hire a marshal. There's no such position here, we're not legally a town. He'd be just as much a marshal as you are ajudge, Mr. Holloway. On acceptance, as you put it. You'd act for the citizens of Warlock. The only way to handle this is the legal way. Send for Sheriff Keller. What'll he do? Send another Thomson? Keller's 50 miles away. He might as well be a thousand, for all the times he comes down here. I say we try our own marshal. This looks like a happy gathering. Something we should know about? Just foolish committee talk. Something I can do for you? With all this foolish committee talk, half the stores in town are closed. It is supply day at San Pablo, Mr. Richardson. Let's see, a half dozen sacks of flour... Give me a few minutes, Curley, and I'll be open. Yes, sir, Mr. Richardson. We wouldn't think of breaking up such an important meeting. I tell you what, we'll wait outside. Pony, Johnny and me. Benner killed our barber. An hour ago, we were all very indignant about that. Yet, there he stood, and none of us did anything. All right, Henry. You've made your point. But who are you going to get for your marshal? I have a man in mind. Clay Blaisdell. Serving at present as marshal in Port James. You mean, vigilante, gambler, gunman. I'm sure we've all heard about him. There's even been a book written about him by Kalib Bane. Mr. Bane attributes all manner of courage to Mr. Blaisdell. He presented him with a pair of gold Colts for his brave deeds. I saw Blaisdell once, in Port James. The day after he killed big Ben Nicholson. Nicholson was a bad one. Blaisdell deserved those colts. Is this superhuman going to subdue the savage beast by the pure power of his eye, or the menace of his six shooter, or simply by his reputation? None of those, Miss Jessie. Blaisdell's only hope in Warlock is to be lead-proof. There she is, Clay. Warlock. A pretty enough town. Better than some I've seen. - Just for a short stay. - We'll find out. They're coming! They're coming! I saw them! They're coming! I saw them! They're coming! Well, Jessie. There he comes, gold handled Colts and all. This is a real beginning for Warlock. - He's here. - And I'm going. - I've sold out to Morgan. - I guess you have. I wonder if we all have. Morning, Mr. Blaisdell. Blaisdell, I'm Judge Holloway. - I didn't know Warlock had ajudge. - On acceptance only. Same way you're a marshal. I want to get a good look at you. - They say you're a decent man. - I thank you. But it's not enough to be decent where you have to kill men and judge which men to kill, the word is the law. I guess I'll be the law, Judge, on your acceptance. Not on mine. I don't accept you. Any man who's got himself set over others and isn't responsible to something bigger - Is a murdering swine. - Shut up, Judge. There's something bigger than all men, and that's the law! Do you hear me? The law! - A nice welcome. - Better than some I've seen. As I understand it, I have full authority accountable to you, the citizens' committee. - Yes, accountable to us. - That's what I said, Mr. Petrix. I'll carry out my duties in ways best fitted to the job, the aim being public safety. Peace and safety, that's our aim. You won't be surprised then, if I have to post men out of town. As a last resort, in the case of real trouble makers, they'll be informed they come into town at the risk of their lives. I suggest you start by posting every one of the San Pablo cowboys. Just a minute, Buck. All those boys ain't bad. I like Curley Burne and Billy Gannon, among others. It's McQuown and Benner... Mr. Skinner and Mr. Slavin, you'll let that be my choice. There are one or two real trouble makers. If I give you their names... He's not your private marshal, Mr. McDonald. Also my choice, Mr. McDonald. One other thing. Some of the town folk have been wondering about Mr. Morgan whether he'll have any official status. May I see that? Tom Morgan is my friend. We've been friends for over ten years. I've never known him commit an evil act. You'll have to take my word. I started working for him as a faro dealer. I still do on occasion. - Faro dealer? - Yes. We're partners. The 400 dollars I get from you would hardly pay for my ammunition. Fortunately, as a faro dealer, I'm an attraction. Things work out well. I presume by that you mean that people come hoping to see you shoot someone dead. - You don't approve of me, Miss... - Marlow. Jessie Marlow. It really doesn't matter. I'm in the minority. You won't be in the minority very long. People generally begin to resent me. I don't mind, it's part of the job. - I let me assure you... - It will happen. I come here as your salvation on a very high wage. I establish order, ride roughshod over offenders. At first, you're pleased because there's less trouble. Then, a strange thing happens. You begin to feel I'm too powerful, you begin to fear me. Not me, but what I am. When that happens, we'll have had full satisfaction from one another and it'll be time for me to leave. You speak as though from experience. Has this happened many times? Yes, ma'am. In a lot of towns. Clay, aren't you finished yet? - Come on up. - Excuse me. We might as well adjourn. They can't hold guns, but they sure can hold meetings. What's that? The black rattle snake of Port James. That's a very poetic image. Come on, I'll show you your quarters. Murch, start cleaning up downstairs. All right. Well? This'll fix up fine. First, we get rid of all this trash. Look, we each have a bedroom. I'll fix this up real fancy. Don't work too hard. There's only one bunch of gangsters, the McQuowns. Won't take too long. These aren't just tuners like up in Port James. I hear this is a bad bunch. In any case, let's drink to the next town. To this one, first, and a successful meeting with the McQuowns. The sooner, the better. Get back to work. - Evening. - It is, isn't it? Some of McQuown's boys just came in. Is that so? McQuown come himself? Not yet. I've been doing a little investigating. See that big fella? That's Jack Cade. Number two to McQuown. Next to him is Chet Haggin. The little sneaky one on the right is Pony Benner. Jack Cade is supposed to be the meanest. - I see you added something. - I wondered when you'd notice. She came in the last batch from San Francisco, with those drapes. I held out because I didn't know if you were big enough to handle her. Very pretty. I wonder if McQuown's coming in. Don't worry about McQuown. He'll never come up against you. His style is to play with a backshooter. Watch out for Cade. You said that before. Want me to handle some of the action? I'll play it my way, Morgan. See if they don't have to too. It'll help to put on your gold handled pair. There'll be a lot disappointed if they don't see them flash. They're for Sundays. This is a work day. See you downstairs. - I'm ready. - All right. Let's have a drink in the French Palace. Maybe that marshal will join us. - Let's go get him. - Take it easy, Billy. Let's go, Johnny. Murch, they're coming. Watch for backshooters. Anyone moves, you let go. With this? It'll mash half the place. Anyone moves on Clay's back, let go. I don't care who you mash. All right. - What will Blaisdell say? - Nothing, if he's dead. Evening, Mr. McQuown. Gentlemen, the place is yours. - Nice place. - Thank you. A drink for Mr. McQuown and his friends. - Hope you enjoy yourselves. - We will. Blaisdell will be half way back to Port James by now. - Don't you wish it, Pony? - This is a different breed of horse. This will be a real good one. Hey Billy, maybe you, me, Curley and Chet can have a game of cards. Whisky. Mr. Marshal. I wonder, could I make a little complaint. I guess it's up to me. There's just been a heap of fussing about it, but it seems like folks have gone and left it up to me. It's them gold handles of yours, Marshal. I hope you ain't wearing them. They're awfully hard on a man's eye. I'm just speaking for myself. I'd hate to get a case of eye strain from them gold handles. They're so bright in the sun and all... A man just ain't much use without his eyes. And I hear there've been an awful lot strained in Warlock lately. You could close your eyes. I'd just look foolish. I'd bump all over the place, trying to get around with my eyes closed. Marshal, por favor, couldn't you just not polish the handles so bright rubbing on them, like they say? I guess I might do that, if things felt right in town here. Marshal, what if somebody painted them handles black for you? That might do... But, who's to do it? McQuown. McQuown. McQuown, my name's Blaisdell, I'm hired to keep the peace here. I'm going to lay down two things and back up all the way. The first one's this. Any man starts a shooting scrape, I'll kill, unless he kills me first. Number two is what the citizen's committee has agreed to. If a man makes trouble, he'll see himself posted out of town. It's what some towns call a white affidavit. It's backed by me. Any man posted comes in, comes in against me. That's all I've got to say, McQuown. Blaisdell! - Go for your arm, Blaisdell. - Billy! - Go along, son. - Let's go, Billy. That wasn't so hard. I thought they'd never leave. You dirty yellow, I'll cut that stinking... Stop it! - Stop it! - One day, I'll shoot that hand off. Stop it, Johnny. Let's not stand around squalling at each other. I knew about Cade, now I know about you. You're both backshooters. That's enough. It's bad enough we're running back - Our tails between our legs - I just want to make it plain. Shut up, Johnny. Shut up. You coming, Johnny? No, Billy. I guess I'll be staying in town. - Afternoon, Mr. Gannon. - Hello, Mr. Morgan. Seems like you and me are social pariahs. What do you mean? We're the only two in town not invited to the wedding. - Yeah... - Me, because I'm a no good gambler. You, because you're a no good San Pabloite. I'm not a San Pabloite, not anymore. It's a pity they don't believe you. Just as they don't believe me. - Weddings. - You don't like them? Mr. Gannon, we pretend to be free men. Yet, when conventionality spreads herself out fold by fold, we eagerly approach pretty misses that bind us to domesticity. You read that in a book somewhere? I think I just made it up. What I'm trying to say is that civilisation is stalking Warlock. Mr. Morgan. I'm Fen Jiggs. Ed Hamilton sent me from Port James. Come inside. Maybe you gentlemen feel things have improved in Warlock. - Maybe your safety is improved. - It certainly has. Not one drop of bloodshed since the marshal took over. It ain't the same outside, I lost a thousand stock in two months. I ain't holding McQuown responsible, but he's shifting a lot of cattle. It's not only rustling, there are road agents. I told my drivers not to resist a hold up. I carry no shipments of any value. Today's the last bank shipment, I don't count on it getting through. I'm making no accusations, but if I were marshal I'd get after a couple of boys named Benner and Friendly. What would you do with them? Take them before ajury of trembling fools that would let them off? - Allow me, Miss Marlow. - Thank you. - May I join you? - Of course. I enjoyed your playing and your singing. - Thank you. - You have a sensitive touch. My mother played the melodeon. Even killers and gunmen have mothers, Miss Marlow. - And you loved and respected her. - Yes, ma'am. Mr. Blaisdell. - I think I owe you an apology. - What for, Miss Marlow? Dr. Wagner told me what you did against McQuown and his men. You've done what nobody else even came close to doing, without firing a shot. I did it only to convince you I'm not the wickedest man in the west. I respect that, and I admire you for it. My father hated violence. - He opened the mines, didn't he? - Yes. Anyway, Mr. Blaisdell, will you accept my apology? You see? It's happening. I warned you about that in my first meeting with the committee. People changing their minds about me, I mean. You said people would fear and resent you. People that liked and wanted me would, people that disliked me would... Change, Miss Marlow, it's inevitable. - But it goes both ways. - Does that worry you? No, not at all. It has compensations. - How many on the stage? - Three. Her, him and the one from the bank in Bright City. There must be money in the box... She could be in danger of a hold up. You better leave now. And tell Ed thanks. I wasn't planning on going. Get a fresh horse at the stable, tell them you work for me. Thanks, Morgan. - Ed said you'd be pleased to hear. - I am pleased. Murch, have my horse saddled. Here it comes. Reach! Put that down. Box down. Let's see what the passengers have. Calhoun! Friendly! - Get the doc? - Henry. - Get the doctor! - Get the doctor! - What happened? - Threw down on us on the road. Shot a passenger. The team took off. One of them was Pony Benner. One was Pony Benner, the other was Billy Gannon. If we ride to hit the river, we can get them. Marshal, deputise me and I'm your man. - I'll ride with you, marshal. - Jack, get some horses ready. - There were two of them? - Only Benner and Bill. There were three. - I only saw two. - There was one up on the ridge. - The one that killed the big fella? - What big fella? My friend's name was Nicholson, Bob Nicholson. A brother to Ben Nicholson of Texas. We had to let him lay when the team took off wild. - I'd like to go with you. - Didn't you hear, Gannon? - One of them was your brother. - I said I'd like to go. Ride out after the passenger. - I'd rather not. - Somebody has to, I'm asking you. Well, boys, let's go see what San Pablo looks like. Welcome to Warlock, Miss... So you couldn't get along without me, Lily? - You could've told me you were coming. - Didn't you know? - I'd have had a brass band out. - Didn't you? Didn't you? Won't you come into my parlour? Remind you of home, Lily? I was on the stage when it was held up. - That must've been exciting. - A man was killed. So I heard. Somebody said he looked like a high roller. - He wasn't with you, was he, Lily? - It was Ben Nicholson's brother. I went more than 5000 miles looking for Ben Nicholson's brother. Lily, Lily... How you run to those Nicholsons. Haven't you had enough of killing? Not till I see Blaisdell shot dead. Wherever he goes, I'll follow him and see him shot down. For taking away the only chance I ever had, and killing the only decent man I ever knew. You have decent mixed up. There is one decent man, but hell has turned you loose on him. Ben Nicholson was a cheap gunman. He came after Clay, called him up and drew first. You put Clay up to it. If you believe that, you should get somebody to shoot me. There'd be no satisfaction for me in that. You don't care about yourself, but you do care about Clay. And when he'd dead and in the dust, I'll look at you over his body and laugh. Lily, Lily, Lily... You'd better leave Warlock. You'd like me to go. You'd give a lot, wouldn't you? I'd give a lot more to have you come back to me, Lily. For what? So you can send me back to work whenever you run short of money? I thought you did it because you loved me. How could I have ever? You cripple! The marshal's back. The marshal's back. Mike, you and Slater take him inside. They've got Pony Benner, the killer. - Trouble? - No, they came like lambs. McQuown spouted scripture about truth and justice. He's already on his way to make sure he gets the right jury. That's out of our hands. I sent Sam Brown for the sheriff. - Let's hang them, marshal. - Let's save the sheriff a trip. - Yeah, marshal, let's hang them. - Yeah, hang 'em. - Hang 'em. - Hang 'em, marshal, right now. Guard them till the sheriff arrives. Use as many men as you need. Get out of here. This isn't an assembly hall. Let's hang them now! - I expect they mean to make trouble. - I don't think so. Just the same, we better stay here. You better go, Gannon. - I just want to talk to my brother. - I had nothing to do with it. You're better with a Winchester than with your mouth, Calhoun. I wasn't even there. Go on, tell him. - They'll be trouble down there. - Sounds like it. - Saw someone today to shock a man. - Yeah. - You seen her? - Yeah. People I'd rather see in Warlock than Lily. The passenger they shot was Ben Nicholson's brother. Came after me, I guess. Looks like them bad boys did you a favour. I never could figure that Ben Nicholson gunning for me. He'd settled down, there was even talk of him and Lily getting married. There was talk of a lot of men and Lily. Ben Nicholson was a man with pride. He had to be top man, so he tried you out, that's all. Is that all? He had a reputation, but he wasn't that kind. I'd hate to think there was no reason for me to kill Ben Nicholson. He was on the prowl for you. He came gunning for you. Now, his brother comes after you. - Is it that simple? - Clay, it's that simple. Hold it! Hold it! Get out of here before I shoot. - You can't stop us. - You'll see if I don't. If you think a bunch of drunks are going to bust this jail, you're mistaken. Get out of here! We'll tromp you down, Slavin. What's Johnny Gannon doing here? He's one of them. I said, get. - Need another man? - We surely do, Clay. We're taking those road agents out to hang, Blaisdell. You ain't gonna stop us. We'll tromp you down like the rest. Come and tromp me, Fitz. Come here. Come here. - This ain't your pudding, marshal. - Come here. You've done McQuown's work tonight, Blaisdell. If you've anything to say, say it, or go home. All of you, go home. And while you're doing it, think how being in a lynch mob is a low a thing as a man can do. Thank you, marshal. Thank you kindly. I have to thank you. It was my job. There's a man. Why don't you bring his boots and we'll kiss them like he wants? Like you all do. Bring us his boots! He just saved your life, Billy. I wonder why. Mr. Richardson, you'll see that any witnesses against him get to the trial. A lot of good that'll do, sheriff. If you thought that, why didn't you let the mob have him? We don't do things that way in Warlock. Oh, we don't? I hear you get paid 400 a month, Mr. Blaisdell. You and Morgan are quite a team. I hear you have silk sheets from China. I get a hundred a month for being legal sheriff. Plus rheumatism from sleeping cold nights. Mr. Blaisdell, I've read a lot about you. The way I figure, you operate outside the law, same as those cowboys. What law? When do you come down here? Why aren't we supplied with enough deputies? Job's open. You can have all the deputies you want. Well, you want the job, Buck? For what? 40 dollars a month and a free pine box. How about you? You want to try doing it legal for once? Sorry, sheriff. The principle appeals to me, but the pay doesn't. Any man here ready to be deputy? Or is everyone in Warlock chicken-livered? Or too greedy? You want law in this town, I offer you law. Just don't come whining to me when there's trouble. And watch yourselves, hiring outside gunmen who make a living by killing. Anybody? All right, then. - I'll take the job. - You, Johnny Gannon? If you think I can do it. Sure you can do it, Johnny. Sure you can. Come inside. Keller, you can't do this. - Why can't I? - He's one of them. I've known Johnny Gannon all his life. He seems to have been a good boy. Maybe a little wild, but you can't condemn a man for that. Further, you can't condemn a man for his brother or friends. What's more, he volunteered when no one else did. So I'm making him the new deputy of Warlock. And he'll be there till I remove him. Or he's carried out. You know you're putting him up against Blaisdell? Against any law breakers. You understand that, don't you, Johnny? - I understand. - Fine. Adis, gentlemen. Looks like law's coming back to Warlock. But for how long, Judge? Miss Dollar, I just saw you coming up here. - You're the new deputy? - Yes, my name's John Gannon. I thought I might ask you a few questions. Those boys were let off, you know. Acquitted. Isn't that what everyone expected? Yes, ma'am, but I'd like to know who killed your Mr. Nicholson. He wasn't mine. You said there was a third man, a shot came from behind some rocks. So it did. But what's the difference? They got off. Yes, ma'am, but I'd still like to know. Of course, your brother was one of them. They're your friends. I'm not one of them, Miss Dollar. Suppose I tell you I know who killed him, what would you do? I'd go after him. Do you know? No, there's very little I know. I'm a woman, I only feel things. You're a deputy and you want answers to questions. - I tell you it doesn't matter. - It does matter. The citizen's committee is meeting right now. And those men from San Pablo will be posted out of town. - By Clay Blaisdell? - Yes. And if they didn't do it... Your brother's just a boy, isn't he? He's nineteen. No, he's not a boy. But that's not really why I care. - No? - No, ma'am. I'm the deputy sheriff, and if Clay Blaisdell goes after him, I believe it's my job to keep the law. - You'd go against Blaisdell? - If I have to. I'm not a boy either, Miss Dollar. Mr. Gannon... I'm sorry. I've rented a house. I rented it off Mr. Petrix and... some boys are dropping my trunks round this afternoon. I wonder if you'd help me move in? Sure. I'd like to help. - Around five. - All right. - I'll try and cook supper for us. - Fine. You don't have to look so worried. I can cook. - Good evening. - Good evening. I thought you'd come dressed for work. You said work and supper, so I wasn't sure. - So I did. Come in. - Thanks. It's a nice place. There'll be no supper till all the work's done. All right. What would you like me to do first? You can start by putting those trunks in my bedroom. Yes, ma'am. That smells mighty good, Miss Dollar. - Corn bread, meat and greens. - Fine. Guess there's not many men in Warlock eating home cooked food tonight. - Keep working, deputy. - Yes, ma'am. Mighty good. You didn't finish your greens, Mr. Gannon. - My mother used to say that. - It's a thing women say. - Where is she? - She's dead, Miss Dollar. Lily. Just Lily. She died about nineteen years ago in Nebraska. - And you father? - The Apaches killed him. That was in the early days out here. And Blaisdell's going to kill your brother and the others. - If they come into town. - You know they'll come in. You knew Blaisdell back in Port James, didn't you? Long before Port James. I knew Morgan. If you knew Morgan, you knew Blaisdell. He dealt faro for Morgan. People knew him as a killer right from the start. He was a colonel in the army at 21. He never quit being a colonel. All he knows is killing. What sort of man is this McQuown? Worse than he ought to be and getting worse all the time. - I used to think highly of him. - But you left, and your brother stayed on. That's right. I left. - Why? - Oh, a lot of reasons. What reasons? I never told anybody this before, but... About 10 months ago, some Mexicans were supposed to have been massacred by Apaches in Rattlesnake Canyon, at least, everybody said it was Apaches. But it wasn't? No... No it wasn't. You see, we'd rustled more than a thousand head at Haciendo Puerto across the border, but those Mexicans trailed us back here. So one night, a bunch of us stripped, smeared ourselves with mud and boxed them up in Rattlesnake Canyon. We killed them all. I don't know, it was kind of like a dream. I'll never forget laying there, sweating, covered with mud, waiting. It was so quiet and then, they came. Abe gave the signal, we all started to fire. It was just awful. I don't think they got off a single shot. All around me, Abe and the rest were screaming like Apaches firing into the canyon till there wasn't anybody left to shoot. I say it was like a dream, but it wasn't, it was real. It happened that way. - Good afternoon, Miss Jessie. - I was just out riding... on my way to Medusa Mine and I heard the shots. I had no idea it was you. - My, it's hot today. - Yes, ma'am, it certainly is. - Not as hot as yesterday though. - No, not nearly. I heard Buck Slavin say he thought today was hotter. - Matter of opinion, I guess. - Of course, a matter of opinion. Would you happen to have some water in that canteen? - The heat makes one terribly thirsty. - Yes, ma'am, I do. That's all right, I can drink right from the canteen. - You were out riding, you said. - On my way to Medusa mine. That mountain water sure makes one feel much cooler. Yes, ma'am, it generally does. What are you doing out here? Not shooting at bad men? - No, practising. - Practising? Yes, ma'am. Just as you practice the piano, I practice the Colt. The stakes are different, but the reason's the same. What should we talk about now, Miss Jessie? The men you posted are coming into town. Thank you for warning me, but I've already heard. Why does it have to happen? Why do these things always end in bloodshed? That's how things are. That's why I was hired, why you hired me. So, they'll come into town - And you'll shoot them dog dead? - Or them me. Or them you. Understand, Miss Jessie, I enjoy being marshal. I'm a simple man, good only with Colts. It's all I am, handy with Colts. Besides, being marshal's a habit. Habits are hard to break. I know about habits. Before my father died he was sick for nine years and I nursed him all that time. Guess I have the nursing habit. That summer, there was a typhoid epidemic and I turned the house into a hospital. There were the injured miners... It's strange... When I came to Warlock, a very young girl I had dreams that someday, I'd be someone. My father kept telling me I'd be someone. You're someone, Miss Jessie. You're the miners' angel. Don't say that. I hate being an angel. Miss Jessie. If you had whisky in that canteen, you'd see how much of an angel I am. Have you ever tasted whisky? - Many times. - How many? Once. - I wanted you to do that. - I know. - I came out here to find you. - I know. Is that dreadful of me? Dreadful. It's cooked just right, Jessie. It takes a while to get used to a man's tastes. My father used to like his meat barely scorched. Chicken fried, that's the only way. Clay... Why must those cowboys come into town? They've been declared guilty of being road agents. If they stay out, yellow bellies besides. If they come in, they'll think they're heroes proving their innocent. Striking a blow for freedom, too. Men have died for that many a time. I'll fix your eggs. Morning, miss. Is the marshal available? Will you inform him there are three murdering cowboys in town? - Come in, Morgan. Have a coffee. - No, thank you. There isn't time. - Where are they? - Down at the Lucky Dollar. I better go see what they want. - You haven't had your breakfast. - Just as well, miss. If he takes a stomach wound, it's better if he hasn't eaten. Keep the coffee hot, I'll be back. Clay... - I'll make you a fresh breakfast. - Thank you. I think we're going to see a finish of the McQuowns this morning. Yeah, then we can move on. Where to? A fellow dropped in last night from Palfrie City. Sounds like it's made for us, booming with a gold strike, we ought to take a look. - I don't think so. Not this time. - What do you mean? Jessie and I are going to get married. Yeah? When? In a couple of weeks, as soon as I can get a preacher. I guess I'll be going to Palfrie City alone... Why do you have to go? It's the way it's always been. You do ajob, you move on to the next. This time, it's different. Blaisdell, reach. It's a bad morning for thinking. Thinking of weddings could lead to a funeral. - Shall we, marshal? - Thank you, Mr. Morgan. - We're with you, marshal. - Good luck. If I can help, marshal... Deputy! - Marshal, let me try to talk to them. - What good would it do? - One of them is my brother. - We're wasting time. - We have to move now, Clay. - It's my fight, deputy. - They called me out. - Yes, I know that. - All right, go ahead. - Thanks. You're throwing in with us, Jonny? - Billy, you can't do this. - You're a weasel, like Calhoun. Blaisdell saved you from that lynch mob and he could've killed you that night in the French Palace. There's no need for this, no reason. There's reason enough, to stand up and be a man. This is a free territory, and while gunmen like Blaisdell... You're talking Abe's foolishness. He'll kill you. I'm not scared of him. Are you, Johnny? I'm scared of dying, just like any man, and so are you, Billy. I just want to know what you're going to do. Are you going to back me, or Blaisdell? I won't back him, because you're my brother. And I won't back you, because you're wrong. Pony said it'd be no use. Come one, Blaisdell! Billy, don't! You don't have to fight me. You and your partners, just ride out. Go for your gun. Don't make me kill you, boys. Clear on out. Go for your gun! Oh, no... Billy, Billy... I had nothing to do with it... Start shooting, or get out of town. I could've killed you, if they hadn't done that. We only wanted to talk. Mr. Richardson, we only wanted to talk. Friendly... Three hits. One through the throat, two not a finger apart, through the heart. I must be losing my touch. All three were chest aimed. Clay, you've been hit. Is that true, what Friendly said? You saw it, Mr. Petrix. Did it look like they came to talk? - Let's have nurse fix that up. - I'll take it to Miss Jessie's. Doc will fix it while I finish my breakfast. You gotta... You gotta... You gotta tell everybody, Johnny. Yes, Billy. - I didn't know. - Yes, Billy. Billy... Billy, Billy, Billy... Billy... - Evening, Mr. Marshal. - Are you McQuown's messenger boy? No, sir. This poster is my work. Excellent lettering and spelling, don't you think? But not your idea, I hope. No. I have to give Abe full credit for that. Chief of regulators. That's a fancy title. Did you think that up? No, sir. Once again, Abe gets the credit. He said that if Warlock could appoint a marshal outside the law, then somebody could appoint a chief of regulators. And who would that someone be? That's be the Cowboys' Council for the Protection of San Pablo. I made that title up. You know, this could get to be quite a thing. The town of Warlock appoints a marshal he kills a whole bunch of us cowboys and we appoint regulators and we kill you and the town gets another marshal who kills more cowboys and we appoint... Well, you can see how it'd go back and forth for all time. It'd be like looking into two mirrors, put face to face. Marshal, I've got so many of these. I wonder if you'd like to have one, as a keepsake. Thank you. For your collection. Clay... You've seen the poster, huh? You take the buggy, Jessie. I'll stay and talk to Tom. All right, Clay. Maybe you better stay and find out what it's like being married to a marshal. If he doesn't handle this right, he'll be a dead man. I'm sure Clay can handle almost anything. An army. An army's coming in. This isn't just a test, like when we first came. This is a war, ma'am, a war they have to win. Fifteen or twenty men against two men. If you're worried about the numbers, maybe I better handle it alone. Maybe I will, Clay. Maybe you better go to Palfrie City alone. All right, Clay. Maybe I will. Miss, maybe you'd like to take a Colt in his defence. Blaisdell... I just want to tell you that this is my job. - To keep the peace. - How do you propose to do that? I'll tell McQuown he's not to come in. He'll come in all right and, when he does, you're not going to fight my fight. I guess I'll have to. This is the law's business, not yours. Nor yours, Mr. Morgan. Looks like our problem is solved, Morgan. The law's taking over. - You can't mean that. - Why not? Let's see if Warlock is grown up enough to take care of itself. Clay, if you're not the marshal, you're nothing. Maybe it's time. Maybe we've run out of towns. Boys, we have a visitor. If it isn't Johnny Gannon, come back to San Pablo. Come in, Johnny. Don't stand there like you mightn't be welcome. It's bad manners coming out here with that star hanging on you. - Whisky, Johnny? - No, thanks. Didn't come to drink. I came to tell you not to come into town, Abe. - Blaisdell sent you out here. - No. - Who's the message from then? - From me. You. You're telling us. I'm the deputy, Abe, and I'm telling you. - You are posting us. - Nobody's posted. But no wild bunch of "regulators" is coming in to make trouble. Let me rip that star off him, Abe. - That's the way it is, then, Johnny? - That's the way it is. What do you mean coming ton my place telling me I'm not to go in there? Look out, Abe, I rode out with him. Johnny's getting mad. Blaisdell will cut us down one by one unless we go in there together. That'd be a thing I'd be bound to stop too. Yeah. Like you stopped him from cutting Billy down. That was a fair fight, Abe. At least, from Blaisdell's side. Billy came in to kill him. Calhoun was set to backshoot him. - That's a lie. - No, it's the truth. I talked to Billy before the fight and I'd swear it in any court of law. Yeah, you'll swear all right, but, you'll swear Billy said he only wanted to talk to Blaisdell. Swear it. Swear it here and now or I'll see your dirty, lying soul in hell. I guess I won't, Abe. - Swear it. - No. - Swear it, or I'll kill you. - No. Go on, hit in. Cut him up. - Say it. - No. Say it! Move, Johnny, and I'll cut it off. Don't move, Johnny. - Swear it. - No. Abe, this isn't doing any good. Hold off, Abe. Swear it, Johnny, or I swear I will kill you. You better kill me, if you want to take your regulators into Warlock. Otherwise, I'll stop you. I'd sure like to see him try to stop us, wouldn't you, Abe? I'd like to see that, Abe. Stop us, then. We'll be in tomorrow. Give it to him. He can't do anything with it, anyway. I've warned you. Don't come into Warlock. Johnny... I'm the law, Curley. I'm the law. I'm alone. They coming in? Yes, near sundown. Cade says he's going to kill you himself, Johnny. - I thought I saw... - It's all right, Buck. Why did you come in, Curley? Abe's gonna be mad. I thought that if you knew they weren't coming till sundown, maybe you've got business in Bright City or something. I'm staying here. Go back and tell him that. - That hand, against Abe and Cade? - I'm staying. - My, but you're brave... - Go back and tell them I'm here. You're a fool, Johnny. Curley... Cade gonna be doing his usual backshooting? The least you'll get is a fair fight. - I promise. - Then, tell them. It'll be a waste of time. I'll stay around town and wait. This hand won't hold much, especially not a Colt. Well, I guess I've got time for some sleep. So you'll be clear-eyed when you die. Doc, maybe you could give me some laudanum for later. - Six drops in a glass of water. - You're against McQuown and Blaisdell. You'll be killed, you know that! Yes, come in. A lady to see you, Mr. Blaisdell. Come in, Lily. I came to ask you for something, a favour. I want Gannon for Ben Nicholson. - You owe me this, Clay. - I owe nothing. Ben Nicholson came after me. He called me out. Don't you know he went to see Morgan first? Morgan sent him. I don't believe that. It's not important any more. I don't care about that. I don't even care about Ben Nicholson anymore. I only want an end to this killing. I hated you and wanted you killed, but I don't want that anymore. Clay, I was wondering... Well, well, well... Hello, Lily. What's she going to do, shoot you or poison you? - What did she want? - She's worried about Gannon. Is that all? - Morgan... - Yeah? Did you talk to Ben Nicholson the day he died? What would I have to do with Ben Nicholson? - What did you tell him? - None of your business. Come here again and talk to Clay behind my back, and I'll kill you. I'll kill anybody who's dangerous to Clay, even you, Lily. Tom, why do you do this? He's the only person who looked at me and didn't see a cripple. Get out of here. Better say a prayer for the soul of your deputy. Not too bad, huh? Not too good, either. I never was very fast, but I can shoot well enough. Well enough may not be good enough. Afternoon, deputy. Hello, Mr. Blaisdell. Guess I'll be getting some early supper. Blaisdell, if you've come to offer us help, we don't want it. We? Hadn't you better let Gannon decide that? Don't you understand that as long as you're here there'll be killing? You're a target. They must come after you. Let us alone, Blaisdell. Come on, judge. Come on. - Mind if I sit? - Go ahead. - How's your hand? - It's all right. I remember when I first killed a man. It was clear and had to be done. I went home afterwards and puked my insides out. I remember how clear it was. Afterwards, nothing was ever clear again, except for one thing, to hold strictly to the rules, only the rules matter. Hold onto them like walking on eggs. So you know you've fought as fair and as best you could. But there are things to watch for, in yourself. Don't be too fast. When there are people after you, you know it, you're worrying, then, you think... if I don't get drawn first, and them killed first... Know what I mean? I know. Can you draw with that hand, deputy? I can. Let's see you draw. This evening, there'll be a lot against you. I'd be honoured if you'd accept my offer to help, just to back you up. Mr. Blaisdell, I'd like your help more than anything in the world, but it's time this town stood on its own. Who knows? Maybe the people of Warlock will help by backing the law. I wouldn't count on that. But I'll be there to back you. Will you come and have a whisky? No, thanks. Maybe later. Right now, I've got things to do. Sure is noisy out there today. Little boys waiting for the circus parade. How. How. Lily is sure gone on that deputy. - Pity she won't have him long. - Unless we take a hand. Meaning what? Remember that time in Gran Fort, those strangers had us in a hotel with a guard? Lily splashed a can of kerosene, came running up all on fire. She sure got us out of that one. I think we owe her one, Morgan. That's funny, that's very funny. You've practically give up marshal in this town. The only way for you to be important is for Gannon to die. Now you want to back Gannon, so he'll be the hero and you'll be nothing? - That's very funny. - I'm not playing king of the mountain. It's not a question of who's top or bottom. It's this town holding together against McQuown. - I'm a citizen of this town... - If you want to play second fiddle, don't expect me to back you. I've never asked for your help before, Morgan. Clay, how do you think you've stayed alive this long? They're here, Morgan. You're not going out there to save Gannon. After he's dead, they'll beg you to protect them. Just sit down and wait, Clay. Blaisdell was right. He said I'd put too much on you. - They're here. - You put nothing on me. It's just a time and a place for a showdown. You haven't a chance unless you let Blaisdell help you. No, judge. If a deputy's worth anything, he can't hole up when there's trouble. You're nothing to me, just a badge and an office, that's all. Get yourself killed. You're nothing to me. Abe, I'll give you five minutes to leave town. Johnny, go for your gun, you yellow-livered coward. Go on! - Hold it. - Hold it. - Drop your gun. - Take it easy, Joe. I promised you, Johnny. I promised you a fair fight. You regulators are all under arrest! Brown, you, Bush, Mosby, you're deputised to take them into Bright City for trial. Now, we'll see how far the law can go in Warlock. - You gambled and lost, Morgan. - At least you're alive. Am I? Think they'd have backed you, like they did Gannon? They pay you half hoping to see you killed. Wouldn't it be better to go down decently? Isn't that what you've always said? - I've kept you from it many a time. - Like now? - Hiding in a room with a gun on me? - No, like in Port James. It was me that got the drop on them. And the Ellersons, me again. And Calhoun, ready to backhoot you, who saved your life? Me. - And Bob Nicholson at the stage? - And Bob Nicholson. And Ben Nicholson, too. Lily was telling the truth. You used me to get back at Lily. Lily had nothing to do with it... Morgan, you're telling me things to make me kill you. I'm going to Jessie's. I'll send for my things. We'll talk later. Clay, you've got to face Gannon. - Let him know you're in charge. - Gannon's in charge. I'm resigning. Or would you have me kill him too because of Lily? - That's not why I did those things. - No, then why? - Why? Was it for me or you? - Not for me. You're my friend. - The only friend I ever had, Clay. - It's finished, Morgan. Clay! You won't face Gannon because you're yellow clean through. Has Jessie made you like that? Clay, I'm not the cripple here, you are. If you don't kill Gannon, I will. I swear I will! Murch... Murch! Bring me some whisky. "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace... from day to day... to the last syllable of recorded time." Murch, give me your Colts. - You're been drinking... - I said give me your Colts. I'm the black rattlesnake of the whole territory. I'll kill anything that moves. Just sit still, or die. And, if you move, you crawl. Who wants to die? I got lightening in both hands, I'm just spoiling for a fight. I'll kill anything that moves! I've killed 45 men, and tonight I'm going to run up that score. Where's that brave deputy? That great cowboy killer. What's he doing? Hiding? Gannon! I'm the all time champion cowboy killer! Sorry, deputy, drop it right there. - Get inside the cage. - What is this? - Inside. - What do you think you're doing? You're a brave man, but Tom Morgan is my responsibility. Gannon! Crawl out of your hole, you yellow-belly. I'll run you out of town. Gannon, do I have to come in after you? Morgan! Morgan. Hello, Clay. - Let me kill him, Clay. - No, Morgan. Why? Because you think you owe Lily? This isn't a game you can cheat and make a fraud of. I'm going to have to run you out of town. Then, I won. Clay, you run me out of town, I'll go like a lamb. You'll be a hero again. That's all I want. - I've won. - All right, you've won. We'll play this out till the end, just as you wanted. I'm telling you to leave town. All right. - I'll see you in Palfrie City. - No, you won't. - You'll be there. - No, Morgan. I'll be waiting for you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - I'll tell you something, Clay. - What is it, Morgan? I'm better than you. I've always been better. I can beat you, Clay. You hit it. And you better hit it fast. I won, Clay. I won. Get your hands off him. Say something. Say something! - He'd have killed somebody. - He broke my arm. - He was after trouble. - What are you worth? He was out to kill somebody, marshal. - Who? You? - Might've been me. - What are you worth? - The Lord delivers. Judge me. You judged him, judge me now. Judge me. What will you do? Kill all of us for your pain? I've had too much of you. Crawl for it. Crawl past him. He was a man, not all talk. Take your hats off. Take your hats off! Now, you can sing. Sing! Stand back. Johnny, he'll kill you. Stand back, deputy. Sorry, Blaisdell, it's time. - Time? - You can't stay here. Trouble and death follow you. Warlock's had enough of both. - Are you running me out of town? - No. I'm just saying I'll have to arrest you in the morning, so I'm asking you to get out before. Nobody tells me that. I come and go as I please. No longer, Mr. Blaisdell. I'll have to come after you. Come shooting, if you do. - I'll do that. - You'll have to. I told Blaisdell he's to get out of town by morning. I heard. And is he going? No. What do you want? Your whole life in one night? Johnny. Clay. I've been looking for you. Have you been here all this time? - Jessie, why did he do it? - I don't know. - Clay, what are you going to do? - Yesterday... Was it only yesterday? I told him he was nothing without me. Maybe I'm nothing without him. That's foolish. We had a council meeting and everyone agreed that if you wanted to stay we could go to the deputy, I'm sure there'd be no problem. What would I do here? Stay with me, as we planned. - What would I do? - I don't know. Whatever you planned on doing before this happened. I never saw past this morning. I suppose I figured Morgan and I... What now? Shall I clerk in Richardson's store? Sell needles to old ladies? Should I take over McQuown's and nurse calves? Become a miner and live in darkness? If you loved me, none of these things would be bad. Jessie, come with me. We'll go to Palfrie City. I can become the marshal there. - To another town, and another... - Why not? It's the way I've lived, it's the way I'll always live. Times are changing, sure, but there'll be enough towns to last my lifetime. I'm not Morgan. I can't back you. I can't even hold a Colt, much less fire one. Who'll kill the backshooters in Palfrie City? Maybe I'll have to find another Morgan. Morning. There's the key, the judge has got the other one. Take care of it. People are out. Funny how they find out about things. Yeah... Well... - I guess it's about time. - Chilly out. Yeah.
