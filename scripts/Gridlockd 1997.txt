We're at the hospital Everything's going to be OK. - Cn I see a doctor now, please? - Just a minute, sir. I need a Social Security number and a Medicaid number, if she has one. I'm assuming she does since you put ''yes'' in this box. A photo ID and the address of her next of kin. My fucking lady's going to die here. We need a fucking doctor right now! If I knew the numbers, I would've written them down! - I need a fucking doctor! - You don't use that language with me. You don't know me. Where did you get off talking to me like to some tramp? Nobody talks to me like that when I'm trying to do my job, because you know what? I'd let the bitch die! - What is wrong, Gloria? - That man has lost his mind. Doc, the girljust OD'd and hasn't said a word in an hour. I'm as scared as fuck that she's going to die. Gurney! (COOKIE SCREAMING) Get off me! Get off! Let me go! Shut up, shut up, shut up!

The men had their sex changed, but now they're lesbian. Wait a minute. A man becomes a woman, yeah? But he doesn't do it to sleep with a man as a woman. He does it to sleep with a woman as a woman. Right. So he cuts off his dick so he can sleep with a woman without the equipment. Right. No. He could have saved a lot of money giving women head and keeping his dick. But then he wouldn't have been a woman. Oh, right. Excuse me, I forgot that part. (TV): The baby's fatheris also yourbaby's cousin. That's notright. There are some crazy motherfuckers in this world.

That shit's not funny! I am the vegetarian. Buy your own fucking food. (SPOON): Cookie, you are so full of shit. Don't you just love people who smoke three packs a day and say, ''I'm a vegetarian''. Fuck that. You can talk to me about health when you stop smoking, OK? Oh, yeah? You talk to me about smoking when you stop doing blow, arsehole. I win. (DOCTOR): Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

I don't want to go out like that, man. No. Ever felt that your luck's running out, man? I mean... Lately I've been feeling like my luck's been running out. Maybe Cookie OD'ing is some kind of sign. I don't know. You know what I'm saying? I'm kicking. I'm kicking. Are you going to help me? Get the fuck out of here. I'm serious. I mean... We don't even get high off the shit any more.

Brand-new 1,400-dollar video camera, remarkably well-priced. - 500 dollars, you can't beat that. - (D-REPER): 500 dollars? - OK, 400. - (D-REPER): Fuck off, I'll give you 200. - 200? - (D-REPER): OK, 100. - 100? - (D-REPER): Or should I run over your foot? Alright. But you know this is fucked-up, though? (D-REPER): All I've got is 83 and change. You're giving me 83 dollars for a 1,400-dollar camera? You're killing me here! Where's the change? Give me the change. (D-REPER): Fucking junkie. (STRETCH): Fuck you, your mama's a junkie. (CAR ACCELERATING) Fuck! What did you say? My mama's a what? You said some shit about my mama?

Know what I'm ''sizaying''? - Let go with that Pig Latin shit. - It's Bop. - Bop? - Yeah, from bebop. Take the first letter and put ''iz'' behind it. Then you add the rest of the word. Like ''saying'' will be ''sizaying''. ''Cool'' will be ''cizool''. You know what I'm ''sizaying''? - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, that's just cool I'm writing some of that bop stuff.

You better go and get this motherfucker out of my face before I shoot him. Come on, Stretch. Why am I always waiting for you? For once in your life can you just come on? I'm coming. I don't know why you're in such a hurry. You ain't got shit to do. - See you Thursday. - Cool You won't be seeing me for a while. It's my last day getting high. - New Year's resolution. - No shit. - Yeah. - That's good, man. I'm real proud of you. Shit, I need to kick myself, man.

You've got to chillwith that ''nigger''-shit, man. You're comfortable with me, but don't call me ''nigger'' in front of black people. They'll ask why I let a honky call me ''nigger''. Term of fucking endearment. It'll be a term of you getting your ass kicked. You can't say that! ''Nigger''! You're not black! You're going to say that shit to the wrong person, - and I swear to God I'll.. - Hey! Don't look up. That's the guy you hit in the head.

I brought her in last night. Actually, it was this morning. He could have fucking shot us! (SPOON): Yeah. OK, thanks. No change. Critical condition. I think you're right about this ''luck running out''-shit. We're fucking broke. Cookie paid the rent for the last three months. - (STRETCH): Now this... - Yeah. You're right. (TV): No, I think thatifyou do it in theprivacy ofyourown home, fine, butbreast-feeding inpublic is downrightdisgusting. This is Skip Woods takingyour calls.

What's up, Pecker Wood? - What are you doing here? - What are youdoing here? - New Year's resolution. - Me, too. What's the point of turning getting high into a job, right? Getting high is supposed to be fun, right? - What's going up, Spoon? - How are you doing? Did you hear about Kosher Dill?. Oh, man! He got off light and went south. - With some fine-ass Cuban bitch. - Really? I hear you're doing some kind of poetry shit, or something. Yes, something. - So how doth that shit be going? - Good. - When do the doors open? - They're already open. Is this your first time trying to get into rehab? - Yeah. - How about you, Grey Boy? - Yeah. - Have you all got a Medicaid card? No. You've got to have a Medicaid card to get into the programme. Fuck, I ain't got no fucking Medicaid card. Am I supposed to get out and get one now? Fuck that! If you sign up for the HIV test, they say they'll get you into the programme sooner. Otherwise, it takes six weeks. I ain't taking no damn HIV test. (NURSE): Hold still, please. I didn't want to have to do this. What are you going to do? Press the cotton on that spot, please. OK, the results will be in tomorrow, gentlemen. You may go to the front desk to receive your 40 dollars. Show them this yellow card. Your name will be placed on an HIV-tested waiting list. It'lltake a week to ten days to get into detox, and you'll need to bring in your Medicaid card at that time. Thanks, gentlemen. Yeah, thanks... ..for nothing, bitch. I don't know if I want to kick in ten fucking days. Let's try St James'. I want to stop by Mud and pick up some bags. - It's not even 10 o'clock! - But I haven't had a blow, yet. No point in walking around sick. Might as well save that 'til after detox. I'm going to need some support if we're going to do this. I'm with you. So, what the fuck happened? You fucked your shit up. A couple of motherfuckers came in here and rushed me. Pistol-whipped me and shit. I owed the nigger some money, but I told him I was going to pay him. They slapped Cee-Cee around and whatnot. - Damn! - I'm alright. - When did allthis happen? - Last night. Right after you left. - Right after we left? - Yeah. - So, D-Reper is a drug man. - Yeah, I guess so. (LATIN WOMAN): justput the shit through.! I've been standing here forthree hours.!

I love it when you've got the audience in the palm of your hand, and they're resting there comfortably. Then, bam! You crush those fuckers. There's supposed to be some record executives to check us out tonight. Yeah? We're going to scare the shit out of them. How much time have we got? (SPOON): We'll be back in a couple of minutes. (THEY URINATE) (COOKIE): Come on, boys, let's roll (TANNOY): Number97. Last callforB 97. Number98. - What? - Your number's already been called, sir. I was in the bathroom. I just missed by a couple of numbers. We're on number 8, sir. You'll have to take another number. - You've got to be kidding me! - (BLIND MAN): Hey, man. - Get back behind the line, asshole! - I'm offering you a ticket, schmuck. I always take an extra one for him. These people are such stone-cold pigs. - Thanks. - Anytime, brother. - (STRETCH): What? - The centre is now for alcohol abuse only. We no longer treat drug addiction. Someone gave you the wrong information. Fuck, fuck! Did anybody say anything about St James' being for alcoholics only? No, they didn't! Now, what do we have to do? - Temporary Medicaid. - What? We go to Welfare, tellthem it's an emergency and we need to get into detox. Spoon, I'm losing my patience with this shit! - (STRETCH): Fuck off! - (SPOON): Get out of my way. - What's up, fellas? - Two dogs with everything. - Two with everything. - Give me the same with nothing on them. You want the same or two dogs with nothing on them? - Are you a fucking comedian? - Cn you help me out? Get the fuck out of here, man! Oh, man! I'm a veteran, I've got disabilities, man. - (SPOON): What's his problem? - Stop busting my customers' balls. - Get the fuck away from me! - Yeah, that's nice. I like that. I'm paying for the white guy. Thanks. - Two dogs with everything. - Thanks. - Two dogs with nothing on them. - Get a fucking job! (GUARD): Hold up, chief, hold up! No food or beverages.

Turn around, please. Thank you. Thanks. (SPOON): How do you think Cookie is doing? She'll pullthrough. She'd better. Excuse me, sir. There's no smoking. Look, bro. I said there's no smoking. - (WOMAN): Next. - Happy now? Hi, how are you doing, beautiful?. Fine. May I help you? We'd like to apply for temporary Medicaid cards. - Are you on welfare? - No. You've got to be on welfare to get Medicaid. The only reason we need Medicaid is to get on a rehab programme today. Sorry, but that's still going to take four to six weeks. We don't have four to six weeks, ma'am. Next. The problem is, it's going to Lansing and back. These things take time. Temporary Medicaid cards are issued only for medical necessities. Why is everything such a fucking hassle with you guys? I sit here in need of help, and you give me bullshit about ''medical necessities''? It is a fucking necessity for me to get into fucking detox before I kill some-motherfucking-body! Do you understand what I'm fucking saying? Yeah, I understand. Oh, I understand. Let me see if you understand this, my man: Rules are rules. Am I supposed to change them because you sit across there screaming? Take a look at you. You fucking walk in here after five, ten, however many years, and because today is the day you decide to kick, the whole fucking world is supposed to stop?! Is that it? We've all been waiting for the day that you come through that door and tell us you no longer want to be a fucking dope fiend! Right? Get the fuck away from my desk. My brother, my brother. Look, it's been a long day. We're all stressed-out. We've been getting the run-around and we really don't know what to do. Downtown... Woodward and Jefferson. Thanks a lot, my brother. Come on, man. - Fuck it, I need a blow. - I don't know, Spoon. I'm just starting to feel a little fucked-up. - OK. - We'll be in and out. (SPOON): Mud? Hey, Mud! Hey! Mud? - What the fuck? - (SPOON): Yo, Mud! - Oh, fuck! - Oh, fuck! - Don't touch him! - (SPOON): He might still be alive. (SPOON): That, my friends, was fucking great! - (STRETCH): That show was the ''shizit''. - (COOKIE): Did you see the record company guy? (COOKIE): Said it's cool on Wednesday. - (COOKIE): He's a nice guy. - (SPOON): Yeah? What else did he say? - (SPOON): Give me that. - (STRETCH): What the fuck? (SPOON): Give it here, me and Stretch should do it. - I want to try some. - No! - It's New Year's Eve, come on! - Get the fuck out of here, Cookie. - You never do blow. - He gave it to me. It's mine and I just want to try some. This shit is fucked-up. Yeah... Who do you think it was? It could have been any-fucking-body. Why are you still using that spoon for cooking dope? The finer shit's evaporating. You should use a vitamin cap or cheese cap or something. (SPOON): Why? Because aluminium is a better conductor of heat than steel - (SPOON): No shit. - Yeah. Copper would be even better. I don't really know where you're going to find a copper top. I'd go with aluminium. Fuck aluminium, man. You get Alzheimer's off it. Old-timers... Wasn't that what Mohammad Ali got? He's fucked-up. He used to be so quick... ..fast-talking and shit. It's kind of sad. He's still got a quick mind. The shit just comes out a lot slower. This is some seriously good shit. I can't believe we found Mud's stash. - I knew where it was. - How much was in it? I don't know... Maybe three ounces. What? This is allyou fucking brought out? If we're kicking, we don't need it. Fuck that! What if we don't get into the programme today? We're going to fucking need it then. We could sell it, give it away, anything. You can't leave three ounces of free dope sitting in here. Look, I'm not walking around with three ounces of dope in my pocket. - We don't need it. - Fuck you! I'llfucking carry it. Let's just get the dope and get out of here. No. - Come on! - No. While you're in there, grab me a diet iced tea. - I can't believe you sometimes! - What are you talking about? - I can't believe... - Oh, shit! Did you guys hear any gunshots? - No, we haven't. - Somebody reported shots from this building. I didn't hear... We didn't... It was nothing. What about him? Does he talk? - How about you? Did you hear anything? - No. - What's your name? - Bob. - Bob? - Yeah. - Do you have a last name? - Yeah... Most people just call me ''Bob''. Do you think this is a joke? Johnson. I can't hear you. Robert Johnson. - How about you? - John Doman. - Do you live in this building? - We were here to visit a friend. Was I talking to you? OK, get out of here. - Hey! - Oh, fuck... What's her name? Your friend in the building. What's her name? Sharon... Sharon Barnes. Third floor. The problem is that we've got fundamental differences in our belief systems. You believe in the good of man, everything's going to work out. I knowthe world is a fuck-up and nothing's going to work out. - Don't put your arm on me, man! - What? You smell disgusting! Look at your pants. Is that puke on your pants? - Get the fuck out of here! That ain't puke! - It sure smells like it. Fuck you! What's the address? Medicaid. First and Jefferson. We were standing on First and there's Jefferson, but I don't see any Medicaid. - Excuse me! - Sorry, no spare change. I just wanted directions. Just some fucking directions! Hey! Would you come on? Come the fuck on! - I was a bad-ass builder about 50 years ago. - Yeah. How are you doing? Medicaid, please. Three lefts, a right and a left. Eighth floor. Two rights, two lefts and a right? Yeah. Two rights, three lefts and another two lefts. - Bye. - Thanks a lot. Hold that elevator! - (WOMAN 1): I can believe you said that. - (WOMAN 2): Yes, I did. You've got to tell a brother because they'll be in your... Excuse me, my sisters. We came here to apply for temporary Medicaid cards. They moved out three weeks ago. You have to go to the new office, 18063, Gratiot. (PHONE RINGS) No, they just told us to come here. We only do referrals here, now. 18063, Gratiot. So I said to him, ''Help? I don't need no help. I've got a job.'' (WOMAN 2): OK, right. Hello? (WOMAN 2): But then he had to say something, you know? - I don't know... - She couldn't leave it at putting up with him... Is there anything else? This fucking country is falling apart, man. People don't give a shit. It's ridiculous. The people with these government jobs sit on their asses, taking their time. You can't get them to help you, and if they do, they give you allthis attitude like you're wasting their time. Excuse me, it's your fucking job! (STRETCH): My tax dollars are paying your wages, I'm your fucking boss! Sometimes you want to reach across the desk and choke the shit out of them. (SPOON): Too right! Don't bust my balls because you hate yourjob. At least you've got one. There's a lot of people who can't get one. And if you do get a job there's no fucking security. A friend's cousin's sister's brother-in-law worked for the same company for 20 years. Then what happened? They fired his fucking ass! Excuse me. - Hey, I'm talking to you! - What? - What? - I believe you have something that's ours. - Is that fucking so? - Yeah, and we'd like to get it back. I'm sorry, I try not to carry more than one pair of pantyhose with me. (HENCHMAN): That's some funny shit. Come here, motherfucker! Come on, get in the goddamn car! (STRETCH): Officers! Officers, I'm so glad to see you! - We can't find the... - ..Department of Social Services. Yeah, the Social Services. We asked the kind gentlemen here, but they can't help us. - (COP): It's aroundthe corner, up on the left. - (STRETCH): just on the left. Thanks a lot. Mind if we walk with you? - Maybe you could point it out for us. - It's around the corner, on the left. - Yeah. - You can't miss it. - Is there a problem? - No. (SPOON): No, no problem. Well, yeah, there is. How long do you train at police academy for? What? I was just wondering how long it takes to become a police officer. It's just that I'm thinking of becoming a policeman. Going down, putting an application in... I wanted to know how long will it take, you know, for me to able to serve and protect. - Protect and serve. - Absolutely. (STRETCH): I can't find my Filofax right now. Cn I borrow yours for a moment? Fucking guy... Alright. Here. Personnel's open from eight to four, OK? Thanks a lot. You know, you guys are really great guys. I think cops get a bum rap sometimes. You are helping out a citizen with directions and employment information. You guys are great. You're professional Do you ever hear about guys like you? The ones who care and want to make a difference? No, allyou hear about are the racists. The ones who use excessive force. The ones who are on the take. The ones who shoot their wives. Never you guys. Never the ones who truly serve and protect. - Protect and serve. - Absolutely. - You guys are my kind of guys. Nice cops. - Yeah, thanks... You're the second set of nice people we've met today. You guys, and those guys. You see those guys? Those guys are really nice guys, too. We asked those guys for directions. They didn't know where Social Security was, but they were willing to help, even drive us. There go some really nice guys. Well, thanks for everything. You say it's just around the corner on the left, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Thanks again. I'm going to look into this. What the fuck was that? That was fucking great! Did you see those motherfuckers take off? Yeah. What the fuck did they mean by ''give us our shit back?'' Probably the fucking dope. What I can't understand is, how the fuck do we leave Mud's, go downtown, come out of Social Security, and have two guys waiting for us talking about us giving their shit back? Doesn't that seem a bit strange to you? Who gives a fuck? We lost them. We've only got to get to Medicaid before it closes, because if it doesn't happen today, it ain't ever going to happen. Yeah. It's about two blocks that way. - What time is it? - 4:30. - Let's stop and get some breakfast. - Yeah. Ding-ding! (TV): This is Billjacobs with the evening news. (SPOON): Knock, knock! Knock, knock!

We're going to get off the streets today. OK? Yeah. Fillthis out and bring it back to me. - Fillthis out and bring it back to me. - Thank you. Could you put the cigarette out, please? Fillthis out and bring it back to me. (TANNOY): Melvin Goldman. MrMelvin Goldman. I had a homeboy in high school named Melvin Goldman. Sure would freak the fuck out of me if he walked up to the counter. (SPOON): Little crazy-ass Melvin Goldman. The first time I got high I was with Melvin. This is one of those rich motherfuckers. The parents had everything. There were always six or eight of us ghetto motherfuckers at his house. I remember one night when his parents were out of town. We were getting fucked-up, smoking, playing pool We were drinking some 151 proof rum that we got someone to buy for us. And this guy comes in with some white powder, like ''who wants to try?'' I didn't know what the shit was. All I had ever done was maybe smoke a joint once. We were young and stupid. And it was fun. So we said, ''Fuck it, let's try some.'' Everybody got sick as dogs. The motherfuckers were running around throwing up and shit. And for me... For me that shit was like going back to the womb. I never felt such peace. I was home. I was sixteen fucking years old! Whoo! First you just got fucked-up on weekends. Then... Well.. Life is funny, ain't it? Somehow I don't think this was my parents' dream for me. Look at this! - Get rid of the dope and I'llfinish this. - Yeah. Mr EzekielWhitmore, please. - EzekielWhitmore! - (SPOON): Here! You came too late. It's almost five and we're not giving out more appointments, so I'm going to stamp your application this way. Come back tomorrow. You can go directly to me without waiting. I can't wait 'tiltomorrow, sir. Me and my friend need to get to a detox today. We've been running from office to office all day. I understand, but the best I can do for you is give you an appointment, and even if I did that you wouldn't get Medicaid today. You have to come back in ten days to see an interviewer. Once they've reviewed your case, they'll notify you by mail That can take a month. So whoever told me about getting Medicaid in one day was bullshitting me? I would say that is correct. Either that, or they were misinformed. See, the only way to get on is if you're HIV infected. - Yeah? - But you need a letter of proof from your doctor. I took an HIV test this morning at the New Centre Clinic. They told me I could get Medicaid sooner. - Hm... When willyour results be in? - Tomorrow. It's like I said. You come back tomorrow. You come to my desk after you get the results. That way, you won't have to wait in line. Yeah. Thanks. Oh, shit! (SPOON): Shit! Excuse me, pardon... - Stretch! - (STRETCH): Yeah. How did it go? (SPOON): The fucking ''5-0'' just came in. We've got to get out of here. (STRETCH): Give me a minute. (SPOON): You know that crap about getting Medicaid the same day? It's all drama! You've got to be HIV positive to get on. Ain't that some shit? (STRETCH): I'm HIV positive. (STRETCH): Spoon, are you alright? I would have mentioned it before, but I didn't know how you'd take it. I've always used my own works, and everything. - (SPOON): Does Cookie know? - (STRETCH): No. (STRETCH): It really didn't get far enough for me to have to tell her. You're the first person I ever told. What the fuck are you doing? I can't believe you, man! (SPOON): I tellyou to get rid of it and what do you do? (STRETCH): What am I supposed to do, flush it down the toilet? Fuck that! - ''5-0s''! - (COP): Freeze! Come out of there now! (COP): Putyourhands up andget out ofthere.! Move it!

(BLIND MAN): I don't want to live in a dump! (BLIND MAN): I fought in the fucking war and it ain't shit! I'll drag the whole goddamn government down, before I'll let them take me out like this. Is this my homecoming? Is this my fucking ticker-tape parade? Well, I can't see it! Incoming! - Incoming! - (COP): Freeze, sir! - Excuse me? - Cllyour dog or I'll have to shoot it.

I want you to stab me. - What? - Stab me. Get the fuck out of here! I ain't stabbing you! If we're in the Emergency Room we're off the streets. Once we're in the hospitalwe can kick, Stretch.

You've got to go, anyway. - Where? - Where what? - Where do you want me to stab you? - Oh. Where do you think is best? If I stab you in the stomach I might hit some organs and shit. Yeah, you're right. Not the stomach. What about the arm? Nah, too wimpy. If you turn around I can stab you in the back. No, you'llfucking paralyse me! Not the back. OK, my liver is on the left, the stomach's on the... No, my liver's on the left, my kidneys are back here and my stomach's on the right. No, my stomach's on the... Or are my kidneys on the left? I think the stomach's to the left. I know my lungs are right here and I definitely don't want a punctured lung. What about if I stab you between the organs? Maybe between where the stomach and the kidneys meet? Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. - Right here. - Yeah. Wait, wait, wait! Let's go over there, in the light. You'll kill me over here. - Which side did you say? - This side. - Right there. - Yeah. Come on, let's do it. Aahh! That fucking hurts! Fuck!
