"A place where we can maximize our abilities..." "Be ready for that Job interview" "I'm convinced that your company is the right place for me." Isn't that Kato?

Then I vaguely remember being sedated. Sedated? Yes. I was also hit by a car. I remember being taken to hospital, all bloody. And I was drugged there. That's when I started to get drowsy... But wait a minute. What's suspicious about that? Sorry, you're right. I'm beginning to see the whole picture. It's like I thought. We're not dead. We were taken to the hospital in a coma and drugged. The drug is making us hallucinate. Really? It's like group hypnotics. See? We're all seeing the same thing. That must be it We're being forced to take part in some kind of strange experiment. What is this thing? I don't know. It's a hallucination. Kei "go now please." Wow... We're outside. We're out now. I guess we can go home. I've had enough. Wait a minute. You deserve an explanation. This is for TV. You're under hypnosis on TV. See? I knew I wasn't dead My father is the producer of the show. It's a project by American cable TV and Yale university. It's a virtual reality show. Don't you know American try Out? If you complete the mission, you win $100,000. I begged dad to put me on the show. $100,000? That's 10 million yen Kato, look over there. Take a good Look.

Shoot him, you deserve the points. It's on me. Come on. He killed everybody. I Like the Look in your eye. You disappoint me. You won't survive the next round. It's happening again. We have so many survivors tonight Explain This is not TV, is it? Ask Gantz. That's Gantz. When I came along, people had already called it so. Hey, I thought you were dead Even if you're bleeding to death, you're OK as long as you're alive. "It is time for the scores." "0 points for Kishimoto, your tits are too big." What...? "0 Points for Kato, you are too much of a chicken." "0 points for Suzuki, you are so invisible." Invisible... "0 points for Kurono, you stare at Kishimoto too much." "5 points for Nishi, getting 79 in total." Just 5 points? What's this about? Gantz evaluated our mission performances. Our mission is to kill the space invaders. Who are you? I'm one, too. An alien. Don't get serious. I'm just kidding You asshole What happened to the others? They got killed. You saw it. See? They're the ones who died in the Gantz missions. Did you see the way the yakuza was blown up? And how Mr. Hypnotism was trampled on He died before he knew it It was even more awesome the other day... You could have helped those guys I know, you're one of those hypocrites. And you're clueless. You're taking it out on the wrong guy. Leave Kato alone Will you shoot this time? Yes, I will. Tell us what you know. What is this place? Speak. Sorry. Maybe next time. Was it a dream? "Witnesses please report" Is this about the accident we saw yesterday? Oh, please don't remind me. Sorry there was no toilet paper. Oh, gross. "...passengers were hit by the train..." I believe that each of us has a role in life. We all have something unique to offer. And there's a place where we can maximize our abilities. What is it that you want to do here? Pardon? What position? You don't say that at a job interview, man. I'm doing better than Kurono. nobody wants to hire him? No. He's kind of invisible, isn't he? He's the unemployable type. He boasts about being a soccer star. In grade school? Come on He'll vanish in the real world. That concludes the lecture today. Don't let them bother you. I'm kind of invisible too. What's the best way to get noticed? When I met my old friend at the train station... Kei? Was it grade school? Kato I'm Kojima. My name's Tae Kojima. "Students' addresses" "2, Yaguchi, Ota" "Kei Kurono, Masaru Kato" "Your friend forever, Kato" Kei, you're my hero Don't forget I saved your ass never We're friends forever You're home early, Akira. It's me, Dad. Kei, I didn't know you were here. How are you? I'm going now. Did you find yourself a good job? I'm working on it. Don't be a slacker. Akira already has his sights on a college. There's no house here. "2, Yaguchi, Ota" "Ichinomiya, Tama City" Hello. You know who I am? Hey! That's the... I had it on when I woke up. I visited Kato at his house. Kato... I wanted to... confirm with him about what happened 2 days ago. But... It looks like he's moved. I only had a 10-year-old address. I see... We should go to the police? They won't believe us. I guess not. I can walk you to the station. I have a favor to ask you. Sure. Can I stay over? uh-huh... Huh? Is it OK if I sleep on the bed? Of course. Thank you. I hope I won't have a backache in the morning... I'll sleep on the floor. no, sleep on the bed. I'm OK. Are you sure you don't have to go back home? My boyfriend's things are there. Oh, you live with him? We broke up recently. He just moved out. Oh, really. Then on impulse when I was in the bath... I slit my wrist. I didn't really mean to do it... You committed suicide? When I woke up, I was back at my place... I was too scared to look in the bathroom. I didn't want to see my body in a pool of blood... What's that? I borrowed it from Kato. I have to see him. I want to thank him for being kind. It's his diary. Maybe his address is in here. "Parole officer...?" "Masaru Kato, on parole." Was he in juvie? Let's stop. I saw his address. now I remember. I heard that he never went to high school. That's nothing to do with us. There was Lots going on in his Life. His dad was a violent alcoholic. Maybe Kato is too... He's not the type. How do you know? He's the kindest person I know. If only I'd met him earlier... Would you have lived? Whatever... I'm sorry. I'll turn off the Light. "Masaru Kato, janitor" Brother Hey, Bro. Aren't you going to bed? I will, soon. Trouble sleeping again? Bad dreams? Ayumu, off to bed. Wake up on time if you want to eat. not again...

It knows everything about us. There's no escape. You'll be called back every time. Every time... To get ourselves almost killed? Right. Gantz's been recruiting people Long before me. They fought the aliens and were replaced when they died. Many of them died. And I survived. You could have told us that If we knew, those others might still be alive You understand nothing, hypocrite You used them as bait. Correct answer I knew you and I were alike. What? Aliens lose focus when they are killing humans. Isn't that a riot? Tell us what you know Tell us what we should do to survive. Don't depend on me. How about using your brain? This suit... Put it on. It should be of some help. Off I go. Good Luck Grandma Do I have to do this again? How many times? I don't know. Put the suit on The attach case. Here. "go now please." Where are you, Grandma?

Oh, you answered It's me Tae Kojima, from college. I've never called you before Where are you now? uh...you know... Do you read comic books, Kurono? Sure. Do you like reading them? I guess so. Don't laugh when I tell you this... But...I draw comics. What kind? So? What do you think? Awesome. I know girls' comics don't usually have male heroes I chose an ordinary guy like you to fight evil. It's like me when I was a kid. Oh? It reminds me of my childhood. I used to protect my friend from bullies. Oh, did you Yes. I bumped into him the other day. I bet he doesn't remember me protecting him. You know... It's a hero's duty to fight evil. Anybody who's scared can run. I'll protect them all. Here's your coat. You met my brother? Yes, but I didn't talk to him. I didn't know how to explain our situation. Kato. What's going on in that room? Are we dead...? Or alive? When I woke up in the room I thought I'd finally died. For some time death seemed a good option. But now I want to live. Because I met you, Kato. So you saved me. That's why... I... I was in juvenile detention. I killed my own father. My father... He was drunk everyday and beat my brother. I wanted to save him... But I failed. I couldnt be there for him. I always want to be around to protect my brother. Sorry, I got carried away. Let me walk you home. There was an early morning fire at a Shinagawa parking complex on 5th. It's speculated that leaked gasoline caught fire. But the details are still under investigation. Similar cases of destruction have been reported in Tama city and other suburbs. The police suspect a connection... You look tired. Why don't you take a day off? Maybe I should get a job, too. Don't be silly, you should be studying. Something's bothering you. There's nothing. OK, I've been having nightmares recently with lots of people dying. They all get killed. But I can't do anything to help them. I can't save any of them. Lucky it's just a dream. You're right. Speaking of dreams I had a dream recently that you disappeared. But I'd be OK. You're the one who'd be in trouble. You can't cook. Ayumu. I will not go anywhere. I won't disappear. I know you won't. Give it to me. I believe that each of us has a role in life. We all have something unique to offer. And there's a place where we can maximize our abilities. Here it comes Here I go Ayumu. I will come back for you. Is it happening again? Yes. Listen to me carefully. This is where the selection is made. Will you go to heaven? Or will you burn in hell for infinity? Merciful Buddha watches us and decides our destiny. "Ill-tempered alien" "He's enormous and likes peace and quiet." You aren't dead yet. Join our fight so we all survive. I'll tell you what I know. First put on the suit that's in the case. We've already experienced this. You're going to have to fight, Like it or not. Shut up Don't be tempted by his words The Lord says this man is the devils advocate. You have to trust me in order to survive Put the suit on now Kato. Don't waste your time newcomers won't get it. Don't you want to help them? Yes, so I'll go alone. You'll die like the kid I'm different from him. Don't worry. I'll protect you, too. I just don't want to see any more deaths Kato. Are you serious? Maybe you just want out of here. no I know you. You're a hypocrite. That's not true... This isn't something for a guy from juvie. Come on. Let me go. Kato. There's no time for this... no way... Where is Hitomi? She was with me a minute ago... You want to put the suit on? You can trust that guy. This is cool... We're in Ueno park... It's so realistic. That's it... That's the one we saw on the orb. It's our target? Listen very carefully. Something unbelievable and horrifying is about to happen. If we cooperate, we can all survive... What the hell? Run Run Come on Surround him and shoot Kei, out of the way This sucker is mine. Damn!

Kurono, behind you Shit I'll go. You'll get killed You're hurt. I can do it. It's just Like when we were kids. You were my hero. I always wanted to be like you. But... You're right, Kei.
