There are three different kinds of flowers. There are lilies... ...and there are... Did you reach my sister? Wait a minute. Let's go back to the dream. Tell me more about these flowers. There's nothing more to tell. Besides, aren't you gonna tell me that we're out of time? We have a few more minutes. You were late today. I'm late for everything these days. What's making you late? Whenever I leave my apartment, I... ...I have to go back and make sure the stove's off. And then after I check it... ...I make sure the pilot light didn't blow out when I closed the oven door. Today I went back eight times. I didn't get to the store till 10. What happens when you're late? Nothing. I mean... I don't get into trouble or anything. My supervisor's been trying to get a date with me. Interested? In you? I mean, in him? I don't know. It could be that... ...you perform this ritual... ...in order to be late... ...to avoid a prospective lover, or anger him. You mean I'm passive-aggressive? You really should talk to her. To who? My sister. She says she knows some things... ...about my mother and father. Might shed some light. Maybe those are the things... ...we'd do best to uncover in our work here. You should really talk to her. You won't regret it. She's... She's a very interesting girl. Where have you been? I had to ask the judge to break. - My expert witness is half an hour late! - I was with a patient. Mr. O'Brien, you may proceed. In addition to your private practice... ...you are head of Forensic Psychiatry at Overland State Hospital. Correct? And in that capacity... ...you evaluate and treat hundreds of such cases like the one we have today. We're all aware of Dr. Barr's eminent qualifications in the field. May we just proceed? By all means. I thought we were proceeding. My client, Pepe Carrero, has confessed to stabbing his stepfather to death. The prosecutor... ...has taken the position... I wanna get this right... "Carrero is a dangerous schizophrenic, who should be locked away... ...in a maximum-security state hospital. " End quote. My conclusion was based on the fact that Carrero is a professional pickpocket. He's been in and out of the system... The question isn't whether he's a model citizen. He's already been found guilty. We're here today to try to figure out what to do with him. Very eloquent, Mr. O'Brien. Please continue. Did you conduct an examination on Pepe? Yes, I did. I saw him two hours a day over a five-day period. What did you find? First of all, I find clearly, Pepe Carrero is not a schizophrenic. His stepfather was beating him. And he'd been doing so routinely over a nine-year period. Pepe had an acute psychological breakdown... ...at the moment when the violence was threatening his life. In other words, he was temporarily insane. Unbelievable! Now, as an expert in the area of the insanity plea... ...what do you recommend we do? A state hospital... ...is really nothing more than a human warehouse. There's no therapy offered, only chemical restraints. Unfortunately, this will not help Pepe. What Pepe needs is... ...a structured program of intense psychotherapy. Are you suggesting that the state bear the expense of that treatment? No, no. If the state agrees with my diagnosis... ...I'd be happy to take on treatment myself. Free of charge. Why are you making such a generous and time-consuming gesture? This is not a gesture. If Pepe is safe... ...then we are all safe. Isn't that why we're here? So I'm gonna see you in my office? - Twice a week? - Absolutely. Twice a week. Thanks again, doc. I owe you one. Stay out of trouble! One big happy family. You upset, detective? Who, me? Upset? We cops love it when a guy walks, especially on a bullshit insanity plea. We both know this kid's not dangerous. There was no volition. I've heard it all before. If anyone should be crazy, it's me. Watching months of work go down the toilet because of you. I'm sensing an ugly hostility here, detective. Come by the office. We'll talk about it. I'll tell you what. I'll stay out of your office... ...and you stay out of mine. I think he likes you, Isaac. Around 6:00, this place is crawling with available women. The only thing that crawls here is you. I'm trying to give it up. Isn't that...? It is. Yeah... Gee, she looks great! What's the grace period... ...before you can ask your best friend's ex-girlfriend for a date? Ten, eleven years. As they say... If you say anything about fish or the sea, I'm leaving. I mean it. I was going to say, lust never sleeps. Some folk wisdom. Why don't I live vicariously through your conquests? I got a better idea. Get out of your office and meet people. - I meet people. - No, no, you meet patients. You work too damn much. Really. I can't help it. It's like my... I got this uncle, right? He used to sell shoes. You shake hands with the guy, he looks at your feet. "Nice instep you got there. What are you, a size nine?" Same with me. He looks at shoes... ...I look at people's thoughts to figure out what they mean. You do this enough, after a while people... They stop surprising you. I just want to be surprised, Mike. I'm Heather Evans. Diana's sister. Right. Yeah. She did say I was coming by? I hope. Yeah, she mentioned you might be... ...stopping by. She felt it was important we talk. She said you might be able to shed some light on her family history. Yes, maybe. You want to sit down? How often does this happen? What? A patient's sister coming by and talking to you. Not very often. Actually, never. Never? What exactly are you trying to do for Diana? I guess I'm doing what all shrinks do. To paraphrase Freud, I'm trying... ...to turn her neurotic misery into general unhappiness... ...so she can be like the rest of us. But she's not like the rest of us. How do you mean? Our father... Our mother left us when we were very little. And my father and Diana... My father was... Let's say... ...he had a lot of problems. Your father raped Diana? Yes. Do you think you can help us? Yeah, I think I can. I hope so. Isn't she beautiful, Dr. Barr? She said you guys met. Yes, we did. Compared to Heather, I always felt... ...like a caterpillar, creepy and crawling. A caterpillar turns into a butterfly, doesn't it? Heather's the butterfly. Isn't that obvious? I had the dream again. I'm arranging flowers on a table as a centerpiece. Lilies... ...carnations. What was the third? Remember what we said about the stove ritual? The stove ritual's over. I haven't done it in a week. I'm checking the gun now. I make sure the safety's on and that it's loaded. Ten times every morning. What makes you feel that you need a gun? I don't. It's Heather's gun. She made me take it. How does it make you feel... ...when you're... ...checking the gun? It's my surrogate penis. And my safety being on is because I'm ambivalent about my phallic fantasies. And the bullets are semen. Do you think about the dangers... ...of having a loaded gun? All the time. Diana, if you don't mind... ...have your sister call me. Diana said you wanted to see me. I did. - How long were you waiting? - Not long. I didn't want to bother you at work. I was working late. Want to come in? Come on in. Why don't you take your coat off? It's soaked. You want a cup of coffee? I don't have any coffee. You want a drink? I can't drink. I mean, I don't drink. - Glass of water? - That'd be great. It's really beautiful. Thanks. "The insanity defense... " No, no, don't do that. It's just a paper I've got to deliver. Are you giving a speech? At a symposium on law and psychiatry. Fascinating. It's in a couple of months. Diana told me about the gun. What gun? The gun she said you gave her. I'm worried about Diana enough. I'm not gonna give her a gun. Believe me, there is no gun. I'm still concerned. You see, a fabrication like this is... It's a kind of fantasy. A fantasy is a kind of wish. You really thought I'd give her a gun? But you wanted to see me anyway. Yes, I did. The rain stopped. Want to go for a cup of coffee? Sure. I can't imagine doing what you do. Just talking to people every day about their problems. What do you say? You repeat the last two words people say and rephrase it like a question. Your mother? Isaac, I'm married. I should have seen that one coming. Three years. No wedding ring. We share an apartment. Emphasis on "apart. " Why are you still with him? You try divorcing a Greek Orthodox gangster. Gangster? What, does he have a pinstriped suit... ...and carry a violin case, this guy? He builds public housing for the poor. Gangster. Can't get more corrupt than that. So this is it? We're finished? To be honest... ...I don't know if I really want it to be. It's not just your husband. You're a patient's sister. It's doesn't feel right. I understand. Well, goodbye. What are you doing? I have to go. No, don't go. Don't go. It's not that late. I just want you to understand something about Diana before I leave. I think I do. After my father raped her... ...our mother left us. I tried to get her away from him, but I couldn't. That's okay. No, you don't know everything. There was a fire. My father died in it. The police thought Diana had something to do with it. But I made it... I made it clear she didn't. I just think she's blocked it all out. I don't really know whether that's good or bad. It's neither. It's just something... ...something else... ...we gotta work out. I really do have to go. Jimmy? Heather, honey. It's after 11. Where have you been? I thought you were... We finished early. I came home. You weren't here. I missed you. I had this thing to do for Diana. The next time I go away... ...you come with me. You look tired, honey. You really gotta take better care of yourself. Look at this. I didn't have one gray hair... ...not one... ...until I married you. You can't even see that unless you're looking under a magnifying glass, Jimmy. Think I'm afraid? Of what? Of you. That you won't love me when I'm an old man. Of course I will. But just not until then, huh, baby? I didn't say that. Of course not. You don't have to say. You don't have to speak. We understand each other so well, darling. I thought the workout would relax me, but I'm still on edge. I could get you a drink. It's a little late for a drink. Why are you standing there? Do it. I don't want to. You heard me. I know you heard me. Now do it. Slower. Let's talk about you and Heather. Why? Because she's more interesting? How do you mean "interesting"? I had the dream again. I'm arranging flowers on a table as a centerpiece. I decorate the flowerpot with fancy paper. The paper feels like velvet. I have three kinds of flowers. Lilies, carnations... - And the third kind? - Violence. Violence? I didn't say violence! I said violates! I said violets. Violets. They're just flowers. I once did floral arranging. Does everything have to be about sex? Why don't we talk a little about... ...the fancy paper? "It feels like velvet. " You'd say it symbolizes pubic hair. I knew you'd say something disgusting! You said it. So what do we do? Just keep doing this. It's good. You wanna know how the dream ends? Everything... ...everything goes up in flames. The flowers... ...the table... ...just one great big fireball. Then I wake up. I've been treating this attractive, seductive young woman. She's got an older sister who happens to be married. We've met a few times to discuss family history. Then we... You didn't sleep with her? I went through the AMA's Principles of Ethics. Even the special annotations for psychiatry said nothing about it. It's a clich, a shrink with a weakness for an unhappy woman. I didn't say that. You didn't have to. "She chooses he who must choose her. " Now you're gonna tell me you have feelings for her. Honestly, I can't stop thinking about her. You know as well as I do, romantic love is a projection. You're not seeing this woman. It's a vision of her. You're delusional. I'm not. Yes, it is delusional. There is no human being, no woman is so beautiful... ...so special that all of your normal thought patterns get... Can I help you? The receptionist said I'd find you here. This is Alan Lowenthal, my colleague. And my conscience. Pleased to meet you. - Have a seat. - No, I didn't mean to interrupt you. No problem. You were saying? That I'm late for my rounds? Nice to meet you. So you cure any crazies today, or what? No, but I did receive this lovely set of original drawings... ...created by a personal friend of the president of Bantar. That's the planet. There is a theme here. It seems that Satan and I have much in common... ...and that I must die. How sweet. I didn't want you to leave last night. I know. I'm sorry. He doesn't mean anything to me. I'll find a way out of it. I've wanted to for a long time. Now I have a reason. Check out a guy for me. Through the DA's office, maybe. "A guy"? Maybe a bad guy. Name's Jimmy Evans. - Builds public housing. - Who is he? That's what I want to find out. Somebody's husband. She's trying to get out of it. That's the problem. They always try to get out of it, but they never get out. Trust me. This is a good thing. This is life-affirming, positive energy. Everything you hate. If I hate it, it's gotta be all right. You know what I love about this place? I'll tell you. You take away the prices and all the polite bullshit and it's just... ...good food. Plus, we won't see any of my friends here. Don't you like your friends? I make good money off those greedy fuckers. And when that stops, the friendship stops. What do you care if they heard? Think their shit don't stink? You can be so crude! Yes, I can. But you need that. You don't like it, but you need it. But you need it... ...to get off. What do you think you're doing? - I was just gonna have a little sip. - You mean another sip. So? So, you forget the last time you had "a sip"? You got way out of hand. I had one good time once, and I got way out of hand? It's more than once. I think you're right. I think it was twice. Excuse me! Perfect! I'm holding these reservations two weeks, two fucking weeks... ...and you take tonight to grow a wild hair up your ass. Thank you very much. Fuck off! Jesus Christ! You kill me. One more... ...and that's it. Heather, put it down. That's enough! Put it down. Look at me. I'm chewing on a pancreas. A pancreas is a gland, for chrissakes. A tasty gland, but it's a fucking gland. What's wrong? I'm dizzy. I don't feel well. I have to go to the bathroom. Come right back. I saw that, you bastard! Don't look in his eyes! He'll burn your soul! Can't you smell it? Burning bodies everywhere! Burning flesh! Don't look at him! Don't! He'll burn you! Get away! Don't touch her! - I'm Dr. Lee. - What's wrong with her? - She has pathological intoxication. - What? Pathological intoxication. Her chart shows she came here last year after a similar incident. But she had even less to drink this time. People with this syndrome have a dramatic, often violent... ...response to small amounts of alcohol and never remember a thing. She's in here. Jesus! Get her home and let her sleep off the shot. And keep her away from alcohol in any form. Do you understand? Yes, thank you, doctor. We're out of here. You're damaged goods. But you're also my wife. And if you ever... ...embarrass me like that again... ...I'll fucking kill you. You come here a lot? Just in moments of existential angst... ...or to impress a date. - What was that? - I don't know. We're in a ditch. We're gonna have to spend the night here. Don't even! Great, isn't it? You sure it's okay? Yeah, I've got a special doctor's pass. Amazing, isn't it? I don't know, Isaac. Come on. Okay. Almost there. This is it. This is it. I want you to know something. What's that? It's the first day I've played hooky in two years. Impressed? No. Jesus Christ! It never happened before! - Come on! - What is this? It's for protection. There are a lot of lunatics out there. Protection. Come down here. You want to talk about this? No. So how bad is it? Jimmy Evans... ...born Dmitri Evangalou... ...September, whatever, 19... Doesn't matter. Emigrated Athens at 18 to avoid the draft. The man builds buildings. Supplemented by the occasional pension-fund scam... ...bid rigging... ...money laundering. Fucking around with his wife is like... ...teasing King Kong. He isn't invisible. There's a federal task force looking into this character. I'd stop seeing the girl. I don't know if I can. She's not the kind of girl you stop seeing. So this cocksucker, he says to me... ..."I've got too much sand in my concrete. Remember the buildings in the Armenian earthquake?" And I'm thinking, "Why are you worried? This is not Armenia... ...this is San Francisco. " Was that a look? Were you giving me a look? No, I wasn't looking at you. I was looking at your wife. My wife. I don't like people looking at my wife. And I certainly don't like being looked at. You understand? Now you no-dicks over at Justice either indict me... ...or stay off my ass. Because if I catch you even glancing my way again... ...you'll lose your eyeballs. That'll solve your legal problems. Maybe not. Maybe not. Where are you going? I don't feel well. I'm gonna get a cab. Fine, whatever. What do you think you were doing in there? I just had to see him for myself. He thought I was with the Justice Department. Do I dress that bad? You're crazy. - You are. - Maybe. Probably. How did you get away from him? I don't feel well. I told him I was gonna catch a cab. I'll drive you. I have to stop at the drugstore. Do you mind? Wake up my driver. Where've you been? I stopped at the drugstore. You stopped at the drugstore? All this hypersensitivity of one's own body. "I feel stressed. I have a headache. " The simple fact of the matter is, honey... ...you don't treat your body right. I'm sick. You're sick. She says, "I'm sick. " Tell me something I don't know. It's late. I know how to make you feel better. Take off your clothes. Take off your clothes. I don't think you heard me. That's my girl. I said, take off... - How are you? - What'll we do? I don't know. I do not know. Tell me what happened. They found him dead. Jimmy. With his head crushed. Jimmy's dead? Crushed. Why are you here? I'm her doctor. Really? - Let's go. - You'll be okay? I'll be right back. You all right? Can you tell me what happened? Did he attack you? No, it wasn't like that. We were just talking and... A fight, nothing unusual. Then I... I just snapped, like all those other times. What do you mean, all these other times? Something happens when I drink. It's horrible. I become... I don't know what I become because I never can remember. Have you seen any doctors about this? Did they diagnose it? Did they call it...? Could you remember if...? Pathological intoxication... Does that mean anything to you? I don't know. Maybe. Had you been drinking last night? No, I can't drink. What did you do? I was feeling really sick. I took some cough medicine and went in... Wait. You had cough medicine? How much did you have? I don't know. Quite a bit. You saw how I was feeling. You know this stuff can be like 20, 25% alcohol. I'm not crazy. No one's gonna believe that I... You did get this diagnosed, did you not? You were treated for this. One time at Mount Zion... ...and twice at Stockton. You have a lawyer? I don't have anything. First we'll get you out of here. We'll go to a hospital... ...and get you a proper examination. Then we'll get you a lawyer. When you tell me it's lost, it's lost. And it can stay lost. I don't want some bag lady to show up with a dumbbell she found in a dumpster. Fucks up our momentum. Tell me about your husband's will. What about it? Is there anything I should know? Is this necessary? I've got to get into this, Ike. The DA is certainly gonna. Goes to motive. My husband was broke. Gambling debts, junk bonds... He said I'd never get a cent. He carry life insurance? That would go to his brother. Anthony. He lives in Greece someplace. I don't really know. All right. I'm through. Everything's gonna be okay. I'll be right there. Thanks. Listen, Mike. Something you should know. I was the last one who saw her that night. I drove her home. I drove her home. Then I left. Anyone see you? I don't think so. Then the lady went home alone. This is an open-and-shut case. I would do it myself, but... But Dr. Barr's been... What's the word? Schtupping the accused. What? I didn't say it right? I'm uncomfortable with that also. I don't know. I've never testified at a big trial. If anything, I'm a prosecution man. Which increases your credibility as a defense witness. - But there's a killing, police... - Alan, come on! They tried to prosecute the guy for ages! True. Haven't you noticed the birds are chirping more melodiously? The children's laughter is brighter? America is just a nicer country without that slimeball. I'm not stupid. I know why you're determined to suck me into this. What? Several years ago, I published a study in the Journal of General Psychiatry. Isaac never mentioned that to you? Is it in paperback? You may proceed with your opening statement. The defense will tell you that... ...Mrs. Evans was under the influence... ...of this or that when she killed her husband. They'll bring in so-called experts... ...to say that she wasn't in her right mind. But, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...we're here to try a woman... ...who, on a lovely spring night... ...in the sanctity... ...of the apartment that she shared with her husband... ...waited until he turned his back... ...and then savagely... ...swung a heavy dumbbell... ...at his head. Boy! That was impressive. Wasn't it? Though I think Raymond Burr did it first... ...in the movie A Place in the Sun, with an oar. But what Mr. Brakhage didn't say... ...was that the dumbbell... ...is not the object that killed Jimmy Evans! The actual dumbbell was never recovered. If indeed it even was a dumbbell. You see... ...whatever object was used... ...whatever really happened... ...in that bathroom... ...on that lovely spring night... ...can never be known beyond a reasonable doubt... ...because... ...Heather Evans... ...has no memory of the events of that night. Is anybody home? Look, I'm sorry to barge in on you like this, but we got a little... ...just a little bit of a... Hanging with a buddy of mine from the DA's office, right? - We had a few cocktails. - No kidding. The DA's expert witness? Cohagen. I'm not worried about it. They were just sandbagging us with him. The star is waiting in the wings. Who? Dr. Grusin. Dr. Grusin, remember? Oh, God. Does Alan know? Don't tell him. He's nervous enough. Don't you tell him! He's nervous enough as it is. Dr. Grusin... ...have you examined Heather Evans? Yes, I have. And did you find her to be suffering from any illness... ...that would impair her normal functioning? No, I did not. What about pathological intoxication? I found no evidence of it, whatsoever. I doubt that anyone but a defense attorney would either. Objection, Your Honor! Move to strike. Sustained. The jury will disregard the witness' last statement. Why do you doubt the existence of so-called pathological intoxication? Discussion of this disorder... ...is simply an attempt to dazzle a jury... ...with pseudo-scientific jargon... ...to convince them that alcohol exerts magic... ...evil powers on the brains of a few people. Objection! The witness is stating an opinion. Nothing more. That's the reason she's here. She's an expert witness. Overruled. Why pseudo-scientific, doctor? No one has ever shown any physical evidence... ...of pathological intoxication. - What would constitute physical evidence? - A brain scan. Genetic profile, analysis of blood chemistry. Things that can be tested. Thank you. Your witness. Have you examined Heather Evans' emergency-room medical records... ...from Mount Zion Hospital and Stockton Hospital? Of course. What were the doctors' conclusions? Pathological intoxication. But based on my experience in this area, I have to disagree. Your experience in this area? Tell me, how many patients have you treated with pathological intoxication? I have testified on direct as to my doubts that this... ..."illness" exists. Therefore, how can I be expected to have... Try and answer the question. How many such patients have you treated? I haven't treated any. - I have evaluated patients who claim... - All right then. How many such patients have you evaluated? Two. Two. I have no more questions for the "expert" witness. This court is adjourned until tomorrow. Hey, Hector. It's a bitch, huh? Never thought we'd see her up there. Heather's not taking the stand. How much alcohol must be consumed... ...to produce this severe psychotic reaction... ...in a person with pathological intoxication? Only a very sm... In my experience, only a very small amount of alcohol is needed... ...for a severe reaction. How long does a reaction last? Generally, a few hours. Can a person with this illness remember the episode? They don't recall the incidents. Yet a person suffering from pathological intoxication... ...may otherwise show no evidence of mental disorder? In my experience... ...I would say that's correct. Thank you. Your witness. You repeatedly make reference to your experience... ...with this obscure disorder. How many patients with this condition... ...have you actually treated? During my fellowship training at the Stanford Psychiatric Institute... ...I had the opportunity to... Excuse me. - Conduct a study of pathological intoxication. My findings were published in the Journal of General Psychiatry. In all, there were 87 patients involved. Did any of these 87 patients... Excuse me? Did any of these 87 patients beat their spouses to death? Oh, dear God, no! Thank you. No further questions. Request opportunity for redirect. Proceed. Can you tell us what some of them did in the psychotic phase of their illness? Didn't one of them slash her wrists? Yes. Didn't one break her son's arm? One of them threw himself in front of a BART train. Lost a leg. It's all there in my paper. Thank you, doctor. I get the lady off, you owe me one. How about fixing me up with her sister? Very, very sick man. - What can I do? - Jury's back! Mr. Foreman, have you reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. "We, the jury, find the defendant, Heather Evans... ...not responsible by reason of temporary insanity... ...due to pathological intoxication. " Quiet! Be seated in this courtroom! She is to remain in the custody of the Overland Hospital... ...for further examination and observation... ...until it is confirmed that she represents no danger to anyone... ...and that she no longer... ...suffers from active dangerous mental disorders. This court is adjourned. Hello, Dr. Barr. Hi, Diana. So how long do you think I have to stay in here? The law says it could be indefinite. But if your evaluation goes fine, you can be out of here... ...in six to eight weeks. But that's two months. You did kill your husband. I'm gonna get myself on this evaluation committee. So hopefully that'll guarantee a minimum stay here. All right. Thank you. For everything. Sure. Everyone has heard Freud's rhetorical question: "Women... ...what do they want?" Elsewhere, Freud refers to the female sex... ...as "the dark continent. " In his Interpretation of Dreams... ...the man who gave the world "penis envy"... ...declares that women's libido is essentially masochistic. The evidence? Well, it's buried deep in chapter six. A patient, dreaming about arranging a floral centerpiece... ...has the poor taste to mix violets with lilies... ...and carnations. The lilies represent purity... ...the carnations, carnal desire. And of course last, but not least... ...the violets... ...standing in for a woman's unconscious need to be violated. Violently... ...wouldn't you know? But I would like to paraphrase the good doctor... ...and say that sometimes a violet is just a violet. And what of the table on which they're laid? Forgive the expression. Sit down. Can I talk to you a minute? During the trial, you said something strange. "I never thought we'd see her up there. " It's none of my business, seeing how she's your friend. That's okay. What did you mean by that? It's just that a guy like me, married as I am, notices women like that. Even with her sunglasses and scarf on. What are you talking about? She sat in the back row a couple of times last year. Last year? When you were testifying. It looked like she was hanging on your every word. I'm glad for you... ...that she got off. Woman's really something. She's really something. Okay. Thanks a lot, Stan. Not good. Let me guess. Jimmy's brother was never sole beneficiary? No, he was. Right before he checked out a month before the murder. Bone cancer. That's about the time I met her. At that point, Heather became the sole beneficiary. How much? The policy was for 2 million. But since she was found not responsible, they have to pay double because... ...technically... ...the whole thing was an accident. She's gonna walk out of Overland 4 million richer than when she walked in. I knew I should've taken this case for a piece of the action. - I want to see Heather. - It's way past visiting hours. I don't care. - The patients are secured... - Now! What's going on? Why did you do it? What? Why did you do it? Do what? Just tell me that... ...that it evolved. The plan. Because you were... ...desperate, because of the emotional... ...and psychological torture. Tell me that... Tell me anything. Just don't say it was for the money. Not something as cold as that. Isaac, this is crazy. This is crazy. It's also very clever. You are a very clever woman. You sent me your sister... ...for help. Very concerned, very compassionate. It was all lies. Diana told me. You watched me! You came to court, watched me testify! You auditioned me, like for a part! No, she didn't. She didn't tell you a thing. Diana told me everything. Do you remember that little lead pipe you held at the lighthouse? It was the handle to a dumbbell. The dumbbell. Don't fuck with me, Isaac! Or I'll have to prove you killed Jimmy. I would've done anything for you. Jesus, what I did for you! Dr. Barr. Detective. You look upset. Could use a shower too. How's Heather? What can I do for you? How's Heather? She's fine. Anthony Evangalou. Ring a bell? Jimmy Evans' older brother. See, last I heard... ...he was supposed to collect on Jimmy's life insurance. I do a little digging... ...find out the man's taking a dirt nap underneath the Parthenon. Ain't gonna get shit! Hey, what did she tell you? She ain't gonna share the 4 million with you? I got a report due in the morning. Don't yank my dick! The night of the murder... ...a stud enters the building with her. Hinky thing. No one sees this stud walk out. Interesting lead. Follow up on it. Doorman's a pillhead on parole. Even if he I.D.'d, in court it would be worth zip. You think it was me? At this juncture... ...I know it was. The expert witness is your friend. The lawyer's your best friend. The sister's your patient, and you're banging the accused. Now, if you were me... ...what would you think? Are you arresting me? Without a murder weapon, I can't do jack. I want to go home, take that shower. You do that. Sorry I'm late. You look really nice. Thank you. You're seeing Isaac later? What did you tell him? Tell him? About us. I told him the dream. The one we picked. And? And that's all. Why? He's leading you on. What are you talking about? You love him. - I don't know what you mean. - It's okay. It happens between patients and doctors all the time. - I just don't want you to get hurt. - I'm not going to. He knows everything. He said you told him everything. Oh, my God! I didn't tell him shit! I didn't tell him anything! I just want you to keep in mind... ...if I go down, you go down with me. He won't let this go. Not unless we persuade him to. Are you gonna help me... ...or not? Let's talk about how your father died. You promised me that whatever Heather said about my parents, you'd tell me. Yes, I did. That's right. What did she say? That your father raped you. More than once. Anything else? That he was killed... ...in a fire. My father was... Died smoking in bed... ...drunk. I can still smell the liquor. Think I had something to do with that? I wasn't suggesting that. I don't think I had anything to do with that. - I'm really worried about Heather. - Why is that? You saw her at the hospital. She looked awful. She looked like a crazy person, don't you think? Of course, she's under so much stress. So much stress... ...can manifest... ...in very bizarre ways. Lies? Yes, lies. I wish there was something we could do... ...to help Heather. That is, if you're still interested in helping Heather. Good morning. So what do you think... ...now that we can talk... ...about the way I am... ...and what I did? What would a shrink call somebody like me? Remember, Heather... ...your confinement is indefinite. I'm on the committee that evaluates you every six months. And there is a very compelling argument that you belong in here. Planning a murder for nearly two years. Waiting for Jimmy's brother to die. I'd call that pathological. Have you forgotten? I still have the dumbbell. I haven't forgotten that. Tomorrow at noon... ...I'm bringing two assistant DAs here. They'll want to hear your story... ...and mine. But I've already been found not responsible. Haven't you ever heard of double jeopardy? I can't be tried twice for the same crime, now, can I? Then you have nothing to worry about. See you at noon tomorrow. I gather you've heard his version. Maybe you're ready for the truth. Of course, Miss Evans. I've invited my sister. She'll corroborate my story. Let Miss Evans' sister in as soon as she arrives. In the meantime, why don't we begin? I should have a lawyer here, but... ...my lawyer is his best friend. I tried to replace him, but the judge wouldn't let me. Recently, I've been found to be temporarily insane... ...so I have to defend myself, on my own. We'll listen carefully and impartially to whatever you have to tell us. My sister's a patient of his... ...and we've met a few times... ...to talk about family business. In the course of doing that... ...we started an affair. The first time Isaac ever said anything about killing my husband... ...I thought he was joking. He knew I suffered from pathological intoxication. But he became obsessed! He insisted that we had the... ...the makings of a perfect murder. He followed me home one night. He followed me home one night and... He acted really... ...agitated... ...and upset. I tried to make him leave, but he wouldn't. He went upstairs and he did it. He hit Jimmy. Isaac hit Jimmy with a dumbbell. I was horrified. I think he was horrified too. Because he ran. He ran right out of the apartment... ...and he called me. He called me in about five minutes and... ...from a bar... ...or someplace, and he told me... He told me to tell the police... ...that I had done it... ...after sipping cough syrup. I did. I hid the dumbbell... ...for Isaac. I know it was wrong to conceal the evidence. But I was so scared. So I got my sister... I got my sister to bring the briefcase today. It's okay, you can give it to him. It's okay. What's that? Where's the dumbbell? Where's the dumbbell? He's controlling her! He made her substitute those for the dumbbell! They're from the planet Bantar, right? How did he get you to do it? You're fucking her, aren't you? Bastard! Answer me! Answer me! Answer me! You don't understand. They're framing me. They're both in on it. Of course, Miss Evans. You're doctors? You know we're doctors. You're just confused now. - I'm with the review committee. - I consult for the insurance company. - You liars! - You're very upset, Miss Evans. You tricked me! All of you tricked me! Hold it. Hold on. I think I can reach her. You're in it together! It's okay. It's all right. It's fine. You were right about double jeopardy. This was the only way. You cocksucking son of a bitch! You bastard! Fuck you all! Fuck you all! You lied to me! Let go of me! Fuck you! When you came to us the other day with your diagnosis, we were skeptical. There was no indication of psychosis. There's no prior history. She's worse than you described her. Talk about paranoid. What did she think we were? District attorneys? The anxiety of killing her husband, plus the repeated insults of alcohol... ...have brought on a full-scale organic psychosis. I wouldn't be surprised if there's further deterioration. Why don't we do a review in six months and take it from there? We appreciate you taking the time. We know how these cases can drag on. Patients remain confined for years. Good morning. Caterpillar's become a butterfly. May I get you something to drink? Champagne cocktail. Your hair. Do you like it? They're extensions. I hope you're not uncomfortable here. It's so nice to see you away from the office. How did you know you could win me over? The dream. Why did you choose a dream from the archives? My dreams are none of your business. You were hoping that I would recognize it. You wanted me to intervene. I just can't seem to get off your couch, can I, Dr. Barr? I don't know what's going on in your mind. But whatever it is that... ...I could have done... ...whatever I might have implied, whatever you... ...imagined, I'm sorry. It's just not gonna happen. Fear of intimacy? What do you think? Is that a problem? I want you to understand this. Heather and me... ...you and me... ...it's finished. It's over. - Gone. - But you're my doctor! I can't be your doctor... ...or anything else. What I can do, and will do, is find you another therapist. I should've done it months ago. There is something that I need from you. I need the dumbbell. The dumbbell? It's gone. I got rid of it. I threw it in the bay. All right. Well, I will be... ...giving you a call very soon... ...with a new doctor's name. I think it's best if we just say goodbye now. Let's say it then. What are you gonna do to me? Why? Because of what I did to you. I love you. I love you. Tell me about Isaac. You were right. He doesn't care about me. He doesn't even want to be my doctor. It's okay. We have one more chance. You've got to get the dumbbell to Huggins. No, I can't. I can't touch it. I can't sleep with it in the apartment. I can't. I just... Heather, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for what I've done to you. Maybe there is something you can do to make up for it. All visitors, please clear the day room. Excuse me, miss. You forgot your purse. She has it? Diana has the dumbbell? Yeah, I can see her from here. She's got it. She's putting it in a bag. If you could possibly grab it, give me a call. I'll pick it up from you. No problem. How did it go? I have it. That's great. I can be there in 15, 20 minutes, tops. - You know where I am? - 7th and King. And you're all right? Thanks. I'll be right over. Yeah, I'll be here. Wrong girl, pal. - Homicide. - Detective Huggins, please. If it's not one thing, it's a damn 'nother. Hello, detective. This is Heather Evans. I have that item you've been looking for. I thought you were still in Overland. I got a pass. I've got what you want. I'm at the Bay Marina. I won't be here longer than 40 minutes. Bay Marina? I know it. I'll be there. I heard this boom, but I didn't think nothing of it. We hear that all the time around here. - You know him? - What happened? Took a pill in the chest. Small caliber. - Pepe, can you hear me? - He's stabilized. Can you hear me? Hold on a second. Bay Marina. Gone 20 minutes, maybe. Got the pipe, doc. She got the pipe. He'll be okay. You're gonna be all right. - Easy. - You'll be all right. All right, let's go. I can't believe it. If I hadn't got stuck on Market... ...I'd have beat those fuckers. That's life, right? How fast can you get me across the bay? Fast. Shit! Damn it! I got it. They say your buddy's in surgery. He's gonna make it. Thanks. This ought to be good. This is the dumbbell Heather used to kill her husband. I guess I shouldn't have touched it. You're a smart fucker, aren't you? There's a shooting victim at Overland who can positively I.D. Her. Get in the car. Listen to me, lady. Both of you. Get in the car! This is kidnapping, sweetheart. One great big old felony. But I tell you what. I'll make you a deal. I don't think you understand. I don't need any deal. Right now, I'm locked up in a hospital, far from what's going to happen. You'll both be found dead. Your prints on the dumbbell, his on his gun. Nobody will know what happened. You remember when we were here? That meant nothing. Nothing! Maybe. Maybe not. Diana's dream was a lie. What you told me about the fire did mean something, didn't it? It was about your father... ...and you. It was you your father raped. More than once. You couldn't take that. You snapped... ...and then you killed him. Because he passed out drunk that night... ...soaked in booze... ...all you had to do was strike a match. Maybe he deserved to die. Maybe Jimmy did too. It's over. It's really over. Give me the gun. It's over. It's not over! You think you can shrink me like one of your fucking patients? You think that makes me feel better? I don't give a shit about you or my father! I don't give a shit about anything! You'll kill both of us. I'm gonna kill you first. Down here! The window! You all right? Were you surprised by the not-guilty verdict? Do you feel you were unjustly tried as an accomplice? Amazing! Diana was Heather's accomplice. Everybody bought it. Especially the jury. It made sense, didn't it? Heather was the one who actually committed the crimes. Diana was unstable... ...victimized by her older sister. It's perfect. Too bad I didn't represent her. You ever think maybe you picked the wrong sister? I want to know everything about you, Heather. The first thing you should know about me is I'm an only child. Now you've got me. To us. I'm really not supposed to drink. Maybe just one sip.
