Mandi and I spent many nights... waking from our drunken slumber on that grassy knoll at Bondi. - How was it? - Yeah. It was wild out there. Yeah? [ Bijou ] Here we go. We're looking at some lovely locals. Kind ofhot if you're into that, uh, pasty adolescent thing. Who else have we got here? Where are these girls from? Looks like the United States of''Generica. '' Hmm. Everyone's got a median average right now... of about 2.00. She looks like she's from the northern beaches. Ah, the skinhead tattoo look. Always attractive on the beach.

Nice to meet you, buddy. Look just like your older brother. - Ah, that's what they say. - It's kind of scary. Not necessarily a good thing. [ Colby ] Bijou.

I got it. - Check out Mikey. [ Colby ] Are they hitting it off or what? Can you see 'em? [ Mandi ] Wow. She just polished offher drink. [ Colby ] Oh, he owes me big time. Look at that. - Oh, my- - They're stripping- - Please. - I think our work is done here. You ready to go? - Go, BijouI - Go, MikeyI You're the man. Okay. This is Colby's therapy service. Here with my client Mikey... uh, who has just met a very lovely woman named Bijou. He's not my usual type of guy. I'm very pleased with the body. Um, the mind is sometimes absent. And that's good too. I- I like my skinny rock-and-roll boys. Put it that way. - Okay. - I like my boys who are, you know- So maybe if you didn't feed him for a week. Maybe if I didn't feed him for a week, uh- She's crazy. She is crazy. But I'm kind of crazy too, so it makes for a good match. - Gorgeous guy, by the way. - You like that one? - Yes. Congratulations, young lady. - Good. Thank you. Before I met her, I'd get up at, like, 5:00 every morning... - run two- two- like, two miles on the beach- - Okay. and then I'd go in, you know, have some coffee... and then I'd go out and surf for a couple hours. With Mandi, I don't need that, uh, cardiovascular activity. I'm just, uh, you know, using him for sex. So what you're saying is she lasts long. - I'm saying the sex is insane. It's insane. - That's great. It's not how- how he comes across to the world. It's- It's-It's-It's kind of what he's got going on kind of inside him, I guess. I'm a butt man. And she's got- she's got- - Voluptuous is the word, I think. - Yeah. She's banging. I have a nickname for his schlong. We're pretty open, sexually. So, uh, you know, we do some role-playing. Open as in you'd be open to me joining you? What? That? No, no. That wouldn't- That wouldn't be acceptable. So, do you trust him? Not more than I trust myself. But Bijou, on the other hand- she could jump in. Does he look good naked? - That would be fun. - I'm okay with that, actually. I'm not selfish. I share. You trust him as much as you trust yourself. That's interesting. - No, I just made that up. - Oh. So- So, what's this thing with Mikey and some guy in a bar? [ Bijou ] Mikey served this guy at a bar... whose best friend is a helicopter pilot. And he said that he was flying over New Guinea... and he spotted this, like, 7 0-year-old bearded white guy. [ Blowing ] There's not a scratch here. Forget the lens. I want to hear about this Michael Rockefeller business. It's just a- a theory. - Whose theory? Mikey's? - Yeah. Mikey and I. He met this- this pilot at the bar whose friend saw... this 7 0-year-old man in custody of- Hey. He didn't say ''in the custody of' though. Oh. Whatever. With these New Guinean warriors on a riverbank. It all checks out. You should read about Michael Rockefeller on the Internet. There's all kinds of books written on him. [ Colby ] About time, Mikey. What up? You got it? Okay. Let me check this out. ''The Mystery of Michael Rockefeller. '' You found it. - Taking care ofbusiness. - You stole- Dude, the card is still in here. All right. Now, here is the book... that I so thoughtfully procured with, uh, my accomplice Colby: The Mystery of Michael Rockefeller. - Procured. Good word. - Yes. Okay. There he is, Michael Rockefeller. - Can I see? - Check him out, girls. - He looks like a beatnik. - ''1961. ''Twenty-three-year-old Michael Rockefeller... boat capsized off the coast of New Guinea.'' - Uh, that's right on. It's right- - Yeah. And just to kind of throw this in there. There's been a huge mystery, like, legend around the guy for the last 30 years. Multiple sightings in New Guinea, uh, of a white dude with a big beard. Sometimes spectacles. Yeah. It says Rockefeller family offered $1 00,000... for any- any whereabouts- any information on his whereabouts in 1 961 . So wait. He was- He was our age when he went missing. - Yeah. - Yeah. So he'd be in his 60s now. Yeah. Sixty-five, 7 0. So, I think the most popularly held belief... is that he was captured by ''cannibals'' and eaten. No. That's just one of the beliefs. I still think he's alive and kicking it. They actually prefer the taste of meat... that is still on the flesh of a human that is living. Oh. I would too. They actually keep them alive. They go limb by limb. - Uh-huh? - I've got good loin. - [ Colby ] Be a shitty way to go. - Yeah. If you're gonna eat something, keep it fresh. [ Colby ] So, we gonna do this or what? Look. We're all here. Right? We're all having a good time. I don't know why we have to pick up and move. Hey, you know, this morning when you were surfing with Colby... Hey, you know, this morning when you were surfing with Colby... I decided to check Michael Rockefeller out on the Internet. just sounds a little crazy to me. The Rockefeller family themselves have already claimed his death. Surviving 45 years out in the jungle? I- I don't think so. They have more money than us. More manpower. More- More expertise. More knowledge. They hired the best anthropologists from the best universities in the U.S. Maybe- Maybe it's not that implausible, you know. Maybe- Maybe he's still alive. And even if he is, who says he wants to be found? I mean, there's- there's people that- that live in really remote areas for years and years. Think about it. This guy was born into the lap of privilege. Maybe he didn't want to belong to it anymore. Maybe he wanted to pursue something a lot more simple... a lot more pure, a lot more precious. You know, each to his own. Maybe he's still out there. Maybe it's a mystery for a reason. Who gives a shit about Michael Rockefeller anymore? A lot of people. He was one of the biggest stories of the last century. -It's one of the biggest stories of the last century. -He was in Life magazine. He was in Life magazine. There was three television specials. - Three television specials. - There's, like, 1 0 books about him. - Ten books. - I think they're making a movie in Hollywood right now. They're making a movie about him in Hollywood right now. I guarantee you. We go there, we find him, we film him, we interview him- We can sell it to the tabloids for at least a million bucks. A million bucks? We divide it four ways? What's that? $250,000 would be kind of cool, actually. [ Sighs ] I think our intentions are completely out of whack. I mean, what are we pursuing? We're pursuing money. You know, I could buy that gold Trans Am I've always been after. You know, the one with the- with the eagle on the hood. - I like it. - Now let's take it for a test drive. Well, my instincts say no, but, uh- What does the crystal ball say, hmm? Let's go to Papua New Guinea. I'm in if you're in. First off, we're in the South Pacific. This is Australia. This is Fiji. And the island of New Guinea has two parts: - Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya. - Mm-hmm. So one is independent, and one is Indonesian control. So we're gonna sail across from Suva, Fiji... to Port Moresby, which is the port of entry. So, from there we're gonna drive across to the border... to get to Irian Jaya. [ Colby ] Now that we're going on this trip together... we have to ask each other the five questions to truth. - Rate your relationship with your parents, one to five. - Five. - Three. - One. I don't consider myself to have had parents. - [ Mandi ] Do you think you'll achieve your goals in life? - If I make some. - Yes. - Definitely. - Yeah. - [ Bijou ] On an average Sunday afternoon... do you prefer sobriety or intoxication? - Intoxication all the way. - Sobriety. - Sobriety. - Intoxication. [ Bijou ] Have you ever had a satisfactory relationship with the opposite sex? - Not yet. - Yeah. - Don't even try. - No. Not even close. - [ Mikey ] Do you believe in God? - No. No. Yes. [ Chuckles ] - Only if she's a woman. - I believe that God is an excuse for weak people. - Okay. We've got the mosquito repellant. - [ Mandi ] Check. - The sunscreen. - Check. - First aid. - Check. - Uh, poncho we're gonna need. - Check. - Where's the second camera? - Here. Take this. Take this one. It's, um- It's, uh- Shit. - Oh. Here. Here. Here. I got it. I got it. Got it. - Okay. We have to have this. We need to put it in a plastic bag. - Like waterproof it, right? - Yeah. - And don't forget to pack the G.P.S. - Okay. - God. - [ Colby ] God. They're not done yet? Hey! I am so excited! - Mr. Colby. - [ Colby ] Easy. Welcome, guys. - Hey. Hello. - Bijou's working on the packing. - In the meantime, I've prepared a few drinks. - Oh, God. - That's the bigger one. That'll be mine. - We're leaving in the morning. - And we will leave drunk. - So we are getting an early. - That's a brilliant game plan. - Uh- - More than brilliant. It's the only way to travel. - The only way. - Okay. All right. - Down the hatch. Guys, to alcoholic-fueled adventure. [ All ] To the journey! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! I'm carving our initials. Come. Come. Come. - [ Colby ] Jesus. - What's your last name? So, if he was taken by cannibals, I can't understand why he hasn't been eaten yet. - It's in the chapter before that. - What? Where? These guys-They're so isol- They've never seen other races. So they see a Caucasian or whatever, they think these people are, like, sorcerers. I mean, there's all kinds of stories from World War II. These P.O.W.s. Yeah. OneJapanese guy they kept alive for, like, 1 5 years or something. - [ Sighs ] How we doing, Captain? - Yeah. We're going good. Past Vanuatu,Tles Banks, Santa Cruz Islands, Guadalcanal. [ Colby ] Come on, guys. Check it out. - Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. - [ Bijou ] WhooI - FinallyI - [ Bijou ] Who's your papa?

This is the most beautiful face you've ever seen. And Bijou can attest to it. And the most beautiful ass. - judo chopI All right. Here. - Give me this. Give me this. - Enough filming for me. Get these ships. Get these. - [ Bijou ] MikeI [ Ship Horn Blows ] [ Colby ] Oh, there's my beautiful baby. There she is. - [ Mikey ] By the way, that is not a car. - Mandi! - That is horrible. - Guys! Like our ride? - Look. - This is horrible. - It's cool. - Sport package. All-wheel drive. [ Mikey ] If we spent more than $200 budget on-on the-the ghetto van. [ Bijou ] Mikey, what do you say? Huh? Cool ride. - Mikey, come check out the interior of this bitch. - I could've stolen a better car. They play in skirts? [ Mikey ] Wow. Look at this. The stadium's packed. We gotta get in on this. [ Colby ] Wow. Like the Port Moresby Coliseum. [ Bijou Chuckles ] So, um, what's this guy's name? [ Mikey ] john. He's an American. [ Colby ] You said he's been flying in Papua New Guinea for five years? - [ Mikey ] Yep. - We need the G.P.S. coordinates where he saw the old man. Damn straight. I want to know where we're going. [ Sighs ] - [ Colby ] We're a little late. - [ Mikey ] Yeah. - They don't have watches here. Doesn't matter. - [ Colby ] Is that him there? - [ Mikey ] I think so. [ Chuckles ] Look at this guy. - Hey, Mikey? - Yeah. - [ Bijou ] Hi. - Did you bring a map? - [ Colby ] You got the map? - Bijou. Map. - Yeah. Go. Ah. Got it. No.Just you. [ Colby ] What did- What did he say? [ Bijou ] Said stay here. Mikey's in his commando mode.

We're solid. - [ Colby ] It was definitely him? - Yeah, definitely him. Right here at this meeting. The river. Saw a 7 0-year-old white man. And we're good. It's legit, man. - Let's just get back in the car. We'll sort it out later. - Give me the map. Read this. Okay. ''Papua New Guinea travel advisory. 4530.'' Okay. Uh, ''Criminals have been known to place children or other obstructions in the roadway... ''to cause vehicles to stop. ''Once stopped, armed men rob the occupants and steal the car. The risk of serious personal injury during such incidents is very high.'' Why wouldn't we just keep driving if that happened? - What would you stop for? - [ Mandi ] What do you mean? [ Mikey ] I definitely would be in agreement with Colby on this one. - [ Bijou ] Yeah. Well, with that information. - In the middle of the road. If there's a kid in the road, he's getting it. - How about we cross that kid when we come to it? - [ Colby Laughs ] - [ Mikey ] Poor bastard. - [ Bijou ] Do you see any bodies? [ Mandi ] No. - Oh, shit. There's another one. - Shit. [ Mikey ] I'm digging it. I'm digging it. [ Bijou ] Would you call this a first world or a second world or a- [ Colby ] I call it the life expectancy drops 30 years if you move here. [ Bijou ] That guy was holding a gun. Well, here we are in not-so-beautiful Port Moresby. But, uh- [ Chuckles ] we're making the best of it. You know, hanging out, checking out the local sites. Check it out. [ Mikey ] Hey.

She wants to run into a village... and chop off their sacred chicken's head. - [ Bijou ] They're not sacred chicken. - So we can watch it run around. - Oh, they're not sacred? - Listen to him. Like he knows. - Basically, the chickens are sacred because- - Colby, we're not in India. - They're not sacred. - [ Mandi ] That's cows.

That is the last time we stop for anything. - Anything! - What, uh- You guys, whose bright idea? Stop? [ Mandi ] Yeah, so you'd have driven through, get shot at anyway? - No, no. - No. You drive through and don't get shot at. They shoot the people that stop. They shoot- - Can you not yell? Can you shut up? - No, I won't shut up. That was your two's idea. The bad idea came from you two. - Shut the fuck up. All right? - I'm not gonna shut the fuck up. - Shut up. - Hey, hey. This isn't fixing anything. - Quiet! - Throw your fucking ass out of this van. We just need to chill out, okay? This is where Michael Rockefeller was sighted in, I think, 1 988. There's been countless, you know, sightings. And this is just one of the villages where there's, like, four or five rumors. It's almost been confirmed that he was there. And so this is- this is our best bet. Here we go. [ Children Chattering ] If the kids like you, the parents have to like you. [ Speaking Foreign Language ] Rockefeller?

I- Bullshit. - I got a girlfriend. Her name's Melissa. - I don't- Can I tell you about my girlfriend? Her name's Melissa Christy Robinson. [ Chuckles ] What's your point? I'm saying it's, you know- Doesn't necessarily have to be Michael Rockefeller. It could be anyone. I say we shouldn't be culturally ignorant... and underestimate the intelligence of the natives. [ Mandi ] Yeah, but they didn't even speak English. I had to speak pidgin. Hello. Listen to the scholar back there. Underestimate people's intelligence. [ Mikey ] I say we go back and eat their ass. Eat 'em. Eat 'em. Huh, honey? I- I've got good loin, if you want to eat my loin. I have a good leg of loin. Loin. - Loin. Loin. - All right. - I could eat that. - [ Laughs ] [ Mikey ] You've gotJohn D. RockefellerJr.... the richest, most powerful man ofhis time. [ Colby ] Here he is, the richest man in the world.

[ Mikey ] Here we are, doing some night driving. Keep going, ladies. [ Bijou ] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

[ Sighs ] Let's get high. - Welcome to the jungle. - Let's go. - This is beautiful. - Let's go. [ Colby ] Welcome to the highlands. - [ Groans ] - Whoa. You all right? Yeah. - [ Bijou ] It's really mushy. - [ Colby ] It's kind of marshy. It's like quicksand. [ Bird Squawks ] [ Bijou ] It's really marshy. I think we have to go to, like, higher ground. - So, what do you think about this? - [ Colby ] Uh- Looks pretty good. Why don't we go back and go down the river, down the creek a little more? - [ Birds Chirping ] - [ Insects Buzzing ] - Careful. - Can you help me up there? Yeah. - [ Colby ] Hey. Who's got the rope? - [ Mikey ] Ah. I got some... here. Give me that pack. - Colby, turn the camera off. You're wasting the battery. - Chill. We've got the charger. Well, it's a little hard to charge a solar-powered battery in the dark. [ Bijou ] It's a little hard putting a tent up in the dark. And tomorrow we're not walking till it's dark. We need to get to the creek. G.P.S. says it's a quarter mile away. You want to take a bath and shave in the morning? All right. What do you guys want for dinner? - [ Colby ] New York strip, rare. - [ Mikey ] Oysters Rockefeller. No pun intended. - [ Bijou ] Sushi. - [ Mikey ] Colby, look at-Look at this. What is that?

So our group is gonna go across the valley highlands... and reach some tribes that have never really had any contact with white faces. Well, except for an Australian- crazy Australian who trades with them. Who's not doing us a service, by any means. Well,you know, maybe we can learn something from each other. If you'd like, we could- you could come to our camp. You ever thought about maybe, I don't know, going to a church? - I don't know. - Are you hitting on me? [ Chuckles ] Not- Not today. No. You better watch your wife, buddy. That's- Oh, I- I do. - We should hang out. - Absolutely. You want to come with us over there? - I was thinking you could stay in our tent. - Hmm? - Your tent. - You're a good-looking guy. Uh, call us when you've got it set up. - Yeah. - That'd be great. - Okay? - Okay. - [ Colby ] Okay, guys. Thank you. - Thanks. - All right. Well, I guess we're gonna take off... - but, please- - Good luck. If you need anything- - Anytime you want to hang out. - We're about a mile away. - [ Bijou ] Don't call us. We'll call you. - Good seeing you. [ Rich ] That's funny. Good luck with your documentary. - [ Bijou, Colby ] Yeah. - Thank you. We'll be looking forward to seeing that. God bless. - Cheers. - Bye. - Whoo! - Hey! Make a little toast. Looks like Mikey already drank a little bit. [ Mikey ] Pound it. Give it back to me then. - Me. - Ah, that's good. [ Colby ] So, the first night. Uh, we had quite the trials and tribulations getting here. Had shots fired. Fire in the hole. - Shots fired. - Uh, we logged about 1 5 miles today. Feeling good. Get up bright and early tomorrow. [ Clicks Tongue ] And we're on the move again. - Not too early. - Hey. Pass that here, Mikey. Let's take it easy tomorrow. Seriously, let's take it easy tomorrow. - I'm not up for a full day. - Hey, we're just getting into a groove here. Yeah, I know. I know. But- [ Sighs ] [ Mikey ] We're not taking into account the hangover factor. Which I definitely think is pretty crucial. Guys, we're not having a big night. We're gonna have a few drinks. Then we're gonna go to bed, and we're gonna get up and move and do it all over again. [ Mikey ] Speak for yourself, buddy. [ Chuckles ] All right. I'm here repping the Cannibal Crusaders. Here to take- make- take a toast- or make a toast- doesn't really matter- to another fun evening. [ Colby ] All right, guys. Last night was fun. But, uh, we're going to bed. Don't stay up too late, okay? 6.:00 a.m. - Yeah. We'll catch you. - [ Bijou ] Bright and bushy-tailed. - We'll catch you at 6:00, bro. - [ Bijou Chuckles ] [ Colby ] Hey. The G.P.S. says we've got 1 2 miles to Rockefeller's river. The Takreet. We should be there by nightfall. [ Bijou ] I'm pretty sure I shouldn't be doing this, but- [ Chuckles ] I'm pretty certain my liver can handle it after all the, uh-[ Chuckles ] abuse I've administered to it over the years. - [ Birds Chirping ] - [ Insects Buzzing ] Oh, fuck! [ Mikey ] OhI [ Chuckling ] - Oh. - [ Groaning ] - Ouch. - [ Groans ] Goddamn it. - Let's see it. Let's see it. - [ Mandi Gasps ] Ouch! Yeah. We finally made it to the Takreet River. - And we survived the highlands. - We did. But will we survive them? [ Mikey ] We got it. Yeah! [ Mandi ] God, no. The Fuck You Gorilla Squad has got us here. - And we will hide from the cannibals. - Will it cure my ails? - [ Colby ] Unbelievable. - [ Mikey ] Hide from the cannibals. - Ooh! - [ Colby ] GeezI - [ Mandi ] Oh, God. - Cannibals! All right. So here's the deal. We're going on six hours of drinking straight up. [ Chuckles ] And I got this creepy little hand going under my shirt. [ Chuckles ] - [ Raspberry ] - Oh, yeah! Gi- Gi- Give me that again. [ Colby ] Okay, guys. The last two nights were great, but, uh- - Hey, Daddy-O. - We're getting up at 6:00 tomorrow. - [ Chuckles ] - So don't stay up too late, okay? - A.m. or p.m.? - Rock and roll, Colby. - See, the plan is to drink- - A.m. or p.m.? [ Mandi ] A.m., Bijou. You heard it. to drink and stay up until they get up. This is bullshit! I'm waking them up. I don't care. Mikey! Bijou! Get the fuck out of that tent. We were supposed to leave three hours ago. Get up. Sunrise was the plan. Am I wrong? Sunrise. Three hours ago. You guys on fucking vacation? We're not on vacation. We have a plan, and we need to stick to it. - Go get some more sleep. - Can't do this every morning. I don't know what you guys are here for. It was my idea. All right. just let me have a smoke. What did you just say to me? Searching for Michael Rockefeller. It was my idea. - Am I wrong? - Is that right? You are fucking wrong. - Hmm? - Yeah. We're gonna fuckin' take this up later. [ Bijou ] What do you reckon? Do you think it's in good shape? [ Mikey ] Ah, this one's kind of old and brown, but... that's like the fourth one we've seen, and you know the natives are using this for transport. - I can make this shit in, like, 30 minutes. - Straight up? Bamboo? - Yeah. - There's heaps up there. - What? - Let's go. Fuck off. I'm looking at the bamboo raft... we should be making now and floating down the river instead of walking. Mikey, we are not building a raft. Do you guys know anything about the Takreet River? - Let's hear it, buddy. - Oh, you- I see you did your research. That's good. You know about the crocodiles and the whirlpools... and the waterfalls that are around every corner. But they're uncharted, so you don't know when they're gonna come. That's the best part. We are not building a raft. End of story. Let's fucking go. You could start with the bamboo stick that's up his ass. [ Bijou ] just be cool. Okay. Hey, guys. Um, let's just be adults about this, you know? We all have to get along, or we're just- we're not gonna make it. All right? Is that cool? Really. All right? Okay. Let's move. Fuck him. I'm beating his ass. - [ Bijou ] All right, babe? - [ Mandi ] Yeah. Got it. Okay. [ Branch Snaps ] Here. [ Bijou ] Cool. Cool. Oh. Shit. Well, it's become apparent that they have the personality of root vegetables. - Um- - [ Mikey ] They're squares. just-Just take a look over here. - Come on! - Let's go! - Look at these guys. - See, kids? This is what happens when you say no to booze and good times. Colby is on the verge of getting his ass beat. - I love beating rich boy ass. - What are you doing? Your girlfriend over there wants to roll a cigarette every five seconds. She's eating our food. We're late. We're five days behind schedule because of them. - They wake up late. - [ Mandi ] She's not my girlfriend. - It's Mikey instigating it anyway. Fix it with Mikey. - Why did you bring her? It's like I feel I constantly have to justify myself to you... It's like I feel I constantly have to justify myself to you... because you're always ragging on me about smoking or drinking or... just being loose. And it's, like, it doesn't matter. It's, like, we are the way we are. Why should we justify it? Why should I justify it? You don't think of alcohol as a- a crutch? Um, perhaps. But why is that a bad thing? I mean, some people use money as a crutch. Some people use love as a crutch. Shopping. Fishing. Golfing. - But it's a crutch. - And what's wrong with that? Why is that a bad thing? We all need something to get through fuckin' life. To stop, you know- [ Chuckles ] Okay. To get our asses out of bed in the morning. Well,yours actually doesn't get out ofbed in the morning. So sue me. [ Chuckles ] [ Colby ] Not everyone needs the bottle to be happy. I drink to make you guys interesting. [ Chuckles ] Wow. And I'm gonna smoke to that. - [ Colby ] Mikey loves it. - Yeah. Loves this girl over here talkin'shit. [ Chuckles ] He'll back me up. I'm tired of your happy day bullshit routine all the time. I know you're bitching about me. You're bitching about me constantly. - I can hear you in the tent. - [ Mandi ] What are you talking about? - [ Colby ] BijouI - [ Mikey ] It's not our business. Fuckin'stay out of it. Stay out of it. It's not your business. - [ Mandi ] You need to stop fucking drinking then. - Shut the fuck up. - Oh, fuck off. I'm tired of your bullshit. - No. We drag your ass all over this- this tropical village here. Hey. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him. Hey. - For him? What did he do? - He's the one who- - I did everything. - Oh, we're gonna sit on that ''it was his idea'' thing. All you've done is insult us and put us down the whole time. - No. We're here 'cause of me. - Acting like sergeant major, thinking you're all tough. - Bring it. Bring the confrontation. - Let's go. We're moving on. - We're moving on? - Get out of my face. - Get out of my face. - You think this is a joke? - [ Bijou ] Fuck you, man. - Mandi. Mandi, let's go. - Careful, man. Be chill. - [ Mandi ] Bijou. - Let's go. - You shut the fuck up. - Cut outI - Oh, fuck off. [ Bijou ] Hello? Hello? Since when did you turn 60? Here. Drink some of this. Guys. Drink. Merry. Enjoy.

Coming straight at you. - Bitch! -Jesus fucking Christ, Mikey. Who's got balls now, huh? [ Colby ] How do you guys have the energy for this? - Oh, forgot. You were eating our food. - [ Mandi ] Fucking disgusting. - Like that? - Spit on my face. [ Colby ] Bijou, there's a couple poisonous plants over there you could eat. [ Mandi ] Yeah. Eat those. Eat the poisonous ones. - They're fucking not as poison as your mouth. - Here is what you can eat. - Is my shit. - Funny. Know what she is? She's your little sperm rag. Aren't ya? - Bijou, what'd I tell you about that shit? - Get over yourself, darling. - Yeah. - What? What are you showing me? Your crooked teeth? - [ Colby ] You've got something in your teeth. - Yeah. - Why don't you say what's on your mind? Why are you full of shit? - She doesn't have a mind. - Ha, ha, ha, ha. - So, the Fuck You Gorilla Squad will retire into the woods. - [ Bijou ] ColbyI WowI Oh, my GodI It's so goodI - [ Mandi ] Oh, God. [ Moaning ] - Do you like my jungle song, Mandi? - [ Screaming ] Do you like it? Do you like it? That's what you sound like. That's what you fucking sound like. At least we haven't been hit with the ugly stick. That's for sure. - [ Colby ] The ugly stick. - Right here, baby. This is beautiful. This is beautiful. - I am Colby. I am so beautiful. - Bend over. Bend over. - Bijou, get off me! - Bend over. Bend over. - Get off me! Fucking stupid- - I'm Colby. - I'm Colby. -Jesus Christ! [ Burps ] - Yeah. Let's go on vacation and get hammered. - Yeah. Huh?

We can eat their chickens. - We can eat their chickens. - Yeah, we can eat their chickens! - Yeah! And we'll roll cigarettes and smoke with the locals. - Yeah. Exactly. Yeah! And then- Oh! And then we can slaughter their cow. - Yeah. Good idea. - And eat that. - Huh? - Colby, you dropped your wiener. [ Mikey Laughs ] [ Burps ] What? [ Mandi ] Colby. - You all right? - This is fucked-up. [ Mikey ] These are my kind of people. [ Mandi ] Mikey, what are you doing? Don't get too close, man. This is absolutely gorgeous. I've never seen anything... so beautiful. It's like in death there's this togetherness. - Like in death they re-create life. - [ Mandi ] Mikey. - [ Colby ] Don't fuck with it. - [ Mikey ] Let me just touch this. - [ Colby ] NoI - [ Mandi ] Mikey. Stop.Just. Mikey- We could make a lot of money off these, honey. What do you think? Hey. I'm Colby. I think I run this outfit. - [ Bijou ] How are ya? - [ Man ] What might you be doing here in New Guinea? - [ Bijou ] You're an Aussie. - Yeah, mate. - So am I. - Yeah? What are you doing up here? - Oh,you know,just, uh, hanging out. - Yeah? - [ Mikey ] Yep. - How about you, mate? Where are you from? - U.S. - Fucking Americans. You're not the ones who've been up here fucking around with these grave sites, are youse? - Maybe. - [ Bijou ] No, mate. No. We're not into that kind ofbullshit. Look, mate. I've known these people for years. I've lived here for bloody- a long time. If they fuckin' catch you up there fucking around, they'll kill ya. - They're not gonna kill shit. - Well, mate, I'm telling you. If they fucking catch you, they'll kill you. They don't fuckin' muck around here. If that's been you up there fucking around, I'd fuck off out of here right now. 'Cause if they catch you, I'm telling you, you're dead meat. - [ Bijou ] All right, mate. - [ Mikey ] Yeah. - [ Man ] They'll fucking have you. - Sweet. - [ Bijou ] Listen. Take care. - Yeah. I'll take care. - [ Colby ] Give me the skull! - [ Mikey Whooping ] - Happy campers, the natives are getting restless. - Give me the fucking skull! - [ Mandi ] Give me the skull! - That's my skull. - Bijou, you guys are clinically- Stop this! - Give me the fucking skull. - That's my skull, baby. - Mikey, come here! - That's my skull. - Watch the booze. Watch the booze. - I thought we were friends. - Sacred burial ground. That's real good. Let's take a fucking skull. - Look at you guys. - Take a fucking skull. - Give me the skull! - Give it to me! - [ Bijou ] It's a score. - First thing tomorrow we're putting it back! - TouchdownI - We can't put it back.

[ Laughing ] - [ Laughing ] - Yeah, man! - Au revoir. See you later. - Whoo-hoo! - [ Colby ] Come back! We'll meet you. We'll meet you up, buddy. - You're so cute when you're angry. - We'll meet you up. You're lucky I didn't beat your ass on the way out. - We'll send you a Christmas card. - Stay there, bro. [ Mikey ] We love you. We'll catch you. How easy does it feel without them now? Like- There's this huge weight off my shoulders. It's as if- - [ Mikey ] The real question is, uh- - You shouldn't have- - Whoa. [ Chuckles ] - Yeah? I don't think you should have shared this whole thing with Colby. I think we should have just gone and done it ourselves. You know, I don't think they wanted to catch us, to tell you the truth. I honestly- I think we did them a favor... because there would have been some ass beating... with another day of- of- of conflict. - Well, we actually solved a problem, plain and simple. - Yeah. - Like, we made everyone happy. - I think so. And, I mean, personally, they can rot in hell... - and we can make millions of dollars. - Maybe. Off Michael Rockefeller. And, um, a few pilfered skulls. - With a good sale on eBay. - [ Chuckles ] Yeah, that was pretty lame. Yeah. That was tight. And worst-case scenario, I mean, we got to kick it... in Irian Jaya. [ Sighs ] A guy fired an AK-47 in my face. That's my idea of a good time. I don't think I could, uh- I could ask for a better vacation. You know,you should put those glasses back on. They make you look semi-halfway decent cute. [ Chuckles ] Keep talkin' smack. Keep talkin' smack. - 'Cause I'd do the same for you. - [ Chuckles ] You take your glasses. I don't need 'em. - You're too tough for accessories. - Too tough. You know. [ Mikey ] There it is, baby. Shake it. You're a rock star. Put Colby's camera to use here. Turn around a little. A little bit. - Turn around. - Check it out. Check it out! - Check what out? - Look! - Look at what? - Shh. Shh. Shh. [ Mikey ] There's nothing over here. You're always seeing shit anyway. - It's all the drugs you did last night. - Mikey,just look. I think there's something up there. just look. I don't have time for this, Bijou. If you want to fuck around, take the camera. - Give me the camera. Shut up. - Take the camera. Have fun. I'm gonna get us ready because we have stuff to do. Mikey, I think there's something up there. - Mikey. - Bijou, we don't have time. - I need you here. Can you come here, please? - No, I'm not coming over there. - Babe. Mikey. - You're on drugs. You are on drugs. Get the fuck on the raft. - I think we're being followed. Can you just come here? - Get the fuck on the raft. - MikeyI - Don't throw shit at me! Get on the fucking raft! Get over here. Get over here. How do I know you're not gonna leave me out here? 'Cause I would have left you with Colby and Mandi if I wanted to. Maybe that was phase one of your plan. Maybe there's phase two. - Oh, really? - Maybe there's ''use me to help you get down the river''... and, um- I mean, you got your raft. You've got your gun. [ Bijou ] I thought it was pretty lame how you, uh, took that skull the other day. [ Bijou ] I thought it was pretty lame how you, uh, took that skull the other day. I didn't want to say it in front of the other kids, but- I don't know who you were trying to impress, but- I can deal with your mouth, and I can deal with your aggression... but I just can't deal with your ignorance. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - See that? - Are you seeing that? See that? - [ Bijou ] Holy shit. - What is that? - Mikey. - Get over here. [ Bijou ] I fucking told you. This is what I was telling you by that riverbank. You're such a macho aggressive fuck sometimes. [ Mikey ] What's the fucking difference? What's this guy got, a bow and arrow? I got a pistol. just stay-stay close to the edge. [ Bijou ] I am. I am. jesus, Mikey. I can't deal with being followed, being watched. Are they aggressive? [ Mikey ] I don't know, man. Stay down. I don't know. You need to be cool. Fucking don't come to me with that shit right now. [ Bijou ] Is there, like, a peace offering we can give them? - What are you talking about? - I don't know. Are some of them friendly? Are some of them nasty? They can't all be fucking wack. [ Mikey ] We just left Colby and Mandi because they were being like this.Just stay chill. Look at them. They're not even- - [ Bijou ] There's more. - They're just the people that live here. It's not a big deal. [ Bijou ] They're armed, Mikey. They're armed. [ Mikey ] Yeah. 'Cause they're probably hunting for food. If anybody's gonna get killed, it's gonna be Colby and Mandi. [ Bijou ] If they didn't like us, they would have fired by now, right? - Mikey, right? - Yeah. Don't be an idiot. just put the gun away. Bijou, if you say another fucking word, I swear to God... I'll throw you off the raft so they can eat your ass. Fucking do somethingI Fire an arrow. I- I'm gonna kill you. Look at these guys. I swear to God, if they keep following us, I'm gonna fuckin'shoot 'em. Mikey, they're just being protective, okay? just put the gun down. We're in their- We're in their waters, okay? Well, sometimes you can just, you know, get a little bit over the edge sometimes. And I- I don't even know how to pull you back. If you say one more thing about the gun, Bijou, it's over. Do you understand? It's over. [ Bijou ] If we still have that skull, I think we should put it back. All right. That's a- That's an intelligent idea. - Why don't we just go up the river- - I think it's a smart idea. - Yeah. I'm- - I think we should restore what is theirs. I don't think we should- [ Insects Buzzing ] [ Thunder Rumbles ] [ Bijou ] So let's dump these coconuts,yeah? - Yeah. - Hey. Are there coconuts in pina coladas? - [ Chuckles ] - Is that coconut, or is that daiquiri? I'm down for it, but I think we need to get some meat first. - I'm frickin'tired of eatin'- - Yeah. I got fish. I spearfish. - Make a coconut- - Bijou, stop. Stop, Bijou. - What? - Move towards me now. Move towards me now. - Go. Go. The camera. - [ Gun Cocks ] - Go. Get behind me now. Move. - Okay. Go, Bijou. Up towards the- Go. To the river. Mikey, don't look in his eyes. Don't look in his eyes. [ Mikey ] Just don't look at him, and keep moving. Now. - [ Bijou ] Hold my hand.
