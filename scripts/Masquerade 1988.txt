Guys, come on, bring it in! - Get the jib! - Cannonball is outpointing us. Trim it! Trimming the jib sheet for speed now! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Drive! I need more helm. Traveler up. Okay, guys. Hold the boom! Hold it down! - Get it up! - Watch the boom! Duck! We got them. I think we got them. Come on. Come on. Hit it! Go! Hit it! Drive! Check it out! Shit! Be at Four Winds at 6:30. - Mr. Morrison... - I won't spend money to lose! It takes a long time to get a boat right. She kicked ass to windward. Yeah, she did that. She'll be awesome when we get her tuned. If I'm not in the poorhouse! Hi, Jillian. This is Tim Whalen. Jillian Wilde. - Hi. - I'm out of here. Obsession is spending the summer in the yard. Tim's gonna stay with her. Anybody have a chauffeur's cottage or garage apartment available? I'll ask around. Got to keep my captain happy. This is the first summer I've looked forward to in years. He really trusts me. Who? Your husband. C.G. Thank God. It's not that painful, is it? No, that's the problem. It feels too good to stop. We could always give it a try. Maybe we should stop... this. Or maybe this. Wait, wait, wait. What? You want your birthday present, don't you? You remembered. That's more than my husband did. You want me to put these on? I can't bite them off if you don't. Olivia Lawrence. Marjorie Little. Kathleen Monahan. I love you, Dad. Liv! Mike. How are you? Get in. What's this? - I'm a cop. - Yeah, I can see that. I thought you were gonna study law. I did. I worked my little buns off, took the state police forensics course, and now I am the law. - When did you get in? - Last night. You seen anybody? No. I've been in the house all day. I'm sorry about your mom. Thanks. Headquarters to 209. That's me. Respond to Le French Crepe, Main and Hampton. Theft of service. 10-4? 10-4. It's a ditch and dine. I gotta roll. First major crime wave of the summer. - Okay. - Okay. Lawrence dropped them off. Two minutes later... boom! Six people are dead. Harbormaster said they never knew what hit them. Your old man's a real barrel of laughs. Two or three propane explosions each year Not much sense getting killed because of a $5 piece of flexihose. Why don't we take a look right now? Thanks, Sam. If he needs it, use it. I heard Obsession is gonna be in most of the summer. Morrison's doing about 200 thous' worth of work. Jesus! If I wasn't doing it, I'd swear his hot-shit captain was in for a taste. He told me to take my time, only use the best. Maybe he just wants a summer in the Hamptons. I gotta go. Did you ever meet him on the Southern Circuit? - Who's that? - Tim Whalen, Morrison's captain. I heard of him. I never met him. It's funny. I know I've seen him somewhere. You coming to dinner this week? - How's Wednesday? - I'll tell your mother. I'll see you later, Pop. How you doing? - Hey, Tommy. - Captain. I got some parts for you to look at. May I please see your invitation, sir? It's all right, Mike. He's with me. Nice to see you, Mrs. Morrison. I didn't see your name on the invitation list. I'm crashing. - You look incredible. - Thank you. - Have one on me, okay? - Okay. I understand youre teaching at the club. I just started. Well, my two little granddaughters already have mad crushes on you. There's someone I want you to meet. The Lawrence girl. Terrible about her mother, huh? Olivia Lawrence, Tim Whalen. Of course you know Brooke Morrison. Hello, Mrs. Morrison. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. Well, Tim, dance with this young lady while Brooke and I gossip. - Mrs. Chase... - It'll be good for you. Come along, Brooke, darling. Would you like to dance? Who is the guy you were dancing with... boyfriend? No. Good. 209. Headquarters to 209. Resume normal patrol until 0100. 10-4? 10-4. I'll be in in 10 minutes. Put some coffee on for me, all right, Bernadette? 10-4. You ever been to the Hamptons before? No. Mr. Morrison's had Obsession down south since I've been on it. Me, too... You ever meet a man named Gateworth on the Southern Circuit? Yeah. He's a real jerk. He's here tonight over at the bar. He's my mother's last husband. I guess I put my foot in my mouth, huh? I should have worn my mint-flavored shoes. We got into a beef in Bermuda. He rammed me coming into the harbor. He shouldn't be allowed to tail a jib sheet. You sail. Since before I could walk. Would you like to go out sometime... on the water? Are you a member at the club? You should come down. I'm there every day. I guess... time to go. How about Wednesday? Wednesday's great. 2:00? Okay. Hi. Looks like you two got along. Yeah, she's a nice kid. She's about the richest nice kid on the east coast. Really? The only thing money's good for is to make a boat go faster. Hi, Tony. When did you get here? - That Tony Gateworth. - Steady, Tony. He's drunk again. He's never sober. Well, well, well. Please don't embarrass both of us. I'm not the one climbing all over boat niggers. When did you start chasing after white trash? I don't. Milady. Save your breath, Olivia. I don't care what the offer is, the answer is no. All I'm asking is that you talk to Theodore Cantrell and see if you can work something out. You think I'm going to give up Aspen or Hobe Sound or summers here? Forget it. Anyway, my dear, you know your mother wanted me here with you. You fooled her. You never fooled me. Hi. Anne Briscoe. You must be Tony's stepdaughter. Yeah. Olivia Lawrence. Darling, could you send somebody down to the cleaners to get my dress? Alberto will be happy to do it. What is the princess's problem? A little bitch. Not only is Gateworth living off my money, but he's trying to run my life. Unfortunately, my dear, this office drew up the will. Short of his remarrying, there's no way to keep Mr. Gateworth out of any of the residences. Maybe I should just buy a house. You already own eight, Olivia. They're not mine as long as he can come and go as he pleases. Key money? How much income does he get from Mummy's estate? 228,000 last quarter. If you were to marry, your husband would be in the same situation once you had a baby. The child would inherit your estate. Your husband would be generously provided for during his lifetime. Gateworth is getting a million a year. He's not going to need key money. Apparently, it's not enough. He's usually in trouble six weeks into the quarter. How could he be? You lose $112,000 in 3 days in Atlantic City, you can probably use extra cash. Would it be legal? Could he ever get back in? Not if he signed a quitclaim against his right of occupancy. Let's try it. I'll see what I can do. You realize, though, if he says no, there's nothing we can do. - Boy, you really like that movie, huh? - I love that movie. It's been ages since I've been to the movies. I feel like I'm 16 again. Those were fun summers. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Maybe I'll... Graduate school, maybe travel for a while... Try and figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life. Do you remember when we were 12? The summer I taught you how to sail. Summer before that. What you told your mom. That we were gonna get married when we grew up. I guess some dreams don't die. It's the wrong dream, Mike. Youre right. You little creeps, get out of here. I'll see you on Friday. - Bye, Tim. - That was great! That was boring. - I didn't think youd come. - I didn't think I was going to. Well, youre right on time to the second. It's a little problem I have... compulsive promptness. I thought maybe we could take my boat out. - Great. - Okay. She's beautiful. She's no Obsession. But she was Daddy's pride and joy. When did he die? When I was 12. Mrs. Morrison says that your mother died recently. Yeah. A couple of months ago. Both my parents were killed in a plane crash eight years ago. We should be getting back. You want to take her? Okay. Ready about? Hard alee! Want to grab a beer? We can get one at my house. - Where do you live? - Dune Road. Longview Cottage. Cute cottage. My grandparents built it in28. They had a house in Bar Harbor, but Gramps got fed up with spending most of the summers alone. Shit! - Who's that? - Gateworth's girlfriend. Anne Briscoe, Tim Whalen. - Hi. - How do you do? I'm doing fine. Nice to meet you. Just can't stay away from the help, Olivia? I don't want to listen to this, Tony. Then you listen, Romeo. Keep sniffing around my stepdaughter, youre gonna be out of a job. I am talking to Cantrell in the morning. You can talk to your heart's content. Youre not getting me out of here. I think I should be getting back to the club. Good idea. Get back and hump Brooke Morrison. Tony! I'm sorry about that. Don't worry about it. Would you like to have dinner sometime? Go out? Well, I'm not much of a cook. Sure. I'd love to. - Friday? - Okay. - About that thing Gateworth said... - That's none of my business. I spend a lot of time with Mr. And Mrs. Morrison. All I know is she's really in love with her husband. How long had you been on Morningstar? Three years. Skipper for the last two. It was a good boat, but I just couldn't win with her. When Mr. Morrison offered me Obsession. I jumped at the chance. Thanks. You were awfully young to be on the helm, weren't you? I was the youngest captain on the Southern Ocean Racing Circuit. You race? I've beaten every guy my age in Solings from Montauk to City Island. Any ocean racing? Nobody would ever give me a shot Youd be too much of a distraction. All I really wanted to do was sail. I barely lasted two semesters at college. The day classes ended, I ferried a one-ton from Santa Barbara to Palm Beach. Daddy would have really liked you. She changed husbands around as often as she changed cars. She had three in eight years, but Gateworth, he was by far the worst. - What was she looking for? - I don't know. I think she wanted someone to love her for her. That was a really good movie. Why are we whispering? I don't know. It sort of feels like we ought to. Good night. Your mother made it quite clear that I was to keep an eye on you. What I'm seeing would make her spin in her grave. From the Virgin Mary to Mary Magdalene in under a month. - I don't want to talk about it. - I don't want to, either. I just want you to stop seeing him. You'll embarrass me, youll embarrass the family. All right, I'll embarrass the family. You've been an embarrassment ever since you conned my mother into marrying you. Don't you ever touch me! I'm going away for the weekend. When I get back, I want the boat nigger out of your life! I hate him. I really hate him. Look on the bright side. At least we'll get to spend the weekend together. Oh, at my house. I'll give the staff the weekend off. God, I want to kiss you. I've been warned against public displays of affection on club property. Lobster roll! Pick up! Lobster roll! - Everything okay over here? - It's very good. Two lobster rolls and a chicken-fried steak. Sorry I'm late. What do you know about him? He's from California. Both his parents are dead. He has a married sister in San Francisco. He loves sailing as much as I do. He's the first man I've ever been comfortable with. We have too much money. You know that. He doesn't care about that. If he really doesn't care, grab him. Ones like that are as rare as your father. The important thing is to establish a psychological dominance. Once she sees you can handle me, she's gonna be totally dependent on you. Just be careful when youre waving that damn gun around. I am not about to hurt the guy who is going to lay the golden egg. Come on. Cheer up. A year from now, the late Olivia Lawrence-Whalen's grieving husband and stepfather will both be on the Forbes 400. I have a better idea. Well, I'd just love to hear it. There's so much money, maybe we'd be better off with her around. Forget it. Look, I think the heat will be too much. Think? You don't think. I think. You perform. The only way this deal goes south is if you fuck it up. You want out? Fine. Youre on the first bus back to Palookaville, and I find myself another $2 gigolo. You think it's that easy? You think she'll just fall for whoever you drag in? She fell for you, didn't she? We can get everything we want, maybe more, by keeping her healthy. I'll make it real simple. Youre either in now, or youre out. You even think of fucking with me, she's gonna know your whole life story... the real one. You got that? Yeah, I got it. That's better... partner. More coffee? - What was that? - What's wrong? I heard something. You fucking little whore! Bringing this garbage into your mother's house? That's enough! - Shut the fuck up. - Give me the gun! I told you to stay away from her, you little prick. Calm down. Nobody wants... - Maybe I'll just blow your... - For God's sakes, Tony! You fu... Is he... Call the police. Oh, my God. Do you realize how this is going to look? They're gonna think we planned this. Yeah. Youve got to go. You go. I'll call the police. What will you say? I don't know. I'll say... I'll say that I was here alone, and he came in, and I thought he was a burglar. You just happened to have a gun. That's Tony's gun, so I'll say that I got it out of his night table this afternoon. - There was nobody in the house. - It won't work! It will work! It was fired point blank. They can tell things like that. Then I'll say that he came in and he tried to rape me. There's no way anybody can prove that I didn't do it! - Yes, there is! - How? Guns leave a powder on your hand. They can tell you hadn't fired one. Let's just call the police and tell the truth. Now you have to go. There's... no way they'll believe us if we both have... ...powder on our hand. Oh, God. I'm gonna be sick! I love you. I love you. Hi. Youre awfully late. I had to stay late, settle them down. I even had to promise Abrams he could get off of the foredeck as soon as Obsession is ready. We don't get many nights together, you know. I know. What can I do to make it up to you? Taking off your clothes would be a good start. Affirmative, 17. 187 at Longview Cottage. And he fell after you kicked him. - I grabbed the gun... - Gateworth's gun. I got it from his room this afternoon. Worried about the burglaries in the neighborhood. The staff had the weekend off, so I... Oh, God! You okay? Yeah. Is he gone? He's gone. It was just an accident. It was... What about the second shot? It just went off. My hand jerked. Okay. It's okay. I told you, I just have to ask. He tells you he'd be gone for a week, he comes back in the middle of the night, drunk, tries to attack you. - You were terrified? - Yes. It's gonna have to go by the D.A., but this is gonna be justifiable homicide. Is there anyplace you wanna go, anybody you wanna call? Yeah. I'd like to go over to Holly's, please. You listen to me. I don't want you to say anything to anyone except your attorney, okay? You know what the press is like. They'll be all over you. I just don't want you to have any problem with this, okay? 'Cause Gateworth sure wasn't worth it. Thanks, Mike. Come on. Joe, will you please take Miss Lawrence over to Holly Morgan's residence? Have the detectives been here yet? Yeah. That's right. Get that as well. - Did that show anything? - Nothing. The wall's clear, right? Okay. Check this out. I think we have everything. Theodore Cantrell. I'm Miss Lawrence's attorney. You were the investigating officer? Yes, sir. This is my chief, Ed Wells. Lieutenant Wacker, Suffolk County Police, homicide. - Why wasn't Miss Lawrence arrested? - On the weapons charge? It was my decision not to arrest based on the fact that the victim held a license for the weapon. We had a meeting with the district attorney this morning. Unless new evidence is forthcoming, we don't anticipate the filing of any charges. I'm going upstairs. - Lieutenant. - I'll be outside. Thank you. County police are letting us work this one alone. I've known the Lawrence family my whole life. My father helped build this house. Mr. Cantrell, the D.A. Doesn't want to see Olivia Lawrence's picture plastered all over the National Enquirer. And neither do I. Know what I mean? I was so scared. If the D.A. Goes along with this, we're home free. He lay there for hours. If anything goes wrong, I'm coming forward. That would be the worst thing you could do. It was self-defense. Either they'd think we were in it together or you were lying. This is gonna ruin everything, isn't it? It was an accident. The only way it's gonna affect us is if we let it. Yeah. I'm sorry. A man has been murdered, and youre not doing anything about it! There's not one scintilla of evidence implicating Miss Lawrence. That is the most insane... For Chrissake, she shot him! Look, Tony, he was no saint, but he... This isn't right. It's just not right. Unfortunately, youre simply not in possession of all the facts. Maybe youd just better fill me in on all the facts before I go to the state attorney general! Did you know that Mr. Gateworth was going to return to the Hamptons this weekend? No. He wasn't supposed to be back until Tuesday. Were you aware that he'd made advances toward Miss Lawrence in the past? That's a ridic... What, did she tell you that? No, ma'am. Two members of the staff observed incidents on separate occasions. I don't believe it. We do. On the night that he died, Mr. Gateworth returned home in the middle of the night, entered his stepdaughter's bedroom, and attempted to rape her. She defended herself. He had a blood-alcohol level of.15. He was quite drunk. It doesn't make sense. He hated her. Rape's a crime of violence, ma'am, not affection. It's hot in here. Mr. Gateworth's death was regrettable, but he wasn't murdered. What about the boyfriend? What boyfriend? Her boyfriend. What, you don't know about him? It figures. A professional sailor. Tony despised him. What's his name? I don't know. I only met him once! But I'd sure as hell talk to him! Know anything about a boyfriend? No, sir. I'll check it out. Jesus! Just what I needed. There wasn't anything to indicate someone else had been in the house, was there? No, sir. Alberto! Alberto? Hi, Mike. Social call? I wish it was. You have a new boyfriend. I shouldn't be telling you this. Gateworth's girlfriend is making all kinds of noise, says he hated the guy youve been going out with. Is there anything else you want to tell me about the other night? I told you exactly what happened. I don't think you told me everything. I asked around. Youve been seeing a guy named Tim Whalen. He has nothing to do with this. You two had dinner that night at the Colombe d'Or? - So? - It was a late dinner. You didn't leave the restaurant till after 10:00. We got here by 10:30. Tim left by 11:30. I know you couldn't kill anyone. Youre good. I'll give you that. Youre really good. You had me fooled. It wasn't like that. Look, it's no contest. I'm married, and she's got $200 million. - You hit the jackpot. - Come on. You know how much I care about money, for Chrissake. I wouldn't believe you if you told me water was wet. You stay away from me, all right? One more thing. I was out with Olivia the night Gateworth was killed. The police may want to verify my whereabouts around midnight. - Are you crazy? - Just tell them the truth... that I was with you at your place from 11:30 on. Do you have any idea what's gonna happen if this gets out? Like I said, if it comes up, tell the truth. That's all I'm gonna tell them. There's no reason for me to get into that other stuff you told me, get perfectly innocent guys involved. You prick. - Brooke Morrison? - Whalen didn't want to name her until I convinced him that I thought he killed Gateworth. And? She confirmed it... spent the night with him from 11:30 on. You believe her? She would have loved to cause him problems. - He dumped her for the girl. - That's that. Except for Anne Briscoe. I told Mrs. Morrison I'd do everything I could to keep her name out of it. Shouldn't be a problem. If Briscoe keeps her mouth shut. She keeps talking, we're gonna have to show her how we know he's not involved. I'll tell her the case is closed. I don't know if that will do it. Suppose he did do it. Suppose Gateworth was killed an hour earlier. What are you trying to say... he walked in on them? Yeah. Maybe, yeah. He and Gateworth got into some kind of beef. You got any way of proving this? Not yet. Then I don't want to hear about it. You grew up here, for Chrissake! I have to draw you a picture? No, sir. All right. He's absolutely perfect. Aside from the fact that he's gorgeous Aside from the fact that he's gorgeous and that he's charmed the pants off the family, he's obviously crazy about you, and that's the only thing that really matters. I love him. No kidding. Thanks, Uncle Charlie. You throw a great wedding. Thanks for coming. - Thanks for inviting me. - Nice to meet you. - I'll get the car. - Okay. - Your friend Tim made quite a hit. - I knew he would. You won't mind if I make a suggestion? Why? What kind? Let me run a check on him. I need him a lot more than he needs me. - Thanks. - Bye-bye. So what's the Deering story? Nina was two years ahead of me in school, and... ...Lex is a stuffed shirt. He's the type who'll meet somebody, and then he'll go home and check and see if they're in the social register. - She seemed nice. - She is. - They had to get married. - Nobody has to get married today. Catholics do. All three of the Kaiser girls were shotgun. Daddy's right. - About what? - Champagne. What'd he say? "Makes girls dance and drop their pants." Milk? Sugar? No. Maybe a little something stronger? No, thank you. Look, Miss Briscoe, there's no one who'd rather pin Gateworth's murder on Whalen than me... ...but I can't do a thing without proof. Give me a break. Nobody in this town is gonna rock that little bitch's boat. That's not true of me. Oh, yeah? Yeah, well, I've got something, but I'm going to the papers. Let's see how she feels about that. I really hope you don't do that. If you do have proof, going to the media will just prejudice a criminal prosecution. I know everybody in this town. I know the summer people, the winter people, poor people. So? One of my poor friends was in Carlson's Diner the day that Tony died. Tony walked in, sat with some young kid, and they had an argument. Did your friend recognize this kid? No. He never saw him before, but he'd recognize him if he saw him again. It was that sailor. I know it was him. So either you do something... ...or I'm going to. What's your friend's name? You get that Keystone Kop police chief to reopen this investigation... ...I'll bring my friend in. - Marry me! - What did you say? You heard me. - Olivia. - A simple "yes" would be fine. You know I love you. Jesus! Forget it. Pretend I never said it. I didn't mean it. No, there's nothing in the world I'd rather do than marry you. I just don't think you know enough about me. You rob banks or something? - Bounce checks. - For a living? When I quit school, I got caught in Cincinnati with no money. I wrote a lot of checks on a closed account, spent 30 days in jail. And for that, you won't marry me. - There's something else. - What? Gateworth was right about one thing... I did have an affair with Brooke Morrison. When did it stop? The day I met you. Olivia, look at me. I have nothing. I have three pairs of Top-Siders, some foul-weather gear. I don't even have a credit card. - Do you love me? - Yes, I love you. I just don't think we should get married yet. I have nothing to give to you. By the authority vested in me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. Don't go anywhere. Hello. Hi, Mr. Fitzgerald. Yes. It's true. Yesterday afternoon. No, we didn't tell anyone. What did she write? That's not true. All right. We'll see you here tomorrow at 10:00. It's fine. Okay. What's wrong? Gossip columnist got ahold of the wedding. She wrote that youre the boyfriend Anne Briscoe's been screaming about all over the Hamptons. There's nothing to panic about. I'm just worried some political prosecutor will press for a murder indictment if Miss Briscoe keeps shooting her mouth off. Now I think you two should draw up new wills. If I could just get a list of assets... Youre looking at them. This is really out of my league. I'll let you talk to them. Excuse me. C.G. Morrison is very upset with you. Says youve cost him the best damned helmsman on the S.O.R.C. What do you think? I think he's a superb sailor. I hope he'll be as good a husband. We have a 459 in progress. - Check the car. - Yes, sir. What's the deceased's name? Anne Briscoe. Looks like she might have changed her mind. She was really clawing at the belt. What time? Somewhere between midnight and 2:00. I want an autopsy A.S.A.P. - What am I looking for? - Cause of death. Shortness of breath. Don't fuck with Dick Tracy. There is a suicide note, Mike. Right, a typed suicide note, unsigned. Real convincing. Okay, guys. You can go get her. Did you bring a body bag? - Hi. - Good morning. You slept late today. I sleep like a baby with you. I'm gonna go down to Obsession. have Mr. McGill do some minor work on Masquerade. Phone call, Miss Olivia. - Mr. Cantrell. - Thank you. Hello? Hi, Mr. Cantrell. Jesus! When? No, no, we-- Yes, I will. Thank you. Anne Briscoe killed herself last night. 6 x 6 or 9 x 9? 9 x 9. All right, here you go. - That's a 16-inch. - Yeah. What did Whalen want? He's checking on Obsession. She'll be in the water in six weeks. He's still working for Morrison. Yeah, but I'm not complaining. Now he's buying for two boats. Yeah, but I'm not complaining. Now he's buying for two boats. What's wrong with Masquerade? Propane line. They're gonna be cruising in the fall, so... ...he wanted it checked. That guy's a phony. If you ask my opinion, I don't think he won the grand prize. That kind of money is its own prison. Lock me up. You know what's funny? I know I could have made her happy. I know it. You can drive yourself crazy. Not me, Pop. Son of a bitch! It was worth every damn penny! - Is she gonna start winning? - She's gonna kick ass. If you come south and race her. Doesn't Olivia have a house in Florida? Hobe Sound. You really want to turn this boat over to somebody else? That's a low blow, Mr. Morrison. Whatever it takes to win. By the way, Mike McGill came over the other day. He was asking a lot of questions about you. That cop hates you. I noticed. Be careful. I remember him from the marina. He's been in love with your wife for years. Talk to her. Come to Florida. How would you like to go to Florida next month? Obsessions sailing better? Unbelievable. And Mr. Morrison wants you to do the Southern Racing Circuit. He knows we can win big. I have no objections. You don't? I think it would be quite pleasant being pregnant in Florida. You know how I've been feeling yucky these last couple of days? Well, I went to see Dr. Morton yesterday, and he didn't know what was wrong, so he ran a pregnancy test, and... But youve been on the pill. Yeah. It happens. Not very often, but it does happen. Oh, God, youre upset. No, I'm stunned. I just can't believe it. I'm very happy. You are? You are? Yeah. I said fine. I'll be there tonight. Okay, I'll see you. Does this mean what I think it means? This weekend? - It's stupid meeting here. - Chill out. Nobody comes up here at night. We have to talk. Talk? What's there to talk about? I can't kill her. When you improvised with Gateworth, that was fine with me... 50% is better than 33... but I am not about to let you walk away with 300 million all for yourself. - I don't give a shit about the money. - Right. That's why you married her. Look... It's gonna work out perfectly. Like you said, everybody knows I hate you. Christ, even the lawyers know I hate you. I clear you on accidental death, nobody's gonna question it. She's pregnant. Jesus Christ. Look, once the baby's born, it gets the money, so it's over. I don't give a fuck if she's having triplets! I have done too much to let that bother me. I spent a whole year of my life setting this thing up. I'm not gonna do it. Listen up, my friend, because youll only hear it once. Youre gonna do her, and we're gonna split a shitload of money, or youre going away for murder. Oh, really? What are you gonna use as proof? You forgot one thing in that bedroom... a glass with your fingerprints all over it. That puts you there that night. Ten to one I walk if it goes to a jury. I don't want to take your money and your life. There's another piece of evidence that's real conclusive. You planted something, you cocksucker. You just give me a fucking excuse. It's either her... or you. You just want her dead. That's what this is all about. Happy birthday. What's that smile for? I'm just happy. I'm so happy. It's only 7:15. What's the rush? It's a surprise. Hello, Raymond? Bring it around. Well? Do you like it? I love it! - Pardon? - Saint-Tropez. Youll be coming out of a sharp left-hand curve. There's a big elm tree just past the apex. I oiled the road. Without a seat belt, she's history. You wear yours, youll be okay. What are you worried about? A month from now youll be able to buy Ferraris in colors. Don't kill me. He just got it this week. Youre a fucking dead man. Just relax, all right? Relax. Youre gonna have plenty of time to relax. I figure like... ...15 to life. Youre going down for Gateworth. - I have an alibi. - Maybe. But what about Anne Briscoe? You killed Anne Briscoe. According to the evidence I found, you killed her. Your move, Romeo. Look, I told you I'm gonna do it, but I'm not gonna go crashing into a fucking tree. I could have been killed myself. Fine. My old man says Masquerade has already had problems with its propane line. It would be clean, easy. You disconnect the propane flexihose at the stove, roughen the edges with a file like a rat chewed it, caused a leak. - A rat? - Yeah, a rat. I'll put a big rat onboard. They'll find it and the hose in the wreckage. Accidental death guaranteed. It's gonna be tough getting her on the boat alone. Bullshit. You tell her youll meet her there at a certain time. She's always on time, right to the minute. She knows her boats. She sees the warning light, hits the pump... Boom. When do you leave for Florida? Next Thursday. I'm glad youre home. Brooke Morrison called. She wants us to have dinner tomorrow night. You sure you want to do it? Yeah. What's past is past. - I had a wonderful evening. - We'll see you tomorrow for lunch? Yeah, okay. We'll meet on the Obsession. Is there a bathroom I can use? Up the stairs, first bedroom. Thank you. Let's hear from you. I love you. Very sweet. Truce? Youd like that, wouldn't you? I'm glad you came up. Really? I wanted to thank you. I know about you and Tim, and with him sailing Obsession. I think it's better if we all remain friends. I really don't think you know the half of it. I don't know what you mean. I'm sure you don't. Gateworth died around 11:30, didn't he? And you and Prince Charming were already an item by then, weren't you? We were seeing each other. Seeing each other? I'm sure it was a little bit more than that, right, sweetheart? I just thought you might want to know... While you were plugging your stepfather, your husband was plugging me, and he was great. I wouldn't trust the prick if I were you. Is it true? Olivia, for Chrissakes, of course it's not true. - You said it was over by then. - It was. - Are you sure? - Olivia, think. She told you a time... 11:30. You know where I was at 11:30. I can do a lot of things, but I can't be in two beds at the same time. Brooke Morrison is a hopeless alcoholic. She's also insanely jealous. She was furious when I called it off. She's just doing this to get back at me and hurt you. It really hurt. That's what she wanted it to do. Don't ever lie to me. What's up, Sam? Just replacing the barient. Whalen came by, said it had to be done by tonight. What's the rush? I didn't think they were leaving until the end of next week. They moved it up. He said they're heading south tomorrow afternoon. Is that right? Yeah, that's what he told me. - You feeling okay? - Do I look okay? - Morning sickness? - Yeah. Oh, God. We don't have to leave today. Everybody says if youre going to be sick, youre going to be sick. It doesn't matter where you are. Let's just go. I'm sick of this town. 1:00? You gonna be on time? I wouldn't miss it. I'll buy groceries. I love you. Good. 28.40. Mrs. Whalen around? I'm afraid she's out. Mr. Whalen? He left about an hour ago. I'll wait around for a couple of minutes. - Tommy, fill it up, please. - Yes, ma'am. I know, I know, Alberto. Did she call? - Twenty minutes ago. - From the boat? From town. She said she'd be there at 1:00. On the nose. Yes, sir. Officer McGill came by looking for Mrs. Whalen. What did he want? I don't know. He waited inside for about ten minutes and then left. Okay. Thanks. This is a nice surprise. I thought I'd take you to lunch. Great. On you? Sure. Anything you want that's under a buck. The Masquerade is looking sharp. Varnished all her bright work last week. Olivia, get off the boat! If you get a chance to talk to any of those paramedics at all... Chief, what happened? Propane explosion. Lawrence's old sloop, the Masquerade. One D.O.A. Olivia Lawrence? No, her husband Tim Whalen. Damn shame. She's up in your father's office. Let's go. Oh, my God. Why? Why, Mike? God! Shit! You bastard! ...and may Timothy Whalen rest in peace. Amen. Thank you, Father, for coming. - I'm terribly sorry. - Thank you. - Sorry. - Thank you. Thank you for coming. There's something I have to tell you. Tim came to see me two weeks ago. Why? What about? To have himself taken out of your will. He made me swear that I wouldn't tell you, but now with what's come out, you have to know. I think somehow he wanted to have all temptations removed. I tried to dissuade him, told him it was against your wishes, but he was adamant. He wanted nothing from you. He loved you, Olivia. However it started, he came to love you.
