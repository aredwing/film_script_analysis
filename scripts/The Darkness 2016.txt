Honey, was lucky you have seen when it happened. because the damage is mostly superficial. It's just paint again when you have time. I can fix. I am very good with my hands. Now seriously, Peter ... How did he do that? I do not know. By accident, I think ... He was playing and caught fire. I did not mean it. How he got the matches? They are in the closet, on the refrigerator. Maybe we let down, or Stephanie, whatever. Okay, wait, wait. - I'm listening. - What I mean... Do you think it has to do with us? As parents. Wait a minute, please. Let's not start blaming us. Children are affected by problems and parental emotions, you heard Dr. Mitchell. And these expensive experts never miss it. You're not listening to me, Peter. What I mean is ... Sim? I think it has something else in the house. Wait, let's not start ... How do you explain the matches? How do you explain the smell? How do you explain the strange sounds? There are ghosts, honey. Just Autism Michael manifesting otherwise. Stop being a sucker and listen. Stephanie said she heard something too. Peter, maybe there is something here. I do not know, perhaps ... some kind of karma. Karma? Karma for what? Bad things we did? What, dear. Not really believe this nonsense, is not it? Can you please, please open your eyes? At least one time. Wait, Bronny. Defenseless?

No, do not bring it to me. Enough. They are ready for you to review. Give the rest later tonight. It's always like that? Yes, in fact that is the average of panic and confusion What makes this place so great. Maybe when this project is done, you and I can have a coffee, talk about how it will be going forward.

The House? What is it? Goblins and Fairies in the attic? - What have? - They are not interested in our novel. Thank you for dinner. I think we should go. - OK let's go. - Thanks, that was incredible. - Why are you angry? - What do you think? I embarrassed you in front of Simon? It is unpleasant to Wendy. He got in all our conversations, as if it did not matter if it was the only one talking. Honestly, it's unbearable. - It can be true. - It is true. But he's my unbearable boss, which will now tell everyone in the office my wife can not pass a dinner to say nothing of our personal and family problems. Thank you for dragging me there. Steph? Where is Michael? Mikey? Mikey? Mikey, dear. Honey, I said not to play until limpssemos here. Honey, do not put your hands on it, will leave marks all over the house. Open your mouth, buddy.

Right behind you. No! - Stephanie! - Looks! Skirt! - Stay with her. - Skirt! My God, are you okay? Jeff! His dog attacked my daughter! Unbelievable. They said to wait for someone to be available before registering it. About 20 minutes. All doors were locked. The front and back. I even locked. Someone must have the key, it is the only explanation. Tomorrow I will trade the locks and will check the doors and windows. I do not know. We'll all be fine. Peter, Mikey was in her room. Jeff, look ... Corvo. Lobo. Cobra. Buffalo. Coyote. I know it's hard, but we need to talk. Things got a little ... crazy here. For all of us. Really crazy. Not noticed the change of mood of Stephanie, or weight loss. Neither behavior your child is out of control. Now you want to talk? So I do not notice? It's all right. - It's not what you think. - Same? How can you not be what I think? Fuck you, Peter. You understand nothing. Not even. What is happening to us? Why did Peter? I was tired of me? No longer wanted his life with us? Jesus is talking about it now? The case did not mean anything. And I'm not like that anymore. But I'm still who I am. And it meant something to me. Good... As I said, I'm sorry. Clear... Sometimes apologizing is not enough. - Peter! - Porra. Why are you here? should not be in the office? It has been a ninja? I came to get some work to complete at home. Listen... Will I need a break. Things got worse with children and must take care of it. Of course, no problem. Clear. Listen. The other day, I was fighting with Wendy about this whole thing of magic that she was talking about. The truth is... A few years ago my son was about 4 or 5 years, he became ill and sick type. No style terminal. We took in all kinds of medical and specialist and no one knew, nothing helped. Then, a friend of my friend, told us about a healer. This she does, she heals. Type, wind spirits and water. Would you laugh if I told you the follies she spoke. She told us what to do. And we did. Step by step, every little thing. We did everything and a week later ... He was better. With life in his eyes again. And four weeks later I was playing baseball. This was miracle? I do not know what to call. Tells Bronny call Wendy that she will. But call this woman. Sometimes, the answer you are looking for ... will come from a place that is not looking. And again, you see? I need you, hombre . Need you. Call her. IMPORTAN PETER, LOOK AT THAT. They terrorized the population. Appeared to the children before taking them forever. The event was known as "The Darkness". And it started with the infestation of these creatures of darkness. Torment the victims to madness or painful deaths. In a desperate move, the Anasazi priests imprisoned demons the ritual of stones used to communicate. They hid them in caves near where they lived. If the stones were removed, the demons would be released, leading to the resurgence of "Darkness". ancient writings reveal that the curse can be broken if the stones are returned to the place of origin. And only one who is not afraid. There are many cases in which people found the stones, They died mysteriously. Families and friends happy turning each other. And many accidents leading to death and disaster. HI, SIMON. PLEASE SEND CONTAC WOMAN HELPED YOUR CHILD. - Here's and have a good night. - Thank you too. Jenny? No! Who's up there? Jenny, are you? My God. What the hell is this? Come. C'mon C'mon. All right, it's okay. - Sit down. - No, Dad, do not leave me. Okay, it's okay. I need you to calm down. It's all right. I'll be right back. Mikey! Mikey! Abra a porta! Mikey, come on, open a porta. Come on, open the damn door. Michael, abra a porta. Peter! Oi. Would I like a room, please. Clear. It's a weekday, you're in luck. But the only room available is the presidential suite. - We get it. - Of course. Some luggage, sir? What are you looking for? They have one in all hotel rooms. A Bible? I'm so tired I think I'll faint. They took the bibles of most hotel rooms. Really? Because? Apparently, some people found discriminatory only have a religious representative. - Jesus. - No longer. These days I was thinking about us. I was thinking of how we met. I admired him so much. And when I saw you was just ... Is still. Just love. We deserve a happy ending, Peter. I forgive you. We can win this. Together. I RECEIVED YOUR EMAIL. WENDY HAVE ANY INFORMATION. SAY TO BRONNY GO SEE IT. Oi, Bronn. Between. Between. To be honest, I never experienced anything like this. I do not know how to handle. I felt so everyone feels. Some people even believe, but I can guarantee, everything changes very fast when someone has the first meeting. I am Teresa number. I know you're upset, but do not worry. Just call her. She is very good. O world is full of things we can not explain, Bronn. For most people it's easier ... Focusing on what can be explained, but it does not make it less real inexplivvel. Who is this truck, Dad? People who came to help, buddy. Oi. Dear. This is Teresa, and this is your granddaughter, - Gloria. - Oi. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Steph, you can take Mikey and keep an eye on him? - I can. - Give us a moment. Thank you. English my grandmother is not much, but I'll help. Someone brought something new or strange to the house? No, I think not. recently they have been somewhere? The somewhere that have never been before? We went camping a few months ago, Duch Canyon, Grand Canyon, Canyon High. It is a very important area. It is the home of the Anasazi. The Navajo people consulted the elders once. He said they talked with powerful spirits. Demons, spirits and dark creatures. And they had rituals to keep the ancient demons trapped in another dimension. A place they call the Third World. Yeah, I read something about it. So the Anasazi hidden rituals, anyone open the door and let these beings enter our world. Are you saying that ... it's real. There are five most feared demons, but their names can not be pronounced. It is known that manifest as crow coyote, snake, buffalo or wolf. It is not the true way. If all five appear, it will be a disaster. What they want? They bring darkness to the people, for them to destroy, or destroy one another. When the wolf walks the spirit will be free again to devour two innocent soul. They are strengthened. What is she saying? She said we should hurry, they will not stop until they get what they want. Let's start by cleaning the house. Closing portals and make disappear spirits. The forces of darkness are everywhere. Do you believe in a higher power? Not really. Now would be a good time to start. You will not need that? There are other things that have worked here. The God you're used to, can not help you. This is the house of the living, not the dead or those in the field of death. We wish to seek the light and go back to where they came from! Stay close. This is the house of the living, go back to where they came from! Continue. Here it is. Wait here. Let's deal with it. This is the house of the living, go back to where they came from! You do not belong to this house! Get out of here! This is the house of the living, go back to where they came from! You do not belong ... You do not belong to this house! Teresa, are you okay? What is going on? The spirits are trying to stop us from cleaning the house and send them away. Go back to where they came from! You do not belong here! Get out ... - Wait here! - Dad! Peter! Are you alright? They are getting stronger. Fast! Mother! - Was you? - I am here. They will not hurt us. They will set us free. Michael! Are you alright? You do not belong to this house! Get out of here! This is the house of the living, go back to where they came from! You do not belong to this house! Get out of here! Are you alright? There is a great evil here. We have to finish to protect the house before anything else pass here. We have to hurry, my daughter. Fast, mother. I see a river. A cave. Stones. Blood. Fire. A river of blood? The death of innocents? No! You do not belong to this house! Get out of here! You do not belong to this house! Get out of here! - Teresa, are you okay? - Grandma, you are well? - Grandfather? - She is fine? - Where's Mikey? - What is going on? Mikey? Mikey. Mikey. Mikey! Mikey, abra a porta. Mikey?
