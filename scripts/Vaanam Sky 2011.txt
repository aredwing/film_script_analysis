Look properly. I'm taller than Singam. Did you see? - Get down! Don't pull my shirts! - Go and sit at the bathroom! Where is kidney, father in law? How they will take it? It is here. - You said it was injury caused by fence. It's not the fence. It was the doctor's knife. This is the same train I took last year.. To do the operation to settle Narasimman's debts. The only property that poor have is their kids. I didn't study. My son didn't study too. And so do you. At least if he studied, he can be better in life. That is true. He must study. And become an important person. Because of that I can sell whatever part my body have. Watch you own work! I'll show you who am I! We should done something right. They met in accident right. There is pal to help them. They will take care. It is not only us can help. Anyone can help them. Anyone can help. But not us. Because we only sing. Why everyone is so alert today? - Stop.

But now you bringing me to snatch chains. I can't do it anymore. One tea please. Raja, you doing wrong again and again. You should born in a rich family. But born to a poor one. Even educated you have come to be a snatcher. The main thing is you have attempt to snatch Priya's mother herself. Is that Priya? She look like a heroin. - I worked hard to get her. But it is great your attempt to snatch her things to get her daughter. What caste is she? - Rich caste. Only two cast in this world. One who have everything, and another like us who have nothing. Caste is not important, but cash. I was surprised why no calls from her yet. Try to settle the problem. Our caste must change. I came to see you. Later evening ask for sorry to my mom. Have you bought the passes? - I am going there now. To whom you're talking to? I need the money. - How do you talk with rhyme? We will get it however. Because we have to change our caste! You are the one called? - Yes. Muthuiah? She's the one? Let's go straight to the hospital. What if he didn't come? Now your name is Vengataraman. Not Muthuiah. So she's not your daughter in law. But your own daughter. She's Revathy. Your brother's name is Jayaraman. You're donating kidney to your brother's son Varatarajan. So for you he's your brother's son. And for you, he's brother. Do you get me? Remember what I said. We have jack right. - Yes, we have jack but doesn't have air. You didn't stop there. But your car stopped here. There is God watching everything. I will make sure this thing won't repeat again. So make sure you don't let this things happen too. I told Him. Is it ok? Why are you talking about the past? Think of what need to be done now! Four of you play with the tyres. - In this middle of thejungle? They only flght when we're around. But later they will be so caring to each other. Why do you always tight with me?! - Not me, its you. What you don't like about me? -I don't like the way you sing. Doesn't have soul in it. It must come from deeper inside. My father wrote it. So I tried just because it sound nice. Nowadays who focus on the lyrics? What's that mean? It will be a nice song if put nice lyric in it. So what do you like in me? I like your singing. God have gave you a gift. A good voice and music sense. But the sense is only on music. - At least I have sense in something. You're getting so mad while the new year getting near. Look there. I'll go near, you snatch it.
