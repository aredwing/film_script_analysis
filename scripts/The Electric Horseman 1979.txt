He drawed old Little Venus over in Fairview. - Let's send him some luck. - I don't think he's gonna need it. You stayed on worse than Little Venus before. Ain't no worse than Little Venus. The hell there ain't! Nameless was worse than Little Venus, and he did eight on Nameless. Nobody done Nameless since then. I ain't on Nameless anymore! And I got no intention of bein'. That was a little compliment there. Here's a ranch for sale here in Baily, 450 acres. I thought you should've got that place out at Spanish Fork instead of that Malibu house. Oh, Spanish F - What's the matter with the Malibu house? I don't remember your mindin' it so much. I remember you was in the water half the time, wearin'them flippers on your feet, lookin'dumb, actin'like a damn penguin. Hey, what's the matter with you pickers?

Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's half-time highlight, the all-time great cowboy, five-time all-around world champion, Sonny Steele.! Sonny Steele appears tonight... through the courtesy of Ranch Breakfast, a division of Ampco Industries. Well, what in the hell? That's not me. They don't know the difference. What's your name? How come you're so cute? It's good to see you. Right this way. What time's the press conference? Got half an hour. Hello, Hallie. Now, if there's anything you need, anything at all, just say the word. We've got about half a dozen movie people here. Uh, Bud Broderick, Joanna Camden just came in. Rising Star is here. What are you gonna do with the horse? He's appearing onstage with Sonny Steele. He's the cowboy we use in Ranch Breakfast. Do you think he's worth covering? Well, there's better stuff than that. The cowboy's a peach of a guy, but that's just a lot of"yups" and "shucks," and stufflike that. He's no interview. Better steer clear him. I'll see you downstairs. Bernie! So, they don't want us to talk to the cowboy. Where do you want to start? I gotta get a sandwich. What do you mean, "where do I want to start?" Excuse me, please. Where the hell is he? I don't know. He's probably drunk in Barstow somewhere. Uh, excuse me. Could you tell me if Mr. Sonny Steele has checked in yet? No, ma'am. He's not listed. It's an interesting watchband. Thank you. It's Indian. May I see it? Sure. Oh, it's lovely. Why does Ampco say absolutely no interviews with Sonny Steele? Who told you that? One of the people at Ampco. That don't really mean anything, you know. Sonny hasn't been himself lately. They've been a little down on him here. But he's okay. He's just a cowboy. Sometimes he loses the best part of himself. What is the best part of himself? - You'd have to know him a long time to know that. - How long have you known him? Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold And they'd rather give you a song than diamonds and gold Lone star belt buckles and old faded Levi's And each night begins a new day If you don't understand him and he don't die young He'll probably just ride away Hey, come on over here! Let's go! C'mon! That's it. Sonny, where'n the hell you been? What's he doin' in a parking lot? I don't know, but he got here on time. C'mon. Press conference has started, and Danny Miles has been waitin' all day to rehearse you. Who's Danny Miles? Well, here you are. Here you are. What do I have to do? There's been hell to pay, what with the newspapers. So just behave yourself. Boy, you smell like a tequila factory. Here, no, take- Put these Tic-Tacs in your mouth. You're never gonna guess who I seen? Who? Rush and Hawkman, and old Edgar. Yeah? Hey, watch it there, partner! They all send their hellos. Uh-huh. Foggy Tates' wife Louise gave me this handkerchief. I told you he was in Barstow! Smells just like her too. Whew! God they got pretty girls in Las Vegas! This is a serious thing to these people. I've never seen 'em so nervous. They're tryin' to buy this big bank. They want everything to go just perfect. Hold it. What's in here? It's a press conference. Don't tell no jokes, don't lift up nobody's dress, okay? What do I have to say? Nothin', if we're lucky. C'mon. john,you had a question. Do you anticipate opposition to the takeover of Omnibank? just a moment. It isn't a takeover, it's a merger. But Omnibank has always opposed takeovers, mergers. We think that attitude's changing. We've made a generous tender offer for the Omnibank shares. We're confident they'll accept it. Troy? Troy, you look like you're gonna jump outta that seat. Do you have a question? For Mr. Broderick. Bud,you've played opposite just about every great motion picture actress. Yes, I have. Who, in your opinion, is the best kisser? That depends. What part of the body are you talking about? Print that. I dare you. Mr. Steele, why were you 45 minutes late to the press conference? Well, I... I'd like to apologize... for that. I was, uh- I was givin' mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a bottle of tequila. And we lost her too. Do you, in fact, eat Ranch Breakfast for breakfast? We'll, ma'am, I eat steak and eggs for breakfast. You were three times - I eat Ranch Breakfast for lunch. You're a three-time all-around world champion cowboy. Five. Five-times all-around world champion cowboy. Now you're selling cereal. How do you feel about that? Lady, I don't want to tangle with you. Listen, w-we've got, uh, we've got a time problem here right now. Now,you are all invited by our chairman, Mr. Hunt Sears, to a reception across the hall... just before the performance, and enjoy yourselves, will ya? And thank you. Sonny, we got a rehearsal. What was that all about? Rehearse what? I don't know. Let's go. After you circle, you stop on your mark stage left, lean forward in the saddle, face the audience, wave, greet them- Where's the horse? Bring in the damn horse. Spot please.! God! He's a beauty. Tom, Sonny rides in, circles three times. Applause, applause, applause. Then stops on the mark. Sonny, your first line is - What've you got him on? Uh, a little Bute and some penicillin. This tendon, it oughta be braced and bandaged. - They think it don't look right with the public. - Uh, hello! What do you mean they don't think - Sonny, the first thing you do after you stop is,you say - Your horse is stoned. How else we gonna get him on the stage with all these lights and everything? Excuse me, gentlemen! We're trying to rehearse. Sonny, your first line: "Ranch Breakfast, a champ's way to start the morning." Then you look at the horse and you say, "Ain't that right, Rising Star? If you agree, don't say anything." It's fun. It's fun. You try it. "Ranch Breakfast, a champ's way to start the morning. Wonderful, but much, much bigger.! Much bigger. Louder. "Ranch Br-" There's more. There's more. I saw it. That's the most discourteous thing I ever saw in the theater. Sonny, this is Hunt Sears. He ain't no Ampco flunky. This it here? You ain't in no shape to see no Hunt Sears. What I gotta do first,jog? Dual overhead cam shafts. Fully-enclosed drive shaft. Dual disc brakes in front. Each item... will appear in several magazines during the month ofJuly. As an example of our confidence in the success of these new fashions, Ampco will be sending these lovely models on a one-month tour... throughout the- Sonny. I'd like you to say hello to Carol. Hi. How are you? Well then, let's- Carol's interested in television commercials. Hey, Sonny, I want to get my son a horse. What kind do you think is best? How old is your kid? He's six years old. Get him a short horse. Hey, Hallie.! Hallie Martin.! We met in New York, remember? Did we like each other? That question about the Omnibank merger... who was that guy? That was Cross, the Washington Bureau of the Times. The New York Times? Yeah. He's connected to Treasury. He shouldn't have been at the conference. Spilt milk. Sonny, here's a couple I'd like you to meet. Mr. and Mrs. Phillips. Hi. Steve Phillips, the Million Dollar Club. Sold a million dollars worth of Ranch Breakfast last year. Oh, well, the mean-question lady. Wholesale. - I'm just curious. - Steve Phillips. How do you do? You know what curiosity did to the cat? The Million Dollar Club. He sold a million dollars worth of Ranch Breakfast last year. Are you kiddin' me? No.! No.! - That's just fantastic. - We're very proud of it. I'll bet you are, and I am too. Damn! Good. I just love that. This is Grace Phillips. I'm Grace Phillips. I just love that. We met too. Everything's goin' 'round and 'round. That poster's beautiful. It's a great gimmick. It's very effective, Sonny. Grace, stand in front... of that poster with Sonny, and Steve can take your picture to bring home? No. Why don't you just take the picture of Grace in front of that picture of me, of the box with the picture of me on the box, holding a picture of me with a picture of me? Then you got Grace, and you got a whole bunch of pictures of me. Sonny, I've been looking for you. You know that TV show in Denver? We've had to make some changes in your copy. I bet it's shorter. Well, the multimedia situation is - Mr. Sears? Hello, Sonny. It's about time we finally met, isn't it? Yes, sir, it's about time. Everybody here know Mr. Steele? How do you like our horse? Couldn't have found you a better straight man. - Could I have a word with you, sir? - Perhaps later, Mr. Steele. It's a beautiful animal, isn't it, Sonny? Yes, sir, he's an amazin' animal, but he don't belong in a parkin' lot in Las Vegas. I don't suppose Las Vegas is the most natural place in the world for any of us, is it? Well, I don't know, sir. I don't think he's feelin' so good. Well, let's give him a drink. Rising Star represents a substantial investment. You can be sure we've entrusted his care to experts. I don't think them experts are so expert. Mr. Steele, would you please sign this picture for me? You bet. For my daughter Tammy. Thank you. Why don't I make an appointment with Mr. Sears this afternoon? Why would you put that horse out on the stage with a bunch of dancin' girls? Just a minute, Mr. Steele. I'm talkin' to him. It sells product, Sonny. You mustn't apply logic to advertising. It'll just confound you. Believe me. Well, it just don't feel right. It seems wrong- all them lights blinkin'and winkin: and girls, horse- Sir, I used to rodeo... and I was good at it. That's irrelevant. To who? Sonny, this is a conversation I think we might have some other time. -Would it matter? -It matters that you fulfill the requirements of your contract, which don't include your passing judgment on corporate policy. Nothin' in that contract about me ridin' around on toy horses. You're not in rodeo anymore. Actually, you're more famous now. Aren't you? Your face is on millions ofboxes. You're on billboards all over the country. People want your autograph. What I'm talking about is you voluntarily accepted... a highly-paid, relatively simplejob... that more than a handful of cowboys would give their right arm for. You're right. I don't want just to be right. You want me to like it? It would be a factor in our working relationship. Mr. Sears,Joanna Camden... is waiting over here by the Earth Mover, so why don't we have the pictures taken? - Excuse us, please. - Ah, you bet. I'm sorry, sir. When this is over, get rid of him. Telephone call for Miss Avis. Ellen Avis, please. Telephone call for Mr. Yanna. Mr.John Yanna, please. Charlotta! Hey! Got a quarter? No, don't say it. I bet that check's in the mail. Sonny! Wendell handles all that anyway, babe. You know that. Come talk to me. How is old Wendell who can't find a stamp? Bartender? Give us a double Jack Daniels, please, tall glass. The lady'll take a Rob Roy. Orangeade. I quit. Wha- What's the matter? You're not "born again," are ya? Maybe I am. I got me a record contract now. All on my own too. You be sure and tell Wendell Hixon that. You're sure tough on ol' Wendell, not that I blame you, checks bein' late and all. I don't wanna talk about the checks. Princess Fatima. You know what I wanna talk about. I want you to sign these papers! You don't think I saw you tryin' to slip outta here? I left three messages at the desk. No, wait a minute. I didn't get no messages. Sonny, that judge told you to sign the papers. Don't you wanna be divorced for real? Yes, I do. I just- Well, I been busy. Busy? Doin' what? Makin' up excuses? Excuses? You got somebody now... sits up all night 'cause you lost your keys, or you got a flat tire? Comin' home at 6:00 in the mornin', expectin' me to cook breakfast for a dozen cowboys, 'cept some of'em was cowgirls who didn't bother to look like... they hadn't been in the backseat of your car. Charlotta, yoo-hoo, you got a mean memory. Just a couple of parties- A couple? That light-up suit must've given you shock treatment! I'm talkin' a lot of parties and a lot of backseats. If it hadn't been for backseats, babe, we'd have never met. And I'll bet you're still doin' it. Telephone call for Mr. Hopkins. Stayin' up all night, burnin' yourself out. You'rejust walkin'around to save funeral expenses. Well, you smile, baby. You get my insurance. Do you know what your skeleton looks like in them X-rays? Ajunkyard! You couldn't get through an airport metal detector stark naked. Gimme the papers. Huh? Gimme the papers. - For real? - Give 'em to me. Telephone call for Mr. Klein. Mr. Mike Klein, please. Princess Fatima. Princess Fatima, please. You look like hell. And you look great. Hey, would ya come up to my room? I can't. You just know what'd happen. Yeah! Besides, I got somebody who really likes me now. That's not hard to do. - Who's the lucky fella? - Billy Roy Fix! - Billy Roy Fix? - Uh-huh. Is that right? Well, I guess there's just somethin' about us Western stars. Mr. Sonny Steele, report to the backstage area. Oops, that's me. I'm late. Good-bye, darlin'. Bye, darlin'. Take care, huh? Disco magic Disco magic Disco magic Move it up, move it down Listenin'to the funky sound Disco magic Disco magic Shake your thing to the beat Makes you wanna move your feet Disco magic Disco magic It's so inviting but you really can't It's so exciting makes you wanna dance I don't know what it is but I never wanna miss Disco magic Disco magic Stayin'out on the floor I just wanna have some more Disco magic Disco magic It sends a rhythm right down to your soul Well, Mr. Steele. The magic makes you wanna lose control Disco magic After this number, the motorcycle daredevil. God save us.! And then you and the horse. Disco magic Disco magic Now listen,you don't start those things... until I give you the cue, yes? Move it up, move it down Listen to the funky sound Disco magic Disco magic Shake your thing to the beat Makes you wanna move your feet Not now! Not now! Not now! It's so inviting Puts you in a trance It's so exciting Makes you wanna dance Open the curtain. Thought he was confused? Wasn't he 'spose to? The hard way. Ho, ho, ho.! Disco magic Disco magic Forget the routine. Go right into the finale. Mr. Miles.! Mr. Miles.! That was very effective, and this is no criticism, but I think it's too dangerous to use that horse on a ramp. He wasn't supposed to be on the ramp! He wasn't even supposed to be out there yet! He's ruined the whole concept! I gotta run to keep from hidin' And I'm bound to keep on ridin' And I got one more silver dollar And I ain't gonna let 'em catch me, no I ain't gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider - What did he say? - He was rude, very rude, and he wasn't concentrating. He must've said something to you. He was askin' a lot of questions about the horse's tendon and the drugs. Drugs? Just a second. What drugs? - Uh, well, the tranquilizers- - That's done all the time. They tranquilize the animal to keep it calm. The butazoladine... they use for the tendon. Mutual Indemnity. The Nevada State Police. Which do you want? Neither. Keep this quiet. You might as well know the rest, Mr. Sears. Sonny knows horses. I think he's guessed we've used steroids to muscle him up. Are they dangerous? Well, they make the horse sterile. Temporarily! Temporarily. Sterile. It's just a side effect. It's not a permanent thing. What are we gonna do, put that on a box top? "Temporarily." Look, i-it goes away in how many hours? Gentlemen, would you excuse us? There are drinks upstairs. Ah, the world of illusion! Just a minute, fellas. I'll be right out. Gee! We're not talking about a horse. We're talking about a $300 million merger. Omnibank is gonna make a feast outta this. If Steele talks to anyone before he's caught, we have no merger. - Ampco and the horse are the same thing. - Hunt, I don't- If we've mismanaged the horse, we've mismanaged the corporation. Couldn't he have called the S.P.C.A.? What are we gonna say to the reporters? Tell 'em to go to bed. It's a little late for that. Excuse me. And get those morons out of here. Come on, Bob. One drunken cowboy! "We have been advised... "by the Attorney General of the State of Nevada... "that the theft of Rising Star is grand larceny, a felony. "In the event that this proves to be a deliberate act, "a felony warrant will be issued for Mr. Steele. At this time, however, our primary concern is the welfare of our horse." What did he say to Sears at the reception? They were really going at each other. Hallie, gimme a break, will ya? Ransom! What about ransom? The man's not that crazy. Listen, he's been tossed on his head enough times. You thought about brain damage? Look, the cowboy's a little hot-tempered. He's emotionally disturbed. That's all. Who isn't? C'mon, Fitz. What're you saying? That's he's made a mistake and he's gonna bring it back when he's had time to cool out? Oh, come on! Let me alone, will ya? I don't know any answers. I don't know from brain damage. I don't know from "cooling out." There's a convention here. Go have a sauna. Give me some good news, for chrissake! "Cool... out." ...these days. Why'd she quit him? God knows. Sonny was married right in Gus's living room. When that woman quit him, you know where Sonny came to cool himself out? Of course, Gus is gettin' old and strange these days. ...you know where Sonny came to cool himself out? Of course, Gus is gettin' old and strange these days. Princess Fatima. Princess Fatima, please. Seen Wendell? No, I haven't. I haven't seen nobody. Just runnin' around like crazy people today. Buy you a drink? No, thanks. I got one. That's my limit. That's all I ever drink. Tell me something. Just something personal. Were you surprised he did it? Who, Sonny? Well, Sonny'll surprise ya. It's just that some surprises are bigger than others. Like he gave me this ring one day,just like that. Had ol' Wendell's teeth fixed for 'im too. What's your last name? Smitley. Say, you know something? We got a mutual friend. Oh, we do? Who do we know? Gus Atwater. I know Gus. Do you know ol' Gus? Where do you know Gus from? Oh, sure. Wait. Are we talkin' about the same Gus, from Tuba City? No, not Tuba City. The Gus I'm talkin' about is from Mesquite. It's about 30 miles up here. Mesquite. Hey, you wanna drive? - Morning. - Hello. You got any, uh, eucalyptus leaves? You must be a Capricorn. You got any eucalyptus leaves? Just tea bags. Well, I need some of them tea bags. How many would you like? Oh, five or six dozen. Bags? Boxes. Come on, boy. Come on, son. Just a couple more times of doin' this, you'll be breathin'just fine, if I live. Mr. Atwater? Golden Hills 'Round her head Glimmer Golden Hills You Mr. Atwater? Ya wounded? No. I'm looking for a friend of ours. - He ain't here. - But he was. Yep! From about this high. Was he here today? Here today, gone tomorrow. Like a flutterin' bird! Hey, who are you? I work for television. You know television? Yeah, I got one. Works sometime. Comes a-flashin'! Woo-woo-woo! Gus, I'm a friend of Leroy's. Leroy! Oh-ho! Yeah. And, uh... and Wendell. He told me you'd know where to find him. How else would I know where you were, huh? We're real worried about him. I gotta find him. I have to talk to him. I can't hurt him. He came here... covered with a mist. You know? Like it floats atop a river? A-A-And it grows into a cloud. And it shuts away the sun. Where'd he go, Gus? Agh! No, please! What? No, wait! No! How did you find me? What are you doing? You're hurting me. Stop it. What do you want? Who's with you? How did you find me? I'm alone. I swear to God. How did you get here? I drove myself. How? How did you find me? Gus. Gus Atwater. Gus? Gus. Can I- Can I get up now? Please? How did you know to get to Gus? Oh, I- I interviewed your friends. Who? Wendell and Leroy. I figured they'd- Wait a minute. You hit my face, you son of a bitch! I'm not gonna stay here. What did you take the horse for? You're crazy. Does anybody else know about Gus? No. No, nobody knows anything- Oh, I'm crazy? You go off with somebody else's $12 million horse, and you tell me I'm crazy? Hold it. Hold it. Don't you... hit me. Did you scare that old man? No. Does anybody else know you're here? No! Nobody knows anything. I don't have any reason to tell anybody anything. Go away. Go home. Well, what are you gonna do with him? Look,just tell me why you took the horse. You can't race him. Y-You can't sell him. And you're not gonna start your own cereal company. I mean, what the hell do you want? Can't you just answer one question? Look, I don't have anything against you. I don't usually get hit doing this, but I'm not- What'd you expect, sneakin' up like some cat? I tried to call you, but your line was busy. Do you know how worried your friends are about you? Wendell and Leroy? Isn't there something I can tell them? What is this place? Does this have some, uh, special meaning to you? You want information, go to the library. I know what you want. It ain't answers. You just want a story... any story. Why don't you make one up? That's what you all do anyway. Go ahead, make one up. You don't need me to tell you no story! You ask me questions, why I'm 45 minutes late. You're not interested in why I'm late. Just interested in gettin' a rise outta me. "Do I eat Ranch Breakfast?" Now, who the hell cares? You people are all the same. There's folks in Africa, when you try to take a picture of them, they'll kill ya. They figure that you're tryin' to take something away from 'em, and you got just so much stuff. And if other people are tryin' to take it all, then you got nothin' left for yourself. Well, I don't wanna be no story! I've just retired from public life. Have you got that wrong! You road down the Las Vegas strip with somebody else's horse. Did you think we wouldn't notice? You're a story, all right. But not yours. I'm nobody's story but my own now. B-But wait! Wait a minute. Where you going? Oh, I hurt your feelings, didn't I? I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Was it something I said? Look, can't you do a working girl a favor? I'm just trying to earn an honest buck, tell an honest tale. I don't want to make up a story about you. What have you got to lose? What's the big secret? Everybody wants to know. They're wondering where you're going, why you did it. You know, the truth about the great American cowboy and the world champion horse... riding together into the sunset. Boy, are you full of shit! With all due respect, ma'am. And you're standin' in poison sumac. Oh! Come on, son. Come on, boy. If you think you're getting away from me, you're not. 'Cause I'm gonna follow you. I'm gonna follow you 'til you tell me what you're gonna do with the horse. What are you doing? Oh, my God! It shouldn't take you more than about 15 minutes to change that. Goddamn you! You're absolutely nuts! I'm gonna call the cops, 'cause I got your license plate. No, you won't. - Yes, I will! - No, you won't. I know what you'll do. You'll milk this story for all it's worth. You don't want me to be captured. A captured horse thief ain't no story. It was from this hotel... that Rising Star, greatest money winner in the history of American racing... and presently corporate symbol for one of the world's largest conglomerates, was taken late Friday night. Yesterday I was able to uncover information which allowed me to locate Sonny Steele. Now to raise the old Stars and Stripes. Where's that blasted flagpole? Good gracious.! A bird's nest.! Hee-hee. How clumsy of me. I hope I didn't step... on your eggs, birdie.! You got any shoelaces? - What? - Shoelaces? Anita, get rid of that stuff! Over here by the cash register. ...by the dim glow of a shrouded campfire, I saw Rising Star, and I encountered Sonny Steele himself. - What? What? - What? - We talked together for many hours. - What? As a result of our wide range in conversation, I formed these impressions:: Mr. Steele, in my opinion, did not take the horse for monetary gain. He has no intention of ransoming- - Where is he? - I don't know. - Where was he? - I forgot. How were you able to find him? That's my job. What did he tell you, Hallie? Nothing. Miss Martin, if you want a story, we could put you right in the middle of the story. We could guarantee that you get first crack at everything. I've already had first crack at everything. Suppose we made it exclusive? How 'bout if we gave you... exclusive footage on the capture? When are you planning that? And you want to tell me about that confrontation you had at the reception, Mr. Sears? - What was that all about? - Miss Martin, we could take you to court. You could try. Aiding a felon during the commission of a felonious act? Concealment of a felony? Misprision of felony, that's what the law calls it. Well, you're not the law. If Ampco wants to take on the First Amendment Right, be my guest. That oughta sell America a whole lot of breakfast cereal. I'll be around if you want to handcuff me later. We could take her to court. We could have her locked up. And gain what? Last thing we need is a female martyr. At least he didn't say anything about mistreating the horse. - Do we know that? - I think she would've said something on the air. You think? That's a chance we can't afford to take. Well- Do we have a choice? We could make sure that if he speaks to anyone, he won't be believed. Can you get to the media by the 11:00 news? How the hell'd she find him? We ain't even heard from him. I know how she found him. We sent her over there, that's how she found him. Well, she buddied up to me. She tried to buy me drinks. She said she liked my ring. Yeah, she liked your ring. She liked my watch. I liked her eyes. That's how those people are. They tell you they're your friend, and they use you. What are we gonna do? I don't know what you're gonna do. I'm gonna get me a bottle of tequila, one of those Keno girls... that can suck the chrome off a trailer hitch, then kinda kick back. It's 10::59 here at KLSG, St. George. Here's Harvey Del Rio for Rudolph Brothers- If I could drive sleepin' the way you sleep standin', we'd have this thing licked. In Las Vegas, investigators still have no leads... to the whereabouts of Rising Star, the great thoroughbred stallion... whose abduction by Sonny Steele Friday triggered a massive search. Ampco officials are now expressing alarm over the welfare of the horse. According to one official, Steele has a long history of alcoholism and drug abuse. In the past year, he's appeared before the public intoxicated on several occasions, and has been abusive to both press and public. They believe that if the horse is to survive the ordeal, time is of the essence. Telephone call for Mr. Martin. Mr. Alan Martin, please. Excuse me. Miss Martin, I'm Charlotta Steele. I was married to Sonny. Yes, I know. I don't mean to bother you, but I was wondering if he was all right. He isn't hurt? No. Are you gonna be seein' him again? We haven't made any plans. Why? Just wondering. Why do you think he did it? I don't know. I don't know. He gets ornery, and I guess it takes him a long time to admit he's got a horn in his gut. What is the horn in his gut, Mrs. Steele? Alls I know is, he must've had a good reason, or else he would've been back by now. He's no thief by nature. I mean, it takes your breath. You know, they only said those bad things about him. They didn't say what's decent, even though it is... hard to find it sometimes. How'd you meet Sonny? Hallie Martin, please. What? You alone? Who is this? Are you alone? Okay, fella. Say your dirties. Get it over with. I think it's about time for another wide-ranging conversation. Hello? Is it you? Right from the dim glow of the shrouded campfire. You maniac. I broke three nails changing that tire. - You want a story? - Yes. Can you get outta there without anybody knowin'? If I can't, I won't come. Who saw him? Some little shopkeeper in southern Utah, near St. George, about 5:00 last night. He must've gotten a vehicle somewhere. He's been heading northeast, so if he stopped for the night, he should be somewhere within 150 miles of St. George. Who knows this? Local police are all taken care of. Nobody else. The press? No, not yet. Not yet. We'll take care of it. Can we cover the surrounding towns in time? Taking care of it right now. I think we should concentrate on Liberty and Cedarville. All right. You and Toland take the jet. Take the security people with you. You can organize this from St. George. Ifhe stopped for the night. We've got to assume that he sleeps sometimes. He's crossed the state line. The F.B.I. will want in. Can you keep them out? They know he's been spotted. They'll be crawling all over the place. Then get to him first. Offer him whatever you have to. Tell him we won't prosecute. Do whatever you have to do! Don't let him start up with any nonsense about the horse. I'm here! Hey, I'm here! I'm alone. No troops. C'mon. Ooh! Oh! God! I think I've broken my leg. What are you gonna do, shoot me? Okay, get your camera ready. Uh, listen, would you mind standing right over here... with that background? No. This is all right. Right here. But I think - I'm sorry. I think it'd be more dramatic over here - Tell 'em it was dramatic. You got a colorful imagination. Listen, I am cold and tired, and I've been driving all night. And I'm not used to being talked to like- I'm not used to being talked about like I was a horse thief. Well, what do you call a man who steals horses? Have you ever seen this horse race? Have you ever seen him- I've seen him run. I saw him stumble, fall back and lose his stride, and pick himself up. I saw him stretch himself out... when he had nothin' left to give, but he found it... somewhere. And he won. Lady, that horse is a champion, and he's got a heart the size of a locomotive. He's got more heart and more drive, and more... soul than most people you'll ever know. And they're hangin' lights all over him. They're trottin' him around on stages with dancin' girls. Ta-ta-da-da-ta-ta! They'd have him wearin' short pants and smokin' a cigar... if they thought it'd sell their damn junk! Look it.! They got him all tanked up on tranquilizers and Bute. They're stickin' him full of needles! Look at this tendon! It's all filled up. He's shot all full of steroids. And it's just for looks. Makes the horse sterile. So even if they - God, this is so damn funny. Even if they wanted to breed him, even if they wanted to pass on some of them fine qualities, they couldn't. To say nothin' what the horse hisself is missin'. So- So I took him. C'mon, let's go. Get this- Crank up this little hummer, and I'll... give ya... a speech, or try. All right? Anytime you're- Can you see me? Can you see the horse? Yeah. Just keep going. I can see everything. Uh, this here is Sonny Steele. And, uh, his name is Rising Star. And he's one of the best. He's one of the greatest animals in the... in the history of... animals. Maybe they bought him. Maybe they own him. But there are some rights you can't buy, even from an animal. Now, this horse earned a better life, and I'm gonna try and see that he gets it. How're you gonna do that? I'll do it. Appreciate your comin'. You got stamina. It's a family trait. You'll forgive me... if I'm not set up for entertainin'. I gotta tend this horse, and get him movin'. Listen! Can I- Can I come with you? - No! - Why? I wouldn't be any- Trouble? No! Here, let me give you my card. Your what? My card. Sometimes you think of something you forgot to say, or wish you'd said. Steele, what are you gonna do with him? I told ya. You didn't tell me anything. Enough. - Why does it have to be such a big secret? - So they can't stop me. From doing what? I'm gonna turn him loose. What? Rising Star? I'm gonna get him back to where he was, what he was. It's in his blood. He knows what to do, he's just half forgot is all. But he's a thoroughbred race horse. He's delicate. Maybe it isn't gonna work. Maybe it won't work. Maybe he ain't gonna make it. Where you gonna do this? But at least he's gonna try, have his own shot at it. Where? Where? Where? Have a safe trip back, miss. Miss, my ass! Where you gonna turn him loose? Do you know? I know. Who else knows? I don't know. Maybe he does! Why don't you interview him? You're gonna screw up your whole life. I'm tryin' to unscrew it, lady! Wendell Hixon says that you forgot the best part of yourself. Wendell! He's a good man, Wendell. Is it true? Nope. Charlotta says that you screw up- Charlotta? You got her in on this too? Don't tell me! She says you take her breath away. Yeah, well that's not hard to do. She's all breath anyway. Uh... She's, uh- She's pretty. Yes, she is pretty. She said when you two first met, you - Oh. Wait a minute. There was that place, that canyon where you went on your honeymoon. Damn that woman! With wild mustangs. God...damn that woman! Rib Rock! Rim Rock! That's why I left her. That's exactly why I left her. Her and her big m- Er, she left me. Anyway, I'm not goin' to no Rim Rock Canyon. Then I have an idea. Let's go into town... and have a cup of coffee, and talk about it. My treat. Huh? I'm not gonna be - No. I'm not gonna be passin' a- Now where'd I put that son of a bitch? Oh, here it is. I'm not gonna be passin' a mailbox, so if you'd- It's got a stamp on it. Yeah, first one I pass. All right. Well- What do I do? Just take this road back to the broken tree? Yeah. Same way you came, only backwards. Don't lose my card. Oh, no, it's- Good-bye. Okay. Good luck, wherever you're going. Thanks. Les, I got him on tape. Talking pictures. And wait 'til you hear the talk. People are gonna eat him up. Now, tell me an affiliate between here and Vegas, 'cause I wanna get this on the cable. Hold your horses! Did you hear what I said about horses? I am trying to convey a sense of urgency. I want this on the air today. Okay, KLSG-TV. St. George, Utah. It looks about 60 miles. Okay, now pay attention. This is crucial. I need a camera crew to meet me at a place called Rim Rock Canyon. It's in Utah. Check the automobile club or something. When do you need 'em? They should leave right now, 'cause I don't know when I'm gonna get there or when he's gonna get there. And they should be prepared to camp out, 'cause I have a feeling this place does not have a Hilton Hotel. I mean, this is a place horses like, Les. And... Les, when Steele gets there, he's gonna turn Rising Star loose. What? $12 million worth of thoroughbred race horse loose in horse heaven. Think you got a story? Stick with the lunatic, Hallie. Tape everything. This is gold. It won't work. He doesn't want me around. Nobody wants you around. That's never stopped you before. You gotta find some way to talk to the guy. Make up a story. Look, Les, I'm tired. You get the crew and I'll talk to you later. Hey, what's going on? Did somebody rob a bank? I don't know for sure. I think somebody may have spotted that cereal cowboy. Hello! Hi. Listen, are you going to St. George? Unless they moved the road. You're wearin' out your welcome, lady. You can't go back to town. There's a cop convention there. What? I saw two patrol cars, two motorcycle cops, a county marshall and a sheriff... waitin' for you. You said nobody was gonna follow you. They didn't. An expert got me outta that hotel, I swear. Expert, huh? Hey! Wait a minute. Why? Do you want to film the capture? I am in as much trouble as you are. If I go back there, I'm gonna have to tell them everything I know, and I mean everything. If I don't, I'm gonna go tojail. It's called misprision of felony. That's from the legal department. You go ahead and tell 'em, 'cause I'm gonna be long gone. I can't. Don't you understand? I can't divulge sources and expect- Divulge sources? What are you doin'? And besides - Ohh! Wait a minute. Hey! Hold it What do you think you're doing? I'd have to tell them about Gus. I would. What are we gonna do? Get on the floor. Do it! Get on the floor. What? Easy, boy. - What are we doing? - You're gonna stay right there. When I go out the back, you're gonna count to 60. - Out the back? - When you get to 60, drive that the hell outta here. - The cops'll chase me. - You're crazy! Go to a place called Cisco Falls. Cisco Falls. There's a lake there at the bottom of some dry, red cliffs. - Where is Cisco Falls? - Find it! You found me. But, no. Listen. Wait a minute. You can't make it out there! There's at least a dozen cops. It's gonna be up to him. Okay now,Junkie, no excuses. Tendon's goin' down, you ain't wheezin' anymore. And goddamn, I've seen you run. Let's go. No, wait. Just- You can't- That's him.! Whoa! Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty. He's headin' south across Bundy's field. We can't follow him. Ten-four. Three-X-Seven. He's headin' for the dam. C'mon! C'mon! Do it! Do it! C'mon, boy! Go! Go! Go! All the way! Go! Go! C'mon! For chrissakes, man! Hey! Ah, geez! How did he get away? On a horse. On a horse. Find him. Bring them back here. Use the F.B.I. Use the state police. Use helicopters. Put out a reward, a large one. Get the Boy Scouts. Get the Marines. Where is he? Utah? Get the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Have them sing him in, but get him! Hello? Hello? Oh, you made it! You made it! Hey, there's some witch hazel in the cabinet over the sink. And there's, there's an old T-shirt by the bunk. I owe you one, buddy. Is he all right? Ahh! Easy. They didn't chase me. You were right. You should've seen yourself. You were great. You were. Were you surprised that I got here? No. Whoa. It was on the road map. I didn't even need to ask anybody or anything. Easy, boy. It'll be getting dark soon. How long does it take to drive to Rim Rock Canyon? Few days. - Only we ain't drivin'. - What? Cops'll be lookin' everywhere for that camper. Gonna have to leave it. And do what? Walk. I've seen him run. I saw him stumble, fall back and lose his stride, and pick himself up. You bet! He had nothin' left to give, but he found it... somewhere. And more drive and more soul than most people you'll ever know. And they're hangin'lights all over him. They're trottin'him around on stages with dancin'girls. Ta-ta-da-da-ta-ta.! They'd have him wearin' short pants and smokin' a cigar, if they thought it'd sell their damn junk! They're stickin'him full of needles.! Look at this tendon.! It's all filled up. He's shot all full of steroids. And it's just for looks. Makes the horse sterile. So even if they- God, this is so damn funny. Even if they wanted to pass on... some of them fine qualities, they couldn't. I could tape a little along the way. Nothing is gonna give away where we are. And maybe I could find someone to take it to the network the way I did today. Since you figure it's gonna be a long trip, that would give us- No, I'm not hungry. Thanks. That would give us maybe four or five days on news. And that way, once you set Rising Star free, the whole country's gonna be behind you. Then I just have to keep looking back over my shoulder. Ha! What's so funny? Do you wanna go to jail? No. How do you think this is gonna end up? Not on television. Okay. I, I, uh, respect your position. I do. I don't understand it, but I respect it. A lot of famous people hated publicity. Albert Schweitzer. Franco. Albert Schweitzer. Umm- How ya doin', partner? Get on your feet. Sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry. You didn't. What are we... doing? Goin' to sleep. I'm not sleepy. You weren't hungry, either. It's gonna be a long way, lady. A long way. Well, uh... where am I supposed to- Wherever you want. Where the hell are we? Donner Pass, for godsakes? I'm ready! I gotta get to a phone and warn Gus. Whew! When they spot that camper, they're gonna trace it right to him. W-W-What are you doing with that? This is expensive equipment, and I'm responsible for it. I'm certainly not gonna leave it there. We're walkin' with our feet. There's no escalators out here, or bellhops. Uh - Oh, no! No, no. He ain't carryin' it. I didn't ask. I ain't carryin' it, and you can't carry it. The hell I can't! I've carried this stuff a lot of times. Where? Up the escalator at Bloomingtons, or Bloomingbergs... or wherever the hell it is? Bloomingdales. And what the hell do you know about New York? Did you ever hear of the Madison Square Garden? No. They got a rodeo there, and it's a damn big thing, and I've been in it. Well, I've been to the rodeo... twice! Did you stay for the rattlesnake roundup? Yes. I stayed right to the end. I saw the whole thing. They don't have one. How you gonna round up a rattlesnake? Oh, God! I'm just trying to be pleasant. You get so worked up about everything. What have I got to be worked up about? I've only got a stole horse. Everybody but the Coast Guard's after me. I've got nothin' but miles of open country to cross. Now I'm carryin' a crazy woman around, wearing shoes from Bloomingbergs... that thinks she's seen a rattlesnake roundup. Go on, pick it up if you're takin' it, only it ain't goin' on my horse. Your horse! Ah! Here. Gimme those glasses, would ya? They're prescription. Well- You wait here with him 'til I get back, ya hear? No. If you're spotted, and you don't come back- Call your lawyer. Hello. Can I help ya? Howdy. Hello. Well, uh, I'm... broke down the road a piece, and I was just wonderin' if I could use your pho- I have a friend over in Mesquite. He's in a bit of trouble and he's waitin'for me, so I need to use a phone. I'd be obliged if I could use yours. Happy to pay you for it. We got a phone. C'mon in. Oh, great. Appre- Appreciate it. Phone's right there. Help yourself. Thank you. Hello! Gus, it's Sonny. Sonny! I gotta talk to ya, Gus. I can't talk long. Now, listen. Sonny! Gus, please, listen to me real careful. I'm in the kitchen! People are gonna come to you. Probably police. They're gonna ask you about the camper. I want you to tell 'em I stole it. Say it, Gus. Sonny stole the camper. My "Wild Blue Yonder''? I bought it in Elko. No, no, Gus. I bought it for you. Don't you remember? I'll buy you a nice new one next time I see ya. When the people come and ask about the camper, tell them, "Sonny stole the camper.'' Try to remember it. See ya, friend. I gotta go. Oh, uh- Partner, I'm much obliged for the use of that phone. Here. Five oughta cover it. Mr. Steele, I don't want your money. I saw you on the television, you and the horse. I'd be proud to help ya any way I can. Right now, looks like we oughta get you outta this county. How do you like it so far? Edwin. How's the day? Treatin' you good? Goin'all right. Got the whole world lookin' for that cowboy. I'll tell ya, he's probably up over that mountain by now. Wouldn't worry about it. I'd go take a nap on my porch. I wouldn't wanna find him anyway, 'cept for that reward. Fifty thousand bucks is a mound of cash. Wouldn't get my hopes up. All right, you're clear. Come on down. I don't know where you're headed, but Excalante's... just about six miles up over that mountain. The woman put together some stuff to keep you on your way. There's bread, cake, stew and coffee. I put a bottle of somethin' in there to keep your blood pumpin'. I sure do thank ya. Ain't no need to. Listen, not many people you trust $50,000 worth. Better get on over the mountain before it comes to me what I'm passin' up. C'mon. Oh, my God! Can we rest a little? Not yet. Where the hell are we? Well, you're not in jail. Look at it that way. I can't go any farther. Ah, sure you can. I've known people who go through stuff. I knew a guy misjudged a Brahma once. Put his ribs through his right lung. The guy could hardly breathe. He still got up and rode the rankest mare there. I will never understand... why you find that kind of behavior admirable. Gets you up the hill. I have to rest... for a minute. Hey, Steele? Sonny! Norman! How do you know "Norman''? I never divulge sources. Divulge sources! Here. Get up. Come on. You sure do your homework, don't you? Try to put your mind on somethin' else. Make things easier. Get it off your feet. You know the "Star Spangled Banner''? What? The national anthem. I know it's the national anthem. You mean, can I sing it? It's hard to sing. Yeah, it is. Why do you suppose that is? You know, that's a very interesting question. Why don't we sit down and discuss it? I used to be a psychology major before I went into journalism. "America the Beautiful.'' That's an easy tune to carry. Why don't we sit down and sing it together? Oh, spa- Oh, beautiful for spacious skies With amber waves of grain C'mon. C'mon, sing it. Oh, God! For purple mountain's majesty Above the fruited plain America A gold Lincoln Continental at 706 Elmine. 13-A-9. No warrant on the suspect. Ha- Halloween. Ha- Hall-ouise. What? Your name? Hallie? That's not your name. Alice. My name's Alice. My kid sister used to holler at me after school. She'd yell, "Hall-ice!'' So they call me Hallie. Alice Martin. That fits ya. I used to bite and pinch a lot too. I bet you did. It's mustangs. Mares. They smell the horse. You know what you need? A pair of proper shoes. Hey... where are we? Are we lost? Lost? No. Good night... Alice. Good night, Norman. We wanna be airborne in 30 minutes. If she's with Steele, then the network will know where they are. That's the news department, Mr. Sears. I don't think they're gonna want to give out that kind of information. Are you saying we spent $80 to $100 million dollars in TV time, and we can't get a simple piece of information? No, sir. I'm not saying that. You don't ask the news department. You ask the advertising department. They'll ask the news department. What are you doin' up? Nothing much. You had a hard day. Why don't you scrunch down in the bag? Oh, I wish it were that easy. I don't sleep. Ever? How old are ya? Not in front of, in front of people I don't know. Slept last night. The hell I did. Not in front of a stranger. What's the matter? You afraid of what you're gonna look like with your mouth open? You have a mean streak in you. No. No, I don't. I still pinch and bite. Okay. Good morning. I'm still here. There's, there's coffee from last night. It's probably cold. Probably is if it hasn't been heated. And there's cheese. Cheese? You're all bent. Are you sick? No, just bent. Well, here. Have some cheese. They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. I know. I'm the one that said it. Are you sure you're not hurt? No. Just some parts wake up faster than others. Broke parts take a little longer is all. I would've called a cab, left you a note. You know, "Call me, '" with my phone number. No. Actually I probably would've left my answering service number, and just stuck it right there on - What's the matter? I wanna know what's bothering you. It was just you and me last night. It's not gonna be on television. Is it? I don't know what you're talking about. The problem is that you get up slowly. I get up fast. It was the way I was raised. Hey, hey! I grew up gettin' up. We just got up and got to work. I was up before the sun ever hit your room. Well, then you get the getting-up medal. Aren't we supposed to be in a hurry? I mean, isn't that what you said? Good mornin', Alice. Good morning. You're right. We are in a hurry. But, let's say we lighten up a bit. I think that's a great idea... lighten up. We're gonna be traveling together a little while. Oh! There. All lightened up. Temperatures are dipping below freezing on the high plateau, and in the mountains the snow line is at 3,000 feet. On the national scene, the search for Rising Star and Sonny Steele... is concentrated in central Utah. KLSG switchboards have been jammed with phone calls- I didn't see any falls at Cisco Falls. Ain't any. Hell,you can name anything, anything. It's like those people who look up at the stars and see things: chickens, bulls, chariots and snakes and shit. What's this guy's name who's supposed to have a bell? Rion or Orion? There probably ain't no bell up there. Probably there was a falls here once. This whole land was under water millions of years ago. If you go slow, take your time and you look real close, you can find skeletons of these weird lookin' fishes in the hardpan... long, long gone. In fact, all these mountains- hell, everything, everything you can see- everything was under an ocean once. What are you smilin' at? I'm just enjoying the fact that you- That you know all that. It's interesting. Well, this country's where I live. Don't you know where the subways go? Not lately. Oh, yeah, you do. How'd you know to find me? There must've been 70, 80 reporters in that hotel room, but you were the one... that found me. I just had a few hunches and got a head start. You had more than that, Alice. You are good. Let's go. Here, gimme that stuff. Okay, I want ya to put your left foot right here. I, I don't know how to ride. C'mon. You're not gonna ride, you're just gonna be sittin' on him. I'm gonna be doin' the steering. I'm not interested in horses. They're too big. Oh. Hey, he ain't got a mean bone in his body. We're not gonna get anywhere with you in them spiky shoes. C'mon, put your foot up here. Oh, God! Okay, swing your right leg right on over. That's it. There you go. Here. Oh, it, uh- Sh-Should I pet him? Do what you want. He ain't no dog. Doyle Hicks. Go ahead. You're on the air. Is this Doyle? Turn down your radio. Yeah, well listen, I just wanna say that what Sonny Steele done... is wonderful news for the animals of this country, and that's all I have to say. ...if somebody's poisoning an animal, that person should try and stop it ifhe can. I would've done the same damn thing myself if I had the chance. Them Ampco people got no right to dope up a horse. What'cha got? No. You're not gonna throw this away, are you? What is it? Just notes. Can I see 'em? They're just my notes. What are these, in Russian? That's my handwriting. Read 'em. No. You got a secret? "I feel I'm seeing this country for the first time. "Not looking down from a jet 30,000 feet up, "but from the low angle... "of a special man who means to cross it on foot, "leading a thoroughbred stallion to a secret destination, "to a private goal, to a fairness that he intends to find in these valleys.'' I, I can't. They're just my notes. I'm embarrassed. Nice. It's hype. Could've fooled me. She ordered a camera crew to meet her at Rim Rock Canyon, I suppose to photograph - The ceremony. The sales figures again, exactly. In the three days since he took the horse, the office equipment has been as projected. The cereal. Cumulatively up 30 percent. And by closing time today, they'd emptied the shelves. Yes, Fitzgerald, what is it? Uh, well, sir, there's something here I think you should be aware of. Where'd you get that? There are about a half dozen kids selling them on the street. Now, that's not supposed to be there. Or we're not supposed to be here. You're lost? About a mile's worth, I'd say. We gotta get off this ridge. C'mon. Maybe, uh- Listen, maybe I could go down and get us some supplies. We've got enough supplies. Let's go. Ooh! Here, here! You okay? Are you all right? A-OK. You sure? Yeah. Let's go. Here. Maybe you oughta sit down. You don't understand the problem. Well, uh, lay down or somethin'. Here. And listen to you bitch about my boots? No, thank you. No, no. I'm beginnin' to like 'em. Here. Right here. C'mon, sit down. Oh, God, my back. Easy. Okay now, look. You just relax 'cause we're makin' good time. Don't worry. Hold on. Here. Oh. Little hair of the dog. Ooh! I feel better already. Yeah, well, don't put it away. Hey, why don't you get some rest? I'll go find us a place to cross the road. I won't be long. Ooh.! Hi there! What's your name? Louise. Oh.! Same as mine. You, uh, you taking care of this place all by yourself? Is your name really Louise? You bet! Your mom and dad here? My mom went to get butane. We're all out. You have a telephone? It's out too. Every time it snows up at Marysville, first thing, the phone goes out. Where's your car? Oh, I'm sort of camping out, and my car went on the blink. And I, uh, need to get a message to my boss. Are you gonna be near a phone later on, after you close up? We got a phone at home. I bet you could make a call for me, and get a message to him. Could you do that? How much do you charge to make a call? One dollar. That's fair. Listen, let me give you the phone number. When you get him on the phone, ask for Les Charles, and don't talk to anybody else. When you get him, tell him you're calling for me. For Louise. No! Yeah, Louise in Utah. I know what state it is. When you get him on the phone, tell him... I said call off the crew, and call off everything. I'll explain when I see him. Shouldn't I tell him about how your car broke down? No, no. Just the rest of it. - About the flu. - No, the crew. Call off the crew. Let me write it out for you. Her car broke down. Oh? Where's that, miss? Well, it, it- Well, it didn't really break down. It's just sort of acting- Now I have to call her boss about it. Say, aren't you, uh- You know, television. You've seen her. Last week I saw her. News. News commentator. This is too complicated, Louise. Thanks anyway. I'm just gonna get a few staples here. - Tell us your name, please. - Louise. Found us a spot. - How ya doin'? - Good as new. Serves ya right. Whew. There's a place we can cross the road about a mile south. Gotta honk on it, though. I wanna get there before dark. We're that... close? Yeah. Where we can spend the night inside for a change. C'mon. Isn't there some closer place where you guys... take horses to let 'em go? I just usually use the one, myself. It's so pretty here. If I were Rising Star, I'd love- We'll, you're not. C'mon. Do me a favor, will you, Alice? Don't go tryin'to think like a horse. I'll worry about him. You just take the notes. Ol'Clark Wembly had this place built, and us cowboys used to come on up here and use it for huntin' Now Clark Wembly... was really somethin' He had a voice that was just like runnin' molasses. It'd come over the P.A. system: "Sorry you lost, Sonny.'' And there I'd be,just lyin' in the dirt,just havin' been dumped on by some damn bull... just broke and busted. But ol' Clark's voice would come sailin' across there, and he'd say, "Give a big hand, folks. Glad you come. Better luck next time.'' God! Jesus! He was so terrific. He made me feel good. He made me feel like tryin' And he had a big bay mare outta Idaho. Ho, what an animal! That horse used to ju- just runnin'right off at the mouth. I enjoyed it. When we gonna get there? About midday. It's been a long haul. Somethin' bothering ya? What are you gonna do after? You're not gonna start with the questions now, are ya? When he's loose, chasing mares, do you just... do the same? What do you think? You're the one taking the notes. You're a... clever lady. What do you think's gonna happen? You say that like it's a bad word, "clever.'' No, I like you being smart. It's just sometimes you're so busy being clever, that I don't- When was the last time you were surprised? You. You were a surprise. I told them. Wha- Told? I, uh- I called the network and I told them that you were going to Rim Rock Canyon. And I asked them to meet me there with a camera crew. Oh. - And that's not all. - And now for the bad news? I lied when I said I was gonna go to jail. I wasn't in any trouble. Well. Well, well, well.! What do you know? Oh, Sonny! Please don't just walk away. Don't be like that. Hit me, yell at me. Slap me or something. Yell- I already slapped ya, first time we was alone together. Swear to God, I wouldn't do it now. Oh? Is that right? You a new person? It was three days ago. I didn't know you. I didn't understand what - Yeah. A lot can happen in three days. I didn't want to ruin anything for you, Sonny. I had a job to do, and I wanted a story. Well, you got it. You did it. Hey, how 'bout my... letter? Did you mail it, or is that gonna be on TV? Oh, please! - Well, what are you gonna do? - What I said. - Why can't you just take him to another place and let him go? - No. - Why? - I want him at that place. Everybody's done their thing. Ampco did what they had to do, you did what you had to do. Now I'm gonna do what I have to do. Sonny, you can't go there. You can't. They're gonna be there. The police may be there. I can't run forever. The way I look at it, we either all are goin' to heaven or we ain't. Besides, you wanna see the finish. Not like that. Well, be still. Let it finish. Oh, I don't want you to be hurt. I've been hurt. I still get up. Thanks for the worry. Do me a favor. Tomorrow? What? Don't take notes. Oh, Sonny, I'm so sorry. Better get off. How soon before we get there? We are there. Wait a minute! The camera crew... they're not here! Appears not. Well, Star, what do you think of the place? They, they - They must be at another entrance. Ain't no other entrance. Then hurry. Maybe they're lost. I doubt it. Hold on, boy. Where the hell are they? They're probably in Rim Rock Canyon. Isn't that where you told them to go? They'd be about 90 miles north. - This isn't- - This here is Silver Reef. Pretty, ain't it? You! You lied! I never said we were goin' to Rim Rock Canyon! You said it! Look out. Don't kick me with them boots! God...damn! Where in the hell is he, and what was this about a reward? I've been- I, I have been trying- We've been misinformed. When our own internal investigation revealed the truth, naturally we understood Mr. Steele's motivation. I don't think there's enough food to last another night. I don't think he's coming. It's occurred to me. Well, Star, you wanna say good-bye to the lady? Hey, boy. Swing your tail. Excuse us, will ya? Okay. Remember, they're just horses, the same as you... only they never been broke. But they ain't won no championships neither. So when you cross that stallion and he wants to fight, you remember you got the blood on your side. You can take him! Is he just gonna go, just like that? You bet. I thought you guys were pals. We are. Make somethin' outta yourself now. Yeah, when I see you, Les. About 9:00. Okay. Bye, bye. There's your bus. Looks like it's on time. Oh? Good. Mmm. How do you feel? I feel good. Maybe not as good as him, but good. What'd they say? They're full of congratulations. Can't wait to get the story, - especially now that Ampco has reversed its position. - Yeah, I'll bet. They have me going to Paris next to cover the elections. Well, no kiddin'? That'll be interestin'. More coffee? No, not for me, thanks. Want any? Yes, please. Just a little somethin' for the road. Ho, ho, ho! Oh, careful. Tell me, Norman. Did you think it was gonna be this tough to get rid of a pain in the ass like me? Ma'am, I had no idea. All aboard the bus.! Cedar City, Richfield, Utah, and Denver, Colorado. Hi. Did you get two red suitcases? Um, that story you're gonna tell? It would be nice if you didn't mention where it was we let him go. Silver Reef? Yeah. It'd be nice if you didn't divulge that source. I don't know. Leave out a name like that? What are you gonna do tomorrow, Sonny? Oh, I'm gonna... get movin' on. Find me somethin' simple. Hard maybe, but plain and quiet. Any bags, ma'am? Uh, no. Hey! I keep wantin' to thank ya, but then I keep wonderin' what for. I know. I know. Me too. Maybe it's for how I'm gonna feel whenever I see you on television. Guess I'm gonna have to get me a TV. So- All aboard, ma'am. So long, Alice. So long, Norm. Have a safe trip back, now. All charges have been dropped, and according to one company source, the Ampco art department is hard at work designing a new logo. Camera three. As to the whereabouts of Rising Star, nothing further is known. So ends the bizarre saga of horse racing's most honored stallion... and the man who set him free. Except for one note of thanks from this reporter to Mr. Steele... for his cooperation in bringing this story to you. This is Hallie Martin in New York saying good night. At a time when the world Seems to be spinnin' Hopelessly out of control There's deceivers and believers And old in-betweeners That seemed had no place to go But it's the same ol'song It's right and it's wrong And livin'is just somethin' that I do And with no place to hide I looked in your eyes And I found myself in you I looked to the stars Tried all of the bars And I'd nearly gone up in smoke Now my hand's on the wheel Of somethin'that's real And I feel like I'm goin'home And I feel like I'm goin'home
