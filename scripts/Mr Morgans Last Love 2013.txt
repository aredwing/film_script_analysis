I am not leaving her. I'm not leaving her. (AUDIBLY STRUGGLING) Let me go! Don't touch her! Don't you dare touch her! (MAN SPEAKING FIRMLY IN FRENCH) Damn! (DISTANT DOG BARKS; DISTANT INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (TELEPHONE RINGS) (RING) (RING) (RING) (DISTANT TELEPHONE RINGS) (RING) (DOORBELL RINGS) (COUGHS) - MADAME DUNE: Monsieur Morgan! - Damn! Monsieur Morgan?! Madame Dune? What are you doing here? What do you mean? It's Tuesday. It's Wednesday, monsieur. Wednesday? Are you sure? Yes, monsieur. Would you like me to make you some breakfast, monsieur? No, thank you. How about some lunch later? No, thank you. (TELEPHONE RINGS) I'm going out to lunch. - But it's Wednesday, monsieur. - (TELEPHONE RINGS) Your lunch with Madame Lry is on Thursdays. - Unless you changed it? - Yeah. No. But... don't answer that! Oui, bonjour? Oui, madame Karen, il est l. CLERK: 4,50, monsieur. - 4, 50. - Merci. - Merci vous. - Bonne journe. Au revoir. Monsieur? Yes, I would like a ham and cheese baguette to go, with the pickle on the side. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Jambon, that one. Take the pickles off. And put the pickles on the side. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Like always, monsieur? No pickles, and water? Thank you. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Thank you. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Thank you... mademoiselle. - Bye. - Bye. Now speak after me: J'ai faim. Je t'aime. Can I eat my lunch now? You're never going to learn the language this way, chri. I don't have to. I have you. But what if... What if we enjoy "la dejeuner"? Le djeuner. Le djeuner. S'il vous plait? S'il te plait. S'il te plait. MATTHEW: Pardon. Pardon. (SPEAKING FRENCH SHARPLY) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Yeah, sorry, sorry. (SPEAKING FRENCH) You okay? Yes, thank you. Pardon. Those steps are tricky when they're wet. They can be. Thank you, you're very kind. De rien, monsieur. Would you maybe like me to walk you home? Do you live near here? Thank you, that... that's not really necessary. I really don't mind. I've got time. See now? I am now officially Girl Scout material. Pardon? Sorry, uh... um... it's not far. This is my place. You've been very kind. May I buy you a cup of coffee? I'm sorry, but I can't. I've got to go to class. But thank you very much for the invitation. - You're a student? - No, I'm a teacher. Really? So am I! Really? What do you teach? Well so was I. Philosophy. And you? Cha cha. Au revoir. Good-bye. Thank you. De rien. (TELEPHONE RINGS) - MILES: Susan? - Susan? It's 7 a.m. Why would Susan call you at 7 a.m.? Isn't she there? Hi, Dad. Is everything alright? - Yeah. - Where is Susan? Yeah. She's just... visiting her mom for a couple of days. Then why are you whispering? Kyle's here. He had a bad dream. Yeah, well, I was just checking in. How is everyone? We're fine. Did you buy your tickets yet? No... um, I need to talk to you about that. We might not be able to come over this year. Susan might have other plans. Oh, I see. What other plans? Hang on. KYLE: Hello, Grandpa. Hello, Kyle, how are you? - Not bad. And you? - Not so bad myself. Mom said we're not gonna see you this summer. Uh, listen, Kyle, um... I-I gotta go. Will you tell your father we'll talk another time? Okay. (CALL ENDS ABRUPTLY) (TRAFFIC SOUNDS) Damn. She is waiting, Monsieur Morgan. - For quite a while, I might add. - Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late, Colette. I lost track of all time. You are forgived. You are forgiven. Ah, yes. Thank you. - Voici. - Merci. No need for a bad... how would you say mauvaise conscience? - Conscience? - Conscience. Yes! So it's the same, only you say it differently. Isn't that I think strange? We say science and you say science. We say conscience and you say... - Conscience. - Conscience. It's a mystery, non? I'm so fond of our little lessons, Matthew. I hope you will never get tired of my terrible accent. (MAN SPEAKING FRENCH) Will you order maybe in French? Have some practice? Not if you're hungry. (CHUCKLES) Okay. All right, I will order. The same like always? Ouais. Y-yes. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) (AMERICAN ACCENT) Non, merci. Far away from home, eh? Actually, this is my home. Paris, that is. Really. What's your area? - St. Germain. - I meant as a collector. No, I'm... I'm not actually a collector. No. I'm thinking about it, though. Well, let me tell you something. And don't get me wrong. But... small goals. That's what you have to do. Keep your expectations low. To get started at your age, well... I've been doing this for 35 years and I tell you, I have yet to scratch the surface. Really? I thought stamp collecting was for... Trust me. It's just starting to get interesting. I took on Scandinavia in the '70s, but after a few years I realized there was no way I was gonna get together a decent collection in one lifetime. So... I narrowed it down. - To what? - Sweden. Now I'm starting to look at Iceland. Interesting island. Not a lot of mail. If you want my advice: Think Eastern Europe. Romania is down that way to your left. MAN: Pardon! Hello! Well! What a surprise. Nice to see you again. Yeah. I am getting off here... Me too, me too. Where you going? Home, I'm going home. And I really don't have to say everything twice. I'm afraid you've missed your stop. This is a bit far from your home. Unless you really like to walk. I do, but... to tell you the truth, I didn't really want to get off until I said hello to you. Really? So... hello again. Hello. How are you? I'm very well, thank you. I'll get the next one back. You don't have to wait with me, you know. My name is Pauline. Laubie. Et vous? Matthew. Matthew Morgan. Happy to do your acquaintance, Matthew Morgan. - Make your acquaintance. - Yeah. No. It's make your acquaintance, not do your acquaintance. Oh, okay. I never understand the difference between the two. Yeah, it's really quite... confusing. Maybe if you're not too busy you could come by my school some time. I mean, only of course if you have time... I have more time than I need. You could take a lesson. First one is free. Oh, great. Here. This is my school. I work Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. I don't work Thursday. But you can come anytime. Well, thank you. Your bus is here. Thank you. (WATER RUNNING) (WATER STOPS) There are 24 different kinds of birds on Romanian stamps... and that's just between 1964 and 1994. Is that a lot? I have no idea. Matthew! I am not late, am I? No. Not at all. No, no. This is very exciting. Um, maybe this isn't such a great idea, Colette. What do you mean? I won't be able to understand the instructions, and the clothes. Oh no, no, no. No excuses this time, Matthew. You brought me here, now we will go in. I will translate. I don't know anything about dancing. I don't dance. I never did dance, I... (MUSIC PLAYING) (VOCALISTS SINGING IN SPANISH) (MUSIC ENDS) - (APPLAUSE) - Merci. (SPEAKING FRENCH) - Do you know each other? - Sort of. Deux, trois, cha-cha-cha, et deux, trois, cha-cha-cha. (CONTINUES INSTRUCTIONS IN FRENCH) Et bien voil! (MUSIC PLAYING) (VOCALISTS SINGING IN SPANISH) (SPEAKING SOFTLY IN FRENCH) (PAULINE SPEAKING FRENCH) (MUSIC ENDS) - I hope you enjoyed your lesson. - Very much, thank you. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Merci. Me too. Matthew teaches me. We don't want to keep you. Come back soon. Thank you. (PAULINE INSTRUCTING IN FRENCH) Monsieur. Excusez-moi, mais vous arrivez trop tard. I'm sorry? You are too late. The "Jolly 70s" class started half an hour ago. MATTHEW: Oh, I'm not here for the class. I'm here to see Pauline. Matthew! (SPEAKING FRENCH) Hi, I'm sorry. I didn't want to interrupt. That's okay. Do you want to join us? Oh no, I don't think so. I've got half an hour left. You want to come and watch? Okay. (COUNTRY/WESTERN SONG BEGINS) Cinq, six, cinq, six, sept, huit. (MUSIC CONTINUING) (MUSIC CONTINUING) (SONG ENDS) (SCATTERED APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER) Bravo! C'tait trs bien! You're not obliged to have lunch with me, Pauline. I know. But you're obliged to have lunch with me, Mr. Morgan! You wait for me here, I'll be right back. I've got a surprise for you. (CHILD COUNTING IN FRENCH) (GIRLS LAUGHING) Matthew! This will be our bench. You got us hot dogs? I thought maybe you were homesick. Careful! Ohh! What a klutz I am. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have made you eat out here. I like it here. Anyway, I could use a little chaos in my life. - I'm afraid it's ruined. - That's okay. So you think I'm chaotic? Unpredictable. Well, I hope it didn't ruin your appetite. Absolutely not. You shaved your beard. Yeah. Don't you like it? I do. But I liked your beard. It reminded me of my father. Well, I hope you like your father. I did. He's dead. Oh, I'm sorry. - It was a long time ago. - I didn't realize that. Your hair. What? It's so like my wife's hair. Well, I hope you like your wife. I did. She's dead. Matthew. That's not funny. I'm not kidding. She died. Three years, two months and 11 days ago. You want to talk about it? No. Oh, shit. (BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH) Matthew, this is Lucien. Lucien, this is Matthew. I'm really glad you came by. I'll see you soon, okay? Yeah. - Bye, Matthew. - Bye. I'm early. You certainly are. Is it okay? Uh... come in. This is a very nice apartment. My wife found it for us. Have you read all those books? I'm afraid so. What are you doing with them? I'm selling them. I don't want them anymore. You must have someone who wants them, no? No, I don't. You have a car? I wish you'd sound a little less surprised, but yes, I do. I'm sorry, Matthew, but I did meet you on the bus. Yes. Imagine that. Thank you. MATTHEW: We have a reservation. (MAN SPEAKING FRENCH) Morgan. PAULINE: Merci. Pauline, come in here. We'll take this table. MATRE D': Monsieur... MATTHEW: Mademoiselle... ...is perfect, thank you! And we'll have two glasses of your best champagne, s'il te plait. Merci. S'il vous plait. S'il vous plait. S'il vous plait. I was a professor. At Princeton. Did you ever attend university? No. Maybe I would have liked it, I don't know. It's too late now anyway. It's never too late to learn something, Pauline. My mother always complained that I didn't have any ambition. She wanted me to become a real dancer. You are a real dancer. - No, I'm not. - Yeah. Pas du tout. You know when you love something so much you start to hate it? Yes. Is that what happened to you and your books? I stopped looking at my books when I stopped loving life. Why did you stop loving life? Well, you don't love life itself. You love, uh, places, animals, people, memories, food, literature, music. And sometimes you meet someone... who requires all the love you have to give. And if you lose that someone, you think everything else is gonna stop too. But everything else just keeps on going. Giraudoux said, you can miss a single being, even though you are surrounded by countless others. Those people are like... like extras. They cloud your vision, they're a meaningless crowd. They... They're an unwelcome distraction. So you seek oblivion in solitude. But solitude only makes you wither. So I'm an unwelcome distraction. I'm a cloud? You are the only part of my life I haven't figured out yet. Mademoiselle. Merci. Monsieur. Merci. Pauline, I can't let you row me. I can row! No, no, I can't let a woman row me in a boat. Matthew. Do I have to remind you that we live in the 21st century? (GEESE HONKING) PAULINE: Okay, how about this one: "There's a crack in everything." BOTH: "That's how the light gets in." MATTHEW: See, I told you. I still think you're wrong, Matthew. I don't think you have everything in your life figured out. Why would you think that? Huh? Tell me. I think the day we figure out everything about our lives is the day we die. (DISTANT THUNDER RUMBLES) (STARTER MOTOR WHIRRS) MAN: Encore! (STARTER MOTOR WHIRRS) One more time. (MAN SPEAKING FRENCH) You'll be late for your appointment, Pauline. You'd better take a taxi. Jerome can give me a ride. That's great. You think he's cute? In a George Hamilton sort of way, yeah. Who's George Hamilton? Okay, someone will be there in half an hour. Merci. You gonna be okay? - I'll call you tonight. - Absolutely, now go. Okay. I'm an old fool, darling. Just an old fool. Are you okay? Yeah. No. I don't know. Do you want to go home? No. Do you? I am home. I want to die here, Matt. I have a better idea. What? Let's live here forever. Matthew? Is something the matter? No, no, no, not at all. I have to tell you something. That makes two of us. I have something to tell you too. I'm leaving town. My cousin's husband died, and she has a big house and is all alone now, and... she asked me to come live with her. I'm very sorry, Matthew, but I said yes. That's wonderful, Colette. I'm happy for you. I think I'm going home too. (KNOCK ON DOOR) MADAME DUNE: Monsieur Morgan? Monsieur Morgan! PAULINE: Hi. MATTHEW: Hi. What happened, Matthew? I botched an attempt to self-medicate. What does that mean? It means I took too many sleeping pills. Or too few. Depends on how you want to look at it. Can I ask you why you did that? Because I met you. Don't get me wrong. It's not your fault, Pauline. But you helped me realize... I was just biding my time. Do you think they have a Coke anywhere in this hospital? Yeah, I'll get you one. And when I come back I'll tell you about a decision I made. Don't go now. Dad. Miles. Pauline, this is my son, Miles. Miles, this is Pauline. Hi. It's nice to meet you. I'm gonna go get you that Coke. Okay, thanks. How you feeling? I'm feeling fine. Jesus, Dad. What were you trying to do? Punish us? Actually, I wasn't thinking about you. Imagine my surprise. You shouldn't have come all this way just because I failed at suicide. Can we at least acknowledge that this is awkward? First they tell me you almost died, and then I come here and find you in the arms of some woman not even close to half your age that I know nothing about. There's nothing awkward about Pauline. - I brought you one too. - Thank you, but no thanks. I'm gonna go outside and see if I can find Karen. MATTHEW: Karen's here too? Thank you. You have a son? I have a son and a daughter. You were going to tell me about a decision you made. It can wait. MILES: Just out front. I'll see you. Mm-hmm. Good. Okay. What are you doing with my dad? I'm not doing anything with him. I'm his friend. He hasn't told me a word about you. He hasn't told me a word about you either. Do you really think that I don't know what's going on? What's going on? My father is not some helpless old man to be taken advantage of. Your father tried to kill himself, Miles. Maybe you want to think about that before you try and figure me out. You make friends fast. Mm-hmm. Who was that? Our future stepmother, for all I know. No, really, who was it? No, really, ask Dad. (KAREN SIGHS) An overdose is not my favorite excuse for coming to Paris, but I do appreciate the effort. Hello, Karen. How you doing, Dad? And what are you doing with that French bimbo? The next time you call her that will be the last time we speak. You mean that, don't you? Jesus, Karen, what are you doing? This is a hospital. A European hospital. You need to grow up, little brother. (SPEAKING SHARPLY IN FRENCH) I'm sorry, what did you say? You want me to take a wild guess? KAREN: No! That could hurt somebody. Okay, okay. We want you to come home, Dad. All right, okay. She wants you to come home. Damn. - KAREN: Isn't that the same thing? - MILES: I guess. KAREN: In your mind... (INDISTINCT REMARK) - I can't stay here. - Me neither. - Let's get a hotel. - Yeah. I want my own room. Yeah, I want you to have your own room. Hello? So what's the plan? I'm going to soak in my tub, then I'm going to call my significant other, then I'm going shopping, I swear to God. What about Dad? We can see him tomorrow. You heard the nurse, he needs his rest. I thought you didn't speak French. Of course I do, don't you? Bon jour. CLERK: D'accord, c'est possible. - I got mine. - Yeah. Don't dwell. I'll see you later. (DISTANT DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) So you have a... you have a key to this place? Matthew asked me to get some things for him. What? You seem to know your way around here pretty well. It is not heart surgery. Brain surgery. I just want what's best for my father. And what do you think that is? I, uh... I think he needs his family now. I think you're right. You're gonna stay here? In case Matthew needs to reach you? No. We're at the Hotel Senat, down the street. I was gonna bring him this. You might as well take it to him. It's E. E. Cummings. He's into that. You know, if I had a father like Matthew, I would be very happy... Why, 'cause he's such a shining example of fatherhood? ...that he's still alive. Au revoir, Miles. What are you doing here, Pauline? I'm having dinner with you. You know the day I met you on the bus? I felt like I knew you. It felt like I did. And I thought... And you thought what? I thought you didn't have anyone. You know, like I don't have anyone. And... I thought maybe I'd been looking in all the wrong places. And maybe you and I could be... family. Pauline... But it turns out you have a whole... family waiting for you back in America. I'm a lousy father. Why do you say that? Joan wanted kids. I just wanted her. So, I wanted her to be happy, and it seemed like a good reason at the time. They say you do, but I never grew into being a father. I don't know how Joan did it. She had so much love to give. I mean the kids would make a mistake or hurt themselves, I'd go crazy. But Joan would just come out, pick them up, dust them off, dry their tears and send them off again. All I knew was... I didn't want to be like my father. And I ended up just like him. Your children and grandchildren don't want you to die, Matthew. And I don't want you to die. So you're outnumbered. Have a rain check. Take a rain check. They'll never forgive me. Please, Matt. Do this for me. I'm done. I want to go home. Quelle heure est-il? Il est une heure. (MILES CONTINUES PRACTICING FRENCH) Exactly the look I was going for. Come on, let's get on the same page about Dad. You freak me out. Seriously, Dad. Why don't you just move back home? - We can't look after you here. - I don't need looking after. ...and for the money that you'll get for the house and for the apartment, you can live in a palace in Chicago. Or Maine. I'm not moving to Maine. Well, you can move wherever you want. I have a better idea. I stay right here. Well, let's at least sell St. Malo. I'm not selling your mother's house, and I am not having this discussion with you. Yes, you are, because half of that house is ours, and we get a say in this too. Fine. I'll buy you out. Jesus, Dad, you really think this is about the fucking money? You really think this is what Mom would want? Think she'd want you to die here, alone, lonely and miserable? I am not lonely, and I am not miserable. And if you'll excuse me, there is someplace I have to be. Dad, we have to talk about this. No, we don't. (CELLPHONE RINGS) (KAREN GROANS) Oh, well, this can't be good. What are you doing awake? Is the house on fire? It better be, 'cause you are in deep shit if it's not. I'm serious. Has your IQ dropped dramatically since I've left? (COUNTRY/WESTERN MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC CONTINUING) MATTHEW: Oh, that one! (MUSIC CONTINUING) I'm gonna be home in about 14 hours. You're just going to have to wing it until then, okay? Yeah, but they're your genes, too. Look, I'm gonna go now. I'm hanging up! Bye. Well, honey, you are on your own. I have to go stop my own dysfunctional family from killing each other. What time is your flight tomorrow? I think I'm going to stick around for a few days. Oh yeah? What about Susan and Kyle? Well, um, I talked to Susan this morning. - They'll survive without me. - Yeah, I bet they will. What's that supposed to mean? How long are you gonna keep this up? Keep what up? Susan left you five weeks ago, Miles. How do you know about that? 'Cause she told me, you idiot. You gonna be okay? Of course I will. If not, I can always talk to Dad, right? You're hysterical. Look, I really do have to go or I am gonna miss my flight, and then Laura will miss her play, and then Ray might hurt her. Or she won't miss it, and then she might hurt him, but either way, they're gonna end up behind bars, and, man, after all this shopping, I am fresh out of bail money. Thank you. I will call you... and then we'll talk, okay? You are my favorite brother. I'm your only brother. Details. Charles de Gaulle, s'il vous plait. So you and my dad are not... No, we're not. Then I don't get it. What don't you get? Why do you hang out with my dad? Matt needs someone to take care of him. Yeah, I can imagine why he's letting you do it. Why are you doing it? I'm good at it. So how good are you at, uh, taking care of yourself? Hmm? Wait, let me guess. You suck at it, right? - Okay, now it's my turn. - For what? Asking questions you don't like to answer. Fair enough. Why are you so angry? My wife is pregnant. And that makes you angry? It's not mine. But that's not why I'm angry. Matt thinks you're angry at him. And what exactly makes you an authority on the subject? I've seen the way he looks at you when you leave the room. What are you doing tonight? Reservation for Laubie. Or Morgan? - MATRE D': Oh, yes. - Yes? Hello. Thank you. Merci. What are you doing here? Pauline asked me to dinner. Oh. - What are you doing here? - I asked her to dinner. Oh. Is Karen coming too? No. She had to go home. Family crisis. What about you? My flight is tomorrow. I'm sure Susan and Kyle can't wait to have you back. I'm having the, uh, foie gras. - How about you? - MATRE D': Mademoiselle. Oh, good evening. Bonsoir. - MATTHEW: You look very beautiful. - Merci. MATTHEW: Sit down, please. Merci. This is a very nice restaurant. It is, yeah. Have you been here before? PAULINE: No. MILES: I should go. Please stay. I want you to. Well, if he wants to leave... You want him to stay too, don't you? MATTHEW: Of course. Say, Pauline, have you ever been to St. Malo? No. But, you know, I've always wanted to go. I hear it's really beautiful. Did Karen put you up to this? I can think for myself, Dad. I've already had this discussion with her, and I don't want it again with you. Of course. Just do what you do best. Shut everyone up. What's in St. Malo? Nothing, we... we had a house there. We have a house there. It was my mother's favorite place in the world. It was also the only thing that we could all ever agree on. I told you, you'll get the money. I told you, it's not about that! PAULINE: Please, can we try to... You know, you're not the only one with feelings about that house. But you have no consideration for anyone but yourself. I used to think that when Mom was still alive... Don't bring your mother into this! She's got nothing to do with it! She has everything to do with this! If you're gonna spend the rest of your life being angry with me, that's your decision. But I am not selling Joan's house to a stranger, and that is final! It's our house, and I don't even want you to sell it. - But if Mom was here... - Well, she's not here! She's gone! And I would give anything to take her place. Anything. But I can't. She died, and I'm still here. Have you any idea what that leaves me with? What does that leave you with? It leaves me with absolutely nothing, Miles. (SPEAKING FRENCH) All right, I'm leaving. No, no, it's okay, I'll leave. Forget it. Enjoy your dinner. Where's your manners? Pauline invited you to dinner. Watch your own manners, Dad. Goddamn it, Miles, what do you want from me? I want you to stop acting like you're the only one who lost her. Why are you angry now?! Miles! Attends! - Listen, I'm sorry! - Hey! Nobody asked you to fix this, you hear me? You cannot fix it. You're not that good. Just go away. PAULINE: Miles! KYLE: Are you sure? Very sure. - So, like, totally? - Yeah. - How sure? - Dead sure. - Sounds good. - Yeah. See you soon, Dad. - Sooner than you think. - Okay. Good night. Okay. Good night. WOMAN: Monsieur? Yes, I would like one of those ham and cheese sandwiches. Could you please take off the pickles? Yes, thanks. How much is that? (LANGUID GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING) MAN: May I help you? Where's Pauline? She's not here. She called in sick today. (DOORBELL BUZZES) Pauline? I tried drinking for a while. It didn't work with me at all. You could use some chairs. I'll get you some chairs. I'm sorry about last night. You shouldn't get caught in the middle like this. I got my own problems. I got problems! Do you understand? Yeah. I-I know. I'm sorry. I... I'm really very sorry. It's just that... What is it, Matthew? You... are the crack... in my world. Do you want to keep the hangers? No. There are few things more depressing than empty coat hangers. What shall we put this in? Uh... I don't... Do you have big garbage bags or... or suitcases? Suitcases. CLERK: Et les valises? Do you need the suitcases? No. I don't need them anymore. No. So whatever happened to George Hamilton? Who? Jerome. The garcon. (PAULINE CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Did you ever see him again? No. Why not? He couldn't take his eyes off you. Well, you know what men are like. - No, what are they like? - They're all the same. The way they stare at your tits and pretend not to. Actually, I was hoping I wasn't like that. You're different. That's why I love being with you. You stare at me for no reason. Should I call the police, monsieur? I'm sure that's not necessary. Uh... I'm gonna wait for him. You want to go in? Do you? (DISTANT DOG BARKS; DISTANT CHILD SPEAKS) (SOFT SOB) (SEABIRDS CAWING) (SOBBING SOFTLY) (SEABIRD CAWS LOUDLY) (CLATTERING SOUNDS) I hope you're hungry. Anything I can do? Yeah, you could, uh, pick these beans for me. I need a handful of thyme. And open that bottle and pour us a glass. You were wrong about me, you know. Yeah? How? I can think of lots of reasons to stare at you. Really. I can think of about ten of them right now off the top of my head. Okay. - You really want to know? - I really want to know. Okay, um... You're beautiful. Obviously, you're smart. And I can always tell when you're sad because you hide behind your defiance when you are. When you're happy, all of you is happy, even your hair. You don't have a mean bone in your body, and I thought they didn't make them like that anymore. You're funny. When you listen, you look interested. You're kind. And you wear your heart on your sleeve, which can be terribly intimidating. (DISTANT SEABIRD CAWS) And you remind me of Joan. I want you to have the house, Pauline. What? I want to give you this house. And I will make sure that you'll always have enough money to maintain it. Will you do that for me? No, Matthew. This house belongs to your family. I thought you're my family now. What's wrong, Pauline? I don't understand you. I thought I did, but I-I don't. You have everything that I want, and you don't seem to care. I do care. Then why do you push them away like you do? They're your children. They came here because they're worried about you. You think they love me because of the rules? I think they love you because you're their father. You have this fantasy in your head about the perfect family that you never got to have. Well, I'm telling you, it doesn't exist. You're still here, Matthew. If you want things to be different, you can still change them. It's not too late for that. Believe me, all I am to them is the man who took their mother away from them. What do you mean? The kids wanted her to go home. She wanted to stay in Paris, so I let her. I thought it might help her get well. But the cancer got worse and the treatment tortured her. I just... didn't want to see her suffer anymore. I... I didn't want her to be in pain anymore. Maybe I didn't want to be in pain anymore. She didn't want me to tell the kids. She... she wanted to go home, give up the fight and die in peace. But if she saw the kids, she wouldn't be able to do that. Especially Miles, you know. He would never have let her. She made me promise. And I... I did. You never told them? Well, it was my mistake. Not hers. Hi. - Where's my father? - He's fine. I didn't ask you how he is, I asked where he is. Wait, Pauline. I'm sorry. I was worried. Um... would you like to come in? Matthew doesn't know I'm here. Where is he? I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to tell you that. You don't think I have a right to know? No. My father wants to die. And who am I to stop him, right? He didn't want me here when Mom was dying, he certainly doesn't want me here now. Miles, I want to tell you something. I think it's okay if I do. Matt... I'm dying. You're not dying. It wasn't supposed to be like this. It wasn't supposed to be like this. What would you have done if you'd been there? Probably exactly what she was afraid I'd do. That's her. Her last good summer. She's very beautiful. Who is that? That's my son, Kyle. What? What? I like it that you carry a picture in your wallet and not in your phone, like everyone else. It's nice. It's old-fashioned. Oh, boy. I like it. Yeah, well, you're easy to impress. I'm a pushover. Your son is gorgeous. Yep, he's the real thing. MATTHEW: I need to go to Paris. Yeah, there's only one Paris in France, right? Ouais. We have a Paris in Texas. We have one in Illinois. We have one in Tennessee, New York, Iowa, Ohio, Maine, Wisconsin, Kentucky. We have one in Michigan, Arkansas and Idaho. And those are only the ones I know. I'm pretty sure there's one in Canada too. What time is it? I gotta go. Let me go with you. No. - Pauline. - Yes. (TAPPING AT DOOR) Dad. If you hurt her, I will kill you. I don't care that you're my son. I will kill you. Monsieur Morgan, there you are. Oh, Madame Dune. I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting you. I brought you your groceries. I will cook you a nice lunch, yes? Thank you very much, but I will prepare my own lunch today, but thank you. But, monsieur... Thank you... for everything. (DOORBELL RINGS) Hi. I'm having lunch. Listen, Dad... You're a married man, for Christ's sakes! How dare you do this to Susan and Kyle? How dare you do this to Pauline? Did you...? Does she know you have a wife and kid? No, I didn't. Yeah, she does. And my marriage is over. What? Susan filed for divorce. Why? What happened? What did you do? I didn't do anything. Can you imagine it could possibly not be my fault? She left me, Dad. When? Five weeks ago. She met someone else. And that's it. And I didn't tell you 'cause Mom never liked Susan in the first place, and you never thought I was cut out for the long haul, and I don't particularly enjoy watching you wallow in self-righteousness. Marriage is hard work. You think I didn't work hard enough at this? You have to be willing to make sacrifices. Ah. Yeah. What sacrifices did you make, exactly? So Kyle's gonna come live with me. What about the hospital? I'll have to get another job. But I'm gonna make it work. Will this be in Kyle's best interest? That's what he wants. He needs me, so I'm gonna make damn sure I'll be there, so he doesn't make the same mistakes that I did. I was there. I taught you things, but that didn't stop you... Of course you did, Dad. All my life you taught me what to think and what to read, and what to believe in. But I did not need a teacher. I needed a father! You know, you're gonna have to stop blaming me for everything that goes wrong in your life! All I ever wanted for you was to go out in the world, chase your dreams, find adventure, fall in love, take risks! That's all I wanted for you! Why didn't you ever tell me that? Because I didn't think I had to! Dad, come on! Because I didn't know how... All I ever heard from you is what I did wrong. Because I didn't know how to tell you... that I didn't want you to become like me. Dad, I adored you. Blind faith. No, it's that... you're wrong. I knew that Mom would never love anyone like she loved you who wasn't worth it. You know, to this day... I don't know why your mother picked me. Matthew? Matthew? Dad, Pauline told me. About Mom. I'm glad she did. I didn't stop her. Well, she didn't want you to. I should have stopped her. You knew Mom. You couldn't have. If you want to blame someone, Miles, blame me. I should have told you. I don't blame anyone, Dad. I just wish I could have said good-bye to her. I wanted to say good-bye. I was there. I didn't know how. Well. Maybe we can find another way. Maybe. Remember how she used to light up a room? Like the sun. Pauline does that. Yeah. Don't let her get away. I won't. - Don't let her run away. - I won't. Don't let anybody or anything get in your way. - Dad. - What? - Stop it. - Okay. Would you do me a favor? Would you tell Pauline... Tell her.. Tell her... I figured it out. Figured what out? She'll know. You're not left with nothing. You know that, don't you? I do. Okay. Bye. I miss you, Matthew. I miss you, too. He left you St. Malo. I told him I didn't want it. Well, he always had a better idea. Listen... I have to go see my son. But, uh, I'll be back. Okay. I'll come back for you, Pauline. Okay. Ready? FEMALE VOCALIST: Tell me how you've been And tell me what you've seen And tell me that you'd love to see me, too 'Cause my heart is full of no blood And my cup is full of no love I couldn't take another sip Even if I wanted But it's not too late Mmm, mmm, mmm It's not too late For love My lungs are out of air And yours are holding smoke And it's been like that now For so long And I've seen people try to change And I know it isn't easy But nothing worth the time ever really is And it's not too late Mmm, mmm, mmm It's not too late For love For love For love For love (COUNTRY/WESTERN MUSIC PLAYING) MALE VOCALIST: I'm walkin' back to baby's arms I been missin' all her charms I'm gonna reach her by today I hope that I can find my way Over valleys and the hills Cross the ocean to be near I keep a-walkin' back away In her arms is where I stay Oh, there's been Too many teardrops From the start Another night All alone And I couldn't bear to be apart I'm walkin' back to baby's arms I been missin' all her charms I wanna reach her by today I hope that I can find my way And I don't care to be alone I'm walkin' back to baby's home And I really miss her charms I'm walkin' back to baby's arms
