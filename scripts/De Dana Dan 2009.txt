But he doesn't know you, what's the problem? But, that other foolalong with him, knows me. He filed a case against me for bounced cheques. I know, when that moustached man arrives tell him. That I had to leave for an urgent meeting. Get it? And, you see the girl and say yes, no matter how she is. I'll meet you back at the office. Look forward, look ahead. Come, dear come. Come. Come, Mr. Chadda. We were waiting for you. Actually, daddy is slightly busy... ...so, I've brought his wife along. Hi, I'm pammi. - Glad to meet you. This is my daughter, Anjali. Nonny. - Hi! If you two want to talk in private you'll can sit alone. There's nothing to talk about. - But, I want to talk. Don't feel shy. It's a good thing to know each other before getting married. Go, go dear. At the corner? You're so young. You don't look like Nonny's mother at all. I'm not Nonny's mother. I'm Chadda's second wife. Look, I love someone else. And, I'm pregnant with his child. - What? My daddy asked me not to tell you this. But, if you're ready to accept someone else's child Then, I'm ready too. Look, if you don't marry her we won't get the rest of the dowry. And, if we don't get the dowry how will we repay the debts. But... - I need to repay so many... Nine arrest warrants have been issued against me. But, Daddy she says that she's pregnant. So what? It's a scheme. Just like, get a comb free on a pack of soap. It's such an interesting offer.

Mr. Brijmohan Oberoi. He has enough money to last four generations. Really? - But, he has only one daughter. But the planet Mars is affecting her horoscope. He requires a boy that has a similar horoscope... Only then can she get married. Otherwise, everything is useless. Bet. Bet. - Yes, on 44. Yes. - Yes. Harbansh Chadda. - Brijmohan Oberoi. Oberoi? - Yes, Are you punjabi? - Yes. You're punjabi, I'm a punjabi. Come on, give me a hug. We're originally from India. - Really. And settled down here with a good business, - Very good. But, there's something that's irritating me. - What? We get to meet only at such occasions. Otherwise, the entire day we're busy making money. What's the use of this money? - You're absolutely right. My son, Nonny. - Nonny Chadda. - Okay. Hi. He's from Harvard. And, he's a top class graduate. - Okay. But it's useless. - Why? He isn't getting married. - What are you saying? God has made such a peculiar horoscope of his. Look. The girl and the boy should have the same horoscope. And, she should have mars in her horoscope. Now, where will I find such a girl? Please continue, playing Mr. Oberoi. Daddy. Excuse me, I'll be right back. - Yes. Daddy, what's wrong with my horoscope? There's nothing good about it. Since you were born, I've been seen bad times.

And, ask her to meet me at pan pacific hotel on the 20th. Sure, okay. And, no one should know about it. Have you heard that story? - Which story? One day, Lord Ganesha asked Lord Shiva "When will I get married?" So, Lord Shiva didn't know what answer to give... So, he said "Tomorrow". The next day, Lord Ganesh asked again "When will I get married?" Lord Shiva replied, "Didn't I say, tomorrow? - Yes." "Then come tomorrow." The third day, Lord Ganesh asked again and Lord Shiva replied,"Tomorrow." So this way, Lord Ganesh kept asking and, Lord Shiva kept replying, tomorrow. This way, Lord Ganesh never got married nor did Lord Shiva lie. But, why are you telling me this story? Because, in our story I'm Lord Ganesh and, you're Lord Shiva. And, this can't continue all our lives. My marriage has been fixed. Mannu, you know what my condition is. I've reached this far with debts worth millions. If I don't repay the debts... ...then, my mother and sister will be thrown on the streets. And, I'm working hard... ...and, not wasting away my time. Try to understand my condition as well. My marriage is on the 20th. Father has fixed everything. But still, if you call me before the last nuptial round... ...I'll come back to you. I can't promise you anything more, Ram. Come out, come out. What happened? I heard that your son is marrying someone else. Good that you heard about it. I was worried thinking about how to tell you this. What do you think I am? You take dowry from me... ...and get your son married to someone else. You gave me that money... ...because your daughter is pregnant. And, you want us to bear that burden. If you say anything against my daughter... ...I'll rip your tongue out. Look at that. Your daughter can do all the wrong things... ...but, we can't even speak about it. My son will get married wherever I ask him to. Then listen to me, I don't want your foolish son. - Fine. My daughter will find someone better. - Okay. Just return me my money, that's all. - Are you mad? Am I carrying your money in my pocket? I'll return you your money, only when I get it from them. Until I don't get my money... ...I'll see how your son gets married. Yes, do as you please. And listen... - What? I'll get my daughter married one minute before... ...your son gets married. Fine, note it down, note it down. My son will get married on the You get your daughter married at 12:29. Write it down, don't forget. There's no need to write it down. - I'll show you. The daughter's intelligent and her father's an idiot. Madam, it's the eve of Diwali, at least get me a new suit. Look at this. I've kept my pants up with a string. Please. I don't have a problem... ...whether my driver drives with the strings or without it. On this Diwali eve, will you do me a favour? - What? Fire me from this job. - Go away... But first, repay the loan... ...that your father took from me for your studies. I have the papers with his signatures. If you try to run, I'll make you not in the Singapore jail. And, do you know what happens in Singapore jail? Do you know? Do you know? They flog you. Do you want to go? - No. You say all the problems will be over. I ask, when? When there'll be wrinkles on my face. Will you marry me then? Look, Nitin I'm ready to stay with you in any condition. Fine, then come on. That's good. Let's go to my home, to that witch's home. Where we'll get rotten food, and abuses. Shall we go? I'm ready. - Are you got mad? You've lived such a life of leisure. And, now you want to live like a pauper. You mean to say... ...we should forget all the dreams that we've seen. Every time I get a proposal for marriage... ...I make different excuses, and avoid the subject. And this time, you're trying to avoid me. Look, Nitin my father has fixed my marriage. Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. - Thanks. Why don't you say something? What can I say? Do you have a solution? Oh yes, just say nice meeting you. Hey. Wait, wait. Here... Here take this too. Beggar. I'll commit suicide. You fool, stupid. Is this the way to stop a car? If I had delayed even a second... ...you would've been crushed under the car. Who asked you to apply the brakes? I was committing suicide. I cannot even die in peace now. Couldn't you find any other car in Singapore... ...that you hurled yourself in front of my car? Couldn't you think of any other way? I tried many things. I thought of consuming poison... ...but, I didn't have any money to buy them. I tried to hang myself... ...but the rope turned out to be expensive. I decided to set myself ablaze but then, I found out that petrol is more expensive than rope. Why are you so eager to die? So, why should I be keen to live? You know, at times Anjali would give me money. But now she's getting married as well. Now, I don't have that source of income either. Don't be tense. Come, lets sit in the van. Go somewhere, and think peacefully and then decide. What? And, if it's a good plan, then I'll join you too. Come on. The one I love is getting married too. Don't go anywhere alone. I'll just deliver this courier. Listen, be back soon. We've to decide today. Lao Tsao. He spoke against me. Listen, slit his tongue. He's been going overboard using it. People should know my name is Mamu. Mamu. Courier for you. Mamu, what's in this courier that it's so heavy. Nothing special, I askedmy people in Hong Kong to be head someone. It must be his skull. Maybe. I don't know. He was getting too hot headed. So, I just calmed him down. So, how are you? Would you like to have a beer? Bye. Yes, Get me some beer... What were you saying? Nitin, if we both die... ...who will be at loss? We, isn't it? I say, lets be positive. Who knows, there could be a miracle... ...and our fates might change. I've been thinking the samething for the past 20 years. There's always a miracle, but our life gets worse. You never know when fate destiny might change. Take Mamu for example, from that China... He would pick garbage and sell them. And, sleep right here. And, that too just five years ago. And now, his luck has changed for the better. How does their luck change? When the government imposed heavy duty on cigarettes... ...he would go to Malaysia buy cigarettes and sell them here. That's how he started. And then, he switched to stealing, pimping, hooliganism. That's how he became a don. I am telling you. Even you should do something like this. This is not a nice country, like ours. If you're caught stealing here, they behead you. In our country, if we know any influential man... ...we can get bailed out. But, if we don't get caught. We'll be rolling in money. But, what should we do? Let's do one thing. Let's kidnap your madam. We'll ask her for 10 million, or threaten to kill her. If you ask her for10 million, she'll say, "kill me". Then, can't we kidnap anyone else... ...whom she loves more than her life? She only loves money. Money, money. And, her rotten dog, she loves him too. - Dog? Yes. Just watch, one day I'll beat that dog black and blue. He's so arrogant. He scampers around like he's the boss. Then, let's kidnap him. She'll at least give us 50,000 for him. She'll give 50 million, she loves him so much. Then, lets do that. And, even if we're caught. Then, kidnapping a dog isn't a big crime. The dog won't even say anything. It's a suit... Mulchand. My dear Mulchand, Come to me. Come. Come on. Pick him up. Don't be afraid. It's just a dog. - I know. Come on. Come on. Listen, Nitin. Close his mouth. It shouldn't bark. Do it... - Yes, okay. He bit me. Catch him. Catch him... Catch him. Go. Catch him. You go... Go from the left. I'll take the right. I don't know him. Catch him. Not me! Let go! Where's he? Where's he? Yes. Where's that dog? What are you doing? - Free me... Where's that dog? You fool. - Is it a dog or a monkey? I'll kill it. I'll kill it today. I'll wipe out his clan... Shock... Now, you are free. Water! Get me water. Get water! Where's it? - Get water, you idiot! Get water! Here you go. - Pour it. I'm getting suffocated. Get it off me. - It's not coming off. Get it off me. I'm stuck. - Be quiet. Don't panic. Don't panic. - I'm getting suffocated. Free me! Free me. You fool. You dog! Idiot! Nitin, I found the dog. Nitin, I found the dog. Come on, come on. Get him in. "I'm an insane man." We're a millionaire. I'm crazy. We're a millionaire! We've gotten rich! Here you go, my dear. Let's go. "We've got the dog. - Yes we've." "We'll get the money. - Yes we will." What are you doing? What's wrong? Spoil brat. Come on. Shall we feed him something? - We're the hungry ones. We'll feed him something in the morning. And, is he your cousin? Why do you keep asking about him all the time? Wow. - Come here. Morning. Mr. Ram Mishra, please. Okay. Yes. - It's a grand hotel. Must be very expensive. Don't worry, I have money to pay one day's rent until then, the old hag will pay up. And, if you stay in a nice place... ...no one suspects you. Excuse me, where's the house phone. Thank you. - Yes, madam. Right. Just sign here. Hello. - Anjali, I'm at pan pacific hotel. All our problems are over now. Just leave everything and come here. What's the room number?

You might find something. This much here is 2... 3.30 cents. Do you want? $5, please. Nitin Bankar kidnapped. Ram, we've just one brush. Where's the other brush? The brush isn't here?

I'm right before you. Have you lost your mind? What's this? What's this? What's this? - Let me see. This is some small child, that's been kidnapped... That's me.

Where did he go? - The dog isn't inside? Where did the dog go? He's passed stools. Who'll pay Rs.10 million for it? What will we do now? We set out to be rich. Instead, we were robbed of what we had. Do you know that means? When we were driving, that dog fled back to that witch. What had we written there? Pay us 10 million, or be ready to collect that dog's corpse. She thinks I'm the dog. Because I'm missing from there. She thinks I've been kidnapped. - What shall we do now? We don't need to do anything. Now, the police will do whatever needs to be done. We'll be sentenced for 150 years. When I took you along, I knew something was bound to go wrong. Where did you get that piece ofjunk from? The junk seller? Why are you blaming me for everything? Kidnapping isn't my business. So, am I giving lessons on kidnapping? - Be quiet. You brought that piece of crap... ...that, won't even open. And, that dog ran away from it... ...along with your 10 million. I've heard about humans deceiving humans... ...but this is the first time I've heard dog deceiving human. I was on my way to commit suicide. But no, you stopped me and said... ...lets become someonelike Mamu. Now be like Mamu. Are you satisfied now? Fine, it isn't too late now. Let's commit suicide before the police arrive. Come on. Come on. Come. What are you doing? - We'll commit suicide? Where are you taking the clothes? Are you going for your honeymoon? We'll go to the same bridge, we had gone before... ...and commit suicide there, Come on. We cannot go there. - Why? We don't have enough petrol in the van to go there. Are you flat broke? Don't you have any money? I don't have money to buy poison. I used the company's money for the hotel. Now, I'll have to pay that as well. I've an idea, we'll jump down from the hotel's terrace. But, we'll do it carefully. Because, I don't want us to become cripple, If we become cripples. We'll have to spend our lives in jail like cripples. We'll go to the terrace, and jump down carefully. Okay. Come on. We'll die carefully. Come on. I am here. Where are you two going? To die, to commit suicide. Die? Yes. We don't have any other option left. Anjali, go back home and settle down with someone. Our plans have been foiled. We've failed. Then, I'll come along with you too. - Why do you want to die? You called me here to get married. Where else can I go? I've left a goodbye note at home. I took everything Icould get my hands on. I'm not going anywhere. Go, die and come back. What now? I need little time to think. In a surprising turn of events, Ms. Kaur has refused... ...to pay the ransom demanded by the kidnappers. This decision has sparked a public upheaval... ...amongst the local Indian community. She has so much wealth. Can't she give some money and save his life? I won't pay a single penny to save him. Have you got that? I think, we Indians should get together... and, hold a demonstration against her. And, stop going to her mall. "I didn't feel any shame, I danced so vigorously." Heera speaking.' - Hello. Yes, Suri, I'm leaving now. Ask Anu to be at pacific Hotel, and book a room there. I'll be there too, and tell here where I am. And, the rest will be as we discussed earlier. I'm leaving for a business conference. I'll return after a week. Where are you going, Brother-in-law? - To Malaysia, for business. What's wrong, sister? - He's getting married again. What? He said, I'm going to Malaysia. - He's lying. I heard everything on the phone myself. We had 12 petrol pumps and 5 restaurants. Every time he gets married... each woman takes away something. We're losing everything. Now, all we have left... are two petrol pumps and one restaurant. Brother, if we lose even that... what will I give my daughter? - Don't worry, Sister. I'll take care of it. Brother will never marry anyone else again. Hello, Mamu. Call for you. Hello. - Mamu. Mamu speaking. Yes. Repeat the target's name. What? Musa. Heerapurwala. Don't worry. I've the right man for this job. Kaala. There's a job for you. How much will I get? As much as you want? - Tell me the job. There's a man in pan pacific Hotel, Musa Heerapurwala. You need to finish him. It's easy. I'll plant a bomb between his legs. It should look like an accident, and not murder. Don't worry, Mamu. I've a strong medicine that can knock a man out cold from a distance. Good. Then, I'll throw him in a lake or a pond. The police will think he drowned to his death. Very good. Here's the number of the party that wants him dead. Talk to them if needed. But remember, my share will be 10%. You'll handover the corpse to the party and, also collect the money from them. Okay. Done. Pay the ransom. - Pay the ransom. We cannot tolerate any more losses. What is this? Ma'am, this is our complaint against you. All these shops have been closed for so many days. Look madam, our business has been ruined. I feel, we'll have to close down all the shops. Either you pay the ransom and get Nitin back. - Or return us our deposit. We don't want to run our shops in your mall. Where are you going? I'm going. That's all you could think of, all this while. No, I thought of many things. Do you want to know? Tell me. Go back to that witch and tell her that you escaped from the clutches of the kidnapper. Simple. Or else, I suggest that you go to the terrace, and jump down. And, Anjali stop thinking. Go back to your father and, tell him that you've changed your mind. You'll have a better life. Hey, excuse me, what've you thought about yourself? I've thought of postponing my suicide for a few days. I'm thinking, that I'll see an astrologer... and, ask him which is the best day to die. So, that I die on a good day. And, my soul doesn't have to beg around like me. So, if you don't find a good day... you will never die. No. - That means you've decided to leave. Yes, I've decided to leave. - Confirmed. Come on, then close this. - I'm closing it. Close it, quickly and get out now. - I'm leaving. Who wants to stay here? I'm going... And, remember one thing. If you set a foot out of this room... then, I'll tell thepolice that you kidnapped me. Now go. You're back to your ownself again, aren't you? And, aren't you trying to cheat me? You cheat. I was on my way to die, you stopped me. Showed me dreams. You put me in a fix, I won't spare you either. Really. - Stop using such crude language. In a recent turn of events... Just watch what they're showing on television. Ms. Kaur has finally... ...agreed to pay the ransom. Ms. Kaur was speaking to the press earlier today. She's still awaiting the demands of the kidnappers. Here's more. Kuljeet Kaur, is it true that you're ready to pay the kidnappers. Yes, I have. I'll pay those scoundrels the money. But, they should first call me... and tell me where I should get the money. Shall I take the money to their in-laws... We're rich... - Not we, I'm rich... You were leaving. Go. So, what now? Go to the astrologer quickly... and, ask him when are you going to die? I'll take the money from that old hag... ...buy a Mercedes and attend your funeral in style. You're back to your ownself again, aren't you? Money has blinded you, hasn't it? Do you call this friendship, Nitin? A true friends stands besides you at troubled times... ...remember that, and those who run away are cowards. God. - Will you two stop quarrelling now? Think how we can get the money. We'll have to carefully make a plan. But, first we need to decide... where we'll hide after leaving from here. Don't stress. We can hide here. I'll look after all that. Come, welcome, welcome. Come, welcome, welcome. All of you collect your handbags. And, your luggage will be taken to your rooms. Come, come please. - Let's go. - Come, let us go. Move. Move. - Come on. Come on. 'The party's over here.' I'd like you to bill my room... You've broken 40 glasses in a month, soiled the dresses... ...of 15 guests, this is my last warning to you. If I ever get a complaint again, if you break anything... ...make any mistake or create a racket in the hotel in a drunk state... ...I'll throw you outof the hotel. Get that.

You will have to find that out... ...what are we paying you for? - If that's the case... ...then, send me his photo and advance. And, the remaining amount after he's dead. One more, one more.

That vixen must be there. Yes. Then, why don't you go and get her back? Guests are arriving from India for the marriage. If they ask where is that vixen, what will I say? I'll tell her that she's gone to the temple for praying. The marriage is on the 12th. And, I want my daughter back home before that. That's all. Once I find that vixen... It's okay, if she agrees to come home. Otherwise, I'll kill her right there. So, shall we go? - Where to? To bring that vixen back. How dare you call my daughter a vixen? I thought that's her name. Dear, bow to him. Bless you, dear. We're so fortunate that you attended the marriage. Your presence has added to my grandeur... ...otherwise, this marriage would've felt incomplete.

Hello, Mamu. My name is Nitin. - Nitin? Who? I'm Ram's friend. That Ramayan one? - No, not the Ramayan one... the courier boy. Yes, I know him. Tell me, what do you want? It's very urgent. But Ram said that only you can do it. What do you want? What do you want? Yes, I... I need a corpse. What? Corpse? Whose? - Anyone's will do? But he should be fair, should be 6ft tall. Should have good muscles, firm body. And yes, he should have small hair, Mamu. The type of dead body you're asking for... ...we'll have to look for it. Then, we'll have to beat him. Then kill him. And, if you want small hair... ...then, we'll get him a hair cut after killing him. And, it'll cost you and will take time. Think about it. - Don't worry about the money. I can pay any price. And yes, we'll need an advance before taking the order. Yes, we'll pay you that. Tell me how much you want, I'll have it delivered. Where are you right now? Fine. - My man will be there, give him 10,000. And the rest, after delivery of body. - Okay. Remember that. Hey, how will my man recognise you? When he arrives, I'll tell him it's me. What are you worried about? No, no he hasn't seen you... ...so, how will he recognise you? Give me a symbol. Oh, that. How will he recognise me? I know, tell him I'll be waiting outside the hotel... ...holding a white orchid in my hand. Okay. And he has to say in my ears... ..."I'm Mamu's man, I'm Mamu's man". I'll understand. Fine, you stand outside the hotel. And, keep waving the flower. My man will recognise you, okay. Idiot. - Sorry. $21, sir. - Thank you. Taxi. Will you go to the railway station? Temple. Church. Then, what's this piece of crap for? Are you sure this is the hotel? Boss, there's just one pan pacific in Singapore. This one. Which room? Which room? Come on, pick up the luggage. Come on. We don't need to pick up the luggage. There are people to do that in such hotels. Come on, let's go. Come on. Why is he holding a flower? In such big hotels, guests are welcomed with a flower. Really? It's a good way to extract money from people. There's that scoundrel. Catch him, catch him. - Stop! Stop! Stop... catch him. Where did he go? Where did he go? Boss, he's inside.

Get that... He was holding these flowers, isn't it? - Yes. The scoundrel. That rascal must be in this room. In this room. Open up. I think he's not alone. There's someone else with him. I don't care. My daughter's inside, and I'll take her back with me. Open it. - Who is it? I... I'll break open this door. If anyone comes out, pounce on him. Come on, surround me. Surround me. - Come on. Why you... Who are you? Lamba, I'll not spare you. Where's the rascal? - Kamini is in the bathroom getting ready. Are you getting dressed for your father's funeral? Come you, you rascal. You dare pull on my towel. Get out. Run. Run. Who was that scoundrel? Catch him. Security, this is paramjeet Singh Lamba... ...Indian ambassador. A terrorist has barged in my room. I left the door open. Who could've closed it? You had ordered for tea. Keep it there and leave. Why do they always come when I'm having a bath? Hello. What are you staring at? You've kept the tea, now get lost. Call me when you're done. For clearing the tray. I'll pay your money tomorrow. It's afternoon now. Yes, its not morning any more. So, call me tomorrow. But, where should I come to collect the money? Call me tomorrow morning. I'll tell you tomorrow. I'll switch off the phone until I don't get the money. Which fool invented the mobile? I'll lock the cell-phone in it. "De Dana Dan." "De Dana Dan." There's a limit to tolerance. Anyone's barging inside the hotel. Barging inside the room, beating people up. Is this a hotel, or a circus? Call the police right now. I'll call the commissioner right away. Sir, if you call the police, it'll defame our hotel. Then look for him in every room. Sir, there are more than 400 rooms. If we take you to every room... ...and, keep asking "Is he the one?". Our guests will feel insulted. He must be around somewhere? Do you know what he looks like? He vanished into thin air in a jiffy. He looked like a wildhog with a moustache. If I see that moustache anywhere, I'll recognise him. If you spot him anywhere, please inform us, He will not walk out of here on his two feet, we assure you that. Boss, come here. If we fall in their trap, we'll be in trouble. Nobody will recognise me if I shave off my moustache. I arranged Anjali's marriage with great difficulty. What now? I can't go back without Anjali. Go, and book a room in this hotel. Mannu. What are you doing here? And, how did you come here? You said, that I'll come with you... ...even if you call me before my last nuptial round. So, here I am. Are you joking, or being serious? My entire family, relatives everyone is here... ...and, keeping a watch on me. If I come with you without informing them... Think carefully before you do anything. Just tell me the time. That time hasn't arrived yet. So, when will it arrive? There are only three days left for the marriage. As soon as I get the money, I'll take you along. I've been waiting for that.

Because, tomorrow and the day after are bank holidays. So, by Monday morning... ...I'll give you all the money that we had discussed. That's okay, you can give me whenever it's convenient. Okay. Yes. Come with me, I need to talk to you. Why did you say that you don't want the money? He'll keep making excuses after the marriage... ...and, you'll have to beg him.

My friend Nitin is stuck in a cupboard in one of the rooms. I was searching for him. I couldn't find him, so I told you because you're the waiter. How can I find him?

Be careful, and walk differently. Go, go, go. All the best. Give me the money. I've heard that voice before? Don't try to be a detective. Give me the money. Aren't you ashamed of doing these things? Does your mother know you're doing these things? My mother is no more, give me the money. Where is my servant? If you give me the money... ...I'll handover your servant to you.

Ask him about the kidnappers... ...and get me back my money. He needs rest now. - Okay He needs rest now. Nitin, what's wrong with you? Have you come here to see whether I'm dead or alive? So, that you can run away with all the money. That's why you fled leaving me there. What else could I've done? The police would've arrested me for kidnapping you. Where is the money? We've to get out of here any how. They're waiting outside for me to be conscious again... ...and, ask me about the kidnapper. How many wives and children he has? What will I tell them? Where is my shoe? What shall we do now? Call up Mamu, and ask him to get hold of anyone... ...thrash him, kill him and give us the dead body. That's all. What will we do with the dead body? We're cannibals, we'll devour it. We'll throw it in a lake or pond... and, tell the police his description. Come on, now. Call Mami... I mean, Mamu. We've traced the number of the kidnapper. from this number. Then, find out who he is? - His name is Harbansh Chadda. Oh, but you know what? You all are the same. Doctor, he has come to his senses. - I don't think that he will... Oh! Okay. He has regained consciousness. Can you describe the kidnapper? Can you describe the kidnapper? What's wrong? Have you gone deaf? They are asking for the description of the kidnapper. Tell them, Who am I? What am I doing here? If I slap him once, he'll remember everything. Shall I remind you who you are? I'm your maid, now do you remember? Do you remember? Please don't disturb him, he has lost his memory. Memory. - Not on the ground, on the bed. Sir, we have a sketch of the kidnapper... as per the eye-witness. The kidnapper was driving the van. And, he fled after the van met with an accident. God, look at his face. He looks like a ferocious criminal. You have his name, number and photo. What else are you waiting for, his horoscope? Look for him, We've traced the call. It was made from pacific hotel. He must be hiding in some corner of that hotel. Go. Come with me. - I'll come too. And, when I lay my hands on him, I'll teach him a good lesson... And then, I'll give you a sound beating. I'm in a fix. They have my sketch. If they catch me, I'm... How did they know we were in the same hotel? Who did I kidnap? It's Mamu's call. I'll tell him we don't need the corpse. Because the police think you are the kidnapper. Okay. Go ahead. Tell him, tell him. Handle everything. Hello. I'm waiting outside the hotel with the dead body. What should I do with it? - We don't need the dead body now. Why don't you want it? With great difficulty, I stole it from the morgue. You will have to buy it. I don't want it. You can sell it to someone else. This is not some vegetable that people buy over the counter. You don't know who I am. The whole of Singapore is scared of me. Lf... - What are you doing? Why are you talking so loudly? Someone else ishaving a conversation too. Speak softly. Yes. - What can I say? Iknow you're in this hotel. I will find you, no matter what? Come on. I said I don't want it. You can do whatever you want. What will I do with the dead body? And, you can die along with him. But spare me. - Spare me, spare me. - Hey, why are you screaming now? Hello, where are you? - When you scream, I can't hear anything. Nitin, let's go. Mamu. I trusted you, and brought the dead body without the advance. And, now you say you don't want the dead body. You're the rascal. I gave Who did you give it to? When did you give it? The one whom you sent to collect the advance. But he said there wasn't anyone there. You're lying. - You're lying. - So what if he said so? You want money, don't you? I'll give it. I'll get it from the room. Come on. But I gave the advance... - But, do come back. And, you'll have to pay for the coffin as well. Why? - The coffin doesn't come for free. Fine, we'll pay you. - Pay me. - Bag. - Come on. We don't have to see the money... ...we need to flee with it. Come on. Who are you? Swami Krishna Murari. - Why do you want to kill him? I was asked to kill him. - To kill you? Not me, I was told you kill you. - Who was it? It's the principle of our business. We never reveal the party's name, sir. To hell with your principles. You can beat me as much as you want, sir. But I won't tell you his name. I can give his photo. You're lying, scoundrel. If you didn't ask him to kill him... ...then, how did he get hold of this photograph? The photograph proves nothing. I've Mahatma Gandhi's photograph in my house. Does that mean I ordered to assassinate him? Sir, forget the photograph... ...he also paid memoney to kill him. When did I give you money? - I haven't written down the date. And he said,"I'll pay you the rest... when I see his dead body." Sir, I won't lie. It's my business. Was he alone, or was there someone else with him? Sir, there was chicken curry in my eyes. That's why, I couldn't recognise... ...the one who gave me money. Oh, so you eat from your eyes. This is a conspiracy. A conspiracy. It's this trickster's plan to cancel the marriage. That's cancelled anyway. And, return me all the money that I gave you. What money? - You thief, your wife took the money from me. Ask her to return me my money. I'll slap you silly. He's lying. Go ask your wife, whether she took the money from me or not? She took money from you too? She took money from me as well. She has cheated many people with her beauty. And him... he's her pimp. You rascal, don't you dare... Who is this rascal? I've never seen him before? Who is he? Who left him back here? Oh, God I was sending my daughterin such a disgusting family. I want my money back right now. Right now. - I don't understand anything. Let me explain... first get your wife here. Do you want to pounce on her again? Lusftul... I'll bring her wherever you want. Butjust see that no one moves from here. I'll be right back. Pammi. Pammi. Pammi. - What? - Why? Another man... my money. - My money. Sir, please try to get my money back as well. What? Look, no one will move until we know the truth. Come on, sit here, sit here, sit down. - But, why aren't you arresting him? Sir, I cannot arrest him on the basis of this photo. Why are you here?
