My stairs are tiled. - What's that got to do... - I might slip! Old folks always think they're going to slip. Calm down. I'm going to get help, wait here. Eudes! Come and help, he's in a foul mood. Here's half, the rest you can get from her. Hi there Alvaro, let me help. I'm all right. There you go, nice and easy. lvaro, Dona Alice, excuse me! Easy now, hold your horses! - Sorry to bother you... - Go on then! Sorry everyone! - It's so hot, I'm sorry. - Now let's go. Nice and easy. Help me, Bel! Coming. How long will this go on for? About midnight. Midnight?! - Hi! - Long time! Yes, I brought a friend. This is Nice. Let me pay. Certainly not, you're my guest of honor. It's her first time, she didn't want to come. Marquinhos! You're very late. I had to stop off and fetch an amplifier. Enough of your excuses! We're professionals. Come on, get a move on. - Who's the doll? - She's helping with the sound. You know women wearing pants aren't allowed in. Got a skirt? Go on, put it on then. Give me a hand Glson, take this. Amazing! Isn't it wonderful? There you go, Dona Alice. What's up, lvaro, starting to fall apart already? I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Weird, isn't he? Wears tons of perfume. Stinks to high heaven! No one'll dance with him. Skunko! Skunko? Yuck Elza, that's awful! You're too lenient. He won't sing caged up. Who's talking about cages? So, you all alone? Come and join us, come on. Thanks. There, take a seat. Hi girls! I've been keeping this seat for you. Great! So? You're looking gorgeous as usual. Really? Thanks. Sure missed you. Without you this dance is a night without its brightest star. And I'm a sailor without his guiding star adrift in the hall. My daughter and granddaughter moved out yesterday. I'm all alone. So if we wanted to have that nice hot cappuccino only you... know how to make, we wouldn't be disturbing anyone, right? We definitely won't be disturbing anyone. Sure, it's really lively, I thought it'd be... I don't know... the music would be more old-fashioned. I didn't think it'd be like this. Very good. Is everyone married? Some. A lot are single. Plenty. They dance well. - Yes! - May I have the honor? I can't dance properly. Come on, I'll lead. Go on! You tell him off. Ballroom men are no good, I've warned you before. - Shall we dance? - Of course, with pleasure. - How are you? - I'm fine. - Anything missing? - Two more cables... Ow, damn thing's hurting, we shouldn't have come. I like seeing people dance. I don't mind not dancing, but I like to watch! There's no one here worth watching dance. What about the Argentine? - He only dances the tango well. - No! The rest is a disaster. He dances very well samba, bolero, even the cha-cha-ch. We've won that contest I don't know how many times. Yes, although lately the Argentine and his wife have been winning... but I think you two are much better. We lost because Alice forgets half the steps. That's age, though. I think if I'm to win again I'll have to find another partner. Nonsense, Ivaro, the Argentine's wife has nothing on Dona Alice. Ernesto, you're drinking too much. It's not good for you. - Good evening, Dona Alice. - Good evening. I see you're indisposed tonight... so would you agree to allow me to dance with Dona Alice? Go ahead! I'm very flattered by your invitation... but lvaro really is indisposed... so I'd rather just keep him company. That's what I call a real lady. You're a lucky man. If I were a lucky man my foot wouldn't be in the state it is. Well, could be worse. - Yes, it could be your foot, right? - lvaro! Anyway, I hope it gets better quickly. Slimy fool, very unpleasant. Ah, passion fruit cocktails! "Fruit de la passion", as the French say. I didn't order that. It's from Eudes. - He's so kind! - Thanks. This Thursday, the Great Violets Ball... to reserve your table 3672-0351. Now I'd like to call up on stage the singers Vanderley and Ana... with their dancing hits, the greatest band in So Paulo... Silver Moonlight! Don't let samba die... Wow, that old guy's hot! In such good shape, look. If only he'd ask me to dance. Alice, would you get me an analgesic? Of course, be right back. - Hi Alice, you all right? - Fine. - Are you okay? - Yeah. And you? I lost that recipe you gave me. Could you give it to me again? - Of course, not now though. - Why not? Not now, I'm doing something else. Which is? Why, why? So, lvaro, enjoying the ball? Lively night, right? Got your eye on any of the ladies? - They're all useless. - You finished with this? - No, leave that. - But it's finished. No, I'm drinking that, leave it there. Off you go. I can tell today's not my lucky day. Why? You think it's my dress? But it's new, Selma made it for me. What nonsense, Elza! Elza! Hi! You all right? Aren't you going to introduce your friend? Of course, this is Nice, she lives in my building. - My pleasure, Nice. - Hello. - Ernesto. - Nice. Single, married, widow or playing the field? Widow. Careful with Elza's stories, she's an expert at fiction. Just kidding. Elza's a regular here at the dance. I've had bold women before Shy ones Expierienced ones Married and Ionely Single and happy I've had maidens and even whores Intellectual women And crazy ones Confused women, of war and peace But none of them Made me as happy as you do Look, the best part is dancing in the hall... there's no fun just looking. There are only two things prevent a lady from being asked to dance not knowing how to dance, and bad breath. Excuse me. Just kidding! Nice dress, that. Very nice. What a bore! Not only that, he can't dance to save his life. - Really? - Terrible dancer. GIson! Yes, lvaro. Alice went to fetch me an analgesic but she must have forgotten. - Oh, here you are. - No, no, no. - Here, take it. - No, you take them to her. What? Take them and tell her to bring one to me. She'll get all upset if she realizes she forgot. Well, you're the boss. Be patient, Margarida. Dona Alice... lvaro's pills. Oh yes! - Thank you so much. - Don't mention it. - There's one missing. - No that's right. Right, cheers! Now to finish off, let's dance. - Hi honey, how are you? - Fine, you? - This is my wife. - A pleasure! - It's her birthday today. - Congratulations! Here's your medicine. Thanks. The main thing is, you didn't forget. Yes. Alice, look... everything that's important, pay attention... you write down on this piece of paper. And from time to time you read it. Take care only to write down what's important. Here, put it in your bag. He's married and always promised to respect my space to never bring that wife of his here. I was at the window and suddenly in he walks with her. Damn, he promised never to do that. He's got a nerve! He hasn't heard the last of this! It's really full. It's full but look, everyone's dancing. - Vagner, please. - Come on, it's just us. I know honey, but I want to dance in the hall. Tonight's our night! It's ours and you think I'm not going to dance in the hall? Alice... you've got to more carefully choosing your friends. It's Aurelina. She's so cheap. It doesn't do to keep company with that sort of a woman. But I really like her. If you like her it's because you'd like to be like her, an easy woman. You really are unbearable today! Take it or leave it. What's that supposed to mean? Look, what you just said, I won't have it. Take it or leave it? I'm off! Excuse me. Shit, Moraes! I'm sorry folks, I'm upset. Won't happen again. Interrupting the dance is a sign of disrespect. Really guys, come on, let's carry on. Hope it doesn't stop again, we'll see. - Dionsio! - Eudes! - Long time! - Nice so see you back. I went to the hospital three times but they wouldn't let me in. Look Eudes... I'm going to tell you something, man I saw death close up. I damn well saw death close up. I spent a fortnight... in intensive care dancing cheek to cheek with death. I want to show you something. Oh my God, no, no, forget it. That's a trophy, let's say a tattoo. You're just like some kid now, got a tattoo on your chest. Iolanda, ask Alice to join us. Alice, sit with us. You know, I've got my eye on lvaro. Really? Yeah, he's drinking chasers... I gave him an analgesic and now he's drinking whisky. It's only normal, him drinking his whisky from time to time, but... he has a broken foot. Poor thing. The Argentine asked me to dance, we danced for a bit... but then I felt uneasy not dancing with lvaro. I'm so used to it. I'm just going to have another look. Hey you! None of that! Sorry. They stick this thing in you here. God save us. But you saw nothing? Nothing, I was out cold, anaesthetized. Afterwards the pain's tough. That's when you remember your friends. Dionsio I saw... Dionsio I thought... I saw this place, the hall... saw you, my great friend... the band, the maestro... saw our girls. Hi there, Dona Rita? The table is reserved, may I bring your bottle? Please do. Chico, Rita's bottle. That one there, right? That's right. Hey, I'm talking to you, what do you think you're staring at? She's gorgeous, though. Sure is. She pulls up in a great big foreign car, parks at the mall, the chauffeur waits. She takes a taxi and comes here. - Hiding from her husband. - Exactly. That's her alibi, the mall. You think you've got what it takes? And why not? - Like hell you have, old boy. - Why not? - You still packing it, are you? - Sure I am, what do you think? - Well, quite a difference. - What do you mean? You're no good but I like you All I want to know is why If your life were a movie, which would it be? - Rebel Without a cause. - Very good. Look, look! He's so handsome, just look at him dance. - Just right. - That kid's going to be famous. - Wonderful! - Told you. So do you want to or not? Yes, but let's negotiate something. How much is it? Six numbers, R$20. No, R$20 for the whole dance and I get to take him home. Don't exaggerate, my dear. Look... There are five waiting in line before you. Half, half! I'll catch you later. Watch out! Gorgeous! Eudes really has a crush on you. Given half a chance he'll eat out of the palm of your hand. Aurelina, women work with a thousand push buttons... We've all these switches... To turn us on, you have to know what you're doing, if you flick the wrong switch, the whole thing shuts down. Not men though, men have just the one master switch. Know what I mean? A new piece of skirt and they completely lose it. If I were you I'd press all your little buttons... and turn off Eudes' master switch. Well lvaro? Are you worried? Me? Your foot, what happened? Oh, it's nothing, I tore a tendon. Wow, a tendon? Are you sure? If you did there'll be no more dancing for you. Look at all your trophies, the king of the ballroom. And me stuck at home amid all the nappies. What do you want? You want me to apologize? The kids are grown up, our children... the grandchildren too... there. I've so many reasons to be happy. Anyway, if you look back, all you see is yourself. But at least you're coherent. Who are you Who were you You're nothing If in life I erred You were wrong too If I erred If I sinned No matter If in your eyes I'm dead To me you too have died Chico! See to Fontes's table! 12th December, don't miss the Great Violets Ball with the band Carisma 3. Tickets on sale as of Tuesday. I'll see... - Hi! - Hi. I was asked to give you this. By whom? That guy over there, Marquinhos. I've told you before, the mixer's broken, and so's the speaker. Why stop now? Don't stop now! What is it? - Stop! - Stop what? Stop bothering people. - I'm not bothering anyone. - Yes, you are. - He asked me to dance. - Look, eat something. - I don't want to. - Have a sandwich! I don't want to, I'm not hungry. How come you're not hungry? You haven't eaten anything for ages, go on. I don't want to. You've been drinking, right? Yes. Fruit de la passion... passion fruit cocktail. Don't you think you're overdoing it dancing with that old guy? At least I'm having fun. Yeah, having fun with some dirty old man! And you stop drinking, we've got a long way to go tonight. Have it. Marquinhos! I don't want to. The music! Hey! You and Ivaro are both widowed, with so much in common, Alice. I can't understand why you never decided to live together. I don't know, first he was married... you know? Later things just settled like this. There are certain things can only happen when you're young. Thank you. It's mine! It's mine, I was first. - Let me have it. - No. Please. - Go find someone to dance with. - But I haven't had a dance yet! That's your problem, dear. Well, really! Look at the flag. Put it in your diary, it's finally over. I never want to see you again, ok? We'll talk about that later. No respect! It's not lack of respect, you don't understand. We'll talk about it later, you have to understand it's her birthday, she didn't want to go to another dance. She wanted to come here. Well you screwed up, stay with her, she's all yours... I'm through with you, complete lack of respect. - We'll talk later. - No, it's over. - Don't make a scene. - Bye! Who is he, you know him? Yes, he's my husband, Vgner. - Really? - Really, Vgner? Oh, I see. And who's she? No idea, I don't know her. You just going to sit here holding that flag? I'm waiting for some cute guy to come along. - Just sitting there? - Give it to me! I'm waiting for him to come on onto the floor. There are no cute guys here. No, but there are a few old wolves, tigers. So go and get yourself an old wolf. Sr. Ernesto... Sr. Ernesto, your wife is waiting for you at the cloakroom. Did he say my wife was waiting for me at the cloakroom? Yes. What a liar, the crook... he always said he was a widower, for years. The crook, liar! Widower! Hey Ernesto, what's wrong? What's going on? Get some fresh air, come on. You haven't the courage to speak to your wife, right? - Sit down, go on. - Thanks. Where did you tell her you'd been all this time? Vanderley, can I have a word? If anyone complains about me to you, will you let me know? Sure. Had enough? Yeah. Well, you sure danced plenty. I had fun. You see, and you didn't even want to come to the dance. What was he just telling you? Nothing. Nothing, so what were you laughing at? He was teaching me to dance, Marquinhos. Just teaching you to dance? Just teaching me to dance. Whatever you say. What? Whatever you say. Good. Good... Vanderley and Ana are back to present So Paulo's... greatest band: Silver Moonlight. Didn't you get anything? What do you mean? Didn't someone give you something earlier on? Yes they did... thanks. I'm going to get some water, ok? Excuse me. Who's the one looking for Ernesto? - Over there. - That one? - Yes. - Thanks. I'm sorry, excuse me. Are you the one looking for Ernesto? Yes, that's him, my husband. How do you do, I'm sorry. Oh Chico. - What is it? - May I sit here? Something upset you? Upset? Yes a little, perhaps. You should avoid that at your age. What's this, some cheap soap opera prescription? No, all I meant was, easy on the dating, the booze, cigarettes. All right, I'll just lie down in my coffin... and wait for my time to come. Is that it? Whatever you say, Ernesto. I'm just trying to help. Came here to drink some water? Yeah. It's mad me being here. It's as if it didn't exist, like I'm imagining all this. With me it's just the opposite. Hey! What happened? Power cut, it happens sometimes. Let's go over there where it's cooler, come on. I don't think I'll reach the age of these people. Nonsense! My dad died at 28. You know the Cyclops myth? No. Oh but you should. The Cyclops was a giant with just the one eye... really strong, very powerful, he could tear out a tree with one arm. But all the same, he lived alone, sad, you know why? Because he knew the day he would die. - Must be unbearable. - Yeah. That's why sometimes I think it's not good knowing too much. I think I'll confront the shadows. You what? I'm going to the bathroom. 50%, but I danced with plenty of women... 8 women, that's already 80 just my cut, right? - Here's 50, ok? - Yeah. Here's another 20, that's 70... the rest will have to be in coins. Coins? You don't get it, do you? Get what? I don't understand. Don't understand? Get with it. The girl here just now is old enough to be your granddaughter! What's that got to do with anything? It's got to do with her being my girlfriend. Now do you get it? It's got to do with her being my girlfriend. If you go near her again, just 'cause you're an old guy doesn't mean I won't beat the shit out of you, ok? What do you mean, you're... - I'm what? - Crazy. - Crazy. - Crazy? What you're saying is complete nonsense. - Like hell it is. - I don't like violence. - Then stay away from her. - I came here to dance. Stay away from her or I'll smash your face in. Marquinhos, let's go, I can't do it all by myself! Thank god you're here. Be careful! I'll put the candle there. Shit! Are you all right? Did you hurt your finger? I'm all right, Moraes. Hi GIson! Hi Ferreira, you'll never get married looking like that look at the state of your shirt, soaking wet. I haven't got another one. Go change that shirt, I'll lend you one if you like. Glson? - Glson! - Wait a minute. Hi. Come here. Please... give this to lvaro. All right. It's from Alice. Dear Ivaro, does our duo need to end like this? This way? My heart... I don't know why... beats so happy when it sees you. And my eyes smile and follow you through the streets. But you still avoid me... Oh, if only you knew how loving I am... how very much I want you... and how sincere my love is I know you'd no longer avoid me... Come, come, come, come... I'd like her to come with me more, be more of a companion... always be with me, so that we can have some fun together. Sure. Hey Chico, bring me a water, please. Can you believe I once had a fight with another women in the street? Pulling each other's hair out, screaming like crazy. Vgner had so many... but I never managed to get him out of me. It must be something of mine. Doesn't it bother you knowing he loves someone else? Loves? You mean going to bed with someone else? Because to me love is something quite different. Liana, sometimes an hour in a motel is worth more than a lifetime of marriage. - What sort of a love is that? - Of course! My god, a wonderful sort of love! That's what makes me live, honey. - And makes you happy? - Alive, I'm alive. Well congratulations, a completely different concept of love. Wake up Liana, think about it. Bye. Hey, come here. I'd so like to dance with you. I can't dance, I'm working. - Just for a bit. - I can't. Marquinhos, what are you doing here? Get back to work, the old man already told you off once! I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to sin something wicked with that one, I can tell you! Sinning's dirty. Oh but Alice, that's how I like it. You see, I just love a naked man... all sweaty on top of me. You need a serious relationship. Let's go and settle up? Sure. That's shameful, no respect. Be right with you! Cancel that order and bring another, it's taking too long. You're upset today, take it easy. I'll bring you something nice on the house, you'll see. Jesus, what a bunch ofjerks. Hey Marquinhos... Bel's dancing with someone at the back, ok? Here, a message for you. Come on, for god's sake, let's not be so gloomy. It's a wonderful night, for those who want to live. You're absolutely right, no misery tonight. Forget it. Tomorrow I want to get back to my ceramics. Especially since my energy as a woman comes from clay, not men. They're great! Especially on rainy days. But my happiness doesn't depend on them. My happiness comes from here. Mother Earth! Where do you think you're going? - My girlfriend... - We need to have a little talk. I just need to talk to my girlfriend. - Do you want this job? - I've been working here for 5 years. But do you want this job? I work hard every day, I just need a word with my girlfriend. Then stay in your place and work, that's your place. I know my place, I just need... Just stay there, no girlfriends, here you just work. There'll be no dating, just work. I'd like to thank our singers Vanderley and Ana with their band Silver Moonlight. Don't miss, 18th December, Wednesday, the Red Ball. At Rua Guaicurus 1, gua Branca. I don't even care about that! You liar, just look at the state you're in because your wife came. Your mistake, she didn't come. Your information network made a mistake. But you're married, you're not a widower. Yes, I'm not a widower. My marriage ended 20 years ago, there's no love. I live in peace and let my wife live her life in peace. That's better than having a grumpy old husband moping about the house getting on her nerves from morning to night. My philosophy of life is... if I'm given a lemon, I squeeze it, add sugar and make lemonade. The sugar in my lemonade are my grandchildren, want to see? Yes of course. Wow, look, very lovely. They look like you. It's funny, when I was a son, I loved my family. Now I can't stand any of that. When you're the head of the family you live fenced in, tied up. That's not for me, you know, I grew up jumping over the fence... sewing seeds all over. Listen to that song! Oh my God. My first carnival was at Cambuci, I remember it so well. I felt so great! Let's dance? Man, I can't wait to hang up my boots and come to dance here. Be the ladies' favorite... you know I'm successful in that department. I'm paying a retirement fund, you know what that is, right? - Yeah. - Well, you have to watch out. The modern world, my friend. No, let me pay this time. This bill's mine. You're cute. When you love... you should say so. You don't need to be scared. Look him straight in the eye because if you don't say it... you regret it for the rest of your life. Hi lvaro, checking out your loved one? With all due respect, she's already up there, long gone, right? Now look at Alice. There look... so pretty, are you just going to let her sit there? - Let me help you. - No, thanks. Keep your head up, go on. Let me help you. I'm leaving on my own, thank you Glson. I'm going by myself. Difficult guy, that. Very difficult. - Need any help? - No, thanks. Bye, then. Very good lvaro! That's a nice way of taking your leave! Abandoning a lady in the ballroom. After so many years of prestige, that's the image you're leaving? That it? The image you're leaving? Inelegant and cowardly. If you can go down the stairs so well... why don't you come back and dance with me? Why? Come back and dance with me. Oh my God! I love you. I love you. So very much. The whole time. I haven't felt like this for a long time. It's been wonderful dancing with you. Very special. It's made me feel very good. Very powerful memories. Moving ones, even. Sorry. Sorry. My phone number? Cell phone? I don't have one. - No? - Not yet. - Have you seen Erivelton? - He left, I think. - Didn't he leave me a note? - Let me see. No, he didn't. - Where were you? - Here. No you weren't, I've been looking all over for you. Oh I don't know, Marquinhos. Go and get your things, we're going soon. - You already packed up? - Yeah. You go ahead, I'll be right there. - Take it easy! - Where's that note she left? I know nothing about a note, you're crazy! Marquinhos! - You're crazy, man! - What's this, huh?! - Let go of him! - Get out! Hey Eudes! Eudes, you all right? I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. Don't worry about me, I'm fine. Give to your face a wash, go on. My God! This improbable man, with boyish eyes... made my body float so lightly. I felt a joy with no past nor future I'd have kissed that man whose eyes invite me to fly I'd have kissed if I knew how to make choices. But not even when the world chooses for me... and turns out the lights, to light up the moon... not even then do I dare choose that... which beats in my heart. A bunch of ugly men, they say we're hideous... but they're the hideous ones, the whole lot of them! Let's go. Bye, kisses. At the next dance, ok? Marici? - Hi. - Let's go? Let's. Slowly, no rush. - I'm so angry, furious! - Why? damn it, I know what I'm supposed to do, right? I know how to serve people... to prepare my tray, I know everything. And everyone tells me what to do, give me a break! Put one wire against the other, Bel! Go on! What's wrong? Nothing, Marquinhos. Are you all right? What's wrong? I drank too much. The old bastard got you drunk. It'll be all right. We'll go to the beach and it'll be all right. I don't want to go to the beach. Oh, I want to go home, Marquinhos. I want to go home. What? I want to go home alone! Bel! Bel! I want to go, Marquinhos! What's all this about? Bel! Bel! I bought the peanuts you like. Hey, what's up, Marici? Don't tell me you were jealous of that girl? For God's sake! You know me. You know I like people, that I like dancing. All right, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't charmed by her. But it was of the moment, just a passing thing. Look... there's poem I learned when I was young I've never forgotten it and it explains exactly what happened here. If you'd listen you'd understand. But then you'll have to stop. Because I can't remember the poem and drive at the same time. Stop, Marici. "If she walked in the garden... What smell of jasmine... As white as moonlight... I hold her so close... Defeated, now she's mine... After such dreams. " Er, "after such dreams..." Oh yeah "Why make me so sad? It wasn't her but what I wanted to embrace was... The hour of the jasmine... The aroma of the jasmine... The wave of moonlight." That was it... and I was charmed by the moment. She was a girl... sweet pure, starting out in life... but you're the woman, Marici. You know I've never met a soft talker like you. Damn you! - Bye Moraes, good night. - Bye. A lovely night. A few little problems but that's all right, happens all the time.
