This is a story torn... from the romantic and violent pages of history... a true story of two noble brothers... of the bond of sympathy that united them... and of their devotion to a just cause. Their daring adventures have been too long unremembered... and perhaps because they did not seek personal glory. But, on this bright summer day in Paris... fate is about to take a hand. No! 1, 2... Woolly bully, please shave your jaws Fromage Woolly bully, please shave your jaws Woolly bully, please shave your jaws Fromage Eggs and bacon marmalade Everybody! Woolly bully, please shave your jaws Fromage Come on, everybody! Woolly bully, please shave your jaws Fromage Eggs and bacon marmalade All right, got it! OK, Sonny. Go in there and check security. All right, E.. Come on, sit down. Coast clear. I think I'll sit... there. Monsieur Schmengoid... seafood plate. Oh, man, no wonder Elvis never toured over here. They don't speak English. Hey, how much money we make today? We made a pile today. What's a schemgy worth today? I don't know. But don't you love it, man? In America, they'd arrest us for playin' on the street. Here, they pay us to leave. That's culture, hoss. Don't you forget it. Hey, what's this? It's what you ordered. Seafood plate. Seafood plate. Get it out of here! Go on. The King's allergic. Can't eat clams unless they're attached to something. Don't forget that. Do you realize we've revolutionized rock, man? Do you know how many places... we haven't played where they won't want us? That's a revolutionary thought. Rock and roll, man. That's what's gonna change the world, you know? A lot of people think there's gonna be... a revolution? It's gonna be a music revolution. Rock and roll, man. You! You have the mark! Your arm! Your lip! You have the mark! He has the mark! You have the mark! Are you brothers? Yeah, we're the Marx Brothers. I have something so important to tell you. But first...I need money. Give her some money. It's coming... I need more money... It's coming... Give her some more money. She'll come quicker. Money, more money... OK. I'll tell you the first part. She'll tell us the first part. A long time ago, on an island far, far away... Even before their birth... the lives of the brothers were marked by irony and intrigue. Their father was a rich and powerful aristocrat... and, had it not been for a romantic indiscretion... of his passionate young wife... our heroes might have been raised as gentlemen... and we would have no story to tell. ...boiling water. Basins of it! Le chaud, le chaud! Go away! Widen it! You can see the hole! Pull... and... get the bar behind you! Pull it out... right now! Push! And push! Push! Work on it! Push! Push! Come on! It's coming. Fine! Now, pull, pull! Pull! Pull! Pull... Oh, we made it! Oh... Thank God! Now-- Oh my God! Despite the tragic loss of their fathers... Lucien and Louie, as they were called... spent a happy childhood humbly raised as peasants. Ma! Ma! Ma! Let's have it. Mine! Their humble upbringing could not disguise the fact... that these were no ordinary peasants. They betrayed their origins... by a bond of sympathy so extraordinary... that each could feel the joy or pain... of the other in his place. And as the years passed... this would prove to be a heavy load to bear. I'm going to the market. But now, you boys be good! -Yes, Nanny. -Yes, Nanny. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! You donkey! Come on. Shut up. We gotta think of a story. A dragon came by. A dragon came by, and he breathed on the house... And caught it on fire! And it caught on it fire! And then we killed it. We were gonna kill it! Yeah, we were gonna kill it... But then it flew away. It flew away! And then we killed it! And then we killed it! And we were putting out the fire... We were gonna put out the fire, and... And the gypsies stole us! Yeah, just before we... put out the fire, the gypsies stole us! And then they... and then they took us across the river. Yeah, and they killed us. No, they were gonna kill us. They were gonna kill us! They tied us up with a golden chain. But then we killed them! With a guitar. We killed them all! 'Cause they were gonna come home and kill everybody at home. They'll believe that! Let's go home. -What? -Where you going? -I'm goin' home. -Home is this way. Home's this way! Hey, you're stupid! Home's this way! Hey, you're cuckoo! It's that way! -Afraid not! -'Fraid so! Well, I'm goin' home! Home's that way, stupid! I'll be there before you. You're gonna get lost. 'Fraid not. Wait and see! La cucaracha La cucaracha Ya no quero cominar This looks like the place. Hello? Anybody home? Nanny? Hello? Where's everybody? Hello? All right, one move and you're dead! Who are you and what are you doing here? I came home. I used to live here with my brother. You're lying. I used to live here with my brother. Lucien! It's me, Luis! Don't you recognize me? I'm your brother Luis! You're lying. My brother wasn't Mexican. Look, it's me! Louie! Lucien! Where did you go? I... I got captured by gypsies. And... And... they took me to Mexico. You're lyin'. You got lost, didn't you? -I didn't get lost. -You did! The gypsies captured me. I've been living in Mexico all this time! You look great! But--but you look so... so Mexican! Well, yeah! I'm a big landowner there now. They call me Don Luis. Except for when I'm mad, they call me Crab Luis! It's a Mexican joke. You look... You look terrible. What's going on around here? Where is everybody? We've fallen into terrible times since you left, my brother. Evil men rule the country. All our people... are either dead or in jail. These evil men, they... they raped the fields and pillaged the women. That's evil men. Indeed, there were only two things... a French peasant could count on... death and taxes. And given the sometimes overzealous methods... of the tax collectors, one often preceded the other. It's good to be back in the woods. It's so peaceful. It's poison oak, my brother. Hey, brother! Hello-- You would've been dead, buddy. What are you doing? Practicing for the revolution. With a potato? But not just a potato. Look at this. Get down! What was that? A bomb de terre! In back of every murderous deed, was the evil Fuckaire. My little Poofter, eh? You must not soil your delicate little paws... with this dirty peasant, eh, Poofter? We know what he has been doing, eh? He has been stealing a log from the royal forest. He tell it is for his oven to warm his starving children. Mon dieu, if you believe that you'll believe something, eh? I know what it is for. It is to make weapons... and he should know that weapons are forbidden in my kingdom. Or, at least, the Queen's kingdom. Or so she thinks, eh? Oh, my lovely little Poofter, give me a kiss. Mon dieu! Halitosis, eh? My friend, you see we are so considerate... to you dirty peasants. We have brought your wife to join you for company. Are you sitting comfortably? You are? We can't have that. Stretch his legs wider. You ever had a taco? No, I guess they don't have tacos in France. I remember one time this restaurant... I used to work--I mean, own... they had a contest to see who could eat the most. I ate 143. And I was still hungry... but they had to close the restaurant. I'm so hungry I could eat a bowl of lard... with a hair in it. Here, puppy! I want to journey but not too fa-- Mon dieu! My God... I have been hit with shit. Allez! Vite, vite! Poofter, did you see what hap-- Poofter! My God, where is my little Poofter? Oh, I mustn't lose my Poofter! Excuse me, I am so sorry to bother you... when you are so busy, but have you seen... my Poofter? No? Oh, my God! No, no, no! Don't come back! Look for my Poofter! There's a lot of meat... on one of these little suckers, huh? Wonder if he wants any? Here, puppy! Come on! Come on. Here we go. Hey, you like it? That taste good? Guy's a vicious little dog, man, goes right for the throat, huh? What a hunter. We ought to keep him around all the time. He belongs to Fuckaire. No wonder he's so vicious. That reminds me, we'd better keep our eye out. Fuckaire's men will be out here looking for him. Hey, puppy. I'm sorry, my brother... I should have known better. Hey, don't worry. We just got their dog. What's the most they can do to us? Hey, man, this is not gonna be so bad after all. Wow, this is like a country club. Must be some of the other inmates. Hey, brother, let's not get into a gang. You know, that only complicates things. Now let's keep our noses clean, do our good time, and get out. Oh, wow, coed! Hey, this is not... gonna be so bad after all. Man, this ain't one of those prisons... where they cut your hair? Did you see that?! Un guillotine! -Easy, my brother. -What? Look at these people, they envy us. Do you want to be me? I'll trade places with you right now. We're about the same size. Hey, come on, come on, look, let's--look, I'm sorry. Hey, look, this is all a big mistake. Come on, man, we can-- we can work something out. Fuckaire! Fuckaire, we thank you... for allowing us the opportunity... to show our people how real men die. You may kill us, Fuckaire... but you will never kill the revolution. I am Corsican! I am not afraid to die. Allons! Allez, allez! Bravo, bravo. What a great pity that such noble words... should be your last words. Can I say something for a minute? I'm Mexican, and I'm afraid to die. I want to live! And we didn't do nothing to your dog. And we didn't kidnap him, man. We found him, you know. As a matter of fact, you should be thankful, man. You should be giving us a reward, you know... but we'll let it go and let bygones... be bygones. Just let it-- Be brave, my brother. Let me be the first to die for the revolution. Let him be the first to die. Sure, be the first to die. Wait a minute, they cut his head off... I'm gonna feel the pain. Wait a minute! Corsican Brothers! There he is! Arrete! Silence! My friends... you dirty--you peasants... I have decided, in my great mercy... because... I am so tender-hearted, eh? To spare the lives of these Brothers Corsican. Hope of liberation floated in the air... but even as the brothers made... their bold ascendancy to heroism... the missing pieces of their complex destiny... were now falling into place. Their manly virtues were observed... by the Queen's lovely daughters... who hid their affections... behind a veil of royal upbringing. Stop that! He's the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen in my life. I think I'm in love. I'm gonna write him a love letter. Well, all of that fresh air... has certainly given me an appetite. Petit dejeuners! These strawberries certainly look good. Mother, let the taster do his job. I never get to eat. Sis, help me, what should I say? What a pity, you missed the end. Three such delightful executions! Such blood, such vomit. You enjoying your breakfast-- I see you've... you've not eaten your strawberries? I got them for you specially. There are so good for you. For him, they are not so good. He's allergic to strawberries. We all know what you're doing. We're not blind. Yes, I know what you mean. Believe me, l, too, am disappointed... that I had to spare the lives of these... Corsican Brothers. Nothing more I wanted than their deaths. But, you see, they seem so popular... with the crowd. But don't worry. I have something in store for them. Will make the guillotine look like child's play. You're disgusting! Vile! Horrible! Cruel! Perverted! Perverted! Perverted! That is the one I wanted to hear. You've made my day. Perverted! My God, it's nice to know you're appreciated. Believe me, if you weren't a woman... I could kiss you for that. Don't be a stupid, Fuckaire! Excuse me. I'm still hungry. Bring me some eggs! Is it ready? Yes, sir. The oil is nice and hot, eh? Yes, sir. Let's see. Keep your finger still, you fool. How else can I read it? Oh, yes, 230 degrees... Centigrade. That's quite hot. Make it hotter! My friend. Now, my dirty little peasant... are you enjoying my hospitality? Yes, it's my favorite room. You know, I've got a surprise for you. -For me? -Yes... but you must do something for me first. Now, I want you to entertain... your fellow prisoners down here, eh? Because they have no entertainment. So, I want you to stand over here... and entertain your prisoners in this exact spot. It has to be exact, you see... because of the light on your face, eh? Now, you'll entertain your prisoners... and then I'm going to give it to you. You're going to have a surprise. Hey, what kind of a surprise is it? Is it something you can eat? If you like greasy food, yes, you can eat it. Now just stand here... and please entertain your fellow prisoners. What do you want me to do? Sing or dance or tell a joke? It doesn't matter. Entertain means... you do all kinds of things, yes. So, you are going to sing and dance... anything, but you must stay in this spot... and do it quickly while it's still hot. Now, give me a chance to get clear. Can it be a dirty song? Yes, sir, a dirty prison song for these dirty prisoners... Come on, sing! Sing this song. And for God's sake, make sure you're in... the right place for the light. Now sing, sing, sing. Can I have a guitar? I can really get into it... -if I had a guitar. -You don't need a guitar, no. You can accompany yourself with your mustache, yes. Now, come on, sing your dirty prison song. Now, come on, sing, please. Sing it. Sing it, please! Hey, I know another song that's even-- You are a bloody imbecile! All I'm asking you to do is to stand on this spot... and sing a song, any song. It's hot! Oh, my God, it's everywhere! In every orifice! Such a beautiful song, Fuckaire. You should teach us the words. I'm over here, my brother, over here! My brother, over here! Easy, easy, my brother, easy, easy! Here it is. Here's your lovely drinking water. Here, what are you doing? Get off my bucket, will you? Get off it! What are you sitting on that for? Guards! Guards! He's done a whoopsy in my water. Now I can't use it. I'll have to go and get some more now. Listen. The horses are in the stable. Meet me the inn in the village. Now go, go! Hey, over here, fella! Get a horse, go to town. Who wants to go to town? Hey, come on, we're going to town, big fella... to get a drink. You don't have to go to town! Just sit there and be cool. Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you. Why do they gotta make these horses so big? God, look at this one. It's an elephant. Want some peanuts? Nice horse. I need a nice, little, small mid-size. Maybe a little burro with a saddle already on it. What have you been eating? I like horses. I like 'em medium rare with potatoes. Hi, puppy. Hi, puppy. Want to go to town? Oh, hey, you're nice. Good idea. I'll be right back. Hold on. You got my note! And I didn't even send it. Hey, you! What are you doing in here? You're not supposed to be in here. Don't hide from me, I see you. You know, you'd be in a lot of trouble... if someone else had found you. Lucky I found you first. Stand still! Ja, let me have a look at you. You know, I've been looking for a stud like you. You've got a great ass. You're gorgeous! I can't wait. You know what? Tomorrow morning, I'm going to sneak out... and I'm going to take you for a long ride. I'm going to ride you till you drop... then I'm going to find a nice lake... then I'm going to bathe you and massage you. You'd like that, wouldn't you? And then I'm going to put something on you... to keep those horrible flies off you. Go, quickly! Wait, my hanky! Whoa, puppy! Slow down! Stop! El stoppo! I forgot my hand. Here, take this. Hurry, quick, go! You must go now! Deux, trois! It's OK, my brother. Make a run for it. I'll hold 'em off! What? My brother, wait, wait! You're lucky, buddy. If this had a point on it, you would've been dead. Wait, these are my friends! We've been having a drinking contest. Look at all the money I've won. It's OK. He's my brother! Yeah, it's OK. Sit down, my brother. I was worried about you. Where did you go? I went home. I knew you'd be in trouble... so I went home and got me a sword. Thanks for thinking of me, my brother. Well, come on, have a drink. I never touch the stuff... and I wish you wouldn't, either. 'Cause you're my brother! You're my brother. I love you, you know that? And I love you. Anything I got is yours, you know? I wanted you to know that. And everything you have is yours. Do you understand? Right, my brother. That's mine. Smells like horses. Where'd you get this? A very beautiful lady gave that to me tonight, my brother. She saw me in the barn... and fell instantly in love with me. Poor girl. You're lying! 'Cause the most gorgeous girl you've ever seen in my life... gave me this. She's so gorgeous. And she kissed me. Well, my brother... I hate to hurt your feelings. She may have kissed you, but she's in love with me. She told me we're going riding tomorrow. You're lying! Don't you ever talk... about the woman I love like that. Stand up! Now, she's my girl. You got that?! You're right. She's your girl. Don't you say that. She's my girl! Don't say she's my girl. You're right. She's not your girl... she's my girl. En garde! A vous! Hey, come on, this is stupid now. Come on! Hey, come on, I don't want to hurt you. You'll never get close to me. Come on, let's fight. I'm not gonna fight you! Don't embarrass me in front of your friends. I'm not gonna embarrass you-- That hurts, stupid! Give me that. Give me that! Give me that! There she is. Look, there she is! -There's two of 'em! -There's two of 'em. I'm finished. Oh, you do that so good! Oh, you like that, huh? I've never had anybody do that for me. Do you think you could do it again? Again? Just a little, unless you are tired. I'm not tired. Good! I could do this all day. As a matter fact... that's what I used to do for a living. I worked for a guy-- I mean, I owned... a big horse ranch in Mexico. -Really? -Oh, yeah. We had 10,000 horses. 10,000? Oh, yeah, sure. What kind of horses? They were brown, mostly brown. Did you do all the breeding yourself? No. We had a horse for that. I remember one time my cousin though-- Never mind. You know, I can't imagine being with anyone... but someone that was into horses. You just gotta know how to treat horses, you know? I mean, a lot of 'em like to be treated... you know, just, like, really gentle-- What's that?! Sorry. It's just my sword. It keeps getting in the way. Would you like to see it? It's OK, because I couldn't show it to you anyway. My father always told me... never show your sword unless you intend to use it. Anyway, mine's broken. -Broken? -Yeah. Why, I've mistreated it for years. So foolish. I used to go around stickin' it into everything. Stuck it into watermelons... just practicing. One day I stuck it into the dirt... broke the tip off. How awful. That really hurt me. But that's OK. I'm gonna get a new one. You can get new ones? That's why I have to get into the castle... because that's where they keep the good ones. Yes! I need a good, strong one this time. Francois has a really good one! But it has to be big. Oh...Pierre. Yes. But his is too big. They can never be too big... not if you know what to do with it. You see, sometimes if they're big enough... all you have to do is show it, and people will run. That's what I did. I think he really likes you. Nice horsy. I love horses. They're really nice. I got it. I figured out a way... for us to get into the castle. Good. How? See this guy over there? The guy in the red? No. The guy over there. What, the cook? No, not the cook. The guy over there. What, the guy with the horse? We steal a horse? No, not that guy. The guy over there! What, the guy in the red? That guy, right there! That's the famous Marquis du Hickey. Legendary lover. Makes Casanova look like a schoolboy. He's a tri-sexual. A tri-sexual? Yeah, he'll try anything-- mud, chickens, anything. We don't have time for that, my brother. We have to get into the castle. It's important. That's what I'm getting at. Now, listen. Tomorrow he's going to the castle... for the Queen's birthday with his entire entourage. We go in with him. But we'll be recognized. I got that figured out, too. -See this guy behind us? -Yeah. -The guy with the red hair? -Yeah. He's the Queen's hairdresser, on royal appointment. He's a Spanish guy. Just came from Spain. And anyways, he's queer as a duck. Oh, no, my brother. I-- I just couldn't do that. I mean I haven't really been with a woman... Iet alone a man. I wouldn't know what to do. Just listen. See the other guy with him? That's Nostradamus, the famous mystic seer. Now, I'm gonna lure him outside... and then you come after us. My brother, I can't. -I just couldn't. -Why? Just the thought of it makes me sick. I mean, what does he do, kiss first? I just couldn't. The thought... Look, I'm gonna lure them outside... and you come after me! And then what? And then you bonk 'em on the head! I can bonk. But how are you gonna lure 'em outside? I have my ways. Con permiso. Tickle your ass with a feather? Monsieur Jozay. It's pronounced Jose. Gracias. !Ay, reina! I am so happy to know you! Thank you for inviting us. It's such a nice casa you have here. Who do your hair? It's OK. I'm going to fix it. Gracias por la invitacion. It's me. I'll meet you later. I've got to see you. Gracias por todo. Gracias. My darling, I got your message about meeting later, eh? Monsieur Nostradamus. The brothers were not masters of impersonation... but the strength of their resolve... made up for it, and they soon found themselves... comfortably situated in the palace... at ease with their aristocratic enemies. They knew how readily the princesses... would throw themselves in the path of love... if given the chance. But even that temptation did not spoil the supreme poise... with which they carried off the masquerade. I'm so glad you're here. I am so glad I'm here, too. This is so much fun. OK, we're gonna turn you around. All right. See, like that. There you go. Now, tell me. What is it like in Spain? Well, honey, that's the end of the world. You want to talk about the end of the world... that's the end of the world. It's so hot there. Is it true what they say about the Queen of Spain? I don't know. What they say? That she's bald? She bald? She--honey, she got more hair... on her legs than she got on her head. And what about all those lovers? God. They don't call her the "Frijole" for nothing. She like a doorknob. Everybody gets a turn. And that's a yoke, huh? A good yoke. Yeah, they were gonna name a port of entry after her. Greetings, my peasant brothers. I bring good news. The revolution goes well. Soon I will be able to free you from your miserable existence. Take heed, have faith, and au revoir. Can I ask you a personal question? Surely. Where your daughter's room is? Oh, my daughters. They're so lovely! They're just like their father. Whatever happened to the King? I don't see him around here never no times. Well, one day he want hunting with the Fuckaire... and then he never came home again. I don't trust that Fuckaire. He's a sneaky guy. Well...you have to trust someone. It's hard being the Queen. I know what you mean... especially in these pants. Clear in his purpose. Lucien searched for a weapon strong enough... and big enough to intimidate friend and foe alike. I not lying to you. That's the truth. They were so big that she thought... nobody would notice them. She would just put a dress on. Nobody would notice them. !Ay! She was so stupid. And she didn't tip at all. How that feel? That's OK on you, the hot air? Yeah. Feels like a night in Malaga, huh? A nice hot blow job. !Ay, que bueno! I want to look nice... for my...rendezvous with du Hickey. Oh, you're gonna look special, honey. You're gonna look like you never looked before. Now, you just relax and go to sleep. I give you a little massage, OK? Now, just be quiet and go to sleep. My darling. I've been looking all over-- God! I wish he would be careful! Sorry. God, you scared the shit out of me. Oh, what have you done? I didn't do nothin', man. I was washin' her hair, and it all came out. You've made her look bad. That's good. It's a small victory, but a big one. My God! Why didn't you tell me I look like this? I look like Fuckaire. No wonder my peasant brothers won't talk to me. Oh, who cares if you look like Fuckaire? Help me do her hair. I have to get out of this disguise. Come on. Hurry up, and let's get outta here. I found them, my brother, and they're beautiful. Oh, good. Hey, and stop walking into walls. You almost broke my nose that time. They're just down the hall from here. Good. Leave her alone. Let's go. Adios. Wait till you see them, my brother. There's one pair that's just incredible. What are you talkin' about? Come here. They're in here. There they are. Now, if we can just get them off. Let's get 'em drunk first. Hi, ladies. This-- this is more like it. Hey. How you doin'? Do I pass inspection? Hey, did you ever see a one-eyed trouser snake? Must be melon season. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. Hey, come here! Come here. We've been lookin' for you! Hey, come here. No, no, come here! -Wait! Wait! -Hey, wait! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We... we want to talk to you. Hey, I can explain! Wait! Wait! !La cholita! Where are you? Come on, baby, I know you're in there. Come on, baby, don't play hard to get. I know you want me. Hey, I want you, too. Why do you think I'm dressed like this? Hey, baby. Excuse me, sister. Come on, honey. Those girls don't mean anything to me. Ever since you gave me that look this morning... I don't even think of girls. All I think of is you. I thi-- Come on, baby. I can take you away from all this... civilization. We can run out into the jungles of Mexico... and be love savages. I'll be your king... and you be my love queen. We can open a taco stand. Just...tell me where you are, little pussycat. Come on, baby. Oh, honey... you make me so happy. Oh...oh, I want you. I need you. I have to have you. And so you shall, my darling. Get away from me! I don't like intellectuals. They're too stupid. Don't be afraid. I'm not an intellectual. I'm a revolutionary. Don't you know who I am? Oh. It's you! Well, then what were you doing... in that room with all those girls? I was just looking for my sword. They had your sword?! Yes. They were holding it for me. -They were holding it? -Yes. You told me that was my job! My darling... Listen to me. I've been searching all over for you. Listen, I just want to tell you... What's wrong with you? Nothing. I've got so much to tell you. Now, listen. Listen close. You're not screaming. Why don't you s-- why don't you scream?! That don't hurt. You think that hurt? That don't hurt. Come on, let me down from here. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm not supposed to be doing this. I'm Catholic. This is worse than the lnquisition. My God, I'm gonna make you scream. Come on, let me down from here. Ah, this one is going to hurt, by God! Strong men have died before now with this one. This is Montezuma's revenge, eh? That's strange. Is something wrong? Having fun? Come on, let me down from here. I'm getting tired from this. You've--you've got bad circulation. We're gonna try it upside-down. Hey, come on. I gotta go to the bathroom. Now, let me down from here. Well, this will stop you going to the bathroom. Don't worry. Now, my God... you're going to feel it this time. Oh, my God. Why don't you scream? If you don't let me down from here... I'm going to give you such a scream. Now, let me down! C'est Fuckaire. He has my brother. It's getting cold in here. You got a blanket or something? My God! He's inhuman! He's going to be the death of me... and I'm not even going to enjoy it. My brother... my brother's in trouble. Don't you ever want to scream, "I'm burning! I'm--" What took you so long, my brother? Get away from him! He's mine! I hit you, and he screams? Nostradamus, join the party. We need some new blood. So glad to see you. You kissed me! You got the whip? It's my turn. Come, quick! What took you so long? Are you all right, my brother? Fix my feet. Would you do my ankles, please? I like the ankle straps with shoes. Thank you. Could you please do the other one? You're so kind. Yes, that's it. Nice and tight. That's beautiful. Beautiful. Now...whip me! Whip you? Oh, yeah, sure. I'll whip you. No, my brother. We don't have time. Of course you have time. We must go free my people. Free your people? You got another party? They're tied up somewhere else? I'll join the other party, but don't go! Please! No! Whip me! You can have a quick whip-round. Please! Guards! Guards! Stop them! They're escaping! They haven't whipped me! Guards! Where are those guards? There's no guards, man. Come on. Let's go. No, we must fight our way out of this. We must fight our way to freedom. We can't fight here. Come on. You're right. We can't fight here. Not here. Fight down here. Right here. This is the place to fight. This way, our back is protected. What are you talking about? Let's get out of here! Come on. There's nobody here. Guards! Get out here and fight! Come on! Get out here, you cowards! Go back, back, back! It's a mistake! Come, come! No, don't run! Come back and fight! No, run! Go back to sleep. Come, fight! Come on, you cowards! Let's fight! No, let's not fight. Let's kiss. Go back. There they are. Please, my darling. Go back. I've been looking all over for you. Don't hurt her. Don't hurt her. How charming. We give up. Back! Back! You call yourselves guards? So, my friends. We have caught you, eh? And you wouldn't beat me, eh? So, now I'm going to whip you to death. You may whip us, Fuckaire... but you'll never beat us. Corsican Brothers! My friends, at last you must learn... Ne fuc pas avec moi! To the dungeons with them! Don't worry, my brother. They can't stop men who want to be free. Oh, mother! Your hair! I told you never to call me "Mother." Yes, I can see it, my brother. What is it? I can see the Big Dipper. Big Dipper? Yes, I can, and I can see Venus... and I can see the moon. All I see is Uranus. It's out there, my brother. Yes. We're in luck... because if that's the Big Dipper... That means the North Star is-- Let's see. You take the bottom star from the cup... and you align it with the handle. You know what I see? I see a big idiot standing in front of me. Why do we always gotta stay and fight? Why couldn't we escape when we had the chance? My brother, there are some things... that you cannot run away from. If this revolution is to survive... men like me must fight. Even though the cause is hopeless... we must fight to free our brothers... from the chains of oppression. What brothers are you talkin' about? The only brothers I see around here is me... and all you do is get us caught! Did you ever stop to think that maybe you're the only guy... in the revolution? You know, like, where's your followers, huh? Hey. Would you follow this guy into a revolution? Of course not, 'cause you got half a brain. So, who's following him? I've got an idea. Quick. Take off your clothes. Hey, wait a minute. We're brothers. Look, take off your clothes. Hey, you haven't been in jail that long. This should be enough rope. Look, if we're gonna hang ourselves... Iet me be the first to go. I'm tired and hungry... and now I'm cold, too. Just think of a way to get through those bars. Hey! Watch out up there! It's amazing. This French bread gets stale, it gets as hard as a rock. So what? You know? This just might be the tool we've been looking for. I think I can get through now, my brother. I did it. Quick. Throw me the rope. Hold on tight, my brother. I smell freedom. I smell-- I smell food. I must be imagining things. Chicken. Wait! But Lucien was not a man to forget his brother. He remembered how they had loved and cherished each other... through the long years of separation... how deeply the fate of one had always affected the other... and his loyalty strengthened his heroic resolve. And so, for his beloved brother Louie... Lucien prepared to draw together his peasant followers... and bring an end to oppression forever. Come here, my brothers. The time has come. Listen to me. We have been living like miserable dogs long enough! We must fight to take back what is ours! We must tear down this miserable government... and replace it with our own people! Are you with me?! I said, are you with me?! All right. Let's organize and fight! Enough! Now, today is a special occasion. Today, we have the 5,000th execution this month, eh? I'm very grateful to all you dirty peasants... for putting your heads together... to increase productivity. And for this special occasion, we have a special execution. None other than that disgusting, driveling... dirty peasant, the Corsican Brother. Perhaps, you dirty peasant, you would like to say a last word. Fuckaire! The only thing I want to say... is you've kept me in a dungeon... and you beat me, and you tortured me... and you even kissed me. And I want these people to know... the only thing you've really done... is made me really, really hungry... and that's not nice to do to a Mexican. I'm supposed to get a last meal! I never got a last meal! I'd even eat French food! Thank you for those kind words. It's nice to know we have another satisfied customer. Look. There's ants in that basket. My only regret on this wonderful afternoon... is that the other Corsican Brother... the revolutionary, is already dead. Nothing would give me greater pleasure... than he should witness the death of his dirty-- Fuckaire! It must be merde a la tete. The dead Corsican. I accept your invitation! His dirty brother shall not escape. Execute him! You dirty peasants! Don't touch me! Keep away! Don't--don't touch me! You can kick me if you like, but don't touch me! How dare you? We're just about to get to the part... where we laugh and laugh! I've had enough. En garde! Take the other one. This one is mine! I've got you! I got you! No! Oh, to be sure. Fuckaire. There you are, eh? You're finished. So, you Corsican dog... you trouble-maker, why couldn't you let me kill you quietly in the guillotine, eh? No, you have to make revolutionary speeches. You turned my beloved dirty peasants against me! One more execution--that was all I needed for the record. You spoiled my fun! Well, my friend... from now on you will find I am no longer Mr. Nice Guy. Look at that! Look at this! Can I have it? Very good. That's wonderful! So, anyway, the princess says... "ls that a wart in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me?" So it came to pass... that France was delivered from tyranny... and emerged into a new age of freedom. The evil Fuckaire had perished, as was just. And of Lucien and Louie, it may be fairly said... that theirs was a most special destiny. If I could be the one you love If you would let this dream come true Then I would ask for nothing more But to live life loving you I'm so excited. I've never been married before. Don't do that. I'm gonna get pregnant right away! How long is this going to take? I have a riding lesson. Where is that brother of yours, anyways? Boy, his swinging days are over. I'm going to cut his rope right off! I think I need a drink. Wait. You can just wait. Back. You're just going to have to train him. Yes. We'll go to the opera, the ballet... to the theater. I'll have him take dancing and singing and elocution. I'm going to change the way he walks... the way he talks, the way he eats... his clothes, his pants, his jacket, his hair... Oh, I have lots of work to do. Yes, we'll go shopping, go to Paris... visit his mother... Hey, Louie. Let's get out of here! And so the Corsican Brothers escaped... from the pages of history. Thanks, brother. Let's go to America and start a revolution. All right. I'm with you. 1, 2... As I got on the city bus and found a vacant seat I thought I saw my future bride Walking down the street I shouted to the driver Hey, conductor, you must slow down I think I see her, please let me off this bus Nadine Honey, is that you? Oh, Nadine Honey, is that you? Seems like every time I catch up with you You got something else to do I saw her from the corner And she turned and doubled back She was stepping towards a coffee-colored Cadillac Moving through the crowd Trying to get to where she's at I was campaign-shouting like a southern diplomat Oh, Nadine Honey, is that you? Oh, Nadine Baby, where are you? Seems like every time I catch up with you You got something else to do Downtown looking for her Looking all around Saw her get into a yellow cab and take her to town Caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab Tipped a $20 bill, told him, "Catch that yellow cab" Oh, Nadine Honey, is that you? Oh, Nadine Baby, is that you? Seems like every time I catch up with you You got something else to do Hey, baby, I'm OK. Take it, Chong! Well, she moves around like a wayward summer breeze Go, go on, driver, go on, catch her for me, please Moving through the traffic like a modern cavalier Leaning out that taxi window Trying to get that girl to hear Oh, Nadine Honey, is that you? Oh, Nadine Oh, baby, is that you? Seems like every time I catch up with you You got something else to do Seems like every time I catch up with you You got something else to do Nadine! Baby, is that you?
