Look at this view. I know, right? Wow. I had forgotten how beautiful this house is. You can see the ocean from here. Hey, quick. Turn her around from the window. What's wrong with her? I think she's just having a nightmare. Faye, are you all right? She doesn't look good. It's just a reaction to the sedative I've given her. She's a little disoriented right now. So why'd you give her something so strong? Because it took us an hour and a half to get here. Did you really want me to risk her waking up in the middle of our trip? How are you doing? Faye? Are you okay? Remember this house, dear? Remember we talked about this place for months? About coming here so that you continue your therapy from inside the safety of your house. I think she's ready. Not yet. She still seems very disoriented. This was an awful idea. How could you agree to this, Tom? Faye wanted this. I'm here. I'm in the room. How are you feeling? My head is pounding. I'm so sorry. That's just a side effect from the sedative I've given you. Are you okay? Do you remember this house, honey? - Vaguely. - Where are you? My father's house. And why are you here? I'm here to get better. Are you ready to take a look at the view outside? No, I don't think I'm ready yet. Faye, you can do this. Just remember the breathing exercises. You're going to breathe in through your nose... for a count of five, and then breathe out through your mouth. Five again. Now, it's okay. Get ready to turn her around. Come on, Faye, you can do it. There we go. There we go. Come on. That's it. That's it, baby girl. You see? You see? You're only a few feet from the glass. You're safe now. Nothing bad is going to happen to you. How long is this going to last? She's doing good. Right, babe? Right, babe? - No! - Turn her back around. Turn her around. You did so good. I'm proud of you, baby. I need a drink. There's a bottle of vodka in the kitchen. I don't know how old it is though. Vodka doesn't go bad, right? Come on, Faye. Show me the rest of your new house. So what kind of draconian treatment is this? It's called cognitive behavioral treatment and exposure therapy. You're causing her anxiety on purpose. It's one of the known cures for agoraphobia. This can be my bedroom when I stay over. Ah, look at the view from up here. And you listened to this quack? Faye and I both decided that this place would be the ideal place to continue her therapy. Here she can be closer to the outside world. Ugh! I'm definitely getting a new mattress. I refuse to sleep where my father slept with that witch all those years. You can afford a whole new set. Her father dying and leaving her this place might be the best thing he ever did for her. The only thing, considering he locked her up in a boarding school. Being in this house might reverse all those years of neglect. Yeah. Oh, my God. I think this closet is bigger than my entire condo. What happened? The door just closed by itself. It's probably a draft. Wow, look at this bathroom! But all the windows are closed. What I'd give to get a listing like this. Uh... Commission on our condo not good enough? I have a surprise. A surprise? I thought you didn't want any pets. I rescued him right before they... you know. Who would want to put this beautiful little guy to sleep? Thank you so much. You're welcome. He'll keep you company when I'm at work. He's a big guy. Hey, Dr. Murphy and Margie are leaving. I have to go. They're my ride back. Call me if you need anything, all right? I'll be fine. Welcome home, my beautiful wife. I'm gonna get better here. I'm going to go see them off. - Tell them I say "bye." - All right. Hi! You come up with a name for him yet? Hamlet, like my favorite character. Seriously? A crazy, suicidal guy? Yeah, it's fitting, don't you think? Really? You're gonna work right now? I didn't want to tell you until I was sure. What? The case I'm working on, it's going to trial, and they want me to lead the trial team. That's great. Yeah, it's a great opportunity for me, especially if I want to make partner. What's wrong? What aren't you telling me? Well, the trial would be held at the downtown courthouse. If I take the case, I can't come home every night. And leave me here by myself? No, we can get Stephanie to stay with you. No, absolutely not. I'm sick of being a burden to her. I'll find somebody else to come stay with you. A complete stranger? Somebody to just help you take care of this place while I'm gone. You'll have time to work on your dissertation. Okay, fine. I'll tell 'em I can't take the case. Wait... If it's important to you... Are you sure? Yes. Hey, little guy, what are you looking at? Hamlet, not everything is a toy. You better behave. We don't want this lady thinking we're crazy. Come on. Did Tom explain about Faye's condition? He told me she's afraid to go outside. Good. Then I don't have to go into all that. I hope Stephanie is not scaring you away. No, your husband had already filled me in. And you still want to take the job? Are we paying her more than I thought? Better than any other jobs around here. Reception here is crap, and I need to call someone back on one of my listings. The only phone that works is in my father's old office. - Just one phone? - I know. They're installing more next week. Okay, I gotta use the little girls' room first. Yeah, use the guest bathroom upstairs. - I just put fresh towels in there. - Awesome. Um, let me show you around, yeah? - Sure, yeah. - Come on. So this is the kitchen. This is such a pretty house. Oh, thank you. I don't mean to be nosey, but how did you meet your husband if you never go out? I have been going to bars for years, and I still haven't met anybody worth my time. Tom actually worked as a clerk at the attorney's office that represented my father. And one day, he was asked to bring me my monthly allowance because they couldn't get a courier. And he just showed up at your door? And then he volunteered to keep bringing it every month after that... Come on. I'll show you upstairs. And this is our room. And down there is the master bath. Wow... this is a lot of cleaning. Well, most of the rooms won't be used, so you'll only have to clean them once in a while. My God, look at this view. I'm sorry, I forgot. It's okay. I'll try really hard to remember from now on, I promise. Really, it's okay. Oh, um, by the way I'm going to be having a mattress delivered tomorrow, so I need you to open the door for the delivery guy. That's easy enough. This is a huge bathroom. Oh, I'll take care of this. I thought I laid these out. I have to go. I called my office, and I have to put out some fires. Did you put the bathroom mats back in this box? I haven't been in here. That's so weird. I could have sworn that I... Never mind. I'm gonna miss you so much. I will come to see you all the time. All right. I have to go. - Okay. - Bye. Oh, um, sorry, make yourself at home. I'll just be in the office working on my dissertation. Dissertation? Yeah, I'm trying to get my PhD. Cool. In what? Uh, psychology. I want to be able to eventually help others who are suffering from my condition. Right. I'll go to my car and get my stuff and move them inside. - Where is she? - Excuse me. Where's that little hermit? Is she expecting you? She isn't expecting this. Elizabeth, what a surprise! If you think you can get away with this, you're dead wrong. This is my house! I think you're suffering from misplaced anger. It's my dad that you're really mad at. Don't give me your psycho-babble bullshit. I was practically married to your father. And yet all he left you was the condo, and he left me everything else. All you ever did was try yo make him feel guilty about being with me. Please. He could've cared less about what I thought. You just must have done something really wrong that made him not wanna give you anything else in his will. I treated your father like a king. Better than that whore of a mother of yours ever did. Leave my mother out of this. She never cared about either one of you. She left and never looked back. Yeah, right when you showed up. You pushed her away so that you could be with him. You're just as crazy as she is. Okay. You need to go before I call the police. You're going to regret this. This is my house, and I will get it back. Now! I am so sorry I let her in. I had no idea who she was. Don't worry. It's not your fault. I bet you didn't realize you were gonna be playing the role of a bouncer, did you? But you shouldn't even let her get to you anyway. She's obviously trash. Nina, is that you? Tom, are you home? The doctor just left, but I can call him back. You've lost a lot of blood, Faye. I'm not going to any hospital. How long did you know? I didn't. Come on, how could you not have known? My cycle has always been a little messed up. We have to be more careful. What? Or not be careful at all. We've been married for three years, maybe it's a sign that we should start trying. What? Are you cra...? Faye, you are in no condition to be having a baby right now. I'll have Nina to help me. Be rational, come on. What is so irrational about wanting the life that everyone else has? Of course, it's normal that you want a baby. It's just that in your condition, you can't be having any kids right now. As soon as you get better, I promise we'll have one, two... three, however many you want. That's what we came here for. Come on, Hamlet. It's time for our therapy. I can do this, baby. One day, I'm gonna walk right through those doors. And you're gonna come with me, okay? This is going to be harder than I thought. Tom told me what happened last night. He shouldn't have told you that. You should have gone to the hospital. It wasn't that serious. He said it was a lot of blood. It just seemed that way, because I was in a bathtub when it happened. Tell me the truth. You knew you were pregnant. You just didn't want Tom to know until it was too late to do something about it. No. No, I swear I had no idea, but... But, now, um... What? Now I want to have a baby so badly. It's... It's just given me so much more resolve to get better soon. Oh, that's great. Hey, I've been doing this thing where I get a little closer to the door every day, and sometimes I'll bring Hamlet with me. It's really weird, but he's actually been helping me a lot. The cat? How much more inspiration do you need to go outside than to look at this beautiful view? I mean I can see how the city might be scary, but... what can possibly go wrong here? I can't really explain. Maybe what you need to do is just run out. One quick dash across the door, and you'd be free. Come on, Faye, try it. It's like what the doctor said. What are you doing? Exposure therapy. No! Stop! I know you're scared now... No! Stop! Stop! Stop! No! No! No! No! What's going on? Close the door. I'm so sorry, I'm sorry. I was trying to help you. Should I call her doctor? You want us to call Dr. Murphy? Just lie down on the couch and take a little nap. You'll be fine. - Why would you do that? - Is she gonna be okay? Just let her sleep. She'll be just fine. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. I'm sorry. Oh, hi, baby. Are you afraid of the storm? Is there anything else you want to tell me about what happened tonight? What happened? She's fine. She just got a little startled, that's all. Are you okay? Apparently somebody broke into the house while your wife was sleeping. Um, do you need me anymore tonight? No, not really. Thank you. I'm calling an alarm company right now. I'll be back. All right, here's my number. Call me if you think of anything else. All right? Did you know my father? Not really. We rarely saw him around here. Yeah, we were kind of surprised when we found out he had passed away here. Here? Like in this house? I thought you knew. The cleaning lady called it in. Do you know how he died? According to the medical examiner he had a heart attack. Could someone have killed him and made it look like a heart attack? No, there was no sign of foul play. Look, I know about your condition. My late wife, she had bipolar disorder. She felt alone in this world, because people couldn't understand why she just couldn't get over it. Your late wife? What happened to her? She overdosed on some pills one night. I'm so sorry. I did understand what she was going through so if you need someone to talk to, do call me all right? I called the company that does the security in my building at work, and they're gonna come to install an alarm tomorrow. Oh, great. All right, I'm done here. You have my number. Call me if you need anything. - Thank you. - I'll keep in touch. I forgot to tell you. Elizabeth is disputing the will. Can she even do that? Yeah, but don't worry. I'll take care of her. Nothing that witch does even bothers me anymore, but... But what? I need you here with me. I don't feel safe here alone. I know, baby, give it some time. The trial will be over in a couple weeks, and I'll be here more. I was thinking. My father left me all that money. There's no reason for you to work ever again. Babe, that's your money, not mine. You're my husband. It's our money. You want me to be a kept man the rest of my life? No, you can help me run my father's business. I don't know anything about your father's business. I'm an attorney. Exactly, stressing yourself out to eventually make partner, - and then what? - You know what. Yeah, more stress and more hours. Why don't you just retire and go fishing every day? And buy a boat. It could be outside, right out back, right behind our house. Come on, isn't that what everyone dreams of, retiring early? No, not me. Babe, give it some time. You're going to do so much better now that you're here. Now, what's really bothering you? I know you and something's up. I think my father's ghost is haunting this house. Where are you going? I have court in the morning. If I'm going to be there on time, I have to be up at five a.m. Faye. The alarm guy is here. He wants to show us how the system works. Hey, Nina. Did you move my shoes last night after I went to sleep? What shoes? Uh, my sandals. Stephanie put them next to the couch, and I can't find them now. I can help you look for them. I'm sure they're somewhere around here. Okay. There's nothing to be afraid of. You know, many patients that are undergoing your medical treatment have experienced similar symptoms: Forgetfulness, anxiety... even paranoia. It's not the medication. The first time it happened, I could say that I had imagined the thing with the bath mats, but my shoes... I found them on the shoe rack in my closet upstairs. What's so strange about that? I hadn't been upstairs since the morning. There's no way I wouldn't have remembered walking around barefoot all day. So you mean that there's ghosts in the house? Since I got here, I've felt like something or someone is just around me. Look... You're undergoing a lot of stress these days. What with your father's death... moving into a new house, Tom's absence due to his workload. You know what? I'm going to prescribe a new medication for you. I don't need more meds. I'm getting so much better. I'm doing the breathing and the exposure therapy. Every day I'm getting a little closer to the glass doors. Agoraphobia is just a symptom of the underlying panic disorder. How is your dissertation going? I haven't really had much time to... work on it since I've been here. Well, that's understandable, but you can't let it get too far away. I won't. You know how important that is to me. I'm afraid time's up for today. Doctor Murphy... I'm not imagining things. I swear. Faye, I know it's tricky for you... but you have to fight for your recovery. Are you going to be okay until I see you next week? Nina? Nina, can you turn that down a little bit? Nina, is that you? Nina, come out, please. Hey. There's nothing there. What about that song that was playing? - What about it? - It was my father's favorite. Then it makes perfect sense for it to still be on the turntable. It was playing by itself. Maybe the cat jumped up there and turned it on. No, the door was locked. - Then, how did you get in? - It opened by itself. Babe, your dad's ghost is not haunting you. I don't know. A lot of weird things have been happening in this place. You're just still getting used to the new house. I don't want to get used to it. I want to leave here. - And go where? - Back to our condo. We can't. It's already under contract. Okay, then we'll go somewhere else. Anywhere else. I just don't want to be here. I'm afraid of this place. Babe, you need to relax. Come on. Let's go get some medicine and take a nap. Okay. Where were you? I went to take the stuff in the den to storage. And Nina? She said she didn't do it, Faye. I want you to fire her right now. I can't fire her, Faye. Who's gonna take care of you? - You. - We've already been over that. Okay, well, then someone else. You have no idea how hard it was to find her. She's the reason I can't find Hamlet. I don't want her here. Please, Faye, you got to work with me. The trial will be over in another week. Then, I'll take a vacation and find someone else. I promise. And leave here again with her? It's just for another week. What am I gonna do without Hamlet? He's a cat. He'll find his way home. They always do. Come here. Oh, I didn't know you were in here. I'm just getting dinner ready. Can I get you something? No, I'm just getting a drink. I'm so sorry that cat got out. I can take a walk tomorrow morning and see if I find him for you. Thanks. What is that? What's wrong? I'm just making beef stew. See? What did you do with Hamlet? Tom! Tom! Tom! Tom, come here, please! Coming. - Tom, hurry! - What? I told you she did it. She killed Hamlet. I saw all the blood. She must have changed her apron, but I saw his collar in the stew, and all of his blood... - What is she talking about? - I don't know. I'm just making beef stew. It's not beef. I saw his collar in there! Faye, Faye, what is wrong? You're not making any sense. No, no, I saw his collar. Are you okay? Get her pills. Come on, let's go upstairs. I mean, I just don't know how much longer I can keep doing this. She's totally losing it. Right. Listen, I'll call you back. I'm busy. Let me out of here! Faye! Faye, please let me out of here! Nina, what's wrong? Faye, let me out please! I think it's locked from your side! No, there's no lock on this side! Please, Faye! The crime scene techs and I are done in there, unless you have anything you need to tell me. Excuse me for a second, Detective. I gotta use the phone really quick. Sure, go ahead. Is there anything you have to tell me? You know you can trust me, right? Does it have to do with your father's death? How could it? Then what is it you're not telling me? You can't trust what someone like me believes, right? If you tell me you saw something, I believe you. Um... No. I didn't see anything. I just heard her screaming, and I found her that way. Sorry, I had to call someone to come stay with her tomorrow. Is there gonna be any sort of investigation? No, I don't think so. It appears to be an accident. All right, we're done here. - Thank you. - Thank you. I talked to your aunt, and she said she'd come to stay with you tomorrow. I want you to stay with me. Tom, before Nina died, she was banging on the door of the laundry room and she couldn't get out. She what? She was pulling from the inside and I was pushing from the outside, and the door wouldn't open. There's no lock on that door, you know that. I know. Exactly. So what are you saying? She was screaming hysterically. There had to have been someone or something in there that wouldn't let her out. Are you talking about your dead father again? Please, please believe me. Why would your father want to hurt Nina? I can't believe I just asked that question. I don't know. I'm not sure what he wants. Babe, please stop this. I'm not making this up. I'm not imagining things. Look... you're going to be alone for a couple of hours until Aunt Margie gets here, but you're gonna be okay. No, Tom, please! It's been a long day. What do we do? Where are you going? Stay here. I have to go see if somebody's out there. The alarm company will call the police. Stop. I'm sure the alarm already scared 'em away. Which the police can verify when they get here. Stop it, Tom. Huh! That's weird. What? The laser sensors got tripped up. The ones on the inside of the house? How can the sensors inside the house get triggered before the outside sensors did? No, Tom! Please, please, don't go out there. Please. Did you call the police? I think we've had enough police here for one day. No, I'd feel better if they searched the house. Don't be afraid, baby. You got me! Okay, I know, but I'd prefer a couple of policemen with guns. I got a gun I can show you. I've already seen your gun. Maybe you need to see it again. So you believe me? Of course. I've always believed in those things. But why are you so sure that it's your father? Well, first of all, he died here. Your father died here? In this house? Well, I'd heard that he hardly came here anymore. Elizabeth always complained to a mutual friend of ours at the club that he never wanted to come down here. Why didn't he just sell it? I don't know. He and I never talked after your mother left. Why won't you talk to me about her? I don't want to cause you any more pain. I'm so tired of everyone treating me like I'm some sort of emotional cripple. Fine, what do you want to know? What happened between them? I've already told you how she suffered from depression for many years. Your father worked long hours and stayed away. That just drove her deeper and deeper into her depression. What happened on the day that she left? She showed up at my house and asked me to watch you for a couple of hours. What for? She said that she had something important to do. But she never came back. But I can't blame her. I'd stayed away from her, too. Being around her was just so hard for me. I guess that must be what it's like to be around me. Don't say that. Now... why do you think that it's your father that's haunting this house? The other day, the record player just went off by itself and it was playing this. My father used to play that record all the time when I was little. It was his favorite. No... this wasn't your father's favorite. It was your mother's. My mother's? Are you sure? Yes. I'll go get that. Then he arrived around six. - Mm-hmm. - Hello. Hey. What brings you back? Well... We found this in Nina's pocket. This belong to you? It wasn't Nina's? It's a big rock. Kind of expensive. - Does it look familiar? - Should it? I guess not. It could always be Elizabeth's. That's your father's second wife? Girlfriend. He never married the bitch. Okay, I guess I better go see her next. Thank you, see you soon. Yeah, you too. So about that record... That ring definitely didn't seem familiar to you? No. What are you looking for? The keys to the storage. What for? Tom took my dad's stuff to the storage, and... I need a photo album from there. What photo album? It's this old, green one from when I was little. There's lots of pictures of mom in it. But whatever for? Would you mind going down to the storage place and getting it for me? No, I guess-I guess not. Thank you so much, Aunt Margie. I think I'm finally gonna be able to prove to everyone that I'm not imagining things. Faye. Faye, It's me! I'm in the office! I am so sorry. I came as fast as I could. You look so pretty. Yeah? I was going to meet someone on a date, when Tom called and told me what happened. You canceled your date for me? Considering what happened? Absolutely. You shouldn't have. Aunt Margie came to stay with me. I couldn't not come. Where is she anyways? She went to the storage place to get something for me. You seem to be doing okay, considering. Are you finally working on your dissertation? No, I'm trying to find the footage of whatever triggered the alarm last night. Someone broke into your house last night? That's the thing. There was no break in. Only the inside sensors went off. I don't get it. Oh my God! What is it? Come here. Look at this. Who is that? More like, what is that? Have you ever seen anyone move that quickly? It's the recording that makes it look that fast, right? The timer says that thing moved across the room in three seconds. That thing? The ghost. Right. Tom told me. Your father's ghost. I'm back! Hello, sweetheart. Hi, Margie, pleasure to see you. - Special delivery! - Thank you so much. I knew it! The ring was my mother's. You're right! It's been so long since I've seen it I forgot what it looked like. What is going on? The ghost isn't my father. - It's my mother. - You think so? You don't even know if your mother is dead. - Nina found this ring in this house. - So? Why else would it be here? She must have come here after she dropped you off at my house. Probably to confront my father about Elizabeth. You have never known for a fact that your father and Elizabeth were together before your mother left. Except that conveniently three months later they were already living together. My father killed her. You're thinking your father killed your mother? So she's the one haunting this house? Where's my vodka? I can't believe that you are encouraging this insanity. You saw the video. What else do you need to believe me? What video? Okay, so you're thinking your father killed your mother because you found her ring. That's why he never wanted to come back here. That's why he wouldn't sell the house. Because he was afraid that somebody was gonna find her body here. Okay, maybe she left the ring at the condo, and your father brought it here. - Why would he do that? - Why would he kill her? Can you say for sure that she was wearing the ring the day she dropped off Faye? Not really. Then my explanation is as likely as any. What about everything else that's been happening? I'm not imagining things. Has anyone else seen or heard anything besides you? - No, but... - What about Tom? All the nights he slept over, he hasn't seen anything? No. What about Nina? Did she ever say that she had seen anything? No, but she was screaming in the laundry room before she died. So she screamed out when the window crushed her. That could've happened. I thought you were on my side. I am. If she says she saw something, I believe her. Let's see what Dr. Murphy and Tom believe. Doc, is it possible that one of the medications that you prescribed Faye is causing her to have these hallucinations? Hallucinations are not a side effect of that drug. However, paranoia is a classic symptom of underlying panic disorder. But she's never been paranoid before. It's obviously a new symptom. So she's getting worse instead of getting better? Stop talking about me like I'm not in this room. Faye, everybody in this room cares about you. Is there anything else you can do? Well, I could prescribe a higher dosage, but that would require 24 hour medical supervision. A live-in nurse? A mental health institution. For how long? For however long it takes. And how long will that be? Well, it's hard to predict these kinds of things. Oh, come on. We've all heard the stories about these places. They just keep people drugged up, and they are stuck there indefinitely. No. Patients that are in these places need that kind of 24 hour care like that. And none of us has the training or the time to be with her the whole day. I'll agree to it. But only if we take her to Regional Hospital. But I don't work there. Exactly. I think it's time that Faye finds a new doctor. Okay, you're making a big mistake. Finding a new doctor, you would have to start all over again. You've been treating her for eight years, and it doesn't seem to be helping. If anything, she's getting worse. Margie, what do you think? Isn't anyone gonna ask what I think? Do you want a new doctor, sweetie? I don't need a new doctor. I need you guys to believe me. You said yourself you didn't like his idea of bringing her here. No, I'm getting better. I'm so close to walking outside those doors. But you're developing new symptoms. No. I guess it is the right thing for her right now. But I thought you believed me. If what you say is true, then that's all the more reason to leave this house. There, you'll be safe. Babe... I love you more than anything in the world. We just want to see you get better. Faye, we will all help you. I mean, I can help Tom take care of your dad's business for a few weeks until you're better. Yes, you can count on all of us. Well... if you guys don't want me to treat her... Here... You're gonna need these sedatives for the long ride to Regional. Doc, it's not personal. Good luck, Faye. You know where to find me. If you're staying tonight, then I'll go ahead and leave. Are you sure? It's gonna start raining soon. I'll manage. I'll see you tomorrow, sweetie. Call me when you're about a... half hour away, and I'll meet you at the hospital. I'll go with you guys to the hospital in the morning. You need something to help you sleep? I'm afraid to go to sleep. Why, baby? What if something happens to me in my sleep, and I can't wake up? Faye, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Here, take one. I'm gonna go check on Stephanie. Mom... if it's really you... I am sorry for whatever happened here. Just please don't hurt me tonight, or Tom or Stephanie. They're the people I care about most in this world. And I promise we'll leave this house by tomorrow morning. What a night. What are we gonna do about this house? What do you mean? It's really too far for anyone to live here. It's a two hour drive to the hospital, and it's too pricey to keep as a weekend retreat. Let me guess... you want the listing? Faye, wake up. Faye. Did you hear that? What? I heard a noise. - What kind of noise? - Something moving upstairs. Oh, God, not you too. I'm serious. Maybe Faye is awake. You should go check on her. She took one of her pills. She's out like a light for the next eight hours. I could have sworn I heard a voice. This way. I definitely heard something. I swear, I'm surrounded by paranoid women. I'm going to check on Faye. She might be awake. She's dead to the world right now. Well, I'm gonna go just in case. I told you, she's asleep right now. Are you crazy? Not here. Why not? We can do it right here. We're so close, all right? Let's not mess it up now. You're just still pissed about the pregnancy. Of course, I'm still pissed. Oh, Steph, with all the drugs she's on, she's never in the mood. It's the truth. So then how'd the baby happen? Immaculate conception? I didn't said we never had sex, just not that often. We've been married for three years for Christ's sake! You just never enjoyed it, right? You know, I'm getting tired of your shit. This whole scheme was your idea. How did you think I was gonna be able to pull this off if we didn't have sex? I know, I know. I just... I never counted on how hard this was gonna be to see you guys together. Hey. Come tomorrow, it's just gonna be the two of us, all right? And 30 million dollars at our disposal. It's not gonna to be that easy, though. I have to get a doctor to declare her insane. Then, I have to get appointed as her legal guardian. With her insisting that she's seeing ghosts, that shouldn't be a problem. I have to say... the mats, the shoes, the cat stew... that was brilliant. The cat stew was Nina's idea. What if Faye had come in when she was switching the pots? We had to get rid of that cat. It was actually helping her get better. Poor Hamlet. But what really put the nail in the coffin was that shadow on the security video. How did you do that? What shadow? The one Faye showed me from last night. I don't know what you're talking about. Must have been Nina, then. I told her to pull out all the stops. But Nina died before the alarm went off. Well, it's too bad about Nina, then. One less person to share the money with. One less loose end. I can't believe that in less than 24 hours, I'll finally be free of her. I can't believe it's taken three years. You know, in the end though, I feel sorry for her. Really? Yeah, I'm pretty sure that she does need to be in a mental institution. Whatever makes you feel better about all this. Let's celebrate early. I heard that. Shit, she heard us. Great! I thought you said she was asleep. No one is going to believe her. They think she's crazy. We can't take that chance. Then what do we do? - She has to die. - What? It won't be that hard. We just make it look like a suicide. We can't kill her. If she's alive and then divorces me, we get nothing. Her dad made me sign a pre-nup, remember? What do you wanna do? We tie her up. Make her take an overdose of pills. At least we know she can't go very far. You wanna tie her up with that? Faye. Come on out, Faye. We all know you're not going anywhere. Faye, come on out and talk to us about this. I'm sorry, Faye. Come on, nobody's gonna hurt you. Forgive me, Faye. I was always just so jealous of you in school. I let the money cloud my judgment, Faye. Please. Hon? You scream out as soon as you see her. Faye? I'm so sorry, Faye... but you've no idea how hard this has been for me... always by your side... always taking care of you. Come on out. Talk to us. Please. Faye? Faye. You know, this isn't Tom's fault. I'm the one who told him about your father being ill. All he had to do was... act like a courier so he could meet you. You know, I really do think he fell for you. So you see... you beat me again. Faye? Faye... it wasn't supposed to happen like this. You were supposed to just go get the help you needed. I offered you all my money. Don't think I didn't consider it. It was certainly a lot less work than all this. It would mean being cooped up in here with you for the rest of my life. So you preferred to just drive me crazy? I hate to break it to you, sweetheart, but you've been bat-shit crazy since the day I met you. Look at you, Faye! You finally did it! Too bad that's as far as you're gonna go. Well, I guess you were right, Faye. You are getting better. Maybe I should have taken you up on that offer, Faye. Lord knows the sex wasn't half bad. I was the best you've ever had. Wait, what am I thinking? I was the only one you've ever had. How are you going to explain Stephanie's body? Murder-suicide. Poor, poor Faye. Is it too late to take you up on that offer, Faye? I mean just look at you. You could be running marathons now. We could have a beautiful life together. Think about it, Faye. Who else are you going to find who's going to put up with all your little... problems. What we had was something special. Angel face? You know I still love you. Give me another chance, Faye. I had these in Jamaica once. Cheers. So, uh... have you seen or heard her again? I think her work is done. I just can't believe they found her body all cut into pieces. I know. I was so afraid of her, but all she was trying to do was to warn me about them. Oh, I'll get it. Used to it. Detective! Come in. Hello. Thank you. Join us. Would you like a drink? No, thank you, I'm here on official business. Well, I think mine needs a little more rum. Hello. Come on, sit down for a minute. Thank you. Okay. I wanted to tell you the Medical Examiner's report on those bones that we found buried next your husband's body came back. And the DNA proves that they definitely belonged to your mother. I already knew that. You did? You think your father's girlfriend had something to do with it? You'll have to ask her that. Well, we definitely will. Let me ask you something. Are you ever going to tell me what really happened here? Do you believe in the supernatural, Detective? The supernatural? Like ghosts and things like that? Put it this way. The spirits of our loved ones, they watch over us. I'd really like to believe that. Hamlet! Oh, my gosh, Hamlet, my baby. Oh, I missed you so much. Are you okay? Are you okay? Look at mommy. Oh, my gosh. I don't know what else you want me to try, Elizabeth. Really? No, there's no way. I don't think so. I don't want to hear any more excuses. You find a way. I didn't spend the best years of my life with that man to be tossed aside with nothing. Nothing? Elizabeth, you're getting a condo that's worth over ten million dollars on the ocean. You're getting more than most women get after 15 years of marriage. What are you complaining about? I don't care how much this condo is worth. I want everything. If you can't find a way to get that little hermit out of my house, I'll get another lawyer. What the hell is this? What the...?
