And if I say I won't, will you kill me, your own father? Do you desire power so much? Why do you seek power? The path I walk is the Way of Supreme Conquest. And it is power that will reveal the way for me. The Way of Supreme Conquest, huh? Tell me Sesshomaru... Have you someone to protect? Someone to protect? I, Sesshomaru, have no need of such. Please wait, Lord Takemaru! The Princess is in labor! She is going to have a child fathered by a demon! There is no need for decorum! A man must not enter! Lord Takemaru...? Dearest... Have you someone to protect? Ridiculous! You must not do this! Do not be rash! Please reconsider! The wounds from your battle with Ryukotsusei have not healed! I cannot let her die! - But...! - Besides... I am not long for this world. Master! A lunar eclipse... A perfect night to slay a demon. Who is it? It is I, Takemaru of Setsuna. Takemaru? Thank goodness you are here. Gather the men outside and leave immediately. There is no one who can defy him. My Lady Izayoi, I have long felt a deep attachment towards you. Even if your heart has been captured by a demon...! My feelings for you will never change. Izayoi! I am coming! Wind Scar! Izayoi! Izayoi! So you've come, demon! A little late, though. What? Lady Izayoi is in a place beyond your reach. I sent her there myself. Fool! Set it afire! Burn down this mansion... along with its occupants and the demon! Izayoi! Izayoi! I'm counting on you, Tenseiga! I have no regrets since I am fighting you. Let us journey together to the netherworld! Live! My dear...! Inuyasha. What? The infant's name. The infant shall be named Inuyasha. Inuyasha? Now go! Yes! Izayoi... You must live. Live long. Together with Inuyasha. My name is Kagome Higurashi. My name is Kagome Higurashi. Inuyasha! My name is Kagome Higurashi. I was your average middle schooler, until one day, I fell into an ancient well in our family shrine until one day, I fell into an ancient well in our family shrine What took you so long? I've been starving! And passed through time into the feudal era. What took you so long? I've been starving! And passed through time into the feudal era. There, I met a half demon named Inuyasha who is part demon and part human. There, I met a half demon named Inuyasha who is part demon and part human. No thanks! There, I met a half demon named Inuyasha who is part demon and part human. There, I met a half demon named Inuyasha who is part demon and part human. Got anything better? Got anything better? He's so moody and spoiled, but oh so strong! Got anything better? He's so moody and spoiled, but oh so strong! He's so moody and spoiled, but oh so strong! - Hey, I went to a lot of trouble - All I'm saying is Inuyasha has a demon brother named Sesshomaru who covets the Tetsusaiga, a sword passed down from their father. Even though he already has a sword, the Tenseiga. I said, I'll protect you! Presently, our group includes Miroku, a monk who has a Wind Tunnel in his palm which will swallow up anything. Hey Inuyasha! And Sango the Demon Slayer. Hey Inuyasha! And Sango the Demon Slayer. Along with Shippo, the young fox demon, we journey in search of the Shikon Jewel shards. Inuyasha! You didn't have to eat it all! At first, it was hard living in the feudal era, Inuyasha! You didn't have to eat it all! At first, it was hard living in the feudal era, Inuyasha! But I've grown accustomed to it And through great teamwork, I'm managing fine. - You lecherous monk! - But Sango - You lecherous monk! - But Sango Sit boy! And besides, I get to return to the present time once in a while like this. There it comes! Kagome! Okay! Go! Yuka! I'll get it! Watch it, Kagome! Hey! Where's the ball?! Did someone just call you, Kagome? Didn't something just pass us by? Yeah! Just try and hurt Kagome with somethin' like this! Hey Kagome! Over here! Hey! Sit! What's wrong, Kagome? What did you mean by "sit"? Oh... Did I say that? You sure did! Yeah... Oh... I meant vinegar is good. Vinegar? You know vinegar is good for you, right? Grandpa always tells me to sip vinegar 'cause it's good for your health. But... oww... I think I drank too much and now I have a tummy ache. - 'Scuse me, okay? - Are you all right? I'm home. Welcome back, Sota. What's that? Oh that... A family shrine treasure a sword passed down from generation to generation known as the Sword of Murakumo. That's what it is. Oh... The Sword of Murakumo is the alternate name for the Sword of Kusanagi which appears in the annals of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. In other words, it is a national treasure. Geez! Why'd you come to my school?! I didn't want anything to happen to you. I have to watch out for you since you always get into scrapes. This time period isn't as dangerous as yours. Grrr... I was just playing volleyball it's a sport. Rather, it's like exercise. Exercise? Is it a game like kemari? Yes, that's precisely it! Have you ever played? I don't have nice memories about it. That was the time I saw my mother's tears. Inuyasha? - What? - Is something wrong? No, it's nothing. By the way, can't you do something about the Beads of Subjugation? If you keep telling me to "sit," my body won't hold up. Do I say "sit" that often...? Oops, sorry! I didn't mean that. It's too late! This is the grave of Inuyasha's mother? Yes. She was very beautiful. It's been many years since Lady Izayoi passed away. But Master Inuyasha still misses her. Did you place those flowers there, Myoga? Oh no... It was probably Master Inuyasha. So there is a kind side of him. Yes... He is half human. He can't help but have some traits that are unbecoming of demons. So being kind is not a good thing? There! Now then, the Sword of Murakumo is the magical sword that Prince Susano Oh found inside the beast, Yamata no Orochi, which he slew. And we take it out once in a while and give it an airing. But there is rust on this sword and I can't remove it from its sheathe. There! I've made space for it here. There's something written on this. It says Sword of Murakumo. But doesn't this last character mean "fang"? What!? Then it must be read Sounga. Hah! So it's a fake! No, that's impossible! This is a sword of true value, found by our forefather's forefather generations ago in the ancient well. That makes it sound even more fake. No! There is a scroll which describes the event. Now where was it? Oh, isn't that it? This sword bites! Don't be silly! Hey, when did I bite? This sword can speak! I am the one speaking. Not Sounga. Oh! Only in our shrine could such a treasured sword be found! Oh no.... The 700 year old seal will be broken. What?! A 700 year old seal? Sounga will be free of me. Hey! Is there a strong demon nearby? A demon? Oh dear.. . What a bind I'm in! The Sounga is a terrible demon sword! Terrible things will happen.. ! Hey Sounga! Where are you going?! Wait! Hey! It went away. Our family treasure! - What's that? - Looks like a sword? - A sword? - But can a sword fly?! - Something's coming! - Huh? Where, where? What's that?! What's that?! Man, it hurts... I said I'm sorry. Now put the hat on. Huh? A strong demonic aura! Stand back! Finally, it's calmed down. What? Well, well! If it isn't Tetsusaiga! It's been a long time. What? Could you be Inuyasha? I don't know any swords! Well, I don't blame you for not remembering. You were just a newborn back then. I am Saya. The sheathe of Sounga, the famous sword of Supreme Conquest wielded by your father. My father? Oh no.... It's acting up again! This sword.... I have a really bad feeling about it. Hey Inuyasha! Hurry and take hold of Sounga! Otherwise, terrible things will happen! I don't take orders from you! Oh, it's too late! It's freed itself! This is... What is this? Can the two of you see it? This is the future of this land which Sounga will bring about. This is... the future? Sounga's frightening power will make the skies dark and cause the lands to decay. And people will die. What do we do to prevent this from happening? Take Sounga and leave this land. However, a human must not wield Sounga. And if a human did take hold of it? It will be the end of this world. Anyone wielding the Sounga will continue killing until every other human is killed, whether it takes decades or centuries. Humans are more egotistical and greedy than any other living creature. When a human possesses the power of the Sounga, he becomes more evil than any demon alive. Can't be helped. I'll put the sword back in its sheathe. Inuyasha... Inuyasha! I'm so relieved! Here, your hat. Stay away! Inuyasha! Inuyasha...! What IS this sword anyway?! So you are his son? Are you... Sounga?! And you think you are strong enough to subdue me? Obey me! And I shall make you supreme ruler of these lands. Shaddup! I ain't interested in such a thing! There's a better place for you to be! I'll take you there! Inuyasha...! I'll go get rid of this! Get rid of it? How? It's my old man's sword! I should be able to do something about it! But...! Don't follow me! I'm going, Kagome. Inuyasha! What a relief! It's a burden off my shoulders and I can breathe easy. Stupid! Stupid Inuyasha! Acting so proud! Trying to do everything by yourself! Why can't you rely on me a bit more?! Hey... You're the sheathe of that sword, aren't you? That I am... Then you can suppress the power of the sword? Well, I wonder.... You can, can't you? I can't say until I try... Then it's decided. What is that? That's... It's coming from the Bone Eater's Well. T That's ridiculous! Tenseiga? What's the matter, Lord Sesshomaru? Lord Sesshomaru laughed! Something bad is about to happen. Is that you, Inuyasha? Shippo, get away! Get... away! Inuyasha, what's wrong with you?! Stop! Inuyasha! A demon! A demon is coming! What?! Everyone run! A demon! Help! Help! Inuyasha! Huh?! He's not the usual Inuyasha. Whatever happened to him? What's going on?! That's Sounga! Kill them! Kill them! Stop, Inuyasha! Come back to your senses! What's wrong, Inuyasha? Kill them! Kill them, I said. Snap out of it, Inuyasha! Do it! Kill them! Silence its noisy cries! Do it! Stop! Why you! Inuyasha! So you won't heed my words? Kill them! Kill them! Miroku... take them away quickly! - What's happened to Inuyasha? - I don't know. Something is wrong with him! Shippo! Inuyasha! Stay back! Get away from me! I'll send you all to hell! Oh no! It's the Dragon Twister! Everyone, take to the skies! Kirara! Please go! Dragon Twister! How frightening! Such incomprehensible power! That was the Dragon Twister, the attack of a dragon from hell! Its destructive power surpasses even the Backlash Wave. We must stop Inuyasha quickly! If we approach him now, we'll all be killed! Let's wait for Kagome. That's all we can do at this point. It's quiet now. It used up its power with that Dragon Twister. And now it needs to recoup, huh? 'Morning! Kagome... Kagome! What happened here? Did Inuyasha use the Dragon Twister? W Who was it that just spoke? It was me! Anything wrong with that? Am I bothering you? He's awfully touchy, this guy. It's you, Saya! Why does Inuyasha have the Sounga? It's been awhile, Myoga! Still running away from things? Answer my question! Well, things have happened. You're the one who told me you'd take care of things for about 700 years. You slacked off again, huh?! What're you saying? I kept strict guard for 200 years! The numbers don't add up! Umm... Maybe passing through the Bone Eater's well had something to do with it? The Bone Eater's Well? Oh Kagome! You're back! Sango! Now we're all together. Let's follow the trail of the Dragon Twister. Is it that sword which awakened us? We have protected this land for ages. This is an forgivable act! Now, you shall taste the power and wrath of the great Ogre tribe! Prepare to die! Dammit! Good, Inuyasha. Your heart is steadily trying to become one with mine. Lord Sesshomaru! Please wait! Lord Sesshomaru! Where are you headed? Is it close, Tenseiga? But this scent.... Kagome, look! Dead demons! I'll go take a look. You stay here, Kagome. I hope it's safe. It hasn't been long since it died. I still sense an evil aura close by. Is it Sounga's aura? Huh? Well.. . Yes. It's supposed to be dead! I just remembered! Those slain by Sounga come back as soul less undead creatures! What?! Hiraikotsu! It's still alive! Wind Tunnel! Miroku! Are you all right?! Their corpses contain potent miasma! You shouldn't take them in. I wish you'd said so sooner! What'll we do then? Fire! Burning them is the best way! That's my cue! Fox Fire! Not enough fire power. Kirara! Are you all right? Thank you! Miroku! Kagome! Never mind me. Go and find Inuyasha! - But... - I'll look after Miroku. If more of these appear, we won't be able to handle them. All right, I understand. So it is you, Inuyasha. How did one like you come to possess the Sounga? Don't tell me that another one of Father's swords chose you? How would I know?! I'd gladly give this one to you... but it seems you're gonna have to take it by force. I intended to anyway. Master Jaken... Lord Sesshomaru and Inuyasha are siblings, but they really don't get along, do they? Must you state the obvious?! But Lord Sesshomaru is very angry. Has Inuyasha's possession of the sword upset him that much? But in retrospect, Lord Sesshomaru's father was so heartless! Entrusting the powerful swords only to Inuyasha.... and leaving Lord Sesshomaru the useless Tenseiga! You are not fit to wield the Sounga or the Tetsusaiga! The fact that Father's blood flows through your veins is unforgivable. Who cares about that! Sesshomaru, do you covet the Sounga? When our blades clash, I can read you completely. Even about Inuyasha cutting off your left arm. Shut your damn mouth for a second! He must be there! Totosai! Oh, it's you Kagome. Totosai, it's been awhile. Oh Saya, you're here too, eh? You're all acquaintances? Totosai, you must have guessed already... I never thought that Sounga would return... Inuyasha has it now. What? Inuyasha doesn't have the power to control it. I had a suspicion about that.... Why did you make such a dangerous sword? That wasn't me. The Great Dog Demon had it from long ago. He's right. Unlike Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga, Sounga is possessed by the spirit of an ancient evil demon. With the Great Dog Demon gone, the only one who can wield the Sounga is probably Sesshomaru. Lord Sesshomaru! What's the matter, Inuyasha? Can't win it alone? Then use my power! L Lord Sesshomaru is on the defensive! Two blood brothers killing each other.... You two are just as foolish as your father was. If he had heeded my words, he would not have met such a miserable death. Silence! Amazing! You must hand it to Lord Sesshomaru! How can this be? I have never seen Lord Sesshomaru brought to his knees! Such a persistent one! Blood.... Not enough blood. Give me a live sacrifice! He's coming! Stop! Don't come any closer! Sit boy! What is this?! SIT BOY! Damn wench! Master Jaken! Oh dear... Oh, it seems Sounga has been driven off. Leave it to Kagome! Ohh! You're back to your old self, Inuyasha! You are free of Sounga. It's all due to this girl. Inu... yasha... I came. I'm sorry. Kagome! Hey Kagome! Dammit! That's why I told you to stay away! Wait! I'll destroy the Sounga! I don't want your interference! It is impossible for you. What?! Be grateful to that girl. Master Jaken, wake up! Lord Sesshomaru is leaving! Master Inuyasha, I'm so glad you are safe. - Myoga... - Yes? What was my old man like? Well... He had tasty blood. Never mind that! Was he strong? Well, he was a great demon, so... Was he stronger than I am right now? Well... 'Fess up! The Great Dog Demon was a thousand times stronger. He never made the mistake of allowing Sounga to control him. I see... Master Inuyasha! Take care of Kagome. Huh? Where do you intend to go? Isn't it obvious? How can I let Sounga get away? Well then, take Saya with you. Err.. . I really don't want to go.... Kagome, I can't involve you. I'll do something about my old man's sword myself. Why did Father leave me, not the Sounga nor Tetsusaiga... but the Tenseiga? Not much of a body, but better than nothing. With this, I can use the Dragon Twister. I shall destroy both the Tetsusaiga and the Tenseiga! Awaken, Takemaru of Setsuna! I am Sounga. Sounga? Why do you call me from the dead? I, Sounga, shall save your wandering soul. Take revenge with me. Against the sons of the one who killed you.... take revenge against Sesshomaru and Inuyasha. Unleash your pent up grudge! Grudge? The woman who abandoned you.... Izayoi! You loved that woman. And he stole your woman. Hate him! Hate the woman! Hate his sons! Otherwise, your soul will forever be chained here. Now, I call upon you! Let us take revenge against his sons! Hate! I hate Inuyasha.. . And Sesshomaru! And I hate Izayoi! A sword which makes a man keep on killing until the world is destroyed... In ages past, countless men sought to be the supreme ruler of this world and searched for the Sounga, stole it, and killed each other. The one who stopped this senseless cycle... Was Inuyasha's father? Yes. Oh Kagome, you're conscious! Where's Inuyasha? Where did Inuyasha go? Hah! Who cares about Inuyasha! Why are you both here? Well... It's not that Lord Sesshomaru left us... - He did, didn't he? - Uh huh. Don't say anything! I can't stay here! I must catch up to Lord Sesshomaru! No, Master Jaken. We must thank Kagome properly. I didn't ask to be saved! That girl acted willfully! Here! The enchanted beads... You gathered them? I'm not sure if they're all there. Thank you. No, I should thank you for saving me. Can no one stop Inuyasha now? Stupid Inuyasha! He's such a bother! It's all your fault, Saya! Saya! Huh? What? What's the matter? You said you could seal the Sounga for about 700 years. Did I? But why was the Sounga at our shrine? It can't be helped... Let us tell you the tale. This goes back about 200 years... when Inuyasha's father died. Master! Don't cry, Myoga. Crying won't bring back the great Dog Demon. I know that, but... By the way, did you take care of the Tetsusaiga according to his will? Naturally! I sealed it behind the black pearl together with the Master's body. And I made sure Tenseiga was passed on to Sesshomaru. FOR SESSHOMARU FOR SESSHOMARU You didn't give it to him yourself? FOR SESSHOMARU Why would I do such a dangerous thing? I want to live a long life! Which leaves this problem the Sounga. Saya... Are you sure Master didn't leave any instructions for the Sounga? No, he only left instructions for Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga. Oh dear... Knowing the Master, he must have good reason for this. But what a problem he left us with. The Tetsusaiga which their father wielded, along with the Tenseiga and Sounga were known as the three swords of supreme conquest, with the power to dominate the three worlds. Three worlds? Heaven, Hell, and Earth are the three worlds. Heaven, where the Buddha and gods reside. Hell, the netherworld. The world of the dead. And Earth, this world in which we reside. Each sword corresponded to one world... Heaven's Tenseiga could save a hundred lives in one sweep. Sounga of Hell could open the gateway to the netherworld and summon a hundred dead souls in one sweep. Tetsusaiga, the guardian of men, could fell a hundred enemies in one sweep. And Inuyasha's father possessed all three swords? So greedy! And then what happened? We couldn't think of a good solution, and we were in a dilemma. How about letting Sesshomaru have it? Don't be ridiculous! He's upset with us over Tenseiga. If he finds us, we'll all be killed. And Inuyasha is just an infant. If it's just to keep the Sounga quiet, I think I could hold on to it for about 700 years. I guess I have no choice.... Throw me into the Bone Eater's Well in the land of Musashi. - Bone Eater's Well? - Bone Eater's Well? I've heard that if a demon's corpse is thrown into the well, it will disappear somewhere. That would work, wouldn't it? And that's how it came to be at our shrine? Now although it's only been 200 years here, beyond the well, it's been a good 700 years. Why is it that Kagome doesn't age when she passes through the well? Well.... It is the Bone Eater's Well swirling with demonic aura. So Saya, is there a way to defeat the Sounga? Just one. With Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga. Pitted one on one, Sounga will be stronger. But with the two swords combined, it is possible to beat Sounga. Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga? If Inuyasha and Sesshomaru join forces... Lord Sesshomaru join forces with Inuyasha?! Are you crazy?! Hell will freeze over before that happens! I agree with him. Same here. Me too. Saya, can't you seal the Sounga one more time? Don't ask the impossible. I've hung in there for a thousand years, and I'm exhausted. Wasn't it 200 hundred years? I've aged quite a lot. Kagome, don't be too hopeful about that. Exactly! You can't rely on Saya. Huh?! Takemaru, use this.... What is it? Sesshomaru's left arm. With that arm, you can produce the Dragon Twister. You will have no rival in this universe. It will do you good to test it. The path of the supreme conqueror who knows no rival, huh? Rejoice, everyone! Our castle is in sight! We celebrate our triumphant return tonight! Drink up and make merry! Huh? W What is it? Such a strange cloud movement. Hurry men! The rain is coming! Open the gate! What's going on?! W Who are you?! I am called Takemaru of Setsuna. Men! Dragon Twister! This arm doesn't heed my instructions too well. What was the Sounga doing in a place like this? Takemaru of Setsuna... The Sounga chose that vermin? You know him? That's unusual. This is a human burial site. Just what's your connection to this? I have no connection to that vermin. If there is a connection, it is to you. Me? Humph... You probably aren't aware. You were born ignorant, and you live as an ignorant half demon. So then, you can die ignorant! Die and give me that Tetsusaiga! Well, it looks like you've forgotten something! That Tetsusaiga's barrier rejects you! That may be so. But I'll have enough time to kill that worm! I'll destroy the old man's sword! You stay out of it! You don't even know what Father looked like! So don't talk big! You merely received Father's sword! Just what... can a half demon like you do?! Sorry if I'm a half demon! But seeing as I've beaten you time and again, you're just a loser dog! Behold... Dragon Strike! I was expecting somethin' like that! Backlash Wave! Sesshomaru, why do you seek power? Father.... I wanted to defeat you, the one with supreme power. Yet you died.... for the sake of a mortal woman and Inuyasha. You, the one with the ultimate power.... the one I was supposed to beat! Inuyasha! You and your mother caused his miserable death! W What?! My Backlash Wave...! This was as much as the Tokijin could manage... I failed in killing him again. Sheathe... Did you protect me? Inuyasha never spoke about his father. When I asked why, he'd say because he didn't even know what his father looked like. But then, why is he so obsessed with his father's sword? Why is he trying to resolve everything all alone? That's how boys are. A boy's father is always at the forefront of one's consciousness. How can I put it...? It's very irritating. What your father can do, you can do. And one day, you'll surpass him. For boys, a father is a role model. Then if one's father is great, that's tough. Well, I guess so. Hey! Keep your hands to yourself when you talk! Oh, I got this habit from my father. I must overcome it someday, too. Forget it! When you think about it, Inuyasha's desire to get the Sacred Jewel shards to become a full fledged demon all boils down to his wish to become a great demon like his father. You're right. Though he's already strong enough. Damn! I don't even "know what Father looked like, " huh? You're lucky, Sesshomaru. You know what the old man looked like. You've spoken with the old man. Fallen soldiers all! Rise from the dead! Now come anytime! Sesshomaru and Inuyasha! I shall wield Father's Sounga with this arm.... At that moment, I shall have the same power as Father. Tetsusaiga, looks like we're gonna be in a huge battle. That cloud... What an ominous air... It seems as though that is Sounga's citadel. Let's hurry! Kagome, are you serious about going? Of course! But just what is the meaning of this? Meaning? I understand Inuyasha's involvement in this. But there's no reason for you to fight. So why do you? Are you fond of fighting? I am not! I hate fighting, but I want to stay by Inuyasha's side. That's all. Oh dear.... No matter how old I get, I will never understand humans. I completely agree. Same here. Forward! You are an interesting man.... With Dragon Twister, it would be over in a second. But then my hatred will not subside. I want those two to suffer to the fullest. Fine... So many of them. They're all dead soldiers... He's killed too many! That Sounga.. . He used the Dragon Twister yet again. There are about 2000 enemy soldiers. Excluding Myoga, Rin and Momo from fighting, there are eight of us plus two demons. That's 200 soldiers for each of us. But how do we kill the living dead? If you weaken the demonic aura around them, they can be destroyed. It will take time, though. Hey Miroku... Why isn't a weak, little guy like me excluded from fighting? What are you saying? We're depending on you... and your Fox Fire. Oh... oh I see! Jaken, fire works well against them! We're counting on you! I'll show them the power of the Staff of Two Heads! You're trembling with fear! Silly! I'm trembling with excitement! Rain... Huh?! Inuyasha! I have no business with you guys! Where's your leader?! Where's this Takemaru who has the Sounga?! Go! Geez, I don't want to waste my strength on something like this! Take this! Staff of Two Heads! Go, Master Jaken! Hiraikotsu! Sacred Sutras! Take this! Fox Fire! Aghh! It doesn't work too well! Move! Move! Outta my way! Even a demon's strength will weaken... And that moment... is the moment of victory! Damn! They're close. Dragon Strike! Is that Sesshomaru? Takemaru, destroy the Tenseiga. Understood. Shattering the Tenseiga is a simple task. The fang of a weak demon... That's all it is. Poison Claw! You're in the way! Tenseiga.... A sword I wouldn't miss if I lost it, but.... Father.... That's Lord Sesshomaru's...! What is this? You there, Rin! He wants the Tenseiga! No! This belongs to Lord Sesshomaru! Kagome! Kagome! Kagome! Help... Lord Sesshomaru! Kagome! Huh? Who is that? Takemaru of Setsuna who fought with Inuyasha's father 200 years ago. Hmm.. . You brought something very interesting. Huh?! That Sounga has possessed Takemaru! Takemaru.. . These young girls are just like Izayoi. That Izayoi whom you killed. Izayoi? Who's Izayoi? Inuyasha's mother! Then he killed Inuyasha's mother? If you kill that girl, how will Inuyasha react? Hey stop! Don't come near! You are both Izayoi! Females who share an affinity with demons are all Izayoi! This guy.. . He's stark crazy! Move, move! Sesshomaru! Useless fool! So what are you doing here? Shaddup! Sesshomaru! When this is over, we'll settle things for good! If you live that long! You'd better not be killed by anyone else! How's that?! Hold it! That's dirty, Sesshomaru! Come then! What're you going to do with that? It can put up a barrier or something, right?! A rusty old sheathe is useless. What?! Kagome! How dare you?! A man shouldn't hurt girls! Rin, run away... Don't worry! Lord Sesshomaru will save us without fail! Resign yourselves and go to the netherworld. Rin! Die! Lord Sesshomaru! Lord Sesshomaru! Go! You'll only be in my way! Let's go, Rin! Lord Sesshomaru! Here! Hurry and go. Yes. You're late. That left arm... Yes, it's yours. Want it back? No thanks! Damn! Their bodies are imitations... but their swords are real?! There's no end to this! Inuyasha! You all...! Aren't you exhausted, Inuyasha?! I didn't ask for help! Don't be so proud, Inuyasha! This is none of your business! Yeah, this is none of our business! But we're your friends! Heh, just do as you please! How does it feel? To be killed by your own hand? Is that all you were? What? You haven't noticed that you're just Sounga's puppet. You actually believe that it's your power... Such a miserable specter you are. Silence! You'll suffer the same humiliation your father wrought upon me! What?! Be honored... You will be killed with my father's fang! Hah! This way, Rin! Kagome! Kirara! I'm here! There're still so many! Everyone all right? I'm fine! I can manage! Shippo! Kirara! Oh dear, this is troublesome. Sango! Inuyasha, leave this to us. Hurry and go to Kagome! Miroku! I'll take care of the rest with my Wind Tunnel. Now hurry! A All right. Miroku! If you use the Wind Tunnel... You've all reached your limits. Besides, if I don't use it for the woman I love... what good will it do to have this? Miroku... You two! The enemy's right behind you! Now you living dead! Find peace! Wind Tunnel! Miroku... I owe you one! Miroku... Miroku! Hang on! Don't die! What can you do with a sword that can't kill?! It can't kill humans, but it can kill the living dead! What? Can't even kill a corpse? Release Kagome! Kagome! Thank you, Rin! That's no good! Oh! I keep missing. Move, you klutz! Inuyasha! I guess you can't do without me, huh? Don't tell me that was also "sports"? No, it wasn't. Umm... Lord Sesshomaru is still up there... Damn him! Showing off by himself! Wait! Don't stop me! I have to settle things with Sounga! So listen to me! What is it? In order to destroy Sounga, Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga have to combine forces and work together! Exactly! What?! You must combine your Backlash Wave with Sesshomaru's Dragon Strike, in order to defeat Sounga's Dragon Twister. Hah! No way will Sesshomaru cooperate with me! Stupid! You have to cooperate with Sesshomaru! I ain't gonna do that! There's no other way! You're brothers! Defer to him just this once! Try it! You can do it, Inuyasha! You've managed every time until now. Hah! Like it's so easy to do! What's the matter? The enchanted beads... We're still connected, aren't we? What's wrong, Sesshomaru? Your father's fang is crying! Do you have someone to protect? Father... Your nose is sharp as ever. You picked up the scent of my Wind Scar, huh? Your wind is no more than a gentle breeze. Heh, I was hoping to take you both out at the same time! Two brothers working together to avenge their father, huh? So even demons have feelings? Who the hell are you to talk?! Looking at you reminds me of lzayoi. Huh?! A foolish woman who abandoned me and gave birth to a half breed like you... Why you Listen well, Inuyasha... I am the man who sent your mother to the netherworld. Move! Get back! Shaddup! You're not going to one up me this time! This is the perfect opportunity to kill you both at the same time! Takemaru, use the Dragon Twister. Destroy the Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga. I don't need you to tell me that! Like I'd let you! You don't know when to give up, do you?! I just don't like to give up! Huh?! Lmpossible...! Why you! You still have such power.... This is nothing to be surprised about! It's inconceivable in a demon! Damn right! I'm a half demon! More egotistical and greedy than any other living creature... That's a human being, right? Well, human blood flows through my veins and that's why I just won't give up! On top of that... when a human has someone he has to protect, his power increases multifold. That's why I'm able to destroy you now! I owe it to my mother! Takemaru.... Izayoi... Hurry and leave immediately. Hurry and leave with the men outside. Lady lzayoi... You... I do not want you to die. You tried to protect me... Takemaru.. ? What's wrong, Takemaru? I remember... I never resented Lady lzayoi. I always... loved... Lady lzayoi... It's over. Hah! I don't know what you're up to, but I'm the one who beat him! It's not over yet. Huh?! Persistent bastard! I shall open the path to the underworld! Oh no! Sounga has opened the gateway to Hell! What happens when it's open? The boundary between the living and the dead disappears. We'll all end up dead. Oh no...! After all, it's the sword that controls Hell. While Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga exchange blows, Sounga is trying to absorb this world into Hell. Fool! Don't go near there! What is that?! The dead of the underworld. They're calling out to the souls of the living. We must hurry and run away, or your souls will be swallowed up! But Inuyasha and Sesshomaru are still... Here it comes! They cause so much trouble! What is this? This feeling deep in my heart? Sango, you must be strong. Do not let your heart be devoured by the darkness! Everyone! Gather round me! It's so cold, Master Jaken! Hey Saya! Can't you do something?! With my power, this is the limit. But if you leave my barrier, all the humans will be taken over by the dead. No way! If anything happens to Rin, I'll be killed by Lord Sesshomaru! Huh?! Lord Sesshomaru! Move! You're in my way! You're such a disappointment. A vulgar sword deserves a cast off arm. You can't wield the Sounga! Move! I'll be the one to destroy you! That won't work! You can't attack him separately! Kagome! Where are you going?! Inuyasha! Kagome! Please fight together with Sesshomaru! No way! Sesshomaru! Please cooperate with Inuyasha! What?! Are you listening, Sesshomaru?! Yes, Lord Sesshomaru! There's no need for you to ally yourself with a half demon like Inuyasha! Lord Sesshomaru... Please join forces with Inuyasha. Move! I give up on both of you nincompoops! Now! Why you! Kagome! Kagome! Hold this! Lt'll protect you for a little while. W What's happening?! The hole is expanding! It's dangerous here, too! But Kagome and Inuyasha are...! It's useless... Dragon Twister! What?! Inuyasha! Inuyasha! Dammit! Backlash Wave! You're not bad. This is entertaining! Damn! I missed! Inuyasha! Wait here! I'll be back without fail! All right. Kid, how's this? Backlash Wave! My Backlash Wave isn't working! Inuyasha...! Even Lord Sesshomaru is at a disadvantage when empty handed. Was that the limit of Dragon Twister's power? Tenseiga and Tetsusaiga are nearby. So Sounga can't utilize its full power. Inuyasha! Take this! I'll send you both to Hell! You're in the way! Lord Sesshomaru! Ah! Lord Sesshomaru, you are safe! He protected himself at the last second with Tenseiga's barrier. Hey Myoga, weren't you with Kagome? Err... Well... It seemed to me that Sesshomaru also protected Inuyasha. Yes... I can't produce the Backlash Wave! Inuyasha! Now do you realize how weak you are, half demon? Sesshomaru! It is your turn next! It ain't over yet! Like... I said... with human blood flowing through my veins... I don't give up! Then this time, I shall deliver the final blow! Fall to Hell with the mortal girl! Come at me! I'll counter your attack with my Backlash Wave! Dragon Twister! Go! Backlash Wave! Fool! As if you can win with just the Tetsusaiga! Try as you may to stop me! But the world of mortals will be swallowed up by the netherworld! Shut your mouth! I have someone to protect! That's why I can't give up! Tenseiga? Have you someone to protect? Lord Sesshomaru! Lord Sesshomaru! Lord Sesshomaru! Lord Sesshomaru! Lord Sesshomaru! Lord Sesshomaru! Lord Sesshomaru! Have you someone to protect? Someone to protect? I, Sesshomaru, have no one to protect! What?! Did we get him?! The cloud is being swallowed up! Kagome! - Lord Sesshomaru! - Lord Sesshomaru! Kagome! Inuyasha! You're both okay! 'Course! Inuyasha, look! That's the Sounga! Father.... - Master! - Master! What! Father? Then that's?! Sesshomaru.. . Inuyasha.... You finally found the answer. With this, Sounga has been sealed forever in the netherworld. There is nothing more to say to you. Old man! Father.... The Master believed in his sons and left everything in their hands. What do you mean? The only chance to seal Sounga, the sword of calamity, was the moment the gateway to Hell opened. And that only became possible when Tenseiga and Tetsusaiga combined their powers. The Master hoped that this would happen. Hah! The nerve of him! Ridiculous! - Wait, Lord Sesshomaru! - Wait, Lord Sesshomaru! Saya! If you heard the Master's last wishes, why didn't you speak up earlier?! Well, I was just thinking of those two.... Hah! I'll bet you forgot! Well.... Such lovable old men. Your father seemed like a kind man. Think so? Are you happy you got to meet him? Not really. Wasn't there something you wanted to say to your father? Nope. Not at all. So proud! What? Oh, look, larks! Say Inuyasha... Huh? I thought that Sesshomaru didn't like people, but maybe it's not so. I'm sure he hates them But Rin is by his side all the time. Who cares about that? Oh yes! Inuyasha, sit up! C'mon sit up! What? I have something nice for you. What a pain... Please, close your eyes. Geez... Okay, open. Huh? Arghh! What is this? Not the Beads of Subjugation again! You said something nice! You were thinking of something nasty! L Like what?! I knew it! I don't need this thing! Don't you trust me? Sure I trust you. But I don't want you going off alone again. I won't! Hey! Take it off! Nope. Take it off! Sit boy.
