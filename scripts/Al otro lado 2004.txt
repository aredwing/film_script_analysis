Prisciliano! Come on, immediately! Come out! Haven't I told you not to swim in the lagoon? We were in the shallow part. It doesn't matter, you can drown! I can swim. I don't care. What if Erendira goes out, and takes you! My dad told me she doesn't exist. Chubby you can do whatever you want... ...but leave him alone. Let's go! Take your things and let's go home! - See ya, skinny! - Don't call him skinny! Fucking chubby! Who's Erendira, daddy? Come closer, son. Well, son... ...a long time ago... ...when the Spaniards conquered Tenochtitlan... ...they came to Michoacan... ...and among them... ...there was a captain, he was a very tough man... ...so, one day... ...when this captain was walking... ...in the forest with his menu. ...they felt somebody watched them... ...so, the captain looked up the hill... ...and he discovered... ...a very pretty girl looking at him... ...and... ...that was Princess Erendira! The daughter of the Purepecha King. The captain didn't know that... ...but he was pretty sure... ...that he was in love with her. Ho followed her everywhere she went. But Erendira didn't care. She was very cold... ...until one day... - ... guess what! - What? Well, the captain got tired... ...he caught her alone... Who followed her to the wilderness... ...and guess what! He kidnapped her! And to ensure that no one could find her... ...he took her to a very beautiful valley... ...in the middle of the mountains... ...with green com fields... ...there he hid her... ...very little time went by... ...when the Princess realized... ...nobody would find her... ...and she got very sad... ...so she cried day and night... ...crying her eyes out! Forming with her tears... ...the Zirahuen lagoon... ...where... ...she threw herself, commiting suicide. Some sorcerers that were over there, some wizards... ...saw everything... ...and to save her from drowning... ...they turned her into a mermaid. Why didn't they try to rescue her? I think they didn't know how to swim. It is said that since that day... ...she lives inside the lagoon... ...and when the sky is gloomy... ...and the fog appears. ...it means that Erendira will come out to search... ...for a bad man... ...one of those... ...who don't know to court... ...a woman with nice words. It is said that she tears... ...their hearts out and takes them... ...with her. That's what they say. So, you'd better not enter the lagoon. Mom, did you know there's... ...a Princess living in the lagoon? - Those are trifles! - No, my dad told me. That's why the children can't sleep! He really wanted to know the story. Come on, finish your soup and go to bed. - Mom, when is my birthday? - In three days. Dad, on my birthday. can you take me to the fair? - We'll see, son! - Can my mom... ...and my brothers go? Okay, but finish your soup! Angel of God, my guardian... Never this day be at my side... ...to fight and guard and rule... ...and guide. God bless you, son. Take care of your mom and your brothers. You're the man of the house. Dad, can Princess Erendira come into the house? No, my son. She just takes bad men. You're a good boy. Can you wait 'til his birthday? I can't. Why did you promise to go... ...if you weren't going to do it? What else could I do? Tell him I won't take him cause I'm leaving? t's better to tell the truth. Bullshit! Can't you see he's just a boy? He won't understand. What he isn't going to understand is why... ...his dad left without oven saying goodbye. Are you leaving? Don't go, Rafael! Don't make it harder, dear. You know I do it for you! What am I going to do by my self? Don't do that! Look... ...just think I'll bring back a lot... ...of dollars to build a house. And that I'll take you for a ride... ...in a big American truck. What if something happens to you? That won't happen... ...'cause you'll pray for me every night. Let me go! Dad! Let me go with you! No, son! Get back inside! Good morning, dear! I'm sorry to bother you but... ...Rafael asked me to give you this. If you need something, you know... - ... you can count on me. - Thank you, uncle. Take care! Where's my dad? He went to the other side, son. Which other side? Far away from here. But don't worry, he'll be fine. Come. Prisciliano! - Dad! - Prisciliano! Dad! How are we going to find my dad? You don't know who he is. Yes. I have his photograph. Very nice. My mom says he's very famous. All right, everyone knows famous people. I don't wanna leave Cuba. We're not staying. Let's go, you find him... ...and you talk to him... ...he grabs his suitcase and we return to Havana! What if he doesn't want to? I think you don't want to go. If you're afraid, you'd better say so. I rather play domino. What's up! Are you winning, Manuel? Caridad! Marcos, how are you? Allis set... yes... ...we'll be there in 20 minutes. That son of a bitch! Take care, beauty. Where were you? What's wrong with you? I went for a walk with my friends. Why did you get here so late? I went out, that's it. I don't have to explain anything! Goto sleep, it's very late. How much did they pay you? THINHERIR, MOROCCO. Dad, dad, dad! Oh, how nice! You have to learn. Mom, when is my father going to return? Soon. You always say soon. I think he's never going to return. Don't say that! Your father is working on Spain... ...so we can have something to eat. I don't remember him. How long has he been gone? t's going to be 7 years. Couldn't he come to see us in 7 years? No, he couldn't! Stop asking! He'll come when he decides. Is Malaga far from here? A little bit. It doesn't matter. I'll go for him. All right, help me with your brothers' dinner. Fatima! Fatima! What's your name? Fatima. And your parents? My mom is in Tinherir and my dad is in Malaga. What are you doing here by yourself? - I'm going to get my father. - To Malaga! Do you have somebody to take you? I'm going by my self. My dad is waiting for me at the other side. You must be careful. Here, in Tanger. ...there are very bad people. A policeman didn't allow men. ...to board to the ship. That's an example, but you're lucky... ...because maybe I can help you... ...I have a friend who has a ship. Really? Yes. He has take me to Spain many times. Free of charge. Ho's a very good person. Who's your friend? His name is Rashid, he works over there. Do you want to go with him? Okay! I'm taking you just because I like you. Wait here. How old are you? Ten. You're so beautiful! I wanna go! Everything's fine, he's my friend Rashid. ...the owner of the ship, remember? We'll have to wait a little... ...because if the police sees you... ...they'll want to catch you. We're staying here for a while. Come, join us. Look, you're lucky. You won't travel alone, they'll go with you. Why are they imprisoned? They aren't, they're waiting. You'll soon see you father. Don't worry, you'll see your father. To the north, our country... ...borders with the United States... ...of American. ...to the south, with Guatemala and Belize. Let's see Martinez. Martinez, I'm talking to you! Tell me, to the north... ...with which country does Mexico border? With Pachuca. Pachuca? Pachuca? You ass! That's a point off to being a fool! Hi. Are you angry? It was a joke, my favorite team is Pachuca... ...so I thought... Do you want me to leave? My dad left us. What? When I woke up today, he wasn't there. He left with his lover! That happened my aunt Virginia. She was exchanged for an 18 years old woman. My mom said that he went to work to the other side. Everyone goes there! Do you know whore that is? Me? No, but maybe he'll return soon. Did he take his clothes or not? I didn't see, I just saw that my mom had his hat. See! He has to come back for it. My dad says that a Mexican can't go out without his hat. Did you see that? What? Over there! What? Over there! Look, what do you see? - Is that the other side? - I think so. Dad! Mr. Rafa! Don't be rude, return! Mom! I know where the other side is! - Who told you? - I guessed it by myself. That's good, son. Help me with the clothes. Masa and I were shouting at my dad and guess what! He answered us and he told me he'd be back... ...for my birthday. Son, I told you, your dad is far away from here. Not so far! Look Percito! Your dad... ...isn't going to return so soon... ...so please realize we're not... ...going to see him in along time. But he told me he would take me to the fair! That's not going to happen. If you want... ...I'll take you and your brothers to the fair. Come, help me with the clothes! What's up Prisciliano? What are you doing hero? I wanted to know if you can tell how I cross... ...to the other side? Do you wanna go with your dad? Damn boy! Have you listened? He wants to go with his dad to the other side. You're too young for that. Too young. But as soon as you grow up, I'll tell you how. I'm almost nine! Who do you think convinced your father? Who? Your uncle Guadalupe! He's an asshole, he didn't want to go... ...and I told him Rafael... ...what the hell will you do here? You've got to go for dollars like me. ...and what happened? The fucker is on his way! I told him... Such is life! We have to work hard. Work hard. Look at Apolinar. The idiot thought it was easy... ...and crossed at night... ...the border police caught him, right? That's right. Yeah! And grouchy old Primitivo. Fuck off! He crossed on the freight trains. - He's more clever. - That was long time ago. Longtime ago. - Now, it's fucking difficult. - You must think it over. They suffocate, because leave them locked... ...in the freights! Aureliano, that bastard you see over there... ...dumb ass, crossed through the desert. That's the way it is. It was my fate. And he almost died. They found him laying there by chance. - And you, how did you cross? - What? How did you cross? Me? What then. - Swimming, son! - Swimming? Swimming! I always beat those American bastards. There are some who try... ...without knowing how to swim... ...so the fucking idiots drown. Mr. Guadalupe, the child can't be here. Let him drink a beer with us. Can't you see he'll go to the other side? Where were you? Come here! Quickly! Look at you, you're so dirty! Wash your parts. Tomorrow, you'll help me. washing the clothes you dropped, Ok? You're old for that nonsense... ...if you don't help me, who will? I don't wanna be the man of the house! I don't care, you wanted to be nine! Eight! I'm not nine yet. Whatever, raise your arm. Come on. Jump. I must be back early... ...I have to buy the bread! One. ...two... ...three. - Are we almost there? - Almost, soon you'll seen. ...the Statue of Liberty appear. Are you sure we're not gonna get lost? Sure, pal! Don't you trust Elegua? He'll show us the way. Help! Walter! Walter! Caridad! Angel! Where were you? Do you want more rice? - Where are your shoes? - I lost them. How could you lose them, kid? Caridad! Is Walter over here? No, he didn't come here. Oh my god! Where can he be? t's late and he doesn't show up. Have you seen Walter, Angel? I'm talking to you! He said no. Don't worry, dear. He'll appear soon. Look how late it is. I'm desperate. I'll be at my house. If you know something, let me know. Sure, Mercedes. Aren't you hiding something, Angel? No, no! You have to tell mom. You have to. You have to tell my mom! You have to tell my mom! You have to! You have to tell my mom! It comes from an Ifa. He says there is a loss. That means that a head can hit the ground. But not my son, right? Fuck, Betis has lost again! Everything all right? Yes, Esperanza, here they are. Freshly arrived. We said seven, right? Yes, but one suddenly appeared. And who decided that? I don't know. I guess Rashid... ...put her in the last moment. How the hell could he do it? Who did he ask? Don't be like that! He told me you can give him whatever you want... ...just take her! Which one is it? The one at the end. The fair skinned one. She's just a kid! How old is she? I don't know. Ten, eleven. You know some people like girls this age. It will be easy to place her. That's wrong. I don't trade with girls that young. You must be kidding, huh? I'm being absolutely serious. I'm not taking her. Hey, wait! What do I do with her? t's your problem, not mine. Talk with Rashid, we had nothing to do with this. I asked for seven girls and I take seven, is that clear? That bitch needs to be fucked! Girls, up! We're leaving! Come! You stay here. I wanna go with my daddy. I wanna go with my daddy! She must be around eleven... No, no... fair skinned... Her skin is soft. Her face? Nice, sure. And her body is very cute. The girl looks delicious! You will see her. She's exactly what you want. Okay! it's a deal! I'll deliver her in one hour, monster! We must take her to Banus. Fucking great! See you later! You prick! Where are you taking her? We told you it would be easy. Let's go! What's going on? Nothing. I'll take her. You didn't want her. fuck off! She is ours. Don't touch her, son-of-a-bitch! She leaves with me... - ... and we'll talk later. - How much will you pay? I'll talk with Rashid. He'll tell you if he wants. Fucking bitch! - Now what? - What? - Fuck you! - Fuck you! You could use a bath, huh? Let's see. You crossed to Spain. We're here, in Spain. Where do you come from? Where do you live? Malaga! No, how could you? You came from Morocco. Where are you from? Is your dad in Malaga? And you want to go with him. Fuck! What do you want me to do? Take you? No, no, no! No way! I wouldn't take you even if I was crazy! No, sweetie! No, no, no. Excuse me, do you know this man? Maybe I do. But I'm not very sure. - Let me see. - And you? I think I've seen his face. Maybe he could be working near here. Hey! Excuse me! - I'm looking for this man. - Abdul. Do you know him? He's inside. Let me call him. Wait! Are you sure it's him? Yes, Abdul. Okay. Tell him somebody is waiting for him. Sure. Stay here, okay? - We found your dad! - My dad? Yes. You stay here, my child. Don't move. I'm gonna park the car, okay? God bless you, girl! What's up? I know how to gets the other side. - Are you nuts? - My uncle Guadalupe told me. - They won't let me. - We'll back soon. Let's go another day. No. It has to be today. Tomorrow is my birthday. My father will kill me if he catches me. Yes or no, chubby? - Here! - What? You have to row. Yes, sure! I don't know how! Me neither. What can we do? You do it on one side and I'll do on the other. Okay! The water is getting in! What shall we do? Jump! Skinny! Help! Help! There he is! Prisciliano! - Son! - Look at you! Is the boy alright, Vicenta? Damned! Who the hell told you to do that? Prisciliano wanted to see his dad... ...and I went with him. There, son. Don't believe that. It isn't lack of love... ...on the contrary... People leave their homeland... ...because they want the best... ...for their family, for their children. And here, well... ...we can't. But sooner or later, all of them return... ...because the land call and here is our family... ...our sons... ...and, in the end, that's all we have. Don't get sad, son. Your dad is gonna return soon. Do you believe me? Angel of God, my guardian... Never day be at my side... ...to light and guard... ...and rule and guide. Take care of baldy, the baby, my mom... ...and dad, so he can return soon... ...and me also, so I can take care of all of you. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Go to sleep, baldy. Once again, Martinez? Can you tell me which is... ...the river that divides Mexico... - ... and the United States? - The Rio Bravo, teacher. Grandpa, do you know how to swim? Well... ...I haven't done it in along time. But yes... ...yes, I know how to do it. Why? No, no. it's nothing. Grandpa... ...how long can one last under water? Not much. Just a few minutes. Good afternoon! Are you Walter's father? Yes. No! Walter, no! Walter, no! Why are you running away? It wasn't your fault... ...nothing's gonna happen to you. I just wanted to go with my dad... ...so he could return with us. Oh, my goodness! That father of yours... ...doesn't even know you exist. He left me before you were born. You're only truth is me. ...and your grandpa... ...who is like your real father. That's all you have. And you're the only thing we have. Dad... ...why did you leave us? Who is this? - My daughter. - Your daughter? Who's she, dad? She's Eva, a roommate. What are you telling her, bastard? I'm explaining to her who you are. You'd better tell me. ...what the hell is going on? I'll explain it to you later. She's staying here tonight. Why is she dressed like that? Goto hell, mother fucker! Let's go home! Eva. We have to talk! Quit bugging me! I understand how you feel... I swear I was going to tell you. We've been living together for two years. And you haven't told me that you have a daughter... ...what else haven't you told me? Don't raise your voice! The child is asleep. I don't give a damn! Can't I even shout in my house now? Yes, you can. But she's not to blame for all this. So, than I'm to blame, huh? For being with a fucking Arab... ...who lied me from the start. What am I supposed to do? To put my head down like you, and give up? You're in Spain! Things are very different here. Don't be afraid. I'm not going to harm you. And you? Where have you come from? How did you get here? Eva. - ... I've got to go. - Don't tell me anything. Do whatever you have to do! I think... ...I'll be back. I don't know who will wait for you. Daddy is here! I brought you dad!
