Call... an ambulance. Holy cow! Is this the freaking Terminator? God damn! There're persuers! He Ying, accept the imperial decree. I have been upright and honest all my life. How would I do that? India, 1621 A.D. (1ST YEAR OF THE TIANQI REIGN) Golden Wheel of Time is a sacred object from Borneo. A Sindhu epic Ramayana says... 5,000 years ago, Borneo Prince Raju left his country to fight with devils. Before leaving, he promised Princess Same... to come back safely when the five stars aligned. But the war went on and on and Raju missed the day, Sama thought Raju was dead and killed herself. Raju knew the god Shiva loved rainbow Datura flowers, he then took good care of the plant and Shiva was touched. Shiva gave him "Golden Wheel of Time", a time travel tool, so that he could go back in time and stop Sama from killing herself. Golden Wheel of Time has been passed down among human ever since. Golden Wheel takes person back to the time when the five stars aligned. The five stars aligning connects the past with future. Turn Golden Wheel thrice and it will self-destruct. The tool works for three times only, rumor has it someone apart from Raju has used it once. Thus, please advise the Ming Emperor... to use the last shot wisely. What is it? It's called Linga in Sanskrit... believed to be Shiva's penis. Enormous penis? To activate Golden Wheel, you need to insert Linga... and recite the secret mantra. Ian Kwai Fong, Hong Kong, midnight. Ox-head! Horse-face! You bastards! Tell Death God that it's not my time yet! You want to lock me away? Not that easy, Horse-face! What's your problem? I'm just eating my noodles. May, don't go over! Don't bother him. Yeah. Royal bodyguard! Wing Lee Street, Sheung Wan, midnight. (INDIAN) Come on man, hurry up! (INDIAN) I'm on it right now, why don't you do it yourself? (INDIAN) I'm the boss, just do what I said. Yo, curry chicken! It's good. Milk tea, drink up! Stop running! Drop those manhole covers! Run! Officers under attack! Why are people nowadays so weak? Have martial art skills failed to be handed down? Give me back my curry chicken! Freeze! Freeze! This gun is powerful! I've been waiting for you, Niehu. Where've you been all this time? I'm starving. These are some serious boobies. Hey, I haven't read it yet! Let me read first. Your turn first again? You should give precedence to the young. How about He Ying? Let's track him down tomorrow. Wow! This one is even better! She's pantless! Help! Help! Hey, this way. Take a seat over there. Mr. Bodyguard! I just bought you noodles. Now I buy you a drink. All drinks on me tonight! Awesome! Thanks! Hey hero! It's so cool you kicked that guy's ass. Isn't it? That jerk never pays for his drinks. He deserves it. Bro... Later! Hey... People here are so licentious, they ought to be drowned to death. Excuse me, where are we now? Ian Kwai Fong. What year is it then? Who's the Emperor? Why must you ask? There's no emperor now. It's 2013. Let me tell you... You said you're from Ming dynasty... After Ming dynasty, there were... Ming Dynasty has fallen? And I've slept for 400 years? Young emperor never worked hard and corruption abounded. Heavy taxes. Brutal oppression. It's just a matter of time before rebels subvert the government. The late emperor had been kind to me I failed to protect my country. I pledge guilty. I failed to protect my country. Guilty as hell. Shau Kei Wan, early morning. This well water tastes salty and stinky. Wake up. A thief broke in! Wake up! He looks kind of familiar. Breakfast delivery! What are you guys doing there? Look up! Up there! Ying? Why are you up there? Ying, stop it! I'm not the fat guy you talked about! Damn you! India-China Border, 1621 A.D. Winter (1ST YEAR OF TIANQI REIGN) He Ying, accept the imperial decree. Hold it! Let's make this clear. He Ying, you conspired with Japanese pirates. How could you let us down? When did I conspire with Japanese pirates? You taught me sword fighting. Now I return the favour. What are you doing? Ying, our brotherhood ends here and now! Ying, you can't oppose to the Emperor's order. I hate people colluding with Japanese pirates. He Ying, accept the imperial decree. By the mandate of heaven, this Emperor decree hereby. He Ying, fourth-rank General of Royal Bodyguards, failed my expectations... and conspired with Japanese pirates... killing 76 lives in the minister of justice, Master Du's family, by extremely brutal means. Now I strip him of power and office. He will be handed for interrogation. Anyone who resists this order will be killed. Hitherto, by the Emperor himself. I have been upright and honest all my life. How would I do that? You speak up! It's you who forced me to conspire with the Japanese pirates. Damn you! You are clearly framing me for treason! I have to meet his majesty and clear myself of the accusations. Treason gets all your close and extended family members executed. His majesty is sending a squad of elite soldiers to Taoyuan Village for execution. Hahahau. Hahahau. The late Emperor in heaven... I, He Ying, can never let innocent people be killed. Forgive me for my disrespect. That's how the they got buried in snow. Did I miss anything? Ying? Like in "Back to the Future?" Chubby! Call me Slander. Mr. Slander, I was a bit confused just now... and used more violence than needed... You're forgiven. Liu Bang! I'll call Liu Bang for you. He sure can help. I'll call his son Liu Bei. Who should I call then? Call Andy Lau. Girls, are you leaving me? Are you leaving just like that? He's so pathetic... and you can't use up all this space yourself, why don't you let him stay? What's wrong with you? Did he crush your brain? He's a guy. How can I let him stay? Mr. Slander. I sincerely thank you for your hospitality, but it's getting late and I don't want to take up your time. Miss May, I'll forever remember your kindness for the lovely meal. Farewell. Ying, you're leaving just like that? How can you go out in that look? What look? Your appearance of course. Causeway Bay, afternoon. Are you missing a mirror at home? Stupid extras. Go to the TV station and ask for Oprah if you want a job. Hmm. Young man, give me a minute to discuss with you. What do you want? You bastards! I must learn martial art! Boss, you want to date a martial artist this time? Damn! North Point, afternoon. They bid up the price 50 times on that stupid dog head. I'm a rich man! 12 million Euros. Transfer HK$48 million to Mr. Tang's account immediately. Got it. Having a good partner is everything in running a business. Ever since I worked with you, I don't worry about a thing. By the way, let me ask you. Those three frozen corpses last time... They were alive, right? Yes, they were! Kim the North Korean wouldn't spend a fortune on them if they weren't. He's so obsessed with staying alive forever. But how did you know? The driver can't keep his mouth shut. He told you, right? He only told me after the accident. Not only did he tell you, but his girlfriend as well after drunk! Ask him. How many people knew about it? Ask! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! You said it right. Having a good partner is everything in doing business. So that I don't worry about a thing. Your own problem. Solve it yourself. Clean it up after him. A gift for you. Thanks Boss. Chan, Elderly Home Director. Hey May, you're looking hot tonight. You got a light? You shouldn't have done that. Hey! Youu. Miss May, you don't have to thank me. I've accepted your meal and I'm grateful. Last night you said you've been harassed, that's why I came to teach them a lesson. What the heck do you think you're doing out here? Eh... Hi Boss, eh... I don't know him. Hey you! Why did you beat them up? I only strike their acupoints. Look. They're fine. Is he your friend? He's not my friend! No matter what, you two are coming with me to settle this. I don't want everybody to see us fighting out here. What did this foreigner scold on about? Negotiation! Come on. Don't hit people anymore. Your boyfriend beat up the bouncers. That'll make trouble and it's not good for business. You have to pay them to settle this. What did she want? Money! Idiot! What's "idiot?" Hush and let me handle it. He's your problem, deal with it. You can calm down a little bit. Calm? Calm the heck! You foreign pig! Cursing others right from the start. So disrespectful! You manage your staff poorly and let them bully a decent woman, and dare ask for compensation? I'll pay fOI' You- I pay for her. Really? You're so generous! Is this enough? What's this? You joking? You haven't seen it before? Okay. How about this? You must've seen gold before. Sir, here's your cash. Thank you very much. Here you go. I'll pass this to my boss. And these are for you. Keep it safe. There are many bad people in Hong Kong. Don't flash the dough. You gave me all this and leaving yourself penniless? No, I still got plenty. Plenty? Look. Don't worry. How much have you got? Let's sell it all at once. There are many bad people in Hong Kong. Don't flash it. Excuse me. I want these two ingots in cash please. Stupid! Just one moment please. Sir, may I have the pleasure to take a look at your Jade pendant? If the accrued 3 months payment is not settled by tomorrow, we'd need your mother to vacate our elderly home immediately. This ancient Jade is gorgeous and the craftsmanship is exquisite. It's artisan jewelry of Ming Dynasty. It's an honour to have seen it. Why don't you sell it as well? How much will you pay for it? Miss, you must be kidding, right? How can shops like us afford it? Maybe Sotheby will sell it for you. This Jade pendant is worth at least tens of millions dollars. Tens of millions? To be honest, this Jade pendant was given to me by the late Emperor, I'm not selling it for anything. Here's your cash, sir. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. So long. Miss May, is there any hotel around here? Why are you staying in a hotel? You're treating me like a stranger! We're friends and you should stay with me. Well, I accept then. I'm afraid you wouldn't offer. Bring me some food. Make it quick. (INDIAN) Go prepare some curry dishes. Sao, these western weapons are so powerful, we must fire before our enemy does. Or else, even with our strength and agility, we can't dodge it if shot from within 3 meters away. What do you say? Let's use it on Ying. Boss. The curry... chicken spaghetti here is not bad. It's spaghetti chicken curry. Spaghetti chicken curry? Yes yeah! Yeah? Yeah! Ask all our people to find this man. (INDIAN) Everybody, come with me. We must find this man. You'd sleep here from now on. Hong Kong has little land but many people. Floor space is very expensive. I'll charge you a special rate of HK$5,000 a night. That's fine. I slept outdoors in the army. Now I have a roof over my head, I'm eternally grateful. It's good that you make do with it. Let me tell you. That's my room and you can't go in. Of course. But feel free to use all other spaces. Watch TV or a movie if you want. Just let me know if you need anything else. I know you need money. But don't go too far. Don't scam him because he's from Ming Dynasty, okay? That's not your business. All you have to do is to stay here for the night. Who knows what he'd do at night. Keep an eye on him. See? Don't even look away for one second. It must be a modern musical instrument. It sounds quite... dreamy. It is cutting-edge technology. An electronic keyboard. Miss May, so you like playing musical instruments? But now it's just here for decoration. I didn't put much effort when I was young. Now that I'm old, I can't even move my fingers swiftly. I guess I'll give up. I believe that, anyone can do anything with insistence and faith. Ying, you said a truck overturned and brought you here. I sought through all sources, but I don't find this piece of news. News is... Yes? Information from our government. What's this? A tablet. Just swipe it with your finger. You can almost find anything. What the heck. A small piece of metal that tells the past and future, so much stronger than our encyclopedia in Ming Dynasty. Can you find the clues for me with it? Absolutely. There is no entry on Tao Yuan Village. Let's search "Golden Wheel of Time". Ying can go back to Ming Dynasty if we find it. 600d idea. Miss May, quick. Qkay... Nothing on Golden Wheel of Time either. I guess Golden Wheel of Time was buried in snow just like me. How about... searching your name? Sure. How could they write such a thing? It's all nonsense. Those bastards! Hey. Come and read. He Ying colluded with Japanese pirates in the 2nd year of the Tianqi Reign. His close and extended family members were executed by the Emperor. The official historians commented him as the most treacherous official of Tianqi Reign. What should we do? In Wind-Wave pavilion; Yue Fei was framed. Azalea wept in bloody tears; Sorrows lingered on for thousand years. How ridiculous! I hope he's alright. Find a blacksmith and make this. Understand? Okay. Sao, actually... could the murderer be someone else? Impossible. There were only the four of us at Du's. Chubby admitted his crime. The evidence was crystal clear. There's nothing to discuss. Master Du, you invited us here tonight. Is there something you want to discuss? I got secret intelligence and seized a bunch of letters written to the Japanese pirates. There must be a spy in the army, selling out our intelligence to the Japanese pirates. If I find out who he is, I must tear him to bits! I hate Japanese! Letters were not signed. But we can find out who he is... if we compare the handwriting. Officers, General He, salute. How was it? Tell us. The money and food you ordered will be sent to... Taoyuan Village tomorrow. Good. Well done. 76 lives of Mr. Du's family were killed that night, and He Ying left the Capital the next morning. And the letters were nowhere to be found. That's some evidence, huh? He Ying, I won't let you off the hook! Where's my spaghetti chicken curry? Ms Kwok, we're so busy here. You don't answer calls or return messages. Your cheques were bounced. It's very impolite. I'm terribly sorry... I know you care for your mum. But you should do it within your means. If you need it, apply for social security. Of course the homes won't be of this class. The fourth wife of Mr. Ho came and asked if she could send him here. I couldn't even squeeze her a room. Director, please give me one more chance. This will be the last time. That's it. Thank you! Mum, you look gorgeous today. It gets cold these couple days. Do you feel cold? Let me know if you do. I made your favourite fish congee. You always made me fish congee when I was little, now it's your turn to try mine. Watch out. It's hot. Ah... Open up! Ah... Once more. That's great! You raised me up all by yourself. Taoyuan Village, 1621 A.D. (1ST YEAR OF THE TIANQI REIGN) Doing needle work every night which blinded you. You won't come with me to the Capital even I begged you to. I don't know what else to say. Silly! All villagers and I will be proud of you when you set for glorious homecoming in the future. Let go of my mum! Let her go! Uncle Seven, why did you hit me? What? I didn't. Mum, you're talking! What happened? Your mother suffered from Yin-Yang imbalance and crooked meridians. That's why she's unconscious. I just cleared the blockage in energy and blood flow for her. She'd feel even better if I do it to her a few more times. Thank you so much, please do that again some times. Will do. Mum, remember me? It's May. No, I don't. I just remember Uncle Seven stole my pig. Mother. In the name of heaven and the moon, I, He Ying, swear by my sword, despite all hardship, I must return to the Ming Empire... to protect Taoyuan Village... and save my relatives from being massacred. Breaking my vow, I must die with a million wounds, without a proper grave. My Damascus knife and my Cuban cigars! Qkay... I was deeply moved by your pledge to save the villagers just now, so I'll only charge you HK$20,000 for that. For your understanding, I express my deepest gratitude. We'll start investigation first thing in the morning, okay? Okay. International Commerce Centre, noon. Eat slowly. Take you time. What did you see that night? I saw that guy pee, long range. Not just ordinarily long range, but very freaking long. He flew high. Not just ordinarily high, but very freaking high. From this moment on, you've seen nothing. If that guy shows up, give him a call. Qkay... Don't be wasteful. Finish all food before you go. The Divine Monk said, General He was destined to have major mishaps. What kind of mishaps? You'd live and die, and live again. In 7 days, the five stars will align. Your life will see major changes. That means it'll happen very soon. No. It takes a long long time. Here are the 7 Datura seeds that were passed down... with the Golden Wheel of Time. The Divine Monk decides to let you have them. They are brought to you by fate. Someone will move Mount Xumi... with his small but strong will. When that person successfully grows Datura flowers, miracles will happen to you. A cause is the effect. An effect is the cause. You sow the seeds, You reap the fruit. Whether it's cause or effect, it all depends on your Karma. Seeds from 5,400 years ago, do they still sprout? Come on... May. How come you didn't show up for so long? Mum, you recognise me? You think I'm crazy or something? How can I not recognise my daughter? Uncle Seven, your Jade pendant is so pretty. When I die, will you let it be buried with me? Well, you'll live long and I'm afraid that won't happen any time soon. The Divine Monk told me I must experience 7 mishaps. I've experienced... life and death. There must be a reason for me to be here. I need to know what fruit I'd reap. I believe the seeds... will sprout very soon. How do you know? You told me, miracles happen... as long as you insist. Sai Yeung Choi St. Mongkok, night. Delicious! This curry chicken is really good. Chicken? Chicken. Curry what? Curry fish ball. Curry fish ball. Curry... Curry fish ball. Whatever. Curry... Curry fish ball. Are we anywhere near the brothel yet? You seem so horny. You won't understand how it feel not having make love for 400 years. Let's warm up by talking with the girls first. You can do whatever you want in the room later. The girls here... do they play music and dance? Not music. But they know how to blow. I bring your favorites... Tina and Vincy. Hi. Excuse Me, do you have girls with paler, smoother skin? Of course I do. I'll go look for you. You come here. And look for more. Come sit over here. Bosses, they are pale and smooth enough, right? Xixi and Wenwen, say hi to the bosses. Hi bosses! They are pale and smooth, but I want... their waist to be... less wide, ...more skinny. Sure, I'll go and look. Hey come over. This one is hot. Xixi, go. How are you, boss? I'm Xixi. Bosses, I bring you the most wanted girls in store. This is Ada, and this is Ching. Not bad. Hello. Hello. (JAPANESE) Good Evening, I'm Ching, Nice to Meet You. Japanese frail! It's time to pay back what you owe our nation! I hate Japanese! Sao! Stop it! You Japanese frail! Calm down, Sao. You crazy! I'm Chinese! I'm not doing business with you! By the way, what about Sora Am'? She belongs to the world. Are you ready? Okay. Five. Five. Ten. Twenty. Let me play with you. Alright, you gotta have some more to drink. Yeah. You're wasted. Let me. Hong Kong Police Headquater, afternoon. We're trying this new face recognition system developed by NASA. CIA is also using it. It's very expensive and we haven't got the budget approved by Finance Committee yet. The system divides a person's face, features, proportion into 147 sets of data for analysis. It's connected with the Cisco super computer. We can track and monitor all close-circuit cameras owned by the government, and the cameras on the walkie-talkie of all constables. A match of 80% or above means it's very likely to be the same person. The system will instantly find out the location of the target. Good morning, sir! Sir! Find these three guys for me. Sir, the system is for those on Police wanted list only. How did you know they're not wanted? Can't they be wanted even if they're not on the list? You have to know all internal intelligence? Should I report to you from now on? These guys killed our officers in Sheung Wan. It's a major loss of face for the police. We have to play it down. Okay? Understood. Input the info at once. Yes, Sir. I don't want to stay here. I'm just waiting to die. I'm not sick anymore. I remember you. You're Uncle Seven. You're May. Mum, be a good girl. You haven't fully recovered. Stay here, okay? I'm fine. You don't have to take care of me. There's someone dying here every day. It's a haunted place. It's a haunted place. I close my eyes and I can't fall asleep. Oh. What now? What now? Let's see how you behave. If you stay here being a good girl, so that May doesn't have to worry, I'll give it to you when you get better. Uncle Seven, you can't lie to an old woman like me! I'll keep my promise. I'm a royal bodyguard from Ming Dynasty. Mum, Uncle Seven won't lie. Really? Of course. Okay, let's go back to my room. Uncle Seven, when I have my vacation next week, I want you to make lamb dumplings. What ever you like. So happy. I want lamb dumplings. Be good! Tolo Harbour Highway, night. Mister, your home address please. Don't bother me. Get lost. Station, it's 5007, over. What is it? Sir, target seen on Castle Peak Road, near Lingnan and Fu Tei sections. Tung Chung golf course, morning. Professor Wong. Commissioner Cheung. I kept reading the Sindhu epic Ramayana you mentioned last time. But I didn't have a clue. It's simple. Shiva is one of key Hindu deities. His penis is called Linga, which represents creativity and power of life. According to the epic, Shiva copulates with Madhura for 100 years. The deities saw his vigor and virility, suggesting that... he squirt his sperms in Ganges, so that land around the river would be fertile. As Linga symbolizes holy power, I'm sure Golden Wheel of Time... has to be activated with Linga. Thanks, Professor. Who is it? Huh? Take action as soon as SDU arrives. Hey. It's Pang. Eh... I heard the horse called Terminator, the horse owner said go ahead. Hey. In cash, okay? We must win this time. Yes. Is that your toilet? Let me use it. I nailed him. He's locked inside! Action. Go. Give me cash. Cash! Hang in there. Fire at will. Cash! Holy cow! Holy cow! My place is covered in faeces! Over there! Damn it! Hong Kong Transport Department. License Plate Enquiry input number: Searching... What are you doing? Didn't you say the Jade pendant was from the Emperor? I promised your mother I'll give it to her. I'm just keeping my word. Thank you. When we first came to Hong Kong, we had a really hard time. As soon as I spoke Mandarin, everyone would stare at me. Discrimination really hurts. Back in my days, if you use a different dialect... in the Capital, everything is marked up by 20%. We are weird xenophobic beings. When we come across people who are different from us, we join forces and bully them. It's human nature. Years later, I pretended to be overseas Chinese living in Hong Kong. Now that I think about it, it's just ridiculous. I lied... just to make more money... for my mom's treatment. I just wanted her to live a good life. Don't blame yourself. It's destiny. Your mother is a happy-go-lucky kid. I'm sure up there in heaven, she still wants you to live on happily. Right? This is Uncle Seven. Do you want May to live on happily? Don't just laugh. Tell her yourself. Mum, I promise, I'll live on happily. Louder! You morn doesn't hear that well. Mum! Can you hear me? I'll live on happily! Don't worry. Your daughter will live on happily. Legislative Council, morning. Since the implementation of minimum wage, countless number of shops and restaurants closed down. How tough it is to stay afloat? Owners are thinking so hard that our hair turns gray. Without us, where can workers find a job? In a progressive society, those capable are not supposed to subsidize those incapable. Speak. Sir, target location, Legislative Council. Those not capable enough to live here, go back to mainland. Or rotten to death! Help! Help! Someone's after me! Mr. Tang, get in the car. Mr. Tang, please wait here. Commissioner Cheung is rushing back. How can you serve me drinks from canteen? Go get a latte from Starbucks for me. I want it low-fat. Wan Chai Police Headquarter. Attention please, all officers. Please pay attention to a Chinese man... wearing red shirt and black blazer. He's of medium build with shoulder-length hair. He was last seen at LegCo Building. This man is very danger. Attention please, all officers. Please pay attention to a Chinese man... wearing red shirt and black blazer. He's of medium build with shoulder-length hair. He was last seen at LegCo Building. Oh, sorry. Thank you. High Ranking Officer Lounge. Officer Szeto, what are you doing? What did you eat? Hey, it's not me. Hey! Where's my latte? My latte? Hush! Be quiet! Does it hurt? Well, it should. Why did you send me to Hong Kong? I don't know what you're talking about. Then why did you run when you saw me? You look hideous and violent. It's only natural to run. Are you bluffing me? So? Ouch! Give me a minute. I'll ask deities to possess me. I'm not afraid of you. I beg Taishang Laojun, urgently and righteously. Guandi please show your true self. Oath of the Peach Garden; Loyalty and justice last forever. My face and my heart are red; My beard is long and my righteousness is even longer. I'll use my Sinew-splitting and Bone-dislocating trick on you. Your meridians will mess up, muscles twitching, sinews grinding against bones. No one can ever stand this gruesome torture without telling the truth. Guandi, here I come. Executing Yan Liang; Killing Wen Chou; Passing 5 gates... This freaking hurts... Ouch... This freaking hurts! Forgive me for using too much force. Excuse me, Guandi. Guandi is gone. So, who sent me here? Someone told me to. Who? I can't tell. I'll get killed if I do. He's Cheung Yat-ming, Deputy Commissioner of Police. He's a partner of my smuggling business. Sir, I'll use Gazetteer to lock on the target. Good. Speak. Commissioner Cheung, we located the target. Where? In the VIP lounge, Police headquarter. Back to the headquarter. Help! Help! Thrust harder. Have you guys not eaten? Listen. Block all exits. Don't let a single soul in or out. Yes, Sir. Idiots! You want to crush my head? Are you okay? Why did Cheung Yat-ming unearth me? I don't know. I was only responsible for transporting the three of you here. There are two more? They look just like you. Where are they now? Where's Golden Wheel of Time? Do you mean the Sindhu Saucer? The rear exit of East Wing is sealed off. Commissioner Cheung, he's holding Mr. Tang hostage. We dare not break in. Idiot! Were you born yesterday? Idiot! Were you born yesterday? What did he ask you? I said nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing? Aren't you scared of pain? Ian Kwai Fong, late night. Have you seen him? No... Get lost! Hi everyone. Anyone knows this hero? I owe him money and want to repay him. Cash reward of HK$10,000 for anyone who finds him. I can't sleep well when I'm in debt. What? Cash? I don't believe it. Pass it over. Hey, he looks like your boyfriend. Nonsense! Don't crack jokes on things like that. Look closely, is he your boyfriend? Oh yes, this is definitely your boyfriend. It's really him. No way. You're drunk! You're drunk! That's him, why don't you admit it? Don't make a scene. Drink. Me first. Ten. Ten. Five. Fifteen. Ten. Twenty. Twenty. Ten. Ten. You are... He Ying! Who's phone? Hey midget. Stop messing with us. Give it back. Is this yours? What the hell? You think I'd budge because of your scary face? Come here if you dare! He Ying, you show up at last. Get lost. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! They're closing on us! Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery, dawn. A mantra? Why didn't you mention it earlier? I almost killed him! It's a new discovery. Queen Mary Hospital, dawn. Miss, what's your relationship with the patient? I don't know him. I saw him pass out on the street and took him here. Please follow up on this case. Okay. Please come over. I need to write down your personal particulars. Sure. Sir, target found. 100% match. What's happening to these two? Fever this moment. Hypothermia the next. The blood test is even stranger. They don't have antibodies for epidemics occurring in the past few hundred years, just like space aliens. Nurse? Give them shots of the strongest antibiotics Vancomycin. If they have abnormal response, give them this tranquilizer too. Okay. Hey fat woman. Prescribing Vancomycin? You don't think it's too strong? I'm afraid it's some strange contagious disease like SARS. My house will be worth much less if property prices dive. Cheung Yiu-Fai, please report to distribution station. What're you doing? Have you saved my brother yet? Who's your brother? The one I sent here just now. If you can't save him today, I can't save you either! Keep your hands off me! We have to save every one of our patients. We have a fair medical system here, we treat every patient without discrimination. Each and every life is equally precious. Got it? Doc, calm down. None of your business! Doctor, then when will my brother wake up? An hour later. This one's for you. With beef patties. Food is not allowed here. You either get out of here and stuff your face... or sit here quietly and wait. Don't yell and scream. Okay? Thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome. Okay. What're you looking at? Keep walking! Nothing to see here. Get back to work. What's the matter, officer? Wong Fung-Yee, please go to Room no. 2... Hold on a sec... Junior. Yes? The two patients just woke up. Give them a shot of tranquilizer. Okay. There's so much work to do here on the 4th floor. Wake up! Wake up now! Wake up! Water! Give me water! Quick! You... you're that... Sir, these are the two injured. This is an extremely dangerous criminal. I need to take him with me. Yes, sir. How about this one? Just an illegal immigrant. You escort him to detention centre. Yes, sir. Wake up! Wake up! Those assassins hunting after you are right outside. Wake up! I'll take the personal belongings of those two illegal immigrants with me. The girl with He Ying is here. He is definitely here too. Oh, he woke up already? Where's the other one? Tell me. How to give him an instant boost of energy? Sleep early. Wake up early. Eat regularly. Sunbathing. Drink more water. This is your main artery, right? That's adrenaline. What is it? It's called Linga in Sanskrit... believed to be Shiva's penis. Enormous penis? To activate Golden Wheel, you need to insert Linga... and recite the secret mantra. Golden Wheel is offered to Ming Emperor only, you can't disclose this secret to anyone else. Please rest assured. I swear on my life that I won't let anyone know the mantra. Damn you! Where's Linga? Linga? The police took it. Let's go. Sir, all done. Niehu, there they are! It's show time. KEY Follow them! Get on! Quick. Commissioner Cheung, target has left the hospital, running toward Tsuen Wan West. Bring me Linga. Yes, Boss. Commissioner Cheung, target reaches the Tsing Ma Bridge.

Are you nuts? Hey, Wake up! What the heck? Shut up or I'll beat you up! Oh my baby! He Ying! Give me a hand. Look. There's a horse. Hey... Look. Don't be afraid. Let us out! Give me a hand. Look at him. Don't worry, things will be alright. Help! He Ying, your arm is crippled. How are you gonna fight? Sao! Come on, let's go! Quick! Niehu! Be careful! He Ying! He Ying! He Ying! Stanley Prison, three days later. Yuanlong! He's alive. I got secret intelligence and seized a bunch of letters written to the Japanese pirates. There must be a spy in the army, selling out our intelligence to the Japanese pirates. Indian border, Winter, 1621 A.D. (1ST YEAR OF THE TIANQI REIGN) Yuanlong. Why did you kill Yanyin? Why did you kill Yanyin? Niehu! Sao! You conspired with Japanese pirates. What will become of us all? I've been upright and honest all my life. How would I do that? Intelligence found out the murderer used your unique weapon. He Ying, not only did you betray our country, but also our brotherhood. We've been the closest friends all our life. I can't believe you're such a stranger to us. Yuanlong. Here. He Ying. Here. Niehu. Sao. Yunnan Dali, 1616 A.D. (44TH YEAR OF WANLI REIGN) Build inner power in lower abdomen. Squirt! Who doesn't know we're the longest range pissers in the Capital? That's right! Damn right! And the strongest, bravest fighters too! Done? Let's go. Brothers, let's go! Go! Go! Three months later. If this saucer really is a time machine, you and I will go first. But will it change the history? If we go back to Ming Dynasty, would it still be the Ming Dynasty we know?
