Who couldn't be happy with Melody Allen? She's adorable. Oh, Cuthbert. Uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Do you recommend this vintage, my man? Oh, yes, it's delicious. That is, so the other guests have told me. So, Master Cuthbert. Up to your old tricks again, I see. Oh, Nora, just a nip or two. But I'd even give that up if... I know. If I'd marry you. You could become the biggest teetotaler in the Colonies, and my answer would still be no. But, Nora, I have saved up enough money to pay your bond to Master Danbury. Why, you'd be a free woman. No, thank you. I'd rather be bound to the master than tied to the likes of you. So! You're still in love with that little, fat, stupid tinker. Little he may be. Fat? There's nothin' wrong with an extra pound of flesh. But stupid? Hmph! You'll never see the day when you're half as smart as my Horatio. I'll say he's smart... persuading you to punch holes in all the master's best copperware. 'Tis a lie. That was my own idea. Nora! Nora! He's comin' up the road! Who? Horatio, my darlin'? That lazy fat tub. Lazy, is he? Why, he's the most wide-awake tinker in the Colonies. Hello, tinker. Hello, Mr. Grant. Hello, Mrs. Jones. Horatio! Horatio, my darlin'! Oh! Lancelot! Ahh-choo! Wahh-choo! Horatio. Horatio? Horatio, where are you? Nora! Nora! Saints preserve us. Oh, Nora. I had a terrible time getting here. I got lost east of West Point, and I was held up north of South Ferry. And at Barton's Barn, I had a "bitish" with the "Buttish. " A what? A British with a brish... A brush with the British. And I was shot. Where? Right through the saddle. The devils. Nora. I'd never go through that again for anyone... except you. Ooh. Ohh! Ohh. N-Nora! Oh, Horatio, do my kisses thrill you that much? I'm sitting on a pitchfork. Oh! Oh, well, for heaven's sake! Here, here. Well, get up! Nora! Nora! Get it ou-ou-out! Nora! Nora! Nora! Nor...! Ooh-ooh. Food. Nora, for me? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Tinker, I've missed you so much. I've missed you too, Nora. Here. You take the first bite. It'll taste sweeter. Okay. Oh, Horatio, 'tis happy I am to see you. Cuthbert's been pesterin' me again. Oh, he has, has he? Wait'll I see him. I'll haul off and give him the dirtiest look he's ever had in his life. No need of that since we'll be leavin' here tomorrow. Why so hasty? Hasty, is it? Tinker! You've not got the money. Well, you see, Nora, things are very hard, and folks can't pay me. When I first started the trip, I had a pound, 14 shillings and six pence. Then I found that a lot of my customers were badly off. So I bought them food with my pound and 14 shillings. What happened to your pence? I lost 'em in a card game. Oh, Horatio, you've failed me. Oh, Nora. Don't worry. I'll get the money. Business is gonna boom... now that I got a personal letter of recommendation from General George Washington. From the general himself? Yes, I have. You wouldn't be after tellin' a tale now? Oh, no, Nora. I got it right here. It isn't everyone that can get a letter from General George Washington. "Know all men by these presents... Mm-hmm. "that the bearer of this letter, Master Horatio Prim, That's me. "is a splendid artisan... "whose very skills have served the Continental forces well. "I take great pleasure in recommending him... "to all who need the services of an excellent tinker and a true patriot. "Yours truly, George Washington, Commander-in-chief of the United Colonies. " Oh, Horatio, now there's nothin' to stop us. Let me take this to Mistress Melody. When she learns you've been praised by General Washington, she'll help us elope... tonight. Stay here, my darlin' tinker. I'll be back soon with good news. Hmm-mmm! Nora and I are gonna elope. We're gonna get married. And why not? Yes, why not? I'm a very good friend of General George Washington's. Mmm. Whoo-ooh Mice. Good evening to you, Master Tinker. I don't want any trouble with you like I had the last time. I only came to congratulate you. Congratulate me? Well, yes. Nora's told me all about you and she eloping. I think it's splendid. You do? I thought that, that y-you... Yes, yes, yes, I know. It's just a case of the best man winning. Oh. Odsbodkins! You're not such a bad fellow after all. Now, Horatio, I know that eloping with Nora means breaking her bond. But I think there's something that you can do... There is? that would put you in well with Master Danbury. What, for instance? Well, now, this trunk he wanted to take on his honeymoon. He was terribly upset when he found out he'd lost the key. Now if you could open the trunk, I could put you in very good. Well, I could try. Ah, now don't be so modest. I know all about that letter from George Washington. George Washington. Yes. Uh-huh. I'll open it. Watch this. Fine. Now, uh, raise the lid. No, no, the lid of the trunk. Oh. ByJupiter, I do believe there's a hole in the bottom. There's a hole in there? Ooh! Ooh-ooh! M-M-My foot! I'm sorry. Horatio, go in there and see if it can be repaired, eh, old boy? Are you sure this'll get me in good? Oh, I'll see to that. Let me outta here.! So you were going to elope with Nora O'Leary tonight, eh? Well, we shall see what happens when Master Danbury finds out... that you've talked an innocent little girl into breaking her bonds. Nora! You'll get yours. You'll get five years in prison at hard labor. You penniless stinker. Melody, darling, I'll have another surprise for you after we're married. Oh, but, Tom, you've already promised me the moon. What else might a lady expect? How would you fancy a title, my dear? A title? Lady Danbury, for instance. How does it sound to those lovely ears? Sir Thomas and Lady Danbury. But, Tom, after the war, there'll be no titles... in our United States. But, my angel, what if after the war, there should be no United States? What are you talking about? Melody, darling, would you mind going in by yourself? I'll join you shortly. Of course, Tom, but all this strange talk... this nonsense about titles. What does it all mean? Please, dear, I'll explain later. Cranwell. Hello, Tom. Hello, Tom. Leigh. Glad you're here. Bessie. Bessie! Let go. I'll keep her from tinkering with that tinker. So she was going to elope, eh? I'll tend to that. Go back in the kitchen. Master Danbury, I must see you at once. Sorry, Cuthbert, not now. But, sir, this is very important. Confound it. Get out. Get out of here. But, Master Danbury, if you'll only let me explain. Well, gentlemen? The news. Is it good or bad? It's good. Very good. Major Andre, the king's representative, met with Benedict Arnold last night. Arnold has consented to surrender West Point within 48 hours. Excellent! It means the end of the war. Washington and his rabble can never recover from such a blow. Congratulations, Tom. Your plan has worked perfectly. Our friend Benedict has requested that you personally come to West Point... to help him arrange the final details tonight. Hold on. I thought I saw something move. "Yours truly, George Washington. " Who is this Horatio Prim? Where is he? I'll not be tellin' you that, even if you cut my tongue out. We'll take care of him later. There's enough evidence in this letter... to hang your rebel friend when we've won the war. Oh, Master Tom, you... a traitor! You spying little hussy. Get rid of her. She's heard too much already. Let go of me! Nora.! That Cuthbert.! Oh, I hate that Cuthbert.! Put your hands up. Put your hands up! Speak up, fellow. Who are you? Horatio Prim, the tinker. Oh, Prim. You're Nora's sweetheart. Yes, ma'am. Thank heavens. I need help. What do you think I need? Would you please get me out of this overcoat? Ooh, that Cuthbert. I just learned that the United Colonies and General Washington are in great danger. You and I have to save them. My friend General Washington in danger? Yes, yes. That's all I gotta know. Get me outta here. Do you know the location of the nearest Continental Army post? Yes, ma'am. Saddle those two horses while I finish dressing. Whoa, Lancelot. I'll be right with ya. But, sir, when did they capture this spy, Major Andre? Early this morning. We found some papers in his boot exposing the whole foul plot. And some of them were signed by Master Thomas Danbury. Master Prim, we must get through. If anyone tries to stop us, we'll shoot. Here's a horse pistol. This is for you. What do I shoot with? This is no time to jest. We must go. Mistress Melody, I wanna tell Nora that we're goin'. Nora and I plan to elope. I don't want her to worry. Oh, but, Nora... She wa... Oh, I'm sorry, tinker. I'm afraid there won't be time. I'm sure Nora'll understand. Hurry. I guess so. Tinker, here come some of Tom Danbury's friends. The back road. There go two of the traitors. Lieutenant, surround the house! Yes, sir. Neither one of these men is Tom Danbury. They're dirty traitors just the same, else they wouldn't have been shooting at us. - What'll we do with them, sir? - Throw them in the well. That's the only burial they deserve. Yes, sir. Hear me, ye faithless souls. May you lie there in everlasting torment... with but one name to identify your rotting bones: "Traitors. " And unless some evidence proves us wrong, I curse your miserable spirits... to be bound to Danbury Acres... 'til crack of doom. Amen. Here you are, Major. Good. G-G-G-G-Ghost. Oh, no, it's me, tinker. Odsbodkins and spotty widgeons! Am I glad to see you, Mistress Melody. Oh, am I happy now. You know what I thought for a minute? Only a minute, mind you. I thought you were a ghost. Me, a ghost. I thought you were a ghost! What did you do? I didn't do anything. My hand... That's funny. I'm still thirsty. Tinker, there's something very, very wrong. You can say that again. Look. "Here were buried two traitors. " Good! I wonder who they were. Look at the date! September 23, 1780. That's today. That's right, tinker. What's the matter? That looks like us down there. Yeah! How can us be down there when us are up here? Do you remember when Master Danbury's friends tried to stop us? Yeah, and they even took shots at us. I'm afraid they killed us. They killed us? Why? We didn't do anything. Soldiers. American soldiers. A-And those people. It looks as if they were looting the place. What does all this mean? There's just one answer, one terrible answer. Those soldiers were pursuing us, and we mistook them for Tom Danbury's friends... and they mistook us for traitors. Traitors? Me, a traitor? I'm a patriot! I even got a letter from General George Washington to prove it. Uh-oh. I gave the letter to Nora to give to you. Nora? That must be the letter that Tom took from her before she was kidnapped. Kidnapped? Kidnapped! Kidnapped? Nora? Who are they? Where are they? I'll tear them gizzard from gullet! Tinker! Wait for me! Come on, you old nag. Get up. Get up. Get up. Come on. Lancelot! Cuthbert! Come back with my Lancelot.! Lancelot.! Lancelot.! What happened? I don't know. I can't get through. Something's wrong. Wait. "Hear me, ye faithless souls. "May you lie there in everlasting torment... "with but one name to identify your rotting bones: 'Traitor. "' "And... "unless some evidence proves us wrong, "I curse your miserable spirits... to be bound to Danbury Acres 'til crack of doom. " Then you heard it too. Oh, I thought it was some horrible dream, but it wasn't. We're bound to these acres forevermore. We can't get away. But he also said unless some evidence proves him wrong. Evidence? My letter from George Washington! That's evidence! That's right. Tom must have hidden it somewhere in the library furniture. Furniture? This is a fine time to think of furniture. Mistress Melody, the patriots took it all away! Well, don't give up. Maybe he hid it behind some secret panel in the wall. Yeah. Yeah! Great Beelzebub and little Beelzebub. Look! Now we shall be here 'til doom cracks. Mistress Melody, why didn't you get Paul Revere to help you instead of me? Oh, I'm sorry, tinker. It's all my fault. Forgive me? I think we'd better go back to the well. Do you mind? Uh-uh. This is the first time I've ever put my arm around you. That's right. Melody. Yes? We've been up in this tree for 165 years. Yes. And never once did I... What? Never... Melody. Yes? You have beautiful eyes. Oh, my little tinker. Melody, there's just one thing I want to ask you. Oh, yes. If I... Oh, what is it? Melody. Yes? No, I can't. It sounds foolish comin' from a fat man. Oh, no, Horatio! Tell me. You really wanna hear it? Yes. Melody, would you... Would I what? Would you scratch my back tonight? See, it didn't take so long. That's right. And yet, no one would know we're anywhere near civilization. Ain't that the truth. Here. Careful now. Don't look yet. I want you right back here. Now! There she stands. Danbury Manor, exactly as it was in 1780. Come on. I can hardly wait to show you the inside. Shelly, this porch is a dream. Should be. It was designed by the famous Jonathan Bullfinch in 1760. Why, Shelly, you mean we have servants already? Why, absolutely. The local employment agency sent us a housekeeper. Hello, Emily. Afternoon. I'd like you to know my fiance, Miss Prescott, and her aunt, Mrs. Dean. 'Lo. 'Lo. Decorators left last night. Said to tell you... they got all the rooms fixed like it explains in the book. Great! Hang on tight, darling. We're going into the 18th century. Oh, is this trip necessary? Oh, uh, pardon me, but didn't I see you in Rebecca? Hey, kids, wait for me. Oh, Shelly! You like it? Oh, darling, it's wonderful. Don't you think so, Millie? Oh, it's out of this world. Don't know whether you realize it, Mildred, but this happens to be the very furniture... the Danbury family used 160-odd years ago. Someday I'm gonna... That must be Doc Greenway. I've invited him up for the weekend. Oh, dear Dr. Greenway. That's all we need to complete the picture. Ralph Greenway happens to be one of the best psychiatrists in New York. I'd better go down and let him in. Millie, please! I wish you'd stop making smart cracks. You're beginning to upset Sheldon, and he's not entirely well yet. Now Ralph said... "Ralph said. " Last week he said the rash I had wasn't an allergy. It was caused by a guilt complex because I kicked your Grandma in the bustle when I was two years old. I can hardly believe my eyes. Absolutely miraculous. Ralph! It's good to see you. June. Mildred. It's good to see you. Nice to see you, Doctor. Quite an accomplishment, eh? Quite. Has Shelly told you I hit on the idea of restoring this particular place? No, do tell us. Well, it's part of my family history. 160-some-odd years ago, my great-great-great grandfather, Cuthbert Greenway, was a butler on this estate. - Really? - From butler to psychiatrist in six generations. - Now that's democracy for you. - Pardon, Mr. Gage. This was delivered this morning. Oh, yes, a plaque for the well. Look, honey. It's very impressive. Strange. In all these years, no one ever discovered who those two traitors were. Hope the ghosts don't throw this one over the fence too. - Ghosts? Did you say ghosts? - It's just a legend. The ghosts are supposed to hurl their memorial stone over the fence every so often. Yep. Last time was Fourth ofJuly. Put Mayor Hathaway in the hospital for two weeks. Hit him in the head with it. Interesting case, isn't it? I think we'd better get this placed on the well before dinner. I'll get some tools. Let me go.! I'm gonna throw that plaque over the fence. Oh, stop it, Horatio. What good would it do? They'll only put it back. Then I'll throw it back over again. I don't want all those people comin' up here and sayin': Here lie the dirty traitors Here lie the dirty traitors Oh, pooh. I'm used to it. Well, I'm not. Besides, it only happens once a year... when they have the Fourth ofJuly picnic. But did you hear what that man said? Every Saturday, they're gonna open up the place to the public, between 2:00 and 4:00. And I'm not gonna stand for it. But, darling, what can you do about it? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make them sorry they ever rebuilt that house. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna haunt 'em. That's what I'm gonna do. Hm-mmm Horatio! Horatio! I always forget to do that. Well, you'd better forget the whole thing. No self-respecting ghosts do any haunting until midnight. Oh. All right. I'll wait. But tonight, I haunt. Psst.! Ooh! Don't do that! You almost scared the life out of me. Oh, I'm sorry, but I was lonely up at the tree, and I got frightened. Please let me stay down here with you. Well, all right, but don't try to stop me. My mind is already made up. Can't believe it. It's exactly the same. Let's go in. We can't. Everything is locked. If we wasn't a couple of outdoor ghosts, we'd know what to do. Why don't we try to go in the same way as we go up and down the tree? You know. Here I go. I don't think she made it. Come on. It's easy. I'm stuck.! Melody! Ohh. I didn't make it. Horatio, won't you ever learn? I'm sorry. Come on. Thank you. Why, it's amazing. Horatio, look at this table. A-And the sofa. I'll light a candle. How could they have known what it was like? Don't work. Glass around the wick. Look. What'd you do? Well, blow it out. B-B-Blow it out? Go on. You blow it out. Uh-oh. Why... What an astonishing idea. They probably got it from Ben Franklin. He's always inventing things. Be calm. Be reasonable. You see? There's nothing to be afraid of. I've changed my mind. Let's go back to the well. Not yet, Horatio. This is fun. I'm scared. Oh, really! "Memoirs of Thomas Danbury, Esquire. " What? Thomas Danbury's memoirs! His grandmas? "With a repentant heart, I dedicate these memoirs... "to my country and to Melody Allen, whose love I betrayed for vainglorious ambition. " Speakin' of the devil, there he is. It's a perfect copy. But he belongs in the library. And we belong back in the tree. Let's go. Oh, don't be such a fraidy cat, Horatio. This is the first pleasure I've had since 1780. The harpsichord! It looks exactly the same. Don't touch it. Something's liable to happen. Oh, nonsense. Why don't you be like me? I'm sensible. I'm sensible too. And I'm brave. I should've quit when I was even. Why don't you pull yourself together and practice what you preach? What was that? Number, please. Spooks! What's the matter? That thing over there just talked to me. You're just imagining things. That note always did stick. Shh! Somebody's comin'. Sheldon, is that you? Quick. Unmanifest. For heaven's sake, hurry up. Cuthbert! Melody, it's Cuthbert, and he's still alive! How can he be? I don't know. They say only the good die young. Odsbodkins! I'm still showin'! Melody, I don't think he can see me. Are you sure? Take a look. Watch. See ifhe can hear you. Whistle. Horatio, this is wonderful. Have I got an idea! What's the matter with me? How do you like that, Master Cuthbert? Ha-ha, ee-ee, zounds! What well did she come out of? Melody! Emily. Aren't you the playful one. Emily. Emily! Dr. Greenway. Did you hear it too? Hear what? They're here. Somebody must have done something to offend them. Offend who? Them. From the well. The ghosts. Oh, nonsense. There's no such a thing. You hear 'em? They're laughing. No, no, no, no, no. You'd hear 'em if you were psychic like me. Emily, when you came in here, did you or did you not kick me? Why, certainly not. Uh-oh. Oh, you felt something, eh? Uh, uh, I-I... I thought so. It's you they're after. No. You must have annoyed them playing that harpsichord. Harpsichord! Uh-oh. Uh, Emily, if I were you, I-I wouldn't say anything to the folks about this. They don't understand this psychic business like we do, you know. They might think you're a little bit, uh... You understand. Best you go up to bed. Good night, Emily. Good night. Good night. If you want me, all you gotta do is whistle. Harpsichord. Ha-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo! Oh, this is the happiest day of my life. So, Cuthbert Greenway is now Doctor Greenway. He'll need a dozen doctors before I get through with him. Horatio, come quickly.! What now? This picture. That's your beloved Tom. This is the original painting. I'd know it anywhere. Look at the artist's name: Stuart. So? And that harpsichord. That note "A." It always did stick. Hmph. This is the original too. I-I can't be wrong. Do you realize what this means? It means they were stuck with a lot of old furniture. Don't be so stupid. It means they found all the original furniture. Perhaps in this house, at this very moment, is your letter from George Washington. My letter? From George Washington? Horatio, if we find it... It'll prove that we're not traitors. Then we'll be able to get away from this place at last. Where'll we look first? In the library, of course. That's where Tom had it. Come on. Let's search the library. Nora! It won't be long now! Melody, when you said "secret compartment," you meant secret. I can't find a thing.! Melody, do I have to do all the work around here? Oh, my, wasn't I lovely, Horatio? Course, I'm in the wrong place. We're both in the wrong place. If we don't find that letter, we're never gonna get out of here. Be patient with me, Horatio. Be patient. Do you realize that my girlfriend Nora... has been waitin' for me for 165 years? And a girl will only wait so long, and no longer. All right. Let me see. Desk, books, chair. Clock. Have you searched the clock, Horatio? The clock? Melody, in my day, I was the best tinker in the Colonies. There's one thing I know absolutely: No one ever put a secret door in a clock. We simply gotta find that letter. Please help me? Come on. I don't seem to remember this piece. Uh-oh! Oh! Okay, Phantom, we gotcha covered! Stick up your hands. And this time, don't try disappearin'or we'll fill ya full oflead. Mister, whoever you are, don't get violent. There's his little playmate over there. Get your hands up, sister. Come on. Get 'em up. Better get 'em up. They sound awful mad. Okay, Phantom, we wanna know who tipped ya off. Start singin'. I'm... I'm not in good voice tonight. You heard the boss. Sing. Come on now. Sing. Drink to me Only with thine eyes And I will Cut the stallin'. Pledge. Pledge with mine What's that? The cops.! Blow.! Everybody, blow.! Go on, boys. Let 'em have it.! Melody. Melody! M-Melody! M-Melody! Don't ever leave me alone! Oh, be calm. Be reasonable. Sounds like the radio. Well, it can't be the Revolutionary War. Listen again tomorrow night to The Phantom Hour. How does the Phantom and his lady escape? Like this. Wait... Wait for me. And now, Midnight Dan brings you a half hour of popular dance tunes. Oh, the idea of Shelly playing the radio this hour of night! I can't understand it. I tell you he's off the beam again. Shelly! Well, that's a fine place to take a nap. Shelly. Shelly! Darling. Oh, Millie, he's hurt. Call Ralph, quickly. Dr. Greenway. Dr. Greenway. Dr. Greenway. Dr. Greenway.! Emily... E-Emily, for heaven's sake, turn off the radio. Oh, darling, what happened? Oh, my head. Oh! Let's get him into the library. I'm all right now, dear. Thanks. Oh. Oh, there you are. For once, you'll really come in handy. They're in there. It's stuffy in here. Talk plainer. I can't. You got your foot in my mouth. Come on out, Horatio. It's all right now. Look. Oh, I'm sorry. Let's look for the letter tomorrow night. I'm tired. But this is our perfect chance. They're all in the library. We can search the whole interior. Yeah. You take the up-terior, and I'll take the down-terior. Be calm. Be reasonable. Oh, stop it, all of you! I keep telling you I didn't make this mess! The radio woke me just like it woke the rest of you. I came down here to turn it off. When I reached for that doorknob, something, some invisible force, yanked it open, and then I was met by that gust of icy wind. Don't get excited. I'm not excited! I keep telling you there was nobody there, and I got bopped on the head with this candlestick. Moving under its own power. Wait a minute, Mildred! Millie. I'm telling you exactly what happened. Don't stand there lookin' at me as if I'm crazy. I'm just as sane as Ralph. That's what I'm afraid of. You're overwrought. You're imagining things. No, he's not. It's them, all right... the ghosts from the well. They're up to their old mischief, throwing things around. Oh, there's a curse on this house, all right. Ghosts! They must've been a couple of interior decorators looking for a little overtime. If I were you, I wouldn't make fun of them. They don't like that. Really? Maybe she's right. There are many strange legends about this house. Couldn't it be possible that some forces from the world beyond... Oh, let's stop all this. It's nothing but hysteria. Sheldon had another one of his sleepwalking spells. He came downstairs and turned on the radio. Now doesn't that sound like a sensible explanation, Ralph? Well, I, uh... It was the ghosts. I know they were here. And so does Dr. Greenway. I think we all need a stimulant. Where's the brandy, Emily? In the living room. I'll get it, I'll get it. Cuthbert! Come on! I tripped you.! I tripped you.! Why... Why, I just... I just swore I... No. No, this can't happen to me. No, it's impossible. It's a trick of my subconscious mind. I... I-I-It's all wrong. It just can't be. It... Oh. Now be calm. Ralph. Ralph! Be calm. Be cool. Uh... Don't get excited, Ralph. E-Everything is all right. These things can't be. It's, uh... Thank you. But, darling, I told you 50 times, I wasn't... Sheldon! Sheldon! Ralph! Ralph! What's the matter? You're a bad boy. I'm sorry? I knew you were up to something. Now you run along. We have to find that letter. All right. Well, go on! I'll go. Go on. Hurry up. Hurry up. I'm going upstairs again. Mistress Melody, I'll go down into the cellar, and... Mistress Melody. Mistress Melody! No tricks! No tricks! Ahh. Oh, ifTom could only see me now. Come on, Ralph. Be calm. Be reasonable. Ohh! Keep 'em away! Keep 'em away! They've got a grudge against me. Ohh! Come on, Ralph. Tell us what happened. Oh, bottles floating through space, glasses filling up by themselves, and somebody tooted in my stethoscope. See, you didn't believe me. Maybe now you're willing to concede there's something odd going on. No, I'm not, Shelly. You've merely communicated your hysteria to him. Yep, yep, yep, I hear ya. - Oh, get her. - I hear ya callin' me. Ghosts of the well, lead me to you. Wait a minute. Better leave that here. We need it much more than the ghosts do. The ghosts of the well? Why should they want to persecute us? Maybe they got an eviction notice and want to move in on us. Well, you people can stay up all night babbling about ghosts, but the charming Mrs. Dean is gonna hit the sack, and I'll take my spirits with me. Hello. Millie.! Millie! Millie, what's the matter? Oh! Oh, Shelly, help me get her into the living room. I was coming up the stairs and that thing... How did this get here? Oh, hurry, darling. I-I'll take that. Millie. Take it away! Take it away! That dress! It's haunted! I saw it coming down the stairs all by itself! I did! That's impossible. It is, huh? How about that hit I got on the head? Yes, and what about the tooting in my stethoscope? Oh, stop it. Stop it, all of you. I-I can't explain about the dress or anything else, but I do know there's nothing supernatural about it. And if you don't all stop acting like a bunch of crazy neurotics, I'm going to start acting like one myself. Oh, well, listen, honey... Uh... M-M-Melody! Melody! Melody! Oh, Horatio, stop that! Melody! Stop that! Let go of it, Horatio! Pull harder.! Horatio, let's get back to the tree. I'm afraid. Come on. Ohh! Oh! We'll think more clearly in the morning. We'd better. I'll not spend another night in this house. Look. Now do you believe there's something supernatural going on here? I don't know what to believe, but whatever it is, it's terrifying. Ghosts of the well, come back. They've gone. You've frightened them. We did? Yep. They've gone back to the well, all right. And we're going back to town, first thing in the morning. Oh, June, please. You've got to help me figure this thing out. Come on, darling. No. I don't care what Emily says. I'm not taking part in any sance. I've had enough. But, darling, isn't it better to try to find the truth? Let me read you something. This is the record of a Major Putnam who shot the two traitors. He says, "Then we tossed their bodies down the well, and I cursed their miserable spirits to be bound to Danbury Acres 'til crack of doom. " If it's anything at all, it must be those two poor devils. They can't get off this property. But, Sheldon, that's sheer medieval superstition. Shelly is right, June. As a psychiatrist, I've got to agree with him. If we all intend to keep our sanity, we've got to get to the bottom of this. If a sance... And that from a man who wrote a dozen articles exposing all sances as fakes. Please, Mildred. Please, both of you. Let's do what Emily suggests. If this sance doesn't work, I swear I'll give up the whole thing and go back to New York. Is that fair enough? Oh, all right, Sheldon. That's... That's a deal. Thank you, darling. Go ahead, Emily. Now, put your hands on the table again, little fingers touchin'. And we've all got to make our minds perfectly blank. Well, that should be easy for you. It is. I... Anelot dos mirabus piret cotar. Nimbus et nosticus lazum bodar. Did you feel that? Yes. Something's happening. It must be them people down at the house. They're up to somethin' again. Oh, something's pulling me! Me too. Hang on. Hang on! Hang on! Th-Th-The windows. I can feel their presence. We didn't mean any harm. Won't you please let us go back to the well where we belong? I promise we will never bother you again. Oh, please let us go back to the well. Whaddya say? Anelot dos mirabus piret cotar. Nimbus et nosticus lazum bodar. Oh, thank you. Thank you ever so much. Did you hear what that nice lady said? What did she say? Oh, be quiet and listen. They're here. Spirits of the well, we know the curse upon your souls. We only wish to help you if we can. Horatio, did you hear what that charming young man said? They want to help us. It's a trick. I don't trust 'em. Let's go back. If you wish to cooperate with us, rap on this table. Once for "no," and twice for "yes. " Horatio, go on. Do as he says. Maybe they can help us find your letter. My letter? Yeah. Yeah! Anelot dos mirabus piret cotar. Nimbus et nosticus lazum bodar. Spirits of the well, can you hear me? Can you hear me? A-Are you willing to help us? Are you the spirits of the two traitors? Ow! Ralph! Don't you call me no traitor! You... Why... Why do they always pick on me? Perhaps it was your question that offended them, Ralph. You're right. I think you've hit it. Are you trying to tell us that you're not traitors? Then who are you? What are you? Identify yourselves. Cuthbert Greenway, you know who I am. I'm Horatio Prim, the tinker. This is Melody Allen. We were on our way to warn General Washington about Benedict Arnold... Horatio. Don't be silly. But I gotta... Don't you realize they can't hear us? Who are you? Who are you? Who am I? How am I gonna tell him who I am if all I can do is rap yes or no? I've got it! Follow me. They're goin' away. I feel 'em. They're goin' away. Well, don't think it hasn't been interesting, because it hasn't. How about a nice game of gin rummy? Millie, sit down. We're going through with this experiment. Emily, try calling them back, will ya? Shh. Spirits of the well, come back. Come back! They're here. They're here. Look! Melody Allen! Go on. Get back under the table. They're trying to tell us that one of the ghosts is Melody Allen. I don't understand. They're both supposed to be men. Are you trying to tell us that one of you is Melody Allen? Oh, now we're all confused. Who is the other one? "Who is the other one"? I keep tellin' ya who the other one is. It's me! I wonder how we can get him to tell us who he is. If we knew what their profession was, that might give us a hint. Yeah. You've got it there. Wait a minute. Are you a soldier? No. A gentleman? Why not try that old rhyme? The one that has all sorts of people in it. You know, "rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief. " June, that's a great idea. Spirits of the well, listen to this rhyme: Were you a rich man? Poor man? He was a poor man. Well, then, doctor, lawyer, Indian chief won't apply. Uh... How does the rest of it go? Oh, "tinker... " Wait a minute. He's a tinker.! Danbury mentions a tinker right in here. Let's see if I can find it. "The shame I experienced because of my treasonable activities... "was increased threefold when the maid, Nora, "wrote me and asked for information concerning one Horatio Prim, her fianc, who was a tinker. " Nora. Oh, Nora. She did worry about me. "He had disappeared from the manor on the night of the fire, a similar fate to my beloved and innocent Melody. " Oh, Tom. "I bethought myself that this must be... the selfsame tinker whose letter of recommendation... " A letter of recommendation. "From George Washington... I had taken forcibly from Nora and hidden in a secret drawer. " Uh, wait a minute. Just a minute. Then if the tinker had a letter from George Washington, he couldn't have been a traitor. You see? We're right! See that? Don't tell me we're gonna spend the rest of the night trying to contact George Washington! Don't you understand? They've been looking for proof of their innocence. That letter. Of course. That letter would remove the curse from them. Horatio, they know! Isn't it wonderful? I did it! I did it! Oh, boy, we'll be outta here in no time! Well, Sheldon, the original furniture is here. All we have to do is find that drawer that Danbury mentioned. Yes, the drawer. Perhaps they know. Yeah. I wonder. Let's ask them. Mistress Allen, Master Prim, where is the secret drawer? Do you know? Odsbodkins and copper pots! That's just it. We don't know, do we? Anelot dos mirabus piret cotar. Nimbus et nosticus lazum bodar. There she goes again. Must be number one on her hit parade. Shh, Millie! Please, answer me. Have you any idea where this letter may be hidden? Go slowly. Slowly. We can't understand you. M-M-Melody. That ain't me doin' that. No. No! No, no! L-Look. I d-don't wanna scare you folks, but that ain't me under the table. Melody. Melody. H-Her voice is changing. Oh, it's Tom. My Tom. You were gonna marry her? Melody, my beloved. It's Tom. I've come to help you. Oh, Shelly. What does it mean? It... It must be Danbury speaking through Emily. Oh, fine. A ghost-to-ghost broadcast. H-Horatio, why can't I see him? You can't. You poor kid. You see, he's got his wings, and we're still grounded. Master Danbury, we wanna help Miss Melody. Tell us, where is the secret drawer? Start at 12:00, turn twice to 3:00. At 10 past 1:00, 'twill open be. Would you mind repeating that last part? He is gone. He's gone. His brief span on earth is over. Tom! Tom! But, Emily, Emily where is the secret drawer? Secret drawer? I'm sorry. I can't tell you anything else. Good night. Start at 12:00, turn twice to 3:00. At 10 past... Now he's got it! You bet your life I've got it! 12:00, 3:00, 10 past. That could only mean a clock. The letter's in the clock. But there's over a dozen clocks in this house. What do we care? We'll search every one. Let's get started. Don't get excited. Melody. Melody, they've got the answer. The letter is hidden in the clock. Tom only had that letter in the library. The library clock! Yeah! Yeah! Hooray! Well, don't just stand there. We've got to let them know. Oh! I gotta tell Nora. Nora! I'll be with you soon! Won't I, Horatio? Odsbodkins! We're all mixed up! Whew! Melody, don't ever do that again. I'm a boy. Hurry. In the library. Cuthbert. Whaddya want? Nothing. Cuthbert! Whaddya want? Nothing! Mr. Gage. What do you want? Nothing. What do you want? Get them to look in the library. That's what I'm tryin' to do! I have an idea. Come on. It isn't in this one. The library. They're trying to tell us to come into the library. Yeah, you're right. They must mean that clock. - Oh, no. That's not the clock. - Yes, it is. But, Shelly, they directed us here. I'm sorry, but that isn't the clock. That happens to be one of my reproductions. The original's in the museum. Go to New York and search the clock. That board of directors won't talk to me. They barred me from the museum. Darling, do you suppose they'd let me examine it? They wouldn't let anybody touch that clock. That's fine. Let's give the ghosts a 99-year lease and move back to Park Avenue. Darling, I feel so sorry for them. Well, so do I. What can I do? I'll get the clock. I'm the logical one to do it. Why you? Has it ever occurred to you why I'm the main target of these ghosts? Your ancestor. That butler was an old so-and-so. That's exactly right. He was. There's every possibility that he did Horatio Prim wrong. Yeah, it could be. If that's the truth, this is my chance to atone for the sins of my forefathers. I think you're right. I'll leave first thing in the morning. Horatio! Ho... Horatio, listen to me. You don't have to tell me. Oh, yes, I do. Let's go back to the well, Melody. You don't understand. Dr. Greenway is going to the museum to get the clock. He's gonna do that for us? Yes, he's trying to make up for what Cuthbert did to you. For what Cuthbert did to me? Mm-hmm. Odsbodkins! Mm! Melody, he's a nice man. I'm gonna thank him. Wait a minute, Ralph. Hold this and I'll get another candle. Oh, sure. Thank you, Dr. Greenway. Thank you. Millie! My dear Dr. Greenway, I know you by reputation, but I repeat, we cannot allow so valuable an antique to be removed from the premises. But, Professor Dibbs, can't I at least examine the clock? Sorry, Doctor, but that's contrary to our policy. I told you it was only a pair of shoes. Sorry, madam, regulations. Oh, sorry, sir. Anything under that coat, sir? Uh, only me. I've gotta watch my diet. My! 4:00. How time does fly. And so must I. Bill! Bill! Hey, Bill, the Queen Anne clock is missing. That guy. Stop, thief! Stop, thief! Professor Dibbs! Professor Dibbs! Get me the police department immediately. Hurry! 5:00. I don't understand. The museum's closed by now. Ralph promised to call me. Relax, darling. Our ghostly friends have waited a century and a half. A few more minutes won't make any difference. This is a mighty fateful moment. Even the ghosts are worried. I know. I can feel 'em. They're right here in this room. Yep. Yep. I guess I'd better make some more tea. Ghosts. Ghosts. That's all she talks about. Oh, uh, pardon me. Is this chair taken? Thank you. Th-Thank you v-very much. I think I'll stand for a while. Oh, that's Ralph at last. Come on, Millie. Uh, excuse me. Melody, this is it! He's here! I forgot to do it again. Lieutenant Mason, state police. Oh, how do you do? Is Dr. Greenway here? Not yet. We're expecting him. Fine. We'll wait. Is anything wrong? Your doctor friend stole a very valuable clock from the museum. Stole it? Yeah. Connors. Yes, sir? Drive our car out of sight. Don't want Greenway to see it. Right, sir. Lieutenant, if you'll come into the living room, I think I can explain this. Poor Dr. Greenway. Is he in trouble! What about us? If they catch him, they'll take him and the clock before Mr. Gage has a chance to search it. Odsbodkins! What do we do now? We've got to keep him away from the house. Hurry, Horatio! Ghosts? What do you take me for? A chump? I know it's hard to believe, but we can prove it. Horatio. Melody. Horatio! Melody! Horatio.! Melody.! Horatio. Ah! We'll be back in a minute! Hey! Hey! Dr. Greenway! Stop! Stop! Dr. Greenway, it's a trap! Don't go in there! Stop! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! Dr. Greenway! Dr. Greenway! Don't go in there! It's a trap! Oh, Horatio, he can't hear us! We must stop him. Psst. Psst. Dr. Greenway, the police are in the house. Uh-oh. Go hide in the stable. Thank you, Emily. Thank you. Mason! Lt. Mason! Lt. Mason! Dr. Greenway's car. Where is he? I don't know. Look for the clock? No. Now, if I can only remember how that rhyme goes. Start at 12:00. Uh-huh. I have it. Start at 12:00. Yeah. You gotta stop that noise. Somebody's gonna hear you. Do somethin'. How's the rest go? How does the rest go? How do I know? I got it. Turn twice to 3:00. Lieutenant Mason.! Hurry, Horatio! They're coming! Turn the hands of the dial. Okay. Melody! The letter! Hoo! Hoo! It went in and out! In and out! In and out! It's gone. Did you see it open? Yes, I saw it. It was there. Dr. Greenway, the drawer was open! The drawer was open! I don't know... Zip! Dr. Greenway! I'm not kiddin' ya! Stick up your hands. With thine eyes And I will Pledge. Pledge. Pledge with mine It would've been cheaper to buy a watch. Come on, Greenway. Oh, hurry, Horatio. Get the clock. Okay. Oh! Oh, come on, Horatio. Hurry up and come on. I had it right in my hands! I know, but come on. We'll get it. Come on, Horatio. Come on. If you'll only listen. We know the letter's in that clock. Yeah? How? Tom Danbury's ghost told us so. That's all, brother. Get in. Don't worry, Ralph. We'll get the best lawyer in New York to defend you. And you can always plead insanity. You know how. It wasn't me. It was Horatio. Horatio, huh? Gonna give me some more of that... Come on. Let's get outta here. Hey, what's the idea of jammin' on the brakes like that? I didn't touch the brakes. I suppose I did it! Come on. Let's get goin'. Well, what's the matter now? I don't know, sir. Something's holding us back. I'd better get out and find out. Horatio. Horatio! They stopped. Shelly. June. Don't worry, Dr. Greenway. As long as we're in here, they can't get through the gates. Horatio, do you think you can work this contraption? Why? The well. We could hide the doctor and the clock there, until the police leave. Hey, what an idea. Now let's see. He turned it with this. He pushed that. And stepped on this. Aw, you've blown your top. There's nothing the matter here. Get in the backseat. I'll drive. Okay, Lieutenant. Now get in! It's supposed to run the other way.! Push the handle down. Whoo.! - This is fun. - There's nobody at the wheel. Hey, Greenway! Stop that car! Get outta the way.! Close the gates! What do I do now? Look out! Melody.! It's headin' for the well. M-Melody. - Oh, Horatio. - A fella could get killed doin' this. Odsbodkins! Whoa! Well, how are we gonna explain this to the chief? Ah! So you tried to get away, huh? No, no. No, no! Ralph, you all right? I don't know yet. Ralph. The clock! Shelly! Shelly, here it is! - The letter. - Melody! They got it! They got it! Now do you believe us? Well, right now, I'll believe anything. But will Chief Callahan believe me? No. Now the curse is ended. This proves they weren't traitors. And their spirits are no longer bound to these acres. They're free. Free. We're free. We're free. Melody, what are we waiting for? Come on! Wait a minute. Here, Lieutenant, this is yours. Thanks. I'm... Well? Well? Well, there's nothing to be f-frightened of. Mistress Melody, ladies first. You go. I'm out! You made it. Melody! I... Melody. Melody! Oh, Horatio. There you are. Thank you. Melody. Melody. Oh, it's Tom. My Tom. Good-bye, Horatio. I'm going to miss you. Good-bye, Melody. I'm gonna miss you too. But don't you worry. Just as soon as Nora and I get settled, we'll have you and Tom over for dinner. I'll have Nora bake a nice, big angel cake. Horatio. Here I am, Horatio. Nora! Nora! Horatio. Here I am. Nora! Oh, Horatio. You've waited for me. It's been a long time. Now that I'm here, nothing can keep us apart. Let me in. I can't, Horatio. Why? Odsbodkins.
