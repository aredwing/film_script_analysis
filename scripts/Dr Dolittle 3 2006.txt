Yeah, don't even get this dog started on the females! Just something about the way a girl sips her latte... ...that gets me a little hot under the collar. But enough about me. Let's talk about why we're here: ...the Dolittles. Maya Dolittle is not the doctor, the daughter. You see, she's adjusting. She's going through that weird period... ...that every one-in-a-trillion girls go through. It's not every day a young woman wakes up... ...and realizes she can talk to animals, and we can talk to her. I thought you said you actually had your license? Just chill out! Everything's under control now. Just don't kill me before the party tomorrow night! I burned the dopest CD for everyone to freak to. - Oh, my God, I just had the best idea. - What? You should totally have a birthday party at the end of summer... ...and we'll make sure it's off the chain... ...and then you'll be part of the "A" list with me! I don't know how to tell you this, but you've been more of a "B" lately. Which would make me a "C" at best. I am so hating my social status right now! What do you expect? Running around talking to animals all the time? I told you a million times: ...I don't talk to them, they keep talking to me! - Maya, watch out! - Oh, no! What are you doing?! What did you do that for, lady? I was gonna pee on that! How bad? Oh, no! You drive like a freaking animal! Are you nuts? You can get people killed like that! Don't tell it to me, tell it to the pig! So I talked to Heather, who text-messaged Mandy... ...who IM'd Christy, who two-way'd with Tammy... ...and the bottom line is we're both invited to the party tonight! Oh, my, God! You're the best! So then I invited them to your party at the end of summer. - You did what? - I didn't want to be rude. Rude? Rude is inviting somebody to a party that doesn't even exist yet! Look, do you want to be in or not? So... Maya. I hear you're having a birthday party this summer... Yes, and it would be so cool if all of you guys came. I mean... I assume you're having it somewhere worthwhile? - I don't really know yet, but... - It's on a boat. Like, on a rowboat? Actually, it's on a huge, P. Diddy-like boat. How MTV of you! We'll think about it. A birthday party. That is so freshman year! They're so coming, I can feel it! You ready? We've got to go. We got to help set up for Senior Day. 20 minutes, people! Hey, dude! You rolling to the jump off tonight? - It's gonna be off the hook. - Hi, Carl. He nodded at me, did you see that? Keep it up, and he might actually talk to you. Nice shot, you freaking moron! Give the bird a break, dude! What's with you and that dumb thing? I just feel bad for him, being locked up in a cage... How do you feel so bad for him? How? The only person who has the combination is Principal Thomas. Aw, jeez, it's 8-15-27! Hey, guys, maybe you should try 8-15-27. Great! The freak that talks to animals. Wait, let me guess: ...the hawk told you the combo? So, what if he did? You don't have to be a jerk about it. Go ahead then, Carl. Let the bird out, I dare you. Alright! Shake a tail feather! Oh, thanks a lot, pal. I'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen, the hawk has left the building! - Sweet. - I owe you one. There is Maya Dolittle! Anybody who is anybody is gonna be there. I even heard Carl call it "the party of the year". Parties? Ooh-la-la! I love parties! I'm sure you do. - Now... - Ooh, it's that kind of party! - Tell me where it hurts. - Okay, I'm ready. So is the party in the neighborhood? Cool! Now I can see in color! Oh, yes, definitely. What do you think, Lucky? I was thinking something, you know, furrier. I'm serious. This party is as big as it gets. You look great, kid! We were listening to that! I just got off the phone with your principal... ...and I saw what you did to my car. Smells like trouble... Sounds like you had an interesting afternoon. Yeah, but it wasn't my fault. I was trying to impress Carl, and there was this bird... I was 17 once, too, Maya. I know what you're going through. Really? So animals chattered at you 24-7? No, but I do know what it's like to want to fit in. Good. Then you know why I have to finish getting ready for the party. I'm sorry, sweetie... ...but I think you have earned yourself a night in. But I thought you understood! I've been working on this look for hours! Any longer, I would've peed on the bed. It's just one night. But why does it have to be tonight? "Where's Maya?", "Oh, she's at home, grounded!" I might as well tell everybody you put me in a time-out. I'm sure there'll be other parties. Lucky, I need a favor. Give me a bone and a belly rub, and I'm your man. Look, we were lucky even to get invited, right? So I think the best approach in a case like this is just... ...to keep a low profile. - Definitely, low pro all the way. Let's get this party started, people! Sorry. I guess I got a little carried away. We'll be lucky if anybody even talks to us after that! Speak for yourself, girlfriend! I just wanted to say thanks for taking the rap for me earlier. Please, it was... totally my pleasure. Cool. So you wanna dance? Come on! Charisse is fine, but I'm getting really worried about Maya, John. I know you had trouble at first, but you were a grown man. Maya's a 17-year-old girl trying to figure life out. You know what? I think I might have an idea. I'm gonna talk to her about it right now. Maya, come down! Hey, Maya, if you won't sing, at least come down and dance. Viv! Low pro, remember? Oh, forget that! You're the best dancer here. Step up, girl! Come on, Maya, let's go! What a doofus, and it's her wig! Hey, girl! - Is that Carl and Maya Dolittle? - Sure, he is. What are you doing with her? Girl, I'm grooving! He must be out of his mind! Hey, Justin, turn around, check her out! That dance is sick! These moves are tight! She's pretty good! I told you, girl! Dr. Maya! My butt is ready to rock and roll! Let's get this party started, people! Bombs away! - What the? - Fire in the hole! - Look out below! - Is it hailing? - I'm so bad! Oh, no! What is he doing here? I'm popping, I'm locking, I'm popping, I'm locking. Go away! Get out of here! Shoo! It's time to get my freak on. Why are you doing this to me? You'll ruin everything. Leave me alone! What? We were just following you. Here I come. Monkey on the move! Time to meet some ladies! This way to the bar, girls! It's ladies night! Is that what I think it is? Check it out! It's imported from France. - You spiked the punch? - Don't worry, it's good stuff. - Wait! Is Maya talking to it? - Oh, no. - Who brought her anyway? Has anyone seen my CD? Au revoir, party poopers! Come on, Carl, let's dance. Look, just leave now, and I won't tell... Oh, no, where'd you go? #Allons, enfants de la patrie, le jour de gloire est arriv! # The monkey gave it to you... You really expect me to believe that? The monkey from dad's clinic followed me to the party, and... Oh, the party that you snuck out to attend? Well, yeah, but it wasn't my fault! - Then whose fault is it? - This ought to be good. I told you, it was the monkey's. Oh, the monkey, the hawk, the dog! The dog? I wasn't even there! The dog... God, do you ever shut up? Don't hate the player, girl, hate the game! You see, that's the problem: ...I'm always talking to animals, Mom. I need them to stop. No, you need to stop. I think maybe you need to start thinking seriously... ...about who you really are... ...and what your future has in store for you. Okay, well... I guess I can take a couple of weeks off from the clinic... ...just to get my head together. Maybe go down to the beach, and do some shopping with Viv. The beach? I could use a tan. I'm talking about a complete break... ...a total change of scenery. There's this camp, a ranch, actually... ...that I went to when I was younger. - Wait! A ranch? Yeah, that's a good one, Mom... ...but you and I both know I'm not a ranch kind of girl. I think this could be a really good thing for you. Mom, you were not me! Oh, God, Mom! You're sending me away? To a ranch, with animals? What are you thinking? Maya, you love animals. Okay, Mom, just listen to me for one second. I was almost "B" crowd once... ...then I start talking to animals, and I went straight to a "C". Now I'd just be happy being back to "B" minus... ...like the swim team people. - Or the chess club even. I'm sorry, sweetie, I'm trying to help you. But you're punishing me for something I can't control. I'm not punishing you. You have a gift, and you need to learn to accept it. I'd rather return it. I want to talk to daddy. I already did. He thinks it's a great idea. Well, you'd better get some sleep, because the bus leaves at noon. - Wait, I'm leaving tomorrow? - Durango is a great place. You're going to thank me one day. No, I won't! Mom, I just want to be normal! I wish I wasn't a Dolittle... Mom, I'm serious! I'm not going! A ranch? What would I even wear? Oh, my God, my hair! I think I just went straight from a "C" to an "F". "F" is good. "F" is the new "B". Mom, I can't believe I let you talk me into this! Just give it a chance, honey. I promise, one day... Yes, I know, one day I'll thank you. Just do your best to have a good time... ...and everything is going to work itself out. Go. - I don't know if I can do this. - Sure you can! Just do what I do. And what is that? Drink out of the toilet bowl? No, I take it one day at a time. Yeah, thanks for the advice, Dr. Phil! - Stay off my bed while I'm gone. - Oh, you can count on me. Not... Not... What happened? You miss the bus to the mall? Yeah, but that was only because I was trying to figure out... ...how much make-up we were going to need for your makeover. Okay, it's going to be like that, huh? Hey, you're the one messing with me? Ladies, ladies! Come on, now. Calm down! Papa's here, alright? We don't need to argue, where's love? Sorry, dude. Didn't mean to do that. - It's a big bag, isn't it? - Yeah... it's not the only thing! Coming through. Excuse me, these are big bags. Watch out. Oh, come on! - Anybody wants some Off? - Some back off is more like it. - What? It's good to be prepared. - Prepared for what? Malaria? Come on, I've got donuts here. D- nut? D-nut? Want a donut? D-nut? Ah, cool. - How about you? You want one? - No. Whoopsie daisy. Five second rule's still in effect. This is gonna be one long summer... What's the matter? You homesick already? What's your problem? You don't even know me! No, and I don't need to know you either, okay? - I can spot your type a mile away. - Hey, hey! Let's play the quiet game, huh? Winner gets a date with yours truly? Shouldn't you be, like, at fat camp or something? Look, my bones are large. Alright? Whatever helps you sleep at night! Wow, this is gorgeous! That's Silver Spurs, another ranch. Your ranch is over there. Oh, no! Yeah! Finally we're here! Excuses-moi! Something stinks! Okay, clearly, there's been a mistake. I said "A list" not "hay list". Hello? Mom, are you there? - Mom, are you there? Pick up! - Maya! Come on, pick up, it's me! Maya, I'm coming. Just hang on, just keep yapping. It's awful out here... Call me whenever you get this message. - I need you to come pick me up. - Maya, Maya! Where's that freaking button? - I really need to learn how to read! - Okay, bye... I've got to get out of here. - Easy! - You princess, what are you looking at over there? On second thought, maybe this place isn't so bad after all. That's the only smart thing you've said all day. Who are you?! I'll be back to you later. - The crapper... - Oh, I just stepped on something! Howdy! Welcome to Durango. I'm Bo. Wow, Bo! That was amazing what you did with that horse! Do you, like, work here or something? I guess you can say that. My dad owns this place. Cool! The first thing is get you guys unpacked, and you can go ahead and... You have amazing eyes! Thank you, that's... mighty kind of you to say that. Oh, no, please tell me I didn't just say that out loud! Don't worry. I won't even hold it against you. By the way, I didn't catch your name. I'm Brooklyn. Brooklyn Webster. Okay, Brooklyn Webster. How you doing? I'm... doing much better now! I'm Maya. Maya Do... Dolores. Maya Dolores Hanes. Maya Dolores Hanes... That's an interesting name right there. Not really. Just your simple, Plain Jane kind of last name. Nothing really special about it. I really like those chaps on you. Those look... fantastic! And I love your hat. It makes us look like we're twins! They're like moths to a flame! You know, it's very nice to meet both of you ladies. It's nice to meet all of you, guys. The first thing we need to do is get everybody unpacked... ...and get you guys all settled in, alright? - Okay. Come on, everybody... ...I'm going to show you all to the bunkhouse... ...and then we can all get started on some ranching chores. - Swell! I want the bed with the window! Oh, what a dump! Were you expecting the Four Seasons, or something? Okay, did I do something specific or are you always such a... Oh, I'm sorry, did I hurt your little Miss Priss feelings? No, seriously, do you always act like this? Only when I see something I want. And right now, I want Bo. So you need to back off, okay? Thank you! Hey, Jud. I got those animals loaded up and ready to go. Okay, Walt. I sure appreciate you taking that livestock off my hands. That's what neighbors are for. Despite always whipping your butt at the rodeo... ...the Silver Spurs has always considered the Durango an old friend. Now, if there's anything else I can do... ...you just let me know. I've always got my eyes open for some good land. I'm sure you do. Well, Walt, if you'll excuse me... ...I got some new recruits up there waiting on me. - You take care, Jud. - You do the same, Walter. Goatsies, goatsies! What are you looking at, fat boy? Silly pigs. Why, you want a piece of me, pork chop? Do I look funny to you, huh? What? I got a boog? I get it? Gone? You hungry? Hey, where you going? I ain't finished with you! I'll see you at the buffet table! Hey, gang, I'm Jud Jones. Welcome to Durango. I imagine most of you already met my son Bo, here. We're going to be working hard here at Durango for the next six weeks... ...getting you all ready to ride in the local rodeo... ...and anyone that trains hard enough... ...can take a shot at the individual competition... ...and who knows? You might get to win a nice, big shiny trophy. - Wouldn't it be easier if we just watched it on TV? - Shut up! So we're not going to be competing as a team? No, son. I'm afraid that the Durango ranch... ...doesn't enter into the team portion of the competition. How come? Let's say it's hard to expect a bunch of city folk... ...to compete against experienced cowboys. - But who's ready to become a cowboy in training? - Me! And they call me weird! Are you going to teach the bull ride? That's the coolest. Come on, gang! The best cowboy is no match for the right bull on a bad day. But... you don't expect us to do that other stuff, right? Oh, no, not today. Today, you're going to take yourself a nice leisurely trail ride. And tomorrow? - Tomorrow, little lady, the real work begins. - Can't wait. Okay, Red. Let's see what you got. Okay, I can do this. Man, Tyler, you are a wuss! Here, let me show you, guys, how it's done, okay? Watch this. Let me show you how it's done. You could use a bath around here! Watch this, guys. One at a time! Why do I always get the fat kid? Shouldn't have had that third Snickers. Don't worry, kid. She'll move when the time's right. Well, looks like you're up, Maya! What's the matter, princess? You scared you might break a nail? No. I've just never done something like this before. - I think I'll try it later. - Never is more like it. And the princess goes down! - Are you okay? - Yeah. You've got to get on her from this side. Don't worry, she's pretty old. She doesn't move like she used to. Old? I got you old, buddy! - No, no, no! Wait! - Oh, no, no. - No, no! Oh, my God! - Move, Bo! - Help! Come on, son, move! I thought I was off to a bad start. Come on! Whatever's your name, stop it! Stop it, slow down. - Who's the old one now, huh? - Help me! Hang on, Maya! Hold back on the race! You alright? That's good. Let's see if we can get you on this thing the right way! There you go. See, there? Natural born rider. Any day, Dolores. Hey, Bo, thanks... ...and maybe later you can show me how to do all this on my own. "Maybe next time you can show me how to do it on my own. " You don't actually think that crap's going to work, do you? I'm sorry, I believe the phrase is, "Don't hate the player, hate the game". Game on! You got served! Goodbye! If you think I'm dirty, you should see my pen! - Hey, I sleep on my own crap! - You shut up! - Have you seen Cogburn lately? - No, you shut up! He's not the head of the hen house. Hey, pig, what are you doing? Alright, I got one, check this out. What do you call three cows sitting in a jacuzzi? Stew! Do you animals ever stop? What is your problem? Was I talking in my sleep again? I tend to do that. Sorry. - You are such a weirdo. - 27, 28, 29... Shut up! Hey, what comes after 29? I knew. Oh, I don't even know why I bother. Hey, just wake up if you want! What do I care? What a joke! When is Jud going to realize we girls have our needs? Would it kill the man to get a rooster with a little chutzpah? Cock-a-doodle-do! Sleeping Ugly! Oh, no! You okay? I guess you weren't kidding about bright and early, huh? Dad likes to get a head start on the sun. So I'd say you got about 10 minutes till we get going. Okay. Alright. So anyways... ...I finally realized hitchhiking is impossible without a thumb! So I hopped on the back of a pickup truck, and here I am. - Oh, no. No way! It can't be! - You all be good now, you hear? Hey, Maya! Look who's gone country! Hey, there, little fellow! Aren't you the cutest little thing? What's with the baby talk, Maya? I can hear you, remember? Which is why you need to get out of here. Now, go on, scram! But I heard your message. I came here to rescue you. I'm serious. You cannot stay here! If the kids find out I'm a Dolittle, I'm... But you are a Dolittle, aren't you? Of course I'm a Dolittle. Only right now, I'm a Dolittle who's fitting in. If the animals find out I can talk to them, I'm doomed! Why? You love animals. Of course I love animals. It's just that if they talk to me, I'm going to talk back... ...and if I talk back, the kids will think I'm some kind of freak. You can stay here if you want... ...but just find something to occupy your time. - Occupy my time! Copy that. - Okay. This doesn't have anything to do with the cowboy behind you, does it? You mean the really cute one? He's... behind me? Hey! Are you talking to that stray dog? They like it for you to talk to them like they're people... ...because it makes them feel important. - Yeah... - So let me get this straight. I come all the way here and now you're just going to ignore me? But I wore a wig! Do you have any idea how confusing that can be to a dog's identity? Go round them up, get them together. Alright, Durangos! Let's go, everybody! - Durangos! Let's go! On the double! - Let's go! On the double! Round up! Round up! Okay, yesterday you all got your feet wet. Today you're going swimming. There's a pool? Sweet! It's a metaphor, you moron! Well, like I was saying... ...it's time to find out what you kids are made of. So Bo and the boys have built a couple of contraptions... ...to simulate what an actual rodeo might be like. So remember: Have fun out there! - You got 'em, son. - Alright, Pops. - Let's just head on over this way. - Cool. Nice shorts, Clayton! What, I'm a lover, not a fighter! Let's go. Nice little brisk run here, come on! Left, left, left, right, left... Who's the one talking smack now? Huh, fat boy? Come on! Nay! Come on! You don't really think you can catch me, do you? So close, yet so fat. Left, left, left, right, left. Oh! Left, left, left, right, left. Left, left, left, right... Poop it out! Come on, poop it out! - Hey! - Poop it! - That's a rooster! I'd wash your hands. - Alright, let's grub! - Finally something I'm good at! Maya! Maya, over here! It's important. Please! It's better be good. Well, you see, the thing is this... I... Oh, no, I know that face. What did you do? I... may or may not have slipped up... ...and told one or two of the animals who you were. What? Thanks for selling me up the river! Hey, take it easy! I didn't know what else to say... ...when they asked me what I was doing here. It's fine. Wait! You're sure it was just one or two, right? Yeah, pretty sure... And then again it could have been... ...all of them. I think that's her. You are so dead when we go home! Hey, whatever the man's best friend thinks, huh? Humans... - Morning, Miss Dolittle! - Hey! Oh! I don't want to ruffle any feathers, Miss Dolittle, but I've got a problem. I knew this was gonna happen. Hey, Maya! Excuse me, girl... ...there's something I need to talk to you about. - Something really important. - Gracie, whatever it is... ...I'm sure you can work it out on your own. But if you don't mind, I rather be left alone, okay? Hello, hello! Okey-dokey! Lob one? Hey, slow down there, sexy! Around here, that egg is considered a collector's item! - Look who it is. - Hey, ladies, what's cracking? The little rooster who couldn't. Seriously, like low egg production is my fault. You're not helping anything by mocking me, you know? Talk about a cock-a-doodle-don't! That's very funny! - Hey, watch it! - You watch it, lady! I had a really bad day so far, alright? But if you wanna dance, let's dance! Hey! What is wrong with you? "Oh, be a rooster!", they say. "Show us what you're made of", they say. They think it's easy being the only rooster... ...on a farm full of hens? Well, it's not! I'm sorry, look... I'm just under a lot of pressure. I just wish there was someone I could talk to... I'm sure everything's going to be okay. Hey, you just talked to me! You mean none of the other animals talk to you? Well, I've been in kind of a funk lately. I haven't been out of the coop in days. Well, just give it a little bit of time. I'm sure everything will work out. Hey, people fight. People fight! Don't just stand there! Help us! Give me a ten-spot on the tough one. - Hey! - What? Just playing the odds. Disgusting! Go ahead! Pick on the skinny guy! What has gotten into you, kids? I was planning to sell those eggs this afternoon! Come on, Pops! They're just having a little fun. It's like that, huh? Alright, then. So... ...what do you women want exactly? I mean, a guy can do so much... - Sorry, Cogburn, but talking to you earlier almost got me busted. - But... Now, leave me alone before somebody sees. But what good is talking to animals... ...if you can't help a brother out?! Hey, come back! Hey, still ignoring me? What do you think? Sheesh! I never knew you were such a snob! A snob? What? I am so not a snob! I'm just doing my best to try to fit in, that's all. Plus, I really think Bo is starting to like me. He likes you? Who you're pretending to be? Can't you see that just for once I want to be normal? But you're not normal, Maya. You're a Dolittle. Yeah, not out here, I'm not. I just hate not talking to you. You're my best friend. I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be taking any of this out on you. I know you're just trying to help. About time you gave the dog his due! And I guess it's okay if all the animals know... ...but we have to make sure no people find out. - You think I'm going to tell them? - If you could, yeah! Wait! Where have you been all morning? You know, just different things... I love it here... The wide open spaces, and the straw... Yeah, you met the collie, haven't you? Yeah... she is smoking! Come on! Oh, forget it, Bo! You can't break him. Besides, we need the money. Wait, you're gonna sell him? Why? Pretty as he is, he ain't no use to us if he won't let nobody ride him. What's his name? - He doesn't have one. - Maybe you should name him. I wouldn't even know where to begin. The name's Butch. You must be Maya. How about Butch? Why Butch? My mama gave me that name. You got a problem with that, cowboy? I don't know. Maybe he just... looks like a Butch to me. Alright. Then Butch it is. You think you could do something for me? I got this rock in my shoe. It's been driving me nuts all day. I'd love to. Let's see. Come on! Up, Butch! Ah! Thanks, kid. I guess I owe you one. No problem! But why won't you just let them break you? I'm a stallion, sweetheart... ...and stallions don't break that easy. You know if they can't break you, they're going to sell you. If they're gonna sell me anyway, I might as well go down swinging. What do you mean "if they're gonna sell you anyway"? Look around, kid. Jud's been selling off animals for weeks. The place is starting to look like a ghost town. - That's so sad. - Tell me about it! Hey, Pops. Ain't that the darndest thing? Look at that! The stallion actually let her touch him. You went off to college for a year and you still haven't figured out... ...that there's more to a woman than just a pretty smile? - Still learning, Pops. - Every day, son! That's pretty impressive the way you got on with Butch. - You have a lot of pets at home? - Me? No! What would make you think that? I mean, I love them and everything... ...if that's what you're asking, but I wouldn't say I was an expert. So what about you? You seem to be pretty in tune with them yourself. Let's say I understand them a lot more than I understand people. I mean, especially you girls. You never have to guess what an animal is feeling. You know, I think that hay this morning gave me the runs. Unfortunately, I know exactly what you mean. Well... nice talking to you. You too. Look what we've got here! The amazing... ...the wonderful... Durangos! Let's go see these little cats! Take a good look from over there, Durangos. That's as close as you're ever going to get... ...'cause you're not welcome over here. - Like we care, Little Lord Fauntleroy! Watch it, girl! What? You better watch you're mouth... Hey! Look. Knock it off, alright, guys? Just knock it off. Should probably enjoy your summer, though, Bo. Looks like it's going to be your last. - What is that supposed to mean? - Nothing. Nothing at all, man. - Let's just go, you all. - That's right, tuck tail and run! Seems to be the only thing you and your dad are good at teaching. Guess I'll see you later! Come on, boy! Let's get going. - Let's go. - See you later, Durangos! Let's get out of here! Yeah! Cattle drive, sleep outside. Haven't they ever heard of ticks? The word is that the collie's coming. Hey, you know me. I love working the road. That's the spirit gang. See, the more we work together the better we'll be. See, ranching's all about teamwork. Hear that? Maybe us two should buddy up. You're not that lucky. Shucks! I left some of the army blankets in the gear hut. I'll be back. - No. You stay put. I'll go get them. - Thank you. Isn't that helpful of you, Maya? Hey, Jud, that's a safety hazard. Careful! My... This is gonna be one long ride. Yeah. I wonder why he never said anything! Hey, Dad! Something's going on to you. Are you going to tell me or to keep it bottled up as usual? I know I should've told you sooner... ...but the bank's going to foreclose on the place in a couple of weeks... ...if I don't catch up on the payments. We'll figure out how to get the money. We always do. This is the open range, gang. So far we've been teaching you individual skills. To get out here, you all put your skills together in what we call "team work". Hey, Jud! - You really like it out here, huh? - I love it. See, Maya, it's days like this that make me understand... ...why the settlers moved West and risked everything they had. It was their destiny. That's one thing I've come to find out. You can't fight your destiny, Maya. No matter how much you think it might cost you. You can't fight it. Hey, Pops! I went all the way down to the river. You know over there by Silver Spurs? I spotted a herd... ...just down the way up here, about half a mile. Okay. Gang, now listen up! Now me and Bo will do most of the cutting... ...but you kids feel free to jump in any time you want, okay? - Okay. - Go ahead, Bo, lead on. - Awesome! Come along! Durango, let's go! I'm gonna miss this place, too, girl! Come on, buddy! Let's go! Can I take a picture? I want to show it to mom. Hey! If I get you, boy! You're not going to take my candy! Alright, stampede! He got him! Hey, get your own candy! Note to self: Don't steal candy from fat kids. Oh, my God! Relax, now, sweetheart. Nobody else move a muscle. Oh, my God, I'm gonna die! No, you're not! Nobody's gonna die on my watch, baby. Besides, his bark is a lot worse than his bite. What the? Look at Tyler, will you? Will you look at him? Way to go, boy! I did it! You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight? Hey, who killed the lights? I heard they taste like chicken. Thank you. - Lucky, was that a wolf? - Wolf, shmolf. I eat those chumps for breakfast. Care for a midnight stroll? Why don't I get inside here and rescue you? So how do you like it? The whole being-a-cowboy thing? I wouldn't know. I mean... ...I spent the last year as a freshman at Palo Alto. Really? Well, Palo Alto's not that far from San Francisco. I've been thinking the same thing. You see, it's a great night. "Va vest". The best. That's what I meant to say. The best. A cattle drive! More like a cattle marathon. Am I right? There it is! That's the Bekerman place. It's a beautiful spread, isn't it? I never get tired of looking at it. Tell me, Pops! You think they've earned a night on the town? Yeah, I reckon. Don't fall off the horse! - This music's giving me a headache. - Baby, a headache? I thought we were gonna sniff each other. I like this place. It's not my usual crowd but I like it. Oh, yeah? So what's your usual crowd then? This might sound a little corny... ...but I think I'm just now figuring that out. Check it out. Easy, fat boy! Isn't there some kind of weight limit here? You break it, you buy it. You aren't thinking what I think you're thinking. There's a time in every man's life when he has to put his foot down... ...and draw a line in the sand. - Yeah, but does that have to be here? - Yes. - Against them? - Yes. Alright. Light me up! This is gonna be good! Boy down! Look at that! Move out of the way. I'm gonna show you how it's done. Excuse me! Alright, kids. Show what you get. Okay. Why don't I show you losers how a real cowboy does it, alright? Bring it up a few notches, let me show off. Take a look, Durango! Care to take a shot at the title? Or are you still a has-been, Bo? Durangos, we leave in an hour. An hour? Looks like there's trouble in paradise! Alright, don't forget, folks! Stings, huh? #Settle down, Cinderella. Keep it together. # #Your handsome fella will ride up sooner or later. # #Yeah, and take you away, yeah! # #Settle down, Cinderella, love's gonna find you some day. # Cinderella, my butt! More like the evil step-sister! What about a tough act to follow! Give it up for Kiki! Alright! Guys, somebody's got to step up. We can't let them beat us in everything. Hey, don't look at me, alright? I already took my stand. (The freak that talks to animals.) (You need to start thinking about who you really are.) (You can't fight your destiny.) Alright! Now hold your horses, everyone! Looks like we got a last minute addition from Durango! Sure hope she sings better than I ride! - Not the only one. - Hi, everybody. I know you guys heard of hip-hop... ...but this is a little something I like to call "hick-hop". Check it out! #Sometimes my nails match my lips and... # #... my jeans hug my hips. # #I don't feel like doing that right now. Listen! # #He's on his way over. # I hate to admit it, but she's pretty good. #You better love me when my roots are showin'... # #... or I'll pack up my boots, be goin'. # #Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye! Hey! # #If it's me that he's impressed with... # #... anything I might be dressed in... # #... ought to be just fine. # #If he's the one for me, I'll know it. # #He better loves me when my roots are showin'. # #He better loves me when my roots are showin'. # #Or I'll pack up my boots and I'll be goin'. # #If it's me that he's impressed with... # #... anything I'm dressed with... # #... ought to be just fine. # #Ought to be just fine... # #He better loves me when my roots are showin'. # #Or I'll pack up my boots and I'll be goin'. # #Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye! Hey! # #If it's me that he's impressed with... # #... anything I might be dressed in... # #... ought to be just fine. # #If he's the one for me, I'll know it, I will! # #If he's the one for me, I'll know it, I will! # #If he's the one for me, I'll know it! # #Love me when my roots are showin'. # Looks like we got a new champion. Ladies and gentlemen... ...Maya Dolores Hayes! I'm sorry, but you're out of time. You either sell the land and what's left of the land to Silver Spurs... ...or the bank will foreclose and you'll end up with nothing. - Okay, Bo! Bring them all in. - Let's go everybody. Jud, you should have been with us. The ride was great! Oh, that's good! That's really good! There's no easy way to say this, so I'm going ahead and get it over with. Looks like I'm going to have to let the ranch go. - What? - Got to let it go. - You're kidding, right? - I'm afraid not, Brooklyn. I'm sorry. This blows. I don't want to leave. I know. I wish there was something we could do. Let's just get some grub, guys. I can't believe I'm saying this... ...but I'm not even hungry. Excuse me, Maya. Sorry to wake you, but your presence has been requested in the barn. Whatever it is, make it quick. I don't want anyone to see me out here. You're the only one who can help us, Maya. You are our only hope. I don't know what to tell you, guys. I can't stop Jud from selling the ranch. I wish I could, but there's nothing I can do. Maybe the other kids would help if you just tell them who you are. I can't just announce to everybody... ...that the animals asked me to save the ranch. They'll think I'm crazy. Don't you mean "Bo will think you're crazy"? No. Yeah... Look, you guys, I can't lose him. You're not losing anybody. You're a Dolittle. They'll understand. That's the problem, Butch: They won't understand. Other kids never do. - We can't do this without you. You're our voice, Maya. - Sorry. Dolittle? More like "Donothing". Maya, you've got to tell them the truth. Woah, Red. It's getting to be about that time. Even though we weren't able to finish the summer up properly... ...I want everyone of you knows that I believe in everyone of you. And you all might be city folk... ...but you've got a lot of talent, and you've got a lot of heart. That's not too easy to find in folks these days. You all take care! - We'll see you, Red. - Yeah. - We'll see you, Big Fella. - Yeah. - Lay off the burgers here! Thank you so much. I had so much fun. - God bless you. - Thanks. - I'm so sorry, Jud. - Don't you worry, sweetie-pie. We'll be just fine. Drive careful, son. Shotgun. I called it. Man, poor Jud... Did you see the look on his face when we drove off? Yeah. I just wish there was something we could have done. Man, this sucks! You guys are like the coolest friends I've ever had. "Coolest"? Or "only"? - What? - You know what. It's time, Maya. Time for you to be a Dolittle again. I know I'm just a dog, but if they really are your friends... ...and if Bo really cares about you... ...they'll accept you, no matter who you are. But only if you accept yourself first! We need to stop the bus. Why? Because I know how we can save the ranch. This ought to be good. We enter the rodeo this weekend, as a team... ...and win the 50,000 dollar prize. Think about it! Clayton has already proved that he can wrangle a steer... ...and Tyler has become a pro at the rope, now. And Brooklyn can ride circles around anybody. Yeah, but what about the bull ride? Who's gonna do that? I saw all your trophies when I got the blankets in the hood. You were the best bull rider in the whole state. Maya, it's too little too late. Even if I did ride... ...the rodeo's this weekend. We'd never be ready in time. What if I told you we also had a secret weapon... ...something that no other ranch has, not even Silver Spurs. What would that be? Me. No offense, but I didn't see you do anything special except sing. My real name isn't Maya Dolores Hanes. It's Maya Dolittle and... ...I can talk to animals. Right, and I'm the poster boy for Jenny Craig! - I'm serious, Clayton. - I knew you looked familiar. I see your dad on the news all the time. Yes. And I'm sorry I lied to you, guys... ...but I didn't want you to look at me like I was freak or something. The point is all the animals came to me... ...and they really don't wanna be sold. They love Durango as much as we do. And the way I see it, they can tell us what we need to do to win. Do you know what? That might actually work. What the heck? I'm in. If it's going to help Jud out... ...I'm with you, girl. Time to cowboy up, everybody! So what do you think, Bo? Look, I'm sorry I lied to you... ...but it was because I liked you. Out of all the time we spent together, the things we said to one another... ...you wait until now to tell me that you can talk to animals. Back home I was considered a weirdo. That's why my mom sent me here... ...so I could make a fresh start. It may have taken me a little longer than it should have, but... Wait. If you let me finish, there's something I have to ask you. Do you have any idea how cool that is? Look, I'll understand if you... Wait! What did you say? I said that's about the coolest thing that I've ever heard. I've practically spent my whole life wishing that I could talk to animals... ...and you can! I hate to say I told you so. So wait! You're not mad? Mad? No! Sweetie, come here. Now why would I be mad? Other than the fact that I have to ride... ...a 2000 pound animal that wants to kill me... I mean, no, I'm not. I'm cool. - Come on, we've got a meeting that we've got to interrupt. - Cool. All I need is a signature, Jud. Here you go, Jud! You can keep it, if you like, as a souvenir. Dad, wait! Don't sign anything! Hold on, tiger. Your daddy's just about to finish some business. No, you hold your horses, Walter. Sounds like my son needs to speak to me. What's going on? What you all two doing here? What brings you all over here? Speak up! I'm not who you think I am, Jud. I know just who you are, Miss Dolittle. What? You mean you knew it all this time? Why didn't you say anything? I figured you'd tell us when you got good and ready. Well, I'm ready now. We all want to enter the rodeo as a team and win the prize money. I can get all the animals to co-operate... ...if, of course, you don't sell them, and you... promise to let them stay. Who are we going to get to ride a bull for 8 second? Tell me that? Nope. No, that is not going to happen. We've been over this a hundred times before, Bo. The doctor said if you take one more fall like you did last time... ...you might never walk again. No, sir. No. Not going to happen. I'm not willing to take that risk. - But I am, okay? - Bo! It's my life and it's my choice. And I've made it, okay? I'm not letting them take the ranch from us! Pops. I'm gonna get on that bull... ...and I am not coming off until that bell rings. I see the gang's all here. We can do this, Jud. Together. As a team. Just like you taught us at the cattle drive. What the hey! At the very least, it'll put Walter's shorts in a bunch. Oh, yes! Gentlemen, it seems there's been a change of plans. I'll see you at the rodeo. - Looks like I got myself a team. - But, Jud, I mean... I know my way out. Move it, Brooklyn! The only thing is gonna hurt you is the ground! - 29 seconds. - Is that good? The winning time is 13. Wait here a second. I got an idea. Remember you said you owed me one? I'm taking you up on that offer! What do you mean? You're the biggest and strongest horse out here. If we have any shot of winning the rodeo... ...we need to let Brooklyn and Tyler ride you in their events. Me? An untamed stallion in a real rodeo? I would be honored! Lord, I hope that's mud! Hey, beefcake! When you got to go, you got to go! What's he saying? He's just giving a little constructive criticism... ...but he says you're doing great. Like that. Can you try? I think you should walk like a man. Well, a lot of good that does me. I'm a rooster, remember? Come on, you can do it! Got it! Come on, puff that chest out! Put your shoulders back! See, you know what I'm talking about! He says: "Ease up on the reins and stake back on the saddle!". Until he wants to throw, then he should shift his weight forward. Until you want to throw, then shift your weight forward! - Tell him to speed up! - The cow wants you to speed up! Forget that! Tell the stupid calf to slow down! On a personal note, I would think twice before calling a calf stupid. Can't argue with you there. Left, left, left, right, left. #I don't care if you think it's true. # #You'll be cowboys when you're through! # #We don't care if you think it's true. # #We'll be cowboys when we're through! # #I don't care where you've been. Durango Ranch is going to win! # #We don't care where you've been. Durango Ranch is going to win! # Like this? Now you know what I'm talking about! Let's go! Okay, I'm feeling you. Thanks, girlfriend! That's great! That's it! Get you some of that! - I could ride that thing. - Yeah, if it's not moving. So are you nervous? A little, I guess. Why? Are you? Well... I just don't want anybody to get hurt out there. Don't worry about it too much. I mean those guys should be fine. Yeah, well, it's not them that I'm worried about. Looks like she's about to slip him the old tonguerooski. No, I wasn't! Please, I may be from right here in the good old USA, but... ...I have been to France plenty of times! You are one sick puppy, do you know that? Rise and shine, Durangos, it's winning time! Good morning and welcome to the Silver Spurs annual rodeo! Today, ladies and gentlemen, we'll have 5 teams... ...competing in 2 rounds of rodeo competitions! Good luck, tippers! - First up, the long horn roping event! - Come on! Untie that little doggie! Oh, looks like it's gonna be close! Hey, not so tight! I bruise easy! - Go, boy! - Yes! Yes! Yes! Next up, it's the big man's event: Steer wrestling! I'm going to own you, big boy! I'll have you know you're looking at a three-time state wrestling champ. I'll have you know I once shoved a whole box of Twinkies in my mouth... ...without swallowing them. First up, Chip Woodman! And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the new record: 5.4 seconds! Good luck! Go back. You missed the steer man! I don't know if we should give that young man a hand or a cane! It's time for some barrel racing! Come on! Come on, boy! Coming in with a time of 16 seconds, the Silver Spurs! - Beat that! - With pleasure! Listen, Brooklyn, I know you're not that crazy about me... ...and you think I'm some kind of spoiled brat or something... ...but I think the way you ride is amazing. Thank you. Now get out there and kicks some butt, would you? Come on, let's go! Come on, Brooklyn! You can do it! Go! Go! - Bring it in! - Come on! 13 seconds! What a great time! Looks like they've got a leaner. - Oh, dang it! - What a bad break for the Durangos! I shouldn't have cut it that close! It's okay. You did great! Despite the Silver Spurs is having a slight lead... ...the championship is still wide open... ...as we move into the second to last event before everybody's favorite... ...the bull ride! - Come on! Durangos, everybody huddle up! Come on, now! Look, we can still win this... ...if we go into the bull ride and be the second or third place. - But we're in last right now. - Yeah. We're only 20 points away from being in second. If we win every event from here on, the money is ours. Come on now, put it in together! Everybody! Durango on three! One, two, three. Durango! Hey, guys! I just wanted to give you a little heads up. I heard the Silver Spurs are planning on having veal to celebrate. - What's veal? - You are, man. Forget that! I'm nobody's main course, pal! One down, two to go. - Hey! - Hey! You talk to the steer? No, but I have a plan. I want you to close your eyes. Yeah, alright. And I want you to picture donuts. But not just any donuts. Glazed donuts. And not just any glazed donuts. Fresh, hot out of the oven glazed donuts. - Now you are speaking my language. - And most importantly... ...I want you to picture those hot glazed donuts... ...on the horns of this steer. Okay, let me at him! Come here, donuts! I'll catch you! Ladies and gentlemen, looks like we have a new record! 3.4 seconds! Let's give it up for Clayton Taylor! Note to self: Definitely do not steal their donuts either. Looks like it's time for some barrel racing! Give our teams a round of applause... ...as they enter the ring in order of the standings. Come on! Hey, what's the matter? It's my hand. I think I busted it up. Okay, just let me take a look at it. Just be really careful because it really hurts. Ow, Maya, God! That really hurts! - Can she ride? - No. It's definitely broken. It's okay, guys. It's over, though. I'm sorry. No, it's not. Not yet, anyway. - Maya, what are you doing? - Yeah, what are you doing? - Welcome aboard. - Thanks. What does it look like I'm doing? You haven't even trained for this event! You said the hardest part of barrel racing is the ground... ...so I just won't hit it. Alright. I'll go tell them we have another rider. Just hold on tight and I'll take care of the rest. Sounds like a plan. Come on, let's go. Pay attention, and don't fall off, or you'll be dead. What? You're just joking, right? Ladies and gentlemen, Brooklyn Webster has a broken hand... - Mom?! - Maya! You don't have to do this, you know. Yes, I do. If it was me, you would have done the same thing. I've got to apologize for being such a jerk to you all summer. I'm not good at getting along with people when I'm jealous of them. I want you to go out there. I want you to make us proud. I got you. The time to beat is 16 seconds. You were just kidding about the whole "die" thing, right? Hello? Oh, no! Come on, let's go! Come on, Butch! Okay, make it happen! You can do this! 15.8 seconds for Maya Dolittle! Oh my! What a comeback for the Durangos! With that win they move into second place in the overall standing... ...with just one event to go. That's right, folks, it's time for the bull ride! - Relax, son. - Yeah, tell that to him. Don't worry, I will. No. Maya, look. This is something that I need to do on my own. Okay? Ride him! 6 seconds, folks. Not bad! And now the highly anticipated comeback ride of Bo Jones! This is for the whole enchilada, folks! Talk about pressure! Prepare to meet your maker. Are you sure you don't want me to talk to him? Why? Did he say something? Nothing you wanna hear. I'm not gonna lie to you again. He said: "Prepare to meet your maker", but he said it in a nice way. Great! I feel better now! Stay on! Yeah! Stay on! Bo! Get up, son! Get up, Bo! Hey, guys, he's gone! Get up, son! - Bo! Wake up, Bo! Come on, son. - Is he alright? Wake up, son! It's official, folks: Bo Jones managed to stay on for the full 8 seconds! You hear that, Bo? Son? Not bad for a has-been, huh? That means the winner of the 50,000 dollar first prize is Jud Jones! I want to see a replay. Boy, it just wouldn't be our style to go out any other way, would it? I want to hear it on three! Durango on three! One, two, three. Durango! Ladies, I'll be back in a second. I'm just going to step out for some fresh air. I've still got it... - So, Bo... - Yes! - Where are we going? It wouldn't be a surprise if I told you where we were going. I just wanted to thank you properly for helping us save the ranch. You're welcome. One second, sweetie... Thank you. Wait... You're welcome. Did I ever tell you I've got a lot of other things to thank you for? Come on! Wait! Where is everybody anyway? Surprise! Oh, my God! It's my birthday party. I completely forgot! Okay, who are you and what have you done with Maya? - Happy birthday, girl! - Oh, thank you so much. - Happy birthday! - Thank you. - Happy birthday! - Thank you! - Oh, Mommy! Thank you so much! - Happy birthday! I didn't do it all myself. I had a little help from your friends. Oh my gosh, this is way better than any boat! - I know, right! - I missed you! As soon as you two are done shrieking, some folks would like a word with you. Wait, I'll be right back. - You know you look the same as you did when you were 16? - Thanks! And thanks for taking care of my little girl. It's kind of funny: She's the one that's been taking care of us. Hey! Maya, for what you did, this is our way of saying thanks. We'd have gotten you a gift but we're broke! I should be thanking you, guys! We couldn't have done it without you! Nah, come on. Go on. Enjoy your party. You deserve it! - Alright. I'll see you guys later. - Bye, Maya. Hey, Maya, thanks for helping me find my Mojo! Tell me something I don't know! And so our story ends. Not really. You see, Bo is up to see Maya every weekend from Stanford. Brooklyn and Maya talk every day. Go figure, huh? Tyler's coming back to Durango next year to teach roping. And Clayton... lost his baby fat... ...and he's now considered quite the catch with the ladies. But the important thing is that Maya's doing great... ...happy to be exactly who she is: A Dolittle. As for me, I'm still the old dog I've always been. Only now I've got a country gal... ...who I like to visit when the city babes get me down. City babes? You and me are going to have talk, Lucky Dolittle. Women... Can't live with them, can't live without them!
