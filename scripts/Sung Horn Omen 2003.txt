Don`t tease him. Or he`ll never use the lift again. And you`ll have to walk the stairs with him. But l think she`s really strange. Ma`am, l`d like to ask you about your warning.

Right, Dan? Right. How is he? You`re his relative? Yes. The boy has internal bruises. He broke his rightarm... ...but it`s been operated. So, he`s better, right? l`m not worried about the bone. But his brain is damaged. l `ll have to examine it again thoroughly. Excuse me. He was just the size of a cat when the car hit him. Nobody helped him. Poor thing. Really, there might have been a camera hidden somewhere. They`ll give you some award soon. l hope so. l`ll resign and help people all day And l don`t have to sit and fight with you guys. Damn you! You start blaming us again. Go find new friends, then. l guarantee. No one can be your friend more than a month. l agree. See? You mess with me. You deserve it. You die! Die! Hey big! Come look! Hey! Breathe! Throw up. Hit his back. Beam! Get some water! Hey! Drink this. Breathe. O.K. Shit! l thought you were kidding. l don`t understand. Why can`t you tell me... ...how you know what`s going to happen to me. lf you don`t feel comfortable talking to me. l`m sorry to disturb you. You don`t understand. She`s in here.

Why do you want to know where l am? lt`s urgent. Or why would l want to talk to you. O.K. Are you with Orm now? What did you say? Could l talk to her? Don`t you understand? l got to go. Your boss called? No. Truthfully, Orm, do you know Dan before? What are you talking about? Nothing. Sorry l`m in a bad mood today. l wasn`t going to cross. Who would know? Little boy. Doyou here me? l gave you the toycars. What`s Orm gotto do with the old lady. l`m all confused. What`s all this about? Beam must have misunderstood by now. Let me call him. You wouldn`t get through. He turned it off since l said... l wanted to talk to Orm. So, you`ll let things happen like she said? O.K. Let`s go and ask her what it`s all about. lf she want's to talk, she`ll talk. lf not. No matter how much you ask her she won`t talk. Or l would know it by now... and l don`t have to be so stressed like this. Orm will open her coffeeshop tomorrow. Let`s ask her. ln front of Beam. So we know what it`s all about. And the picture. How did she get it. lf it was really Orm. Orm must have the answer. l wish the lady in the picture only happened to look like Orm. Please. Don`t let it be her. Beam. You don`t have to be that fast. l don`t want Orm to wait. You have to wait anyway. We have to go to Orm`s shop together. l think you don`t have to go. l`ll go alone. Just a little while Or you might have a problem with Neng again. Go to Orm`s place some other time then. But l want to talk to her. What have you got to say to Orm. You said it once yesterday. When we see her l`ll tell you. What about, Dan? Say it. What`s with you and Orm. Hey Beam! lt wasn`t like that. So. How then? Tell me. O.K. You don`t want us togo. We`re not going. And stop shouting. You two have secrets. lf l tell you, will you believe me? Don`t go. Believe me. Beam is like that. There`s only trouble if you go in. What if something happens to Orm like the old lady said. l`m just bored of you two fighting. lf something really happens, ...do you think we can do anything? She said you would get stuck in the lift. And you would choke on your food. Could you avoid it? l don`t feel good talking about it. We don`t know if it`strue or not, But what l know is that now we`re fighting each other like dogs So, still want to go down? We`d better go to the lady`s house. Check please. You said check? Yes. Why is it so noisy here. How much? What`s up? The customer said it`s noisy. What? They said it`s noisy here. l`ll go and tell them to stop. Forget it. See if l can`t sell it today. At least, l have to see that picture with my own eyes. Here it is. Hey! Big! This is Beam. Ma`am! How come my friend`s photo is with you. Please tell me. Nobody came back. Please tell me. My friend`s photo. How come you`ve got it. Who goes where, does what? Who died. Please tell me. Calm down Big! See how she talks. So confusing, who would understand. Here, Ma`am, listen to me.

How much? ls this really happening? l don`t believe it. l don`t know. But l got to see beam right now. Don`t worry. They won`t do it everyday, Tomorrow they`ll stop. But l couldn`t get through. Try my phone. You don`t want to answer it? Hello! Beam, are you at Orm`s place? Yes. Why? l`m going to see you there. Yeah l`m here. Hey l can`t really hearyou. Can you hear me? Come. Let me talk. Hello! Beam! Don`t go anywhere. l`ll go see you now. Hey! Hello. l can`t hear you. Bye. Why can`t you stop it just for a day? You`re disturbing other people? Where`s Orm? lt seems like she`s just left. What about the man? They went out to get her. Are you deaf? l told you to stop! Beam! Enough! Beam! Do you know that the coffee shop can`t sell. lt`s so noisy. Can you hear me? Beam! Stop! Beam! ls it bad? How could the old lady`s words come true? He wouldn`t tell what he knew. lt happened because of whom? The old lady? Who? Don`t ask now please. What`s this all about? Who is this lady? What has she got to do with this? And if what you two said was true. Did she tell you how to fix it? And will Beam die? Stop. Let`s go. Today l`ll make her say it. Ma`am, why didn`t you tell us Beam would die? He`s dead, you know? Big! Calm down. Ma`am! Come out Ma`am! Where do you normally find her? l always find her right here. So where is she now. Calm down, Big. Ma`am! Why? How come it`s here. Beam just took this photo of me this afternoon. Orm! There`s got to be something else. Hey Big! lt`s her stuff. This belongs to that boy. Have you ever seen it? How did you get this car. When you were little, did you sell the garlands? Did a car hit you? But you met a boy, didn`t you? She`s got nothing to do with it. What the hell is happening? l don`t know. l only know that l got an operation. Excuse me. Where is the boy who was here? l`m looking for her as well. Oh! Butt his is a girl not a boy. The one who was hit by a car? Right! A girl... ...but l don`t know where she is. Follow me. l know. Orm. Go look after Beam. We`ll be back soon. You and l will go back again. Why? Why do you want to go back? l don`t know. But l have to go back. Hey, wait. What is it? l`ll look for her. Sorry. You saved my life again. This girl? Yes, this is the girl that l told you about. l know who l am now. At that time. l survived because you all took care of me. When l was fine. You were all very happy. You were all so good to me. l don`t have to go here and there anymore. Help! Anybody there. Anybody. l really want to be with you. l was really scared that day. Little one! Little one! Where are you? Little one! Come eat. Hungry? Don`t call her. She`s gone. You all got into a fight because you thought l ran away. And l didn`t love you anymore. l wanted to go home. But l was lost. l tried but.. ..it`s too late. l`m sorry. l missed you all. l swore l would look for you no matter which life. But when l`m here, he... He was really hurt. Go back to him. l already know what l have to do. Excuse me. Make way please. Beam. What`s this all about? You must be all right. You wouldn`t be like they say. You must come back. You must be all right. l hope we`ll meet again.
