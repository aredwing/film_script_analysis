You would reign all alone like a queen on a throne if i had my way i haven't made one of these since the 4th of july. I was making one when the quake hit frisco. Believe me, friend, i wouldn't go to all this trouble for any of these foreigners. Oop, oop, you got to wait a minute and let the oil sink in. There you are, partner. You can tell your grandchildren about that one. Say, what in the name of - why, i'm so sorry. I'm so glad. Such a beautiful drink, too. Yes, paradise cocktail. Seem to be a few drops left. Always the most precious, the last few drops. That's luck. Yes. My name is dan. Mine's joan. Hello, joan. Hello, dan. May we, uh, drink to our meeting? We should. Here's... here's hail and farewell. Well, that seems a bit ruthless. Let's say - - auf wiedersehen. - Auf wiedersehen. Auf wiedersehen. Auf wiedersehen. And so. Please, shall i introduce you to my friends? I think not. Luck has allowed us a few drops of a paradise cocktail. Another would have destroyed the charm. You're right. Let's trust luck will come again. Known him long? Ever so long. Where? I... i can't quite remember. Better skip a few cocktails, darling. Come on, everybody, how about a little drink to joan? Joan, we're drinking to you. To joan. Cheers! It's been a long chase, dan. Yes. What detained you? Never mind the wisecracks. Still on the garlic, huh? Well, nevertheless, it looks like you're out of luck this time. Apparently. Come on! Come out of it. Okay, you win. I always win. If you try to pull another break like that on me, i'll deliver you in a basket. Let's go. Well, now what? A boat and then, uh, san quentin. Can i get my clothes? Well, they're on the boat. Considerate. Yeah. You know, i thought i'd ditched you way back in berlin. When i left frisco, the chief said to me, "steve, don't come back alone," and he knew i wouldn't. I'll be a son of a sea cow. Well, if it ain't the light-fingered skippy. - Hi, dan. - Hello, skippy. So this is your hideout. Hong kong must be pretty soft. I like it fine. Yeah, well, you better walk around that u.s.a. Of america like it was a swamp. It's getting so a guy can't go nowheres nowadays without bumping into all sorts of people. Butte wants you. Detroit wants you. Sacramento wants you. I'm wanted everywhere and welcome nowhere. I'm just a vagabond. Oh, that's too bad. You can't win all the time. Come on. Anything i can do for you here, dan? You might poison him. Hey, flatfoot, tell those bulls i'm an alien! The stateroom is like a turkish bath. Thanks for the outing. Oh, i couldn't stand it myself. Thanks anyhow. Hey, how long - the cuffs? I'm taking no chances. They broke five of my pals when you escaped. Well, that wasn't right. They did all they could. They were shooting at me for three blocks. Yeah, well, it's lucky for you i wasn't among them. Yes. Undoubtedly. I may as well tell you now, i'm not such a good sailor. - Get seasick, huh? - Mm-hmm. Well, you better enjoy everything while you can - good or bad. I suppose that includes being harnessed to you, garlic and all. Well, anyway, you better stand it and like it. I'm afraid i can't agree to like it. Suppose the ship were to sink. Imagine my embarrassment to be found dead anchored to you. This ship ain't gonna sink. Oh, they've been known to. Well, listen, sucker, when it does, i'll make you a little present of this. When i was a kid, i used to swim around a pier like that. Remember your kid swimming days? No. Didn't you ever have a boyhood? Can't you swim? No. Huh. What's so funny? I was wondering what you would do if you were a cop in venice. Is that supposed to be a funny crack? Well, it has its humorous side. Man overboard! It's all right! I've got him! There you are. Reach for the log. Stop. Hold on. It's lucky for you i knew where that key was. Yeah, thanks. Hey, you know, somebody must have left that rail unfastened. Leaning there, and all of a sudden, we're in the ocean. Yes. We ought to sue the company. I still can't see why you saved my life with what's facing you. Suppose we don't discuss that. Well, anyway, l- i kind of feel like i ought to do you a little favor. What, for a little thing like your life? I'll tell you what you can do. What? Those are not particularly becoming to the well-dressed man. Besides, once this ship's at sea, there's no chance for a getaway. Kind of tough on both of us to be ironed. What do you say? All right, then. Thanks. But if you try to pull a fast one on me, i'll knock you off cold, is that understood? Obviously. I ain't kidding. I couldn't suspect you of that. Well, it's kind of stuffy in here. All right if i go on deck? Sure. But i'll go along with you. I have an important message to deliver to her, and like an idiot, i forgot her last name. Her first name is joan. I'm sorry - she's about, oh, she's about so tall, jet-black hair, and large brown eyes. Well, without her last name, it'd be awfully hard for me to find her. You must come and see us sometime! No more parties. No more cigarettes. No more dancing. And no more cocktails. You're cutting your months into weeks, your weeks into days. My days into hours. Is that it? It is. What you really mean, and you're too kind to say, is that if i stay in my stateroom, lie in bed, deny myself everything, even the - the mildest diversion, i may live to arrive at that charming sanitarium. You state it very cruelly. It's not a pretty picture, is it? All right. All right, doctor. I'll do what you say. Hmph. Funny how we cling to life even after it's worthless. She's about so tall, black hair, and large brown eyes. Her first name is joan. Oh, no. No, i was wrong. I know now what i want. I want to crowd all the intense, beautiful happiness possible into what life i've got left. That's all living's for. If it's only for a few hours, i want to have it, and i'm going to have it - all i can get my hands on. Joan, i - now, doctor, i am going on deck. But, j- goodbye! I don't know. She might have been in here, but i didn't notice her. Hmm. Well, then she wasn't here. You'd have noticed her. Hello, dan. Hello, joan. The luck's come back. This time, in full glasses. We mustn't lose a drop, then. Health. Luck. The day knows how to go out - with a blaze of glory. Forgive me if i'm going poetic on you. But life is wonderful, dan. And its best moment is when we find it out. Now we must be going. - Oh, countess! - No, no, no, no. You forgive me. I'm very fatigued. Some other time. Oh, countess, are you of the bavarian barilhauses? The elder son. I had the pleasure of meeting them last summer. Delightful. We must have tea together sometime. Countess, you played divinely. Shall i see you later, countess? Not tonight, sir harold. Tomorrow night, i promise you. I shall live in anticipation. Don't let the royalty get you down. Well, if it ain't - play dead, chump. Tail me to my joint. Something i can do for you, sir? Buttermilk. Yes, sir. Say, pal, will you do me a favor? Yes, sir? What do you call a countess when you want to speak to her? Hmm. Madame la comtesse. Thank you. Say, don't you ever breathe? Ahh. What's the idea of all the landscape gardening? Oh, straight gin is so vulgar, my dear... oh, boy, are my pups growling. Betty, don't they ever get on to you? You've been getting away with this for years. Who are you supposed to be now? Sucker, meet bettina. La comtesse de barilhaus. Oh, barilhaus. Oh, i get it - barrel house betty - barilhaus. Sure. Ha ha. Have you got anything lined up? Did you get a load of that englishman with the single cheater? I did. Full face, he looks like the bank of england. Look, i had an idea - now, lay off. No petty larceny on this one. Say, if i make this touch, i'm through. I'm sick of jumping every time there's a knock at the door. You know, this sticky stuff's bad for my scalp. Hmm. I guess i'm just tired. You hustlers are all alike. Spend all your time in a twilight sleep. What do you got on your mind? Say, i'm a sucker, just like the rest of them. I want a chicken ranch. Oh, sure, i know that one, too. All you need is 5,000 hens and one rooster. That's the setup. Stop kidding yourself, betty. You'll be riding these tubs till they count 10 over you. I may fool you. I hope you do. Spray your throat. Here's to the rooster. Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck. Say, who's the mug with dan hardesty? He's a copper, and the toughest one out of frisco. Pinch? Nothing else. Tough rap? The toughest. Murder? If you can call it murder for croaking the dirtiest heel that ever lived. Well, any chance to beat the rap? No, no. He's already been sentenced. Well, then how's he - he broke. He broke when they were taking him to san quentin. The rope. He's a swell guy, too. Tsk. Gee, came to the front for me in singapore when i was in row. And i was in row. He took a long chance for me. I certainly wish i could pay him back the same way. Look. He's got everything - strength, youth, courage. Everything that makes life fit to live. It's just a ghost. Is it late? Does it matter? Not anymore. The world and time... seem somewhere else. Death ain't tough enough. He's got to fall in love. Let's take a turn around the deck. I do 40 laps a day. Keeps you in shape. What's the percentage of me keeping in shape? Well, it's better than mooning around the deck all night. Oh, good morning. Hello. May i present mr. Burke. Miss ames. - How do you do? - How do you do? Mr. Burke is an old friend of mine. We're traveling together. How nice. Yeah, we're together all the time. Practically inseparable. Well, i'm taking him for the afternoon. Come along, dan. Well, that's all right. Hey, you little tramp! I ought to throw you overboard! Oh! Oh! Isn't it possible for a lady to go anywhere nowadays without bumping into all sorts of people?! If i had you on shore, i'd - oh, i'm so frightened. Uh, nobody's gonna harm you. Oh, you are good. So brave. I am very, very grateful. Aw, don't mention it... madame la comtesse. Oh, you know me, ah? Who i am. I have not the pleasure to know you. Well, my name's steve burke. Delighted. Monsieur burke. Now, come. You sit down with me for a few minutes, hmm? Oh, that terrible man, he might come back. Nobody's gonna bother you, not with me here. You know, i could not feel safer if i thought you were a policeman. Say, now, listen, lady... hey. Oh, yes! I almost forgot - my change. I beg your pardon, sir. What was it you gave me? I gave you a $5 bill. Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. Sorry, sir. Oh, oh, wait, you only took out for one drink. I had three. Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. Think nothing of it, my good man. Ah. I beg your pardon. After you, sir. Say, how long is this parade gonna last? Oh, you won't talk, huh? No, you don't. No, you don't. It's my turn now. Well, you got away with it that time, but i know what you look like, and it won't happen again. Dan, dan, wait. Oh, my dear. What is it, joan? I'm all right. Let's - let's go out on deck. Why, yes, of course, dear. Better? Much better out here. It is rather nice to get away from people, isn't it? Oh, dan, i'm so happy. Tomorrow, honolulu. I have the whole day planned. First, we'll hire a car, drive across the pali. Just we two, hmm? Yes. You don't sound very enthusiastic. Only because... there's something that may prevent my going ashore. Oh, dan, and i'd counted on it so. Well, don't worry. I'll get out of it somehow. Sweetheart. Think you can lose your friend steve? I'll make it my supreme effort. You know, i can't dance with everybody, but with you, countess... you know, steven dances like a gigolo. Well, i wouldn't say that exactly. You two ain't so bad yourselves. Why ain't you going at it? I'm saving my strength for tomorrow in honolulu. Dan's taking me for a long drive. Oh, so you're going for a long ride, huh? That's swell. I think i need a lemonade. Come, steven. We'll see you later. Au revoir. What's the matter, steven? I wonder if that guy back there thinks he's bullying me. Why? What about? Well, i may as well tell you now. We ain't pals. He's my prisoner. What? You are police officer? Sergeant, first-grade. Oh. And i know what's going on in that guy's mind like i can open it and look in it. Oh, you're wonderful. You know, i always wanted to meet a detective. Honolulu's the last stop. That means it's his last chance to make a getaway. And that's what that guy's thinking - thinking every moment. He's only wasting his time. Across the island, i know the most divine spot. I'll take you there and have you all to myself. Let him once get near the shore, and he'll risk his life to make a getaway. But if he makes one phony move... oh, you frighten me. What are you going to do? I'm gonna put him in the brig. Brig? What is brig? That's what they call a jail on a ship. Good night, dan. Good night, joan. Until tomorrow. What's the matter? From the copper's gun! How'd you get 'em? Now get this. You go to dan hardesty. You're slated for the brig any minute. I was afraid of that. But look. From burke's gun? Yeah, betty pulled his teeth. That gives me a chance. Hey, and here's a bankroll. You'll need it. Compliments of betty. English money? Well, that's the only kind sir harold had. What a girl. Come on, dan, get going. Thanks, skippy. All the luck in the world, pal. I'll need it. He won't get out of there. That's okay. Can i help you bring him down? No, no. I don't need any help. I can handle him myself. I'd like you to deliver this to miss joan ames in stateroom b-55... about an hour after the ship docks in honolulu. Yes, sir. You understand, about an hour after we dock. Not before that. Very good, sir. And don't disturb me for a couple of hours. I think i'll take a nap. I'll ring if i want you. Very good, sir. Well, pal, you look pretty smooth. Going ashore? Yeah, but i'm sorry, pal. You're going in the brig. That's a bit tough, but i can't say i blame you. Yeah, you know how it is. A guy's got to do his duty. Not bad. And now, if you've no serious objections, pal, let's get going. No objections. All right, pal, across the hall and down through the engine room. Listen, sucker, next time you take the shells out of a smart guy's gun, remember to put some blanks back. Dan is in the brig. The copper's got the key here. Oh. Good morning. I was just waiting for mr. Burke to take me ashore. Seen dan? Uh, no. No, but he'll be along soon. Good morning, ladies. Good morning, mr. Burke. Oh! Doesn't he look handsome? Have you seen dan anywhere? Why, no, i have- i haven't. We've got to go. See you ashore. Au revoir. Gee, that was a tough spot. Poor kl- le pauvre enfant. Ha! The cop and betty have gone ashore. Give them plenty of time for a head start. Dan! Oh, dan. Dan, i've been looking all over for you. I'm so sorry, but i - it's all right, now that you're here now. Well, come on, let's go, shall we? Of course. Wait till i get this up. There we are. Good morning, mr. Hardesty. Good morning, doctor. Now, please be careful. Not too strenuous today. Don't you worry about me, old dear. Come along, dan. Goodbye. It happened so fast - oh! Oh! That terrible drunk again! When you get to frisco, i'll pop you in the can so fast, you won't come out till chinese new year! Buddy, when i get back to frisco, you'll be tripping over your beard. Now, if you don't mind waiting for just a couple of moments, i have a little surprise for you. I'll wait. So i've got to get out of here today. I see. I've got the man. Have you got plenty of money? There she is. You can't miss it. What time do we sail? Just as soon as it's dark. We'll be ready to shove off the minute you step aboard. Good. Oh! Gardenias, pikake, and camellia. It's too beautiful. Now, over the pali. We're off. I could stay here forever. I wonder. I know it. Would you be content to spend the rest of your life with me in some... faraway place? Anywhere, dan. Why so serious? Joan, dear, i've got to tell you this. Dan, if it's serious, i don't want to hear it. But i must tell you this. Not today. But, my dear - shh. May i have a cigarette? You're incorrigible. Oh, boy, it's dark in there. $4, please. This is living, isn't it, dan? Could we ask for more? Only... that it would never end. It won't end, will it, dan? My dear, whatever happens... we belong to each other always. Hold me closer. What's this, tears? Oh. I can't help feeling a little bit sad. It's been such a happy day. I guess we... we ought to go back, shouldn't we? I suppose so. The dock's over there, dan. Yes, it's still there. The gangplank's there. We can make it if we hurry. Joan, dear... dan, we'll have to hurry. - I've got to tell you this. - What? You must go the rest of the way alone. What do you mean? I've been trying to tell you all day. I'm not going back on the ship. You're... not going back on the ship? I can't go back, dear, because i'm an es- my dear? Joan? Dear? Might i help you? Yes. Will you turn the car around and keep the engine going? Yes. Is she all right, doctor? I believe so. Dan? Yes, dear? Dan... don't leave me. Poor guy. What did you say? Oh, i didn't say nothing. Aloha oe aloha oe... ah, you're a swell guy, steve. Get out of here and never come back! If you ever come back... don't forget to write, now, will you? Don't you ever come back here! And the next stop, sucker, is san francisco. I'm sorry to disturb you. It's you, doctor. Oh, nothing's happened. I just want to have a little talk with you. Well? You're the only one that can help me. Her condition is desperate. She must have absolute quiet and rest if she's to reach the mainland alive. She survived this attack, but it isn't humanly possible for her to survive another. The slightest excitement might kill her. A shock surely would. Can i depend upon you? Of course. Thank you. Now try and get a little more rest. Oh, doctor? I've got to tell you this. There is a shock coming, and i don't know how to avoid it. When we reach san francisco, i'll be met by the police. They're taking me to san quentin... for murder. I'll play you a game of pegs. And i think you'd better rest. You're beginning to even look like my doctor. You shouldn't come here. Oh, fine. Sue me. I came to pay you the money i owe you. - Sir harold? - Uh-huh. I thought i told you to lay off him. Well, what was the use of letting him go to waste? You weren't using him. I've been busy. Ah, sure - with that copper. You know, i think you're falling for him. He's not such a bad guy. Oh, sure. Copper lover! Falling for the law. The fox falling in love with the hounds. I'm ashamed of you. I tell you, that guy is no good. Now, wait a minute. His racket's on the other side of the fence, but he's playing it on the up-and-up. He's 100% copper, just the same as you're 100% thief. And you know yourself - at the head of the class. I wonder if i'm hearing all this right. Scram. Good night, countess. Quick, bartender, get me a drink, quick. Yes, sir. Quick, before the fight begins. Yes, sir. Here you are, sir. Good, give me another - another one, quick. Quick, before the fight begins! Wait a minute, wait a minute. What fight? The fight between you and me. I can't pay for these drinks. The golden gate. I remember an old hymn. How did it go? Keep those golden gates wide open. Keep those gates ajar. Yes, i remember that. I was born here in san francisco, and when i was a youngster, i used to think they were singing about this golden gate. I thought it was the only one. I hope you were wrong. I hope so. Lovely, isn't it? Voila. Your san francisco, hmm? Home. Yeah. Here, get a load of this. Well, i've seen some royalty in me time, but i thought she was the grandest of the lot. Oh. I hate to deliver it. You know, i'm sort of tired of being a copper. Oh, i don't know. L- i just sort of feel that i won't enjoy being the law anymore, after what's happened. And i was wondering if you'd be willing... well, i sort of... i sort of thought that... well, anyway, i got a ranch half paid for. A ranch? Sure. I got a chicken ranch in petaluma. Oh, i'd love it, steven, but there's something i have to tell you first. Ah, you're a right guy, and i'm gonna come clean with you. In the first place, i'm not a count- beg your pardon, sir. You were saying? I was saying, i'm not any of the things you think i am. I've been a long way, and i've left a wide trail. If it's your past, mine ain't been no bed of violets. What do you say we forget about it? Let's start from scratch. You on the level, steve? On the level. What do you say, countess? Don't smear my bangs. Remember our first? We thought it was our last. You never can tell. Four glorious weeks. So many happy hours. And there's so many more, too. Aren't there, dan? Of course, dear. We mustn't miss one of them. We won't, dear. Where shall we dine tonight? Does it matter? Not as long as we're together, but... it's fun to plan ahead. Let's see. I'd like to be in caliente for new year's. Just a month, isn't it? Well, then, here's to agua caliente, new year's eve. Nothing can keep me away. Nor me. I'll finish packing and join you. All right, sweet. Sorry, dan. You have to use those? I've got to deliver you according to hoyle. It's murder. If we can get off the boat without her seeing us... i'll do my best. Thanks. Let's go. You could have knocked me down with a belaying pin. And then, as nice as you please, he put the handcuffs on him. Where's mr. Hardesty? I was just telling her, miss - right here, in front of me very eyes, his friend, his best pal, as you might rightly call him, takes out a pair of handcuffs, and snap, snap, and he's a prisoner. And with their hands at their side, out they goes. Dan? The very same, miss, and a nicer gentleman you wouldn't wish to meet. And him - a red-handed murderer. And he has me bobbing in and out of here with no thought of me own life, turning me back on him. Why, he might have cut my throat from ear to ear. Dan. Joan! Goodbye, dan. Not goodbye, dear. Auf wiedersehen... until new year's eve. Auf wiedersehen. I'll be glad when this thing's over. You're telling me. These holidays are dynamite. Hey, look out for them glasses with your elbow. I never touched any glasses.
