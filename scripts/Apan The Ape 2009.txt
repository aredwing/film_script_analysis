You need to replace the brake pads in front, they're shot. Could you give me a hand? Give it a push. -That's not going to work. -Yes, it will. Right. Hello. No. Tonight? We'll see. That's all I can say right now. It's possible, all right... Sure. Well, take care, Mom. I'll call you later. Good morning. You had me worried there. I didn't know when you'd get here, so I sent your student home. -Good, you took care of it. -Your next student's in the car. -A private lesson? -Make it to the next lesson on time. -Excuse me? -Please be here on time. -You're always running late. -Relax, everything will be fine. Right. Go ahead, start it up. It's better to release the parking brake first, isn't it? Let's see... Here we go. And why do we do that? -Because it's ''eco-driving''. -That's right. Was that a good move? Starting in second gear like that? -Oh, right... -Well, was it a good move? -Make a left turn here. -Here? -Don't you...? -Aim for smoother driving. -Who has the right of way here? -I do. -Where should I go now? -Make a right turn. Done anything special over the weekend? Well... I had dinner with... Hang on. This is a pretty narrow street. ''Quarter to three'', remember? Why do we maintain a quarter-to-three grip? -I thought it was ''ten to two''... -That was back in Grandpa's day. These days, it's quarter to three. Why is that? I don't know, maybe clocks are different nowadays... Make a right here. It would be a shame if the airbag smashed your face, wouldn't it? -That's why it's quarter to three. -Right. Right. Stop! Christ! What are you, stupid? What do I do now? I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. You can find your way back, can't you? -All by myself? -Yeah. I can... Hi. It's me. I want to talk to you. Please call me. Hope everything's okay. Bye. -Coffee, please. -A regular drip coffee? -Large or small? -I'll take a large. -Milk? -No. Listen, I won't be back anymore today. Well, because... Because I won't, that's all. No. Then I guess you'll have to cancel them. Really? That's great, good for her. Because that's just how it is. No, no... Hello. Really? She didn't? She has a stomach flu. That's right. I don't know. Okay. Bye. Hi there, can I help you? I'm checking these out. The circular saws? This model's 4 995. And this one costs 9 995. This one's top-of-the-line, but this one's pretty good, too. It has a bevel feature... -Hello. -Hey. -Looking good out there. -What brings you here? -I felt like working on my game. -Sorry, I'm busy right now. -What about after that guy? -All right, but warm up first. They're on. - Two more. Get moving. Dead ball? Hello? - What the hell! -You ready? -Yeah. I'll go for a serve. Nice serve. Come on, one more. You've got to focus. That one's out. You're scattering the balls. Good! -How are you? -Fine. No! That's all right. -Are you okay? -I'm fine. I feel great. And you? Don't forget to cool down. Get the balls, all right? I've got to run. See you next week, all right? -What? -Next week, same time. -See you. -Bye. Hi. Listen. Come on... Could you spare some shower gel? Thanks. What brought you here today? -Well... -What? Want some shampoo, too? Go on, have some more. Knock yourself out. Help yourself... Take the shampoo, Krister. Then go home to your family. Watch TV, Idol or whatever. Daddy! It hurts. Everything's going to be all right. Here you go. Hey! Don't fall asleep. You can't go to sleep now. You can't sleep here. Hey! Did you dream anything? Tell me about your dream. Hey! Hello! In here. One, two, three! You're doing great, buddy. There... -Are they ready? -Yes, they are. Are you feeling any better? Is he going to be okay? I can't say, but he's getting the best care we have to offer. Wait here. Hello. I've got some combustible stuff to dump. Incinerator, that's the second ramp. Is something wrong? What's happened here? There are so many people running around. -You wonder to what's going on? -Yes. -How's things? -Fine, thanks. Yeah, hello? Yes. At our place? Oh, but it's... That's the repairman. Right. I'm on my way now but I'm by myself. Of course. Okay. See you then. Hi. Come in. Come here. Hello there. Come in, I'll get the door. Cheers! Delicious. Do you want to see my paintings? Look at the eye. I worked a long time on it. What do you think? I think it's really, really nice. -You did a great job. -But it's not finished yet. Where the hell...? Oh, here it is. Pretty gruesome. Don't you think? I was asking you. Do you think it's gruesome at first, but nice? -Or can't you say it's nice because... -Yeah, I think it's exciting. -''Exciting''? -I like it. I really do. -Gruesome at first, but I like it now. -Because I say so? No, I told you I like it. I really like it a lot. I like the composition. That one's big, and hungry. That one's little...it gets eaten. I've bought a jacuzzi, so we're installing it. -A what? -Jacuzzi. Oh, is that why they couldn't come? They're working? -What? -With the jacuzzi? Working on it? I really don't know, Mom. -It'll be nice? -It'll be really nice. Just a second. I have to get this, I'll be right back. Yes, who? No, I'm busy until at least 10-1 1, so I don't think I can. No, but I can contact... What did you say? Yes? No, I haven't seen him. I haven't. How long do you think it'll take? Can you take out the trash, please? Can you please take out the trash? - And bring in the wine? -What? Bring me the wine too! Dinner's almost ready. Krister? -Hey, Krister. -Hey there. Long time, no see. Hi. -How are things? -They're great. The wife's out of town so I went to a friend's for a beer. Sofia and the kids went to visit grandpa. -Well... -What? Are you catching this bus too? Take care. Talk to you later. I have to catch this bus. Move my hand to lunchtime. I can see you! You have to shake it. Can I get it gift-wrapped? We're about to close. Is it okay if you wrap it over there? -I want it to be nice. -Can I cut in? I've got exact change. Thank you. Really nice of you. How? It was a pretty ugly wound. We don't think he has any internal injuries, at least. He's still under anesthesia, the body is just doing its job now. -Can I go in? -Of course. CID. -Hey, you... -Hey. -It doesn't hurt as much anymore. -That's good. -I'm going to whisper something. -Yes. -Do you know what I dreamt? -No. I dreamt everyone was animals except for you. They were all animals except for me? What was I then? You were just yourself.
