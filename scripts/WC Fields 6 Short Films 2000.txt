Well, I think you're a naughty, | mean man, to make poor itty me cold. - I'm not gonna let you go without me. | - Oh, why... Seen my wife around? - Huh? | - There. - So, it's you, is it? | I've been laying for you... for the last | three or four days, - Now I'd like to see you. | - Murder! - You can't do this to me! | - I can't, eh? I'm doin' it. - You're gonna get in a lot of trouble. | - Help! Help! - I'd say the same to you, if you take advantage. | - Murder! Help! Say, can't I leave you | alone for one minute, without one of these guys | trying to flirt with you? Huh? Oh. Now, if any of these birds | annoy you, just let me know. Yes, hubby dear. Gee, did you see what he did | to that poor fellow? Boy, that house detective's | wife is going to get some guy murdered. She'll flirt with anybody | that wears pants. Not me, little bright-eyes. - I'm going to join your party. | - Oh, yeah? Well, of all the nerve... Hey, you. Is there a gig by the name | of J. Effington Bellwether... camping in this joint? - Mr. Bellwether is out. | - Well, he'll be out like a light... if he don't come through | with the 40 bucks he owes me... for taking him out | in me fishing boat. Why, the chiseler's been | giving me the runaround for me dough! And I'm gonna take it | out of his hide. You tell | the big lob that. Oh, Mr. Bellwether is a guest in this | hotel. I can't deliver any such message. - But if you care to, leave him a note. | - Well, I've brought me thumb. Will youse write | it out for me? Certainly. | Pleasure. Well, commence, then. "Dear Mr. Bellwether: "Listen, you four-flushin' | horse collar. "If you don't come through | with the jack you owe me, "I'll knock your | sappy-lookin' block off. "There ain't no heel | like you... "gonna put nothin' | over on me... "without gettin' a knuckle massage. "Affectionately Yours, Deep Sea McGurk, alias | the Slaughterhouse Kid. " Finished. | You know, uh... - Okay. | - Hey-ho. Happy days are here... | Hello, Walter. - How do you do, Mr. Bellwether? | - Any telegrams, cablegrams, radios... - Televisions... | - Yes, sir. A little note. A little note? | Oh, thank you, Walter. Thank you, | my bonny boy. Hmm. J. Effington Bellwether, | that's me. Silly little girl. Ah! Dangerous things, | those lighters. I bought one in | Copenhagen one time. It was a combination | cigar lighter and matchbox. The matches | were very good. - Hey, mister! | - Uh, hello little boy. I'm... - Would you give me a dollar? | - Oh, it's a little girl. Hello, little girl. | How old are you? Five years old. - Five years old! | - Would you give me a dollar to put in my bank? I'll give you a dollar | to put in your bank... - If you'll sing me a song. | - Give me the dollar first. Ah, you're more than five. | Go on, get out of here. - Aw, come on. Gimme a dollar. | - Come on, scram. Oom-scray. Get away. I don't care. I got $50 | in my bank already. - You have $50 in your bank? | - Yes. Ah... Probably has a pin | sticking in her, yes. Well, well, Mr. Bellwether. | What are you doing down in Florida? Oh, I was, uh, just | negotiating for a bank. - That's your little girl? | - I don't know whose little girl it is, but she's trying to get money out of me. She's a wonderful | little child, though. I was just playing | with her silken hair. - You can lift me up by my hair if you want to. | - Just as silk and beautiful... "I can lift her up | by her hair if I want to. " - She's as game as a pebble. | - Lift me up! Look at that! | Isn't it wonderful? It really is remarkable. | And light as a feather. Come on! Lift me up! | Lift me up! She wants me to do it again! You know, it really is | something to be proud of. Yes, it's marvelous, you little minx, | you... you wonderful little gal. - Lift me way up! | - Wants me to lift her way up. Wants me to show it | to everybody in the hotel. Look. Why, it's little... Little, uh... Say, was that guy | trying to flirt with you? Who? Oh, you big silly, there hasn't been | a man anywhere near me. Oh, don't try to kid me. If I catch | him playin' around you again, I'll... - pulverize him! | - Oh, you're such a big brute! Now, if any of these fellows | make any wise cracks to you, just tip me off! All right, Daddy dear. How do you do? Oh, I beg your pardon. Rather silly of me, wasn't it? | Now, was that your father? - Oh, no. | - And he was about to strike you? Well, perhaps he would have, | if you hadn't been here. Why, the great | hulking brute. You know, I've never | struck a woman in my life. - You haven't? | - Not even my own mother. Oh, I could see that | you were the very soul of kindness. Oh, I'm very kind, but of course I can be cruel | if needs be. - You can! | - Oh, a veritable tiger! But you have courage | written all over you. It's the laundry marks, dear. Oh, they're going | to play golf. Oh, it must be wonderfully romantic | and secluded out on the golf course. Oh, it's a marvelous game. | I'm going to play this afternoon myself. - Would you like to join me? | - Ooh, I'd love to! - Do you play? | - Oh, no. I wouldn't even know which end of the caddy to use. Oh, but you do know | something about it. Permit me. Thank you. Oh, I just love it out here. - So nice and green and everything. | - Yes, it is. Rather "park-y" | this morning, though. I have never been on such a crowded | golf course in all my life. You little sissy. Did you bring | a ball with you? Wonderful. Now, stand clear, | and keep your eye on the ball. - Everything is form. | - Mm-hmm. This is what they call | the "explosion shot" from the tee. - It won't hurt you. | It won't hurt you at all. - Oh. | - Stand clear, boy. Wrong club. - What? | - Wrong club. Try this putting niblick. A "putting niblick"? Really, the little chap doesn't | understand the nomenclature of the game. Now, stand clear, boy, | and keep your eye on the ball. No, I have it. Stan... It's all right. | Come here. Stand back here. He gets | all hot and bothered about nothing. I lost a very dear friend | in the Canary Islands many years... What are you doing | with a club like this in the bag? Don't play | with these clubs. I lost a very dear friend in | the Canary Islands many years ago. - How dreadful! | - Chap by the name of Pumphrey Pothelwhistle. - Oh-ho, what a funny name. - Ah, he's | one of the Pothelwhistles from Twickenham. If you've ever been | to Twicken... Stop that, will you? Fore! - Whoo! Quite a driver! | - Yes, he is. Yes. | Yes, he is. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Yes, we lost old Pothelwhistle in the | Canary Islands. He was kicked to death. - Oh, that's a shame! | - Yes, kicked to death by two infuriated canary birds. - Oh, why is that? | - Someone had been feeding them meat. I happ... | Excuse me. I... - Anything strange about this, love? | - It does look rather odd. Yes. I think the shaft is warped. | Give me another bat. Ha-ha, that's better! - That's much better. | - Yes. - Now, stand clear, boy, and | keep your eye on the ball. This is what they call "hitting past | the chin," as I told you before. Gives you a remarkable shot. What have you got here, | after all? A pie! Fancy bringing a pie | to a golf course. A pint, yes. But a pie, never. Why, it's like, uh... It's like carrying... carrying, uh... something or other... somewhere or other, as the case may be. Now, you stand clear | and keep your eye on this ball. Stand clear, boy. | Keep your eye on the ball. Stand cl... - Quite a breeze. | - Yes, it is quite a breeze. Yes, there is. | Quite a breeze. Yes. Here's your overcoat. Now, stand clear, boy, | and keep your eye on the ball. - As I say, this is | "hitting past the chin. " Yes. - Hitting as far past the | chin as possible. - Mm-hmm. Never stand close to the ball | after you hit it. - Sounds like one of those birds | that fly backwards. - Stand clear, boy. | Keep your eye on the ball. He's coming this way. - Gives me the creeps. | - Me, too. - Stop that, you! | Stop acting... Stand still. Now, you stand clear and keep your eye | on the ball. Stand still. Don't get moving 'round here | with those inhabited feet of yours. As I was saying, it requires | a great deal of quiet nerve... And slow... Stand still and | keep your eye on the ball. I'm sorry, dear. | Did I lose my temper, huh? What is it? | Ohh! Godfrey Daniel. | Tsk, tsk. Wring your neck. Aah. Put your foot | on that, will you? I wouldn't have you again | with me as a caddy... for all the tea in China. Tea or coffee or chop suey | or whatever it is they have there. I said I'd like | to wring your neck. Like to wash it first, | and then give it a good wring. Give it a "wring" | they'd hear for... miles. Miles. - Would you take that out, please? | - Oh, yes, of cour... Thank you. Put it in there, | will you, girl? Thank you. - This is really disgusting. | - Oh, it's terrible! - I'm sorry that you had to see this. | - Oh, that's all right. Now, stand clear | and keep your eye on the ball. Stand still! Ooh! Keep your eye | on the ball. Mm-hmm. - Hello, Sheriff. | - How are you? The sheriff is looking | for Mr. Bellwether. Ohh. - Well, where is he? | - He's out playing golf with your wife. With my wife? | Come on! Holy smoke, let's get him. - There it is. | - Huh? - There! | - Where? - On the end of your club. | - Oh... - So it is, so it is! | - Oh, yes! What an eye he has. Now, you stand clear | and keep your eye on the ball. Oh, I've forgotten something. Huh? Oh. Probably forgotten | her horse. Well, I won't | need it anyway. Won't need a horse. | Want to ride it... I won't need it either! Here's a club for you | for short holes. Now, stand clear, | and keep your eye on the ball. I lost a horse one time. I forgot him | and left him down the Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon and... That's a beautiful camel | you have with you. Crazy about me. Now, stand clear, boy, and keep... | Don't stand there. Don't you know I'll smite you | on the sconce with this truncheon? He's standing right... | and go, boom away! Great, silly boy. - I'll have to have it reblocked. | - Oh, that's a shame. Yes. Thanks! | Thanks for nothing! You stand clear | and keep your eye on this ball. As I was saying, this is | "hitting past the chin. " - Mm-hmm. | - Stand clear, boy. So it's you, is it? I'd like to take | this club and... - I'll tee that up, dear. | - All right. Now, stand clear and | keep your eye on the ball. Another thing I forgot | to tell you was... keep the wrists | together. - Never let the wrists separate. | Take the club back slow... Now, now. | Ooh! As I was saying before, you've got | to keep the wrists close together. Never let the wrists... Keep the wrists close together. Close together. | Never let the wrists separate. Keep them close together. Keep the wrists | close together. - Where are my glasses? | - They're on your head. Oh. Yeah. | Right. - Where's the newspaper? | - You're sitting on it. Oh. Land o' goshen. | Another baby. Up until May, uh-huh. Say, | that's a funny one. - Look. | - Fifty pounds, and chop it fine. "Mrs. Unclebeck... " | What do you mean, "fifty pounds | and chop it fine"? - Oh, I thought you were Arthur. | - Who's Arthur? He's the man | I intend to marry. Oh, well don't tell me anything | about it. I'm only your father. I can read it in the newspaper. | What does he do? - Well, he's the iceman. | - An iceman? - Yeah, he goes to college. He's a Cornell man. | - Iceman! - Red Grange was an iceman. | - He's still an iceman, as far as I'm concerned. Put it down there | and get out. Okay. Go. | And stay out. Now, you're so smart. How are you | going to get it in the icebox? I'll put it in myself. Listen, don't ever do | that... that to me! Oh, God. Hello, hello, hello. No, he's not in. - Oh, hello, Frobisher. | - I've been waiting for ya! I'll meet you on the first tee. | Hurry up over. Okay, Charlie. Okay. | I'll be over in a half a tick. Okay. All right. Did you put the ice in the icebox? | - Yeah. - How'd you do it? | - It was easy. - Where are my golf clubs? | - In your golf bag. Yeah, but where is the golf... bag? - You just fell over it. | - Yeah. I see that. Look at that. | Look at that. I don't know. Where did that | good old driver go? Oh, that's enough. - What's my first appointment this morning? | - Miss Pepitone, at 10:30. Well, I just have time | for 18 holes. - Where's my cap? | - You never wear any. - Oh, yeah. That's right. | - Where's the ice? - In the icebox! | - There's just a little piece left. Now I'll have | to get some more. Keep that iceman out of here. | I'm gonna order a Frigidaire. - That's mine. | - Oh, yeah. Well, we can't | look for it all day. We've been at it | twenty minutes now, and I got to get back | to the office at half past ten. - I'm gonna drop another ball. | - Okay, drop another. If it isn't unfair | to either of you gentlemen, - I can tell you where the ball is. | - Where? Under that leaf. Thanks. "If it isn't unfair to either of us. " | We've been looking for the ball 20 minutes. - Fore! | - I'd wait a minute. They're still on the green. Well, let 'em | get out of the way. - This is certainly a great game | for your health. "A ball lying in | a sprinkler connection... may be dropped without penalty, | no nearer the hole. " Get those teeth out of there too. | They're right in my line. - Two. | - You can't do that! What do you mean, I can't do it? | Read the card. - You had one strok... | - Dropped in the wa... Wha... Don't. - You had two strokes... | - Don't quibble. Don't quibble. Don't quibble. - Snappy little hole. Don't you think so? | - Yes, it is. Give me | the mashie niblick. Mashie niblick... | Oh, thanks. Fore! What are they doing? | Having a basket party over there? Get rid of those ducks. Don't stand there! | Stand over here! Those ducks are | throwin' me off. Over again. Don't stand behind me | when I'm shooting! - You told me to stand over there, sir. | - Never mind where I told you to stand. You stand | where I tell ya. That kid's so dumb | he doesn't know what time it is. - Say, by the way, what time is it? | - I don't know. - 10:15. | - Shut up, will ya? Now, stand clear and | keep your eye on the ball. Oh, wait. | You can't do that. What do you mean | I can't do that? I can do anything | I want to do. You can take this golf course and... - Hello, Joe. | - Hiya, Doc. - How about a little golf? | - Ah, just threw my clubs away. - What, again? | - The funniest thing happened. I'm takin' my second stroke. I bean an | old geezer on the sconce with my ball. Right near the green. | It was headed for the pin. The ball rolls back | into a water connection. I pick it up, | drop it over my shoulder, it dribbles down | into the hole! - I'm down in two. | - Well, uh... What do you mean, "Well"? | They gave me the same argument. I'm down in two. | Look at the back of the card. They wanted me to do it over again, | after I had a fine drop. - Where's the soap? | - It's in your hand. Huh? Oh. - How 'bout tomorrow, Doc? | - Uh, what time? - Oh, about... | - No, I won't be able to go. - Why not? | - I'm going duck shooting. - Well, I'll run along... | - Say, boy. You should have been there. - What? | - I took this mashie niblick, see... I hit this straight shot for the pin. It beans this old geezer. - Down into the water connection | it goes. Coming back... Oh, to hell with her! - Drops into | the water connection, I pick it up... and drop it over my shoulder | and down into the hole it goes! - Well, I'll give you a ring tomorrow, Doc. | - Okay. Were they burned up! You could have fried eggs | on the back of his neck. Send her in. How do you do? | Will you sit down? Put it in here, please. You won't hurt | my leg, will you? My doctor says | I have a very bad leg. Your doctor | is off his nut. I don't believe | in doctors, anyway. There's a doctor lives | right down the street here. Treated a man | for yellow jaundice for nine years, and then found out | he was a Jap. - You know, a little dog bit me the other day. | - Dr. Coolataw. He bit me right here. - Dog bit you? | - Yes. It was a little dachshund. - Oh, yeah. | - A little tiny dog, but he sneaked up behind me... and bit me | right like that! You're rather fortunate it wasn't | a Newfoundland dog that bit you. Will you sit down? - Shall I use gas? | - Well, gas or electric light. I'd feel nervous to have you | fool around me in the dark. Come on, this isn't gonna hurt now. | I just want to look in there. It's not gonna hurt. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on, now. I'll try not to be so cruel this time. | Come on. Come on! Ow! - Oh, Doctor, I can't let you do that again! Oh! | - Hmm. - Tell her I'm out. | - But, Doctor, she has a 3:00 appointment. I wouldn't care if she had | a 4:00 appointment. Boy, when I was in Darjeeling, | oh, it was tigers... What? | Tell her I'm out! Go on out there | and tell her I'm out. How do you do? | How are ya? We've been waiting for you. Sit down. When I tell ya to go out and tell | one of these palookas... that I'm out, go out | and tell them I'm out. Don't have these buzzards | walk in on me. I... When I don't want | to see 'em, I don't... When I don't wanna | see 'em, I don't wanna see 'em. Don't stand there | and look at me that way. Now, I'm... You just come in | for the ride? Haven't I seen your face | somewhere before? Oh, probably you've seen me | at the horse show. - Jockey? | - Sir. Mm. Oh, yeah. | Can you open your mouth? Come on now. You've got | a bigger mouth than that. Open up. Mm. | Oh, beautiful! Yeah. Hand me that 404 | circular buzz saw, will you? Dropping, dropping | Dropping, dropping Is that a 4-0-4 conical | you've given me? Ah. There you are. | Now, that didn't hurt, did it? I knew | it wouldn't hurt you. Uh, here. | Give me that packing, please. Thank you. Put that tin there | and just stuff it in her mouth. Pardon me for | just a moment. You wouldn't let Arthur | come here to see me, so I'm going to see him. You're gonna do nothing of the kind. Excuse me a moment, folks! Get up there. | Come on. Get up there. Get up there! | Hyah! And stay in there. | Now, what do you think of that? Keep you waiting? You said a mouthful, there. | Open it... just a moment, there. All your lines busy? Why, it came out easily, | didn't it? Yes, it did. | Yes, it did. It surprised me. Open wide. Open wide. Uh, excuse me just a... - Open that door! | - I can't. You locked me in. - Where's the key? | - In your pocket. Huh? Oh. Stop it. Shh! Shh! Stay there. | There are people downstairs. - Any patients? Huh? | - Miss Macy. Oh. Oh, yes. - Have you ever had this tooth pulled before? | - No! This won't hurt you... | much. Get your foot out of the... | Get it out! Janice, help! Thank you. Whew! - I'm gonna give her gas. | - Ooh! Not gonna pull me | all around the floor. Ow! Relax. Would you like a drink? - What is it? | - Water. No, thanks. Stop! Cease. Well, it won't | be long now. - That female wrestler gone? | - Yes, she's gone. Is he standing | in a hole? No, he's just | a little fella. Hmm. Send him in. | I'll fix him. This way, please. How do you do? | How's everything up in Moscow? Got two strikes on the boys, eh? | Will you sit down? Thank you. I can't find his mouth. Hand me that stethoscope, | will you? Thanks. | Will you say "ahh" please? - Ahh. Ahh! Ahh! | - Again? Again? - I almost had it. Ag-Again? | - Ahh. - Ha. Ohh. | - Ahh. Ahh. Ahh. Ah, I got it here! | Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. And a very | pretty thing too. Yes. Let me see, now. Hand me that drill. Thank you. Now, just | open your mouth. This can't hurt. Okay. You can't say | that hurt you. Doctor, your daughter is | going out with the iceman. - Don't be silly. I got her locked in the room. | - But they're using a ladder. - Where do you think you're going? | - That's him! - So, you're they guy that hit my father on the head. | - Wanna make anything out of it? - I'd like to see you do that again. | - Is it necessary to do it again? No, it isn't! Father, you're not really | going to buy a Frigidaire, are you? Fifty pounds, | and make it snappy. - Who's thar? | - Officer Postlewhistle of the Canadian Mounted. - Hello, officer. | - Good evening, Mr. Snavely. - Is it still snowin'? | - I don't know. To tell you the truth, I never looked. - Did you get your man? | - Not yet, but I got my eye on 'im. Well, that's somethin'. - You pullin' out? | - Figurin' on goin' over the Rim tonight. How's your son Chester? You heared | from him lately? I ain't a-heared | from Chester... it'll be a year, | come Michaelmas. I was thinkin' of the song | that you writ about him. I wanted to sing it | to my wife last night. You know, we got a boy | just about Chester's age... who's got a hankerin' | to go to the city. - Have you got your dulcimer here? | - Yes, I have, officer. I wonder if you would mind | singin' me that song. I'd be tickled to death. You'll have to excuse me, | though, if my voice isn't just right. You know, we can't get any ipecac | up in this part of the country. Go right ahead, | Mr. Snavely. You won't consider me rude | if I play with my mitts on, will you? Not at all, Mr. Snavely. | Not at all. There was once | a poor boy And he left | his country home And he came to the city | to look for work He promised | his ma and pa He would lead | a sinless life And always shun | the fatal curse of drink Once in the city He got a situation | in a quarry And there he made | the acquaintance Of some | college students He little thought | they were demons For they wore | the best of clothes But good clothes | do not always make the gentleman So they tempted him | to drink And they said | he was a coward Until at last he took | The fatal glass of beer When he found | what he'd done He dashed the glass | upon the floor And he staggered | through the door With delirium tremens Once upon the sidewalk He met | a Salvation Army girl And wickedly | he broke her tambourine All she said | was "Heaven... "Heaven bless you" And placed a mark | upon his brow With a kick | she'd learned Before she had been saved Now, as a moral | to young men Who come down | to the city Don't go 'round breaking | people's tambourines That certainly is a sad song. Don't cry, constable. It is a sad song. My Uncle Ichabod said, | speakin' of the city, "It ain't no place | for women, gal, but pretty men go thar. " He always said somethin' | to make you split your sides a-laughin'. Comical old gentleman he was. Well, I think I'll | be a-hightailin' it over the Rim. - And it ain't a fit night out | for man nor beast. Otto! Ahh! Hee! Otto, mush! Otto! Otto! Mush! | Mush! Hee! Otto! | Mush! March! March! Tastes more like corn flakes. March! March! Hee! - And it ain't a fit night out | for man nor beast. Hullo-wah! Hello there! Hello! Hello. - How, Mr. Snavely? | - How, Chief. - How. | - And how. Vamoose! Oom-scray. Lamb. It ain't a fit night out | for man nor beast. And it's been a-stormin' | for almost a "fort-nit. " - Who's thar? | - It's me, Ma. Did you find any gold | down at the gulf, Pa? I found that "nougat. " | It be on the table. A "nougat. " | A golden "nougat. " Just what you been a-combin' them thar | hills for for nigh on to 30 years. It must be worth | almost a hundred dollars. Help to pay off the mortgage | on the old shack. Has that pill from Medicine Hat | been here again? - Yes, and he wants more money. | - Rot his hide. He wants more money, and if he | don't get it, he'll take our malamute. - He won't take old Bozo, my lead dog. | - Why not, Pa? 'Cause I 'et him. You 'et him? He was mighty good | with mustard. We was a-mushing over | Blind Nag Rim last night. I got mighty hungry. You better take | your mukluks off, Pa. Captain Pepitone | of the Canadian Mounted... smuggled a police dog | across the border for you. Smuggled a police dog | across the border for me? Yes, and he says for you | to keep it under your hat. - How big is it? | - About so high. He's crazy. Pa, it's just | three years today... since they put our dear son in jail | for stealing them thar bonds. - And I know he never stole 'em. | - Sure he never stole 'em. Our Chester | never stole nothin', from nobody. Hardly ever. Do you think he'll come | headin' for home... when they turn him loose | from that plagued jail? - I reckon, guess and | calculate he will, Ma. Who's thar? Chester! Our son | back again! My own... - Chester, my darling boy! | - Chester! It ain't a fit night out | for man or beast. Don't cry, Ma. We got our son | back again, ain't we? Welcome home, Chester. Thank you, Pa. I don't suppose | we'll have him with us long. Once the city gets | into a boy's system, he loses his hankerin' | for the country. - Sit down, Chester. | - Thank you, Pa. - Will you have some soup, Chester? | - That's my soup, Ma. Hand me that bread | I was dunkin', will ya? Thanks. Dad, I ain't ever gonna leave | the old farm again. - I've come back here | to stay with you and Ma, and I ain't ever | gonna leave again. It's so good | to see you both again. And I'm so glad to be back | home with you and Ma that I can't talk. I'd like to go | to my little bedroom... and lay on the bed | and cry like I was a baby again. Thar, thar. Go to your room and | have a good cry, dear. I know how you feel. I feel so tired, | I think I'll go to bed. Why don't you lie down | and take a little rest first, Chester? - Well, good night, Pa. | - Good night, Chester. - Good night, Ma. | - Good night, Chester. - Sleep well, Chester. | - Thank you, Pa. You too. - Thank you, Chester. | - Sleep well, Chester. - Thank you, Ma. You sleep well. | - Thank you. Don't forget to open | the window a bit. - Don't forget to open yours a bit, Pa. | - I won't, son. Yes, don't forget | to open your window a bit, Chester. - Put yours up a bit, too, Ma? | - Good night, Chester. - Good night, Chester. | - Good night, Pa. - Good night. | - Good night. Good night, Chester. I think I'll go out | and milk the elk. Don't forget | your moose horn, Pa. Thank you, Ma. It ain't a fit night out | for man or beast. Lida. Lida, honey. | Papa's calling. Yoo-hoo! | Papa's calling ya. Lida! My old embouchure | ain't what it used to be. Hello, Lida. Hello, Li... | Say, Elmer, have you seen Lida? Tell her | Mr. Snavely wants... Hello, Li... Certainly a bright | moonlight night tonight. Hello, Li... Hello, Lida. Hey, Lida! It's me! Come here! | Don't you know me? Mr. Snavely. Battered old hide. Chester, did you | steal them bonds? Yes, Ma, | I stole them bonds. I was a bank messenger, | and they caught me fair and square. I wasn't framed. I knowed you stole 'em, but I never would admit it | to your father. If he thought | you stole 'em, it would break | his poor old heart. Never tell him | any different. - Good night, Chester. | - Good night, Ma. And it ain't | a fit night out... for man or beast. Has Chester | gone to bed yet, Ma? I don't think so, Pa. - Chester? | - Yes, Pa? - Can I speak to you a minute, son? | - Yes, Pa. Chester, did you steal | them bonds? I knowed you | stole 'em, son, but I never would admit it | to your mother. She thinks | you're innocent. You must never tell her | any different. If she thought | you stole 'em, it would break | her poor old heart. Oh, it's so good | to be home, Dad. I'm gonna stay here now | with you and Ma for all time. Chester, have you | any of them bonds on you... or any of that money? No, Dad, I ain't got | any of them bonds on me. And I took that tainted money | and threw it away. And you came back... to me and mother. - Yes, Pa. | - Hmm. To sponge on us | the rest of your life, you block... You lug! | Get out of here! Get out... you tramp, you! Get out of here! And it ain't a fit night out | for man or beast. Get out of here! | Get out of here! Stop that! Do you wanna | break that machine? How do you do, Mr. Dilweg? It doesn't matter how I do. | Get out of here. - Hello? | - Hello. Oh, it's you. - Where have you been? | - At the firehouse. - Playing contact bridge with the firemen. | - Did you win? What kind we do | with hose cart? I sold the hook and ladder | to a couple of drunken painters. - Anybody been here since I've been gone? | - Yes, about 50 people. - What did they want? | - Stamps. Do you know since I've had | that big electric sign painted, our stamp business has | picked up 100 percent? - What do they want? | - They've been here since you left about 10:00 this morning. And they haven't made a single move | in three and one half hours. Why don't you get them out of here? | They never buy anything. They just | borrow matches all day. You better come up and get your dinner. | Soup's on the table. Coming right away, dear. | Coming right away. - How about a cocktail? | - They're already mixed. - All you have to do is put in the ice. | - Oh, good. - Hello, Pop. | - Hello. Don't do that. - Will ya stop it? | - What's the matter, Pop? Don't you love me? - Certainly I love you. | - What are you doing? She's not gonna tell me | I don't love her. - Here. You wanna play? | - Goody. Whew! Remind me to order some more stamps | tomorrow, will ya? - That's fine. That's fine. That's enough. | - I wanna do it some more. - Let go, will ya? | - Oh, let me do it just a minute, Pop. Listen, | will you stop it? Gee, let me do it. Is Papa's little angel | going to sit down? Won't Papa's little | doll baby sit down? Or will Papa bust | her sconce in with... What do you mean? | Have you gone crazy? Sit down | and behave yourself. Oh, gee whiz. Mom, what's | technocracy? - Ask your father, dear. | - Pop, what's technocracy? Uh, yes, indeedy. | That's, uh... Say, will you eat your soup | and stop asking silly questions. And stop that. Aw, gee, | I like to pop it. One more pop, | and I'll pop you in the eye. That's pretty. I have a chewing gum olive, and she | makes a martini out... Get out of here! Oh, gee, I'm hungry. Why don't you learn | that kid some manners? Teach, my dear. | Teach. And it might be a good example | if you would take your hat off. I have hay fever. | Another thing is, there's no top in it. That doesn't matter. She's eating | the canary bird! - Godfrey Daniel! | - Get into that room... Wait a minute. | Not yet. - My ear! | - Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Aren't you ashamed | of yourself? - Go over there and behave yourself. | - Sit down there. Oh, gee, Mom. Yeah, just 'cause | I'm a little girl, you hit me. - Pick on somebody your own size. | - Don't be insolent to your father. She should see me down at the firehouse | rassling with them firemen. I take six or eight of them, | throw 'em over my head and backwards. Well, three, anyway. Who taught that parrot | to do that? Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. What did you want to eat | a canary bird for anyway? I couldn't help it. - Hello, kiddo. | - Hello, Leana. - Where have you been? | - Cuthbert and I have been to the Blue Ballroom. Cuthbert, | that sissy. How do you know? | Why, you've never even seen him. I don't have to see him. I never knew | a Cuthbert that wasn't a sissy. When I went to school as a kid, I licked | every kid in school named Cuthbert. Shh. That kid's getting | awfully fresh. If that's for me, I'm taking a bath. | I'll call 'em up later. Hello? | Oh, hello, Cuthbert. - Am I surprised, Cuthbert. | - Am I. No, Cuthbert. Really, Cuthbert? Well, who told you that, | Cuthbert? Somebody would have | to tell him. - He'd never find it out himself. | - Really, Cuthbert? Oh, Cuthbert. Oh, Cuthbert, | that's very, very funny. Yeah, tell it to us. | Make us laugh too. - Well, am I surprised, Cuthbert. | - Yeah, you'd be surprised. - Well, tell me some more about it, Cuthbert. | - Oh, this is getting too much. Tell him more. She's been talking | for an hour. Stop her. Oh, that'll be fine, | Cuthy. Cuthy. | It's Cuthy now. - Be Cuth in a minute, okay? | - You're so cute, Cuthy. - Yeah, I'll bet he's cute. | - You did, Cuthbert? - Mm-hmm. | - Oh, yes, Cuthbert. - Will you make her stop, please? | - She can't be rude, dear. - Yes, I would, Cuthbert. | - You would, huh? - Surely, Cuthbert. | - Yeah. Yes, Cuth. Tomorrow. I tell ya, she's making me sick. That's good. | I'm glad I have to go downstairs. All right. | Sure I will. Hello? | Yes. Yes. This is Dilweg's Drugstore. | Yeah, Mr. Dilweg speaking. What's that? | Box of cough drops? Uh-huh. Yeah, I know | what kind you mean. Yeah, the gentleman with the whiskers, | one on each side, yeah. Yeah. Uh, no. No, I'm very sorry. | We can't split a box. No. Yes, oh, yes, | we can deliver them. Yes. Uh-huh. Where is it? Uh-huh. Eighteen miles | straight out on route 96. Turn to route 13 | and four and a half miles. Yeah, yeah, all right. All right. | A box of cough drops. Yes, yes. We can deliver them | this afternoon. Yes. Uh-huh. I'll send our truck out | with them right away. Yes. All right. Good-bye. Just sold another box | of cough drops. Sit down | in your chair properly. - What do you mean up on your knees? | - I can't do nothin'. Cuthbert! Oh, you silly | thing, you. There goes those chimes again. | I gotta go downstairs. Yes, Cuthbert. - How do you do? | - How do you do? Is there a lady in attendance here? - Huh? | - Is there a lady in attendance here? Oh. Uh, yes, yes. Yes, yes. I'll | be right down. She'll be right down. Thank you. Hurry up downstairs, | dear. There are two ladies | that won't let me wait on 'em. They want a lady | to wait on 'em. - I simply can't go down there. | - They won't tell me what they want. - You sit there and eat. | - I'll go down, Pop. - Will you hurry up? | - Well, if I'm going to clerk in the drugstore, I'll simply have to get | some decent-looking clothes first. Hurry up, dear. | We're gonna lose their trade. She'll be down | in half a moment. You read Mother India? Sex Life of the Polyp? The Grover Boys | in Newsome? Cake a la mode. Fresh every Tuesday. A rather amusing | little beggar. Just a little fly speck, | that's all. Old Moscow | in the winter. Could I interest you | in a stamp? - Yeah, give me a stamp. | - Oh. No. Give me | a purple one. Well, I'm sorry. We haven't any | purple ones. I could paint one for you. I don't want | a painted one. A person hasn't got any rights | in this country anymore. The government | even tells you... - What color stamps you gotta buy. | - Yeah, it's pretty tough. That's the Democratic | Party for you. I've written to Washington | about it. What do you wanna write | to Washington for? He's dead. - How much are your stamps? | - Three cents. - All right. Give me one. | - Oh, thank you. No. Don't give me | that dirty one. Give me a clean one. | Give me the one out of the middle. Well... Sorry to keep you waiting. Pardon my fingers. | Is that all right? - Ah, shall we send it? | - No, I'll take it along. Oh, yes. - Huh? | - You got change for a hundred dollars? No. I'm very sorry. | I haven't. - I'll pay you the next time I come in. | - Just a moment. Just a moment. We're giving these little | souvenirs away with every purchase. Well... We won't be able | to wait much longer. Oh, uh... uh... uh... uh, | she'll be down, uh... she'll be down. She'll be right down. | Just, uh... She won't... Just wait... She'll be right down. Uh, where's | your, uh... - Oh, I'd love to, Cuthbert. | - Dear... - Close the door and get out of here. I'm coming right down. | - Hurry up. Those old ladies are getting very | impatient. We're gonna lose their trade. Oh, Cuthbert. Oh, I think that'd be lovely. That's right. | Eat your spinach. Eat your spinach. She'll be right down now. | Coming now. What can I do for you? Is there | a ladies restroom here? Yes. Right over there. - The first door on your left. | - Thank you. You fool! | Why didn't you tell them? - They didn't ask me anything about it... | - Ohh! They never did tell me. How you gonna know if... How do you do, sir? | How are you? What can I do for you? Huh? Certainly not. You don't think | I'd break the laws... of this great and grand | and glorious United States of ours... just to satisfy | your depraved tastes? A thousand no's. I've never had or sold a bottle | of liquor since I've opened this place. No? Well, | you're not fooling me. - I'll get you yet. | - Huh? Maybe and maybe not. He looked a little screwy | when he came in here. Did I understand you to say you were | giving souvenirs away. - Oh, Mother. | - No, that's all right. Yes, that's all right. Yes, we are, here. - Here. | - Oh, thank you. Oh, Mother, | isn't it lovely? - Aren't you glad I asked? | - Would you like one? - Oh, you're so kind. | - Oh, that's quite all right. Thank you so much. | Aren't they gorgeous? - Whenever you want any stamps, don't forget us. | - Thank you. We won't. I've been in the same place | 15 years now. I control all the stamp business | in this neighborhood. What, more stamps? Is she blotto | or not? Yeah, some smelling salts. | Just crack that bottle off. - That's right. | - Everything's free here. If anybody's hurt, | it's all right. I don't know | who she is. Yeah, she's liable | to get diphtheria there. - Where am I? | - Uh, Dilweg's Drug Company. - Mr. Dilweg here. | - What happened? I don't know. - That horrible man again. | - I never saw her in all my life. - Get her some whiskey. Get whiskey. | - Uh... Hello? Hello? Yeah. Uh-huh. | Mrs. Riggensmith? Those cough drops | haven't arrived? Oh, I'm very sorry. Oh, I'm very sorry, yes. | They'll be there any minute. I sent them out at 3:00 this afternoon | on our truck, yeah. Good-bye. | Good-bye, Mrs. Riggensmith. Wait a minute, dear. | There's so much noise out here, I can't hear | a word you say. There. I want you to meet | a very wonderful young man. - Mr. Smith, this is Mrs. Dilweg. | - How do you do? Oh, dear, come here. I want you to meet | a very wonderful and brave young man. He's just saved my life. - This is my daughter. Mr. Smith. | - Cuthbert! Oh, Leana! I wanna meet Cuthbert! Ha ha ha. Listen, dear, | go upstairs and eat your pogo. - Then you can jump on your spinach after. Go! | - I wanna meet Cuthbert. Pretty good town you got here. You bet we have. A public library and | the largest insane asylum in the state. Come on, Joe. | Let her down. All right, all right. | Slack it up. They sure were great fights | last night, O'Hare. Yes, they were, yeah. | Never saw better fights in my life. - I got a kick out of them. | - So did I. So did I. Fought like | a couple of dressmakers. I see fights like that, I feel | like getting back into condition... and getting into | the fight game myself again. Ah, that's better. Hello, O'Hare. | What do you know? Not a thing. Not a thing. That lug tells his wife | everything he knows. Don't tell him anything. - Good morning, Mr. O'Hare. | - Good morning, Mrs. Coggins. - How's Mr. Coggins? | - He's not so well this morning. Oh, that's unfortunate. | I'm sorry to hear that. - I'm worried about him. | - Yeah, I am too. He was out on one of his benders | last night again. Boy, how he can drink that raw alcohol | and live I don't know. Fine mayor he is. Get out. Get out. | Get out. Get out. Get out of here. All I gotta do all day long | is paint that bowl? Pop, Ma says to come up | and get your vittles right away. Get my vittles? | I'll be right with you, Ronald. - Pop, you wanna hear a riddle? | - I'd love to hear a riddle. - Why is a cat's tail like a long journey? | - I'm afraid you have me, Ronald. - Why is a cat's tail like a long journey? | - 'Cause it's far to the end. Oh, Ronald very good. | Absolutely sidesplitting. - Sit down and eat your dinner. | - What, no meat? Vegetables contain | more minerals. Pop, you wanna hear | another cat riddle? Yes, I would, Ronald. | I'd love to. What looks most like a cat looking | out of a window? I don't know. What looks most | like a domestic feline... contentedly gazing | from the window? I'll tell you, Pop, what looks most | like a cat looking out of a window. Another cat | looking in. Oh, very good, Ronald. | Very good. Eat your spinach. | Eat your spinach. Eat your spinach. - Pop, would you like to hear another riddle? | - Don't encourage him. Eat your carrots. Dear, that shows he's awfully smart. | Mr. Lincoln used to tell riddles. That, as much as anything else, made him | the wonderful president that he was. Pop, why is a load of hay | like a mouse? Don't. | My poor brain. He gives me skull pains | with these terrible riddles. Do you know why a load of hay | is like a mouse? No, Ronald, I do not. I've never noticed a similarity | between a small rodent... and a large amount | of horse's provender. Why does... a small rodent | resemble a load of hay? 'Cause a cat'll eat it. Cat'll eat it? | Cat'll eat it? Very good, Ronald. | Very... Eat your spinach. | Eat your spinach. - Hey, where are you? | - Yeah? Coming, coming. Coming, coming, | coming, coming. - Hey, where are you? | - Coming, coming, coming, coming. I'm coming. Hello. I hear you | wanna to buy a fiddle. Oh, no. I have Lena here. | I'm perfectly satisfied with her. Oh. But him | is a fine fiddle. He may be a fine fiddle, | but I get very sweet music out of Lena. Then somebody told me | that you wanna buy a fiddle. Two weeks ago I did. | But I had Lena all fixed up... and I'm perfectly | satisfied with her now. - And me push him for three miles. | - Oh, I'm sorry about that. Hey, hey, can I keep him here | till I come back from work? Surely. Put him right | in the corner here. - That's fine. | - Put him right in there. - That's okay. That's fine. | - Take good care of him. - I'll take good care of him. | - So long. Good-bye. How do you do, | Miss Sharp? - Have a nice lunch? | - Yes. I had a wonderful steak | at the lunch counter. Steak. I love meat. But we never have it | at our house. My wife's a vegetarian. All we have | is vegetables. Say, I was practicing | last night on Lena out in the garage. And I think I got | that down fine now. - Would you mind listening to it? | - Oh, I'd love to. - You like that? | - I think it's sweet. Yeah, I think it's much better | than it was. Isn't it funny? My wife doesn't think | it's music. Guess she just has | no ear for it. Here's the other one. | This is the second motif. That's more difficult that way when you | have to move your hands around that way. Howdy do, sir? | Will you sit down? - Manicure? | - No. - Haircut or shave? | - Yeah. - I beg your pardon. Isn't your name Flogg? | - Yeah. I thought so. I didn't recognize | your face when you first came in. No, it's all healed up | since I was in here last. Oh, Mr. O'Hare, I see they're offering | a $ 2,000 reward... for that bandit who robbed the bank | in Cucamonga City. Two thousand dollars. | I'd like to get that dough. If I wasn't so busy, | I'd go over and choke that guy to death. I'd teach him not to rob banks | in and around City. Oh, Mr. O'Hare, did you know you had | your hat on backwards? - I beg your pardon? | - Did you know you had your hat on backwards? Oh, no. | Thank you very much. I had it on backwards | day before yesterday... and a friend of mine | came up and kicked me in the stomach. Joe, don't miss it! Be careful, boys. | Be careful. Throw it out here, | Mr. O'Hare! I haven't thrown a spitball since I was | first line pitcher on the Baltimore Orioles. All right, son! - Get on the other side of the street. | - Okay. There she goes. Ow! Well, he... He didn't hit it. Just sharpening | the blade, that's all. Shut your eyes, please. That tickle? A little in your ear. | But that won't hurt. Ah! Ah! Ah! Okay. It wasn't your fault. | I can fix that. No harm done. | No harm done. Got a mole? - Yeah. I've had it all my life. | - Mm-hmm. Won't have it anymore. You wanna shave | right here. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. | - Ah! Ah! Ah! That's all right. I... Uh, how do you do? Is it true that you can take weight off | in that steam room of yours? I positively | guarantee it. My wife says if I don't get some | of this fat off, she'll leave me. Step right this way, | will you? Right in here. | Here's the room right here. Just go | into this hangar. Change your clothes | in there. If he ever took his shoes off, | he'd go right up in the air. Hey, what's that dog | doing in here? It's a very funny thing. | The other day a man was in here. And I was shaving him. | The razor slipped and I cut his ear off. The dog got it. Ever since he's been | hanging around here for... Go away. Go away. | He can't get another ear. Got to follow through, | the same as you do with a hockey club. I guess my strop | freezes up the moment I... Ah! There you are. Here we are. | Here. See? Steam room. Right in there. | Right in there and sit down. There, there. I'll turn | the steam on right away. Come on, Ethel. | Get excited. There you are. Now, don't stay in there | over a minute. If it gets too hot, just press | that button and the light will go on. If you get into any trouble, | just pull that rope... and the horn | will blow up there, and I'll get you | right out. He's in there a minute, | it'll take a ton off. Just one little hot towel, | and you'll be like new again. All right. | All right. All right. All right. All right. - All right. | - Oh! All right. There you are. The police car. | I bet they're after that bandit. Which way did they go? | They went up that way. When I hear that old siren, | I feel like an old horse. Wanna get back | in the harness again. - I used to be a detective once. | - Really, Mr. O'Hare? - Yes, yes. | - You seem to have been everything. - Well, I guess I was. My wife calls me every... | - Cornelius! Yes, yes, my | will-o'- the-wisp? - Did you mail that letter I gave you yesterday morning? | - Uh... Uh... Uh, yeah... Yes. - Yes, I did, dear. | - I think I'll go have my dress fitted. Yes, have your dress | fitted, yes. - How do you do, Mrs. Broadbutter? | - How do you do, Mr. O'Hare? Would you mind taking care of the baby | while I go in the drugstore? - I'd love to. | - Thank you. - How's Mr. Broadbutter? | - Fine. I'll be just a minute. Okay. Here. What's this? | Come here. Come here. My little wooly britches. Don't you | know to swallow that will kill you? I'll get it. Here she is. Oh! Wouldn't you like to wait | for a little powder? I'd like to have enough powder | to blow you up, if you wanna know. Have you had enough? Have I had enough? Ah, been biting | your nails again, eh? If I had | my former weight, I'd choke you to death. I'll sue you... and take this barbershop | away from you. Oh, well, | I don't care. And I just got this | nice new steam room put in too. I'll have the law | on you for this. Well, I told you | not to stay in over a minute. - Did you have a nice lunch? | - Cornelius? - Ah, yes, my slendery? | - I'm going downtown. - I need clothes. Give me some money. | - You got change for a dollar? Give it to me. I think | I'll have my nails manicured too... while I'm out. - Pop, you wanna hear another riddle? | - Not now, Ronald. Run along. | Run along, son. Play your | little baseball. O'Hare? If you think you've heard | the last of this, you're mistaken. - You deliberately locked me in that room. | - Why, that's a colossal fib. I'm a very | kindhearted person. I've never hurt man, | beast or child. Except when I had to. Well, Lena, | let's get going. I'm glad you like this. - How do you do? | - Oh, howdy do? Howdy do? - I'd like to have my little girl's hair cut. | - Oh, surely. She's a very pretty little girl. | I'd love to cut her hair. - And she knows where to go, doesn't she? | - Yes, she does indeed. - It's a very pretty hat she has on. | - She's been to a maypole dance. - Has she? | - Yes. - Want your hair cut? | - No. - Gloria. | - Oh, have your hair cut. I'll just take her hat off. - Do you mind? | - I don't want my hat off. I'll have it off. - You can't wear a hat when you're having your hair cut. | - No indeed. There's two hats. - Maybe she better keep her hat on. | - It might not be bad. Now, look here, | there's a nice stick of candy for you. - Aren't you ashamed? | That's the barbershop candy. - I've got plenty of it. | - You think they were really chasing the bandit? Sure it was. For two pins, I'd close | this shop and go over and get him... and choke him to death | with my bare hands. That's the way we used to choke wolves | to death years ago in the northwest. I belong to the Bare Hand | Wolf Chokers Association. Had to choke a wolf to death | before you could belong to the asso... Um, yes, sir, | yes, sir, yes, sir? Listen, barber, get rid of those people | and get rid of them quick. - I'm sorry, folks. This gentleman is ahead of you. | - That's absurd. - After I've waited here this length of time. | - He telephoned in... - He telegraphed... | - What's the matter with you? - He was here. He came... | - You act like an idiot. Come on, Gloria. | We'll get out of this place. - Think I'll go upstairs. | - Stay where you are. Listen, barber, you've got ten minutes | to make me look like another man. - Yes, sir. | - I gotta get out of this town fast. Get that thing off there. | Come on. Make it snappy. - I think I'll go home, Mr. O'Hare. | - Stay where you are. Listen, barber, get this. | Take the mustache off. Take the tabs off. Take the eyebrows | off. Close-crop the hair. - And make it snappy. | - Have you tried that good barber at the hotel? - He's wonderful. | - Get busy. I'm the worst barber in town. | My wife will tell you that. - Will you take those off? | - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. What are you doing? Are you gonna | get going, or are you gonna get going? - I'm gonna get going. | Lock the door, Miss Sharp. Gangway, please! | Excuse me. Stop in the name | of the law! Stop | in the name of the law! Get out of the way, you fools! | You wanna get killed? Wretched bicycle! I didn't mean it! Get out of the way, you fools! | I didn't mean it. Let me up. Let me up. | I didn't try to get ya. I like bandits. | Some of my best friends are bandits. The president of the bank | comes up to our house. - Congratulations, Mr. O'Hare. | - Yeah? You get the $2,000 reward. This is | the fella we've been looking for. - I told ya I'd get him, didn't I? | - What's the matter here? - What happened? | - I caught the bandit. - You caught him? | - Yeah, I get the $2,000 reward. I had to chase him | around the block three times... before I got the revolver | away from him. - I don't believe my own ears. | - One side, folks. Just a minute. Here's the brave little lad | that captured the bandit. He hit a liner with a baseball that | struck him right on the top of his head. He knocked poor Mr. O'Hare here | right off his bicycle. - Are you hurt, Mr. O'Hare? | - Not physically, no. - Come on, Dick. Get these folks out of here. | - All right. Come on, you. That's a brave | little lad, Ronald. In regards to the reward, Mr. O'Hare, | step over to the station tomorrow. I'll see that | you get it. So, you caught | the burglar. Come, Ronald. - Pop, you wanna hear another riddle? | - Not now, Ronald. I'm not in the mood. - Go upstairs and eat your spinach. | - Never mind, Mr. O'Hare. - I know you caught the bandit. | - I know I caught him too. What's the good of arguing with | those people? They're all nervous. You can't talk | to 'em at all. Come on, Lena. | Let's talk to her. Lena! Little devils. | You're just as lively as can be too. Lena, how could you? You dog, you.
