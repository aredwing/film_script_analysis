All characters are made to talk in Telugu.. ..so that everybody can understand them. You were proud that Kolkata is in your power. Today Kolkata is under my control. Call out for your leader. Say, Brother, Taxi Seth is going to kill us. Please come and save us. Call out for him. Where is your leader? Shout for help! We don't have to shout. Goddess Kali will save Kolkata. Our leader will save us. He'll come. He'll come? How will he come? When will he come? He's not a bus or a train to tell his arrival timings. He's a storm. Hey! Nothing will be left here when our leader arrives. I'm telling this for your own welfare. Pack all your bags and run if you know running. If you can't run, hide yourself. You don't have much time. He'll be here. Beat him up! I'll forgive you if you try to harm me. But I'll kill you if you try to harm my friends. How did this happen? Who killed so many people? What were you doing when they were getting killed? Our sir will answer your questions. Yes. Okay. I'll arrange for the tickets but won't come for the movie. Listen! I'm already seeing a 70 mm movie here. Okay? Sir! What? The press.. Will you hang up for a second? What is it? The press is attacking us with questions. What should we tell them? What will you tell them that they don't know? They'll ask Is the police department sleeping? Why didn't you catch the killers yet? We'll tell them that we are in the process of doing that. They'll abuse us and we'll speak morals. All of that is just a routine. Send the bodies for post mortem. Okay, sir. What is it, Gajalaxmi? The minister looks very upset. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir! Looking at the crime scene we understood.. ..that your brother had tied some men to a pole. Either one of them or another man killed all your men. Some were stabbed, others' bones were shattered. I think your brother died because.. ..there was a lot of bleeding from his nose and mouth. Do you get paid to cover the story like a TV reporter? Sir.. I don't want to know how my brother died. I want to know who killed him. Catch him wherever he is. I've to kill him with my hands. Catch him! Catch him! Is it a running bus so that we can run and catch it? What does he think? Can I tell when and why I'll get calls on my phone? How is that possible, sir? You'll know it after you get the call. In the same way, the police get to know after the killings. Hi, sir! Good morning! Good morning! Here are the post mortem reports of all the bodies. The killer is a very strong man. I think he is a young man under 25 years of age. He smashed all the bones in all the bodies. Even their skulls are broken. How can we catch this strong 25 year old young man.. ..with just these evidences in millions of people? How can I tell you more than this? I'm sorry. I'll catch him. I'll find him no matter which state or which street he is in. Where are you? O my dear Laila! Come to me O my dear Laila! Come to me, My darling! I am crazy after you Shall I attack straight into your heart Shall I burn inside you like a tequila My dear girls, shall I come to you with my vigor Shall I salute you with my style and make you happy O my dear Laila! Come to me O my dear Laila! Come to me, My darling! I am crazy after you Poland, Finland and China.. Russia and England.. I have my fans all over My hand's touch is mesmerizing Shall I jump into the arena with my energy Shall I see my Mumtaz in you Shall I become the emperor Shahjahan out of intoxication My dear girls, shall I come to you with my vigor Shall I salute you with my style and make you happy O gorgeous girl! What is life without spice O lovely girl, life is insipid without your company I am crazy for love.. My beloved, come to me soon We'll live the full life today Boredom in life is as good as death Show your might to the world Shall I make my heart like a chalise And fill it to the brim with the wine of joy Shall I make every event one to rejoice My dear girls, shall I come to you with my vigor Shall I salute you with my style and make you happy O my dear Laila! Come to me O my dear Laila! Come to me, My darling! Is Cherry still asleep? Of course. He goes around the city all night. He comes home in the wee hours and goes to sleep. Cherry! Wake up. What is it, mom? I kept your coffee here. Get up and get dressed. You will get late. Come on, get up. Okay. Aunty! What? I missed my college bus. My mom told me to ask Cherry for a ride to college. Jimmy! What else did your mom tell you? She told me a lot of things. Tell me a few things. She told me to give you whatever you ask for. Really? After getting onto the bike, she told me to.. ..hold you tightly whenever speed breakers come. What else? I feel shy. I feel irritated. I'm not a fool to fall for your mom's plans. I'm Cherry. Now go. Cherry! Please go. What are you reading so intently, Saraswati? I'm trying to learn English. What does brutal mean? Utmost cruelty. Say it in Telugu, sir. You need to learn Telugu along with English. Yes. Why are you reading this stupid news now? Go and finish your work. Mom, breakfast. Serve it quickly. Instead of being in such a hurry all the time.. ..why don't you get up early and get dressed? Your uncle is your CEO. Can't you call him up and say that you'll be late today? I've been trying to do that. But he's not answering my call. Did he forget his phone upstairs? He hasn't come down since morning. Really? Uncle! What's the matter, uncle? Why did you cover yourself like that? Are you cold? I'm scared. What? If they ask for me at office, say I'm out of town. If they are not satisfied, say that I'm dead. Why should I lie to them? Because you can't tell them the truth. What is that truth? Tell me. I was happily going to the office in my company car. I suddenly got a phone call. Hello! Hello, sir! My sister liked your photo at the marriage bureau. Please meet her once. If you like her, we'll proceed. Okay! She liked me! Yeah! I've been desperately trying to get married. So that news was like water in a desert for me. I thought my life will take a new turn. I took a U turn and went to see the girl. Spit out the betel leaves. Put those knives aside. Change your language and body language. He shouldn't find out that we are goons. Okay. The groom is a software engineer. We should be soft. Okay? - Yes. Look at his lovely hair style. Curly hair. He looks like Shoban Babu, doesn't he? I'm sure he looks even more handsome in person. You said the groom is going to come. Why did he send his father? Hello, sir. Didn't you bring him along? Who? Chandra Babu or Mohan Babu? I was talking about your.. My father died long ago. I didn't mean your father. Stop asking questions and show me the girl. Oh dear! She looks too young. I'll go ahead with her. Take his blessings. No need for that. Sit down. I like the girl. That means he'll like her as well. Who is that? What are you talking about? I like you. You can talk to me in private if you want. A girl talks to the groom in private. How can she talk to the groom's father in private? You misunderstood me. I'm the groom. I want to get married. Then whose photo is this? That's my photo. Disgusting! Dear! Viju! Wait! Dear! You gave your teenage photo at the bureau. But you came to see the girl in your old age. I'm a little late, so what? Not a little late, you are lifetime late. Why are you making it a big issue? For example, who's the hero in the movie 'Khaidi'? Chiranjeevi. What about 'Tagore'? Chiranjeevi. Did his fans increase or decrease? They've increased. People who liked Chiranjeevi in 'Khaidi' 20 years ago.. ..like him in 'Tagore' today, don't they? Yes. If you liked my old photo, why don't you like me now? Fans and marriage are two different things. No, they are the same. Do we stop seeing Taj Mahal and Charminar.. ..because they are old now? Why don't you speak? We don't. - This is the same. Nobody stops getting married because they've grown old. I can't wait anymore. Let's fix a wedding date. What did you say? Wait! If you think of beating me up.. ..even I can arrange for you to get beaten up. Do you know Babji in this city? Do you know him? If I make a phone call, he'll come and beat you up. Listen to me! Nobody can stop this wedding. Hey, Boss is Babji's right hand. We hid our weapons since you are a software man. Boss, shall we kill him? Wait! I understood the matter clearly now. If we fight inside, all your furniture will break. If you want to fight, come to Gymkhana Grounds. Hey! I'm just one man. You are twenty men. Bring another twenty men. Make it twenty twenties. You can bring more men but don't bring fewer men. Run! Hey! I infuriated them and ran away with fear. Those angry men couldn't catch me. But they have my phone number. They are messaging me all the abuses in Telugu. They are even threatening to kill me. You did all this behind my back? Is it not wrong to show your teenage photo and.. ..go to see the girl in old age? I did a bigger mistake than that. What is that? I used Babji's name. If he finds out about this matter, he'll surely kill me. You are scared of Babji, aren't you? - Yes. Let's go to his house. - No! We shouldn't touch fire or mess with a hoodlum. I will mess with him for you. Let's go. Hi, man! Whom do you want? Babji. Boss is busy in a settlement. Wait outside. Okay. We ourselves are hoodlums. How dare you occupy our land? I will kill you if you touch my name or my property. Uncle.. What is it? Look at that girl. You should have devotion in a temple.. ..and fear in a goon's house. Why are you seeing a girl in his house? Turn your head. She's beautiful, uncle. - No! She looks as if she's made for me. Listen.. Uncle, if I hook up with this girl.. ..we don't have to come here for any settlements.. ..they themselves will come to us. How is the idea? You'll get into deep trouble. We came here to clear a problem, not to create it. I don't want this settlement. I'm going home. Turn your face this side, please. Hey! The boss called you inside. Nephew, we got a visual of his cruelty. It's better to leave from here. I'm with you. Let's go inside. Hello, sir! Boss, this is the man that came to see my sister. Not me, it was my uncle. He looks good. Why don't you get her married to him? Not this one, boss. It's the one that is hiding behind. Hello, sir. What nonsense! Why do you want to get married.. ..at an age where you should get others married? Not just age, everything is more in him. He is using boss's name like a credit card. He threatened me that he'll get me beaten up.. ..by giving a call to our boss. How dare you threaten my men.. ..by using my nephew's name? What is your name? 'Jalebi' (Sweetmeat)! 'Jalebi'? What kind of a name is that? I've never heard it before. My dad had a sweet shop. His specialty was 'Jalebi.' I'm special in my family, so they named me that. Jalebi! Is that so? What is your name? Cherry! Cherry? Is there a story behind your name as well? Just Cherry, it's a nickname. His name is a sweetmeat and your name is a fruit. Does that give you license to use others' names? Teach them a lesson. Wait! Don't the people of Hyderabad.. ..have a right to use Babji sir's name? People are crazy about him. He has love for his people. So, he used his name. Is that wrong? What was my question and what is your answer? What are you talking about? I didn't understand a thing you said. It's enough if he understands it. Babji sir's name is as famous as 'Biryani' in Hyderabad. We used Babji sir's name to get a seat in the convent. We used Babji sir's name to get a seat in the college. Just as people of Hyderabad need water from Gandipet.. ..they need Babji sir's name. What do you say, uncle? Are you flattering him? Uncle! - What? Let him speak. Go ahead. You tell me. They stand beside you but don't know.. ..the power you have in the public. Power Star Pawan Kalyan movie. First day, first show. Will any of them get a ticket? We won't get. But I will get it because I use Babji sir's name. If you take Babji sir's name.. ..the police won't ask for your license.. ..the traffic police won't ask for your RC.. ..they won't ask you money in the bunk. Is it wrong to use such a powerful person's name? What is your point? Will you use his name everywhere you go? Uncle! What? We'll know what is our value in the market.. ..when we talk to such people every now and then. You are correct, sir. Sir, if you don't mind, can I take a photo with you? Yes. Uncle, click a photo. You just used his name till date. Will you use the photo now? Just wait, sir. Please put your hand on me. Go ahead. Brother, I'm going to the college. Is she your sister? - Yes. Uncle, click a photo with her as well. Hey, what is this new twist? Why do you want a photo with her? Click a photo, uncle. This is not working. Will you click a photo if it starts working? Why do you need a single girl's photo? What's wrong in that? They'll get publicity. They'll print posters and distribute them. Can't you see that they are ruffians? You go to the college, dear. Please go, dear. Sir, which college is she studying in? Why do you want to know that? Why did we come here? What are you asking him? Uncle, if we know which college she studies in.. ..we won't go to that area. If any of my friends go there, I'll warn them.. ..saying that Babji sir's sister is studying in that college. What do you say, sir? Correct. B.Tech final year, Shreya Engineering College. Give him all the details. Pin code, postal address.. ..height, weight, zodiac sign and everything else. Someday he'll come with a good plan. What are you saying? I came here to meet Babji sir. Why do you talk as if I came to flirt with his sister? Shut up! Do you know where you are? Why are you talking about flirting? You are in Babji sir's house. Why are you involving his sister in all this? Stop it! Sir, no matter what they say, I'm a huge fan of yours. It is enough if you understand me. I can understand a man by his words.. ..and his character by his eyes. You are great, sir. You can meet me whenever you want to. Thank you, sir. Just a small request. Please tell them not to harm my uncle. They won't harm him. Thank you, sir. - Go. Bye. Sir, you are super! What happened to your voice, uncle? Did you lose it? Not just my voice, I might lose my life because of you. Why did you want to take a photo with that girl? They will kill you. I don't care what happens. I like that girl. I love her. Do as you wish. Drive carefully. Where are we going? We are going to her college. Hey! Madhu! You've rejected me every time I proposed to you. If you don't say you love me, I'll jump down from here. Will you say it or should I jump? Madhu, don't give him time to think. Say you love him. Otherwise he'll jump. He'll jump just one time. The TV people will show it hundred times.. ..and shut down the college. But the TV people are not here. We don't need TVs and cameras, dear. Everyone has cell phones. The students are already shooting it. Madhu! Say it, dear. What is this, sir? - Wait, sir! Does she have to love everybody.. ..that climbs to the top and threatens her? Listen to me and get down immediately. I'll get down if she says that she loves me. Madhu, there's no time. Say that you love me. Don't think, otherwise I'll jump. He is someone crazier than you. Nobody is crazier than me. Madhu, will you say it or should I jump? Say it, dear. If he really jumps down.. ..you'll go to prison and I'll go to the court. Madhu! Why did he climb higher than that fellow? Madhu, I'll jump down if you say that you love him. That boy is not from our college, sir. But he climbed up in our college. Who are you? It doesn't matter who I am. Only what I want matters. Madhu should not say that she loves him. I've seen people jumping demanding to be loved. But he is demanding a refusal. He is a weirdo. What will you do now, dear? If you say yes to one, the other man will jump. Don't worry, dear. Please don't make her nervous. Decide which one will jump and which one will stay. What is this, brother? I put in the tender but you're trying to take the contract. Why are you ruining my efforts? Why are you putting in efforts? It's useless to try and call a phone that's switched off. Stop overacting and get down, I'll tell you a truth. What is that truth? I'll tell you if you get down. Okay. He got down. He put some magic spell on him. What is that truth? You can threaten anybody for your love. But you shouldn't threaten the one you love. That girl is mine, so go your way. What? Is this the truth you wanted to tell me? Brother, you don't know her brother Babji. He is a murderer. You can't win with him, you'll die. How will you win with him? He himself can't win with me. Why is that? You concentrate on your studies. You'll understand all this later. Hey! Where are you going? I'm going to meet Madhu. Why do you want to meet Madhu? I'm holding my heart tight so that it doesn't stop beating. Come, let's go home. Come with me, uncle. Where are you taking me? You handled the situation very well. - Thank you. Thanks, son. Bye, son. - Okay, sir. Thanks a lot. Will you just thank me for taking such a big risk? What else will she say? What else will Babji sir's sister say? Let's go. Wait a minute, uncle. If you don't mind.. I think I love you. Hey! Why are you walking away? I'll tell it to my brother. God, please save us. Why do you never get worried? What will you get by worrying? You will die. Okay, let's go. Babji! Babji! Did you see what that rascal did? He went up to the tenth floor and threatened.. ..that he'll jump down if our girl didn't say she loves him. No, uncle. Whatever it is, did he do it or not? He used your name behind your back all this while. Now he is using your family. If we leave him, tomorrow he'll demand.. ..that she should get married to him. Why are you sitting without saying a word? Will you get her married to him? Cherry! When did he come? Ask him. Cherry told me what actually happened there. Should I tell them as well, sir? No need. A guy threatened that he'll jump down.. ..if sister doesn't say that she loves him. Cherry risked his life and saved her. Did he save that guy? No, he saved sister. It is not about climbing up and down a building. He harassed her to say that she loves him. If you get an electric shock.. ..l'll hit you with a stick to save your life. Does that mean that I hit him, sir? The whole drama revolved around 'I love you,' sir. By mistake I must've said I love you, sir. Will I ever talk wrongly about you or wrong you? What do you say, uncle? Babji! Don't believe him. He is saying yes with his eyes and no with his lips. Sir, they are jealous that I might become close to you. That's why they are painting a wrong picture about me. And they are even using your beautiful sister for that. How dare you stand before us and.. Shut up! It's up to me whether I believe them or not. I trust you. Thank you for saving my sister. You may go. You are super, sir. Uncle, let's go. Okay. I knew that flattery blinds a person. But he proved that it can break a family too. I'm very angry. Don't utter proverbs before me. I will break all your bones. You said something to him and something else to her. And you said everything to me. They will kill you if they find out. Oh, I won't let them find out. Jalebi! Go! Move! Do your work. Move! Did you call me, dear? I shouted your name. Where is he? I don't know. I cut off his friendship yesterday. It's not enough if you cut it off with him. Tell him to cut it off with me. He should come to me in ten minutes.. ..and say that he doesn't love me. Otherwise I will get you killed. Yeah! Sir, why are you happy after being abused by her? I expected a tsunami, but it was a simple cyclone. Go. Thank God! Now I know that this girl doesn't love him. If I make him say the same, I'll get rid of this nuisance. It was so much fun. Excuse me. - Yeah. It's not good for a girl that drinks cold coffee.. ..to take such hot decisions. Who are you? What are you talking about? Even though I'm facing you, this topic is hers. If the topic is hers, why don't you tell it to her? I'm afraid to tell it to her face. I might love her again. Cherry! What did you come here for? And what are you saying now? Okay, I'll say it. Is it wrong if a person that travels in an auto.. ..dreams of driving a car? Not at all. Is it wrong for a handsome guy like me.. ..to fall in love with a slim and trim girl like her? No. Just shut up! Okay. If you want to talk to me, come directly to me. Why are you troubling my bachelor uncle? Please don't create a scene. If you use a credit card with no balance.. ..it will be declined, it won't give you money. Don't scare my uncle who is already scared. I'm dropping out. Goodbye! Thank God! My dear fellow, you'll have a good future. Why did you stop? I'll tell her something and be back. What is it again? - I'll tell you. Excuse me! Hello! You can agree with me if you listen as well. No country thrives if it insults lovers and laborers. A beautiful girl like you should promote love, not break it. When you reject a lover, think why you are rejecting him. Think about it with a cool mind. Bye. Finally, did you leave that girl or not? Will we leave the thread if we lose the kite? Sir, an enquiry based on the detection of sniffer dogs.. ..revealed that some people took a man called Singh.. ..from here just before Taxi Seth was murdered. This is the house, sir. Does this mean that Singh killed all those men, sir? No, that's not possible. How can a few goons kidnap a man.. ..that could brutally kill so many men? Their leader is somebody else. Sir, I found this slip inside. Their next target is Hyderabad. Since he booked a ticket from Kolkata to Hyderabad.. ..the criminal is definitely in Hyderabad. Yes, I reached Hyderabad. Go away. Hello! Don't give money to such people. Do you know about them? They beg for money with a sad face.. ..they finance money with a daily interest of 10 rupees. They do real estate business on city outskirts. They beg in the mornings as a side business. Got it? Did you take some finance from them? No way. These are the general topics at signals. I told you what everybody says. Don't tell everyone what everybody says. Okay. Go. You have high fever. Why are you begging under the hot sun? I need to do this no matter how sick I am. Otherwise they will kill me. Who? - Dasu. Fever? Will you go to Apollo Hospital? You get fever, headache, and cough only if you are alive. You'll get none of these after you die. Boss, please don't kill my son. Show these sentiments while begging. You've to bring 100 rupees a day whether you live or die. Otherwise, you will have no life at all. And he also pulls out the eyes of newborn babies. He is a very good dancer. Since he'll become a great man if he dances well.. ..he chopped off his legs. His men are spread in bus stands and railway stations. They pick up new children that come here.. ..saying that they'll provide work. Once he finds you, you will die but never escape. Why don't you complain to the police? He already killed two people who tried to do that. We are living there in fear not knowing what to do. Where can I find him? Why are you sitting here so leisurely? Are you the ones on night duty? Yes, boss. You eat three times a day but.. ..go for collections just one time a day. Why can't people give notes instead of coins? I have a tough time counting them. Every first day of the month, it feels like.. ..Goddess Laxmi is walking in here. Why live a cheap life with coins? Whether it is Ambani's money or begged money.. ..the market rate is the same. Whether they are coins or notes.. ..they get the same value in the market. Should I tell you something about change? How much will that come to at the end of the month? The calculator can't fit in the whole number. And these bags are not enough to hold all the money. If Dawood lbrahim and Chota Rajan find out the income.. ..in this business, they'll leave their mafia gangs abroad.. ..and start a similar business here. Look at my son. He looks like a hero. How is my dress, dad? I'll spend 100 million rupees and.. ..make a movie with you as the hero. Even if the beggars in the market see it.. ..your movie will run for 100 days. I don't want to be a hero. Songs and fights are boring. I'll become a villain. It will be fun to do rapes and murders. You are already doing that. But everybody will see me if I do it in a movie. Who are you? Why are you beating him? Stop it! He will die! I want him to die. How dare you come to my area and beat my son? It is not climate that changes with the area. It is courage. Can't you bear to see your son getting beaten up? How can others bear to see when your son.. ..tortures their little children? Poisonous flowers. He'll just lose his sight. Please don't harm my child. She'll keep crying. You go ahead. No! I'm warning you! Let my son go! Are you Mother Teresa's heir to save the orphans? Tell him about me. Why do you want to mess with them? They chop off people's hands and legs for coins.. ..and do their business on busy roads. You look like a young guy. Go and chat with girls. Don't get into fights. Hey! Break his bones! Kill him! Hello! Is this the police station? Will you treat humans worse than animals? Are these the fingers that pulled out the eyes.. ..of infants that should play in their mother's laps? Are these the hands that gave begging bowls.. ..to small children instead of school books? Please let him go. All the parts in my brother's body are shaken. All his bones are broken. Please leave him. What are you thinking, sir? There's no other part in his body left except his head. Sir, don't mind that he didn't salute you. Brother is not in a state to lift his hands. I have a small request. - Shut up! He'll live if you take him in an ambulance instead of a jeep. He can at least spend his life in a prison. Congrats for saving all of them by taking such a risk. You should be doing this, not me. We? - Yes, you. You go to see a minister if he's traveling on road. But you totally ignore the small children.. ..that are begging on the same road. For TRP ratings, you'll run SMS contests.. ..whether Aishwarya Rai will have a son or a daughter. You'll give details of gross, share and shake.. ..of a superstar's movie but ignore such children. Media should work for public, not for publicity. Look, stop writing about me. There are many people that do good to the society. There are many people that responded to a newspaper.. ..that stated that a man needs 500,000 for an operation. Inform such people about these people. Think about ways needed to help these people. Please. You are a real hero, brother. We might've heard about liquor mafia or drugs mafia. But human mafia is more dangerous than that. A man shattered that mafia and sincerely responded.. ..to the atrocities being done in the society and.. ..saved hundreds of orphans with great courage. This software young man Cherry is being.. ..congratulated on Facebook, Twitter and through e-mails. I like him now. I'll finalize him. Oh. Why did you stop? I feel shy. You look handsome when you feel shy. Oh.. Why did you come here all of a sudden? Actually Cherry has robbed my peace. He gave a new life to many orphans. I felt he is a good man. You should hook us up. Why are you guys torturing me? Please. Why do you need my mediating, dear? Why don't you talk to him yourself? He is very unpredictable. He might suddenly refuse. I have huge ego. So, please make him come to me. Oh, so you have huge ego. Let me take care of that. You have ego, I have fear, and he has pride. Let's forget about this love now. Jalebi! - Yes, dear. I'm very short-tempered as well. Oh God! I'm stuck! I'll try, dear. Cherry! - Yes? Do you like me? I even left the girl I love for you, uncle. No, please continue loving that girl. Is this an internet connection to cut when you don't want.. ..and connect it back when you want it? It is my heart. Don't give me quotations. Huh? She heard that you saved some orphans. Since then she has decided not to let you go. Come and tell her that you love her. What? Won't she love me if I don't save anyone? I don't want such a girl, uncle. I want someone that likes me just the way I am. Why will someone like you the way you are? Are you Abraham Lincoln or Bill Clinton? Uncle! - Please, I beg of you. Okay. I have a huge ego, so tell her to come to me. Huge ego? Did you hear our conversation? No! Why do you ask? Even she said the same thing. We all are just kids. Why cling to our egos? Come and talk to her. I can't bend lower than this. Go and bring that girl to me. She said she'll kill me. Don't take her seriously. She said she'll kill herself. Don't take her seriously at all. Darn! Why are you crying in the washroom, sir? Do I need your permission to cry here? Won't you let me even cry in peace? Okay, sir. Continue crying. Wash your hands. Cherry will get me into deep trouble. Oh dear! I don't know how many murders this will lead to. I fell in love at first glance of yours I fell for this smile of yours I got snared by just one word.. I am done for I am retracing my steps My strength is all spent I can't eat anything due to your delusion My body is shivering with fever I am overcome with shyness, O god Good lord! Your beauty has set me on fire I fell in love at first sight of you I fell for this smile of yours God has put up some link between you and me That's why my heart is dancing with joy I'll have you as my beloved in the future lives too I like you and offered my heart to you I landed in your lap and seek your protection No! No! No! O god! She has intoxicated me! O lord! I'm reaching for the skies You have come with the speed of light and stole my heart You come to my dreams daily and drown me with kisses I've got a twitching eye looking for you O girl, your lips are a savory sweet You've changed my life.. how did you manage this No! No! No! O god! I feel the coolness of the moonlight O lord! I am sweating in the peak of winter I fell in love at first glance of yours I fell for this smile of yours Cherry is going around with our madam. We need to tell this to boss immediately. It's not sister's fault, boss. Even a twig starts blossoming if you water it every day. Shut up, you fool! He watered our girl, not a twig. He is at fault for giving him that chance. What did you say? You can understand a person from his words.. ..and his character from his eyes, is it? What did you understand? He made a fool of you. Darn! I couldn't hear his flattery for you. When I stopped him, you cut me short saying Uncle! What will you do now? Your sister will say that she wants to get married to him. I've to kill him. Huh? I cannot tolerate betrayal. He should die before sister tells me about her love. That's like my boy. Come on, find him. Should we kill him? Shut up! Boss, he is going around with a helmet. He stopped at Khairatabad signals. What do you want me to do? A helmet saves from accidents, not problems. Follow him. We are starting from here now. Yes, boss. - Where is he? He went down the flyover and took a left turn. Should we ram our jeep into his bike? No! Babji himself will kill him. You follow him. Okay, boss. Boss, he came to State Home. We are nearby. Boss, won't it be risky to kill him here? It is better to kill him there. The news will spread in all the state. Mother! - Yes? Take these 100 rupees and keep this packet with you. I'll come back and get it later. - Okay. Mother! Give me the packet. Here it is. Boss, he went inside. Let's go. - Okay. Babji, this murder should be the highlight of all crimes. Sir, the DGP is in a meeting. You can't go this way. Give our greetings to sir. You know my nephew, don't you? Yes sir. Let's go now. Where is this fellow? Boss, he is there. Go and finish him right there. He shot the DGP in a second. It takes 10 days for us to just say hello to him. The murder is cancelled. We don't know his background. We should leave before he sees us. Turn around. Uncle! My heart is beating fast. I'm in the same condition. Why did our family get involved with him? Is he gone? Will he survive after taking in so many bullets? You fool! I meant the killer, not the dead man. I think he is gone, boss. Thank God! Why did he get such high fever? I can feel the heat here. This is not some viral fever. He got it because of a sudden shock. Did he see any shocking incident from close? Yes, we did see something like that. No medicines will work on him. Just forget it. Forget what? My nephew? No, the incident you saw. DGP was killed right in the State Home. Who killed him amidst so many VIPs? Are they terrorists, gangsters or naxalites? The police are investigating into this case. Babji, we were very lucky. If we went and asked him why he loves our girl.. ..he would've pointed that gun at us. Which gun, sir? What do you have to do with that? We got stuck in a problem because of ill-luck. You leave. Okay, sir. Brother! You were alright in the morning. Why did you get this fever all of a sudden? You are responsible for this. What did I do? You.. I understood. I should behave as if I don't know anything. Go inside. I need to talk to brother. It would be better if you give him some poison and kill him. Can't you see that he has high fever? What do you want to talk now? Go away. Wait, uncle! Today is a very auspicious day. For what? To kill him? Uncle! Brother, I love someone. That's a wonderful thing. He is burning like an electric heater. Is it necessary to give him this news now? Uncle, brother will be happy to know whom I love. He got fever because of that man. Brother, the man I love is a huge fan of yours. Who is that? Cherry? He is a smooth talker. Don't trust him at all. Uncle, you didn't like him from the beginning. Brother will be upset if you talk negatively about him. Darn! Babji, why do we have to endure this torture? Please go, dear. Uncle.. Brother, Cherry is here to meet you. He is here? What is this, sir? I thought you had a strong body. What happened to you? He became like this after seeing something shocking. What did he see? They've killed the DGP who protects the state. He is already suffering with high fever. Why are you showing him such crime news? Was this the shocking thing that you saw? Why will we see that? We didn't see anything. We don't know anything about it. All the fools here are going through a bad week. I think she must've already told you about me. She said you never refused her anything since childhood. I came to you with courage hoping you won't refuse me. I hope you don't have any objection. Is that a yes? Why doesn't he speak? How can we refuse? We agree to it. Smile, Babji. Then he'll believe you. That is a smile. Thanks, brother. I'm very happy. Thank you. You should actually thank me. - Why? Who is responsible for your love? Me! I went to see his sister and use his name. Then I brought you here and you saw this girl. Then this girl liked you and.. Hey! Stop your nonsense. You got what you wanted. Now leave. If you don't mind, I'll take Madhu home.. ..and introduce her to my family. How can he refuse? Take her with you. Wow! You are really great, sir. Please don't flatter me. Take her with you. Bye! Jalebi! Did you call me, sir? - Yes. Cherry, you take her home. I'll give a party to your uncle for hooking you up with her. Okay, sir. Uncle, enjoy. Thank you. Babji sir's sister is going to get married. What about your sister? Why don't you settle for me? Don't give me those serious looks. Now my background is bigger and stronger than you. Plate! Why is the plate so big? Food! Why did you serve me so much food? It will reduce if you start eating. Come on. Can anyone eat so much food? Even he can't eat so much. What is this, sir? Ask them to remove half of it. Jalebi! I feed others with a lot of love. You should finish all that is served in your plate. You should eat whatever I serve you. You should eat it in whatever way I tell you to eat. Otherwise I'll lose my control and kill you. Oh! I think this is a murder scheme. Others beat you to death, but he will feed me to death. Start eating. I will eat. Oh God! My stomach is in pain. I will die! I will get stuck in this! All the parts in the body are filled with food. How did you eat so much food? I didn't eat, sir. They stuffed the food into me. How can they stuff so much? Tell me the real story. Take your hand off. Is this a table to rest your hands? What? Okay, now.. Are you a doctor or a lawyer? Why do you ask questions when I'm dying? It's not like that. Forget that. Operate on me and take the food out. I beg of you. We can operate to get the baby out, not the food. This is the body, sir. We have all the recordings of the CCTV cameras.. ..in the State Home from the day of the murder. Second camera. Second camera. Third camera. Hey, who are they? They are present in all the cameras. A famous rowdy called Babji. And that is his uncle. What is he saying? His voice was not recorded, sir. Is there anyone in the Intelligence Department.. ..that can read his lips and give us the dubbing? We have someone, sir. Who is he? Sir, he is the man you wanted to see from Intelligence. Hello, sir. I think he is a drunkard. Yes, sir. I'm always in mufti and fully intoxicated. Duty and drink are like my two eyes. Do you drink continuously? No, sir. I drink it for courage when I've to arrest someone. After that I drink in fear that he many harm me. I drink with joy when officers like you appreciate me. I drink with sadness if you don't appreciate me. But you have to drink all the time, is it? I strongly feel that everyone in Intelligence.. ..is addicted to some habit. Okay, show him the tapes. Play. Stop. Rewind the tape. Babji, this murder should be the highlight of all crimes. Great! Great sync. You've synced the lips perfectly. CBI's duty is to link or sync something, sir. Bring them to my office. Okay, sir. Will you go alone or will you take support? You should take friends to a wine shop. But you should go alone to the criminals. Am I correct, sir? You are correct. I like you. I too, sir. - Go ahead. I'm afraid to think about the future, uncle. We can't achieve anything by being afraid or sad. The remote is in his hands. We should watch whatever channel he plays. We can do nothing about it. Hi! His house is better than the Mansion House. Who are you? What are you looking at? I'm thinking of how to reveal the matter. We are not doing anymore settlements. Leave. Why are not you doing them? Should I give you a reason? My son is not well. Why is he not well? Why are you drinking in my house? Are you out of your mind? A vehicle needs petrol to run. My mouth needs a drink to talk. He is acting too smart. Finish him. Wait! I'm a CBI agent that came to interrogate.. ..about the man you already finished. My officer is waiting in the office, let's go. We never go to the station when the police call us. Will we come now for the CBI? We won't come anywhere. Just leave. I'm not a policeman to leave when you ask me to. I'm from CBI. Central Bureau of Investigation. Our Head Office is in Delhi, not your street. If you don't come with me, you'll be in deep trouble. Come on. Go ahead. We'll follow you. Hello! - Hello! So, what do you do? We do small settlements, sir. You fool! Shut your mouth! We do small settlements, sir. What do you mean? We deal with land and family matters of poor people. When a couple has disputes and decide to separate.. ..we say, the relationship between wife and husband.. ..should be like fish and water.. ..not like fish and fisherman and unite them. Why did you go to State Home on 21st? State Home? What is that? We don't know where it is. Since our Babji was ill, we were at home. We haven't stepped out for over a week. False. That's a lie. Tell me the truth. Why will we lie? What are you talking about? Even we have a circle of friends. We know ministers and MLAs. Don't underestimate us. So, did you go to meet them? Where did we go? Whom did we meet? What are you asking about? What were you saying there? I said, Today is Friday, let's go to the temple, Babji. The murder took place on a Tuesday. Darn! How can I remember if it was a Friday or Tuesday? Do you think we committed that murder? Since I'm an old man, I was telling him some good things. Why are you making a big issue out of it? Oh! Good things, is it? Babji, this murder should be the highlight of all crimes. There's something wrong with those dialogues. That's right. I said those words. Why should I lie? I said that dialogue. I said those words in that situation. What was that situation? Some guy trapped our girl. We got information that he was there.. ..and so we went there to warn him. But before that, the matter got twisted like this. So, the murderer is the guy who trapped your girl? Please don't drag us into this issue. Was he there when the murder took place? Yes. Oh no, I don't know. Please don't ask us about him. My boy has fever. I have chest pain. And I have blood. Don't mind that. Sir hit you. You may leave now. Is that all? We can go? CBI is very simple. Let's go. Hey! What is the name of the guy who loves your girl? Charan! His nickname is Cherry. What does he do? He's a software engineer. In which company? What is it? CG Tricks. Madhapur, Phase-2. You may leave now. Sir, why did you let those criminals go? You shouldn't save the bottle after the drink is finished.. ..and the witnesses after the matter is finished. They witnessed the murder, but that man committed it. Am I correct, sir? How can you be so sure? They had fear in their eyes and tremor in their voices.. ..when you mentioned him. I noticed that you noticed that. You are right. You are drunk but your mind works well. Thanks for your compliment. Then let's arrest than man, sir. Sir should say that, not you. He is not killing ordinary men. He completed his target even in the midst of.. ..so many ministers, MLAs and security guards. Looking at his dedication, determination and.. ..decision power, I can't understand.. ..if he is one man or hundred thousand men. We need strong evidences to arrest him. Based on the details they gave us.. ..get me his whole bio-data. Sir! - Yes? We've got all the date of CG Tricks. See Charan's details in the staff list. See if he went to work on the day of murder, the 21st. He was on leave, sir. Yes! Match this photo with CCTV cameras in State Home. We didn't find a match there, sir. Most brilliant criminal. He made sure he wasn't captured in any camera. But I saw him in TV once, sir. When? He exposed a human mafia last month. The people who got beaten up by him.. ..and got arrested are in the prison now. Bring them here. Get down, brother. Be careful. Be careful. Why are you in such a hurry? Be careful. Hello, sir! When you walk, why does it sound like a robot walking? Did you hear the sound of iron rods, sir? Yes. Except for liver, heart and kidneys.. ..everything else is made of steel in their bodies. What do you mean? A guy beat them up and powdered their bones. Since they couldn't be attached together.. ..we managed to put them together with steel rods. His mashed up all the bones in their bodies. Even this is steel, sir. Even their skulls were broken. Was he the one that beat you? It's him! It's him! His photo is dislocating all the rods in their bodies. Please turn that around, sir. He turned it, brother. Didn't you try to take revenge on him? Will we hit the transformer if we get an electric shock? They have intelligence but no information, sir. We don't need any more information. He is the one that we are searching for. Hello, sir! CBI! Did you catch him or not? I've got Intelligence reports that.. ..he is going to kill me in the Kumbh Fair. What are you guys doing? He can't kill you, sir. When you return from Kumbh Fair.. ..he'll be standing before you in handcuffs. You can go there boldly, sir. Go and search! This side. Search everywhere. Go upstairs. This way. Don't leave any room. Search everywhere. What is this commotion? What are you guys doing here? Who do you think lives here? Babji's brother-in-law. We are searching for him. We are from CBI. Who are you? I'm Cherry's uncle. My name is Jalebi. Jalebi? Yes. Unfortunately, my name is Jalebi. You should've named yourself Spicy Chips. They go well with drinks. We searched everywhere, sir. He is not here. Whom are you searching for? Cherry. Where is he? He went to the Khumb Fair. Khumb Fair? Let's go. Pick him. Sir, I have a tummy upset. Did you get him? No, sir. His phone is continuously engaged. I think he is talking to his girlfriend. Keep trying. O my god! Feel the way I feel.. fill me up with love O damsel.. you cut through like a knife Don't shine like the lightning and send shivers down my spine O damsel.. you cut through like a knife Come down like the thunder and give what I seek I am getting intoxicated I am being driven mad This rashness of yours is causing all this I want to share this love and offer you my beauty Why can't you be more patient Madam! Madam! Just be my madam I love you, love you, madam My love is true Let's seal this pact, my love O damsel.. you cut through like a knife Come down like the thunder and give what I seek I saw the dreams of a happy home and immense love I felt shy seeing all that and left it to providence I keep smiling in spite of the burden on my heart Come to me, my love Come to me, my protector Come to me without any delay I come to satisfy your wish.. not necessarily what you asked One must be given that which can't be asked Madam! Madam! Just be my madam I love you, love you, madam My love is true Let's seal this pact, my love O damsel.. you cut through like a knife Don't shine like the lightning and send shivers down my spine O damsel.. you cut through like a knife Don't just walk away like that Give me what I seek Come to me, the greatest lover of the world Come to me, the greatest worker of the world Come to me and don't let this chase go begging Sir, I've seen Khumb Fair in TV, but never in person. Why did you spend so much to give me a free trip? I'll tell you. First call up your nephew. Okay, sir. May God fulfill all your desires! Yes, uncle. Where are you? Put on the speaker. I'm in the Khumb Fair. Even I'm in the fair. When did you come here? I'll tell that later. First tell me where you are. I'm at Lord Shiva's temple. We got him. Freeze! Are you removing your gun out? Should I be quiet when you kill everyone before me? Sir, my son is a software engineer. How can he kill somebody? You'll understand everything in the interrogation. They caught our brother. What now? He is not our brother. No? Then where is our brother? Let's go to the vehicle. Brother will finish him and come. Sir, let's go to the hospital please. I thought he was dead, but he's still alive. He killed my brother and DGP. I should kill him! Hey! Sir, as per rules, we shouldn't fire weapons in Khumb Fair. Forget the rules. Take him to the hospital. I'm really sorry. Since you both look the same.. ..I unnecessarily doubted you. You are not connected to this. You may leave. Sir, who is that man? Why do you want to know about a murderer? Let's go. Wait a minute, uncle. We are at the railway station because they caught him. Otherwise we would've been in the police station. Sunrise and sunset look the same.. ..but the temperatures differ. In a similar way, you are so different from him. Just a minute. Why are you touching that man? It says that he is a hero. The media writes anything they want for circulation. Everyone tries to get rid of their problems. But you are trying to get into one. I want to know about the man that looks like me. Rawat! Down! Down! Rawat! Down! Down! Rawat! Down! Down! Save our lives! Rawat! Down! Down! Save our lives! Rawat! Down! Down! Save our lives! You ask us to shut down factories. But the government asks us to build factories. What should we do now? The government asked you to manufacture medicines.. ..not drugs like 'charas' and heroine. Because of the illegal drugs manufactured by you.. ..the air and water are getting polluted.. ..and people are dying of failed lungs. Understand our problem and shut down the factory. The factory is not polluting the environment. Your illegal slums are polluting it. Go and dwell somewhere else. Go! We won't move! Move your factory! It is not some toy to move it around. It is a factory built with 10 billion rupees. People's lives are more important than money. Badvel! Yes, brother! If one man gets a scolding, If one man gets beaten up, If one man gets killed, Kill him! Oh God! Grandpa! There's no pollution in heaven. Would you like to join him there? Nobody that talks against me or acts against me.. ..should step into Kolkata. He's coming from hostel after a long time. See properly. I'm seeing properly. Don't eat my brains. Oh dear! Siddhu is there! Where? - There! Sister! - Siddhu! Hi, sis! - How are you? I'm good. Hi, Siddhu! - Hi! How are you? Did you prepare well for the exams? I did what I could. Don't make him talk too much. I took an off from the hospital and came to meet him. How can you ask me not to talk to him? You shouldn't talk to him. That's all. He was silent when he wrote his 10 standard exams. So, he came first in the state. If he remains silent even now.. ..he'll come first in central railway exams too. I have a strong mind, sis. Even if I scream around.. ..not a single word will be deleted from my mind. Whatever it is, you will not talk. That's it. Hello! What is this? How can she tell you not to talk? We'll continue talking in secret. Shall we go? Shouldn't we get a coolie? Why? My husband will carry the bags. If you don't talk as your sister said.. ..everyone will think you are dumb. Sis, let me talk a little. Okay. Take a shower and freshen up. I'll cook food. Thanks. Cousin Siddhu! When did you come? What are you looking at? Why are you so stunned? Say something. Put on some clothes or close the door. Everything I studied is going out of my mind. Is that so? Now everything will come back. Only half came back. If he writes this exam and becomes.. ..a railway superintendent, he'll be settled in life. Since he has nobody else except for us.. ..we'll get him married and fulfill our responsibility. Why don't you get him married to my sister? Your sister is superfast and my brother is dead slow. How will they manage? He'll sit in a corner like me. What did you say? I said they'll be happy like us. Hmm. My husband went around the whole of Kolkata.. ..and brought your favorite fish. Thanks. Hi! Didn't you recognize her? She's my sister. Oh! I saw her just once in your wedding. 'I'm glad he didn't say that he saw me without clothes.' She attended the campus interviews recently. She is waiting for the results. Is that so? 'Wow, you are a good actor.' Sit down. It's okay. Please sit down. She doesn't look like the girls of this generation. I think she is a quiet girl. Not at all. She is shy as she met you just now. 'Shy? This girl?' Badvel murdered another man. Muslim brother Riyaz was brutally killed.. ..for demanding to stop the pollution from the factory. Whenever there's a murder or crime in the city.. ..the names connected with that crime are.. ..Rawat and his brothers Badvel and Taxi Seth. But their crimes are never proved. The public and the police know who killed him. Don't the media know? What will you do if we tell you? You'll telecast it till they kill us, right? Who is this Rawat, sis? They've been telling about him from so long. They are rascals. Kolkata hears about them almost every day. That's why we are planning for a transfer.. ..so that we can get away from all these things. Don't the police do anything? There are no police that can arrest them.. ..or men that can confront them in Kolkata. Those goons are doing what they want.. ..because nobody is ready to fight against them. If someone confronts them, they'll get scared. Why should we discuss about them? Forget it. Yes, we shouldn't discuss what happens around us. No matter what happens to others.. ..we should be happy, right? This is not our state or our city. Forget it. Even Mother Teresa wasn't from Kolkata. She came to another country to serve others.. ..and inspired millions of people. These goons are walking in the Kolkata that she lived in. Someone should confront them one day or the other. Oh dear, finish your food. Listen.. - Brother! Close the case immediately. Sir, they are taking Rawat and Badvel's name. Will they take our names instead? Change them in the FIR. Hello, Rawat sir! Bless me! Come in. Greetings! Bless me! Hello! You are my follower and partner. Sit here. No, sir. I'll gain confidence when I sit at your feet. He always does overacting. I heard you were called to Delhi. You take care of the center from now. Your brother will take care of the state. Why two politicians in one family? You are correct. The government always says.. ..that one is enough and two are a crowd in a family. That is about children, not about movies or politics. Here, the more people the more benefit. Am I right, brother? What about the liquor tender? The minister refused to give us the contract saying.. ..there are enough liquor shops for people to drink.. ..and anymore shops will bring his government down. Yes, sir. That minister is a useless man. He is always concerned about the people Correct. When we occupied some land illegally.. ..he created more fuss than the people themselves. You've helped him win and become a minister.. ..thinking that he'll be useful to us.. ..but he has kept my promotion still pending, sir. Call him up! Hello, Rawat sir! I understood the matter.. ..as soon as I got a call from you. I think all your men instigated you against me. Don't act too smart because you have a post.. ..and gunmen besides you. I'll make your gunmen shoot you. You should apply henna only to your fingers. You shouldn't apply it to your body because it gives color. Try to understand. You and your brother killed a man before 10,000 people. Not just me, even my men are trying hard to manage it. And talking about your men, they created.. ..false land documents for Mother Teresa's lands. He put his mother's name and he his grandma's name. Will the people keep silent? Why won't they be silent? Is Mother Teresa still alive? No, she is not. Why do dead people need land? So, I put my mother's name on it. Is that wrong? Shut up! If you say those words in the assembly.. ..the opposition party will abuse you. So what? - Stop. You shouldn't think of people when you are in power. You should think about our men. But that's not.. When I come back from Delhi.. ..I should see him as the DGP.. ..and these men should be happy. Understood? Siddhu! Let's go to a movie. Why a movie now? I already told them to book the tickets. They'll feel bad if we don't go. Who? My fans. Fans? - Yes. Your fans? - Yes. Who are they? Venu and party. You don't know the kind of following I have. Let me show you. Come. Hail Gabbar Singh! Hail Oscar! Brother! - Yes? You are the president of.. ..Kolkata Power Star Fans Association. You should display power. Why are you so scared? I'm not scared. Just a little shivering. Why? Nandini always used to call me for.. ..pizzas, burgers and cold drinks. Today she called me for two side by side movie tickets. What does that mean? Does she like me? Of course she likes you. Why are you tense? If she has asked you to book two side by side tickets.. ..she has given you the signal for love. Really? Take this ring. Wow! Just like people in Andhra are crazy for Power Star.. ..people here are crazy for you, brother. Really? Take this. You are super, brother. Catch this. She fell for you, brother. You are a Bengal Tiger, brother. - Really? You are Siddhu Siddharth Roy, brother. Really? You deserve this chain. Brother, you are giving away all your gold. I hope you don't become a pauper. When 50 kilos of gold is going to be mine.. ..why should I bother about 250 grams of gold? You are right. Hi! - Hi! Brother, your future wife looks beautiful. She does. But who is the man beside her? He is like a Power Star with Mega Star's features. Give me back my ring. - Why? Give it back. - Take. It doesn't matter who he is, brother. He is a VCD, but you are a DVD. You take this. - Thanks. Hi, Venu! - Hi, Nandini! Who is he? My sister-in-law's brother. Brother? I was tense. I'm Venu, local Power Star. Huh? - Yes. Listen! - Yes? Take the brother and buy whatever he wants. Give him whatever seat he wants to see the movie. She and I will sit in the corner seat and.. How can that be possible? No way! Why? He is my sister-in-law's brother. I forced him to come to the movie. If I don't sit beside him, not only him.. ..but my brother and sister-in-law also will feel bad. Let's go, Siddhu. Why does she need corner seats to sit with a brother? She said he is her sister-in-law's brother. What does that mean? He can be her boyfriend too. - What? It is like he is riding your horse. I won't let him ride it. Let's go. Hey, see what the brother is doing? Your girl is doing a lot of things. What is he doing when she's doing all that? Even he'll do something without being seen. If they are behaving like this in a matinee show.. ..they would've done a lot more in a first show. I won't let them do anything. Shall we finish him then? If we do it now, the fans will get disturbed. We'll leisurely finish him in the interval. We need weapons to save our girl or property. So, I brought acid and knife. When I stab him with this knife.. ..you pour acid on his face. What should we do? Watch the show without getting scared. One Popcorn, one Coke, medium French Fries. Where is he? He is there. He is like a free customer. He is watching a movie with our tickets. Now he'll drink the cold drink that your girl bought. He'll die free of cost when I stab him with this knife. Let's do it. Let the crowd reduce. You said there were fans in the theater. Now you say there is public. Will you stab him or not? I will stab you first. We need proper planning. Sorry, I didn't see you. Will my clothes get dry if you say sorry? They will get dry if you apply heat. Give me a hug. Pathetic! Hey, give me a hug. Let me go. - Hug me. Let me go. - Hug me. Why are you making this into a big issue? Let her go. How dare you touch Viju? How dare you touch me? What is that look? Will you hit? Will you hit me? What is it? I came to take their bodies. Take them away. - Okay. Let's go. Hey, what is that blood? Tomato sauce. Tomato sauce? Don't ask me questions. I'm in a shock. Go and watch the movie. Wash it off. Bye! Don't wave! That's enough. Why are you drinking so much? Your liver will get damaged. If I damage my liver, I can borrow some money.. ..go to Apollo Hospital and get myself a new one. What should I do when my lover is gone? A country has no harm from terrorism and naxalism. Our India is backward only because of beauty-ism. What does beauty-ism mean? Girls use their beauty as capital.. ..and make us go around them.. ..just like they rotate the interest. They will smile and convince us. For example, we buy shares of a good company. We expect guaranteed growth. But it shuts down without warranty. Even girls are like that. You compared beauty with money in a good way. ..if I had gone around India on foot.. ..I would've been in the Guinness Book. Just as they throw the cup after eating the ice-cream.. ..just as they remove a small hero's movie.. ..when a star hero's movie releases.. ..she this innocent man for a handsome man. Please don't trust beautiful girls. I feel the same. Let's go and confront her. If we go to her, she'll say she is getting married to him. We'll have to pay for the gifts and bouquets. Forget it. Okay, brother. She married him long ago in her heart. I've designed the marriage invitation in my heart long back I've sent it to you in my dreams I'll offer my love the black spot on my cheek I'll welcome you at first night with sublime scents I've received the marriage invitation.. is it true or a dream I replied to my beloved with my first kiss long back I'll get a lovely garland of fresh blooms for you I'll entertain you in the beautiful evenings of the season I've designed the marriage invitation in my heart long back I replied to my beloved with my first kiss long back The new season of love has begun The birds sing tunes of love The breeze has an air of intoxication The jasmines are ready to adorn your lovely hair Your gaze pierces into my heart I desire to embrace your beauty with all my heart That is how this story will go to climax I've received the marriage invitation.. is it true or a dream I've designed the marriage invitation in my heart long back My love for stayed unexpressed for long I wrote this letter of love for you with words unspoken I yearned for your love for a long time I waited for you just as a garden waits for the blooms You sly looks carry lots of news There are many desires waiting to be fulfilled That is how this story will go to climax I've designed the marriage invitation in my heart long back I've sent it to you in my dreams I'll get a lovely garland of fresh blooms for you I'll entertain you in the beautiful evenings of the season I've designed the marriage invitation in my heart long back I've received the marriage invitation.. is it true or a dream Doctor, how is my daughter? How is she? Are you really her parents? Sir.. You gave steroids to a ten year old girl.. ..to make her look like an eighteen year old.. ..so that you can make her a prostitute to earn money. We didn't do it, sir. Rawat's brothers.. ..Badvel and Taxi Seth did that. Because of poverty we put our children on jobs. But they give steroids to those small girls.. ..turn them into women and sell them for prostitution. They are separating small kids from their parents. Half of the taxis in Kolkata belong to Taxi Seth. They kidnap small girls like my daughter who get into.. ..his taxis, promise them jobs, turn them into prostitutes.. ..and later sell them off to men in other countries. Why didn't you complain to the police about this? Nobody has the courage to confront them, sir. You might not have the courage, I have it. What? - Yes. A girl gave this statement against Badvel before dying. These are her blood samples and DNA reports. Finally I saw a man that has the courage to confront him. These proofs are enough to arrest him. Yes, Siddhu. Why didn't you come for lunch on your anniversary? Sister is waiting for you. Where are you? I came to Old Binni Mills. What? What work do you have there? I came here for an important work. Ask your sister to eat food. I'll come later. Okay, come soon. Where to? We need to see Badvel. Take off your uniform and come inside. Why did you come in your police uniform? Did you come to arrest me? Someone has complained against you.. ..for the first time in Kolkata with strong proofs. He came to me without knowing that I'm your man. If he had gone to someone else.. You should think about the diseases, doctor. Why do you bother about other people? Did you really think you can go against me in Kolkata? He may have sold himself to you. If the police can't do anything, I'll give these proofs.. ..to the media and get you hanged in the public. Yes? Badvel! Badvel! Nobody should question me even if I sell or kill people. You might kill me today, but one day you'll die like a dog. Brother! Kolkata belongs to me and my brother. Brother! Brother! Are you the doctor's brother-in-law? Yes. Your brother-in-law complained against our boss. Boss got angry and killed him just now. His body is lying there. Take it away and burn it. Brother! Brother! Open your eyes. Take the body with you and leave. If you talk about police and post mortem, he'll kill you too. He will kill your sister as well. If they have any kids, he will kill them as well. Who among you is Badvel? Who is Badvel here? Who is Badvel? Me. What? Will you kill me? I won't be called Siddharth Naayak anymore.. ..if I don't kill you today on the busiest roads of Kolkata. Come! No, don't kill me. Please, I beg of you. So many people must have begged you like this. Did you spare them? Yes? Kill the rascal! Kill him! What did my brother-in-law do? Will you kill him because he complained against you? 'Somebody should confront him one day or the other.' The man who killed Badvel shouldn't be alive. I should kill him with my hands. Where is he? I'll stay right here. Your husband was right. He is not alive today.. ..because there is nobody to confront them. Nobody else should die. Kolkata should be rid of Rawat and his men. What are you saying? He died because he went and confronted them. How can we life if you lose your life as well? We shouldn't run with fear. They should run away with fear. They will run away. I bind you by oath that you should come with us. Sister, listen to me. You don't have a brother-in-law now. If you don't listen to me, you won't have a sister too. Sister.. - Let's go. Son, I heard that you killed Badvel. I came because I wanted to see you. He killed my four sons and left me childless. I don't know whose son you are. You should live long. Will you stay here? Won't you? Let's go. Come on. Wait, son! All of us are very happy that at last.. ..there is a man to confront them. Please don't leave. We don't need any of this. Let's go. Brother, please don't leave. You are our courage. You should be here as our support, as our leader. We will stand behind you. You think you can sneak away after killing my brother? Do you know why you are still here? Because I wanted to kill you with my hands. Because I wanted to kill you with my hands. Are you happy that he stood against me? I will kill him right before you. Watch! Take sister and go away. We'll be fine. Please go. People are ready to die for you. Does that mean you are a leader now? Why don't you speak? Are you a leader? Yes, my brother is a leader. Siddhu, I wanted you to be with us. But you should be with these people. The people around are afraid of him. But he should be afraid of you. He should be afraid to hear your name. Take her away. I can kill you in one second. Your eyes should see your empire falling down. Your ears should hear about your defeat. Looking at the torture you've to endure.. ..no goon will dare to walk in Kolkata. You will need my permission to live or to die. Naayak! Siddharth Naayak! Can we do nothing? Should I taste defeat in the hands of a man that.. ..is not even as old as my experience? I need to kill him! I need to kill him with these hands! Boss, he went to the factory with a big crowd. Study well. I'm here if you need anything. Okay, brother. He became an instant leader like instant coffee. Brother, we need to chop him into pieces. Do something. Don't go near him, boss. If you touch him.. ..east, west, north, south, the whole state will be shaken. His fan following is increasing by the day. They shower flowers on him when he walks. They sing praises to him all the time. All the current MLAs, MPs, IAS and IPS officers.. ..everyone is on his side. Even the minister who won with your support met him. You can only hear Naayak's name everywhere in Kolkata. He saved the girls that Rawat and his brother.. ..were exporting to the foreign countries.. ..and became a God to them. He also brought back all the young women.. ..suffering abroad away from their parents back to India. I never thought I'll see you again, dad. We don't know whom he spoke to or what he did. But he gave us our children back. All these years we've seen people taking up weapons.. ..to do injustice or to make others do it. For the first time, we are seeing a leader.. ..that took up weapons. I want to see him once, mom. It would've been better if he has killed us both together. Why should we live this stupid life.. ..thinking about him and fearing him every moment? Let's go away from here. Let's leave this city. He will leave, not us. Not just the city, the whole earth. Call all the rowdies, goons, partners, supporters.. ..and every criminal that cheated people.. ..using Rawat's name all these years. Tell them that Naayak wants to meet them. Hello, boss! Why are all the rowdies and goons of the city here? Boss, you wagged your tail behind Rawat till yesterday. Why did you suddenly come to meet Naayak? What if Rawat finds out? We will be in form only when we follow.. ..a hero that has following and a leader that's in form. Silly man! Follow me. Why are you guys waiting here? They asked us to wait here. We should go in only when our name is called. Oh, he'll call us individually and discuss.. ..the percentage without anybody else's knowledge. I'm scared that he'll beat us up inside. Not just you, even boss is scared. Shut up! Just as we cover the body with a shirt.. ..let us cover our fear with words. Okay. Hello, Naayak sir. Hello, sir. You asked me to be here in an hour. But I came in half an hour. Shukla, you've come as soon as I called you. What will you have? Coffee, tea or cold drinks? I'll take a photo with you. Photo? Yes, I'll tell everyone that Naayak is my friend. I'll use the craze that public has for you. I committed 100 murders and 50 rapes till date. I illegally occupied all the lands I wanted. I made the whole Kolkata weep. But even my neighbor doesn't know my name. Only police know me. You did a single murder. You became state famous and a star. Just say yes. I'll use your name and.. ..collect 10 billion rupees by this evening. Should I do it? Will you give me permission? Are you ready, sir? How will you get so much money? Even Tata and Birla can't get that much money. How will they get it? Are they great goons? What will be your property worth? Do rowdies earn so much money? You can count that as just change. I'll give you more money than Rawat. I'll turn this old house into a palace. I'll shake up Ambanis in just half a day. If you say yes, we'll talk about percentage. projects, and tenders. Is that okay? I'm not able to refuse your offer. Percentage is okay. Go inside and sign the documents. Agreement for being a rowdy? Hats off, Naayak sir. Which room should I go to for the agreement? He signed with his left hand to go to the right. Let's go to the right. Shukla! Naayak sir's partner. Policemen, lawyers, judge, registrar! He is making all the rowdies his legal partners. This man is a quality man. He is an educated man, boss. Not a rascal like us. Where should I sign? Sir, will you have a look at your properties? Okay. That is mine. Mine. That is mine. Mine. Mine. Mine. I see them every day. They are my properties. Tell me where to sign. I'll just sign. Sign here. Please, come on. Give me the pen. Congrats, boss. You are Naayak's sir partner now. Shukla's luck is shining on him. Take a chocolate, sir. Why a chocolate as if I did great service to the country? You really did a great work. - What did I do? You gave away all your property to an orphanage. What are you saying? I feel as if my nerves are cut. When did I give away my property? That's what the document says. You've signed it. You don't have any legal rights on the property now. With what purpose did you call me inside? With what purpose did you take my signatures? How can you take away all my property.. ..and send me out as a pauper? Hey! I'm Shukla! How dare you mess with me? I'll kill a man for each second. There are 100 goons outside. They'll come in as soon as I whistle. What is it, Shukla? Why are you shouting? Am I shouting? You took away my property.. ..of 50 billion and gave me a chocolate of 50 paisa. Shouldn't I shout? Should I sing a song coolly? Should I sing a song like this? You didn't understand what's going on here. You'll understand that when you go to the next room. You gave me a chocolate in this room. Will you give me a biscuit in that room? He's very emotional. Take him quickly. I came to the next room. What now? You have bodies like oxen. What are you doing in this room when.. ..great injustice is taking place in that room? Didn't you lose your property like me? You have bodies, I have brain. Let's fight together. We'll lose nothing but our lives in a fight. Why are you staring at me without speaking? They don't like men who lost their property. They look like men that will beat us up. Whistle immediately. They can't hear you even if you whistle. Why? We have some good sound arrangements here. Oh God! Even in a dream it takes a whole night.. ..for me to lose so much property. How did I lose it with just a small signature? Yes, boss. I still can't believe it. My clothes are intact but the body is not working. How could they beat us up so nicely? Yes, boss. Even trained police don't beat up like this. Eat the chocolate, boss. Throw it away! Throw it! I remember my lost property when I see it. Oh God! Why are you sitting here? We are sitting here because they asked us to sit. Are they beating up people inside as we thought? Why will they beat us up? What wrong did we do? What did you speak to him and how much did you fix? We don't have to speak anything. They ask you to sign as soon as you go inside. They give a chocolate as soon as you sign. That's it. Very simple. Is it okay if I increase the percentage? You can ask whatever you want for your personality. But you will have to sign. I don't have a pen with me. Pens, stamps, chocolates, everything is inside. Go. Hello, Naayak sir. Come in, Rajput. Be it forgery, piracy, fake passports or court stamps. Everything is piracy. You've earned a lot of money. If you give a second, he'll forge your sign too. Shut up! Why will I forge his signature? I've earned a lot, Naayak sir. That's why I called you up. Fix the percentage and give me the chocolate quickly. They'll give you inside. Go and take it. Okay, Naayak sir. Should I meet you again after taking the chocolate? No. The whole program goes according to a process. He must've got his chocolate by now. Congrats! All your property is transferred.. ..to Mother Teresa Trust. What are you saying? Why will I give them away to Mother Teresa Trust? I won't agree to it. Boss, the music has started inside. The poor man has a loose body. It must've become even looser. We somehow managed to come here. Will he be able to walk till here? Or will he collapse on the way? He's here. Why didn't you tell me about the cheating inside? I would've escaped had you given me a missed call. Okay, you give missed calls to the others in queue. No need. Let them lose their properties like we lost ours. I was silent because of the same feeling. Even you remain silent. Okay. Give me that chocolate. I'm coming. Why are you guys eating chocolates like small kids? They are treating us like small kids inside. They don't feel that we are rowdies and goons. Go inside, sign the papers and get a chocolate. Go! Rajput! He is a strong man even though he is thin. He is walking quite well. They are beating up according to the body type. Then they must've bashed you up pretty badly. You've informed about the chocolates. Why didn't you tell us about the sound system? Would you've gone inside if I had told you? Welcome, Raja! You were very excited while going inside. Now you all look very tired. Did they beat you up inside? Why will they beat us up? We go to a hospital for a health checkup. They make us walk on a treadmill. Won't you be tired? This is the same. They give us a fruit drink there. But here they give us a chocolate. That's it. Go and get it. Something is fishy. I'll meet him later. I'll switch off my cell phone. Brother, he is escaping. Let's run! Oh God! Brother, save me. Thank God they caught him. I was worried that he'll escape. Are you happy? - Yes. It's okay if we are ruined. The neighbor shouldn't thrive. That's our Indian psychology. I love you, Raja. Is everybody here or is there someone left? Who else will be there, boss? All of them look like uprooted trees in a storm. Brother has called you inside. How can we come? Nobody's legs are in working condition. There are many diabetes patients here. If you delay another half an hour, half of them will die. Send us home, we'll leave. Will you all come or should I call brother? No. We'll muster up all our strength and come. Oh God! Terrible pain! Oh God! Anyone that does illegal businesses, scams.. ..schemes and donations shouldn't stay in Kolkata now. You should leave this city in half an hour. We get six months to vacate even a rented place. How can you ask us to leave in just half an hour? I say everything just once. The second time, I kill. Our state has weapons to kill him. But there are no men to catch him. So, I brought these men from Tihar. Look, he is not a rowdy or a goon. He has a fan community in every street. He has a fan in every house. If you mess up, he'll kill us along with you. Why are you scared? He is a human, is he not? If we press the trigger, he'll be hit with a bullet. Yes, but do that carefully. Where is he? He's in a wedding reception in his colony. I am a beauty from Howrah and you are a hero from Andhra At any hour that you choose, I'll be ready for you You may touch and feel my beauty as you please This is the place for real love Nellore is another name for romance I am a beauty from Howrah and you are a hero from Andhra At any hour that you choose, I'll be ready for you You may touch and feel my beauty as you please Singur is the place for full-blooded action We shall put up camp in Guntur O lovely damsel, I am ready for action C'mon and I shall show you what I am made of I shall enthrall you with my magic all night I shall serve you my beauty like tasty food with wine I like your power and style and I became your fan I have come to enjoy your beauty and show my might You make all sort of statements and put me in a fix This is the place for real love Nellore is another name for romance You are like a juicy fruit from Nairobi I will start the game like emperors of yore O young prince.. your charm puts the shackles on me Take the veil off me and see the cracker that I am Your non-stop invitation is forcing me to follow you If you promise to enthrall me, I'll offer my juicy lips to you It is great to have milk and honey before the act of love Singur is the place for full-blooded action We shall put up camp in Guntur Who sent you? Rawat and DIG. Sir, our men were caught. They revealed your name and my name. He will definitely attack us. Okay, inform him that we are in the minister's house. He will come there alone in his anger. One shot, two birds. I got it. Why are you so tense? You have to save me. My shadow might leave me, but Naayak won't. I lost my property, my men, and everything else. I just have my life left. Save me. Boss, he is here. An apple tree doesn't give grapes. I made you a minister, but you went to him. Sir! Naayak killed the minister! What are you talking about? People outside say that you are a great God. Great Gods should be in photos and idols. They shouldn't be alive like you. I will take back all the land you gave to the poor. I will start all my businesses that you shut down. I will hunt down your followers and kill them. I will take the post of this dead old man.. ..and become the minister in a week. Hey! - Yes, boss? Is he dead? He is dead, boss. Throw him in the river Ganges. Okay, boss. Make an entry in the police records.. ..that he is absconding after murdering the minister. Okay, sir. Only we know that he is dead. People will wait in hope that he will return. 'The Goddess saved me.' 'lnstead of proving that I didn't kill the minister..' '..it became my goal to kill these beasts..' '..without getting caught by the law.' Mom, let's go. Where to? That's a train bound to Kolkata. We are going there. Why? I'll tell you. Naayak! Someone came to meet you. - Who? Someone called Cherry. He looks exactly like you. Hi, my name is Cherry. Siddharth. I read about you and came to meet you. Why? One side there is police. One side there are people that he killed. One side there are people that want to kill him. How can we software people handle such hardware men? But he won't listen to me. Hello, Rawat sir. Where did you disappear? Just recently I became capable of walking again, sir. Don't worry, sir. No harm will come to a good man like you. These days people die of septic infection.. ..if a small nail pricks them. You are alive even after he stabbed you with a spear. So, no harm will come to you. He is already a suspect in the minister's murder case. And there are proofs that he stabbed you. He will be given a death sentence. But still, I have my doubts. For safety, tell our men to kill him before.. ..he is presented in the court. That's not possible, sir. - Why? He'll be surrounded by thousands tomorrow. What? form a human chain.. ..to bring him safely to the court tomorrow. Long live Naayak! Long live Naayak! Even though he looks like a kid.. ..he has a huge fan following. Your fan following depends on your works, not age. Don't worry, boss. This crowd can't do anything. Even millions of people can't affect the judge's decision. He will get a death sentence. Why do they say that you'll get a death sentence? You are worried that I'll get a death sentence. But I'm worried that he is still alive. No harm will come to you. Your Honor! He is a suspect in Home Minister's murder. He killed the DGP and Taxi Seth in a.. ..premeditative, willful and revengeful manner. We also have strong proof that he tried to.. ..murder the current Home Minister, Mr. Rawat. I request the court to give him a death sentence.. ..so that nobody dares to become a criminal like him. Do you accept that you did these crimes? Why do you ask him whether he accepts or not? You have strong evidences against him. Without wasting the court's time.. ..give him a death sentence. Wait! The court has some rules. Do you accept these crimes? Yes, sir. I did all those crimes. Since he accepts his crimes, under IPC sections 302.. ..and 307, the accused is sentenced to death.. Wait, Your Honor! Who is this, boss? He looks exactly like Naayak. Is he the real Naayak? I've gone mad. It is like I'm watching a 3D movie without the glasses. We told him to go home. Why did he come here? Hello, sir! Who are you? You look exactly like him. My name is Siddharth Naayak. I did those murders. No, Your Honor! I'm Siddharth Naayak. I think he is one of my fans. He dressed up like me and came here.. ..to take my crimes onto his head. No, Judge! He is one of my fans. He dressed up like me and came here.. ..to take my crimes onto his head. Don't ruin your life to save me. I'm telling you the same thing. Don't ruin your.. Stop it! What is this rubbish? If you are Naayak, who is he? My fan. If you are his fan, who are you? Siddharth Naayak. No, I'm Siddharth Naayak. No, it's me. - No, it's me. I'm Siddharth Naayak. I'm Siddharth Naayak. Judge, I know who stabbed me. This man stabbed me. He is Naayak. Hang him to death. No, Your Honor! He is a little confused. If you send him out for 5 minutes.. ..I will talk to you in private. Court is adjourned for 5 minutes. Darn! Did anyone imagine this? It's like a winning cricket match was stopped.. ..because of sudden rains. What is this nonsense? Who is that second man? He is a software engineer from Hyderabad. Even we got confused and arrested him first. What? Did you see the second man earlier? Yes. We arrested him and later released him.. ..because he is innocent. Darn! Who made you a CBI agent? Take it easy, sir. Sir, it's a very long gap. I think they must've definitely changed places. Be careful. Now tell me. Which of these men stabbed you? They must've definitely changed places. This man, sir. But earlier you said that man stabbed you. Didn't they change their places? No, they didn't. Stupid fellow! Hang both of them and finish the matter. Hang both of them, Judge. Sir! - Don't leave them. Hang both of them. Silence! You are a man with a responsible post. You shouldn't be talking like this. It's okay if hundred criminals escape. But it's not okay to punish an innocent man. Now this case will never be solved. Since both of them look exactly the same.. ..we are not able to identify the real murderer. The CBI is ordered to keep both of them.. ..under house arrest with their friends and family members.. ..identify the real murderer and bring him to the court. I'm giving them 10 days time. Follow them both. Sir, it's useless to follow them. If a brave man meets an intelligent man.. ..CBI or CID can't do anything. Stop praising them and do your job. Go. I'm going. I don't what to say or how to say it to your son. We are humans, dear. We should help each other. Thank God! Hey! Do you think you are safe? After 10 days, the judge, these people.. ..and I will come to court. But you won't come. You'll be dead. Since he gave a warning to Rawat, he is Naayak. No, it's me. If you are Naayak, why did he give the warning? I sent him because he was free. So, is that man your nephew? When CBI agents like you can't identify him.. ..how can a mere CEO like me identify him? This case will never be solved amidst such people. Sir, saline. Boss, don't increase your blood pressure. You can fight with anyone in life, but not with a lucky man. We killed one man and threw him in the river.. ..but he came out as two men. Boss, listen to me. Go to the police station and.. ..tell them that you've nothing to do with Naayak.. ..you are not Rawat and you don't live in Kolkata.. ..you are not from India but from far away Scotland. It's better to withdraw the case and escape from here. How can that be possible? We filed a case against him. We should make Naayak confess that he is Naayak. I will make him confess. Bring one family member of Cherry from Hyderabad. Naayak will confess the truth for that person's safety. Who are you guys? Does your daughter love a man called Cherry? Yes. So what? Rawat asked us bring your family to Kolkata. Did her love story reach Kolkata? Who is this Rawat? Don't ask me details. Just get into the vehicles. How dare you threaten our boss? Even we are goons, we did many settlements. Stop it! Why are you arguing with them? Can't you see the guns in their hands? Boss, Naayak's men are here. Where are Rawat's men? They ran away. Please come with us. It's not safe to be here. Come with you? Who are you guys now? We are Naayak sir's men. Who is he? You'll know when you come to Kolkata. Ask your daughter to come quickly. Why should she come? Even Cherry is with us. So he is there now, is it? Dear! - Yes, uncle? We have to go to Kolkata. Come down. I'm coming. I'm applying lipstick. By applying such silly things you've turned.. ..this peaceful house into a public park. Where is Cherry, brother? Where is Cherry? - He will be here. Welcome! Welcome to Kolkata. We are forced to go around different houses.. ..since the time you stepped into our house. Now why did you call us to Kolkata? Don't worry. Naayak sir thought you'll be safe here. Naayak? Why are you guys thinking of our safety? Don't be upset. You'll be shocked to see the real twist. We've had to leave our state because of the current twist. Will you make us leave the country too? Cherry! How can she hug him right before us? Disgusting! We are unfortunate, uncle. Excuse me, I'm not Cherry. What? I'm not Cherry. Why does he say he's not Cherry? He said there's a twist, didn't he? How was your journey? It was without our consent. I heard you are like family to Cherry. What is your name? I'm Amitabh Bachchan. He is Abhishek Bachchan. Is this passport renewal? Why the new introductions? Jalebi! - Yes? Did he lose his memory? Why will he bring you here if he has lost his memory? Turn your face. Hi! Hello! I'm Cherry! Really? Hug me and find out. Uncle, he is Cherry. I'm very sure. We saw. Please maintain a little distance, dear. How many more should she hug? There are 7 lookalikes for each person. Shut up, you fool! Even two are too much to handle. If another five men appear, she'll have high fever. What is all this about? Mom and dad are inside. They'll tell you everything. Okay. Uncle, why are you drinking raw alcohol? I feel like drinking blood. What can I do? Sir, can I say something? Had he given his sister to me without seeing my age.. ..we would've met in the engagement party for fun. You wouldn't have had all these troubles. Just think about this thing. Remove the part where I went to see his sister.. ..from this story, you will understand it yourself. Why did you kick me, boss? You rascal! Is your sister an angel or Aishwarya Rai? Why didn't you get her married to him? How can I get her married to this old man, boss? No, your sister will get Pawan Kalyan's son.. ..or Mahesh Babu's son as her husband. Uncle! - What is it? Uncle, I got confused again. I kissed Siddhu thinking it was Cherry. He may misunderstand me. Please go and explain. Do you want me to become the mediator now? Sister! - What did she do now? I opened the bathroom door thinking it was Siddhu. Cherry was inside. Sorry, sister. That's okay. Why not go to the bedroom instead of bathroom? I went the other day, uncle. But I got confused there too. Darn! Boss, just like Gandhi is a grandfather to everyone.. ..you became an uncle to everyone here. I'll break your face with this. Jalebi! - Sir? Show them both their right lovers. How can I identify them when their lovers can't? Only you have clarity about the whole program here. Take them. - Okay, sir. Let's go, girls. Poor Jalebi! They confused us in half a minute.. ..even though we've been following them for 6 months. Till they achieve their target.. ..they both will be Naayaks to everyone. And both these girls will be their heroines.

Why did you come back? Don't worry, Mr. Rawat. I'll give you a fantastic idea.. ..with which you can finish both of them together. What is that? I'll tell you. Hello! Naayak! I know that you love people. Come alone to Kolkata Steels in ten minutes. Otherwise 200 school kids will be blown up in a blast. Hey! Are you searching for the kids? Do you want to save them? I lied to you that I'll kill the children. You came here. This was a plan to kill you. You can't win even if you kill me. I'm not Naayak as you think. I'm Cherry. Really? Then why didn't you say that in court? Shut up! Should I tell you a small twist? You had called up Naayak. But I answered that call. Naayak is not my brother. He is a good man. You are a bad man. He should live to kill you. So, I'm ready to die for him. You both have turned us into fools. I will kill you as per your desire. Sis, where's my phone? - I don't know. Naayak, Cherry is dying for you. Come and save him. You've just five minutes. Come! One left a while ago. Now another one is leaving. Is he Naayak or Cherry? How would I know? - Darn! What? - Sir, I suspect that they'll kill Rawat. Boss, Naayak is dead. Yes! Naayak is dead! He is dead! Superb news, boss. Kill this one as well. Otherwise people will turn him into Naayak. That's right. - He'll kill you. He was burnt to ashes. You'll be blown to pieces. Put that bomb jacket on him. Happy death day! He is beating him up brutally. Doesn't he have any feelings? You've only tasted Kolkata punches till date. Now I'll make you taste Charminar's punches. Why is he putting the bomb jacket on him? Chocolates for us and jacket for him. Boss! Their bodies are moving. But, of what use will their lives be? What happened here? Where is Mr. Rawat? He was blown off. What? - Yes, sir. Was he a firecracker or something? If he was a firecracker, we would've seen the remains. But there are no remains left of him. Who did that to him? - Naayak. There are two Naayaks now. Which one of them? Actually, the one.. Shut up! You'll fare better if you stop your loose talk. Or you'll get locked by the CBI. I don't know anything, sir. Then what are you doing here? I heard we get Puttur oil to heal broken bones. We came here for that, sir. Puttur is in Chittoor. This is Kolkata. Sir, this fellow is an idiot. We got into Howrah Express instead of Sarkar Express. It seems this is Kolkata. You got me into a train for Kolkata like an idiot. The Sarkar Express was on platform number.. Sir, one man was blown to pieces. The witnesses ran away. Our witness won't be taken into account. We'll close the case as it has no evidences. We'll forget everything and have a drink. I knew that this case won't get solved. Yes, Gajalaxmi. I'm coming. Jalebi! - Yes? I hope all the twists are done. Will there be any more twists before we get to Hyderabad? What other twists will be there, uncle? Only their weddings are left. Please get me married along with them, sir. Hey! I'll kill you if you talk about your wedding again. Cherry, you took a big risk that nobody will to save me. I can never forget you. Brother, I did it for your loved ones, not for you. You should be safe. Okay? Thank you. I heard you gave summons to.. ..vacate Gandhinagar Colony. That is a government land. People are not for the government. Government is for the people.
