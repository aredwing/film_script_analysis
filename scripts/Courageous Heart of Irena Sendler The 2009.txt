Yes, l will come right away. l will walk, so twenty minutes. Please, stay calm. Irenka? lt's all right, Mama. Go back to sleep. - Thank God, you are here. - Where is she? ln the cupboard. Tonight, when Krzysztof came home the way our neighbours looked at him we were betrayed. l just know. l'm sorry, Irena. lf the Germans find us hiding a Jew, they will shoot us. Hello, Anna, it's Irena. You do not need to be afraid. And tonight... you will stay with me. Would you like that? How many mothers do you have? l just have one. Already, l had three. Shh. Why do they not like me? Who does not like you? My mothers. Your mothers love you. And l love you. And l will always love you. Go to sleep. - We have to go now. - Here. lt is safe to take her out in broad daylight? She looks like one of us. Are you worried? Not one bit. Mama, hmm? - Ahh, good. - Eva will love it. lt's perfect. Mama! Take your medicine. Mama, please. You are so funny. You're a wonderful girl. The second doll with the long locks was called Bella. Come in Anna! Anna, this is Miss Jadwiga. Hello, sweetie. Come in. Thank you. Come in. Anna, you can play with Miss Jadwiga's children while l find you a lovely place to live. You're a good girl. - Take care of her. - Hello, sweetie. She has passed outside the ghetto all this time. There must be - a Polish family who can take her. - Not any we know personally. l'll ask father Godlewski he will know some we can trust. - Wait. You mean now? - His soup kitchen's on my way. - You're going to the Ghetto? - Yes. l will see you later. Get out of here. Irena Sendler, you work? Department of Social Services. l see that, my question is about today, why are you here? Inspection of the refugee centers. Prevent the spread of typhus. You Poles must solve this problem, it's a disgrace. Go in. Next please, documents. Only bread today, take it. Go. l told you once l won't tell you again. You're not hungry? Please, please buy it from me. Father Godlewski. Good morning. Ah, Irena. What do you hear? ln the last two weeks, they have filled train cars of Jews in Luxemburg and Vienna, deported them all to the ghetto in Lodz - and here, every day they bring more. You know we are doing all we can to help Jews survive outside the ghetto. - Yes, l know, very well. - And today l have a little girl - and no Polish family to hide her. - It's not easy for Poles either. - Perhaps in your congregation? -Irena, please... ...of all people you know the risk for a Polish family. Even so, is it not possible there are some or even many Poles who want to help but don't know how? Yes, yes, yes. It is possible. Eva. Irena. Come, come. - Good morning, Hannah. - Oh, Irenka. Always such a faithful friend. God bless you. Rabbi Rozenfeld. Dear Irena, how are you this fine day? ls this work for a Rabbi? We all must live with dignity, especially in days of hatred. Miss Irena! Miss Irena! Karolyna! Or should l say, the famous Miss Nijinska, Prima ballerina? Do you know what l learned to do! Do you want to see? Of course, you must show me! Brava! - How is your mother? - Well enough, if she behaves. - And your Jacob? - Last week he came back into - the Ghetto to hug his daughter. - And to kiss you, l'm sure. Maybe yes, a little. l brought a few things. Let me, let me! And this. Irena, what do we have here? You made this? Can you imagine me putting two stitches together? - Then your mother. - She misses you. So do l. My dearest friends in the whole world. Please thank her. Eva, l need to talk with you. Over the last few weeks, they have deported freight cars of Jews from Austria to the ghetto in Lodz. We heard last night. The Jewish Council says they will send to workcamps. Eva, your Jewish Council was appointed by Germans. How many years have we listened to their terrible propaganda? What they say about Jews, what they say - they have in mind... - It's just talk, rumor. Who can believe it? These are cultured people. Anyway, we're almost five hundred thousand in this Ghetto. What could they do? Yes, yes... l know. lt's so confusing. One day somebody says something is true, another says it's not. Every day l wake up, my body is cold. We have to get you all out of here. They would never leave. l could never leave them. l can find Polish families willing to hide you. Most people believe it's better to stay all together, inside the wall. l want you safe... - ...all of you. - Irena, what is safe? Where? Good morning, Miss Irena. Good morning, Doctor Majkowski, have you had a chance to consider my-- Yes, l have selected your friend, Maria Debinska to join your department. Thank you, doctor. - Good morning. - Good morning, Miss Irena. Maria, welcome to our little department, thank you. My thanks to you. - Good morning, Miss Irena. - You missed an exciting meeting. Issued today, the new ration card. ghetto. So we will have starvation along with a Typhus epidemic. And winter almost here. We'll need to bring in food, clothing, medicine - Maria, talk to Doctor Majkowski, see how much Typhus vaccine you can get. Since The Occupation Jadwiga has done a brilliant job of trying to balance an impossible budget. But... But, if we continue to spread our services over every district in Warsaw, we will not be helping anyone. From now on we must focus our full attention on the ghetto. Excuse me, Miss Irena. The Jewish Quarter is not our problem. Why not? The Germans put them there to protect us. Protect us from what? Maria, you are a nurse, you know very well. What do l know, tell me? They have lice, spread disease and... You know what l'm talking about. Danuta, how can half a million cramped people stay in good health. One reason, another reason what does it matter. All l know is l am not going to bring Typhus home to my family. Whatever it is you're thinking, l am sorry - l can't be part of it. Anyone else who does not agree with this direction, l will arrange a department transfer. Stefania, you have only been with us two months. l have not yet been inside the walls, but l know l must do it. Stefania. We are at war. You are a soldier now. A soldier must be tough or she cannot fight. Oh! Hold her. Hold her still, good, good. - Why do you bother? - Because we want your child to survive. lf you want her to live, please, take her from me, get her out of here. l'm begging you, take her outside the wall. - l'm sorry. - It's not possible. Next! Please, Mama, go back to bed. l am fine. Do not worry. What is it? Tell me. Irena? Irenka, tell me what. Today, l understood something. Something about what? l thought l was doing all l could but the truth is l am doing nothing. Nothing? ls it my imagination or was there a little Jewish child sleeping in your bed last night. One child is not enough! Oh Irena, you are so like your father. Little Anna has always lived outside the Ghetto. Inside the wall there are thousands of children who could be rescued. Take them out? ls that what you're thinking? Past the Gestapo? German soldiers, Jewish police? How is that possible? You are a social worker, a good social worker with the biggest heart l know but to risk everything for something you know nothing about... l remember what father used to say. You see a man drowning, you must try to save him, even if you can't swim. For you? Two loaves, please. - You are a Jew. - No, l'm not. One of those filthy little smugglers from the ghetto. No, l'm Polish. Let's see you make the sign of the cross! Let's go! With this red hair, you do not think you look Jewish? - And get yourself a cap. - Yes, miss. lf you want to survive outside the Ghetto you must lie with more conviction. And learn how to cross yourself. Like this. Now, you. Again. Quickly! Very good. Get out of here. Wait! Who is it? Hide! They're coming here. Shh. l'm afraid. l want to help children inside, the, ghetto. lt is very dangerous - too dangerous. Yes, probably, but what would it take? Well, l suppose an organized network of people you trust, enough money for each child's room and board. And if you agree, more Polish families willing to hide a Jewish child. - l will try to find some. - What about identity cards? That shouldn't be hard, if l destroy some of the parish death certificates, issue new baptismal certificates. That is all the proof Germans need for an identity card. The only thing is, how to get them out? There is someone you must talk to-- a young man who smuggles potatoes from the Aryan side, he works in Korczak's orphanage. Ask him to introduce you to Stefan Zgrzembski. - Zgrzembski? - Yes, that's him. Guten morgen, Father. Doctor Korczak, how many children live inside the ghetto? lncluding all the ones who live in the streets? There must be at least eighty thousand, half under the age of ten. Be brave now. Have you ever tried to get any out? Out to where? Not so many Poles want to hide a Jewish child. And how many Jews would let their children live with Gentiles? What about orphans, these ones? Even if you found a way, most of mine could not survive outside the wall. - Why not? - She only speaks Yiddish. Is that not right? They all speak excellent Yiddish. Polish, that's another matter. And they are all beautiful but most are not passable as Aryan. Irena? Oh, Stefan. lt's been a long time. Irena is here to see you. You attended my classes together. Yes, a long time ago. Let me deal with these horrible little savages! l have found something here with Doctor Korczak and the children. l am glad. But you still smuggle potatoes. Irena Sendler, always straight to the point. Tell me how. l know a few safe ways to get out, the courthouse has two ways out, one from the ghetto side and one from the Aryan side. That's in the ghetto, from the Aryan side it's by Ogrodowa street. l... l know a man with the key. - The other ways? - l can show you. The main sewer line goes all the way down to the central junction under Gdanski station. - And from there? - Anywhere you want. One line goes under Okopowa Street, another under goes under Marszalkowska, third line goes under New Town and Miodowa Street. The Germans keep the courts so busy they have forgotten this entrance. You remember our summer walks along the Vistula River? Every step. Shall we? Welcome to Warsaw. Thank you, Stefan. We will use this way first. - Be careful. - You know me. That is what l mean. Be careful about yourself. Hurry up, hurry up. Hello. You remember me? What's your name? The boy who sits beside you every day. ls he your brother? He died. l'm very sorry. Can you tell me where you live? All right. Come with me. We have hot soup. Just made for you. Are you going to get her changed in here? Yes. l think it's a good idea. - Oh, you are so hungry. - All right. We need to do something about her hair. - Can we braid it? - Please help if you would. All right. - Lets take this skirt off. - Good girl. And try a beret. lt will keep you warm. Ah, much better. Good girl. You look so beautiful. Ready for a little walk in the courthouse? My name is Miriam. Come along, sweetie, we must-- Such a little trouble-maker. You have no idea. Come along, sweetheart. - You want to play with this? - Thank you. - Rabbi. - For me? Such a dashing fashion for a Rabbi. And for you, Miss Nijinska! Oh yes, l remember this book! - Come in. Oh, yes. Come in, come in! - Thank you Rabbi. So many people without shelter. Eva. Hannah, come here. Take this place. Shall we read a little bit? Why do l have to be a Jew? You were born into the Jewish faith. What if l want to be something else? l don't like being hated by everybody. Everybody does not hate you. Yes they do. You know it's true. What did we ever do? lt's not fair. No, It's not. There are ways to get out of the ghetto, ways that are still safe. - l cannot. - Yes, l know. But l've been thinking about Karolyna. Karolyna? We know Polish families who can be trusted, several priests, - convents in the countryside. - Stop, Irena! Let me ask you one thing, tell me from your heart. How is it possible for a mother to give up a child? How? Now l must ask you something - a terrible thing. No, no don't, please... lf it happened that the rumors are true and if for Karolyna you had to choose between life and death... - Please, l cannot face it, l cannot. - You can, Eva - and you must. Irenka. Do you know what this author says about life? - Mama, please, l have to go. - Please. Take one moment to breathe. Please. What this writer says is in order to have a happy life, you must exercise your own free will. Interesting. Bye-bye. Which is why l would never tell you not to do something or suggest to you that l might possibly be worried. l would never do such a thing. No matter what happens. Thank you, Mama. Thank you. - What has happened? - All the Social Service programs - have been suspended. - Who has access? From now on only nurses, doctors, workers in the Health Department. Today l was told l am officially responsible for any further spread of Typhus. You know it is impossible, what do they-- Of course it's impossible. That's their point. lf l cannot help myself, how can l help you? l will need Health Department work passes, four - no, no maybe five nurse's uniforms. lt that all? Perhaps a larger vehicle. We will seek orphans and homeless in the market area and specific families we already know are willing to let us place their children... One of Doctor Majkowski's drivers has volunteered, Piotr Lipinski. Miss Irena. - Hello. - Hello. Thank you, Piotr. You understand the risk? Only small problems, but l am not too worried. We will take my disinfectant truck. - l beg you, keep them together. - l'm sorry, it's not possible. Sister Jolanta, please understand whatever happens they will always have each other. One slip, one word in Yiddish. They could give each other away. How will l ever find them? How will they find each other. The important thing is to survive. Take her. Please go! Tell me, what do you want to be when you grow up? A priest. Yes, very good, that's perfect! You can do it. Papers? Vehicle check. What do you have in the truck? - We have a problem. Vehicle check. - All right. Let's go for a walk. Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name... Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us... Children! Let's show Miss Irena how we know our bedtime prayers. Now l lay me down to sleep, l pray the Lord my soul to keep; And if l die before l wake, l pray the Lord my soul to take. First month. Room and board. ls there anything else l should know? She had a brother. - This is Adam. - Hello, Adam! - Does he speak Polish? - Perfectly. Irena. Jacob! l'm sorry, l didn't mean to frighten you. ls Eva all right, Karolyna? Yes, everything's the same. Eva has met with community leaders. They want to speak about - hiding their children. - Of course. You had a good instinct, to rescue Karolyna, it's risky but there is no other way. And what if my wife and l do not survive the war. Who will claim our son? l keep a record of every child. And if this record or you are destroyed? What guarantee can you give our children will survive? l can't guarantee anything, not even escape from the Ghetto. Babies pass easily but if they can speak, they must speak Polish, know Catholic hymns and prayers. My children only speak Yiddish. l understand this is very difficult. They will need to memorize their new Christian names, their new home address, the entire history of their new family, harmless gossip about their neighbors - all of it. What you are saying is we must teach our children to lie. To survive, yes. - What about conversion? - l make it clear l do not wish this. You may not wish it, but on young, impressionable minds, time and education will surely dim any memories of their past. ln this case, he will grow up a good Christian. For mothers and fathers, to give away a child is an unthinkable act. This is the truth. The other truth is Hitler calls Jews a cancer on the nation and speaks openly about the annihilation of every Jew on the continent. Outside these walls there are Poles prepared to risk their lives to save your children. We Jews - We Jews have survived in the hardest times. And now we are faced with another extinction. Perhaps this time we can only be saved by a new generation of Jews. How wise are we to take away the birthright of this new generation? l recommend we consider this proposal. Thank you. l am not in favor of sending our children into such a dubious world. Now America is in the war. This news favors our liberation and for this, we should wait. Our dear friend has presented us with the difficult truths of our time. We should thank her for her courage to speak. Quickly. Jasio go back, there's another bag! - No! l will not. - Go get it! Let me go!!! No, No!!! Sister Jolanta. Walk with me. Please, please. My name is Michal Laski, l know who you are and what you do. The man you saw just now. He is Untersturmfuhrer Karl Brandt. He is in charge of Jewish Resettlement. We are told in a few months they will begin to send everyone in the ghetto to work camps in the East. - Why do you tell me this? - l have a son - Jasio, 10 years old. His... His mother died last year. He has no one. - He has you. - He lives with smugglers, goes under the wall at night, risks his life every day. l want to get him out before he's caught and shot. lf from time to time l help you, will you help me? Mr. Laski, l will help your son without conditions. lf from time to time you help me, you would be helping many children, - including your son. - There's a passage through a brick wall on Twarda Street. On the other side in the abandoned house. Does your Jasio have red hair like you? Yes but thanks to God he now wears a cap. You know about this new German unit now in charge of the Ghetto. Yes, for work camp resettlement. Stefan, do not be like this. You know how many thousands of Jews have disappeared from the Lodz Ghetto. Vanished. And to where? Some place they call Resettlement. Doctor Korczak told me to prepare for the worst. lf there is no other way, that is what l must do. Where is everyone? What has happened? Books, bank accounts, invoices, reciepts they've taken over all of it. Who? Guten tag. Amen. Karolyna, can you tell us why this night is different from all other nights? Sweetheart? l know why tonight is different. Tonight is different because once we were slaves and now we are free! Jacob! Papa! l am not here for Sedar. l have some news you must hear. Eva. The underground received information verified by Polish train machinists, some lucky Jews who escaped, even from a few good Germans. They all say camps are being built. Concentration camps, work camps. Auschwitz is like this, we know. You remember the thousands of Jews who were deported from Lodz, the ones who disappeared. Last week 300 train cars of clothing returned for sorting. What else, Jacob? We hear rumors they are building another camp. Treblinka. Only 90 kilometers from Warsaw where there are fake station platforms, underground bunkers. One thing they have not constructed - barracks. No barracks, l do not understand. Why no barracks? Mama, they do not... ln such a camp, the only purpose is death. We need to find a way to get you out of the Ghetto. Get out, you say! Get out how? Get out to where? Papa, Irena has made an offer for Karolyna. There is a convent in the countryside. This is not possible. She will be converted! Never! Chaim! These many months l have said nothing. Now l will give my opinion. Our dearest Irena has risked her life for us many times. Now, she has made an offer for Karolyna we must accept. - l believe a convent is best. - No, it must not be done. Chaim Rozenfeld! You have loved me since l was a little girl in pigtails and after these many years you know very well an opinion from me is not a suggestion. Next time, when you come she will be prepared. Irena, the Underground knows what you're doing. They want to help. There's a man you should speak to, goes by the name Trojan. Zurawia, 24. For Karolyna, l promise, l will do everything... We know that, Irena. We know. l'm Trojan. - And l'm Victor. - Who do you represent? - Konrad Zegota. - Why me? What do you know? You created an efficient network, saved many children. So far no one has been betrayed or exposed. We, with the Underground, have a good deal of money, and contacts. It could be a good arrangement. - This money, where does it come from? - Polish government in exile in London. - To help Jews? - Zegota exists only for that. - Who is Konrad Zegota? - He does not exist. Which makes him hard to find, especially for Germans who will never stop looking. What is your proposal? We will help you rescue children. If you agree. l agree. We'll give you money, Aryan papers, work records. You'll get them while picking up the linen from the laundry at Bracka street, near the Three Crosses Square. This will be our contact point. - Looks like we're back in business. - Let me count. Look. Identification cards. Very good work. These will do. - What's going on? - They're deporting adults and children. - Orphanages? - Yes. Stefan. Stefan. You must get out. Do it, for me, for the children. You must see and remember and tell the world. - No. - Go. Go on. Quickly. Now. Go, go, quickly! You know how to do it. May God walk with you. Go! Go! Thanks be to God! They took all the children. l saw them, l couldn't do anything about it. l've heard this news. Who told you? Your friend. Let's go son, don't be afraid l'll hide you to keep you warm. Are you ok? - There is a chance today. - Please, one more day, just one. Now it is possible, tomorrow is uncertain. We can't do it now. Please, one more day, just one. Now it's possible. Tomorrow is uncertain. Tomorrow he will be ready, l promise. You mustn't lock the door. Jews who refuse to leave the building will be executed. Run downstairs, run. No more courthouse entrance. A big problem. Oh, stop fiddling, You're making me nervous. You need to get more rest. For Heaven's sake, if l'd had a stroke, l'd be dead. l'm telling you, l got up too fast, l fainted. That's all. You are in bad condition, l'm not joking. You are a very brave young woman. Stefan? There's room for two. What are you doing? A little carpentry. What do you think? l feel a little bit confined. l think l need to get out. lt's, it's not opening. It's stuck. lt, it, hmm... Can you please try? Please. - It's stuck from the outside. - No. Please, open it. Please. OK. All right, l need to, we need to get out of here. We must call your mother. Mama? Irenka? Jasio? Jasio? Do you remember? l can't leave them. l will not. You, you have done a good thing, Jasio, a very important thing and it may be hard to understand but the future will need your compassion even more than now. Which is why tomorrow you must save yourself. You know the coal room? Where the Rabbis study? Two o'clock tomorrow my friend will meet you there. She wears bright red lipstick. Be strong, say your good byes. l will never see you again. l will never see any of you again, any of you. Yes, you will, l promise. No, you can't promise. Nobody can promise anything any more! Darling. Darling, darling, l love you with all my heart. My love for you is so big and strong it will never go away. lt will always be with you. Whenever you think of me, l will be there, right over your shoulder. Forever and ever. - Your name? - Aniela Procowna. - And where are you from? - Krakow, Poland. But when l grow up l want to live in Bavaria. My uncle says Germany is much more beautiful... - Your name? - Aniela Procowna. - And where are you from? - Krakow, Poland. But when l grow up l want to live in Bavaria. My uncle... Quick, quick in! Out, out. Get out of here. Out, get out! Out. Out! l will not! Jasio? Mr. Laski! Out, out! You - come with me! And you, come! Move. Get away from here - but slowly. - l saw Jasio. He will get out. - Thank you. Maria. Jasio? l know. Come. Come. Jasio! Jasio! Jasio! Jasio! No! Let me through. Jasio! Jasio! Jasio! Papa, papa. - l tried to get out but they-- - It's all right, it's all right. All that matters is that we are together. Hold onto to me so we don't get separated. Faster, faster. Hold on to me, hold on to me. -Simon! There has been a mistake! No! He's my son! My family is protected! All Jews inside! My family is protected! Everyone inside! Papa! Jasio! Papa! Papa! Jasio, l understand now why you lived in the street. lt was God's way to make you strong so you can survive. Here, give him my sweater. l cannot do it. l'm afraid, Papa. Please, l can't. - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. - No. l can't. Please. l'm afraid. Jasio, listen to me. Land on your elbows, keep your head down. - Come with me. - Keep your head down and stay still until you see the train is gone. l love you, Papa. Then you must run as fast as you can into the trees. l love you, Papa. Please! Come with me. l don't want to please! Shh. Shh! Be quiet! You must be brave. l can't! Papa! l can't. Please come with me. Please. One. - No! Please! - One, two. Papa! Three! ... my God. Look at that. Thank you. My darling. Children! Children, shh. Children, this is Anielka. She will be joining us. Please don't leave me, please. This war will end and you will survive to be a mother and tell your story. And one day, if we are both very clever, l will find you. l promise. Now there is something you must promise me. You must promise that you will always remember that you are the famous Miss Nijinska, Prima ballerina. l love you. Me too. Go on, now. Shouldn't you have taught me this as a child? - Over and under. - It's beautiful. - You are so mean. - It is a mess do it again. - He's telling the truth. - It's hideous. This is never going to be... l give up. Gestapo. l will do it. Irena Sendler? l am. - Look in the bathroom and kitchen. Do you have Jews here? Of course not. It's against the law. We'll find out. You will come with us. Let me get a few things. There's no need. Irena Sendler, good afternoon. l work for Department of Social Services. l know. l know. Your father was a doctor, worked with Jews. - He worked with anyone who was sick. - Yes. Until the Jews gave him Typhus. Who is Konrad Zegota? Who? Who is Konrad Zegota? l don't know. Who is Konrad Zegota? l don't know. You have been denounced by many people. For example, the little shop where you pick up your laundry on Bracka Street near Three Crosses Square. We know you are not so involved with these criminals. And if you tell us where to find this man you will not be executed. Sendler, out! What does it mean? Sendler. Dentist. ZEGOTA WILL HELP. You're wasting your time and mine. l'm ordered to place a dressing, l place a dressing. For what? She will be dead in the morning. l do what l'm told, that's all. Stefania? You're alive! l swear, l told them nothing. l was quiet as a mouse. - You know l would never betray you. - As a good soldier. - Yes. - A good soldier. You have done very well. Everyone out! Out! Not you! No! No, wait. Wait! Aim! Fire! Get away from here! Go! Go! Go! But, l, l don't have my identification card! Stupid woman! You are dead! With them. Go! Run away! Get out! Irena! Viktor. They'll find out. And they'll look for you. l'll be safe. Your mother is right, your feet need a specialist. l know it's hard but please try not to walk too much. Promise me... you won't come to my funeral. - Mama, don't say such things. - Promise me. Irenka. Can l tell you something. l'm... proud... of you. Very proud So many l could not save. You've done a good and decent thing. ln this world that's not so bad. lt's time. We must be in the mountains before dark. Mama. Don't worry, l'll be fine. Go. Wait, Irena. Trojan. Thank you so much for all you've done. No. Thank you. There's something Konrad Zegota must have. They're all here. Every child. Where we hid them. When all this is over, they must be returned to whatever remains of their families. l will do it. l promise. Thank you. From now on you are Klara Dabrowska. Once upon a time, there was a little girl l am so fond of stories that begin that way. l have kielbasa, bread... - You like? - Yes, l do. Good! - First, you must come meet my pigs. - Really Piotr, that's not necessary. One thing l can say about town folk, they make terrible farmers. Please, let me down. Oh, thank God. - Are you all right? - Now, yes We must fight for what is good. Good must prevail. lt must prevail and l believe in this. As long as l'm alive... as long as l have strength... l will say good is best. Love, tolerance and humility - -that's it.
