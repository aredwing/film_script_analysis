BREATHTAKINGLY UNEXPECTED, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS THE SEARING FLASH THAT ANNOUNCED THE ATOMIC AGE. EQUALLY UNEXPECTED WAS THE NEXT GIGANTIC STRIDE-- WHEN MAN MOVED OUT OF HIS VERY ORBIT... TO A POINT MORE THAN... [ High-pitched Whooshing ] PEPE, IS IT YOUR DESIRE THAT THE FISHES, THEY SWIM AWAY ? COME ON ! PULL UP ON THE NET. HERE. [ Mutters ] MANY ROPES TO CATCH A LITTLE FISH. NOW, IN TEXAS, JUS FOR ONE LITTLE ROPE... SHE CATCHES A BIG COW. THE NET. THE NET ! TEXAS. TEXAS. WHAT IS THAT ? OH, MONDELLO, YOU DO NOT KNOW OF TEXAS ? SHE'S A BIG COUNTRY ACROSS THE SEA, NEAR AMERICA. [ Whooshing ] THAT'S WHERE THE COWBOYS-- SILENZIO ! [ Whooshing Continues ] LOOK ! WE GO BACK. WHY, VERRICO ? IT IS A POSSIBILITY THAT IN THE AIRCRAF THERE MAY BE PEOPLE. BUT VERRICO, THAT IS NO USUAL AIRCRAFT. THERE ARE NO PEOPLE ON IT. AH, MONDELLO, YOU KNOW THIS THING, YOU SAY ? YOU WERE PERHAPS INSIDE OF IT, HUH ? WHAT ARE WE, CHILDREN OR MEN OF THE SEA ? WE GO BACK. WE GO BACK. LOOK. A HOLE. PEPE, THE BOAT HOOK ! MONDELLO, YOU COME WITH ME. IT MAY BE I WILL NEED YOUR HELP.

[ Mondello ] NEVER MIND THE OTHER PEOPLE ! SAVE YOURSELF ! GET OUT OF THERE ! [ Loud Banging ] [ Explosions ] [ Grunting ] VERRICO, THE OARS. [ Panting ] THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE THAN TWO MEN IN THERE. MOST CERTAINLY, PEPE. BUT WE COULD NOT REACH THEM. MAY THEY REST IN PEACE. WELL, FROM ALL INDICATIONS, SHE'S SPLASHED IN SOMEWHERE RIGHT HERE, UNDER THE SEA. PERHAPS NOT, GENERAL. CALDER MAY HAVE REGAINED CONTROL. I APPRECIATE YOUR OPTIMISM, DOCTOR, BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT READS. WE GOT A RADAR BLIP ON HER JUST OFF ICELAND-- ALTITUDE: 200 MILES; RATE OF DESCENT-- WHAT WAS IT ? ANOTHER SIGHTING BY STILLMAN FROM MARSEILLES. RATE OF DESCENT STILL I'M SORRY, DOCTOR. THAT PUTS HER RIGHT DOWN WITH THE FISH. WHAT MAKES ME SICK INSIDE IS THAT THEY WERE SO CLOSE-- SO VERY, VERY CLOSE. THEY MADE IT THERE AND ALMOST MADE IT BACK. [ Phone Rings ] MAJOR STACY SPEAKING. HOLD IT. TELL THE GENERAL. McINTOSH. YES ? WHERE ? IS THAT CONFIRMED ? THANK YOU. SHE'S DOWN OFF SICILY, DOCTOR, ONLY A FEW KILOMETERS OFF THE COAST OF A FISHING VILLAGE NAMED GERRA. WHERE IS IT ? THERE IT IS, RIGHT THERE. MAJOR, WE'LL NEED THE COOPERATION AND COURTESY OF THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT. GET THE STATE DEPARTMEN ON THE PHONE. WE GOT A GREEN LIGHT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. TELL THEM TO GE THE ITALIAN EMBASSY TO CLEAR THE PATH FOR US. TELL THEM WE'RE IN A HURRY AND TO PUT THE RED TAPE IN A DRAWER UNTIL THIS IS OVER. AFTER THAT, CALL TRANSPORT. TELL THEM THE DOCTOR AND I ARE LEAVING NOW FOR SICILY. [ Major ] YES, SIR. [ Dialing ] [ Chattering, Indistinct ] [ Italian ] TAKE THEM TO THE COMUNE DI GERRA,QUICKLY. MONDELLO, GET A DOCTOR. SI, SIGNOR COMMISSARIO. [ Italian ] YOU WERE INSIDE THE WRECK. WERE ONLY THOSE TWO MEN ABOARD ? NO. I WAS INSIDE WITH MONDELLO. WE SAW ONE MORE MAN, BUT IT WAS A CERTAIN THING HE WAS DEAD. BUT, SIGNORCOMMISSARIO, THE SHIP OF THE AIR, SHE WAS SO BIG, SO VAST, SURELY THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OTHER MEN INSIDE TOO. [ Commissario ] I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED... AND TELL ME ABOUT IT SLOWLY. [ Man ] SIGNOR COMMISSARIO ! SIGNOR COMMISSARIO ! THE DOCTOR IS NOT AT HOME. HE'S FAR OVER A SIGNORA MARTINELLI... WHO IS IMMEDIATELY HAVINGBAMBINO. PERHAPS TWINS AS BEFORE. WHO KNOWS ? AND SIGNOR MARTINELLI IS A VERY SICK MAN. THAT'S TOO BAD. THERE IS THAT OLD DOCTOR FROMROMATRAVELING WITH HIS AMERICAN GRANDDAUGHTER. IS HE STILL HERE ?

AND DOTTORE BORINO IS WITH SIGNORA MARTINELLI WHO'S ABOUT TO HAVE TWINS, TRIPLETS. I'M AFRAID I WON'T BE OF ANY HELP. I'M A DOCTOR IN ZOOLOGY, NOT MEDICINE. BUT MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS POSSIBLE. MARISA. AH ! SIGNORINA. YOU ARE A DOCTOR FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HURT ? NOT YET. NOT FOR ANOTHER YEAR. [ Groans ] I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN. [ Italian ] [ Italian ] [ Both Men Speaking ] COME THIS WAY. BE BACK AS SOON AS I CAN, GRANDPA. [ Italian ] [ Italian ] AH, GOOD AFTERNOON, MY YOUNG MERCHANT FRIEND. AND WHAT IS IT YOU WISH TO SELL ME TODAY AT AN EXORBITANT RATE, I'M CERTAIN ? AN INEDIBLE CLAM WITH WHICH YOU ARE WILLING TO PART FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY, I AM SURE. DR. LEONARDO, YOU ARE A KIND MAN, A JUST MAN, A MAN OF MUCH LEARNING, A MAN OF GREAT WEALTH. A MAN OF WEALTH, A PROFESSOR OF-- OF COURSE, PEPE. COME ON IN, MY SICILIAN BANDIT, AND WE'LL BARGAIN, HUH ? [ Chuckles ] COME ON. YOU HAVE 200 LIRA ? THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT I HAVE SUCH A FORTUNE. [ Groans ] NOW, TELL ME. LET ME SEE THIS GREAT TREASURE OF SUCH GREAT VALUE. COME ON. YOU HAVE 200 LIRA WITH YOU IN YOUR PURSE ? UH-HUH. YES. THAT IS A TRUE FACT ? SURE, THAT IS A TRUE FACT. BUT NOW TELL ME. WHY IS YOUR NEED SO GREA AND SO URGENT ? BECAUSE WITH THE 200 LIRA, I CAN PURCHASE A HAT FROM TEXAS. HMM ? PLEASE, MAY I HAVE MY MONEY NOW ? A HAT FROM TEXAS ? I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU, PEPE. IT IS THE HA THE COWBOYS WEAR WHEN THEY SHOOT THEBANDITO. BANG, BANG ! AND THE MAN, HE IS DEAD.

AS FAR AS I KNOW, YOUR-- YOUR AIRCRAFT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. WHOEVER ELSE WAS ON IT-- EXCEPT FOR THIS MAN. HIS CONDITION IS CRITICAL. I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'RE IN NO CONDITION TO GET OUT OF BED ! DOCTOR ? DR. SHARMAN ? I MUST ASK YOU TO LEAVE THIS MAN ALONE. HE'S EXTREMELY ILL. PLEASE. PLEASE. - DR. SHARMAN, CAN YOU HEAR ME ? - WILL YOU LEAVE THIS MAN ALONE AND GO BACK TO YOUR BED ! LISTEN, NURSE, I AM IN NO MOOD TO ARGUE WITH YOU ! I'M NOT A NURSE ! I'M A DOCTOR-- OR ALMOST A DOCTOR. AND THIS MAN MAY BE DYING. ALL RIGHT, "ALMOST A DOCTOR," DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM ? -NO, NOT EXACTLY. - WELL, I DO. AND I KNOW IT'S FATAL. EIGHT OF MY CREW HAVE ALREADY DIED FROM IT.

[ Panting Stops ] HE'S DEAD. I KNOW. BETTER GET SOME SLEEP. PLEASANT DREAMS. [ Whimpers ] GRANDPA ? GRANDPA ! WHAT IS IT ? MY GLOVES-- WHERE ARE MY GLOVES ? UNDER THE TABLE. WHAT IS IT ? WHERE'D IT COME FROM ? PEPE, THE LITTLE FISHER BOY. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. NO SCIENTIFIC RECORD OF SUCH A CREATURE. LOOK AT THE TORSO. THE TORSO'S THA OF A HUMAN BEING. AND-- AND THE ARTICULATION ON THE LEGS. LOOK AT IT ! LOOK AT IT ! BUT FROM WHERE ? [ Whimpers ] THE CAGE. THE CAGE, MARISA. SOFTEN THE FLOOR, MARISA. THE FLOORING OF THE CAGE IS ROUGH AND HARD. [ Marisa ] IT'S SO VERY UGLY. AND YET, IT SEEMS SO FRIGHTENED. [ Whimpering ] COME INSIDE, MIA CARA. MARISA, COME. [ Screeching ] MARISA ! MARISA ! WHAT IS IT, GRANDPA ? COME HERE. COME HERE. OBSERVE. OBSERVE OUR STRANGE FRIEND. LOOK AT HOW MUCH HE HAS GROWN IN BUT A FEW HOURS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE ! THINK, MARISA. THINK OF WHAT WILL BE SAID WHEN I BRING THIS STRANGE CREATURE... TO THEGIARDINO ZOOLOGICAL INROMA. NOW I'M GOING TO THE VILLAGE, AND I'M GOING TO SEE THE YOUNG FISHER BOY... AND LEARN FROM HIM WHERE IN THE SEA IT WAS THAT HE FOUND OUR FRIEND. POW ! POW ! VERRICO, MONDELLO. [ Italian ] CAN YOU INFORM ME OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE BOY PEPE ? PEPE ? HE'S RIGHT OVER HERE PLAYING LIKE A TEXAS COWBOY. WHERE ? OH, HE HAS GONE. YET HE WAS HERE A FEW MOMENTS AGO. BUT I WILL SEE HIM TONIGHT, DOTTORE,AND I WILL TELL HIM TO SEEK YOU TOMORROW. TOMORROW I WON'T BE HERE. I'M JUST NOW ON MY WAY TO ROME. [ Italian ] IT'S ALL RIGHT. [ Whispering ] POW, POW, POW ! WELCOME TO GERRA. MAY I INTRODUCE MYSELF, GENERAL ? I'M THECOMMISSARIO OF THE POLICE. THANK YOU. THIS IS DR. UHL. [ Italian ] IT'S A PLEASURE. HOW DO YOU DO ? FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN ROME I RECEIVED A TELEGRAM. I'M TO COOPERATE WITH YOU. I'M AT YOUR SERVICE, SIGNORI. NOW, IF YOU WILL COME WITH ME, I WILL TAKE YOU TO COLONEL CALDER. HE'S NOT BADLY HURT ? OH, NO, GENERAL. DON'T YOU WORRY. HE RECOVERS QUICKLY. IT'S ALL I COULD DO TO KEEP HIM FROM COMING TO MEET YOU HIMSELF. THIS WAY, PLEASE. CONGRATULATIONS, BOB. YOU MADE IT. YOU MADE IT ! THE FIRST MAN IN OUR HISTORY. HOW DOES IT FEEL ? FINE, SIR, EXCEPT THAT-- WELL-- YES, I KNOW. IT'S TRAGIC THE OTHERS DIED IN THE MOMEN OF THEIR GLORY. BUT STILL, AND I MEAN IT, YOU DESERVE CONGRATULATIONS. MINE, TOO, BOB. YOU DID A MAGNIFICENT, HEROIC JOB. IS THERE SOMEPLACE WHERE WE CAN TALK PRIVATELY ? MY OFFICE IS YOURS, GENERAL. THIS WAY, PLEASE. [ Man ] ATTENZIONE. THECOMMISSARIO IS BEING BRIEFED IN HIS OFFICE. [ Italian ] I'M HONORED, SIGNORE. GENTLEMEN, MAY I INTRODUCE... SIGNOR CONTINO FROM THE ITALIAN DEPARTMENT OF STATE. GENERAL McINTOSH. SIGNOR. COLONEL CALDER. HI. DR. UHL. HOW DO YOU DO, SIR ? I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING SO PROMPTLY, SIGNOR. AND I WANT TO THANK YOUR GOVERNMENT FOR EXPRESSING ITS DESIRE TO COOPERATE. I MUST BEG YOU, HOWEVER, FOR THE MOMENT, TO OBSERVE STRICT SECRECY. IT IS UNDERSTOOD. WHAT I HAVE TO SAY YOU WILL FIND INCREDIBLE... BUT TRUE. COLONEL CALDER HERE HAS JUST RETURNED... FROM AN EXPEDITION TO VENUS. TO VENICE. PERHAPS YOU MEAN VENEZIA. TO VENUS-- THE PLANET VENUS. - "THE PLANET VENUS" ? - THAT IS CORRECT. I WAS INFORMED THIS MATTER WAS CONNECTED WITH SOMETHING VAST, BUT THE-- THE PLANET VENUS ? MAN'S FIRS INTERPLANETARY VOYAGE. ON THE RETURN TRIP, THE SPACESHIP WAS CRIPPLED BY A METEOR. EXCEPT FOR COLONEL CALDER HERE, THE ENTIRE CREW PERISHED. - I AM GRIEVED. - THE PROBLEM THAT CONFRONTS US IS THIS, SIGNOR-- THE ATMOSPHERE ON VENUS IS SUCH THAT A HUMAN BEING CANNO BREATHE AND SURVIVE FOR LONG, EVEN AFTER USING WHA WE CONSIDERED FOOLPROOF RESPIRATORY EQUIPMENT. SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE EXPEDITION DIED THERE BEFORE THE OTHERS REALIZED THE DANGER. AND DR. SHARMAN, THE CHIEF SCIENTIST, ALSO BECAME FATALLY ILL. HE DIED HERE AFTER THE SHIP CRASHED. FASCINATING. HORRIBLE, BUT FASCINATING. NOW, ON THAT SHIP WAS A PARTICULAR SEALED METAL CONTAINER. IN IT IS AN UNBORN SPECIMEN OF THE ANIMAL LIFE ON THE PLANET. WE'VE GOT TO FIND IT. OUR TASK IS TO DISCOVER IN WHAT PHYSIOLOGICAL WAY... LIFE IS ABLE TO SURVIVE AND TO FLOURISH THERE. NOT UNTIL THAT SECRE IS LEARNED CAN ANOTHER EXPEDITION EXPECT TO RETURN. AND RETURN WE MUST. FOR ON VENUS IMPORTANT MINERALS WERE DISCOVERED... THAT WOULD BE A VAST BENEFI TO OUR OWN CIVILIZATION. I'M AT YOUR DISPOSAL, GENERAL. IN WHAT WAY MAY I ASSIST YOU ? WE NEED DIVERS-- SEVERAL DIVERS TO DESCEND TO THE WRECK TO SEARCH FOR THE SPECIMEN. THEY WILL BE HERE IN THE MORNING. DON'T YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE FOR A WHILE ? NO. [ Italian ] BUONA FORTUNA. GRAZIE. AND NOW, SIGNORCOMMISSARIO, I SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE TWO FISHERMEN WHO WENT ABOARD THE WRECK. OF COURSE, GENERAL. I HAVE THEM WAITING. NOW, IF YOU WILL COME WITH ME, PLEASE. VERRICO, MONDELLO. ONE MOMENT OF YOUR TIME, PLEASE. SI, SIGNOR COMMISSARIO ? GENERAL, THIS IS VERRICO, AND THIS IS MONDELLO. THEY ARE THE TWO MEN WHO WENT INSIDE THE SHIP BEFORE SHE SANK. THE AMERICAN GENERAL WISHES TO SPEAK TO YOU... OF AN ITEM OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. WE ARE LOOKING FOR A CYLINDER... ABOUT THIS HIGH AND ABOUT THIS ROUND. VERY PROBABLY IT WENT DOWN WITH THE SHIP, BUT THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THA IT WAS KNOCKED LOOSE... AND MAY DRIFT ASHORE SOMEWHERE TODAY, TOMORROW-- WHO KNOWS. IT IS SO IMPORTAN THAT WE RECOVER THIS CONTAINER AND ITS CONTENTS... THAT I HAVE OFFERED A REWARD OF A HALF-MILLION LIRA. PLEASE SPREAD THAT INFORMATION AROUND TODAY. YOU WILL NOT TAKE MY HAT. SILENZIO. THE GENERAL IS SPEAKING. CONTINUE, GENERAL. [ Calder ] WAIT. WHAT IS IT, SON ? WHAT IS IT YOU WISH TO SAY ? IT IS ONLY IF I SPEAK OF THE THING FROM THE SHIP... THAT YOU MUST PROMISE TO ME THAT I MAY KEEP MY HA FROM THE GREAT COUNTRY OF TEXAS. WELL, OF COURSE YOU MAY KEEP YOUR HAT. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BIG CONTAINER ? AND THERE IS A MATTER OF A HALF-A-MILLION LIRA. HOW MUCH IS THAT ? SUFFICIENT TO PURCHASE FOR ME A COWBOY HORSE LIKE THEY RIDE IN TEXAS ? ENOUGH TO BUY MANY HORSES. NOW, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BIG CONTAINER ? YOU PROMISE TO ME ABOUT THE HAT, ABOUT THE HORSES ? YOU HAVE MY PROMISE, SON. IT IS THERE. COME ON. FOLLOW ME. PLEASE, MAY I HAVE MY HORSE NOW ? EMPTY. BUT I KNOW WHERE IT IS, THE THING FROM INSIDE. WHERE IS IT ? I TOOK IT TO THE PROFESSOR LEONARDO AND SOLD IT TO HIM FOR 200 LIRA. THAT IS HOW I HAVE THE HA FROM TEXAS. PROFESSOR LEONARDO, WHERE IS HE ? HE MUST BE SOMEWHERE ON THE ROAD TO MESSINA. HE SAID HE WAS GOING TOROMA -HOW WILL WE FIND HIM ? -HE DRIVES A TRUCK WITH A HOUSE THAT FOLLOWS LIKE A GOAT. A TRAILER. FIND IT AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN. I'LL WAIT HERE FOR THE DIVERS. YES, SIR. COME ON, DOC. WOULD YOU AND YOUR MEN ACCOMPANY THE COLONEL ? OF COURSE, GENERAL. BESIDES, I HAVE TO SEE A MAN ABOUT A HORSE. AND A HALF-A-MILLION LIRA. WHAT ? THE CANVAS HAS COME LOOSE. I BETTER STOP THEN. YOU KNOW, IT OCCURS TO ME THAT OUR FRIEND IS PERHAPS A MUTATION. BUT OF WHAT SPECIES, I DO NOT KNOW. HERE, YOU CATCH THIS ON THE OTHER SIDE, PLEASE. THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT MIGHT BE A TYPE OF THROWBACK TOWARD... A PREHISTORIC AND UNKNOWN-- [ Screaming ] [ Screeching ] [ Screaming ] [ Roaring ] [ Roaring Continues ] ARE YOU HURT ? NO, I-I DON'T THINK SO. I GUESS I FRIGHTENED I AS MUCH AS IT FRIGHTENED ME. BUT ITS CLAW WAS SO STRANGELY HOT. [ Vehicles Approaching ] I BEG YOUR PARDON, BUT YOU MUST BE-- COMMISSARIO ! A STRANGE ANIMAL ESCAPED. A STRANGE ANIMAL, LIKE SOMETHING YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE ? LIKE SOMETHING NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. - IT BROKE OUT OF ITS CAGE AND GRABBED ME BY THE ARM. - HELLO, "ALMOST A DOCTOR." [ Sighs ] THIS CREATURE, TELL ME ABOUT IT. WELL, FIRS IT WAS THIS HIGH. THEN THIS HIGH. NOW IT IS TALL. NEARLY AS TALL AS A MAN. IS THAT THE NORMAL RATE OF GROWTH ? NO, NOT AS FAR AS I KNOW. THE ONLY DATA WE HAVE IS IN DR. SHARMAN'S NOTES. WHERE'S THE ANIMAL NOW ? IT FLED INTO THE WOOD. LET'S GO. PLEASE, PLEASE, WAIT, WAIT. TELL ME, WHAT IS THAT CREATURE ? WHERE DOES IT COME FROM ? I MUST KNOW. WE'LL GO WITH YOU. I'M SORRY, PROFESSOR. I CAN'T NOW. THANKS FOR YOUR HELP. WELL, LOOKS AS THOUGH MY PATIENT HAS FULLY RECOVERED. [ Horse Neighing ] [ Roaring ] [ Whinnying ] [ Roaring ] [ Bleating ] [ Bleating ] [ Dog Barking ] [ Barking Continues ] [ Horse Whinnying ] [ Barking ] [ Growling ] [ Barks, Snarls ] [ Screeching ] [ Barking ] [ Dog Yelping ] CARLO ? CARLO ? CARLO ? CARLO ? WHAT YOU GOT, BOY ? [ Carlo Yelps ] CARLO ? DON'T MOVE. STAY WHERE YOU ARE. LET'S BACK OUT QUIETLY. [ Roars ] INCREDIBLE. THE CREATURE HAS TO BE TAKEN ALIVE. THERE'S A CART OUTSIDE. WOULD YOU HAVE YOUR MEN BRING IT IN THE BARN ? [ Italian ] NOW WILL YOU GET ME A LONG WOODEN POLE ? I'VE HAD NIGHTMARES IN MY TIME, BUT I'VE NEVER DREAMED OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS. ACTUALLY, THEY'RE NO FEROCIOUS UNLESS THEY'RE PROVOKED. THAT POOR DOG MUST'VE JUMPED HIM FIRST. THAT'S GOOD. [ Roars ] THAT'S JUST WHAT I NEED. GRAZIE. NOW, I'M GONNA TRY AND PROD THE CREATURE RIGH INTO THAT CART. IF I CAN GET HIM IN THERE, BE READY TO SHUT THAT GATE. [ Screeches ] COME ON DOWN, FELLA. JUMP. COME ON. COME ON. OKAY, COME ON DOWN. COME ON. ALL RIGHT, COME ON. COME ON DOWN. COME ON. COME ON. [ Roars ] GET BACK. [ Roaring ] GET BACK. LOOK OUT ! NO ! STOP IT ! [ Screeching ] [ Screaming ] HELP ! HELP ! HELP ! [ Screams ] [ Creature Roaring ] [ Roaring Continues ] [ Banging ] ALL RIGHT, MEN. OVER THIS WAY ! [ Italian ] I DON'T LIKE IT ! COLONEL ? YEAH ? I HATE TO INTRUDE ON YOUR PRECIOUS PRIVATE THOUGHTS, BUT I'D LIKE TO CHANGE THE BANDAGE ON YOUR ARM. OH. YOU'RE WORRIED ABOU WHAT HAPPENED TODAY-- ABOUT WHERE THE CREATURE IS TONIGHT, AREN'T YOU ? WE'LL FIND HIM. WE'VE GOT TO. I GUESS I'VE BEEN PRETTY INCONSIDERATE AND SELF-CENTERED. YOU'VE HAD A LO ON YOUR MIND. IF THAT'S AN APOLOGY, I THINK IT WENT IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. ALL YOU'VE DONE IS TRY TO HELP. ALL I'VE DONE IS SNARL AT YOU. I HOPE WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER YOU'LL LET ME TRY TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU... OVER A TABLE FOR TWO IN A DARK CAFE. WITH A CANDLE BURNING ON THE TABLE ? AND A BOTTLE OF WINE. BOB. BOB CALDER. EXCUSE ME. HERE'S SOMETHING, BOB. SHARMAN WROTE THAT THE DIET OF THESE CREATURES IS RAW SULFUR. I REMEMBER THAT MUCH. THERE ARE RICH SULFUR BEDS IN SICILY, NOT MANY KILOMETERS FROM HERE AT THE BASE OF MOUNT ETNA. WE'LL SCOUR THAT MOUNTAIN AREA AS SOON AS IT'S LIGHT. IF THE CREATURE'S THERE, WE'LL RECAPTURE IT. AT THAT TIME I WOULD CONSIDER IT AN HONOR TO OFFER THE FACILITIES... OF THEGIARDINO ZOOLOGICAL INROMAFOR ITS OBSERVATION AND EXAMINATION. THAT WILL NO BE NECESSARY, GENTLEMEN. - THERE IS NO LONGER TIME TO RECAPTURE THE MONSTER ALIVE. - I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I MUST INFORM YOU, SIGNORE, THAT THERE IS NO MORE COOPERATION BETWEEN US. THE BEAST MUST BE DESTROYED. HE HAS INJURED ONE MAN BADLY... AND HE MIGHT KILL OTHERS. MY DUTIES ARE TO THE WELFARE OF MY PEOPLE, NOT THIS CRAZY SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT. COMMISSARIO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT ! COMMISSARIO ? SIGNORE, PLEASE WAIT. [ Italian ] SIGNORE-- GET IN. THAT IS MY POSITION. THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS DISTRICT IS MY AFFAIR-- MY PRIMARY AFFAIR AS LONG AS I'MCOMMISSARIO. MAYBE YOU CAN HAVE ME REPLACED. THAT, OF COURSE, IS YOUR PRIVILEGE. UNTIL THEN, I WILL FUNCTION ASCOMMISSARIO. YOU ARE AN EFFICIENT MAN, SIGNORE. A MAN OF SINCERITY. THERE WILL BE NO THOUGH OF REPLACING YOU. THEN I MUST SAY, AT DAYBREAK, I INTEND TO USE EVERY MEANS AT MY DISPOSAL... TO DESTROY THAT CREATURE BEFORE HE KILLS SOMEONE. BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT ! BOB ? YES, SIR ? MAY I REMIND YOU THECOMMISSARIO IS A SICILIAN POLICE CHIEF... PERFORMING THE DUTIES OF HIS OFFICE. I KNOW THAT, SIR, BUT-- BUT WHAT ? WOULD THERE BE ANY OBJECTION IF DR. UHL AND I TRIED TO TRACK THIS ANIMAL AND TAKE IT ALIVE ? BEFORE THECOMMISSARIO HAS HIM DESTROYED ? NOT FOR ME. SIGNOR CONTINO ? HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO THIS ? ON VENUS, WE DISCOVERED QUITE BY ACCIDENT... THAT THESE CREATURES ARE EXTREMELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ELECTRIC SHOCK... AND THAT CONTROLLED VOLTAGE CAN PARALYZE THEM. NOW, IF WE COULD HAVE TWO HELICOPTERS AND A SQUAD OF ARMED PARATROOPERS, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DROP AN ELECTRICALLY CHARGED WIRE NET ON THE BEAST. A NET. ALL I ASK, SIR, IS PERMISSION TO TRY. IF-- IF THIS CAN BE DONE... BEFORE ANY HUMAN LIFE IS THREATENED, THE ITALIAN GOVERNMEN WILL HAVE NO OBJECTION. ALL RIGHT, BOB, YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR COPTERS. THANK YOU, SIR. THANK YOU, SIGNOR. THE HOOK'S WORKING FINE, SIR. THAT'S GOOD, SERGEANT. TAKES THOSE SACKS OF SULFUR OVER TO THE OTHER COPTER. LOOK. WE'RE TAKING OVER A LOAD OF SULFUR TO FEED OUR PRISONER WHEN WE CAPTURE HIM. IF THECOMMISSARIO DOESN'T CAPTURE IT FIRST. YEAH. [ Barking ] [ Italian ] -DOC, THIS IS LIKE A PARACHUTE. IT'S GOTTA WORK THE FIRST TIME. -RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, MEN, LOAD UP. LET'S GO. [ Barking ] [ Roars ] [ Italian ] [ Roars ] [ Italian ] [ Gunshots ] LET'S USE THE BACK ROAD THROUGH THE WATERFALL. [ Italian ] [ Screeching ] - WE SPOTTED THE ANIMAL. IT'S RIGHT BY THOSE SULFUR PITS. - RIGHT. [ Roars ] [ Screeches ] WE CAN'T DROP THE NE TILL IT'S CLEAR. I'LL DROP THE SULFUR NOW. [ Screeches ] [ Screeches ] [ Screeches ] IT'S TAKING THE BAIT, DOC. WE'RE READY TO MOVE. OKAY. WE'LL STAND BY. [ Screeches ] ANOTHER FEW FEET, AND YOU GOT IT, DOC. DROP IT. [ Screeching ] NOW. [ Screeching ] HURRY IT UP. CAREFUL. [ Screeching ] WE'RE READY, DOC. JUMP CLEAR ! HIT IT ! [ Electricity Crackling ] [ Screeching ] [ Sighs ] MAPLES HERE. NO, NO, JOHN. NOTHING'S HAPPENED YET. YES, I WILL. IF YOU WILL ALL COME IN, PLEASE. THE GENERAL WILL SEE YOU NOW. LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING NOW. KEEP THE LINE OPEN. [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Italian ] GOOD MORNING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS. I AM FULLY AWARE OF THE RUMORS... THAT BEGAN WITH AN AIR CRASH TEN DAYS AGO... OFF THE COAS OF SICILY. NOT UNTIL NOW HAVE I RECEIVED PERMISSION... TO MAKE KNOWN THE FACTS EXACTLY AS THEY ARE. THIS CABLEGRAM HAS BEEN SIGNED... BY THE UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. "IN THE FACE OF WIDESPREAD SPECULATION, "AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, "THE PRESIDENT HAS AUTHORIZED RELEASE OF ALL INFORMATION... "TO PRESS AND NEWS AGENCIES FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION. "THE AIRSHIP XY-21, "WHICH CRASHED INTO THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA ON THE 11th, "WAS A SINGLE-STAGE, ASTRO-PROPELLED ROCKET... "LAUNCHED 13 MONTHS AGO FROM A SITE WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. "THE ROCKET, WITH ITS COMPLEMENT OF 17 MEN, "HAD LANDED ON THE PLANET VENUS-- VENUS ? THE PLANET VENUS ? "HAD LANDED ON THE PLANET VENUS... "AND WAS ON THE RETURN FLIGHT TO EARTH... WHEN THE SHIP PLUNGED INTO THE SEA." THERE WAS ONE SURVIVOR-- COLONEL CALDER, SEATED BESIDE ME, COMMANDER OF THE EXPEDITION. SOME OF YOU MAY ALSO HAVE HEARD THE STORY... OF A MONSTER NOW CONFINED HERE IN ROME'S ZOO. THAT BEAST IS FROM VENUS. IT IS AN ESSENTIAL OBJEC OF SCIENTIFIC STUDY... IF MAN IS TO SURVIVE THE ATMOSPHERE ON VENUS, POISONOUS TO HUMANS. MAY WE BE ALLOWED TO SEE THIS CREATURE ? I ASKED YOU CORRESPONDENTS TO SELECT THREE OF YOUR NUMBER... TO ACCOMPANY COLONEL CALDER TO THE ZOO. THOSE SELECTED BY YOU WILL, OF COURSE, POOL THEIR INTERVIEWS WITH THE ENTIRE PRESS CORPS, AND WE WILL FURNISH YOU ALL NECESSARY PHOTOS. WELL, I GUESS THAT'S ALL, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. [ Chattering ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] SORRY, OLD BOY. MY LINE. JOHN ? GET THIS. [ Trumpets ] [ Trumpets ] [ Labored Breathing ] THE SIZE. EIGHT DAYS AGO, IT WAS ABOU THISTALL. HOW DO YOU ACCOUN FOR ITS ASTONISHING RATE OF GROWTH ? OR IS THAT NORMAL ON VENUS ? NO, IT ISN'T. THE SCIENTISTS HERE BELIEVE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE... HAS UPSE ITS METABOLIC RATE. THE MORE AIR IT BREATHES, THE MORE TISSUE IT BUILDS, THE BIGGER IT GETS. IF YOU'LL FOLLOW ME, PLEASE. YOU'VE UNDOUBTEDLY HEARD OF DR. GERHARD BLANKFOR OF VIENNA, PROBABLY THE WORLD'S TOP MAN IN ANESTHESIA. IT'S THE DOCTOR'S JOB TO KEEP THE CREATURE UNCONSCIOUS... DURING THE EXAMINATION. NOW, YOU'LL NOTE THE WIRE RUNNING DOWN TO THE CREATURE'S WRIST. DR. BLANKFORT KEEPS COURSING THROUGH THE BODY. MORE VOLTAGE, AND IT WOULD DIE. LESS, AND I WOULD AWAKEN. AMAZING. UTTERLY AMAZING. YOU CAN GET A BETTER LOOK AT THE WRIST CONNECTION THIS WAY. THIS IS DR. KOROKU OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO. HE'S ASSISTING DR. UHL. ANOTHER ATTEMP TO PRY SECRETS FROM THE CREATURE, DOCTOR ? WE HOPE THIS ELECTRODYNAMOMETER... WILL ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR EXAMINATION OF AURAL PASSAGES. COULD YOU GIVE US ANY POSITIVE STATEMENT... ON YOUR PROGRESS SO FAR, DOCTOR ? SO FAR, WE HAVE COME TO ONE CONCLUSION. THE CREATURE'S OLFACTORY SYSTEM IS MORE HIGHLY DEVELOPED... THAN ANY KNOWN ON THIS PLANET. YOU'LL FIND DR. UHL ON THE PLATFORM. HE'S THE MAN IN CHARGE. [ Labored Breathing ] SIXTY-SEVEN CC's. CORRECT ? SI, ESATTAMENTE, SESSANTA SETTE. THEY'RE FEEDING THE CREATURE A COMPOUND OF SULFUR. NOW, SULFUR SERVES I AS OUR VITAMINS DO US. GRANDPA, UM, WILL YOU NEED ME ANYMORE ? NO, NO. GRAZIE. YOU CAUGHT ME UNPREPARED. I'VE BEEN COOKING OVER A HOT CREATURE ALL DAY. YOU'RE GETTING LOVELIER EVERY TIME I SEE YOU. OR IS IT THE LIGHTS IN THIS ROOM ? WELL, NEXT TO THAT, I LOOK DANDY. OH, COLONEL. WHEN YOU HAVE A FREE MOMENT, I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE LATES NIGHTMARE I'VE HAD. I'M NOT BUSY FOR THE MOMENT. TELL ME NOW. WELL, IT CONCERNS A DARK CAFE, A SMALL TABLE, A BOTTLE OF WINE-- AND A BURNING CANDLE ? MM-HMM. AND THAT CANDLE'S BURNING LOWER AND LOWER AND LOWER. PRETTY SOON, IT'S GONNA BURN OUT. WELL, MAYBE IF WE HURRY, WE CAN FIND THAT DARK CAFE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. GOOD. NOW DON'T GO AWAY. I WON'T. IF YOU'LL COME OVER HERE, PLEASE. DR. UHL'S EXPECTING YOU. DR. UHL, MAY I PRESEN MISS REYNOLDS-- UNITED PRESS. MR. MAPLES OF REUTERS, MONSIEUR LeGRANDE-- NEWS FRANCE. GLAD TO MEET YOU. HOW DO YOU DO ? GENERAL McINTOSH HAS TOLD US THE IMPORTANCE... OF KNOWING HOW THIS ANIMAL SURVIVES ON VENUS. WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT THE CREATURE'S RESPIRATORY SYSTEM... INCLUDES A FIBROUS FILTERING ELEMEN WHICH BLOCKS OUT... ALL OF THE POISONOUS VAPORS ON VENUS. FORTUNATELY, WE'VE BEEN ABLE... TO DUPLICATE THAT SYSTEM ALMOST EXACTLY. IT'S LIKE A PLASTIC SPONGE. IT IS MADE OF ONE OF THE NEW SYNTHETICS. BY THE WAY, DOCTOR, THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND... THAT GUNFIRE HAS NO EFFEC ON THE BEAST. WHY ? THIS BEAS HAS NO HEART, AND IT HAS NO LUNGS. IT HAS, INSTEAD, A NETWORK OF SMALL TUBES... THROUGHOU ITS ENTIRE BODY. HENCE, FIREARMS EFFECT NO GREAT DAMAGE. YES ? THE DYNAMOMETER'S COMING ON THE PLATFORM NOW. PLEASE, RIGHT OVER HERE. LOOK OUT FOR THOSE ELECTRIC CABLES ! - LOOK OUT ! - [ Shouts In Italian ] OFF THE PLATFORM ! EVERYBODY BACK ! [ Screeches ] COME ON, DOC ! HURRY ! [ Screeching ] [ Screeching ] GET THAT POWER BACK ON ! THIS WAY, COLONEL ! THE POWER'S GONE. EVERYONE OUTSIDE ! FAST ! [ Screeching ] [ Screaming ] MARISA ! MARISA ! [ Man ] COME ON ! HURRY UP NOW !
