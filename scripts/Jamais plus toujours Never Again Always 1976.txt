That's only to scare you. With this package on my hands, I can get more. Well? What have you decided? I think... I'll sign it. I can't go on like this. Adrift. I must leave this behind. Yes. That's right. But do you think going away will help fix things? I don't know. What if things are meant to always go wrong? No doubt I am partially responsible. I don't know anymore. Anyway, there's no need to know why this is like this... That's all. Well, listen, we will talk about all this later. I have to go now. Where did I put my umbrella... You couldn't understand, Agathe. For you it's different. You try to protect yourself. Your tiny armor. You ask for too much. You are always demanding. I brought this for you. I don't want you to forget me. Now that you're going to so far away. You promise me? Claire? Do you recognize me? There's so many things and persons that I don't remember... But you? I recall you. And you look just like I remembered. Five wrinkles more. Mustache. I really like this place. It all seems like a pirate's treasure. All of this reminds me of a shipwreck. It could be stopover too. It's strange to find you here. When did you come back? Last Saturday. You are always a little uninterrupted. Here and there. Are you staying in France? I don't know. I think that I'll leave again. Six years is not that much, nevertheless, I feel like a foreigner in this city. Everything has moved, has changed, The neighborhood, the couples. Friends are gone. Agathe... She is the reason for my trip here. She is my friend. When I hear this breeze it's both of us. Hot air trembling up on the mountain. The square in the evening. In St Basileo. The fountain that came to see me. Remember? You've said that hunderd times, but I have no memory. I don't get attached to my memories. And you? I hope it's better with you. So they were really soldiers? - Yes. Of course. Can you imagine the soldier, in 1914? In love, crafting these shell cases... That will, later on become ashtrays, and flower vases. Little souvenirs. - Exactly, while he received others. Yeah. All this make one dream. Former shell cases, now flowers vases. Look at this one. Probably it has exterminated more than a few men. And one day, it arrives in your room. You put some flower in it, and suddendly it's decorative. You know, I thought a lot about us. About all of this, I mean. Yes. Do you want to come live with me. But we said we wouldn't live together. So we will never fall into the routine. Well, but there's the bad routine and the good one. Most important, one can't get used to the good routine. You follow me? There will never be a routine with you. I can't imagine life without you. Just trying to imagine it... it's impossible. Quick, quick. - 10?

I knew nothing about her. And now it's too late. Why always trying to understand everything? Explaining everything... So wrongly, and so little. A little swan in the mist. here and there. It's her, my lord. Finally! Thank you, god. It is Dona Isabelle on the castle's balcony. Prisoner of these walls, a dear offering, pleasing my eyes, right in front of my feet. Oh, these groves, these rivers, these fields under the moonlight. He's coming. I can hear him, walking down there, in the yard. I was sure it was him. - Do you like it? - Yes. This will be really good. Since we have made a break, Agathe: Attention to your gestures, when you are describing the landscape. It's a bit narrow, try to make it larger. You can go deeper. But that's because I don't have a balcony here. Try anyway. Go ahead... one more time. Oh, these groves, these rivers, These fields under the moonlight. He is coming. I can hear him walking down there, in the yard. Fear no more, milady. It is your servant. Don Pedro. - Who can help you, to leave Castille. Don Pedro has returned! The light for my darkness. Do you see how unhappy and sad I am? I think we have to speed up all this. So the rhythm will be faster. We have to show an idea of urgence. You only have a few minutes to rescue Isabel. You give the impression that you're having a picnic in front of the castle. So... pick it up! Go ahead. Remember? I was really decided to not get this job. And I've made it. I managed to fail. And? And now I am a school teacher. Which can be passionate. But not always. Would you like to come with me to Japan? I expected too much from this departure, 6 years ago. From this rupture. I had thought that everything down there would be different. More simple. I just forgot one detail: Everything comes with us in the luggage. The questions... ...without answers. That's strange. I have the impression of having the same conversation we started a long time ago. I listen to you, and it's like listening to the same bittersweet mood. Yes. I know. It's rather the feeling of having failed. A lack of trust, in everything. I was always afraid of, and I ended up destroying everything. In general, I haven't really improved myself.. Deep inside, we all change so little. And you? What about you? We are only talking about me. Do you still like beef muzzle? What a memory! Your family? Your son? Jacqueline? We don't see each other very often. We are separated... a long time ago. I see her mostly for Alain, problems at school, holidays... We are not really close friends. - Too bad. However, it could be expected. I'm always a bit surprising with separated couples, after years together, nothing is left, no friendship, any kind of tenderness, nothing. It's like it has never happened. As for me, I think we should celebrate the divorce just like we do with the wedding. We would separate as friends. And have a party. There should be divorce anniversaries: ...golden divorces... diamond ones. Parties! Why not? There will be a lot of people I think. It would be great! Excrement. - Garbage. But it's not me saying, it's the local ads journal. You can find anything on it. Two tons of worn out fabrics. Hey! Listen to this one. Couldn't you get down from there? Wait, 1 ton of peas. Anyone is interested? I'd rather want a magical tool, my dear friend. But where the hell is the manual? And who wants 1900 police caps, in an very good shape? No, he prefers things in bad shape. Hey, look what I've found inside your motor. Careless boy. Well, it worked anyway. - Yeah, I see. I should have never solded it. Well, I think this is really exhilarating. What an idea to buy 91 tons of postal bags. You are turning into a man. Oh yes my friend. What do you expect? Can't be a mechanic like you guys. A submarine. A sword. And soon, a motorcycle, in a bad shape. I guess we can say that. What we really need here is some special parts. Yes, exactly. Well, I haven't found that, yet. When I listen to this breeze, it reminds me of both of us. Hot air trembling up in the mountain. The square in the evening. St Basileo. The fountain coming to see me. Remember? I've said that hundred times, I have no memory. I don't get attached to my memories. My only wish is that we could go back to that sweet memory of that summer. Go back to the memory as fresh as that summer. Oh, I keep saying it wrong. If you could go back to that memory, as fresh as that summer. If I want to be at the studio at 3 o'clock I better leave now. Oh, but didn't you tell me we would spend the afternoon together? We can't practice tonight because they will be filming. What time we meet then? Not tonight. Someone is supposed to come by to bring me a text. I don't know how long he will stay. He will surely have a drink. Oh! I'm going to be late. You could still wait a little while. Are you crazy? We have three weeks to get ready. Always like that, last minute things... The little square in the evening. St Basileo. The fountain that came to see me. Yeah! As soon as I finished the play we are going on holidays. I promise. This play is an opportunity for me, you understand? Oh my sweet... It shouldn't be a tragedy. Holiday in Italy, we have the time. All the time. There! Here, an old cigarette. Ok, one can't get addicted with just one. Wait, the light... Breathe in! There you go. You know, it's not bad at all. Yeah. Just a few details, it's not exactly flawless... But what you want? I'm not a manual person. Well, and since you are not an intellectual either... What are you then? You bitch... Watch out your movements, that's the 30th time since this morning. So what? Back to work. Hey, tell me. Don't you think this height a bit silly? Shouldn't it be lower? Like in Japan. So, what you are waiting for? You have a saw. In the kitchen. First the table. Slowly. Here it is. I got it, Here we go! There's no turning back now! Done! That's it. Sold for 250 francs. Now two armchairs, starting at 300. - Ok, wait. That's the furniture. Two armchairs. - 320! - 50! - 350! - 350 francs! - 400! Sold for 550 francs. Next item. Sold for 3200 francs! Motor! And you know what is amazing? Maybe it has filmed movies we saw... That's what I think it's fascinating. No doubt it's a beauty. Yes, no doubt. You know what Phils used to say? - No. Who hates children and animals can't be entirely bad. Impressive. Oh, Buster Keaton. One of the best. Did you see? He is something. Some of the pictures are really beautiful. Look. Orson Wells. Oh yes. I know only a few of the movies here. Cows in the Vincennes Woods. Oh, yeah. And that wasn't a long time ago. Just look at how everything has changed. He is sitting there, just like in front of a spectacle. We don't see many more caretakers in front of their doors like that. But still there's others things to see. I think this is passionate because, it reveals so many things about daily life. An involuntary story appearing on each detail. Soup seller in 'Les Halles'. Interesting, all these anonymous faces. They ask us so many questions. Who could say who really makes the history? He there, carrying water, he has his role. As much as Napoleon III, or Louis XIII. And also I think it's really touching, because it shows life how it is. Static. Frozen. Photography was still something magic. There's suck gravity on their faces. I remember of being overwhelmed at the Museum in Caire. Because of dried plants. Figues, eggs, all from 4000 years ago. Such fragile things, had managed to pass through the centuries. It's even more amazing than the Pyramids, don't you think? They were the news at their time. They obvioulsy were, at least in a way. The cards circulated everywhere. For the first time we could witness the event 'live'. The public was less jaded back then. Yes, everything impressed them. The renting crisis. The bearded lady... The separation of church and state... The war, of course... Yes. It was a kind of TV News. It always impresses me, to see someone I don't know, at the screen, on the News. The involuntary History, as you were saying. We enter into someone's universe. Millions of people staring at him. Just like that. I had a dream about you last night. Hey, can you get me the light? You really want to destroy this relationship? It's Japanese. Don't disturb me anymore. Ok? I had resolved, confessing my remorse before you, to take the long descent towards the dead. I cried out! I felt it coursing through my veins: this poison that Medea brought to Athens. The venon is already working upon my heart. Into this heart, comes a fatal chill... odd. Already, I see nothing but mists and heaven... and the man whom my presence outrages. And death. from mine eyes veiling the light, restoring all that they defiled... all of this purity. Are we going back already? - No, not yet. Me? I have no idea. We will maybe find something else. She had lived and died early. This young Tarentine. Here rests the heart of Etienne Charles. So everyone was buried in common graves? Oh yes, every kind of people. - Does that surprise you? - Yes! First of all we can't forget how things were at that time. A certain panic was in the air, during the summer of 1894. And even among the powerful ones. They were afraid that the Revolution could take their privileges. And afraid of very real dangers, an uprising, an invasion by the Immigration Army. the desintegration of the family, the monetary crisis. Of a massacre. Exactly. Actually it's been only four years since France started to understand. Fair and unfair... they are kind of mixed up. A certain motivation of violence, we take to prison, we kill, all in the name an ideal universal happiness. And we fall on the same trap, on the same contradictions. Myself, for example. I'm sure that I represent for you, the same as a tiran. - Totally. And well... And then we realize how the historical research has changed so much. Questionning everything, passionately. I can imagine you as a young kid, with this same attentive look, this craving for knowledge. this seriousness... Well... We could almost say I was born like that. I got a picture of myself as a baby, naked, laying down. And by then I already had this same serious and lucid gaze. Yes, that's true, I've always wanted to know. Always wanting to go beyond. But it wasn't always easy. But that's it. Here I am. The little History teacher in front of you. Once lost, finally found. I'm ashamed when I listen to you. Everything was always so easy for me, and I have no merit, no merit at all. You've been around the world. Opened youself to other people. Me, I barely know myself. Just my little problems... I'd like to tell you a story. Once upon a time, some years ago, ten years at least, I was quite unhappy with everything, to the point I nearly did something stupid. And then one night, at some friends's place, I met a young woman and I felt immediately close to her. I told her things I had never told anyone else. It was like I will never see her again. But we did see each other again. And then something extraordinary happened... A sort of miracle... When she was gone, because she had to leave, that killed me. I saw things differently. I hadn't noticed. It doesn't matter. It wouldn't have changed a thing. Yes. Maybe. No. I believe in the right moment, and now is the right moment for us to meet. Before it was too early. I wasn't ready. I was too sure of myself. Too much excessive. Had no patience. Just like you were. I'm still like that. on the right. Sold. Now a cane. This cane here with a sculpted man on it. The eyes made of agate. A very good work. For this cane the starting price is 100 frans. How much on the back? Are these the offers? Nobody else? Sold for 320 for that man. Yes my friend, it should be a way of get it. Even with all that it consumes? True, and it's not that clean. - Yeah. It is really bad at first, but it gets better. And it lasts for long. - Hey you, this conversation is of your interest. You have the right, and even the obligation of being part of this. I arrived for your party. But I'm not a girl. Not a boy either. The resignation of parents. - You are right. Only friends can give the family a meaning. Here's some dip. Spoon should be inside. You know, the biggest problem is the interview, in my opinion. Well, but we enjoy it anyway. Yeah, we enjoy it but it's pointless. It's not that simple. - You are right. And it takes a lot of space. I want to keep it anyway. Just tell me one thing, who will take care of him when it will covered with acne? - I will love him the way he is. - Oh, such an overcaring dad you. Oh my, give a good look at these guys. I won't trust them not even my pen. Oh yes, you are right, we are miserables. Me for example, I'm a coward, without any willpower and lazy. Oh, shut up. I am selfish, myope and cruel. That's not like me. I am subtil, distinguished... Is it like that? I am deep and fascinanting. Oh, this kid he looks amazing. I leave this chair. A friend of mine will come take it tomorrow. It's always a bit sad to be the last one. And soon nothing will be left, a film leaves its traces, but a play is over, no more. Yes, but later we will say: oh, how great is the human vanity. You silly... How did you like the practice? - Well, the text is not strong enough. It has to be modified. The writer is alive, unfortunately. We are real buskers. And it's doesn't bother me, this impression, the ephemereal, the temporary. Am I forgetting anything? Yes, I guess you forgot this. How wonderful. I admired it during the whole spectacle. Thank you. It looks like you. Long and flat. When you will have your exams? On tuesday. And I'm not ready at all. As usual. I will think of you. And up there? You leave on Tuesday? Yes. Well, I mean, Goodbye. Work well. You never stop? You know, we need to set some practical goals, that's essential, otherwise we will be better dead. I'm waiting for you. We have a lot to catch up. A lot to say to each other. Don't take too long. Sometimes, when I look at you, I feel extremely touched. I try to understand why. That's my pathetic side. I think what I feel is all of your sides. So violently. Coming to me, from so far away. From so close. For the first time I have the impression, the impression I'm somehow landing somewhere. timing: depositio translation: mortauxvaches
