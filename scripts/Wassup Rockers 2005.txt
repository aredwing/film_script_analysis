The first time I did, she was mad. You remember my girlfriend the sixth grade? He invited me to his house after school. I went to his house. Not planned to do it ... ...

But then you knew that get her wet ... ... Before you take it. My brother told me. " And then I heard his sister speak and thought that would come. So I hid behind the door naked ... ... And she kept looking at me and ashamed. I took the door key and returned to bed under the covers ... ... And started making it again. And then I heard the gate open ... ... And asked: "Did you hear that?". She said: "Yes, my dad." And to hear that I ran away. I jumped the fence to the neighbor's house ... ... And I walked. I think his father saw me. And then went home and thought to call it ... ... But I was ashamed and did not go to school for two weeks for that. And when I went to school and saw her, only said "hello." - Do not worry, Bola Sperm. - It's Milton, silly. "Milton? I do not want to call me Sperm Ball. My name is Milton. Okay ... Sperm ... Ball.

And I did not pay attention, and I saw had pornography in his hand. And I was about 11 years. He was 12, silly. Never mind, I was a kid and very pale ... ... And because he had a strange hair that day - It was an African. - His semen was red? - Yes, all red! He did not know his name ... ... So we call sperm ball. I asked him to call me "Shake."
