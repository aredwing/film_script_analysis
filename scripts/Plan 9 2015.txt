And now, for the first time, we're going to bring you the full story of what will happen on that fateful day. The incidents. The places. We cannot keep this a secret any longer. My friend, can your heart stand the shocking facts about grave... cut. -Stop? Really? -Fuck. Fuck. I gave you five perfect takes, what do you want from me? Let's start with talent, Criswell. Stop calling me that, that's not my name. No, on this set, it is your name. All right? We talked about this. Go check your contract. Yes, my contract. Listen to me for a minute, -it could be fun... -No. Criswell, this has been done hundreds of times. All right, you gotta give them something more. You gotta give them something they normally wouldn't see in a remake. Newsflash, bubby. Remakes are overplayed. They're overdone. 99.9% of them suck donkey balls. I don't know why anyone in their right mind would remake this movie anyway. -It's... -One hour till deadline. Please. Criswell... For the love of everything that is good and holy, just please... Care. Look, this could be your last chance in getting back on top. Let me tell you something, you spineless dog dick. I... have fallen. My current surroundings and present company prove this. Get the fuck away from me. You've been in the business all for about two days. So it's probably not clear, but have no fear. I, your Criswell, shall clarify. It's this face that you're banking your career on. Stop pissing it off. Yes, we have the potential to become a Phoenix from the ashes of this Turkey, but not if you're spinning me on a thousand takes. Why don't we get something... Something in the can. We'll look at it, in the dailies, and if we'll fix it, we'll fix it. Otherwise, I'll walk, you can find yourself another Criswell to carry your shit. Now get behind that camera and call fucking "action." Can I get you anything else, Mr. Criswell? A gun. 20 years of my life back. Shot of rum will suffice. Are you ready, Mr. Criswell? I was born ready, let's shoot this fucker. Lights. Camera. Action. A greetings my friends. We're all interested in the future. Because that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives. Lucy, do you really have to go to work now? Yeah, grandpa. I'm not ready to feel it all yet. Best to keep busy. She was so proud of you. I can't do this now. I need to forget until I'm ready to feel. Lucy, come home. The lab needs me. I'll be home in the morning. Looks like we're just gonna beat nightfall. Better radio it in. Yeah, Roger that. Coast to Nilbog, come in. That you, Danny? Yeah, Mac. It's us. Hot damn. Welcome home, boys. How long you been out there? Months, man. Ready to bring her in. Here that, Danny boy. There ain't been a plane in all... for fuck's sake. My god. Jeff, the time is now. The end of my life! God. Hey, Edith. You okay? I... That'll change your whole day. Jeff, she's... Wettish. Mac, this is Jeff Trent. There's a large meteor headed your way right now. What? A meteor. You have to warn the people. Right on the show, Jeff? Look, I saw it with my own eyes. Kelton. I want you and Larry to go out to the airport see if there's... seems to be some kinda sighting of a meteor landing somewhere in town. Badass. You mean, you don't know where it landed? No, it's just a sighting. Nonetheless, Kelton, see if there's something to it. Hey, chief. What's that? Nobody likes you, Larry. This is boss man Mike, on the mic. Welcome back to "The Backflash." The looking back, looking forward show. Solid oldies, covered by solid bands. We're gonna be broadcasted all night long this Halloween night. Let me ask you ghouls and goblins out there in spookville, how you doing this Halloween night? You having a good time? Boss man Mike is. I'm gonna play you one of my favorite ditties right now so that you can go out and collect your treat in beats. Lucy? What are you doing here? You've had a loss in your family, you deserve to take some time off. No, I'd rather just work through it, you know? Plus, I've always loved the graveyard shift. Are you sure? Yes. I'll be fine. All right. Well, if you change your mind. You know, you just power things down and lock up. Thank you. And... The biolab is overflowing with cadavers, so we're keeping this one for Saturday's experiment. Not a problem. If he wakes up, he can help. Enjoy your evening. See you in morn. How the hell are you, boy? -Mac! -Man. Mac. With the stinkies. You know. -You sure you didn't see anything? -No, man. I throw on the radio, nobody hit either. I called for the police, just like you said. They should be here any sec. We definitely saw it. Made Edith piss herself. Well... Aww. Looks like I better go help her. It's okay, boys, I like a wet one. This is gonna be the greatest day ever. Jeff, you're missing it. The show. Mac... Here comes 5-0. Lovely. You can report it. And then the sweet embrace of alcohol. I was gonna ask Edith to join, but I don't really want a wet one. Jeff. Danny. Nilbog's finest. Larry, how's life behind a shield? So you saw a meteor? Yeah. Right before we landed. You see where it hit? No. Well, I guess if there's no point in impact... There's no sense in taking the man power out and going out searching for it. If it did any damage, somebody will let us know. What did it look like? Like a meteor. So no description then? Listen, why don't you go back to the station and send somebody out who's gonna take this seriously? Jeff, I know how to do my job. I seriously doubt that. All right, okay. We have your statements. We'll report to the chief. It will be in his hands now. You guys can call in in the morning for an update, if you'd like. Yeah. That'll be fun. Okay, great. So we'll be on our way. Right, officer Kelton? All right. Well, then... Man, why do you gotta hassle a guy like that? Because they make fun of us, Larry. They're fucking city dicks. There's no meteor out there. They just want us out in the shit and the mud all night, while they're sitting in some bar, laughing. Well. So... Coming drinking with us tonight? No. I gotta get back to Paula. What? Why? Haven't you seen enough of that woman yet? You've been married for like three months. Yeah, and I've been in the air for the last two. I'll see you later, Dan. All right. -Ready? -Well, Mac. Looks like it's just you and me. Let's find out where we're gonna go throw up tonight. Arr... Boo. How you holding up, luce? I'm good. You got the figures? I'm sending them right now. Listen, I'm sorry about your grandmother. Thank you, Alice. Are these numbers right? That they are. Apparently splitting a photon causes a much larger reaction. This is astounding. Yeah. We're really on to something here. But we have to keep it quiet. We have to keep it secret. If professor Robertson finds out what we're doing on the side, he'll have us both exiled from the profession. Once we run a test, he can do whatever he wants. We'll have all the data we need to approach the board. You gonna run a test there? In a couple of days. Montana is very scarce. Just gotta find a locale. Don't forget to tape it. What? You have no faith in me? None whatsoever. Shit, head honcho's coming. I gotta go. Stay in touch. Hey, Jimmy. Hey. You gonna talk to them again? Yeah, just doing our daily duty. Hey hey hey hey. Calm down. Calm down. -Relax. -What? Calm down. You guys know better than this. Can't be acting up like this all the time. We can't keep coming out here. -Go suck an egg. -Hey hey hey. All right, that's enough. Where's your dad? Where's your dad? Just get inside. He's inside? You go show me where he is. Larry, I wanna go home. Just come on. I just... I wanna go home. Hey. You okay, squirt? Yeah. When you fall, you don't have to be scared. What? Your boys are causing quite a ruckus again, Jamie. I'll talk to them. Yeah, but do you think maybe you could talk some sense into them this time. We don't want to have to come back. And lock anybody up again. I understand. All right. You have a good day then. Let's go, fellas. We should tell them what is coming. It's not our place. Tonight, they'll come. Jeff, you're home. Feeling a bit mushy, are we? Very mushy. Listen, we're on our way, we'll be be there in five minutes. Okay, stay inside until then. I understand that. Stay inside. All righty, looks like I'm done here. Hey, what do you say, babe? Wanna go get some grub? Here you go. Steak. Can't afford steak. She said she saw Clyde Campbell. That old lady's losing her marbles. Clyde Campbell? He died almost a week ago. What? For Christ sake, I was at his funeral. She swears it was him. Up and about, trying to get into the house. So you think we should take her up to the clinic? Lieutenant Harper, please stop pointing your firearm at me. Sorry. You always do that. But to answer your question, yes. If the old broad is seeing dead people, we gotta get her someplace where there's a little bit more padding. This is boss man Mike on the mic. I've been getting some distressing phone calls this hallow's Eve. Now I don't know if you cats are playing tricks on the old boss, but... hello, you're on the mic with Mike who's call... they're in my house! Tell you what, ghouls and goblins, sounds like y'all are really having a blast out there this Halloween. Some of these pranks are really starting to scare the ol' boss man, though. Tell you what, let's calm things down a little bit. Let's get into another ditty. And also don't forget, for the finest one-eye burger on the river, come on down to the Nilbog food-hut. And don't forget to ask for Sally's special sauce. Enjoy the song. That's nice. Hey, what's wrong? You hungry? No. A little sleepy. Well, I'm gonna make myself some eggs. If you wake up, come to the kitchen and join me. We gotta cross a graveyard? No. You stay with the car, I'll take care of it. I'll be right back. Damn, he's... whoa. What the fuck? Lucy, what the fuck are you doing? Lucy, you jump out in front of my car. Nearly killing you and me. Now you've got me in Robertson's laboratory without telling me why. In fact, I'm done. This is quiet time. You have five seconds to tell me why I'm not arresting you right now. I believe we have a very huge problem. One of lab's field sensors has just detected some kind of kinetic energy pulse that may very well kill any living thing it touches. Right... what? Kelton, focus. Based on my readings and calculations, we have about ten minutes until another pulse hits and covers the entire down. -Nifty. -That's bad. -Not nifty. -Remember the whole, "could kill any living thing it touches" part of our conversation. Shit! -You scared me. -I did, didn't I? I couldn't sleep. I'm gonna run down to Sammy's and grab some goodies, okay? I'll be back in 20 minutes. Hey, I love you. Did I tell you I love you tonight? No. I will. Jeff. I want you to leave your job. I know. I know it's a lot of money. But I don't care. You were gone for two whole months. And I was all alone. All I have now is this pillow that smells like you. And since I feel so distant from you, I've resorted to talking to it. Please, baby. If you love me, stay home. You think he'll go for it? More boobs. Jeff. I want you to leave your job. I know, but Lucy seems pretty sure. Thanks, Larry. They're gonna have a hard time believing this. As long as they evacuate the town, it doesn't matter what they believe. -We have to seal this place. -But why? This facility houses a particle physics lab with a lead lining to prevent any wayward particles of electricity from getting out. Hopefully it will work in reverse and prevent something from getting in. -The pulse? -Yes. If my figures are correct, we have less than five minutes until meltdown. Lucy, less big words. This pulse is unlike anything ever charted before. It packs a large amount of kinetic, or moving energy. I believe that the next time it happens, it will reach out even further, causing any living thing it comes in contact with to have a heart attack or something similar. How do you know all this? Back off, man, I'm a scientist. And we're safe in here? I'm not sure. The night can finally begin for you have arrived. How's your victory romp? I believe he's still in between rounds. Right. Come on. What does it take? I need something to help me fall asleep. And forget I ever existed. I told you, I can't sell you alcohol this late. I'm sorry. You smug fuck Nazi. I will shoot you. Did you lock the door? I always lock the door. Jamie! They're in our house. Where are you? Shit. Do you think the lead stopped it? I'm not sure. I felt the wave. Maybe it lessened the strength of the blast. So the whole town is... too early to determine. Dead guy. Somehow I think my calculations were a tad off. Dead guy. Think they're freaked out 'cause of the quake? No, I think they've been drinking. Look at the way they walk. Mac? I think I'm gonna go inside now. Okay, Danny boy. I'm gonna go see if they need an ambulance. Help! Open the door! It's okay, we're alive. -Open the fucking door. -Come on, let's go. Come on! Jesus Christ! No, ma'am. We've got everybody out on call right now. We're gonna get somebody over to you as soon as possible. Hello? Hel... Nilbog PD. Yes, sir. -Yep, we'll be right there. -Nilbog PD. Chief. Kelton's over at the Robertson laboratory with Lucy Grimm. She thinks she's figured out what's going on. Chief? Right. Get Henry, Trevor and Becky on the line, have 'em gear up and meet us at the Robertson lab. We're gonna have to assess this situation and deal with the issues one at a time, people. -Yes, sir. -Get a car. Chief Simpson here. Bitch. -Hey. -What would you have me do? Let them in here to kill us all? You saw what they did to that guy out there. -Fuck you. -Hey, hey, calm down, Jeff. All right. Got more of our buddies out there dancing. I need to get to Paula. They look... this is the boss man... wbog. With this some words of advice. I've spoken to the local heroes at the police department, and they have told me to advise you to go home and lock up. Apparently this Halloween spirit is really gotten crazy out there and people are getting nuts. It's best to leave them alone. Lock up until this thing blows over. Boss man Mike will be here keeping you advised all night. On what's going on out there. But for now, we are going to cut back to another oldie looking forward to getting you flight to foot back to the homestead... WBOG. Help me! Ridiculous. Doesn't make any sense. What the hell would cause those men to go rabid like that? Open your eyes. They ain't people. Okay, Jimmy. You got the floor now. Justin and I were at the graveyard when it happened. Their hands. That was the first thing we saw coming up, out the of the ground. Then we saw their eyes. And they saw us. They're not just from the graveyard either. Tons of them came charging out of the hospital over on Winchester. This isn't a horror movie, boys. Trust me. I know. People don't crawl out of their graves and reek havoc. It's overplayed anyway. No, the boys are right. That's John swails out there. We buried him three weeks ago. And I'm pretty sure he was dead when we did it. He doesn't look dead now. No, he doesn't. The phones are down. The only thing on the radio is boss man Mike. He says we should lock ourselves inside and stay away from them. Wait a minute. In the movies... When you get bit by a zombie, you become a zombie. -Enough said. -No, no. -Let's hear another theory? -Hey hey hey hey! Hey, stop! Come on, Jimmy. Now we're all scared. Okay, we have no idea what we're dealing with out there. But I'm pretty sure we're not dealing with some zombies from the movies, agreed? Agreed? I read a book, telling me how to deal with these... Things. If there was ever an outbreak. Now, I'm not sure what number it was but I'm pretty sure it was close to the number one rule, not to let your bitten friends live. It was just a book, Jimmy. Let's not go killing each other just yet. Until we figure out what we're dealing with, okay? Okay? Everything... Seems wrong. We need a plan. That's right, a plan. Evacuation should be one of the steps. So we wait for them to get here and figure out what to do. -We need protection. -Protection? In case some of them get in. -How many are out there? -Not sure. How many corpses with intact hearts are in town? -What? -Never mind, I'll explain later. We need all the ammo and weaponry you have in your car. -You mean, going outside? -That would be where the car is, yes. Help me, help me! Somebody! Stop! Whoa! What the fuck, Paula? Move it, let's move it. Let's move it back. Go, go! We can't stay here. And why the hell not? We have food. We have power. And how long after we go outside that door do we become zombies fodder? Not to say they're zombies. There's no other word I can think of for them at the moment. He's right. Where the hell are we gonna go? Well eventually they're gonna find their way in. So we either try to find somewhere safer to go, or we just wait for them to get in. Jeff's right. Maybe we can find someplace that they're not at. We can't see zombies, zombies can't see us, right? It's okay. Mom is in a better place now. She told us to run, and that's what we did. They tore her apart, Jimmy. Hey... Hey! You listen to me. I will not let anything happen to you, do you understand me? You are not going to die. You're not gonna die. Well, what about dad? The phone lines are down. I'm sure he's fine. Our house is nowhere near the hospital or cemetery. Hey... He's probably gonna sleep through this whole thing. And even if he was awake, he'd want us to keep moving. We promised mom, right? It's time to be brave. We're with you, Jeff. We stay, we die. Here are the keys to my car over at the gas and sip. It should fit all of us. Thank you. Just make sure me and my em are safe. We will. Hey, it's gonna be okay, squirt. It's for burglars. Big ones. Figured it might help. Well, the front's no good. Let's try around back. I'll come with you and check it out. Jimmy, you keep an eye on everyone while we're gone, okay? Okay. So going outside. Plan still hasn't changed. -So far I'm liking the plan. -Shut up, Kelton. Kink in the plan. Well, at least they're the slow... shit. What are you doing, get inside? Just... Close that door and lock up. We don't want them busting through there and getting in. We gotta keep the place clean. And... just the lock... okay, you can't hear me anymore. That's all right, okay. All right, you're an action hero. You're a fucking action hero. Come on. Do work. I got 'em. Nice to see you alive. -Are you okay? -We have to find Jeff. He went to Sammy's. Okay, go inside. We'll make a plan. Chief, are you good? This about oughta do it. Inside. Sir. Awful dark in here, Sammy. Yeah, the light bulb busted and I didn't get a chance to fix it. Hey, I think I found the door. -Yeah, that's it. -Open on three? Ready. Right. One... shit, Sammy. What do we do? We gotta keep moving. First Mac, now Sammy... I don't know how much more of this shit I can take. Hey, I got two questions. How did that thing get in here? And is there a clear path to that woman's car? Okay. I'll look out. You make sure we don't get blitzed again. -Okay. -Okay. Fuck. They're destroying the whole town. Where's Henry? He didn't make it. Those fucks got 'em. All right, understand. Did you hear me? I said, they fucking got Henry. Becky, you're a cop. Serve and protect. Come on. I want you to keep an eye out and you're gonna radio me if you see anything. If you see anything, no judgment calls, you radio to me. -You got that? -Yes, chief. All right. Why are you locking the door? There's nothing good on the other side. They got Sammy. Let's get back to the others. Right. Everything here is bad. I'm not gonna fucking die, tonight. So, Lucy, what's going on? And the spotlight's on me. Okay. Been bored during rendering, helps keep me sane. Not important. I have worked out eight drafts before this. And the variables seem to rule them all out. So my ninth plan seems flawless and is what I believe to be true. Shortly after dusk, a centralized hub of an unknown form of kinetic energy formed here. After its formation, it sent out a shockwave or pulse of the energy. I thought that the energy in this wave would cause any living thing it came in contact with to have a heart attack. Because it's waveform is so similar to that seen on an EKG. Or heart monitor for those of you not in the medical field, I was sure it would stop someone's heart. I was wrong. Instead, only recently dead humans seemed to be affected by the energy. And to make matters worse, these recently dead humans are being controlled. And you came up with this... from data I gathered. And stories from your people. One. Not every dead thing has been seen walking the streets. Only humans who seemed to have died within the last month have been seen. Two. The living dead are focused only on exterminating living, human beings. They don't harm each other or do anything else that doesn't result in killing someone, thus they are being controlled. The only logical conclusion is that the energy wave is causing this to do that. The energy must be very well manipulated and structured. A code within the pulse that embeds itself in the deceased's body, giving it instructions and an agenda. Something way beyond anything mankind is capable of. Or at least that I'm aware of. Mankind? Yes. Whatever did this, it's not from here. -Japan. -Kelton, think up. There was a meteor sighting earlier today by Jeff Trent, but we had no reports of it landing anywhere. X factor filled. It landed here. Now because it's waveform is so similar to that seen on an EKG. I am positive that the resurrected are being controlled through their hearts by the central hub here. Similar to how our own nervous system controls our bodies. That's why only the recently dead have been seen. Their hearts need to be intact in order for the energy to work. If you've damaged the heart enough, you sever the link. Okay. So shoot 'em in the heart. Indeed. For the bigger problem, we need a much better solution. what bigger problem? A few hours ago, there was a second blast of kinetic energy. I was able to calculate the time it seemed to take for the central hub or nervous system, to charge up for another wave. The second wave traveled four times the distance of the first wave. The dark side of this tale is that this is only the beginning. The second wave reached the river surrounding the town of Nilbog. And there will be a third wave. Perhaps many more. I'm guessing that once again, the third wave will travel four times the distance of the second wave. Luckily it won't reach the neighboring towns. I think this will continue until it travels the entire planet. -What? No way. -Way. This alien nervous system was sent here for a reason. Extermination of mankind. I need a bigger gun. The third wave, now what happens to all the people the zombies just killed? If their hearts are still intact, they will rise to join them. I need two bigger guns. The important fact is that we have 20 minutes before the next pulse hits. All right, so here's our problem. Somehow those things got into the back room. That's where they got Sammy. It won't be long until they get in the front. So what you're saying is we're all going to die. Quiet. Someone important is talking. Look, I don't know. Best thing I can think to do is... To arm ourselves and fight our way through them when they come in. But what about my daughter? I don't know. Just keep her hidden. I'm sorry. All right, let's arm ourselves the best way we can, okay? Hey, you'll be okay. I just need to know if Paula's okay. She was all alone when I left her. I'm sure she's gonna be all right, man. Danny, we live next to a graveyard. It's gonna be okay. Well, what a shitty day this turned out to be. I have to ask, I still don't see how you know all this, Lucy. It just so happens that I'm a genius. Particle physics and electromagnetic spectroscopy are my primary points of interest. What are the chances of that. About 23.5 million to one. So we destroy the central hub and stop the wave from spreading past the town's borders. Yes, that should do it. Now how to destroy it is behind me. I would guess it would be prepared for such an attack, given that everything it appears to be doing is so perfectly planned and organized. You mentioned that this energy wave could have killed everyone with a heart attack. Why not just do that instead of this resurrecting thing? My guess is that it only wants some species dead. Not all. It would need a food source if it were to conquer. From the looks of it, it's down near the abandoned elementary school. Damn. Here, baby... Take some of these. Got your favorite juice for you. No, no. Don't chew. Just swallow. That's a good girl. Just like when you had that cold at grandma's house. Here. One more. What a big girl. That's my baby. The next pulse will hit within the next five minutes. Well, then, let's get ready to go in three. Do you know how to use this? Pull the trigger and send out a fraction of lead. Causing pain and if you're lucky, death. And I don't want one. You're a strange girl, Lucy. My grandmother was buried today. My god, you're right. I'm sorry, I'm... Are you okay? In all commotion, I never called my grandfather to see if he was okay. He would have been within the first blast. But I just kept working. I knew his chances of survival were... let's move out. Well, what's done is done. I just have a problem with hiding from my feelings. But he might still be out there alive. Not likely. He's probably just still out there. -Hey, Kelton. -Yeah, Larry? We're gonna go blow up something alien to stop the dead from rising from the graves. Yep. Just had to say it out loud. Jeff, hurry. What did you do? What did you do? What did you do?! I thought it was the right thing to do. Come on, kid. Come on, kid. Come on. Come on. Hey. Hey. Everything's gonna be okay now. Poor kid. Here they come. Move. The hell... This is gonna complicate things. I saved her. You killed your daughter. You didn't save her. You killed her. No good. No, Becky. Bulletproof glass. Ricochets hit us. That's new. The ones who were alive before the first wave just got smarter. On the other side of the laboratory, there's a sewer. You should be able to use it to get to the school. Larry, what the fuck are you thinking? We make a hold. Give the rest of you guys time to get to the sewer. That's suicide. We stay here, we all die. He would be right on that. You ready? No. Sir, the general has landed. Colonel. This is your team. Roy... horner... Stark... Lester... And of course, cap. He's the only one here who's seen this before so he'll be number two. You have your orders. The town has been quarantined. So you can move quickly without detection. We will hold the front line. You have three hours. Go. Well, Sammy's awake. Jeff. What do we do now? I have to agree with our blood-speckled young friend over there. I've seen enough. Crazy naked lady was enough to kill any doubt I had. What do we do now? Take as many down with us as we can. I guess if that's the way it has to be. New problem. If Sammy's awake... She was... Jeff... I know. I think they're might be another option. Sammy made some friends. What's your idea? That lady said her car was on the other side of the gas and sip. -Right? -Yeah. -I think I can get us over there. -How? Those things are everywhere outside. The cooler. The cooler? Sammy had a door to the outside put in there for deliveries. Those things might not know it's there. It's worth a shot. What do you think guys, you up for it? It's better than we all get fucked inside plan, yeah. What about you? I didn't... what the hell's going on out there? That's the beginning of something that's much worse. It is our time to say goodbye. No no no. No crazy talk out of you two. You do not know what's going to happen. And you do not know the future. There's some things out here and they're killing people. And we don't have time to debate whether you have a superpower. We told you they would come. Fuck this. I'm outta here. I can make it. This ain't the first time they been here. -You okay, man? -Yeah, my face is numb, I can't see anything. Shit. I feel... I was not properly informed on what the fuck is happening here. Who knew they could do that? That wasn't one of them. That was something else. Else? Something else? Fuck. Are you okay? Did you seriously just ask me that? What the fuck? Identify yourself. It doesn't bleed like us or the zombies. Is that orange? Well, if it bleeds... How far to the mark? Four klicks north. Any signs? No, sir. Fun time. Here they come. You know, I find it amazing these goddamn things don't give you the creeps. It's the other ones you gotta worry about. That's enough chatter. Lock and load. Let's spread hate and vacate. Clear. Poor bastards never stood a chance. Cap, we've all taken down the dead before in one e. T. But you've been inside. How did you guys destroy the fucking thing? Well, for starters, we weren't talking. Roy, snap to. -Anything on the mark? -No, sir. Just drones. Calling in this many drones -has to get someone's attention. -Agreed. Move out. You sure you're okay? Yeah. I can see well enough. We gotta keep moving. Nothing could possibly go wrong. All right. Everybody, take a breather. So go ahead and take point. Becky, you take the back. Stopping doesn't seem wise, Kelton. Death would be the only outcome. Hang on, to your pants, I've got an idea. I'm gonna try to reach the military or... Fuck, anyone. This is officer Kelton of the Nilbog PD. If anyone's out there, please answer. I repeat, this is officer Kelton of the Nilbog PD. If anybody's out there. Please, answer. I repeat, this is officer Kelton of the Nilbog PD. If anyone... hey... This is officer Kelton of the Nilbog PD. Hello? -If anybody's out there... -Hello? Right, Sammy used to listen to the police talk. He said it was his gossip channel. Too bad the stupid bastard somehow forgot it was here. Hey, Kelton. This is Danny. You believe we saw a meteor now? Is that Danny? -Ask him if he's seen Jeff. -Paula? Jeff. -You okay, baby? -Yes. Yes, I'm okay. Kelton and some police officers are taking care of me. We're stuck here at Sammy's. We're in a sewer. I don't know who got the better deal. Listen. We're headed to the source of the wave. To destroy it. Okay. The old school on pine ave. You know it? Yeah. Listen, baby, I don't know if I'm gonna get a chance to tell you this again. Paula Trent, I love you. I love you. -Kelton, can you hear me? -I'm here. Listen, I know you and I never really got along, but I'm gonna ask you something right now. Go ahead. I need you to look after my girl, I'm begging you, you keep my Paula alive, okay? I will. And, Jeff. Yeah? I'm sorry I didn't believe you. Jeff? Yeah, baby? I'm so scared. Jeff, that battery's about to die. Listen, baby, I don't have a lot of time right now, okay? No, no. Please, don't go. Listen, I'm sorry, baby. It's the battery. I think it's gonna die any second. So much for the radio. You know we're in a store. We have batteries. She's alive. Yeah, she is. But we gotta get moving, man. What happens if they take over the whole world? We take it back. I was thinking. -These aliens... -Aliens? What else do you know that bleeds orange? You think they will be protecting this central hub? Most likely. You better learn how to use their gun then. Another Halloween gag? Shane? -Justin! -Hey, hey. Justin! It's okay. This'll stop them. -There's nothing you can do. -No! There's nothing you can do. Justin. Stop! Working is not what the car is doing. We've gotta slow 'em down. Hey, hey. The cavalry. Wait. Hey. It's okay. We're alive! All right, talk to me, what are we doing? Stick to the plan. Right. -My god! -Run run run. -Son of a bitch! -Becky, we are leaving. No one leaves this sector alive. I didn't sign on to kill innocent people. You'll do what you're ordered to do, soldier. Move out. Boss man, here. Not sure how many of you are still listening to me out there. But I just want you all to hang in there. And stay safe. I've been told by the authorities, do not head over to Eddie's diner any more. Do not head over to Eddie's diner. They're not letting anyone else in. They've had some big problems over there. Go to your homes, lock up and stay safe. And... boss man Mike... now look, Jamie please. Now look, I know we have not been the best of families. But I can fix it. And I can fix us. Come on, I'm not ready yet. Everything is gonna be all right. Holy shit. Engage. -Kelton... -Yeah. You have a laser gun. I have a laser gun. I have a laser gun. Stark, Roy. Take the drones. Horner, cover fire. Nope. It's all right, you're all safe. Colonel, he just saved our ass. Stark, you disobey me again and I'll kill you myself. Now, raise your weapon and assume cover position. I didn't sign up for this, sir. Get down! Edith? What's going on here? These are the only people left in town that I could find. We're heading across the bridge to the military. They have this whole town sealed off and they've got posts up and down this river. -They're shooting anyone that tries to cross it. -What? I guess they don't want to take chances that... that we're one of them. Or there could be another answer to your riddle. What I'm saying is, what if they knew you were alive and were attempting to contain what they believe is a contamination area. We don't have time for conspiracy theories. People are dying. Are you sure it's okay to just cross this bridge? -Hey, guys, this one works. -Perfect. But we're not taking any more survivors, it's too dangerous. It's time to cross. Wait a second, are you leading these people? They needed somebody. I understand, but maybe you should think about this. I have. We cross now. This is a mistake, missy. But maybe they know what they're doing. God, I don't like this. I said, fire. It's okay. I don't think they're gonna shoot us? Fire. No! Get back. Go! Go! What the hell's going on back there? We've... We've been here a long time. -Stark. Stand down. -I can't do that, sir. We are on a mission, soldier. You're just wasting time. I will not kill innocent people, sir. Enough of this. Where do you stand, horner? Somebody has to be alive to carry out the mission. The next shockwave will hit within the hour. Jeff. My god. We need to see this through. Jeff, no. -What are you doing? -We can help. -Nope. -What? Jeff, I'm not a smart man. Okay, I know just enough to get by. That's about it. You have been working the entire night trying to get to this girl, you finally have her, and now you wanna take her back into immediate danger, just to see if you guys'll make it out okay? -We can help. -No. You can't. Your part in this story is over. You got the girl, in the middle of a world ending event. Both of you should be dead. Very dead. But you're not, it couldn't be any clearer than that. -No, I... -you did your job. You're the hero. Now take your wife, and find a safe place. You're a good man, Jeff. Don't get stupid on me. Thanks. So you're not gonna kill us? It's not my mission. But until we get the threat neutralized. I would recommend not sticking your head out of town. No. We've seen first hand what our government's policy towards that kind of threat is. Okay, listen up. Since we're down a man or two, I need all your help killing all the bad guys. So if you've got the guts, pick up a weapon and follow. You wanna come kill some aliens? Yup. Come on. Let's go finish the third act. What's in there? We don't know exactly. Captain's the only one that's been in there. He took off his clothes and went after a hostel. I've seen this recently. That is a trademark of the insane. Captain came through here all right. Professor. Lucy. -Get out of here. -We're gonna get you out. -They're after you. -What? The project you were working on. The solaranite project. How did you know about my photon fission research? We don't have time for this. Splitting a photon. It's not the same as splitting an atom. Its... its power is enormous. And they fear it. It's... it's too strong of a weapon for us to have. We can't control it. My god. I didn't know. You... you have to get out of here. This is all my fault. Everything's bad. Everything's bad. And why aren't they killing us? Captain. You shouldn't breathe this stuff in. You don't belong here. Bye, captain. The gas, it's starting to burn. I killed the guy who was making the gas. I know, I saw. Stark just went that way after the naked guy. Shouldn't we go after Lucy? -Nice knowing you. -Yeah. Shit! Are you okay? No. When I was jealous, I had this communicator to make my vocals sound into something you can understand. Do not mind him. He knew nothing of you so we silenced him. We learned of you from the old one. You have started a war between my people and yours. I will let none survive. True... We have you now, but soon others will follow your ignorance. So why not skip to the end of your story where you all fall under our feet. Your people do not have the mental capacity to keep up with the technology you develop. You wield weapons above your knowledge and play with them like toys. You are a stupid race. I'm gonna take you back to our home world for interrogation. Everyone is dead because of me. Yeah. That they are. Sorry for the delay. Harper, your face. End of the road, captain. But, sergeant, I'm so glad you're here. My investigation's... hey, hey, hey! I'm getting to it. Jeez. Chatty cathys. What I was trying to say is that my research subjects, they've revealed that they're not too dissimilar from us. Two major points of comparison. One, they don't enjoy having their spinal cords removed from their asshole. And also their forward operating bases, well they also come with a self-destruct mechanism. Theirs just happens to be in the form of a lever in this vat of goo. When activated it will critically overload their ship's power supply. What do you say, sergeant? Roshambo you for it? I'm pretty sure I'm gonna pick gun. More for me. Clarify. He's going to implode the hive that we're standing in? It looks that way. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Dead. No longer breathing. With the exception of whatever that was, they've all looked alike. Do you know why? Seems like they only have two forms of skin to hide behind. Male and female. They probably weren't planning on blending in for very long. We can go now. How do you know everything? They took me from my lab. I'm so glad you're here. Now I can see my son again. We interrupt our programming. This is an national emergency. Important details follow. This is boss man Mike on the mic. Apparently nobody told these things that I was the boss man. Received word that the military is moving away. Apparently the threat has passed, kiddies. They're now on to Montana or someplace like that. Good luck and good riddance to those poor saps. -Alice. -Montana? Exterminate them all. Lucy, I think we're gonna need a new plan. I got one more ditty left in me, this is the boss man Mike saying good night. Hopefully the bedbugs didn't bite. Hey. Hey, man, you okay? They're just letting people out of town this morning. Military's done gone. They stopped shooting us. Damn near lost my ass last night. Had those things all over my camper. The white eyed ones too. Boss man says they're like some sort of zombie leader or something. Killed my dog. Ate my horse. And my wife too. Made it through. God damn, it's good to be alive. Didn't think I would. Since they're using their surroundings and wildlife. Damn. I'm gonna change my ways. I tell you me, last night woke me up. I'm gonna be a better person. Life, man. Living. That's where it's at. You don't look so good. Where do you want me to take you, hospital? Montana, please. Montana? Why do you wanna go to... wait, wait. Boss man said that's where the next zombie attack's gonna be. What the hell are you hitching your way up there for? I lost my ride. Well, you didn't just gain a new one. I just went through the worst night of my life, last night. There is no way in... no way, I'm gonna trek all the way through the gates of hell 'cause you lost your goddamn ride. Montana? That's a whole new kind of war, man. God help us in the future. They come from bowels of hell. A transformed race of walking dead. Zombies guided by a master plan. For complete domination of the earth. Plan 9 from outer space. God help us in the future.
