Count Dracula, monarch of all vampires... ...is dead. But his disciples live on... ...to spread the cult and corrupt the world. Not so fast, please. Not so fast. Easy, there. Steady! What happened? Hang on there. Hang on, my beauties. There is nothing to be scared of, nothing to be afraid of. Mother of God, it's a corpse! I thought you were a corpse. What's the matter? Why have you stopped? Just movin' this log out of the way, miss. It was right in the middle of the road. There, now. Now we can get on our way. Won't take long, miss. We'll make good time now, I promise you. Now, my beauties, let's Get out of here. Come on. Get a move on. Hup! Hup! Good evening, miss. - Welcome to The Running Boar, Frulein. - Thank you. Our menu is simple, but I think you'll find it good. Hot goulash, a dish of sauerkraut and our own red wine from the valley. Will you be eating alone or with the rest of the passengers? Alone, if you please. You see, I am the only passenger, so I must. - What? You're travelling alone? - Yes, to the Academy Badstein. It is not very much further on, is it? I come from Paris and I am due tomorrow at the latest. Look, if you are travelling alone, you better get back to the coach. My lads will have fresh horses between the shafts in a trice. What I mean is You don't want him to go without you. But he won't. The coachman knows I'm here. I know he does, but he will want to get away as soon as possible. Ho! Stop! - What did I tell you? - But he had no right to leave without me. I don't know what right he had or hadn't, he's gone and that's all there is to it. What can we do? Very well. I shall have to stay here tonight. - For the night? You can't. I have no room. - But what else I can do? Johann, go to the farm at once and ask to borrow their cart. Get along with you. Just you sit down here and let me fetch you something good to eat. We'll get you away tonight. - We must. - But... Not having a room, you understand. There. This will put some warmth into you for the journey. - Yes, Johan? - I have got the cart in the back. - Come on, we've no time to lose. - But... Johan is right. You must go. Is that the stagecoach coming back? - Don't open it. - I must. Wine. For your journey - Thanks, but I've already... - Another glass. This Tokaj is the twin brother to the rest of the Emperors cellar. Rather different from the wine of the valley you were drinking. - What a very wild night. - Yes, isn't it? I hope you have not far to go. I am on my way to the Ladies Academy at Badstein. The Lang School? I know it well. But I thought I passed the stagecoach as I came down here. Left me here, I'm afraid. Forgive me but... ...I was wondering if, by any chance, you might be going that way. They can't put me up here and I don't know what to do. If you'll excuse me, my husband was mistaken. We have a room if you want. So you're going to the Langs of Badstein? Yes. I've got my first appointment there as a student teacher. I start tomorrow and I did not want to give a bad impression by arriving late. You needn't do that. I can't take you over tonight... ...but I shall see that you get there early in the morning. Meantime, you cannot stay in a poor place like this. - There is nowhere else. - Indeed there is. I'm the Baroness Meinster. My castle is in the hills, just above the village. Please give me the pleasure Of being my guest tonight. - I shall be more than grateful. - Let us waste no more time, then. Come. - You are very kind, Madame. - I'm nothing of the sort. I am a very lonely old woman who often longs... ...for the company of someone with a little breeding. A rare thing in these parts. Let me introduce myself, Madame. My name is Marianne Danielle. Thank you, Mademoiselle Danielle. Greta, this young lady is staying the night with us. See that she is comfortable. We will have dinner in 10 minutes. Can you be ready by then? Yes, Madame. Madame la Baronne is very kind, but still I'm intruding most terribly. I had no idea she was expecting a guest. Nobody is expected. The Baroness always has a second place laid in case somebody should come. And I have come, haven't I? Yes. Ten minutes. Please do not keep Madame waiting. You'll see more by daylight. Madame is waiting. Greta, you said she wasn't expecting anyone. A guest, I mean. But I saw a man on the balcony below. He didn't look like a servant. I am the only servant left at castle Meinster. I felt sure I saw a young man. - Madame is waiting. Are you about ready? - Almost. Aren't you having any soup? I have very little appetite. Greta tells me that you saw someone in the balcony below your room. I thought I did. I thought I saw a man, a young man. - But I must have been wrong. - You were not wrong. You saw my son. - But I thought... - You thought what I wanted you to think. That I was an old woman living here alone. Now you know that I'm not alone. I have a son. - Please, I don't wi... - My son is ill. I'm so very sorry. His illness has destroyed my peace of mind in these last years. You may not believe it, but we've had gay times here. Balls, dinners... - ...life. - I'm sure. People used to come from all over Europe, even from Paris to be my guests... ...until he ruined it all. He ruined it all? How? It hurt me too much not to be able to present my only child to my friends. To have to keep him locked up. Is he ill in his mind? I never see him myself. Greta looks after him. She is his old nurse. - You never see him yourself? - He has made me suffer so appallingly. He has his own rooms apart from the rest of the castle... ...only reached through that door. But all that is nothing. The vital thing is that you discovered its existence... ...and I have explained the situation. But, Madame, are you sure he is happy there? Are madmen happy? Surely something can be done. - Is there no doctor? - We pray for death, he and I. At least, I hope he does. The people around here think he is dead already. So I am told and I encourage that belief. Encourage? I see you are passing judgment on me, my child. Sleep before you pronounce sentence. I am feeling very tired. May I say goodnight? Of course, Madame. Good night. Thank you and may I say... ...God bless you. If only he could. No. Don't do that. Who are you? Who are you? - Why have you come here? - I called to you from my window. I've come to help you, if I can. Help me? Have you? Come here, will you? No, don't be frightened. I want to look at you. You are very beautiful. So you have come to help me, have you? Well, no one can do that, Mademoiselle. No one can do that. I was terrified you were going to throw yourself over the balcony. I assure you I wasn't. I can't. Come closer. Please, come closer. You see, I... I can't come to you. But... it's inhuman! My mother thinks of me as inhuman, doesn't she? I suppose she's told you that I'm mad. That I have to be locked away like this for everybody's sake. Well, why shouldn't she? And why shouldn't you believe her? - I don't know what to believe. - You see, Mademoiselle, this castle... ...the mountains, the dark acres of forest... Even the valley below, belong to me. They are my inheritance. I am Baron Meinster. But my mother is a vicious, evil, jealous woman. She's let people believe that I'm dead. She wants them to think that the castle and the grounds have devolved upon her. They might just as well have done so. I'm more than half dead, already living shut away like this as I am. I mustn't talk like that. I promise to help you. If you confide in me, I'm sure I can. - Only tell me what to do. - Could you...? Could you, I wonder, find the key that fits this. Where does your mother keep it? Greta tells me it's in the locked drawer of the bureau in her bedroom. - That's the room next to yours. - I'll find it. Will you? There are grave risks, you know. - Do you think you dare? - Yes, I dare. - Monsieur Baron. - Yes! Yes! - I have found a key. - Good. Throw it to me. One moment. Now you must get dressed at once and meet me outside, will you? - Yes. - But hurry. Give me back that key. - But, Madame, I... - You have taken a key from my room. Give it back to me. Do you hear me? - I assure you, Madam, I have no key. - You must have it. - Give it to me! Give it to me! - Leave me alone. You haven't taken it to my son? You little fool, you don't know what you have done! - Help me. Help me. - Easy. Don't worry. She can't harm you now. You have nothing to fear. Go to your room and wait there. Mother, come here. No. No, my son. Mother! Come here. Now, mother, come along with me. He's free. He's gone. Oh, my God. He's gone. Oh, God. Oh God, help us. He's free. He's free. Oh God, help us. He's gone. He's gone. He's free. He's Gone. Oh, my God. Oh God, help us. He's free. He's free. He's gone. What's the matter? He's free. The cunning devil. Why was he locked up? He's not mad. No, he's not mad. You know that much, don't you? Who got him the key? Was it you? You? - Did you? - Where is he? Gone. Out into the night. The bats are about. Listen. There's a wolf howling down there. He'll get them all astir, trust him. You don't know what you have done, but I know. Are you mad or what? - Where is Madame la Baronne? - She's not far away. You want to see her? Would you like that? Would you? Look! You needn't be afraid. She's dead. - What have you done? - She's dead and he's free. Don't blame me, mistress. It was none of my doing. No. I've always kept faith with you. Twenty years since I first saw you come to the castle here... ...with the old Baron and your little son. A fine, handsome imp he was, too. But you spoiled him. Oh, yes. He was always self-willed and cruel and you encouraged him. And bad company you kept, too. You used to sit and drink with them, didn't you? Yes, and you laughed at their wicked games. Till in the end, one of them took him and made him what he is. You have done what you could for him since then, God help you. Keeping him here a prisoner, bringing these young girls... ...keeping him alive with their blood. But the powers of darkness are too strong. They've beaten you. He's free. But he'll come back here. That's certain. He'll come back to his old Greta. He'll come back. He's got to come back here before cockcrow. - Carl, let's have the travelling rug, will you? - Yes, sir. Good. Put it around her. - She's not dead, is she? - No. Bad case of shock, I should say. Exhaustion. Now don't worry. How far are we from Badstein? Three or four kilometres. You've been badly frightened, haven't you? But there's nothing to be afraid of now. I am a doctor. Dr. Van Helsing. Now you just sit down here. Landlord? Coffee and cognac, please. - I'm very sorry, sir. - Please, this girl has been unwell. Miss, I am glad to see you safe. I'm afraid we are closed to customers this morning, sir. Father Stepanek booked me a room here. I'm Dr. Van Helsing. - Oh yes, of course. I'm sorry, sir. - I'll go and get you some coffee. There's been a death in the village. Hans's daughter, such a beautiful girl. She was found dead in the forest. - They are holding a wake there now. - How did she die? No one really knows. But she's dead alright. Her father Stepanek is away. They're going to bury her in the churchyard without him. - May I see her? - You could see her, of course. They probably would like you to, being a doctor. But there's nothing that can be done. I won't be long. Wild garlic? Yes, it's supposed to be a protection against evil. Vampires... ...and such. You must humour these local superstitions. After all, who knows how she came by her death? There's usually a good reason for all these old customs. There's her father. - He's a doctor. - I'm so very sorry. She was a good girl. I can't believe she's dead. If only the priest was here. The whole night was like a bad dream. - I can hardly believe it happened. - Then don't talk about it. The Baroness seemed so kind at first. - But her son... - Her son? But... surely he's not still alive? It's such a long story. Do you feel well enough to travel? - Yes. - Goodbye and thank you. - We'll be back later. The next thing I remember was seen you. I am afraid I have put you to a lot of trouble. Not at all. What was the name of this chateau where you stayed? The chateau of Meinster. - Do you know it? - I know all of it. And you are on your way to school for young ladies at Badstein. I am to teach there French and deportment. - I'm sure you'll do very well at both. - Merci. - What about your luggage? - I left it behind at the chateau. - I shall have to send for it. - The chateau Meinster? - I don't think that would be very wise. - But... Please let me explain. I have been asked to make a study of a strange sickness. Sickness partly physical, partly spiritual. And may I know what it is? Have you heard of the "cult of the undead"? - The undead? - Yes. - Have you hear of it? - No. - Are you sure? - Quite sure. It is most prevalent in Transylvania and the Lower Danube. And could it spread? Unless it is stamped out. That's why I'm here. And you can help me. I want you to tell me everything that happened in the chateau Meinster. - But... - Everything, in detail... ...leaving nothing out, however trivial it may seem to you. - Will you do that? - Yes. And when you have told me, I want you to forget it. Forget it completely and never mention it to anyone. - If that is what you wish. - That is a promise? - Yes. - Good. This is Mademoiselle Danielle. She has come to take up her appointment. Will you come in? I'll tell the principal you are here. I'll see to it, Elsa. You must be Marianne Danielle, are you? I'm Frau Lang. - Welcome to the Academy. - Thank you. This is Dr. Van Helsing. - How do you do? - How do you do? He has been kind enough to accompany me from the last village. - Her coach broke down. - There was an accident? You are alright, aren't you, my dear? No bones broken or anything? - Thank you. I'm quite alright. - But she lost all her luggage. How unfortunate. We can fix you up with anything you want until it's retrieved. Come along and meet Herr Lang. He'll have heard you arrive and he doesn't like to be kept waiting. Between you and me, he's rather a stickler. - I must get back to my... - Oh no, please come too, Dr. Van Helsing. You can help explain everything. Mademoiselle is a little late and Herr Lang is so very punctilious. A wonderful man... ...wonderful but just a little terrifying. Now, girls, don't stand there staring. Christina, you'll catch a fly in that mouth if you don't shut it, dear. Let me do the talking. Otto, my love... - ...Mademoiselle has arrived. - So I heard. - Late. - I'm sorry. Mlle., punctuality comes next to cleanliness. - But, Otto, the poor girl... - Excuses, always excuses. I assure you, sir, that this was unavoidable. - And who might you be? - A friend of Mademoiselle's. I've made it a rule, sir, a rule of the Academy. The staff are allowed no followers. No followers. I'm a doctor. Lydon University? Almost a colleague. My dear Dr. Van Helsing, you had only to tell me. Heavens. How could I be expected to recognize... ...a doctor of philosophy, doctor of theology... ...professor of metaphysics by the cut of his trousers? I trust, Herr Lang, that you will allow me to visit Mademoiselle during her stay? My dear doctor, the rule is already rescinded in your favour. Thank you. Now if you'll excuse me. Dear sir, your most obedient servant, always. Come along now, dear. I'll show you your room. Come along now, girls. No more dawdling. You heard what I said. Gina, I shall want you in a moment, dear. How can I thank you enough for your kindness? - By keeping your promise. - I'll try. And don't let that ogre in there frighten you. Please call again whenever you may be passing, doctor. Frau Lang. - Goodbye, Mademoiselle. - Au revoir. Please, I can see myself out. - Such a charming man. - Yes, a kind man. Yes. Gina. She's a student teacher like you. Gina, Mademoiselle has only just arrived and she doesn't know anybody. I want you to show her to her room. - Yes, Frau Lang. - Room number 14. I always feel strange when I arrive in a new place, don't you? You'll settle down. Come along. Why, Father? Why should it happen to her? She was like a mother to her two little sisters. Why should God in his wisdom permit these things? Where is she, my son? Where is she, Hans? You know I must go to her. You're too late, father. She is buried. Where? In the churchyard, where else? In hallowed ground? Well, isn't that the right of every man and woman? May God forgive you. She's dead, isn't she? Why can't she lie in peace like all the rest? Because she is not like all the rest. You know how she died, my son. I know how your heart bleeds but she can't lie there. Please, father. Please let her stay. Even if you can't give her the blessing of our holy Mother Church... ...please let her stay. My son... ...you must pull out of your mind the idea that she ever was your daughter. She is no longer like the living. Not even, God help us, the dead. No. Please drink this. Poor man. - And I am powerless. Powerless! - Perhaps I can help. - Who are you? - You sent for me. - Dr. Van Helsing. - Thank God you've come. Thank God. There. - Will you unpack yourself, sir? - Thank you. What is this... vampirism, should I call it? It's the survival of one of the ancient pagan religions... ...in their struggle against Christianity. And the first I suppose, the vampire? The undead. - And that passes on? - Yes. The vampire, by its kiss, taking the blood from its victim... ...makes it another vampire. So, the cult grows. Infinitely slowly, but it grows. The vampire rests in the day, usually in his tomb... ...issuing as a living form only at night. That means they need the help, the protection... ...of a human being during the hours of daylight. For instance? A mother who may hide an infected son or daughter. Or a servant... ...either hypnotized or so devoted to the master... ...they don't realize the evil they are doing. - A lost soul? - Possibly. If it wasn't for this protection... ...vampires could be tracked down during the day and destroyed. How can they be destroyed? By driving a wooden stake through the heart or by burning. The tormented soul is then released to return to the peace of death. These colonies, such as you have here, must be wiped out. Only then will this bondage of hell be lifted from the world. Are there ways of telling these undead from the living? They are repelled by holy things and Christian images. They are thin. They have an air of hunger about them. - They cast no reflection. - Not in water? - Not in a mirror? - No. And some have the power to transform themselves into bats. - Is that the girl's grave? - Yes, it must be. There's still time. The sun's not down yet. She won't be active until then. Is that sacrilege? No, father. It's, as I told you, an act of healing. She'll be in God's hands again and can lie in consecrated ground. I pray that it may be so. If I don't stop her now, she'll rise again as an undead... ...and a new cycle of evil will begin. Remember, they are my people. I am their priest. Then pray for me. I will, my son. And please... ...will you take this with you? It contains holy water. It may be of service to you. Thank you, Father. Wake up. Wake up. Wake, dear, wake up. It's time to awake you. The master's waiting... ...waiting to see you. Come on, wake up. Wake up. Wake up, my dear. Are you about ready? No, I can't help you. You've got to be strong. What? Yes, I know it's dark, but you've got to push. Yes, push. That's right, push. Now, just one little effort more. You'll soon be here. Come, now. Come, my precious. That's right. Come, my little love. There, the master is waiting. There she is. There she comes. There's my little beauty. A clever one. There's my clever one. Stop! - In the name of the Almighty... - Get away. Get away from here. Go, little one, quickly. - I'll tear your eyes out. - Hurry, my son, before the girl gets away. Who is it that is not afraid? Only God has no fear. - Why do you come here? - To find your son. - Then you know who I am. - I know who you were. - He's escaped? - Yes. You'll never catch him. He's too clever. - He has taken the blood of his own mother. - It was all my own fault. I loved his wildness. I encouraged it. And when this monstrous thing took possession of him... ...I didn't send for a priest or a doctor. I hid him and helped him to live. And now there is no release from this life... ...which isn't life or death. And I know I shall have to do whatever hideous things... ...he asks me to. There is one release. Come in. I am sorry, Frau Lang. I did not know it was you. It's perfectly alright, my dear. I thought I'd better come with the news myself. You know how the girls chatter. - Well, my dear, he's here. - Who? Why haven't you told us you expect him? Luckily, Herr Lang's gone down to the village. I don't know what he'd say if he knew. - But who is...? - Come along, my dear... ...you mustn't keep him waiting. - Monsieur Baron. - See? Didn't I keep it to myself? I wanted so much to meet you again... ...so I took this opportunity of bringing the luggage that you left behind. - I thought that you might need it. - How kind of you. Your mother, Madam la Baronne, is she well? I regret to have to tell you... ...she's dead. Oh dear. Why, I'm sorry. So now you are all alone, up in that great house? - Exactly. - Oh dear. Now Monsieur, I should leave you entirely to yourselves... ...for 10 minutes. Well, Marianne. What are you doing? Keeping an eye on things. Trust me. Keeping an eye on what? - A pair of turtledoves, bless their hearts. - Who? Mademoiselle Danielle and a young man, dear. What? Stop. What do you think you're doing? - Shameless little hussy. - Herr Lang. You know it's a rule, my rule. The staff are allowed no followers. What the devil do you think you are doing here? I was placed here by a most charming lady. In fact, your wife. Don't you try to be impertinent to me, sir... ...or I shall have the privilege of throwing you headfirst out of that window. You'll find it a most interesting way of making my closer acquaintance, Herr Lang... ...but hardly necessary under the circumstances. I've long wanted to meet you, an old and valued tenant. I'm no tenant of yours, you young jackass. - I'm a tenant of the Meinster estate. - Exactly, and I'm Baron Meinster. I must apologize for not having called before... ...but I've been recovering from... ...a long illness. I wouldn't have come today except that I had some pressing business... ...to discuss with Mademoiselle Danielle, who has just consented to become my wife. Wonderful. I shall be grateful if you would allow Mademoiselle to stay here for a few weeks... ...whilst I make arrangements for the wedding. Of course. We should be more than honoured. Oh, yes, indeed. May I take this opportunity of congratulating you and Frau Lang... ...on having the most charming house and grounds. - Mein Herrschaft. - At so low a rent. I'm so proud for you, Marianne. What's it feel like to be a Baroness? Not so fast. We are only engaged. - Isn't he handsome? - I think he is. So he should be marrying you. He's just like I imagined Prince Charming was to look at. So noble... ...and with such wonderful eyes. Such tenderness in them and humour, too. I must be careful, or I'll be falling in love with him myself. I shan't allow that. The toast! - What a terrible smell! - I'm so sorry. Never mind. I'll go down for some more bread. Frau Lang won't mind. I wish it had been me. - Thank heaven you're safe. - Father. What happened to that woman? I'm afraid she got away from me soon after you'd gone. I tried to follow but lost track of her in the dark. - How did you fare? - I went to the chateau. You remember when you wrote to me asking me to come here? You told me of your suspicions about the Baron and his mother. - I do indeed. - They were well founded. The Baroness had become the victim of her own son. - Oh, no. - She's dead now and at peace. God rest her soul. But her son escaped with the girl. My son, we have a great deal to thank you for already... ...but I'm afraid your work is not yet finished. Must be tired. You should have some food. I'll join you presently. Is it well and truly boiling? - Straight out of the kettle, doctor. - Good. That's fine. Might have been chest... ...bronchitis or pneumonia. You never know. Extract of Benzoin. Yes, tincture of myrrh. Only want a drop of that. Just a drop. Yes, liquor of capsicum, plenty of that. Ad lib. Now, my very good woman, the towel. Right, right over my head. Don't you pay any attention to anything I may say. Here we go. My very dear, kind Frau, I can't breathe. You're killing... Mercy. I can't breathe! Very well, there you are. What the devil? I told you not to pay any attention to anything I said. - Let's have another try, shall we? - You see off to yourself, thank you. I've got my living to earn. What we doctors have to put up with. First it's you clericals, father... ...with your monolithic superstitions. Then peasants like her with their troglodyte indifference. Of course, she may have died of heart failure. I mean the heart may have just... ...slowed down and stopped. That's clearly a case for nux vomica. Or perhaps it galloped itself to a standstill. In that case, digital. And of course, always and all the time... ...valerian to quiet my nerves. I wish I haven't drunk you out of house and home. But if the patient is dead, what's the use of all these concoctions? Precaution is better than cure, father. By doing this... ...I have survived a vast number of other people's deaths. I mean to survive a great many more. - But who's dead? - One of the young girls at the Academy. She died quite suddenly in the night. Dr. Tobler, this is Dr. Van Helsing. Are you sure it is one of the pupils and not one of the staff? That I can't say. Doctor, if you're going to see her... ...it would be better for you to take Dr. Van Helsing with you. He's one of the most eminent medical men in Europe. - Would you come for nothing? - Certainly. Splendid. I might put your specialist's fee on my own little account. Worth trying, anyhow. Would that be all right with you? - Why not? - Thank you. Shall we go then? Thank you. - You say the door was locked? - Yes, on the inside... ...but the window was open. - Open? - Yes. We found her lying on the bed. What did she die from? - I'm not sure. - But I must know. Such a thing, if we can't say what it is... - ...might mean ruin for us. - I shall have to make a further examination. Perhaps you and Frau Lang will leave us. What should we make the verdict? Have you ever seen anything like this? - That's a bite, isn't it? - Have you ever seen it before? Very seldom. Once or twice in the forest villages. You know, that's probably a pet animal, a dog or a cat. The villagers fondle 'em, you know. It's a very unhealthy practice. We can't stop 'em. This is the mark of a vampire, sometimes called the seal of Dracula. - See how it cuts through the vein? - A vampire? No, I'm afraid not. Well, the peasants are always going about... ...all about werewolves and vampires. I'm a scientist. - I always laugh at those ridiculous legends. - I shouldn't if I were you. I don't want these people to know it. You'll leave everything to me? By all means, I'll leave everything to you. Except the fee, of course. - Her death was due to a fever. - Yes, a fever. It is very contagious. I've locked the door to her room. Here's the key. What else must we do? The undertakers came this morning. They'll be back again tomorrow. Now listen, these are my instructions. Are there any outbuildings here? - The stables, of course. - Good. Let her lie there in her coffin until the burial. No, Dr. Van Helsing, the poor dear child... Two responsible people... ...must keep watch over the coffin until nightfall. I'll be back by then. In the meantime, you must lock the house, keep all the doors and windows shut... ....and let none of your pupils be alone at any time. - Is that understood? - Of course. We can organize this right away. Excuse us, doctor. Marianne will see you out. Come, Helga. I'm so sorry, my dear. All this upset, so soon after your arrival. But don't let it spoil your personal happiness. - Have you told Dr. Van Helsing? - Helga. Coming, dear. May I have a glass of wine? - Did you have something to tell me? - You have been so kind to me. I would like you to know I am engaged to be married. I'm so very happy for you. Congratulations. - May I know who is the lucky man? - The Baron Meinster. - What? - What is the matter? - He has been here? - Yes. - Did you let him kiss you? Tell me, please. - Only my hand. Why do you do that? - Are you in love with him? - Yes, I am. I see. - Aren't you going to wish me well? - Of course. - When are you seeing him again? - I am not sure. Tomorrow, I hope. - Are you ready, Dr. Tobler? - Of course. Coming. - If only they'd keep quiet. - Saw a poor young lady yonder. No horse can abide a corpse nearby. Marianne! I have come to see if I may relieve you till Dr. Van Helsing comes. Oh, have you really, my dear? How kind of you. I won't say no. Oh dear, I'm almost as jumpy as those poor horses. - Good night, Severin. - Good night, madam. - Thank you again, Marianne. Good night. - Good night. - Admiring the brasses? - You keep them so bright and clean. You know, all these remind me of the seasons of the year. This set here... ...reminds me of spring in the... Picnics, bathing in the streams... - ...drying in the sunshine. - And that? Autumn. Gypsies... ...galloping along grass ridges in the roads... ...fine boys, fine girls. - And this? - Winter. Look at that now. You and I... ...sleep sound in a nice simple coffin of elm or oak. They have to have cedar and all this brasswork. It's locked. This one is tight enough. Severin, will you please go and fetch Herr Lang? - I will if you wish it. - I do wish it. Please. Well then, but I warn you he won't like it. Pay no heed to the horses. Stop, will you? Marianne, my darling Marianne. You haven't forgotten your little Gina? Put your arms around me, please. I want to kiss you, Marianne. Please be kind to me. Say that you forgive me for letting him love me. We can both love him, my darling. He's up at the old mill now. We can go there together. Come with me, Marianne. - Bring some brandy and hot water. - Yes, doctor. Marianne... ...did you see who it was? - It was dreadful. - You know, don't you? She looked exactly like Gina... - ...except... - It was Gina. - But it couldn't have been. She's dead. - Gina is now an undead. She is the third victim since the Baron was set free. - The Baron? You mean the Baron Meinster? - I do. Oh, no. I won't listen to you.... You must know I wouldn't say such a thing unless I was absolutely sure. I've got to find him, Marianne. Do you know where he is? - No. - Where is he, Marianne? If you know, you must tell me. Marianne, where is he? Tell me. The mill. The old windmill. Marianne, wear this rosary. It will protect you. And when I'm gone, I beg you to lock yourself in... ...and answer the door to no one. You must obey me in this. - Look after her. - Yes, doctor. Go on, catch him. Obey your master, take him. Take him! I brought someone to see you, Van Helsing. Beautiful, isn't she? What a pity such beauty was to fade... ...unless we preserve it. She's going to join us, doctor and you are going to watch her initiation. - Marianne, don't look at his eyes. - Marianne, look at me. Marianne!
