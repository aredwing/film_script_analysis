Don't mean to pry, but I can't imagine what a girl like you wants to do at the lots. [INTENSE MUSIC] [GASPS] - Give me some money! [INDISTINCT MUMBLING] [INDISTINCT MUMBLING] - Animals. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [EERIE MUSIC] [CELL PHONE KEYS BEEPING] [PHONE RINGING] - Hello? - Mom. Hi. - You made it? - Yup. - Storm coming tonight. - Yeah, I heard. - Can you put her on? - Julia... she's asleep. - Please, mom. Can you please call her over so I can tell her goodnight? - Julia, don't think about her tonight. - Well, if she wakes up, can you just please tell her that I called? - Okay. - Don't forget. - Focus on yourself. I don't have to remind you that this is your last chance or they'll take Clara away. - Yeah, I know that, mom. - Remember your breathing exercises. - Yeah. - I don't know how many more opportunities you'll get. - Yeah. Yeah, okay, mom. - I gotta go. Alright, bye. [DOORBELL BUZZING] - You're a student, correct? - Yes, sir. I'm gonna become a nurse someday. - Best of luck with all that. Around here, you work in the night shift. 2 guards man every shift. 1 guard on patrol duty, the other on the screens. - Wow. What is this place? - The building was erected during the big boom. Assumption being industry drives growth. Growth brings up demand for more affordable luxury housing. Imagine living in a place providing everything you need for a comfortable life. You'd never have to leave. And as you know, boom became bust, and here we are. - What a waste. - You have to be careful here, Ms. Streak. Things are starting to... fall apart. Ballroom, grand hall, gym mail and storage rooms plus a residential tower, 30 floors high. As a patrol guard, you make sure nobody gets in nobody vandalizes the place, nothing bad happens to the structure... and nobody steals anything. - Does that happen? - All the time. Steal whatever they can get their hands on. We've been having issues of vagrancy, tryin' to make the place into a squat, so don't let anyone in. This job pays well for a reason. The nights here can be long... and dark. Some of the lights are on timer, so they turn off to save on power. The combination can make some people... uneasy. - I like the night. - We've blanketed the entire building with security cameras so we only need two guards. One on patrol and the other.. - In front of the screens. - Got it. Where's the control room? - Upstairs. I see your partner's already here. This is Dennis Cooper. He's been here since day one. - Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Julia, but everybody calls me Streak. - That's great. - Nice. Cooper will take you through the controls. But I think you'll find the system pretty intuitive once you start using it. You'll go on patrol once every two hours. Cooper will communicate with you using this headset. Packs a small camera and a microphone. Show us the feed, Cooper. [KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING] Simple enough? Also, we've been having trouble with electricity. We lose a video feed from time to time so you'll have to throw a breaker. - Got it. - You know what a breaker is? - Yup. - Don't forget the uniform. That is the most important part of this job. - Have a great night. - There is a locker room in the back, to the right if you wanna change there. Unless you feel more comfortable changing in here, which I could probably make an exception for that... tonight. - I'm gonna go to the locker room. - Okay. [DOOR CLOSES] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [THUNDER RUMBLING] - This place is really big. A person could spend a lifetime in here. - Well, most people don't last more than a week. - What's your story? - What's my story? My story. Um, let me see. It's a very long, detailed richly... boring tale. However, let's start with tonight's chapter. I guess it starts out that I'm sick and tired of Dixon wheeling in some.. Local community college brat and expecting me to entertain them all night. That's my story. 'Cause tomorrow or the next day or possibly a week from now but without question, it's going to happen, you're gonna decide that patrolling a big, empty building every two hours is not what was meant for you and your life and big aspirations. You're then gonna quit. Then Dixon's gonna bring in someone who's just like you and gonna sit right in that chair I'm gonna have the same conversation and be forced to babysit that person all night. - Really? - No tips, either. - This is gonna be a long night. - You have no idea. Sorry, sweetheart. Welcome to the big world of security. Excuse me. Time to lock up. Lights out. 2, 3, 4. Ta-da. [GULPING] [BURPS] [CLEARS THROAT] - Gross. - It's weird. That happens every time I try to burp. What are you, 24? 25? 23? Alright, we're just gonna stick with 24 then. - What, are you talking to me now? - Tough. Right? Bet you were a good student. Little teacher's pet. Am I right? Fit. Like your arms. You do a little self-defense maybe? Little karate? Little, uh, tae kwon do? Judo? Jiujitsu? Jell-O wrestling? Pillow fights? [EXHALES HEAVILY] Kickboxing, maybe? - Yeah. Yeah, I do kickboxing. Yup. You have to for this job. - Ho-ho. Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Is that what Dixon told you? I must've missed that one. I can't kickbox. Guess what? You don't. I don't think I've seen one of these since 1982. My grandma had one of these. - Do not touch my stuff! - That's quick... kickboxer. [BURPS] Where you goin'? - Patrol. - Not without this you're not. Goes on like this. [MOUSE CLICKING] [CLANGS] [BEEPS] [RATTLING] [CLANGING] [MOUSE CLICKING] Um.. Do you miss me yet? - What are you doing? - Me? I'm not doing anything. Just a little, uh welcome ceremony, a little initiation.. To the security world. [BUTTONS CLICKING] - Open the door, Cooper. - Cooper, this is not a game. - Games? I don't play games. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [FOOTSTEPS] [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] [WHISPERING CONTINUES] - Cooper, let me out! Cooper, let me out of the elevator! Please, Cooper, let me out! Please, Cooper! Please open the door! Cooper! Open the door! - Relax. I'm just testing the cut-off switch. - Please open the door! Cooper! - Seems to be workin' fine. [GASPS] [WHIRRING] [PANTING] [EXHALES HEAVILY] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [FOOTSTEPS] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] - I can see-e-e you-u-u. - I can't believe how huge and beautiful it is. - That's what she said. - This place is amazing. - You wanna see something even better? - Why should I trust you all of a sudden? - 'Cause I'm all you got tonight, babe. Go over your left and exit through there. Then your right, go down that corridor. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [PANTING] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [THUNDER RUMBLING] - They really spared no expense. [THUNDER RUMBLING] And nobody will live here? - They never finished it. - It's so dark in here. Uh! What is that smell? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SCREAMS] Uh! - First night, you found an intruder. Very promising, Ms. Streak. - Jerk. - This way. - Hey, Cooper, did you hear that? - Hear what? [INTENSE MUSIC] - Never mind. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [BEEPING] Ah! [HUFFS] - Complimentary first night meal. Enjoy. - This looks like hospital food. - You know why hospital food tastes the way it does? - Why? - 'Cause it makes you wanna get out of the hospital. Think about that. - Uh, why are you being so nice to me? - I'm not being nice. - That's company policy. In a few hours, your stomach's gonna be grumbling and you're gonna wanna fall asleep. You need that fuel. - She's pretty. - Is that your daughter? - Yup. - Are you guys close? - Hey. Enough. - You know, I have a daughter, too. - Good. - Her name's Clara. [KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING] [KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING] [COMPUTER BEEPS] [KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING] [COMPUTER BEEPS] [KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING] [BEEPS] How come I can't get 441 on the screen? - Because there is no 441. - It says 441 right here. - They never got around to finishing it before they ran out of money. - Where's the circuit breaker for the cameras? - I said there's no 441. It doesn't matter what the blueprint says. If anyone should know, it's me. I've been here since the beginning of time. - Well, someone should check it out. - That's a good idea, someone should do that. So why don't you go down there? Matter of fact, I'm telling you to go down there and don't come back until we have 441 on the grid. What are you waiting for? [SNAPPING FINGERS] - Fine, I will. - Ah-ah. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] [SIGHS] [EERIE MUSIC] - 4-4-1-4-3-7-8-5-2. 4-4-1-4-3-7-8-5-2. 4-4-1.. 4-3-7... 8-5-2. Circuit breaker, where are you? 4-4-1-4-3-7-8-5-2. [STREAK SIGHS] 4-4-1.. [CLICKS] 4-3-7.. [CLICKS] 8-5-2. 8-5-2. 8-5-2. [CLICKS] [CLANGS] - You happy now? - Hello? Is someone there? Is somebody there? - You talkin' to the walls now? - That what you're doin'? What are you doing? [CLANKING] - Nothing. [POUNDING ON DOOR] [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] - Keeping busy? - I heard something in there. - Yeah, what's that? - I don't know, behind the door. - There's nothing there, I told you that. - You knew about this, didn't you? Why are there cameras down there and why were they turned off? - Because it's an unfinished section and they told us not to go down there. - There's something there. - Impossible. - There. Can you see it? [BUZZING] Oh, God! [PANTING] I told you something's not right. [DOORBELL BUZZING] - No, we have company. - What does he want? - Probably wants shelter for the night. [SIGHS] - What are we gonna do about it? - Well, one of us is gonna have to go down there and tell him to scram before he breaks that window. [NO AUDIO] And I guess that person will be me. - I didn't realize. - Save it. - I'm coming with you. - Oh, really? Now? [POUNDING ON DOOR] Sorry, buddy, you gotta turn around. - Please, man, it's so cold out there. - I have no place to go. - Can't do it. - Come on, you have all that space in there and it just stands empty. I just need one night inside! - You gotta move on. - I told you. The storm's gonna get worse. Find some place. - Please, I'm begging you, man! - I'm begging ya! I.. Honest, I mean no harm. I... I... I.. Honest to God. I just, just need one more night inside. I'll be gone before sunrise. No one will know. Please, man, I'm begging ya! I'm begging ya! - It's not my call. Sorry. Move. Streak, shut the door. Now! Shut it, Streak! - Come on! Come on. Hey, don't leave me here! Come on, have some compassion, man! Have a heart! I'm gonna die out here tonight. I'm gonna die out here while you're inside! And I hope you remember my face! And I hope you think of me before you go to bed at night! - What's he gonna do? - He's an old man. We can't leave him like this. Have a heart, Cooper. - I said no. [INTENSE MUSIC] - Please! - I'm letting him in. - No, you're not. - It's freezing out there. - I'm not losing my job for him. - You don't have to worry. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - Thank you. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] Nice doggie. It's good now. Yeah. I gotta.. Thank you. - You can stay here. - Oh, wow, yeah.. - But you have to leave before sunrise. - Okay. - And don't go walking about. The entire building's wired with cameras. We won't hesitate to throw you out. - What's your name? - Jim. - Look, Jim, I don't know you but I just put myself out on a limb for you and I need to know you're not gonna screw me over. - Cross my heart. - What's your name? - Julia. - I'm sorry about earlier today, Julia. I'm a good person, really. I'm not a bad person. - Prove it. - Okay. What's up, boy? What are you thinkin'? Huh? What are you thinkin'? [INTENSE MUSIC] [MUSIC ON PLAYER] [CLANGING] [METAL CLANGING] [COUNTRY MUSIC ON SPEAKERS] [CLANGS] [GRUNTING] [SIGHS] [CLANGS] [DOOR CREAKING] [WHOOSHING] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] But it's all in vain  [WHIRRING] What can I do..

Some manly duties. Where the hell are you right now? - I'm in a shelter downstairs! Have you seen this place? - It doesn't look like anything to me. - There's like all these drawings! It's like a dormitory or something! Did you know about this place? - I was told not to go in there, so were you. Get back up here. - There's something still living here, I know it. - Streak, did you shut the shelter door behind you? - No. Why? - Because somebody did. I told you not to let that piece of shit in here. - Oh, no, no! - Oh, no, no, no! [BREATHING HEAVILY] [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] - It's not him. - Oh, it's not? Really? Who locked the door, the wind? - Please just help me find the exit. [BREATHING HEAVILY] - Can you remember how you came in? - You can't tell me? - There are no cameras there. - I told you that, remember? I've no idea to know where you are. - It's too dark in here to see! - Hold still for a minute. And just relax. Can you see anything? [BREATHING HEAVILY] A light, an arch, a chair something familiar you remember on the way in. - Everything looks the same. - What was that? - What? Cooper, what? - Nothing. I... I thought that I saw something. - Stop messing with me. - I'm not messing with you. Must have been video interference here. It went black. - I'm in control of myself and I won't have my mind play tricks on me. I'm in control of myself and I won't have my mind play tricks on me. I'm in control of myself and I won't have my mind play tricks on me.. - Stop. Look. Go towards the back and to the left. I think if you go that... - You're wrong. I know where to go. - What do you mean? - I know where I am. [KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING] - Streak.. Streak, listen to me. I... I can't see you. If you can hear me, don't move stay right where you are. Do not move. I'm coming down. - This way. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SCREAMING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [GASPING] [PANTING] - What happened? [PANTING] You okay? You see? That homeless piece of shit that you let in locked you in. - It wasn't him. - Right. We're gonna find him right now. We're gonna escort his ass out. He's gonna sleep tonight in a puddle. - There's something else in there. It was not him. - Something? What? Hundred bucks says he left his room. Come on, let's go find out. - Jim? [THUNDER RUMBLING] - He's not here. And that's why you keep this scum outside, understand? - Where you going? - I'm gonna try to catch him, save our jobs. [CLICKS] - Come on, boy. Come on, boy. Come on. Take it easy, boy. Come on, boy. Come on up. Come on, boy. Come on, boy. [WHOOSHES] Come on. [CLICKING] [WHOOSHING] [CLICKING] [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] [BUZZING CONTINUES] Boy? Is that you? Oh.. Boy? What the hell? [CREAKING] What do you know? Yeah. Yeah! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] What the.. [SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] [SCREECHING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [RUSTLING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] - I can't breathe in this. [KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING] I'm locking this place up. - Well, I can't find this scumbag anywhere and that's unacceptable. Shit. - Found it. - Wellville, a center for physically deformed and mentally challenged children. Last week, I received a phone call from an anonymous source complaining about the treatment of the children hospitalized here. So I decided to show up unannounced. And what you're about to see.. Are some of the most disturbing images... this reporter has ever witnessed. We were told to go straight down to the basement where the institute holds some of its youngest patients many of them orphans. And what we found was horrifying. [SHUDDERING] [GROANING] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Kids, some as young as five years of age left unattended for hours in this grizzly basement. We found one child covered in his own feces sitting alone on the bathroom floor. [CHILD PANTING] - We don't need to watch this. - Wait. - The man at the helm of this institute, Dr. Thorndike points a finger at the county. - You have to understand nobody else wants these children. - Well, it doesn't seem that you want them either. - We're low on staff. - We're low on budget. - Then how do you respond to the allegations of malpractice? - It's preposterous. We have some of the best and most qualified physicians in the country. - Dr. Thorndike, is it true that some of your patients have been victims of abuse and neglect at this institute? - Alright, that's it. - We're done here. - So we leave today.. But the children stay behind unable to cry for help so we must cry for them. I'm Warren Rawlings. Back to you, Bob. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] - These poor kids. They probably spent their life in there. I could sense it, they're still there. - He's the one who locked you in. You got confused and scared. You're a very confused girl. - I'm telling you what I saw. - Enough already. Enough! I know your problem. - What are you talking about? [RATTLING] - You went through my stuff? - Yeah, I did. Because somehow something wasn't just quite right tonight. Something didn't smell right. Because in all my years here, one night shift with you has created more havoc than anything I've ever seen. Did you not take your three anti-psychotic pills this evening? - That's none of your business. - Oh, it is now. - Look, I'm not crazy. My whole life I've been able to sense things that I can't describe. And when I told the doctor about it he put me on these pills. And if I don't take these pills then they're gonna take Clara away. - Your daughter Clara? You can't do this. This job is not for you. This is not right for you. This building at night... - I'm not crazy. - I am not crazy, Cooper. I know what I saw. Please, I am not crazy! Look. We gotta call him out of there and then we've gotta shut the door. We can't let those kids out. We've gotta shut the door, Cooper. Cooper, please, I'm begging you. Please, we gotta shut the door. - Because spirits can't travel through doors? - Is that why? - You don't understand. I have seen some things down there, Cooper. - I have seen things down there. - You're gonna sit down. - You're not going anywhere. - Why not? - Because you're delusional, that's why. You've done enough tonight. - Cooper, I... - I'm not letting you out of here. - Why? - Because you're not thinking right. Because you put me in jeopardy. Because I need this job. I don't have anywhere else to go! You can take your pill and go fool someone else like you fooled me! I can't. No pill... changes this. Do you understand? - I'm so sorry. - Don't be. I don't need your pity. Are you fucking kidding me? - They won't leave us alone unless we shut the door, Cooper. - Or what, you're gonna stun me? - I'm gonna do it. - Put it down. You're not gonna do it. No, you're not, because it's just gonna prove that you're crazy and you're gonna lose everything. - Please, Cooper, I'm begging you. Please. - I'll go down. I'll go down and I'll shut the door. Okay? Okay? Okay? See? That's better. - What are you doing? Cooper? Cooper, no! Don't leave me like this, please! - I'm not taking any chances. Can't trust you anymore. - Please hurry, Cooper! Please I.. Don't leave me alone! Cooper. - What? - Don't take the elevator. - Seriously? [INTENSE MUSIC] [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [ELEVATOR WHIRRING] Oh, come on. Streak, did you touch anything up there? - I'm not doing anything. [CLANGS] [ELEVATOR THUDS] [SIGHS] - Goddamn generator. - It's not the generator. - Maybe we should call someone. - That's a good idea. That way we can both be fired and thrown out in the storm with the homeless piece of shit that you let in here. Maybe you can tell 'em your ghost stories that'll amuse 'em. I'm gonna try to pry this thing open and get to the breaker. [GRUNTING] - Don't do it. It's not safe. [GRUNTING] [INTENSE MUSIC] [WHIRRING] Cooper, it's closing. Watch out! [WHIRRING] - Uh! - Cooper! [WHIRRING CONTINUES] [CLANGS] [INTENSE MUSIC] [PANTING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [HUFFS] Cooper, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm alright. You know, there's only one thing I wanna know that I don't understand. - What's that? When you were down in that shelter how did you know where the entrance was? How did you know which way to go? - I don't know. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] - Did you hear that? - Hear what? Oh, my God. Cooper, you gotta get out of there. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] - Well, can you see something? [INTENSE MUSIC] What did you see? - The kids. They're out. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] Cooper, can you hear me? - There's no such thing as ghosts. Or your mumbo-jumbo getting in my head. Just had a few drinks. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] Wait. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] Yeah. Well, let's get this over with. - In here. [DOG PANTING] - I can hear the dog. Hey, boy. [WHISTLING] Come on out now. Come on, boy. Come here now. Goddammit. [WHISTLES] I'm not going in there. Hey! If you're in there.. It's your last chance. I'm shutting this door. [WHEELCHAIR RATTLES] [WHEELCHAIR RATTLING] [GRUNTS] - Close the door! - What's going on? What's going on? [WHEELCHAIR RATTLING] What's going on? Ow! - What are you doing? - Don't go in there! [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] - I can't control it. - Cooper, no! - I can't stop! - No! Cooper, can you hear me? [PANTING] No, no, no. Oh.. Please.
