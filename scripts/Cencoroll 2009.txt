You really don't feel like it, do you? Come on, let's go after him. He is a bit big, though... Here you go. Yuki! Good morning. 'Morning. Did you see the news? Yeah. Another giant monster. They're saying that area's going to be closed off for a while. Wanna go see? Just for a bit. No way. It's not like you can get close, anyway. I guess so... You really like that stuff, don't you? Man, this is heavy. Hey! What are you doing? This is my bike, you know. Sorry. You weren't planning on stealing it, were you? Of course I wasn't! I wonder... Wait! I really wasn't. It just seemed like your bike moved or something... Hey, let go. Ow! Cenco! Giant monster... Kei! Oh, you're back. What? Sorry, I'm leaving early! Hey! Amamiya Tetsu... and Cenco. What a strange name. You... Don't go telling anyone. It's a secret, right? So this thing can transform? Is it an alien? Secret. Is it friends with the big one from the news? Hey, are you listening? Don't feed him weird stuff. Sorry. Whoa. See ya. And don't tell anyone. Can you ride in him? I want you to give me a ride! I won't tell anyone, really. Sorry it took so long. I bought these. What? Pudding. Seriously? I bought them because I skipped out on cleaning duty. They're for a friend. And one for you, too. Oh, hold this for a sec. I'll go get you a spoon. I don't need one. You want one? Geez. This is all because she gave you weird food. Yo. What? I wonder if he saw us... You've got a pretty cool car. It's one of them, isn't it? Hide yours. Can I have that car? Who are you? I already picked my prey, so let's do this later. Already picked your prey? The big one? Want me to call him? He stands out, doesn't he? I figured someone like you would go after him, so I left him out there. What? It's a bit too far, huh... Helloooo... You have two of them? What are you doing? Go hide somewhere. What? Somewhere...? Anywhere is fine. Hey! Who is he? Shut up! I said to get back! You're going to get hurt. Here, hold this. Cenco! What...? Let's shoot him. Hey. Idiot, look out! Shit. Cenco... She's in the way. What? Wait! So it can transform, huh? That's a nice one. Are you okay? Yeah, just a bit tired. What was that all about? Do you know him? It doesn't have anything to do with you. What's your problem? What are you going to do about the pudding? Like I care. You put me in danger, too. What? I'm going home. I'll take you home, if you want. I'm fine. Thanks for letting me ride in him. Thanks for saving me earlier. See ya. What were you thinking, giving her a ride like that? I probably should've gotten a ride after all... I guess I'll have to run... Hey there. Don't run away. Do you need something? Where is he? I don't know! Tell him I want to meet again. What? Why me? Got it? Yes, I got it. You're just a normal person, aren't you? What's your relationship with him? Nothing really. We only met today. I wonder what we should do about the place. Well, whatever. Tell him to come to the top of that building tomorrow. Got it? Yeah. What's your name? Yuki. That's why I said I'd drive you. What were you two doing? Come on, or I'll spread it all over the school. Shut up. Leave me alone. It's not like you have to keep it a secret. I'll listen if you want to talk about it. You're annoying. What? How am I annoying? Geez. Aren't you scared? I said to stop that! It's chocolate. Don't feed him weird stuff. It'll affect his transformations. You're so weird. You're the weird one. Okay then, what does he normally eat? Come on. There was a monster, right? Yeah. He eats those sorts of things. He eats them? If he doesn't eat, he'll die, obviously. Can he learn to listen to what I say, too? No way. You have to have one of these. Hey, truants! Kei... What, am I interrupting something? Not at all. Well, I've passed the message on. I think you're better off not going, though. Let's go. What's up with that panda? No idea. He's got some guts. I wonder if she caught a cold or something. You sure got quiet. Why did you bring me here? As a hostage. Sure is noisy. They're trying to hold the perimeter around the big guy. I hope you lose, you jerk. Well then, shall we mix in with the helicopters? Do you have the transformation down? Hey, are you listening? You've been acting weird lately. What's wrong? What are you doing?! You idiot! Stay down there for a bit. I'm going to keep an eye out for your white friend. I wouldn't move around much if I were you. You're kidding, right? You jerk! Is he here? What are you doing? Don't miss. How did you climb up here? Help me! I was brought here by force. What? By who? Who? Seriously? Hey, Cenco. Are you okay? Hey, it's your turn! Let's get this over with and get out of here! Hey, where's Amamiya? I'm going to go get somebody... Cenco... Hey! You're okay? It looks bad out there. Let me rest for just a bit. Hey, what happened to your arm?! Cenco ate it. Ate it?! Ow... Shit... Cenco, change control to me! Idiot, what are you going to do? Well, you're about to pass out! I'll control him. I won't give him to anyone. If you don't hurry up, we'll be eaten! Cenco, you! Shit... Are you okay? Alright, assimilation complete. Wow, he actually did it. He's a bit big, though... What? He's being pulled...? Cenco? What? Hey! It's you, right? Yeah. Let me in, too. What's going on now? Hurry! Okay, I will. My control was taken... There was still someone in there? Come on, we're going! Where are you heading? Hey! What? Can't you make him any smaller? He stands out too much. Shut up for a bit. Walk carefully. This is bad! Hey! Watch out! Hurry up and bring me inside! Yo. It was you, huh? Give me back control of this thing. Get out! Stay like that. Don't act up. What? Where exactly did she put me...? Cenco... This is horrible. Don't die. Dammit, my head hurts from getting shot up like that... It seems like the assimilation couldn't complete because of the shock. Anyway, let's move for now. Hey, what's wrong?! The transformation won't terminate? What do you mean you can't turn back?! I brought him. You'd better behave. Sorry. So I've lost one... I'll have to go and get another. But before that... He's okay... right...? Cenco, let's get out of here. Get a grip! It got smashed... It sure did. Hey, show me your arm. Go ahead and wear it. He remembers your arm well. Hey. Just stay still. How would we explain this? It'll be a pain if we're found, so let's get out of here. You traitor. Come on. You can walk, right? Let's hurry.
