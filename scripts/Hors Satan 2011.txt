We will do everything we can to clear up this affair. Could you tell me in what circumstances you found your husband? No. I don't know. She doesn't know, she doesn't know. Then we must... We will check inside. Try to figure out the circumstances. Forgive me. For all the harm he did to you. Come quickly. Come quickly. My daughter is not well. It is a few days that she is in this state. The doctor won't tell me anything. What are you doing here? I have already told you that this place is off-limits. You, I don't want to see you here again. Take your gear and clear out. Are you finished? - Give me a kiss. - No. - Give me a kiss. - No. - Come on, kiss me. - No. - Come on... - No. - No. - Come on... No. - You could have come with me. - No. Ok... I'll go. - I have to go see my mother. - OK. I'll stay here. How are you? Ok. I am preparing my fire, now. Well. I'll go. We sit here? Yeah. - Do you mind if I wear only a bra? - No. He... Yeah, Ok, I'll go. Hey, what are you doing? It is hard at home at the moment. I've had enough. My mother won't stop crying. She's always after me. She's complaining. She doesn't realise what I've gone through. Stop it, you're totally insane! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! - What do you want ? - Come. I shot without looking. You shot without looking... How could you do something like that? I'll go. We'll see each other tomorrow, it's better this way. - Hi. - How are you? Thank you. - Did you sleep well? - Ok. You wouldn't have a fag would you? Thanks. It's nice today. Yes. We go for a walk? We are waiting for the ballistics results. And those of the autopsy. We have no leads yet to advance the investigation. We can't tell you anything more. For now, it's on stand-by. Ok. We are doing everything to clear up this affair. - Well. Ok? - Ok. There. The investigation is in progress. They know how to do it, though. Anyway, we did what we had to do. So you don't worry with your step-dad. He won't hurt you anymore. You saved me. What do we do? I don't know. Is there something wrong? I'll be fine. Don't worry. It's because you're not in the habit. You can come in. My mother has gone to Boulogne. - You want some? - No, no. Are you on the moon? I'll clear out. I'll pass by to see you in a while. Ok, see you. He, oh! He, oh! Hello. Hello... You smell good. What are you doing? I was strolling. I'm going back now. I've just seen your friend. You want to go out with me? I already told you that I don't. There is no point, I don't have any feelings. Give me a kiss. Whatever you say, you smell like love. Where were you? I was looking everywhere for you. I was out strolling. Didn't you get caught by the storm? No, I took cover. I ran into the guard, when I was looking for you. This time... he chatted me up. Worse than the other times. This time, he kissed me. Are you an idiot or what? Oh, oh... Ok, Ok... You scared me! - What were you doing? - Nothing. He scares me. He's on the side of the lane, over there. - On the side ? - Yes. Hugo, here! Hugo, come here, doggy! Come here. Fuck off, get lost! Get lost! Get the fuck off! Come here! Come. Come! Come on. Why don't you want me? That's how it is. Don't you want me at all? It's strange. You think he's dead? You could just take me. Come on, that's enough! Come on, give me a break. Wait for me. Thank you, thank you, thank you... Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, thank you! Go back inside. Thank you. - Are you Ok? - Yes. I must go. I can't watch this. Look, it is spreading. I don't understand what happened. - I don't know. - Who could have done that? I couldn't say. It's sad, nonetheless. You have but to cross, you will see, there will be no more fire. Are you kidding me? You do it yourself. You are really an ass. Why are you doing this to me? I will fall. Go on, you are halfway there. I will fall. No, look. There is already less smoke. I can't look back. Is it true? I swear it's true. Come. Do you want me to come get you? You're an ass. Fuck! You lunatic! - Look, look. - You are getting on my nerves. Look, look. There is no more smoke. Come on. - Where are you taking him? - That's it, move along. - Hello. - Hello. He! Hello. Do you know the road to Boulogne-sur-Mer? Are you going back, now? I saw you in the marshes, you know. It's a nice place. You know if I can crash there? No, it's full of mosquitoes. I am not afraid of mosquitoes. A little beer? That would be nice. Cheers. You know you're a sweetheart? If you want, you can fuck me. Do you want? Wait. Come. Take this! - How long did you stay there? - An hour. The guard filled a complaint against me. Did you get into a fight? No, I passed by the fields. Well... I have to go prepare something to eat. What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? They caught the murderer. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom...
