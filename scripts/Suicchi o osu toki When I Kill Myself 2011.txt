To the kids who underwent surgery A "switch" was given. Yaaa! Help, help... With the collected data, the state of mind of the children are investigated. Living test subjects count 6 When I press the switch Why so suddenly... We dont know what to do. Also to get the children to suicide is not that simple. Wasn't this project begun because they do easily suicide. Even I am giving my best. You're streching our kindess year for year, what exactly do you do there Anyways... i will have it now according to our plan. Father, mother, itadakimasu (thanks for the meal). Wait,where is your "itadakimasu"? Itadakimassu Im sorry.. Today my mother isn't well... Probably.... getting made a tasty.. Show it! And then... I got it made especially... Don't speak to yourself! You're noisy, shut up and eat! Great eh. They would be proud eh. How this is for mental state... Is that mama eh? Mama: its lonely eh, kisses. What's this !? You have been writing such stuff. This is... yours? These are for finding the suicide reason.. THATS the approved reason! I'm very sorry. If you're understanding that... hurry up and die! And properly... Draw a cow. Do it properly! Ah, he needed until yesterday Hei Ryota! Look, its empty. Hello! Is the secretaries room... over there? Thank you. And still 6... Sendai aah youre from niigata, Minami ? You were sent to a lot of places. Just do nothing. If something happens i have to shoulder it. Eating times are 7, 12 and 18 o'clock.bring em back at 20. study time is automatic per bell. also... Did they really live here for 7 years? Only they are tough... at the beginning it were 40. Everyone pressed the switch in the first year. Well its good money so i stay, but its an unpleasant job. Almost no time, youre together with them for 24 hours. Also almost no long holidays.. Here is No. 67. Thank you for before, whats your name? Number 67. Name... I'm Minami Youhei, nice to meet ya! Hei, everything gets recorded. Whats so urgent? Whats your name ? No.3 . Take care cause he is the brutal one. Nice to meet you. Good evening. Is this... your father and mother ? You better stop.. They poke you from behind. Even though their body has grown, in mind they are still grade schoolers. You're good at drawing eh. Who likes Mangas ? What about those ? Pencils... Ehm also... this here If youre not playing... should i play !? I mixed some flour sweat into the stew, if there people who hate it? Its tasty! Probably also there is poison in it! Why should there be. Itadakimasu. Naota, hand it over, GIVE IT TO ME! Need seconds ? Bring your plates, there is more for everyone. Whats up Takamiya san I'm No. 67. Takamiya Masami san. I'm Number 67. Dont be afraid.. its ok. Because.. I don't approve such an experiment. Children of 10 years who aren't to blame and can't run To insert a device that destroys the heart. And let them suicide. And to discover the reason... Is this what a country should do... Youre not here because you want to, isn't it so !? Minami san... Did read that very good. Whats this.. Hurry up and clean! I will get us liquor... They will get angry at us from such stuff. It's ok! Noo it's not! From today on you will do the outer lookout. We had no outside guard so its perfect timing... Its an important job... good luck. A new person came. Cheerful person. nice person... suspicious Father. mother. See you tomorrow. Good night. I found them! The letters to you. From your mother and father. To Aiko One week has passed .. since you were taken. Mom and Dad think everyday only of you. I hope youre healthy. Mom and Dad belive so and go everyday to the public office begging so you can come home soon. They clean, and keep your room intact. It feels as if youre studying. Ai chan Ai chan, i want to meet you! I want to embrace you! Let me hear what they send. To Aiko. Today is Ai chan's 16th bithday. Also this year do Mom and Dad celebrate Al chan's birthday. Also I wanted Ai chan. And i begged Dad multiple times for a small dog. And finally a very cute female dog came into our house. And also ... A child was born. A very cute girl. Her name is Manami She has the same sign like Ai chan. Ai chan. I call her Ai chan She is cute. Mom and Dad haven't forgotten you. Its not like they wanted a replacement, they probably wait forever for your return. I wanted you to understand. Its probably hard for your Mom and Dad. Good night. Am I not needed anymore? DON'T ABANDON ME! Can't you sleep? Dont die! FATHER, MOTHER! I will protect you all. Good night. See you tomorrow. Here we say "see you tomorrow". See you tomorrow. Its 5 years ago since we saw this car. Whats with Minami san... Who knows.. Suicide data of a 17 year old isn't that valuable. Isn't that even a first time in japan. When i do it... You seem to missunderstood something! Excuse me, I will call back. Let me go! Behave! You again!? If you wanna go out, PRESS THE SWITCH! Please stop, stop. I will report this! Are you alright? Where is medical room? Are you alright? I never begged you to help me. See you tomorrow. She is... In a center... Probably before i was taken here, She was taken away.. At Haruka's birthday, They suddenly came. You will be taking part in the teenagers suicide experiment as a test subject. I will rescude her.. I promised that no matter what I will come to help her. Who would have though that also us would be in this situation. Thats why ... the letters.. The director told me... That the center she is in was shut down. As if i would be frightened by that, Haruka is waiting for me. I will go now there and give it to her. Come tomorrow at 3 to the place with the stairs. As i expected she is still alive eh. I told you there is now way she would press the switch. Wheres her answer ? It's my fault, all my fault... Why, did you do something to Haruka? I gave her the letter... And ? Haruka read it and.... This is... No, no this isn't Haruka's. No, no its not!? Isn't it wrong!? Say something! Haruka Yada: passed away Lie! Lie, its a lie! Why, why Haruka! You were, Haruka's hope. People don't die while being in despair... When they lose their hope, they give up on something. How did you get that! Exactly who are you? What's going on... So suddenly. Masami? Did you know that these experiments are ending. Will we also be shutdown? I will be able to return to Tokyo! Coming! I will completly support you! I happened to be on a business trip nearby.. It's alright... We wont press it no matter what. Wont we? Who's hope was this? From the children who died 6 years ago... The results of this experiment are superb. Well we're already been doing it for 10 years.. Teenage suicides have decreased.. The politicians are also happy. We found a pattern in the suicide of the children. Its already a requirement for teachers to know that data. Everything thanks to the sacrifices of the children For you... For you at least... i want you to become happy Its finishes fast... Because there are only 4 plates. How is it outside? For example whats famous on TV ? I don't watch TV... Ah i guess i will help you with the cooking... It will become tasty if you add some spices. And also ... this. Don't tell the director. Ah, she can laugh! So, let's do it! What are you two doing? Food! Whats that? Seasoning! This will become tasty. If we have some ingredients, I can make you something. Look at this! Hiro wrote Haruka letters... You know that. Yes. Hiro gave you this, isn't that so. Then why did you threw it away! I took it with me. That Haruka is in a center isn't she? Then isn't she dead already? And also the day Aiko pressed the switch, you also were in her room. What did you do? What did you tell Aiko! Nothing in particular... From the start you came here to kill us! Why should i! We did survive 7 years together! And suddenly 2 died! Isn't that abnormal! You made Hiro and Aiko press the switch! You're wrong! Who is next? Nozomi? Isn't that your style to pick one after another? Do you believe that story? I said it should be shredded But this girl.... Now, lets press the switch! Why are you living? You are here for a suicide experiment! You have worth because you die! Isn't it so? Where is that switch? Dont' come! stop! Thats dangerous! Murder is a crime! suicide is fine though. Whats this... Why? A switch! Whats this S? Sendai... then .... 10 is ? The prolonging of the anti suicide project was dropped. we have to end the experiment till next year. I made a pledge to let all remaining participants go. But, it was turned down. They said "we can't let them out alive" But at least, i want to save you! One of us.... Don't compare me to you! Anyway isn't it your lie out in the open. But youre different! You have no hope, thats why you don't despair! You won't ever press that! You can do it! Because you are the person who has seen many suicide! I'm different. What's that? Return it! I made 10 YEARS! Most died in the first year. I made it all this time alone! Even 10 years... Teenage sucicide have increased? as if I care, just go off and die! I want to live! But still... just cause of that.... why.. Why am I force to think about death! Just die! Stop it! I want to live! I want to LIVE! TO LIVE! LIVE, TO LIVE! TO LIVE! TO LIVE!! To live... To live Live... Stop. Stop it! STOP IT! STOOOP IT! We also want to live! Just cause of this reason.. See you tomorrow... Lets all meet here... Kimiyaki Hei, what are you doing! If i kill some people, I can go out!

ANYHOW I WILL GET OUT HERE Return it. Im still... Return it Please... Hasami. Ryouta... Ryouta... We told us "if we exchange it we won't press it" Right after we came here. To exchanged the switches.... Must report this. (TODO) I heard about you. Now that they now, there is nothing more you can do isn't there? What are you doing about that? I hear it all from the director... Did he tell you to observe me? In the case of death due to the refusing of food, will be noted as suicide. I have always lived in a beautiful world.. But.. I was dirty. Chiyo, it's not your fault. You did save me! Didn't you. I ... Did the same thing as you. Please press that. Please! Let's run! But... Saroto Wait! There are on the second floor Wait!
