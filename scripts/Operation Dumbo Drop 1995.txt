I do not? What about you? We are risking all our lives so you have a clean conscience does. You're afraid that if you are on the roof sitting and looking back on your career... ...that's not like what you see. That erases everything Vietnam. You want a good deed do before you leave.

I always sang so bad. Have faith, mumbo jumbo. You knew he was coming. I was first in Hau Bon. Every Wednesday were Mr. Goddard and Marie Antoinette along. He gave us good information the Vietcong. I just love America. You also gave the Vietcong good information about us. I can not help. I love everyone. Wine anyone? Wine? We are sometimes in a gallery? We liberate the oppressed. Not drinking and partying. Now. What have I done? I need top-commands on path... ...not Dumbo, Mr. French and the Three Stooges. D'ng lai, which means 'stop'. Dee, that means 'go'. Try it. Well done. You know two key words al And what is the third? It means "get off me". Do you remember that sleep on? - That was you really like, huh? Linh was right, you're weird. I can get as much as you want. - Tonight we passed Pon Hau. We'll show a path that does not hands of the enemy. And so to Pleiku. Friday, we fly to Bo Tat Roof NHE. In the afternoon she is there. Easy. Decks. Cover all costs. Do not shoot they are out of reach. They hit us so. I know, I'm in the artillery. You have to zigzag. Keep moving. What did Bo Tat? - She's hurt here. She was seasick. She will puke. My child asks later, "What was it worst? I know it well. Can you faster? Soon my boat goes to the basement. - Maybe not. Gilman, who had me head you can deliver? That was just "kidding. I love you as a brother. Are you crazy? Where can I find a Triumph Spitfire? Dirty rat. Sorry, my apologies. Well, agreed. Put him with artillery. A direct line. Go ahead. Dirty... Here. Stay tuned. We are on the Song Ba, the NVA is with a boat behind us. Yes, Hotel Alpha. Who is I? Barney? Hey, how are you? We need your help, pronto. We need artillery. Bravo fire in ordinates Romeo 35,411,059. Once to highlight it. That was perfect, Barney. - No, he almost hit us. We move, the coordinates are perfect as she... Fire directed. Now. The boat off. You now called the Brown BOMBERS. You want him to try? I have a place to sleep. What is this place? - An ancient temple. 'S Buddhist Temple? - A Tam Giao Temple. What Buddhism, which Confucianism and what Tao. And those elephants? The elephant god Tam Giao. No god, father god. In the beginning were white elephants. They flew into the air with the clouds. It went 'n elephant down and crept into Queen Maya... ...while they slept. She had a baby, Prince Siddhartha, Gautama the Buddha. Elephant god father. Linh, that was a great story. Flying elephants, which was very good. But you might as well start with: "In the beginning, black elephant. " The only possibility is this path after the Pleiku. Is that only safe? - I do not know. We can ask, or create Americans-with-elephant suspicion? We can send Linh. Nobody suspects him. You can not. You know why. We can not take that risk. I will go. I do not care who your family murdered. You probably also not. Vietcong killed the mother and sister. Linh know who killed father. Linh and father went home. There was a big light. Everything happened quickly, people call. Shooting. Father loves Linh down. Bo Tat runs. They shoot Bo Tat down. Father Linh and countries apart. Father runs to Linh, falls down. He shot. Linh moving. Bo Linh Tat rescues. Men shoot at Bo Tat many times. Bo Tat goes very far. Bo Tat save me. Were you injured? You said you could not move. - That was because I was too scared. Therefore father died, I too scared. - Why is he not died. Of course you were scared. I would have. Everyone. Linh, it was not your fault. - From whom? People. People far away. People who never have been. - Linh does not understand. How did you get in Ban Don? - With American note. He said he take me to the mountains brings back. He lied. I'll take you back to the hills. I promise. Linh father was a good father, a prime best father. I like to think that. I like to think that. Is it safe path to Pleiku? Yes, the path is safe. There is no Vietcong. I had to pee. I wanted to desecrate the temple. - Never mind. He sat down to eat out. They learn quickly that we are here. I will visit him out. - The elephant needs to Pleiku. How do we walk Bo? - Linh Farley has learned. Of course not. Well, he has it taught me. Take someone with you. - I've messed up, I go. That's crazy. My legs do not want anymore. Then I'll go. He has my watch. Where are your American friends? - I have not. Leave her a leg drop. We go. I do not know that command. Help me. - Grab the gun here. Your foot on my leg. Help your mind? In three. One, two, three. Push. I sit on it. - Well done. I do not know. She says she's ready. - No, angry. This way. We go around. This side. - I can not run. Stop her. - Good, good. Dee. I mean dee d'ng. Tell my ma I love her. Stop, you idiot beast. Farley, good mahout. Everything good? They got him pretty good had. - He has beaten me so often. When I told you in Hau Bon were, he believed. That we were Hau Bon? Why are you here go? - You wanted to know if path was safe. Linh can only ask. For Linh arrested, he told safe path. Linh Do you trust now? I trust Linh. Hug a lot. Deleted? How can the mission be deleted? - We have the village do not need. When you were on safari, the Ho Chi Minh trail moved. The village has no strategic importance. - No strategic interest? Major Pederson, sir. We're almost there. Please let us finish. We fly the elephant... - Where? The runway in the village? Recently destroyed by NVA. You can no countries the elephant. End of mission. Bo Linh Tat, and And then? The boy and the elephant, sir. - Bring them back. Where you going? - I Can not say. Then you will like me. Do you love me in return, be it war. The mission has been deleted. This is the captain ignored. Will you steal a truck? - If necessary. Why not steal once an airplane? Do you worry about the land? We do not have to land. Remember when I said: Give them show a tractor. How did we 'S tractor yet? Tractors do not have to land. Well, we need parachutes... - We? Yes, Captain. We. HA, Farley, do you take? If you're the elephant to NHE Roof , it is your career be over. Maybe we all have a good thing for us to leave. Which way did they go? - Over the mountains to Pleiku. Insane. Bo Tat is not a tractor. Now we hear't really feel by talking? I feel sorry for her. Tell anyone I said that. Secret, even without permission from the tower. No radio, no one knows what. This was not done. They've stolen 123. Five minutes ago. Damn, tell them to return. It sits there full of NVA artillery. An enemy unit comes Pleiku. Immediate destruction. Do not worry. - I've never jumped. They do not. Does she push? The parachutes and Bo Tat the crate open automatically. This line immediately gets the parachutes open. Three of you jumping for Bo Tat. Ten and counting freefall then withdraw. Understood? If you get confused in Bo Tat's wires. And go to their lands. Cahill and I remain on board until Bo Tat away. Then we go. Any Questions? - Will also Linh? No, you stay on board. Linh can take mine and I remain on board. Lin Bo Tat goes with it. - That's too dangerous. Linh you promise and Bo Tat home. Yes, you see Bo Tat about a couple of days. But you must first back. - You lie, you lie. You're right. I said I would bring you home and I do. I keep on board. I'll take you back to the mountains and Bo Tat. You can now not just with her. One more. Go under the radar. - This is not a fighter. You can not jump at this height. - Near the village, we fly higher. No, now go fly higher. We all leap. - But just above the village. We go now. - Get ready. Change of plan. - We are approaching the village. Staandebij. Ready? Forward. I can not, I forgot something. I'm an office clerk, I work in my office. Great, huh? Here goes. Is this fun, Poole? Hold on. Hold on. Pak'm. Hang, Bo Tat. I suppose the goal in sight. Target in sight. I await your command. Quang Comrade? Let him go. I do not want to shoot elephants, certainly not flying elephants. God, save me and I will never lie. Farley, you're dead. I swear, I'll murder you. Linh loves embrace. Careful. Everybody back. Is she okay? - All best prime order. Where is HA? - Give me a ladder. Backwards, Linh. - Get ready for the ceremony. Drop your weapons. You spend far elephant. Admirable, congratulations. Pity you the trouble to have done nothing. Vogel, thunder momentarily. Elephant will die. Drop your weapons. Understood, Whiskey Tango. About. Crossbow 6 close. What did he say? The good news is that you are a hero because you've caught Nguyen. And it bad? Photo Explorers report that the path weather is here. You should continue. That's bad news. I must go now, Linh. - Do you not like it here? I find it enjoyable. Better than I ever have been. You may not Linh. You know that's not true. - Why do you go? Like you had to go back to where you heard... ...I must return to where I belong. Forget your Linh? If I forget to breathe. Hang, Linh. Good journey home. - Good luck. I also hope to have command. - Well done, soldier. If you need something... If you and your brother on a roof... ...Enjoy your down what you see. Will you take Bo Tat? I will him fit. Have fun.
