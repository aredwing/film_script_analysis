You get it? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I get it now. It's gonna be a real scorcher in Yuma. Looking at a high of about 110. Okay, let's go back to the line. We have Lonnie from El Centro. Hey, Lonnie, what can I do you for? Hey there, you know I got them illegals all over my property. Ooh! Damn, that's smooth! What the hell you drinkin' that nasty shit for? 'Cause it's cheap. Makes it himself in his own damn shed. And it's like a gazillion proof. And it tastes like pb and j sandwich, see? It stinks like shit. Well, maybe you should take a hit off it, Connie. It'd loosen you up. How much looser y'all want me? Huh? Is that loose? Knock it off, Keith! Besides, I don't think Buck feels much like sharin'. Ain't that right? That depends. Depends on what? What Sharon looks like. Oh... Could you pull over? I need to use the little ladies room. Why? You gotta drop off the browns at the super bowl? Ow. Somethin' wrong with you. Buck? What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss? I said... What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss? Friendo. Que? Pedro, you ruinin' my shit. Just forget it. Ring this shit up. "Sabe"? You understand that? Hmm, Guacamole? S. Don't you ever go to the movies? Eleven dollar and 50 cents... Seor. Por favor. Sure got that money lingo figured out, don't ya? S, seor. God damn rabbits. Oh, get that out of my face! I'm sorry. God, you are startin' to reek of that shit! It's comin' through your pores! Home, home on the range  Where deer and the antelope play  You ready to have fun? Anything to get me out of this shit can. Well, this is it. This is where it all goes to shit... Every single night when the sun goes down. Damn straight. You know, we gonna make a difference. So now what, we're just gonna hang out here until nightfall and then scare the livin' shit out of 'em as they come over? Somethin' like that. You ready to have some fun? Oh, my god! Whoo! Whoo! Damn, that smells! Who in the hell are they, Buck?! They've been back here this whole time?! Get 'em the fuck out my truck. Oh, my god. What the fuck, Keith? Shh. Come on, grandpa. Let's go. Oh, you smell! Who are they? Damn, Buck, this one's a real El Porko! Must've eaten him some gorditas before we snagged him. Now, you are gonna let them go, right, Buck? Please tell me you're gonna let them go. Yeah... to hell. Get that gag out his mouth. All right. Come on. Why are their hands tied up? Por favor. Speak American, huh? Agua, por favor. Shut up! Shut up! Keith-- You shut the fuck up! Shh. Quiet. You know why we brung you back here, don't ya? 'Cause this is the place where all you beaners come over. You see? You see your clothes? You smell your filthy garbage? You're shitin' up my country. Please... I own a landscaping business. I'm a citizen. My kids are honor students. I pay taxes. Shut the fuck up! Stop it! Stop! Keith, make him stop! Shit! Get out of the way! Get your hands off me, Buck! This is crazy talk! Get your hands off me! Get off me! Whoo! Whoo! Oh, my god! See, we clean the human garbage up off the street. We bring you turds back here where you come from. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Come on, get up, old man. Get up, old man. Get up, old man! This is the end, Jose Cuervo. Please, please don't do this. Maybe the next time a group of you system suckers comes through here, They'll see the grave... And they'll know it ain't but a matter of time before me or somebody like me catches 'em, brings 'em right back here. Word'll spread. They'll think twice about comin' over my border. Fuckin' beaners. Fuckin' beaners can leave this country. Or you can leave this earth. I'm so sorry. Oh, god. Let's hurry up, get a position before the sun goes down. It's gonna be real busy around here. Weird how they keep buryin' the others. Yeah, well, if we keep roundin' 'em up and bringin' 'em back here, Maybe these dumbasses will get the picture. Where the hell Connie go? I don't know. Wonder if this one's got any gold in his teeth. Smile. Whoo hoo! Burial at sea! Whoo! Yeah. What the hell you doin', Connie? You never said nothin' to me about no killin'. You said we were just gonna scare 'em. Buck, give me the fuckin' truck keys! Connie! Put that gun down before you blow one of your tits off! Buck, give me the fuckin' keys! Oh, my god! What is that?! Don't just stand there! Get it off! Get it off me! Get it off me! Oh, my god! I can't see! Oh, god! Get off me, you bitch! Get off me, you bitch! Buck! What the hell you make of that? Looks like another god damn zombie. So should we go get her? What time is it? Nah, shift's over. Let's leave her for the damn animals. What the fuck you lookin' at? Don't. Oh. Can I help you? No, I-I don't think so. Hey! Mind your own business, motherfucker. Hey, come on. This is it. I don't know how to repay you. You don't have to repay me, min-ah. Just go to the police. I-I could take you. No, I can't. This guy could come back. They will send me back to Pyongyang, Taejung. Oh. I-I didn't know. I just figured you were-- No. I'm not. Although it seems like I have been here an eternity. Okay. Well, be careful. I'll see you around. Please come here, Taejung. I am having a small party, And I want to repay you for everything you have done for me. I don't know. I'm not much of a-- Just come, Taejung. You won't forget it. Promise. You came, Taejung Shi. At the end of the rainbow  There's happiness  But my life is a race  Just a wild goose chase  And my dreams have all been denied  Why have I always been a failure?  What can the reason be?  I wonder if the world's to blame  I wonder if it could be me  Hands on the wheel, please. Let's see your license and registration, please. Yeah, certainly. Thank you. You were, uh, swerving a little bit back there. Are you having some problems driving this evening? Oh, no, no, I was just closing the glove compartment, and I thought I saw something in the road. No big deal. And have you had anything to drink tonight? No, no, not at all. What was that? Why don't you pop the trunk for me, sir. You know, officer, I don't think it's any big deal. Just pop the trunk, please. I wonder if the world's to blame  I wonder if it could be me  Hands on the wheel, please. Let's see your license and registration, please. Yeah, certainly. Thank you.

Just pop the trunk, please. You're good to go. Just try to keep your eyes on the road, all right, sir? Thank you. Some fellows look and find the sunshine  I always look and find the rain  My little brother... Nothin' I wouldn't do for him... Or sacrifice I wouldn't make. Hey, em, will you get my back? Yeah, give me a second. Goal! Go in there and get it, man. Can't let you base too long, okay, babe? Need to get little man back home before mom calls missing persons. Here you go. Lower. Slow. Hey there. Hey there. Hey. Are you okay in there? Help me. Please make him go away. Oh. I'm just looking for my ball. What are you doing under here? I heard a baby crying. There's no babies under here, man. No? No. Come on. Hey, hey, em. What's crackin'? Hey, we're on time, right? No. Shop's closed. Baby, it's a saturday night. Please? This is the last time, okay? I got hours for business, too. Okay, I promise. Thank you. Thanks. A check? Are you for real? What the fuck's wrong with you, bitches? Come on, Emmett. It's from my trust account. It's golden. Emmett... Get out the way. You're blockin' my car. Asshole. What a dick. Hey, guys. Hey, Emmett, thanks for those clippers tickets, man. My kids had a blast. No problem. Hey, mom. Hey. Can you hand me that tape, Kelly? Sure. Thanks. What time's the party start tomorrow? Could use your help wrangling the hooligans. Bang on my door, find out. I ain't beggin', Emmett. But I sure could use your help. It's saturday night, ma. Count me in. Emmett, wake up. I need your help now. Oh, shit. Look, I'm sorry. I ended up oversleep-- Forget sorry. One of Andy's friends, Kade, is missing from the party. We think he walked out of the backyard. Everybody's searching the neighborhood and we're going, too. Okay, let me get dressed. I'll go, too. You let me down. I needed you, and you let me down. I'm sorry. Look, just pay the clown, okay? He's gathering his stuff up in the kitchen. You think you can do that? Yeah. Yo. Hey, man. What the fuck you doin' in my fridge? Close my fridge, man. What the fuck?! I said shut the fridge! You want the money? Close the fridge and get out my house. Yeah, it's a balloon. Okay, fucko. That's it, you're out. Get out my house. Get out! Out! Out! Get out! Emmett, watch out! Help! Someone! Stop! Leave him alone! Ow! Oh, shit! That fucker bit me! Baby, Emmett... Emmett, are you okay? Are you okay? I can't believe you got bit by a clown. This is disgusting. I hope he's not sick. Sick like how? Emmett, a clown bit you. That doesn't happen every day. Who knows what germs he's carrying, Diseases he's got. It's just plain wrong. It's okay, em. I'll take care of you. Oh, shit. You don't look so good. I'm fine. I'm just kinda hungry. Animal cracker? What am I, four? Yo, Emmett, hey. What up? Oh, look at that. Yeah. Oh, man. Whoa! Dude, that was fucking epic! Kelly. How's he doing? Okay. He's just a little-- I'm fine, ma. Andy asleep? Yes, took forever. That boy's been a mess ever since Kade up and walked off. Can't have me worrying about you, too. Nah, I'm fine. Kelly tried to poison me with some nasty ass cookies is all. The detectives wanna talk to you. I told them you were sleeping, but they said they need it for their report. Okay. No problem. I'll be right there. Let me put some clothes on. Are you okay? I wish I wasn't sleeping. Maybe I would have seen the kid walk off. Did both of you know everyone at the party? Yes. Except that clown. A clown? What clown? It was the clown that bit me. He was raiding through our fridge, so I kicked him out. You got bit by a clown? Yeah, I know, right? It's crazy. Right on my leg. Funny, I never heard of a clown biting before. Yeah, there was that one back in '88 at the marina. Oh, no, no, no, that wasn't a clown, that was a mime. No, it was a clown. Oh, no, no, Ray, that was a mime. That was a mime as sure as I'm sitting here. I know a clown when I see one, Sam. Yeah, well, you didn't see one at the Marina because it was a god damn mime. It was a god damn clown, okay? Look, let's just agree to disagree. How about that? Okay, sure, fine, 'cause you're wrong. I am not wrong! You're wrong! No, you're wrong! I know the difference between a god damn clown and a mime, okay? Okay, okay, okay! Anyway, it was a clown. He bit me. He ran off. He was very suspicious. You find the clown, you find the kid. I'm sure of it. What's the clown's name? I don't know. He didn't speak. Oh, well, then possibly it was just a mime then. Okay, the clown's name was fucko, okay? Fuck, fucko the clown, and he bit Emmett. A clown-- Not a mime, a clown. Write that down. Fucko. Strange name. Hmm. I've never heard of a clown named fucko. Can you tell us anything else about this clown? What was his act? What the hell? You would never hurt me, would you, Emmett? Never, Andy. I love you. You're my little brother. I'll always protect you. Then why am I so afraid of you? Jeez. Emmett my face. My skin was changing. Oh. Fuck! The urge to feed was strong. I wanted him-- Andy. I had to get away. You've gotta get some sleep. That was a long shift. I just wanted to stop by and see how everyone was doing before I crashed. I'm sorry I blew up last night. Oh, that's okay. I'm worried about Emmett. He'll be fine. What? What is going on? Come on! Mom's gotta have a long sleeve. You've been working too hard. And you know Emmett can be a handful. I don't know, Frances. He's been acting really strange lately... Ever since that clown bit him. If I didn't leave fast... I'm afraid of what I would've done. What did the doctor say? Good luck with that. Emmett is not gonna see a doctor. It's from Emmett. "Trouble. Gotta find that clown. Call you later." What does that mean? He's gone. He went to go look for the clown. Maybe he didn't know you were here. No, you don't understand. Something is wrong with him. I had to hide my face... Hide what I was becoming. I couldn't let anyone see me like this. I would live my life in the shadows... Silently walking... Prowling for the innocence... To consume. I never felt a hunger like this before. Something deep inside me... Fighting the inevitable. My mouth... Sealed shut as if my own body hates what it's becoming. What the hell am I? Kelly. Oh, my god. Emmett, where are you? Let me come and get you. Please don't. Whatever trouble you're in, I'll help you. It's my fault. I have to find the clown. Forget the clown, Emmett. Just come home. I have to tell you something. Tell Andy... I'll never hurt him. Emmett, please come home. Pull his shoes off! Come on, get his shoes off! I can't! They're stuck! His feet are too big! Feed me. Feed my urge. Once I tasted it, I wanted more. I needed more. Who sent this? "He's mine now." Where's Andy? Sleeping! Andy! My baby! Where are you taking me, Emmett? I'm scared, Emmett. Franks. Detective, we've got a child abduction on the corner of Ringling and Vargas. We're on our way. What are we doing here, Emmett? I just wanna go home now. You're not Emmett! Run, Andy! Run home! Thank you, sir. May I have another? Andy... Uh... I'm sorry, Andy. I didn't mean for you to see that. You'd never hurt me like that, would you, Emmett? Oh, no. No, Andy. I would never let that happen. Not to you. I would die first, Andy... Before I'd... Before I'd... Let myself hurt you. Then why am I so afraid of you? Run Andy! Run home, Andy! I'll never let myself hurt you! I'd die first, Andy. I'd die first, Andy. My brother Andy... Hands up, clowny! Nothing I wouldn't do for him. What the hell you do that for? Bang. There she is. Hey, lady, can we see your baby? Look at the size of his feet! L.A. Is a long way from the parish. And I sure as hell never expected to find true love In a city like this. But I did. And it was beautiful. He was beautiful. We were made for each other. We fit. He told me that. We had some days. We did. And I loved that man with every ounce of my being. The first few months after we were married were the happiest days of my life. We couldn't get enough of each other. I felt the power of his love. And my heart was full to bursting. I dreamed of someone like him. But never thought he existed. Just a little girl's dream. Back in New Orleans, my Gran Pere was known around the parish as a protector. He watched over folks, watched over me. Some may call him a conjurer, as he knew the ways of the old ones. Some say my Gran Pere could cast some spells. He blew what they called the goofer dust on me back then... And gave me some in a little vial that I wear today. He said it was the dirt my dead kin were buried in, said that his mojo would protect me when he weren't on this side of the grass no more, when the dirt reclaimed him. I never told anyone what it was. My gift from Gran Pere. I can't cry now or shed no more tears. But after a while, that man started treating me differently. Badly. A man's not supposed to lay hands on his woman Unless they lovin' hands. I'd wish it was like it was before. But I knew there were others. A woman knows. Our Gran Pere always said his granddaughter deserved to be loved. And if I ever had that love in my heart... It would never die. I knew he was a player. I just thought he was done playin'. I told him that I couldn't stand for no more cheatin'. I told him I deserved better. He didn't like that. He was my man. And I loved him... Even if he did that bad thing to me. And I have that love in my heart. And just like my Gran Pere promised... That love... Would never... Die. Like it or not... We would spend eternity... Together.
