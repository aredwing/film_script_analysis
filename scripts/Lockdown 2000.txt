Is that so hard to understand? Les be real about this, Krista. I got 10 years. Thas damn near half my life. The sooner we let go, the better off we'll both be. - I spoke with Charles Pierce. - Who? The college recruiter. He's here, and he wants to help. - You're not listening. - You're not listening to me! - You may be angry or embarrassed... - You don't know what is like! - What what is like? - To be a man and be locked down! Look, I'll see this man, but I'm telling you, don't come back. I went over your case. No one believed your alibi because your prints were found all over the gun. We found the thing! I was trying to throw it out. - I believe you. Thas why I wanna help. - You believe me? You come here four months after the fact and think you can change everything? I can try. But I am not gonna beg you. So you tell me... ...do you want my help? Yeah. What do I gotta do? For starters, you can sign this paper. It gives me the power to act on your behalf. - Is that it? - No. I need you to stay out of trouble. You've been here a few days and been caught with a shank. Time earned on the inside can stick no matter what I do. - Stay out of trouble. - Do you see where I am? I stand still and trouble will find me. You're the tough guy. You figure it out. Okay. Yeah. We're back in business, boys. Clean up, baby. Give me the laxative. I know you're pissed off about Louis... ...but don't do anything stupid. He wasn't part of your crew. Thas wrong, man. That nigger was part of my business. If you retaliate, the warden's gonna lock this place down... ...and there ain't gonna be no business. I'll take my paper at the end of the week. Fucking bitch. Motherfucker! How much shit he think we supposed to take? Fuck that motherfucker! Lefty, where are those razors you stole from supply? - I'll go get them. - Yeah. I've got a plan for that motherfucker. Whas up with you? - We straight. - So is Graffiti. - He's already working the cell block. - Okay. This is it, huh, nigga? Thas all I found. - You fucking with my shit! - Chill with that shit! - I ain't gonna cross you. - Don't play no games with me! I wouldn't cross you, man. Fuck! How am I gonna keep up with Graffiti like this? What we need is a mule without a record to bring some more product in. - What about your main girl? - Who, Avery? - Thought you didn't like him. - I got nothing against him. That shit on the court was a show. This here, nigga, is business. I'll talk to him. - Handle it, I'll cut you in on 15 percent. - All right. Shit. They fucking killed Nuke. Barkley! Lock them down. No movement. Yes, ma'am. - Whas this about? - Avery Montgomery. He was convicted for armed robbery and murder. I remember. They had the dog. They didn't have anything to do with the shooting. They had the gun, and the manager picked them out. After their faces were all over the 11:00 news. It could be because they did it. One of them tried to shoot me. I could be dead. We didn't come here to get into an argument. I appreciate that. What do you want from me? A few things bother me about your report. There was no food or wrappers found in the car... ...and one witness said the Mustang was a hardtop. - Can you think of any other inconsist...? - They had the gun and no alibis. They didn't do it, officer. I hear you. I don't wanna see someone in jail for something they didn't do. But everything I know is in my report. Have a good day. Thank you. Graffiti, man, I told you, I ain't with this shit. - God don't fucking like this! - Is cool! Fuck that, man! - Come on, man. - Motherfucker! You're my bitch! You wanna do a little dance? You wanna dance with Daddy? Here you go. How many's that? - Fifty. - I do a hundred a day. I ain't fucking around! There's Daddy. Run to Daddy, Jordan. - You ain't got nothing to say to him. - Fuck you! You're not listening to me, Avery. " I found a home... ...or a hole in the ground, as you will. But do not jump to the conclusion that because I... ...call my home a hole... ...it is damp and cold like a grave. Mine is a warm hole. And I say this to you because... ...it is incorrect to assume... ...that because I'm invisible... ...and live in a hole... ...I am dead." Thas Ralph Ellison. This shit ain't right. No hot food. No fresh air. - How long they gonna keep us in here? - As long as they want. As long as they want. You got a lot of fire in you, Avery. The only way you gonna make it through this is to calm yourself. You understand? It ain't easy. No, is not easy. Thas why they call it prison, young brother. Lockdown's over! Rise and shine! Les go, ladies! Fall out and fall in line! - That wasn't so bad, was it? - I'm behind in my mortgage. Demand is up. Is double-up time. I'm taking over this motherfucker. It was good to get your letter. I had a lot of time to think about your last visit, and I'm sorry. I know you didn't mean it. How's Jordan? He's good. He misses his daddy. His daddy misses him too. You wanna go outside? Yeah. You'd be surprised the things you value when you don't have them anymore. Like you. Jordan. I wouldn't mind getting back in that swimming pool neither. Yeah, I know. We talked to the police. That wasn't much help. We're trying to track down the manager of that burger stand. I don't know, maybe he'll change his testimony. Whatever. Have you seen Dre? No. They got us all separated. Won't be long before we're all hanging out again, though. We haven't heard from him. He hasn't returned our letters or called. Is real hard in here, you know? Real hard. But he's not that tough, and he looks up to you. So if you see him, have him call. Yeah, I'll do that. I promise. Okay. - Where you headed? - I'm going to see Dre. Hold my cards. Well, lookie here. What the hell you been doing, boy? I ain't been doing nothing. Are you saying I'm nothing? - Did I tell you you could leave this cell? - I just took a walk, all right? - I didn't tell you to leave, did I? - What the fuck? I tell you when you can come and when you go. When you eat, sleep, piss and drink! You understand me? Motherfucker! Fuck you! I'll fucking kill you! Kick some ass, white boy! - Stay the fuck down! - Kill him! Motherfucker! Fuck with me, motherfucker! Get off me! Get off me! Kill that motherfucker! Motherfucker! Fuck you! Get off me! Get off me! Come on. I'm sorry. - Let me go! - Take it easy! What about them? What about them? Shit! Goddamn it. That nigga Avery got some heart. Nigga handled his fucking business on Graffiti. That nigga ain't no punk. With that nigga being isolated, he can't make no moves with us. - That fucks up my game. - They let them white boys walk. Is over for them niggas, though. Whas up? Get the fuck out of the way. - Fuck, nigga, I'm working! - Move! - Get your ass the fuck back! - Let a real motherfucker through! I'm tired of you, nigga! I know you ain't raising your hands at me! Sit down! I got a better idea for that fool. Since that nigga hot, we gonna cool him off. - Put that motherfucker in the freezer! - Fuck you! Fuck both y'all niggas! Fuck y'all! Fuck y'all! Fuck y'all! Bitch-ass niggas! Let me go, nigga! Fuck y'all, niggas! No, fuck you, nigga. Freeze. Open three. You're blowing it, man. He had it coming. You're found guilty of assault in here, you'll do time, no matter what. - I said, he had it coming! - Spare me the tough convict talk. - It fails me, my friend. - Friend? Man, you don't know me. You don't know where I've been. And is hard in this motherfucker. Is not supposed to be easy. And you just made it that much tougher on yourself. I'm here because I believe you didn't shoot that girl. You got a raw deal. I'm trying to give a man who deserves it a chance. What am I supposed to think? I'm locked down in here, my family's out there. You're supposed to have faith. Shit, I'm trying! Every time I hear the cell doors close, man... ...I lose a little bit more. Look, tomorrow you go before the disciplinary committee. I'll try to think of something. You just hold on. Everybody here? Good. First up, the board would like to see... Excuse me. My name is Malachi Young... ...and if it pleases the board, I'd like to go first. Hold on. Mr. Young, the board will see you. Come this way. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Have a seat, Mr. Young. The report says you're responsible for one inmate in the infirmary... ...with a broken nose... ...another with a fractured cheek... ...and another with an injury to the back and head. We've already heard from the officers on duty... ...at the time of the assault. Being the senior inmate in this incident, what do you have to say? I would say that I'm guilty. And that I'm totally responsible for everything that went on. Are you aware of what you're saying, Mr. Young? I'm totally aware of what I'm saying. The problem is, you motherfuckers don't know us. You motherfuckers don't know me. I been locked down in here for 18 years. Them young niggas don't know how to run shit. This is my house! I run this motherfucker! You know what I'm saying? I run this motherfucker! I run this motherfucker! This is my fucking house! I will kill you, motherfucker! You hear me? I run this motherfucker! - See what I'm talking about? - Whas the deal? Heard your boy walked at the board, huh? Right, right. There's only one problem, though. - Graffiti's still in the game. - Don't worry about it. Now that Avery back in circulation... ...l'm gonna hit him with the deal. I think I got an idea, boy... ...how to take Graffiti out of the game forever. But I'm gonna need your help. Whas up? Put me on. Shoot the ball, then. I'm gonna tell you about it. Maximum security, huh? After my little performance, you know... ...they didn't have much choice. Look, I done max before. I can do it again. Maybe I wasn't ready to get out anyway. Young, les get a move on. Could we have one more second? Look, maybe when I get out, we'll hook up. - You can teach me how to swim. - I'll do that. - Yo, Mal. - Yeah? Thank you for everything. I mean it. I want you to have this. - I can't. Thas the only copy. - I want you to take it. Maybe you'll find some strength in it. I always have. Come on, Young, les go. You a bad little nigga, Dre. Jumping all over Graffiti like that. Your ass is crazy. What was I supposed to do, wait for you, man? I wanted to do something, you know? But I ain't want no trouble. Thas why I'm up in here now. Think that scrimmage you had with Graffiti is over? Well, you better get your mind right. He want his little black bitch back. Word is he gonna cut your ass first chance he gets, thas for sure. Look, fuck Graffiti, all right? I fucked him up. He know not to fuck with me. Whare you talking about? You ain't gotta prove that to me, nigga. Yo, Dre, we go back, man. I know we ain't been tight since we been up in here... ...but I ain't trying to see nothing happen to you in here. What are you talking about? What he talking about is, you need to get that nigga before he get you. Thas for sure. Better get your mind right, though. I got some of that cure, boy. Is the real shit.
