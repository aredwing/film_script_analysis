Don't go there!

Some new Shinki came in at Ken's shop! Really? Let's bring ours! Yeah, let's go! Hey! Where's that shop? Can I come with you? Huh? He's the transfer student. C'mon, let's go! Heck yeah! On Sale! Every kid who lives in this town dreams of being one thing: The master of a Shinki. I've always dreamed of having a Shinki, who would be my friend through thick and thin. What's this Shinki doing here? That's terrible. Were you thrown away? Shinki shouldn't be able to defy orders. Bring her back without fail. As long as the CSC is still functional, I should be able to reactivate it. All I have to do is transmit the data for repair, and reboot. You'll be fine. I'll fix you right up. Please, move. Won't work, huh? Guess I'll have to send it in for repairs. Front Line unit. Angel-type Arnval Mk.2. Operational. She moved. She spoke! Yay! H-Hello there! Nice to meet you, Master. Master? I guess you're right! From now on, I'm your master! Master, please give me a name. A name? Oh, right. You've got a point. I'm your master, so I have to give you a name... Name... Oh, right. Kaguya. Name recognized and recorded. As your partner, I pledge to fulfill a Shinki's duties. I look forward to our cooperation. Th-The honor is all mine! How silly. The heartbeat thumping in my tiny, tiny chest is full of big hopes and fears We can spend the time together without haste, simplying enjoying it Promise Just dreaming and nothing else is boring, you said, laughing, and hid your embarrassment The second our feelings reached the other, our time of happiness began Let's fly away Good night, Master. Good night, Kaguya. Is this the wrong one too? Where the hell are you? I can't allow you to enter the world of humans. Checking her systems revealed nothing. This is impressive. You fixed her all by yourself, Tsubasa. She's the impressive one. Though she acted like a child in the beginning. A child? She has no memories of the time before she was thrown away, but she's really smart and remembers basically everything at once. Of course. It's all thanks to my master, who made me. Hey, Ken. Can I disconnect her now? Sure. There's nothing wrong with her. All right! It's gotten late, so take care on the way home. Odd things have been happening lately. It has to do with the Shinki, right? I heard Arnval types are getting attacked. The attacker is supposedly another Shinki, but how could a Shinki be so evil? I agree. Humans are definitely behind it. I've got to be careful so Kaguya stays safe. So long. Seeya. Is something wrong? Oh, it's nothing. I'm sure I'm imagining it. Tomorrow's our first battle. You should get some rest. Oh yeah, if we manage to win tomorrow, I want to give you a present. A present? Yeah. To reward you for your efforts. For me? In that case, there's no way I'll lose! Kaguya... For my master's sake, I promise to win! Nice to meet you! Yo there. Ready. Light-On! Go. After scanning you, you seem to be an old custom model. Sorry, but this battle... is mine! You're better than I expected. My master customized my equipment. I won't lose! Kaguya! Now! Okay! Take this! All right! Kaguya, you did it! Kaguya? Stop! Wait! Don't do it! Don Kaguya... Stop it, Kaguya! Kaguya! Why you... What the hell did you do to your Shinki?! That's illegal! Answer me! I-I'm sorry. "Sorry" ain't gonna fly! Is that all you have to say? What are you going to do to make up for this?! Don't pretend it was an accident! It's obviously an illegal model. Seriously, kids today have no principles. Isn't that a criminal offense? That Arnval... Haven't there been attacks on Shinki? Shinki aren't supposed to be able to fight without orders. I've heard Shinki are being attacked by another Shinki! She did it! No! Look at her hands! The color! It's growing. This is weird. Talk about creepy! Grab her! Kaguya! Hold it! Kaguya! Stop! Kaguya... Kaguya! Kaguya! Mas Where'd she go? Did she get away? The kid's gone. She can't have gotten far. We can't let that dangerous Shinki get away! I agree. I'm sure even that cat has a home. I wonder if I could go back to my master? You... Who are you? Why are you doing this? I'm just looking for something important. I have to find out if you're the real thing. She's fast! The Black Arnval... Found you. I've finally found you, Type 01! Why didn't you listen to me? I told you not to run. I'm sorry, Daddy. Now, let's go home. Okay. Kaguya... Are you looking for Kaguya? Ken! I've finally found you, Type 01! Type 01? My name is Kaguya. No. You're an autonomous combat robot. Type 01. What? Autonomous combat? I'm just a Shinki! You may look like a Shinki, but your inner workings are completely different. We are special robots constructed as part of an experiment. However, you fled. You are disobeying your master's order. I don't remember anything! There are people who need you. Please come back with me. I can't do that. I have a different master now. I have a master who made me! This is for his own good! You saw your true strength, right? We are special. We are not meant for normal humans. Come with me to where you belong. For his own good... Yes. Serve your master. That's our duty. Now, let's go home. Together. Arnval and Strarf. The two are experimental models, and have special programs installed on them. I believe it caused Kaguya to go berserk. Experimental? What for? Why do you know that? Long ago, I worked a certain job. I helped with the development of the software. I had no idea they would use it to develop weapons. Weapons? Are you telling me Kaguya was built as a weapon? I think I did something horrible to you two. I'll go find her. I couldn't protect her. I was scared, and I couldn't move. I was afraid of Kaguya! I was afraid of her when she went berserk, but she looked at me so sadly... I... I... have a duty as her master! If that's how you feel, then give her a warm welcome when she comes home. Ken... I know where she's headed. They can only resume the experiments with both of them there. The project team will want to take her back at all costs. I'll tell you if I find her. Go back home. Wait! I'll come with you. This time... This time, I'll be sure to protect her! So much time has passed. Finally, it all comes to fruition. You really are amazing. Well done, 02. You honor me, Master. Scans complete. All is in order. Continue with the final experiment. Nostalgic, isn't it? This is where your home is. This is where you were born. Here, we slept side by side. I remember a little... I lied here, just like this, and looked at the sky outside the window. I imagined what the outside world might be like. Was it anything like your imagination? Not in the slightest. But it was very wonderful. I'll never see my master again, will I? Remember the time we spent together. We will finally be the foundation of a great experiment. Kaguya is in there. What are they planning on doing with Kaguya? Before they continue the experiments, they'll erase any unnecessary data. They'll erase her emotions. Then what about Kaguya? Let's focus on getting in first. There's a sewage pipe over there. We should be able to sneak in through there. That night... I ran away. If I ever get away from here again... there's something... I really... really... have to say. Something very important. Before I fade away, before all I am fades into oblivion, I have to talk about the sadness in her eyes. What's going on? We don't know! The systems aren't responding! Why? Why are you ruining it all? Kaguya! I know you! You used to be on the research staff! I've come to get her back. She's his friend! Kaguya! Don't! That's dangerous! Kaguya! Caught you. Here... Here... This is the present I got for you. I'm here to protect you. Kaguya. Master? I'm sorry I left you alone. Let's go home. Master... Tsubasa... You came here for me. Yes. Now let's get out of here. Beginning systems check. Ascertaining current situation. No threats detected. Movement free of irregularities. Why did she activate? We don't know! The safeguards have all broken down. Don't tell me that Kaguya and 02 Ken! She's the all-purpose autonomous humanoid weapon system, Athena! But without both Arnval and Strarf here, she should be like a newborn child, unable to even walk! Beginning parallel tests, Master. "Master"?! Run, you fools! She's armed with live ammunition for her exercises! What? What about the safeguards?! Did you bastards Something went wrong. Athena's no longer under our control. But... Can you shut her down? Impossible. She won't respond. Issue evacuation orders. What about 01 and 02? We have a backup. We can leave them. Let them have 01 if they want. Tsubasa... All clear, Master. Resuming tests. No errors. No errors. She doesn't have full control over herself after all. Let's run, Tsubasa! Right! Please wait! Kaguya! Wait! Wait! Come back, 02! She's out of control! Welcome, my CSC. Well met, body of mine. She will destroy you! It's true that if you and Athena merge, you might be able to stop her from going out of control. But this place is falling apart! There's nothing we can do about it! They said they had a backup. We were built and raised so that we would one day merge with Athena. You had the chance to see a lot of things in the outside world, but I only remember obedience to my master. I'm an autonomous unit. Even without my master's presence, I can fulfill his orders. Because I'm amazing. That's what he told me. "Amazing." It was his order. So... Farewell, Kaguya. Confirming Type 02, CSC. Beginning synchronization. Resuming synchronization on auto. Resuming final tests. Damn it. She's not getting better! You two go ahead. I'll go to Athena and 02. I'm 01, you know. She's 02. I'm her sister. Kaguya... I'll stay here too. I don't understand all this talk of tests and research, but I know that Strarf is important to you. So I appreciate it! But please understand me. I Tsubasa, take this. Is this... Light-On gear? You can connect to her even here with this. Ken. If you connect to a Shinki, your power increases exponentially. It should be the same with Kaguya. Thank you. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I got you involved in such dangerous things. Don't worry. Right now, we need to focus on Strarf. Athena is coming! Tests completed. Constant levels of performance confirmed. Updating mission parameters. Located unit 01. Let's go, Kaguya! Okay! Light-On! Verifying Unit 01 as target. Commencing hostilities. She's fast! Out of the way, Kaguya! Use the laser rifle! Okay! Did it work? Tsubasa! Move it! Ken! Kaguya! Tsubasa! Let's go! Okay! Do it! My CSC... I'm sorry. Wake up! How beautiful... It's so bright it hurts my eyes... Welcome! 'Sup! We came to help out. Okay, unpack the parcels, then. Got it! Here it is. All right! My very own Shinki! Every kid who lives in this town dreams of being one thing: The master of a Shinki. What are you doing there? I thought I'd wrap it up nicely since it's for a customer. I was the same. Here, Master. Thanks. At first I didn't understand anything at all, and I was full of doubt, but being a master isn't all that hard. You just have to treasure her. Shinki are our partners. They're the best friends you could have. You did not care when they tied you to the cross You did not care when they tied you to the cross I wish to be with you, to have you see me I am drowning in forbidden love There is no truth to this A love you see on every corner transforms us all into incompetents I want you to look only at me Is that too much to ask? I love you, but you are too close I love only you, burn with love I know the sadness of lonely nights You did not care when they tied you to the cross I wish to be with you The frail love of the cross I want you to look only at me Is that too much to ask? I love you, but you are too close I love only you, burn with love I know the sadness of lonely nights You did not care when they tied you to the cross I wish to be with you The frail love of the cross
