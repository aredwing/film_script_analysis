( Laughter ) Privilege sure does build confidence, doesn't it? - Ernie: Mm-hmm. - Why? - What? - Why do you want to be in business with a man like me? I mean, you obviously don't need the money. But this isn't about circumstances, is it? - Black, white... - ( Phone ringing ) ...rich or poor... - Yeah, what's up, primo? - Circumstances are for faggots, aren't they? ( Laughs ) Yeah. Yeah, all right, thanks. You see, men are guided by their desires. You desire to leave your circumstances. - Oh yeah. - You desire to turn your back on the safety net of vanilla-land over there and get a little... a little downtown sprinkled on you. Maybe have some excitement, take some risks, maybe make a little pocket change you don't have to ask daddy for. That'd be a good thing, right? Hey, boss... ( Whispers ) See, Ernie... Ernie here is different. - ( Chuckling ) - He has needs. - He needs to feel important. - Yeah, fuck right, he does. See, Ernie, Ernie needs to be more than just a chauffer. That's why he's brought you to me. And Ernie needs to be more than just my collector, and that's why he's introduced me into your world. - That's right. - That's right. He also needs to prove to the FBI that he knows all about my operations, and that is why Ernie's a dead man. Simon... ( Groaning ) Holy fuck, man! Dude, what the fuck is that? ( Screaming, coughing ) Dylan: Whoa, man! - ( Moans ) - Jesus Christ, man! Yo, listen to me! - I-i did not mean to... - ( Mocking stammer ) No. See, Dylan... you didn't think. You just desired. - ( Blows thudding ) - ( Ernie groaning ) Shit, man. Dude, you can't do this. No, see, i can because this is my world and my desires rule. - I can... i can pay you. - Look... what? - Let me pay you, man! - I'm sure you can. ( Sobs ) Kill him. - Logan: No, wait! Stop! Run, Dylan, run! - ( Gunshots ) - ( Gunshot ) - Save it, save it, save it. - Save it, save it. Get rid of him. - ( Ernie coughs ) - Ernie: Please, Simon. - We got a small problem. Oh God.

( Gasping ) And, Dylan, what the fuck are you talking about, killing us? Man, what the hell did you guys do up there, okay? - What the fuck did you do? - Listen, Chloe, it's all right. It's all right. We just gotta go get up top and call the cops. I don't see 'em, guys. I don't see 'em. Maybe they're not coming. Of course they're coming, you dumb shit! - Get the fuck off me, man! - They're gangsters. We saw what they did. They're coming and they're gonna keep coming - until they kill us all. - Oh, that's my fault, huh? Logan: Who's fault is it? - You okay, Sam? - Yeah. Look, man, i didn't know, okay? You didn't know? - Dylan, what were you doing? - That's enough. - Tell me! - That's enough! What the fuck did you think you're doing down there? Look, while we're here arguing, - what do you figure they're doing? - ( Gunshot ) - Fuck! - You missed? Shit! Fuck you, all right? You're a fuckin' pussy, bitch! ( Thugs arguing ) ( Kids shouting ) - ( Screams ) - Go go go. Come on... Sam, Sam! - ( Shouting in Spanish ) - What the fuck? Speak English. What'd you say? - ( Groans ) Don't start with me, boss. - You're in America now. - It's your fault. - All my fault? We had them and you let them go. Bro, you had 'em! If you was good at some shot... what's going on? The kids... they ran down the platform. I think they went behind that blue construction thing back there. So relax, okay? They've done us a favor. Most of the train stations this part of Brooklyn are either shut down or sealed off. Bones, take chulo, go out to the club and handle that shit before the cops get there. Yo, boss, why i gotta go with him? He crazy, boss. Hey, chulo, why don't you do what you're told? Come on! All right. You got your flashlight on you? Yeah, boss.

If you touch it, you die. Just stay away from it. - What? - It's okay, be careful. - Come on, we gotta keep going, you guys. - Let's go, come on! We gotta go. We gotta go, come on! - Come on. - ( Sizzles ) Stay with me. Just follow the light. - You guys handle everything at the spot? - Everything cool, jefe. All right, good. Let's keep moving. Smalls. Ha, this rich kid's got balls. I'm gonna enjoy ripping 'em off and feeding 'em to him. All right, let's go.

( Chloe groans ) What are you doing? There's a staircase. It's gotta lead out. If the exit's locked, your "friends" could trap us in there. Hey, what did he mean "your friends"? - Logan: Cover your eyes. - Chloe: What? ( Shrieks ) Shhh! Keep your voices down. They could be close. What? If they come this way, just take off. - What? - What about you? Hey, stay here with the girls. Hold it low to the ground. Give me some light going in. When I'm out of range, turn it off! ( Coughs ) Oh man. ( Squeaking ) Shh-shh-shh. Oh man. Dylan? - Dylan? - Shh. Chloe: What does he mean? Why did he call these gangsters your friends? Shut up, Chloe. Logan said just keep your voice down, okay? I know. - ( Grate screeches ) - ( Grunts ) - What did he mean? - Would you shut up? - Just shut up. - Dylan, i just need to know what he meant. Stop freaking asking me questions. I'm freaking asking you questions because I'm freaking out. I don't fucking know, okay? Just shut up. - Dylan, just tell me. What? - Jesus! What? Fuck you! You know what, Dylan? You really suck sometimes. - ( Neck cracks ) - ( Sighs ) I'm so glad i never had sex with you. Get off me. I said get off of me! - Stupid bitch. - ( Gasps ) What? Oh! ( Chloe sobs ) - What? - "Sweets come to the sweet. " - Sh-hh... - oh, fuck you. Ain't no justice. Let me see the light. Okay, let's go. Don't pay attention to him. He's an asshole. Yeah. So... You never did it with Dylan? Nope. But everybody thinks... we're, like, going at it every two seconds. I know. That's what you're supposed to think, dummy. Why? Because there's no such thing as a cool virgin, that's why. You know, Dylan said i was being stupid, but i, um... I just wanted my first time to be special. ( Sniffles ) I don't think it's stupid... To want your first time to be special. Yeah. Well. Probably never gonna live to do it anyways now, so... ( Grunts ) ( Water flowing ) ( Jessica whispers ) Logan! Where's he at? - You okay? - Yeah. He's taking a long time, guys. I don't even know what he's doing. No way back. - ( Bottle clatters ) - Shit. - ( Chloe gasps ) - Sam: Oh shit. - Dylan: It's okay. - Sam: Shit, go. ( Whispers ) Logan!

Come on. - Logan! - Let's go. Now! Come on, come on, come on. Let's move. Come on. We should go this way. Ugh, it smells like piss down here. Anybody home? Looks like bums been sleeping back there. - ( Rats hiss, chitter ) - ( Yelps ) Ah!

Just keep moving. Chloe: Shit! Dylan: Oh shit. Jessica: Shh shh! Ahhh! - Jesus! - ( Chulo laughs ) Dead end, motherfuckers! All right, children, now get your hands up on your pretty little heads. We're gonna meet the man. - Get 'em up! - ( Gasps ) Let's go. Get him outta here. Let's go! Come on, let's go. Move! Come on, let's go.

" - ( Sobbing ) - Huh? You like it rough, don't you? Leave her alone. ( Gasps ) - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Feeling left out? - No no. Girls always battling for attention, huh? - Jessica: I'm not, I'm not. - Come on, man, get off her. - ( Jessica sobs ) - The fuck did you just say? ( Exhales ) ( Chuckles ) Oh. Chulo. This little pussy's got nerve. Come on, man. That your girlfriend? - Come on. - You ain't even got the fuckin' balls to stand by your woman. You fuckin' faggot. That must mean she's up for grabs. Huh? - Say it. Say it. - Uh... Say i could have her. Say it. Shh. Say it. Go on. Say it. I could have her. - ( Whimpers ) Yo, man... - if you don't say it, I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out. Say it! Bones, bones, bones. Stop torturing the punk. Yeah, we'll have our fun later. Let's get them back. - Let's go. - ( Chloe whimpers ) Put your hands up on your head!

What's that, some kind of fucking trade-off? Small: Damn, bones. - What a way to go out. - ( Chuckles ) It's almost funny, ain't it? They're still running because they still think they're alive. ( Sizzles ) But they're dead. Every last one of 'em. - Wait! - ( Logan vomits ) - Dylan: What's wrong? - ( Logan grunts ) - Logan. - What's wrong, Logan? - ( Sighs ) - Jessica: What happened?

I watched him die. ( Whimpers ) No. I watched the light go out of his eyes. ( Gasps ) What, are you... you surprised, huh? - ( Chloe sobbing ) - What did you think would happen? Who the fuck did you think you were dealing with? Dylan, what is he talking about? Go on. Tell her. Tell her why your friend died. Tell her why we're all gonna die in this fucking rat-infested subway tunnel! Dylan, what is he talking about? - ( Girls sobbing ) - Know why you were invited to this party? Huh? No. Jessica: No. No. It was so Dylan could have a little sit-down with delacorte and his gang to peddle their filthy fucking drugs in your school. Isn't that right? Oh, Dylan, no. - No. - You and me, man. You and me, we were born with everything. Everything! - This is the best you can do? - I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry Sam's dead. ( Jessica sobs ) Chloe: Sorry? You just don't get it. I didn't mean for this to happen. - Chloe! - I can't. I can't. No, this is way too much, Dylan. Chloe, listen to me. Jess. ( Grunts ) Get off me. You selfish asshole. ( Sobs ) ( Sighs ) ( Chloe sobbing ) ( Rumbling ) Wha... you feel that? Yeah, i feel it too. - Logan: It's getting closer. - Oh no. - ( Chloe gasping ) - A train.

Oh, you ain't gettin' this watch back! ( Speaks Spanish ) Fuck it. Somebody got in here to write on the walls, so there must be a way out. - Chloe, where are you going? - I think i found a door! If the train got him, we'd have seen him, Logan. Yeah. He'll turn up. You'll see. ( Scoffs ) It's not like he'd be worried about me. That's why he's Dylan and you're you. Yeah. You know, everything's just come to him so easy. It... it's made him spoiled and arrogant. You left out selfish and corrupt. ( Chuckles ) Yeah. He's got some good stuff in him too though. ( Footsteps ) Damn it, the hallway down there is blocked off too. Come on. ( Chattering ) Someone please help me get out of this place. Hey, man, how do i get out of here?

( Sighs ) Will somebody please help me get out of here? Come with me. ( Footsteps ) The way out is that way. All right, man. All right, thanks, man. But if you want to find your friends, they're that way. How do... hey, how do you know? Hey. Hey. Hey! How do you know? Hey!

No. Smalls, go with him. Make sure he doesn't get his ass killed. Huh-uh. You fucked up. I'll lead. ( Sighs ) This is bullshit. - Logan: Come on, shh shh. - Chloe: I can't, i can't.
