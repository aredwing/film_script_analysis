No mistake possible? No. How far? Two months almost. You, uh... You didn't give the doctor your right name, did you? No. He knew I was lying. It was awful. You shouldn't have gone alone. I should have gone with you. What are we gonna do? Well... I know you want me to say we'll get married right away but... Don't want to get out of it, do you? Don't even think that. I love you. Oh, I love you. I want to marry you, more than anything else in the world, only your... - He doesn't matter. - He's your father. He does. What he thinks is important. All I know is we don't have any choice. Look, honey... I know this is a shock, but it isn't the end of the world. Sure, it's a problem, but a thing like this can change, Dory. - No. - There's always a chance. You know that. I suppose so. Dory... Come on. Come on. That's better. Come on, honey. We'd better go. My mother will be home soon. - OK? - OK. Hm? I don't feel good. - I can't even eat. - Well, that's natural. I know, but the girls in the sorority house are gonna start asking questions. Well, I know what we can do about that, Dory. A friend of mine - Hermy Gosset. Remember him? One of his cousins owns a pharmacy. Hermy works there nights. Maybe he'd give me something to make you feel better. - You won't say anything, will you? - No, of course not. Oh, Dory... Come on, will ya stop worrying? Everything's going to be all right. OK. Come on, honey. We'd better go. Be careful you don't leave anything around. - It's not right. - What? For anyone to love somebody as much as I love you. That makes us even. Then we haven't got anything to worry about. Haven't you heard? Love conquers all. - Hello, son. - Hi, Mother. - Had your dinner? - No. I'm not hungry. - There's a sandwich in the kitchen. - I don't feel like anything. - You've gotta eat something. - Why? - Aren't you feeling well? - Mother, will ya, please? There's something wrong. You can't fool me. I know you too well. Mother, please! Will ya? It's just that I have to get something special ready for a speech tomorrow. I haven't much time to do it in. - You work too hard. Play more. - I haven't any time. A person's gotta relax sometime. Look, Mother, I'm 25 years old. Where am I? No place. I don't wanna wind up like Dad, with holes in my shoes. You're not like him. Not at all. You'll see. Anything you decide to do, you'll do it. - I know. - Sure, I'm a genius. I think so. - Hi. - Hi. Any change? Nope. Well, I think we ought to decide and set a date. You're not mad, are you? No. Of course not. Don't be so unhappy about it. I know it's not the way we planned but... it'll be all right. Sure. It'll be great. - I'll quit school, get a job. - No! No, you won't have to. You'll get more money from the government because you have a wife. $105 a month. Well, other people get along. Soda jerk. How does that sound? I had such plans. Everybody expected so much of me. It's all my fault. It's always the girl's fault. Maybe there is a way. We could call your father... No! But we could appeal to him, tell him we did a terrible thing. It won't do any good! I know him. I know the way he feels about me. - But, Dory, all we have to... - No! We'll get along. - Prove to him that we don't need him. - I'm only... I don't even want him! Look, for the first time in my life I feel like me. I'm not Dorothy any more. That's my father's daughter and his property. I'm Dory now because you said so. Oh, sure. Sure, I've done wonders for you. I really have. New name, new address... Poverty Row, it'll be. Oh, no. I'm gonna be rich. Don't you see? I'll have everything I ever wanted. I'll have somebody to love and to take care of. And I'll have somebody to love me just for myself. OK, honey. We'll go down to the municipal Friday and... - Why Friday? - A few days won't make any difference. Be practical, honey. There's things to take care of - the license and... Besides, if we go Friday, we'll have the whole weekend for our honeymoon. That's right. Oh, it's exciting, isn't it? Let's go somewhere, huh? I can't, Dory. I've got a chem lab and a ton of Spanish. I wanna get things cleared away, so we'll be free. OK. I'll get to work, too. Oh, I love you. You don't wanna get out of it, do you? Silly. Who wants out? - Call me? - Yeah, first chance. - Dory? - Hm? You haven't told anybody? Your sister, or? - No. But I thought I ought to. - Is that wise? Ellen's all right. She'll understand. She'll even help. I was thinking. Maybe we ought to keep it our little secret, until after the wedding. OK. Anything you say. - Are you all right? - Yes. - You had me worried. - Oh, it's all right. - Bye. - Bye. - Hey! Hey, Kingship. - Oh... - You forgot our appointment last night. - Gordon, I'm sorry. I wasn't feeling well. Listen, young lady. I've got a reputation to protect. No one I've tutored thus far has flunked out, so I don't want you starting anything. I'm gonna be busy next week, but what do you want me to do? Run over chapter 14 and try the problems, will you? - And I am sorry. Bye. - Bye. - You in Albertson's class? - No. What's with him, anyway? I don't know. He's... he's like that, I guess. Now, did he say aldehydes or ketones? Aldehydes. I wish he wouldn't talk like he had a mouthful of mush. - Well, so long. - So long. I'm not much good without my notebook. Let me see your notes. Try it with ether. I'm sure they'll fit. I made them the same size as the other ones. They're beautiful. I want to do everything for you. And I will. Finish your hamburger, will ya? Dory, you remember that picture of me I gave you? - Mm-hm. - Could you lend it to me? I'd like to have some copies made. Mother wants to send some to relatives. - Have you told her yet? - No, I didn't think it was fair. You're not telling your family. I'm dying to meet her. What's that? That's me a couple of years ago. Pretty skinny, huh? That's Dad, that's Ellen. It was her birthday. She got a hi-fi set. She's crazy about Debussy. Not bad. A little beat. I think it's very handsome. And I want it back. Come on, honey. It's getting late. Just a kiss before dying When you kiss me goodbye Darling? I've been meaning to ask you, can we go to the prom? But you didn't want us to be seen around. All the out-of-the-way places we've been to. I just didn't want it to get back to Dad that I was going steady. It doesn't matter now. Do you really wanna go to the prom? Please. Then that's where you're gonna go. Hi. I'm struggling with this Spanish. I'll help you after class. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Last time, I'm afraid the bell interrupted us at a time when we were developing several major concepts. Because of that, it might be a good idea if we were to review some of the ground that we covered. I might point out to you, if I may, that our relationship demands eventually a certain testing programme. It's a good idea to pay attention to what I'm saying, and to this diagram on the board. We discussed the Trinitarian aspect of it. When we read in the works of Edwards, particularly, we saw a painful thing. We saw a man trying to reconcile predestination with free will - and not succeeding, of course. We discussed Puritanism, you may remember. Remember that, with its concept of predestination, you have what is essentially a pessimistic philosophy. It might, in fact, even be called theological determinism. And then later we came to what I like to call rationalism. It's variously called other things. The age itself is called the Age of Reason or the Age of Enlightenment. I think that psychologically... - Hello? - Dory? Me. - Listen, I've got to see you right away. - I can't come out. I just washed my hair. It's important, Dory. - Is it anything to do with tomorrow? - Yes. - Something's wrong? - Just the opposite. It's wonderful news. Tell me! Uh-uh. I want to see your face when I tell you. - You can meet me, can't you? - Where? - How about the fountain? 15 minutes OK? - OK. Bye. - Hi! - Hi, Annabelle. - Boy, have I been operating. - You sound like it. Yeah. I ran into this fella I used to know. He's the assistant manager at the Desert Palms. He thinks he can get us a bungalow for the weekend for a few bucks! - Wonderful! - Yeah. Yeah. I'm on my way to see him about it now. - Now how's that for luck? - You feel better about it, don't you? I admit, I was nervous at first. But it's going to work out. I know it is. Before I forget... I saw Hermy today. He gave me these. - What are they? - For you. I feel fine now. They're not for your stomach, Dory. They're vitamins. Hermy just got some samples in. He's gonna order some more for us. A fine mother you'll be. You don't keep up with the latest developments. These were in the medical journals last month. Dutiful father. I suppose you know everything that's in them. I don't have to. I know Hermy. Darling, I know you can't go to the doctor yet, but I do want you to start taking care of yourself. - Well? - Nothing. Use your handkerchief. The gelatin might melt. You're supposed to take them after dinner. You can do that when you get back home. If you don't care about your family's health, I do. Listen, honey, I gotta go. I gotta meet Stanley. Good night, Dory. - Good night. - Sweetheart? Both of them. - Hello? - Dory? Me. I just saw Stanley. We got the deal. That's wonderful. Yeah, yeah. I already put down a deposit on it to seal it. - Dory, did you take the capsules? - Yes. - When? - Just a few minutes ago. Dory? Listen, I forgot to tell you. They might hurt a little, burn or give you some pains, but don't get frightened. Hermy said that some people are allergic to them at first. - But you don't have to call anyone. - All right. - See you tomorrow? - Uh-huh. - Good night. - Goodbye, baby. Oh, thanks. You're the greatest. - You want some eggs? - No, thanks. I don't want to be late. Mother? Pick one. Mother, I've been thinking. Maybe I'm wasting my time at the university. - What do you mean? - I thought I'd quit school, get a job. I don't know... I've got an idea. Why don't you quit work early tonight? We can go out to dinner, catch an early show. - Oh, you don't want to go out with me. - You're still my best girl, aren't you? I've been neglecting you lately. Tell Mr. Muller you've got a date. With your son. We'll see. What is it? What's wrong? Darling? It's my side, where I was wounded. I get a twinge once in a while. - I thought it was a heart attack! - I'm fine now. Go back in class. - Do you have them very often? - Dory, the lecture's beginning. - I want to stay here with you. - You can't! I mean, I got something important to do, and I gotta do it right now. - Now will you go back in class? - I don't want to. - Then go to the house. - But, darling... Dory, I can't stand here! Last night, about 9.30. I gotta get it back! It was mailed by mistake. - I'd like to help, but it's too late. - What do you mean? It'll be delivered in an hour or so. Hello? - Dory? Me. - Are you all right? Yeah, fine, fine. Just fine. - Are you ready? - What, now? Didn't I tell you? There's no point in waiting. Meet me at Congress, by the clock, at 12.15. You can make it, can't you? - All I have to do is change. - Good. I'd better bring something along to prove I'm over 18. - Dory, it's still our secret, isn't it? - Of course. Remember now. 12.15 sharp, OK? OK. Hello, husband. I'm sorry I'm so late. After you. - Wait for me! - Nervous bridegroom. Now, how dumb can you get?! I should have called first. 20 minutes yet. - Let's go have a Coke. - Why don't we go up to the roof? I bet we can see for miles. Last chance to see the world as a single woman. Let's walk. All right. - It's beautiful. - Mm-hm. - Look at that sky. - Mm, it's so bright. Honey, look. The campus. Look! You can almost see the house. Boy, are those girls gonna be surprised. They don't even know I'm going with you. I feel so good, I can't tell you. - You gonna write your sister or phone? - Phone. Who can wait for letters? - You'll like Ellen, you'll see. - I'm sure I will. Darling... you're not sorry about the way things turned out, are you? Of course not. You know, I lied to you. - You know those pills you gave me? - Mm-hm. - I didn't take them. - Why not? I'm so ashamed, I don't know how to say it. It's just that, well, I knew how you felt about the baby. At first, anyway. I was afraid you might wanna... Oh, it doesn't matter. Anyway, I'm very ashamed. But I'm glad I told you. It's no way to start a marriage, with deceit. I forgive you. Don't look down. You might get dizzy. You're really very sweet. No fooling. The sweetest, gentlest person I've ever known. - You're prejudiced. - No. It's true. I love you. I really do. I believe you. The thing is, you'll never really know how I love you. I mean, no one can really understand the way the other loves. I don't believe that. It's true, Dory. It really is. "Darling, I hope you will forgive me for the unhappiness that I will cause." The note and the medical report there seem to tell the whole story. Terrible thing. I sympathize. I realize it's too late to keep the story out of the papers, but I'd appreciate it if certain details were omitted. Some things are best kept out of the papers when it's about youngsters. I knew your daughter, Mr. Kingship. She was a fine girl. - You knew her? - Not as a policeman but as a tutor. - I helped her in mathematics. - My nephew works here part time. - Did you? Have you any? - Have any idea who the man was? No. But you realize he's not legally responsible for your daughter's death? - Not legally. - We can do some checking, if you like. If you think it would accomplish anything, Mr. Kingship. Except to stimulate the kind of talk that you want to avoid. - You're right. - Well, that seems to be all. Oh. There were some valuables in her purse. Dispose of them as you see fit. But... I'd consider it a favor. Miss Kingship? If there's anything that I can do to be of assistance in any official way, call on me. - My name's Gordon Grant. - You've already been helpful. There's just no explaining why these things have to happen. - I'm very sorry. - Ellen! Miss Ellen! Mr. Corliss is calling. Thank you. Hello, Bud. I told you, you're coming here for Thanksgiving. Yes. I thought we could have dinner tonight here, too. For once, let's get to the ballet on time. All right, then. Dinner out, if you're so proud. Seven o'clock? I'll be ready. Goodbye. "Dear Ellen, this is the belt of the suit Dorothy wore last. " "We were sorority sisters. On her last day, before she went out, she borrowed one of my belts. " "It was a cheap belt, and we both knew it didn't go with her suit at all. " "Still, she wanted it, and left this one in its place. " "I hope I was right in waiting these many months before sending it. " "Sincerely, Annabelle Koch." What is that? Dorothy's belt. A girl from her sorority sent it. Very thoughtful of her. Or thoughtless. However you feel about those things. I'd have put it away and not mentioned it. I know. - What was accomplished by it? - What has to be accomplished by it? Some people do things out of sentiment. Softness, you'd probably call it. As opposed to my callousness? My hardness? I think, Ellen, you mistake parading an emotion for feeling one. I don't think I've paraded mine, any more than you've felt yours. If you've had one moment of remorse, one second when you wondered if you were responsible, you concealed it well. You have my deepest admiration, if not sympathy. That's true. I haven't dwelt on the matter to the point of distorting the facts. I haven't distorted them. Not in my own mind, at least. I said once, long ago, I couldn't believe she killed herself. I haven't changed a bit. - Ellen. - Yes, Dad? I thought tonight it might do us both good to... Well, Vincent said something about the ballet. I'm going with Bud. He's picking me up at seven. When does he study? You might have asked the same thing of me. As a matter of fact, he's a very good student. And I like him very much. That's fine, Ellen. I'm glad. - Kingship residence. - Your Lupton call. - Your call to Lupton, Miss Ellen. - Thank you, Mary. - Hello? - Miss Kingship. Nice to hear you again. You once offered a helping hand, Mr. Grant. I'm taking you at your word. You name it and I'll try and do it. And I'd rather discuss it with you in person, not over a phone. To tell you the truth, I'd prefer that myself. Tomorrow afternoon? I could leave here in the morning and be there... Wait a minute. I think we've hit a snag. I have to be in Deming tomorrow. I have to give a lecture. - How about the day after? - Meet me in the San Carlos Hotel lobby. - Say eight o'clock? - Tonight?! Yes. I'll try for the first plane out of here. I promise not to hold you up. I... I just don't want to lose two days. - Please? I'd appreciate it very much. - All right, I'll be there. Thank you. Thank you so much. Mary? Will you get my pink cotton dress for me and an overnight bag? - But I'm getting things ready for tonight. - I have to cancel that. And I want you to deliver a message to Mr. Corliss when he calls for me. There's no way I can reach him now. Tell him something important has come up about Dorothy. Some new information. And I'm having to leave for Lupton now to talk to the police. Ask him to forgive me. Tell him I'll call him when I get back. I'll tell him, Miss Ellen. Airport. Reservations desk, please. Then I remembered something that happened two days before she died. I mailed her gloves to her. She'd had them a long time and was fond of them. - But the gloves she wore when she died... - They were ruined. They were brand-new! Don't you even begin to see? I guess we'll just have to face it. You're talking to a pretty stupid man. Brand-new gloves. A borrowed belt. A blue handkerchief. An old blouse. Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue. - Where's the marriage license bureau? - In the municipal building. I think Dorothy went there to get married and not to kill herself. To go a step further, Mr. Grant, I don't think she did kill herself. - And the suicide note? - Where did it say "suicide"? "I hope you will forgive me for the unhappiness I will cause." "There is nothing else I can do." Her marriage would have made my father unhappy. But as we know now, what else could she do? If we can identify her boyfriend, I think you'll find I'm right. I've done some thinking about him, too. Dorothy wrote me when the semester began, said she met someone - in English literature, I believe - who was the real thing. - She didn't mention his name, but... - Ellen. You've really been thinking about this, haven't you? I mean, you've done a lot of thinking. Brooding, my father calls it. You can call it that, too. I'm not sensitive. I know that when tragedy hits, hits hard, that... the mind is apt to come up with a lot of far-fetched ideas. Like this. In other words, you don't believe me. - Well, I didn't say that. - What about your uncle? Would he? If you think I lack imagination, you should see him! Thanks very much anyway, Mr. Grant. Gordon. Hey, look. Let me tell you a little more about my uncle. If your sister was murdered, he wants to know about it as much as you do. And so do I. I'll admit there wasn't much of an investigation, but frankly, at that time, there wasn't a need for one. And all right, let's say there is now. - Let's say we at least check into it, OK? - Then you will help? You got yourself a date for the day after tomorrow morning. That's when I'll be back. And this student lent my sister a fairly large sum of money. The trouble is, we can't find any record that she ever repaid him. And he's evidently felt awkward about reclaiming it. I understand. What makes us feel awkward, we don't know who he is. Just that he's tall and slender and was in her English class. I thought if you'd let me look at the records... Yes, but that was two semesters ago. He may not even be here now. If I can name him, I can find him. I'll have you talk with our registrar. Harvey Levich, five-three, 164. Roy Dublin, five-eight, 151. Mr. Dublin wears glasses. A bohemian type. Sloppy clothes and such. Dwight Powell, six-one, 174. Very good-looking, dark-haired, polished. A speech major. Speech? Dorothy said he had a tape recorder. They were going to send me a birthday message and never got to it. Do you have an address? This one is scratched out. He must have moved. Yes, Watkins dorm. He moved in last semester. It might be easier to reach him at KVRI. He runs a disc-jockey show at night. - Where's that? - Municipal building. Top floor. Thank you. You've been very helpful. Dwight Powell, please. Is this Dwight Powell? I know what you did to Dory. I know all about it. Dory Kingship. You know very well who I mean. Meet me at the Esquire club, 11 o'clock. I'll tell you what I want. What are you doing down there? It's late! Don't touch me. Let me go! The police know I'm here. - What are you talking about? - Let me go! Tell me what this is about. Did you make that phone call? Take your hands off me! Look... I'm Dwight Powell. Who are you? Let's go someplace where there are people around. Anyplace. Now, look, tell me what this is all about, huh? You go first. Sure, I went with her. Look, I met her in English lit. I liked her a lot, but... when she started knitting socks for me, I figured it was time to check out. If I was a murderer, would I have let you get out of that alley? Please don't talk so loud. You went for the bait. You must have had some reason. - Well, you... - Not just to check on a crank phone call. All right. All right, listen. The fact is, I thought your sister might have... I thought she might have killed herself because I stopped going with her. I know it sounds ridiculous, conceited, anything you wanna call it. But anyhow, it's bothered me. Maybe I've been a disc jockey for too long, huh? Too many fan letters from kids. And just spinning too many records. All right, I apologize. - So what was that bit about the police? - They don't know about it. - You mean, you did this on your own? - I had to. The man I would have called just wasn't available. - That was a really crazy chance, lady. - You weren't supposed to see me. All you had to do was show up. That would tell me you felt some guilt. I'd have let the police take it from there. I'll tell you what. Next time you let the police start it, huh? You called her Dory over the phone. Is that a family name? - You never called her that? - I never heard anybody call her Dory. Somebody did. She mentioned it in her letter. I knew she took up with another guy. Who? What's his name? I don't know, just some guy she met on the campus. I never saw him. - I can find out. I've got his address. - You've got his address? After we broke off she invited me to a party at her boyfriend's house. I didn't go, but I wrote his address down in my notebook. - All right, let's get it. - Hold on. Hold it. - What are you gonna do with it? - Don't worry. I'll take it to the police first thing in the morning. Come on. Most of the fellas are at the auditorium, looking at last year's football pictures. I'll only be a minute. Put it down, Dwight. Put it down. - What are you gonna do? - Turn up the roller. - Oh, no... - Sit down, Dwight. Sit down. Please... Please. - You can have the address book. - Face the typewriter. I'll tell her I couldn't find it. I'll forget I ever saw you. Turn around. Please! - Please... - Hold steady. Please... Simple. Powell pushed the Kingship girl off the roof. Pressure got too great for him, and... Suicide note's still in the typewriter. Case opened again, closed again. But for good this time. He actually had me believing him. Dorothy believed him, too. Must run in the family. Would you like me to phone your father, tell him about this? Thanks. I'll phone him myself tonight. Anything you'd care to say about the police, you'd be right. You did it all. And the terrible thing is that, if I'd known you were doing it, I'd have stopped you. Take Miss Kingship to her hotel. Thank you. Thank you, Frank. Bill. - Ellen. - Hello, Dad. You're all right? Better. Much better. And you? If you're better, I'm fine. Oh, by the way. There's somebody waiting for you. - Bud? - In there. Bud? Hi, Ellen. - How are you? - Fine. Good. - The winner! - Well, it's a fixed race. Kingship horses do what you tell them to do. After Dad tells them it's OK. You know, I... I think he'd do it too - for you. He has changed lately. But, then, maybe I have too. - I have something to do with it? - Something? No. Everything. I had to say it, because you wanted me to. You're a diabolic spell. Not at all. Our relationship is a simple matter of chemistry. Like attracts like. Happens with minerals, happens with people. Basic formula. People who like the same things like each other. I was saying that to somebody just the other day. It really is uncanny. Same taste in books, in music... And jokes. Don't forget jokes. No good if you don't laugh at the same things. No good if you don't know what the other's thinking. I thought the chemistry took care of that? What I'm thinking about goes back before that. Something about me you don't know. A dark past? How exciting. Oh, it is. I'm a man with a shameful, sinister secret. You know what it is? - I've never really been in love before. - Bud... If this is going to embarrass you or upset you... - It doesn't. - If it does, we can pick a new formula. - I just want to tell you that I... - Can't you wait? I'm sorry. Because I can wait. I think that's what I really wanted to tell you. I'll wait. I'll wait until you fall in love with me. I'll even wait until you tell me to stop waiting, that it's useless, that it hasn't any point. I can tell you that now, Bud. There isn't any point in either of us waiting any longer. I don't want to. The formula's still working, you know. I'm in love, too, for the very first time in my life. With you. Oh. - You think... - He'll get it. Wait till you see the pool. - Where you'll announce the engagement? - Not in the pool, but around it probably. - Bud... - Mother, don't worry. They'll love you. Mother! - What is it? - That... that blouse. Why did you wear a thing like that? I told you the kind of people that would be here! - I thought you'd like it. - It's too late now. Oh, Ellen. Mrs. Corliss. How perfectly lovely you look. Why, thank you, Ellen. Thank you very much. I hope you'll find your room comfortable. We've put you near Bud. - Miss Ellen. The florist is still waiting. - OK. Go on, honey. You tend to your party. I'll take Mother upstairs. Just be sure there's enough champagne! - All the florist wanted was your OK. - Is Miss Kingship at home? - Yes, she is. - Gordon! Hello, Ellen. How are you? I... You think you have troubles! Where are the parking boys I ordered? I certainly picked a swell time to call. A hectic last minute, Gordon. But the perfect day. It's all to show off this. Gee. That's a pretty ring. Congratulations. Now I know I picked the wrong time. - Suppose I give you a call tomorrow? - Don't you dare go! No, honestly. I think my business is just a little out of tune with your festivities. If you think I'm going to spend the afternoon wondering... - Can you spare a minute? - Sure. If I can spare a minute, so can you. Well, it concerns your sister's friend - the late disc jockey, Dwight Powell. Seems that he was quite a tennis player, too. I helped my uncle wrap up that case. I made the usual enquiries to fill out the record. There's one interesting fact that just came straggling in. It seems that on the day your sister died Dwight Powell was playing tennis in a tournament in Mexico City. He'd been there almost a week. I don't believe it. Well, you'll have to. His team-mates dug up a news picture. There he was, and there was the date. If he wasn't in Lupton, he couldn't have killed her. If he didn't kill her, why kill himself? That's it. So instead of murder and a suicide, we have something else. Two murders. Do you want to go a step further? The man who killed Dorothy is still free. That's right. Well, I guess the next time I say I'd better go, you'd better let me. Actually, I gambled. I thought I saw enough happiness there to override most anything. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, the case is just starting. - I'll keep you posted. - Gordon, you're not leaving. I have to. I think my minute's just about up. Bud? I want you to meet somebody. - Miss Ellen, I hate to bother you... - Later, Bill. This is the one. Bud Corliss, Gordon Grant. - How do you do? - How are you, Bud? - Congratulations. I've heard about you. - In a certain amount of detail. - Are you from here? - No, I'm from Lupton. - Lupton? - Mm-hm. And you beat all the local guests to the party? I'd say that rates some kind of reward, Gordon. I'm not exactly that kind of guest. I'm unexpected, unprepared and just on my way out. - I really do have to go. - Gordon dropped by with a message. And to wish you both lots of happiness. Nice meeting you, Bud. - I'll be in touch, Ellen. - Mr. Kingship's office called. - Your father's on his way. - Thank heaven! Gives me a chance to get ready. Ellen? He's a nice fella. Have you known him long? I met him because of Dorothy. He knew her at the university. Oh. Well, that probably explains it. I had a feeling something upset you. On a day like this, I'm not going to be upset by anything. And I'm not going to let you be. - I really must hurry now. - Darling? You know that whatever concerns you concerns me. That works both ways. You'd better hurry too, if you're going to change. - Would you fill her up with ethyl, please? - Right. Hello, Operator? I want to put in a collect call to Chief of Police Howard Chesser in Lupton. Yeah. 25427. Right. My name is Grant. Gordon Grant. Would you check the oil? I think it's a little low. Hello, Charlie? Is Uncle Howard there? Uh, put in about a 30-weight too. And check that left rear tire. Hello, Howard? It's Gordon. Yeah. Well, I just saw her. I just met the guy she's gonna marry, too. Well, what I wanted to tell you was that I think I've seen him before. There at the university. I'll tell you the point. The point is that I think I've seen him with Dorothy Kingship. Yeah. His name is Bud Corliss. Yeah, that's right. C-O-R-L-I-S-S. Now, look, let's be sure. You call the registrar's office and check with her. And then call me back. I'll wait around for an answer. I'll be at the Chapman Hotel. You fellas in aluminum are just as badly off as we are. No more for me, thanks. I can see the look in my wife's eye. - We have to be leaving. - So soon? - Will you excuse me, Mr. Kingship? - Congratulations, Bud. Thank you, Mr. Cratchet. Mr. Fairburn. - Leo, he's a fine boy. - Thank you. There's a Mr. Grant to see you. He says it's important. - Excuse me, please. - Hope we can see you later. - How are you today? - Mr. Kingship. - When is it going to be, dear? - This coming Sunday. They just didn't want to wait. I don't know, children seem so impatient these days. - In my time... - Shall I tell them about your time? - Better yet, shall I tell them about you? - Bud, that isn't fair. Mother eloped. No waiting at all. Did he tell you he went to the state university? - That's a simple question. - Preposterous! Your implication... - He didn't tell you. - Why should he? A fella engaged to one of your daughters not mentioning that he knew the other? Knew her?! - Your uncle discovered that? - No, that part came from me. - But he's checking on it right now. - You had the gall to come here now, on an occasion like this, with no proof at all. Why? To find out whether you knew that Bud knew Dorothy. - He didn't. - How do you know? Because he would have said so. Thank you, sir. That's all I wanted to hear you say. If he did know her and didn't mention it, he must have had a reason. Unless he told Ellen and just happened to bypass you. We can check on that. - What do you mean? - Ask her! - No. - Why not? It's unthinkable, the whole thing. I know that boy. For how long? - It's degrading to ask her such a thing. - The police don't see it that way. I'm not the police. I'm her father. For that very reason, please give it more serious consideration. Mr. Grant, up until recently, Ellen and I have... Well, she's under the impression that I'm trying to run her life. I can't do it. I won't do it. Well, if you won't, then I'll have to do it for you. Gordon! You didn't have to get back after all. I'm so glad. I came looking for Dad, to tell him everyone was leaving. I see. You've told him about Powell. You should have let me do that. Ellen, did you know that Bud knew Dorothy? - Why are you asking me that? - Did you? Did Bud ever tell you? - Why are you asking? - I started it. I recognized Bud when you introduced us. You could have reminded us we went to the same university. - You didn't because you didn't know. - I didn't because it wasn't so. No. Because he didn't tell you. If he started this, how eager you must have been to join him. How you must have searched for just such a lie. You ruined Dorothy's life, and my mother's, and now you want to do the same for me. Well, it won't work. Don't ever mention this to me again. Not any part of it. Not ever. I'm sorry, Mr. Kingship. But I'll see you again, sir. Either to apologize humbly for being wrong, or else to prove that I was right. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, and thanks again. - It's been a pleasure meeting you. - Thank you. Well, that was the last. It was a wonderful party, Ellen. A real ball. The things people do when they see happiness. Did you notice that, too? They left glowing like Christmas trees. Will your father glow when he gets the bill? Think we're worth it? - A thousand times over. - Hey! Hey, I'm gonna have to give you some lessons on economy. - You want to go to dinner? - Don't even mention it. - How about a show? - I'm absolutely exhausted all at once. If you want an early start to the smelter tomorrow, cancel me out early. All right, off to bed with you, then. And pleasant dreams. Good night, darling. The Kingship mines. - Larger, you thought, or smaller? - No complaints. - This is your call, sir. - It's from the restaurant. I'd like you to take it. If you don't mind. - Kingship speaking. - This is the confirmation on it. Corliss was Dorothy's boyfriend all right. The waitress says they came here often before she died. - I see. - I'll call the Payson police right away. Yes. Thank you, Chief. - Tell Miss Ellen I want to see her at once. - She and Mr. Corliss drove to the smelter. - Thank you. - Yes, sir. There's no danger of anything happening to her up there. Why, he doesn't even know we suspect him. Ellen does. - I'll have the car brought around. - I'll tell the police where we're going. Two million dollars on wheels. It's hard to believe, isn't it? $50,000 for a truck. Of course, we get a slight discount, buying them by the gross. Looks like the center of creation! They'll be in China for Easter Sunday! - They've worked this pit for eight years. - Seven. Darling! You sound like you knew the Kingship mine before the Kingship girl. No, it's not that. It's just that mining has always interested me. Ever since I can remember. Like you said, two of a kind. Copper, music... You should have heard Dorothy on the subject of Debussy and me. I used to drag that girl to every concert. I try to see most of them, too. Shall we go up? - How were the concerts in Lupton? - Not bad, for a town that... That was some time ago. They're probably even better today. - Look at that! - I've seen it. I think we better be getting back now. But I can't go on like this. I've got to know. - You mean about Lupton? - Yes. Did I go to the university? Did I know your sister? Yes, I did, Ellen. I even had a few dates with her. Bud, why didn't you tell me?! All right, I will. When I transferred up here and happened to meet you, I saw right away what you were going through. My telling you, would that have helped you forget? - But later... - Later. Later we fell in love, and I knew I mustn't tell you. I'd be chaining you to a reminder of grief every time you looked at me. I'd be putting a curse on both of us. - I suppose I... - I still don't understand. - If it was only innocent, you... - What did you say? If it was innocent? If it was? - I didn't mean that... - Is that what your love is like? Is that a sample of your faith in me? Your trust? Oh, Bud! Who put you up to this? Grant? He probably saw me with her once. What an operator. He drives all the way up here to tell you that. It was to tell me about Powell. - The fella who killed your sister? - Except that he didn't. He didn't kill himself. He was killed by the same man who killed Dorothy. How do they know? They're bluffing. He left a note. It said it all there. They didn't find anybody. How do they even know your sister was killed? They're guessing, Ellen. Powell was about to give me the murderer's address. The murderer knew that. He overheard us. He just happened to be there? He didn't just happen to be there, Bud. He'd followed me. He followed every move I made. Ellen, that's even crazier! How could he? Known I was in Lupton? I sent him a message, telling him so. Remember? You think you know. I'm telling you you're wrong. All these things are coincidence. Me knowing her, the university... So did a hundred other guys. You are tall and slender. That was in her letter. What letter? - You were right beside me all along. - It means nothing. - Dory knew it doesn't... - "Dory"... There weren't a dozen called her Dory. There was only one. Why did you have to do this, Ellen? To me? To yourself? Most of these things you've said, the police don't even know. They do. Yes, they do. No. No, they don't. Or I wouldn't be here, would I? And you wouldn't be here with me. I put my whole life into this, Ellen. Everything I ever wanted, right here. I can't give it up. You're insane. Can't you see that? You can't go any further. Your father and I... we'll grieve together. We'll have that to share between us two. There.
