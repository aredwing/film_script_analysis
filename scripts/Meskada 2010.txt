No one saw anything at all. Can you believe this? What do you think happened... our guy chase the boy in here? I think he was already in here. I think the boy came in, surprised him, went for the phone. Then he hit him once in the back of the head. Are you done with the kid? The mother's a widow, you know, a local bigwig at County. - A deputy? - No, the County Board - of Commissioners. - Right. Did you say the phone line was cut? Yeah. So our guy not only misreads the house as empty, but he cracks a kid's skull for going for a phone that he knows is cut. A different he maybe. Listen, I talked to the assistant DA in the sheriff's office. They're gonna assign another detective to work with you, assist you. This is our town, Terry. It's our jurisdiction. They know. This is your case, don't worry. Who is it? They don't have a name for me yet. You'll meet him down at the morgue. Detective. It's a tent stake. We're gonna need to rope this off over here. Crime scene. Crime scene 1. I need a unit on Route 22, mile marker 46, about 20 yards south. Copy that, Detective. Detective, Leslie Spencer from county. They told you I was coming. They said someone was, yeah. Allison Connor just made the ID. Do you want me at the crime scene? You can come back with me at dawn. Sure. She's with the county prosecutor. She's a widow, you know. Yeah, I know. I had a sponsorship dinner in Bloom Hills. Um, Angela was sleeping over at a friend's house. She got picked up at 6:45. Toby was downstairs in the basement playing video games. I went downstairs and asked him if he wanted me to call Maris. She watches him sometimes when I'm going to be out late. And he said that I should just go. So he'd been home all day then? Yes, he got sick at school. He came home in the middle of the day. What about getting the mail? Did he leave the house again? I doubt it. Why does that matter? We don't know if this man has been watching the house or for how long. He may have thought the house was empty. It's felony murder regardless, Detective. And my office intends to prosecute it as such. You said he was just... just one person? One, possibly two. We don't know yet. We think Toby came up and just stumbled upon him from the basement. He was hit once in the back of the head. Excuse me for a bit. No, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm sorry. Mrs. Connor, we can do this again at another time. No. No no no no, l... I would like to do it now. I need you to start this now. This was a burglary, so we're gonna need a list of anything missing. We're gonna have to get that out as soon as possible, because sometimes things turn up. Okay, I'll do that tomorrow. And we're gonna need to speak with your friends, your associates in local government. Maybe there was a dispute. You have kids? No, I don't. Detective. Maybe his lookout? Not his... theirs. They're all Camel Lights. Radio the unit. Crime scene 1, we need a unit out to the north quarter here along the rock walk. Hey, Noah. Yeah? You should get over here, behind the house about 60 yards back. What's up? Is this a good lead? We'll see if we find the other one. Anything today? It's just terrible. We saw it on the news. Zack saw? Yeah, he walked in when I was watching. Did he say anything? Huh-uh. Sorry to bring you guys out so early. This is a tent stake. We found it at a critical spot near the crime scene. If these guys were camping, I'm guessing they were on the road already before they got here. There's campgrounds and we have three highway junctions within a few miles. So let's cover everything, including garbage cans. Out of all the houses... We should head home. The job wasn't supposed to end until the 24th. It's all right. We've been on the road for weeks. No one's gonna remember the exact date. I'm sure your sister does. Maybe we should just... just keep driving. What do you mean? Look, if they had an eyewitness, there'd be sketches on TV. It's all over the news. We're gonna be safer at home, I think. I'm just gonna call Lyla tomorrow morning, make sure nothing weird's going on. You mean, tell her? Christ. No, Eddie. I'll find out subtly. Right, yeah yeah. I mean, we need to get off this road. Time to sleep in a bed already. Yeah. It was an accident. Bad luck. # Yesterday's gone # # Roll on tomorrow # # 15 state lines # # Can't leave behind my sorrow... # Hey, been a while. Hey. Boys, how was the road trip? - Great. - Yeah? Make some money? Did okay. Want a beer? Please. Oh, hey, Nat, is there no bouncer at the door tonight? Who let these guys in? How long have I known you? A long time. But how long? Many years, man. I've known your sorry ass so long, I don't remember not knowing you. You know that? Last call. Hey. Hey yourself. You miss us? No. Not really. - You've got something on your face. - Shut up. Come here, let me get it. Asshole. # It's over my head # # Over my head # # Up in the deep blue sky # # Deep in your eye # # All my life # # All of this time # # I finally found out # # It's over my head. # Do you ever think about what's after... life? No. Not really. Never? No. You lie. I'm not lying. I never have. Why do you ask me that? Maybe it's like how you feel when you're dreaming. I guess so. But I always have, like, reoccurring zombie dreams, so... You would dream something like that. Whatever. My favorite dreams are the ones with my friends in them, you know? You dream about your friends? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Hey there. Sorry. I wanted my Truckmaster. How are you doing, big guy? How is the old... how's the leaky pipe? Been hurting? Mom thinks you're away, putting trees on trucks. Yeah. Yeah, we're done with that now. Hey, can you take me down to the lake? That's where Dad is. Yeah, sure. Mom, Uncle Shane's home! Hey there. Hey. I thought you said the 24th. Yeah. We finished early. Everything go okay? Yeah, it was fine. Just got the date wrong. I got some money for you guys. Thank God. Keith's infection now needs two medicines for some reason the doctor can't explain. Plus, my goddamn car battery died again. Is Dennis working? He had a construction gig up in Hilliard but finished a week ago. I'm sure he'll be hired at the new Kinnealey-Masterson facility. We just gotta hang on a while longer. Yeah. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Okay, come right here. Ready? Go! Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going. Dad, Dad. Whoa. Go long. Didn't expect to see you around. Yeah, the job finished early. - Yeah? How did it go? - Yeah. It went, Dennis. How much you make? Maybe $600. That's it? For five weeks? So what are you gonna do now? I'm not sure. Yeah, I ain't worried about it though. I'm sure you're eager to get out of our den. that's no way to live, right? Right. See ya. Keith. - Who called you? - Someone from the rangers' office. Since when did campgrounds start separating recyclables? Come on, everybody's going green. I'll get the gloves. You do the tarp. Okay, this is great. Glamorous though, no? Yeah. It's the good stuff here. - All right. - Here we go. You don't say much personal type stuff. Okay. I was raised in Sacramento. I started in the uniform up there. Then I moved to Montana State Patrol for a guy... the wrong guy, of course. So one day I just got so fed up, I sent out I think about 50 resumes, covered the entire country. And Meskada County was first to respond. Hey. "MM4620S R22." Mile marker 46, Anything else? Yes, a flyer. This is a local fair. Where? A town called Caswell. How do you know? It's where I'm from. Well, we should call the DA, maybe Caswell police. We don't need to call anyone yet. I mean, it's late already. We'll drive out tomorrow. Okay. It's your case. God, I haven't been back there since my dad's funeral. Senior year in high school my folks saved up all this money for me to go to MacAuley College. I didn't want to go. I loved it in Caswell. But Dad insisted. We fought day and night for months. I ended up going. I met Emily and that was it. Never moved back. Love will do that to you. Yeah, I guess so. Daniel. Hey. Oh my God, it's been a while. Yeah, it's been too long. How are you? - Really good. - Oh. Oh! As I live and breathe. - What are you doing? - How's things, Billy? No complaints. How about you? Really good. Just give me one second. Can I get you a beer or something? No, thanks. What brings you down here? Take care of him. How's Jane? - Ah. Busy as hell. - Yeah? Yeah, finally sold the Wyatt plant... a pharmaceutical company called Kinnealey-Masterson. - Been working on it for months. - That's great news. Yeah. Well, it's something like 400 jobs, so, you know, it's really gonna save us. The only problem is I never get to see her before midnight. Hey, you know what? You should come down to the floats this year. I know she'd love to see you. Hey, Missy, if you find this punk on the wall over there, lunch is on the house. Step into my office here, fellas. - Sure you don't want a beer? - No. You've got a little official business going on? Family all right? Everybody good? Yeah yeah yeah. You guys hear about this burglary up by me? Mm. Yeah. The one where that kid got killed? Yeah. That is a fucking nightmare. Is it your case? Are guys trucking up to Hilliard from here for work? Of course. Seems like kind of a long way, no? Gotta go where the work is, right, Noah? I mean, Wyatt's been closed down for almost, I don't know, five years or so. Yeah, I mean, guys do construction trade all over, you know... Hilliard, Northfield, Ocinto. Hand me the rag, will you? Say please. So wait a minute. What... what... what are you thinking, Noah? You think that mess might lead here? No, I haven't called anyone yet. I'm here on my own. Noah, who's the looker? She's with me. I'm keeping this quiet, but I do need to do some interviews with guys who have been traveling for work. Noah, everyone here travels for work. People are constantly coming and going all the time. The town's like a regular truck stop. Well, Hilliard workers then. You have some evidence, I'm guessing? I have what I have, Daniel. Guys, this is me, you know. It's gonna stay under control. I just need you to help me round up some people, that's all. Yeah, all right, Noah. We'll play ball. # Ride on my tumbleweed # # It's the only way to get around... # Thanks for your time, Carl. Yeah. A kid got iced in Hilliard. Hilliard? What the fuck are they doing way down here? They're cops. They got nothing better to do than waste our time. Keith's sick today. I can't fucking do this right now. Cross your fingers for door number two though. She's a fox. - Later. - Mm-hmm. Have a seat. Okay. Name, please. Dennis Burrows. I'm Detective Cordin from the Hilliard Township Police. I guess you know why I'm here. Some kid was killed? That's right. A boy was murdered the night of October 6th... it was a Monday night... during a robbery of his home. You don't have any suspects in your own town? I'm talking to guys who work construction up there, trying to account for their whereabouts that night, if possible. Whereabouts? Yeah. Hmm, I can't really remember. I was probably hanging out with some of the guys on the crew. I was staying at Motel 6 on Route 80. Anything more specific? Can anyone vouch for that? Not off the top of my head, no. You know, sometimes people's memories are pretty good when they exercise them. Yeah well, I'm on the road a lot. It's hard to exercise when you work for a living. You got me? I think so. Excuse me one second. Oh, you can have a seat. I'll be right back. - I'm not done yet? - Not yet. But my kid's sick. I gotta get home. He's by himself. It shouldn't be much longer. Mr. Burrows, this is Detective Spencer from the Meskada County Sheriff's Office. I hate to bring this up, but you were arrested in 1998 for grand larceny in Hatherton. Yeah, and that case was thrown out 'cause it was fucking stupid. Yeah, I got sold a hot car. So what? I have an alibi. You're a fucking cop. Why don't you look at the court record? - I will. - Good. County Sheriff, huh? Could you get me a glass of water? Mr. Burrows, one more time, can you remember where you were the night of October 6th? No. So my report is gonna be about Bart Simpson. Sweetie, you can't do it on a TV character. Mrs. Danson said it's okay. Come on, buddy. Your mom worked all day and made this nice food. Stop playing with it. Ow. - You got a pain? - Yeah. Hey. Jesus. Where were you? A lady's paying to clear out a house on the 527. You went with Eddie? No, I couldn't find him. I hitched. - You playing cards tonight? - Yeah. Do your homework first. How much does it pay? How long is the job for? L... I don't know, Dennis. Chris said you never made it to the lake yesterday. Yeah, got held up by the goddamn cops. Cops? Yeah, there were cops from Hilliard here. From Hilliard? A bunch of crap really. They just wanted to speak to everybody that's working up there. A boy got killed during a house robbery. It's terrible. Yeah, it was, but it's not like they had any proof. It was a cattle call really. - Mom, can I have some juice? - Yeah, go ahead. What'd they ask? Nothing. Wanted people's alibis. If they had nothing, then why'd them come down here? It doesn't figure. A waste of time maybe. It's a juvenile homicide. They don't have time to waste. Do I look like a fucking cop to you? Whoa whoa whoa, buddy, buddy. - Are you all right? - Yeah. What, did you lose your balance? - Yeah. - Come on, sweetie. He needs a new prescription. What he needs is the damn surgery, Dennis. Good morning. - What's up? - Hey, babe. Hey, let's go. I got us some work. We're cleaning. This is paid work. So's this. I'm earning room and board. You want to maybe help us out? - Yeah. - Attaboy. You guys see all that commotion at the municipal the other day? I heard about it. - Crazy shit. - Yeah. - You were there? - Me? - Yeah. - Nah. They only wanted guys working in Hilliard. The cops were there all day. It was weird. If you ask me, it's just harassment. What's that, genius? I'm just saying obviously they have no real evidence or suspects. How would you know what they have? Well, I know they talked to about 80 guys and asked them all the same lame-ass questions. Yeah, it seemed like BS. They're just bothering us white trash, hoping for a fucking miracle. Cops don't believe in miracles, Eddie. Hey, babe, the bucket's getting pretty full. You mind dumping it? I'll go. Thank you. Tell me she knows nothing. I'm not a moron. Did you give her anything from the house? Shane, relax, all right? We should leave town. Why? It's just a little storm. It'll pass. Says who? It would only be temporary. And you think that wouldn't look suspicious? We just got back. We're broke. We can't lie about another job. I know that you and Nat are getting into some kind of a relationship... Hey hey hey. Hey, leave her out of this, all right? I'm trying to. I don't know why they were here. I told you. Eddie, no. Look, hey, they're not gonna come to our town and interrogate a bunch of people besides us. We shouldn't do anything right now. Fuck, it's like if there's a snake by your foot, are you gonna move? Did you get anything on that list of stolen stuff? I called every pawnshop. What about your interviews from Caswell? There are two that set off my radar. You recognize either name? Huh-uh. What about yours? I'm waiting on a couple alibis, but I'm still feeling this guy that I brought you in on... Burrows. Him? Maybe. We're out of moves. It's time to get creative. What about this... the floats thing? Are we going to that? Not us... you. Me? What, alone? No no, you should bring your family. Why? 'Cause you're all invited. It's a nice family moment. You can show them where you grew up. I mean, really why? Oh well, it gets you back there in a way that's indirect. I think that's how we're gonna do this one. Yeah. It's a good move. Would it be weird for you to go back like this? Not really. Good. Bring your family. Leave the shield. Hey, Dad. It's pretty late, Zack. I'm just watching TV. Sorry I didn't get to come to your game, but you know what's going on. Are we going to the fair where you grew up? I'm gonna go, but you and Mom are gonna stay home. Why? 'Cause Mom has work to do and she thought it would be better if I went by myself. Make sure the safety's on. It's not loaded. Just do it. All right, that's enough. I'm going to bed. So, uh, it feel strange being back? Nah, not really. You know, honestly I still cannot believe that you're a cop, and much less in Hilliard, for Chrissakes. It's like... Shut the fuck up. Billy hasn't changed, huh? Thank God, right? Just like his joint. I swear to God, the place looks the exact same as when we were in high school. It probably always will be. I'm so sorry it took that mess up in Hilliard to get you down here. So are you done with your questioning? Yeah. Guys. Stop. Want to see the animals? I love it. They're so fluffy. They're cute. That fucking cop. Who? The one from Hilliard, drinking there with Daniel. He's back? He's from here supposedly. That's what Freddy told me. He's fucking eyeballing me all day. Stop staring at him, Dennis. Why is he zoned on you? I don't know. Have you told him where you were that night? Yeah, of course. He doesn't believe you? Don't know. Were you hiding something? What are you getting at? It's that same chick from the motel, wasn't it? That was a one-night stand. - Yeah, it wasn't.. - Yeah, it was. I'm out there working. I hear things. You hear shit. You're making an ass out of my sister and people are starting to know. I want you out of my house. I'll leave when I'm ready. It's been a fucking year. When I get the money together, Dennis. Mom! Mom! - Guys. - Stop it. Dennis, knock it off. Dennis, Dennis. - Stop it! - Get out of here. Enough, man. Hey, stranger, what are you doing? You did a great job this year, Jane. Tim's band's okay. We're happy you made it down. Daniel misses seeing you around. Yeah. So your family couldn't come this year? Em had to work. Maybe next year? Go make your wish. Welcome back. Thanks. Shane Loakin. Yeah? Noah Cordin. You know who I am? Uh, I can't say I do. I'm a detective from Hilliard. You got car trouble? No, just... sobering up a little bit for the drive home. Home... back to Hilliard? Yeah well, I grew up here, so it's all relative. Home's wherever you hang your head... uh, your hat, I mean. Wherever... wherever you find a place to sleep, right? Here or there, your own or someone else's. I suppose so. A couple of nomads. Yeah. Drive safe, Detective. Hey, you mind some company? Lt'll speed up the sobering process. Sure. Travel for work? Sometimes. What about your brother-in-law? You ever travel with him or work together? No. No. That's right. You don't, even though you live in his den, right? Yeah, I know you don't, so relax. What's your thing say? Eh. What's that? "Knights of Albion." What the hell is that? Just some nonsense me and my friend made up a while ago. I gotta get home. I got work early tomorrow. Hold on one sec. Your brother-in-law and some guys around here have lied to me. I think you know why and I think you feel bad. I know you've got something for me. Detective, you're wrong. Whether it was an accident, you know, or whatever happened, right now the doors are still open, but every day that goes by this thing gets a little worse. You're wrong, Detective. I don't have anything. I'm sorry. "I want you to know, Mrs. Connor," how sorry I am about this. I never wanted to hurt anyone. I thought the house was empty. When your son ran for the door, I panicked. I know this doesn't make it easier for you, but at least you know I'm also hounded by this. And even here, back at home, I know there's no forgiveness. I just wanted to write you the best apology I can. "God bless you always." The postmark's from Clint Hills, so we need to contact the Ohio State Police. Let's do that right away, please. Allison, I'm sorry, this confession... it isn't real. How do you know that? The newspaper reported that Toby was killed trying to escape the house. It was a mistake. He wasn't killed running for the door. He was killed running for the phone. Whoever wrote this wasn't in your house that night. A false confession is used to throw suspicion onto someone else. But there's nothing relevant here. It's just an apology. The point's not the apology. What is it then? It's where it was mailed from. You're trying to tell me that someone wrote this false confession to this murder and then they drive across state lines just to mail it to Allison? We found something at the Wolf Creek campgrounds which indicates the killer is from Caswell. What, are you close to an arrest? No, but... Caswell. I feel like I've... I've heard about them recently. They're applying for the Kinnealey-Masterson plant. Right. Right. Allison, I have relationships there. It's my home town. It's a good thing for us. This is a good thing. That's why people are sending false confessions from foreign lands. The Meskada County Commissioner's meeting is hereby called to order. First item... exploratory questions regarding Kinnealey-Masterson's proposed facility in Caswell. Phyllis, thanks. I'd ask anyone in attendance to bear with us. This was a late addition to today's agenda. Well, first things first... I certainly appreciate Caswell town administrator Jane Hartfield and Mrs. Burrows... and not sure who you are, sir, but thank you for coming. Commissioner, this is Ronald Harlan. He's been handling the survey for Kinnealey's engineers... Landsman Associates. We're happy to be here, although I must say it took us by surprise. I know. I'm sorry. This matter usually gets brought to the planning commission, no? I understand. But as you might know, when the environmental impact statement in tandem with the county budget and the utility projections reaches a certain dollar estimate, budget vetting can come to this commission if we deem it appropriate. as well as electricity estimates... Commissioner, those water estimates encompass construction... first year only. Well, in your March proposal... Moreover, the planning commission already told us that our numbers... Mrs. Hartfield, this has nothing to do with the planning commission. We're all residents of Meskada County, we all understand the value of economic growth and I would love to support a new business proposal that provides jobs for one of our needier communities. All we're saying is this setup may not be cost-feasible to us. And if Caswell can absorb the environmental remediation, civil construction... Commissioner, Caswell cannot pay those costs upfront. The strategy I've developed with the EDC is that our county invests in us now and our subsequent economic growth would benefit everyone. There's a lot of pride in Caswell, sir... Mrs. Hartfield, we don't doubt your sincerity or your work ethic. Mr. Harlan, I think there were earlier talks with Kinnealey-Masterson regarding other possible sites. I see... Kinnealey-Masterson chose Caswell, sir, not only because we have a viable facility, but because our productivity numbers with Wyatt were outstanding. I've been working with them for months. They like our facility. They're excited about our work experience. Now what exactly is happening here, sir? Mrs. Hartfield, I do not appreciate your tone. Well, I don't like this charade we're all playing when our home is at stake. Charade? This is our chance to rebuild, sir. We have been dying a slow death for almost six years now. If this sale doesn't happen, that's it for us. - This is a... excuse me. - It took us five years... Excuse me. ...to find this buyer. Who knows when we will find another? This is a government meeting. It is not a charade. You call it that one more time, I'll nod to our secretary and then what it will be is over. Commissioner, if you speak to my wife like that again, I'm gonna drag you over that desk and break your jaw. I want to be clear... we're not calling a vote tonight. This meeting is to raise some issues in an open forum, which we've done. We're not ready to decide this matter. But when it's made, if Caswell is unhappy with the results, then they can certainly file a petition with the county prosecutor's office. Maybe a hearing will be granted. Where is that office, sir? We want to be prepared for that. This building, Mrs. Burrows. Hey, big man. How are you doing? Mom's crying. Yeah, I know. She's gonna be okay. Is she crying because of me? No, she's not. I wish my ear didn't hurt all the time. I know, big guy. I'll tell you a little secret, just between me and you. It's not gonna hurt much longer. Okay? Everybody, please sign with your address. We need proof of residency from everyone, okay? And listen up. Listen up. If your family's not all here, take a sheet home with you. All right? You can collect the signatures yourselves. Hey, Daniel, even if we got it here, what the hell what it do? I told you, Carl, we're not there yet. It's just one avenue. Jane met with the lawyer today and he suggested this as a backup. What do you want me to do? Someone needs to tell this goddamn detective - that we've had enough. - Yeah. Forget the detective. This thing's way bigger than him by now anyway. I'm saying he obviously told someone. Carl, I know what you're saying, but we're never gonna see that prick again. Well, you know what? Maybe you should call him, Daniel. Hey, Carl, this isn't Noah's show anymore. I've told you that. He's not coming back. That's it. You gotta trust me on this, please. Well, can we apply directly for state funding and bypass the goddamn commission? Jane has to speak to the lawyer again, all right? I'm sure there's funding at that level but... - I don't want to hear it. - I know you don't care. Returning the phone calls. Do you understand? - Yeah, I get it. - Good. - I can't deal with this. - Hold on, everybody just quiet down for one second, please. Can I have your attention, please? I'm gonna say this once and only once. If anybody has any information on that homicide or if anyone lied to the cops for any reason at all, please be a man about it and call them now. Doesn't matter why or who. We're not judging here. Just fix it. - You owe it to your families. - Yeah. You owe it to your friends and to everybody in this town. Lieutenant, the Hilliard City Council, along with these residents of friends of Allison, have collected $125,000 that we propose you post to the media and in Caswell as a reward for any information in this case. Sir, while I'm sure Allison appreciates your compassion, I have to agree with my detectives... it just isn't a good idea. Well, unfortunately, we're losing confidence in your ability to decide what is a good idea. First... first... first we're told that the investigation leads back to the detective's home town and that you have some possible suspects and that you are going to get someone to talk. - We might have actually done that. - Hold on. It's our turn now. And now we're told that you've cleared all of Caswell's suspects, they've all given alibis, and that you're back to square one. How does that happen? What's going on here, Detective? The reward will only inflame the tension... Whoever killed my son was looking for money. Why wouldn't it help? If money is the thing, save the reward and stop messing with Caswell's future. Officers, the reward has been collected. You will post it with the media and you will tack up those posters in Caswell. Do it, Noah, or I will find state detectives to take this over. I do not care what's right anymore. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I want the man who killed my son. I want the man who killed my son! - Caswell's future? Are you insane? - Allison, Allison. - I will burn that town to the ground! - Allison. - Allison. Shh. - To the fucking ground! Why did you say that? What? Today, about Caswell's future. Because it needed to be said. This woman lost her son, Noah. Can you even imagine what... I know she lost her son. I've been spending every day living with this. Well, all I'm saying, Noah, is that I didn't like hearing it. I didn't ask you to come. Didn't I say to skip it? I didn't want you there. This is my town too. What do you expect me to do, just... Shh, hold on. What? Stay here. Noah, are you sure? I didn't hear anything. Hello. Hello, I'm trying to reach Detective Cordin. Yeah, this is he. Detective, this is Sergeant James Pactor at Meerfield Police Department. - Meerfield? - That's right. This is your name on a fax we got a while back... missing property from a burglary in Hilliard? Yeah yeah, that's right. Well, you're not gonna believe this, but one of the items showed up at a pawnshop over here last week. I think there's a kid you need to pick up. His name is Chris Ainslie. Oh Jesus. That's him... jean jacket. Damn it. Hey, guys. Stop! Police! Chris Ainslie, arms up! What's this about? Do not move. You are wanted for questioning by the Hilliard police. - Look, I can explain. - Keep your arms up! Get on your knees slowly. Put your hands on your head. I get it. This is a gun. I'll throw it on the ground and we can talk it out. - No, do not... Chris! - I'll throw it on the ground, I will! - Where'd the gun go? - I don't see it. Look. I met her over at Billy's Tavern in Caswell. She's good people. So she came to you and just said, "I need you to fence this stuff - just for money"? - Right. That was it. And she's been doing this a while? She comes to you for this stuff? Whenever she needs it done, I do it for her. She gave me a bag of stuff. I give it to my guy and he moves it for me. Billy! - Come outside. - No. Shit. God damn it, Cordin. What do you want now? - I need to talk to your niece. - For what? Why? - Why? Because we do. - What kind of answer is that? Who do you think you're talking to? Let's take it outside. - Billy, no. - What do you mean, no? I'm trying to run a business here, Noah. Let's take it outside. Now, Billy, don't make this worse. Worse? Are you shitting me? You ruined our deal, Noah. You fucked this entire town. There is no worse. Look around you. So what? So someone cries in Hilliard and it rains down shit here forever? Is that right? You're gonna get your deal back. You just gotta let me do some things. Forget it. Is she under arrest? One way or another, I have to talk to her. - Fine. Go ahead, talk. - She has to come with us. The fuck she does. I already told you, I got about 20 witnesses that put her here in the bar the night of your fucking burglary. Well, there's no need to worry then, right? This is nuts. I don't know anything about it. See? You heard her. Billy, let me do my job. - Your job? - Yeah, let me do my job. You call this a job? Are you... hold on, Noah. Hold on, I asked you already... - Noah. - Let him come through. Guys. Hey, Noah. I want to talk to Noah! - Give her some room. - I'm asking you, Noah. - I swear to God, Noah. - Get back. Back up. - Come on. - Get off me. I swear to God, I don't know how you live. - Leave her alone. - Back up. Work it out. Work it out. It's all right, Nat. Hey, Noah. Noah! Go fuck yourself, Detective! We're gonna have your badge, you know. Well, you'd better take a number. What's in the bag? You know a Chris Ainslie in Meerfield? Yeah. Why? He claims you gave him some stuff to pawn for you. So what? It's my stuff. He usually gets me a better price. Yeah, I know. Like this, right? This is yours? This is yours? - So what? - And these? I'm sorry, is there a point here? And this is yours? That has a serial number on it. It's stolen property. And we know you weren't at the Connor home on October 6th, which means someone gave it to you. Do you want to get your deal back or do you want to let it die? If it does, it's not on my head. Oh yes, it is. I'll make sure it is. I'll make sure everybody knows you could have put an end to this and chose not to. Look, I got that at a garage sale. I found it in a pile of junk. I see. You found it. Yeah, I found it. What the fuck are you... - get the fuck off me! - Get up. - Eddie, Eddie. - Yeah? What's with you? What did you say to Nat? Nothing. Well, they have her. The cops... they took her from Billy's. - Wait. What? - I'm serious, man. There's no time. You have to tell me what you said so we can get out of this. I told her nothing, okay? Nothing. We gotta get out of here. Where's your car? She doesn't know anything, so she can't say anything. Where's the car? Where's the car? I'm not leaving her. Where's the car? I'm not fucking leaving her. It's a felony murder. That means the needle... the needle! And not just for you because you were the one who did it. I know how you feel about Nat and everything, but whatever you're feeling, trust me, the needle is worse. A girl gave that to me, okay? I don't know why I tried to protect her. Who? A girl in Meerfield. I see her at the warehouse where I buy plastic goods for the restaurant. - Name? - Megan. - Megan what? - She never told me. - Stop lying. - I'm not lying. She was always hitting on me. She put this thing on my wrist and said it looked good, I could have it. - Did you know she was a thief? - No, she seemed cool. 'Cause a boy is dead, Nat. A kid was killed so you could pawn that fucking bracelet. Yeah, I get it. What did Megan say? Nothing really. She give you anything else? No, not gifts. What then? She wanted to hang out. - She hit on you all the time, right? - Yes! So what did she say?! She worked at a Denny's in Frankville. And she played guitar in a band. What else? I don't know. I barely spoke to her. Bitch, are you deaf? I didn't want to know what you said. What did Megan say? She was saving up some money to buy a van so that they could play in some clubs. - And what, she wanted you to come? - That's what she said. - She liked you. - Who knows? She got... she got you shit. She wanted you to know her plans. She liked you a lot. I guess so. What were they called? What was what called? The name of the band. What was it called? I don't remember. I don't remember. Christ, it was the first fucking thing she told you! Jesus. The Knights of Albion! Jesus. The Knights of Albion? The Knights of Albion? That was the name? Un-fucking-believable. We'll find him. Police. Open up. Open the door. It's the police. We know someone's in there. Open the door! You in the front room, come out with your hands up! Come out with your hands up! What the fuck? I don't know. What should we do? Make a right down here. I know a shortcut. There was no way you could have known. This isn't over. We'll find him. Detective, we got a message from Lieutenant Lindy of Hilliard police. You have to go back right away. Now? He said it was urgent. Okay. What's up, guys? Where are you going? You taking a trip? Eddie, you dragged my niece into this. I know you did. Billy, I swear I didn't. Bullshit. Bullshit. Come on. The two of you... you killed the kid in Hilliard and you brought his death back here on us. Didn't you? Isn't that how it happened? Tell 'em we confessed. Just give us a head start. No no no, you tell 'em. You tell 'em your story and take your own chances. We're going to the Hilliard police right now. Which one of you killed this kid? There's something in that duffel... something that's mine I kept from that night. Give it to the cops. It's like a confession. It's a little late for a fucking confession, don't you think? How fucking stupid are you, huh? Don't you know these people are rich? There's money in that bag for your son's surgery. Why don't you just take the bag, Dennis? - Fuck your money. - Hey, easy. Let's just face it, Dennis... if you were a better man, we probably wouldn't be here right now, would we? - Guys, Dennis, enough. Stop. - Knock it off. You stay here. That's enough. Back him up. Back him up. Stop. What are you doing? Jesus. Christ Almighty, Dennis. What is that? I'll tell his family. Noah, the sheriff's gonna take it from here. What do you mean? This doesn't reflect on you, Detective. What? No no. Sheriff, this is my case. There were two people who broke into the Connor house. We know that. Now I'm telling you... - Noah, Noah, it's... - This kid is not the killer. It's over. - I'm telling you he's not... - Come on, walk with me. - Listen up, guys. Listen up. - You know it. I want the body removed to the morgue now. I want the body out of here. - Stop. Stop, all right? - Noah. - Get your hands off me. - Hey hey hey, let him go. - Get off me! - Let him go. Let him go. He'll be all right. Drive away. Drive past the county line, past the state line, to the end of the earth. And don't you ever try to contact Nat. Don't you ever come back to Caswell. Do you understand me? - Go go. - No no, get the duffel. Get the money. Get it. Get out of here, Eddie. Where's the fucking duffel... - Get out of here. Go. - Go. In local news, pharmaceutical conglomerate Kinnealey-Masterson has announced its plan to purchase the former Wyatt Industries plant in Caswell. Reporting live from the Meskada County courthouse is Rachel Grimley. Rachel. In a joint press conference with the Meskada Economic Development Council, Masterson executives announced it will commence conversion of the former plastics facility in September, bringing approximately 500 jobs to Caswell by next summer. Leslie, it's Noah. It's late. I need you for something. All's well that ends well, right? There's just one problem. Where is the other one? Someone was with Shane Loakin that night. You wanted my job. You just did it half-assed. You didn't finish, guys. So where's the other one? No, wait! Noah, no! Done with us, Detective? Take a look around. Are you finished here? Sweetie, go pack up your toys, please. Okay? Thank you. The boy they found at the courthouse... did he kill Toby? The sheriff's office is taking over your case. Yeah, I know that. They told me it was him. I just... I want to know what you think. Are you sure? I know you said that you thought that maybe there were two guys. I'm sure, Allison. It was him. We're not leaving Hilliard. It's just, you know... a house across town. Go home, Noah. Go to your family. Thank you. Thank you.
