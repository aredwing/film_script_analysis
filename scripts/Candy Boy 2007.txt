Children, this is Samy. I expect you to give him a warm welcome. Welcome, Samy. Here. Here. 9 x 9 = 81. 9 x 10 = 90 9 x 11 = 99. It's easy. Now let's work on addition. Madeleine has 57 candles and 25 crucifixes. She decides to sell them in God's name to help the needy. 57 + 25... Who knows the answer? I'm listening. He started to get anxious. He wanted to force the kids to eat, so I get up and say, "This is inhumane, sir! You can't do that." He loses it, he swears he'll make me eat! He nearly stabs me with my fork, but I fight back! Then the Rector comes in... And that's when the fork went flying! Eat. I'm not hungry. Do like me, ignore him. I'm glad they kicked me out! The new boy hasn't run yet. 1, 2, 3... Go! He won, he won! Bedtime. Goodnight. Goodnight. Candy Boy? I'm sick. Stop cheating. - You're a dirty cheater. - You all are. Candy Boy! You should tell the new boy not to leave the dormitory at night. Here, take a puff, man. Chill out. Get to bed! You're no fun. Go on, I won't tell anyone. Candy Boy, Candy Boy... I don't think they're faking it. Look what I found in the toilets! I see. I'll trust my instincts on this. Samy! I swear I didn't say anything! Open your eyes, you might learn something. I'll do my best to get you out. Open the door, Candy Boy! You asshole! I'll get you! Open this fucking door! I'll get you, asshole. Why did you snitch on Samy? You're a real bastard. Open your eyes, you might learn something. Mr MacManus pays for your uniform. Thanks to Mr MacManus, you have fish on Fridays. So, Candy Boy, I don't understand why a model pupil like you would make such sordid accusations? Could this be Samy's influence? Did he put these ideas in your head? For your own good, you're grounded until further notice. Yes, Mother. The bastards. Want one? You shouldn't be here, Candy Boy. You're a good pupil. They're dumping toxic waste in the river near your orphanage. That's why everyone's sick. Run! Shit! Get off me! You have no place with us. It's great you're back! We were unfair, Candy Boy, please excuse us. You're still our leader. Where's Samy? Leave, go and wash up. But the factory... The river was contaminated by accident, Candy Boy. It was an accident. That's a lie! Tell them! Get to bed. Put that out, now!
