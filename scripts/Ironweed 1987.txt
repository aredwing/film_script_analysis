You see jommen out well. -Where have you been given the shoes from? -Hospital. I received a total of dressen in the hospital. The doctor says I have cancer. It is the first time that I have received nothing. Cancer? It was bad. He says I want to die for-a-half years. So I said that I would drink me ihjel. So he said: "Do as you like. You're done." Yes, yes, Grandma ... It was then resentful. -Do you have something to drink? -I have one dollar. -I got it by a nurse. -So are we on the path. If we're going to find a job today and earn some money? I had some last night, but they are used up. We need a place to sleep. It may be cold in the night. Working where? At the cemetery. They will be grave. One guy said that they need people. Can you money or just a free grave when you walk honour? It may therefore be the same. I do not gidder digging my own grave. I knew Grogan when I was a boy. He owned all the power in the city. -He has not much left now. -Say it is not. People like him never provide a good arrangement. Tell me one thing ... Looking for a spessiell? Maybe. Would you like to be in such a stone? I have never heard of a boom that has been given a headstone. I do not need a stone. Only I do not are going to die alone. You will die first. So I send out invitations. Hey, Gerald. How is it, son? There's good up here. It's pretty view of the river. Are you aware of -- -That you are here along with the rest of the family?

You smatt out of bleia, and then your mother said: "At, no." We would pick up both. But we rrte you do not, for you as so strange. Broren, Billy, came in and said: "Why is Gerald so queer?" Damn, too. I remember it all together. I remember it all together. I remember even in the red and yellow fields in the linoleum ... ... that you landed on. Hello, Franny! Franny, trucks are here to run us back. -Do you know someone who is buried there? -Yes, a little boy. -Deaths him when he was small? -Yes, quite small. How did that happen? -He fell down. -Where? -On the floor. -On the floor? I come when a few times a day, -- -But I'm not dead yet. Yes, you think you are. What should we now? Why ask you about it? Do you have any deals? No. -Do you have tickets to the opera? -No. -I only want to know how I'm going away. -There have not known you for 20 years. Votes. We have to find out where Helen is. -What is called Helen? -Helen. -What else? -She has only one name. It is fine if you do not want to say it. It allows you to write up. If you want to eat at the mission tonight? The priest has on offer pretty good food. I got soup in which yesterday because I was so hungry, -- -But it was musty. Bomsene are just starving. They do not believe in anything. I lived here the time I was married. In the house. -When were you here last? -For 22 years ago. -Who lives there now? -Some I knew immediately.

Sporvognen a strike that year. Streikebrytere, streikebrytere! -I'd prefer not to meet someone. -Just go. Get the streikebryteren away! He has not allowed to run the stroller. Forsvinn from the track! Run back to stable. You do not have no past here. Skulls are crushed! I think you've killed him, Francis. It is best to tensions. -Why you killed me? -It was not on purpose. Why threw the stone, so I had kraniebrudd? The brain rant out, -- -And I died. Streikebrytere receive salaries that are deserving. You need not be thus? You stupid swine. You took from us the job, so we will not be able to support the family. And you who have failed your family? You have not been home in 22 years. I lost the little my son. He died. I could not take it. A tystar bounded off. You can not defend your action. It can I do this so! -What is it you can? -Damn to death scab! Can you sit down? -I am no death scab. -No, you look just like one. Just came with soup. Let me ask all of you fortapte and hopeless souls: Who gives you the opportunity for salvation? It makes Jesus. Jesus keeps what he promises. Will someone here to change his life? God says: Come to me. Take him at it. Kneler, and be saved. It is in order. Amen, brothers. Wake up, boom. Now comes supper. -Is not Helen arrived yet? -No. I have been here throughout the day. It is good to keep you from the rail. I think I have a job for you. -I dug in kirkegrden today. -Brilliant. -It's not great to grave. -Maybe this is better. Rosskam, skraphandleren, need a helper. If you are not drinking, you can earn a schilling. -I will talk to him. -Great. But I need a couple of socks. My own is horrific. Do you have grown up in a barn? Close the door. It is cold here in. -Where have you been? -It just blows you in? I could have been dead, without that you had marked it. Yes, when you just go your way. That's because you're using all our money on whisky. You are bad when you are drinking wine. But when you are drinking whisky, -- -Is a devil. -I have 6 dollars. -Yes? -Where are you from them? -I have worked on the cemetery. -Wonderful. -Wonderful. Brilliant. And you're sober. -And you eat. -Yes, and I do not drinking. It's really nice. I am proud of my sweet boy. Try these. They are good and hot. Exactly what I'm looking for, Thanks, Chester. Glad you are not drinking. You look healthy. -It is my mask for Halloween. -Do not say it. Preserve the faith. -And the little lady has a good thing? -I have it good. -What people priests themselves? -Be sure you as he does not take your socks. For 6 dollars, we can rent a room and a few suitcases and grammofonen. Do you know who is in the city? Oscar Reo. -He who sang in the radio? -Exactly. He drank away his career. Now he is not drinking. He is the bartender. I wrote fan letters to him. We were filled with him in New York, Pee Wee. Was it not in 2-3 days? A fine musical drunkard. Well, guys, it's closing. Francis, how should you sleep tonight? How you slept in the night? In Finnys wagon? No. I will under no circumstances in which more sleep. I slept with Jack. I thought not the bread you know about Jack and Clara longer. They are not the best I know. But the ga me, after all, a bed. Look at her. -Is she dead? -Hi, Sandra. That's Rudy. Are you dead or just full? She is the only full. She keeps it's not out longer. She's just an Eskimo. Eskimo or not, she's going to freeze out here. Dogs come and bits of her experience. -Is she boom or just for fylla? -She has been a boom in its entire life. No boom is my life. She must have been something else before. -She was a slut in Alaska. -And what was she before? That I do not know. She was perhaps just a little girl. It is thus something. A little girl are either boom or slut. She must be up and stand. You going to freeze in hjel. I slept out in the night, and it was cold. You need a bit of hot soup, so you do not freeze to the ice. -Who are you? -A boom that is bringing you soup. -Get me something to drink. -There, I have no money. She can not enter. Chester will not do this. -Should we let her freeze ihjel? -You know how he is. So we say it ... Get a hot soup bowl to her, and a carpet. Ambulansefolkene not take her. Only if she is going to forbl. So, we will have cut your neck over to her. What should she with an ambulance? She will only sleep from everything together. -She will not even freeze. -She's like ice. It may well freeze, even if one is full. -Here's some soup. -Soup. -Sloop-soup. -Yes. Take all the time. -She will not have it. -Yes, but she believed it was wine. She would be a nurse in Alaska. -Medical. -She would be a doctor. The doctor would that I was supposed to be a nurse. -And it would not you? -Yes. -But he died. -Jas. Love? Yes. Love. It gidder I'm not looking at. -For a beautiful voice. -Thank you. Something to drink? -llet see here. -You would not drink. No wine, no. I think I know you. You're right. But you had BART is not the last time we met. -You drank me full in New York. -In like manner. Francis Phelan. And this is the German-Rudy. -He's okay. But he is wrong. -Just my type. Pee Wee Packer. This is Helen Archer. She is with me. Ask me why. -I give a drink, Oscar. -I'm not drinking more. I have not given up yet. I wait until I will be retired. You are good enough. No one can see the difference for you and the gentlemenene there. Gentlemen and bomser ... There is no difference. Aside from that gentlemen would like to be like gentlemen, -- -And would like to bomser be as bomser. Have I right? -You are smart. -It was a great song you sang. I remember you sang it in the radio. I have even sung it. Where then? Where any time. Concerts. I sang in the radio each evening. Give a number. Not so that I look like. You can measure up with anyone here. -Flowers? -Yes. Now go up and sing. You should only take you out. Once Francis got money, He ran out and bought roses to me. We were nyforelsket. We had a great apartment in Hamilton Street. The infernal dead. They travel around together. -And there's the flowers. -Yes. I can not remember that you had a permanent resident. In 1935 we were here for 6 weeks. We were here almost a year. -I can not remember such. -He drank up the rent. We had to sell Steinway & Sons grand piano - and the beautiful china team. -"Buy the best," said my father. -Sing a number of us, Helen. -Come on. -No, no. -Can your friend "He's my guy"? -He can all songs. People loved the way I sang it on. We have a veteran who will sing a number for us. -The lovely Miss ... -Helen Archer. I sing it as the type of mine, Francis. I know a guy, / i and when I'm down / i fighters he sorrow for flight / i when he is an apprentice / i shy he never / i uanesett what others say / i he will not decide / i how I should be / i he likes me / i that I am / i when I'm sad, / i do I go to him / i for his heart / i is the size of a ham / i , he's my guy / i he's my guy / i I can not see the other / i he is tough, / i but his love is real / i he shares / i his last dollar with me / i I would rather have him / i with his 15 dollars a week / i than be entertained / i of an old millionaire / i he is a tax / i and I love him / i because he's my guy / i my guy is poor / i but I am sure / i he is better / i than most millionaire / i I am glad / i when he is with me / i we share the delight and sorger / i I like to sacrifice everything / i that he should have a good time / i he will make it the same for me / i he is always there / i in the storm, or sol / i and that's why / i I like him / i he's my guy / i he's my guy / i I see no one but him / i he is tough, / i but his love is real / i he shares his / i last dollar with me / i I would rather have him / i with his 15 dollars a week / i than be entertained / i of an old millionaire / i he is the best / i and I love him / i he's my guy / i he's my guy / i Helen, it can not be done better. -You are the star gave birth. -But are you there? Thank you very much. Lovely. Thank you. -Beautiful, old tart. -Not a bad thing. A drink on the house. -Is not it a wonderful evening? -The degree. The ultra-comfortable. Hello, go away! Forsvinn of here! The dogs are there forever. Damn. See here. Ormene creeps in and out. The creeps in the nose and mouth. -Go away from me. -I have money! They have taken the money! Svin! -What is it? -15 dollars! -They are gone. -15 dollars, Francis! Forget the money. We obtain a few more tomorrow. -Damn, too. -Bls in the money. Where have you 15 dollars come from? -They are from your son Billy. -You are full of fraud, woman. Sandra is dead. She has requested a die. Her life was not human dignity longer. I want to go into the church in the morning. What do I do with you now? You can be here. The beds are concerned, but you can sleep on a bench. It will, I prefer not to. We can go over to Jack. He said: Just came back. When we go there. You have to take advantage of Sandra, Pee Wee. -What is she to the last name? -The judge in that I do not. -It does not matter now. -There has never done. Rudy ... -I visited the grave of Gerald today. -Did you know? This is the first time, does not it? -Yes. -You think much of him at this time. I always think of him. I found the grave, and talked to him. How could you talk to him? I stood and spoke to the grass. I am just as crazy as Rudy. You are not crazy. This is because you've come back here. No ... It is not that. There was something Billy said. There, I have not told you. He says -- -That Annie has never told anyone that it was I who lost the child. Fortalt it to the police? Not to anyone. Neither of Billy or Peggy. Not to someone in the family. Is not it great? It's amazing that a woman -- -That has all that, not at all say it to anyone. You go and think of them. Maybe you should visit them. -It is not helpful. -So you will be made purely board. The dead dirtbag. There are friendly now. -What is wrong? -Alt. -You sang as a song. -Yes, I did it. I sang, while Sandra was lying and died there. She was to die. Her time was over. That, I believe not. I think we die, when we do not keep it out more. It takes so much you can, and then you die when you can. It sounds reasonable. Man dies when you can. It is thus well-we agree if anything for a change. We have it great. But we have neither the money or a place to sleep. -We are on the ground bar. -Yes, guess. Let's go over to Jack, before he closes and locks. Hi, Jack. We went just past. Draethu a small one? It is cold for October to be. There will be snow. Feel my hands. This is my home. I do not gidder to know in your hands or your head. I see that no snow. I got a little soup clock six. It's gone now. -I must have something to eat. -It's not my problem. -What about a mineral water, Helen? -Sounds good, Jack. -What kinds of mineral water? -The person you love. -Do you have the better, Clara? -No. What is it with your shoe? It is bound by a snor. -I have a lace. -Put it in then. This sweaters ... -Do you know where that is? -Find it and put it back in. -I am saying. -What? I am saying. There have, I do not want to. -Let me ask you about something. -No. What do you mean by no? Listen first what he will be asking about. How is it really? I have always thought that you were wise. But not when you are drinking as much. You could be a charming guy As always, had 20 dollars in your pocket. -There have I said to him, too. -You would use on her. -She will not sleep in ugresset. -I have not sunk so deep. It is not a long way to go. She slept in Finnys car in the night. Yesterday, and it was the last time. Have occurred and there will be, do I contact my parents. -They are pretty high on the straw. -You will have to at least contact them. Why do not you stop drinking? It is the use for people like you. You could have a gramophone like this. Is not it great? I have owned everything res before. If you do not take up together, you die. There has to secure the right in. -Can I borrow the toilet? -Be as good. You know that song, master? poor lamb, / i now is the fur cold / i wake in the morning traveller / i poor little lamb know / i what will happen / i life is an empty shell / i so let's go on loffen / i -Who was that he was not doing? -A hestetyvene.

I apologize that I almost shattering your head. But you asked for it yourself. I almost lost a finger. I could not use the right hand for a long time afterwards. But I bear no grudge For more than 5 years. See you. Thank you for your efforts. Is there anything wrong, Francis? Who are you talking to? Who are you talking to? I think in any uteliggeren that froze ihjel. Foxy Phil Took ... Stakkars froze completely corrupt. He had icicle of blood in his nose. The gadd not even to correct him out. The victim him in half a coffin. Hello, boom. River in a drink? I am no boom. I know it. You are a real guy. You work. I knew a guy once that is similar to a lot on Francis. -I liked him very well. -That, I believe certain. Guys were wrong for Clara. But she is pretty sick. That's why you can not be here. Let me say one thing: I look up to Clara. You are full. There may be a rest of life. Now, I leave you. -What should I come up against her? -The time is a lot of people. Yes, dear friends. Now the knalles pieces. Make a sandwich to me. -I take it with. -No! When you were hungry, you came home to me og tigger's future. -He asks only for a sandwich. -I set up a link to him. -Do you like strong cheese? -I love it. -Good night. -Good luck. See you. -Fryser you? -Yes. I can not be out in the night. When I die. -I had to have air. -It can not be far. -Take a bit. -This is when I kvalt. -You are going to like it. -I am no fraud. It is not I, either. I think I go to you. You are not correct sapiens. Therefore, you can not borrow a bed. -When I got my sandwich? -Yes, you are amazing. A worm. Stop glo at me that way. I crush you into the car. You have listed up as an idiot in 9 years. Jack said that I should be able to be here. But do not you, because you racket. -Now I eat the sandwich. -Make the final. And I am grateful for everything together. You are a true saint. You are not correct sapiens. -You're angry at you. -This is dog food. You make me crazy. Look to find you a place to sleep. -I call to my brother. -Fine. Call to him twice, so he can throw the pipe back on. -Do you have money to call for? -The raker you do not. You were straightforward enough before you started with all the wine. I retrieve some cardboard. So we sleep in the old building. -No, I can find me a place for themselves. -You do not have any places to go. -Are you having a chew on? -There have I ever tried before. Just turn. I do not turn up. I love you. You must not go your way. You go up just wild. -Fryser you? -Yes. I can not be out in the night. When I die. -Finny, there's the visit. -Who heck is it? Francis. Move you. Make room for Helen. -You get a bottle for it. -Fine. -Do not be afraid. -"Oh no. She has been here before. We hit her in the morning, or on the mission. Why do not you sleep here, too? There is no room for legs. Keep your courage up. No, I can not sleep here. I can only pray to God. Do not touch me there. It hurts. I have to talk to you. Forgive me for I have sinned. You call it sin. I do not call the decision-making. I am not Alkoholiker, and no man has used me for money. I have drunk for free many times. They were allowed to buy drinks, -- -For it is such men should. I have never deceived anyone. That's what matters. I have a good idea -- -That relations with Francis was sinful in someone's eyes -- -And that I have sloppy with the commandments. But nobody will get me to say that it was a sin to love Francis. For it has been ... ... the largest in my life. Now it's over. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The priest says you need someone with a strong back. Maybe so. Do you have one then? Raise the barrel. Can you promise res? I have lifted my life. You get 7 dollars, and work to what is dark. Ryggarbeid will provide 8-9 dollars. Families can buy food an entire week for 7 dollars. -7.50. -7. -Javel, it does not matter. -Jump Up on the planet. Hello! -Would you like to have the rest of the bread? -Sure. It's good bread, but I can not eat anything. A friend offered me a ostesmrbrd last night, but I was unable to do so. Get your avgrde. -What do you think of that? -Do what? Sex.
