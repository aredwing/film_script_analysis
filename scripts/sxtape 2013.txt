You and your boyfriend went in to film something. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. What... what were you filming? He was, uh... It was kind of stupid. He was making a movie about me, just about me painting, and we were going to do an art show. - That's great. - Yeah. That's great. He's really talented. Is he okay? He is not okay. Is he hurt? What happened? Is he at the hospital? Can I see him? Where is he? He's dead. What? What? - I'm s... - Where is he? What do you mean, he's dead? He's dead. He's dead and two others are missing. Oh, my God. We found the camera. Look how pretty this looks. It's my lace. Psh, psh, psh. What? Whoo! Nothing. This is my favorite. That's really good. So who is she anyway? Who is this? Well, it's supposed to be Tiffany, but I haven't really done her face yet. It's not very good. It is good. Just a minute. How's that look? It looks sexy. Thank you. Can you open this one? Oh, yeah! Yes. Does that mean I'll have to move out if I can't open the pickle jar? You can't open the pickle jar? My last boyfriend could open the pickle jar. Your last boyfriend was an asshole. Do you think I'd make a good teacher? An art teacher? No, like a gym teacher. Why would you want to teach? Because I need a real job... eventually. Some people work, Adam. Well... honey, that's why I'm going to make you into a star. I'm going to make us rich. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, I was counting on you to get rich. Oh... We've gotta work out a new plan. How talented? I mean, you've just gotta have more confidence in what you do. All the windows are open. Come to my fort. Wow, that's really nice. That's really pretty. Right now? Yeah. W-what are you doing? You naughty, naughty girl. Turn it off. I don't care. We can do it on camera. I don't care. I could, but I don't really trust you. You're gonna have to put that down. You want me to put it down? Really? Makes me nervous. Never made a sex tape before. We're not going to. Wait. Hear me out. This might sound a little crazy, but listen. This might be one way to get your art noticed. You know, it would get you out there, make you famous. Oh, yeah, that's what I need is a tape on the Internet. Yeah. Gotta be a famous person. Then you put your tape on the Internet. Maybe one comes between the other... Or before the other or in the middle of the other. I don't know. What do you think? Come on? It'll be fun. I think I want you to turn off the camera. Really? Yes. And fuck me. Oh, that camera again. Baby, what are you doing? Get away from the window. Honey. Get away from the window, honey. Are you trying to show the whole fucking street? Let them stare. Baby, come on. Oh, yeah. Look. There's people down there, honey. Is he... he's fucking looking up... Keep shooting them. I'm giving you this. And you're filming that little Mexican man with the ice-cream cart. You motherfucker. That's kind of cool. Get over here and put your dick in me. God, I love you. I love you. You love me today, huh? Oh, yeah. You're going shopping with me. Adam, what do you think? - I like them. - They look good? They look cool. Come here. What the hell is going on here? Uh... Go, go, go. I stole this butterfly. You stole it? Come on. We're gonna get in trouble. The woman. Hi. Hi. I think they're breaking up or something. Look. She's getting pissed. Stop shooting. Stop shooting. I'll pretend I'm telling a story. And then I said... Mm... You think she's going to cry? She's... she's the one doing it? These are really good. - He's looking at me. - Hi. Oh, Jesus. Stop filming. Turn it off. Feel better? Here we go. Okay. Enjoy, as long as it's off. Yes, ma'am, it's off. It's on the table. Sorry about that. There we go. The hat's over it. Okay. She's so fucking easy. He's still doing it. I'm not filming... - Think that would be best. - Hey. - If you want to come again, come again. - Thank you. That fucking asshole. Get in. Come on. Adam, get in. Just going to wedge in here. Somebody's coming. Shh. Quick, lay on top of me. Lay on top of me. Quick. Jesus Christ. Dude, do you have any change? Come on. We're not giving him any fucking money. Just gave him a fucking peep show, Adam. Look at this. I mean, it's like, what, a hundred degrees out? - Yeah, at least. - More than that? You wouldn't think we're in the middle of L.A., right? This is where all the stars go to die. So we're just going to keep going straight. Got a nice... nice little surprise for you, honey. Going to take the next right. Where are we going? How'd you find this place? Where are you taking me. Are we there yet? Do you believe in God? God. Okay, wait. Wait. If I'm not much mistaken, it's up here on the right. - Here? - Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so... wait, wait, wait, wait. Slow down, slow down, slow down. You see this place? They gotta go around. Give me one second. All these people. We're backing up the traffic. Sorry. All right. Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. So I googled this place, and this was a hospital for women who... who had been naughty and got themselves pregnant out of wedlock. Oh, no. They used to come here for abortions on the down low. So what we should do is, like, find a really amazing space like here, and we should do a show here. Do, like, an art show. Yeah. Yeah, like a spectacular show. Like go in there and do the whole place. Do the walls, do paintings, like we could have projections in there. That would be so fucking cool. Have a party, get a DJ, like, have a nightclub thing going in there and just... Oh, my God, can you imagine? Listen, baby. I don't want to go in there now. I wanna go in. Just keep going, keep going. I don't wanna go in there. I don't wanna blow anything. Baby. Okay, just slow down. Just pull over. I wanna grabs some shots. Let me get out of here. I need to check out who owns that. I don't wanna get thrown out, and then we won't be able to use it, maybe we won't want to use it, though. Let's just go and take a peek to make sure it's cool. Just look through the fence, and the we're going to go out. You're not coming? - Uh... - Hurry up. Fine. I'll just get another battery. Yeah. J... what are you doing? I... Look it. Can you see this crazy guy? I really... This is not safe, baby. Let's go. Walk to your right. Walk? To my right? That's right. Yes. And then we're going to go. Walking. You're going to see on your left-hand side a hole in the fence. There's no hole in the fence, baby. I don't see anything. There's no hole in the fence. Let's just go. There's no... Found it? Just climb through the hole. Baby, I'm not... please, I'm not climbing through this hole. Let's just go. Come on. Climb through the hole. Just fucking come here. Please, baby? I don't want to do this. Climb through the hole. Now walk to your left. Oh, yeah, you're gonna come. Yeah, right. You wish. Yeah, warmer. Warmer. I'm getting warmer? Now you're hot. Uh-huh. I don't see you, baby. Where the fuck... Oh, there you are. Ha ha, very clever. Baby, get up. This is just... You're such a filthy little tart. Look at you. Baby, let's go. This is not safe. Come on. Let's get out of here. You see that crazy motherfucker across the street? He's checking you out. Let's just go. I don't like this. Come on, scaredy puss. Hello? Think there's something. Hello. Hello. Is there anybody in there? Hello. Hello. Hello. I don't see anybody. All the windows look boarded. They're all boarded up. We're home. That... That's a really fun image. I like that. Oh, yeah, baby. I like it. Oh, shit. Sorry, let me change the filter. That's better. Oh, my God. Oh, it's so gross. Come here. Shh. Shh. Come here. Get the fuck out of there. Get the fuck in here. Just come on, babe. Please, please, please, please. You said you had a surprise. Surprise me. I did surprise you. You're being so predictable, Adam. Please don't call me predictable. - I hate being called predictable. - Please? You know, I actually do want to go through with it just get it out of the way. Now, stop talking about it. Let's do it. Come on. Hop over this. Come in. We're going to go for two minutes while the sun's still up, and then we'll come back out. I just want to see it. It would be so incredible. There's like a gallery in here. Just come on. Come on. Come on. Fuck. Did he see us? All right, come on... Shit, it's a fucking cop. He's coming. Come on. We've got to go inside. Come on. Sweetie, let's go. And he's fucking coming. Fuck. Get down. Get down. Put your head down. What should we do? Sheriff's department. The longer I chase, madder I get. There's a door. That's a 10-4. Oh, my God. I think he's gone. We probably shouldn't go out because he might be waiting out there. Maybe we can sneak out... Through the stairs, like a fire escape. Adam, come here. Adam, come here. Oh, my God, this is a masterpiece. Baby, you could put paintings everywhere. God. Be incredible. Like, you know, you wouldn't even have to clean it up. Like real amazing. Need a picture of you. My boyfriend, the camera. Ugh. This is a nice piece. Yeah, it's, like, basically you've got your whole show right here. I know. I don't even need to do anything. I could just let people come in and then buy pieces of old glass stained with shit. Everybody would think I was a genius. You are a genius, honey. Thank you. That. What is this? Duchamp. I should just sign it duchamp, and then it'll be a piece. Do you have a pen, darling? Yeah. No. Sorry. Don't have a pen. Oh, my God. I had one of these when I was a kid. This was my favorite. It's a kids' room, huh? I guess so. Oh, look at this little unicorn. I had one of these. His name was Pequod. He was huge, though. He was a giant purple fancy unicorn. And I accidentally lit him on fire. I lit his face on fire, and I got paint all over him. And I slept with him, and he was so beautiful. Jill? Jill. Jill, did you hear that? Was that you? No. Do you think it's the cop? Maybe he came back? Should we hide? I don't think... Shh. Shh, shh. Listen. Shh. Baby, shush. I'm being serious. Just listen. I don't hear anything, Adam. I hear something. I promise you. What are we listening for? Listening's no fun. Hello? Don't shoot. I don't hear anybody. Who, look at this. Whah... What? What the fuck was that? That was me. Adam, fucking serious. You scared me. Come here. Look at this. Just one second, baby. I heard something. I swear to God. Will you come kill this ant, Adam? Wait, wait. He's coming near me. Baby, I just want to see what's down here. I'll be right back. Adam, what are you doing? Just having a look around, baby. Careful, that... Adam. Jesus. Whoa. I want one. Those are incubators, right? What do you do with it? What are you doing? That's for babies. Look at this. Oh, my God, there's blood in it. This one does, too. Whoa, look at this. See? This some s&m shit. Wow. No, baby, that's for your ankles, not your... Oh, I see. The other way around. Like this? Oh, I see. You want me to lay down on it. Yeah. Strange idea. Why would you want me to do a thing like that? What was that? Shh. What? Was that thing there before? Uh, yeah. Hm. Hey, Jill. Jill. Let's go back in there, and let's just fucking do it. You're really turning me on right now. Think we should go in there and let me pull your dress... Yeah, uh-huh. And just bend you back over the bed and, you know, just... Fuck off. You know what? I think I should strap you in here. What do you think? Is that crazy? It would be kind of sexy? Like we could project it on the walls. Like when we do the show. That would be such a cool image because we could use it. We could use it, like, as a loop. Oh, that would be cool, like right behind the actual bed. We could Photoshop it so you just get the image of me, and you could project me so it looked like I'm all on the bed. Do you know how to do that? Is that doable? Yeah, I think it could be doable. Yeah. This is so dirty. Don't even know if I'm into it. I will never be able to put you in those restraints. Why not? I can't, not while I'm holding the camera. Then turn it off. Come here. Let me put the camera down then I'm going to tie you up. Let me just... All right. So how do you feel. Can you move at all? No, not... like your whole body. Can you move your body? Really try. Like move your whole body. Really try. Get out of there. I'm not going anywhere. Uh-oh. Try as hard as you can. Harder. Try a bit harder. Is that all you got? All right. I can do whatever I want to you. Like what? Anything. Like whatever I want. What do you want to do? Do you want to play scrabble? Yeah, that was the first thing on my mind. What if I just left you here and I cam and got you in the morning? I would be pissed. Really? I would feel bad. If I just left the camera on and I came back in the morning. It would be such a cool projection. Can you imagine? Yeah, like, put it on the wall, - you getting more freaked out. - That's not funny. Come on, baby. Just think of that. - That's stupid. - No, it's not. Don't even say that. That's dumb. Good-bye, darling. It's been fun. - Sleep tight... - That's not funny, Adam. - Adam. - Bye. Bye-bye, honey. Bye, darling. Adam. Hey. What? How mad at me are you? Whuh? Were you scared? I don't get scared. Whuh. I found some cool places. I'm sorry, baby. I took it too far. Didn't I? All right, let me get you out of this. I'll untie you. I'm sorry baby. It was just a joke. Should I take this... I'm okay. I'm all right. Yeah? I am happy in my little place. Do you... wanna do it? You really want to do this? This feels good. This feels perfect. Okay. Oh, fuck. Ah, yeah. Oh, fuck. Don't stop. Wait. Wait, baby. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh, Jesus Christ, you're bleeding, baby. Hold on, hold on, stop. Oh, my God, fuck. Baby, you're bleeding everywhere. - I'm fine. - What the fuck? I mean, Jesus. Are you okay? Wait a minute. I'm fine. All right, hold on. You... Fuck. Okay, you need to sit... You need to sit... sit up. I'm sorry. I'm tied up, Adam. Are you feeling any better? I'm fine. You sure you're okay? God. Fuck, I'm bleeding again. Okay. Just... yeah, just keep your head back. That's good. Motherfucker. Hello? Hello. Hello? Maybe it's pipes. Pipes? I just turned on that sink. Oh, fuck. Hold on... - Wait, baby... - I'm not going down there. No, Adam. Baby, just hold onto me. Let's... I'm gonna get... Come on. Come on. Jill, let's go. Come on. Come on. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Shh. Fuck. Go, go. Go, go, go, go. Let's just go. Quick. Come on. Yeah, yeah. Forget the fucking camera. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! Wait! Wait! Wait! Fuck! Honey, where you going? Jill, it's going to be okay. It's not okay, Adam. Elly, can you please come? It's an emergency. My car got towed, and my nose won't stop bleeding, and I don't feel good. We... are you going to leave right now? Okay, thank you, Elly. Fuck. All right, I'll... it's... What's the address? I don't know. What's it say on the corner of the street there? We're at six... we're at sixth street and... And St. Louis. This is one of those moments that we talked about, where you stop filming. You don't film everything. Please, Adam. I just want to make sure you're okay. That's all. I'm okay. Yeah? Just please stop filming. What happened to your nose? - I've never seen anything like that. - I don't feel good. I don't... That's fucking crazy. I don't know. I used to get nose bleeds when I was little. I just got a nose bleed. Is it still all over the place? Let me see. Turn to me. Will you stop filming me? I don't want to be bleeding on camera. I don't feel good today. Okay? Look. Get your shot? Did you get your fucking shot, Adam? Look at that. Is that them? Hi. - Hey. - Hello. You looking for a date? What are you guys doing here? Oh, camera guy. Beating her now? Is that right? Douchebag. Wow, what is it? Is it like a... like a hospital? We really like it. There's a ton of tagging all over the place. You should really go tag it up. What are you guys doing right now? Jill's not feeling great. We want to get her home. She looks fucking awesome. I just want to take Jill home. She's not feeling well. Oh, fuck, let's go. I don't care. You guys wanna see it. I'll go look. Yeah, I mean... um, yeah. I think we should go. Jill. It's just hot. You feeling bad? Shit all over fun.

Elly will help you. Yeah, okay? Why are you being such a pussy? I'm not being a pussy. Yeah, you've been. All right, I'm being a pussy. What do you want? I don't know. Why are you being so scared about this place? Scared? I'm just... you know... If you'd seen her, like, two minutes ago, she was like, "get me out of here. Get me out of here." - Then suddenly fucking Bobby comes in... - Oh, really? Let's go inside. No. No, Bobby. What do you mean, no? I mean no. Dude, you don't have to go inside. You can sit out here and film your own dick if you want to. We're going to go inside and fucking have some fun, check some shit out. That would be a really good movie. You could call it the tiniest dick ever. Oh, wow. Wow, that's... that's so funny. It's funny 'cause it's true. Not saying anything. Do you think that's cool? What, tagging? Jill, do you think that's funny? I mean that. Do you think that's funny? Seriously. It's not funny. I was just kidding. Do you mind? Adam, how's this shot look right here does that look good? Oh, I can see up your skirt. Wow. Come on. Okay, I'm coming. Hold on. Wait up. Adam. Why are you acting so weird? Just stop it. I love you, Jill. This is like the worst... energy. Really?

Yeah, turn it on. Oh, that works. Holy shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa, look at this. Look at this. My God, they're still working. This is so creepy. Do you guys know how long ago this place was... I don't think people will want to come here for an art show, honestly. You know, I really think we need to get out of here, guys. Babe, you know as well as I do, we heard somebody in here. It could be like gang activity or anything like that here. We don't know what's here. This is a big place. I just feel that we need to get out of here. We should go. I got a little surprise for you all. Dude, what the fuck is that? It's protection. It's like insurance. Oh, jeez. Why don't you get your fucking camera out of my face before I shove it up your fucking ass, dude. See, Adam, I told you nobody likes to be shot. Seriously, don't touch my fucking lens. Seriously. Don't put it in my fucking face, dude. - Well let's... - Stop it. Get out of my fucking face. I mean, seriously. Keep talking and I'm going to put something else in your fucking face. What? Yeah, yeah, why don't you just try it, buddy. I don't think you should tempt me. We're in a fucking abandoned place. Nobody would come looking for your for fucking weeks probably. By the time they found you, rats will be eating out of your... Oh, don't be so certain. Okay, that's all I can say. Don't be so certain. Don't be so certain I won't come back there and beat the fucking shit out of you, dude. Is he really always such an asshole? Uh... You guys, you're scaring me. Stop it. We're grownups, you and I. - Right? - What? Come on, Jill. Jill, let's just get... I'm feeling uncomfortable. Let's just get out of here. Come on. What's the matter? Thank you. Let's go. Jill. Yeah. I'm calling... Honey, you okay? You okay? Thanks, Bobby. Of course. - Good catch. - Don't look at me like that. Good catch. Be careful, there's one behind you. Your girl needs to be careful, Adam. Yeah, Adam... somebody needs to take care of me. I mean, seriously? I'm just getting tired of this. I don't know. Bobby, stop it. It's not what it looks like. I swear to God. I swear. - He's just... - Stop. Show me around. Oh, God. Tie me down and tickle me. - Bobby. - What? Leave her alone. Why not instead of me leaving her alone, you let me take the camera, and that way we won't be doing anything behind your back. You can sit at home and watch it and ft, ft, ft, ft, later. You know? Fuck you. - Yeah, Bobby. - Her first. Fuck me. Hey, is that what you want, baby? It's not funny anymore. You wanna fuck this moron? Is that what you want? Why not? Sure, Bobby. That's really what I want. Jill, come on. Jill. You're killing me. You're killing me. Jill? Jill, come here. Let's go. You are suffocating me. You are taking the life out of me. Bobby, what the fuck are you doing? Where? Where? Where are we going? I don't have a car. Everybody fucking stop. Bobby, stay out of this. Okay? We're here. We're going to fucking check it out. Let's just fucking walk around. You have to stop fighting now. Stop! Adam. Don't fuckin' touch her like that, man. Don't point that fucking gun at me, okay? Don't fucking touch me. Don't fucking tell me where to point my fucking gun. Stop it. What the hell is going on? You fucking stop it. Shut the fuck up, bitch. You shut up, asshole. Come on. Let her the fuck go. Let her the fuck go, dude. Let me... I'll put it right through your fucking camera. Eat shit, Adam. You're a loser. You follow me, I'll shoot your bollocks off. - Let's go. - No, no, Adam. Fuck this guy. Calm down and let me. Let me. He has a gun. I don't give a fuck that he's got a gun, okay? I'm going to shoot the fucking guy in the face. Let me fix this, okay? This is bullshit. Nobody talks to me like that. - Let me fix it. - Nobody talks to me like that. Adam, calm down. I do not care, okay? I don't care. Adam, just stay here, please? Okay, I don't want you to get hurt. Okay? Fine, you got two minutes. Okay. Okay, five. No, no, you got two minutes, and then I'm coming. All right, fine, two. I don't care. Just... Jill! Fuck it. Pick up. Hi, you've reached Jill's cell phone. I'm not here right now. - Please leave a message after the meow. - Fuck you. Meow. Jill, where the fuck are you? Call me back. Please. It's not funny. Just... just call me back. Jill? Jill. Jill! What the fuck is... What the fuck is... Jill? Fuck. Jill? Jill, are you... are you okay? Fuck, what just happened? Are you... Adam. What's going on?

They just left you down here? Where's Elly? I didn't see Elly, Adam. You were with Elly. Yeah, yeah, but she came to look for you. She did... what, she didn't find you? Adam, stop. Stop, Adam. This is not all right. I'm so scared. Oh... Isn't that Elly's flashlight? Yeah. So... I don't understand. So you did see her. Jill, you did see her. I saw her earlier. You were there, too, Adam. You look first, Adam. What? You go. You've got the flashlight. - You go. - You've got the... Just shine it up there. I'll be right behind you. You should stop filming, Adam. What? You should stop filming. There's fucking blood everywhere. Okay? I'm film... we need evidence. You're having fun and then you're... I'm not having fun, baby. This is for... this is for the fucking police. Do you understand that? The show must go on. What? I said the show must go on. Um... There's no... There's no... There's no way to open it. Jill. Jill. Jill. What? Did you fuck Bobby? No, I didn't fuck Bobby, Adam. What did you do, you kissed him? Yes, we kissed. You kissed him, what, like... You and I kissed. We kissed. Like what? Yes, I mean with tongue, we kissed each other. Do you really want to talk about this right now? Honestly? I said I was sorry. I'm sorry. It makes no sense. He just left you here? - I don't understand. - Elly saw us kissing. Elly was so mad at me, and Bobby was so forceful. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you mean he was forceful? He didn't rape you, did he? No, he didn't rape me. No worse than you do, Adam. What is that supposed to mean? Hello? I really am sorry. It was awful. I feel sick about it. I'm so sorry. - I know you are. - I love you so much. I love you, too, sweetie. The stairs are down here. I know where we are. Oh, good, it's an elevator. These are the stairs. Adam. No. These are all people. These are all real people. With lovers and dogs... And problems. Okay. "Colette Mcleod." Suicidal tendencies. Primary diagnosis. Self harm. Aggression. Scratch and biting. Performed lobotomy. Performed lobotomy... On April 31st, 1982. No, no. Jill, can we please go? There's no way out, Adam. What do you mean there's no way out? I mean we've been looking, and there's no way out. Nobody gets out of here. Look at all these fucking files. Nobody gets out of here, Adam. Jill, just g... I'm really getting freaked out. I don't want to be here anymore. Then go, Adam. Go. What? Go. Go, Adam. All right... Fuck. Are you okay? Oh... I need to get you to a doctor. Um, stairs. What are we looking for? We're looking for a way out. There's light coming from this way. No. No. Mm-mm. We've been here before. This isn't it. Wait, wait, wait, we came down here. And we're back... fuck. All right, let's go back up. That light just went on. Elly? Elly? I don't feel good. What is it? There's someone over there, Adam. Someone's standing there. Hello? Oh, my God! Oh! Oh! Oh! Jill, shine the line on... Jill... Hello. Let's go. Shh, shh, shh. Okay. Hello? I want to go home. Oh, fuck, Adam. Fuck. Adam. Oh, Adam. 911 emergency services. Hi, we have... we have an emergency. We are...
