I know, I'm messing with you. Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday, kid. How are you? - Good. - Yeah'? How's the job? Good? Yeah, they took all real well actually. I'm in this new working group on cybersecurity. Oh wow. That didn't surprise me at all. You know it's super important stuff. That's why they got me working over the holidays. Listen, dad, thanks for calling but I gotta get back to it. My boss is asking for me. Oh, okay. Alex, wait. Before you go, don't forget I love you, okay? All right, I love you too... Just a moment ladies and gentlemen. We're getting reports that there's been a major attack on the Pentagon. The first live satellite images are just coming through now and... Oh my God, the building just looks practically leveled. We don't know the number of casualties just yet, but first responders are on the scene and they're trying to put out the fire and find as many bodies as possible. You reached Alex Norris. You know what to do. Alex, hey. Hey, kid, it's your dad. I think we got... And as you can see by the live feed, visibility is a major issue for rescue crews. We got disconnected. Disconnected. Stay tuned to Channel 5 News and we'll bring you all the latest updates as they come. Our prayers go out to all the family members... The most significant attack on American soil since 9/11. Just one of several attacks from a terrorist cell... Communication to an ISIS official and military official has collapsed... A question of US retaliation... The President is meeting with his Security Council to discuss options... The Defense Department is meeting with several military contracting companies and weapon specialists. Sources are telling me that military officials have reached out to the CEO of BlackSun Weapons & Technology Kyle Norris for a... To stop the waste of human life and senseless acts of terror. The global community has responded with a tremendous... Today, the White House has declared a new war on terror. All in Zulu 6. Oscar, this is Zulu 6, Oscar. All right, boys, keep it calm and keep it steady. We're almost home. Sir. All clear on this, I got you. Go, go, go! Move! Move! Copy. I got rear cover. Comms down! Comms down! Goddamn it. Okay, okay. Look at me, we are not gonna die today, soldier. Do you hear me? so I'm gonna get to the top of that mountain and I'm calling for an emergency evac. Now, I need you to stay safe and I need you to slay alive. We are going home. Della squad to FOB, we are under heavy fire. Requesting emergency evac and immediate air support. 10.33.35. Fuck me. Attention on deck! Impressive operation, gentlemen. Look, Norris, let me be frank. Better tech, better mechanics makes for better execution of our operations which will help us to bring our sons and daughters home safely. Gentlemen. And as of right now we're getting our asses handed to us. No matter what we do we're always a step behind. And damn it, I want I! to end. I want it end now. Hunting these bastards down is a nightmare. I mean our intel on the region is getting better but with signal jammers blocking satellite imaging, what the hell am I gonna do? With more young lives thrown away. Nothing worse than wasting the lives of our next generation. Prayer services are being held by numerous world leaders in an amazing show of solidarity. Memorial services are being held almost around the clock at numerous houses of worship representing all religions as the nation mourns those we lost. A lot of questions about the government's relationship with BlackSun Weapons & Technology. Senator Jones, your thoughts. Weapons being regulated is the only answer. Kyle Norris is... Wanna find dad? Where is he parked? There he is. You gonna show him all the brand new things you got? Yeah. Yeah? Look at these beautiful ladies. Go at the back. Okay, look, I know I'm just a driver but you two are killing me. But, daddy, it's my first one. Okay, I can't, I can't. Please. What? It's just a bra. Daddy, doesn't wear bras. No, daddy doesn't wear bras, okay? Okay.- All right, baby, are you ready? YUP. - I think it's past someone's bed time. Daddy? Shh. Go back to sleep, princess. You're okay. I love you. You know, you still have to lake those down. I know. It's hard. She'll always be daddy's girl. Call from Phil Ross. Answer. Mitch, where the hell are you? You need to get outta here right away. You heard Phil. Mm-hmm. 49013390. All right. I love you. I love you. You want milk, or sugar, or? Just dark. All right, is that it? That will do it. Cool. Here you go. Have a good one. You too. Oh, hi Jack. Good morning, Ms. Grace. How are you? I'm good. I'm doing phenomenally. Do you want your usual? Yeah, sure. How are things? Things are good. Things are busy. Yeah, it's been a good morning. It's starting to slow down a little bit. You look absolutely beautiful. You say that every day. And I mean that every day. Jack, are you okay? Give me one minute. Jack? Jack? Are you okay? Shut the fuck up! You have the right to remain silent. Pick 'em up. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. You've got the right to... Been trying to reach you all morning. What's going on? Mass shooting at a downtown hotel lobby. I'll lake lead. Lock, I am telling you, Detective, like I told the other officer, I did not kill those people. I am telling you the truth, okay? What did your lie detector tell you? What did your test tell you? Please listen to me. Look at me! I swear to God, check your result, check your machine, do whatever you gotta do but please believe me. Look, Jack, I just wanna get to know you for a second, okay? A lot has happened. Brother Jack Simon, served two tours in Iraq, honorably discharged after your entire unit was blindsided by a group of insurgents. That must've sucked, pal. I know you got a lot going on upstairs right now, all right? So I just wanna show you something and then ask you a few questions, okay? Nice and easy. Nice and easy, right? Turn it off. I said turn it off, please. Okay. - That's not me. This is telling me different, Jack. I could never do that to someone. I could never. You're looking at seven counts of premeditated murder, son. Eight counts. Another woman just died in the hospital. You two, a minute, now. Be right back. Listen, guys, we all agree it's a terrible tragedy what happened this morning but Homeland Security and FBI both want in on this guy. I'm gonna turn him over. We'll do what we can for the victims and their families and that's it. Let's wrap it up, okay? What's wrong with the world today? Ton many goddamn agencies. None of which work together. Don't break my balls. Let's just wrap it, Phil, please? Come on. All right. You okay, Jack? I'm guilty, I did it. You got me, you caught me. I'd like to see my lawyer, please. Can I get that in writing? Sure. Now we know you're guilty. Why d'you do it? I got a simple answer for you, Detective. John Kennedy once said, The cost of freedom is always high "but Americans have always paid it." "And the path that we'd never take" is to choose the path of surrender or submission. Now sometimes innocent people must die in order for us to follow that path. Murder is never acceptable. Now I want you to look at me. There's no such thing as murder in war, soldier. Jesus Christ! Get in here! I gotta tell you how many hours I've been on the phone getting my ass chewed off because of this. Captain, you were there. Obviously, the guy was suffering from some severe form of PTSD. There was nothing that we could do. It's all a matter of perspective. You two were in the room with him. Internal Affairs is already asking too many questions. So you both anchor to your desks until this investigation is finished. That's ridiculous, man. That's all. Get out. Phil, give me a minute. How's our boy doing? Fine. Why? I know he's been cleared for duty but keep an eye on him. Two eyes. Oh God, I've seen that look before. Jack Simon. You ever seen someone change like that? You mean, change a story? Yeah. Mitch, you don't have to think that hard about it. Obviously, the guy had some serious issues. Maybe. I gotta go- - You do remember what behind the desk means, right? I did not kill those people. No such thing as murder, soldier. That was something you did. You did this. And sometimes innocent people must die. Have you meta stranger today, right? Mitch? Detective Walker. Listen. If you want the truth, Detective, tomorrow you run through the park and I'll he by the fountain at 7. And don't be late. Work? No. Wrong number. Hey, babe? I wanted to remind you, I have post-ups all week and a double bypass this afternoon. You'll get Katie from school? Yeah, I can do that. Don't be late. Sorry about the late night call. I'm not much of a sleeper. Haw can I help you, pal? Professor Peterson, Clarence. Jack Simon didn't kill those people. Okay, thanks. Good talk. Listen, I'm sorry, Detective. Loan'! Tell you more. I'm putting my life at risk just even speaking to you. A risk from who? Just, listen. They wanted the senator dead. All the rest of 'em there was just fucking collateral damage to sell the story that it was a random shooting and not an assassination. All the others that got shot that was bullshit. Okay, who wanted him dead? Why? Complicated. The shooting was both a demonstration and a warning. What's this? That's all the proof you need. Proof? This is not proof. How were you involved? Listen, time's up. You just lack into it, Detective. And I promise, all your questions will be answered. Detective, don't come looking for me or you're gonna be risking both of our lives. You just have to trust me. Just trust me and you'll uncover the truth. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Is this absolutely necessary? Too precise. So you saw Jack Simon almost every morning for about six months? Yeah. He seems like a nice guy. So on the morning of the incident, was he acting any different? Other than blowing up the place? That's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Let me rephrase. Tell me what happened. He was going about his normal daily routine. He didn't say anything unusual. And all of a sudden it's like he switched off, like nothing going on behind the eyes, like a different person, you know? Today is May 2nd, 2017. And it's our first successful recording of hybrid dream. Vic! Victor! Hey! Victor! Come here. What are you doing? Get down. I'm just... I'm not here to arrest you, son. Okay- - Come on. What are you doing? Just going for a jog. Oh, yeah? I felt tired. Hmm. I needed to jog. Get the blood circulating. All right, nutbag. I need your help. Come on. Jesus Christ, you got me all sweaty, Vin. I don't need to hear about your personal issues. If you ever make me run like that again I'm gonna shoot you in the knee cap. I need to find out what's on that. I looked at it but all the files are encrypted. Where did you get it? What the fuck is this? Nu idea. This maybe. Oh, come on. You're still playing poker online'? YUP- - You never win. Still winnin'. Never winning. Yup, indeed lam. And I'm doing very well, thank you very much. Yeah, fucking degenerate. Let me know what you find out. It's not a degenerate sport. It's actually very smart. Fucker. It's another beautiful morning here on the south land, but keep those umbrellas close because we've got a low pressure system headin' our way that brings with I! A 70% chance of rain. Stay tuned for weather updates on the hour, but right now it's time to get back to the oldies on 97.3 KBSG. Senator Jones was shot three times center mass. It's precise shooting, Phil. FBI closed that case. So even if there is something bigger goin' on it's not our case anymore. Now let's get back to some real police work, cases that are still open. I don't know, man. I mean the victim just seemed so random. The senator was the target. Come on. It's just no! Adding up. Look, the shooting, the lack of motive, the polygraph. Feel like taking a ride? Yeah. I got that address. Mr. Peterson? Professor. My name is Detective Ross and you've met my partner. I'm sorry, but you don't look familiar. May we come in? We need to ask you a few questions. So what is this about? The shooting downtown. We spoke about it at the park. I haven't been to the park in weeks. I'm good with faces. I'd certainly remember if we've met. When you spoke with my partner you said you believe the man who was responsible was innocent. I assure both of you gentlemen I have no idea what you're talking about. And if you don't mind I'm late for an appointment. It's okay. We'll see ourselves out. Real quick. Do you mind if I use your bathroom? Last roam on the right. Thank you. Yeah, sorry about all of this. We gotta be thorough when we investigate something like this. It's a real tragedy what happened to those people. You know, I've been studying your research. What a powerful stuff. A little above my pay grade but you wouldn't happen to know where I could find. Dr. Chris Downey, would you? Sure. Mission Cemetery. Chris died eight months ago. Well, if you change your mind. Like I said, Detective, we never met before today. Gut it. Satisfied? This ain't right. That guy was not in the wheelchair two days ago, all right? He was walking around like you and me. The guy called me over, looked me right in the eye standing up, told me this whole story about all this bullshit. I hate to tell you this, Mitch. Bu! He's been in that wheelchair for four years. It's in his file. You think I'm losing my fucking mind'? The captain told you to slay behind the desk. Phil. Let it go. Good morning. Thank you for calling BlackSun Weapons & Technology. Can I help you? I'm sorry. Mr. Norris is not available right now. Yup, bye. Good morning, Alice. Oh, Mr. Norris, Clarence Peterson unsuccessfully tried to access our server this morning. The professor forgot his password? Well, was he having some problems? Let's see if we can help him out, okay? Yes, sir. Yeah, I was just gonna report in. There were just two detectives here asking questions. Really? What did you tell them? I told nothing. Someone tried to access your server, Professor. Did you know that? Hey, look, don't Worry about it. I'll handle it like I always do. Be careful, honey. You don't wanna spill it on your clothes. Mom would know we had ice cream. Katie? Katie! Stay dawn, honey. Stay down! What the hell happened, Mitch? There was a guy. He had a gun. I don't know. And everything happened so fast. You don't know? What do you mean you don't know? What the hell could be so important that you weren't paying attention to the road? No, I was paying attention to the road. It just... Okay- You know what? I can't Do this right now. You should go. Angela. Angela. Mr. Peterson, it's not too late to tell us what you know. You hear that asshole? Fuck your mother. Did you know there was a little girl in that oar and now she's in intensive care? We know you're involved somehow. But guess what, asshole? Due to lack of evidence we have to let you go. Today's your lucky day. Mitch. You think I don't know you're having trouble right now? But I told you to leave Peterson alone. You had no probable cause to arrest him. I'm asking for five minutes with him, Captain. I know he's involved somehow. No, we are releasing him because we have no reason to hold him. And I am not gonna bend the rules for you. Now, I gave you a warning and things are beyond fucked up now. You left me no options here. I gotta suspend you. This is bullshit, Captain. You fucking bang my desk like again I'll fucking kill you! Who the fuck do you think you are, hotdog, huh? It's a paid leave. Go home. Enjoy your wife. It's a holiday. Don't make me take this to another level, okay? Oh, come on. Don't go there. Yes, sir. Hey. Hey! What? What the hell were you thinking arresting Peterson? I mean, what good would this be doing Angela and Katie if you're fired? Do you think I give a shit about this job right now? Here's what I know. We go see Clarence, someone tries to kill me. Come on, you're not thinking rationally. You don't know, Phil. You weren't there. San of a bitch. Yo! Nat a good time, Vic. It's nanotechnology. And it's fucking out of this world, crazy fucking technology. What does that mean? I have no fucking idea. What? I have no idea. I don't even think that people who designed it know what it actually does. And what about the drive? Technology this advanced can only be used for military uses. Okay, that means nothing to me, Vic, if I don't know what it does. Look, I managed tn download some of the code from this tech. I had to slop because it started to call home. Home? What do you mean? What's home? I didn't wail to find out. Look, I don't want anything to do with this. Hey, you're the only person I can (rust, the only person with the skills to do this. You owe me. I don't owe you shit. No, I already paid you back. I already paid you back. And if I didn't, you'd be in a B by 10. I need your help. Please. I don't know. All right, but neither of us are gonna like what I find on this. Somebody's been talkin'. I swear to God. I swear to God, I haven't said a word. Listen, you promised to get me out of this fucking chair if I helped you. Now I got the cops at my door. I want out. You want out? Okay, you're out. Take Mr. Peterson home. Yes, sir. Yes, sir? One more thing. I wanna avoid any potential leaks. Find out what this detective knows, okay? Use the wife. You sure? Yeah. Do it. All right. I'm so sorry. There's still time to tell me the truth. The truth. Yeah. Whose truth, Kyle? You like that tea? Oh fuck! You've been feeding that cop breadcrumbs. You want out? You wanna get out of that chair? Now you're out. You got what you wanted. Snitch! Bullshit algorithms. Yeah? We have a non-authorized attempt to access the sewer. Where did it originate? We're attempting to pinpoint that now, sir. If that drive falls into the wrong hands. Yes, sir. Find out. Go! Identity verified. Welcome, Mr. Norris. Hello. Hey. How you doin', man? Just calling to check in with you. You all right? How you think I'm doin', Phil? That son of a bitch put my baby girl in the hospital and I need answers. Don't even think about it. I'm going to talk to Peterson. Just stay put, Mitch. Sorry. I know what I need to do. Just stay right... Shill Peterson. I just need to ask you a few questions. Mr. Peterson. I'm not here to arrest you. Peterson, I'm not here to arrest you, man. I'm just... Mitch, I know you're here. I saw your car outside. Phil. Come on, man. You don't think I killed him. He was like this when I came in. Mitch, I don't know what's goin' on with you. But I'll give you one hour then I gotta call this in. Thanks, Phil. Shill. Welcome home, honey. I thought you'd be at the hospital with Katie. I missed you. I came home to be with you. What's the matter, baby? Don't you want me? Angela, I need you to listen to me, okay? Something happened. You could not come back to this house. I need you to go back to the hospital with a security and wait for my call. Okay. - Do you understand? Calm down. Angela, listen to me. I'm not fucking with you. - Baby. - What are you doing? Relax, baby. You don't want me? What the fuck? What the fuck are you doing? I thought you liked it rough. What are you doing? What are you doing? He's out and ready for transport. Good work. Sir? He might have suspected I wasn't her. You're coming to my recital, right'? Of course I am, baby. Katie! You're coming to my recital, right'? Of course I am, baby. I wouldn't miss that for the world. Good morning sunshine. What d'you do with my wife, you son of a bitch? Maybe something, maybe nothing. Look familiar? No. No. Oh, come on, Detective. Do you think you'd be here if I didn't know that you know what this is? Okay, look, let me ask you a question. You wake up one day and all of a sudden you have the power to cure all diseases, stop hunger, eliminate all racism and end wars. Bu! The price for this is you have to kill a child, just one, a small innocent child. Could you? Could you kill that child to solve the world's problems and save the human race? Now, there's a twin drive with that power and I know you tried to access our encrypted files. Go fuck yourself! Now tell me, just tell me where it is. Come on. Tell me. You're not saving lives. No. You're just a murderer. There is no murder in war! I wanna come over there and beat you to fucking death with my fucking fist, but I'm not gonna. 'Cause I'm a gentleman now. There was a time when I was a killer. Motherfucking American soldier. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? I'm a patriot trying to protect our freedom and safeguard our way of life. And though there are some even though we loved that they die those sacrifices may have saved millions. Now are you, are you a solider? Are you prepared to die for your country? One more chance. Where is it? Fuck you! Doctor. Starting the countdown now. New listen to me, the price of freedom is always high but Americans, true Americans, have always paid it. But the path that we shall never choose is the path of surrender and submission to some cocksuckers, some rag head motherfuckers, some Nazis, some fucking British pricks, we ain't taking that path. You're on the wrong side, soldier. You're on the wrong side. And if that drive falls into the wrong hands our work will have been for nothing. And trust me, you stupid motherfucker, I will not let that happen. Good afternoon and get fucked. Mr. Norris, Team 1 is waiting for you in Bay 7. It's time. Let's go. The worst of all, gentlemen, weapons are stronger, more accurate than our soldiers, more vulnerable to field. But what I'm about to show you now, sir, our soldiers will no longer have to fear death. A soldier who's experience in training can't be snuffed out. Listen to the bullet. The ultimate weapon. Okay, how long before these units are ready for combat? Two weeks. Okay, interesting puppet show. But you gotta remember, I got real soldiers on the ground. I mean, we need stealth. I mean, the element of surprise. You know what, we need to see the results. You need some dead bodies and I got 'em. Follow me. Welcome hack, Dr. Downey. Could we have some privacy, please? I like the subject to be relaxed. Lock engaged. Detective Walker. Chris Downey. We sorta met before with my older partner Peterson? What do you mean your old partner? There are things going on here that you cannot possibly understand. Welcome back, Mr. Norris. System activated. Gentlemen, from the central control for the Subconscious Organization Application Protocol or SOAP as we call her. 60 seconds to subconscious transference. Live feed on screen. Pod 3 ready to initiate SOAP. Pod locked. Please step back. Why the tubes? The cryo tubes help take the body's care temperature down, pulling the body into nearly a frozen stale, to keep the mind the target, switched off. Operation Alpha 773 Tango in progress. And this is a live operation? We wired it out on his ear when we detained him for questioning. Configuration complete. Execute when ready. Executing. Subconscious transference activated. Vapor initiated. Interface initiated. Subconscious transference in progress. Upload complete. Operation complete. Six high ranking terrorist taken the fuck down. Zero American casualties. How do you safeguard the life of the soldier? Oh, there's some calculated risk. If the soldier doesn't SOAP back quick enough and the target dies we could conceivably lose an American soldier but our soldiers are so highly trained there'd be very few deaths. If they fail, of course we terminate the dormant consciousness in the soldier's body. We don't want these terrorist walking around in the highly capable body of American troops. No, we wouldn't. Sir, we've achieved in days what would've taken years and put numerous lives at risk. Norris, now I am impressed. And the world is a safer place already. Any time restrictions? A long ratio. And this has been tested? We have living proof. By sabotaging your research. I'm a man of science. I do not believe in God. But I've been having dreams. Dreams of people I've never met, places I've never been. I'm seeing his memories. We're not gonna die today, soldier. Do you hear me? Tell me, how was that possible? So the only thing left to say is just don't fuck this up. We've already spent enough money on this. What do you think? Your board approved, Morgan. We are in business. That my friend is a piece of cake. Bravo. This wasn't supposed to be possible. The consciousness of the host is supposed to completely disappear. We spit in Mother Nature's eye and she's fighting back. If takes one hour for the bots to fully interface the subject's brain. I mean, we don't have a lot of time before your wiring is complete. And than you're in the SOAP system permanently. They can do whatever they want with you. Viewing your visual memories, tracking your locations. Once they located the drive you and your wife are both dead. Trust me, you don't wanna end up like Jack Simon. Guard! Help me hold him down while I check his vitals, please. Detective Ross. Have you seen Mitch? I haven't heard from him. I'm scared. I woke up and I can't remember big chunks of time. And the last thing I remember is giving blood at the hospital with Katie. I'm really worried about Mitch. It's okay, Angie. Stay where you are. We'll find Mitch. Just take care of Katie. I'll send some units over to keep an eye at the hospital and I'll call you as soon as we hear anything. Senator Jones was trying to shut down the program. Norris wasn't gonna let that happen. What the hell is this? A new way of warfare. Norris has created his awn kill list, which includes high ranking US officials like Senator Jones. He's going to use you like he used Jack Simon. Son of a bitch. Shut it down. It's not that simple. There's gotta be a kill switch. We're here. Lower deck 5. The only way to shut down the program is by directly tapping in to the mainframe on level 2. If requires several biometric scans to get access. You'd be dead before you ever get to the door. I'd be dead. But you could walk right in. You're gonna show me how to shut this thing down. Oh shit. Oh shit. Location triangulated. Coordinates being sent to your personal comms unit. Welcome back, Dr. Downey. Detective Ross. I did it. Mitch. I snapped. What? I killed him. I know there's a lot stuff going on but just talk about this. I'll come get you. Where are you? Mitch, just slow down, buddy. Slow down. Do what you do. Trace that call. It's Mitch. Trace that call. Shit. Hey there. All right, everyone just, no one knocks anymore. You just walk in the door. Dc you know why I'm here? I ordered pizza about an hour ago. You don't look anything like a pizza delivery guy, sol have no idea why you're here. Why are you here? Hand over the drive. Drive? I'm not sure what you're talking, drive. I mean I can probably help you with some sort of drive but... I'm not gonna ask you again, boy. Where's the goddamn drive? Oh, the thumbdrive? Come on. You shoulda said the thumbdrive. I would've known what you was talking about. Why did you say drive? That can mean many different things. Thumbdrive. There's no need to be pointing guns in here that's freaking crazy. If that's what you wanted you can have it. He gave it to me. I don't even want it. It's yours. Take it. Just take the fucking thing. There's your drive. Security breach detected in level 7. - Alert. - Came on this way. Unauthorized live weapons discharged on level 7. Come on. Come on out. Where are you? I just want the drive. How much time do I have left? Two minutes. Now this building is owned by BlackSun Weapons & Technology. We come in through the main gale. There's three floors that go down. We don't know what the hell is going on in there... I need to talk to Detective Mitch. Hands. Show me your hands. Show me your hands! Slow. He had me working on this. If got some crazy shit on it. I just want to return it to him. What do you gotta go do with Walker? He's a suspect. Mitch is a suspect? Look, he hasn't done anything. I've got the evidence on this drive. It's got some assassinations and some crazy, freakin' weapons. He's innocent. I don't want anything to do with it. Give me that. - I haven't seen anything. - Give me that. I don't wanna... All right, come with me. Come on! Shut it down! Welcome hack, Dr. Downey. Access denied. It's locked. If won't let me access system shut dawn. Move! No, no, no, no. I'm going this one. Move. Warning. Server disruption. System shutdown imminent. Good evening ladies and gentlemen, friends, colleagues, fellow soldiers. I like to introduce the man of the hour, Mr. Kyle Norris. Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. What a vision. Nothing quite makes me feel this good as seeing much of free Americans at ease. Enjoying themselves with no fear of some raghead attacking them, kidnapping them or killing them like they did my sun who died which brings me to a subject that I'd like to share with you if you allow me a moment I'll just take a brief amount of your time if you just put down your champagne glasses and forks and I'll be very brief. Ladies and gentlemen, you know we're free because we fought for it. With the SOAP program we can be anyone, anywhere at anytime. Warning. System unstable. System shutdown imminent. You just activated the shut down. Good. No, not good. Without a proper system shut down it'll zap the entire mainframe which will make this system unstable but it won't destroy it. It's over. Norris is too powerful. We're not gonna get outta here alive. No, no, no. The system is too unstable. Best case scenario, you're stuck in Norris' body. Worse case, you both die. I don't have a choice. Warning. System unstable. Emergency systems operational. Pod 3 ready to initiate SOAP. Pod locked. Please step back. 60 seconds to subconscious transference. Interfacing initialed. Subconscious transference initiated. Vapor initiated. Subconscious transference in progress. SOAP in progress. I have a confession to make. I'm responsible for the deaths of Senator Jones and several other high ranking government officials. This program is no good. It's no good for you, for me, for our children, or our country. This is dangerous technology in the hands of some men who purport to be patriots but are very dangerous men that should not be allowed to exist. Just think about it now. A kid who never fire a gun in his life, $300 to his name, purchases an assault rifle and shoots up a school with a precision of a trained sniper killing dozens of young children, and he does it on the eve of a crucial vote on gun control.
