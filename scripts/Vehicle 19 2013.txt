No, no, there was this mechanical issue with the plane, and we were delayed, and then customs, it just... it took forever. This is hard, Michael. There's history. You know I want this to work. It's just you coming. I don't know. Angie, just listen to me. I'm here, okay? And it's gonna be different this time, I promise. I want to believe that. You know, I really do. Just please don't let me down again, okay? I'll be waiting. Okay. I'll see you in 20 minutes. Okay. Hertz Rental, Sandy speaking. How may I help you? Yeah, this is Michael Woods. I was just in there a moment ago. Oh, yes, the American. Mm-hmm. Is everything okay, Mr. Woods? No, actually, uh this is a minivan. I ordered a sedan. Um, well, why don't you just come back on in, and we'll see if we can't find out what the problem is. I'm sure my manager will be back any time. You can't sort this out? No, sir. I'm afraid I'm not that good with a computer, but my manager will be back anytime soon now. You know what? This is gonna be fine. No, no, no, sir. Yeah. I'm sorry to say... Unfortunately, I'm running late. Somebody's waiting for me, and we'll just sort it out when I come back, all right? No, sir. I'm afraid you don't understand... Thank you. Bye. This is weird. What? They drive on the left. Hey! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man! Better wake up! Stay out of trouble, Michael. Stay out of trouble. Stay out of trouble, stay out of trouble. Hey. Where are you? I'm... I'm stuck in a traffic jam. There must be an accident or something, and then I ran into an issue with the rental car company, too. Michael, you know what security is like here. Just to get this little bit of time, I have to go through a whole procedure. No, I know, I know, but, I mean, it's not my fault. What am I supposed to do? I can't control the air flow or the traffic. I mean, can't you just wait for a little bit? I've been waiting for 18 months. I know. All right, and I'm here now. When the parole board approved your travel, I thought this could be like a new start for us, but now I'm scared that... What? Wait, why are you crying? No more stories, Michael. I can't get hurt again. What... I can't. What stories? Did you stop at the liquor store? No, come on, I told you. I'm stuck in a traffic jam. Okay. Angie, just give me this one chance, all right? I promise you I'm not gonna screw it up. Okay. Okay, call me when you get here. Hey, you'll get there, buddy! God. Hello, my friend. I'm selling chargers, my friend. Yeah, I don't need a charger. No, my friend. Take a charger, my friend No, I just bought one at the airport, though. Oh, come on, those are cheap. They break all the time, my friend. I don't need one. No, my friend. Look at me. I'm the cutest boy in town. Yeah, I'm sure you are. Which one do you use, my friend? Hey, hey, what are you do... Hey, what are you doing? They just stole my glasses. The big story on Eyewitness News today is the disappearance of the lead prosecutor in the case against the Chief of Police, Ben Rose. Rachel Shabangu has been missing for the past 24 hours, and her family and the NPA have been pointing fingers at those implicated in the case she was to provide evidence against. Alex, this is the third time that this kind of thing has happened in a case against the Chief of Police. Well, the prosecutors here, they've seen this sort of thing occurring on a regular basis. It seems like a blatant disregard for the law by the very people who are meant to uphold it. Hello? You were meant to acknowledge receipt of the message. Hello, who is this? Can you tell me what's going on here? Hello? How did you get this phone? Uh... it was in the glove box. I... I picked up this car from the rental car company. They screwed up the car and... Hello? Hello?! Why is this gun in my car?! Oh. To hell with this. I'm outta here. Hey. Hello, Michael. Yeah, I just thought you should know, I'm not playing your stupid game. I'm outta here. I left your van, your gun, your phone. Michael... You can have it all, buddy. My name is Detective Smith. We're in the middle of a covert operation at the airport. There was a mix-up. That car was meant to be picked up by one of our undercover police officers. We appreciate that this was just a random mistake and that you are an innocent party in this. That's good. That's good news. You're not to blame here. We know what happened. You have no idea. Yeah, well, sorry about that. We've got another car for you, so we'll send you the address, and we can swap it over, okay? Okay, great. That's a relief. I got to... Guess I'm not walking after all. Uh, Smuts Street, please. Which one? I have over 57 in the directory, sir. Uh, I don't know. I'm American. I'm not from here. Unfortunately, I cannot help unless you have more information. Goodbye. Excuse me. Excuse me. Could you tell me where Smuts Street is? Right. Uh-huh. Could have seen that one coming. Smuts. Smuts Street. Excuse me. Uh, it's all right. Never mind. Thank you. I got to turn around. Crap. What's going on? You're half an hour late. Yeah, I got... I got lost, and now I'm stuck. Where are you? I turned off, uh... Crane Street. Crane Street? What are you doing on Crane Street? There was a mess-up... There was a mess-up with the rental car, and this... The wrong car? I don't understand. Michael? Angie, do you love me? What? You heard me. Michael, what's going on? Because if you really love me, I need you to tell me how to get to Smuts Street, and then I need you to not ask me any more questions. And, please, just give me 20 more... 20 more minutes, and if I'm not there within 20 minutes, you don't ever have to talk to me again, okay? Go back. Go back on Crane, take a right on Gull, and then the third left at the light is Smuts. All right. All right, I love you. I'm not gonna hurt you. I swear to God. I'm gonna take this gag off, okay? Are you all right? Water. Water. Yeah. Can you untie me? Yeah. Oh, sh...! Are you crazy? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? They wouldn't have left this to some random guy, so don't play the innocent man. You just sit back, all right? I don't know what the hell you're talking about, and I don't really care. You just sit there, and you shut up. Just sit in your seat! Just stay there. This is crazy! Oh, God. I'm gone. Turn the car around. Turn the car around. I don't want to hear it. Listen to what I say, and you won't get hurt. Turn the car around. I don't have anything to do with this, all right? Not a thing. I don't have any involvement in this. You're driving too fast. Slow down. I said slow down! Enough! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What are you doing? Stay in the car! You stay in the car! You don't know what you're doing. Sit down! You just don't... Hello? You're late, Michael Woods. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. You got out of jail only 10 days ago. I checked your record. Already broken your parole condition by leaving the country, an ex-wife at the embassy. Is that where you're going? No, no, I'm on my way to you right now. Do you want to go back to jail, Mr. Woods? No. Five minutes, or we're coming for you. I'm coming. There's a woman... There's a woman tied up in the back. Hello? Ju... Just... Just stay in your seat, please! Just stay in your seat, all right? Just stay there. Don't move, nothing! Just stay there. You don't know what's going on, do you? I think I need to explain the situation you find yourself in. You're talking to the wrong person. My name is Rachel Shabangu. I work for the National Prosecuting Authority. I've recently uncovered information implicating a very powerful man named Ben Rose on various counts of international sex trafficking. The last thing I remember is going home, opening my front door, then waking up in this minivan with you. I have reason to believe I have been kidnapped to prevent this information from coming to light. You know, I don't want to hear any of this. All right? I don't want to hear any of it. You have to do the right thing. You know, just save it, all right? You just save it for the police. When we get there, you can tell them all about your story. Ben Rose is the Chief of Police. It's the police that want me dead. Look, I don't know how you got involved in this, but you are. No. This is my reality, and it's just become yours. No, it hasn't become my reality! You may not like it. This isn't my reality! Sometimes life doesn't give us a choice! I got to do what I got to do! You're in this situation for a reason! I just got to stay out of trouble right now! You just shut up! You have to do the right thing! No, I don't! You shut up! Don't you get it? You cannot cut this out! I can't think straight! Aah! You cannot... I guess this is right. Go! Go! Go! Why are they shooting at us? Just get the hell out of here! Go, go, go! I'm going, I'm going! Get back onto the main road! Go, go, go, go, go! I'm going! I'm going! Give me the gun. Give me the gun! These people are going to kill us! Give me the gun! Will you give me the gun? Faster! Shoot them! Shoot them! Go faster! Go! I'm going! I'm going. You have to go! Go! I'm going! Move! Okay. Hey, hey! When I say you get inside, you get inside, all right? What? When I say duck inside... What? you duck inside! There's a wall! I know! When I say duck inside, you get inside! Now! I know someone. Someone who can help. Where are we? It's a township. Just keep going further down. All right, turn right here. This is it. Wait here. Can you just talk to him? What's going on? We're gonna have to try someone else. There he is, there. Benji! Benji! Hey, Benji! Okay, go around. He's ignoring us. Go around. There. Benji! Benji. They kidnapped me. They tried to kill us. Benji... Benji! They threatened my son at his school. You know what I'm saying? At his school. He's only 8. Please leave me alone. They threatened his son. That means they're gonna go after my wife. She's at the embassy. Call her. Whatever happens, she must stay where she is. Hey, it's Angie. You know what to do. Angie, listen, I need you to stay put. I don't want you to move. I want you to stay right where you're at. There's some guys that... Listen, just stay where you are, all right? I'm on my way. I'm coming to get you right now. You can't go there. I have to go there. You can't. That's exactly where they're headed. These people are dangerous, and they will kill us. She's safe. They can't get her at the embassy. I don't care. I'm going. Give me the phone. What department at the embassy? Uh, Diplomatic, uh... Hey. It's on the phone. Look on the phone. It's gonna be okay. She's safe there as long as she stays inside. American Embassy. Yes, hi, can I have Diplomatic Affairs, please? Not a problem, ma'am. Who would you like to speak to? I'm looking for Angelica... Moore, Angelica Moore. Angelica Moore, please. I'm sorry. She just stepped out. How long ago? What? She just stepped out. There was someone to see her. Put on your seatbelt. It's only a block away off Nicol. It's red. It's red! It's just there. There! Those are his men! Wait, there she is! There she is! Get back inside! Angie! Michael! She got back in! She got back in! You've been shot? Where's... We got to get you to a hospital! No, no doctors. No hospitals. They'll find us. Turn... Turn here. Left here? Turn left. Go to that... that underground parking sign. There. There. Right there. We can't just stay down here. Okay, go down to the bottom level. Find a place out of sight, somewhere where they can't see us. Here. Okay. All right. I have to take this off. I need you... I need you... Help me get this off. I need to see the wound. All right. This is it. Stop it. All right. You're gonna... okay. You're gonna have to push harder. Just do it, push. I'm pushing. Push harder. I'm pushing. It's not stopping. Come on. I'm not gonna make it. There's too much blood. There's too much blood. It's not gonna happen. No, you're gonna be fine. It's not gonna happen. No, you're gonna be fine. No. Come on.

Yeah. Turn it on. All right, just tap that. Hit that button. Push it. Push it? Mm-hmm. My name is Rachel Shabangu. Today, October 12, 2011... I have been shot. In the event that I don't survive, this will serve as testimony for my prosecution. On September 17, 2011... I uncovered a sex trafficking ring out of Johannesburg... It's okay. and a tail that led back to Chief of Police... Ben Rose. When I re... realized how deep not only he, but other... other high-ranking officers were involved, I tried... I tried to contact Judge James Mzuka... but then found myself... Concludes... my testimony... witnessed by... Michael, Michael Woods. Michael... Woods. No, open your eyes. Open your eyes. Hey, open your eyes. I want you to stay with me, okay? I don't want this on my shoulders. You're gonna stay with me, so I want you just to breathe. Take it to... the courthouse. No, I'm not... To the courthouse. I'm not gonna deal with the police, okay? I'm not even supposed to be here. You're gonna stay with me. Find... Judge... Mzuka. He's the only one you can trust. No, I'm not... To the courthouse. You stay with me. Just stay... Just... He's the only one you can trust, no one else. No, I'm not trusting anybody. You understand? You're gonna stay right here, okay? You're gonna take it to the judge. You're gonna do this. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine, okay? You're gonna be fine. I want you to say it, just say it. It rests on you. No, this doesn't rest on me. This rests on you. This rests on you. Now, you say it. You say... It's up to you now. No, it's not on me. You st... You stay with me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. This is yours. This isn't on me. This isn't on me! God damn it! I can't do this! Hey, it's Angie. You know what to do. Give me your wallet. I said give me your wallet! Get out of here. Listen here, give me your wallet or I'll stick you, man. Hey! Hey! Are you deaf? Get out of here. This is your chance. Now go. We just picked up a call to 911 about a dead woman in a parking garage. Caller sounded distressed. You feeling any better now? So how much did our friend, Rachel Shabangu, tell you before she died? You killed her. Hey, hey, hey, easy there, big boy. Look, Michael, I'm not the one just out of jail for hit and run, okay? It was an accident, and I paid my dues. You don't know me. You do seem to have a bit of a knack at being in the wrong place at the wrong time, don't you, Mr. Woods? Anyway, here's the situation. You've broken your parole conditions, making you a wanted felon. You're alone in a city you've never been to before, whereas I, on the other hand, have access to the entire police force here. I know the car you're in. I know its color, its plates. I also have people waiting for your ex-wife to take one step out of that embassy. One step, and she's mine. So what are you gonna do? There is one more thing I thought might help you make the right choice here. Why don't you turn on your radio? ...and have released his picture and name to the media. American Michael Woods is wanted for the murder of National Prosecutor Rachel Shabangu... So let's say you make the enlightened choice here and just stay out of my way, okay? Cookie boy. What? That's what my father used to always call me, Cookie boy. Said I'd always crack under pressure. Said I'd always crumble like a cookie. He was a mean bastard. Tough life, huh? You know, that chuckle of yours, it reminds me of him, 'cause he had one just like it, a sadistic-ass chuckle. And, you know, even though he's dead, every time I screw up, I can still hear it. Are you a mean bastard, Detective Smith? Be very, very careful here. 'Cause you know what's more powerful than a mean bastard with too much power? You're playing with fire. A man with nothing to lose, Detective Smith. I will kill you. So you asked me to choose. Okay. I choose. I choose fuck you. ...sex trafficking ring... The Chief of Police... I tried to... Judge James Mzuka. James Mzuka. Judge James... Afrikom Information, how may I help you? Yeah, I need the phone number for Judge James Mzuka. Ah, here we go. Would you like me to connect you? Yes. Please hold. Hi, this is Judge James Mzuka. Hey. Please leave a message after the tone. My name is Michael Woods. I have Rachel Shabangu's recorded testimony. They killed her, and they tried to kill me. I'm coming in. I'm gonna bring it to the courthouse. Hey, it's Angie. You know what to do. Remember that night when you had on that yellow dress... the new one, and it was raining? And I was running around, trying to catch all the raindrops to keep you from getting wet? We were laughing so hard, our stomachs hurt. Yeah, you and me, we used to have some... some good times, Angie. Uh, these people... These people are gonna tell you things. I don't know exactly what they're gonna tell you, but I know they're gonna tell you that I killed somebody, but it's not true. And I'm gonna prove that to you. I'm gonna prove that to everybody, even if it kills me. I'm just trying to make up right now for every wrong turn I've ever made. I'm just trying to do the right thing, and right now, unfortunately, my only chance of getting back to you, my only chance of ever even seeing you again is to clear my name. This is the only way. Yeah, it's the only way, so just know that I'm sorry. I hope you understand, and... and I love you forever. You lost something? I need my car sprayed. You've got this look, doesn't quite fit your pretty face, huh? That's the look of a man on fire. Are you on fire, Mr. A-merican in a minivan? I don't have any money. You're right out there, huh? Just burning up. You see, when a man is on fire like you, usually everything seems perfectly clear. But you don't have clarity, huh? 'Cause you seem to have mistaken me for Mother Teresa. You know how much a can of spray costs? This is knock-off, man. You get this in a cereal box. That's all I got, man. I don't need a pro job, just change the color. Ride on back. All right, I gotta get out of here. Places to go, things to do. I get you, man. Now, boys, come on, wrap it up, huh? Man on a mission, got to go! Yeah, I got to go. Come on. Come on, boys! Come on! Hey, how do I get to the courthouse? Just off Diagonal, third right, you'll see the big steps. Thank you. Hello? Hello. Am I speaking with Michael Woods? You called me? Yeah, who is this? My name is Judge Mzuka. There was a message about Rachel. Yeah, yeah, I have her, uh... I have her testimony. She recorded it before she died. Listen, what you have in your possession is the best chance we're ever going to have of convicting him. It's the only chance we've got. I need that... Yeah. and I need it now. Yeah, I'm on my way to the courthouse right now. No, no, no, no, no, no. They'll kill you on sight. Well, they won't know, though, 'cause I had my van... I had the whole thing sprayed, and they won't be able to tell I got... You don't understand. There's a shoot on sight order out on you. There are police everywhere. The courthouse is the worst place you could possibly go. That's exactly where they're expecting you to go. I have to. That's suicide, Mr. Woods. I promised her. Look, I can come to you. Just tell me where you are. Talking on your cell phone and operating a vehicle is illegal. You do realize that. May I see your license, please? Can I see your license, sir? Sir, I need to see your license. Step out of the car, sir. Sir, step out of the car! You, stay put! What happened? Aw, just... It was a cop, but he's gone now. He left. Michael, listen to me. It's too dangerous. Do not go anywhere now. I'm going to send someone. Just tell me where you are. Um... Hello? Michael, can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, um... Where are you? I'm on, uh... I need to know where you are. Yeah, my phone battery's going dead. I'm on. This is, uh... Michael? Bertha Street. Yeah, Ber... Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Oh, God. Where is it? Come on!

This man is a fugitive from the law. Nobody is getting him anything. And who the hell are you? Detective Smith. This is a DT matter. I'll take it from here. I'll blow his head off! No, you won't. Yes, I will. Now, you get the judge, and you get him now, or this guy dies, I swear to God. This guy's gonna die if you don't get me the judge right now. Not gonna happen. Don't you push me. Don't you push me! Haven't you screwed up enough for one life, Mr. Woods? Right now, you're dead center in the crosshairs of at least two Class A snipers. I give the word, and you're dead.

Don't you say another word! Rachel Shabangu's testimony. He's got a bomb! No! No! No one fires! No one fires! No one fires! Step back! My name is Rachel Shabangu. Today... Cut the feed! October 12, 2011, I have been shot. In the event that I don't survive, this will serve as testimony. On September 17th... Cut that feed now! 2011, I uncovered a sex trafficking ring... out of Johannesburg... and a tail that led back to... Chief of Police... Ben Rose. Recovering in Johannesburg Central Hospital, the American tourist, Michael Woods, was praised as a hero by President Jacob Zuma, who called him "a courageous defender of justice. " At his bedside, his ex-wife Angelica Moore spoke with us earlier today. We've had difficult times, but somehow I always knew that he's got it in him. When it really mattered, he'd pull through, and I will always love him for that. Rose and several other high-ranking officers and members of court were arrested late last Tuesday after a dramatic showdown on Constitution Hill. Shabangu's testimony and the body of evidence found in Justice James Mzuka's possession ultimately led to... Woods, who violated parole in the United States by coming to South Africa, has been granted permission to return home for further treatment while his case will be reconsidered... A state funeral will be held Saturday for Rachel Shabangu, whose final words have been dominating the headlines in South Africa...
