No, just basically saying "What's up?" in several different ways. Uh-huh. What are you doing now? I have to go home and study. That's so lame. No, come over to my house, we'll watch a movie. We literally just watched a movie. Yeah, but studying... sucks. I know, I know, I got to. I'll call you later. All right... hey, where'd you park? So, let me drive you. It's 50 feet away. All right, fine. I love you. Bye. Love you. The devil had my... Oh the flower The delicate flower that breeds the bees that sting Help! Oh, fuck! Lady I get nervous Just a-being in your service Words are full of indecision They evince the troubled nimble wit Oh nothing in return But storm and pessimism 'stead of dreamin' Being good for me And just a-standing in your pretty prison You're standing here You think you love me Don't you Miss Hannaford, in a minute... I'm gonna ask you to take a look at the statement you gave us... and uh... sign it. Wait, the camera doesn't show anything? Well, the camera in the foyer there doesn't show the bulletin board. Can't you move it? I mean, how many more of these do I have to keep on finding? Well, then we'd be looking at the doors, which is why the store has the camera there. Someone made that image and sneaked it past cameras to post it up there... for anyone to see, for a kid to see... doesn't that make you feel like, I don't know, maybe it's not a good thing? It is a graphic depiction. It's not a crime, though. It's not a crime to make 'em, not a crime to show 'em. It's poor taste. The girl in the photographs, she's someone, isn't she? There's no way for me to look at this and even know if it's real. Unless we can link it to some kind of actual criminal activity... a body, or ID on a missing person. But this... No body, no crime. Wait, but this one's numbered. You saw that. It's numbered seven at the bottom. Well, it's probably some kind of a art thing... some kind of a numbered art thing, street art. What do they call it? Uh... Outsider Art. Yep. Okay, has anyone else seen these? Or are they just for me? Is that what's concerning you here? Yes, has anyone else turned them in? No. No, I don't think so. So, they're art, but just for me to see? So I would encourage you not to take this personally. Great. Do you know any photographers? No, I don't. Well, we got your statement, so I'm gonna ask you to take a look at it... and sign it... right there. There you go. How can I be the only guy who wants the police in Spearfish, South Dakota... to call the gruesome discoveries of the past several weeks the work of a serial killer? Who wants to give me a reason why the gruesome photograph... that was found stapled to a telephone pole... behind the local library isn't a photograph of the mutilated remains... of 23-year-old Savannah Simms... who was reported missing some ten days earlier from a not so neighboring town? The nature of the mutilation portrayed in the photograph... made a definitive identification impossible at this time... and so I'm asking, "Why can't it just be Savannah Simms, just this once?" And the photograph that was found pinned to the community bulletin board... at the local Wellborn Supermarket... can't it please be of 22-year-old Janet Teasley... Where do you want these new prints? Who was reported missing 75 days earlier from yet another not at all neighboring town? Can't Spearfish, just this once, have a serial killer to call our very own? I gotta see these pictures. They're like literally the only thing that's not on the internet. Who do I know who can make that happen? You read conversation-style blogs written by people from your hometown? I'm inspired by any nut that takes pictures of dead people and posts them online. I'm fucking inspired! I'm... I'm hard! I'm gonna be fully erect here in a minute. Oh, for a change. Hey! Hey! That was the mushrooms, we talked about that. Was it? This guy knows I'm from Spearfish. He's doing this photography thing with his victims as an homage, as a nod, a nod to me... Spearfish's most famous citizen and only known living artist. Frankly, I'm flattered. Didn't it say that there isn't a serial killer? These guys are always inspired by something, fucking copy cat. What I need is a cigarette. Chew the gum. Fuck the gum. The gum tastes like garlic semen. Yeah, I just feel bad for the girls. They're getting killed and then mutilated... and then put on display. It's fucking awful. Here we have a model who feels something for another model... because she's dead and mutilated and displayed like a piece of meat. This is news. Shut up, asshole. Huh? I said, "Shut... Don't smile. How about that? You like that? Best picture of the day, easy. What time is it? It's uh, 6:00. 6:00 in the evening, fuck me. Okay, you know what we gotta do? We're gonna call those... those perfume campaign people. What the fuck is that called? The Bay Campaign. The Bay Campaign. The Bay Campaign, thank you, the Bay Campaign. Stoner. Call the Bay Campaign people and wake them the fuck up and tell them... that I finally figured it out, and I know exactly what I'm going to do for them. I'm gonna steal this nut's idea. I'm gonna hire models pretending to be dead people. Actually not that much of a stretch. And you think the Bay people are gonna go for that? I told them not to hire me in the first place... but they insisted, so this is what they get. They get unidentifiable dead models. We'll use those kids from the last shoot, Trip and what's her name? What's her fucking name, this one? Uh, Victoria. Victoria, Trip and Victoria, dead eyes on both of them. And Rose here. Oh, yeah? Fuck me, huh? Yeah. Okay, only if you're lucky. All right now, somebody please, please, get me a fucking cigarette... before I kill somebody and take their fucking picture! Well, here you go. Door-to-door service and it's not even bright out yet. That's gotta be worth something. I told you last night that I didn't need you to drive me... and I told you again an hour ago. Yeah, well, maybe you don't want your picture in the newspaper. The story goes somewhere, but it's about time that my face went fucking national. Hey, come on. Look, I'm trying here. And who's that? Oh, nothing, it's just Jill. Jill, wh... Anyway, I gotta go. Thanks. Maybe I'll see... Yeah, well, that went great. Nice job with the minivan, by the way, that's nice. Yeah, sorry, they didn't have any Escalades left. So, we're gonna be dead in the pictures, right? Well, I want to have my eyes open. Can I have my eyes open? Like, it would look so cool if I was all like... You know? Okay, does my manager know about this? Because I think it's disgusting. I think it's brilliant. It's a commentary on our fascination with death. How we let ourselves... we think about death just as much as we think about sex. Well, if that's what it is, then it's awesome. I'll tell you what it is, kids. It's that every fucker in the country thinks they're a photographer now, okay? And everyone can share an image, and it's awful. It's awful, because it makes everything just like watery piss. Then you have this guy who creates an image that you actually can't fuck with. That you actually can't ignore, and when that happens, I have to ask myself... "Peter Hemmings, what is wrong with this picture? "Are you just going to sit there and let this guy make you look like a dummy... "or are you going to steal his idea and make a bunch of money, and then get high?" And I think we all know the answer to that, don't we, Trip? Oh, hells yeah, man! If I catch any of you Instagramming... or whatever the fuck it's called on this trip, you're all fired. I couldn't be more serious. Yeah, he's not kidding. Let's have a party tonight. Yeah, man! Just a little get together, you know, invite some locals... barbeque some shit, some ribs, sprinkle a little peyote on there. Just a little get together, just to celebrate our arrival. Cool, we'll just have to stop in town, grab some stuff. My house has definitely got nothing. Hey, how much longer? I have no fucking idea. It's been so long, I don't even recognize these trees. Hey... check it out. Jesus. 10,494... I've had anal sex with more people than that. Get the fuck off me! Jesus, I'm driving. Keep fucking driving, then. Devil's in a foul mood I know Stakin' out the ground now Here we go She's got no head on Somewhere lost Ran out in the back woods I know Take a look at yourself Oh no She's a fool for A fool for you Yeah, it still smells like a wet sponge. Oh... I think this was where one of the pictures were found. Note to Chris, call the cops and make an appointment for me to see those pictures. An appointment? Note to Chris 2... get me a carton of cigarettes, a whole pallet. I've gotta piss. That's pretty. I want to photograph this truck. Look at the color, it's blood red. It's so spot-on that it becomes a complete clich... and it's such a clich that it comes right back around to being perfect for me. Whoa, that's heavy, man. Get it for me, Chris... pretty please? Get this truck for me. Okay, I'll leave a note. Capital idea. Ladies, why don't you just sort of come over here and stand... kind of lean maybe, on the... on the hood. Ready? I don't know if we should be leaning on the truck, guys. Chris, unclench, unclench. I know it's not... I love it. Here. I share no blame with you for the faults you made Those were different times Okay, the only thing you really need to know about me... is that tequila makes me want to fight... and cheap wine makes me want to fuck. I'm sure the lives of many brave young men were lost... in the refinement of that elegant theorem. I love you. Oh. Find everything you were looking for today? Uh, yeah, yeah, we did. Thank you. You remember all the numbers... for the codes and stuff? Oh, yeah, the scanner's been broken long enough, so... kind of have to. Oh, yeah... Makes it really hard to fall asleep sometimes. Can't really stop it. Yeah, I actually just read in the New Yorker... it's called the Tetris Effect. It's when you do something over and over again, it kind of gets stuck in there. You can't shut it off, you know? Hm, you know, I had a real Tetris problem in the 7th grade. It was really, really bad. Yeah, I did... I did, too, actually. I think everyone did, it's kind of... it's a good game. It's... Tetris. So, are you guys from Minneapolis? Uh, no, LA, actually, Los Angeles. What happened? Did your plane crash? Yeah, we were gonna resort to cannibalism... and then we found this place, so we didn't have to do that. No, we're here for a photo shoot. It's actually an ad campaign. It's... Peter Hemmings is shooting it. I'm sure you've heard of him. I haven't. I'm surprised. I thought everyone from here knew him. He's also from here. Is it that man over there staring at me? Is that him? Yeah. It's very much my boss. How's it going? Good, fine. Yeah? Yeah. Hello. I was pretending not to see you there. We're just sort of doing an expos on the local scene down here. You know, sort of kicking around some rocks and seeing what scatters. Expos is a French word for naked, by the way. It's okay, I get it. Just because you're from here doesn't mean that you're a local. Tell her I want to take her picture, Chris. Actually, tell her that we're having people over at this house that we're staying at. And tell her everyone knows it is the Cabin on the Lake Road. But tell her it's actually more like a house. You'll make it sound cute. Okay. Tell her she can bring whoever. She'll understand that you mean her boyfriend, just so it seems like you're cool with that. Yeah, I'll tell her all those things, yeah. Tell her she's beautiful. Give her a card. Okay, well... You obviously heard the man, uh... Yeah, I did. So anything else today? No, that will do it, thank you. All right, that brings your total to $328 and 71 cents. Put it on there, please. Are you guys seriously gonna drink all this? Hell's yeah, man. There's my kitty. Hello? Here, kitty, kit... That's not very nice. I see why you're Colleen's friend, you're very pretty. And I brought you a gift. No! It's okay. Got dinner! It's okay... ssh. Mm. Smells delicious. Eat up, pussy. That's not a very good kitty... is it? It's okay. Come on, it's... Come on. Look what else I got. Now I bet you were always the girl that never took a bad picture, huh? Yeah, I bet that was you. Should we call someone? Do you want your phone? You can call someone. Who do we have here? Colleen. She's probably busy at work. There's Kelly, there's... Mom. I'll let you call Mom. Mom's always know what to do. You call Mom and all this will be over, yeah? All right, let's call Mommy. Here you go. Go on, take it. Hello, you've reached Maryanne O'Meara... Please leave a message after the beep. Mom, come get me out! Mom! Mom! Hey, it's Jill, still stuck in hell. You know what to do. Hey, it's me. I just wanted to call and see where you are. I don't think I missed a call from you today... but... blah... anyway, call me back. This is like the Playboy Mansion. Well, that's what happens when you cast in a grocery store in fucking South Dakota. And there were obviously no dudes at the store. All girls? You couldn't have one sausage for Momma? Are you gonna take pictures of all these girls? Unfortunately. They're terrible. I understand. Why couldn't the killer have just killed one of them? Keepin' me up at night All night dreaming I'd fucking best let Johnny fuck that snake. If it was necessary, why not? What the fuck is he talking about? You know, bring it on. Yeah, I know, dickhead, squeeze and wad and shit. But if you think about it, it's like they don't even have any fucking arms! The sad part is he's gonna get laid. I hope so. What's up? I got a girlfriend She says she loves me Great. Okay, come here. Here you go. Just stand right there, and you come and stand right here. You... no, no, you. Okay. I'm just waiting, um, you know, for that moment... where things go from being completely fucking awful, like now... to coming back around to being really good. So it shouldn't be that much longer. And one, two... look at me. Very good, get closer. Jesus, are you guys in junior high? What am I doing here? Get closer to each other, come on. Closer, closer, closer, closer. Get inside of each other, go ahead. Fucking yeah, yeah. Great. My god, okay. Switch passing thumbs. If it's any more local girls, just tell them we're sold out. You guys want some chips? Hey, models don't eat... ever. That was so mean, do it again. Hi. Hey. Wow, you actually made it, um... Yeah, is... did I show up too late? No, no, not at all, it's awesome that you came. Come in. I'm sorry I'm late. I was supposed to meet a friend here and I guess she's still at work. No, that's fine. Here, come on, we're in here. This is so much better when you look away. I mean it. Petty resentments of the local girl. Oh, wow, it looks so appealing, all the drinks that no one's bothered to consume yet. Yeah. Actually... there might be something to it. What are you talking about? Yeah, I don't know, I don't even know what I'm really doing here. Hey, pretty lady. I'm so sorry, should I perhaps ask for permission... to take your photograph? Permission is such a shit word, there's nothing sexy about it. You know, in my line of work, we don't ask for permission. Nobody talks to each other about permission. What we talk about is release, that's what we give each other. Colleen... Peter. Yeah, I remember. Whoa! Okay, all right. Didn't that feel so much better? Okay, there you go. It's the release, isn't it? It just feels like you can get all of that tightness... that's inside of you and just let it go. Whoa. Oh, whoa? Yeah, whoa, I don't really like my photo being taken. Wh... wh... I don't like my photo being taken? Why not? What if I wanted to capture a photograph of you? You're being incredibly selfish, don't you think? I think you should just give her a second. I'm so sorry, you're right. I should at least wait until you have a drink inside of you... shouldn't I? Yes. Okay, please stop. And if you touch the head like that, you're just gonna make it come. Come on, baby, just release! Just back the fuck up! Oh! What the fuck, bitch? No, no, no, no. Easy for a second... you okay? Colleen, wait up! Hey, Colleen! Are you okay? Yeah, it takes a whole lot more than that to make me not okay. Yeah, um, Peter, he's... he's kind of a... Yeah, I know he is. Yeah. Well, if you come back in, I'll... I could talk to him. Yeah, I have work tomorrow and I don't know where my friend is... who was supposed to meet me here, so... Okay, well, I'm sorry. You're sorry? For what? Um, I'm sorry... I'm sorry for Peter. It's kind of my job to be sorry for him. Well, he's Peter Hemmings or whoever... so I'm sure he doesn't travel anywhere without his trusty team of apologists. Right. Yeah, I know, not your fault. Yeah, um, you get service out here? No, I don't. Yeah, shit, me neither, fucking AT&T. Hey, uh, I hate to tell you this.. But what you did in there is just gonna... it's just gonna make him like you more. Yeah, but it was totally worth it. Yeah. Are you cold? Mm... yeah, a little. Hey, uh, excuse me, can we get one of those cot blanket things? Having seen some movies, I'm pretty sure the guy didn't leave any fingerprints... unless he wanted you to find them, in which case it becomes this whole labyrinth-themed... thing and I'm really not sure you're ready for that, Officer. Well, we have to do everybody... just in case, just so we can tell theirs from yours. Oh, yeah, I get it. I mean, you know, you might want to just check her prints... since she's the one who touches her own car. Oh, we already have hers in the file. You know, from when she found the other photos? She found the other pictures that the guy left. Of course! Hey, it's cool, man. I'm not gonna throw you under the bus, Deputy. I understand that you're upset. I can see that. But from where I'm looking at things, nothing happened. And you're okay. Somebody followed me here... so he could put that picture in a place where I would be the one to find it. And we are gonna look into that. I know this is scary, and we're doing the best we can to figure this out. And until that happens, I'll have Daniels escort you home and follow you in his cruiser. Don't even bother. Colleen, hey! Are you sure you're gonna be all right? Haven't you heard? I'll be fine. Oh, shit. You know, I called you a bunch of times. You guys have fun, you and Jill? I'm tired, okay? You're all tired out, because it's special shit all of a sudden? Pretty townie chick, out and about. I don't want to do this tonight. Yeah, what, 'cause you already did some of that LA fag? What? What? What are you gonna make him your star? Wait, did you talk to Jill tonight? Jill? No, why the fuck would I want to talk to Jill, what, so she can lie to me, too? How did you know where I was? How do I know that you fucking lied to me? And went solo to a party? What the fuck is wrong with you? Did you follow me? What are you talking about? Did you put those pictures in places where I could find them? Pictures? Is that what you're going on about again, those fucking pictures? Yes! The one at the store, and the library, and tonight! Did you? Don't be fucking stupid. How did you know where I was? Colleen? Just say it was you, so I can do something about it! Beth Randle fucking texted me when you got there, all right? What is wrong with you? Just... You know, you think everything's about you, don't you? But it's not. See, I see you, Colleen. No, you don't. Now I need you to leave. What the fuck? Finally. Ben? You forgot your wallet, asshole. Ah, smells like you're smoking. We've moved past that, Chris. We've fucking moved on to bigger things. This girl has found all of the photographs so far. As far as I can tell, any time this guy wants somebody to find the photos, she does. Coincidence? I don't think so. Yeah, well that seems pretty obvious, yeah? So why her? I mean, if I'm the cops... that's what I'm doing, right? Yeah, I don't think that they're doing anything. It's that whole Dr. Lecter thing, and what do we covet? We covet what we see every day. Yeah, well, she's the check-out girl. Everyone sees her every day. But somebody sees her differently than everybody else. To somebody... she's a star. If I'm the police, that's what I'm doing. But fuck the police! I'm not the police! I'm a fucking artist! And it's a very fine line that separates me from our sick-fuck friend. He probably has a PC. Maybe I'm the one who's becoming obsolete. Maybe I'm the PC in this relationship. Maybe this guy... is a Mac. I don't want any other girls, I want this girl. I don't want anyone else. For what? For the big campaign, just her. Well, what about the whole "dead models" thing? It's been done. We take Colleen out of this shithole... and shoot her at the studio in LA, that's it. Why the fuck are we here? Use Rose or Vic, why does it absolutely have to be Colleen? So that he can't have her. Nobody makes me feel obsolete. Nobody makes me feel like a fucking Dell computer... and gets away with it. I want this girl. And by the way, you do, too. So get in line. It's just something I have to do. I can't stay in this town, it's a lot of stuff. Well, you certainly were a bright spot. Not here long enough for us to get to know you, Colleen... but a bright spot all the same, everybody sure likes you a lot. You know where you're goin'? Not like I haven't figured it out before. All right, your total will be $14.93. How's it going, Colleen? Oh, good, you know, slow. It's Tom. Yeah, I know, sorry, I can't seem to really wake up today. Long night? No, not really. Oh, thank you, let me help you there with that. Thank you. Have a nice day! Got any big plans for the weekend? Uh, probably, I'll just sleep. That's not much fun. Yeah, you're right about that. Prettiest girl in town... just goin' through a day until it's all over? It seems like a terrible waste, if you want to ask me. Hey, it's none of my business. You know, I'm not really supposed to say this... but you can buy a whole case of these things at Big Lots. Costs about half as much. You know, the truth is I'm not sure my cat's gonna live much longer, so I'd hate to waste it. Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that. Anything else today? No, that's it for me. All right, your total will be $1.09. Cool... and let me give you a penny. There you go. I'll be seeing you next time, Colleen. Hey. Hey. Ah, you think that we could talk for a second? You know, she sometimes does her hair up like that? It drives me fucking crazy. Do you really think this is a good idea? No, we can leave her here to die... Hey, so, Chris here thinks that I should apologize... for taking your picture... or something, I don't... I was only pretending to pay attention. Why? Because even when I'm a complete shit... I am still a much better option. You stay here and god only knows how many times... that guy tries to show you his nasty, nasty pictures. That's the best case scenario. The worst case scenario... is that you end up in one of those nasty, nasty pictures. Or you come out to LA with me... and make dirty pictures for me for a little walking-around money. You don't have to sleep with me. You can if you want to, but it's not a requirement. I don't give a shit. You can stay in my guest house. I've never even seen inside the place. It's actually... it's pretty nice in there. Well, yeah, shit! Look, I'm just trying to help you, okay? It's not like the guy is going to follow you back to LA, all right? That would be like a shark eating a bunch of people... and then getting on a plane, and getting off at the other end of the country... and then eating more people. I mean, serial killers don't board airplanes, they don't go on trips. Serial killers don't have wallets. No one's saying that there's... That there's what, a serial killer? What should I call this person? A man with a plan? A very dedicated individual? Why me? Does it matter? Yes, it does! Will somebody please explain to me why it's such a goddamn chore to be chosen? You think this is some sort of joke, don't you? It's not so great to be noticed, you know? It's one thing to be picked out by some fancy photographer... but what if it's just some random stranger... some guy on the street? That sort of thing doesn't end very well. I heard... but you know, this... This doesn't end very well, either. You still haven't answered my question. I chose you... because I haven't had a fresh idea... in a long, long time. Because I feel old... and tired. And you are neither. Honestly, I've never heard him say anything like that, ever. Fine. When? When? Tonight, now. Tonight we have a slumber party. A safety-in-numbers slumber party. And tomorrow, we get on the first flight we can back to LA. I mean, you weren't really planning on living here, were you? Someone has to come with me to my place, so I can get some stuff. Chris volunteers his services. Yeah. Watch out for Chris here. Scientology turned him straight. So I'm just... I'm curious... what made you say "yes" back there? 'Cause I'm pretty sure I can handle myself. Okay, good, he's not here. Who? Um, my boyfriend. Oh... cool, yeah. My ex-boyfriend. Okay, cool. Hey, can you do me a big favor? If you see a black truck, just make sure you honk twice. A black truck? Am I on like the lookout here, or I mean, is it... Really? Yeah. Is he big? Yeah, he's pretty big, but don't worry, he's a fucking pussy. Anyway, I'll just be two seconds. All right, I'll just... Don't worry. I'll just hang out here. A black truck... shit. But I've made it such a long long time Last night when you came home with someone in your view And you know I've made it for a long long time And you know that I have waited such a long long time And you know it that I've waited for a long long time And you know it that I've waited such a long long time How's Colleen? You know, you could have treated her like a star. Fuck you! The thing is, I can't really understand what you're saying. Your mouth just sounds like a dirty cunt. Should we ask Gerry what he thinks about you? Pussy! Do you like what you see, faggot? I'll fucking kill you. No... I don't think you will. In an hour, your body is gonna be in two separate trash bags. You should have treated her better. Fuck you. What? I don't know, you, you're angrily packing... like the girl in a movie who is angrily packing... because she's leaving the guy. But in reality, we all leaving at the same time... and we're all going to the same place, and I think that's incredibly funny. What's wrong? You know exactly what's wrong. Okay, remind me. You like that white trash bitch better than you like me... and it is fucking dumb. Colleen? Yeah. I haven't even tried her, yet. Jesus fucking Christ, Peter! Can't you be serious with me for one goddamn second? One! Hey, come here. No. Come here, eh! No, fuck you. Come on, come here! I'm sorry, okay? Come here. Come sit with me. Come here. Come on. Where are you gonna go? You're not gonna go anywhere. Come here. There you go! Come on. Don't fucking patronize me. You know what that word means, sweetie? Fuckin... Come here. There you go. I hate you sometimes. I hate you so much some times, too. I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, you're right. I do like her more than you. Motherfucker! Ow! Huh? I sat on something hard, hang on. Do you need me to get up? No, no, no, stay right there. Okay. Ow, what is this? Oh, look... it's a very, very, cheap bottle of wine. And how the fuck did that get there? A little birdie told me that when you drink cheap wine... it makes you want to fuck. See? Mm. When you talk, I listen. Aren't you so fucking sweet. Telling stories that no one believes To the trees Secrets of witches and thieves Whoa! This place is really nice. Yeah, yeah, I found it online. It's just a rental, but yeah, it's definitely really nice. You know, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna sleep on the couch downstairs. It's... it's okay, it's just for tonight. No, it's... it's fine. Uh, yeah, yeah, totally, um... Let me just get this crap out of the way. All right. Hey. Hello. Yeah. Yeah... almost. Are you okay? There, could you just roll some more? Where? This... this way? Yeah. Mm-hm. All right? Good now. Okay, then good, yeah? Yeah, oh yeah, baby, just like that! Jesus, I look pissed. Well, weren't you pissed? Yes... I guess the camera never lies. Yeah, actually it always lies. Once you take a photo of something, it's no longer the truth... it's just kind of like a version of the truth... which is basically like saying it's a lie. I drive far away I bet you say that to all the girls. Did it work? No. Okay. So, you like what you see? Oh, you look amazing. Mm, oh... I know. So don't ask me to... Mm. I shouldn't even be showing you these. Peter never lets anyone see an unedited batch... especially not the model. Is that what I am now? Uh, well, if you're gonna get paid to have Peter Hemmings take your photo... then yeah, people are gonna start to call you that. It could be worse. Okay, I guess I just don't like the idea of living off of my... Your looks? Yeah. I guess that any girl who thinks it's enough to be pretty is... Yeah, I don't know what you would call that. I'm pretty sure it's called a model. I think. Yeah. Yeah. A model, Jesus... Well, what else do you want to do? Nothing, never mind. That's a whole different conversation for some other time. So, am I gonna get to talk to you another time? I got time. Whoa! Who's... who's Kelly? Uh, Kelly's a... she's just a friend. She must be a really good friend, she has her own album thing. Uh, yeah, she does, doesn't she? Um, last time I checked, she changed her relationship status, so... Okay, I get it, that makes it official. I'm single now. Oh, yeah! Fuck me! Fuck me like a puppy! Oh! Mm! Yes, yes! Deeper, harder, harder! They uh... Uh... Yeah, I'm gonna shut the door. I don't think we should listen to that. It's fine, we're both adults, right? Yeah, yeah, totally, um... I'm still gonna shut it, though. That's the spirit! Fuckin' dumb-dumbs. Did she just say, "Fuck me like a walrus?" I knew that girl had body issues. You want some? No, it's the fucking local shit, it's horrible. Whatever. Let's go drown in the hot tub. Right now? Yeah. No! Do not bring your fucking camera! Hey, hey? What are you doing? Uh... No, come on, it's hot tub time. All right. Yeah. Okay? It's the hot tub time. You sound like a duck who got run over. Actually you sound like a grandfather clock jerking off. Oh, well, you look like a grandfather when you jerk off. Fucking perfect. Yeah. Wait, don't you need to use a flash? Hey, I'm the professional, all right? Okay... right. The fucking flash here. Did it go off? Turn around a little bit. Oh, yeah. Yeah, stay like that. Come on, show me your pussy. Okay, can you stop? One more. What are you doing? Peter! Where are you? Are you coming in? Hey! There you are. Hey. Where'd you... hey! Jesus, man! Peter! Knock it off! Hey! You're hurting my eyes, Peter. Jesus! I just wanted to spend one night, one night like a regular couple. Peter! Peter? Don't even tell me you have service, because I'll lose my shit. No, I have nothing, but I have to make a call. Okay, there's a landline in the kitchen, if it doesn't work. Thanks. Yeah. Hey, it's Jill, still stuck in hell, you know what to do. Hey, it's me! Again, I don't know where you are, or if you're okay... or maybe just in one of your funks, but I wanted to... I don't know how to say this, but, um, I wanted to talk... because well, it's too long to leave on a message... but I was thinking of taking off... leaving town. Anyway, uh, text me, call me... um, and don't be weird. Okay, bye. Yeah, baby! All night long, huh? One minute at a time. You need any more? I got more. Just give me five minutes. That's doubtful. Okay? Just five minutes. Yeah. You asshole. So, you like what you see? You look amazing. Oh, I know. So don't ask me that? Yeah, yeah. Hate me! Oh, fuck! Come on, come on! Oh, yeah! Yes! One is... no, no, you can't fucking play that. Hey. Yeah, I don't... I don't know. It's... I don't... Okay, so I know this might sound lame, but I think I might go to bed. Is that lame? No, no, it's not lame at all. I mean, you can stay up or whatever. Yeah, is it cool, will the computer screen keep you up? No, not at all, it's cool. I can go downst... I don't mind, I can finish up and... Yeah, I'm gonna go downstairs. Oh, okay, you don't have to, I can just turn over to the other side. It's fine, I'll just um... Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, so you can just chill and get some sleep. And it's totally fine, um... sleep well. Thanks for showing me those pictures. Yeah, of course, they're great pictures. All right, you sure you're gonna be cool? Yeah. All right, let me know if you need anything, I'll be down there. Goodnight. All right, goodnight. Hey, Peter! Peter! Rose! Rose! Hey! Rose! What the fuck? Agh! Peter! Colleen! Peter! Trip? Guys! This isn't funny! Not yet, Colleen. - Fuck. - Victoria? You weren't really thinking about leaving, were you? Nobody ever leaves. This is your big moment. Oh. It's okay. Colleen, it's okay. Colleen, Colleen, it's okay. Colleen? It's me... it's Tom. Colleen? Colleen? Colleen, can you look at me? Wow, you look real good, Colleen. We want to try one, but with your... your hair up. No! Don't kill me, please! No! Agh! No!
