He cried out, "The gods of the lightning are angry, and I must kill my fellow man to appease them!" As man grew older, he created shelters against the wind and the rain and made harmless the force of the lightning. But within man himself were elements strong as the wind and terrible as the lightning, and he denied the existence of these elements because he dared not face them. The tale we are about to tell is of the mortal storm in which man finds himself today. Again he is crying, "I must kill my fellow man!" Our story asks, how soon will man find wisdom in his heart and build a lasting shelter against his ignorant fears? Good morning! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, good morning, you don't have to tell me what day this is... the Herr Professor's birthday. Look at all the mail, twice as much as last year. My goodness, yes, and this just the beginning. Ja. Oh, give him my best respects, will you? I will, Hermann, I wll. Good morning, good morning. It's the post, Frau Professor... just look. There must be 50 letters. I'll take them, Marta. And the packages. More than last year. And the telegrams have been coming all day long. I tell you, I'm so excited. Are all the children down, Marta? All but Rudi. Oh, that child. I'll call him. And Hermann says to give the Professor his best respects. That's very kind. I'll tell him. Rudi? You'll be late, Dear. Half a minute, Mother. What was wrong with your breakfast, Viktor? Nothing, nothing. I enjoyed it very much. You haven't touched a thing. Come here this minute and sit down. Well, well, well, what do you think of that? Would you butter me a roll, please, Dear? What's all this? The mail. What, all for me? Uh-huh. Oh, thank you. You look very smart today. It's January 30. Do you recall anything that happened on that date? Well, I... I was born! Right. Good heavens, I'm 60! Many happy returns of the day, Darling. You love me still? Go on and eat your breakfast. If you hadn't stuffed me so, I might still have my youthful figure. You'll do. Oh? Good morning, boys. Good morning, Mother. See that your father eats his breakfast. I'm going to collect his notes. All right. Many happy returns, Father. Happy birthday, Father. A volume apiece. Well, thank you. Oh, Neumann's new book... just what I've been wanting. You've written in it. Where are my glasses? It's nothing... just "to our dear father, with affection." Nothing? That's... That's very much. You know, you boys have made me forget that, unfortunately, I'm only your stepfather. You've been a real father to us. And you've been just like my own children to me. Well, speaking of the angels... Good morning, Father. And a very happy birthday. Many happy returns. Thank you. They're peardrops, sir. They're awfully good. Oh, thank you. Will you have one? Don't mind if I do. I've got to go, Father, or I'll be late for school. I'll walk with you as far as the square. Good-bye, Father. Yes, good-bye, boys. See you later. No, thank you. What's that? For me? Don't be so impatient. Drink your coffee. I'll open it for you. Do you like it? Oh, that's wonderful! Let me put it on you. You look very beautiful and brainy. And I'm very, very proud of you. I'm overwhelmed. Viktor, you'll be late, Dear. Oh, yes. Your notes are in your inside pocket. Don't forget to take them to class. No, I won't. Good-bye. Good-bye. He hasn't eaten a thing. We must hurry. Marta, have you the Professor's rubbers? Yes, I have them here. Don't go without them, Dear. No, no, Dear. I won't, I won't. Good morning, Professor. Good morning, Professor. Ah, good morning, Lehman, good morning. Good morning, Herr Professor. It's a cold day. Yes, yes, it's cold, but it's sunny. I... I find it a very good day. You're not rheumatic? No, no, no, I feel pretty fit. For 60. Well, don't go into class in your wet rubbers. Uh... no, certainly not. You did last Friday. Yes, so you say, Lehman, so you say. The absent-minded professor... a character in fiction, my good friend. Uh-uh-uh-uh. What? And the other rubber? Good morning, Rector. Good morning, Professor. Good morning, Professor. Good morning, Professor. Well... It's a fine day, it's cold but sunny. I'm late. I had a little trouble getting away from home this morning. It must be past 9:00. 9:03, precisely. Well, carpe diem, I must go to work. It is the 30th of January, isn't it? January 30, yes. I thought so. Well... Professor? Yes? What's your hurry? Oh, no hurry. Though I would like to get through in good time today. And so would I. Well, you see, this is rather an occasion. It is? Well, you've picked a fine day for it. Yes. Well, I'll see you later. Silenzio! Silenzio! Pro candidato medicinae Fritz Marlberg. Et--et... Pro candidato medicinae veterinarae Martin Breitner. Herr Professor, we, your students, offer you our hearty congratulations on your anniversary. We appreciate the privilege of working under your guidance and we are proud of the honor that your accomplishments have won for our university and our Fatherland. Professor Roth, as a mere candidatus medicinae veterinarae... in plain language, horse doctor... I, uh... I, uh... Have not had the good fortune of attending your classes. I had a few notes here someplace, seem to have gotten away from me. Well, I... I got in on these doings because I have had the rare privilege of your friendship for the best part of my life. And I'm proud to offer you this... Uh, this little affair here in the name of your class. And I... I noticed that it says here it comes to you with the admiration and affection of your students. And that goes for every man and girl in this university. Well, here it is, sir. My dear young people, my colleagues, thank you. I...I have a confession to make. I thought that my anniversary had been forgotten, and, uh, I was trying to persuade myself that I didn't very much care. But I did... I was quite put out. So you will understand how deeply touched I am and how grateful for this expression of your affection that I reciprocate with all my heart. I thank you for your beautiful gift. It shows me, this splendid torchbearer, that you have understood what I have tried to impart. And that into your young hands will be given the torch of science when it has fallen from the hands of your masters. I sincerely pray that you will carry it worthily. I thank you, Fritz Marlberg, for your kind address, and you, Martin Breitner, for your very delightful presentation. But before I lay this flattering unction to my soul, I must ask myself whether your eagerness to do me homage might not have some slight connection with the fact that I have a not unattractive daughter. However that may be, I thank you both. I thank you all. Fritz! What are you doing out here? This. No, you mustn't... not now. I want to announce our engagement. You're crazy. We're too young. We're still in college. I know all the buts... and all the answers. No. I have to have time to think it over. I'll do all the thinking. Madame. Happy birthday, Father! 6 candles... one for each decade of a wonderful life. Thank you. Now blow them out and make a wish. Yes, blow hard... your wish won't come true unless you blow them all out at once. Every one of them. I have so much, and I should ask for more? It's been my privilege to let loose a little knowledge in this world, and for that I have been amply rewarded. I, uh... I think I've done rather well for myself in the choice of a life partner... Not that I had any say in the matter. My children are handsome and clever... Bravo! Bravo! And we are a very united family. In this home we've had the habit of gracious living. We've prided ourselves on our tolerance and our sense of humor. Good heavens, here I am making another speech! Well, I can think of may our happiness continue as long as we live. Sweet. A toast! A toast! To the health of our distinguished host. Prosit! Thank you, my dear. Professor, I hope you'll excuse me if I steal a little of your spotlight, but I have news. News? Mrs. Roth, Professor... it's no good tucking in my coat... Freya has promised to love, honor, and obey. Engaged! Oh! Really, please, I haven't made up my mind yet. I'll do that for you, Darling. Fritz, you're crazy. Put her in her place. You have our consent. Give in, Darling. I'll wait. Father, what do you think? That is a reasonable length of time. You know, you're rushing me right off my feet. Mother, what do you think? Shall I let him get away with it? Well, are you happy, Dear? Yes, I think so. Congratulations are in order. Freya. Congratulations! Thank you, Rudi! My boy! Professor. Herr Professor and Frau Professor... something wonderful has happened! We have just heard... they have made Adolf Hitler chancellor of Germany! Why, that's stupendous! If it's true. Is it official? It is true! It is official! It's coming in on all the stations! Let's find out! Let's get the radio. Adolf Hitler chancellor. And appointed by Hindenburg. What can he be thinking of? There it is. The news swept the capital like wildfire. The delirious frenzy of the people defies description! Thousands of men and women are gathered outside the chancellery. They've waited here for hours, hoping for a glimpse of our great leader, our new chancellor! Wait... the door of the chancellor's office is open! And coming out, our leader! He's addressed the people... he's stepping out to the balcony! Listen... listen the voice of a proud people acclaiming a man who will lead them back to power and glory! Well, he's done it! Things will happen now. What will happen now? We'll see a new Germany. I hope it's best for all, this change. Why, it means our country will be strong and powerful again, Frau Professor. Master of Europe and the world! Fritz, I've never seen you so enthusiastic. Freya, this is Germany's crying need... a strong man in a saddle. A leader who will fight for victory! Fritz is right. You can't put Germany back in her old place without bayonets. Hitler will only demand what is ours by right. Nations who want peace have nothing to fear. And if they want war, by heaven, they'll get it! But Fritz, now that this man's come to power, what about those who think differently? Freely? Those who are non-Aryan? There's no cause for alarm, my dear. Your mother's worried about me, I think. But that's nonsense, Mother. Men like Father are an honor to Germany. Of course. Men will be judged on their merits, their records. Father, what do you think? Well, I, uh, I shall wait. Men have given great power to Adolf Hitler. Let's hope responsibility brings wisdom. Amen. What's the matter with you, Martin? Nothing. You don't seem very happy about this. I didn't say that, Fritz. Still on the fence, Martin? That won't do, not now. Now, boys, we've been all over this before, you know what I think. This changes everything! Now there'll be one party and only one. A man's got to take a stand. If he's not for us, he's against us... and against Germany. I don't quite agree with you, Otto. Now, we came here to celebrate Professor Roth's birthday, not chew over a whole lot of old arguments. Yes. You're getting very intolerant, all of you. We should be intolerant, of anyone who opposes the will of our leader. Yes, whatever his will might be... persecution, war. What sort of talk is that? Are you a pacifist? I think peace is better than war. A man's right to think as he believes is as good for him as food and drink. That sounds like the sort of swill the Reds dish out. I never expected to hear it at this table! Fritz! Every time I mention it to you... boys, boys... can't we discuss these matters without quarreling? After all, every hen thinks she's laid the best egg. May we not believe as we choose and allow others to do the same? I'm sorry, Professor, but we're all pretty excited. It's been wonderful news, you know. I'm sorry, Professor. Pardoned, old man. Sorry, sir. Well, that's better. Not that I don't like a good argument. I'll go. No, I'll get it. Hello? Hello? Speaking. Yes. Yes, at once. Yes, he's here. I'll tell him. Certainly. Immediately. That was Holl. They've called a meeting at 8:30. We have to attend. Where is it? The university. We've just about time. Mother, that was the district leader. It's a special meeting. It seems an awful thing to do... couldn't you explain? What could I say? That we're having a birthday party? We've got to go. It is a big night, isn't it? What about you, Martin? Coming? No, thanks. Come on, join us. You'll have to sooner or later. Come on, we're late. I'm sorry, Freya, but you understand. It's all right. They want you, strangely enough. Holl's bound to ask for you. Well, tell him peasants have no politics, they keep cows. They want to keep their cows, they better have the right politics. Excuse me, Mrs. Roth. Professor. Aren't you coming? No. Good night. Viktor, what a pity, your birthday party. Yes. It seems as though we'll have to play second fiddle to Herr Hitler. You oughtn't to mind. Huh? Well, that's what they tell us in school. The individual must be sacrificed to the welfare of the state. Oh. Mrs. Breitner! Here, child, here. Mrs. Breitner... the little foal is going to live. It's going to live! I'm to take out the oil stove, Martin says, and some hot water with a drop of wine in it. The stove is ready. You'd better light it. I'll take the hot water. Isn't it wonderful? I was so afraid the little thing would die. But the crisis is past, Martin says. The stove is smoking. Oh. It tried so hard to get on its shaky little legs. Martin says... yes, yes. Run along, Elsa. I'm ready. Don't trip with that stove, child. Martin says I was a great help to him. I'm sure of it. Martin says that all we have to do now is... The greedy little fellow. A little mare, Elsa... a little girl, just like you. I know it's a mare. I don't know why you always talk as if I was a child. I'm nearly 16. Well, listen to that, Mother. The creature thinks she's grown up, huh? Oh, you're stupid. I am grown up. Of course I am! Well, what on earth... Elsa! What's the matter with her, Mother? I was just joking. Take no notice, Son. A girl in her teens... at that age, they are always between smiles and tears. But she was crying. Do you think she's unhappy with us? No, no. She's glad of the work, and I am glad to have her. It's all right, old girl. We've saved your baby. You have a real gift for healing, Son. It's a pity you've given up your studies. You haven't been down to your classes since that night at the Roths... The night Freya was engaged to Fritz Marlberg. Well, it's not that, Mother. You love her, Son. Poor little thing's half-asleep. She's half-tipsy. Hello, everybody! Miss Freya. Hello. Why, Freya, the engaged young lady. And very happy, I suppose. Yes, certainly. Hello, Martin. Hello, Freya. Oh, look at the darling little foal. Is he sick? No, it's been drinking. How's the Professor? Oh, he's fine. Mother, too. They send you their love. Thank you. I'm going in. I have something in the oven. Oh, that sounds very good. We'd better get out of here. Nellie thinks we're up to no good. Oh, but I am, Nellie... at least I hope so. Oh, look. Hello. Come on down to the inn with us. We've all been skiing... Otto is there, and Fritz and Erich. We want you. I'm pretty busy, Freya. You're avoiding us. Well, it's best. Martin, we've been friends for a lifetime. Don't you remember the pact of eternal friendship we all wrote... And signed with our blood? Well, it's just because I want to keep that friendship that I'm trying to avoid a quarrel. But the boys are friendly. They want to see you. Oh, Martin, we ought to make every effort to save our old happiness. We won't talk about anything serious. We'll just sing and laugh and be silly, the way we used to. Don't desert us now. We need you. You're so sane. I hope I am. All right. You're the sanest person I know. Come on. We'll ski down over land and back. The snow is perfect. How I've missed you. It's wonderful! Wonderful! Watch the tree! Our glorious dead... Oh, what should we say of the day that they died? We'll say... Oh, why wonder why that we hope you will die? Sing... The days of our sadness have now disappeared It's only the gladness of life that we hear And while we sing our toast, there is nothing we need fear So sing... So sing... Nothing like a good song to raise the thirst. We're out of ammunition. Theresa, another bottle. Here's Freya at last! And with Martin! Make it a couple bottles, Theresa, something special. I've brought the hermit. Good work, Freya. Hello, Martin. How are you? Hello, Martin. Sit down, you old bear! Like old times. Where have you been? We've missed you. You've missed a lot of excitement, too. Hello, Theresa. You're welcome. I've had nothing stronger than buttermilk for weeks. The best wine we've got. Good. I hope this means you're with us in more ways than one. We want you. You're too good a man to lose. We've always hung together. Let's keep up the good work. Holl, the district leader, was asking about you just the other night. Fritz, please... no politics. Says you could be a power among the peasants. Boys, I'm a farmer, not a party man. Freya just said no politics. Prosit, Freya. To... Our friendship. Prosit. Oh, Mr. Werner. Well, well, Martin. Glad to see you. Good evening. Freya, you remember Mr. Werner, my old teacher? Certainly I do. He's teaching your younger brother Rudi now. Rudi thinks the world of you, Mr. Werner. There's Holl. What's he gonna think? How's your mother? Fine, thank you. She asked about you several times. Thank you. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler, Mr. Werner. Good evening. Mr. Werner, won't you sit down with us? Thank you, my dinner's waiting at my usual table. Perhaps later. Go ahead, folks! How about another song? Name your choice, what'll it be? Good morning, beautiful Miller girl! I'll name a song! A song that every loyal German man and woman will sing with high hearts! A glorious song of a new Germany! Close up the ranks Let every man be fearless Our victory's near We'll crush our every foe Our leader calls, and we will follow him to glory Unto our death Our loyalty will grow Our leader calls, and we will follow him to glory Unto our death Our loyalty will grow Let cowards quake As storm troops march before them Our very strength Will claim their blood of life Into the crowd we stand before our great leader All hail to him In victory and strength No race on earth Can keep our land from glory We are by birth The rulers of the world What's the matter with you? That's the teacher again! It's an insult! Are you dumb, or don't you like our glorious song? He's asking for trouble. I beg your pardon, but surely a man is free to sing or not as he pleases. I don't want to hear any excuses from you, I want to hear you sing, understand? I'm telling you to sing! Huh? Sing. Take it easy, Holl. This man's a friend of mine. Oh. Birds of a feather, eh? If you know what's good for you, Martin Breitner, you'll keep your snoot out of this. Don't concern yourself, please. I'm leaving. Come on, Mr. Werner. I don't think you want a brawl. It's 8 against 2, you know. Let them go. Let them go! I'm sorry you did that, my boy. It might get you into trouble. Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself. Want me to go along with you? No, no, please. I'll be all right. Thank you, Martin. All right, sir. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. I should think you would be. Getting up from our table to brawl with the top man in the party. Erich, I said I was sorry. That old chap's been decent to me. I can't stand by and see him bullied. Look here, Martin... We've been friends for years, and I think it's time we had an understanding about this. Now, Fritz... I'll do the talking. We're in a state of revolution. If we follow the will of our leader, it will be a bloodless one. I follow him. And I. And I. I hope soon to have a share in enforcing it. I see anyone who opposes it as an enemy of his country. And I'm not willing to be seen in his company. Fritz, I persuaded Martin to come... keep out of this, Freya. It's no woman's business. We want to know where you stand. We want to know whether you're going to join the party and work for Germany, or herd with the pacifist vermin we're going to stamp out. We want to know. Right now! They're beating up a teacher! Serves him right! You want to know if I intend to join your party. Well, I can tell you now, the answer's no! What are you doing? Never mind. You're not going after that fellow! That fellow... your lifelong friend! Freya! Freya! I'm sorry you saw this, but it can't be helped. Leave me alone, leave me alone! Glasses... my glasses. Oh, Mr. Werner, I'm afraid they're broken. Simka Goldman's little man was very, very small Very, very small Ha ha ha ha, ho ho ho ho He was very small, you see When they got romantic, he was bouncing on her knee... It doesn't become women to mix in public affairs. And it's particularly unwise for you. What nonsense. I picked up an old man's hat. Listen to me, Freya. There are changes coming that may make your father's position very difficult, and you're not helping him any by flaunting pacifist sympathy. What has this to do with my father? Oh, you mean because his non-Aryan. Men like my father are above politics. You don't know what you're talking about. If your party threatens men like my father, then we disagree more than I'd realized. You're taking a very strange tone. Surely I have the right to ask for loyalty from the woman I'm going to marry. Yes, Fritz, you have. You have to make up your mind to be heart and soul with me in my convictions, or... Or what? Or we can't go on. I think you're right. I don't think I shall ever be heart and soul with your convictions. I'm not going to argue with you about it. Women don't know anything about politics. Oh, let's forget it. If I was rude, I'm sorry. But you know these things are awfully important to me. But you needn't bother your head about them. Heil... good afternoon, Lehman. Good afternoon. There's a new order. I should say "Heil Hitler," but I won't. Not to you. Thank you, Lehman. That is unless some of the other gentlemen are present... or the students. Yes, I shall understand. Heil Hitler. Uh, Heil Hitler. Uh, Fritz Marlberg. Shall we continue the experiment that we commenced on the separation of the red blood corpuscles? And you can help me with the centrifuge later. Before we, uh, resume our experiments on the physical composition of the blood, are there any questions? Well? Is it your opinion that there is no difference between the blood of an Aryan and the blood of a non-Aryan? Those are the findings of science. Until now, physiology has been unable to discover any difference in the blood of the various races. Do you hear that? It's a direct contradiction to our leader's principle of racial purity! It's an impudent defense of racial degeneration, and it's a lie! I've given you the facts... scientific truth is scientific truth! Unchangeable and eternal! It cannot be altered to suit the policies of the hour, or the clamor of immature hoodlums! I demand that every loyal follower of our leader leave this room immediately! From now on, this class is strictly boycotted! And those who remain do so at their own peril. We burn you! We burn you! We burn you! We burn you! We burn you, Heinrich Heine, because your poisonous sentimentality enervates the strong soul of German youth! We burn you! We burn you! We burn you, Albert Einstein, because you have advanced a false and pretentious theory! We burn you! We burn you! We burn you! We burn you! I'm sorry, but that's my decision. I can't accept it. I've never thought of anyone but you. All these years must mean something. I'd be a fool to let you end them because of a silly squabble over politics. It's more than a silly squabble over politics. I know now I couldn't live in your world. It's because I know it's going to be difficult, but I want to help you. But how can you help me? You belong to this new Germany that's come between us... This new Germany that persecutes my people. Freya, I love you. That's all that matters. It's all over. Freya, there's something I've got to say. What, Martin? Well, since that business with my teacher at the inn, things have been happening. Two of our men at the farm have been ordered to leave, by uncle's shop has been wrecked, and most of my old friends cross the street when they see me coming. Perhaps you shouldn't be seeing me. Why, Martin, you can't be serious. You're the only friend I have left, the only person I can talk to. I've never felt so completely alone in my life. Good to see you. That fellow with your sister... isn't that Martin Breitner the veterinarian? Yes, we forbade him from the house, but we'll settle this once and for all. Good evening. I thought I made it clear that you were unwelcome here. Otto! I forbid you to enter this house again or to have any further association with my sister. How dare you! Be quiet. Get inside. I think it's for Professor and Mrs. Roth to decide whether I enter their house. And I shall continue to see your sister until she herself forbids me to do so. I'll see you to the door. Why does this have to happen? I shouldn't have come. It may hurt you. Martin, they haven't gone. They're going to wait for you, I know. Don't worry, I can take care of myself. Please don't go, I'm frightened. Please, Freya, go inside now. Good night. Be careful. I will. Father! Father! Freya! Freya, what is it? Your father's not home. It's Martin... they'll kill him! Hurry, Mother, help me stop them! Boys! Please, stop it! Otto, stop them! Boys! For shame! Martin, are you hurt? No, I'm all right. Come inside, Martin. Oh, Martin, I'm so ashamed. They were guests in our home, and you're a friend. I'll be going. Anytime these gentlemen want to continue their brawl, they know where to find me. Good night, Mrs. Roth, Freya. I'm sorry. I'm happy my husband wasn't here to see his home disgraced by my sons. I shall report the attitude of your relatives toward that fellow. You'll need to explain your own position at headquarters. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. That settles it. That settles it. We shall have to leave this house. Leave home? Naturally. We've no choice now. That's Father. Oh, I'm late. I told you not to wait up for me. What's the matter? You look tired. You feeling all right? Well... something happened tonight, Viktor, which has convinced the boys they must leave the house. Leave the house? It's the best way. For all of us. But, boys, this is your home. We warned you to forbid Freya to associate with Martin Breitner. This is the result. You ask me to force your sister to give up a lifelong friend, a young man we've always liked and respected. No, I... I couldn't do that. You and your brother have chosen your way, and we've respected your decision. We're entitled to the same tolerance. But you risk your safety. I've never prized safety, Erich, either for myself or my children. I've prized courage. Then you must expect to face the consequences. Where will you go? Will you be comfortable? We'll be all right, Mother. I'm sorry this had to happen. Good night. Good night, Mother. Good night. Freya, you must see. Get out. Oh, Freya! Hello, Martin. Why didn't somebody tell me? Where's Mother? She's out in the dairy. Oh. You're looking at the bride cups, huh? Oh, is that what they are? They're lovely. Yes, at the wedding feast, the newly married couple must drink out of the same cup. That's why they're so big. Uh-huh. An old custom in our family. "Hubert and Anna, 1875." Martin, I'm terribly ashamed about last night. Although, for a pacifist, you gave a pretty good account of yourself. It was a good fight while it lasted. I can't say I was sorry, though, when your mother stepped in. Here, look... here's a very old one. 1790. "Kasper and Magdalena." You were right about not coming down to see me again. It would be terribly dangerous. You saw yourself how Otto and Erich have changed. Yes, yes, I know. I'll come up and see you. That is, if you want me to. If I want you to? Freya... Look at this cup. It hasn't any name on it. No. No, not yet. It's mine. Oh... Guess I always wanted something I don't deserve. Freya... Have I a chance? Mr. Werner, good evening. Hello, Mr. Werner. How are you? Good evening. You must be frozen. Here, come over to the fire. Mother! We have a visitor. Can I take your coat? Good evening. Frau Breitner, I shouldn't have come here, but it was my only chance to escape arrest. Arrest? You were right to come. You're isolated here. I thought perhaps I could find a hiding place. Yes, but you wouldn't be safe. We're your friends. They'd think of that. Of course. In the woods, perhaps? Oh, no. They'd search the woods. Then perhaps I'd better go before I put you all in danger. Your only chance is across the border. And just one way to get into Austria safely. Through the Karwendel pass. That's all unguarded country, but there's a way across the crest, I found it as a boy. It'll be pretty tough going, but we can make it. You'll go with me? No one but Martin could get through the pass at night. But if they found out I'd been here, you could never come back. I have a brother at Innsbruck. Martin can wait there until I send him word that it's safe to come home. But I can't accept this. Save your breath. You'll need it for the climb. Mother, I'll need some food and brandy. Elsa! Get my knapsack for me. There's a storm coming up. Be careful. I'll be all right. I've done it lots of times. Promise me you'll come back safely. I promise. I don't know how to thank you. In these days, we must help each other. Good-bye, Mr. Werner. Good luck to you. Good-bye, Elsa. I'll bring you a nice, new apron from Austria. I'll pray for you. Good-bye, Mother. I'll wait for word at Innsbruck. God be with you, Son. Good-bye, Freya. Good-bye. Take care of her. Ready, sir? Ready. I love him. Does he know? Yes. I am very happy, my dear. I always hoped. I'm very, very happy. Look, is that the patrol? What shall we do? They'll find out, and they'll take us to prison! Elsa, Elsa, be calm. Listen, child, if they discover Werner was here and went with my son, they might follow and overtake them. They might kill them. No! You don't want any harm to come to Martin? Oh, no, Mrs. Breitner. That's why I'm afraid. Child, my son's life is in your hands. Will you remember that? I'll try. I will. But they can make you speak, I've seen it. Shh. I've seen them, I tell you. I saw them take some students. I heard them scream. Mrs. Breitner, don't let them ask me any questions, please. If I should say anything to hurt Martin, I'd kill myself. Finish drying your dishes, child, as if nothing had happened. Don't speak. Don't call any attention to yourself. Go on, now. Don't be afraid. Freya. They're coming around the barn. Come and sit down, my dear. It's good to have something to do. Courage. What do you want? Have you seen the schoolmaster, Werner? No. Hasn't been here, huh? No. Max... you and Semple search the barn and stables. You, too, George. Take that lamp and search the back rooms. And make a good job of it. Where's your son? In the village. When do you expect him back? At any moment. What are you doing here? I came this afternoon on a visit. You don't choose your friends very carefully, do you, Miss Roth? I wonder at that. You know, your name doesn't sound very well to German ears. When did you last see Werner? Two weeks ago, at the inn. You're prepared to swear that he hasn't been here, that you haven't seen him today? Yes. Do you know it's a crime to shield a traitor? Certainly. You're young, Miss Roth, much too young to waste your years in a concentration camp. Oh... Elsa... Come here. Hans! I don't know anything. I haven't seen the schoolmaster. I haven't seen him, I tell you! Or Martin, either. Oh, you haven't? You haven't seen Martin Breitner, eh? You're pretty eager to tell me that, aren't you? I wonder why. Look here... don't you try to make a fool out of me! I'll take you down to headquarters and you can tell your lies to the secret state police. I don't know anything! They'll make you talk! They have ways of making girls like you talk! You did see him, didn't you? No! You liar! I'll find proof! There's no sign of him. Yes, I know. He's gone. You helped him to get away, didn't you? I ought to take you down with me... Under arrest. But I won't. I like to be kind to women. If you confirm the facts that that girl just gave me, I'll say that you were forced to act against your will. What do you say? So... Your son will be back soon. Good. Have him report to headquarters first thing tomorrow morning... without fail. Unless he comes in before noon, it'll be better for him, my good Frau Breitner, never to come at all. Believe me. I didn't tell them. I was afraid, but I didn't tell them! God bless you, child. Thank you. He can never come back now. You were out early, Freya. Yes, I had to go to the library to do some research work for Father. I'm so happy about his book. His missed his classes terribly at first. Thank goodness with his experiments and his book he seems quite happy. But you're not. Oh, I'm all right, Mother. Don't worry about me. Freya, I'm going to tell you something, Dear. Close the window. I shouldn't tell you this, Freya, your father asked me not to tell a soul. He's going to Vienna. Mother. He's going to lecture at the medical congress. Then that means I can go to Innsbruck. I can see Martin. Yes. When? Next week. No. So soon? Oh, Mother. Oh, Darling. There's your father now. Oh, Lehman, I thought it was Father. Who is it, Dear? It's Lehman. Oh, Lehman! Has anything happened? That's father's coat, has there been an accident? No, no, miss. It's not that. Then what is it? Two gentlemen came, ma'am, and asked for the Professor. Yes? I told them that he was working on his experiments. And then what happened? They took him away. Who took him away? They, Frau Professor. They arrested him? I brought his coat and rubbers. I hope no harm will come to him. No one will help us. No lawyer will plead for us. They dare not. But you're his superior, you have a right to ask, to know where he is and why they've arrested him. Believe me, Mrs. Roth, I'd be doing you no service, and it would be extremely dangerous for me. Your husband is an eminent man, but I have a family. I must think of them. But I'm sure your sons would have greater influence with the Gestapo. Professor Roth was apprehended because he sustained a theory antagonistic to our most sacred ideals. I'm not permitted to give you any information regarding his whereabouts, and I suggest that you cease pushing these tactless inquiries. They only serve to call attention to your undesirable connections. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Miss Roth. Please forgive me for bothering you. Sit down, Miss Roth. Thank you. I suppose you know that my father has been arrested. Yes. We don't even know where he is, whether he's dead or alive. We thought that perhaps you might be able to help us. I regret that such inquiries are not handled by my department. But I am told that they are handled by your superior. At least he knows where my father is. That's all we ask, is to find out what's happened to him, if we can possibly be of any help. The office concerned sees fit to withhold information. There's nothing I can do. So you haven't forgiven me. You misjudge me. I'm concerned with justice, not revenge. Justice! Fritz, you know my father is a just... please! I told you this matter was not my concern. If you came in the hope that I could be influenced by my personal feelings... I came because I remembered you as a generous and kind person, because I'm not ashamed to ask a favor of you because you once loved me. You're my last hope. Do this one thing for me, and I promise not to bother you again. Fritz, please help me! My father helped you, he loved you and was proud of you. Will you leave, please? It was unfair of you to come... To take advantage of an old friendship. Freya... What you ask is difficult and dangerous, but I'll find out where your father is and try to arrange for your mother to see him. Fritz. I regret, Miss Roth, there's no point in further discussion. You're Emelia Roth? Come. Wife of prisoner Roth? Yes. Emelia Roth. The prisoner Roth is in barracks 8, isn't he? Yes, sir. He should be working now with the labor gang. Yes, sir. I'll permit you 5 minutes with the prisoner. You're to talk only on family affairs. What have you got there? A few things socks, shirts, some fruit. Not permitted. Go. Come. Emily. Oh, my dear! They didn't tell me. What a happy surprise. Sit down. Yeah. Viktor... You'll find me changed, older, but I'm well. Oh, Viktor, your hands. No, please, my dear. It distresses me. We all must work, but it does us no harm. Emily, dear, we have so little time. Forgive me, Dear. There's so many questions. How... how are the children? Well. And Rudi, does he know? No... no whispering! We told him you were on a trip. Oh, I'm glad. There's no need to tell him, ever. He shouldn't learn to hate. They can't keep you here. You've done nothing wrong. Well, I'm afraid they don't agree with you, my dear. They think that your husband is a very bad, obstinate old man. But they will release you... Soon. I don't think we should be too certain of that. You see, even if they let me out, I should still fight for scientific truth. Don't antagonize them, Viktor, for my sake, for the children. Emily, it would be unworthy of the love that we have for each other for me to be less than myself. But I must hope. Of course you must, and you can help. You can give me peace of mind. You must take Freya and Rudi out of the country. And leave you here? It's only for a little while. Germany will find freedom, belief in God... you were told to talk only about family matters. Yes, to be sure. You see, I'm a very bad, obstinate old man. I won't go without you, Viktor. Don't ask me, please. I see you can be stubborn, too. While we're waiting, get everything in readiness. Yes, I'll do that. I'll... time's up. Already? This way. Oh, please, just a few minutes more. It's no use, my dear, we must say good-bye. You mustn't worry about me. I do very well. I've made many friends. You will be free soon? Yes, I shall be free, my dear. God bless you. God keep you all. This way. What is the cube of "a" plus "b," assuming that "a" equals 3 and "b" equals 4? I've done that one. What's the answer? Right. You can put your books away now. You've done enough. When are we going away? The minute that Father comes back. But when is Father coming back? Soon, Rudi, I'm sure. We may have news from him any day now. You always say that, Mother. But you have to have patience, Son. I'm leaving now, Frau Professor. Here are your wages, Marta, and your reference. I've written that you've been with us for 15 years, were always reliable and loyal. I'm sorry to go, ma'am. You've always treated me right, but with my brother in the post office, working for the government, as you might say, it didn't seem right to stay, especially with the Professor... we understand, Marta. It's quite all right. At Christmas when you got all the presents, you promised to stay with us forever. Is that so, Mr. sauce box? Things have changed since then. I should think you'd have noticed that. You owe me 20 phennigs for the milk this morning. My brother will be calling for my trunk. Good-bye. Good-bye, Marta. Otto, you're... You have news of Father. Mother... He's not free, then? Mother, be brave. He is free... At last. Oh. They killed my father. He died of a heart attack. Did you see him? No. They don't allow it. They don't dare, because they killed him. These maniacs you believe in killed him, and you know it! They killed my father! Mother! What's wrong? We're going away now, Rudi. This way, please. I'll bet Martin will meet us. At Innsbruck, I hope. We're coming to a station. What time is it, Mother? 8:30. That must be the border. I beg your pardon. Do you know if we leave the train for inspection? No. I think it's usually done on the train. We hear they're very strict, especially with immigrants. My wife is a little nervous. She doesn't mean to say anything against it. We understand. Here we are! Rudi, sit down, Dear. Heil Hitler. Passport inspection. Heil Hitler, German customs money control. Is anyone present carrying more than 10 marks or plan to take out of the country any foreign money, gold, jewels, or any other valuables? Any violations of the laws covering needs of pension will be punished by penal servitude, special cases by death. Miss Freya Roth? Your passport. Whose suitcase is that? Mine. Take it down. Open it. It's not locked. What is that, code? No. It's a manuscript, a physiological treatise. Who wrote it? My father. Who is your father? Professor Viktor Roth. He's not with you? He's dead. Get that one down. Why are you taking this out of the country? It was my father's last work. He wrote it with his own hand. You intend on publishing it abroad? Oh, no. I hadn't thought of such a thing, it isn't even finished. I brought if for sentimental reasons only. I can't take the responsibility of allowing you to cross the border with this document. But why? I treasure the manuscript because it was my father's last work. Surely there isn't anything suspicious about that. This is a matter that can only be decided by my superior. I must ask you to follow me. But, officer... it's all right. You go on, you and Rudi... you must! I'll take a later train. I can't leave you here alone. Nothing can happen, they can't object to the manuscript. Now will you come, please! Good-bye, Rudi. Good-bye, Mother. Tell Martin to be patient. Come! I expected to follow my mother immediately. It's been 5 days now. Won't you please be convinced that I had no intention of doing anything wrong and let me go? I'll explain to you why you're under detention. This manuscript is a seditious production, sustaining a theory destructive to the new ideals. It will be destroyed. And I... I may go? No. Your passport is confiscated. You cannot be allowed to leave the country. But why? How am I to blame? You anxiety to remove this script proves your intention to publish it in foreign countries. You belong, in part, to the German race, but by your action you have shown yourself unworthy to represent that race abroad. You will report to the police daily. Let me warn you to be extremely careful in your conduct and in your contacts. That is all. Freya! Hello! My dear, I am so thankful. I was afraid you wouldn't dare. I was afraid I would get you into trouble. You don't think you were followed? No. I was very careful. Why did you send for me? Is there a message? Why are you smiling? Oh! Oh, Martin. I didn't dare let myself believe it. You shouldn't have come. It was so crazy, so dangerous. Freya, I've come to take you away. To Innsbruck? Yes. When? Now. Now? I need never go back to town? No. I need never let you go? Nothing will ever part us again. No, no, it's not real. We've got to get across the border before daybreak. I promised your mother I'd bring you home. But the journey isn't easy, Freya, you've got to know what you're taking on. It's a long, hard way. I know. I'm pretty sure nobody suspects the spot I cross the border, but there's always the danger of patrols. I'm not afraid. Then we'd better get busy. So soon? I have so many questions. We've no time to talk. We have so much to say. We've never said the usual foolish things. Do you know we've never said I love you? We have our whole lives to say them. Children. It's getting dark, you have no time to waste. You're sure you have everything? I think so, Mother. Your flashlight? Yes, yes, it's right in there. Mother, when Freya's missed, they may suspect... I can take care of myself, Son. Elsa, hurry please. Thank you, Elsa. I think you'd better go down to the inn and spend the night with your aunt. Oh, but please, can't I stay... it's better for you to be seen there tonight. If there should be trouble, you won't be suspected of having a hand in it. It's for your own sake, child. Say good-bye now and get along. Elsa... Good-bye, Elsa. Oh, you've been wonderful. Bye. Good-bye. Won't you say good-bye to me, too, Elsa? Good-bye. Thank you. Thank you for helping us so bravely. I'll pray for you... Both of you. Mother, it's hard to leave you here alone. I can manage. I still have my strength and health. You will find things in order when you come back, because you will come back. This is your home. This soil belongs to you, as it did to your forefathers. I want you and Freya to take a glass of wine before you start. This is apple wine from the fruit of Martin's tree. You know it, don't you? I used to rest in the shade of it when I was expecting him to be born. I nursed him under its branches. He held on the trunk in his first efforts to walk. It's Martin's tree. Now I want you to drink the wine of its fruit from the bride cup. I hope to see you married in the little church at the foot of our mountain, with the music of the organ and the good father to give you the blessings. But since it cannot be, after your marriage, I'll have your names painted on the cup. But for me, this is the moment of your wedding. May the blessing of God be upon my son... And upon his wife. Amen. Amen. And now go. Let her alone! She doesn't know anything! She's just a child! Let her alone! Let her alone! So, Karwendel pass. I didn't think it possible in winter! He's an excellent climber. He's pretty smart... it's an unguarded section. He has a start, but he's hampered by the woman. Let's see... Now, this is the point where the fugitive should emerge from the pass. Marlberg, you will take a patrol in motor cars to Laudenfens. That should cut your cross-country climbing by half. You ought to be able to reach the section before your quarry. I most respectfully request to be relieved of this command. What do you mean? I once looked upon these two people as my closest friends. I am aware of that. I realize that this duty must be carried out, but I beg of you to understand a human weakness, to send someone else to command the patrol. You have sworn allegiance to the third Reich. In the service of your country, there are no human relationships. I have given you an order. I am waiting to know whether you will show yourself worthy of the trust that our leader has placed in you or whether you will dishonor me, your comrades, and yourself. At your command, I shall be on Karwendel pass with my men before daybreak. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Martin. Martin! Am I going to fast? I'm sorry. Every time I look back, you seem to be smaller. Martin, we're not lost, are we? Oh, no. Are you afraid? Not when your arm is around me. Are we halfway? Yes, I think so. Your face is so small and white. You're very tired, aren't you? No, no, I'm not tired. Really I'm not. All right. Do you have any idea where we are? We should be near Karwendel pass. Should be? We'd better be, unless you want them to slip over the border ahead of us. We're doing the best we can, aren't we? Martin, come on, let's stop a minute. I'm not really tired. It's just difficult to breathe so high up. Oh, I know, Darling. I think we can reach the pass in about an hour, less, perhaps, if your strength just holds out. You're my strength. I won't fail you. I know you won't. All right. You ready? Freya! Freya, look! Look, it's Austria! It can't be true. We just have to go down that open space there. Those high rocks are on Austrian soil. And free. Come on, I'll race you down the slope. Do you think you can make it? I can try. All right. What is it, Martin? A patrol. No. Yeah, right to the right, there. Back, they'll see us. We have one fighting chance, Freya. Shall we make a try for it, or shall we go back? Go back to what, Martin? Be careful. Good luck. There they are! We'll head them off. Halt! Halt! Halt! Well? 800 paces. Take aim. Keep firing! Keep firing! They're over the border. You clumsy fools, you've missed him! Cease firing! Why, Martin, did I faint? Yes, Darling. But we made it, didn't we? We're free? Yes, we're free. Listen, you can hear the church bells from the village. We're almost there, Darling. No, no, wait. Let me rest a little. Dear, Martin... I am tired now. Yes, very, very tired. Oh, no, Freya. Oh, no. Oh... We met them on Karwendel pass. I ordered them to halt, but they refused to obey. At my command, the patrol opened fire. They were able to cross the border, but... Freya was hit. She died before reaching the village. I had no choice, it was my duty! Freya killed... Freya. It doesn't make sense. And Breitner goes free! Yes, free to think as he believes. Well, wasn't that what he said? Free to fight against all we stand for. Yes. Thank God for that. Freya. 6 candles, one for each decade of a wonderful life. Now blow them all out and make a wish. We've been a very united family. In this house, we've had the habit of gracious living. We've prided ourselves on our tolerance and our sense of humor. Good heavens, here I am making another speech. Well, I can think of no better wish than this: May our happiness last as long as we live. I think peace is better than war. A man's right to think as he believes is as good for him as food and drink. I... I thank you for your beautiful gift. It shows me, this splendid torchbearer, that you have understood what I have desired to impart and that into your young hands will be given the torch of science when it has fallen from the hands of your masters. I sincerely pray that you will carry it worthily. I said to a man who stood at the gate, "give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown." And he replied, "go out into the darkness "and put your hand into the hand of God. "That shall be to you better than a light and safer than a known way."
