Hey, Miss LEE You off already? Got a date? Shut it, kid. No way! I had to sew up a rip for your sorry ass last time. I've lost weight lately. Just once, please. Please. If someone offers you 5 million won, would you even eat shit? - Don't start now. - Would you or not? - My own or someone else's? - Ha, bastard... OK, yours. But you have to eat... Say 1 kilo. That's too much. Nothing's easy, right? - Fine, half that. - Then I would eat it. Dirty bastard. I'm dirty, so what? I will even dip it in my pee and eat it. See, it fits perfectly! I kinda look like Maggie CHEUNG. What are you doing, kid? Get out of my way. Hey kid, come home early. Look what time it is now. I don't see any bean sprout in the soup. Come here... Come here! You think it's easy? You think life is easy? Funny? You giggling? Do you know how scary the world is? One mistake and your life's over. You're left with nothing. Listen to your father, punk! Listen!

If anyone touches me... I'm gonna kill 'em all. Now, let's read. What's the date today? - It's the 17th. - Right. Number 17, OH Dong-gu. Read. My mind... Huh? Dong-gu. I have only you in my heart. You're a student, I'm a teacher... but I must be a man too. Call me. What are you doing, OH Dong-gu? Ah, yes... Call me. What are you doing? What the heck, man. You join the Ssireum team? Yes, I've finally made a decision about my future. I'm going to play Ssireum hard and become a popular comedian like KANG Ho-dong. - What about the newspaper class? - Ah, I quit Kids even use. Chinese characters there. Come, bring it on. I will give you a good lesson today. Stupid bitch. Shit. I'm JUNG Jong-man and I've decided to stake my life on Ssireum. How do you do? What grade are you? I'm sophomore. Have you played any sports? No. Why don't you do Ssireum? You got some talent. Huh? Coach, I'm the new member. What's your name? - OH Dong-gu. - OH Dong-gu... - Even the name sounds talented. - I'm JUNG Jong-man. Oh yeah? There's toilet paper in the PE room. Bring it to the restroom. Where's all the toilet paper? Nasty. We'll have to see how bad he's hurt but... for now it looks serious. That's the victim's wife there. You'll have to negotiate with her. - Otherwise, your dad will... - Yes. Just lock him in. That's interesting. We got no money anyways so why don't you throw him into a cell? What the fuck is this? Since last week I've been working here... - I look funny, right? - Yes. But the pay is much better. Is Dong-chul still not calling you? No. Oh well. But at least he didn't tell dad where you were. He's turning more like dad. And I don't really like that. Dong-gu, honestly, you hate me, too, right? Right. Mom. Do you have some money? Why, you need some? I sent you less last month, Didn't I? I'm getting paid in two weeks. Is it urgent? No, you should get a facial massage with that money. Look at you I can tell you're a runaway. I'm leaving now. What's this? Take it. I'll come again. Where did you get the money? Don't do anything stupid. What do you know, punk. What a snob. Bitch... - Give me. - You buy yourself! - Hey, fucking faggot OH. - What? I heard you're fucking transferring to another school. To a girls' school. Not funny, you know. Look at this fucker. Who told you to change here? This ain't the girls' locker room. You fucking have a tampon shoved up your ass, right? Let's see. Hey, his boobs are freaking big. Does he even have a dick? Why aren't you at school, you fool. Yo, the young bird lost its nest. - What about you? - I was there briefly. Where would I eat lunch otherwise? You're not working these days, are you? Can you do me a favor? What. If you get a sex exchange operation, show me the thing Vagina. Our life is a jaywalk. 10 minutes of hustle can cost 10 years Crazy. We're crazy. Get off. You're crazy too. We're wasting our youth. Stop it! You suck and you only spit. I'm doing this for you. You wanna be a singer. I'll rap. A mixed duet Nice, isn't it? Geez, why the hell does a wrestler have to practice rap? Get off! Ssireum, I quit. I was going to buy a laptop if I won the Ssireum competition. And a motorcycle. How much is the prize? Hello I'm OH Dong-gu. in sophomore year. I have some questions to ask you. You said I had some talent. And even praised my name. Do I really have talent? - I'm OH Dong-gu. - Did I say that? Yes, OH Dong-gu. Was it a year before... at my previous school there was a boy with a fantastic name. His father named him to become a Ssireum player. Park Born-to-be Chunha Jangsa, the champion or Meant-to-be Chunha Jangsa the champion? Anyways it was the best name. But he's probably the worst player in the world. Umm... if I win the competition, Is the prize 5 million won? We'll have to see whether you've got the talent. - Come to the practice tomorrow. - Coach. Are there any other colors? Hello. Who are you? I'm a newcomer. Tut. We asked for wealth but you gave us poverty to become wiser. Amen. We asked for friendship but... but you told us to love one another. Whoa. What's he doing? Let's have a talk. Can't you see we're praying right now? Yes, I will wait. Go on. - Just give me 5 minutes. - Get the hell out now! Leave! Hey, hey. - Hello. - I said I'd wait What's wrong? Let go. Let's talk for 5 minutes. Hey, we already settled the issue. What more is there to talk about? It's not finished yet! Please talk after the prayer. Now let's finish our prayer. - Seriously. - You can't do this. Please leave now. OK, OK! Let go. Let go of me. I will walk out on my own. I will. So let me go. - OK, Let's go. - Get off of me. What the fuck! Why me? What did I do wrong? - Ah what the... Oh my... - Come here, come here Huh? You think I'll let you get away you mother fucker? Gyungwon High School Umm... aren't you going to wear the trunks? Let's go. We're going outside? No. Gyungwon! Gyungwon! I don't like how our team is frequented by bums like him. Please think about our team spirit. All of you are seniors with no followers after you. If he's not serious, we're better off without him. We'll go to the competition without a newbie. Why... Why so harsh... Hey. What do you call it when you can't digest food? - Coach. - Ah... Indigestion, indigestion. Then I will take care of it. Let him be. If he's to leave, he'll leave If not, he'll stay. That's how life goes on. - Are you having fun? - What? Go play somewhere else, asshole. This is not for sissy boys like you. I'm not going to say it again. Get the hell out. Teacher! Hey, what's up at this hour? I've finally got menarche. Finally, Dong-gu, you've got it. Thanks. Thanks so much. Seriously, I feel like dreaming. Teacher, pinch me. Sure, I'll pinch you. Uh- it doesn't hurt. I see, you had a nightmare. Gyungwon! OH Dong-gu. See? LEE Man-gi, LEE Bong-geol OH Dong-gu. Sounds pretty good, no? Fold this way. Right. Hold and come this way. - What is this called? - Ssatba. - Right, Ssatba. OK? - Yes. Ssat means right here. And Ssatba means a band tied around here. - Then what's here? - What? - You have balls, you know. - Ah, I see. A man's power comes from the balls, OK? Long ago Ssatba was believed to carry Chunha Jangsa's energy. So every woman made underpants with it and wore them to have a baby boy. Why? Because this was the source of energy. And it's not wholly superstitious. Because in the beginning of a match how you grab the other's thigh band or how yours is grabbed determine the winner and the loser. So that's how important Ssatba is OK? Then what does it mean to have Ssatba tied for the first time? Now you're a Ssireum wrestler. Help yourself! But don't leave! Forbid eating for Physical club Hey, give him a hand or something. Who would sing at a welcome party as dry as this? Men are looking at me as usual. Only dorks hit on me. I'm a woman of pride and attitude. If you got guts, come here, you green horns. There's no feeling, no fun, no nothing. Men are all the same. They're all green horns. Quite good. At first I was going to wash them separately but the colors bled too easily. Maybe made in China? Add arms like this. - Like this? - Yeah, something like that. It's hard. You just have to practice a bit. It's easier than you think. You joking? Don't mind him. He does that when he gets a boner. Not sure what he's thinking. You wanna be good a wrestler? Yes. Fine, I will teach you, give you a quick training. In return you teach me dancing. Also a quick course. Grab Ssatba tight. Now you're on your feet. Spread your legs as wide as your shoulder. That's right. Then slightly bend your knees. Good. Then you twist your left foot just a little. About 45 degrees. How's it? You think you got it? It's hard. It's always harder in the beginning. Let's try the outer-leg tackle first. See I pull you towards my body. Then you're to come towards me. Relax, dude. I am. Anyways, when I pull you like this. See? Your body moves. My left foot steps forward to transfer the weight to front. And I trip you from the right side! See, you can't do anything. You get it? This is the outer-leg tackle. It's quite complex. It's because you're still a rookie. Once you get it it's easy. Now what next. Should we try the inner-leg tackle? This is the most widely used skill, which means it's a sure thing. Stay as you are. Try to resist. This is supposed to knock you down. So done with the inner-leg stuff. What next? Rest? You not tired? - Yes. - OK, 10-minute break. I put mustard on my ass and it reeks! So you've done some research on the Internet, yeah? Kid, a rookie like you can hurt the spine trying the over-head throw. I know... but still. An almost pro like me does it once a while to relax the muscles. Can you at least show it to me? The inner-leg. Today we go over the inner-leg skill. Young-bae. Wrestle with Dong-gu. What? Coach, he's just a newbie. Practice as if it's a real match. What are you three doing every day? Composing a ballet? You should feel honored, dude. Take it off, kid. Eh? - What's that? - I got hurt. Have you got bitten or something? Ready. Look how white he is like a girl. Woo, you're making me nervous. Go. That's right. Right on. That's the tripping. You did as I told you and it worked! That was really great. Now, let's have a real match. Start. By the way, why are all Ssatba purple? You got some strength. You see the sty? I wasn't in my best condition. I think I should quit Ssireum. My armpits are just too sensitive. Awake vicious enterpriser. Smile! Smile Sir, it's misspelled. Get away, little brat. Smile What is it? What's that fucker doing there? - Get him out of here now. - Yes, sir. - What is wrong with you? - Let go. This isn't your land. Just go inside. What were you thinking? After you beat up the president like that you expect to get your job back? I just couldn't let him fire me for no reason. Fuck. I'd rather starve to death. Fucking embarrassing. Hey bro, that's life and that's how we live. Yo! Yo, you fuckers! You're in Korea so speak Korean. OK? Fuckers... Get out! You from Vietnam? The Philippines? Go back to your own country. This place is fucking messed up enough for us Koreans. Man... I don't understand a word you're saying. Just drink up, motherfucker. Hey you fucker PARK Jin-cheol! This is still strong, you know? One punch will knock the world. I'm fucking OH Yong-taek. Sorry bro. I'm sorry. I or someone else must have been fired. Just... I'm sorry, man. Worry for yourself, stupid ass. I'm gonna get back to work soon. You think I'm just going to let this happen to me? Asshole... You know we have a friendly match with Wooseong High the week after? - Yes. - Get ready. What? It'll be a good experience before the actual competition. Prepare yourself. Yes. Thank you, thank you, coach. Gyungwon! Yo, faggot OH! - Fucking, eh? Faggot! - We'll fucking bust your ass. You don't even know Katakana but speak English? What's faggot, huh? Do you know how to spell the word? - B... - A... Geez, you rats. Go inside and study. We'll have a quiz later. Hey, Dong-gu. I heard you do Ssireum these days. I was surprised, kid. I've never imagined you'd do Ssireum. I... got talent, coach said. Really? I should think better of you, OH Dong-gu. Do your best. Now that you've started it. What you might call it... 'Chunha Jangsa'. Win that title, alright? Go on. Teacher. I'll really do my best and come to you with my head up high. - Good. - Teacher, I will call you. You've held out. I'm not sure why you're still here but don't be so stuck up just because you won a few times. What you're doing is not even Ssireum, asshole. Captain. My name is OH Dong-gu. Don't be offended. That's how that fucker is. He's a nitpicker. I see his discontent for being in a third-grade team like this. Then what is he doing here? If he is that awesome? There's this guy KANG Jae-wuk, his long-time rival. Captain was supposed to be scouted by the Wuseong High. But his chance was sabotaged by that bastard. He always had to be the #1 but after that he lived like a hermit. Honestly who cares about the school? A good ranking gets you into college anyways. It's actually better for him since he can do whatever he wants here. And most of all he can fight against KANG Jae-wuk. He probably went after that. Is that guy, Jae-wuk, that good? See with your own eyes at the friendly match. It will be worth watching. Candy I got a cramp in my leg. I said to take the subway. Hey How many scumbags did you pack in that tiny car? You ready? How strange... you still have them. Must've healed by now. See? All healed now, right? What are you doing? Wow, you got big nipples, boy. Did you put on perfume? Huh? This... this is my body odor. Really? You smell fantastic, man. Let's go, Wuseong! Do your best and don't humiliate yourself. Shut the fuck up. Let's go, Wuseong! Let's go, Wuseong! Where's Dong-cheol? Eat your supper. What wrong? Nothing, I just came by... Just because the weather's great. Well... Remember... When I slapped you... I was very shocked. I felt angry, scared and hated you for being different. What the... I... I'm sorry. Mom, this is size 115. But my foot is here. My feet are so wide to fit my size. I often look at them and think... they're monstrous. How funny they'd look in heels. And how people will laugh if I wear panty hose. I know for sure. I'm going to be a really ugly woman. Whoa, it smells wonderful. I think I put a little too much salt. No, it's delicious... Oh sorry, should I put it out? No, it's not that. Aren't you gonna eat? After this. I used to be really pretty. What's that? Out of the blue... When I was sophomore in high school... so exactly when I was your age. I saw your father boxing for the first time... After three, four dates? I got pregnant with you. I left home immediately and quit school. I thought things would be OK as long as I was with your father. But after he got injured he quit boxing and started drinking. Several years passed away and I realized something was wrong. I know I'm a horrible mother... I'm sorry, Dong-gu. But I'm really happy now. Because I study, make money although not a lot... and live the way I want. Dong-gu, whether you look pretty to others, that's all meaningless. Living a life the way you want is... That is the real life. You know... It might get tougher than you think... much more... you might get tougher than now. Is it OK? Alright, I'll respect your decision. I will... respect it. I didn't know you were here. Where were you past several days? Damn, why am I not surprised? I know people like you. You always have your own way. You don't care about others. You despise and look down on people. I know people like you inside out. But you have no right to look down on me. There's no reason for whoever to do that! Motherfucker, what? We'll have no more of this anyways. I'm quitting the team as your wish. What do you know about Ssireum? Right. I only think about myself. I can't afford to pay attention to others. I only practice and think about Ssireum and I still lose. Every day I practice until my hands fucking bleed and I still lose. And you want to quit your sorry ass? Because you lost one fucking game? Don't give me that shit, fucker. You're wrong. How about the over-head throw? Can I do it if I practice really hard? Do you know why you lost? Hold Ssatba. Tighter! Try to trip me over. You fell because of your strength. Ssireum is not all about strength. Balance is more important. You make your opponent lose balance while keeping yours. That's Ssireum. Don't look, don't think. Just feel it. Understand? Feel my move and find your balance. Start. Too slow. Faster. Feel how I move. If you think 'oh, leg then arm', It's too late. Right, faster. Your right side. Thigh band! Pull it. He was fine till this afternoon. Then he suddenly fainted. Such things really happen. What did the doctor say? It could be brain hemorrhage. What an idiot. Not sure if now is the right time but we got a tight deadline. It's hard to find a new worker. Can I suggest you to the president? He loves whiskey. Get a bottle and... Don't give me that look. What? We still gotta live, you know. Right? I think I have something in my eye. I don't see any. Ah, it's better now. Your eyes seems... slightly different. A little. You look like a Siberian Husky. I'm a bit confused these days because of you. Hello! You fool. Try to escape, yeah? Way to go! You now in the Korean percussion band? Cheer up. Don't kill yourself. An invitation card Hey, Chunha Jangsa, the champion. How's it going these days? Teacher. Yes, what? Just... Just a little... While until I can come to you without any shame. Just a little... What are you talking about? You like that woman, SONG Sun-Mi? - What? - Don't marry her! I... I... love you too. I love you more than she does. And my love started before hers. Can't you just... wait for me a bit? Just a little while... Dong-gu, you punk... - You're a joke! - Teacher... Be quiet when your teacher speaks. Is that how your parents taught you? I've never thought! This is serious. On your stomach now! He can't see you now. - What is it? - I told him... You couldn't see him but... Johnny Walker... How cute... I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Give me work. Please. - Let's have mackerel for dinner. - I already ate. Really? Good. Korean Ssireum Association To Oh Dong-gu I can drink, huh? What can't you eat? You're right. I drink well. Just like my father. I'm really worried. You're better than me. You at least have a dream. You going for bachelor of plastic surgery instead of bachelor of Arts and Science? What's wrong? My dream? Do you know how painful it is to me? It's not that I want to become something. I just want to live a life. Come here. What are you trying to prove? What are you trying to show? Or do you want to see me dead? - Or go mental? - Please stop. It's late. You want me to have a heart attack? Is that what you want? I told you that one thing and you don't respect it. Go ahead. If you're not the best, sports is nothing. Do you think people will treat you with respect, stupid ass? Go in now. If you go tomorrow... I'll kill all. I don't care who! - Stop it. - That piece of shit! Shit! Whatever I do, everything goes wrong. Father. Please look at me. Can't you see? This is me. You asked why Ssireum. I started it to get a scholarship. With that money I'm going to get a surgery and find myself. Piece of shit. Fine. If you need to talk... Let's do it the men's way. Father. Guard your face, look at your opponent. Please hear me out. Guard your face. Coming. Again. Guard your face. Look at your opponent. Look! Look! Look! Get up. The first round hasn't finished. Get up, you fucker. Guard your face. Guard your face. That's right. Right. Right. Why today? Why? Why? Why now? Do you fucking know! What today means to me? This is... Over-head throw. It's the National High School Ssireum Competition sponsored by Incheon City. How does it look? Unlike before, there are many new great wrestlers. Yes, but we cannot ignore senior students' presence either. He's not answering the phone. Should we withdraw his entry? Wait Dong-gu will definitely come. In-cheon Market High school Ssireum Competition Couch's seat - Sorry about yesterday. - Hold on to Ssatba tight. Well... we see JANG Sa-ho, Report seat but not OH Dong-gu. The player should show up within the two minutes from calling. OH Dong-gu from Gyeonwon High, please come to the venue now. Dong-gu! Yo, what's wrong with your face? Who did this to you? You're late. You almost made me pee in my pants. I'm sorry, coach. OH Dong-gu You have a cool name. Have faith in you name, OK? Hello... Let go! Let go! Let go of me. Su-jeong. Su-jeong, what should we do about our son, Dong-gu? Red Ssatba, Gyungwon High. OH Dong-gu wins. Do you know why I hate you? I hate you for drinking shouting and throwing things at me. I hate you very much... Most of all... You hate yourself too much. That's why I hate you. But Dong-gu doesn't hate himself. I'm very thankful for that. I know Dong-gu will have a hard time and go... Through so much more. But I made up my mind. To support his journey. I have no intention to force you. Probably neither does Dong-gu. Do your best as you did in practice. OK? Hold out till the end then... OK? Let's go kids! Gyungwon! Fighting! Hey, hey. You can do it. Don't be so chicken, OK? Go! - Red, Kim Sung-shik from Gyengwon. - I'm fine. Why would I be nervous... - Blue, from Sangjin High's. - When I'm going to lose? PARK Born-to-be- Chunha Jangsa. You'll win for sure. If you hold out till last, you will definitely win this match. PARK Meant-to-be-Chunha Jangsa looks very fit. It's not 'Meant-to-be', it's 'Born-to-be'. Yes, it's Born-to-be... On your feet. Ready. Red KIM Sung-sik wins. KIM Sung-sik win PARK Joon-woo win OH Dong-gu win SONG Young-bae win OH Dong-gu win PARK Joon-woo Vs KANG Jae-wook PARK Se-choon Blue, KANG Jae-wuk from Wuseong. Red, PARK Jun-wu from Gyungwon. Wuseong High school, fighting! This is the end for you. On your feet. Ready. PARK from Gyungwon, to the finals. You shouldn't have tried the same skill again. Don't smile. Only think about your game. OH Dong-gu Only a sophomore but a great athlete. It hasn't been long since he started Ssireum. Yes, PARK Se-chun was fourth last year. And it's amazing that OH has defeated several good players and made it to the semi-finals. The clock is ticking towards the end. The match is over. In this case, what's next? The athletes' weight will be measured. Whoever weighs less wins. PARK from Yeongjin High, 80.2kg. Gyungwon High's OH, 80.0kg. OH Dong-gu wins! OH from Gyungwon High goes to the finals.

Guard your face, look at your opponent. It is OH's first time to take part in a Ssireum competition and he has made it to the finals. Teammates from the same school compete at the final match. Beat me no matter. What I'm going to win too no matter what. Stand up. Ready. PARK wins the first round with a very technical skill. Red, OH Dong-gu wins. We'll now begin the very final round.
