Girls, stop! Why are you laughing and talking so loud? You forget that women's voices not be heard by the men outside. How often must I repeat it?

Go to your class. Do not you see men up there? - There was a thief with Miss Hussa. - Dummis, it was not a thief, but... her lover. Her father thought it was a thief and called the police. - Did she say "thief ", it was a thief. - Of course you say so, Salma. Just a sinner and jailbird would show interest in you.

A thief. A thief, a thief. I need to buy a nice dress to your uncle's wedding - so that women think about, before they start dreaming about your dad. Forgive me, my dear Leila. I'm really sorry. Iqbal, our driver, is rude. He shouted at poor Aisha today. She cried throughout the journey for three hours. Abir. Mariam's daughter? Come to her with a man? Do you know who he is? Now I know who he is. A playboy like his dad. Is he as good as his dad? Frankly eat father looking. The religious police? Mariam is well completely destroyed. They should have married her off long ago. That kind of girls are actually just a nuisance. Leila, I have to stop now. Dad seems to have come. But I want to know what happens minute by minute in Abir scandal. Take care of yourself. Goodbye. What is it? Do not worry. We marry not you away. Go and saw hi to daddy. Oh, God, why I changed my game? This is strange, as I have lost. - Is the score right, or last year? - Really. I'm good with math. The proof? Pythagoras is God miracle: triangle remains the same.

Why is your mom around and looking for a bride to you? I doubt that she try so much. - Come play with me. - I can not play. Let me play. Band with love songs. Bracelets for football clubs. Do you have a fan club for fotball? Do not you know these things are banned in school? Abir always behaved well. She never caused problems. Do you know that the religious police came on her yesterday with a strange man? Arranged meeting you yesterday between Abir and this man? - No, ma'am, I did not. - Do not lie. I'm sure you were involved. I just do not know how. What shall we do with you now? Expel you? One moment, Miss Jamila. Let me be clear with this girl. You can go back to your class now. We'll see what we will do with you later. Replace those ugly shoes, have regular black shoes like the other girls. What is this? The basis for religious club competition in the Koran knowledge. I really do not know what I say. Principal. All this for a bicycle's sake. As long as I live, no purchase cycle. Should I wait until you get kicked out? Turn off the damn radio and these infernal songs. The songs have just come up with bane to us. You are not better than Abir. The parents married her off. Should I pay? Can not you pay for once? Where's your mileage? Should everything be put into savings association. Where have you dowry for the next bride? What a nifty groom. Do you think I yearn to support two families? Give me a son. Everything will be fine. But we both know that it will not. Forget it and do not count I will at all next week. Do not come! Go home to your mother. Turn your heads together and find brides. Just an hour I wait. You will be late, I will go. You take a taxi. That's enough, Iqbal. We get it. Who is she, that little one, Iqbal? Little girl, my daughter. She is three years old.

We go back to the clerk, Colours so they sew into it a bit. We go before Iqbal gets angry and leave us. Do not worry, he will not go away. Came here with my dress. Who was the boy who spoke about the bike? What boy? What are you talking about? You know very well. Do not sell my bike to someone else. Here. I mixed a tape to you, because we are friends now. But do not sell my bike to anyone. With God's will. Ms. Hussa will explain the rules for Quran competition. It is about five weeks. - I send around a sign-up sheet. - Make the headmaster.

First, the terms and background to God's revelation in the verses. Second part is the recitation. The recitation should be with the correct pronunciation. I repeat. Correct pronunciation is a must.

I say you are my sister. Your sister? No one believes you. I am too cute to be your sister. "I can not arrange transportation today. Could it not be seen as emergency leave?" I still have leave to withdraw. Certainly. Next Month I can stand in for others. It is very kind of you. See you tomorrow. Take care of yourself. - Do you know where the driver Iqbal live? - Many drivers named Iqbal here. I hope we are going in the right direction. That could be Iqbal's car. Yes, it's his. What do you want? Iqbal? This is not my thing. You may speak for yourself. All right. - You? What do you want? - Iqbal, why do you do so? Go away. - Where is your residence? - How so? What do you want? It's a good job. Run Wadjdas mother again, so it is quiet. My uncle, with the mustache, I'll speak with him. You do not have permission. " My uncle, with the mustache..." He knew right away. The mustache is like a trademark. They say the son sat explosives around the waist and bam... He died. - Clueless type! It makes the pain. - Dying man of God is like pinpricks. And then you fly up and get 70 chicks. Can you? Pang! 70 bikes! You have misunderstood the total. " 70 bikes," she says. Come on. Have not you missed us? You have kept you away for two weeks. The key is: Do you think of us or do you have others? If you have the moon, Why are you looking among the stars? Okay. Take care of yourself. Continue studying. Hello? Hello, Leila. So. Will you come? Do you take the money you have for me? Is that true? Do you work at the hospital here next? Is your husband with the that you work together with men? What do you want? My uncle asked me to hang Ijusslingor across the street and pay them on your roof. Attach them to the neighboring house's roof. Not on our roof. They do not have a pole to attach in. Your roof is the only one that has one. Wait a minute. Mom... Thank you, darling. When you want, you may be the world's rarest. Abdalla to turn on Ijusslingor roof, so his uncle wins the election. Say no. Not one of us, so we do not vote for him. Okay, you can go up on a condition. In the morning, take your bike. Hello, Wadjda. You have been great and you are so sweet. - Where's Mom? - She will. - How is school? - I do not like it but it's okay. Traitor! I work in the hospital and I know the last time? Finally with Iqbal! Three hours in his car every day took killing me. In addition, the hospital good hours and good pay. And so the waiting driver at me. When is the party? Next month. Going to buy dress to Wadjdas uncle's wedding. Perhaps future bi wife there. God help those who become his concubine. you can show her hell middle of the day. By the way, they are hiring at the hospital. We could talk all day. My husband is jealous. Seeing someone on me, he turns on the globe. Stop it. You blame everything on your poor husband. - What is it? - It will help you learn to ride a bike. I have to hang up the lights, can not push on you. You think I'm a knatting? I took off the training wheels. You get five Rials if you stop crying. 00:47:03,360... 00:47:06,240 Have all his Koran? Before we begin, you have the mens must not touch the Quran without Kleenex. It's no laughing matter. You are young women now. I said stop. You take it to the edge with a Kleenex, not with your fingers. Page 87. Start with Surat al -Nisa, Ayat 59. Let's start with the new face. Wadjda. Wadjda, start reading. - " O you who believe!" - Higher. " Believers!" - "Obey God and..." - "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger..." - "..And those among you..." - "...To whom responsibility has been entrusted..." - ".. And if you happen to" branch "..." - What " branch"? You read wrong. - ".. And if you get into dispute..." - "... Happen in dispute ; Leave then..." - ".. And if you get into a dispute, transferable when the judgment of God." - Enough. - Noura, continue. "O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and those of you for whom..." "... authority and responsibility entrusted; and if you happen to in dispute " - - " Transferable when deciding to God and the Messenger..." So much pounding on a bike and you can not even ride a bike. I want to buy one. I have a plan. - What is it? - An antenna for all radio stations. My uncle will speak with two famous Quran Reader- - Who " get one's heart to melt." You have not heard mother sing. She should have her own channel. We talk about this later. - Where's the nail polish? - I hid it there, when the creature came. What are you doing here? Why did you run your hand under her skirt? Go immediately into my office. Wadjda, wake up, sweetheart. Get up, so we read the dawn prayer. I saw girls cycling on TV. Give me the money for a bike. I know you have money. I saw them in the box. Here bicycles are not girls. You will not be able to have children if you ride. You cycle not and you can not have children. How can you say so? I almost died when I found you. Wash before prayer. Girls! Who will find a 'Tajwid' on page 92? - Which verse? - Verse 88? "He who..." - What kind of 'Tajwid' recitation? - " Idgham?" - Moughanna. - Excellent! What are you thinking, Wadjda? The fact that this competition is very difficult Colours me. I listened to the Quran radio yesterday. "The learning of the Quran difficult for you, God will reward you twice" Good. I want you all to look Wadjda as an example - - Someone who endeavors and is committed to God and His Prophet. - You are making progress. - Thank you, miss. Sorry. Wadjda, Miss Hussa said she wants to talk to you. Put the Quran. You will be surprised, but you remind me of myself at your age. And look at me now. Close the door. States you still think you did not do anything behind the school? Read magazines, did none of what you have in mind. Ask her. I'm not sure, miss. I was so far away. Thanks, Wadjda. You can go back. Give this folder to Miss Jamila. Close the door. This is a declaration. Sign in and you get to stay in school. In the name of God, I congratulate you all for your efforts this semester. I remind you that the school is a place of learning and morality. Listen carefully. Two students were found in the backyard when they committed a sin. The two are... Faten Khaled and Fatima Abdalla. To avoid similar things - - May you no longer bring flowers to school - - And do not give each other neither love letter or fan mail. And you can not hold hands. Have you understood? Then you can go back to your classroom. Your bags are there. Mommy! Do not touch me. I would like to have shorter here as Lubna Abdul Aziz. Cut it, then. Your dad loves my long soft hair. Mom saw the lights but forgot to ask me about them again She does not know if the lights? And your dad? I think they like your uncle now that he's been in the Quran Radio. - I bleed. - Where does the blood? What a shame! From my lap. How many times can I say that bikes are not for girls. Think you can do as boys? And you? Why did you let her ride a bike? Come back! Bring your bike! To your uncle to learn to behave. Up to you. You should be ashamed of coming here with a boy, when no one is home. Did dad know, he would kill you. Do you want the men to hear you? Remove the bread from the oven. Oh, how nice! They are impressed. You always make me so proud. Hope it is good enough for you. Turki, Saleh Ali Abdurahman. Abulazziz, Rashed, Abdalla. My dad... Interested in dad's amazing family tree? You are not. It is only men's name is written there. Clean up after yourself. Hide traces of your crime. I do not want him to be mad at us again. WADJDA Give me the photo. "I said ' give here." Stop it. What is going on here? - Salma has the photos of their wedding. - Congratulations. May I see the photos? In those from your wedding? Is it your husband? - How old is he? - Twenty. Quiet, girls. Do not laugh. Photos are prohibited at school. Now we start. The chapter on women, page 97. Wadjda, start reading from verse 115. - I will try to learn by heart. - Fine! Close Quran and start. " But as for guidance disobeys the Messenger" - " And do not take the believers' way " - - "He sounds We go where he wants to go and then we let him " - - " Burn in hell - which wretchedly goal!" Amazing! But you have to work on your reading and Tajwid - recitation. If you are aiming to win you must recite as Salma. Salma, read verse 115 again. " But after guidance has been made clear to him sits up " - - "Against the Messenger and want to go a different path than the believers ' - - "He sounds We go where he wants to go and then we let him " - - " Burn in hell - which wretchedly goal!" "God does not forgive those who put the aide on His side." " But He forgives whom He wills his minor sins." "Whoever puts aide on God's side " - - " Has pushed sin to its limits." Excellent. - Are you mad at me now? - I have homework to do. Wait a minute. Here, for your bike. Such as you have seen on TV. Want to ride a little? Behind the tent. We have a while before people come. Abdalla, look! The shopkeeper told Khalid and his father that the bike is reserved. He keeps it safe for me. The correct answer. Choose the correct answer. What are sabianerna? I know the answer. The correct answer. Finally! "You've never listened to me. Why should I listen to you?" Get dressed, we're going to go out. Do not let the Qur'an be open. The devil can spit in it. Work with Leila? Cool lab coats, as in "The Matrix," but whites. Quiet, I'll just give her a thing. Wadjda! Hello and welcome. Leila, why do you hide not your face? Never mind! Let me get an application form for you. Welcome! - How are you? - Fine, thank you. Great job and soon no places left. You should... Leila, stop. I just wanted to say hi I'll call you later, you are busy. - Take care of yourself. - Where are you? Take care of yourself. - If you do not work with Leila? - Stop it. "Among His signs is that He created for you wives of your own kind.." - "..That ye may dwell in tranquility with them." - No honey, try this. Listen. "... And He has put love and mercy between you." " In that are signs for those who reflect." I'm so shy. I can not recite so for everyone. You, shy? If only it were true. Look, there's Daddy! - Where? - There! There! Do you love him? - Who? Your father? - No, the boy next door. I do not think it's me who is in love with the boy next door. That was not fun. You did not answer. Do you love him? Dear children, I went to high school when he proposed to me. All the girls were crazy when they saw the photo of him. They were so jealous. The first man in my life. Hopefully also the last. You are beautiful. When he looks at you in the red dress he gets a heart attack. Do not worry. He would never take a wife and break my heart. Let us recite for the race tomorrow. The words should come from the heart. Ignore those around you and read from the heart. I'd like to be there tomorrow and make sure you win. But I have to commute to the end of the world again. Generosity? Wrong answer. Next. What does " sadakatouhonn "? - Wedding Gift? - Right. Salma. What is " Al-Furkan "? - Quran? - Right. Wadjda. What does " da'ab "? Custom. Right. Noura. What does " zaygh "? Weakness. Right. Next. What does " hawban kabiran "? I'm sorry, Yasmin. Go back to your seat. What does " hawban kabiran "? Something big? Wrong. Go back to your seat. - What does " hawban kabiran "? - Great injustice. Right. "If we had ordered them this: "'Kill yourselves' "or" Get out of your homes ' "They have not done, except a few of them." "If they had done what they exhorted..." "This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt" "This is a guide for the righteous," "who believe in the unseen" "and do prayer" "and spend, what We have given them." "Those who..." "Those who..." "Those who..." Thank you, Salma. God bless you. Wadjda. Verse 7, "Sur'at Al-Baqarah" Starting on "God has sealed their hearts..." "God has sealed their.." "God has sealed their hearts and their ears and covered over their eyes" " A severe punishment awaits them." " There are people who say: 'We believe in God ' " - - " ' And the Last Day ' though they do not believe." "They are trying to deceive God and the believers." " But they deceive none but themselves and do not realize it." " Their hearts are sick and God lets their disease getting worse" - - " and a painful punishment awaits them for their constant lies." "When they are urged not to sow discord on Earth, they answer" " We just want to improve and make amends." " No, it is they who create discord and spreads depravation." "But they do not realize." It was excellent, Wadjda. God bless you. Will you pray your prayer next to us? - Congratulations. - The winner is yet to be appointed. You won. Their favorite. All voted safely on you. Wadjda, come here! We kept a place for you in the front row. Coward. In the line. Stand closer together. Leave no room for the devil. God is great. God hears the prayer of thanks. Quiet, girls. Silence! Finalists in the competition. Noura Saleh, Salma Abdul Aziz and Wadjda Al Saffan. And now... the third prize goes to... Salma Abdul Aziz. Congratulations. Winner of the second prize is... Noura Saleh. Congratulations, Noura. Wadjda, the first prize goes to you. You won thanks to your dedication and that you have been so diligent. I hope everyone here today learn from your example. Congratulations. And what do you intend to use prize money for? I want to buy a bike at the store down the street. What did you say? I want to buy a bike, but without training wheels because I can ride a bike. Were well better to donate money to our brothers in Palestine? A bike is not for girls. Especially not for the benefit of girls who are afraid of their honor. I'm sure your family will not allow it. The money will be donated in your name and May God reward you for the good work. Now go back to your place. It's all girls. You can go now. So nothing's changed after all. You think you can behave anyhow unnoticed? Your stupid behavior will haunt you forever. You mean like your "fancy" thief? Won you not? Where is the money? In Palestine. - I give you my bike. - How can we ride up? Wadjda... You know I want to marry you when we grow up, right? So you're finally home. - What's the new haircut? - Your mother does not answer the phone. Can I see? You won? I do not think that's true. You are my little darling. Why are you crying? You won after all. - Wait a second. - Hello? Are you ready? I'm so proud of you, my little heroine. I have tried to call my mom all day. When she comes home, tell her I love her. Hello? Hello, Aunt Leila. No, I do not know where she is. Yes, she used to be home at this time. Okay, I'll say it to her. Goodbye. Congratulations, I heard the news. They said you won. I did not believe it was true. When you go in for something, no one can stop you. - I did not get the money. - Why say you wanted to buy the bike? But you do not need them and their money. What happens at home with grandma? Uncle marries well next month? This is not your uncle's wedding. It's okay. He has made his decision. It's just you and me now. We buy the red dress and go there and fetch father. The dress is no longer needed. In addition, I spent the money. I hope it is right. The shopkeeper had held it for a brave little girl. I want you to be the happiest person. You're all I have left in this world. - Abdalla. - Goal! Catch me if you can. SubText: NoRMITA.326
