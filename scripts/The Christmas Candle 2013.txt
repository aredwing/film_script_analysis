Legend has it a certain man came to live in the village of Gladbury. He was a good-hearted man, devoted to his family and his craft. The candle maker brought light to the entire village. But he longed to give them more. Life was hard in Gladbury, and the people had become disheartened. [NARRATOR] Night and day, the candle maker worked, pouring his heart and his prayers into each candle. But on the first Sunday of Advent, all he had left to give... was a single prayer, not for himself, but for Gladbury, for his son, and for all the sons and daughters to come. Silence was the only answer he would receive that night. Or so it seemed. [NARRATOR] An angel blessed a single candle. The heavenly gift was given to the ones who needed it most, with the simple instruction: Light this and pray. [NARRATOR] The children hoped for an answered prayer. But what they received was a miracle. On Christmas Eve, the village rejoiced upon hearing of their change of fortune, for such things do happen. And from them, legends are born. As the tale is told, every twenty-five years, the angel visits The Haddington Chandlery, and every time a prayer is answered. But even the greatest stories must come to an end. Much has changed in two hundred years. In a world illuminated by modern marvels, who needs the light of a simple candle? [bustling about and voices] [YOUNG BOY] I'm starving. [ABNER] How are you'! Hello. [ABNER] How we doing'! Alright? [DAVID] Yeah, very good, yeah. Hope they'll be bringing some more soon. [ABNER] Bless you little lady. [GIRL] ls it soup again'! [ABNER] God bless you, sir. [MISS FOSTER] There's no longer a place for you here! [RUTH] Please! [MISS FOSTER] I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do. Orders came straight from the top. [MISS FOSTER] You should learn to keep your affections to yourself, Ruth Goodchild! [MISS FOSTER] And don't even think about coming back! [WOMAN PASSERBY] Serves you right. [Ruth begins to weep] Abner, will you take over for a second? Yes. God bless you, sir. [Ruth weeping] Hello, miss. Miss. What do you want'! I only mean to help. [DAVID] It's no Buckingham Palace, Miss Goodchild. But you'll be safe here. And with three meals a day, you won't go hungry. When the baby comes, what then'! Well, perhaps there's someone... No.There's nobody. Or rather there was, but he found someone else and dismissed me from work today. [DAVID] Don't lose hope, miss. We'll find a place for you and your baby. [ABNER] God bless you, sir. [LADY CAMDON] Reverend Richmond? Friend of yours? I have no idea. God bless you. Reverend David Richmond. So you really have left the pulpit. Nonsense.This is my pulpit now. Soup, soap, and salvation. And please, I'm only known as David here. Have we met? We might have, had you not rejected my last three letters. Ah, yes, Lady Camdon of Gladbury, in the flesh. But I'm sorry that you've traveled so far only to hear me decline your offer once again. My place is here, helping the needy. You, sir, have you heard this man preach? Can't say that I have. [LADY CAMDON] Villagers flocked to London to hear him. I once sat by a fisherman who rode his boat twelve miles for one sermon. It was along time ago. But I'll never forget. David Richmond, miracle man. In the midst of my own great loss, it was your words that revived my faith. Any able bodied man can serve a bowl of soup, but few men have a gift like yours. My only hope is that you choose to serve where your gift is needed most. God bless you. [BOY] Thank you very much, sir. [ABNER] Perhaps you should think about it, David. [ABNER] God bless you.Well done, sir. [ABNER] That's it, take a bowl. Sorry. [DAVID] Dear Lady Camdon, your recent visit was a timely reminder of the life I left behind. Though tragedy has altered my course, I can no longer stray from my calling in the pulpit. I humbly accept the offer to serve your parish in the place of the late Reverend Pillington. I shall arrive in Gladbury the Friday before Advent. Yours truly, David Richmond. [EMILY] Come on, boy! Come on! Move on! You silly old thing. Come on! Move on! Come on! Might I offer you some assistance? Thank you, I'm quite capable! Well, if it wouldn't be too forward of me, I could-- [EMILY] No! I'm not a sack of potatoes. Come on! [EMILY] Come on, boy. Come on! [EMILY] I don't need your help. [DAVID] Come on. Come on. Come on. [DAVID] And where are you headed, miss'! Miss Barstow. I'm headed to London by way of Gladbury. And the people of Gladbury, they allow a lady to venture on her own'! It's the Christmas season. The whole town's in a fuss. [DAVID] But Christmas isn't for weeks. [EMILY] I take it you've never been to Gladbury. Is it really so bad? It is. [DAVID]Whoa, steady boy. Come on! Come on, come on, come on! Whoa.Whoa. [EMILY] Especially this Christmas with the new minister set to arrive. Reverend High and Mighty from London. I hope they dislike him very much. Thank you. I hate to be indebted to anyone, much less a stranger. It's an easy debt to forgive. "Reverend High and Mighty" at your service. Reverend. How providential. Oh, we shall see. Might you have any words of advice? Yes. Retreat. Walk on. Very well then. I look forward to seeing you at church on Sunday! [Emily laughs] Walk on. [EDWARD] Thank you Ebenezer. REM Hurry up, Edward. We don't want the new minister thinking the Haddingtons are a pair of village bumpkins. Codswallop my dear, you look lovely. I come from a long line of bumpkins, and I'm proud of it. Who wouldn't love Gladbury at Christmas? [MAN] He's here! [GIRLS] There he is! [villagers greet David] [crowd gasps] Hello. [HERBERT] Alright gentlefolk, make some space. Oh here, allow me. Herbert Hopewell, at your service. Me and the Missus'll be looking after you. [DAVID] Oh.Thank you, but I can manage. Not while I'm still breathing. Reverend Richmond, welcome to Gladbury. I'm Bea Haddington, and this is my Edward. Edward Haddington. Of Haddington Chandlery. Home of the Christmas Candle...'! Um. Oh, you haven't heard of us. That's alright, you'll have a chance to meet the reverend soon enough. Lovely to see you. All of you! Let's see the church, eh? [church bells ring] [organ playing] [ELEANOR] On a starry night in Bethlehem, A child was born to bring light to men. And our faith waned, our eyes grew dim In a candle's light we found hope again. There are miracles all around, Are you alright? [HERBERT] There she is, a special soul. Miracles yet to be found. Sometimes I think I'm hearing an angel. Hid in every heart is an answered prayer. That's my lady... Eleanor. Like a candle': flame, hope will lead us there. [ELEANOR] Off with that muddy coat! Did you crawl all the way from London? [ELEANOR] Come on, britches too. You're not the first clergyman I've seen in his underpants. [Herbert laughs] [Eleanor giggles] [ELEANOR] I'll just get these cleaned up. [Eleanor giggles] Were just across the garden if you need us. Anything at all. Welcome to Gladbury, Reverend. Jesus said, "Ye are the light of the world." A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. [parishioner coughs] Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, But on a candlestick. And it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men. That they may see your good works. And glorify your Father, which is in Heaven. Thank you Reverend. Is he talking about our Christmas Candle? I think he's gettin' to it. [DAVID] You sir! Would you hide this candle under a bushel? No sir, I wouldn't. Of course not. And you, Mrs. Haddington? Would you conceal this candle under your hat? Lovely as it is. [BEA] No, no, never. [DAVID] Candles belong on candlesticks, giving light to everyone. [DAVID] What then is this light that draws men to our Heavenly Father? Is it signs and wonders'! Angels and miracles? [DAVID] Of course not! [93335] [DAVID] It is our good works that shine before men and glorify our Father in Heaven. No. Not one word about the Christmas Candle. Better luck next time. [LADY CAMDON] Reverend Richmond. Lady Camdon. What a fascinating sermon. Thank you. And yet so unlike the sermons for which you're loved. That's not to worry you, Reverend. You'll do very well here in Gladbury. I'll make sure of it. [DAVID] "An early Christmas gift for you and all of Gladbury." This is quite unexpected. A gift from the Countess of Gladbury! Whatever could it be? Whatever could it be, eh? Gladbury': most beloved Advent sermons. Tried and true. [HERBERT] Some of these sermons are two hundred years old. And I imagine her ladyship expects me to use these sermons. Well, I can think of no better way to preserve the legacy of the Christmas Candle. Forgive my ignorance, but what is this Christmas Candle? I think you'll find everything you're looking for in here. [DAVID] This is preposterous! I thought you might stop by, Reverend. Tea? Had I known that the people of this town were expecting to hear such fairy tales from the pulpit, I never would have come! The Christmas Candle is no fairy tale, I assure you. [DAVID] Oh, then I suppose that you have seen this magical wish granting angel'! No. But he has. [DAVID] Ah, yes, the candle maker. Do I have some questions for you. Why one Christmas Candle, and not fifteen? Why doesn't this angel come once every year? Or every Thursday afternoon for tea? And why in all of God's green Earth, Gladbury'! [EDWARD] Why Bethlehem? Why a babe in a manger? Who could possibly hope to understand the ways of the Lord'! But I see no reason to promote superstitions or raise false hopes. [LADY CAMDON] People of Gladbury lead difficult lives. Even the slightest hope of a miracle keeps their faith alive. Only to be crushed when their prayers go unanswered. If this is what your people need, then I-- [LADY CAMDON] What our people need is hope. And you can give it to them. I know this firsthand. Lady Camdon, I'm not the "miracle man" that you remember. Coming to Gladbury was a mistake. [EDWARD] On that we are in agreement. [LADY CAMDON] But what if it were providence that brought you here? I think you should stay. [EDWARD]Why prolong the inevitable? Just until Christmas. [LADY CAMDON] This is the year. Please, David, consider it. [VICTORIA] Let's go play in the garden. [BOY] Victoria, wait for me! [DAVID] I take it you're not much of a horsewoman. [EMILY] If it isn't the ever-helpful reverend. [DAVID]Well that depends on who you're asking. I fear I have little to offer the people of Gladbury. [EMILY] Don't pity yourself, Reverend. Though I did warn you. This town is mad. [DAVID] All their hopes wrapped up in one candle. Oh, not just any candle, the Christmas Candle. [DAVID] Miss Barstow, do I detect an air of skepticism. [EMILY]The Christmas Candle': no different than old wives' tales or your Bible stories. Take no offense, Reverend. So you're not a believer then'! I'm a believer... in common sense. If something seems too good to be true, then most likely it is. They'll find out soon enough. In fifty years, will anyone know what a candle is'! Doubtful, we've already stepped into the Modern age in my father's shop, and I must say, it's electrifying. "London Lamp 8' Electric"? [EMILY] The bane of Edward Haddington': existence. And worse, founded by his very own son. Of course. Thomas Haddington. He's the Haddington': only child, So the fairy tale ends with him. [DAVID]What's this for'! ls this for the Christmas tree'! I envy him. He left Gladbury when he had the chance. You'd be wise to do the same. [DAVID] And what about you'? [EMILY] My time will come. When Father's health improves and he can manage on his own. [DAVID] Perhaps we'll find ourselves In London next Christmas. [EMILY] If you make it out of Gladbury intact. Oh come all ye faithful. Joyful and triumphant. Oh come ye oh come ye to Bethlehem. Come and behold Him, Born the king of angels. Oh come let us adore Him. Oh come let us adore Him. Oh come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord. [citizens talking and moving about] [WILLIAM] You must be the new Reverend. I'm William Barstow. Illness kept me from church on Sunday, but I've heard about you. Oh? My daughter told me the new reverend is more than eager to lend a helping hand, even if it does mean wading through mud. Oh yes, the spirited Miss Barstow. [WILLIAM] I've prayed for something to bring my Emily back to the church. Here's hoping it's you. [WILLIAM] Do you have your request? Go on then. [WILLIAM] My nephew's a special boy. Lots of faith.Wants to be a preacher, like you. [crowd oohs and awws] [EDWARD] Ladies and gentlemen! Gentlefolks of Gladbury, welcome to this very special night. Now feast your eyes on the amazing, wondrous, mystical visions bestowed on generations of Haddingtons. Gladbury': very own Christmas Candle! [EDWARD]There's a story that's been passed down for centuries from father to son. On the first Sunday of Advent, my great-great-great-grandfather was awakened by a wondrous light. [WILLIAM] Poor boy's parents died a few years back. We all have our stories. [WILLIAM] Everyone here is holding out for the Christmas Candle. [crowd oohs and awws] And where's your request? Oh, I couldn't possibly. I'd much rather Charlie receive the Candle. [WILLIAM] Will you be joining us? [DAVID] Not tonight. I believe I have a sermon to prepare. [EDWARD] And so he gave the first Christmas Candle to orphan children with Gladbury': most beloved instruction: light this and pray. [ELEANOR] Hid in every heart is an answered prayer. Like a candle': flame, hope will lead us there. Yes, yes, I know the song. But we won't be singing it today. It's the first Sunday in Advent, we sing it every year. But it's tradition. Well, we'll just make some new traditions, eh? We're just grateful we've got a reverend in the pulpit. Well, I hope you won't refuse my lady's other favorite Christmas tradition. Gladbury': very own Christmas Chasuble. Welcome. The first candle of Advent is the candle of hope. But hope in what? An answered prayer? A miracle? A Christmas Candle? I'm told that tonight marks the return of this remarkable tradition. Isn't that right Mr. Haddington? Yes, it is. [DAVID] And I'm sure that you know this, But for my benefit, who here has put in a request for the candle? [DAVID]Well, surely not everyone can receive the Christmas Candle. And yet we all have needs. So what hope do we have? Will we abandon our faith? Fall into despair? Hm'! I hope not. And I dare say that we will not! We light this candle to remind us that our hope does not come from earthly things, but from above. From the God who came to us one starry night in Bethlehem, and promises to come again one day. And that, good people of Gladbury, is miracle enough. [93335] God bless you. [EDWARD] Ignore him, dear. Ah, Mr. Barstow. And if it isn't the future reverend. I understand that we'll be hearing your sermons one day. Do you have a favorite scripture? Uh-- Go on, don't be shy. [WILLIAM] Charlie reads his Bible every day. [EMILY] Charlie! Poor boy would do anything for that candle. [WILLIAM] Hasn't been able to say a word since his parents died. [chaotic chatter] [WOMAN] Mrs. Haddington! [MAN] Take my request! [MAN] Has he been yet, sir? What are we going to do? Wish the candle came with a name attached. What if we already know? What? The candle.What if we already know who should get it? But we can't! It's going to take a miracle, Bea. I mean,Thomas has been gone for ten years! He's not going to come home on his own. Keeping the Christmas Candle for ourselves is so selfish! Is it? I mean, think of the people. For two hundred years, our family has been alight to Gladbury. Does the flame go out with us? Keep the Christmas Candle? For the good of Gladbury. Edward! [dramatic ethereal music] [blast] Well don't look at me! Get the candle! [EDWARD] Oh yes, yes of course! [Edward trips] [Bea cries out] [BEA] Why, Edward! [EDWARD] I couldn't see! It must be here somewhere. It must be. Must be here. Where is it? Where is it? Oh Edward! Where is it? Oh! I've lost the Christmas Candle. Oh surely this is God punishing us. [BEA] Oh don't talk like that, Edward. I was--I was foolish to think that candle was ours. Is it all clear? [BEA] Seems to be. [BEA] Edward! The reverend is here! Hide the candles! [DAVID] Mr. Haddington. Mrs. Haddington. [BEA] What a pleasant surprise. [DAVID] I imagine your night was eventful. So is it here? The Christmas Candle? Yes, yes it's here somewhere. Bea, Bea. Of course you're not going to show it to me, but that's not why I came. The people's requests for the candle... ...may I see them? [BEA] What do you suppose he intends to do with them'! [EDWARD] I don't know. Pray'! That's what we should be doing. We've got to make it better, Bea. Yes, but how? [DAVID] All done. Thank you. You may have one candle to give, but I hope to give everyone a little light this Christmas. That's it! What? I mean... that's a lovely idea. Well, you mustn't delay. So much to be done before Christmas. Good day to you. [BEA] Yes, yes, God speed to you on your quest. What's got into you? We give them away. All of them. And have the entire village think they've got the actual Christmas Candle? We won't tell them that. We'll tell them what this family has told them for generations: to light it and pray. But this is Gladbury. People talk. Edward, somebody': miracle is in this basket. And we won't let it go to waste! [WILLIAM] Charlie, the reverend has offered to give you Bible lessons. [William coughs] [DAVID] Hello, Charlie. Why don't we start with the Gospel of John chapter one. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehend it not." "And the impediment to his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly." Now Charlie, we are going to loose that tongue of yours. Open wide. And... [DAVID] Very good. And... Louder. [nonsensical sounds] Louder. [knock at window] Light this and pray, Charlie. Even if it's only in your heart. God will hear you. [DAVID] Good morning, Mr. Finch. What brings you to our home? [DAVID] I understand you have requested the candle. I wondered if I might be of service. Reverend, meet my family. My wife, Delilah. Hello. [PHINEAS] Children. This is my father, Oliver. [OLIVER] The new reverend! [PHINEAS] Over here, Dad. Come on. Don't suppose you could help the old man get his hands on the Christmas Candle? Maybe put in a word to the Haddingtons. [OLIVER] Hogwash. The next time I see, I hope to be looking at the Good Lord himself. In the meantime, I'll walk by faith, right Reverend? Right. Oh thank you.Thank you so much! It'll be a happy Christmas after all! Remember, children, this is our little secret. Reverend Richmond! Do come in. I've been praying for company, Reverend. [DAVID] Why waste a prayer when I can meet the need? So you'll find me a knitting companion? I... shall. [KIDS] Coming! Don't waste a candle on an old man like me. Oliver, there's no such thing as a wasted prayer. [MRS. BICKERTON] My stove doesn't work, and my husband ran off and left me all on my own with a colicky baby. Oh, and then yesterday the wall fell down, and my goat left me, too. I shall keep an eye out... for both of them. The Reverend fixing our roof. We so desperately need it. Speaking of which, Agnes, my dumpling, hadn't you a request? [DAVID] Ah, yes, Miss Agnes Chumley. But I see it is an unspoken request. Well, go on. A silent request is no request at all. I'm praying for a husband. By Easter. Mrs. Haddington. What brings you here? [BEA] I've come to let you know that your request has been heard. Oh what a dear, but I couldn't accept. That handsome young reverend has been helping me. [BEA] I see. [BEA] Agnes, dear, light this and pray. Mother! It's the devil's work! [WIDOW LEONARD] You tell her, Reverend. It's unnatural. What'! Ungodly. Yes. [DAVID] And the light shineth in Gladbury, and yet the people comprehend it not. [Emily laughs] [EMILY] Make fun all you want, you've decided to stay here. Just long enough to do some good. I have a letter to post for London. Ruth Goodchild. To a lady no less. [DAVID] Yes, she's a guest of the Salvation Army in a difficult situation. She's just a girl really. Stockings. Sweets. May I help you? I'm looking for, well, uh, a lot of things actually. [EMILY] Sardines. Thank you. Soap. String. It's alphabetical. I see. [DAVID] Well, to do much, one must be organized. You really do want to help these people, don't you'! Of course I do. [church organ] [DAVID] Welcome everyone. We light the second candle of Advent in the love of God. During Advent, God pierces the darkness of the world with divine light and love. Because he loved us, he sent his son to light the way. Though we must wait for Christmas day, we must not wait to love one another as Christ did. Does your neighbor need a miracle this Christmas? Well why not be that miracle? [mumbling in crowd] [MR. COLLINS] Reverend! Hello Mr. Collins. Thought maybe you could use a hand. You know, "be the miracle." [DAVID] Ow. Where did he come from? [EDWARD] Reverend. [BEA] Happy candle. Christmas! [DAVID] And to you. [EDWARD]Why'd you have to say that. Come on. [BEA] I'm so sorry. [DAVID]The prodigal goat has returned. Thank you. Oh, you won't believe it! The neighbors are building me a new wall. [metal clanging] Here he comes. Shh. [metal clanging] [DAVID] How does it feel? Feels... it feels a lot like seeing! See Reverend, you are a miracle worker. [DAVID] Hello. That's a lot of food, Reverend. Well, you have a lot of mouths to feed. That's beautiful. Another visitor, I-- Hello everyone. [DAVID] Um,Widow Leonard just brought us a feast! Please,join us Reverend. [DAVID] Why not? [WIDOW LEONARD] I know we fast during Advent and save the feasting for Christmas day, but having company, that's like Christmas to me. Gladbury': Christmas pudding. [BEA] Light this and pray. [EDWARD] Light this and pray. [prayers spoken aloud, fading in and out] [VOICE] Amen. [VOICE] Amen. [GROUP] Amen. [DAVID] Rejoice, for today we light the third candle of Advent, the candle of joy. When Christ was born, God used angels to proclaim "good tidings of great joy." To all mankind. Now, we are the messengers of this good news. For with every good deed, every act of kindness, Christ is born again and again in our lives. Now let us go forth, as joyful messengers, doing the work of God. Your work in this town is impressive, Reverend Richmond. Thank you, Lady Camdon. Still there are limits to what man can do. [MRS. CHUMLEY] Reverend. Reverend. Mrs. Chumley. Miss Chumley. How lovely to see a sister in the Lord. Well go on my dear, what have you to say? I've already made my wishes known to the Reverend. And now I'm taking a step of faith. Thank you. [DAVID] Another prayer that will never be answered. Well, I for one am happy to see that In spite of all your efforts, you are still inspiring hope for a miracle. Come in. [DAVID] Mrs. Hopewell. A friend of mine may be coming to Gladbury for a while. I wondered if she might stay with you and Herbert. [ELEANOR] She can stay as long as she likes. [DAVID] Thank you! Her name's Ruth. My colleague Abner will bring her from London. Oh, please, allow me. [ELEANOR] This is no job for a reverend. [DAVID] Nonsense. [ELEANOR] This is no job for a lady. Mrs. Hopewell. Whatever is the matter? No, I won't do it. [DOCTOR] Herbert, you're one good shock away from the grave. I'll get plenty of rest in Heaven. Herbert. [DOCTOR] Which may not be that far off. You've got a weak heart. I have a strong faith. God will either cure me, or He'll call me home. [ELEANOR] Of course he will, but you have to rest. [DOCTOR] No more carrying heavy boxes, climbing ladders, or chopping wood. Do you hear me? But that's my job! I will chop the wood. No. No m'lady, I won't have it. Please. Pray for him, Reverend. [DAVID] Certainly. Our Father in Heaven, please grant your servant Herbert with the good sense to follow the doctor's orders and get some rest. [DAVID] I've had enough of Herbert hauling crates of candles. Besides, it's high time that Gladbury see the light. [EMILY] Electricity... In the church. For too long the church has stumbled about in the dark ages, when it should be lighting the way. In fact, I believe that the church should be the first place to embrace the future. Indeed. Now this I have to see. [DAVID] Miss Barstow, does this mean that you'll finally be coming to church? [Emily laughs] Twenty-nine prayers. And only one can be answered. You mean thirty, dear. Thirty candles. No, I'm certain there were twenty-nine. [EDWARD] Bea, there were thirty candles hanging the night of the angel's visit. There're always thirty candles. Twenty-nine! Bea, a candle is-- Don't say it Edward, please don't say it out loud. We've lost the candle. [hammering and voices] I'm curious to know the maximum number you've ever installed. [ELECTRICIAN] About twenty. [DAVID] Then I want thirty. No, thirty-five bulbs. I question the safety of it. The circuit can only support so many watts, Reverend. [DAVID] Then install another circuit. Install five circuits. I want the light in this church to surpass the brightness of one thousand candles. [HERBERT] Reverend Richmond, could you tell me why there are men digging in the church yard, and fiddling in our sanctuary walls. You leave that. My grandfather carved that altar. [DAVID] Herbert! I ordered them here to install electricity. Electricity? Electricity is the future. And a more practical one at that. Practical you say'! How will our treasury stand this extravagance? Don't trouble yourself, Mr. Hopewell. I've covered the cost personally. Consider it my contribution to a brighter chapter of Gladbury': history. I plan to unveil the electricity at the coming nativity service. Herbert, your heart. Sit down, love. Aye. [DAVID] Please, think of this with an open mind. Think of Herbert. No cumbersome candles or lanterns to change. You of all people should see the value in that. [ELEANOR] You could use a lighter load. L...What'll I do with all the Haddington candles? Well, I... I imagine that we can return them. In fact, that's the task that I'll gladly take on. [BEA] Oh, it's got to be here somewhere. Edward! I have a feeling Edward. I have a feeling this is the one. The Christmas Candle. What are you suggesting? I'm not suggesting anything. I'm... asking. [knock at the door] Mr. Haddington. Reverend. I regret to inform you that St. Mark's no longer requires your candles. But that's a standing order. It has been for two hundred years. It's standing no more, I'm afraid. But I just delivered three crates. Yes,thank you, but we only need one. But... but-- [DAVID] Trust me when I say, it's for the good of Gladbury. [BEA] What does he know about the good of Gladbury? This is our legacy, and he's meddling with it. I say we light the candle right now. We've earned it. We're going to give this candle away. To whom'! [BEA] Of course. God bless you, sir. God bless you, ma'am. [WORKER] These are ready to go. [WORKER] Give us a hand. [typing] [BEA] Whatever will they think of next? [SECRETARY] May I help you? Um, we're here to see Thomas Haddington. And you are? We're his parents. We have a gift for our son. [SECRETARY] Mr. Haddington': away. But I'd be happy to receive it on his behalf. [EDWARD] Perhaps we could leave it for him. [EDWARD]You watch, Bea, he'll come home. ...of redeeming grace. Jesus, Lord at thy birth. Jesus, Lord at thy birth. In my short time in Gladbury, I have seen many miracles. I have seen angels at work. I have seen them on the rooftops, at kitchen tables, and in this very sanctuary. In fact, I see these angels now. Mr. Hardy Collins. Dear Ms. Leonard. Herbert Hopewell. And every single one of you who has allowed the light of Christ to shine through your good works this Advent season. From what I've read of Gladbury': past, this town has glowed with a certain miraculous light for generations. But today marks the dawning of a new age in Gladbury. [DAVID] It is my hope that in centuries to come, our beloved church will shine even brighter still. Ghastly. [WIDOW LEONARD] It's witchcraft! Witchcraft in the house of the Lord. [electrical shorts heard] [CHILD] Mummy! Daddy! Get the children! [DAVID] Everyone, please! Remain calm! [MRS. BICKERTON] Oh, my poor sweet baby Jesus. F-F-F-F Fire! Dorothy... Dorothy, get the boy out. [DAVID] Remain calm! [OLIVER] My hat! Please, everyone, remain calm! [HERBERT] No, my grandfather's altar! [DAVID] Herbert! [DAVID] Herbert! [DAVID] ls he going to be alright? [DOCTOR] He's dead. [EMILY] Reverend! Miss Barstow. It's my father. He's called for you. [EMILY] You're alright, Father. Reverend Richmond's arrived. Pray for me, Reverend. What ails you, Mr. Barstow? Dr. Clem': diagnosed Father with consumption. [EMILY] Said he's done all he can do. [WILLIAM] God'll do the rest. Right, Reverend? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [EMILY] Do you have anything to say for yourself'! I'm sorry, but I can't give your father what he's asking for. All he wants is-- I know what he wants. [EMILY] Then give it to him. You're a minister; he's a dying man. You can't give him a simple prayer? Look, if it's so simple, then why don't you do it? I don't believe in miracles. The fourth candle of Advent, our last before Christmas Eve, represents the peace of God, who passes all understanding. In the coming days of Christmas, let us be instruments of this peace, Shining light where there is darkness, hope where there is despair, sowing joy where there is sadness... ...and faith where there is doubt. You asked me to fill your pulpit, and instead I emptied your church. You mustn't take all the credit. I did ask you to come. I am a man of faith, Lady Camdon. I believe God worked in the appointed time. But in our modern age, the lame don't walk, blind men do not see, and the sick die. But sometimes they live. Walk with me, Reverend. [LADY CAMDON] Twenty-five years ago, our town suffered great hardship. That's when the Haddingtons gave The candle to Reverend Pillington. But when he lit the candle to pray... ...well, he nearly burned the vestry to the ground. The poor dear was in despair, and then, within the church walls, a treasure was discovered, several gold crosses and a ruby brooch. A hidden treasure? Well, had it not been for the fire, it would've remained hidden. And thankfully, there was just enough to repair the church And to provide for Gladbury's impoverished families that winter. The very first Christmas Candle went to my great-great-great-grandmother. Once she was a hopeless orphan, and then... Miracles are part of our inheritance, Reverend. Tell that to Mrs. Hopewell. I believe you'll find Mrs. Hopewell': faith to be much stronger than the grief she's feeling now. Your doubts don't trouble me, Reverend. On the contrary, they inspire my faith. [honk] [BEA] Edward, have a look at this! It's a carriage that pulls itself! In all my days... Bea! It's Thomas! It's Thomas. [THOMAS] Father. Mother. Oh, look at you, handsome and fancy! That carriage of yours! It's called a Stanley Steamer, one of the first of its kind. I had it shipped from America. [EDWARD] Shall I help you bring in your luggage? [THOMAS] Oh, I'm not staying, Father. Oh, not staying, don't be silly. I'm married, Mother. I'm on the way to meet her family now. Getting married. Name's Priscilla. She's the daughter of a baron. Oh! And, are you happy? I'm finally making a name for myself, for the family. Business is expanding, and one day I'll introduce you to Priscilla. Why did you come? I know how much this candle means to you, to Gladbury, but it's lost on me. You must light it and pray, and then you'll see. See what, Mother? A miracle? Gladbury needs you, son. The world needs me. I'm lighting up entire cities. It was good to see you. Both of you. [THOMAS] Merry Christmas. Thomas, the miracles, the angel, you saw it with your own eyes. I was a child. I saw what I wanted to see. Goodbye. [BEA] Thomas. Reverend. I would like to see your father. [William coughing] [EMILY] Father. Father. [DAVID] Mr. Barstow, if I may. [DAVID] And it came to pass that a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging, He cried, "Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me." And Jesus said unto him, "What wilt though that I should do unto thee?" The blind man said unto him, "Lord, that I might receive my sight." And Jesus said, "Go thy way; thy faith has made thee whole." And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way. Did I not say to you that if you would believe, You would see the glory of God. And they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying, and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard..." And these are written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that in believing, you might have life. Behold there came a leper and worshipped him, "Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean." And Jesus put forth his hand... My little daughter is at the point of death. I pray thee, Lord, come and lay hands on her, that she might be healed. If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him... The father of the child cried out, "Lord, I believe, help my unbelief!" And he said to her, "Damsel, arise." And they were astonished, a great astonishment. Speak the word, and my servant shall be here. And Jesus said unto them, "Thy faith has made you whole." David. David. He's asleep. [DAVID] My wife and daughter died of consumption. I prayed. I even believed for a miracle. [DAVID] But God did nothing. Oh, David. [DAVID] One day my faith was so certain, and then it was gone. There was a time when I could not... ...utter a prayer or step foot in a church. I believe I've made my peace with God. But still I was a different man before. The love I shared, the hope I had... Some things, they cannot be restored. I do hope you're wrong. Such a hope is too great a risk. But I wonder what you risk living without it. [DAVID] [weakly] I should go. [Emily sobs] Bea. He won't light it. I'll light it for him. It's of no use. Anyway, we don't even know if it's the right one. Well then we'll find out. We did everything we knew to do. We gave away every last candle, and this one came back. Twice. This could be our miracle, Edward. I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries, but I know just the person to give the candle to this year. David Richmond. Think of it, Edward. Your father gave the candle to Reverend Pillington. And as we know, David is a far greater wretch than he ever was. [BEA] You make a compelling argument, but I don't-- Don't tell me you've given the candle away. This is the candle, isn't it'! Splendid. Then we're in agreement? [BEA] Lady Camdon, I don't think-- [EDWARD]Yes, we'll give the candle to David. Good. [LADY CAMDON] Lord knows, he could use a little light. But he doesn't even believe in the candle. Edward. Edward, please! Mr. Haddington. May I have a word'! The Christmas Candle. You're giving the candle to me? [EDWARD]Well, you weren't the first choice. What am I to do with it. Just light it and... just light it. Just do something good for Gladbury. [DAVID] Emily. [DAVID] In church. And on your own accord. It's true. Am I to think that you've come to believe? I don't know. I want to. In times like this, it would be comforting. Don't think less of me. I have a problem. Cousin Charlie was given this blasted Christmas Candle, and the poor boy has given it to me. Who could refuse a gift like that? Now all I can do is pray. I feel as though I owe it to him. That is a problem. [banging on door] [EDWARD] Yes, yes, I'm coming. Reverend Richmond, Miss Barstow. [DAVID] Mr. Haddington, a word. Reverend! Miss Barstow! Is there a problem? [DAVID] On the contrary. A great and wondrous miracle has taken place this Christmas season. It seems that the angel has blessed not one, but two Christmas Candles this year. And now that I think of it, how small is my faith, to think that this angel might stop at two. Why not three or four? Or maybe there are no limits to the blessings the Good Lord might bestow upon Gladbury. [BEA] Well, we can explain. Edward tripped, and then-- you came around. There was an accident. Yes, we'd lost the candle. So I said, "Why don't we give all the candles?" Bea. And Edward said-- We meant no harm. But you've given us false hope. Surely you can see that. How could you? How could you question my intentions for the people of Gladbury when you, yourselves so blatantly misled them? I fear this Christmas will end in nothing but disappointment, And you and your fairy tales are to blame. [Bea gasps] Perhaps it was providence that kept me in Gladbury. Well, here we are again. [DAVID] Thank you, Mrs. Hopewell. I can never repay you. I know what it is to suffer a great loss. Allow me, Reverend. It's time. On Christmas Eve, we light the final candle of Advent, the Christ Candle, for only in Christ do we find the hope, love, joy, and peace that we have come to know this season. Christmas Eve holds a special place in the heart of every believer, and nowhere is this more true than in the town of Gladbury. Many of you have no doubt come to rejoice in the miracle of the Christmas Candle. But regretfully, tonight you shall see this long-standing tradition come to an end. [gasps] Father? I would now like to ask the recipient of the Christmas Candle to please stand. [murmurs] [DAVID] Now more than ever I see the urgent need to speak on the virtue of enduring faith, a faith that endures disappointment, and unanswered prayer. A faith that relies not on the hollow promises of men, but on the sovereignty of Almighty God. I... I... I've got something to say! [gasps and chatter] I can speak! [joyful voices] I prayed. Every day I prayed, And then I woke up this morning, and I could talk. I don't understand it. I even gave my candle away. But my favorite scripture says, "With God, all things are possible." Now I'm never going to stop talking, especially about this! [applause] I don't know how this happened, but my wife also received the Christmas Candle. For my husband. As many of you know, I was stuck on the bottle. Like never before, I prayed. And I found I was drinking less and less. Which really is a miracle. [applause] I was hopeless. I'd lost everything. And now, nothing': lost at all. It's all been found. [applause] [MR. FINCH] I've been out of a job for some time now, and found myself in debt up to my ears. But then, our landlady-- [MRS. FINCH] She forgave us our debts in full. [MR. FINCH] And if that wasn't enough, well I found work at the Leonard house. It makes a man feel good to provide for his family again. And my wife, she's found a good friend in Ms. Leonard. [MRS. FINCH] Yes, this dear woman, she's taught our kids to knit. [laughs and applause] [JOE] [on verge of tears] My name's Joe. I'm not really a religious man. I asked for the candle, and it's saved my cat. It may not seem much, but she means a great deal to me. I never thought I'd get the Christmas Candle, but thank God I did. [applause] [PHINEAS]The candle was for me old man, Oliver Barber. [DELILAH] He was blind. As you may have heard, dad died this morning. [DELILAH] And just before he left us, he whispered, "I can see." "I can see." His prayer was answered,just as he'd hoped. He saw Jesus. When I received the candle, I thought my prayer'd be answered one way, so I took a step of faith. Only it was in the wrong direction. But then I stumbled into the arms of Hardy Collins, the man of my dreams, and just this morning, he asked me to be his wife. [excited gasps] My answer's yes! [EMILY] I don't know what to say, except I prayed for my father, and here he is. [WOMAN] I hadn't spoke to my sister in ten years. I even stopped coming to church because of her. But we both received the candle... So Reverend, have you changed your mind about Gladbury? I'm afraid this has only confirmed my suspicions. How can you not believe? I believe... but I do not belong. [thunder] [applause] Quite a night. More than I could have imagined. I know he'll come back, Edward. Not tonight. Maybe not until after we've both gone, but I don't have to see it to believe that our son will come home again. [thunder] [DAVID] God help me in my unbelief. [thunder and wind] [ELEANOR] There are miracles all around, Miracles yet to be found. Hid in every heart is an answered prayer. [DAVID JOINS] Like a candle': flame, Hope will lead us there. [DAVID] When the darkness comes, Let the light shine through, A spark of faith will ignite in you. In a candle': glow, a Virgin's womb, In a simple prayer in the empty tomb. [BOTH] There are miracles all around. Miracles yet to be found. Hid in every heart is an answered prayer. Like a candle': flame, hope will lead us there. [door opens] Abner! It's Ruth!There's been an accident, The carriage overturned. We've got to hurry. She's about to have the baby. [DAVID]Where is she'! ls she alright? [ABNER] About a mile away. She needs a doctor. [DAVID] We can take Miss Barstow': cart. [EMILY] Come on, boy, come on! [DAVID] Come on! [DAVID] Abner, are you sure that this is the way'! [ABNER] Straight on, keep going. [DAVID] Whoa! Whoa! [DAVID] How much further is it? [ABNER] Just round the bend, where the road drops off. [EMILY] I'll come with you. I know these woods. [ABNER] I'll be ready with the horse. [DAVID] Have we made a wrong turn? [EMILY] I don't think so, there should be a clearing. [DAVID] How will we ever find her? [EMILY] That won't do us any good, not in this. [DAVID] It's one of the Haddington candles. [EMILY] I have three left. [DAVID] Try again. [DAVID]Wait! Please, God, keep Ruth safe. Help us find her. [DAVID] Try again. Please, God.We need a miracle. [EMILY] What's happening? [DAVID] A miracle is happening. [DAVID] Let's go. [DAVID] Let's go. [DAVID] Ruth! Ruth! Thank God we found you. [RUTH] Mr. Richmond. You're safe now. [baby cries] [CHARLIE] Faster, Uncle, faster! [DAVID] Dear Lady Camdon, [WILLIAM] Charlie... [DAVID] Every minister aspires to leave his mark on a parish, but truth be told, Gladbury has left its mark on me. In spite of my best efforts, I witnessed many miracles this Advent season. None more remarkable than my own change of heart. If you will have me, I will be honored to remain in Gladbury, for many Christmases to come. [DAVID] [to couple] Congratulations. [DAVID]Your miracle man, David Richmond. Ah, the Reverend Richmond. Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas to you. I don't quite know what to say, except for there's someone I'd like you to meet. [ELEANOR] Let me take that. [BEA] But you knew about this all along? I had an inkling, but I didn't know for sure until Ruth confirmed Thomas was the father. Are you ready? [DAVID] Come, meet your grandchild. Ruth, this is Mr. and Mrs. Haddington,Thomas' parents. I hardly know what to say. He has your eyes. Have you named him? I'd like to name him after my father. He looks like an Edward. Isn't that a fine name? May I? [BEA] Our grandson. Edward. [DAVID] Emily! I was hoping, uh... Yes; I was hoping that we might spend Christmas together. Your first Christmas in Gladbury. And your last. Gladbury has a funny way of keeping people. I used to mind it. I don't anymore. Forgive me.The moment seemed providential. [DAVID] Does this mean I'll be seeing you in church from now on? [Emily chuckles] On a starry night in Bethlehem, A child was born to bring light to men. And our faith waned, our eyes grew dim In a candle': light we found hope again. There are miracles all around, Miracles yet to be found. Hid in every heart is an answered prayer. Like a candle': flame, hope will lead us there. When the darkness comes, let the light shine through, A spark of faith will ignite in you. In a candle': glow, a Virgin's womb, In a simple prayer, in the empty tomb. There are miracles all around, Miracles yet to be found. Hid in every heart is an answered prayer. Like a candle': flame, hope will lead us there. When the light has dawned on Christmas day, We will lift our voice in endless praise. When the light has dawned on Christmas day, [we will say: There are miracles all around, miracles yet to be found. Hid in every heart is an answered prayer. Like a candle': flame, hope will lead us there.
