You hear me in your parents as your teacher, your friends, even as the rain and wind. What? Take this for me. All right. Stop it. Stairs after stairs, don't they have a lift? God, so many stairs! Eva, hurry up. You're so slow and stop sending SMS. Let's go. Save it. I need a facial later. You guys stop picking on her! Hey Mandy. You sure we've the permission to move here? Yes, they never let students move in here. Why did the supervisor agree? Go and ask Eva. Eva, can you stop for a minute? What? Mandy told him that... this is our last Summer here. And we want to live together. Oh yes, he told us to keep a lower profile. Don't let others know he treats us special. Those numbers are smaller. Room 13 should be over there. Let's go... This is it. So dusty. Open the windows. So dazzling. It's spacious. Yes. I want this bed. You sleep in that one. It's mine, no way. Come over. Eva, come over, you sleep here. You're so nice. You want the upper or lower bunk? Upper bunk. I'll take the lower bunk then. There's only one study desk. You use it. I'll be in the lab at night. Who drew this? So inconsiderate. How to wash it off? Only one wardrobe. What? That's not enough space for me. You've got another SMS? Are you on those SMS dating game? No What are you playing? Return these please. Ok. It's photo time. Let's see. One More? You've a new voice message. See you at the Ghost Tower, Rain. End of voice message. Eva: I'm waiting for you at Ghost Tower Eva. Eva, what are you doing? I want to take a photo in front of the Ghost Tower. Help me. Stop fooling around, let's go back. Rain, please. We'd better leave now. Thanks for your care all along. I'll never forget you. Don't you forget me too. What are you doing? You're acting strange lately. What's wrong? I... went into the Ghost Tower. No way. What for? It's just a deserted school hall. Nothing special. Aren't you studying for your exams? You should go back. And you? I'll walk around, will be back soon. Alright, be careful. (Welcome to the 19th level of Hell.) Students, exam will be over in 15 minutes. I'll be there. I'll always be with you. Eva. After open this door, you'll see what you desire. What you are hearing now... is belongs to you. We will see another door. Open it slowly. We will come back then. I'll count to 5. I don't get it. Dr. Yan, why do I see those things? It's simple. We will see things that we've never experienced in our minds. You're like a computer overloaded with information and need time to compress them and set yourself free. But philosophers all agree reality is what we've in our minds. Do you believe that? I do. Good. In our minds, we are able to create a false reality. Dr. Yan, how many times do I have to see you? Getting tired of me so soon? Of course not. Well, Rain. The school wants me to treat you, so you can forget the Eva incident. If so, the school should seriously investigate the incident, not like now. Sorry, your time is up for today. See you later. This way out. Violet, next. Yes sir. Are you okay? Mandy, It's your turn. Why don't you wait for me and we'll go back together. Hold on. Live at 9th floor? Rain. I've something to ask you. Was I really awful to Eva? Don't think that. Eva won't mind. Miss, where's Room 13? This one. You two were roommates in year one. But in year two, what happened between you two? Rain, I've never had any closed friends. Maybe I look too arrogant. When I first started college, Eva was the only one who talked to me. She's a chatterbox, loves to talk. That's her charm. I think Dr. Yan needs me. I've to go. You have one new message. Rain, help me, hurry up. Excuse me, have you seen a dog walk by? No. Thanks. It's unlock. Inspector Yip, your tie. You two know each other? I was a junior policeman then. But now I'm a senior inspector. I was in charge of the Eva case. You all are her good friends? Yes. I'll go check on her. Is she ok? I guess so. Thanks for your help before. Don't be silly, I didn't do much. But my supervisor... Let's forget it. Inspector Yip, is this your biscuit? Thanks. The report says you witnessed the suicide? I don't believe Eva would kill herself. Neither do I after I saw her photo. Try to recall, was there anything unusual before the incident? Yes, there is one thing. She asked me to take a photo outside the Ghost Tower for her. Ghost Tower? Rumors said it's haunted. There's no ghost in the world. Do you want to see the photo? Sure. There is a shadow in the photo. Where? What's wrong? Who touched my computer? It's probably a virus. Well, we found this phone on the body. Something's odd about that photo. You take a look. It's probably taken by her boyfriend. Boyfriend? But I didn't go in that day. So I don't know. Ok. What's her boyfriend's name? How can I find him? It was just a guess that she had a boyfriend. I've never seen her dating anyone. Ok. Then... I'll give you my number. Call me if you recall anything. Ok, write it here. I'm sorry. Do you know something? About Eva. You know something about Eva? What are you talking about? I know nothing. Put it here. Ok. L... B... B Mandy, it's late at night. What are you doing here? Monkey... What monkey? Shh... Monkey is behind you. There is no monkey. Why are you doing here? Where's Violet? There's a monkey. Mandy. (From Violet: Save me!) The number you called cannot be reached. The number you called cannot be reached. I... don't want to play anymore. No... Don't force me. No... Eva? It's impossible. (Do you know what 19th level looks like?) (Welcome to Hell) (Please select: 1 Ox Pit) (2 River of Netherworld 3 Forest of Mirrors) (4. Metal Tree Valley 5. Blood Pool.) (Enter or Exit) (Please follow the Hell Hound) (to the 1st Level.) (The entrance to River of Netherworld.) (Please select: Enter or Exit.) (Your choice'll lead you to a life of regret) (When you standing at the door,) (a hand will suddenly push you.) (You'll then fall into the black hole.) There's no way back. Violet. We need to cross this river to escape. What are you saying? This is the 1st Level: Hell of Tongue Extraction. How did you know that? Of course I do. If you feel guilty, you will die here. Boarding to the exit... Violet. If you want to find out how Eva died, board... If dad didn't die, mom wouldn't marry that pervert. He's always peeping at me. I wish him to die. I hate Mandy... Shut up. The sky is dull and foggy in March. Shut up... Eva is such a big mouth. She will tell others that I ran over an old lady. She would. Shut up. Once Eva is dead, no one will know. Don't say anymore... I really wish that pervert to die. I killed him. I didn't... He died in a fire when he was drunk. Violet! Violet! Stop! I want to save Violet! Stop the boat! Violet has fallen into Hell of Tongue Extraction. Violet will always suffer in hell. Who's this? Speak up. (You have one new message.) (You've passed 1st level of Hell.) (Proceed to 2nd level 3 days later.) Violet! Violet! Sir. Found this on the body. Okay. This number again? It's ok now. Let me do it. Relax. Yes Sir. Rain, were you guys playing some game? Game? You must be in shock. Wear it. Our initial investigation indicates that it's suicide case. I know she's your good friend. Don't be too upset. We found her phone. The last message says "game over". (No message.) What's wrong? A regular phone SIM card. There are some pebbles in her stomach. Mandy... Do you know about the 19th Level of Hell? Are you playing that game too? I saw a monkey laughing at me. What monkey? Are you hallucinating? Not a hallucination. Rain, do you think I'm crazy? I'm not. I'm just scared. About what? Follow me... Come here... Kneel down... At the last summer of high school, our teacher took a trip with us. We went to China via Macau. When we were dining at a restaurant, there was a dish called spicy steamed tofu. We found out it was monkey brain... after dinner. And there was a car accident when we got back the next day. I survived. But I still very scared. It's been 4 years. I've never told anyone in college. Why are you telling me now? Cause I know there'll be retribution for me. It'll be back for revenge. In these few days, I've seen that monkey couple of times. He was out at the window laughing, kept on laughing at me. Very scary... Stop thinking about this. How could that monkey get here? Plus you didn't know before you ate it. So if I knew it beforehand, I'd deserve to die? That's right. It'll be me three days later... Let me see your phone. What do you want? You've been sending SMS constantly. That's my business. Mandy... Sorry, have we met? I'm Gao Yuan, a Fine Arts major. What's wrong? Are you not feeling well? Rain. How do you know my name? Because of those two incidents, everyone knows your name here. I'm sorry. I just want to ask you as my model. Sorry, I don't want to. Bye. If someone wants to follows me, let him sacrifice himself. Carry his cross and follow me. Those who wants to save his life will lose his life. Those who lose their lives for God will survive. Man can gain the whole world but lose himself. What good does it bring? What can a man do for an eternal life? In this world of sin and evil, those who laugh at our beliefs, the Jesus, with His glory and the arrival of the angels, we'll laugh at last. Thanks Dr. Yan for sharing the gospel. Eva and Violet are with our Lord. Let's bow our head in silence. Aren't four of us good friends? Why do they only leave messages for me? You have one saved message. Help me, Rain. Help me, Rain. Why are you here? Do you know Violet and Eva? Why did you left in such a hurry last time? Because I saw that painting: The 18th Doors. You received the phone messages too? The message: Welcome to Hell. How did you know? Because I also received this messages. Impossible. You've been in hell too? I drew that painting after playing the game. I didn't tell you because I didn't know you were playing that too. I'm already at the lower 9 levels of Hell. Lower 9 levels? The upper 9 levels, you need to complete one by one by conquering your fears. There are no rules from 10-18th level. Survival of the fittest. That's like life itself. Let's not talk about this. I came here today to ask you to be the model for my painting. Why me? That night, I received a message to enter the 2nd Level. Blood Pool of Hell. Excuse me, where's Dr. Yan's office? Upstairs. Dr. Yan? Yes. You are... I'm Inspector Yip. I'm in charge of Violet's case. I've a few questions to ask you. It won't take long. I'm sad about Violet. I checked with the school. They said she's been your assistant for a year. Inspector, why didn't you take the lift instead of the stairs? What's your point? No, just curious. I don't like lifts. Are you saying that I'm claustrophobic? No, you're just insecure in a space without support. But it won't affect your daily life. Don't worry. May I ask, anything unusual before Violet's death? How's her state of mind? Her friend's death probably made Violet feel guilty. You mean Eva? Do you know why she feels guilty? They've been busy with research. Tired minds tend to wander. It often happens to people. When something bad happens to a friend, you somehow feel responsible. Have you ever felt that way, inspector Yip? It's nature to people. Because of it, we often do stupid things we'd regret. Have you ever felt helplessness? Being helpless is all subjective. You mentioned they were researching, on what? I'm not sure. You need to ask their faculty supervisor. But I notice them sending message constantly. To who? I don't know. The number is really odd. I've seen it. Is it this number? Yes, let's call it. (Calling) Has Violet mentioned the Ghost Tower to you? Did she tell you the story about? Rain mentioned a little. She said it's haunted. A student name Wendy killed herself there 10 years ago. After that, there were many ghostly incidents. It's been deserted since. (You've passed the 3rd level.) (Proceed to the 4th level in 3 days.) (Read new message from 69741111?) (Welcome to the 7th Level of Hell.) Why did you take my phone? Are you trying to kill me? I'm not, Mandy. Where's my knife? Why do you need a knife? I hide it here. Mandy! Mandy! My knife is my weapon. Stop playing this game. Then why do you play? I just want to know what happened to Eva and Violet. I want to know what the 19th Level of Hell is. We always say 18 levels of Hell. Never heard of a 19th level. You'll have to go through it to find out. Aren't you afraid? I'm not. Mandy, you know something about Eva and Violet. No, I don't. Mandy! I feared of women when I was a child. I feared of my Mom, female teachers etc. I always find them fierce. But I've no reasons to fear of men. You recall seeing a butterfly knot. Anything else? And some moving white flowers. What else? Nothing. Anyone you remember the most? No. Are you telling me the truth, Rain? I was confused. I thought I saw my Dad. But when he turned around, it was my stepfather. Anything poignant or unforgettable happened? At 11, my Dad died by saving me from a car. Your stepfather? I forget. (Please select your weapon:) (1. Axe 2. Samurai Sword 3. machine gun) (Welcome to the 4th Level of Hell.) (Tips: Use your phone to find the exit.) (Kill him.) Conquer your fear to go on. (Passed the 4th Level.) (Passed the 4th Level.) (Please select: Fate or Chance) (Chance: Go direct to the 9th Level of Hell) Why are you at the cafeteria at late at night? Rain, you asked if I knew something. Don't tell me if you don't want to. Have you wondered who sent Eva that game? This diary belonged to Violet. Violet did everything. Why would she do that? Violet designed this program. Yet got herself killed. But if you knew... why do you still... Maybe I'm punishing myself. It's kind of pathetic to say it. You know what the best part of this game is? You choose your own move. No one can force you. I want to tell you this while I'm sane. Give me your phone. I will die if I lose it. Do you get it? I can't turn back. I know I can save myself... only by playing. You know what you are saying? Rain. Inspector Yip. It's true that Violet ran over someone. So it is true? Are you hiding something from me? Violet did everything. Violet designed that game. Eva was her first experiment. Then Eva sent that game to Mandy and me. Why don't you tell me earlier? She's dead. Why the game still going on? I don't know. But many things can't be explained. And I'm also one player who can't pull out. People who can't pass any level will go crazy or kill themselves. Like Mandy said... it's self-punishment. Violet killed Eva and herself. So they deserved to die? No, Eva didn't do anything bad. Never mind. Have you seen this symbol? No. It's for you. For me? Why? You found out Violet is the one behind everything. It must be upset you. So I send you this to cheer you up, open it. I only wish you can cast your pain to a faraway land. Rain, what we find scary is not fear itself. Fear exists. It can appear any where in any form. The scariest is human beings unwilling to face reality. They stop listening, seeing. And so, we'll lose something more precious. Yan, have you mixed the paint? What's this? It's my sculpture, Livelihood. This way. Rain. It's for you. Sit here. Why did you play this game? At first it was curiosity. Then it became fun. Chinese believe in 18 levels of hell. A specific level for each sin. The home wrecker will go to Hell of Metal Trees. The unfilial will go to Hell of Blood Pool. Different levels for different sinners. Human beings think that they are pure. They don't even know when they've erred. They'll choose a path destined for doom. Hell may have been something fabricated in history. But for a sinner, that fear will fester in his mind. Only those who survive in hell will make it to heaven. I continue to play so I can find out if I've done anything wrong. Rain, take it easy. As long as your conscience is clear, even in hell, you'll escape. Guess what I'm painting. I am sitting within the frame. Come over and see. This is an Indian religious symbol. Snake represents time. Middle is the ancient Jewish star. It represents devil. Now you see a Capricorn. It represents Satan. It's interesting to turn it upside down. It's a tortoise which represents vast land. This is a mid-century hell worshipper relic. But not famous. I know. It's a branch of European religious. They were extremists. Because of the Crusade, they believed in suffering extreme tests and torture before they can go to heaven. They call it purifying process. This branch suppressed by the Church and finally died out. In 19th century, a mysterious Italian painter, Marzolini propagated this extreme form of worship. Where it says Marzolini? Here it is. He's insane. His paintings are most about sins and deaths. Strange style. His first exhibition in 1898 was called Hell. There were 18 paintings altogether. But a huge fire burnt them all. People believed that his paintings were cursed, so they were unpopular. Marzolini decided to leave Italy and came to China. Influenced by the Chinese belief of 18 levels of hell, he showed the new concepts of hell. Rain, I'm hiding in a safe place. The monkey can't find me. Mandy, you said you get to choose. You can choose to quit. I will be ok... We've to face our mistakes. Mandy, where are you? The judgment day will come. (You're about to enter the phone chat room.) No! (Marzolini wants to speak to you.) (Please select: Agree or Disagree.) (Agree.) Hi, do you know where you are? Guess I'll be at the No. Are you scared? What about you? Are you scared? You can't talk to me like this. I'm the Guardian of Hell. Guardian of Hell? So you'd know what the Of course. Tell me then. You need to pass through the 18 levels to enter the 19th, then you'll find out. What if I don't pass these 18 levels? Then you'll see "game over". Eva killed herself because she didn't make it through? (Welcome to the 9th Level of Hell.) (Please select) (2. See the special someone.) Don't leave... Keep me company. It's Cold here. You can't get away. Don't run. (No battery) I believe you. You're innocent. You'll survive. I have to burn myself to death... I have to burn myself to death... Mandy... Don't do it, Mandy. Mandy... calm down... Relax. Let me burn myself... Mandy, what's wrong? (Reward: Direct access to) (the 18th Level of Hell.) Dr. Man, how's Mandy? Suffering from hallucination. Her symptoms are very odd. So I thought of a new treatment. What treatment? I just gave her a new phone. Although she's mumbling away, ignoring me, she reacted once she saw the phone. I sent her a message. Her thumbs started fidgeting. She replied my message. Can I try? Sure. Excuse me. Mandy, try to recall. When did you start playing this game? Eva! Is it fun? It's fun! I can see Gao all day until that monkey appeared. Don't feel guilty. You didn't kill that monkey. That monkey... But I caused my teacher to die. I hated that teacher most. That accident had another survivor. Let me go... I don't want to die. Save me. I didn't save her. I didn't save her. I didn't mean to. It's not my fault... Inspector Yip, can't you tell? About what? There's a logic to the game. You believe it is the last judgment on earth? If you've sinned, you'll get your retribution. Mandy mentioned Gao several times. Is it Gao from the night gallery? Yes. I think he's involved with an ancient cult. What? He could be the one behind everything. That's impossible. It was Violet. Calm down. Even if Gao is not involved, I'm sure Violet was not the only one Good, let's go to Gao and find out. Can I go alone? Rain, keep your phone on. You're alone? Where's Dr. Yan? He came with you every time. What's wrong? It's nice you've back. Yip wants the address of Wendy. The philosophy student who hung herself 10 years ago? We don't have her records in the database. Try the back office archive. Wendy reminds me of Gao... I remember there was a student who hang out with them often. Gao? Gao who has exhibitions at the night gallery now? Exhibition now? No way, he killed himself 10 years ago. He's dead? Are you sure? Yes, he killed himself in his hostel. Rumor has it... He died for love, for Wendy. Try and recall. Can you remember the name of that third student they hang out together. He was very ordinary. He walked with a limp. (Rain's 18th Level of Hell.) (Send. Completed.) (Mesmerist voice controls thinking) (Eva's 1st Level of Hell) Gao, let's take one more photo. (Violet's 1st Level of Hell) It wasn't my fault. It was pitch dark. The old lady dashed out. Gao, you've to believe me. (Mandy's 2nd Level of Hell) Gao, I'm still scared. Many monkeys are laughing at me. (Rain's 4th Level of Hell) Why do you play this game? (From 69741111) Welcome to the 18th Level of Hell.) Gao is an illusion? November 19th,1996 Wendy had entered Marzolini's However, she was confused and irrational. November 22th, when Gao and I found her in the building, she was dead. Why? What went wrong? The theory about hell can't be wrong. I must do the experiment again. I must do the experiment again. I must find out after the 18th level what the 19th level is like. January 2nd, 1997, I don't get it. Gao, I promised you that I'd stop using people in the experiment Why do you kill yourself to punish me? (You've entered the 18th Level of Hell,) (Hell of Snow Mountain.) (You'll see the person you hate most.) (You will have a chance to revenge.) Gao's hell theory... I can't just give it up I'm sure someone can pass the 18th level and reach the 19th level. Yan! Stop running! Where can you go? I never thought that you was the one who created the game Without the talented Violet, this game can't go on. You sent her the Hell game. You'd hurt a young girl? I didn't mean to hurt anyone. You sound quite innocent. You are brilliant. You caused all the girls to hallucinate. Is it hard to do that? Do you know how to? Is it the sound of ring tones? Are we dreaming every day? Cut the bullshit. No choice. You'll be punished for what you've done. All facts are recorded in our minds. When we are frightened, we'll create all these illusions and try to escape the reality. I told you. Hell is only in our minds. Get it? Why did you create this game? Trying to prove that you are God? Yan! You are wrong! I just want to fulfill Gao's dream. Gao is Marzolini's descendant. To prove Marzolini's Hell theory, he'd prove everyone is a sinner and has to go through hell. But when we go through the 18th level, we'll be eliminated by our guilty conscience. Even if you try to prove that theory, you can't determine who live or die. Gao felt that humans are too weak. So he wanted to prove only the good and strong can survive in hell. Otherwise, we'd never know what the 19th Level of Hell is. After listening to you, I think you're a psychopath. If I admit that I'm a psychopath, will the world become a better place and make you feel better? Are you a righteous man as you appear to be? Do you still remember Wendy? She is your first experiment. Remember her? I don't want to talk to you. You're twisting facts. She volunteered for it. All three of us could have gone to the 19th level. We could have gone to the 19th level. You hypnotized her. She saw all the scary images of hell, so she went crazy. Finally killed herself. She could have survived in hell, but something went wrong. Yip. Don't you want the good one to come back, the precious moments stay alive? Don't you want to see someone you miss? You hurt her! You left her! She's in front of you. You see her back, her ear. She's smiling at you. Where can you run? (Game starts) It's impossible... It's not real. There is no ghost in the world. Yip, it's for you. What book is the straight A student reading? It's a English book. Give me. Let me see it. No. Come on... (Cherie wants to talk to you.) You revenged for me. But you really want them to die? Yes, I hated them. So you killed them. Did I? Yes, then shot yourself. Only the last survivor goes to the next level. Then I shot myself. You can't hurt me anymore. You're dead. I'm not afraid of you anymore. There's a logic to this game. I can't believe Violet and Dr. Yan are in it together. Even if you think Yan is brilliant, it's crime somehow. This game is like a computer virus. Contaminate phones and hypnotize the users. So you see those delusions. But when we play without our phones, we'll be "game over" easily. I nearly made it to the 19th level. Look at you, like you are having fun by playing it. I told you to stop playing. Take a look. Doesn't she look like you? I remember that Yan saying: Wish the good one to come back. It must be her. Gao. Let it go, it's only a nightmare. It may be a nice dream. I don't get how you girls are thinking. Love is the greatest hypnosis. Remember that Gao is dead. Forget him. He saved me. When did he? In Hell. You still believe that is true? Rain, remember. Girls must be strong. There isn't someone to protect you always. Then why are you being so nice to me? Dr. Yan. I've been waiting for you. I never knew... you've lived in our old room. It's you all along? Feeling disappointed? (Rain) Whenever I see you, I see her. You mean Wendy? Yes, so I changed the rules on your game. Hoping you'll be strong and confident. Survive in all levels. At the memorial, you... Yes, I reminded you how to play in the lower levels. Of all the girls, you're the only one who could conquer your fear. The number you dial... is not connected at this moment... Rain. Both of us want to see the 19th level, right? You want to see Gao? Can I? You can. But you may have no return. Yan, don't move. She choose to be hypnotized. You've to enter her dream to wake her up. Save me! Inspector Yip, help! Let us stay together forever. Rain! Let go of Gao. He's just an illusion. If you can't tell illusion from reality, you can never return. Let me go. Rain, wake up. He's only Yan. He killed Eva and Mandy. Wake up. You can't fall. Didn't you promise to be with me forever? I entered the game to found out the pain what Wendy went through. Thank you. I know how she felt now. Gao... Rain, use all your strength. Don't fall. I'll save you. You don't deserve to Hell. You really believe that I'm innocent? Rain! Where's exit? Let me out! Inspector Yip... Wake up! Inspector Yip. Help! Inspector Yip. Don't you hunger for the old good times to replay?
