Is that how you talk to a customer? Come on! You? A customer? What did you just say? Are you laughing? What's worse, cola from there or tap water from here? What does cola have to do with this?

Brats, you need to make sure you get yourselves some land. Do you know how important it is to get land in Korea? It's me. Could you bring me I brought 300 meters with me but it's not enough. I'm at that slum called 1st Street. It's a long story. I don't know! He said he was a reporter from KBS 9 o'Clock News. No, KBS! Not MBC! KBS! Dammit. He was really talking down to me, like he was important. The joker said he's doing research! Please get me that cable! - Is he on the internet? - Yeah. That guy's amazing. They said there was no internet here. And our water supply got fixed right after he came here. Wow...! I'll put you on a 3-year contract. - 2 weeks! - I'm sorry? Two weeks, man! If that's all you want, you should go to an internet cafe. Do you see any internet cafes around here? Could you please make an initial payment of 50,000 won? Why? Well, Mr. Cho, you have a bad credit rating. So we need to take an initial payment before opening your connection. So poor people shouldn't use the internet? I don't make the rules, you know. Who does, then? Maybe you should call your boss out here! Are these hard times for reporters? My job is to pursue the truth. I'll take this one. That one only comes free with a three-year contract. That's outrageous! It's a basic rule. What? Basic rule? More like misleading advertising. Want to be on the news for false advertising? Am I wrong? Ildong, will the tomatoes really grow? Are you a moron? If you plant tomatoes, you'll get tomatoes. It's common sense. What does common sense mean? Don't you even know? Do you know? No. Dammit... Hey! Got some kimchi at your place? Kimchi. Just a little bit! Did you make this? This kimchi tastes of nothing, Did you even put spices in it? Have you got any noodles left? Yeah. How old are you? You'll end up in hell for what you're doing. We're offering you a lot of money to leave. Wouldn't we both be happy if we just did the deal? There's never been a way out of poverty. You know why? Poor people just don't listen to anyone. Worst thing is, poor people always stick to themselves. There's no chance of progress. Hey! Ildong! None of them have grown. Still a long time yet. Shouldn't we water them? Really? Just a bit, then. How much? - One cup. - What size cup? A gourd of water. Isn't that too much? Too much water might kill them. It won't, you little brats. You guys are full of suspicion. Get me a cup of barley water! We got none. We got some mineral water. Anything cold, you brat! She into sports? You mean Myeongnan? That's her name? What's her sport? - Pugilism! - Boxing? Pugilism! Myeongnan's father was Asian champion. - Dumbass! I need 100 boxes here. - Yes boss. Hey! Who's coming to Chuncheon with me? - Me...! Me! Me! - Me! Bunch of losers. Dumbass. Want to go to Chuncheon? Is that okay? Get these crates loaded then. Dumbass, how much you earn per day? Guys get 30,000 and you 25,000? Mean bastards. Take this and call it a day. Just take it! Seonju, want to have dinner with me? What kind of woman do you like? Me? A good, honest person. Good and honest. I like that. Good and... Drink some cola! I don't drink soda. Do they have juice here? Juice? At a barbecue restaurant? So drinking sewage is okay, but not juice in a barbecue restaurant? That's enough about sewage! Seems like you're about to hit me. Stop talking about sewage! You like me, don't you? What? It's just too bad. Mom said don't go near anyone that's not a doctor or lawyer. That stuff no longer applies! You need a professional who's an expert. No! Now is the era of network marketing! No, no. Wrong. What's wrong? Don't do things like that. Things like what? You're not really the type for a pyramid scheme. I told you, it's not like that. It's all the same. You should know. How many times do I have to say it? It's network marketing! You worked hard. Have a drink. - I'm okay, thanks. - Come on! It'll stop you feeling tired. Cheers! Myeongnan... Myeongnan! Since we're out here, let's try a local hot spring. - A hot spring? - Yeah. I'm all right.

You know I've looked after Your father since before he was born? He must have been in middle school. He came to me with two black eyes, and asked me to teach him boxing. But you don't learn boxing just to fight with people! He ran around after me for two months. I told him I'd teach him a lesson, told him to put the gloves on. Said I'd teach him to box If he lasted three rounds against me. I wanted to put the kid in his place. I let loose with my fists. He kept going for 1 8 rounds! The die-hard bastard! I asked him why he was so hell-bent on learning to box. He told me he'd taken a beating in front of a girl Who he had a crush on, from a guy that did boxing. He was so naive!

She's a woman, you bitch. You bitch! Try and hit me again! Filthy whore! Hit me again! Mr. Kim! Calm down. She's just a kid, she knows nothing. I can take care of this, so... Why? You on her side? You two together? Want to be buried together? Goddam traitor! Son of a bitch! Die! Die, die, die! Get a print! Yes, Boss. You need to step into line, bitch. Get the whole village wrapped up! Yes, Boss! - Bastard! - I said give it to me, dirty slut! No way! You treat your parents like this? Son of a bitch! Look! We gave it too much water, it's died! What'll happen to Grandpa? Stay still, you dirty slut! Stop! No! No! What are you doing, bitch? It's my house! It's my house! Just gimme the print, bitch! Take it! Bitch! Don't cry, girl! We'll just plant another one! What good is that? It's rude to throw things at grown-ups! Why are you taking our house? Bastards! Take this. Rent a room or something with this money. I've got you a little more. It'll be enough for the moment. Does that make you feel better? You and I live our lives by different rules. You need to get him to a hospital immediately. What happens if he stays like this? It will be hard for him to keep going beyond six months. I hate to ask this, but six months in hospital... how much? Well... it costs around 5 million won. The year you were born. Born on the same day, but this one seems to have had a rougher ride. Doesn't matter anyway. The value stays the same. And there's already a new one! Seonju... this is pretty hard to say. But if I don't say it now, I'll regret it. So... The reason I wanted to meet you... is that I want to be a more special person to you, in 2007. A guy like me is nothing special. You know I just run a few vending machines and sell coffee. I know I'm inadequate for a girl like you, but I'm sure I can give you a good life. You know I can't tell a lie, don't you? If you reject me, - I'll put so much sewage... - Actually... I've got a boyfriend. What? I should have told you before. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry... I'm sorry. I had no idea... I am very sorry. I apologize. How embarrassing. Seonju! Press the "out of order" button on the vending machine! I fixed it so you get a free drink. Don't tell anyone else! "Have faith in the Lord Jesus, and you and your family will be saved. " Lend me your lighter. I can't find one. Thanks. Boss! Something's kicked off outside! Geumcheon! Geumcheon! You drive nails into others' hearts, you'll end up paying for it. What are you doing? All I want is a place To stay out of the wind and the rain. Don't do this! - Calm down! - Why are you ruining my life? Hopefully I'll be reborn as a wild beast. Don't do this! Just talk to me for a while! Don't do this! Put the lighter away! Don't do it! Talk to me! Dammit! Myeonho, I'm here. Hey Myeongho. You listen carefully to what lm about to say. You know what the doctor has said. Meyongran did all she could. No daughter nowadays could have done better. As a father, It wouldn't be right to be a burden on her anymore. We all die once. Just take a shot of this. Take a shot and just go to sleep. Then all the trouble will be over. You understand what I'm saying, right? Help me! So long. Help me! When's your fight? Day after tomorrow. Confident? I'm home. Have you eaten? Yeah. Did you buy this stuff? Some young man just brought it. Asked me to give you a letter- it's on the fridge. Who is he? I liked the look of him. Seonju! Everyone has things they don't want to talk about. You don't have to talk about it if it's too hard. I'm far from perfect myself.. It gives me hope I can become a better person. Oh yeah! I made up my mind and bought some movie tickets. This is a bit embarrassing, but with trying to make ends meet I've never been to a movie theater in my whole life. Let's start taking in some culture! P.S. I got tickets for a couple's seating. Are you doing well in school? Yes. I see. Where did you come in class? He came in at the bottom of his class again! Oh...! Am I wrong? Do you want to make your grandpa sad By coming in last? Study hard from now on. - Yes. - Good. Stop! There are people in there! What? People? How come? Myeongnan - I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, Dad. Don't say that! Just wait a little longer. I'm confident. Get out! The diggers can work from here upwards... Come on, move it! Run! What the hell are you doing? Move your asses! The challenger, Son Myeongnan, is practically an unknown commodity. In fact, her father is the former Asian champion, Son Myeongho. From the late 1980s, if I remember correctly. Myeongnan! Guard up! Take it to her. That's right. Strike short! Strike short! Strike! Just don't throw hooks. Throw some body punches. Like her father, this boxer seems Extremely strong at close range. The current champion, Seo ln-yeong, is in real trouble. Yes, she's taken a shower of hits Right from the start. She's driven her into the corner. - A double hit to the stomach! - You're right. Son Myeongnan lets through a cut, and Seo is off on the counter-attack. The champion Seo hit back! Right face! Both fighters getting in some hard punches. Such passion right from the start! Amazing. - Go. - Yes, Boss. Open your eyes! Punch, girl! Wow, she's been knocked down. - Around the corner! - Seo, fighting! You got her well that time! Get your breathing under control! Get her with your right. Right here! Keep on with the right, got it? Fight! Let me go, you bastard! Get yourself together! It's okay! Don't get up yet! Get up on eight! Wait till eight! It's ok! It's ok! Can you carry on? Come out here. Time! Please take a look at this wound. Wow- plenty of blood flowing! Significant blood loss... I can go on! I can! It's all right. Come on. Fight! Turn around! Didn't you hear me? Turn the other way! Turn around! Turn around! Turn around! Why are those men smashing up our house? I said turn around! Can't you hear me? Turn around. Turn around! Turn around! Turn around! Around! I'm sorry. Please don't hit my brother. You little shit! Got no respect for anyone! That's why everyone calls you a filthy beggar! Stupid morons... Ildong. Listen to me. They're knocking down your house to build you a new one. They can't built you a new house without knocking down the old one. Makes sense, doesn't it? It's a good thing, so don't cry. Pray! Pray that they'll build you a good house. Turn around! You guys know the song about the toad? Start singing it, okay? Go! ~Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad! - ~I'll give you an old house... - Louder! ~so give me a new house! Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad! - ~I'll give you an old house. - Louder! ~so give me a new house! ~Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad! I'll give you an old house, so give me a new house! ~Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad! I'll give you an old house, so give me a new house! ~Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad! I'll give you an old house, so give me a new house! ~Mr. Toad, Mr. Toad! Die, you son of a bitch! I'm gonna kill you, son of bitch! Two, three... Four, five, six... It's the final round in Seo's 8th fight to defend her championship. All the way to Round 10! - We're at the ultimate stage. - Yes. Myeongnan! Myeongnan! Get a grip, my girl! Can you see this? Yes or no? Can't you do this? Shall we give up? I'm okay. I'm still standing. It's hard to watch. Myeongnan, are you okay? - Don't throw in the towel. - What? Do not throw in the towel! Understand? You mustn't throw it in. Get the chair! Breathe! Breathe! Myeongnan! You've won. You're champion, girl! This is the official result announcement. By 3-0, the judges unanimously award victory to the red corner! Dad! Tired? I'm really sorry. I want to take good care of you, But I can't. Why? You should have been with me, even if it was hard. You're the first man I ever loved. Why didn't you give me a chance? Myeongnan. What did I say I am? Champion. And what does that mean? The strongest person in the world! That's right. You're a champion now. So you mustn't show your weaknesses! I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. Our house has gone. It's all right. - You just prayed lots, didn't you? - Yes. It's all right. It's all right. Don't eat stuff that's for Grandpa! You'll drive me insane. You what? Don't hit me on the head! What? You want me to be as dumb as you? You out of your mind? Ildong! Isun! Come and eat! Yes, Mom. Come on, girl. What? you're going to hit me after dinner? Do not fight in front of Mom, okay? Did you hear me? Behave yourself first. Are you insane? Did you sell your car? Who drives a car in today's traffic? Why are you good to me? You have a problem with it? - Uncle! - Yeah. Thanks. Shut up, girl! Concentrate on your boxing. And make sure you win today's fight, okay? It's a big one. And don't call me 'Uncle!' So what do I call you? Just use my first name, it sounds better. Hello? This is Cho Pilje, manager of Asian champion Son Myeongnan. Sorry... where? Spr...?
