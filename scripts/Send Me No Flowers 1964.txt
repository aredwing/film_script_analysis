Nasal passages clogging up on you? Don't give it another thought! Try,|new doctor-prescribed Nauseadrine, with the new,|magic ingredient N.U. 202, and smash your troubles away. Tummy feel crummy? You bet it does! And there you go,|taking those rotten tablets. Nothing happens,|they just lay there. Now watch wonder-working|Garbagine go to work. See how much faster the new-formula,|better-than-ever Garbagine tablets are|than that no-good brand. George, breakfast! Good morning, Arnold. Mrs. Kimball? Hi, Ernie. - Isn't it|a lovely morning? - Oh, it is cute. Yoghurt, carrot juice, cottage cheese, organic honey,|non-fat, and eggs, fertile. The Fishers on Maple St. Got|a new car today. Only it's 2nd hand. Don't breathe a word of this,|but you know the Bullards? Now, remember,|don't spread this around. George! Hey Nash, it's Vito, the cleaner. Hey Daddy-O, I got your cleaning. Ruth! Need a hand, Mrs. Kimball? Judy?|- I heard you, you said "ooh." Doesn't it concern you,|I have this pain in my chest? I'm always concerned. It's just that I've had such|a morning. You would not believe it. I called Dr. Morrissey.|I'm going to have a complete check-up. It's probably nothing serious.|- But you just had one 2 weeks ago! In 2 weeks a body can turn on you.|Just like that. While it's turning, eat breakfast.|- Not until Ralph looks me over. At least have a piece of toast.|It won't show up in the X-ray. It's roughage.|- I don't know why I bother to cook. Well, maybe one piece of toast. Have I got something to tell you!|Guess what. The Bullards are getting a divorce. The Bullards?|- The milkman told me. - Who are they? They live on the next block.|I don't know them, but I expected it. You did? Although you don't know them? I know all about them.|Marjorie told me at bridge. That poor thing! There must be|really something wrong with him. How do you know? Maybe|there's something wrong with her. Oh, no. She's very nice.|I met her at the supermarket. She may be nice at the supermarket,|but not nice at home. You know... - No butter!|It's loaded with cholesterol. 2 years ago you'd never heard|of cholesterol. Now it's a big thing! Laugh if you want, but men my age|are dropping like flies! Do you read the obituary page?|It's enough to scare you to death. Then why do you read it?|- Should I bury my head in the sand? No. But why do you think you have|every disease you hear about? What do you mean by that? Come on! Remember|when they operated on Whitey Ford? You thought|you had bone chips in your elbow. There definitely was pain there. Your hypochondria's showing. I am not a hypochondriac.|Listen, someday when I'm lying in hospital,|then you'll change your tune. You better hurry,|you'll miss your train. Bye! What's today?|- Friday. Maybe I better cancel lunch|with Winston Burr, the way I feel... Darling,|I think you could risk a cup of tea. I don't suppose a cup of weak tea|would hurt me, whatever's wrong. Your call to Mrs. Bullard, Mr. Burr.|- Thank you. - Bullard? Is she the one getting a divorce?|- Yeah. How did you know? We have the same milkman.|- Watch this, the Winston Burr patented procedure|for potential divorcees: Hello, Linda. Winston. Winny Burr. Linda, I heard the horrible news.|Well, I'm just heartbroken. Yeah. I always considered|you and David my best friends. If there's anything I can do,|you mustn't hesitate to call me. Yeah. The next couple of weeks|are going to be very tough. You'll be... lonely. Yeah. Say, why don't we have|a quiet little drink together tonight? Maybe I could think of something|to bring you and David back together. Okay, I'll pick you up at 8 o'clock.|Tonight. How's that? Alright, little darling.|And... cheer up. You are a 100%,|non-shrinkable, no-money-back ratfink! Yeah, but a bachelor ratfink. I'll see you at the club tomorrow.|Good luck with your doctor. Check, please! Ooh boy, am I pooped! I made 8 house calls this morning. Why in blazes didn't I specialize,|so I could get some sleep? Like those lucky allergists. They keep hours just like a banker,|and make the same kind of money, too. I know one of them, built a|$100,000 house on ragweed alone. When the pollen count goes up,|just like the stock market... Ralph, I have this pain...|- Thank goodness it's Friday. I'm going fishing this weekend.|A friend of mine has a cabin cruiser. Gastroenterologist. He'd look|at anything but gall bladders. He is absolutely cleaning up. You'll be on a boat the whole weekend?|- That's right. Can't you be reached in an emergency?|- Emergency? What emergency? No, 90% of my patients have|absolutely nothing wrong with them. And the 10% that have|something seriously wrong, I send them to a specialist. Now, what is the trouble?|- What? Oh, well, I have this pain...|- Can you show me where it is? - Right here. It hurts|like the Devil when I press it. Then don't press it.|Now George, tell me, is it a sharp pain,|is it a dull pain, or does it grip, like a vice?|- Yes. No. Pick one. I'd say it was more of a sharp pain. I guess we'd better take a listen. Do you have any idea what it might be?|- Not yet. It's probably nothing serious.|You know how Judy worries. Take a deep breath. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. You can button up now, George.|- What's the bad news? What? - This pain in my chest,|is there a medical term for it? Yes. It's called indigestion. I want you to take these pills. One before each meal|and again before retiring. What kind of pills are they?|- You wouldn't know if I told you. Oh, Ralph...|That cardiogram you took... Yeah, what about it?|- That's what I was going to ask. What are you talking about?|- How did it turn out? I don't know. The results aren't due|from Dr. Peterson for another week. He's had it for 2 weeks. Isn't he studying it for a long time?|- Dr. Peterson is a very busy man. Biggest cardiologist in the city.|Got a regular goldmine there. Well, in your opinion,|everything is Okay? George, you are sound as a bell. I wish all my patients|were as healthy as you are. Speaking non-professionally, that is.|- And this pain in my chest? I can just live a normal life?|- I would. You can take|one of those pills now if you want. Right now? Is it so urgent?|- It doesn't make any difference. No, I'll take it now|if it's that important. Is that my chart, Ralph? Aren't you writing an awful lot|for just indigestion? The more I write,|the more money I charge. Oh, good. Hello? Oh yes, he is, Doctor. I appreciate how busy you've been.|That's why I didn't press you on it. Whose cardiogram? William Mallone's? Yes, I've been worried about him.|He's getting on in years. What does|the cardiogram show, Dr. Peterson? What? Oh, that's really a shame. But, still, what can you do?|Give him a few pills to ease the pain in his chest. Not much you can do|when the old ticker goes, eh? How much time do you figure he's got,|Doctor? Few weeks. Yes, I've seen them go just like that. No, I'm not going to tell him.|I think he's better off not knowing. Alright. Fine, you have a nice weekend too,|Doctor. Bye-bye. I'm back, Ralph.|- Good. Do you still want me to take these|pills? - Yes, to ease your chest pain. Ralph? Do you mind|if I ask you some questions? Not at all, go ahead.|- Well, suppose you had a patient and found out|he only had a few weeks to live. I mean, he could go just like that. Would you tell him?|- Well, offhand I would say, but it'd all depend on the circumstances.|- Circumstances? - Yes. If I knew the man's affairs|were in order, his will made out, his insurance paid up, no loose ends,|well, I'd see no reason to tell him. Well, suppose he were an old friend,|like me. Are your affairs in order,|will made out, insurance paid up? The I wouldn't tell you. Anything else|I can do for you, George? Goodbye, Mr. Kimball. See you in church! Judy?|Yeah? Come on, we're teeing off at 2:30.|- Just a second. - What are you doing? Making George's sleeping pills.|- What are you, a pharmacist? I'm a very smart wife.|You know George. He's convinced he can't sleep|without a pill, but I know it's sugar. And it works? - It has for 5 years.|You know something else? When he takes two|he goes to sleep twice as fast. That's a story for a medical journal!|- That'd ruin everything. - Why? He reads it every week.|- Oh, no! Hi, George.|- Hello, Arnold. Ruth is flying to her mother's,|the kids are in camp, and I'm alone. And unafraid. What are you doing?|- Eating. Nuts? George Kimball? Cholesterol? What's the matter?|You seem kind of down. Arnold, can I take you into my|confidence? - You can, George. Well,|I've just heard some rather bad news. You've got to promise to keep quiet.|I wouldn't want it to get around. It's nothing that's going to|affect property values, is it? No, I wouldn't think so. That's a relief. What, then? You know this little pain in my chest|I've been complaining about? You mean your indigestion?|- Well, it's not indigestion. No? It's curtains, Arnold. Curtains? What do you mean, "curtains"?|- I just came from the doctor's. He only gives me a few weeks to live.|- Oh, come on! I don't believe it.|- It's true. It's the ticker. Holy cow! Are they sure? I had Peterson,|the biggest cardiologist in the city. Holy cow! Gee, George,|I don't know what to say. This is so sudden, you... George, I...|I believe I better have a drink. I'd like to have one with you,|if you don't mind. Certainly not. I'd like a martini.|- Same. Double. George?|- What? How are you going to tell Judy?|- Judy? Oh, I'm not going to tell her. - No?|- No. I couldn't bear it. She'd probably go to pieces,|all that weeping and wailing. You know Judy. - Yeah, I remember|how she was when the dog died. I don't mean there'd be a comparison.|This would be much worse. You know what I mean. Of course, Arnold.|- George, is there anything I can do? Not as a lawyer, but as|your best friend. - I don't know. Somebody has to|take care of the funeral details. Do you want to do that?|- I'll do it. I'll do it. What's the matter with him?|- It's so nice to see you. It's good to see you, George. How is everything?|- Everything's just fine. That's wonderful, wonderful. Hi, Arnold. - Hi.|- Ruth get off alright? Like a rocket.|- Good. How are you, Judy? What are you taking,|George's vitamin pills? Dear, I want you to know you can|always count on me. - Thanks, Arnold. I think we should drive Arnold home.|He can pick up his car tomorrow. Judy, do you know|what type of man you're married to? Thinking of the other guy, even at|a time like this. - A time like this? He means, at a time when|he forgets where he parked his car. You can ride with us, Arnie. Come on. That was brilliant. Come on, Arnold. Judy, I just wanted to tell you,|I live right next door, alright? Right, Arnold. - If you need me|for anything, day or night, that's where I'll be, right next door. Thanks a lot, Arnold. Oh, was he bombed.|What's he had to drink? Hello, Mrs. Kimball. For you|we put it through special. That is something! Almost as wild|as this morning's outfit, huh? Bye, now. Pretty fresh kid.|- Oh, he's just friendly. Friendly? Bet he makes out|pretty good in this neighborhood. Oh, darling? Joe at the gas station|gave me back this check. He said it's the wrong amount|and I should make out a new one. The bill was 45.58 and,|I don't know why, but I wrote 78.60. The figure's not $78.60, it's 7-8-6-0.|You paid your license plate! You're kidding. That's an odd one. Now, anybody can make a mistake...|- I'd like to talk to you. Judy? How would you like|to go to night school? Where? - Night school.|Just a couple of nights a week. To learn banking,|bookkeeping, a little accounting. That's just... Why? - Because|these things keep our ship afloat. For example: What does|"amortization of a mortgage" mean? I don't care.|- But you've got to care. That's your department.|- But it's important for you to know. Why should we both know the|same things? - Judy, please. Will you let me get dinner going?|- That's what I want to talk about. How much is a pound of ham?|- I don't know, I didn't buy a pound. How much did you buy? - A half pound.|- How much was it? If I don't know that either. How do you know they're not cheating|you, if you don't know the prices? Would you tell me why you're|getting so worked up about ham? It's not just ham,|it's the whole principle. George, you didn't lose your job?|- No, I didn't lose my job. I'll have it the rest of my life.|- Then what are you worried about? You better check on Arnold.|See if he wants to have dinner, huh? We can eat in half an hour. What does "amortization" mean? Hindus had the right idea. When|the husband died, the wife went too. Threw herself on the funeral pyre.|And he didn't have to worry about her. I've been thinking, and|I want to do this, so don't say no. Fact is, I consider it a privilege.|- What? - I want to deliver a eulogy. That'd be fine. - And don't worry,|I'll give you one gorgeous send-off. I'm sure you will. Just wish|I could be around to hear it. Maybe I can knock out|a rough draft before you go. You know something, Arnold?|Judy will never make alone. Look at it this way, George: Judy's young, she's attractive,|she'll probably get married again. I'm sorry, I shouldn't say a thing like that,|with you not gone yet. It's alright, Arnold. Of course it's a possibility.|Judy might get married again. Suppose she married the wrong man,|like poor Janet Hart. Remember her? Who? - Janet and Bill Hart.|Don't you remember? - No. After Bill died Janet needed somebody|to lean on, so she took the first guy. One week after the funeral|she ran off with a bongo player. A bongo player?|- Yeah. Took her for every cent.|- Is that going to happen to Judy? Who knows? She could turn to the first|man that comes along. - Holy cow! Arnold? There's no question: Judy should marry again, but to|the right man. I've got to find him. Another husband? Who, George? I don't know. I'll find somebody. I'm a married man, George. Not you. Woods must be|full of eligible bachelors. Did it come yet, baby?|- What, mio amore? The 50 thou,|the old boy's life insurance. Is that enough, Vito?|- For now. If we need more we can sell the joint. Mr. Kimball is here, Mr. Atkins. You phoned us about|the purchase of a final resting place. Sit down, won't you?|- Thank you. This has been a busy morning.|Did you see the Archers? - Who? The Archers on Meadow Rd.|Do you know them? - I don't think so. They're a family of 8. They|were all in. Wonderful to see them. You don't get|those big families anymore. I can understand your point of view.|- Do you know Green Hills? - Pardon? Do you have anyone residing with us?|- Not as yet. You saw our advertising campaign.|- No, I must have missed it. I think I have a copy somewhere.|Oh, there it is. There she be. Sure hits you in the eye, doesn't it? Yes, it sure does.|- We suggest the entire family all go out|and select the final resting place. The kids love it. They have a ball!|- I'll bet they do. If you'll notice, all monuments|in Green Hills are the same height, 4 feet. As you see, it gives|a wonderful impression of uniformity. A sort of Levittown of the hereafter. I like that. "The Levittown of..." - Mr. Atkins,|could we get down to business? Yes Siree-Bob.|As soon as I find the old order pad. Here we are! Now, how many in your family,|Mr. Kimball? Just my wife and myself. Oh, well. That's alright. Chance of any little additions, maybe? Well, there might be|another man along later. I beg your pardon. Mr. Atkins, let me ask you a question. Assuming the husband goes first,|and then later on the wife remarries. Then the wife goes next, and she's|buried alongside her first husband. When the second husband goes,|is he buried alongside the other two? I mean, are they all put in together? Yes, that happens. Well, make it for three. Alrighty, reservations for three. Now, how much is this?|- $1,000. - $1,000? We throw in the 1st year's gardening.|How's that get you? Swell. I'd like write the check to cash.|- Suit yourself. You see, I'd rather|my wife didn't know about this. You want to surprise her.|- Yes. This'll give her a real thrill! It makes a very thoughtful gift.|Let me show you. We've got a lovely layout. I think we'll put you in K-1, 2 and 3. Sunset Hill,|right next to Folded Wings. Oh, you're lucky. That's nice high ground.|Lovely view from here. Sounds marvellous.|- It's a honey. When is it available? - It's kept|in tip-top shape at all times. Whenever you're ready, we're ready.|- That's comforting. Thank you, Mr. Atkins. - There's one|more thing I think you should know. What's that? - It's not of immediate|concern, but there are plans for a state highway|that would go through Green Hills. A state highway? - Not until 1980,|and that's not definite. But in the event it does|come to pass, we'll see to everything at our expense. - What does that mean?|- We'll either move you or, if you wish,|put you deeper under the freeway. I see. Either way,|whatever the others do, I'll go along. Fine and dandy. I'll get the deed to you|in a day or so. Enjoy your work, don't you?|- I wouldn't want to do anything else. I like people.|- Well, goodbye. - Oh, Mr. Kimball! Your green stamps. I'll change. Meet you in 15 minutes.|- I don't think I'll play today. Oh, George!|- No, I don't think I'd better. Oh honey, I hate to play alone.|- I'll meet you on the ninth green. Okay. Arnold, I did it.|- Yeah? I bought a cemetery plot.|- Good. Use it in good health. I'm sorry.|I'm not in very good shape today. I've just one more thing to attend to,|then I'll stop this gallivanting, and go to bed and wait.|- What's that? A husband for Judy. Look: I made a list of all|the eligible bachelors around here. Good morning Arnold, George.|- Hi. - Hi, Sam. How about old Sam Scheffing?|- He hasn't got a quarter. Never could stand him, anyway.|- Judy needs a wealthy man. How about Paul Pendergrass?|He's playing tennis here today. He's reasonably good-looking. Not as reasonable as you, but... I'm sorry. There's Harry Hanson. Plays a great handicap. Two.|Is he on your list? - No. Put him on the list. Fine competitor. Fore! You're a fraud, Harry Hanson!|- Shh, quiet. Sit down and be quiet. You should be exposed!|- Come on, let's find Judy. It's a little discouraging, isn't it?|- A bit. I said it yesterday:|The woods are full of them. What woods, George?|- What's the difference? Any woods. What's that?|- Time for my pill. It hardly seems|worthwhile to take a pill. I'm sorry, George. Help! Look out, George! Look out, George! Judy, wait! Arnold, hurry. No, go that way. Faster, Arnold! Look out! I can't stop! I'm sorry. Somebody, stop this thing! Step on it!|- I am! Thank you.|- It's alright, you're safe now. What's the matter with you? Now, just a minute...|- Judy! Bert! Bert Power!|- Judy Heppleway! Gosh, you look pretty as ever!|- I'm sure I look terrible! Judy Heppleway.|- George, George Kimball! Maybe we should go, we're intruding.|- Bert, meet my husband George and our|good friend and neighbor Arnold Nash. Fellas, this is Bert Power, my|college... - Sweetheart. Hi, Arnold. George. - Oh, excuse me,|I thought you were the good friend. I'm not her good friend,|I'm her husband. For now, anyway. So, you married little Judy Heppleway. Yes, I did. - No offence.|Judy was always the campus queen. I figured she'd wind up marrying|someone like Cary Grant. No, she just married me.|- I think she did just fine. So do I. - And so do I.|- Little Judy Heppleway. If you don't mind, her name's Kimball,|because she married me. Now, that's a perfectly good name.|- Bertie, what are you doing here? Just flew in from Phoenix for|a little business swindle. - Swindle? You should put on dry clothes.|Let's go to your little country club and some lunch, so we|can really talk. - Oh, marvellous! I'm so glad to see you.|- Are we invited too? Oh, sure, come along.|- Come on, George. Tell me, what do you do these days?|- As a matter of fact, I'm in oil. Oil? Isn't it fascinating? It's marvellous tax-wise. The first 27.5 percent|go right into your pocket. - Really? People always belly-aching about|needing money should all get into oil. It would certainly wipe out poverty. What's your line of business, George? I'm with Connell Electronics.|- Are you on the big board? - No. We're not on the little board either. It's a small company,|Bert, but it's very important. They manufacture a little transistor|about this big. This big. Anyway,|as George said in a speech once: Without it, a whole city|like Pittsburgh would be blacked out. From what I've seen of Pittsburgh,|it'd look better blacked out. It's true. - Tell me, Bert,|did your wife come with you? My wife? I'm not married. What? Bert Power, I don't believe you.|- Well, it's true. How did you escape?|- Well, if you really must know, it's partly your fault, passion girl. Mine?|- Yeah. After you threw me over|I couldn't settle for second-best. Excuse me, please.|I'll powder my nose. George, your nose needs a little powder too.|- Yeah, yeah. I'll be right back. Why don't you|order for me, passion girl? I'd like the chef salad,|vinegar, no oil. What is it? - Our worries are over.|- What? - We found a man for Judy. Who? Who? Bert Power, of course. Are you mad? Judy, married to|that cornball? Why, I'd live first! Judy doesn't think he's a cornball.|And he's loaded, George, loaded! Do you want everybody here to know?|- How much time do you have to look? I'm sorry. But,|even if you find somebody you like, how do you know he'll go for Judy?|- Are you kidding? That's impossible. Nothing's impossible. Two girls|turned me down before Ruth said yes. One even laughed in my face. Well... It should make Judy happy. And you know... Welcome back, gentlemen.|- Glad to be back, Bert old man. There's a dinner dance here tonight. Why don't you come along|as my and Judy's guest? That's very kind of you,|considering I'm not even deductible. I'll take care of the champagne.|- Great! Just great! I've never seen anything greater|than Bert's backhand. And those drives off the tee,|every one was over 350 yards. Wasn't it a pleasure,|playing bridge with him? Did you ever see|such a polished player? - Oh, he's alright.|- Alright? Why are you acting so nonchalant?|You were very happy to see him. Of course I was happy, very surprised. - Come on,|you couldn't keep your eyes off him. How could I help it? He was there|all afternoon. Remember, darling, it was your suggestion|to play tennis and golf and bridge. As a matter of fact, you insisted.|Didn't you? What's gotten into you?|- What? Normally, if I spent so much time|with a man you'd be wildly jealous. Me?|- You always have been. I'm not the jealous type at all. Remember the Brinkhoff's party,|when Larry helped me on with my coat? Helped you on with your coat?|He was helping himself. You see, you were jealous.|- Of course I was jealous. And wouldn't you be furious|if I weren't? - Heck, yeah. Hey, I have to get my shower.|- Not yet. If I don't hurry we'll miss the dance.|- Wouldn't be the first one we missed. You shouldn't have invited Bert. Your loving husband,|the late George Kimball. In here, Arnold. I need help, I can't manage this.|- Later. I want you to hear something. What are you doing?|- Listen. One... two... three... What's this?|- Wait. "My dearest Judy, by the time you hear this tape,|I will be dead. Yes,|my hypochondria has finally paid off. Forgive the jest, but as you see,|I retain my sense of humor to the end. My darling, I want to tell you|how much I love you and how much happiness|you gave me during our marriage. When I found out that I was dying|I had great anxieties about you and your future welfare. It was for this reason|that I felt you should remarry, and that Bert|would make an ideal husband. I'm telling you all this|so you'll feel no guilt whatsoever about marrying Bert. After whatever is considered|a decent interval by your bridge club. And now, my dearest, I must close. With sincerest wishes|for your future happiness, your loving husband, the late George Kimball." Oh, it's beautiful, It's just beautiful. Hey, Arnold, would you take it easy?|You've been hitting the bottle hard. Yes, and I'll keep hitting it too.|I don't know how else to handle this. Quiet. Judy's upstairs.|- I'm sorry. George?|- What? - Do me. - Yeah. Come on. I want to tell you|how proud I am of you. The wonderful thing you're doing|for Judy. So unselfish and ennobled. I mean, actually fixing your wife up|with another man. Does it bother you|that Judy may marry this guy and, you know, the...|- You mean...? Yeah.|- No, Arnold! She wouldn't think of it. All she needs now is a companion. Someone to walk with,|over the hill and down the other side. That's a beautiful thought. I'm going to miss you, bud.|- I know you will, buddy. You know something, old buddy?|The fact that the end is near seems to have sharpened my senses.|See this tree here, Arnold? Not too well, George. It's beautiful. Such strength. It's magnificent. And this table. It feels so good|just to run your hand over it. It's so smooth and cool. Well, all this is coming|a little late for me, this awareness. Why couldn't I have felt like this|every day of my life? But you still|have life ahead of you, Arnold. Arnold? Wake up! Feel alive,|appreciate the beauty around you. Don't you understand what I mean?|- Yeah, sure. Every chance I get,|I'm going to feel a table. Oh, boy, smooth. Do you know that|we haven't danced once? - I know. What's the matter? Aren't you feeling well? - I'm fine.|- Then why don't you ask me to dance? I mean, for me I feel fine. That's not|what you'd really call fine. Why don't you ask Bert to dance again?|- We've danced... - He's marvellous! Oh really? Have you danced with him? No. He must be a marvellous dancer.|He does everything so well. Hi, are you with us? - Sure.|- Darling, do you know George Kimball? No.|- George, this is Linda Bullard. It's so nice to meet you.|I've met your wife at the supermarket. Yes, she mentioned it. Would you boys excuse me a minute?|I must phone the sitter at home. I won't be a minute, Darling. Why don't you ask me how|it's going? - Alright, how's it going? A-Okay. Green. If you here of any prospects,|let me know. Saturday dance night at the club|is always good for a split-up or two. You appreciate the life around you?|Do you, John? I mean, did you ever really look|at a tree? John! It's magnificent. Did you ever feel a table? Wake up! Live your life! Hi, George. I love you, George.|- She's such a sweet little woman. She's just like Judy.|- Who, George? She's falling into the trap|of that small-time lecher. What time, George? I should do something. - Do what?|- Just one good deed before I go. Go where, George?|- Strange, the way facing the great adventure|changes all your moral values. How, George? I'm going to do it.|- Do what, George? When, George? It's so smooth. I won't be home any later than 1:30. Alright. Fine. Bye-bye. May I talk to you for a moment,|please, in private? Of course, Mr. Kimball.|- Good. In here. Does this have a familiar ring?|- What? "Look, I know your next few weeks|are going to be tough. You're going to be lonely.|Say, how would it be if we had a nice quiet little drink|together some night?" Please go on, Mr. Kimball. Mr. Kimball, you just don't know|how grateful I am to you. You prevented me from making|a complete fool of myself. How can I ever thank you?|- Oh, you don't have to thank me. I'll never forget you for this. Never. Judy! May I help you, Mr. Kimball?|- No. Judy! Judy, wait! Please, let me explain.|- That'll take some explaining. Kissing that woman in the checkroom!|- That was Linda Bullard. - What? Yes. I was trying to tell her... No wonder|the Bullards are splitting up! Judy, this isn't our car. Don't try to change the subject.|- Judy, wait. Probably by now the|whole town knows. Everybody but me. What on earth are you talking about?|- It all fits now. What fits now? Shoving me off on Bert, so you|don't feel guilty with another woman. What do you mean?|- Trying to send me to night school, so you can have your evenings free.|- You're making a terrible mistake. I'm leaving you, George Kimball!|I won't spend another night under the same roof with a swinger.|- Swinger? - You're a playboy and an adulterer!|- Judy, I have something to tell you. Give me those keys!|- Move over. Then say it. And please|take the lipstick off your face. I didn't want to tell you this,|but you have to know the truth. I won't have you thinking|I'm unfaithful to you. Especially now, at the ebb-tide of my life. It's true,|I was trying to match you with Bert. But for a completely unselfish reason,|that I wanted you to have somebody. Have somebody?|- After I'm gone. So that's it.|You're going away with Linda Bullard, that's what.|- I'm not going with anyone. Remember yesterday, when I saw|Dr. Morrissey about my chest pain? You mean your indigestion? Yes. Well, I lied to you. Judy, my time is up. That's right, time for another pill.|- I'm serious. I'm dying. The ticker. George, if you don't stop... It's true. Call Ralph, he'll tell you. I may only have|a few more weeks to live. There, there. Chin up. Isn't it better|than having another woman? It's enough, Arnold.|I'll park here for a while. Arnold, turn me around a bit.|I'd like to look at my tree. That's fine. - If you need anything,|I'll be mowing your back lawn. I already mowed your front lawn.|- Oh, that is beautiful, Arnold. Hi, darling.|- Hi. - How are you feeling? Well, perhaps|a little weaker than yesterday. I think sitting here is weakening me. But we put you in it to conserve|your strength. - I know, but... And I've got the tickets.|Flight 17, leaving at 7:45 a.m. When we arrive in Rochester|there'll be a limousine at the airport to take us|directly to the Mayo Clinic. I think it's useless.|- Useless? George, nothing is useless! Lt'll be so costly. I don't care. - It'll just prolong it.|I'll just lie there and linger. One of the most expensive things|is to linger. I don't care about expense.|We'll spend every cent if we have to. Arnold! Thank you, Arnold. Did you reach Dr. Morrissey?|- No. Not even his answering service.|- You've kidding! - No. Oh, Arnold. And to think that|I accused him of being unfaithful, when his motives|were so unselfish, so noble. That's one heck of a guy|you got there, Judy. When they made George Kimball|they threw away the mold. Still no answer. I dialled right|through to Dr. Morrissey. - Me too. At a time like this he goes fishing!|Doesn't care for George at all. Just wait till I see him. Sit up, sweetheart.|It's good and hot. Alright, now back. Okay? Judy, you really surprise me.|- Do I? You've always been so dependent,|and you're taking this like a Trojan. I never had to do it before.|You always took care of everything. Know something? If I had known|I would have told you right away. You should have. Promise you'll never|keep anything from me again. I won't. We certainly have had|wonderful times, haven't we? So wonderful. Remember the little Chinese restaurant|just off Grant Avenue? Yes. Where we first met.|- Met? It was a pick-up. Was not.|- Was too. You were just sitting there alone|trying to decide what to order... And you walked over and said,|"Excuse me, I'm here with two friends, and we're entitled to wan-tan soup,|barbequed ribs and almond duck. But if we have a fourth,|we also get chicken Canton..." You see? Yeah,|I guess it was a pick-up. Be right back, sweetheart. Hi. I saw your lights on, and thought|I'd see if you want some fish. No, thank you, Ralph. Please, Judy, you've got to take some.|I've got a carload out there. Oh, really, Ralph?|How nice for you. Isn't it wonderful that you can forget|everything and go off like that? Yeah, it doesn't happen often.|Fortunately, I had nothing urgent. Nothing urgent? A patient|who may be dying isn't urgent? What?|- Look, all I can say is, I have never been so disillusioned|with anyone in my whole life. And you may as well know the truth:|I'm taking you off the case. You're taking me off what case?|- That's right. I guess I've been|out in the hot sun too long. The fact that you|didn't want to tell me is one thing. But to go off and leave George|when he's... dying. Oh, Ralph!|- Did I hear you right, Judy? Did you say George was dying?|- Oh, stop it, Ralph! I know all about it. I'm flying|him to the Mayo Clinic tomorrow. But... Ralph Morrissey, how can you laugh|at a time like this? I've encountered hypochondriacs|in my time, but never one like him! Ralph,|you mean it isn't true? He had a complete check-up|just two weeks ago. - I know. George Kimball will outlive us all,|unless he worries himself to death. Then there's nothing wrong with him?|- Absolutely nothing. I told him that|in my office on Friday. Oh, how could he do this to me?|Why would he say he's dying? I don't know.|I'm not a psychiatrist. But, boy, they make a fortune!|- What possible reason could he have? Well, maybe... I don't know!|- Why did he say a thing like this? Oh. Of course... Of course!|- What? - I'll tell you why. Because I suspected him of|having an affair with another woman. And when I accused him he thought|he could cover it up with this lie. My advice to any wife in this|situation is, forget it. - Forget it? Although, to the best of my knowledge|nobody's ever accepted that advice. And I won't be the first.|- That's what I thought. Would you like some fish?|They're awfully good for you! No, I hate fish! Then I guess I'll have to|eat the little fellas myself. Oh, my darling,|are you having another nightmare? No, honey, I...|- There, sweetheart. I think somebody hit me. It's alright, darling,|I'm here now. It's such a hot night,|I'll slip into something comfortable. Yes... I suddenly feel so warm. And damp. Oh, you poor angel! Isn't that the perfume|I gave you for our anniversary? Almost. The one I exchanged|for the one you gave me. It's such a hot night. Remember our 5th anniversary?|- Remember? I made notes! We came home right after dinner. It was a night just like tonight. Full moon. We had champagne on the patio. Isn't it a shame we can't|do the same tonight? - Why not? Darling, your condition.|You don't have the strength. Believe me, I'll find the strength. Well... I think there's champagne|in the refrigerator. I'll get it. I'll get it! Darling, didn't we have music? No, but I think I hummed a little. You're sweet,|I really don't need a wheelchair. Darling,|you need to conserve your strength. You're a sweetheart... Judy, let me in! Judy, What's going on? Will you let me in?|- Stop that banging down there. What are you doing? You'll wake the... dead! But what's wrong? Ask Dr. Morrissey! What'd you do that for?|Will you let me in? I'll catch my death of a cold. Good. Be sure to give it to Linda! Oh, my cold pills. Hey, George. Thanks.|- Would you open up the door? You want to come in?|- Yes. I'll open the door. I love champagne.|How did you know I ran out of booze? How'd you get so wet? - Oh, shut up,|and get me some dry pyjamas. I just finished your eulogy.|Let me read it to you. I don't want to hear it.|- Yes, you do, listen: "They needed a good sport in heaven, so they sent for George Kimball. Yes, George Pommerton Kimball..."|- Arnold! - "the best..." I don't want to hear it. We're rather testy, aren't we?|- Yes, we certainly are. Well, I guess I'll have to|make a little change here. "Unfailing good humor." Sorry, George. Judy has thrown me out of the house.|- Judy, George? Thrown you out of the house, George?|Why, George? Is that the best you've got?|- Yes, till the laundry comes back. I know Judy.|She wouldn't do that without a reason. Well, she saw a woman|kissing me in the checkroom. "Faithful and devoted husband."|- Don't be ridiculous. It was all perfectly innocent... Well,|it's too long a story to go into now. I'm going to sleep in the kids' room, Okay? - It's|being painted while they're gone. You'll have to shack up with me.|- Oh, marvellous! The least a man can ask|is to die in his own bed. Which side do you sleep on? - I sleep|here, Ruth sleeps by the window. So does Judy. What are you doing?|I like fresh air when I'm sleeping. I will not be poisoned|by damp night air. "Courtesy and consideration." Egad, you've got cold feet!|- Complaints, nothing but complaints! I could complain a little, too!|You ever cut your toenails? There she is,|probably sleeping peacefully. And she has the nerve to accuse me...|- I don't know, George. Methinks you complain too much.|- Don't play holier-than-thou! You weren't just making eyes|at that waitress in Miami. I have a good mind|to tell Ruth when she gets back. "Loyal friend." Keep it up, buddy. You'll have|the shortest eulogy on record. Who? What? Yeah, Douglas 2-0-0-2-4.|- That's my number! That's what he wanted.|- Who? Winnie. Winnie Burr.|- Winnie Burr? What'd you give it to him for? Hi, Winnie. I heard the horrible news.|Well, I'm just heartbroken. Who told you? The milkman? Yes, Winnie, I'm afraid it's true. No, no, I don't think there's|anything you can do to patch it up. Well, I guess|the next few weeks will be tough. Lonely? I imagine I will be. Quiet drink? Tonight? Look, Winnie,|will you call back later? The nerve! Oh, good morning, Mr. Kimball.|Excuse me for laughing, but you look great for a doomed man.|- How do you know... - Dr. Morrissey. Would you give this to Mr. Nash?|Thank you. I'm sure it'd look better on him. Milkman! Good morning. Of course I'm glad I'm going to live. But it's just one lousy way|of finding out. You doctors should have a way|to tell a patient nothing's wrong so he's sure there's nothing wrong!|Does Judy know? What? She thinks I'm covering up an affair. No, I don't want any fish! I took off so much, I'd better|put some back in. - Forget it. What's the matter, George?|- I'm going to live. That's the way to talk.|That's the old fighting... You don't understand. Dr. Morrissey|just told me I'm perfectly alright. There's not a thing wrong with me. You mean, you're not dying?|- That's right. - That's wonderful. Oh, thank heavens, George. Was it a mistake in the X-rays?|They discover a new drug? It was all a misunderstanding.|It was all my fault. But you told me the old ticker...|- I know, but I was wrong. And I'm sorry. You should be! Damn it! I've been drinking for 3 days on|account of you, I'm just recovering. On top of that I spent 2 days|and 2 nights writing your eulogy. And now you're not even dying!|- I'm sorry. Well, I feel like an idiot!|Crying, drinking, writing and mowing. Arnold, I said I'm sorry. - It's a|horrible thing to do to a friend! News flash:|She's packing to leave for Reno. Listen, he's got to go some time. "Your loving husband,|the late George Kimball." When was that dashed off? Right after|you concocted that wild dying bit? No, Judy, I...|- An affair is bad enough, but to cover it up with this lie!|To think he almost made a fool of me. I was taking him to the Mayo Clinic.|- You were a real brick, Judy. I'll tell my wife when she's a brick.|- Bert, what did he hope to gain? He knew he'd be found out eventually.|Couldn't he see I'd get suspicious? Judy, I told you, I took a pill...|- How could he get out of this? Sooner or later he'd give you|the old story of a mistake in X-rays or the discovery of a new drug.|- And I would've believed it too. But one thing went wrong,|didn't it George? The Doctor went fishing and couldn't|back up your "old ticker" story. And by accident, you saw|Dr. Morrissey first. - Exactly! Do you mind if I put some clothes on? Why can't you wear shoes,|like everybody else? Well, she's really leaving me.|- Tonight the window stays open. Arnold, you're a lawyer.|You've seen these things. How can a man convince his wife|that he's not having an affair? He can't. - But I'm not having one.|- Doesn't make any difference. Isn't a man innocent until proven|guilty? - Look, boy, it's your wife. You mean there's nothing I can do?|- There is one thing. - What? Confess. And ask her to forgive you. For what? - For the affair.|- When I'm not having one? - Right. Guys lie out of affairs, but|I'd be the first guy to lie into one. Face the facts. You know you're not|having an affair, she's sure you are. Why be stubborn? Admit it.|- Well, I don't know... Judy loves you. But she's a woman.|What woman doesn't want to see her husband crawl?|- Do you really think it would work? Yes! Women spend their lives trying|to get something on their husbands! Alright, Arnold, I'll take the advice.|I'll confess that I've had an affair, beg her forgiveness,|and that'll be that. - It's not easy. What more does she want? Plenty. They always want to know:|Who was she? How does she look? How old is she? Do you love her?|Did any of Judy's friends see you together?|- They ask all that? Yes. And what is most important:|Was it worth it? Was it?|- No, no matter how great it was, you say it wasn't so good. I can't answer those questions. You've got to. If you hem and haw she'll think you have dozens,|and can't keep them straight. No, Sir,|you've got to snap out those answers. Just like that? - I'm telling you|what can happen when you cop a plea. I'm not copping a plea.|I'm an innocent man. Arnold, she's really leaving! I've got to stop her.|- Wait, bud. Let's take my car. Alright, Arnold. "Just confess. Confess everything. Lay it on good and thick.|She'll eat it up." Judy, don't do anything wrong!|- Let go! - Don't do anything rash! I lied to you|and I've decided to confess everything and beg for your forgiveness. Judy, please. - I was right.|You are having an affair. Yes, and I'm a rat.|- Oh, you are! - Judy, please. Let go of me. - Isn't it better|to discuss it like civilised people? Oh yes, it's better, dear. It happened to me, and I...|- Will you keep out of this? Alright, let's discuss it. - You ask|and I'll snap out the answers. Alright. Who is she? And it isn't Linda Bullard.|- It isn't Linda? No. I spoke to Linda, and she told me|all about Winston Burr. As a matter of fact, he called me too. But that's beside the point.|Who is she? Her name is Dolores. Dolores who? Dolores... Yellowstone. Dolores Yellowstone?|- Yes. Where did you meet her?|- At a health food restaurant. Is she young?|- Yes. What is she, a chorus girl,|a stripper or something? Certainly not! She's a|marine biologist at the aquarium. Did any of my friends see|you two together? - Of course not. And, by the way,|she wasn't worth the trouble. Oh, who asked you for that? - No one.|I just threw it in as a bonus. When will you see her again?|- Never. - Never? It's over, finished. We broke up. Do you expect me to believe that?|- Well, it's true. Don't you know|I can always tell when you're lying? I'm telling the truth.|I'm never going to see her again. I repent. I loathe her.|- I don't believe you've broken up. It's true. I sent Dolores to New York,|to start a new life. What do you mean?|- Well, she didn't want to go. She was broke.|I insisted that she go. I gave her money,|and put her on that plane. Oh, really, George? - Yes.|- How much did you give her? Well, I don't remember exactly. Yes, I do. I'll prove it to you. Here it is, a check made out to cash. $1,000, and that's the end of Dolores. What? And you were nagging|about the price of ham! It was worth it to save our marriage.|- Well, it won't work, I'll tell you that right now.|- What do you mean? I was waiting to buy a ticket.|I was on my way to see a lawyer. But then I started to think,|am I doing the right thing? George has never lied before. Maybe I should believe him.|So I didn't buy a ticket. But now that you confessed,|George, it's all over. I can't live with you another minute.|There's just no love left. I feel nothing for you but... pity. Yes, I certainly am to be pitied. I don't suppose it would do any good|if I deny the whole thing over again? What? - If I tell you|I never had another woman, and I just made it up hoping you'd|forgive me? - Please, don't do it! You'd just show your contempt|for me. I'm going home to pack. And don't you try to follow me!|Goodbye, George. Where are you, George?|There you are. Well, it worked, huh? I told you to confess and it worked.|It didn't work? Not even a bit? It failed totally?|You're going to hit me, right? No, you're not going to hit me.|But you'll hurt me. George, please! Excuse me, is Mr. Kimball in?|- No. - Are you Mrs. Kimball? Yes, but I'm very busy. - If you|don't mind, I'll handle this with you. This is the deed. Since he gave us|this check for $1,000 made out to cash I thought he should have this receipt. He gave you a $1,000 check?|- Yes, he did. - For what? For your plot in Green Hills.|You must go up there with your hubby. It's lovely now. Everything's|in bloom. - Just a minute, please. My husband bought a cemetery plot?|- Yes. Didn't he tell you? No. Oh dog-gone it! I could tear my tongue|out! He wanted it to be a surprise. I hope this doesn't take the joy out.|- No, not at all. So, he did make up that confession.|There is no other woman. No. But he|made arrangements for another man. Mr. Kimball was very thoughtful.|He made provisions for a 2nd husband. It's a very unique idea. In fact,|we're using it in our advertising. I hope Mr. Kimball won't be angry|because I let this slip out. Oh, I got it, Mr...? - Akins.|- Suppose we don't tell him? Just mail these to him, Okay?|He'll never know that I found out. Good! Then he can still surprise you.|- Yes. - You're a good egg! Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Akins. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't worry, I'll slip out the back. Don't be a stranger. Will you at least let me|drive you to the station? Suppose I told you|I changed my mind about leaving you? What about my affair with Dolores? I've decided to forgive you.|- You have? - Yes. Don't you move! Hi, Ju... George! Who was that? It was the florist. Sort of. Oh, George, what was that?|- A thorn. Have we got any iodine?|- No.
