Don't know when to keep it's head down. So there it is, rustling around the leaves, see, he think, uh, under the cover of the brush, them hawks ain't gonna see him. Tickling the grass... Then, bam! A bullet straight to heaven. Hmm. Mm, five big ones, little. Ruth is my friend. What'd you say? You're gonna pay for your sinnin'. She told me she wasn't the first. First? She can't tell you nothin'. Who been talkin' them lies? Your preacher? Angels. Get her, boy. Rabbit's running. Go ahead now, there ain't nowhere safe. Hawk is gonna find you. Hmm. Hi, there. I reckon you ran up front side of a nail. Yeah, I think so. I tried calling for help, but... Yeah, that wouldn't work when you need it to, now would it? No, I guess not. Well, let me have a little look, take a see what you've got here. Thank you. Well, yep. It's on there. Yeah, I did my best. Y'all them folk what moved up to caperwood. Yeah, we are. It's a good old house. Good old house. Yeah, it is. Far cry from the city, huh? Yeah, it's beautiful. Well, along with our pristine roads, people say we famous for our views. Thank you so much. -What do I owe you? -No, ma'am. No, I could not have done this myself. Ah. You could've. And you would have too. Besides, I'd hate to have to haul you in for bribing an officer of the law before you all even get settled. Okay. Thank you again. Ma'am, excuse me. What is that right there? It's a birthmark. Good day. Oh, ma'am? One thing i might should say, being as y'all ain't from around here, not all places fit for visit. What do you mean? Well, there's some strange folk around here. They made their life on their own, god bless them, and they not be disturbed, is all. Wh-- ah! Hey, babe. Hey, sweetie. Where you been? Oh, don't ask. Had a little bit of a disaster. Hi. -Mmm. -I missed you. Aw. I missed you too. I blew a tire though, that's why I'm late. I'm sorry. Ah, please tell me you didn't change it. No. I actually tried to, but then a local came by and helped me. Oh, wow. He was a little creepy, he still did it. Yeah, and I almost cut off my finger. You almost cut off your finger? Yeah, perils of house work. Oh, look at you, tough guy. Yeah, watch out. Your nails getting dirty. -Right? -I like it. So, uh, what are you making tonight? Uh, I was gonna make something called, "my husband's making dinner for me." Job well done today. Yeah, thanks. We're like, 20% done. I think we're finally where we need to be. This really feels like home. -Cheers. -Cheers. Ah! Hi! Oh, it's so good to see you. Great to see you. This is Dave. Hi, Dave. Sarah. -Congratulations. -Thank you so much. Thank you for coming. This is my husband. -Matt. -How are you doing? Dave. Yeah, pleasure. -You... -I know, I'm huge. I'm huge. Come here, come on, i wanna show you. Oh my god, I'm so jealous. Oh, don't be, please. It's yours anytime. You just say the word. Well, it's actually the bank's. - But, lest let facts get in the way. And this one too, of course, if he plays his cards right. Oh, okay. No pressure. So... this is where we're gonna do it. Uh... do it? Yeah, that's where the magic happens. Yeah, we've already got the midwife, and of course, my favorite doctor is going to be on-call. Oh, so you're giving birth here? That's the plan, fingers crossed. You guys, this is really wonderful I'm-- I'm really excited for you guys. Thank you. We're pretty happy. Okay, I wanna show you the rest of the house. Come here. -Excuse us. -Thank you. You, sir? Thirsty? Absolutely. Oh, he's really cute. My god. Yeah, yeah, well done. So, any tips for a new local? Oh, uh, soda's fine. Okay. Uh, sorry, tips for a local? Yeah, Sarah says you grew up around here. Oh, more like 50 miles south, closer to the city. Oh, yeah, it's a different world out here. Yeah, it's interesting. I hear you play football. Used to. Had a ride back at state, till I threw my back out. Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that. -And now? -Personal trainer. Play a little touch on the weekends, if I'm feeling frisky. Oh, nice. Yeah, back trauma's no joke. And the list gets scarier with football players. Count your blessings. -Cheers. -Cheers. So, how long has it been since you've seen them, then? Every other month or so, maybe. -I don't know. -That's great. That means this medicine's actually working then. Yeah, I mean I'm not-- I'm not gonna embarrass you, or anything, if that's what you're worried about. No. That is not-- you have never embarrassed me. -That's not what i meant at all. -I know. You know, I've had my own issues with seeing things. I know, I know. It's just-- it's just weird. You live with these people since you're a kid, and then, a doctor comes along, and tells you that they're not real. That it doesn't exist, and to take this medicine, and it's gonna make you all better. And... and then everyone's gone. I'm not gone. I'm not going anywhere. Matt's not going anywhere. Dave seems pretty real. I mean, that guy-- wow, he seems really real. I think I really like him. Good, I'm really looking forward to getting to know-- no fucking way. Whoo! Nice digs! This place is sick. Hey. What the hell, stranger? Ah, you know, i figured you invited us, and what kind of uncle would I be if I didn't show up? Hi. I did invite you. That was about five months ago though, and you were supposed to rsvp. Well, if rsvp means show up with dirty laundry, then we did just that. -That's exactly what it means. -Yeah. Hey, I want you to meet the Pearl of my life. This is Skye. Skye, this is my sister, Sarah. -Hey, god you are gorgeous. -Oh, thank you. Dude, thank you for letting us crash. -So cool of you. -You are so welcome. And this right here is Sabrina the teenage bruja. All grown up. Hey, it looks like you've come a long way. Hi, thank you very much. Yeah, that is ours right there. -We love her. Don't we? -Mm-hmm. You own it, huh? Is that doctor Matt over there? Hey, we're gonna go get cleaned up real quick, all right? What's for lunch, bud? You don't have to worry about embarrassing me now, because my brother's here. Hi. Hey, hey-- white wine? Oh, no, this is apple juice. I just like to pretend. Oh, rad. What kind of clothes? Uh, casual work wear, that's what i call it anyway. It's like, light wools and stitched patterns. -Cool. Like um, this? -Yeah, like this, actually. Nice, I like it. So, you really think I'd enjoy burning man? Bro, would you enjoy the true freedom of the mind? Yeah, it's a good little clinic. Only about 20 intakes a day. Well, that'll be a change. Yeah, I can't wait. See the life's good good for your 20s, but after it gets a little crazy. Well, it's perfect for you guys. Yeah, we've been just like, traveling around for the last six months. Yeah, Eric said like Oregon, Arizona. Oh, Arizona was amazing. The red rocks are so groovy. We're trying to get down to the golf coast for summer. Those cute towns. -Cute towns. -Yes, those cute towns. -I wanna see them. -So cute. -Oh, I like your charm. -Oh, right on, yeah. I got this at this little flea market in tahoma, you know? And it kinda like-- well, it kinda drew us here, you know? Have you been out to the woods yet? Oh, no, we haven't had time yet. Does the doctor not want to pitch a tent? Do you guys need anything? -No, I'm good, baby. -All right. I'm good, thank you. -How great is she? -Yeah. Yeah, she seems really sweet. She is. When are you planning on getting home? Well, this is it. Oh, come on, don't-- don't give me that look. All right? I'm not trying to move into your big house with too many rooms. Our home is this slab that we rolled in on. That's our home now. -You're gonna live in the Van? -Yeah. Yeah, I mean, besides, we can't really, um, we can't really go back to the apartment, you know, we haven't paid rent since like, November. But, no, but-- the walls were getting small, -and it was-- it was really like-- -Jesus, Eric. I don't know, the energy wasn't there. -You know? -Okay. Have you thought about getting a job? Yeah. Yeah, I mean... I don't know, you know, it's like-- life is about living, you know? Living. Yeah, living takes money, Eric. Food, gas. We'll be all right. I always am, you know that. Ahem. Look at you, grill master. Yeah, it's actually all local. -Yeah? Cool. -Yeah. - Would you like one? -Uh, -I'm actually a veg. -You're a veg. -Yeah. -Damn, I wish i would have known. -No, dude, it's cool. -No, hold tight. Um, I think I might have something for you. Don't like go out of your way for me, or anything. Not a problem. I hope that that's enough to carry you for a little bit. Oh, babe, it's more than enough. Thank you. Babe, do you have any of that pasta left? Hey, you need a beer, or something? -Uh, I'm good. -All right. Really? What am I supposed to do? This is such a quaint little spread. Who would have thought that big city elitism would travel so cool to the country, huh? Yeah, well, that big city elitism is financing your dirtbag life. Hey, so, uh, Matt, i see you still got dad's old Jeep. Yeah, it's a work horse. Hauled some brush off the road with it last weekend. I always thought that doctor's all drove audis. - You know? -Well, this doctor doesn't. But that's just because he's made some sacrifices for me and our family. The baby is the only thing that matters to us. Probably the rest of it will come in time. Audi's included, okay? Does anybody mind if I freshen up? It's been, like, a lot longer than i care to admit. Yeah, yeah, you can come in, here. There you go. Hey, uh, you okay? Uh, yeah, yeah. I think i just fell asleep. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I heard her scream, i went to help. I didn't think she was gonna be half naked. Well, you didn't seem to mind either. Well, I was checking on our guest. What's your deal? I don't know. I'm sorry. I've been having these really weird thoughts lately about us, and the move, and the baby, and-- it's okay. We're fine. Sit down. You know the baby is perfect. Every test we've done, every sonogram, they've all said the same thing. -I just-- -yeah, you just what? I don't know how to explain it. When I was on the road yesterday, the trees, and the clouds, and there were these wildflowers everywhere. And things just, they move so quickly, you know? Time just passes, and life is-- it's so precious, it's so fragile. It's like, it's gone so quickly. Hey, look at me. We're the lucky ones. Other people, they, they go through life, and they don't have what we have. We're strong because we have each other. I know. I just want her to life a long happy life. Yeah, well she will. I promise. I will personally make sure of it. I just love her so much, you know? Yeah. I would do anything for her. Everything's gonna be fine. I know. It was a man. What kind of man? Dark hair, beard-- long beard. Eyes like fire. Eyes like fire? Did he say anything to you? No. Did you say anything to him? Mm. No, I don't think so. I don't really remember. I don't want to talk about it anymore. Okay, copy that. I'm gonna give you a pass this time. But this is... This is some good stuff. "The angels visited again last night. They talked to me. I wasn't scared." Nice night for a walk. All right, here it goes. You got it. Yeah, right? And the game is over. Okay, you do it. I'll watch. Eric. Ready? Ready? Oh, shit, sorry. -Outside. -It's good. - Wow. - -My bad. I just wanted more time to kiss. Hey! Right there. Under the vines. One surprise after another. Yeah, you guys live on a cemetery, that's awesome. It's not a cemetery, it's a plot. My god, Matt, she was so young. All right, guys, come on, I know this is a bummer, right? But, hey, we're alive, so we should live. We're here to have fun, i mean we showed up. She's not going anywhere. You can come back and visit her later. Come on, first one to the beer wins! So, we check into the haunted hotel in Portland, right? And I guess, like, the ninth floor is the most haunted. And so, what floor do they put us on, but the ninth. --You really believe that crap? Dude, all along the coast, we stopped at these plantations to hunt. To hunt? For ghosts. Oh, yeah, right. -Seriously, bro. -Oh, no, seriously. No, let me show you. -Boom. -What's that? Ah, e.V.P. Recorder. It stands for "electronic voice phenomena." -And you use that to-- -to hunt ghosts. - Oh. -Laugh if you want, but I'm telling you, have you guys ever been into slave quarters before? It's crazy. Okay? They got these like, four foot ceilings, and they got these like chains hanging off the walls, and I'm telling you, you can feel it. I mean, these spirits, they want to be heard. You hear them? Yeah. Take a listen. Eric. Hey. Oh, sorry. --What the hell is this? -You don't hear it? -Well, no, I hear it, I just don't hear... it. You're not listening, bro. Yeah, bro. Well, I'm done listening for today. If you don't believe me, ask Sarah. Ask her what? Ask her if she believes in ghosts. Stop it, Eric. What? You-- you've never told him? Tell me what? When we were kids-- stop. When you were kids, what? When we were kids, there were ghosts in our house. Were there? It was two days before our sixth birthday, and they came for us. They came for you? Yeah. And you know what saved us? Butterflies? What happened happened, all right? There's no reason to deny it. Don't be a dick, Eric. I'm not trying to be a dick. I'm sorry, I didn't-- Sarah, come on. You know, it's hard to believe that she's related to you. Why's that? Well, for one thing, she's loving, she's kind, considerate-- pretty much all the things that you're not. Wow. Well, I guess everybody has to have their opposite, right? That's probably why she chose you. There is some good ghost fodder up in these mountains. Yeah? What do you mean? There was a serial killer back in the 70s. Who? Newspapers called him, "cannibal Kane." Said he mutilated his victims, then ate them. Some weird satanic something-or-other. -They caught him, right? -Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Creepy to know that there's people like that in jail getting old like us. Well, not anymore. Well, he got out? No, no, no, no. He died. The prisons burned down back in the 80s. It was like, this big story around here. Something like 100 people were trapped inside, -died in their cell. -We need to check that out. -Yeah, we do. -What? Yeah, it's a perfect night, a full moon. Oh, excuse me. Wait, you want to take us to a burnt out prison in the middle of no where, -yeah. -At night, because it's a full moon? Somehow a full moon makes that a good idea? If you wanna go now, there's still daylight left. But, um, the only thing is that the ghosts don't come out until night. Oh that's right, that's in your ghost hunting manual, right? I-- I have always wanted to see that place. -I'm sorry, what? -I-- I say we go, it'll be fun. Come on, Bree. In high school, all the kids used to go, it was like a dare. Kinda like, make out in the prison, kind of thing. - Ah. We could make some more recordings added to the box. Yes. -I don't wanna do this. -Come on. It'll be fun. Where's fun, Bree? Let's go. How about you, Matt? You game? Come on. Come on, if there's no ghosts, it's no big deal, right? You serious? Okay, uh, I'm in. -Yeah -yes. -Wow. -Baby, it's cool, it's fun. It's no big deal. A little adventure. Hey. Hey, where's that old crappy sweater I love? Why are you doing this? -It's gonna get cold. -That's not what I mean. What the hell was he talking about with the butterflies? Well, it's just Eric. I mean, I don't know, they probably just nested in the house, and then got out, go into our room somehow. Look, he tells his bullshit stories, and he travels around the world pissing away our money, and I'm over it. Now, this shit? Ghosts? Butterflies? Really? Oh, you never shared that with me. I want you brother out of here. Can you keep your voice down, please? I'm sorry about the check. I should have said something. Yeah, well, it's-- it's bigger than the check. It's everything. Not responding to your e-mails, blowing off your phone calls, and now the random showing up to crash whenever he wants? Telling more bullshit stories that are obviously bothering you. Well, how is this helping? I wanna see what he sees, and call bullshit on it. Finally chip away and this-- this myth he's built his entire life around. He's not your responsibility. Yeah, well, you are. And you're gonna be the mother of our child. Even though you were born two minutes before he was, you've been playing big sister for way too long. He's got to grow up. It starts today. That sweater? Thanks. Come back in an hour? You know, someday you're gonna realize that this isn't a mistake. What isn't a mistake? Who we are. The things we seen. The things that we've been shown. Sarah, you and i have a gift. Oh, I do have a gift. And you've managed to convince him to take this stupid hike. And if anything happens to him, I will kill you with my bare hands. Yes, ma'am. See ya later. Dave, uh-- you really know where we're going? Kinda... Oh, my god! That's really not cool. You should have seen your face, oh, my god that was hilarious. Don't do that again. Here. Why the hell would anybody build a prison out here? Why not? Probably safer out here than Alcatraz. How the hell would you find your way out of this place? -Welcome to prison. -Holy shit. Shut up. Unbelievable. I say we divide and conquer. Wow. -This place... -It's insane. It just keeps going. Hey. Look what I got. Look at you, prepared. Ah, yes. This place goes on for miles and-- oh, god, oh, jeez! - Jesus, not funny! -Come on. Is that good? Let's go get this cannibal motherfucker. You ready? You know I am. Help me. This is gonna be good. No, no, no. What, did you smoke too much? Uh, yeah, I think so. Hey, we don't have much time left to go down here, come on. Yeah, I don't-- i don't want to. Hey, Skye, babe, this is what we came for, -right here. -Yeah, I'm just-- I'm not feeling it, baby. Come on. Hey, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I'm gonna take real good care of you. All right, all right. Yeah. All right. Come on. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. You're so strong. All clear. Okay. Oh, this is the old mess hall. Okay, I'm done. We can go. We've seen this, right? Hey, it's just an old building, there's nothing you need to be scared of. -Okay? -All right. I just wanna go. I'm just done. Okay, all right. -No! -Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Baby, are you okay? Baby, you all right? Wh-- um, what-- what are those? It's nothing. Hey, look at me. Can we go now? No fucking way. Whoa. This is it. This is where those prisoners died. This is fucking it. You here with us, Kane? Kane, are you here? Wait. What the hell is that? I've read about these people up in the mountains. They developed their own kind of religion. Some sort of demonology based on voodoo and christianity and oral traditions all combined. "Sirrahana." Maybe sirrahana's their savior. More like their devil. Baby, look at this. "The lost return-- awakening of the dead and the end begins. Drawing the devil from out of the cycle." Hello? -Jesus. I don't like this, Eric. -Calm down. This isn't like anything we've ever experienced. -Please can we just go? -It's just our friends trying to play-- I don't fucking care, this place gives me the creeps, all right? Take some photos to prove we were here, and let's go. Okay. Okay. I love you. I love you too. You better. Eric! Oh, my god. What the fuck? Eric. Hey, hey, hey-- i need your help! Holy shit. Take him to a hospital. I can't, he's gonna bleed out. - Get off of him! You're killing him. Please, you're killing him. You're killing him! Eric! Hold up, hold up. Hang on, hang on. I got you, man. Relax. Calm down. He just stopped bleeding. I don't understand, dude. We just gotta get out of here. Sarah should be waiting for us. I still think it's safer in here than out there. What the fuck do you mean? Did you not see what just happened? Matt, I lived it. The only difference between you and me, is that I don't want to run from it. The difference is you're fucking insane. Okay? The side effect is you don't want to run. Stop fighting. Am I all alone here? Does anyone else see how fucking insane this is? I'm ready to go home. There's something down there, guys. It wants to be heard. It wants us to hear it. Don't you get that? You wanna stick around with a couple of flashlights, find out what it is? -Eric, please. -Okay, yeah. -We're going. -I'm not going. Baby, whatever's down there, it's not going anywhere. -Hey. -Fine, fine. We're coming back. Okay? Thank you so much. I need to get to a hospital immediately. I did not think that anybody was gonna stop. You was saying? Yeah, um... I was just saying thank you. Thank you so much. Nice night for a walk. Yeah. What the f-- oh, no. No, no, no... How the hell did we get back here? Like, I don't know, all right? -Will you just please-- -everybody please, just chill out, okay? What's going on? Maybe there's something in that book. What are you talking about? What book? What? Do you guys know something that I don't? What book? Here, take it. "To write to the offered-- on seducing the soul of the newborn a vessel will deliver the chosen." Okay, we, uh-- we have to get the hell out of here. How? There-- there has to be another path. We have to try again. Jesus, what kind of evil is in this place? Can somebody tell me what is happening? Is this real? Is this real-- calm down. We will find a way out of here. Eric, what are you doing? Eric! This is where we're supposed to be. Right here. This is the strongest signal I've ever gotten. Now, we were brought here for a reason. Now, I don't know about you guys, but I'm gonna go find out what that reason is. If you go down there, I'm not following you. Eric! Skye, let him go. My brother said that a pretty young woman's expecting just to settle in these parts. Um, my husband and our friends went over to look for that prison. That burned down? Yeah. Anyway, I was supposed to go get them, so, can we pick them up on the way? There's one good thing that came out of that fire at least. It killed that devil preacher Kane. Killed him good. We heard about him. Most have. Move in these parts had-- had someone they love pulled off into the next world by his bush axe. That man had no good in him. Pure evil, he was. How did they catch him? It weren't no "they." -Captain got him. -The captain? Well, he ain't been there for a while, but we still call him. They let me ride along for old time's sake. Feels like home in the squad car. --He brought a lot of these parts. He's the one who kept this place from falling to the sodomites. What is that? People up here believe different. Tradition's all just passed down generations. These aren't the same roads that we took to get up here. More than one road in the hills. What you calling at? Ah! Is your body speaking at you? Yeah, i need you to pull over. We're gonna be out in a few minutes. No, I'm gonna be sick. I need you to pull over now. Please? Hey, come back! It ain't safe! Okay, we have to find another way out of here. How? It's pitch black out there. -You have a better idea? -Yeah, we call for help. -No one can get any reception. -We can, we just have to-- we just have to keep trying. You know, cause Sarah's-- Sarah's out there, you know, and she's-- she's waiting for us. -Don't touch me! -Hey, calm down, calm down. Skye! Chewing on those like tic tacs. What is that? Thorazine? How many of these are you taking? How long have you been on this? Since I was eight years old. All right? I've been a fucking schizophrenic since i was eight years old. Sarah? Hey, we're lost. Can you help us? Oh, shit. -What's up, what's up? -There's people out there. What? Who are they? We don't want to find out. What are we gonna do? Okay, think. Think, think, think. Okay, look, we hide in there and we wait them out. -Are you fucking insane? -Am I fucking insane? What, do you wanna hang around and say hi? Is there any other way? May-- maybe we could sidestep them. What if we can't leave this place? What if every path leads us back here? We are gonna leave this place. -They're coming. -Let them bring it the fuck on. All right, you take them and hide the girls, I'm gonna try to avert them, and send for help. Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on. Hey, come on, come on, come on. We gotta find Eric. He doesn't know there are people out there. If he wants to go on his little trip, fine, but this bus is not taking any detours. - You're just gonna leave him? - -Hey! Look, we're gonna get out of this hellhole one way, or another, but I am not searching for him. Come on. Where are we? I don't think this is the way out, Dave. I'm working on it. Eric? Matt? Guys? Guys? Oh, shit. What the hell are you doing? Just give me a minute, Bree. Oh, hell no. Come on. "Murder, rape... Stabbed to death. Buried alive." Jesus Christ. It's almost like someone wanted us to find this. Bree? Where the fuck is she? Shit. Eric? Eric? Eric! -Eric, we gotta go now. -Hey. --You came back. There are people up there. -What people? -I don't know. They were speaking in some weird language. And then I was calling for them for help, but then they just started coming after us and... Whoa, whoa, whoa... Slow down. We had to come down here, they were coming. Eric? This is it. Are you fucking shitting me? -We have to get out of-- -it's fine. This is what i came for. Get it together. That's not real. Matt? What spirits are trapped in here? Come on, I know you can hear me. Just speak to me, okay? Come on, god damn it, talk to us! Those people are coming. This place is some sort of sanctuary, we don't belong here. What the fuck? They're people. They're fucking people. We have to get the fuck out of here, now. Do you hear me? This is a trap, this is exactly what they wanted. I'm outta here. Skye! Skye, come on. Get out. What the fuck? All right. Matt! - Oh, come on, Dave. Jesus Christ. Shit. Ma'am, did you drop something? What the hell is this? You know the plan. They're gone until spring. Captain's gonna have your ass if you're wrong, boy. Say so? See for yourself. She's got the mark. Our prayers have been answered. What she do? She's just a kid. Lord, have mercy. It's what she's going to do. Tell sister to prepare the vessel. Full moon could prove fertile tonight. Sister. Sweet child need love. You get now. This is my work. Captain gonna put on a show tonight. It's all right, girl. Let me help you now. One of you might get lucky too. We're gonna make you a strong mama. Till the moon delivers. The seed's sewn. The circle continue to turn. I've got her. Save yourself. Ugh! --Come here! Kane! Your choice will be right. Sarah! Holy fuck. You okay? Yeah. I been calling your name down the hallway, it's like you're in a trance or something. No, I was watching-- there's some seriously weird fucking shit going on right now. Where's Matt? I don't know. You don't know? No... What's this? I don't-- "mutilated skin. Skinned alive..." Where did you get this? Dave had it. Eric, he's dead. He's what? "Dusty cableton, and Ana Harris found on"-- Ana Harris? That's the name of the grave in the woods. December 5, 1979. She died on the day we were born. What the fuck is going on? --Eric, I'm scared.
