You speak Arabic. Not really. Basically, I can only say "How do you do?" in two ways. - Can I prepare a plate for you? - Yes, please. OK. - Is that fried? - Thanks, that's good. I am so very pleased to welcome you all to the American Colony Hotel. And thank you, Governor Khatib, and my Palestinian friends, and my American-Jewish friends, and my nephew, Eddie. Thank you for being here with me on this very special occasion. And, my special thanks to the Husseini family for bringing, like, every year this magnificent tree! And what is so special about this tree, is that every year we put it back into the ground. This place has always been an oasis for everybody. And I know it is very hard not to talk about politics at this delicate time for our country and for all of us, but at least for tonight, let's put all the problems outside and enjoy each other's company. Merry Christmas! ...we the members of the People's Council, representing the Jews of Israel and the Zionist movement, are here assembled on the day of the end of the British mandate. By virtue of our natural and historic right, and based on the United Nations resolution, we do hereby declare the establishment of a Jewish state in the land of Israel to be known as the state of Israel. Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama. Who are you? Why are you here? We were attacked last night. Bombs, fire. My mother pushed us out the back door. We couldn't see. Too much smoke. We called to each other. Houses on fire. We heard shooting, bombs. Mohammed said he saw tanks and soldiers. We ran and ran. And that's when Abdullah fell. Hamid said soldiers came into his house. Killed his grandfather, father and mother. His sisters, too. We're all from Deir Yassin. Soldiers shoved us in a truck. Lots of smoke. People died. I don't know where my brothers are. Everybody died. What is your name? Zeina. Zeina. Mama! Hello! Hello, Hind. We have to feed them. Mama, don't worry. They'll only stay a few days. Why don't you take them to your grandfather's? - How many do you have? - Nearly 200. And they keep coming. Dir Qassem, Luvia, Shejerah, Ramle... Entire villages are being reduced to rubble. The League of Nation is asking if you could take children that has been left behind. We don't know where their families are. There are so many. They are here already. I sold my properties, most of my mother's. You know we have to do something. We have to get this place bigger. We need building permits, we need maybe to annex the other buildings. We need help. There is going to be a tax. No business occurs, no license can be issued in this city, without donating something for that effort. This I can assure you. Thank you. That's a good name for a school. Children's Home. Maybe their families will find them here. Miss Husseini, good morning. Happy seeing you here. Thank you. I need to talk with Sheikh Saabah. Excuse me. Excuse me, Mrs. Hind Husseini, she's here to see you. Miss Husseini, I knew your father. - Great man. Please. - I'm sorry to interrupt. But I do need five minutes of your time. There's something very important I want to show you. - Nothing takes five minutes... - If that's... Please, what can I do for you? It's very important. With respect, ten minutes. We have children from every corner of Palestine. And every day there is more. Fifty-five became 900. These kids need us and we need them too. Not as hungry and ignorant grown-ups, but as strong, well-educated adults. - Who pays for all this? - I do. You don't get any help from any Arab government? We don't want any government to interfere. We have some money from civilians. My goal is to educate these kids and give them hope. I need you to give them future. Miss Husseini, can I call you Hind? Of course, please meet my mother. Your daughter honors not only the good name of your people, but the whole Arab world. Let Allah be my witness, I will do everything I can to help you. Thank you. This is the military governor and the only authority now for East Jerusalem is Israeli law. These are the orders for the residents of East Jerusalem. From now on there will be a curfew from 7pm to 7am. The only valid documents will be provided by the military near the new Jerusalem gate. Give up all your weapons. Anybody concealing weapons or enemy soldiers will be imprisoned. - Yes? - I'm here to see Hind Husseini. One times one? Excuse me, pardon me for interrupting. I'm Colonel Edward Smith, American Army with the UN. Pleased to meet you, Colonel Smith. Eddie. What can I do for you? I just wanted to say hello. I'm stationed here now. I'm staying at my Aunt's. I can't believe my eyes, it's been such a long time. Yes, too long. Girls! All together and very politely, nice and loud: "Hello, Colonel Smith!" We have kindergartens, elementary school, high school, and those are the dormitories. - How are your brothers? - Two of them are here. I haven't seen Khalid, Amin or Ali since the border closed. What you've done here is incredible. I had a lot of help. But now, with the Israeli military occupation, it's getting difficult. I need documents and permissions to cross checkpoints. I can't get to villages where I need to pick up orphans. Near Bethlehem, Ramallah, Jericho, Nabulus. Let me try to fix that. I always thought it was great the way your family returned the Christmas tree to the ground. We always did. After all, what was the use in celebrating Christmas if we let it die? - You never married? - No. But I have 2,000 daughters. The big ones take care of the small ones, that's my technique. - Hi, Jamal. - Hello, Miss Hind. This baby was left in the doorway to the mosque. Thank you. Eddie, this is Jamal Shahin. One of our imams of Al-Aqsa Mosque. Nice to meet you. It's a pleasure. - Please. - OK. Pleased to meet you. He helped in this garden too. - You did a fine job. - Thank you. Miss Hind. You like Hidiyah as a name? Beautiful. That's a fine name. I want my girls to maintain their Palestinian identity. I want them to know where they came from. And be proud of it. Those cactuses and stones are beautiful. They are. The stones used to be houses. And the cactus were fences to separate homes. This was actually a village. I know you're busy with the school. But don't be a stranger and... uh, write to me? - Keep me informed. - I will. Thank you, Eddie. I will never forget your help. We have to get out of here, come on. I promise, I can find a job, I can take care of us. - What are you doing? - I'm leaving out of here. - What are you talking about? - I'm leaving this shit. You know what I'm talking about. You know what your husband has been doing to me all that time. I didn't know anything, we can figure this out. Figure what out? - Just stop him, because she is next. - Let her go. Let her go. Bitch. - I... beg of you, stay. - Go, bitch, go to hell. Shut up! - Let her go. - You could have protected me. Nadia! Nadia. Take this. Go. Hey, beautiful. Can I buy you a drink? Huh? - I don't drink. - Oh! Your Hebrew's great. Where you from? What are you, stupid? I don't want to talk to you. Get lost. Go sit down or get out. She your woman? Out! Why do you let her dance? You OK? Eat something. I'm not hungry. What are you staring at? A whore. An Arab whore. Sh... It's OK. Thank you. Sh. It's OK. You'll be OK. You rest a few days and then it will pass, OK? How long have you been drinking? What makes you think that? I'm a nurse and you smell like alcohol. I don't know when I started. I know why. My name is Fatima. - What's yours? - Nadia. Where are you from, Nadia? Jaffa. And what are you doing here? Six months for hitting a woman in the nose. Who are you? I told you, my name is Fatima. I'm a nurse. I was a good nurse. The head nurse of the ward. Help me to escape. We were told that all wounded soldiers in the hospital would become prisoners of war. I figured if that boy had come from Jordan to fight for the Palestinian people, the least I could do was help him get home. Follow me. I was fired on the spot. Three life sentences for helping some soldiers escape? No, it wasn't for that. After I was fired, I didn't know where to go or what to do. I did know I wanted them to suffer like we do. East Jerusalem was under military occupation. I felt I had to act. We can't wait for outside help. No one will help us. We must do this ourselves. This war is not over yet. It took more than a month for the bomb to arrive from Lebanon. So I did it. It was easier for me, I'm a woman. - One ticket, please. - It started already. It's OK. I have seen it before. The prisoner will now stand and hear the verdict of the court. Can you understand me? Stand up. Very well. Two consecutive life sentences. And for blatant disrespect of this court, let's add one more. The bomb didn't go off, but I was given two life sentence. And one more for not standing in the court. Three, seven... what is the difference? Am I a terrorist? How can you kill someone you don't even know? Military occupation is a monster that kills your soul. I see them as soldiers. I'm fine. Take care of each other. Take care of yourself. Nadia will soon be out. She insists on going back to Jaffa, but I told her she should go with all of you to Jerusalem. I would like very much if you'd take care of her. Congratulations to the husband and wife! There we go, my sweet. Haven't you had enough to drink today? No. Not enough. Do you have to do it now? I'm going to... Don't wait up for me. Mama. Can I eat your kunafeh? Of course you can. Just brush your teeth. We'll save it for her. She'll want it when she comes back home. Where is Miral? - Miral? - She's not here. - Where is she? - She's not here. Where are you hiding her? I need to take my daughter to school. She's not here. I will get her soon. It is nearly 12. What did you do to her?! I will get her. It is nearly 12. She is at school. Look, look. Please, please, please, please. Please. Don't touch me. I'm dirty. That is not true, that is not true. - You don't deserve this. - Nadia... No, no, come here. You know... you know... ...I have loved you from the very moment I saw you. - No! - No, let me help you. Let me help you. Don't touch me! Where's my daughter? Miral? Miral! What did you do to my daughter? I'm going to kill you! Is that too cold? It's OK. It's OK. Just wash up. We must think about our daughter. How do you want her to grow up? Not like me. This one? This one is alive and happy, this one is sad and tired. No, no. We have some at home. Mama? - Hello, Jamal. - Miss Hind. Miral, how nice to see you. What a beautiful dress. You want to go play with the other girls? Hadil, Leila, come take Miral. It's OK, habibti. Go and meet your new friends. Make sure you look very pretty. Go. After all these years bringing the children here, I... ...I never imagined this. Don't worry about her. She'll be fine. You have to take care of yourself. I love her more than my own life. But I don't want her to end up like my sister. - Or her mother. - Go home. Try to sleep. I'll take care of her. Miral! Miral! - Daddy. - Miral. Miral. Miral. Look at me. Daddy! Listen. Miral, your father will be back Friday. I want my daddy! He will come back Friday. You will go with him every weekend. OK? I want to go home. Look at it this way, Dar El Tifl is your second home. Most of the girls have only one. You will have two. And I promise you, you will see your father every Friday. - Papa! Papa! - Oh! Who is my beautiful girl? You are. Mm! Come, come. I have a delicious surprise for you. Come, come, come. - Miral, you are late. - Sorry. - Hadil. - Girls, be quiet. Girls, girls, listen to me. Miral. Listen to me. This is a very crucial moment for our country. Some of you might have heard that there is an uprising. - What has been called the "intifada". - It means "stand up straight". We have been occupied by the Israelis for many years. Four Palestinian workers from Gaza were run over by a military convoy. And that was the last straw. Our people can't take it anymore. Schools have been closed. Our duty, yours and mine, is to help educate the children. I am going to send you to the refugee camps to reopen their classes. You will be their teachers. - I eat. - I eat. - I ate. - I ate. I will eat. You have 10 minutes to clear this area! This house will be destroyed. You have 10 minutes to clear the area! This house will be destroyed! It's a threat to national security! Get out! Where is this family going to sleep tonight? Why isn't anybody doing anything about it? Well, we should. We should do something about it. Mama Hind. - Sit down. - Soldiers destroyed a house. We live in paradise while our people struggle every day against this shit. "Shit"? What kind of language is this? Excuse me. But I can't just sit here waiting for the next English class. You can and you will. This didn't start today. I understand your anger. But you must control your emotion, your impatience. - There is a peace march... - No marches! I don't want you girls to be doing anything that would put the school in danger. Hadil! Hadil! Hadil! Hadil! Let me see her! Let's go! - Let's go! Let's go! - Hadil! Hadil! No, she's OK. She's frightened, but she's resting. Of course. I'll bring her there myself. OK. OK. Bye. Miral. It's OK. I have to go. I have to go home. Hind Husseini knows you are here, I just spoke with her. - Please, rest. Have some tea... - How do you know my name? It's your school uniform. You're from Dar El Tifl. Don't worry. Rest for a moment. Everything is going to be OK. My cousin's so ugly. He's fat. He stinks. Everything's going to be OK. But I don't want to go to Egypt. And he's never said a word to me. Hadil, Miss Hind is ready to see you. Don't worry. It will be all right. Tell me, Hadil. Do you want to leave the school, marry your cousin and move to Egypt? Of course she does. Look, she's shy. What do you say, Hadil? No, I don't, Mama Hind. I'm sorry. I'm sure you understand. I can't force one of my girls to take such a step against her will. Thank you, Hadil, you can go. Miral, I don't have to marry my ugly cousin! See, I told you! I told you Mama Hind would fix everything. Sit. The first thing I want to say is that I love you. I also loved Hadil. I don't blame you for what happened. But I don't want to lose you too. How do you think I kept this place open? I'm not going to be here forever. All of you will replace me. Any political involvement is not dangerous only for you, but for all of us. Stop this immediately or I will not be able to keep you here. I have to deal with the Israelis every day. You have to think. Prudence is the most precious... You don't understand anything! If you were me, you would be out there too! This is our struggle! Listen, girl! This school is the difference between you and the children in the refugee camp. This is your chance, Miral. Don't lose it. I lost Hadil! Hadil is gone. You are here. Look at me. Miral. Look at me. I'm sorry. No, this is not right. We have to continue to coordinate our efforts with the PLO. We cannot act independently. Without unity, we can achieve nothing. You know, Hani, I agree with you. As I always did. But why do we have to wait for orders from our brothers who left more than 30 years ago? We are running the intifada. The PLO doesn't have a plan for the intifada. They don't have a political leadership for this. This is our identity as revolutionaries. With all my respect, OK, they are on the outside. We have our own leaders who are living here! You make the decision. It's my duty to share every decision with the PLO. This is not a personal choice. It's my responsibility. Our responsibility. I asked a boy once in the camp if he would like to be a teacher when he grew up. He said, "I'd like to grow up first. " We have to change that. I feel useless. Don't you want to do something more? You have beautiful eyes. What is this book you are reading? This one. It's called The Elements Rage. It has some interesting pictures of natural disasters. I'll show you this one here. During a hurricane in Puerto Rico, a ten foot pine board, measuring three-by-one inches, was shot through this royal palm tree. A tornado taken in Jasper, Minnesota in July 8, 1927. - A water spout. - Wow. I like it. I have something for you. A book about a manmade disaster. Abu lyad: Palestinian Without Identity. It will tell you a lot you need to know. These settlers living here, are our real cancer. They occupy our land. They compromise any future solution. They are religious Jews. They think God has told them to live here. Any Jew that wants to live in Israel gets immediate citizenship. They come from everywhere. Russia, the US, and they have more rights than any Palestinian. The main reason why the soldiers are in the occupied territories is to protect them. They put everyone in danger, even the soldiers. A house, a yard, and two soldiers for every settler. They want it all... They want us all to leave. What they really want is all of Palestine... ...and without Palestinians. That is why we must resist. Until they understand there is no future for them without one for us. Wait here, I have to see a friend. I'll be right back, OK? Miral! Listen, I have to take this car. But Ali can give you a ride home, OK? I'm going with you. Fine. But you have to get in the back - like my passenger, OK? - OK. OK. Bye, Ali. This car is a piece ofjunk. - Why are we stopping? - Hang on. I have to take a look. Wait a second. It's dead. Let's go. Here's your bag. Identity cards. What are you doing? That doesn't make a man of you! Shut up. Pick up your stuff. Where are you going? Bethlehem, to study with a friend. You do homework in Bethlehem? We are studying for our final exams. What is this? Just the copies for my classmates. It all looks the same. I can't read Arabic. Can you? No. Just take one. Can I have it back? He asked me if I'm going to Bethlehem, so I thought I could do it. - He asked me questions and he took one. - Miral. I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do? I... - OK, we'll change the information, OK? - No. Miral, now everything has to be changed. - You should have... - What's the big deal? The deal is this is serious. But, Hani, I just wanted to help, OK? That's why. No disrespect. You should have told me. I pick who goes. No disrespect? Go to your school. Stay there. If you have a problem, just remember, you're 17, you're an Israeli citizen and you can't be held for more than 24 hours. In that 24 hours, you say nothing. And you'll be safe. Let's hope they don't have your name. Come. Better I take you. Do you still have copies of that paper? - No. - The books I gave you, where are they? - My father's house. - You have to get rid of them. Where do I put them? What are you doing here? You come home with me. He is not for you. She is not for you. Papa, he's Yasmin's boyfriend. You think your father is stupid?! Papa, I met him by coincidence. I was going back to school... Do not ever look at me in the eye and lie to me. This I will not accept. - Do you understand who he is? - He's a good man. He's a patriot. We cannot talk about this. Go to your room. I have seen this before. Our family was destroyed by this. My sister, they put her into jail for ten years, then afterwards they threw her out of the country. She will never come home again. She will never see her home. I don't want this for you. No violence. You don't understand anything. You don't understand anything because you've been hiding in the mosque your whole life! I'm sorry, Papa. I didn't mean it, Papa, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Papa. Police! Open up! - Can I help you? - Hello. We are here for Miral Shahin. Miral Shahin, does she live here? - She is my daughter. There must be... - Call her, please. - She's asleep. It's very late. - Sit down. - Sit down. - I don't understand. I am Miral Shahin. - See, she's all ready. - Don't worry, Papa. I'll be back soon. Miral! There is some misunderstanding. Please, you cannot take her. She is a school child! She is innocent, she knows nothing! I will answer your questions. She is not a criminal. Help! I will answer them! Papa! Papa... Look at that picture again. Where is he? - I told you, I don't know him. - Really? Because I think this girl back here, behind your friend Hani, is you. That's not me. Your name is on the list. We have it. You belong to an enemy organization. It is a mistake. I don't know what you're talking about. You have a beautiful face. Do you know what it means to stay in jail for a while? You won't recognize yourself when you walk out of here. Do you want to save yourself? Go back to school? Tell me where Hani is and you can go. I have to go to the bathroom. You're not going anywhere before you answer me. Please, I have to go now. Please. If you have to go, go. Finished? You're not being very helpful. After everything your father did for you, why do you want to help them? Don't mention my father. If you have to beat me, do it. Why are we here? - Miral Shahin. - Yes, no? Your Honor, she's suspected of belonging to an enemy organization. What evidence does he have of this, Your Honor? Do you have an answer for that? We have what we believe to be a photo of her. It's in the file, Your Honor. Go sit down. - Did she sign or admit anything? - No, Your Honor. Your Honor, my client has a clean record. This is her first offense. There's no evidence against her. Not yet. We need another Your Honor, she's 17. She's an Israeli citizen. And she's been here for 24 hours. You can put your shirt down. You will pay a fine of 3,000 shekels. I don't want to see you here again. You're free to go. I didn't tell them anything. They asked you about other people? Hani. Did you tell them anything about him? I said I didn't know him. So why did they let you go? They had to. I was imprisoned for 24 hours. My father had to pay 3,000 shekels. - Why don't you believe me? - Why? 'Cause yesterday 100 people arrested, that's why. I didn't admit anything. If anybody contacts you again, just speak to Yasmin. OK? Get out. Hello? Are you feeling better? Yes, she is here. She's fine. Please, take care of yourself. Yes, yes. Just a minute. Miral? Habibti, Papa is on the phone. Thank you. Hello, Papa. Are you OK? It's getting better. What about you? Oh, I'm sorry. I can see the sea, Papa. It's so beautiful. I love you, too. I miss you. Bye. Cousin, you've been in this bed two weeks. Cousin, you need to go out. I will take you with me to a party. See that pretty one over there? She's my girlfriend. - Come on, let's dance. - It's OK. I'll sit here for now. - Come on. - Come on? - She is Jewish. - Yeah, so? - Does your mom know? - Yeah, she knows. - Miral, come on, let's dance. - No. You go dance with your friends. I don't like dancing. Want to go swimming with me? No. I don't have a bathing suit. Neither do I. Miral, come on. I don't feel like it. OK. I sit here with you. You can do what you want. I'm Lisa. Samir's girlfriend. I know. Are you in the army? No. Luckily, I have asthma, so they let me out. Lisa. Hm? Are you serious about Samir or are you just playing with him? You want me to come back and start over? I mean, what did I ever do to you? Huh? I love him. Have you ever loved anybody before? Why do you dress like that? Lisa is gonna be here soon. I want her to feel uncomfortable and to leave him. - She seems sweet. - What are you saying? I was counting on you. I thought you are the liberation front. Wow. It smells great in here. My Auntie's a great cook. She's been cooking all day for you. What are you making? She does not speak Arabic. You translate for her! OK, it is stuffed potatoes and stuffed zucchini. And that is... ...upside down. And it's one of the very rare recordings of Pete Townshend alone, unaccompanied, by himself, on his guitar. I love this one. You know Pete Townshend? He's the guitar player of The Who. What's "The Who"? It's a band. You know, like The Rolling Stones. "The Rolling Stones"? Never mind. What does your family think about you and Samir? My Aunt Ruth spit in my face. Said I was going to bed with the enemy. How can you love an Arab man then? How can I not? He's great. Smart. Sweet. And he loves me. And he kisses like an angel. How does an angel kiss? What are you doing? Hello. Abba, this is Miral. - Hi. Hi, Miral, how are you? - Good. - Where are you from? - Jerusalem. Miral, what kind of a name is that? It's the name of a red flower, it grows on the side of the road. You've probably seen millions of them. It's a Persian name, but I'm Palestinian. You mean Israeli. No. I mean Palestinian. - She's Samir's cousin. - Well, I need to talk with you. But I have a friend here. Huh? OK. I'll talk with you later. Bye bye, Miral. I'm so sorry. He thinks that all Palestinians are terrorists. I have to go. I have to get back. OK, I drive you. Huh? Where are you going, girls? Jerusalem. OK, go. This is good. Stop here. I live close by. Maybe next time you can meet my father. Thank you. Bye. Miral, wait. Have you seen Hani? You don't know? He's a traitor. - Be careful, he gave names. - That is ridiculous. If people see you with him, they will suspect you too. Come on, Yasmin. You know him. I don't believe this. You watch yourself. You're freed in less than 24 hours. People know about you too. You hear from him, let us know. My angel. I'm glad you're home. I am. I got you some kunafeh. Oh! - And it's warm. - I know, it's fresh. I'm going to stay here now and take care of you like you took care of me. I am so sorry for upsetting you, Papa. Seeing you does my heart good. Papa, thank you for taking me to Hind. For protecting and loving me. I am so proud to be your daughter. I love you, Papa. I love you too. Let's not stay here, come on. I missed you. I missed you so much. I missed you too. You look so beautiful. - I look terrible. - No. They warned me about you. Told me you were a traitor and you gave names to the Israelis. But I didn't believe them. No. They're trying to discredit me because I changed my position about the negotiations. It is not only me, many have changed. And there's a real fracture inside the PLO because of it. I didn't give anybody any names. - I know. - The Israelis are looking for me. I didn't believe them anyway. They're meeting every day. Both here, in Jerusalem, and in Oslo talking about the partition. I really believe this time it could work. How can you say that? Miral, this road is too bloody. It has no exit. We'll accept 22 percent of the land. It's more than what we have now. We can't go on fighting forever. Twenty-two percent? Why can't it be one country for everybody? Where we all have the same rights. You know, real democracy, like in New York City. It's too soon for that. We should have two states. An Israeli and a Palestinian one. And the truth is our allies are not the Arab regimes or the United Nations, but the Israelis themselves. They're not going anywhere and neither are we. But two states, one state, I don't care. I want to live. I want a future for our children. What are we going to do now? I have to hide for awhile. But there are bigger problems than mine. How's your father? He's very sick. I'm sorry, habibti. Do you know what HLA is? Yes, it is the specific type of genetic matching you need to avoid graph-versus-host disease after a bone marrow transplant. You are very well informed. I must admit that, for not being a blood relative your HLA is quite close to the blood of Jamal Shahin. What do you mean? He's my father. I know he is, but he's not your biological father. Your DNAs don't match. I'm sorry. I thought you knew. Why didn't you tell me, Papa? Because... ...it didn't matter. I raised you. If you want to meet your real father... ...your Aunt Tamam, she will help you. You are my real father. Come here. Of course I am. You have always been my daughter. Stop... worrying about this. Allah be with his soul. He was a good man. He lent this to me. I return it to you. Miral. I'm sorry about your father. - Have you seen Hani? - I think you should see this. Apparently, negotiations are going right now at the American Colony Hotel. You didn't believe he was a traitor, did you? Not for a second. - Where do you think you are going? - I'm an interpreter. She's fine, she's OK. - She's been working here. - Sorry. I don't know. - You're OK. Let her in. - Thank you. Big rumors of an imminent agreement between them and us. Can you imagine, a free Palestinian state? I'll believe it when I see it. - I've got to go back to work. - Yeah. - Could I have a coffee, please? - I don't work here. Oh, I apologize, I saw you speaking to the receptionist and I... just jumped to the wrong conclusion. - No, it's OK. - You're so young. - Are you a journalist too? - No, I'd like to be one. Well done, you're doing your research on your own, you're on the right track. Come, have a coffee with me. I am Samar Hilal, I write for Greece. - Nice to meet you. - They are in room 16 right now. They've been locked in that room for hours. Let me give you a tip. If you want to be a journalist, you need to get your hands dirty. Sitting around in hotels and drinking coffee, that's not gonna get you anywhere. - I'll see you at the front lines. - Thank you. Come. Mama Hind, I think we are nearing our final agreement. They will sign something in Oslo, probably in a few months. There is already an agreement between both sides. And we are going to have a country. We are free. Israel agreed to give back There are still certain things left on the table, but there's refugees, settlements, specifics about Jerusalem and water. Only sure thing is that West Bank and Gaza will be on the Palestinian state. And the PLO can come back. And we will govern ourselves. I didn't think I would see this in my lifetime. Miral... ...I know Hani is dead. I know you were very close to him. This transition is not going to be easy. I want you to leave. You need to think about your future, your education. I got you a scholarship in Italy. Go. Make your own destiny. And make the most of it. Thank you for everything, Mama Hind. Thank you. I love you, Miral. I love you too. You are my hope. You are my blessing. Look. They're all gone. It's summer, they'll be back. - Let's go. - Yeah. - Where to? - Airport.
