Bonnie, get your burger. Hey, dude. You got it. Jamie, Jamie, where's the baby? Um, Peggy -- Peggy took her. Go check. See, her car's gone. I saw her leave 10 minutes ago. The baby's out front.

I said, um, "Where'd you get the steaks from?" "Hey, come on, man, just buy the steaks. I have kids to feed." I look at him for a minute. I'm looking around. He got to be jerking my chain. I said, "Well, feed 'em steak!" Hey. Let's button this up. I want you to relax. It's gonna be okay, all right? Just take a deep breath. You have a full clip. It's cocked and ready to go.

You don't like the color? Okay, we'll take it. What's the first thing that you do? What's the first thing you do? Right. You don't want cops messing with you because of a little thing like that. Okay. Roll forward 10 feet. You know what you did wrong? Yes, sir. All right. Okay! Put the car in drive and roll forward 10 feet! Good. Stop. Reverse. Left turn -- hard left. Keep it left. Hit the gas. Keep it left. The primary mission of a sniper in combat is to support combat operations by delivering precise long-range fire on selected targets. By this, the sniper creates casualties among enemy troops, slows enemy movement, frightens enemy soldiers, lowers morale, and adds confusion to their operations. A well-trained sniper, combined with the inherent accuracy of his rifle and ammunition, is a versatile supporting arm available to the infantry commander. The sniper must be able to calmly and deliberately kill targets that may not pose an immediate threat to him. It is much easier to kill in self-defense or in the defense of others than to kill without apparent reason. A sniper must not be susceptible to emotions such as anxiety or remorse. Oh, shit. So, you're the guy. Well, I pictured you a little different, but it's cool. Yeah, yeah, man, it's cool, you know? I don't give a shit. So, you boys ain't from around here, huh? That's cool.

I mean, they're a little old, but a mine's a mine, right? Come on, man, w-what's going on? Look, what the fuck you doing, man? We can't use land mines. All right, look, I-I'm down for your fucking cause, you know, your black panther shit. All right, you want to blow some shit up, blow some shit up. I don't give a fucking shit, all right? Please get out of the car. Shit. And remember, my dad has your address and your telephone number. I've created a monster. Go back up! You've got to brake quick. If you're gonna get that much speed, you got to get off the gas and brake quicker. Let's go! Brake! Get up to speed. Come as close as you can, spin. Brake! Get in there, now! Go back up! One more time! Yeah. Hey, dude. How long are they staying? He's my friend, babe. Says who? What the fuck do you know? What do you know? "Frightens enemy soldiers, lowers morale." He's a good kid. He isn't ours. He isn't even his. They got nothing to do with us. What are you doing, dude? I'm just thinking. "Realization of the sniper's presence instills fear in enemy troops." Okay. "Influences their decisions and actions." "The sniper's role is unique in that it is the sole role - that becomes more significant" - That's for me! "when the target is entrenched or positioned among civilians." Yes, hello. This is Principal Winters here at John F. Kennedy High School in Camden, New Jersey. We have three sets of records for some students of yours -- two brothers and a sister. Looks like they were transferring schools, and their paperwork got sent to us by mistake. Yeah, well, you know how it is. If you could tell me where those records should have gone, I can send them out today. No harm, no foul. Maryland, huh? Oh, that's a long way off. Oh, no, don't you worry. I'll take care of it. Easy as pie. What an awful car. That's them. Still up. Always hated bedtime. She liked to let them tire themselves out, so As if she knew better than me. I'd have to chase them around and pick them up one by one. "Come on, babies. Time to sleep. Time to sleep." Well it's not about them anymore. Let's go. And a very good Friday morning to you all. It's 6:47 now. It's time for your local weather on the 7s. We have a high-pressure system moving through All right, do you have everything filled out for me? The search continues for the man or men responsible for the seemingly random shootings across the D.C. area. Authorities now suggest that the killers may be traveling in a white van or truck, putting suburban Washington on alert. The death toll now stands at five confirmed. - Here you go. - Oh, thank you. Other incidents also possibly related. Oh, sorry. It's all right. 911. What is your emergency? I think someone's been hurt in our parking lot. There's a woman there standing by, and someone else is running over. Ma'am, where is the person now? She's in the parking lot. It looks like the girl just went and shot herself. She killed herself sitting on the bench here. What's going on there? I think this guy's lawn mower fell on him or something, man. It's like it sliced him up, maybe. I don't know. He's bleeding real bad. He's a mess. Ma'am, I need you to stay inside your vehicle. 911. What's your emergency? Um, we have a lady shot in our parking lot. I'm at the gas station on Aspen Hill, and a man just fell. - Is he bleeding? - He's laying there. Get away from the This woman was just bleeding when I got there There had been a gunshot. They think all this is permanent. They don't realize the house of cards they're living in. All it will take is a little push. A few bodies. Well more than a few bodies. Maybe five. 6 a day for 30 days. Really get their attention. Random targets. Well, not random targets. We want to keep them scared. We want them to stay scared. It has to get worse. When they think it's men, kill a woman. But when they think it's women, kill a kid. And when they think it's kids, kill a pregnant woman, a Grandma, a cop. At the cop's funeral plant a bomb. Lots of bombs. Blow up a whole bus full of cops. They'd have to call in the National Guard then. Total chaos. The system comes down. Oh god! Oh, my god! Ma'am! Listen to me. What is wrong? A man has been killed in front of me! Oh, god! Ma'am, calm down. How did he die, ma'am? I don't know! I don't know. We'll pick a spot in the woods, up into Canada, start a training camp. We'll find other kids like you and teach them, send them to other cities to do what we did. Philadelphia Saint Louis Atlanta Detroit New York Until there's hysteria everywhere. The beauty is even if we lose, we still wake people up. We still win. We still win. Watch your head. All clear. Got one. Clear. Lost him. Guy with the beige suit? The satchel? Got him. Ready? Go. Go. Hey. Your watch. Oh, my goodness. Morning. Oh, morning. Anyone else in the vehicle with you? Oh, it's my son. Uh, I just picked him up from camp late last night. There's no overnight parking in the rest area. Did you see the signs? No. No, I didn't, sir. No, it was dark when we got here. Oh. I'll let you go with a warning this time. I see you here again, I'll write you a ticket. Oh, absolutely, absolutely. Thank you, sir. Thank you. I appreciate that. Dispatch, about that 1038, I think I've got something here. Copy that. Stay where you are. Aspen Hill city police. This line is recorded. Good morning. Don't say anything, just listen. We're the people that are causing the killings in your area. We've called you three times before to set up negotiations. We got no response. People have died. Is that your voice? 'Cause it, um, doesn't sound like your voice. Did he tell you to say those things? Can I ask you that? Okay, let's talk about your victims then, hmm? The people that you killed. How do you feel about them? So, what about this one, hmm? He was, um I think he was pumping gas, right? Just pumping gas with his back to you. It was more of a diagonal. Sideways. Sideways? Like this. You know? Twisted his body. Couldn't get a body shot. You couldn't get a body shot, so you shot him in the head? You must be a pretty good shot. Decent. Now, everybody's saying -- the media -- they're saying that these killings are senseless, that they're meaningless. But there's got to be a meaning. There's got to be a reason. Was it for money? Was it for revenge? Was it some kind of belief? If you're not gonna answer me, how are leading me? Since you're asking me so many questions Can I ask you a question now? Sure. Ask me anything you want. Where's my father? Open two cell. Come on out.
