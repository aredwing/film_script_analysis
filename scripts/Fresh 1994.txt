Always with you young boys, always in a rush, always in a rush. Marisol already leave for school. She has not missed one day of school in three year. Sit down, sit down. You like some milk? Some milk and cookie? I have some nice chocolate chip. You like Marisol? Marisol, she always asking about you: "Why Michael come here? Why he don't talk to me at the school? " You have a girlfriend? Ahhh, you already liking somebody. But I don't worry. You are young. Is plenty of time. Soon you get tired of her, and then you talk to my Marisol. And I'm always telling her, "You wait for that Michael. "He's gonna go far, to a very far place. So take your time. It's okay." Because I always tell her a word about how you a boy very special-- - Half a brick means 20. - Yes, yes, of course, 20. - It ain't 20. - Yes, yes, of course, 20. Esteban said I gotta take this to Chillie's store. I gotta take 20. If I don't give him 20, he gonna get mad. You want me to count 'em? No, no, no, no. Wait, wait. I-I-I check for you. I-I check again. Oh, look, look. This one was stuck in back here. I don't understand. It's my eyes, you know? So old, not seeing so good no more. And that's why I buy Marisol her glasses right away. So she don't have no trouble with her eyes like me. But Marisol is a pretty girl. Just think about my Marisol... because I want her to have a clever boy like you, so you think about it. I gotta pick up five bricks. Yeah, yeah, they already called. Then why they ain't ready yet? Relax. It's 8:00 in the morning. We ain't hardly woke up yet. It's almost 8:45. I'm late for school. Oh, for joy! It's little Fresh, our messenger to the gods. My tag is for my friends. You can call me Michael. You know, it's embarrassing... Esteban using this ugly little maricon for man's work. It makes me sick. What's embarrassing is, all the work there is to do... Esteban got you workin' up here with the bitches, that's what's embarrassing. Damn! Ugly spotted little motherfucker. I'll fuck you up. I'm all over these bitches, nigger. Got me a harem here like Arabian motherfuckin' shit. You ain't all over me, motherfucker. You be dead before you touch this good thing, fucking monkey. You tripping on your own shit, motherfucker. Only harem you playin' is them five fingers on your own fuckin' hand. - That's right. - I need five bricks. Five. Everybody know the only reason he here... is 'cause Esteban skied on his freakin' sister. Don't be talkin' about my sister. Word, Esteban clockin' out on that chocolate freak. He doggin' her every chance he get... and she ain't nothing but a hop-head freak riding the white horse-- Say one more word about my sister, bitch. You know, maricon, I 'm gonna fuck you right up. Do it. Come on, bitch. Fuck me up. You know you ain't fuckin' nobody up, Herbie... so shut the fuck up. I need five bricks. Five. Chillie, man, they're all there. I already counted 'em. You know I got to count 'em. You don't get paid 'til they're all counted and accounted for. What, you got ants in your pants? Chill, homes. Esteban wants to talk to you anyway. I gotta get to school, Chillie. I'm stupid late. It's gonna be my second late day this week. Man, Miss Coleman's gonna kill me. Don't worry. I'll write you a doctor's note. Yo, it ain't funny, man. Esteban comin' here just to talk to me? He's making the rounds. But he said he wants you to wait for him 'til he gets here, okay? Kick it, Chillie. Pay me later. I'm crazy late. Tell him I had to get to school. Yo, yo, Fresh. Come back here, crimey. Here. Here, homes. If theres anything missing, I'll kill you later. Well? Did you bring a late pass or didnt you? Boy, who's talking to you, me or that floor? Is this a comedy act, Chuckie? You find this funny? Then shut up and wipe that stupid-looking thing... which you probably think is some kind of charming expression... right off your face, boy. Put your things away and find a seat. Go on! This is not over, do you hear me? Now, what I was saying before that interruption... was that Mr. Hill told you what the words "manifest destiny means... but not what it was. So don't come into my classroom with that ignorant nonsense... about the heroes of the Alamo and Davy Crockett... and how bad they were... because all they were really doing... was robbing another people of their land... so that they could keep opening up new territories for legal slavery. The papers that I gave you have a series of quotes... from some antislavery writers of that time period. You read the first quote, Rosie. It's from an antislavery writer by the name of David Child... written to the Mexican government... warning them about his own United States government. Read it to the class. "Dear Sirs, There is an impatient and almost ir-- "irresistible desire in the South and Southwest... to lay hold on Texas--" Excuse me. Where do you think you are, the land of Oz? You must be trippin'if you two think you're gonna sit together. Boy, move over there. Go on, Rosie. All right, Curtis, you're hogging the ball again. Pass it. Power! Power! That's it. Yo, that shit's mine. Not with a prayer, nigger. That's it. - That shit's mine This is mine. - Look, look, nigger. - Yeah, that's mine. That's right. - Shit. Step right up, step right up. One more, my good man. One more. Only if you flip Willie Randolph. - Uh-uh. Sorry, G. - Yo, forget it, then. Yo, I gave my last Willie Randolph double to Fresh in class, man. - I only got one left. - Flip Willie Randolph! No! N-O spells no. No one never flips him. And it be costing me six bucks of packs 'til I get him. You a chump buyin' them shits, man. I ain't never bought me no baseball card. - Been stealin' them shits all day. - Stealin' them shits all day. Yo, shut up, Tarleak. You ain't never stole shit, so shut up! - Yes, I did. - Why you ain't got nothin'? Show me your cards. I ain't bring 'em with me. Niggers be always jumpin' me for my baseball cards. - Yo, shut up, retard. - My old man got every series of baseball cards since 1900. He got Willie Mays, Jackie Robinson, all of them. They didn't even have baseball cards back then, stupid. - Uh-huh, I seen 'em. - Yeah, where? At my old man 's. He got all them cards where he at. Where he be keepin ' 'em at? In his, like, how many limos? Six. Nigger got six limos. Word, six of'em. Stupid big limos. You haven't even met your father, motherfucker. - I did! - You haven't even seen the motherfucker... so shut the fuck up before I kick your bucktooth, nappy-head ass! - Look at this. - He be lookin' at her like this. - Shut up, nigger. - I don't be likin' them bitches. Always be trippin'. Walkin' with their nose up, like they all that. Word, always hittin' me and shit. - Like that girl Shanice. She don't stop 'til I smack her. - Word, right. They be hittin'you 'til you smack 'em. Then they cry, but they like that shit. Word, they think they all that, but they just want you to smack they head. Oh. Where you goin ', man? Watchin 'girls. - That's cold, man. - Leavin' his best friend for a girl, man. Yo, Rosie, stop looking at me, all right? Why you always lookin' at me? - 'Cause you look at me so much, I can't help it. - I don't look at you. - You do. You're always lookin' at me. - You trippin'. You drag all your friends into our cheerleading practice like it's all their idea... but you bring 'em so you can look at me. - You stupid trippin'. - It's all right. I think it's cute. Girls always be sayin', "Mikey got them spotty white spots on him." But I think it's cute, I do. I think it's real cute. - Damn, you be lookin' almost white yourself. - I am. - Damn, why you buggin' out? - My mother is white. - Get outta here. - She is. Straight up white. Why she never come to school, then? She don't want you 'cause youre black, right? - Why dont you live with your mother? - I do. You live with your aunt, with Hilary and Jewel and all them others... - so you can stop fronting any time now. - Shut up. My mother's married to a millionaire. Word, she live with Tarleak's old man, with all them limos and shit. She lives in Scarsdale. She's got a big house. Near as big as this whole school. You gotta go through a gate and drive through a whole forest just to get to it. - What kind of car she drive? - A sports car. - What kind of sports car? - I don't know. A Jaguar. If I had me a million dollars, I'd get me a Porsche 959. I'd get me a sports car. A Jaguar. Damn, I'd get me a Ferrari Testarosa, V-1 2 engine... get me a Porsche 930, straight six turbo engine... get me a Vector B-1 2, twin turbo... go from zero to 60 in 7.8 seconds, so don't even talk. Yeah, well, who cares, 'cause you ain't never gonna have a million dollars anyway. - I will too! - Who's trippin' now? Ain't nobody trippin'. I'm gonna have it. Someday, I'm gonna have it. Hi, Grandma. Yo, what up? Why is everybody out here? We just here. What a place to spend our last night on earth... What up, y'all? Hey. Where Aunt Francis at? She home. Yo, why everybody around here illin'? Yo, I got winners. Michael? You're home. Look, Nichole. Your brother's here. Hey, Nicky. I know Michael wants you to come back and stay with us for a while. Look, Aunt Francis, I just came to get a few of my things. I'm not staying. Michael, you want Nicky to stay with us, dont you? Cant sleep here no more. There's like a thousand little girls running in and out of here. Like my feet are hanging off the edge of the bed already. I know it. I know it's crowded in here. And you being a grown woman and all. Nicky, take my bed. Doesn't matter to me. I can sleep in here with the girls for a while. Aunt Francis, I don't want your bed. Well... I guess I'll leave you alone with your brother for a while. Maybe he can talk to you about staying with us a little longer. Michael ain't no one to talk to nobody about nothin'. I gotta go. - Michael? - What? Why you come home so late? You know Aunt Francis be gettin' worried when you come home so late. It's hard enough on her without you be worryin' her all the time. If she gets too fed up and gives all of us up, I'm gonna kill you. 'Cause ain't none of us can go back to our parents... and I ain't goin' back to no group home, you hear me? You my cousin and all, we all cousins here... but if you ruin it for the rest of us, I'm gonna kill you. - What up, G? - I got ten bucks. - Get you two bottle, homes. - It's good stuff, right? You tried all the rest; now try the best. Are you sure? I mean, you know it for a fact, right? Bust it, you don't like it, you come back. Jake give you back your ten dollars, send you on your way. Just don't be comin' back here again, understand what I'm sayin'? No way five dollars, man. Last time I bought from Jake, I was illin'. That stuff be stupid cut, man. Jake should throw me a freebie, and just on principle. Yo, Consuelo, this is the dope. Live kickin' jumbo crack. You don't like it... bum rush Stringbean or Howard or Lenny. Then you be ill on that stupid baking soda, word. What you got for me there, little buddy? What's the deal? Five dollars a pop. Tell you what. I'll throw you 20 bucks for five. What do ya say, homes? Five times five is 25. Five dollars a pop, man. Look, maybe I better talk to Jake myself, you know? You know you don't be talkin' to Jake. You know that. Look, you tell Jake that I'll suck his dick good, okay? You tell him I'll suck him off real nice. Damn, you know Jake down with them fine bitches. Why he want that from you? All right, listen, how about you and me, baby? We get in that car, I'll suck your sweet little dick for ten bucks. Get out of my face, bitch. Okay, how about I let you fuck me? Okay?

And you said you gonna be with me, right? Come on, man. You're makin'me look bad, man. Let me tell you somethin'. That nigger, Kermit, he is skied. You hear me? That motherfucker is gone. - You stand here waitin', you trippin' worse than he is. - Um,Jake, I gotta-- - Nigger owe me $50. - That's what I'm talking about. - That's twice his money he ain't showin', G. - Yeah, he owe me $50. - Yo, I hear you, man. Come on. - Word up. Look, man, look, look. Motherfucker still ain't comin', man. Oh, you don't think so? Let me tell you somethin'. Nigger don't show up with my money, I'm gonna dead him. - I'm your boy, man, why you beefin' with me? - Yeah, okay. I'm gonna grease that motherfucker like Sunday bacon! I'm gonna cold drop that motherfucker! I'm gonna drop him, man! I'm gonna cold drop him! Now you know better than to always be in my face with this silly ass nonsense. I wouldn't if Jake paid me. But he like always gettin' mad about somethin'. And you know I ain't gonna be gettin' all up in his face when he like that. - So instead, you get in mine. - 'Cause you ain't like that. My man Fresh. My stand-up little G. You see, homes, this-- Hey, what the fuck you doin'? I was pickin' up. Don't be doin' shit behind my back! Why the fuck you gonna be doin' that? Corky, it was my turn. Man, we just playin'. It's just me, baby. I don't give a fuck who you is! Be my mother, motherfucker, I don't play that shit! -Sorry, all right? - Yeah, you be sorry. You do that shit, just do it in front of my face. Now, am I free to finish my little transaction here... without every nigger be doin' some shit behind my back? Niggers be dissin' you at every turn, homes. It's all right, 'cause you my stand-up little G. Yeah. And, uh, I'll be talkin' to Jake about his temper too. It's one hundred dollars. Niggers be gettin' $50 for lookout. I be runnin' that rock all day. One hundred dollars. You one bad motherfucker, crimey. Only reason you ain't the man is you still too goddamn little. But you get bigger, you gonna be the man. Oh, man! I shake on a game, Fishcake. That wasn't no game. All right. Who's next, who's next? Come on. I heard there was players in this shit hole. All I see is chumps. Come on. Who's gonna give me a game? Come on. Get outta here. I ain't got time for this shit. All right. Play. Check. Mate in four. Fuck you. Ain't no mate in no four. Fuck you. Would've been four if you were smart. Mate. Shit. That shit over there was a waste of time. Fished me a twenty, Dad. You don't be pulling 'em in for no twenties. Said it was a waste of time. Time ain't money... no matter what those morons who eat that kind of shit up may try and tell you. Anything lost can be found again, except for time wasted. - It was fun, Dad, stupid fun. You seen that nigger-- - Chess ain't fun, boy. How many times I gotta tell you that? Dont you listen to a word I say? - Maybe if I seen you more. - Well, you don't, so youd be well served... to retain some of the knowledge I'm impartin' to you... rather than giving me all your hard-ass street-attitude bullshit. Ain't so much fun now, is it? Gettin' to be less and less fun every second here. Uh-uh, think about it. Forget the clock for a second, Michael. What kind of player am I? Am I an offensive man or a defensive man? That's right; I'm neither. I play my opponent. If he likes to attack, I force him to defend himself. If hes a cautious man, I draw him into dangerous waters. See, you get so frustrated playing defensive positions... you make stupid moves you'd never make if you were thinkin'. When you come here, boy, check that shit at the door. That's good. That's better. I'm still gonna kick your ass, but that's better. You been playin' on the team? No, huh? Just watchin' the world pass you by. Figure as long as you ain't drownin', everything's all right. I don't need no punk school team. Mate. And he got Hulk number one and all them Thors. My old man got all them comic books. He showed 'em to me, and they were like all stupid number ones. - Yo, he got Superman number one? - Yeah, he got that. He got Action Comics number one? Word, he got that too. He got all them number ones. Where he be keepin' 'em at? In his garage with all them limos? - You know you ain't got no old man. - I do so. Then we'll call him up when we get to my house. We be givin' the nigger a call. - He don't answer no phones. - And why not? He don't want no po' niggers wastin' his time. Bam, Spiderman goes down. Bam, Daredevil goes down. All them niggers is goin' down. Punisher be takin' they ass out. - X-Men take out the Punisher. - X-Man baby stuff, homes. All their costumes and powers ain't shit. Punisher the real dope, homie. Word, I seen a seven-foot-tall White Terminator nigger... with 20 guns on my roof just the other day. Punisher be takin' out all your stupid heroes. He be sayin', Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Take out that nigger! Bam!Bam!Bam!Bam! Bam!Bam!Bam!Bam! Yo, Fresh, I been training him. Watch this. Good boy, Roscoe. Good boy. Good boy? That dog ain't nothin' but badness. Ain't nothin' but badness. What up, Roscoe? You miss me? You miss your homie? Okay, okay, Mama, I'll be in in a minute, all right? I'm gonna fight him on Sunday. - You gonna do what? - Roscoe's gonna take on Ricardo's pit. Roscoe ain't fightin' nobody's nothin'. My dog fight when I say he fight. He ain't your dog. He's our dog; I found him. Ain't nobody askin' you, homes. I'm gonna get paid, bust it. You already gettin' stupid paid, workin' them jobs for Esteban and shit. Yo, we see y'all later. We gotta go. Well, I ain't gotta go. You always be lookin' all ratty and shit... but everybody know you gettin' paid. Yo, why you always be lookin' nappy like that? What you be doin' with all that jack? You be hidin' that shit away, right? Damn, when I get paid, I'm gonna get me those dope new Nikes, like ten pairs. And I'm gonna get me some stupid gold, homes, crazy gold. Like this tooth right here and a five-finger gold ring... - with my tag bustin' all out that motherfucker. - You ain't got no tag. - I will when I get paid. - He ain't fightin'. Then you gonna take me to get a job for Esteban? Yo, man, why not? 'Cause you be actin' like a stupid little kid, that's why not. Yo, why you dissin' me, man? I'm crazy, homie. I'll bust those dope moves. Come on, Rudy. Get it in your mouth. Don't be such a spaz. - Don't be talkin' like that to your son, Esteban. - Hey, chill, woman. He knows I'm only messin' with him. Right, baby? You know Daddy's messin' with you. Sure you don't want no eats? My grandma be cookin' at home. You're a good boy, Fresh. You be eating at home. And you be running to school when I want to talk to you. That's okay, little homie. I like me a smart G. I really do. You seem to have enough time on your hands... to be runnin' those rocks for Corky's boys, though. What, you think I got no eyes but these two in my own head? I know where you be at. Corky got that work. I be runnin' for you once a week, maybe twice if somebody else gets sick. Corky got them jobs. Hey, let me tell you something, Fresh. Now, you're a smart kid, so you hear these words of wisdom. You know, that rock is a bad move. You start messin' with that shit-- sellin', dealin'-- I guarantee inside three, five years, you'll be dead. Or youll have a bullet in your head. Or that pipe in your mouth. Either way, you're dead. Smack is the way to go. This is a gentleman's operation. The clientele is stable, peace-loving. The competition is unconfrontational. And the heat, they mostly let it slide... 'cause there's little hassle all the way around. You find your niche, you stay there, you stay cool... and you be the man into your 50's and 60's. And then you retire your old ass to a nice condo someplace hot... with a lot of nice Jewish people. Leave the business for your kids. Hey, it's like banking, only it's more secure. And you don't pay no taxes. Hey, what are you doing? You ain't holding her right. Come here, come here. I'm trying to feed her, in case you haven't noticed. No, you ain't holding her right. She ain't hungry. Hey, come on. I'm gonna put her to bed. You know, I ain't never sold no rock, and no kind of coke whatsoever. I never even tried it. Don't come near that shit, not even from curiosity. Close the door, okay? It got loose on my last run. I didn't want to give it to no one but you. Hey, my little money man. Hey, you just lost Chillie a hundred bucks on a bet, G... 'cause he don't know you like I do. Hey, you my solid little man. Most niggers, they be givin' their bitches rocks, you know? Watchin' them pop off. Bang! They got they self a Action Jackson bitch. Jumpin' around like a rabbit. Divin' for that dick... Like it's gold at the end of the rainbow, you know what I mean? Hey, not me, little homie. No, no, no, no, not me. No, I love me a straight bitch. Maybe she like to slide into the land of "H"... every once in a while, a regular bitch. Maybe she fine, like a-- Aycarajo, like your sister. Hey, your sister, she fine. And then she take her hit... and, like, her eyes they roll back... and she get suddenly soft. Oh, so soft and pure. And I am holding my very own virgin. My Madonna. Hey, I take that. You know I take that. Is your sister a freak? Hey, come here. Hey, sit down. Now, I'm askin' you a question. Is she a freak? Man, you married. Hey, I know you're just a kid, Fresh, even though you're smart. So I let you talk to me like that just this one time. But you tell me-- You better tell me who she's runnin' with. - Nobody. - Don't fuck with me, little homie! Serious, my aunt won't let her out with nobody. You know, I find that hard to believe. Bitch as fine as that. She always has somebody. Word, but my aunt won't let her out with nobody. I hope you're right, little homie. I hope youre right. Okay, come on. Let's go. I gotta see Nichole. Yeah? Who the fuck are you? Her brother. I gotta see her. I got a kid down here say he Nichole's brother. - Send him up. - One flight up. Use the stairway at the back of the store. There's only one door. So, you Michael. I guess you used up all the ugly in the family. Keep hearin' you the little man runnin' the street. You the little man runnin' the street? Shit, next thing I know niggers in diapers... packin' Tec-9's be tryin' to take over my business. I said put me down! Put me down! She's in there. Esteban looking for you. Good for Esteban. Yo, why you stay with James? You know why, Fresh. Why? 'Cause his smack is the dope and he got plenty of it. You happy now? Why you don't go to Esteban, then? I don't like the way he looks at me. I don't need no spic pimp motherfucker lookin' at me like I'm no fucking queen. I'm just a sorry-ass nigger ho'. James here, he looks at me like I'm nothing, so I'm down with James. You ain't ain't nothin'. Michael, fuck off, all right? Don't Aunt Francis think you ain't nothin'. She think you somethin'. Aunt Francis is a fuckin' saint. Aunt Francis loves every damn dog in the street the same as she loves me. Ain't no shit to be loved by no fuckin' saint. I love you. I got him. Come on now. What's up, what's up? Ain't got nothin', homes. - Yo, what's up, nigger? - He ain't got nothin'. Watch him, watch him. Aw, shit, he finally got one in there! Curtis bad, homes. He be bustin' out those moves! Word, as long as I ain't playin' that nigger. He ain't doin' shit. Come on. What's up, shorty? Come on, come on. - Damn! - Yo, Red, man, pick him up, man. Man, you pick him up, motherfucker! Yo, Fresh, other court's open. Let's shoot some hoops. No, not right now, man. You just don't want me embarrassin' your ass... in front of none of them bitches, huh? Yo, don't be callin' her that, nigger. What, now you Mr. Tough Guy Nigger, huh? Now you Mr. Tough Guy Nigger? Hey, hey, what's up, what's up? Shit. Here, here, take that motherfucker. - Right here, right here. - Foul ball. Foul, motherfucker! That's a flagrant fuckin' foul! Hey, man, you okay? Man, fuck you, nigger! Little motherfucker gonna take that shit up... - I 'm gonna challenge him every time. - What? Challenge? Yo, don't be jumpin' on my boy like youre the fuckin' New York Knicks! Just forget about it, man. Your ball. Yeah, yeah, nigger, you know you ain't shit. Come on, man. Give me the ball. A shot, a shot! My man! Point game, motherfuckers, we up! Take the shot. Yo, Jake, what's up, man? Why you let that motherfucker play with you like that? What's up, man? Oooh! In your eye, whoa! Damn, she comin' over, man. - Yo, she be likin' you, man. What you say to her? - Shut up, man. Man, she in love with you, man. Yo, man, she wanna get with you, man. She like you, man. Come on, man. Let's go, man! Come on, man. Let's go! Yeah, go ahead, run, motherfuckers! Run! Y'all punk, pussy-ass, motherfuckers! That's right! Go tell somebody you saw somethin'! I come back for all of you monkey motherfuckers! You pussy-ass punks! That's right. Punk ass. Come on. Let's go. Come on. All right, I know it's hard, Michael. But you gotta help us with this one, all right? Just try to work with us. - We gotta find the guy who did this. - I didn't see nothin'. You were the only witness left on the scene. You're the only lead we got here. I just heard the shooting. Then I saw they was down. I didn't see nothin' else. Nothin'. Come on, Michael. You go wait in your room. I'll run you a hot bath. Go wait in your room now. Where you at? If your mind is somewhere else... then pick your ass up and take it over there and keep it company. I'm not having my time wasted by some half-ass, fishcake opponent today. Take the last move back. In fact, take back the last three. You're hoardin'. You're playin' each piece like losin' it hurts. This ain't checkers. You want my king. You got to come get my king. All these other pieces are just a means to do it. Every time you make a good run at me, I just threaten your queen and back you go. You're treatin' her like she's the last lady on earth. Your queen is just a pawn with a lot of fancy moves. Nothing more. When you see you're playin' a man who feels naked without his lady, use her. J ump in there and take her, tease her, threaten her... and he won't be able to think about his game anymore. That's when you make your real move. That's good. That's better. You like that horse, dont you? You like his crazy jumps all over the board. Think he's your friend, hate to lose him... almost as much as you hate to lose that lady. Well, he is your friend, boy. They all are. But you're gonna have to use him, just like you use the others. If he falls by the wayside, well, that's just life's little game, ain't it? And until you come ready to play her game, you'll never beat her at it. Check. Check. Check. Mate in six. Want to suffer through it? That's the first time you ever checked me. Want to come to my place to celebrate? I ain't supposed to be seeing you. You seeing me now, ain't you? I'm playing chess. Welcome to the Taj Mahal. You want a beer? - Uh-uh. - Well, that's all there is to drink. It's warm too. Tastes like a tub of piss somebody farted in. What side you playin'? White, black, black, both. You're losing the last two. Well, this first game here, I'm playing Teddy Kolevski. That's Frank Evans. That's Walter Shipman. Last game here, I'm playin' myself. You're losin' to yourself. Yeah, life's a bitch like that. I've kept a game going with myself for the last 20 years. Not a day goes by I don't make at least one move. Not a day. You're losing to homeboy Shipman too. Well, he's a U.S. Grand Master. That's right. He don't go to the park. But he comes here to play me. - He's winning. - Yeah, yeah, I know he's winning. But let me tell you something.

Played all them boys. Sometimes I won. Mostly I lost. But you put the show on speed... I chew all they asses up. All them Grand Masters and them Europeans... with they government subsidies and whatnot to sit on they asses and play all day... they ain't livin'in the world. Put the clock on 'em, put the heat on they backs, they break down. Put 'em in the park fishin' for dollars, and they break. That's Bobby Fisher. Some say hes the greatest player to ever play the game. I never played him. All them patzers sittin' around the park... waitin' for him to go back there like Jesus. Me, I don't give a shit. Put the clock on that motherfucker... I'll chew his ass up just like the rest of'em. Chew it right up. - That's some old cake, boy. - It's all right. I'm talkin' two, maybe three weeks here.

Why didn't he send one of his other boys? Darryl or Jake? Aint you heard nothin'? Aint you heard what Jake did? I heard what Jake did. The heat's all over Corky now. They don't know who shot up them courts... but them stupid niggers, they think that shit was over drugs.

Half of the phones in the hood tapped now. Can't be callin' from nowhere. None of his big connects gonna feed him now. Corky losin' crazy dollars. Man, he needs the shit today. He said for me to say he ain't gonna forget his friends... that helped him when he was in trouble, and he ain't gonna forget who didn't. I can't. I can't give out that much weight on consignment, not at a time like this. Any other time, I would've told Corky, "Yeah, it's cool, "but-- For now, he gonna pay up front, 'til all this blow over. How do I know you ain't gonna bring the heat down on me? All right. You go wait on 11th and Jane. It'll be there in an hour.

He's stupid. Why you doing this to him? Mind your own business, all right? Can't you at least tell him to shut up and don't be talkin' so much? It's a free country. Chuckie say what he want. It's quiet here. Yeah, I like to come here. It's lonesome. You know what's whack? When I'm down with the posse or home and shit... and everybody be screaming and yelling and shit?

Put it down, man! No! No! This place is a regular zoo, ain't it? But that's what you kids like, right? A visit to the fuckin' zoo? All right. Now listen, Michael, this is the second homicide youve been mixed up with in as many weeks. Now you expect me to believe this is some kind of coincidence? Now come on. How stupid do I look to you, huh? We already know what your friend was carryin' in his school bag. - You better come clean with us. - What was in the bag? You ain't askin' the questions here. What was in it? Fuck it. Fuck all you goddamn monkeys. I don't need this fuckin' aggravation. Perez, you like this fuckin' zoo so much, you play with the animals. All right, listen, Michael. When we got to your friend... the knapsack had been opened and everything in it was gone. Now we don't know what was in there, but I can guess. Now he was with you, and everybody knows what you've been doin' around the hood, man. We was on our way to my house and we got jumped. - That's it. - That's it, huh? I'm gonna ask you somethin', man. You think all those guys are your friends? Esteban and Jake and them? Hmm? Here. This is my personal number, and I'm there every night. Come on. Take it. All right, man. You know and I know that I can't hold you here on this... so, uh, you either are innocent or youre a helluva lot smarter than you look. Now either way, next time it's gonna be you laying in that street. Next time it's gonna be you. I'm sorry, Michael. That's the way it's gotta be. If it were just me, I wouldn't even consider it... but I got 11 other children to mind. They all scared to walk out the door with you to school. They even scared to sleep at night... case somebody's gonna come and shoot down the doors. I spoke to Miss Patterson at the Bushwick Group Home. She says there's gonna be an opening next month. I'm sorry about your friend. I'm sorry about all your friends... but you should have known better. I'm gonna miss you, Michael. Stop it! Stop it. Fucker! It's his fault! It's his fault! - Stop it! Stop it! Calm down. Calm down! - Fucker! Come on, Roscoe. Yo, come here. We gotta talk. Take a ride, man. Come on. Go for a ride, man. So I'm hearin'. Like all week I'm hearin' your little friend talkin' you runnin' base for Esteban. All over the motherfuckin' street. "We runnin' that base for Esteban." And I ask myself... "Why Esteban gotta be runnin' base?" It don't make no sense. So I said, "All right, well, maybe that little loudmouth spic got it all wrong. Maybe he's too stupid to know what he's carryin'. " These are so cute. You know what this is? Look at it. - What is it? - Looks like base. That's right, little man. $5,000 worth of pure base cocaine. You didn't even look to see what you was carryin', did you? You just a little kid in way over his head. I know that. But Esteban got to be sent a message about hornin' in on my business. And I'm afraid you gonna have to be my little telegram. I wasn't runnin' no base for no Esteban. - What? - I ain't runnin' no base for no Esteban. Oh, no? Well, who was it for, then, Santa Claus? Who was it for? He gonna kill me if I say. I'm gonna ice you right now if you don't. It was Jake. Yo, I'm gonna smoke this little motherfucker right now! Drop that shit, motherfucker. You should have came correct. What the fuck's goin' on, man? Huh? What the fuck you mean you was runnin' for Jake? You know them times Jake be gettin' mad and don't wanna be payin' me... and I gotta come ax you for the money? He be takin' $50 out of every hundred you be givin' me. Same with all his runners, only they too scared to ax you for they money. He's lyin', man. He's cold, motherfuckin' lyin'! Shut the fuck up, Jake! He be buyin' base and sellin' it out on the side. He be usin' me for runs all the time. Yo, man, what the fuck is wrong-- Yo, chill, man. Yo. Chill, all right? I'm not packin' shit. Relax, man. Yo, Corky, this is bullshit, man. This is bullshit! I'm with Jake all the fuckin' time, man. - I never seen none of this shit. - He Jakes homeboy. He with Jake when Jake send me on runs. They be like talkin' about it, how they gonna fuck you up. They be like, "We gonna fuck up Corky. Then we gonna be the man. " Im just lucky you ain't send Jake and Red together to pick me up. - I been dead 'fore I got here. - Yo, Corky, this is bullshit, man. Yo, this is the worst fuckin' shit I ever heard in my whole life, man. Why was your little friend blabbin' about Esteban this, Esteban that... all over the fuckin' hood for then? I was scared to get jumped on my runs... so I took Chuckie with me... and he be askin' me questions all the time... who we runnin' for and all. Jake said he'd kill me if I tell, so I tell Chuckie Esteban. I ain't know he gonna be tellin' it to the whole world. Jake said if I talk... he gonna dead me as dead as Curtis in that playground. Okay, okay, h-hold on. Corky, I-I don't know what's goin' on, man. All right? B-But this little motherfucker is lyin'! - He's lyin', man! - You know Hector? The guy I used to make runs from? Jake sent me to him. He tell me I gotta tell him I be gettin' that dope for you. Just ax Hector. Yeah, this is Corky. I wanna talk to Hector. Yo, Hector. Y-- Listen, man, I was-- What? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all right to talk. What the fuck you talkin' about? He told you that. And you gave it to him? Oh, no, no, no, I ain't mad. You just one stupid motherfucker and you ain't never gonna see a goddamn cent of my business, but I ain't mad. Yo, get fucked, Hector. - Ah! Shit! - Corky! Corky, man, listen, man. Look, we been workin' for you for three fuckin' years, man. Why you gonna believe this spotty little motherfucker? - Huh? Why? - Why for Esteban gonna be runnin' base? You know he be hatin' that shit. - And if he did it, why he gonna do it like that? - Corky! Okay. All right, Corky. Maybe... Maybe it ain't Esteban. He did it hisself, man. Okay? This spotty little motherfucker, he did it hisself!. Where I'm gonna get $5,000, man? Where I'm gonna get it? You always tryin' to scare me, but I ain't scared of you no more. You can kill me all you want, but I lie for you no more! So you gonna be the man, Jake. You gonna be the man, huh? - You gonna be the man. - Corky, Corky, listen. Yo, Red! Jake's the man now... and you his number one G. His number one G! All right, boy. You made it this far. Now you wanna get out of here, you gonna tell me who was Jake's distributor. Who'd you run the base to, boy? - It was James. - What James? He got like that store over near Beachwood Projects. James be runnin' smack, Corky. He a "H" boy... and it ain't our problem. Nigger cut into my product, know that shit is mine... then turn around and sell it without cutting me in, that shit is my problem! And we gonna pay my problem a visit and solve it. He ain't there. He out all day, but he there after 6:00. Jake never want me to deliver to no one but James himself, and I always gotta wait in that store 'til James show up. He be there after 6:00. So. You finally decided to track me down. You should've come to me right away. I couldn't. There was polices all over the house all the time and in the street. They be watchin' me all the time, but I didn't tell 'em nothin'. They mad 'cause they can't do nothin' about it. So? Who jump you, little homie? I heard you was took off the street today by a couple of Corky's boys. Is that who done it? Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's me, Esteban. Your main man. Now you tell me what's happening... and I promise ain't nothing gonna happen to you. Was it Corky's boys? Theyjumpyou? - Why? - Conejo, man. Corky must be buggin' out. He know better than to be doin' that shit. It was a couple of those punk kids he got workin' for him. He probably know nothing about it. Corky be sendin' 'em. Corky said he tired of runnin' base. See the way you is, livin' large and all that. So he wanna be switchin' over to that smack. It could be. All the connects know you ain't gonna like that, hermano. They probably didn't give him nothin'. They could've figured to be jumping your runs. Maybe sell it himself. Maybe just to make a statement. Ah... it could be. So... how did you come to find out about all these interesting developments? Look, time is money, and money is time, little homie. And right now, you are costing me a lot of both. - You gonna get mad. - Look, it would be very difficult... to get me any madder than I am already. You gonna get real mad. Nicky told me. Your sister? What about your sister? Promise you ain't gonna get ma-- Look, I promise you don't cut this shit out, I'm gonna piss acid on your head, you hear me? When you axed me where was Nichole... I told you my aunt won't let her out the house? I was lyin' to you. She move out. She down with this nigger James. -James? - He got that store-- I know who James is. Nicky say James tired of he be so small-time... wanna be movin' out bigger, so he be takin' the smack from Corky... and sellin' it out in his store 'cause Corky promised him... he gonna get rid of you. I only lied to you 'cause I didn't want you to get mad at my sister. Nicky said she's sick and tired of you, bein' married and with kids and all. And James be treatin' her nice and nasty. That's how she said it: "nice and nasty." I went over there to talk to her so that she be comin' back to you... but I know she still be goin' back there sometimes... for her clothes and stuff she be keepin' over there-- Chillie, call the apartment. Better not be mixin' none of this shit up, little homie. - Understand me? - It's straight up, Esteban, word. Corky be goin' over to Jamess store every night... to set up they business and all. Whenever I go to see Nicky at night, Corky be there. You know he gonna be there tonight. No answer. Looks like some kind of fuckin' war council or some shit. Conejo. It's gonna be the shortest fuckin' war anyone ever fought. Word, 'mano. Fucking word. My little homie's on the money. My little money G. Okay, Sal, let's do it. Herbie, you make sure your ass stays here 'til you see with your own eyes it's all done.

Where you goin', man? Back in here! Get the fuck in here! Who are you, man? I don't even know who you are, man. - Shut up. - Man, what you doin'in here? What is this about, man? Do you know? Hey, man, you don't know me. - I don't know you. - Shut the fuck up and get down and stay there! - You fuckin' crazy or what? - Hey! Comin'in here. You bust into my crib. Hey, where the fuck you goin', man? Hey! - This is my thing. - Are you interested in my business? Huh? You gonna fuck with me, nigger? You wanna fuck my woman? You wanna fuck what's mine? There's no woman here, man. No woman stay here. - Oh, no? - This is my place. I'm the only motherfucker here. You fuckin' wearin' lingerie? What's this, motherfucker? What is this, huh?

'Mano, you should head home tonight. - This is my own business, Sal. - Yose, papa. I'll just walk you to the door, then cut out, okay? I'll feel better. First, you drop off my little money man... and then you hit that spot by the river and you ditch the firepower, you got me? Spike, you switch places with Herbie after that. I don't want this fuckin' pussy doin' nothing else tonight. Drive this car somewhere upstate and put it in a lake. I don't want to see it ever again. Tusabes? Hey, my little money man. You're a real man now. Hey, look, don't worry. I am not going to do anything to harm your sister, okay? I'm going to try to work it out with her. You be real chill 'til the end of the week.

Get back in here, nigger. This ain't where you live at. You stupid, man? It's 1 0:00. You think I'm goin' home now? I'm gonna head over to my friend Nicholas right up there. Yo, you want to baby-sit him all fuckin' night, maricon? Vamanos, motherfucker. We outta here, man. Hey, kid, you want something here? Yeah, I gotta use the phone. I gotta make a phone call. - Payphone's outside. - It's outside, I know. I be goin' right out. I couldn't go home. I couldn't go there with everybody askin' me questions and all. So you come here? I got no place else to go. Put the bag down. Why you always carrying that around with you? Does it look like school to you? Your sister is telling me that you called her this morning and told her... your father wanted to see her at the rehab center in Staten Island... Like an emergency, right? And she gone all the way up there, and your father... he's not checked in no more, is that true? Michael, why you lyin' to him? I ain't lyin'. So youre going to tell me that he's lying about James too, right? I can see whoever I want. No. No. Not exactly. Now you can see whoever you want... except for James. No, you can't see him. You can't see him no more. Now maybe you can visit him in his new place of residence... but, you know, I don't think he's going to be so much fun no more. You don't own me. I'm nobody's slave. No. You are a slave to the pudra blanca... the god of white dreams, and I am his master, me. And as long as he is mine, so areyou. You are mine. Nicky, don't walk away from me like that. What the fuck is this, Grand Central Station? - Who the fuck is it? - Police. Open the door. - You got a warrant? - We got a complaint of assault and battery from a neighbour. Now open the door or we're takin' it down. Hey, I got me a 1 2-8 on my private number, man. Looks Like all those cards I been handin' out paid off, hey, 'mano? - Hey, I 'm not your brother, Perez, so fuck you too. - Ohh.

So this is where you keep your girlfriends, hey, 'mano? It's a cheap-lookin' joint if I may say so myself, man. I never did figure you for no class, but this might be pushing it. You all right, miss?
