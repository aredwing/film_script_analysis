They're from Edinburgh, Scotland and they're very punk rock. # Jesus don't want me for a sunbeam # Sunbeams are not made like me # Don't expect me to cry # For all the reasons you had to die # Don't ever ask your love of me # Don't expect me to cry # Don't expect me to lie # Don't expect me to die for thee # Jesus don't want me for a sunbeam # Sunbeams are not made like me # Don't expect me to cry # For all the reasons you had to die # Don't ever ask your love of me # Don't expect me to cry # Don't expect me to lie # Don't expect me to die for thee # Don't expect me to cry # Don't expect me to lie # Don't expect me to die for thee # Jesus don't want me for a sunbeam # Sunbeams are not made like me # Don't expect me to cry # For all the reasons you had to die # Don't ever ask your love of me # Don't expect me to cry # Don't expect me to lie # Don't expect me to cry # Don't expect me to die # Don't expect me to lie # Don't expect me to cry for thee. # # Come on over and do the twist # Ahh haa # Overdo it and have a fit # Ahh haa # Love you so much, it makes me sick # Ahh haa # Come on over and shoot the shit # Ahh haa # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Come on over and do the twist # Ahh haa # Overdo it and have a fit # Ahh haa # Love you so much, it makes me sick # Ahh haa # Come on over and shoot the shit # Ahh haa # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # Beat me outta me # She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart # She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart # She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart # She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart # She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart # She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart # She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart # She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart. # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE.
