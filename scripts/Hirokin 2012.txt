Viceroy, our king, my lord, such deeds should be left for those better suited for them. Arid or human, they must all admire you. Admiration is short-lived. Then think of economics. At this rate, there will be no strong men for either work or entertainment. Take him to the pit. Rest assured I shall find moss. And when I do, I will destroy him and his gig beliefs. They are close. Human. I can see that. Hirokin? It's not good to know each other. How are we going to make our world safe for them, for our children? These humans, they come to our planet, they steal our resources, they spread infertility among our women and what did we do? We stood idly by and watched 'em. How long are we going to allow the Griffin to enslave us, to take our men, to torture our women? Are we that different from these humans because our palms reveal our blood? How does it come that a human can treat an arid so warmly? Not all humans are the same, my beloved. Wait here. Viceroy? What is your bidding? So? And the shavings of aradium will make your weapon soar. My people do not need to be told the properties of our aradium. So. I have the cure here. Apostate! - You! - What? - I knew we couldn't trust a human. - I didn't. - Well then help us. - Run! Kill them all. My advice to you... run. Get word to moss... he must retreat. If word does not get to moss on time, the rebellion will fail. Yes sir. Don't touch her, human! Come on. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Which one? Finley. That was seven years ago. I know. You know, we don't have to do this. I'll be back before first meal. We've come so close. We can't turn back now. We're really close to the horde. Deacons could be anywhere. We can't turn back now. If I get this trade, we can live anywhere. And nuran, he'll have a future. Blue tea. We all do what we have to do. Last I heard your name, it was tied to the massacre at the town of eleven. You believe everything you hear? Only half of what I see. It's not what we discussed. - This is better. - Not for you to decide. This is all I have. Hirokin! You're the only man within weeks of here with the cure. Then you understand its value. Mercy, brother. Mercy. My child is sick. She needs that medicine. - Those who will not help cannot be helped. I know who you are. Do you? How can you be so selfish? We all do what we must. - Deacons! - Deacons, deacons! Run, go now! Nuran? Nuran! Go! Get inside! It's time to practice our cloaking. Quickly, sweetheart, quickly. - It's okay. - Completely silent, nuran, like we practiced. Shhh. Show yourselves. Come out. Human, I'm human. We thought you were vandals, so we took cover. We don't want any trouble. We're just passing through. Have you seen an arid named moss? No. I see she wears the arid ribbon. Did she bear that child? Yes. We were just passing through. Come, we have a long walk ahead of us. Uh-uh-uh-uh. Where are you headed? East, following the food. I have something for you. Easy. It's worth at least 100 gigs. More like a thousand. Just let us go, it's all yours. I'll decide what's mine. We don't want any trouble. Trouble? Oh, my friend, you're in a world of trouble. Run. Come on. No! Take this one to the pit. Perhaps he'll do better there. - Attention, the games will begin in 10 marks. Attention, place your bets. The games will begin in 10 marks. My daughters... this is the last place I wanted to see them. They want to know what you're willing to die for. - All right, keep it going. - Take a sip. Keep it going. Here you go. Have it. - Come on, speed up the line. - That's enough. All right. Next one. Step on up. - That's enough there. Get going. Here you go. All right, all right, all right. Here he comes. Here he comes. - Hey, one sip. - Ugh. - They say he's a sympathizer. - An arid sympathizing. Uh-hmm, close with the rebel leader moss. Well, I have an idea. Let's sell him the gig blade that the human brought. Yeah, but what if he tries to rip us off again? Simple... whatever he asks, we want five. - Five. - Five. And what do you have for me today, gentlemen? - Love stick. - Attention. The games will begin... The gig kind. What, are you just gonna look at it all day? - Attention... - It's looking good on you. Oh yeah... really brings out your eyes. Two palm roots for this one. Five. Five. It's worth at least five. Five? Seriously? What human wants an arid blade? They're too heavy to be of any use. Oh no, you don't. If you want it, that means it's worth something. - You're not gonna rip us off again. - Rip you off? Gentlemen, have you entirely forgotten that precious blue tea I brought you? Yeah, I remember. Oh yeah. Oh wow, that... - that was great blue tea. - Really great. - It was really great. - Two. I think two is good. We should take two. I thought you wanted five? All right, but two's good. Let's just take two. All right. Deal and we'll call it even. Almost. So why don't we add this little trinket here and we have a deal. Two blue. Two for two. All right, that's a deal! You wanted five. I wouldn't get five. This belong to you? They say you were defending an arid woman and her child. That's right... arid. I don't call anyone a gig. Perhaps I will bet on you. Bet on death. I always do. That's what keeps me alive. Here... For a little strength. Walk strong in the wei, my friend. Attention. The games will begin now. Civilization is a delicate balance. I must weigh what the people want against what I know they need. - Pheon! - Terra? And they need stability, order, discipline. And these I give them, orange. She is pretty. Did you enjoy last night? I enjoyed it very much. Such a beautiful vessel, but empty. I'm more than just a vessel. You used to understand that. Anyone with sight would understand that. Perhaps I'm blind. I will give you an heir. It's only a matter of time. Obedience to my word... Is my freedom. I am a father to a civilization. I will not be forgotten. Hirokin! Hirokin! I will not fight! I will not kill another arid! Then you die! All right, you gigs all know the rules. Kill your opponents, save your loved ones from the spike. I love you. Hirokin! No! Impressive. No. No-ooo. Mother! Daddy! Renault! Mother! No. - No. - Yes! Hirokin. Don't let go. No! Kore, you tell me you rounded up this human with that whore. And her child. - Let her go! - He won the fight. According to the rules the woman is free. Indeed, rules. Where would we be without them? No. - Yes, viceroy. - Hold on. I'm here. Don't let go. Hold on. Hold on. No no! No no! Hirokin! No! No! Moss and his remaining rebels - are of little threat. - Find him, kore. Many underestimate the invisible enemy. Moss is remaining hidden, but rest assured the time will come when he and his people will take form. That is the wei. I will find him. Perhaps you should not return until you do. That would be wise. As you wish... My lord. Dead. - Dead. - This one's still breathing. Not anymore. Did you see that human in the pit? - The bony one? - No, the fat one. - There was a fat human in the pit? - No! You know, I don't know why I hang out with you sometimes. I do like 'em with a little bit of meat on 'em. You like what with a little bit of meat on 'em? Humans, arids... doesn't really matter, so long as there's a little bit of meat on 'em. Right. What are you gonna do with 'em - when you're done? - Done doing what? Stickin' 'em. Wait a minute, what did you think I was talking about? I don't know what you're talking about. It keeps changing. First you were talking about a human in the pit, a bony one. Now you're talking about stickin' 'em. It's very confusing. Wait. Look, isn't that him? Yeah. He's a little bony, isn't he? Yeah, he needs a little meat on him. Oh, you know what I heard? I heard that he was with a fertile arid. - No! - Yeah, and he's a murderer. - Murderer. - Hmm, town of eleven, something like that. So they killed a bunch of arid rebels. Guess Griffin appreciated that. That's what you call appreciation. Huh. All right, I'm gonna stick him. Oh, careful. Don't get stuck. Oh yeah, right. What was that? Got a nice ring to it. It's okay. It's a good thing you ate that life root, my friend. Otherwise this would be a very one-sided conversation. - Oh no... my boy. - No time for grieving. Now is the time to run. Why are you helping me? We all have our motives. A friend of mine had a vision and I believe it is of you. Quick, we must move fast. Wait. Where are we? Half a day from the horde. I've taken you as far as I can. See that red star? Keep walking toward that star. You'll eventually find a friend of mine. His name is moss. If he's managed to escape the deacons, he'll be able to help you. Here. To steady your feet. Walk strong in the wei, my friend. Is this life worth living? Bet you wish you were dead. He's a human. He can't be trusted. He shouldn't be here. He's putting us in danger. We should leave him immediately. He needs our help. Honsu must have sent him to us for a reason. How do we know this scum didn't steal the medallion? For all we know, he killed honsu. There's little danger in helping him to recover. Helping him puts our tribe at risk. It puts your daughter at risk. You have to drink. Here. Good. Gabriel, go find your brother. Water? Go on. There's a constant search for water. Our tribe once went two moons without finding a drop. The water will come because we are strong in the wei. Come. We grind the thorns. There's a numbing agent which helps with injury. See. Look. This is how the arid people see ourselves... as part of a system rooted to hold one another together. Maren, water! See. Our thoughts become our words. Our words... our words become our actions. Our actions become our habits. Our habits become our values. Our values. And our values become our destiny. Moss, what you're asking of us is suicide. The apostate won't spare a single soul. It is only a matter of time before they find us. Time. We must unite as one tribe, Cain, if we are not to be snuffed out like a candle. You can't save everyone. The tribes will be uniting at dead rock. Look at your own existence. Does it hold any meaning to you if there is no one else to share the light? And what meaning is there in death? He will reveal us for a reward the first chance he gets. I trust you'll keep an eye on him and maren too. Homemade arid redbush. Only a few tribes make it. We trade it for what we need. Careful. It tastes awful. But it'll make you forget your troubles. You know, we did help save your life, the least you could do is speak. "Yes, maren, I do appreciate all your tribe has done for me. What is your time?" I'm the second oldest daughter of my tribe. "My goodness! I thought you were much older. Thank you for the redbush. I enjoyed it very much." Good night, maren, second oldest daughter in her tribe. Maren? I missed you last night at the singing. I missed being there. I need to help him, Cain. Help him or help us? - Maybe they're the same. - I wish... I wish things were that simple, maren, but life never is. Beautiful, isn't it? I don't know. It feels cold, lonely. Amazing how such a small thing can determine so much. Some say the lines tell our future. Does that mean I have no future? I can't live one more day like this, on the outside... not arid and not human. I mean, who are we? We're on the outside because we don't belong. You chose this life, not me. Audowen? She's bleeding. She's bleeding everywhere. Please. Please, my baby... Let me see her. Audowen? Audowen? Every ribbon, a song. A ribbon for every life we are blessed with. Listen. Even in death, there is life. Hmmm, moss is close. I leave at first light. - Returning to the horde? - Yes. - Why? - Revenge. This futile revenge, why can't humans just understand that we all breathe the same air? We drink the same water. We cry the same tears. I've seen you before, my friend. I have seen you in the battlefield of my mind. You have been sent to unite the tribes. I'm not the answer you're looking for. Am I mad? Hmm? The wei brought him here! Shhh. A lot of suffering comes with believing in the wei. Suffering. What do you know of suffering? That is our tribe. It has been hunted down. As sure as night follows day, they will come, my friend. No hope. You? You can change... The world. My friend, stay with us, - learn our trade... - No, thank you. No hope, no change unless you unite the tribes. No, thank you. Maren! - Maren. - Our clothing, to keep you cooler as you need and warmer as you need. Nothing kills our spirit. - Cain? - Cain holds on too tight. Sometimes holding on is all you can do. All you can do is accept the truth and let go. How do you do that? You just do. It's time for me to leave. "Sword for the downtrodden." "Hirokin." That's what your name means in the old tongue. "Hero." Fights for something greater than himself. I fight for them. They're dead. They're free now. - But I'm not. - No, you're not. Not until the Griffin's dead, I'm not. The Griffin will tear you from limb to limb. Then show me. You think this is a game? Come here. Put your hand up. Let's play. Push me over. Do your best. Yes. Whoa! Huh? Fun? Fun, isn't it? This little game. Ahhh. Ahhh. What was that? I won't sanction another massacre! You're not ready! Stop, wait! - Show me. - Show you what? How to lead my sheep like a wolf? Until you learn the secrets of the wei, you'll simply be another slaughter for Griffin's horde. You're not ready. She was your wife. Yes? You wonder why you couldn't save her. Acceptance is the wei. I can tell you a lot of suffering comes from the wei. Every time I turn around, a child is left fatherless because of your precious wei. I mean, don't you think you're just twisting it to mean what you need it to mean when you mean it? Yes! Yes! That's the spirit! The power of the imagination, my friend, is a very powerful thing. Indulge me. Imagine a leaf... imagine a Jasmine leaf. Indulge me. Try harder. It is imperative that you visualize what it is I'm about to tell you. We arids have an innate connection to the world around us... the soil, the land. These are the fundamentals. This is the wei. It is not mere coincidence that only arids believe in the wei. Our genetic makeup is physically different than that of a human. It is truly connected to our surrounding. A millennia ago there was an elite communion of arids so connected to their realities, they were able to unfold time. They were able to see the outcomes of decisions before they committed them. This special ability terrified the humans. A campaign was started to wipe the planet clean of the arid race and all knowledge of our gift erased. And after a thousand years of slavery and genocide, our arid race has forgotten who we are. Unfolding time has become a myth. The scorched planet renders most of our women infertile. We are the light. The light isn't outside. It's inside here and it flows out into the world. And so, who are you? Human. Ahhh. Has it not seemed odd to you that I am able to see your thoughts? Hmm? I've been able to sense your connection since the day we scraped you out of the desert. You were born of this world not completely human, not completely arid. Your connection to the wei is the strongest I've ever encountered. When you fall inside my eyes, do you go with the flow or do you struggle against me? Amazing how such a small thing can determine so much. I'll fix it. No, you won't. This is who you are. Your shame is haunting you. Let it go. We create our own reality, my friend. Reality does not create us. - That's convenient. - Convenient? Your wife... That boy, they're just memories now. I tried with everything I am... But I couldn't... I couldn't do it. I couldn't save her. You are what you create now. The light is hiding inside you. Let it flow. In order to unfold time, let go of all the fear, all the emotions, all the thoughts. That is the wei. Begin to see the folds of time then... See the choices. Allow your senses to walk you forward. Hear the sounds. Believe in one choice without doubt. That belief in that choice... Will make it real. It's all in the mind. You just have to assemble the pieces as one! Your vision creates your reality. You're letting him leave? Time has come. I'm going with him. We'll be at dead rock in two suns. If you want to get to Griffin, then take me with you. Give me your hand. Come on. Give it. Take care of your tribe. They're what matters. Attention, place your bets. The games will begin in five marks. - She cannot give you what you desire. - Can you? Attention, place your bets. The games will begin... I hope you find this view more enjoyable than your last. I'll enjoy nothing but the sight of my son. How beautiful you are, terra. I mean, your convictions. You shouldn't be here. - Your father... - Will be overjoyed when I return home with a good trade. Commander, we've received word from the informant that moss and his rebels will be gathering at dead rock. Very good, Deacon. Set our course and send word to the viceroy. The mind is its own place. I, myself, can turn joy into torment or torment into joy. Prison into a sanctuary. Or a sanctuary into a prison. Where's my son? Play nice now. Why am I here? I want a child and you want a better life. We are gifts to each other. Perhaps undeserving. We're not so different, you and I. We both have need. I would like you to be with me at my side today. He will be there. Yes, your son. Join me with a smile and you will get your desire. Very well. Hirokin? Is it true what they say about you? The town of eleven? Yes. Innocent blood. Where do we find your friend? We don't. He'll find us. Hey, lookie who it is. Oh, that's the human from the pit. Definitely had more meat on him. - What is wrong with you? - Kind of brave showing up here without any disguise of any sort. What you mean no disguise? He's got on a cloak. The only one who'd know it was him is a meat lover like you. Huh yeah, I wonder what he wants. Probably trade. So this is moss' arid rebellion... a child and a human. Honsu. I bet they have arid liquor. I like your thinking, my friend. I like your thinking. Has your father gone completely mad? My father is very well, thank you. - And you've met hirokin? - Yes. The scrapper I worked so hard to get out of here. Welcome back. You can get me next to the viceroy? The viceroy? You? Against his legions? Come. Follow me. There's nothing quite so satisfying as the conquest of innocence. I brought this for you. It's exceptionally sweet, so naturally I thought of you. Sweet indeed. I won't give in to him. You have no other choice. No one does. I'm sorry I couldn't take you another way. Only one may enter. Not what you were expecting? Not sure what I was expecting. One thing is certain... you're here to barter. The question is do you have anything of interest for me? I'm not in the mood for games. Griffin's not an easy man to get next to. You managed. Yes, I did. For now. Griffin needs an heir and he thinks I can't give him one. But I think the problem lies elsewhere. Get me close to him and it won't matter. Are you telling me you're not the slightest bit tempted? It could be fun. The chains cut deep. I knew you looked familiar. Quite touching how you fought to save her. You know, I had a baby once. Or rather I once gave birth. I'm sorry. Griffin will leave the pit momentarily with terra. Oh. You didn't know? Terra's very much alive. But I see you've already found a replacement... a younger one, much prettier. She's alive? Terra? Why not see for yourself? My thoughts... thoughts... Become actions, actions become words, words... Become habits. Deacon. Nuran! Oh, my son. My sweet sweet sweet son! Oh, I missed you! I love you so much! My prince of the horde. So much for your rebellion. Maybe this is our fault. Maybe we were not strong enough in the wei. Look around you. Your stupid wisdom - is killing our people! - There is nothing foolish... About the struggle for freedom. If you can win. But you can't. So why not live with the way things are instead of resisting and killing us off one by one? You see the world through the eyes of fear. And you see nothing at all! We are not afraid of the path that lies ahead. Gig whores... pay a little extra get them a wee bit fresher. - What your pleasure, yeah? - That one. Mercy, brother, mercy. I am not afraid of the path I have chosen. We are not afraid. Enough! Deacons! Oh! Whoa! He's a bit dramatic, isn't he? Quite fancy and he's talented. No no! Stop the gig whore! She's getting away! And so it begins. Subtle. - Excellent form. - I like him. I think that's a bit provocative. Now what? - Run. - Good plan. - Oh, see? - Coming this way? Oh, trouble. Oh, somebody's in trouble? Gentlemen, we need an escape. - Arid liquor. - And blue tea. - Right this way. - It's our smuggler's exit. Whatever works. Have you seen three rebels? Uh, yeah, they went that way. Do you know the rebel? No. Are you in the habit of calling out to strangers? He's the father. He survived. You're starting to sound scared, viceroy. You're beginning to disappoint me, terra. - Let my son go! - Where? The desert to perish? To join the rebels and be slaughtered? Nuran needs protecting! I keep him safe! I keep you safe. No! No! Stop. Release my son and I'll submit. Oh, I require much more than submission. - Rebellion! - Rebellion! The chosen one has come to overthrow the horde. The tribes are uniting at pilot rock! All the tribes are united! The chosen one has come to defeat the horde! Everyone moves to pilot rock! - Where's moss? - No one knows. They say one man killed 20 deacons with a single blade! From face to foot, he was awashed with blood. His every movement timed to perfection. He came to confront a man, but he painted the destiny. Yes! Well, this is subtle. Yeah, I have a talent for subtlety. Indeed you do. Commander, we have received word that a human rebel has attacked the horde, and that arids are gathering around the rebel. It matters not. The resistance is the threat. Without moss, they are divided. He remains our target. Moss is the key to this rebellion. Cain, is that you? We all have to choose at some point, don't we? Spare my people. The viceroy wants you alive. - Just you. - That wasn't part of the deal. You said you wouldn't hurt anyone else. Moss is the one you want. He's the threat. Take him. You're lucky to be alive. Cain. On your knees, rebel. We became a people today, because of you. This world belongs to all of us now. No more hiding. Father was right. Our vision will become our reality. I'm sorry. They're alive. That's what matters. Time to let go. Time to plan. I don't want to see another child brought down to their knees again. Why me? I'm here because of you and you because of me. I don't understand and I don't try to. That is the wei. We just accept what is. Maren. I... Do you not favor me? Yes. Yes, I do. You are beautiful. But... I can't. Why? Because I'm arid? No. Because I'm bound. I will be for a long time. Then I'll wait... For you. - Another group just arrived. - And moss? Let it be known that this man for his defiance inside the horde's walls Sword for the downtrodden! Yeah! Hiro! Hiro! Hiro! We're here to fight at your side at your command. Stand up. Once... I fought because I had nothing to live for. Now I fight because I have seen everything worth dying for. We have a chance to do what moss said we would do, to take form as a people. Yeah! We fight for moss' vision of a world united! - For moss! - For moss! Yes! So when does this grand battle of yours begin? We attack at first light. Your rebel is beginning to annoy me. I have his people, I have his son, I have his wife and yet he still hasn't attacked. You don't have me. No! No! Viceroy? Not now! A matter of great importance. Hold that thought. Do you want to see what defying the viceroy gets you? It is better to rule in war than serve in peace. Well done, kore. So... The mighty moss, leader of the gig rebellion... broken. You will never break our spirit! Defiant to the last breath. It's our wei. You still have the power to save the pathetic lives of your people. Only in death does freedom begin. Oh, he will come. And he... Will unfold time. And you will blow away like breath, Griffin. You fool. And now the deaths of your people are your own doing. Keep him alive, kore. Let him be a witness to his glorious life's final achievement. What is the key to our success, kore? Timing, my lord. Timing. You didn't think we wouldn't be ready for you? No. What is it that you want? You dead! Think very carefully, for at the end of your life you will be remembered for this moment, hirokin. We choose life without fear, without you. But you're in no position to make any demands. Aren't I? He's arrogant. He's dead. Great battles define great men. Kill them all. What are you doing? We're going to play war. They're quite determined. It's who they are. Kore! Ha ahhh! Calm down. This won't take long. No-ooo! No! No! Shut this child up! Obedience to your word... Is your freedom. Now you kids play nice-nice. Let him be! Your vision creates your reality. That is the sentient wei. Right, moss? Moss here dreams of peace, but look around. A strong will must exert itself over the weak. That is reality. That is the way of my world! Hirokin! Nuran. Promise me... ...you'll take care of your mother. I promise. It's your family. No! Hirokin! No no! Hirokin, no! Fight for me! No! No! Loss and love carve heroes. Each ribbon, a song left behind in the struggle for freedom. Yesterday I had a dream. I saw a man fight for something greater than himself... For freedom. He rose against fear and tyranny, and thereafter everyone was born free. What a dream.
