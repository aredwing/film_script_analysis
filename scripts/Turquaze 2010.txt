When I was in the late sixties to Belgium, we were, to my great delight, greeted by a Flemish brass. I immediately felt at home. My big dream was to own ever in a marching band playing. But alas, there was in my life no room for my passion. But perhaps was not so bad. Tell me, son. Have you in Belgium ever seen a Turk at the fanfare? I'm not going back to Belgium. Why not? - Nothing. How long are you staying? - No idea. I will send Zehra here? No, son, Zehra her place is with you. Thanks for the offer, but it is not necessary. Brother, do you remember how in the summer stairs were a game? I remember especially our grandparents. When we went back to Belgium, they waved from the terrace. Have you been thinking about your future? It is time that you are getting married. Getting married? Why start it now, brother? Dad was just buried, and then I to get married think? Was this idea of u200bu200ba mother? As long as you with a Muslim home. If anything, call it. Pay attention to those two, okay, son? Bora may I withdraw. We have saved us, brother. Zehra but if it likes, we eat in the evening with you. Everything good? - Yes. And you? - Fine. Gift from Istanbul. Do you not like? Yes dear, yes. Yes, I think it's a bit kitsch, but I think it's very sweet. Trkiye, made in China. Those Chinese have cheated us well again, huh? I'm with the band. With the fanfare? Why? My father was fond of bands... You know already what? In my neighborhood there is one. When are you going to play again for me, baby? If I'm good enough. You say that for so long. I'm going to the toilet. Can I pay? Please. - Thank you. If you die, you also get buried in Turkey? Sarah, please. I continue. Already? I go to my brother. My sister cooks. Nice. I'll see you later then, darling? - Yes. Why do not you call when you later? - No more credit. Next time you come on time. And put that hat off. I can not come tomorrow night. How's school? Give your brother even answer. And I do not want to hear Flemish. - Why not? Of the father might not. That used to be, brother, when you were still living at home. And when we speak Zehra learn it.

He does not say much about it actually. Well Sarah, you are more than one year together and you know almost nothing of his family. Who is that? Timur has nobody of our family met, of course. We will be Sunday Mom and Dad to a concert at the Bijloke. That's not true. You and Timur? With Mom? So they know it? - Yes. And? Well... How did they do? Sarah. You have not told that he is a Turk. They will see. Who are ecstatic, you know that? And when they hear that you and Stef apart go, we are very pleased. I have what she wanted to tell this weekend, but I just wait a moment. I do not want Sun all starting to freak out. Let's flip, Anneke. If you have longer delay, she hears it from another. That should tell you. Well, come on. Yes, that's true. I'd like to propose to Timoen. Timoen would like us the band will play. Paul, it's Timur, 'primeval'. Yes, Ur. You know what, I'm just Tim. What do you play? - Blue Bolero 'by Abdullah Ibrahim. From whom? - Ibrahim Abdullah. He has a preference for difficult names. You know what? Just play something you know. Can the bass me a 7 / 8 show? It's at 15:00, the concert Sunday. Tamam. Dutch. - 'Tamam' is 'okay'. No, it's not Tamam. My parents invite us. I'm out. - What? Do not you stay asleep? Bora is home alone. Hey, what are you doing? - Who is that? My cousin in Turkey. - Cousin... Fuck you. Who is that? She's dead. Sorry. I just miss you. Ediz? How are you? Where have you been? I've already weeks not seen in the cafe. I'm going to Orkan. - To Orkan? But why? Because it is full of Turks. They have a large plasma TV. - You have betrayed me. But for a friend, everything you do. Next time I'm with you. You give him so big already well fed. - He's as stubborn as he grows up. That will surely be easy? - You can not rush children. Believe me, you know what you're getting, but you do not know where you end. Anyway, then we only once off. Come, my son. Tell me day by Ediz. Tell me days. - Bye. Could you step aside, Ediz? I'm watching. Are there any Turkish channels anymore? - I'm trying to learn Flemish. By looking at something? - Yes. Musti, Musti, Musti... I have a girlfriend. I would imagine it this weekend. - That's good. It seems very nice. Surely a Turkish? Who cares? We have just buried father. Shame on you. Fuck you all a believer. You do not talk about my girlfriend, brother. You know her. - I'm your older brother. I talk like I want. Stop it, Ediz. - Mind your own business. They never set foot in this house. - Then I do not anymore. Take it with me too. Eyes closed. What do you think, Anne? Sexy or sober? What is this question? Sober for when you're old and ugly. What is the problem with you and Stef? Is it the sex? Or is it the relationship? Did he ever cheated? It probably will. And did you tell him yours? I had it done so, we had long been separated. Say... Timur, that actually circumcised? Yes. Day, clean guy. Come inside. - Day, Ann. Sarah is a little busy. I am sorry that you are getting a divorce. Not me. Voil. Shall we? Is that really, honey? It's almost starting. Hey, you really do not eat them. Come on. You're too late, girl. - Yes. This is Timur. Pleasant, madam. Pleasant, sir. Tell him Guido. Timur... That's an uncommon name, eh? Oh yeah? Yes, I think so... Yes. I 'm never heard. Will your parents perhaps... From? Especially from Morocco? No, they come from Turkey. - From Turkey. Did she also classical music or is that more folk? Then for a Timur been very unusual concert. Sorry Sarah, I still 'S slaughtering sheep in my bathtub. What are you wearing? Thanks for the coffee. Your mother looked at me I'm like a piece of shit. Well not exaggerate. She does not feel at ease if people do not know. She does not feel at ease because I am a Turk. Too. But what do you want? The only Turks who she knows, are the pita stall. You could tell I'm not Belgian. Sometimes you just the bush fall. No, you do not. So imagine me not to your family. How? Tell? How would you me proposals to your family? That has nothing to do with it. No, it has everything to do with it. I try it anyway. But you... How long do you remember me hidden? Are you ashamed of me? That's it, huh? Okay, that's it. I just do not you dare to imagine. Good enough to fuck, but not fucking in the family to sit Telhan. I would like to know why you are so unfriendly did against Timur, Mom. Guido, what the hell are we doing now wrong? I do not know anymore. Why did not you tell that Timur was a Turk? For me it does not matter, daddy. - Okay, but that's not the point. For me. Telhan sir? Ediz Telhan? Good day. Come with me. Hello? - Hello. Zehra? With mum. So good, girl? - Yeah, Mom. And you? Also good. - Are you coming back? Mommy? Ediz's home? - No, he's just to the pub. Precisely, to the pub. Okay, I will call soon be back, girl. Ediz often goes to the pub? Right, I understand. I'll talk to him. Do not be. It's all going ok if you get back. What a fucking mess, say. - Yeah, sorry. But I understand. I understand it. Cheers. May I ask you something? You already have two good trumpeters. Why have you accepted me? Because you also 're a good trumpet player. And because I like a nice guy. - Well, thank you. That was the good news. The bad news is we are about to stop. With the fanfare? We practice and practice but, but we hardly play. And what happens? Then your players out of here. And why you play so little? A brass band has audience. And what is that audience? That audience, his people from the neighborhood. In 20 years time the become an immigrant neighborhood. And that's not the problem, they are not interested in what we play. And that bleeds death. Excuse me, ma'am. I am looking for Timur. Our Tim. But that is his mother. In Turkey? Such a beautiful country. Never been? That should definitely do again. Yes, that's really worth. We have been in there last summer... in Kusadasi, really beautiful. Such all-in, yes. And the people, that are so... so welcoming, and cheap it is there. Of course, when you buy you have to haggle. That is normal there. We will be back this summer, and to the same hotel. Clean, the food was really good what it was... Timur has also said When he comes back? No, no... I do not know. Sorry. - Thanks. Timur'm his girlfriend? Yes. He has about me? - Yes, handsome couple. You're probably Bora. - Yes. Sarah. You may have heard of me? No, not really. Not really, so a bit. Ah, you are the friend of my brother, Timur. Timur is not here. I know. I really do address his questions in Turkey. Istanbul Kucukkoy. What... Kucukkoy? This is a neighborhood in Istanbul. But I do not know the street name. And is there anyone who knows? - Ediz. Good afternoon. Ediz is here somewhere? Yeah, what does that Ediz what I did? That you need me to explain. No... You're already the second day. He is somewhere working on a Mercedes. Meryem. Meryem, girl. Meryem, the teacher asks you to. To you and Timur. Mother? Sarah? Day, Timur. I go to dad tomb. It's really weird to see you here. - Weird. But... Weird good slash slash or weird bad? Weird dreams I slash. How did you get my address? Ediz. - Ediz. Yes. I caught him while he making love was a blonde. Are you serious? Asshole. What are we looking? - The stars. Which stars? Normally you see here I-knows-how many stars. In Belgium, you see no stars. Yes, you need to see them, eh? Melek... That name on the grave where you at Sat... Who is that? Two years ago I about to get married. Getting married? With your cousin? She's not my cousin, Sarah. Why do you tell them? Why do you say that your cousin, why do you lie to me? A month before the wedding she is killed. Oh, sorry. Let me know if I come back. - When you come back... I have to go to the gate. Look, I come here to see or perhaps we one more chance. But you'm just not ready. You are still a large knot, eh? Thanks. Look out. Timur? Timur, my son? What happened to you? Where have you been? Good thing your father if you do not see. For Sale Do not distress your mother, huh? Bon voyage. Not sad, Meryem. - Here, the keys. You go back to your kids. Not so sad. Bon voyage. Goodbye. Let it hear from you. - Thanks. Do not cry. Call us when you get home. Bon voyage. - Be careful. I have not found what I wanted. What were you then? I do not know. Istanbul has changed a lot. You've changed. Your brothers have changed. You have all changed. Life has changed. Do you love her? Yes, I love her. Bora? - Brother? Mother. What happened to your eye? - I was drunk and I fought. When did you become such a bag? - Since when you cheat Zehra? Brother. Hang're not the acorn from Turkey. - Fuck off. Previously you told me everything. Now I dare you not even in the eyes. You... You wanted me crazy? That's my brother, huh. I've tested. Testing? I'm infertile. Zehra know that? You have to tell her brother. - Why should I? You can not help it. I dare not. I miss Dad. Actually I'm relieved. I was afraid you wanted no children. At least, not with me. Ediz. Timur, my son. In our village in Turkey the winters were severe. Sometimes it snowed all over town. Then it was the family sitting together and there were important things discussed and decisions taken. On such a day hanging in our village Call for workers in Belgium. They had our help. That night I decided a new step: "When the snow melts, I leave for Belgium. "
