I got another tour group in about a half hour, so let's get to tourin'. Come on. Come on. Speed walk. Speed walk. It's good for your soul. That's it. You got it. So, as an economics major, this is where I spend the majority of my time. And thanks to Stratford University's top-notch financial aid program... [Coughs] Bullshit... I spend the rest of my time giving tours, working food services... and delivering campus mail. Now, this package has brought us to the administration building. And here, encased in this glass... No, it's not Superfly's pimp cane. This is the Truman Scepter. This next package will be taking us... to the neuropsychology building. Let's go. Neuropsychology. Let's go. - Let's go. Here you go. Hold that for me. Thanks, baby. - [Claps] Hey, we're gonna stop over at the cafeteria and bust a little suds. Girls wash. Guys dry. Whoo! And here we have Stratford University's prizewinning... neuropsychology department. Oh, I just wanted to thank you all for helping me out with my campus maintenance duties. I think it's a beautiful thing. But remember, plastic goes in the blue, paper in the green. Be back in a jiff. Whoo! Hello? Dr. Wheedon? Got a package for you. Um, right there's fine. Thank you. Wow. That little fellow glows in the dark, huh? I wish the ones at my mom's house would glow in the dark. Um... Thank you. There's a building, building, building. That building's old. That building got windows. And here we are, back at Albert Lovett Library. And that, my friends, is the end of your tour. And the beginning of yours. Welcome. [Man] Gaining 13 and three quarters, utilities up about a fifth of a point. - And the big-board composite up.6 and 45236. - [Phone Rings] - There were over 115 million shares traded on the big board. - [Sighs] - Yeah. - [Woman On Phone] Hi. Darryl? Hey, Ma. How you doin'? Oh, same old, same old. Blase, blase. The kids are drivin' me crazy, stove don't work and the roaches are gettin' attitude. So, when do you start your new job on Wall Street? Well, I don't exactly have the job. There's a lot of competition for that Smythe-Bates job. My oldest son is gonna starve. - I'm not going to starve. - How are you gonna pay your tuition? Ma, I'll just get another job, okay? [Sighs] Well, you know, I didn't want to say anything, but they threatened to turn off the gas. Just send me the bill. How much is it? - $223. - Damn, what you cookin'? Well, baby, we got to eat. And you know I like to cook everything down nice and slow. - You know. - Uh, just send it, Ma. I didn't wanna tell you this, but, uh, you know I'm front-runner for that Smythe-Bates job. I'm so proud of you. And the job pays $60,000 a year. - Oh, baby. - So, you, Darius, Lyndell, Brandon and April... Y'all don't have to worry. - I love you, Darryl. - [Makes Kissing Noise] [Receiver Clicking Off] - [Sighs] - [Phone Rings] [Old Woman Voice] Hello? [Woman] This is the Stratford University tuition office. May I speak to Darryl Witherspoon? Uh, no, uh, Darryl's not with us anymore. He, uh, he die. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - [Tearfully] Yeah, th-they killed my baby. He got involved with that whole East Coast/West Coast thing, and being that he is from Chicago, they both banged on him. Hi. Darryl Witherspoon. [Groaning] [Mumbling] Sammy Davis, Jr. Jr. [Groaning] Lza Kill D. Wipe. Thank you. [Moaning] I am Ishmael Achmel Mohammed Hach-tooey... [Spits] [Gasps] Ooh! Have you donated sperm before? - Yeah. - Uh-huh. And you're familiar with the procedure? Well, I've been doing it since I was 12. The payment procedure. Fifty dollars upon procurement of the sperm. Cool. Um, do you have any of those procurement aids? Oh, certainly. Dirty, Beaver Hunt, Big Butt. - Damn! - Bondage Cheerleaders. - [Bell Rings] - [Man Moaning] Ooh, four. I'm good for one more. Just give me somethin' really freaky. - Like some Siamese midget twins menaging a goat or somethin'. - Okay. Ah, what's up? What's happenin', my man? - Hey. - Got some more hair for you. Hey, look man, I can't do nothin' with them naps. You're back too soon. - Come on, man. I need this money, man. - I can't help you. Please. Come on, man. Hey, brother, look. I got some real good hair for you, man. - Look at the bush. - Hey, look. - It ain't that kind of party, man, hey. - Come on. Look, brother. - I'll throw in the ass hair for free. - Step! Oh, hey, dog. Landlord came by again, looking for your part of the rent. - God, it must be nice having a... - A hockey scholarship? Look, I'm not in the guilt game, all right? My heart is light. - What's with the X? - That's, uh... That's a symbol of my pledge. See, I'm denying myself certain pleasures, eh? Eating meat. Drinking alcohol. Sex. - Sex? - Yeah, all forms of sex. Consider this. Without pain and deprivation, one can never experience true pleasure. You know, this is just like when you converted to Buddhism freshman year. Uh-huh? Then you went premed, then Republican and then the Tony Robbins tapes. And let's not forget your little bisexual stage. Well, that just lasted two hours. Well, two and a half. You try watchin' Brad Pitt in Interview With A Vampire and not feel a little conflicted. Look, man, all I'm sayin'... pick an obsession, stay with it. - All right? - Mmm. - [Metal Jangling] - Okay, what's the new chiming sound? Oh, uh, that's my Prince Albert. - A what? - Yeah, I got a piercing through my urethra. And I run a chain from that to my scrotum. - Listen. - [Ringing] Ohh. With piercing, uh, it's about pain and pleasure. Like you, for instance, right? You got that inner pain, that hunger for success. And when you get it, it's gonna be all the more sweet, dog. [Chattering] Hello, Darryl. Runnin' low on bacon bits over here. - Hi, Scott. - No emergency. Just somethin' to keep in the back of your head. Oh, well, thank you for the pork report. Appreciate it. - You going up for that Smythe-Bates job? - Oh, yeah. I'm kind of the pace car in this Employment 500. 3.8 G.P.A. Varsity sailing. Kappa House social chairman. Your dad runs the third-largest bank in Manhattan. Oh, yeah, and that. Right. Ahh-Ahh-Ahh Ahh-Ahh-Ahh - Ahh-Ahh-Ahh - Ooh, lookie, lookie, Darryl sees a cookie. - Ahh-Ahh-Ahh - Is that Hidden Valley? Or are you just happy to see me? - Ahh-Ahh-Ahh - [Chuckles] - Ahh-Ahh-Ahh - Uh, ah, da... [Man Narrating] Smythe-Bates has long enjoyed a reputation... as one of the world's premier investment firms. That is why each year we choose our new junior analysts with tremendous care. The Smythe-Bates man or woman has a high G.P.A., a record of athletic achievement and ties of tradition to our firm through some... of the more prominent fraternal organizations on campus. Because we regard the junior analyst position not as a stopping point, but as a stepping stone to greatness. [Video Clicks Off] Now, class, I would like for you to extend a very warm welcome to my old friend, Mr. Randall Tyson of Smythe-Bates Brokers. - Randall? - Thank you, Professor Engel. Good to see you. Uh, well, this old room holds many memories for me. - I logged quite a bit of nap time in that back row. - [Darryl Laughs Loudly] I sincerely wish that we had a place for all of you, but that's not the case. Five of you will be chosen, and out of the five finalists, the student who most closely resembles the ideal employee... will be chosen for the position of junior analyst at Smythe-Bates. Good luck to all of you. All right, class, in the case study that we were examining last week... Now, the markets are up, but consumer spending... and corporate profit margins are down. - Now, how would the social planner remedy this, huh? - [Darryl] Ooh! - [Boy] Sir? - Downsize the labor force. - What? - This increases profit, and the resulting price cuts... stimulate consumer spending. - Yo, difference of opinion here. - Uh, Mr. Witherspoon... and we can do without the yo-ing... What he's sayin' is let's help people by firing them. Now, this seems to me, ebonically speaking, whack. Perhaps Darryl does have a special insight into the blue collar, or, should I say, hairnet mentality. Oh! [Laughs] Look... Wicks Morton Industrials, okay? In 1988, their wages exceeded their profit margins, but instead of firing people, what they did was they offered employee contracts with wage givebacks. And guess what. Their employees spent 50 percent more than they did the previous year. Now, what that proves is what the average Joe on the street already knows. The more money they have, the more money they can spend. He's absolutely right. Wicks Morton did do the right thing by their employees. But then again, instead of laying off workers, they took out a $20 million loan... from a certain bank here in Manhattan, and from what I hear, - From your dad? - They're on the verge of defaulting. So what happens to your average workin' Joe when Wicks Morton goes down? I don't think they're gonna end up in the checkout line. I think it's gonna be the unemployment line. And the president of the company is gonna be right there with them. Ebonically speaking, you don't know shit. Dare I say, you're out of your league. Darryl, although carrying water is technically an aerobic activity, - it does not qualify you to play college-level hockey. - [Sticks Clattering] Coach, please. Look, I need this time. Please, Coach. Look, I'm just a brother from the hood with a simple dream to play hockey. Don't make me turn to drugs or gangs... - [Grunting] - LaFlour! - He's on your team. - Just following through, Coach! - Yeah. Sure, Tim. - [Grunts] - Hey, Tim. When was the last time you had sex? - Why? - You're just a little jumpy, that's all. - [Neck Cracking] - Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you please talk to the coach and try and get me some time on the ice? I need a sport, or I'm not gonna get the Smythe-Bates job. Please. I need it for my family, man. Right, yeah, I'll talk to Coach for ya, eh? Thanks, Tim. Uh, these things are too tight! [Grunts] [Player #1] Nice shot! [Player #2] The outside! [Buzzer Rings] - Come on. Come on. - [Blows Whistle] [High-Pitched Scream, Grunts] Wait. Wait. [Continues Screaming, Grunting] - [Blows Whistle] - [Darryl Screaming] - [Blows Whistle] - [Darryl] Uh, wait! Uh, oh... Oh, my ass! [Grunts] [Screaming Continues] Wait. My sack, my sack, my sack! [Tim] Hip-Hup-Zip-Hup! Freshmen. - Hey, what's up? I got somethin' to show you, eh! - I don't wanna see it. No, no, no. You know how I always lose my apartment key, right? I always lose it. But look... look wh... It's new. I call it my key to happiness. Oh, my God. You know what you are? You're a freak show. - [Laughs] - Hey, the landlord called again. I'm worried about you, right? Don't worry about it, dog. I'll get the rent. Hey, it's all good, dog. Listen, you may not have faith in fate. But, my man, fate has faith in you. Welcome. You are here to participate in the first round of human testing... of Protocol 563. You'll be the first people to take this drug. Federal regulations require me to list all possible side effects of this experiment. Please listen carefully. This drug has not been shown to be toxic in rats... and should be similarly nontoxic in human beings, theoretically. Potential side effects may include nausea, insomnia, headaches, flaking of the scalp, intestinal cramping, constipation, rectal burning, rectal itching, rectal swelling... and dizziness. - Sir? - [Snoring] Yes. - Did you hear me? - Yeah. Rectal itchin'. No problem. - And you are willing to participate? - It's paying, right? [Squeaking] This is a model of the drug we've created here. It is designed to increase the senses... far beyond levels ever experienced by a human being before. Are you following this? Yeah. What are you sayin'? I'll be able to see better? - Like an eagle. - How 'bout my hearin'? - Ultrasonic. - Taste, smell and feelin' too? The five senses will be magnified ten times over. Wow. Supersenses. This is the drug. How you take it is of the utmost importance. You must take exactly six cc's every single day. And you must inject it into the buttocks. - These are your instructions. - How much do I get paid? You must also take it when your serotonin levels are at their lowest, just before you go to bed. How much do I get paid? If and when your senses become heightened, the initial phase will be disorienting and disturbing. [Inhaling Sharply] Deep breathing may help. - Are there any questions? - How much do I get paid? Um, well, since you're the only person, after the experiment's over, you get $3,000. $3,000? - Whoo! $3,000. - [Clears Throat] Doctor, look, for $3,000... you can inject me with the Ebola virus, okay? $3,000. Doctor, for $3,000, I'm gonna be your little Outbreak monkey, okay? Hey what's with all the bongs and the booze? Going to a party at Rick James' house? No, just doin' a little winter cleaning, purifying the apartment, eh? Oh, that sounds fine. Me, I'm gonna go in there, eat a little pig, smoke a little crack, masturbate a little bit. - Care to join me? - No, all I'm doing tonight is soaking... little limp Timmy in some rubbing alcohol. - Oh. - Turns out the Prince Albert was a bad idea. Yeah, I could've told you that one. Hey, dude, I wanted to thank you, man. I got a little bit of time on the ice. I think my game is improving. Uh, about that, the thing is... I've been practicing how to say this all night, dog... 'Cause the thing is, the last thing I would want to do is hurt your feelings, right? - You got your key? - Oh. 'Cause sometimes, you know, sometimes when it comes to hockey, sometimes people suck. Look, I don't care, okay? The only reason I'm playing hockey or doin' this stupid frat... is to get the Smythe-Bates job. Oh, I know that. But to suck at hockey the way you suck, you know, suck the way that fat kids or old people might suck... I mean, you suck. Hey! I mean, you really suck. I mean, it's like, you know, you get on the ice and you're horrifying. - You just watch. You're like a hoser on there... - Would you give me that? - [Rips] - [Screams, Whimpers] I'm sorry. Do you wanna freak Do you wanna freak Do you wanna freak - Do you wanna freak - Damn. Mmm. - [People Cheering] - I'm gonna freak it for ya - I'm gonna freak - Ooh, what's up, baby? Do you wanna freak - Do you wanna freak - [Gasping] [Bystander] Oh, man! Ooh, you like that? You wanna see some more of this later? Whoo! Hey, hey, you got pull around here, right? Hey, why don't you pledge me? I wanna be a Kappa. Come on, man. Pledge me. Look, you can beat me, spank me. Look, you could brand the inside of my crack. Please. Excuse me? Oh, no. I was just, um... I'm... Hi. You're high. Well, that would explain it. No, I'm not high as in, you know, [Snorts] high. I mean "hi" as in "hello." How are you? Hi. Darryl. Hey, I was wondering if maybe, you know, me and you could... Let me guess. Maybe we could get together a little later. Get to know each other a little better... over a glass of something with alcohol in it, right? If you don't drink, we could have a Yoo Hoo or somethin'. Janice. - Could I call you? - Maybe. - Witherspoon. - Hey, Scott. - Rushing as a senior, huh? - Hey, just trying to join a frat, man. - Right on. Have a seat. - Cool. By the way, it's "fraternity," not "frat." You wouldn't call your country a... Hey, whoa. Not since the Bush years. You know what I'm sayin'? - Ooh. - I know why you're here, buddy. You see what you want and you go after it, and I like that. But we're not here for you to put on your resume so you can get the Smythe-Bates job. Oh, I get it. You're here so you can put it on your resume. - You know what I'm sayin', brother? - Darryl, you little table turner. The truth is, you're too good for us here, man. You're too cool. We're a bunch of nerds. You wouldn't fit in. Like Stan here. He's captain of the wrestling team. He wins all the time. He's a bore. Or Thomas, class president. What's up, baby? Still can't get a hang of the whole "bad means good" thing. Doesn't make sense to him. Bottom line is, you're an MTV video. Everybody say, "Hey, ho." And we're VH1 on James Taylor weekend. We're a bunch of phonies, Darryl, but you're keepin' it real. Don't let us ruin that. - Scott. Come on, man. - You're just not Kappa material. But, Scott, I'm sayin'... But thanks for tryin'. - [Whistling] - [Onlookers Laughing] [Continues Whistling] - Bye-bye. - [Mocking Tone] Darryl. [Together] Darryl. Darryl. [Laughter Resumes] [Chattering] [Children Yelling] Can't get no worse than this. [Girl] Okay, thanks. This exam counts very heavily toward your midterm grade. So if you are going for that Smythe-Bates job, I suggest you take it very seriously. [Sniffing] [Continues Sniffing] Excuse me. Somebody isn't zestfully clean this morning. Screw you. I'm clean. [Continues Sniffing] Ooh. [Cacophonous Bang] - [Professor, Voice Amplified] All right, people. - Aah. You have one hour to complete this examination. And you may begin now. [Pencil Screeching Loudly] Aah. Ohh. [Amplified Ticking] [Loud Clucking] [Squeak, Sucking Noise, Swooshing] [Grunting] [Obnoxious Squeaking] - [All Sounds Coming Together] - [Grunting] [Gasping] Hey, Darryl, why don't you pull over to the nervous breakdown lane? [Wheezing] - [Coughing, Sniffing] - [Yawning] [Coughing] Hey, Queasy Jefferson, bring it down a notch. [Coughing Continues] - [Loud Chewing] - [Concussive Pounding] - [Excessive Squeaking] - [Discordant Scraping] - [Gagging Noise] - [Banging Like Basketball] [Neck Cracking] [Whimpering, Gasping] - Will you all just cut this shit! - [Girl] Oh, my God! Oh, my God. - [All Whispering] - You! You better fix that damn watch. And you, rich girl. We know you got money. Put that damn diamond away. And, eh, British guy, if you gonna live in this country, you'd better go see a damn dentist about that stink-ass breath. You smell like hot garbage! Now, please, I'm tryin' to take a test here! This is my future! Mr. Witherspoon, sit down! And one more outburst from you, and you are out of my classroom! Oh, I'm sorry, professor. That was my Tourette's syndrome. Piss on me, I'm on fire! I just... I just can't help it. Michael Jackson's a Puerto Rican! [Squealing] O.J.'s on welfare. I seen him on the line. I just can't help it. You look like Bob Hope. [Mumbling] Dennis Rodman got a coochie! I just really can't help it. I can't. I failed my test. My dream is gone. And this itching is tearin' my ass, and it keeps gettin' worse and worse. - You did this to me. - Darryl, calm down. Calm down. - Sit down. Come on. - [Gasping] Get off. - Sit down. - [Grunting] - Excuse me. - Now. - Oh, Mama. Ahh. - Follow the light with your eyes. Okay. [Screams] What are you tryin' to do, blind me? Oh, my God, I wanna kill you so bad. [Groans] [Grunts] - [Continues Grunting, Groaning] - [Muttering] This is excellent. Excellent? No, Doctor, this is not excellent. This is an outrage. I'm gonna sue your ass. I'm gonna sue you. Darryl, you are experiencing advanced rectal irritation. But the pain will pass as your neural pathways adjust. Doc, you got nice nails. Can you scratch this for me, please? Right there. Ahh. - Oh, yeah. - To gain control... over your senses, you have to exercise them. Your brain is trying to cope with heightened human perception. - You have to help that process. - Mm-hmm. - Concentrate. - [Groaning] Focus, and you will gain control over your supersenses. Ow! God. Oh, spread it. Ohh! [Panting] Hey, Doctor, can I borrow these? Thank you. Ahh. Oh, yeah. Ooh! Ahh. - [Ripping Sound] - [Screams, Grunts] [Darryl] What's the matter? Uh... I got a snag. - [Jangling] - [Grunts] Yeah. Yeah. - You are weird. - I'm weird? Look at you. Are you all right? - Oh, I'm just not feeling well. - That's too bad. I'm going over to the hockey rink. Ah, I gave up on hockey. - It's stupid. - You gave up? I heard back from Smythe-Bates today. [Sighs, Muffled] I'm not even a finalist. - Not a what? - I'm not a finalist. Well, you don't want to be hanging out with those Wall Street losers anyway. [Sighs] What am I gonna tell my mom? Oh, dog. I'm sorry. [Car Horns Honking, Traffic Sounds] Aah. - [Panting] Focus, concentrate. - [Horns Honking] - Find the control. - [Tires Screeching Loudly] [Wings Fluttering Loudly] [Breathing Deeply] [Baby Crying At Normal Volume] Oh, my God. [Bell Tolling] Normal. Super. Normal. - Super. - [Footfalls Amplified] Damn. [Making Smooching Noises] [Glass Clinking] Stratford University would like to welcome our five excellent finalists, their families and the distinguished executives... of the Smythe-Bates company to this very special banquet. [All Together] Hear, hear. [Man #1] You look so sexy in that bow tie. [Man #2] Do you want to come on over after? - Oh, that'd be great. I just wanna lick you up and down. - Shh. I'm gonna tie you to the bed post... and beat the shit out of you with my black leather whip. Hey, Darryl, you eat this kind of crap, right? - Yeah. - Okay, tell me if it's sweet enough. Mmm. Mmm, good. Mmm. Mmm. Where you get this from? This is the best thing I ever tasted. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. God. Mmm. Delicious! Wait, wait. Your button's all messed up! - You're always looking out for me. - Ooh. - Eh, what table you got? - The dais. Well, now you got table four and six. Thank you. Now I have to toss more salads. Good evenin', Mr. Tyson and student. - Economics. - Darryl Witherspoon. How are you, sir? - This is Robert Bellweather. - Hey, Mr. Bellweather. Nice to meet you. - Pleasure. - [Mr. Bellweather] Hello, Darryl. - I will be your server this evening. - Good. Yippee. You're an impressive candidate, Mr. Thorpe, and I'm curious... to hear about your opinions on the current state of the market. Certainly. I, uh... Uh, Darryl, is it... Can you be a buddy and go fill that with somethin'? [Whistles] [Tyson] What's your opinion of Shamada Technology, Scott? - Shamada. - Shamada. [Scott] Oh, uh, Shamada Tech. Right. They... - That's a good question. They're, um... - Here you are, Mr. Tyson. An extra salad for you. Just keep it on the download, okay? - That's very generous, but I've got plenty. - Mr... Mr. Tyson, please, it's the least I can do... for the man who's buyin' up Deauville Publishin', settin' the trend for LBO's. I mean, Mr. Tyson, you a genius. Thank you. No, Mr. Tyson, thank you. Do you realize that all these other companies follow your lead? Let's take Shamada, for example. They're gonna drop precipitously in the fourth quarter. Well, that's very odd. We were just talking about that. Get the... [Grunts] Out of here! You know about this? How? Mr. Tyson, economics is my life. Actually, I read in the papers, there's this Japanese firm coming out with this new chip. It's supposed to be twice as fast and twice as cheap. And with the debt that Shamada's carrying from that last buyout, I don't think they're gonna make it. If I was you guys, I'd sell and sell fast. - I already have. - You did? You see, and that is why this man is a genius. - You a genius. - Hey, uh, waiter, could I get some wine, please? - Sure, my little friend. What would you like? - Who cares? Just go. - Night Train it is. - Uh, Darryl, some butter without salt. That's a very bright young man. [Plates Crashing] Butter. Butter, butter, butter. Hey, where'd you guys hide the butter? Whoo! Yes, it's so nice. It really seems wonderful. [Darryl] Go ahead. Name a stock. Okay, I got one. Haskell Growth Fund. Haskell Growth Fund. 341/8. Am I right? Come on. Am I right? Come on. Give it up. Give it up. 146 flat, down from a high of 180. - Ha-ha! - Ha-ha! Fielding Industrials. Fielding Industrials. Uh, you know, I'm just gonna throw this one out there. You know, I'm just gonna... just throw it out there. - [Gasps] - Fifty-five. - And a half. - That's it. Huh? Huh? The kid is nice, huh? - How'd you memorize all this? - It's kind of like your wife's bra size. If you love it, you'll remember, huh, tiger? Come on. Come on, Mr. Tyson. What's your wife's bra size? - Thirty-six. - Thirty-six what? - C. - Thirty-six C! Well, young man, I haven't had such an informative meal in some time. - I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. - How did you fail to qualify for the final competition? You know, I've been workin' four jobs just to pay my tuition, and, uh, I don't know, I just blew my final exam. Why should such a hard worker be punished? - You know, I feel like bending the rules here. - Too bad there's already five. [Tyson] What do you think, Bellweather? He's certainly qualified for the competition. Good. Congratulations, Darryl. You are now the sixth finalist. Mr. Tyson, thank you, sir. Thank you so much. And thank you, Mr. Bellweather. Thank you, sir. I-I promise you, you will not regret this. For your sake, I'd better not. But, uh, Mr. Tyson, uh... Yes! F-D-P-L-T-C-L. Okay, other eye, bottom line. The Hilsinger Company, Plainville, Massachusetts, 02762, printed in the U.S.A. Over in the corner is a fingerprint. Right there. It looks like a smudge of jelly... strawberry. It's the no-frills brand. Somethin' real cheap. Your five senses are operating at levels... no human being has ever experienced. - We have a lot of tests to do. - Wait, wait, wait. No, Doc. We can't do tests today. I'm late. Just hook me up with my drugs, and let me be on my way. Just remember, follow the regimen exactly. - Do not exceed the dosage. - Okay. Oh, Doc, uh, I wanted to apologize 'cause, you know, I came down really hard on you the other day. It's just that this drug, man, it's the best thing that ever happened to me. I mean, I feel like for the first time in my life, I'm on top of the world. Darryl, I realize that you feel very powerful right now. Just remember, power is a drug all its own. Be careful. Okay. Oh, yeah. And, Doc... [Grunts] Thank you. Whoo! Hey, it's the little engine that could. - Hey, what's up, Scott? - This party's invite only. No invitee, so good nighty. Oh, what's the matter, Scott? You feel that Smythe-Bates job slippin' through your fingers? - Huh? [Laughs] - Dude, your last name could be Smythe-Bates, and you still wouldn't get this job, 'cause it's mine. - Darryl! - Hey, how you doin', Mr. Bellweather? How are you? Mr. Tyson. - Hey, didn't know you were a Kappa. - Actually, I'm not. Darryl's the one that got away. Now, if you'll excuse us. Well, I think he's the sort of Kappa man we should be pledging. - Absolutely. I agree. - Well, uh, Darryl's case... has already been decided, I'm sorry to say. Scott, uh, we sit on the board of this fraternity, and we endow it as well. I think we've earned some input, don't you? - Hear, hear. - Brothers, listen up! Brother Bob Bellweather and I would like you... to reconsider the pledgeship of Darryl Witherspoon. All in favor of Darryl say "aye." - [All Together] Aye. - [Tyson] All opposed? The ayes have it, Pledge Witherspoon! Thanks, Scott. - [Loud Slap] - [Grunts, Chuckles] Welcome aboard. [Woman Laughs] Ooh, baby's got back. Oh, my God, Tanya, I can't believe you said that. [Laughs] [Janice] This place is so packed. - I don't know why you drag me to these parties. - Girl, you come to meet a man. - [Knocking] - Anybody in this stall? The problem, Tanya, is that the kind of guy I wanna meet is never here. - Oh, and what kind of guy is that? - I don't know. - Ooh, this seat is cold! - Respectful, intelligent, confident without being full of himself. Ooh, I tell ya. I'm full of somethin' right about now. [Laughs, Breaks Wind] - [Sniffs] Damn. - It's like everybody wants to be the big man on campus. - [Groaning] - But nobody wants to be the real man on campus. [Tanya Groaning] Oh. [Groaning, Flatulence Continue] [Choking] Goddamn, girl, you smell like somethin' crawled up in you and died. - Not you. - I'm beginning to feel having standards is a curse. - [Tanya Breaks Wind] - Damn. What did you eat? Corn? I don't remember eatin' no corn! Oh! Ech! Ach! [Coughing] - Are you okay in there? - Girl, I feel like I just gave birth. - [Toilet Flushing] - Somebody smack its ass! [Laughing] - Darryl. - Hey. I'm surprised to see you here. Encore performance in the lion's den. - I'm impressed. - Well, thank you. - [Clears Throat] - Oh, Darryl, this is my friend Tanya. - Hey. - Hey. [Speaks Mock Foreign Language] Chaka Khan. Well, Janice, I'm gonna leave you and your friend alone so y'all can get better acquainted. You're not here for me, are you? 'Cause I'm not worth the humiliation these guys are gonna... - Is that a pledge pin? - Yes. - Where'd you get that? - Girl, I earned it. Look, when you want something, you gotta be persistent in your passions. Damn, you smell good as hell. Is that a little bit of oak... [Sniffs] Some flowers, a little bit of vanilla? Wow, that's exactly right. Anyway, I should be going. Hey, I'll walk you home. - Good night. - Good night. - [Biker] Whoa, comin' through. - Hey, watch yourself. So? [Laughs] I really don't give a damn about them fraternities, you know? I'm just doin' it 'cause it's a means to an end. I'm just tryin' to get this job and help my family out. See, I've always been like a father... to my little sister and my brothers. Well, my father's pushing me to take pre-law classes, but what I really love is my 20th century poets course. Hey, you know what. I think my boy Tim is in your class. White guy. Lanky. Tall. Piercings. - Ah, the pincushion kid. - Yeah. [Sniffing] What? Where are we going? Darryl, what are you doing? - [Gasps] - Sometimes you find the most amazing thing... in the most unexpected places. - [Darryl] What? - [Janice] I'm just trying to decide... whether I should break my "no kissing on the first date" rule. - Oh, so this was a date? - No. - Oh. - Just planning ahead. That's good. Hey, don't worry. I don't want you to think that I'm just tryin' to get into your panties. I mean, I'm pretty sure they're really nice panties, but I just wanna take it a little slow. How 'bout dinner at my place? I'll call you. - I'll answer. - Okay. [Exhales] - Ooh! - Say, Jack! What wrong with you? Junkie gun. Darryl, no. - Hey. - Hey. I was, uh, just in there taking some special medicine. - Yeah. It's all yours. - Thanks. - Good night. - Good night, eh? [Darryl] Yo, Coach! Coach! - Witherspoon, what are you doin' in pads? - I've been practicing. - When did you learn to skate like that? - Uh, I watch Ice Capades videos. But please, Coach, let me go out there on the ice and show you what I can do. Please? Just give me one good reason why I should? Holy mother of crap. [Kung Fu Yell] Ooh! Ya-Ya! Come with it. Whoo! - [Whistle Blows] - [Players Shouting] [Yelling] [Continues Kung Fu Yell] [Yelling Together] [Crowd Cheering] This is Stratford University radio coming to you live... from Baxter Rink, where the Panthers are set... to open their season against Brownstone U. That's right, Chet, and the only questions this year are... how badly will they stink, how consistently will they stink... and will they ever not stink? Whoo! Whoo! That's the new stopper, Darryl Witherspoon, who's the first... African American to play for Stratford. ["Fanfare"] [Blows Whistle] [Chet] Bender takes a face-off, passes over to Avery. - Avery back to Bender. - [Grunts] - Stay down! - Ooh, Flushing checked by LaFlour! - What got into him? - Stratford recovers now. Pass ahead to LaFlour on the floor now, chases it down behind the net. Ooh, Brownstone regains control as... Oh, Chet! They're really bringin' on the pain tonight. And here comes Bender. Bender over to Avery. Avery back to Bender. Shot! Save! Oh, what a stop by the newcomer, uh, Darryl... Wither... spoon. All right. Bender now kicks it off. Speeding down center ice. Shot. And the glove save! Hard to believe anybody could've stopped that shot, let alone someone on our team. And the Panthers now charge back. Up ahead to LaFlour. LaFlour smoothing down center ice. Shot! Score! And Stratford takes the lead for the first time in my life! - [Whistle Blows] - And LaFlour wins the face-off for the Panthers. And with just two minutes left in the game, Stratford still has a one-point lead. And rookie Darryl Witherspoon is just this close to a shutout. Ooh, nasty check! Brownstone regains control. Pass to Bender, who shoots! Save, Witherspoon! Everyone's gonna be asking the same question, Chet. Where'd this kid come from, and who the hell is he? Ten seconds now left in the game, and here comes trouble. Bender over to Avery. They've drawn out Witherspoon. The net is wide open. - Avery to Bender. Shot! - [Yells] - Save! - Stratford wins! Stratford wins! I don't believe it! Go, baby! Whoo! - [Laughs] - I love that kid. The Panthers are back, and, baby, they're black! [All Cheering] [Tyson] What do you think of this possible Irving Genetic Wilcom merger, Scott? [Scott] Well, uh, Irving stock just hit a five-year high, so I'd say the outlook's pretty rosy. Scott, you're a very impressive young man. Very impressive, indeed. - Hello, Darryl. - Hi, how you doin', Mr. Tyson? Darryl, I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but Mr. Tyson... and I were just interfacing about some things. Oh, really. You wouldn't happen to be interfacing... about the Irving Genetics merger, would you? - Yes, we were. - Well, I hope you mentioned that the CEO of that company... is known for bluffing to drive up his stock prices right before he sells his own shares. - Yes, I did. - No, you didn't. Come on, Darryl. Thank you, Scott. Oopsy. Sir, I realize that I'm last on your list, but I want you to know I would do absolutely anything to get this junior analyst position. It's gonna take a lot to convince that board of mine... to pick you over the other five candidates. You know, playing hockey and becoming a Kappa, that helps, but now they have such high expectations. - You think you can match that? - Match and exceed. The board's gonna make its decision five days after the final competition. Bob Bellweather wants to spend some quality time with each of the candidates. So, here you go. Floor seats, Knicks game, Friday night. - Floor seats? - [Chuckles] Oh, wow. We'll be joined by Arlo Vickers. - From Vickers Mining? - That's right. He's considering becoming a client. Now, if you can impress him as much as you've impressed us, that would help quite a bit. Sir, say no more. No problem. Not another word, babe Oh, that may have been the best meal I've ever had. - Well, thank you. - Where'd you learn to cook like that? Oh, I've just been experimentin' a little lately. See, cooking, it's all about balancing your taste and smell and texture. It's magic. Is there anything you can't do? Take my eyes off you. Why no one wants to be in love anymore Don't know what you feel or think, baby You can overlook the doubting And trying to be perfect [Sports Announcer Calling Game] "Love is a ripe plum growing on a purple tree." "Love is a ripe plum growing on a purple tree." [Tim] "Taste it once, and the spell of its enchantment will never let you be." "Taste it once, and the spell of its enchantment will never let you be." Langston Hughes. You know Langston Hughes? Yeah, I know Langston Hughes. "Love is a bright star glowing in the far southern skies." "Love is a bright star glowing in the far southern skies." "Look too hard, and its burning flame will always hurt your eyes." [Darryl] "Look too hard, and its burning flame... will always hurt your eyes." "These feelings of love, truth be told, - [Sportscaster Calls Game] - All I want is..." "All I want is to..." [Scott] Score! Score! [Intense Panting, Moaning] [Panting Intensifies] Oh. Oh, God. Uh. No touch... No touching. [Sighing] Whoo! You the best. You've got to be kidding. Excuse me, how much will I get for filling this? Oh, um, ooh... [Laughs] [Man Chattering On TV] Hey. Ha-Ha. - [Kids Shouting] - What a surprise. Hey, relax, I just saw you last week. Everybody, hi. This is Janice. [Kids Together] Hi! - This is April, my beautiful little sister. - Hi. - And this is my little man, Darius. - Hi. And that's Brandon. And this right here is... Hello there, my beautiful sister. Hey, man. Watch out. This one's mine. You better watch your back. [Kisses] Let me get a good look at my Darryl's girl. Oh, you are a pretty thing. - [Brandon Laughing] - Hey, come here. - Hey, hey. You been smokin' cigarettes? - Uh-uh. Don't lie to me. Yes. [Sniffs] Yes, you have. Menthol. Let me tell you something. If I catch you smokin' cigarettes, I'm gonna put somethin' on you, you understand me? - We good? All right. - Mm-hmm. We good. - Come here. - Oh, man. Uh-huh. Go on. Now we good. So, Janice, were you in the gifted class? - Oh, we had a program at sc... - 'Cause you know my Darryl needs a gifted woman. After all, he was the smartest child in his high school class. Except for that Korean girl. What was her name, Darryl? Fat Crack Ho, or somethin' like that. Hey. About in the hall, I heard Mom talking with your teachers on the phone. - You messing up in school again? - No. I didn't do nothin'. Where'd you hear that from? I got magic ears like a superhero, see? - Yeah, right. - Hey, look. I make you a deal. I'll give you a quarter for every "A" you get. - A quarter? - Okay, all right. A dollar. Man, you're an economics major. Ain't you heard of inflation? - Hey, Ma. Here. - Uh-uh, honey. Take it. You need it more than I do. Thank you, Darryl. Normally I wouldn't take this. When I get this job, gonna be a whole lot more where that came from. You know, Janice, whenever I get angry about their daddy leaving, I just remember what he left behind. - [Door Opens] - What's up, dude? [Metal Jangling] Hello, baby. [Clicks Tongue] [Unzipping] - [Straining] - [Spraying Sound] Aah! [Door Opens] Hey. - Taking more medicine? - Yep. How's that goin', eh? Dude, it's going great. It's like the best thing that ever happened to me. Ever since I started taking this medicine, I feel so focused. I mean, things are absolutely great between me and Janice; I'm this close to getting into a frat; I'm a shoo-in for the Smythe-Bates job... - You're playing like an all-star hockey goalie, huh? - It's the medicine! You act like you're invincible. That medicine doesn't make you a different person. - You're still the same old Darryl. - Yeah? Well, tomorrow, I'm gonna be the same old Darryl... times two. A double dose won't kill me. [Exhaling] [Unzipping] [Ringing] [Ringing Continues] [Ringing Stops] What the hell's wrong with my arm? [Grunts] My arm is asleep. [Grunting] [Groans] [Objects Clattering] [Groans] [Voice Distorted] You didn't... exceed the dosage, did you? What? Exceed the... Come on, Doctor. What am I, stupid? Yes, I did. Darryl, what were you thinking? I don't know. I have to generate all new data. To hell with your data. What is my problem? A flood of serotonin... has desensitized your receptors. - The neural plasticity... - [Amplified Whooshing] [Voice Echoing] Of your brain has compensated... by allowing you the use of only four of your given senses at any given time, with the missing one constantly switching. So, if you can see, smell, taste and hear, you can't feel anything. And if you can feel, smell, taste and hear, you can't see. - And if you can see, feel... - Okay, okay! Doc, I get the point. Just tell me, how do you fix it? [Echoing Stops] It's nothing I can fix. The drug just has to... [Voice Echoing] Pass through your system. Trust me. You'll know when it's gone. And how long will that take? Three days. And I suggest you stay in bed. Doc, the next three days are going to decide my life. The Smythe-Bates competition is on Monday. - God, this is like a bad dream. - Darryl. Your condition is... [Voice Echoing] highly unstable. [Voice Fading] With your senses switching on and off... without warning, anything... Doctor, I'm pretty sure what you're saying... would make a whole lot more sense if I could hear you! [Car Horns Honking, People Chattering] [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Madison Square Garden, the home of your New York Knicks. [Darryl] Man, I love the Knicks. You know, when I was little, I used to always watch the game on TV... and I used to always say, "I wonder who all those lucky people are sitting courtside." - Now you're the lucky one, huh? - Thanks to you. - Hey, you the man. - I am.

[Groans] [Car Horns Honking] [Sighs] So, how bad did I do? - Well, Vickers is signing the papers tomorrow. - Vickers is gonna sign? You're gonna get the account? You don't look happy. If it weren't for the fact Arlo Vickers is one-quarter man, three-quarters pig, you'd be gone. I'll see you Sunday at the hockey game. - I expect, for your sake, you'll be at your best? - Yes, sir. - [Flatulence] - [Sniffs] Don't worry about it. I can't smell a thing. Tell me again Be my baby again - Pusher lady. - [Knock At Door] Yeah? - Hey! Uh... - Lorraine. [Door Creaking] [Chains Jangling] I've been watching you around campus, and I like what I've seen. Oh, I ain't mad at you, girl. [Chuckles] Wait. Aren't you Janice's sorority sister? You know Janice, right? My girlfriend Janice? I know her. I thought we'd listen to a little music... [Voice Echoing] and drink a little wine, get to know each other better. You know... [Distorted Speech] I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. I'd like to get out of these clothes... and into... you. - They smack who's 'ho? - [Laughs] Excuse me? Sushi? No, I don't know him. Little brother, I don't know why you're trippin', okay?

[Laughing] - [Clicking] - [Chuckles] Do you like these? Uh... yeah, that's nice. You make 'em yourself? No, silly. I had a doctor do 'em for me. [Chuckles] Wow! - And what a mighty fine physician he was. God! - Go ahead and touch 'em. You know you want to. Don't be afraid. Touch 'em! Ooh! Ooh, you like it rough. - [Moaning] - [Garbled] Oh, God. That's different. Oh, oh, God. Mm. Mm. What's happening? What's the matter, baby? [Garbled] I can't feel my mouth. - Is it asleep? - Yes, my mouth is asleep. Let me wake it up. - You like this, don't you? - Yes. [Muttering] [Gibbering] - [Gibbering Continues] - [Gasping] Oh! No, wait, wait. - This is your first time? - Well, actually, not my first time. My first time, I was about 17... Oh, it's... it's okay. I think you're sexy, and besides, you always remember your first. - [Both Moaning, Sighing] - Oh, God. I can't feel nothing. I can't feel no... - Uh... Th-That... No, that's good. - You feel this, huh? Oh, yeah, that's good. [Giggling] - [Gibbers] - What about this? Oh, yeah. I feel that... [Gibbers, Grunts] Take me. I would love to, but it looks like little homey's asleep. Huh? Oh, no. No. Wake up! Wake up! [Gibbers] He's gonna wake up. He'll wake up. Wake up. Lorraine! No. Hold on! Don't leave! Wake up! Wake... [Screams] - I thought you liked women. - [Groaning] [High-Pitched Voice] I love women. - Good luck. - I love women. Oh, really? Hi, Janice. I'm glad to see you, baby. - [Groaning] - You cheated on me with that piece of trash? [Grunting] Baby, I didn't do anything. I couldn't even get it up. [Screaming] [High-Pitched Moan, Coughing] [Grunting] [Sobs] Ow. Oh, my God! He's OD'd! No, dog! Don't leave us, dog! Don't you go down that tunnel! Let me check his eyes. Damn it! His pupils are dilated. Dude, you gotta turn his head. If he pukes, he's gonna choke on his barf. Just back up, okay? He's gonna shit on himself. This is an epinephrine shot straight to the heart. It's the only way. No, let me do it. I love him. [Screams] Call it an intervention. We were just trying to help you out, Darryl. Help me? Tim, let's say this gets out. People are gonna think I'm a smackhead. The word's "addict." And I think you should respect the problem, eh? - I don't have a problem! - Don't yell at me. I don't have a problem. It was an experimental medicine given to me by the university, and it messed up my senses. That and heroin? - I am not on heroin! - Don't yell at me. I'm not yelling at you. Understand, I'm in a bad state. And you, my friend, you're making it worse, okay? My private life is a mess, and God knows what the hell's happening with my career. And I'm not yelling at you. - [Fizzing] - To get Hell Night started off with a bang. I'd like you little plebes to join me in a putrid bowl of liquid shit. - [All Moaning] - Sounds good. - I'm buying. - Hey. Witherspoon. There's my favorite jackass. Hi, Scott. Sorry I'm late. Oh, wow. Is that punch? Looks good. It is good. Have a sip. - Thanks, Scott. - You're surely welcome. [Slurping, Gulping] Yuck. - [Smacks Lips, Sighs, Burps] - Holy crap. [All Groaning] A little bland. Your final test before you enter the Kappa brotherhood is a tricky one. Remember, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. And, Witherspoon, everybody knows you're the weakest link. - Move it, scum! - Weak links must be forged in fire. - Hold on, Scott. Scott... - Get over there, buddy. Come on now. Let's go. Take the hits. Aah! Yeah, like that. - I don't feel anything. - Aah! You suck! Aah! - Aah! - Jesus. [Laughs] Yeah! - [Grunts] - [Paddle Whooshes, Whacks] My mama hits harder than that. [Whistling] - Yeah! - [Whacking Continues] [Crowd Chattering, Shouting] [Cheering] [Announcer] Tonight, your Panthers face off against the mighty team... from Astoria University for a chance to lead the division... in something other than tuition. Chet, the Panthers haven't beaten Astoria in 30 years, but with Witherspoon in net this charged-up Stratford crowd... has found a reason to believe. [Chet] And Astoria takes the face-off and races down the ice... towards star goalie Witherspoon. [Grunts] [Chet] Oh! Witherspoon takes out one of the good guys! And Astoria picks up a gimme. Yeah! Whoo! - Goddamn! - Ah, God! Come on! - [All Moaning] - I'm gonna get outta here. Let's go. [Chet] With five minutes left, Astoria leads by 12. - [Horn Sounds] - Where is it? Where is it? - [Grunts] - This sucks! - [Whistle Blows] - Janice, baby, please be home. - [Bell Rings] Don't say anything, please. Oh. God, this is so hard for me. I'm sorry. You believed in me when nobody else did. You made me feel special, and I let you down. I betrayed you; I hurt you. And because of that, I might lose something that I want so much. I'm not gonna lose it without a fight. Look, I know this sounds crazy, but... I think I love you. I love the way you feel; I love the way you smell; I love your body. Damn, baby, your breasts got big! Ohh! No! [Grunts] Daddy, what... Darryl? This is the guy I was telling you about. Darryl? Mr. Tyson? What the hell are you doing here? - This is my daughter. - That's your father? So your mama must be black. Mr. Tyson, are you dipping in the chocolate? Is this the young man you've been seeing? Save your breath. I've already given myself the lecture. Now I'm gonna give you the lecture, Darryl. Next time you wanna pull that whole sweet, honest, decent young man con, do it on someone else. It wasn't a con. I am that man. - Spare me, Darryl. - I'm just going through a whole lot of stuff right now, okay? - What stuff? - Well... You know, I don't want to hear it. Look, it doesn't matter, okay? Lt'll all be over soon, I promise. Look, I'm every bit the man I said I was. - Why should I believe you? - Because I need you to. Come on. Trust me. I wish I could. J... [Sighs] [Patrons Chattering] Hey. Tim. Where you been, man? I've been looking all over town for you. - Look, I need your help, bro. - Yeah, anything. All right. Look. Tomorrow's the final competition for the Smythe-Bates job. Dude, I gotta study. Will you help me? Hell, yeah. I appreciate you helping me study like this, Dad. I'm not going to help you; they are. [Industrial Rock] - When growth funds do well, value funds do what? - Not so well. - As you can see... - Mm-hmm. Is perfect competition possible? The analytic model... - When growth funds do well, value funds do... - Not so well. - Because? - Because I said so. Can we move on? That isn't enough, Scott. What you're missing is the reason why. No, what I'm missing is the latte I ordered ten minutes ago. [Punk Rock] Well, I drink like a squid. [Man] The NASDAQ rebounded sharply from last week's slump... - [Man] Hey, my stocks are up. - [All Commenting] That doesn't make sense. Hey, smack him on the ass with that thing, will ya? Yeah, do it. No, don't do it. I'm kidding. - You really know this stuff. - [Chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, I like it rough. But you gotta speak up. I can't hear you! Janice? Baby? Janice, it's me, Darryl. Come on, baby. Pick up. No, I don't think the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve would do that in this case. Uh-huh. And who are you to say that? The, um, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. - Ouch. - But the bottom dropped out of the market... - In 1976 because of a hurricane that destroyed the crops. - All right! In between manufacturers of gross media parts is ignored, as is the chain of events that goes... "l" equals delta... Dog, you gotta go, eh? I can't go, man. I still don't have this chart down. Dude, you've been studying your ass off all night. - Put some faith in fate. You're the man. - All right. I think this Protocol 563 is finally leaving my system. - Hey, dog, I just wanted to thank... - [Tim Moaning] - Forget it. - I'll take care of the tip. All right. Oh, no! No! Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Hey, what's up? - Hi. Hey. - How you doing? - Hey, listen. I was wondering if you could show me where the Smythe-Bates building is. - You can't see? - Mm-mm, no. - You visually in-com-paired? - Impaired. Yeah, I can help you out, man. - Oh, thank you, man. Thank you, brother. - Brothers gotta stick together. - Oh, definitely. Thank you, brother. - Yeah, yeah. - You know, I know a shortcut. - Oh, really? - Yeah. This way. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. - Quick, hurry. - Thank God I met someone like you. - No, thank God I met somebody like you. - Huh? - [Punches Landing] - [Darryl Squealing] [Car Horn Honks] [Woman Screaming] No, I don't have it. Please, please... Just leave me alone. Go away! Stop it! [People Chattering] Excuse me. Excuse me. [Rattling] Excuse me, sir. Can you show me where the suits are? The drawers? Something. - This guy is on break right here, brother. - Oh, how you doing? - Maybe I can help you. - I've got this interview across the street in ten minutes. I just got robbed. That's why I'm sitting in your store assed out. - Look! Literally! - Yeah. Come on. Come on. This way. Follow me. Listen, my man. I got $50 in my right sock. I need this suit. I will come back tomorrow and pay you, I promise. - Okay. Young blind brother, I'm gonna fix you up real good. - My man. - [Woman] Smythe-Bates. May I help you? - [Elevator Bell Dings] Excuse me. Is this the 12th floor? - Yes. Sir, may I help you? - Yes. Where's the men's room? [Exhales, Screams] What the... No! I'll kill him! [Garbled] Aw, shit! Oh, what else can go wrong? [Liquid Dribbling] No! No! [Sobbing] No! No! [Sobbing] [Dr. Wheedon's Voice] The drug just has to pass through your system. Trust me, you'll know when it's gone. [Garbled] Oh, no. [Garbled Speech] [Panting] Together. Get... your shit together. [Laughing] I'm gonna pay you guys back. Can you believe me and the boys in Leverage Buyout got into a water fight? No. They're ready for you... now. - [Tyson] What time is it? - [Proctor] Twenty after. I made it. You're going to have to excuse the suit. Come to find out, I'm allergic to everything but polyester. My, uh, doctor prescribed this suit for me. Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to welcome you... here on this day of final competition... for the position of junior analyst. And we'll begin our questioning with you, Mr. Thorpe. Now, in structuring a portfolio for your client, what are the three most important rules? Well, first thing I'd do is talk to my client about his long-term goals. - Once those are explained to me... - Goods and services... are exempt from the discounting which classical theory demands. The effect of taxes defined by the Laffer Curve cannot be considered as valid... The leverage gained by buying on the market will multiply your returns... For our primary analysis, equity can't be considered in the same tier as secured debt. Small cap funds overpower high cap funds over time... If the poison pill doesn't work, you got a proxy war that's gonna depress your price. [Proctor] At this point, we would excuse three of our contestants. Fine job. Show them our appreciation. Mr. Auseppe, why would the Federal Reserve have resorted to this? I believe that would be in order to maintain a constant rate of growth... while avoiding incurring any excess inflation. Thank you, Mr. Auseppe. You may step down. And fine job. [Audience Applauding] Now, we are down to our final two contestants: - Mr. Scott Thorpe... - You lost your bitches, pimp daddy? - And Mr. Darryl Witherspoon. - What's up? Mr. Thorpe, if you were to be given control... of the Smythe-Bates venture capital fund, where would you take it over the next five years? Well, I think start-up industries in emerging markets... are the kind of low-risk, high-gain strategy I would pursue. Ah, so the rich get richer off the sweat of the poor, right, Scott? Maybe you should pay a visit... to one of those emerging markets you're so eager to exploit. I summered in Cancun. If that were me, I'd start a community-based bank and invest in areas... that these larger banks abandon. Abandon for good reason. That's why the poor get poorer. - Who taught you that? Your father? - Where's your father tonight? I'm about to kick your little ass. That's where he's at. Gentlemen, please. Let's keep it civil. We've got two excellent answers. Looks like we have a tie here. - Mm-hmm. - Professor Engel? All right, gentlemen. This last question is not a simple one, so I suggest that you choose your answers very carefully. Now, looking at this chart, what should the Federal Reserve choose to do? If I were, say, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, I'd raise rates. Excellent. - Mm-hmm. - Why? Hmm? "Why"? [Clicks Tongue] Because... That's a good question. - [Gasps] - [Scott] l... Uh, I have to say that I... don't know the answer. [Audience Murmuring] Mr. Witherspoon? Mr. Witherspoon? Yo! [Chuckles] Oh. Why raise the rates? Well... because of this chart reflecting Simon's theory. John Simon, born in 1908 in Westbridge, Indiana, predicts the future of inflation with the formula: I = delta MP over the square of T. Thus, requiring federal correction... as evidenced by the board in 1958, '67 and 1984. - [Audience Murmuring] - [Whispering] - [Murmuring Stops] - [Chuckling] Darryl, you've got the job. [Cheering] Wow! Thank you. Ebonically speaking, I know my shit. - [Applause Continues] - Thank you! - [Laughing] - [Tim Grunts] Wait. Hold up, people, please. I have something to say. - I cheated. - [All Gasping, Murmuring] No, not today. I studied very hard for this test today. But I had an extra edge in becoming a finalist. Not my athletic talent and not money. And it wasn't my daddy. - It was an experimental drug. - Oh! - [Audience Murmuring] - But it wasn't heroin! - He's not on the horse. - Tim, shut up. Sorry, but he's not using. [Whispers] It's all right. Mr. Tyson, Mr. Bellweather, I'm sorry. I was just willing to do anything to become a Smythe-Bates man, even the wrong thing. I want you to know I do deserve the job, even though I didn't earn it honestly. And that's the whole story. Look, I'm sorry if I let you guys down. You can't cut me off! I'm your son! You love me! Remember that time you almost said it? Well, folks, the board has come to a decision. There will be no junior analyst position awarded this year. But you still proved yourself the most impressive candidate. Come on, kids. Darryl, do you think that I was a junior analyst right out of Stratford? [Scoffs] Yeah. - Darryl, Daddy started in the mail room. - Get outta here! I tried to be the junior analyst, but... I didn't come from money. I didn't play sports, so... Sound familiar? So what are you saying? That you wasn't a Smythe-Bates man either? But I am, because I know my job and I work hard. Do you know who that reminds me of? - Me. - That's right. You are a Smythe-Bates man too, so you're going to have a second chance. At the point of graduation, you'll be given a job in the mail room. Doesn't sound like much, but if you work hard, in a year you'll make a fine junior analyst. Maybe a great son-in-law too? [Janice, Tyson Together] Don't push it. - Heh-heh! - Cool. [Siren Wailing] [Laughter] Everybody, a toast to my baby Darryl. Thank you for everything that you've done for us. And good luck tomorrow... on your first day as a junior analyst at Smythe-Bates. - [Guests Congratulating] - Darius! Touch that champagne bottle one more time, I'm gonna use your little ass as a cork! [Guests Laughing] Tim, let me take the camera so I can shoot you and your new girlfriend. Go stand over there. [Clears Throat] I just wanna make a toast, eh? [Clears Throat] Uh... Come here, honey. - I hate those things too, but... - Get in there, Lorraine. Ahsalam, Mrs. W. To... To Darryl. To your continued success on Wall Street, eh? [Chuckles] Thank you. Ma, are you gonna take me up on my offer? Darryl, I've lived here all my life. Besides, the place looks so nice now. But it's such a bad neighborhood. Why don't you let me move you over to the East Side, to a deluxe apartment, hmm? - [Woman] Well, we're movin' on up - Movin' on up - To the East Side - Movin' on up To a deluxe apartment in the sky - Movin' on up - Movin' on up - To the East Side - Movin' on up We've finally got a piece of the pie Fish don't fry in the kitchen Beans don't burn on the grill Took a whole lotta tryin' Just to get up that hill Now we're up in the big leagues - Gettin' our turn at bat - Good morning, Mr. Witherspoon.
