You're trespassing on someone's private property. And opening up a whole... ...illegal institution... I mean what's wrong with you. It's not so easy to win this case. But... we can't give at this stage. - He's here. Bajirao! - Where were you, sir? Fake college! - Oh God! Not just in this paper... ...but it's in every paper. Not just newspaper... ...but every news channel... ...is blowing Faltu college apart. We've officially become... ...a national disgrace. Read it. So this was UGC councilor, Mr. Vardhan. He exposed this news. Let us remind you about the news... ...that shook up the educational system. Fake college. Faltu. Papa. You cheat your parents. - Please. I've no place in my house for useless kid like you. You're dead for me. Never show me your face again. Never! Never! I made many excuses in front of you. But I won't do anything like that today. It's all because of me and... ...this was my idea. Son. You're a bigger scarp dealer than your father. I only... ...understood the worth of broken household articles. But you understood the real worth of these people. - What? Fool... ...look at them from the point of view of a scrap dealer. These kids are such scraps... ...who didn't even value themselves. Now... now look at them... ...here I'm seeing on their faces... What is it called? Confidence! I can see confidence. As if they've seen their destination. This is all because of your Faltu. I know you're ashamed that your father is a scrap dealer. But I'm proud of what you did. Come and hug me! Listen. This is a scrap dealer's view. Everyone doesn't think so. So you've to prove and explain all this to the world. You brought them here. It's your duty to get them out of this trouble. My businessman! They depend on you. Thank you, dad. Thank you. After mom's death... I saw tears in papa's eyes for the first time. I broke his heart... - Do you know... ...my father too cried bitterly. You're very lucky. My parents... ...didn't even answer my phone. They sent a message... ...that I should forget them... ...and never return home. Guys! What are you doing? Don't you want to make preparations? Sir, explain to them. What is he saying? I mean... - I've no idea. Look at them. - Sir, we've to give exam. Our term is about to end. Come on, Ritesh. Grew up, man. It's not a time to joke. No, dude. This is time for test. Guys, this test isn't of DJ, acting or management. This test is about our existence... ...and our belief. I'm sorry, guys. I know you're thinking of your families right now. But... I'm thinking of this family right now. About Faltu. Guys, we're not companion of such parties... ...but we've learnt a lot from one another. We've supported one another. No matter what the world says, but... ...I'm proud of myself and all of you guys here... ...for your achievements... ...for our achievements. I want to give you standing ovation. Faltu! Faltu! Faltu! Fully Faltu. - Wait. Listen. We're happy, but where is the exam? I suggested. Oh, yes... Our examination centre. It says college... "We've found our dreams..." Faltu, I'll tell you what I'm right now. I feel proud of it. Faltu can stop. We all have paid so much fees to get admission... ...in proper colleges and universities. And now we hear about Faltu university. I think it should shut down. I'm inspired by this Faltu website. I learnt dancing from Remo sir watching him on this website. So I think Faltu should continue. Parents who can't educate their children... ...can go to this website... ...see the lectures put up on Faltu college... ...and they can very well educate themselves. So I plead continue Faltu college. And I go against the government. Government has made big colleges. Private sectors have made it. Why? We've paid money for it. This is wrong and a crazy concept. I saw the website of Faltu college. I liked it very much. I think children shouldn't be stopped from such things. They took interviews of big people. They shared experiences. They've no college or campus. No matter their name... ...but they've set example for college. I feel concept is authentic. It's perfect for people like us. Stop this college. - Nobody can start college. I might do it too. Sir, investigation revealed that principal Bajirao of... ...fake Faltu college was a teacher in your school. He isn't worthy to be a teacher... - Sir, camera. He isn't worthy to be a teacher or a principal. You know... you know how he teaches tables of eight. "Eight times one is Eight. My sweetheart.' I mean this isn't the way. Hello. Yes, papa. Nair and uncle Nigam... Hello! And welcome to India's most... ...prestigious college talent show. Utsav 2011. Today to make this event special we've two special guests. I'd like to invite Mr. Vardhan of UGC councilor. Now it's time to welcome our second guest. The youth icon. The vibrant. The dynamic. None other than our honorable HRD... ...minister Subodh Chakravarty. And our first performance tonight is by YRD college. Please give them a big round of applause. Tell me, what is happening? By the looks of it seems to next happy event. "We've come to your doorstep, O' God!" "Show us the right path." "World has estranged us. Please accept me." Prepare for the show. Google and I'll handle the rest. Google. - All the best guys. Guys, people have said a lot about us but not anymore. From today Faltu should become a compliment. Are you guys with me? - Yes. Hip, hip, hurray! And our second performance tonight... ...is by Saint Francis college. Let's hear it for them. Excuse me. I want to talk to you. You're from Faltu. So, are you guys having fun? Do you want more? All right. So our next college is... "How long will this world sleep in slumber? ' "Lips are locked." "Dreams are restrained." "Beckon your heart.' "Strive for freedom.' "Beckon your heart.' "Strive for freedom.' "The steps taken in passion..." "...can't be stopped." "The hands of faith... is held by everyone.' "The steps taken in passion can't be stopped.' "The hands of faith... is held by everyone.' "Recognize the voice that touches the soul.' "Beckon your heart.' "Beckon your heart.' "Strive for freedom.' Yes! He's my son. Stop it. I say stop it. How dare you all get here. Mr. Vardhan. What's happening? I'm sorry, Mr. Chakravarty. They're not from any college. They're students from fake Faltu college which I closed down. They entered among the top colleges by deceit... ...and proved how shameless and fraud they're. You're right, sir. We're useless and shameless students... ...for whom you were just applauding. But it's not his fault. Our faces were in dark. Actually you're used to keeping us in dark. So when we got some light, you couldn't bear it. You shut up! Don't talk nonsense with me. You're strange, sir! We've always asked you question. But today when we're finally giving you an answer... ...you can't bear it. - You keep out of this. Do you think what you're doing is right. You're supporting these useless students. Sir, try to pay heed on this. Children are never useless. It's just that they're used less. You useless can only talk nonsense. But you can't proved anything. - You're right, sir. We're Faltu, but of use. Let's face the fact. Everyone studies to get a job. Our students know enough to get a... ...job once they're out of college. I don't think your top colleges can guarantee... ...hundred percent job placement. So please... - I don't think I want any more nonsense from you. Security, get them out. Just a minute. Stop it. News channel have said a lot about you. But I want to know your point of view. Tell me. What's your Faltu? Thanks for giving us a chance, but... ...we didn't come to prove ourselves. We came to see the faces of our parents. We did that. When we left home they were in tears. It's the same today. The only difference is that at that time it was of sorrow... ...but it's of pride now. Not you, but we've to question you. How is this education system? 35% is enough for passing... ...but 75% is required to get admission. So make 70% pass grade and fail the others. So that rest can attempt again. Where should we go? The majority between 35 and 70 is called Faltu. Whether you like it or not... ...Faltu arose because of your education system. Enough! You've said what you wanted. Can I say something? Yes, sir. I've a 5 years old granddaughter. She just started her school. She cries every day before going to school... ...and asks me... ...why is it important to study? I tried to explain her a lot. But I couldn't, but today... ...you gave me answer to all her questions. Education... ...isn't only books... So I officially approve Faltu... ...as one of the most important educational... ...institution for next 3 years. And may... there be many more Faltu. Thank you. Thank you. "I am oblivious.'
