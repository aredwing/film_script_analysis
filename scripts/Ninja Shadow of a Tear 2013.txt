Allied forces have reported the use of special Japanese ghost soldiers, who are said to be able to survive in the hostile jungle terrain for months on end using stealth tactics and crude ancient weapons. One thing is certain, her allies in the Pacific are pressing for yet another brutal encounter with the Japanese invader who poses an even greater threat with the use of the mysterious killing art known as "ninja. " [groans] [muttering] [chanting] Hai. Hai. Hai. Particularly, if you get married. [grunting] Are you sure you don't want to call the police? Yes, I'm sure. It's just money. They're still out there. No. Couple of punks looking for an easy score. Trust me. They're long gone. What? Are you sure you're okay? All right. You're right. I'm a little upset. About what? About the fact that... I didn't get you this sooner. What is it? Open it. The symbol for happiness. Mmm. Casey. It's beautiful. Here. For you. And our baby. You didn't finish your gyoza. [sighs] Lost my appetite. Not me. I love you. Me too. (Nam/kc) Casey. Casey, are you awake ? What's the matter? Nothing. Go back to sleep. No, tell me. Namiko. I want Black Thunder Chocolate. Again? Sorry. I'll get it. Never mind. It's okay. You don't have to. No, it's fine. I'll just run down to super, okay? I'll be right back. You really don't have to. Stop it. I want to, okay? Casey? In that case, can you also get some... Tao Kae Noi? Chocolate and seaweed? [bell ringing] [speaking Japanese] [wind chimes] [wind blowing] [door creaking] [gasps] [speaking Japanese] Konnichiwa. Namiko. You're never gonna believe how... No! Namiko! No. [sirens] [speaking Japanese] [chanting] (Casey) This was always a special place to her. This is where she took me after she told me she was pregnant. I didn't know. I'm very sorry for your loss. How did you hear? Thailand is not exactly the North Pole. She was like a little sister to me. What are the police saying? Robbery. They say it's a trend around here. I have my doubts. Doubts? It's not important. Why don't you come to my dojo in Thailand? Get away from this darkened place for a while. Train. Begin to empty yourself of grief. Thank you, senpai. But I have some unfinished business. What sort of business, Casey? Thank you for coming. Paying your respects. [helicopter whirring] [speaking foreign language] [door knocking] Come in. [grunts] I have a long memory. [grunting] [grunting] [bone crushing] [yelling] [whirring] [grunting] [screaming] [grunting] [speaking foreign language] Yes sir. Good. Okay. [grunting] Welcome... Casey-sen. I am pleased you changed your mind. It was a good time for me to come. [speaks Japanese] Awake from death. Return to life. I hope so, senpai. Casey-sen ... please meet Hiroshi and Lucas, my senior students. You don't remember me, do you? No. I visited Tagadao's dojo about 10 years ago. I came with Hiroshi from Toronto. You were already the man back then. I still tell people the way you sparred with the bow, fantastic. It was against, what was his name? Masasuka. That's it. Anyway, sensei said you might come here, and I'm glad you did. (Casey) So, why do you stay here in this country? I stay to honor my father's wish. Why Thailand? After the war, when my father returned to Osaka, he did not like what he saw. He said Japan had lost her way. My father was not what you call a flexible man. He was part of Fujita Seiko's special fighting force. Fujita Seiko? 1940, Fujita led 2,500 soldiers into the Burmese jungle. A unit trained like no other. A unit of ninja. 2,500 soldiers into the jungle, only 14 came out. My father was one of them. I believe he would've traveled all the way to Burma if he had been allowed to. But he settled here instead. Founded this martial arts school. Collected all the Asian artifacts. Excuse me. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] What is our code? To have no code. What is our way? Every way. What is our goal? To thrive in the shadows as our enemies perish in the sunlight. Ready? [speaking foreign language] [grunting] Sorry. [speaking foreign language] (sensei) Casey! Casey! I suppose you think you have an excuse for such behavior. I'm sorry, sen, but-- No apologies. Do you remember the [speaks Japanese]? Hai. You have lost control. It is time for [speaks Japanese]. Remember, you have to control your emotions. Do not let your emotions control you. Hai. [speaking foreign language] Hey. You need a bib. You need some manners. What? What? [grunting] [speaking foreign language] [bone crushing] [screaming] Get up. Hit me. Come on, hit me. Again. Yeah. Again! [panting] My 90d. What happened to you? Give me the basket. No, it's my turn. I got it. Just give it to me. I'll pick the fruit. Why are you helping me? It's okay. [panting] [grunting] [yelling] SenseL What happened? We found him dead in the-- [speaking foreign language] Senpai, I need to tell you something. The wound on Lucas' neck, it's the exact same wound as Namiko's. I was supposed to be in the woods... not Lucas. I see. There were three friends. Your father-in-law, Takeda, my father, and a rough boy from Nagoya named lsamu. They were the best students at the Koga dojo. When their sensei died, lsamu challenged Takeda for control of the dojo. There was a bad fight. Takeda killed lsamu. Killed him? Now Takeda was free to continue the tradition. However, he did not plan on one thing. Isamu had a younger brother, a boy named Goro. A boy who witnessed the death of his older brother. My father said he'd never forget the boy's words. After a few years, a rumor started. Goro had grown up to become a criminal. Started one of the major drug cartels in the Golden Triangle in Burma. Why are you telling me all this? 'Cause it's known Goro taught his men how to kill using the maneki kusari with barbed wire instead of chain. It became his signature. The wound you just saw. So you're saying-- I'm saying it's more than likely, Yes So, what? He's still seeking revenge? You're Takeda's son-in-law. This makes you a target. You need to return to the States before it's too late. You're telling me to run. I'm telling you to live. This isn't living. I'm going after him. I need to know exactly where he is. You're going to Burma? It's suicide. It's justice. It seems like revenge. You can call it what you will. You cannot go. I don't have a choice, senpai. All anyone knows is he's somewhere inside the jungles outside Yangon. A well-guarded secret. I'll find him. If I cannot talk you out of leaving, then you should take this with you. What is it? Belonged to my father. His lifetime in the jungle. This region is where he hid. What are these? Small plots near some old ruins where my father's unit buried their dead. It's said to be in the same region as Goro's compound is. My father told me that in each plot, there is a corner under which weapons were buried. It is marked with the old kujini hand signs. Exactly like these. [speaks Japanese] Casey. Remember... the man who seeks revenge should dig two graves. They're gonna need a lot more than that. Nineteen, 20. Taxi. Hello, sir. Please come. Please come. Yeah, please. Come. Right this way, sir. Please sit down. Welcome to our country, sir. A very hot country. [humming] What is your name, boss?

Go to hell, [speaking foreign language]. You're gonna tell me or I'm gonna cut your goddamn head off. I don't know who you talk about. Everyone know who he is, but no one meet him. [yells] [grunts] [hums] Hotel. What happened, boss? Let's go, now. Yeah, yeah. Now! Yeah.

You can save yourself great pain. Just tell me why you're here. And what do you want with Goro? I want to speak to the American or Japanese consulate. I'm sure you do.

[sizzling] [grunting] [punching] [grunting] [speaking foreign language] Where is he? Where's Goro? I don't know. Bullshit. You work for him. That's why you were asking me about him. Where is he? The tago. You're gonna have to get a little bit more specific. [coughing] Where? [speaking foreign language] Bye, sir. Boss! Boss! Keep driving. What happened? I said, keep moving. It was you. What? You're the only one alive who knew I was asking about Goro. Boss, I swear I-- No, don't, all right? Just... just don't. You work for them. No. No. I work for me. I only try to make living. I don't want trouble. I got trouble from you, trouble from police. I do what I have to do. All right. Just keep driving. Be careful, boss. The jungle is Goro's territory. His men are everywhere. Good luck, boss. Please be careful. Take me upriver. [speaking foreign language] (Casey) Goro. [guns cocking] [speaking foreign language] [grunting] [screaming] [grunting] Casey... I'm pregnant. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [foreign language mantra] And [indistinct] load? It will be done by next week. Mm hmm. Always some delay. Sales are up 15 percent. There is no one to rival you. Your enemies are disappearing. Yet you are unsatisfied. Forgive me, but you are addicted to worry. No. What is it then? Nothing. I was just thinking. Yes? At the end of the game, the pawn and the king go into the same books. I don't understand. [grunts] [speaking Japanese] [grunting] [cheering] What was that? [grunting] Goro. Who are you? Namiko married a kaiju. You know Namiko's dead, you son of a bitch. [grunting] [grunting] [yelling] Casey-sen. I'm very happy you are alive. Thank you, senpai. Tea? Please. So, tell me, what happened? Excuse me. What is our goal? To thrive in the shadows as our enemies die in the sunlight. It was you. What? You set this whole thing up. You sent those thugs to attack me. And you were in Osaka the minute after Namiko was killed. Lucas, too. How could you? It was not personal. Not personal? You needed proper motivation. You turned me into an assassin. I had to. Goro was becoming a big problem for my operation. I couldn't take a chance to get exposed. You were the only one who was skilled enough to find Goro. Kill him. --Been special. She was pregnant. I didn't know. Casey-sen, there are only two choices now. Either we join forces or one of us must die. There's only one choice. I see. [grunting] SenseL
