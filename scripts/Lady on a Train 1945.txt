"And yet, with a cold and horrible certainty, she knew that death was outside, "and moving relentlessly toward her out of the night. "Somehow, she forced her eyes to turn toward the window. "What horror she expected to see. "What horror she expect... Porter. Just a moment, please, sir. Take your bags, ma'am? Take your bags, ma'am? Bags? We're almost at Grand Central. Grand Central? What's wrong, lady? I just saw a murder. Murder! Murder, ou-out there. Say, porter, how about my bags? [Whispering] Bags? Yes, we're pulling into Grand Central! Grand Central? What's the matter with you? We just saw a murder! Wha... In a building we passed. An old man was killed. With a razor. No, with a crowbar. I've got to find the conductor. Thank you, sir. Conductor, if we entered this tunnel at 9:13, I mean 12:13... My watch is still on San Francisco time... And the rails go "click-click" every 21/2 seconds... See? Click-click. We're crossing one now. And each rail is 21 feet long... anyway, at 9:11 in San Francisco, if it's 12:13 here, it's, uh, 12:14 now. Where were we? Well, I was on my way to the baggage car. Oh, but you don't seem to understand. Grand Central. [P.A. Announcer] Leaving on track five... [Continues, Indistinct] No. ...Lime Falls, Scoville... No. Good heavens, no. Merry Christmas, madame. She must be on this train. After all, it is the train from Chicago. It ought to be the easiest thing in the world to meet a person. Oh! That'll only confuse her. Sorry. I am Haskell of the New York office. She's never met me. I've never met her. She's coming all the way from San Francisco... to spend Christmas with her Aunt Martha. This is just a favor I'm doing for H.G. A fine chap, H... Excuse me. That's quite all right. He wired me... Miss Collins! Miss Collins, I'm Haskell of the New York office. See? White carnation. How do you do? How do you do? Your father ordered me to keep an eye on you. It'll be a pleasure. Both eyes. [Chuckling] Fine person, H.G. In good health, I trust? Yes, thanks. Splendid. I've arranged a lovely apartment for you at the Park Towers Hotel. I do hope it'll be satisfactory. L-I say... I hope it'll be satisfactory. I'm sure it will be, Mr., uh... Haskell. Just think of the New York office. Yes. Now, Miss Collins, you must telephone your Aunt Martha right away. We want a taxi immediately. [Driver] Right here. Take me to the nearest... Park Towers Hotel, please. Oh! Um, the radio. The radio. What? Oh. Go ahead, driver. The radio. Taxi! Taxi! Young man, what are you doing with my radio? What? Park Towers Hotel? Yes. Oh, no. Take me to the nearest police station, please. Okay, lady, but they got better rooms at the Park Towers. [Ornament Clinks On Table] I'd like to report a murder, please. Okay. Look, could you come back tomorrow, miss? It's my day off. You don't seem to understand. I just saw a man killed. Tomorrow, please. Listen, I've just seen a murder committed, and if you don't report it, I'll report you. Just a minute, miss. Get me Inspector Quillan, homicide. If you knew the cranks we have to put up with... Hello, Inspector. This is Brennan. I got a dame here says she's just seen a murder. Oh, I'll ask her. Who was murdered? I don't know his name. She don't know his name. I'll find out. Where did the murder take place? Right outside my window. Right outside her window. Oh, well, just... Hold on, Inspector. Where do you live? San Francisco. San Fra... Well, never mind, Inspector, I'll call you back. Miss... New York on Saturday night is full of murders. Why do you have to bother me about one that happened in San Francisco? This murder happened right here. I saw it through a train window. There were two men in the room. One had a crowbar. The other was an old man wearing an overcoat and bedroom slippers. The first man held the crowbar over the old man's head like this. I'm sure I can identify the body... Just a minute. The Case of the Headless Bride. Bet that's exciting, huh? Full of murders. Yes, yes. Ten people. My, my. Did anybody in this book go to jail for malfeasance? For what? Malfeasance. That's makin' up a murder and takin' it to the police. Now get outta here. But, Officer... And the next time you dream up a mystery, let him solve it. I'm too busy. I'll find someone to listen to me. And that'll never stay on! But, H.G., I assure you... Put those things on that chair. But, H.G., l... But, H. G... Most decidedly, H.G. Absolutely. I did meet her at the train. I did. I don't know. I turned my back and she'd gone. Disappeared. Vanished into thin air. Then... Here she is now, H.G. Right here. It's your father. He's furious. [Stifles Laugh] What happened? Oh-Oh, your radio. I've had a terrible time. That isn't my radio. Where the devil have you been? What's happened? Why, Daddy darling, I do believe you're angry. You've been quarrelling with someone. Did Mr. Haskins say something to annoy you? Haskell. Oh, but he didn't lose me. I ran away from him. But, Daddy, I had to. He was stealing a radio. Now, Daddy darling, don't you worry about me. I promise I'll go to bed early, I won't talk to any strange men... and I'll call Aunt Martha the first thing in the morning, yes. [Smacks Kiss] I love you, Daddy. Bye. Do you have the audacity to say that I, Haskell of the New York office, stole a radio? Well, didn't you? Really! When you said, "Oh, the radio," and I turned, you knew perfectly well... Oh, you poor man. That eye. Tsk-tsk-tsk. Oh, it must hurt terribly. Oh! It is sheer agony. We must do something to get that swelling down. I know! Something cold. Ah! Hold this against your eye for a few minutes and it'll feel much better. Against it? Oh, it is cold! That's right. Yes, it is. Very comfortable. That's fine. Operator, I'd like to get the telephone number of a Mr. Morgan. A Mr. Wayne Morgan. That mystery-writing person? Is he a friend of yours? Huh-uh. I need his help. It's about a murderer. I have to get in touch with him. Huh-huh! Murderer, indeed. Pardon me. Your father told the whole office how you uncovered a spy in San Francisco. He had no right hanging around the Golden Gate Bridge! So you had him arrested. Certainly! He had buck teeth just like a Jap. That man was a member of the FBI. Operator, cancel that call. Now, you are not going to telephone the mystery writer. Once again, Roger's nimble brain had come to the rescue. Little did Count Cuchini realize that the deadly weapon... Roger pressed into his back... was only... A pipe. A pipe. How did you know? Mr. Morgan, in all your books you... Never mind! Roger smiled. He was quite handsome, this fearless young man. Handsome? Quite. He had, uh, piercing blue eyes, strong white teeth, and a bulldog chin... that typified strength and determination. No? No. Roger's chin, though some people might call it weak, typified far more strength and determination... than the proverbial bulldog variety. Mr. Morgan, there's a young lady outside, the same one that's been trying to see you for three days. Oh, later, Maxwell. As Roger stepped back, the sitting room door behind him slowly opened. A shot rang out! Then the shattering of glass. Roger clutched his side. Blood. He fell to the floor. [Yawning] Dead? No, wounded. Roger raised himself to one elbow. He must get help. Of course.! The phone. Despite the pain, Roger dragged himself across the floor. The phone. He must get... to the phone. [Clears Throat] My name is Nicki Collins. How do you... do? Where was I? You'd just been shot in the sitting room. Oh, yes. Later at the hospital, Roger... Mr. Morgan, you've got to help me. It's about a murder. Later at the hospital, Ro... Murder? Yes. It was on a train at night. Good. Very good. It was snowing. I looked out the window and saw a man killed. L... No. You looked in a window. Out the window's been done. This isn't a story. It happened! And instead of a man, make it a woman. A mangled, life... It happened? Yes. Mr. Morgan, you know all about murders. If you could... Go to the police. But the police... The police! Miss Fletcher. Later at the hospital, Roger had but one thought: He must return to the scene of the crime. That's it! What's it? I've got to locate the scene of the crime. I knew you wouldn't disappoint me. But we've got to work fast before my father finds out. Excuse me. Joyce! I've been trying to call you all morning. Who was that? Who was that? I never saw her before in my life. Type that up. Tear it up? Type it up! Believe me, darling. L-I never saw her before in my life. [Whistle Blowing] Hey, look. We're seein' things. A dame! [Horn Blowing] [Bell Ringing] Give you a lift, miss? Thanks. Just a minute. There you are. Thanks. What're you lookin' for? A room. I've been looking all afternoon. Got an extra one at my house. The room I'm looking for has a dead man in it. Come on. Excuse me, miss. Wayne! Wayne, darling, do you want to see me on the screen or don't you? Sorry, dear. Thanks. The doorman's wife just had twins. Newsreel theater. Yes, sir. [Horn Honking] Mr. Morgan! Taxi! Follow that car. [Newsreel Narrator] Who have we here, lending her graceful charm to our beauty parade? LovelyJoyce Williams. You see? It's on already. Miss Cafe Society oflast year has the latest fashion problems... right in the palm ofher hand. No wonder Miss Williams has that big smile on her face. What girl wouldn't, wearing this exclusive creation by Ducette? The puppet master pulls the strings... and other members of the younger set pass in review. Psst! This nonchalant ensemble... Excuse me. Mr. Morgan! Notice the petal-soft Angora Jersey... Excuse me. Excuse me. In its lovely shade of aquamarine. I've got to talk to you. What a feast for the eye. This scintillating display... Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Ofbeauty a la mode. How annoying! I'm sorry. [Packages Thudding] Oh! Darling, who is that? [Nicki] Mr. Morgan.! Shh! Who is that? No one, dear. Well, see what she wants. What do you want? I couldn't find it. What? Not now. The scene of the crime. You promised to help me. I didn't say I'd help you. I didn't say I'd help her. [Loudly] Go away! Young man, please. I'll see you tomorrow. What? Shh! I'll see you tomorrow. What? [Yelling] She'll see you tomorrow! Shh! Shh! [Embarrassed Chuckle] [Newsreel Narrator] The nation this week mourns the death ofJosiah Waring, world-famous ship magnate, here seen in his last public appearance. Josiah Waring, whose rise from steeplejack to head of a great industrial empire... was terminated when he fell to his death from a stepladder at his Long Island estate. That's him! Here we see him... at the launching of a few of the hundreds of vessels built by the Waring shipyards. Passenger liners, destroyers, freighters, tankers. Mr. Morgan, that's the man... Oh, excuse me. Now, stop this! Look here! Oh, please! That's the man... Sit down! That's the man I saw murdered. Josiah Waring died on Long Island. They could've carried the body there. It was in all the papers. He fell off a stepladder. It could've been a crowbar. We've got to investigate. - Shh! - I've had enough! Sit down, will ya? Shh! Shh! Mr. Morgan! But, Joyce, I never saw her before in my life. Mr. Morgan, wait a minute! [Narrator] This was his home on Long Island, the Willows, the only newsreel shot ever taken of this magnificent estate. Beyond this fence, in utter seclusion... [Owl Hooting] [Sighing] [Humming 'Pop Goes The Weasel'] [Humming] [Dog Howling] Pop Goes the wea... [Howling] [Barking] - Go away! Go home! - [Growling] Shoo! Nice doggy. There... [Barking] Nice doggy. [Barking Continues] [Vehicle Approaching] Good evening, Mr. Waring. What's the matter with them? I don't know. Duke! Spike! [Exhales Deeply] [Waring] Duke, Spike.! Come here. Come here. Come here. Come right here... boy. A fine way to receive... guests. They were just playing. They like pretty girls. [Whimpering] Their father must've been part wolf. [Barking] Say, how did you get... There's no need to apologize. Of course you're sorry. [Dogs Snarling, Barking] You should be. These dogs are vicious. They're dangerous! Why didn't somebody tell me about them when I came through that gate over... there? And... I'll bet I know who you are. Oh, you do? You're Margo Martin, right? You sing at the Circus, right? And you're here tonight because you think... [Barking] ...UncleJosiah's fortune, right? Are you worried, Miss Martin? Oh, uh, the dogs. Danny! Call the dogs. [Whistles] You see? Nothing to it. You think I'd be used to animals... from the circus. They have animals there? Oh, yes. At a nightclub? Oh, it's a... Oh, well, yes, yes. The, uh... The head waiter has a... has a... Pekingese. Put them back in their kennel. And the next time you let them out... I didn't let them out, Mr. Waring. Stop it! First I knew they were out, I heard 'em barkin' in the garden. [Waring] Don't let it happen again. Not very cozy, is it? It could stand a woman's touch. By the way, I'm Arnold. Arnold? Arnold Waring, the old boy's nephew. Oh, yes, yes, of course. I should've known. Why? We've never met. Oh, we... Um, well, that's what I meant. Of course we've never met. I should've known. You're, you're Arnold. [Arnold] Aren't you going to take your coat off? No, you better not. This place is like a tomb. [Man's Voice, Indistinct] ...Or government bonds... Hey, you. [Man Continues, Indistinct] Oh, there you are. Ladies and gentlemen, Margo Martin. [Group Muttering] Shh! H-H-How do you do? They won't bite ya. I don't think there's a good set of teeth in the room. You'll be all right. Sit down, Miss Martin. Scandalous. Where have you been? Oh, I just... Miss Martin. Now that we're all here, I will continue. "And to the heir or heirs thereof, I do hereby give... ' My compliments to the old gentleman. Pardon? You're not quite what I expected. I'm not? My uncle had very bad taste. You're good taste. Thank you. [Clearing Throat] My Aunt Charlotte. She'll say, "Jonathan." Jonathan! Go on, Mr. Wiggam. "To my dearly beloved nephew, "Arnold Waring, whose loyalty and devotion I heartily reciprocated, 'I bequeath the large and munificent sum of... One dollar. "One dollar. "And to my other dearly beloved nephew, Jonathan Waring, 'who expected nothing from me in life, I bequeath the legal equivalent of nothing: One dollar." Aren't you disappointed? On the contrary. He once threatened to cut me out of his will entirely. [Aunt Charlotte Clears Throat] "The rest, residue and remainder of my estate, "including... 3,000 shares of common stock... or full controlling interest in Waring Industries, Incorporated..." [Wiggam Continues, Indistinct] Danny! Does, uh, the boss know? Is he blind? [Wiggam] '... And also including the real property on 52nd street, 'New York City, "on which stands a building generally known as the Circus Club, "where I spent many a happy evening, I leave to my dearly beloved fiancee, Miss Margo Martin." Why, Aunt Charlotte! Slapping our only rich relative. UncleJosiah's dearly beloved fiancee. Young woman, how long has this been going on? Oh, uh, l... Answer me. How long? Please, she's on the verge of tears. Poor Aunt Charlotte. [Sobbing] You've got to understand. I'm sorry. I'll be all right in a minute. Jonathan, come back here. I'm disappointed in you, Auntie. Really, you should learn to control yourself. [Aunt Charlotte] Mr. Wiggam, let us continue. [Wiggam] 'I, Josiah Waring, in the city of New York, state of New York... ' [Continues, Indistinct] [Thudding] [Scraping Noise] Mr. Saunders. 'It is also my wish that the estate consisting of 67 acres, known as the Willows, become the property of said above mentioned Margo Martin. ' Blood. That dame! I think she's in the old man's room. If anybody asks you about her, she's left. [Door Creaking] [Wiggam] Mr. Saunders.! Mr. Saunders.! Where are they? L-Isn't somebody calling you, Mr. Saunders? Where are they? I mean, that is your name, isn't it? Because if it is... Saunders, I mean... and somebody's calling you, I think maybe you'd better... [Shouting] He's up here! Mr. Saunders is up here! [Wiggam] Mr. Saunders.! Where the devil are you? All right. Jonathan, wrap your throat up. You know how easily you catch cold. Yes, Aunt Charlotte. I'll meet you with the car. Haven't you forgotten something? Aren't you gonna kiss me, Aunt Charlotte? [Snickering] Nobody loves me. Mr. Wiggam, will you please inform that woman... that this house does not become her property until tomorrow. Oh, come now, Aunt Charlotte. Lots of people open their presents on Christmas eve. Would you like a lift back to town? Yes. Yes, thank you. [Wiggam] Mr. Saunders, could I see you a moment? I'd like to talk to you about the Waring securities. Yes, they're in the safe, I believe. I'll send them to your office. I'll turn the car around. Now, don't run away again. Uh, you forgot your gloves. Oh, yes. Would you like a lift back to town? Your brother's already asked me. You'd be much safer with me. I'm sure you're both gentlemen. My brother's irresponsible. I'll bet I have my dollar long after his has slipped through his fingers. You know, wine, women, song. Bad investments. May I see you again sometime Miss Martin? May I? Really, l... Jonathan! Excuse me. Good-bye. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Lookin' for somethin'? No. No, l... I mean... [Saunders] Danny.! [Horn Honking] [Arnold] All set? Good-bye. It was awfully nice to have met you. Uh, both of you. Get in on this side, Miss Martin. It, uh, seems to have... stopped snowing. She's got them! What if he finds out? Think you could get those slippers, Danny? What do you think? Take my car. Thank you very much, Mr. Waring. Good-bye. We are going to see each other again, you know. Are we? Oh, yes. Good-bye, Miss Martin. Good-bye. I mean, um... When you said we were going to see each other again, did that mean we were going to because... Well, I mean, when? Maybe I can come to the Circus Club and hear you sing some night. Oh, that's what I mean. You come to the Circus Club and... Oh. Oh, well, um, good-bye. I'll be seein' ya. Whew! But really, Inspector, there must be something you can do. There must be. I? Well, no, nothing. I've been too busy. Tomorrow's Christmas, you know. Miss Collins has been missing since this morning. I have no idea. No, she comes up to about here on me. To about here.

Your father's been calling all evening. Oh, my. First he telephoned the hotel, then your Aunt Martha. Then I call... Oh-ho! Men's bedroom slippers. Where did you get those? These? Those. I... found them. You found them? On the street. On the street? You picked them up? Miss Collins? Yes! It's good luck to find shoes... on the street. Um, you know, um, ah... Find shoes before dawn, have luck on... the morn. You never heard of that? Never. I've heard, find a penny in the well, and all your troubles, uh, disappear. No, it's a rhyme. It's the same thing, only with shoes. It is? Oh, it's a superstition. Yes. That's right. Now, this is the present for your Aunt Martha. I'll wrap that. And, uh, this little gift is for you from Santa Claus. Of the New York office? [Guffawing] [Phone Ringing] Hello? Yes? Oh, no, operator. No, no, no. No one here asked for the address of the Circus Club. Must've been someone else. And operator, how about that San Francisco call? Miss Collins is here now. Oh, I see. Well, keep trying, won't you? Miss Collins, all the San Francisco lines are busy, but the operator will call. Thank you. See you in the morning, Mr. Haskell. Thank you. Pleasant dreams. Find some shoes... It does have a familiar sound, that shoe poem. Find some shoes upon the lawn, and you'II... be lucky... I know, Mr. Morgan, but it's very important. But you've got to come over. It's about... But, Mr. Morgan, please. Miss Collins, I don't care. Wayne. Yes, dear. Oh, it fits beautifully. I don't care what it's about. I'm not coming to your hotel. Wayne, darling, this is heavenly! Oh, shut up! Pardon me, dear. Miss Collins, I'll give you fair warning. I'm going to... I'm not coming to your apartment. But you can't hang up on me. But... [Wayne Continues, Indistinct] But you've got to come over, Mr. Morgan. There's a man in my apartment. Oh, he's got a gun! He's coming closer... and closer. Oh, don't shoot! Please don't shoot!

[Haskell Moaning] [Thudding] And now, suppose we call the house detective. Suppose we don't. Stick 'em up. That's a pipe. See? Now call the house detective. [Groaning] Aah! Hey! [Shouting, Grunting] Let me up! Stop it! Oh, hello. Hello. [Chuckling] Mr. Haskell, Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, Mr. Haskell. How do you do? How do you do? Mr. Wayne Morgan? Are you in the habit of visiting strange young women uninvited? Yes, if necessary. In the middle of the night? Wearing pajamas? Yes, if her life is in danger. Who's wearing pajamas? Oh, yes. Aren't you? Mr. Morgan didn't come uninvited. I asked him over. You asked him? Of course. There was a man in her room. Oh, no. I just made that up to get you over here. - Then who hit me on the head? - He did. I was hit on the head too. There was no man... Oh, I know. You hit each other on the head. He didn't hit me. I was hit by a total stranger with a slipper. Believe me... With a slipper? Yes. And you call yourself a detective-story writer! What? You let that man hit you and get away! But l... Those slippers meant... just everything, that's all. I lost a brand-new overcoat. Why is she so upset about a pair of slippers? She thinks they're good luck. Oh? You know, find shoes before the dawn and you'll be lucky. Miss Collins? Miss Collins? - Where'd she go? - I don't know, but I know where I'm going. Hmm? Or is it, find shoes amid the corn... Thank you. And you'll be lucky in the dawn... or in the morn? Or on the... Mr. Morgan! [Swing] Has Margo gone on yet? Not yet. She's in her dressing room. Thank you. Pardon me.

[Muttering] Huh! That window. [Chuckling] Old Mr. Waring had the most fantastic ideas. Will you stop talking about him? Temper, temper! Get out! And... leave me alone. I'll never forget the night he had it installed. You were out there, and he was in here, and you couldn't see him, but he could see you. [Glass Breaking] Temper, temper! Idiot! [Man Muttering] [Glass Crunching] Want a light? Miss Martin, you don't know me. That's right, I don't. And you don't know what I'm doing here. What are you doing here? In fact, you've never seen me before in your life. We covered that. Good. Now we're getting somewhere. Miss Martin, what did that sign mean, "Margo... Closing tonight"? It means I'm getting out of here tomorrow. Oh. But you're getting out now. I wouldn't throw away the picture of a man... who just left me a million dollars. Who told you how much I was left? Who told you? Say, you, uh, better stick around. I'd like to have you meet some friends of mine. Why, I'd be glad to. Just make yourself at home. Sit down and take it easy. Thank you. Oh, it's a mirror. You see, Miss Martin, I know a lot of things about you that you don't know... Know that I know. [Gasping] For instance, I know... Look, kid, I've got a show to do now. I've got to change. Miss Martin? Oh, hello. Why didn't you tell me you were closing tonight? I had to hear you. Thank you, Mr. Waring. Not Mr. Waring. Arnold. Well, I'II, uh, I'll see you out there. Uh-huh. Later on we'll have a drink together and... a nice little chat. And you'll tell us all you know... and we'll tell you all we know, and everything will be fine. Where'd you get those? Oh, um, these are just some flowers for you. Who from? Oh, uh, l... I guess the card is in the box. Look, kid, if you don't mind, I'd like to open my own flowers. Hey.! Hey, open up.! What is this? Hey, open up.! Let me out.! Matches? Thanks. Well, do you forgive me? This is wonderful. Let's quarrel again next Friday night. I'm dying to go to the Stork club. Well, do you forgive me? You said that. Oh, did I? I'd better call mother and let her know where we are. Be a dear and get a table. Right. [Orchestra Playing Dance Music] Waiter, when does Miss Margo Martin go on? Oh. Never mind. [Man] Psst.! Miss Collins. Please get out of here. You'll spoil everything. Why didn't you tell me you were Margo? Shh! I'm not Margo. Please go. I've got bus... Shh!

[Chuckles] Sit down. I feel kind of Ionely here. So I say, "Miss Martin, Aunt Charlotte is here to apologize." Is that it? "Aunt Charlotte is here to explain." I'll not apologize to that woman. Well, then, what are we here for? I'll not apologize. Well, then I'll say, "Miss Martin, Aunt Charlotte is here because she thinks she acted a bit hastily." That's better. Aunt Charlotte. Haven't you forgotten something? Hmm. Thanks. Uh, Mr. Wiggam. Will it be all right if I take in a movie for about an hour? Why, certainly. Thank you, sir. But, darling, I assure you, I can explain!

[Saunders] You'll do as you're told. But I tell you, he's outside. I'm not going to. I don't want any part of it! [Danny] Hey, boss. [Sobbing] Okay. If you get scared, lock yourself up again. Well? Have you got them? Good. And whenever he was in town, your uncle would always take me to that little Italian place. You know how he was about spaghetti. But he hated spaghetti. Oh, well, uh... He'd be furious after we got there. Miss Martin. As a matter of fact, he... You're wanted in your dressing room. Excuse me. Say, wait a minute. Keep moving, sister. You know I'm not Margo. Tell it to the manager. Uh-oh. [Clears Throat] Good evening, Miss Collins. Sit down. Go on. Sit down! Since you've started meddling you've found out quite a lot. You know that Josiah Waring's death was no accident, eh? You know he was murdered. You're a very clever young woman. But you should be more careful. If you were to meet with an accident, no one... I'm not afraid of you, Mr. Saunders, and do you know why... Why I'm not afraid of you? No, Miss Collins, why? Because right now, at this very minute, a pair of slippers are on their way to the police. A pair of bloodstained slippers which will proveJosiah Waring was murdered. You seem frightened, Mr. Saunders. You're saying to yourself, "The jig is up! I've got to get away!" You're right. There's only one thing for you to do. Give yourself up. Tell everything. [Chuckles] Or else... make a run for it. No, you don't. I'll take that coat. [Nicki] The slippers.! This way, Mr. Morgan! We can get out through here. I'm a little mixed up. What about? Aren't you on their side? I'm on your side. But you're Margo. No. I just took her place. You took my place, and you can keep it. And good luck. Oh! That's Margo. I knew you'd understand. These slippers are the only proof that Josiah Waring was murdered. I'm going to take them to the police. Oh, I hope I haven't caused you too much trouble. Miss Collins, we first met at 10:00 this morning, didn't we? Yes. Since that time, you've had me thrown out of a newsreel theater, chasing around Manhattan in my pajamas on Christmas eve, conked on the head by a total stranger, robbed of my favorite overcoat, and my fiance, whom I've begged to forgive me... twice a day for the last three years, will undoubtedly never... let me beg her to forgive me again. But the evening's young. You probably haven't even got rolling yet. So I think I'll stick around. That's very sweet of you, but I can handle this alone. Everything's all right now. I'll take those slippers. Oh, no, you don't! Stick 'em up. That's a pipe. Psst! Psst! Miss Martin! Come here. I can't. I have to go. Hello. I've been looking all over for you. Oh, hello. I wanted to find you before you joined the clan. Oh... Mmm. I always thought a circus was kid stuff. [Chuckles] But I really... Shall we take the shortcut? Miss Martin, Aunt Charlotte is here tonight to apologize. She feels she acted a bit, uh, a bit absentmindedly. "Absentmindedly"? Yes. She forgot that you'd been left all the money. Now, Arnold has an excellent memory. He didn't forget. Oh. Oh, oh. I see. And, uh, are you after my money too? After you, I'm after your money. Dancing! You wouldn't think his uncle had just passed away. Another martini, please. And put a black olive in it. Yes, sir. You know, Aunt Charlotte doesn't like this. I don't like Aunt Charlotte. Not liking Aunt Charlotte could become a national pastime. But I think we'd better face it. I don't like it. That guy really worked on me. Danny, come here. Look where she is. Gee. Right under his nose. Lucky we got the slippers. We haven't. Where are they? Right under his nose. What Aunt Charlotte really means... Never mind! You see, since the Long Island estate has been ours... At least sentimentally... Of course, legally, we could contest. Mr. Wiggam, it is not our wish to go to court. No, we might lose. Please! Uh, you see, we, we thought... That is, we felt that, under the circumstances, you might allow it to remain in the family. Someone wishes to speak with you. Excuse me, please. Hello. Miss Collins, this is Wayne Morgan. I'm calling from the phone booth near the bandstand. Can you see me? - Oh, yes, I can see... - Shh! Be careful. I'm... I'm your girlfriend. Oh. Oh, yes. Oh, uh, hello, Emily. Now, listen. Don't let anyone at your table see those slippers. Anyone! But... But, Emily... But, Emily, l... Don't talk. The murderer is one of the men at your table. At my table? Oh... Uh, oh, uh... Oh, no, Myrtle. Emily. Emily. Uh... Uh, no, Emily. You, um, you didn't leave your purse at my table. I've got to see you. Don't worry about the chauffeur. I knocked him out and took his revolver. Hello? Hello? Hello? Take him downstairs. Dave. Okay. Oh, well, l... I think I'd better... Really, Miss Martin, if the Willows were allowed to remain in the family, we should all be deeply grateful. Oh, you can keep the house. Psst.! Better get back, Margo. It's time for your next number. Oh, uh, I'm afraid that l... Miss Martin, you're very generous. You've no idea what this means. Oh, well, that's all right. If there's anything else you want, why, you just ask for it. You don't have to thank me. Well, see you later. There's something very strange about that young woman. Did you have to dance with her? Yes, and I liked it. Jealous, Aunt Charlotte? [Saunders] Miss Collins.! Give me those slippers! [Danny] When you come to, you can help yourself to the brandy. Mr. Morgan? Mr. Morgan? [Groaning] Mr. Morgan, are you all right? Ooh. Why does my head hurt? That's where he hit you. But I knocked him out. Then he knocked you out. Oh, you shouldn't have come back here. I had to. I couldn't leave you... [Door Opening] Danny? Danny, have you got him? [Mimicking Danny] Right here, boss. Don't worry about the slippers. I hid them. Shh. Hey. Get out of here. I'll meet you out front. Take it easy, goldilocks. Just make yourself at home. I'll be back in a minute. [Man] Margo.! Margo.! Where's Margo? She's on.! [Cat Meowing] It's no use. [Buzzer Buzzing] [Man] 'Night and Day'next. 'Night and Day. ' Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom When the jungle shadows fall Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock As it stands against the wall Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops When the summer shower is through So a voice within me keeps repeating You, you You Night and day You are the one Only you Beneath the moon and under the sun Whether near to me or far It's no matter, darling where you are I think of you Night and day Day and night Why is it so That this longing for you Follows wherever I go In the roaring traffic's boom In the silence Of my Ionely room I think of you Night and day Night and day Under the hide of me There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning Burning inside of me And its torment won't be through 'Til you let me spend my life Making love to you Day and night Night and day Night And Day [Laughing] Balloon? Yeah. [Pop] [Gunshots] [Woman Screaming] [People Murmuring] [Woman] He's dead.! Who is it? Saunders! The manager. You can't go back to your hotel. It won't be safe. We're going to your place. I have to get the slippers. Cover the place, boys. Oh, uh, my slippers. I forgot them. [Chuckles] Hey, lady. [Snoring] My, my. [Snoring] [Sighs] Good morning, Miss Fletcher. Hello, Maxwell. [Snoring] Well. [Chuckles] I just came up, and there he was. Hmm. Hmm. Oh. Hello. Good morning, Miss Collins. It's all right, Maxwell. Everything's fine. "Everything's fine." W-We're working on a murder together. Oh? Yeah, I stayed here all night. Oh. Yes, it, uh... it was safer than going home. [Snoring] I don't doubt it. [Snoring] Does he always snore like that? I am his secretary. [Doorbell Buzzing] It's his fiancee. No, not that way. Upstairs. Mr. Morgan. Oh, Mr. Morgan. Please wake up. [Doorbell Buzzing] Oh, but you've got to wake up! Oh. [Maxwell] Mr. Morgan ain't homejust now. I'm sorry. I can't let you in. I ain't supposed to let anyone in without Mr. Morgan's permission. Young man, I don't care to argue with you. I am Haskell of the New York office. I demand admission! Mr. Morgan? Mr. Morgan? [Snoring] [Haskell] Oh, there you are. Why, you... You... Where is she? [Snoring] Where is she? [Snoring] Snoring won't get you anyplace. Come, come, come! Where is she? Where's who? Where's Miss Collins? Oh, Miss Collins. Oh, she's... What makes you think she's here? She's not at her hotel. She's not at her Aunt Martha's, and you are... Ah-hah. What? I said, "Ah-hah." Mr. Morgan, why did you spend the night on this couch, unless... Wait a minute. I can explain everything. That's a bedroom, isn't it? Yes, but... You expect me to believe that she's not in there? Yes. [Stammering] No. I mean... Look. I might as well tell you everything. I was... Good morning, darling. My secretary, Miss Fletcher. How do you do? How do you do? Your secretary? Uh, we worked late. Oh. Mm-hmm. Yes. Well, I'll be running along. Oh! Your secretary. Oh, of course. I understand, yes. That's how I met Mrs. Haskell. [Chuckling] I was her secretary. [Chuckling] Well, good-bye. Mr. Morgan ain't in. Step aside. I ain't supposed to let anybody in without Mr. Morgan's permission. Hey, you. Do you recognize this? It was found in the Circus Club last night. Yes, that's my coat. That's the man! Why, you're... For what? You're under arrest. Suspicion of murder. [Nicki] Wait.! - That's ridiculous. - Good morning, Miss Collins. Mr. Morgan did not kill Mr. Saunders, and I can prove it. I'll show you the slippers. You just dropped one. Oh, not those. Josiah Waring's bloodstained slippers that'll prove... Where are they? Looking for a pair of dirty old slippers, sir? Yes, Maxwell. [Chuckles] Notice anything different? Sure took a lot of elbow grease. [Chuckles] Good. Very good. [Wayne] What's very good? That we're in jail. That's good? Of course. At last, the police are interested. [Groaning] I'll say they're interested. "The state of New York versus Wayne Morgan." Do you realize that I'm under arrest for murder? Mm-hmm. Part of my plan. Part of your... Aren't you gonna ask, "What plan?" I'm afraid to. It's very simple. All you have to do is tell the police that you murdered Saunders. They'll let me go. That'll put the real murderer off guard, and I'll be able to trap him before they convict you. Well? No, I couldn't let you take that chance. Oh, but, Mr. Morgan, it would solve the whole case. Trade you. It's like one of your books. You know, the last chapter. I like that. You do? The last chapter. The end. The finish. Roger... Roger smiled grimly, for he knew he must die. Die bravely. Die for a murder which he never committed. That's wonderful. [Chuckles] Then, suddenly, he thought of her. Of her? Of... - What's your name? - Nicki. And suddenly he thought of Nicki. Of the beautiful girl who had, all unconsciously, lured him to his death. And then he knew. He knew that, in spite of everything, Yes? In spite of all she had done... Yes? [Keys Rattling] [Haskell] There you are, Miss Collins. Oh, I can't believe it. I simply can't believe it. To think that a daughter of H.G. Would wind up in the big house! Oh, this isn't the big house, Mr. Haskell. It's more like their, uh, New York office. Really, Miss Collins. Well? Must be one of these. Oh, here it is. No, that isn't it. Ah. See? Murderer. Goodness knows what your Aunt Martha is going to think of me. Now you won't have to confess. Thanks. Oh, please don't worry. I'll get... [Haskell] Miss Collins.! H.G.'s daughter, chatting with a killer! Now, I'm going to post your bail, so you follow me very closely. Here she comes now. [Haskell] Now, Miss Collins, if you'll just stay by me, everything will be all right. There, you see? They're all gone. You remain here for a moment. I'll get you out so fast, they'll never see you. I'll use the old Haskell "T" formation. Grab it, Ted! Now, gentlemen, you're just wasting your time. Miss Collins refuses... Big smile, Mr. Haskell! Big smile! No! No pictures! Now look, Mr. Haskell. We gotta have a statement. Thank you, Miss Collins. The crime pinup girl of the year! Gentlemen, no! You, in the gray coat! Put that camera away. I must insist on no publicity, or H.G. Would be horrified. You in the gray camera, put that coat away. [Indistinct Shouting] Miss Collins.! Thank you. Gentlemen, I must insist upon the return of those exposed negatives immediately. Come. Thank you. And you... [Indistinct Chatter] Oh. How would you like to get outta here, Miss Collins? I'd love to, but l... I've already bailed you out. Had a pretty tough session with the family last night. They'd like to see you right away, that is, if you'd like to see the family. Let's go. [Haskell, Reporters Talking] [Haskell] Good-bye. [Reporter] Thank you very much, Mr. Haskell. Officer, where's Miss Collins? Why, she's gone. Gone? I came to bail her out. She's been bailed out. That's impossible! Miss Collins! Come back to jail immediately! Hey, Jim, come in here. Uh, I'd like to post bail for Miss Nicki Collins. Brother, so would everybody in New York. She was just bailed out. Really? By whom? Waring. Arnold Waring. Arnold? Anything wrong? I hope not. May I ask you a question, Miss Collins? Of course. How did you find out that my late lamented uncle was... murdered? You know that? Oh, yes. That's what l... the family... want to talk to you about. Read all about it.! Read all about the big nightclub murder! Margo. Didn't you know? She was found strangled in her apartment. You didn't answer me. How did you find out that my uncle was murdered? I, um, I saw it. You saw it? Well. We'll be at the office in a few minutes. It's closed. There's no one here. That's funny. I know. Let's drive around through the alley. By the way, Miss Collins, did you see who killed my uncle? Not his face. It was dark, and he was turned away. But I think it was a younger... You were about to say something. No, I wasn't. You were about to say you thought it was a younger man, and you stopped talking because it suddenly occurred to you... that I might be that younger man. - Yes. - Who told you I hated my uncle? No one. Oh. Well, I did hate him. But so did Jonathan and Wiggam, and especially Saunders. [Arnold] You know, Saunders had the most to gain. You see, he was in... Hey! Come back here. Oh, come now. Let's not play games. Miss Collins! You little fool! I just want to talk to you! Don't run away. I'm not gonna hurt you. Miss Collins. Don't go out there. It's your brother. He's upstairs. He did it. He killed your uncle. He'll kill me! Not if you keep quiet. Come with me. [Door Slamming Shut, Elevator Humming] Quick, we can make it. Miss Collins? Miss Collins! [Elevator Humming] [Sighing] He's gone. Yes, but he's still in the building, so maybe we oughta... Why, that's strange. You know, in a room something like this one... [Train Bell Ringing] In a room something like this one, I saw your uncle murdered. Exactly like this one. Then... you're... Yes, Miss Collins. The same man you saw doing this... once before. Now, no one on that train can see your silhouette. In a moment, the train will have moved on. But... But the police. What about the police? They're bound to investigate. They'll find out you killed your uncle. Why should I have killed my uncle? For his money. Margo got his money. They'll find out you were Margo's boss. Saunders was Margo's boss. They'll find out you were Saunders's boss. Not from Saunders they won't. - You'll never get away with it. - But I will get away with it! You... You will? In a little while, I'm sending for the police. You see, they already know how worried I am about you. And when they arrive, they'll find... a very beautiful young woman, the victim of a rather affectionate maniac. My brother Arnold. And Arnold destroyed by his own brother, the protector of the Waring honor, myself. But they'll know you killed him. Of course. But they'll find this in Arnold's hand, and they'll thank me for killing him. I wouldn't try to run away, Miss Collins. UncleJosiah, Saunders, Margo, Arnold, and you. Then I'll have to start on the other hand. - With Aunt Charlotte? - Oh, no. I like Aunt Charlotte, and she likes me. I've always been her favorite nephew. And she's been more than an aunt to me. Even when I was a little boy, every night she used to... [Train Wheels Squealing] The train's pulling away. You know, it's too bad you don't like me. Oh, but l... B-But I do like you. You... You remember, we, we danced together. Yes, I remember. Ah-ah! Come here, Miss Collins. [Door Opening] [Chuckles] I'm sorry. That's a closet, Miss Collins. Yes, I remember dancing with you. And I remember thinking how lovely you looked, and how someday you and I... would be in this room, alone. You see. [Glass Rattling] Don't worry, Mr. Waring. I'm not. Now. [Arnold] I always hoped something like this would happen. You see, I never liked you. This will be a very great pleasure. [Jonathan] Arnold, you mustn't. I'm your brother. Here. Keep him covered. It's all right, darling. You're safe now. Turn around. You heard him. Turn around! He's talking to you. Oh. Then he's... Uh-huh. Oh. You'd better have another chapter, Mr. Morgan. I don't like sad endings. Wait. Mr. Waring. What would you say if I told you that I didn't come here alone? I'd say you had a wonderful imagination. What would you say if I told you... that I was followed here by the police? I'd say you were a detective-story writer. What would you say if I told you that... now, at this minute, three heavily armed policemen stand outside that door? [Laughs] I'd say, "Come in, gentlemen." [Footfalls] Darling. [Thud] [Nicki Gasps] Oh.! Oh, get some water, please. Oh, darling, you're wonderful. [Groaning] ['Here Comes The Bride' On Soundtrack] [Buzzer] Come in. Would you folks like your berths made up now? Come back later, please. [Porter] Yes, ma'am. Do you know what, darling? What? This is your finest book. Oh. - The man with the green hat did it. - Of course. That's why he... Oh, Wayne. Now you've just spoiled the whole book. I could've looked in the back if I wanted to peek. Why did you...
