Don we now our white apparel Fa la la la la la la la la! Smurf the ancient Yuletide carol Fa la la la la la la '3444. What in the blue blazes? Grouchy's house is as bare as a Smurling's bottom. Oh, my- Grouchy, what's wrong? Oh, you mean other than being bothered by carolers, who aren't even in tune, by the way. - What's gotten into him? - What do you mean? He's always... Grouchy. Yeah, but not at the holidays. Yeah. You always decorate for the holidays. I hate decorations. Okay. But you're still coming to the big party tonight, right? Every Smurf helps decorate the tree. You call that puny twig a tree? Count me out. But we always decorate as a family. Yeah. And you always put the Mar on top of the tree. He's rlght, Grouchy. That very Important task belongs to you. You know what, I hate tasks. I hate stars, mistletoe, candy canes, stockings, and fruitcake. I hate Christmas. How can someone hate fruitcake? It's delicious. Oh, Papa, you need to do something. It just won't be the same if we can't all celebrate together. I have an idea. A dash of nutmeg, a touch of holly. What exactly is this potion, Papa? The Christmas spirit, designed to show him the true meaning of the holiday. And now the final ingredient, essence of smurfberry. Fa la la la la la la la lame! How do you smurf a hall anyway? I hate warm smurfberry nog. But I also hate being thirsty. I suddenly feel sleep... Who turned out the lights? Wow. My stomach is looking flat. What's up there? I got a blue belt in smurf-fu and I'm not afraid to use it. You really should sweep that thing once In a while. - Smurfette? -I'm the Smurf of Christmas past. Don't you see my smurfy wings? Oh, my- I shouldn't have had that second glass of smurfberry nog. Oh, go away. You're just a figment of my indigestion. No! I'm one of three spirits that's going to visit you tonight. It seems that you lost the true meaning of Christmas. So our job is to help you find it. I think I'll pass. Feel free to use the door on your way out. Oh, I'm not leaving until I take you on a magical journey back in time. Congratulations! Nothing happened. What the smurf? I hate mornings. Except for Christmas morning. - Hey, It's ma. -It ls you. But a you from long, long ago. Presents, here I come. Christmas was always the one time of year when you put your grouchiness aside. Jingle Smurfs Jingle all the way! The past me is so annoying. Weird, right? Wait till you see this. Neat, huh? Hey, I remember this. And here you come now. - Merry Christmas, Grouchy. - Yeah. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. The sooner I get to my chair, the sooner I get to open my presents. Merry Christmas, Grouchy. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Grouchy. - Merry Christmas, Grouchy. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Grouchy. Yep. Whatever. Merry... I don't have time for this. Seriously! We got to got to our out: now. Enough I: enough. Come on. Let's dance. - I hate dancing. -Really? That's not what it looks like to me. Hey! Gather around, Smurfs. Gather around, everyone. Hurry up, Grouchy. It's time to open your presents. Oh! This was a long time ago. Please let me get It. Please let me get It. Please let me get It. - Get what? -What I'd asked for for Christmas. A hang glider. It's like a giant paper airplane you can fly in. I know. It's gonna be the smurf. And for you. And for you, and for you. Merry Christmas. For you. And for you. It's not very big. All right. Open them up. A new hat. A new hat. - A new hat. - A new hat. - A new hat. - A new hat. A hat. Whoa! A new hat. A new hat. Again. All I ever wanted was that hang glider. Every year I ask Papa for it, but did he ever come through? Let's find out. And then a few years later, and every year after that. Seriously! And then there was last year. Hey, look. Papa asked me to give this to you. Look! Finally! Kidding! Here's your real gift. Whoa! A new hat! Isn't Christmas about getting what you want? Well, I want a hang glider. Why do I even bother to celebrate Christmas If all I ever get is this? The same old boring, useless hat. I mean, how many hats does a Smurf need? Who asked you? I hate hats. And that's why you decided to hate Christmas? Why get your hopes up if all you get is disappointed? What's there to be disappointed about when you're surrounded by such a smurfy family? More like an annoying family. I could have used that hang glider to y away for some peace and quiet. Well, if you wanted to fly, then let's go. You've got somewhere to be. Hey! Oh, man. You are heavier than you look. Sorry! I'm new at this. Hey! Wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie! Watch where you're going! Sorry! I hate falling! Nice of you to drop in. Brainy? I'm afraid you are incorrect in your assumption, for I am the Smurf of Christmas present. Then where are the presents? I'm hers to show you how your hatred of Christmas is going to affect the whole village. What are you talking about? Every Christmas, I would just put up a couple of decorations. And Papa would make mo put a Mar on top of the tree. Every action, no matter how small, has a reaction. Behold! Because you decided not to help decorate the tree, Chef had to step in and help with the ornaments instead of baking his traditional gingersmurf cookies, which had an exponential effect on the rate of Christmas cheer per Smurf that when multiplied by the square root of total chaos to the... Grouchy, why do I bother? Just watch. I have more Christmas decorations. Oh, the star for the top of the tree. Oh, but Grouchy isn't here. Hey! Hey, I'll take care of it. - No, Clumsy. - No, no, no! - The stockings! - The stockings! Well, at least the fire's out. No! Out of the way, Smurfs! This wouldn't have happened if Grouchy were here. Every Smurf plays an Important pan, you no? Yeah. I see. Not yet, you don't. There we are. Now It's just the way Greedy likes It, with a little pocket inside to keep extra smurfberries. And Tailor will be delighted with the extra-large built-in pin cushion. Papa makes all of our hats himself? And crafts each one to meet the particular needs of every Smurf. Takes him all year. Grouchy, I've made a hat I know you'll love, if only you'd give it a chance. Well, maybe this year. Papa, I didn't know. He can't hear you. It's time to go. Hey, Brainy! Where did you go? Brainy, is that you? Sorry, bro, just finishing up the holiday fruitcake. But I already know your feelings on that. - Hefty? - Oh, not Hefty, you lump of coal. I am the Smurf of Christmas future. And the future is... This? This is the future? In a manner of speaking. It's tomorrow. It's Christmas Day. Christmas Day? Then where is everyone? They all left this morning. They wanted to do something to help you get your Christmas spirit back. I know what would make Grouchy happy. How about we all go get a new tree in the morning? One of the huge smurfy ones from the west forest. - That'll cheer him up. - That's a great idea. - For Grouchy. -Let's do It for Grouchy. This will make everyone happy. And what happened? They never came back. Never came back? What do you mean? The west forest. Smurfette! Brainy! Clumsy... Need to do more cardio, bro. Brainy wouldn't go anywhere without these. Where are they? No! Gargamel's lair. It can't be. It can, actually. What about the others? I thought you were going to take me to the others. Oh, I have. Oh, no. All of them. They were all captured. Trying to make me happy. When Papa came looking for them, Gargamel got him, too. I've been so selfish. Well, on the bright side, looks like you'll all get to spend one last Christmas together after all. Merry Christmas to me! Hefty! Hefty! I see you've met Santa Claws. You are going to look great on top of my tree. Help! Oh, no! No! It can't end like this. I can change! I can change. I can change. I can change. Where am I? I'm back and I'm alive. It's not Christmas morning yet. There's still time to set things right. What is that? - Oh! - Whoa! - That's incredible. - Look at this. Well, well. Look who's finally up. Grouchy, you did all this? I even baked a fruitcake. And I was wrong. Christmas isn't a time for hating. That's what all the other days are for. I was so busy focusing on what I wanted that I didn't see the real gift was having a family that cares, even though I'm Grouchy. Merry Christmas. I know it's not the hang glider you always asked for, but I made it just for you. Thanks, Papa. A new hat! Oh, I made it for all of us. Merry Christmas, everyone. - Yeah. Merry Christmas. Hey, wait a mlnute. If Papa knew I wanted a hang glider... Remember, it's just for you. Merry Christmas, everyone. Oh, no. I hate snow. And I hate being cold, and I hate carrots. But most of all, I hate that Christmas is only once a year. Smurf the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la la la la la! Merry Christmas.
