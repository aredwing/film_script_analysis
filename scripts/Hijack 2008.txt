That's just a decoy. And Rashid? Sir, everyone is here. They are waiting for you. The chiefs of all the three services and the police as well. What about Kumar? Has he come? - Yes, sir. He's waiting for you upstairs. - Yes. Thank you. Yes, please sit down. Please sit down. Good morning, everybody. And allow me to introduce to you, Mr. Rajesh Kumar... who is from our counter terrorist unit. And he is handling Rashid Omar's case. Mr. Rajesh Kumar, please begin. - Sir. Gentlemen, Rashid Omar, the mastermind... of an international terrorist group... They tried to get him released today morning but were unsuccessful... The leader of this group is someone called Abdullah. We don't have much information about him. But this man, Rashid... is the brain behind... many of the terrorist activities across the world. London, 300 people killed; Paris, suicide bombing. Bali, attack on the consonant. Really, the list is endless. - Should we encounter him, if you agree? - No. It's very important to keep him alive. Through him, we have to find out what their... future plans are, so that we can fail them. In prison, whenever he is asked why he does all this... what he wants, he has just one answer. Watch this. Abdullah will tell you everything at proper time! For now, get this very clear that one day... we'll rule the entire universe! Today we have decided that we'll take him... to the Narco-analysis cell in Bangalore... where he'll be given the drug to tell the truth... and his brain will be mapped too... with which we'll get to know all their secrets. What's the problem then? Sir, the problem is that this will be done three days from now. And till then, these people will surely attempt something. After looking at the courage of today's attempt... it clearly shows that they don't lack funds, sir. And these people can do anything in order to get Rashid released... In fact, their next attempt could be even more dangerous, sir... And, maybe successful too. " Wonder who's in control. What's going on? " " You can't see the future, so keep walking " - " Hijack. - See your world is burning " - " Hijack. - Feels like hopes are burning " - " Hijack. - Now your time is ticking " - " Hijack. - Are you feeling lonely? " - " Hijack. - The traveller doesn't know " - " Hijack. - What's going on? " - " Hijack. - We're the travellers " - " Hijack. - What's going on? " " Hijack. Hijack " - Hey, where are you going? - Where will I go? I've been looking for this Vicky since morning. I just saw the engineer going towards the remote apron. He must be with his stupid plane! I am at the remote apron. Tell me on my behalf that that plane has not moved... even by an inch in the last 10 years! Are you coming to the party? Get a nice gift for me! I'll get it, you fatso! Okay, bye! - Vicky! Vicky! - Here! Why are you always lying here? I'm telling you, this plane is useless. It's a dead plane. You have to die in order to acquire heaven. What say, fatso? Heaven. You wait and watch. One day I'm going to make this plane fly. - Pass me the wrench. - Wrench. I am the security chief over here... and you're making me a mechanic? Here. - What's this? - Invitation card. - Are you getting married again? - Are you mad? - I'll have to die for that. - Why? You just said that if you want to acquire heaven... you'll have to die. Why are you spoiling your wedding anniversary... by inviting me? I knew. I knew you'd say this. But Neena! Women think they're always right. She sent me with the card. Okay, listen, how many years has it been... since you got married? - 9. - 9 years. That's why. - Are you going towards the hangar? - Yes. - Then go. - Hey you! Okay, listen, you have to come to the party. Be ready, I'll come to pick you up. - Okay? No excuses! Bye! - See you! Come on, hit him! Yes, very good! Come on, hit him! Come on! Yes! Push him! Come on! Good! Come on! Yes! Come on! Throw him! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hey, come on! Faster! Faster! Move ahead! Very good! - Move ahead! Move ahead! - Beat him! - Greetings. - Greetings. - Is everything alright? - Yes, sir. Everything is alright. Anything else? Yes. Yes. - Greetings. - Greetings. Hello. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes. Alright. What's the matter? Why are you so tense? Is everything fine? It's Abdullah's order to activate mission 'Parinda'. And we have just 3 days. - But sir, just three days? - I know, the work is difficult... and we have very less time. But we'll have to do it, right? Sir, we've already lost Faizal, Irfan and Malik. We have just Shakeel and Altaf left as our strong points. Both Abdullah and I are aware of this. If this work is not done in three days... then it'll be too late. Do one thing; tell Shakeel and Altaf that we're coming. And what they were supposed to do tomorrow... they have to do it today. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Come on. - Hey guys, come on. Come on! - Ask your dad. - He will not allow. - It's a free ticket. - But he will not allow. Girls! Why are you sitting here? You're so boring, girls! Let's have fun! Come on! Purab, she has a problem again! What did you do now? - I didn't do anything. - Not he! Her dad's problem! - That's it? - Okay, I'll take someone else. I am not going to waste my free ticket, please. - Bingo. - Just kidding! Neha, you won't have any problem. Your brother is going with you. - But dad will never allow me! - Idea! Do you have a computer at home? What has computer... Do you have a computer at home or not? - But computer... - Yes or no? - No. - Okay, now listen to the plan. You need a computer in order to complete... your college project, right? Neha has a computer at home. Tell your mom and dad that you are going to... Neha's house for 3 days. And when we'll be enjoying there... her parents will think that she is in her house. How's that? - Great! - Not bad! - Yes... - Alright, come. Let's enjoy. People in the house! Welcome to Blackout! We have a special performance for you tonight! Put your hands together for a beautiful Brazilian bombshell! Maria!

If you don't release Rashid Omar immediately... in Hazrat, then we will blast your entire nation. That's why, it'll be better for your nation... and its people if you listen to us. Your well-wisher, Abdullah. Sir, they've sent the copies of this e-mail... to all the leading newspapers... and leading news channels. By the way, Mr. Kumar, where did this e-mail come from? Well, sir, it has come from some internet cafe in Kazakhstan. Our team is trying to find out who has sent this e-mail. Sir, the TV and press reporters have gathered outside. Everyone wants to know whether we are going to release Rashid or not... We cannot release Rashid. This is against our principle. You're right, sir. And even if we release him... it might still not be the end of it. Ms. Simone, the media can be very useful to us at present. Just ask them not to exaggerate the issue. People should not panic. And one more thing, Ms. Simone. Tell them everything without telling them anything, alright? Yes, sir. Okay that's good, Kumar. - This plane is for pre-flight inspection. - Okay. Inspect its start board wing, right landing gear and port wing. Alright, sir. - And top its engine oil up. - Alright, sir. Alright. - Hello. - Betty bought a bitter butter... to make the bitter butter better! Betty bought some bitter butter bitter... You lose! You lose! You lose! - How's my daughter? - Papa, I'm fine. Okay, tell me why I called you. There's surely some good news. - Wrong! - Wrong? Yes! Wrong! Not good news but great news! Then tell me quickly. I won't! You guess! Come on, come on! - You came first in class? - Half right, half wrong. Half right, half wrong... you've topped the school! Right! After all, you're my papa! And papa, I've been selected for... the interschool quiz contest! And we're going to Amritsar the day after! - And do you know how we're going? - How? By air! And teacher Neeta told us... that our plane will pass through your airport! Do wave out to me! Dear, but from such a height... forget me, even the airport won't be visible. Still wave out to me! I'll see! Okay, bye, papa! - Bye! Bye! - Yes, Priya... Priya! Listen, dear! - Yes. - Don't be mischievous on the flight. Always tie your seatbelt. - And if you need anything... - Yes, yes papa. I know. I'm not a little baby! I'm a big girl now! Don't worry, papa. I'm a big girl now! Of course, you're a big girl now. And yes, take care of yourself. Heat food before eating! Okay, bye, papa! Bye! - I love you, dear. - Love you, papa. I love you. Is this blast related to the release of Rashid? We have taken the action that we should. You know that Rashid's outfit is responsible for this blast. We have found out where this mail has been sent from. Now the counter terrorist squad is... trying to find out where these people are operating from. Everything is under control. Culprits will be brought to book. There is no reason to panic... And no further comments. - Madam! - Madam, one question. You just heard what the government has to say. Now we want to show you some pictures of... the bomb blast so that you can understand... the seriousness of the issue. This is Rupali Shah, Zee news. The pictures that you see are very shuddery. - Philu! Philu! - What is it? What's the matter? You keep calling out to me the whole day! Please get my inhaler. I can't find it. Of course you can't find it. It's kept next to you. You'll be able to see it only when you wear your specs. Simple! Then... then at least get my specs. Oh God! What's wrong with you? Your specs are with you! Will you wear it or should I wear it for you? - No, I'll wear it. I'm not that lazy. - Yes, I know. You do no work! I know what you are! Listen, just tell me if you're going to wear this shirt or not. To hell with your shirt! Get me my inhaler. I can't breathe! Oh my! The inhaler is kept right next to you. Hold it. You want me to pump it... for you or will you manage it yourself? - No, I know how to pump it. I'll do it. - You'll pump it. He just keeps calling out to me the whole day! - Philu. - What is it? What is it now? - Hurry up! - Philu, I love you! What love? Let me do my work! Abdullah has informed that... the security has been tightened everywhere. That's why all of us must take different routes. Some of us might also have to sacrifice... their lives in order to make this mission a success. God willing. But I promise, the day only we will rule... this world, the name of every martyr... will be written in bold letters. We're going for our mission! Success is waiting for us. - God is watching us! - Success is ours! God is great! - Success is ours! - God is great! - Hey, gorgeous! Look who's here! - Hi! Rajeev, why are you so late?

Whenever I come here... the most beautiful girl over here comes and sits next to me. - Excuse me? - Me? You have come and sit here. I have been sitting here since quite a long time. What's happening? Nowadays she comes and sits beforehand. Did you know that I was going to come and sit here? Do you start a conversation like that with every girl? Just for the special one. But you just said that whenever you come in here... all beautiful girls come over here and sit next to you? Actually, you know what, you just got me! I did. But I guess that's what makes you the special one. - Vikram. - Pooja. - Are you in a hurry? - Yes. I am already late. Somebody is waiting for me. It's not good to keep your husband waiting. And who ever told you I'm married? Well, husband, boyfriend, whatever. - You never give up, do you? - Never. - Can I call you? - Yes. Number!

All of you one by one go to economy class. Come on, move. Move fast. Move! Move fast! Come on! - Excuse me, is this a joke? - I said move! Listen, I paid for business class.

Talk to the captain and ask him to open the door quickly. Make him open the door! Quickly! This isn't working. I said get the door opened! Okay. Okay! Just a moment! They shouldn't know of this. Normal! Good morning, captain. Sarika. I have brought your tea, sir. Can I come in the cockpit? Thank you, Sarika, you can come inside. Who is the captain of this flight? I am. I asked; who is the captain of this flight? You, sir. Now do as I say. - If you make mistake then... - No, sir. I mean, yes sir. Take this flight to Dubai. Sorry sir, I don't have authorisation. We don't need you if you can't take this flight to Dubai. No, no, sir. No. I will take this flight wherever you want. - Please, sir. Please. Please. - Good. Sir, what I meant was we don't have enough fuel to fly to Dubai. Not enough fuel, sir. - Which is the nearest airport? - Chandigarh, sir. Easy day, guys. There are just two flights? This is CJ142. Request permission to land at your airport. This is CJ142. Request permission to land at your airport. - This is CJ142... - Just hold this. Request permission to land at your airport. Negative, CJ142. You are not scheduled to land here. - Sir... - Listen to me very carefully. This plane has been hijacked by us. And we want to land at your airport. If we don't get the permission to land within 10 minutes... then we will start killing the passengers in this flight. What rubbish is this? Is this some kind of a joke? Request, authenticate user identity. I repeat, request authenticate user identity. I want to talk to the pilot. - Come on, speak to him. - He... he is right, sir. We have a hijack situation onboard, sir. Keep recording. Keep rolling. Keep rolling... He has already killed two people. And captain Singh as well, sir. Please do as they say, sir. Please. - Or else they will... - One more thing. We will need some fuel. So make arrangements to make our tanks full. Or else unnecessarily I will have to use blood instead of fuel. And I don't like killing people. Hello. Hello CJ142, come in... do you read me? CJ142! CJ142, come in. Goddamn it! Shucks! This is ridiculous. - Put the airport on red alert. - Yes, sir. - Kuljeet. - Yes, sir. Get me Rajeev on the line immediately. - Okay. - Karan. - Yes, sir. - Contact Delhi immediately. Clear runway 15 for landing and docking. Divert traffic to 19. And yes, fire brigade. Keep the fire brigade on standby.

Flight CJ142 has been hijacked. And it wants to land at our airport for refueling. - Did you get that? - Sir. Yes... so be ready and standby for my orders, okay? Oh my God, sir which flight number did you say it was? Flight CJ142 Delhi to Am... let it be any flight! What difference does it make, Rajeev! The point is that the flight has been hijacked! Now standby for my orders and report when you're in location! Out! Joseph, get ready for an emergency landing. - Sir, engine failure? - It's not an engine failure. - It's a forced landing. - Sir. - Ambulance and fire brigade on standby. - Okay, sir. - Fatso, where are you going? - Vicky, there's been a hijack. - Hijack? Which flight? - CJ142. Rane, come in. Come in, Rane. - Which flight? - CJ142. Delhi to Amritsar. - Hello, Rane. - Rane, listen to me. - Yes, sir. - Everything should be ready. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. - What happened? - Priya is in that flight. Oh no. ATC has just informed me that... that flight is going to land at our airport for refueling. - Rajeev, come in, Rajeev. - Yes, sir. Rajeev, report to the security cabin immediately. Sir, on the way, sir. Yes. I am there, sir. Yes. Vicky, you stay here. I will go to the security cabin and come back. 'We have to land this plane. Do you hear me'? 'We have to land this plane'. 'Sir... sir... What's going on? Tell me, what's going on'! 'Captain Madan, maintain protocol'. - 'You will be landing in 3 minutes'. - 'Sir... - Runaway number 8 is clear to land. - Sir'... 'And we have the commandos in position'. 'What's happening, Vibhat? What's happening outside'? 'Tell me Vibhat, what's happening outside'? - 'Take over. - Captain, our commandos are in position'. 'Don't let anyone enter the cockpit'. 'As soon as the plane will land... our commandos will take over the plane'. 'And for God's sake please, don't try doing anything heroic'. 'Move, Vibhat'! 'Pooja! Pooja'! 'Pooja! Pooja'! 'Pooja'! 'Pooja! Pooja'! Ask the pilot to keep giving us the fuel status. Monitor altitude of aircraft, give me the passenger list. And get me the head office on line too. Quick! - Excuse me, sir. - What is it? Can't you see I am busy? I don't even have time to talk to you. Got it? I don't think you understand what problem we are facing. Sir, I know. I'm just trying to say... What happened to the fuel status? That I might be able to help you, sir. Vikram! It's not a technical problem! - We have a hijack situation on hand. - I know, sir. I just came to tell you that we shouldn't... take the situation in our hands, sir. We should call the commandos so that... So that the terrorists get a perfect excuse to kill our passengers. Let me do my job, okay? Now get out of here! - What happened to the head office? - Connecting, sir. - Hello, Rajesh Kumar here. - Good afternoon, sir. This is the ATC chief Arminder Singh... from the Chandigarh airport, sir. We have an emergency. Flight CJ142 has been hijacked, sir. And they want to land at Chandigarh airport for refueling. What? Is the information verified? Affirmative, sir. I have spoken to the co-pilot. And I have also spoken to one of the hijacker. We have recorded the conversation. They have already killed the pilot. We have very little time. You tell me, what are the orders for me, sir. Okay fine, just give me a minute. I will get back to you. And listen, just stay by the phone. Sir, hello! Hello, sir! Virun! Hello. Send one in. Boom! Sir, I'm sorry, sir. - Come on. - I'm sorry, sir. - Come on. - Sir, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir. Sir, please. - Sir, sorry. - Sir, please. - Come on. - Sir, please, sir. - Come on! - Hey! - HEY!... - I'm sorry, sir. - I'm really sorry, sir. - Come on! Sir, please, please, leave me, sir. - Come on! - I'm sorry, sir! - Sir, please! - Come on! Please! Puru! - Puru! Puru! - HEY! - Puru! Puru! Puru! - Neha! Puru! Puru! Puru! Puru! I say we shouldn't let them land. For how long will they fly? They will come to their senses by the time their fuel gets over. And when they will see their death approaching... These people aren't scared of death. They are suicide bombers. They are always ready to die. Give me the update on the fuel status. Quick. Looks like you guys didn't pay attention to what I said. Or else I would have reached a call by now. No... sir, I was just about to call you. Well, I have spoken to my seniors in Delhi. And they are talking with the ministry, sir. You guys waste a lot of time talking. You don't understand that they... can get out of hand while talking. No sir, just give us some more time. Please. I'm true to my word, sir. I had said if I don't get a positive responsive... within 10 minutes then you will be responsible for the next casualty. No look, you try and understand. I... I'm just doing my duty. You... I can understand but your seniors don't understand. No sir, you listen to me! Now you have another 10 minutes. Neha... Puru... Let the plane land in Chandigarh. Once the plane is on ground, it will be easier for us to talk to them. We can send a few capable people to negotiate with them. I agree. Once they are on the ground they will... at least not kill more people. Let them land. And refuel. But, we must not let them take off. Thank you very much for listening to me. Or else I wonder how many more people I would have to kill. And yes, if I see any commandos or snipers... anywhere in and around the airport... No sir, we have not called for any commandos or security. - Trust me. - Good. Now get us refueled with the same efficiency. Okay. They are already on standby. - I will send them right away. - Good. I'm impressed. For your cooperation I give you my word... that as soon as our tanks get refuelled... I will release a few passengers of yours. - And I keep my word. - Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. You're welcome. Vicky? K.C., K.C. - Philu... - K.C. - K. C... - Philu, it's over. Oh God, why did it have to get over now? Don't worry, darling. Don't worry. - I have a new one in my bag, I'll get that. - Stop! - Please. Sit down. - Hey, please. Please. Just a moment, let me remove the inhaler. Can't you hear me? I said please sit down. Hey, can't you see? He can't breathe. He will die if I don't give him the new inhaler. If you won't listen to me then you will die. - Is that clear to you? - Please son. Please, son. - Shut up! Otherwise... - Otherwise what? Otherwise what? You want to kill me? You want to shoot me? Kill me! I will take it out, no one can stop me! Got it? Do as you please! K. C... K. C... K... Next time if you move from your seat then I will kill you. - Sir... sir... - Why are you calling out to me? Can't you see that we are surrounded with guns? - Sit here quietly. - Sir, how can I sit here quietly? This is a golden opportunity to make use of. - I hope you understand. - What are you trying to say? I think this situation has made you go crazy, Pandey. Here our lives are at risk and you are calling it a golden opportunity? I'm right, sir. This is the right time. Try to get this situation under control. - Show some courage. - What are you trying to say? Elections are around the corner. A lot can happen if you show a little courage. - Understood? - Let me see if I get a chance. Look for an opportunity and then go for it! Sir... This... what is this? You had promised me that you will release a few passengers. I have. I had promised that I will release a few passengers. I have kept my word. Now whether they are dead or alive... What is it that you want? Tell me, why are you killing these innocent people? Patience, my friend. Patience. I'm sure you must have got the ministry online as well by now. So that I don't have to repeat myself. Yes, yes, we are on the line. We can hear you, loud and clear. That's a new voice I hear! Can I know whom am I talking to? This is Rajesh Kumar speaking from counter terrorist unit. Counter terrorist unit. But we aren't terrorists. We are just plain and simple businessmen. And we have brought a profitable deal for you. Why don't you just tell us what do you want? From past 3 months you have my elder brother... Rashid Omar as your guest. You should send him back to us. We will take him back home. That's all I want. Look, Rashid is a terrorist. It's not in my hands to release him. Then speak to the one who can do it! I will call back exactly after half an hour. To get an affirmative reply from you. Oh come on, this is ridiculous. I have to talk to my superiors. Give me some more time. You can take as much time as you want. We have a lot of passengers. But remember, the count of passengers... will decrease by one every half an hour. Shit! - I will need your help, please. - Who are you? What are you doing here? I want to go there and take a seat. - Which seat? - 15A. Whoever you are, go away from here, please. Please. I need your help. Listen to me. Why don't you understand? I have come here to help you all. Don't waste time. Just do it. These people are very dangerous. I hope you know what you are doing. Come on. 'We just got the news that the flight from Delhi to Amritsar... CJ142 has been hijacked and... has been force landed at Chandigarh airport'. 'Along with a few passengers the terrorists... have killed the pilot of the flight, Captain Singh, too'. Look mama, papa's photo is on TV! 'Our team has arrived in Chandigarh'. 'But they have been stopped from going inside'. Mama... - Hey, what happened, mama? - 'The situation is quite tense'. 'As soon as we get more information'... You tell me the name, it has 1000... - Just a moment, dear. - What is it? - Please! - Father's plane has been hijacked. - Papa, what's the name of this, please? - What? 'With whom we are going to discuss this whole issue'. Hey! Stop! - Where are you going? - Bathroom. Did you ask? Did you ask? Did you ask me? No one will move from their places without asking me! Why did you move? Tell me, what you were doing! Tell me! Do you want to see what I do to... the one who doesn't listen to me? Why are you shouting so much, shoot him! No, I was going to the bathroom. - Papa? - Please. - Please. - Get up! You scoundrel. Please leave me! No, no, no. I was just going to the bathroom. What have I done? Please, don't... don't shoot me. - Please, I'm sorry. - Shut up! Please leave me. Please. Please. Leave me. - No... no. - Shut up! No, no, no! Please. No! No! No! No! No! No! Excuse me, sir. Sir, my name is Umashankar Tiwari. And I'm a very senior leader in the opposition party. Tell me, what can I do for you? Look sir... I can help you get your demands. You just get me in touch with the government officials. And sir, I will make them realise... that our safety lies in agreeing to your terms, sir. O really? Do you have so much faith in yourself? Yes sir, you just give him a chance. - He can do wonders. - Okay, come. Why hasn't Sajid come back as yet? - Go and check. - Okay. He will kill us all if he finds out. He will kill us all. Saira! Saira, get a grip on yourself! - Get a hold on yourself. - What have you done! You killed him! Now he will kill all of us. Saira, listen to me very carefully. I'm taking him down and you go there. When they will ask you where he is, tell them the truth. Tell them that I have killed him and... have gone down with his dead body. No, please. Please... don't make me do this. My daughter is on seat number 12G. Priya. You go... you go and tell her that I'm alive. Go and tell her that her papa is alright, please. Now go ahead and do it. Just act normal. Normal? How can I act normal? - I'm... I'm scared. - But that's okay. In this situation that's normal. I think you didn't understand what I told you. Or maybe I couldn't make you understand properly. So this time I have brought someone who... will be able to make you understand. Hello. Home Minister, I'm Umashankar Tiwari. Look, these guys have got guns. And if you don't listen to them then they'll start killing people. And if that happens then I'm going to raise... hell in parliament and you'll find yourself in trouble. You know that I belong to the opposition. I'll turn your life into hell. Mr. Tiwari, you're a political leader and yet... you're helping out these terrorists. Mister, I'm not helping out terrorists, I'm... helping out the people who're aboard this plane. I'm supporting their family. Are you getting me? Mr. Tiwari, you know that Rashid is a terrorist. How can we let him go? This is against our policy. Very good. Brilliant. Home Minister, you are bragging about... policies and all, while sitting in an air conditioned room. You're telling me how to make cottage cheese... by adding lime in it? Are you teaching me politics? We are not just sitting out here. This is a serious matter and we are trying... our best to solve it. Ask them to grant us more time. And also ask them not to rush. Look, mister, er... he says that... I heard it. What do you say? Look, mister, I say that, you grant them some time. You didn't get me? He'll have to listen to you. But grant him some time. - You control everything here. Getting me? - Yes. Now you have only got half an hour. Because you know that every half an hour... - These people are brave. - Brave and stupid. Have they refused to let go Rashid? They didn't refuse, but they're not obeying either. They are just going over discussion and buying time. Why can't they take this petty decision? Brother, I say that let's kill They'll get the message. - Priya. - Water. - Priya, listen. - Water. If she is here then where is Sajid? Priya, your papa is fine. Nothing is wrong with him. Priya. - He'll save us all. - Promise? I promise. Sure. Papa... Tell me, where are those two? How do I know? I didn't go anywhere. You know everything! Come on, tell me, where are they? I told you. I don't know. Will you answer me properly or shall I slap you? Hit me. Beat me. What else can you do? Kill us all. But he won't spare you. He has killed him and taken him downstairs, in cargo hold. If you have guts, go and see him. He's going to kill all of you. Altaf. He won't go there. You need guts to go there. Wait. - Take her with you. - Come on. Come on! Move it! Where is it? This one? Unlock it. Open it! Open it! Come on, open it! If we release Rashid because of their threats... then this will be a great mistake on our part. If we accept their demands for once then... it will become a precedent. They will do it for every prisoner. Then we should probably stop catching these terrorists. People's lives are in danger over there. No one will forgive us if we let them die... despite the fact that we could save them. So you're saying that we should let go Rashid? Yes, what's the problem, Mr. Kumar? Do you think terrorism will cease to exist... just because we won't let go Rashid? So disband our department! If this is how you release someone then... why should our officers put their lives in danger... and get hold of them... Mr. Kumar, control yourself! This is not the time to get emotional. Sir, then what should we do? Shall we accept defeat? This is not about defeat or victory. This is about bringing our people back home. Alive. - Home Minister! - Shame! Shame! - Home Minister! - Shame! Shame! - Home Minister! - Shame! Shame! - Home Minister! - Shame! Shame! - Home Minister! - Shame! Shame! - Home Minister! - Shame! Shame! - Home Minister! - Shame! Shame! - Home Minister! - Shame! Shame! - Home Minister! - Shame! Shame! And you can see that the public is getting out of hand. What the public wants to know is that, is one... terrorist more important than 192 passengers? The life of these passengers are... It will be sensible if we agree to their terms... by looking at the situation. We might catch him in the near future. We have caught him before, so we'll nab him again. Okay, sir, as you wish. But still for the record, I would... Enough, Mr. Kumar! Yes, Altaf? This girl was right. That infidel has killed Sajid. - Don't spare him. - Yes, sir. - Sajid was my brother. - I know, brother. Now I won't spare that infidel. Come on! Declare that we're releasing Rashid to save our people. Our first duty is towards the safety of our own citizens. Pick up the phone and tell him that you've killed me. Tell him! Tell him! Brother. Altaf, they have agreed to release Rashid. Brother, I have killed them both. I'll come upstairs after disposing of the bodies. And brother Sajid. What should we do with Sajid? Bring him upstairs. We'll take him along. I'll bring Sajid upstairs... It's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't have a choice. My daughter is up there. I don't have a choice. Saira, you must go back up again. There are 3 terrorists remaining. One of them is in cockpit. Two are in economy. You must go back again and help... Stop it! Why should I help you? I don't even know you. Who are you? Saira, I'm maintenance chief of this airport. And I know everything about this plane... Maintenance chief! This is not a bloody maintenance problem. These guys are terrorists and this is a hijack situation. Do you even know what a bloody hijack is? Do you even know what a hijack means? Saira, I'm Vikram Madhan, pilot of IC 214. Vikram Madhan? IC 214? - It was... - Yes. But you told me that, you're maintenance... After that day... Captain Vikram Madhan, you've violated the rules of... aviation by opening the cockpit door in the... event of a hijack situation. Until the inquiry reaches any conclusion, the director... general of civil aviation cancels all your flying... licences with immediate effect. 'I couldn't answer myself that the decision which... I made that day was right or wrong'. 'I wonder why life has brought me to the same situation'. 'I just know that Priya, my daughter who was my... biggest weakness has become my biggest strength'. I won't let anything happen to Priya. All of you people will be happy to know that... your government has agreed to our demands. I express my gratitude to all of you who... helped us in achieve our goals. We are not your enemies. As soon as our brothers will reach here we'll let you go. - Excuse me. - No. Please, please, excuse me. - Sir, please. - Sameer. Sir. Sir, as they're fulfilling your demands. And your brothers are going to be here... you should at least release women and children. - You want to go? - Of course, sir. Not only me, but all of us would like to go. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, please clap for this man. Because this is the first men whom we'll let go first. Shakeel, let him go through back door. - Can we go? - Yes. - Congrats. - Thanks. Thank you. Sameer! Sameer! Sameer! Leave him! Leave him! Sameer! Sameer! " You don't know what'll happen tomorrow? " " Who knows what those moments will bring us?

" " O' Lord, show us the way. " Let him go. After you. Why? You are free now? What are you afraid of? Afraid? I was never afraid, Mr. Kumar. But one must be careful when it comes to one's life. How can I trust you after all? You might blow this plane in midair. We wouldn't let you go if we wanted this to happen. But still, you must come with me because I say so. Because when we'll let go passengers... I'll keep you with me until I make it to my home. Mr. Kumar, you have taken care of me... so give me a chance to serve you. Come on! - Hello. - Hello. Sir, this is Simone. Sir, we have a situation. Rashid has taken Kumar with him. What? Why? Sir, as a substitute for the hostages. Substitute for the hostages? I know. Even I'm not getting this. - Oh Simone. - Yes, sir. - Do one thing. - Sir. Send an e-mail to Abdullah saying that Kumar... - has left with Rashid. - Okay. So please don't kill anymore passengers. Right away, sir. - Vicky. - Hello. Rajeev, where were you? I'm trying to call you for a long time. Vicky, where are you right now? I'm in cargo hold. We had a five terrorist over here. I have killed two of them. But now they know about me. Okay. Vicky, listen to me. Just hide in there. All their demands have been met. And their man has been released. They are going to land here in few moments. Mr. Kumar, who is chief of our counter terrorist... unit is coming with him. No, no, Rajeev, you can't trust these people. They are still killing hostages despite the... fact that their demands have been met. Listen to me very carefully. Smuggle a gun to that man from counter terrorist. Okay. And ask him to shoot the man near him... as soon as I signal him. But, Vicky, what if something goes wrong? Rajeev, you just get a gun to him. Okay. Okay, Vicky. - Where is Altaf? - He hasn't come back yet. Altaf, what are you still doing down there? Altaf's soul has already departed... but his dead body is still down here. Shall I send him up? What did you do? I wonder what they will do now. You talked about some plans on the phone and now... Saira, we have no idea if he will get him a gun or not. We must get on with our plan. You must bring them back to rear economy... so that I will make it to the cockpit. And I think I saw later on I saw only one man... Vikram Madhan, maintenance chief, Chandigarh airport. Date of birth, 19th April, 1976. I hope I'm not disturbing you. I was passing through passage and I... saw a cute little girl. Pretty sweet smile. She looks even prettier when you talk to her. Want to talk to her? Come on, talk to her. - Papa! - Priya! Priya, are you alright? Come, upstairs! What happened to Priya? - Vikram. - It's over. - Vikram? - No, it's not over. This happened with you before, right? And then your daughter became your strength. Today that time has come when your daughter... will become your strength again. Vikram, just remember, she is your strength. She is not your weakness. What nonsense? Do you know what you are saying? - I told you the truth. - I can't believe it. Rajesh Kumar and Abdullah. Yes, sir. I have positive confirmation from chief of the... cyber crime unit that all the e-mails sent from Abdullah... originated from Kumar's computer, and... there is no doubt about it. But all those e-mails were sent from a cyber cafe... situated in Kazakhstan. Sir, whatever mails that I have sent to Abdullah have ended... up at Kumar's computer on his personal laptop. So Rajesh Kumar has left with Rashid? It could be one of their games? Definitely, sir. Sir. We shouldn't allow them to board that passenger plane. I don't think they'll let go any passengers. Oh my god. - You do one thing. - Sir. Inform the ATC chief and tell him that... they shouldn't board the plan. Yes, sir. Hello. Mr. Singh, this is Simone from the home minister's office! All the best. Don't let Rashid and Kumar to board that plane. He is their man and he's with them on this. What? Get me Rajeev on the phone quick! Yes, sir! Rajeev. Hello, Rajeev. Who knows what games they are playing? Sir, he is not responding. Sir, Rajeev online. It's too late. - Greetings, brother. - Greetings to you. It's nice to see you, brother. You haven't changed even in these circumstances. Circumstances doesn't change us, it's vice a versa. Look, we haven't got much time. Just get on with this chief engineer and get lost. I will handle the rest. - Papa. - Dear. Good to see you, maintenance engineer. You've entertained our people so well. I met a real man after so long time. Vicky. Vicky, don't trust this counter terrorist man. Just hide in the cargo hold. I have just given him the gun but I've just received a news... that his real name is not Kumar but Abdullah. And the ministry also told us that he... is with them on this. Don't trust him. Be way of him. Isn't this all a game of opportunities? Vikram! Priya! Back off! Come on, Priya! Come on, Priya. Priya! Go! Just go! Everyone dies some or other day. But you'll die every day after you know that... your daughter is with us. Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! - Come on. Hurry up! - Yes, sir. Priya! Come on, faster. Faster. Take off! Take off! Take off! Take off! Take off! Take off! Yes, Rajeev. Come in. Hurry up! Bring it down! Bring it down! - Come on! - Yes, sir! - Take off! - Yes sir! Take off! Take off! Papa! Papa! Papa! Rashid! Shut up! Shut up! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! " Life is in your shadows. " Papa! " I'm walking on your path. " Everything is fine, dear. Everything is fine. Papa! Papa is fine, dear. You know why? Because I'm your papa. " Stay in my arms forever " Papa! I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, papa. Papa, I'm sorry. Don't worry, sister. You'll be alright soon. We'll come and meet you in the hospital. - Promise? - Promise. - Sure? - Sure. Thank you.
