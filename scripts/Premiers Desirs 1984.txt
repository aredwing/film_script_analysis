Forth past couple of weeks, that's all you've been talking about: Island, mysteries and adventures. You're deserting us! But it's too far... we will never get there. Stop complaining. Come! You don't want to come? No, but be careful. Of course! Helene! Helene! I'm so happy. Helene! You can not imagine how happy I feel. We missed you so much! We were starting to panic and imagining all kinds of stupid things. There were no reason to be frightened. That's pretty. Where did you get it? I found it. Where... in a shop? Don't be silly! We were so worried. We had an awful night. I found your shoe. Yes, but I lost the other one, too. So... Are we going now? Do you think we could borrow a rowboat? Quite shrewd... and very funny... and why not a storm as well! Seriously, I saw a house over there. We could ask for help. Let's go. I already have enough of this island. Do you think we should go this way? Who knows! What are we going to say to the islanders? The truth. They are going to call our parents. I will be the one to call them. Very well, I understand... The holidays are over. But I won't tell anything. I'm not that stupid! I'll tell the truth only to the residents of that house. But I don't want mother to worry, that's all. Don't worry, Helene will take care of everything. Hey! Look over there. Hey. Sir... please... hey! Hey... beautiful day, isn't it? Take care and see you again! Hey... Sir. Stop... Hey, sir! This is the house. Piano music So what do we do? Well... you blow the candle! Let's go, we will come back later. They might not appreciate to be disturbed. Let's go! Caroline, are you coming? Where are you going? Come back! Caroline! Caroline, come. It's enough! Did you like the man of the house? Which man? Don't be silly. Oh yes, I liked him. He is interesting. Caroline, Helene, wait for me! But... what's wrong with you again? Listen... I have two feet and they are killing me. You should have worn more comfortable shoes, you would not have that problem now. Exactly! If we would have asked for help from the pianist and her guy, we would not be in this situation. Sit down. We will call a taxi and will come back, OK? Don't leave! Wait for me! Hurry up! Wait. Hey! We are almost there. You will be able to rest, hurry up! There is a coffee shop, over there, right at the corner. Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! I'm starving! You're not the only one, but I don't have a penny. Wait. Here's ten francs. Let see what you can do with it. Anybody here? Please! Good morning. Good morning. Can you tell me if there is a boat leaving for the mainland? Do you want something to drink? A coffee. And how about the boat? Not before tomorrow morning. Anyway... and how much is a sandwich? With coffee, ten francs. OK. But with a large one? Large. Like this? Like this! I'll get it for you! Very good! Wait a minute, just watch this. Take this, where is Dorothee? She left this way. She does not waste anytime, doesn't she? Ready? Let see how I can play! You hold this for me! OK, please, meet eh... what is your name? Max. And him? Who is he? OK... OK, let me concentrate. Are you sure you know how to play the game? Oh so so. Quiet! Be careful... you know, little holes in these tables will cost you! Chut! I know... I know... Here I go. Wow... wonderful. It's great. My father was a great champion. He taught me how to play. Our apartment is filled with cups and trophies. We had a pool table... but we had to sell it. When I was a child, I was playing under the table while my father played and... my father is dead. Well... how about a little dancing. Yes, let's go. Dorothee, come with us. What do you want to hear? This one... You want this one? OK... There's my brother Etienne. Come... I will introduce you. Etienne, meet Helene. Hi Etienne. This is Dorothee, and the beautiful Caroline. Hello! How did you reach the island? In a boat. Ah! And when? Yesterday. Why? I only want to know... with that storm... We came in just before. And the boat, where is it? On the beach, somewhere. And where did you sleep? At our friends' place... I see. And you will stay there for a while? It depends. Ah! It depends of what? Of one person. And I know that person? I don't know maybe. And that's none of your business. I don't have to answer all of those questions! You know what? Raoul is inviting us on the island. We could stay there! Yes. There are a lot of things to do... Don't worry... let's go... Yes Captain! You know, earlier, I did not tell you the truth. You lied to me? Yes. I don't know anybody on that island. Are you mad at me? No no. You know... I know what? Nothing. Look, we're almost there. Damn it. Look at my dress. That's not my fault. Ah! You... moron. Stop fighting. But it's not my fault. Ok, everything is fine... Dorothee, to whom are those things? These are mine, We have everything. You can bring them all. Take everything, huh? OK. I take my bag there's still a lot to do. Hurry up, Max. Hey, just a minute. Caroline, I lost the bag. I lost the bag. But, which bag? But. THE bag! That's not true... What kind of bag? Like a grain sack! Our fun money. All gone! So, we will have to make a thorough search! Let's go, all together. Don't worry, we will find it. But, do you realize? No but... look at her, what is she doing! Are you going to help us or are you waiting for me to send you a confirmation by fax? No way, don't count on me. I just did my nails and I don't want to ruin them. Back to the boys and girls. Look over there! I'll bet that you're looking for something. Are you making fun of us? Is this what you're looking for? But... where did you find it? That's what we agreed. You told me, if there was a problem, to call your folks with the money. You did it? I did it. I called but there were no answer. We should go now if we want to reach the island before darkness. OK, I'll be with you in a moment. Dorothee, I have a letter for you. Thank you. Hurry up, girls. And, besides that, how do you feel? I'm OK... but the holidays are almost over. It's sad! You're so right. How is the island? It's terrific. I'll tell you more. OK I'm the only one working here. Pierre Albert... Pierre Albert! Yes. I'm working! The children are not in yet, maybe something happened. I'm worried when they are sailing. Don't worry, everything will be fine. What do you say? I said that I don't want to be disturbed under any circumstances! What a jerk! My father built it a few years ago. He used it as a shelter. He does not come here anymore so, the bungalow has been deserted since then. It is pretty. And the sea, just there in front. Did you see her breast? Believe me Max, she is super... Shit! We're stuck here tonight! Oh yes! What? Is you father aware of their presence? Are you crazy... He would show up here right away! Don't worry, he does not come here anymore. Get cracking! Hey Max... Max! What! We will catch up tomorrow! What, tomorrow? Well get laid. Get laid? Free. Free? Tomorrow, we'll get a free screw! What a moron... Ah! Tomorrow we'll get a free screw. Hello! Getting settled? Super! Every modern convenience! What can I say... What you see is what you get! We are leaving, Etienne! There's no rush. Bye bye see you tomorrow. That's it. Ciao. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow, and it's free, hey! Not bad at all! This is for you... No, thanks. You know, I never understood your ship wreck. What did really happen? A man saved my life. Who? Do you remember this couple in the house. I saw them making love, you know, the lady who played piano, it's her husband. Of course! It's him. He carried me in this hut and when I woke up the next morning, I was undressed, and he put my clothes out to dry. And the dress? My skirt and my blouse were torn, he left a dress for me. I'm sure it was him. But why didn't you thank him? I was too embarrassed. He saw me naked. Completely naked! And what about Etienne? He is sweet. The other one... you love him? I can't stand this anymore, it can not go on like this! I'm always alone, that's enough, you must postpone your concert. I can't! Why? Just change the dates on the posters! Julia, just postpone your departure for a few days. Jordan, it's impossible. Just tell me that you don't want to make an effort. You know it's not true. This is your fifth concert this year. I feel married to a piano. Don't be ridiculous, Jordan. I love my career, you know it. And me, you're the one I love. It's not the first time that I leave and it won't be the last. I would not be the same person if I should quit and stay here all day long. I would be a different Julia, a Julia that you might not be in love with. May I? It is yours? I'm not a burglar. It was tempting, I suppose. I saw your house, I heard the music and I... You like music, you're like my towel. See you later. Caroline, Caroline! What do you want? Just wanted to see you... You were not at the bungalow. Yes... and so what? My father is having a party at home. I would like you to come over. OK... I'll be there. But you can not stay here, somebody could come. Go away! Another friend? Oh, please! Any problem? You need a towel? No... you knew very well why I'm here. You wanted to hear some music. You're making fun of me. I came to see... your hut. But if you don't believe me, forget it... Of course, I believe you. I'm inviting you to the Dracula's castle. Come don't stay there shivering. You will be able to listen to all the music you want... and I will fix you a hearty breakfast. Dorothee... Dorothee... Dorothee... I said: Stop. Stop. Dorothee. Leave me alone, I don't want to flirt. Please, leave me alone. OK! You saw that letter from my mother, didn't you? It's easy to understand. She wants to remarry, I'm sorry forth poor man. When I was young, she had two or three lovers, I hardly saw her. But it's normal, she's not going to spend the rest of her life alone. Come, Dorothee. No... Come on... No... you're just like my mother. You disgust me, you have a one track mind. Don't go. Dorothee, listen to me. Wait! No. Listen Dorothee, wait for me. Jordan, can you get me my bath robe please, it's chilly. I called my manager, it's OK. My concert is postponed for two days. Wonderful. I also have a surprise for you. Yes? You will see. Julia, meet... Caroline. Good morning. Please to meet you. I met her on the beach this morning. She collects... beach towels. Welcome. Sit down. You will have breakfast with Jordan, won't you? Julia, won't you stay with us? I'm sorry, I must work but I'll see you later. Hey! Who's that guy? Hurry up. Let's go in the water. Hey! This is this man we saw the last time! Is it good? Very good... I am Etienne and Raoul's father! Ah! Good morning sir! Call me Pierre Albert. It's more pleasant! What? Pierre Al-what? Pierre Albert! We are comfortable here. Thanks forth hospitality. You should thank my sons. But if you want to take advantage of mine, I live around here and I'm having a party next Thursday. You're invited! We will be there! Thank you, sir. I'm counting on you. Yes. Bye girls. See you. Bye Bye! And you, what do you do? Nothing. Nothing at all? Absolutely nothing! I'm a rare breed: I'm billionaire. I own the whole island. The hut too? Where I met you this morning? Where you saw me the first time. Is it yours? I own everything, including the hut. I've decided to live here with Julia. I see you. Here's a friend who loves music. You love music? Some day, I will perform for you alone. But for now, I must work. I'm sorry but I don't want any public for now. We will leave her alone. I will show you something. But what's wrong? Leave me alone. No... Why not? No! Dorothee, come back! No... What's going on. No... Listen, Dorothee... Stop. Open the door. No, I won't, you're a rotten bastard. Listen to me! I will tell everyone who you really are... We didn't do anything... you're the one to blame; you're the one who turned me on. Do you think you will get off that situation so easily? After you messed around with me like this? No way. Why don't you admit that you wanted to go to bed with me. Just like Raoul and Helene. Isn't it so? You're disgusting! Hey... Why don't you say something? Are you still there? Yes. You're just a nasty guy! Dorothee... No! Dorothee... I think I'm in love with you... Liar! No, I don't lie... Is it true? This year, she was very popular: Carnegie Hall, Tokyo, and Paris! C'etait... Oslo I'annee derniere. Why "Drake"? This is her mother's maiden name. I met Julia in Berlin and she was very young. Nowadays, we grow older much faster... and I'm not talking about wrinkles. I was born in Boston, my parents are Americans. "Jordan" is well known in Boston, Your name is "Jordan"? Jordan Jordan. My father's idea. My father had a lot of imagination. This realistic aspect of my family always bothered me. But her, she is, how can I say, elusive. She didn't didn't need to weigh the pros and cons. When I met her, I had everything. Her... next to nothing. Everything amazed her. My life changed totally. I decided I would never leave her despite my family's opposition. My father was going to disinherit me but we came to an agreement. I helped Julia to work more and better. Sometimes, I regret it. Julia is at ease with freedom; she leaves me, she comes back, as if nothing was mattered. As simple as that. I must go now; they will start to worry. Come back tomorrow, if you wish. You can count on me. But what are you doing here? Is there a problem? It's Caroline? You can not understand! Caroline, she likes you. Big deal! She told she came on the island to meet someone else. She's talking nonsense. I know Caroline, she would have told me! You're sure? Convinced! You know, love stories are always the same. Sure, always the same for those who are not in love. Etienne! Did you return? Yes... and I talked to him. About the hut and everything else? Hum! But he acted as if nothing happened. Maybe because of his wife Julia. Oh, he is married? I think, yes. So. What did you talk about? Nothing in particular. His wife was spying on us! I'm sure he doesn't want to upset her, so he keeps a distance, you understand! Hum! Anyway, she is leaving soon. When I left, he begged me to return. It's a good sign. You know... I met a man once, like this one... about the same age. With him, forth first time, I've experienced pleasure. Pleasure? Yes, pleasure. The real pleasure. Two years ago, I went to Spain with my parents. You know Spain? No. I was lonesome... until I met him. He told me an incredible thing. The first time is when you fall in love... Love at first sight... with a teacher, a friend, anybody. You fall for somebody you could meet anywhere. The second time, it's more painful. You're in love and it hurts sometimes. You make love, you hurt each other... And the third time? The third time, it's when you meet somebody who can teach you pleasure, the real pleasure. And how is it, this pleasure? The pleasure... It's like a warm, burning head between your legs, a soft caress, humid which is growing. You always feel you're under the sun even if you're in the shade. It's like... you're never going to die. Come here, Caroline! How are you? Very well, thank you. Jordan is gone for a swim. He will be back soon. I want to apologize... For what? For nothing. Why don't you make yourself comfortable? But I don't have my bathing suit. It is useless. Have you ever been naked on the beach? Even when you were little? Of course... but it is different now! And what for? Lay down next to me and enjoy the sun and the nice weather. Are you shy? No. What are you waiting for? Take off everything! At first, I was more embarrassed than you are. No. I'm sure you were not. Why do you say that? For nothing. Tell me about you. I could help you if I would know a little more about you. Tell me! One day, I went to the doctor for a check-up. He asked me to lie down on a couch. I had to take off my clothes and he looked at me. It was quick but I felt bad. It's a funny feeling but now, I know that I am different from other girls. I don't want to be naked in front of strangers anymore. Nudity is so beautiful. Look at me. I still have a child's tummy. Jordan, the water was good? Mmmm, so, you came back? Why don't you come over here. You will stay with us for a while, won't you? And who is going to go shopping for dinner? I have an idea. Why don't you stay with us for dinner? I don't know. You have an engagement? No. So... you stay with us! Hello girls! I don't see Caroline; is she coming or not? She will meet us later. And Etienne? He went to the store for his mother. He's a mummy's boy! Hey, hey! It's my mother too. What does your father do for a living? He writes. That's not a career! That's what my mother keeps telling him. He is a writer. He is a writer, you know? Just like when you're in an airport, you ask for a book... and you're happy about it... You know, the poor little girl who wants go get married and meet her Prince Charming... Let's go. Yes... hurry up. Come on, let's go. Good morning. Hello Etienne. How are you? Hello! What are you doing here? Three loaves of bread, please. Right away. As you see, I'm buying bread. I would rather say you're spying on me. Not at all... I saw you from outside. Remember my dad's party? It's tonight! Are you coming? No, I won't be there, I have been invited by some friends. But, you promised. I'm sorry but I'm busy. Anyway, I will try. How much is it? Thank you! Goodbye. Hey... you have all you need? Sorry? That's all? My father will pick it up tonight. This time, he will be the one... poor and alone. Excuse me! And every night, he will get dressed as a monkey to perform at a theatre and, like this, he will discover love with the little baroness of Mareuil. Great! It's just great! I count on you... What a pain those parents! With this never ending dinner, I swear. Believe me... I've enough of those chicks. This is hell, you mean... and I do this, and I do that... They really get on my nerves... Hey you guys, what are we going to do? I hope I'm not interrupting! Max and I were waiting. Oh yes? We were talking about you... Have you seen Caroline. Caroline. Caroline. And what else? Etienne, where are you going? I'll be back... Your son is impossible! You are impossible too. Here you go, let's have a drop of champagne, a little more, and who will be happy? It's mommy... I'm never here more than a week. My concerts take up all of my time. America, Europe... now I'm leaving for Caracas. You should come over and say hello to him. I'm sure he will be happy once I'll be gone. And now, here are the razor clams. I have ordered them from Paris, we don't have any on the island. In Venice, we make soup with them with a tomato sauce and mixed herbs. What is it? What are you talking about, darling? The razor clams! On the beach, at low tide, we can see two little holes next to each other in the sand, this is where we must dig and we find the razor clams. There is a more interesting way to find them. We put a bit of salt in each of those holes and after a while, the clam will pop out... because it thought it was the low tide. Ah! Imagination. It is late. I must go. Caroline, Jordan is really fond on you. Don't forget, I would like you to come over as often as you wish when I will be away. You know, he told me everything about your encounter on the beach. When he saw me in the hut? Yes the bathing towel's episode, you remember? Oh yes, thank you and the very best for your in Caracas... I think so. Anyway, I hope so. Goodbye. Goodbye. Caroline! Caroline! Caroline! Caroline! Caroline! Caroline. I have been looking all over for you forth past hour. Leave me alone! You're OK? Leave me alone! What happened? What's it to you. You promised that you would come over tonight. Listen Etienne. I didn't tell you everything. We did not come in before the storm. We were in the boat, the boat sank... and a man saved my life: Jordan. Him? He saved your life? Yes and he loves me, but he doesn't tell me. He is married. What are you talking about, Jordan did not save your life. We were going to call the police... You scared the hell out of me... Let's go back with the others. Tell me, you'll work a little harder, you'll make an effort, won't you? You promise? I promise! Thank you. And be very careful with the sailboat. Regarding my book, it's not finished yet, but almost. Goodbye. Hey... Raoul. Did you see Max? No. You are listening the music? Jordan, why is it so difficult to understand each other? With words, we can only imagine. When you will be far away, I'll imagine what you are doing, and of course, I will be wrong. And when you are closed to me, I'm not as wrong. I will come back. Julia, I only know that I will wait for you. In a few weeks, a boat just like this one will take me back on this same wharf and you will hold me in your arms. You think so? I am positive! Jordan my love... We should not be upset by departures; it is just a matter of time and place. I hate you! Hurry up. What are you waiting for! Hurry up. I'm all mixed up... You will tell me if I forget anything... Give this to your mother. Let's go... Ciao. Ciao... bon voyage! Piano music You learn fast... Please, keep on playing. Are you a musician? No... I just play for fun... Keep playing. Play this note again, again, one more time, again. You know, Julia has left. The last note. Easy on the pedal. She will come back. You must move the brush this way. When will Julia arrive in Caracas? Do you know? She should be there now. Where is Caroline? Couldn't you knock on the door before coming in? I'm asking you if she came back! Listen, I don't want to get involved in your stories anymore. Now, what is going on? She is always with this guy, I can't stand it anymore. I told you it was platonic between them. She is convinced he is the one who saved her life. And? So... I am the one who saved her. That's enough for now, we will complete it tomorrow. Tired? A little. You have paint all over you. Get in the shower! Here's the shower. I'll get you a towel. See you later. Where are the faucets? Here. I'll fix dinner. "... today under the level of six francs. The weather, cloudy and rain tomorrow in half of the northern part of the country... " Jordan? You hear me? Yes! You remember the hut, where I talked to you forth first time. I told you I had seen you before, that I had seen you with Julia... She was playing piano and you kissed her, et then, you made love. Why don't you say anything? What do you want me to say! Did Julia give you this bracelet? Why do you talk so much about my bracelet? Because you had it when you saved me from that ship wreck. What ship wreck? "... Plane crash in Venezuela and among the victims, the world acclaimed renown pianist, Julia Drake. We don't know the exact cause of this tragedy but apparently, the left engine... " When we got to the boat... don't you remember that night? "... According to the companys officials... " For me... it was love at first sight. Jordan? Jordan! You hear me? Jordan? Jordan? ...And the headlines: After 58 days of strike action, the parisian lawyers went back to work today. Economy: The dollar dropped under the level of six francs. Plane crash in Caracas: Among 84 victims, the renown french pianist Julia Drake... " Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Caroline! Etienne! Etienne! Caroline, she didn't sleep in the bungalow! Hurray up, Caroline didn't sleep in the bungalow! Hey Caroline!
