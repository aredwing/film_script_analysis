Uhh, I want to thank Joel and Darla for helping me out, and Tim for letting me play. So, feels like it's been a while. I hope I don't screw this up. Feed me, make yourself proud Fill my mouth up until I drown Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh You pulled me onto dry land Shoved me out with the same two hands, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Ah, ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah We dive in, never come back And each of us has to learn from scratch Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Fuck!

Screw around for a little bit. (Retching) (Spitting) (Groaning) (Speaking Japanese) Oh! (Phone ringing) WOMAN: Brook? Are you there? Pick up the phone. I hope you know we're staying with you for three days. We're excited to see you. WOMAN 2: Tell him I say hi. WOMAN: Mez says hi. Umm, sorry, I didn't want to leave this on your machine. But I don't know, I just don't want you to be surprised. Dad's coming so... Just... Will you call me if you get this? I love you. Okay, bye. (Phone ringing) What's up, Clarke? You answered the phone! What's up, man? It's me, Clarke. I know. Hi, man. Well, I just wanted to, uhh... to let you know that, today, I woke up. And I felt very inspired and motivated to, like, push our career into, like, another level, dude. It's going to be awesome, man. Umm, anyways, so I wanted to go over some bullet points for today's radio interview, dude. Oh, shit, that's today? Yeah. You know I hate doing this kind of stuff. I really don't see the point. Well, as your manager, I think you should really take advantage of this opportunity, dude. Clarke. Yeah? I don't need a manager, man. Oh. I'll just work on some stuff. And then I'll meet you there. Oh my God, thank you so much, Brook. It's going to be awesome, I'm telling you. All right, okay. So, I'll see you there, all right? Okay, cool. Umm, so I'll see you at the radio interview. And just call me if you can't make it 'cause this guy's really, really looking forward to meeting you. And that's it. And I know I'm talking a lot. Sorry, Brook. That's okay. Okay, man. Umm... I'll see you later. I love you. (Beeping) Oh Ah Shivering I am looking in at People that I call my friends Just a silhouette With a cigarette No idea who I am There was soul in these eyes But now they're gone, if only I Held a light in Ah Oh, oh, oh, oh Flashing teeth They are smiling so Happy to burn their time And I don't know when But I lost the will to save her mind Ah! Hey, fuckhead! What's this? A fucking bike lane, isn't it? Have you got a fucking green light? Have you got a green light, man? Oh, look, it's still here, still... Oh, ho! See? That was, like, 35 seconds. So, did you listen to that new Paper Ted album I sent you this morning? Nope. You got to check your email more. This guy is blowing my mind. He's, like, New Wave-ish, kind of like the Nimbles in the early '90s. And this guy has a Master's in Electrical Engineering or something like that. He makes his own sounds, like... (Beatboxing) It's sick. I can't even explain it. Look, I really got to piss. How much time do I have? Five minutes. All right. Hey, I was going to ask you, think you could perform at my art show this Thursday? Man, you know how I am about that kind of stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. You know, it's only a couple songs. It would be, actually, really fast. I just hate playing at art shows, man. People talk too much. Yeah, I hate that. It's annoying. I'm going to be there. I just don't want to play. It's... I'll figure something out. You sure? Yes. Am I sure? Yeah, focus on this. Umm, don't forget to plug Friday's show. I'm going to be listening to you online. And... And, uhh, yeah, man, rock it out. You look good. I'm excited for you. That's all I wanted to... Close the door. There it is, closed. I just gave Canines a re-listen this morning. And it's just... It's just cool to play some honest stuff. You know what I mean? Cool, thanks. Hey, Ronnie, let's get a level on this guy. Will you say something? Uhh, Ronnie, let's get a level on this guy. (Laughing) Okay, here we go, in five, four... It's the underground, it's the underground It's the underground What's up, guys? It's 1:10 on the clock. This is your man Bradley Haines with an instalment of SD Underground, bringing you everything we can dig up about the San Diego indie rock scene. Now, sitting right across from me is a really special guest. You might remember him from a little project he released last year entitled Canines. It came completely out of the blue and blew up on the internet practically overnight. Yeah, you know who I'm talking about. I'm talking about singer-songwriter Brook Hyde. Brook, welcome to my studio. Thanks. (Inaudible) Let's just give the folks a little background about you. You're... You're fairly new to our city, correct? Uhh, yeah. I've been here about two years. I guess that's fairly new. Yeah, that's new. Where are you from? I'm from rural Ohio. You know Pretenders? You a big Pretenders guy? Nah, nah, I don't. (Mumbling) Ohio No? So, where you from in Ohio? Uhh, west central Ohio, little town called Houston. "Houston"? Yep. Houston, like, Houston... Is that Houston Street or Houston Avenue in New York, Ronnie? Uhh, I just know Houston in Texas. Okay. What was Houston, Ohio like? Had a lot of craft fairs, a lot of chilli cook-offs. Oh yeah, a lot of those? Yeah, you could probably go to one every day if you wanted. Yeah, I might do that. I'm the kind of guy who, like, if I eat something... Like, let's say I'm eating chicken... I eat chicken every day for, like, a month. And then I don't eat anymore. Like, I'm a streak eater. You ever... What about you? Umm, I've never heard of that. You never heard of that? No. (Inaudible) So, you... You come from a big family, I hear. Yeah. I've got three sisters: Joy, Spring and Merrily. Ha, those are... Those are pretty cool names. Yeah. Who came up with those, your mom or your dad? It was definitely my mom. Is your mom who you got the creative genes from? Uhh, she's pretty creative. Yeah? Yeah. You got the creative side from your mom. What you get from your dad? What do you mean? I mean, like, what your dad pass on to you? He taught me how to say "Fuck". Wow. Uhh, Brook, you can't cuss. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. Believe me, I had to learn too. So, umm, there's a lot of buzz about you, uhh, in the indie scene. And there's so many musicians I know that would just kill to trade places with you. You mean they want to make no money and be mildly successful to a small group of people? I like your humility. But I mean, come on, give yourself a break. I think you've done pretty well for yourself. You've really generated a cult following over the last 12 months. And I'm sure that cult following is going to be very happy to hear that you are headlining a show this Friday at San Diego's Casbah. Is that correct? Yeah, that's what I hear. Except to hear some new material there? Honestly, probably not. But you been writing some new stuff since the last album? No, not really. It's just... It just has been feeling kind of pointless to me lately. You mean the industry? I mean everything, making music, making art, It all just seems really stupid to me right now for some reason. How so? I don't know. I just... I have this neighbour who's got this garden. And she's, umm... She's got all these sections. She's got the carrots over here. She's got cabbages over there. She's got fruit trees in the back. And when she's all finished up, she's got something she can actually put in her mouth, you know, to keep her alive. It's something real. It's something raw, important. And, umm... And just the other day, I was... I was watching her. And I was thinking, "You know what? That's a real artist. "Why doesn't somebody like that have, you know, fans and shows and radio interviews, things, you know?" That's a really good question, dude. I mean, every time I see her, I just... It makes me think that what I'm doing is a complete waste of energy. So, why do you do it? I don't know. I don't know. That's what I'm trying to figure out right now. I'm sorry, guys. I mean, this guy... This guy with the way he connects and the words he uses, I see why his music touches us. I mean, wow. Now... You left the farm. Why'd you leave the farm? 'Cause you wanted to be closer to the ocean? No. I... I hate the beach. (Chuckling) Seriously though, man, why'd you pick San Diego? There's a lot of cities with, uhh, indie music scenes, you know? I hear Austin's nipping at our heels. Your mom was from San Diego, right? Is it because your mom's from here? She was from here. What part of the city's your mom from? I'd rather not talk about her, if that's okay. I was just trying to, like, help the audience, you know, get to know you better. We haven't been doing that? We have. I'm sorry. I was just... You ran out of questions. You start asking me questions about my mom. I don't feel like talking about her. You're not okay with that? No, I'm fine with that. Would you want me to talk about how she died two years ago? And I moved out here? And how when I wrote my album, with the music, it was, you know, I was trying to figure all that out for myself, how to grieve? Maybe you could fulfill your childhood dream. I might, you know, start balling like... You can have, like, a Barbara Walters special or something like that. Is that what you're trying to do? Man, what... Where is this coming from? Look, man, if your mom died, would you want to talk about it on some indie pop radio show? Hmm? Do you realize that I'm just trying to help you promote yourself? I have no idea, actually, what the fuck you're trying to do. I'm just trying to promote your music. Well, guys, uhh, that's the end of the interview. Umm, thank you so much for, uhh, for coming in to Brook Hyde. I'm going to leave you with "Spectator", a track from his debut album, Canines. Get the fuck out of my studio. Two blocks down on the corner Have a good one. Watch the scene unfold You know, guys, he was a little rough on me. But sometimes, an artist has to express himself in ways that we don't understand. But you know, we're gifted with his music. And just because he's an A-hole, doesn't mean... I'm... Let's go... I'm not even on, am I, Ronnie? They're playing the song. God. That guy... That guy F'd me up, man. I thought you did really good at the end though. You wrapped it up really nice. I seriously was just trying to help him promote his career. It was... It was intense. You ever... Ron, you ever go just, like, "What else could I do with my life?" You know? Did you know he was going to ask that shit? Dude, I had no idea. Well, next time you convince me to do something like this, you know, maybe you should fucking find out first. I know, man. I'm so sorry. I don't want to talk about it. Fuck. (Lock clicking) Fuck that guy. He shouldn't have done that. Wait till I get my hands on him. You want to grab a couple tall cans, play a quick nine? - I'm Clarke. - Hi. This is my friend Brook. Brook, come over here. He's going to be a famous musician one day. How are you, hon? Congratulations. He likes to embellish a little bit. All right, have a good one. Thank you for the ball. Yeah. Why do you have to say stuff like that? I just like being nice to people. You're such an ass. Fore! Shit. I'm taking my mulligan. Already? Oh, we feeling brave today, huh? You know Kells is dating Spaceface? Yeah, Dennis? I think they've been going out for a couple weeks now. You knew about it? Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I thought everyone already knew. That's wonderful. I'm the last idiot to find out. I thought you said you were over her? I am. Okay, you should be. Brook, look at you. You're, like, genetically advanced by, like, light years. If I was a girl... Fuck! This shit is not helping. That one got right here. Party tonight at Joel's place We're gonna light up the place with our smiles Oh, my friend Taylor's going to be at the party, the girl I told you about from Seattle. She said you're cute. She likes your music. Woo! So, this beer's made from carob pills and Special B, paired along with a trappist yeast, which was used by monks in Belgium. You get a nice, Belgian pale ale. The idea is to take a photo that looks completely accidental. So, you have just, like, like a palm tree or a ceiling fan, where it's just like tons of negative space. Yeah, yeah, oh! You can kind of, like, frame their faces in there, but just, like, kick it up a little bit and get, like, a weird corner. And you want a ton of tension. That's the negative space. Downtown Victoria, they have... This shit is exhausting. Want to go? Nah, I just need a little break. Okay. Oh, wonderful. Hey, boys. Hey, Kells. This is my friend Dennis. This is Clarke and Brook. Dude, I love Spaceface. Oh, God, thank you. Umm, hey, Brook, great to finally meet you. I just took a piss. Oh, well. Umm, I got to say, I love your last album, totally reminds me of some of that early Tom Blake stuff. I hate that guy. Oh, really? Well, I'd love to, umm... I don't know if you'd be down with it... but remix one of your songs, add some kind of dance track to it, some beats, some, like... Ooh Like... (Beat boxing) Just for fun, just to, you know, fuck around. Yeah, definitely. I think my shit would sound really cool with a techno beat, some Auto-Tune. Okay, umm, yeah, you know, just thought it'd sound like a good time. I like techno beats. This guy likes techno beats. - I'm going to... - See you in there. Yeah, cool, good meeting you guys. Yeah, thanks. Okay, I'm going to go inside too. Why are you being a dick? Why the fuck are you bringing him to my friend's house? Grow up, Brook. It's been a year. I'm not going to stop hanging out with all my friends because you feel uncomfortable. What do you think about all this trivial shit? (Laughing) Hey, guys, where's Sabrina? Oh, thanks, John, love to. So, this is just a standard that... 6/8 in "A", just repeats the one, three, two and five. And the chorus is "D", "A", "E", but in, umm, you know, half bars. It goes to the "C" minor, short minor, before it goes to the "E" the second time around, builds through the chorus. Do whatever the hell you want, I don't care, whatever feels right. One, two, three. One, two, three. This is a waltz if anybody feels like dancing. (Sighing) That you like it When the plotline and meaning are easy To understand Seems so perfect No questions, no loose ends, no restless nerves So, explain and explain it How it's all for the best No regrets And we concur Some intend to forget That you dug out all I had And you left me in the dirt And you always Started this shit about Our hungry hearts But I've only been thirsty A bottomless pit Since we've been apart All right. (Clapping) There he is. What's up? This is my friend Taylor from Seattle, the one I was telling you about. She's a big fan. Hey. (WHISPERING): She's Japanese. Okay. The last album made me breakup with my boyfriend. Oh. Sorry about that. It's okay. He was a douchebag. Uhh, okay. Is that your real hair colour? Uhh, yeah. Thought so. How far do you live from here? Did you have any relatives that got hit by that tsunami? I'm Chinese. Oh. Would you sing to me? No. Come on. If you sing to me, I'll show you my secret talent. What's that? (Whispering) Black is the colour Of my true love's hair (Muffled singing) No, one of your songs. No, no, no. That wasn't part of the deal. But that's what I meant. You really upset right now? You are so fucking cute. Mmm. Mmm, mmm. Oh my God. God, you have a huge tongue. Thank you. No, I mean, it fills my whole mouth up. I can't breathe. And you don't like that? I don't know. Can we just, uhh... Can we just take a break for a minute? Okay. (Sighing) Have you heard the new Spaceface album? You guys are friends, right? You're fucking with me, right? What? (Sighing) What's this move? (Groaning) (Laughing) What are you... (Laughing) Are you hungry? (Crickets chirping) (Knocking) WOMAN: Does that thing ring? WOMAN 2: I don't know if I should. WOMAN: It's not a doorbell. (Knocking) Maybe he went to the store. (Knocking) Check to see if it's open. It's unlocked. Brook? Brook? (Whistling) Shh. Go, go, go, go, go. Okay, wait, wait. Ready? Two, three. (Screaming) Oh my... Ha ha! (Blowing raspberry) Good morning. Why the hell are you guys in my room right now? You forgot? We left you, like, 20 messages. Really? I think more than that. Ow. It's good to see you too, Bro. I'm just a little... Hungover? It's good to see you guys. (Grunting) Me too. I want to smell him. Oh, wait a minute. You have to go take a shower. I can smell your feet from up here. What? Eww! Seriously! It's gross. You're right. Go, go, go. Still drunk. He doesn't look good. That's a pretty good choice for a country girl. (SOUTHERN DRAWL): Well, thank you kindly. Spring, the onions are going to burn. Wow, you guys clean fast. Nice pants. How'd you get into them? They look like they'd fit Mez. I think they're cute. You guys are dumb. Okay, who wants eggs? I do. Don't put so many mushrooms in mine. This isn't yours. This is for Brook. He's oldest. Oh, that smells so good. But I don't eat meat. Oh, they're not meat. They're chicken period. Eww. Joy, that's gross. What? It's true. I'm just going to have some orange juice. But you love my omelettes. Yeah, I do. But I'm vegan. Oh, okay, no, you're not. Well, believe what you want. Hey. What are you doing? Organizing all of our photos of Mom. Oh my gosh, look how cute you are. (Chuckling) So cute. Why are you doing this now? 'Cause Joy said I had to. Hey, Mez, how do you want your period? Uhh, runny, please. That's disgusting. You're disgusting. Hey, Mez. Why are you guys here? We're here to spread Mom's ashes. Do you not check any of the emails that I send you? Dad's all right with that? Yeah, it was his idea. Really? - You know, you still do that? - What? You always look to Mez to see if I'm telling the truth. No, I don't. Okay. I'm going to take this plate out to Dad then. What? What's she talking about? Oh, Dad's here. What do you mean, "Dad's here"? Check your messages. He's outside in the car. He said he's not coming up until you invite him. Is she serious? He's just being stubborn. Let's go out and talk to him. I'll go with you. Yeah, me too. Brook? (Door slamming) I read the advice in your letter To see myself without a filter So, tonight, I have locked all my doors I'm down on all fours Wild again The dawn light is slowly approaching Eyes open to slow down the spinning I bet you'd be proud of me now Lost in my own house Can't find a way out Oh Ah Ah! (Panting) Shame only came on display To the others, but I was wrong (Water running) Hey. Is Dad coming in? (Toilet flushing) He says he's going to sleep in the car. We might go to that motel. Does Brook have any floss? Good luck. Oh, look. Oh, he does love us. (Knocking) Brook, can we sleep in your bed? Sure. Great. I get the end. No, Joy, I always have to sleep in the middle. Oh, well, it's too bad. That's not even true. I like the middle. What? My God! (Laughing) Get off me. Shh. I'm trying to sleep. This sort of feels kind of nice. Shh. Are you ready for bed? (Groaning) Yeah. I got to brush my teeth. Okay. Go brush your teeth. (Water running) So, he's just going to sleep out there? You going to invite him in? I'm not going to play his fucking game. He's probably going to sleep out there. Brook? (Spitting) (Water running) (Dog barking) (Birds chirping) What are you doing? Got to go to work. You're subbing? Is it that same school? Yeah. Car's gone. He probably went to the motel. I'll call him. All right, I get off at 1:30. Okay, bye. "Gregory and Jeremy walked and walked and walked "down the street until it began to get dark and all the people went into their homes to go to sleep." See the stars and the moon? GIRL: Yeah. BOY: Is that a crescent moon? It is a crescent moon, yes. Looks like a fingernail. It does. It does look like a fingernail. "When they came to the bottom of the mountain, they saw the trees and the pine cones." I see a fly! "The rocks and stumps of the woods, "the emptiness where birds had laid their blue eggs. "Gregory sat back down on his chair. "Jeremy looked at the people passing by. He wondered if he was watching them." I think the dark one's a dinosaur. "Of if they were watching him." "'I think that, today, I am watching them, ' he thought." I think that that's all Mrs. Julie Johnson wanted you guys to do for language arts. You guys feel like making some music? - Yeah! - Yeah! Ooh! Sarah, what's up? Can we do one of your songs? Hmm. BOY: No. Let me think about that one. Okay. So, if we're going to do this song, we're going to have to make some drums, aren't we? How about we do this? (Slapping) (Snapping) That's great. And then I'm going to get to one part of the song where I'm going look at you. I'm going to go like this with my head. And that's when you guys stop. Then you start going... La, la La, la La, la, la La, la, la, la La, la, la That sounds great. Oh, God. All right, you guys, just wait one second. I'm going to talk to these ladies. And you just be quiet, okay? You guys are going to get me fired. We checked in at the office. See? Yeah, visitor's passes. Me too. He's not here. He checked in at a motel. We'll be really quiet. All right. I'm teaching them one of my songs. Good. Which one? "Black Bay". Love that one. Think it's all right for them? Mmm. Guys, these are my sisters: Merrily, Joy and Spring. They're going to join our little band, if that's okay. Paige? Umm, do they sing? Spring can. You want to? Mm-hmm. Okay, so we need to teach them the drums, don't we? The drums we were working on? Hmm? Nice and slow. (Snapping) (Slapping) Slow. (Snapping) Mmm, mmm Mmm, mmm Black bay Where'd you go? I have lost all the light From your boats It only makes me feel more Alone Grey fog, don't you tire Of the dark isolation of night Know that the pressure Gives the light And know that the truth comes with The quiet Just so afraid of mine So, I blame the ones that I love When I am no one To act as a judge And I know The bottle's not bent But I'm just so stumped For some kind of rest Please Look And my tide's up Ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh Yeast. Not too much. Mom liked a lot. Garlic salt. Okay, that's good. Okay, you get to try it first. Mmm. More. Not till we start the movie. What movie? I'll get it. You're going to love this. Okay. (Doorbell ringing) Come in. It's open. Oh, girls, lots of 'em. Cool hair. Thank you. Clarke, these are my sisters. I'm Merrily. I'm... I'm Clarke. I'm Clarke. Hey, I'm Spring. Clarke. Joy. How do you guys know each other? I'm sort of his manager. Not really. Well, sort of. - Clarke is an artist. - Oh, really? I try to be, nothing like your brother. You know, I try. Whatever, man. Clarke's got this huge art show tonight. It's not that big. - We can all go. - Yeah! What kind of art is it? Umm... Clarke did those. I... I did do these. Umm, this is my mother, which are disposable razors. And that would be, like, my dad with hair curlers. And I always liked to touch his moustache when I was little. If they two got together and pooped something out, then I like to think of myself as... Umm... Awkward. We're about to watch a movie. Do you want to come sit so you can see it? Okay. Oh. Sorry. I really like them. Oh, thank you. You want popcorn? Yep. Ready, you guys? The best home video ever. WOMAN: Mez, say hi. Hi. Want to play the guitar, Mez? And this is Spring Well, I'm Spring. Brook? Brook? Hello there. Mom, can you read us a story? I sure can. Bring me a book. Okay. Umm, wait. Hello? Did she tell you guys about her imaginary chipmunks? MAN: How about, uhh... Who want to go help me feed the chickens? I do! Me! - Move over. - Yes. We're going to get eggs, Mom? Mm-hmm, we are. Look at that. Can I grab that one? Can you reach it? There you go. All of them. B-B-Be real careful. Don't squeeze 'em. Don't squeeze 'em. Can you carry 'em back? All right. Mom? Can you help me find a brush? I know, I'll help you find a brush in one second. Let's go see your brother and dad on the piano for one second. Can you do that? ("Ode to Joy" by Beethoven) (Door opening) (Door closing) Woo! It's only temporary. I want to get a Soma, which is the best tubing for a chromoly frame. And when I get my next unemployment cheque, I want to get some Phil Wood hubs, gold tires, gold chain. It's going to be so rad. And I'm going to take off the brakes 'cause the brakes are only for beginners. So, I will... I think. Have you guys ever seen Avatar? Can I have one? Didn't know you smoked. I don't light it. I just like the taste. You're weird. What's Dad doing? He's fine. He said he's probably going to meet up with us tomorrow. Sounds awesome. (Birds chirping) Why'd you leave? Honestly, because I'm not a very good person. Come on. I'm not trying to guilt trip you. Well, I don't know how else to answer that. I was driving in my car on the way to the funeral. And instead of turning right, I just kept going straight, till I got here. What exactly is it that you're doing here? Just waiting for happiness to become cool again. That's depressing. I don't know how to do it anymore. What? That. Safety first! Go! Go! I know it doesn't seem like it but I really am trying. Not excited that I turned out this way. Honestly, it surprises me. Always thought I was a pretty emotionally stable person. (Chuckling) You're serious. CLARKE: Brook? Do you guys want to go watch me race? It's my first time on a velodrome. Oh... Okay. When? Right now. Hey, everybody. Thanks for coming down to the San Diego Velodrome again. Good to see you. Brook, what's up? Hey, man, you're here to see Clarke, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I got you guys some seats, actually. There's a bunch of, like, fixer wannabes in the front row. So, anyway, so are you excited for Friday? Uhh... You're going to play, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, are you just working on new stuff or... new music? No, not really, nothing new. Oh, just focussing, that's cool. I like to focus sometimes. I usually, like, listen to Canines, actually, before a ride. Hey, guys. Brook's here. Remember I told you to move when Brook... How you doing? Good to see you. Is Brook famous? Maybe to these people. Nice to see you. All right, riders, going to have to roll up on the wall. I'd encourage you to get in position, get ready to race. So, you going to introduce us to your friends? I don't really know any of their names. Hey, guys, there's Clarke. BROOK: Clarke! ANNOUNCER: Going to start you quarter to 1:00 there. Riders, roll off. Oh! Come on, Clarke. You got this. (Cheering) Go, Clarke. Hey, look over here. You're worse than Mom. Thank you. ANNOUNCER: We're all real proud of Clarke. He's really far back there. He's... He's out there. JOY: Keep going! ANNOUNCER: No one's really keeping score anyway. Hey, Brook. Are you going to Clarke's art show tonight? Yeah. Rad, us too. Cool. Cool. See you there. Rad. You know what your problem is? Depends on which one you're talking about. You surround yourself with too many people who worship you. It's not healthy. You're probably right. But it's hard to avoid when you're as cool as I am. (Laughing) (Cheering) I can feel it in my head, all the way down to my toes Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, all to my toes It's actually a Marcel Duchamp bicycle piece. I got the idea from him. And when you spin the wheel, no matter how much the wheel wants to go somewhere, it can't go! It makes me feel, like, flabbergasted. And this one was inspired by Joseph Kosuth, my favourite. He actually, uhh, made an art piece in 1965 called One and Three Chairs. And it was basically the reference, the object and the definition. One of the guys wrote "The finest, smoothest drinking beer out of a can, evidence that there truly is a higher power." Do you guys want to hear something cool? Yeah. Okay, look at that. Don't look at me at all. (Clarke imitating dolphin) This one is pretty self-explanatory. It's called Don't Talk With Your Eyes Full. Here. Want to listen to it? Yeah. CLARKE ON TAPE: I can see you. You can see me. I am eye. Eye. I am eye. I am the President of the United States. Took me seven months to make. But it's done. - What are you talking about? - Be born again. We have to figure it out. What are you talking about? 3.14 is pi. Ohm. (Groaning) (Babbling) Hello. Hello, everyone. Umm... Hi, everyone. Umm, whoa, all eyes on me. WOMAN: Hi. Hi. Wow, my heart's beating pretty fast right now, so many people looking at me. Umm, hi, my name's Clarke, as many of you know. Umm, I just wanted to say really quick thank you so much for coming out to my art show and seeing some of, uhh, my really silly art. Umm, it means a lot to me that you guys came out to support. I just really... Uhh, my heart. I just really, umm, appreciate it that... that more than five people showed up, umm, to my art show. And, umm, it just means a lot to me and... MAN: Yeah, Clarke! Yeah, yeah. (Cheering) And I love you guys so much. And while I have your attention, everyone, umm, I just wanted to remind everyone that Friday night there's going to be a show that you guys don't want to miss. He's one of the most talented singer-songwriters I have ever seen. And he just happens to be my best friend in the whole, wide world, uhh, Brook Hyde. (Cheering) It will be... It will be Friday night, tomorrow night at 9:00, at the Casbah. Write it in your calendar. Don't forget 9:00 at the Casbah. Umm, and I'm just very excited. Thank you so much for coming out. And, umm, let's party. Thank you, guys. (Cheering) Uhh, that was nerve-racking. Beer? Can you not ever do that again? What? This is your night. Don't throw the spotlight on me. Come on, man, you're amazing. You're... I can't... I can't help it. It just pours out of me. Look, I'm fucking serious, Clarke. This shit pisses me off. Okay. Cheers? Yeah. Okay, so I want you to be honest. What do you think? Of what? My art. Ah, come on, man. You know I'm not good at that shit. It's okay. I just want you to be honest. I thought it was pretty cool. Yeah? Oh, man, thank you. Thank you. Which one did you like the most? The pink dolphins one is pretty cool. Don't make me choose. Did you listen... Hey, Clarke. - Hey, guys. - What's up, guys? Hey, thank... Thank you for coming. Yeah, dude, any time. What the fuck are they doing here? Dennis is going to play a quick set. Then he's going to leave. Of course he is. Only 'cause you couldn't do it. So, that left you no choice but to book Spaceface. I just like his music. I do see similarities in your work. What do you mean by that? You just... You just told me you liked my art. Yeah, well that was back when I thought you were worth lying to. I don't need your lies to make me happy. I'm cool. You can tell me what you really think. (Sighing) If I film this straw for 30 minutes, upped the contrast, added a hipstamatic filter, projected it on a wall in an endless loop, people will... because they're stupid... will think that there's some kind of meaning behind it. But there isn't. It's a fucking straw. So? So, that's the kind of empty, thoughtless shit that's infesting the world and making it impossible to find anything that isn't a complete waste of time. There's too many assholes out there with cameras and computers making pointless crap and calling it art. It's fucking everything up. Dude, why can't we just have fun making stuff? Great, man, have fun. Have fun. I don't want to take your fun away from you. Don't call it art. Call it something else. Call if fluffy shit. Yeah, you and Spaceface and all those 15-year-old art fuckers on YouTube are making some great fluffy shit. Dude, wow. Umm, you're being an a-hole right now. I'm not claiming to be a great artist. I'm not claiming to make good art. I just do it because it makes me happy. Trust me, man. It's not your art that makes you happy. It's your incognizance. Well, I guess I should be offended. But I don't know what that means. - You don't? - No. Well, that sounds about right. Must be pretty hard to be you, Brook. Enjoy the set, man. I will. Woo! Spaceface! There is a strobe And the lights are scoping some motion I can recall I'm obsessed with each little moment I am the cone exploding In pieces out there to glow I just don't know but I think I'm losing control (Music shutting off) Playing tracks from a fucking computer. Go home and listen to that shit. Spaceface! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Are you okay? You all right? Get him out of here. Come on. Come on, Brook. No, no, no, no. Hold on. Hey, hey, hey. Are you all right? Hey, Clarke, man, I'm sorry, man. Dude, it was an accident. Yours was. Not his. Fuck, man. Hey, man, you should hit me. You should hit me. Come on, man. You'll feel better. Just hit me right here. Come on. I deserve it. Come on. Whoa! Get the fuck out of my face. Hey, man, I'm just... - Come on! - "Trying"? I'm trying... Now! Hey, what... I don't understand why everybody's so sad. Why the long faces? What don't you just tell Spaceface to hit the space bar and let the magic begin, huh? (Crickets chirping) Until I wake up, cold and sick Praying that I can undo what I did Even if I don't know what that was I really fucked up, didn't I? But please don't judge me for In due time I won't bury my heart in hindsight And maybe you could love Only girl Mmm Ooh Ooh (Speaking Japanese on video) MAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? (Speaking Japanese on video) Are you all right? Ever hear of Miki Endo? Miki who? She lived in one of the cities that got hit the worst. Over half the people died there. She was the one broadcasting the warnings on the local station, telling everyone to get to higher ground. She kept saying, over and over, "Get to higher ground. The tsunami is coming," over and over and over. She never let go of the microphone, until the waves just destroyed the whole city. One of the old men that made it to safety been listening to her broadcasts said they saw her get swept away. (Speaking Japanese) She was younger than me. (Speaking Japanese) Fuck, it hurts so bad. What? Your stomach? Are you sick? No. Maybe. I don't know. Just... What's... What's wrong? Uhh... I think, uhh... (Sighing) I think I just remembered how fucking lonely I am. (Grunting) (Panting) (Coughing) (Crying) I miss... I miss Mom. (Crying) I know you do. (Crying) It's going to be okay, all right? Come on, Brook. Come on. (Birds chirping) (Machine whirring) We should probably get going soon. Okay. (Whirring) You okay? I'll be fine. Hey, Dad. Hey, sweetie. Days gone by What's up with the boat? Without things I like Did you want me to swim out there? Praise bad dreaming of Sanctuary beaches Right in front of me Ooh, ooh (Gull squawking) Hi, Mama. We're here. We finally made it. We really miss you. But don't worry about us. We're... We're okay. We're all okay. We love you. Okay, say hi to the dolphins for me. (Gull squawking) (Whistling) I'm going with you. Okay, we got go get passed before we get in. Fuck! Shit! What's wrong? I lost her. (Gull squawking) What are they going to do if they find her? Fish her out and throw her back in? She's probably laughing her ass off right now. (Chuckling) Your mom... She never liked to do things like regular people. Four years before you were born, she knew what your name was, all of you, said she wanted 'em to be unique, so we'd know which ones were ours. When she had you, they tried to give her that needle thing in her spine for the pain. She wouldn't do it. She heard from some hippie that it was bad for the baby so... Pushing you out feet first, no painkiller... She squeezed my hand so hard, she broke my finger. Really? Wore a splint on it for two weeks. I told her I... I busted it working on that old Ford truck. I just didn't want her to know she was stronger than me. But she was. (Gulls squawking) I'm sorry I didn't show up at the funeral. It's okay. (Gulls squawking) Woo! I found her! Dad, I can't believe you did that on the boat. I totally thought you were going to die. Yeah, Dad, that was scary. Come on. I was holding onto the boat the whole time. I wasn't a big deal. Oh, yeah right. Was it, Mez? It was kind of bad. I can't believe you all do that. Nobody believes anything I say. Everybody has to look at Mez. Why do you look at Mez? It's because you're basically a pathological liar. That's so mean and not true. Yeah, it is. Ask Mez. Okay, no. And you're violent. And you're violent. Okay. Mez, what are you doing? My shoes are still wet. Here, let me take that. Nah, nah, I got this. Okay, all right, well you know what? You guys are going to kill yourselves. And I'm not going to watch. Here. Thanks, Dad. That it? That's it. Backseat, please. Yes, ma'am. Don't bump your head. Thank you. It was good to see you guys. Come here. You guys, come here. I can't reach you. Come visit sometime. I'll think about it. (Birds chirping) See you, Pops. Try to eat a little bit more, huh? You look a little thin. Okay. You take care. SPRING: Ten seconds. Hurry! Oh, God. (Chuckling) Ow. Awesome. Shotgun. (Engine starting) (Birds chirping) (Water running) What's up? I'm sorry, man. You forgive me? 'Cause if you don't, then... (Retching) (Knocking) CLARKE: You okay? (Door opening) Brook, you okay? Hey. I know you think you're going to mess this up. But you're not. (Whispering) Sorry about that. It's been a pretty crazy week. Uhh, I don't know. Umm, don't know why I'm up here singing all these whiny songs when people in other places are drowning in their living rooms. But, uhh, also, I just wanted to tell you thank you for coming out, really appreciate you coming to listen to my music. And, uhh, I'm going to do a really old one, if that's okay. This is a... the song I was supposed to sing at a funeral. She wasn't a sad person. So, it's not a sad song. Cold December morning Woke me from my window So I stood to see The winter glow I could see you standing outside With Rufus at your heel Staring at the dull light Falling pink upon The snowy field I remember when you said Comfort's the first thing we forget Once the light of day Has passed You said we've come to love the oak groves Because they all see what we know And when we watch their growth We watch our own When I close my eyelids Deep into the night Still can see the shape Of light that shone around you all my life Oh, oh, oh, oh, the autumn rain So, oh, oh, oh, oh, cast in for days And you walked aside Into the armour's grave To baptise The underneath So we'd know that We make little ourselves And tired You're freezing In a photo We remember it well Though the pressure makes our bodies ache And the darkness swallows up the day Our tiny mouths have only things to say Ooh Oh, oh Ooh Oh, oh Ooh Oh, oh Ooh Oh, oh Ooh Oh, oh Ooh Oh, oh Ooh Oh, oh Ooh Ooh Ooh What makes a man cave? To the simple escape From his days? Is it only a triumph For the fear? Of what happens when Waking disappears? Or do we secretly love these tears?
