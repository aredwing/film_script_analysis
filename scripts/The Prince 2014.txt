How... how is everything? Good. Good. Things are good. Just, you know, I'm tired and... I bet. A lot of work. A lot of books. Yeah. Oh! Taste of Chicago, hot delivery. Uh, want a bite? You want a bite. - Oh, my God. - One little bite. I miss that place so much. Stop, stop. I'm picking you up from the airport. We're going right there when you come in the weekend. Awesome. Finals? Good, bad, what? They were fine. Nothing too intense. But, um... It was... it was good. What's the matter? No, what? What do you mean? Oh, nothing, I... I, um, just a little, uh... you seem a little down. I don't know, maybe I'm getting the flu or something. - I don't know. - What the fuck are you doing? I... I gotta go. I... I have an exam tomorrow, and, um, I should go. Okay. Yeah, I don't want to keep you from studying. Dad... I... I can't wait for next weekend. Me, too. Miss you. I miss you. Take care. Bye. What? Yeah? Hey, uh, who's... Wh-who's this? Who's this? You're the one calling me. I'm, uh, Beth's father. I'm looking for Beth. Is she there? Shit, this ain't even my phone. Hi, you've reached Beth. You know what to do. Hey, Beth, it's dad. Um... I just called your phone, and, uh, I don't know, some guy answered it. He didn't seem to know who you were, so I wond... I... did you lose your phone or something? But, uh, if you did, you're probably not getting this. Anyway, uh, give me a call. Also, yeah, I got a, uh... a notice from school about something, but I'll... you know, we'll talk about it, um... Just call me. All right, bye-bye. Hey, it's Dad. Just calling again. Don't want to bother you, just, um... I don't know, just give me a call. Thanks. Westwood Palms. Yes, this is Paul Brennan. Uh, my daughter is Beth Brennan. I called earlier and I talked to a, uh... a Justin. Uh, he was gonna go check on her. Um, I've been trying to call. There's no answer. Doesn't look like anybody's been there for a while. Okay. Thank you. - There you go. - Okay. Let me, uh... let me ask you something. You see either of these... Two girls here tonight? Couldn't tell you, man. After a while, they all look the same. Okay. Excuse me, uh, I'm wondering if you could help me for a second. Whatcha drinkin'? No, no, I just, uh... I-I-I'm looking for my daughter... In the stripes. Well, like the sign says, you want a beer or a shot of whisky? No, no, I just... Have you seen either of these girls here tonight? All right, here it is. It's gonna be $4.00. How 'bout this? You just take this 20, look at the picture, and give me an answer. Sorry, buddy, haven't seen either of them tonight. Good luck with that. Can I have a water, please? Water. Thank you. Here you go. Thank you. And I won't have to lose it. Don't be aggressive. - Go to the next bar. - Yeah. Let's go. That'd be nice. Excuse me. Not interested. Just give me a second. Miss, I'm... I'm Beth's father. - Really? - Nick, uh, it's okay. Where'd you get this? From her apartment, which I've been calling for a week, and there's no answer, so I'm just wondering... Oh, so you've been going though her stuff. Well, I'm worried about her. I don't know where she is. - Can we get out of here? - Yeah. - Yeah, this place sucks. - Yeah. Let me ask you one thing... - Hey, wait! - Hey! Let go of her, asshole! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! That's enough! That's enough. Everybody... Hey, hey! Come on! Can you help me? Just five minutes. That's all. Uh, hey, you guys go ahead. I'm gonna meet up with you later. This is such bullshit. - I said I'll meet up with you later. - Whatever. Uhh. Are you all right? I'm fine. Just a few questions. I already told you, I don't know where she is. You're her friend, right? So you know her. You have some ideas. Anything, where she... I... I... Five minutes. Give me five minutes. I'm hungry. So you haven't heard from her. People change. We're in college. We have lots of distractions. It's real... I understand that, I understand that. It's just I don't know where she is. That's never been the case before. You're her friend, you're telling me you don't know where she is. So... any help you can give me. I'm not a bad person. Okay, I do what any other person my age does. I like to go out. I like to party. I like to have a good time. I work hard. Beth? She doesn't go to school anymore. She... is doing shit that I'm not into. - What does that mean? - I don't know. You do know, you said... what does that mean? So, a month ago, we went to New Orleans, and ended up meeting this guy named Eddie. Thinks he's this bad-ass because he's got drugs everywhere, and everyone here probably knows him, 'cause they go to him to get some shit. But... she fell for it and fell for him. She said she was gonna go down last week and that she'd be back Sunday, and I haven't heard from her. - Do you know this guy? - Everybody knows this guy. Yeah, but do you... do you know where he works? Do you know where he lives? Do you know where he deals? Any of those things? I told you, New Orleans. Are you not listening? New Orleans is a big city. Do you know where you can find him? I'm... yeah. I know people that know him. Can you drive me down there right now? I'll give you some money. Um, I don't know if you can tell I'm really drunk. - I'll drive your car. - I cannot drive. I'll give you $500. We drive down. Just point out where he lives. It doesn't matter, whenever we get there. You can go right back. - That's all I'm asking. - Wait, can you just go back a second? - You'll... - Did you say $500? Yeah. - Are you messing with me? - No. - I mean, it's the middle of the night. - Now. Thank you. Check! Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - If you're so worried about Beth, why wouldn't you just call the cops? Because they wouldn't even do anything for 48 hours... Unless I reported her missing. And even then, they're not gonna give it any priority. They'd just assume she's some teen who ran away. Which she kind of has, if you think about it. Not the Beth I know. How many Beths do you think there are? One. You know what I think? I think this whole thing's your fault. You're the stereotype. You're like one of those hard-ass parents that... Just doesn't get it. It's like the more you keep someone from doing something, they more they want to try it. So, uh, your suggestion is that I... I should encourage her more to get drunk and stoned and maybe participate in that. Is that what your dad did? No, that is not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that you should just let her be a teenager. You know, it's natural to experience things. And, from what I heard, you kept her on lockdown and you barely let her out of the house. What'd you expect? Is that what she said? Come on. Uhh! Come on, you can't keep a kid locked up, because then they finally get out there in the real world, and they start experiencing all the shit that they've been missing, and then they go crazy. You know, it's like they're trying to make up for lost time. You are so annoying. You think this Eddie character will be in there? It's where we met him. When we get in there, I want you to keep a little distance from me. In this city, it's gonna be better off for you if people don't realize we're together. What are you talking about? Just trust me on that. So I'm just gonna go find a quiet little corner to sit in. Spend a few minutes out here, and then follow me and... Just do whatever you normally do. You see this Eddie guy, just let me know somehow. Just... try and tell me about it, but don't be real obvious, okay? Okay. Ahh. Beth? You wanna dance? Is he here? Come on. I swear, no one will know we're together. Just some creepy old man and his young girl. Easy. Mmm. Is he here? No. What do you want? I'm just trying to have some fun. Oh, I feel so good right now. You should try it sometime. I know a place we could go. Like this? Mm... yeah. It's like the only place that's open. - Would you slow down, man? - How far away is this place? I don't know, it's like right down the strip. - Like 10 or 15 minutes. - Come on, please. Let's go. Come on. Wait, wait, wait. Did you see that guy in the camo vest? - Come on, bring the girls, dude. - That him? No, but I've seen them hang out a lot. - All right, cool. - Wait here. Hey, man, right up here. I'm there. Hey... I'm, uh, looking for Eddie. Do I know you? Just tell me where he is, I... I have something for him. If you did, you'd know where to find him. Get the fuck out of here. - Not until you tell me where he is. - You just fucked yourself, buddy. Get him! Back off! If I ever see you here again, you're a dead man. Crazy motherfucker. You're not going anywhere. Fine by me. We can do this all day long for all I care. Holy shit, what was that? Are you okay? Find his number. Find his number. Send him a text, ask him where he is. Well, what if I don't hear back from him for hours? That's why you need me. Wait, wait a minute. What the fuck was that? Seriously! What the fuck just happened? Ohh! Can you take me home? I wanna go home. We're going to a place right up here where you can crash for a bit. You gotta come down. Okay, on a scale of one to 10... 10 being, I don't know, the Sistine chapel, and one being a steaming pile of shit... how nice are we talking? Probably a three. Three? That's like... that's like two steps away from shit! Can you walk? Seriously, are we staying here? Oh my... you know, there's places that aren't too expensive that actually wash their sheets, right? Not today. We're here. I know people. I can get us a room somewhere. Oh, I'm sure you do. We have a room. Okay, now that we're all settled in, - do you want to tell me what's going on? - We're getting some sleep. That's not what I'm talking about. You don't go to the cops. You don't want to be seen together. You take me to this shit hole in the middle of nowhere. You beat those guys like it was nothing. I need some answers. You're in no condition to have any answers right now. - Let's just get some sleep. - It's fine. I'm just tired. Thank you, Beth's dad. Ohh, can you just drive me home, please? I can't believe I got myself into this shit. Oh, my God. I have the worst headache ever. This is ridiculous. I'm just so tired. Will you drive me home? This is not what I signed up for. I don't know why you won't let me just, like, text the guy. I go and I party there all the time. Like, we could stay in a really nice place... clean beds and hot showers and... I'm sorry. Who are you? Beth's dad. Did this hurt? Yes. Does it still hurt? A bit. How did she die? Leukemia. Beth never really talked about it. She mentioned you. She missed you. Well, I bet you helped her with that homesickness, huh? Mm-hmm. Introduced her to all the right people? Like the ones who'll give you a line of blow for a favor in the most convenient bathroom stall? I bring my own to the party. Oh. Is that him? Yeah. He's at some bar called Excite. He's sitting at a table on the second floor. You can't miss him... he's sandwiched between two girls. What's this? It's not enough? You want me to leave? We had an arrangement. But... What about Beth? I didn't come all this way to not know. I need you to leave. Ohh, fuck! Black jack, Mr. Riley? Yeah, that's good, Carl. Thanks. Anything else I can get you? No, that's good. Leave the bottle. Son of a bitch. Carl... Bring another glass. You got it, boss. Do you mind if I take a seat? Excuse me? Mind if I sit down? Who the fuck are you? I'm looking for my daughter. Her name is Beth. Beth Brennan. Sorry, man. Never heard of her. But, uh, there is a club across the street, and she's probably spinning around on a pole right now. So fuck off. Ladies, please excuse us for a moment. They're not going anywhere. Only one that's leaving is you. Seriously. Who does this fuckin' guy think he is? I have no interest whatsoever in what your business is. I don't even care how you know my daughter. In fact, the less we know about each other, the better off you're gonna be. But I wanna know, and I need to know, where she is now. And neither of us are leaving this table until you tell me. Is that a fact? Hey, why don't you girls, uh... take off, huh? - What the fuck, man? - Shut up, Eddie. Come on, let's go! I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive my young friend here. You know how kids are these days. Just spouting off, shooting off their mouth when they don't know shit. He's not a bad kid. He's a good kid, basically, and I'd like to see him live a little longer. You don't recognize me, do you? No, I can't say I do. I was at Stuart's the night you took down seven people. I'd never seen anything like it. There was guns firing all over the place. Every time we'd shoot, we'd miss, like you made out of... air or something. Like a ghost. And then the bodies started hitting the ground. Seven of them, falling all around me. I fell, too, but I wasn't hit. Not yet. You don't remember this? You started walking across the room to me, stepping over the bodies, coming right for me, like you could... Smell that there was still somebody alive in the room. You put your gun right up to my head. I waited for you to pull the trigger. Closed my eyes. That gunshot never came. By the time I had the guts to open my eyes, you were long gone. Well... I used to drink back then. Well, maybe you let me live so that, 20 years later, we'd be sitting in a bar, and I could tell my nephew to tell you whatever you wanna know. I don't know where she is, man, I swear. We went out a few times. She started getting into harder stuff... heroin... but I don't do that shit. It's not what I do. Where is she? Last I knew, she was with The Pharmacy. You left her at a pharmacy? The Pharmacy is a scumbag drug dealer named Tony Martinez. Yeah, he works out of a warehouse on the east side. Where? 23rd and Atlantic. I'd appreciate... That you don't talk about this conversation. You have my word. Oh... Stuart's... I ran out of ammo. Oh, that guy gives me the creeps, man. Beth's my friend, all right? I'm not just gonna get in the car and turn around. What part didn't you understand about? Aren't you glad I'm here? - I'm driving. - What would you have done? I'm driving. Move over. - Are you gonna take a taxi? - Let's go. Go, go. Come on. Let's go. Remind me again who this guy is. Former boxer, been talking behind your back. Making himself appear like... Somebody connected to you. I heard local vice has taken a vested interest in him. Okay. Donny Musical. How could you forget that name? Everybody says you're a real punk. Now you've been making problems for me... My family. My family and my friends, you make promises you can't keep. Borrow money you can't repay. Down here... You can't get away with that shit. Don't say anything just yet. You can do all this bullshit posturing in L.A. and New York, but you can't do it down here. Not in my city. You think that's gonna impress anybody? Donny... nothing is more important than your name. And you've been using mine. You cheated me... you went behind my back and took something that didn't belong to you, Donny. I'm not gonna forgive you. Only God forgives. Bye-bye, Donny. Uhh! It's definitely him. It's been 20 years since he's been seen in the city. How can you be so sure? O'Reilly took special interest as soon as he walked in the door. You bring him to me. Now, do you understand? We're tailing him now. Boss, I know you don't want to hear this, but you pay me a lot of money to give you honest counsel. Let this one go. Let what go? What are you talking about? Think I can let it go? You get some people... now. The best people you can get. If The Prince is here... Bring him to me. Get up as close to him as you can. So, Beth's dad... Where are we going? I'm taking you home. You're gonna go to the train station... - I don't... - ...'Cause that's best for everybody. I don't want to go. I am not going. Pull over! Down! You're okay. Stay down. Uhh! Stay in the car. Who you working for? Fuck you. Who you working for? Who fuckin' sent you? - Open up, open up! - No. No. There you go. Who... sent you? I'm gonna blow your fuckin' eyes out right now. Who sent you? Omar. Omar. Well, you tell fuckin' Omar that I'm passing through, and he better fuckin' let me pass through. You remember that? Wilson's dead. Joe's in the hospital, but it doesn't look like he's gonna make it. I told you to put your best people on it. We can do that, but we don't have much to go on. The guys at the bar aren't talking. He's here looking for a girl, an addict. That's all we know. I don't care what it takes. I feel like I would be remiss... If I did not reiterate my position. Your position? People that have limbs that are amputated still feel the pain in that limb, even though it's not there. That's the pain that I feel. Every time I look, I mean... I see his face. I feel that pain, and I see him looking back at me. We have a chance to get him. Right now. Let's go get him. Just take a breath. You're gonna be okay. How the fuck am I supposed to be okay? I just... Just watched you kill someone. One second, I'm at a college party. The next second, I'm in New Orleans, getting shot at. I need some answers! Why are they after you? Why? - What do you want? - Who are they? What do you have in here? What do you want? - What do you want? - I don't want anything! You want some pills? You want some pot? - Want some booze? - No, I want the truth! - Want some pot? What do you want? - Look at me! Look at me! You owe this to me! - Will you be quiet? - No, I want the truth. Why are there a bunch of men after a fucking mechanic from Mississippi? What do they want with you? Who are you? I'm not a mechanic from Mississippi. I was born two blocks from here. You can see the shitty little smokestack and the tenement. I wasn't a mechanic, I was just a piece of shit running the streets. And I got in a situation where I could go to jail or I can go to the military, so, obviously, I took the military. After months, lots and lots of enemies here. And I was good. Why are they after us now? Because I went and I came back, and you come back to what? I come back to this. And so I had one opportunity, I thought, that would get me out, and of course I took it. And, of course, I took the next one after that, and the next one and the next one, and I was what I always was, which is nothing and a liar. What do they want with you? I did something 20 years ago for these... For what? What? What? He was, uh, trying to take over the city, and it didn't matter who he eliminated. And there were lots. Lots. The violence got to a point where, uh, he needed to be stopped. At the end of the day, you know who's gonna be here? - He needed to be stopped. - You, Daddy. I love you. Are you okay? Mm, yeah, kind of. I miss you. Come here. Mm... daddy's girl. Mmm... Come here. Go run over to mommy, yeah? - Okay. - Oh, hey! Look what I have. What do you have? This is a present for you on the first day of school, puppy. - Thank you. - Don't open it till you get to class. Ohh. Come on, silly, we don't want to be late. - Oh, she won't be late. - Bye, Daddy. Bye, baby. Oh, I'm taking your car, okay? All right. All right. Rachel, wait, wait, wait, wait. I wanna get a picture of you guys. Cheese! I love you. I love you. Bye, honey. Have fun at school. Here you go. And I tried to stop it, but it was too late. It was too late to... it was too late for me. It was too late for her. And I'll never forget the look in her eyes. Not that I deserve pity for that. 'Cause I don't. It's just a fact. So it drove me out of here, and I left everything. And woke up somewhere. I don't know where. Fucking in a bottle. And that's where Anna Marie came in and lifted me up. Stupidly loved me... And 12-stepped me to the altar. And Beth was an accident. A happy accident. A blessed accident. But I can't have it. What am I gonna do with a child? I can nurture a child with my tools? They're gonna kill Beth if I don't get to her first. What? They're gonna try to kill me, and they'll kill you. So I need you to listen to me and I need you to trust me. You don't have to like me. You understand? Mm-hmm. And I will get you out of here. I really appreciate that. Thank you. Where are we going? I'm gonna drop you off with a friend, somewhere you're gonna be safe for a while. I'll get you when I get Beth back. Okay, you're leaving me where, exactly? I'll bring you back when I get Beth. It's someone I trust. Wait a minute. What are you doing? Oh, we're stealing a car? I'm here for Sam. They're on the way up. Jesus Christ. Wow. Good to see you. Come on in. How you been? I don't know. Hmm... hmm. Wow. This is impressive. Yeah. Really. What do you want, Paul? I gotta get my daughter. - Your what? - My daughter. She's gone, I've come here to get her. She's fallen into some bad stuff. Fallen into what? Some guy named "The Pharmacy." Oh, fuck. - You know him? - Yeah. He's a lunatic. Can you help me? Can't do that. I don't do that stuff anymore, Paul. Nothing personal. You don't have to leave this room. I will take care of him. What are you asking me to do? I just want some time, a safe place for Angela to stay here, give me some time to get Beth, and then I need a safe ride out of here. Clean. - Beth's your daughter? - Yes. - That's Angela? - That's right. Nobody gets hurt? Clean. Shit. Jesus. You know what'll happen if the word gets out that I'm with you again? Right? You know. I do, yeah. I do. So if I do this thing, I'm not gonna see you... Around town anymore, right? You're not gonna come back? You're not gonna see me anywhere, ever again, friend. How's your shoulder? I'm a righty now. Crazy motherfucker. Be careful out there. A lot of the old faces you knew... Can't trust them anymore. I never did, Sam. We'll wait here, then. Come in. - Hi. - Come on in. You want something to drink? You want something to eat? Uh, a drink's great, yeah. What do you want? You... we got everything. Do you have whisky? I'll get you whisky. That your boyfriend? No. He's my friend's dad. So are you gonna send anyone to help him? No. I'm not gonna send anybody. - Thank you. - He doesn't need any help. You really don't know who he is, huh? Not really. You know where South Garriston is? - No. - No? Garriston Street. Old timers called it Hadrian's Wall. Oh, I don't know what that is. When Rome was at the peak of its powers... You know, it ran most of the world, right? Ran everything, except in Scotland. There was this... tribe. They were so fuckin' crazy... That, even at the peak of its powers, it just wasn't worth it for the Romans to go in there. So this emperor, Hadrian, built a wall across Scotland. And he just walled 'em up. Gave 'em a... kingdom for themselves. South Garriston was Paul's territory. His own little kingdom, where he could do whatever the fuck he wanted. And nobody ever dared go in there. You wouldn't even know his name. Just called him "The Prince." "The Prince"? You better get away from him. How may I help you? Looking for Big Mike. Um, uh... My Daddy passed a couple years back. How can I be of service to you? My condolences. Sorry to hear about your old man. However, I left something here a while back and I need to pick it up now. Oh, yeah. Let's see. I don't give a shit how fast you think you are. At this range... I ain't gonna miss. You better be sure about that. Now, before my daddy passed... He told me three things: Never put 10 pounds of shit in a five-pound bag, never take credit when they got cash in hand, and if a man walks through that door with tattoos like you've got on your hand, "son, you better be ready to draw. 'Cause that man... that man brings hell with him wherever he goes." Big Mike helped me escape this city 20 years ago. Gave me a new name, a new identity. I left him something. We had an agreement. I'm here to pick that up. I am going to pick that up. He was my friend. Is that so? Jameson, one ice cube, one maraschino cherry. My daddy did have a sweet tooth. Uh, sorry about this, but you can never be too safe around here. What you're lookin' for, it's in the back. This is what you're looking for, huh? Looks like the flood got a hold of this. Oh, boy. I could, uh, I could clean 'em up for you. Put some oil on 'em. I don't think the coil broke on any of 'em. Probably take me a couple days. I don't have time. My daddy didn't have many friends. So... You can choose one of these. Consider it a gift from Big Mike. Only untraceable weapons this side of communist California. I'm gonna need Mercury-tipped bullets. I got black talons, plus Ps, hollow points. How many you gonna need? How many you got? What's up? What are you doing? Huh? I'm here to see Tony. Oh, you must have your addresses mixed up, because there ain't no Tony here. Look, don't waste my fuckin' time. Tony's your boss, The Pharmacy. I got some information for him. - You got an appointment? - No. But he does. What's that supposed to mean? Means if I'm not speaking to him in the next two minutes, he's gonna find himself dead... And we'll throw you in with the deal. You'll take that, shy hero? Okay, handsome. Get those arms up. Get 'em up, get 'em up. Hmm? What's this? What do you got here, hmm? What does it look like? Tough neighborhood. Bet your ass it is, old man. You can it back on the way out. Yeah, I will. Get your ass in there. Yeah. Yeah, I'm bringing him now. Come on! What's wrong with you, man? This the guy? That's him. Take a seat. No. I won't be staying long. Whatever makes you feel happy, pop. Jimmy tells me you got some information for me. Some sort of tip... That's gonna save my life. Matter of fact, I do. Lay it on me. It's about the girl that you've been living with. - I live with a lot of girls. - Well, that's good. Then you won't miss her when I take her out of here. Her name is Beth, Beth Brennan, my daughter. And she's leaving with me tonight. Why are we talking about bitches, anyway? I thought this was a life-and-death situation. It is... for you... If you don't let me take her out of here now. You got this all fucked up, pops. All wrong. You see... this ain't no prison cell. Especially your little girl. I mean, she wanted to be here so bad, she actually begged me to stay. Shit, you can look for yourself. She's still doing a little recuperating. You know, I ain't did nothing to her that she didn't ask me to do. You know how these kids are these days. They get a little taste of partying and drugs, and they just want more and more and more. Gotta have it. I'm just... a motherfucker willing to oblige. Well... You best be the motherfucker that obliges by keeping your ass on that fuckin' couch while I walk out of here with her right now, 'cause you won't be breathing, otherwise. Okay, that... that... that's not possible. You see, I got a call from my man. Omar. Yeah, that's right. He told me you'd show up. Said to keep you here on ice till he gets here. And the girl. Because he got something special planned for your baby girl. Close your eyes, baby. There we go. Hold on. Keep your eyes closed. Don't open your eyes. No, no, we didn't do anything! I swear, I swear! We told you to keep them on ice. Where are they? They're gone. Look at that. You got the 12-year. Yeah. A celebration here. You ready? Yeah, hold on. You don't want to waste the good stuff on a bad shot. How long till you can get us out of here? I'm working on it. How soon? I'll handle it. Don't worry. Okay. Is word out yet? Everybody knows you're back. I knew that'd happen. Glad it worked out. We've got him. A man with a bullet wound showed up this morning at the battle house. He had a girl with him who looked pretty strung out. Makes sense they would go to Sam's for sanctuary. Let everybody know. Do not cross my line. Hey. Hi. You look pretty. You look like shit. How are you feeling? She threw up again, so she should be feeling better. It's gonna get worse. Okay, well, I'm gonna go get a soda. - Do you want anything? - No. But I need you to get her ready to travel. We have to leave. Okay? Yeah, okay. Yeah. Hey, you. I'm all right. I'm all right. I know you are. Just gonna get you home, okay? I... I don't think I can go. Of course you can. Everything's changed. Not with me, it hasn't. You're the only reason I keep going, Beth. I don't know what home is anymore. We'll find it. Switch them around. Just you with me. I'll see you soon, okay? Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Say good night. I really wish you guys were coming with me. I can't protect you both. I understand. Well, will you call me when you get home safely? Yeah. Don't be too hard on her. I won't. Come on, guys. Wait on the corner for the tail. That's high cotton, blood. Jesus Christ. My heart's pounding. That Montecristo's not helping, is it? No. It's the adrenaline. Yeah. It's the only thing I miss. Nobody makes it through. Copy that. Remember that third street tavern? Remember that fuckin' clusterfuck? You got your shoulder all shot up. Jesus Christ, were we shit-faced. I don't know how we stumbled out of there and lived. Do you think it was money, Sam? Is that what it was all about? That's what we thought, right? Move in. Copy. Get her out of here, come on! He's got a gun! He's got a gun! Uhh! "Nobody gets hurt." You motherfucker. Get in. Just keep 'em off as long as you can. Keep 'em off. I got a daughter of my own. Whatever you need... It's yours. All right. Close the door on your way out. Please, I just... I just wanna go home. Where's home? Ponto... Pontotoc. - What? - Pontotoc. What's Pontotoc? Pontotoc, Mississippi. I used to work with your father. We knew each other. What? He took everything from me. Your father did. Everything. But you and I can ask him why... When he comes here... to see you. And you and I are just gonna sit here and wait for him till he gets here. Why? Baby... stop the scratching. I don't know what you're talking about. Please just let me go home. Listen to me... when we get there, it'll be 11 minutes before a response team shows up. So if we're not out that door by then, you have to go. You get in your car and you drive and you don't look back. - You don't come back. - Okay. Do you understand? Yeah. Is that okay? Yep. He's here. Hey. Hey. Let's go, come on. Come on, get up. We gotta go. Paul! Say, "Hi, Daddy. I'm a little scared." Daddy. Daddy. - Louder. - Daddy. "Daddy"! - Yeah. - Daddy! That's right! "Daddy"! Is this what you want? - No! - Is this enough?! Let her go and I'll let you walk away. You'll never see me again. That's enough anymore! You want me? You take me. I want you to know what it's like to lose the only thing that you ever loved in your life. You ready? You chose this life, we chose this life, and that's the cost. What about my wife and child?! What did they have to do with it? What?! Please don't! Collateral damage. It was a war. And you... Are gonna lose the only thing that you ever loved in your life. Say bye. Tell him you love him. - No, don't... - Tell him! - Please don't! - Say it! Say, "I love you, Daddy"! I'm gonna give you one more chance. No... please... Having a good time. Good time. Mm-hmm. Shh, shh, shh. Quiet now. See him? See him? Come on, come on, come on. All right, all right, all right. Good girl. Good girl. You're very brave. Very brave. See him? There he is. Daddy. Hi, Daddy. Say hi. One... Two... Shut up. Shut the fuck up. Shoot now. Shoot now. Let's go home.
