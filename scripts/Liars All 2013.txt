You're looking very sexy, Casey! Oh, yes! Come on, Casey! - Yes! Right here! - Give us a kiss! And here's a peek at the British sensation in her new video, Featuring none other than football striker Dennis Hoge. # I don't care if you never get it # # It's not fair and I never said it was # # It's just the way it is # # I won't fight it's too late to listen # # You're not right, and I'm not a victim # # No # It's just the way it is # # I've had enough # I'm gonna let you go # You can leave me now # You can walk away and break my heart # # I don't need you now # Turn around and tear my world apart # # You can beg, you can cry but I've made up my mind # # There'll be no next time this time # # So just let me know # 'cause I don't want you # Around to drag me down You know he's fucking Casey Cass? Casey fucking Cass? I love you, little one. Fuck. Yes, I'll be right there. These are the cards. Uh-Huh. They were playing a game, and it ended quite badly. So they came from the pub. All arrived together. Dennis Hoge, footballer from Leicester. No prior convictions as an adult; Billy, from Rockford, One of his teammates; Tanya, a waitress; Mike and Katie, American students, Just came over together from Los Angeles; Kim and Brenda, friends traveling together; And missy Dembree, An American studying in London... I thought you said you were working late. Oh, come on, Dennis. I don't do anything I don't want to do. You should know that. ...who didn't survive the evening. Walk me through the final dare. Whose idea was it for missy To go along with Dennis and mike? I think it was my idea. I said we should take a pretty girl along. So, let me get this right. When she was explained the game, she said her mother Shot herself in the neck. Is that right? Isn't that a bit of a coincidence? I mean, with the cards? What are we saying? That she was some kind of prophet? That she knew what was gonna happen? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me. When I got to London, She said she'd seen her own death In a dream, shot and bleeding. Freaky. Tell me about the game. Your game. It wasn't really my idea. The game was missy's idea. Truth or dare, essentially, But amped. Nc-17 version. The mystique was bullshit, But missy made it so convincing. To the art of spirituality. Well, hey, it's the truth. We're lying and getting away with it. Cheers. All right. This is how we begin. By the pricking of my thumb, something wicked this way comes. Oh, no way. Mike? Uh, no, I'll pass, thanks. Come on, mike. Don't be such a baby. I'd be careful if I were you. I mean, you never know when you'll get another chance, right? Son of a... is that even safe? I don't know. Has everyone been tested? "Something wicked this way comes"... That's Macbeth. Mm-Hmm. Remember how it ends? I do. It ends bloody. You know they say our throats are open graves, And with our tongues we speak deceit. You miss that? You wish. You can't get to me, sweetheart. I see right through you. Uh-Huh. Now what? We can't start the game until you drink this. What is it? Our blood. I'm in. Jesus! Absolutely vile. It was yummy. Nasty! Oh, guys, you ready? This is a game for adults, So if there's any kiddies in the house who want out, now would be the time. Is it scary? Only if you lie. I'm feeling good. Let's play. If it's unlawful, I'm in. It'd be nice to have one new year's Where you didn't puke on my furniture, Billy. So are there, like, prizes? Nope. Just penalties. Oh, miss, this is not gonna end well. Facebook snaps these are not. Oh, that's a real legacy you've got there, missy. It's sort of like a family heirloom passed down from my grandmother to my mother. And then to you. That's very cool. Yeah. I mean, my mom's not exactly around anymore, but... why? She shot herself in the neck, right? Yep. Bled to death. Since you crashed my party, missy, I was kind of hoping it'd be a lively time. Okay, guys, we'll go through the entire deck. You can pick a card. It's gonna be a dare or a question. If you get caught in a lie, you get penalized by me. So how will you know? That's my gift. Right, Dennis? Well, how do you win? You survive. You go right down to the end. Who's in? All right. Let's do it. One circle. Come on. Okay, Katie, your turn. I've never cheated on anyone. Liar! Your turn, Kim. When I go to strip clubs, I bring quarters instead of singles 'Cause I feel like the strippers definitely have a lot of laundry to do. You go, Brenda. Go girl! Whoo! Okay, your turn, Tania. Have I ever committed a crime? Tell us. Guess it's my turn. Uh, my turn? I think Katie's the one who needs education. Why did you come to London for the Christmas holidays? My parents are split, And it's messy at home. And I came because of mike. I just want things to suffer a bit. It's almost midnight. Save me a kiss? I'm sorry, but it'd just be so weird. Of course. Right. Christ. God, what is this magic hold That missy has over you, anyway? Can't you see that you're just some kind of pet for her? Thanks for your honesty, pal. Fuck. I kept hoping he'd come to his senses about missy And reconsider me. I love him, I guess. Cheers, cheers. Were you in love with her? If I loved her and I couldn't have her, That'd be motive, right? You're asking me? I'm so glad you're here. Whoa, mike! Tell me, what did you do to piss mike off? Uh, I suppose I had some things that he wanted. Um... some measure of wealth, Success, confidence. Most of all, I suppose, I had missy. And if he couldn't have her, Then I guess filming me with her Was the next best thing. Until we split. No, I think he hates me for leaving her, But he hates her more for still wanting me back. Whose turn is it? It's Dennis's turn. What? Hey. Whose turn is it? Uh, it's someone's turn. Uh, that would be you, d-Man. Boop! It's not my turn. All right. Monsieur? "Steal something of value from a complete stranger." So what, I'm supposed to rob someone? Ooh, and it can't be one of us. Right. Too risky. I can't do it. Really? Just like that, Dennis? Mr. Quitter? I'm not quitting. It's just... That's why they call it a dare. So I get arrested for filching some shit? If only. I'll go along. Make it seem like a college prank. If we take a pretty girl, we can pretty much get away with anything. I'll go as witness. And how about we up the stakes, And both you guys have to steal something? And when you come back, you'll get a reward. What kind of reward? Fuck it, all right? You get caught, it's a slap on the wrist. Me, it's in the news. I'm suspended. Casey leaves me. I lose everything. Oh! So what are we waiting for? Quiet. Guys, shh. Why are we stopping? All right. That'll do. What's a little breaking and entering among friends, right? Come on, mate. This is so illegal. Remind me again why we're doing this. - Please be careful. - Mike, come on. That's my jersey. Take it off. What? It was cold. And besides, It's the least you owe me, right... A little souvenir? You are seriously bent. I'd make a decent thief. Hey, how's Casey, Dennis? She miss you? Look, you have got to release those claws, all right? I'm in love with her. It's happening. Dennis, I'm sorry, but I know you, And you're gonna get bored within 5 minutes and then what's gonna happen? You're delusional. You're not gonna let this go, are you? Turn it off, mike. I've never made you any promises, miss. That's true, but consequences mean more than promises. I mean, they can't exactly bend. That sounds like something that Michael would say. That's 'cause I did say it. It's a real shame we never had a proper goodbye fuck. Maybe I should leave you two alone. No, we need you as a witness. Yeah, keep the camera rolling. I don't think I'd trust myself if you didn't. No, keep it off. Come on. I dare you. Anyone here? Hello? Hello? Hurry up! But there's nothing here to load it. I found a watch. There's some cash in here. Not much. Ah! Bloody hell! What was that for? Why'd you hit him? Happy new year, Dennis. Fucking bitch. Put it away. It's not even loaded. It is now. Missy, you weren't supposed to load it. Give me your cell phone. Okay, easy, missy. Just come on. Do it. Are you in on this too, you prick? You know what? You are so fucking unbelievable. You think you can just forget about me? That I'm that disposable? Right, here it is. What do you want? I'm gonna call Casey from your cell phone, tell her we were pregnant. She wants to marry you after that, fine. That's her business. But I am sick of you lying about this. Is that your plan? To destroy me? Call my girl? It's a start. What do you really want, miss? Really? What do I want, Dennis? What do I want? How about I want you to tell everybody The fucking truth about us? I took care of it. Oh, really? $500, huh? You think that's gonna take care of it? 500 fucking dollars? You think that's taking care of it? I'm not even sure it was mine. You take that back. All right. Cranky psycho bitch. Dennis, shut your mouth! You're not helping! What, do you think she's gonna blow you now? Be your one true love? It's ringing. Hi, babe. Hey, you're not gonna believe this. Hi, Casey. You wouldn't believe this. It's actually missy, Dennis's ex-Girlfriend. Dennis, are you okay? No, actually, I'm not. These two are really... Jesus fuck! What happened? Missy's dead! Dennis shot her! Dennis shot her! Shut up! Shut up! She came up here and killed herself. No, Dennis did it! You're insane. So, it wasn't a suicide? They struggled, and the gun went off. He shot her. You positive? Yes. Can we be done? Are you serious? Look, you could call it an accident. But he wanted to be rid of her. He wanted her dead. You stopped filming before the robbery. Can you step out from behind the camera? Why was that? Dennis told me to. Oh, you do everything Dennis tells you to? No. The gun went off in Dennis's hand. That could be considered manslaughter, right? Dennis told one of my colleagues that you brought the gun for missy. Me? No, she got the gun out of the bedroom. I just went along because I... I don't know. I mean, the guy's such a cocky fuck. I just liked the idea of rattling his cage a bit. Did he tell you that he's the one who taught her how to use the gun? How did missy meet Dennis? Dennis had dropped out of school. He got lucky with soccer. Missy wrote me, bragging about this soccer stud And all their sordid details. So what brought you back to London from I.A.? "Back"? You came in September, right, to visit missy. So how come you're back so soon? "All other things to their destruction draw; Only our love hath no decay." Do you know that poem? I miss you. No, you miss this. You are so filthy. Oh, mike, you're such a cub scout. Hey, um, are you coming back for college? 'Cause dorm space is kind of filling up. I don't really know yet. I haven't really thought about it. Why don't you come for new year's? We can talk about it. I don't know if I can. Things are kind of tight. Katie friended me on facebook. She wants to come. So get on that. Plus Dennis just got this amazing place in south Kensington. He's even letting me fix it up. You are? Yep. I mean, my good taste and his cash... We can go all the way, right? Plus he's high scorer now, which means he got that, like, Golden boot thing and probably even go premier at this point. That's great, but seriously, when's the last time the guy read a book? Sorry, got to go. Miss, I was wondering if you... I'll call you later. Was being filmed a turn-On for missy? Yeah, I suppose. She wanted me to record everything. So glad that we came. Hello. How've the boys been? Dude. Yo, mike, why don't you step out from behind the camera for once? What? Is it really that much harder... yes, it's his shield. Entitles you to the intimacy you want but can't have. Smart girl. But if I can't have it, Why not watch it? Because it ain't real. The camera sees all. Like this? Bit of a cassavetes, are we? That would just be presumptuous. For someone so self-Deprecating? I just like getting what's real. I suppose I hadn't meant it to get this real. What did you do when you first arrived here for the holidays? I left Katie at the hotel, And I went straight to missy's. Mike, you shouldn't be here. I just want to kill myself. Stop it. Come on. God, I love you. I swear, mike, you're the closest thing I've ever had to a brother. Whoa, mike! I'm sorry. What the fuck do you think you're doing? I'm sorry. I just... I think you deserve better. You know everything Dennis could give you, I could give you that. Mike... this is not what I want from you. Okay? Jesus. Couldn't you just one day see us becoming... No! All right? No, no, no. You and me, we are friends, all right? That is all we are ever going to be. God! M... Missy. Just... remember that one day in New York... Yes. Yes, mike. Almost, okay? It never happened because there's gonna be mistakes. So will you just fucking forget about that? I can't. You didn't tell Dennis that you and I fooled around, did you? No. Mike... No, I didn't. Why does... why does he hate me? Missy, I... i look at you, and I could be anything That Dennis, could be And I would do anything to be in his place. No, fuck you, mike. I want you out. Okay? You said you'd come here to help me, And now you're fucking hitting on me? You think that's what I need? I'm serious. Go. I would've been good to you. I loved her, So I got as close as I could. So how well did you know missy? We were roommates. Lived in a house with some other friends. She was my real education. He said I wanted to string on one, any of them, Anything to show that superior simpering composure. Why did he bring missy on the evening? He didn't. She got there ahead of us. He kind of liked it, though. Her never backing down, competing for him. We've got dance, we've got dance music. Katie and I planned to meet missy at work on new year's eve. Nice little pub where Dennis and his friends hang out. Come inside. What? All right. Hey. Hey. So we're cool, huh? Yeah. New year, right? Hey, girl. Good to see you here. Hi. We're going places, mate. No, don't be daft. I mean, You know what they paid Robinho to transfer to real Madrid? Lot of cash? 30 million. Oh, where's Dennis? Place is a mess. I've just moved in. Who is this? Uh, it's Tanya, Dennis. Missy's friend? Oh, fuck. I hope you get your goddamn curtains. I'll be right back. Okay. All right. Let's drink our faces off. I'm Billy. You party? Well, that depends. You convince Dennis to come along, and I'm in. If he doesn't mind his ex tagging along, that is. No, no, no. Tanya's all right, but no missy, all right? She's... she's mental, all right? I swear to god she's gone balmy. Oh, come on, bad boy. All right, fuck it, right? But no missy, all right? All right. All right. Let's go in. Yeah. Come on. Oh, so this is your fuck-Able London crowd, huh? Yep. Bankers and yuppie losers and... he's cute. Yeah. And he likes Americans. Whoa! You girls look thirsty! That's right. So thirsty. Cheers. Okay, cross. Cross, cross. Drink. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Daddy, daddy, daddy. That tickles! Can I get one more? Blondie! What's up, surfer girl? Dude, what the fuck? Come on, we know you want to play! Get off me, you stupid fuck. Let her go. You'd better calm the fuck down! Told you missy's party's gone for fucking males. I'm not here for you, Dennis. I'm here for missy. Fine, whatever. You ever seen her like this? No. I'm mean, she's always been intense. She's an artist. Oh, please. What'd she say to you? She said at the time he was nothing, And so she's going to destroy me. You asked for it. We broke up. It happens, all right? I didn't ask for this insanity. Why don't you stop being a dick to her, man. I tried. If she wants to detonate her own life, fine, But if she's gonna bring me down with it, that's another story. Okay, she's coming back after the holidays, And I am done with this shit. Oh, hey! Rikki and Brenda, the shot-Glass sisters. Oh, yeah, nice. You survived. Where are you from? Come with us, and we'll tell you. Come on. So, I suppose missy Was trying to get you back in the sack. Yeah, absolutely. She's kind of a terror in bed. Sort of scary. Mm. Which is cool. But, no, this thing with Casey is real. I'm not that reckless. No. Of course. Glad we could do this. It's gorgeous. I'm so happy for you. I'm so happy. So, dad, this is your future son-In-Law. Right, Dennis? Um, do you know I have, um... I'll be right back, all right? Of course. See you in a bit, all right? Do you think he was having second thoughts? No. No, Casey's the brass ring. Pedigree family. Third-Generation money. Superstardom. Dennis is a pig like that. He's drawn to the trough. So, booze, hash, class as? Yeah. Billy was like Santa Claus. Everyone cooperated just like that? Yeah. You'd be surprised how far people go to keep the thrills alive. Your doctor is in the house. Orange if you're feeling lethargic; Yellow for a mellow ride; And my personal favorite, Sky blue for just general purpose. All right. Mellow yellow. Hey, babe. Miss you. I'm gonna go outside. I can't hear you. I can't hear. I'll steal outside, all right? Shit. No way. What is it? I don't know. "Pick a witness, and in front of him or her, Pleasure yourself." I'm not doing that. What are you... who are you taking? I'm not... Okay, Dennis. What? All right, fine. What a wuss. All right, let's go. Fuck you, man. I'm kidding. Come on, sweetheart. What, are you chickenshit? All right, we'll see you in a few minutes. I am not rubbing one out in front of you, man. No shit, but I need to talk to you. What is missy's plan? This game, this night? I know it's a big "fuck you," but what's the climax? I don't know. Why do you keep protecting her? You know she only keeps you around 'cause you're a sweet fucking convenience. Nice try. "Ordinary riches can be stolen. Real riches cannot." You know the quote? No fucking clue what you're talking about. Didn't expect you to. What are you playing at? Huh? What is it? You know, I... I don't get the sense of entitlement. Like others are dispensable. You deserve it all. It's worked pretty well so far. Your problem is, Michael, that you care too much. So, tell me, What is missy planning? Why should I? What is it? Don't know. But picture it. They're both so young. Guys, it's pretty basic. You've done it before. He didn't do it. Missy says you have to finish the dare. Katie wanted to help. Oh, uh, no. You a yummy. He's yummy, isn't he, Bren? Yeah, positively. It's miss you want, isn't it? Well... yeah, but that's not happening. Well, why don't we finish you off? What? Uh, now? Yeah. Oh! Wait, wait, wait. What-What? That kind of feels... yeah? It feels like an ambush here. It is. You know? It's a honey drop. Yeah? Tell me what you want. What would you like? Okay, relax. So you had the camera? This card has time code September 6. You must've been recording her first flush of love. Can't be much fun for you. No. # The three of us are stuck love struck # # Never know who to trust or when I've had enough # # What do we do when we're through all the broken rules # # Am I just a fool for the drama that comes up? # # A single kiss, a narrow miss # # The bullet and the target is the hardest to hit # # I should quit but I can't get you outta my head # Pretty good with a gun. Call me the bonnie to your Clyde. # What do I do? # I'm stuck in the middle of the moth and her flame # # Waitin' for a new day that never comes # # What do I do? # I'm stuck in the middle of the moth and her flame # # Playing games, waitin' for a new day # # That never comes # Please wait # Think about tomorrow # And the next girl that he's gonna follow # # I can take care of you # Do dares with you play fair with you # # Anywhere you choose anywhere you choose # # I'll follow your rules to the ends of the earth # # Even if it means I'm the one who gets hurt... # # Even if it means... # What do I do? # I'm stuck in the middle of the moth and her flame # # Waitin' for a new day # That never comes # What do I do? # I'm stuck in the middle of the moth and her flame # Listen, mate, um, Could we get you to leave us alone for a minute? Yeah. Might need that. Oh, right. See you in a couple of hours. All right. Oh, you are so ridiculously hot. # What do I do? # What do I do? # What do I do? But you weren't in the room? No. You watched it later? Well, yeah. She knew you would. I guess so. How would you feel about Dennis Hoge going to jail for the murder of missy Dembree? Well, that's what happens when you commit a crime, right? What the hell? Whoops. Just testing your athleticism. Stop fucking around, mate. Come on, I dare you. Found a watch. This doesn't look good, Dennis. Breaking and entering, theft. You being a championship player and all. Yeah, no shit. Are you nuts? Here's the real dare, Dennis. You're gonna call Casey. You're gonna tell her the truth about missy. You're gonna tell her that you lied And that you got missy pregnant and broke her heart. Oh, boo-Fucking-Hoo. Not a chance. That's mine. It's not even loaded. That was really cute, how you kept the bullets with the condoms, right? Little extra protection, even though everybody knows you don't use anything at all. You love her, mike. Say it. But she doesn't love you back. All you're gonna get from her is conversation. Shut up! Mike, he doesn't know anything about us. Give me the cell phone. I'm gonna call Casey. That's not happening. Put down the gun, mike. Let go of me. Let her go. Let her go! Suicide. That's our story. It will keep you out of jail. Why would missy kill herself? She's mad jealous about Casey. Some sick form of revenge, I guess. I can think of easier forms. She was a stalker. She was calling me, My agent, the press. Trying to get to Casey, tell 'em all sorts of shit. That she was pregnant with your child? Exactly. It's all lies. I wouldn't be that stupid. No. Why? What did mike tell you? Oh, he said you shot her. That's fucking insane. No fucking way. It wasn't a suicide, was it, Dennis? She had marks on her neck and arms. Signs of bruising. Plus we know you called Casey Cass from the hotel. If you want, I can get her down and we can talk to her right now. No, don't do that, please. Or I can keep all of this quiet. Your game's up, superstar. You lie to me now, you're in deep shit or worse. You're on trial for fucking murder. Shit. It was an accident. Mike... thought it was a bluff. The gun wasn't supposed to be loaded. He wrestled it away from missy. Blam, it went off. He shot her. But it was an accident. Dennis said it was an accident. Dennis said The gun was in mike's hand, and it just went off. I wasn't there, but... I don't think mike does anything accidentally. He's too anal. So you think he meant to kill her? No. Doesn't add up. He loved her too much. Maybe sometimes loving someone too much can be dangerous. Maybe. Wake up, mike. I think it's your turn. Oh, come... "Explain your first experience. Describe your first lover." Tell us, mike. Yeah, give us the details. Okay, I was... high school. I was dating this girl, Julie Tate. We were in a theater group, Performing at this weekend festival, and... "There are daggers in men's smiles, The near in blood, the nearer bloody." I like that. She was this super-Hot lady Macbeth, And we managed to do it Backstage standing up in tights and these Big renaissance velvet robes, so... Whoo! Yeah. That's really sweet, but, um, something's telling me That you are a... A liar. I thought you would back me up. What are you, embarrassed? Come on, just tell us, dude. It's true. It's true. You did do it with Julie, But... i was your first lover. You're kid... Mike, why didn't you tell me that? Come on. I was trying to protect you. I don't need protecting. Okay, fine. Katie and I have been friends since we were kids. Just play dates and birthdays and later, yearbook club. We were just really good friends in high school, And one night we had a few beers and stumbled into more. Yeah, and you know what? It kind of actually looked A little something like this. Oh. Okay. I think they get it, Katie. Fine, fine. Whatever. My parents walked in, and it was coitus interruptus. Yes, which is why we have been friends ever since. That means we just caught you in a lie. Get up and sing. Mm. It's not bad. # 525,600 minutes # 525,000 # Moments so dear I have a question for you. Did mike give you his camera when you were at the fire escape? Be careful. Yeah, I think so. What is it with you students? I mean, how bored must you be? Way bored. Trouble is, life's mostly false when you're sober. I mean, we're all liars. Behaving well, Seeking the approval of parents, Teachers, peers. The truth only comes out when you Shed the inhibitions, Take a risk. So, are you lying now? Nope. I told you mike had this awful crush on missy, right? Well, I guess he agreed to help her use this game To get between me and Casey. Thank you. But, I mean, it wasn't his fault. She stole my gun and brought it along for this stupid game of hers. That'll help his case. Then she pointed it at me, threatening. Said she wanted to destroy me. She was trying to get between me and Casey. Was mike filming at the time? No, not at the hotel. How did this whole thing end between you and missy? I broke up with her, But she was in total denial. She kept coming round at all hours, stalking. And then when news of my engagement to Casey Hit the press, she just snapped. Perhaps she thought she was the one, poor sausage. I never told her that, I swear. We were just having a bit of fun. Fuck! How did you find us? Oh, I'm sorry. You don't think Casey knows me? We have so much in common, don't we? You fucking stalker. I will call you, I promise. Oh, right, right. Just like you promised the last time and the time before that? Shh! If you don't let go of me, I swear to god I'll scream. How fucking dare you? This is not over. Hey. What is it? Oh, nothing. I just, uh... I had nerves in my stomach. Had to step out for some air. Um, can I talk to you for a second? Um... um, I've never had a home like this. I've mostly grown up alone, Hard-Done and frequently hung over. It's all a bit new to me, so... well, I do love you. My family already loves you. Which makes you lucky. Very lucky. I won't let anything come between us. Promise me that. I promise. I do like the way it feels. And this too. You know, I saw you play once. At northrup. Great corner. Ah, you saw that? You're one hell of a striker. I do what I can. You can't take that shot from behind bars. So tell me about the game. Adolesens mendio. That's Latin for "I tell lies." Whatever. Looks like it's time for Dennis to cleanse his soul. Two raw eggs to symbolize innocence. And a little bit of my spit. You know, a little accusation before your redemption. You are making this up as you go. Is that why I came here, missy? To cleanse my soul? Oh, I don't think that'll do it, Dennis. Did you see that? Are you okay? Yeah, sure. I feel born again. Clean, like. Oh, that's gross, Dennis? Dennis? What the fuck? All right. Billy. Billy. Nice to meet you. D- Man, d-Licious, d-Lightful. We're actually all right. Yeah, man. Very good. Come here for a second. I'm rolling on the "e" train is what's going on here. You've got something... oh, that feels so good right there. Right, yeah. Just like that. You know. Right, did you bring the... yeah, yeah. Right here. Sorry, man. Got a little caught up. Oh, is that all you brought me? "Is that all"? I like that. Hey, check it out. Lead cock going on here. I mean, I'm a lapsed catholic, but I got to believe... you've got to believe in something or someone. Otherwise, what's the point? You all think too much. That's the antidote. That's naughty. Strong-Arm. So stupid! Shit. Sorry. Hey, what's the matter? I just thought that, um, Mike and I would finally... No, no, no. He's an idiot. Stay with me. I thought you were engaged to this Casey Cass. No, I am. Yeah, but we're not married. All right, look. See, uh, Katie has a thing for mike, And maybe she was just using me to get to him, I don't know, but things got messy. What? No. No, no, no. Come here, come here. Just for a second. Come on. Come on. We're just swaying to the music. That's fine. You're all right. Have a little dance. There it is. Don't. Katie, come on, come on. What's the matter? You can't just grab what you want. You're such a dick head. I'm a dick head? All right. You might make him jealous, you know. He always wants what I have. God, arrogant much? You... Tell you what. You let me touch you in three Perfectly appropriate places, And if you still don't want a kiss, I will let you walk away un-Harrassed. Don't. What... What's the matter? No, just... Katie, what... Just stop it! Katie? Katie, are you sure you don't want company? Did he hurt you? Back off. Easy, mate. Just warming her up for you. You are such an ass. Casey's not enough, huh? Missy? You got to have everyone? You're lucky I don't just end you. Yeah, lucky. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey. What's going on? You okay? What just happened? What happened? Are you okay? Are you all right? Yeah. Fuckin' asshole. Oh, god. Come here, give me a kiss. Oh, my god! Gotcha! All right. Oh, my god. Hey, sorry about earlier. Maybe it's just you and I. Yeah, I'm sober now. Dennis, my darling sexy-Face. Are you going? Thanks for a wonderful pre-Party. You're absolutely welcome. All right, all right. Have a good time, mate. Come on. Just give me a kiss, all right? No. Don't think so. He's mine. It was a party. Everyone was getting really excited, and... now who's staring? ...things happened. Just mike, Katie and missy. Come on. Billy was there too, but he was tied up. So tell me about this threesome. It was Dennis, Katie and missy. Cut me loose. It's all right, Katie. We've got you. Wait. Wait. Guys, she's scared. Help. What are you actually charging me with? Drug use, reckless endangerment, breaking and entering, And that's all, to start with. Did you tell him the truth? I did. Your loss. Hey, premier league. This is exactly the kind of press that can kill a career. It's your gun, victim's blood on your shirt, big, fat fucking motive. Fuck you. Fuck me? No, fuck you. Did mike hate Dennis enough to play along With missy's little game? I think mike would do anything missy asked. Dennis destroyed her by falling for Casey, And she wanted to destroy him right back. May I? Oh. Who did that? It was stupid. It was just a dare. Really. I just played along. Who was it? Missy. Was mike there? No. But Dennis was. Wait. Wait. Shit. Guys, she's scared. Oh, god. Come on, beauty cans. It's just a game. Oh, yeah. Well? What happened? It was a little anticlimactic. I need a drink. We found mike and Dennis's prints, But we could only get a partial... Not enough for missy. What are you saying? Were you ever in Dennis's bedroom? Yeah, briefly. Is there anything you'd like to tell me about that? Did you ever hold this gun? No. I didn't. You didn't like missy, did you? Why was that? I didn't like the hypnotic Hold that she had over mike. The manipulation. He always made her out to be such a princess. And she wasn't? Look, I'm no prize, But missy, man, She was like poison. She had this whole Artsy, black-As-Death thing. Self-Destructive, needy, "Kiss me, love me, hurt me." I don't know, but the guys ate it up. You can't teach that. What about Dennis? Were you into him? Sort of. Quintessential bad boy. You know the type? Regrettably. So Dennis tells me that You two almost got together. I was high. Almost made a big mistake. Almost. You don't mind me despising you? What stopped you? All your life, People tell you about your... potential, Your... brains, Your beauty, And you want it all to be true. And then you go off to college with all that in your head. Your freedom to find it. But it doesn't come easily. And... it's lonely. And... and you don't want to tell anyone that You're failing Or how scared you are. Then... someone touches this button deep, Deep inside which says, "It's okay to compromise. "It's okay to at least "Feel good, To feel wanted." You fear you may lose yourself. But with the right touch On the right night In the right fog of chemically induced delirium, The pleasure seems worth the pain, And you risk it. Did you hear me? I said, "if you keep going, I'll hate you." Why would I care? Because you're part of the human race, you soulless degenerate. Uh-Huh. That's right. Pleasure me. You have to have some moral obligation. Saddam Hussein started out drowning cats. All right. Fuck it. Seriously. And he killed people because they too were an inconvenience. Saddam? I'm not fucking drowning cats. But you are. Come here. You're an overeducated cunt. Educate this! You know, Katie, you're the first American I've ever liked. Maybe that's 'cause I'm from Canada. Did missy ever return mike's affection? Sex, you mean? I... i don't know. She had the hook in him deep. Kept pretending one day she'd finally reel him in. Do you think Dennis would go to the extent of killing missy Just to protect his own... interests, his future? Is that what mike said? You go first. I mean, I don't know. Seems nothing is more important To Dennis than Dennis. We found the camera empty. So, the way I see it, Either that means, mike, that you opted Not to shoot footage in the hotel, Because that would've been evidence, Or you got rid of it. There's no footage. Is that true? I'll tell you what is true. She lied to all of you. Missy never had an abortion. Hospital has it down as a miscarriage. And I'll tell you what else we found out too. Her mother was institutionalized for most of her life. Missy herself was on lithium and tegretol, Which are both prescribed for manic depression. She also tried to kill herself twice: Once with an overdose of paracetamol; Another time with something much sharper: A knife. That doesn't change the fact that Dennis killed her. There's more than one way to do that, right? He broke her. Blaming him won't bring her back, mike. Yeah, give it up, mate. Sit down. I think missy wanted Dennis to watch her die. She didn't dream of that, mike. She planned it. Think about it. She set up the dare. Loading the gun, leaving Dennis's shirt behind as evidence. It was a suicide, And she wanted Dennis to take the blame. Mike? Yeah. Okay. Hello? What are you doing? Missy? You have no idea how much I love you, Dennis. And if you don't want to be with me, I'm gonna make this really easy on both of us. Missy, no. Oh, god! Oh, god! I'm gonna tell 'em you shot her. That's what she wanted... To destroy you! What? Fuck that. You're the love-Struck Romeo. What's going on? Open up. Easy, mate. I wanted you all to remember this Next time you're looking for a thrill. What the hell, Dennis? You let her into your house? No, she broke in, all right? She's a stalker. Jesus, what would my parents say? And she was pregnant? It's not... could we talk about this outside, please? Okay, so you are Both free to go. Are you here for long? Yeah, I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna stay for a bit. Just kind of tour by myself And clear my head. That's a good idea. Take care of yourself. Okay. Thank you. I'm gonna go over there. You know, I would've loved to have met her. Yeah. Yeah, I think that she would've said the truth is hard to come by. Yeah, but we'd all be lost without it, wouldn't we? I suppose. So what are you doing now? Back to college? Um... yeah. One more year. You might like this. There's one card still inside. Smart girl, that missy. Good luck. Dennis deserved so much worse. I know you loved her, But you can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved. Yeah, I guess not. She should've been mine. What? Missy left one card. What does it say? "What would it take for you to kill someone?" She knew exactly what it would take for her. Um, Will you take it? Yeah. Let's get out of here. Morning. Good morning. Yeah, indeed. Thank you. Mm-Hmm, goodbye. I'm feeling good. Let's play. Whose turn is it? It's Dennis's turn. What? It should be just a few moments, miss. Thank you. Glad you're here, mate. Missy's party train's gone off the fucking rails. So, are you lying now? Nope. Will you take it? Turn that camera off, mike. Aha. Found a watch. Congrats. Hey, Dennis. Yeah? Surprise. The real dare starts now. Oh, is that true? Oh, shit, mike, that's my gun. It's not loaded. Actually, it is. Miss, miss, we... I'm gonna fuck your life up the way you fucked up mine, Dennis. You're gonna feel the pain that I felt and lose the way I lost. I got Casey's number in my phone, and I'm gonna call her, And you're gonna tell her exactly what happened between us, you lying prick. That's not happening. You should've been nicer to mike. He might've actually got away with this. Mike, what the... Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck are you... You're not going to fuck with me anymore, all right? Mike, what the... This wasn't... Bye, bye, missy. I'm not gonna help you anymore, Because you chose Dennis, Not me. Game over. We were just supposed to scare her. We were just supposed to scare her away! Don't be naive, mike. She said she wanted to die. You have to be careful what you wish for. I can't believe it. Believe it. It's happened. It was a suicide, right? A suicide. Let's get out of here. No. Hey, Casey. Shit. # Drive me insane # But I like it # I like it like that # I don't need a sign # 'cause I see it # When I look in your eyes # I can't explain # But it feels good # Feels good to me # You drive me insane # But I like it # I like it like that # This don't mean nothing # But it could tear you apart # # This don't mean nothing # Why is it breaking your heart # # Don't analyze # Sometimes # You leave me alone # Don't ask me why # 'cause there's no way # No way to describe # You drive me insane # This don't mean nothing # Why does it tear you apart # # This don't mean nothing # Why does it tear you apart # # I don't care if you never get it # # It's not fair and I never said it was # # It's just the way it is # I won't fight it's too late to listen # # You're not right and I'm not a victim # # No # It's just the way it is # I've had enough # I'm gonna let you go # You can leave me now # You can walk away and break my heart # # I don't need you now # Turn around and tear my world apart # # You can beg, you can cry but I made up my mind # # There'll be no next time this time # # So just let me know # 'cause I don't want you around to drag me down #
