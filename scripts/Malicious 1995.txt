Yeah, now throw it back to me. I got the ball! Who's gonna be in the big leagues, Dougie? I'm gonna play baseball. Pow! You see that? Tell Mom what you're gonna do. What are you gonna play? I'm gonna play big baseball. And you're gonna be the one, kiddo. That's great, honey. I wanna throw the ball. Come on, Dougie. Come back over here. I want you to stay there. I'll stay here. You throw me the ball. It went all the Way over there. That's wonderful. Now throw it back. I want... - I got the bat, Mom! - Okay, Watch this. Hold tight. Keep your eye on the ball. That's it. I don't believe it. Swing, batter, batter, batter. Swing the bat. Throw the ball! Swing the bat. Yeah! Here, bat the ball again. Good one! - I hit the ball. - You hit the ball, slugger. I hit the ball! Good one, Dougie! Low and inside. Mendez is one of the league's great southpaws. More sporadic today. Last time these two teams met, he threw a perfect game. Here's the pitch. Strike! I don't know about that. I thought that was a little high. I think Gordon did, too. The crowd's not happy with that one, but Gordon's not contesting. He's waiting for the big one. Bingo! It's going! It's going! IT'S gone! Guess who? Hey- What is this? - Are you gonna keep this stupid thing? - Yeah. - Why? - Come here. For this. Stop it. It tickles. Oh, hey, I got you something. What? What is it? Open it. A bat? Yeah, but look at what it says. "Home Run 100, Doug Gordon." It must mean a lot to you. It does. That's Why I gave it to you. Thanks. Well, all I've got for you is some good news. What, you're not gonna leave me alone this Weekend? No, but you're off the hook tonight. Dinner's canceled. My dad had to fly off to Tokyo last minute. At least I could use the extra time. I could put it to some studying. You still cramming? Do you have any idea how many bones there are in a single human hand? No, Dr. Gordon. Why don't you tell our studio audience and all our friends at home. How many bones are there? Very funny. Here we are today with Dr. Gordon, preeminent sports physician and doctor to the stars. Dr. Gordon, is it true that your lovely girlfriend Laura was instrumental in your early success as a student of sports medicine? Well, I would have to say it was more her unwavering loyalty, her understanding, and, of course, her sexual prowess. Honey? What? We're in a library. There's nobody here. Come on, nobody's gonna see us. I'm not gonna see you again. It'll be exciting. Come on. We never have any time alone. Jesus. I'm sorry. Stupid. It's okay. I overreacted a little. Well, I better get going. I've got a long drive ahead of me. Okay. Call you later, okay? Bat. - Good luck with your interview. - Thanks. I'll call you as soon as I get there. Hey, Dougie! Where you been? I was in the library. Oh, yeah. What's that? You see that big building over there? It's got, like, books inside it. And people go there and they read. Oh, yeah, I think I've been there once or twice. So, what's up, bud? No big date tonight? No, not for this guy. Although Jay and Dean called. They're throwing a big party at the beach tonight. - You're gonna have to tell me all about it. - Oh, come on. - The whole team's gonna be there. - I can't. Why? Laura have other plans for you tonight? No. Actually she's away for a couple days. All right. So you're a free man. No, man, I can't. I got tons of studying I have to do. And I promised my mom I'd go outwith her tonight. Now it's your mother? Look, man, she's not doing too good since my dad died. You know? I'm sorry, man. I forget sometimes. - You all right? - Yeah. It's cool. - It's cool. - All right. Look, it's early yet, all right? We Walk in and out, say hello. Ten minutes, that's all I ask of you. - I can't. - Oh, come on! Come on. Ten minutes. Please. We Walk in and out. Well, you've been Working your ass off. - All right. Ten minutes. - Yeah? - Ten. That's it. - Sure? - Okay? I'm positive. - All right. Good. - All right. - See you then? - See you then. - All right. Hey, Doug! Yeah! Doug! Hey, Doug, did Laura find you? Yeah, I was in the library. Yeah, can you believe that? Just like that she gets a call for Stanford. One minute they're being aloof. And the next thing, they want you to drop everything. Don't they realize we have lives, too? I think it's a really big pain in the... Doug. Hey, thanks for getting me into Lesher's class. - I appreciate it. - No problem. It'll be nice to have you in the class. Just make sure you know the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, 'cause Lesher can be a real hard ass. Did he tell you We're dissecting a cadaver next Week? I can't wait. - Hey, what are you drinking? - Cuba libre. - Beer's over there. - I'll see you later. - I'll see you later. - Nice, dude. Here he is, folks. This is Doug Gordon. He is the breaker of records and hearts alike. - Cocktail? - No, thanks. You know we have a game tomorrow. Remember? Yes, but tomorrow is a very long Way away. Now... I want you to gaze before you, Doug. I want you to tell me what you see. A reggae band? Babes, Doug. I'm talking about women. Wait a second. Pardon me. I've been on Prozac for a month and my thighs are swelling. And I was wondering if you knew anything about... Hi, Doug. Do I know you? No. But everyone here seems to know you. Small town. Baseball team, you know. - Want a cigarette? - No, thanks. I don't smoke. They're American Heritage. All natural. No chemicals. They're practically good for you. I like your beard. Oh, thanks. Makes you look kind of like Mark McGwire. - You know Mark McGwire? - Oakland A's. 229 home runs, 632 RBIs. - You're into baseball. - Obsessed. - I guess you play. - Yeah. Do you go to Bellport? - Second year med school. - Last year pre med. I'm Melissa, by the way. Hi, Melissa. So... What brings you here? I mean, you... You seem above all this nonsense. You don't like parties? No, they're all right. It's just... Have a lot of studying I should be doing. And I have to write my MCAT soon. Welcome to a new dimension in misery. What's your major? Major League Baseball, hopefully. But kinesiology and anatomy. Anatomy? My favorite. Okay. So tell me about your girlfriend. Who says that I have a girlfriend? Oh, come on. Guys like you always do. Unless, of course, they don't like girls. What do you want to know about it? Well... How long have you been going out? Three years. Really? Something like that. Yeah. Serious? Yeah, I guess so. Thanks for the cigarette. Hey, what's your hurry? Excuse me? The night's young. Why don't we go somewhere? - Like Where? - Anywhere you Want. I don't think so. I mean, you seem like a really nice person. But, like I said, I'm seeing someone. Then Why are you here at this party without her? She's got a big interview this weekend. Stanford School of Journalism. - Stanford? - Yeah. Impressive. So how long is she gonna be gone for? - A few days. - Gonna miss her? Yeah, sure. Doesn't sound very convincing. I should go. I have a game tomorrow. It was really nice meeting you. See you around, slugger. Shit. You looking for these? - Where did you find those? - On the dock. You must have dropped them. - Thanks. - Wait a minute. - Are you okay to drive? - Yeah, I'm fine. I don't know. I saw you drinking a lot in there. Thank you, but I'm fine. - Okay, touch your nose. - What? Come on, like this. Touch your nose. Very good. Now with your tongue. Very funny. Can I have my keys, please? You don't have much of a sense of humor, do you? - I have a terrific sense of humor. - Oh, yeah? Yeah, if I run down one more old lady, I win a prize. Now give me my keys, please. My mother was run over by a drunk driver. Okay, so We're going with Pete. I don't like him. He's gross. Doug? Hey, I'm sorry about your mother. I didn't know. I was only kidding. My parents are divorced. You should have seen your face. That's very funny. It's a nice car. It's my stepfather's. I'm just borrowing it. You know, I didn't want you to think I was some kind of princess or something. So Where is your dad, anyway? - Alaska. - Yeah? I heard it's supposed to be really beautiful there. So you wanna fuck? What? Fuck. If you like, I can demonstrate. I already told you I have a girlfriend. I don't know. Let's see. Your mouth says no, but your body... well, it's saying something else, isn't it? Number five. Left fielder, Doug Gordon. Batter up. Come on, Doug. You're up. Knock it out. This is the one, now. Nice and easy. Way to Watch it, Doug! Way to Watch it. Good eye! Strike! Gordon does it again. That's the 44th of the year and 101 for his career. Way to go, Gordon. And the final score today: Bobcats 11, Express 10. - Hey, Gary! Wait up, buddy! - Hey, Robert! Stealing more hearts, I see. And here I was thinking I was something special. - What are you doing here? - I'm Lesher's T.A. What are you doing here? I just switched from Beckman's class. It was too close to practice. Oh, so now you're following me. Funny. I suppose you'll be Wanting these back. Oh, yeah. You were quite impressive. - Thanks. - At your game today. - You were at the game? - That was some hit. Yeah, if only this stuff came as easy, I'd be all right. Maybe you just need a tutor. I wouldn't go that far. I would, given your grades. Oh, so now you're looking at my grades, huh? Hey, look, I'm having a problem with my fielding. Can you take care of that for me, too? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was posing a threat to your masculinity. Who said you were posing a threat to my masculinity? Look, when you're through trying to impress yourself, I'll see you at my house, 7:00. If the directions are too difficult, my phone number's there, too. Melissa. Yes, Dr. Lesher. Remind me to schedule a meeting with Dr. Marcus. Oh, really? What? Hi, this is Doug. You know what to do when you hear the beep. Thanks. Hi, Doug. It's Laura. Just thinking of you. I'll try you later. Say hi to your mom. Melissa? - Hi. - Hi.. Something Wrong? Yeah, I just having a really bad day. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Listen, why don't we just go somewhere else? At least we won't be bothered there. Tricuspid valve, carneae, tendinae, and the lining is endocardium and myocardium. Good. But don't forget the epicardium. Yeah, right. Hey, I really appreciate this... you know, helping me out like this. Especially after... Don't worry about it. - Is this your father? - Yeah, when he was young. Long time ago. Before he was married. He loved baseball. It's all he ever wanted to do. He was good enough for the pros, too. Just like you, Doug. Why didn't he play? He had a decision to make. My mother hated the travel and the lifestyle, so she gave him an ultimatum, and he took it. He became a surgeon. I'm not this open with everyone. I don't know, it's strange. I feel different with you. I'm sorry, I should just shut up. You know the other night? In the car? I'm not usually like that. I don't know what I was thinking. I guess I was just afraid. Afraid of what? Afraid of not knowing what it would be like to know you. To be with you. Why don't you come in for a drink? I gotta go. I'll call you. Are you up for sailing this Weekend? It's supposed to be really beautiful. I'm really busy. I know this great little island. It's just a couple of hours from here. Do you wanna stay the night? I have an extra set of pajamas. Listen... why don't we just lay low for a little while? I mean... I wasn't expecting any of this. It's just... I got a lot of things I gotta figure out. And... I still have a girlfriend. And I still don't care. Yeah, but I think Laura might. Laura? That's her name? Laura? Well, Doug, if that's what you want, then go. - Melissa, come on. - Good-bye, Doug. Hi, this is Doug. You know what to do when you hear the beep. Thanks. Doug, it's me. It's 1:00. Where are you? I'll be up for the next half hour. Please give me a call. I don't know what to tell you, Doug. I mean, if getting a little of this is the worst trouble in your life right now, I don't feel sorry for you. I'm being serious, man. - All right. - Ready? What about Laura? Nice. That's the whole thing. I know things... are a little shaky between you two. It's not even that. It's just Melissa is different. I don't know. I just don't know if I'm ready to give it up with Laura. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes right now, pal. Your pants... I'd like to be in your pants, but your shoes... You look like shit. What's the matter with you? I got a call last night from an old buddy of mine. Mitchell James. He's a top scout with the Giants. He's agreed to fly up here and take a look at you. When? Said he'd try to make one of the next three games. Now, he's coming up here to see you. This guy can tell a difference between somebody who's playing up to their potential and somebody who's just jerking around. Got it? All right. Keep it under your hat. Hey, Coach. Thanks. Hey- - Hey, Mitch. - Yeah. What are you gonna do when we graduate? Work for my old man. At the lumber yard? Yeah. Why? Nothing. I was just wondering. You coming or what? No. I'll see you tomorrow, man. Hello? Hi, slugger. How's it going? Listen, I'm sorry about last night. I haven't been feeling so great. My parents are fighting like crazy, and it's just starting to get to me. - Anyway, enough about that. - Melissa? I wanted to know, when would you like to get together again? How did you get my number? It wasn't that difficult. There is this thing called the phone book. Look, hold on a second. - Hello? - Doug? - I finally caught you. - Laura. Hi, baby. Where have you been? I've been trying to get a hold of you. Look, just hold on a second, okay? - Melissa? - Who's Melissa? Oh, just hold on. - Hello? - I don't like being put on hold. Look, fine. I'll call you back, okay? Do you still have my number? Yeah, I got it somewhere. - Laura. - Who's Melissa? She's just a friend of my mom's. - How is your mom? - She's okay. It's tough on her, though, you know? She talks about my dad like he's still around. So how is San Francisco? Wonderful. I take it your interview went well? It's official. I've been accepted. So how come you don't sound excited? I'm going to be in San Francisco. Yeah? Well, you may not be alone. What do you mean? There's a scout coming to see me... from the Giants. As in San Francisco Giants. When did this happen? Coach told me about it today. - Do you wanna get that? - No. I'd rather talk to you. Fuck you, you bastard! So, when are you coming home? I'm leaving first thing in the morning. I should get there around eight, depending on traffic. So, What, should I meet you at your place? I have a better idea. Oh, yeah? What's that? - The library. - The library? Isn't that what you wanted? No, that was different. I've been doing a lot of thinking, Doug. I mean, you were right. I don't know Why I make such a big deal out of it. I know I have to change. So the library it is. Is there a better place to learn? I'll meet you there. Bye. Laura? Yeah? I miss you. I miss you, too. - I'll be back soon. - Bye. - Hey, Doug. - Earl. - Doug. - Hey, Earl. Do you know what it took to get this part? Where'd you get it? Never ask a cop about his sources. You better take good care of that bike, just like your father did. I will. Thanks, Earl. Listen, tell your mom that... Marge and I will meet her at one for lunch. - 1:00. - Okay? - All right. - All right. - Thanks, Earl. - All right. Earl said he'd meet you at one for lunch. Oh, good. I do hope you're joining us. Actually, Mom, I can't. Doug, is there something Wrong? No. Nothing. Why? You just seem a little on edge lately. It's not like you. The coach said that a scout from the Giants is coming to see me. Oh, Dougie, that's terrific. Maybe you should shave this thing off. Ma, it's not that big a deal. You never know. We're talking professional. It's probably the Giants now. - Hello? - Is Doug there? Oh, hi, Laura. No, it's Melissa. Do I sound like Laura? I'm Doug's tutor. Oh, Melissa. Is he around? I'm sorry, Doug's not home right now. He's not? Do you know Where he went? No, I don't. He drove off about an hour ago. Really? Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Would you like to leave a message? No, that's okay. Melissa. Who's Melissa? It's nobody. It's just somebody I met at a party. So Why did I have to lie? I'm sorry, Mom. I just didn't feel like talking to her. Douglas? Yeah, Mom. Don't get yourself into trouble. Oh, shit. I don't believe this. Surprise, surprise. What are you doing here? I was about to ask you the same thing. Why did your mother lie to me? I told her to. Why? Because I said I would call you. But you didn't, so what's a girl to do? So, what do you want? Well, I made reservations for two at Carmichael's tonight. - I already have plans. - My treat. I can't. Not tonight. - When? - I don't know. Oh, I see. So I served my purpose, and now you're moving on. No, that's not it at all. Melissa. You've got to shave that thing. I missed you. I missed you, too. All I could think about... was us. What's Wrong? Nothing. What do you mean nothing? - Aren't I... - No, it's not you. It's just- I don't know. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. I'm trying, Doug. Really. I know. We will begin today's class by making a longitudinal incision along the abdominal cavity. You will remember from last week the proper surgical techniques of opening the body. - And we will go through lessons... - Why don't you have the honors, Doug? ...26 through 30 of the tutorial. - Follow along through steps 11... - Go for it, slugger. ...through 16, and you will realize that Makon's descriptions are reasonably close to reality. Are we ready? It's easy once you get the hang of it. Very good, Mr. Gordon. Now identify... this. Gall bladder. Gall bladder. Very good, Mr. Gordon. Now, tracing away from the liver, you... Strike two. Watch the ball, Rich! Take it easy, now! Don't rush yourself! Come on, Filipelli! - Strike three! - What? You're outta here! Okay, we'll take it. Keep it up, Rich. Son of a bitch has gotta be throwing 90. He is. I clocked him on radar. - No shit. - Come on, Gordon! Come on, Gordon. Let's go, now. Come on, Gordon. Ball. That's the Way to Watch it! Good eye! Three! Lucky pitcher. Unlucky batter. It happens. Get dressed. Judy's here. Maybe we'll all go out. Okay, I'll be a sec. Meet you at your truck? Don't worry. You played well. Last one, chief. Didn't mean to make you jump. Maybe you ought to switch to decaf or meditate or some fucking thing. Lose something? - Get out. - Don't worry. No one's gonna interrupt us. Not unless they're a locksmith. Look, Melissa, this has gotta stop. Doug, you almost finished in there? Judy and I want to get something to eat. Yeah, look I'll be there in a minute, okay? I'm just gonna take a quick shower. Go ahead. Doug, are you alone? Yeah, why? I have a better idea. What's that? Why don't I come in and help you dry off? Look, that sounds really good, but the coach pissed at me, and he's coming back in a minute to talk to me, okay? So just go ahead and I'll meet you there. Okay. Let's go. Finally. I like it when you play rough. Just get the fuck out of here. Doug, what's Wrong? Look, I just want to get something straight with you, okay? Melissa. Don't be embarrassed. It's a good idea to spice things up. Otherwise, love will never last. - There is no love. - How can you say that? - After everything... - I'm sorry you misunderstood. It's Laura, isn't it? Yes, but I told you right from the beginning, okay? What does she have that I don't? Look, I'm not gonna have this discussion with you. Well, I bet she doesn't have this. That's not real, is it? Now, what would be special about a fake tattoo? I can't believe you did that. Why? Because all we did was fuck. We didn't make love. We fucked. And it didn't mean a thing. What about me? Huh? What about the Way that I feel? Did you ever stop to consider that? Huh? What did you think, that I was just some slut plaything you can do what you want with and just throw me away afterwards? I'm sorry that you feel this way, but I suggest that you get on with your life. Sorry I'm late. - Judy's already gone? - Yeah. What happened? I had to talk to the coach. I'm sorry. Hey, you can't hit one out of the ballpark every time. Scout might have been there. Is that what's bothering you? Yeah, I mean, if I don't start hitting the ball soon, then what's gonna happen? I'm not gonna get drafted. You'll get a hit, slugger. You always do. Why did you call me that? What, slugger? Yeah, you never called me that before. So what? Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm just... I'm sorry. I'm just being stupid. Just a minute. Your hell's broken. Yes, I know. - You must be Melissa. - I am. And you must be Mrs. Gordon. It's nice to finally meet you. What can I do for you? I'd like to speak with Doug. It's after midnight. Oh, I'm sorry. Is it past his bedtime? Good night. I really do need to talk with him. Doug is asleep. You can talk to him in the morning. I want to throw the ball! Okay, put your glove back on. I'll stay here. You throw me the ball. Hi, Dougie! It went all the Way over there. That's Wonderful! Good for you! Okay. Here, Dougie. I got the bat, Mom. Okay, Watch this. Mom? - Keep a firm grip on the bat. - Mom, what are you doing up? You know, Doug, your father really looks like you. Or you look like him, I should say. What the fuck are you doing here? - What is wrong with you? - I had to see you. - How did you get in here? - I have a key. You have keys to my house? Well, in case of emergencies. Yeah? Well, this is no fucking emergency. - Well, I think it is. - Why is that? I have to talk to you. Not now. My mother's sleeping. Oh, she's not gonna wake up. Not the way she's popping those pills. You should really talk to her about her dosage. Now you're spying on my mother? Oh, now this must be Laura. My, she's stunning, isn't she? What the fuck do you want? I'm afraid. Afraid of what? I was thinking about what you said today, about how we didn't make love, we just fucked? And then I thought, hey, if he's got that kind of attitude, then maybe he might have given me something. You think that I gave you something? Why are you so sure that you didn't? Me. You're the one that's fucking around. - You are Way off. - Am I? Yes. The only other girl I've been with in the last three years is Laura. How do you know how many people she's been with? Laura hasn't been with anyone else. Oh, well, she probably thinks the same about you. You know something? This is bullshit. - Is it? - Yeah, I want you to leave. Let's go. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, God, this is embarrassing. I'm sorry. It's okay. Come on, now. Don't cry. Come here, kitty. Come on. Doug? No classes today? Let me guess, you're taking a four-day Weekend? Why is your shower running? Wait a minute. I was just going in there. By the way, your friend Melissa was here last night. Kind of pushy, isn't she? Who is she, Doug? Doug? - Douglas? - Jesus, Mom! - What happened to privacy? - I want to know what's going on! Doug, I hope you know what you're doing. Hello? Doug, get over here! It's the cat. - Somebody killed your cat! - What? I can't believe it! It's him! - Okay, listen. - What's going on? Look, calm down. All right, listen. I'm coming right now. Someone is trying to destroy my life. She must have been the one who did this. Every time I turn around, she's there. I can't get rid of her. Melissa? Judy tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen. You told me she was a friend of your mom's. You lied to me. Why is she doing this? I don't know. She's obsessed. There's something really fucking wrong with her. Did you sleep with her? Get out. - I'm sorry. - I said get out! Look, it didn't mean anything. You son of a bitch, get the fuck out! No! Stop it! Please, stop it! Where the fuck have you been? I mean, you're missing practices. You look like shit. What is it? Look, I don't want to talk about it. What, are you fucking kidding me? You don't want to talk about it? This is me. Since when do you keep me in the dark? I mean, there's something going on, obviously. What is it? You don't know shit, okay? - I don't want to talk about it. - I don't know shit? I know there's something going on. What is it, you and Laura serve your time? That's not funny. When you two lovebirds get through, We've got a game to play. Suit up. Somebody wants to see you. Mr. Mitchell James. Come on, Doug. Show them your stuff now. Come on, Dougie! Come on, Dougie! Don't push it, Doug. Come on, let's go, now. Slam it home, Dougie. Come on, Dougie. Come on, let's go, now. Come on, Dougie. Come on, slam it home, Dougie. Hammer it home, Dougie. He's just having a slump. Mitch, this is Doug Gordon. He's the kid I was telling you about. Your coach has been badgering me all year to come and Watch you hit the ball. Sorry about the disappointment. Every batter has a slump, Gordon. But your stats don't lie. But at the pros, We're just as concerned with a man's character. What else you interested in besides baseball? Kinesiology and sports medicine. I figured it would be good to have something to fall back on just in case baseball doesn't work out. That's some schedule you're keeping. Yeah, it keeps me busy. I like you, Gordon. You've got high standards. That's just the kind of winning attitude We're looking for. Great. I'll try my best. Yeah. That's him. That's the son of a bitch! - Douglas Gordon? - What? - You're under arrest. - For what? - You have the right to remain silent. - Hey, take your hands off me! Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. I didn't do anything. I didn't touch her! If you can't afford a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you. Sick bitch. This is bullshit. God, how many times do you want to hear this? I was in my room studying, I heard the television and I went into the living room. - And she was there? - And you gave her a key. I did not give her a key. She made her own key without my permission. And, of course, you had a problem with that. Hey, look, I did not fucking hit her! All right, fellas, I'll take it from here. Well, if you want to handle this piece of shit, that's fine with us. Let's go. I read your statement, Doug. What the hell's going on? She broke into my house and she drugged me. I never laid a hand on her. I swear to God. I don't know what the fuck she's up to. All they have is a restraining order on you. I'll have you out of here in less than an hour. But you have to keep the hell away from her. Stay away from her? She's the one that's following me. Okay, okay. Let's drop that. Doug, I didn't want to have to tell you this in here. There's been an accident. Your mother's in the hospital. Mom? What happened? Mom? She'll be fine. We just have to keep an eye on her for awhile. In her condition, we can't afford for her to try something like that again. Try what? She overdosed on Maluprim... high-grade sleeping pills. They were different from her own prescription. I have no idea how she got them. I do. I feel awful. Wish you'd said something. Marge and I have always tried to be there ever since your dad died. I know. Listen. She didn't do this to herself. I know who did it. So tell me. It's that woman, Melissa. Are you sure? Laura, you've never been one to back down from a fight. There's something wrong here. I don't think you can just blame Doug. Five minutes. Doctor Richard Nelson was acquitted today in Seattle. He faced charges of physical abuse against his 12-year-old daughter. Nelson's Wife Patricia declined to comment on the injuries.

Well, you're the first one, actually. Since her daughter brought her in here two Weeks ago, none of the folks around here can get a word out of her edgewise. I'll leave you two alone. Don't expect too much from her. If you want anything, I'll be in admin when you finish. Mrs. Nelson? Hi, I'm Laura Hutton. I need to speak to you about Melissa. My friend may be in danger. Mrs. Nelson, if there's anything that you could tell me that might help me understand your daughter... Did she do this to you? Melissa... Hi, Doug. It's me. I have to tell you something. It's about Melissa. Hello? Anybody home? Miss Nelson? Miss Nelson? Is anyone home? The door was open. Miss Nelson? Is anyone home? Earl? Earl? Earl? According to the report, Melissa had a history of abuse problems with her father. Looks like she settled the score on that. You go with him. He's gonna take you to the hospital, check you out. - I'll call you later, okay? - All right. Can I get you a ride home? No, it's okay. I got my truck. Why don't you get some rest? Someone will look after your mother, okay? Yeah, thanks. You son of a bitch. Get the fuck out! Hey! Over here! Hey! Over here! Melissa. Well, hello, you. Did we have a little accident? Looks like you could use some help. Melissa, don't fuck around! What's that I smell? Is that gasoline? Wouldn't it be romantic? Two lovers going up in flames. Melissa, please. Just help me get out of here, okay? Why? Do you want me to die here like this? You know, you do have a point. Having you die like this wouldn't be very... fun. You blew it, fucker. With her attempt on your life, Doug, we have hard evidence against her now. I have the Feds on our side and have contacted Interpol. They have traces on her credit cards, bank accounts, you name it. She makes a move, we'll know about it. And if you don't start taking care of yourself, I'll know about it. Marge said you went to work a week early. Don't you worry about anything. Doug, would you follow me out, please? You keep an eye on your mother, okay? - I will. - I know you will. - I'm just here to see your mother. - Can I talk to you? I have nothing to say. Look, I have something to say. Please. I fucked up. I fucked up like I never fucked up before in my life. I made a mistake, and I'm paying for it. But she set me up. She almost killed my mother and she almost killed me. Laura, you're the best thing that ever happened to me. And it kills me to think that I threw it away. I never meant to hurt you. I'm so sorry. I love you. Nice furniture. Yeah, it's my roommate, Lisa's. Hey, look. A VCR that actually has the correct time. No more blinking 12:00. What would I do without you? Thanks. Well, I guess I'll see you in a couple Weeks when I come back for try-outs. Well, I better hear from you before then. You will. You know, this is a big place. You sure you don't want me as a roommate? I just need some time. I got you. - Bye. - Bye. Yeah? Hold on. You Doug Gordon? Phone. Yeah, hello? How's try-outs, slugger? Melissa? You remembered my voice. How sweet. And after all this time. - Where are you? - Oh, come on. The last thing I need in my life is more cops. Who said anything about the cops? Well, then, Why are you so concerned about my whereabouts? - I want to see you. - You're lying. It's true. I can't stop thinking about it. The first night in the car? The boat. I close my eyes, and all I see is you. Melissa? I can't stop thinking about it, either. Are you in Washington? Why do you care? Because I want to be there... with you. They're looking for me. We'll have to be careful. I understand. Are you sure you want to do this? I do. - Okay, swear. - I swear. Now swear on Laura's life. Look, Melissa, do you want to be with me or not? Only if you swear on Laura's life. I swear. Say the whole thing. I want to be with you, Melissa. I swear on Laura's life. That's better. Now tell me where you are. No, I'll come for you. Hello? Yeah, hi. What's the matter? She's back. Well, did you call the police? Yeah, I did. Just be really careful, okay? I mean, lock your doors and shit. I think you're being just a little bit paranoid. I mean, she couldn't possibly have any idea Where I am. All right? Yeah, okay. So relax. Yeah, all right. I'm sorry. Oh, wait, hold on. I was just making some tea. Oh, here, my roommate wants to say hello. - Laura... - Doug, be nice! Just say hello. Hi, slugger. - Melissa... - Did I overhear correctly? You called the police? If you hurt her, I will fucking kill you! Oh, well, Doug, you swore on her life, so I guess the hall's in my court now. Doug said to say good-bye. Oh, I wanted to talk to him. He said to say good night. He has to go to bed early. Something about try-outs tomorrow. That sounded close. I hate thunderstorms. Ever since I was a child. Me, too. Oh, great. Oh, that's okay. I think there are some candles around here somewhere. Sounded nice. Huh? Doug. Yeah, he is. We're just trying to iron out a few things, but we really love each other. That's nice. Three years? God, I envy you. I was in love once, but his heart was in another place. So what is it that you're trying to work out? - I don't... - What did he do? Fuck some other girl? Excuse me? Did he put his cock somewhere he shouldn't have? I think I'm gonna go find a flashlight. Lisa? Lisa, open up! The door's stuck! You scared the shit out of me. Lisa? Why don't we talk about Doug's other girlfriend? I'm at the address right now. - Good evening, Miss. - Hello, officer. Can I help you? Yeah, I received a call about a disturbance. You did? Anyone else here besides yourself? No, just me. I'm all alone. There's nothing wrong except that I got a little scared. All the lights went out. Yeah, I know. The whole neighborhood's down. - Sure you're okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Well, just the same, maybe I should check the house. Sure, if you Want. I love old houses. Yeah, me, too. What's in here? Oh, that's my roommate's storage space. She has the keys. She went out to the movies tonight. Oh, yeah. Well, I'll be. Wife's got the exact same vase. Laura, you're awake. Good, 'cause We're gonna play a little game. You like games, Laura, don't you? Now, here's how we play. First, we make a list of all the Wonderful things that you have that I don't. And then... And then... we remove them... surgically. Now, Doug said something about you having a kind heart. Laura! Fuck you, you bastard! You think you can fuck me! You fucking bastard! How do you like it? Fuck you! God damn you! Where is she? I'm not fucking around with you! Where is she? Gonna shoot me now, Doug? I will fucking kill you. Where is she? You're a killer now, is that it? Well, you know, guns are pretty messy. You sure you can handle it? 'Cause it might be kind of hard without these. It's gonna be okay.
