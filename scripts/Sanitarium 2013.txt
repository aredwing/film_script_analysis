Pushing us to commit horrendous acts... that transcend the usual imagining sphere. Moves from one person to another... without distinction of sex, race, age or creed. Giving rise to unimaginable results... we are unable to accept nor understand. We can only attempt, perhaps in some way... contain these insane poor... helpless wandering through the narrow limits... of their inner worlds. My name is Dr. Henry Stenson. Welcome to the madhouse. Give it. Patient 49. came recently with a very tragic story... after losing everything that has ever loved. Art is a very subjective means. We see what we want to see... in a painting, a book, a sculpture or a figure. Come here, I can not and fix your hair. There. Tilt your head slightly to the left. That is. Float down the stairs.

The mind does everything necessary to protect... such terrible experiences. The mind is incredibly tough. can create worlds of fantasy... to protect us from reality and blind us to the truth. The worse the truth, the greater fantasy. On the other hand, fantasy can also be more real... than we could ever imagine . Most of his days were passed sat with rapt gaze... but sometimes, when you observe the clouds, can see him smile. - What is your name? - James.

The sounds were very clear last night. The din was repeated, but hardly open my eyes... sounds begin. I think I can be suffering from a neurological syndrome high pressure. Are you trying to fool? Who laughs now? The word designates a planet Nibiru . The Twelfth Planet. In the writings of Dr. Sitchin about Nibiru, Planet X... the Annunaki the existence of... is also mentioned . An alien race, according to him, created man... more than 300,000 years ago. Many researchers, including myself... believe that 2012 will mark the return of Annunaki. Wave time zero. At the end of time... the ebb and flow of novelty will be increased... attraction of the teleological end of the universe. Can also refer to this as the "black path". Possibly... Could this be the true wave zero time? The change in position of the zodiac... is causally associated with the astral location mapping. Basta. It's hard, I know. Sometimes these things pile into my head... and there are many who suddenly cease to make sense. Allison, I wish you were here . I just want to hear. James. James, please listen to me. Not want to know any of this. I just want my husband back. "And in that hour came a great earthquake ... and a tenth of the city was devastated... y were killed in the earthquake seven thousand people .. . and others were frightened and gave glory to the God of heaven. The second woe happened... more, behold, the third woe comes presto " I'm only I'm only I'm only We need one more.
