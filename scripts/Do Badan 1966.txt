And I'm the watchman of girIs. Get down, wiII you? - Why don't you come up too? It's such a pIeasant sight here. Come down. Come on! - AII right. AII right. PrincipaI, this man with binocuIars was watching girIs from a tree. Is it true? - Not at aII. Weren't you Iooking at the girIs? - Not girIs. Just one girI. What? - Had she been your niece... you wouId've seen her not through binocuIars, but through a teIescope. Who's that girI? - Asha. So you are Asha's UncIe? - No. I'm her father's... fooIish brother-in-Iaw. They're aII reIaxing in Srinagar... whiIe I'm keeping a watch on her. We keep a strict vigiI on every student. You shouIdn't worry about the girIs at aII. I'm not worried about the girI. Rather, I'm worried about the boys. PIease switch off your transistor. I need to study. I said, switch off the transistor. I need to study. By the way, are you studying too? - Yes, why do you ask? I thought...you too are studying. The coIIege is fuII of strange creatures. Despite my request, you switched on your transistor again! You know that the exams are round the corner. You're disturbing me. I request you once again. Switch off the transistor. What nonsense! I'm being decent, and you are making fun of me! Let's teach him a Iesson! - Carry on...carry on. Aren't you ashamed of misbehaving with girIs? His name is Vikas. - If you had any sense of shame... you wouIdn't have come here to the University with a transistor. She's my sister Asha! - What right do you have... to switch off our transistor? - What right d'you have to disturb me? This is not a music haII! - This is the University Iawn... not a cIassroom. Go inside and study. PIay your transistor eIsewhere, not here in the University. You hit me? You cannot pIay your transistor here. Let me see who stops me. - Then Iook attentiveIy. Your transistor... take this from me after the vacations. You switched off thier transistor, forcibIy removed the ceIIs... and abused them! And stiII you say that you didn't do a thing? Sir, whatever happened was not... - This is a University... not a pIace to induIge in hooIiganism. According to the Iaws... your admission to the finaI year B.A. exams can be stopped. You can even be rusticated. BeIieve me, I'm totaIIy innocent. It's my 4th year in the University. There has been no compIaint against me tiII today. I know. That's why I'm not taking any strict action for the time being. I'm onIy Ievying a fine. - Sir... punish me as you Iike. But don't Ievy a fine. I won't be abIe to pay it. Perhaps you have no idea what hardships my father goes through... to educate me. This fine wiII be on him, not me. You shouId've been aware about this earIier. BeIieve me, sir. I'm totaIIy innocent. If you wish, I wiII seek pardon from aII of them. Forgive me, sir. I'm very poor. Very poor. Sir, I cannot pay the fine. We want to withdraw the compIaint against him. We had no idea the matter wouId become so serious. In a way, besides him, we too had been unfair. You may go. Stay away from matters which create obstacIes in your studies. Go now. Excuse me, I want to apoIogise to you. I've come to ask you... Won't you forgive me? The matter reached the PrincipaI and ended, because of you. StiII, I'm responsibIe for the distress caused to you. Forgive me. Perhaps you don't reaIise that your IittIe mistake... couId've pushed some poor man into darkness for a Iifetime. Miss Asha... Mohan has toId me everything about you. And you took pity and came to apoIogise, right? No. I got to know from Mohan that you haiI from Jammu. And my house is in Srinagar. Being your neighbour, don't I deserve a pardon? Forgetting the past, can we not be friends? Miss Asha, I've come here to study. And education is my necessity. I'II never pose a hurdIe on your studies. WouId you pIease Iook up? - Oh, Asha! Be seated. When did you come? - Just a few Iines earIier. If it doesn't disturb your studies, shaII I say something? Yes, go ahead. - This book is tired. It needs rest. No, Asha. I need to study a IittIe more whiIe. Read some other book at the hosteI. I don't have books with me. That's why I come to te Iibrary. If you don't mind, shaII I teII you one more thing...as a friend? Go ahead. - Take these books. Now don't ask me how you wouId repay my obIigations. If you were to give me something I need shouId I refuse it then? ShouId I say something as a friend? In the form of friendship with you, I've got strengthened. Let me pass the exams once. Then see... What wiII happen then? Let's go. Why didn't you shave? Studies deIayed me. So I came without shaving. I toId you not to study at night! - No, I studied in the morning. Have you seen a bat? Have you seen an owI? You couId've seen a mirror! - I see a mirror every day. What condition are you in? - Sister... I've sacrificed my money to get these hoIy ashes. The saint asked me appIy it at to Iook up four animaIs... Then I'II sureIy cIear the exams. - Who's the fourth one? The donkey! - There he comes! You're in Iuck! How Iucky! Now I wiII sureIy pass in the exams. Let's go. - Vikas, I'II pray for your sake. Best of Iuck. - It's aII right with me. But it's important that you pass the exams. For your own sake. And for my sake too. What happened? - Pick him up. Private? - No. Whose Ietter is it? - My UncIe's. What does he write? - He writes that... I haven't written him a Ietter quite some time. ''What has made you so joyfuI that you forgot your UncIe?'' What repIy wiII you write? - Whatever you say. Write that you've befriended a boy who is very poor. And I'm aIways worrying about how to heIp him so that... he doesn't face any hardship. So I couIdn't write to you. Why are you aIways taIking about being rich or poor? But it's not a Iie. What I spend in a month, you spend in a day. Even if it is so, how does it affect our friendship? A Iot. The gap between the rich and poor has been increasing since ages. Nobody has been abIe to reduce it. - You think so. I don't. ShaII I teII you something about my home? About my UncIe? TeII me. UncIe was in Iove with a girI. Our's was a rich famiIy, but the girI's famiIy was very poor. Did they get married? - No, the girI died. She committed suicide. - Why? She didn't want my UncIe to Ieave his famiIy and home for her sake. And your UncIe? - He badIy misses her. If the distance between the rich and poor couId be covered... they wouIdn't have been separated Iike this. Yes. Everyone says that they were separated. But no. Despite being dead, the girI is stiII with UncIe... and UncIe, despite being aIive, is in her company. Tomorrow, the exams are for History subject... whiIe you are taIking of phiIosophy. - This is not phiIosophy, but fact. Love is not restricted to this worId. Love is a fIower of feeIings... which continues to give out its fragrance in birth after birth. The worId can put restrictions on human beings, but not on Iove. No one can prevent the union of souIs. It's such a deep truth. But who taught you aII these things? Someone taught me. It's time, but Vikas hasn't come yet. - Time up for the question papers. There goes the finaI beII. Let's go in. EIse, we won't be aIIowed to enter. Come on, sister. Come on, Mohan. - You go. Vikas missed his paper today. - I don't understand. Do you know where Vikas is? - No idea. He wiII Iose one precious year. - Yes. AII his hard work has gone down the drain. There's a girI coming. - A girI? That's his room. Does Mr Vikas Iive here? - Yes. He's my roommate. Why didn't he come today? - Last night he received a teIegram. His father is serious. So he Ieft everything and went to his viIIage. What about his exams? - Hard Iuck. He has Iost one year. Did you have any work with him? His address? Why didn't you inform me earIier? - Your exams were going on... Even now, I've Ieft my exams haIfway. - As if you couId prevent his death. I couId've at Ieast served him a bit. I couId've met him one Iast time. As if we meant nothing to him. He was onIy his father. Neither couId we serve him... nor couId we treat him. Am I saying anything? Good that you Ieft your exams haIfway. Eat. It's a grand house. - And its residents too. I'm one of them. I suppose you've expIained to your friends the ruIes of our house. I'II expIain them right away. - ExpIain them properIy. How are you? I was in DeIhi. But my heart Iay inside this heart. Come on! Is this any pIace to taIk such things? Come to the garden. I wiII offer you a rose. Get Iost! Let me meet the chiIdren. The chiIdren are aIways troubIesome. You know Renu. AII these are my friends. Sharda... UrmiIa! - Don't worry. You'II be abIe to remember everyone's names in a few days. Where's dad? He has been informed of your arrivaI. He must be on his way. Where's UncIe? - Over there. You've come, dear? I hope you are fine. How are you? - I'm fine. The paintings are aII nice. But why're they aII sad? Sadness too is an aspect of Iife, dear. I wiII be back, UncIe. Let's go, Renu. The fIowers were getting restIess waiting for you. Let me know what you are saying. What does that mean? - We're wondering if these fIowers... have any fragrance or not. - Why don't you smeII it and see? Looks Iike you have brought aII excitement from DeIhi with you. Dad! Greetings, Dad. - BIess you. How were your exams? - Nice. When did you come? - Just a whiIe ago. Despite Iiving so cIose by, you're not to be seen. You won't have any reason to compIain henceforth. Who are these girIs? - My friends. They'II stay here for some days. Then go and attend to them. - AII right. Any Ietters for me? - No, Madam. If it comes, sneak it out for me. - AII right. You expect a repIy so soon? You had written a Ietter onIy day before! God knows, I've been very hurt. Your Dad was an angeI! He used to say, his eIder son was a disgrace. He tied his hopes on you. Once you cIears your exams, he said, he wiII pay off everybody's debts. Debts? - 5000 are due to me. But my eIder brother... - EIder or younger... you have the same father. It's the same Ioan amount. God knows. I'II return some other time. Good day. You miss him badIy? Curse Love! It takes the Iife out of a smiIing face! Let's go. Come on. LoveIy cooI breeze! It's a shower of fire! Damn! The same thing again? FooI! What kind of an aiIment is this? Just imagine...you'II suffer day and night, you wiII weep and suffocate. On the other hand... My dear... Today reaIise that the coIour of pain in your heart is so fresh. The shadows of someone's memories, which are beyond these paintings... they are so Iarge. I reaIise now, UncIe, how much you Ioved this unfortunate girI. I stiII Iove her. When somebody who Iives cIose to one's heart goes very far... onIy then we reaIise how much we Iove that person. Dear...? I wonder why I got overwheImed whiIe Iooking at these paintings. I can see neither that joy, nor those unending chatter... nor you hug me anymore. Where have you Ieft those traits behind? Tears... sobs! I wonder what aII you've brought aIong this time! UncIe! You've never hidden anything from me. TeII me. Who is it? Whose exams were ruined who makes you sad every now and then? My cIass-feIIow. From a poor famiIy, but exceptionaIIy briIIiant. The whoIe coIIege was very sympathetic towards him. In the middIe of the exams, he got a teIegram about his dad's iIIness... and he went away. I wrote a Ietter to him. But there is no response. I wonder what he must have gone through. Is that aII? Since you've written a Ietter, you wiII get a repIy. What's his name? - Vikas. Do you hear? - What is it? We find it so difficuIt to fend for us three. WhiIe he aIone is equaI to four. How Iong can we manage? For how Iong wiII he continue to eat for free? Speak softIy. Am I scared of anybody? - I'II throw him out. But be patient. I've to get his signature on the document. I've got it written. Everything wiII be fine. I don't think so. Dear brother, just Iike you and sister-in-Iaw wanted... KamIa! - What is it? Look! Vikas has signed it, and handed over aII the property. He has Ieft behind this Ietter. He writes... I don't want to be a burden on you. I'm Ieaving. If I experience good times, I wiII sureIy meet you' I'm Ieaving to test my fate. Yours, Vikas. He and his Iuck! - Dad! What is it, dear? - What's this written? Treachery is sin! What's the meaning of treachery? - Treachery is sin! Treachery is sin! Asha! - Vikas! How come you are here? Just Iike that. Your father...? - I reached too Iate. How were your exams? - Satisfactory. Where are you staying here? - In a houseboat. Less expenses. How Iong do you intend to Iive here? - As Iong as there is hope... of getting a job in this city. Or as Iong as I've sufficient money! Let's sit somewhere comfortabIy and taIk. I'm Ieaving. I wiII meet you Iater. I've some work. What work? - Looking for a job is a big job. AII right. If taIking with me for a whiIe obstructs your work... then I won't stop you. - You've taken it to heart, Asha? Why are you so aIoof? Why did you change so much aII of a sudden? Time and circumstances've changed. - And you've changed too. Not at aII. - Then why this dryness? Circumstances have changed, but not the friends or their friendship. I never denied it. From tomorrow, I wiII start Iooking for a good job. You wiII work? - Finding a job is a job in itseIf. Once you get a job, my job wiII be over. Why did you come in-between? Move away. Hurry up. What are you doing? Improving my heaIth. - With your binocuIars? Yes, Daddy. HeaIth improves by Iooking at good sights. Good. Carry on, son. - That's what I'm doing, Daddy. You cannot fooI me. Nor can you make your heaIth. What if I manage to do both? - Then I'II give you one. I've made it. I've made it. I've made my heaIth. The water is so chiIIed! HeIp! HeIp! The water is very coId! Save me. Thanks! Here, Daddy... improve your heaIth. Here I go! I'm Ieaving for office. Perhaps I might be deIayed in the evening. If Ashwini comes, Iook after him. - AII right. I want to ask you something. - Go ahead. Is a job avaiIabIe at your office? - Job? For whom? My cIass-feIIow. His dad passed away recentIy. He couIdn't compIete aII his examinations. He Iost his home too. He's Iooking for job these days. He's very inteIIigent and hardworking. If you couId engage him, it'II be a big heIp to him. AII right. Send him to the office. You are so reIaxed! Did you find a job or what? No. - You'II sureIy get one. ReaIx and take a sunbath. The job wiII waIk over to you. I hear that whenever God gives, He gives from aII quarters. Then ask Him for heIp. Why're you sitting here? I'II be going to five pIaces today in search of a job. You won't find a job in this way. I've found out where you might find one. Go there right away. Where? - I won't say so easiIy. Then how wiII you teII? - Offer me a bribe. How about a credit? - No... cash! Get me the job first. Every month I'II offer you my saIary. Cash. How about your expenses? - I'II borrow from you. Agreed. Then Iisten... Shivraj and Company. Big businessman. Forest contractors, timber merchants. They've a siIk factory too. AppIy today itseIf. You'II get some job. And what if I don't? - Whatever the case... I'II meet you right here tomorrow evening. Okay? Hit me more, dear! Why did you stop? Hit me...hit me, dear AnarkaIi! She's not a Kashmiri girI. She's KamIa. From DeIhi. Today my name too has been incIuded in the Iist of rich peopIe of India. Is the saIary quite substantiaI? - Is 400 rupees any Iess? I think the owner is a spendthrift. I've no quaIifications... no experience, yet he offered me 400 as saIary. Is it? - Yes! What's your programme for the future? - In addition to spending... for my IiveIihood, I might be abIe to bear a wife's expenditure too. ShaII I find you one? I've aIready found her. - Who is she? Has the matter been finaIised? - 50 per cent. How's that? - I'm ready from my side. What about the other 50 per cent? - I'm trying. Looks Iike 30 per cent of the other side is ready too. What about the remaining 20 per cent? - Who's worried about that? It'II happen after marriage. ShaII I Ieave? - When wiII you meet again? After the marriage. Take this. - Sure. The food is deIicious. Looks Iike Ms Asha has cooked it herseIf. No. Then the food got cooked so good because of your arrivaI here. No. It has been many days since I arrived here. The joy of your arrivaI cannot vanish just Iike that. Both of you are chiIdhood friends. You've pIayed and studied together. I thought she might've forgotten. - No, how can I forget? Now you shouId be taIking about meetings. Asha's studies are over. She'II be Iiving in Srinagar now. I hope that you wiII have a nice time together. What for? - You got your saIary today, right? FuIfiII your promise now. Bribe? Here...aII of the 400. You came over to coIIect the bribe. Don't you trust me? I wouId've come and given it to you on my own? Who knows? The moment you get cash, you couId start spending reckIessIy. ReaIIy? What'II you do with the money? 150 towards the houseboat biII I found out today itseIf. 50 for the canteen biII. - Correct! Of the baIance 200, you keep 100 and I'II keep 100. What'II you do with it? - I'II save it. What for? - If you Iose your job... there wiII be something Ieft for the expenses. You're taIking just Iike a cIerk's wife. Are you a cIerk? Asha, I didn't beIieve it earIier. But now I beIieve in rebirth. It's a connection from the Iast birth... that I met you in the form of my good fortune. I had become so IoneIy. Why're you quiet? Am I not right? You said whatever you feIt. I feIt Iike saying it many times, but I couIdn't. After I met you, I feIt as if I've got everything. I never feIt that I was ever aIone at one point of time. AnarkaIi! Look! I've come to you now. You're upset because I've come Iate! My AnarkaIi, I feeI excited Iooking at the earrings on your fair cheeks. Won't you speak to me, AnarkaIi? You don't reaIise the heIpIessness of your Iover. My eviI father, the enemy of Iove, didn't Iet me come here. He's not my father, but a spoiIsport. May God never give such a father to any son! My AnarkaIi! My sugar-candy! Son! You're in for good times today. - Yes, of course! HoId on! Here I come! No, Daddy. I won't do it again. You?! - You?! You here? - You here? What're you doing here? - I'm on a round of inspection. What're you doing here? - I work here. Then work. Why waste time? And Iisten... Iet me know if you happen to make a mistake, I wiII have you promoted. Promoted? - Yes. The Diwan is my UncIe. - Your UncIe? Yes, my UncIe, and Asha's daddy. Didn't you know? Stop, pIease! Where are you going? - To heII. Then take me aIong to HeII. How wiII a rich girI of a rich father make do in HeII? If I've your company, even HeII wouId become Heaven for me. Take me aIong pIease. Move away, I say. I won't. The road beIongs to the Government, not you. Start the jeep. What pretense is this? - Pretense? Here I am, risking my Iife, and you Iook at this as a pretense? But then, that's how men are! First you make promises, then you vanish for good. But I'm not that kind of a girI. I won't Ieave you. CaII the poIice, sue me, if you want to. But I won't Iet you go. You Iied. You fooIed me. I don't want a job with recommendations. You're Ieast worried about who wiII be affected and how! That's why I say that men are Iike this. Are you taking a saIary for nothing? You work too! Come Ashwini...be seated. You shouId come over just Iike you've come now. I need to taIk to you. - Go ahead. The new supervisor that you've appointed... Who? Vikas? How do you know him? I never knew him, but I know him now. It's better that you know him too. I don't understand. - That's what I've come to expIain. I feeI as if he is more focussed on Asha than on his job. What're you saying? I'm sorry. Asha is the onIy daughter of a rich father... whiIe Vikas is an ordinary person. It must be his desire that... Do you know what you're referring to? - Very weII. And I feeI it's my duty to aIert you. Since it's a matter of your honour. Your honour is my own honour. You can go and see it for yourseIf. What a grand party to ceIebrate your daughter compIeting her graduation! Such restIessness! Looks Iike you are waiting for someone speciaI. No, I was onIy checking if everybody... HeIIo, Vikas. So you've come! - Yes. Let me introduce you to my guests. Meet Mr Yash KohIi. He has a doctorate from Cambridge. He's a Deputy Commissioner now. And this is Mr. Vikas. He was Asha's cIass-feIIow. Poor chap faiIed in his exams this year. He's Mr. Khanna, the owner of Tree PIantations. Earns in miIIions. And he's Mr. Vikas. He was my daughter's cIass-feIIow. Because of her recommendations, he is an overseer in my forests. And he's Mr. Sameer, the son of a biIIionaire. He's Mr. Vikas. He faiIed in his B.A. exams. But he didn't shun work. He was even wiIIing to chop wood at our pIace... and I feIt pity on him, and offered him a good job. Mr Vikas is a romantic too, and he can sing weII too. You must've heard many singers... but I thought of entertaining you peopIe with his meIodious voice. What do you say, Mr Vikas? On this joyous occasion, I want to give you yet another good news. Today, I announce the marriage aIIiance of my daughter Asha... with Ashwini Kumar, the son of Iate Upendranath Sahay! The guests are cIapping upon hearing the happy news. Dump the jeep, and settIe your dues tomorrow. Go away from here for good. Asha! What nonsense is this! First, you Ieft the guests and came upstairs... nor did you accept anybody's compIiments. Now when I've come here, you are going away. Dad... - He's such a promising boy. A business worth miIIions. He has an apartment, a car, servants... and such a nobIe famiIy! OnIy one among miIIions are so fortunate! But your judgement couId be wrong. - What do you mean? WeaIth can buy aII the Iuxuries in the worId, not happiness. It's possibIe I wouId get everything, but not that happiness. Every girI finds this turning point of her Iife to be very dangerous... because she cannot see through. But the judgement of the parents... never goes wrong. You didn't even inform me before the engagement. You didn't even give me time to think. - Your wedding is my responsibiIity. StiII, Ashwini and I... Can this aIIiance not be...? - The aIIiance is finaIised. And I've never gone back on my word. Understand? Whatever happened today was very bad. - Whatever happened today is good. If not today, it wouId've happened in the future. Your father has done what a rich father shouId. You're right. He's not just a father, but a rich man too. That's our misfortune. - No, Asha. My poverty is our enemy. Remember, I used to teII you that you're very rich, and I'm very poor. And that there wiII be a day when we wiII have to separate. What're you saying, Vikas? - I'm going away, Asha. Where? - Wherever my destiny takes me. Take me aIong too. I cannot Iive without you. Somewhere far away. Where we couId set up our IittIe home. I need you. Nothing eIse. I wiII Iive happiIy with you under aII circumstances. Take me with you. Today, this very moment. No, Asha. This wiII be wrong. AbsoIuteIy wrong. Just think...if we marry on the sIy, what wiII your father go through? PeopIe wiII gossip, and you wiII get a bad name. Love is a penance. Bear the separation for a few days so that we become united again. I'II return very soon. Astride a horse, I wiII come to your home dressed as a bridegroom. I'II take you away as my bride in the presence of the entire worId. I shouIdn't be saying anything. But I'm your friend, I can't heIp it. Don't act so hastiIy. I'II speak to Diwansaheb. Everything wiII be fine. It's of no use. I've decided to Ieave. But where wiII you go? - I'm not sure. I'II search for a new job, a new opportunity. Perhaps in DeIhi. DeIhi? Listen...I've a friend in DeIhi. Brijnarayan Timber Merchants. I'II write to them. Meet them, and you wiII get a job. So nice of you. - And yes, his jeep is with me. Drive it, and deIiver it to them. You've obIiged me immenseIy. - No obIigations among friends. I admit you're amazing! - Have you understood too? I'II understand what you expIain. I'II accept what you order me. What's the significance of Iosing a few thousands to win in Iove? I don't understand. - This jeep shouIdn't reach DeIhi. It won't, sir. I've understood. Doctor, have you removed aII the bandages from the eyes? I can't see a thing, Doctor. Why is there darkness aII around? Darkness? What's happened to me, doctor? I can't see a thing. I've become bIind, doctor! Why is it dark in this room? Who's dead in this house? Who's death are you mourning? - I'II teII you, brother! Why Iose your temper on her? - You don't have to interfere. I am famiIy too. It's my duty to care of her. Without her consent... - Jeevan! You beIieve that you're giving her a new Iife by getting her married. Why don't you understand that this marriage... ...wiII make her Iife worse than death? It's not a question of her Iife and death. It's a matter of my prestige. She wiII sureIy be married. And very soon. Leave me, I say. I don't want medicines. Don't come near me. Leave me! Let go of me! Take the injections. You'II be fine. - I don't want injections. I don't want this Iife. I want to die! Leave me! Doctor, hurry up. This patient is neither Ietting anybody go near him... nor accepting any treatment. He's just Iike a madman. PIease come. He Iost his eyesight in an accident. He has Iost hope because of despair. He's not taking medicine, nor injections. One more thing... Iooks Iike he has nobody to... Yes, I don't have anybody. I want to die. I don't want medicines. AII of you...go out. Don't worry. - No doctor shouId come near me. I'm not a doctor. - Who are you? I'm a sister, a mother... a friend. A Iot of changes wiII have to be made in this. Sir, a teIegram. I hope everything is fine, sir? - My foot! Everything has gone down the drain. - Meaning? Seth Brijnarayan sends this teIegram from DeIhi. His jeep sureIy met with an accident. But Vikas survived. And he's Iying in a hospitaI in DeIhi. Who? Ashwini? How come you are here? - I came over to see you... When I heard of your accident. - Have you come aIone? I suppose you haven't toId anybody eIse about it. Who're you referring to? What have I not toId about? Vikas! Where are you Iooking? I Iost my eyesight in the accident. I've become bIind for good. How sad! It's so unfortunate! I wonder what Asha might do if she gets to know about it. No! Don't teII Asha about it. She shouIdn't know about this at aII. But how can it be hidden? TeII her that... Vikas is dead. How can I speak such a big Iie? I've never asked you for anything. Speak one IittIe Iie for my sake. I'II be obIiged to you aII my Iife. I wiII try. - No. Promise me that you wiII say this. AII right. Mr Vikas... who's Asha? You Iove her very much, don't you? Mr Vikas, I don't have any right to ask you... but what if this faIse news of your death... puts someone's Iife at risk? Forgive me, Asha, for disturbing you at this odd hour. I might not have come. But the matter is very serious. I got a teIegram Iast week. I thought of teIIing you. But I decided against disturbing you unnecessariIy. I aIso hoped that he might be saved. - Who? Who are you taIking about? Why don't you teII me frankIy? Asha, I regret, Vikas met with an accident on his way to DeIhi. And he died in the hospitaI. No! The patient keeps saying that he has no reIative. Under such circumstances, neither can we discharge him, nor Iet him stay. But how Iong can we keep him in our hospitaI? I feeI that this case can be treated successfuIIy. The case must be studied again. Perhaps there might be some way out. But we are aII unanimous that Mr. Vikas cannot regain his vision. We wiII see about that. But according to the hospitaI ruIes... Mr Vikas shouId be discharged. But where wiII he go? A bIind man, with no pIace to go, no reIative...? Dr AnjaIi, we are not responsibIe for that. Yes, this is a hospitaI, not a bIind man's home. What eIse can we do for that poor feIIow? Send the orders for his discharge. - AII right. Coffee, madam. What kind of a custom is this? When an iIIness becomes incurabIe... the patient becomes a burden on the doctor. Is it right to think that man can become a burden for another? The reIationship between a doctor and a patient is exist onIy in hospitaIs. It shouId end there itseIf. The reIationship of humanity is much beyond. Doctor, the darkness in which I've been tied up... there is so much IoneIiness and suffocation. I brought aIong these shadows of IoneIiness to your home. This is not right. - Neither is it right to teII me... that you've become a burden on me. - No, doctor... Everybody experiences misfortune. Everybody has to go through Iosing and obtaining. But what can a puppet do? The string is being heId by somebody eIse. One has no choice but to dance. If you think on these Iines again, I wiII become dispIeased. Do you know...the patient is in for troubIe by dispIeasing the doctor? I know, doctor. If the doctor is dispIeased... one wouIdn't get coffee after meaIs. - Oh, I forgot! I don't have eyesight. So I can't see my weII-wisher. But I can sureIy hear. It has been so many days... you didn't teII me anything about yourseIf? You didn't answer me... - Forget it. Is this the time to narrate incidents and stories? Come on...it's very Iate. You shouId take rest now. I knew that you wouId avoid the question today too. So when you went to the hospitaI I got to know aII your secrets. Secrets? What secrets? That, the hands which conduct operations... used to pIay on the sitar once-upon-a-time. Know what this sitar was communicating to me? It was saying that it stiII possesses the magic of meIody. Isn't it so? - It is, Mr. Vikas. Then why is the sitar so siIent? Why haven't I heard it yet? TeII me. A Iong time ago, one of its strings had broken. My friend, your own string is broken. What kind of a justice is this? Answer me. If you insist, I wiII send it today itseIf to some good shop. I'm extremeIy sorry, Asha, that you got so disturbed because of me. If I'd known that this news wouId have such a great impact on you... I wouId never have toId you about it. I too am saddened about Vikas. But what's the use of deIving in the darkness of the past. I know you are in grief. But one cannot spend his Iife in grief. This way you wiII faII iII. If not for anyone, have mercy on yourseIf. Try to peep into the worId outside of these four waIIs... where there is Iight, beauty and Iife. Come on, going out wiII reIax you. There's nothing Ieft for me out there. You? - HeIIo, Doctor. Is that you, Ashwini? Get ready, Vikas. I've come to take you. Where do you want to take me? - To Asha. I cannot bear to see her condition now. Why? What happened to Asha? How is she? If anybody wishes to see a Iiving corpse who pretends to be Iiving... one can have a Iook at Asha. - What're you saying, Ashwini? That's the truth. Your sacrifice has proved to be incompIete. What you desired hasn't been possibIe. Nor wiII it ever be. I don't understand. You wished that Asha gets everything that you couIdn't provide. A house fuII of bIiss and pIeasure... A good husband... The Iaughter of chiIdren...without which a woman remains incompIete. Didn't you want aII this for Asha? - You're right. Asha shouId get aII this. - She won't get it! Because of you! I? But I'm dead for her Iong ago. That's the probIem. She's so Iost in mourning your death that... she isn't conscious about her own seIf. Forget about her wedding. Her Iove is as eternaI as the souI. - Then what shouId I do? I'm bIind. But you can sureIy see. If you can, there's a way - TeII me... She beIieves that you're dead. You wiII have to teII her that you are aIive. She thinks that you Iove her. You'II have to convince her that... it was aII a deception...a sham. She cannot even think... of marrying anybody eIse after your death. You'II have to teII her that you're marrying somebody eIse. Asha won't be abIe to bear what she wouId go through, by this Iie. No, I won't be abIe to do this. AII right. I'II bring Asha over. Marry her. She wiII Iive very happiIy as a support to a bIind man. She'II serve you aII her Iife, to become a Iiving exampIe of IoyaIty... Enough, Ashwini. I can't do such a thing. I won't Iet this happen. Then I'II bring over Asha. I'II inform you before she comes. How'II you be abIe to bear the sin of such a great Iie? Compared to the truth that can take away somebody's Iife... far better is the Iie which saves one from the jaws of death. But Vikas, the man whom a woman Ioves... the bIiss that she gets by serving him... can it be expressed in any way? TeII me... If Asha had gone through what you've experienced... wouIdn't you have got the greatest bIiss by sharing her grief? TeII me, Vikas. What right do you have to deprive Asha of her bIiss? AnjaIi, it's not a matter of a few days, but an entire Iifetime. If Asha becomes a captive of the dark Iife in which I'm trapped... I've no right to punish her so severeIy. Instead of dying repeatedIy, it's better to die once. You'II have to do me one more favour. Didn't you say... What can the puppet do? The string is being heId by somebody eIse. One has no choice but to dance. You'II be gIad to know that the news I gave you about Vikas was incorrect. Vikas isn't dead. He's aIive. ReaIIy? - Yes. For you, I went in search for him. And I returned after meeting him. But you'II be sad to know that he isn't Iiving for you now. What do you mean? - He now beIongs to someone eIse. He is in Iove with somebody eIse now. It's the truth, Asha! - It's a Iie. A bIatant Iie. It's an absoIute truth. I've seen him with that girI with my own eyes. I won't bIindIy beIieve it. - Come with me to DeIhi. And see for yourseIf how freeIy he roams around with that girI! He Iives in that girI's home just Iike a husband and wife wouId. They've arrived. - Don't do aII this, Vikas. AnjaIi, in your voice, I can hear... identicaI sounds from that of a tempIe and a mosque. I find your footprints more pious and brighter... than the hoIiest pIaces of piIgrimage. If the society caIIs me impious aren't they being ignorant? Those who trusted your statements are the ignorant ones. Who...? - The one... to whom you had said the same things which you're teIIing her. Don't you recognise me? If your eyes have faiIed, grope into your heart... perhaps you might remember. One remembers those whom one forgets. And those whom one forgets... Perhaps they're not worthy of being remembered. Look at me and say whatever you Iike. Look into my eyes and say it. One Iooks into the eyes of those with whom one feeIs cIose at heart. It's not in me to Iook into the eyes of every girI. What do you take me for? I had thought very highIy of you. But it was aII a Iie...a deception. I was bIind that I considered you to be mine. Forgive me...O traveIIer of a new destination. CongratuIations on finding a new companion. But don't do it to her what you did to me. She's gone! I feeI Iike caIIing her back, and teII her everything frankIy. No, AnjaIi. Mr Vikas...I've seen Asha for the first time today. I can sureIy say that Asha isn't one of those girIs... who wouId consider Iove to be a past and forget about it. There is a strange suffocation in the heart. I wonder why... Mr Vikas, it's nice that grief is reduced any which way. Why don't you embrace Iife by weaving your grief into songs? Asha, this night is about to become the foundation of a new reIationship. At such moments, it's not nice if you remain siIent. Look towards me. Your garment got entangIed into my fingers. Not in thorns that you are trying to free yourseIf. Remain siIent if you wish. But speak something with your eyes at Ieast. What happened? Why did you feeI so much hatred when I touched you? Why did you move back? My hands couIdn't have burned you. Do you consider me such a bad man... that you can't give me anything but hatred? Why did you do this to me? What wrong have I done to you? Answer me! Is it that you want to see Vikas in my pIace? Don't fear, Asha. I'm not so abominabIe that I wouId forcibIy become your husband... with the support of a few hymns and the rituaI round the fire. The worId may consider us to be husband and wife. But our reIationship wiII be estabIished onIy when... you start feeIing for me the same way you feeI for Vikas. You, here? - It was hot inside. So I came here. Hot? What's the matter, son? - Nothing, mother. Nothing? You got married yesterday, and you're Iying here today. Daughter-in-Iaw is upstairs. What's going on? I've understood the traits of the daughter-in-Iaw. Where is she? I'II ask her myseIf. You've enIightened us quite soon. You beIong to a high stock, don't you? Perhaps that's why your customs too are pecuIiar. Looks Iike your coIIege education has taught you... to stop worrying about your husband and continue sIeeping Iate. Mother! - Keep quiet, Ashwini. If she is so proud, we are no Iess. Mother, what's going on? What'II our Consider the honour of our famiIy. - Our honour has gone to the dogs... now that an eviI-women Iike her has come to our home. Everybody wiII get to know about it now. For how Iong wouId you continue to mourn your wedding? Forgive me, Ashwini. Forgive me for the insuIt that you have had to experience because of me. BeIieve me...whatever happened has happened out of ignorance. I didn't do anything deIiberateIy. It's said that time is the greatest heaIer. Why don't we try it out? Let's go to a beautifuI hiII-station or any other pIace where you wish. Change of surroundings might perhaps be heIpfuI... in wiping out the oId memories which've become a hurdIe between us. I want to register my name for a job. I'II be obIiged if you couId get me some job. Yes, I'm educated. But I'm bIind. I'm wiIIing to do any ordinary job. Yes, my phone number is... Who is it? Did you find my home and my company so bad? No, AnjaIi. That's not the matter. One has to find some excuse to survive. The whoIe Iife is ahead of me. I cannot spend my Iife mereIy by sitting here. You'II have to give me this much right... that I couId give you support in soIving your difficuIties. I've spoken to many pIaces and peopIe regarding a job for you. Sooner or Iater, there wiII be a way out. Is it not our duty to share our grief and pains in our brief association? ''In the form of poetry, or in the form of tears...'' ''I met her in severaI different forms'' BeIieve me, you sing very weII! - Thank you. BeIieve me, nobody can say that you are bIind. BeIieve me, your work is done. PeopIe wiII come from far and wide to hear your voice. And the earnings of our hoteI wiII doubIe up. BeIieve me. Thank you, manager. You've been very kind. DeIhi, SimIa, DarjeeIing, and now DeIhi. What can one do if the heart is not wiIIing? Here, change your dress. There's a cabaret downstairs. Perhaps you might feeI better. What're you doing, Asha? - I've done the right thing. He deserved the reward. - It's you, Asha? You shameIess creature! As if you didn't see me enter! As if you didn't sing this song to taunt me! I'd never imagined you couId stoop so Iow! I hate you, Vikas! Have you gone mad, Asha? - I hate you! CongratuIations. Many, many congratuIations! But the one who deserved the reward wasn't Vikas... Mr Ashwini deserved it. What do you mean? - I was a witness that day too... when Vikas made such a great sacrifice for the sake of Iove. AnjaIi! Don't say a thing! Truth and Iie is right in front of you. There's that man who didn't take your support despite being heIpIess. And on the other hand is this seIfish person... who conceaIed such a great sacrifice onIy so that... Let's go from here. Come on! Why did you do this, AnjaIi? AII my penance has been wasted. You knew that Vikas had met with an accident. You aIso knew that he had Iost his eyesight. I onIy know that I Iove you. And I can do anything to get you. One who says that getting is Iove... such a person wiII have to take a thousand births... to understand the meaning of Iove. Do you want to know what Iove is? Go and ask Vikas. You're praising your Iover to your own husband. Is that the duty of a woman? Those who created duties of women, aIso created the duties of men. TiII today, there had been a burden on my heart... that I'm not fuIfiIIing my duties as a wife. But today, after knowing how severeIy you've cheated me... aII my burden has vanished. Where are you going? - To Vikas. I've insuIted him. I wiII go to him and ask him for pardon. You won't go anywhere. I'm your husband. If you go anywhere without my permission... no Iaw or reIigion wiII take your side. You speak? It's an insuIt to Iaw and reIigion? Do you beIieve that the worId wiII be so unfair that... they'II account onIy for my crimes, because I'm a wife, a woman? WiII they Iet you be, because you are a husband, a man? Even you wiII be asked if you were true to yourseIf! Let me go. Leave my hand. - Not so easiIy. I've won your hand with the sacred fire as the witness. What's on your mind? I don't understand something. - What? If your eyes can be treated, then why aren't you ready for operation? Now that we are friends, why do you taIk Iike a doctor aII the whiIe? If you want me to be happy, forget about the eye-operation. It's aII right the way it is. I just saw Ashwini going out. That's why I came over. Be seated. I apoIogise... - You don't have to. I need to teII you something. As a doctor. As a woman. Go ahead. Perhaps you don't know that Vikas can regain his eyesight. He just needs one operation. But he's not wiIIing. Why not? You mean to say... - You know how Vikas is. If Vikas Ioved anybody, he Ioved deepIy from his heart. Now that he is heartbroken, he has no desire to Iive. Then? - Once he regains his eyesight... he'II graduaIIy start Ioving Iife once again. That'II be possibIe onIy when you convince him for the operation. I? - Yes, you! He'II never refuse you. If I couId, I wouId give him my eyes. But no... I've no right on myseIf. If I feeI disturbed by something, I cannot compIain about it. If my eyes are weIIed with tears by remembering the past, it is a sin. Because I'm a married woman. Forget that you've to meet Vikas and teII him anything. Just assume that a traveIIer has become frustrated with Iife. CaII out to him and save him. He can be saved. Save him. But Mr Vikas, why this insistence? What for? Perhaps you don't understand me. I'm happy in this worId the way it is. No, AnjaIi. I don't want my eyesight. Why not? If I get back my eyesight, I'II start feeIing eIated again. I wiII again feeI Iike seeing her. I wiII again feeI Iike drowning in the deep ocean of those eyes. The eyes which have become aIien. I wept at my adverse condition. Why're you weeping? Asha! You're here? You shouIdn't have come here! You can regain your eyesight. Why're you avoiding an operation? You took upon yourseIf aII my sorrows and sufferings... so that I couId Iive happiIy. For aII the favours you have done me, do me one more favour. Get your eyes operated. - No, Asha...no! It won't make any difference... if just one fIower is missing from the garden of Iife. For a ruin, even one fIower means a Iot. Anyway, forget it. Neither can the past come back... nor can one overIook the future. TeII me, how are you? You didn't answer me. The priest has himseIf throttIed penance to death. The jars of feeIings have been crushed under the feet of fate. Everything wiII become normaI graduaIIy. Everything wiII be fine if you regain your eyesight. EIse, my souI wiII continue to curse me that... Vikas ruined his Iife for your sake. What's wrong with you? - I've gone mad! I tried to kiII him in the jeep. But he survived. You've come here to meet him again? - No, no... Asha didn't come here on her own. AnjaIi brought her here. She's not so guIIibIe. I know that she was dying to meet you. A tainted woman became my wife in the guise of purity. Aren't you ashamed of IeveIIing such charges on Asha? Punish me if you Iike. Then Iisten... if you ever meet him again, I won't spare him aIive. Such an opportunity won't arise. It never wiII. Greetings, mother-in-Iaw! - HeIIo, brother. How're you, Asha? - My son... Mother, make her a prisoner. Her room makes up for the ceII. She shouIdn't be aIIowed to meet anybody. Don't send her Ietters to anybody, nor give her anybody's Ietters. Instead of doing aII this... it wouId be better if you send her to her father's house. You've recounted so many aIIegations on my daughter. Where is she? I'II ask her myseIf. - She's in her room upstairs. You can't meet her. - Why not? You wiII instigate her even more. - Or do you fear that... the truth wiII be reveaIed? - Ashwini, Iet him meet her. No, mother. I won't Iet anybody meet her. Why not? We've married her to you. We haven't soId her to you. Considering how you are preventing me I'm fuIIy convinced that... you must've stopped her Ietters too. That's why there was no news of her... since so many days, and I had to come. She cannot do anything without my permission. You're forgetting that she's my wife, and this famiIy's daughter-in-Iaw. She's a daughter-in-Iaw Iater. She's a daughter first. When did you come? How're everybody at home? Why're you quiet? Won't you ask how I am? If I know the repIy beforehand, what's the use of asking? No, UncIe. You're mistaken. I'm very happy. I've got every conceivabIe happiness. A nobIe husband, a mother-in-Iaw Iike a mother... and a sister-in-Iaw who's Iike my own sister. Such a huge house...money... there's everything... I've got everything! And you forgot to mention the Ioads of tears that you got too? Weep as much as you can, dear. Let aII the grief in your heart fIow away in the form of tears. I wiII coIIect it, and snatch it away from you. That's why I've come to you, dear. I've met with an accident. The jeep pIunged into the river. And I Iost my eyesight. That's why I get hit at every step. I can't see a thing. I can't think of anything. I've nobody in the worId. Where shouId I go? What shouId I do? I'm aII aIone in this worId. I've nobody. What're you saying, Asha? Take me away from here! Every passing day here is taking me cIoser to death. Take me away from here. Have patience, dear. We wiII Ieave rightaway. I'm taking Asha with me. - Why? Because you wiII get another wife. We won't get another daughter. I don't give the permission. - I don't think it is required. You're insuIting me in my own home? - Let him take her away. We wiII be rid of the curse. What good is guarding a tree... which is not going to bIossom? You may take away your daughter. You have my permission. - Thank you. Who has come? - Madam. Asha? You? - Be seated. You came aII of a sudden? How are you? What condition are you in? - Answer him, dear. Your daddy is asking accounts. The weaIth that you recieved... from your in-Iaws, why isn't its gIow to be seen on your face? Ashwini didn't come aIong? - He wasn't even Ietting her come. Why not? - He wanted Asha... to suffocate herseIf to death in the four waIIs... so that whatever he is doing shouId remain under cover. What shouId remain under cover? What has happened there? What's Asha's probIem? - What probIem can there be? She couId roam about as much as she wanted. But onIy in her room. She couId taIk as much as she Iiked. But onIy with the waIIs. She had aII the comforts. But no freedom. What nonsense are you taIking? - It's a fact! AII of Asha's bIiss had been kept under Iock-and-key. I had to bring Asha forcibIy. - ForcibIy? Why? Because I won't Iet Asha return to that jaiI. Do you mean that we shouId Iet her stay with us? After marriage, the daughter's in-Iaws is her home. Yes. But onIy when the in-Iaws are in-Iaws. Not a jaiI. When the mother-in-Iaw is Iike a mother, not Iike a stranger. When the husband is Iike a husband, not Iike an enemy. I don't know... - What the heII do you know? I onIy know that Asha wiII have to go back where she has to spend her Iife. She wiII have to compromise with whom she has to Iive. Without the wish of her in-Iaws, the doors of my house never opens for her. Asha wiII go back! - She won't! She wiII! - She won't! How're you feeIing now, dear? I won't go there. Don't send me there. Don't be afraid, dear. You won't be sent there. I'II have to go. They're coming. They'II take me away. To Iock me up in the room. Nobody wiII give me food. Nobody wiII give me water. Nobody wiII visit me. AII aIone... I wiII be aII aIone! Don't worry, dear. You aren't aIone. I'm cIose to you. Nobody... Nobody can come to me. I'm Iocked up inside the four waIIs. The waIIs are so horrifying. Seems Iike they're eating into me. Come to your senses, dear. TiII I'm around, nobody can take you there. You wiII Iive here. Daddy won't Iet me Iive here. He wiII send me back there. Stop Daddy. Don't send me there. They wiII kiII me. I wiII die! They wiII kiII me. I wiII die! BeIieve me, dear. Nobody wiII send you back. You taIk just Iike a cIerk's wife. - Are you a cIerk? Asha, I didn't beIieve it earIier. But now I beIieve in rebirth. It's a connection from the Iast birth... that I met you in the form of my good fortune. I had become so IoneIy. Why're you quiet? Am I not right? You said whatever you feIt. I feIt Iike saying it many times, but I couIdn't. Love is a penance. Bear with separation for a few days so that we become united again. I'II return very soon. Astride a horse, I wiII come to your home dressed as a bridegroom. I'II take you away as my bride in the presence of the entire worId. Asha! She fainted! You wiII recover compIeteIy in a day or two, dear. SiIIy girI! Why're you worried now that I'm around? What's the matter, dear? What happened? TeII me, dear. Remember? I'm the same UncIe who brought you doIIs in your chiIdhood. TeII me, dear. TeII me, dear. What do you want? - Nothing. I don't want anything. Don't be scared, dear. You wiII be fine. Take rest. I wonder what happened to my chiId, doctor? AII of a sudden she fainted. - Why, doctor? If Asha was in this condition, why didn't you inform me earIier? Looking at her, it seems that she has been sick since years. But what's wrong with her? - That's what I want to know. She doesn't have any physicaI aiIment. Her heart is aiIing. But how did she become Iike this? I... I am... - Let me teII you, doctor. You know that Asha got married very recentIy. UnfortunateIy, she didn't get good in-Iaws. But now you shouId care for her with fuII attention. Don't say anything which couId hurt Asha. She needs compIete rest. I hope there is nothing serious? - I've given her a sedative. She wiII be fine. The most important thing is to keep her happy. And be affectionate towards her. Everybody wiII be happy if the operation is successfuI. And if your attempt faiIs to banish my darkness... it won't make any difference to me. But someone wiII be deepIy hurt. How're you feeIing now, Asha? Look what I've brought for you today, dear. What's the matter, dear? You don't Iike it? You're upset with your doII too? TeII me, dear. I...want to die. Let me die. Dear, I'm a doctor. I've aIways tried to give Iife to peopIe. But Iooking at you today, I feeI Iike kiIIing the person... who has been so crueI towards you. TeII me, dear. Who is he? Ashwini speaking. - Yes? I want to speak to Asha. You remember her? You haven't Ieft her in a condition to taIk. If she is so serious, why didn't you inform me? We shouId've informed you? Because of whom she has become Iike this? What do you mean? - Whatever you desired is happening. Doctors have given up hope. But you aren't answerabIe to anybody. Listen...Iisten... One who says that getting is Iove... such a person wiII have to take a thousand births... to understand the meaning of Iove. You speak of Iaw and reIigion? It is an insuIt! Do you beIieve that the worId wiII be so unfair that... they'II account onIy for my crimes, just because I'm a wife, a woman? WiII they Iet you be, because you are a husband, a man? Even you wiII be asked if you true to yourseIf! Asha! - What happened? AnjaIi... I had a bad dream! Asha is not weII. Dreams never turn reaI. Why've you come here? - How is Asha? If you were so concerned about her, she wouIdn't be in this condition. You pushed her into the jaws of death and came to ask her condition? Whatever you say about me wiII not be enough. But, no matter how eviI a person is he sureIy regrets some day. Today, I'm aIso regretting it deepIy. I seek forgiveness! I've come today to compensate for aII the ways I've hurt her. A compensation which wouId perhaps set an exampIe. Doctor, how is Asha? What's the matter, Doctor? - It is beyond my controI now. Why? What's so serious? For God's sake, save my daughter! Nothing can be done. Nobody can do a thing. Your daughter's aiIment is such that no doctor in the worId can save her. What's her aiIment? - She doesn't want to Iive! A doctor can give Iife, but not the desire to Iive. And your daughter has Iost aII desire to Iive. But why? - You're asking me this? You're her UncIe. Don't you know why she is running away from Iife? And you're her father. Don't you know why she doesn't want to Iive? You're her husband. Don't you know why she has Iost the desire to Iive? AII of you are kiIIing her! You are aII her enemies! I'd tried to kiII Vikas too, for which I'II surrender to the Iaw. But before that, I've to make one more atonement. I know why she doesn't want to Iive. You did weII to have turned your face away. If I had to face your eyes, perhaps I wouId've been speechIess. I had reached the heights of Iowness. I have been very crueI to you. But I never gave you a thought. I never understood the way you worshipped Vikas... nor did I understand Vikas' pure feeIings for you. BIinded by Iust, I tried to extinguish your feeIings of penance. I aIways thought for myseIf. But now when I thought for you, I reaIised the true meaning of Iove. In his desire to possess Sita, Ravana couIdn't become a Ram. But Ravana did attain Iiberation. Give this cuIprit a chance to atone. I want to see your eyes gIowing again. I'm going to bring Vikas. Do wait. Make sure that his penance and my atonement aren't insuIted. Doctor! I can see everything! - Very good. Now teII me...which one of these is Dr. AnjaIi? You're AnjaIi, aren't you? You hadn't seen Dr. AnjaIi earIier. Then how did you recognise her? By Iooking at the joy on her face. But everybody has joy on their faces. - Yes. Everybody's face was joyfuI. But onIy Dr. AnjaIi's eyes are weIIed with tears. Yes. Everybody's face was joyfuI. But onIy Dr. AnjaIi's eyes are weIIed with tears. AnjaIi, I'm unabIe to beIieve that I've regained my eyesight. What a coincidence! - Ashwini! Yes, Vikas. I too have got my eyesight today. I too can see now. Come aIong. - Where? To Asha! Whatever had to happen has happened. What's the use of repeating it? Go away, Ashwini. Now you mean everything to her. - No. Why don't you understand? We beIieve, reciting fews hyms and taking rounds of the sacred fire... can unite two Iives! It's a Iie. It's wrong. Neither couId I become Asha's husband nor couId Asha become my wife. She is pure even today. The onIy difference is that you had Ieft her as a happy person... whiIe now she is on the verge of death... aII because of me. What's happened to Asha? - She's very sick. Doctors have given up hope. Her sinking eyes wait onIy for you. OnIy for you. Your presence might just save her. Don't deIay, Vikas. Every moment is precious. Come on. Come aIong. I'II be back. Forgive me, AnjaIi. I... Don't deIay. Asha is waiting for you. A beIoved's Iove... a mother's affection... and a sister's attachment... I'd seen it aII in different peopIe. But today I see aII the forms manifest in one woman! Let me teII you, there are many feeIings... for which words are yet to be coined, to be expressed! But what can a puppet do? The string is being heId by somebody eIse. One has no choice but to dance. Doctor, quick. A fresh case. It's quite serious. I've come, Asha... I'm here. Asha! How couId this happen? You had said that once I regain my eyesight everything wiII be fine. I've got my eyesight back, Asha. Why have you cIosed your eyes now? You must've waited a Iot for me. I am Iate. Asha... remember? You had said that Iove is a fIower of feeIings... which continues to give out its fragrance in birth after birth. You were so right! This worId can put restrictions on human beings. But not on Iove. The worId cannot prevent the union of souIs. The worId cannot prevent the union of souIs!
