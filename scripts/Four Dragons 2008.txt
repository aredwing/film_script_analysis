As a result of this discovery, throngs of laborers migrated from South China. Many were deluded by the dream of the tin rush. But they were treated as slaves. Living conditions were harsh. They worked the land without reservations. In the transition of time, the people and land were woven into one. Though foreign yet familiar, the enchanting land became home to many. Where's the money? From sunrise to sunset, this is the order of nature. Do you hear me? You're gonna pay us. We thought our destiny was in our own hands. I'm not asking you again. But we were susceptible to what our minds would allow us to believe. I want my money now! You hear me? Tin Sok fostered four young men under his care. With resilience and persistence, they triumphed in these turbulent times. Dragon-- full of integrity, Ied by common sense, feared by all for his iron fists. Blaze-- reserved and scheming, an expert in the ancient art of T'ai Chi, cold, aloof, a rogue. Ace-- persistent, brave for a cause, goes all out, fights to the bitter end. Tiger-- impulsive, defies conventional wisdom, fast as lightning, light as a feather. Untold stories are abundant, filled with bliss and delight, pain and grief. Each is significant in their own right. Life is unkind to these miners as they toil the land every day, despite the forces of mother nature. Whether rain or shine, they have no one to turn to, nowhere to hide. Day in and day out, they toil the abundant land. Romance is the most beautiful melody in life. When sorrow looms and hope is in despair, this is the solace to soothe the desolation. Nice. - All right. - I don't like that one. Exhausted by labor, weary and worn out, what kept them motivated? Kept them from giving up? Would their loved ones from the homeland be able to feel their sorrows? Would they ever know the truth? Please, let me introduce my guest Mr. Yoshimura. How do you do, Mr. Yoshimura? Mr. Yoshimura is quite impressed with our cultural dance. Also, I'd like you to meet the head of our tin mine, Master Sam. - This is Tin Sok. - Oh, Tin Sok. - A pleasure. - It's an honor to meet you. And who are they? This is my beloved wife, my lovely daughter Dan Dan and her charming friend Rose from Great Britain. Please, won't you have a seat? The tin business has brought you great fortune. We've been partners for years and I'm very interested in the tin business. I may invest, as the potential is limitless. It's the same food every day. We work all the time with no days off. Yeah! Okay, Tiger's right. We'll go see Tin Sok and arrange a meeting with the boss. - With Master Hoong? - You with me? Tin Sok, we've never complained. But lately it's been real hard down there. - The men are mad. - They need rest. We're hoping that Master Hoong will help. Only you can arrange it. So will you help us? All right, you and Dragon can go. Okay. Should we go now? No, not yet. Master Hoong is a busy man. You'll wait and go on the 15th, the night of the full moon. It is the night of good fortune. - Both of you will wait here. - Okay. Master Hoong, two of the workers from the mine are here to see you. - Dragon and Tiger. - Let them in. Yes, sir. Master Hoong will see you now. - Hello, sir. - You're Dragon and you're Tiger? Yes, sir, we are. We have come here in the hopes that-- Tell Tin Sok that he doesn't need to worry about this matter. It'll be resolved soon enough. You and the other men will get all the rest you need. Thank you, sir. We will leave you now. You take care. Master Hoong, the Japanese investors have agreed to join with you. That's a good sign. So, are you interested in joining in? Of course. In that case, someone will have to be replaced. Well, it's the 15th, a perfect time for a little house-cleaning. Take these vegetables. They're set to go out. Oh, Tin Sok. Tin Sok. Okay, quiet. Quiet. It's the 15th of the month, a truly lucky day. Now just relax and enjoy your meal. We'll hope for good news from Dragon and Tiger. Go on, enjoy yourselves. Go on, sit down. - Right. - Okay. No one escapes. - Run! - Let's go. Him. Keep him here. Never mind it. Let's get out of here. No, don't! Save yourselves! Get away! What happened at the mine? What are you doing here? We were all betrayed by the boss. We were ambushed too. I don't understand. Why did all this happen? I don't know. Hey, where's Tin Sok? We got separated. We looked for him. Dragon was injured in the throat. I don't think he can talk. Weather is perfect today. Help. Help us. Hey, did you hear that? Hey, there's somebody in there. Come on. They're gonna need help. Let's take them back to the village. Come on. What happened to them? Who are they? Tin Sok! Tin Sok. Tin Sok. Tin Sok? Tin Sok? Tin Sok. - Abu. - Yeah? What's his condition? I think he's gonna be all right, Tok. - I will. - Don't push yourself. Just rest. Tin Sok? Tin Sok. They must mean my old friend Tin Sok. Abu, I want you to take the two of them along with you and go find Tin Sok. Leave as soon as they're able. But, Tok, I'm afraid that might put all of us in danger. Abu, just follow my orders. Yes, sir. Three months ago we settled in here. We worked the land day and night with hope that one day we would be able to return to our homeland and make a better living for ourselves. Because we've shed our sweat and our blood in this land from sunup to sunset, we've become part of it. It's become our new home. From now on we are family. This is where we eat, sleep and work. This is Tin Sok. He's the head of the mine. Tin Sok! I want you to know I realize your arrival here has not been easy for you. Therefore I offer some advice, that is: follow the rules of the mine to the letter. The leaders will help you if you need it. But be forewarned, escape is out. Make no attempt at it. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Work hard and you'll all do really well here. Someday you will be free men. - Dragon. - Sir. Dragon will give out the work assignments. He will teach you whatever you need to know for your respective jobs. - Blaze. - Sir. Blaze will arrange for your lodging. Need I remind you that work in the mines is exhausting? I suggest you use your rest time to do just that. - Ace. - Sir. Ace will explain all the rules and regulations. It's imperative you follow them. If you have any questions at all, ask Ace. - Tiger. - Sir. Take them to get cleaned up. From now on there is no more fooling around here. And finally, the cutting of the braid ceremony. It signifies a new beginning. It makes us aware that we cannot return to our homeland. Yes. Yes. I urge you all to embrace this moment. It is most definitely a turning point in your life. Yes. Yes. Watch out. Run! I never thought that the 15th of the month would bring such a terrible nightmare. - Run! - Let's go. Let's get out of here. Come on. We killed someone. Run. What really happened that day? What will be our future? Do we even have one? Are we doomed? I wish I could keep the workers who are already on the job. But as the business grows, I need new blood that I can trust in order to complete the expansion. I built this business from the beginning and I will not see it fail. I will not tolerate anyone who may hinder the process. I have no choice but to take matters into my own hands. Master Sam will arrive soon. Assist him any way you can. Yes, Master Hoong. My daughter Dan Dan wishes to make a visit to the tin mine. You will go with her. Yes, Master Hoong. Watch out, hot water. - Hey! - Oh, sorry. Don't get worked up. He didn't mean it. Buy I just washed these clothes. - It's beautiful. - It is our culture. It is really peaceful here. Your father owes us money and we want it. Hear me? Don't think you can hide from us. What's happening? You got that? What are those men doing? It's nothing. Our mine workers are involved. It's okay. Enough! Come on. - You all right? - Yeah. - You disappeared. - No I didn't. We told you to stay close. Well, now what? Let's keep it going. We'd better stop now. Take off. It's none of your business. I'm sorry, miss. Your father didn't intend for this. Come on, let's go. Over here. Come on, bring it this way. I've got three more over here. Bring 'em in, bring 'em in. Hey, bring that ore so I can check it. Right. Takes you forever to get a couple of bags of rice. Hurry up. Miss Dan Dan will be here soon. Bring in the horses. Careful careful. Here it is. You want to help me with this? Oh, Tin Sok. Tin Sok. Tin Sok. Bring it over here, guys. Let's go. Three more. Good job, boys. Keep it up. - Miss Dan Dan. - How are you, Tin Sok? - He's the head of the mine, Tin Sok. - Oh, Tin Sok. This is Rose. She's my friend. Oh, Rose. Your friend from abroad. Yeah, I was really hoping I might show her the mine. Wonderful. I'll show you around. Thank you. Tried to escape again? What did I tell you? I warned you about the rules of the mine. - Stop it. What is the problem? - He tried to escape. - What's happening? - I don't know. Take him away. - Tin Sok. - All right, it's all over. Everyone back to work. Tin Sok, why did those guards beat the worker? Oh, um... we'll talk about it later, miss. Hey, look. It's the girl we saw earlier. It's the boss's daughter. This way. Now this is the kitchen. It may seem a bit crude but everyone manages just fine. Like a big family, you know? - Dan Dan, over here. - Huh? Oh. Tin Sok, what did the worker do that he had to be beaten? Um, the rules say no one escapes. Anyone caught will be punished. But we shouldn't abuse them. Not like that. Mmm. I'll discuss it with your father. Yes, I'll do that as well. But it's really the worker's fault. They were warned of the consequences. The harder they work, the sooner they will be free. Huh, it's pretty good quality. You'd better put these on the chart. Right. So have you decided yet how you're going to punish that kid? They're young and impulsive. Let's give him a break. Tin Sok, there are rules. They just have to learn. If you're too easy you'll just make it worse. I know what they need-- Ieniency. They're just young. Come on. Come on. Get in there. You deserve it. How can they treat us like animals? They've gone too far. What did you do? A new guy, he needed my help. I'll tell Tin Sok. Hey, you okay? - What happened? - Wake up. - I think he fainted. - That's no excuse. Back to work. Get up. No sleeping. Leave him alone. - Hey! - Stop it! Back to work. Tin Sok. He overreacted. He's sorry. He's only a kid. Forget it. You're too lenient. What would I tell the boss? There's nothing I can do. He's suffered enough. Just let it go. Please. What if he gives up this week's pay? We have to follow the rules. They're just kids, hmm? We'll see how sorry he is. We'll talk to Master Hoong, ask him for a pardon. Wait here. I'll tell the master. Hmm. Sit down. Tin Sok, the master will see you. Right. Not you, Tiger. - Huh? - No, you wait here. - Oh. - And stay out of trouble. - Hi. - Hmm? - Miss Dan Dan. - Oh, weren't you at the mine earlier? Mmm, yeah. So what are you doing here then? Oh, I wish to seek a pardon from Master Hoong. From my daddy? - Daddy? - He's my papa. Oh yeah. That's right. I violated the rules over at the mine. What kind of rules were they? Tell me. I won't say anything. Really? This guy fainted and needed help so l, um, hit a guard. You attacked someone? I wonder why my dad never said anything. I'd like to know some more details. Well, you see there are rules of the mine that need to be followed. I chose not to. I'm sorry, miss. You don't have to be sorry. Please, I don't even know your name. What is it? My name is Tiger. Tin Sok, what brings you here? There must be a reason. The mishap at the mine. I ask your pardon. The what? He may have acted without thinking, but he is sorry and asks your pardon. Tin Sok, you've always handled these worker matters at the mine, haven't you? I'm thinking this problem is up to you. I'm concerned about something-- the workers, you know, and their safety. Tin Sok, for years now you and I have handled this business. But times are changing, right? Actually, the buyers are paying exceptionally well these days. Huh? I mean, we wouldn't want to do something to change that Iike anger the client. Got me? Yes, I understand, master. But the miners are getting overworked, sir. Tin Sok, I wouldn't worry yourself. A solution is on its way. In that case, sir, we'll wait for your good news. Old friend, don't ever forget that we are family. Hello. Rose, over here. Where is he going? I'll tell you later. We only met once, but since then I can't get his face out of my mind. Is it possible that I am falling in love? Is life at the mine very difficult? Yes, it is. But I guess this is our fate. We work hard in hopes of a better life. Things have improved since we met Tin Sok. No. It can't be. Don't you hear me? Don't you know I want you? Why? Stop. - Here, drink. - No no no. - No. - Drink. Really? Look at this. What's wrong with me? I'm all wet. I want you to have this. It's my lucky charm. So do you have plans for the future? I want to be like Tin Sok. - Tin Sok? - Yes. He's very kind and dignified. Grab him. Get him in there. Get in there. - Give me the rope. - No, please. Give it to me. Hold still, old man. Please! Please! No. Hey, look. Look, there's another one. There've been too many. I've come to the end of my journey. My only last concern is my daughter Ling. Whoever finds this, please take care of her. From a disgraced old man. I know-- I know I should not be gambling. But I believe it's the only way I might be able to help Ling. Here. This is for you. I'm glad to see you're happier now. I have something else for you. I've brought everything I've ever saved. I want you to have it. Just take it. It's yours now. I have to go, okay? Hey, you take care. Be well. Goodbye. After this day I don't know when or if we will meet again. It seems everything may change after the night of the 15th. The night of the attack. But who is responsible? Who? No one escapes. What did I do to deserve this? I don't understand. Who did this? Who did this? Master Hoong, how are you? Master Sam, welcome. This way, please. It's great to see you. Sit. I have come with a proposition. What did you have in mind? Have some tea. Well, you see, we've been partners for years now and I'm still considering investing in your business. Just one thing-- I'm concerned about this clansman of yours, the one called Tin Sok. Are you thinking of taking his place? Tin Sok, the things you asked for are ready. It's late. Get some rest. We have a piece of jade that represents our brotherhood. Oh? We each have one. It is quite fine. Really? Oh, you're right. This is superior quality. Fine piece of jewelry. Oh, Tin Sok has men who are very skilled. Do I need to be worried at all? Forest? Yes, that's right. There are four workers from the mine. They are Dragon, Tiger, Ace and Blaze, Master Hoong. I don't get it. Why do l have to do this every time? He never tells anybody else. It's not fair. It's always me. It's not fair. He'd rather teach everybody else other than me. Thought we were family. - Good morning. - Yeah. We have to wait here. I don't understand him sometimes. Yeah, he's always been this way. Quit being so nosey, both of you. You're right. Hey, I wonder what we're gonna learn today. Aside from Tin Sok and l, there was Shao who passed away. - Oh? - It was the three of us. We started this thing together - Hmm. - Everything I've made - I owe to the two of them. - Mmm. - As I recall, Shao had a son. - Oh? Uh, Sand? Yes, right. He had a son. He's now one of Tin Sok's men. He goes by the name of Blaze. He's a very skilled fighter. - Longevity and good health. - Which clan? - Honor and peace. - How many rings? - Four rings. - Oh, Tin Sok's man. - Yes. - You can go in. What is the secret behind this box? Why is there jade in here? What is Tin Sok's secret? Blaze, huh? Yes, he was raised by Tin Sok. Oh. It's possible this could be of use. May I borrow it from you for a little while? Certainly, go ahead. Also, since I'm new here and haven't hired any men, I was wondering if you might have a few men of your own to spare. Of course. Forest and Sand are at your service. Great. Thank you. Oh, before I forget, I have a present for you. The Dragon Lord Triad emblem. Thank you. Master Hoong, I've-- I've never questioned your orders. He wants us to go and execute all of the workers, sir. It can't be right to just-- Forest, Master Sam, he knows what he's doing. Carry out his orders. Whoever defies me will die. After we waited, Tin Sok finally got to meet with Master Hoong. Hopefully Dragon and I will be able to bring back good news to the others. After the 15th our lives will have a new beginning and I can leave this way of living behind. What is the secret of the jade? I've got to find out. Will the 15th bring good fortune to us all? Will it be the dawn of a new day? - This is damak. - Mak? - No, damak. - Oh. Now listen, it may look harmless, however looks are deceiving. It's really quite lethal. Lethal? - Yes. - Oh. You both must learn how to master damak. Never let your enemies intimidate you. Hmm? Watch me. I have underestimated these boys. Oh, I'm glad you're both back. All right, tell me what's the situation? We have failed. The warehouse burned to the ground. And the assassins failed with the other two. All right, look, I think Tin Sok is still alive and his men will surely look for him. Go spread the word. I want them dead. I don't care what has to be done. Right. Master Hoong is looking for you. Yes, okay fine. Now go. Keep Blaze alive. He's useful. Give him this. He'll understand and know where to find me. - Yes, sir. - Go on now. Go go. And fortunately I have another plan. We have to look for Tin Sok. The best place to start is searching all his favorite places. - I'll go this way. - Mm-hmm. Okay. - I'll check here, okay? - Right. Where could he be? Anybody here? Somebody here? Tin Sok? Tin Sok? Tin Sok. Tin Sok. Are you Tin Sok? Yes I am. I'm Abu, Tok Mat's friend. Let me help you. Be careful, Tin Sok. Tok Mat? Yes, I will take you to him. Who's Tok Mat? - You mean the village head? - Yes, that's right. Come on, I'll take you to a safer place. Tok, I have found Tin Sok. Hurry, Tok. Tok! Oh, bring him in, Abu. Over here. Tin Sok? Yes. Tok, the two who went searching with me, I've lost track of them. Never mind. We'll wait till daybreak. If they're not back then, we'll send a party. Yes, Tok. How are all my boys? Don't worry. They are safe. Except there was one who was injured. He cannot speak. - Abu, let Tin Sok rest. - Yes. Come on, let's go. Master Hoong, try our latest commodity. It's an excellent crop. Ah, before long we'll start selling it. Then we'll be rich, won't we? This weasel will stop at nothing for a profit. I'm in good hands. You've done quite well. I told you that we make a perfect team, didn't l? But business at the parlor is rather slow. Don't worry. I've come up with a great plan. Listen, you're looking for a new person to head the mine. We'll arrange a contest to fill the position. But we'll know the winner. What a sly old fish. It's too peaceful here, as if something terrible is about to happen. Don't think like that, dear. Aunty Cheung, haven't you noticed lately that Father's work and his business partners are somewhat suspicious? I never doubt him. He has a reason for what he does. Aunty Cheung, I was wondering about your marriage to my dad. Was it an arranged marriage? That's right. That's the way it's always been. It's a tradition that's been passed down through the ages. In the long run it has served us well. But they're strangers, aren't they? Yes, that may be the case, dear. But relationships grow, like your father's and mine. What about me? What if I were to marry? I'm sure your father will arrange a marriage to someone of equal status to yours. You see, Dan Dan, women should just let a man do as he will. Like when your mama was still alive she'd let your dad do as he needed, just as I will. We are to stand at his side. Your father needs you to stand at his side. I just thought that destiny was in our hands. You know, Mom said that she always thought Tin Sok and Dad were just alike. I thought things were great. Then suddenly, Tin Sok's missing and his men are gone. Now they're looking for a successor for Tin Sok. And someone else is missing. Who are you talking about, Dan Dan? No one. Tiger, where are you? Should I wait? Or try and forget you? These honest and hardworking poor souls, do they have any idea what the future holds for them? Huh? You, mind your own business. Give the kid a chance. You'd better get going. Come on, let's go get that guy. Never mind him. Go after Ace. I'll look for Blaze. Go on. Where are they? We even found Tin Sok. Why aren't they back? I don't get it. Shall we look for them? It's Ace! Run! They're after us! Let's get him inside. Force them out. Let's go. Come on. This way. Careful, Dragon. It's a trap! Here. What's the secret behind this second jade? Could it be that Tin Sok killed my father? This jade is the link to your father's death that you've been looking for. The bearer of this jade, the one responsible, is Tin Sok. Master Sam. We hereby announce that to restore the leadership in the tin mine a contest for head of the mine will be held. It is open to any qualified fighter to challenge for the position. It will be held on the night of good fortune, the 15th of the month. I want to thank you, Tok, for saving all of our lives. Don't mention it. We're friends, right? You stay as long as you like. No one can come here, not without my permission. Anyway, we should be getting our things together and leaving soon. I don't want to involve you or the villagers any longer. As long as I'm here no one can bring us harm. Come on, how about we go enjoy a good meal? Thank you very much. I owe my life to Abu for certain. He's the one who brought me here. We'll have time to heal. Tok Mat said it's safe. We've suffered some setbacks but now we can regroup and form a plan. Okay, ready. Again! On the night of the 15th we will claim justice. Is it because he killed my father that Tin Sok never entrusted me with the responsibilities of the others? Why does he put the blame on me? I have to know. I have to know the answers. Dragon, thanks for meeting me. I have to talk to you. It's Ace and his addiction. I've known about it from the very beginning. Every day he goes gambling. Mmm. I just thought you should know. There's a reason, you know. But I can't tell you what it is right now. Let's meet again tomorrow near the lake. You'll learn the entire truth then. - All right? - Mm-hmm. Tomorrow then. Is Ace really gambling that much? And what about Blaze? Do I think I can trust him? I'm sorry, Dragon. Don't blame me. I only wanted justice served. Who murdered my father? Who was it? Since you're here, and by your tone I take it that you've read the letter, and the truth lies in this little piece of jade. So in the days to come, I've arranged for you to take over the mine. But Dragon, your brother, will try to see that you don't succeed. But there's a way to stop that. Dragon Lord Triad will show you all you need to know to help you to lure him. Pretty easy, huh? Well? Huh? Grab ahold of this opportunity, or pass it by. Then I will pass you the symbol of the Dragon Lord today. I will avenge my father's death. I'm meeting Blaze by the lake. It's something regarding Ace. Dragon. Why? Why? Why would you betray us? I thought we were brothers. After the night of the 15th, the night of good fortune... there will be no going back. I never would have guessed that Blaze would react like his father. But I truly believe that Dragon will go with us into the arena. His spirit will be there. Today justice will be ours. We will avenge you, Dragon. Dragon... we will make sure your death had a reason. The arena will be our witness. We will claim our justice! Greetings, my friend. This is Master Hoong. Master Hoong. This is Master Sam. Master Sam. Master Sam, this is very well set up. Yes, and it's very lucrative. Look at the size of the turnout today. Can I have your attention? We are here today thanks to Master Hoong. Isn't this a grand arena? We are here today to elect a new leader. The strongest challenger shall win. Everybody who thinks they're worthy can enter. And in the end, the last man standing here is our new leader. Introducing... Blaze Blaze Blaze... Master Hoong, this is the young man who is going to win. He'd better win. You arranged for it, right? Yes, no need to worry. He will win. Tin Sok, Tiger and Ace. And you, I'm disappointed in you. Ace. You're not worthy of this place. You are a man without a heart. I'm not the one without a heart. Let's see who it is, hmm? Ace, get up. How could you? Tell me how. Go on! We were all brothers! Or so I thought. Is that right? You thought wrong. I never thought of any of us as brothers. Now let's see who walks out. Justice is on our side. We'll see who is the supreme fighter. This match was fought to a draw. Now the arena is open to the next challenger. Tiger, you can do it. Victory must be mine. He's more skilled than I thought. Tiger! You've got to stand. In the year 1884, Malaya is considered the largest tin exporter in the world. Yet accounts of what happened in 1881 are destined to repeat themselves. Imbalance of the powerful and struggles of the deprived Iinger on in uncertainty. Is it that time creates heroes? Or are heroes created out of time?
