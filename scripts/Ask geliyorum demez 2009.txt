Turk, Kurd, Armenian, Laz, Circassian... ...all after bread money. In this place we earn our bread money. Hamdi Market Place is like a It has witnessed so many earthquakes, financial crises and catastrophes... ...but still standing solid and provides a business environment. The businessmen here are good. They concentrate on their business however sarcasm never ends. C'mon boys, lets finish the packing. It is our only sale nowadays. The financial crisis has fu... found us already. The shipment must be on time. - Good morning, Nafiz. - Good morning, son of a Laz. By the way, my name is Nuri. I run a tea shop in Hamdi Market Place. In short, I serve tea. As I very quickly go in and out of the shops they call me Jet Nuri. - Jet Nuri! Where are the teas? - They are on the way. He is demanding as if he is the best customer. - Nuri, bring me a tea! - One minute, I am coming. You share those. I don't want to hear any objections. They would be more than enough for you, bullocks. Have a good day. Just give 2. - Nafiz, can I cash the tokens now? - How much? You are 4 people and each of you drink 2 teas every day. You haven't paid me for 2 months. - If you pay me 120 TL it is settled. - What the hell are you... I mean what are you saying, son? We always drink light teas. Light means half. I have never served here half, Nafiz. But we always drink light teas and light means half. - What do you mean by half? - Halfmeans light. I pay you half of 120, which is 60 and if we round it that makes 50. You would get nothing from me if the crisis had really hit us. Nafiz, when it comes to the payment, you always give me hard time. What would have happened if the crisis had really hit you? You've just heard. He wants to rob us. There are no more teas fortoday. - Good morning, uncle. - Thanks, Nuri. Look, there are 3 things that can not be hidden son smoke, love and poverty. - Rememberthat! - You are the greatest Uncle Miran! - May I tell you something? - Tell me, son. Let's say that yourteam has conceded... ...6 goals although played very well. How can you hide that? Get lost you ass! It has been so many years and you still mention it? We have scored 6 goals, what a great team is Fenerbahce! - Then you should not have given away. - Shut up! Atilla, isn't this panties small forthat ass? - Do you know the saying? - What saying, Atilla? A path is better if goes down hill, an ass is better if looks like a big hill. Is that so? You are great, Atilla. Have a nice day. - Fenerbahce is the greatst! - Get lost! What's up, Cemal? Thanks, bro. One day we will all see the sun. He has already had sun stroke. He doesn't need more sunshine. Common you athletic revolutionist. The supporter of oppressed people. Look! He has just seen the sun! Give him a hand, don't laugh. I can't help him. I have work to do. You never pee on a wounded finger. You, get up! Are you still trying to postpone the fucking payment? Send my goods back. Have a good day, Laz Dursun. Isn't it hard to talk on the phone like that? What kind of a guy you are, Nuri? But you are absolutely right. As usual. - Have a good day. - Thanks. Where have you been you son of a gun? Here I am, bro. Name of a vegetable with 5 letters, starts with b ends with s. Balls. Brans. Fuck off, you bastard. Neither balls nor brans. I'm going. It is beans. - Good morning, principal. - Good morning, Nuri. I am leaving it here. I have bought a pull out couch forthe porters' room. I'll take care of it, principal. Hi pa. - Ali bro. Where have you been? - I am working on it, Nuri. One day I'll work on you too. I am going to bring to tea. - Two sugars. - I know. I told you to come earlierto help. Now it's already noon. We are sending goods to our customers. Why didn't you come sooner? Don't be mad at me. Here I am, ready to help. You talk as if you don't know traffic in stanbul. Father, these are so nice. It has got a butterfly, too. Every home needs one of these. Leave it! You don't need it. Either help or leave. Which shop belongs to Ali the inglorious? That panties store overthere. Poor guy is in trouble again. Attention everybody! Movie is about to start in Principal Ismail's store! Don't do this. - Lets go and have a look. - Nevermind. - Let's not miss it. - OK. Please take care ofmy stand. Ali! Oh, shi... Sebnem! Welcome to our store Sebnem. I was expecting you. - Don't touch me. - OK, I wont. Tea or coffee, tea? Nuri, bring us tea. You are such a dishonest person! You should be more polite as my father is at present. I am sorry sir... ...but your son is such a... - Punk! Yes! I've seen your photos with... ...Necla eker on Facebook. You have become friends. Your photos have been tagged. ebnem, look! Necla is my childhood friend. We used to attend Quran lectures... ...at a local mosque together. I swear. - May God forgive our sins! And she is the one who hits on me. Is that why she has the same one? Alex crossed the ball... It is coming... Yeah, goal! You are not a human! Bravo. Bravo. Everybody, back to business. What do you think you are doing. Watching a movie? Father, I swear I am innocent. Son, this place is where we earn our bread money. Because of you, we are falling short of the grace of God. - Second half of the movie. - C'mon everyone! Everything is OK. What a bastard you are! What a bastard you are! Welcome Necla. - ebnem is my friend from... - Quran lectures. No, she is one ofmy mom's friends' daughter. Boo! She has been hitting on me, I swear. I'll kill you, I'll kill you! I'll kill you with my own hands! Look Necla, Michael Jackson! What Michael? Come here, I'll give you a lesson. He has spent all of his money on jewelry. You bastard! Nice. The construction must be done without damaging the facade. You are right, sir. Nice, very nice. - Send the notification. - Aye sir! - Tea man! Who is in charge of this place? - Hello. Would you like something to drink? I said who is in charge of this place. - Abuzuttin? - Who? That's what I said. The first store, sells panties. Everyone knows it. Have a sunny day, dear. Small businesses, it is good that we will tear here down. I hate this kind of places. Welcome sir, it is an honor. May I offer you something to drink. Erdoan Akbayrak is the new landlord of this market place. This place will be turned into a shopping mall. You have one month to evacuate. What are you saying? Read this, don't waste my time. Now friends, this Erdoan Akbayrak... ...the crook has fooled the landlord and bought the place. We have to evacuate this place in one month. There is law and justice. We can apply to municipality, talk to governor. I know, but we don't have any contracts or any written documents. What are we going to say to the governor? At that time promise was enough for us. Business was used to work that way. One's word is one's bond. That bastard, Erdoan must have close relations... ...both with government and municipality. Then we should make a protest. He is right. Once people of Bergama have blocked the roads. What happened at the end? They could not stop the gold diggers in theirtown. Then we should shoot or stab him. What are you saying? It is not like sacrificing a hen! How can you shoot him? People say that he has 500 armed men protecting him. - 500? - 600, 700. How should I know? No one has come out with a solution. I've just remembered the saying. "Turks invent either while shitting or running away". As I am unable to run away further with my lamed leg... ...I went to toilette with a newspaper. Gzde Akbayrak is organizing a charity night forthe benefit of "Friends of Nature". Eureka! Eureka! Eureka! I swear I found a solution! Eureka! I swear I found a solution! - What did you find? - What's that? We will conquerthe castle from inside. Operation Troy Horse! - What are you saying, son? - Look at this. The tycoon Erdoan Akbayrak's daughter Gzde Akbayrak is... ...organizing a charity night for the benefit of "Friends of Nature". OK, I agree. Cool it. In the past I have made some mistakes, darling. We all learn from ourmistakes. But now, I am not going to lie you. Leave those old fashioned sentences. - OK, my butterfly. - Do not call me butterfly. Alright, I won't. But listen... ...after I graduate next year I will go to UK formasters degree. Then I will go to my military service. After all those I will find a decent job and we will get married. Boo! Am I going to wait for you for - But my love... - I said no masters! Alright! No masters. Military service, decent job and then we will get married. But, before all those you will introduce me to yourfamily. Make a vow! I said, make a vow. I swearto God! If not I am cursed! Here is a piece of bread. I swear on this piece of bread and Quran. If I don't I will die from swine flu. Look... ...if you do not keep your promise I will make this word hell for you! Where are you ass, I've been looking for you whole morning! Yes, father? Why do you want me to read it? We are about to lose our business but you are still not aware of the danger. - You know, there are law and justice. - Forget the law. Listen! - I'm not just saying this... - We live in a state of law. The man has just managed to wangle in some way and bought the market place. We have been just left high and dry. So where is that state of law? Who's going to demand justice? Anyway, what was I saying? You are confusing me. Listen, I'm not just saying this because you are my son. You are such a handsome young blood. You have the gift of the gab and when it comes to women, you are the best. Speaking of which, I'm going to introduce you to Inci. Who is nci? If God allows, she will be your daughter in law. What are you talking about? You don't earn your living yet. How will you maintain a family? You have been living a life of ease until now. Life is not that easy, young man. You are always mad at me. I am going to fix everything. No need to worry. You are still not mature enough to know how to speak to yourfather. What does "I am going to fix everything" mean? Am I a watch? I've told you a thousand times to come and learn this business ofmine. Because of the financial crisis, educated young people are unemployed out there. At least after I'm gone... ...you could survive with this business. Don't start all over again for God's sake. How many times have we discussed about this? I will not run this business. Listen everybody, I will not run this business! Ok, don't run it. What was I saying? - Move. - When? Now. Come with me! - Where? - Come with me! - Is he going to accept, Nuri? - I don't know, Uncle Miran. But, it is possible... - What happened? - This bastard didn't let me talk. Ali has come. Just sit down. Get a cup of tea for him. Everyone is here. What a nice occasion! What is it, father? What the hell is going on here? Listen Ali. You are aware of the trouble we are dealing with. We have thought over it again and again, but could not find a way out. Then I had this brilliant idea. That bastard, Erdoan Akbayrak has a beautiful daughter. Like a Turkish delight. And you have this handsome face as a gift of God. Besides, you are an expert at this stuff. Cut it short, Nuri. Get straight to the point. We just think that if you steal that girl's heart... Really? What are you saying, man? Don't interrupt, just listen to me. If you steal that girl's heart... ...she will convince that jerk not to tearthis place down. In the worst case, when he turns this market place to a shopping mall... ...you can arrange a couple of shops for us. What the hell are you talking about? It is not possible. I've just made a vow to my girlfriend for not to flirt with anyone else. No way! Just look at this once. You don't understand, do you? I said I have made a vow. Just look at this picture. What do you have to lose? OK, give it to me. What happened? You are frozen. God forgive me. But this is not a human, this is an angel. That's what we are saying. Uncle, will my oath violated if I go for an angel? It will not. It will not. If it will be, I will die because of swine flu. I have decided to help my father. I will go on a business trip to Trabzon, Adana, Antep, Urfa... - ebin Karahisar, emigezek, Siirt. - Ali. My butterfly, everything is forthe sake of ourfuture. To make a good father and husband... ...and decent person ofme. Good. But if you don't behave yourself, I'll gouge your eyes out! Protection Organization". Send Me To School" campaign. With that money, I can buy the whole damn forest... ...and build a shopping mall over it. This girl will kill me! This girl will kill me! Daddy... What do you think of my new donations? I am proud of you. You are such a dutiful girl, just like me. Did you get the receipt of the rent of the hall I have paid forthe tomorrow's event? What event, my darling? The one we arranged forthe benefit of Friends of Nature. Are we to pay the rent? We are organizing it. Right. How much? It's nothing really. I've already paid it. - 60.000 TL. - 60.000 TL? OK, my darling. I don't know who you took after. If your late mother could see you now... ...she would be proud of you. And 60.000 forthe hall's rent. Let's see how much we have here. Total 160. That's all, 160. - 500 for principal. - To smail? What about Tahsin? - 750 for Tahsin. - He will have a heart attack. Don't expect much from me. How much did you write? It is a kind of formality; we know you are not going to pay. Nuri, I can pay 200. Anyone can give me a betting advice fortoday's horse-racing? You should bet on number 7. What is it, son? "The Association Of Charming Contractor's Daughter". We thought so much about it. How did you find it? C'mon bros. Lets raise some money forthe benefit of our association. you will get the rest later. OK, give it to me. I am getting 500 from Uncle Miran. Nafiz, we want 900 from you. There is an ache right here. C'mon Nafiz, don't fake it. Give me the money. Don't count, give me all of them. There is 400 here, I will take 500 from you later. I am putting ourmoney into the safe. Oh boy, you look like an anchovy. What do you think, Ali? It looks OK, I guess. But this trouser is too tight. - And it should be. - What do you mean "it should be"? - Just make it a bit more comfortable. - It should be a bit tight. Why? How I am going to talk to her like this? It should grab and squeeze your balls. What are you doing? I can not go to the cocktail like this. You should start from her hair. First you will fond her hair like this... ...then you will use your fingers like a comb. Therefore, she will get into yourfrequency. - Frequency? - Frequency. How is it? - Old fashioned. - This one? I didn't like the colour. What about this? - It is like... - Like what? You don't appreciate my art. You should touch her waist just like this. But, if you really want to turn her on... ...you must work on her neck. - Neck? - Neck. What will you say this time? - Nice. - Try it on, then. I will fix you something... ...just because it is for a mission. And her hips, the most lustful... Oops, don't enterthere. We were about to enterthe best place. Just leave it for now, you will enter later. By the way if I manage attract herthat will be because of you. You are my master. You shine like a new penny, kid. Drive it carefully, bro. I borrowed it from my cousin. Please take a good care of it. OK, don't worry, Cemal. Take this. Let's see what you will do. You look like an actor. Don't forget the lectures! Don't let us down. - Don't drive so fast. - Let's go. Operation is on! Dear guests, thank you for joining us... ...on this night organized for the benefit of Friends of Nature. I would like to present to you the hostess of this beautiful evening... ...Ms. Gzde Akbayrak! Welcome you all. Dearfriends of nature, I know you all are very sensitive about this issue... ...so I'll cut it short, don't worry. There is an Indian saying that goes... "We do not want to harm trees. Whenever we have to cut them down... ...we offerthem some tobacco in return. We never waste any wood. We take only what we need and we use all of it. If we don't considertheirfeelings and not offerthem some tobacco in return... ...all the othertrees will weep forthem. And that would hurt us." We should give before we take. I would like to thank in advance all friends of nature who will donate. Ladies and gentlemen... ...the most generous guest of the night will be honored with a plaquette. Now it's yourturn. - 10.000. - 10.000 TL from Mr. Faruk Baykara. Write down 15.000 on me, sister. I guess the highest donation is 21.000 TL. What a charitable, patriotic person you are. Have some, you will like it. Thank you. But dessert is not really my thing. Then you try it, my hero. Thank you, I have already tasted. - Hello, my name is Gzde Akbayrak. - Ali Tanriverdi. It's a pleasure. Let me congratulate you. But why didn't you get your plaquette on stage? We could have a photograph taken together. And you did not give any interview. I don't donate forfame. Besides I think charity works should stay as a secret. Rememberthe saying "a hand should not see what the other hand gives". What sector do you work in? Fire. - Fire? - Fire. I mean, we produce helicopters which put wildfires out. - Interesting. - Yes, it is. Our latest model has the capacity of putting 3 burning trees out in 1second. We usually work in summer. You know, the season of fire. - Let me congratulate you one more time. - Thanks. I have to confess though... ...I have made some mistakes as well at nature's cost. But now, I feel like my soul purifies itself as I watch my grandfather's... ...forest gets bigger and bigger. - Forest? - Yes, ourfamily owns a memorial forest. - Near Polonezky. - That's great! I visit there once a week to escape the... ...mayhem ofmodern life. The smell of pine trees... ...singing birds, that light breeze... You should see it. It's like a Garden of Eden. You should see it. Would you like to see it? Boo! What's this son? 21,000 TL! Did you pay 21,000 TL for a simple plaquette? Hseyin sells one of these just for 5 TL. What should I do? The girl is rich. Some faggot donated 20,000 TL, so I could not just stand there. But, the good news is bird is in the cage. So all you needed was just one night, my boy. So you got the girl, well done. I am his master, that's why. I told her we have a memorial forest in Polonezky. What forest, son? Everything is under control, father. No need to worry. Dursun, you should get a big signboard done. Write down my grandfather's name at the top and "Memorial Forest" underthat. OK, the name at the top and memorial forest underthat. Ok, I am leaving, I am going to change. Nuri! Set up a swing under one of the trees. - Consider it done. - Have a good day. C'mon boys, time for raising money. Here we are. "Dursun Tanriverdu Memorial Forest". Are you from Eastern Black Sea region? My late grandfather... ...was a very playful man. It is as beautiful as you told. A forest is the best thing to leave behind. I wish everybody would think that way. Sometimes I don't understand people. They only think of making more and more money. They are so blind that they could destroy this beauty in cold blood. When my grandpa brought me here forthe first time... ...all these trees were so little. They grew up with me. I have witnessed this miracle. While my friends were having fun in an amusement park... ...I was looking forward to come here with my grandpa. There is something I'd like to show you. Here we are. This is one of the greatest childhood memories ofmine. A swing. Has it been here all these years? Ali, this is made of oak tree. Do you know that lightning mostly fall on oak trees? Of course, I know. Lightning mostly fall on oak trees. Chestnut, beech, acorn... ...underneath leaves... - Above clouds. Do you know the song? Of course I know... - I was singing that song when I was here. - Sing it, then. - Now? - Yes. OK. Chestnut, beech, acorn. Underneath leave, above clouds. That would be enough forme, you have a great voice. Just name it. I can make a best of album of ourfavorite childhood songs. Slowly. Shit! I told you to come earlier, didn't I? We are on time, they are the early ones. That's what I'm saying. We should have come earlier. What are you, a moron? Don't you hearme? We did not come early enough, but they did. Just shut up, use your brain. Hey you, son of a Laz, you made me stressed. Stop talking, keep on holding. Let's make a toast for a green world. Do you work with yourfather? No. My father sells pant... Penthouses. Does yourfamily live in Istanbul? Yes, in Mahmutpaa. I mean, in Saryer. Mahmutpaa Mansion in Saryer. We have been living there for 3 generations. What about yourfamily? My father is in construction sector. My mother died when I was 5, in a traffic accident. I am very sorry... ...for your loss. - Thanks. - A special one? - Used to be. Once upon a time. But recently I figured out that she was not any different than others. It is a cliche, but I am looking fortrue love. I know what you are talking about. They say "The rich is born lucky". Maybe that's why we start our lives one step back. Let's make a toast for people who think money is not everything. You are a butterfly, you know? What? - Butterfly? - Me? - Yes. - What do you mean? You are kind, beautiful, colourful. If you hold too tight a butterfly it dies... ...and when you give a loose it flees. That's why you are like a butterfly. Really? I assume I have heard these before. Me? Hell no! I have just made it up. Interesting. I have read all books of Krat Yaar. That's where I know. Come on, is it exactly the same? - Yes. - Great minds... ...think alike. But, Gzde, you are the most beautiful woman... ...I've evermet. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Very well, thank you. And you? Fine, thanks. I am the designer of the new landlord, Mr. Erdoan. My name is Berkcan Akta. Here is my card. We need to take some measurements? Can we do it now? It depends how you take it. Take it, girl. What do you do exactly? I am the guy who brought mannequin business to this country. My workshop is upstairs. I make the best of them. - So you are an artist. - Yes, I am. I have a spirit of artist, myself. What is your source of inspiration? From hips, ass... ...kind of. Very well. If you finished, we should leave. He came out to be Gandalf. - Bonappetit, miss. - Thanks. What are doing today? I reserved the day formyself. I will pay a visit to a friend. - Bon appetite sir. - Welcome Bilal. - Thank you. How are you, Ms. Gzde? - Fine, thanks. I am great! You deserve better, but I did not want to come here empty-handed. You look great, Mr. Erdoan. You are full of energy at that age. Thanks, Bilal. If you excuse me, father. Ms. Gozde, you forgot the flowers. I like them uncut where they are, Mr. Bilal. How it is going? Are they clearing the shops? I was there before I came here, sir. I did not see any changes. - Time for plan B. - Yes, sir. I am scared of darkness. Son of a gun! - Please someone bring a light. - What is that? - Hello. - Hello. Hello. My name is Berkcan. I am Suleyman. Mr. Sleyman, can I take this? I have a darkness phobia. You are the best thing that I came across today. Black diamond. Are you speak Turkish? Can't you see that we are Turkish? How should I know? She looks more Slavish to me. Look, sir. We are working for Mr. Erdoan and we own here now. Go and work, then. We are supposed to take measurements. Don't intervene. Go and take it. What kind of a place is this? Su can stay here. - You will see what I will do to you. - Miss! Arab, it is all because of you. Fellas, do not feel depressed just because we have no electricity. We will take this issue in hand as the board ofmanagement. We will provide a generator... ...and distribute spotlights to each and every shop. We will get justice as we deserve. The struggle is going on. What's that? What could you possibly eat that cost 500 TL? Fuck! Not this nonsense again, father! You should not have got me involved in this. She has millions, what should we eat, a sandwich? Exactly. Ali, as far as I see... ...this girl is not an easy touch, she is a special person. You should go to take away food shops and then suddenly her life... ...becomes more colourful. Mingling freely with the crowd will warm her heart. For people like them, those places are not lousy, but authentic. Well said Uncle Miran! May God give you a long life. This is not enough, Uncle Miran. Maybe it is all right forthe beginning. But you cannot steal... ...her heart with this stuff. Ali look, you need an unusual event for attracting her. - What are you saying? - Now, look. A victim who needs help... ...and a hero who saves him. Principal, what do you think about this idea? I cannot say this is not possible. Because there is no such thing as impossible. So, it is possible. - Do you understand what I mean? - You are absolutely right, principal. What a cozy place, Gzde! Everything is so spontaneous. People are warm or so. There is no need to pretend in a place like this. It really is. I feel like a little girl again. It feels so good to get away from all that dullness and insincerity. Thank you. Not at all. I knew you would like it, but it is so much betterto hear it from you. Help! Help! - The guy fell into water! - Somebody help him! He will be drowned! What's going on? Ali? What a brave young man! Bravo! Did you see how brave he was? You are very lucky to have him, miss. Ali, I do not know how to swim. Then, why did you throw yourself into water? Dursun told me that you would save me. Don't worry, he will save him. What are you saying? They will both get drowned. - Don't worry, he will save him. - Another guy jumped as well. If you don't know how to swim, why did you jump that far like an idiot? Bless you. If not forthat kid, you would get us killed! And I made a fool of myself in front of her! Please, don't get mad. The currents took me away. The currents should take you away for ever. - Principal, what do we do now? - How should I know? Ismail, no hard feelings, but this is not the way to do it. So enlighten us, Atilla. To begin with, our plan should be wise and result oriented. - What do you mean? - Tahtakale, Mahmutpaa, the Grand Bazaar... Today I will show you the real stanbul. But I go shopping there all the time. How do I look? Anything suits to a beautiful lady. Thank you. I am not sure about the colorthough. I don't understand some people. They lock themselves up to shopping malls... ...instead of walking around the streets. So you don't go to shopping malls? Nothing to attract me there. Everything is the same. Girls, outfits, accessories. Look at this place, how dynamic and colourful. Very nice. Yeah, it really is colourful. There are all kinds of people. Hey you, stop! Asshole! Why did you run so fast like Usain Bolt? What I should I do? Get lost now, I'll see you later in the market place. Put your hands up, lean against the wall. - What's going on? - Go get the Arab! - Sir, there is a misunderstanding. - Shut up! - Don't move! - What a chance! You will see your chance at the citation. Go get him! What is it, bro? We are fucked, Sleyman. What are you yelling at me? I did what you told me. Please listen to me, officer. I will not press charges against them. Please calm down, miss. Take a seat. I am calm. And my bag is here. There is no problem. There are some procedures. If they do not have any criminal record, no problem. All right then. Do you know them? Not the black one. But Ali is my... Your what? My... Do you work as a team? What are you up to? Are you laying a plot? No sir, it is not what you think. I swear. I have seen with my own eyes. You were sharing the booty. Sir, I am going to tell everything. But please, keep this between you and me. Are you fucking with me? Why the hell should I keep it as a secret? You misunderstood me, sir. Yes, there was a plot but not for purse snatching. The girl upstairs is my chick. All we wanted was showing off a little. Sleyman, works as a porter in ourmarket place. I have a shop there too. Whose son are you? Ismail, the principal. Which Ismail, the panties man? The one who used to be a boxer in national team? What kind of a man are you? You turned the city upside down... ...just for attracting some girl. - That's because of this idiot. - Shut up! Please sir, don't say anything to her. I said OK. No hard feelings, but that's all from me. What are you saying, Ali? We have tried so hard, why are you giving up now? What the hell are you talking about? Don't you understand? I have made a fool ofmyself. She has nothing to do with me after all these. Did you tell everything or what? Give me a break, Nafiz! I had to lick their boots just to save my skin. If that police officer did not recognize my father... ...they would arrest us on the charge of forming a gang. Don't waste my youth, fellas. That's all from me. I've warned you that, this pimp only lives for himself, haven't I? I know him so damn well. You traitor! May God mercy us. What will happen now, uncle Miran? Son, do you remember your circumcision feast? The market place had been just opened by that time. Everybody was in debt, flat broke. But we wanted you to remember those days as happy ones. So we all did our best and had your circumcision feast done... ...in the best place it could ever be. Then you started to school. Late Uncle Hac bought your first schoolbag. That Nafiz who never offers anyone even a tea bought... ...the most expensive school uniform for you. When you were in high school, one day you came here with blood all over yourface. You were beaten up by those who were running the parking lot. Kurt Cemal was about to get killed just... ...because you were hurt. The yearthat you failed the university exam... ...these people of the market place sent you to private teaching. And now are you turning your back on these people? Uncle Miran, I know all about these. But believe me, I was disgraced before her. Now, I am sure she thinks that I am a fool. I don't have my dignity anymore. Look what we got ourselves into! They winded me up and you did not stop them. I can not believe myself, either. I feel that there is no way out. Son, if it is about bread money, nothing else matters. You listen to me and don't give up yet. An advise from me. You either seem as you are or be as you seem. You are right, uncle. OK. You have heart of a lion. - You are kind of quiet today, Ali. - Sometimes I am. I think silence can be shared as well. What do think ofme, Gzde? Wait let me say. You think, I am a fool, right? Not at all. I think you are fun. Even now. - Really? - Yes. I know you are doing some things just to attract me. But you are a bit unlucky. - Look, do you see what he is doing? - Yes, I do. - You wait here. I'll be right back. - What are you doing? - Hello, bro. - Hello, bro. Listen man, I will go straight to the point. I will pay you 50 TL and these rabbits will be mine. What are you saying? I earn my bread money with them. Are they your workers or what? Maybe slave is the right word. You exploiter! Are you crazy? Piss off! Ali, please calm down. I don't want to hurt you, I give you 100 TL. Give me the rabbits. So you are humiliating me just to show off your girl. All right, pay me 500 TL and the rabbits are yours. OK. I pay you 500. I can not stand any kind of exploitation, that's it. I have neither been to a zoo norto a circus since my childhood. I'll make a nice packaging forthem. Looks betterthis way. Have a great day. Why did you do that? What a man. Look at them. They are so cute. Come to me. Has Mr. Ali saved you? Look how sweet they are. They really are. But they should be where they belong... ...not in some box. Gzde. Even if you have already heard all my words before... ...and I feel like a fool in front of you all the time... ...you are the most special person I have evermet. The kindest, the most beautiful, the most unapproachable. I love you. I love you, too. Love is like summer rain. You get wet, but never want it to stop. That's what love is. Where do you catch it? How does it capture you? Nobody knows. One day there you are, with a foolish smile on yourface. You are in love, my friend. Son of a Laz, what are you doing? - I am a gourmet now, principal. - What gourmet, man? Laz gourmet, principal. - Have a nice day, fellas. - Thanks. It is a long story, father. But guess what? I kissed her. I have forgotten all the words I memorized when I faced your beauty. I can only write down I love you. What is your job concern, Bilal? Isn't it your duty to kick those guys out of there? How many days have passed? Why didn't they evacuate the market place? Should we just pull the building down on their heads, or what? Go there now and do whatever you need to do. I want them to evacuate the building right away! It is my property. I don't want to see these cars here again! I am warning you too! If you ignore them I will sue you. Understood? Principal, those bastards are pulling our cars off. Please have a look, I'll be right back. What is going on here? Wait a minute. You are occupying a property which is owned... ...by someone else and use illegal transportation. - Who do you think you are? - And who the hell are you? Calm down! Do you have any idea how many people make a living from here? It is non ofmy business. I am just doing my job. You either evacuate your shops peacefully or... Or what? What are you saying, punk? Or we will pull this building down on your head and lay the foundation upon you! Uncle, Miran! You will not manage to evacuate us! Uncle, Miran! Uncle, Miran! Jesus saved you, Uncle Miran! Are you all right, now? I am all right, son. Thank God I cheated the death again. You don't take care of yourself at all, uncle. Every night... Nevermind me. How are things going with her? Uncle Miran, actually I intended to talk to you about that... ...but this is not the right place. You fell in love with her, didn't you? I figured out this the moment I saw your eyes, when you said you had kissed her. There are not any old romantics left here, son. The best thing to do is to forget about her. It is an impossible love. If it is possible, then it is no love. If I tell her everything, she will leave me and never want to see me again. Then what happens to the tenants of the market place? I will be discharged tomorrow. You bring me the lady. Principal... ...we couldn't send out any parcels since morning. The authorities do not let transportation vehicles... ...parked in front of the market place. - Tell everyone to come to the roof! - Aye, sir! What are you doing in the middle of the road? Don't you see? I am painting. All right, but why in the middle of the road? Art is made for people, officer. This painting was made by a Spanish artist called Goya. And I will do the same fucking thing in the middle of the road. - Enjoy it! - Thanks. Where are we going, love? I am dying to know. I will introduce you to a very special person. What is this place, Ali? Are you going to tell me? Be more patient. - This is Uncle, Miran. - Welcome, Gzde. - Thank you. - C'mon in. - Hi, uncle. - My dearest. You have prepared... ...a perfect dinner as usual. Gzde, you deserve better, but... Please don't say that Uncle Miran. They all look delicious. I wanted to play you music but this antique does not sound again. You have just discharged from hospital, uncle. You had better not to drink raki. People who drink only water are immortal, son? My late grandfather Kevork drank this till he was 92 years old. I am still young, no need to worry. How old are you, Uncle Miran? My soul is 18, my body is 40, my id card is 64 years old. Let's drink to the ones who won't come back, to bright future... ...and to your health, kids. We were able to see the sun set today. Let's hope the same fortomorrow. Uncle Miran, why are you staring? They say that if one is staring there will be... ...either a visitor or a shooting star. They say shooting starmeans sky... ...throws a stone to his lover's window. Who do these words belong to? I swear I found this on internet. Kids, excuse me for a minute. I'll be right back. Where are you going, uncle? - How is he? - So sweet. I haven't played this for a long time but if you don't mind... I would like to play it in honor of this wonderful evening. We would love to listen. - Thank you, uncle. - Thanks for listening, kids. What we need is a Turkish coffee afterthis song. Let me do that, you stay. - Things you will need are in the kitchen. - OK. Son, this girl really loves you... ...and she doesn't behave as she is a tycoon's daughter at all. You are right, uncle. But I have told so many lies to her. What am I supposed to do now? After I save the market place... ...the best thing to do is going away with my love in my heart. Do you think it is so easy? Listen to me carefully. You find true love just once in your life. I did, too. Sultan. I was Armenian and she was Turkish. I did not admit herthat I was Armenian. I was sure that herfamily would not let us get married. Then I couldn't continue lying to her... ...ran away with her love in my heart. But what I think now is that... ...I wish I would be braver and fight formy love. If I did that, we would have spent all those years together. Listen to me carefully, just tell her everything and see what happens next. Here are the coffees. - Thanks a lot. - Bonappetit. Thanks. Gzde... I have some things to confess. - For instance... - "Dursun Tanriverdu Memorial Forest" I figured out the minute I saw it. Gzde, don't tease me. I am trying to confess some things. All right, I am listening. Rememberthe guy about to drawn in the sea? The one you couldn't save? Just give me a break, Gzde. I am trying to explain something. But you don't need to do that. I am smart enough to... ...understand that you have organized tricks to impress me. - But Gzde... - Look... I don't want to ruin this beautiful moment by talking about this. I trust you. After all what you have done were so much fun. Gzde, you are really unbelievable. And now I have a surprise for you. - Nuri! - Have you seen the newspaper? Look at Ali. Have you seen the newspaper? Aren't we talking about the same thing? I wander if Principal has seen it already? - Let's go and visit principal. - This guy will make me crazy. What did I say now? Principal. - Have you read the papers? - Ali has become famous. He is, he finally is. And we are so fucked up. What can go wrong? Don't you understand? Our plot will come out. - Yes, ma'am? - Do you know where Akbayrak's mansion is? I knowma'am. It is in Zekeriyaky. Take me there, now! You piece of shit, I will make this world hell for you! - I beg your pardon, ma'am? - You concentrate on driving. Can I help you? - Daddy... - Tell me. - I want to tell you something. - Tell me, honey. - What is going on? Who are you? - I apologize. I could not stop her. Look at the paper. Look! Is Gzde Akbayrak Getting Married? What is it to you? Look, this dick, Ali has fooled me just as he fooled you. He was supposed to be on a business trip... ...but apparently he was here making out with you. What the hell is she talking about? He fooled you with his old tricks, didn't he? What a pity! I was herfiance, what about you? Have a sit. Now tell me, who is this guy? Where does he live, what does he do for a living? Who do you think you are, you little brat? Do you really think I raised herfor a grabber like you? It is a miracle how she ended up as a dishonest man like you is around her. Mind your language when you talk to Mr. Erdogan! Otherwise I'll cut your tongue off and give it to dogs. Sugar boy. Come to Mahmutpaa and we play backgammon. - Kill the bastard! - Wait! I have seen so many dogs barking like you, but I finished them all off! That's why I am up here and you are there. And I have seen so many guys talking big before swallowing their words. You can not even come nearme without your dogs and having me tied. Break his all bones and throw him to his father's trash... ...so that they see who they are dealing with. - Ali! - Bastards! This is the best for a 16 year old. We have all the colours. - Principal, Ali is... - What happened to Ali? Ali! My son! Who did this to you? Get him water. OK, don't try to talk. Shall we take him inside? Let's carry him in. My girl, it is my fault. I should have warned you. No. It is my fault, father. I believe everyone so easily. These people could have fooled me as well. They are like a real gang. What gang, father? What are you talking about? Listen. I bought a market place in Mahmutpaa last month. I am going to turn the building into a shopping mall. That piece of shit... - What is his name, again? - Ali. He is son of one of the shopkeepers there. Those morons expected him to charm you to change my mind. That's how these people are, Gzde. Even if they talk about honesty and morality... ...they are the ones who act in the most dishonest way. Listen, my girl... ...after you lost yourmother I pampered you in every way I could. I did whatever you wished for, just to keep you happy. But that wasn't the right way to do. From now on you will do whatever I say. You are going to get married with Bilal as soon as possible. - What! - You will do as I say! You will get married with Bilal. I want to talk to Mr. Erdoan. Do you have an appointment? Tell him that Ali's father smail is here, he would understand. OK sir. Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Ismail wants to see you. Ali's father. Ali's father. Yes, sir. You may go in. Great businessman, charitable... ...multi billionaire Mr. Erdoan Akbayrak. How could you have a young man beaten up like that? You ruthless! He made a mistake and learned his lesson. It's that simple. If you go too far, I will finish you off, as well. Listen Erdoan, we have been living in honesty for all our lives. We tried to cheat just once, but we messed it up. We did not kill or steal... ...just involved ourselves in a childish deception. It was not for earning more and more money like you do... ...but not to lose what we already have. If we wanted, we could kidnap your daughter and threaten you. But that's what we are. Even ourmistake is in respect of love. Are you done? One more thing. You won't be able to throw us out from that place! We'll see about that, smail! We'll see who will win. When yourmother was feeding when you were a baby... ...you would cry till she gave you the next spoon. That's why yourmother and I had to feed you together... ...at the same time with spoon in our hands. Father, what happened to your hand? Nothing. I've fixed out something. - That's enough father, I am full. - No. One more. - I swear I going to throw out. - This is the last one. Stop it father or I am going to throw out. Dearest Gzde... Yourfather has bought our market place a while ago. He wants to tearthe place down where hundreds of people earn their bread money. We could not let this happen. Then we dared to do something we have never done in our lives before. Cheating. When we saw your picture in the newspaper we decided to carry out this dirty trick. How could we know that you will turn out to be a wonderful person... ...who doesn't match with herfather. Apart from you, we needed another victim, Ali. Maybe you are not going to forgive us forthe rest of your life... ...but Ali loves you so much, my girl. Do not lose each other! I wanted to write this letter... ...as I am going to die alone just because... ...I couldn't tell the truth 50 years ago. I have never spent a moment without thinking about her... ...and I have learned just one thing in this mortal world... ...love comes with no sign, but leaves with a sign. Don't let it go away, my beautiful girl. C'mon in Gzde. Sorry about that... ...this place is not comfortable enough for you. Are you alright, Uncle Miran? Yes, I am alright. - Shall I bring you water? - No, I am OK. Gzde, my girl, can I ask a small favor? Of course, Uncle Miran. The market place is about to be lost. And I have one foot on the grave. If something happens to me, would you take care ofmy bird, Kevork? I don't want to hear you talking about this kind of things ever again. And I will take care of Kevork when ever you wish me to do. - Have a good night. - Thanks, you too. Uncle Miran! He is still sleeping. Uncle Miran, breakfast is ready! Uncle Miran! No! Uncle Miran used to say... "No matter what colour of our eyes are, the colour of ourtears are the same." I didn't understand what he meant by then. But I understand him now. But life is really short. I don't want to delay anything from now on. I know this is not the right time and place but... ...Gzde... ...would you marry me? Yes. Time is up. Is everything ready? Gzde, what are you doing with these worthless people? Shut up, you faggot. I am not talking to you, I am talking to Gzde! Bilal, watch your words, OK. I am on the side of these so called worthless people... Go and tell my father, you won't able to tear down this place. That's my girl! What are you doing here, Gzde? Get in the car right now! I'll stay here, father. What are you talking about? What are you among these worthless people? Watch your words, you thief! My girl, they must have fooled you. Get in this car, stop this nonsense. No, I won't, father. I am going to stay here with Ali. Do you want to stay here and starve to death? How could you forget the days you were sleeping on benches? That you were eating dry bread, sleeping hungry? Now you are trying to destroy these honest people. I can not let this happen. I am going to stay here with the man I love. Father, you can live without this place... ...but these people can not. Start the operation! Start the operation! Stop! Stop! Abdullah, hold it tight! Can't you se it is lopsided. Have you given away your brain? What are you doing, son? C'mon, you wear it. Let's see if you will be handsome with it too. Look at me. Let's see what will come out from here? A pony came out. - What is that? - Horse. - A horse. What's his name? - Pony. Hi. Hi, welcome. It is very unusual to see a very nice shop like this one here in Mahmutpaa. Thanks. By the way everything here is organic. How much is this baby? Would it be OK for 10? OK. - 5 TL without a receipt? - OK. Thanks. - Here. - Thanks. Gzde, no offence... ...you are a perfect person but don't know anything about this business. Don't disturb. Baki, Abdullah! Come and give me a hand. Look, who are here. - Who is here son? - Grandpa. - Grandpa. - Grandpa. Bravo. Look what grandpa bought for you! Your grandpa has bought it for you. He has bought it forme. It is mine. I am going to ride it. Ali, don't make your son upset. Let's go. We will ride it in turns, then. I used to love her very much. I used to cry with her, laugh with her. My one and only love, Mualla. I am Turkish, she is Turkish. I was poor, she was poor. But still her family didn't let us get married. I am still in love with her but how can I find her? I swear I found a way. Facebook. I look for her in that site. How many people with the same name can be there? What was Mualla's surname? Bro, can I cash the tokens? - I have already paid you. - Last month. That's right, next month you can get this month's pay. But then I can't get previous month's pay. Don't get me confused. Let me check my notes. Where were you born, Nafiz? Don't you know that it is Kayseri. I have already collected some money. If you'd like I can give them to you. What are you saying? It's nice to hear it. Are you serious? "It's nice to hear it" I wish you a fruitful business by heart. What are you doing up there. Come here and help him. I am leaving it here. Atilla, isn't this bra small forthese tits? - Do you know the saying? - What is it? Balconies look better with flowers, woman look better with big tits. You are a great man. Have a fruitful business. Didn't I tell you that one day you would see the sun. I have a surprise for you Sleyman. I have bought that mansion I've mentioned you in Kenya. We will have antelopes in our garden. Can I take him for a minute? I want to show it to you on the net. Follow me my love. Tell me the truth. Have you ever eaten a human being? He even has seen the sun. What I am going to see? Have you become a Metal, son of a Laz? Our appearances may change but mind should be the same. The weakest link of Akbayrak family. In the old days I was just paying for her charity work. Now she has a shop. The rent, the taxes, the insurance... You have finished me off, my girl.
