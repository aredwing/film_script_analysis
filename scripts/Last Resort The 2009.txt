What did you do to her done, asshole? Do you hear it? Whatever I wanted. That's the point, right? You, Devil. Ya, well, this is it, guys! Let's get ready to party, bitches. Wow, we are so close to the beach. This is really nice. Open up. We are here. Welcome, my dear Kat... ..your bachelor paradise, Mexico style. I can't believe you guys did all this for me. - Well, thanks Sophia. None of this would have happened without her. - That is not true. Amber found the house and Beth... - Stop it! You're the best friend in the whole world... ..and we know it all. - Ok, ok, enough. Ok..ok, can we quit stalling? Let's go. Packed light as usual? - Hey, be nice to me. This is my week. Hello, handsome. Oh, my God! Look at this... Thought you were bringing the decorations from home? Margarita's, everyone? - Oh, oh, make mine a double - Or a triple. - Alrite, easy there, vodka. The sugar in these things you will give you a wicked hangover. And don't even get me started on the empty calories. I will have mine straight. Pin the penis on a Mexican dude? Sweet! Can we play now? I'm gonna call my parents, tell we got here, ok? - Oh, come on, Beth. I'm sure, you go one night... ..without calling your parents before checking-in. Now, have a drink... ..and go pin that cock on the wall. I need you all to promise me that even if I try to turn my phone on... ..you will rip it out off my hand and throw it in the ocean. - Ok, enough talk. Can we decide the first part of the night, already? - Not until we have put these on. I am the bride. You do realize that I would never wear that, right? - Come on, Jess! We'll will, it will be fun. - Fine! Never again after this weekend, okay? Oh, oh..wait! You can't forget these. Oh, my God! You are getting laid, if you like it or not. Oh, come on! - I will take it. My penises are stuck! Alright, ladies! Let's do this. Try to keep with me, girls. I'm drinking until dawn. She lost 15 pounds after the break-up. And after which she started drink phase. - Did you tried to talk to her? - Maybe, I do not know. When I did it she just kinda changed the subject... ..and totally defensing herself. Oh, this is beautiful? Is it me? Let me see. No! Here! The bar is right here. Quit stalling. - I just want something to memorize the trip... ..you know, something I don't get in New York. - But you can get that exact same bracelet on Canal Street. - Since when you have been in Canal Street? Like it? For you, $ 10. Thank you. Do you take American? - Thank you. Yes. You seem like a very nice girl. Very clever. May I read your palm? I will predict the future. I think, she wants to read your palm. You have a very strong love line. You're very passionate, right? Men loves your type... You meet a sudden... Let go! - What did she say? I see a dark road infront of you. If you don't listen, death will devour you! Ya, that was a kinda freaky. - Oh, come on! Who cares what she said? We are wasting valuable drinking time. Let's go! Without speaking a word, ..get a guy to buy you a drink. - Oh, that was mine. Can you get me a man's version of this game? I can't even keep up with this version! - Oh, you're doing just fine. Oh, great! Here we go. She is awesome. You're! Now, please don't encourage her. Did she just suck it out of his pants? Got something a little more challenging? - Yeah! Try not being such a cocktease! - Whatever! May be you should being a cocktease. Guys, I think those guys are looking over here! I think, those guys are coming over here. Good evening ladies. I'm Jeremy... Jeremy Spencer, guy with two first names. This here is my best friend in the whole wide crazy world! - Rob Aimsley. Mind, if I sit down? Please, please, please tell me... ..that you're not Kathleen. - No, I'm Beth. I'm Kathleen. - It's a pleasure, treasure! Hi, I'm Jessica. - Hi. So, where you all come from? - New York, Boston, Providence. - Wow, worldly. We are from Texas. - I went to Dallas for a real estate convention last fall... ..lots of cowboy hats. - Really? That's cool. - We're from Austin, so it's not really that many cowboys. But..but we could be cowboys if you want us to be! If you are not cowboys, what do you do? - We work in television. Rob, here is a producer. He's the big boss man. - Not really the boss. - Come on, dude, don't be modest. So what brings you two, down here? - We are celebrating. Rob, here, just got a huge promotion too! - Congratulations! Then you can buy us all a shot! - Perfect! - Ok. So, what will it take you to kiss me? Look, I really like you... I just.. Just, you know... I'm not gonna sleep with you! - Wow! You don't beat around the bush, do you? Mind, if I? - It's just that I like... ..don't do that, ever. - Alright. Are you into somebody else... ..or you just playing it hard to get, what? - It's just not gonna happen. - What's the deal then? What's going on here? What are we doing? - The deal is, I gonna go dance with my girlfriends. And if you're lucky to hook-on, I suggest that drunk girl over there, who's falling out of her cute top. Hi. What do you think of the goof-up? I'm not sure why, but I think I kinda like him. We knewed it! I mean.. I mean we knew better! I think, we actually considering going home with him! - Oh, no, no! Not our Betty-Wetty. - Well, a part of me kinda wants to. - What? No way! - Are you serious? Is hell's freezing over or something? Just boys! Hey, you guys, stop! Come on, let's go... So, what's it like working in television? - You know, it's... I don't... - really produce TV shows? - Ya, I'm sorry! Really! Jeremy convinced me that would be a good idea... - to help you score with the ladies! - I need all the help I can get. What you really do? - Tenth-grade English teacher. - Really? You know... I had this huge crush on my tenth-grade English teacher. Look! Look what I got. - Where did you get? - I guess, from him? - You're smart. He is smart. Sorry. About that crush? You know, it all happened on a field trip to the beach. - I'm sure, we can find a beach somewhere. - Oh, really? - Mind, take a walk? Ya, Give me one second Hey! - Here you go! Hey, how it's going with the boss man? - So far good. Sophia and the boss man sitting on a tree... F-U-C-K! Oh, my God! You should totally go fuck his brains out! Because what stays in Mexico, happens in Mexico, right? Wait, wait! Do you mind if I leave with him? - Oh, go! One of us should get laid tonight! - You know, are you sure? This is your week... - Go, go, do it. Knock yourself out! I'll meet you in time for breakfast. Bye guys! Okay, bye! - Bye. That was awesome. So, how do you feel about tutoring me... ..somewhere more private? I think we need to go. - Already? I only had a few drinks. - We know! Come on! No need to use up all that fun in the first night. Sorry, champ! Dance is over. - Ya, says who? - We're going home. I guess, I have to go now. What the fuck is your problem? - She's getting married next week, asshole. I'm getting piece of that ass, tonight. So back off, bitch! Damn it! That was awesome! - That was not funny. I shouldn't have done that. - That was hilarious. You know, every time we go out, one of you gets in trouble. - So, you kick someone in the balls? It's sweet. It's like a tradition. I wish, just once we can go out... ..and have nice, calm, quiet evening. - Ok, that would be an awesome bachelor party! Alrite..alrite! Can we just go back to the house, please? Give me a cock to pin on the wall already. Hello? - Oh, finally! - What, she answered this time? Oh, God..so sorry, Beth. I'm fine. We thank her for ruining my week! - She sounds really pissed? - She's hangover. Don't worry about it. I be there..in 15 minutes. - We are not at the house. We met these tour guides... ..down by the beach and we're going sightseeing. - Okay, I'll meet you there. Beth! Are you abandoning me too? Let's go. - I'm sorry. We can't wait. You know, how she gets. But we'll see you at the house before dinner. - Promise! Have fun. And be careful! - We will. Bye. Thank you. What's going on? - My friends ditched for the afternoon. Mind, if we have some lunch? - Morning quickie, first? Quick enough for you? - Maybe a little too quick. I'm gonna go shower. - Great! I just need one too. Hair of the dog? - No. That's why you should never drink on an empty stomach. This tour's kinda sucks. - I don't it's the tour. I think it's just a shitty looking country. Hey, can you take us back down by the beach or something? Aren't there some cool landmarks or...? - Yes, yes..yes! We'll take you to a beautiful spot... ..very beautiful, just like you, right? I think he likes you. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. Fuck you. - Fuck you. What's your problem? - I don't have a problem. - You're such a bitch! Let's do it now, man. I would not get too close. - You think, we're far enough? - It is good Let's do it now. Thanks for the tacos. It's a great restaurant. Really wish, if you'd let me pay. - Why is that? Isn't this technically our first date? I would say, the Bar was our first date. Last night would be our second date. That makes this... - Our third. You know, that means... Your place or mine? - Mine is closer. So I walk in... ..and this guy is on Kathleen's bed... ...and he's naked and tied up. And this is the best part! He's crying... ...blubbering like a baby. He said I was mean to me. So you just left him there? You never told me that. That is so funny. Why... Why are we stopping? - Because this is your stop, whore. Get out of the van. Get out. Kathleen! No! Get off me! Get off! Pick up. Pick up. Hi, Beth. - Sophia, they shot Kat. I don't know where we are. - What? Where are you? He drove us into a desert. There's a palm tree and... Oh, my God! He's coming. Beth? Throw the phone! Throw the fucking phone! Oh, shit. Please, my friend just called. She sounded like she was in trouble... I think something might have happened. - Is she missing? - Yes, She is missing. And she said a friend of mine was shot. - Seorita, you're gonna have to calm down. I cannot help you, if you do not calm down. - Alrite..alrite. I'm sorry. Now, how long have been your friend's been missing? - They left about four hours ago, I think. - They only been gone four hours? Is this some kind of joke? - No, no! She said she saw a building... ..and some palm trees and a bell tower or some sort of... He hung up on me. - What? The Police just hung upon me. Fucking Mexico! All I want was a fucking help and... Where is the American Embassy? They will do something. - There is no embassy here. You must call Mexico City yourself. I don't think that can do much here. It's only been a few hours. Maybe they're playing a joke on you. - A joke? Why would they do that? - May be they're getting with you for going off with me. You said Kathleen was really pissed. - Kathleen would never do.. Ok, maybe Kathleen would do... ..but Beth would never go along with it. Let's....let's ask around. Maybe someone saw them at the beach. - Ok. Ya, I can show some pictures. How's your Spanish? They will not fight. Shut her up. Who the fuck did you call, your little girl, huh? Doesn't matter now, does it? Give us your money and jewellery. Give us your money and jewellery. Cellphones too. - I don't have mine with me. Check it. No, no, please. You're lucky, you're just a bag of bones... ..not even worth for raping. Your ring. Give me your ring. - He wants your ring. Just give it to him. But it's my engagement ring. Grab it. No! Please, don't do this! Bye, bitches. Watch out for coyotes, huh? Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop the car. You can't just leave us here. What we gonna do now? Get over here and help me. Keep the pressure on it, okay? My ring. Priorities? You been fucking shot! Those fucking bastards... If I ever see them again, I'll kill them. Is it bad? - She's shot. That's not good. Am I gonna die? - No, you're not gonna die. What are you doing? What are you doing? - Making a tranquil. We gotta stop the bleeding. Ok. Alrite! Lift..lift. I'm gonna die..I die.. I'm gonna die. - Shut up! I told you, your not gonna die. - So you yell at me. Do you know which way town is? - I don't know! I don't know! I'm all turned around... Sophia will call help. - So we just sit and wait? How she's gonna know where we are? Over there, I got a mirage. - No, no it's not too. What you think it is? - I don't know! It..It looks like a building. May be..may be there's someone there who can help. Can you stand? - No. I'll help you. I'll help you. I told Sophia about it. I told her, I saw it. Come on, easy..easy! You can. For fuck's sake, man. You know what fuck time it is? - It is 6:30.p.m, Jim. - What? Really? Sorry. Are you still drunk? Just a little hungover that's all. I mean, it got a little crazy after you left with a... Sophia. - Hi. Right! Hi again. How's Beth? We were hoping, you could help us out with something. Look dude, I'm not crossing swords with you... So if we're taking turns... - You speak Spanish, right? We need you talk to the town people.. Town's folks. Because we think her friends might been kidnapped... ..and we can't speak to them... - Bye! - No, please. What is this place? - It could be..or may be.. some kind of Army camp? Who cares? Let's get out of this fucking heat. We sould see if someone's home. We can get out of the sun a bit... ..and prop Kat's leg up. Hello? It looks deserted. I don't like the way this place looks. - Where else we gonna go? Let's get Kat inside. Here, here. Put her down here. Fuck! Keep relaxing. Keep it elevated. Ok, looks-like it's starting to clot, which is good. Try not to move or you'll break it open again, ok? Tough it up for me right row. Can you do that? God! Why is it happening to me? What kind of church is this anyway? Weird. It kinda looks-like they are hurting one another. I just don't understand. Why anyone would want to live out here... ..in the middle of nowhere! I found some candles and lanterns or something. We can use some to show our way back to town. We should stay the tonight. - What? Why? Once the sun goes down, we'll be able to see lights from town, right? - We don't even know where the town is. Didn't you take a look out there? There's nothing! We're in the middle of a fucking nowhere. - Let's risk it. I don't like it here. All I want is to get some place with a comfortable bed... ..where I feel safe. - Safe? This is the safest, we're gonna find. We can't carry Kat out in the dark. She's too weak and it's too dangerous. And..and I would't even know which direction to go. We don't know what comes out here at night! Coyotes, snakes..I.. I don't know. I don't wanna take that chance. You? So, now what? You, keep your leg up. Come on, we gather some supplies. You're not gonna leave me alone, are you? - I'll keep you company. - Good! Beth and I will see what we can find. Hopefully some bottle of water, blankets... Stuff to camp here for the night. Just promise me, you'll come back. - Trust me. We'll be back. Come on. These girls... Have you seen them? - Sorry, I have not seen them. Okay, he hasn't seen them here. Can we go get a drink, now? - Dude, give it a rest. I'll make it up to you. Ask him if he knows anything about a building in the desert... ..with the palm trees. Do you know of a building in the desert... ..with palm trees and a bell tower? - No, I don't know. - Thank you, sir. Dick. That's weird. Why did he get so freaked out? - Everybody down here is weird. That's why 'Mexico' means 'The Mexican'.. 'Weird!' Can we go get a drink, now? Fine. Let's keep asking. I still say, they're on a beach drinking somewhere... ..which is excatly, where we should be. Oh, my God! Fuck! No! No! No! No phones, no water! We still haven't found any food, just empty rooms. We should have never stopped here in the first place. - What should we have done? Drag Kathleen's bleeding ass to the desert until she's passed out? And then what? Sat in the dark while she died and wait for the coyotes to come? Would you have preferred that... ..you whiny, freaking, little bitch? - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll fucking kill you. Jess, what are you doing? - I'm sorry. I mean, we're all just stressed. That's what it is..I'm... Go back to Kathleen and Amber. - Shouldn't we stay together? - Look, I can take care of myself. But I'm not sure about Kathleen and Amber. I need you to go back and keep an eye on them. What you gonna do? - There's gotta be something here... ..water, first-aid..anything. We can try and follow the Sun tomorrow and... ..head west and may be find the coast. But we goona need supplies because... ..we're not gonna last without supplies. Just be careful. Not a very homey place, is it? Mind if I screws it up? I think, the candles are a nice touch. I saw this two-stored last month The previous owner loved. And I mean loved candlelight. He had these individual candlelevers... ..down the halls and up the stairs. It was really cute. The people I sold it to, just thought it was too to die for. But this place.. I just don't understand... ..who will build something so far out here... ..and then decorate them with x-rated artwork? It just doesn't make any sense. I mean, what did people use this place for? What do you think, Kat? Kathleen, are you okay? - I'll be a whole lot better, if you just shut the fuck up. You know, I talk when I'm nervous. The pond outside is cute though... ..with the trees running alongside it. There's landscaping there, atleast. Whoever used this place before... ..certainly wasn't a good decorator. I just can't imagine once, people just being out here... Jesus Christ! No wonder Ryan cheated on you... ..you stupid girl. - What do you mean? - I mean that men don't like it... ..when their girlfriends babble on and on about nothing! All they want is a pretty face... ..a nice ass and a place to keep their dick's warm. And the way you look,... ..a man can't help it. - Why did you say this? The tour guide didn't even want to rape you. Your tits have shrunk to nothing. - You selfish cunt! You think, you can just sit there and judge me... ..and treat everybody like shit? I don't know why Sophia always sticks up for you. I'm not gonna stay here, babysitting your sorry ass anymore. You can just sit there and bleed, for all I care. Where are you going? You can't just leave me alone. I would say 'Eat me'... ..but I know you don't, because you don't eat anything. - Go, fuck yourself. Awesome bachelor party, by the way. You're a great fucking friend. I can't believe, nobody seen them. Ok, that's over 20 drinks, you owe me! Would you rather give me the cash, I can put it into good use. A hooker, maybe. Why go you think it's so freaked out, when we ask about the bell? - I don't know! But we need to keep doing this? I mean, would you rather just go inside and party? It's her. Hey, where you going? You? Darkness is now very strong inside you. What did she say? - I don't know! Something about a shadow, I think. Ask her what she said last night. What have you told her last night? - I saw it in her hand. There is a very bad place in waiting for her and her friends... ..and, if they continue, death will come. What is it? What did she say? - Something about you and your friends dying in an evil place. - What? What place? The place with the bell? Which place? The place with the bell? With the palm trees? - Yes, yes! South of the border, at the old resort. An old resort, south of town. Resort? What kind of resort? Why does she think it's evil? Why is it.. why is it evil? It was long ago, but bad things happened here... ..and what comes in, will never get out. Where are you? Beth? Amber? Where are you? I need you. Jessica? Fucking Mexico. We should have gone to Vegas. Stupid cunts! Great! My party! Mine! Hello? Are you guys there? God, what's happening to me..? This community... ..was formed in hopes of finding a new world. With no rules, no boundaries, ..no social repercussion, ..and escape for those want to explore their deepest desires. A life that allowed us all to live... ..a life without fear! Fear of judement and ridicule. They came here to be who they always dreamed to be. Inhibitions have vanished in the wind. They shed their clothing! Uncontrollable sexual urges! Taking what you want, when you want! Moaning! Screams of ecstasy! The glorious pain behind every door. We devoured everything in sight. Food, drink..life itself! The power's overwhelming. It was inevitable. Death followed us all here... ..with the wind! And we cannot escape it's grasp! I cannot control any longer. Passions are too strong. My need for power over life itself... ..are just too strong. It whispers to me. They are those out there, who won't understand our paradise. They will never understand, the soul that have been revived. And those that have been damned to hell. It will never stop. I will never stop. Oh, God. Guys, are you here? Jess? Amber? Oh, it's you! Where the fuck have you been, huh? It's just a story. You know, I don't beleive in stuff like that, do you? - She certainly seem to believe it. That old bag has us completely fucked up. Go get some shots. And some nachos too. - Fine. - I'll come with you. What you need? - Those..three tequilas and... ..some nachos. Have you seen these girls? - No. Excuse me, ma'am. Everything good? - Ya! Get Jeremy his drink. Is that your friend? Oh, I'm sorry. I don't speak Spanish. Just let me go... - No, no, no. I speak English. I just thought that you might be... - I get that a lot. What did you show the bartender? My friends... ..they disappered! I'm wondering, if anyone can tell me, where they went... ...or who they went with. - No, I haven't seen them. Have you seen these women? - No. Sorry. - Thanks, anyway. You don't happen to know anyone, who'll take me south of town? - South of town? To where? - I heard of this resort. I think, they might be there. You're gonna have trouble finding anyone, who'll take you down there. - I know. I sort of heard. I guess, may be we could take you... ..for a small fee, of course. - Wait, you know where it is? You know how to get there? - Everyone around here knows where it is. They just don't go near it. So..so you go, tonight? - Oh, no! Not at night. Noone goes there at night. That place has a bad reputation, chica. We wait, until the Sun comes up. - No, I can pay you. What would it take to get you there, tonight? - Dangerous creatures come around here at night. Go home, take a shower. Relax. We meet here tomorrow morning. We go then, okay? - Ok. What did she say? - She thinks her friends are at the old resort... How do they know? - She didn't say. But I bet that bitch has called her... ..and said she was. Do you think they suspect us? - Does that matter? I'll take care of them tomorrow. Cheers. We don't even know these guys. How do we trust them? - I don't have a choice. - How much money do they want? It's a scam. Look, you guys don't have to come, if you don't want to. These are my friends. This is my problem. - No, no, of course, we're gonna go. We're not gonna just let you go out there alone. Right? - Why would I have to go? Right? You alright there? - Go, fuck yourself. So, when was the last time you saw your friends? - Two nights ago. I talked to them yesterday morning but... ..I haven't seen them since. That's too bad. Has anyone else seen them? - Just one American tourist, looks-like any other to the locals. We called the police. They don't even wanna be bothered. What she said about the police? - Don't worry! They won't help her with the search. They won't find them, even if they knew it. You do know, where you going, right? Oh, shit! Oh, God! Oh, God! - Oh, my God! Shit! You got to get me to a doctor. - Shut up, right! We don't have to do anything. You pulled a gun on us, remember? We ought to just leave you here. What do we do? Oh, God, what do we do? They chucked them out there.. Beth and everyone... ..and they robbed them. You were gonna kill us, just like you did to our friends, right? - Fuck you! We never saw your friends. Stop it! Stop it ok! Let me think. Alrite, We'll tie him up... ..and we'll make him take us to the resort. - No! Don't make me go there. Petty thief with gunshot will still get to make demands. Fuck! What the fuck did you do to them? - No, no, nothing..nothing. We took their money and stuff... But we left them on side of the road. We didn't kill him. Beth said you shot Kat. - I didn't mean to. She was trying to run away. What we do with him? - No doctor for you until, we find them. Take us to the resort. You're not actually going in there, are you? - Shut up! - You can't go in there... That place will make you do things... - Look! I'm not leaving without my friends. Get him out. - What? No, no! I brought you here... ..but I'm not going in there. Oh, come on! I need a doctor, man. There's no doctor until we find our friends. I'm not going in there. Please! - Fine! If you don't wanna come inside... You can stay here. Don't leave me here. Please, don't leave me. Come on! Don't leave me. Hello-o-o? After you! What's that? Anybody here? Anyone got a dune buggy? What if they aren't here? What if they're wandering out there, somewhere? How we gonna find them? - Just try not to think about it. They're around here somewhere. They gotta be. Beth? Amber? Jessica? Kathleen-n-n? You don't need to yell. I'm right here. - Oh, Kat! Oh, Kat! Thank God, you're okay. Beth said that you're shot. - Shot? I haven't been shot. I've never been better. Where are the others? - They're around here somewhere. We got a van. Let's get them and get back to town. You want to leave so soon? You should see the stars here at night. It's so peaceful. What's wrong, Kat? Why you're acting so strange? - I don't know what you mean! Oh, you want to go find the other girls. Ok, then. Follow me. Kat, what happened? When Beth called... Isn't this place wonderful? - Sure. How did you find it? - We were looking for help. And we found it. Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth. Give us this day our daily bread. And it helped us all so much. What are you talking about? - Go, find out! You lead. - If you insist! Wow! It can help all of you too. What is going on in there? Oh, shit! Sophie! Jeremy? We're here to get you home. - I don't wanna go home. We have to get the others and get you out of here. - The others? - Amber and Jessica! where are they? - I don't know. What's going on here? It's strange,Sophie.. I... - You, what? - I don't wanna tell you. Don't be afraid. You can tell me. Hey! Where did your other friend go? - What? Jesus! Kat...? Come on, we gotta go. - I'm not going anywhere. - We have to. It's not safe here. - I'm not going. Sophie, I don't know what's happening to me. Don't leave me alone. You know what? You guys, go find the others. I'll stay here with her. Just..just be careful.. out there. - We will. And keep her clothes on, ok? We'll be back soon. It's ok. Please! Please, I need a doctor. Listen! I'm ready! Are you? Amber? Jessica? Kathleen? No-o-o! - Jesus Christ! Eat. Amber, what are you doing? What have you done? What is this, shit? - No, that's my friend. Amber, it's me..Sophia. Listen to me. It's not.... Why don't you just listen. - No, no, stop. Stop! Pick up the furniture. She lost her mind. She let go. We all have. We all been set free. Jess, not you too! We got into trouble. We shouldn't have trusted them. But I fixed it! I took care of that fucker. Can't do much without this. Can you hear them? The voices in the wind? They're calling out for you! - I can't hear anything. They wanna know why you're afraid? Afraid to be free! Get the fuck out of here. Just..Just go to the van. And don't stop until you find help.
