York Hotel. [man 2] Yeah, copy that, Control. 10-4. York Hotel, as quick as you can. Thanks, sweetie. [upbeat rock song playing] Hey, Frank, how about a freebie? [laughing] [man] Thanks. [baby giggles] [truck horn honking] - [siren wailing] - [horns honking] [siren chirping] - Detective Crankovich. - [cop] Sorry, Detective...? Mankovich. Frank. Frank Mankovich. Detective. Don't let anybody through, especially the press. - Detective Hankovich. - [cops] Detective. Hey, we're part of the investigation. Detective Frank Wankovich. Detective Claire Lady. What happened here? I already told all your colleagues everything. Well, you can tell me again, then. Well, I was by reception and a man came in, and he was wearing a helmet and he had a gun with a silencer. Mm-hm. And then? Well, he pointed the gun at Mr. Ivanov and shouted something in Russian, I think. Then he shot him. - What did he look like? - [Perry] Bonneville. Superintendent. I'm not disturbing you, I hope, Bonneville? Oh. Not at all. Oh. Claire Maddox, Perry, head of homicide. - Hi. - Get out of here. Both of you. Right now. Or I'll slap you in custody. - Wait, you're not a detective? - No. My name is Frank, though. This wasn't all a lie. We had some good times, right? [chattering] - [man] Detective, a comment, please? - Okay, let them through. - Hey. What? What are you doing? - He said let them through. - You don't let anybody through. - Oh. Oh, I've gotta go, darling. - [Frank] Get me the control room. - They're on. - Hey. - [Mallard] So, you got a story, Frank? "Russian Mafia Wars." How's that sound? [Mallard] Okay. Let's do it now. Standing by. And you're on. At 8:45, Sergei Ivanov, a.k.a. Three Fingers, a figure in the Russian Mafia, left his room at the York Hotel. He'd just breakfasted on eggs, toast, and a black coffee. His last breakfast. The sumptuous lifestyle and escapades of Sergei Ivanov, mover and shaker in the nightclubs of Manhattan and New Jersey... Two minutes in the hotel and he comes out with a story. - A true artist. He's the best. - He's certainly the best at what he does. ...a war that has only just begun. This is Frank Bonneville, 365 News. That was great. - You need any help? - No, I'm fine. Won't be a minute. "Darling." - Who was that, then, your girlfriend? - I'm married. Ah. [chuckles] So, it's his wife. - [Finch] Yeah. - Eh! He's a player. - Aren't you, Finch? Huh? - [video game noises] - Chick in every port? - Nah. [Finch groans] [Claire] Oh. - [Claire] You okay? - [Finch] Yeah, fine. [Claire] You want a coffee? [Finch] Yeah, can I get a skim-milk latte? - [Claire] You on a diet? - [Finch] A bit, yeah. I had a medical, and apparently I'm 25 percent fat. - Is that bad? - Yeah. It's more than some snacks. [both chuckle] [Claire] Ooh! - Okay. - See you later. [chattering] There he is. Huh? Look at you. First reporter with the story, again. All other journalists banned from the site. Ha! Oh, no, wait. What are these? "Impersonating an officer." "Tampering with a crime scene." - I got results. - You're not Dirty Harry! At best, you're an underachiever at a local radio station. Often, a drunk underachiever. - Would you rather I didn't get the story? - Than break the law? Yeah. Why break the law? Plenty of news without having to break the law. If you run out, make up a story about a lost dog. I made up a story about being a detective. One more slip-up and you're fired. This is coming from upstairs, not from me. They've had it. They don't need this anymore. You're an arrogant, selfish hack who survives because everyone thinks you're a local celebrity. I can't fire you because I don't like you. But I can fire you if you break the law or for the next thing you do that breaks the rules. I so much as find out you used a disabled toilet, goodbye. - That's ridiculous. - Yeah, it's ridiculous. Go ahead, punk, make my day. [elevator bell dings] - Will there be any celebrities? - The girl who reads the weather - knows Al Roker. - Will he be here? No. She might, though. Hey, Sacha. This is my wife, Eleanor. - Oh, finally. Hi. - Hi. - [Finch] Many in? - Uh, no. No, you're the first. - Someone has to be. - [Eleanor] Exactly. And it's nice to be here in time to see the staff prepare for such a prestigious event. [Finch] See you later. Okay, let's get in. - Hi. - [woman] Hi. Hi. [chuckles] - Balloons. - It's still sunny out. Well, it's nearly July, isn't it? - Doesn't get dark till 9:00. - Imagine going out in the darkness. - You're the first here. - Yeah, he doesn't like to be late. - [bartender] Champagne? - [Finch] Don't mind if I do. There you go. Ah. Mm. So, what do you think of my little radio station event? Well, I mean, if it was really your radio station, it would be something. - Well, I'm chief sound engineer. - [soft music playing] And if you consider that radio is just sound, I'm sort of chief engineer, really. In one of the biggest local radio stations around. Locally. It's just not what I thought you'd still be doing at 50. - What do you mean? - Radio. - Radio is like... - It's what I love. Yeah, but it's just not very exciting. - You're joking. - No, I'm not joking. But go on, tell me. What is the most exciting thing that's happened this week? - Okay. Um... - Okay. - Well, you decide. - Okay. Is it that our omnibus podcast just made top 50 on iTunes? Ooh. Or, is it that Jamie Oliver popped in yesterday - to talk to Stig Arnold about fat kids? - Is he gonna be here? - Stig's never missed a party yet. Heh. - I meant Jamie Oliver. Who knows? - So, no, then? - No. Definitely not. - [sighs] - You meet Stig. You won't want to see Jamie Oliver after you've met Stig. [sighs] Sorry. [Eleanor sighs] Haven't you ever wanted to do something extraordinary? - [Mallard] Finch. - Hi. Um, this is Geoffrey Mallard, the radio boss. - This is my wife, Eleanor. - Pleasure to meet you. I've been looking for you. Some lunatic took his family hostage. He's armed. I need you and Claire to go and cover it. - Now? - Yeah, I don't have a choice. You're the only guy around. - Where is Claire? - She's on her way here. Nice to meet you. Okay, I'm so sorry, darling. No, no, no, you're not leaving me here. I don't know anyone. I don't have a choice. He said I'm the only guy that can do this. - He said you're the only guy around. - He didn't literally mean I'm the only guy around. He meant I'm the only guy around that can do this. - He's around, he couldn't do it. - You don't know that. - Oh, come on. Look at him. - You can't do this to me. Come on. - Shh. - "Shh!" No. You know what? Forget it. I'm going home. Please don't. Don't, please. Just wait here and enjoy yourself and I'll whiz back, and then we'll have a... - You're gonna be gone for hours. - No. In these situations the police usually get the gunman to the window really quickly and shoot him through the top lip, and that takes out the brain stem, so there's no reflex... action. - Hi. - Did you see Mallard? Yeah. Oh, uh, this is Claire Maddox. This is my wife, Eleanor. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah. - We should go. - Yeah. - See you in the lobby. - Yeah, okay. [Frank] Who's this? Is this Tony? Look at this guy. - [Finch] Anyway... - [Frank] How are you? - [Finch] I've gotta go. - Okay, fine, go. - Yeah? - Whatever. You'll be all right? - I'll see you soon. Okay. - Okay, go if you're gonna go. - [woman] Hey, Frank. - Hey. - Hi. - [Claire] Hey. Did you see Frank arrive, acting like he thinks he's James Bond? Yeah. I think he's really cool. He doesn't care about anything. - [elevator bell dings] - Oh. - How is that cool? - Hi. - Hi. - [Finch] Oh... I don't know, I just... - I just mean... - [doors close] I think it would be cool to be like that sometimes, you know? I care about everything, and I try my best, but nothing much seems to happen. It's because I'm boring. - Why do you say that? - Because it's true. I... I've never done anything extraordinary. I think that's why I play video games. Because they're more interesting than my real life. [gunfire on video game] - Rebel Coup? - Yeah. Do you play? - I'm trying to cut down. - Yeah, me, too. - Take that, sucker. - Nice move. Mr. Bonneville. I love your work. - Champagne? - Thank you. Cheers. You're the Frank Bonneville? - Apparently. - I listen to you every day. - Really? - I wouldn't miss it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. [chuckling] Mm. Alone? [sighs] - Yeah. - Me, too. It's a lonely life, radio. - Tell me about it. - It's so unglamorous. Yes, I know. I was just saying that to my... self. Let me guess. PR. Yes. Yes. How did you know? Well, come on. You're too attractive for Human Resources. - And not bitter enough for management. - That's nice. I'm flattered. Why radio? Why not TV or something more stimulating? - It's what I love. - Cheers. - It's what I hate. - No. Come on. - Yeah. - Oh, you are so good at it. - Like, you exude passion. - No. - It really comes across. - That's not passion. - Yeah. - That's frustration. I'm destined for bigger things, and I know it. So, in the meantime, it's just like I'm a big fish in a little pond. - Yeah. - A big... angry fish. - Yeah. [laughing] - Big, drunk, angry fish, in a tiny, - shitty little pond. - No. You know what? - At least you're honest about it. - Where's that got me? Nowhere. No more "Mr. Nice Guy," you know? Here's to cheating. [Eleanor chuckles] - [chattering] - [upbeat music playing] [Eleanor] It sounds like you're right in my ear, whispering sweet nothings. - It really does. - Resonance is better if I hold the mic... - [cell phone beeping] - Excuse me, hold on. - [Frank] Nothing serious? - Nothing serious. Let me ask you two questions. First question: - Was that from your boyfriend? - I don't have a boyfriend. - Second question: You live near here? - About five minutes. Wanna go there now? Why did you ask how far it was before you invited yourself back? If it had been a bit further away, would that have been a deal breaker? Like, five minutes, "Yeah, sure." Half-hour, "Yeah, forget it, it's too much of a hassle." - No. Wait, what? - Forget it. Come on. Let's make a move so you don't waste too much time. - Drink? - Yeah, sure. Thanks. Good night. It was fun. Do you want my number, or should I take yours? I don't think so. - You're married, right? - How did you know? Call it intuition, but not many women collect superhero toys. Apparently, they're not toys. They are "collectibles." Mm-hm. And you're the one saying I should leave at 2:30 in the morning. I don't always do this sort of thing, you know? Hey, I'm not judging, I'm just... And if you knew I was married, then you're as bad as me. Not really. I didn't tell your husband I'd be faithful to him and stand by him in sickness and health, blah, blah. - Again, not judging, just saying. - Wait, wait. You don't know anything about me or my husband. Only that you were just unfaithful to him, and he doesn't know or you wouldn't be throwing me out and being defensive. Okay, marriage doesn't always turn out like you planned, okay? I mean, he hasn't exactly fulfilled his promise. I thought he'd be something big in entertainment by now and I'd be living in a mansion in Beverly Hills. I'm pretty sure they drop that from the vows now. As for throwing you out... I just suggested that we exchange numbers, so... So we could do this again? I thought you didn't do this sort of thing all the time. - Fuck off. - Charming. [door slams] Okay. Yep, thanks. Frank! Like ten percent bigger. Better for my cheekbones, right? - [woman] Yeah. - See that? Can I get a word? Now is good. Yep, have a seat. Something's cooking in Ecuador. The intel's a little sketchy, but it looks like an uprising could be underway. Rebel troops amassing, reports of arms stockpiles, that kind of thing. They can't say exactly when it's gonna blow, but it's gonna. - You interested? - I'm gone. It's dangerous. Drug gangs ruling the streets. With guns. Kidnapping tourists... journalists. Listen, if you're not feeling as brave as you pretend... [scoffs] - ...tell me now. - [scoffs] When do I go? This afternoon. - You wanna take Claire? - No. Pointless having two journalists on the spot. Remember last time I was in Pakistan, I had transmission problems? - I should take a technician. - All right. Let's see. - Finch is available. - Fine. All right. Work it out with him. Let's go. Marie, I need two tickets to Quito. [man and woman murmuring in Spanish] - You could stay here with us. - That would be a pleasure. Thanks, guys. You're the closest thing to family I've got, if I'm honest. I've always felt at home here. - Hoping it won't come to that. - You're coming to Ecuador with me. Get your passport to admin. They need details to clear entry papers. - What, now? - Yeah, we're going this afternoon. - No. I'd love to, but it's impossible. - Why? What's the problem? My wife's left me. After the stakeout with Claire last night. I came home this morning and went to give her a hug and she just pushed... Said she needed some distance. Told me to leave her alone. Can you believe that? Don't worry. It happens to all couples. A week in Ecuador with me, it'll take your mind off things. Thanks for the offer, but I'm gonna stay around and see if I can work it out. These things are a sign. You need to move on, have an adventure. - I've written her a letter. - You've written a novel. - I had a lot to say. - And on radio station paper? Romantic. I put a few photos in, as well. To remind her of the good times. That's quite a package she's gonna receive. Actually, you're good with words. Can you have a look at it for me? Yeah, sure. - That's not how you spell "suicide." - Cheers. You know what? A country going through a rebel coup is no place to be crying over a wife who's left you. - You just need to move on. - That's funny. I'm playing a video game called Rebel Coup. Eleanor thinks it's childish, a grown man playing games. [sighs] I should've paid her more attention. But then, would I have achieved such a high score? Who knows? You know what? Maybe I'll ask someone else to come along. - Yeah. - Cheers. - How long you away for? - A week or two. - Can I get an SM58 and a MIDI MkII? - Yeah. I've changed my mind. I'm coming. That way, my wife can stay in that empty apartment, all alone, and think of me, maybe even miss me. - Great. - Are they bulletproof vests? - Yeah, they are. - What, for...? Why is the...? Why are they...? Why do they end...? Have you got bulletproof pants? Otherwise, what's the... point? Passports, entry papers and tickets. You have a United flight to Quito at 2 p.m. from Newark. - [Finch] Cheers. - Don't lose them. Why would I lose them? - I was just saying. - What, like I lost my wife? - [Claire] Do you have everything? - I think so. I wish I had one of those wheelie things now. - Listen to me. - What? When we get there, they're at war. - I don't wanna be a babysitter, okay? - I won't let you down. - What should I do with the letter? - Forget it. - What do you mean? - Who's the man in this relationship, hmm? - Don't be a pussy. - [gasps] Sexist. - What? - Nothing. - Listen, you need to grow a pair. - Of breasts? - Balls. - Oh, sorry. It's because you said "pair." Because I say "pair of breasts," but I don't say "pair of balls." - I just say "balls." - Throw the letter away. - Right. - Let her wonder where you are. After a couple weeks, you won't wanna know her anymore. Don't give me the "there's plenty more fish in the sea." I was gonna say there's plenty more women in the world. - You seen Ecuadorian girls? - No. What are they like? They're like Spanish women, but different. With ponchos. You'll see. Cheers. I'm sorry. They keep coming off. My problem is I've got slopy shoulders, so it's hard. [Claire] That is a problem. - Can we stop off at mine on the way? - What for? I've hardly got any clothes. This is all equipment. Forget it, you can get some when we get to Quito. Come on. [Finch groans] Be careful. Both of you, obviously. - It'll be dangerous. - Danger's my middle name. - Mine's Dennis. - [snickers] - See you soon, then. - Yeah. Cheers. [Eleanor] Hi, I'm not around. Leave a message. [beep] Voicemail. She obviously sees my number and she doesn't pick up because she doesn't wanna talk to me. Can I borrow your cell? She won't recognize the number. - I thought you'd let her sweat. - No, I know. But I was gonna let her know that we're going to Ecuador, a war-torn country, sort of cool-like. Yeah, no, you do cool great. That's why I'm so confident having you as my only support in a scary, dangerous, hostile place. It's like having my own John Wayne. Listen to me, you bumbling little fool, we agreed, your problems, they're your problems, not mine. - Okay? - One, rude. Two... Okay, I'll just call her back on mine. Not a problem. Thanks for your help. [Eleanor] Hi, I'm not around. Leave a message. - [beeps] - [Finch] Hi, it's me. Listen, I'm off to Ecuador to cover a pretty dangerous war. Um, we'll talk about everything when I get back. If I get back. It's cut out. Oh, it's the tunnel. Sorry, can you avoid the tunnels? [Finch groans] [chattering] Tickets. That's not the tickets, that's your letter. - I threw the letter away. - No, you didn't. It's right there. What did I throw away, then? Don't tell me you threw away the passports! You said to throw away the letter, so I threw it in the truck. - Which truck? - The garbage truck. Because I must've mixed up the... Let's go back to the station, tell them we lost the tickets, get new tickets. We'll come tomorrow. It's fine. You threw away the passports, the tickets, and the cash? Where are we gonna get new fucking passports from? - In one day! In one day! - What else are we gonna do? - Unbelievable. - I didn't do it on purpose. You're a stupid, worthless, idiotic, - incompetent piece of shit. You know that? - Yeah. - What? - Yes, I do know that. Fuck. Taxi! Yes, it's Finch and Frank! Hi! How was Ecuador? Shh! What? Is anyone from the radio station in there? - No. Why? - I'll explain later. Get in. Get in. - [Brigida] Get in. Get in. - [Finch] Oh, God. - [Domingo] That's quite a story. - It is. We need to work out what we're gonna do. - We need to brainstorm. - Brainstorm. Brainstorm. - What is a "brainstorm"? - I love these two to bits but they're not the sharpest tool in the box. Whereas you're a genius? Either of you ever thrown away your passports on the way to the airport? - Yes. - [Domingo] Okay. [Brigida] Brainstorm. Could two other people go instead of you? - What? Of course not. - [Brigida] Can you go somewhere else? - No. The story I'm covering is in Ecuador. - Oh, okay. Can you cover a different story? No. It needs to be that story, it needs to be Ecuador and it needs to be us. And we haven't got passports. - I got it. - Go on. You can use someone else's passports. - Ours. - Oh, we're screwed. - No, but she's... and we're... - [Brigida] Okay, um... You can save up money for new tickets, and by then, the passports will be here. And the war will be over. - [Domingo] That's good then. - Not for us. No, but for the people. Less will die. - [Brigida] Less will die. - They're thinking of the people. - Less will die. - You'll die, though. I'll kill you. Look... Let's go over and explain. Maybe Mallard won't fire us. He'll fire you when I tell him how fuckin' useless you are. - Language. - [Frank] Oh, my God. He's gonna think that I chickened out, that I didn't have the guts to go. That'll give him the perfect excuse to fire me. I'm gonna have to kill him. I'll go to jail. I'll get out of jail, and then I'll kill you. So, let's not do that. - Think! - Okay. They're expecting a report from us at 10:00, from Ecuador, and there's no way we can get there. We don't need to get there. They're expecting a report from Ecuador. Let's give them one on a cell phone. The same number would show whether we were in London, New York or Quito. - I can create a soundscape. A war zone. - It'll never work. It will work. It will work. Can I use your spare room? - Brainstorm. - Brainstorm. - [Brigida] Come in. Come in. Welcome. - [Domingo] Right this way. Must be great, living right above the restaurant. - Never late for work. - [Brigida] Oh, we are. - Really? - Oh, yeah, all the time. - Sure. - [Brigida] Come in, up the stairs. More stairs. Excellent. Okay. Give me half an hour. Cheers, guys. All right. [Finch mutters indistinctly] [Frank] We meant to go to Ecuador. We got as far as an apartment on top of a restaurant across the road from the radio station. - You don't like it? - Oh, no, it's lovely. [stammers] That's not what I meant. I... [sighs] No, it's fine. It's just... you know. You know Kim and Kanye? No. No, I don't. Beyonc? Jay Z? They are your friends? Friends? No. Not friends. [Brigida & Domingo speaking in Spanish] - The Jonas Brothers? - Jonas Brothers. I don't know the Jonas Brothers. You want to read about Honey Boo Boo child? - I don't know what he wants. - Okay, come on up, guys. - [door opens] - [approaching footsteps] Okay, close your eyes. Ready? [insects chirping over speakers] [birds chirping] Beautiful rain forest. Birds. [bird sounds increase] - There's monkeys. Parrots. - [animal noises] - Hold on. Here comes a tank. - [tracks rumbling] Oh. Machine-gun fire. [gunfire] Airplanes. A helicopter hovers overhead. Oh. Explosions. [gunfire and explosions] Hand grenades. - [explosions continue] - [aircraft whirring] [sounds cease] Welcome to Ecuador. [indistinct chattering] The government's just closed the borders. The information just came from the Secretary of State's office. There may have been a sarin gas warning. [Virginia] Yeah, the dispatch just came in. Okay. I'm gonna call in, if you're ready. So, guys, shout out some stuff in the background, add to the atmosphere. - What should we say? - Anything. Spanish. - [phone rings] - It's Frank. - Frank, where are you now? - I'm in Quito. - You managed to get through? - Yeah. Why? They've closed the borders. There was a sarin gas warning. You know what? Stay on the line. Let me put you through to the studio. I want you to sell Bonneville as an exclusive. Hold on. - [upbeat intro music plays] - [announcer] Q365. Our reporter, Frank Bonneville, who managed to get into Ecuador before the borders were closed, has an exclusive for Q365 News. Live from Ecuador, he will now give us the first account of this latest development. - Frank. - [Frank] In Quito, the man on the street doesn't know that tomorrow, in addition to the gunfire - and indiscriminate attacks... - [gunfire] ...the threat of chemical war looms over the city. However, the sudden closure of the border confirms the seriousness of the situation. Real Madrid! - [Domingo shouts indistinctly] - [war sounds continue] And this is a new threat the government could really have done without, Frank? [Frank] My thoughts exactly. For the last three days, they've been fighting an enemy that no bomb can possibly destroy. - Sand. - Julio Iglesias! - [gasps] - [muffled noise] Raised in squalls by the shrieking, violent wind, the desert sand has brought the city to a standstill. The men and their targeting instruments are blind. The air force is grounded. The sky has changed color. The temperature has dropped. The sun has all but disappeared, leaving the locals, the innocent victims in this bloody infighting, to wonder: what has happened to the world they once knew? This is Frank Bonneville, live from Quito. Okay, good. But I think we need more information. Because I'm pretty sure sand isn't a big problem in Ecuador. I think it's quite lush and rain-foresty and... - banana plants and things. - Okay. And also, guys, imagine you're in your village. Aah! What might you shout? [speaks in Spanish] - What does that mean? - Uncle Miguel! - Why would you shout "Uncle Miguel"? - Because he's almost deaf. Be scared. Shout something about your children. [speaking in Spanish] - What does that mean? - My baby is getting fat! - What's that got to do with anything? - Because you say: "Say something about children," and I love fat babies - because it means they're eating well. - [Finch] Yeah. - It's true. - I know, I like fat babies. Mm. What happened to the TV? The fact of the matter is that the face of poverty, no matter where you are, - is always the same. - Look at this guy, Baker. There's a guy that can fake something. He's got a bulletproof vest on, - he's 50 feet from the hotel. - How do you know where he is? Because of that fountain. I saw it from my room last time I was there. No one knows. I think we're so much better off here... Thank you... than Ecuador. We've got wine, snacks. We're not being shot at. You two make a good team. First time we've worked together, officially. On something big, like this. Yeah. - His forte is sports. - Yeah. - How many Tours de France have you done? - Twenty-five. - In France? - Nah, didn't go there. I sort of ran it from here, to make sure it all went smoothly. And the Olympics? You've done a few of those, too, right? Just four. But they are only every four years, so, not bad. - Where did you go? Beijing? - I didn't get to Beijing, no. - No, you did those from here, too, right? - Yes. Yeah. - So, have you actually been anywhere? - Yeah. - England. - No, you're from England. - That doesn't count. - Yeah. Okay. - Here, then. - Anywhere other than here. - England. - Wow. [Finch] Yeah. Every two-bit hack in New York got into Ecuador before they closed the border. - I need something special. - We got some great stuff. - We got some exclusive stuff. - You still in Quito? Are we still in Quito? No, we're in... We're in the south, we're in a place called... Machala. We thought it'd be good to get in amongst the people. Good. Yeah, yeah, give them something personal. That always gets them. All right, you're on in five. And now, we go live to our special correspondent in Quito, Frank Bonneville. The villagers could've left Sergeant Miguel to die. But they chose to save the man. A man, who, minutes earlier with his fellow troops, had been showering the area with fire and steel. This place might be a rebel stronghold, but these are kind people. It's simply not in their nature to let a man die on their land. - Whoever they are. - Oh, shit! Ooh. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Earlier today, I watched as a woman from the village desperately tried to save her own child, feverishly wiping the blood off the pavement as if that would somehow bring him back. A peasant, a fat, sweaty peasant, looked on, useless, hopeless, worthless even, knowing that nothing he ever did could possibly do any good. This is Frank Bonneville, live from Machala. [sounds cease] - Good work. - You're on again at 7:00, call back. - That's why he's the best. - I hope they're being careful. [Finch] Well, we got away with it again. Looks like we made quite an impact. - I'm not sure about this. - We can't stay in the apartment all day. We need some fresh air, some exercise. I know, but what if we're spotted? Game over, isn't it? Oh, wow. Look. Oh. [gasps] Amazing Spider-Man 14. I collect comics, so I know that's a good one. Yeah, we really should get back. Come on. [cell phone buzzing] - It's Mallard. - Shit. Don't answer it. I've gotta answer it. Hi. It's Finch. He's in the toilet. Yeah. I don't know where we are, exactly. It's all written in Spanish, obviously. - So... That's the subway. - [subway rumbling] That's what we call the trucks that drive the tanks. Yeah, because it sounds like the subway. Okay, yeah, I'll let him know. [groans] - He wants you to do a report at 1:00. - Shit. - He's onto us, man. - He's... [cell phone buzzes] Hi. Yeah, he's out. Okay, hold on. - Hello? - I just need a 60-second update, Frank, and then, uh, we'll trail something bigger. - Here? - What do you mean, "Here"? - I mean, now? - Yes, yes. We're transferring you. [man] Now we go live to Frank Bonneville in Ecuador. A cloud of dust rises into the horizon. The silence is broken by the caterpillar tracks of two rogue tanks... [mimicking tank engines] ...whose tracks are biting into the dust on the remote road. A helicopter hovers overhead. [mimicking helicopter whirring] - Is this Dr. Schmalzstein's office? - No. Shh. In the bombed-out remains of what was once his home, a young boy watches television. - [man] Blow it out your ass! - [horn honking] American television. Shells are incoming. [whistling, mimicking explosion] My technician is hit by shrapnel. Oh, no, he's fine. But we gotta get out of here. Fast. [grunting over phone] - [mimicking explosions and gunfire] - [siren wails in distance] - [mock gunfire continues] - [footsteps] It's quiet. Too quiet, if anything. [soundscape begins] In the sky, a combat helicopter stops. An explosion rings out. My own technician has another near miss. A bullet flies inches above his head. Luckily for him, he's so short, or he'd most certainly be dead by now. This is Frank Bonneville, Q365 News. [man]Coming up at 7:00, we will have another exclusive from Frank Bonneville. That was too close for comfort. We can't get caught out like this again. We've gotta plan this, be in control. And we need something new. When Mallard first asked you to go to Ecuador, what did he say, exactly? Just that the rebel forces were amassing arms, weapons. - What else? - Conjecture, rumors. [sighs] That's enough for you, though, isn't it? Anything that sells news. - Well, if people weren't so gullible... - That's it. - What? - We start a rumor. One that can't be proved wrong. We invent someone, someone behind all this. And when people say, "Oh, we can't find this guy, who is he?" "Well, no, of course you can't find him. He's elusive. He's an evil genius. He's protected by a loyal army. He can work for anyone. Be funded by anyone." They'll just deny it, though, won't they? So, the headline would read "So-and-so denies funding terrorists." - Great. - That's unethical, though. Yeah, but it's news. What's a popular Spanish name? Alvarez. Santiago. Emilio. [Frank] The man is Emilio Santiago Alvarez, the instigator of the attacks against government forces in Ecuador. A small man, with no profile, no international presence. But here, in the jungles and towns of southern Ecuador, he's become a folk hero... a man unafraid to stand up and be counted. But on the street, rumors persist that Alvarez may not be working alone. His rebel forces are too well equipped, too well trained, too well fed. It's said, and I must stress at this point, these rumors are uncorroborated... that maybe Alvarez has friends in high places. Perhaps a little too close to home. Jesus, is he saying that the rebel forces are being funded by the U.S.? [Frank] This is Frank Bonneville, Q365 News. [Mallard] That's huge. Good one. Couldn't have done better myself. - We can keep this going for ages. - Yeah, let's see if they buy it first. - They will. - [gunfire on video game] They will. [Secretary of State] Does Bonneville realize the mess he's made by allowing speculation that this Alvarez is working for the Americans? Most probably, Madam Secretary. Goddamn it. Why have we not heard of this man before? Where's your intelligence? Our agents in Ecuador are tracing him now. It's a good chance they know him by another name. A nickname. And if they don't find him, government forces will. They're now looking for Bonneville to make him confess his sources. And Alvarez's men are after him because he revealed too much. He and his technician are in serious danger. I do not wanna end up with two dead citizens nor the wrath of their families. You are going to tell Finch and Bonneville to get to the American embassy in Quito as soon as possible. We need to know they're safe. Once they're safe, we will extract them. That is something we know how to do. Little is known about the mastermind behind the uprising, rebel fighter Emilio Alvarez. The charismatic leader of the Ecuadorian Liberation Front is believed to come from humble beginnings. The son of an unemployed, left-wing atheist father and an unmarried mother with Communist sympathies. So, in your view, Alvarez has been quietly amassing a force for some time now. What I'm hearing from my sources is that Alvarez has risen to a position of power in the Ecuadorian Liberation Front for some years. I always knew he made up most of the shit he reported. So, why haven't we heard of him before? - Well, it makes perfect sense. - How is he keeping a straight face? ...less chance for the opposition of targeting you. Successful revolution is all about protecting your leaders. So, Frank Bonneville has gone where no other news reporter has gone before in bringing this man to the public's attention. - I wouldn't say that. - [cackling] I've known about Alvarez myself for a while now. I just didn't think it was appropriate to unmask him yet. [Finch] Oh, come on. - Oh. - [glasses clink] [Finch chuckles] [cell phone rings] Hello? Yeah. Right. Uh-huh. [Finch] What? Okay. Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'll call you as soon as we get to Quito. Okay, thanks. - We're screwed. - Why? - Everyone's looking for us, apparently. - They won't find us. Of course they won't, that's not the point. - What is? - Mallard wants us to get to the U.S. embassy in Quito immediately. For our own safety. The ambassador's waiting for us, okay? It's probably a few hours' drive from Machala to Quito. I promised I'd call him as soon as we got there. - As in, a few hours from now. - Right. - What are you gonna do? - Nothing. - Because I'm not gonna call him. - Why not? Because if I call him, he'll call the embassy to arrange us to be flown home, - and they'll say we're not there. Right? - Right. Yeah. What will he think if you don't call him at all? - That something's happened to us. - We're just missing? Yeah, that we're missing. They can trace us, though. That's what they'd do if they thought we were missing. - So, we'd have to destroy our phones. - We only have to destroy the SIM card. - Right. - Oh, God. How can you destroy it? It doesn't... You can't even... Shall I just swallow it? Yeah, swallow it so they can trace it straight to your ass! Why didn't we just go back in the first place and just say: "Sorry, we threw away the tickets and passports"? Why did you throw the fucking ticket and the passport away in the first place? - [shouts] That's the fucking question! - Shut up! What will they think we're arguing about downstairs? - I don't care! - Are you mental? Fucking hell. There. It's destroyed, okay? What are they gonna say, "What were you arguing about last night?" - In their house. - [sighs] You're such a pig. [Mallard] We haven't heard from them since 10:00 last night. Maybe they lost communication, maybe they've been arrested. Whatever the case, we need to be very quiet about this for now. All right, drop everything, check the hotels, hospitals, anybody we might know in the area who might have seen them. And at some point, we have to let Ian's wife know. - Leave it with me. - Okay. - [phone rings] - I need a map of Ecuador, ASAP. - [Claire] Got it. - Q365 News. Hold on. It's Barrymore at the New York Post. [Barrymore] There's that little guy. Okay, Barrymore, I gotta tell you, I don't have time. What? I know you've got a big problem. I just spoke to my correspondent in Quito. I don't know anything. I can't say anything. I need photos for a profile piece. Should I send a courier? - Being a bit hasty, aren't you? - If I know about it then other people do, too, and it'll get out. Send your courier. Okay, story's out. Change of plans. You're going on at 7:00. Just say we've lost contact with our special correspondents in Ecuador - but let's not panic everyone. - Right. - You got this. - Yeah. Okay. Oh, hold on. Excuse me, have you got PC Gamer? Look. Look. And uh, and the New York Post. Thanks. Cheers. [Finch groans, sighs] - [Eleanor] Do you want a drink? - [Claire] Uh, no, I'm fine. Thank you. You know, when you're in broadcasting... any number of things can happen, but they aren't necessarily serious. If that's the case, then they're gonna call any minute now. Do you know Frank well? Uh, Frank? We've been working together for about five years. He's a great journalist. Bit of a loner. But I've been working with Ian even longer. He's such a kind soul. - You must be worried sick. - Yeah. What do you mean, "loner"? Uh... Well... you know what? Actually, I could do with a drink. Aren't you gonna record our conversation? Oh, no. This is strictly off the record. Because I tell you, it is a very interesting story. My life, before I met Ian. - Before? Yeah. - Yeah, you know, special interest. Because it might make people engage with their plight even more. Well, maybe next time. I don't wanna add to your... stress. I mean, sometimes I think that my life has been too dramatic. And I almost wish it was more, like, uh... plain and boring. Well... [chuckles] - I should go. Sorry. I'm so sorry. - Clumsy. [clears throat] [Claire] Nothing yet leads us to give in to anxiety, even if foreign journalists today incur increasingly real risks. [man] Thank you, Claire Maddox. And coming up next, baseball. If you don't get in touch at all, they're going to think you're dead. - Or taken hostage, or, yeah. - Taken hostage? - Yeah. - We're taken hostage. - What do you mean? - If we can fake being in Ecuador, - we can fake being taken hostage. - That's bad. - That's not a good idea. - [Frank] It's not bad, it's genius. You're a genius. - Am I? - Yeah. - He's a genius. - He is a smart man. Nah. - It's a very good idea. - [Finch] Is it? I don't know. - [Domingo] Baby, you're blocking Ian. - [Brigida] Oh, sorry. - [Domingo] Okay. Okay. - [Finch] Okay. [Domingo] It's recording. - And... - [Brigida] Wait, wait, wait! - Okay. - [Domingo] Okay. Ready? - Yeah. - Okay. Hello. Don't smile and say "hello." For God's sake. - What do you mean? - You're in mortal danger. You got two guys that wanna kill you. Are they high heels? - What rebel soldier wears high heels? - They make my legs look longer. - It looks good, baby. [growls] - [Brigida] Thank you, baby. Okay, no smiling. No hello. Just straight to it. [sighs] We are hostages of the Ecuadorian Liberation Front. Um, and I am talking to the president of the United States here when I say the situation is simple. If you do not pay the ransom, we will be executed. - Stop. Okay. - What? Why are you talking so casually, so nonchalant? You gotta be begging. Begging for your life. This guy, he wants to kill you. He wants to stick you like a pig, so you need to beg. - A nice word to your family, to your wife. - Yeah. The lens? That's the whole world, right there. - You gotta connect. - Yeah. - Do you understand? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. President. Beg the president, mention the family, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. No smiling. We are hostages of the Ecuadorian Liberation Front, and I beg you, Mr. President, please help us. Also, uh, tell my family I love them, tell my wife... Why are you asking the president to run errands for you? - Ugh. I don't know, I just... You said... - Talk to them directly, to the lens. - Dear Mr. President, wife, family... - Stop. - Get up. - [groans] What? - [Frank] Okay. Shake it out. - Oh! - [Brigida] Take that, American pig! - That wasn't part of the video. - What was that for? - To help you get into your role. Who am I? Daniel Day-Fucking-Lewis? Why am I doing this - if you're the charismatic broadcaster? - Exactly. I can't do it. No one's gonna feel sorry for me. I got the looks, I got the charm, I got the body. No sympathy. You, on the other hand, you begging for your life? It's pathetic. It's like an ugly runt, mongrel dog that no one wants, - that has to be put down. - Yeah, I get the point. [whispers] Didn't have to hit me. [Brigida] You've got this, Finch. My name is Ian Finch. This is Frank Bonneville. We work for the New York radio station Q365 News. [Frank] You wanna see these? No, I don't wanna see anything. And I'm not talking to you. As you wish. In the end, you were great, though. I'm sorry for what I did, but it was for authenticity, - for the good of the cause. - Didn't have to hit me that hard. So, can I hit you now? - [scoffs] You can try. - No, I should just be allowed to hit you. - Why? - For the good of the cause. But it wouldn't be, that would just be you getting revenge. Not fair. Here you go. There it is. Take it over to the radio station, make sure no one sees you. [Finch] My name is Ian Finch. This is Frank Bonneville. We work for the New York radio station Q365 News. We were reporting here on the unrest in Ecuador when we were taken hostage by the Ecuadorian Liberation Front. We have not been harmed. If America submits to their demands, we will be set free to return to the United States. - Well, they're still alive. - If their demands are not met, however, we will be executed, never to see our families again. Please take these people seriously. They want money to fund their cause. They will contact you in the future. Until then, you won't hear from us again. [man]Good evening, and welcome to this special broadcast dedicated to Frank Bonneville and Ian Finch. I'm joined by their colleague, Claire Maddox, from Q365 News. Uh, it's a very worrying time for the press. Nothing can justify taking journalists hostage. The only thing they're guilty of is doing their job. - You know she has a thing for you, right? - Ridiculous. You never noticed? All those times she brought you a cup of coffee? She brought everyone a cup of coffee. - Really? - Yeah. - Didn't she? - No. Just you. And you never once bought her a cup in return. Hello. I have a wife. - [scoffs] Not anymore you don't. - All right. You need to get over her. Move on. ...danger they face is indifference and being forgotten. - And we shall not forget them. - Well, you make a good point. Claire is not the only guest we have tonight. We also have the wife of Ian Finch. Please welcome Eleanor Finch. - Welcome, it's so good to have you. - Thank you. Please, have a seat. Thanks so much for coming on for the show today. - It must be very trying right now. - [Eleanor] Yeah. It is. - That's your wife? - I know. - Punching above my weight. - [Eleanor] I decided to come on your show in the hope that this'll be broadcast in Ecuador and maybe my husband will see it. I've kept silent in the hope that any negotiations would be successful, but the wait is unbearable. [man] I understand, and the whole country is feeling for you right now. I know. The letters of support, the portraits hanging in all the cities tell me the compassion that the American people have for the hostages, - for my husband. Thank you. - [man] You're so right. And, together, we stand firm for Ian and Frank to return amongst us. - She loves me. - Of course she does. - I have no right to do this to her. - [Eleanor] I hope you don't mind, uh, I've written a song for the hostages. Something to make sure we don't forget them. - Yeah. - [Eleanor] I thought I might sing it. - I have a backing track. - Oh. Uh, okay. Um... - Okay? - All right. Uh... Thank you. - Okay, so it's, uh... - It's called "A Dollar For A Hero." - Let's hear it now, a world exclusive. - Can I stand? Yes, please do. Here she is, Eleanor Finch. [audience applauding] [slow piano music playing] Can you spare a dollar for a hero And bring him home to me? In God we trust And fight we must To return to this land of liberty I hope you're with The ones you love I hope you're together Safe at home But can you spare A dollar and a prayer To one in danger and alone? Can you spare a dollar for a hero? America, hear my plea And although it's only one We're sending George Washington And he's gonna bring My baby home to me Oh, America The land of the free [cheering] That was amazing. Very special. It was just so moving. Thank you, and I'd also like to appeal to the generosity of the American public. Okay, please do. Um, if each of you just give a dollar for our heroes, our hostages. I'm launching a campaign to raise money... What are you doing? - I'm sending her a dollar. - What for? - For the heroes. - Great idea. So, you can donate on my website, Eleanor needs your help. Thank you. That was great. [man] Today is the eighth day that Frank Bonneville and Ian Finch have been held hostage in Ecuador. We shall not forget them. You can still make your donations to A Dollar For Our Heroes. Just to remind you, you can still make your donations to A Dollar For Our Heroes. And we at Q365 News want to thank you all for your emails of concern. We share your thoughts. We hope that Ian and Frank will be home soon. - [Claire] You wanted to see me? - Listeners can't get enough. The ratings are officially insane. We're the number one radio station in New York. I never thought I'd be able to say that. Two of our friends are being held hostage. Uh-huh. You're a good boss, but you're a shitty person sometimes. - I'm sorry? - You're excited that there's a news buzz - around two human beings in danger. - Not just them. Eleanor Finch. The country has adopted her, they can't get enough, they love her. They want more. I want you to keep an eye on her. Hang out. Maybe become friends. I don't know. There's more to her story here, so get it and bring me. You want to know if she's lost her appetite, if she takes sleeping pills before bed, if she has a lover? You want me to be a spy? Well, I'd like you to be a journalist! [Eleanor] Are you guys hogging the rubber bands? Yes, you are. [phones ringing] [sighs] Hey. There's a dollar in the hundies, come on. You gotta be careful. Recount it. "A Dollar For Our Heroes." That is a great idea. It's catchy. - You've been busy. - Yeah. One of my skills. Organization, fund-raising. I have a high likability factor, so, it's easy to get people to donate. Want a T-shirt? - Sure. - I don't know, can you wear orange? Ew. No. We need to do something about all this cash. There's $124,000 of it. Ooh. Yeah, we have a safe. Ian keeps all his prized possessions in it. Comics. We need to be super vigilant. - We need to account for every cent. - Sure. - [Chris] Hello. Hi. - Hi. - Chris Denby. - Ah. - New York Post. - Yes, of course. [chuckles] I gotta go be in makeup from morning to evening. I hate it. - Oh. You're doing it for Ian, so... - Yeah. I am. Mrs. Finch, please, if we could, um... - You know, against those things, there. - Mm-hm. Hm. These are his Disney characters. Superman and stuff. - Marvel. And it's Captain America. - [camera shutter clicking] They're really great. Oh. You must really hate doing these interviews and things, when you're so worried. - Yeah, but somebody's gotta do it. - [Chris] Nice. Hold on. [chuckling] [camera shutter clicks] - You should interview me. - For what? For anything you want. Anyone'll run an interview on me. You should do it. You know me. You know the boys. You know the names of the little toys. Could be a big opportunity for you. From radio to TV? Could be your big break. [chuckles] - [Brigida] That's your house. - [Finch] Yeah. - Claire. - That's Claire. Eleanor, you put Ian's Marvel collection up for public auction. - What? - You must be thrilled by the results. - I am over the moon. I am so blown away. - She sold my Marvel collectibles. - They're just models. - They're not models. They're perfect original figurines. And the sum will be added to the donations of the American people. I thank them from the bottom of my heart in the name of my husband, Ian Finch. [Claire] Why did you choose to sell this particular collection? [Eleanor] Well, first of all, all the characters are extremely popular and the most rare originals around, and I just thought they would raise the highest amount. What good are plastic superheroes, when my husband, a real hero, is off languishing in God knows where? - Ecuador. - Ecuador. We haven't even asked for a ransom and she's already sold my collection. She wants to be ready for when they make demands. - She already has the cash. - Who's "they"? - The kidnappers. - There are no... We're the kidnappers. And I'm not about to ask my wife for so much money that she has to sell my prized possessions. We're not gonna ask for money. That's not the point. - So why she sell your dollies? - Oh, for... They're not dollies. Listen, please. Keep up. They're collectibles. [Brigida] They look like dollies. [upbeat song plays] [inaudible dialogue] [inaudible dialogue] [laughing] Yeah, you know, I am anguished. [chuckles] There's a lot of sorrow. There's, um, a lot of grief. I never got a chance to say, "I love you." I didn't get that chance. At the same time, there's so many blessings that are coming my way. - Right. Okay. - I mean, the fact that the song is number one on iTunes for two weeks running, right? - Two weeks. Right. - I mean, that's a dream come true. I know you do want to reach out to the kidnappers and let them know that you're willing to pay for their release. Of course. And I also wanna let my fans know that, um, I'm working on another album. [audience applauds] - On a bona fide album. - I've got a shitty wife. - What do you mean, exactly? - She doesn't care about us. About me. This is just promoting herself. ...move away from that, you know? Um... She does seem a little happy about things. - Just a bit. Loving it. Although... - [Frank] Yeah. [laughing] ...I don't really care that she's left me anymore. See? I knew you'd get over her. Well, I can see her for what she really is now. And it's... Nah. [sighs] - I can see her side a little bit, too. - What do you mean? Well, she did leave her family and friends behind to follow you to New York. Probably pictured both of you making it big and suddenly she finds herself in a one-bedroom apartment with a guy who likes to spend his spare time with comic books - and playing video games. - I thought she was happy. Sorry. I'm glad you're over her. You can move on with your life. You've got a big fan out there. So, who are some of your musical influences? How do you know I live in a one-bedroom apartment? Hmm? "She finds herself in a one-bedroom apartment." I don't know that it's a one-bedroom apartment. It's a figure of speech. "One-bedroom apartment" is a figure of speech? It's like, "Oh, I don't live in the mansion I thought I was gonna live in." I don't literally mean a one-bedroom apartment. I literally live in a one-bedroom apartment. - So, it sounds like a diss. - Oh, no, no. I didn't mean it like that. I live in a one-bedroom apartment. So, it's not a bad thing. - You made it sound bad. - No. And you made the playing video games, reading comics a bad thing, as well. - It's not what every woman likes in a man. - Good. Because I don't want... I don't like her to want me anymore. Because I don't want her anymore. [Claire] As the world waits and worries about our two journalists in Ecuador, the whole station joins me in thinking of Ian Finch, - whose birthday it is today. - [Frank] Happy birthday. - This is Claire Maddox... - I'd forgotten. Claire remembered. She always does. Everyone's being so nice. I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry. I'm calling it a day. - [chuckles] Calling it a day? Really? - Yeah. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. I can't do this anymore. We can't just walk across the street and say, "Hi, we're home." - No, I know. No. - Can we? We have to get to the U.S. embassy in Quito. Which means, we have to go to Ecuador for real. - Why do we have to go to Ecuador? - It's that or we go to jail. Why did we do all this if we've still gotta go to Ecuador? This was all your idea, and we didn't know it was gonna get so out of hand. What do we do? How do we get there? We gotta get across the country. I guess we drive. We get to the West Coast. From there, we get on a boat and we go down to Quito. Illegally, because we don't have any passports. Oh, God. This is a good birthday present, isn't it? "Oh, sorry. Happy birthday. You've gotta go to Quito after all." [Frank sighs] - [Finch] Thanks for everything. - [Domingo] Anytime. - If you hadn't been there... - I was there. Sure. And don't worry about your car. I'll get it back to you. Return safely, that's all I ask. You give those kidnappers hell. There aren't really... Yeah. Okay. - We gotta go. - Okay. - You need money? - [Finch] We're on our way to get money. - I know where there's lots of money. - [Brigida] Where? [door creaks] - [Finch] She's in bed. - [Frank] I'll wait here. - It'll be all over in five minutes. - Well, come in with me. - No, we agreed I wouldn't have to. - Why? - We just did. - But why did we? - No reason. - Well, come in with me, then. - Okay, but don't wake her up. - Shh. - Why do you even have a safe? - In case I get burgled. I've got expensive comics. I've always wanted one, as well. They're really cool. [safe beeps] - [Finch] How much shall I take? - [Frank] A few more, just in case. [Frank sighs] Hiya. Uh, surprise. Um, Frank Bonneville, this is my wife, Eleanor. - Hi. - What are you doing here? Aren't you glad that we're alive and well? See what I mean? You'd have more chance with her than me. - Definitely not. - No. Before you explain why you're not being held hostage in Ecuador, tell me, - why are you stealing my money? - We need it, to, um, bribe our way into Ecuador. To... [clears throat] Because I threw away the tickets and passports at the airport. - What do you mean? - I didn't mean to. I thought I was throwing away the letter that I wrote you. That, um... - What are you talking about? - It's a long story. - It's not your money. - Excuse me? It's not your money. People gave that money so we wouldn't be in danger, but we're not in danger, so it's their money, but they don't need to know that. So, it's definitely not yours. So, now I got nothing again. You ruin everything. Well, weren't you gonna spend it anyway, to pay our ransom? Of course. But, like, you clearly don't need it now. You don't care if we live or die. You're in your element. All the fame, all the attention. So long as you're still in the picture, but you can feel it all slipping away. That's why you wanna hold on to all the cash. What? Like you're so perfect. Maybe it's time the world knew a few home truths about you. I think they'd learn even worse things about you. - I don't care. - I think you would. Look, how about this? Let's go 50-50. We take our share, get into Ecuador, turn up at the American embassy, say we've been released, you say you paid the ransom, - keep the cash. - We'll need evidence I paid the ransom. We're the evidence. We were kidnapped, and now we're free. They're not gonna expect receipts from a bunch of Ecuadorian kidnappers. - Who did I give the money to? - [Finch] You didn't. You were told to leave it under a bridge because you... didn't wanna involve the police, because they told you they'd kill us. So, you just left the money for collection under a bridge. - What bridge? - "What bridge"? Any bridge. They'll check. They'll find no money there because the bad men came and took the money and gave it to the bad men that were kidnapping us. It works. Okay, done. - [Finch] Yeah. - Get out. [upbeat song plays] [inaudible dialogue] [coughs] Oh. Jesus Christ. What was that? [Finch grunting] Bugs. [birds and insects chirping] [vehicle rumbling] - Truck. - There's a truck. Yo! Yo! Hi. Hi. Oh. Hey. Hi. Thanks for stopping. - Where you go? - Quito. - We need to get to the embassy. - We can pay you and everything. - Ah, Americanos. - English. Although I have lived and worked in America. - Doesn't need your life history. - Want to eat? No, it's fine, we're going straight to the embassy. Embassy a few hours away. I need to eat. - I know a good place. - I'm quite hungry. - This guy needs to eat, so... - Of course. Yeah. Okay. Let's go there. [Finch grunts, sighs] Brilliant, cheers. [chattering nearby] [man grunts] [man shouts indistinctly] - It's good. - Sure. [off-key piano notes] Oh, God. Jazz. [banging and grunting] Oh, good. Not jazz after all. Hi. Hey. Oh. Nice. Morning. Hi. Hiya. Oh. Rustic, isn't it? [sighs] No air-conditioning, though. Makes you drink more, doesn't it? Crafty. - He looks like he's had enough. - We're gonna eat and then leave. Sure. Shall I call for a menu? Don't know who's working here. - Hey. - Hi. - Americano? - Uh, well, English. But I, um... Yeah. You look handsome. And rich. You must be very successful. - I do okay, babe. - Let's go. Uh, no. - But, you know, you look tired. - I am tired. Do you want something to wake you up? - Sure. - Okay. No. You sniff it. [sniffs] - What the fuck are you doing? - You want some? - No, we're going. - We're not going. - We're going! - We're not going. Listen to me. My wife left me, okay? Presumably for someone better. Who isn't better than me? Just having a bit of fun, to remind me that life's worth living. [sniffs] Give me that, please. What the hell. Funny, isn't it? [banging on counter] - Hello. - Gentlemen. Hi. [chuckles] - So, you like the sample, eh? - Thank you. - And now, you gotta buy. - [Frank groans] I knew it. [Finch] That's fair enough. Gotta make a living. He's given us a little free sample, you know. So, I'll have one. Thank you. Cheers. There you go. - I won't do it now. [chuckles] - [man laughs] In fact, I think I'd better hide it. I don't want them finding this at the embassy. Don't worry about it. They won't. [both groan] - [Frank] Shit. - Come on, let's go, papi. Let's go, come on. - Move. - Okay. - Come on, move! - Okay. [bandit 1] Move. [Finch] All right. - [bandit 2] Let's go. - [bandit 1] Move. Keep an eye on them. [chickens clucking] [man yells in Spanish] [bandit] Get out. Let's go. Let's go, get out. Move. [Finch] Okay. [bandit] Move. Hey! In there. Over there. Over there, move. Now go. Go, go, go. - Look at this. - [bandit] Enjoy the view. [bandits chattering and laughing] Gotta love tourists. They're nice people. - Very nice. - Excuse me. There's no toilet... in here. [cackling] - Sorry about this. - Don't worry about it. What do you mean, "don't worry about it"? I have to tell you something. Um... [sighs] Probably gonna end up dying here, and I don't wanna have to die - with this on my conscience, so... - What now? [sighs] I'm just gonna say it. I slept with your wife, Eleanor. - The night of the party. - No, you didn't. What do you mean? - I didn't know who she was. - You're serious? I didn't know she was your wife. [Finch exhales] How do you think that makes me feel? That my wife just... - has it off with anyone? - Hardly. The first smarmy bastard who comes along. Just a big phony and a liar and a cheat. Oh, I feel sick. [Frank sighs] So, you've been laughing at me behind my back all this time. No, not at all. I felt terrible when I found out. I like you. - You got a funny way of showing it. - I did not know she was your wife. - So you keep saying. - She's the one to blame. She knew she was married to you. She chose not to share that with me. So, you wouldn't have done it if you had known? Of course not. What do you think of me? Maybe she'll really try and get us out now. She'll be killing two birds with one stone, won't she? She'll be getting her husband back and her lover. [Frank sighs] Morning. [groans] Hey, man, I'm sorry. I wouldn't have said anything. I thought you were over her. I am over her, so, don't say anything. Let's just get through this. [grunts] You okay? Go. [speaks in Spanish] - Thank you. - Mm-hm. - [Finch] Thank you. - [Frank] Thank you. - Have you got any bread? - It's not room service. - Are you a prisoner, too? - Of course he's a prisoner. - Maybe he can help. - He can't help, look at him. He is helping us. He brought us food, didn't he? - Let him go. He's terrified. - Okay. Thank you. Chili for breakfast. Oh. It's really hot as well. [breathing heavily] Mm. [gagging] If you hold your nose, you can't taste it as much. - Really? - [gagging] - Who do you think these people are? - They're bandits. They're gonna ask for ransom. - Who's gonna pay that? - I don't know. Government? - Not the U.S. government. - What do you mean? - They don't negotiate with terrorists. - Why? [door opens] - Journalist, okay? - [Frank] Yeah. - And you? - No. Uh, I'm a technician. - Is your boss rich? - No, not at all. - Is your family rich? - [Finch] No. My wife has got cash, at the moment. - She has, she's got loads. - Your wife? Mm. She'll pay, then you'll release us, yeah? Unharmed. - Yeah, of course. - [Finch] Don't... Yeah. Okay. You're gonna call your wife, okay? - Okay. - Call her. - She's never gonna believe him. - Shh. Let's keep it positive. - What do you say to him? - Call your wife. - Good. Good. - I am. - How much money do you want? - [man] 100,000 for each of you. - That's a lot. - [man] Shh. Well, it is. I'm saying. I'm not gonna promise anything, but we're gonna get you what... - [playing piano scales] - [cell phone rings] - Hello? - [Finch] Eleanor. - What do you want? - Right, we're in Ecuador, and we've been captured by bandits and they want $200,000 - or they're gonna kill me and Frank. - Stop it. Where are you calling me from? - Where are we exactly? She wants to know. - $300,000. Hear that? He put it up. That's what we're dealing with, unreasonable. Do you think I'm an idiot? I'm keeping that money. I raised it, I gave you your half. Stop trying to con me out of mine. She thinks we're conning her. She doesn't believe me. - She thinks we're trying to get her money. - She doesn't trust him. - You gotta talk to her. - [Finch] You talk to her. - [Frank] Talk to her, please. - I'm gonna hand you to the head bandit. - Bandido. So, you speak to her. - [Eleanor sighs] - Hello, ma'am. - Eleanor. - What's that? - Eleanor. [man] Eleanor. Eleanor, if you don't pay, I'm gonna kill your husband and Mr. Franks. Kill everybody. Greetings from New York. - What'd she say? - She said to kill you all. - She said that? - She said that, yeah. - That's what I'm dealing with. - Who is this? - That's my wife. - [man] Your wife makes me very sad. Welcome to my world, son. I'm glad you spoke to her, though, first-hand. - Urgh! - I know. She's... - [speaks in Spanish] - Yeah. [speaking in Spanish] [man growls] That's nice, isn't it? "Kill them." I can't believe she just did that. She hung up? She said, "Kill them." And then... [bandits speaking indistinctly] - [bandit 1] We gotta be professional. - [bandit 2] I was professional. [bandit 1] You were not professional. [bandit 2] I did exactly what you told me to. [loudly] Thank you. [bandit] What the fuck did you just do? Hey, come on. Hey! - No, no, no. Is okay. Is okay. - [Finch] Sorry. [cocks gun] - Who the fuck are you talking to? - Nothing. He's sorry. We're sorry. Sorry. [Frank sighs] [clucking] - [Frank] What are you thinking? - Thinking that chili was definitely off. Speed of sound is about 350 meters per second, a bit less. A bullet is about 400 meters per second. So, if they shoot us, we'll be dead before we hear the bang. - Great. So, we won't jump, then. - No. - I'm scared. - You weren't yesterday, in the bar. That was the cocaine. Look. Maybe this will make me a little bit braver again. [chuckles] Popeye on spinach. Where is it? Your sweat probably dissolved it. - I can taste it. Do you want some? - Yeah. Why don't I suck your toes, too? No. Mm. It's all coming out. Ah. [tapping] Ah. I've got, like, a toothache all over. [groans] - That was way too much for one. - How's your heart? Yeah, it feels like my heart's in my brain. - How's your balls? - Non-existent. They've shrunk. And the willy. It's like a little snail going into its shell. Dense. It's like the same matter in a much smaller... [groans] They're the least of my problems. I... Oh, my God. I feel like I'm gonna burst. If you feel bad, it makes it bad. - If you feel good, you feel good. - You okay? You feel good, and if bad, it's the, um... Uh... Oh, God. [groaning] - You gonna be all right? - Yeah. Better not, because they're... [mutters] Fucking, like, "Hey, man." Fuck you. You're nothing but a bitch. Gonna slap them. They're pussies, really. They come in, "Fuck you. No, give me that." Fuck off, you bitch. Suck my balls. [truck approaches outside] I've got terrible gut rot. - [heavy metal music playing nearby] - Motorhead, "Ace of Spades." That's what I call myself on Rebel Coup. - "Ace of Spades." That's a good omen. - [Frank] Great omen. So, you have no one that loves you that is willing to pay money to get you back. Completely useless to us. Worthless. We might as well get some entertainment out of you. You two are fighting to the death. Come on, get up. Can I use the toilet, please? - I need to... - Come on, get up. What do you mean fight to the death? That's ridiculous. - That's right. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're gonna shoot me? The other ones are going to hear the shots, they're gonna come in here: pop, pop, pop. - Shoot you to bits. - I don't care. We're gonna die anyway. No. Only one of you will die, you see? You're gonna fight each other to the death. The winner will be free. Shoot him. Shoot him. You're thinking you'd win, aren't you? - I would win. - You don't know that. - He definitely will. - [Finch] You don't know that. - Look at you and look at him. - You don't know what I can do. So, don't... Just... [breathing heavily] - I can't do it. - Oh, God. Give it to me. [guffawing] Are you gonna shoot me now? This is just... It's not as easy as it looks, right? - [grunts] - [loud fart] - [men shouting indistinctly nearby] - [Finch groans] - Oh, I've shit myself. - [man shouts in Spanish] [grunts] Oh, fuck! Fucking... My fucking balls! Fuck, you shot my fucking balls, man. [heavy metal music playing] Aah! The Jeep! [gunfire] [Finch groaning] [grunts] [Finch] Go, go, go, go, go. - [both laughing] - Whoo! [cheering] - [fires shots in the air] - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo! - [fires round into truck] - [Frank] Come on! - [Finch] I'm sorry. [man on radio] Frank Bonneville and Ian Finch, the two radio employees held hostage for nearly a month, have been released. They were welcomed at the U.S. embassy in Quito and are said to be exhausted, but unharmed and in good spirits. The Ecuadorian Liberation Front claim responsibility for the kidnapping and are believed to have been paid their ransom by Eleanor Finch - from the public's generous donations. - Thank you. This is Q365 News, saying: welcome home, boys. [band playing "A Dollar For A Hero"] [cheering] You must be so proud. I am. It's probably the best song I've written. [inaudible dialogue] Frank, welcome back. I was wrong about you. Which part? The bit about being a drunk, arrogant hack - who doesn't care about anybody? - Yeah. No, you weren't. I'm a work in progress. - Hmm. - And Finch finally did something brave. Really? Not yet. [Finch] Hey. Don't worry. We'll never tell anyone you weren't really kidnapped. - No, we were kidnapped. - Of course. Sure. [woman] Ladies and gentlemen, Frank Bonneville. [cheering] Well, thank you. Thank you. Uh... He's the one you should be applauding, because let me tell you something... Ian Finch is a hero. Okay? He may look like a squat, ineffectual nobody, but he is the real man here. - [cheers and applause] - [ring clatters] [man] What's it like to have your husband back? - [Frank] Thank you. Thank you. - Great. It's so great. And what's next for Eleanor Finch? Um, well, my album is due out, as you know, and I'm starting a perfume line. ...I thought I'd never get to see my own country again. [applause, cheering] - Hi. - Hi. - Brought you a coffee. - Why? Well, because you always bring me a coffee. I bring everyone coffee. - Do you? - No. Good. Good work with the... Uh... Uh... Um... Exactly, that's what I was trying to say. [Claire chuckling] - This is going well. - [Claire] Yeah. [Finch] Isn't it? I'm just gonna uh... walk past... - [Claire] Hello. - [Finch] Hi. ...these people, who would probably give us a lift. But we seem to be walking to Manhattan. - [Claire chuckles] - Is that good? - I have coffee, so... - You didn't want milk, did you? - I did, but... - Okay, good. Well, we... There's a shop on the Upper East Side that I know. We're probably not allowed to go across there. [Claire chuckles] [Claire] This is like the end of a movie. [Finch] A low-budget movie, maybe. [Claire laughs] ["A Dollar For A Hero" plays]
