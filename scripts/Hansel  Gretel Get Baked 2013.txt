Eh, just a little knock, I'll be right back. It's probably just my brother, Hansel. just keep a little bit of an eye on her. You must be Hansel. What took you so long? Nearly had to go to colorado to find a spot. Or you could have just parked in my driveway. Your driveway, yeah, okay. Would have been easier. So has she seen ashton? No. That's definitely gotta be cold by now. Let me just put on a fresh new pot, It will only take me a minute. Okay. We should really be going. It will just take me a minute. I'm sorry, I need to find my boyfriend, not sit around drinking tea. Gretel. Look, I'm really just trying to help. She's just under a lot of stress from looking for her boyfriend. I think I just need to take her home, But, thank you for your time, we're sorry to have troubled you. There's no trouble. I love having young people around. Thank you. You know it'd be nice, if you could be a little more supportive. You're adopted. Good boy, franz. I met your girlfriend. She's very beautiful, and so young. It's just a curse, growing old. Fortunately for you, You don't have to. Mmm, this is better. So, let me get this straight. Your boyfriend went out to get something, Which you won't say what it is And then he didn't return. How long ago was that? About 24 hours ago, right, Hansel? Yeah, uh, I mean, give or take an hour. What were you two fighting about? We weren't fighting. He went out to get some stuff, And never came back. Would that "stuff" Happen to be marijuana? Because, one ashton crawford has racked himself up Quite a few frequent flyer points In our misdemeanor marijuana program. So? He's still missing. Come on, hart, this is a waste of time Out looking for some burned-out pothead. What about the old lady? Guys, I mean, come on, aren't you at least gonna go, You know, talk to this woman? I mean, isn't it a felony to be growing marijuana? Well, it depends on the amount And if there's an intent to sell. Well, I mean, she's selling. Really? Did you buy some? No. You? Did you see her sell marijuana to anyone? No. Did you see any marijuana plants? 'cause you want us to bust a senior citizen For possession of a drug with intent to sell, But yet, you don't have any evidence. But manny said that she was... Sorry. What? Sorry, excuse me, Manny? Is that, like, the local drug dealer? No. 'cause if you wanna name names Or drop locations, then we might have something to talk about. I don't have anything to say. It's kind of what I thought. Let's go, hart. Hold on. Give us the old woman's address, okay. And if we get time We'll stop by, we'll ask a few questions, all right. Hart, you got to be kidding me. Now, let us know if he turns up, okay? You know, and if there's anything else you fine citizens need Please don't hesitate to call. Because, after all, we are here to serve and protect. Good night. See, they didn't care just like I said. So, what do you wanna do now? How is that shit? I killed a bumblebee today. How will we... Gangster! You! Yin and yang, What the fuck you all smoking? This amazing weed we got from manny. It's new, it's called black forest high. Manny said, he's dropping the other stuff. He did, huh? Yeah. Tastes like shit compared to this. Tastes like shit. Costs, like, twice the price. Fuck that. The high is like, twice as nice. Shut the fuck up. Give me the fucking joint. We came to the decision earlier today That we are not gonna be sharing any of the... Oh, yeah you will be sharing. Yeah, man, have a toke. Well, everyone does. Yeah, we all do. Give me all that shit. What? Empty your pockets of all that black forest shit. Maybe my boys won't fuck you up too bad. Huh. Where the fuck is manny? Our bad. Look here... - It tickles. - It tickles? I mean, I can tell.

So, why don't you hand it over. Come on, man, I actually sold out of all her weed, man. Her weed. Her weed. Her fucking weed. You sell her weed?

I got to give her something. Oh, you got to give her something. Why don't you give her that. You tell that fucking puta that she wants to push her shit on my turf She's gonna have to fucking pay like everybody else. This fucking shit, this ain't nothing but a down payment, bro. So, when she tells you or gives you some fucking lip, You look her dead in the fucking face and you tell her, Carlos said, "he's gonna come to your casa villa rasa "and fuck you up personally." Man, but she's just this little, sweet grandma, man. Oh, little grandma, little... I will eat that little, tiny thing like that. That's perfect, bro, the way I like them.

I got it, man, don't worry about it. It's cool, I'll tell her everything you told me. What the fuck are you still doing here? Ain't you a messenger boy, now? Yeah, yeah, I am. Fake little ass shit. That's what he said. Well, I hope he's got a really big dick. You just don't get it, do you? Carlos will hurt you. I've seen him and his homeys tear a guy apart for being short on his cash. Like, tear his ass apart. Blood and shit was everywhere. How many homeys? He could show up with like, four or five badass pendejos. Then I think I might, need you to help me. No. No, no you can't ask me to do that. See, carlos' got a long memory. He will hunt me down and he will eat me for breakfast. You know what I'm saying? Hmm. Sounds like my kind of man. Cookies?

No. No, it's not a good idea. Why not? Because she can have you arrested for harassment. I'm not harassing her. I'm... I'm investigating her. Oh, okay.

Aren't you that little guera who was all up in his grill the other day? Same one. Maybe you two should have taken me seriously. Yeah, you're right. I was thinking about going to the police... Don't bother. As soon as they see manny has a record they'll blow it off. "serve and protect" my ass! What do we do? I know where they are. But, it's gonna be dangerous. Definitely illegal. Somebody's gonna get hurt. The car's right here. We can't just go in there all guns blazing, bitch. We needs to case the place first. Find out if she's home or no. That kinda shit. Smart.

Once you're a day over 40 they think you got one foot already in the grave. Uh, you know I used to think that way, too. Until I dated my last boyfriend. And he was, like, 42, and I was like "dude, "you way too old for me" But, then he, like, bought me all these fly Clothes and took me to really fancy places like The cheesecake factory... And then I realized I could totally be into older guys. As long as they can still get it up. You know what I mean? Cause if you ain't getting dick, you ain't getting nothing. You know what I mean?
