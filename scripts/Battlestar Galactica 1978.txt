Some believe that there may yet|be brothers of man... who even now fight|to survive, far, far away|amongst the stars. Noble delegates, I realize you are all anxious|to get back to your ships... before our rendezvous|with the Cylons, but I think it appropriate|to toast... the most significant event|in the history of mankind. I would like to raise|my chalice... to you-- not merely|as the quorum of 12, representing|the 12 colonies of man, but as my friends-- the greatest leaders|ever assembled. As we approach|the seventh millennium of time, the human race at last|will find peace, thanks to you. [ All ]|Peace. Starbuck, he's comin'.|What are you gonna say? Zac, now just calm down.|Why are you so nervous? - He still thinks of me as his little brother.|- Well, you're acting like one. - It's just a routine patrol. Why is it so important to you?|- 'Cause it is. Look, I'm a warrior. I earned that.|I wanna prove that to him. I know, Zac, but this|may not be the best time. Well, it's a peace envoy.|What possible trouble could there be? - Well, that's not the point.|- Starbuck, you promised. - I know.|- Starbuck, what are you doin'? We're goin' on patrol. - Uh, uh, w--|- He can't make it. - Starbuck's not feeling well.|- Oh? Yeah, uh-- Well, it's, um--|I don't-- Well, that's, uh,|kinda short notice. I mean, with everybody|not wanting to go on this patrol-- everybody wants to celebrate|the armistice, uh-- I wonder who I'm gonna|be able to find. - Uh--|- Yes, uh, Zac. You have a suggestion? I've studied the coordinates|from here to the Cylon capital. My ship's ready to go. Well, that's lucky.|Isn't it, Starbuck? Yeah, that's a real|stroke of luck. Well, I guess you're just gonna have|to pull Starbuck's patrol with me. Wow! [ Laughing ] - Were we ever like that?|- I don't know. I can't remember that far back. Listen, uh, maybe|I ought to go along. No, he's gonna be just fine. I mean,|it's not as if we're at war, right? - See ya later.|- Okay. - Take care of the stomach.|- Yeah. I will. Section 12, launch bay alpha.|Stand by to launch fighter probe. Acknowledge input.|Recorded and functioning. [ Woman ] Vector coordinates|coded and transferred. - Acknowledge.|- Acknowledge. Ready to launch. Core systems transferring control|to probe craft. Launch when ready. - You forget how different it is out here.|- [ Apollo ] This is nothing. When the war is officially over, we may be|able to get back to deep star exploration. That's the challenge, Zac. Let's roll|over and take a look at the Lianus vector. Baltar, my friend, this armistice conference|would not have been possible... without your tireless work. You have secured for yourself|a place in the history books. That the Cylons chose me as|their liaison to the quorum of the 12... was an act of providence,|not skill. [ Chuckling ] I see the party is not a huge success|with all my children. What awaits us out there|is what troubles me. Oh, surely you don't cling|to your suspicions about the Cylons. They asked|for this armistice. - They want peace.|- Forgive me, Mr. President, but they hate us with every|fiber of their existence. We love freedom.|We love... independence-- to feel, to question,|to resist oppression. To them, it's an alien way of existing|they will never accept. But they have... through Baltar. They have sued for peace. Yes.|Of course you're right. Apollo, two targets on my scanner|just above the old moon Cimtar. Could be a storm. The fleet|will be coming right through it. You hold positions and cover me|while I take a look. I'm kicking in my turbos. - [ Apollo ] Well, look at that.|- [ Zac ] What is it? Tell ya in a flash. Warbook says a Cylon tanker.|Scanner reads it's empty. I have a funny feeling|about this. Well, we came to look. There's the other ship,|tucked in nice and neat. I wonder what she's doin'. [ Beeping ] I can't read anything inside.|She's jamming us. -[ Zac ] Warbook says she's a freighter.|-My foot. If she's jamming us, she's hiding|something. I'm going 'round her. Nothing but a harmless mist. Not heavy at all. I don't see why they'd send up|all that electronic jamming. - Let's get out of here.|- Why? [ Apollo ]|I'll explain later. Colonial Viper in quadrant.|Intercepting. I see what you mean. It's an ambush, and they've got enough|firepower to destroy the entire fleet. They're jamming transmission. We're not|gonna make it giving them our backs. - How many of 'em can you make out?|- Four. When I hit three, you hit reverse|thrusters and maximum breaking flaps. We'll give 'em a little surprise.|One, two, three! Turbos firm forward thrust now. Right here, you creeps! Not bad,|little brother. Okay. You go after the guys|on the right. - Yahoo!|- Apollo, I'll get this one. Zac, look out behind you! - I can't lose him! He's right on my tail!|- Hang on. I'm coming. - Steady.|- Hurry, Apollo! Steady. Nice shooting,|but they hit my high engine. That's okay, little brother.|We got all of 'em. No way those guys can outfight us|without a ten-to-one margin. Apollo...|better look at your scanner. No, but a thousand to one--|that's not fair. - What's it mean?|- It means there isn't going to be any peace. There may not be much of anything|if we don't warn the fleet. Do it. I'm short an engine. You know|I won't be able to keep up with ya. - Zac, I'm not gonna leave you.|- You have to. I'm puttin' my foot in that turbo.|I'll make it back ahead of 'em. Now go on. You gotta warn the fleet.|I'll be all right. You can fly with me anytime,|little brother. Good luck. Galactica control, this is|Commander Adama returning from Atlantia. - Request permission to land.|- [ Woman ] Permission granted. Something's wrong. - What is it?|- I don't know. They just put the ship on alert. [ Woman ] Atlantia, this is Galactica|core control. Request assistance-- Colonel,|what's been happening? Our patrol ran into trouble. We picked|up some signals, but they're being jammed. Could be smugglers|or pirates or-- - [ Woman ] Standing by.|- Get me the president, please. [ Adama ] Mr. President,|our patrol is under attack. We don't know by whom. As a precautionary measure, I would|like to launch intercept fighters. I should think that's highly inadvisable,|in view of the delicacy of our situation. You're quite right, Baltar. Commander, as a precautionary measure,|I insist upon restraint. If this turns out to be an encounter|with some outlaw traffic, we could jeopardize|the whole cause of peace... by displaying fighters when we|are so close to our rendezvous. Mr. President, two of my starfighters|are under armed attack. By forces unknown. You are not to launch until|the situation is more clear. Sir, may I at least urge you|to bring the fleet to a state of alert? I will consider that.|Thank you, Commander. He'll consider it.|He'll consider it? - It's all right.|- I'm sorry, Commander. It's just that-- - Well what?|- The patrol is under the command of Captain Apollo. Well, if I can't have confidence|in my firstborn son, whom can I depend upon? Commander,|Zac is with him. It's his first patrol. Thank you. [ Engine Sputtering ] - [ Engine Continues Sputtering ]|- Come on, baby. Give me all you got. Still no word|from our fighters, sir. Their transmission is being deliberately|jammed. If we don't launch-- We cannot launch.|It's been expressly forbidden. However, this might be a very good time|for battle stations drill. - Sound the alert, Colonel.|- Yes, sir. You may never see|another one, fellas. - A perfect pyramid.|- [ Whistling, Chattering ] Unless there's a better hand,|the pot's mine. [ Chattering, Laughing ] - [ Alarm Sounds ]|- Unfortunately, we'll have to finish later! - [ Man ] Another time.|- No! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Hey, wait a minute!|Wait! Wait! Wait! - [ Starbuck ] Hey, come back!|- Duty calls. [ Alarm, Chattering Continue ] [ Man ] Oh, come on!|Come on! Come on! Sir, our long-range scanner... shows a large number of ships|headed this way at high speed. A single patrol craft|is approaching, Commander. Get that pilot here as soon as he lands.|Get me the president. - What's goin' on?|- Nothing to worry about. Probably some kind of aerial salute for|the president while he signs the armistice. It sure ruined|a good card game. - Commander?|- Mr. President. A wall of unidentified craft|is closing in on the fleet. Possibly a Cylon|welcoming committee. Sir, may I suggest we launch|a welcoming committee of our own? Mr. President, there remain many|hostile feelings amongst our warriors. The likelihood|of an unfortunate incident... with all those pilots|in the sky at once? Commander? Sir, did Count Baltar suggest that our|forces sit here totally defenseless? My friend,|we are on a peace mission-- the first peace man has known|in a thousand years. [ Engine Sputtering ] Stand by to attack. Come on, baby.|Not much farther. Blue Flag 2 in trouble.|Request emergency approach. - Mr. President--|- Commander, one of our patrol ships is under attack|from main force approaching the fleet. Mr. President, your welcoming committee|is firing at our patrol. Baltar. Baltar? [ Sighs ]|We made it. [ Zac ] Patrol to fleet!|Patrol to fleet! I need help! What was that? That was my son,|Mr. President. [ Crying ]|No. Oh, my God. Positive shield now.|Launch fighters. - All batteries commence fire.|- [ Man ] All fire control stations... manned and operational. [ Woman ]|Launch all remaining Vipers. - Sir, they're off.|- Fighters launched, sir. - Were the other ships able to launch their fighters?|- Negative, sir. - [ Laser Fire ]|- Lord help us. [ Man ] Engineering reports|laser hits on starboard 8-8-7. Cylons. It was an ambush.|I had to leave Zac. - He's disabled. I'd like to go back and lead him in.|- That won't be possible. I didn't know what else to do. If I|don't go back, he doesn't stand a chance! Atlantia to all battlestars, we are|under attack. Repeat, under attack. - Zac?|- His ship was destroyed just short of the fleet. Transferring target scanners|to deck seven. Battlestar Atlantia|losing speed. [ Man ] Must renew speed three points|to maintain position with Atlantia. Hey, heads up, Boomer.|There's a pair on your tail. Pull up, Boomer.|I'll try to get him off! Nice shootin'! Captain, we have to know how many|base ships we're dealing with. - No base ships.|- You must be mistaken, Captain. Fighters couldn't function|this far from Cylon without base ships. - They don't carry enough fuel.|- Just fighters-- maybe a thousand. How do you account|for that, Apollo? I don't know. We picked up|an empty tanker on our scanner. It's my guess the Cylons used it|to refuel for the attack... after flying to that point|from wherever their base ships are. Why operate this far from Cylon without|base ships when it isn't necessary? They would have been|well out of our range at the old moon. Unless it was necessary... for them to be|somewhere else. Get me the president! Hey, Starbuck,|it's dangerous around here. Mr. President, I request|permission to leave the fleet. I have reason to suspect our|home planets may face imminent attack. - [ Woman ] Atlantia to all battlestars.|- Maintain contact. Fire's out of control.|Request Vipers. [ Sobbing ] How could I|have been so completely wrong? I have led the entire|human race to ruin. Mr. President. [ Screaming ] Group three,|vectors 1-7 and 2-8. Arm and attack Atlantia. [ Screaming ] - I got him on the left.|- I got him on the right. Atlantia death squadron,|attack! [ Man Chattering ] - Negative field now.|- [ Woman ] Emergency power to guns eight through twelve. - [ Woman ] My God, the ship--|- [ Man ] Get back to your post now. Oh, my God. Commander, our long-range scanners|have picked up Cylon base ships-- at grid 0-3-5, 1-2-6 and 2-5-8. That puts them well within|striking range... of the planets Virgon,|Sagittara and-- Yes, and Caprica. By your command. Speak, Centurian. All base ships|are now in range... to attack the colonies. The final annihilation|of the life-form known as man. Let the attack begin. Helm, bring us around. We're withdrawing. - Flank speed for home.|- [ Woman ] Request shuttles too. [ Laser Fire ] Commander,|the long-range scanner... picks up wave after wave of small ships|headed towards all inner planets. [ Chattering ] [ Man ]|Let's get out of here! - Get out! Come on!|- [ Chattering Continues ] Boxey! [ Screaming ] Look out! Boxey! [ Screams ] [ Screaming,|Chattering Continue ] Please, miss. The building's gonna|topple! Everybody, run for cover! Run! Run! Hurry!|Find cover! Get out of here! Stay down here! Down! Down! [ Barking ] - My daggit! My daggit! Where is he?|- He's fine! [ Yelps ] It's gonna be all right. [ TV Reporter ] Reaching on a broad|front from the lakes to the peninsula. Thirty-one cities are known|to be under heavy attack. - [ Continues, Indistinct ]|- [ Man ] I'm dying here! People running on fire! I can't tell you what it's like.|I'm all alone here. - I can't reach anyone.|- ...reports devastation throughout the mainland. Call X-B-31-91. [ Man ] This is the most terrible thing|I've ever witnessed. [ Man ] Red one-three-niner,|we're on fire! Emergency!|Fire in red 1-3. [ Woman ] There are hundreds of fires.|A sea of fire. The water supply is cut off.|There is no water! I'm told the death toll|is in the hundreds-- [ Man ] No, sir, I cannot!|My orders are to cover the relay. [ Woman ]|The central area is under attack. A second wave is coming in!|We have no defenses! Is anyone on this channel? Is this channel operative?|Do any of these channels work? - [ Crying ]|- [ TV Reporters Continue, Indistinct ] Oh, Zac!|And all the others! They trusted us to protect them,|and we-- Oh! There really wasn't|any choice. Commander, Cylon base ships|on long-range scanner... launching|to all outer planets. No hope, Commander. What about Sagittara? Planet's in flames,|Commander. Have my shuttle craft|prepared, please. Shuttle craft? I'm going down|on the surface of Caprica. That is out of the question. If|the Cylon scanners should pick you up-- You will continue to rendezvous|with the survivors of the fleet. I'll take you in my fighter. You're the|last surviving member of the council. If we should run into a Cylon attack|ship, at least you'll have a chance. I insist on that,|Commander. Very well. Core systems transferring control|to probe craft. Launch when ready. Ships are coming in|on both decks, sir. [ Tigh ]|What's the count? 67 fighters in all, sir.|25 of our own. How many battlestars? - None.|- What? We're the only surviving|battlestar. My God. Red Leader One in trouble.|Repeat, in trouble. We read you, Red Leader.|How can we assist you? I'm battle-damaged. Power control|circuits shot away in my landing gear. I'm on the line, Starbuck.|What's your condition? This is no time|for trainees, Athena. I'm in trouble.|I mean, I'm in real trouble. You will be if you keep|talking like that. - [ Athena ] How's your fuel?|- Dry. All right.|Run the check with me. Alpha circuit. Close and alternate|to left servo circuit. Alpha circuit closed.|Alternating to left servo circuit. No response.|My throttles are still full open. [ Keyboard Clicking ] Omega C circuit. Close and alternate|to servo support circuit. Alternating|to servo support circuit. Does not respond. Bring him in full throttle with shutdown|at the outer marker. There's no choice. I heard him. Get everyone out of the way.|I'm comin' in hot! [ Man ]|You're cleared to land. Roger. I hope you guys aren't|countin' off for neatness. He'll be coming in|like a missile. Stay back!|He could lose it! I told you to stay back! - [ Athena ] Starbuck!|- [ Man ] Get out fast! The ship might blow any minute! - Are you all right?|- Fine. Fine. No thanks to your father. Here.|Give it a good wash, fellas. Get under that wing.|Blow that out! Get that fire there! What are you saying|about my father? - Do you realize what we've just been through?|- Oh, yeah? You should have seen|how we spent our day. I managed to single-handedly keep the Cylons|off your neck while you took a little cruise! - Don't you realize what's happened?|- Oh, yeah. Sure. You should see this baby from the air|when it takes off across the sky. It's a beautiful sight,|unless it happens to be your base ship. Starbuck, listen to me! The colonies are gone. - All of them.|- What are you talking about, gone? I'm sorry, lla. I was never there|when it mattered. Never. - [ Chattering ]|- [ Man ] Wait a minute. - [ Chattering Continues ]|- [ Man ] This way. - [ Man ] There must be food somewhere.|- [ Man ] I'm hungry. [ Apollo ]|Father? There are crowds coming.|They probably saw our ship land. I was just g-gathering|a few things here. - This likeness of you and Zac--|- Father, we can't stay. Maybe Mother wasn't here. No. No, she was here. She was here. [ Chattering Continues ] Where were they? [ All ]|Yeah! Where were they? Where were the rest|of you fancy flyers? Where were you when they killed the rest|of us? What were you doin', boy? Wait! Wait!|Let him talk. I want to know where you were as well.|All of you. We waited. We watched and prayed,|and you never came. Most of us are dead. - The fleet is all but destroyed.|- But you're here. - From the battlestar Galactica.|- It survives? Yes. What of the president|and the Council of 12... and all the other colonies? [ Adama ]|All destroyed. - Commander Adama.|- Yes, Serina. It's true then.|We are defeated, doomed. Can I ride|in your ship, sir? Fighter planes|are no place for little boys. They're going to have to be|if our people are going to survive. We must fight back. Yes, we are|going to fight back. But not here. Not now.|Not in the colonies. Not even|in this star system. Let the word go forth to every man, woman|and child who survived this holocaust. Tell them to set sail at once in every|assorted vehicle that will carry them. [ Adama ] And the word went forth|to every outpost of human existence. And they came--|the Aires, the Gemins, the Virgos, the Scorpios, the Piceans|and the Sagittarians. In all, 220 ships, representing every colony,|color and creed in the star system. [ Adama ] The human race|might have one more chance, but first it would have to survive|the alliance, the elements... and the unknown dark and sinister|threats that would lie ahead. Their destruction is complete. [ Centurian ] Our forces have taken|prisoners near the spacedrome. They tell of survivors|who escaped in ships. What ships? Hmph!|How far can they go? If a handful of survivors|did indeed escape, they would have neither fuel|nor food for a prolonged voyage. The information|is not complete. It is offered|in exchange for life. And what is the standing order|for humans from your imperious leader? Extermination. Then carry out your orders,|and if they exist, they're doomed. [ Adama ] We gather here as|representatives of each ship in our fleet... to answer|that single question: Where will we go? Our recorded history tells|us that we descended... from a mother civilization, a race that went out into space|to establish colonies. Those of us here|assembled now... represent the only known|surviving colonies, save one. A sister world,|far out in the universe, remembered to us only|through ancient writings. It is my intention to seek out|that remaining colony, that last outpost of humanity|in the whole universe. [ Serina ]|Commander Adama. This 13th colony,|this other world-- Where is it,|and what is it called? I wish I could tell you|that I know precisely where it is, but I can't. However, I do know that it lies|beyond our star system... in a galaxy|very much like our own, on a planet called... Earth. - Earth!|- [ All Murmuring ] Flight Leader 17|by your command. Report, Centurian,|on the final assault. On each of the 12 planets|a similar story is told... of a handful of ships|who escaped destruction... to rendezvous|with a warship. - What kind of warship?|- A battlestar called Galactica. Then go and seek out Baltar.|Tell him I am displeased. Tell him|I offer a choice. Deliver|the battlestar Galactica, or deliver his head. [ Starbuck ] This is Alpha shuttle|approaching freighter Gemini... for fleet damage|and supply survey. Please prepare to receive. It isn't the worst duty in the fleet,|asking a lot of questions. I hear they're sending some poor guys|from Beta section... crawling around on the outside of|an old skybus looking for a solium leak. Wonder how they missed us|for that detail. - [ Starbuck ] Excuse me, but--|- Shh! Would you mind telling us|what you're looking for? Solium leaks! - Bye!|- Halt! Apollo-- Captain, that stuff|is dangerous. These old ships|shouldn't even be flying. There really wasn't|much choice, was there? How many people did we leave behind|for lack of ships? Now, unless you're willing to volunteer|permanent assignment on this tub, you'll help survey each and every ship|in this fleet for damage, or I just might be tempted|to loan you guys out to Beta company. Just keep it up, old buddy.|You're gonna get us into real trouble. Ten thousand light-years|from nowhere, our planet's shot to pieces, people|starving, and I'm gonna get us in trouble? - Look, all I'm saying--|- What is the matter with you? I tell ya, may as well live for today.|We might not have many left. [ People Groaning,|Murmuring ] - [ Coughing ]|- [ Murmuring, Groaning Continue ] [ Woman ]|What's going on? [ Man ]|We want some food. - [ Coughing Continues ]|- [ Woman Sobbing ] Apollo. Yeah. I see it. - Where's the food?|- Everything's gonna be taken care of. - Just be patient.|- But we haven't had water in two days. - We will have food and water to you as soon as possible.|- But what's happening? Just give us a little water!|Can't you bring us some water? We just need|a little bit of water! [ Man ]|Where's the food? Why haven't we seen or heard|from anybody in two days? Please tell us|what's going on. - Have-- Have we been left behind?|- No, you haven't. Just be patient.|Your needs will be attended to. Just be glad you're alive. [ Speaking Gemonese ] [ Starbuck ]|What's she saying? It's Gemonese.|Boomer can translate. Boomer's tied up.|Anyone here can help? Does anyone here|understand Gemonese? -The woman said her husband is feverish.|-What's wrong with your arm? There are others|with greater need than I. Get her out of here. She should be jettisoned|with the dead. No place for refuse here. Feed her to the daggits. Dirty Socialator. It's a sin|to starve us... while the bureauticians luxuriate|in their private sanctuaries. - No one is in luxury, I can promise you that.|- No, you're lying. I saw it with my own eyes|aboard the Rising Star, before I was cast out and put here|among the bories of humanity. Come here. Core Control|is aware of the problem. Then I can tell them|food and water is on the way? - They are aware of the problem.|- What are you saying? There's something|you're not telling us. Relief is on the way.|You have my word as a warrior. [ Woman Shouts ]|Your word as a warrior? [ Laughing ] [ Apollo ]|I can't fault them for resenting us. They lost everything.|They have to blame someone. Core Command,|this is Alpha shuttle... requesting clarification|and food dispersal. Core Command, no information|available at this time. What are you talking about? I just|left a ship filled with starving people. What's going on? I'm sorry,|Shuttle Alpha. Core Command has no information|available at this time. [ Beeping ] Commander,|this is Colonel Tigh. It's starting. - [ Man Groaning, Shouting ]|- Something's wrong. What'd they tell you|when you called in the food shortage? Same thing they told you:|vague acknowledgement of the problem. [ Sighs ] [ Groaning,|Shouting Continue ] Boomer, I'm getting|an awful uneasy feeling. Why don't you just|give me your name, okay? - [ Groaning Continues ]|- It's all right. My name is Cassiopea. Cassiopea. - [ Beeping ]|- It's beautiful. It means "fairy queen,"|doesn't it? I think so. And designation? I'm designated|a Socialator. It's an honorable|profession, practiced with the blessings|of the elders for over 4,000 years. I didn't say anything. I was just curious about what all that|excitement was about back on the barge. That woman-- That woman is a member of the Otori sect|amongst the Gemonese. They don't believe in physical contact|between genders... except when sanctified|by the priests... during high worship|of the sun storm, which comes once|only every seven years. No wonder those little buggers|are such good card players. Core Command,|this is Alpha Shuttle. Changing course to rendezvous|starliner Rising Star. Shuttle will proceed on to Galactica|with patients for life station. Hey, what are you up to?|I-If you don't mind my asking, sir. I want to see what's at the bottom|of this conspiracy of silence. Passenger liner Rising Star, this is Sigma|Shuttle on fleet damage and supply survey. Prepare to receive. Contaminated? Weren't the provisions checked|before they were boarded? [ Jolly ]|For radiation, yes. There wasn't time to check|for pluton poisoning. Pluton breaks down|the structure of food. - All of this is worthless?|- We don't know that yet. Jolly, go through|every container. Chances are some of it was shielded|enough from the bombs to be saved. We went through three ships since|last night. It isn't looking good. Salvage anything you can.|Even small scraps will help. And what do we do|with the rest of it? Jettison it. Keep a lid|on the problem. People find out we haven't any food,|we're gonna have a mutiny on our hands. We're going up|to the second level. - [ Beeps ]|- Captain! - Yes?|- I heard that you'd come aboard. I wonder if I might|borrow you for a moment. - We're on an important survey for the commander right now.|- It won't take very long. Boomer,|go up to elite class, see if there's anything goin' on|we should be concerned about. You won't like|what you find. I'll be along|presently. It's my son. He hasn't moved|in two days. He lost a little daggit|which meant everything to him. I thought you might|be able to help. If he won't eat for you,|I don't know what I can do. He seemed to spark a little|when you picked him up on Caprica. I got the feeling|you were good with children. I grew up with a kid brother.|Where is he? - There.|- Oh. [ People Murmuring,|Groaning ] Excuse me. I'm in charge of finding young men|to try out as future fighter pilots. - Your name is?|- Boxey. Boxey.|Okay. [ Beeping ] Just what I thought.|You're right at the top of my list. I've been looking for you. You should|have made contact with the commander. - We're very short on fighter pilots.|- I'm too little to be a pilot. Oh, sure, right now, but how long do you think it takes|to become a full colonial warrior? I don't know. You have to start|when you're very small, or you won't get these|until you have gray hair. - You like them?|- I want Muffit. Well, there's not much room|for a daggit in a fighter plane. He's gone.|He ran away. Oh. Well, um, well, maybe we can find|one of Muffit's friends. I asked.|There are no daggits. Well,|I'll tell you what. As a colonial warrior,|first level, you are entitled to the first daggit|that comes along. But only on the condition|that you get your rest, close your eyes, eat all your primaries-- Shh. and stop|chasing girls. Thank you. I was right.|You are good with kids. You and your brother|must be very close. We were. Oh, I'm sorry, I-- - If you'd rather not be involved, I--|- Hey, don't be silly. What's a warrior to do after he's lost|the big one? Win a few of the little ones. That's not a little one|in there, Captain. No. - Genestress is a private accommodation...|- ...just once to step aside-- secured by Sire Uri|and his party. I'm being paid|by Transtellar-- Now... Hey, what's goin' on,|Boomer? Oh, oh, nothing. Just that the fella here didn't seem|to want to let us into the club area. - [ Beeps ]|- Thank you. [ Guests Laughing,|Chattering ] [ Whispers ]|Thank you. I trust you have an explanation|for this intrusion. Would you like to make a statement|before I arrest you, Sire Uri? [ Chuckles ]|I'm glad you know my name. At least you'll know|from where the blade fell. I'm gonna give you about a micron|to join me on my shuttle. After that, I'll just turn the six|levels of starving passengers loose... and let you take|your chances with them. Captain, why don't you join us in our|prayer of gratitude for deliverance. In case it eluded you,|Counselor, some hundred people have died|since our deliverance from the Cylons, and while hunger|hasn't yet taken a life, it's only|a matter of time now. Boomer, notify Core Command|that we have located some stores... which we will distribute|as far as they go. No, it's mine. It belongs to me|and my guests. Does your wife share your feelings|about denying your food to others? - My wife?|- Siress Uri. I don't see her. Unfortunately, she was not|in time to make the voyage. My sympathies.|I share your bereavement. Siress Uri|was an outstanding woman. Yes. I'm sure she'd be moved|by your period of mourning. Boomer, have Jolly come up here with a crew|and distribute this food throughout the ship. Without being critical,|Captain, wouldn't you say|you overplayed our hand just a tad, considering Sire Uri is a member|of the newly elected Council of the 12? How do you overplay|starvation? How's it feel? [ Cassiopea ] It feels like|it's never even been broken. The bone's|been fused whole. It's stronger than before. It's wonderful. - [ Sighs ]|- [ Groaning ] Look!|Look! Look.|Look at my arm! [ Laughs ] You're waiting to take me back,|aren't you? Well, it isn't easy|to find a ride around here. Oh, I dread|returning to that ship. Look, uh, maybe I can check around and|see if there's anyplace else you can go. There are|better ships. Would you be doing this|if I weren't a Socialator? Hey, listen, uh, can we forget my|little jokes back on the shuttle, huh? Look, I--|I just want to help you. Really. It was nothing personal. - Nothing personal?|- No. - Absolutely nothing.|- Really? I swear. [ Laughs ]|Okay. Okay. But I think you're|making a terrible deal. [ Laughing ] The long range patrol's|reporting in. Alta tech scanners show|no sign of Cylon pursuit. All vectors|looking good. - Commander.|- Yes, I heard. That's, uh, good news. Apparently|we've made good our escape. Finding us now|would be almost impossible, assuming we don't make|any mistakes. Carillon|is too far away. We will never make it|because of the food disaster. There is|no other destination. Ah, but there is. We can stop here, on Borallus. [ Men Murmuring ]|Borallus? We know that everything|we need is there-- food, fuel and water. And, undoubtedly,|a Cylon task force. It is the most logical place|for us to stop. Precisely why|it would be fatal. - H-H-Hey, where you goin'?|- [ Sire Uri ] Possibly fatal. Is it not surely fatal|to continue towards Carillon? There is another way, if I may have|a few moments of the Council's time. I support Commander Adama's|rejection of Borallus. Surprising. It is a death trap as lethal|as the one we left behind, and we haven't the armament|to fight our way in and out. However, there is another|approach to Carillon. Instead of using|the intended route, which takes us|centons out of our way, I suggest we take|the direct path here, through the Nova of Madagon. Not patrolled, and a savings|of centons in reaching Carillon. Captain, I may not be|a military expert, but I do know that the Cylons don't have|to patrol that particular area... because they mine it. They lay mines|to make passage impossible. [ Council Members|Murmuring ] A fleet of cumbersome ships|like ours, to even attempt to go through|that narrow passage-- I agree. The fleet could not|traverse the channel... unless it had been|cleared first. And how would you propose|doing that? Well, I suggest I find|one or two volunteers... to join me in flying|ahead of the fleet... to blow the minefield apart|with laser torpedoes. - Good idea.|- Two, uh, "volunteers." Out of the question.|Out of the question! Brilliant, brilliant. If we must go straight ahead, as you|insist, Adama, then this is the way. - I say we support the captain.|- [ Anton ] Good for you. My boy, as grave a plan as it is,|it appears to be our only hope. You have the support and the blessing|of the Council of the 12. Thank you. You wanna guess who he's got|in mind to volunteer for that-- -Hey, hey, wait.|-[ Whispering ] I'm getting out of here. Well, just the two fellas|I wanted to see. Follow me, gentlemen. [ Whispers ]|See? I told you. Right. He still won't eat. I think we may have found something|that's going to interest him. Tonight?|Shouldn't you be getting some rest? I'll sleep better after|we solve Boxey's problem. - That's a tall order.|- I'm a big boy. Okay, Boxey. You're gonna love this,|Boxey. As you know,|we will soon be landing... on various alien planets. It's important|that we be safe. Ordinarily, we'd use trained daggits|to stand watch at night... while our warriors slept|in their encampments, but we didn't have|any daggits... so we just had to see|what we could come up with. We'll call the first one|Muffit 2. - [ Electronic Bark ]|- [ Gears Whirring ] [ Electronic Barking ] [ Barking Continues ] [ Chuckles ] [ Purring ] Naturally, the first one will have|to be very carefully looked after. That's not Muffit. He's not even|a real daggit. No, but he can learn to be|like a real one. He's very smart. And if you would help us,|it will be even smarter. - Stop that.|- [ Moans ] We used the image of Boxey|you gave us... to train the drone|to respond to him. [ Bouncing Noise,|Gears Whirring ] I owe you one, Doc. Anytime. [ Laughing ] That's one I owe you. Call it even. [ Electronic Barking ] It's somehow|beautiful. - It's a perfect machine!|- [ Starbuck Chuckles ] [ Cassiopea Laughs ] [ Cassiopea ]|Born to dance amongst the stars. [ Starbuck ] Yeah, it's bumping|into them that has me worried. Why did you volunteer,|Starbuck? Well, somebody|had to do it. Did Apollo make you? Yes, uh,|you certainly have a way... of cutting through|the felgercarb. Do you ever take that smoldering weed|out of your mouth? [ Chuckles ] And I had this|wonderful speech all prepared. About this being|your last night here, about possibly not seeing another night|as beautiful as this one... or another girl as beautiful as I am|ever again. Yeah, well, that speech|is a little better than the one I had. Would you mind if I borrowed it|on some future occasion? Do you mind if we don't spend too much|more time in the launching bay? Can you think of anyplace|more private? Come to think of it, I can't think of|anyplace private in the whole damn fleet. Oh. - What's in there?|- That's the launching tube. You don't wanna go in there.|It's dark and cold and, uh-- [ Sighs ] Oh, Lord,|I'll do anything you ask tomorrow. Colonel, have you seen|Lieutenant Starbuck, by any chance? No, I don't think I-- Wait, I did|see him on one of the monitors earlier. Before we shut down the flight deck,|I think he was checking out a ship. That would|seem to make sense. I'm sure he's long gone by now, getting|a good night's sleep for the mission. Why don't you do the same.|You are going to be working. That little snake. [ Yelling ] [ Steam Hissing ] [ Yelling Continues ] The Nova of Madagon|is not a nova at all, but a star field so bright our cockpits|will be sealed to prevent blindness. We'll navigate by scanner and sweep|everything out of our path with turbo lasers. [ Clears Throat ] You feeling all right? You're fidgeting|around like a daggit on a sunspot. It's my bio-pulse line,|sir. It's a bad time for me|to be cooped up in a cockpit. Starbuck's|being polite. Seems he got|a steam burn. I don't wanna ask you how you got it,|because I need you on this mission. I didn't choose you to help lead us|through without a great deal of anguish. If it'll do any good, let me assure you|that should we fail, no one will survive. The rest of our friends must sit|in anticipation of our skill. Or lack thereof. - Ready?|- Ready. - [ Apollo ] Starbuck?|- Uh, I'm not ready, but let's get it over with. Nova star field ahead. [ Man On Radio ]|On three, two, one. We've got it. Radiation shield|positive. Launch fighters...|now! [ Computer ] Skin temperature|readout: 1-0-0 and rising. I may not be able to see anything,|but it's sure getting hot. Anybody picking up the field? Negative.|My scanner's burning up. - [ Boomer ] Mine's gone.|- [ Apollo ] It's too bright for the scanner. Core systems transferring control|from probe craft to Galactica. We will guide you through|using scanners. - What if we miss a mine?|- One of us will be the first to know. Let's go. [ Woman ]|We'll talk you through. [ Computer ] Countdown to fire--|five, four, three-- [ Computer ]|Three degrees right. - [ Computer ] Target destroyed.|- [ Sizzling ] - One target coming up.|- It's burning through my canopy! - Four, three, two, one, fire.|- [ Apollo ] Just keep firing. [ Computer ]|And fire. [ Computer ] Heartbeat,|Lieutenant Boomer, readout: 1-0-0. Other functions normal. It's working, Commander. They're clearing a path|a hundred maxims wide. Now, that|is precision flying. - I can't see a blessed thing. Are we hitting anything?|- Hanged if I know. [ Computer ]|Two, one, fire. [ Computer ] Heartbeat,|Captain Apollo, readout: 9-9. Skin temperature:|1-2-0 and still rising. Skin temperature:|1-3-0 and rising. - Five, four, three,|- It's getting hot. two, one, fire. Fire. Fire. [ Computer ] Heartbeat,|Captain Apollo, readout: 9-9. Skin temperature:|1-3-5 and slowly leveling off. [ Apollo ]|It's cooling off. - Heartbeat, Captain Apollo--|- Let's take a look at where we are. Negative shield now. There it is. Carillon. - I think we're gonna make it.|- Yee-haah! [ Voices Murmuring,|Chattering ] [ Cheering, Yelling ] [ Woman ]|We did it! Yes! [ Cheering Continues ] Recall the flight crews. [ Adama ]|The planet Carillon. Landing operations|will begin at once. Prepare to land the mineral ships|and the Landram parties. Our mineral scanners|have located... what we believe is the approximate site|of the old mining expedition. Blue Squadron will vector in|the ground search teams. Welcome, Baltar. I have grave news. A handful of colonials prevail, but we will soon find them. What of our bargain?|My colony was to be spared. I now alter the bargain. How can you change|one side of a bargain? When there|is no other side. You have missed|the entire point of the war. But I-I have no ambitions|against you. Could you think me so foolish|as to trust a man... who would see|his own race destroyed? Not destroyed.|Subjugated under me. There can be no survivors. So long as one human|remains alive, the alliance|is threatened. [ Chuckles ] S-S-Surely you--|y-you don't mean me. We thank you|for your help, Baltar. - Your time is at an end.|- No! You can't! You still need me--|Aaaah! Victor 6-3-0-3-8|to Ground Expedition 2. My scanners read life-forms|beyond these coordinates. Either it's some|high energy-yielding substance, or they left some kind of caretaker operation|behind when they abandoned this place. [ Boomer ]|We've got it, 0-3-8. I wonder what this|looks like in the daytime. Hey.|This is the daytime. Oh. Lovely. Landram 1|to Skywatch 0-3-8. Can you assist|in locating tylium mine? You got it, Captain. My scanner indicates that you are|vectored to intersect the mine area... in 24 millicentons. - [ Apollo ] Affirmative, 0-3-8.|- Everyone sync chronometers. Captain would like a check-in every four|millicentons on the emergency frequency. - Understood?|- Affirmative, Jolly. You are in time sync now. 0-3-8 returning to base.|See you guys in a while. Good luck. Boomer. Yeah, yeah,|what is it now? You're not gonna|believe this. [ Engine Stops ] I don't believe it. - What is it?|- I don't know. All right. [ Whispers ]|Okay, come on. - Boy, sure is pretty.|- [ Voices Chattering ] Sounds friendly. [ Laughing,|Chattering Continues ] Aaah! Don't shoot me!|What do you want? W-W-Wait.|Don't be afraid. Listen, uh--|Hey, you're from Taura. - I'm a Taurus. How do you know that?|- The, uh, dialect. Listen, uh,|what is this place? - What are you doing here?|- What are you doing here? Colonial warriors sneaking around a|resort like this with your weapons drawn. - Oh, uh, sorry.|- This is legal! Isn't it? Well, uh,|how did you get here? -Oh! I came in a skybus.|-She must have been smoking plant vapor. - [ Laughing, Chattering Continue ]|- Hey, wait, wait, listen. Could you, uh, tell us|something about this bus? My travelator took care of all of it.|Isn't it fabulous here? All this|for so little money. Oh, and I just won a thousand--|over a thousand cubits. - Isn't that amazing?|- You won those cubits here? Oh, in here|everybody's doing it. It's incredible. You know, if it's illegal you're gonna|have to fight the whole star system. I have to go!|[ Laughs ] I have a moonlight cruise. Two moons.|Oh, how can you go wrong? [ Laughing, Chattering, Screaming ] [ Boomer ] I don't get it.|How cut off can these people be? She didn't act like she'd even heard|about the destruction of the colonies. There's something|even more peculiar. Why haven't we heard|about this place? I suppose you know every gambling|chancery in this star system, huh? Oh, that's right.|That's right. If there's a game going on,|you'd know about it. -- [ Pop ] [ Woman Screaming|Excitedly ] - Whoo-hoo!|- Whoo! - Whoo!|- [ Cheering ] The odds|must be incredible here. People are winning|a fortune. Yes, and they're|obviously well-fed. Look, why don't we find out|about who's in charge of this place... and see about getting some food|back up to the fleet. The last thing these people may want is|a battlestar sitting on their front door. I haven't found|a gambling den yet... that didn't depend on military|pay vouchers to keep its doors open. Now, Boomer, until we find out|who these people are, just remember,|it'll only take one informer, and we'll have the whole|Cylon war machine on its way. [ Starbuck ] I wanna look around,|sit in on a game or two, see if I can find out|what's behind this place. [ Excited Squealing,|Hooting ] Your mission, Boxey, is|to keep your eye on that readout. When the counter gets up to 10, it means|we're right on top of a rich tylium deposit. Yes, sir. - It don't matter|where you go - - We'd better talk.|- Right. - Something's|always after you - - - It's love - -|- Love - - - Love - - - It's love - -|- Love - - - Love - - - It's love - -|- Love - - - Love - - - Love -|- They can't read our lips in here. - Who?|- Whoever might be up to something in this place. Well, Boomer, one thing|this place isn't is crooked. Where'd you get|all those cubits? Gambling. I'm telling you, Boomer,|you can't lose. That's what|I'm talkin' about. You ever been in a gambling chancery|where you couldn't lose? No, but then I've never|been here before either. -- [ Continues ] - It don't matter|where you go - - It won't matter|what you do - - 'Cause something's|always after you - We could make a fortune if we|put those girls on the star circuit. I mean, big money, Boomer.|Big money. - Big money, huh?|- Yeah. Every creature in the universe|is out to exterminate us, and you wanna hire|a vocal group. - Mm-hmm. - I'm telling you, there's|something just not right about this place. - - It's love - -|- Love - - - Love - - - It's love - -|- Love - - - Love - - - It's love - -|- Love - - - Love - - Love, Love - [ Bass Tone ]|- Love -- Yeah, I gotta talk|to those girls. - [ Gears Whirring, Clanking ]|- Quiet, Muffit. - [ Monitor Beeping ]|- I see it. Tylium. - Nice going, Boxey.|- [ Jolly ] That's a pretty hot reading. We may be right on top of that old mine.|I'd better check it out. - [ Gears Continue Whirring ]|- Okay, Jolly, keep your eyes open. [ Whirring,|Electronic Barking ] - I'll bring him back.|- Hey, Boxey! Boxey, wait right here.|I'm gonna get him back. Muffy? Muffy? - Thank you.|- For what? For saving|my son's life. You're getting things|a little out of proportion. In a way, maybe|I should be thanking you. You don't know anything|about me... or what happened|to Boxey's father or-- When you're ready,|you'll tell me. In the meantime, nothing that's|gone on before really counts for much. As far as|the human race is concerned, we're all starting over. Muffy? Muffy? Muffy? [ Loud Clank ] Muffy? Muffy! Darn you, daggit,|where are you? Muffy! Muffy? Muffy? Muffy? [ Gasps ]|Aah-- [ Footsteps Approaching ] - Any sign of Boxey?|- I'm afraid not. What is it? - What's happening on this planet?|- I don't know. [ Apollo ] This may be the largest|tylium mine in the star system. [ Serina ] I don't care. I just|want to know what's happened to Boxey. -- [ Harp ] - [ Squeaking Language ]|- [ Computer, Translating ] Welcome to Carillon. - You are impressed?|- [ Apollo ] Confused would be more like it. - Listen, we've lost a little boy.|- [ Squeaking Language ] [ Translating ]|He is safe. - We found him and brought him here.|- [ Squeaking Language ] - Would you care to join him?|- Yes, we would. Mommy! [ Chuckles ] Captain,|good fortune smiles on us. Yeah, it's like nothing|we ever dreamed of, Captain. They've got everything we need here,|plenty of it, and they're happy to share. Sounds like paradise. Yeah, it does. Colonel, a message|from Sire Uri. [ Tigh Reading ] [ Adama Reading ] "...within a centon." Well, Colonel, a most optimistic note. Too optimistic. Uri has everyone in the fleet breaking in|the bulkheads to get down to the surface. Well, perhaps in small numbers,|in orderly rotation. It isn't going to be|that way. Already he's authorized|visitors permits to half our population. Half the population? [ Adama ]|We've come so far, so quickly. There's been little time|for reason. What is the curious secret|behind the existence of this outpost... on the outer rim|of our star system? There are many such oases|for intergalactic travelers, but none so far off|the known arteries of trade... and none so curiously close|to a tylium mine. Fuel has begun to arrive|from the Ovion mines, but in curiously small|quantities. And now I feeling|the growing need... for extraordinary measures|of precaution. The ships continue to hover|over the planet, supported by|small maintenance crews... whose spirits are as depleted|as their numbers. Everyone seems to have forgotten|our flight from the Cylons. The beauty and wiles|of Carillon... hold our people spellbound. -- [ Disco ] Let 'em ride. Hello, Starbuck. This is my lucky night. Just might be. Yeah, well,|money isn't everything. - No?|- Mm-mmm. Um, listen, have you checked out|the accommodations yet? Most of my unit is staying|down on Carillon tonight. I'll see|what I can arrange. Oh, really?|Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Are you going to play, sir?|- Oh, I hope so. Hmm?|Oh! Uh, yeah, sure. Let 'em ride again.|It's my lucky night. Yeah. - [ Cheering ]|- Can't lose. Is this seat taken? Oh, uh, uh, well,|it's, um, um, um-- - Starbuck?|- Yeah? - I became because I owe you an apology.|- You do? Come on.|This paradise? It's the perfect opportunity|for us to be... open and honest|with one another. - Yeah.|- I hurt you. Admit it. Well, it-- w-- Didn't you|once tell me... I was the only woman you'd ever had|any real and deep feelings toward? Yeah,|I may have said that. - You may have said that?|- No, uh-- A-Athena, wait, wait.|What I-- What I meant to say is, I've had to shut all those feelings|out of my mind... to avoid any more pain|than I've already suffered. - Hmm?|- [ Laughs ] Starbuck. [ Starbuck ]|Oh, no. Hello. Excuse me. I believe|you're occupying my space. - Your space?|- Yes. I have good news. - Huh?|- I got us the key to the royal suite. Why, thank you.|We do appreciate it. Uh, say, listen, girls.|I've got this hot streak going here. - Oh, I see.|- Yes, I do too. Well, have a good time, you two. And next time,|it's at office rates, Lieutenant. Never eaten so much|in my entire life. [ Laughs ]|I'm gonna be as fat as a pig. Push level three for us,|please. I feel like a total glutton, Answaw.|Nothing fits me anymore. And we've only been down|on the surface for three-- Um, I asked you|to push the third level. You've missed our lodging. I did press it.|Something seems to be wrong. Well, there are no lodgings|this far down. Look there! It seems to be taking us|all the way to the bottom. - Something seems to be happening.|- Let me at that control. There. We've stopped.|Thank goodness. I wonder what's down here. [ Screaming ] What is the purpose|of this special council? Adama, I'm afraid|I must ask you... to respect the order of business|until called upon by this chair. I think Counselor Uri has|a measure to propose. Thank you. My brothers, a hasty attempt|to outrun the Cylons... spawned in the midnight|of desperation... seems foolhardy|in the light of day. I propose, instead, we now attempt|to appeal for justice and mercy. Justice?|Justice from the Cylons? Is that what|you actually said? Gentlemen,|they've told us... that they would not stop until|every human had been exterminated. Now, why should they believe|we are now willing to accept... that which we have always|found to be unacceptable? To live under Cylon rule? Because we would destroy|our arms... to prove we're willing|to live in peace. - Destroy our only means of defense?|- Or attack. May I remind my brothers... that we did not have|conflict with the Cylons... until we intervened in their relations|with other nations. Yes.|Yes, you are right. We did not come into conflict|with the Cylons... until we helped our neighbors|whom the Cylons wished to enslave, and until we helped the Hasaries|get back their nation, taken by force|by the Cylons. Correct. But if we|mind our own business, there's every reason to believe|that the Cylons will leave us alone. If you've all come to this|council to turn your backs... on the principles of our fathers|and the Lords of Kobol... from whom|all colonies evolved, you do so|with my utter contempt. Warriors are always the last to|recognize the inevitability of change. We have a choice:|life or death. I submit that an issue this grave|should be decided by our people. Maybe you're right.|But I'll tell you something. The military|won't be easy to convince. How, may I ask, do you propose to|present such a delicate matter, eh? At a celebration... to decorate those three|brave young men... who led us to safety through|the perilous straits of Madagon. One of them Adama's son,|I do believe. Just the tonic our people|need at this moment. Some old-fashioned,|down-to-goodness heroes. [ Chuckles ] [ Chattering, Shouting ] - After you.|- Thank you. Party's just gettin' started. Do you want a little,|uh, company? I'm kinda companied out.|Thank you. You're gonna miss the tribute|for the three warriors. I've given 'em all the tribute|they're gonna get. [ Sighs ]|We missed my level. Mine too.|Something seems to be wrong. We're going|all the way down. I didn't think that was allowed.|I wonder what's down there. [ Screaming ] Help me! What are they|doing with us? Okay, 30-70. You guys split 70 percent, and I'll|even pick up the transportation. I just don't think|it'll work out. Well, why not? - Look, I can't talk now.|- What do you mean? We'll just have to talk about it|later... if you're still around. Hey, hey, wait!|Where you goin'? - You're my meal ticket out of the military.|- Starbuck! What are you doing? The captain's|been lookin' all over for you. You know, Boomer, I'm beginning to agree|with you. Something's goin' on here. Well, whatever it is, it's gonna|have to wait. We've gotta get back. - Uh, what for?|- Dress uniform. - Wait. I'm not gettin' into any fancy--|- Uh, uh, uh, uh. One does not accept|our people's highest military honor, the Gold Cluster,|in a battle suit. - The Gold Cluster? Ah, you're kidding.|- We got it. Commander? Commander. Just like old times,|isn't it, Tigh? Well, our ships weren't quite so fancy,|but we gave them a good run. Yes. You didn't tell|anyone we were meeting? - No.|- Good. Is there some reason why you and I|aren't supposed to be talking? Pick up that|ground crew communicator... and climb into|the next ship, please. - Climb into the next ship?|- Quickly. You're patched into|my internal com system. We are completely isolated.|No one can hear us. Yes. I understand.|But why would anyone want to? It grieves me to think that we have to|take such precautions on our own battlestar. Sire Uri's men|are expecting me... to make some kind of move|over his disarmament plan. I find that even my private quarters|are being monitored. Now, what I'm about to propose|is somewhat risky. You don't have to go along|if you don't want to. Commander, if you think we should do it,|naturally I say we should do it. What is it|we're about to do? Tigh, when would be... the most devastating time|for a Cylon strike? Almost anytime.|With half of our warriors down on-- During the celebration, when all|of our warriors are down on Carillon. If we were attacked... without being able|to recall our warriors, we wouldn't have a chance. A few well-placed Cylon bombs... in the heart|of this launching bay... and we wouldn't be able to get|a single fighter into the air. Then, you do think there's more|to Carillon than generosity? It smells like a trap. It feels like a trap. I believe it is a trap. It is imperative... that we get our pilots|closer to our ships. Or perhaps|the other way around-- get our ships|closer to our pilots. How do we get our fighter ships down to|Carillon without getting council clearance? Well, we'll launch|a couple at a time... as if they were part|of our regular patrol. The council has ordered all|of our warriors to be at the party. They will be there,|in a manner of speaking. Now, Uri doesn't know|all of our warriors on sight. He'll be counting|uniforms, not men. He'll be counting uniforms? Yes.|I want you to collect... all the warrior uniforms|you can possibly lay your hands on... and fill them with|whomever you can find-- mechanics,|kitchen personnel, anyone-- and get them|down to that party. - What do I tell them?|- Tell them anything. Tell them they're on a secret mission,|which is the truth. I'll do my best. I'm depending upon you,|Tigh. If I'm right, Uri won't be the only one who'll be|counting uniforms at that party tonight. I understand,|and I hope you are wrong. Well, we'll see. [ Coins Clattering On Floor ] - What are you doing, Colonel?|- [ Gasps ] Felger-- I, uh, didn't mean|to startle you. Can we, uh,|give you a hand with-- If you ever do that again,|you're on report, Starbuck! You can tell the rest|of your playboy pilots... this is not the last flash inspection|that I'm gonna make. If I ever find uniforms|in this condition, you're in trouble. When Commander Adama sees these,|he's gonna go crazy. It's gotta be the pressure. You know, it's unfair. A lot of those bridge|officers never go down to the surface... while everybody else gets to go|and have a good time. Bridge officers don't get their tails|shot off flying around in little fighters. Still, I wouldn't mind|trading with them. I believe you.|I'll mention it to the colonel. Wait a minute. I can't take over|for him. I'm not a colonel. Neither am I. So much for guilt.|Let's go to the party. Right. Hello, Father. Apollo. Well, uh, Colonel Tigh wants to be|at the celebration, so I, uh-- I offered to|relieve him for the night. Simply as a favor. I might have thought you'd like to see|your son getting his Star Cluster. It's well-deserved, Apollo.|Well-deserved. Precisely why I cannot accept it as anything|but another one of Counselor Uri's ploys. How can saluting his greatest|rival's son be a ploy? I just have the feeling that he'll|propose destroying our arms... at the celebration, hoping that|the cascade of emotion... will do all the damage before|anyone realizes what they've done. - But you can stop it.|- I? [ Laughs ] Not anymore. Have you heard the talk?|I got us into this predicament. No one believes that. And even|if some do, you have to speak out. How can I say to you that you've|been more than a father to me? You've been someone I could look up to|with trust and respect. My ideals rise and fall|on your standards, and this isn't you. What's happening to you?|Help me to understand. You'll understand, my son.|In time, you'll understand. I know that wasn't easy for you, not|telling him. Perhaps you should have. No. No. If I told him, I wouldn't have|been able to keep him from my side. This is my gamble.|If I win, we all win. But if you're wrong,|Uri will destroy you. I'm not wrong. The Cylons lured me|into their deception once. Never again. [ Chattering ] - That's very strange.|- What is? That man's insignia|is Blue Squadron. I thought I knew everybody in it,|and look at the fit of that uniform. Apollo, tonight|is a night of thanksgiving, and everyone's dressing up|and making do with whatever they have. He probably hasn't|worn that in years. Besides, the guest of honor|looks absolutely delicious. [ Chattering Continues ] - Hi.|- How lovely you look in your uniform. Huh? Oh. Hey, isn't this|something, Boxey? - Our hosts have been very generous.|- I don't like them. - What?|- I told him the Ovions wouldn't approve of him... bringing Muffit|to the celebration. Well, we put one over|on them, didn't we? Except for your captain, I deduce from the uniforms|that most of your warriors are here. - Yes, well, I'm always a big draw.|- [ Laughs ] [ Growls ] Muffit, Muffit, come back here!|Here, daggit! Come back here! - Starbuck.|- Yes? What is it? I'm talking to the great|and near great. Well, when you come down,|tell me who that is. Those three guys|right behind the dancer. Darned if I know.|They sure have lousy tailors. - Starbuck, you should know them.|- Why should I know them? Because they're wearing|the insignia from our squadron. Don't start without me. Where is the lieutenant going? - Um, to find the captain, sir.|- Excellent. [ Apollo ]|Hey, what's going on? - Stop those guys. Stop them.|- What are you-- What are you doing, Starbuck? Listen, something's|going on around here. Those three impostors, I just--|Uh, listen, can we talk? Yeah.|Will you excuse us? The lieutenant|needs attention. I'll take Boxey and get something|to eat. Where is Boxey? He's probably in watching the acrobats.|They're pretty good. Well, don't be long. You two don't|want to miss your own coronation. - Yeah.|- Boxey! - What's this about impostors?|- I don't know. I've been running into guys all night|who aren't from our unit, but they're wearing|our unit's clothes. - That officer in the shuttle.|- You spotted one of them? Yeah, maybe.|I think we better check this out. I suggest that you find|your two friends... and tell them that we're going to begin,|with or without them. Yes, sir. - Looks deserted.|- Everyone's at the party. Not everyone. There are three|impostors down here someplace. [ Squeaking Language ] How many warriors? Nearly their full|complement of warriors. See that the humans remain|entertained until the end, then they will be yours|in the lower chambers. This night we celebrate|a most special event... in the annals|of human experience. Starbuck, what'd you find? They're not here.|They must be at another level. The other levels|aren't accessible to humans. - I've been wondering about that.|- Yeah, so have I. I know how to fix that problem.|Stand back. You're the gambler.|Pick a level. Uh, what say we have a look at what's|furthest from the guest rooms? - Mmm, nice.|- Shhh! Mm-mmm.|You're the leader. ...against any living brother,|whether a former friend or foe. [ Electronic Barking ] - Muffit! - At least he'll|be remembered in the eons as-- [ Woman Moaning ] Ah, me and my big mouth. At least we know|the secret of Carillon. Do we? What's the connection|between the casino and all this? Let's get out of here,|then figure that one out. Muffit! Run, Boxey, run! Apollo, are you thinking|what I'm thinking? With all this tylium, we're setting fire|to the biggest bomb in the universe. Yeah. - It's a little late to try and talk to these fellows.|- I think so. [ People Moaning ] [ Moaning Continues ] Oh, my God! Some of them are probably|from our ships. [ Starbuck ] No wonder no one's ever|left here to tell about this resort. The Ovions are living|off of them... and probably selling|the tylium they mine to the Cylons. - That's Muffit!|- Hey, Boxey, come back here! No!|[ Groaning ] Muffit! Muffit! [ Screams ]|Starbuck! [ Sobbing ] Let's go!|Follow me! Report, Centurian. It is done,|Imperious Leader. Let the attack begin. By your command,|Imperious Leader. [ Barking ] We're doing fine!|Whoops. - There's too many of them.|- Go for the ceilings. Set fire to the tylium. That must be|why you're a captain. Call out the entire garrison. Scanner's picking up|a large body of objects closing rapidly. Scan for alien forms. A wiping clean of the slate|of animosities and prejudice. - This way! This way!|- Run, Boxey! Captain, where you guys been?|We've been looking all over for you! - Ohhh!|- Come on! Move! When these fires reach hyper-combustion,|the whole planet's gonna blow. Let's get outta here! Oh, frack! Warm scan positive.|Multiple three-passenger vehicles. Cylon attack craft.|So they spring their trap. Enemy approaching,|90 microns. - Arm weapons.|- An opportunity... to throw down our arms|and prove, once and for all, that peace begets peace|and love begets love. - And so I--|- Everybody, listen to me! I want everybody to move quickly|towards the exits! That is an order! - Stay where you are! I'm in charge!|- [ People Screaming ] Do what the man says!|He's in charge! Over here, Muffit.|I'm gonna save you. [ Shouting, Screaming ] Enemy closing, 70 microns. [ Shouting Continues ] Enemy approaching,|55 microns. Serina, take Boxey! I'll be back. Let's go!|Move it out! Take it easy! [ Serina ]|Boxey, where are you? [ Shouting Continues ] Muffit! Wait!|We can't leave without Muffit! - We can't leave without Muffit.|- Let's go! [ Woman Sobbing ] [ Shouting Continues ] Do you have any idea where|these Landrams are coming from? - I don't know.|- Landrams courtesy of Commander Adama. Thirty-five microns|and closing. What are you doing|in combat dress? The rest of Blue Squadron|didn't get to go to the party. They had to let you go, though, or they'd been|wise they didn't have all the military there. Well, if you didn't go,|who were those guys? Anybody the commander could find|in fleet to fill the uniforms. You should've seen the one|that got mine. Enemy closing, 30 microns. Recall all warriors|from surface. - Stand by to attack.|- Twenty-five microns... and closing. I want you ladies|in that shuttle craft. - Jolly, what's going on?|- The whole squadron's waiting for orders from the Galactica. - Yahoo!|- Fifteen microns. Cylon attack force|now closing to killer range. They'll take you|in the shuttle. - Let's go.|- Bye. Take care of your mom. I wish he could be my daddy. Enemy closing in,|ten microns. They are not sending out|interceptors. We have taken them|completely by surprise. Closing in, five microns. [ Computer Voice ]|Four, three, two, one. Positive shield now! - [ Apollo ] Starbuck?|- Revved and ready for takeoff. It's coming right at us. - Fire in the bay!|- Damage control. - Your wing ready, Jolly?|- Ready, sir. - Boomer?|- Ready, Captain. Let's go. [ Engines Starting ] There's nothing|to stop them! Incoming surface squadron doesn't seem|to match any known Cylon war machines. Are they gonna be surprised. If we don't stop 'em, we're gonna|have to go back and live on that rock. On target. That one's|for the Atlantia. Here's one for Zac. Father, they're ours!|All of them! But how? Looks to me like a lot of our boys|violated orders and skipped the party. - Make a note to discuss discipline in the ranks.|- Yes, sir. - [ Apollo ] Starbuck?|- Yo. - On your tail.|- Nothin' to worry about. Felgercarb! - Boomer, you give him a hand.|- I'm on my way. [ Starbuck ]|Don't take too long, Boomer. Thanks for the assist. [ Starbuck ]|Squadron Vector Alpha. I'm onto three. Uh, make that two. Let's go!|Press it home! [ Apollo ]|I think we got 'em on the run. - Now let's see if we can find that Cylon base ship.|- Nothing on my scanner. It's hidden someplace|behind Carillon. That's the only way|it could have approached us. We're not gonna let|that base ship go. It can follow us at a safe distance and plot|our every move until the reinforcements arrive. Let's go down on the deck|beneath the scanners. Warriors requesting permission|to locate and pursue Cylon base ship. No. Colonel, we must|conserve our resources... if we're to find a home|for our people. Bring the fleet home. - [ Apollo ] Go onto Cylon frequency.|- [ Starbuck ] What for? They can't see us,|but they'll be able to hear us. Doing what? Praying? You're gonna be Red and Blue Squadrons,|and I'm gonna be Green and Yellow. I'll be Red and Blue-- Oh, I get it!|No, I don't. Sir, two of our warriors|are overdue and unaccounted for. Who? It's Captain Apollo, sir. [ Sighs ]|Who else? - And Starbuck.|- I see. Switching frequencies now. [ Apollo ] This is Green Leader to Red.|All ships ready for attack. Um, yeah. Yeah, we're all ready.|Every one of us. - Speak, Centurian.|- By your command. Colonial Viper squadrons|approaching in large numbers. Surely our Raiders|are close enough to defend us. Our Raiders are still engaged|against the Galactica. Retreat base ship|behind the protection of Carillon. Their scanners will not|be able to find us. [ Apollo ] Yellow Leader,|we have your squadron in visual contact. [ Starbuck ]|Uh, right. Green Leader. I've got two more squadrons|requesting permission to join us. Purple and Orange squadrons. They're just dyin' for a good fight.|Been on reconnaissance. Purple and Orange? Uh, negative, Blue Leader.|Let's not get carried away. We've got all the manpower|we need to knock out one base ship. We're picking up some attack signals|between Purple and Orange squadrons. We don't have|Purple and Orange squadrons. Purple and Orange? Starbuck and Apollo? Lord help 'em both. The warriors continue to advance.|At least six squadrons. Recall all Raiders|to defend base ship. All Raiders|are all destroyed. All destroyed? How?|We took them by surprise. Apparently, it was not as big a surprise|as we had hoped for. Retreat closer to Carillon,|below their scanners. There are reports of fires. - I said lower, or they will destroy us.|- By your command. Just ahead.|There she is. [ Starbuck ]|Lovely. What'll we do? Ram her? We are now picking up|attacking warriors on the scanner. We are too close|to the surface. Sir, telemetry reports surface|of Carillon reaching vapor point. There are only two ships.|It is a deception. Open fire|and retreat from the planet. - Uh, Apollo--|- Okay, Starbuck. Let's get outta here before that tylium|we set on fire blows the planet apart. [ Adama ]|Negative field now. She's going to explode. Let's go home. Some home-- a piece of metal|in the middle of nowhere. Beats just plain nowhere,|at least until we find Earth. Think we'll ever|really find it? We'll find it, someday. Let's go in. [ Adama ]|Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny, the last battlestar,|Galactica, leads a ragtag fugitive fleet|on a lonely quest: a shining planet...|known as Earth.
