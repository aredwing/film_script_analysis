And remember... Dad is a proud omega, as am I. Well, as the future leader of the pack... I wouldn't allow alphas to be doing things like this. - Mm-hmm. - How about things like this? Pick a tree. Any tree. Runt, do you need to take a whiz? - What? - Claudette, inappropriate. This is male-to-male stuff, all right? Runt, do you need to take a whiz? What is wrong with you two? I may be the runt, but give me a break. I was born only, like, a few minutes later than you wolves. But you're still so cute. Cute? Runt, it is unsightly for a wolf to be climbing a tree. Runt! I think he's saying, "Talk to the butt. " Don't forget what Mom and Dad always say. Our uniqueness makes us strong. Hey, what up? That is unique, all right. Okay, parents' first dinner. Let's get this place in order. Oh, Humphrey, can you move the log board to the wall? This is where we fell in love. I know. Against the wall. - Completely against the wall. - I don't know. I think the angle makes it a little less... militant. Oh, and I almost forgot. Can you retrieve the buried bones? Retrieve? As in "dig them up"? Right. Where I buried them. We're serving bones. Our first dinner. Are you criticizing my dinner choice? No, no, no. Not at all. Bones have lots of... roughage. Humphrey, dear, just dig. Sheesh, what am I? The family pet? Hey, Humphrey. Nice digs. Don't get me started. Looks like you already have. How's life with an Alpha? - Efficient. - That is what we thought. "We"? The guys. We thought, "Wouldn't it be cool to take our" omega brother to the wild Berry patch?" Yeah. I'm not really a fan of berries. Fermented berries. I love berries. Oh, hi, Salty. Humphrey, did you find all the... Hey, Kate, got an idea here. How about a few berries to go with the dry... I-I-I mean, uh, the delicious and nutritious marrow. Right, Salty? Come on, what do you say? Humphrey, you're begging. Sorry. Instinct. Um, well, okay. It would make for a nice before-dinner snack. In so many ways. And it is the holidays after all. - Joy to the cave. - Okay, Humphrey. Oh, if you see some holly, bring that back too. 'Tis the season. And if you see the pups, send them home. Okay. Love you, babe. Wow, this rocks! You can see Banff! And... Hey, check it out. I see three wolves down in the valley. Are they of our pack? Mm, not that I recognize. Well, maybe I should go welcome them. What? Remember Grandpa Winston said there were rogue wolves in the area. Let me handle this. Hey! Who are you guys? Well, that was real. Wait a minute. I do believe there is a large inhabitant entering our presence. Like what? A moose? No. It is... A grizzly! I see it right there. No worries. We got this. Let me do my thing. Come on, big guy. Show me what you've got. - Go, Sis! - Okay, right this way, wolf-eater. Claudette, other wolves, and not of our pack. As future leader of this pack, I say charge! And pick on your own size next time. What? I don't believe I had the pleasure of a formal introduction. My name is Stinky, and that's my sister Claudette. And somewhere around here is my little brother, Runt. Runt? Aren't you Winston's grandpups? See? They saw him in me. So... what? You guys just here to hang out? Yeah, yeah. We're-We're just passing through. - What pack are you from? - We're from Banff. Just lost our way. Yeah. Uh, we'd better get over the train tracks before nightfall. Yeah! Oh, that was fun. Berries are awesome. Oh, back to the grind. Uh, I think I'll just drop these off and go now. Hi, Kate! Oh, look at you! All glammed up for Mom and Dad, huh? That was an awfully long trip to the Berry patch. Yeah, but look at all the holly I brought back with me. Deck the cave. Did you see the pups? Uh, no, I didn't. Paw prints. Right by the trunk. I think Runt was jumped. He probably rushed down to help and... Another wolf was here. Yoo-hoo! We're here! Great. Hi, Mom! Look at that view outside. We should gather up the alphas and hunt those rogue wolves down. Let's give 'em the old lockjaw. As usual, they're talking about war. Hello, Kate. Hello, Humphrey. Welcome to our little home. Hey, Dad, put a paw up. The rogue leader wanted to be King and couldn't. Now he has formed an all-Alpha pack. - I'll show 'em all-Alpha. - Uh, berries, anyone? Fab! Is Garth coming? I need him to see life in a cave. He and Lilly have been living in the tall grass. They're just free spirits. You know the younger generation... organic this, natural that. Gosh, these are good. Hey, easy with those, honey. Oh, hi, everyone. Sorry we're late. Lilly and I took a little detour. Hi, Sis. Garth, it's time you found a cave. I told you I'd give up mine. Lilly and I like living in the grass. The very tall grass. Hi there. Where's Runt? Where are they? Oh. You can find him, Kate. Right there. They're going to Banff. We have to go now. Listen, it'll be nightfall soon. Let's prepare a contingent and go at daybreak. We can't wait. We know this valley. This is the rogues. They will have a lot of wolves. This is what they want... lure us to the other side and then attack. I'll go organize everyone. - Nice. - This small wolf is Winston's grandpup? The great Alpha of the Western pack is producing runts. You got a problem with that? See what happens when you let your Alpha daughter marry an omega? And you are? - King. - Original. And let me guess... you're Princess. Yes. Well, King, don't blame me... if you were rejected by my grandpa. Father, let me handle him. This is all you brought me? What about the other two? Hey, it got complicated. We had to fight off bears, and this guy was in a tree. Are you sure this is a shortcut to Banff? Positive. The omegas used to log board here. All we gotta do is get over the stream. I thought you said this was a stream. Okay. Wrong season. How are we gonna get across this? Hmm. No, Kate. No vines. - But we did it last time. - I was young, impulsive. And now I'm old and impulsive. Kate, wiggle around. Wiggle. I'm trying. Whoa! Whoa! I don't know if I can hold you. - Well, you held me last time. - Yeah, well, that was a few years ago. Are you implying that I've gained weight? Are we really doing this right now? Please, Kate, come on. Wiggle. - Good job, omega. - It's all in the tail. You know, what's left of it. We need to move on. Kate, we have to wait this out. Come on. Over here. My, what large teeth you have. - You look cold. - No, I'm just, well... Okay. I'm freezing. And probably hungry. I, uh... I'm a picky eater. Just warning you. But I can be flexible. Mm, yummy! Why aren't you eating the rest? Don't you know how scarce meat is? I was leaving the other half for you. You know, like sharing. I guess it's an omega thing. When we have a kill, those who eat are those who fight for it. And I'm sure the pups do really well under that scenario. The Alpha pups do. Sleep there. It'll be warmer. Kate and Humphrey. They're always doing things their way. Don't they realize how dangerous the rogues can be? I know what the rogues are planning. What is it, my smart omega? They want us to send most of our alphas to find Runt and get trapped by the winter. Then they'll have another pack... hiding in the fields... attack and destroy our home. The omegas, the betas. Well, let 'em try it. We'll have to go with a smaller contingent. Leave some alphas here... just in case. Everyone's ready to go at daybreak. We can only bring half of them. I'll explain later. I'm coming too. No. No, Lilly. This is an Alpha affair. No. This is a family affair. I'll stay here. With them. Let's all get some rest. You see, he is weak. If he were pure Alpha, he wouldn't be cold. - What are you doing? - Making sure our bait stays alive. This is against pack law. This is what we fight against. If you would've brought more bait, she wouldn't have to do this. We leave at daybreak. How do we find which way Mom and Dad went? Go through the field. I'll smell them out. - I can't believe my eyes. Marcel! Paddy! Guys, are we glad to see you. And I you. You see, Paddy? That wasn't so bad. It was a... appropriate. How did you find us? Let's just say someone's bad shot flew up and over the cliff. Never mind the wrong club. Well, this is really serious. The rogue wolves have captured Runt. - What? - This is terrible. I have seen these rogue wolves. Mean things. They never share their kill with the birds. - We think they're in Banff. - Well, count us in. Why, of course. Yes, yes. Wow, what a way to spend the holidays... away from my family. Mom! Dad! Aren't those your other pups? Stinky, Claudette, what are you two doing here? We came to help find Runt. - By yourselves? - Um, yeah. Kind of. How the heck did you find us? I sniffed you out. Great. All we needed. I think it's so charming when the little ones' personalities match their parents'. Yes. They are what you would call "drama wolves". You two are grounded. You hear me? Grounded! How does one ground someone in the outdoors? Well, we lost Runt, so we're gonna find him, like it or not. Together. That is what we'll do. You're not going to talk us out of this. You two, stay right there. Hey, guys, listen. Would you go talk some sense into the pups? How did our parents get across? Oh! Remember how they said they flew across on a vine? We were like, "Yeah, right". Now, pups, do not get any grand ideas. This is for Runt. Stinky! Stinky! Claudette! Uh, now what? Um, uh... Oh, dear, oh, dear. What do we do? - Okay, let's help them. - Help them swing it. Yes! Oh, no. I can't hold on. My tail will never be the same. Push. Push. - Oh, my gosh. What do we... - Jump. Jump! Oh, oh! Are you all okay? They so take after you. Me? Humphrey, that is all you. All right, you two. Oh! I cannot believe those pups snuck out last night. They're sly little guys. Take after their parents. Even the birds smell death. Yeah? I think they're smelling you. Back away. Let me at that smart-aleck omega. Nice. Did I 'cause this? Walk it off. You're just like my Mom. - Why did you do that? - He was going to attack our... If they don't send a rescue brigade by sundown, the runt is of no use to us. Do you understand me? Yes, Father. He's alive. But he is surrounded by a pack... even larger than your own. How fast can we get there? How time flies. Always does. Are you gonna eat me? Eat you? I'm sure you would taste very badly. You smell any bears? Yeah. Kind of. What do you mean, kind of? Your snout is never wrong. This one is different. Only a small whiff of a bear. Hi, guys. A very small whiff. How cute. Uh, for a future predator. No. No-no-no, no, no. Keep going, kids. They're all really cute and cuddly when they're that age. Come on, pups. Your father and I had ourselves... a bad experience after he played with a cub. It wasn't pretty. And neither was her breath. Hey, can I come with you? Talk to the paw. Go home. What is this, a parade? So you're just gonna leave that cub alone, in the forest? - Who are you? - Do you know what will happen... To that cute and adorable little cub? What are you, his agent? You get 10 percent of his cuddliness? Come on. You know the rules of the forest. I know the rules of survival. The... Why am I having this discussion with you? Ow! Sorry. It was a reflex. Karma, my friend. Okay. Time to move on. And fast. But... But I'm lost. Look for gigantic bear tracks. You'll be reunited with your grizzly mama in no time. I haven't seen her in days. I've looked everywhere. Well, look harder. I can't. If the mean wolves see me, I'm a goner. Humphrey, what are you doing? Yeah, Dad. Stinky and I had our fill with a bear yesterday. I do believe the cub poses a danger to us all. What if this were Runt? Okay. Let's get moving. Awesome. I've never spent the holidays with wolves before. Uh, what took so long to get through the forest? Mm, we had to deal with something. Did you know that there's a bear cub following your pups? Yes. We... adopted him. Uh, yeah, just for now. He lost his mother. - Are you wolves crazy? - Yep. Drama wolves. You pups stay here with Paddy. And we mean it. Totally unfair. We couldn't go the extra mile. An injustice. This is so wrong. Wait, wait, wait. Marcel and I agree with your parents. There are so many rogue wolves down in the valley, it would be... extremely dangerous. Okay. Now prepare yourselves. For what? Oh, my gosh. Even with our entire pack here, they'd outnumber us. Kate, look. Wait. What is it? - I smell... - It's just us. Paddy? And us. I knew it. I knew your smell would give us away. What are you doing with a bear cub? We kind of adopted him. Adopted him? Oh, trust me, logic is not our friend here. - He was lost. - Okay. Where are Kate and Humphrey? Under Marcel. That's Marcel? In all his overstuffed down. Okay, Lilly. Stay and watch over them. I will. Hurry back, my macho Alpha. Mm, miss ya. Humphrey, you distract them, and I'll sneak around the back and grab Runt. Distract them. How am I gonna distract an entire pack of big, bad alphas? - Dad? - Kate, Humphrey. We're here to help. Our other alphas are right behind us. Some of those wolves used to run with my pack. Right. They'll recognize us. But they don't know me... as an Alpha. They haven't come for Runt? No. There's no sign of any of them. Hmm. This is not like Winston and Tony. Wait. Over there. Who is that? That is one big wolf. It's huge. It must be a special class of Alpha. We must go greet him. Recruit him. Hey, Garth, they're approaching. Stake your territory. It'll keep them from coming too close. You want me to pee? No, you fool. I want you to howl. Did you hear that weak howl? Do it bigger, like a real Alpha. That is my howl. They're coming closer. They won't stop until you have a big howl. It's a power thing. Ow. Ow. That's odd. A giant Alpha that can't howl. Oh, gosh. They're running now. And it doesn't look like the welcome wagon. Okay, Humphrey. When I say "Now," yawn. - Yawn? - Yes. Yawn big. Now! - That was Humphrey? - Oh, I didn't know he had it in him. We respect your territory. Come into ours. Uh, mm-hmm. Okay, Garth, move forward, slowly. It's like he's floating. I come to the edges of thy territory. What pack are you from? I've never seen an Alpha as big as you. Well, that is because where I come from, we eat bears. Bears? Where did you come from? I... was... chasing... the biggest grizzly in Alaska. And next thing I know, I'm in Canada. Nice people. Uh, oh, and um, the bear... Well, I was, uh... I was just about to dine on it. Yes. You caught it? We never speak of this again. Let's not even talk about it now. Why, who is that beauty of an Alpha? Ah, my daughter. A supreme Alpha, like all of us. May I have a closer look? Please. Come inside our territory. Oh, uh... Oh, well, I see that she already has a pup, so never mind. Never-Never mind. Oh, no. That's not hers. I would prefer, uh, if she... if she meet me halfway. Princess, quickly. Yes, beautiful Princess. Oh, my. If only we had alphas as beautiful as you. What is your name, mighty Alpha? Um, uh, Lockjaw. Lockjaw? That's unusual. Runt. Runt. This way. Yes, yes, well, once I ate a Mountain lion. That too? Excellent. I never thought of eating a lion. Talk about gamy. That's right. Keep 'em laughing, Humphrey. We could use a wolf with that strength and appetite. Come closer, Lockjaw. Join us. I must... guard my kill. And look. The vultures are already here. If they don't kill him, I will. Okay, Runt, come this way. Yes, my alphas. If you join me in eating this grizzly bear... you too will become a super Alpha. - I can't wait. - Okay now. Uh, you, King, you're gonna be first. And then let's... How about the wolf next to you with... Yeah, yes. You. You, with the brown nose. Come forth for your grizzly meat. King, the omega is gone! Over there! What? It's a trick! Alphas, get them! Get them all! Runt! Runt! Take the pups to the north side. The human roads? It'll be okay. You've done it before. Come on, pups. Quickly. Well, what about me? I'll bring you to the middle of the forest. You'll be safer there. Lilly, go with them. I'm staying here. I may not be strong, but I'm smart. Paddy, we have to do something to help. Uh, let... Let me think. Hmm. The best we can do is slow them down. They have three times as many, so we'll fight four times as hard. Wait, wait. Stop! What do you have? I smell a grizzly. A very large grizzly. Great. The more, the merrier. You were saying? Mom! Mom! Stop! They made sure that I was safe. Uh, hi there. I'm Humphrey. This is Kate, and those are our pups. And now they're in trouble. We can only mess them up, Winston. We won't be able to stop this. They can't handle our numbers. They are weak. Purity will win. Princess, lead the rest of the pack to Winston's home and claim it. No, Father. Not this time. Princess. Princess! They are not going to get my grandpups or our home. What the... Mom, they're our friends. I'll be darned. And she is too. But everyone else, they're fair game. I'll take good care of him. I think the playing field just got a bit more even. This is going to be fun. Ready to battle. If it isn't the infamous Garth. The strongest Alpha in the Western pack. I hear he is married to an omega. A weak omega. Bombs away! Well, it was that or a windshield. Stop. Stop! I order you to stop! Oh, look. They're running away. Those cowards. Humphrey. It's getting too cold, right? Mom, Dad, might we make it home in time for Christmas? Let's talk. I'm not even sure where we are anymore. It's so cold. We're lost, aren't we? Runt? What gives? - Is my son climbing a... - Here we go again. Runt, you get down here right now. Hey, look. I see it. I see it! I don't care what you see. - I see the human roads. Really? Really. How far, Runt? Way down the Mountain. I'd say 10 miles or so. If only there was a fast way to get there. Oh, no. No, no, no. No, no-no-no-no-no-no-no! All right, lean left. Now right. This is awesome! Whoa! I still don't think this is appropriate for an Alpha, but... - It sure does rock. - Rock! - It does. - No, rock! Hold on. Is everyone okay? Is everyone okay? Guys? Guys? So where we headed now, Runt? Oh, my gosh. It can't be. Kate, bite my paw. Please bite it. What? Bite it. Okay. - Ow! Kate! - You said, "Bite it". I wanted to see if I was still asleep, in a bad dream. This is where your mother and I survived a mad hunter. Wasn't it, like, some big, bad dude? Y-Yeah. Well, more or less. Is that him? He looks like a wimp. Don't let those Chestnut eyes fool you. He is a killer. Wait. There it is. The blinking lights. Awesome. That is what I saw from the top of the Mountain. Oh, gosh. Everyone behind the Dumpster. What's he doing? I-I don't know. He left the door open? Let's go see the tree. It's really pretty. No. It's a trap. He wants us to go in there. Runt! Runt! Runt! Claudette! Stinky! - Did he... - From gunshots to free food. Go figure. Humphrey, here we are... trying to get home again. I think we already are.
