Well, speaking of which, you want a refill? Sure, thank you. What's up, Dad? Hey. I'm going to Art's for a four-on-four hoop sesh. Mind if I take the car? No, go ahead. Yes! Thanks. Bye, hon. Oh, hey, Grandma's coming! Hey, and... Fill up the tank this time. Please! Hey, where's Max? I thought he was all into this Halloweeny stuff. He is. But tonight's his turn to walk Buster. Oh. Good. You're such a good dog. Come on. Oh, come on, Buster. You do this every time! There's nothing to be afraid of in an old cemetery. All right. Maybe it is a little scary. But look, nothing's gonna hurt us. I'm still wearing the magic ring. This baby is like kryptonite to ghouls. Even Phears, if he even still exists, is afraid of this bad boy. Now, can we get out of here and go home? That brat, Max Doyle! Still hiding Nicky and Tara Roland from me. Well, it won't be for long! Emma Twitchel, star of The Moscow Circus. Come forward! Forward! I command it! Ah! Emma! It's nice to see you, kind of. Your father and I used to play together as children. Ah! Memories. I have called you, the great Emma Twitchel, the biggest star of The Moscow Circus... Yes. ...back from your sleep... Yes. ...to perform a sacred duty. Ooh! All right. You can never find good help. Now, pay attention. I am Phears, the most powerful, dark spirit in existence. I command all the spirits laid to rest in this cemetery. Even you. You understand? Yes! Yes, I very much understand! Of course you do. Now, listen carefully. Several years ago, a research parapsychologist by the name of Michael Roland came across an urn of ashes which contained the remnants of, well, me. It was left there for him in his laboratory. Thinking that it might be just another artifact for his collection, he decided he would examine it more closely later and placed it on a shelf. He, of course, had no idea at all of the power he held in his two little hands. And through his own carelessness, he released me back into this world. It gave me an opportunity to achieve my ultimate goal, create an army of the dead. An army that would do my bidding... And possess the bodies of the living so that I would ultimately become the most powerful force on Earth. Even among the living. This plan is no good. What? Souls, when they die, they want to go to afterlife. They want to see their parents, their relatives. They don't want to linger with you! What fun is that? Fun? We're not talking about fun! We're talking about the power to create a new breed of ghost among the living. It's a completely different... No! This plan is... How you say... Bonkers! Well, it's not up to you to prove I'm bonkers, so... I mean, you have no choice but to obey me! And that's what I thought about Michael and Michelle Roland. But they discovered my plans. So, Roland created a ring and a magic spell that could fight off my ghosts and keep me trapped here in this cemetery. Ugh. So, I decided to make them more like us, ghosts. That way, they could never interfere with my plans again. The two little Rolands got away and as long as they were free, I couldn't get the parents to tell me where they hid the ring! When Max Doyle's family moved into the Roland house my cat Mauler was stuck there, lost without me, his master. And to top it off, that snotty little Max recovered the ring and now uses it to protect those kids! That brat, Max, foiled my plans before, but this time I know his secret. It's that ring he wears on his right hand. I've got to get that ring off his finger so I can snatch those kids! Otherwise, my plan is useless. What this have to do with Emma? Oh, don't you get it? Max Doyle is keeping your spirit from moving on to see your loved ones. How dare he? That evil boy! Exactly. So, I'm going to give Max a little present. Something that will make him all warm and cuddly. Ah! A sweater! No, not a sweater. You! You're going to climb inside Max as a berserker ghoul. Oh, the very sound of it makes me all tingly. You're going to inhabit his body. Get him into trouble with his school and with his parents. And then get that ring off his finger! Once he is powerless, I can snatch the two Roland brats and we'll both be free! It's a good plan. This goes in the first room. Aw! Look how cute he is. Why, Cammy, I didn't know you felt that way. Oh! Oh, uh... I was talking about the dog. I knew that! Hey, Cam my. I was thinking maybe we could work on our science midterm together? Oh... Yeah, I don't know, Max. It's just that I'm so busy with, you know, the haunted house and stuff. But it's on Halloween, so you should come by. Um, it will be really scary. I'm not scared of anything. My best friends are ghosts. I mean, my best friends are totally into ghosts. Movies and video games and stuff. If it's got ghosts, they love it. Me too. Yeah. So, like I said, you should come by. Urn... I'll show you around. It's a date. Just an expression! Figure of speech! Nailed it. Max, where have you been? I was just talking to a girl. Who? Cammy Cahill. Whoa! Nice! Guys, we don't have time for this. It's been almost a year since we lost Mom and Dad. I think I have a shot with her if she could just see the real me. I just want her to think I'm normal so I can be her date for Halloween. Max, you don't have time to make people think you're normal. You need to be helping us find our parents. Yeah. I have a life, you know. Okay, that was rude. I'm sorry. We'll see you upstairs. That never gets old. Come on. Mom! Dad! I'm home! Grandma! So good to see you. Look how big you've gotten... When you walked in I thought you were an adult in a Max Halloween costume. Hi, cousin Shelly. Hey. Oh... We can only stay just a little bit, but I have enough time to go like this... Grandma! I'm too old for that. "Never too old to be pinched" is a Grandma law! So, how's school? It's weird. What do you mean, "weird"? You seeing anybody? Seeing? You mean, like ghosts? Like a girl. Like a girl! Just getting in the Halloween spirit. Oh, and, um, speaking of school, Chester called and apparently the PE test is on again for tomorrow. Oh, great! And I thought Friday would be an easy day at school. Oh, come on, Max. It's no big deal! Hey, PE is fun. It helps with your coordination, your concentration... Besides, it builds your body up for the babes. Yeah, but it's the stupid rope-climb test. I can't even get started on that thing. I always fail. Oh, and gym is graded! It will totally dunk my whole GPA. Well, it will if you go in with that attitude. Hey, come on, Son. You got to think like a winner. You got to feel like a winner. You know what? Get in there, stand at the bottom of that rope, stare up and say... When I get to the top I just hope nobody looks up my shorts. I was very good-looking when I was younger. Things change, darling. You'll learn. Look, your brother, Colin, is really good at that. So, go ask him for some pointers. Colin? The only pointers he has are the ones popping up on his forehead. Max! He's definitely from my side of the family. Okay, why don't you go ask your brother for some pointers. Okay, I will. Bye, Grandma. Goodbye, sweetie. - Bye, cuz. - Yeah. Happy Halloween. Try to meet a nice ghoul. You could bring her home to your mother. You know, you would be so much better as a blonde. Have you ever thought about that? What's up, booger boy? Wait. Do you hear that? Hear what? That... That cat meowing. It sounds like it's coming from right here in the house. Ha! You wish. Mom and Dad would never let you get one. So, you don't hear anything? No. Just this... Hey! Get off! Ugh! I have to wear this. Listen, here's the situation. Tomorrow is senior photo day and I figure since all the girls in my class will be in one place, this is the perfect opportunity for me to score some points, you know. Put on a little show. Oh. So, you want to do a magic act? No, not a whole act, you doofus. Just a trick, something big. Something that will impress Jessica Rogers and her whole posse. And you're gonna show it to me. Right now. Right now? Right now. Uh... You want me to show you a trick? Yeah, I don't know. I'm kind of rusty right now. Maybe I better think about it. Well, you better think fast. 'Cause I'm not leaving until I see a good one. Ow! Ow! Well, you said you wanted to see something good. Is this good enough? Yeah, this is... This is great. How do you do this? Well, you just stand in front of your shoes and chant... Got it. Works every time. Cool. Thanks, man. Oh, hey, hey. Um, I have that rope climb test tomorrow. Any pointers? Yeah, urn... Don't fall. Okay, come here. Good news. I found a solid clue about your parents. I went on the town's historical website and found this... You know, I hate that they put "ghost hunter" in quotes. He was a ghost hunter, obviously, or none of this would be happening. Okay, so... Three years ago, it says your dad was doing research at the old county courthouse. Doesn't mention your mom. Well, that was just two days before both Mom and Dad disappeared for good. And then we... Ended up like this. You know, like, that courthouse is the last place Dad was before he disappeared. We need to search there. Tonight. Tonight. Why tonight? Well, Halloween is coming and Phears will have the power to free his ghost army on that night, if we don't stop him. We need to go there. Now. I liked Halloween a lot better when I thought the ghosts were make-believe. Let's go. Maybe we should forget it. What? You're not scared, are you? Why wouldn't I be? 'Cause you're not a little tiny baby. What did you say? I'm gonna open the little tiny window. Mmm-hmm. Okay? Yeah. Oh! Max! I'm good. He's good! He's good. Whoa! This place is pretty cool. Cammy did this with her friends. She's so talented. Of course she is. Not now! Okay, I'm a ghost and this is some scary stuff. If I didn't have my ring to protect me, I don't think I would be able to do this. Seems Cammy has a thing for freaks and weirdoes, Max. Maybe you do stand a chance! Very funny. Guys, let's start over there. Of course. Start in the scariest place. Makes perfect sense. Guys? Note to self, not a ghost. How did people get anything done before computers? If I could just use a search function, this would take two seconds. We're wasting time, we should be looking somewhere else. Tara, it's okay. We're doing the best we can. Don't beat yourself up. We'll find something. What if we don't? Uh, Max? A little help, please. Go. MAXI Nick? Oh, yes, that's it! It probably has everything we need to know about Dad. Get it down! I got it. Let's get out of here and check this stuff out at my house. Yes! Hey, Max. Cammy? What are you doing here? I was just... I wanted to check out your haunted house. But you couldn't wait till it was open? It's scarier this way. I love a good scare. So, what's in the box? Oh, just some stuff for a project I'm working on. What are you doing here? Oh, I just came back because I left my phone. You know, it's pretty weird that you're here. Most people would be really scared here alone at night. Not me. Nothing scares me. Except for wood rot. Which those cross-beams are full of. With their dampness and moisture. You're, uh... You're a pretty interesting guy there, Max. Can I take that as a compliment? If you want. I'll see you tomorrow. Let's see. Okay, this was everything he was working on. There's so much I don't even know where to start. You'll have to start without me. I'm exhausted. I have to get some sleep. I have that stupid rope-climbing test tomorrow in PE. If I flunk this, I'll have after-school PE for a month! Wait, I have an idea. What if Nicky and I show up in gym class tomorrow and help you up the rope? What? All you have to do is make it look like you're climbing and we'll fly you up. I mean, it's the least we could do for you. You know, that would work. Mmm-hmm. And not only will I pass, but Cammy Cahill will be totally stoked. Oh, no, maybe this was a bad idea. Anything for a friend, Max. Whoo! Whoo! Hey, Cammy. Great seeing you last night. Oh, um... Yeah, that... That was pretty random, huh'? Uh... Just wondering if... Maybe you wanna come over tonight and maybe do some extra credit for science class? Um... Urn... You love him. I... The thing is tonight, Max, I'm just so busy, um... Plus my science grades are pretty good. MAXI Oh. Okay. Can't wait for our haunted house date. Hmm? Hey, Max! Look what we got! The Nocturnal and Dawn of Angels. Is that awesome? Yeah, it is! And you're the first guy we want to play with. Yeah, you are! Uh, guys? It's full HD. 1080p. Guys? Multi-player with connectivity! Up to 32 outside challenge games! With our dedicated T3 line, we'll be flying tonight. Yeah, baby! Guys! No... Yeah, yeah, yeah... You guys have fun tonight. No. No. No, wait! Please, wait. Or maybe we can do it tomorrow? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We know, you want to be the first guy to open the box and unlock the cheats. Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead! Come on, man! Thirty-two outside challenge games? Why didn't you tell me before? Okay, meet me at my house tonight. We are gonna beat this game! Bam! All right see you boys after school. Okay? We'll see you later, dude. It's gonna be awesome! Fall in! All right, listen up! If any of you deadbeats expects to pass my class, you're gonna have to get past Lester. Uh, Lester? Yeah, Lester. The rope. I'm on a first-name basis with all of my apparati. Side horse is Jimmy. Medicine ball is Eric. And the high bar is Tiffany. Good times. Why? Why do you name all your gym equipment? I have my reasons. All right, the men are up first. Atherton! Stevens! Doyle! Brinkman, Freeman, Hardy, Willis! Move it. Move it. Move it! Move it. Move it! Are you waiting for a printed invitation, Atherton? Move it! Could've been better. Pass! Stevens, come on. Let's go. Ring my bell, Stevens. Ring my bell. You make it look easy, my friend. Pass. Doyle. All right, Doyle. Show me what you got. Glad you're here. I'm so glad I'm here too! To watch you fail! So, how do you want to do this? Hand over hand! What do you mean, "How you want to do it?" Nicky, you grab him under his arms. Oh, uh... No way, I'm ticklish! What's being ticklish got to do with climbing a rope'? Maybe I should grab him by his gym shorts. What are you trying to do? Give me a wedgie? First of all, that's disgusting. Second, I don't want to give you a wedgie. I grab his arms and you push his butt. No girl is pushing my butt. Have you lost what is left of your tiny mind? Get up the rope! Doyle! I have other students waiting! Doyle, get down here! Okay, Max, let's go down now. Oh, no, wait, just a little bit longer. Cammy's digging it. Okay, Max, this is just getting ridiculous. You're trying to impress her with a lie. "Work with what you've got," I always say. You know what? I'm not gonna be a part of this. Tara! Tara! Tara! Oh! Get off me. Get off me! - Get off me. - Max. It's just my neck. You okay? That was so cool, but are you okay, Max? Is Max okay? Oh... He just dropped from the ceiling and used me like an airbag and you want to know if Max is okay? I just had to get up the rope to pass, right? Yeah. So? Then I'm way more than okay. Once this class picture goes into the yearbook, it's gonna haunt you forever, all right? So, let's see some big smiles on those faces. Hey, dweeb. I can't deal with this anymore! This is ridiculous. I've had it! I've had it with you people! This is too good. Hey, Doyle, your brother's almost as big a loser as you are. Up top! Oh, yeah'? Yeah. Excuse me... Mr. Doyle, please sit down. Well, check this out. Not you, Mr. Doyle. You... Mr. Doyles! Oh, man. "Oh, what a dweeb I am." "Oh, what a dweeb I am." Wow! You're a dweeb, all right. A much bigger one than your brother. Boom! Max! Mr. Doyle! Max! Mr. Doyle! Mr. Doyle! Okay, um... I think we're done here. We are not done yet! So, Max, how'd you do on the dreaded rope test? Uh... Well, guess you could say it ended with a big bang. But I passed. There you go; Atta boy! Proud of you! Aren't you proud of your brother, Colin? I don't know if I'd say "proud." And Colin, how was the photo shoot? Did everyone enjoy it? Yeah. A little too much. Well, guess it was a memorable day for both you boys, huh? Well, the day is not over yet is it, Dad? Is that a cat? Wait. You can hear that? Well, of course we can hear it. It sounds like it's coming from one of your rooms. Oh, come on, you guys didn't bring a cat in the house, did you? I don't know anything about a cat. Uh, me neither. Boys! You know how allergic I am. Whoa, whoa, Mom, don't look at me, okay? I hate cats, you know that. It's probably, monkey-face Max, who loves cats. You know, just a couple of days ago, Max said that he thought he heard a cat in his bedroom. Well, I better not find a cat when I go up there, Max! Or you're gonna be grounded and that includes Halloween. Mom, trust me, there is no cat in the house. Max, how could you? Mom, please, lemme help you. Max! Little warning, please? Sorry, man, we're just so excited. Look at this. We found a book of spells. Yeah. Can any of them make an older brother disappear? As an older brother I certainly hope not. Uh, speaking of which, where is your family? They all went upstairs. They think there's a cat in the house. There is a cat in the house. Yeah. It's Mauler. - Mauler? - Yeah. Yes, Phears' cat. I mean, he got stuck here when you condemned Phears back to the cemetery. Man, he'll do anything for that cat. It's his pride and joy. Yeah. Great. A ghost cat. Next I'll be haunted by the spirit of the goldfish I flushed when I was four. Max. Now! Coming. Anyway, if everyone can hear him, I don't think that's Mauler. Let's go. I'm warning you, Max. You'd better be telling us the truth. Dad, I told you. I don't have a real cat up here. Whoa! Put that... Geez. Guys, it's just Charlie from next door. Keep it away from me, because I'm gonna have hives for a week. See, Dad, told you nerdy boy had a cat up here. I had nothing to do with it. Oh, right. Max, then how did he get into the dresser then? It was Colin. He walked in, went straight to the dresser... Oh, stop it! Because he knew the cat was in there. Max, stop, stop it! How obvious could he get? Hey! You wanna disobey us? Fine, you're grounded. Congratulations. That means you come straight home from school right into this room. And that includes Halloween. Let's go, honey. And no computer. And that's what you get for trying to make me look stupid in front of my class. Trying? I've already told you where the Doyles' house is. Max's room is upstairs. First door on the right. Emma, Emma. I can't leave the graveyard in this form. So it's very important that you get this all correct. All right'? Now when you find the brat, you'll take him over and control his every move. Make his life a living nightmare until he has no choice but to give up that ring. Then he'll be powerless to protect Tara and Nicky. And I can capture them and use them to force their father to give me what I need to complete my plan to rule the realm of the living and the dead. Okay, that's right. I do this. But only for a little while. I get sleepy. Emma, you can nap yourself silly, when this is over. But now our little plan is about to begin. So wake up. Go ahead. Oh, and... Emma! Emma! Don't forget my cat, please. Morn, Dad, about that cat. Hey, I'm surprised your mother got any sleep at all last night, after that stunt you pulled. And by the way, she got to her allergy medication just in time. I'm sorry you had to go through any of that, Mom. But I didn't bring that cat in here. Oh, just save it, Max. You're so grounded, young man. But Mom, Halloween's the best night of the year. You heard me. Oh, and did you clean up the mess that cat made in Colin's room? Not only did I clean it, Colin took my room and made me sleep in his because of the smell. This behavior is not like you. And for your information, your brother is a great... Hey. Great role model for you. He's disciplined. He always applies himself. And what is with the pajamas? Have you been eating a lot of cheese or something? Here, have some breakfast. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? We don't play games at the table. Come on, here. - Colin! - Colin! Whoa! Oh! Oh! Oh! No, not on my couch. Get off my couch. Colin! This isn't funny, Colin. What are you doing? Whoa, whoa, whoa! No! WOW! Whoa, but that was really good though. Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Oh! Oh, oh, oh! - Do what? - I don't know! Get something. Get... Call 9-1-1? And say what? From the light of Earth, the dark descends. Should they return? That all depends. Son? Colin, honey. What's wrong with you? It's like Cirque du Soleil in here. What are you talking about? What are we talking about? Take a look at the house. Is that syrup? Can I have some pancakes? Ah! There you are. Did you get my cat? It's exhausting being berserk. I dead tired. Pardon pun... Pardon pun... It's a fine pun. So did it work? Did you get the ring off that brat's finger? I go inside brat. I get him to go crazy. Good. Then I make him tear up kitchen. Cause his parents much much worry. Good, good. Then other boy use ring, say chant and scare me away. What? What other boy? There's only one boy who has the ring and knows that chant and that's Max Doyle. Well, this boy is stupid-looking with red hair. It's not Max. It's his worthless, goof brother Colin. You weren't even in the right victim. Hey. hey. hey, hey! What do you want from me? I... No. I don't know... I go into first bedroom on the right for you. You tell me to haunt that goof. Get your goof room straight. Well, you'll have to try again. Today at that brat's school. I need to get that ring off his finger. Halloween is coming. My army of ghosts awaits my command to arise and take over the bodies of the living. There's no time to lose. No, it's time to snooze. I always thought dying would make things easier. But that's not how it works. So why, then, almost four centuries after it was hypothesized, is Newton's law of gravity disproven? Miss Cahill. Because Newton's theory only applied to the gravitational force field up to 97,000 feet. Past that point, when gravity is incrementally disbursed, the old law doesn't stand up. Correct. And who can tell me why that's important to NASA? Mr. Doyle. Because as gravity decreases, inertia increases, affecting weight disbursement, fuel efficiency and speed and thrust guidelines. Excellent. Both of you should put in for extra credit. Now moving on to water oxidation as energy... Hey, maybe since the midterm assignment is a team we could partner up? I'd be extremely okay with that. ...is present, there will be an electrical spark that happens. Hydrogen will appear at the... Ah! And oxygen will... This is the right goof. Okay, I go now. Then the electrode will begin to spark and cause a chemical reaction... Mr. Doyle! What are you doing? Mr. Doyle, that will be quite enough. Mr. Doyle! Now I use water oxidation as energy. Excuse you. Mr. Doyle, what do you think you're doing? That is a great abuse of school property. Mr. Doyle, please, just stop... Yea-haw.! Get down from there. Mr. Willis, Mr. Freeman, please, restrain Mr. Doyle immediately. Excuse you! Did you not take your medication today? Oh, and now you're asleep, that's great. Max, are you okay? I don't know what that little stunt was supposed to prove, but you can get straight to the Principal's office where I'm going to recommend detention for a month. But I don't even know what I did. Ms. Cahill, get me a towel. Oh, man, this is bad. Really bad. Max, we went looking for you in class. Look, you guys, I'm in big trouble. Phears sent this spirit or ghost or whatever it is to possess me. And it makes me act all crazy and gets me in trouble. I have no control over it. You mean it's like in you right now'? I guess. Lemme check it out. Yeah. Whoa! Uh, yep, there is someone inside you. It's a woman. And she's sleeping. Great. Maybe she's sleeping now, but when she wakes up, I go berserk and there's nothing I can do about it. This is gonna get me expelled. Worse, it's gonna make me look crazy in front of Cammy. Maybe Phears put her into you to get to us. How does that work? How do I know? But if this keeps up... Sit down. So, Mr. Doyle, you're aware that your actions today not only disrupted class, but also caused considerable monetary damage to this school. Yes, ma'am. And you do understand that you'll have to pay the school back with your own time and money. Tell her it wasn't your fault. I'm not doing that. What do you mean you're not doing it? You'll do what you're told. Man, she's got bad breath. Now, Mr. Doyle. If it weren't for that fact that you have a high GPA, and your mother is head of the PTA and a good friend of mine, I'd put you on permanent suspension. As it is, I'll have to think of a proper punishment. Hmm. What was that? I didn't do anything. I'm just sitting here. So you think school is just one big play yard, huh'? You wanna play? Oh, you're gonna play. Max, how long are you gonna be doing this? We need to get back to my father's journal. Can't you tell that coach lady you have more important things to be doing? Oh. Sure, Tara. I'll just tell her that I don't have time for her punishment. I'm sure she won't give me more laps or push-ups or mountain climbers or anything. Okay, great. I guess sarcasm doesn't exist in the afterlife. You guys have done nothing but get me in trouble. Could you just go away? Please, leave me alone. Hey, Max, how are you? Pretty crazy in science class, huh? Yeah. Don't know what got into me. No, it was interesting. Interesting'? That's a good thing, right'? So you play soccer now? Yeah, just gettin' some laps in. Keeping things interesting. Doyle! Doyle, nobody told you you could slack off. When you're on this field, your butt is mine. Let's go. Can't I just... Can't I just... Take a two minute break? The next time you decide to goof off in class or attack the Principal or squash me like a bug, it's gonna get even worse. Carlyle! Stand in front of him and block the pass. Wake up! All right, now get in there and play some soccer. Soccer? I am loving soccer. You're a little freak, is what you are. Coach Freeley, is that Max out there? Yeah. Did you know about this? No. Whoa! Max! Okay, I'll sleep now. - What happened? - Here. Hey, let's get him. Help him up. Get some help over here. Pick him up. Grab him tight. Get him, all right. Yeah, stand up. Come here. Are you all right? Max. Max. Why didn't you tell me you were a soccer star? Huh? It's you, Max. You can lead us to victory in tomorrow's championship game. You can finally bring me... Us... Can bring us that city-wide championship trophy. Max, you're my secret weapon. Well, okay, I guess. Okay, you guess. Oh, my plum. I just wanna pinch your cheeks but you're so sweaty. The rest of you, calisthenics! Hey, Max, you dropped this. My ring. Oh, thank God you found it or there would have been serious trouble. So, wow... I mean, that was really something. I'm kind of surprised. Not as much as I am. Remember when you asked me out on Halloween? Well, I was thinking maybe tonight you could meet me at the courthouse at 8:00. For the big grand opening. I could show you around and give you a private tour. Cool? Cooler than cool. Okay. Halloween. All Hallows' Eve. Tonight, my powers finally return to me, and I'll be stronger than ever. Soon, in just a matter of a few short hours, I will be free to unleash my undead army from their terrible prison. And nothing will stop me from ruling everything on Earth. Dead or alive. Amateurs. - Thank you. - Happy Halloween. Happy Halloween. Max, there you are. Finally, I really need you on door duty. Where've you been? I was just playing soccer after school. Soccer? Son, considering how much trouble you're in, don't lie to me about suddenly liking sports, okay? Don't get my hopes up. But I was. Oh, here they come. Would you get upstairs, get in costume okay? Come down and work the door? Please. I love you, Dad. Thank you! Trick or treat? Trick or treat? Max, we got some exciting news for you. Wow. This is turning out to be the best day ever. What've you got? We took a look at that video you shot of Colin's freak-out this morning. Let me show you. Watch. Look at this guy. All right, stop it. All right, play that back. Okay, listen. Emma... Twitchel? Yes. We think that's her name and we think we can talk her out of you. Seriously? Yeah. Oh, that would be awesome. I was totally worried that she would ruin my date with Cammy tonight. Date with Cam my. Tara, relax. Look, we talked about this. Emma will most likely respond to a female voice. You have to do this. Max, lay down. Okay. Okay, Ready? Yeah. Emma, Emma. Wake up, Emma. Emma, wake up. Come on, Emma. Okay, it's okay. Stay with us, Max. Emma, listen to me. We almost got it. You can do it, Emma, come on. Come on, Emma, wake up. Where am I? Why am I not in goof boy? Excuse me? Because we set you free. And that made you young again. And we're setting Max free too. Max is done with ghosts. We're all gonna leave him alone now. Yeah, Max. We know you're sick of us, so... We're gonna go away, forever. What? Nicky, Tara... Nicky? Tara? I know these names. I hear goof boy talk about you. He says he will always help you, because you are his friends. No matter what. You said that? Of course. It might get frustrating at times, but I'll never give up on you guys. You're my friends. Oh, Max, thank you. Aw, Max. Okay. Okay, Nicky. That's what I'm talking about. You are good, goof boy. Not evil. Evil? Why would you say that? Yeah. Phears. Phears tells me that goof... I mean... That Max was keeping me from moving on to see my loved ones. Max, I'm so sorry, I... I should not have trusted Phears. He is a most wicked ghoul. Yeah. I won't argue with you on that one. Max! For the love of Pete, would you suit up and get downstairs and work the door? Those kids, they're like a marauding horde of candy-crazed goons. They're relentless. He has berserker in him too? He was born that way. So your family was Russian circus acrobats? Oh, yes. They were the most renowned performers in all of the land. We were on a tour of America for our first time, and our bus crashed outside the town, many years ago. We were all buried here. Trick or treat? Whoa! Cool trick. How did you do that? Oh, a good magician never tells. Thank you. Happy Halloween. Now, because of Phears' dark magic, I cannot be with my family. Just like us. No. No, you are not like me. But we can't see our family because of Phears either. No, when I say that you are not like me, it's because you are not dead. But we're ghosts. Yeah. Yeah. Not real ones. Phears made you like this. And your parents too. You're ghosts, but not dead. Prisoners. Your parents are still alive. Nicky. Wait, if our parents are prisoners, do you know where they are? No, only Phears knows this. I do not know. I can only feel that they are alive, like I feel you, but I do not know where they are. Then do you know why Phears wants Nicky and Tara so badly? Because they are Rolands, Roland blood. He must capture all the Rolands and find the antidote your father created before he can move forward with his plan and unleash his undead army into living bodies. Maybe you can find them. Warn them. Tell them we're okay, where we are... How we love them. Please. I would love to, but I do not know how. I think I found a spell that could help. Right there. What will it do? Well, it says, we have to go to the cemetery and return you to your grave and say this spell. Well, we must go tonight. Go where? To the cemetery. To the cemetery. Oh, no, no, this is a really bad idea. It's Halloween and this is the night where Phears will be at his strongest. Max, all magic is at its strongest tonight, even yours. Yes. And if we go tonight maybe I can be with my family again. Please Max, come on. We have to help her. And if we have another ghost by our side, we can probably find Mom and Dad quicker. Come on, man. You have to do it. Remember what you said about friends. No matter what... Trick or treat? Urn... Just help yourself to the candy. I'm still grounded, but let me see what I can do. Ugh. Colin's back up to his cat tricks again. Great. Hey, hey, hey, what're you doing in here? No one is manning the candy bowl. We're gonna get tricked. Mom, you look great. Flattery will get you nowhere. But thanks. Mauler. What did you call me? Mauler. Mauler? I like it. But flattery will get you nowhere. I'm telling you, that cat... Oh, no. What's up? Wow! Mom, you look amazing. What's up, Dad? Max, shouldn't you be getting to that special soccer practice that Coach Freeley wants you at? What? What're you talking about? He's not part of a team. Well, he is now. Max kicked butt at practice today. He's their star player. Freeley was freaking out. And get this. Tomorrow, he's starting at the game against Dylan High. So, he's got to get going. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute! My son is a starter in the city finals? It gets even better. Coach Freeley called him their secret weapon. When were you planning on telling us this? Well, I was gonna surprise you. Well, we're surprised. Wow, my son's a starter. I told you you could do it. Didn't I say he could do it, honey? Of course, dear. But we should get going, I mean, we don't wanna be late and be kicked off the team, right? Oh, no. Right, right, right. No. No son of mine is ever gonna be late for practice. Go, fight. Go. No, wait. What time is the game? Two o'clock. Two o'clock? Yep. Two o'clock. Two o'clock. Two o'clock. Two o'clock. I'm gonna call Eddie, I'm gonna cancel that golf game, and I am gonna be there. Yeah, you are. I better call Joan. Yeah. Go call Eddie. Look, Mom and Dad told me about how I freaked out this morning. But you helped me, calmed me down and kept me from hurting myself. I don't even know what happened, but you helped me, so, thank you. I owe you one. Do you know what happened to me? You were possessed by a berserker ghoul. Right, I said I owe you one. That doesn't mean I have to believe your stories about ghosts and magic. You know I don't believe that stuff. Well, maybe someday you will. Dude, just get out of here. Go do your nerd stuff. Dad, I need the phone. Come on, my grave, further ahead. Okay, now what do we do? Okay, Emma must return to her grave and Max will say his chant while holding the ring. That should break the spell and you can be dead again. Okay, great, then all I have to do is... My ring! I don't have it. I took it off and stuck it in my pocket after soccer practice. You mean you came out here, on Halloween, with no protection from Phears? Don't worry. I'll run back and get it right now. Did I just hear someone say that they forgot to bring the ring to our little party? How careless. Looks like you all fell for my little plan. Even you, Emma. You look lovely, by the way. You see, I knew you would be good to get the ring off his finger but how would I capture all of them together? Easy, you tell them the story about your family. How you want so badly to be reunited, just like Tara and Nicky want to be with their parents, and presto! You all end up back at your graveside. You see, I didn't just pick you by accident. I knew nothing of this plan, little ones. I swear it. Don't worry, Emma. We believe you. Phears just used you. Oh. Oh, yes. Did I use you? I'm so sorry. Finally, the end of the Roland brats and Max Doyle. This is gonna be fun. No, leave Max out of it. He didn't do anything to you and he has nothing to do with our parents. On the contrary, he's had plenty to do with disrupting my plans. And now all of you are going to pay for it. Max! Tara, run. Come on. Not so fast, tough guy. And as for you, missy... Max, run. Get the ring. Yes, Max. I will help you. Oh, you're not going anywhere. Ah, yes, but of course. When in need, ask your friends for help. Catch that boy and destroy him. Wow! Cool costume. I'm totally getting one of those next year. Ghouls! Look out. Move. Ghoul chase! Hey, bro. What's up'? Max? My bro. My bro right there. Is that Max? Max, this is awesome. How are you doing all this? Well, my minor in college is gonna be in makeup and special effects. Good. That's good. You fight like a ghoul. Max! How cool was that? Max. Max. There are too many people here. These ghouls will destroy them all. I'm sleepy- No, no, don't fall asleep now. I need you. Yeah, you nerds go all out for Halloween. What's up? Those aren't nerds and they're not going anywhere, except after me. Dude, not cool. Dude! Not dudes. Ghouls. Oh, you wanna play, huh? Max, follow me. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Do you believe me about ghouls now? Yeah, I'm getting there. Stop it. It's nothing. What's up? Ah! Come to papa. Mauler, of course. Bed. Oh. Here, kitty, kitty. What? Cat got your tongue? Emma. Emma, Emma, you awake? Got any ideas what to do with this cat? Just catch him, Max. I'm too sleepy. Swell. Okay, Mauler. Come on, boy. Take it easy. Okay, Max. I will help you. Okay, Mauler. Maybe this will get you. Check this out. Oh, man! I hope we're not too late. Me too. 'Cause I must go sleep now. No, I still need your help. Use the ring, Max. And mangy cat. That is all you need. Good night. Tara! Nicky! Where are you guys? Max! Over here. Phears locked us in this creepy, old crypt with his dark magic. Yeah, well, we'll see about that. From the light of Earth, the dark descends. Should they return? That all depends. When hands point up to moonlit skies, on ten, three, one the darkness dies. Not the funnel! Oh! That bratty kid and his ring again! Enough! Tough luck, you little dweeb. If I get dragged into that funnel, she goes with me and you'll never see her again. Now cough up that ring. Yeah, well, let's see who else gets dragged into this. One second. Not Mauler, my most beautiful wicked cat! Bye, Mauler. Too bad no one will ever see you again. Don't hurt him. Then let Tara go. You promise not to destroy him if I release her? Don't listen to him, Max. Don't trust Phears. It's a trick. I got a few of those up my sleeve myself. Okay, I promise. Now let her go. What do we do now? Now we let the cat out of the bag. He's got Mauler. My beautiful, evil kitty. You tricked me, you two-faced brat! No! Mauler, don't be afraid. Mauler, Daddy's coming. Be brave. Be brave for Daddy! My God! He would do anything for that cat. Okay, come on Tara, we promised to help Emma and help her get her back to her resting place. Okay, you ready? Emma? Come on, Emma, wake up. You can do it, Emma, can you hear me? Oh! Whoo! Emma? Oh, thank you. Thank you all so much. You're very, very kind. Now, I must go home. Oh, Emma, if you see our parents, can you tell them that... Well, I'm happy for her. If she didn't have friends in Plover before, she does now. Yeah. Phears is gone for a while. Yeah, now if I can just convince Cammy I'm not a total weirdo. Well, you never know. Stranger things have happened. Yeah. Let's go, Orange! Let's go, Orange! Don't let him have it. Take the ball! No! No! No! What are you, asleep? No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Come on, come on. All right, Freeley. Three minutes left. Tie game. You got any more substitutes, put them in. Thomas, you're out! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Okay, Secret Weapon. You're up. Listen, it's all for you. Okay? Take forward. Go. Max! Come on, hustle up. Max. Come on. Let's do it. What's going on? Ready? Come on. Where's right forward? It's over here. Good hustle. You can do it! Here! You'll be fine. Good. All right. You got this, Max. Go. - Yes. - Back away, loser. Max. What are you doing? Dude, that way. Max. I think this will work better. All right. - Oh! - Yeah! Do you think that hurt his head? Hurt his head? Mom? Honey, come on. When you're making all-star plays like that, you just lay it out there. You don't worry about getting hurt. Yeah! That's my boy! Go Max! Go Max! Oh, ref, come on! Nicky! Are you okay? I'll be all right. What about Max? Are you sure? Stay down, stay down. He's fine. He's over there. What are you guys doing? Max, you've got this! Just believe in yourself. Come on, Max, you can do it! We got the cup! We got the cup! Never had a doubt. Never had a doubt. Good job. I'm so proud of you! Boom, huh! So proud of you. Nice game there, Beckham. Thanks. That was, I mean, crazy. Thanks. Look, about last night... I really wish you would have stayed. I just wanted to thank you for everything you did for the haunted house. That was really cool. But I guess, you were just getting good and rested up for the game. Yes. That's exactly what it was. Well, the haunted house is still there. I may not be as good with effects and stuff as you are, but I can still give you a really cool exclusive tour. Now? As good a time as any. Okay. HEY- Way to go, Bro. What's up? We should follow him. No. Let him go. Okay. So, we totally blew away our whole fund-raising goal and I am pretty sure it's because of the awesome show you and your friends put on. So, thank you. Oh. Yeah, my pleasure. Are you okay? You seem nervous. Oh. You know, haunted house. Scary stuff. Something tells me you've seen scarier. What tells you that? I don't know, I mean, it's a feeling I have. You seem mysterious. But in a totally good way. What would you say if I told you I was friends with two ghosts that were trying to find their parents that were kidnapped by an evil spirit? I'd say... I... You better call me next time. Hey, great game today, Max. Thanks, Mrs. Hepplewhite. So, how was it? Boring, right? Tara? Hey, there he is. Ha-ha! Son, I can't tell you how proud I was of you today. But I can show you. Head upstairs to your room. I got a little surprise waiting for you. Mr. Secret Weapon. Shall we go up? Oh! Computer's back. Sweet! Now I can finally get back to researching our dad's journal. We're closer than ever to finding our morn and dad. But how will we know if Emma was able to find them? You gotta be patient, Tara. I mean, there's no telling how vast or complex the afterlife may be. It... "Nicky. Tara. "We cannot tell you how relieved we are "to know that you're okay. "Emma tells us that you're looking for us. "And I know that we will all be together again soon. "Don't ever lose hope. "We'll get through this. "We're closer than ever, "Thanks to your friend Max. "We love you more than anything. "Mom and Dad." Whoa! Max. Uh... You ran so fast. Why do I taste syrup? I'm sorry. That's a lot of syrup. ...through any of that, Mom. Sorry. No. That was great. But that was great. I was going with it. This time I know his secret. It's that ring... I can snatch the two Roland brats and we'll both be free. Simple. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I forgot my last line. I don't believe you have one. Well, that solves the problem. Echo, take one. Oh, I tore the other side. Do we keep looking? Right, Max! I totally forgot my line, Max. Oh, right, Max. Like, how did he get in the dresser then? Bye, Mauler. Too bad no one... It's hard. I wanna do it more. Oh! Oh, hey! Guys, it's just Charlie from next door. Well, keep it away from me, because I'll be in hives for a week. Come here, boy. Come here, Charlie. Come here, Charlie. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be next... All right. Come here. Come here, Charlie. Just pick him up. Just pick him up. Is he good? Yeah, yeah, just pick him up. Come here, Charlie. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be next door. See, Dad. I told you nerdy boy had a cat up here. You're dead. What? How do you wanna disappear? Oh, we're disappearing. Oh, sorry. How do you wanna do it? Um... High five. I don't know. That's all we have. What do you want?
