Jet. -I am starved. -You're always starved. Let's eat. Jennifer, phone call for you. You bitch! Did you... to think of that. I thought you said... Mom, is that you? Listen, bitch. Listen to me. You listen to me now. Listen to me. You so innocent, aren't you? Aren't you, you... -Stop it. -Sweet and so innocent. Mama, please stop it. Smiling little child whore! Whore! Bitch! I hate you! You listen to me. Didn't know? Didn't know? Doing that all the time! You filthy little smiling slut! Mama? Wonder where they are. -Damn it! -That guy did it on purpose. Will you look at this? Jenny? Hi, daddy. How's mama? She's hanging on. Papa, this is Stuart. Mr. Russell, I'm very sorry. Call me Bob. Well, I guess you want to get home and clean up, huh? No. I want to see mama. Mama? It's me. I don't know what I could've done wrong... but whatever it was, I'm sorry. And I love you. Bye. I'll see you tomorrow. Mama, are you OK? There's something wrong. What's the problem, Margaret? Nothing serious. She just needs a bedpan. Stuart, will you help me change her, please? -Certainly. -Jennifer, would you excuse us? Hello, Mrs. Russell. Just loosen that sheet. You know, to tell you the truth, I don't do a lot of this myself. You get used to it. I spent fifteen years getting used to it. My mother was a stroke victim. Now if you lift her up, I'll get rid of this. Easy. That's it. Yes, sir, fifteen years. Two or three times a day. The washing machine never stopped. Oh, we do have nurses in this town... two of them. One of them ran off to get married, the other one drinks. So, there you go, old girl. I told you not to worry about it. That's what I'm here for. Thank you, Stuart. See that fence? That's where our land starts. Why are you stopping, daddy? Those tracks weren't there yesterday. Who the hell's been up there? Let's go home. Eddie! It's OK, honey. It's all right. It's OK. I hope the accommodations are OK, Stuart. It may not be what you're used to. Oh, don't worry on my account. I'll sleep like a log tonight. I fixed up the spare down the hallway for you. So, what's your specialty, Stuart? Well, I'm a surgical resident... but I've been thinking about going into research. -Get out! -I'm not afraid of you! Stop it! That's enough! I forgot how good milk could taste. Tit to table... it doesn't get any fresher. Daddy, you know I never drink that stuff. Well, that stuff put you through college, you know. Stuart's very impressed with Dr. Carr. Said mama couldn't be in better hands. Yeah. He's highly thought of locally. Well, he has fine credentials... Johns Hopkins, Harvard Medical School. He'd have been a star at Mass. General. Carr isn't that type. He's perfectly happy here in our community. Stuart's just saying his degrees are impressive, daddy. Eddie, we got company. Tell us about the earthquake. It wasn't much of an earthquake. Busted a couple of windows... gave everybody something to talk about. Cigarette smoke bother you, Stuart? No. I don't mind at all. No. Put it out anyway, Eddie. You heard what the doctor said. No problem. Come on, you two. This is ridiculous. Seems like a nice man, Stuart. You two thinking of getting married? We've talked about it. Maybe someday. It sure is good having you home again, Jenny. Were you and mama happy together? Of course we were, Jenny. It's been a good marriage. That's the truth. Why does she hate me? Oh, honey, she doesn't hate you. I know she doesn't. Relax. How do you expect me to relax... Your father's right next door. Roll over. OK. Lie on your stomach. Yes, ma'am. What is that? It's nice, huh? Witch hazel. I thought this stuff went out with Tom Sawyer. Wait until I get to the talcum. I want to do this to you. Just shut up and enjoy it. When I was little, I used to pray I'd get a heat rash... so my mama would give me a rubdown. Sometimes she'd give me one anyway... just because it felt so good. I don't understand it. Come here. What? Morning. Need any help? I think I can handle it. He sure takes his deliveries seriously, doesn't he? I wish you could talk to me. I want to understand, mama. You know what? I'm your daughter... so I know something nobody else can know... how much you love me. Come on, let's go get a malt. Last one there is a rotten egg. Come on, let's go. Hey, wait a minute. Morning. Good morning? Have a nice day. Yeah, you, too... and a wonderful life. Been keeping yourself amused? Yeah, to say the least. Mr. Anson. Hold your horses. I'll be right there. Thanks, Eddie. Still no change? Well, we all keep on hoping and praying. -How much money you got? -I only got a quarter. -What'll it be, boys? -Two ice creams, please. Why don't we make it three? I think the house can afford it. -Thanks, Mr. Anson. -Thanks. Thanks a lot. No problem. Thank you. Sorry, Mrs. Piersall, next window. I'm closing for a while. You can't. I've been waiting in this line twenty minutes. Very sorry, Mrs. Piersall. Some goddamn bank. Gladys, calm down. We can just move into the other line. I am not going to move into the other line. I've been waiting here for twenty minutes. I couldn't believe it. I'm so sorry. It's all right. Oh, Gladys, that is unreasonable. Well, Stuart, Margo. Do you think that's unusual? Happens all the time. No. That's right. You... That's my balance, right? Well, sure. Well, I guess that takes care of it. Thank you, Janet. See you next week. -Same time, same station. -Great. Thank you. -I saw what you did. -So what? You took that money. -What if I did? -Give me that purse. I want to look inside that purse! Sorry. -You can't do that! -Why not? Because it belongs to the bank. So? Who cares? Come on. Don't be so selfish. Don't be ridiculous. Get your hands off my purse. -Wait. -Stop! Nobody's going anyplace, Mrs. Piersall. You, too, Mr. Biederman. Glad to see you, sheriff. Put the gun away, Ned. Theodore, what's that you got in your hand? That's my Christmas club money. The girl that I love so... Give me a pitcher, Bird Eye. Mary, what are you doing here? Oh, just having a drink. You know my sister Dawn and my brother-in-law Pete. I got waylaid at the bar, if you'll pardon the expression. Are you leaving? I just got here. No. He gets up when a lady comes in. A what? I'm just kidding, Stu. I think that's really sweet. -Where's Bill? -Bill who? Bill is my husband of, lo, these many years. I left him bleeding to death on the living room carpet. I didn't, but I should have. Excuse the girl talk, OK, Stuart? Why don't you visit? I'm going to get some more wine. Thank you. We're going to take a short break. We'll be back in about fifteen minutes. You all right? What, Margo? What's the matter? Is Bill the problem? No, I'm the problem. I've been having nightmares. And awful... they don't ever stop. Hey, do me a favor and don't touch me, OK? It's just the way I feel right now. I'm sorry. I can't help it. May I have this dance? Do you mind waiting for the next one, Howard? Well, I'd like to cut in now, if you don't mind. Next one, Howard, huh? How come you think you're better than me? I don't. You know, you always have. You always have. Easy, Howard, easy. What do you think you're taking it, asshole? Just back off, huh, will you? Back off. You'd never go out with me, would you? You just didn't think I was good enough, did you? Did you? You slut! Jennifer! You never felt real pain, have you, Jennifer? You want to see real pain? Howard, you can go home now. If it gives you any trouble, call me. Otherwise, I'll see you in two weeks. OK. Thank you very much, Dr. Carr. You, too, doctor. Life can be so sweet On the sunny side of the street There's a place. You pig! You pig! That's my parking place! God, I think I took her spot. Hey, I'm sorry. I'll move out. Hey, relax! Just relax! -I said I'd move! -Look out! Move! Lucky it's no more than a concussion. How did it happen? It was unbelievable. She just... she kept ramming into us. Think this could be a variant of Tourette's syndrome? I doubt it. The development's way too fast. No, thank you. There's no facial twitching... and as far as we know, no genetic history. What are you talking about? That this could be some kind of a disease. It's as if the censor in people has disappeared... so they're acting on any urge that comes along... instead of censoring out the unacceptable ones. You ever get mad when someone took your parking place? Well, sure, but I don't go around sma... But that's crazy. That's just crazy. There's one thing to be said for all this. It gives us something to do besides shuffling bedpans. There's something wrong with the phones. I've been getting busy signals all morning. The door's locked. It doesn't look like there's anybody here. Well, that's strange. It's Emmy Jones' shift. She hasn't missed a day in thirty years. Watch out. The main line must be down. What the hell's going on? Won't find anything wrong with this water. I'd let my three-year-old daughter drink it. You don't mind if I test it anyway, do you? Help yourself. I told you. I'd let my three-year-old drink it. Something wrong, Margaret? What did you say, Margaret? No. I couldn't quite hear you. Dr. Carr. Right away. -Hi, Shawn. Where's your mom? -Out. Her car's in the garage, Shawn. You don't fool me. Why aren't you in school? Margo? Upstairs! I brought you some candy. You feeling any better today? Sure. Thanks. Now, hold still. Put your finger there. Not you, Jennifer. -What happened? -Jimmy sprained his wrist. Broke it. It's sprained. I told you. Now take a hike. It's been a bad morning. -I got to do the kids' rooms. -You OK? Of course I'm OK. Why wouldn't I be OK? You left last night without saying anything, and we were... I'm fine. God damn it, no. -Shawn! Shawn! -What? I told you to clean up your room! I wish they'd clean up their rooms. Is that unreasonable? Is that asking too much? I want to talk to you. If it's bad news, I don't want to hear it. I've got enough problems with Jimmy's broken wrist. I thought he sprained it. Well, he did sprain it. -That's what I said. -No, you said... What are you asking me about his wrist for? What difference does it make? Margo, please, calm down. Let's talk, OK? Well, then what'd you start for? You're the one that started talking about it. -What are you looking at? -What happened, Margo? Tell me how Jimmy broke his wrist. Never mind. Tell me how Jimmy broke his wrist. Why do you keep asking me that? -Why are you yelling at me? -I said never mind! Mind your own fucking business! Kids, come on. I want you all to come with me. Come on. Get in the car. I'm going to take you to my place. Come on, let's go! Jimmy, come on! You can ride in the front. Hurry up. Get in. Shawn, get in. You think that's funny? That what you've done is a joke? What made you do such a stupid thing? Come on, tell me! They let all the air out of my tires. You think it's easy having kids? Little shit. Fuck it. Open the door, you little brats! Somebody please help me! Margo, help! Margo, please help! Margo, please! Oh, God. Come on. Please, come on. Come on. Jesus Christ! Bye! Come back again! That's your way of saying "Good afternoon," Margaret? It's not very attractive, if you want the truth. Still need a bedpan, Margaret? No, no, we're way past that... way past that. Dr. Carr? Mama? Take two of these now and then one every four hours. They'll help you rest. I'm only giving you six. They're very strong. Bob will be fine. I told him just take it easy for a while. Doctor, may I speak with you for a minute? Now, what about the autopsy? It's as I feared. Bob said no. He wants Margaret buried in peace. I don't think he understands how important this is. We can't do a goddamn thing without those tissue samples. It's against Bob and Margaret's religious principles. I just don't see any point... in putting them through all this, do you? We have got to have them. I think we've about covered it, doctor. Isn't he ever going to leave? Let's go in anyway. You think you ought to wait outside? I need some help. Get me some test tubes with the labels. -You better not watch. -I can handle it. Christ. She's cyanotic. -What? -No oxygen. She died of lack of oxygen. The respirator must've stopped. No. It was still running. I heard it. Jenny. We're leaving. What about him? We're taking him with us. I hope this constant smoking isn't offending anyone. I'd stop if I could. What will they do with me? Legally, I don't know... but, medically, you're our best chance. Finish my days as a specimen? Sounds exciting. Don't get carried away. Somebody sure has been busy. They don't want anybody coming or going. I swear I seen him come down this way. -Sheriff! -Not now. I'm busy. There he is! Sheriff, wait! Please, wait! Wonderful singing, Ed. I can't tell you how much I appreciate... what you've done, John. Margaret loved this church. Well, Margaret was a wonderful person, Bob. We all share your loss. Look out! Jesus Christ! I'm going to teach that little bastard... -not to crack parking meters. -Sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff, who the fuck you think you are? I didn't work all my life... just to watch some goddamn son of a bitch destroy my store. You asshole. I'm going to blow your fucking head off. Asshole? -Watch out! -That was a good one! Dad! Well, nothing's wrong here. Shit. I checked the news on the car radio. Hell, they're talking like nothing's happened. The rest of the world either doesn't know or give a damn. It's getting a little nippy outside. If you need a jacket... why don't you go grab one of mine? Goddamn. I knew I should've burned them. Jenny? -You all right? -Yeah. I needed some air. Do you want me to leave, or do you want me to stay? Stay. You feel good. But not now, OK? Later. Who's to know? Everything OK, daddy? I'd rather you two weren't out here. Good night. Good night. Oh, my God. That's what I thought, too. I want you to see something else. Easy, easy. Jenny, easy. You're still just a little bit shaken. I'm sorry. I should've anticipated the shock. It's going to be OK. You OK? Oh, good. I'm going to get you some water, OK? I'll be right back. It's OK, honey. It's me. It's me. -He killed Eddie. -What are you saying? He killed Eddie! He killed him! Don't go! It's OK, Jenny. Look, you're going to have to give me a hand here. Jenny, start the engine. Oh, come on, will you? Jennifer, the door's locked. I can't do it for you. God damn it, will you do what I say? Please? Put it in first. We'll rock it back and forth. Don't give it too much gas. OK. Now go. Come on. That's it. Come on. Kick it over again. We got it. That's it! There was some kind of toxic spill. It got into the milk. You got to get out of here. What's the use? No! Don't open the door! I can't be sure of myself. I'm going to go back into town and see if I can help. Now go on, get out of here! Well, why won't you come with me? Whatever it is, I've got it, and you don't. You don't know that... not for certain. Please, Stuart, come with me. You're all I have left. Please. I'll join you as soon as I can. You promise? I promise. I love you. I am sure am glad you could help us out today. It's the worst I've ever seen it. We could lose every tree in town. No problem. Happy to oblige you guys. Is this it? Yep. It's heavy, though. Let me give you a hand. Is that where you want me to spray? Roger that, and when you're done... proceed north by northeast ten degrees. Ninety-nine Yankee to ground. Ground. Go ahead. Over the town. What town? Spray it. You're freaking out, ground. Repeat. I didn't read you. I said spray the town. You sure about that? I thought you said the outlying areas only. I'm sure about it. Here goes, then. Well, what about Main Street? There's a lot of people down there. Main Street, too. OK, you're the boss. Ninety-nine Yankee, clear. What are you doing here? Hey, pal, don't worry. I'm here to help you people. Nobody's going to get hurt. Nothing's going to happen. There's been a little accident. We're just here to clean things up, that's all. Who are you? Any unit with the last known location... of unit G-73-99, come in to control. G-seven-three-niner-niner. Go ahead. G-73-99, what's your status? The medfly is dead. I'm returning to base. G-73-99, roger. Looking for these? Come on, I haven't got time to play around. Just hand 'em over, OK? You're not going anywhere, pal. You're staying right here with me. I'm serious. Give me the keys. You're just going to have to find them. Shit! Done by (c) dCd / June 2005
