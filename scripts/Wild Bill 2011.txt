(RINGING CONTINUES) DEAN: Hello? - Who was it? - Wrong number. I'm still ill! Maybe you shouldn't have got munted on a school night. They're all gimps at that school. Well, you'll fit right in then, won't you? Funny! Go on. What you doing? Dropped my pen! Get in there, stop messing about! (SIGHS) Dad! - Dad! - Granddad! Granddad! Oh, bollocks! Oi! You're getting worse! - Hat! Goggles! - Yeah. Come on, hurry up. Jonas, where am I putting these, mate? JONAS: Over there on the right. RAJ: Here, love. Take this and give my best to T. You don't have to pay me or nothing. No, love, it's a tenner. It's for a cab. Right. Thanks. - Homework, yeah? - Yeah. Double Kick-Ass, is it? Where'd you get the comic from anyway? JIMMY: Swapped it. For what? You ain't got nothing to swap it with. Fags. Fags! Where'd you get fags from? - Swapped 'em! - For what? Trainers! I've told you, no nicking! Not nicking! Swapping! What we got for dinner? Toast. Oh, I'm gonna get the right piss taken out of me now! Yeah, well, you do the washing then! I'm not going to school till I get another shirt! (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hold on, stay there. - JIMMY: Who is it? - Shh. Hello? Hello? - Hello, mate. - What? I'm just looking for the people that live opposite. And? And do you know if they still live there? A woman and two kids? I don't know nothing. Flat is empty. Now fuck youse! DICKIE: Got another little skank up the duff now, have you, you dirty bastard? Ain't you created enough misery in your life? Have a word. What you doing? Oh, come on, T! Sorted out the turban for you, didn't I? And what? Not till I say so! (MOBILE PHONE RINGING) Yeah? Make it good. Yeah, hello, T. You sure? - Well, stone me! - You all right, Keith? I thought I barred you for life. Sure that weren't some other geezer? Nah, yeah. It was me, yeah. Seems like only yesterday you got sent down. Bloody hell, time flies, dunnit? Not inside, it don't. The usual? Ten pints, two grams and a punch-up? Seriously, no trouble, right? All right. I'm out on license. If my dog shits on the pavement, I get 18 months. I mean, she's like a proper skepler, I tell you. Her face was all roughed up and shit. I mean, I bashed it... All right? Can't say I've seen them for a while, me old son. I knocked next door. Some big Russian lump come out and coated me off. Probably a Polish builder. People have got the 'ump that they're here. I don't mind them. Don't mind getting their hands dirty. British kids would much rather sing like a bender in front of Simon Cowell. I don't suppose you'd know who he is, would you? No, course I do. It was our favourite programme in jail. Run a book on it and everything. Sounds like you miss it already. (SCOFFS) Do I, fuck! I ain't never going back, mate. It nearly killed me. Oi! What the fuck you doing in my boozer? You what? (CHUCKLES) See, what did I tell you? Geezer's a top-class nut job! Yeah, back in the day, yeah. Look at him. Wild Bill! Bill. It's me, T. Little Terry? Yeah. Well, no. Everyone calls me T now. Who was he? Social worker? Don't know. Arsehole. What'd he look like? Like nothing. He look like arsehole. Um, look, you got any sugar? I've got medus, honey. Yo, Victor! One sec. Yo, Victor! So what you gonna be doing, now you're out? Might go up north. Do a bit of graft on the oil rigs. - Up north? - Sod that. Come work for me, Bill. Good money in it, thanks to all the Bobski the Builders who've moved into the area. They're all bang on it. Next year we're gonna make a killing. We got the Olympics coming, innit. These are boom times for everyone in the borough, Bill, not just the javelin shops! Go on. Weigh him in. Safe! T: Here, hold that. Set yourself up. Stick it on the slate. No, here y'are. Look, I can't. T: Don't insult me, Bill, just take it. Oi, oi. Good girl. Come on, then! Get it down ya! You're gonna need some fortifications! (ALL CHUCKLING) What? I got you a present. Dunno if you remember Roxy. - All right, Bill. - She's proper filth, mate. You can do anything with her. Absolutely anything! There ain't many who ain't, is there, babe? T: Work it, girl! Work it, girl! That's it! Look at him! He don't know what to do with it! Is that for me? (BANGING ON DOOR) PILL: Open up. Open the fucking door! - (BANGING CONTINUES) - Come on! I wanna go home! DICKIE: Here, look. PILL: Come on, we know you're in there! Open the fucking door, we ain't going back! Stay there. Stay there. Open the door! (BANGING CONTINUES) PILL: About time. DEAN: Wait, who are you? What's going on? - DICKIE: Get the light on. - You can't come in here. - Seriously, what's going on? - PILL: You got it, yeah? Someone tell me what is going on. DEAN: Here, hang on, boys. Who's that? That? That is your old man! He's a fucking legend! Come on, soppy bollocks. He stinks. Great! (BILL MUMBLES) (BILL GROANS) Where am I? DEAN: That's funny. 'Cause we were wondering the same thing for the last eight years. Is it really him? Looks like it, yeah. Dean? My God! Look at you. James? Everyone calls him Jimmy now and he don't remember you. All right. You all right, Jimmy? Uh, any more of that going? I'll give you some dough towards it. Don't worry. You already did. Jimmy, get your coat. Go. BILL: So, when's she coming back? - Ask her. - Where is she? Spain, with Jeff. Spain? How long ago was this? - Years. - Nine months. Well, why aren't you with her? Jeff! What? She just left you? What, and you didn't? Here, hold on. I didn't have no choice! That's not what she said! Bitch! Oi, that's our mum you're talking about! All right, well... She ain't a very good mum, is she? What d'you know about it, eh? What d'you know about anything? Look, I'm just saying. Yeah, well, don't. 'Cause we're not interested in what you have to say. We're not interested in what you think. You are nothing to us! Get what you need and go. I don't wanna see you here when I get back. Come on. (DOOR SLAMS) - Okay, no problem. Be calm. - Don't tell me to be calm, right! Move 'em from there to... Dean, get here! - I want those shifted. - Okay, okay. Look, Roland, I'm sorry, mate. It won't happen again. That's not good enough. Listen, I'm sticking my neck out just having you on site. Yeah, I've got some grief at home. Yeah, and that's my problem because what? Come here. Look, I know you're doing your best, right, and I'll help you out as much as I can, but you're going to have to help me, yeah? - Yeah, course. - You in tonight? Yeah. Right, I'm going to drop some more stuff off. Okay. Well, go on, then. Grab yourself a shovel. Build us a velodrome. - Four sugars. - BILL: Thanks. So, how was your trip home? Uneventful. Isle of Wight? Yeah, Park Hill. Eight years, two months and three days for... carrying a concealed weapon, supplying class A's, three counts of actual bodily harm, four grievous and the attempted murder of a community support officer. Well, that's colourful. Sounds a lot worse than what it was. Seen the family yet? A bit. - How was it? - All right. - Boys all right? - Yeah, they're good, yeah. They're, um, bigger. Are you back with your wife, domestically speaking? Nah, she's with Jeff, domestically speaking. I see. How do you feel about that? Don't know. Fucking relieved. I'm going up to Scotland anyway. That's a good idea. Make a fresh start. Out of harm's way. Just need to find you someone to talk to up there. All right. Lovely. And we should arrange a meeting with Diane. Talk about your contact with the boys. And then we're done. Shouldn't be too difficult, she's been in Spain for the last nine months. Oh. So who's looking after them? What d'you mean? Well, it says here that Dean's 15 and Jimmy's 11 and they're attending school in Newham, so who's taking care of the boys? Well, you know, they've had neighbours looking in. You know. Well, Jimmy's only 11. He needs an adult looking after him. They both do. They look fine to me. Bill, they're children. No, Dean's like, he... He's very grown up for his age. Know what I mean? I am going to have to inform Child Services about this. They need to look into it. Right. You do realise what this means, don't you? Yeah. Yeah. They'll need looking after. Kids don't do well in care, Bill. You know that. They're better off with their parents. Don't stick it on me. I can't look after 'em. Me pal's waiting for me in Scotland. It's all organized. Bill, you're their dad. I don't really know 'em. Hello, yeah, can you put me through to John in Child Services, please. (SIGHS) The social are on their way round. What have you said'? Me PO was asking about your mum and I said she ain't about, that's all. So you grassed us up? Look, I never grassed no one up. Just sort of slipped out. Oh, well, that's all right then. You weren't going to get away with it forever. We were doing fine until you showed up, Bill! You're not going. No. No, you're going to stay here and you're gonna sort this out and you're going to tell the social you're looking after us. Just stay till Mum gets back. I told you she ain't coming back! I don't think I can, son. No? Then I'm going to tell the Old Bill that you're dealing. Hmm. Don't be stupid. I've got your coke. Right, well, you better give me that back now. No. I'm gonna grass on you. Just like you grassed on us. And they will bang you up again, Bill. I ain't going back to prison. Yeah, and we ain't going into care. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) I'm serious. You owe us. BILL: As soon as I found out their mum weren't about, I weren't going nowhere. Know what I mean? JOHN: You need to start telling us the truth, all right? So we know what we're dealing with. Now, your probation officer was under the impression you were going away? Look, I've had a think about it and I've changed my mind. Is that all right? Right, well, now that you are staying, we're not going to instigate an emergency response, but we are gonna begin an investigation under Section 47. Look, I love my kids and I'm gonna be here. What more do you want'? A lot, actually. Do you mind if I call you Bill? Yeah, I do. Actually. All right. We're going to need to take a little look around. Fill your boots. So, you're not going up north, then? Mr. Hayward, have you got a moment? Yeah, I'll run a cloth over that. Mr. Hayward, this is a clear case of neglect. You need to take your parental responsibilities seriously or your kids will be taken away from you. I understand. I'll get onto it. Helen. We're done here. Mr. Hayward. Dean seems to be coping, but I'm worried about James. I'll keep an eye on him. Yeah, that'd be good. How does he feel about being abandoned by his mum? - Don't know. - Well, how do you think he feels? Have you spoken to him about it? - No. - Maybe you should. All right, I will. Thanks for stopping by, yeah. Well, look, we're going back to the office, but we really need as much information as possible to build the bigger picture. We're going to need to speak to his teachers and his doctor. - You know who his doctor is, right? - Not really, no. Well, then you're going to have to find out. And we're going to have to speak to the police. - About what? - Your kids. It's to decide whether we need to convene a case conference. Look, I'll drop by in the next couple of days, see how you're getting on. All right. Sweet. Thanks very much, Mr. Hayward. And, oi. Do something about that flat. 'Happy? - No! (BILL SIGHS) So what did they say? They're coming back in a couple of days. They need some time to make a decision. Okay. So you need to be here. All right, I get it! Yeah, and you can leave as soon as they're off our backs. Don't worry, I will. Good. You get the sofa. Good! (WHISPERS) Fucking dickhead! Have a good one. I was gonna get some chicken. Get some rice. Make a nice curry. Lost me wallet. (TAPPING ON WINDOW) Why haven't you taken the baby to my fucking mother's? You know what she's like. - You fucking bitch! I'll knock you out! - Shut up. Don't you fucking go away from me! I'll knock you out! Come on. Mummy take you out. You too, you old drunk! Just ignore him, Dad. He'll go away. Don't stay in bed all day. Make sure Jimmy gets to school. JIMMY: He's the bully. He started it! I always get in trouble for this kind of stuff. Well, that's just how it goes. James! - You must be Mr. Hayward? - Yeah. Children's Services have been in touch about you. Oh, have they? Yeah. I'm really glad you popped by, actually. I'd be really keen for you to come and have a chat. All right, well, I'll pop in when I ain't so busy. Ta. Yesterday afternoon some of the kids that were marked down as absent turned up at the school and smashed all of the windows in the music block. Where were you, James? He was with me all afternoon. - Really? - Yeah. Have you any idea of the cost of the damage? Look, I just told you, he was with me all afternoon. We went to see his nan. She's not well. My nana's going to heaven. It's funny, 'cause I'm usually informed about these things. He don't like talking about it. He's been really upset. Look, whoever smashed your windows, it weren't him. This is serious, Mr. Hayward. James' behaviour is a real concern. So I will be expecting that visit. I'll see you soon. BILL: Right, in you go, trouble. So you're staying, then? For the time being, yeah. Good. (BANGING ON DOOR) Give me the drugs! Where are the drugs? (LAUGHING) Go on, go get yer coat on. T's waiting. Oi! Where we going? See a dog about a man. Liven up! Wait here. All right, Glen. I'm not late, am I? No, I just like to get to sit-downs early. Right. So, what's the matter? Nothing. Anything the matter with you? No. At least, I don't think so. Okay, you're doing well. Huh? That's good, innit? Like to hear that. Success. But be warned, it can be a double-edged sword, expansion. I mean, we like big deals. Bigger the better. But, uh... slow and considered, yeah? 'Cause remember, you're not the only franchise in the area that we're supplying. And the last thing we want is a gunfight at the OK Corral. Understand? Yeah, of course. Got it with you now? Don't be stupid. Come to you in a couple of days. GLEN: He's with you, is he? Wild Bill? Yeah, he's just got out. Thought he might be handy to have around, you know. He used to shift a lot of gear back in the day. Most of it up his own nose. If he gives you trouble, you let me know. Who, Bill? Nah, he's sweet as! Him and my brother went way back, didn't they? There ain't enough room for the pair of ya. - Right. - Keep an eye on him, all right? Yeah. Be smart and we'll all make a lot of money. Good money on the rigs, is it? Yeah, it's supposed to be. Like, I ain't ruled it out yet. - Know what I mean? - Sweet. When you thinking of going? Soon as. Fair play. I've heard it's bang on. Good food, birds flown out every weekend. What, on the oil rigs? Yeah. You'd be a mug not to go, Bill. Aie-aie. Here come the other people. Can we have two cups of tea? - Hello, Mr. Ball. - Fuck off! That is charming, that is. Richard. Hello, Bill. All right, Jack! Enjoy your holidays? Yeah, it was all right. Food weren't all that. Can I have a word? Aren't you getting a bit old for all this? It ain't doin' me heart any good if that's what you mean. Associating with known criminals. Straight back in it then, eh? No, what it was. I was... I was just walking past the cafe and I thought I'd pop in and get a bacon sandwich. Save it! Now, I'm gonna let it slide this time. But I don't wanna see you with them again. - Thanks, mate. - I'm not your mate. Ooh, look, there's your bus. KELLY: Excellent. I think you made the right choice. John's not so sure, but Helen's really positive. So, have you thought about getting a job? Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna sign on. No, get a job, and the sooner the better. It would go a long way to convincing Child Services that you're serious. John can be a bit of a stickler. (SIGHS) Yeah, all right. It's important, Bill. It's so easy to fall back into bad habits, and you know where that leads to. So... No associating with known criminals, no excessive drinking and... - No drugs. - Exactly. It's a big turnaround for you. You should be proud of yourself. It's good! (DOOR OPENS) - Go on then, Jim. - Yeah, watch. - Ooh! - Whoa, it's a dive-bomber. All right, son, watch and learn. What, 'cause yours is gonna be any better, is it? Watch and learn. JIMMY: Whoa! How'd you learn how to do that? - (BILL LAUGHING) - That is quality! BILL: That's goin' to Stoke Newington, that is. (INAUDIBLE) (JIMMY IMITATING PLANE DIVING) (BILL LAUGHING) BILL: Yeah, lam! JIMMY: How did you get yours to go... BILL: You cheeky monkey! All right. Start again. Right. Ready? Come round here. Ready? Come on, I'm dying to go. You all right? (WATCH TICKING) And I keep saying like, point blank, like I'm not gonna do it! Oi, Steph. - You all right'? - All right, Dean. Working hard? No, not really. What you up to? Going to George's dad's house. His nan wants to see him. Right. That all right, is it? Yeah, no, that's cool. Come on, Steph. If you don't ask, you'll never know. (WORKERS SHOUTING) James Hayward, Craig Boswell, come here now! Watch and learn, mate. Go on. Anyone you want. All right, listen, pal. Best I can do, right. Three pound an hour, give you 20 minutes for lunch. Right. Well, it ain't fucking brain surgery, is it? I mean, do you want the job or not? I've gotta crack on. (WHINING) - (PHONE RINGING) - Hang on, one minute. Hello? Hello, Barry, you all right? Come on, Arch. Archie. How you been, mate? I'm gonna sort him out, yeah. - Sweet. - Oi, Pill. Ah, what a'gwan? Get us some Breezers, geezer. All right. Shrapnel? All right. Then you can do something for me, innit. Get him some Breezers, geezer! - Jimmy, innit? - Fuck is this? Yeah, and I'm Boz. Wanna make some money? Yeah, course. Change, boys. Here, watch Pill. He goes mental when he hears this one. (DRUM 'N' BASS MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) See there, boys? That's why you should only sell the drugs. (LAUGHING) Give us that here, mate. Here you are, Jim. Have a go. - (COUGHING) - (LAUGHING) Have another go, mate. Go on, take it down. (SIGHS) Oi, little man. Don't forget to give Pill a call, yeah? Yeah, course. Sweet, T. Good lad. (ENGINE STARTS) What you been up to? Nothing. What's happened to the bog? (CHUCKLES) Right, come on, grub's up! What's this? Shepherd's pie. Made from real shepherds. It's good. Cheers, Dad. You all right? How was your day? There's some food here if you want it. You playing happy families? What's up with him? It's his birthday, innit. Is it? Oh, fuck! Hey, penis boy! - What? - The girl you like. She's downstairs. - Eh? - She's downstairs. Go. I cover. - All right, cheers, mate. - Go. Hi, Steph. - Hello. - You look nice. I heard your dad's back. Yeah, well, good news travels fast. Must be weird. How long was he away for? Don't know, ages. He's a mug anyway. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Dad reckons he used to be a bit of a nutter. Yeah, well, runs in the family. Look, so do you wanna go out Sunday? Um, Sunday's a bit difficult. Oh, yeah. Right. I'll have to leave George with me dad. Yeah, yeah. No, I suppose not, then. Doesn't work. Your hair's getting long. You should come round and I'll trim it. Yeah, well, I had to get Jimmy's new uniform, so it skinted me out. Of course, Jimmy's at big school now, isn't he? Yeah, well, every now and again. You should come round anyway. I'll do you a mates' rate. Yeah, how much is that? Dunno. You'll have to make me an offer. Oi! Romeo! Get back to work! Well, I'll see you then. You know where to find me. Yeah, sure. He wants me to drive over to him for a oner. I went, "Yeah, I'll drive over, mate "I'll drive over, stick your windows through and smash the lamp over your face, ya mug." Is he takin' the piss? Oh, fuck! Excuse me, mate, do you know where there's a shoe sale round here? - What you doing? - I'm working. Is it still called work when you're not actually moving? Good money, is it? Not really, but I enjoy a challenge. What 'appened? Run out of oil up north, did they? Slight change of plan. You should disappear like we said. Making people uncomfortable, Bill. It's bad for business, yeah? You're seen hanging around, people are gonna want to open you up. And I'd hate to see such an old mate of me brother's get hurt. I'll be invisible. You won't even see me. Hardly. Mate, ain't that your boy? Oi, Dean! Dean! Come here. - What? - Come on. I said come on. - All right, son. - Have you seen this? You must be proud as punch, boy! What's your dad do? He's a boxer. What's your dad do? He's an astronaut. What's your dad do? He's a fuckin' signpost! Have a word, what you reckon, Dickie? I couldn't do it. I expect to see you gone by the end of the week. (SCOFFS) Come on. Get on the matching smothers, Dean! (LAUGHING) See you at home. (SIGHS) (SNIFFS) Bicarbonate of soda. What's this, then? Hello, again! (CHUCKLES) Bill, innit? Do you remember me from the other night? Roxy. Yeah. I was your welcome-home present. Oh, sorry, I didn't, um... - I didn't recognise ya. - (CHUCKLES) 'Ere, did we, um...? Did we...? You know. Don't you remember? Five times, at least. You were like a barn door in a hurricane. Yeah? (CHUCKLES) No, I'm only joking! You didn't have a pulse most of the evening. - (SNIFFS) - Sorry. It's all right. I'll keep it on t'slate for you if you like. - Yeah? - (CHUCKLES) Are you on the game, then? Blimey, you know all the lines, don't ya! Oi, do you know anything about baking? What it was, I missed me son's birthday. - I was gonna, like, um... - Bake him a cake? - Yeah. - How old is he? Sixteen. Sixteen? And you're baking him a cake! Well, yeah... I mean, that was the plan. (CHUCKLES) I'm sure he'll be blown away by it. Are you getting him an Action Man an' all? - All right? - All right. Oh, look, I don't mean to tease or nothing, but 16? Your little boy's gone, me darling. He's a man now. Excuse. - What are you doing? - Nothing. I'm waiting. - For what? - Nothing. Yeah, well, you can wait for nothing at home! Come on. (MOUTH ES) (GROANING) I've got a surprise for you. What? Quit work after just one day? Brilliant surprise. No, I felt bad about missing your birthday. Which one? I got you a little present. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, it's in your room. Uh, not you. Here y'are, that's yours there. Come in! I won't bite. Who's that? She's a friend. She's got Dean's present for him. Oh, yeah? Your dad said it's your birthday. It was. Well, guess what? It still is! - What are they doing? - Nothing. Get your coat, we're going for a walk. Oh, no! I wanna know what they're doing! Exactly, that's why we're going for a walk. Grab your coat, bring your doughnut. Get her out! I want her out now! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the problem? Are you mad or something? You brought a brass back to have sex with me in me own mum's bed! Well, they were all out of Action Man! (GASPS) I want her out. Hello, Dean. Is this a bad time? That's very good, Mr. Hayward. Wow, I wish my kitchen was that clean. Yeah... Er, it's the bathroom. Yeah, I can see that. Yeah, Jimmy's room. Had a little tidy up in there. - The toilet's looking nice, Mr. Hayward. - Yeah, yeah. Toilet. Yeah. Call me Bill. Yeah, no, er, John will be really pleased. Oh, good, yeah. Well, send him my regards, won't ya? Yeah. Um, can I...? - That's... That's Dean's bedroom. - Yeah, I know. Can I take a look? Well, I don't mind, but he, he might be a bit uncomfortable with it. You know what teenage boys are like. Right, well, I'll... I'll save that for next time. Come and say bye to Helen. She's off now. I'm really pleased, Bill. Big improvement. Well, good. Well, pop by any time. - Um, what were you arguing about? - Arguing? Yeah, when I arrived. Those raised voices? What was it about? Oh, that, yeah. Dean didn't really like his birthday present. - Oh, no. What was that? - An old bike. (STIFLES GIGGLE) - Crack it open then, Pill. - See that lump. Has that gone through? Ahh, yeah! - I can smell that already. Proper. - Yeah. Making me need a pony! (LAUGHING) - There, that's a proper shine. Look. - There, look at that. (DOOR SLAMMING) - Is that you, Rox? - Yeah. - About fucking time. - I got the baking soda. Jesus, how much is that? This, my angel, is one brick. Share the taste! This is my mortgage, darlin'! You wouldn't ask a bank manager if he had any money he didn't want. Don't stand there gawping, babe! Put a pan on, let's cook this shit up! Too right, mate! (FUNK MUSIC PLAYING) This one's bubbling. (INAUDIBLE) (INAUDIBLE) (CHATTERING) (GIRLS SHOUTING) Dirty bitch. (WHISTLES) - Lovely, mate. - There you go. - All right? - Ta, ta. All the best. That's a nice little piece. Good afternoon, Mr. Hayward. (BURST OF SIREN) For fuck's sake. - Stay here, yeah? - Oi, Boswell. Come 'ere. - What are you doing? - I ain't doing nuffin', bruv. - What did you stop me for? - Past your bedtime, innit? - Who's your mate? - He's no one, mate. It's just a mug, innit. How's about I take you down the station, search the pair of ya? What would I find? You won't find nothing, mate. We ain't got nothing on us. I know what you're like, Boswell. If you're out, you're up to no good, ain't ya? Not necessarily. What can you tell me about some trainers? - What trainers? - You tell me. I don't know fuck all about any trainers. - Don't ya? - Nah, mate. Stop pissing about. What did you really pull me over for? Stop me having a nice evening, know what I mean? - Why don't you go home, hey? - Why don't you piss off back to the nick? You need to watch your mouth. - You owe me! - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Shut up! (GROANING) T! Please! Come on, leave him alone, T. T, I didn't... Please! - T! - You gonna run to your dad? - (LIFT CLOSES) - (GROANS) Thanks, mate. You really hurt that lad before, you know, T. Yeah, it's a jungle out there. He's a little sweetie, you shouldn't have him like that. Oh, no, I should've wrote him a little letter or something. Oh, come off it, how old is he? What 10, 11? I don't give a shit how old he is! He works for me. We're trying to make money, like a business. You're not really grasping this whole sort of situation are you, girl? How it works and that? You don't just give out loads of gear and loads of money and let them run off into the hills, and go, "Oh, well, never mind, eh?" Well, why are you working with a 10-year-old anyway? Erm, let's think. Maybe 'cause the Old Bill can't nick 'em! - I don't wanna listen to it off ya! - It's got nothing to do with me, T. I'm talking about the kid. Will you leave me alone? - Your coaching him in brass! - Fuck off! Ooh! Don't tell me to fuck off! - 'Ere, where you going? - Nowhere. - Can I go? - No, go home. - Oh, go on! - No, Jim, do one, seriously. Dean, please. Mate, I'm going to Steph's. I'll see you later though, yeah? Go inside, it's cold. Cheers, mate. Say hello to Pete for me, yeah? Will do. See you in a couple of weeks, hun. Should I have booked? Nah, you're all right. Come in. I'm gonna wash your hair. - Yeah? - Yep. Get your top off. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Sorry, Bill, can I come in for a minute? Yeah, course. It's funny, hair. Every day you look in the mirror, you look the same, but leave it long enough, one day you can hardly recognise yourself. Yeah, is that right? I don't know about right, but I reckon so. Yeah? So you're a hairdresser and a philosopher, then? No, mainly a philosopher. Hairdressing is just a sideline. Terry do that? And that Dickie. They've been cooking up rocks and smoking pipes for two days. - Sounds like fun. - Evil fuckers! - Do you need a place to crash? - Would that be all right? - I know what he's like. He'll come lookin'. - Yeah, it's all right. - Let 'em blow themselves out. - Thanks. - You sure that's all right? - Yeah. It's fine. - Do you want a cup of tea? - Two sugars. Steph! I missed the train. I just... (MISERABLE MUMBLING) I don't know where me hat is. (GROANING) Don't know what I'm fucking doing. What are you doing? Steph. I'm hungry. - You all right? - Yeah. No. Don't worry about Dad. - Steph! - Yeah, okay. I gotta go. - Meet me tomorrow at the cafe? - Yeah. 11:00? - Right. See ya. - See ya. What's this? It's all I could get. You're a chip off the old block, ain't ya? Right, you'll see Pill tomorrow and you'll hold for him. I can't. I'm going... I don't give a fuck. You'll work off what you owe or I'll come round your drum and burn you and your whole family while you're sleeping, yeah? Sound fair? Now piss off! And you, you mug. What you looking at? Go on. - That's Bill's kid, isn't it? - So? We'll bury 'im. What's your favourite? Er... Is it Dollar? Their classic album. - You all right'? - What's she doing here? She just needs to stay here for a couple of days. - Are you all right with that? - No. - Dean. - What? I gave you my answer. If you're not going to listen, don't ask. - She's in trouble, mate. - Yeah. And? All right. It's all right, Bill. I'll see if Stacy'll let me stay at hers. T won't think of looking there straight off. All right. Sorry, Rox. Oi, hang on. You can stay the night tonight if you want. You sure? - Yeah, I said so, didn't I? - Ta, mate. ...and I never liked them because they were always too runny or grey. You all right, son? Cup of tea there. Ooh, very smart. Where you going? Court? - Fuck off! - Do you want some eggs? I'm all right, thanks. Oi! Jimmy! Where you off to? - Oi, Dean! - Oi... - Where's my money? - What money? You come into my house and you steal from us? Who the fuck do you think you are? Hang on, what you on about? I ain't stole nuffing! - Don't lie! - Steph, I'm not lying to ya, honestly! Who did, then? I dunno! Your old man? Unbelievable! Just because your old man's a thief, doesn't mean mine is! Oi, this is bollocks. You need to get your facts straight. I'd never do that to ya! Stay away from me. You're all the same. You, your thieving dad and your low-life brother. - Steph! - Fuck off! (WHISTLING) Jimmy! Oi, Jimmy. He's not here. Is everything all right? - No, it's not. - Why? What's he done? I think he stole money off of Steph. Oh. I'm having a cup of tea. Do you want one? Look, just, just leave me alone, yeah? Dean... I know what it's like. I left home when I were 15, so... Look, I worked my bollocks off to look after him. I know. And Jimmy can be a little shit sometimes, but... Yeah, and now I've got some old slag living in my house, who thinks she can play mum to me. I'm not trying to play mum. - I'm trying to help. - And I didn't run away from home, all right. Home ran away from me, and now Bill's come back... Your dad's a good man. If you've got a problem, you can talk to me about it. Problem shared... Everyone's a philosopher, in't they? What and let me guess, cocksucking's just a sideline, is it? You all right, Rox? You got a face as long as a kite. - Jimmy's nicked money from Steph. - What? I should've told you before. - He owes T money. - Jimmy does? - Got 'im workin'. - You what? (KNOCKING AT DOOR) I have a formal agreement I need you to sign. - All right. - Providing you adhere to the terms... Well, 'old on a second. (STAMMERING) What exactly is this? A residence order. Well, we feel it's in the boys' best interests that they remain in your care. - Really? - Absolutely! This is, er, a good thing, right? Yeah. It's great. You sign here. - Just there, yeah? - Yeah, just there and also on here. "William Hayward, the father, - "agrees to m... m... - Maintain. "...maintain, lodge, clo... - Clothe. - "...clothe and educate..." You can leave now. Yeah? Yeah. Go on, then. Right. Come on, Roxy. Let's go and find my Jimmy. That's him. - The one on the left? - Yeah. There he is. You all right? - Where's Jimmy? - All right, Wild Bill! - What the... - Do you want some? No, you fucking don't, so fuck off. No need to be hostile! Don't make me ask you again! Where's my son'? All right, blood. (WHISTLES) Oi! You! Jimmy. Come 'ere! - Oh, fuck, T's gonna go spare. - Right, listen to me, right'? My son don't work for you no more. Do you understand me? - Yeah, all right. - Yeah? T'll have something to say about that. If he don't like it, remind him what happened to his brother. Jimmy owes money. Can't just go running away. Listen to me, right. If I see you or your muggy little pals anywhere near my son again, I'm going to come looking for you first, and I'm gonna cut your head off with a bread knife. Prick! And you, fuck off! - He's fucking nuts. - Where the fuck were you, man! Take it easy, bruv. Oi! Don't you run again! Sit down! Sit your arse down! How'd you find me? Anywhere you are, don't you think I was hiding there 20 years ago? It was Boz's idea. Yeah, you can't hide behind that neither! What's in 'ere, then? Better be your homework. That's a lot of crack for such a young man. Well, you're doing well, in't ya? First year's the 'ardest. - What? - Yeah, that's what they say. First year's the 'ardest. It weren't for me. Second year, that was the real killer. First year, you can still remember the world. Your home. Your pals, Sunday roast. What it's like to take a dump without someone watchin' ya! The second year, that's when the hope starts to leave ya. No one left to trust. No one you really like 'cause you're in prison, everyone's a criminal. They all want to fuck you over. You don't wanna go to sleep, 'cause whatever you got will be nicked by the lag you share your cell with. Whose farts and stink you have to put up with, Don't wanna make friends with no one, because if you do, you make an enemy somewhere else. Nonces, who wanna 'ump ya. Oh, yeah. Bods who don't think nuffin' about creeping up behind ya with a shank and sticking it in yer throat. Do you know what the worse thing is? Do ya'? You get used to it. So, Jimbo, what are you gonna do? What d'you mean? You got a big problem. What you gonna do? I dunno. I thought... - I dunno. - It's a choice. You might think you're only young, but you ain't. You're a man in my eyes and you've got to make a choice. Are you sure you wanna run around with these muppets? Carrying on with all this caper? You're gonna end up where I've just been. Is that what you want'? No. I just wanna go home. Do you want me to help you sort this out? Okay. But you gotta understand there's a price. If you ever do this again, it's over between me and you. Do you understand me? Give me the bag of bones. - Bill. - Adam. - You all right? - I'll have to swerve that one. - Yeah, course. - Is Steph there, mate? She's not in any trouble, is she? Nah, mate, nah. I just need a quick word with her, that's all. Steph! - Oh, piss off! - Hold on! We got your money. Come on. Steph, I kinda nicked yer money. - You kinda nicked it? - I nicked yer money. - And? - And I'm sorry. Right. Listen, if it's short let me know and I'll give you the rest. You took this? He's had a few problems, but we're sorting them out. Don't hold it against him. It's my fault, really. If anyone's to blame, it's me. - How's Dean? - Yeah, he's all right. I just hope he don't murder his little brother. - Does he hate me now? - Oh, yeah. With a passion! You come here, now! Drop it out, will ya, Dean? It's all sorted, okay? - Yeah, not till I batter him, it's not. - Oi! - Just let it go, Dean, please. - Yeah, but Steph hates me now. No, she don't. And if she does, it's something you'll just have to work out. - Well, I ain't gonna forget this. - Nobody ever does. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Right, I'll get that. 'Ere y'are, look what I just found. - Hiya. - What d'you want? Right, why don't you two have a chat? - We'll go and get some Chinese. Come on. - Really? Yeah, come on. - Thanks, Bill. - That's all right. He's all right, your dad. Yeah. Yeah, I suppose he is. Come here. I'm sorry. - Are you Mad Bill? - Who's asking? - You're in deep shit. - Oh, yeah? T says the Callaghans', tomorrow at 1:00. Be there. Don't make him come looking. - Is that it'? - I'll tell him I saw ya. You do that. Go on, run along, little man. Suck my dick, batty boy! What are you lookin' at? - What did he want? - Shooting. - All set? Come on, then. - Aye. Yeah, tomorrow before 1:00. Good. What about Russ? Yeah, well, find out and let me know, yeah? All right, later on. - How many's that? - Plenty. - Since when was "plenty" a number? - Six. Not enough. Call Barry. - ROXY: Here we go. - BILL: That's it. - ROXY: Who's first? - Right. DEAN: Take a pancake and you fill it with that. - Do you know how to use them? Hey! - Hey! JIMMY: It didn't really work, but... STEPH: You haven't put any plum sauce on yer thing yet. - I made juice. - So we're eating real duck? - Is that my drink? - There's another one here. Is that my drink? - That's proper nice. - Yeah. (INAUDIBLE) Come on, lights out now, Jim. - Fucking hell. - Oi! Language! - Night, son. - Night, Dad. STEPH: (LAUGHING) Well, hurry up, then! - You all right? - Yeah. - Do you want anything? - No, I'm good. So, what you gonna do? Give him his gear and tell him to leave Jimmy alone. Right. Think that will work? We'll have to see, won't we? They've called in the firm and they'll all be tooled up. Cheers. Watch out for Dickie. He's a nutter. Fearless. And Pill carries a pepper spray and a blade. There he is. - Yo, yo. - You all right? Bill... - You all right? - Yep. Come to bed. - Where's Dad? - Er... He's had to pop out. Do you want some food? Er... Yeah. Do you know how to make flapjacks? Is he here yet? Yeah, he's under the table. What you having, lads? - Whoa, blood. - Don't talk black to me, man. Play the game. (ALL CHATTERING) (CHATTERING STOPS) I'll have a coke please, Keith. 'Ere you are. Yours, I believe? I was just about to come looking for you. - Why? Am I late? - No, just don't like ya. - It's all there. - It wants to be! Can't just go around giving people digs. Fair enough. I just wanna sort this Jimmy business out. Keeps doing one through the long grass, blood! - He's a kid. - He's a cunt. Look, you got your money, you got your gear. Just drop me son out of it now, yeah? He's retired. - All right? - Sure. He's as good as dead to me. So it's sorted, yeah? Go and drink yer pop, Billy. You're boring me. Nah, I'll leave it, if that's all right with you. No, mate. Finish it. He's a lot like you, your boy. A fucking liability. We're better off without him. I mean, it's not as if he's the only kid we've got running round for us. Tsk, tsk, tsk. How the mighty have fallen, hey? Wild Bill, my arse! It's more like Mild Bill, innit? (LAUGHING) What makes you think I'd listen to you anyway? Like you're somebody. You come in 'ere, throwing your weight about like you're the big "lam", and you're nothing. You're nobody. You are a fucking joke. Telling me what I can and can't do. Fuck that! This is my manor. What? I can't make moves? I can't do a bit of graft without some fucking used-to-be putting up a red light? Does Bertha still live here, Keith? Mate, I'm connected. You remember Glen, don't ya, Bill? He smacked yer arse last time you got out of hand. I think I'll go change a barrel. Your boy's retired, yeah? Mate, he ain't even started. I'm gonna make him my personal project. Be like the dad he never had. Yeah, that's right. Fuck with my family and I'll fuck with yours. What? All kicking off now, is it? Huh! Yeah, right! Look, I ain't come here for no trouble, all right? I'm asking ya just leave me... That's it, drag him out! Come on, you little muppet. - Who's the big knob now, yeah? - Fucking bitch. (SCREAMING) Fuck! He's biting my fucking leg! Get him off me! - Fucker! - You all right, T? Leave him. He's mine. I've just fucking hoovered up there! Ooh, fuck! - Yeah! What? - Fuckin' get him, Dickie! Come on. Is that fucking it? T, T, I'm off, mate. I'm gone. - What? - It's not my cup of tea, mate. I can't do this. See ya later. If... you... go... near... Agh! Fuck! - What you doing here? - Looking for you. Come on. All right. (GROANING) - Does it hurt? - Nah, it's all right. Hurry up, boy! Hey, listen. If it all kicks off, I want you to leg it home as fast as you can. Do you understand me, son? - Yeah, of course, Dad. Course. - Good boy. Bill! - You're officially back, then? - I'm out, I ain't back. Oh! Riddles. I like these. I mean I ain't setting up. No, but you're waging a one-man war against my monkeys, aren't ya? - They was using kids. - So what? Everyone in the borough's going to start thinking they can knock my boys around and I'll be all, like, you know, c'est la vie! Which of course I ain't! - Take it out of what I'm owed. - Which is what precisely'? I done time for you! You, Johnny, Alan, Davey, - and of course Mr. Edgar. - Don't get lippy with me! (LAUGHS) Apple never falls far from the tree, does it, eh? You. You're all out of credit, all right? That's the last I want to hear anything about you having done eight years for anyone, least of all me, or you are gonna end up in this fucking stadium as a fucking permanent fixture. - Clear? - Crystal. Oh, good! Good to see yer again, Glen. And it's good to see you, mate. Let's do lunch sometime. - Yeah. - Yeah. Cunt! Little Bill. - I thought they were gonna kill us. - Yeah, so did I, mate. So did I. - You all right? - Think I've got a splinter. (SIRENS) - What's going on, Dad? - They ain't selling ice creams. Stay still! Stay still! Don't move. You're nicked! - What? Who? Me? - Don't piss about, Bill! Wait! What am I supposed to have done? Oh, be fair. Have a look at yourself! Get in the car! Dean! Right, William Hayward, you're under arrest... Oh, my God! I still don't know what I'm supposed to have done. He was at me nan's. I swear! She's not well. Training him up? Everyone's a grass nowadays, Bill, and you weren't exactly subtle, were yer? Can I have a word with my boy, please? - Be quick. - What happened? Dad battered T, Dickie and the rest of the pub! He's glass, this one, ain't he? Time up. - Look after them for me, Rox. - Course. And behave yourself, you! Ere, hang on. You're coming home, in't ya? Of course I am. Soon as I get out. Yeah, well, you know where we are. Are we done? Right, how old are you? I'm 16. You're gonna need to contact the family liaison officer at Stratford police station. You got that? Oi, mate. You got kids? - Two girls. - It's good, innit? Most of the time. See that blond boy there? That's my son, that is, and the little 'un. They're my boys. I'm their dad.
