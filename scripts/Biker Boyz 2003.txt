Tell Smoke his punk-ass... ...was supposed to be here|30 minutes ago. Instead he out there hiding. Instead of coming|and facing me like a man. Listen, Chu Chu,|he'll be here. No, that's bullshit.|I'm out. He'll be here. I want my money. Listen, if you ask me... ...he's just waiting|to make an entrance. Look out,|little girl. All right, I'll give him|five minutes. No, make it one. Black Knights! Hear ye! Hear ye!|Gather 'round! Black Knights in town. And all you mere mortals|need to bow that ass down! If you have never seen Smoke|do his thing on a motorcycle... ...then you have never seen... ...a brother on a motorcycle|do his thing. Oh, glory be to God... ...y'all, 'cause you know|He had a vision. He put Arthur Ashe on the clay... Jackie Robinson on the diamond... Muhammad Ali in the ring|and my man, Smoke... ...on the two wheels! So don't be s-s-stuttering|and standing your ass around. Get down on your knees|and bow that ass down. Word! He's still gonna lose. Slick Will. Right on, brother. What up, Kid? Hey. Long as I can remember... ...my dad and Smoke|were best friends. As long as anyone can remember,|Smoke was known... ...as "The King of Cali." But if anyone outraced him,|they could win his crown. 203 races. I ain't found nobody with enough|ride to take this from me. Let's make it a lot better.|Two grand. Sound like money|in the bank to me. Cha-ching. The deal was,|a lot of people had dreams... ...of one day winning that crown. You all right? Yeah, I just needed|more acceleration. Yeah, and you would've|fallen on your behind... ...a lot faster. Come on, let's get this. All right, Dad. Here we go.|One, two, three. Go help get Smoke's ride|off the truck, all right? Damn! Damn! Damn. Excuse me. Excuse me. You're sort of in my path. I like the way you put that. Put what? You could've said|I was in your way. But you said I|was in your path. You know, it's like|me and your paths... ...are meant to cross. Feel what I'm saying? No. Anyway, my name is Kid. You want a medal|for that or something? I just want some|conversation, that's all. Just a little conversation. Hmm. Well, there's|only one problem, Kid. What's that, beautiful? I don't converse|with prospects. Excuse me. A prospect. I was at the bottom. I wanted to be recognized|as a true rider. Especially from my dad. Dad. Dad! What? When do I get my colors? What? I'm saying,|this prospect thing... I can't roll|like this no more. That's Smoke's call, boy. Good, man. Good. Damn, Will,|she is tight. The way I saw it,|my concerns were not his. Being Smoke's mechanic,|there was only one rider... ...my dad seemed to care about. Nice work, Will. Hey, thanks, baby. You, too, Kid. Hey, Smoke, listen, man. Burn rubber,|not your soul, baby. Burn rubber, not your soul. I don't see why we stay up|all night fixing his bike... ...while he takin'|all the bows. First of all, "we" didn't|stay up all night, I did. You fell asleep, remember? Second of all, you know,|Smoke always tells me... ...that when he lines|his bike up for a race... ...he doesn't see anything,|he doesn't hear anything. Just a finish line. A cat like that gets in the|zone... That's a gift from God. Sound like bullshit to me. Well, you should wish|you could be half as good. My dad once said the difference|between men and boys... ...is the lessons they learn. Well, my father|taught me plenty. Is that nitrous I smell... ...up underneath that|bike, Chu Chu? What you smell is your ass,|which I'm about to take. No, what I'm smellin'|is victory, brother... 'cause, by the time you get|to second gear to kick it in... I'll be across the finish line... ...and all you gonna smell|is my smoke. And that's when you gonna|wake up and realize... ...the only reason you smoked|so much ass up in Fresno... ...is because I wasn't in it. I bet a G on Smoke. You take Chu Chu. Chu Chu? Aw, hell, no.|Not Chu Chu, man. See, Slick Will is almost|as good a mechanic as me. Almost. You gon' have|to take Chu Chu. You must be crazy. Brothers,|when the green light turns red. Smoke, Chu Chu. All right. Let me tell you something. Bottom line: I don't want|to hear all of this. Somebody ain't got my money. Why it got to be like that? Let's go, baby!|Come on! Go! Go! Yes! Yeah! Oh! Will! Come on, hurry up, man! Will! Will! Hey, get an ambulance! My God! Breathe!|Now, breathe! Don't touch him!|Don't touch him! Don't nobody touch him. ...thank you for the life|of William Alex Crooms. If it's all|right with you... ...we'd like this|buried with him. Everybody has signed it. He'd be proud to have this. Look, Nita, if you need|anything, money, anything... ...come to me first,|I got you. You all right? Just got to get|out of here, man. Jalil, you know I don't want him|playing those violent games. It's not that violent,|is it, Willie? Nope, it ain't|that violent. Okay, that's it. You go to bed... ...brush your teeth... ...and take them little|cruddy shoes with you. Hey, hey. Five more minutes... ...on that phone,|then I want you off. We're going over homework. Oh, I was not born|yesterday, Miss Thing. Five minutes. All right, scrub,|move on over. Oh, yeah, let Mama|give that baby... ...a little spanking,|come on. Okay. Let's see what|you're working with. You're the scrub. Honey, your mama|got skills. Ooh.|That must've hurt. Boy, you still alive? Go on, lay down and die. You're injured? Let me just finish|you off... Here you go. Ooh! Hey! Man! That's all right, baby. I'll give you a rematch. It is all right. Yeah, I know it's okay. I'm gonna go get me|something to eat. Boy, you just ate dinner|an hour ago. Stop tripping. Jalil... ...you be careful. Don't worry about me. I usually only get|gunned down once a night. Cee Cee! Cee Cee! Off the phone now! Donny! Yo, Donny, come on,|I'm calling you out! Donny! Go on. Ten dollars.|Have your cash ready. Donny, come on out! Yo, what's up, Jerome? Kid? Oh, shit, Kid! Yo, dawg!|Put me down, man! Hey, where the hell|you been, brother? Man, ain't nobody|seen you since... Any-anyway, man, it's good|to see you again, dawg! Yeah. I have $500 that says|I'm gonna take your helmet. That's a funny dude. I'm gonna go bust|his fool ass. Now, hold on.|Is Donny here yet? Yeah, he's here. I mean, if you want me to,|I'll tell Donny what's up. Have Donny bust that fool,|feel me? Donny. Yeah. Yo, Kid, don't be such a|stranger, man, come on. Whoo! Looks good. Yeah, you hooked|this one up. It looks real good. You're gonna have|to keep this on here... ...for another day|at least, though. Mm-hmm. Yo, I need you|to hook me up. I got this new girl|who want to get a tattoo, right? Uh-huh. She want to put my name|on her cheek. I take it you don't|mean on her face. Mm-mm. Uh-uh. You know how I do...|I got to brand my women. - Uh-uh.|- Right on their ass. Yo, what's up, Donny? Who the hell are you? Yo, yo, yo... ...that's Slick|Will's son. Okay. Wassup? You too big to|pay respects, Kid? How you doing,|Queenie? I'm a'ight. How you doing? Guess I'm all right. Yo, I thought|you might... ...want to know... Some drunk fool... ...calling you out. That fool? I beat him last week|for 200 bucks. Oh, you know, man,|he talking about 500 ...and your lid. What? You set that up, for real. So what the hell|you doing? Getting ready to race you. Without a lid? You're not just drunk,|you crazy. Just consider it a reminder|in case you glance at me. Reminder of what? That your lid's|about to become mine. Yeah, right! What's happening?|Girl, what's happening now? Whoa, lookit,|the queen has came out. Hey, Queenie,|you up next? Donny! What's happening, T.J.? Got us|a race here, huh? Oh, yeah.|We about to get... ...into this boy ass|right here. Whoa. Where'd you get your bike, boy?|Off eBay? Good luck to you. Hey, how you doing? Yeah! Kick some ass. Keep the wheels down, boys. Hey, doll, wassup?|Wassup, wassup? Kid! I don't know|what the hell... ...your fool ass|was trying to prove... ...but whatever it was,|you proved it. I- I think I just won. Yeah, you did. Fill it up. You get any|of my messages? I've been kind of busy. Talk to you|for a second? I see you got your bike|running kind of right. Oh, you think? Oh, yeah, yeah. Shit. I'm almost impressed, Kid. You could've got hurt|real bad out there, man. I could've got hurt|getting out of the bed. True that, but we|got rules on the set. You can't just roll|up through here... ...with no colors on,|pulling tricks, man. People cutting you|some slack... 'cause of your old man,|I'm tellin' ya. Look, Kid, if you don't want|any problems, a'ight... What? You act like you're|about to do something. Oh, I forgot. I'm supposed to jump|when you say "jump"? I'm not my father,|all right? And what's that|supposed to mean? It means I'm not|kissing your ass... ...the way he did. Before he died... ...he said I should wish|to be as good as you are. Well, he was wrong... 'cause I'm better. Now would be a good time|for you to get on your bike... ...and take your ass home. I can't do that, Smoke. I'm calling your ass out! Figured you'd bitch up. One race... ...and you talking shit? Hmm? You want a piece of me,|Kid? Huh? You want a piece of me? Get you some colors... ...you win you|some legit races... ...and then,|maybe you'll get your shot. When you step to me, Kid,|you better come correct. Hey, Smoke. Why don't you let me|handle this? Some happy boy|comes through... ...messing up one of my events,|we got ways of dealing with him. It's all right, T.J. Kid was just|breaking out, y'all. Ain't that right, Kid? Oh, no doubt. Come on, baby. T.All right. Let's get back to partying. Drinks on the house|for another hour. If you were gonna pull|some shit like that... ...you could've let|a brother know. Hey, man, it just happened. No, no! Racing against|me doesn't... ...just happen... No, man, that's...|I mean... We got paid, man. What can I get you? I'll have a Coke. Anything else? Yeah, I'll take a Coke|myself, sweetheart... ...and a cheeseburger. I'm starving, yo! Wassup, Kid? So, how you been,|Stuntman? Who are you? Oh, my name's Primo. Dawgs, that was some gansta-ass|riding you did tonight, man! Though I wonder|what Donny would think... ...if he knew the white boy|was your friend. We ain't friends. Oh, no? Nah, we just like to|eat at the same place. It's a|coincidence. You know,|that's funny... 'cause I know a little something|about coincidences. Is that so? Yeah. You'll|like this one. Two months ago, some|brother rolls through... Los Vaqueros' annual|dance in Oaktown. It's not unusual|for a black guy... ...to roll through|every now and then... ...but what is unusual... ...is for this black guy|to tell Los Vaqueros... ...that a drunk white|boy wants to race? One who races|with no lid. Man. See, the guy who the white boy|happened to beat was my cousin. That's a|coincidence. Yeah, it is|a coincidence. Look, man, y'all worked|y'all's game in Northern Cali... ...and now you're gonna|squeeze out L.A... ...and I'm saying,|do your thing. I feel that. But I think y'all a little|too close to home, man... ...to be using|that same-ass M.O. Thank you for|the advice, Primer... ...or Primo, whatever. Look, man, if you had|a third guy, for example... ...and ran a totally|different hustle... Oh, oh. ...it'd keep people|off your ass. I mean, shit,|all anyone has to do... ...is figure out where|the annual dance is... ...and there you are. Look, man,|we're not hustling no more. Really? Really. We're going legit. We are? You're going after|Smoke's crown, aren't you? Oh, yeah, that's|what we're doing. C- Can you tell this guy|he's crazy... ...so we can eat|in peace? Yeah, tell me I'm crazy, Kid. Tell me I'm crazy. Look, man... Smoke doesn't have|to chase any more wallets. He's got the crown. He's the King of Cali. Yeah, and... And he told me|to step to him correctly... ...so that's what|I'm doing. I'm stepping|to him correctly. Yeah, but the|only damn way... ...to step to|him correctly... ...is to join one of|the clubs on set. Actually, actually, actually... ...actually...|there's another way. We could start our own club. "We"? "We"? Yeah. Yo, it takes three|to be official... ...and think about|how much money we can make... ...if we joined up together. A lot more than $500|a race, believe me. Well, believe this. We can always find|a third head. That's true, but you're|not gonna find nobody... ...as fast as me, Kid. Come on, baby. Well, maybe|if you can keep up... ...then we have something|we can talk about. Keep up. Hey, oh, nah... Step up or|step off, son. Step up or step off.|Step up or step off. Yo, Stunt, let's show him|how to do it, baby. Oh! Come on, Primo! You got blocks!|Keep up, son! Come on, baby, let's go now! Whoo! Whoo! My name's Primo. You ain't gonna forget|that name. What you think, Kid? He got skills. Way to step|up, son! Ha, ha! Come on. Yeah. Hey, man! - Whoo!|- Ow! Ow. Baby-girl, now you got|to make sure... ...that the, uh, "D"|is nice and straight. Oh! I mean, it's looking|a little crooked right here. Wood? Move. What? I'm saying|you got to... Move! All right.|Look, here. Hurry up. I got to get back|to the shop, you know? I'm still on|the clock. Hey, sweetie,|I told you my sister... ...was a pro, right? Uh-huh. She's gonna take care|of you. Mmm! Mmm. Oh, baby? Hmm? You're gonna put my name|on yours, too, right? What? Well... Uh, yeah, baby-boo. I got you.|You know. It hurts? Yeah. You can take|the pain. You say you|like the look. Wow. What's up, baby? How did you?... What-what in the hell|are you doing here? Came to get me a tattoo. Okay, look, you|can't just stop by. You have to make|an appointment. You see me race|the other day? Yeah. I saw you race. I think you're crazy. Well, I think|some people like crazy. Look, I'm kind of busy,|so, um... Um... ...if you want to make|an appointment... ...here. You can call|my voice mail. Your voice mail? My voice mail. A'ight. Anything else? Yeah, um... I wasn't trying to cause static|at the dance. I was just trying|to show off my bike. Things got out of control,|so, I apologize to you, T.J. I understand that. But, you see,|I ain't the only one... ...you should be apologizing to. I apologize. Word is you've|been kicking it... ...with that white boy|that raced Donny. There a law against that? No. Just wondering|if you met him... ...before the race or after. After. 'Cause we got a strict code|about hustling. You either deal straight up,|or not at all. I'm just as straight up as you. So, you're taking... ...college classes|and fixing bikes part-time? That's right. Following in your|father's footsteps? In some things. All right, if we agree|to vote you in... ...your club will|be recognized. But if you're|not voted in... ...you can come again|before us in a year. I understand that. Good for you. All those in favor of Kid's club|being recognized... ...acknowledge. So what y'all going|to call yourself? You okay? Yeah, I'm good. Okay. 'Cause, um... I just thought... ...it might hurt a little. No. It's all good. It kind of helps|if you breathe a little bit. Just... Breathe. You know, Tina... I'm really feeling you. Feeling me? Yeah. You know, I mean,|I like you a lot. Kid, how would you know that? You hardly even know me. I just know. That's all, you know? So, what does this mean? Oh... Uh... It's something my dad,|uh... Used to say. It means, uh, whatever,|whoever steps to you... ...just remember who you are. You know... Keep it real. I know about|what happened to him. I'm sorry. Can't imagine how|you're dealing with it. Life's jacked up. You know, just, uh... ...learn how to deal|with it, you know? I guess so. Yeah. Oh... I forgot to thank you|for my flowers. Thank you. You know, I never flowed|like that before. Never... You know,|bought flowers... ...for a girl. Yeah, I could tell. Yeah? Um... Picked them out myself. I can tell that, too. Come here. Come here. Think of|the sexiest girl... Think of|the sexiest girl... ...you ever seen|in your life... ...the sexiest...|and I'm telling you... Shorty was sexier|than that. And she was checking you out? No, she was drooling|all over me, son. So, you know, I start|talking to Shorty, right? She telling me|she been racing... ...for, like, two years... ...and she want to race me|for 500 beans. Now, that sound|like easy money. Yo, as fine as she is... I'm thinking|the same thing. Only she ain't|got no money. So, she says if I win,|I get whatever I want. Whoa. So, did you win? What you think? So, I takes her back|to the motel... ...to settle our debt, right? And Shorty starts|kissing on me... You know what|I'm saying? Starts twirling|her tongue in my ear... ...and I'm saying, son,|that's my spot. Don't twirl the tongue|in my ear. No, that's a little more|than I need to know. Hold up; you took her|back to the motel... ...and you only got|a ear job? Hee-hee-hee, shut up. That ain't funny. Anyway, so before I could|tell Shorty to chill... ...she got me handcuffed|to the headboard like... Blah! - Oh...|- Nice. Next thing I know, five|of her friends come storming in. - Oh...|- Nice. No, see,|you're not hearing me, man. It's not coming|through your head. This ain't no|S & M bruise. They beat the shit out of me... ...stole my money,|stole my clothes... ...and I had to ride home|butt-naked, yo. And there was like this|big-ass traffic jam... 'cause everybody|got out they car... ...to laugh at me. I nearly burned my nuts off|on the way home. Yo, man... Yo, we a motorcycle club, right? We supposed to stick together|at times like this, right? You're just going to|laugh at me like that? Huh? At least help me|get my money back, man. That's messed up, man. That's mad messed up. On behalf of all|the club presidents... ...we want to thank you|for coming out. This is our fourth annual|Bikini Bike Wash. And every dime... ...raised here today|goes towards purchasing... ...schoolbooks for kids|in our community. So, if you got a dirty bike... ...this is where you want to be. And if you got a clean bike,|this is where you want to be. Now, please, give a warm welcome... ...to our motorcycle|sanitation engineers! Come on. Damn. Come on. Come on. Hang on, hang on, hang on! Before all you sisters|get too salty... ...please say hello to Turbo. Oh...! No, no, no, no! What? Yo, man, that's what|I'm talking about. Do they come any tighter,|them shorts he got on? I ain't feeling that|right there. All they need|is the Train, baby! All you need is the|chug-a-chug-a-chug-a-chug-a... Soul Train! I think, um, you|need to cool off. Hey, you... I see you. If there's one bike out here... ...that doesn't need|to be cleaned, it's yours. Well, it's for charity. Ah... Charity. Speaking of charity,|where's, um... ...uh... Donny? I really wouldn't know. Well, ain't|y'all involved? Brothers and commitment. You know about that one,|don't you? That again. Mmm. I suppose|it didn't help matters... ...that I beat him in a race. You could've let him win. Like I let you win? Like you let me win? Don't let me keep you, huh? Wouldn't want you|to feel "smothered." I'm up next. Hey, yo, Kid! These guys want|to talk to you. Hey, Kid, I'm Philly. What's up, man? - And I'm Flip.|- What's going on? Yo, we saw you race|Donny a while back. Yo, we saw you beat|Big Gee a week ago. Your flow was|off the chain. Off the heezy. Yo, now that you got|your own crew and all... ...we was hoping to join up. What? I mean, we know|that we got to be... ...prospects for a while... ...but whatever it takes to become|Biker Boyz, we'll do it. - Whatever it takes?|- No doubt. Don't jump, Smoke. It can't be that bad. Well, if it ain't Dogg... "man's best friend." Hey! Hey! Fetch! Why don't you hang it up? You haven't raced|anybody credible... ...since the accident. Oh, that's 'cause|you think... ...you're the only one|who's credible. Think? Only reason you beat me|up in Fresno... ...is 'cause my piston|got jacked up. That shit|ain't happening again. Good. You need to get in|line and wait your turn... ...like everybody else. Ain't nobody else... ...except you. I been watching you...|riding safe, careful... ...not taking any chances. You ain't got the heart|to be King of Cali. Not no more. I can see that|in your eyes. You sure that's|what you see? Look again. I'll tell you what|you see, you mutt. You see somebody who's|got everything you want. Somebody who's|got three Gs... ...that says you ain't got|the heart to take it. Three Gs? How about five? How about five? Five, baby. Wait up! You see that?|You see that? Go! Come on! Yeah! Baby, that's what|I'm talking about. Ooh! Ooh! That's right.|Give it up. Get your little ass|on over there, homeboy. Where there's smoke,|there's fire! - Fire!|- Fire! Always a bridesmaid,|never a bride. Say something for the people|at home, baby. Get out of my face|with that camera! Yo, Dogg, now that's|what I call a race. Couldn't get no closer. Yo, baby, say something|for the folks at home, man. Let them know|what's going on, Dogg. Just a little something|for them, baby. Damn, Kamera Man. You next, fool. You next. You got smoked, baby. Don't even sweat that, man. Don't even sweat it. Soul Train? Yes, sir? How much does that doggy|in the window owe me? His life, Smoke. He owe you his life. That's a good Dogg. Hey, ain't you|forgetting something? Come on, boy. Come on, you|can do it, boy. Come on, boy. Here, boy! Here, boy! Come on. That's a good Dogg. That's a good Dogg. Come on! Why don't you fetch that? Bad Dogg. That ain't no dog, Smoke. That's a bitch. That's a doggone shame. We gonna tell you|a little story here. You want to hear that? Tell you a little story|about a boy named Dogg. Quarter mile race,|need to be up on a hog. Then one day|he came against the Smoke. Got to the line|and all he did was choke. Smoked, that is. Black Knight! That's right. Keep going. I thought you were|supposed to race before me. We were. I guess you're|not the only one... ...who likes to make|an entrance. T.J. Let's ride. Can't do it. Can't hold the bridge|any longer. What? Maybe next time you'll|leave out the halftime show. Maybe next time|you'll take some notes. We racing? 23.976 Or you making upan excuse? Say again? Are we racing... ...or you just|blowing smoke? Let's race. Black Knights... ...let's roll. Our boy's going|to wreck you, man! He's going to wreck you! It's all about|the Soul Brothers! The Soul Brothers|look like "ole" brothers. Have your boy call it... Kid, you're wasting time! Come on, baby, do your thing!|Come on, baby! Yeah! All right, thanks, Elroy. Okay. The bail's|been taken care of. At some point, he's|going to have to appear... ...in front of a judge. Now, if you want,|I can pull a few strings. Get him off with a fine,|maybe community service. You're not used to me|sounding like a lawyer, huh? I just never thought|my son would need one. Damn! Oh... I have been in denial,|Soul Train. Well, that is one way|of putting it. Thanks for understanding. Look, Anita, uh... ...the night Slick Will died... ...everybody was running around|and... Screaming and... ...but I swear to God... ...he didn't even blink|when that bike came at him. And Kid is just as fearless... ...so if he does go down... ...you should know it's not going|to be on anybody's sideline. How long you been racing? About six months. Ma, I'm real good. Damn it, Jalil! I'm real good. I don't care how good|you think you are! Do you know what we|call bikers in the ER? Organ donors! You hit that pavement|at 120 miles an hour, baby... ...and it is over. I'm not going down. There's only two|kind of riders... ...those that been down, and|those that gonna go down. There must be three kind,|them and me... 'cause, you know,|I'm... I'm good. Jalil... What? I lost your father|like this. Dad wasn't even racing. He was playing it|"better safe than sorry." And if you play it safe,|you sorry. What did?... Boy, let me tell you something. I have lived too long, and|I have been through too much... ...to go through this again. Now I am not|gonna sit here... ...and watch you go|down like this... ...not while you living|under my roof... ...so you tell me right now... ...are you going|to keep racing? 'Cause, if so, I will pack|your bags my damn self. And you can go stay|with your friends. Ma, why you tripping? Are you gonna race, Jalil? No. Out. What? Get out the goddamn car! I don't want you back in|that car if you lyin' to me. Now, you tell me, are you going|to keep racing: Yes or no? Mom, come on. I li... No! You promise? I said no. You got what you wanted. I promise. Are we through? Are we through? Yeah, we're through. Well, maybe|if she can't understand... ...where you're coming from,|maybe you should try... ...to understand|where she's coming from. I thought you had my back. I do.|I'm just saying. Baby, maybe she's just afraid|of losing you. Why you so concerned|about what happens... ...between me and my mother? I'm just trying to make|sure you're a'ight. Okay, punk? Punk? Mm-hmm. Punk. What you gonna do, hmm? You know this punk|loves you, right? What? I'm saying...|I got mad love for you. I think|it's pretty obvious... ...how you feel about|a brother so, uh... Okay, I'm-I'm|really not ready... ...to have this|conversation. I ain't ready to have|the conversation, either. I'm just saying that I know,|and I love you. The Black Knights'|annual dance is tonight. I thought you'd|been gone by now. Got to get a date first. Her name is Tina... ...and Jalil|is a-whupped. Cee Cee, I don't want|you talking like that. Yeah, shut up, girl. Eh, Jalil. Anyway... ...you know, Dad used to take you|to the dance all the time... ...right? Might as well keep... ...the tradition alive. Can't remember|the last time I saw you out. What are you|talking about, boy? I'm saying Tina's not my date. You are. You should go, Mom. Yeah, Mom... ...you should go. Yeah, you should go. Riding high, ain't|you, youngster. Even heard you're thinking|about going up to Fresno. Yeah, I'm thinking about it. Yeah, I seen|a few of your races. You a'ight. I heard about the race|between Dogg and Smoke... ...and you Strayz|got your ass whipped. Young boy got his chest|all pumped up. Who have you raced that's|even worth talking about, man? Motherland. Did he say Motherland? Yo! My grandmama|can beat that fool. I beat her, too. Oh, you're a comedian, huh? Look here... ...the only reason I ain't put|my foot in your ass yet... ...is 'cause of Baby-girl... But I'm going to give you|some act-right, youngster. Believe that. Hmm. Look here, man... I'm here 'cause|I'm calling you out. On behalf of who?|Dogg? On behalf of the Strayz. You talk like a man. Let's see if you can|ride like one. Next time, Stray. Dang, Baby-girl, you sure|know how to pick 'em. Kid, only person|ever beat Dogg is Smoke. You knock Dogg out the box,|and Smoke can't dodge you. Look, man, I promised|my mother I lay low... ...so that's what I'm doing,|so just chill. This puts you one step away. Y'all Biker Bitches going|to keep on whispering... ...or you going to step up|like a man, Kid? I got Dogg outside|waiting for you. Look, man, if you ain't going|to race for no paper... ...damn, at least do it|for some self-respect. Oh, I forgot. You're just like|your bitch-ass daddy. - J, come on...|- You know my daddy? Calm down now. Hey, thanks. Move, move, move! Excuse me. What? Walk! Who the hell are you,|coming up in here... Slow your roll, girl.|Slow your roll. You don't want no|problems with this lady. I'll be right|with you, a'ight? I'll be right|with you. Still on the prowl. I thought by now|you'd grown up. Nice to see you, too, Anita. Let's go out back to talk. I need to talk to you|now, Smoke. I think Jalil's|going to race... ...some crazy-looking brother|in a Strayz jacket. Oh, you're talking about Wood. No, if he was racing,|he'd be racing against Dogg. - I need you to stop it.|- Why? I've already lost one of|my own to this bullshit. I'm not looking|to lose my baby. Well, I'm not the one|you need to be talkin' to. Well, I am talking to you. He don't listen to me, Anita. He ain't paid attention to|a word I said since Will died. Now, what makes you think|he's going to pay... ...two shits of attention|to what I got to say now? You told me if I ever needed|anything, you got me. Oh, you did say|that, didn't you? Yeah, yeah.|Come on, Anita! I'm asking you to stop it. What am I supposed to do?|You know how the set go. What, I'm supposed|to just jump up... ...and say, "Hey, hey, hey.|No, y'all can't do this"? The man has laid down|a challenge. It's been accepted. I can't stop that. That ain't how we do this. I ain't asking|how you do it. I'm telling you|what you gonna do. Why the hell would I do that? Because he's your son. What you say? What you say? Jalil is your son, Smoke. Oh, no. Oh, no. Yes, Smoke! He's your son. And if you didn't have your head|so far up your ass... ...you'd know this. You serious? Yes, I'm serious. He was born eight months|after I got with Will. Who was I with|before then? Who did I have|to cut loose... ...because he changed his women... ...as much as he changed|his drawers? Almost 19 years... ...and you never looked at him. I looked at him. Damn! Damn, you're dropping this|on me now... ...and I'm the one|that's got my head up my ass? Okay, all right, that's fair. Maybe I should've|told you before. And maybe I shouldn't|be telling you at all. But now you know. Did Will know? He never asked. But he wasn't stupid. He had eyes. He knows it takes nine months|to make a baby. Well, if I was deaf,|dumb and blind... ...it wouldn't justify this. You should've told me, Anita. Smoke, I tried. Not hard enough. Well, it's kind of hard|talking to somebody... ...when they in bed|with another woman. Okay, look, this has|nothing to do with me. All right, but...|I'm just asking. Do right by Kid. This is bullshit, Anita. Are you going|to do it, or not? Kid! Dogg! Let's do it. It's only trackin'|in this, right now. Puttin' us on the map, baby! Beat him up!|Beat him up! Yeah! Yo, what's up, Dogg? That's a nice lid, man. Like that? Hell, yeah. It's a shame|you won't be able... ...to take that|home with you. Kid, Kid. I don't know whether|I should waste my time... ...whipping your ass|in this race... ...or take you across my knee. Kid! Come here. For what? We need to talk. Man, I'm about to race! I said get your ass|over here now! What? Get off the bike.|Get over here now! Aw... What's the matter? Smokey won't let you come out... ...and play with the bandit|tonight? I'm tired of you, Smoke! This ain't your race, man! We tryin' to do|something out here! What's your problem, Smoke? Kid... ...what are you doing, man? What does it look|like I'm doing? I'm setting to ride, man. Not tonight, kid.|You ain't racing tonight. Man, you buggin', man. Listen to me for|a second, all right? Listen to me. Now, I was with the Black|Knights for five years... ...before I had my first race. It takes that long to|develop the skill, all right? It's not the engine.|It's not the bike. It's the rider, his reflexes.|I know you good. You real good, but... You don't have the experience|to go up against Dogg. Man, shut up, have a seat! - Man, I'm about to...|- Kid... Watch me race. Not tonight. That boy better learn|how to duck or something! Smoke, what you doing, man? Primo, back off. Train. Train! Yo. Seen Nita? She caught a ride. When? Couple minutes ago. Hey... You all right? Yeah, yeah,|I'm all right. This is supposed|to be fun, Prez. Stay out of it!|He jumped him from behind! You stay out of it! You... Stay|out of it! Hey, hey! You just make sure|you stay out of it! Get up!|Kick his ass! Go on, Prez!|Go on, Prez! Kick his ass, Kid! Easy, big man!|Easy! Come on. Hit him.|Come on. Come on! I told you that boy|needed some act-right. You all right? Get up, Kid. Who else knew about this? Train is the only person|I ever confided in. What about Smoke? I told him tonight. Come here, baby. What are you doing? You talkin' about "give me|your word" for racing? You been lyin' to me|my whole life! Jalil, baby, let's just|sit down and talk about... About what? Jalil... Jalil! What you want, Queenie? I figured you wouldn't|want to be alone tonight. What made you think|I would be? Like I couldn't kick|the ass of the skank... ...you've been hanging|out with lately. You want me to go,|I'll go. We gonna win more lids... ...than any crew on the set. And we gonna out-hustle... ...every crew off the set. Kid... ...now, you know|we can't be legit... ...if we go back to hustling,|all right? Set won't let us. And another thing. From now on, Biker Boyz|set their own rules! We doin' wheelies,|they can't even name it. We're doing stoppies, yo,|they can't even frame it. Biker Boyz! Yeah! I said Biker Boyz! Yeah! - A'ight?|- A'ight! Biker Boyz! Rain check. Fresno. What comes with it? - You see that?|- Oh, my God! Are you bulletproof,|Biker Boy? Hey, Max! You want to slow your roll? Hey, Smoke, my man. It's been a while. Long time. I need you|to cut him loose, Max. Is that so? Yeah. Well, you know|what, Smoke? I'm afraid|I can't do that. Why not? Well, because this asshole|and his knucklehead friends... ...they came down to my turf... ...and they hustled my nephew|out of how much? 1,200 bucks. 1,200 bucks. Can we make it right? Go back inside. That's not an option. I want double the money back. Done. And I want you to make sure... ...that that asshole... ...learns his lesson. Oh, I'll take care|of that, all right. You know I|could have you... ...thrown off|the set, right? Do what you gotta do. So, how you wanna|handle things... ...between me|and you then? I'm 18 years old. We ain't got shit|to handle. You do your thing,|I'll do mine. Yeah, a'ight,|but I need you... ...to hear me on|something, a'ight? What? Your mother's right|to be worried about you. The way you rolling,|you ain't gonna see 19. Now you need to slow|your ass down. You need to stop telling me|what to do! My dad died trying to follow... ...your ass around! Damn, Kid, why can't we just?... Why can't we just talk? You know, like... Like what?|Father and son? No, like friends. We ain't friends. All right, father and son, then. We ain't that either. Jalil, I'm your father. Fuck you, Smoke! So, it's like that, huh? It's like that. Let me ask you something,|man to man. You still think|you got enough heart to race me? Shit, I got enough heart|to prove... ...you ain't half the man|you think you are. Well, why don't we do that then? One thing. If I win... ...you quit. No hustling, no racing,|no bullshit. Now, why would I stop racing? You seen what I can do. Don't mean shit|without the crown. I am the King of Cali, baby. Me, Smoke. These are my terms. I win, you quit. You want the ride,|or you scared? I want the ride. Good. But I don't want|to do it here. Let's do it in|front of everybody. I'm saying Fresno. You want to try|to put me... ...back on the straight|and narrow? Fine. You win, I quit. But if I win... You quit. Now... You want that ride? Or are you scared? Um, Kid? What? It's, um, company. Um... I'm gonna...|I'm gonna go... To the store...|and I'll be back. What's up? Hey. I'll get some clothes on. I'm, uh, sorry to drop|in on you like this. Oh, that's cool. Um, I-I brought|some things... ...that I thought you might need. Hey, I've been... ...promising you|that rematch... ...so, if you want|to practice up, it's on. A rematch. I've been meaning|to give you something, too. Hold on. No, Jalil. Mom, please. Just because|I'm not living there... ...doesn't mean I shouldn't|help you out. I was raised better|than that. No, baby. You keep it. - Mom...|- You keep it. So... How you|doing, baby? I mean...|are you okay? I'm good. The word is, um,|you're going to Fresno. I am. You be careful. Hey, Mom. Um... I want to know,|you know... ...if Dad was still alive,|would you... ...would you have told me? I don't know. Would you have|wanted me to? I don't know. Got nothing but|fire here, baby. Nothing but fire. Doesn't matter|if he shows up... ...with the space shuttle|today. Smoke ain't gonna save|his ass today, I tell you that. - Not today, brother.|- No. Not today. Hey, Kid. Did you see that? Oh, man, come on!|Get out the way! Come on! Hey, hey, hey. Kid!|Come on! Yo! Yo, come on! Damn. Is he a'ight? Be quiet. Well, baby, I'm just|trying to see... Just be quiet! Kid... Kid, you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Hold still, man. Hey, Kid, hold still. Hold still, now. - I'm fine, man.|- Now wait for... The paramedics. You okay, sir? I'm good. - Sir, are you okay?|- I said I-I'm okay! Let 'em check you out, Kid. Let 'em check you out. Back up, man. He's up and|he looks good. He looks good, man. Walk it off, yo. Come on! And he pulled it out! That's my boy right there. Thanks for seeing|that I was all right. No problem. About your ride... It'll be ready. By tomorrow? I don't think so. Don't worry about me. Just make sure you show up. Oh, yeah,|I'll be there. Cops are shutting|the track down. Too many people got hurt|out here. But we found this|greedy-ass farmer... ...who's gonna let us use|his property. I'll get you directions. Noon? Noon. Now, just so you know, Kid... ...when Slick Will|worked on my bike... ...and said I should race, I raced. When he worked on my ride... ...and said I should lay low,|I did so. He didn't|follow me around. I followed him. Did you see the way|he laid the bike down... ...and got up and walked away? You see that? Mm-hmm. Damn, that boy got steel,|I'm telling you. You scared? Oh, don't get it twisted now. I will be whipping that ass. Mm-hmm. Oh, yes. Shit. You know, I had this dream|a couple of nights ago. Will was still alive, right? He asked me if...|he could race Kid instead of me... ...so I said yeah. They got on their bikes|and started racing. Yeah? Who won? Well, that's the weird thing...|Will won. Really? Yeah. Been... Racking my brain... ...trying to figure out|what it means, you know? Yeah? What'd you come up with? Uh... I think it means that... I mean, even as pissed off|as I was with Anita... ...for waiting so damn long|to tell me... I wouldn't have been half the|father to Kid that Will was. I mean... I mean,|I know that's true. But if you ask me... ...he needs a father now... ...just as much as|he did before. Make him grow up. Yeah. Give it a go. Shit! God! You all right? You all right?|You okay? Yo, Dogg, it's all bad. I can't even|fix this. Not by tomorrow. I've been wanting Smoke's crown|ever since I was on the set. Had my chances. But you... My fault you went down today. My fault if your ride|ain't ready. Only two bikes|I've seen out here... ...as powerful as Smoke's... ...yours... ...and mine. You think you're|up to it... I'll lend it to you. Just promise me you'll bring|his punk-ass down. Baby, are you gonna|come to sleep? Yeah, in a minute. You were right all along. About what? I do love you. I told you that. The road on the other|side of the hill... ...and Kid wants Tina|to call the start. I'll see. Smoke wants this man-to-man. No nitrous, no bullshit. I'll see. He says he wants|his girl, Tina... ...to start the race. He wants it straight up,|man-to-man. No nitrous, no bullshit... ...no tricks. You know, somebody asked me|the other day. That's right, baby,|what they ask you? They said, "Soul Train." Soul Train. "Why them Biker Boyz|wear yellow?" I said, "'Cause they scared!" They said, "Soul Train,|why do Biker Boyz wear black?" I said, "Because|they want to be Knights!" Knights. Knights! Wassup? You gonna bow down today, son. No, Biker Boyz don't bow down. We rise up and above! We rise up|and above! Yo, Soul Train... Yep. Yeah. Soon, he will be smoked! And we will set fire|to that ass! Biker Boyz don't bow down! My dad died trying|to follow your ass around. I thought by now|you'd grown up. You ain't got the heart|to be King of Cali. He said I should wish|to be as good as you are. He needs a father now,|just as much as he did before. Jalil is your son, Smoke. Make him grow up. Whew. You know what this means? I'm the King of Cali. True dat. Represent, Kid... ...whatever that means to you. And so you know... Will was always proud|of you, man. Said so all the time. I'm proud of you, too. Hey, Smoke. Yeah? You know, you're my dad. We can't change that,|even if we wanted to. No. But I'm going to represent. Straight up. No hustling. No bullshit. But, uh... I want you to hold|onto this for me. Keep it, man.|You've won it. It's yours. So, one day, I'll come by|and get it from you... ...if that's okay. All right... All right. Burn rubber. Not your soul. Not your soul. The difference|between men and boys... ...is the lessons they learn. My father taught me plenty.
