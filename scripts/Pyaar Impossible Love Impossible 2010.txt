And as it often happens in love, a time comes when the boy and girl meet for the very first time. Tonight was that night. l was so good at it. Oh, get off me, Natasha. They say boys will never understand what goes through a girl's mind.. Stop it! Don't be such a party pooper! l guess this was something like that. You know you want me to do it! No! No! - OK, you know you want me to do it! Stop! Stop being a mummy! Alisha! Stop this! Oh God! lt sucks! Uh oh.. lt's very late. Let's go Alisha, c'mon. OK, OK.. do not panic, OK.. l can do this. Alisha! Oh my God.. Alisha come down.. Alisha, you're making me nervous, just come down! Babe.. it's just freaking tequila we've done this a hundred times before! Alisha! Come down! OK, OK, watch, OK watch.. l can do this on my toes! - Alisha.. l can do this on my toes! Alisha come down! Alisha! Alisha! Oh my God! Alisha! Alisha! Alisha! Alisha! She cannot swim.. Alisha! Help, someone help! Looks like l'll have to give her mouth to mouth.. ls she OK? Thank you so much! But we'll take it from here, OK?.. thank you. Hey, what went wrong? This was not how it was supposed to be, by now she should've fallen in love with me. l mean, l saved her life, right? l can't understand it. Ya! l know when! Tomorrow morning.. of course.. l'm so stupid, right! ln matters of the heart l'm sort of new. Enough is enough l'm fed up Alisha! l don't care what stage your semester is in. l'm taking you away from here and that's final. Dad! My entire life is here. How can you even suggest that? l don't care! This is the fifth time l've been called here. l can't take it any more. l am not going anywhere! l'm not asking you. l'm telling you, understand? So what will you do? Take me from here forcefully? l wanna see you try! - l'm taking you away right now! l've spoken to the Dean and as of today you've been rusticated.. .. from this university, understand? That is so unfair. Pack your bags. Dad, please.. my semester! l'm waiting outside. - Dad, please! Look, thanks for whatever you did last night. But l think you should go now. She needs to be alone. Thanks anyway. Don't worry. l'll speak to your dad. Everything's gonna be alright. He's not gonna listen. What makes you think he's gonna listen to you.. he's just stubborn.. who were you speaking to? Nobody.. just that geek who saved your life last night. l should say thank you, right? Ya.. but that's not important right now. l guess.. The truth is that not every love story can have a happy ending, right? And when something like this happens then people like.. .. us need to forget about our love and move on. She still doesn't even know who l am.. and it's OK. Now, l just need to get her out of my heart.. that's all. Alisha, l guess this love was impossible after all. But l wish you happiness wherever you go. Goodbye, Alisha. Good morning, Abhay Sharma! This is your wake up call for the day. l have the following facts for you this morning. Did you know that the white part of your fingernail is called the lunula? Did you know that when a coffee seed is planted it takes five years to yield consumable fruit? Did you know that the largest prime number is 1 3, 395 digits long more than the number of.. Morning. Morning, Dad. Dad, l have a very important meeting today. Meeting? What meeting? There's an investor who is interested in my software. l'm giving him a presentation today. That's great! But you should have come to me first. l have lots of friends in the software industry. l could have set up a meeting with any one of them for you. Dad, you started your business alone. You did everything solely on your own. l want to follow in your footsteps. Like father, like son. But if you ever need anything you know that l'm here, right? Of course, Dad. Now eat your cereal. l'm worried about you, friend! No, l'm really worried! You've been in love with that girl for six years.. What was her name? - Alisha. Alisha. lt's been six years! Not six, Dad, it's been seven years. Of course! Seven years. Look son.. There's love and then there's obsession. You need to forget about this girl. Anyway, l have to go. And good luck for your interview! Abhay? - Ya. Hi! Hi! Siddharth Singh. You can call me Sidhu. OK. Some coffee? Ya? - Ya. Excuse me, two cappuccinos please! So, finally we meet. - Ya. l've heard a lot about your software. l.. l hope you like it. l'm sure l will. So shall we begin? OK, let's start. So this software is essentially an operating system that l've named Unity. Now, you'll be thinking, why Unity? Well, Unity because this operating system has the ability to unify each.. .. and every kind of operating system across the world. l mean, you can use programs running on any operating system on Unity. lt could be Windows, the Mac OS or even Linux systems. Moreover, you can even use it on your mobile phone. So, from mobile phones to computers, it works on everything. So this is Unity, my work over the last seven years. Fantastic! Abhay, l'm impressed. Thanks. l'm very impressed. ln fact, this has exceeded my expectations. Just one thing Abhay. - Ya? Before investing in this, l'll need the original program files of this software. Program files? OK.. Yes, l'll need them. Can you just excuse me, please? Hello, Dad? Hi, Abhay, how are you? How are things? Dad, he's quite impressed but he's asking for the original program files. He's saying that he wants them before he invests in the software. No, no, no. Don't give him anything until the deal is finalised. Tell him that after the deal is done you will give the files to him, OK? Nothing before that. Don't make that mistake. OK? OK, OK, Dad. Thanks. Bye. Should we go ahead? Uh, actually Sidhu, sir.. l won't be able to give you the actual program files until the deal is done. But l have a CD that contains the executable files. You can learn everything about the software through it. This you can take. Look, Abhay. Don't get me wrong. Your Unity software is fantastic. But on giving it some thought l feel that this is not what we're looking for right now. But.. but l assure you, sir! This is a path breaking software. No, it's fantastic but just not right for us right now. But all the best and thank you very much. Sir, it's taken me seven years to develop this software.. .. and l've personally tested it in every possible hardware configuration. So if you're thinking compatibility, it's compatible with all the hardware systems. lf you're thinking speed, l've tested it in all the benchmark tests.. .. and if you're thinking usability then this is so easy that even a child can use it. So, as you can see, this is going to be a revolutionary new software called Unity. What's the name of the company? - Pinnacle. very good presentation, Mr. Sharma. very good. But we've heard that there is a Singapore-based company.. .. that is going to launch a similar software, and it's called.. Unify? Unify? But, but sir, l developed this software, it's absolutely original. lt's not possible that someone could develop.. a software exactly like this one, it's just not possible, sir. l hear what you're saying, Mr. Sharma. But our company wouldn't want to get involved in anything that harms our reputation. l hope you understand. Anyway, thank you very much, Mr. Sharma, l wish you all the best. Excuse me, could you tell me the name of that Singapore company.. ? Ya, sure.. Pinnacle Software. .. Pinnacle Software. Can you just excuse me please? - Sure. So, what you're saying is that you have made this software. Dad, l've been working on this for the last seven years. OK, and now someone has stolen it from you? Ya. You know, Abhay, l'm to blame for making you like this. Like what? Like me. Running away from unpleasantness, not fighting for your rights, but there's a reason behind this. After your mother passed away l just wanted to protect you from the rest of the world, and in the process l made you weak. That's not true. That's true. Now if you want to forget about this software.. .. and stay here with me, l'll still love you as much as l do right now. l'll still be proud of you. But if you go to Singapore and get your software back from that man then you will be proud of yourself. lt's your decision, what do you want to do? You know,.. ,l have the best dad in the world. l know that. And l'm going to Singapore. Taxi! l'm sorry sir, but there's no one with the name Siddharth Singh.. .. working in any department of this company. Dad, l'm sitting outside the Pinnacle office. There's no one named Siddharth Singh here. l'm at a loss, Dad. What should l do? Son, don't lose hope and remember one thing - that you have.. .. to get your software back no matter what, OK? Believe in yourself, everything will be alright. And what if l don't find him? l don't think he's here at all. l don't know what to do. lf this company releases my software then what can l do about it, Dad? Please help me, l don't know what to do, l just.. just don't know what to do any more. Relax, relax Abhay.. just relax. OK, do one thing. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. Now imagine good things around you. lmagine that there are new, beautiful computers around you. And Alisha.. Of course, of course, Alisha.. her too, ya? Feeling good, right son? Ya, Dad. Now open your eyes. Feeling good? l feel great, Dad, just great. l can see her, like.. like she's right in front of me. She's just so beautiful. Who? Alisha, Dad! Who else? Son, l told you to open your eyes! Dad, my eyes are open but she's still in front of me! OK, fine, no problem. Actually, this is even better, You keep dreaming about her! So what is Alisha doing right now? Dad, she's gone inside the Pinnacle office. That's a good thing! lt's a good sign. So, why don't you follow her into the office And fight for what's rightfully yours? Get your software back, it's not me but Alisha who is showing you the path. You're right Dad, l'm going. OK, good. l'm going too, to the bathroom! Look, l'm not going to take no for an answer. l need to see someone right now. But - No ifs or buts! l want to see someone, now! OK, OK, sir, just calm down. Let me see what l can do. Hi! There's someone who wants to meet the head of PR urgently. ls that alright? OK, thank you. Sir, you can go to the fourth floor.. ..and meet our public relations officer in charge. lt's the first room on the left. OK, thank you. - You're welcome. Sorry. lt's alright. C'mon now. You guys can't even do this much? l have to do everything myself? Oh, my God! Even l was remembering God, Dad! Look, you've been in love with this girl for the last six years.. Seven years, Dad. OK, don't correct me. Seven years? OK, fine. Don't you think you should speak to her now at least? What's the worst that could happen? She won't recognise you, or she might give you a slap or two! But at least you'll have a clear picture about your situation. You're absolutely right, Dad. Basically, you're not going to speak to this girl.. No, Dad. Congratulations! Thank you. Taxi! Taxi! Thank you. Tania, stop troubling me! Tania, l can't deal with this, are you mad? Tania! Tania! Stop it, Tania, have you lost your mind? Tania, behave yourself, l'm not going to deal with your nonsense, Tania, l swear! Just stop it, Tania! You're driving me mad.. ..Tania, l can't deal with your nonsense any more! Thank God! You're here. Look, l can't do this any more, she's not a child, she's a monster! Forgive me, but l'm leaving. l quit! No, no, no, no Mansi, you can't go anywhere. Look, please, l need to get back to office and there's no one here to look after Tania. Please, please. OK, just try and understand, l'm a single, divorced working mother and l don't have anyone else! - l don't care! OK, OK, fine, l'll pay you double, double! l don't care! - Triple! But not more than that. l'm sorry Alisha, but l love my own life more than money. Now you handle this monster of yours, l'm out of here.. bye! Mons.. ! Tania Merchant! Mom! You're home, yay! Oh no you don't, don't try cute on me. lt's not gonna work. l'm very upset with you. How will l go back to the office now? So don't go to the office, Mom. We'll spend the entire day together. Why do you trouble me so much, T? Cause l love you, Mom! l love you too, munchkin, but you know Mom is working. And however much l want to, l can't spend the entire day with you. Now, we'll have to find somebody to look after you. Who? Hello.. Jasmeet and Jasmeet Nanny Agency.. an exclusive agency of lndian Nannies. Our Nannies are extremely intelligent.. Jasmeet! This is Alisha.. Alisha Merchant. Alisha! Alisha! You talk to her. Not me! Not me! l won't speak to her. - Again.. Oh no!.. speaker. Ya, hello Alisha dear. So, tell me, how can l be of assistance to you? Jasmeet, you know what? That nanny you sent me had so much attitude! l've fired her, and now my problem is that l need to get back to the office. And l urgently need another nanny. Again? You know how it is.. l know how it is, Alisha. l know how it is. Actually, the thing is, that this is the fifth nanny that has quit working at your house in the last three months. l don't think anyone will be willing to work at your place. And don't feel bad. You see, your daughter, Tania, she's a bit of a challenge, you see. l don't think anyone will come to work for you because everyone is scared of her. C'mon, Jasmeet, she's just six! So what's the big deal? OK, fine, fine. Please help me out this time, l need to get back to the office and l'm really, really late. Just this one time. Hello, look this is very short notice. lf someone can come then she'll come to work for you. But l'm not making any promises. And if she does come then she'll reach your place by twelve o' clock. That's fine. l'll wait for her, OK. But this is the last time we are doing this, we can't send any more nannies after this time. l owe you one, Jasmeet! OK, Alisha dear, take care then, thank you. Again.. Jasmeet, l don't think anyone will be willing to go to her house. So what should we do then, Jasmeet ? l have an idea! - What? Let's not do anything. Let's not send anyone to her house! Let's not send anyone. She'll understand then. This seems like a good plan. - lt's a good idea, right? Ya! - So it's done then! Cheers! - Cheers dear, cheers! To you too. Hi! Hi! Hi! l'm Abhay.

But l can't even leave you home alone, right? So let's do one thing, let's become friends. OW! Tania! Now get out of the house or else l'll call the police! Police? But what have l done? Nothing. But if l tell them that you were doing bad things with me, then who do you think they will believe? You or me? Look, let's make a deal. Let me stay here till your mother gets back and in exchange l'm ready to do anything for you. l'll do anything. Anything. Anything? Number 1 ! Clean the house! Hey! You missed a spot. Tania's homework! Yes! Back to work. Piano lessons. Ewww! Yuck! Boring! Don't worry. l won't ask you to play the piano. l hate it.

Tania Merchant this is, this is just not done. You can't treat people like this. l mean, look at this poor man, what have you done to him? You think it's funny? You think it's funny? Because it's really not, Tania Merchant, it's his niceness that he's stayed here for so long. Anyone else would have left you alone and gone long ago. l'm really, really sorry, and thank you so much for.. l know that Tania must have troubled you a lot and l can see it. But you see, l really need a nanny like you. And it's OK that you're a man, it's totally fine. Do you think that you could forgive Tania and take this job? But Mom! The thing is that l need to tell you something.. Ya, ya, sure! Totally! Say whatever you need to say but please take this job. You know. Just come with me one second. - Ya. You see, no one has been able to handle Tania like this and l'm a divorced single working mother. lt's difficult. l'm ready to give you anything, l'll double your salary, how about that? No, you don't understand what l'm trying to say. l've come to tell you something really important. OK fine! Triple. But that's it OK.. please. l need to tell you something really..

And you're the one who told me to go speak to her, so l went to speak to her and she employed me as her nanny. Now what? Now nothing, Dad. l'll have to clean the house, cook food, and take care of her daughter. Ya! l almost forgot to tell you. Alisha is a single, divorced mother who lives here with her daughter. Daughter? Ya, Dad! A six-year-old monster who is intent on ruining my life. So wish me luck, Dad.. for my new job. But.. but son.. she is a single mother, she has a six-year-old daughter and you still.. l know what you're thinking, Dad. But all this doesn't make a difference to me. For me Alisha will always be Alisha. Anyway, l gotta go, Bye! Taxi! Hold my bag.. That's it. Stop. Stop. Stop. Hey, Abhay. You are a little late today, no? But that's not important.

No no! l really like girls. l love girls. l love everything about them.. you know. - lt's fine. Ya.. ok. l really really like.. Ok Anyway, what about your marriage? Oh.. l'm so sorry, l forgot.. l'm so.. so sorry. No no no, it's ok. l didn't mean to.. No. lt's not a big deal.. l was very young when l got married. l mean l was what? Like.. 1 8. And like it usually happens, the guy turned out to be a jerk and we got divorced. After that l didn't want to stay in lndia any longer, and anyway it's not like he was interested in taking care of Tania. So, when l got a job in Singapore, l took it and we moved here. A new life, a new beginning. Lets talk about something else ya.. ok. And again l'm really sorry about.. Oh, it's fine. - Ya? lt's fine. - Ok Don't worry about it. Ok So, what work do you do in Singapore? There is this software company called Pinnacle Technologies. l'm the PR and marketing.. Hi Mom! Came to say Goodnight. Hey pumpkin.. who's that? varun.. l'll tell you.. hey! Hey rock star! - What's up? Who's varun? l don't know. Ok, Goodnight! Goodnight froggy four eyes! Ya.. so maybe Alisha. Bye. Goodnight. Oh bye, goodnight. Oh, no, no one. That's just Tania's nanny. Ya, so you were saying. Hello Dad. Abhay.. is everything alright? No - What happened? Alisha? Son, the one girl you couldn't forget for seven years has come back into your life. Do something so that she gets to know the real you. And what will that accomplish Dad? Well, anything can happen. Love? C'mon Dad. This is Alisha remember? She won't even look at guys like me.. this love is impossible. Son, the ones who win in life aren't always the stronger, faster, clever ones. ln the end, the one who wins is the one who believes in himself. The question here is, do you believe in yourself? l don't know Dad.. So then find out. Because this impossible love story can only be made possible by you and no one else. You're right dad. You're right.. let me call you back ya?.. Bye.. Good luck. Possible.. Possible.. ya.. CP, you do understand how much of my time and effort has gone into developing this software? Of course, varun. l completely understand. Great! So then, according to you, how much would it all be worth? A sum this large has never been offered to anyone before in the entire history of this company. Mr. Sanghvi. CP.. in the company's history this offer might be large but according to me it's not. Alright, Mr. Sanghvi. Why don't you tell us what you expect? Double this offer, give me a twenty percent partnership in the profits, and you have a deal. You play hardball, Mr. Sanghvi. Please call me varun. l may not like your methods, varun.. .. but l have full faith in this software. We can seal this deal on one condition. lf l accept your terms then all your program files, your entire software and any other related work.. .. has to be handed over to me. And all these files will be put into this company's secure server. Sure. So do we have a deal then? We sure do! Congratulations! - Thanks. Congratulations, Sir! - You too. Congratulations, Mr. Sanghvi. Ms. Merchant, it was a pleasure doing business with you. Well varun, l think you can now call me Alisha.. OK, Alisha. l think we should celebrate this moment. What do you think? For sure! Great! So then, may l take you out to dinner? Well, logically, you are our guest. So l should be the one taking you out to dinner. l'm okay with that! l'm sorry to interrupt but this software has to be put into the company's server right now. C'mon, let's go. - Right. OK. Boss is calling. - Yeah! OK. Come, varun. - After you. Thank you. - Thanks. This way. As you can see, this facility is completely secure. The internal network is directly accessed from here, and only senior personnel are allowed access to this room. That's right. lt is your destiny, Luke! No way, Jos! - Jos? Who's Jos? He wasn't a Jedi! Do l look like l care? Look, Mom, l'm a Jedi! Ya! And it looks like a lot more fun than homework! What homework? Tania! Tania! She's just kidding. Until she finishes her homework l never let her play. Never. l'm sure. Abhay, could l have a word with you? Upstairs. Why? l mean ya, ya, sure! Now? OK. Hello? Abhay! - Hi! Hi! Come on in. Actually l just need some advice. A man's point of view. Ya, sure. Why don't these things ever work? l hate them, man! lf you like, may l? You understand these things? A bit. Shut up! Really? Come. Come. Come. l never get network, it's like www-wayovermyhead.com. Have a seat. OK, so the problem is there's this guy in office, varun. And he's asked me out to dinner. That's not the issue, the problem is l work with him, you know. And l know l shouldn't mix my personal.. .. and professional life but l mean technically, he doesn't even work in my office. He's just like my client. He's like really cute, you know how it is? - Ya, ya. What should l do? l.. - OK, so l have two choices. One, that l go out with him for dinner. Alone, like a date.. but it's too early. Two, that l invite him home, but that's just too intimate. Unless l invite some people from the office as well? Right! - Ya! That's great! Because inviting everyone over for dinner will make sure the situation remains casual. And it means we are still meeting for dinner. l like it! Ya, me too.. You're fab. Thank you very much. l feel so much better now, really! Any time. Thanks! Oh! But listen, hey, we'll have the dinner tomorrow and.. Rohan, Madeleine, CP, Sumitra.. .. you'll manage cooking for six people, right? Ya. Oh! And l love Thai food. You know how to cook Thai food, right? Thai food? Ya, ya! Of course! Really? - Ya. That is so cool. You can do just about everything! Ya! G'night. - G'night. Shut up! You fixed this? Why didn't you come into my life earlier, Abhay? But it's never too late, so g'night! G'night. Thai food! Thai Tradition.. OK! Soup? - Check! Prawns? - Check! Chicken Satay? - Check. Check! Green Curry? - Check! Hey, you guys! - Rice.. - All set? What? ls the dress too short for the dinner party? The colour, right, l knew l should have worn red. Froggy! Ya? Ya! No! lt's just you.. you're looking beautiful. You guys sure? lt's true, Mom. You're looking mummalicious! Hey! - Hey, hi Alisha! Hi! Sumitra, l'm so glad you could make it. Please come in. You look stunning! - Thank you! This is a small gift from us. Oh! That's really kind of you, thank you so much! Come on in. l must say you've done your place up really well. Ya? Thanks! Just give me a second l'll be right back. Ya ya! Sure. - Thank you. Good evening! Hey! Wow! You're looking beautiful. A little something for you. Thanks.. you shouldn't have. Come on in. CP's already here. ls he? - Ya, and his wife Sumitra as well.. Oh my God! This is varun? What happened, Froggy? - What happened? You're acting like you've seen a ghost! Tania. Do me a favour. Please go upstairs. l beg of you, please! Jesus, Froggy! Fine! l'm going. Goodnight. You guys know each other.. Hi.. how are you? Traffic sucks out here.. - varun that's Madeline. Sidhu is varun. varun is Sidhu. Are we ready for dinner? OK. Oh no! How will l be in front of him? Think, Abhay, think! Alisha, you did a very good thing by inviting varun. So, then what's for dinner Alisha? Oh! You'll find out soon enough. First a toast! Oh God! Why did he have to sit in the front? To Unify? To Pinnacle and Unify. Anyway.. What are you doing? Good evening. For madam. Thank You! What are you doing? Amusing! l'm really sorry.. he just likes feeding people.. backwards! CP, why don't we tell varun a bit about the presentation? Ya, varun.. - Soup! Strange! Excuse me. Abhay, serve the soup! - No! What do you mean, no? Self-service! Thai tradition. Apparently, self-service is a Thai tradition. Self-service it is! Maybe some wine.. voila! For you.. So.. Madam.. Soup! Oh my.. my china! lt's fine. Hi! Continue! Amusing.. Thai tradition? Hello - Hello, madam! ls Mr. varun Sanghvi there? varun Sanghvi? Yes, madam. There's a phone call from Mumbai, very urgent, for Mr. varun Sanghvi. OK, hold on please. varun - Ya? There's a call for you on my landline. Here? For me? Strange. lt's.. it's right down the hall. OK, excuse me. Ready for dinner? Hello? - That's a quiet entry. Hello? l hope you all like the food because.. Chicken.. oh satay, l love satay! Prawns.. Ya, oh good, good. Curry and rice. Enjoy. Enjoy. - Thank you Thank you, Abhay. -You're welcome. Strange. - What happened? lt got disconnected. Don't know who it was? Oh! l'm sorry. Bon Appetit! This Thai cook of yours.. is a bit strange.. .. but he makes very tasty food. Ya.. So Alisha, what do we have for dessert? Surprise! Chocolate cake! Surprise indeed. Hello! Hello Sir! - Hi! Your chocolate cake. Let me guess, Thai tradition? Enjoy! Thank you. l am so sorry about that. l have no explanation. Oh God! l did it! Hi! Hi! - Oh my God! l love chocolate. Really? - Yes. You want some? You know what? - What? You look tired. No.. l'm fi.. - Nonsense! Let me help you. Help me? You.. you wanna help me? Ya? OK, sure! Here, here.. why don't you serve the coffee? Here, take it! Thank you! This way. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank You. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thai tradition! G'night. - lt was great fun Alisha. Thank you very much. l'm so happy you had a good time. - Ya, thanks! Thai tradition! - Oh God! Ya! Nothing like it. Thanks so much. G'night. - Bye! Finally! A chance to be alone. Some more wine for you? Sure. Thank you. To Unify. To.. you and l. Cheers! Cheers! Did l tell you how absolutely stunning you look tonight? Actually you did.. but you can tell me again. l don't mind. OK, well l.. well you are.. who is that? l'm sorry, l forgot, but that's my.. Cook? Chocolate boy? He's still here? Yeah. Don't you think he should be leaving by now? Oh.. - Yes. Hi! - Hi! What were you doing at dinner tonight Abhay? What was l doing? Oh.. you know.. Whatever! We'll talk about it tomorrow. And these dishes? These can be done tomorrow too, right? Ya.. but l don't like leaving dirty dishes like this. l'll just finish it in two minutes. lt's almost done.. Abhay! Oh.. - Ya! Kinda.. Oh, fine.. OK, OK, OK. So then ya.. Ya. - Ya, OK. OK - l'll go then. OK. OK. - Goodnight. Goodnight. He just left. Your wine - Thank You So where did we leave off last? What the hell is this? What's going on? Tania! l'm really sorry, varun. Bizarre things happen to me quite often, but this one even l can't explain. l just.. lt's OK, you're still very beautiful. Anyway, this means that you'll have to take me out to dinner again, or let me take you out? We'll see. - OK. Goodnight. - Sweet dreams. Here. Souvenir, don't worry about it. Aw.. thank you! Thai tradition! Hello Sidhu. Abhay.. Ya. Abhay.. good to see you again. Please come join me. Sit down. Please. Cappuccino, right? - lt's OK. So, Abhay.. what brings you to Singapore? You know exactly why l'm here. l've come looking for you, to take my software back. The software that you stole from me, Sidhu. varun. The name is varun. This is the problem with you people. Always so serious in life, you've got to relax. Calm down. l'll relax once l get my software back. See, you're going on about that again. Abhay, l'll only say this once, so listen carefully. ln this world there are two types of people. People like you, who make things, and people like me who sell those things. And in today's day and age without people like me, people like you would be nowhere. l mean, take a look at yourself. You still live with your parents in their house, and are a burden on them. That's sad. Why would anyone want to invest in you? lts all about marketing, you understand what l'm saying, right? Ya, l.. l understand. l understand very well. But what you haven't understood is that.. .. if people like me don't make things, what would people like you sell? And varun, whatever you say can't change the fact that eventually you're nothing but a thief. Thief? That's a big word. Abhay, l'm just a businessman, besides, do you have any proof? No, right? Look Abhay, because you're a good guy l want to help you. Abhay Sharma, right? This is a cheque for 50,000 dollars, you can only dream of making this kind of money. And this can be yours now, just take it and go back to lndia, and forget about this software. Take it! You know, varun. l've spent my entire life living under people like you. Even in college l would do their homework, finish their projects, submit papers. l would do everything, and the result was that people like you moved forward and l got left behind. But now, enough is enough, l can't do this anymore. So put that cheque away, varun.. .. because now l'm not like that any more. Now l would rather help myself and not you all. Wow! That's great but you're too late. The deal is done, the software has been sold and in a few days it will be officially launched. This money is the only thing you'll get out of this. You want to help yourself, right? Then listen to me, take the cheque. varun. l'm giving you another chance, return my software to me. Or else what? What can you do? Something l don't want to do. l'll have to show the entire world that you're a thief. You're a fool. This is the difference between you and me. l've given you an opportunity to change your life but you don't want to take it. You're forgetting one thing, varun. Till l have this, my life is in my hands, however much anyone might try to rob from me. And one more thing, you can change your life with this, not with that. Good luck. Go for it. The exit's there. OK, varun. Excuse me. - Yes? l.. l'm looking for the recruitment office. Human Resources? lt's on the first floor. That way please. - Thank you. Ankert University, California? Honours student? Great qualifications. Good. So do l get the job? You know what kind of a job this is, right? l know, Sir. You'll have to repair computers, that's it. Sure, Sir. l can do that. l don't think you understand what l'm saying. This job is not worth your while, its very simple, inferior work. How can l give someone like you a job like this? Sir, if you think this work is too inferior then think of me as an inferior man and give it to me. OK. Come to work from tomorrow. Sir, can l start from today? Of course you can! By all means. Thank you. Sir, l have one request.. l won't be able to come to work at nine in the morning as l have another job. As soon as l finish that l'll come here.. if it's OK with you? Son, with your qualifications, there are no time restrictions for you. Just finish the work properly. - Of course! l know this won't be too much trouble for you. Thank you, Sir. Ask Helen for your uniform and lD-card on your way out. - OK, sir. OK. Alright. - OK. All the best, my boy. - Thank you, Sir. Take care. - Thank you, thank you. God bless you! You will be happy to hear that the media is very excited about this. Enquiries are pouring in so l have a little plan set up that l want to show you. - Let's go How we'll take this forward, yeah? varun, do you think we can put this onto mobile phones as well, the software for.. Froggy! We're staging a play in school on Friday and the teachers have put me in charge. And l don't know how l'll manage this so fast. You'll have to do everything, Froggy! You have to help me! Of course l'll help you, Tania. Anyway it's getting late, say goodnight, OK? Sweet dreams. You like my mum, right? Tania.. you shouldn't say things like this. Go to sleep, OK? Goodnight! OK. But if you really do like my mum then l can help you out. Help? Help how? l knew it! You like her! You like like her! No, no, no, when did l say this? When did l say this? You don't need to say anything, Froggy. lt's clearly written on your face. Whenever mommy comes in front of you then you should take a look at your face. You get that silly smile. lts so obvio! Tania, you do know that you're just six years old, right? Yes! But in these matters l'm your grandmum. So say! What? - That you love my mum, stupid! Smiling won't help. lf you need my help then you have to speak up! OK.. - Ya, OK, what? Ya, OK.. l love her. l didn't hear you.. l love her, OK? How sweet! But there's a big problem.. Problem? What problem? varun.. Ya, varun.. And if l know mom then he's just her type. She likes idiots like him. What? We'll have to do something, Froggy! And we'll have to do it quickly or else everything will get ruined. But what can we do? Don't worry! l like you and l hate him. Meet me outside school tomorrow. Tania will take charge. Give me five! OK! So what's the plan? The problem is that you're just not mum's type. l know.. - And to change you is also impossible. So what should l do? Nothing much. Just spend sometime with each other.. alone! Alone? - Ya, she has to get know you, stupid! But alone.. where? At home. l've planned everything. l'm going to be spending tonight at a friend's place, so that you two can be alone. OK. Now you go to your hotel and l go home. That's sad. l'll see you tomorrow. - Goodnight, sweet dreams. Goodnight - Goodnight. No Tania, you can't watch Sex and the City! Watch Hannah Montana.. OK.. lights out at 1 0 o'clock. Bye! Abhay! - Hi.. You're still here.. let me help you. l need some advice from you.. again! Ya, sure! Of course. You know varun? Remember the guy l spoke to you about and.. l think you met him at dinner. - Ya, ya, ya.. Thai tradition.. so what do you think? What do you think about him? l don't understand. OK. l think. l think he's going to ask me out, like on a date.. officially.. and l don't know what l want.. so what do you think? What should l do? Well.. do you love him? Love? No, no, no, no. lt's too soon, l mean.. and anyway.. love is a fantasy. Not that l'm negative about love or anything. ln fact in school and college l used to believe in love and fairytales. You know, l used to believe that my prince charming would come and carry me off on his motorcycle. And someone did come into my life, except that he wasn't any prince charming. Anyway, after that l stopped believing in these things. Cause.. now if l find anyone who keeps me happy and more importantly accepts Tania in his life, then that's all. That's more than enough. And do you feel that varun is that guy? Maybe.. Well if he makes you happy then l mean, l mean you should do whatever makes you happy. You're right. ln any case, what are you doing here? All this can be done tomorrow. And even Tania is at her friend's place. You could have had the evening off. What would l have done with an evening off? You know, l would have just got bored in Singapore.. Are you kidding? Singapore is such a nice place, and the girls here are very pretty. You're a single guy, you should be having fun. l can't do all this! Why not? C'mon! You never know, right? lt's possible that some special girl is waiting for you here and she'll never find you because you'll be here doing the dishes. Such special girls don't wait for guys like me. What kind of logic is that? Why not? Because just like you.. these girls are also looking for their prince charming.. Fine.. - Ya.. and l'm no prince charming. l mean take a look at yourself, you're a beautiful girl. You're beautiful and.. Thanks! You're welcome! lf you go out looking for men, there will be a line outside your door. There's not going to be a line-up of girls waiting for me. l doubt it. Do you seriously believe that people are attracted to each other only on the basis of their looks, cause that's really shallow. Ya! l agree, but that's the way of the world. l didn't make these rules. Well, it's a stupid rule. Because there are so many other qualities besides beauty. Like intelligence, charm, personality.. Really? Ya, really! And if l prove you wrong.. How? Let's have a bet. l'll bet with you but how will you prove it? What? Do you even know how to use these? No! But that's the point. C'mon, these are Tania's! Even better! Black? Do you like make-up? Ya.. - Good! Time to take it off. l clean my computer screen with this! Screensaver! Great! Now wear it. And for the final touch. And you? Spare! Ready? l think so.. No way, man! Yes way, man.. Are you mad? Who looks like this? l can't go out like this, this is totally embarrassing. Makes me look totally stupid. - So, bet's off? Give up? l win? Come on! OK, fine, fine! Me here, like this.. what's the plan? The plan is, you here, like this.. it's impossible that any guy will even glance at you. What rubbish! - Ya! - lmpossible! lmpossible according to me, but as you can see there are so many bars.. if you can get even one guy's phone number.. Then you'll believe me? - Ya. That's all? - Ya, just keep it geek, yeah? Ya. OK. OK. l can do that, that's simple. Watch and learn. - l will. Everyone here may not be beautiful yet, two hearts can still meet.. lt's possible. Hey.. it's possible Through the sheer strength of my heart l will find someone And if not love at least A phone number l will get lt's possible Hey.. it's possible lt can happen lt's possible lf it has to happen, lt can lt's possible Maybe, but love.. .. ,love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. No, no, love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. No love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. l can make you feel good With my stories And make you laugh all night Whatever you ever want l will give And in my depths l'll have you lose yourself The one who is near you ls truly blessed. lt can happen lt's possible lf it has to happen it can lt's possible Maybe, but love.. .. love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. No no no no Love impossible l say it's possible Love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. We'll talk about random things With tea And at night About fireflies Your soft light laughter With a pinch of sadness l'll give my heart away to you ln the midst of all this lf they could only see me Not judge me let me be me lt can happen lt's possible lf it has to happen lt can lt's possible Maybe, but love.. .. love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. Love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. Love impossible lt's possible, hey ya.. lmpossible lt's possible, hey ya.. No no impossible lt's possible Love lmpossible lts possible, hey yaa No No love lmpossible lt's really possible Just not possible Trust me it's possible Love lmpossible l just can't believe how people can be this shallow. l'm.. l'm sorry. l'm just really upset. l'm sorry, Alisha. l didn't mean to upset you. lt's not your fault, Abhay. ln fact, you were right! l guess these are the ways of the world. Alisha.. l can't change the way the world functions but to me.. you'll always be beautiful. You'll always be special. And if you ever need me, l'll be there. Of all days, l think, today is the day l needed to hear that the most. Thanks, Abhay. Hey, check this out! That's the new Air with the faster processor and, oh my God! Does it have Snow Leopard? l didn't know it was, it was out.. What are you saying, Abhay? You must really like these computers and things, ya.. lt's my second love actually,.. Second? No.. what l mean is.. whenever l feel sad l come to a place like this. ln fact, in Singapore l come here itself. l hate them by the way.. hey, varun! Coffee now? l.. .. actually l'm with a friend right now, l don't think l'll be able to make it.. you're OK with that, right? OK. Bye. Coffee? - Yeah.. - OK.. OK, boys and girls.. rehearsal time. Krish, come here, come here, come here. You sing after me, OK? Say bada bada boom.. Bada bada boom. very Good. Bada Bada.. - Move fatso! So? - So? What happened last night? Give me the goss, Froggy? Nothing, nothing like that.. but it was nice. Nice, huh? Sweet! See, l told you l would help you, right? l know. You're the best ,Tania. Thank you! Now go try on your costume. l have to go. OK, everybody. Tomorrow is the launch of the software. Alisha, would you run us through the schedule please? Yes, of course. OK. So the event is scheduled to begin at l think you should know that a number of channels will be broadcasting it live across the world. Gotcha! l will begin the event. A little brief on Pinnacle, then l will go on to introduce varun who will present the software and then the floor will be open for questions and answers. Alisha, l'm impressed. Just doing my job, varun. That will be all, thanks for coming. All the best. Bye.. Alisha! - Ya! lf you're not doing anything tonight.. would you like to go out? Oh, varun.. tomorrow is a very big day and l think we should both get some rest. Some other time perhaps? Ya.. for sure, yeah. You're right! We need to get some rest.. ,for sure but is everything alright? Ya! Of course. Good luck for tomorrow! Good luck to you too! - OK. Mom! My school play is tomorrow, you remember, right? Of course, T. - You have to be there for the whole play. Obviously! ln fact l've told CP that l'm going to be coming late for the launch, how cool is that? Cool! And Froggy, you have to be there too! Of course, Tania. l'll be there. OK, now enough, go to sleep, OK? OK, Goodnight. - Goodnight. Hey, Froggy! l'm sorry, goodnight sweetheart. - Goodnight. Ya.. keep this with you.. there you are, sweet dreams. Goodnight! - Ya, goodnight! Abhay? - Ya? Coffee? l'm making it so you know it'll be special. l'd love to, Alisha! Yes, Alisha! You can say anything.. anything. l'd love to. lf you don't mind can l ask you a question? lt's a little personal. Ya, ya, ya. - Don't look so worried. No, no, no. Please.. please ask. OK. So last night you told me about your second love, right? So, l'm presuming that there is a first love. l know you've never had a girlfriend, so what's the deal? You really want to know? Ya. So, ya.. there was a girl. The truth is that l'm still in love with her. Oh! That.. that's really sweet. Wow! Who is she? There is a girl. lt's been seven years now and she still doesn't know. ln fact, she doesn't even know who l am. Wait a minute. lt's been seven years? Oh my God! You're such a loser! Ya.. ya.. That's ridiculous! You mean to say that you've been in love with this girl for seven years and she has no clue? You know that's stupid, right? - Ya. Any girl would want a guy to be madly in love with her. ln fact, she'd fall in love with you there and then! Oh really? - Ya! lf she does that she'll be making a mistake. She should love me for me, not just because l love her. Anyway, where is she nowadays? Probably having coffee in some corner of the world.. with some loser.. you know how it is? Alisha.. l want to say something to you.. Tell me.. l don't know what you'll think once you hear what l have to tell you.. l'm not really sure.. Try me.. Surprise! Surprise! varun? - A little something for you. Thank you! Well aren't you going to invite me inside? Of course. Please come in. - Thank you! So how you doing? Everything OK? Ya, ya.. varun that's Abhay.. Abhay that's.. You? What are you doing here? l could ask you the same thing, varun. You both know each other? Ya well.. - l was going to tell you everything Alisha.. How do you know him? Abhay is Tania's nanny. He takes care of the house. Nanny? Nanny! Hi! Nanny. He's no nanny. He's been lying to you. His name is Abhay Sharma and he is really my nanny. He's a madman who's been following me from lndia. He's been trying to steal my software. He wants to steal it and fool us all, right? He's crazy, Alisha. By living in your house, he wants to use you to get to me. That's a lie, Alisha. A lie? So tell me, haven't you been following me from lndia? Yes, l have been following him. - Thank you! Because the software is mine! He's stolen it from me. Your software? lt's his software? You're lying again? l'm not the liar, you are. - l'm the liar? Ya - l'm the liar? One second. Alisha, why don't you ask if he's a nanny at all? Alisha, please don't listen to him. So answer his question then, Abhay. - Please. Are you a nanny or not? No. Exactly!

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. l have a very important announcement to make here today. The reason why Unify is not working is because Mr. varun Sanghvi is not.. .. the original programmer of this software. What? Alisha, what are you doing? l'm really sorry, but varun is not the original programmer of Unify. Just.. just trust me. Please! l'd like to call upon the original programmer of this software. Mr. Abhay Sharma. Alisha! Have you gone mad? You know l've developed this software, not that crazy guy! varun, don't.. - Alisha, explain! CP, you trust me, right? Just listen to Abhay once, that's all l'm saying. CP.. - varun, shut up! CP.. what is happening? l just can't take this! varun. l want to hear what he has to say. Thank you! Abhay.. l told you, varun. l also gave you a chance. You didn't listen to me. Now l'm sorry. Sir, he's a fraud. He met me in Mumbai, stole my software and came to Singapore to sell it to you. Whatever he's said to you is a lie. He's nothing but a thief. CP, this man is crazy. Anyway, what proof does he have? The proof is in front of your eyes, sir. What do you mean? - On the screen. OK, so you're responsible for all of this? lf he locked the software with a password what am l supposed to do? And how did he get access to the.. - Ya! l've done it. But according to you, you made this software. - Yes, of course! So if that's true and anyone locks it with a password, then you should be able to bypass it easily. Sir, a real programmer would know this software so well that he'd easily be able to restart it. CP! - Just ask him to start it! CP! l don't know what he's talking about! Just get the password and get him out of here.. varun, why don't you do something? Because he can't. You know that even if you want, you can never restart it because you never created this software. CP.. - Abhay, can you start this software? Ya, l just have to enter the password and it'll start. Fine! Fine! You bastard! What is it? What's the password? Give it to me. l'll give you the password but you'll have to promise me that you'll Give Abhay the exact same deal that you gave varun. Exact same, CP. OK, promise. Exact same.. now give me the password. OK, what is the password? You give the password.. Abhay, l don't know the password. What's the password? Of course you know what the password is, Alisha. lf you don't know then who will.. Can one of you please give me the password? Please! Alisha! Alisha! That's your password CP.. What? Alisha.. my name. Congratulations! Today you've become a really rich man. Sir, this way please. l.. l think l should. l think you should.. Just say it.. l love you.. l know.. Froggy!
