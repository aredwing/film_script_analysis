So, an open casting, Sebastin? Fucking great. I told you this would happen. Hello. Good morning. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. How's it going? They all want to be seen, and there are hundreds... Okay, well, tell them that we don't need any more. We'll just see the ones here. The rest can leave. No, Costa, wait, we can't do that. Shit, we can't see them all, Sebastin. If you prefer, pick the ones you like and get rid of the rest. But do it now! Come on. Come on. Come on. Choose the ones you like. -Hello. -Pleasure. Could you go with the girl? Yes? How are you? Go ahead. Yes, go ahead. They're very good. -How many men are going? -Five, and two women. Okay, okay. Okay. -Hello. Could you go? -Yes. Yeah? Thank you. And we're not going to go? Uh, yes. Okay, in a -- in a minute. -Sebastin? -What? -We've got enough. -Already? We've got more than enough inside, and this is pointless. We have to tell them to leave. Well, apologize to them. -This can't be. -Come with me, please. Sorry, sorry. We're very sorry, really. I'm sorry. We don't need anyone else. No, we can't see everybody. There are too many. No, no, you have to be able to. We've been waiting for hours. You have to go, gentlemen. We can't see anyone else. No, Ma'am, we're not leaving. We're going to wait here until we're seen. -Listen, didn't you hear her? -I did, but -- You have to leave. You have to go. -Get out of here! -Hey, bastard! Get out of here! You have to leave! Enough! Enough! -Enough! Enough! -What's going on? Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy! Calm down, calm down, calm down! What's wrong? "Everyone gets a chance." That's what it says. And my girl wants to act. Yeah, her and 200 others, but we can't see them all, understand? You don't understand, white face. We've been waiting for hours. Some have come from very far on foot. Now you tell us to leave. You have to see all of us. We're not leaving until you see us all. We're not moving from here! Tell him anything, but get rid of him. -What's your name? -Daniel. Daniel. All right, Daniel's right. We're going to see everyone. -Fuck! -Okay? We'll see you all, no matter how long it takes. Sebastin, we have to leave. Yes, calmly, though, calmly. Okay? Okay. Film that bastard for me. And his daughter, too. He's good. Okay, as you heard, we're going to see everyone. -Let's go! -Let's go. EVEN THE RAIN Costa, are you crazy? Slow down! Sebastin, tell me something. We're in Bolivia. It doesn't make much sense. Because we're 7,500 feet above sea level, surrounded by mountains, and thousands of miles from the Caribbean. Well, Costa thinks Columbus landed by parachute. No, Costa knows this place is full of starving natives, and that means thousands of extras. None of that digital shit. I want scale, all the money up on the screen. No, Costa, no. This could be a mess, really. Have you seen their faces? Please, they're Quechua. -So? -What do you mean, "so?" They're from the Andes! What's Columbus doing with natives from the Andes? From the Andes or wherever, they're natives. -That's what you wanted, isn't it? -Oh, no, no, no, no. Give me a fucking break. They're all the same. No. You can negotiate things here -- hotels, transport, catering, whatever. So, it's about money. Yes, yes! It's always money, always, always. Well, in this case, very little money, right? Right, you miserable cheapskate? If we'd filmed in English, we'd have double the money and double the audience. Almost had the deal done till you fucked it up. Because Spaniards speak Spanish. What if we'd done it in English? We'd have been fucking smart. So, the Spaniards speak Spanish, and the Tainos that Columbus found speak Quechua? Is that how you're going to be? I just want to know. We'll do it, Sebastin! Up! Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! That's it! Careful! Costa, slowly, it's very dangerous! Come on, come on, come on. Pull it up! -Careful! Careful! -Watch out! Everyone all right? Okay, let's see if we can do this. Come on! No, Costa, please. We have to do it some other way! It has to be done another way, please. One, two, three... Up! One, two, three... Up! Once more, on three. One, two, three... Up! Alley-oop! Listen, Costa, we should've gotten professionals and used a crane! Things can't be done like that. Someone could get hurt! Yeah, and an engineer, too. Do you know how much we've saved? Great work, guys. The beers are on me. Turn that fucking thing off! -Sorry. -It's okay. I hope I can get through this. Is he drunk? Are we all here? We are now. All right, when you're ready. We see the stunned faces of Taino children hiding in the bushes. From their point of view, we see Columbus and his men landing in the New World. Some small boats are on the shore. The children are hit by a disgusting smell while the strange creatures, wet and dirty, some bearded, others bald, stumble on the sand. The children laugh and make comments, trying to understand who these strangers are -- I, Christopher Columbus, humble servant of King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile, in the name of Jesus Christ, Son of the one true God, take possession of these lands and seas and all they contain. And with this act... ...I proclaim sovereignty over these lands and seas on behalf of their most gracious Majesties. Let us thank the Virgin Mother for delivering us with good health to this great triumph. This must be their village. Thank God, they look peaceful. A good site for a fortress. Mingle with them. The first man to find gold will be rewarded. Captain... treat them well. We need their food. And find out what arms they have. Admiral! Quickly! You have to see this! -Gold! -Gold. -Gold. -Gold. -Gold. -Gold. It's gold. Where is the gold? Gold! Where is the gold? You know what I'm talking about! Gold! Where is it? Who gives a shit about gold? I need a fucking drink! Forgive me, Miss. We actors are totally selfish. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Remember him? See the look in his eyes? The piercing stare, really deep. He's little, but he's got great presence. Yeah, and he stinks of trouble, too. -And he's never acted in his life. -No, but I'm the director. It's an advantage. He's very natural. What about the Peruvian actor? He's terrible, totally predictable. No. No, no. But this one's a troublemaker. You saw what he stirred up at the casting the other day. He's a leader. You're looking for a leader. Costa... I want him and his daughter. No, don't fuck with me, I don't want this guy on the fucking shoot. He'll wreck it. I don't want him. That's it. Let me show you something. Look. -What's this? -Who's that? I know perfectly well who it is. When did you shoot this? -This morning. -Without telling me? Look, look, look! Hatuey! Fuck, it's Hatuey! -Right? -He's very good. -It's amazing! -Okay, he's Hatuey, fantastic. You're not going to be able to control this guy. You're going to regret it. Just remember I told you so. He's right in a way. But the film comes first, always. As governor of this island, I want to thank you for coming to see me. After my first voyage, I spoke personally with their Majesties, who instructed me to treat you with respect and cordiality. We ask that you recognize the Church and the Pope as rulers of the universe. And also that you accept the King and the Queen of Spain as rulers of these lands. In exchange, you will receive our love and our charity. And if we do not? Captain... If not... we will enslave you and dispose of you as we wish. We will seize your possessions and we will do you as much harm as we can. What do you want from us? Taxes. Every Indian over the age of 14 must fill a bell. What did he say? With what? With gold. Here. It isn't very big. Captain. Alberto, can you tell us about your character? Well, my character is Bartolome de las Casas. He came to the lndies when he was 18 to take charge of a plantation and the Indian slaves who worked there. But later, traumatized by the massacres he witnessed, he devoted his life to the Indians. He became a Dominican. He was nearly murdered twice. On his deathbed -- and I'm quoting verbatim. Don't laugh, listen. He said, "I condemn the blindness of those who ignore the genocide and give orders to the world". This guy was the father of international law, and I'm only in eight scenes! And you, Juan? I play Antonio Montesinos. Sebastin gave me 20 books to read, but I'm not a reader like him. My character isn't as famous as Bartolome, but he's more important. He's more important than Bartolome because I was the first to intercede for the Indians. I was the one who started everything and gave that famous sermon -- "I am the voice of Christ in the desert of this island, and you are in mortal sin!" That was me. Daniel, can you tell me what made you do this film? What do you mean? What did you like about your character? Maybe he represents native resistance or shows colonization from a different angle? He just wants the money! What? He just wants the money! Do you have love scenes? How many girls do you kiss? Do you have to strip off? A little squirt like you! No, guys. What are you digging? We're running out of water here, and between all of us, we've bought -- See that hill? We bought a well there, and now we're digging a ditch. It's about 7 kilometers long. -7 kilometers? -Yes, 7 kilometers. We're digging a ditch to bring the pipeline along the hillside and have water here. Why are you here? We're making a documentary about the film. You're asking a lot of questions. Daniel, don't trust her. Here come the bastards. They're stopping. They've stopped. What do they want? What the fuck do you want here? What are you looking for? What are you looking for here? What are you looking for? -How do you say "food"? -Mikuna. -How do you say "It was delicious"? -Ancha miski. How do you say "I love you?" Anchata munaiki. -And "wine"? -Vino also. -And "water"? -Yaku. I'll have some yaku. Nothing like getting into character. God bless you, Father. Why not fill a plastic bag with the leftovers from this meal, which costs more than what they earn in a month, and give it to them, so their scrawny children can gobble it up like starving rodents! Then you'll feel like a real missionary. Antn, relax. It's Saturday night. How long will you remember that "water" is yaku? That's not very pious, Father, but the director will cut it out, along with other important details. For example, the fact that Las Casas wanted black slaves from Africa to replace the Indians. Why not put that in the film? Don't let him needle you. No, no, no, but -- but, no, it's true. It's true. He did think that when he was young, but for a very short time. He always regretted it. -And his deal with the slave traders? -What? A mistake, a disaster that ashamed him. Don't lose your marbles, Reverend. I'm not, I'm just informing you. Until his dying breath, Las Casas condemned corrupt bishops, merchants, royal officials... The whole State hated him. -They hated him? -Yes. Listen to me. He said the Indians had been sacrificed, and I quote, "for private appetites and profits," Then cynics like you try to reduce his life to one mistake. Like in football, history is always cruel to the losers. Just cut them out and make the film about me! I'm better-looking, right? More handsome than him. He never -- Beto. He never questioned Spanish authority over the New World or royal authority. In other words, he was a conservative. He was a radical! A radical! He demanded that Indians be treated equally as Spaniards! Under the Crown! But with the Indians' consent. He was ahead of his time. How the fuck did Disney pass on this? You have an agenda. You sanctify this pair of bastards and string me up! This isn't art. It's pure propaganda. -So why are you here? -What? Why the hell are you doing it? For the gold! And for Jesus Christ! May I say something? Just one thing? I am the voice of Christ in the desert of this island! And you are in mortal sin! Good night, Cochabamba! What are you doing? What are you doing? Get the other padlock. What are you doing? Why did you break the padlock? What are you doing to the well? We dug this well with our own hands so our children could drink. You've got no right to close the well! How can we live with dirty water? You take our lands, you take our wells. Are you going to take the air, too? We're not paying more money. Don't all talk -- don't all talk at the same time. Listen to me. Listen to me. These men are doing their job. What job? Taking our water? No, Ma'am, it's not that. The well is ours. Water for our families, for our children. You are fathers, too. Because if not, we're going to fight you all the way! The water is for our children! This water is for our children! Don't take away our kids' water! All right, it's March of 1511. Boys! 10 minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, March of 1511. The Dominicans gather the rich and powerful of Santo Domingo to listen to the sermon. Bartolome is sitting there. -Here? -Yes, exactly, here. He's just like the others. He still has Indians and lands. Okay? Yes? So, yes, you're back there. We hear the hymn in Latin. It ends. A slight pause. You exchange a look with Bartolome. And we begin. The Pharisees sent someone to ask John the Baptist who he was. And he replied, "I am a voice crying in the wilderness." The Indians mine the gold which builds our cities and even our churches. Gold finances our conquests in far distant parts and so the great wheel of commerce turns. Not one of us is untouched by Indian sweat, least of all His Majesty and his bishops! As a priest, I must follow Gospel imperatives, the first of which is to preach the truth. I am the voice of Christ in the desert of this island, and you are in mortal sin! What's he saying? This man's gone mad! You live in sin, and you die in it! Why? Because of the cruel tyranny you impose on these innocents! Tell me by what right and with what justice you keep these Indians in such cruel, horrible slavery. They were living peacefully on their land! This is outrageous! By what authority have you waged such terrible war on them? By what right do you keep them so oppressed, starved, and exhausted? They're dying because of you. Or rather, you murder them! What a disgrace! This is intolerable! How can you be so asleep? How can you be so deep inside that lethargic dream? Look into the Indians' eyes. Are these not men? Do they not have rational souls? Are you not obliged to love them as yourselves? Who do you think you are? Your sermon today has called into question my authority and that of the King. You know that the Indian concessions are all legal. I demand an official retraction, Father Montesinos. The truth has many enemies. The lie has many friends. This is a capital offense! Hang the traitor! Burn him! Montesinos, go back to Spain before we cut out your tongue! Very good. He goes right for them, doesn't he? Yes, this man never retracted. No, the next Saturday, he preached the same sermon. He continued denouncing them like that for years until they killed him. In Venezuela. Yes, he was the first voice of conscience against an empire. Like that, from a little church like this. -Okay? -Yes. To the dressing room. Great. -Great. -You can continue. They sell our rivers against our will. They sell our wells, our lakes... and even the rain that falls on our heads! By law! Friends, it's incredible! They don't allow us to collect the water that falls from the rain, by law! And who takes even the rain? A company whose owners are in London and California. Friends, what are they going to steal next? The vapor from our breath? The sweat from our brow? All they'll get from me is piss! Take it easy, comrades! Take it easy, comrades... Costa, they say that they want to mobilize thousands. -So? -From the countryside... ...from the city, the unions. People are furious. No wonder, they're taking their water. They're taking their water. -Enough. -Imagine a documentary about this. Costa, let me do it. No, I'm not spending another penny. Costa, they're going to raise hell. And if we don't tell the story, we're going to let a great chance escape. I said no! I'm not a fucking NGO! This story has nothing to do with me. But you're in the middle of it! Come in. Shit, the big boss himself. Told you need a hand with this. You? Come in, come in. No one else dares enter the ogre's den. It's me, again. I've tried all the numbers. There's no way I can contact you. What's wrong? Don't the kids have my number? And the little one? Call me. Fucking machines. You got a family? Yes, a boy of 14. What's he like? Well, to be honest, I have no idea. He lives with his mother. This business fucks up families. Here. Something wrong, Antn? My bloody head! I can't remember the fucking beginning. Start at the beginning. "They are so nave --" They are so nave and generous with what they have that they never refuse anything. Whatever they have, if you ask them for it, they will give it to you, inviting the person to share it with them. I have still not found out if they have private property. With just 50 men, you could subdue them and make them do whatever you want. Whatever you want. -On the first -- -On the first island I found... ...I took several by force. Your Majesties will see that I will give you all the gold you desire in exchange for a little help. Besides spices and cotton, there are slaves, as many as you require. All of Christendom should be joyful and solemnly thank the Holy Trinity for having converted so many souls to the holy faith, and for the countless material benefits this will bring us, since not only Spain, but all of Christendom will enjoy solace and profit. No wonder you can't remember it. No one talks like that. That is exactly the first letter Columbus sent from the New World to the Spanish Crown. That's why Sebastin is so faithful to the text. I don't know if it'll work. It's a little risky, but I like it. But if he'd just give me some space to present the man, with his doubts, his anxieties... Tell him. -Why do you drink so much, Antn? -Because I'm always... very... very thirsty. But can you get through this? We are screwed without you. It's great to feel needed. Look at the size of it. -Can we go on board? -We'll ask Costa. Hi, there. They really had to fill these with gold dust? Seems so. Daniel, I saw you in a demonstration with the police. Do you realize that if something happens to you, we're fucked? Without you, we can't finish the film. Can you not keep out of this? Just three weeks. Excuse me. Yes? The money men. They saw the rushes, and they say you're great. Very good. Daniel, we're going to make a fantastic film, you'll see. No, really. Sebastin is preparing some amazing scenes -- hundreds of guys in the ravine panning for gold. Fucking epic, and you're there! You're there, man! What? Two fucking dollars, right? And they're happy. I worked in the States for two years in construction. I know this story. Belen, leave that. Come on. -We're not going on the boat? -We have to go home. Come on, come on. Stay in line. Move. Captain... What's this? Do you think I'm stupid? Are you trying to fool me? Nothing here but sand. Speak like a Christian! I don't understand you! This is sand. Have him clipped. Next. There's not enough here. There isn't enough. A lot of sand. Come on, take him away to be clipped. Father! Father! You, come on! -Well done, kid, you were great. -Thank you. -Happy? -Yes. Thank you. -Young lady, well done. -Thank you. You've got talent. A scene to be proud of. I hope they're paying you like they should. Paying me a lot more than the extras. More than the extras? My God! Do you want to know what they're paying me? -What? -Two million bolivanos. Wow. -Dad! -Hello. I've just seen the scene in the jungle. It was very interesting, yes. It was sad but interesting. I really liked it. It isn't real, but it's lovely. -You liked it? -Yes, a lot. I owe you an apology. Help! Help! It's a horrific choice... heartbreaking. You can't bear the idea that the dogs will eat the babies. We'll see you talking to Hatuey and how you understand that there's no other solution, that you have to make this decision and you have to make it together to give each other courage. So you'll take the babies... ...slowly, wade into the river, put them in the water, and drown them. Okay, how are we going to do it? We're going to do it like this. In the first take, you'll go in with the babies, and as soon as you're up to your waists, we'll stop, and we'll bring over the dolls you can see there and swap them for the babies, okay? Everything okay? Is something wrong, Daniel? Listen, it's complet-- Tell them that it's totally safe. The babies won't even get wet. They won't even get wet. When the water is up to your waist, we'll cut and bring those dolls, look. Bring those dolls so they can... Sebastin, give me a moment. Okay, but we don't have much time. What's up? I don't know. -Well? -They won't do it. Look, I know it's difficult, but we have to get them to do it. We need it for the film... Sebastin, they can't even imagine the idea of doing it. I'm not making this up. It's what happened. We have to show it. It's important for the film. Please. Sebastin, some things are more important than your film. Good Lord! God! What do I do? Nothing. Let's do the next scene. Comrades, silence, please! Listen. We're taking too long, and it's getting very hot. We're going to get tired. Comrades, we are debating the possibility of occupying September 14th Square. Comrades! And taking over the Water Company building and not budging until they give us back the water! No, that's what they want. It'll give them an excuse for another massacre. I'm not in agreement. Comrades! We all drink water, don't we? Then we all have to go on the march. Comrades, comrades, please. I don't agree. They'll beat us up. They'll gas us. What about our children? Will you look after them? We are women, we have children. We shouldn't go. How can we pay $450 a year? It's robbery. Better if they just shoot us now. Silence, please! We'll decide by voting, comrades. We'll take a vote. Those who want to fight, raise their hands and say, "The water belongs to us!" The water belongs to us! Is that Daniel? What's he doing here? After consulting with the residents... Causing trouble, what else? I told you, Sebastin. Now what? Do I lock him up? ...and with our union comrades, we, the people of Cochabamba, declare that if the privatization of water is not revoked within 48 hours, we will begin an indefinite blockade of the city and the roads! What do we want? Water! When do we want it? Now! Inside. Let's go inside. Rifle or gun, the people never run! Rifle or gun, the people never run! Thank you. -Welcome. -Thank you. -It's a pleasure to meet you. -The pleasure is mine. -I've seen all your films. -All of them? We're honored to have you in our city. Come in, please. -Thank you. -A photo of the occasion? Thank you. -This way. -Thank you. We are doubly honored that you are here to tell the story of Bartolome de Las Casas, an underestimated man, in my view. Yes, that's true. Yes, listen... Thank you for the policemen you sent us. -We feel much safer. -It's an honor for me. Wow. They're burning the water bills. Excuse me, a little domestic row. Nothing for you to worry about. Don't worry. While there's champagne to drink, "Let them eat cake," as Marie Antoinette said. It's only an excuse for some fanatics to stir up the desperate and gain a name for themselves. Forgive me for saying so, but I think their demands are reasonable. Perhaps if you were better informed... We're a country with few resources. It's hard to maintain a water supply without major foreign investment. These people think that government money grows on trees. Very good. Given their long history of exploitation, Indians' distrust is embedded in their genes. It's very difficult to reason with them, especially when they're illiterate. But that's how it is. We have objective reports from Harvard professors, the IMF... I'd love to see those bastards feed their families on 40 fucking dollars a month! Anyway, in this globalized world... -Excuse me, I'm wanted. -Of course. In this globalized world, the Indians burn water bills and hurl rocks at the police. It's the cult of victim versus modernity. I don't want to be rude, but if someone earns two dollars a day, he can't pay a 300% increase in the price of water. At least that's what I'm told. How curious. That's what I'm told you pay the extras. Yes, but we have a very tight budget. Don't we all? I'll be honest. The rumors are very worrying. This water dispute... might get out of hand and stop us from filming. I don't know if you could do something about it. I imagine you're trying to reach an agreement. If we give one inch, these Indians will drag us back to the Stone Age. Now, if you'll excuse me, make yourselves at home. Thank you. Fuck it! How is he? -They beat him up. -His face, too? We'll have to cover it with his hair. Jesus fucking Christ! Costa, make him understand if we get the scene with the cross, we're okay. If not, we're fucked, Costa. Make the bastard give his word! What the fuck are you playing at, Daniel? Can you not think of the time and effort that have gone into this film? The hundreds of people working on it, the money we're spending? If you get fucked, we all get fucked! Is three weeks too much to ask? Can no one else do this water stuff? Are you listening? Ah... playing the silent, dignified Indian? Fucking great. If we catch you at another demonstration, you won't get a fucking penny. Is that clear? I'll tell you what. We'll give you an extra $5,000 if you stay away from demonstrations until we're finished. Okay? What? Forgive me, it's beneath you. Or not enough? Eh, Daniel? Not enough? $8,000? $10,000? $10,000, Daniel, $10,000. $10,000. Half now, half when we finish! You've never seen so much money in your life! It's your only fucking chance to get out of this shithole where you live, and you're smart enough to see that! Or not? Fuck! All right. What? All right. No more demonstrations, and you'll do as we say until we're finished. Do I have your word, Daniel? Do I? Teresa, put the money away. Put it away. We're going to need it. Bruno! Shit, Bruno! I'm talking to you. Tell them to shut up, please. Okay? Please. Bruno, Bruno, are you deaf? Listen, get them to the first position. We're here to work, not to lie around. What do you want? What? -It's Costa. -Let me have it. Hi. Where are you? No, Costa, no, no, no! Where the fuck are my natives? Where the fuck is Daniel? A day of disturbances in Cochabamba. Since the crack of dawn, peasants and their allies have blockaded the city. Hundreds of city dwellers affected by the water problem have threatened to escalate actions starting next week. Hundreds of people, some from private companies, joined the protest organized by the peasants who have said, "We'll maintain the pressure." Bruno, this looks really bad. -Can we shoot like this? -Yes, we can. ...and the military forces have only caused more violence. "If they don't listen to us," citizens groups said, "We'll bring the city to a standstill tomorrow." In various parts of the city, serious confrontations... What an animal! ...demonstrators blocked key points... What a bastard! ...violent youths fought with riot police... Is that Daniel? They've smashed his face. He's a fucking idiot! They'll throw him in jail! What? What are you staring at, you drunk? Look, without the cross scene, there's no film. Right? Cris? It's Costa. How much cash can we get by tonight? Yes, tonight. $5,000. Okay. Look, Daniel's been arrested... Listen! Find out where he is and the name of the police chief, and set me up a meeting. Yes, now. Look, wait, one more thing. Call everyone and tell them that we're doing the cross scene tomorrow. I don't know, and I don't care. Yes, you heard right. Move it. That bastard won't screw us. Let's go. Here's $2,000. We need that man to finish the film. Very well. On one condition. When you finish filming, I bring him back. No. Okay. -We can't do that. -Why not? We can't. Can we talk a moment? Will you excuse us? If you'll excuse us... -Costa! -What? What if he's beaten up when he comes back? If he's tortured, killed, or disappeared? These bastards can do anything. I don't want that on my conscience. But he's in jail already! We didn't put him there. And the bastard tricked us. Without the scene, there's no film. -You fucking know that. -Yes, I know. I say we do it. Okay, but we tip him off. All right, whatever you want, but after we film the scene, or he'll be off like a shot. Shit, it's...too much... -For fuck's sake. -I can't. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Daniel? You promised me. We made a deal. You broke your word. Water is life. You don't understand. Thanks, boys. Awake all night and vomiting. I don't know if I can do this, Costa. So, now the nutcase who dragged us here says he can't do it. Do you know when I realized how crazy you were? Seven years ago. You called me at 2:00 a.m. You won't remember. "You have to hear this, Costa!" You said it was written by a priest called Montesinos in the 16th century. As if I gave a fuck. I was in a bar -- deafening music, blind drunk, everyone waiting for me. I could hardly hear you, but you kept going, yapping... From a humble straw church... One man against an empire, a voice crying in the desert. Are these not men? Do they not have rational souls? Are you not obliged to love them as yourselves? That's what got you. That's what gripped you... ...lodged in there, like a virus. You're not the kind to give up, Sebastin. You're not. You can't quit now. Come on. What's wrong? Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Come on! Let's go. Keep going. Come on, let's go. Bring them! Women, children, old people. Everyone must see this. I beg you, Commander. This will turn the Indians against us for generations. -The Crown will prosecute you! -I doubt it, Father. This isn't Christian! Choose 13, and the rest go free. One for each disciple and one for Christ Himself! Want to choose them, Father? This is a sacrilege. No, Father. It's an example. Why not join the Franciscans and save their souls? If they have any. -If he interferes, arrest him. -Come on! The Evangelists. Matthew. Mark. Luke. John. Father, help me. I've forgotten the names. -Cesar. -Carlos. -Manolo. -Paco. Federico. Felipe. Let's see. Who'll be Jesus Christ? I'll baptize you, and you'll have glory and eternal peace in Heaven. Otherwise, you'll suffer eternal torment in Hell. In the name of Christ, you can still save your soul. You must understand the difference between Heaven and Hell. Ask the Lord for forgiveness, and I'll baptize you, and you'll have glory and eternal peace in Heaven. Otherwise, you'll suffer eternal torment in Hell. Has he understood? Do Christians go to Heaven? Good Christians do. Send me to Hell! Silence! This is what will happen if you defy the Christians. What are they saying? What are they saying? "I despise you." "I despise your God." "I despise your greed." May God forgive us. Shut them up! What are they saying, Father? His name! Thanks to you, it will never be forgotten! Okay, cut! Okay, guys, that was incredible! Thank you. We're going to do it! Who is Daniel? Come with us. You're under arrest. Come with us. Get back! Excuse me! Take it easy! Take it easy! Please, please. Please, please! Get them! Leave him alone! It's like a dream. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. The Water Committee has said that if Bolivian Waters doesn't leave, blockades will continue on the streets and on access roads. The Committee has asked that the blockades continue, so the majority of roads and streets will remain in that state. The government has declared a state of emergency and has sent special police forces from La Paz to prevent acts of vandalism and violence. September 14th Square is still held by citizens. The roads linking Cochabamba with the rest of the country are still blocked. The Republic's vice-president says this is an act of subversion aimed at destabilizing a democratically elected constitutional government. It is an opportunistic protest intended to submerge the country in disorder and chaos. Guys... Guys! Guys! Guys! I'm sorry, but I'm scared. I want a ticket home right now. And I'm serious. Me too. How the fuck can you leave the film? You can't just dump us. -You signed a contract. -Don't bullshit me! -You can't even guarantee our safety! -Yes, I can. -You can't! -I can! Shut up and listen! This is an eight-hour drive away. The countryside is practically the same, and it's safe. Costa! I'm scared! Understand? Scared. And I've got a new baby. Anything could happen. I don't want to be here when it does. Run, little rabbits. Run, run. Fucking cowards. -What would Bartolome do? -Piss off. Yeah, lots of yaku, lots of "poor Indians," and now what? Fuck them! What can we do? They're telling you! Go to a safe place and finish our work! That's what we have to do! We owe it to them! I promise this place is safe. I spoke to them 15 minutes ago. They've hired private security. We'll pack essentials and get out before we're trapped. The roads are still clear. Yes, but I don't know for how long. Please, really... I'm begging you. I'm going. Come on! Come on, guys. Yes? -Yes. -Thank you. Can you hear me, Costa? We're leaving now. Okay, perfect. We're leaving, too. Get a move on. Don't wait for us. We'll catch up. Bye. They're about to close the road. We have to go now! Everyone into the cars! Come on, we're going! Who's left? Shit, wardrobe! It's always the same! Let's go! Teresa, what's wrong? I came to ask you a favor. My daughter ran off. She was playing with her friends, and they went off to the demonstration. -The demonstration? -And now she's hurt. They rang me from the post office. She's hurt? Some neighbors called me and told me she's injured. How could you leave Belen in the middle of this? If we don't go, she might die. Please, help me! Help me get her to the hospital. Please. She's bleeding badly. I'm desperate. I don't know what to do. -I'm begging you, please. -All right, I'll send someone now. No, not someone else! They won't let anyone through. The police are there. No one can get past them, but maybe you can. But I can't go. I'm about to leave with the crew. Who else can I turn to? There's no one else. -There's only you. -What's wrong? Help me, I'm begging you, please. I'm begging you. Wait here. -Something's happened to Belen. -What? I don't know. She's been hurt. Fuck! She asked me to go with her. No, you're not going anywhere. It's a war zone, Costa. -But she asked me. -You can't do anything! Don't fuck me about! Tell her you're not going. We need you with us! Please, Costa. -I'll send someone, okay, Teresa? -You have to help me, please. Help me. Don't leave me like this. No one else is any use. They won't get through. I can't go, Teresa. I'm responsible for the whole crew. I can't leave them now. I can't do it, Teresa! Come on, let's fucking go! -Let's go! -Please, you're a friend. Wait here. Just a second, Bruno. Just a second. -I'm taking Belen to the hospital. -No, no, you're crazy! No, Costa, listen to me! This confrontation is going to end, and it'll be forgotten. But our film is going to last forever. Please, come with us. If anything happens to you, we're all fucked! -Listen, listen, listen. -No, no! Listen to me for once in your life! If anything happens to that child, I'll never forgive myself. The army is on its way! They'll crush everyone! You too! -I can't leave the child there! -What can you do? I can't leave her there. -Help me out, man, please. -Fuck! Help me, Sebastin, please! You go with the crew. I just can't leave that child. I can't. You go with them. Teresa, come on. It's blocked! There's no way through. Go down there. -This way? -Yes, go down there. I can see the Water Company building. I'm at the corner. One block away. I can see the flagpole. The soldiers are entrenched behind their shields. They're armed with rifles, tear gas, rubber bullets, or something worse, I can't see clearly. But behind me, the image is an incredible sight. Young and old, people of all ages from the city, peasants and coca growers are lining up. I think they're going to the charge. There must be 2,000 of them, and more are flooding in from the side streets. Here they go! A citizens' army with sticks for weapons! What do we do? I'll talk to them. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! The army is firing with live ammo! I've seen a do zen drop, but the demonstrators still charge. Rocks against bullets! Bodies fall all around me. Do zens of injured. Fuck, Costa, answer! Pull over, Mister. We'll never get out of here, guys. No fucking way! Shit. Fuck. Get down! Belen, love, what did they do to you? What did they do to you? I'm here, love. -Are you relatives? -That's her mother. How is she? She's getting worse. She's very weak. I've got a car. We can take her and others to the hospital. No, the roads are blocked by the police. How will you get through? -With money, that always works. -Yes? All right. Belen, it's Costa. Where's Dad? Don't worry, love, he'll be here soon. I'm here now, you're not alone. I can't feel my leg. Belen, can you hear me? We're taking you to the hospital. What the hell's going on? Can't you see we're working? The others are out. What are they up to? You're a moron, shut up! Bastard! He broke his neck! Calm down! Calm down! -Bastard! -Shut up! What the fuck is this? Look out the fucking window! Just look out the window! What the hell are we doing here? Look at that! That's it. Sebastin, we're getting out. We've decided. We're going to the airport. It's over, Sebastin. Can you not see? I'm staying. Sebastin, I'm sorry, look, it's over. We're going. Maria, we're going with them. We're going, Maria. I've got your case. Sebastin, come on. So stubborn. Are you going, too? I'm sorry. Come on, Sebastin. -Antn? -No one's waiting for me. Hey, you! You can't speak to the prisoners! -Can I see her? -Yes, on you go. Doctor, how is she? Got her just in time. She lost a lot of blood, but she's stable. She'll pull through. -The thing is... -What? We saved her leg, but it's badly damaged. She'll have problems walking, if at all... I have to find her father. Thank you, Doctor. Where's the army? Stop the fighting. The water is yours. Stop the fighting. Stop the fighting. The water is yours. The water is yours. How's Belen? You're in the news everywhere. "Multinational pulls out of Bolivia after water war." That's you. It always costs us dear. It's never easy. I wish there was another way. But there's not. And the toughest bit is still to come. What are you going to do? I don't know. Help Sebastin finish this. Somehow. Somewhere. But I don't know how. And you, Daniel, what are you going to do? Survive, like always. It's what we do best. Listen, Daniel, I'm going to help you with Belen, I promise. Will you come back? I don't think so. It's a gift. Thank you. You saved my daughter's life. I won't forget that. Listen, I have to go, okay? Take good care. Please. Take care. You too. Yaku.
