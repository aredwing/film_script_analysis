You just have to trust me. Aren't you rolling? You don't even have the damn thing plugged in. I've invited some cameras to film our little sermon here today. 'Cause people have been asking, "what's going on over there at heaven's veil? What are they doing up there at that ranch? Are they being held against their will?" - Are you a prisoner here? - No. Are you a prisoner here? No. No. Just smile for the camera, people. Wave. Give me this Bible. This Bible-- this here book, this is a tool, people. And as such, it only has the power that we ascribe to it. But you, you are something much different. Your body is of the earth, yes, but you are not your body. You are mightier than the flesh. We don't need no book to tell us about the soul! Did you see any lightning come down out of that sky? I've been put here to resurrect mankind from his fallen state and bring the power of the etheric realm back into his hands. I'm gonna show you, and you, and you, and every one of ya how to push your spirit through the veil. It's a deathless reality, souls aglow with the ever-real eternal life! 30 miles outside the town of hidden lake, California, you'll find this small ranch known simply as the veil, named by the members of the heaven's veil cult, the cult that lived and died here. The FBI raided the compound this morning at 8:52 am, only to find tragedy. Every man, woman and child in this once-thriving community lies dead-- dead at the hands of their leader, Jim Jacobs. - Okay, and we're out. - Pack the Mikes. - Wait, what's that? - Everybody, stay back. - Come on! Come on! Hold it! Hold it! Hey, guys. Stay back. Don't worry. They're not dead. He's gonna bring them back. Hello? I'll do it. What? Sarah? I said I'll do it. I'll talk to you. All right. Thank you, Sarah. Okay. Would you do me a favor? Could you run this up your shirt and clip it right there? Sorry. Thanks. Okay, is that good? Yep. - All right, guys. - Quiet down, please. Okay. Um-- why don't we start with your name. Then we can go from there. Okay. Um... My name is Sarah hope. I was-- i-- I am the only li-- the only known survivor of heaven's veil. I have no idea why they didn't kill me too. Did your, um-- did your parents die there also? Uh, they must have. I don't know. I'm not-- I'm not sure who my parents were. I don't even know my real name. They named me-- they named me Sarah hope-- at the hospital. Uh... I was in foster care, a lot of different homes, till I was 16. I think this is me and my brother and my sister. But I'm not sure. I was only five. This is that really famous one, the one of Jim and his followers. I know this is really hard, but there is a reason why we... Reached out to you. Like I said earlier on the phone, we found something that no one's ever seen before. Do you see that camera right there? And right there? And right there. They were filming. But there's no record of anything. Nothing's ever been released. And there's this. They never found this room. Not in the farmhouse or any of the buildings. No one knows what happened that day. Why did they do it? I wanna go back out there and find those films. Maybe we'd find out what really happened. We're in this room. We feel the silence. There is a time for every season, mama. This child has been cut down before her time. How long? How long has your daughter been this way? Two years. Mmm. The doctors say she's brain-dead. Doctors. Doctors. The doctors don't want her well, mama. They like that money coming in. No, sir. The child's mind is not dead. Will you join hands with me? We need to create an opening, close the circuit so the girl can find her way back home. Please. Indulge me. Please. Thank you. There we go. All right. Now, mama, i want you to be brave. Something happened before the child got lost, about a week before. No. Mm-hmm. No. Nothing. Not to her, mama. Nothing. To you. To you. Something so terrible, it froze your heart, and you swore you'd never tell a living soul. But the spirit sees all. No! The spirit knows all. The spirit understands all. Now whisper it. Whisper it to me. Let it out. No. No. Let it out. Whisper. Whisper it in my ear! Give it to me! Tell me the truth. The truth! The real truth! Now! He's going down! Get his head. I got his feet. Grab him. Grab him. Hold him. I've got his head. Rotate him. Look out. So, how long have you guys worked together? - Just long enough to talk us into this. We actually met in film school, so we've done everything together-- industrials, um, web series-- - infomercials. - Once. We did one infomercial. "Your skin will practically glow." - That was the best payday we ever had. - Yeah, for three days of hell. Uh, excuse me. I'm pretty sure you slept with the spokesmodel. Hey, she was very smart. Oh! - She reads books. But this film? This is different. We've wanted to make this film for a long time. Why is it so important to you? Wait, you didn't tell her? Uh, our dad, he led the FBI team that day, the day when everyone, um-- died. Our dad was never really the same after that. Neither was our mom. So that's why you have all those photos. That's why we're here. Look at this guy. Mr. Wheeler, hi. Maggie, from the documentary. Uh-huh. Thank you so much for letting us shoot on your property. - I know this is-- - twenty-five years, i kept folk away from here. Who are all these folks? Thought it was just you. Oh, no, uh, this is my crew. - Christian, my brother, is the editor. - Hello, sir. Nick is our gaffer. Matt's our cameraman. Ed, grip. What's up? Jill does sound, and Ann is our pa. - And this is Sarah hope. - I know who she is. Thought it was you. Bound to come back home. Was wondering if you ever would. Oh, wow. You okay? Hey, hey. What? Get this. Okay. Get down. Get down. - Oh, shit. - Sarah! Sarah! - Sarah? - Is she okay? - What happened? Are you okay? - I'm okay. I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't be here. All right, we'll set up camp over there. Thanks. Can you imagine how weird this must be for her to be back here? She's the one that made it out. My whole life has been defined by this place, by what happened. It's the same for me. After it all happened, i, um-- I was only three at the time, but... my father, uh, killed himself. What? I found him hanging in the garage. I thought he was playing a game. We both lost our families because of this place. I need to know why. Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. Ed? Ed! Ed! Do you see him down there? - No, he's not over here. - Ed! Ed! Ed, stop messing around! Sarah, have you seen ed? He's gotta be around here someplace. He left all of his stuff. His wallet is right there. He couldn't have gone far. Ed, where the hell are you? Ed! Ed, breakfast is ready! Yeah, that should get him. Maggie! I'm gonna look up front. - Come take a look at this. - All right, what is it? I don't know. Um, just look here. Who moved the camera? Look right there. Look at that. We got a ghost. Wow. - Nick, it's not a ghost. - You don't believe in ghosts? And watch this part. That's where ed was sleeping. The Van's gone. It's gone. What do you mean it's gone? What? Let's have a look. Oh, what the fuck? This isn't like him. I know. He's a grumpy fucker, but he's not a quitter. We crawled through swamps with this guy. There's no way he'd bail on us. Looks like he did. What do we do now? - Has anybody got any bars? I'm trying, but I got nothing. - What do we do? Go back? - No. We have, like, 80 grand worth of equipment in there. - That's 80 grand we do not have. - Yeah, exactly. Well, someone's gotta go down for some help. Me? Yeah. You're the pa. You're gonna send me down there to walk 20 miles, probably till dark? Don't exaggerate. It's 16 miles. This one. Ann, it's okay. Nick will go. Oh, really? Yeah. Matt'll cover for you. You'll be down before dark. Yeah. Well, thanks, pal. Fine. No, wait. I'll come with you. Oh. I thought you didn't wanna go. It's better than staying up here with that creepy farmer guy out there. All right. What? - Be careful. - Yeah, I'll keep an eye out for inbred farmers. No, Nick, she needs to be careful of you. Oh! Ow, Maggie. Ow. Stop it. Let's set up the next interview by the church. You gonna need both cameras? Yeah. We need to go across the lake. Hmm? Across the lake? I remembered something. Are you seeing this? It's a strip that's shallow. Come on. Goes all the way across. Let's go. Sarah? Where are we going? To that place. And you think this is it? I remember it now. It was Jim's special place. Ugh. No lights. I hate rats. Not my favorite either. Oh, I have another one right here in my pack. It's, like-- it's inside, in, like, the flashlight pouch. Right there. Here they are. These are the films you were looking for. Whoa! Sarah, are you okay? Wha-- yeah. I think i fell through this chair. What do you mean, you fell through it? My hand went through the leather. Oh-- oh, my-- oh, my god! Come here, Sarah. Come here. Come here. Give me your hand. - Sarah. Sarah! Here we go. Fuck. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, Maggie, clearly nobody ever found this place. There's no way we would have found this place if it wasn't for her. What do you think? We're gonna need to get some lights on in there. It's actually in pretty good shape. If it's got fuel. Here we go. Careful. Let's check it out. - Oh! God! - God. Why don't you try another switch? Why don't you try another switch? Ugh. Here they are. We can watch 'em if I can get this to work. Look at this. What? Oh, wow. No, no, no! Don't touch that. I'm sorry. It's just that it's next to a body and it's probably evidence of some kind of crime, and if you touch it with all your hands-- whatever is on this tape-- should go to the police because it's evidence. We're not gonna take it to the police. M-maybe we should. - But n-not right away. - I don't really wanna argue next to a body. All right, we should-- it's entirely decomposed. Okay, if you wanna enable yourself into doing whatever you do. That's Karen sweetzer, the nurse that followed Jim. The one they never found. I got away. They-- they tried to get me. But I got away. When did she record this? Must be after the FBI raid. They're gonna-- they're gonna come get me. They wanna control me like I'm a puppet. They want in, but I'm not gonna let anybody in. Do you hear that, Jim? I will not let anybody in. I didn't come here to be taken. Even if they get in, they won't get me. Sarah. I want you to-- ch-- ch-- sh-she looked, like, um, drugged, you know. Yeah. She's so manic. I mean, so paranoid. What was she talking about? That the FBI was gonna use her like a puppet? She was so loyal to the end. I have become what never fails. And the dead shall be raised incorruptible. And we shall be changed. We need to watch the rest of those films. You got the whole thing in frame? Yeah, it looks great. It works. We just need a new bulb. Sure there's a kmart around. Oh, look at this. "Pancuronium bromide." It's for lethal injections. It halts the respiratory system. Your lungs stop working. You suffocate. Hey. Hey. Be careful with those. They don't have needle guards. Seriously? Why are you touching needles? Sorry. Don't touch-- don't touch anything. Sorry. I wasn't gonna touch the top. Jim's room. Seems about right. Ugh. Fuck station partridge family. Why don't we just go back down to the compound, wait for Nick and Ann, figure everything out there? How about we just look for the projector bulbs? Sorry. Projector bulb! Okay, I loaded up the earliest film. - All right. Rolling. - Here we go. All right, is it filming? Uh, yeah, I hear it. Well, when we get the new cameras we'll be able to check it right away. And how are they different? Uh, they're new video cameras. You can buy the tapes at the supermarket-- $24.99. You don't have to send it all in to Kodak and-- i-i-- - okay, Jim. - Whenever you're ready. This is film number one. I'm Jim Jacobs, and we are here at heaven's veil ranch. It's December 11, 1982. When we started here, there was just a few of us. Small group of seven. A family. There's a small town in Indiana. Whenever I think of it, a great deal of pain comes. As a child, i was undoubtedly one of the poor. Never accepted. Born, as it were, on the wrong side of the tracks. And when I was very small, I lost my father and my mother to an unholy fire, they tell me. I knew too early the pain of suffering, the pain of loss. But tragedy can beget transformation. I believe that mankind is on the cusp of a new reality, one that transcends pain, suffering, even death. I've discovered that the spiritual nature is attached to the human form at certain points, represented by the three nails of the crucifixion. And by three alchemical initiations, I can now draw these nails and permit the divine nature of man to come down from its cross. I can release the nails that pin the spirit to the body and free the soul from its mortal coil. Jim is in a meditative state. Once he reaches full trance, he will leave his body in the physical form and he'll manifest himself in spirit in this room. Father? Father, are you here? Father, if you are here, reach out to us. Reach out to us, Jim. - Jim? - I don't think he's breathing. - Jim, come back to us. Jim, come back to us. Focus. There you go. There you go. Slow, controlled. Okay. That's good. Mommy. Mommy. What happened? Sarah. Come here. Okay. Is he okay? Yeah, he's okay. What are you doing up? I was playing, mom. Okay, come. Time to go to bed. She was my mom. Karen sweetzer was-- so horrible. I mean-- ugh. So sad for her, and so gruesome. You know? I just think, deep down, maybe she was hoping her mom was still alive somewhere. Mom. I guess you were my mom. I am so sorry this happened to you. I feel like-- like something wanted me to come back here, to bring them here with me, but i-- something about it feels so wrong. Sarah! Sarah? Sarah! What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? Nothing happened. Nothing happened. - Help us! Help! - Matt! - Please! - Guys! We need help! - Do you hear that? - It's Nick. Help! - Maggie! - Maggie! Ann? Maggie! What is it? What? Ed. - Oh, god. - Oh, my god. Oh. He must have been doing 90. I guess he missed that curve. - Why was he going so fast? - Someone was in the car with him. No one was in the car with him. That doesn't make any sense. What are you talking about? Who was in the car with him? Go ahead. Tell her your theory. The other air bag blew. Look! It doesn't matter though. One blows, they both blow. That's how it works. Besides, who's gonna come up here? Someone hiked 16 miles to steal a shitty Van, and ed gives his life to stop 'em? Goddamn it, you guys. I can't believe this. Did you-- did you check him? I mean, he's for sure dead? Yeah. - Are you sure? - Feel free to check him again, Maggie. - Oh, god. - Shit. So we go to the cops, right? Yes. Yes, we go to the cops when we can. There's no way we can make it there by dawn. And that farmer's still out there. Seriously? Farmer John did not kill ed, okay? It's 12 miles down to the main road, and then it's another 20 miles to, like, the nearest anything. Do you guys wanna walk down in the dark, or-- what about ed? Oh, god. We'll leave in the morning. Yeah. Do you remember your mom at all? I can't remember. I did always feel like she wanted me back, for us to be a family again. Maybe it's just wishful thinking. I don't know, i-- I do feel like the answers are in that house. I do too. You wanna go back? I do. Maggie, I thought we just decided that we were leaving. We are. In the morning. We're gonna go back to the house and watch those films. Who's coming with? Christian, come on. Yeah, no, I was coming. I was totally coming. Anyone else? All right. I guess, uh, see you guys in the morning. Seriously? You guys aren't a little curious? No. Not really. Wait up. All right, well, I'm not babysitting. Nick, wait. Oh, come on. Hey, I know you guys are really tired, but i kinda need one more thing. - Can you grab some b-roll for me? - Now? Please. You are obsessed. Look, Maggie, how far are we gonna go with this? We lost our family because of this. So did she. So as far as we need to. Right? Okay. We good? Yeah. To be released and come back. Released and come back. This is the loop that we must close. I must journey to the other side, where I will extract the first nail, and then I must return through the golden door-- into my body. Karen is preparing the first injection. It's a little cocktail of my own making. There's some luminous ether in there, some bismuth-- sodium pentothal. Some Mercury. Yes, it's quite poisonous. Why did you create this drug, Jim? Um, I'm having trouble-- I'm having trouble conjugating. Re-conjugating. Re-conjugating? Do you hear that? Yeah. I can't see where it's coming from. It's not from the film. Could be from another room? Communicate with us. We're here for you. Push through, Jim. Push through. Come through to us. Push through, Jim. Push through. Hello, brothers and sisters. It's a beautiful day. Jim, is that you? The body is nothing but a shell. A cycle of physical ego for us to outgrow and discard as we please. The first nail is ours. Now what? I'm not staying in here. What do you think? I don't know. Oh, shit. Spark plug's fried. I don't even think they make this kind anymore. I think I saw some spark plugs in the pantry. Great. No, no, I'll go. Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Nick. Yeah, I'll say hi to Jim for ya. They look like this. Oh, like a spark plug? Yeah, thanks, Matt. Somebody here? Okay, if there's somebody here, show yourself. All right, look. We're not here to hurt you, okay? What do you want? Sarah. I said, what do you want? What's taking him so long? Hey, Maggie. If we can fix the generator, we're going home, right? Where's Sarah? - Sarah! - Sarah? Nick! Sarah? We don't have time for this. Nick, stop dicking around. Nick, come on. This isn't funny, man. - He went out to the gennie. - Jesus! Sarah, you scared the shit out of me. It just-- it just came back on. I didn't even touch it. Yeah, it was a breaker inside. I really don't wanna go back inside. It's just too-- too weird? Too creepy? Too scary? Nick! Stop. - I'm serious. - I know, I know. Come here. Uh, we should probably go-- let's use this one. Was that from march of '80? Yeah. Where the hell are Ann and Nick? Right here. Oh, hey. Can you please take these Mikes and put 'em in the other rooms? I wanna see what we can pick up. Sure. No problem. Great. Thanks. Turn 'em on. I just changed the batteries. You got it. To be released and come back-- I have refined the formula to take us further to the other side. The venom from the African black mamba is a potent neurotoxin. Mixed with pancuronium bromide, which is a lethal agent used to execute death row inmates. Just two drops will stop the heart in 60 seconds. After six minutes, brain death. Without an antidote, the death rate is 100%. This is the antidote. This will bring Jim back to us. Now, do not, under any circumstances, administer the antidote before the full six minutes. Set the timer, Sam. Long enough to dance with death, not so long as to marry her. He had an antidote. - Would that even work? - It could. If done in time. Jim? Jim, speak to us. Jim, speak to us. Oh, my god, Jim. I don't have a heartbeat, Karen. Oh, god. Jim, come on. - Give him the antidote now! - Use the antidote! Wait. He said to wait six minutes. - Don't wait! Do it now! - Jim, hang on, okay? You're so close. Jim! Jim. Jim. It's me. Karen. It's me. I thought we lost you. Karen. Oh, my-- my brothers, we have removed the second nail. I have been reborn. - I have been reborn. My brothers, sisters, i must confess. I'm not strong enough to go back there on my own. - Now we know. - Yeah, he's a fucking psycho. It wasn't suicide. - They had an antidote. - Why didn't they use it? Something must have gone wrong. They didn't plan to die. Yeah, they all thought that they were coming back. Jesus, this is such a load of shit. Let's see if there's anything on the Mikes. This is from the living room Mike. Oh, my-- my brothers, we have removed the second nail. I have been reborn. I've been reborn. This is track two, dining room. Three, hallway. Four, camera room. Guys, what the fuck was that? It's haunted! This place is haunted! Enough is enough, Maggie. Let's get the fuck out of here. We will, I promise. But we just-- but what, Maggie? Let's just load up our shit and go. Why are we still talking about this? - But we're so close. - Close? Close to what, Maggie? We can't leave. What do you think we should do? You begged me to come here. I didn't want to. You said that we would find answers. Well, now I have actually seen my family. You can leave. You can all leave, but I am staying until I find out why i was the one who survived. - Jill, please. - Maggie, I love you. I do. I just-- you can keep all my sound stuff. I ju-- you know what? When I get down, I'll call for some help. Um, you guys are good with the cameras? - Matt? - Somebody's gotta go with her, Maggie. Shit. Let's digitize the rest of the films, and we'll leave at sunrise. Okay. Okay, I just need to get this on camera. Have you heard those voices before? Why didn't you tell us, Sarah? Would you have believed me? What do you wanna do? I think we should talk to them. Okay. Mom. Can you speak to us? I know you're here. I'm here. I'm here. So talk to me. You wanted me. Here I am. Bring them to us. I've tried. Sarah. I need you. As soon as I get home, I'm gonna give my rsum to the game show network. You know Maggie. She's not coming down till she gets exactly what she wants. Girl's like a dog with a bone. Shit! Jill? Jill? Hey, wait, wait! Jill! Where did he go? Ed? Where did he go? Oh, my god. Oh, god. Matt? Yeah? I think maybe-- oh, my god! Ed! Shit! Oh, my gosh! He's gushing blood from his neck. You gotta hold-- hold the wound right there. I'm gonna go get something out of my bag. Put your hand here and hold tight, okay? It's okay, ed. It's okay. - Hold it tight, Matt! - You're gonna be okay, buddy. - Hurry the fuck up! - I got it, I got it. Okay. We're gonna switch. - One, two, three, go. I thought he was dead. Sarah checked him, right? Look, all that matters is that we need to get help. I need you to go and get the paramedics. I can handle this. All right? Okay. Go! Okay! Okay. I need you to hold this, okay? Can you put your hand there? Just gonna get something to tie it off, okay? - I'll be back. Okay. Hang on, ed. One second. Okay. I'm coming. I'm coming back, all right? Shit. Help! Stop! Help! Please! Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Where are you? I came back. Like you asked me to. Here I am. Sarah! Sarah! Fuck! Christian. Christian? Christian, why didn't you answer me? You gotta see this. Jesus was nailed to the cross. He wasn't bound. He was nailed. The spirit is not bound to the body. It is nailed. Thank you, my darling. It won't give up its fleshy domain easily. But if we release the nails, we forge a new reality. A deathless world, a new dawn for mankind. But, Jim, certainly, the children don't-- you know, Karen, in German, the word for "death" is heimgehen. It means "going home." What better place for the children than at home? The task that we have set before us is one of the most challenging that any group of human beings has ever had to face. It is a task which requires a perfect faith. Devotion? No. A lifetime of devotion is not enough. One must have direct experience of the power of spirit. Isn't it curious? The same tool we use to pound the nails in, we also use to draw the nails out. How funny. I release the spirit within! I release the god inside! I give birth to the spirit, and birth is bloody, and birth is painful, and there is blood, and there is pain, and you are born into everlasting life! Stop, Jim! Stop it. Sto-- back! Get back, I say! Rise up with your spirit and feel pain no more. And be released into eternity! Arise! Arise. Yes. Arise. Yes! The third nail's ours. Ours for the taking! And immortality is yours, brother. Forever. Yes. Will you follow me? Holy fucking shit. He's not a fake. - He could really-- - you said we came all this way for answers. Shouldn't we finish? Time has come to extract the last ethereal nail. Time will mean nothing to us. We'll watch galaxies spin like pinwheels. Sam. Set the timer to six minutes. Just a spoonful of sugar, children. Now we will all journey to the other side. I will be your guide. And since I cannot bring you all back at once, we will use the antidote that brought me back my first time. And when we return to our bodies, we will have a power without measure, as you witnessed within me. And we will use this power wisely to release every soul from its mortal coil. Sam. Without death in our lives, there's no need for fear. Children. No! No. Give me the cubes. Give them to me. Don't put them in your mouth. Don't eat them. Sister. Sister. Be calm, sister. Tormented and frightened is your soul. Please don't do this to our children, Jim. You're their father. Jim's your dad. Should we abandon our path? No! No. How many times must I die for you, Karen? Please, Jim, I'm scared. Matthew said, "and fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul." Jim. No, Jim, no! Jim! Kids, don't eat them. No, Jim! Children, I love you. Now, do as I say. No! Kids, don't do it. Kids, don't eat them. Jim, stop. No, kids, don't eat them. Sam, get the antidote ready! - No! - Silence! Sam! Continue, children. Jim, no! No! We don't have to do this! - Return! Now, mama, please. Mama, please, please don't do this. Don't do this. There's nothing to death. It's just a crossing over to another plane. Please, mama, please. We shall all rise up, and we will rub the dust of a thousand years from our eyes. Sarah, come on. Jim! She's getting away! Sarah, run and hide! Run! Hide! Jim! Those who will not follow shall be carried. Stop! Stop! No! This is my body. This is my blood. No! Shh. She is the flame of life, the power of darkness. Let her go. Sarah! Sarah! Brothers, sisters. ...and fear not them which kill the body-- ...shocked to realize-- supreme desire, supreme deity. Supreme change. There is no joy without suffering. Be ready with the antidote, Sam. What is it that we bury in the tomb of the-- Sam, the children, the children. Please. The antidote. Do it now. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Come on. Stay away from the children! - I'm not killing her! No! No, Sam! The children! Sam! No, Sam, please! - Please. Get away from the children! Put your hands behind your head! You'll rise. You'll rise again. Please. Rise, children! Get up and put your hands behind your head, now! Your hands where we can see 'em! What have you done? What have you done, sir? You think you bar the way? You only inflame my wrath! Your children! Your children's children will be subsumed! You all will be subsumed! No one will escape my wrath! You all! The FBI agent-- that was my dad. He was the one that-- who let all those people die. All of them. I mean-- none of them-- no. They wouldn't have. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I wanna be with you. Wait for me. They've been here, waiting for me to come back. They need you, all of you. They have to. What the fuck are you talking about? New vessels to continue on in... In eternity. Maggie, like Jim said-- there is no joy without suffering. Brother, sister, the sins of the father now laid upon the children. I don't know what's happening here, but we're gonna get out of here. - Let's go, Christian. - Christian's gone, Maggie. It's time for you to join us. - Christian? - It's amazing, Maggie. You'll see. After all, who wouldn't want everlasting life? Aaah! Get the fuck off me! No! Please, no! It wasn't his fault! He didn't know! I didn't know. Why is this happening? Why? Release the body-- that pins the spirit, that frees the soul from its mortal coil. My will be done. Ed? Jill? Maggie! Don't worry. They're not dead. He's gonna bring them back. No. No. You okay? Mr. Williams, you all right? Yeah. Yeah. The veil has been lifted, and the fallen shall rise. Children of the void, sons of chaos, it is the last hour. The hebdomad is complete. We have been remade by yaldabaoth in the image of the seven archons who created and enslaved this world. We are the hidden masters. We are the architects of anarchy. We are the dark fucking soul eaters, lords of the unrighteous. Today our new reign begins in a new reality! I told you! I told you! I told you we'd be deathless! We just, uh, need new shells from time to time and plenty of souls to eat. Our legion will rise from behind the veil to reap the pain that we have wrought! The seven shall become a vast multitude. These are the days of vengeance and wrath! The deathless eon has begun! It's a beautiful day.
