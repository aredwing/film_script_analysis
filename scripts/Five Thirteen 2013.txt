He wants to talk to you. Yeah, I have a really good idea. You do? Yeah. Great. Then we have no problem, Billy. No, we don't have a problem. I'll be hearing from you later. Yes, you will. Speak to you later. Is that all? Yeah. - Thank you. - He's waiting. (phone ringing) recording: The number you have reached is not in service at this- So I called three times and there's no answer. Nothing? So try again. So you gonna tell me what's going on? We've been waiting here. We're waiting for Pablo and Glen. Hey, they're supposed to be here. - Where's Pablo? - I don't know, he's not here. I trust Glen, you don't trust Pablo? Maybe we should just stay put until they get back, don't you think? This is where we said we were gonna meet. I can tell you we got a bag of cash here, we got another bag coming. Sit tight and don't get nervous. This is not gonna work. I mean, what if they got caught by the police or something? Like.. I gotta get out of here. We've all gotta get out of here. Let's give them 30 more minutes. He's not here in 30 minutes, we take our cut, what's left of it, and we get the fuck out. But you're making-- You're beginning to make me nervous. And we gotta stay cool right now, man. Pablo: Yo. Jesus fucking Christ, where the fuck have you two been? Where the fuck you think, man? Cops every-fucking-where, man, we had to take a detour. Yeah, man, it was a landslide or earthquake some shit and traffic is bad, cops trying to kill us, and all kinds of shit. Oh, that is fucking beautiful. - A hard day's work, baby. - Yeah. It's all fucked up. Yes, sir-- yes, sir. - Not bad, right? - There it is, it's green and it spins, and it's good. Right? Where's the fucking money, huh? Glen: What? What are you talking about? Where's the fucking money-- That's not it. Glen: This bitch is talking to me? "Is this bitch talking to me?" Mike: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... What is this? What's this, what's this? What are you talking about man? - Money. - Where's the rest of it? What's wrong with you? Mike: Go ahead, look at the bag and look at this bag. I mean, where's the rest of the money? You guys stash it? I don't wanna look at shit, man, I don't want to look at you either. What is wrong-- Who is this motherfucker? Why'd you bring him over here? Mike, it's good, it's all there. All right? - No, I'm not stupid, all right. - Everybody be cool. Nobody's calling you stupid, man. Look at how light this bag is, and look how heavy mine-- If it's green and it spins, then it's good, and the rest of it is in your fuckin' ass, I guess. Mike: What the fuck is this-- You think I'm some-- - Shut the fuck up! - You shut the fuck up! Where the fuck is the rest of the money at? Mike, relax, man. Trust me, relax. Shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down. I'll kill you, you motherfucker. - Yo Mike, man, it's cool. - Pablo, shut the fuck up, I'll shoot you! Shut the fuck up and sit down! Where's the fucking money, huh? You did take it, didn't you? Whoa, hey, baby, baby, calm-- Baby, calm down! You did take it! (everyone shouting) This is not it-- Where's the fucking money? - You got-- - Where's the fucking money? - You did take it! - Put the gun down! You did, didn't you? - Where's the money? - I'll kill you by looking at you, bitch! I'll kill looking at you! Get your bitch man. Put your gun down, I'll kill by looking at you. I'll look at you and kill you. I'm a killer! I kill people. You pull a gun on me, you god damn whore? Are you out of your fuckin' mind? Look, man, I just want my fucking money! Calm the fuck down! We gonna split this shit up, we gonna get the fuck out of here, all right? Good idea he's got. Let's cut the money up and let's go. Okay, come on, let's get paid, all right? Y'all ready to get paid? Let's get the fuck out of here. - We got it, we did it. - Let's go. Yeah, let's go. Let's go. Motherfucker! (cackling) What the fuck are you doing, man? Oh, my gosh, I just killed three people. (laughil19) Fucking asshole. (thumping) I couldn't kill her looking at her, but I had to shoot her. Some things never change. You know what I like, Pablo? I like winning. I like pussy. I like beer, too. I like you. Now, listen to me. I like you right now. But just right now. Let's keep it that way, okay? Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah.

Let's keep it that way-- Let's keep it that way. I like you, Pablo, I like you. Keep it that way-- Grab this bag, and let's go. Shit! (gun fires) Hey, Pablo. "Shit" is the second most common people say right before they're killed. "Fuck," being number one, dumb spic. (creaking) IJ" (rustling) (metallic clattering) Yeah, done deal. IJ" (banging) (inaudible) officer: Get down, get down! (guns firing, sirens blaring) Hold up, hold up! Yo, be easy, yo, be easy, man! No, no, not the car! (shouting, gun firing) Fuck! Yo, Stick, the kidneys, man! Damn! (phone ringing) Yeah, it's me. Yo, where the fuck are you guys, man? (clears throat) Look, we-we got a problem. - The kidneys. - What? We got carjacked. What the fuck you mean you got carjacked? We got robbed for the car. The kidneys are in the car. Come on, man! Do you know we got robbed earlier today, motherfucker? Do you know that? You know, you put me in an awkward position, man. Do you know who this is we're talking about? So how are you gonna fuck this up? - we - Shut up, listen. You find those fucking kidneys, man. You find them shits like they was yours. Y'all a couple of fuck-ups, you know that? What did he say? What you think he said? We fucked. (crying) Just please tell me what happened. Huh? What happened? I am okay with robbing a bank, but not murdering people. - Okay, look, um... - Who are you? Sshh, I'm your husband and I love you and you need to go back there right now. Listen, Renee, you need to go-- You got five minutes. Get whatever matters to you the most, because we're going somewhere, okay? We're leaving on a jet plane, okay, honey? - What about those people? - What? - What about those people? - They're dead, let's go. They're dead. Forget about them-- We're all gonna die. - Look, look, look-- - This is not funny! I know it's not, I'm sorry. Get ready, we gotta go. We gotta go. We're going somewhere beautiful, you're gonna love it there. Hey, Renee? Honey? Come here, honey. Let's have a... (clinking) A toast to the nouveau riche. (banging, clattering) Renee? IJ" (clicking) Renee, come over here to me. I'm gonna make you feel better, I promise. (crying) Hey, stop crying, we gotta go. We gotta go, let's get out of this house. I'm scared. We gotta get out of the house. Come on. Let's get out of here, it feels creepy here, I don't-- (gun cocking) Walter: No sudden movements. - Hey... ' The gun! - Slowly! - Okay, Hey, just don't hurt my wife. Stay! Don't hurt my wife, all right? Be cool. Oh, I know you, you're the bank manager. Don't.. Don't do nothing, okay. 'Cause you're gonna believe what I'm gonna I tell you. I got $4 million right now. I got it. I got $4 million, loose. $4 million large, man, I can give it to you right now. You just let my wife go. I'm not bullshiting you, man, I got the money. Come on, let her go. Come on, we're men, she's a woman. Let her go, we'll work it out. You're gonna hurt that woman? She's a woman, for God's sakes. You don't want the money? You don't want the money. You must want to kill me, then. 'Cause if you don't kill me, motherfucker, I'm about to come over there and take the gun away from you and put it in your asshole and blow your fucking brains out top of your skull. You don't think I'm gonna? I'm gonna... Okay? I'm gonna, now let my wife go. She ain't done nothing to nobody ever in her life. Now let her go. You want the 4 million? You don't want the 4 million, you want to kill me then. Then go ahead and kill me. Now listen. I killed a whole bunch of motherfuckers myself. Wasn't shit to it, you know? 'Cause I'm a natural-born, motherfucking, goddamn, fucking killer. You're a natural born punk-ass bitch. You got a dick? Let me see it-- I don't believe you got one. What am I doing here? I see a gun, you're supposed to pull the trigger, punk! Now kill me! Kill me! What am I still doing here, Renee? What am I doing here alive? Huh? You punk ass mother-- (gun fires) What took you so long? Come on. (siren blaring) Tre: Look, the reason why I called you guys is because I'm ready to relocate. I need those new IDs for myself, Sticky, my brother, and my girl. Got a nice job working for us, so nice, I-- I'd like to see us work together a little longer. How do you feel about that? There's no more job for me. I'm trying to start over. Okay, well, Jack. What do you think? Should we stand up and just let him go? Or should we talk him about the job? What do we do here? What do I think? What do I think... I think it's pretty fucked up when you work for someone for two years and you turn around for a career change and don't even fucking tell you. What's he talking about? - What are you talking about? - What am I talking about? I tell you what the fuck I'm talking about. Two years we let you fly, here and there, running and gunning. Carrying money, back and forth. All we want is to know who, what, when, where, why and how. Stay out of the way. But you start transporting body parts? Okay-- Kidneys. This is.. See, this is where this is your responsibility. Legally, you sent me out there. You knew about the kidneys, I didn't know anything about any kidneys. So that's you guys-- That's your responsibility. Not mine. Okay, okay. What do you know about a Sheriff O'Connor? I saw a video, patrol car video. Where Sheriff O'Connor was shot in the head. By a Mr. Sticky-- Friend of yours? And you were standing right next to him. Did you hear about that? Not only I heard about it, I saw it and you looked fucking great on camera, standing there with your hands in the air, Sheriff O'Connol's brain on the side of your face. It's a back shot too. Great cameo. Great angle for jail. Know anything about that? IJ" Don't waste my time. Don't waste my time. (phone ringing) Fuck you. Fuck you, too-- I work harder than both of you. (keyboard clacking) IJ" Well, y'all know the kidneys-- You know the car got stolen. Look, can I just say this, okay? These guys, they will kill me, okay? They'll kill me and they'll kill my whole family. Man: Well, you're fortunate, cause you have three choices. Two of which suck. One... You go to jail for life. Two, you can burn. And third, is what Chuck's offering you, which is a free hall pass. The good news is, we know exactly where the bathroom is. That car had GPS tracking system. 3555 Johnson. It's very simple. What you need to do is go to 3555 Johnson. Get in the fuckin' car, and drive the kidneys to where they belong. And you're done. So let me get this straight. We go, pick up the kidneys, deliver... And we walk. Right? Okay, you do the job. You don't shoot anybody else. You don't fuck up. You don't get anybody else involved. And you, your girlfriend, and your brother. We set you up. Another place, another identity. 'Kay, but what about Stick? Sticky shot a cop. That's the death sentence in this state. Stick's gonna burn. Worry about yourself. See, y'all Pl3Yil19- Man, somebody playing games. That's called a sticky situation. Tre: Look, y-you yourself. You let me-- You know Sticky rides with me, you know that. I brought him into this thing. You did what you said you were gonna do. I'll push, and he just gets life. I can't guarantee that, but you got my word. Which seems a little better than your word. So now you tell me. Are you gonna do this for us? IJ" Leave us alone. Five-thirteen. You know what that is? No. 5-1-3. It's a code. You never heard of that before? Between you and me. I don't really give a fuck that you and that bald-headed bastard killed that sheriff. What I really care about is Henry Martinez. Do you know who he is? Yeah. He's a money launderer. Controls most of the west coast through private banks. His tentacles reach out from Moscow to Rome. He's power crazed. He wants to control the east coast as well, especially Miami. Have you ever heard of Ernesto Esteban? French Cognac. The best one. He's a Cuban, druglord monster who controls Miami. In order for Martinez to even think about Miami, he has to get Esteban's blessings. Unfortunately, Mr. Esteban's insides are rotting. He needs a kidney. Martinez arranged through his Mexican connections to get him a kidney. The same kidney that you let slip through your fucking hands. Now, don't ask me why. But I cannot nail Martinez unless Esteban gets that kidney. So I need you to find that kidney and get it to Esteban. Do you understand? Yeah. Good. Find it. (music playing) man: It's taking him forever just to roll a blunt. Man: I've been rolling blunts since you was in diapers, both of y'all. That shit right there, though? That's that fire. Shit! Get over here! (helicopter passing overhead) You crazy, "i993? I don't like that at all-- whew. IJ" Stick: Get the fuck down! Man: What the fuck? (shattering) IJ" (music playing) Yo, it's me. Yeah, we got the kidneys. Nestor: You got them? All right. I'll meet you at the spot in 30 minutes. So let's drop this shit off and we out. (siren blaring) Tre: Yo. That paper, baby. Nestor. Another job well done. We, like, in a rush, too. Man: Boys. Yo! yo! Yo, what's up man? Nestor, what's up man? Stick: Nestor, what's up man? What you doing, man? Henry wants you to take the kidneys to him at which point he's gonna pay you, but I told him I had to talk to you first. So I just got a few questions for you. First thing first. Oh, Nestor. Let me ask you. Did you know he's a snitch? What... Come on. Did you know he's a snitch? I've known him my whole life, man. He ain't a cop, Nestor, come on. An informant for the police. - Tre: Snitch? - A stool pigeon. What's he talking about? What are you talking about? What am I talking about? Your boy is a cop, man. Tre: You're joking, right? Fucking tattletale! First of all, let's dispense with all the bullshit. You know howl know that you're an informant? It's because I... work for the DEA. I'm a DEA agent, motherfucker. But you knew that-- Did you know that? No. That's howl know you're a fucking snitch. That's howl know. I believe you when you say you didn't know. That's fucked up, right? Your boy's a snitch. Yeah, I looked up your file. Sticky: What? Yeah, nigga. What? What the fuck is that, Tre? I don't know. He's a cop, that's what the fuck I'm talking about. I'm not a cop! Tre, what the fuck's he talking about, man? Yo... Now, you mad, huh? You damn right I'm mad. Nestor: Now you mad, nigga? Tre, what the fuck's he talking about? Tre: Let me handle this. What you mean be quiet? Yeah, don't let this nigga tell you to be quiet. That's fucked up. We brought the kidneys. "We brought the kidneys." Look, nigga, don't-- Look, I know you're a cop, I'm a cop too, I'm DEA. So let's dispense with the bullshit. You're gonna fucking make me lose my temper. Seriously, you're gonna end up fucking around and rub me the wrong way, man. I'm about two seconds off your ass, motherfucker. You know? Sometimes you gotta tell the truth, nigga, that's life, all right? Hey, go get that thing. Go get that thing we were talking about earlier. Yo, Mike! Nestor: Fall back, fall back. Fall back, motherfucker! Tre: Mike, you all right? I'm all right. Tre: What are you doing, man? Listen-listen to me, listen to me. Listen to me-- First of all... First of all, listen to me. Listen to me. First of all. I ain't shoot this motherfucker. We had nothing to do with that. This wannabe Jesse James-ass nigga robbed a bank and got shot in the process. We actually keeping this motherfucker alive, man. Tre: What? You should be thanking my ass. Tre: Mike. Here's the fucked up thing, though. Here's the fucked up thing. Here's the part that's fucked up. He robbed one of Henry's banks. Yeah, this stupid motherfucker robbed one of Henry's banks. - Tre: Look... - I didn't know. No, you look, motherfucker! You know what kind of position that puts me in, man? You're fucking with my livelihood at this point. Look, all I want to do is make extra paper on the side, man, it's a bad economy. And you fucking with that. You're fucking with that. You've been slipping for a minute. Now you expect me to believe you want to take one last trip and your brother robs one of Henry's banks? You put me in a fucking awkward position. You understand? You put me in an awkward position. And it's making me very angry right now. Nestor-- Let me just talk to Henry. Let them go, and let me go talk to Henry. Don't try to be noble now, motherfucker, you fucked up. You, stop grilling me like that. I'm serious, stop grilling me like that, motherfucker. Listen. One more question for you. And this shit that I'm about to ask you right now is-- This is probably the most important answer you ever give in your life, my dude. Seriously. I'm being straight up with you. What do you know about 5-13? Tre: Help me. (everyone shouting) (sirens approaching) Freeze! No-- No! Damn, Tre! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on, this way! - Go, get out of here. - No, I'm gonna stick with you. Look, I'm working for the cops. You understand? You gotta go. You gotta go, Stick! Let's go. IJ" Wait, wait... Wait, wait. We gotta keep moving. Dude, we gotta go. I need a break. Tre: Come on man. Come on, give me two minutes, man. (sirens approaching) Stay right here. I'm gonna get us out of here. Don't move. 0K3)!- Yo! What are you doing? I told you I got your back. I told you to get out of here. I told you I got your back, let's go. I'm not leaving you and Mike here by yourself. We gotta move. Stick! (groaning) I 9011 your."... your back. I know, bro. Mike: Tre. Tre... We gotta go. Tre, he's dead, we gotta go! I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry. (engine purring) So how you gonna do now? I mean, they bandaged me up. I mean... nothing but a flesh wound. I should be all right. You know when I first got out of jail? I kinda felt like there was nobody there for me. I felt like my daughter didn't even know who her father was. I kinda felt the same way about you, too. Nah. When you were locked up, I was locked up. I felt like I was in prison every day. I couldn't stand to see you in there. You didn't do anything. You know? That hurt me the most. We blood. We blood... And that's that. Always have your back, I'll be here for you, even when I'm not around. Tre. Thank you. For what? Everythil- Thank you for everything. That's what I'm here for, bro. Look, uh... Do me a favor. Sit tight, alright. I don't want you to move too much. I'm going to run in the crib and pick up something. See, all this time, I've been working and putting together some money. I got enough for us to start over. I got enough. It's gonna be all right. Today is the beginning. IJ" IJ" (gun firing) (no audio) (gun firing) (siren approaching) (tires screeching) (crashing) Shit. (gun firing) Tre: No! No! HIRE] What did you do? See what you did? HIRE] Officer: Police, get on the ground! - Officer: Get down on the ground! - Get on the ground now! NOW! Tre: You gonna be all right, bro. No, Mike. I gotta take care of you, bro. You can't go! Just fight it, fight it, bro! Fight it! I need an ambulance! I need an ambulance! Come on, bro. I'm supposed to take care of you. Oh, God. Oh, come on, bro. Look at me, look at me! No! Wake up! IJ" IJ" Tre: I still never really figured out what they meant by the code 5-1-3. For what I understand or believe it to be, it's the name the Feds used when dealing with this operation. When I looked it up, it read: "When a bullet comes out the barrel of a gun, it comes out at 513 degrees Fahrenheit." I found it to be ironic. That they arrested my brother on 5/13. Looking back, I never questioned how or why the feds were putting so much pressure on me to help them. They held my brother over my head like a dangling carrot, knowing that my brother was innocent. After a four-and-a-half year full-on investigation, the district attorney's office dropped all charges against my brother. A matter of which I knew nothing about. And so the trap was laid. I would sign the deal that would ultimately cause bullets to fly and lives to be lost. The day my brother walked into that store, the bait was set and 5-13 was born. Lisa, the girl who shot my brother... Just a civilian touched by the air of confusion. Me, I thought I was smarter that everyone. I didn't realize that I was, in fact, the metaphor of the dog who ran in circles chasing his tail only to be stopped by his own fatigue. And when I open my eyes, I saw a pregnant girlfriend. I figured out something, though. You have to be careful of the deals you sign, because it's true what they say. What comes around goes around. IJ"
