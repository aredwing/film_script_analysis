Mister Semaca, believe me, I didn't betray you! I was brought here by force. Please, believe me, mister Semaca! Now! -Don't move! You're under arrest! -Don't shoot! Hands up! You got here just in time, inspector. Inspector, allow me to explain... Take him! Miclovan! What happened, my boy? It's bad? It's nothing... They got me. -Why did you come here? -I relied on your instinct. Too bad you stayed right in front of him... Miclovan! I didn't know it hurts so bad... THE LAST BULLE December 1945 BUCHARES In the name of the law, this court decides to discharge the accusations against the accused Semaca Constantin and to set him free. What can I say? It was a dreadful night. I was just inspecting one of my storehouses and I found myself in the middle of a battle between the mob and the late Miclovan. If it wasn't for inspector Roman who saved my life... How can I ever thank you? I though everything was in order. Well, I'm sorry. It's such a waste... However, if you want to furnish your home in a proper way, please contact me. Sir... He was magnificent, wasn't he? -Who is he? -The police officer who arrested him What a face... Hello, inspector! If you don't mind, I... What do you want? Leave me the hell alone! You were right, Tudor... Just have a little more patience. Now, forgive for saying that, you have all the time in the world. We have all the streets in this secto under control. Roman speaking. What? Where? We're on our way. Everybody to the marshalling yard. Be armed! -Mister Roman! -What do you want? Come on! -What's happening here? -There are 10-15 mobsters with guns. They wounded two civilians and a police officer on line 7. -What's up there? -A train with food for Moldavia. Be careful, inspector! Listen to me! Throw down your guns and surrender! You're surrounded! Why are you starring at me? You piece of shit! -How many are there? -Around 25. -Civilians? -Yes. Take off you hats, we might shoot each other. You go ahead and pin the down there! Wait! Four on one side, four on the other. -The rest of you, on the lorry! -Right away, boss! The plan is simple. We split in two. One group attacks this way, the other that way. We catch the train in the middle. Give me a machine-gun. Nobody shoots without warning. Let's go! Stop! Hands up! Don't shoot! Handcuff him! -Shoot, God damn it! -Boss, look what I found. You're so smart! Take this balls here... I want to see fireworks as if it were the National Day. Here, boss! -Put away your gun and get out! -Please, don't shoot! -Please! -Move! -Don't shoot! Please! -Move! You shoot on sight, without warning. We have wounded. OK. We wait until morning, but we'll take'em. -Inspector Roman... -What? An officer from the High Command is asking what's going on here. -Tell him to mind his own business! -Very good, sir. -Good evening! -What are you doing here? -I'm looking for inspector Roman. -Get out of here! -I looked for him at the station. -I told you to leave! -I have something to say to him. -Didn't you hear me? Leave! OK... Go! Go! Hurry up! Hurry up! Stop the engine! How do you do, mister Roman. It's me again. I was looking for you at the police station. Shut up! What are we going to do with them? God damn you! You're stealing the food and the clothes from the poor! I'll show you! Mr. Roman, you had a meeting at the prefect's office, at 8, remember? Arrest them! -What do you want? -A statement, if you please... Get away from me! I don't have time for statements. -Mihai, tell me what happened. -We'll talk later, at the station. Fine. Later! Stop! Disperse! Everybody, go home! -Inspector... -Shut up! Disperse! -Go home! -It's a misunderstanding. -Give me the paper. -It's possible. Move it! Leave or we'll shoot! Faster! This meeting is legal. We have the permit from... Get back or I'll shoot! The signal... Floor it and hit them! -Boss, this thing wasn't kosher. -How so? Oantza and Barbucel! Stay here and burn it all! Turn everything to ashes! Come on! -Right away, boss! -Come on now! Move! Get in! Hurry up! Are you crazy? It's a pity, don't you think? It's worth billions. Fifty-fifty... Wait, I'll park the car and then you can burn it. That's it! Go! A place for rest, a place where all the pain and the tears have gone. All the mistakes he made in his life like anyone of us... Boss, don't worry. We took care of everything. Take off your hat. Even if it was for a billion, one wouldn't take such precautions. And, when you think about it, everything for nothing. I didn't hear you... What did you say? For nothing? God bless you, boss! Please, forgive me... -Now... Please, excuse me... -Go on. -Excuse me for being so bold... -Please, do. You deserve it. Boss, please, forgive me, but now we're into politics. And right into Roman's sector. We hit this Bolshevik where it hurts the most. He will not rest until he sees all of us dead. And, with all due respect, he knows his business. He learned to shoot well, like the other one, Miclovan. Very good comparison, Banica... Comparison is reason. Like Miclovan or like this one. -What did you say? -It was in Latin. -I thought so... -Do you know a guy from Braila? -Floaca, known as Stampa? -Right. Boss, forgive me, but you hurt our feelings! Don't you think one of us is capable of blowing out his candle? We need someone who doesn't know Roman is a police officer. This is it. It's not our business. I don't believe it. Nothing at all? Not even a clue... But it was obvious they weren't police. Mihai, this time it's imperious, no matter what. You understand? They have to be caught! Right in your neighborhood, your comrades from the place you worked... -This makes me think that... -What? Nothing. I know what you were going to say. You have on obsession for Semaca! -You can't see anybody else! -Even in my dreams... Yes, it's me. No, not now. Semaca or not, those who committed this crime must be apprehended! It's a task from the Party. It's your responsibility. Do you really think you had to remind me? I'll get them. I'll get them even if it'll cost me my life! No! Let those who did this pay with their life! Yes, you heard me. -Bravo! You're a big boy now! -Don't speak to me like this! Excuse me! I wasn't thinking. Hi! Floaca, briefly... You'll receive 50 grands. You take'em out and leave. It's confidential. It's not a business thing, just an ambition. Nobody knows but you. He took one of my whores. You know I have a certain sensitivity in such matters. I know, boss... This is the guy. Well, well! I can't remember where I saw this guy... I don't know, but his "phyxiognomy" seems familiar. -Who are you working with? -How so? The Floaca brothers are always together. Look there. -When? -This night. Mister, do you want a Christmas carol? -Fine. -Come here! -Give me that file. -Here. This one's free. I saw him once on Lipscani Street. He fought in the war for a year. -I'm keeping my opinion... -Hello! Yes. It's for you, inspector. He's Lica, I'm sure. Yes, it's me! What? Right now? Fine, I'm coming. It's something wrong? No, nothing. It's personal. Well, guys, I think it's enough for today. We'll see each other tomorrow. Hello! Is anyone here? What do you want? -Don't do anything foolish... -Hands up! Throw away your gun! -You called me? -Shut up! Cut him. The building is surrounded by police vehicles. Be smart, you got no chance of escaping. -He's a cop. -He lies! Search him! I have my papers on me. Run! Stop! Mister Roman! -Forgive me... -What do you want? Who are you? Mr. Roman, I am... You have a familiar face, but I don't know where to place it. You don't recognize me... I joined the Communist Party. Look... And? -Here! -What's this? Just a little gift, so you'll help me No, take it. From where I take it, nobody can tell... To Fane, when he was in prison, I would bring from the same place. Fane, my brother, who had the honor of doing time with you. He was known as Oarca, may God rest his soul! -He stole because he was poor. -Oarca? Why didn't you say so? I kept trying to tell you, but you move so fast. Now here, tomorrow there. I heard they made you a minister. A smaller minister. You have any problems? -He beats me. -Who? The master. He beats me senseless, Mr. Roman, ever since he found out I joined the Communist Party. Why beat me? God damn him! Why would he do that? I'm only human! How can I sleep at night, with my wife, if he beats me all day long? I'm so upset and shamed that I don't feel like doing anything. -Listen... -My name is llie. OK, llie... And what do you want? I came here to ask you... If I kill him... 'Cause I can't stand it anymore and I will kill him. I'll be punished if I'm a Party member? -You will be punished... -But him? He has so many guns, you could arm an regiment, he will be punished? This is something else... Come, let's go, you'll make a statement. -I'm done, Mr. Roman. -Read it! Statement. Me, the underlined llie Oarca... -Undersigned! -I knew it was something wrong. Working at the farm of Mr. Semaca... -Semaca, did you say? -Yes. I'm working at Semaca's farm, in Craciunesti. He has arms on his domain? That's what I've been trying to tell you! Lonescu, get me a search warrant. You three go with me. The others are free! Hello! Please, give me the prosecutor's office. -What do you want? -Good evening. -We're looking for Mr. Semaca. -I am he. Yes, inspector. I am Jean Semaca. You know my brother very well. You saved his life. What can I do for you? This is the search warrant from the prosecutor. We have information you have an arms depot here, on the premises. What arms are you talking about, inspector? You're talking about hunting guns, maybe. That's right, I have a Peardey and a Holland-Holland. You'll be surprised, but I have a guns permit. Where is it? It's no need, I trust you. Who said that to you? This moron? Mr. Semaca, if you don't mind, I'd like you to come with me outside, for five minutes. You alone. This way. -In the Christmas Eve... -What is it? I have no idea. But Jean will manage, it's nothing serious. This way, Mr. Roman. Stay there! He's vicious, he kicks you. Moron, you said? What's this? Weird hunting guns... Mihai, where were you? We're waiting here for four hours. I want to confession, I have every right, don't I? We recognized three of the guys who passed themselves as cops. -In the car with the fender bender... -They are at Ritz bar. -And I have only three men. -We'll loose them, Mihai! Lonescu! Come! You gather all the men. You call them, you do what you want. We have only three men. We have to block the streets. Diamandi, Costache Marina and Motin. -Understand? -Yes. -Ritz is here. Move! -Yes. Well, guys... I have an idea. -How many are we? -About 50. -Fifty... -Yes. Take some guns. Mr. Roman, give me gun, please. What for? You know how to shoot? I fought on the battlefront. I'm wounded in the knee. Stay here with some men. -No one leaves. -I understand. This is the one. You're the one? Get up! Guys! Disperse through the restaurant. Pick up anyone you recognize. You too! Police! Police! Get them! Enough! Stop! Give me that! That's enough! What happened? Three of the mobsters from the bar locked themselves in the shelter. -Are they armed? -With machine-guns. They want to let them free. We surrounded the building. -Is there another exit? -No, just this one, here. -Do you have a Browning? -Yes. -Give it to me. -There you go. You, up there! I want to talk to you. If you want to talk, get up here! Leave the guns down. Hands up! So, tell me... You saw what awaits you outside. Surrender and I promise you... -What do you promise? -He's alright. Don't make anything foolish, or the workers will have no followers... What? Are you afraid of an inspector? Pavel, he's right. We should surrender. Me? Surrender?! You're afraid... God damn you! I'll kill all of you! -All of you! -You're drunk, put the gun down! Wait! Don't push! Wait! Wait, people! Don't push! -What is it, Buffalo Bill? -Dragan... -Get it. -Mister Dragan... What are you doing? What I've been doing all my life. I'm working. You're hair turned grey. I'm so glad to see you! We should celebrate this meeting. Want to get something to drink? Fine. I know a place. And you? Badly... I'm a police inspector. -You're still a Party activist? -Right. Sort of... I work for the National Security... -National Security. You're very busy -Yes, I am... This morning, for example, I received an order to arrest you. -Me?! -Yes. You're still a joker... During the night of 25 December, you committed an abuse of power in the village of Craciunesti. But I told you, I explained already... To make things worse, you arrested the citizen Semaca, farmer. I found a storehouse full of arms, get it? As far as I know, you're an inspector with a certain amount of experience. The Craciunesti case wasn't for the police to handle. You should've called us, the National Security. It was easy to see this was a political matter. You complicated the disclosure of a espionage network and this case was in the jurisdiction of National Security. Mr. Semaca was set free, and we have to say sorry. I was very pleased to have to say sorry to him. And, as they say in the distinguished environment you work, you're in deep shit... Only God can help you get out of this mess. Our Father, bless the food, the drink and your followers. Amen! Amen. Why do eat so much? You'll feel sick again, tonight. If the ghost will put me to the test, I'll go... They gathered in our monastery all the poor souls from the other monasteries God punished with fire during the war. And because of them we'll starve to death. Brother Serapion, the apostle says: "Help one another and live like brothers." Yes, but they are too many! -It was nicer at brewery... -Shut up, you idiot! The beans are not bad at all. Want some more? -No. -How come? -No. You didn't know? -No. Come on... It's snowing in March, comrade Roman. Who the hell saw something like this? Shut up. Don't make God angry. -Do you have one more can? -Yes. But be careful not to get sick, comrade Roman? It's the third one... My son, I am Father Avacum and I'm hungry. What's more, I'm feeling weak. -Did you learned anything? -Not in the matter you're concerned. Pour me a glass of wine and light me a cigarette. In the other matter, however, I saw, among the masons, one who is not a mason. And I don't know where to place him. Here... I don't know who he is. May I have some? -I think, comrade Roman... -Listen to me, Sherlock Holmes. I'm looking for the needle in a haystack and you come now to... I'm sorry, Mr. Roman, I feel offended. I have to go. Today it's my turn at the service. Too bad you can't hear me. -What did you do with the rabbit? -I put it in red wine. Be very careful! God help us! Everybody listen! Peace be with us! And with your spirit. Brothers, we, the ones with strength have the duty to carry the weaknesses of the weak ones. And not to please ourselves, but to please those around us. -Who is he? I don't know him. -His name is Avacum. Where did he come from? God knows. Maybe from a monastery in ruins. Peace be with you, reader! Father, with a voice like this, he'll become abbot. I'll be very happy if this honor will be bestowed upon one who's more worthy than me. Brother Avacum, please forgive me for disturbing your prayers. Do you need something, Father? You were praying so nicely, from the heart... Who knows what troubles have filled your young life... Many, Father. I feel you're worried. What brings you to me? I just took you to my heart. I know you for a little while, but it feels like you're my brother. Unfortunately, many people came here. And this morning, going through the chambers of some brothers, what do you think I found? Some sweets? God help us... Devil's tools in the house of the Lord. What shall I do with them? Father, I say throw them to the latrine. Do you want to know where I found it? Why me? No, I'm not saying anything. Trouble is all I need, God forbid! I don't need it either, brother. You're picking your nose again, Father. Abbott, I saw our brother in the faith Serapion putting some things in the water. What are you talking about? Father Gideon cursed when he fed the chickens. Brother Avacum seems to be very pious and he likes to keep to himself, but we'll see. Yesterday night, Father Veniamin went to the village. He has a mistress there, one Vasilica a young widow... Father, get well soon, Father Veniamin is scheming to become abbot... My son, you're haunted by the telling spirit. I work for you, Father. You said something about Avacum... Where is he coming from? How did he get here? He comes from Pustnicu, the monastery that was bombed. -And how did he escape? -Only God knows. We have someone from Pustnicu, that mute and deaf fellow. Didn't they meet? You think Roman will manage? At the National Security, I am forced to work with people I don't trust. That's why I came to Mihai Roman. What do you know about Reisenauer? According to our data, it seems Reisenauer is hiding here. -He spoke Romanian quite well. -He was born in Transylvania. He was specialized in Romanian affairs, a true archive of German intelligence And there are plenty of customers for such a precious archive. That's right. Recently, a member of the Allies Control Commission received on offer from the honorable Mister Semaca. And? I don't think they agreed upon the price. Following Semaca, I stumble upon a very curious relationship with a monastery improvised in this region. Here sought refuge monks from Moldavia and Transylvania. A identity almost impossible to prove. He couldn't have found a better hiding place. It's a theory. But, for the moment, it's the only lead we have. Arresting Semaca seemed at that time to be bad for our plans. We let him free and now we're waiting. Meanwhile, Roman has to identify Reisenauer. -Roman's story is solid? -Of course! He is a monk from Pustnicu, a monastery that burnt down in 1944. It is well known that, out of the 19 monks, none escaped alive. Semaca kept in touch with that guy from the Allied Commission? No. He disappeared from the hotel Athne Palace. Maybe he went for instructions. -I saw Roman. -Get out of here! I'm telling you it's him! I'm certain! Are you crazy? Why should Roman be here? And disguised as a monk... I know this. It's Roman for sure. If he recognizes us, we're in big trouble! Keep your voice down! Why should we be in trouble? And what's the problem? You're an idiot! Who are only ones who know Semaca robbed Lembert jewelry store? You brother and myself... We're witnesses! That's why Mr. Semaca got us in here. It's clear? I am crazy? Roman is looking for us in order to get Semaca. Maybe we'll talk... You start to learn... He catches us. If we speak, Semaca's men get to us. If we keep silent, the cop will beat us to death. My brother, we're in deep shit. Where are you going so early, brother Serapion? I'm getting a bit of fresh air. I feel like I suffocate, for a while... Yes, the morning air is fresh, especially since it smells of fresh fish from the lake. It's true you managed to escape from Pustnicu? God is merciful... We have another one from Pustnicu. He was brought here by somebody. He is mute, deaf and a little dumb. Maybe because of the ordeal... I think so, Father... It was pouring bombs. What's his name? Is the one who goes with the cows on the field. I thought I was the only one who got away. Father, you know what? Go get your fish. If Onofrei finds it, you're in big trouble. Teodosie! Teodosie! Brother Teodosie, don't you recognize me? I am Avacum, from Pustnicu! -Don't move, Mr. Roman! -Flecu, don't be a fool! Hurry! They'll find us with the dead man here... -Come here, you two! -Don't hit me, please... -Who brought you here? -Mr. Semaca. Why? Why here? -We don't know. -How come? You're lying. -Don't hit me, Mr. Roman. -You're lying! -We're not lying. -Why did he brought you here? -Why? -Problems, Father Avacum? Nothing, Father. I'm listening to their confessions. Come here. Sit down. I believe you, when you're saying Semaca hid you here. But I don't believe when you're sayin you don't know why. But this is another matter. Look what I want from you, for now. You're going to follow that mute and deaf fellow. Understand? -Yes... -And you'll follow the sleepwalker. -Yes, sir! -Like a shadow. Don't try to trick me or I'll kill you like Miclovan! Maybe you can escape from Semaca, but not from me. God bless you, Mr. Roman! If you say so... With the gift that the Lord gave me, I lift some of your sins from you, non-believers. -You're a real idiot! -Who's idiot? -Rica? Are you sleeping? -No... -Where is the mute? -On the lake, there! On the lake... Ilie, not a word! Out! Hurry up! -Mr. Roman, where... -Keep quiet! Where were you all day? I was looking for you. Shut up! Listen here! You tell all the agents that Reisenauer has disappeared, OK? He found me. It was Teodosie, the mute and deaf. Go! Mr. Roman, I know now who is the mason. -I'll kill you! Go! -I'm going! He passed away, poor mute... It was not his time, yet. Good God, such a misfortune on us! Right now, when our benefactor is coming... I say we hurry up. He should be here any moment now... God forgive him, poor man! -Did you set up everything? -Yes, abbot. All the monks. All, you hear? Search all over the place. It's your responsibility, Onufrie! If it's not right, five months I'll keep you on bread and water. Take the body of our departed brother and take care of the proper things. God forgive him! He wanted to eat some fish. In this fasting... Here, take something warm. Mr. Semaca. -We're near the water, it's cold. -How's the game here? We'll find something, by the grace of God. What time do you want to have dinner -We'll see. Everything's ready? -Yes. -Your men? -In place, awaiting your signal. Let's go! We're wasting time. -You think we'll have nice weather? -Very nice. -How did you find me? -This is not the important thing now You have to decide right now. There's a car waiting outside. -I'm waiting for your reply. -I don't think I have an option... You can surrender to the communists... -I'm at your disposal. -Mr. Reisenauer... Mr. Reisenauer, I know of an impressive archive. I know also it's very complete. My superiors are very keen to read this archive. Comrade Roman! Father! Mr. Roman! Comrade Roman! Comrade Roman! Comrade Roman! Comrade! Comrade Roman! -Are you insane? -Comrade Roman, I recognized him! I saw him at Mr. Semaca's mansion, in uniform. He 's talking with that monk... What' his name? It starts with an "S". -Serapion. -Exactly! He waits for him. He speaks a language I don't understand. -Serapion... -There's a car waiting! Hurry! The wall! -Faster! -Faster, Mr. Roman... Where did you learn how to drive? On the tanks. I told you I fought in the war. They are mine! Mr. Roman, why don't you shoot the tires? You think we're in the movies, llie? Get on the right and push them off the road. One more time! One more time, llie! We'll push him off the road now! Stop! -It's finished, Mr. Roman. -Stop the car. So it's like this, Father Serapion... Father Avacum, I'm at your disposal. -I'm from the Allied Commission... -I know, major. Pleased to meet you. Come on! Without llie, Jean Semaca's trick with the hunt would've succeeded. We'd probably lost Reisenauer, but... -Anyway, I congratulate you. -Thank you, Father. Where do you want to spend your five days leave? -I can't give you more. -I think a monastery is in order... But, if possible, maybe a convent. That's right. But I had a surprise for you, today. I'm listening. The fellow from the Allied Commission was very fair-play. He gave us all the details we wanted, so we let him go. I thought you'd be delighted to arrest Semaca. -The antiquary? -No, Mihai. Our Semaca. Yes, now you have all the evidence to arrest the antiquary, also. And I have another surprise for you. Here are the arrest warrants for both of them. You have an address, also. You know it? Madame Evelyne's... Give him to drink. Be nice with the gentleman. Don't move, guys... Wait. Do you have any preference, inspector? Yes. You. Here's the warrant. -Again? -This time for good, I hope. I want more champagne. -Roman, boss! -Who? Roman! Stay calm... We meet again. What can you do? I have to admit, it's not good for my reputation. Semaca, this time, you're in trouble. Rica and Flecu send you all the best wishes. You're accused of murder and robbery of Lembert jewellry store. Leave us. Come, girls... and 10000 dollars. and 15000 dollars. Be smart, mister! It's a fortune! No, Semaca. I hope to add to your performances the attack against the demonstrants. And Miclovan's death... You're an idiot, inspector. You can't buy everybody, Semaca. You're insane! There are ten of my men in the house and outside. Ten! You see? You're an idiot! I'll shoot you and the first one who'll come here'll be my man. After him will come your agents. And what will they found out? A dead inspector and a gun with my man's fingerprints on it. -Is it clear? -Quite clear... But don't forget that Rica et Flecu are under arrest. Without you, I'll manage. Take out your gun and put it on the floor. Turn around. You see, Roman? I, too, work with clean hands, like you say. That's right, Semaca, it's like you said, with clean hands... I have my soft points, too...
