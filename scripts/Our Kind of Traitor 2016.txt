He's the one who's staring. Look. Hello? No, that's fine. I might be a couple of minutes late, though. Or there's a Chteau Ptrus for 16,000 euro we might try. Great, thank you. Bye. They moved my call forward. All right. See you later. I did tell you that I'd have to do some work. Come have a drink with us. - I'm okay, thanks. - It's not okay. Your woman just left you. Come on. Don't be a sourpussy. Sourpuss, actually. Sourpuss. Okay, don't be a sourpuss. Come on, have a drink with us. What the fuck? Come on. That is Niki, Andrei. You don't need to know those people. - I'm Dima. - Perry. Sit down, Perry. Do you want some wine? - Sure. - Chteau Ptrus. There you go. Why did your woman leave you, Perry? - She had to make a call. - Call the kids? No, we don't have any kids. You don't have time for kids? You a banker? No, I teach at a university. A teacher. Then how the fuck can you afford this restaurant? My wife is a successful lawyer. How long are you in Morocco for? We leave in a couple of days. Why don't you come to a party with us tonight? It's a Russian party. Maybe another time. What other time? I'll never fucking see you again. - I can't tonight. - What? Your lawyer wife pussy-whip you? You have to ask her permission? Let's play a game. Show me your credit card. Show me your credit card. Hold it up to me. It's a game. Now put it away. If I remember the number on that card, you come with me to the party, and if I fuck up, I'll give you $5,000, okay? All right. Call your wife, Professor. Hey, it's me again. Look, you must still be on your call. I popped out for a drink with those guys from the restaurant and I just didn't want you to worry. So I'll see you later, okay? Bye. No, no. - Dima. - Maria. Meet my friend, Perry. This is Maria. Nice to meet... - Nice to meet you. - Hi. Nice to meet you. You will look after him tonight? Of course. No problem. - Perry, come with me. - Okay, yeah, yeah. You want some? So, what do you teach? It's so boring. Tell me. Poetics. Poetry isn't boring. It is when you study it under a microscope. Then why do you do it? I don't know. Lack of imagination. I don't believe you. You're very pretty. So are you. Let me get you another drink. Yeah, that's a good idea. Thanks. My God. Shit. Professor! What am I doing here? Watch Movies and Series! Help! Stop! - No! - Hey, hey! Get off her! Fucking prick. Come on, then! Hey, he's my guest. 50, go, go. Go, go. Okay, Professor? What the fuck is going on? You're a crazy motherfucker, Professor. Did you see that guy's tattoos? The knife on the neck means he kills people. The stars on the shoulders means he's a big mafia guy. I wish I'd known that at the time. It wouldn't have made any difference. You're a gentleman. Man of honour. You know what this is? Um... Virgin Mary? It's my mother. When I was a kid in Russia, we had no money, so my mother fucked this Kagbeshnik, KGB guy, so we could eat, you know. He was like that guy. He liked to hurt women. One day, I come home and he's there and he's fucking her like an animal and slapping her. I'm just standing there. And my mother looks at me. She doesn't say anything. So I take his gun and I kill him. What the fuck? It was my mother. You get sentimental. You play tennis, Professor? Yes, a little. We'll play today. I have to spend the day with my wife. We'll play early. Good return, Viktor. it's yours, Viktor. Take it, take it! Game Russia. It's okay. Just hit it to my dad. What the fuck? We'll get them next time. Come on. Okay, we've got this. Come on. Here we go. Morning. You got my note, then? Yeah, I did. - Out! - Fault. Second service. Hello. I'm Gail. What are your names? I'm Irina and this is Katya. That's very pretty- Are those Russian bears? No, they are Swiss bears. Our mummy and daddy bought them at the bear garden in Bern. Is that your mummy over there? Our mummy and daddy are dead. I'm sorry. - Fuck! - Yes! Watch your language. Game, set and match Great Britain. Next time you get Dad. You're a lousy tennis player, Professor. Yes, and so are you. - Your wife. - Hey. What is a beautiful woman like you doing with a lousy tennis player like this? - I've no idea. - I'm Dima. I'm Gail. Meet my beautiful wife Tamara. It's lovely to meet you. Perry says that you are a famous lawyer. I'm definitely not famous. - What kind of law? - I'm a barrister. Barrister? Yeah. Looks like you had quite a bash last night. Yes. Yeah, I walked into a door. Stupid. You should have seen the door. It's my daughter Natasha's birthday today. Why don't you come to the villa for a small party tonight? Well, that's very sweet, but it's our last night. So we're gonna do something... Just a drink. Just a drink. I'll have a car pick you up and take you back. It would make us very happy. This is a small party? We'll just stay half an hour and leave, okay? Natasha, look. - My God. - Happy birthday. Isn't he beautiful? He's bought her a camel. Look. Look at the harness. What's she gonna do with a camel? It was made in New York. Tanya! When did you come in? - Happy birthday. - Thank you. You can meet Andrei. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. So how old are you today? Eighteen, but my father still thinks I'm a little girl. - Girls. - Hey, hello. You look amazing. I'll get a drink. Do you want one? Yeah. I'll have a glass of champagne. Right. It's a great party. No, no, no, it's fine. Okay. One... Two, three... - Four... - Do we just help ourselves? Five, six, seven... - Eight, nine... - Hi, Perry. How are you? Hello. I'm good. Nice to see you. Ten! it's a lovely party. - Let me press it. - No, no, no. Fire! {fireworks exploding) Dima. You know what the Vory is, Professor? No. It's like mafia but with honour. I control accounts for the Vory because I'm good with money, I'm very good. I had a friend, Misha, who worked for me. When the Vory became international, they sent us to Europe. We washed money, make everyone rich. But that was under the old prince. He was a man of honour. He was like Misha, like me. But now his son, the new prince, he's a traitor of traitors. He sold out the Vory to the state, made a deal with the Kremlin. When the mafia cleans up its act, it becomes legitimate and everybody makes money with each other. I'm not sure why you're telling me this, Dima. Do you like these two little girls, Katya and Irina? - The twins. - Yeah, of course. Do you want to know how their parents died? The new prince invited Misha, his wife and their eldest daughter to Moscow, made him sign over the accounts that he controlled and then had them killed. I'm like Misha. I'm a threat to the Prince. I'm a threat to Kremlin. I know where the money comes from. They will kill me. They will kill my family too if you don't help me, Help you? What can I do? When you go back to London, give this to your MIG. At the airport you tell them you have a gift from the number one money launderer from the Russian mafia. Tell who? Dima, you've gut the wrong guy. I have no one else. All these fuckers, the lawyers, the bankers and bodyguards, they all work for the Prince. They watch me all the time. They listen to my phone calls. I have no one else. Watch Movies and Series! You have good time tonight? Fabulous. Look, we can walk from here. Thanks for the lift. Gail! Go on, then. Where did you disappear with that girl? I saw you going into the villa with her. - I was talking with Dima. - What about? He was showing me round his house. I'm not an idiot, Perry. Come on, Gail. Nothing happened. You were the one who wanted to come on this trip. Yeah, 'cause I want things to be like they were before. I want things to be better. Well, then why did we spend our last night with a bunch of strangers? Well, you haven't exactly been available yourself. Fuck off. Next, please. - Good afternoon, sir. - Hello. Welcome back. Thanks. Next, please. There's some problem with my passport. You should go on. - You all right? - I'll catch up. Yeah. Excuse me. Can you tell me how much longer this is going to take? Because I've been waiting for two hours. I'm afraid that's my fault, Mrs McKendrick. If you'd like to follow me. I said I didn't want my wife involved. I'm sorry. Would you like her to wait outside? Involved in what? I brought something over for Dima. What? I don't know. Perhaps you'd like to sit down. I have some questions. Not tough. Medium soft. Is this all he gave you? - Yeah. - Didn't offer you any money? He did, but I refused. Then why did you bring it? I thought it was the right thing to do. He said that his children would be killed if I didn't. You believed him? He seemed scared. He told you he was a member of the Russian mafia. And you still agreed to help him. You haven't checked the contents of the memory stick? No, no, I thought I could just hand it over and be done with it. I thought that would be it, you know. Why do you think he chose you? I think he just took a punt. We may need to speak to you again after we've checked the memory stick. In the meantime, we'll need all your details. And we'll need you to sign this. Thanks. I couldn't say no to him. And why not? I thought I could keep you out of it. Everything has consequences, Perry. You fuck one of your students, there are consequences. You run errands for a Russian mobster, same thing. Look, I'm sorry about everything. No sign of anyone following them. Did you have time to wade through the material we bunged at you, Billy, or did it interfere with your golf'? I can't stand fucking football. We're not going to the match. - Who authorised this? - You did. Target headed for the Diamond Suite. Why am I here? We've had some intelligence from a potential source, the principal money launderer for the Russian mafia. Why didn't you mention this before? Because you wouldn't have come. - Champagne? - No, thank you. The man in the dark suit is Nicolas Petrov, the Prince, a highly successful and legitimate businessman, as far as the world's concerned. He's taken over the Russian crime syndicate since his father died. Man next to him is his consigliere, Emilio Del Oro. The Russian mafia has nothing to do with us. Patience, Billy. Bushmaster's here. Thanks, Ollie. Our source wants to prove his worth. He's told us that the Prince is in London to meet a prominent British politician. Who the hell's Bushmaster? A bushmaster is a breed of snake, Billy. Evening, sir. Our former boss. Current MP for lslington North and head of the parliamentary subcommittee for trade and finance, Aubrey Longrigg- I can see who it is. - Aubrey. - Hello. - What a pleasure. - How are you? Nice to see you again, Emilio. My colleague, Mr Petrov. Mr Petrov, at last. - Are you a Tvarat fan? - An Arsenal fan. An Arsenal fan'? You can't condemn a man for going to a football match. Not even if he's here to meet the head of the Russian mafia? So far it's nothing more than a coincidence. Well, according to our source, the Prince is offering Longrigg a substantial sum of money. For what? Two days ago the Arena Bank of Cyprus, a subsidiary of Petrov's empire, filed an application to establish a trading bank in the city. The purpose of this bank? To launder billions of dollars of Russian mafia money here in London. What does that have to do with Longrigg? The application was backed by a distinguished list of British politicians, lawyers and bankers, all recruited by our friend Aubrey. The game's about to start. We should find our seats. Watch Movies and Series! Is that it? For now. I'm not getting involved in your personal vendetta with Longrigg. It's more than my job's worth. There's nothing personal about it. The man's a traitor. He was corrupt when he was in the service and he's corrupt now. He's working for the Russian mafia, and so are dozens of the most powerful bankers and politicians in this country. You've no proof. Let me make the source an offer and I'll get you the proof. Never before have we had an informant this high up in Russian organised crime. You won't get another opportunity like this, Billy. What does he want? Asylum for himself and his family. That's out of the question. The last thing the Foreign Office needs is another row with Russia, and the Home Office doesn't offer asylum to criminals. These men are betraying their country, Billy. I'm sorry, Hector, I'm not going after Longrigg or anybody else based on some Russian mobsters word. I don't like the cunt any more than you do. But I'm protecting you from yourself. This stops now. What did Matlock say? He said we're on. Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, "a crowd flowed over London Bridge, "so "I had not thought death had undone so many, "sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled, "and each man fixed his eyes before his feet." You see, Eliot is borrowing from Dante's Inferno, drawing a parallel between his century and the Florentine poet's vision of hell. Both writers, their societies had become corrupt, and more than that, listless. And Eliot felt that 20th-century Britain was full of lost souls. There's nothing that links him to the house on Tuesday and all of the forensic evidence we can explain away because of their past... Relationship, Um, can I speak to you later about this, please, Dolly? - Yes, of course. - Great. Thank you. Well, this is a coincidence. Not exactly. I don't even know your name. Luke. I'm gonna bet that's not your real name. No? Shall we? I'm sorry to call you back like this, but we've had a chance to examine the contents of the memory stick. Did Dima ever mention your involvement in any future negotiations? What negotiations? He's asked to meet us in Paris. He wants you there when we make contact with him. - Why? - He doesn't trust us. Probably worried we'll get the information we need out of him and feed him back to the wolves. - But he hardly knows me. - He knew you well enough to know you'd pass on his message. Obviously thinks you're a man of principle. I can't get involved. Well, I'm afraid you are involved. Trouble is, from the moment you accepted the memory stick, he put his life and the lives of his children in your hands. If his children are in danger, ifs his own fault. We have no obligation whatsoever to this man. These are the parents of the twins that you met. And this is the older sister, Anna. She was 17. You're a prick. Well, that's as may be. Believe me, I would rather not have you mixed up in this either. Dima has a meeting in Bern next week where he'll sign over the accounts he controls to the prince, just like his old friend Misha did. After that, he and his family will most likely be executed. Trouble is, he'll only deal with us if you and Gail are there. He refuses to negotiate with us otherwise. He'll be working on the assumption that if we betray him, you good people will stand up for him and his family. He's making a lot of assumptions. What choice does he have? He's trying to protect the people he loves. They're using you. Just like Dima. Well, it doesn't make it any easier to say no. You don't even know these people. You don't know the people that you defend. And you do everything you can for them, whether they're innocent or not. I can't stop thinking about him. His family, those kids. If something should happen to them... May I ask you a question? Does Bill Matlock know we're using civilians? Yes. What are you working on? I'm reading about the Vory. That's what Dima is, isn't he? It describes how they recruit people in jail. They look for people who are disillusioned with their lives, people who've lost their way, and they give them back their sense of purpose. Dima's attending a fashion show with the prince a1 {he Pam Palais. Your cover is you're there to see an exhibition on a romantic weekend. Assuming he shows up, let him approach you. When he does, look surprised, then listen carefully to every word he says. Just be yourselves. I! his companions question you, stick to the truth as much as you can. It's always more convincing. Professor! What the fuck are you doing here? Dima. First I kiss your wife. Lovely to see you. Don't tell me he's taking you to a fucking museum. Yeah, I'm afraid so. Dante iliusire. When you're in Paris, you should take your wife shopping, you know? - What kind of man are you? - What are you doing here? Well, I'm on my way to Bern, but my boss wants to see the fashion show. And how are your gorgeous family? They're all good. Natasha is here. Natasha. All the rest are in Switzerland. It's nice to see you again. Hey. How are you doing? Aren't you going to introduce us to your friends, Dima? I'm Gail and this is my husband Perry. - Hey. - Emilio Del Oro. How do you know Dima? We met on holiday. How do you feel about Paris? How long are you gonna stay? How long are you in town for? We leave the day after tomorrow. Okay, so tomorrow we play tennis. I'll beat the shit out of you. Anything else that stood out? Just the tennis. 12:00 at the Club des Rois. Well, he also said, "I'll buy you a massage after I beat you." Yeah. You okay to go? Do we have a choice? We'll make contact tomorrow and it'll be over, I promise. Okay. Mondays, the resident masseurs at the Club des Rois have the day off. They only come in by appointment. Clever bastard. - Good morning. - Morning. Too early for a glass of champagne? Never too early for me. Professor! Good to see you. Gail, you beautiful woman. - Everything okay? - Yes. I've got clothes for you. Gail, you look after my Natasha? Yeah, of course. - I'll bring it over. - Thanks. Nice to see you again. There you go. - Right. - This way. - I've never been here before. - Really? - Shall we have a seat? - Yeah. Did you have a good night, Professor? Great. And yours? Shit. After you. It's good to meet you. I need some of your famous fucking British fair play. First of all we have to decide if what you have to offer is worthwhile. My information is good. My papa just told me about it. But you've been to Paris before? Yes. - And you? - Yeah. - I've been to Paris before. - Time's up. Gotta go. Hello, boys. Fuck. Names, addresses. Bankers, politicians. Names and addresses. No account numbers. Nothing we can't find in the phone book. An extraordinary list of names, though. It's no good to us so far. Are you all right? (Wm You've stopped breathing, Professor. Calm. You'll have a heart attack. A list of names and personal information isn't enough. I need proof that all these people are being paid by the Prince. You get my family to England, I'll tell you everything. You cooperate or there'll be no deal. You give that list to your bosses and see what they say. I know what it's worth. I want UK passports. I want 24-hour protection for my family. How much are these people being guaranteed if the Arena Bank gets its license in London? 5 million each. And Aubrey Longrigg? 10 million on signature. Another 10 million on first day of trading. All paid to a secret account in Switzerland. I need their account numbers. Bankers, politicians, all of them. I don't have them until after Bern. I make the payments to them at the same time I sign over the accounts that I control to the Arena Bank. Well, then, I'm afraid I can't do anything for you or your family until then. Why can't you get them out now? This doesn't concern you. It's okay, Professor. When does the signing take place? Wednesday at 10:00 at the Allied Bank in Bern. After that, the prince will have a reception at the Bellevue Hotel. You get me their account numbers, we'll find a way to smuggle you out. I don't give a fuck what happens to me. I want my family safe. We will try to take care of them, too. I give you my word. I don't trust your fucking word. Well, then, it's the end of the conversation. Okay. I'll go with the prince to Bern. I'll get the fucking numbers. - Where do you live in London? - Chelsea. - Are you happy? - In Chelsea? With your husband? That's a very direct question. I'm curious why a couple who've been married 10 years would take two romantic holidays in the space of a month. Where is he taking us? Why are we going on the motorway? I have to drop something for a friend. It's okay, it's on the way. We need to get to our hotel. Just a few minutes. What happened in there? He gave him another memory stick, but it didn't seem to be enough. They used his children's lives to bargain with him. I just stood there and said nothing. Well, what could you say? I have to wait for her. I'm sorry, Professor. Well, how long is she gonna be? 15 minutes. Get us a taxi. No, taxi take longer. Come inside. We'll leave as soon as she comes. It's not safe here. My friend comes soon. Have some tea. Come, come, come. Sit, sit, sit. No, thanks. Thank you. It's funny you here in Paris. Why is it funny? You, me, Dima. It's like Morocco. It was sunnier in Morocco. No, merci. No, thanks. Who you work for, Professor? I teach at a London university. Maybe I come visit you in London, visit your house, we go to football match together. Stop! Fucking prick. - You fucking prick! - It's okay. It's okay. It's not okay. What kind of guy does that? You feel like a big man? Feel like a big guy now, do you? A big fucking strong guy? Fucking idiot. - She needs a doctor. - We'll look after her. What are you doing? Calling an ambulance is what I'm doing. It's okay. - It's okay. I call doctor. - Yeah? - It's all right. - Do it, then. Do it now. You lied to Dima, you lied to them and you lied to me. Bill Matlock has no idea we're here, does he? If you're concerned about your career, you can always go back to counterterrorism. Fuck you. Once we have those account numbers, London may listen to us. Until then, they won't. You okay? No, we're not okay. A car will come to meet you off the Eurostar at St Pancras and take you home. When will the family arrive in England? Well, Dima's signing in Bern is next Wednesday morning. What's the matter? We don't know when we can get the family out. Why not? Because the operation hasn't been sanctioned. What does that mean? It means that once we get Dima back to the UK, I'll be able to make a case for the family. They'll kill them. We don't have the people or the resources to smuggle them all out. Getting his family out is all he wants. That's all that matters to him. Dima hasn't given me enough to bargain with. Our own authorities won't accept them... - They're children. - They're his children. How many people do you have? Just the three of us. And how many would you need? If you leave his family behind, do you think he's gonna give you those account numbers? Watch Movies and Series! May I sit down? Yeah. Have you ever read any Kolakowski? He's a Polish philosopher. Very stern views on good and evil, which I share. Evil is evil, not rooted in a social circumstance. Not about being deprived. Not even controlled by God. It's an entirely separate human force. I have a son. He's in jail for selling drugs. I believe Aubrey Longrigg, who was my boss before he went into politics, tipped off the police to discredit me when I was making trouble for him at MI6. It's not the reason I'm doing this, but, um... I want you to know that I have children, too. I'll do everything I can for the family. Papa, museums are boring. Especially Einstein and maths. Do you know what Einstein himself said? You think you've got problems with arithmetic? I've got more fucking problems. Your mother and your sister want to go. End of story. Come on, let's go, assholes. You have to sign twice for each numbered account. Here and here. Ladies and gentlemen, you each need to countersign for your individual accounts. The funds will then be transferred. This is the Bern telephone conferencing center. Please enter your four-digit passcode. Morning, boys and girls. H! cue you when I see Dima's party on the way to the Bellevue Hoiel. No one to move until men. This... Pen doesn't work. Thank you. One last signature here transferring all remaining funds to the Arena Bank. The only time my father ever hit me... I remember that story. I also remember when you were a little child, Kolya, and your father and I took you hunting. You were 12, maybe 13 years old and you were so excited. You couldn't wait to kill something. And then we saw this buck and you raised the rifle, but the buck just looked at you, kept on grazing. It wasn't afraid. You tried and tried to pull that trigger, but you couldn't. So you started crying like a little girl. Sol had to take the rifle and kill it for you. Papa's on the move. They'll be with you shortly at the Bellevue. Luke, make sure he sees you in the lobby. Perry, wait for them in the car. If Dima asks how his family are, tell him they're safe even if they're not. You're there to reassure him. Ollie, Gail, you're good to go. to link acoustically or otherwise commutable signs to sense-impressions. Most likely, all sociable animals have arrived at this primitive kind of communication, at least to a certain degree. Green to go. By the end of the week, we will have our license and begin trading in London. To the future of the Arena Bank. Arena Bank. To all my friends who have made this possible... I say thank you. We Russians have had a mixed reputation in Europe recently. But... But for all the disagreements and suspicions of recent times, I believe Russia's economic strength... furthermore, the equation E is equal MC squared, shows that a very small amount of mass. .. may be converted into a very large amount of energy. Quickly. Come on. Come on, quick as you can. Where's your mother? That's it, get up there. In you get. There's no new Cold War. You have welcomed us with open arms... And you will find us committed partners. Family secure. What the fuck do you want, you shit ants? I'm going for a pee. Fuck off! Dima's heading for the kitchen, but I can't follow him. Too many bodyguards. It's impossible for me to lead him to Perry. We need to get him out before they realise his family is missing. Dima. Dima. Dima, stop. Fucking stop. Professor. What the fuck are you doing here? We have to go. I've got Dima. Luke, get the car to the side entrance. Are my kids safe? They're fine. They're on their way. Any news? Well, if you can't give me the answer, get me the fucking minister. "- Hello, boys! - Papa! We're going to London! - You all right? - Hey! - Look at my girls. Wow! - Yeah, yeah, Dima! Natasha. - We did good. - Good. Well done. - Thanks. - Right, let's get going. Hello? I can't hear you, Billy. You'll have to speak up. I chartered the plane myself, Billy. You owe me 6,000. What? What is it? What's the matter? There's been a hold-up, but there's nothing to worry about. Don't you fucking lie to me. Longrigg convinced the Home Office to deny you and your family entry. And what can you do about it? Go back to London and change their minds. I'll need those account numbers. Fuck you. It'll help me make a case. You get my family to London, I'll give you those numbers. You should come back on the plane with me. No. We're staying with them. I can't guarantee your safety. They'll be coming after you. Then you'd better hurry. I knew I couldn't trust this guy. Change cars. Get them across the border. Head for Pralognan. There's a safe house near there. You went behind my back. - What do you expect? - Your support. Get off your fucking high horse, Hector. You're lucky I'm even considering this. If Longrigg has got a scent of something, we need to act quickly. It isn't just Longrigg. You know how delicate relations are with Russia. If their Foreign Minister picks up the phone about this, we can't ignore him. What, so we're still taking orders from the Kremlin? Where are you hiding them? We have a meeting with the secretary tomorrow. You'd better convince him what Dima has to offer is worth the grief. Hector. You look ravishing. It's really noisy. Time for bed, my sweet. Come on. I'll read to you. Don't worry. I won't be long. I assume this isn't a social visit. No, actually. You betrayed the service, Aubrey, and now you've betrayed your country, and I'm gonna hang you up by your fucking balls if ifs the last thing I do. Have we not had this conversation before? It didn't tum out quite as you expected as far as I remember. How is your son, by the way? Not as well as your beautiful family. Keep swinging, Hector. I'll leave that to the prince. I'm going to make sure that your plan to help your Russian friends doesn't go as smoothly as they expect. And then I'll watch them fuck you up. Thank you. Andrei? Yes. I tried to call you so many times. Are you okay? No, I'm not. Everything will be okay. I'll look after you. I don'! know what to do. I can't bear this any longer. Just tell me where you are. I can't. Then talk to me. I love you. If the committee will allow me to fly the asset and his family here to the UK, I can prove that Aubrey Longrigg and these other traitors are being paid between five and 20 million pounds each for their support. Mr Secretary, the Arena Bank is not Russian, it's not subject to sanctions, and on top of that it's proposing to put billions into the City of London. If we investigate them based on the testimony of a self-confessed criminal, they'll simply take their money elsewhere. A man launders a million pounds, he's a crook, but a few billion, now you're talking. Money has no smell as long as there's enough of it. Who cares what the Russians do as long as they spend their cash here? There's really no need to be quite so emotional. You're right, Mr Secretary. We've all seen too much of the world. Not wanking around? And all the dirty money that's sloshing around, the profits of heartache and pain, we've seen that, too. Heroin in Afghanistan, billions. Arms in the Sudan, billions. Female trafficking, billions. An eighth of the world's fucking economy black as black. We all know that. Blood money. That's all it is.
