"Following just her heart." "Hearing the world as the tinkling of ankle bells." "Following just her heart." "These paths, these people, all insane." "Ways of wandering like the fakirs." "Folks welcome with smile." "Time, they have plenty." "Just searching... seeking..." "...Bonding." Are you going to Hasanpur? - Yes we are Could you hold my bag? - Why not? Thank you. "New routes, new paths new lanes." "One love, the note and the beat." "Evening embraces the afternoon, gently." "One love, the note and the beat." "The journey exhilarating." "Its radiance, scented sweet." "The folks are special." "Conversations fly." "One gives direction..." "...The other is caught in himself." What does it say? Bibi Saroop. The singer. Bibi Saroop. Singer? Everyone is a singer over here. They're singers too. Check them out. "Just like the flowing water." "And this perishable world." "The bond is the one of truth..." "...That will last forever." "And this flow..." "...With passion held so tight..." "...Is a connection just so true." "Learnt what it is to be free..." "...When I stepped out." "Searching... seeking..." "...Bonding." What do you think? Nice! Two years of body building. Having a good voice isn't easy. "Folks welcome with smile." "Time, they have plenty." "Just searching... seeking..." "...Bonding." The monkeys took your underwear! Shut up, you monkeys! I'll show you. Excuse me. Yes? Does Bibi Saroop live here? - Yes So? - Is she home? - No. She'll be back soon. Or maybe not. I don't know her timings. I am a music producer from Mumbai. I am here for a film. From where? - Mumbai. The one where Shahrukh is from? That's right. And you are a music director? - Yes. God is kind! You make tunes for films? - Exactly. God is kind! When will Bibi Saroop come home? She's out for the night. But don't you worry. Myself, A-one artist, Mastana. What? They call me Master Mastana. Bibi Saroop is my mother. Oh. I see. My singing quality is the best. Hear me once. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Please sit, I'll be back. God is very kind! "Catch a glimpse of my expensive underwear." "Take my liver and kidney free with my heart." "Take me to Vancouver or Sydney." "Take my liver and kidney free with my heart." "Take me to Vancouver or Sydney." "Take my liver and kidney free with my heart." "Take me to Vancouver or Sydney." What a voice. You sing really well. No need to mention. Thank you. Let me show you. Programme bookings for every week. I set the stage on fire. I shouldn't say it, but I'm the best. But nobody appreciates talent over here. Now that you're here, I might get lucky. Fantastic! This Sydney-kidney, what kind of song is this? You got it wrong. Weddings, birthdays, tributes or insults... you pay, I sing. I hear that your mother sings Punjabi Sufiana qalam. Baba Bulle Shah too. So-- She does. I sing that too. Really? Sing something. Baba Bulle Shah? "I will go." "I will go." Give me a minute. Where is it? Let's start. "I will go." "I will go with the wandering fakir." "I will go with the wandering fakir." "Wearing the long earrings." "Wearing the long earrings." "And a tilak on my forehead." "I will go with the wandering fakir." "I will go with the wandering fakir." "I will go with the wandering fakir." What's going on? Go! Go away. Come, let's go. Let's go. Who's she? Let me drop you. One second. Drop me where? Wherever you like. I came here straight from the station. I get it. There's a solution to every problem. Any hotel or guest house nearby? The hotels are all in town and no guest houses here. Then? Listen-- I have a small place. A hut. You can stay there if you like. It's basic, but peaceful. Up to you. Sounds good. I'll stay for a night. No. Stay as long as you like. Hotels don't have the same feel. As they say, home is home. Mastana... ...I'm really grateful. Grate-full is not necessary. Half is enough for me. Let's go. All set? Yes. The jungle water is over there. - Jungle water? Toilets were called jungle water earlier. Now there's no jungle or water. Rest now. I better leave. - Ok Listen. 88-88-90-76-75. Raga Puriya Dhanashri is not for everyone. My number. Oh! Ok. I'll go. Thank you. - Mastana. - Yes? Who was that lady? Lady? The one we ran away from. There are many ladies over here. It was your mother, Bibi Saroop. Why didn't you introduce me? She is not Madonna. You can meet her anytime. She was drunk. Listen. May I ask you something? Yes. I want the truth. My voice... is it good? Your voice is very special. I'd like to record you. And Bibi as well. Good night. Good night Sid, you scared me. Let me scare you some more. I have to work. Why do you always say the guy's line? Is it only men who work? - That's not what I meant. - You didn't? Tell me the truth. Do you really have to work? Or you aren't in a good mood as usual? Work. Look at it. You work all the time but nothing gets done. That's unfair. Ok, listen. I'm sorry. I had a bad day at the shoot. Listen. Let's try some other work. Sid, please don't. Sorry, but don't. What are you doing? What's going on? Why is it always "don't" with you? What's going on? - Let's not go there. - No, let's go there. Tell me. - What's your problem? - I don't know Sid. My music isn't working. I played tons of stuff to Nishant. He doesn't like any of it. I don't get it. I don't get it Vibs. We fight more than we talk. We don't do anything together anymore. What's going on? Sid, please. Leave me alone. Please. Fine. You don't deserve these. God damn it! Where were you yesterday? Why are you all dressed up? Why are you pushing me? You're such a pain. Speak softly. Can I speak? Say. A guest from Mumbai. A friend actually. A friend? From Mumbai? And I don't know. She's here to record me. She makes music for the film. - Have you been drinking? - I swear. From Mumbai? And she's here to meet you? Absolutely. She came looking for Bibi. But when I sang, she forgot all about Bibi. She said, "Mastana, I'll only record you." Record you? That's great! Yes, my love.You see I'm blessed. I'm also the best. Let's go. - Preeto. - What? I thought, rather than her wandering about, why not-- Why not what? Why not offer our guest, a place to stay? Oh God! Such a caring heart. Preeto! My heart cares for you, my love. But you don't understand my feelings. You are my special case. My precious bottle of wine. "I stand under a shower of love." "I have fought the whole world for you." "Do I deserve your taunts?" "I have fought the whole world for you." That was beautiful. Since when have you been singing? My dear... ...in our clan, a child's first cry is a melody. I've sung for as long as I can remember. Never thought of making an album? Don't know about that. A long time ago someone came talking about a cassette. He spoke sweetly. But his eyes were dishonest. He gave me 175 rupees. Never make a promise you can't keep. Maybe that recording led me to you. Led you to me? I came here looking for you. You tuneless soul, look at me! You liar. What did I do to deserve a son like you? Wait! Aren't you ashamed to tell me that she came looking for you? And you'll get my songs recorded too? Go sing your sleazy songs. You bastard. Go to hell! There they go again, mother and son. This is Maan Saab. I am next to him. Next to me is Sardool Saab. I've performed 27 shows with them. They respect me. I get paid in cash for every show. Get a colour photo with me too. I have a historic photo with you. It will be printed after you're gone. I'm not dying yet. Not in the mood. God bless you. Tumbi, dholki, sarangi, daff, harmonium, any instrument. Just remember one name, Jeeta. Your very own. 'Jeeta the Emotional'. Mic testing! Friends and brothers. Welcome. A top star! A unique star in the world of cinema. We have with us, Vibhavari. Let's welcome her with a round of applause. The biggest superstars have danced to her tunes. Our very own, Mr. Bachchan is a big fan. We're priveleged to have her here. So with her permission, I will present a new item. It's in a lighter vein, but very deep. Are you ready? Yes. Let's hear it. Way to go. Mastana is ready. Keep it up. C'mon, let it play. "Take my liver and kidney free with my heart." "Take me to Vancouver or Sydney." "Take my liver and kidney free with my heart." "Take me to Vancouver or Sydney.' "Love is the cream on top of sweet buttermilk." "Love is the cream on top of sweet buttermilk." "Take as much as you want." "Take my liver and kidney free with my heart." "Take me to Vancouver or Sydney." "Take my liver and kidney free with my heart." "Take me to Vancouver or Sydney." "A little dirty and a little flirty." "Some old and some so lissome." "Crass, crude, rude or seductive." "My love is for one and all." "Make me yours. I will thank you." 98-444-333-12. "Fear the lord, don't be rude." "Just stare at the ceiling and don't ask why." "Come hold me tight, sit behind me girl." "Come hold me tight, sit behind me girl." "And catch a glimpse of my expensive underwear." "My liver and kidney free with my heart." "Vancouver or Sydney." "Take my liver and kidney free with my heart." "Take me to Vancouver or Sydney." ."Take my liver and kidney free with my heart." "Take me to Vancouver or Sydney." "Take my liver and kidney free with my heart." "Take me to Vancouver or Sydney." "My liver and kidney free with my heart." That idiot! Fake notes as usual. - So, Vibs. - Yes. Did you have fun? Yeah. It was nice. I had fun. This is the kind of stuff people like. You need to run the house as well. Need to balance things. Here we are. Your stop. Get down. - Drop her off first. - Ok. If you say so. I don't know Mastana-- "I will never leave, stay single all my life." "There is no home except Lahore." Fantastic! He who has not seen Lahore, has not lived. There's food. Take it yourself. I've eaten. Add water at least. Talked to Jeeta about the show? It's on the 20th. There's time. You always welcome trouble. You know I have another show on the 20th. - You never get it right. - Forget it, mother. I'll manage. No one's interested in your kind of songs anymore. You idiot! Have you gulped your manners with the booze? Jeeta asked me directly. Mother... ...If I don't go either, we'll be done for. Do what you want. Just give me my share. A skirt, pant or a lungi? What is she wearing? You have a baughty sight. Is she a foreigner? Should I whistle? No, just wink. Let that be. Let's start. Presenting... Jugni. You forgot again. What are you doin? One day you'll know the value of these songs. Where's the book? The book? This boy is blessed. But he just won't sing the old songs. Mr. "Up to date"! Ask him for a modern song. Let it be. I'll start. "My Guru is my heart." "My Guru is my heart." "It orders and I follow." "It orders and I follow." "I bow to zest and zeal." "I bow to zest and zeal." "For everything." "For everything." Excellent. Fantastic. "A piggybank of fun and games." "A piggybank of fun and games." "That grows by the day." "Woman, she's not a flute of sorrow." "She's celebration, she's a song, she's a dance." "She's celebration, she's a song, she's a dance." "She's celebration, she's a song, she's a dance." "The unstruck sound resonates." "The unstruck sound resonates." "Warming every corner of the heart." "Growing by the day." "Warming every corner of the heart." "Lighting up every nook." "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Lighting up every nook." "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Lighting up every nook." "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Woman, everywhere she steps." Superb! Fantastic! Way to go! Saroop, shall we? Not a problem. "My Guru is my heart." "It orders and I follow." Sorry, cut. It's not the same. Let's make tea. For energy? Booze is for energy. Just a second! Make tea. Should I take yours off too? Yes. Can't breathe. "My Guru is my heart." Exactly. This is what I wanted. Is it? On your left is the sad and forlorn one. On your right is the happy one. So beautiful. A photo? One more. Let's take one together. Come on. That's nice. Can I ask you something? Do city people ask before asking? - How did you and Preeto meet? - Alcohol. Alcohol? How? This is what happened. It was the peak of winter and I was all set. Meaning drunk. When I'm drunk, I'm a lion. I climbed to the terrace to declare my love. Then got confused. Were the flowers marigolds or roses? Flowers? Yes. The quilts have printed flowers. Then? - And then the story turns. - I know that. A twist in the tale. Yes. Preeto was elsewhere and I got under the wrong quilt. Would you believe it. Rano's aunt was sleeping with her slippers on. I shouted, and so she did too. I am serious. Too funny. So nice. Show me. Just a second. Nice. Jaildar Singh Jaili requests a song by Bibi Saroop. Here it is, Mr. Jaildaar. Your song is finally playing. Vibo! Hurry! Come up. What is it? My song. "It shouts from inside of my shirt." "Oh my style!" "They letch at me, from every corner." "Oh my buxom figure." "Look into my eyes." "Don't you dare look away." "If you sit up close so close..." "...Then why just use your hands?" "Both the flowers are in bloom." "Can't hold on any more." "Oh my buxom figure." "Oh my buxom figure." "Oh my buxom figure." "Catch a glimpse of my expensive underwear." Get lost! - Come on, Preeto. - No. She's a visitor. She will be gone tomorrow. - Why are you sulking? - Because I like it. Oh my love. - What else do you like? - I don't like her. That's it. Why are you laughing? I'm not going to marry her. Don't even try. I'll teach you a lesson. Get it? Give me a chance. I'll do anything for you. Marry me! Just say yes. "Do I deserve your taunts?" "When I have fought the whole world for you." I like the sound of the click. But this time it went with the click, right? Yes! With the click, but-- I don't know. When you sing without the mic, it's magical. I don't know what happens with the mic on. Vibs. I have an idea. - Want to hear it? - Tell me. We'll have to shift focus. Whenever I'm in trouble... ...I go to a Sufi saint's shrine. The one who grants all wishes. Let's go. It's something else. Sounds very interesting. How far is it? - It isn't that far - "It isnt that far." I mean, we just have to walk a little. You are truely mad. Let's go. Let's just do it. Forget it. I can't. You go. There you go again! That's just me. My brother's getting married. I can't. Brother? He is your aunt's sister's sister-in-law's son. A relationship as distant as the road to heaven. He's still my brother. I have to go. You should be grateful that I'm asking. And you are throwing tantrums. I'm done with this. I'm not stopping you. Do what you want. You can't stop me. You're not the Government. I'll do as I please. I'm done. I'm out of here. Hello, Mr. Bhatti! Stop! Quick. Please stop! Let's move! It's so crowded. Just wait and watch. "I have sold my heart." "For just one glimpse of you." "Given up the world." Aren't you Master Mastana? Hello. Please sit. Get up! We must respect artists. Please sit. Terrific. Your songs are terrific. Mastana. Can we hear 'Dil Ke Sang'? It's so good. "Take my liver and kidney free with my heart." "Take me to Vancouver or Sydney." "Take my liver and kidney free with my heart." "Take me to Vancouver or Sydney." "Love is the cream on top of sweet buttermilk." "Take as much as you want." Almost there. Just another kilo. - A kilo? - A kilometre. Long journeys should be measured in weight. No, I can't. It's too far. What are you doing? Let's go. It's not far. "You shine in every corner." "Your radiance omnipresent." "Your radiance omnipresent." "Give us a glance of your kindness." "My bond with you is unseen." "My bond with you is unseen." "My innocence needs your guidance." "My bond with you is unseen." "My bond with you is unseen." "My bond with you is unseen." "My innocence needs your guidance." "My bond with you is unseen." "You are the cause, you the start." "You are the cause, you the start. This life is your gift." "The melodies, the fairs, are all your kindness." "The eve is yours, the morning too." "The eve is yours, the morning too." "You are the only teacher." "Nature, it shines by your light." "You are the one, you are all." "Every nook reflects your glory." "Every nook reflects your glory." "Every face shines with your light." "Every face shines with your light." "Give us a glance of your kindness." "I bow to you, almighty." "My bond with you unseen." "My bond with you unseen." "My innocence needs your guidance." "My bond with you unseen." "My bond with you unseen." "My bond with you unseen." "My innocence needs your guidance." "My bond with you unseen." "My bond with you unseen." "My bond with you unseen." "My innocence needs your guidance." "My bond with you unseen." "My bond with you unseen." "My bond with you unseen." "My bond with you unseen." "My innocence needs your guidance." God bless you. - How much longer? - Only half an hour. Half an hour? Smells like it's done. Good music and good food require patience. My specialty. All the way from Delhi to Rajasthan. Really? You get its real flavour with 'Gulabo Gulfam'. - Gulabo Gulfam? - Gulabo, she's my life. - And Gulfam? - Gulfam is her status. Wow! Preeto is special. Gulabo too. You're fast! You misunderstand. Gulabo is a labour of love. She needs care and patience. Raisins, nuts and God knows what all she's made of. Her face glows. I must meet Gulabo. Forget it, I was just talking. I need this glow too. We won't eat without Gulabo. Don't get emotional. Just a second. There isn't a drink that I haven't tried. I can hold my drink. I drink a lot. Come on. Please let's just do it. Be warned. Not everyone can handle her. - So be it. - Sure? So be it. Please. What? Come on. - Let me see. - Forget it. Let go. Pure unadulterated Gulabo. Oh yeah! "Don't stop me O cleric, Let me follow my calling." Lovely. That was my favourite Bulle Shah verse. My father used to listen to Pathaniya Khan's songs. "Don't stop me O cleric." "Let me follow my calling." "Let me follow my calling and go to the courtesan's abode." "To be a courtesan will not demean me. Let me dance to lure my lover." I love this. This is love, Mastana. An intangible thread that gets tied. Nothing else matters. To become a courtesan is fine. Do you think all legendary lovers loved like this? Yes. 100 percent. They were amazing examples. Unique people, unique love. Mad love. Vibs. If you ask me, music is love too. Love of another world. Absolutely! Love of another world. I love that. Love. "These questions drifting on the silence." "Unanswered, gliding on the wind that leads them away." "Leads them away." "These feelings riding on the dunes of sand." "In the very dreams that I don't understand, I will one day." "I will one day." "We're too many worlds away, too many worlds away." "Don't stop me." "Don't stop me." "Don't stop me O cleric, let me follow my calling." "Don't stop me O cleric, let me follow my calling." "Don't stop me." "Don't stop me." "Don't stop me O cleric, let me follow my calling." "Don't stop me O cleric, let me follow my calling." "Let me follow my calling and go to the courtesan's abode." "Don't stop me O cleric, let me follow my calling." "Don't stop me O cleric, let me follow my calling." "Like a ray of light in my darkest night." "Do we let it shine one day." "We're too many worlds away." "This is the moment of love." "This is the moment of love." "Love is all there is. "Love wraps the soul." "Love wraps the soul." "And the joy is boundless." "Every moment." "Of our meeting, is celebration." "A thousand lamps light the heart." "And set every bit of me aflame." "And set every bit of me aflame." "And set every bit of me aflame." "And set every bit of me aflame." "Don't stop me O cleric, let me follow my calling." "Don't stop me O cleric, let me follow my calling." "These questions drifting on the silence." "Unanswered, gliding on the wind." "Don't stop me O cleric, let me follow my calling." "Don't stop me O cleric, let me follow my calling." "Let me follow my calling and change my faith if I must." "Change my faith if I must and go to the courtesan's abode." "To be a courtesan will not demean me." "Let me dance to lure my lover." "Let me dance to lure my lover." "Let me dance to lure my lover." Mastana? Mastana? Mastan! Where to, brother? All right, Romeo, have it your way. Sir. Which way to Morinda? Excuse me. Sir. Morinda? That way. You're alone? Where's Mastana? I don't know. He didn't come with you? How did you get back? Alone. - What happened? - Nothing. I woke up in the morning, he wasn't there. Just like that? He left you alone? I made my way back. Alone. His damn phone is off too. I've been trying since morning. Nothing! There is a limit. Did he drink Gulabo? - Yeah, we did. - We? You mean both of you? A little. Just let him come back. Let me know if you need anything. Ok? You can't have everything, your own way. Let me sleep. I am sorry Sid. Vibhavari, please. Let's not fight, please baby. Don't. Let me sleep. Please. What the hell! - What happened? Where were you? - May I come in? Tell me where were you? And what made you disappear? Forgive me. Please don't do that. Get up! Get up, please. It's not your fault. - My brain shut down. - That's ridiculous. -You disappeared. - Forgive me. - Ok. What are you apologizing for? - Everything. No. Apologize only for leaving me there. - I was scared. - For that too. That's it. Everything else... ..Is fine. I mean... yes, it's ok. So you aren't angry? I'm very angry that you left me there. But that's it. Nothing else. Sorry. I should not have left you alone. Sorry. Say it again. Sorry. Going to Preeto? What is wrong with you? You left her alone in the jungle? Have you gone mad? Say something. Why are you silent? Can I get a word in? Here. Go on. I had some urgent work. Did your diamond get stolen? Why did you run away? You won't understand. I will, because I'm the one asking. Tell me. I asked you to come along but you didn't. Did you? Look at me. Don't look away. Look into my eyes. What happened? What could have happened? We spent some time there and came back. What else? That's it? - Nothing happened, right? - Like what? She seduced you, right? I saw through her at first glance. I knew she would do it. Don't talk rubbish. - Tell me the truth. What happened? - Nothing. But now it will. And in full glory. - You just try. - Forget it. I will show you! I swear. "Do I deserve your taunts?" "When I have fought the whole world for you." Hello. Hi Sid. How are you? Fine. And you? I'm fine too. Where are you? In a village in Punjab, Hassanpur. A little time apart will be good for us. Don't you think? Very thoughtful of you, Vibs. I don't need relationship advice over the phone. Anything else? Actually I'm out of cash. How much do you need? 7,000 should do. I'll transfer 10,000. Withdraw it from an ATM. Thank you Sid. You're the best. Bye then. Bye. What happened, son? Tell me. A mother can tell. Let it be, mother. I'll make tea. "The wanderer lies, says Heer." "No one can set it right again." "I searched far and wide and never found." "Anyone who can bring back the ones who are gone." "Who can bring back the ones who are gone." Did you talk to Preeto? Let's stop for today. You sang beautifully. What's wrong, Mastana? Not well. Why do Punjabi love stories have sad endings? Heer-Ranjha, Sassi-Punnu, Sohni-Mahiwal. Why didn't the lovers end up together? There's a bitter-sweet joy in not ending up together. Really? I don't agree. Ending up together is just ecstasy. The village paths are slippery. One could fall. What is this? Rehearsing to leave? Leaving for real. Wait a second. - Did someone say something? - No. What would anyone say? Just a minute. What are you doing Mastana? See, this is it, all this passion, I can't-- You, Bibi, it's very addictive. I'm getting too attached. Mastana! I have to go back to Mumbai. All these recordings... ...I have to work on them. I have to go. Help me pack, please. That one. Very nice. Just a minute. I must talk to you. If you could arrange some money. Don't worry. I'll send some, once I am back. All films have budgets. Trust me. I understand. Something to manage now? You know our circumstances. I understand. Please keep 2000 for now. I'll send more later, please. Make it 5000. And the rest later. Keep 4,000. I'll need some for the journey. Don't worry I'll send more for sure. All right. It was really nice. Take care. Come back soon. Goodbye, Babaji. Leaving empty-handed? You didn't hear my song. I'm taking so much. Thank you. I'll be back soon. God bless you. She'll never change. Eventually, she did ask for money. She's shameless. Don't say that. She's your mother. I have to send money anyway. Once I'm back-- The money will come, but when will you? Before I do, your songs will on the big screen. A crowd of fans will then chase you. I'll be among them shouting... "Mastana-ji, autograph please!" - Forget it. Let's go. - You're going? - Yes, for now. I won't say goodbye. - I have a gift for you. - I didn't get you anything. That's ok. Vibs, I want to say something Mastana. Bye. Take care. I'm going to call you. "These questions drifting on the silence." "Don't stop me." "Don't stop me." "Unanswered, gliding on the wind." "Don't stop me O cleric, let me follow my calling." "Dreams that I don't understand." "Let me follow my calling and go to the courtesan's abode." "Too many worlds away." "Let me dance to lure my lover." "Let me dance to lure my lover." "Let me dance to lure my lover." Hey! Hey Sid. So, how was it? Great. You have to listen to what I got. Now? One sec. Mastana, hi. I'm here. The train was a little late, just six hours. Shall I call you in a bit? Ok, bye. - What happened? - Nothing. Sid. Wait. I can't. What? What the hell, Vibs! I'm really sorry. What's your problem? - I... - what? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? You will have to tell me. I met someone. Meaning? You're hurting me Sidharth. - You won't understand. - What won't I understand? What are you doing? Oh I get it. I get it. You met someone on this mad trip of yours. And you screwed him, right? - Shut up, Sidharth. - I should shut up? Why didn't you stay there? Why come back to my house? It's my house too. We pay joint EMIs, remember? How many did you pay? Who paid the down payment? Let's not even go there, all right? - You're horrible, Sidharth. - You're an angel, right? Please just go. I'm sorry. You have no right to tell me to leave my own home. - If you want to, you go. - Yeah, fine. I will. What the-- Met someone! - What's happened? - Nothing. Show me. - You burnt your hand? - No, it's fine. Shut up, Vibs. Did I ask you? Come here. Come here. Watch it. One minute. Show me. Hey. Hey, Vibs. What's the problem? Look... ...We won't stay together, if you don't want to. Please-- Please don't cry. Please tell me what's going on. I'm your friend too. What's going on, please tell me. I don't know Sid. I... ...I can't work. I'm really confused Sid. What? - About work? - About everything. I just don't know. I'm right here. We're friends, even if there's no love. Sid, no. I feel damn guilty, Sid. No. Don't. I need us, Vibs. If not as lovers, then as friends. I need us. Yeah. - Scared? Of me? - Of course not. Then? Let me sleep. She's gone. Now there's only me. Let's start over. Go away. Come back, Mastana. Leave. She took what she wanted and left. You're just being an idiot. You and your nonsense! Shut up or-- Or what? You'll hit me? Show me. You think she loves you? She's just using you. You're jealous. Jealous! Yeah, right. Keep dreaming, Romeo. Preeto! Wait! Preeto! Wait! Mind your language. I don't owe you an answer. I'm not doing the show. Get someone else. He's refused four shows and embarassed me. Thinks he's Michael Jackson. I can take anything, but if he insults my sister... ...I'll stuff his pants with red chillies. Why red! Green chillies. Down the second peg, hurry. Yes Preeto? I'm not coming home tonight. This is war. This generation is hot-blooded. He'll come around. He'll be back on track in two days. I had to suffer his moods and hear people abuse us. On top of that, he treats Preeto so badly.The Prince! Yes? This is Jeeta the Emotional. Mastana? He's dead. Yeah, very sad. Don't cry on the phone, come home, we'll cry together. There's a show in two days. We have to sing together. No. Why? Not in the mood. The Mumbai girl has taken your mood away? Travellers can't be friends. They have their fun and leave. The shows are our bread and butter. We must respect them. Hello. It's Mastana. - How are you? - I'm all right. And you? A little busy. Where are you? I'm just... - ...Waiting - For? You. I mean the album, the film. That's the only way forward. I know, of course. - How's the work going? - A bit slow. Don't worry. You have God's blessings. You'll get it. Thank you Mastana. I'm glad that you called. Things might move soon. That's great. - Shall I hang up? - Sure. Take care. You too. Take care. Bye. Bye. "A piggybank of fun and games." "A piggybank of fun and games." "It grows by the day." "Woman, she's not a flute of sorrow." "She's celebration, she's song, she's dance." "She's celebration, she's song, she's dance." "The unstruck sound resonates." "The unstruck sound resonates." "Warming every corner of the heart." "It grows by the day." "Warming every corner of the heart." "Lighting up every nook." "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Lighting up every nook." "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Lighting up every nook." "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Woman, everywhere she steps." Oh, guys That was superb. I love it, Vibs. Who's the singer? Mastana. He lives in a village near Jalandhar. Sings at local concerts. I think we'll get the 'Best Music' award. Wow. Get on with it. Let's meet when it's done. Nishant, I need to talk about their fees. Meghna. She's the EP. Talk to her. Ok. I didn't fix the fees. Tell me the budget and I'll tell them. There is no budget. You'll have to manage on your own. That's not possible. There is always a budget for singers. Nishant? He's not an established singer. His name adds no value. Of course he does. The music is better because of his voice. The film will have an edge, Nishant. Look... ...She's right, Meghna. Fair enough he isn't established, so pay him accordingly. But he must be paid. Let me see what I can do. The film is over budget, just like your last one. Yes, boss. Guys, I got to go. Great work! Keep it up. See you soon. Call us. Bloody misers! Blood suckers. "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Woman, everywhere she steps." Take it easy guys. Take it easy. One minute. Mastana. - Saw the film? - It's fantastic! Top of the class! You've done wonders. It's housefull. Everyone's talking about the music. Many congratulations to you and to Bibi. You've worked magic. Congratulations to you! God bless you. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Vibs. - I thought of coming to Mumbai. - Really? You want to? My friends say I that might get a break there. It's not that easy to get noticed. It's tough. Ask me, it hasn't been easy. I get it. Ok, just come. We'll see. Experience Mumbai for yourself. Luck may be on your side. Shall I bring Gulabo? She'll set the mood. Shut up, Mastana. Consider me there. Mumbai! - Have you gone crazy, Mastana? - Mastana was born crazy. All of India is listening to Mastana's songs... ...On a really big screen. What about my songs? You can hear them too. But only after your ears are cleaned out. I'll go and see for myself. Grandfather? - I need your blessings. I'm off. - Where to? - Mumbai, where else? - Forget it. Mumbai is tough. No one's going anywhere. Home is home. You look after it. The world is waiting and you're delaying me. I'm going. Full stop. No one is going anywhere. Stop! Give him your blessings. He might achieve something. Go on, son. You look familiar. You're in that popular soap, right? Mastana. Here I am. Direct telecast. How are you? - How are you? - Good. Come on in. Sid, Mastana. Mastana, Sid. Come. - Very nice. - Thanks. We don't have homes like yours, so you'll have to sleep in the hall. Yeah, it's great. And the bathroom. Use this one. Hungry? There's some bagels. Bagels? Bibi was furious. She said, "I'll go and see for myself." She hit me with a potato-- - Hi, dinner? - I've eaten. You-- It's late. I'll make your bed. There's food in the fridge if you get hungry. This side. Goodnight. "It grows by the day." "Warming every corner of the heart." "Lighting up every nook." "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Lighting up every nook." "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Lighting up every nook." "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Woman, everywhere she steps." What a voice! Excellent! What a find! All your songs will be hits. Excellent! Who else is there? There's no one else. Cheers. Here... It costs 15 million to produce an album. This is Swaang, famous music director. Right... I might get a break. I've come from so far. Why not? You're a great singer. Mail me a CD, I will definitely check it out. Ok? There's no one else in the industry right now. What about that guy? Not a chance, copycats don't last. The next one is my mother's favourite. Listen carefully. "Do I deserve your taunts?" Wonderful. I'll be back. Hear this line. Coming. "When I have fought the whole world for you." "Do I deserve your taunts?" "When I have fought the whole world for you." Mastana, one minute. Guys. This is not some CD playing. An artist is performing, putting in so much effort for you. If you are not interested, please leave. Just leave. Mastana. Don't lose heart. People are like that in this industry. Fake. I can see that. Everyone says "Leave me a CD," and I do. No one wants to hear me face-to-face. They won't listen to the CD either. No one gives a damn. Mastana. You wanted to watch a shoot, right? Yes. We can go tomorrow. Ok. Thank you. What do you think of Vibs? What do you mean? - Well, what do you think of her? - I don't get it. Her looks, voice, music? What do you think? She's wonderful. Why do you ask? We're getting married, that's why. What do you think? It's up to you two. What can I say? I'm asking your opinion. You know best. You know her well, don't you? You spent a lot of time together. I-- How well do you know her? Here we are. Sir. Did you always sleep in separate rooms? Watch it! Don't forget you're in my house. I'm staying in Vibs house. And thank you for taking me to the shoot. In English. I didn't know that you liked the sea that much. I've only seen it in the movies. By the way, the cheques are ready. It's not much. I tried but couldn't do more. You've done so much already. You got me here. Vibs. Vibs. Preeto and me-- It's not about Preeto. - You and Sid. - It's not about Sid either. Then? About what happened that night. It just happened. It was true, it was pure. Let's leave it at that. I don't want to be the villain in this love story and break your heart. I like you too much for that. Get it? Why would you break my heart? Because love is not like the one in the folk tales. Or maybe it is. There's a bitter-sweet joy in not ending up together. The truth is that we live in very diferent worlds. And Preeto truly loves you. Even when she's angry, she only wants you. "O lord you are my guide." "O lord you are my guide." "O lord you are my guide." "O lord you are my guide." "I bow to your eternal kindness." "You will stand by me on judgement day." "You will stand by me on judgement day." "I bow to you, the creator." The audience is restless. Where's Jeeta? He requested to say that he's dead. Good evening, folks. The award for Best Music goes to... ...Vibhavari, for the film Dhun. "Lighting up every nook." "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Lighting up every nook." "Woman, everywhere she steps." "Lighting up every nook." It's my first film so I'm not sure if I should be happy or nervous. I want to thank my director, Nishant. My producers and my parents. And Mastana. None of this would've been possible... ...without artists like Bibi Saroop and you. Songs come and go. It's important. I hope the industry will give these artists their due respect. Sid, my friend, thank you for always standing by this mad woman. Always, thank you. Calm down. Calm down. Mastana. ...The 'Jugni' song in your film was great. Sing it again, please. Really? Sure. Traditional compositions are the best. They have the aroma of the soil. Shall we? Sid. Congratulations. - Sid, I-- - I saw it on TV. I really meant what I said. And I wanted to-- - I was thinking-- You go first. Sid I'm moving out. What? I got my cheque. It isn't much, but enough to get a small place. And hopefully, I'll manage the rent. As usual. You only think about yourself. Not this time, Sid. I've depended on you far too much. I don't want to any more. And frankly, I think it's better for us both. You'll decide what's good for me? No, you will. Sid, I feel I'm just a habit to you. And you'll realize that when I go. Think about yourself Vibs. I can take care of myself. Where did you get my number? From Vibs? Yes, I sang it. Sing in a film? In Mumbai? I'll be there. Give me your dates. Yes. I'm free. I will be there. For a film? Of course. Of course. At noon? Ok, bye. That's great, Mastana. You must go. And you? Come with me? You can't be with the tuneless, can you? Go. God bless you. "Do I deserve your taunts?" "When I have fought the whole world for you." - Vibs. - Mastana. I was about to call you. And I did instead. How are you? - I am coming to Mumbai. - Really? They called you? - Yeah. How are you? - Good. I'm working on a new film in Himachal. Amazing. I'm going there and you're coming here. Perhaps we'll meet somewhere in the middle. Maybe on a beach. Take care, brother. I'll call you. "Whether you reply or not." "I will keep calling out to you." "I will cry in front of you." "I'll tell you what I am feeling." "I have sold my heart." "I have sold my heart." "I have sold my heart." "For just a glimpse of you." "I have sold my heart." "For just one glimpse of you." "I have given up the world." "I have given up the world." "For this love alone." "I have given up the world." "For this love alone." "I have sold my heart." "People build cages..." "...Where they lock their lover." "People build cages..." "...Where they lock their lover." "My head is yours to cut." "My head is yours to cut." "Just for a meeting with you." "I have sold my heart."
