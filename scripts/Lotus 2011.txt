News, but not THE news. He hid himself from the outside world. Neighbors said he wasn't leaving his house anymore. His motives are a matter of speculation. There you are. Sorry.

But I don't. That's our music. - That's why... Then I won't be able to listen to it ever again, will I? Fine. Just play some James Last then. I'll finally be able to put on some make-up again. Why don't you let me do it? Honey... Come on. Careful. Is it working? Already? Yes, it's working. And? And? - Well... How was your week? - Fine. Yoram and Tara came by. They send their love. Oh, and I went to Aix-la-Chapelle for two days. Aix-la-Chapelle? - Crazy, isn't it? I've always wanted to go there. - Why not today? I hopped on the train and stayed at a Bed & Breakfast. And? - Dullsville. Incredibly boring city. But now I know, at least. Why Aix-la-Chapelle of all places? - Crazy, isn't it? I had to think hard why I wanted to go there in the first place. It has to go on the bottom shelf. The bottom shelf. Sorry, you're right. - So do it then. Plan a weekend away with hubby. Make time for each other. What do you want? - What did you say? Exactly. A break. Nice and quiet. This weekend? We'll be able to make it. Yes, I forgot. Two beers, please. - I'll have a cola. A beer and a cola. - Got it. Oh, he'd love it. Yes, of course. What are you looking for? Eye... coloring thing. - Oh, your mascara. Here you go. You know what it is? Quit the game while you're ahead. If you don't work the ball properly and you're in your team's way, get out. True or not? Right? Otherwise you just sit at the sideline. Real men aren't interested in balls. - But she is. Throw it in, man. - I want a headshot. What happened to your cast? - Allowed to come off sooner. Takes some getting used to, or not? - It's OK. Want something to drink? - Yes, nice. Go get it yourself. Hot stuff. Full of herself. - Just hormones. Give me your cell phone for a minute. The one I gave you. When you need me, call me. Press A. Not short. Keep pressing it. MOM You never called me that. Did you get it? The A is a speed dial. If something is up and you want to talk to me press that speed dial. Do you get it? - Yes, I'm not stupid. When I want to talk you, I press the speed dial. Are you ready? Hey, son. What have you got there? It's nice. Come on in. Mom's waiting for you. Yes, it works. Look who's here. Hello, sweetheart. You look great. MAKE A CHOICE Sultry Summer Sales are on again. Now on the fourth floor. Super special offers on all swimwear. Jet, let me at least take you home. Please, you have to stay away from me. - I can't just let you go like this. When you find me tomorrow, they'll investigate. You'll have enough problems. - What will happen? A few months in jail? - The whole inheritance gone. I don't care about a few lousy pennies. I was only ever able to give you those few lousy pennies. I'm not very good at this. You're it. I'll get you. SCHERZO Hey, sweetie. Thank you. Take it easy, guys, careful with that ice cream. I'm Messi. You can't get me. You're it. You're it. - You're it. What's wrong? - Kale? It's our favorite food. - It's summertime. So what? We like it. Perhaps you can tell a nice story. About kale. A long, long time ago I went skating... ...when I suddenly heard a loud crack. - That was dad. Quiet. Mom's telling the story. I was flabbergasted and looked down at the ice. Well... ...eventually he went through the ice as well. After that, we ate kale. No, no, no. - You're skipping a big part. You always tell it differently. Last time you did. It's with the ambulance, the fire truck, the horse blanket. You were sitting together on the couch drinking whisky and then... Sorry. Hey, I discovered something new. The neighbor's dog can buy groceries. With a basket in his mouth and a shopping list... ...he goes to the greengrocer and the butcher. If he mixes them up... ...the greengrocer just sends him on to the butcher. Isn't that funny? He even waits his turn. I find it a strange story. I'm sorry, but kale needs to be mashed with potatoes. Make a rocket. - You can't. Yes, I can. Attack! Shall we do something together? - Yes. You guys pick something. Put it in the garage. That will be three euro. Bennie? Coming too? - Yes. You've been run over. Come on, guys. Good. - Turn. Turn? - Yes. Take your time. Use your strength well. Take your time. Ready. Go. Come on. Everything. Come on. Everything. You want to get back in that chair. That's it. Take a break. Try to recover. Take your time. Turn into the chair in a while. Lift to here. My hand is stuck. - Pull. God damn it. Ting, tang, the bogeyman. - Oh no, a frog is eating me. If you want a boy so badly, here's one. - Let's have it. I've got one... You have a turn. - I didn't give it to you, but... Lynn, please. - Come on. I don't fight with stupid girls. - Guys, dad is going to tell a story. Dad? - Nice, right? He can't tell stories. - He's very good at it. Go sit over there and put the puppets down. Dad will go into the puppet theater and we'll have a good laugh again. I wonder what he's going to tell. - So do I. Isn't this fun, guys? - Yes. Is it going to start soon? - I think so. Dad has to pick out a puppet. Right, Ben? - A clown, for instance. Couldn't he better... Something like that. - Hello. When is it going to start? Do you know the story of Peter and the wolf? Do we want to hear it again? - Yes. All right. Go ahead, Bennie. Hi, Wolf, aren't you going to say 'hi' first? I think he's asleep. When is it going to start? - Now what? Dad is going outside for a while. - Why? You didn't even tell a story. The mother ship. It's boring without you. Did you forget? Something like that. You're hopeless. - As if you're such a star. Are you going to the stadium tomorrow? - Of course. What did you think? It will be a chaos. Are you ready for that? It's perfect. Up front in the wheelchair section. Hatred, envy, jealous looks. I can recommend it to everyone. You could have told me you're able to look that beautiful. I poured out my whole life to you. Which you don't do to beautiful women? No. Why not? Don't know. I feel like laughing. Yuck, it's mineral water. All newspapers led with the story of the day... ...that started so festively and ended so badly. Mom. Hi, honey. Hey, sweetie. Hello. You smell. - What? Me? Have you been smoking? - Silly. I stopped smoking. Are you all right? This place looks different. It's not cozy anymore. And a lot more expensive. No vegetarian egg rolls. - What's wrong with you? You always want them, don't you? - You're whining. It's not the first time I whine. - Yes, it is. I've never heard you complain about anything. You say that as if I don't have a life. - Not at all. Yes, you do. Someone who never complains is not alive. I've no idea what you mean. - I don't like this conversation. You're doing it again. Yes. Shall we talk about something else? Are you sure you're all right? - That's what I said, didn't I? Nice beer. I thought I'd invite the whole center and two might show up. Maybe three. Mikey. Hey, there are girls and free beer. This one's for you. Hey Mike, get over here. He got you a stripper. - Jerk. I'm just a good friend. Cheers. Are you OK? Just... wait. Take it easy. Is this your first time? What? - This is not the place to be subtle... ...but 'Is this your first time?' Do you know the story of Peter and the wolf? No, I don't. Neither do I. Not anymore. I used to know it by heart, but today it seems to be lost. Now that's a good line. You've got a nice smile. Bullshit. - No, I'm serious. Shall we? - Are we in a hurry? Why are you here, anyway? - Same reason as you. I doubt that. Is today your wedding anniversary as well? No. I'm just here for a fuck. That will do. So shall we? Come. Isn't that beautiful? Let's go. I'll wait outside. I saw a sparrow that was a meter and a half tall. Did you? Do you know what he said? - Well? CHIRP. Sorry. Now you're going to tell me what's going on. Never mind. - No, I won't. I'm staying here until you tell me what's going on. You would have done it all completely differently. I'm so proud of you. Mom, what are you doing? - It's fine. Stupid cow. Wubbe? Since when do you smoke? I found it. - Who gave it to you? Got it from Geert Wiebe. There you go. Take it. Geert Wubbe. You don't mind me smoking? No. You're old enough to decide that for yourself. I think so too. I took one of your cigars as well. Well, well. From the box? - From her box. Carla's box. - From her slit. They're still from Christmas. - From her slit. A cigar from Carla's slit. So, mister, you pinched a cigar from Carla? Was it good? - Yes. No. It was disgusting. Those things are no good anymore. - They're frowzy. What are they? Frowzy? Where's mom's mug? Which mug? Mom's mug is gone. The mug with the ear. I dropped it. - The mug. Dad dropped it. - The mug with the ear. It broke when it fell on the floor. What do you mean, sweetie. - Your mug. Mom's mug with the ear is gone. It's broken. - What's mom to drink coffee out of? Mom doesn't need coffee. - You do. You do. You do. We have to drink coffee. Happy? Are you sabotaging things on purpose? - I just left it in the dishwasher. Great. Madam has a dishwasher. Isn't life going fast enough? Just leave him be. ...dropped it. Thanks. Guys... Dear Mike... Come and join me. Because you won't miss us, but we will miss you, of course... ...we had this... ...this made for you. There you go. Open it, Mike. Open it, Mike. Come on. Beautiful, right? I don't know what to say, guys. - Speech. It's awesome that you all showed up. But do you really think I'm going to hang this up at home? I've been stuck with you for 16 weeks. With your disfigurements. With your flaws and your lousy moods. He's talking about you. - Yeah, right. I thank God on my knees I'm allowed to leave. You are... we're not friends. I don't want to be reminded of you. That's it for today's festivities, guys. What's wrong? What's wrong? - It's just my stomach. Hold on. - From time to time... Breathe in. Breathe out. Again. In. Out. That's better. Again. Hold on. Your belly, my hand. Slower, if you can. Better? - Yes, it's OK. It's subsiding. What else can you do with those hands? ...it seems to be more broadly represented in our society nowadays... ...many Dutch people identlfy themselves with the perpetrator... ADAGIETTO UNIVERSITY OF BRUSSELS G.J. BRINK That girl... ...how old would she be? Did you see that dress? So cheerful. Hi, I'm here. Steintje, are you there? - Yes. But I have no picture. Do you see me? - Hang on. Nothing is working here. How? - What? Sorry. Go ahead. How are you? - Fine. Fine and you? - Just great. It's very exciting here. It'sjust one big mess. How about you? - Exciting as well. I miss you though. What did you say? Never mind. Any hot chicks over there? Come on! No, Steintje. Six months and then it will all be over. By the way, you'd enjoy this. The whole group is going on a field trip soon... Dave. Wait a minute. Nothing is working here. Say something. Dave? You're not going to jump, are you? - Me? No. Not me. - That's good. It's a long way, you know. - What? And there's a current. You'll be in Hoek van Holland in no time. I live over there, so I have a front row seat of the jumpers. Does it happen a lot? - Not really. Would you like a beer? - Pardon? Would you like a beer? Right now? - Look, I have beer. Nice. Where would you jump if you? Good question. Off a crane, I think. - They're not easy to get on to. They are. I worked there myself. Want to see it? What? - Let's go for a ride. Right now? - I can show you if you like. Want to see it? Coming? Are you OK? I'm just going to... Hey little Islamb, move it. - You move it. Want a beer? - Beer. Give me a hand Islame. - Give me a hand... It's beautiful. No, don't do that. That ruins it. The world down there should stay down there. Full moon, right? Do you think this is high enough? - Absolutely. You just have to aim carefully. cannonball. Well, decided to come after all? Sorry. - It's your party. All those people... - You won't see them anymore. Right? Remember Bob? Police agent Bob. - Everyone cried when he left. You're not like Bob. Bob hanged himself. From an IKEA hanging dryer. - Moron. Good thing Norwegians don't know anything about durability. Swedish. IKEA is Swedish. But you have someone at home, right? Yes. I haven't seen your wife here that often. Girlfriend. No. She's not into this whole scene. I get that. I was only focusing on leaving. But she's coming tomorrow. Who? - My girlfriend. She'll be picking me up. I'm tired. I'm going to sleep. Since when do you sleep at night? Since tomorrow. HICHAM SLEEPS HERE HE'LL BE BACK TOMORROW! GOOD M... Don't. Wubbe is awake. Wubbe? - Yes.

It's good to finally take the time for things like that again. Don't. You see something of the world. When someone has a dream, Wubbe, you have to go for it. You really have to fight for that dream. One for all and all for one. If people really love each other that much, they have to fight. If love is so... - Enough. Sorry, sweetheart. Come here. - No. No. What? You need a shave. Yes, I need a shave. I need a shave too. Yes, you have stubble too. I've seen razors. Five euro. Why do you always start here when you shave? And not here? I don't know. - Why always here?

Act like a normal child. - Normal child. Act normal. I don't think the neighbor even has a dog. And I think you should go to sleep. Good night. If there's anyone who abandoned us it's you. You don't do nothing anymore. Nothing at all. I love that child very much, but I also want other things. I want to travel, enjoy myself, I want sex. Is this all there is for you? Is it? Well, not for me. Not for me. What do you want? We were going to go to Capri. We were maybe going to buy a boat. We were... I really want... This isn't the end yet, is it?
