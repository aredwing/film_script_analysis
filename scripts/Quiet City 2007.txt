Do you know where that is? Am I going the right way? Um...what diner? Um...hang on. I wrote it down somewhere. Uh, Daisy's? Oh, yeah. You know where it is? Yeah. OK, so what should I do? Uh...OK. Um, basically, um, OK, go out this exit, go to your right, and then take the left staircase out to the floor level. Um, and then, OK, you're going to get out and go left on the street right there. So l-- This street right here. So I take a left when I go out to the street? Yeah, go left, go left out of the station, left on the street, and then go, like, two blocks up, and then, um... what do you see over there? I'm trying to think. Um... Thanks for walking with me. It's really nice of you. Yeah, no problem. Kind of a bad situation right now. My friend-- I should have known. It's typical of my friend, Samantha. She, um... last I heard from her was on this message where she said she had lost her phone charger. And the only way I knew where to go was that she left me that message saying to meet at the diner, so otherwise I would be... I don't know what I would do. Really? Yeah. That sucks. Yeah. It does. But anyway, she's really irresponsible, and, like, she's that kind of person where if you want to hang out at, like, 8:00 at night or something, you should probably tell her to get ready around 7:00 because just give her an hour extra because she's going to be late anyway. Then she'd still be late even if you did that, you know? Yeah. Yeah, my friend Rick is actually like that. Really? Yeah, like the other day we went to eat at this Mexican place, and, like, the bill came and it was like... like I had cash and, like, he only had his card, so he was like, "Oh, I'll just pay for it on my card and you can give me cash or whatever." And I was like, "OK, cool," like, not that big of a deal, and then, you know, like, two hours later we were at home and we realized that, like, he forgot his card at the restaurant. But then it was even worse because then for, like, the next three days, anytime we went and, like, ate somewhere together or, like, did anything that cost money, he was like, "Oh, I don't have my card," and then, like, I was the only one who, like, had cash on me so I'd end up paying for everything, you know. Oh, that's not cool. That's not good. Just, like, flaking and, you know, being really, like, forgetful. Yeah, although I have to admit, I just did that about a week ago. What? Like forgot your card somewhere? Yeah. Although it's usually my keys that I forget because when I come home, I just, like, throw my stuff down, I just throw my keys, but not ever in the same place. Like it's always just, like, somewhere where I can't find them. And, like, I probably waste ten minutes a day looking for my keys. - Hey. - Hey. What's up? Uh, she's not in there, so, um, I guess I'm just going to wait inside for her, see if she calls me or shows up, you know. OK. Cool. Well, I don't know. Nice meeting you, I guess. Yeah, nice meeting you, too. No luck. No. So do you come here a lot? Um, well, I used to, but I don't so much anymore. My ex-girlfriend actually used to like to come here. Are we going to run into her? No. She actually doesn't live here. She lives in Alaska. Why Alaska? She's from there. She's from Alaska? Yeah. Interesting. What is she doing there now? She just went back home, or... Yeah. She, like, teaches history. What's her name? Amy. Do you guys still talk a lot? Uh, not really. We're not on bad terms, but we just don't happen to speak as much anymore. We shared a room. I had, you know, two roommates at the time, and she moved in with us. So it was us two in one room and then my two other roommates, which was kind of weird because the whole, like, eight months that I was living here, and she was still in Florida, I was kind of hanging out with them all the time because they're my friends or whatever. And then kind of when she got here, it was more about... I guess I sort of... we just only kind of wanted to hang out together, so it was, like, we kind of, you know, fenced ourselves off from them even though we were all living in the same place. It was, like, this thing that you want to just keep it to yourself, I guess, if that makes sense. What do you think you're going to do? That's a good question. Uh... is this place open 24 hours or... Yeah. What, are you just going to hang out here all night and wait for her? Um, yeah. You think that's a bad idea? Uh...I don't know if it's a bad idea. Maybe it's not necessarily a great idea. I mean, I don't know what-- I guess I could just keep calling her, like, try to find-- I don't have her address or anything. You can... if you want to hang out with me, I don't mind, and I mean, just while you keep trying to find her, you know. I mean, we could just hang out at my place so you don't have to just sit in the diner alone, you know. Really? Yeah, I mean, my couch is open. It's available. Well, hopefully I won't have to spend-- No, no, no, no. That's really nice. It's not weird. I just hopefully won't have to spend the night or anything because I'm hoping that she'll call me back before that happens. What are you doing now? Just making sure she hasn't called me. I'm sorry. I'm really, I'm really nervous right now. I hope I'm not freaking you out or, like... I'm just really nervous. Sorry. Can I put my stuff down, like... Yeah, yeah, wherever. OK. Do you want a drink or something? Sure. Let me see. I'm not sure what we have. Looks pretty barren. Do you want, like, a drink or do you want a drinky drink? Like alcohol? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, do you want a drink? Yeah, we can drink. Get a little loosey goosey. Um... All I have is this bottle of wine that I was actually kind of trying to save because my dad sent it to me. My dad's, like, kind of a wine nut so he'll send me these random, like, wines. I never really understand them when I get them. Like he'll talk about how great they are, and then I'll taste them, and they all taste the fuckin' same to me. But we can try it. I don't know. Do you know what pinot noir is? Is that good? I think it's supposed to be better than, like, merlot or cabernet. I like most of those that I've tried, if you want to try it. All right. We'll give it a whirl. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. So this is really nice of you to let me stay at your apartment. I know I already said this, but I really appreciate it a lot just because I don't really know what I would be doing right now if... No, that's fine. You know? Sorry, but I don't have any wine glasses. Would it be weird if... I'm not really picky. It's fine. You want to "cheers"? Yeah, we probably should. OK. To what? I have no idea. My old man? Nah. Why not? Why don't we just cheers to drinking this wine that I've been saving? OK. Sounds good. It smells weird. It's pretty bitter. And kind of sweet at the same time. Is that good? It depends on what you like. I don't really know. Do you like bitter things or do you like sweet drinks? I guess I like sweet, maybe. Do you know how to play this keyboard? Not really. It looks like you were trying to teach yourself right here. Yeah. I just hold the easy, like, chord button. How would I make a G over here? Right here. This is G. That's C Major. What's that? Is it D? No. D Minor. Yeah. So you hear the difference in this? This sounds like it's Halloween. So D... - A. - A. C. OK. Ooh, that was good. That's good! Sounds like a real song. Ooh, you got sad there. That was the Halloween, wasn't it? Yes. You're getting good at this. That song was genius. I noticed you have a little recorder over here. What's on here? Nothing. Just words. Words? Yeah. Can I play it? Um... I'm curious to see what's on it. What's that? Did I do that? I don't even remember. Sounds like a bunch of stuff going on. Yeah, it sounds like music that maybe I would have recorded, but I don't remember doing it, so... But you? Like this is you, or, like, you recorded some music? No, recorded me. Oh, really? Yeah, sometimes if l, like, don't feel like actually recording properly with a mike, I'll just do that so I can remember the notes of the song or the idea, you know. Mm-hmm. So what do you play? I can barely play guitar and barely play drums. And now you can play this. Yeah, barely. This much. Who cuts your hair? Why? Does it look stupid? No. Hey. Sorry. That's OK. It took forever. I couldn't find these matches. It's so cold. I know. I'm freezing. It's really bad. It's so cold! It's super windy. I don't even know if I'm going to be able to light this. I'll help you. Do you want to build a little fortress? Try it again. Got it. Do you always roll your own cigarettes? No, no. I just didn't have enough money to buy any nam-brained-- I mean, name-brand. You just switched the letters. I do that all the time. Me, too. How do you feel about the hair? Um...I like it. Can you tell any difference? Not really. Yeah, me either. I was scared. It was 'cause I was nervous. I didn't want you to not like it. No, it was a valiant effort. Thanks. You're welcome. I did cut hair, though. I wasn't pretending to cut your hair. I mean, I did cut some, so there is a difference. No, I can feel the little, like, hairs on my neck and stuff. Oh, can you? It's kind of making me itch. Sorry. No, it's OK. It's natural, it happens. Yeah. Man, it's cold. Are you almost done with that? What's that? Are you almost done? Yeah, actually, I only need about half to get the fix. I think I'm going to go and take a shower anyway just to get the, you know, get the little hairs off. OK. Yeah. Hello? Hello? What are you doing? It's not good. No, I can't find my friend. I can't find Samantha. No, I'm not, I'm not... I don't know what's going on. I was staying with her. I'm staying with some-- this guy. I met this guy, and I'm staying with this guy. Yeah, this guy named Charlie. I don't really know. It's not like that. What else am I supposed to do? Do you know what I'm saying? Hello? Do you want me to explain what happened? Why don't I just tell you what happened? Don't be like that. Hello? Why did you hang up? Well... I'm not doing anything wrong. I would not do that. I wouldn't do that. Fine. Hi. Hi. What are you doing? Just practicing. Yeah? How's that going? It's going good. Whose is this? Is this yours? No, it's my roommate's. I don't even know what it does. This is basically the most useless thing I've ever seen in my life. It woke you up. Yeah, that's true. I think it's fun. Sorry. How'd you like my bed? It's very comfortable. Yeah. Are you mad? I didn't mean to fall asleep. No, I didn't mean to say it like that. So...what's up? Did you find your friend? She hasn't called. Are you sick of me yet? No. Are you sure, because I understand if you are. Nope, it's OK. Are you sure? Yeah, I really have nothing else to do, so it's actually a nice, pleasant distraction. Guess what. What? I think I found her address, my friend's address. How'd you do that? The Internet. I tried to look her up. I found it. Really? You can do that? Yeah, you can do that. You didn't know that? I don't know if I like that. Well, let me see it just so l see if I know where it is. Yeah, I wrote it down. See anything? Nn-nnn. You want to ring the second floor people, and maybe they'll just let us in? How's it going? Aah! Shhh, someone might hear. Don't do that. Someone might hear. Are these hula hoops? They look kind of big to be hula hoops. I was going to say the same thing. They look really big. Oh, they're really heavy. Try to pick one up. You look so beautiful. Thanks. You kind of look like a pilgrim. I kind of look like a pilgrim. But if you put this on, it's kind of like you can hear yourself really, really well. I know. I'm hearing really weird, too. With that hat on? Uh...yeah, it sounds really different. Put this hat on. OK. It's really weird. "Feast For Crows." That's kind of a cool cover. Here. What is that, a leaf? Mm-hmm. That's weird. Maybe she's trying to flatten it for, like, a scrapbook. Is it flat? Do you think it's done? I don't know. I don't want to mess it up. I should put it back. You're next. Kind of, um... kind of cowardly so I don't really face the problem head on and just say, "This isn't working." I kind of do this really half-assed gradual... kind of just maybe try to avoid the person or ignore them until they figure it out because I'm too afraid to just do it. I just want to be-- I want what I do and what I feel to affect only me. I don't want to be responsible for other people and what they feel, you know? Does that make any sense? Well, I guess I've been dating people like you for the past couple of relationships until now, and now I'm you. But I don't really like that, but I do know for sure that I don't want to be with that person. Yeah. I don't know. Do you think it's like that we're just kind of, like, naive and impatient, and then when you get older, you sort of mature into, like, a person that can actually sustain a real relationship? Or is it that you just... you know, you're stubborn when you're young, and then as you get older, you kind of lower your standards and settle? I hope that's not true. I don't like the latter at all. What was the first one again? You just, you hope that we're going to grow up? That we'll grow up and be able to not freak out when it starts to get, you know, intense and not feel trapped, yeah. Right. And just kind of actually go with it. Well, this is my first time feeling like that. My bouncy ball doesn't work in the grass. Really? Yeah, you try it. It sort of does. Let me try one more time. That's not very fun. No, it's better on the pavement. You want to have a race? You want to race? Yeah, I want to race. Are you fast? Maybe. Are you fast? Probably. Probably? All right, where are we going to race to? That brown patch of grass and back. To your jacket? No. To this. OK. Ready? Hold on. Get behind it. OK, ready? All right, wait. Does it go, "1, 2, 3, go," or, "1, 2, 3" and 3 means go? OK. Ready? I beat you. I think I swallowed something on the way back. Like a bug? Yeah. I ran track in high school. Really? Yeah. But I'm out of shape now. Me, too. But I still beat you! I know. I'm terrible. So I'm not holding you back from doing anything today, am l? Nope. You sure? Yep. Well, do you want to go to my friend Robin's art gallery tonight? Is it going to be totally awesome? Yeah, it's going to be totally awesome. Robin's totally awesome. All right, then I'll go. It's at 6:00. It's at 6:00? Mm-hmm. You know what I could do, actually? What? While we're in the neighborhood, I could go get my hat. My friend has had this hat that I own. OK. And he's had it forever. OK. I could get it back from him. Let's get it. Is that OK? Yeah. Whatever you want to do. Yeah, let's do that. You want to go now? Yeah. I'm still out of breath. Are you? A little bit. Which one is it? Those are sort of backwards. Maybe he's not here. Hello? Hey, man, it's Charlie. I was taking a nap. Oh, sorry. Um, I don't know, can we come up? What? Did you say, "Can we come up?" Yeah. Who are you with? Um, my friend. Who's your friend? Open the door, please. What? I can't understand you. I don't know. Come on, can we please come in? Did I hear a girl's voice? Yeah. Who are you, stranger? I think he said, "Who are you, stranger?" I'm Jamie. Hey, Charlie, my friend. Hold on. Step back from the peep hole. Are you serious? I can't focus you. Hey, buddy, how's it going? How you doin', man? Good. Good to see you. It's been a long time. Hey, you guys got to take your shoes off. It's a house rule. Are you serious? Yeah. No shoes on the rug or beyond this point, basically. OK. Come on in. My name is Adam. I'm Jamie. Nice to meet you. Wow, that's a strong handshake. Boy. Uh... Charlie, today, man. Sorry. What do you got there? Got where? Never mind. They're stool coasters, chair coasters. I don't know what they're called. Jess likes them, but, you know, 'cause they keep the rug smooth, but you can see them, you know. You don't like that you can see them? Well, I don't care. I'm just saying you can see them. I like your curtains here. Did you pick all this stuff out? I did not. I picked out very little of this stuff. Who picked it out? Your girlfriend? My future wife. Wow. Since when? Since when? Um, since... June is when I proposed, is when I got down on one knee and... what do you say? Made it...made, uh... Made her an honest woman. I don't know. Guys don't wear rings, though. There's no way... To know. Yeah. How long have you been dating? Seven years. Impressive, right? It's a long time. It's almost, like, embarrassingly long to now finally be engaged. You wanted to be engaged... Well, it's like, you know, once you've reached the seven-year point and then you're like, "Oh, now we're engaged?" It's like we might as well have gotten engaged four years ago. He really just found out she had all this nice shit. Yeah, I found that out. She finally invited me into her place, and I was like, "Whoa, you've got a cool apartment. Can I live here?" Out came the ring. Yeah. Uh, Charlie? Adam. What are you doing here? Um, I just thought I'd pay you a visit. No, I actually...I wanted to get my hat that you've had for ages that I am going to need to reclaim. That figures that the first time I see you-- How does that figure? You're all locked up in paradise here. I've got your hat. Thank you. You're welcome. Are you invited to the wedding? Yeah, of course. Are you going to be the best man? Um, I don't think so. I think somebody else snatched it. I appreciate the use of that fine hat. How did it work out for you? It worked out great. That's a great hat. Hey, are you guys hungry? Do you guys like cole slaw? Yeah. You want some? I've got this great cole slaw that I'm actually really hungry for. And so I figure if I'm going to go get myself some... I feel like cole slaw is not something that our generation really appreciates as its own thing. I get it for sides at restaurants all the time. Yeah, but it's a side. It's been relegated to the sides of other meals. But I'm saying I just sometimes eat cole slaw. Like a salad of cole slaw? Not like anything. Just a big old bowl of cole slaw. It's good, right? Yep. There's more where that came from. Eat up. Where's your hat? Oh! What's that? My electric bill, but it's, like, always incorrect. I need a... something to spread the mayo. Use this. Yeah, but we just used that. Is yours delicious? It's pretty awesome. Is it? Yeah. Are you afraid to try this? To what? To try this? Sort of. That is a slathering of the mayonnaise and mustard. Eat your own sandwich! I am. OK, I'm going to cut it in half first. This is the worst game I've ever played. That's funny. Isn't that good? That's kind of enjoyable. I know. Can I take a shower? Do you mind? No. Hey, Charlie? Charlie? Oh, my God! Jamie! I can't believe you came! You look great! It's so good to see you... It's great to see you, too! ...in New York! I'm so excited to be here! I have this friend, Paul, who kind of treads the androgyny line, and I was sort of inspired by him. Um, I think I'm going to get another one... Which one? The blue and green one. It's, like, the only one that I really can, like, definitely say I'm proud of. Charlie Miller. Ha ha! What the fuck is up, buddy? How's it going? What the fuck are you doing here? Nothing, you know. Checking out some art. Yeah? Yeah. Are you writing a paper? What? Are you writing a paper? On... The art? No. I don't think I've seen you come out of Park Slope in what, like a month? Uh, I leave. I come out. Yeah? Get the paper or something like that? I'm out right now. Yeah, you are right now. Well, why don't you call me back sometime? What do you mean? Like I don't know, I called you like two weeks ago. Still haven't heard from you. No, seriously, like, what are you doing? I mean, I haven't seen you in, like, a month. I don't know. I mean, I've been kind of... well, I haven't really been that busy. Just forget it. Who the fuck is this? I'm Jamie. Hi. Hi. So what are you... how'd you end up here? You just were like, "Hey, I want to come out of Park Slope for the first time in a year, so I'm going to go to an art show"? Well, no, her friend is actually... Yeah, Robin did... Oh, Robin's your friend? Yeah, from high school. Yeah, I know Robin. That's why I'm here. Oh, great. I met Robin, like, a year ago. It was one of those, like, here's some rock bands and here's some art and here's some, you know, face painting, and get some cotton candy-- this little carnival thing. That's awesome. It was, like, over on the piers. OK. Are you from here? No, no, I'm from Atlanta actually. I was here visiting not Robin, but another friend, who I can't find, so... Isn't Robin from Atlanta? Yeah, she is. So you've known her for, like, a long time, right? Yeah, we pretty much grew up together. Was she always like that? Like too cool for school and all that? Too cool for school? Kind of. That's kind of Robin. But maybe now more so-- her hair. I haven't seen her hair like that. What do you do? Well, right now I work at, um, a restaurant. Oh, yeah? What kind of restaurant? A chain restaurant. What do you mean "a chain restaurant"? Like Long John Silver's? Not quite. Like at the drive-thru, you're like, "No fish sticks." Applebee's, actually. Applebee's! You're not gearing up to what, go back to Florida, are you? What? Last time I talked to you, you said you were like, "Oh, I'm moving back to Florida, I'm done with this," and all that, "it's too cold up here, I hate it." I didn't know that. No, he's, like, hung up on some girl back in Florida. No, I'm not. Whatever. You talk about her, like, all the time. No, I don't! No, I don't! I'm just saying, I mean, if you move back to Florida, I'm just letting you know right now that that means officially you and I are no longer friends. That's all. That's all. Well, thanks a lot for that. It's just a rule I have to make. This is my good friend, so you better be nice to her. Jamie. Yeah, I met Jamie. He's been OK. Not too bad. I had my shots today. I'm totally right. Your shots, or your shots? No, both. OK. That's good work. Thanks. Is that sincere? Do you... so do you know Robin? No, we just met. Oh, OK. Me and him, way back. Yeah, sure. Ar, ar. Really? Yeah. Like this. High school, middle school... Isn't that kind of weird that they go back and we go back? You guys know-- for real? Yeah, Charlie Miller. Tell me something about Charlie. Charlie used to-- Wait, wait, wait. OK, uh, tell me... tell me something that you know about Charlie from hanging out with him for a day, and then we'll ask, we'll ask Kyle, because I don't believe him. Should I whisper it to you? Yeah, whisper it to me. All right, all right. What have you been doing for the past day? Nothing. We've just been hanging out. OK, What is Charlie's least favorite aspect of getting his hair cut? Um, any part of it-- paying for it. So you're saying he's stingy. The back, the back-- making the back look right. No, it's wrong. It's the itchy hair. He doesn't like having itchy hair down his shirt. I never cut his hair when we were in high school or middle school because that's not something you do. Like who does that, like, "Hey, guy, let's put this Nintendo 64 down and cut each other's hair"? Who does that? Friends. We've gotten our hair cut together. OK, you're girls. I've cut her hair, actually. What guy, except for the military, gets their hair cut together? I mean, seriously. So you guys really-- I'll give you $20. Go find me a guy who got his hair cut with his friend on a regular basis, enough to know he doesn't like what, itchy hair? How does she know that? Is that even true? I don't like it. She gave me a haircut, man. I thought you met her yesterday! It was yesterday. What is wrong with you? You just meet some girl and you're like, "Hey, what's up? Cut my hair, girl." You can't even tell. That's like a $200 haircut in this city. You gave her $200 for that haircut? That will be $250. I barely did anything. I was a little nervous. Can you cut my hair? I thought you worked at Applebee's. You cut hair, too? Yeah, I do, on the side. Kyle, be nice. She brought it up. I didn't tell you to be rude to my friend. Do you guys, like, want to leave soon? Sure. I'm just kind of... OK. Yeah? Are you guys coming? Where? Ah, I think, actually, a bunch of people are coming to my house later, but it'll be a little while. Do you just want to sort of chill out and listen to music? We got a girl. Ask the girl. If you meet some strange guy and you go home-- I'm not a strange guy. He's not that strange. He's a stranger. And you go home with him, and you sleep over at his house, doesn't that mean you kind of dig him? Yeah. OK, ready? Let me see. Do you know Robin? Uh, not really. I went with a friend of hers, and I mean, I subsequently met her, but I don't know her very well. Do you live in the city? Yeah, I live in Park Slope. Nice. I live in Park Slope, too. That's a lovely place to be. Yeah, it's great. And what do you do? As of right now, not much. I actually, I just quit my job a few weeks ago, and I've just kind of been slinking around, you know. I've heard of that. I think I've done that. Actually I'm doing that, too, to be honest-- slinking around. How's it going for you? It's not paying the rent, really, but I'm hoping someday it will. I'm waiting for the glory to come. Yeah, we need to devise a plot to where we can basically do absolutely nothing and get our bills paid. I don't know. What happened? Nothing. Nothing happened? No, I mean, some stuff happened. What happened? I don't know. Just some stuff. What? You don't have to tell me. I didn't sleep with him, though. But the thing is that, like, you know, I've just sort of had, like, a hard time, um... crossing that line a little bit, and I don't really know why. Like a lot of, like, my, like, recent boyfriends, like, I've just had, like, such an intense connection to them kind of emotionally and we just talk about so much stuff that l, um... it's sort of hard for me to, like, imagine, like, being sort of, like, sexy with them when, like, it's sort of like it's all, like, cute and, like, sweet and, like, intense but like in a cerebral way, kind of. You, like, see these, like, movies and, like, these sex scenes are, like, so animalistic, and l, like, don't... I don't know. I just, like, don't-- I can't, like, I can't reconcile, like, something like that with, like, something like what I've had with these people that I've sort of had, like, a little bit longer term relationships with, you know. Mm-hmm. Um, so I guess I decided recently that, like, what I really needed was, like, someone, like, totally hot, like, unquestionably hot that was kind of a jerk maybe and so I could just get over it. So you could cross the line-- Well, maybe just get over some of it, you know, because, like--and someone maybe who I didn't have to... like, I would never do anything with anyone who, like, I didn't feel, like, a connection to, but I kind of just wanted, like, to not have to worry about... like, I didn't want this, like, long history, like, I didn't want all these memories of us, like, sort of having, like, this, you know, psychological stuff going on. I just wanted it to be, like, sort of more visceral. I think that's what I need. I've had some drinks, I will confess. What's your drink of choice? Well, the gallery had beer, so I drank that. And, um, there was a few nips of something along the way. I don't know, I haven't really been-- Like illicit nips, or liquid nips? Liquid. What would be illicit? Well, there's, you know, there's pills, there's powders, there's pipes... No, none of that. Strictly something you put in a glass. And is legal. Yeah. But, uh... like, I remember this one time, um, I was sitting in that chair over there, and he was, like, lying on his stomach, like, on the bed, and we were just listening to music and stuff, and l, like... I never would have, like, asked anyone this before, but he was lying on his stomach, like, reading a book, and I was just like, "Hey, Scott, can I ask you something?" and he's, like, "What?" And I was like, "Can I just, like, lay on top of you?" What did he say? He was, like, "Uh...OK." So l, like, came over here and, like, just laid, like, directly, like, stacked, like, right on top of him and just laid on top of him, and, like, we talked for a while. And I just remember thinking, like, you know, like one of my roommates, like, here, like, has never even had a boyfriend, and, like, I just remember, like, saying to him, "Like, this, like, feels really good. Like, I don't even know you that well. It just feels really good to, like, be, like, close to someone and stuff." And it wasn't, like, really, like, a sexual thing. It was kind of like I was fully clothed, just, like, laying on top of him, and I was just like, I just sort of felt, like, sort of sad in that moment for, like, people who, like, don't have, like, that, like, contact ever. You know what I mean? Because, like, in a sense, like, it was like, in a sense it was, like, all I needed. Like I didn't even need, like, I didn't even need, like, to get over, like, all this stuff really. Like, I think that's really just what I needed was just, like, closeness and, like, being, like, comfortable with someone, and I think that's why it was so hard to, like, say the things that I said to him that night, like, when I sort of told him that I couldn't do it anymore. I talked to this girl, and her dad, like, runs some old carpet place, and she can get, like, remnants, like, old carpet pieces and then just, like, sew the edges. It's, like, 50 bucks to sew the edges. So I got, like, a bunch of, like, little weird rugs. I feel really bad. No, you should not feel bad. I just have this class tomorrow. Oh, my God. You should have told me you had class tomorrow. Hey. How's it going? Good. I'm just... Enjoying the taps? Oh, yeah, messin' around. What have you been doing? Nothing, just walking around. Talk to anybody interesting? Talked to the same folks. Folks. But no, you can't really get into anything that important in this environment, can you? Depending. Depending if, you know, what both people want to talk about. What's that for? Your concert. My playing? I was kind of trying to be quiet. Watch. This is a good technique for high-five. If you look at my elbow and I look at yours, supposedly we'll connect better. Instead of hands. Yeah, like, don't look at my hand when you move. Look at my elbow, and I'll look at yours. OK, ready? Ready, go. Wait, hold on. OK. Do it again. You know, I mean, I don't want to, like, stop your fun. You should have told me earlier when I said about the sort of party. Maybe if we could, like, lower the music or something, and you can blame it on me. You can tell everybody that I'm a horrendous awful... No, you're not a horrendous awful. I would never say that! I would never say that. You have to find it. It's, like, way back here. This thing? Yeah. Make it as tight as possible. I'm giving the doubled up... It's like, here's the single one-- Not this one. Yeah, I know. This one. You just have to... I don't know how to describe it. You just... I'm doing it. Yeah... You said, "I'm doin' it." I'm doin' it. OK. Looks good. Thanks. When is your birthday officially? My birthday is October 28. I just have a dollar, but I can sign it if you want. OK. Can you sign it? The good thing about that is I can cash-- well, it is cash. I can't cash this. This is a totally erroneous present, as far as I'm concerned. That's why you should just smash it over your head. But it's not erroneous. I like it, though. That was nice of him to give it to me. Do you want the dollar or not? Yeah, I want the dollar. Bye. It was good meeting you. I don't know if I'll see you again. We'll do hugs. We're doing hugs. It was nice meeting you. Bye. All right, guys. Have a good night. Hey, so you're... Oh, no, I'm going to... Is it...I was going to hang here for just a couple more minutes. That's cool, right? Carroll Street. Transfer for the F train. Smith and 9th Streets next and last stop...
