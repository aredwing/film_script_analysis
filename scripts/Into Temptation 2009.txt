All those stupid people going on about whatever pops into their pea brains. And I know he's smoking out there. People talking and dancing, and um, wound up against the wall with a boy. And then we were holding hands, and then moving to the music. And, uh, and then, uh, we were kissing. Grinding. It freaked me out. It's just a dream. How old are you now, Henry? Nineteen. Still bothers you? It recurs. Can you give me one good reason why I should bring her into a church that says that she's less than a boy? It'll be here when you're gone. That's it? Well, that's a lot! Use what you can use. Is that an official Catholic position? "Use what you can use?" It's not. And you didn't hear it from me. I've been looking for work a year now. Going through the motions out there. She knows it. God help me, I almost hit Sarah. Have you ever hit her, Lloyd? No. Why'd you come here today? Hear you talk. Seem like a man has an idea what's going on. Thank you. And Sarah made me. His new smoke eater... Is there some specific transgression you would like to talk about, Anita? Where do I start, Father? He's gonna have a stroke if he doesn't listen to his doctor or his wife, who still cleans an office nights to make ends meet, and has a hot meal on the table every damn day, Father. I ask Miguel, a man of some age, to do only two things. Pick up his dirty socks and his wet towels. Father, I have a long bus ride home from a long day's work. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, by the grace of God. Bless me, Father. I have sinned. My last confession was 19 years ago. Welcome back. I'd like to confess a sin I haven't committed, yet. Can I do that? Well that's, that's never come up. Uh... What's the sin? I'm going to kill myself. On my birthday. And I'm Aries, Father, so I don't have a lot of time. You there? Yes. What I say here stays here, right? Between you and God. There a time limit? Um, no. I have to, I have to say mass in a half hour. But if-if you're not done by then... Oh, I'll be done. I was 12 the first time my stepfather raped me. I was... 13 when I learned to like it. Now you have an appointment, Father. And I'm done. Do I know you? That was, uh, I mean your, your confession actually it's called, uh, reconciliation these days. Same thing. Just tell me whether I'm damned to hell or not, Father. I'll leave you alone. At this... At this point, normally I'd, I would... We're out of time, Father. I would, um, I would like to, I would like to continue talking if that's all right. Are you there? Hello? Hello? I started to write a suicide note and decided it might not get read. That's how alone I am. And I'm Aries, Father, so I don't have a lot of time. Hello? Hello, Helen. Uh-huh. I'm so sorry. Yes. I'll be down first thing in the morning. I can come right now if you'd like. No? Okay. All right, tomorrow. Bye. I'd like to confess a sin I haven't committed, yet. Glory be to the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now and shall ever be, world without end. Amen. Let the love of your family, Ray, standing here with me, and your extended family, and your sea of friends, and all those you have touched in your life speed you on your journey home. Amen. A- N-D-R-O-P-O-L-O-U-S. Greek father, Irish-Apache mother. Fiery little pipe-cleaner of a woman. God bless her soul. How did you find us, George? I saw your sign. There's no, uh, drinking while you're here. Had damn near a year of sobriety once. I know I can do it. When was that? Seventeen years ago. Well, you can stay up to three months. We have an employment counselor that comes in once a week and a social worker is on staff. This is for you. What's in it? Toothbrush, toothpaste, clean socks and underwear. I haven't been treated this well since I left the Merchant Marine. Breakfast is at eight, dinner is at five. Sign up for the laundry and the shower. You're free to come and go. Just don't drink, George. Check. Drink and we have to say goodbye. I won't let you down, Father. This is the gospel of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Good evening, St. Mary Magdalen's. Happy St. Cyril Day. Today is his feast day. Not a very famous Saint. He always lived in the shadow of St. Patrick, I think. Cyril was a member of a group called The Solitaries, who, um, well, they lived lives of complete chastity, poverty, sobriety. It's no wonder the Irish didn't adopt him. l- I like to, uh, I like to study the saints that are less famous. The ones that didn't get their own day. Have you ever heard of St. Hubert the Silent? Yeah, he was, well, he was so silent none of us know about him. Or, St. Richard the Whoremonger? Not making this up. The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines a saint as a person who has lived an exemplary life. I'd like to confess a sin I haven't committed, yet. Can I do that? Let's think for a moment about where we are right now. How Mary Magdalen purportedly lived before encountering Christ. The profession known as the oldest. What does an exemplary life really mean? How did a whoremonger make it in? That's how alone I am. Hey. It's John. I'm fine. Don't be late to your opera. Go. I'm... everything's... Can't a son call his mother? I'm fine. I'll call again. I promise. Yes, I'd like to see you, too. What're you seeing? Hm. She dies at the end. What do you think? About what? My name is John. I know. You do? You're kidding, right? Nope. We've been waiting on you. You have? Quite a show. It's my first time down here. That's good. "First time." That's a hoot. I love that. You might have me mixed up with someone else. Yeah, maybe I do. You let me know when I'm needed. Okay, Zeke. Thanks. What you need, baby? Maybe Miriam can help. I'm looking for someone. Yeah, who? My sister. She down here, maybe you don't wanna find her. 'Scuse me, baby. Hey! Just curious. What's behind the "Members Only" curtain? Can't tell you. Why not? You're not a member. How do I become a member? Invite only. And who does the inviting? I do. How do I know if I want to become a member if I don't know what goes on, you know, in the club? Come around again. I'll think about it. Maybe I will. Spending a little money in here doesn't hurt. Oh, okay. $ 12. Um, wait. Close enough. You okay? Hey! Oh, sorry. How you doing? What? How are you? I'm good. Can you spare a buck? You know what? I just spent all my money on a... Oh. Why do you have those? I, I use them to pray. For who? Anyone who needs it. They work? I don't know. They're pretty. Excuse me. Here, take them. No! Go on. You sure? Sure. Yeah. Thanks! Don't mention it. Luke tells us today that Jesus had the unmitigated gall to dine with a tax collector. That's right. Just as popular then as they are today. Somewhere just south of hooker on the sinner chain. And this is the kind of behavior that drove his disciples crazy! "It makes you look like a nut job, Jesus." And they were right. I mean, who befriends his auditor, takes him to dinner, and then picks up the check and doesn't try to write it off? Jesus seemed to have an affinity for the hard-to-love. I think he had low self-esteem. I mean, we know he had a father-complex, right? And how-how could he not have issues with his virgin mother? But still, he showed us how to love. Which is more than I can say for me, standing here before you, simply preaching. Amen. Body of Christ. Amen. Body of Christ. Amen. Body of... John. I need to talk to you. I will be right back. The place looks nice. They take care of me in the manner to which I am accustomed, John. Unlike that heathen parish of yours. Hey, I like where I work. Yeah. Well you always were a glutton for punishment. Your sermon was funny. I would've actually prepared something if I knew you were coming. You were the best in seminary. You haven't lost it. Pure bullshit artistry, John. My dad always said that the Blarney Stone kissed me. Don't say a word. Let's walk. High cholesterol. I have to lose I've been put on a diet of rabbit food and forced to exercise. Smokes? I'm down to a pack a week. Why don't you just quit? They're my little friends, John. Do not take them away from a lone, celibate, poor priest. You had me going till the poor part. I, uh, I seek counsel, Ralph. That's what I do. It is a matter of reconciliation and you can't be specific. Right. You wanna help someone. Yeah. Who told you something in the confessional. You're gonna keep me guessing or you gonna tell me what the hell's going on? You're not taking matters into your own hands. Not really. I have no idea how to find her, anyway. Her? It happened to be a her, yeah. A her you know? I don't think so. You know, there was something familiar about her, though. In serious trouble, I think. Life and death. I know I'm obsessing, but... You know, what am I if I don't try to help? A professional. With boundaries! Oh, yeah, that. Come on. People lie in the confessional, John. They wanna make it sound good. I had a woman who confessed to me all of her confessional lies. Said she'd been making it up for years. Sort of a Catholic Munchhausen Syndrome. Nah. This woman was telling the truth. Sometimes you just know a thing. I do not wanna hear that you were assigned to a parish in Kabul for violating one of the only rules that does not need changing. Well, God forbid, we bend a rule to save a life, Ralph. I mean it John. Do not cross that line. That's my counsel. And when you do, just please be discreet. Just tell me whether I'm damned to hell or not, Father. I'll leave you alone. My mother, she didn't want me to become a priest. She tells me that every time she sees me. That bother you? A little. Mm-hm. What about your dad? What-what about him? He want you to become a priest? No. No. I mean I, I never knew him. You didn't? No. He, he left my mom and me when I was three, four. How come? I don't know. He went out one night, never came back. You angry about that? No. Angry? Why would I be? I don't know. I never knew the guy, so. Wasn't a factor in my life. Persona non grata. Okay. No one's ever asked me that before. Worried about her immortal soul. I'll be god damned if I pass that on to my daughter. I'm sorry about the language. Maybe I am just a fag. Have you considered that? What? That you might be gay? I am. It's okay. I've said that to no one. Well, then it was high time. It's okay. You okay? I'm sorry. Hey, don't be. Just hearing you say that so matter-of-fact. Well, it-it's nothing to be ashamed of. You really believe that? I do. What do I tell Glennis? My parents? Nothing. Nothing? Get used to it. Walk around with it awhile. Pray on it. I can pray on being a fag? It's who you are, right? Accept it about yourself. Your loved ones will fall in line. Yeah, or they won't. Or they won't. Can you come back? Yeah, sure. We should keep talking. About your dad? No, no. About, uh, about anger. It stays bottled up, starts to feed on itself. That's true. Know what a heavy bag is? You kidding? No. Golden Gloves. Fourteen years. Won City back in '89. Retired on top. Huh! Excuse me. Hi, sorry. I'm looking for information, information on prostitutes. Three general kinds of hookers, Father. There's your street whores. Mostly addicted, almost all former offenders. Short professional life span and short life span. Period. This book was written by one who got out. Actually readable. Out-call hookers. Slightly different animal. Many drug users who maybe haven't slid as far down the scale. Generally nicer looking. Most out-calls are repped by a pimp, who runs escort/massage ads, gets a girl out of jail, pays some bills, et cetera. How does a librarian know so much about prostitutes? Why does a priest want to know? Please, continue. Needs a place like Vegas or L.A. to work. This one can afford to eat well, stay in shape, get those boobs done. You can't afford this girl, Father. If you were looking for a specific girl but you didn't know anything about her... You know nothing? Well, um, I know a little. But most of it's protected by... Sacramental Seal? Hm? Right. That doesn't help. No. She wears a crucifix. So do I. She's an Aries. Great. What's her major? Her voice is unique. Um... I don't know. I'd recognize it in a heartbeat. Now it's my pleasure to turn things over to Father John, who will lead our discussion as he does at the beginning of every month. Father? I'm sorry, Rosemary. I forgot what today's topic is. Oh. Faith Based Public Policy: Blessing or Curse. Right. Right. It's a curse. Hi. Hey! We-we talked the other night. I was looking for my sister. Oh, yeah. Find her? I'm not really looking for her. No? I don't even have a sister. I got five. One baby brother. Boy was 12 first time he saw the inside of a bathroom. I told you a lie. What you need? Maybe Miriam can help. I was, uh, I was hoping we could just, um, talk for a minute. What? You some kinda Eye-Team reporter gonna put me on TV? No, no. They did that once, baby. There I was, shaking my ass on the evening news. My, um, whatchacallit, I'm a, uh, Catholic priest. Don't hear that everyday. C'mon, Father, buy me a drink. In a nice place. She your girl or somethin'? She's in trouble. Needs help. St. Clair might know her. Who? James St. Clair. Big alpha pimp this year. Most of the girls with him. Do you think he'd talk to me? Might. Might kill you, too. He's moody. Holds court in Sundays on Harney. Go in there and you ain't a brother, you best have backup. Right. I'll drink one more of these, Father. Hi. Sorry. Can I have another one? Do you remember? Vodka martini? Yeah. Thanks. Twelve bucks. Okay. This is for you. Thank you. You want a drink? No. I'm an outlaw. What's that? No pimp. I'm too hard to beat up and I ain't gonna lay down for these motherfuckers. When they realized they couldn't kill me, shit, they left me alone. That's good. And none of em' know shit about money. I gotta plan for my future. This line ain't got no 401 K, Father. I never thought of that. Let's go. I've gotta go. You do? I've gotta go. Yes, sorry. You've been very helpful, though. Thank you, Miriam. Motherfucker really did just wanna talk. Whoa. Gimme your money! Hey! Okay, man! I'll cut your fucking dick off! All right, all right. Here, just relax, okay? Hey. What's the other guy look like? Um, he was ugly. I have something for you. What? It's a license plate number. That I can work with. How we doing? We're late. All right, let's do this thing. I was mugged. A man hit me the other night. He threatened me with a knife, he took my money, and gave me this shiner. He scared me so bad I wet my pants. I mention it because I know others have gone through it. Assault. Battery. Domestic abuse. When you're the victim, you don't wanna talk about it. Why me? I must be a bad person for that to happen. And then it makes you angry. What kind of a man can't defend himself walking down the street? I don't like these feelings. I tried to hide them yesterday because I'm still ashamed. And I'm broke. I could use the money. And the confidence, I lost. And the dignity. Me talking, you listening. Thanks. Now, let us say a prayer for the bastard who mugged me because he needs it. Let us pray. John Buerlein. Buy an old girlfriend a drink? Were you gonna call, you big jerk? I was, um, conflicted. Oh. Well, some things never change. I'm divorcing Daniel. What happened? He had an affair. Why'd he do that? He's nuts. He's one of those men that hates women but is biologically compelled to wanna fuck us. Sorry. Sorry. What about Christopher? We're moving back here. So I might see you around? My mother told me that you opened a shelter and single-handedly saved this parish from extinction. Oh, don't be humble with me. It's true. She's right. Yeah? You look good, Nadine. Yes. I would like to speak to the Archbishop if I could. Anita Mendoza. It's personal, and a very difficult call to make. It concerns the pastor in our parish. Yes, I'll hold. Hi. Hi. It's me again. Hi. You know James St. Clair? Who? A big alpha pimp. A lot of girls are with him. Never heard of him Who did you say you were? Uh, John Buerlein. I'm a Catholic priest. Oh. Sure. Nice to know you. Likewise. On the house. Yeah? Any friend of St. Clair's is a friend of mine. Thought you didn't know him. Hi. Excuse me. Can you, can you hear me? No... Oh, okay. Um, hi. I just, I wanted to, uh, I'm trying to find someone, and I was wondering if you could... No, you don't have to dance. I'm trying to, uh, find someone. Can you, can you hear me? You can't hear me, can you? He'll pass out soon. I'm Sharon. Linda. Thanks for letting us in. You know, he's an Aries, ruled by Mars, so he always gets a little bit nuts leading up to the full moon. I'm Aries. Where are my girls? You here alone? Uh, yep. No family, or...? Nope. I have a stepfather somewhere, but I haven't seen him for years. I always wondered about you down here. Sharon, where are you? You know it's... All I ever wanted just to be a part of a nice little family, you know. Yeah. Uh, could you hold her a sec? Oh, l... I gotta pee. I'll be right back. Hi. Okay, ladies, don't rush. This is not a race. We have, okay. We have a whole piece of music to fill up. Let the audience drink you in! You look like Rocky. Oh, yeah? Marciano or Balboa? I got a phone call about you. You did? Archbishop Fulton Aloysius Meehan. Yep. Very cordial. Knows we're friends. He called you about me? Heard you were in an altercation. What? Late to mass a couple a times. Swear words from the pulpit. How the hell did he... Other modes of behavior not befitting one of his pastors. Visits to the red light district. Yes. One of your faithful saw you coming out of Tits R Us, and reported in. Why didn't he call me? And handle something directly? Please. He has a reputation to uphold. Okay! Men, yes, it's time for you to be at the altar. Do not keep the ladies waiting. Work with me, boys! I told him that you were working with gangs, and that you had signed the leader up for seminary. You did not. He thinks you're working on the streets with actual people. An assignment that terrifies him. You're being watched. I am? I am worried. For me. John, I do not want to lose a Monday night dinner and movie companion. That would upset me very much. Okay. Take five, and then we'll meet for notes. Is this a wedding or a production number? What are you doing, John? It's almost over. I think. How can I help? Well, I could use some money, actually. How much? $500? I'm shocked that you think that I have that kind of money just lying around. I have three. It's your mother. Nadine Brennan is in town. Bumped into her and her mother shopping. She looks wonderful, John. You should call her. I mean it. Give her a little thrill. Not meddling, just have time on my hands. What with no grandchildren. I've got info. Car belongs to Steven Miller. 17 West Happy Hollow Boulevard. Mr. Miller is a partner at the STORM, BERG CPA's. More as it comes in. Well, good morning. How can I help you today? I'd like set up an appointment. With, uh, Steven Miller. Uh, let me just check Mr. Miller's schedule here. When did you wanna come in? As soon as possible. Okay. I think I can get you in next week. No. Um, no. I-I need it much sooner than that. Have you seen Mr. Miller before? No. Are you with a firm, sir? I'm the pastor of St. Mary Magdalen's Catholic Church. It's a matter of some urgency. I can probably get you a half hour? Okay. We do offer a clergy discount. I'll take it. Sorry I'm late. The love for my grandchildren who do not exist rots on the vine. Hello, son. You should have had more kids. What in God's name happened to you? I was mugged. Mother, I need to be blunt. Please, tell me everything. I can't stay. And I need to borrow $200. Dear God! Oh. Thanks. You got your hair done. It looks good. Heard you were mugged. Yeah, yeah. Thanks for coming in. I have time on my hands. I need some help, Lloyd. It's a job. It's kinda difficult to ask. It's potentially dangerous. I'll pay you for it. I'll do it. You wanna know what it is? Doesn't matter. You'll have to keep it under your hat. When do we start? Tonight. It's night work. I'll take a nap. Yes. I'd like to cancel my paper. Effective now. Mm-hm. Permanent. Oh, you can give the refund to my carrier. Do you know who she is? Thank you. Hi. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Judy tells me you're with a church? Yes. Well, I'm not here on behalf of my church. No? I don't have a lot of time, Mr. Miller, and I don't wanna waste yours. Plus, I can't afford to be here long. What can we do for you? You were with a woman, not your wife, in a bar in Lowertown. Cafe Havana. She met you there at approximately 9:00 P. M. You left together. This can be verified. Who are you? I'm John Buerlein. St. Mary Magdalen's Church. You've got a nerve walking in here. I need to find her, and I have very little time. I'd like to cancel my cable. Permanent. Mm-hm. Yep. No. Sure, yeah, I'll hold. What do you want? Um, well, I-I wanna know her name. Her name is Linda. Last name? I don't know. Um, where does she live? I don't know. Near the bar. Okay. How do you know that? That's why we meet there. Can you describe her voice to me? Yeah, she... I don't know, she has a unique voice. It's, uh... sexy. How long have you known her? Why am I talking to you? Because I am asking nicely. What are you gonna do with this information? I'm gonna go tell Judy the receptionist if you don't cooperate. Please. How long have you known her? I have been seeing Linda for a massage. I don't know, three years. Do you see other masseuses? No. How did-how did you find her? Referral. Not an ad in a magazine? No. No, she's not that kind of... Hooker? I'm not sure a man in your line will understand this, Father, but do you really wanna know about Linda? Yes. It's different with her. I'm more like a client than a john. She only has a few of us. We pay her extremely well and she makes it worth our while. How-how does she do that? She... she's totally into it. She makes you happy to be a man. I think she improves my marriage to a woman who lost interest in me after our third child was born. Would your wife agree with that? No, she would not. I know the risk I run being with Linda. I've decided she's worth it. Or was. What? She... what, what do you mean? Linda ended it after our last meeting. She left me a note. What did it say? It said that she was leaving. Permanent. Didn't say where. That's it? It said a few other things that are none of your business. I don't care what you're after. How did you contact her? We had a standing appointment. Three years she never stood me up once. Like to have an office full of employees like her. I'm sure you would. I'd like you to write down what she looks like. What? Height, weight, everything. I wanna know what she looks like. You don't know what she looks like? Just her mouth and her neck. Please, hurry. I have to get back to work. Donald Dupree, please. Room 207. Follow me, please. He doesn't have much time. We didn't know about any relatives. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy... Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been three to five years since my last confession. That's a long time. I've been pretty good. Okay, and what did you wanna discuss today? Impure thoughts. Go on. I have designs on a man I'm not supposed to have designs on. Designs? I want relations with him, Father. Mental, physical, emotional. And I can't have it, and it pisses me off. Pardon my goddamn language. Are you here to talk about your designs or your anger? I wanna talk about why you left me. You left me, Nadine. Excuse me? I went to college. Give a girl a chance to figure it out, for God's sake. You were right. We were too serious too young. No. I came back. Four years later. I was in seminary. Oh. Right. Your calling. I always hoped that would be the wrong number. Nadine? Yes, Father? Why are you drunk? I'm not drunk! I had three little goblets of screwdriver. Christopher is gone for a week. To the dickhead dad's. And I've never been without him. And I'm really scared to be alone. You know what you need? Food. C'mon. Hey, Donald. Who is it? It's your stepdaughter, Linda. Goddamn. Didn't know if you were alive. I'm alive. Me, too. Barely. Today your birthday? Yeah. Do you remember the first time you raped me? Came into my room when mama wasn't home and had your way with me? I was 12. What do you want? I never raped nobody. No? That was... consensual. We both know it, and there's no use acting like it didn't happen, especially after all these years. What do you want? Want you to listen. Okay? Okay. That's a terrible thing you did. I hope you still aren't pulling that shit. Can't imagine you are being as old as you must be, but I've heard worse. Mainly though, Donald, l... I just want to say, after all the years of hating I've done, I just, I just... I wanna say I forgive you, Donald Dupree. You're forgiven. This, this is for you. You take care now. So this is Hill House, huh? The food is really good. I know. I have the women of Sodality to thank for that. Aren't you eating? No, I have to say mass in five minutes. Do you still love me, John? If you're worth your weight in salt as a priest, you'll tell me the truth. Yes. Do you desire me? Nadine... These guys don't care. Have you... Have you had me in your mind? I had you in high school. You were my only. Oh, God, you don't know how happy that makes me. I'm not comfortable talking about this right now. Okay, fine. Okay? Can we be friends? Of course. No, no, no, no. I mean it. Can you handle it? Relating to someone you love? Someone that you desire? Someone that you don't have to save? I think so. Can you? Of course. I'm a woman. I have to go. Rosemary is driving you home. Okay? Bye, Johnny. So, how is it here? Good. Can't drink. Well, that sucks. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for Thy is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. Danny, could you get the lights for me? Yeah. Yeah sure. Hey. You're early. Ready when you are. Okay. Well, I'm trying to locate someone. A woman who I think may be in trouble. And I need to see a man who might know where she is. And, um, well, I need you to... Watch your back? Yeah. I'm hoping it's the easiest money you'll ever make. I'd do it for free. You kidding? I'm not paying you enough. Hey! You wanna dance? I'm here to talk to someone. Talking's overrated. C'mon. Haven't seen you before. Haven't been here. Isn't this better than talking? There's someone I need to see. Yeah? Who? James St. Clair. You know him? You a cop? No, I'm a priest. Oh, shit. He's back there. You need to loosen that shit up a little. Marta! There you go. Excuse me. Hi. Um... I'll be god dammed. I beg your pardon? The motherfuckin' Iron Curtain himself, standing before me. How you doing, Jamal? I wanna talk to you! I never liked you anyway. This motherfucker could take a punch and would not go down. Took a few too many, maybe. Didn't even know who we were lookin' for. No one ever saw anything like the Iron Curtain, standing there all bloody with his hand in the air. Golden Glove champion of the motherfuckin' city. I was there that night, man, with brother Maurice. I knew him as Jamal Sinclair. Welter weight. Hit you like a hammer. Re-invented myself a little. You the one everybody watchin', man. Now, who's this white man? He's my friend. Then he's mine, too. I'm trying to locate a woman. Blond, pretty. Been at it a while. Been at what? Life. Prostitution. What makes you think I know her? I was told you know things about who's working, et cetera. Who's talkin' to you about me? Uh, some people I don't even know who are very frightened of you. Got reason to be. Loose-lipped motherfuckers. Um, she has some steady clients, I think. That's nice. Clients. That's civilized. She must be good. Oh, I wouldn't know anything about that. You might be lookin' for Linda. Yeah, that's her name. That's who I'm looking for. Why you want her? I have reason to believe she's in trouble. What kinda trouble? Who are you, man? I'm a... I'll give you my card. I'm a Catholic priest. You call the Police? No. No, no, no, no. I haven't seen her in awhile. She, uh, discreet. Used to live down here. Farnam Street, maybe. We seemed to have fallen off her mailing list. Oh. Okay, Thank you. Thanks. Tell you one thing about Linda. She one of the best. Love you like a hurricane. You know that, do you? I do. Now, I'm gonna have to ask you, gentlemen, to get outta my office. "I got promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep." Father! You a wise man bringin' the Curtain with you. He just quoted Robert Frost. He's always been a little strange. Start checking mail-boxes. How do we get in? Ring some bells. Maybe we'll get lucky. C'mon, there's someone I want you to meet. Hi, Zeke. This is my friend, Lloyd. I know who he is. We're trying to find somebody. Not having much luck. You're looking for that girl, aren't you? You're on the wrong damn street. How do you know who we're looking for? You're kidding me, right? No. Can you describe her? Blond. Blue eyes, pale skin, full lips, nice nose. Petite. A looker. Ten West 38th Street. St. Mary Magdalen's Church, please. A unique voice. Sultry. Left me a nice tip. More than a tip. She gave me a gift. Keep it. Watched her walking up the steps. I thought I was looking at an angel. You-you drove her to the church? I drove her to see you. And I couldn't stop thinking about her. How she kept from floating away. What do you mean? I never met someone so empty. She got out of my cab. It's like I imagined her. So I went back. To be sure. Occasionally you need to know whether you've gone all the way around the bend or not. This is the Gospel of the Lord. Thanks be to God. Good Evening, St. Mary Magdalen's. Happy St. Patrick's Day. I didn't see her, so I listened to you talk. And I looked around a little, and I understood why she had gone there. Then I saw you on the street, and I knew everything was as it should be. Here it is. Where are we? Fremont Street. Nah, she paid already. Can you wait? I ain't going anywhere. Think that's it? What now? Ring that one. What is it? Open up. We don't wanna use force. This the Police? Fire! Okay, I'm a priest, and this is my assistant. And if, if-if you have keys, we need in. I'm opening this door for the Police, sweetie. That's it. Who the hell are you guys? We're just trying to help someone. Something wrong with Linda? We're not gonna be here long, okay? We won't harm anyone, but we need in. Now. Anybody asks, I'll swear on a stack of bibles you guys forced me. I don't care if you're the Pope. What does it say? "Here is two months rent. Keep my damage deposit. I forgive you for being such an asshole and not fixing my faucet." I'll take that money. What is it? It's an article about my ordination twelve years ago. I'll be damned. Oh, I'll take that money, Father. What am I supposed to do with her shit? That's more than we talked about. You've earned it. Zeke, I'm paying you for your time, like it or not. Go ahead. I need help at the church, Lloyd. Yes, you do. I've been thinking about it. I want you to come to work for me. What kinda work? Hill House. I need somebody reliable to check people in and out, maintenance, security, bookkeeping. Something better comes up, you can leave whenever you want. He'll do it. When do I start? Monday morning, 8:00 A. M. I'll be there at 7:00. I'll be there at 8:00. Hey. Hey! How you doing? What? How are you? Fine! How are you? Fine! Can you spare a buck? What? Help me out with a buck? You need a buck? If you can spare it. I don't... I don't have any money. Oh. I gave it all away. You did? I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. You need any makeup? I'm good. Here. What? Take them. You want me to have those? Yeah. Why? Why not? Who are you? Gus. Today's my birthday. Happy Birthday! I baptize you, Teresa Marie, and wash you free of sin. In the name of the Father, and the Mother, and the Son, and the Daughter, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Welcome to the world, you. I think the Orchid Committee went a little overboard this year. You have an Orchid Committee? I seek forgiveness, Ralph. I'd like you to hear my confession. Can I just absolve you upfront and avoid all the embarrassing details? I need to talk it out. Let's do it outside. I seek a smoke. Someone came to me for absolution and she didn't receive it. Why not? Because I got caught up in the sensational details of the confession itself. Must've been some confession. It was the most heart-rending examination of a life I've ever heard. And now it's too late. Why too late? 'Cause she's probably dead. We're working with immortal souls, John. They don't die. Absolve her now. I can do that? You have to. That's your penance. Absolve your penitent in absentia, and then I'll absolve you. Plus, say three Our Fathers, three Hail Marys, and a Glory Be. Okay. And commit a random act of kindness of your choosing. Done. Yes? You have a leaky faucet? Kitchen sink. It's driving me crazy. I'm here to fix it. All right. Thanks. It's no problem. You know, I hadn't even called about that. Have a nice day. Are you cold? Haven't been here long. I wanted to thank you. For what? For taking pity on a pathetic drunk. No, really. You wanna come in? No. I wouldn't wanna put you in a compromising position. It's way too late for that. Actually, I'm picking up Christopher in the morning from the airport. So, gotta grocery shop. I, um, Here. What's this? I owe you a dinner. Really? It's just a certificate. There's probably enough for two. Thanks. I'll see you around. You made a good and sincere confession, Linda Salerno. And through the ministry of the Church, and by the grace of God, and from the bottom of my heart, I absolve you of all sin. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Go in peace. You've done your penance. I bet she wears hand-me-down underwear. Leave her alone. John Buerlein! Get back in line!
