I see you had trouble with your photo shoot.. Yeah. Lower your chin and try for slight overexposure. What? The secret to taking a good picture of yourself. l see. You're quite tall. l am? About 6-foot-one? Something like that. Blood type B, but people think you're an A. l'm an ''O.'' I'm an A that looks like a B. ls that so? And you're from? Mr. Ozawa! I'll di whatever it takes We agreed... this is what's best for you! No, it's not! Just stop it! We'll keep Mr. Ozawa here tonight just to be safe. What's wrong with him? His symptoms are stable. You needn't worry. We'll do some tests tomorrow. I understand. Thank you. Maybe you should've said a word of thanks. Catch a cold, Rio? You okay? lt's nothing. Well, shall we get to work? Okay. - You're cute. Thanks. Excuse me. Hello? What? Something wrong? Something urgent's come up. Getting the jitters, huh? Don't worry. I'll be gentle. I'm sorry. I've gotta go. Hey! Hello? Hello? Rio's late. That's rare. Yeah, she's usually the quickest worker among us. Maybe her cold is slowing her down. Speak of the devil. She's gone home. Still in top form. ?? Mr. Ozawa? Where are you now? Hospital lobby. Hello? Hello? Why're you...? l don't know. Why'd you come here? I don't know. I was worried. Worried about what? You don't even know me. You're 6'1", blood type O, a little anti-social... sad and distant... someone who's lost hope. Am l wrong? Six feet even. What? My height. l was close. Anti-social is right. Did I just see a smile? So it's possible. No, l didn't. - You did. - l've never smiled. Liar. I'm not good with people. So l think... Don't worry. That's my area of expertise. The Hojo Regents unified land tenure and taxation code... to establish a stable stream of revenue. It extended bureaucratic reach into... Teach me Japanese history. What? Why me? What do you mean "why"? I saved your life, right? Then what? Then I got the professor to promise me private lessons. Come next Monday, then. l will! I hoped to have dinner with him, and find out more.. his likes and dislikes. No way! You have a rival! A real viper, too, l bet. l think so. How do you know? By the timing of her entrance. lt's standard. Straight out of a comic book. Have a visitor? Yes, an acquaintance. l was just leaving. Wait a second. - Kaori's just... ''Kaori,'' huh? lt's not my business. Why did I behave like that with the professor? You've fallen in love, what else? - Love? Love. Like this. Give me a break. If not love, then what? No way. You're cute when you're jealous, Rio. What's that mean? Come in. Excuse me. Oh, it's you. You really are in high school. It surprises everybody. l'm ready to learn, Sir. This was the Battle of Okehazama.. And what a fight it was. Arguably the greatest upset in military history. Aided by rain, Nobunaga led an assault You really love history, don't you? Sorry. Iget carried away. and really enthralling. Oh, l don't know. Let's end here. We'll pick up from Okehazama next time. Okay. I'm sorry about the other day. What? I was very rude. I don't know what got into me. I shouldn't have taken that attitude with you. What's more... Oh... no, that's okay. Kaori is... that woman is my cousin. Your cousin? Really? Why do you follow me? Because you're there. Strange answer. You ever see a stalker this cute before? Here goes. Why me? What's wrong? Your food's getting cold. This ramen's amazing! Really? Seems pretty runofthemill to me. Trust me. Tell me, professor... do you have a wife or girlfriend? Nope. Seems a waste. Not interested. Too much trouble. You gay? No. I'm kidding. Don't get angry. l'm not angry. I'm just not good with people. I see. Must be hard for you. Sometimes. Don't you get lonely? l've never felt that, no. What? No alcohol. l'll be your girlfriend. You can't. Why not? Am I that unattractive? No, you're young, charming and pretty. Then why? Well, you're a minor, for one. So what? lt's a big deal. What? No, l didn't! G' night. Thanks for dinner! Welcome. Hamburger joint next time? Now hold on. No? Like l said... If I score 100 on my school history exam, take me on a date. It'll make me study real hard! What kind of teacher are you? You want to crush a student's drive to excel? All right. Yes! Woohoo! Fine, now goodnight. Goodnight. Professor? Just tell me when. When what? When my age no longer matters. Until then, I'll forgive any other woman you have. Professor! Stop it. Stop. Shall we get going? Why not? Let's roll. Rio? You okay? Forgive me. I know I started this, and I'm being selfish.. but I can't keep doing this after I met him. Rio? Talk to us. What about Yuji? I plan to tell him. And "Papa," too. We won't be able to use the condo anymore. You serious? You're really in love? Yeah. You dating? No. Actually, he's not that interested in me. You're kidding? He must be something. He's an ordinary guy. Really? I thought it was kind of cool the way you removed yourself... you know, from love and all that.. Disappointed? No, I'm actually,... relieved. You're a regular girl, after all. Yuji... Can l ask a favor? Sure. Sleep with me one last time. Please! I didn't see this coming! As a final memory, please! One last time! l missed you, Rio. What's so urgent? l've fallen for someone. l mean completely. Are you... cutting me off? ??? Just not romantically. I thought we were special! You want me to be like Tomoko and the rest? l'm sorry. Rio, how'd it go? No. One measly point. I'm telling the teacher off crushing love! Yeah, let's! He's too picky! Marking off for this and that! lt's okay. Thank you guys, though. But l did my best. I have to tell the professor How'd it go? Let me see. "Who commanded the riflemen at the battle of Nagashino?" Sassa, Maeda, Nonomura, Akechi, Ban.. oh, I see. He docked you for Akechi, huh? He was looking for the name, Fukutomi. But newer theories place Akechi among them as well. So if I were grading this... it's correct. Here. Really? Truly? Does this mean a date? Well, a promise is a promise. Yes! l did it! Yes! Wait... you wanted to go on a date with me, didn't you? No! That's how I would grade it! As a neutral scholar! Fine, whatever. Sorry. Wait long? Where shall we go? Anywhere you want. No, it's your celebration. We can't....???? I want to go where you want. What's this? Senbon was behaded here. In 1560, by Munenori Nasu at the Battle of the Matsugahara. An inscription! Professor, come here! What is it? This helmet has the word "ai" on it. That means ''love''! l think it suits you. Hey! Come on, Rio. Did you just call me "Rio"? Keep going, Rio Ozawa. Wait up! This is what I wanted to show you.. It's the Toyotomi family crest. Nice souvenir, Tomoko! Thanks, Rio. lt's cute. And for Maki... Me, too? Kenshin Uesugi! Ugh. This is Miho's. Whose crest is this? Mitsunari lshida. These were hard decisions. You really didn't have to get us souvenirs. Of course l did! Thanks to you, I got to date the professor. Oh, l've got photos! That's more like it. Ta-dah. This is the ravine where Masamune laid in waiting. Wow.. who's Masamune? Rio, what's this? A head tomb. Very romantic. Coming! ls Naoko in? No, she stepped out. I see. I'll check back later. Rio! You're here! ? You haven't been to school. What is this!? It's so cool! Wow! Are you sure? Of course. Who was that man with you? He's my mom's squeeze. A loser. He makes her work while he gets drunk. Real dirtbag. You look thin. Have you been eating? Rio? What is it? Nothing. Really? Happy? With what? You know what. Wrong book. So! Do you like me!? Tell me! ''ldiot.'' Ow. What? Very sharp. You look great. Whatever, let's go. No, really. Thanks. Hey.. can I assault you? No, you can't. Rats. What's ''1 4'' mean? ??? Hey... you asleep? It was seen as a shift to a new order befitting of modern times. attack on Odarawa Castle but... .. anyone in defiance was... um... namely, Hojo Ujimasa was ordered to,... ...commit harakiri. Excuse me. Names get harder to recall at my age. FujiwaranoKamayatsu FujiwaranoKamayatsu You mean ''Kamatari.'' That doesn't exercise the face. FujiwaranoKamayatsu Give it a try. It's real effective. l'll pass. FujiwaranoKamayatsu Fu... What? What's up, professor? Quiet. l can't breathe! ??? No way. You dishonor the Fujiwara founder. I don't understand but I'm sorry, anyway. Now what? My funeral photo. I read online that one should have one ready. Save a lot of headache later. Living is hard, but things don't get any easier after death. I know it'll leave you disabled, but it'll lengthen your life. And that's if it goes well. I don't want to live to be a burden on people. Well, I'd rather have my only cousin live. You can survive without me. You're strong. That's not the point. You've changed. Yeah? Does she know? The girl you're dating? lt's not her problem. Tell me why. Why won't you say it? Don't you love me? Love lives for that, you know. I'd even accept a halfhearted attempt. Give it a shot. I'd like to be alone today. Well, l love you! I'm not afraid to say it! As loud as l can! ln a long email! In the look on my face, color of my nails, my dress! I'll express my love for you every way l can! Not Maki. Yes, it was. No, no way. Yes way. Who then? it was you. Tomoko spilled it. Naoko? Hey, Naoko! Where've you been lt's okay, Tomoko. Yeah. Join us for lunch, Rio... l'm sorry, Rio. Maki! Naoko! It's your fault! You took Rio from me! Rio! Naoko! Naoko! Stay away! Naoko! don't! Come here! lt's too late! Why? My mom's boyfriend... l killed the bastard! What? He kept... ...molesting me. Over and over. But l couldn't... ... tell that hag.. my mom. Naoko. He dumped her yesterday. Know what she said? She said it was my fault. No. It makes you wonder why I was ever born. I guess I was a mistake from the beginning. Stop it! Nobody's a mistake! You weren't a mistake, Naoko! You're kind, Rio. I've always adored you. I didn't have any real friends before you. l'm sorry. l really am. Don't be. You made me feel wanted for once. You were my idol, Rio. It doesn't matter how I was with you. I was just glad to be with you. Naoko! Naoko! Naoko... Don't, Naoko. No one's over there. I'm here! You belong here. Naoko! Naoko! Naoko, please! See? Everyone's calling you. l'm sorry. Well? Cool, huh? l knew it. lt looks rad on me. Rio... Thanks for everything. l loved you. Naoko! Naoko! Rio! Think about it! Rio, stop! I've got to tell Tomoko. I can't keep hiding it! You want Tomoko to end up like Naoko? I won't let that happen. Rio! Tomoko! Rio! Guys? What's up? Listen, Tomoko... You caught me. I wanted to make this picture a surprise. When It's finished, it'll be my present to you all. Tomoko, I've got to tell you about Naoko. Okay. I ordered Naoko to bully you. She never hated you or anything like that. What? I don't understand. It was awful. I'm so sorry. How could you do something like that!? I'm sorry. I don't expect you to forgive me. You, too? No! It was all my doing. No, it wasn't. We went along with it. l feel so stupid. What an idiot l am! Tomoko... good morning.. Rio! Maki, Miho... What happened? How're you feeling, Rio? You passed out from stress. You're supposed to rest. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Tomoko. Thanks, Tomoko. Did something happen, Rio? The professor left. What? How so? ??? No letter? Or phone number? What? Is he out of his mind? No excuse. lt's my punishment. For all my cruelty. For making Tomoko suffer... for pushing away Naoko. l deserved it. l've been wondering. Why you kept me in your circle. Why you threw yourself on me to protect me from Naoko. My old friends never even tried to help me when I was bullied. You may have lied, but you saved me twice. So I vowed that someday I would return the favour This is my chance. Tomoko. Tell us, Sir. Where did the man in that old house on 6th Street move to? A guarantor's name on his lease would do. I really can't tell you that. It's confidential information. Don't be that way, Boss. You've put me in a bind here. Let's just party. That stubborn old pervert. We'll break him tomorrow. Too few clues. Try again tomorrow. Right. What? Who's that? Don't tell me... ...it's Kaori. Kaori! Who're you? Are you Kaori? Yes. Do l know you? You've come to see Rio? No. What're you here for? Regular checkup. She's hiding a pineapple! l did not. Why the pineapple then? Why not? lt's unnatural. Whatever. Go and see Rio. No, thanks. ??? Rio's still madly in love with the professor. Seriously. Dead serious. Let her see him. This is for you. Thank you. How're you feeling? He's got to absorb himself in his research. l see. That photo. It's the photo that brought us together. The moment l saw it... It was like an electric shock ran through me. My mind went blank. My friends laughed at me, saying it was love. He made me want to start my life over again. And I felt like spending it entirely with him. But he didn't feel that way. The harder you love, the more it hurts. Yes, it hurts like hell. But that's how a woman learns her fate. Don't say you heard it from me. Kouki's new address. Go prove your love. But l... You can decide when you see him. I didn't think you'd come. Your friends pushed me for 15 hours. Good friends. Yeah. Too good for me. you out of fear you'd hate me. If I did, you'd pull farther away. I'm resigned to anything. Your friends would keep hounding me anyway. 3 years ago, something happened that turned me bad. I was kind only to those I could use. ln the end... I hurt those who cared for me. That was all before I met you. What happened 3 years ago? When l was 1 4... I was raped, and got pregnant. My parents insisted... ... that I abort the child, of course. From then on... I felt I'd rather hurt people than be hurt by them. Did that help? It showed me there were worse things than being hurt.. a million times more painful. I can't believe it took 17 years to learn that. l see. But you're no longer the same person. You've been through a lot. You have friends. You're not alone. and compassion... hurt you now. Professor, the truth is I still... I've started a new research project at this school. It's a great environment. l'm real happy. Yes. Of course. I just wanted to say thanks. That's all I planned to do. l'm so pathetic. You okay? Yeah. Hang in there. You, too. Bye. Wait! Stop the bus! Professor! Kouki Ozawa, 35. He arrived unconscious His body was convulsing but stopped in transit. Can you hear me, Mr. Ozawa? Brain scan and 1 amp of saline diluted Alleviatin. Are you Mr. Ozawa's family? l'm Ozawa. Sister? please call them. Is my brother going to be okay? We'll explain in detail later. In all frankness, it doesn't look good. See this white ring? It's a malignant tumor. Brain surgery 3 years ago couldn't remove all of it. It was only a matter of time. Wait. What you're.. saying is.. ... my brother's going to die? You should value your time together as a family. Hiya! Rio. Care package delivery! Thanks. This might be clutter but.. ...you might want it. lt's clutter. I just realized something. Those photos you took were for your funeral? Well... no... you might die. You're too prepared! lt wasn't that. l suppose so. Care for a pineapple? Since when did you become my little sister? Hey, Bro! Stop it. I never said I was your sister. You implied it. Really? Well, if you plan on dying, I'll kill you. I see. So I die either way. I never expected this in my wildest dreams. time l had left to live. I was a walking corpse of 35. and then a girl appeared. Said her name was Rio. Pushy, aggressive... yet delicate. Kindhearted and beautiful. What man... ...myself included... ... wouldn't fall in love with you? But I thought, "Uhoh, I'd better try hard to resist." lt would be stupid... ... for a man facing death to start something new. And yet... l was wrong. With your arrival, my life... ...grew warm, humorous and tender. Just in time. l never felt more alive. So it's ironic that you should come along.. .. and give my life meaning. Thank you. You're an idiot. Our encounter is just a beginning! lt's much more! l'll be much more! Take it easy. I won't stop being selfishly dramatic! Rio. How do you do that? Live with such passion. Don't you even know? lt's 'cause l met you. Kouki... ...you brought me light. I was supposed to die quietly. Since meeting you, I actually... ...began wishing for... ...more time. I want more time with you. Professor, please. have the operation. Stay with me. No. Why not? I may not even know who you are. What meaning is there if I forget? It's okay. I'll remember everything. I may be paralyzed. It'll be a big burden on you. That's okay... as long as you're alive. I'll be even more difficult with people than I am now. I told you... that's my specialty. Okay. But promise me one thing. No matter what... ...even if l die... .. you keep looking straight ahead and live. Stay true to yourself. Don't waver. I'll be watching to make sure. Okay. l promise. Here. No limit. Please start getting ready. Okay. lt'll go great. Yeah. Rio... l love you. What's that about? Love lives to be expressed, right? l was tired of waiting. Even the weather celebrates. Graduates, parents, guardians.. ...congratulations. We've owe his great milestone in life.. to each and everyone of you. Hello. Hello. Um... Yes? I um.. rushed out so fast. And forgot my umbrella. Coud I join you as far as the station? Of course. What a downpour, huh? Yes. But l like rainy days. You do? Thank you. You're welcome. Where to? Tokyo. I see. Well.. I live that way. Yes. Say! Uh... thank you. l was wondering... Yes? That is, if l may... Yes? l'm... Kouki! Nozomi Sasaki Shosuke Tanihara
