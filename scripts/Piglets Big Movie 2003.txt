Ohh. Like the best honey tree|that a bee will ever see. Ha. - Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!|- Oh, boy. Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! Rabbit, what are you doing? Oh, can't you tell? I'm lullabying the bees|for our big plan. They seem to like Bee-thoven. Eeyore, what are you doing? I got to use my big voice... to tell the bees|about the new hive. Buzz, buzz. Great new hive. Tigger, could you tell me|what you're doing? I have to hold the fake hive|hive enough for the bees to see. It's the biggest part|of the plan. Hoo. That's what Tiggers do best.|Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo. You do seem bigger than usual. Oh, hello, Piglet. Pooh, what are you all doing? Harvesting honey, of course. It's all in the plan. the bees with beautiful music. into their new hive. for the bees to see. And then comes the best part. from their old hive. Ha ha. Can I help you|with your big plan? Well, thank you, Piglet,|but, um, perhaps another time. When we have|a bit smaller of a plan... or when you're|a bit bigger of a Piglet. I'm sorry, Piglet... this is a very big plan. Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Places, everyone. I've gotten their attention. Oh! Aah! Great new hive. Free rent. Buzz, buzz. Oh, do the bees know the plan? Piglet, don't get|in the way of our big plan. I'm getting kind of|itchy around my leaves. Oh, d-d-dear! - Oh, buzz.|- Oh! Get the little guy. Oh! Aha! Ohh! Ohh. OK, Rabbit. We're geniuses. Sticky geniuses. Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, goodness. Oh, the sweet taste of success. Mm-mmm. Our plan worked perfectly. Didn't think it would work... but it did. Congratulations to us all. Hoo hoo hoo hoo!|Hooray for Pooh! - And Rabbit.|- And Eeyore. And Tigger, too. But--but I was the... Oh, Piglet... I'm sorry that you couldn't be|part of our big plan. Oh, but I thought I... For a minute there, I thought|I was gonna break out in hives. Oh, dear. Even my shadow is small. Oh, it'd sure be nice|if my friends needed me. Piglet, could you help me|lullaby the bees? Piglet, could you help me|call them to the hive? Yeah, Piglet,|could you help me reach higher? Piglet, we need your help. Ahh. Wonderfullest honey. Oh, I thought Tiggers|hated honey. Well, they do to eat,|but to stop the itching... oh, there is|nothing betterer. - Whoo hoo hoo hoo!|- Oh. Did you hear something? I'm afraid I've got|some honey in my ears. What's that, Pooh? I can't hear you|over all that buzzing. Who's buzzing? Bees! What say we break for lunch? But what about our honey? It's your honey or your life. Hmm. - Come on!|- Oh, boy. - Whoo hoo hoo!|- Oh, bother! Here they come! Aah! Aah! Ooh! Ooh! Run! Oh, joy. - Thanks, donkey boy.|- Mm-hmm. - Thanks, Eeyore.|- Anytime. - Thank you, Eeyore.|- You're welcome. Aah! make a beeline for Piglet's! Oh! Oh! Faster! Run faster! Faster! I can't stand it! They're going to get us!|Get the door! The door! Ooh! Hurry! Ohh! Oh, they're gone. Or maybe just pretenderin'. You know,|bees are sneaky like that. I was right. Eeyore. You got stung out there? No. I got stung right here... where I can keep an eye on it. Is everyone all right? Uh, Tigger's here.|Eeyore's here. Pooh is here. I'm here. Hmm. Who am I forgetting? I don't know, Rabbit.|Let's ask... Piglet! Oh, bother. Are you all right, Pooh? I just landed on my, um... self. Say, what do we have here? Oh, please, Tigger. It's just|a drawing in a scrapbook. But it reminds me... I ever had. Ahem. the day little Piglet... caught his first Heffalump. That was no Heffalump. with a jar on his head. I forgot how much|I look like a Heffalump... with a jar on my head. Ohh. He captured Rabbit, all right. Oh, let me see! Heh. That doesn't look|a thing like me. Oh... what's next? - What's that tiny pink dot?|-I believe it's Piglet. Piglet? Where is Piglet? We must've lost track of him|after we got chased by the bees. Ohh, but he's so little. He could be in big danger. We have to find him|and make sure he's all right. But how will we find him?|He could be anywhere. Ohh... think, think, think. You know, since this is a book|of Piglet's memories... maybe it remembers|where Piglet is. Oh, brilliant deduction there,|Pooh boy. It's a regular Piglet map.|Hoo hoo! That's the silliest thing|I've ever heard. Let's start with page one. Well, page one remembers|Owl's house. Heh heh heh. Way to go, Pooh boy! Why, I bet that little fella's|there right now. Let's go find him! Then off to Owl's house we go. He has an answer|for everything. Not to Owl's. Oh, no.|We'll be there all day. You can never|get a word in edgewise. Good-bye, honey. I may be small... but in the biggest,|helpfullest way! Eeyore? Where are you? Tigger? Where are you? Oh, no. The bees! Oh! Ohh! What can I do? Well, I did help you|get the haycorn... and bring you across the river. Maybe my friends need me. I have to find them. Owl, have you seen Piglet? Piglet? Heh heh.|Of course I've seen Piglet-- many times. He's about so high,|with little pink ears-- No, no, no. We mean now! Have you seen him this morning? Hmm. I can't imagine|that he's changed that much. Ohh. De do do do do do. This is the part|where Owl goes on for a while. As a matter of fact,|I just saw him go by. He was just here?|Shh. Come on. Let's go. ...before he's missing. of course... which is... - Ohh.|- As I was saying... I have some great stories... about my second cousin Rupert,|who stowed away on a... Eeyore, come on! As I was saying,|the great expedition-- what an expedition it was. I told you|this was a silly idea. But he was just at Owl's. The scrappity book|does know where he's going! Well, Owl's house|was on page one. How about page two? Which is a picture of... Kanga's house. Well, then, Kanga's house|is where we'll look for Piglet. I think you must be right,|Rabbit. Piglet has always liked|visiting Kanga's. Not always. There was one time I remember. Oh, yes. When Kanga and Roo... first moved|to the Hundred Acre Wood. Remember, Rabbit? Uh, n-no.|I, uh, I don't seem to recall. Here,|this'll remind your rememberer. - Hoo hoo!|- Ohh. And you came up|with a big plan, Rabbit. I told you-- I don't remember. There it is. if I remember correctly... is really about Piglet. Well, I just don't like it. I don't like it at all. until they're out. Out of the Hundred Acre Wood. - Rabbit...|- Shh! Isn't it a bit early|to be spying? anything like it. Oh, it's actually moving in! Ohh! Ohh! Roo. Roo, dear? Here I am, mama! Ha ha ha. It's an invasion! they're f-f-fierce? Ha ha! What does fierce look like? That's what fierce looks like! She swallowed him whole! Ohh! Uhh! Ohh, d-d-dear. He'll be eaten for sure. Ohh, are you all right? Blaaah! Don't eat me! Why, you must be Piglet. My, when Christopher Robin|said you'd be dropping by... I had no idea. You know Christopher Robin? Oh, yes.|He told us all about you... and Pooh and Rabbit and Tigger. The ones hiding|in that tree over there. Hello, dears. Did you hear that?|She called us dears. I'm Kanga, and somewhere|around here is baby Roo. I'm not a baby! - See? I can do this!|- Ohh! Well, it's very nice of you... to welcome us. - Ha ha ha!|- Aah! Oops. Sorry. Oh, Roo. Piglet,|it's almost breakfast time. Would you like to come in|for a little bite, perhaps? Aaah! l do like the sound|of the taste of that. Uh, no, no, no. We're all due|on the other side of the wood... and we can't be late. Good-bye. Good-bye! Might I, uh, get|that little something to go? Come on! Aren't they dears? One--Pooh will distract Kanga... long enough for two-- Tigger and I|to take Roo from her pouch... and three--|replace him with Piglet. That is very simple.|Just three little steps and-- What?!|Replace Roo w-w-with m-m-me? You and Roo are the same size,|give or take here or there. Kanga won't know|the difference. Ha ha. Not until it's too late. Ha ha. How much too late? Until after we say, ''Aha!'' What do you think? Huh? Hmm? Ahh? Hmm? ''Ha ha''?|Why would we say, ''Ha ha''? Not ''Ha ha,'' Piglet. ''Aha.'' It's a word to say... ''This is how things are|and were meant to be.'' Then Kanga will know|that we know where Roo is... and we'll only give him back... if she promises to leave|the Hundred Acre Wood... and never return. Ha ha. How is she gonna know that|that is what our aha-ing means? Because we'll practice|saying it in just the right way. We're counting on you, Piglet. Now everyone pretend|that their flower is Kanga. Ha ha. Ready? Set. There you all are. Oh, you brought flowers! What nice new neighbors. Heh. Uhh! - Ahem.|- All right, I'm goin'! Roo, dear! Time to come inside! In a minute, mama! Ready, Pooh? Yes.|Except for one small thing. - What's that?|- What is it I'm supposed to do? Oh! Talk to her very hard... so that she doesn't|notice anything. Oh, of course. Heh heh. Come on, Roo.|Hop in. Let's go inside. Oh, Kanga! Um, talk to her|very hard about what? Anything! I was just wondering... uh, that is...|do you think that... is that a fish in that tree? - Oh!|- Which tree, dear? Up there. Snug as a piggy in a blanket. What are you playing,|Mr. Rabbit? That's not a fish, Pooh bear.|It's a bird. Oh, yes, but is it|a starling or a mackerel? Ohh, it looks kinda wiggly. Hmm. It's tough to say. If you'll forgive me, dear,|we really must be going. Kind of a peanut butter|and jellyfish, isn't it? Whoa, whoa! Wait, frog! - Aah! Oh, no!|- Yippee! Whoo! - Yecch! Ptoo!|- Let's do it again! This is a fun game! Ohh. Are you all right|in there, Roo? I'm OK. I'm OK! All right, Roo, dear. Yahoo! - Ha ha! This is fun!|- Slow down! Rabbit? Oh, Roo. Wooh-ha...booh-ha? Uh...uh...ha ha. Um... what was that word? - Aha?|- That's the word. Ah-haah! Aaah! Help! Tigger, Tigger! Pooh bear! You've lost your bounce. Tigger! Pooh bear! I think it's time|for your fishy oil. Fishy oil? What fishy oil? It'll help you bounce|nice and high. You don't want to grow up|small and weak, like Piglet. Now, did you have something|you wanted to tell me... Roo? -Uh, no--|- Down the hatch! Ptoo! Blecch! See that?|You got your bounce back. a good little Roo... another spoonful. No-o-o! Oh, dear. I'm a goner! Aaah! You act like I'm going|to cook you for dinner. A-a-aren't you? Why, of course not. Ohh! l'm going to give you a bath. Aah! Cook me instead! Don't you know by now... always knows what's best? Whew ! Aah! Aah! Ah-choo! Oh, my goodness! Aah! Whee! Ha ha ha! Whee! Ha ha ha! Now, you know what's next. I'm afraid to find out. There's always two things|you get after your bath. A cookie. Mwah. And a kiss... Piglet. Oh. Well,|it's a very subtle distinction. But you see, a jellyfish|sounds more like a-- ''Blblblblbl! ''Hi, I'm a jellyfish!''|Kinda like that. Tigger, Tigger! Pooh bear! Another creature|of the fiercerest kind! Rabbit was right. But it's me--Piglet! Nah, the Piglet we know|isn't half as fuzzy as you. Why, you can't pull the fluff|over our eyes! Pooh, t-tell him who I am. Well, I'd love to...|whoever you are. Come to think of it,|he might be... a fuzzy-fringed thingamaw hatsis. Ohh. No, no, no. This is|more of the feather-furred... frizzamabobble variety. But can we be sure, Tigger? Oh! I'll prove it to you! Piglet,|where did you come from? Lucky thing that fuzzy-fringed|thingamabob didn't get you. What did you find out? Was she awfully fierce|and fiercefully awful? At first, I thought so,|but then I found out... she's very nice. Hello, dears. Oh, she called us dears again.|Ha ha! I could get used to this. Would you like to come in|for that little something now? I'd love to.|I love little somethings. - But what do we tell Rabbit?|- Wheeee! Ha ha! Mama, look at me! Roo! You gotta see|Mr. Rabbit's garden! Oh, you hear that?|Mr. Rabbit. Ha ha. It's got carrots|and lettuce and beets... and we played leap bunny-- All right. Settle down, dear. Now , what do we say|to Mr. Rabbit? Thank you, Mr. Rabbit.|I had fun. Well, I, uh, certainly|enjoyed myself, too... and you can call me Rabbit. I like you, Rabbit. I like you, too, Roo. Aha! You're right, Piglet. This is the way things are|and were meant to be. if it weren't for Piglet... I wouldn't be friends with Roo. And we'd never have found out|how nice Kanga was. We'd never have|any of Kanga's songs. Or her hugs. Or her cookies, which my nose|is telling my tummy-- are right nearby. Heh heh. Kanga!|We're so glad you didn't leave! What are you talking about,|Tigger? How Piglet took a bath for us. Not just any old buddy... for his friends. Don't know if I would. It was a very biggish thing... for a littleish guy to do. And we're ever so worried|about him, you see... because we lost him|at the honey harvest... of memories to find him... we hope. Ohh, dear, Piglet. But he's so small.|He could be in big danger. Mama, may I help them|look for Piglet? Oops. Sorry, Eeyore. Can I, mama? Can I? Piglet needs your help. Pooh, would you like|a cookie before you go? Oh, my heart tells me I should|keep looking for Piglet. Oh, but you dears|will need something... to keep your strength up. My tummy says yes. Oh, I just thought|Piglet would need... to keep his strength up, too. - Bye, mama.|- Bye-bye, dear. So, where do we look first? The scrapbook|will give us an idea. It's a book of memories.|It remembers where Piglet is. Try page three. Page three shows all of us|at the North Pole. the day we made... discovery of all. Then that's where we shall look. But this is not the way|to the North Pole. Well, last time, if|I reconnoiter correctically... the north pole was sort of|in a south-down-easterly... kind of over and down|direction this way... magnellically speaking. No. Last time we went this way. No. That would be|the Northeast Pole. - No, no, no, and no.|- Don't be ridiculous. I know what I'm talking about .|It's this way. I--don't interrupt. Perhaps if we told the story... the story will tell us|how to get there. the part about Piglet. How does Piglet fit in? Oh, Roo's right. about Piglet, isn't it? Nine-itty-eight,|nine-itty-nine... seventy-two-itty|and thirteen-itty... and forty-six-itty... and one whole hundred... gravity-defiant,|Tiggerific bounces. Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Look out below! Hmm. Aah! Heh heh heh heh. Hello, Tigger. Hello, Piglet. Oh. What are you doing? for the other shoe to plop. I knew it. Hoo hoo! These|things always travel in pairs. These are Christopher Robin's|big boots. They can mean only one thing. An expedition. Yahoo hoo hoo hoo! Um, which petition? Yes. An expedition. It's when you go off|to find a thing. What are w going to find,|Christopher Robin? The North Pole. Is it scary? What is the North Pole? Yeah. Come to think of it, we|never found one of them before. Well, it's a thing you discover. Are bears good|at discovering it? - And Tiggers?|- Everyone will come along. And if you see the North Pole,|shout, ''Eureka!'' - Oof!|- Why would we do that? ''There's the North Pole.'' Eureka! Where? - Where?|- Gesundheit. Sorry. I--I was just practicing. We need a marching song. A marching song|to help us along. This is fun. One more time! I like that song. Ha ha ha ha ha. Silly old bear. Would you like a haycorn, Pooh? No, thank you, but a cookie|would be nice. Ha. Or a banana. Ow! Christopher Robin... perhaps I could find it easier|if only I was sure. That is, if I knew|what the North Pole looked like. Mmm. Well, it's kind of... It's sort of, well... I suppose we'll know exactly|what it is when we see it. Are we there yet? Whoa! Pooh! Ho ho... I just fed my tummy,|and it's still calling me. Ha ha ha! Hey, look at me, Pooh! Oh, I am. Pooh, I'm swimming! Just a moment, Roo.|I'm talking to my tummy. Well, of course you're swimming. You shouldn't have had|that second cookie. That's not your stomach, Pooh.|It's Roo! Oh, my!|Roo, I don't believe... expeditions|usually go into the water. Quick! Don't panic, Kanga.|Everything's fine here! Nobody's in any kind of a--|especially not Roo! Ha ha! Do something! Everyone--do anything! Don't worry, Roo, boy!|I'll save ya! Thanks, Tigger,|but I don't think I need saving. I can help! Piglet, stay here out of the way|while we save Roo! We don't want to have|to rescue two little guys! Catch onto my tail, Roo. I'll pull ya out. Just tell me when you're on. Oops! Oh! Rabbit, Roo?|Are we going swimming? Hey! Maybe we can use this|to save Roo! Give me a push, Pooh! Thank you, Piglet. Ha ha. Now I've got him! Faster, Pooh! Faster! Pooh? W ere is he, Rabbit? Pooh! Look the other way! from here! Are you sure, Rabbit? You're right. You can see better from up here.|There he is! - Aah!|- Oh! Ha ha ha! Whoa! Roo, are you OK? I gotcha, Roo! I gotcha! Here he is, Kanga! Ta-da! Oh... where'd he go? - My Great Uncle Rupert...|- Pooh bear? Pooh bear! Pooh bear! I'm gettin' kinda tired. Use the pole! Use the pole! No time for fishing, Piglet!|We gotta save Roo! Grab on, Roo! - Hee hee hee!|- Pooh, could you hold this? Hee hee hee... Did you see me swimmin'? That's called swimmin',|what I was doing. Pooh bear! Pooh bear!|Where did you find that stick? What , uh, stick? That stick! Well, I was standing here|without a stick... and then I had a stick, so... maybe the stick found me. Assembled adventurers,|the expedition is over... for Pooh has discovered|the North Pole! - This?|- That. Eureka! Hoo hoo! Well, I'll be. That's the North Pole,|all right, all righty! I should have seen it myself! But--but--oh... well... eureka! - Eureka!|- Yay! Hooray for Pooh! - Polerific!|- Hooray! Positively magnetic! Goodness! Where's Eeyore? Did ya grab on yet, Roo? Roo? Somebody. Anybody? Hooray for Pooh. I always liked that story. It has such a lovely end. But nobody said|hooray for Piglet. He was so brave... for someone so small. hate water. Hoo hoo. Come to think of it,|so do Tiggers. W-y-yooouh! Wha-ha! Thank you, tail! Thank you, Piglet,|wherever you are. Look! Piglet's scarf! That's it! Come on, let's go! Missed him again. Oh, my. You know Piglet's scarf never|goes anywhere without Piglet. Oh! This is|more serious than I thought! Maybe he's in grave danger. Maybe Heffalumps got him! - Heffalumps?|- Or--or Woozles! W-Woozles? And now|he's out there somewhere... And now|he's out there somewhere... with a storm brewing in. Oh, goodness! Goodness! Do you think|he's gonna be all right? Piglet shall be|very all right, indeed. Don't let his small size|worry you. Yep. Once he even made|a whole house. He did? Do you know the story|of The House at Pooh Corner? Mmm... no. - Oh, yes. It's right here.|- Page three. On page four. That's after three. Oh, It's a lovely tale.|Don't you think so, Tigger? - Tigger?|- Huh? - Pooh Corner. Remember?|- Oh, yeah! Is this story|about Piglet, too? Why, yes, Roo, it is. He seems to be the hero|of every story. Goodness! I was just thinking, Pooh... Oh! Were you thinking of a way|to keep warm? Actually, I was thinking... about how you have a house|and I have a house... and Rabbit and Owl... and Christopher Robin|all have houses... but poor Eeyore has nothing. Well, that's certainly|something we could think about. Hmm... - Think, think, think. Hmm...|- Think, think, think. l'v e got it! Whoa--oh! Got what? we'll build Eeyore|a house of his own! Oh, that's a wonderful idea,|Pooh! But where shall we build it? Well... right here. Because this is where|I thought of it. And since this is where|I thought of it... we shall call this place|Pooh Corner. Pooh Corner? Uh, Pooh, I was thinking|along with you. Yes, that's true, Piglet. So we could call this place|Pooh and Piglet Corner... if Pooh Corner|didn't sound better... which it does, being smaller|and more like a corner. So, Pooh Corner it is. Look! Snow somersaults!|Hoo hoo hoo! Whoa! Whoa-oa-oa! Bother. You know, I tried to stop,|but it's snow use. Get it? Snow use! Hoo hoo hoo! So, whatcha doin'? We're going to build Eeyore|a house at Pooh Corner. What a tickerific idea! Hoo hoo! Whatcha going to build it with? Uh, we haven't decided. Say! I just bounced by|a humongerous pile of sticks! They'd be positively perfect|for a donkey house! Come on! Bounce this way!|Hoo hoo hoo! Follow the bouncing Tigger! What did I tell ya? More sticks|than you can stick a shake at. Gee, it's almost as if|someone left them here for us. Whoo--ooh--whoo! I wonder... Naw! Now let's get started,|so we can finish in time. Uhh!|In time for what? Ah! Lunch. Hello! There. It's all entirely done. Let's show old donkey boy|the fruits of our elbow grease. Oh, bother. I suspect-erate|there's something... definitely wrong|with these sticks. All we wanted was for Eeyore|to have his own house. You know,|Eeyore could come live with me. That is very hospiticious|of you, Pooh. Let's go give|old donkey boy the good news! Hoo hoo hoo hoo-hoo! Oh, dear. Hello! Pooh bear!|Oh, you're just in time! Look what O made. Why, Christopher Robin. It's wonderful! What is it? Why, it's you, Pooh bear. he looks so familiar. He looks just like you! Except, of course,|for the donkey head. Eeyore, were you under there|the whole time? I suppose I was. Weren't you awfully cold|under there? I've been colder. Last night, for instance,|it got downright-- Freezing. So I did it.|I built myself a house. Did ya hear that?|Eeyore built himself a house! Just a leaky pile of sticks. Did you say... sticks? So you have seen it. l have? Seen what? You know, the funny thing|about houses... is, uh, well,|they never know... if they're comin' or goin',|and so they do. Well, someone somewhere|must know something. I do ! What's that? pig highfaluter! it's Piglet on stilts. Eeyore's house is over there. Come on. I-I'll show you. Toodle-oo. Look at that! Well, I'll be... Oh, my goodness! Welcome home, Eeyore.|Hee hee hee. Whoa-oh... Whoa! Whaa-- Whoaaa! Hmm... it's my house, all right. But I'm sure|this isn't where I built it. Where you built it?|But--but--I-- Hmm. I suppose the wind|must have blown it over here. The wind? Oh, yeah, the wind. Oh, well, it's been known to do|strange and windy-like things. I think the wind|had a little help. Right, Piglet? The important thing is,|Eeyore has a house... and here it is,|and it's as good as ever. And even never betterer. You really think so? Oh, yes. Much more better|than ever, even, Piglet. Just one thing bothers me. Oh, dear. What might that be? 'Fraid I'll lose it again. Don't w rry, Eeyore.|I put up a sign... so you'll always know|where it is. See? ''Pooh Corner.'' Nice. Hooray for Eeyore's house! Hooray for Eeyore's house! What? It's a little crowded... but it'll do. And that is how|Piglet got the idea... that you, Eeyore,|should have your own house. You mean Piglet built|Eeyore's house all by himself? Yes, and that's just|how much Piglet cares. Uh-huh. Best house I ever had. And named it after me.|Oh. Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet, Piglet. Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Ah-choo! Oh, dear. We better find him soon.|Roo's getting cold. Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Well, perhaps we should|look in the book again. Hey, I just got|a Tiggerific idea. Let's see where the book ends|and go there. - What do you think?|- No, no, no. lf we do this|in an orderly manner... we'll find him much quicker. Now, let's see.|We've been there and there... But orderlier doesn't seem|to be working, does it? All I'm concerned about|is finding Piglet. Well, I want to find him, too. We all want to find him! Rabbit, look! Oh, bother. - Rabbit, the book!|- Oh, my. You're ruining it, Rabbit! I am not. Hand it over, bunny boy. Finding Piglets|is what Tiggers do best. lt's what Rabbits do best. - Tiggers!|- No, Rabbits. - Tiggers!|- Rabbits! - No, Tiggers!|- Rabbits! - Stop it! Stop fighting!|- Oh, be careful. Rabbits! That's the only way|we have to find Piglet. Oh, no! There goes our map. And Piglet's memories. I only wanted to find Piglet. We all did. Oh, dear.|We better go back to Piglet's. warm and dry. Oh, I do wish I had called it|Pooh and Piglet Corn--oh. That's the Piglet I know -- always glad to see you. - Always thoughtful.|- Always brave. - Mm-hmm.|- Never thinking of himself. Draw another one, Pooh. We got to go get Piglet! Let's go find Piglet, indeed. - Let's go.|- Let's go. Uhh! Oh, poor Piglet. Oh. Oh, goodness. Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet! Piglet? Look. Oh, look what I found. scrapbook pages. Look, another one. Maybe we could put Piglet's|scrappity book back together. Then we can find him|in no time. Well, let's keep looking. I found one! Me, too. Me, too. Aha! Eureka! - I think...|- I found... Another other! - Here's one.|- Wonderful. We're getting closer. Here's one.|How many does that make? Look, here's another one. -What's that over there? Uhh! Come back, memory! Hoo hoo hoo! Ohh! Guhh! Ooh! One more scrappy page|for Piglet's scrappity book. Hey, look, there it is. But how will we get it? Oh, we need help. That's got to be dangerous.|What could he be thinking? - Who?|- Pooh. No. Now, now, no one panic. The first thing we do|is not to panic because-- Somebody do something!|Do anything! Uhh! Oh, my goodness! Stay calm. Everybody calm. Don't panic. Oh, my goodness. Have you lost your mind? What are you doing? I'm just getting|Piglet's memories. Oh, bother. Pooh needs our help! Oh! Oh, bother, bother. Rabbit was right.|We could use a little help. Here you go, buddy boy. We made you a rescue rope!|Hoo hoo hoo hoo! - Out of us!|- Me, too. It's our plan. Ohh. Ohh. Oh, my. Pooh, what are you waiting for? The rescue rope isn't rescuing. - We need a little bit more.|- We just need a little help. - Who's small enough?|- Oh, dear. Who can help? - Piglet! Oh!|- Piglet. - Piglet!|- Piglet!

We--we never got|to tell Piglet... how we feel about him. Poor Pooh. Should've told them|when we had the chance. Ohh. Ohh! Oh! Here you go, R-Rabbit. Something must be very sad. Well, of course it's sad. - Pooh?|- Pooh? Piglet! Oh, thank goodness you're safe. We're so glad to see you. - Glad to see me?|- Oh, yes. It's so good|to have you back again. Yeah. We've been|following your memories... all over|the Hundred Acre Wood... and they led us right to you. Too bad they're all|floating down the river. Oh, goodness. - Oh, no.|- Oops. Oh, bother. We're ever so sorry, Piglet. Aw, the scrapbook's|not that important. But it showed us|the great things you've done. Oh, l've never done|anything great. Well, of course you have.|Let's tell him, everyone. No. Let's show him. That's a wonderful idea. Come on. Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Hurry! I don't know|if I stand the excitement. - Here we are.|- Ho ho.

Oh, dear. - Where's Pooh?|- Piglet! Piglet, I have|one more thing to show you. But, Pooh, your cake. It can wait. Hurry, Piglet. We shall have|a little something... right after I show you|a little something, Piglet. It's right over here. Ohh. ''Pooh and Piglet Corner.'' Yes, Piglet. It's the least we could do... for a very small Piglet|who's done such very big things. Thank you, Piglet. This is fun. One more time!
