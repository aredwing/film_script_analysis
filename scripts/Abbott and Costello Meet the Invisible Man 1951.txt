Now, keep quiet. ...detective training And now we graduate from Dugan's Experts in criminology And since they say that crime won't pay We will fight crime with good old D.D.T. Men, I have taught you all I know. You've studied hard and learned well, most of you. You have earned the Dugan Detective Training diploma. And the D.D.T. diploma on an office wall... means a steady stream of clients. Bud Alexander. In accordance with my agreement with the students who graduate... you'll receive a trial with a recognized detective agency. Report to the MacQuillan Agency in the Fort building. Give him this card. Thank you. Louis Francis. Thank you. Thank you! You've been seeing too many Sherlock Holmes pictures lately. Take off that cap.! A detective has to dress so he won't attract much attention. Put that down, that is not a lollipop.! Turn on the police calls. Hurry up, it might tip us off to something. I'm glad MacQuillan gave us the night shift. Maybe we can grab a case and solve it ourselves. We get a tip on a bank robbery, better yet, a murder... and we follow the murderer to his hideout. Yeah. We go to his hideout and we start searching the place. Remember, death lurks in every corner. And suddenly, the murderer comes in. Fellas interested in a case? A case? A case of what? Shh, quiet! You want us to handle a case! Which one of you is MacQuillan? I am. I am. Who's who? He's Mac, I'm Quillan. Just call us Bud and Lou. Attention. Be on the lookout for Tommy Nelson, escaped murderer. He is 5'11", weighs 165, blue eyes, brown hair. When last seen, was wearing dark felt hat, overcoat... Nelson? Isn't that the middleweight... who killed his manager after his last fight? That's what they said. If we weren't taking your case, I'd grab that murderer. I don't think you have to look very far. Keep quiet! blue eyes, sandy hair. Put down... turned-up collar and soft hat. Quiet, the man wants a telephone. If that ain't Tommy Nelson, it's Frankenstein. Frankenstein! Hello, Helen, is anyone around? Good. I must see the doctor at once. I'll be right over. There's money in this for you. How much? Plenty. Take me to 823 Maple St... and I'll tell you all about it. Let's go. That's him. Who? Tommy Nelson. I'd love to get my hands on him. Come on, let's go. I can't see a thing. Turn it around! Bud, I-I-look! What? It's only a moth. Come on! Tommy, I've been so worried. I want to see the doctor right away. Fellas, wait the in library. I'll be right back. Excuse me. She called him Tommy. That's Tommy Nelson, the escaped killer. Stop jumping at conclusions. What would an escaped killer want private detectives for? So he can catch himself? So... Oh, come on! Tommy, is this wise? The police know about you and Helen. This is the first place they'll look. Those men you brought with you... It was my only way of getting here. Can you trust them? If you'd brought the serum, I wouldn't need to trust anybody. What did happen? Did you make up your minds that I killed O'Hara? That's not fair. Uncle Phil's been working on the formula. You told me you had it developed. I do, my boy. You can see for yourself... Pripitane serum was discovered years ago and it works. One injection, and the cell structure becomes transparent. What are you waiting for? Jab me with one of those and the police will never catch me. I'll be free to find out who really killed O'Hara. And inside of a week, you'd be a raving maniac... just like its discoverer, John Griffin. No. I've got to take that chance. Do you want to go insane, as John Griffin did? Shot down like a mad dog as he was? He never regained his visibility until he was dead. When he willed me this formula... I swore I'd never use it until I'd found some safe reagent... some means of bringing a man back... avoiding insanity, perhaps restoring visibility. Doc, unless I clear myself, it means "the chair. " So what difference does it make? Come on, that's a boy! You can make it. Did you see that? What happened? The halfback just ran around his own end. Some trick. We interrupt our program to give you a police bulletin. Have you seen this man? He's Tommy Nelson, escaped murderer. There's a $5,000 reward. If you have any information, phone... What number? Rlver-8-1-8-1. Thank you. You're right, this guy is the killer. Let's get outta here. No, we've got a great case. We'll grab the murderer and get the reward. We can't do that. This guy hired you and I... Nevertheless, he's a rat. Because he killed his manager? Because he didn't tell us there was a reward for him. I'm sorry, Tommy, I can't do it. It's the police. Let's sneak out the back way. Good, let's go. Wait. We're detectives. What am I running for? Am I a crook? You want me to answer that? It's the police. Stall them off and I'll try to get out the back way. All right, men, take your positions. It's a legal search warrant. But it's ridiculous. I've been ridiculous before, beautiful. Roy, you and I'll take the upstairs. Joe, you cover the back. Eddie, you stay right here. We've got to catch Nelson before the cops do... and collect that reward. I'll watch in the hall and you watch here. You ain't gonna do that to me. You watch here and I'll watch in the hall. Okay. That's the same thing! Shh. We've got him. He can't get away. Look. N-N-Now... Bud.! Bud.! Don't worry, he can't get out. Neither can I! Bud! Mr. Nelson, I don't want the reward. I'm for you. Let's shake hands on it. Atta boy. Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! Don't forget, we get the reward. My pal's got him covered. That boy is always on his toes. Well, where is he? Always on his toes, huh? Lou, snap out of it. Come on, boy. I'll give him a whiff of this. Oh, Bud, I want to tell you something. Here's Bud. Hi-ya, Bud. Where did Tommy Nelson go? He disappeared. How did he get out? In installments. Installments? Yeah, he did a Gypsy Rose Lee. That... That's all that's left of him. Evidently Nelson changed clothes. What was he wearing the last time you saw him? Air. Nothin' but air. And then he asked me how he looked. Wearing air? What are you talkin'about? He was standing right here and then I shook hands with him. His hand was gone. I went to speak to him, his head was gone. He took off his shirt, his body was gone. He took off his pants, his legs were gone. Then he spoke to me, I was gone. This guy's a psycho if I've ever seen one. Would you mind coming to the police station... and telling a real nice man just what you told us? Don't you believe what I saw? Sure I do. Things like this happen every day. They do? Where have I been? I don't know where you've been... but I know where you're going. So you let him get away! Now we can't collect the reward. Double-crosser.! You kicked me! And what's the idea of calling me a double-crosser? That wasn't me, that was him. Don't lie! Ow! Break it up. Don't keep the nice man waiting. Come on. I know, you saw this man disappear into space. That's right. Do you always see things? Only when my eyes are open. Have you ever seen anyone disappear before? Yes. My brother. Ah-ha, this may have been the start of seeing things. Tell me about it. My brother and I were walking down the street. All of a sudden, he disappeared. Into thin air? No, into a manhole. Oh! How about voices? Do you ever hear strange voices? Yes, sir. When does this happen? When I get the wrong number on the phone. Oh! Got a headache? Suppose you go over there and lie down. Why? Don't you believe me sittin' here? Would you get over there, please? All right. Here, lie down. Perhaps we can find out something from your subconscious. Tell me, what's wrong with me? Well, you see... Would you get down there? Often the conscious mind will lie... but from the subconscious we get the truth. You know where the subconscious comes from? The subway? Look into my eyes. You're going to sleep. You're going to sleep. Sleep. Sleep. One, two, three, four... What are you doing? I'm countin' cows. Cows? I'm allergic to sheep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. And now you are asleep. I am? Go to sleep. We must find out why you are seeing things. Now, watch this. Concentrate on this. Tick-tock. You forgot to say, "The mouse ran up the clock. " You've got to go to sleep! I can't, I'm too busy looking at this clock. Concentrate on that. We've got to help you. We've got to make you better. First we've got to find out what causes these things. We must find out... What's with that psycho? Nothing yet. Well, find out what's cooking. Okay. Wake up, will ya, please? Wake up. Please wake up. What's happened here? He was trying to put me to sleep with this watch. He kept saying, "Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. " Tick-tock. Tick-tock. You see, officer? I was... Where's your head? Oooh! Wonder what the doc is doin' here so late. Somebody's gotta be there. You think anything happened to him? I hope so. Come on, we'll find out. Why don't you all get up? Doc, will you help me to get them up? Will you get up, fellas? Mmm-hmm, tick-tock. Doc! Doc! What's the matter? What happened? You were trying to put me to sleep with your watch. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Oh, no. Give me that watch. Get out of here. Get out of here! Take it easy. Did you find out anything? Yes, once before, he saw his brother disappear. Into thin air? No, into a sewer! A fine detective you are! You not only mess up our first case... but you prove to the cops that you're a moron. I did not, they did. I didn't mean to frighten you. I have a message from Tommy. He wants you to prove that he's innocent. I have a $500 retainer for you. 500 bucks? You're to take this grip to the south end of Riverside Park... that deeply wooded section. Leave the grip there and Tommy will contact you. Here's the $500. We'll get in touch with you at your house. Any messages for Tommy? Yes. Tell Tommy my uncle is working on the reagent. Thanks for the $500. Well, that's that. Now all we... So.! He's invisible, eh? Then why take clothes to him? What are you two cooking up on me? What did this guy give you to escape? Don't lie to me. Ah-ha, just as I thought. You'll get no parts of this $500 or the $500 the dame gave me. That'll teach you to be honest, someday or other. Oh, yeah? No, you don't. No, you don't! You leave that alone! Touch that again, I'll break both of your arms. You take this grip... I told you not to touch it! Give me that bill. Put it there and leave it there. That's better. Now you... Give me that bill. Give me your hand. Put it in my hand like that and leave it there! Take this grip down to the car, and I'll be right with you. Hurry up. Wise guy. Hello, operator? Give me police headquarters. Tommy? Tommy? Here's your grip, Tommy. Was he in there? Yeah, he was unpackin' and I'm packin'. What did you see? An empty woods full ofTommy Nelson. Don't give me that invisible stuff again. Honest. And there were footsteps with no feet. And the grip that was unpackin' itself. All right, let's go. That's some disguise. The cops will never recognize you. I'm not gonna get near any cops. And I'm counting on you guys to help me. You can trust me. Tommy. You can trust me, too. Thanks. Let's shake on it. Come on, let's get out of here! If I'd known it was you, I wouldn't have come. If it's a wild goose chase... There's a sitting duck right in my car. You bag him and I'll bag the reward. I want Tommy Nelson! I got the keys in my pocket. Don't get excited. There's no use you losing your head. Cause, I mean... Oh, Tommy. Not again. Come out with your hands up. What! You again? I knew you'd do something like this. Take me to the station! You gonna see that nice man? Yes, I'm gonna have my head examined. I saw another man in the car when we drove up. And I'll have your head examined, too! Come on. What's your alibi now? He did it again. And you did it again... after me phoning the cops to be here. And you did that again! Now, don't be smart. I told you not to get smart, didn't I? Now, I'll show you who is the boss. No, I'll show you who's boss. Who said that? The voice is familiar, but I can't quite place the face. You brought the cops here and tried to double-cross me again. Oh, no, it's Tommy Nelson. Lou, he's here! - I touched him. - I think he touched you back. If either of you ever cross me again... I'll break every bone in your bodies. Tommy, I didn't do anything. Don't give me excuses. Get in the car. Yes, sir. Not in the front, in the back! Give me the keys. Hurry, the keys! Fine pal you are! Stand there and watch me get beat up. Bud, believe me, I didn't see a thing. Yeah. Boy, I sure scared that guy. If we get in an accident, do you bleed, too? Mr. Nelson, I want to apologize. Okay, from now on, we'll work together. You didn't kill your fight manager, did you? The evidence says I did. When I stepped out of the shower that night... I found O'Hara on the dressing room floor, beaten to death. The officer at the door swore no one else had entered the room. So, they hung it on me. We believe you, Tommy. I forgot to tell you, Miss Grace's uncle is working on the reagent. Without it, I could become a raving maniac... with an uncontrollable urge to kill. He ain't kidding. I hope he's got his driver's license. I hope he's in the car. Pull over to the side. Tell him, he's drivin'. I said, pull over to the... Now, tell it to me again. But I've told you three times. Tell him again! I saw a car with nobody, drivin' somebody. Sorry, Tommy, I didn't know you was behind me. Hey, what're you doin'? Rowin'. I gotta be at Staten Island in twenty minutes. You better hurry, the tide's goin' out. Now, in preparation... for his fight with young Malloy... the leading contender for the middleweight crown... the East Side's favorite son, Rocky Hanlon. He couldn't lick Tommy Nelson. So, that's Rocky Hanlon? Yeah. The night I fought him, my manager O'Hara... and a gambler named Morgan made a deal for me to take a dive. I crossed them and knocked Rocky out in the second round. So, that's why they killed your manager. Yeah. That announcer there. It was Stillwell, he runs this place. I need you guys around the gym to help me out. Tell him you'd like to train here. Leave it to me, Tommy. Mr. Stillwell... In close, Rocky. Watch that jab. That's it. Keep puttin' 'em in there. Keep that left up. Keep him workin'. Morgan, the colonel's down front. It ain't smart if it gets around that you own Rocky. I know what I'm doin'. This fight will put us all in the blue chips. Yeah? That's what you said before Rocky fought Tommy Nelson. This time there'll be no slipup. Malloy dives in the sixth round. Does his manager understand? I keep asking him if he does. Keep asking him if he knows what happened to O'Hara. Beat it. You don't look like much of a fighter to me. You can train him here as long as you pay me. Thanks. In case a substitute is needed on a fight card... should I give him a bout? Sure. Give me a bout? Give me about Listen. We told him you were a fighter. You've gotta live up to the name. I'm no fighter. What's the difference? Look, watch this. Tommy... you here? Yeah, this is our first move. Stick close to that bag and I'll do the rest. I've never seen anything like him. Why, the little guy's wonderful. You're missin' the greatest exhibition I've ever seen... look! Stay down. Stay down. Great stuff, fella. You punch a bag just like Tommy Nelson. That's what I've been tellin' myself. Steve, get a picture of this fella. Wait a minute! I made 40 grand last year. What was your take? About 10% of that. Then pay attention to me. You, make with the camera. He's ready to blow up. Start workin' on him. Just a minute, chum. This butterball could smear you all over the map. Bud, don't say that. I'll repeat it. He can smear you all over the map. That's it. Steam him up. While he's doin' that, what do you think I'll be doin'? Smearin' my map all over the place. You said it. Shove off. Shove off? That's sailor talk, like taking a dive. Nobody has to take a dive for me. I can whip anybody in my weight. That includes you! Let him smear your map all over the place. So, now you wanna fight me? If you're looking for a fight, I'll give you one. Lou, take a poke at him. Me? Do you want him to think I'm a coward? I'll fight the two of ya. You couldn't even lick him. Yes, he could. Take a punch at him. I dare you... I double dare you! Stop coaxin' him! What a slugger.! I couldn't even see the punch. It was a right cross. No, it was an uppercut. What punch did you use? It was a half-Nelson, maybe a whole-Nelson. What's your name? Louie Francis. Louie the Looper! What a story! Where've you fought? Well, I-I-I... Tell 'em something. Okay, Tommy. I haven't had a fight since I went to school. Say something. I can remember the classes, but I can't remember the names. I licked Chucky Lemange in the fourth... and Chuck Grant in the sixth. And the teacher licked me in the eighth. The teacher? He means his trainer. Are you his manager? Sure. Would you consider a fight between your boy and Rocky Hanlon? Yes! What're you talkin' about? Rocky fights Malloy next week. That's right, I'm fightin' Malloy next week. Sure, Rocky's fightin' Malloy next week. After the story I'm writing, the Hanlon-Malloy waltz wouldn't draw flies. Attention, sports fans. My first exclusive. The Rocky Hanlon, Louie the Looper fight is set. And I say, watch this boy, Louie the Looper. His looks are deceiving, but there's no denying his punching ability. I was the first to recognizeJoe Louis. And in studying Louie the Looper's deceptive style... halfTony Galento, half Benny Leonard... I say, watch this boy. I'll call. What do ya got, Lou? Pair of jacks. And you, Bud? Queens up. No good. Three tens, you lose. Tommy, you are the luckiest guy. What's the idea of living in this high-class joint? For the benefit of our gambling friend, Morgan. Cut the cards. What's the matter, don't you trust me? How do you like that? I think somebody's cheating. You can say that again. What're you doin'? You gotta ante, Tommy. Okay, I'm dealin'. By the way, Tommy, what is your plan? Morgan will hear that you guys are a couple of free spenders... and figure you can be reached. He'll make a contact and we'll lead him on. Then, the night of the fight... Do I have to go in the ring with Rocky Hanlon? What're you worryin' about? I'll be there every minute. I'm dyin' to take a crack at Rocky. And I'll be in there just dyin'. I open. I'll stay. Cards? One. Give me two. One, two, three. I bet. I'll raise your bet. I'll raise you. I see that, and I raise you. That lets me out. I raise again. What're you doin'? I wanna make sure you're not peekin'. Oh, Miss Gray. Is Tommy here? Yes. Please come in. Tommy, Helen is here. Hello, Helen. Tommy. We oughta hang a bell around this boy's neck. Maybe he's inside changing his clothes... what clothes? I'll be right out, Helen. Lou... I guess you two want to be alone. Bud, not Helen and me, Helen and Tommy. Come on. Good-bye, Helen. Good... I still think somebody's cheating. Come on. Helen, you shouldn't have come here. You may have been followed, and the police could spoil my plans. I'm sorry, dear. I've been so worried. Last night there was fog. In fog or smoke, they can see you. I'll be careful. It isn't only that, Tommy. My uncle is worried about... About the effect of the drug on my mind? Tell him I never thought more clearly in my life. I've never felt so free. Invisibility gives me a sense of power, for good or for evil. Tommy, that... That feeling of power... It might be a symptom. Please come back to the laboratory. I can't. I must have time to clear myself. Another day, a week at the most. Then your uncle can try whatever he wants. All right, Tommy. But for my sake, please be careful. I will. Good-bye, boys. Good-bye, Miss Gray. Good-bye, Helen. If he starts acting strangely, call me. If he starts acting strangely, I won't be able to open up my mouth. We'll call you if anything happens. Thanks. Good-bye. Where're we goin'? To the Bubble Room. That's Morgan's hangout. The quicker you meet Morgan, the quicker we'll get action... and I crave action.! Who is it? Detective Roberts. You craved action, you're gonna get it. Get out of here! Just a minute, Detective Roberts. You stand there. He won't be able to see you. On your knees. On your knees! Atta boy. What can we do for you? Nothing, nothing at all. I just wanted to check up on what you've seen today. Are you still seeing men disappear into thin air? Or is it flying saucer day? This guy needs a pie-chiatrist. What I need is information, and I want it quick! I trailed Nelson's girl here. I know she didn't come to see you. Where's Nelson? You can believe me. I have not seen him since last night. That goes for me, too. You haven't seen him, huh? Okay, Nelson, get your hands up! What... What's this? My laundry. I'm sending it out. Your laundry! Don't forget to say hello to that nice man with the watch. A-tick-a-tock. Tommy... Tommy! The glass belongs here. Tommy, it's not polite to make noise when you eat. But I'm starved! I'll have the lamb chop luncheon. Yes, sir. I know what I want. Spaghetti. And a steak. What do you want? Spaghetti. And a steak. You said you knew what you wanted. Do you want spaghetti or steak? I'll have a spaghetti... and a steak. Yes, sir. I used to be a juggler. Many, many times... You care for anything else, sir? Yeah, yes. You can get me that swell-lookin' dish. Waiter, bring two dishes. I want to go halffies. That's Boots Marsden. I had a hunch she was with Morgan. But he doesn't even look like a fighter. He's fat and short. So, he won't have so far to fall when he takes a dive. Start workin', baby. Hey, she's coming this way. I must have caught her eye. May I join you? Sure, sure. Sit here, Miss Marsden. Move over. Move over. I hope you don't get the wrong impression of me... but I have two good reasons for wanting to meet you. The first one is, when I read what... Louie the Looper did to Rocky Hanlon... I said to myself, "There's a man!" That's the first time anybody ever said that about me. And the second reason? I'm a woman. That's even better than the first one. - How about a little drink? - No, thank you. Not here. I like privacy. There's nothing like wearing something comfortable... and turning the lights down low... and having a nice cool drink with a nice warm person. Yeah, but my place at the Carlton Towers is overcrowded. The Carlton Towers? Now, isn't that... a coincidence or fate or something? I live at the Towers, too. Hey, I live there, too. I hope you like your room. I'll be home all evening. Boots, Boots, Boots. Ah, shut up. You sound like Gunga Din. Morgan's made his first move. Tonight he'll make his second. Or I should say, she will. Boots, spaghetti. What a combination. What are you stuffing in your mouth? No. Bud. What's the matter? I don't want to do this. Now, listen. All we're trying to do is prove that Tommy was framed. You see this recording machine. All you have to do is start it. Then we'll get a record of what she says. And then you'll get a record of what I say. No, come here. All you have to do is lead her on. Come in. - Good evening. - Good night. What did you say good night for? I think she's getting ready to go to bed. So! Come in, Louie. Aw... You shouldn't have done that. I know, I'm just a little squirt. Flowers? For me? Yes, ma'am. How thoughtful. Put them over there on the table. Mm-mm. I just love flowers. They're like true friends. They see so much and hear so much... and yet they never talk. It sure would surprise people, if they did. Don't move. Stand where you are. I'm caught. I didn't mean anything. Don't talk. That light on your profile... it shows your iron will, your rugged individuality... your indomitable courage. Oh, darling. I always want to see you... the way you are now. It's your looks I'm worried about. Oh, not that you can't beat Rocky... but one lucky punch from him could ruin that profile. And then I'd lose all interest. You mean, you wouldn't like me if I wasn't pretty. Of course, I mean it. When it's so unnecessary. There's more money to be made losing a fight than winning one. All you have to do is agree to get knocked out. You can even name the round. First round? Mm-mm. Second round? Mm-mm. Third round? How many rounds can you last? Suppose you agree to three rounds. Then some nice friend will deposit a lot of money for you. How am I gonna know the nice man that's gonna put the money in. Maybe I can arrange a meeting. I'll phone, but remember... all of this is off the record. Louie.! Everything's set. We're to go to the Bubble Room. Oh, Louie. You won't regret this. Oh, Boots. Let's fight another round. What was that noise? That's off the record. Tommy, please listen. He must be made to realize the danger of his mental condition. Tommy, the doctor is afraid. Afraid? Afraid of what? That he'll never find the reagent? That I'll never be visible again? Well, tell him not to worry. I feel I feel much better this way. No one can touch me, not even the cops. That makes me a nemesis. It makes me a dictator. Tommy, please, Tommy. Take it easy. Hello, he's all right, Helen. I'll take care of him. He's just a little drunkey. Sure, sure, I'm drunk. Drunk with the power of invisibility. I am the ruler of an invisible empire. My loyal subjects I will reward. My enemies I will destroy. To be or not to be. Alas, poor Yorick. A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse. Put that down. Pour us a drink. You heard me. Pour a drink. Look, what's the matter with this one? That one? Yes, that one. I'm a two-fisted drinker. Put it in there. Well, well, Boots Marsden and Louie the Looper. Let's have a picture, huh? Help yourselves. Take a couple. Champ, how about a picture of you drinking champagne... out ofher slipper? Why not? We'll call the picture, uh, "Puss in the Boots. " Oh, Louie, what a sense of humor. Yeah. Ready, folks? Thanks. Ohhh! Trying to be smart? Don't fool with a buzz saw. This is Louie the Looper. Oh, okay, Louie. I'm sorry I spilled the champagne on you. Oh, that's nothing. Thank you. Compared to the blood that Rocky's gonna spill over you. If you wasn't here, I'd sock him. That's all right. I'm leaving now. I'll go with you. You stay here. I just made contact with the money man. Bud, I done everything you told me to do. Well, that's swell. Get off of me. I'm sorry, Tommy. Did you get the record? I did. And very fast, too. I broke a record. When I hired you I thought I was getting good detectives. We may not be good detectives... but we're very, very good friends. Friends! Excuse me. Did it ever occur to you that friendship is, at its best... a rather doubtful asset? I don't want friends. I shall have followers... worshippers, people who will obey me because they realize my greatness. To arms, to arms... Four score and six... Seven. Five. Five, three, two. Three, two. Would ya put your hand down. Tommy, if you don't pipe down, we'll all get into trouble. And another thing. You didn't give me a chance to tell you... that Boots is contacting the money man. Well, in that case, let's celebrate. Pour us a drink. No, Tommy. Do you realize every time you go into a saloon, the devil goes with ya? Well, if he does, he pays for his own drink. Excuse me. This time we'll do things my way. There's a lady present. The Looper will get his dough the night of the fight. Why don't you save your dough, boss? That guy just got in a lucky punch at the gym. I can take 'em. Yeah, sure, sure. Like you could take Nelson. Only Nelson took you, and O'Hara took my money. This time there'll be no slipups. But he thinks he's going to meet you. He is... if he tries to double-cross me. Thank you. Tommy, don't you think you've had enough? Tommy, you shouldn't drink other people's drinks. Oh, it's you, again. Wait a minute, just a minute. Don't get excited. This happens to be Louie the Looper. I know, he's a buzz saw. Here's where he's gonna lose a couple of teeth. Why didn't you duck? Duck? I didn't even see the punch coming. Come on. Let's get outta here. Save your punches for tomorrow night, Looper. You'll need 'em. Let's have a nightcap. Sure, Looper. Tommy, you've had enough drinks. Oh, is that so? Yeah, that's so. Excuse me, sir. Don't mention it. Oh, Tommy. I'm only telling you for your own good. Hey, Lou. He's down there. Tommy! What are you doing with my drink? I thought it was mine. Oh, yeah. I've heard that one before. Wait a minute. Bud, I'll handle this. I'll take care of this myself. Right, Tommy? Go ahead and start something. Double crosser. Hey. You hit my friend. Yeah, I hit him. Break it up, fellas. The boss don't like no rough stuff. You heard him. Lou, Lou. Come out of it, Lou. Here, see if this'll help. That didn't help him. Tommy, we've got to get him out of here. Here, I'll give you a hand. Come on. Get ahold of him. Come on. Atta boy, Tommy. What happened? Tommy got knocked out. That's funny. I thought it was me. Shut up. He got knocked out by the door. He was hit on the head. Where is he? I don't know. We got to get him out of here. Tommy, Tommy, tommy. Tommy. Where is he? Wait a minute. Pick him up. Come on. Pick him up. Atta boy. Pick him up. Get in that door. Hurry up. I don't think I'm gonna make it. You'll make it. Bring him over to me. Fold him up. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Fold 'em. Fold 'em. Get in there. Get inside. Now, tell it to me, again. I saw two men carrying no man. Imagine my trying to solve this riddle in a week. The harder I work, the more impossible it seems. Tommy! Hey, where am I? You know, I don't know. You're home with me, darling. Helen, baby. Oh, it's good to see you. It's good to... To have you here with us, Tommy. Us? Oh, hello, fellas. Gee, I sure poured one on last night, didn't I? You said it. A king-sized one. Boy, you were sure crazy... Uh, uh. What's the matter with you? I was gonna tell him that he was great. What'd you think I was gonna say? Crazy? He means about you trying to drink everybody's drinks. Yeah. I don't remember that. I drank so much I don't remember seeing anybody. We're even. We didn't even see you. But I do remember that deal with Boots Marsden. Now, what about the money? Well, we didn't have time to close the deal yet. Well, get in touch with her. Close the deal. Tell her you'll take the count any round she wants. When we get into the ring with Rocky we double-cross Morgan and knock his boy cold. Hey, this Morgan. Is he mean? He's a killer. He's mean. And if my hunch is right, he'll try to do what he did to O'Hara. Bump Bud off and put the blame on you, Lou. Fight postponed. Don't worry, Lou. As long as I'm in there with you, you're a cinch to win. I'm gonna make sure of it. Phew! What's that? Perfume. If I can't see you, at least I'm gonna smell you. I'll show you out. Doctor. Doctor! Yes, Tommy? I tried to sit up, but I'm paralyzed! I can't move. Take it easy, Tommy. I have you strapped down. It's just a precaution against a possible mental relapse. But the fight tonight. I'm sorry, Tommy, but I can't afford to take any chances. You can't take any chances? What about the chance I took? Helen said you were afraid. You're not afraid for me. You're afraid for yourself. Afraid of what the medical profession would do to you. You want to keep me chained like a mad dog to save your name... but you won't give me a chance to clear mine. And now, sports fans, my prediction for tonight's fight... between Rocky Hanlon and Louie the Looper. Louie the Looper was still in training late last night. Evidently, he ran out of sparring partners. Midnight found him completely exhausted. Perhaps this accounts for the wise money being switched... in favor of Hanlon late this afternoon. Both men lack defense, but are strong on offense. I predict this will be the most offensive fight of the year. Tommy! Oh, Tommy. Tommy! Relax! He said he'd be here. So, he'll be here. Yeah? Tommy. Tommy, Tommy. A black cat. Smoke. Give me that. What are you doing? What are you doing? Remember? Helen said you could see him in smoke or fog? Smoking will make you sick, then you won't be able to fight. I won't be able to fight. No. Mmm. Give me that cigar. Tommy. Tommy. Compliments of a friend. Oh. Well, do tell. "You can smell them or wear them. The fifth round will tell. " And you lay down in the fifth round. IfTommy don't get here, I'm gonna lay down right now. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, money. Real money, oh! Here's $1,000 for you, $1,000 for me, and one, two, three, $4,000 for him. $1,000 for you, $1,000 for me, and one, two, three, $4,000 for him. Wait a minute. Who's getting a bigger share? Him. Who's him? The income tax man. The... Tommy, Tommy. Tommy. You're on next. All set? All set. What's the odds? Five to two that Rocky smears him. Oh, oh-oh. Where you going? To get a cop. Somebody's gonna get murdered. Come here, stupid! People work a lifetime and never get $15,000. You're getting it for just lying down! Yeah. Lying down? That's got me worried. The big question is, will I be able to get up? Don't let me go in that ring without Tommy. Lou, ifTommy goes in the ring with you... he'll knock out Rocky and Morgan will bump you off! No. You'll get bumped off. I get the hot seat! One way or the other, I'm gonna get it in the end. Lou, here's what we've got to do. You go in the ring and lay down like Morgan wants. Everybody will be happy and we'll be into fifteen grand. We promised Tommy. Sure, sure. He promised to be here. Did he show up? Yeah. That's what I'm trying to tell you. I heard you telling him. I'm sorry, Tommy. I thought you ran out on us. Doc had me tied in his lab. I broke the straps. Are you guys gonna play on my side... or does Louie the Looper want to fight Rocky by himself? I'm on your side, Tommy. My heart's in the right place and I wanna keep it there. When we get in the ring, I'll do the pitching. As long as I don't do any catching. Semifinal's over. Let's go. Come on, champ. Follow me! Chest out, stomach in. I said, "stomach in"! Ladies and gentlemen, this is the main attraction... ten rounds of boxing. Introducing at 160 pounds... the leading contender for the middleweight crown... Rocky Hanlon! In this corner, that new sensation... Louie the Looper! Morgan. We still got a chance to change our minds. I'd rather argue with Tommy than try and outrun Morgan's bullets. I'm gonna lay down without sayin' my prayers. What are you guys whispering about? W-W-We were... We were what? We were saved by the bell. Your referee, Frankie Van. I want a good, clean fight. We ought to clean up. Every dollar the syndicate has... is riding on The Looper not going five rounds. When I say, "break," I want you to break clean. Now shake hands. Go to your corners and come out fighting at the bell. Feint at his chin, Lou. I'll do the rest. Sit down. Fight's on. No-no-no. Over there! Believe me, folks. There'll be an investigation. I'll swear there wasn't a blow struck. He never touched you. What are you doing? You told me to faint. Get up, get up! Eight... nine. Wait! That's no fair hitting there. If you're trying to throw this fight... I'll hold you up for ten rounds and let him cut you to ribbons! Now get up! Five... six. Do as I told you. Okay, Tommy, I'll be good. Tommy? Tommy he calls me. Hearing the birdies already, pal? Either these old eyes are failing or that boy hits like greased lightning. Go to your corner. One... two... Go to your corner. three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine. Left jab. Left jab. Left jab! Left jab! Right cross. Go to your corner. Did you deliver that money? Sure, boss. Tommy, let me finish him off, will ya? I can do it! Grr! Eight... nine. Oh! Ooo! Tommy, I didn't see what I was doing. Go to your corner. One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine. Tommy, will you get up? Open your eyes before he closes mine. Watch where you're punching. Are you kidding? Rocky, knock him out! The first round ends. I'm Frank to say that I don't get it. Get up there! Every punch Rocky gets shortens my life. What about my life? Let me handle this. Sure! Look at the condition of the guy in that other corner. What's the matter? Rocky, what's the matter? There's something phony about this. Get over to Rocky's corner. He hits from nowhere and hard! I can feel the guy's knuckles. It's like I'm fighting two guys! I keep hearing voices like someone's talking to him. Hearin' voices, eh? That's bad. I wonder what they're up to. Yeah. So do I. Rocky's been hit so hard, he's hearing voices. Every one ofThe Looper's punches has been short. I told you we couldn't trust those two guys. - Get me the torpedo. - Yes, boss. Okay, Tommy... here's where we ring down the curtain. One... two... three... Tommy? Tommy? Start punching. Four... five. Tommy? Tommy? One... two... three... what are you doing? I'm smellin'. It's poor English, but you sure do! Seven... - eight... nine. - Tommy? Hey, Bud, throw in the towel. It's too dirty. Besides, you're doing great. He hasn't laid a glove on you. Keep your eye on the referee. Somebody in there's cloutin' me. Six... seven... eight... What's wrong, boss? I'm not sure. Tell Milt to get into a cop's uniform. If those guys try to pull anything... we'll give 'em the same treatment we gave O'Hara. Louie the Looper has again been knocked for a loop. The bell saved him. He'll never come out for the next round. Atta, boy. You're doing great. You're doing swell. Stop stalling and give him the smelling salts. Uh-oh. He blew his top! Come on, Lou. Snap out of it! Tommy, you're here! Yeah. Good. You fight him. I'm tired. Get in and make it look good! Louie looks like he's out on his feet... but he's managing to avoid Rocky's punches. Rocky's swinging wild. One... two... three... four. Right cross. Left cross. Right cross. Right to the stomach. Upper cut. One... Milt all set? Yes. Let's go. Stay where you are. Seven... eight... nine... ten! I'll see you guys later. But, Tommy? Let's get out. No. The press boys wanna shoot my picture. And Morgan's boys wanna shoot me. Let's get outta here. Be sure nobody comes into that dressing room... except Louie and his manager. Same as last time. You sure look pretty in that cop's uniform. I hope my mother don't see me. Lou, Bud, where is he? He said he'd see us later. I found the reagent. We've got to get him. You better or you're gonna have two more patients. Doctor, let's the three of us have a fireside chat. About what? Oh, let's say arithmetic. Every time I add up you two with those two guys... the correct answer comes out Tommy Nelson. Really? Yeah, really. I don't know how it was done... but if you think that I think Louie the Looper knocked out Rocky Hanlon... you must think that I am a fool! You have the correct answer. That's what I say. Hey, wait a minute, Doc. Are we glad you're here! Morgan's a crook and so is his whole gang! But we're safe as long as you're here. Don't worry. Morgan won't be going in your dressing room. Where are you going? The Looper's dressing room. It's urgent. Nobody's allowed inside... but The Looper and his manager. Wait a minute. You wait a minute. Boy, I'm glad the cop was outside the door. I'm not scared anymore. A cop didn't save O'Hara from getting the works... or Tommy from going tojail. But they can't give me the hot seat 'til you're dead... which won't be long now. I've got one thing in my favor. Morgan don't know that we know how he framed Tommy Nelson. And he don't know that we're private detectives! He does now. Neither of you will get a chance to tell the cops anything. Let's talk this over. There's no... This is the payoff, Morgan. Who's talkin'? Tommy Nelson. I'm taking you to the cops. Not as long as this gun's in my hand. Get the gun, Lou. Confess that you framed me or I'll break your arm! Come on, Morgan, talk! Talk! Play smart and confess. Okay, Tommy, I got him covered. Tommy? Huh? Let him have it. Let him have it. Oh, no! Okay. All right, Tommy Nelson, or whatever you are... the minute you touch me, he gets it. Tommy! Ha-ha! You missed! Tommy, don't laugh. If you get killed, it'll be through me! Tommy? Only two shots left, Morgan. Ha-ha-ha. Try it again, Morgan! Ah-ha! Fellas, looks like I'm in the clear. We've cleaned up my case pretty well. Tommy? I think I can see you. I can, too! Tommy? Hold on to that phony. Tommy Nelson is innocent. These men killed O'Hara. Lock 'em up. Get these mugs outta here. Lou, where's Tommy? Tommy? We'll have to get him to the hospital. Get who to the hospital? Him. Him? Yeah, him. This transfusion should give him strength enough to stand the reagent. Anyway, we'll soon find out. The reagent, nurse. It's lucky you had the same type blood as Tommy. Why can't you be lucky sometime? Helen. Tommy. Hey, this is impossible. Lou, I can see Tommy! Quiet, Bud. You're in a hospital. You shouldn't make any noise. It's catching! My hand is gone! Doc, help! Doc! Don't worry. Some ofTommy's blood... may have backed up during the transfusion. I'm not worried. I'm gonna like being invisible. I'll be the greatest detective. I'll be able to find anybody. But you can't find yourself. That's what you think. Come on, Bud. Can't you do something? I don't think his invisibility will last. He couldn't have gotten that much serum. Come on, Bud! Come on, Bud. Get in! All right! It wasn't me. Please! Lou, wherever you are, let's go. Wait a minute. I got unfinished business. Aaah! Aaah! Uh-oh! Oh no! Doc? Oh, Doc! My feet are on wrong. That's just like you. You get everything backwards! Come on!
