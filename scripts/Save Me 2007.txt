You are oyndome? Quieres back? So that's a start. I saw that miracles happen here. Within time you'll have a miracle. You're going to start to see things differently. I promise that. I do not want to be this way. Here you are dear Mark. My father died ... with collapse of liver. Jesus did not save Alcoholism. So I think there was that stretch. So ... talking about ... these last three weeks have been fuckin '. Sorry. But ... Lester is cold, it makes me laugh. Randall .... is good for a joke silly on occasion. There was a time I was As far as the entry ... someone made me stop. You know how it feels, right? I think there is something here. In the past I would be .. in another county for Now, no doubt Hello friend, sorry. Sorry. What? Should be grateful for haberte have supported the first day. You mean when you faint. All right. Do not worry. Without resentimentos? All you do is try to help while hindering my ego. ZDE really think this works? Depends on what you mean it works. Or want to live. I had a lot of experience, I acted my way now I will try the others. Hi guys. And if I help those houses with birds? I look forward to that, Ted. Well. To work then. I keep saying that we should collect more than $ 10 for these things. Mark is for charity. Not for Telemarketing. What happened? Maybe we should charge more for yours. It was just an idea. I love as well as Maxine. Already we are almost a year, you think? Sounds good. Who would think that I would reach this point? But after five years I had to get something, sabes? I have a resolution of orientation. Perhaps not the best how to put this. I thought ... to ask her to marry me. But even I did not say anything. I need to earn more money first. She can not live here. And I'm not sure I live with her mother. Are the only options for now. I make it work somehow. To be perfectly honest, not included this in my final accounting report. This new type, Mark ... I had thought ... I know. I know it's okay, what happens, but ... dijistes that if you are not speaks about it is the risk of doing so. Now ... I trust my ill for inaction but that does not stop the thoughts. And I ... I feel guilty before Maxine. what I forgot included in the report And so ... That is why I'm by count to keep as far away as possible. With regard to drinking, I'm sober for five months since the last time, so ... I have a good control over that. Not. Things are getting better every day. Thank God. Yes, I think main problem is here. Randall! Randall? As we go? That's it. We can stop there. Disconnected before flooding here. Somebody close the water. I close. low? If. OK I told you that I'm afraid of heights? Come on Justin. Careful guys. Sorry, I did not want to frighten. How long you've been there? Few seconds. I thought that even were on the roof with Mark. No! No, we have found the leak. Is at the base of the skylight. Looks like you're having fun. Necesitas help with that? No. I'm fine. I'm almost done. What color is it? Why? These lines of the jacket. Say what color they are? I do not know is ... red. Gayle know, at that ... night he went with Mark ... That night? I gave it a cigarette, Since I left, but ... I think that was it was sick, I regret that. Scott Thanks for your honesty. Problem that would lead me the van to go visit my father? You go alone? If. Ted holds the key. Hey, buddy! Nice to see you. It's also good to see Hector. Que pasa? I have a small leak in the roof of the Genesis, I need some things to repair the skylight. Let's look. I saw you talking with your father. Me If ... He is ... hard on your way. It's good to see it though. What gave to find Jesus? Amen to that. If so never worked with me. Or if it did, it was a feeling that ended so quickly that neither I remember. I remember my mother not near I think that when she died, my father as he stood ... ceased to live. Except through me. So when my father discovered that I was gay acted as if I ... he died too. Or as if the person he knew was dead. So I looked people like me I mean, I met gay people, but the bars and parties ... I felt ... as if the person I should be. Was when I started thinking maybe my father is right. Perhaps what I thought his sentence was was a deep love. Being attracted by men with men or go that ... that ... need not be part of who I am because it is part the image of God. I think my father ... is proud of me now. Chocolate or strawberry? Strawberry! And if you had told me chocolate? I like to drink strawberry. You sleep better? Yes Lester finally stopped snoring. How long were you in that hospital? In that occasion? Prior to this. Three months. What did you do? It is not in the report of ex-gay? Mark! We take seriously what we do. I tried to commit suicide. How? with a knife. It was my father, which follows from that? must have felt an immense pain. I did not feel anything, was drugged at the time. I wanted to say what you did. Well, he died for me. Ironically. Think it was because of what you did? That is what my mother and brother would like to believe. My father had entered on that path long before the gay factor arose. What the Bible says about the repairs of shit? Mark ... That language. Sorry. I had a son. Did you have? Died. After eight years. How? An overdose. How old was he? Seventeen. Was gay. Then he committed suicide? I do not think I wanted. But he got there lifestyle and drugs. I was very young. So ... Why not change? Did everything? Mark I do not change people. Tries to show how closer to Jesus Christ. And let them make their own way. Unless you already know the path. You know how it is when people who were near death? Speak to walk towards the light? Well ... I think we do the same in life. But we walked towards the Lord. And sometimes that light is so bright ... cegante is ... but if we have faith ... and continue to lead toward it, taking a step every time ... then we begin to see that the light of the Lord .. is within us. And when we do ... it overflows ... and illuminates our path not to lose its way. Never again. Skies! And I seem sensible and decent. You are! Well ... grateful. That was nice. Who would have said that Mark were on our team. We are all on the same computer. It is not why we're here? Today was fun. If. Lester seems to be fine. Slowly. Just because I do not understand seem to encourage Mark and Scott. What? Do not trust him? With whom? Scott. Do not be ridiculous! Not why is it that we fight here? A healthy friendship, nothing sexual men? Mean, they were playing baseball for the love of God! If! Gayle listens. You're right to be worried. You know that Mark is ... clever. It is a flawed and invalid are ready. But perhaps we should give him a chance. Contrary to this, there is no turning back. Back to what? He reminds you to Ryan. Please! Not it is happening here. He just needs to be protected. We need everyone. Ryan was not your son. Please do not use it well. Sorry. It is not fair. Hey, maybe we should be leaving, moment let them find their own way. You awake? If. With how many men had sex? More than ten? If. Ever been in love? Once. Of a man? If. A long time ago. He knew? knew. Gayle said that I I am blessed because I never I fell on my drive homosexual weakness. I do not know how to do it differently. You ... but the Bible says that if you ... commit a sin of thought is the same as comets in reality. Think is true? Not, perhaps. You think? I hope so. Good night. Goodnight Lester. Sinner. Ladies and Gentlemen, The lull is ... done! So many think they will come? I think we should wait a few twenty-five. Perhaps more we must spread the word. Now ... What to bring? Five? Six! Crap! Well, this was removed GammonEmpire in March of last Obviously, you should Maxine invite Hollister. She carried out with Bill for a year. That's wonderful! This is a. .. Bethany Mallow? Heaven ... she ... a little fatter, no? Not that is not adorable. They are all adorable. I only hope that are free on Saturday night. Well, I can ... give a special word for six. Grateful pastor. I can not say how much I appreciate it. is an important job. Praise God. Pastor ... I am not sure if Ted have spoken to lately But the house needed repairs. And the guys are not can do everything alone. Well ... We have some free beds, y. .. had no idea that the church could help in the coming months Gayle ... Who we are happy to support this dance. But we are trying our aguante sister church in its foundations. You know I always support Genesis the way we can. Yes, we supported him and very grateful. I was just thinking ... We talked again after the dance. It would be wonderful. Grateful pastor. If it is so .. Wait. Yes? Who? The Lord is my shepherd, I would not be lost. He made me lie in green fields, led me to calm water. He restored my soul, guided me through the paths of justice for the glory of his name. Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, no fear no evil because He is with me, your rod and your staff comfort me. If a man lies with another man, as if sleep with a woman, both have committed an abomination ... Father. should be sentenced to death; their blood shall be upon them. Father! I ... I love you so much dad! Why did this Scotty? No! Your heart will have been disappointed. Going to hell! And I do not ... I will see you again. Jesus Please take the brother Henry Cooper, accept the kingdom of your father. Why? Father, no ... Scott's father has just died. How is Scott? Let? Ted says he is okay? You never cry for you, right? By that hypocritical? Are you kidding? We should not blame others Mark. The fault lies with us. Nothing worthy of salvation is simple. We can pray? When you come back? an hour ago or so. Ted gave me a ride. Sorry. He hated me. I knew what happened. Deus ... Leviticus ... I was probably still cheating, thinking he was OK with me now. I never thought it would be the last I thing he would say. Scott, he could be delirious with drugs, not create. Cree in me. You know, should not be imported. But I care! I am here because of him. What do you mean? I came here two days after ... The doctor told me that he was dying. Was going to do right. Y. .. Was true for some time. knew so well. Know. Yet known. No. Lately I have thought that I am not here for him. That's good. You are here for you. That was not what I said. I think it's because I love you. Much. Me too. Can I ask you a cigarette? If. Forgive me. It's all good. We were going to smoke. A smoking with you. See you there. Just do not understand the reasons for which you want to go Lester. I thought you liked being here. You have much to give. For all of us. and you know that this process takes time. When I have questions ... I know that is the Lord ... testing my faith. Remember what your father was going on when you brought? As was the broken heart? We do not want to spend our problems for your father, right? Not when we can we deal with them the same here. Cute child. Step S11 We are determined not to continue living in fear of the world, believe that the victory of God's glory dump all those who are against us in our favor. Bringing the benefits of sorrows order and disorder. Step 12s We are determined to have mature relationships with men and women learning the meaning a partnership between equals. not seeking domination over others or slavish dependence on them. Grateful. I had hoped that we could talk about last night. What are we listening? I know. You can give me a hint? There is a new mother in there. He had hopes of talking about what happened in last night. You are disculpandote by ... you've taken advantage of me? If. A species. Do not use. Want to forget, forget. Not that I'm saying. I just ... Afraid of love then? If Gayle discovers what she ... What I am trying to say is ... I know what you're trying to say is you are better here and does not want anyone to ruin everything. I see them together consistently. We must do something. Endure just as it is. We have to keep on track! Because always judge Scott so harshly? The Andrews will be here any moment. You involved with since the day he arrived. Ted ... sometimes a boy makes all the right things. but inside, we know that he is not accepting Christ into your heart. We saw that before. So we have to work harder. He is a risk to others Kids who can save. Mark, you mean. Mr. Andrews is about love discipline and the sacred work of God here and around the world. Johnny, you had opportunity to meet the residents? Any. Like it? They were friendly? If. Think you will like it here? He is very shy. And this is the first time to be away from home. I think you'll like this, wanted, ZnO? Sr.. Taylor, I think that you and your husband is created a miraculous thing, but ... This is only the first premises visited, I want more time to ... decide, if you do not mind. I understand. George, there is nothing wrong with this place. Almost all the same I think? Well ... think that ... wait to see the others. The work we do here is excellent. No control programming or brain washed. Only the love of Christ. Sorry. My wife did not want to say that. We are all warriors for Jesus, I wish you luck in your search. Good luck. hate these dances. I just ... I do not understand because we can not learn to socialize ourselves. And I do not like girls. I like you, enough, just ... these rituals forced ... "Do this now" "undoubtedly" "around the room here we go." Are not very disappointed if you see me dance. This is what I mean. Not that I do not know dance. I know. Do not look in that direction can dance, not only with women. Not with these women. I hate when I look well. Very tough. Do not put the cards on the table. Too ... Little contact with their true emotions. Try to tricks to survive. and beaten regularly, to fifteen years. To see what would work. Mark Now that the roof is repaired should spend more time with others. Others? Well, I see you're fine with Scott, but ... I think Lester particular will like to talk to you soon. Clear. He admires you. I said yes. Muy bien! All ready for fun? Thank you. Pastor, I knew that we have sold six houses birds? That's wonderful for us and for the birds. Well, you know what they say: If they are built. You did a good job. And at the funeral. I am happy for that. Your father would like. A glass for friends. For me? Scott told me you did amazing things with the business. Probably not say anything because of his father. There are not many secrets. Want to dance? Yeah, right. This music is beautiful. We have to dance. No. Come on! We have the stage and everything. This is more ao meu gosto. Come on Daddy-Dancer. Come on! Okay, okay. It is shameful. The pastor is here. Gayle! Do not make a scene, not today. Do not do that. While the pastor is looking defendant should stop with that now. Stop what? You know what I'm talking about. I said do not do this. I do everything I need. I'm tired of your games. I thought it significbamos something for you. That what we were getting meant something. It is shameful what they are doing. So stop. Because you never like? Do not be ridiculous. No! Why? Scott is neither the time or place for that. Ted, do not tell me So to me, tell her. Scott! I wanted though I would like Gayle, but I think I does seem ridiculous to you. Let's relax. We are all a bit tense here. You encouraged this behavior. Gonna make a scene. Like when I I stay well, not like you? Gayle! What is it? is because I am not breathing crying on your shoulder? Or because I do not agree with your child? You do not have that right! You are a wolf in sheep's clothing and I I knew since I entered this house. You never accept Jesus into your heart. You were faking it all this time. And now you see someone which seeks to find its way you take advantage of their weakness. Sorry, you're asking me to go? I'm asking you. to stop! How is that again? Hector gave me a ride, he ... aAnne was to bring home y. .. I went back to ... to catch. Watch ... calm, okay? You can spend the night. Tomorrow we can talk about ... No! A shit! I do not think the time it wasted my life! In my ... I ... wasted in this place! You can make this work. This is how it works. Please do not go! I have no choice. Can not feel it tomorrow, okay? It's not what I mean. I know you're accustomed to having what you want Mark. But you can not have both. That is not fair! OK, I finally feel good to me. This place is good, these people are good! I feel God through me. This thing happened among us, not their plan. You sure about that? You can leave me at that door. Good luck Mark. Gayle is afraid to ride Scott. That was why she acted that way. She did what she had to do. You love him? What? No? You are in love with him? Go back to sleep. Gayle and I saw this before, but ... this was the worst. She manages to be ... which is the word? Ferocious! That was what I saw in it know before. It was at a retreat. At that time took six months sober. She offered me work. I needed the job, I accepted. Were known. But Ryan was his weak point. She thought the being gay was the problem. When correcting this, the boy corrected. The Genesis did better. I am not convinced we are the only way. But ... I know that helped. That I know. Scott left. It was what I heard in the road at midnight. The others know? I think so. Is there anything else? Lydia is doing a small brunch, I will help her. That would be gentle. Mark? Hello. I know it hurts. But it would be. He is going to solve it! And let us not fall into temptation; But deliver us from evil because yours is the kingdom. The power and glory, For all eternity. Amen! Well ... think at this time all know that Scott left us. Someone wants to talk about that? I love! Nobody seems to want more. I saw a friend who was Good, now Look at him. There are roads that lead to error and lead to different ends. What does that mean? It is assumed that will make us feel better? Lester ... No! I liked the way that things were taking. Is not a sin, like your love, love is a wonderful experience and should be shared verdad? It was not what we teach? I understand how you feel Lester. But living through someone that is not God is the correct way for a lifetime of sadness. But they ... Lester! She is right. You spent your shirts for the mass? Not yet. I have to go through. Do not forget, Mark tomorrow to read. I forgot. We have the room to the night. Well ... is at home. Maybe we can repeat this one of those days. I think not. Look, is not about you. Just ... You have someone at home. It is a little more complicated than that. I heard that you are quarentones. Until then have plenty of time for that ... do not worry. Reading is the First Epistle to the Corinthians. Though I speak the languages of men and of angels, and do not have love, it sounds like metal, or like the bell that tine. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I felt like a child, I thought like a child; But when I became a man, I ended up with things as a child. Because now we see in the mirror, an enigma, but then face ... face to face; Now I know in part, but eventually met as also I am known. And now, remains the faith hope and love these three; but the greatest of these is love. Thank you. Creis you that she thinks the same? She seemed proud, are not? Maxine looks at me many times that way. I will say one thing I know here seems strange coming from me, but I will say the same. I believe that Jesus made this all possible. I mean, I know Gayle has more credence in that, but I think I really I caught the ball and tag, right? Yes, it's true. oventa days sober today. Praised be the Lord. Praised be the Lord. Crap! Relief! Relief! Call 112! Help me! Call 112 and request an ambulance! Ya! Lester was! I called 112. Jesus Christ! How long it takes so? Not! Lester get hear me? Okay? Dios mio! Do something, please. Do not let die. Mark! Mark! For! Reach! Reach. It's all good. All right. So What Happens Now? You will return? Well, I have no where to go next. I have to shuffle things. Why did this? Not. Many reasons, but ... when I saw them together ... and you looked so happy, only wanted to see two men taking it. Able to share that. I know that is not correct say, but ... I think not consegira live differently. Excuse me. Qeu are you going to do with this place? Scotty does not know wanted to be proud. Gave me a chance when all the world thought I was not observant. You know that he was proud of you too, right? If. How goes it? The what? This. Well ... If you have not noticed, I do not think a Cooper or a son. That is changing. If you want yours. You serious? If. Do not know what to say. Talk to Anne. Gonna leave the city or similar? Let's say ... there are things greater than ourselves. Jude phoned me. I'm surprised I did not 've counted what happened with Lester. Gayle blame me because of him too? She was disturbed. Mean stubborn. He came here to correct me? No. I came here to see you. To learn how you are. But it seems you are very good. Lester returned. If. Yes, I know. Mark? Yes? It is better to come. I'm going now. I will go. I will try to Arizona some time, perhaps Los Angeles. Really? Vines to dismiss me. Okay. And there ... something important I want to know Gayle. I'm not shattered. I do not know because some time expected to change. If a man lies with another as if man slept with a woman both have committed an abomination and both should be sentenced to death. For! There are four more than before, but this is the case, any person who cursed her father or mother should be sentenced to death! This is not a game Scott. God is not a game! Ever seen those words? Gayle, Jesus never said nothing about homosexuality. Not negotiated the path of salvation. Goodbye Scott. ever looked at yourself? I mean, not kids but look, with no middle. Why are you doing this? That gives you the right to accuse me of anything? Gayle, is not as strong as thought. And if you're not really giving, unable to cope with the confusion. Things have to be clean and clear for you, but Life is not so. I do not know what it is. Bringing a child. But I know what it is to have parents so full of hate dying cursing instead of love. Is this what you really think? sincerely believe you can convince me? You get to discuss with me and change my mind on what should be correct? I know that love is real. I know that love is good. Mark, let's go. Mark? Gayle when I was with Lester I felt I was clinging love. I felt the love he had. I felt every time he came. I found something here. But is no longer here. That is not true. Nothing but love for you here. In my heart, all our hearts, I noticed that. In your fault remember as you were sick? They do not want it happen again, verdad? Think about it as far as you can. Do not miss the course, you have light. Remember what we said that day in the car? When we left the two? Remember what feel? I was who you are. I know how to stay safe. Gayle? Ted is out of this. You have to let go. He is not Ryan. Ryan died. This is the sin I can not let these small guys. You can not save Gayle. He has to do for himself let it go. Let this happen? You look and let this happen! Maybe you've done. It's all good. It's all good. Forget the past. Come on. I need some staff time to say goodbye. If. The answer is believing there are consequences in this world. And the judge of our actions, however much we like to believe that we, is God. Genesis is an expression of my faith. The work of my life. Attempts to justify myself to my son through my work there. Ryan ... Ryan came to me when I was 16 and said: I was gay, said she did not want to change, she did not want to live according to the Lord, and I told him to leave my house, because they would not accept it under my roof. And five months after he died. The day I told him to go was the last time I saw my son. I know I never I will have more back. If I can help a child ... out of their misery, I will everything in my power to achieve that. Ryan showed me only their weaknesses. I knew there was a child full of love in one package. And despite being able to see it. Through trial and disgust, what I would have loved as Christ loved. It could have been another. Could have stayed home. And over time could have worked in his salvation. But now ... I have the opportunity to save others. And myself. How I want to pass the check? I felt invisible until ... Mark? May the Lord be with you. He is. He is! Welcome. Welcome back John. Welcome back to Genesis. Google translate
