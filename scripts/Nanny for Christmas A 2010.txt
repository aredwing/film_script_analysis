On the business front, it's the last week before Christmas and retailers are reporting a 50% increase over sales figures from last year- a sign that the economy is rebound- Mom, I can't find my pink hair-clip! I can't find my other shoe. It's missing! - Where are my hair-clips? - What did you do with it yesterday when you got home from school? You're always losing the pink ones so wear the blue ones. I wore the blue ones last week. So wear the fuzzy ones. - What fuzzy ones? - The fuzzy pink ones. - Those are uncool. - I don't know. Then just wear your hair down. It looks very pretty. Just brush it. Put it behind your ears. I know you're just saying that. I'll wear a headband! Mom, where's my other shoe? Oh wow. You two better not be on the computer. You don't want to be late the last day before winter break. Where's the phone? Hello? Oh hi, honey. The kids? Oh, perfect angels as always. - Girl: Mom! - Mother's on the phone with Daddy! So... did you have a chance to think about what we talked about? Getting a nanny. Well, it's just really tough without you here, Carl. And I could use the help, you know? Speaking of which, how are things in the New York office? Ally Leeds. Hi, Mr. Halligan. The Danny Donner Chocolates pitch? Don't worry- it's all under control. Did you hear? Danny Donner is looking for a new ad agency. Mm-hmm. Yeah, he wants to take his image in a new direction. Yes, I spent all night going over the statistics and I am confident that Mr. Donner is going to love what we have to offer him. Of course. I've got Justin's team working on new ideas right now. You know, Carl, if we could get this account, we could totally turn things around. Hold on. Breakfast! He would be a fool not to sign with Halligan Ad Consultants. Okay. No, I've got everything handled. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. Really? So I guess you're not coming home for Christmas then? Mom, Jonas flushed my hair-clips down the toilet! It wasn't her hair-clips, it was her hairbrush. - What? - Your action figures are going down! Um, yeah... No, of course I understand, Carl. I do. I, um, just... call me when you think about it, okay? Hold on. Which toilet? Jackie, Jonas, have you seen my handbag? Yeah, love you too. Okay, you ready? - Mm-hmm. - Where's your backpack? Come on. Ahem. Talk to me. Mr. Donner, we realize that you're unhappy with your current advertising agency. And we appreciate the fact that you're taking time off to come here. We feel confident Halligan Ad Consultants will be the best fit for your company. Okay, let's go. All right, allow me to introduce my associate, Ally Leeds. Ally, take it away, please. When you sign with Halligan Ad Consultants, you're not just signing with an ad agency; you're signing with a specialized team- a team formed around your product. That means a team of high-level executives that are working 24/7, coming up with creative ideas with one purpose in mind: to boost the sales of the single best brand of chocolates on the marketplace today. Because at Danny Donner Chocolates, you're not just selling chocolate; you're selling life. Your birthday... the birth of your first child... ...your parents' 50th anniversary... and of course... your wedding. My wedding? My wedding? My wedding?! Is there something wrong with weddings? Mr. Donner, I wonder if we just- Mr. Halligan, I appreciate your hospitality, but I will be taking my business elsewhere. - Mr. Donner, please- - My wedding! We don't have to do weddings. We'll forget the weddings. My fingers are in my ears now. I can't hear anything. He probably just needs a little time to think about it. Can we talk? Ally: How was I supposed to know he got left at the altar? Woman: Didn't you read the headlines? "Donner bride bolts. " Jeez, did you not even Wikipedia him? I mean, this is the thanks I get. Ally: Maybe I should have done more homework, or gone with a Christmas theme like everyone else. You're a creative genius. I'm sure you'll get another job. In this economy? They're not even giving unpaid internships. I don't think you understand the severity of my situation. Oh, I do. It means I'm not getting a Christmas present from you. - And I already got yours. - You did? A day at the spa. If I don't get another job soon, I am not gonna be able to afford to pay my mortgage and the bank's gonna foreclose on me and I'm gonna have to move back in with my parents in Ohio. Do you have any idea how cold it is in Ohio right now? I know. I wish there was something I could do to help you. I mean, I'd hire you myself but our promotional contracts are a little slow right now. Wait. Actually maybe there is something. Doesn't your cousin work for Samantha Ryland- does her taxes or something? Oh no, I- I don't think that's a good idea. I'm sure you could get me an interview. I've heard she's really demanding. Well, she's one of the best execs in the ad game. Surely she'd recognize my talents. But what if it didn't work out? My cousin would kill me. I'm desperate, Tina. Foreclosure, Ohio- remember? Look, just an interview- that's all I ask. I'll take care of the rest. Okay. Okay, I'll call him after I get off. You're the best. Now cheer up. Have a Danny Donner chocolate candy cane. Traitor. All message playback. Hello, this is Mr. Thompson from United Collections calling. This is my third attempt to notify you of an outstanding balance due. Please return my call immediately at 800-5- - Tina: Hello, Ally? - Please tell me you have good news. Tony talked to Samantha and she wants to meet you. Thank you, thank you! Candy cane? Danny Donner Chocolates. So the interview is scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM - at the Ryland Agency. - That- that's perfect. - What's the position? - He didn't say. All he said is she's desperate to fill it as soon as possible. Thank you so much. You are a lifesaver. It's all up to you now. Good luck. Oh, candy cane? Danny Donner Chocolates. Don't forget to buy 'em. Hi. Ally Leeds. I have a 9:00 with Samantha Ryland. Yeah. Have a seat right over there and she'll be right with you. Can I get you anything? A raspberry scone? No, thank you. I'm allergic to raspberries. Okay. - Oh oh. - Oh my- I'm so sorry. It's okay. You've got a little something on- I have insurance if you want to exchange information. You've got- you've got a little something on your chin. Uh, let me. Justin, Dolan's waiting for you in the conference room. I'll be right there. - Good? - Yeah. I gotta go. Okay, these are your messages. And that's Ally Leeds. - Your 9:00. - Oh. Mm, 10 minutes early. Promptness is a virtue today. - How do you do? Samantha Ryland. - Ally Leeds. Perfect. Follow me. Hold my calls... unless it's Donner. I just wanted to say what an incredible honor it is to finally meet you. I mean, what you did with the Fiora Perfume line was genius. Yeah, it smelled like wet dog. Well, Edwin Land used to say that marketing is what you do when your product's no good. Mmm, you did your homework. Have a seat. Is that the original Pumpkin Patch Doll? Sure is. Put the Ryland Agency on the map. But that was a long time ago, when men were men and ads were ads. Let's talk- What's your name? Ally- Ally Leeds. Let me give you a copy of my resume. Uh, keep it. References are much more important in this line of work. Tony vouched for you. That's all I care about. So how do you feel about personal fitness? I jog three miles a day. And Shakespeare? Well, actually I played the Courtezan in a college production of "A Comedy of Errors. " I believe in incorporating a little dramatic flair- What about homework? I'm a big believer of always being prepared. Terrific. Can you be available at a moment's notice? I'm very dedicated. Also I'm looking for a disciplinarian. I ran my division for two weeks when Johnson went on vacation. Hmm. Good. I believe in being honest so I'm gonna be straight with you. My husband has been back East for the last two months opening our New York office. Meanwhile I am here desperately trying to balance being a mother, being a father, and running an entire advertising agency. I have come to the inevitable conclusion that I need help. Excuse me. Yes? Woman: Mr. Donner's on line 1. Oh, uh, thank you. Excuse me. - Hello, Mr. Donner. - Susan. - Well, it's Samantha, actually. - Susan, two weeks ago I was hunting buffalo in the Adirondacks and my annual sales report came through on my phone. In the 25 years since I started this company from nothing, I have never posted a single financial loss- not one- until now. - So you know what I did, Susan? - No, sir. I tossed my shotgun to the ground. I immediately shut down my facility and I started flipping through my phone book for someone to hold responsible. And you know who I came up with, Susan? Uh, your former advertising firm? Bingo! I hear they have product-placement people handing out samples at ice-skating rinks. Ice-skating rinks, Susan! - Oh. - I want something new. I want something bold. And I hear you people are doing some pretty amazing stuff, Susan. Thank you, sir. Actually it's- it's Samantha. And after my meeting with those boneheads over there at Halligan, I can use a little bit of amazement, Susan, believe you me. I want a fresh start going into the new year, Susan. So I want to make a decision by Christmas Eve. Valentine's Day is rapidly approaching and it's the biggest day of the year for a chocolatier. So there's not a moment to lose. You understand, Susan? - Of course. - Set it up. Uh, thank you, sir. The Ryland Agency is very- Sir? Yeah, call the team. Assemble an emergency strategy meeting, five minutes. Thank you. Look, I'm really sorry to cut this short, but this is a really big opportunity for us. Believe me, I understand. This is what I'm offering per week. Monday to Friday, 8:00 to 6:00, maybe as late as 7:00 sometimes, weekends- overtime, of course. - Dollars? - What do you say? When can I start? Perfect. I know you'll make a great nanny. Ally: A nanny? Tina: Ally, I swear I had no idea. Tina, I'm an ad executive. Look at the bright side: it's top dollar and it'll get you through the holidays. I don't know about this. I don't know the first thing about nannying. What's there to know? It's like babysitting, only you get paid a lot more. I don't know about this. Beggars can't be choosers. And who knows? Maybe a real spot will open up. I don't know. # It's Christmas time of year # # Everybody swing # # Well, it's Christmas time of year again # # And there's ribbons on the tree # # 'Cause everybody here loves Christmas # # Here we go, let it snow, ho ho ho! # # Whoo # # Well, it's Christmas time of year # # Everybody swing # # Yeah, it's Christmas time of year again # # Hang the trimmings on the tree # # Does everybody here love Christmas? # - # Yeah # - # Here we go, let it snow # # Ho ho ho # # Here we go, here we go, ho ho ho # # Here we go, here we go, ho ho ho # # Here we go, here we go, ho ho ho. # Miss Leeds. Please come in. Children? Ah. Come meet your new nanny. This is Miss Leeds. - Pleased to meet you. - You must be Jackie. - Mm-hmm. - You're very pretty. - Why thank you, Miss Leeds. - You can call me Ally. - And this is Jonas. - Very nice to meet you, Miss Leeds. Oh, that's quite the grip you've got there, Jonas. Mother says a man's handshake should be as firm as his character. All right. Well, I'd love to stay and show you around, but I've got a meeting. Here is a schedule of the children's errands, activities, et cetera. Please don't deviate from the regimen. - Of course. - Happy to have you onboard. Oh, uh, Miss Leeds? I play by the rules. I expect the same from you. As long as you play by the rules, we should be just fine. The rules- got it. Good. Children, come give me a kiss. Uh, don't spread germs. Air kiss. Good luck. Aren't you a little old to be a babysitter? I'm a nanny. There's a difference. - What's the difference? - Money. Loosen up, guys. We're gonna have some fun. You're not a real nanny, are you? Don't be silly. Of course I'm a nanny. Okay, so what's next on the agenda? A little game of freeze tag, maybe? - What's freeze tag? - You're kidding. You've never played freeze tag before? Never. Okay, moving right along. Yoga, Shakespeare... flax shake for breakfast? Okay. Mother sprinkles protein powder on top. - It's in the back room. - Okay. Here she comes. Okay, I see how it's gonna be. Here you go. You guys actually eat this stuff? Mother says the cornerstone to any successful day is a nutritious breakfast. How about something with, you know, a little flavor? Maybe a little color. How about pancakes? Oh no, Mother forbids those these days. But it wasn't always like that. When we were younger, she used to make them every Sunday. Dad too. Will your father be coming home for Christmas? He's a busy man. I'm sure he's not too busy for his family. We used to spend every Christmas together when I was little. - Yeah? - We'd throw a big party in the house and everyone in the neighborhood would come. I wish we could do it again. Jackie: I asked, but Mother said no. Ally: "Recite Shakespeare. " Mother says a person who can master the rhythm of the iambic pentameter can master the English language. You guys actually do this stuff? - Every day. - Is it fun? Mother says fun is something we can have after we retire. In that case, you've got another 50 years or so. You're up. "From fairest creatures we desire increase, That thereby beauty's rose might never die, But as the riper should by time decease, His tender heir might bear his memory... " How much longer? We have to cycle through about How long is that gonna take? Mmm, not long. About an hour, you know, give or take. I graduated summa cum laude from one of the top schools in the country. Now I'm nothing more than a glorified babysitter. I don't know how much more of this I can take. Do I need to remind you that that starter home you worked all those years for could be taken away at a moment's notice if you don't pay your mortgage? You don't understand. These kids, they're- ugh! They're so repressed. Great. That's your specialty. Unrepress them. Get them to open up. And remember you're rubbing elbows with one of the biggest names in the ad industry. You're right. Besides, a little yoga might do you good. Take the edge off. I like the edge on. # Now the ground is white... # "Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, do you have the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?" - Hold on. - Was my pentameter off? - This is a play, right? - Yes. Then you should be playing it. Where are the set pieces and the props? What do you mean? - Okay, are you guys ready? - Yeah. We're gonna start with the classic tale of mistaken identity. - Cool. - Follow me. Okay, we're gonna start with when Dromio Syracuse mistakes his boss for his boss's twin brother. Jackie, it's your job to get this gold coin to Jonas. - That sounds easy. - Well, there's a catch. I'm gonna try to stop you. I'm the Courtezan. You have to start from down there. Jonas, you stay up here. Okay, here are your swords. Jackie, follow me. - You ready? - Yeah. Action! "Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, do you have the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?" "What gold is this? What Adam does thou mean?" "Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's skin that was killed for the Prodigal lamb; he that came behind you like an evil angel, and forbid your liberty. " "I understand thee not. " "No? Why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike. " - Here comes the Courtezan! - Ahh! Give me the gold coin. "Well met, well met, Master Antipholus. I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now: Do you have the chain you promised me to-day?" You've met your match, Courtezan! Now that's what I call Shakespeare. - I think that was so fun. - That was awesome. Ally: Shakespeare, check. Hmm, yoga's next. I have a better idea. What are we doing? Our schedule says it's time for yoga. Are you telling me you'd rather be doing yoga on a day like this? Come on, follow me. I don't know if Mother would approve. You guys ready? Follow me. Let's do it again. - Okay. - Okay, ready? First one down to the bottom wins. Whoo! Okay, how about we sing a song? - "Jingle Bells"? - Yeah. # Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way # - # Oh, what fun- # - # Oh, what fun it is to ride on a... # May I talk to you for a minute? Children, go up. Wash your hands. Ally: So I didn't exactly have a lot of time to clean up after Shakespeare today. Uh, Miss Leeds? I do not understand. I specifically asked you to follow the rules. I did. Shakespeare- that was on the list. It said nothing about destroying my house in the process. Jackie: I'm sorry, Mom. That was my idea. - It won't happen again. - Never again. I guess we got a little carried away. That's an understatement. Yes? Okay. I've got to go back to the office for a few hours. I need you to stay here. Of course. And children, this house better be spotless when I get back here. - Thanks for covering for me. - It's okay. - It was fun. - Lots of fun. Okay, guys, it's story time. And I've got a good one for you. It's perfect for Christmas. But I have to warn you, it's a little scary. I'm sure we can handle it. I mean, we're all adults here, except for Jonas. You're not an adult; you just try and act like one. Have you ever heard of the legend of the Christmas ghost? Christmas ghost? No. The Christmas ghost comes around once a year to scare all the naughty children that didn't listen to their parents or their nannies. Children were so afraid of him that they made a chant to keep the Christmas ghost away. And it went like this: "He comes around on Christmas night With eerie sounds that start to fright. The tall thin man with skin of scales Leads to children's screams and wails, Makes it hard for you to swallow. His eyes are black and cheeks are hollow. Boo! But if you've been nice, no need to fear. Just spread goodwill, some love and cheer. " That wasn't scary. That was silly. I would be careful what you say if I were you. Christmas is only two weeks away and the Christmas ghost might pay you a visit. I think parents just made that up to make their children be good. Are you sure about that? Mwah ha ha ha ha ha! What are you doing, Jonas? I'm making a list for Santa. I wouldn't get your hopes up. What if Miss Leeds is right? I'm gonna ask Santa if he could bring Dad home for Christmas. What does Miss Leeds know? She's just a nanny. - I like Miss Leeds. - I like her too. She reminds me a little bit of how Mother used to be. Maybe she'll take us to see Santa. I wouldn't count on it. How else are we gonna tell Santa what we want for Christmas? Did you hear that? Is that the ghost of Christmas? Don't be a cowardly custard. there's no such thing as the silly Christmas ghost. Ooooh! Boo! I gotcha. I wasn't afraid. I was just playing along. - Jonas was the one that was scared. - No I wasn't. It's fine to be afraid, guys. It happens to the best of us. Mother says that strong women are never afraid. Well, I always say it's fine to be scared as long as your courage outweighs your fear. Come on, let's go get some milk and cookies. Where are we going? Look over there. Santa: How did you put me out here? Santa's on his cell phone. Santa doesn't need a cell phone. - He makes magic calls. - Mm-hmm. - That's not the real Santa. - Yeah. You're right, it's not the real Santa. 'Cause the real Santa's making cookies with his elves in the North Pole. Jackie: If Santa's so magic, then why does he need a helper? Yeah. I don't know. Let's just go see him. Okay, hold on. - Ho ho ho ho. - Hi. Merry Christmas, honey. What do you want for Christmas? - A computer. - A computer? Wow, that's pretty good. But you know you've got to be good to get a computer, right? - Yes. - Okay. All right, sweetie. You go. Bye bye. Merry Christmas. Hello. Hi! I guess not. Ho ho ho! I'm sorry. - Merry Christmas. - Hi! Hi, sweetie. Oh my goodness, what do you want for Christmas? - A bunny. - A bunny? Wow. You know you got to be good to get a bunny, right? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Very good. - Woman: Merry Christmas. Well, what's your names, little ones? - I'm Jackie and this is Jonas. - Well, Jackie and Jonas, - what do you want for Christmas? - You tell him. We want our dad to come home for Christmas. Your dad to come home? Well, let's see what we can do, okay? Um, how about anything else? Like maybe a toy or something? - Something? - Uh, well, we do want a puppy. - Yeah, a puppy. - A puppy. Ha ha. Yeah. Well, how about we start out with just the books right now, okay? - Thank you, Santa. - Ho ho ho! Okay. Thank you, Santa. Ho ho ho, you... Oh God! Oh! Okay. - They don't have flax. - Or oats. - Or goat's milk. - That's okay. We're gonna try something new today. But we need our flax to give us our omega-3s and our fiber. Horses eat flax. Are you a horse? - No. - How old are you anyway? - I'm 12. - Then you should eat like a 12-year-old. Hey guys, what can I get for you? Three orders of pancakes and three large hot chocolates. You got it. - Oh, and extra powdered sugar. - Got that. But... that's loaded with fats and sugars. You're right. But when was the last time you had pancakes? - I can't remember. - So you're due. A little fat and sugar never hurt anybody. And what my grandpa used to always say is that moderation is the key to life. Oh. It's your phone. It's your daddy. - Hi, Daddy! - Hey. - How's my little munchkins? - Both: Good. - What are you guys doing? - We're having brunch with Miss Leeds. - Who's Miss Leeds? - Jonas: Our new nanny. Nanny? I didn't think your mother would really go through with it. Merry Christmas, Miss Leeds. Hi, Mr. Ryland. Don't worry, they're in good hands. Are you coming home for Christmas? Sweetie, you know I'd love to, but I'm in the middle of closing a big client right now and this could be really important for the company. But it's Christmas. I know. I'm doing the best I can. Man: Carl, we're ready for you. All right, listen, I gotta go. I love you both very much. And kiss your mother for me, okay? Love you, Dad. Bye. Okay, bye. So much for Santa Claus. You know what? Your mother's office is just up the block. I've never been to Mother's work before. Never? She doesn't like to mix business with her personal life. Mm-hmm. - I have an idea. - For you. And for you. - Okay? - Thank you. - Now this is what I call breakfast. - Agreed. Don't tell your mother. - Hi. - Oh. You probably should have called first. She's in meetings all day. I don't think this was such a good idea. It's all good, guys. Oh, you know what? I think I hear her coming. Mother! Oh. Uh, what a nice surprise. Since they've never visited you at work, I thought, they're on holiday break. Well, it- it would have been nice if you had called me first. They just think so much of what you do. They'd love to spend a few minutes seeing what it is that their mother does all day at work. Uh, okay. Um... well, let me take my little executives- in-the-making on the grand tour. Uh, will you hold my calls for 20 minutes? And Ally, help yourself to coffee. - Okay. - Come on, guys. Well, this must be my lucky day. Hey, it's the raspberry-scone guy. Yeah, well, otherwise known as Justin Larose. Ally Leeds. Also known as Ally Leeds. Are you busy right now? Me? I was just dropping off some pens and papers and a couple proposals. Well, I was about to grab an espresso. You want to join me? - Now? - Yeah. I- I don't know. - I've got to wait for- - Samantha? Yes, for Samantha. I- you know what? On second thought, - I've got 20 minutes till my next meeting. - That's great. Hold all my calls. I'll be back in 20. Hey, what can I get for you guys? Uh, two espressos and two chocolate-chip scones. - Yeah. - Thanks. So what exactly is it that you do for Samantha? I'm a consultant- a freelance consultant. Mm-hmm. Let's just say I take care of two of her most important assets. Wow. It's weird because I've never seen you around the office. Well, I work mostly with Carl out of the New York office. - Carl. How is he? - Good good. He was planning on trying to get back for the holidays, but it's just been so busy. What about you? Any holiday plans? Actually I wanted to get home to visit my parents in Ohio, but it looks like I might have to work. - Mmm. - Um, thank you. - You're welcome. - What about you? What are your plans for Christmas? Thank you. I was gonna go home to New Jersey to visit my family, but I haven't been able to get the time off. I'm trying to nail this Donner account. I haven't even gotten a tree yet. I'd love a real tree. It just reminds me of Christmas as a kid. You know, I just never have time to deal with it, so I just have a fake one. My mom would never let us have a real tree. She said the pine needles would get all over the house. Kind of a clean freak. Mmm, sounds like someone I know. Ever since I've been on my own, I make sure to get a real tree. The only problem is I always pick the wrong one. Last year I got one that dried up in a week. Well, maybe you need someone to come along with you, make sure you get a good one. Tomorrow night, we could have dinner and go pick out a tree or... - Or just pick out a tree. - Here's the thing though: Samantha doesn't really like coworkers mingling outside the office. - So... - Oh yeah, of course. ...we're gonna have to keep it between you and I. - Mum's the word. - All right. Oh, I remember you. You ready for a second round of those pancakes? By the way, your kids are two of the cutest kids I've ever seen, and so well-mannered. Thanks. Ki- you're- do you have children? Uh, no, I have a big family- lots of kids. I- I help out. They love the pancakes here. - That's sweet. - Mm-hmm. Mmm! You know what? I'm gonna be late for my meeting. - I've got to go. - Okay. But wait. Uh, so I'll see you tomorrow? It's a date. Or a tree. You know what I mean. # Up on the housetop reindeer pause # # Out jumps good old Santa Claus... # Man: So tell me what kind of Christmas tree you're looking for. No, a Hanukkah bush! All right, I got a great idea. Tell you what: we'll take a small one, we'll turn it upside down like a dreidel and we'll take a little off the bottom. A little sacrilegious, but I like where your head's at. We take a big one and we take a snip from the top. - What about this one? - Aw, it's too skinny. Vegetarian tree; you need a meat-eating tree. - All right, this one. - Too husky. Ah, the smell of pine needles is my favorite memory. Mine's ice skating. My family and I- we used to all go down to the pond and ice skate. - Really? Me too. - Really? Yeah. Oh, wait. Now this- this is the one- tall dark and handsome, just like you. Sold. Now what? I, um, wanted to tell you at dinner but I couldn't get up the nerve... You look beautiful tonight. Thank you. Oh oh! A fir tree-! - Let's go. - What about your tree? - We'll get one tomorrow. - Okay. Whoa whoa whoa ah ah ah! Oh! Every year at the pond, huh? I think it's these skates. They're too tight or something. Sure. Here, let me help you. What a cute couple. Follow my lead. If I could just take a few moments of your time to give you samples of one of the most elegant chocolates - in the entire world. - Justin: Thanks. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Now how about a picture to capture the moment? What- what is it that you do here exactly? Product placement. It's part of the promotion. Then I'll email you the picture of this moment being captured, and you'll be able to remember Danny Donner Chocolates. Okay. Wait, you're gonna- you're gonna take it with your cell phone? Well, the batteries died on my digital, - so I'm just gonna use this, okay? - Okay. Now get together, closer. - Say "Danny Donner. " - Both: Danny Donner. Perfect. Okay. - Thanks, guys. - All right. Wait, she didn't even get our email address. Oh. Oh, she probably forgot. Huh. Strange- this little chocolate is keeping me away from going home this year. Yeah, I know what you mean. Oh. - Sorry. - That's all right. Hello? - Hi, Miss Leeds. - Ally: Yeah, uh... Miss Leeds, it's Jackie. Mother just wanted us to tell you that she has a meeting and she wants you to come an hour early tomorrow. Uh, I have an 11:00 open. She wants us to spend the extra hour doing yoga poses, but we'll really play freeze tag, right? I think I can accommodate that. Okay. Bye. - Get off. - Oh! - Good? - Good. Now where were we? - Sorry. - Go ahead. Hello? Hey, Samantha. Yeah, I'm working on the pitch right now. Uh-huh. All right, you got it. I'll be there. I gotta go. She said that Donner wants to make a decision by the 24th and she called an early-morning meeting. I understand, you're busy. - We should- - We should do this again. - You go ahead. - No no no, you go. - You were about to ask me out again. - I was not. You were- it sounded like it. - I'll race you to the exit. - All right. Wait, that's not fair. Tina: It's funny. In all the years I've known you, you've never had a live Christmas tree. What happened to, "I don't have time for a real tree"? I don't know. I was just in the mood. Right. Sounds like someone's starting to fall for Mr. Executive. Oh, come on. Are you serious? I mean, he's kind of cute and funny. Listen to yourself. You're totally falling for this guy. Maybe. I mean, we just connect on so many levels, like personally and professionally. He doesn't know you're a nanny. - Not exactly. - What do you mean, "not exactly"? Well, I maybe kind of told him that I was a consultant working with Samantha. You can't lie to this guy, especially if you like him. It's not a lie. I mean technically I'm her consultant. No, technically you're her nanny. And you're gonna have to tell him eventually. Eventually. He's a high-level exec. I don't know how he'd take it. He should like you for who you are, not for what your job is. You know what? You're absolutely right. - So you're gonna tell him? - Eventually. It would just be easier if I had my old job back or something like it. Right? Oh, Ally. Hi. Come in. I've got your check here. Ah, here we go. - Thank you. - Thank you. I really appreciate everything that you've been doing. It's allowed me more time to focus on my work. And it's been important 'cause things have been tough lately. You know, it's the end of the year and I've got this big account I'm trying to close. Actually that's what I wanted to talk to you about. What's that? If there was a possibility of working on your advertising team. What's your interest? I graduated summa cum laude from Cornell; I have 10 years' experience; and I really feel like I would have something to offer on your advertising front. If you would just give me a chance, - I- I am sure that I- - Look, Ally, I've got one rule I've never broken: I don't mix my business life and my personal life, ever. I'm sorry. I understand. Let me offer a little advice: the advertising business is crazy. You don't want to do that. Stick with nannying. You're good at it. Great. Speaking of which, I need some OT from you on Friday night. It's the annual agency Christmas party and- and Carl and I have always tried to be inclusive when it comes to families. So it would be a tremendous help to me if you could bring the children and look after them, because I'm going to be busy that night. Besides, the whole company's going to be there. - The whole company? - Mm-hmm. We'll see you in the morning. All message playback. Hello, this is Gerard Muldooney from Exact Mortgage. This is a courtesy call to Ally Leeds to let you know that your mortgage- Hey, Ally, it's Justin. You know, you ran off so quick today, I was wondering, maybe we could grab a cup of coffee in the morning and continue the conversation? Ally: What's your favorite Christmas story? Um, "The Fir Tree. " Have you heard of it? "Out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree. " "The place he had was a very good one. " - You too? - Yeah. Our dad used to read it to us every Christmas Eve by the fireplace in our flannel pajamas. It's one of the first books I remember reading as a little girl. "The Fir Tree" by Hans Christian Andersen. I just- I never met anyone like you. And I don't understand how you could be so... perfect. Justin, I've been meaning to tell you something. I haven't been completely honest with you. You've been using me for my witty charm and dashing good looks. - Just your dashing good looks. - I know, I know. Oh, hold on one second. Samantha. - Hello. - Donner's coming. - Yeah yeah, okay. - I really need the pitch. - Yeah. - Can you get here? I'll be right there. You're never gonna believe this: she just called an emergency meeting. I gotta go into the office. Anything I can do to help with the big Donner pitch? Not unless you can weave some magic and come up with a great pitch. I've been known to cast a few spells. Really? Interesting. I may have to take you up on that. - Talk to you later? - You bet. - Hi, Samantha. - Ally, I need you to come over now. Okay, I'll be right there. Ally: Hey, Jackie? Jonas? It's just me, Ally. Man on TV: My merry band of reindeer are sending you right to the naughty list. - Hello? - Ally. Look, my associate Justin Larose is coming by the house to pick up a file. - Please let him in. - Of course, Miss Ryland. It's in my bedroom. Thank you. Man on TV: The laser beam, jumpin' jolly! Man #2: Quick, to the getaway sleigh. Donner, Blitzen... - Justin. - Hey, I hope I'm not disturbing you. No, not at all. What's up? I was wondering if you wanted to come over tonight. You know, make it up to you for cutting out early. We could watch some old Christmas movies, - eat candy canes. - That sounds great. - Um, I'll- I'll see you then. - All right, see you tonight. Okay. I need to hide. Why? I'll explain everything later. I know, it's a tough door. Just don't tell him I'm here. Okay. Samantha, hey. Yeah, it's not here. What do you mean, "It's not here"? Of course it's there. Look again. I looked. The right side? The bed's right? The other one. All right, I'll check the other side. I'll check. Wait wait wait wait. All right, I got it. I'm on my way. Is he gone? - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm gonna let you guys in on a little secret, okay? Justin and I have been dating. Gross. He's cute. Very. But you have to promise me you won't tell your mother. - Why? - It's complicated. Because Justin and I both work for your mother, it's a conflict of interest. Just promise me you won't say anything. - Promise. - Jackie? But why can't you tell him you're our nanny? I just can't right now. Are you afraid he won't like you? Lying is bad. It's just a little white lie. Mother says there's no such thing as a little white lie. Santa's gonna put you on the top of his naughty list. Santa will understand. Do you want some ice cream? Boing boing boing boing! - Tag! - Tag, you're it. - Ally! Ally! Ally! Ally! - You're supposed to freeze. Ally, Ally, come on, let's dance. - Ally, Ally! - Come on, Ally. Come on. - What is it? - What's what? Something's bothering you. I can tell. Is it Justin? No. It's just that Justin and your mom have a really important meeting coming up and I want everything to go really well. - Then help them. - I wish I could. Anyways, enough about me. Jonas, why don't you read us a story? "'Twas the night before Christmas... " Mother used to read us this story. Remember, Jonas? And Dad used to sneak us chocolate candy canes. Hang on, what- what did you say? Dad used to sneak us chocolate candy canes. Mother has read us this story? You know what? My mother used to do the exact same thing. Wait, start reading it again. "'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. " "The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there; The children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads. " You guys are geniuses! Oh! Thank you. # Joy to the world, the Lord is come... # # Let earth receive her king... # Justin: Hello? Ally: Hey, Justin, I've got something big to tell you. I'll meet you outside your apartment in 10 minutes. Yeah, okay. # And heaven and heaven and nature sing... # - Hi. - Hey! Sorry. I have an idea that'll save Donner. Listen, it's kinda late. You asked me to weave some magic. Let me weave some magic. All right, what do you got? One word: Christmas. Seems kind of obvious, doesn't it? Think about it: Danny Donner isn't just selling chocolates; they're selling memories of Christmas youth. I mean, everyone young and old always remembers the magic that Christmas brings- the anticipation, the joy, the love. With every bite of Danny Donner Chocolates, you get to relive those memories over and over again. It's pretty good. What was the first thing you said about, uh, memories and- This is unbelievable. Nothing. Justin. - I got it. - Where have you been? - I have been trying to call you. - I know. - You can't leave Danny Donner- - I came up with the perfect pitch. I've been working on it all night. We've been working on the pitch for days. I know. This is a winner. Trust me. You're three and a half minutes late. I know, Mr. Donner. I'm sorry. LA traffic. It takes 45 minutes to go five miles in this town. You should know that, son. Hell, I once herded an elephant from the outskirts of Johannesburg to the city center in less time than it would take you to go from the valley to the hills. That's why I hate coming to this town unless I absolutely have to. But enough chit-chat. Why don't you tell me how your company is gonna help me sell more chocolate? Danny Donner isn't selling chocolate. Ha! And we're done. Danny Donner is selling the memories of Christmas youth. Everyone both young and old remembers the magic that Christmas brought into their lives- the anticipation, the love, the joy. And with every bite of Danny Donner Chocolates, those memories can be relived over and over again, coupled with a timeless poem we all know and love. A poem? I like- I like poems. All right, I'm listening. Go on. People will be brought back to the magic of their childhood. And they'll want to share that experience with their kids. It's an interesting concept, but how do you propose we execute that? With a little bit of creativity. "'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes... " they were filled with Danny Donner chocolate bears. The kids- the kids nestled all snug in their bed, while visions of Danny Donner candy canes danced in their heads. That's it? That's it. Well, I like it. Perfect for next Christmas. Now get on Valentine's Day. You got the job. - Oh my God. You did it. - I did it. I did it well. You did it so well. And you would have been so fired if you hadn't. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - That's a promise. I can't believe he won everybody over with my pitch. But that was the goal, wasn't it? To save Donner and everybody's job? Yeah, but I didn't think it'd actually work. Look, you should be happy. After all, this proves you do have what it takes. It proves Samantha wrong. Yeah, but what about me? I'm still just a nanny. Oh, is that why you did this? For you? No. Maybe. I don't know. Well, you'd better think about it. Justin: So I was thinking, I want you to be my date for the annual Christmas party. Uh, well, what about Samantha's rule about not mixing business with personal? Yeah, I just saved the woman's company. I think she'll get over it. Besides, since when is work personal? I don't know. I just- you know how Samantha is about her rules. You don't want to go with me? - Of course I do. - Then I'll pick you up at 8:00. I- You know what? I have a meeting right before. - Why don't I just meet you at the party? - All right, sold. So I'm gonna go get a pretzel and a soda. Do you want anything? - Ditto. - All right. Are you crazy? Aren't you supposed to take Samantha's kids to that party? Were you eavesdropping on my conversation? A little. I'm just gonna have to be consultant/ girlfriend/date to Justin, and nanny to Samantha and the kids. If Justin finds out you've been lying to him this whole time, he's not gonna forgive you. It's over. If Samantha finds out I've been dating Justin behind her back and feeding him pitch ideas, there's no telling what she'll do. This is the last time I'm recommending you for a job. Get out of here. He's coming back. # When the Christmas lights are twinkling # # And the glistening snow has fallen... # Ally: Okay, guys, Operation Incognito is in effect. I'm going in. You guys wait for me at the bar. If I'm not back by the stroke of midnight, - burn my stocking. - Jonas: Good luck. Now remember, you guys are the lookouts. You've got to keep your eyes on your mother at all times. - Jackie: Good luck, Miss Leeds. - Thank you. No, I skinned the rhinoceros. And that's the end. Endless. Expression was stone-cold till the very end when he told us we had the account. Look look look. Ah, look who's here. Hi, my princess. - Hello, my prince. - Hello. - Meet Jeff, Peter. - Hey, guys. How you doin' there? - This is Jonas and Jackie. - Looking sharp. Guys, why don't you go get something to eat? I think there's a vegetable platter over there. Go try it- broccoli, carrots, celery. Ally, I'd like to introduce you to some people. This is Jeff from Accounting. Miss Ally Leeds, my nanny. - Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. - And Peter from Operations. - It's a pleasure. - Good to meet you. - Did Justin get here? Not yet. Fashionably late as usual. - There he is. - Ah, Justin. - I have to go to the bathroom. - Hold on. I want to introduce you to someone. The man of the hour, Justin Larose. Miss Ally Leeds. - It's a pleasure. - Nice to meet you. - Pardon me one moment. - Mm-hmm. You okay? No, I- I need to tell you something. - What? - I'm not really- We heard you really rocked that Donner pitch. Yeah, good work. Yeah. Do you guys know Ally Leeds? She works for Samantha. - Yeah, she's Samantha's- - Jeff and Peter, of course, from Accounts and Operations. How's everything adding up over there? You guys having fun? Excuse me. I need to step away for a second. Huh. She usually doesn't act mentally disturbed. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to take you back in time, back to when Danny Donner was just a little boy- a little boy who like to eat chocolate, especially around Christmas time. And it was around that time where young Danny Donner had a big dream- a dream to be the biggest chocolatier in the world. People made fun of me. They laughed. Some people say that dreamers walk around this earth with their head in the clouds. Well, I say it's better to walk with your head in the clouds dreaming than with your feet on the ground sleepwalking. Right now I'd like to take this moment to recognize a gentleman whose pitch brought me back to the memories of my youth. Justin Larose, come on up here. Come on up and say a few words. Thank you. Um, wow, this is unexpected. For as long as I've worked here, I've worked very hard to come up with dynamic pitches. And- we all have. And when our backs were against the wall, we all- we all dug deep. To be quite honest, I had some- some trouble finding the right pitch for Donner. But then something happened to me. I met a beautiful girl who not only won my heart, but came up with a great idea that inspired my pitch. So all of this praise actually belongs to her, a consultant who's worked for the company for quite some time in the New York office- Ally Leeds. Ally? Where are you, Ally? Huh, I don't know where she went off to. But anyway, merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah and drink all night. # Joy to the world, the Lord has come # # Let earth receive her king # # And every heart # # Prepare... # Ally? Where you goin'? Uh, I'm taking the kids home. I'm not feeling well. Really? Are you okay? Yeah, I- Hey, Samantha. So you two have been seeing each other behind my back? Yeah. And I'm sorry, Samantha. I wanted to tell you. I- Justin, look, just because I don't believe in mixing business and pleasure doesn't mean that you have to. I mean, one never knows where Cupid's arrow might land. But before you fall too deeply, you might want to know that Miss Leeds has never been a consultant here. What are you- what are you talking about? You tell him. I am- I'm her nanny. What? Is that true? Jonas, Jackie, we're going back to the party. Oh, Miss Leeds, don't bother coming to work tomorrow. You're fired. You've been lying to me? I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. I just- Miss Leeds? I know what you're going through. Don't let him get away. Justin, wait. - Justin: Are you okay? - Ally: I'm fine. You've got a little something on your chin. - Good? - Yeah. - # You can't control... # - I gotta go. # The way of the world so # # Live in the moment # # With love in your hearts # # And all of our memories frozen in time... # Justin: Well, this must be my lucky day. Ally: Hey, it's the raspberry-scone guy. - Yeah, otherwise known as Justin Larose. - Ally Leeds, also known as Ally Leeds. Justin: It's just I've never met anyone like you. And I don't understand how you could be so perfect. # Better than this # # Better than this. # - Are you awake? - Yeah. I miss Miss Leeds. She was the best nanny we ever had. I don't understand why Mother had to fire her. She helped everyone. It was a rotten thing to do around Christmas time. Breakfast! - Pancakes? - Yeah. I remember they used to be your favorite, right? Aren't they unhealthy? Come in, it's open. Good morning. So everybody was worried when you didn't come into the office today. Mmm. There are gonna be some changes around here. Fantastic. But I still need your signature for these Donner account files. Mmm. So should I tell everybody that you won't be coming in today? Yeah sure. We can talk about it more at the Christmas party. - Christmas party? - We're having a party? Yeah. I decided it just doesn't feel like Christmas around here without having a party like we used to, you know? - Will Daddy be coming? - Yeah, will Daddy be coming? I'm really not sure. - You look terrible. - Thank you, but I'm fine. You should have some pancakes. Um, ahem, did your mother just offer me pancakes? So will you be coming to the Christmas party? - I wouldn't miss it. - Will you be bringing a date? Miss Leeds? Um, I don't think so, no. - Well, it would be nice to see her. - Yeah. It would be nice to see her again. Listen, I'll talk to you guys later. - Okay. - Okay. - Bye, Samantha. - Bye, Justin. Oh! Almost forgot- dessert. But we haven't finished breakfast. It's upside-down day. You do everything backwards. So that's it? You're just gonna pack up and run back to Ohio? I put the house up for sale. Now that I'm jobless, I can't afford to pay the mortgage. You were never a quitter. I finally meet a guy that I really care about and now he hates me. You're right. I should have never lied to Justin. I ruined everything. I'm going home. Hello? - It's me, Jackie. - Jackie, is everything okay? Everything's fine, but Mother told me to give you a very important message. She did, huh? She wants you to come to our Christmas party tonight. Christmas party? I don't know, I- I'm leaving town. Please. She really really wants to see you there. I'll see what I can do. Great. See you there. Are you crazy? This is a chance to redeem yourself. I can't go to that thing. - You're afraid. - Don't be silly. What's that classic saying you always preach to everybody? "It's okay to be afraid as long as your courage outweighs your fear. " Samantha obviously wants to make amends. You have to go. I can't face them. It's embarrassing. Justin will be there. And that's exactly why I definitely can't go. Everybody makes mistakes. All you have to do is apologize. If it's from the heart, he'll forgive you. I can't do it. Fine. Merry Christmas. A day of beauty on me. I'm gonna miss you, Tina. Make sure you dress warm. It's freezing in Ohio. - You need help? - Yeah. Samantha: Oh my goodness, we've got elves. We've got a lot of elves in our house. - Hi, beautiful. - Hi, Mama. Look at all of you. Oh my goodness, so nice to finally meet you. - You have a beautiful home. - Oh, thank you so much. - You remember Hannah? - Hi, sweetheart. - Hello. - How are you? Ho ho ho. Pardon me. Hi, guys. You need cookies. Somebody get them some cookies. Hey, merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Justin. So am I imagining this, or is Samantha Ryland being festive? Uh, you're imagining it. I thought so. Thank you for coming. Thanks for having me. Listen, I- I know I don't say it very often, but I'm really proud of you. It means- it means a lot, especially coming from you. Thanks for being here. Ah, have you met my neighbors, the Edelsteins? Hi. Hi, darling, how are you? - Merry Christmas. - This is my right-hand man. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Great recommendation. - Nice to meet you. - Aren't these great decorations? - Thank you so much. Pardon me, the doorbell's ringing. Justin: So is she a good neighbor? Hey, Samantha. Uh, Ally. What are you doing here? You invited me. Jackie. There's been a mistake. But before I leave, I'd really like to take this chance to apologize. Um, look, Ally... you broke the rules of my house. And you broke the rules of my office. And then on top of all that, you lied about it. The truth is that you saved my company. Thank you. I appreciate that. It's Christmas. Come on in. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Justin, words can't... describe how sorry I am for deceiving you. It started as a little white lie and then it spiraled out of control. And I've learned that there's no such thing as a little white lie. Did you really think that I would care if you were a nanny? Yes, I did. You were a big-shot executive. I thought you wanted more. All I ever wanted was you. It didn't matter what you were. Not to mention the fact that I babysat my nieces till I was 25. - It's what paid my way through college. - No you didn't. I didn't. I'm lying. Look there- now we're even. Can we start over? I'm Ally Leeds, currently unemployed. And I'm Justin Larose. It's a pleasure. Look where you're standing! I wonder who put that there. Daddy! Daddy! - Ha ha ha! Sweetie! - Daddy! Hey, sweetie. Hi. - I missed you. - I missed you. What are you doing home? I didn't think you were coming. Well, I wasn't, but then somebody sent me that email about how you and the kids couldn't stand to have Christmas without me. What email? You know what I learned while I was gone? That family is more important than any company or anything else. We're so happy to have you back. Oh, and you know what? I don't know, but Santa must have left this outside. Let's take a look. - Oh, a puppy! - Oh! You must be Ally Leeds. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Mr. Ryland. Oh please, call me Carl. Great job with Donner. You are a hero in the New York office. Thank you. Thank you. So you threw a party, huh? - It just didn't feel like Christmas. - Yeah? And now it does? Jonas: What should we name him? I've made a decision that I want to discuss with the two of you. I'm going to take a year sabbatical. I want to spend more time with my family. Ally, you opened my eyes to the kind of mother that I was and helped me realize the kind of mother I want to be. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Now I'm not comfortable leaving the agency shorthanded. And although I once said that you weren't boardroom material, I was wrong. So since Justin will be taking over for me- I am? - I need somebody to fill in his position. I'd be honored if you'd accept. I've already talked to Donner about it. He thinks it's a great idea. What about your rule about- I've realized some rules are meant to be broken. Thank you. And I accept. So skedaddle.
