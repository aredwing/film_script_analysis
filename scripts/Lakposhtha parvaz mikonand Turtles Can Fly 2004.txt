TURTLES CAN FLY Written and Directed by Bahman Ghobadi Pashow, tell my dad to turn the antenna to the right! Esmaeel, to the right, the right! Your son says to the right. Pashow, tell my dad to turn it to the left! Ali, to the left, to the left! It has noises. There's no image. Look what Saddam has done to us! We have no water, no electricity, and no schools. They have deprived us from the sky. They don't let our TVs work to see when the war will start. Is it you Satellite? Hey, is it you Satellite? Yes, what is it? I need some rope. Come back tomorrow! - I need it now. - I said tomorrow! I said I need it now. All right, fine! How much do you want? Pashow! Satellite, come here for a minute! My name is Soran. Everyone calls me Satellite. Sit down! I know this girl. She is from Halabcheh. Halabcheh?! How do you know? I know! Her parents were killed. They came to the village yesterday. They want to go to the border with the rest of the refugees. She has a brother who went on the mines. He lost his arms. He hit Abdolrahman with his head. His nose started to bleed. He hit him like this. - Don't tell anyone! - Okay. Why didn't you give me the rope? Only 2 or 3 meters was left. I'll give you more later. - How much shall I pay? - No! Don't even mention the money. - But I have to pay. - No! See you later! Thank you! Come to me if you need anything! Hey, what are you doing? Why aren't you turning the antenna? Turn it! Esmaeel, I'm tired. You can't get pictures with this antenna. I swear you won't ever get pictures in this village with this antenna. I said you should buy a satellite. A satellite! The village governor says the satellite is prohibited. Don't say that! The sexy and dance channels are prohibited, not the news. I installed satellites for all the villages around here. Do you know "Sargolli" village? With just 20 families, they bought a satellite! - They did? - Yes! How strange! You are 70 families here, why don't you buy one? It's bad for your reputation! But we are only 30 families. Just 30! What about the houses on that side? Now they are in Turkey. They have separated us. They won't let them pay for the satellite. Your wife was from that side. Now you're strangers? They have separated us. Not long now before USA comes! What's USA? USA means America. Have you seen the movie Titanic? Titanic, Washington, San Francisco, Bruce Lee, Zinedine Zidane. Zeinedin Zeidan is not American. He is not American. He's French and a Muslim. I know him well. - Hello! - Hello! - Where is this car going? - It's going to Arbil. Let's go! Are you an Iranian Kurd? Yes! I am an Iranian Kurd, and a doctor. Why have you come to Iraq in this chaos? This is the fourth time I've come. I come, I go. I come, I go. I'm looking for an orphan. I think he's from Arbil. He's driven me nuts. I don't know where to find him. I know him. I know as well too doctor. What? How do you know me? We were sitting in the same car a few months ago. You were going to Solaymaneyeh from Kirkuk, looking for the orphan. Exactly! How do you know him? You're looking for the boy, who makes predications, right? Yes, do you have news of him? I do and I don't, "I don't know." - What does "I don't know" mean? - It's chaos everywhere. "I don't know" means I have no idea. - Are you pulling my leg? - No, I know him. Don't listen to this boy! It's all lies. That boy is very important. He makes predictions. These days money is in the news. My God! Have you come from Iran for that? What are you saying? War! The world is at war. Everybody's after news. The boy is lying! Buy a satellite to get the news. A satellite? What for? It's all lies. They lie and fill their pockets. Stop! Stop! Pashow, who gave them permission to come here? I don't know. Tell them to go to Karim's land! Hurry up! - Shouldn't I come with you? - Hurry! Hurry up! Wait here! Hello! Hello! I've come with them from "Kanibo" to buy a satellite dish. It's too expensive. You can't buy one. How much is it? Maybe I can give you some discount. - Don't you have any cheaper ones? - It's war; it's the end of the world. If you don't have money, don't buy it. I have a few radios. Can we exchange? Radios? Radios have no value any more. Only cash for satellites. Can we can give you some radios and pay half in cash? What? Half of it in radios and half of it in cash. Okay, how many radios do you have? - How much cash? - 500. Put those on the table! Okay take the dish! "Hello Mr.!" "How are you?" Hello, satellite! Have you seen these mines? Who found them? The armless boy who hit Abdol Rahman in the face. Didn't I tell you to work on Karim's land? The boy didn't let us go there. He told us to work on this field. It's full of mines. I don't know how he found out. It's unbelievable! All of this is my work. I did the work of 3 days in one day. I told you only to collect American mines. He said there is no difference between Italian and American mines. He said anybody who says the opposite is a liar. Liar? He called me a liar? Where is he? He is there! Where? There! Up there! Hey, you! Come down! Hey, come down! Why don't you come down? This place is full of mines. Did you call me a liar? How dare you talk like that? Come down here if you're a man! Nobody has ever called me a liar. Look at that filth! The armless boy calls me a liar. Do you understand? I'm talking to you. You are the liar. Can't you hear me? Are you deaf? If you call me a liar again, I'll give you a good beating! I know you well. I won't say anything... because of your sister. Do you get it? Don't go, Hengov! - Are you talking to me? - I know you well. - I said are you talking to me? - Yes, to you! Satellite! What happened, Satellite? Blood! Blood! Move out of the way! Did you just hit me? Come back! Look at him! He doesn't dare stop. I'll forgive you for your sister. It better be your last time. Stop if you dare! I'll cut off both your legs too. Bring it! Bring it! "Come on! Come on!" This way! Esmaeel, I've brought you my antenna. You won't find another one like this anywhere else in the world. Don't lie so much! Didn't we buy it together in Arbil? Bring it! Be careful with it! Be careful! Watch your hands! Go down by the count of 3! "One, two, three!" Shirkooh, you go down too! Satellite! What does "Come on" mean? "Come on!" means go down. Hurry up! - Hello! - Hello! We've come to see war news. What do the foreign channels say? There's no news, nothing. Go back to your homes! There's no need for all of you to come here. Go back to your tents! We'll announce the news on the mosque speaker. - Are you sure? - Yes, of course! Go back to your tents! We'll give you the news on the speaker. You don't have to worry while I'm here. Hello! Who are they? They are the elders of the village and the governor is here. They want to see the news. Don't show the prohibited channels! Okay! Who told you to touch it? Go to the mosque! - What for? - Bring the mosque microphone. - What if the governor doesn't accept? - The governor is here himself. Hurry up! Okay! I have to go now. Where to? Tell us what it's saying! We don't understand. My job was to install the dish, which I did. I have to go now. I did my job. I'm responsible for the village children. I have to make income for them. I'll give you money. I'll give you accommodation. - Accommodation? You won't. - I will. No, you won't. Last time you promised but you didn't. I will. Come and sit down! We will help you. I told you not to show the prohibited channels. Change it! Don't hit me! I'm looking for a news channel. Change it! Change it! It's prohibited! Here is Mr. Bush, Esmaeel! The world is in his hands! I know! I know! The world is in his hands. What is this Bush saying? Let the teacher come and tell you. It's not my job. - He doesn't know anything! - The teacher doesn't know anything? I saw him write 28 letters in English to Mr. Bush with my own eyes. Try to understand! Try your best! Tell us what they are saying. He says it will rain tomorrow. What has it got to do with rain? He keeps saying it will rain tomorrow! What's the relationship? - I think it's a code! - What code? Here Satellite! The mosque microphone! Go! I'll come in a minute. Here is Saddam! I'm done here. You understand Arabic. Where are you going? We need you. All the village children are waiting for me. I have to go. Come back for the news tonight! I want to know about the war. All right! We'll see. Riga? Agrin, where's Riga? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? What's this child doing here? - Whose child are you? - Why are you crying? What's your name? I think it's the brother of the girl from Halabcheh. Don't cry! Don't cry! Look! I scared him. He's gone. - How many is this? - Leave him alone! He can't see. Look what I'm doing with the Turk soldier. Hey, Effendi! Hey Mr.! Are you fine? Do you want us to start a war? Hey, let's go before he kills us. We didn't want to harm your brother. He was standing at the border and he was crying. He could've got killed. If it weren't for Satellite your brother would be dead. My bike! What are you doing here? Where's my bike? I saw your bike here. I waited for you but you didn't come. Then Esmaeel came and asked where you were. I told him I didn't know. He wanted to take your bike with him. I told him not to. He said he would. I said no. Again he said he would. I told him I won't let him. He slapped me on both cheeks, like this and took the bike. Why did you let him? He said Satellite must come and translate the news for us. How dare he take my chastity? Pashow, go with him! Tell him I can't translate during the day, maybe a little at night. I'll go from this village. Tell him all the villages in the region want me. If he doesn't bring my bike back, I'll leave this village with the dish. If they don't return the bike, I'll leave now. Go, tell him! Bring it up! Watch the mud! Follow me! Esmaeel sent his regards. He said don't leave. He said whatever Satellite says is fine. Where are the kids? They are collecting mines with the armless boy. With him? Those who work for me aren't allowed to work with him. I won't buy mines today, understand? Those who want to work with me must come to the shell field tomorrow. Goodbye forever to those who don't work with me! Why are you crying again? I went after your bike with them. Esmaeel called me and slapped me again twice, like this. I asked why he hit me. He said it was my ration for tomorrow! Come on! Bring me down! Go to your home kids! We'll go to the shell field tomorrow! Come and sit here! Watch your child! I will only give 10 Dinars to those who want to work today. Daddy! Daddy! Mummy! Satellite! Yes! What is it? The armless boy said something will happen to those working in that truck. - Who said this? - The armless boy. - Which truck? - That one! I swear I heard it with my own ears. He left with his brother and sister. Kids, kids, listen to me! Those working in that truck, evacuate the place immediately. Quickly! Something may explode! Satellite! Not all of them are our boys. It's doesn't matter. Everyone get off! Aren't you getting off? My kids get off now! Hurry up! Hold my bike! Hey you! Wait! Hey! Don't you know someone like yourself who has no arms? And who can tell the future? You don't? You know it's you. I won't tell anyone. Make some predications for us! Slowly, slowly! Listen! Use this mask when you see white smoke. Don't use it for black smoke! It's only for smoke smelling of garlic and grass. There is a mask for every family. Those who don't have masks must go under water or in the river... ...during a chemical attack. If you don't find water, go to high places. Look at this boy to learn how to use it! Listen, war doesn't warn of its coming. Bombardment could start any time. Put the mask on like this and pull it down over your face. Come! Don't you want a mask? Shirkooh, come here! Yes, Satellite! At your service! Give this mask to that girl! Tell her I'll find a smaller mask for her brother. Hello! Satellite has sent this mask for you. He said he would find one for your brother. Out of the way! Sorry! It's Satellite's orders! Goodbye! He said he will definitely find one for your brother too. This way! This way! That's fine! Now go down! This is the house I promised you. Today we have many customers. OK, relax! I am talking to the refugee children, not the village children. Today you will clear Aziz's field from mines. Wait there until my representative arrives! - Where are you going? - To Aziz's field! - OK! - OK! You can go and gather the mines there. If anybody makes trouble, I'll deal with him. I'll count to three. "One! Two! Go!" Get out! Get out! Now, you come with me to see the Mr. Wait here! I'll go and bargain. I'll try to sell the mines at the best price. Let's go! "Hello, Mr.! How are you?" Why don't you speak properly? What was that, Ahmad? There's money in "Hello" these days. If I don't say hello, no one answers back. Do you see these boys? They don't know you're Kurd. They think you're a foreigner. The Americans are coming. Learn two "OKs" and all will be fine. "OK, Mr.! How much mine?" How much for the mines today? - How many have you got? - 96. You used to bring 10 or 15. What's happened? Don't think about that! How much? What? 22 Dinars? Are you pulling my leg? You paid more before. You think I don't know that you sell them to UN for 2200 Dinars each? I even know how much they get for it. Even their dogs make 50 times more than our children do! And they give them a can of food to eat as well! You can help our kids as a Kurd. Are you kidding me? I don't care if you sell or not. Go and sell them to the Mr. yourself. Give me a higher price, OK! OK! I'll try. Now go! "Thank you very much Mr.!!" Come down! Come down! OK! OK! I arranged everything. It was hard work fixing things up. What would you do without me?! These people have come after the children. - Where are they? - They're waiting. Hey, Satellite! What about our lands? We've been waiting since morning. Wait a minute! I talked to him until he agreed. Go back to your homes now! Get your mines! Then go to the Mr. with Pashow, the guy who has a pony-tail! When you get there, give him the mines and get your money. What about my land? How many children do you want? Send them all! It's ten days since the last mine collection. OK! OK! You and you! Me? Take care of yourselves! Half of them don't have hands! So what? They are not afraid of mines. They are our best. - How many do you want Karim? - 50. I'll send you 5. You, you, you... Satellite! The girl from Halabcheh! Pashow, look after the children! I'll be back soon. Out of the way! My cap! My cap! Thank you! I'm at your service. Agrin today is a strange day for me. How do you know my name? That is beside the point. Anyhow, today is important. Why? Why? Do you see this bike? This is the first time I am carrying water on it. And it's just for you. All the villages around here take their brides home on this bike. I'll take it myself. Don't say that! I am at your service. Any news of your brother? Does he have any predictions for us? No! Nothing at all? - My brother doesn't do it anymore. - Why? He made predictions twice and it brought us bad luck twice. What happened? Don't you want to tell me? - Give it to me! I'll take it. - I am at your service. Please! - Is this a spring as well? - Yes! - Why don't they take water from here? - I'm the only one who does. Why? The villagers say the water is impure. Why? Last year, three children came here to look for red fish and never came up. I think they drowned. I swear I dived to the bottom. I saw many fish, but no children. - Is it very deep? - Yes. Are there red fish in it? Yes, I saw them myself. - Did you really see them? - Don't you believe me? - Can you go to the bottom? - Yes, I'll do it now. If I ask you something will you get upset? No! As you're from Halabcheh, do you know someone like yourself who doesn't have anyone in this world, like you or I? It's okay if she has two brothers! Have you lost anyone? No, I haven't lost anyone. I have another point. I have been looking for a girl like you, for years. Where are you going? Didn't you want me to catch you fish? I'll go now. Look! Wait! Wait! I'll catch red fish for you! Are you awake? I know why you can't sleep. When are we leaving here? Don't you want to tell me? Put the child in the middle maybe we can sleep. You won't be able to sleep unless you learn to like the child. How many times do I have to tell you he's not my child. Don't say it isn't! You say such things... The rope around his foot opens mysteriously and he walks in his sleep. Hengov, I have a toothache. Are you still in pain? Is it bad? Yes, it is painful. Put some kerosene on it! Don't pull my hair! I said let go of my hair. Hey, why are you hitting the child? Agrin, where did you take him? I don't know. How come? Why is his nose bleeding? I don't know. I can't take care of a bastard all night long! What was that? You said bastard again? If he is not a bastard, then what is he? Isn't he the child of those who killed our family and did this to me? Now he's my child? Come into my arms! Don't cry! Don't cry! Cover him! Put the blanket on him! - Where are you taking him? - None of your business! Wait! Wait! Where is this boy going? Come down! It is a good opportunity to help him. What about me? Wait here until I come back! Agrin! Enough. Leave her alone! Where are you going in such a hurry? The boy has made an important prediction. Out of the way. Hello! Attention! Attention! Important notice for the villagers of "Kanibo"! For the refugees who live around here. Everyone must climb the hill! The war will begin in a few hours. The war between Iraq and America will start. Are you serious? Yes! There will be war. Save yourselves! They didn't say anything on the news. The satellite will announce it now! Climb the hill! Stand as still as trees! What are you doing here? Why aren't you on the hill? Like the others? I want to put my turtles in the water. I hope this prediction is not a lie. All the people are on the hill. If you've lied, I'll lose face. I told them it was true and the war's about to start. I said the USA planes are coming. I lied that I had heard the news on the satellite this morning. I hope it is not a joke. I hear something. I swear I do. - It's the sound of it! - What noise? The noise of American passports! Where are you? Only this much left to America! Let's go! Over here it's written: "It's the end of injustice, misfortune and hardship." "We are your best friends and brothers." "Those against us are our enemies." "We will make this country a paradise." "We are here to take away your sorrows." "We are the best in the world." We can only rent two weapons for three months with these mines. Get the hill behind the school and Rahman's roof ready. OK! Go and get them! It's a bad situation! Come on kids! - Hello! - Hello! Welcome! - How are you Abdol Salam? - Welcome Satellite! Long time no see! I've come to take two weapons for "Kanibo". The Russian PKC type! They are expensive. The price has gone up. They're 3500, 3600 Dinars. I don't want to buy it; I want to rent it for three months. For rent? For three months it'll be 600, 650 Dinars. I've got 500, 600 Dinars worth of mines. OK! Put them over there! Come here! Turn around! I picked these mines myself. - Do you have any small masks? - I'll bring some soon. These are American mines. First class. Give him the weapons! These are good weapons. Don't ruin them! Pashow put these in the bag! These bullets aren't enough. I'll give you more when you need some. How much is this necklace? It's "International"! Satellite, what does "International" mean? This is no time for questions. Go! Goodbye till next time! I'm fed up. When will we leave? We will leave soon. Be patient! I can't stand anymore. What are we doing here? Why aren't we leaving? I had a dream. We'll go in two or three days, when the child is cured. We'll go together. We won't leave together. If you're trying to cure the child, I won't come. If you don't come, I'll go alone. The child understands everything. Lower your voice! How many times must I tell you? Everyone's leaving. Only we're left. Uncle Hengov, will you remove this? Of course! Come closer! Does it hurt? Remove it! Let me see! Look, it is not bleeding now! - What is this? - Throw it away! If you don't come, I'll go alone. You say you want to go everyday. Why don't you leave then? Leave if you want to! How can I go alone? How would you manage with the child? Let's leave. If we don't leave this child now, we will never be able to do that. Let's go! Someone will find him and take care of him. We'll all go together. We won't go with him. What will we tell people when he grows up? Shall we say we found him in the streets? What will we tell him when he grows up? Hengov, let's go! Somebody will take him! I'm leaving. Mummy! Where are you? Hurry! Hurry up! Quick! Didn't I say no one is allowed to have weapons in the school? Teacher, how are you today? Do you think this is a good place for shooting? The white flag is enough. This is the best place for weapons. The best place. Oh, brother! Hey, work hard! Hey you, work harder! All you do is go to villages and mess them up. You'll make trouble for the kids someday. What? Me? Did I mess them up? Do I make trouble for the children? If it hadn't been for me, they would have been jobless. Can't you hear the explosions? War is coming closer to us. It's war, teacher! We have to get weapons ready. Hey, why aren't you listening? Teach them Math and Science! They know Math and Science. They have to learn how to shoot now. They have to learn how to use masks. Look teacher! Shirkooh! What's 40 times 5? Pashow! What's 240 minus 100? See, teacher! They know all of it. They have to learn how to fight now. Dig! Dig! Well done! Dig! Dig! The brother of the armless boy has gone on a mine. - Who? - The brother of the armless boy. Hurry! Someone go and find the brother! He hasn't walked on a mine! Who said that? Stay where you are! Don't move! - How long has he been there? - Since morning, Satellite. Don't move! Don't move! - Are you talking to me? - Yes! If you move you'll die. Please don't move! I'll come over to you. - What? - There are mines all around you. What? I shouldn't move? Are there mines here? - Has anybody gone to get his brother? - Yes! Don't move! I'll come over to you. Everyone quiet! I'm coming. I'm coming. Don't move! I'm coming. Satellite, please don't go there! Don't move! I'm coming. Don't move! - Satellite, please don't go there! - He's right, don't go! Don't move! I'm coming. Bring the bike! Don't go further! I want the bike. Honk. Ok! I'll do it for you. Bring the bike! I've brought it. Don't move! - Why don't you honk? - Wait! Wait! - I want the bike. - OK! I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. Satellite, Please don't go there! I had a nightmare last night. Don't go! Satellite, for God's sake! Don't cry! I beg you to let me or Pashow go there. What? Look at my leg! Do you want me to lose the other one too? Satellite is a good person. Let us go there! - Everyone clap for Pashow! - No need for that! Let his brother go there! Enough! Don't talk! Here's your bike! I've brought red fish, for you. Don't move! Stay where you are! There are some mines over there! If you don't come forward I'll give this to you. Wait, don't come forward, I'll give it to you. Don't touch it! It's a mine. Bring him inside! Bring him! Don't cry! Don't cry! How many times must I tell you not to play with such things? Put him there. Esmaeel, slower! Slowly! Don't worry! It's nothing! It will be fine! My leg! I'll bring a doctor for you tonight. You kept saying USA, USA until you fell on a USA mine. I'll go fetch the doctor. Do you need anything, Satellite? No, thanks! Don't stay here! All of you leave! I said leave. - Where's Pashow? - He went with Esmaeel. Satellite, Esmaeel sent this for you. How's your leg? What's up with the child? Don't touch it! It hurts. Thank God he is fine! I returned him healthy and well. - Did you see his sister? - No. But the armless boy sent a message for you. What did he say? Move away! He said everything would come to an end tomorrow morning. What? Everything will end by tomorrow. The war would end? I don't know. Everything ends tomorrow! Go and tell Esmaeel to inform the people that the war will end tomorrow! OK! Tell me what to say again! Go and tell Esmaeel to tell the people on the mosque microphone that the war will end tomorrow. Open the door! What is it? It's midnight. - Saddam has fallen. - What? I saw it myself. There are lots of Americans here. The refugees are coming back to the city. How did you find out? I saw it myself. All the children are on the hill. Why have they gone up there? When the Americans got here, they went to Esmaeel. They took his dish and carried it to the hill. The children are watching the prohibited channels with the American soldiers. They are watching the prohibited channels? Where is Shirkooh? He's going to the city with his uncle. Satellite, can we please go to the city? They say it is the end of the world. The city is chaos. Please, let's go! Everywhere is a mess. - Where were you? - Shirkooh has come. - Satellite! Are you better? - What is this? This is Saddam's arm. It's for you! They say it's very important. I sold all my mines to get it. The Americans said it's very expensive. - How did you learn their language? - You taught me! The Americans said not to collect American mines any more. Not any more. They will pay us money to collect these. They will pay dollars. Dollars! I have brought you something else. How nice and interesting!! - Well, what's going on? - I am coming. Guess what I have for you? What? A few red fish. What is this? Where did you get it? It's foreign. My uncle bought it from the Americans. - Let me see. - This is the red fish you wanted. - Where did you bring it from? - It's nice... It is first class American! Please, don't go into the water anymore! American... Are you making fun of me? I have to go now. My uncle is waiting for me. Coming Uncle! - Where are you going? - To the town. Take care! Come back soon! I am looking for a new job. I want to make some money! Goodbye! Why is the color like this? Don't look at them for too long! Sleep! - Why are they this color? - Goodbye! Shirkooh! Satellite said to come to the spring. He has seen something strange. Agrin! Agrin! Here, Satellite! The armless boy gave this to you. He said in 275 days something else will happen in the area. Look! Didn't you want to see the Americans? An Iran-Iraq joint product
