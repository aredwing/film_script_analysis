Nena you'll be sitting in a clinic ... HIV ... feeling stupid! " But not much more complicated when you talk ... ... on a long term relationship? - You and Trey still use condoms? We did the first five years but always did the test. And you know that we are to meet 11 years? Can you believe it? And I never cheated. That you know. What about you and Eddie? Still use condoms. I think it's more hygienic. Well, I think we can expect. Maybe we review the options after years of happy monogamy. There's that word again. Monogamy. With all types that are sexy ... ... Why do it? Well, not so much monogamy itself. Well ... Wade is the man ... sexiest on the planet. - For you. - Yes, for me. And I got it.

I know he has wood. Health, friends. - Health. - By Martha's Vineyard. - For the wedding. - For the wedding. So like effeminate, right? I mean ... ... Noah is not very masculine, no offense. And even the teacher's Counter a little loose ... ... when nobody is looking. There was nothing I sought, but when you fall in love, indeed. - Yes. - But did you ever think ... ... "if someone more masculine? " Sometimes. But femininity in a type is something funny. You get used to and you stop noticing it. Notes all things masculine. Muscles of the face angle. Then you must submit someone ... ... and during this horrible time back to see everything. Suddenly you're scared. You think: "Who am I? Do we really want this? " But it forces you to confront it. To be more courageous than you ever been if you had the easy option. I will ask another round. I hope you have not offended. Me like Mr. Nicholson. It's great. Only now I'm trying discovered homosexuality. And the kids my age are so impacts on different things. And if you walk around being sexist ... ... with my pants hanging from the rear ... - You're a real man. - Exactly. We all have to be 50 Cent ... ... or if Terrell Owens not fit that mold ... ... not even deserve to exist. You know something, man? It is. It takes a lot more value to be yourself as who you are ... ... is someone with whom many idiots ignorant have problems. But make no mistake. Noah? It is ten times more brave than I ever will be. But what about the thing upside down? Do not limit a bit? Like a parody of heterosexual relationships? - What do you mean? - Because I'm versatile, yes? Did you ever want Mr. Nicholson fuck you? Who says you he have not already done? Hey. Baby, you're drunk, baby. - It's not fair. - What? I do not care the family of Wade. Yes, but what you do about it? He forgot the phone. Is it prudent? I know he would love that his family was here. What time is it? Hello? "Mrs. Robinson? "Wade? I'm actually Noah. But flames my son's phone. Is something wrong? Did something happen? No, no, no. Everything is fine. It's just that ... This is the wedding. What wedding? Wade's wedding. What are you talking? Who speaks and how do you know my son?

I like to stay. Surprise! Are we going to invite to happen? Of course. - Curtis! - Your old man is not, right? The last chance to make the wild. That is what the bachelor party. Get away from me. The party was fabulous. Baby Gat talked and talked on your scripts. And Diddy is looking for a vehicle new to his acting career. "I Am Legend" finds its "In Pursuit of Happiness." Where is the toilet? - Down on ... - Got it! Coked. Beautiful house. I wear clothes. It does not bother me. My God, boys ... ... They are Brandy and Baby Gat. What do I do? Want my advice? Probably not, but in these circumstances themselves. Sleep with Baby Gat ... ... but I know what the British call "bad in bed". So lose interest. Without principles, but psychologically effective. I sleep with Baby Gat. A useful suggestion, please? Offer him a drink. Great! You Keep them busy here ... ... while I clear my mind and Wade will tell how ... ... I just tell his mother he's gay. And I wear clothes. I wear clothes. Ricky is in love with Noah. So nobody is attracted. It is not against marriage. It is against Noah to marry someone other than him. That makes sense, really.
