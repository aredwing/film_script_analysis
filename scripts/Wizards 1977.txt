It took two million years... for some of the radioactive clouds to allow some sun in. By then, only a handful of humans survived. The rest of humanity had changed into hideous mutants. These mutant species floundered in the bad areas... radioactive lands that never allowed them to become human again... and made each birth a new disaster. Then, in the good lands... they came back, arising from their long sleep... fairies, elves, dwarves-- the true ancestors of man. They lived happily in the good areas. It was a big day in Montagar. Delia, queen of the fairies... was presiding over the feast of plenty... celebrating 3,000 years of peace. In the midst of the celebration... Delia felt a pull from the skies. She looked up and saw dark clouds... forming on the horizon in every direction. She fell into a trance and left the party... heading for her home on a high hill. At first, the fairies were puzzled. But then they too felt a force drawing them to follow. Delia was alone inside. The storm grew until it was a raging cyclone... hovering over the dwelling. One of the older fairies ventured inside the house. There lay Delia on her bed... holding a pair of twins in her arms. The older fairy instantly knew that... these were not ordinary twins, but magical wizards. The baby wizards were polarized like magnets... one attracting with a magnetic draw... the other repelling and impossible to get near. A vatar, the kind and good wizard... spent much of his boyhood... entertaining his mother with beautiful visions. Blackwolf, the mutant wizard... would never visit his mother... and spent his time torturing small animals. More years passed, and Delia continued to slip. Finally, all life drained out of her... andA vatar held her hand trying desperately to use his magic to restore her. He cradled her in his arms and wept. when Blackwolffound that his mother had died, he was excited... for now he felt he would take over her leadership and rule the land. when A vatar confronted Blackwolf, he was enraged. They began a furious battle. Each using his magic, they continued... until they had nearly destroyed each other. But A vatar's magic was stronger... because he had the emotional loss of his mother that drove him on. Blackwolfwas defeated. "The day will come, my brother, when I will return... and make this a planet where mutants rule. " Blackwolfheaded off, leaving A vatar very disturbed. The ti me has come. Ki I l! [ Laughi ng ] wel l, hello, handsome. - [ Boing-ing ] - Hello, honey. He is called Necron 99. He is one of Blackwolf's assassins. He travels the land destroying the believers of magic. [ Chains Clinking ] [ Horse Neighing ] [ Man Reading ] "My children, the only true technology is nature. "All the other forms of manmade technology... "are perversions. "The ancient dictators used technology... to enslave the masses." - [ Gunshot ] - [ Birds Squawking ] [Door Opens ] [ Sniffing Air] [ Chittering ] - weehawk, can't we stay here for tonight?. - No. Just for a few hours' rest. - I sense something. - But the road is clear. we haven't seen an assassin for days. A clever assassin stays hidden. Avatar must be warned. Our mission is nearly over, westwind... but now it's time for one final run.

And ifthey don't show... you'll know no more than you did before. - [ Giggling ] - How true, fairy goddess of the New world... but ifthey don't show... I think that will tell us something too. Damn it, Avatar! Ifthere's any danger... maybe we should-- maybe we should arm our states. - Science and technology?. - There's no time for that. Even ifwe could impress our people with the danger... science and technologywere outlawed... millions of years ago... and, we must admit... it's been a peaceful world since then. Enough, wizard! I demand to know whatyou know... - orI'll banishyou! - [ Growling ] [ Giggling ] Banish him?. But, Father, who will teach me... all the magic I've left to learn?. Only Avatar can make me... a full-fledged fairy. As you can see, I'm only halfthere. Allright. All right. - ?? [ Music Plays ] - I'll tell you... ifyou thinkyou can handle it. what doyou know about war, about bombs... that could turn a planet molten and liquid? To think it could start again... ten million years after the final one. Sometimes I get tired of being so old. Sometimes... being a wizard is lonely at the top. we're waiting, old, old wizard. [ Giggles ] You know about my brother. well, as theyears passed... I searched for my brother in vain. He had settled in the dark land of Scortch... where people still died of radiation. [Narrator] For5,000years, Blackwolfstudied black arts... increasing his wisdom 1 0,000-fold. He built a small following of frog-like creatures... but needed more troops for his evil plans. He then formed an army whose generals were called up... from the black shadows of hell. Souls who waited for untold eternities for a new leader... Blackwolf's tremendous power... enslaved them all to carry out his will. Then stories of Blackwolf's armies... attacking neighboring countries came back. Demons of hell armed with black magic... but they would get bored... or sidetracked in the middle of battle... and give up, running home. Fritz! Fritz, get up, for God's sake! Get up! They've killed Fritz! They've killed Fritz! Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies! Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin! Those despicable, animal warmongers! They've killed Fritz! Take that! Take this! Take that, you green slime! - You black-hearted, short bow-legged-- - Max! Max, I'm okay! I'm okay, Max. Just a scratch. - Look, I'm all right. - Oh. Oh, damn. Thereyou go again stepping on my lines... raining on my parade, costing me medals. - Oh, damn! - [ Groans ] Ohh. Oh, Fritz?. Fritz, get up, for God's sake! Get up! They've killed Fritz! They've killed Fritz! Those lousy, stinking, yellow fairies! Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin! Take this! Take that! They killed Fritz! [Narrator] Theycouldeasilyhave won, but theylacked... the motivation and inspiration. Blackwolfknew he needed more. He sent his huge armies out to excavate ancient ruins... for links to the past. Tales reachedA vatar that bits and pieces of pre-holocaust technology... were being dug up and marched back to Scortch I. with these ancient pieces... he built a new war machine. Still, his generals needed more to fight with. This drove Blackwolfmad with frustration. Then one day, that frustration vanished. I sent my elf spies to fi nd out what was happeni ng. I 'm sure he has found some great power... that will control his armies. You mean you sent out that elf envoy... to investigate based on a vague feeling of your-- [ Enraged Screams ] [ Screaming Continues ] I've failed you, mywizard. I've failed you, my president.

It's not important! The main exterminations are complete. The remaining countries are nowruled... bysecond-rate incompetents... so confused... that even now they blame the killings... on those within their own ranks. I t's ti me to stri ke! Sieg heil.

Traitor?. You fools, release me. Stay back! As the king's guards... we can't allowyou near until the king has ruled. [ Laughs ] No one rules over Elinore of Montagar.

The only one who could might be the king here. My mission, O Lord, is to save the world from another holocaust. Sean was killednot byus, but bymybrother's assassins... who have been sent to kill weehawk, Elinore... Peace, and myself before we reach Scortch. For al I I know and fear, weehawk is dead. So m ight be Peace. I ask for permission to take the girl and myself... to try to complete our mission alone... though it does seem doomednow. I will not allow you to hurt Elinore... without a fight by myself. My brother lies, my good King! Avatar! Avatar! [ Screams ] what will it be, King?. Time's gettingshort. - Avatar, could you hurry up a little bit?. - [ Roaring ] we have been sent death... images and humans... each with a different story. Something happening here. Notyou, please. Oh, no. [ Laughs ] I have always been very good... and could even be better sometimes. Itstarts again. The only act that has been real so far... is the fact that Avatar did not break his word. when the arrow struck him, he did not fight back. Andfrom what we all heard aboutAvatar's power... - that is surelythe sign of truth. - [ Roaring ] we will neither join nor hinder nor help these two. we will wait and see. That is our decision. [ Bellows ] well, we're out of there. Ouch! Thanks. I forgot about that. - Let me helpyou. - No, no, no, no. Let me helpyou. How's that?. It's very pretty, Avatar. Yeah, well, it could be warmer. we might as well begin. This is the way, I think. Scortch lies somewhere over these mountains. [Avatar] well, goodmorning. Cozymorning, huh? Avatar, we're trapped. It's nothing a little hard work won't cure. Here. Follow me, Snow Queen. [ Elinore ] I 'm so cold, so cold. Is it much farther?. Elinore, we've rested long enough. we'd better move on. Just a little while longer, Avatar. I'm so tired. well, okay. I'll go over and see ifl can see a pass or a path or a-- or a house or... something. Oh, my God. They're our own tracks. we've been moving in circles. I better not tell Elinore. - [Hoofbeats ] - It'll do her no good. Avatar, riders! Run! Assassins come to finish the job! we'll cut their throats. Let them come. - Right. I'll zap them back to Scortch. - [Hoofbeats Approaching] - [Horse Neighing] - They split up. Going to come at us from each end. - Avatar, we really tried, didn't we?. - Yes, Elinore. That's all anyone really could have done. Steady. Here they come. Braxis plaxis traxis! Montagar forever. Death, assassins! Peace! Peace, we found them! we found them! what tookyou so long?. Quickly, Peace. Quickly. Let's get them off this glacier. The quest is saved. [Narrator] The night was spent in the protection of a cave. Elinore and weehawk slept as Avatar counseled with Peace... on the quickest route to Scortch. The journey took them past the ruins... of ancient civilizations. Strange beasts lurked about... but the dangerous mutants that lived there were gone... gone to Blackwolf's army. All they left were their wives, hurling insults and rocks... as the party passed through. Then finally, the desert.
