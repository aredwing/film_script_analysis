Let's go to work. Pritchard. how are we doing with our development in Brazil? Mr. Bolt. we just Learned... that in order to build Club Bolt the way you envision it... we'd be forced to cut down six thousand acres... of natural Brazilian rain forest. So? Well. sir. the Last four hundred remaining Ipi Indians... Left in the world are still Living there. So? Sir. if we cut down their forest... we'd have to displace them. and they could cause trouble. Well. they're not gonna want to Live there anymore anyway. -Why not? -No shade. How are we doing with our new development in Florida? Sir. we are having a slight problem in Fort Lauderdale. In order to make room for the magnificent... Largest-in-the-world Bolt shopping mail... we're going to have to tear down a nursing home for the aged. So? Well. at present. there are 1 8O very old people Living there... and we understand that most of them are invalids... who are bedridden and dying. So? It wouldn't Look good in the papers. Ah. I get your point. Do it late at night. Excellent! Gentlemen. I have a Little surprise. Follow me. -What is this? -Looks Like a slum area. You are Looking at 2.5 square miles... of the most derelict. dilapidated section... of Los Angeles. Right now. I own half of this property. The city owns the other half. but by noon tomorrow... it will all be mine. Ow! What is that? One of those Little bums that Live down there. I suppose you're wondering why Goddard Bolt... is prepared to pay 11p to $4 biulon... to own this worthless pile of refuse. Am I right? Well. we would never presume to question your genius... for financial wizardry. sir. but why? Wait. Gentlemen. the ultimate achievement of my life-- Bolt Center. It's absolutely visionary. -Fantastic! -Incredible! Gentlemen. you'll never know... how mllch this project excites me. Mr. Bolt. you have a surprise visitor. -Who is it? -Vance CrassWell. sir. CrassWell? Damn it! Thank you. Let's go. Excuse me. Am I interrupting? I'm interrupting. I'm interrupting. I should Ieave. Should I Ieave? I'm gonna Ieave. Can I come in? Hello. Vance. You know my attorneys-- Pritchard. KnowIes. Stevens. The three wise men. Hiya. feIIas. What's going on? Oh. my God! Oh. my God! Someone eIse's idea of what to do... with the downtown slum district. Would you beI-- Why didn't they teII me Goddard Bolt owned the other half? I never would have bought it. No one beats Goddard Bolt... when it comes to financiaI wheeIing and deaIing. Now. Look. I'm in way over my head here. I'm sorry to have wasted your time. Gentlemen. Mr. Bolt... Can I ask you a question? Let me buy your half of the property. I'll give you $2 biIIion... 4o/o of the profit for the next twenty years. -No. -5o/o. -No. -Six. -Stop. -Stopped. Vance. why don't you Iet me buy you out? Look at us. An office is no pIace to do business. I have a much better idea. Now. isn't this better? At Ieast we can see what we're deaIing with. OK. finaI offer. I want this property. I want it. It just so happens... I grew up five bIocks from where we're standing. I'm all right. Right in the middIe of this godforsaken slum. It's been my IifeIong dream to come back and rebuild it. It's OK. You can Iaugh. I don't expect you to understand my feeIings. After aII. you're a rich man's son. You were born into money. What. are you kidding? My father Left me five million. It's nothing. No. no. no. Nothing is nothing! These people down here have nothing. Zero! Look. I don't want to hurt your feelings. You couldn't survive ten minutes down here. Don't be ridiculous. I would survive anywhere. Right. Without your money and your credit cards? Yes. Without identifying yourself to anyone as Goddard Bolt? Yes. For a modest period of time-- I don't know. Let's say. thirty days? Absolutely. It's a bet. Bet? What are you talking about? Well. what you just said--that you could survive down here... without using any of your resources for 3O days. If you do it. you get my half of the property. You don't do it. I'm gonna get yours. I'm sorry. Wasn't that the bet? You conniving son of a bitch. Yes! It's a bet. You've underestimated me. Vance. I can do it. You can't do it! You'll never make it! This is insane. This is crazy. You'll never survive. Pritchard. be qulet. Fergueson. go on. Thank you. If you Ieave the prescribed slum area... or try to remove this ankIe aIarm. it will go off... and if we receive a sustained aIarm signal... for more than thirty seconds. you'll forfeit the bet. After thirty days. the aIarm will automatically deactivate. Are these conditions understood? Understood. -And we have your word on that? -Yes. You have my word on it. Pritchard. I'm giving you and your partners... my power of attorney. I'm trusting you to Look after all my IegaI affairs... for the next thirty days. Take it. Take it aII. I won't need anything. And you won't need this either. What are you doing? I have to make sure no one recognizes you. That was stitched in. Give me a comb. I don't think you realize what you're getting into. You've never sIept in the street before. You've never eaten out of garbage cans. You're used to a hearty breakfast. This is ludicrous. Look at you without your toupee. You Look Like somebody who onIy makes $5O.000 a year. Mr. Bolt. Please don't do this. Let me suggest you wait twenty-four hours. -At Ieast sIeep on it. -I've given my word. Do you want me to go back on my word? -Would you go back on your word? -CertainIy. We're Iawyers. Give me that contract. OK. Goddard. here we are. Come on. Now. in thirty days. at the exact moment of sunset... all of this property is gonna be yours or mine. Either way.

Nice to see you. -I just gave you a handkerchief. -Yeah. but it's got initiaIs. You can't bIow snot in initiaIs. -See you. -Yeah. See you. Excuse me.

Shut up! I didn't say that much. Take it easy. Can you beIieve that in the middIe of all this fiIth... two Lost souls could find some smail shred of happiness? Happiness? What a crock. See you after the honeymoon. Lady! You got a job. you keep it! Don't make my mistake. You had a job? A job? I had a career. I was a dancer. and a good one... before I gave it up when I got married! You were married? Oh. you bet I was married. I was married to Tom-- Tom Terrific. Sure. Tom. Anything you want. Tom. You want it now. Tom? Oh. sure. Tom. Go ahead. Tom. What? Finished aIready. Tom? No. I don't mind. Tom. Where you going. Tom? You wash up. Tom. I'll finish by myseIf. Tom! Where did you go. Tom? You didn't Ieave a note. Tom. I'm all aIone here. Tom. You Left me all the biIIs. Tom. They're taking away the house. Tom. I don't have a job. Tom! I'm in a Iot of trouble. So. after Tom ran out... I realized I had to adjust my entire IifestyIe. I created this whoIe new mentaI attitude. It's called a nervous breakdown. I cried a Iot. I screamed a Iot. I was hystericaI morning. noon. and night. I was Like this-- HeIp me! Somebody heIp me! Get the picture? I got it. Yes. I got it. I think the whoIe bIock got it. So. I've been in this nervous breakdown... for about eight years. And you know something? I Like it. I waIk when I want. I sit down when I want... I cry when I want. I Iaugh when I want. I pick my own hours. Sounds a Little... Crazy? There's nothing wrong with crazy. Crazy's good. Crazy keeps them away. So what's your story? You ever been married? Yes. I tried it once. Didn't work out. She said I spent all my time making money. That was time Well spent. Wet it down. ALL over. ALL over.

What was that all about? Hey. it's my pIace! My stuff! Shall I call the fire department? No. It's just a bunch of junk. I'm gonna get those bastards. Come over here. I want you to get Mean Victor and Yo... and get them to chase you down here to this Chinese restaurant. -Me? -Yes. Then I want you to run through this door... and Iock it behind you. Now. if you Iock it. you're safe. We'll do the rest. Can you do this? May I propose an aIternative? -What? -Why don't we sue? You may be the weak Iink in this. You know what to do when you get to the kitchen. Weak Iink. I'm addressing the two degenerates... who call themseIves Victor and Yo. You rob and expIoit the heIpIess for your own profit and gain... and use the spoiIs of your activities... to buy and seII iIIegaI narcotics. Therefore. I am making a citizen's arrest. Citizen's arrest. And you won't be needing this anymore. Get him! Get him! You have the right to remain siIent. Anything you say can and will be used... against you in a court of Iaw. God damn it! Thank God! Wait a minute. Don't pour! Wait till they're right under us. ALL right. I admit it. I have a very weak case. You'll be happy to know I'm dropping the charges. Oh. shit! I'm out of bounds. -What's that noise? -I don't know. It stopped. What's he doing? He's coming back again? He's the bravest man I've ever seen. I'm not mad. I just want to put my foot up here. Yeah. that's good. That's good. Pepto. get out of the way! Now! Oh. it's hot! They won't come around here anymore. I hope so. Jeez. they realIy did a job on you. Man. you throw a mean face. Well. according to this. his ankIe aIarm went off... at 3:35 for 28 1 /2 seconds. Well. Let's just say 3O seconds. Then we'd win. But his Iawyers get a copy of the same readout. sir. Does anybody know why he stepped out of bounds... for 28 1 /2 seconds? Well. our surveiIIance teII us that he was attacked... by some vicious dereIicts. sir... and. I might add. was severeIy beaten. -He aImost. uh-- -He aImost what? Died. My God! Died? I don't want to be responsibIe for his death. You think there's any chance that could happen? Well. it is possibIe. He is Living in the streets. and there's so much danger... down there. you never know what could happen. We'll keep you posted. Mr. CrassWell. Yes. thank you. Die. I never thought he could actuaIIy die. That would be so tragic. There. This will heIp. What is that? It's some stuff Fumes drinks. It'll kiII anything except Fumes. He's germ-proof. Germs wouldn't Live in him. I'm being invaded by one. Dead germ. Looks Like it's going to rain. I don't Like the rain. We can sIeep in this box. Do you got a pIace to sIeep? No. As a matter of fact. we don't. There's boxes over there. Come on. Let's get 'em one. Here's a good one. Now. this is my side. this is your side... and this is a World War II army-navy surplus store bayonet. This will remind us of our bollndaries. OK?

I've heard those same fancy words... from other gllys just before they jllmp you. Good night. Look. I don't mean to be harsh. It's just that you're a man... and men are no good. -I can do it. -Do what? Oh. nothing. Nothing. Good night. Good night. It's raining. I Iove the rain. It washes all the fiIth out of the city. Speaking of fiIth... where would Goddard Bolt go on a night Like this? Well. if it were very bad. he'd go to the mission... with the other dereIicts. It's a shame-- it's a rotten shame-- that these people have to Live Like this... aIways on the edge of llncertainty. Any chance of getting that mission cIosed tonight? -Very good idea. sir. -Thank you. It's coming down harder. What the heck's going on? We're getting fIooded out. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Oh. man! Look out. SaiIor. Well. there goes the neighborhood. Oh. this is bad. The rain aIways kicks up my collgh. We'd better get to the mission. Look out. Open the door. Open up in there! We're getting wet!

You call this an ocean? Well. sooner or Later. it all goes to the ocean. Why are we doing this? We're doing this because SaiIor wanted his ashes... sprinkIed in the old Briny. He's so Light. -How mllch did he weigh? -1 3O. maybe 1 4O pollnds. Must have been mostIy moistllre. Is that the best you could do? A shoe box? We're Lucky to get it. Let's face it-- they pllt the rich in an llrn. and they pllt the poor in a cardboard box. Like takeout. Well. go ahead. Oh. man. here. You do it. You talk the best. SaiIor. wherever you are...

Because we all know that your cIient... onIy has two days to go to win the bet. Looks Like he's going to win it. Therefore. I have no bllsiness... even being here. do I? I'm just gonna pllt it simpIy. Gentlemen. Would you consider... betraying the man for whom You've worked ten years... in exchange for-- how do you say this-- just a shitIoad of money? I made it.

Where else but in America... could a poor. deprived boy from this very same neighborhood... return one day to destroy it? It's good to be alive! There are so many things you can't do when you're dead. -Remember what you said? -What? What you said in the hospital. What? That you love me. It's words. just words. ''Love'' is just another word. You meant it. Let the demolition begin. -Nunzio! -Yo! And now. ladies and Gentlemen. to celebrate and cut the dust... I salute you with the finest champagne money can buy. What's that? Oh. man!
