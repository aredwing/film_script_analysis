The "Metal Lady", as I came to call her, Never did anything frightening in those dreams, She just stood there on a shelf; Quiet, watching me. And I was terrified because, in those moments, I felt everything that was to come. One day the dreams stopped And I never saw the Metal Lady again. But I never forgot her. A day doesn't go by when she doesn't enter my thoughts In one way or another. Not one day. Okay. I'll go. Wait. Donald. So are you saying Thomas won't pay now? No, Albert, just between you and me. I won't visit him or anything. Right. Mm-hm. Call him. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Call me back. Hey, Tai. How are things? You know. So... Speak. He won't pay? No, I understand. We're all friends. Actor? No wonder he's poor. Right? I gotta go, Albert. No, we're cool. Late. So... I just wanted to get another round For the four of us. Usual? Yeah, that's good. "Fun pack" for David. Hundred fifty. Here's the thing. I... we... were kind of hoping for a favor. If you wanted a favor, you should have sent Kari. I know. Where is she? She... she has... herpes. Herpes? Yeah... huge... blisters. When did she...? Oh, after that, this was, you know, recent, This morning, like, she woke up and just, blam, you know? I wouldn't, I'm sure you're past that window, no doubt. Okay. This would be an actual favor not a trade And then we could get the money to you... This isn't Hurricane relief, David. That line never gets old to him. No, I know this isn't, I just thought... And we've been so good about... Yeah, okay. Come back when you've got the money. Right. Sorry for bugging you. Went to rehab together, David. You don't need to apologize to me. In fact, I'm wondering When you're going to come work for me. I did ask you a few months ago. You did. Wouldn't have these problems. I know that, and I appreciate it, I do. I just... Need to think about things some more is all. Phones. Is it the "dead parents" thing? No. No, it's not that. You can tell me. I'm sensitive, I can be sensitive. No, it's, I just need more time. Herpes, huh? Looks real painful. You're not buying crank downtown, are you, David? No way, I like my car just the way it is. Can't trust those people. They're not like you and me. I know, I don't. Even the cops, they go down there, are wild cards. That cowboy act last month? Gunned down those bank robbers Even the ones who were trying to give up. Even killed a little kid. Can't trust anything down there. Don't make that mistake. I know and I won't. I have no idea how she got it, Tai. Really. She still seeing that guy, Splat? Spot. Spot. Maybe it was him. Probably. He's a jerk. I don't even know why I still hang out with him. Loyalty's key, David. Without loyalty, you're a target. Tell you what. I have to run some errands. But it's my Mom's birthday today... Oh, happy birthday. She thanks you. I want to get her a television. A television? A nice one. I'm going to be here until eleven Then I'm out for the weekend. See what you can do and we'll talk. A television, sure. This is my cell for today. When you have something, call. I'm doing this because it's you. Because we have history. I know. When you come back, I'm going to want an answer About the other thing, as well. Call when you gots. Thanks, Tai. What are friends for? I don't know. Yeah. Well? He wants a television. I knew we should have sent Kari. Shut up. Did he ask for me? What do you think? What did you tell him? I told him you had herpes. What? Did you... David, did you really say that? I had to say something. It's okay. No it's not. Herpes. Did he ask about me? No. That's funny. It's not funny. It's kind of funny. Shut up! Stop hitting my car, Spot! Kari, admit it, it's funny. Maybe a little. Kari! See? I don't care! These are issues. You don't make fun of issues. Whose issues are they? They're mine. They should be yours, too. I don't know why you're so mad, Spot. You're the one who sent her into Tai's in the first place. Mother Fff... ahhh! Whoa! You're so mad! You're dead! We need a television. Who do we know who has a real nice television? Cee Cee's Video has good stuff. I saw the commercial yesterday. What are we doing here? These people just moved in. How do you know that? I was driving past last week on my way to see Amy And I saw the Ryder truck out front. I thought you hadn't seen her since the funeral. How is Amy? When I got there it was just her lawyer with some paper work, so I don't know how's she doing. I like your sister. Me too. Yeah. Why this place? Because it's too soon for them to have hooked up An alarm system. They're still dealing with boxes, organizing. Unpacking, all that stuff. Smart. I say we hit downtown. We'd stick out like sore thumbs down there. Listen, we don't even know they have a television. Have you ever met someone who didn't have a television? Amish people don't have television. What? You're so stupid. They weren't Amish, Donald. Nobody around here is Amish. How do you even know Amish people don't have television? I saw it on television. Oh, you saw it on television that the Amish people Don't have television? Do you even know how much of a retard you sound like? No. Leave him alone. She's right, quit it. You. Don't you even... This will do. Why are you making decisions around here, anyway? What, you think just 'cause you have a car makes you boss? Works for me. Me too. I'm not the boss. That's right, you're not. And I could have a car, too, just so everyone knows. You're not the only one who could be driving people around. I just think this is the perfect choice. - So do I. - Me too. Oh, well, if it's so perfect, what's the plan to get in there? - Stupid! - Shhh. It's daylight, man. Nice yard. Listen, we should wait until it gets dark. They'll be back by then. Big for this neighborhood. And Tai is heading out for the weekend tonight. So it's gotta be now. You think they'll get a pool? Donald. Hope they don't have dogs. Oh, right. What's your plan now, master thief? I don't see any doggie toys. No doggie door. That's good. What are you two talking about? Nothing. Woof. Stupid. Here we go. You should break the little horn while you're at it. Well just pop the glass! No. Look, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, David, But when you're through wasting all of our time, I think we should just get back... Shut up. I'm cool. No alarms. Everyone look around. Quietly. I need a car. Nice. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Where's Donald? Don't care. Take this to the car. I'll find him. Let's go. Television. We got a flat screen. That one's junk. Some people don't like flat screens. Gives them a headache. This might be good to have as a back up. Does it work? Ummmmm... Just see if it works. If it does, pick it up and meet us at the car. Can you carry it by yourself? - Yeah, I got it. - Alright. I'm gonna go make sure Spot didn't run off With that flat screen. David? What? Sorry about your parents. I don't think I ever said that to you. Yeah. Everything happened so fast with the accident, then the funeral. Sorry. Thanks. Hurry up. I will. Snow. I wasn't going to run off with it. Right. I was just going to find an alternate route in case Something went down. Uh-huh. I'm not a thief, David. Tell him, Kari. Where's Donald? He's bringing another television. You need a Plan B. That's all I was thinking. Plan B. Speak. It's me. David. Already? How do you feel about flat screens? Flat screens? Yeah, I've got one in the back seat right now. Flat screens are fine. Doesn't give you a headache? Only thing that gives me a headache Is people who owe me money. Uhh... okay, We'll bring the flat screen by, then. Yeah, in the middle at the moment. Call me when you're ready to hook up. Okay. Late. We're all set. Yeah, daddy's little girl. You're a good little girl aren't you? Mmmm, yeah. Oh yeah, that's good. Oh yeah. Suck it. Now lift the camera. - Let's just go. - Spot. We're not leaving him. We can't wait here all day. You even said yourself they'll be home soon. And your car doesn't exactly match the drapes. At least I have a car. I could get a car. You like it. Donald, we have to... I knew you liked that. So good, honey. Oh, so good. Suck it. Now lift the camera. I'm going to see what's going on. Oh no you're not. You stay right where you are, stay right where you are! Stupid! Hello? What, what is taking so long? Woah! There's a whole box of these. There's-there's women with boys and girls, There's men with boys and girls. Look, everything's labeled. Labels, ooh, let's go. - No, we can't. - Excuse me? It's not our business, Donald. The guy who lives here is a pedophile, David. And we're drug-addict burglars. Six of one, half a dozen of the other. Let's go. David's right, we can't stay here. What about me? I'm right, too. We can't just leave. I'm sorry, was I napping when you became a superhero? We'll leave an anonymous tip for the police. They won't care. They'll care, it's their job. Yeah, just like it's our job to steal NAMBLA's flat screen. Spot. Serious, he diddles himself to people diddling children; We steal his television. Hurray, the criminal food chain is intact. Shut up. What did you say to me? Shut up! Get your hands off me! You know I have a thing about that. Both of you stop! Nobody cares about this stuff. - Of course we care. - No. It's a crime of the week, and then it's nothing. Alright, I've had enough of this. Get your rank, stupid self... Let go of my hand! Don't you put me down! You're not going to put me down in that place! Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Yes, I hear you! Donald, let him go! Promise me, David. Promise me we just won't blow this off. I promise. Just let him go so that we can get out of here. He's got a daughter, David. Her pictures are all over the house. I know. I saw. What do you think he does to her? Who cares? I care! My wrist! We can't do anything right now. Promise we'll do something if the cops don't. I promise. Swear it! On your parents! I swear to you on my parents, If the cops don't do anything, we will. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. I could get Carpal's Tunnel from this. Let's just go. Donald, no! Donald, no! Donald! You like taking them? Do you? Well, how's this? How's this? How's this, how's this, how's this, how's this, How's this? I'm out of here. No, you're not. You can't just keep us here. I can and I will. But... that's not fair. We can't stay here, Donald. What's staying here going to solve? - I don't know. - News flash. If you're going to drag us all into your psycho crusade, Maybe you should know. Stop pressing me! We can call the police. He won't go to jail. - Not for long. - You don't know that. I do, they'll put him in jail and they think that everybody's Safe but you can't cure these people. Donald... Why do you think they have to register on the Internet? It's so everybody knows the cops can't handle it And that people have to handle it themselves. And half the time they don't even register. We have to calm down here... They'll let him out. They'll let him out and he'll do it again. - You don't know that, Donald. - I do. They'll let him out until he does something Enough for them to understand enough to keep him in jail... But by then... by then... - If we leave now... - Donald... He'll just go free! You don't know that. This happened to me! It happened to me. Donald. Oh, God. God can't see you. This is bad. You think? Please, take anything you want... Anything? How about the DVDs, can I take them? The ones with little boys and girls. That's all the look I needed. No, I can explain... You like sucking things, don't you? Smaller the better, yeah? We can destroy them. We're going to turn them in to the cops Is what we're going to do. No, please. Don't do that! Okay, he's scared, Donald. We're gonna report him. What's this "we?" Spot. I'm not doing anything. We're calling the police. Please don't do that! I have a family, a little girl. That's right. You do have a little girl. I saw the pictures. None of this has to leave this house. She's about the same age as those kids In those little movies of yours. Are you grooming her for something special? You don't understand... Does she have something you're gonna want to suck on soon? Why wait? I can give you something to suck on right now. Donald, we're leaving. This looks about right. Donald, no! Suck on this! Help me! Spot! Help us, man! Get off of me! I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. We're here for you. We're not going anywhere. We're right here. One sec. One sec? It's okay, Donald. I know. I know it's going to be okay. Tai. I expected your call a while ago. Bit tied up here. You guys must be really jonesin' by now. A little. What's that noise? Uh... Spot got in a fight with Donald. Is that crying? Crying? Sounds like crying. Donald hit him pretty hard. What a puss. Total puss, right? Listen, call me when you've got Everyone's feelings smoothed out. I will. Oh, and David? I've been thinking. I'm doing you and your friends a real big favor. I think you owe me a trial run. Uh, well... Welcome to the team, buddy. Call me when you're close. Tai? Tai? David... David... I know. Let's get out of here. Why did you tell Tai I was crying? I had to tell him something. I wasn't crying. Oh, for God's sake. No, you said I was a puss. I'm not a puss. Did Tai say I was a puss? I don't feel good... He's the puss. Not me. - I want to go home. - Okay. Let's go home. That's so wrong. I got 'em. No! Who's the puss, now? What are you doing? I'm taking charge. Someone has to. Don't touch her! Kari, give me a hand. It's okay, nobody's going to hurt you anymore. My eye, man! - Leave her alone! - Shut up! You knew what he was watching! You saw those DVDs and you did nothing! - Let me go! - It's okay! You're safe now! Okay, she's tied and gagged. We should tie up the little girl and go. No. You just said you wanted to go home. That was before I saw her. Saw who? Now what? The little girl. I can't leave her. - Maybe you can adopt. - Spot! Serious, I think all the psycho drug addicts are doing that now. You don't scare me. Spot, your eye. Oh, really? Get him some ice. He can get his own ice. Get him some ice. Get her some ice, too. We have to tie her up. Absolutely not. She's been through enough already. Donald, listen to me, you're not thinking clearly here. We're not tying her up. We can't keep her loose. There's no controlling her. I said no. Look, I know you're upset. I know you're trying to do what's best for this girl. But you don't know these people, Donald. We don't know anything about them. We don't know this man, we don't know this woman And we definitely don't know this little girl. Which means they all have to be tied up. No. Donald, be reasonable. No one touches her. She's been through enough. You have one new message. That's none of your business. Here, hold this to your eye. Or not. - Babe... - No. Look, I know we're having issues right now... We don't have anything anymore. I'm a jerk, fine, and I admit I'm not always the first to come up with a good idea. But it doesn't take a nice, smart guy, It doesn't take David to know this is going to end badly. Let go of me. Listen, we can go out that back door. We can get the television out the backseat and go see Tai. You want to still hate me after that, fine. But at least we'll be away from here and away from Donald, Away from what is, I guarantee, Going to turn into the worst day of our lives if we stay. I'm taking this to the woman you punched. You do whatever you want. Stupid. Central. I have a car parked without a permit. Over. Uh, hey, Ross. Just make sure it's not a resident's car. We don't want a problem like last time. Donald, no matter what you're feeling, No matter what you're going through... He has to die. It's okay. It's okay, I won't hurt you. Here, this should help. Thank you. What? Thank you. You're welcome. She's a beautiful girl. What's her name? Mia. Her name is Mia. Mia, that's a pretty name. What's your name? Kari. Kari's a pretty name, too. Oh, thank you. What is her gag doing off? She's fine. I'm Jennifer. What's your name? Irrelevant. Keep an eye on the brat. No, no, no, Donald... Listen to me, this is the only way to protect her. Now I can't make you feel good About doing the right thing here. You'll have to deal with that on your own. Deal with what? Nothing. He needs to know. Know what? Donald wants to kill that guy. - You are crazy. - It's still going to happen. You want to go down for this guy, that's on you. I'm out. No you're not. Watch me. Oh, and this, this is for my eye. You want some, too? Keys. Give me the keys or I start hurting everyone. Last chance. Enjoy the ride down. Help! Okay, okay. I think we're okay. No. No. You're dead! Get off of me! Get off! Get your hands off of me! I'll kill you, I'll kill you! No. That's it, that's it, it's over. Listen... They have the car. The television. There's a way around this. Eventually, they'll put it together and we're done, I'm done. Look at me! When we all first met, I should have made a different choice. Kari, this... Listen, I know, there's never a good time To say something like this, But we still have choices, you and I. There's still time. How do we get past Donald? Last words? Don't do this. Noted. Where's the knife? Where is it? You can't do this, Donald. It has to be done. What about her? Her's who I'm doing it for. You're going to kill this guy in front of his daughter? You'll be traumatizing her for life. He's right, Donald. Think. I'll take him to the basement. No! Help me with this. Please! What's wrong? I'm sorry. What? Hey! Get me out of here! There's no lock. I need a hand. Hurry! David! Open this door! David! Act normal. Okay. We have to find out where the car is. No, we have to report it stolen. They'll connect it to the house. Right, you're right. We'll report it stolen. Where do we go first? My place? Okay. Maybe we can get another television And then we can go see Tai. What, what's the matter? Can we just leave Spot? I can. I can, too. That's not... But, if Donald gets out of the basement... If he kills that guy, Spot's... We'll make it fast. And then he can go his own way. Just you and me. Just you and me. David? Untie me. Hold on. David. Hurry up, man. David! David. Kari. Look, Donald... I'm looking, David. I see. Where's the girl? The girl? It's the craziest thing. I got locked in the basement, And when I got out she was gone. Imagine that. There's no reason to... To what? Get mad? I'm past mad. We were just going to get the car. Oh? Get the car, come back pick us all up. Was that it? Something like that, more or less! Hello? Mia. Seven. Uh-huh. Um-hm, yes. Okay. Okay. It's for you. Hello? This is Lieutenant Charles Tarelli. Am I speaking to the person in charge? They want to talk to you. Hello? Is this the person in charge? You told them I was in charge? Oh. Hello? Hello? Yes. Are you in charge? Yes. Didn't I speak with you first? You did. Why are you telling me someone else is in charge When it's you I'm supposed to be talking to? Normally David's in charge. He has the car. He drove us here, and that was his car they towed... oh... So you're in charge? Yes. So, talk to me. Why would I talk to you? Because we've got the entire house surrounded And talking to me is going to be your only way out. What did he say? We're surrounded. SWAT's secured the perimeter, sir. Good. Good. Both neighbors have been moved out. Okay. Outgoing calls on the house phone have been routed to us And the psychologist is on his way. E.T.A.? Well, there's a four car pile-up on the one so... Right. - How's my favorite Neapolitan? - Jimmy. It's good to see your boys haven't lost their touch. Promotions. Priorities. Where's our command post? Find out who has access to that community center Up the street and get us in ASAP. Yes, sir. Practice my table hockey. And get all the information on the car The security guard towed. And one more thing. As soon as the media gets wind of this Things are gonna get tight so get someone else To set up an outer perimeter for them. I need you on the towed car and community center. Now. You got it. "Nice Place To Live." So the sign says. Where's the shrink? Route one. So much for therapy. You want to rattle the cage? Let them get the panic out of their system first. I don't want them to do anything stupid. They got a little girl in there. I heard. Dispatch said she was the one who called 911. You okay? Yeah. Let's get to it. Donald. Donald, think about this. We have to be smart. They've got us completely surrounded. There is no way out of this. There's nothing to win here. We can't keep them out and we're not going to get away. We have to turn ourselves in. There's nothing stopping them from coming in here And killing us all! Come on, man. Be reasonable. No one touches the phone! Hey! You guys suddenly an item? Spot. Don't act like you can't hear me! - Spot. - What? I don't need to tell you there's a situation brewing outside. Congratulations, you just did. I think we can help each other. How's that? I could make sure you don't do as much time as your friends. How are you gonna help me? I could tell the police you were here against your will. Go on. I could tell them your friends coerced you And it wasn't until you felt my daughter was in danger Did you step up to try to protect her. And that's when they tied you up. All of a sudden you're not a criminal, you're a hero. And what do you want? The DVDs. I don't want that kind of embarrassment for my family. You want me to...? Destroy them. They have a word for things like that, you know? Suddenly you have morals? Listen, he can get off on dead baby seals for all I care. Then what's your point? Every time you clean up his mess, you let it go on. Do you want to get out of here alive? Because if your psycho friend kills my husband, I'm the only one who can help you. How do you expect me to... In the same room as the DVDs, there's a box labeled "Backyard accessories". You'll find lighter fluid and matches for outdoor grilling. Break them, burn them. I really don't care which. I'm tied up. Get loose. It doesn't have to be like this. You don't have to make this any worse than it already is. You let me go now, I won't press any charges. Is that what they say? Is that what the kids say when you rape them? Do they say, "please, if you let me go I won't tell anyone?" I've never raped anyone! But you want to, don't you? No! No one has movies like that unless they want to! I would never hurt a child! Liar! Leave him alone! Stop hurting him! Enough! Hide. You know, with you out of the way, That little girl might finally start telling the truth About what's been going on around here. Kids are smart, you know? Even if you haven't touched her yet, I bet she knows all about you. - We need to speak with them. - No. No, no, they need to know we're not with Donald on this. We have to reach out to them. No, we can't do that. - They might shoot us. - David, just... Remember, in the papers last month, When they shot all those guys downtown Who tried to rob that bank? They didn't even ask them any questions. They just opened right up on them, All of them dead. It'll be okay. We'll reach out to them first. We can use your phone. No! Sorry, sorry. There has to be another way. Okay. Okay. I'll think of something. Don't worry. Hello? How can we avoid a bad ending? I don't know. You tell me. What's going on over there? Oh, just a couple of buddies having some soda, Sharing some smiles. Cute. What's your name? I mean, you can tell me that right? Donald. Okay, Donald. I am not challenging your reasons For doing what you're doing But it's my job to make sure That no innocent people get hurt. What if they're not innocent? Are you telling me that that family Has committed a crime and you're the innocent party? No, I came here to steal a television to buy drugs. But I've since learned that my little soda drinking buddy here Has quite a little history of breaking the law. Donald, if Mr. Tadesky has broken the law, Tell me about it. Let me help, son. I don't think you can help me. I'm the only one that can at this point. Where's the little girl? She's with me. Let her out. She doesn't have to be involved in this. Talk with you later, Lieutenant. Getting thirsty. No, Donald. Donald, let the... Donald! Donald! Martin, get outta here. Just a statement. You'll get a statement with the rest when I'm ready. Now get out of here, this is a restricted area. Is there a girl in there? Come on, we received a report That a girl called 911 from inside the house. No comment. How are you coping, Lieutenant? Come on, give me a break. Did someone say break? Beat it. Okay! You okay? Stop asking me that. Stop making me ask it. What do we have on Connor Tadesky? We haven't looked. Maybe we should. You don't believe this kid, do you? He's probably jerking us around. He is jerking us around. "Sodas and smiles?" Come on, Charlie. Focus. Look, I know what's going through your head. Is that right? - This isn't downtown. - Jimmy. What happened was unfortunate but we were all cleared then, Which means you gotta be clear now. Just pull up anything you can on him, okay? Fine. I'll get someone on it. Please... Please... Please... Please... No, no... No. Okay. Okay. Find any and all targets and hold. Confirm. Confirm, affirmative, in position. Roger that. This is Walters. Is he in? Phone, phone. This is Lieutenant Tarelli. Okay, here it is. I want a camera crew with a live feed. I want twenty minutes to tell everyone about this man. You do that. I'll come out and all of this will end. Donald, I don't know if I can... Then we don't have a deal and you're wasting my time. If I can swing this for you, I'm going to need something in return. I'm going to need the girl, Donald. You'll get the whole package or nothing when you deliver. The end. Mia? Tai. I'm getting the impression you're not telling me something. No, it's not that. There's just been some complications. Maybe I can help. No, there's nothing you can do. Mia? Where's my television, David? I have it. It's not in pieces, is it, you tweaker? David. No, of course not. David. I called him. I'll call you, I just need... It's Lieutenant Tarelli. W-, Was that Kari? Uh, yeah. Did she just say the word, "Lieutenant?" No, ummm... Phone. It's me. Clean the shed. Now. I don't care that it's your birthday. Go down there and clean the shed top to bottom Or I stop paying the mortgage now and forever. Yeah, call me when it's done. I love you too. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. This is David. David Jonhston? Yes. We have your car, David. I know. Where's Donald? He's in the basement. Where's the little girl? In the basement. With Donald. We have a real problem here, David. I'm kind of in the middle of it. And you could be at the center of helping us out. You want to help us, right? I do. We wanted to just walk out the front door before but we didn't Because we thought that you'd shoot us Like you shot all those people downtown. We don't want to shoot anyone here. You're not going to shoot us? We want you to help us. Okay. I want to help too. Then talk to me. I can come out. Kari can come out. I'm sure Spot will come out. And the mother is up here, too. That's four of us, including one hostage. What about the girl? I told you, Donald has her in the basement with the father. David, can you get us the girl? Not without Donald knowing. He's the one running this, not us. These people are innocent, David. I'm not so sure about that. Meaning what? This guy is a pedophile or something. We found all these DVDs with child pornography on them. That's when Donald went nuts. Okay, David. If he's a criminal, we'll arrest him. But we can't get to that until we get the girl out. But we want to surrender. We want to come out. It's not as simple as that. But we could come out right now. Why isn't that simple? Because if you leave and Donald finds out, It could cause a lot of problems. Mia? We need to get the girl out first. But if we come out, Maybe you guys can come in And you can go from there, You know? Do whatever you have to do. No, no. David what are you doing on the phone? David? Where's the extension? Where is it? David. Get off of me! Get off me! Get off! We really needed a new television. Sorry, buddy. Just talked to "the man." You're out. Don't worry. It's not going to end up in anybody's jacket. Jimmy... Don't you "Jimmy" me. You blew it. I know it and more importantly, he knows it. He's been watching... The only thing he's been watching are his poll numbers. You turned down a chance to have three of the four perps Surrender with one of the three hostages. We could've had them out and a team in To penetrate the basement. You're too close to this. I wasn't close enough the last time! Go home, Charlie. You're done. I have an idea. No, we tried your idea already. But... what are you doing? Just hear it out. You don't like it, I'll shut up and go home. Tell me your idea. Breaking news. Authorities have confirmed a hostage situation In the Vertera Hill community. And while very little is known at this point, Our sources have indicated that the police Have impounded a vehicle from outside of the house Earlier today, A 1969 Buick Electra, Which they believe is involved in a burglary Gone horribly wrong. Back to you. Doesn't David have a car like that? You still want to help? Do I get an exclusive? You'll be behind the scenes with full access. Well, can I have... Time's up. Yes or no. Where's Mia? Where's my daughter? Connor? Connor? What have you done to my husband? Shut up! What are you doing? He can't have sugar. Stop that! I said shut up! Make sure everyone is secured. If they're not, you'll be sorry. Kari help me find Mia. Mia! He's fine. Check the others. Mia! Mia! Mia? Mia? Mia, sweetheart. You can come out now. Mia! Mia! Mia? Mia? Hello? How's it feel to be in the kill zone? Tai, I can explain... Hey. I had my whole lab destroyed because of you. I didn't mean... I could have made a whole lot more money Having you steal ID's. But stealing someone's identity Would have been more a business proposition Than snatching someone's television set And I didn't have you do that Because this was personal not business. It was a personal favor Because that's what you were asking of me. Earth to David. Come in, David. I'm sorry. You're sorry? You're mine now. You get out of this you work for me on the street. You go to jail you'll work for me there. I own you until I say you're free. You made a deal with me, David. There's no way out now. Donald. I think she went out there. It's okay, it's okay! It's okay, it's okay! Just you and me now, David. You and me. Are you sure this is going to work? I am. Thanks. You're shaking. I'm fine. He's not. I know. Come on, finish tying him up. I'm coming. What? Nothing. Let's go, hurry it up. Okay, okay. Let's make sure you didn't do any special favors For your new boyfriend. Are you hearing that? Hear what? Hear what? That sound. Okay, good. Uh, the crew will be here soon. When they get here you'll let them in and bring them down. And if you don't hurry back, You know what happens to your boyfriend. Don't kill this man on television, Donald. It's not about him anymore, David. It's about that little girl. It's about you. Don't do this. It's done. No, it's not. It doesn't have to be. It's been done for years. I've just been killing time. I've had fun. Don't get me wrong. But I've always known that this had to happen. If you do this... All of us are done. You're not listening to me, are you, David? Please, Donald. I can't go out like this. My parents, I need to prove it to them. By stealing somebody's television for drugs? No, David. You're done. Kari's done. Spot was done a long time ago. Gee, thanks. You're welcome. This doesn't... you can just, You can just... I'll never get off meth. None of us will. I can. I can do it. I just need more time. For my parents. For my parents, Donald. I need more time for them. No. David, time's up, David. Your parents are dead. You just want more time not to look at why you're such a mess In the first place. I'm looking, David, and I can see myself. If I can do one good thing for that little girl Maybe what I see won't be so bad. Donald, They might kill us, too. Show time. I know. I know. We're all downstairs. You're running out of chances to save yourself, you know? I'm on it. Prove it. You're not cops, right? No. Good, good. Oh, I'm Donald. Charlie. Entry team, stand by. What's this? It's the information on the Tadeskys The Lieutenant asked for. The father's a diabetic? I guess. "Sodas and smiles." Tell EMS to stand by. Someone stop Charlie. Is he okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah he's fine. Okay. We, uh, we ready to go? Yeah. Hey, if this is a live feed how come there's no wires? Sorry, what? Entry team, move in! I repeat! Move in! There should be wires if it's a live feed, right? Well... Kari! Down on the ground, now! Drop that blade, Donald. Drop it or I will shoot you. What's it going to be? I see her. I see... I sss... Stay with him. Charlie! Charlie! Are we clear? Clear. Where's the girl? Mia? How is he? Okay. Okay. What's it like behind the scenes at a hostage rescue? Join me tonight at eleven for my exclusive coverage. I did it for the children! I was trying to save the children! Hold up. David Johnston. My name is Lieutenant Tarelli. You have the right to remain silent. Who authorized you to pose as media personnel? Well, it was a tactical decision. Don't you think you've unfairly endanger reporters And camera crew in the future? So it's your belief that the suspect Jonathan 'Spot' Williams Was helpful to you as the situation Turned into a hostage scenario? That's correct. Mia. Can you go get me my coat? And you had no idea about the DVDs. The ones that caused Donald Calpeki To suspect your husband Of sexually assaulting children? I honestly had no idea. Okay, that's all for now. It's late. We can follow up tomorrow if we have any more questions. Here's my card in case you need anything. I'm really sorry for your loss. Thank you, Lieutenant. Sure. Thank you. Good work, buddy. Thanks. You had your doubts at first. Are we all right? See you back at the station. Get some sleep, sweetie. You have one new message. First message. It's me. Are you there? Pick up, Jennifer. I found your DVDs. You're not even bothering to hide them anymore. You lied to me. We can't keep moving like this. I'm coming home and you are either going to get help today Or we're getting a divorce And I'll make sure that you never see Mia... Message erased.
