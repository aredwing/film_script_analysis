Take a message. I'm watching explosions. It's Mr. Ackerman. I just talked to him an hour ago. What does he want? I don't know, but he's waiting. Okay. He probably figured out a way he could save a couple bucks. Well, I am not laying anybody else off. Why is it the rich guys are always so cheap? How do you think they got rich in the first place? Hey, Karl. How you doing? For heaven's sakes, I just talked to you an hour ago. - Oh, yeah, right. - Listen, Robert, I told you about my daughter's wedding this Saturday, right? I think you mentioned it. It's going to set you back a bundle, huh? Not anymore. It's been called off. Oh. Oh, well, I'm sorry, Karl. I'm not. It had disaster written all over it, it was going to cost me a small fortune, and I still have to pay all the deposits. Well, what happened? My daughter says she's had a change of heart, but I think her fianc finally came to his senses. Well, I guess the important thing is... The important thing is my weekend has opened up. I'm coming up to the site for a couple of days. We can go over those cutbacks we discussed. Well, that sounds like a great idea, Karl. Your kids. But, you know, my kids are coming up - this afternoon at...? - 2:00. ...2:00, and they're staying through till Tuesday, so... Yes, that doesn't work, Robert. What about your wife? I hope she's coming along. No, Karl, no. My wife's not making this trip. Hmm. Well, I guess we all have our priorities. I'll see you in a couple of days. What a jerk. I don't think I know a bigger jerk. - Do you know a bigger jerk? - You're still on speaker. Kidding. I want you to get something to eat before the plane comes, okay? Hannah! Zach! Almost done, Mom. No, you're not, Zach. You just started. I'm a fast packer. That's because you're a slob. Maybe, but I'm a fast slob. Mom, done. Chinook, you're it. You're it, boy. Chinook, what are you doing? Zach, get out of my room. - We're playing tag. - Zach, get him out of my room. He's messing up everything. What in heaven's name is going on in here? Me and Chinook are playing tag. Zach and Chinook came in my room and messed up my whole suitcase. Okay. It's a good thing he's going with you. Come on, Chinook. Come on. Chinook, come on. Let's go. All right, guys, we're really running late now, so we got to hurry up, okay? Well, you always say I eat too fast. I'm just trying to improve my table manners. He's messing with you, Mom. Thank you, Hannah. I'm aware of that. And he's feeding the dog under the table. Stop feeding the dog at the table. Mom, why can't you come visit Dad with us? Sweetie, I told you I've got too much to do at work right now. She doesn't want to see Dad. Why not? Because they're going through a divorce. Duh. You aren't getting a divorce from Dad, are you? Sweetie, we're just... taking a little holiday from each other. That's all. That's called separation, and you know what comes after that. - Shut up, Zach! - Hannah, stop. Zach, not another word. You know what? I'm the only one that ever tells the truth around here. I'm calling Dad. Yeah? Robert, I have your son on line two. Can you tell him I'm busy right now, please? Maybe you should tell him that yourself. I guess you're right. Of course I'm right. Hey, pal. Dad? You all packed up and ready to go? Yeah, almost ready to go. I'm looking forward to seeing you and your sister. Don't forget Chinook. How could I forget that crazy dog? He is crazy. Anyway, look, buddy, I got to get back to work, so... Wait. I want to tell you about my baseball game yesterday. We were down three runs, and all the bases were loaded. It was the ninth inning. I went up to bat, and then I... Hey, Zach, look, why don't you tell me all this stuff when you arrive in person, okay? I'll see you in a couple hours. Okay? Bye-bye, son. I hit a home run. Dad's busy, huh? He's always busy. Well, then, it'll be up to you guys to take his mind off work for a little while. I think the plane's here. Okay, come on, you two! Let's go. - Don't forget Chinook. - Let's go. Oh, don't worry. He's going. Careful. - Hi, Charlie. - Mrs. Wade, so nice to see you. Oh! Thank you. This is my daughter Hannah and my son Zach. - Hi, Charlie. - It is a pleasure to meet you two. - Hey, Charlie. - Hello. And who is this beauty? That's Chinook. - Oh! Sorry. He gets a little rambunctious sometimes. He's crazy. There you go. Wow. How did you do that? Oh, I know a little bit about dogs, especially these ones. It's a working breed, you know. If they don't have a job to help them burn off the excess energy, they can be a little bit, well, rambunctious. All right, let's get your luggage aboard, shall we? - Come on, boy. - That one's mine. - I figured as much. - Come on, Chinook. All right, you guys. Do whatever Charlie says, okay, and be good. Okay, Mom. Got to go. - All right, honey. All right. - Love you, Mom. I love you too. Oh, I love you, sweetie. I'm wearing the medallion you gave me. Oh, good, sweetie. Good. Have fun, okay? Oh! This is their first time on a small plane, so they might be a little bit scared. - I'm not scared. - Yeah, me neither. Well, don't worry, Mrs. Wade. I'll make sure I take good care of them. Thanks. Have fun, guys. Thanks. Aw, Chinook, why are you making noise? It's okay. It's all right, boy. It's all right. So what do you guys think? You like it up here? Yeah. Yeah. Guess that makes it unanimous. You guys aren't bored back there, are you? - No way, Charlie. - This is really cool, Charlie. I think flying is, like, the only way to fly. I'll have to remember that one. That was kind of stupid, Hannah. Shut up. All right, guys, down there, that's Lake Wipissing. Your dad's mine's on the north end, so we're not too far now. Yay. - Charlie, are you married? - Nope. - Do you have a girlfriend? - No. You seem like a really nice guy and relatively handsome. Thanks. I don't know why you don't have a girlfriend. Well, I guess not too many girls want to come all this way to visit. Maybe that's why Mom didn't want to come. - That's not why. - Shut up, Zach. What's happening? Uh... just a little engine trouble, guys. Just stay calm, and... just make sure your seat belts are on tight. Mayday, Mayday. Cessna 1-8-0-Yankee-whiskey-kilo. Engine failure. Three souls aboard. Zach, I'm scared. Mayday, Mayday. Cessna 1-8-0-Yankee-whiskey-kilo. Declaring an emergency. Over. Are we going to die, Zach? Charlie, there's smoke coming in. Guys, we're going to have to make an emergency landing, okay? I need for you to put your head between your knees now, please. Don't worry, guys. This plane was built to land on water, and the lake's just ahead of us. Guys, prepare for impact! Zach. Zach, are you okay? Are you okay? I think so. Are you okay? I'm okay. Charlie! - Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! We have to get out of here. Can you undo your seat belt? Yeah. I can't get the door open. It won't move. Try kicking it with both feet. Get down on our backs, okay? Ready? On three. One, two, three. - We did it. - Okay, let's go. - Come on, Chinook. - Come on, boy. Chinook. Zach... try your phone. It's busted. The radio. Try the radio. Good idea. Hello. 10-4. Come in, good buddy. It's a plane, Zach, not a truck. Well, I don't know what to say. Mayday, Mayday. Is anybody out there? We need help. Our plane's crashed. Zach... is Charlie... is he dead? No. He's breathing. Charlie, wake up. Charlie, we need your help. Charlie, please! Come on. Come on, boy. What's that? It's the emergency bag Charlie showed us. Oh, yeah. It's got enough food and water to last us a few days. So we'll be okay, and they'll come looking for us, right? I guess so. Daddy will come looking for us. He'll find us. But what about Charlie? He'll wake up soon. He'll be okay. No. No, you don't know that. He needs to go to the hospital. Okay, but what can we do? Well, Charlie said there was a lake near here, right? Yeah, Lake Wipissing, where Daddy's mine is. Maybe if we find the lake, we can find Dad's mine. We can find Dad. And if we find Dad, we can tell him about Charlie... before it's too late. But shouldn't we stay here? I don't know. No, we should help Charlie. Hey. We should leave the rest of the stuff in the emergency bag for Charlie. Yeah. I'll do it. No. I'll do it. Bye, Charlie. Which way do we go? Well, Charlie was trying to get to the lake, and he flew in that way, obviously. So we follow the line, and we should get to the lake. Yeah. Ackerman Mines. Robert Wade's office. Search and Rescue just called. They received a distress call from Charlie's plane. Then it fell off the radar. Okay. I've updated the third-quarter results for the Markdale Steel account. Oh, hang on a second, Dave. I've got another call coming in. - Hello. - Hey, Susan. It's me. Hi. Kids get there okay? Susan, there's a... there's a problem. Search and Rescue received a distress call from the plane, and then they lost contact with it. What do you mean they lost contact? What does that mean? We don't know what happened yet. Search and Rescue's on their way right now. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I should have been with them. I mean, Hannah wanted me to come with them. Can you get yourself to Goose Bay? Will you be able to drive? Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. I'm on my way. I'm going to have a plane waiting for you, okay? Yeah. Okay. Come on, boy. - Need a hand? - Yeah. Whew. Zach, slow down. I'm so tired. All right, let's take a little break. Lie down. Okay, down, boy. Hey, hey, hey, lie down. Lie down. Zach, don't drink so much. We don't know how long the water has to last. Hannah, relax. We're going to a lake, remember? We'll have all the water we need. We're not there yet. We have to be careful we don't run out. Are you sure we're still heading in the right direction? Yeah, pretty sure. I was following the sun, but it's kind of hard to see it right now. What do you mean? Are we lost? No, we're not lost. We're just not exactly sure where we're going. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. I think we should go back to the plane and wait with Charlie. There is no way we can get back there. So we don't know where we're going, and we don't know where we came from. That sure sounds like we're lost to me. We're not lost. All I need to do is just find a clearing, and I'll know where I'm going. Where did you learn to do that? Cub Scouts. That doesn't fill me with confidence. "That doesn't fill me with confidence. " Zach, what are you doing? He's thirsty. He's spilling it all over the place. He's a dog. Zach! Come on, boy. - Zach. - We'll find the lake. We'd better. They're here, Robert. Hi. I'm Robert Wade. Captain Walker, Mountain Search and Rescue. This is Sergeant McCoy. - Hey. - Hi. This is Bill Peters, my aviation manager. - Pleased to meet you. - Hi, Bill. So what can you tell us? Well, our best guess is that the plane went down about 50 miles from here, to the south, obviously. Our problem is that we can't tell how far off course the pilot might have strayed. So, "best guess," does that mean that you can't pinpoint exactly where the plane went down? We could, depending on the ELT. That's the emergency locator transmitter. It sends out an automatic distress signal. It's g-force-activated on impact. The newer ELTs are digital. They carry detailed information about the aircraft and the owner, and they give precise GPS coordinates. The exact location can sometimes be pinpointed in as little as five minutes. Well, Charlie had one of those on his plane, didn't he? No, Robert, we're still using the analog ELTs. What? That technology is outdated. The signal is no longer detectable by satellite, only ground-based receivers, and that's if they're near one. Why didn't you upgrade the planes, Bill? I've been fighting with Ackerman on this for years. The analog ELTs are still legal. You know the old man. He's never going to cough up for new ones until he's forced to. Well, you should have come to me. It wouldn't have been any use. Gentlemen, please. I'm sorry, Bill. I know it's not your fault. Okay. Charlie and the kids... what are their chances? Well, our best-case scenario is that they had a successful water landing. We know they've got enough supplies in the plane to last them until we find them. But if they went down in the forest... well, sometimes there are survivors. We're establishing a base camp about a mile from here, we're gathering a team to coordinate the search effort, and a helicopter is being brought in from Goose Bay. Okay, how long is that going to take? Three to four hours. My kids are out there. - I understand, Mr. Wade... - No, you don't. Now, I have a chopper here. It'll be dark soon, and our helicopter has thermal-imaging equipment. We can see people on the ground right through the trees. Well, I'm sure it's going to come in very handy when it finally gets here, but for now, we're going to go looking for my kids. Yeah. Okay. I don't see any clearing. Do you? - We'll find one. - What's wrong with Chinook? He's thirsty, just like me. Well, you're not getting any of my water, 'cause you wasted all yours. I know, Chinook. She's mean. Wait a minute. Chinook, boy, you thirsty? You want a drink? Huh? You want a drink? - You don't need to tease him. - I'm not. I saw this dog on TV that could find water by scent, by smelling it, so I thought Chinook could find the lake by sniffing it out. - Pretty good. - Mm-hmm. Go get water. - Let's follow him. - Let's follow him. We're approaching the south end of the lake. According to the timetable, Charlie should have made it this far. I don't see anything. Well, there's no debris. That could be a good sign. I'm going to fly over the bush while we still have some light. It's going to be really tough to spot anything down there. I don't know, Hannah. I don't think this is going to work. Maybe... and I don't want to lose Chinook. Well, you better call him. Why do I have to call him? 'Cause I can barely breathe. Well, it was your idea. You shouldn't believe everything you see on TV. Well, you thought it was a good idea. Well, I was just being supportive. Good job, boy! You did it, Chinook! You found the lake! - Whoa! - You found it. Good job, boy. You know what? Water's a really good drink. It's so beautiful. Should be enough for now. Thanks. Oh, no. Chinook's running off again. Come on, let's go. Get back here, Chinook! Come on, boy! Chinook! Where are you going? Chinook. It's a cave. Did you make sure there's no bear in there? He's home, but he's very friendly. Come on. You'll like it. Okay. Wow. It's huge. Need a hand? Pretty nice, huh? Yeah. It's a lot bigger from the inside. Exactly, we're out of the wind, and if it rains, we're covered. But it's cold. It's all right. I'll make a fire, and Chinook can keep us warm. Are you sure there's no bear in here? I already told you he's friendly. I'm just kidding. There's no bear. We're ready to head out, sir. You know I can't force you to go out there all night. It's going to be dangerous. Yeah, well, I had no trouble finding any volunteers, and when there's kids out there, we're going to search as long as we have to. Remember, I have kids of my own. Okay, just keep in touch constantly. - Yes. - And don't take any chances. - We'll be fine. - All right. Sergeant McCoy, you're with me. This is a good fire, Zach. Thanks. Good thing we had those matches in the emergency bag. I could have started it without the matches. And let me guess. You learned how to do that at Cub Scouts. Yep. One sandwich each for dinner. What about Chinook? I guess he gets some too. Only fair. You really liked Cub Scouts, didn't you? I guess it was okay. So why did you quit? I didn't quit. Dad did. What do you mean? Well, he's the one who signed me up. We were going to do all this cool stuff, like camping and contests and stuff, but he was always too busy, and all the other dads went, and I felt like a stupid orphan. Well, his work is just so far away, Zach. Well, remember how he was coming on the weekends? Still never did. It's just because he's so busy. Yeah, well, he's always busy. Hey. No luck, I assume. No, nothing. What do you think their chances are? We got plane wrecks up there from the '60s that we still haven't found. Really? Might as well be the Amazon. This forest is just as dense. That's provided they survived impact, of course. Oh, those poor kids, they're so young. Yeah, and we got another concern. What's that? Mating season for the grizzlies. Males will be on the prowl, very grumpy, looking for a fight. Well, let's just hope we find them first. Are they really getting divorced, Zach? I think so. But why? I know Mom was always complaining about Dad being away so much, but maybe now she wants him to stay away. Or Dad just doesn't want to be around Mom... or us. Is it our fault? Did we do something wrong? No, no, of course not. No. Well, we fight a lot. Hannah, they're not going to get divorced 'cause we fight a lot. How do you know? What is it, boy? Hannah, there's something in the cave. Is it a bear? How should I know? You said there wasn't a bear in here. Well, I didn't go all the way back. That wasn't very thorough. Get away from me! Get away from me! It was birds, just birds. Just birds, no bear. How do you know that? What if the bear scared the birds? I better go get Chinook. Wait. Wait. Do you hear that? Do you hear that? - Hear what? - A helicopter! - Zach, there's a helicopter! - Come on! Where is it? - It's up there! - Hey! We're down here! - We're down here! - We're down here! - We're down here! - Hello! We're down here! - Over here! - We're down here! - Down here! Come on! - Down here! - Come on down! - We're down here! - We're down here! We're here! - Here! - We're here! We're down here! - We're down here! - We're down here! Hello! We're down here! Whoops! We're down here! Hello! Look over here! - We're down here! - Down here! - We're down here! - Come here! At least we know they're looking for us. - No luck, Mr. Wade? - No, nothing. Hmm. Well, as you know, our main chopper started a search a couple hours ago. Did they spot anything with the infrared? No, just wildlife. We're going to have them stay out tonight as long as their fuel lasts, and in the morning... we'll be sending in additional teams on foot. - Okay. - Okay? My children have to spend the night out there? Susan. Captain Walker, this is my wife Susan. Mrs. Wade. At this point, yes, it looks like the kids will be out all night. Well, how cold will it get? Just a few degrees colder than here. Looks like it's going to stay above freezing, so as long as they stay in the plane or find some form of shelter, they will be at minimal risk of exposure. Minimal risk? Yes, ma'am. What about the emergency locator transmitter? Has that been any help at all? No, we lost the signal. It died. Well, how'd that happen? It must have been damaged or a short circuit. Anyway, the battery died. It sometimes happens with these older analog ELTs. But if that plane had modern equipment, we would have found our kids by now. Isn't that right, Captain Walker? How do you know about all this? Sheila told me. Quite possibly, yes. So what are we going to do? Well, at this point, the important thing is to stay calm. Would you be calm if it were your children out there? No, I would not, but rest assured, Mrs. Wade, we are doing everything we can to find your children. Fine. Susan. What, Robert? Where are you going? They set me up in a trailer. I'm going to go back there and not sleep. Well, there's a canteen here. Do you want to go get a hot meal or cup of coffee? No. I'm just going to go back to the trailer. I'll see you in the morning. Susan. We're going to get our kids back. I promise. Don't. No more promises. Was it worth it? Was what worth it? All of this... your job, the money, all this time away from your family? It's already ruined our marriage. Now maybe we're going to lose our kids too. Is it worth it? I don't think we'll ever find Daddy's mine. Maybe it's too far away. Yeah, maybe. I don't think we should stay here either. They've already looked here. Hey, do you see that flat thing up there? Yeah. That big flat area-looking thing? You mean like a plateau? Yes, brainiac, like a plateau. Maybe if we get up there, they'll be able to see us, they can find us. - Yeah, let's go. - All right. Now, we believe the plane went down somewhere in this area, so we've divided the map into six. There will be six teams, each assigned your particular section of the grid. Now, you've all got your maps? - Yes, sir. - Good. Gear checked out? - You bet. - Good. Any questions? So let's go get this done, people. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Morning, Mrs. Wade. Captain Walker, we want to join one of the search teams. I'm afraid I can't let you do that, even if I wanted to. Look, every one of these rangers is certified and highly trained. Well, come on. We can walk through the woods as well as any of those guys. And get lost or hurt or worse, and then I'd have to find you. Would you want me diverting resources from the search for your children? Of course not, but we're not going to sit here doing nothing. Look, folks, I know how difficult it is. No, I don't think you do. I've got to go. I know you want me to do my job. Come on. We're going up in the company chopper. Let's go. I was just looking for you, Robert. Bill, can we get the chopper up? It's back at the hangar. The mechanics found a pretty severe oil leak this morning. Well, how long is it going to take to fix? May be some engine damage. Could be a couple of days. Well, if the chopper's in such bad shape, how well did you take care of Charlie's plane? Ackerman's cut us down to a skeleton crew. You know that. I also know Charlie Foster, and that plane did not go down because of pilot error. You're right. We're doing the best we can, but maybe it's not enough. Oh, my God. What are we going to do now? I don't know. Maybe Walker's right. Maybe we ought to just stay put and let the professionals do their job. Those are my children out there, Robert. Well, they're my kids too, Susan. You think I'm not scared to death right now? I'm sorry. It's just that those two can barely be left alone at home. They're not equipped to deal with trying to survive out there in the woods. Well, you know, Charlie's with 'em. He's going to take care of them, and they have Chinook, who's going to give them all kinds of protection. You got to be kidding me. That dog hid under Zach's bed for an hour last week after I scolded him for chewing up a newspaper. Look, I get your point, but we got to stay positive about this. We have got to believe that Charlie, Hannah, and Zach are going to come back okay. I hope you're right. Okay. Come on. Come on, boy. This way. Wow, huh? Yeah, how are we going to get across this? I don't know. There must be another way downstream. Let's go. We can cross here. Be careful, Zach. Yeah. Come on, boy. Come on, go. Come on, boy! Come on. - Go, bud. - Come on, boy. Good boy. Right there. All right, toss me your pack. You scared? Come on. Okay, I don't have all day. Shut up, Zach! Hannah! Help me! Help me! Hannah! Help! Help me! Help me! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Are you okay? I think I hurt my ankle. - You seem really cold. - I'm freezing. All right, we need to make a fire, and fast. Chinook saved my life. I really made a mess of things, didn't I? You really want to get into this right now? I love them so much. Yeah. Me too. I love you too. Oh, Robert, please. No... I want to be a family again. I'll quit my job up here. I'll get something close to home. I don't care. I just want to try again. Please. I can't talk about this right now. All I can think about is getting Zach and Hannah home safely. How's your ankle feeling? It's really sore. I think I might have sprained it. I'm so stupid. I shouldn't have made you cross the river. You didn't make me. I have a mind of my own, you know. Yeah, well, I could have gotten you killed. I'm supposed to look after you. Well, you're looking after me, I'm looking after you, and guess what. What? Chinook is looking after both of us. You can say that again. Chinook is looking after both of us. Okay, I didn't mean it literally. Chinook is looking after both of us. Okay, I think three times is enough. - Chinook is looking after... - All right. I'm going to grab some more firewood. - Take Chinook with you. - No, you need him. I'll be fine, Zach. Okay. Come on, boy. Let's go. Zach? Get away from me! Go away! - Get away from me! - Hannah? Go! Hannah! Go! Get away from me! Get out! Are you okay? Yeah. What did you throw at that wolf? A baseball. There was a baseball in the emergency pack? No, it's my baseball, the one that I hit the home run with. The super slam? Grand slam. Oh. Well, good thing you brought it. I thought it'd come in handy if I had to throw it at a wolf. Good thinking. Here, boy. Come here. How are you? All right, we need to get out of here. Let's go, bud. Let's go. Base to chopper. Any signs of the wreckage? Over. Negative, base. Proceeding to sector 3G. Over. Roger that. Whoa. Come on, boy. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, bud. Come on. Come on, help me. Base camp, this is red team leader. There is no sign of the targets here in sector 5B. We're going to head southeast to Pine Ridge. Roger that, team leader. Proceeding to Pine Ridge. Over. Copy that, base camp. Over. Ow! Ouch! Ouch! Are you okay? No. My ankle really hurts. I don't think I can walk. Go on. Leave me here. Are you kidding me? Yes! If you left me here, I'd kill you! Funny. Ouch. I have an idea. Hold on to Chinook. Boy, good boy. Come here, boy. Come here. I need you. Zach, what's that? It's called a travois. It's kind of like a sled. So Chinook's going to pull me? Well, remember how Charlie said Chinook was a working dog. Well, this will be his first real job. Grab on to my arm. Can you get on? So you learned to make this in Cub Scouts? Yep. You definitely shouldn't have quit. You could have become a Beagle Scout. It's Eagle, not Beagle. All right, you ready, boy? You ready? - I'm not sure I'm ready. - Let's go! Ow. Ow. Ow, ow, ow. - Does your ankle hurt? - No, my bum. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. At what point do we call in the military? Mr. Wade, this is not a military operation. The local police are already assisting us with two of their choppers. Two choppers? Two? Captain Walker, Robert's right. I mean, surely in a situation like this, we need every available aircraft. I agree with my wife. Mr. and Mrs. Wade, we have more resources on this search than any other Search and Rescue operation in my career. We have volunteer teams out at night because there are children involved. We have systematically searched the entire area where we think the plane could have gone down, and we will keep on searching until we find your children and the pilot. Look, I'm sorry, Captain. We're not suggesting that your people aren't doing their jobs. Of course we appreciate everything that the volunteers are doing, but our children may be running out of time here. What can we do that we're not already doing? If there was something additional we could be doing, we would be doing it. Trust me. In situations like this, it's often about persistence and patience. This is no time to panic. But we haven't had one inkling of hope, not one indication that our children are still alive. It's a big wilderness out there, Mr. Wade, but this is a big operation. We will find your kids. Guys, it's here! Come on! Here. Charlie. Charlie. Take some. The kids aren't here. Base camp, this is red team leader. We have found the plane. Repeat... we have found the plane. Roger that, team leader. Go get the Wades. Are there any survivors? Over. Charlie. I thought you'd never get here. Do you copy, team leader? Here. Drink some more. Do you copy, team leader? Are there any survivors? Over. Drink some water. So aside from being not dead, how are you, buddy? I think my legs are broken. Base camp, pilot is alive and conscious, appears to have nonlife-threatening injuries. Request immediate medical evac. Over. Roger that, team leader. Over. - You found the plane! - What about our kids? The pilot has survived. We're still waiting for status on the children. Team leader, what's the status on the minors, Hannah and Zach Wade? Over. Base camp, stand by. Charlie, where are the kids? Give me the... give me the radio. - What? - Give me the radio. This is Charlie. I want to talk to Robert. Over. Charlie, it's Robert. Thank God you're okay. Where's Zach? Where's Hannah? - Over. - Over. I think they're all right, Robert, but they're not here. They left the site. Over. Charlie, what do you mean they left? Where did they go? - Over. - Over. When I came to, dog and the kids, they were gone. Okay, they... they took some emergency supplies, and Hannah, she... she left me a note. They went to get help... for me. Over. Oh, my God. Wow, look at this. Yeah, it's beautiful. This is a good place to stay tonight. What is it, boy? Hannah, there's fish here! What kind? I don't know. The big kind. They're salmon, Zach. Catch one. Okay. Give me my fishing rod. I'm serious, Zach. They come upriver at this time of the year to spawn. To what? To lay their eggs. After that, they're really tired and so slow that you can catch 'em with your bare hands. I learned it on TV. Come on, Zach. I'm starving. Okay. I'll try. Get 'em. Get it. - What? No! Don't let it go! - Crap! Get him. Squeeze. Come on. Squeeze him tight. Get him! Get him! No, you don't. Crap. Nuh-uh. No, you... Ah. Oh. I got one! Ah, the fishy! Oh, fishy! Fishy! I can get him. It's upside down. - I got him. - Let's eat. - Whoo! Charlie. Charlie! Hey. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Charlie. I don't know what happened. I'm so sorry. Charlie, you landed that airplane. As far as I'm concerned, you saved our kids' lives. No word yet? No. No, not yet. They're smart kids, and they... they got the perfect dog with them. - Chinook? - You think so? I know so. Ms. Wade. You've got to start calling me Susan. Susan. What is it? "Hi, Charlie. Zach and Chinook and I are all okay... but you're hurt, and we have to go find a doctor. We'll be back soon. Hannah. " Take care, Charlie. Thank you. This is really good, Zach. Yeah. And I think Chinook likes it too. Don't you, boy? Don't you? I didn't know you had to clean a fish before you cooked it, and I didn't know it'd be so gross. They didn't teach you how to clean a fish in brainiac school? No, and I don't want to hear any more about Cub Scouts. That's not where I learned it. Remember two years ago, the fishing trip Dad took me on? - Oh, yeah. - He taught me. And that was the last time I actually spent a whole weekend with him. They must be really worried about us. - Mom and Dad? - Yeah. Mom might. They both are, Zach. If you say so. What do you mean you're removing resources from the search? I've got three hikers lost on the east ridge. I've got a family of four capsized their canoe in Gull Lake. We are so close. They found the plane. But your children left the crash site, and, frankly, because of that, our chances for success are greatly diminished. They could have gone anywhere. That's where you're wrong. My son was a Cub Scout for almost three years. He learned survival skills. He knows orientation. He can find his way in the woods. Mrs. Wade, with all due respect, a Cub Scout? Listen to me. Look, if they were looking for a doctor, they would go where there are people. We need to be looking between the crash site and the camp. That's a good theory. I will take that into consideration. Now, please, I've got work to do. Susan. What you said makes perfect sense. Good. Then find us a vehicle. I want to go back to the mining camp and start our search from there. Okay. Bill Peters is coming up soon. We'll take his jeep or whatever else he brings. Great. I'll be in my trailer. Susan. Zach quit Cub Scouts? He did. I thought he liked it. He did, but you should know that, shouldn't you? I should, yeah. He also loved baseball. He actually hit his first home run last week. He was so excited to tell you all about it, but you didn't have time. Zach quit Cub Scouts because he was embarrassed that his father was never around. All right, let's take a break here. Yeah. I like it here. It's pretty. Come here, boy. I'm kind of sick of granola bars. Yeah, me too. Hey. Zach, look. Hey, get out of here! Get out! Get out! He ate my last granola bar. Aw, it's so cute. I wish I had one as a pet. Yeah. It'd eat us out of house and home. No, Chinook. You'll scare the poor thing. Good boy. Oh, Zach, don't be so mean. You practically rang the dinner bell for it. All right, let's get a move on. Bye, little friend. Come on, bud. We can see for miles up here. Zach, what's that? Fire? Hannah, we've got a serious problem on our hands. Let's get out of here. - Hey. - Hey. Great news. Just heard from the hospital, and Charlie's going to be okay. He's going to be laid up for a while while his legs heal, but... That's great news. Poor Charlie. I can't imagine what it was like for him out there in pain all that time. Well, the important thing is that he survived, and... now we know that Zach and Hannah survived. For me, it's a major miracle. Where are they, Robert? Where are they? They could be anywhere. I mean, they could have wandered off anywhere. They thought about going to get help for Charlie, and, to me, that says that we raised them right. Yeah. Susan... we are going to find them. I promise you. Yeah. - What are you doing, Chinook? - What is it, boy? What is it? - Why won't he go forward? - Come on, go. Go. Chinook. Chinook. Run! Where is it? Go, go, go! Get in. Come on. No! Help! Look out! Help! Go away, bear! Is it gone? I don't know. Where's Chinook? Chinook! Chinook, boy, come here! Chinook, boy, where are you? - Chinook! - Chinook. - Come here, boy. - There you are, boy. Chinook. Chinook. - Chinook. - Bring him over. Hey, buddy. Missed you. Where did you go? Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm sorry, Mr. Wade. The search is over. - I have to pull my teams out. - Why? A forest fire is engulfing the valley. I have no choice. I've got to go. I'm sorry. If we go higher, the air will be better. Yeah, this is it. The plateau? Yeah. They'll be sure to find us from up here. - We did it. - We did it. - We did it. - Yes. I can't believe we did it. We're actually here. We're here, boy. We're here. - We're here, boy. - We're here. Boy. Here, boy. Here. We're here, buddy. We're here. Yeah, we're here. We're here, buddy. We did it, boy. Yay, we did it. We did it, boy. Come here. - Would you two calm down? - We did it. No, we did it. We did it. Yay! We're here, buddy. - We're here! - Would you two calm down? Ah! Zach! Zach? Zach, are you okay? I'm okay, but there's no room. I can't move. You have to find help. Zach, I won't leave you here. It's all up to you now, boy. You have to help us. Now go. Go, buddy! Go! Go, Chinook! Go! Go! Go! - Zach. - Yeah? Don't look down. Okay, thanks. - Zach. - Yeah? Let's talk about something. What do you want to talk about? Anything you want. Let's talk about RC helicopters. I can't talk about RC helicopters. Okay. Then what do you want to talk about? Let's talk about ballet. Oh, boy. Look, we're going to find a way, okay? Robert! Robert, Chinook! Chinook. Come here, Chinook. Come on. - Chin... - Let's follow him. Come on, let's follow him. - Zach. - Yeah? Do you know who likes you? No. Jennifer. She told me. Oh. Okay. Do you like her? I guess she's okay. She really, really likes you. - I'd rather talk about ballet. - Okay. Chinook! Zach, it's Chinook! And he brought help, Zach! Hi, boy. Hi. Mommy! Daddy! - Mommy! Daddy! - Hannah! Thank God, baby. - Where's Zach? - You okay? - I'm okay. - Where's Zach? - Where's your brother? - Down there. He's not okay. It's okay. - Zach? - Dad, is that you? Zach. I'm here. Are you hurt? No, but if I move, I... Don't move. Don't move. I'm going to come down and get you. - Hey. - Susan. Susan. - What? - I'm going to go down there. I'm going to get Zach back, but I need your help. - What do you want me to do? - Drive. Okay, Hannah, you come with me. Okay. Okay, don't get too close to the edge. I'm going to tell you what I want your mom to do, and you're going to tell her, - okay? - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Tighten it up! - All right. Oh. How's that? Just stay right there. Okay, forward. Forward. Keep coming. That's it, son. Keep coming. - Okay. - Get that. Okay. You okay? - Yeah. - You're okay, pal. It's okay. You're okay. I'm going to get your legs in this, all right? Step in there. That's it. Now step in the other side. Hold on to me. Okay, look, you're going to turn around, put your feet into the cliff, and then lean back on me, and then we're going to go up, okay? - Okay. - Okay? Hey, I'm not going to let you fall. Okay. All right. Hannah, pull back slowly. Slowly. Backwards! Keep going. All right. Okay, you ready? How's that? Yeah? Now just go. Walk. Walk. That's it. Is that okay? How's that? Backwards. Backwards. Keep going. You're good. That's it. Just sit back, and walk. Sit back, and walk. Sit back, and walk, all your weight back at me. Let it pull you up. That's it. You're doing good. Keep going. You can do it. That's it. That's it. Lean back in. Attaboy. That's it. Okay, watch out. Okay, stop! - Stop! - Okay. - Oh, baby. - Mom! Baby, come here! Oh, God. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Are you okay? Oh, my God. Oh, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - We're here, okay? - Yeah. Hey, come here. Come here. Got to get out of here. - Hop in, guys. Hop in. - Come here, boy. - Chinook. Up. Up. - Seat belts. Come on, boy. Come on, up. Good boy. I got you. I got you, boy. You ready to go home? You mean all of us? Yeah... all of us. Let's go.
