It's all right. I've got this. Thanks, Joe. Hey, maybe she gets nicer on vacation. Holy crappola, Tessa! You've scuffed my favorite bag! I'm sorry, Divine. Uh, this is a lot to carry. Well, we're all pitching in, Tessa. - I'll bring the cart. Sir, can I... - Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No! No way am I tipping those vultures. No! No! Oh. Oh. Oh. Be extra careful of Sparkles. Who's a good dog? Who's a good dog? - Divine? - What? Yes? He's dead. Not in my heart, Tessa. Mom! The VIP Princess Package Includes a costume party, and Reed West is performing. Let me see! Olympia, must you... Even better, we get our own private 1-minute Reed West encounter. We're in it for a lot more than 7 minutes, Athena. We're here to win. Okay, I'll be there in a minute. Oh, a pool! Athena, you need to put on your bikini and sit by that pool. - Okay. - Not you, Olympia. Oh, my God! These girls look like pros. They don't have superstar's blood coursing through their veins. Remember, girls, you're Madonna's third cousins. Twice removed. It's not a lot of blood. Blood is blood. If I were 10 years younger, I'd snag that role myself. Uh-oh. Janet's here. Her parents sent her to music camp In New York. See you ladies at the VIP lunch. Can't wait! Oh, Bianca's here, too. Lauren! Divine! I almost didn't recognize you with your new face. Would like the number? They do lipo as well. I've forgotten how dreadfully witty you are. So we're really excited about this week, right, Blanca? Bianca? Sweetheart? Darling? Bianca. Sweetheart. Yeah, I'm so excited. She's a bit of a slug, isn't she? No, she's been rehearsing. You've only brought one assistant. So brave. Oh, I'm not her assistant. I'm her stepdaughter. - Uh, Tessa? - Yeah? Could you please go get Sparkles? - Get Sparkles! - Yes, right away, Divine. Thank you. She's a bit sensitive about her position In life. Well, it's been fascinating, but now I'm bored. - Tessa, we're on the move! - Right away! Oh, Reed! I would sell body parts for you. Good ones. Argh, gross! Stop drooling, Olympia. Argh. He's definitely worth a kidney. He looks taken. Who's the girl? Argh. Harper Halston. The heiress. She's so pretty. Her family owns Royal Lagoons Resorts. They're holding the audition contest. You'd know all this if you weren't so busy greasing up carburetors or whatever. - You mean my job. - Not this week, Tessa. You're here to help Athena and Olympia focus on one thing. Dazzling Reed and winning the lead role. One of you girls is going to star in the musical, win that recording contract, and do me proud. I named you after goddesses for a reason. What's the musical? - Cinderella. - Cinderella. Okay, that's kind of ironic. You, follow me. Yes, ma'am. You are going to love your little room. - It's right this way. - Okay, all right. This is like having your own spa. Right through here. Here we go. Nice and cozy under the stairs. So I'm Harry Potter. Exactly. Now, um, be careful of the gate because it locks from the outside, and don't tell anyone you're here, okay? Oh, I'm gonna get Into so much trouble for this. Don't worry. It's not exactly something I'll instagram. Yeah. Thanks. Olympia, stop that! That's disgusting. Stop It! Oh, my God! What are you doing? Stop it! Don't eat that. Don't you dare put that In your mouth! I cannot believe you humiliate me this way. Oh, dear. Oh... Hello. Hello. - Not really ready, yeah. - I think you have this In the bag. I've never seen such a dull group of girls. You remember Janet? - Oh, yes. Jane. Hello. - It's Janet. Oh, you dropped... Oh. Whoops. - Whoops. - Whoops. - Tessa. Tessa. Ah! - Ow! Tessa. Ah. Ladies... - Oh, thank you so much. - Lovely. She's just a little slow, but, you know, she smells good, so we keep her around. Well, she's learning. You're so bad! Hello! Hello! Welcome, VIPs! You know, by the looks of this crowd, you'd think VIP stands for very beautiful person. I guess then It'd be VBP, but... Uh, thank you! Welcome, everyone! I'm Freddy Marks, the director, and you all know pop sensation Reed West. Hi. It's lovely to be here. I discovered Reed on YouTube, and now I'm hoping to find a brand new star right here In this very room. Harper sang a romantic duet with Reed. Will you be next? Now, auditions will be held tomorrow morning, and the show will premiere on the very last night of your VIP stay. So this is gonna be a fast-paced, exciting adventure for all those who make the cast, especially one very lucky young lady.

Oh, hey, Georgie, who's your friend? - You know me. I'm... - She's a guest, Eddie. She's a guest. You need anything, you just... You let us know. I can sweep. Sweep your room. We sweep... We sweep rooms. We... He didn't recognize me, and I've worn his coveralls before. Okay, don't know what that means, but I feel vindicated. Now you have to audition. Georgie, look, your makeup brushes are like magic wands, but I can't do this. My family will recognize my voice Immediately. Then disguise it. Here we are. It's not like, "I'm Olympia!" It's like, "I'm Olympia. I'm here. I'm yours." Okay, I'm going- - I'm gonna do this. - Okay, go. Okay, I'm gonna go. - Tess, go. - Okay. You're not listening to me. Wow, Janet, you look great, and don't worry. No one will even notice that huge vein bulging out of your forehead. Young lady. Are you a VIP guest? I didn't see you at the brunch. Um... The trolley broke. The trolley? Yes, it's a bloody shame. The trolley broke. I know you from somewhere. No, um, I don't think so. The Niedermeyer Bar Mitzvah? Did we Hava Nagila? I don't think I had that pleasure, ma'am. - Oh, you didn't have that pleasure. - No. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. The National Dog Show in Philly? Afraid not.

Don't let her get away! Don't let her get away! Stop it! Stop it! Stop that! Well, I guess the fairy tale gods have spoken. The way you two danced together! - It was like a fairy tale. - I bet he's gonna pick you. It doesn't matter. You saw Divine. She'd get me disqualified In a heartbeat. We'll come up with a fake name, and It'll all work out. Georgie, I'm really sorry. I really appreciate everything you've done for me... But I think it's time for me to get back to my real life. But thank you. Sit up straight. Sit up straight. All right, I'd just like to start off by saying thank you very much to everyone here for auditioning today. We'll be posting a cast list soon of the secondary roles, but I've found my Cinderella. Now I just need to actually find her. The mystery Cinderella, she lost her dance shoe today at the audition. It's a very special shoe. Uh, if you're the owner of that matching shoe, then please come forward by midnight tomorrow. And the role is yours. Thank you. Go! Go! Go! Out of my way! Out of my way! Excuse me. Follow me. Try to keep up. Try to keep up. Coming through! Coming through! - This one? - No. - This one? - No. - This one? - No. - This one? - No. - This one? - No. - This one? - I'm not sure. Think, Olympia. Round up every last little brain cell that's In there. Good morning. - This one? - No. - This one? - No. - This one? - No. - Th is one? - Walt. Yes, that's the shoe flower. That's the one. Oh, Tessa, you need to paint that flower on this shoe. Um... There's no point because If he has the matching... Nobody else knows about the hand-painted flower. He has to pick somebody by midnight. - Go! Go! Go! - Okay. - Go! Go! Go! - Okay. Guess what? Get Loose just made the Billboard Hot 100! Wow, that was fast. See? I told you that to work with Harper would be gold for your career. It's Reed! If anybody is interested, the supporting cast list has just been posted backstage. Come on, let's go. Okay, I tried, but I just really don't think this is gonna work. It's... What happened? Did someone die? Worse. Bianca got cast as fairy godmother. Janet is the evil stepmother, and all we get to play ls - the ugly stepsisters. - Ugly stepsisters. How could they possibly think that we should play those mean, horrible, self-absorbed girls! Gosh, it boggles the imagination, doesn't It? Finally. What, did you paint it with your toes? As usual, I'll take care of things, right, girls? Uh, hello? Doorbell. Olympia, sit up straight. Athena, stop looking so depressed. It's from Reed West. "Reed West requests the company of..." No! What is it? What's wrong? You! Why does he want to see you? What? I saw you at Reed's announcement, making gooey eyes at him. No, that's... You plucked your eyebrows for him, didn't you? No, I didn't. I didn't. It's just a big misunderstanding. It's just... Well, we'll find out, shall we? Come with me. Girls! Girls, we're leaving. "I don't want to go!" We're gonna get to the bottom of this right now, little missy, and if you screwed things up for my girls, I... - Girls, try to keep up! - That's R. Reed? Reed West? I have Tessa here. You wanted to see her? Wait. Oh, yes, been trying to track you down. You have? Why would you want to see her? - Why, I just need your help. - You do? - The show kind of depends on it. - It does'? Yeah. What is... The mechanic said you were the one who got Lt started yesterday. Yeah. Yeah, I did. I'm sorry for mistaking you for a dude. It's my bad. It's okay. I'm just glad every/thing's all cleared up. Right. Well, there's... Yeah, there's a little clunking noise coming from the... Uh... From the motorcycle. - From the bike? - Yeah. - Um, could you describe the clunking? - Like a... Okay, is it like a fast... Like a... Kind of. Well, it starts off... It starts off like It's building, - so it's a bit more... - Okay, like a... No, it's more like a... - Like a train. - I don't know what trains you've heard. Yes, it cuts out, and If I try and do It again, It goes... Yeah, I think I know it. Well, we just need to get It fixed, If we can. Otherwise, Cinderella won't have a pumpkin carriage. I can try. Wait, wait, wait. If I let my darling Tessa do this for you, you have to do something for me. You have to let my talented daughters audition again. They had an eensy problem the first time. By the way, prepare to have your mind blown. Uh... Yeah, deal. Come on, girls, we have to practice. - Bye, Reed. - Bye. Olympia! Freddy, can we set Tessa up In the prop room, please? It's not bad as it looks. I swear. Well, this is nothing compared to the hot mess I just saw. I'm sure. I kind of overheard a little bit. Okay, so these are the parts that I need you to get so that I can fix your pumpkin carriage. Where did you learn to do all this? Um, my dad was a race car driver. Yeah, he had his own repair shop, so I was basically working on cars before I could walk. Is your dad still racing cars now? I hope so. In heaven. Could you pass me the 9/16 spanner? - No. - Oh, the wrench. Oh... - No, I don't know what that one... - The small silver thing... - This one? Small silver thingy. - Mmm-hmm. Yeah, right there. - Should've just said that. - Thanks. So did your dad let baby Tessa drive race cars, too? No. No, I had to wait till I was about five for that. All right, wise to wait. Oh. - Hi. - You did it, babel The show's sold out. The resort, too. Dad's thrilled. Oh, that's great. Freddy says you haven't cast Cinderella yet? No, not yet, but there's someone we're hoping is gonna accept It. Then make it happen, hot stuff. Anyway, got to fly. - Sorry. It's a lot going on. - It's okay. I'm in trouble if this girl doesn't show. You really think your mystery girl is that good? Oh, definitely, but Royal Resorts want us to complete casting today. Yeah, and if mystery girl doesn't come forward, then we have to pick someone else. I like spending time with you. I'd really like it If you'd meet me tomorrow, and maybe, well, you'd let me hold your spanner. Oh, my God! I thought he was gonna be, like, all abs and attitude, but he's so sweet. Someone's crushing hard. Oh, please! He's dating a gorgeous celebrity heiress. Who can't possibly hold a candle to you. She doesn't have to. She has people for that. It's okay. It's just the way things are. Yeah, I wish... What? Your dad, he made his dreams come true, right'? Yeah. Wouldn't he want you to do the same? I just hate to see perfectly good dreams go to waste. Okay, Dad, I'll be brave. Come on. How much longer is this going to take? - We got to get moving. - I don't know. - Where's the girl with the shoe? - I don't know. Look, she's not coming. Can we just pick someone? No, it's not midnight yet. Just a few more minutes. Stop it. Stop it! Stop it. So annoying. Unbelievable. Reed, if we don't pick someone, they'll cancel my show. Please? Fine. Am I too late? - That's her, right? - Yeah. - Hello. - Hello. Cherry blossoms were me mum's favorite flowers. Why did you run? I wasn't sure I should've auditioned at all. But you've changed your mind, right? You'll be my Cinderella? Yes. Hold on a second! Walt one minute! Hold on! Hold on! I have something to say! This girl, I bet she's not even a legitimate guest. What? That's absurd. Ah! "Absurd!" Of course I'm probably a guest. Well, what's your name? - My name? - Yes. Right, because everyone... Everyone has a name, right'? Spit it out. Mmm-hmm. Um... The... See, the name that my mother gave me was... Bella! Bella! - Bella Snow! - Bella Buckingham. - Bella Buckingham? - Bella Snow! It's Bella Buckingham Snow. Bella Snow for short. It's good to see you. I was just at your mom's castle... In Yorkshire Puddingshire. How lovely. Yup, Bella Snow, VIP. She's legit. - Thank you. - Okay, a fight. I'm on to you. You and your silly sneakers had better watch your step. Okay, then. Read this. Check out the links. Learn the routines. Start rehearsal In the morning. All right. No! No carbs for you. You're getting too fat. Here's the tablet you requested. Finally. Sit down. I want you to Google something. - Okay, what do you want me to Google? - Google Bella Snow. - Snow. - Bella Snow. Snow, like the stuff that falls from the sky. B-E-L... Just give that to me. Let me do it. - You're so slow. - You do it. She's too slow. Okay. Okay, here's one. "Bella Snow, uh, dentist In New Jersey." That's not her. That girl is as brainless as they come. Okay, I found a British Bella Snow who died 100 years ago. - Aw! - This is pointless. She doesn't exist. I knew it! She's an impostor. I want you to follow her after rehearsal and find out who she ls. Me? - Oh, I'll go, too. - Can I go? I'm gonna go make sure the chef has your suggestions for dinner, okay? All right, and, you know, I want the spritzing station by the cabana today. - Got it. - I love to be spritzed. Just go with what you're feeling at the time. - Don't decide beforehand. - All right. Just let it be whatever you're feeling In the moment, okay? - Yeah. - Cool. - Oh, good, you're here. Okay. - HI. So we want to do Cinderella's opening song. You're ready, right? Okay, great! Let's give her some space, folks! Right, this song's about a girl who lives a difficult life filled with loss, who struggles to find the courage to go after her dreams. Try and imagine what that might be like, okay? I can try. Okay, places everybody. We definitely found our girl. Okay. Seventeen. Arms up. up, up, up. - Sorry. Sorry. - Mmm. Oh, you've got a waist like a little hummingbird. - Okay. - Cheers. Bella. Georgie. Look at you, all princessy. For the first time, I feel like maybe I can do this, like for real. Hello. Argh! My God. My stepsisters are waiting to follow me outside. Go out the back. They won't expect it. - You sure? - Mmm-hmm. - Okay, I'm gonna go. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Where is she? Come on. Okay, you go that way. Got you! Oops. Who are you? - Got you! - Olympia! - Oh, it's such a delight to see you here. - It is'? Could you be so kind as to pass me that suntan lotion over there, dear? We Brits, we just crisp so easily. Oh, do you mind? I can't reach. Thank you. So, tell me, Olympia, was it hard to get all those scarves In your mouth? - Oh, I had to train my cheeks for weeks. - Did you? - Do you want to see? - Sure. That's a lot of grapes. Do you know what would be lovely? Some lemonade. - Hmm and snacks. - Yes, and snacks. - I can get them. - Oh, you could? - That's absolutely perfect. - Mmm-hmm. Okay. Thank you. I'll be just right here waiting. Right here. Won't move. She's so nice and smart. But then she disappeared before I could give her her snacks. You got played, Olympia. You're just jealous because Bella's head is prettier than yours. Where have you been? I was just picking up the dresses you ordered. Are these for the costume ball? We're going as Cinderellas. 'Lee-haw. Creative. Abracadabra! Just... That's what a magician says. So this is your wand. It's very simple to use. I'll just demonstrate for you. Ah, Gino, could you step Into Cinderella's position, please? Yeah. So all you do is... Twirl. See? It's so easy. Just a flick of the wrist. Here. Go ahead, uh, get a feel for it, and let me know If you have any questions. Sorry. This is ridiculous. What were you thinking getting Blanca and the stepsisters In the show? Olympia, stop it! Gross! We have no choice, all right? The VIP Package guarantees them supporting roles. Don't worry. It'll be fine. I can get a great performance out of anybody. These wings are so heavy. She's gonna be great. So it's four beats in the hips. All right? - Hello. - Oh, Bella is here, so let's rehearse the shoe-fitting scene, please. No. Yes, that's what we're gonna do. Freddy, can you run the show without me for a little bit? What? Why? Where are you going? To fix Cinderella's pumpkin carriage. Can't do the show without It, right? Ah... Guess I'll stand in. If Tessa is not there, he'll think she's a flake or doesn't care. You can't be in two places at once. Meet me in makeup with coveralls and a cap, okay? Okay. Tess, how are you going to pull this off? Great question. I think I'm going to get Reed started, then tell him I have to go, and then I'll just meet you back here with the Bella wig. You work your magic again with your magic makeup hands. - Okay. - Other shoe. Thanks. Okay. Ah... wig. okay- - You need a brush? - No, It's okay. I don't need a brush. Okay. Time to go. Okay. Ew, ew! Okay. Cap. - Here. Here you go. - Okay. Good? Okay. Bye-bye. Go! Go! Okay - Go! Oh, thank God. I thought you forgot. No, it just takes a little time to look this hot. Yeah? Sorry. I got those parts that you asked for. I don't know... Oh, wow. That's amazing. - That or Legos. - Um... Wow, I'm surprised you got these parts so quickly. Yeah, well, the perks of being a pop star. Must be nice. Not really. But nobody should have to listen to pop star problems. Like getting everything you could want, Including awesome bike parts? Yeah. Not exactly. Or like not being able to follow your heart, maybe? Ah... I heard those songs that you wrote for the musical. They're really good. Beautiful. Really? - Honestly? - Honestly. That's the real you, right? Freddy just thinks I need to stick to my brand until my career reaches the next level. Then I can do whatever I want. Freddy could be wrong. Yeah, it's just that he's been right about everything else. Hmm, like I said, pop star problems. Well, they're safe with me. Yeah, I believe they are. - Yeah, you're gonna need that. - Yeah. - Come on. - Uh, Oh... Just... Will you just tighten these bolts really quick, and finish putting on the belts, and I will be... I'll be right back. I've just got to check on... Are you gonna come back, though? I can't do this without you. Yes, of course. I'll be back. Bella! You're supposed to make a noise there. Am I too late to try on the slipper? Every maiden in the land is granted the opportunity. Could that be her? Ow! Could that be her? The lass that I have waited my whole life for? Come! Come! Please, present your foot. What? Your mole switched cheeks. It happens to all the Snow women. We just don't like to talk about It. Okay. Uh... Okay, yeah. Bring your foot up. Good. And... A perfect fit! Okay, and now we get up. We come up and get ready for the spin. I have found you, my princess, and you shall never wear rags again. Come. Come! Come on! Never fear. Your fairy godmother is here. Let others see you as I do. Twirl. - Twirl. - Come on. - Flick the wrist like I showed you. - Twirl! Ahhh. For crying out loud, people... Fix this, please! Now, let's take It from the top. Bella? Now where is she? So, you put the mole... Georgie? Okay, here we go. Ow! Georgie, what are you doing here? Well, Tessa, Reed was looking for you, so I offered to help. Oh, I can't believe I did that. Um, right. Right. I will, um... I, Tessa, will take it from here. Thank you, Georgie. You're welcome. - Hi. - HI. - Sorry. - You okay? You look a little bit flushed. - Sorry. - No, you're okay. Um... Have you seen Bella? She's AWOL! Uh, no, she'll be back. She promised not to disappear again. Yeah, right. So much for promises. Where was I? You know what? I think I... I just saw Bella, and I think I should probably just go check on her for Freddy... No, don't go, please. I've got to go and perform In a minute. Um, this will just take a second. Be right back. Okay. There you are! Divine! Hi. Oh, I know what you are doing. - You do? - Yes. - These eyes see everything. - They do? Hmm. Oh, I know you have your own little fantasies about being up on stage, but lurking around the VIP area, Cinderella, is just sad and, frankly, a little creepy. Right, yeah, of course. I'm so sorry. No more creepy. Understood. Oh, good. Now where are those gowns? - The gowns! - The gowns! Where are the gowns? Yes, I was just about to pick the gowns up, actually. You can come with, unless, of course, you don't want to be seen In, you know, the service area. Have them in the suite in five minutes. You need to help us get dressed. Yes, of course. Sorry I'm late. I had to find more contacts. That's okay. Is this almost over? No, now I need to be In three places at once. Now that's what I call star power. Twirl, girls. Twirl for Sparkles. - Oh, Tessa, I have something for you. - For me? I didn't forget you, Tessa. There you go. You can't go to a costume ball without a costume. Wow. - Thank you, Divine. - You're so welcome. All right, girls, let the dazzling begin! Stand up straight. Smile. Chest forward. Out of my way, big baby! There's a lot of Cinderellas here, but you girls look the best. Stand up straight, Olympia. Hello. On the behalf of the Halstons and Royal Lagoons Resorts, welcome to the VIP costume ball! - First, one little question. - What? Is anyone in this room ready to get loose? Okay, play the music! Interesting choice of costume. I'm a penguin. Yes, you are. Can you sneak away? Uh, so we can finish the bike. I'll waddle out somehow. - Tessa? - Yeah... My hair broke. You have to help me put It back together. Five minutes. How's Your mystery girl working out for you? She's talented, but she's flaky. Oh, I'm sure she has her reasons for that. Yeah. Maybe I just would prefer someone I can trust. Someone who's funny, likes to laugh, smart, of course, smarter than me, probably, who's amazingly cute and waddles. Um... I think that should do it. - You wanna try and start her up? - No, do the honors. Ah! You did it. We did it. We totally did it. What about Harper? There you are. You're supposed to be meeting with the Halstons right now! Uh, oh, yeah. Um, I lost track of time. Can you give me one minute? Oh, you need a minute? By all means, yeah, take all the... No, you can't have a minute! We don't keep the big money waiting, Reed. I'll call you later. Let's go. Let's go. Freddy. The Halstons. Um, will Harper be there? Yeah, she's flying out to surprise Reed. I arranged It. So they're together. Oh, Tessa. I know it must be a rush being around a guy like Reed. - He's about to become a huge star. - I could care less about that. Which is exactly why Harper is so right for him. Look, I don't know what Reed told you, but I'm pretty sure he's gonna propose by the end of the month. What? I'm sorry, Tessa, really. Sorry. How could I have been so stupid? I'm done. Done with the show. I'm done with Reed, and definitely clone with Bella Snow. The show can't go on without Bella. He's resourceful. He'll figure something out. Speaking of. Look, this is about you. Did you become Bella Snow to win a boy? No. - No, I became Bella Snow because I was... - You were following your dream. Freddy was a real wakeup call, Georgie. I'm a nobody with just enough talent to delude myself. Tessa it's your decision, but If you give up now, you'll always wonder to your dying day, what if? God, I miss you. I wish you were here, Dad. Well, not exactly here. Now, what would you do if you were me? - Very good. - Bravo. Well done. It's just... It's hard to be Cinderella when I know my Prince Charming is in love with someone else. Get a grip, and focus on what's important. Yeah, you're right. Go back out there, and show them who you are, okay? - Okay. - Let's go. Let's go. Okay. Do you get what's going on? - No. - Ugh! That's right. We're mean. We don't like you. You're horrible. Ah. Georgie? Georgie? Divine. Cheerio, Bella. I knew you smelled like cookies. Did you really think you could get away with this'? Athena has the blood of a star running through her veins, and she will take her rightful place. Divine, please don't do this. "Please don't do this, Divine." Toodle-oo. Divine, no. No, no, no! Divine, please! Divine, please! Can someone hear me? Come on, think, Tessa. Think. Georgie, is Tessa all right? She's not answering my calls or texts. If you really care, why don't you ask Freddy? - She's the one. - But how do we find her, My Prince? We must search the land to find the lovely Malden whose delicate foot fits this glass slipper. Why isn't Bella in position? I don't know. I've been waiting to dress her In... Where's her costume? Oh. Ah. What is wrong with you? Why are you so fat? - Mom! - Let me try. - Uh-uh. Olympia, keep watch! - Momma... Put your arms through the thing! Put your arms through! Why can't I be Cinderella? Because, Olympia, you're just not good enough. - Mom, wait. - Your arms. Come on! - Wait. Mom! - What? Who's gonna play my part? Welcome to our humble home. His Highness requests the presence of all the ladles of the house. My two daughters and I are... Where's your sister, dear? Who cares? Maybe, she's dead! No, I remember. She's in her room. Silly me! How could I forget? I meant she's far, far away in Detroit. Hold on! Hold on! Here I am, Mother! - .Just keep going, and find Bella! - How could I stay In Detroit when it's Royal Try On a Glass Shoe day! Why waste your princely time on ground beef when you could have filet mignon? Don't be afraid. I don't bite. Well, maybe a little bit here and there. Actually, I'm just all cuddles. Go ahead. Ask my sister. - That doesn't appear to be an option. - Uh? What is happening out there? I'll show Mom I'm good enough! Stop it! Stop! Give me that! Stop it! You're ruining everything! You evil girl! Come back here! - Alas, it does not fit. - Are you sure, Prince? Really, really sure. Cram it in! I don't care! No! Just do it! Excuse me. I must go feed the horses. Hello, buddy. Okay, so I'm kind of In a situation right now. You've got to tell me which way to go, sugar. That way or this way? Oh. Okay, here we go. No, I don't care. We're not gonna stop the show. - Freddy - No... Just do It. Do It! What are you doing? I need you out there. - First tell me what you said to Tessa. - Tessa? Reed, the show's a mess. I can't find Bella... - Stop it! - What're they doing? - I don't know. I don't care. - This is Important! There you are, Prince dear. Get out here, or I will cut you! - What did you say to her? Just tell me. - Go! Out. No. No, no, no. Right, if there are no other ladies in the house, then we must take our leave. Unless... Hark! Do you hear something? Um... Maybe? I'm sure I must have heard a noise! Oh, you're stepping on me! Ow. Ow. Really? Am I too late to try on the slipper? Ow! Oh. Hello. Am I too late to try on the slipper? No! Am I too late to try on the slipper? Oh, my God! What has gotten into you? Stop It! No, no, no! I'm not going back out until you tell me what you said to Tessa. No! It's my shoe! I'm a princess! I'm a princess! Girls, you're not acting like ladies! Let me go! Okay, I may have said something about you and Harper getting engaged. That's all. Oh. Why, Freddy? Why would you say that to Tessa? Guys! Guys! Cover your mic! All right, everybody! Get ready for the new Cinderella! You're on the verge of stardom. Reed, I did It for you. Look, I know you mean well, Freddy, but you do not get to make those calls for me! Harper's just a friend. I don't like her that way. No! Tessa, I mean she's sweet, but what's the big deal? The big deal is, for the first time In my life, I think I'm In love. Oh. Bella. Am I too late to try on the slipper? Tessa. You're Cinderella? I'm sorry I didn't tell you who I really was. I never thought that a prince like you could ever love a girl like me. Not as sorry as I am to have caused you any pain. My adviser, Frederico, spoke not the truth of my Impending nuptials. Freddy totally lied about me getting married to Harper. I heard. Sound travels quite well in this kingdom. Please, try on the glass slipper. I'd love to. You know what, I don't need a shoe to tell me what I really feel In my heart. You're the one. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop It! You're disgusting! Never fear. Your fairy godmother is here. Let the world see you as I do. Twirl. Whoa! Yes! Come on! Your fairy godmother does great work. She really does. - Call me. - Thank you. - That was incredible. - HI. - I'm so proud of you. - Georgie, I don't know how to thank you. You don't have to. I thought you might need this. You're the best. What would I do without you? Sorry, buddy. I messed up. If you don't want me to be your manager anymore, I'll understand. No, of course I do. Plus, you may even get the chance to work with a talented new star. Hey, Charming, let's bounce. Tessa! Sweetie, we did it! I know I can't take all the credit, but it certainly wouldn't have happened without me, right'? Divine, you've been the best evil stepmother a girl could ever ask for but... Thank you. I think it's definitely time for us to part ways. Call me! So, where do you wanna go? Everywhere. At some point, we all come across an exciting opportunity, a new path that might scare us. My advice. Pop the clutch, pick the road, and make your happily ever after come true. Sorry. English - SDH
