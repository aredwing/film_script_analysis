Thousands of police officers are involved in a hunt for the people who tried to bomb the London underground and a bus, among them armed officers who have been told they can now shoot on sight suspected suicide bombers. Train is due in one minute. Suspect is preparing to board. Blooming hell. Repeat. Suspect is preparing to board. Should I detain? Request instructions. Hold position. Go commander. She's bull dog. Suspect is about to board a crowded commuter train. I need instruction. I need it five blooming minutes ago. Please respond. Sir? Tell them... Tell them to keep him off the tube. Deadly force is authorised. Bulldog. This is Operations. You are clear to go. Deadly force is authorised. Repeat. Deadly force is authorised. Police, open the gate. Police, move. Police, get out of the way. Move. Police. Move. Police, move it, move. Get out of the way. Move. That way. Move. Police, move out of the way. Move, Police. Police. Get out of the way, Police. Get out the way, move. That's him. Get down. Get down. Armed police. Put your hands above your head. Drop to your knees. Do it. Hands above your head. Now. Don't. Okay. Okay, good. Where is it? Here. What's this? Mp3. It's a music player, like a walkman, sir. I know what it is. I do have grandchildren. What a mess. Begging your pardon, sir, but I don't see that it is a mess. Really? Open your eyes. What does that tell you? Bloody media. Never there when we do something right. Meaning we're in the wrong this time? No, sir. Slip of the tongue. What do we know for certain? The suspect, Baqir Hassan emerged from the residence we were surveying. We had intelligence that terrorist activity - was being conducted there. - Intelligence? An anonymous tip was called in. Can we trace the call? We're trying, but they don't exactly leave their details. What they could, they did on him. Commander. Any minute now, I will be getting a call from our new Commissioner of Police and I will have to inform him that only six weeks into his administration we've already managed to lay a huge career-destroying scandal on his doorstep. Perhaps, levity is not in your best interest at this moment. Sir, sorry. This, D.I. Marber, is it? What does he have to say? The suspect didn't respond to a lawful order to surrender. Because he couldn't hear it? Or he willingly chose to ignore it? Who's to say? The I.P.C.C. I would imagine. With all due respect, sir. D.I. Marber and his officers followed policy to the letter. They did. And now it looks as if Scotland Yard has declared war upon innocent civilians. If you wanted us... Do you have evidence to the contrary? Oh, he was a Muslim. Being a Muslim isn't a crime, Commander. Not yet, anyway. - Yes? - Commissioner on the line for you, sir. I will be with him right away. What are you going to tell him? The truth. That we're not very sure at this point. You can show yourself out. John, the Commissioner is keeping a close eye on us. He's made it clear he wants things sorted quickly. Or someone in this office will pay the price. And I can assure you, it will not be me. Sir. Commissioner, I have it right here. Yes, sir. I agree. I think we've found our man. Beg your pardon, sir. They are waiting for you upstairs. - Well, Tariq. - Morning. Are you okay about this? I will give it my best. I expect nothing less. Morning, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning. My name is Tariq Ali and first I will read from a prepared statement and after that I will take the questions. At approximately armed police fired upon a suspected suicide bomber as he attempted to board a north-bound train at Charing Cross tube station. No officers or bystanders were injured, but the suspect - Baqir Hassan. - Could you spell that please? B- A-Q-I-R H-A-S-S-A-N. Baqir Hassan was killed after he refused to comply with a lawful order to surrender. The investigation is currently ongoing and more information will be made available to you at a later date. Thank you. Sir? Sir? Declan Quinn, from The Informer. Is it true that the suspect had ties to Al Qaeda? There is no evidence to support that as yet, but we are definitely not ruling out anything at this juncture. John Clark, Five News. Several witnesses from the station stated that the victim did not respond to police commands because he was unable to hear them? As I said before, the investigation is ongoing. - Yes, miss? - Pamela Davis, News Daily. What do you say to the victim's mother's claim that her son wasn't a terrorist, but was a victim of institutional racism by the police? Every mother would like to believe the best of her own child. However, all our hearts do go out to her at this time. The fact that the suspect was Muslim played no part in his being targeted? We are waging war on terrorists, Miss. That is who we are targeting. But, he was a Muslim. As am I, Miss Davies. Is it your contention that all Muslims are terrorists? - Obviously not. - What does that mean? What does that mean? Ladies and gentlemen, that will be all for today. The liaison officer will have printed copies of the statement for all of you. Thank you for coming. Very impressive, Commander. I dare say I couldn't have done better myself. High praise, indeed. Here you are, Isabi, the fresh stock. Enjoy cooking. See you next time. Thank you, bhai jaan (dear brother). You, again? Listen, officer. This is harassment. Don't you have anything better to do, then trouble an honest shopkeeper? You call these prices honest? Officer, can I please offer you something? Some masala chai (spiced tea). - Assalum aleikum - Aleikum. You know, Rabiya gets our favourite chai masala from Lahore. Bade Miyan? - Bade Miyan. - Oh, no wonder. I saw the press conference. Hmm-huh. And? Come on. I thought it went quite well. Who's heading the investigation? No officials announcements, yet. Commander sahib (sir), there are no blooming cameras here. I'm sorry. I really don't know. The brass on the top floor don't believe in sharing their thoughts with a lowly Commander. Especially, a Muslim one. Yunus, I'm having a good day, don't ruin it. I'm going to run. It's dinner time. Oh, don't forget the special meat for begum sahib (wife). Hey, bless you. - Hi. - Dad. Oh, hey. Hey. You're gettin' heavy. Gonna have to stop feeding you so much. Is it okay if I have dinner at Zaheer's tonight? That's okay. Where is mom? All right, off you go. Brilliant. Hey, hey, champ. You're forgetting something. - Thanks, Dad. - Bye. Dinner will be ready in half an hour. What are you cooking? Koftahs (meatballs). Oh, great. Smells divine. Got some mutton. Oh? Put it in the fridge, would you? All righty. Where is Zara? She's at Vrinda's. You promised she could stay over. Oh, yes. Of course, a house free of children. Does that give you any ideas? We'll have to be quick. My husband's coming home soon and he's a policeman. Oh... you're worth the risk. Oh, there's a letter for you. I think it's from papa. This one? Huh? Zaheer is coming here the day after tomorrow. Look at you, the proud uncle. My nephew, the engineer. I like the sound of that. Hello. Yeah. Where's she now? Oh, all right. All right. I'll be right over. I'll be right over. What is it? Can I help you, sir? - Yeah... - It's okay. Ruby. Thank you for calling. Sorry about the hour, sir. No, I should be the one apologising. Follow me. Rave parties. Different location every night usually. Abandoned buildings or vacant lots. It's very big with teenagers right now. They think it's retro. Anyway, somebody called to complain about the noise and we managed to grab a few of them before... - they did a runner. - Drugs? Yes. Little marijuana, some ecstasy. Yeah. If it's any consolation, she does seem very, very sorry. So am I. I was here when they brought her in. No one else knows who she is. No reason they should. I appreciate that, Ruby. Where did you think she was? Sleeping over at a friend's place. Classics never go out of style, do they? Does mum know? Great. I'm sorry, Zara. But I can't lie to mum with the same ease as you can, yeah. It was just a party. It's not like I killed someone. Just a party? Just look at the way you're dressed. Who else was at this party? You expect me to tell on my friends as if it isn't bad enough having a cop for a dad. Was that guy Shawn there? Hmm? Was Shawn there? Look, Zara. We've talked about this. You are not to see that guy again. You are not to see that guy again! Why? You are much too young to have a serious boyfriend. Are you joking? In fact, some girls... - are married at my age. - Come on, Zara. We both know the real reason why you don't like it. I have no idea what you talking about. So then tell me this then, dad. Would you be so up in arms about me dating if my boyfriend was named Salman. You're grounded. All right? Four weeks. You're grounded four weeks. No phone. No television. No computers, except for homework. And you are coming straight home from school. Four weeks! That's so unfair. Unfair. You want to talk about unfair? Do you realise what this could have meant for me? Can you see the headlines? Police Commander's daughter arrested in drugs raid. That would have been great for my career, wouldn't it? Sure, because it's always about you dad, isn't it? Our daughter hates me. If that were true, she wouldn't try so hard to get your attention. Tariq, I was wondering... Oh, I didn't know. I'll come back. Yes, sir? Apologies, there was no one on reception. My door is always open to you, sir. Please, Daniel will do just fine. Oh, all right. Daniel. I'm on my way out for a walk. I was wondering if you'd care to join me? No. I promised Susan, I'd quit. My wife thinks I quit a year ago, so I change out of uniform before going home so she won't notice the smell. You sure, I can't. No. I lack your skills at subterfuge. I sometimes find a little white lie less harmful than harsh reality. The media are having a real go over this incident. You know what they'd print if we allowed a suspect to walk onto a crowded train and detonate a device. M.E.T. fails to prevent attack. Damned if we do, doubly so if we don't. When will the I.P.C.C. submit its report? Who knows? Months, weeks. The wheels of bureaucracy turn very slowly. We just have to weather the storm then, won't we? Tariq, we can't stand idle and let the media vultures villify us in the public eye. The Commissioner and I have decided to task our own internal inquiry. I need someone who is not directly involved with bulldog and someone to liaise with the I.P.C.C., go through the case evidence interview the family, make sure there were no blunders on our part and if there were, make doubly sure that those responsible are held accountable. Me? Exactly. I am certain that your findings will not be coloured by any misguided loyalties. And it doesn't hurt to have a Muslim investigating officer does it? The thought never occurred to me. If I agree to do this, I'll need an assistant, an officer of my choosing. Whatever you need. There's something else. I've heard a rumour that Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cole might be retiring soon? You're very well informed. Requirements in a senior officer even more so than a Deputy Assistant Commissioner of police don't you I think. When I was a young constable you could wander all over this park and never see a single non-caucasian face. Britain has changed. I like to think for the better. We need to reflect that. We need officers who understand the complexities of a multi-cultural Britain. We need officers like you. Bring me a favourable result to this inquiry and I have a strong feeling this department is going to see its first Asian Deputy Assistant Commissioner. I don't know if I'll recognise him. I saw him last when he was just a child. That could be him there. The backpack the guy with the backpack. Hey, Zaheer. Mamu (Uncle). Oh, that is him all right. Excuse me. Uncle. Welcome to London, beta (son). Thank you. You're looking just like your mum. I hope not, for her sake. Your Mami (Aunty). Mami. Assalum aleikum (peace be upon you). Aleikum assalum (and upon you too). Mashallah (Wow), your pictures don't do you justice. Oh, what a charmer. It's very nice to meet you. Same here. - Oh, Mamu (uncle). You shouldn't. - Oh. Come on, pal. Is this your first time abroad, Zaheer? No, I went to Saudi Arabia last year for my Umrah (Festival). Oh, I would have loved to have gone to Mecca during my backpacking years. My dear, I told you they wouldn't even allow you in there. Why not? What? I'm not a Muslim. You should have listened to me when I told you to convert. Oh, shut up. Don't start that again. Dekha bhi (see), never marry a gori (white girl). Oh, God. Mamu, thank you once again for your recommendation letters. It's all right, beta (son). I don't know how you did it. You are a miracle worker. Yes, I am. Though, your Mami (aunt) might not agree. But just concentrate on your studies, get your degree that will be all the thanks I need. And in sports news. Footballer and underwear model Carlos Vieira can now add best-selling author to his list of achievements. His autobiography 'My Night on the Ball' debuted on the London booksellers' charts this week. The beloved, tall and athletic midfielder will be doing a book signing tour in support of the tour beginning at the Galleria shopping centre on the 24th of July. Yes. '... on the outside in towards Kuka coming in here' 'and the ball is... ' 'The fact that Lesotto has felt it at one end. Perhaps... ' Zara, they're back. It's lovely. - Oh, Mamu. Give it to me. - Oh, not a problem at all. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you, Mamu. It's not large, but... No, it's perfect. Mashallah. Well, make yourself at home. Thank you. Ever heard of knocking? I did. Mind coming down to meet your cousin? I'm grounded, remember? "Straight to school, straight to my room, no exceptions. " Your words, not mine. Dinner will be ready in half an hour. See you there. Yes, Commander. Aleikum assalum. Good morning, sir. You've heard? Lieutenant's poster-boy is leading the investigation. That bum has cut me completely out of the loop. He's going to put all this on our shoulders. We followed protocol. Oh, wake up, man. Nobody cares. This isn't about protocol. It's about politics. Somebody's head is going to hit the chopping block to sate the public. You mark my word. Well, just have to keep an eye on him then, won't we? And how do we do that? Crystal ball? I guess, you didn't hear the full story. The Commander has acquired himself a little helper. You must be hungry. I know an excellent kebab wallah (vendor) close by. Come on. Why do you insist on rotting your insides with that rubbish. Rabya, you're such a good cook. Oh, well, one man's rubbish is another man's cuisine. Still thinking with your stomach, Yunus? Well, it rarely leads me astray. Assalum aleikum. Aleikum assalum, sir. Tariq, you are looking well. Thank you, Junaid miya (brother). But you're a bit far away from your own pack. What happened? Did you overstay your welcome in your own mosque? On the contrary, I am now it's Imam (leader). You should visit us on Friday. It's not as fancy as this but still, a place of worship. Saw you on telly. New spokesperson of the police department. You must be so proud. - Shall we? - Yes. Who have we here? Oh, this is my nephew, Zaheer, Ismat appa's (sister) son. This is Juniad miya, Tariq and I know him from Lahore. Assalum aleikum. Aleikum assalum, young man. Mashallah. The last I saw you you were crawling on your mother's floor. And look at you now. How are you finding London so far? A bit intimidating. Don't worry puttar (son), everything is going to be fine. Come. We have a study group that meets every Sunday. A bit out of the way for you, but it might be a good way for you to make new friends. Zaheer, I'm running late for an appointment. Yes, Uncle. I appreciate the offer, but I have a lot on my plate. Khuda Hafiz (good bye). Khuda Hafiz. If you change your mind, our doors are always open. Darn shoe thief. Remember, he was caught stealing shoes at Badshah-Id mosque in Lahore? My brother was not a terrorist. He only moved to London six months ago. He was going to be an artist. You know, if he met anyone recently in college. Someone who might have been suspicious? He didn't have time for friends. He studied all week, then came home on weekends to help with the store. Oh, this is total bollocks. Baqir was never a suicide bomber and you know it. You're just here trying to cover your own backs. Look, I assure you. We're only trying to find out the truth. Sure. Well, excuse me. This interview is terminated. And you are? Fiona Monroe. I represent the Hassan family. Any questions for them in the future go through me or my office or in an interview at the police station. Hold on. No one is being investigated here. Perhaps, someone should be. My clients are the victims here. I don't want to be badgered or harassed by your department. Look, we're not adversaries. We both want the same thing here. I sincerely doubt that. Goodbye, officers. I'll see you in court. What a lovely woman. Praise the Lord. For hundreds of years, the star of Islam is shining in the world because of khilafa (caliphate). Brothers, the establishment of khilafa is an Islamic duty. But khilafa means imposing shariat (Koran's code of law) on everyone. What if we live in a non-Muslim democracy? No, brother. Khilafa as a duty is confirmed in the Koran. The sunnah (trodden path) of the prophet peace be upon him, the consensus of the shaba (code of conduct) and shariat principle and it's your duty to change this system of the khafa. What's your name, brother? - Abdullah. - Alhamdalila. What's Abdullah? Abdullah means slave of Allah. Subanatallah. Now, can a Muslim subscribe to any of the freedoms mentioned in a democratic charter and be a Muslim in the true sense? No. No, my brother. A slave of Allah cannot serve two masters. Join our study circle. Serve the cause of Allah. Welcome all. You have grown again. Look at you. Hello, darling. Tariq. Hello. That's my nephew Zaheer. - Hello. - Please come in. How lovely you all look. And you get bigger every week. Come in. Come in. Everyone's in the garden. 'Happy birthday to you. ' 'Happy birthday to you'. Yeah. He's a handsome young man. Like uncle, like nephew. Makes a nice pair with Zara. Perhaps, there will be wedding bells in the family soon. Yeah, but they're first cousins, aren't they? So are Yunus and I. It is acceptable in our culture. As a matter of fact, it's even preferred. Excuse me. Was it something I said? I say, deport them all. The faster, the better. I have to say I'm shocked to hear you say that, Yunus. Every time someone like Abu Hamsa or Sheikh Omar Bahkri appear in front of television camera, things become worse for my family, for my business. They just open their mouth, half of England thinks that they speak for all the Muslims. I mean, you should see some of the things spray-painted outside my store. Who needs the aggravations? I think your son has dreams of being the next Beckham, Mamu. That's good. He can support me in my old age. What do you make of this radical Imam situation, Zaheer? Yunus seems to think, we should deport them all. Let them be somebody else's problem. I don't really know much about it, sir. Well, you read the newspapers. You must have some opinion. Well, I think there is a fine line between being a terrorist and a freedom fighter. Rubbish. They preach hatred and violence. There is nothing honourable about them. It wasn't long ago before Nelson Mandela was called a terrorist and then Menachem Begin he was a part of Irgun, the group identified by the Brits as a terrorist outfit. And then later, when he became a Prime Minister he was called a peacemaker. Okay, two exceptions don't make a rule. I guess that depends on who is making the rules. Come on, come on. What are we getting so serious about? I thought this was a birthday party. Yeah. Sorry, Mamu, I meant no offence. Never apologise for your opinions, my boy. Leave that to the politicians. And to the police Commanders. Assalum aleikum, brother Abdullah. Brothers, repeat after me. In the name of Allah, most gracious, most merciful. In the name of Allah, most gracious, most merciful. Peace. Assalum aleikum, brothers. Aleikum assalum. I am so happy to see you all here. Brothers before I say anything, I urge you to ask me a question which you yourself find difficult to answer. Brother Abdullah. A movement to create khilafa will lead to bloodshed. Innocent people are going to die and Islam does not condone the killings of innocent people. So how do we achieve khilafa without violence? Brother, you are right. Islam does not teach killing innocent people. So now tell me, who is innocent and who is not? Those who kill Palestinian men, women and children are they innocent? No. Those who invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, Chechnya and killed thousands of Muslims in their own backyards. Are they innocent? No. Those who throw cluster bombs on unarmed civilians those who use tanks and bulldozers against pregnant women and children. - Are they innocent? - No. Those who despise you because you are Muslims. Those who deny you equality, jobs, visas because of your religion. Are they innocent? No. If they are not innocent, if they are perpetrators or allies of the perpetrators, then they are at war with you. And you are at war with them, brothers. Allah o akbar (Allah is the greatest). Allah o akbar. Zaheer, I... Oh, I'm sorry to disturb you. I was hoping you might do me a big favour. How can I help? Well, I have to pop out to the shops and do various things and I was wondering if you wouldn't mind picking up Imran from football practice, Sure, Mami. Not a problem. Thank you. All right, darling. Should we have a word? No. Let's just do what we came here for. Say cheese. Don't get involved in anything you don't have to. Yeah. But... Just don't get involved in anything. Oh, hell. How do you stand it? Few more years and you won't even notice. Smell like morning on the hay. Not bloody likely. It's not another domestic, is it? Complaint of loud noises and strange odour coming from the third floor flat. How would you notice? Right. Smell anything? Only your aftershave. Pat the paint brush, did you? Oh, cheeky witch. Just for that you get to knock. Yeah? Police, sir. Can we have a word? Police! Open the door, now! Yeah? P.C. Andrews. This is P.C. Miller. We've had a complaint about a strange odour. Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. It must've been spicy food. Anyone else in the flat, sir? No. No one else. Yeah. I thought I heard voices. It's just the telly. Look, I'm sorry, but I've got something on the stove. So, can I just... Hey, who's that? On the floor. I've got him. Check the other room. Go. Hey, Stop! Bollocks. There's another one. Jumped out the blooming window. Must an acrobat or something. I swear. All right. Just check the kitchen. Darn! - Good evening. - Good evening. Hello. - Hey. - Hi. Gang's all here. Yeah. Hello. Maybe I should call home and check if the kids are all right. Oh, relax, Susan. They'll be fine. Last time you said that, you spent the night bailing out our daughter from the lock up. Zaheer is there. He'll look after them. Here's my boss. Smile. And his lovely wife. Susan. Hello, how are you? How long has it been? Tariq. How was your trip up north? Go on, shop talk. Come on. Let's mingle. Two glasses of champagne, you can't take her anywhere. So, the interview... Sure. The family have retained a lawyer. Nothing surprising there. Her name's Fiona Monroe and she is trouble. Most women are. Sir. No, thank you. - No. - Why not? We're in your mum's car outside my parents' house where I'm supposed to be babysitting. What else do you need? What about my room? My mum's passed out. I'm not ready. Be patient. But that's what you said last month and the month before. You're such a wanker sometimes. Wait, wait. I'm sorry, okay? It wasn't me. It was the other part talking. You know I love you, right? Forgive me. Right? Still a wanker. Yeah, well, whose fault's that? Ew, Mark. A little after your curfew, isn't it, Mr? Sorry, ma'am. It won't happen again. See that it doesn't. By the way, I... I think you missed a few buttons. Bugger. Look at that. He's got his head so far up the Deputy's behind, I'm surprised he can still breathe. You're jealous. Any word on the interview with the family? I should know something tomorrow. See that you do. Sure, retard. Daniel, could I have a word? John, I'm in a bit of a hurry. I was hoping we might discuss the Deputy Assistant Commissioner post. Come on, now. This is neither the time nor the place. Susan, we got a serious problem. I have to go. You'll be all right? Don't worry about me. Go. Sir, we're required at headquarters immediately. Suspected terrorist activity. One arrest. Darling, there's a situation that requires my presence elsewhere. I'll send the driver to take you back home. Good night. John. Harry. He doesn't even look worried. As if he's waiting for a bus. Well, you've really stepped in it this time, Aziz. Until now, it's just been little stuff. A little bit of benefit fraud. A bit of petty theft. And now look at you. All grown up from playing the proper villain. A regular Osama in the making. I believe the suspect finds me funny, Diesco. I believe you're right, sir. Is that it, Aziz? What do you think I'm funny? Well, you'll find this hysterical then. Know what the sentence is for committing an act of terrorism on British soil? Life imprisonment, no parole. Should get out just in time to collect your pension. That is, of course, unless we pack you up and ship you back to rugged land. I've got a bad idea, actually. Why should we have the expense of putting you up? Maybe, we should just give you to the Americans. I've been there, you know. Guantanamo. I went to interview this bloke student. Got himself arrested as a suspected terrorist. Said he was a British citizen, supposedly lost his passport. The poor boy was in tears practically the entire interview. Told me how the guards used to make him stand on one leg for 13 hours straight. And if he fell over he had to start all over again. The look on his face when I told him there was nothing I could do. He got down on his knees and he begged me to kill him. Can you imagine that? Do you imagine being so frightened of a place that you'd rather die than live there another day? I couldn't. How about you? It doesn't have to be that way Aziz. Help us and we can help you. Look, we know there was another man there. Help us find him and I give you my word. I will do what I can for you. It's all right. Please. God will strike down upon his disloyal subjects. Death to the enemies of Islam. Darn. I thought we had him. Oh, Tariq. What's wrong? It's starting again. Good morning, ladies and gentleman. On behalf of the Hassan family I would like to make a statement to the press. The department is yet to produce any credible evidence that Mr. Hassan is linked to any terrorist activity. As such, my clients are going forward with the wrongful death claim against the London Police and in particular, the officers in charge of the operation. Azan Hassan lost her son... due to inept handling of this incident. And rightly, well, someone should be accountable. But why now? Why not wait for the independent police complaints commission report? My clients remain dubious about the report or the accuracy of its findings. They prefer to let the court decide. My brother was no terrorist. He was murdered because he was Muslim. He was... That will be all. Mrs. Hassan... Can you tell me, why do you think... Oh, blooming hell. Are you okay? No, Susan, I'm not. This... I have to go. What's the matter? Oh, nothing. Aren't you going to be late? I didn't sleep very well last night. Oh, dear. Here. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikum Assalam. What's happened? Oh, I fell and twisted my ankle. Well, is it serious? Do you want to see a doctor? No, it'll be fine. So, how did it go last night? Everyone on their best behaviour? Yeah. It was fine. Good. This is blooming hopeless. Oh, come on. We've only got 62 hours left to watch. Bring me a tub of French Vanilla and some biscuits it will be like my last day off. I hope I'm not interrupting. Sorry, sir. Could you give us a moment please, constable. Yes, sir. So, how's it coming? A few more eyes wouldn't hurt. Listen, I'm sorry if I offended you with that 'shipping back to rugged land' remark in the interview. I was just trying to get a rise. It's okay. But he is from Yorkshire. I understand you were with Commander Ali... when he spoke with the suspect's family. Baqir Hassan, yeah, we... We spoke to his mother and sister. About what in particular? Well, it wouldn't be proper for me to discuss that with you, sir. You've heard about the claim? Yes, sir. Strange timing that. The way they came up with the idea straight after your little visit. I don't know what you mean, sir. I'm sure you don't. Gotcha. - She was all over me. - Bollocks. I practically had to fight her off. It was sore for like two days. What was it like? Really brilliant. She really knew what she was doing, yeah? All Muslim girls have to wait for marriage. Yeah, well they're not supposed to eat pork either. Didn't stop her swallowing my sausage. Zara. So, what was that, then? Foreplay? That far? About there. It's about here. No? A little further, Ruby. Here? Yeah, that's about right. What do you reckon, officer? That's right, sir. You must be quite a marksman. Haven't had any complaints, till now, laddy. You identify yourself as a police officer? No, as a postman. Yes, sir. Could you excuse us for a minute please, officer? You don't like me much, do you, Inspector? On the contrary. I have a deep respect for your position, sir. It's not really the same thing. So, the train was arriving, it was rush hour. People pushing, shoving, talking. Didn't it occur to you that perhaps the boy couldn't hear you? Police, put your hands above your heads and drop to your knees. Do it. It's all right. It's all right, folks. Sorry about that. Did you have any trouble hearing me, Commander? I have to say, I don't like your attitude, D.I. Marber. I don't like being second guessed, sir. The suspect turned and looked me right in the eye. He saw the gun and he reached his hand into his jacket. I saw wires protruding. I had a second, maybe less, to make a judgement call. In the same situation, I would make it again. I'm sure you would. How is the view from the moral high-ground, Commander? Any skeletons in your cupboard? Perhaps, sponsorship letters to a family member. Issued on an official letterhead? Ruby, would you mind getting the car around? Sure. You listen to me. You killed a man here. A young Muslim boy, not much older than my nephew. Right now, I am the only thing that stands between you and the R.B.C.C. Perhaps, you should dispense with the attitude, yeah? I was following orders. I've heard that rationale before. I wonder if you'd been so quick to pull the trigger if his skin hadn't been brown. You think I'm racist. Yes, I do. No. No, Commander. I'm a realist. Remember you're little press conference? And you gave that reporter a dressing-down for intimating that all Muslims are terrorists. You see the thing is she was only half-wrong. And the question isn't, are all Muslims, terrorists? It's, are all terrorists, Muslim? And I think we both know the answer to that. Praise the Lord. In the name of Allah, the compassionate, the merciful. Now it has become a routine, that every Friday we mourn the deaths of thousands of innocent Muslims killed by American, Israeli and British forces who have no business to occupy our lands. Shame on us. We meet here, offer salat (prayers) mourn the deaths and forget everything the very next day. Shame on you, all Muslims of this land and other lands. It pains me to refer to the events of the recent days following the declaration of war against the Ummah (community). The Muslims in Iraq, the Muslims in Afghanistan the Muslims in Lebanon, the Muslims in Gaza the Muslims in Chechnya, the Muslims in Kashmir and where not. They have declared a war over our possessions, our mosques our men, our women, and our children and our dignity. The deviant enemies of Islam have undertaken a new phase of committing atrocities against our brothers and sisters. Their masks have come off. Their plans have been revealed. But the wounded body of crusaders has also become feeble. And their collapse is inevitable. Brothers, we must unite and take revenge. If it means laying down our lives, so be it. Allah o Akbar. Allah o Akbar. Allah o Akbar. Allah o Akbar. - Allah o Akbar. - Allah o Akbar. Allah o Akbar. Has he gone mad? I don't believe this. It's because of people like him we have to suffer. Tariq, you people seem to be in a hurry. I thought I might have missed you. Listen, Junaid. Perhaps this is not the right time. It won't take a minute. It's about the Hassan inquiry. Who are you? Sorry? Who are you? The boy I grew up with would never spout such bigotry, such hatred. I would be well within the law to arrest you right here, and now. Always the policeman. You'll have me beaten as well? Mamu, please. This is not the way. They're only words. Words? This is poison. What matters is how we interpret them. Listen to him, Tariq. He speaks the truth. I'm sorry if you people found my speech offensive. It was not my intent. Forgive me. Mamu, please. Please. It's me. I think I have something you're gonna want to see. Imran! Imran! Laces. Come here. Nervous? Sort of. Don't be. You'll be fine. Just watch. Everyone's bigger than me. It's not about size. It's about speed. Remember what I taught you. Go for it. Come on, Imran. All right. What's the matter with you two? Come on, cheer up. You're supposed to be supporting Imran. Come on, Imran. Where are you going? Toilet. Well, hurry up or you'll miss him. Come on. Ball away. Why haven't you returned any of my calls? Three guesses and the first two don't count. Look. I said I was sorry, all right. I just didn't want to look like a coward. What? And make me look like a prostitute. Whatever. It's done. We're over. - Ow! - I just wanna talk to you, all right? - You're hurting me. - Why are you being such a witch? Let her go. Who are you, then, eh? He's my cousin. Yeah, piss off, mate. It doesn't concern you. I said, "Let her go. " Darn you. Are you okay? I'm fine. Let's go. Deputy Commissioner Tennant's office. Well, it looks in order to me. Am I missing something? This is the tape of the anonymous caller who phoned in the tip. Listen, they're up to something. They're coming. Going. Do it now. Have to check it out. The address. 16, Mill Lane Garden. Did you hear that? Tariq, I am very busy. I have a meeting in a few minutes. Look, it won't take a second. Just listen to it. The address. 16 Mill Lane Garden. Did he say Mill Lane Gardens? The wrong address. Blooming hell. - Who else knows? - No one. Let's keep it that way. I need to talk to the Commissioner. I'll take that. His name is Junaid. He's been on special branch's watch-list for about a year. Only he and Ali are friends. You see what I see. Our esteemed Commander shaking hands with a known Muslim extremist. It's hardly a smoking gun. Depends where you're aiming. For example, if some nosy reporter were to get hold of him. Can I get you another? I am very particular about who I drink with. Oh, flattery will get you everywhere. Hold the presses. Bismillah (in the name of Allah). Assalum aleikum. Aleikum assalum, Yunus brother. I want two. - You want two sheep. - Yeah, that's right. Hey, mate. Hello. Tariq, have you see the News Daily today? I wouldn't use that rag to wrap your meat. I suggest you have a look. Have you any idea how this happened? I have my suspicions. It won't do, Commander. It won't do at all. I have known Junaid since I was a child but we're barely on speaking terms any more. Nevertheless, the Commissioner feels and I agree, it might be best if you took some time off. A holiday. You look as if you can use it. And after this blows over. We'll perhaps look again at your request for promotion. Please give my best to Susan. I'm home. Oh, hi. I didn't know you... Oh, class got cancelled. Are you okay? I'm fine. You're sure? You look a bit pale. After dedicating nearly my entire adult life to the service of these men. After working longer and fighting harder than any white officer in the force having my own people consider me a traitor, after all this. These men for whom I have always had nothing but the highest respect, they doubt my integrity question my honour. Tariq, so much has changed over the years. But certain things, perhaps, will never change. I used to run down the hill every morning to catch No. 8 into town. Same bus everyday. The driver, Eddie, nice bloke, he would wait for me if I was late to show up. I was his regular. There was what? Five or six of us. We rode together everyday. We were not mates, but we knew each other well. And not a smile, a few pleasantries. You know, Tariq, July that I missed the bus in years. But I was there the next day. Hey. Hey. Morning, Eddie. Miss one day and you forget all about me. Sorry. And everything... Everything was different. Morning, Kate. No more smile. Just that look. Nothing that happened before that day, none of it matters now. All they see now all they will see when they look at us, are terrorists. You don't really believe that, do you? Who died? What? It's like a funeral in here. Please. I've had a very trying day. Dad. Dad. What? What time are we going to the galleria on Saturday? I'm sorry. There are... I don't think I can make it. But the book signing. You promised. We'll do it another time, yeah? Tariq. Okay, once more with tension. Just finish your dinner, young lady. It's your turn to do the washing up. We'll go to the Galleria, just the two of us. How would that be? Thanks, Mum. What? Found this in Zaheer's room. So? What are you trying to say? Look closer. It's the same shirt. Oh, come one, Susan. That's a very famous Pakistani band. There must be hundreds maybe, thousand of T~shirts with that logo. Yes, maybe in Pakistan. Susan there... I know he's your nephew. But I'm your wife. I need you to listen to me. I want you to see what I see. See what you see? I know what you see. When you look with those western eyes brown skin is the first thing you see and terrorist is the first word that pops into your head. Sometimes, I wonder what you see when you look at me. Well, I used to see my husband. I wonder where he's gone. Because I miss him. Thanks, Mum. Officially, they're saying, he's on holiday. We British do love our euphemisms. So much more pleasant than the truth. How's he taking it? Like someone ran him down with a bus. Things are very tense at the department right now, Susan. Phone lines are lit up day and night with tips. People who think their neighbours are making chemical bombs in their bathrooms. Most of the time, it's nothing. Just people's imagination running away. So, do you think it's my imagination. The limp in his walk and that T~shirt stuffed under his bed. And the way he covers up the computer screen and his radical views. Yes, but it's hardly conclusive evidence. So, you don't want to help me then? Susan, if your husband, my boss finds out that I went behind his back and had his nephew tailed as a terror suspect. Well, I can just kiss any hope of a promotion goodbye. Who would tell him? He's here. - Assalum aleikum. - Aleikum assalum. Elijah got everything you requested. I hope it's enough. It should be fine. How long will it take to complete the job? I need to be careful. I only have access to the lab after hours. Someone on the janitorial staff is sympathetic to our cause. It's always good to have such friends. There's been a change in plan. It will happen this Saturday. Saturday? Insha'Allah (If Allah wills). You must accompany Elijah to help with the job. That is not what we agreed on. Things have changed. Aziz has been taken in and the authorities are keeping a closer eye on things. Elijah cannot do this alone. I need someone I can trust. I can trust you, can't I? Can't I? Yes, Imam. Darn. God be with you. Allah Hafiz (may God be your guardian). Khuda Hafiz. Oh, shucks. Brother. Open the gate. Open the gate. Thank you. I only need a few hours. You've reached the voice mail of Ruby Kaur. I'm not available at the moment. But leave a message and I'll get back to you. It's me. Are you in there? Oh, hi. Oh, why did you close your laptop? Up to something wicked? Just finishing my home work. Do you fancy a break? I'm going to go get some ice cream. Come on, you know what they say about all work and no play. I'm sorry, I can't. Okay. Commander. Commander? Thank you. You have my condolences. I know you two were close. Any idea what she was doing out here? No. Nothing to do with the Hassan inquiry? As I am sure, you know, I've been removed from that inquiry. Sir, we found this on her. There's not much there. Well, maybe the tech can get something off it. See that they do. Top priority. Commander, you should go home. Commander? Sir? Is there anything that I can help you... No worries. No worries. Commander. Oh, sorry. Hey! Well, Commander... What did you find? I was able to salvage the memory card. She made one phone call the night she died to this number. That's my number. I might also be able to... Just a minute. These are all photos she had her camera at the time. Did she take any, yesterday? There is one. Here it is. Junaid. Oh, Tariq. What a surprise! I know what you've been up to, Junaid. Junaid, I know what you're doing. Yes, I know. I'm watering the plants. I found out you've been meeting with Zaheer, Junaid. I want to know why? I want to know why he's coming to see you. Zaheer? Oh, your nephew. The peacemaker? How is he? I hope he hasn't gotten himself into any trouble. What have you been filling his head with? That there will be virgins awaiting him in paradise if he kills himself. There will be songs written in his name? Listen, Junaid. He's a young man. He's my sister's son. He's my flesh and blood. Do not try to influence him. My friend, have you nothing in your life you would kill for? The house of Islam will not be built on violence. But if people like you continue giving it a bad name... One day, old friend. One day, you have to decide, are you a policeman who happens to be a Muslim or a Muslim who happens to be a police officer? For me... You cannot be both. Now, if you will excuse me. It's time for my prayers. You're not going anywhere, mate. Really? You have some evidence against me? You can show yourself out. Hello. Is this D.I. Marber's house? Yes, it is. I am... Oh, I know who you are. Please come in, sir. Thanks. Danny. Well, this is a surprise. I see you've met my wife, Hannah. Hannah, this is Commander Ali. Pleased to meet you. Well, I'll leave the two of you, then. So to what do I owe this pleasure? Have you come to give me another lecture? I need help. Oh, from a racist. No. From a realist. No, that password didn't work. Can you think of another one? Try Jannat (heaven). J-A-N-N-A-T. Access Denied. Zara. Ismat. I-S-M-A-T. We're in. Blueprints. I don't recognise this building. I do. Galleria Shopping Centre. Oh, no. That's where mum took Imran for the book signing. Oh, blooming hell. I need a tactical squad to the Galleria Shopping Centre. We need to activate Operation Crisis. On my authorization. Yes, I take full responsibility, just do it. Oh, no. Susan's phone is out of range. I have programmed the number in already. Just press 'Send' to detonate. You better keep it. I'll get it back from you after I leave the bag. Where will you leave it? Wherever it will inflict the most casualties. Whoever the explosion does not kill, the gas will. Say it. Say it, brother! - Inshallah (if God wills). - Inshallah. - There you go. - Thanks. Hey, what's your name? Imran Ali. You're going to read this book? Of course. Yes. Here you go, Imran. - Thank you. - Cool. Bye. How are you doing? What's your name? Good afternoon, gentleman. I'm going to need access to your cameras. Daddy. I knew he'd come. Imran, Susan. Susan, I need you to take Imran away from this place at once. Is he one of yours? No, he's not. Where is that? That's the boiler room. Back of the second floor entry room. Will you keep an eye out? I'll best follow him. You. Stop! Move! Move! Move! I'm police. You're surrounded. Come out with your hands in the air. Out! Out! Everybody out. Blooming hell, are you okay? Mike to control, Mike to control, Officer shot. Lower north hall. Call ambulance. Over. There's another one. You killed my brother. Darn you. Zaheer! Zaheer! Stop! Stop! Don't do this. Zaheer, don't do this. I beg of you, Zaheer. Mamu! All I have to do is hit send. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Hold it! Don't shoot! That's an order. Move back. Back away now. You do not want to do this, Zaheer. Zaheer, you do not want to do this. Please listen to me. I am a warrior of Allah. It is my duty. If you do this Zaheer, these officers will kill you. Must you die, as well? Imam would say it's a good death. A righteous death. So why doesn't he die himself, then? Listen to me, my son. A self-inflicted death is a sin in Islam. There is no paradise for those who spill the blood of innocents. Everyday. Everyday, the blood of innocent Muslims is spilled by Western governments and their war on terror. And you, you represent them. Please Zaheer... You are one of them. Please. There is still time. No. Allah ho akbar. Mom, Mom. I was so worried about you. It's all right, baby. It's all right. Where's dad? And Zaheer? I'm so happy you're okay. If anything would have happened to you. I'm all right. I'm all right. Assalum aleikum. When they said I had a visitor. I assumed it was my solicitor. I have to know something, Junaid. When did this happen to Zaheer? When did you burn on this path? Allah showed him the path of enlightenment. Junaid, I don't... After his father died, you were not around in Pakistan but I was. I'm sorry about Zaheer. He was a great soldier. There will always be casualties because we're in a holy war. It's not my war. It is, now. How are you? Oh, I'm sorry. That's a stupid question. The press are calling you a hero. You saved hundreds, probably thousands of lives. I would have gladly settled for just one more. You did a very hard thing, Tariq. I cannot possibly imagine what you must be going through. No, you can't. Try to take some comfort in the knowledge that he gave you no choice. There is always a choice. I know it's early, but I thought I'll leave these. Your promotion has been confirmed. Sir, I have a Fiona Monroe on line one. She said it's urgent. Put her through. Representatives for the family of Baqir Hassan the young man shot to death by police on a London train platform today, confirmed that the police department has agreed to pay an out-of-court settlement. Inside sources confirmed that the evidence provided by former Police Commander Tariq Ali, influenced their decision.
