Your love won't be realized in this lifetime. Your feelings are too strong. Those feelings will end up destroying everything. Your love will give rise to nothing but unhappiness. Shinzaburo? Shinzaburo! Tsuyu! Thank goodness you're alive! Tsuyu, what are you doing here? I couldn't stay on my own! Ifyou're going to die, then I want to die with you! We were bound to lose. But I couldn't die, because of my thoughts ofyou. Let's go. Surrenderyour sword and armor. And disrobe. On your hands and knees, and bow before us. Hey! This one's a woman! This is interesting! Have your way with her! Shinzaburo! Die with me! This is the end! Ifwe were to die together, then I'd be satisfied! This is enthralling. Let's see it carried out. I'm fascinated. That woman wants to die. But it is you who will decide whether she lives or dies. You could even die together. However... Ifyou betray that woman, and simply watch her die... I could let you go. What's the matter?!. Shinzaburo. I wish to be united as man and wife in heaven! I believe in you! What will you do?!. You're despicable! What is it?!. Run! What's the matter, Shin? I was having a nightmare. A terrifying nightmare. That's what you get for sleeping in a place like this. Let's go home. I'm bored here. Yes. Let's go. So what was the dream about? I couldn't remember, once I woke up. You've been fearful since you were a child. Don't be ridiculous. - Hey, wait! - You wench! Get going! You said you'd pay any amount ifwe made good time to Edo! Six times the price is exorbitant! The river waters have risen! - Oh, my. - What'll we do? It'll get messy ifwe get involved. Then I'll go alone. Okay, okay. Wait here quietly. Don't come until I give the signal. Fool! What a stupid move! Wait, brother! You came out too soon, Shin! You would have been badly injured if I didn't. Are you hurt, Miss? I'm grateful to you foryour assistance. Not at all. Where are you traveling to? I'm going home to Edo. As are we. You would be safe with us. You should be happy I'm allowing you to carry the swords. Be quiet. You've got the good job. I absolutely must return today. I'm terribly sorry to trouble you. No trouble. Is it an emergency of some kind? My father has a bad heart. I'm hurrying back with a secret elixir... from a mountain ascetic. I'm so worried that he might have an attack. I see. The sketches will be ruined if they get wet. So hang on tight. I will. There should be a teahouse up ahead. You can hire a palanquin there. We cannot go there. At least do me the favor of telling me your names. He's Tomozo. I'm Shinzaburo Hagiwara. I am a ronin. I'm the daughter of Heitaro Iijima. My name is Tsuyu. Tsuyu Iijima...? Have we met? Well, take good care. Tsuyu. Come visit. We're in Shimizu Valley in Nezu. Can we meet again? If destinywould have it. Farewell. What a fine woman! Yes. Tomo! You slept in again? You're hopeless! -Have a safe journey! -I will! Hey! You're young and wasting your time staying at home. Find a job! Sorry to trouble you. Is it that woman? By the way, there's someone I want you to meet. Who? I told your mother that you're here. You what?!. My apologies-- Oops. Tomozo. You're below our station. Watch your mouth. Forgive me. Let's go get something to eat later. Wait, Tomozo. Mother, please come in. He's merely a servant's son. You were brought up practically as brothers. So he takes advantage ofyou. He's a good man. He's my dear friend. How are your finances? Are you making out? Tomozo is helping me out. Also, I'm thinking of teaching art. Shinzaburo, why don't you come home? Don't sadden me by saying you've renounced your life as a samurai. We have a marriage proposal foryou. Marriage proposal? They have only daughters. They most certainly want you to go join their family. Your father said that ifyou agree to the proposal... he will forgive you. You make it sound so business-like. It's a very good family. He's your father's former acquaintance. Iijima is his name. The Iijima daughter? You know her? No, I don't. What will come of this kind of lifestyle? A samurai's child must live as a samurai. You must have been surprised at this sudden discussion. Not really. My health is ailing. I want to decide on my heir before it's too late. For certain reasons... I must send my eldest daughter to another family. I spoke to your father about a husband... for myyounger daughter. Your name came up. She's a little stubborn. But I would be most pleased ifyou would agree. Oh, she's come. That's my daughter, Suzu. Ifyou want to turn down this offer, feel free to. I would be relieved ifyou did. There's no need to marry for our parents' sake. We should marry whoever we want to. It doesn't matter if the family line is discontinued. Let's go. I'll take you home. You are quite bold. I'm merely being myself. They sayyou are fond of art. It's not very good. But I think I'm better suited to the brush than to the sword. I'm thinking of giving up my life as a samurai. That would be troublesome foryour family, right? My father has tried to set me up with quite the fellow. That's right. Shinzaburo. Would you show me your sketches sometime? I don't mind, but... My elder sister...? Where have you been? To buy decorations for the bon lantern festival of the dead. This is Shinzaburo Hagiwara. Father and I were meeting with him. So he is the proposed suitor? I'm interested in this man. I am Tsuyu, her elder sister. It's a pleasure. The pleasure's all mine. My elder sisterwill marry in one month. It's sweltering! Won't anything interesting happen to help cool us off? For instance, that woman... That fine woman we met by the river... It would be nice if she would come visit us. Right? - Tomozo. - Huh? About the marriage proposal. Yes? I'm thinking of accepting. I won't be a nuisance. Really? I'm disappointed. So in the end you're going to become a samurai again? You were just using me foryour own purposes. You and I really are different, after all. We're on different levels, so we can't communicate. That's not the case! Tomozo! Sister. What do you think of Shinzaburo? What do you mean? I think he's a fine man. Since I was a child, I've always envied what you had. We were given the same things. But the best went to you. I've always felt that way. But now things are different. I can be proud of this marriage proposal with Shinzaburo. Sister. I hope this is a misunderstanding. What is it? Do you know Shinzaburo from somewhere? I got that feeling. Ridiculous! How could I?!. No, I suppose not. Thank goodness! When you leave to marry... I'd like to receive something from you. Yes, I suppose. What would be suitable? A sash. The one you cherish most. I'll wear it to my wedding. Forgive me for startling you. Not at all. Where is Suzu? She seems to be out. I let myself in. Do you mind if I stay for a while? Please do. Thankyou for helping me before. I thought you'd forgotten. Of course not! Why did you pretend not to know me? You did the same. But I've stopped pretending that I don't know you. Today I came here to see you, not Suzu. I can't get you out of my mind! I was interested in the marriage proposal... because I heard the name Iijima. Suzu is smart and lovely. But my heart was already taken byyou. I will speak the truth to your father... and ask foryour hand. Or would that be a burden? Do you not feel the same way? The lanterns are supposed to greet our deceased ancestors. But the bon decorations look so uninviting. I brought my art materials with me today. Don't say anything to my father. It's an impossible situation. It's too late to cancel the marriage now! Explain the reason! Please tell my suitor that I've gone mad and cannot accept! I couldn't do anything so embarrassing! You will marry him, without exception! Please forgive me! I cannot do it! Fool! Collect yourself!. Father! Please forgive her! In this case, I'll have to advance the wedding date. You are not to step foot outside of this house! Don't betray your parents! Who is it? Who's there? You're that man from before. Why are you here? Well...it was easy for me to jump over the fence. I was just concerned. I understand! You're here about Shinzaburo! You brought a message from Shinzaburo! Pardon? Is Shinzaburo well? Yes, of course. He's waiting. I'm here to take you to him. Is it much further? Just a little further. Won't you come with me? Run away with me. Why? Shinzaburo isn't coming. Have you deceived me? Forget about Shin. Please! I'll treasure you for the rest of my life. I'm serious! Tsuyu! Let me explain my feelings! I'll never betrayyou! Tsuyu! Do you despise me so much? You think Shinzaburo loves you, but he doesn't! You know why I've brought you here? Shinzaburo said I could have my way with you! He's betrothed to your sister. But you're infatuated with him and it's a nuisance! If I have my way with you... he thinks that you'll forget about him! That's the kind of man Shinzaburo is! Ifyou decide not to stay... I'll take you away. I'll be waiting. Shinzaburo said I could have you! He's betrothed to your sister. But you're infatuated with him and it's a nuisance! Don't do it! - Give it back! - No! Do you know what you're doing?!. Please give it back! Please, tell me what's going on. I can't tell you! I know. It's about Shinzaburo. You love Shinzaburo, don't you? And he loves you too. Each time I meet him, he talks of nothing but you. When he asks, I can't help telling him all about you. Your favorite flowers, your favorite foods... your gestures... I'm such a fool. He's not stirred by me at all. Not true! Shinzaburo loves you! That's a lie! He wants to marryyou! That's why I'm going to... Tell me, sister... ...ifyou love Shinzaburo. Yes! I love him! I can think of no one but him! You should have been the one betrothed to him. It would have been better if I had been married before you. But our wedding is planned. That's whyyou are going to kill yourself. That isn't so! Ifyou kill yourself... you'll live in Shinzaburo's heart forever. I won't allow it! Suzu! Suzu! I will live... in Shinzaburo's heart... Suzu! I'm not supposed to live! I'll go with you. Forgive me. Shinzaburo... Is anyone home? Who is it? Is this the Hagiwara residence? Suzu! I'm not alone. What are you doing here?!. So you love me as well, Tsuyu? Yes, since the first time we met. I see. I'm sorry. I loved Tsuyu so much, I couldn't help myself. I didn't deceive you. I just couldn't tell you. It's over. I'm fine. I was jealous of my sister. Now I know her feelings foryou are stronger than mine. You two have a strong and fateful connection. I've given up. Forgive me. I'll forgive you, ifyou teach me how to draw. But your father...! Don't concern yourself. Nothing can interfere with us now. Tsuyu... We must return before the guards notice we're gone. At least let me go part way with you. We don't know who might be watching. Please don't speak of us to anyone. I understand. Shin! What have you locked yourself up for? Why don't you come out? He's deep asleep! I'm finished. It doesn't look a thing like her. She looks much better in person. Then I won't show it to her. Tsuyu. I can't help but feel nervous. Why? You've been confined to your house by your father... and your wedding has been postponed. I don't know when you'll leave to your betrothed. Let's speak to your father. Ifwe're sincere, he'll understand. I want a token ofyour love. So no matter what happens, I'll never doubt your love. A token...? I don't have anything like that here. Tsuyu. How about taking Shinzaburo's life as a token? My life? That way, even if Shinzaburo were to die... you would never be parted. I'll give you not only my life, but my body as well. No, perhaps I've already given it to you. So, what shall I do? Oh, I know. I know this seems childish. But is this acceptable? Then it's my turn. Now you are husband and wife. I am the witness. This is stronger than the vows of husband and wife. I have nothing to give you. Please, won't you take me? Tsuyu... Where is Suzu? I think she went out. I've thought of nothing but this. Of being taken byyou. Now you belong solely to me. I'll never let you go. I could consume you. We poor people must work hard! Don't fall! Shin, I've brought your meal. I'm coming in! What's this? You're already up. But you've locked yourself in. Aren't you hot? A meal... I don't want to eat. Are you sick or something? Tomozo. - Could you look at this? - What? There's something on my back. Huh? Maggots! Maggots! What's going on?!. Are you hiding something from me? Disgusting! What's he up to? Oh, no. This is trouble. What are you doing?!. Hurry! Hurry! Well, what do you think? He's going to die. The sign of death is written on his face. That's absurd! Shinzaburo. I heard you had relations with an evil spirit. No, it wasn't a spirit. Ifyou do such things, she'll suck the life out ofyou... and you will decay. So what do you recommend? Leave my house! And take your talk of ghosts and goblins with you! The person I've been with isn't frightening. Then how do you explain the maggots eating your flesh? You have the smell of death. That's why such worms come to you. The worms are waiting foryou to die anytime. Are you meeting her tonight, as well? I have a suggestion. Instead of staying in tonight, why not try going out? There's a pond nearby. Take them there for a walk by the pond. Their true appearance might be reflected in the pond. See it with your own eyes. Is something the matter? Stay away! Shinzaburo...? Stay away! You're dead! What are you saying? How do you explain that?!. Shinzaburo... You said you would never leave me. No, they've trapped him! Shinzaburo. You'll take me again tonight, won't you? Ghosts! Shin, you must be brave. Priest Hakuodo, do these talismans have that much power? Ifwe put these up, the ghosts won't be able to enter. Then give me one, too. This doesn't concern you. Just in case. Are you feeling guilty about something? Calm your mind. Chant this Buddhist prayer. We'll seal this room from the outside. So don't leave until morning. I'm sure those two will come again tonight. You mustn't open the door, no matter what they say. This is Kai-in nyorai, a precious idol of protection. I'll lend this to you. So when you're in trouble, you can rely on this. Why did Tsuyu look that way? She wasn't a ghost who came to curse you. She came back because of her strong love foryou. If that woman died and was reborn foryou... and changed her form to see you... it's a very vicious karma. Why me...? The bon festival in the village will be over in four nights. The power of the dead is very strong now. I'll continue trying to send them to the netherworld. Until then... you must be patient. Sister. Where is Shinzaburo? Shinzaburo must be in here. Talismans are posted. We can't get in. Shinzaburo. It's Tsuyu. I've returned to see you tonight. Shinzaburo. Shinzaburo. The talismans are in the way. I can't get in on my own. Please take off the talismans and open the door. Shinzaburo... You've already given me your life. You cannot escape from me. Go away! I'll have nothing to do with you! Don't be so cold. Those nights we had together... Was that nothing but a lie? I only want to be byyour side. You hid that ugly, terrible appearance ofyours... behind a false, beautiful mask. I didn't realize that, and I tookyou. It was the formeryou that I vowed to commit myself to... for the rest of my life. Not to you! I'll carry the memories of the old, beautiful Tsuyu. So please leave! You're saying that you don't want me as I am. Shinzaburo. I will haunt you. These things are what made you change your mind. Stop it! Don't interfere. Dispel, evil spirits! We'll have Shinzaburo die. Otherwise my sister's love will not be fulfilled. Return to the netherworld! All soldiers, battle the evil before you! Origin of the universe Ghosts. Shin. Shinzaburo? Are you alright? Shinzaburo. I've brought breakfast. Three nights left. Shinzaburo. Shinzaburo. Tomozo. We couldn't enter because of the talismans. Please take the talismans down and let us meet Shinzaburo. You must take down the talismans. Help! Someone help! Help! I know what you did. I also know what you did to my sister. I'll haunt you. It's your fault that all of this happened. Please understand! I'll curse you. Take down the talismans! I didn't mean to harm anyone! I only liked Tsuyu, that's all! But she only had eyes for Shinzaburo. He always gets everything! I couldn't stop myself!. No one can help me. No matter how much I follow him... he always runs from me. How long must I keep pursuing him? But still, my love is unrequited. Shin, you've lost weight. I'll take your kimono. What do you plan on doing with that? I'll sell it for money. I'm going to run away. I won't let you have it. The ghosts paid me a visit last night. They told me to take down the talismans. I've had enough. If it's moneyyou want, then tell me. This is money I received as a betrothal gift from my parents. I won't let you take the Kai-in nyorai idol. Ifyou touch it, I'll cut you down. After all is said and done... we're just a shogun vassal and his hired help. Let her in. Let Tsuyu come in. You're a cold man. Are you telling me to die? You were going to commit yourself to her for life, right? And not let anyone else have her. Then fulfill your promise. Be prepared to go with her, to her grave! You're merely self-indulgent! You only care about yourself. But Tsuyu cared so deeply about you, she came in death! She's fallen for someone who's not all he appears to be. How pitiful we are. Tsuyu, her sister... and myself. Where have you come from, mister? Edo. Are you on business? No. I don't hear any temple bells. This area is inconvenient since it's so rural. Listen. Ever seen a ghost? I don't want to discuss such things! Even ghosts' tears are warm. - I didn't know that. - And...? "And..."? That's the end of the story! Have you already taken down the talismans? You cannot escape, until you remove the talismans! Now, go take them down! Murderer! No, I didn't do it! If I had let Tsuyu in, this wouldn't have happened. Shinzaburo, don't doubt yourself. Tonight, the bon festival will end. The doors to the spirit world will open... and the dead will return to the netherworld. Even those two ghosts cannot stem the power. Something will happen at dawn. Hopefully it will make them turn away... from their appetites of love. Tomozo! Please let Tsuyu come in. Even you are doubting this?!. Please, let her in. I am merely an illusion. I'm incapable of anything but pleading with you. As it stands, she cannot go to either heaven or hell. Please, find it in yourself to save her. You've been betraying your own heart. Even though you know her true appearance... you've been waiting for her every night. Open the doors. Silence! Sister, we have no more time left. Stop! Shinzaburo. Shinzaburo. Shinzaburo. I have no power left. I will disappear before dawn. Before I do, show me your face, just once. I don't want to expose my horrid appearance. Still, I long to see you! Please, show me your face just once before I disappear. Tsuyu... You heard my voice! How can you care for me so deeply? Because... Because you loved me. Though it was brief... our hearts were as one. I cannot forget that. You did love me once, didn't you? You made me so happy. Tsuyu... Suzu! Sister, don't let go! Suzu! Suzu! Shinzaburo! I was able to see you again! Would you tell me once more... that you love me? But we must part. This breaks my heart, Shinzaburo. Tsuyu! Shinzaburo... I'm so happy. It's different. What's wrong? I don't like the baby. And I'd looked forward to having it, too. But now that it's here, I want nothing to do with it. You're just tired. It's hard to become a mother. See you. I'll turn off the lights.
