MARLEY: I guess this new leopard print top and this bright blue watch is... - [Marley mumbles] - Looks like a red carpet. MARLEY: [mumbles] Who... What are you wearing? - BETH: It's his fault. - AARON: Whose fault is that? MARLEY: Dad, look. Look at this. [Marley yells] [children talking in the background] Your mom! [laughing] [yells] [wood, metal creaking] AARON: Home sweet home, right? I don't know about you, but I need a vacation after that vacation. Marley, can you please get off your phone for 10 minutes?

Marley, Marley, please. - You guys wait outside. - I'll call the police. - What are you gonna do? - I'm just gonna check. - Be careful, okay? - Keep 'em outside, all right? Okay. BETH: Um, hello? Uh, we've been broken into. It's 4161 Oak Tree Avenue. AARON: They came in through the kitchen window. BETH: They came in through the kitchen window. Baby, can you go outside for me, please? MARLEY: Someone's been in my room, I swear to God. - AARON: Okay. - BETH: What's that noise? AARON: It's all right. Ha... Um, so... AARON: Hello? BETH: Hang on one second, please. [whispers] What if someone's still up there? AARON: Shit. BETH: Um, how long before someone gets here? Okay. Okay, thank you. They're on their way! They said they'd be here in like two minutes. [cartoon playing on TV] MARLEY: Did they go in my room? AARON: It's all right, it's just the TV. Unbelievable. [sighs] BETH: You okay? [sighs] - [vibrating] - BETH: What's it like up there? Uh... MARLEY: Dad! AARON: Yeah, it's fine! Stay outside! [water running] - [turns faucet] - [tap] Hello? I've got a gun. BETH: Aaron? Police are here! Yeah, coming! OFFICER: Well, the house is clear. BETH: You're sure? OFFICER: Oh, yeah. Ketchup is what he used to draw that thing in the shower. - And you checked the attic? - Yeah, it's all clear. We're starting to get that more and more. Yeah, what they do is they break into you vehicle and then they hit "home" on your GPS. And now they know you're out of town, they know where you live. Uh, look, it's probably just a vagrant looking for a place to sleep for a few nights or a bunch of kids looking to party. Right. That's what is seems. - Ninja! - Stop. Ninja! - OFFICER: Okay? - AARON: Great, thank you, guys. Thank you very much. AARON: Um, one more thing. I didn't want to say anything in front of my wife. But, uh, you know, I get the break-in part, but the mannequin? - I mean, somebody rigged that. - OFFICER: I don't know. You know anybody who's looking to scare you or anything? No, no. OFFICER: It's probably just somebody doing a joke. That's a sick sense of humor. Well, you have a good day, sir. Yeah, okay, you too. - Take care. - Thanks, officers. AARON: Uh, yeah, I'm calling about, uh, to get an alarm system inst... MAX: Well, that's just completely torn. MARLEY: I don't want to keep that. Shut up. [drilling] [drilling] - Hey, buddy. - Hi. - How you doing? - Good. - Escaping the world? - Yeah. Mm, you know what's going on? Yeah. Could you put that on pause for a second? Thank you. What's going on? Someone broke in? Yeah, somebody broke in, but, uh... You know, they're gone now and... everything's safe. - Get that? - Mm-hmm. You okay? No problem. Are you okay? [chuckles] Yeah, I'm okay. Play your video game. - Dad. - Yeah, baby. What's up? - Um... - You okay? Yeah. Did you go in my room? Uh, yeah, I had to shut off the TV. - Yeah? - Yeah. But you didn't, you didn't like see anything? No. No, I just... No, I was in there for like a half-second. I just has to shut off the TV, and then I came out. You okay? [sighs] MARLEY: No, yeah, he didn't take anything. Yeah. It's just like... someone's been living here or something. It's super creepy. Oh, my God, she's freaking out. I know, it's ridiculous. She's such a drama queen. I'm going to take our little friend here down to the trash. You want me to put this stuff in the wash? No. You know what? We need to burn them. Sounds like a good idea. Yeah, I'm going to wash this bed set. It doesn't look like they've been touched, but even so. AARON: You all right? He slept in our bed. He ate our food and... he went through everything. It's all right. It's all right. Just a crappy day. We just need to clean up. I already talked to Miguel. He's going to come tomorrow morning. - He's going to fix the window. - Oh, good. Do you think maybe, maybe we should stay in a hotel? No, I don't think that. We can't afford it. We just spent two weeks in a hotel. Sweetheart, this is our home. Stop it, okay? Stop it. [kiss] This is our home, okay? It's all right. There's nothing to be afraid of. You have to think about it like... You know, we just had some, some really inconsiderate houseguests. - [Beth chuckles] - Okay? MARLEY: My hands, Dad. AARON: Suddenly you don't know where the forks are? Yummy. Now I'm definitely not going to get you a fork. AARON: Baby, you're just freaking yourself out. Would you stop reading that stuff? Did you know your daughter has a vibrator? No. What? Yeah, I saw it when I was in her room, shutting off her TV. Oh, my God. - I know. - Does she know you know? ' Cause she'll be really embarrassed. I don't know. She asked me if I saw anything, and I said no. But... [sighs] I kind of feel like she wanted to talk to me, which is fine. I mean, I'm happy to talk to her. She doesn't want to talk to you about that. Okay, well, fine, I won't talk to her about it either. [Aaron sighs] [sighs] [crickets] MAX: Mom! Yeah? Coming! - You want me to go or... - It's okay. [crying] Hey, sweetheart. Oh, my God, what's the matter? [Max sobbing] What's happening? Did you have a bad dream? I have bad dreams sometimes too. [sobbing continues] Shh, shh. AARON: Okay, you have some water. You're all right. I hate bad dreams, don't you? Yeah, me too. Ah, see? Baby, you know where my black bag is? BETH: No. Did you get up in the night? - What's that? - Did you get up in the night? Oh, found it. - Did I get up in the night? - Yeah. What, are you monitoring my toilet habits now? Did you come down here? Uh, I don't know. I don't think so. No. Why? Because the juice was out on the counter. Okay, well, maybe somebody left it out last night. No, because I cleaned the place, top to bottom. Baby, nobody broke into our house to drink our orange juice. - You all right? - Mm-hmm. Do you have to go to work today? After a two-week vacation? Yes, I do, unfortunately. Why? The kids have got school, and my class got moved 'till tomorrow, I thought maybe we could hang out. Aw, that sounds fun. I'm still a bit freaked out here on my own. Oh, yeah. Well, Miguel's coming. He'll be here in like an hour. You love Miguel. - Hey, buddy, how'd you sleep? - Good. Good. What time are you back tonight? Um, I'm going to try to get back as early as I can, but I got so much to catch up on. Aha-ha! Guess we can close the case of the orange juice mystery. - Love you. - Have a good day. [scrubbing] [toilet flushes] [squeak] [squeaking] [metal drops] Hola, it's Miguel! [Miguel coughing] Miguel, Jesus, that gave me a fright! Oh, I'm so sorry! Mr. Mellor said you wanted window locks. I was just checking the fittings. - Ah, yeah, that's right. - Yeah. - Thanks. - No problem. Sorry about the break-in. I heard about the break-in. Oh, I know. It's a nightmare. BETH: I don't know. All right. I don't even want to think about it. [Miguel sighs] - Beth? - Hang on a second, Melissa. Yeah, sorry! The doors and windows are all done. - Right. - And if it's okay with you, I'd like to finish up tomorrow, the patio doors. Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, would you take a look at the upstairs toilet? - It's flushing by itself. - No problem. Brilliant. Um, and can you take one of the keys? Because I've got class tomorrow. You have to let yourself... [hocks phlegm, spits] BETH: Are you okay? AARON: I just need a glass of water. [water running] [sniffs] [shakes pill bottle] Jesus! We have a serial offender. What's that? Oh. No, you know what? Actually this may have been me. Mrs. Mellor? [toilet flushes] Hmm. [toilet flushes] Oh! Ah! What the heck is this thing? [siren blaring] [shower running] [humming] [phone ringing] [humming] [phone ringing] [ring, beep] AARON ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Hey, this is the Mellors. Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. - Thanks so much. - [beep] MELISSA: Hey, Beth. Melissa. Just seeing if you were around to grab a coffee today. Hey. This is me. I just got in the door. Uh, they're, uh... they're a mixed bag. Yeah, some of them are, well... Yeah, got more problems than others. Uh, oh, I can't right now 'cause the kids are going to be home soon. I'm free tomorrow though. Want to meet then? Okay, cool. I'll call you. I'll call you in the morning. Okay, thanks. Take care, bye. - [lightbulb shatters] - [Beth gasps] [panting] [screams] Jesus Christ, Marley! - Holy shit, Mom! - Oh, my God! - You really frightened me. - Uh, yeah. What are you... What were you doing up there? And why do you have stockings? Nothing, I just thought I heard something, but... - Yeah. - It doesn't matter. It wasn't anything. How was school? - Fine. - Where's your brother? Uh, raiding the cereal, I think. Oh, my God. - You okay? - Yeah. I don't know what the matter with me is. I'm really jumpy. [Marley laughs] AARON: Wow. It sounds like you were really freaked out. - Yeah, I was. - Yeah, I would have been... I would have been freaked out too. That's scary, babe. And then Marley came. [laughs] I screamed at her! [both laugh] [Beth sighs] BETH: Do you know what I was thinking though? - What's that? - I think we should get a gun. - Yeah? - Yeah. Wow. Can't get a gun every time a lightbulb blows. You know how I feel about guns, right? I just don't feel safe here anymore. Yeah, uh... You think I'm being silly, don't you? No, of course... No, I just, you know, I just worry. With the kids and... - It's all right. - You know what? No. I that's what you need to feel safe, we will get a gun. Thank you. I'll get one tomorrow. Want to watch some TV? - Yeah. - Okay. AARON: Max, Marley, time to go! I got the mail for you, Dad. Really? What, are you vying for a higher allowance? Just trying to be a good daughter. BETH: What did you do with the vase? What's that? What did you do with the vase? Report card successfully intercepted. - Come on, Marley! - MARLEY: I'm coming! Move on with my life. [sighs] Yeah. Okay, I got to go. I'll see you at school. - Did you move the vase? - No. Maybe Miguel took it. He was here. Why would he take it? You guys are so racist. No, I... I'm not racist. - BETH: Come on, Max. - Go. You don't think I'm racist, do you? BETH: Well, hurry up. We are so late now. MARLEY: Mom, it's fine! BETH: I'm gonna wait in the car! The key's in the door! MARLEY: Oh, my God! So here it is. I set the code for two... two, four, six, right? - Two, four, six. - Two, four, six. Right. There it is. You want to hold it or... No, no, no. - Okay, well, it is loaded. - Okay. Extra ammunition there. [turns combination lock] - Okay. - Okay? So let's... hide it somewhere and never look at it again. [shower running] [shower continues running] [shower turns off] MARLEY: Okay, I'll see you later. BETH: Make sure you're back by 10:30. Yeah, Mom, I know. - Say hi to Colin. - Okay, Mom. - Okay. - Yeah. Jesus fucking Christ. I told you not to go up here. If my dad's here... Hey, [car stereo] COLIN: So my parents are going out of town this weekend. I'm going to have the house all to myself. So if you want to sleep over... My curfew's at 10:30. Just tell them you're going to Carly's house. Okay. - Stop! - What? I think... I think there's someone filming us. Hey, just... Let's just get out of here, okay? - No, I'm going to talk to him. - No, stop. What? - No, I just wanna talk to him. - Come on! Hey, buddy. Sir, we can see you. Um... [continues] Hey, you're really freaking out my girlfriend, so... Cops patrol this area all the time. [continues] All right, babe, let's... No, let's get out of here. I'm calling the cops!

[laughter] - Ohh! - Nice little color. [laughing] - You like that? - Ah, I love it. Vanilla fragrance from, uh... from work, you know? Cheers! How's work, Meliss? Mmm, it's great actually. - Yeah? - Yeah, I, uh... I think I'm gonna get a promotion soon. ROGER: She has her boss in her pocket. He kind of likes her, you know. MELISSA: I gotta play the game. ROGER: She's good at it. AARON: Yeah. Do what you got to do. [chatter continues] AARON: They're like literally the best of friends. They could not be closer at this point and... But it was cute. It was... It was, uh, encouraging. She was confident. Yeah, she's like, she's a cool girl. She doesn't like me, but... [laughs] Or her, but she's a cool girl. MELISSA: You have to let her go. - AARON: No! - BETH: Not yet! MELISSA: She's still young, but... AARON: It makes me just hold onto Max. MELISSA: She's womanly. - AARON: What? - ROGER: It's that time. AARON: Please don't call my daughter "womanly." MELISSA: What do you want me to call her, "baby girl"? AARON: Call her "baby girl." That's what I prefer. MELISSA: She's your baby girl! ROGER: We were that way. AARON: I have this... I gotta show you this picture. It's... First of all, I got to tell you my wife here looked so beautiful on this day. I think she was... I got to show you this picture. There was this, you know, it's very difficult to get. ROGER: She looks beautiful now, by the way. AARON: Yes, indeed, yes, indeed. It's very difficult to get her off. It's very difficult to get Marley off the phone, so every picture is... Here it is. MELISSA: Let me see. AARON: Every picture she's just in between the texts. ROGER: Oh, yep. Yeah. "Dad, do we have to?" They listen to me that much. - MAX: Mom? - She listens to you more. Mom! Mom! Mom! Coming! [chatter continues] You okay, sweetheart? Can you stop banging on the roof? We're not banging on the roof. Are we making too much noise? Did you have a... Oh, what's that? I don't know. Did you spill something? It's all wet. - Did you have an accident? - No. Okay, sweetheart, let me just get you back into bed. So you think it's like a "daddy-like" thing that she's trying to... Yeah, I know. BETH: Max just peed in the hall. - Where? - BETH: Just outside his room. Max just peed on the floor just outside his room. Yeah, I'm just gonna clear it up. It won't be a minute. - Baby. - Mm-hmm? Come to bed. You look so pretty. [kiss] BETH: What's got into you? AARON: About five or six glasses of wine. [laughter] What's that? I don't know. It's Marley's report card. Yeah? She's failing math. Really? Huh. How'd it get into our bed? - MARLEY: You little shit! - AARON: Marley... We're not speak... Marley! We're not finished talking to you! MARLEY: Don't ever, never touch my stuff! You little shit! Hey, hey, easy, easy, easy. What? You're raising a pervert! Stop it. It's not okay, Marley. Max? Are you... Are you okay? Now, you can't take things that aren't yours, and you cannot forge other people's signatures. I didn't forge any signatures. - No, but you were going to. - How do you know that? Now I'm being punished for something I didn't even do? What is this, Minority Report? This is so unfair! Well, you know what? Sometimes being a kid sucks. I'm not a kid! Okay. I hate you! BETH: Marley! AARON: Let her cool off. She'll be fine. I didn't go into her stupid room! Max, you're not in trouble. I'm just saying, you know, you can't go in there again. - MAX: Dad? - Yeah. What's a pervert? Um, it's... Hi. How was your day? It was fine. I have to go pack for Carly's. - Uh, Max, sweetheart. - Yeah? Can I have a quick word with you? Yeah. - Um, how was your day? - Good. - You have a good day at school? - Yeah. Am I in trouble? No, no, you're not in trouble at all. I just wanted to ask you something. I was cleaning your room earlier, and I found this picture. It's really cool. MAX: Oh, that's Jimmy. Who's Jimmy? He was in my dream. Uh-huh. Do you want some water? Sure. And what did he do in your dream? We just talked. What'd you talk about? I don't know. Oh, he said that he doesn't think that Melissa is as nice as you think she is. What, my friend Melissa? Yeah. Did he say anything else? Mm-mm. That's really strange. I wonder why he spoke about Melissa. Um, remember, you were going to Sam's tonight, so don't eat too much. Do you want to go get your stuff together? - Yeah. - Good boy. BETH: So Max is heaving dreams about strange men talking to him about Melissa. Baby, that kid's gonna need so much therapy, You think you're gonna be able to hook him up with a discount? There's a pretty good chance he saw his sister's vibrator when he was on his little fact-finding mission. BETH: I thought you were gonna stop thinking about that. The vibrator? I would love to, believe me. [Beth laughing] Oh, beautiful. Baby, you look so good. Oh, thank you. - You ready? - Yeah. All right. You made reservations, right? I did, yeah. You sure you want to go? Yes, I want to go. [refrigerator beeping] [Aaron laughing] [distant chatter] [door opens] [Aaron laughing] But it was definitely... AARON: You hear that? BETH: What? AARON: Silence. [chuckles] [door closes] Why did we have kids? It's such a beautiful sound. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna get some wine. Uh, uh, ah, that wine is for me. I can't have the wine? That's for when you're at work late, and I'm at home on my own. You don't want any wine? Mm-mm. We don't need wine. No, we don't. Fuck wine. [panting] [grunting] [sobbing] A new Italian restaurant? [Beth laughs] Stop it. You know, I'm blushing now. Um, well, he had a sleepover last night, so he went out like a light. Yeah, they were up late. And she's gone to the cinema. He's working late again. [soft rock] [continues] - [door closes] - Baby? Baby? Sweetheart? - Hey. - Hi. Wow. What time is it? - It's almost 9:30. - Oh, my God. Yeah, you were out like a light. I swear to God I wasn't drunk. Maybe you're coming down with something. I feel fine. Maybe I was just really tired. Thanks for this. - Maybe you're pregnant. - [laughs] See? Don't even joke. - Is anything good? - Just junk. I've been waiting for an invoice from Miguel. Yeah, I still haven't gotten that. Just fine by me. Let's do something fun today. Okay. - Let's go, guys! - Come on, kids, let's go! The harbor's not gonna wait all day! [Beth laughs] I'm hungry for one of them hot dogs wrapped in... BETH: Marley, your shoelace is undone. MARLEY: I'll get it later. - What are you wearing? - It's tasty. My harbor hat! Give me my harbor hat back. - MARLEY: You're such a loser. - MAX: You're a loser. This hat has been with me through good and bad times. This predates all of you! [heavy breathing] [shouts into pillow] [crazed screaming] [continues] - Remember that swing set? - Yeah. Some kid like broke his face. - Broke his face? - Yeah. Okay, I don't care. Can we just eat? - Can we just eat, Dad? - Why do we ever go on vacation? Is this not better than any vacation? England was so nice. Oh, England! He wants to see Grandma. Why would you want to see Grandma? - Hey! - She's like... Well, they both smell. [gasps] Marley! [laughter] Don't! I'm gonna call 911! That is not okay. That is not okay. [crickets] [pop] [circus] MARLEY: Are you serious? COLIN: Of course I'm serious. What do you mean, of course you're serious? You want to be safe too, right? Well, sure, but who says I want to do it at all? It was kind of implied when you said you wanted to sleep over. I never said I wanted to sleep over. You asked if I would sleep over, and I said sure. Babe, it's not that big of a deal. It kind of is a big deal as we've never had this conversation before, and now you're just kind of bringing it up. And you're just assuming like... Do you ever think? - What do you want me to say? - Well, I don't know. Like ask me if I'm ready to do that before you just assume. God damn! You're taking this the wrong way. I don't want to make you upset. Just go. Jesus Christ, just go. Hey, man, I don't know what... Look... MARLEY: Colin, are you in here? MARLEY: Fine. MARLEY: I wanted to apologize. [beeping] [music box] [Intruder sobbing] [sobbing continues] [music box continues] [sobbing intensifies] Hey, it's me. Um... Give me a call when you get this, okay? Bye. BETH: Hey, sweetheart. Are you okay? What's the matter? You still thinking about your dream? MAX: I'm not supposed to talk about it. BETH: Who said that? You can tell me anything. MAX: I can't say anything. BETH: It's okay. Jimmy saw Daddy kissing Melissa. Baby? Beth? Hey, I've been trying to get ahold of you. You don't have your phone on you? I got your message. What's up? The kids all right? Yeah, they're with their friends. Okay, what's going on? You're scaring me. I found that in your shirt. We haven't used condoms for years. Baby, really? I swear that's not my cond... I've never seen that before. Maybe, maybe some of the kids or Timmy at work. - I really want to believe you. - Baby, believe me. Are you kidding me? Why would I... You think I... I love you. - Hey! - What about that? What about... It's my shirt. What... Are you kidding me? What is this? It's her lipstick and perfume. I really spent all afternoon just sitting here thinking, "How could you do this? We have such a nice life." - I would not do this. - What have I done wrong? You have not done nothing wrong. I love you so much. Would you stop it and look at me, please? Would you look at me into my eyes before you... Hey, hey! I promise you I am not cheating. I swear to you, I am not cheating on you. I prom... Why would I do that, baby? - I love you so much. - I don't know. I'm not! Max saw you. Max saw me what? You told him not to say anything to me. How could you do that? I didn't say... What are you talking about? Max saw you kissing Melissa! You think I'm having an affair with Melissa? - Baby, are you serious? - What did you do to the door? Stop it for a second. Just look at me. Baby, look at me. I swear to you, I am not having an affair, okay? Where's the door handle? I don't kno... I don't know! - [thud] - [music box] What's that? - Hello? - The kids aren't home?

Oh, my God. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm gonna take care of this. Um, shit. - I don't think you should... - Stay here. Everything's gonna be okay. BETH: Um... yeah. AARON: I've got a gun! BETH: There's an intruder in our house. It's, um, it's 4161 Oak Tree Avenue. AARON: I have a gun! I'm coming up there! BETH: Come as quick as you can!
