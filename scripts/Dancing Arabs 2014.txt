We don't want to be embarrassed. You hear me, morons?

You'll be just like your father: nothing but a fruit picker. My dear Eyad... I love you. - Good night. - Good night. Like I said already, your son is gifted. - Greetings. - Greetings to you. My advice? Send him to a better school. Send him where? To the Jews? They'll never accept an Arab kid. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our daily show. Today we have a surprise for you, viewers. A few days ago, Principal Jamal suggested that instead of short, easy riddles, we should have a real quiz show, like on Israeli radio. Welcome Principal Jamal! - Dear viewers. - Hello. I asked myself how can I... - That government agent was in your class, right? - He was in everyone's class. He spent five years in ninth grade. Please, Principal Jamal. "It comes from the land of Uncle Sam... and is blue as the sky. It can look like a cloud. The Arabs have problems with its beginning, and Abd Alwahab lives in it." Wow, viewers, such a good riddle... Forget him. Keep playing. Let's see if these fruit pickers can solve it! - Dad, can I ask you something? - Go ahead, ask away. - What's a terrorist? - Who taught you that word? Principal Jamal? No one. Don't listen to him. He's not a teacher, he's an idiot. Greetings. There's no such word as terrorist... The Jews invented it to confuse everyone. "Warrior" is the right word. - And is a warrior good, Dad? - You're asking me if a warrior is good? Kids in Beirut and Tel az-Zaatar are demonstrating on the streets shouting PLO! Israel No! And you don't know what a warrior is? You really don't know? - So, you're a warrior, Dad? - What? Of course not. Forget it. Comrades, as a strong party, people are following us and expecting us to solve this riddle. Especially since it was written by a government agent like Jamal. Comrade Salah, you're the most educated man here. You attended the university. We're counting on you to do your best and solve the riddle. But I... We're counting on you. Your success is our success. Right, Comrades? The correct answer is the Israeli flag. - Sorry, that's not the answer. - Wait, how come...? - Hello, who's this? - It's Umm Yusef, Wajdi. My answer is the sea. - Sorry, that's the wrong answer. - Why? Dear viewers, the moment of truth is near- In 15 minutes, we will reveal the... Eyad, go buy me cigarettes. Put it on the tab. I pray to Allah that you solve it before then. So hurry up. The clock's ticking. We have another call. - Yes, who is this? - It's Jamal. You owe me for two months! - Pay him now. - I'll pay tomorrow. - Next time, I'll disconnect you... - Greetings. I need cigarettes tor Dad. Dad doesn't smoke Barliaments. The answer is Tomahawk. Right? Tomahawk? - The answer isn't Tomahawk. - Dad! Yes, my son. - "Barliament! The answer is Barliament! - What? It's blue like the sky, made in America, land of Uncle Sam, Arabs have a hard time pronouncing the and the smoke is like a cloud. And Abd al Wahab Darausha is a Member of Parliament. Right! Come on, kids. Hurry up! You are Dad's genius. Hurry, hurry, run! - Good luck! - Don't say a word to anyone. Sure, Dad! - Greetings! - Greetings! Dear viewers, we've had 20 callers and 20 wrong answers. It's time to reveal the big secret. - Go ahead, Principal Jamal... - I know the answer! Get a shot of Mr. Salah. Go ahead, Mr. Salah. Go ahead, Mr. Salah. Or should I call you Comrade Salah? Go ahead. What's the answer? The answer is "Barliament". "Barliament" comrade? - It's the correct answer. - No, wait! - He has to explain why. - Yes, you have to explain. "Made in USA", the land of Uncle Sam. The box is sky blue and it emits smoke like a cloud. - It's starts with the letter "B! - Well done, comrade! - My son, Eyad, solved the riddle. - Well done, Eyad! Congratulations to Salah and his son, Eyad. You've won three kilos of meat from the Triangle Meat Market! Why are you so stubborn, Salah? For 100 shekels, I'll install the satellite dish tor you. - You think you'll manage the receiver? - ll it doesn't work, I'll call you! - Tell Eyad to face it southeast. - 45 degrees to the southeast! Eyad, 45 degrees to the southeast. OK, Dad! - And now? - And now? A bit to the left. Eyad, you have a phone call. It's in Hebrew! Eyad, the phone! Welcome to the Jerusalem Arts and Science Academy. See you soon, Ayid. Thanks. What? No? They accepted me. - Congratulations! - That's wonderful! - Congratulations, genius. - So you're leaving home? Why are you sad? It's the best school in the country! You'll have a good future. You'll be able to do whatever you want. You can be the first Palestinian to build an atomic bomb. Don't talk like that, Salah. Jerusalem isn't far. There'll be holidays and vacations. Don't worry. - Dad. - What? What did you do in Jerusalem? I studied at the university. I know. But what happened in 1969? Why do you ask? Your grandmother's newspapers again? Forget it, son. May God forgive your grandmother. I was 21. A bomb exploded in Jerusalem and they arrested some students who were political activists. I was one of them. They never charged me, I was never brought to court. I was detained for two and a half years and spent a year under house arrest. I couldn't go back to Jerusalem or the university. Did you regret it? No. It wasn't easy. In fact it was very hard. We thought we could liberate Palestine from the Jews. Now you don't? Now we just want them to let us live with dignity. That's why you're sending me here? You know what? Yes. That's why. Because I want you to be better than them. In every way. Understand? Let's go. Take care of yourself. Good morning. You must be Ayid. - Eyad Barhum. - Eyad. Sorry. I'm Yael, the school principal. We're very glad you can join us this year. Here are your room keys. This is the school's community service program. Please read it. - Good luck. - Thank you. - Do you need help? - I'm looking for room 12 in the brown building. Are you Arab? Welcome. I didn't realize they accepted Arabs here. I bet your parents are very proud of you. If I was your dad, I'd be on the top of the world. Your room's down there. - Hi, you must be Ayid. - Eyad Barhum. Hi, Ayid. Want to listen to some Deep Purple? - Deeb Burble? - What? Forget what you learned at your previous schools. We're going to study the philosophy behind the Bible completely from scratch. - And we can only begin with... - Genesis. Genesis. Genesis, Ayid. "In the beginning... Read. "In the beginning, God created heaven and earth-. And the earth was without form and void, - and darkness was set upon the deeb... - Quiet! What is he wearing? Ayid, right? Yes. Do you have any idea what I'm supposed to do here? You have to break down the thani oksid al-karbon. What? I still don't know it in Hebrew. - Carbon? - Yes. Thanks, you saved me. I thought I'd miss my night out. Are you going out? We're going to see "Die Hard at the Edison Cinema. I'm Naomi by the way. I'm Eyad. Eyad? Everyone calls you Ayid. Why don't you correct them, moron? Sorry. AVRAHAMI - Hello, is this where Yonatan Avrahami lives? - Yes. How I can help you? I'm Eyad, from the volunteer program of the Art and Science Academy. Why are you doing this to me, Mom? I don't want this. Just try it. I don't feel well. So far there are 14 fatalities and 30 injured, among them, the Palestinian terrorist who attacked the bus driver, causing the bus to roll into a ravine on the way to Jerusalem. The terrorist was a member of Hamas. This is the biggest terrorist attack since the beginning of the Intifada... I'm sorry. Yonatan isn't feeling well. We'll have to reschedule. Yonatan, this is Eyad. What do you want to listen to? I don't know. Know The Rhetorical Band? Do you play? Not as much anymore. I'm losing the strength in my hands because of my illness. Were you born that way? Were you born that way? - What way? - Arab. Is it contagious? You can borrow the CD if you want. Thanks, it's actually a nice song. "Pedestrianized street" means no traffic is allowed. Are you from Jerusalem? No, from Tel Mond. It's not too far from your village. But I've been here many times before. Haven't you? No, not breviously. - "Previously. - What? You say "previously", not "breviously". "P". See? The paper moves. "P". Not "B". - I didn't even know... - It's nice here. It's a very famous place. Have you heard of it? Important people come here. Amos Oz used to sit here a lot. Amos Oz? Black Box? "My Michael? - He's a very famous author. - What would you like? I'll have the cheese and mushroom crepes, please. And you? Chocolate milk, please. Chocolate milk? You're such a kid! Sorry. I love this song. Do you know it? What kind of music do you like? Umm Kulthum? Yes, but I also really like Abdel Halim, Amr Diab and Fairuz. I don't know them. Will you play them for me? Palestine. Hey, Ayid, what's going on? Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine. Muscular dystrophy? It's a tough disease, incurable. Check out the science geeks. Your parents let you take the bus all by yourselves? What's up, redhead? Forget about him. Check out this nerd. What's with your clothes? What's your name? Eyad. Eyad. Guys, meet Muhammad. Muhammad's dead, yo ya. He had several daughters, yo ya. His daughters are ugly, yo ya. Just like monkeys, yo ya. Muhammad's dead, yo ya. He had several daughters, yo ya... Where's grandma? I want to talk to her. Tomorrow, New Year's Eve, the West Bank will be closed off and Palestinians will be denied entry to Israel... - Don't worry, another one will come soon. - It's OK, my dad's picking me up. How many times do I have to tell you? This is a chance of a lifetime! One day you'll understand what I'm talking about. On November 29, 1947, the United Nations decided the British Mandate in Israel would end by August 1st. They also decided to divide Israel into two separate states, a Jewish state and an Arab state. The Jews reacted positively to this decision. On May 14th, 1948, the fifth day of the Hebrew month of Iyyar in the Jewish year 5708, the State of Israel was founded. What led to the war that then broke out? The war? Oh, the Arabs. Of course. The Arabs rejected the Partition Plan and tried to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state. When the Plan was accepted, in 1947, the Arabs launched a series of hostilities against the Jewish community, starting the War of Independence. Thank you, Eyad. So, let's talk about the war. Please open to page 254. I don't get how you find your way here. It all looks the same to me. - Not at all. - Well, it's in your blood. - What is? - Being a tracker. Yeah? Here. - How much is it? - 50 shekels. Ten. Eyad, give me 20 and get out of here. - Thanks. - Good luck. You're only investing 20 shekels? Actually, that's in your blood. - What is? - Being cheap. - Hi, Walid. God bless. - Hi, Eyad. How are you? Give me two kilos of hummus, chickpeas and lots of hot sauce. - Great hummus for the great Eyad. - Thanks. Couldn't you find a Jewish friend who's not crippled? Careful, he speaks Arabic. Really? You're kidding. Eyad, you've saved my life. I spent all day in court and didn't have a bite to eat. There's herbs, too. - You'll mess up the car. - Give me some. Who cares? You know that Arabs clean her car afterwards. I heard that. Give him some. It's beautiful. Really? - You like it? - Of course. - Does it suit me? - Very much. I love you, you know. Say it in Arabic. - I love you. - And I love you more. EYAD'S HUMMUS! - Thanks. - Come again. - The usual? - Yeah. With oil. - Hi, Emanuel. - Hi, Arik. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - How are you? - Good. Hummus. Do you have chickpeas? - Arik? - I'm on it! - Two bagels. I'm starving. - Sure. Two bagels. Who's next? - Guys, we've made a fortune today! - Awesome! Why do we bother serving breakfast? Right. Nobody's been here for weeks. Congratulations! The air force flight academy accepted me! - Don't I get a kiss for that? - Congratulations. Good luck. Hello, everyone. I won't elaborate on the situation in the region, I'm sure you're all aware oi it. This nice soldier is here to explain how to use the gas masks. Please pay close attention, it could save your life. Sure! A plastic mask will stop the mustard gas. I'm glad you're optimistic, Eran. Please. My name's Ayelet. Every one of you will receive a box. Each box contains a gas mask, a filter, and two shots of Atropine. Honey, spread your legs wider for seven oppressed men, seven Palestinians. Honey, oh honey, spread your legs wider for seven oppressed men, seven Palestinians. Twenty years of occupation, we will wait no longer. With erections and semen, we'll redeem Palestine. Twenty years of occupation, we will wait no longer. With erections and semen, we'll redeem Palestine. Listen to me for just one moment before taking off your pants. Ishmael and Isaac were brothers and we have one father in heaven. You were born in a refugee camp where the summer is hot and the winter is cold. I was born in a tough blue-collar town. We were born the same. Like an Arab worker they exploited me in the gas station across the counter. You were screwed, so was I. Everybody was screwed. Here's to you. - You were great! - Thanks. Whoa, here he comes. There you go. Thanks. - There's no one from school here. - There's bound to be someone. Yuck. This Arab tried to touch you? It's just his sense of humor. Cheers. Think it's funny to date an Arab? Shall I beat him up for you? You're drunk. - I want to go. - Wait! Cute. I don't understand why they served you alcohol. I'm sorry. - It's because of that girl. - Come on, Mom. Yes. Do you realize how hard it is for her? You think so? Where do you think you're living, Eyad? This is The Voice of Israel from Jerusalem with the 11 o'clock news. The deadline set for Iraq will expire tomorrow at midnight. The government has announced that schools will be closed from tomorrow... - Sorry. At least you don't have to get up for school tomorrow. Silly boys. NAOMI, SHIR, TALYA, LILY Are you drunk? What's going on? - Wait a minute. - Who is it? It's just his sense of humor. He didn't mean to insult you. But he's right, Eyad. He's totally right. Well, sometimes I want to kill that guy in class when... What's that got to do with it? You think I don't want to tell the world that I love you? Do you know how much I want to tell everyone about our love? I can put you on the PA system. I talked about you with my mom recently. Why didn't you tell me? I just didn't. It wasn't really about you. I asked her: "What would you say if I told you I had an Arab boyfriend?" You should have seen her. She yelled at me. "Naomi darling, tell me you're a lesbian, tell me you're a drug addict or that you have cancer, but don't ever tell me you have an Arab boyfriend." No surprise. Are you worried? Do you have cancer? No, I'm just a lesbian. Yuck! You stink. - Because I'm an Arab? - No, you moron. Because you just threw up. OK. - Can I call you? - Sure. If they ask who it is, make up a name. - Like Mustafa? - Moron. Is "Moron" a Jewish name? - What about Yonatan? Does that suit me? - No, Eyad suits you. - You know, I love you. - Say it in Arabic. - I love you. - Hey, come here. - What's your name? - Eyad. Got any ID? Sit down. Sit down! No kissing. Run an ID check. - How are you? - I'm fine. - Give me a cigarette. - I don't smoke What's the ID number? - What does he want from us? - I don't know. Keep this for now. Get lost, Arabs. Rabbi Kahane was right. Kahane forever! It's not so bad. It's only the beginning. Tomorrow, the Americans will be sorry they ever entered Iraq. You really think Saddam will defeat the Americans? You'll see. The Americans are good with their planes and missiles, but once their soldiers hit the ground, it'll be a hell worse than Vietnam. Vietnam... May God kill them. Baghdad is burning. May God finish them. They've destroyed the place. Where are Saddam's missiles? Was it just a showoff? But Dad, you always hated Saddam. You said he's a jackass just like the rest of the Arab leaders. - What happened? - The whole picture's changed. Everything's different now. They'll wipe out Iraq in two days. What's with you? Why are you always like that? Look at the moon. It's Saddam, definitely. You see him? What are you on about? Saddam on the moon? Look, on the right. There's his beret, and there's his mustache. No doubt about it: it's Saddam. You see? You don't? Look over there. That's right. You see now? Meanwhile the Georgian guy is still in the closet. That's good. That's good. Yes, yes. So up in heaven, the Pope is on skates, Moses is riding a scooter... It's the alert siren! Get up, everyone! Get up, Eyad! Nidal! Following a missile attack on Israel, a general alert is now active. All citizens should wear gas masks and enter the sealed rooms. Grandma, I'll help you with your mask. - You want me to suffocate? - Go downstairs, Grandma! - Where are you going? - Come upstairs. Are you crazy? Send the kids to the sealed room. - For God's sake, at least wear your masks! - There he goes. Go, go. Please God, for once give the Muslims a victory. There's the Scud. It's coming. Hit them with chemicals, Saddam! Come on! Hit them hard! Come on, Saddam! Straight into the Ministry of Defense! Right on Tel Aviv. Go! Come on! Go, Saddam! Hit them with chemicals! Show them who we are. Look, the damn Patriot! God is great! Hello? - Hello. - Hello. - Can I speak to Naomi please? - Who's calling? - Yonatan, from school. - Of course! I'll call her. Naomi, Yonatan's on the phone. Come here. How are you, Yonatan? I'm fine. I'm sorry to call like this. - Are you alright? I was worried about you. - Same here. - Everything's fine, don't worry. - I love you, Naomi. I love you too, very much. - I'll call you later. - OK. Naomi. A Jew. I would've told you, Mom. Told me what? He didn't use chemical weapons. He just wanted to warn them. He wants to show them he can blow up Tel Aviv. Bagdad is destroyed and you're excited about some scrap metal in Tel Aviv? What do you know about wars? The Jews will surrender within a week. They can't take this kind of pressure. It'll be the end of them. Even you don't believe what you're saying. What do you know? After several days of attacks by the American and Allied forces, After several days of attacks by the American and Allied forces, After several days of attacks by the American and Allied forces, Iraq has surrendered. Take care of yourself, dear. - And be careful. - Don't worry. The American army has started searching for chemical and biological weapons in Iraq. - President Bush says the war was unavoidable - What were we thinking? That we could defeat America? That Saddam could defeat Israel? That you could see him on the moon? AMOS OZ "MY MICHAEL" - Hi, Naomi. - Hi. I missed you. How are you? - I love you. - Say it in Hebrew. - I love you. - I love you more. So what do Hannah's false visions represent? What is the significance of the twins? Maybe childhood friends or fantasies? Sorry. What do you say about the twins? - The Arab twins? - Yes, the Arab twins. - Can I choose to remain silent? - Absolutely not. Did you even read the book? I'm sorry, ma'am. I know the twins symbolize Hannah's loss of sanity. That's right. - So you did read it. I don't understand why... - I don't think that's true. Because when I read it I think of the Arab twins and not of Hannah. When I read it, I see two poor, violent, ugly Arabs who've become the sexual fantasy of a woman who's losing her mind. I think about how they never did anything wrong, apart from being Arabs. I think about what they represent to the author, to the reader and to the Israelis. I think about the primitive Arab who's only interested in sex. That image oi the wild, animalistic, primitive Arab, who's only motivated by his phallus. - I think you're a bit... - No, ma'am. I'm not. Is there anything worse Hannah can do? Is there anything worse a Jewish girl can do than sleep with an Arab? Usually, we're the ones who rape them with fiery eyes. That's what happens in Agnon's stories. To him, Arabs just destroy everything. That's how Benjamin Tammuz writes, and Aharon Meged, and even A.B. Yehoshua. That's what happens to poor Dafni in his book "The Lover". Naim? God forbid. Naim, the dirty Arab mechanic? Naim, who has to shower every time he meets Dafni? You know why, ma'am? It's easier for the authors and their readers when an Arab makes a move on a Jewish girl. He should at least take a shower. After all, we all know how Arabs stink. - I'm not sure that... - I'm sorry, ma'am. I really would have preferred to keep silent. We're more polite that way. Quiet! Quiet! I'm going to tell my parents. Sure it's a good idea? I have to tell them about you. It's better coming from me. I don't know. I'm against involving parents. - What it they get violent? - Cut it out, you moron. I forgot they're Ashkenazi. - Stop it, it's not funny. - What? He was awesome. Thanks. - Where are you, son? - A friend's house. - Do you have a place to sleep? - Of course. I'll study better like this-. - When are you coming home? - Next week, I think. - Do they have a phone? - Of course they have a phone. Write down the number: - OK, bye. - Bye, Mom. Sometimes I forget you're an Arab. Yeah, me too. Don't worry. Someone will always remind you. Yeah. Stop worrying. It'll be OK with Naomi. Trust me. I know women. - You don't seem that focused. - What? No, I'm just... - Just what? - Nothing. "God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it he rested from all the work of creating. - Allow me." - Cheers. "Bless you, oh Lord, who creates the fruit of the vine." - Amen. - Amen. Cheers. Did you talk to her? My dad started having the symptoms when he was 35. I was five. It's not even a hereditary disease. But your problem is hereditary. Sure. My parents are Arab. The truth is, we're similar, you and I. We're both victims oi statistics. Right? Come on. Being special is the best. - It's unique. - Yeah. So, being unique I've decided to quit school. What? Now? Just before graduation? I can't take it anymore. I can't stand the students, the class, the school. I'll study at home. I'll do the final exams externally. Are you sure?
