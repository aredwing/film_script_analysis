You need our legal system blame, not Mr. Ruiz. He did only what Any father Would Have done. Also I am a father, and I Would not do it. Give HIM a medal. Now on to something important. you just turn on the Prosecutor INTEND... Mr. Ruiz to sue. - Ridiculous. Attempted murder His neighbor on... Andrew Pechinsky... - Sentenced for pedophilia. Abuse of children. - This is nonsense. The defense... ... The child is not abused. But if so? Mr. Ruiz is not condemned. Anyone who kills a child rapist, deserves a medal. No, I can not. You can not judge their own games... Justice. Justice. Mr. Stanton? - A question. Why the charge? Pechinsky had assaulted his son. He says. Ruiz had the police must go. But he shot Mr. Pechinsky down. An assailant. - There are laws. Ruiz is Pechinsky life in a wheelchair. Attempted murder. - But the fact... Hey, Paul. - Sneak sneak inside you? I wanted to act not disturb. - You would not be seen with me. Good morning. That case is just your suicide. Oh yeah? Should we Pechinsky stone? There are many Latinos who want to do. You think their voices. - They need you. Forget those cowboy boots Go and learn Spanish. I have come a long way in those boots. Are you coming to my fundraiser? I do not anyway, after my big check? You call that fat? You krenteriger than a donut. I must make some difficult questions. Your son had blood type O. He is a donor. His organs could save many lives. So the boy was three and a half hours at home? You have not made advances? - We played video games. They love the kids to. - You are condemned. You may not interact with children. - That bastard shot me. Receive more minors? What are those questions? I'm forever in a wheelchair. I piss in a bag. You have to defend me. I'm prosecutor, you're a witness. It leaves me cold where you pissing. Answer the questions. If I want to win the case... I might let you testify. I take it with you. Paul Stanton. I want Dr. Rubin speak. Yes, I wait. - We may have a donor. He fits Chloe. But the UOS has a receiver. Get them to give Chloe the lung. Coming. Say my appointments off. - Blood and weight matched. The tissue type is almost perfect. The lungs go to Salt Lake City. It takes too long. My daughter could be here in fifteen minutes. I am sorry That boy is higher on the list. This is for personnel. You can not come here. Chloe's LAS-classification was 91.2. Is not that enough? They have been waiting over seven months. The body adjusts, the receiver is nearby. If you submit the lungs, helps nobody. There are 98,000 people on the waiting list. Each case is an exception. Excuse me. Can I sleep with you? - What you're heavy. Because I can not play football. That will come again. - Mommy and I have seen you on TV. Really? - You were much too seriously. You should smile more. - So, there you go. Good night. - Chloe is right. You should smile more often. Go sit upright. Come here. Enter here. He is empty, get a new one. Daddy get your medication. Hurry. Ll al - Papa get your medication, right? It's okay, honey. Here. But one, baby. But one. Breathe. Since the list came UOS, There are 317,000 registered patients. There are only two reasons to be abolished. They receive a donor organ, or they die. Why are you telling us? After consultation with my colleagues Unfortunately, we believe... Chloe begins to phase 4. This is the final stage, huh? - Oh God. I'm sorry, Diane. There is a rumor that gnaws at me. And I have a name entered the UOS. This should be kept confidential. James Harrison? - The James Harrison? According to his medical record... in 2001 he had two years to live. A few months later he removed. So? - He has found an alternative. Does he have an illegal heart transplant had? Can. Other countries, other laws. Tourism body. In China they sell organs... from death row. In Iran you can sell your kidney. If you need an organ and money, there are options. You were right. The lungs are dead on their way to Salt Lake City. We can not rely on the UOS Chloe's life in order to save. What about Harrison? - What can I do? Ask him about the transplant. - How? My doctor has me your illegal medical history told? Now your political career is over, tell me: How did you get that heart? - It is about your career. As Harrison says, you should do something... against your lofty morality. - That is unfair. It's not about my career, but to the law. It keeps you on the law? Then, defending child molesters. Ruiz, your lawyer is visiting. He is six, and he was three and a half hours in that house. There is no physical evidence that your son has been abused. He's my son, I saw it in his face. So why you shot him? Si. Si. Yes. And you claim that you defend your family? Si. Yes, my family. I wanted to protect my son. Mr. Harrison, Paul Stanton is in your office. Hey, Paul. What can I do for you? Pechinsky on the case. Maybe you're right. You do it pretty well. It rises in the polls. Yesterday I talked to the father. - And that grabbed you, huh? What would you do? - I? I would stop, while you can. You must not interfere in the matter. Pechinsky is a setter. He has earned this. Do I have a deal? - I would do it. The father receives the minimum imprisonment. It is not about the law fanatic perform. It is the society that you want. Do not you think? I take Fri It's bad with my daughter. I'm sorry. If I can help... You can find me a pair of lungs. That would be great. I will pray for her. So Claudia, I'm back at nine hours. Do not worry, I'll call if there is. These new glasses allow you really cute. I look like a nerd. - A nice nerd. What is it? - We go to Harrison's fundraiser. You surely do not want? - It's alright. What is nice mom, huh? - Thank you. Yet you go to sleep eight hours. - You're too clever. Hurry, or we'll be late. - I shower here. Good night, Daddy. - Good night, sweetheart. Thanks. Hello. Carol. Diane. How nice to see you. - Hello. Jim said you could not. - We wanted to endorse. Come along to the others. When Jim asked me to speak... he gave me a bottle of Jack, against stage fright. And offered me twenty dollars. I said I was not for sale. So he offered me fifty. I asked him: You think I'm so cheap? Eventually he offered me one hundred to. So, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. JH I have since college. While I drank and behind the girls sat at meat... Sorry, here's a toilet somewhere? Go upstairs, in the bedroom. And his tremendous enthusiasm and commitment... He was the successful man that we see today. A toast to the worst patients I've ever had... and the best governor that there is out there: Jim Harrison. Thank you. Like all Republicans... I trust you all to, except a public function. I am overwhelmed by your support... and thank you all for coming. So you're Jim's doctor. Paul Stanton. A colleague. I can imagine that it is difficult. He keeps you busy? Beer, please. I follow the case Pechinsky. You're doing great. I hate mass hysteria. - A man after my heart. Nice speech. Tomorrow I prove you're wrong. I have no time for golf. - Oh, what a shame. Thank you for coming, Paul. Harrison has me. He interrupted me... as soon as I approached his doctor. I should let him talk. Maybe this helps? Azathioprine. From his medicine cabinet. Nobody saw me. He misses it. - He has a lot more. It's like a pharmacy. Azathioprine, Neoral... Cellcept, Paramycine. Which suppress immune responses. He needs to take a pill 12 hours, to live. How do you know? - Google: cardiac transplantation. I bet $ 20 that I hit his head. Good work. - Shit. That is Paul Stanton. What are you doing here, Paul? I gotta talk to you, Jim. - Get away, I'll be right. Attorney Stanton. - Right. This is the man you almost hit it. I hope you do not sue me. Not today. - What? I saw your name on the list UOS. - What do you mean? Seven years ago did she give you two years. What did you say? - Do not insult me. According to your medical record hear dead. Do you have private files? I can expel them. Diane has seen your medicine cabinet. Lot immune inhibitors. So you break in at my house? I can put away. Would you? No one needs to know. Is that what you want? What are you doing? What is that? - Dirty bastard. Dr. White me UOS put on the list. A month later I was called from Juarez. How did they think? - No idea. Insider. Access to the list. They knew In any case I had money... and was desperate. - Why did you say anything? What then? I have a Mexican pushed up the list? I do not know them. I can not contact. I do not know where it is. Listen, I'm the guy met at the border. I gave him 100,000. He stunned me and brought me to the clinic. Ten days later, Carol picked me up. So it went. - How to get medication? Dr. White. I had to tell him. Would you really Chloe deliver to those people? You do not know them. You do not know if she survives. What if she dies during the operation. Please contact them. - They call you. Why did not they call? - I do not know. Listen... I've never bribed, I have never abused my position. But I have broken the law, and I am not proud. If this is correct, it's finished. Give me a name. - I do not... Just give me a name. The man contacted. I've met at the border. He called himself Dr.. Novarro. I do not know if that's right. But as he introduced himself. That's all he said. That's the only damn I can tell you. Do you think 100,000 is enough? - No idea. Who knows what a long cost in Mexico? It's been our credit. Tomorrow morning, the in the bank. I look tomorrow or on purpose. Where are my socks now? - Second drawer top, left. What are we doing, Diane? Where are you going? - You should already be asleep. I'm waiting for my kiss. - Okay. I'll take you to bed. Mama Say good night. - Good night. I love you. Good night.

A week later, he Here a new pit-pat. A great cover, charitable clinic. Poor wanderers help. - I help the poor. Such operations we finance the clinic. Come here. Come on. Juarez is the murder capital of Mexico. The City of Death. Die every day by thousands Drugs, violence, traffic accidents. Sit down. Orphans, homeless and poor no donor card to fill here. Their heart, lungs and kidneys... should not be used. Despite the demand. Should there be more deaths by such formality? We disagree. We believe in assuming consent. That concept is familiar to you, or not? Everybody is donor unless he says no. Exactly. In some countries is already a law. When people die, we... This is not what I expected. What did you expect? I was a top spot bought the Mexican list. Even if I could, you take away a Mexican child... the chance of survival. We only cheat death. This is a war zone. Three times as many murders... as in the U.S.. Why not seem to use... others to save lives? Do not negotiate with life your daughter. Jesus. How fast can you lungs? - Usually within one week.

Medication, enough for the journey and a few days afterwards. Thank you. Good luck. - Thank you. We go, honey. We have a donor. - I do not like things with him. Hello? - We are at the border. See you at the clinic. How's Chloe? She insists. Thank God he wants to help us. I'm so proud of you. - I love you. I love you. See you later. We need that mask off here, okay? We hide it. Hello. Thank you. Jefe. What is it? - Good. Okay. I have some money. Better than the bank. - Get used to not. This is the last thing you get. Miguel, I'm crazy for you. Me too, me too. - Everyone, I suppose. Goodbye. - You remember him. My little friend. What's your name? - Camaroncito. What does this mean? - Small shrimp. What? - Small shrimp. I see him. - Browning. Please, do not touch it. Everything will be fine. Camaron? Stay calm. We bring you to the hospital. Backward. Let him through. Come on. Give him some space. Backward. He drove by. It happened so fast. - Caring for him. We bring you to the hospital. Which hospital you bring him? Which hospital? Which clinic? Which clinic? Who called the ambulance? Was that you? Hello? - We have a donor. What are you talking about? - A boy. Hit. Tragic. But for you, a miracle. - No, do not do this. We operate within one hour. Go to your daughter, right? We have to prepare her. - Already? Yes, we have a donor. - Thank you. You should thank God, not me. They have lungs. - Diane, she will kill him. What did you say? - That boy. They murder him. What are you doing? - He is chasing us. I saw a child riding. - I do not know. You're kidding. - We can not return. It leaves me cold lungs where they come from. I do not want Chloe In a box goes home. You're kidding, Diane. You're kidding. Provide the lungs, okay? We do never more to come. Please. - Jesus. On the side. Put that car on the side, now. Marinez is true? - It's not here today. You can not go in. Marinez is true? - Not here. He's not here today, I said that al You may not be there without permission. You kill him. - Not so fast. You organize collisions. Where are they? Take me going there. Otherwise you get the rest of the money. You can not come here. - It's alright. A day. What do you think? Not that anyone you would murder. You use only dead. - Ideally, yes. But this time you put us under pressure. You really expect a perfect donor within 12 hours? How long did you wait in America? Who are you, to condemn us? Come on. You knew what you did when you crossed the border. The boy died anyway. Maybe not this week. But they do not survive long in Juarez. He means nothing. But lungs for your daughter... Is not that worth something? Would you do what is ethical? It may still. You have paid. We can save him. But that would be the death your daughter mean. So what do you do, Paul? Save this oaf? Or your daughter? You act as a prosecutor, or as a father? Come, let's go play.
