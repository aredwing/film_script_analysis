Tell me you'll remember everything I've told you, Frank. I'll remember, Mom. Sit still. Don't be such a baby. Do you act this way at the doctor's office? They've tapped our phones. Your father's working for them. - Don't you understand? - Mom, you're hurting me. Please, stop it. Look at your hands. Let it burn into your memory, Frank. Look at them. Tell me you'll never forget. I won't. - For the rest of your life. Promise me! - I promise. - Say it back to me. What did I tell you? - Sublevel 3, Vault 12. That's a good little man. Eyes shut. Bedtime. Mommy, no! That's the way you want it? Come on. Let's see it. - Daddy! Daddy! - Son, get to bed! Crazy bitch! Give me that! Excuse me. Sir, excuse me. Do you know where Fort Lambert is? Sir! He can't hear you. He's hearing impaired. Do you know where Fort Lambert is? Fort Lambert, the Army base? - She knows. - Can she point the way? Kazzy. Inside, now. Sir, do you know where Fort Lambert is? - Can I help you, sir? - Yeah... - Can I see your base commander? - Do you have an appointment? I tried. You know the Army. I mean, it's like you need a chain saw to cut through the red tape. But your... Your CO is Colonel Turner, right? Look, I know this sounds kind of crazy, but could you tell him that I'm here, that... That Frank Sears is here to see him? I'll only take five minutes of his time. I drove... I drove 36 hours straight from New Jersey to get here today. Sir, if you have no authorized business, I'm gonna ask you to turn around and be on your way. Sir, you have 10 seconds to move out, or we do the moving for you. Get a life, douchebag. Do you ever feel guilty? Here we are, sweeping up trash, while the guys overseas are getting shot at. Well, I would be happy to sign you up for a combat rotation, Zaremba. - You like falafel, right? - Sure. If you worked your back as much as your mouth, this job would have been done last week. Me? Check out that room. Radiation below threshold, zero bio. Toxicity clear. Pull everything from these three rooms. I'll take these items to TTL. We fought for decades to keep Fort Lambert open as a working Army installation. This time, we didn't make the cut. Look at your hands. Let it burn into your memory, Frank. Look at them. Tell me you'll never forget. ... have announced their intentions to build a gambling casino on the site. Does the country not yet have enough places for hardworking people to fritter away their life savings while drinking themselves into oblivion? The siting of a world-class casino operation in a rural area such as Bennell has lifted the economic boats of all citizens of the region. Glenn, I'm on my way down. Glenn! We are scheduled to complete Abatement Phase 3 today, and now you're telling me you want another 36 hours. Erik... Sir. My task is to certify the property free of hazardous substances. There's 50 years of accumulation and incomplete record-keeping. I can't predict what we're gonna find, or how long it's gonna take. Well, so far, you've turned up a quart of moonshine whiskey and three chemicals found in any transmission shop. That's no predictor of what else might be here. This property reverts to the Cochiti tribe once we've finished. Does the Army want some Indian kid to dig up a contaminated vial and get sick? Demolition's scheduled to commence Friday at 0701 hours. Do what you can to wrap out by 0700. Put your crews on double shifts. If you need support, I'll give you every soldier I can spare. If it's humanly possible, we'll get it done, sir. - Specialist. - Colonel. - You're overdue for a haircut, soldier. - On my next day off, sir. Washington gives him hard deadlines, but they won't spend the money to do the job right. - We need two more crews. - Can we finish by Friday? - Lf we don't sleep. - We'll push as hard as we can without lowering our standards. - Agreed? - Agreed. - How's that new pad working? - Fine. We should check it. I'm fine. After you. We do not need a gambling casino here. We're not fooled by these economic carrots being dangled in front of our noses. There is an ill wind blowing into this town. We must hold firm to the ground, and not let ourselves be swept up in its filthy clutches. - Sir! Ma'am! - As you were. - Sorry, Private. - No problem, ma'am. All right, ma'am, I'll watch the door. Ready? Nice ass, huh? Oh. You've gotta keep the weight off this, baby. These long days working at the computer... The worst thing you could possibly do. Honey, just change the dressing. Three more days, we're on leave. A little beach, a little food, a little sun... I have this funny feeling my tongue's gonna get a hell of a workout. Yeah? But I guarantee you my lazy ass gets straight R&R. Shoot the tires out! Sir, we've arrived with the subject at room 23C. Sounds like I got that appointment. You say your mother was in the Army? She worked on this base in 1958. - What dates in 1958? - You tell me. I tried Army archives, but they said that my mother's records were lost in a fire. But I know it was before March 13, 1959, 'cause that was when I was born. And I was born in Philadelphia. Did she mention the name of the program? No. My mother was disturbed. So... Maybe none of this is true. So just tell me that I'm wrong, and that I have nothing to worry about. And I'll apologize, and I'll... I'll go back to teaching my high school biology class in Trenton, New Jersey. And why are you coming to us now? I've been trying to forget what my mother said my entire life. But I was up one night... I was Googling on the Web, and I saw that they were tearing down Fort Lambert. And I tried to call. But I couldn't get anywhere. So I got in my car, and I... I just drove straight here. As you were. With your permission... - I think we're finished here. - Hold on a second. Sir? Proceed, Freeborn. Tell us exactly what your mother said. The best as you can remember her words. She came into my room at bedtime. It was two weeks before my 10th birthday. It was a Sunday night, February 27, 1969. She told me that she worked at Fort Lambert. She told me that there was something locked away underneath the base. Something bad. And that it was up to me to make sure that it never got disturbed. She said it was in Sublevel 3, Vault 12. And then she killed my father. Mommy, no! Frank Chalmers Sears, go to your room! Mr. Sears, are you sure of the words your mother used to describe the location? Sublevel 3, Vault 12? There's nothing in my life that I'm more sure of. What'd you get from Washington? They ran three separate searches, with three different spellings of the name Sears... It's nothing. Mr. And Mrs. Freeborn... Your report says Sublevel 3 was cleared Vault 12 was empty. - We wanna have another look. - Washington has no record of an Eleanore Sears in the employ of the US Military. I've checked every branch. Fortunately, that means nothing. Tell me what you're not telling me. Carrie and I found gaps in the documentation of the activities on this base during the summer of 1958. High electricity consumption, material deliveries when official records show no programs in operation. And how does that impact the accomplishment of our mission? - Here. Today. - Potentially in every way. We suspect a secret program was staged here in 1958. There's no hard evidence yet, but the residue of such a program might still exist. We can't ignore what Frank Sears is telling us. The 1950s was the black hole of secret Cold War programs. After Hiroshima, our military believed future wars would be won in a laboratory, not on a battlefield. Unknown billions were spent, secret laboratories set up all over the country, the best scientific minds enlisted to create the warfare techniques of the future. Discoveries were utilized or written off as failures, or deemed so hideous they were shut down. The very knowledge of their existence buried in a labyrinth of classified paperwork, decades of blackout blocks of redacted text and documents that always seemed to end up lost or destroyed. Before we did this work, we thought the Army must know, at some level, everything it's ever done. We've since found out that's just not true. No measurable radiation, no bios, zero toxicity, pH normal. Well, whatever must have been in here is gone. We should check it out, Carrie. Go to the back wall. Tap on it. Keep moving along the wall. Son of a bitch! What's going on? What's going on? Don't disturb it! Please! Don't disturb it! Don't! - Get this thing covered. - Yes, sir! Please, don't disturb it! Don't disturb it! I told you, don't disturb it! Gloves are good. Seams good. Check. Air pack at 100%. They're bringing them out. There's 20 more in here. Check the power connection? Yeah, I'm pulling it up. Can I get a digital lock on that? Arbogast. Sir. Glenn, we've broken through. Glenn, do you see this? Get that damned thing moving! Colonel Maitland, sir, it's for you. Yeah, Maitland. Tank? What kind of tank? Design unknown. Contents unknown. It's a 30-day job. Metallurgy, ultrasound, x-ray. Look, you got a containment setup Down there, this is what your team is trained to do. So open the damn thing, figure out what's inside, neutralize it! - I heard him, Glenn. - Carrie... We'll take it one step at a time. Promise me, if you feel the slightest hesitation, you'll back off, and we'll think it through. Guys? - I'm good. - We can do this. Glenn, it's cool, man, we got her back. Struss, there's a lot of jagged concrete down there, so let's make sure everybody watches for breaches and tears in their suits. What's our IAT? I'm not seeing any container as waste. I'm going up the ladder behind you. Crane coming up, sir. Breaking the seal. Gayle, get this. Taking samples... Percentages are rising. Now, we're gonna do a panel. Winch is good to go. I'm coming down. Okay, guys, let's take it slow. Let's get in and out. Stand clear. Easy. Easy. Container's open. Equipment is stable. Now watch your heads. What've you got, Carrie? Somebody talk to me. Laboratory detritus. Petri dishes, rat cadavers. Struss, MPP. All right, I'm setting for a PCR sample. Camera's up. Get a probe reading. It's formaldehyde. Checking impurities. Flashing. - Carrie, what have you got? - Rhesus monkey cadaver. No disease apparent. Struss, bring me an EVC, EFA 6243. One step at a time, Carrie. I'm going in closer now. McQueen, are you getting these images? Yes, sir. Flashing. Flashing. - Jesus Christ! - What was that? Human cadaver. Diseased. Prepare a tissue panel. Toxics, viral, bacterial. Yup, we've got three EVCs set up when you're ready. - What the hell is that? - It's a malignancy. Freeborn, what does that mean? Strange pattern. Characteristic of a growth regulation nucleus. Tank temperature rising. Clear these animals. I'll get a specimen of the diseased tissue. Carrie, you want to put the specimen in an EVC or a DH2? - What happened? - Diseased tissue is active! Come on, Carrie, abort! Get out of there. Get the hell out of there, now! Drop the lid! Seal it! Carrie, abort! Get the hell out of there, now! Get out of here! McQueen, get the hell out of here! Go, go, go, go! I got it! Keep going, go! Get out! Get out! - Go! - Let's go. We gotta get out of here, now! - Get on the elevator! Forget that! - Hold it! Hold it! Hold the elevator! - Glenn's down there! - Back off! - We gotta go back! - You'll get us all killed. - Emergency ladder. Go, go. - Ladder? - Honey, go. Go! - You go! What happened? Why are we stopping? Aneta, go! Go! McQueen, move your ass! Oh, shit! Come on. Go, Carrie! Just go! Go! Go! Just go! Hold on to my hand, Glenn! Glenn! - Go! Go! - Glenn! - Move, God damn it! - Go! Glenn! Glenn! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! You opened it. You opened it, didn't you? Soldiers! Friendlies out here. Specialist Freeborn. Identify! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! We have three friendlies coming out. Zaremba! Ritz, can you see anything? It's 10 miles south, headed in. Evacuate! Condition K-7. Fall back to Perimeter A. Fall back! Perimeter A! Fall back! Say again... Say again. What's happening? Carrie, I'm so sorry. It's biological. Living tissue. Growth rate off any known scale. That thing? That's what my mother knew about? She said don't disturb it. She wasn't crazy. You know more about this. You need to tell me everything! I told you all I know. I said don't disturb it, and you did. It's not about me anymore. Sublevel 3, Vault 12 contained a sealed tank. Inside that tank was a diseased body of a man. The organism grew out of this man's body. What you saw grew out of this man. - Where did you get this? - The face, Frank. Look at it. You were born March 13, 1959. Your mother worked here nine months before that. I told you everything I know. I can't help you anymore. This is Colonel Erik Maitland, sir. Colonel, we're advised of your situation. I don't think you know what we're dealing with down here, sir. I got a biological outbreak. Nothing we threw at it made a dent! You have your orders, Colonel. This is a contain and destroy operation. Your job is to contain the civilian population. - Our job is to destroy the enemy. - Yes, sir. - Sergeant Kinoshita. - Colonel Maitland, sir. Set up a command post in here. Board up that plate glass. I want a secure line to weapon command. - Yes, sir. - Shourt! Fernandes! Sir! Colonel Maitland. Establish perimeter control. Keep those civilians back. - Kinoshita. - Sir. Put spotters on the roofs. I want one there... There and there. Yes, sir. Sir, the civilian, Frank Sears, is connected to the organism. His past might help us understand the nature of the organism. Specialist Freeborn, I'm deeply sorry for your loss. We need cooperation at the highest level. All classified records from Washington related to programs at Fort Lambert in 1958. - Teegarden. - Sir. That civilian is still a prisoner. Set up a brig inside. Sir. Specialist, this is no longer a... It is now a contain and destroy operation. Those are my orders. You'll report to Sergeant Kinoshita for supply duty until further notice. Is that understood? Gates, Franklin, Zaremba! All right, let's get these tables cleared off. Put the maps over there, radio here. Supply staff, set up over there. I need every civilian out of here, right now. Quickly, quickly. Secure the back door... This morning... The old Indian across the street, he looked at me like... Like he knew me. The man in the tank was your father, Frank. Your biological father. He knew my face. He knew your father. Sergeant Kinoshita's asking for you now, sir. Army dude says it's a drill. They brought in toxic waste and dumped it. 'Cause the Feds don't wanna give the land to our people. - Your people? Miss 11 %. - Screw you! Like you're even half. Stay clear of them Army soldiers, hear? They're jumpy today. All right. - Can I help you folks? - You recognized my face. Sir, did you live here in 1959? Grandpa, you know you've always lived here, since you were born. Kaz, go to the stockroom and finish sweeping. Look at my face. A man worked at Fort Lambert in 1959. He looked a lot like me. I don't know anything about the base. You used to work at Fort Lambert. He's got a little forgetfulness issues. But he's on meds and I help him. This is my mother. She worked here, too. Grandpa, what's the matter? Why is the Army in town? Sir... Virgil, that disease killed people today. We need to find out what it is right now, before anyone else dies. What happened in 1959 at Fort Lambert? - The government swore me to secrecy. - Well, the secret's out. We opened Vault 12. The man in the tank is Yevgeni Tarasov, a scientist. Defected here from Russia. The government set him up at Lambert. Your mother worked in his lab. My job was feeding the monkeys, cleaning up after them. Toward the end, Yevgeni got sick. Two days before he died, he gave me a package. He said never open it... Unless a day like this would come. The bridge is washed out. We have to walk up this way. Get the shovel out of the back of the truck. Kaz, stay here. Can you watch her? Yes. The package Tarasov gave me is buried under here. Where are your mommy and daddy? My mommy left. But I talk to her sometimes. My daddy's gone a lot because he owns casinos. I lost my doll. We'll find it on the way back. - What's the matter? - Nothing. You stay there, okay? You didn't know Dr. Tarasov was your father, did you? There's a lot of things I didn't know. He was a genius, but then he would forget to tie his shoes. You know the type? Kaz? That's it. Kaz? Don't! Kaz! Frank! It's here! We've gotta get out of here, now! - Grandpa! - Go out the back door! Come on! Get out! Go! Go! It's coming from that way. - We need to head south, toward town. - Take Kaz. I'm gonna get the truck. I'll meet you on the main road. Sir. I've got captures off the M-28 bird. Circumference exceeds 1,700 meters. Play the time progression again. Here's the last hour. The growth rate has slowed. Kinoshita. Yes, sir. For you, sir. Pentagon. Yes, sir. Is there a satellite image that could show us infrared? - That's for the Colonel to order. - He's got bigger matters to attend to. It's my job to get him the best information. Switching to real-time infrared. Oh, my God! - Colonel Maitland, sir. - Yes, one moment, sir. - What? - It's growing underground. Frank! Frank! Come on! Get in. It's grown this much in an hour. I don't know any plant or animal that grows that fast, do you? No, except on a microscopic scale. Bacteria, viruses... The Army will stop it, won't they? Won't you? Yes. We will. But first we need to understand what Dr. Tarasov was doing. This is... That's what we found. - How do we watch this? - With a projector. I know we need a projector. Where do we find one? My school has one. Excuse me. Can you tell us anything, please? Did something happen at the base? Well, what happened? Daddy! Kazzy! I was so worried about you. They blocked the roads. I couldn't get home. These snakes are taking over like nothing I've ever seen before. You don't believe me, take a look. Chopped the tail off with my ax, but the bastard just kept growing at me. Brother, I got out of there, quick. Hell, Ruby, that's just an old lizard tail. Been drinking bug killer again? She ran out of Jim Beam. Where did you find that? Out on the other side, where the power lines cross old Route 17, you know, back side of Lambert? - Grandpa didn't get away. - Grandpa? What are you talking about, Kazzy? Giant weeds growing out of the ground up at the old church, they got Grandpa. She's talking about a root. Okay. - Okay. - What's come up from the ground? What the hell have you Army people been doing out there at Lambert? Calm down. The situation is under control. Calm down. Everything is being taken care of. Will you calm down? At the rate it's growing, how long before it gets here? About two hours if the growth rate is linear. And what if it's exponential? Good thing about public schools is they never throw anything away. I was the AV guy in high school. I've gotta get this analyzed. I better fly this back to Washington. I have to go back to my command post, try to convince Colonel Maitland that this... You're AWOL. They'll arrest you. We don't have time for that. You need a lab, I'll get you a lab. August 12, 1958. Yevgeni Tarasov. Fort Lambert, New Mexico, United States of America. To whomever may be watching this, I want to say one thing. I do not envy your predicament. If my wishes have been met, you will see this only upon the dawn of a global catastrophe. Because they refused to continue funding my experiments in cellular regeneration. They declared my work hopeless and impractical. The United States government sees merit in my work and takes me in like an orphan. My new father is the United States Army. I endeavored to create a biological weapon which can eliminate all enemies at minimum cost. An infectious organism that cannot be destroyed by any means, conventional, chemical, or nuclear. I systematically exposed many varieties of cells to radiation, extreme acidity, high heat, toxic compounds, extreme voltage. Tissue resembles animal muscle, with nucleus structure similar to plant cells. Clustering behavior similar to bacterial colonies. I grow increasingly depressed until I realize, one night, the answer to my quest is growing inside my body. I had exposed myself to the same elements, and my cells had begun a chain of mutation. My healthy cells are being displaced by malignant cells of incredible virulence. My new cells simply absorb these elements like a plant drinks in the sun, using energy of all forms to grow with incredible speed. The flashes from Torbin's camera. Light. Gunfire. Flame. Anything we try to destroy the organism with, it uses. Within two days, it invaded every extremity of my body, and it's accelerating. More than a simple association of cells, it's a single grand organism. That's my father. Self-pollinating with others to ensure maximum efficiency and survivability. I have been unable to concoct... No scheme of reversing the weakness in the blood has been successful. I sincerely hope that my creation grows and flourishes, extracting energy and nutrients from all it touches. You must appreciate the irony. My death marks the beginning of my victory, because my crowning achievement will live on, and someday rule the world. Carrie, look out! Get away from it! And flourishes... No heat, no light, no energy of any kind. We need lead. There! Here, hold this. That'll do it. There. Oh, my God! Frank! Get away! Because my crowning achievement will live on, and someday rule the world. It's taking the heat from my body. Fight it, Frank. Kill it. Die. Die. Go away. You're beating it. You're beating it. You're beating it. I mean, what kind of busywork is this? Let's wash the colonel's car while we're at it. Bullets didn't stop that thing. Fire. Disinfectants. You saw what we threw at it. So what genius thinks that these sandbags are gonna do any good? How about I stretch your mouth open and fill it up with sand, so you shut the fuck up. Hey, tough guy? Anytime. You take your shot... No! God! Oh. You think that's funny, huh? Yeah, paybacks are hell. You need a break to go change those underwear, homeboy? Lick my balls, Zaremba. Given the current rate of growth, here's how big it will be tomorrow. And the next day, and the next. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I understand, sir. Yes, sir, I will be ready to receive General Lavigne. Yes, thank you, sir. Specialist Freeborn. Freeborn, where the hell are you? Sir, I have information vital to the crisis at hand, sir. Vault 12 housed the remains of an experiment carried out in 1958 by Yevgeni Tarasov, a Russian scientist who defected to the US. I have documentation related to that program. Freeborn, you are absent without leave. You will report to this command post immediately. I have analyzed a sample of the organism. I know how it works. You must cease all attacks on it. Any weapon you fire, any toxic substance, heat or energy of any kind will only make it stronger. I just issued you a direct order. Sir, excuse me, but shut up and listen. The civilian Frank Sears has survived an infection. I believe he contains a genetic key to destroying the organism. In the meantime, turn off all electricity in the valley and do not attack the organism, or it will provoke further growth. Those decisions are no longer mine to make. My command has been superseded. Now, because I respect the recent loss of your husband, I'll repeat my order to you one last time. Oh, God. I beat it. How do you feel? Like I ran a marathon. - Only... - What? Stronger. Somehow. Why? Why did I survive? You were born March 13, 1959. Conceived nine months before that, approximately June 13th, 1958. By the progression of Dr. Tarasov's disease in the film, I think he got your mother pregnant before the organism developed in him. You inherited immunity traits from him which predate the organism. When you were infected, these immune factors were awakened, and your body was able to fight it off. I think your tissue now carries this immunity. No, no, no, Frank. Die. Die, you fucker. It's an autoimmune reaction, that's why it acts so fast. Your DNA is so similar, it's accepted by the organism, but your immune factors attack it from within, like a Trojan horse. My father brought this plague into the world. I can destroy what he made. I can make good on his mistake. He didn't know what he was doing. He was too driven. He wasn't thinking about anyone else. Let me take care of that. If I didn't come here today, and I didn't tell you what I knew, what would have happened? Sublevel 3 would have been filled with concrete. It would have been locked away for another hundred thousand years. We never would have known. And none of this would have happened? None of it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your husband. Company, attention! At ease, people. - Colonel Maitland. - Yes, sir. Carry on. You received the transfer of authority? Yes, sir, I've prepared briefs containing all relevant operational information, - including... - Thank you, Colonel. That'll be all. Yes, sir. All right, let's move out. Private McQueen, we're under orders to move out. I've got one more document coming in from the CIA. Thirty more seconds. Let's move them out! Move them out! Our objective is to move every civilian and ourselves south to Rio Rancho. Go door to door. Evacuees take nothing but the clothes on their backs. No pets. No excuses. Ready to move out. You, too. Shako squadron. Sir. CIA confirms there was a Dr. Yevgeni Tarasov defected from the Soviet Union in 1958. - Army set him up here at Fort Lambert. - Carrie was right. Tarasov specialized in cellular mutation used as a biological weapon. Too late for a history lesson. We've got a town to evacuate. But Colonel Maitland, sir! You heard the Colonel, Private McQueen. The time for questions is over. We have orders to evacuate this town. Yes, Sarge. A Unit 669 in position. Commence firing. Left flank, move north, helix 887. Airborne 123, move out. Helix 678, continue fire. Confirm. Airborne 523, report position... It's inside! Somebody, please! Tell us what's happening! Please, somebody tell us what to do! The explosions are stimulating the growth. It's here. We've got to get those people out of here. Get out there and deal with the situation. Move it! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Keep moving. No, you don't need to run. Just keep moving. Keep it slow, look out. - Sir, do you need some help? - As fast as you can. No pushing. Who ordered my bus to get loaded? Hey. Teegarden! - Sears, I should have known it was... - Teegarden, listen. You've got to help. You've got to help. You are absent without leave. What do you think you're doing? All right. Okay, go! Go! - Teegarden, stand down! Stop! - Damn it, what do you think you're doing? Okay. He's the only person who can stop it. He's the only one. - Teegarden, stand down. Stand down. - Freeborn, you have no authority here. God damn it! Get out of the way! Get these people out of here. Go south. Go south. Pick up as many people as you can. Go! Go, go! Zaremba, take the street. Shourt, clear the alley. - Alone? - Well, take Kinoshita with you. Yes, sir. I just spotted Freeborn on foot heading west on Main. Arrest her on sight. Go, go, go! Pull back. Give it everything you've got! All units, report! Report! Somebody answer the damn radio! Got it right here. Come on, Ozzie. Are you under the bed? Ah, man. Where did you get to, anyway? Ozzie, come on back. I'm serious, now. We need to get out of here. Something's going on, and you're gonna be in trouble, - and I don't want to have to... - Get out of here! - What? Dude... Quit shoving, man! - Get him out of here. I'm not leaving here without my cat, man. Here, I'll help you. Get in the car! Start the ignition. Drive south. As fast as you can. You don't have enough blood, Frank. You can't do it like this. You're the key to destroying it, but not if you bleed to death. Come on, I have an idea! Come on! Initiate scenario D. Central Command, confirm! Initiate scenario D. Confirm! Confirm! I can fly this. I'll get us out of here. There's an immunology lab in Albuquerque. I'll take you there. They can isolate the factors in your blood, clone them, produce mass quantities and spray by air. That thing will cover North America by then. The sun's coming up in three hours. That thing feeds off energy. A square mile of the Earth's surface gets enough sun in a day to equal a two-kiloton atomic bomb. That thing will grow out of control. Glenn would know. Yeah, he'd think this through. He would know. What would he know? You knew him better than anyone else. What would he be thinking right now? Growth regulation nucleus. What? On Tarasov's chest, a radial growth. Glenn said it was a growth regulation nucleus. On my father's body? When a part of the organism is severed, it tries to rejoin the main body. A single organism, its growth is regulated by the nucleus. So if we kill the nucleus? The growth will regulate to zero. Then the whole thing dies. You can drop me off at the base. I'll find my father's body. You'll never find Vault 12 by yourself. I'll take you. Carrie. I have the immunity, you don't. I'll take you as far as I can. Delta Charlie 2-8-1, Kirkland Tower. Wind is 2-9-0 at 7. You are cleared for takeoff. Freeborn. What happened to you? We found a way to kill the organism. I'm flying us into Lambert. And I'm ordering you to walk out that door. - Frank's blood can... - You are AWOL, Freeborn! - Look, sir, if I kill the nucleus... - One more word out of you... Look, you didn't listen to me before and look what's happening. - Colonel! - Lf you are within 10 miles of here at 0430 hours, you will be dead. This valley is going to be carpeted by tactical nuclear warheads in 25 minutes. It will feed on the radiation. It feeds on any energy source. You have to stop them. I have no power to stop anything but your death. I respected the hell out of your husband. Now, for his sake, move of your own accord... Colonel Maitland. Colonel! Colonel Maitland, are you okay, sir? Sir, we have an unidentified aircraft moving northeast in the target zone. Initiate Mike 86 warning protocol. Proceed with attack plan. Roger that, sir. Aircraft, flying in Fort Lambert, heading on zero-five-niner, you are in violation of restricted airspace. You need to immediately change course to heading one-niner-zero. To repeat, heading one-niner-zero. And leave that... You are in violation of government-restricted airspace. Turn to one-niner-zero immediately. You face an immediate military strike on your aircraft. I repeat, turn to one-niner-zero! You are facing an immediate military strike on your aircraft. There will be no further communication. They're still heading zero-five-niner, sir. They're not moving. - Take them down. - Roger that. I've got to put this down! Brace yourself! This goes down to Sublevel 3. Bullets didn't matter. Knives. Guy has the touch, though. Didn't hurt him. The thing frigging died when he put his hands on it. Teegarden, what the hell are you talking about? He's got the touch. He saved my life. Stop here and set up a Sat-link. I want pictures. Point G-H-5-8 heading south. Joint L-R-0-7-6, that's point G-H-43, and proceed south. You got the coordinates set? Yes, sir. Infrared is up, sir. All units, proceed south to green line. Confirm positions on arrival. All units, proceed south to green line at maximum speed. This is Fort Lambert, two minutes ago. Last pass of the satellite. Widen the view. Crap! Zoom in. Track that movement to the left. Look, there they are. Oh, my God. They're alive. Vault 12 is that way, at the end. Glenn! Glenn! Glenn! Glenn! Glenn! Frank! Help, Frank, help! Help! Frank! Sir, something's happening. The sucker's dying. Proceed south immediately. Make sure Air Force Regional Command is seeing this. - Yes, sir. - Bombers incoming, sir. This is Colonel Erik Maitland, United States Army. Request emergency interrupt for General Torrence. Look at your IRSat incoming. The organism is dying. I have personnel trapped inside the blast zone. Sir, strongly recommend you abort mission. Over. Delta Charlie 2-8-1, abort mission. I repeat, abort mission, Delta Charlie 2-8-1. Roger, Command. Delta Charlie 2-8-1 returning to base. Could they have survived? Whether they made it or not, we're gonna be the ones to pull them out. - Let's move out. - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!
