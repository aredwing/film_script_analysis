You worry about your own shiftless self. You get busy! - Mommy, I'm hungry. - That's too bad. The kitchen is closed. You should've ate more than three peas. - [Nate And Wendell] "I ate three peas." - Shut up. Clinton. What kind of example are you setting, being the oldest? - Can you hear me? - Yes. You are so immature! - I hate doing... - When you finish mashing peas into the floor, mop. - I'd rather have a father than a mother any day. - Yeah, any day. What'd you say? What did you say? - He said, "I'd rather have a father than a mother any day." - Dang! Take your father! Take your father! Let's see how your hungry asses eat! I'm not playin'. Come here.

You can't be runnin' up and down the street after your brothers all day long. Would I miss my birthday? You would spend it with them. That would be good. That would be great. Would you please eat some breakfast? I have to go to work. [Snagglepuss On Television] Heavens to Mergatroid. Exit for child welfare stage right.

I see you and your little friends throwing that garbage into my areaway and my backyard. Just shut the hell up. That's a lie! How dare you talk about my family like that? You should be shot. Wendell, what's wrong? This stinkin' man's accusin' me of things I didn't do. Oh, you'll see. Look. Look. Look at him pickin' up his own garbage. I caught him throwin' this trash on my property. And he's a ringleader. He makes these other kids that sit on the stoop do the same... - How dare you accuse my son? He does no such thing. - Yes, it's him... - and this other one. - We don't do nothin' to you. My kids and their friends can't sit on our stoop, let alone play in our backyard, without having to smell that disgusting odor of dog shit emanating from your house. - Clean up that filth. - My house is not filthy!

You let him catch you? - What was I supposed to do? - You should have told him... "I don't have to steal nothin' from you. I just forgot my money." - Oh. - Next time, steal somethin' easier. Yeah! My main man! Walt "Clyde" Frazier. We better win tonight. - [Sportscaster] It's a very important game. - Stupid! Why you go and pass the ball to him? Jackson ain't nothin'. Lucky rebound.

[Shouting] I knew he are makin' it. That's number one right there. [Sportscaster] Frazier with 24 points. - [Clinton] Oh, man! - [Game Continues Indistinctly] Only one way to find out. [Clinton] Get the ball. What you waiting for, stupid? Damn it, Woody, you bounced another check. I thought we had it covered. [Sighs] I'll get some money. - When? - When? What do you think I'm doin' right here? Gem, let me just finish this music. That's what I've always done. The problem is... your music's not bringin' anything into the house but music. Gem, the money will come. I'm waitin'. I'm back teachin' school again, and I am waitin', Woody. Just keep doin' what you're doin', Gem. Now you know it wasn't always like this. I made money before. I'll make money again. I trust you, but you have got to realize... we are on a limited budget. I am trying to balance everything, and when you write checks and don't tell me about it, it makes it extremely difficult. As God is my witness, I want the best for you and the children. But I have got to do it in my own way. Look it... - Cool? - Cool. I went out and opened a separate bank account. That supposed to get some kind of reaction from me? What is that supposed to prove? I don't know what it proves. I'm interested in putting food on the table and keepin' a roof over our kids' heads. Boy! You know, y-y-you really kill me. I mean, on the one hand, you come down here... tellin' me about yet another mistake Woody done made. But when I'm sittin' at that piano, tryin' to do my work, tryin' to concentrate, you won't let me do that neither. You got a beef with that. I don't know what to do. You can get up off my chair. I don't want to talk about your mistakes. You keep track of those. I don't have time. All I ask you is to write down when you spend the money I am making. - I told you it was a legitimate mistake. - I appreciate that, but you have made that mistake five times this month. - I just want you to change the pattern. - I don't need no lecture... - about how to conduct myself in this house. - I am asking you... - to help me conduct the business affairs of this family! - What the hell... - do you think I'm tryin' to do? - I don't know what you're doin'. Well, let me tell you. I got to be like a thief in the night in this house... every time I want some privacy to do my work. You selfish child! Don't tell me about privacy. - Selfish nothin'! - I can't even take a piss... without six people hangin' off my tits. - You a big saint around here, and I ain't shit. - Call yourself what you want to. - I just asked you to write down the check. - I wrote the check, right? - I wrote the stupid thing. - I think you can do two things at once: Make music and write. Woody... wrote... a... bum... check. - Here. - That's very cute. You remember to write it down before it bounces next time. You know, you seem to forget... I'm the one used to pay for you and the children to go to Bloomingdale's... and Lord & Taylor to get what you wanted when you wanted. - [Clinton Shouting] - You ain't the only one contributed to this family. - It's a foul! Where the referee? - [Indistinct] - Clinton! - What? Don't answer me "what." Turn the goddamn TV off. - I'm watchin' the Knicks! - I don't care what it is. No TV on a school night! She can scream all she want. I'm watchin' this game. - Hey! No TV! Turn it off! - Mom, it's just a game. - Who is that? - That was Nate. - It wasn't me, Mommy! If the TV's not off, I'm whippin' everybody. [Joseph] Troy! I have to go to the bathroom! - [Knocking] - Open up before I pee on myself. Come on, Troy! - [Knocking] - Troy! What are you doing? Come on! Open the door! ...if you ever chastise your boys. Hey! Clinton, don't let me get up there! - Clinton! - [Joseph] Troy! In a minute! - Walt Frazier's not payin' my bills! - It ain't about Walt Frazier! [Carolyn] I'm sick of this shit. Troy! Troy! Surprise, boys. - I'm watchin' the game! - Boy, I'll knock you out. - What's the big deal? - I said no TV on a school night, damn it! The Knicks got a job. You need an education. I will throw this idiot box out the window. Troy, let Boogie in the bathroom. She won't let me watch the game. How dare you go to your father to defy me, boy! - Let him watch the game. - Woody, don't touch me. - Come on, Gem. - Get your hands off of me. - Troy won't let me go to the bathroom. - Shut up! I own this mammy-jammy house. I pay Con Ed for the electricity. When you start payin' the bills, everybody else gets to decide... when you put the TV on and when not. I'm watchin' this game. - Boy, I'm gonna knock you out! - Get off me! [Screaming, Shouting] Hey, Troy! [Shouting, Screaming] Everybody, stop! Stop! What I want... is some respect for my work... in this house. You get out of my house. You call your brother, and you tell him to come and get your shit. That's just fine. If that's what you want, that's what you get. [Nate] See what you did? See what you started? - [Clinton] It wasn't my fault. - You want to go to your room? [Nate] You want some ice? # I, oh, I # # I know a place, y'all # # I'll take you there # - [Door Buzzer] - Ain't nobody cryin' # # I'll take you there # # Ain't nobody worryin', yeah # # I'll take you there # # No silent faces # # No silent faces # - [Indistinct Shout] - # I'll take you there # - Now with black side. - # Power to the races # - # I'll take you there # - Hey, little Miss Coomish Mimmish. - Hi, Uncle Brown. - Here's the other bag, man. - # I'll take you there ## - You ready to go? - Yep. - Get down.

I cleaned the kitchen, and I made Mommy breakfast. - That's great. - I think she's feeling better now. That's good. Troy, your father's sorry about last night. It's not your fault, Daddy. You know Daddy doesn't want to fight or yell or scream or holler. All Daddy wants to do is play his music. - That's all. - Maybe if you played other people's music... Mommy wouldn't scream and yell at you. I can't do that anymore, Troy. I got to work on my music now. Well, maybe you should just go for taking her out on a date. - You think so, huh? - I do. Hey, listen, this is for you and your brothers. - What, you don't like candy no more? - No, I do. I want you to give this to your mother for me. - Okay? - Sure. - Everybody else doin' all right? - Yeah. I think. All right, Miss Coomish Mimmish. Come here. Hey. Your father loves you, Troy. I love you too, Daddy. Ah. These are from Daddy. You could at least open this. He told me to tell you he wants to take you out on a date. Candy from Dad.

Troy, I know you can hear me calling. Troy! You seen my Knicks tickets? - Who cares about you and your stupid... - You seen my tickets? - If you touched my tickets, I'm gonna break your neck. - Break it then. - Ow! Get off of me! - Shut up! Give me my tickets. Why should I? You started the fight between Mommy and Daddy! - Give me my tickets! - You're hurting me! I don't care. Gimme my tickets and I'll let you go. All right, nigger. I hate your guts. I hate your guts. Who told you you could go in my room in the first place? Next time, I'm gonna punch you in your face. Heifer! I spent them funny-lookin' nickels of yours also. M-o-o-o-o-m! H-E-L-L N-O and you are not it. Outta here. # There's a German in the grass with a bottle up his ass # # Stick it in, stick it out Do you wanna be a scout # - Hell, no. - N-O spells "no" and you are not it. Hot peas and butter! Come and get your supper! Come on. You can run faster than that. I know you can find it. - You can't even guess. Come on, come on. - I warned you!

I beg your pardon! - Bye, Troy. - Bye, Minnie. See you tomorrow. Where you goin', Troy? And you stop following me, Greg. I ain't followin' you, Troy old boy. Troy! Huh? I need to ask you somethin'. Clinton claims you stole his prize collection of Buffalo nickels. They're very valuable, and they mean a lot to him. - Did you take them? - No. - Did you take 'em? - No! - You look cute, Mrs. Carmichael. - Thank you, Greg. - [Carolyn] How's your mother? - [Greg] She's okay. - What's wrong? - Troy. She's always pickin' on me. She teases me about school. She calls my mother names. She treats me mean. She makes fun of me in front of her friends. It's not fair. I want to be her friend, but she doesn't like me. [Carolyn] Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. - [Greg] Thank you. - Troy! Mommy, somebody left the toilet seat up, and I almost fell in again. Never mind about that now. I do not believe what I just heard. - Why are you calling people's mothers names? - Mommy, I didn't. Don't lie to me. Why is that child standin' outside with crocodile tears in his eyes? - You go back outside right now and apologize. - But I didn't do anything! Go! - I'm sorry, Greg. - You sorry why? Sorry I called your mother a ho. You sorry about teasin' me about bein' left back three times... - and about me and my brothers havin' three different fathers? - All right, already. - I said I was sorry. - You better be. - Thank you, Mrs. Carmichael. - That's okay, baby. - Stupid. - Hey, hey! - Stupid. - Hey, hey! Hey, come here. I want you to go to the supermarket and get some things for dinner. Mommy, I hate food stamps. Besides, we ain't even on welfare. Stop sayin' "ain't." You better be glad we got some food stamps. Go on. Mommy! Everyone's gonna laugh at me. Ain't nobody gonna laugh at you that ain't on welfare theyself. Scat! - How come I have to go? - Do you want to have dinner tonight, Troy? Go! # Pass the peas, please, pass the peas like you used to say # # Pass the peas like you used to say ## ## [Continues] Where you going? Come back here! Put those things on the counter. What do you mean you didn't take it? If you don't put it down, I'm gonna call your mother. - I'll have your place shut down, man. - Come on. Give it here. - Aha! What is this? This is your hips? - So what! - Come here. - Get your hands off me, you coconut West Indian monkey. Listen you little pickaninny. Get out of my store... and don't come back here no more!

You round here wrestlin' your brothers all the time, and you let some girl named Peanut take my groceries and my food stamps? I oughta whip your butt my damn self. Go upstairs and get your brother and go get my things. That's all right. I hate liver anyway. I'm glad Troy got her butt kicked. Should have kicked her myself. She thinks she's so cute. Shut up, you ugly baboon. Why you be teasin' people? - You ain't talkin' to me. - Be quiet with your Rashy Moustachie self. - Why you always callin' people names? - 'Cause I feel like it!

Not yet, but I will. Take her out now, Daddy. Take her out now. Young lady, I want you to get some rest. You hear? It's for later. They're spirited, but I don't know why our kids are ostracized by your family. - Welcome back, Daddy. - Thanks, Wendell. - Clinton, you go to the game? - # I can see clearly now # - Yeah, Knicks won. - # The rain is gone... # - Daddy, you burnt the toast. - That ain't burnt. It's just a little dark. Give it here. Kids in the Delta would love to have that to eat, and a father nice enough to burn it. - Okay? - You are gonna give us heart attacks, Woody. Daddy, these eggs are runny. - Eat those eggs! - The food was prepared by your Pops... with tender, loving care, so you will eat it, am I right? Celeste has had Joan, Sam and Viola out to St. Louis, and she's never asked our kids. I ain't studying about Celeste. Woman's mean and evil. - [Kids Laughing] - That's your sister. - Yeah. - I don't want to visit Aunt Celeste. We don't need to visit nobody. We got the car. We can go for a drive. - Can we leave Brooklyn? - Take you anywhere... - Can we please leave Brooklyn? - Yes, we can. Hey, Miss Coomish Mimmish.

You can sit with me. This is 7 Arlington Place? - Yeah. - I have an order to shut off your electricity. - What? - You gotta pay your bill. - The bill is paid. - No, the bill is unpaid. "7 Arlington Place. Unpaid bill. Service to be shut off." - Did you pay it? - [Sighs] Yes, I paid it. This is the second time they done made this mistake. - Children, go on in the house. - Oh, Daddy! - You can call if you'd like. - No, I'm not makin' a call. - Just doin' my job. - The bill is paid, Gem. Okay, do what you gotta do. All right. Come on. Oh, my God. Que paso aqui? - [Vic] What the damn candles in here for? - [Jessica Speaking Spanish] Looks like a church. Turn the lights on. - It's not working. - What do you mean? Oh, hey. How y'all doin'? - Hi, Mr. Carmichael. - Y'all blow a fuse or somethin'? - What happened to the lights? - Where y'all been? - What's with the candles? - There's enough candles in here, I know that. Yeah, we, uh... We havin' some financial problems right now. We understand. I was hopin' that the food stamps would help. Um, anyway... Oh. Like I was sayin'... Here you go, Vic. We, uh... We didn't blow no fuse. Uh, the damn electricity been cut off. - What? - Yeah. Drag, man. - Come again? - We ain't got no electricity, and neither do you. You know I need my lights. Can't sleep, can't think, can't read without my lights. - It won't be for long. - How I'm supposed to cook without no lights? Probably just a couple of days 'til we can get it straight. - A couple of days? - Ain't that a bitch. Payin' you good money for rent, and I ain't got no damn lights? Well, now, that's what I'm sayin'. I give y'all some candles. - Forget candles. - You don't understand what you're dealin' with. M-My disability requires that I have my light. Well, I know it's an inconvenience, Vic. It's an inconvenience to everybody. But I'm gonna go down there tomorrow, and I'm gonna straighten it out, okay? I hope you don't expect us to pay rent. Si no hay luz, no hay renta: No lights, no rent. Well, now, Miss Jessica, I don't know 'bout no "us," 'cause you don't even live here, - but I do expect you to pay, Vic. - Now I don't live here? You gonna let him say that to me? [Speaking Spanish] - I don't live here now? - I think I done paid enough, Mr. C. I got enough shrapnel in my back, I'm afraid to get wet. I think I done paid far too damn much. Now hold up now, Vic. - You know I don't want no hollerin' and screamin'. - I don't mean no disrespect... - to you or your cares, Mr. C. - Okay. I think my rent has put just as much food on your baby's table as you do. - Well, now, okay... - I did not have to give your wife those food stamps. Vic, let's go. Just forget about it, okay? I can't live like this no more. [Jessica Muttering In Spanish] Now, at least y'all still got gas and hot water. - [Jessica Muttering] - Okay, Vic? It's good, baby. I like eatin' by candlelight. Kind of romantic. - Are you wooin' me? - It wouldn't do me much good right about now, would it? This is fun. - Does this mean we can't watch TV? - That's right. - No cartoons. - No Brady Bunch or Partridge Family... - for Troy and Nate. - Hey, nigger, I don't watch that show. - You do so watch that show. - Liar. - Nigger. - Stop calling each other nigger. - And you can't watch the Knicks. Come on. Let's just eat in peace. Daddy's got some good news. I'm giving a solo concert. - [Clinton] Great. - [Troy] Wow! Daddy! This is the one, Gem. This one's gonna be real special. Clinton, Wendell and Nate? I need y'all to get out, put up some posters for Daddy. - Can you do that? - All right. - That's fine with me. Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of the house. Everything's gonna be all right. Thank you, Tommy. And call those numbers if you need us. You see anybody actin' suspiciously around the house, you stand on that top step, and you sing, okay? - I'll see you when you come back. - You'll scare off the whole neighborhood. - Drive safe, all right? Take care. Bye. - Okay. No one's gonna step on this stoop, I'll tell ya. All right, bye-bye. - Have a safe trip. - Bye-bye! Y'all didn't say bye to Tony. - Tommy La La can't sing a lick. - Why'd you tell him that? [Woody] # Roll on, Citroen # # Roll on Roll on down the road # - [Whining] - What'd you hit me for? - [Nate Whining] - Y'all, cut that out. - Hey, hey, hey. - It's not funny. - # Roll on down the road # - I'll tell Mommy. # Now Troy's gonna be with Cousin Viola # # And Nate's gonna be with Cousin Sam # Can't wait. Finally have some peace and quiet in the house. # Roll on, Citroen Roll on # # Roll on, Citroen, roll on # # Roll on down the road # How many times you gonna sing that same old song? - Y'all don't like my song? - [All] No! You know, I'm glad the kids are comin' South. I'm tired. Don't know what's wrong, but I'm tired. Woody, we need to make some changes. The money I'm bringin' in is not makin' ends meet. I need your help. You want me to, uh, pick up a guitar and play some rock 'n' roll? Yes. If it'll help pay Con Ed, yes. [Sighs] This concert's gonna change a lot of things for us, Gem. Plus it's gonna bring in a nice piece of change. Who's gonna come but us, Uncle Brown, Aunt Maxine and our friends? People are gonna come to this concert. People still want to hear good music. I don't give a damn how many records rock 'n' roll sells. People know the difference... between that and good, pure music. I need you to support me in this, Carolyn. Oh... Looka here. Who gets up at the crack of dawn... Monday through Friday, cookin' breakfast, go to school, teach school, come home, cook dinner, grade papers, make lesson plans, try to keep our rowdy kids from killin' each other... just so you can be a "pure" musician playin' "pure" music? If that ain't support, I don't know what the hell... what is. - Thank you. - [Coughs] You woke up Troy. You satisfied? - What's the matter? Can't you sleep? - No. - You want to come up here with us? - Yeah. - Oh, whoa. - You have long legs. Whoo, Miss Coomish Mimmish. Troy, aren't you the lucky one. Aunt Song and Uncle Clem said Viola's beside herself that you're comin' down here. [Troy] When am I coming home? - In a few weeks. - Will the lights be back on? Oh, yeah, baby. All the lights will be back on. - I don't wanna go. - Troy, come on, come on. You're gonna have a wonderful time. Please? Just this once? [Whispering] [Horn Honking "Shave And A Haircut"] [Horn Honking] [Song] Lord, have mercy, will y'all look at this. - Whoa. - [Women Talking Indistinctly] I'm sure y'all are tired. Lord, have mercy. Y'all done brought your dog too. Oh, Viola, why don't you put Queenie in the family room? - Family room? - Man! You sure got a clean house. Oh, isn't that cute. Clem, you hear what Clinton said? - Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah. - I'm Wendell. - I'm Clinton. Well, shut my mouth wide open. Oh, Carolyn, I just love yours and Troy's hair. Will you look at that? All those little tiny braids and things. What y'all call that? Braids. Oh, no, sugar. We don't let the dogs in here. This carpet's too nice. - Boy, take that dog outside. Put him in the car. - What? - Nate. - Come on, Mutley. Viola, ain't you gonna say hello to your cousin Troy? Troy, you didn't say hi? - Hi. - Hi. She's just a little shy. - Get off the couch. Woody! - I could use some coffee. Oh, shoot, I don't mind. We are all family. Who's hungry? I got some fried chicken and potato salad in the kitchen right out there. - Oh, man! - Hey! [Woody] You ain't changed. You have not changed. - [Song] Go on. - Come on, Troy. - Aunt Song, you sure can cook. - Why, thank you, sugar. Lord, Troy, you don't know how happy we are to have you here with us. Troy, we're gonna have us some fun. Carolyn, - Troy can stay as long as she wants. - Oh, Song, that's so nice. - Troy, isn't that nice? - Yeah. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Woody, we need to get on the road. We still have to drop Nate off at Trudy and Boo's. All right, y'all. Finish your plates. We got about two hours to go. [Clem] How soon you gettin' back to New York? - This food's good. - Day after tomorrow. Will you please try and cooperate with everybody... - and get along with everybody? - I don't want to stay here. Troy, you're gonna have a great time. I wish I was stayin'. Just don't leave me here. I hardly know these people. They're your relatives. Come on. I'm the one you ought to feel sorry for. I have to go up there with all those boys. Thank you! Good-bye! [All Chattering] - Bye, Troy! - [Woody] I love you, baby. - Bye! See you. - Take care of yourself. Bye, Little Joe. - [Song] Let's go inside, Troy. - Please don't leave me. - Mommy, don't leave me. - Come on, Troy. Let's go inside, baby. [Horn Toots] When you're getting dressed for bed, I have often heard it said... before you go to sleep, you have to put away your clothes, - [Snarling] - Because if you're going to do things, - do things right. - [Song] Queenie, is Mama's baby gonna be nice to Troy? Troy, honey, where are your pajamas? [Record Continues] May I be excused? And they'll say... "Yes!" to you. Lord, have mercy, honey. You can't wear these. Viola, give Troy one of your nighties. I'm gonna throw these things in the garbage. - Yes, Mama. - [Record] Get up. Wake up. Get there on time for school. Don't you be late. Find your place. Win the race. - Here, Troy. - Go change in the bathroom, sugar. Sugar, you ain't got a thing to hide with your skinny self. Thinner than a blade of grass. - Viola, you got your bra on? - Yes. Come on. All right, you rascals, let's say our prayers. Viola, put Queenie on the floor. [Both] Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. Amen. All right, now, I want you two right to sleep. All right. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite. So glad you're here, Troy. We gonna have lots of fun. - Good night, hon. - Good night, Daddy. - Good night, Troy. - Good night, Uncle Clem. Night-night. I ain't no puta. I keep my pajamas clean. - I ain't no puta. I keep my pajamas clean. - [Giggling] I keeps my pajamas clean. [Song] Viola, what's that noise in there? Nothin', Mama. You better stop jumpin'... - before she comes in. - I don't care. I hate this place anyway. Besides, my dog could kill your little rat dog. I don't care either, and it ain't my dog; it's Mama's dog. - You like livin' in Brooklyn? - A lot better than here. You should come visit me. Good. I like Aunt Carolyn. It's okay if you don't like Aunt Song. She's not my real mother. I was adopted. You were? What's that funny noise outside? - You ain't never heard crickets before? - Good night. Lord, have mercy, child. You sure got one thick head of hair. You need a hot comb on these naps. You ain't got good hair like my baby. - [Hair Sizzling] - Ow! Now don't tell me you got the nerve to be tender-headed with these naps. [Chuckling] - What's those things you and your mother had? - Beads and braids. Beads and braids. Lord, have mercy.

I told you. - [Song] There you go, always takin' her side. For Christ's sake, let Troy open up her presents, please, honey. Goddamn! - [Viola] Ooh. - It's a dress. Yes, it's from me and your Uncle Clem. Ain't that pretty? You are going to wear that today. - Oh. Thank you. - Happy birthday, Troy. Thank you. It's a training bra. - You not gonna need that for quite a while. - Ahem! Oh, this came in the mornin' mail. It's for you. - It's from my mommy. - [Song] Oh, yeah! What'd she say? I hope she don't mind about me takin' out those braids and things. - I didn't know what else to do. - Let's let her read her letter in peace. Come on, everybody. Let's make breakfast, hmm? Viola? Let's go. - Jade. - [Carolyn's Voice] Dear ladybug: Happy birthday. The mailman just tapped on the window, and I got your letter. Hooray! I'm glad to hear you're havin' such a wonderful time down there. Could this be true? Although you've been gone only a month, it feels like an eternity. - Minnie wanted to know: - When will Troy be back from down South? [Carolyn] All the boys are still on the stoop playin' Strat-o-Matic baseball. What a waste of time. And Tommy still can't sing. [Off-key] # Yester-you # # Listen to me # # La-la-la-la La-la-la la-la means # # I love you # [Carolyn] Last night we had yet another run-in with Tony. Vic Powell didn't slap him this time. Your father was there, thank God. Wendell has been telling me that every morning Tony throws trash from his sidewalk... onto our stoop. We finally caught him red-handed. What the hell you think you're doin'? Throwing this trash back. Who told you to throw it here in the first place? - How do you know it was us? - You did it to your own stink house. - I know exactly what happened. - You're the one who's always throwin' garbage. [Carolyn] You know how it is on our block. A little shouting starts. Before you know it, you got a big crowd wantin' a show. - [Arguing] - Wendell, what's goin' on? Caught him throwin' trash over there. I expect more from a grown man. What do you think you're doin'? Your children are constantly over here throwin' their trash on my property. - True. - And furthermore, they go on the roof, and throw rocks down on my dogs. - Untrue. - Machine gun, machine gun, machine gun! [Shouting] - Are you doing this? - Are you gonna believe this man? Yeah, you gonna believe this stinky over us? My children are doing no such thing. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. You should start actin' like an adult and cut this foolishness out. Tony, I hate to tell you this, but your house stinks. That's the truth. Why you house stink, man? [All Laughing] - [Speaking Spanish] - Hey, you up there. Hey, mister number four. Mira, mira. Where's my rent? - I want to talk to you. - When you gonna pay the rent? You want me to, I'll come over. I'll help try to straighten up, but this situation got to stop. I smell your animals all in my house. You understand me? Okay. Here. [Carolyn] Aren't you glad to be away from these crazy people in Crooklyn, New York? And now, about your father. It started with Clinton. You're the eldest. I expect more from you, but I'm gonna let you make your own decision. Man, why did Daddy have to have his concert tonight, the night of the NBA championships? - Dang! - Which is more important? [Brown] All right! Nice! - Was that some new stuff tonight, brother? - Yeah, man. [Carolyn] You ought to record it, Woody. I plan to. I also started working on my folk opera. [Maxine] Folk opera? About what, Woody? - What you laughin' at? - Jessica was laughing. She's from the city. My folk opera is about me growin' up in Alabama. [Brown] All right. You got the material for it. - You know that's right. - [Laughing] Doin' it right! We were all trying very hard to lift your father's spirits. And it was working, until: [Door Slamming] The Knicks are world champs. We got some ice cream and cake right here. - Clinton. - I'm not hungry. [Footsteps Ascending Stairs] And the Knicks won. How 'bout that? [Carolyn] I've enclosed some gifts for you and Viola. Ladybug, we all miss you dreadfully. I miss you. Love, Mommy. P.S. We got the lights turned back on, thanks to Uncle Brown, who is also buying your plane ticket home. - Please write and thank him... - "Please write to him and thank him immediately." [Song] Queenie! Queenie! I don't know where she's run off to. - Well, here she is, the birthday girl. - These are for you. - Thank you. - Did your mother send you those? - Mm-hmm. They're jade. - Oh. Aren't they pretty. What are they? Little elephants? Look, Mama. Aunt Carolyn sent me some also. Oh, well, Viola, you don't have pierced ears. - You know how I feel about that. - But Troy has pierced ears. Well, Troy was also wearin' them funny... braids and beads and shells and things. - You don't ever let me do what I want to do. - I want to go home. - Beg pardon? - I'm going home. Now, Troy, no need to get upset. Everybody has a little argument now and then. Uh, your Aunt Song didn't mean nothin' about your hair and your earrings. - Did you, honey? - [Troy] I don't care! - See what you did? - Lord, have mercy. Troy! How would it look if you left now? Aunt Song has a big mouth sometimes. You want your folks to think we done scared you back up North? If she goes, I go. Troy, Aunt Song loves you and your family. Clem, do something! Now look, folks. Troy wants to go home, Troy's goin' home. - That's all there is to it. - Troy? [Pitifully] At least stay for the birthday party I've prepared. - Song. Fix us some breakfast. - [Troy] All right. Queenie! Queenie! Queenie, where are you? - [Crying] Oh, Lord, have mercy. - [Clem] Come on back in here. Where is my baby? Queenie! Where are you? Jesus, Master, where is my child? Queenie! Queenie, where are you? Queenie? Where are you, baby? [Laughing] Stop that! Please! - Did you find her, Mama? - I just don't understand where my baby is. It's not like Queenie just to up and disappear. Why, Lord, why? - She'll be back, Aunt Song. - Don't worry. Queenie'll show up. It's gettin' late, y'all. Everybody have enough ice cream and cake? - [All] Yes. - Everybody brush their teeth and wash their hands? - [All] Yes. - All right, help me pull this bed out. Come on. Move! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Pick up the pillow. Viola, help 'em with the pillows. Get out of here, Judy, Jody... Whatever your names are. [Screaming] Oh, dear God! Oh, God, take me right now. I don't want to live anymore without my baby. [Sobbing] Queenie! [Sobbing] [Sobbing] Oh, God! Queenie! [Crying] [Sniffling] Looks like it's gonna rain. That means that my baby is in heaven. - [Sobbing] - Troy, I'll go get your bags. Bye, Aunt Song. - I'm sorry about Queenie. - [Sobbing] Maybe you could come stay with me sometime. I'd like that. Bye, Queenie. Sorry you got squashed to death in the sofa, even though I hated your guts. - [Engine Starting] - [Clem] Let her go, Viola. All right, let's go. # Every time I think I've had enough # # And start heading for the door # # There's a very strange vibration piercing me right through the core # # It says Turn around, you fool # - Bye, Viola. - Bye, Troy. # Tell me why # - # Is it so # - Yeah, goin' back to bad old Brooklyn. # Don't wanna let you go I never can say good-bye, girl # # Ooh-hoo, baby # # I never can say good-bye # # No-no-no, no-no-no Whoo # # Oh, I never can say good-bye, girl # - Hi, little ladybug. - Hi. Welcome home. - Hi. - Hi. How do, Miss Coomish Mimmish? How was your flight? - Good. Where's Daddy? - He had to go to rehearsal. Your mother asked us to pick you up. Here's a little gift. - She didn't want to ride? - Naw, she was busy. - What happened to your hair? - Aunt Song didn't like my braids, and she took 'em out. Oh, goodness. Carolyn Carmichael's gonna have a fit when she sees this, huh? - Well, you ready to go? - Mm-hmm. - [Maxine] Has Woody been there all day? - [Brown] Since this mornin'. So you were ready to come on home, Troy. You had enough of the South. - I don't blame you one bit. - Mm-hmm. It's too slow. Y'all don't know what y'all missin' growin' up in the South. I'm glad I missed it. Troy, when was your birthday? - Yesterday. - Oh. So how old are you now? Eight? - Ten. - No! How's my brother Clem, Aunt Song and Viola doin'? Good. Thanks for the ticket. I didn't get a chance to write. - You're very welcome. - That's what family's for. Gotta stick together, right? - Right. - Sure you're right. [Maxine] Troy, we're going to make a quick stop before we take you home. - [Troy] Who's sick? - [Maxine] It's nothing serious, dear. It's Mommy, isn't it? - Well, it's just she hadn't been feelin' too well lately. - What's wrong with her? We don't know yet, Troy. The doctors are running tests. How come she didn't tell me? How come nobody told me? Because no one wanted you to worry yourself silly, and your mother didn't think there was any cause for alarm. Where's Daddy? He's in there with your mother. - Hey! Miss Coomish Mimmish! - Hi, Daddy! Hey, baby. Troy's back. Hmm? Oh! Oh, ladybug. Hi! Hi. Hmm? Hi, Mommy. How you feelin'? - Who did that to your hair? - Aunt Song. Aunt So... Oh, shit, I knew she would. [Coughing] Come on. Give me a big hug. I missed you. - So much! - I missed you too. Even my brothers. Gee, you must have been lonesome if you missed them. Mommy, you work too hard. I can start helpin' you. I can cook and clean. I don't even care if nobody else helps me. - Got to get your rest. - That's very kind of you. Come here. You know, I need you... to watch out for Joseph, your little brother. He's the youngest. He's your responsibility. You promise me? Come here. [Whispering] I promise. Woody, go get the car. I'm ready to go home. - Okay. - You're comin' home now? - Mm-hmm. - Really? [Woody] Let's go, Troy. - Get the car. - Okay. Your car. Aunt Song kinda weird, huh? Yeah. They talk funny down there. What do you mean they talk funny down there? [Exaggerated Accent] Oh, yeah. Hey. Where'd those trees come from? Your mother. She got the block association to put some life on this street. - [Honking Horn] - Hey! Clinton! Wendell! Looka here. Don't she look good? - [All] Yeah! - [Clinton] Look at that hair. - Hey, Tommy, turn that junk off now. - Oh, come on. Tired of you playin' that garbage on my stoop. - It's the Chi-Lites. - Yeah, I know. Chi nothin'. - You want some help? [Buzzing Noise] - Quit it. - Didn't expect to see you here for at least another two weeks. - Get off! - Hey, leave her alone. - Hey, Clinton, grab this bag. - Can't you see I'm busy? - Boy, you better come get these bags. She should carry her own bags. # They say Let the woman take care of you # # So I try to be hip # # And think like the crowd # # But even the crowd can't help me now # # Oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh # # Oh, girl # # Tell me what am I gonna do # - Come on, Mutley. - # I know I've got a guilty face # # Girl, I feel so out of place # # Oh, yeah, yeah # # Don't know where to go who to see, yeah ## [TV Announcer] So great was the beauty of this magnificent black woman, it has become legendary.

There ain't no need to be afraid. Your mother's gonna be fine. But she gonna have to stay in there for a while. - It's not fair. - I know it ain't fair, but it's gonna be all right. - [Children Crying] - Listen to me now. All y'all, listen to me now. Come on.

Troy, why don't you at least try it on, okay? Please, ladybug. Don't be difficult, okay? I know this is hard for you. It's hard for everybody. But you have to wear something nice. Don't you want to look all pretty like Aunt Maxine? Carolyn would be so proud of you. Listen, my mother hates polyester. She would never let me wear anything like that. Right, Troy. - # Get yourself go # - Get Cheerios! - Troy? - What? - Let's go. - I'm not goin'. Sh-sh-shit. - Troy, baby, what are you doin'? - I'm sick. - Troy, you got everybody waitin' on you. - So? Miss Coomish Mimmish, please don't make this any more difficult than it has to be.

Ain't no reason tryin' right now. Oh, yes, there is. Your mother would want... everybody to be at the church... together. - Will you do that for me? - Yeah. I want you to get yourself together.

Come on, Joseph. - There they are: The Possums! - Who said it? Who took your money? Over there! Snuffy and Right Hand Man! - [Troy Howling] - Whoa! Snuffy, that's what you get. Troy, what you do that for? We're tired of being terrorized by you and Right Hand.

You're hurting me! - Be quiet. Doesn't hurt. If you combed it a little more often, it wouldn't be lookin' all like a sheep's behind. But it never hurt when Mommy combed it. - I'm sorry, Joseph, but I'm not Mommy. - Ow. Dear ladybug: How are you? I miss you so very much. I can't believe you just turned ten! All of you kids are growing up so rapidly. Ladybug, you turned out pretty good considering you were raised in a house... - full of ashy, rusty-butt boys. - Ow! Can Joseph come out and play? - Troy, can he come out? - All right. Don't go too far. Dinner's almost ready. Okay, I don't want to embarrass you. [Boys Talking Indistinctly] Come on! Let's play!
