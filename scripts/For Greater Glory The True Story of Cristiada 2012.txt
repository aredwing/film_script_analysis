Corre! Corre! Compatriotas, Mxico is under siege. A plot as insidious as it is dangerous threatens our nation. Outcasts from Rome and from all over Europe are coming into our country to destabilize the government, to poison the minds and hearts of our people, to turn them into fanatics at the service of foreign interests. This situation, this evil, this threat cannot be ignored, and it will not be tolerated. Therefore I have instructed our Congress to create a set of laws designed to deal with this national emergency. Camine. PRESIDENTE CALLES: Firstly, every foreign-born bishop, priest or minister will be deported immediately. Second, there will be a five-year jail sentence for any priest who criticizes the government. The wearing of religious vestments in public is strictly forbidden. Make no mistake. This government is going to do whatever is necessary to preserve the dignity of Mxico, the freedom of its people and the immortal ideals of La Revolucin Mexicana. [ music playing ] [ giggles ] [ laughter ] Muchachos! Don't waste God's good food making fun of me. [ growls ] [ growls ] [ music stops ] I-I'm ashamed of you. He's a man of God. Padre. Padre. Jose will work for you for the next two weeks, Padre. Anything you need him to do for the church. That won't be necessary. It was a harmless prank. And I hear fruit is good for the hair. I-I know that the priests consider prayer a penitence, but for a boy like my godson, hard work is better. Uh, you've no doubt, uh, heard about the Calles Law. Yes. Just be careful about wearing your cassock in public. God save us from these heathens. Have you had breakfast, Joselito? Elodia makes wonderful chilaquiles, and my friend Father Vega will be here any minute. Don't call me Joselito. Oh, that's right. You're tough. I forgot. The soldiers are coming into towns, making sure the laws are being enforced. I came from Europe over 70 years ago, when I was just 7 years old. Would they really kick out an old man like me? From what I hear, they probably will. There have been spontaneous protests all over Mxico. A resistance is forming, and Rome, uh--Rome is taking too long to respond. An armed resistance? Let's pray it doesn't come to that. But... [ sighs ] It may become inevitable. That's a mistake. Our Savior is the Prince of Peace. But the Bible also says there is a time for peace, a time for war. We cannot allow the godless to take away our freedom. If need be, we must stand up and resist. Even if I were younger, I would not fight. You won't need to fight to help. You can feed and shelter the ones who come through. Now, that I would do. [ chuckles ] Listo? MAN: Listo, Su Excelencia. His Holiness Pope Pius XI condemns the Calles Law. Beginning midnight on August 1 st, all holy services in Mxico will be suspended. [ crowd gasps ] MAN: No puede ser. [ music playing ] [ chanting ] Respeto derecho de fe! Respeto derecho de fe! What beautiful little girl is gonna beat me in chess today? Me. - You? - Yes. Okay, we'll see. Peridico! Peridico! The cathedral is being closed at the orders of President Calles so the government can make an inventory and safeguard its contents. [ crowd murmuring ] Let's go. The girls will not be able to get their confirmation, Enrique. It's only temporary, Tulita. Calles won't be able to sustain this. Besides, I was sure our daughters will survive without the, uh, nuns slapping their palms, all that holy nonsense. It is not a joke. It may mean nothing to you, but it means everything to me. Daddy, does that mean no more catechism? So we can play now? You can study science for now. You know how important this is to me. It's only temporary. Besides, I'm sure there'll be plenty of clandestine services. Oh, so the girls can feel like they are doing something shameful when they go to Mass? [ sighs ] What do you want me to do? Come. Tula. Tula. Go look at the hats. Tulita... as a military man, I can tell you that it's only a matter of time before Calles is overthrown. In the meantime, you can teach the girls at home. Unless, of course, you want me to. Excuse me. Hi. For the repeal of the Calles Law. Oh, excellent. Thank you. Good luck. Excuse me, sir. Please, for the repeal of the Calles Law. [ sighs ] Please don't misunderstand me. I'm a good Catholic. But you're wasting your time. Excuse me? What good do you think this will do? Calles can't ignore a million signatures. I'm sorry to say he can and he will. But on the other hand, an economic boycott, that would be quite a different matter. ANACLETO: Brilliant, Adriana. This is a brilliant idea. [ chuckles ] Thank you, but it wasn't mine. It is very, very ambitious. But why not? A big sacrifice. Only buy what we absolutely need. A type of Lent, but this will attest to our faith. And it will humble Calles. [ door opens ] Hello, Jose. It seems Dr. Limn has lost his watch. Have you found anything while you've been sweeping? No, Padre. Oh. He must have lost it somewhere else. You're a good sweeper, Jose, but I think you'd be a better altar boy. Well done. I'm proud of you. [ kiss ] [ chanting in Spanish ] What did I tell you? [ chanting outside ] You cannot be soft with these people. They confuse reason with weakness. I showed restraint. What did they do? Become more rebellious, more insolent. The purpose of this boycott is very evident. They want to wreck the economy and bring our government down. [ overlapping conversations ] Congress rejected the petition. There will be no stopping the uprisings now. The boycott is working. They're afraid, and it's showing. It's not easy. We have thousands of supporters all over the country. We can do this. So, I tried. Followed your advice. Did not work. So now, the next message I send will be unmistakably clear. Alto ya! Vamos! Ya! Vamos ya! Aydanos! Ms duro! [ yelling ] Saquen los nios! Sangre de Cristo! [ gunfire, yelling ] No! No! Stop it! No! [ gunfire ] [ yelling fades ] [ footsteps ] Thank God, Adriana. You're so lucky. They thought you were dead. Calles is a monster. I know. We must find another peaceful solution. Anacleto, the armed conflict has already begun. I say we support the rebellion. They'll need food, medicine. And ammunition. We can support them with communication and funds... [ murmuring ] but we will not fight. I kneel the first time. Ring. [ rings bell ] Then when I bring the Host up here, ring the bell. [ rings bell ] And then I go down again. Right? [ sighs ] Finally. He's teaching me to be an altar boy. You? I thought you were being punished. Hmm. Don Enrique, we have a problem with milling machine four. Grab those there. Ay. [ laughs ] Beautiful. Look at this. Charles Lindbergh crosses the Atlantic solo. Me? I am here, going mad surrounded by pink soap. You have a beautiful family and enough memories of battle to last a lifetime. Memories. You live in your memories, you're already dead. GIRL: I saw you at the church. Are you a gardener now? JOSE: Maybe an altar boy. Really? Marilena! I'll see you later. [ bell tolling ] [ horse neighs ] [ galloping hoofbeats ] The federales are coming! They're coming! [ overlapping chatter ] Padre, the federal soldiers are coming. You must hide. Hide? I'm too old to hide. Please, Father, come with me. You can hide at our house. Would I hide from God? This is my home. I'm safe here, Joselito. Jose, who are you if you don't stand up for what you believe? There is no greater glory than to give your life for Christ. Now... go. Please, Father. Go, and run fast. God bless you. [ overlapping chatter ] [ door crashes open ] Let this be a lesson to any of you who help the traitorous Cristeros. [ officer speaking Spanish ] Ya! [ officer speaking Spanish ] Ya! [ rifles clatter ] Apunten... ya! Stop. Fuego! Jose. Mi amor. [ kiss ] Ests bien? [ kiss ] Thank the Lord. [ kiss ] Mi amor. [ kiss ] They killed Father Christopher. I told him he could come here. He wouldn't come with me. I should have made him come with me. Jose... it was very brave of you to try. Can't Godfather punish them? Your padrino's a mayor... but even he has no power over the federales. Anacleto Gonzlez Flores? Yes? This is the most I could get. Umberto, God bless you. [ laughs ] We need to take five belts each if you can. Let me show you. Hello, Padre. It is prohibited to say Mass, Padre Robles. I forgive you, my son. [ crashing, gunfire ] Ya! [ man speaking Spanish ] [ laughter ] [ shouting ] Captain. [ Captain groaning ] Please. What do you want? Money? I can get you money. Spend it in hell, cabrn. [ wood scrapes ] [ gasps ] [ spits ] We have over 20,000 men who call themselves defenders or populists. Most don't even know of each other's existence. That's why we need a commander in chief and a central command. What about your military friends? Well, they suggested Enrique Gorostieta... an experienced, decorated general and strategist. He defeated Zapata. I know of him. I doubt he's sympathetic to our cause. I don't even think he's Catholic. We are not hiring him to pray. He is a great man capable of doing great things. Close your eyes, and sleep with the angels. I'll try. Okay. [ clatter ] Close your eyes. [ shards tinkling ] My mother brought us that vase from Sevilla. Sorry, Mother. [ coyotes howling ] [ horse neighs ] MAN: You looking for me? [ bullets whizzing ] [ gunfire stops ] [ clatter ] [ yells ] [ insects chirping ] He has to be dead. Let's go in. You go first. Okay? Come on. [ yelling ] Come out, cabrn. Got you surrounded. [ horses galloping ] We heard they rode by Chucho's. We came as fast as we could. Are you all right? Who else came to help you? Go get the rest of the guns and the ammunition and their horses. We're Cristeros now, boys! [ shouts ] How many? - Six. - Six. Four here. Four there. [ chuckles ] Catorce. Catorce. Miguel Gomez Loza. Enrique Gorostieta. Sit down, please. I represent the National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty. Maybe you have heard us referred to as the League. I have heard you called by another name, Cristeros. Surely you don't support Calles. No. He's a barbarian and a fool. There are uprisings all around the country. Over 20,000 men, but no leader. No leader? I am not what you might call a devout believer. We propose to hire you to turn our armed resistance into a formidable army. An army? I thank you, sir, for a most generous offer. Okay, let's make an army. Let's make a, uh, formidable army out of a group of ragtag peasants in huaraches... out of a few game ranchers, out of some tenderfooted clergy who are trembling at the thought of holding a weapon for the first time. You want me to make a national guard out of that? Look at me. Do you have proper weapons? No. Do you have an ammunition supply? No. Do you have a central command? No. How many is that? Three no's. All you have is belief, and belief will not save them in battle. A central command? The League has an extensive secret network all over Mxico. Weapons, ammunition? From dissenters within the army itself and soldiers we have defeated. Surely you have read about our victories in your paper. And your defeats. General, that's why we want to hire you. And suppose I'm interested in your offer. What are your finances? You gonna pay me in prayers? Tell me what you want, and I will bring it back to the League. I don't think the Cristeros can afford me. The question here is, where does the finest general in Mxico want to serve? [ sniffs ] If I don't take these photographs, who will? Who will record this barbarity that wouldn't be believed? Why didn't they shoot you? Heh. I always promise them a portrait. [ clatter outside ] Miguel. Miijo, what happened? Are you all right? Yes, Father. There was a big battle. Bullet went right through my ankle. They killed my horse. Hi. I will get Dr. Limn. No, no, no, no. It's better if no one knows. No one will know. I have known him for almost 30 years. [ laughs ] Will he be all right? Yes. Boys, time to go. Don't tell anyone what you saw here. - Viva! - [ cheering ] Viva Cristo Rey! Viva El Catorce! [ cheering continues ] El Catorce! El Catorce! El Catorce! [ kiss ] [ kiss ] There you go, Padre. Thank you, Pablo. [ horses neighing ] The legendary El Catorce. Victoriano Ramirez. My brother Pablo. Hey. They should be here, Pablo. Bring them inside. Where is the general? I'm sorry. I didn't introduce myself. General Jose Reyes Vega. You're General Vega? Yes. You're a priest. I'm a priest. [ both laughing ] A priest general, huh? Oh. All right. Some water? Uh, what else do you have? Some tequila. Help yourself. [ laughs ] You know, I-- [ chuckles ] I heard that your last battle didn't go so well. Now I know why. Really? Maybe-- Maybe priests shouldn't be generals. Hmm? Of course, we didn't know you would be fighting so close. Did you know that you drove the federales right into our camp when we were completely unprepared? You were completely unprepared? And this is my fault? I'm saying we should be working together. [ sniffs ] Under whose command? The League appointed me commander. Well, I don't know anything about any League, Padre. I'm fighting for Cristo Rey y la Virgen de Guadalupe. And I'm responsible for my own men. Together, we would be much stronger. We'll stay out of your way. We're going to Autln. Jose, women are here with ammunition. Bring Adriana in. The what? The women with the ammunition. Que viva Cristo Rey, Padre. Que viva. I also brought three nurses. God bless you, Adriana. God bless you, and thank you, ladies. You are as important to this war as any soldier. - Gracias, Padre. - S, Padre. God bless you. Padre. Excuse me, Padre. You think that's right to involve the women like this? Our Catholic sisters are a big part of this war. Without them bringing ammunition, food, taking care of the wounded, all would be lost. Ah. [ chuckles ] All right. Do you need ammo, guns? No, no, no. You keep the ladies' ammunition, Padre. We've got plenty from the federales we've killed. [ glassware clinking ] TULITA: What is the occasion? Hmm. - Salud. - Salud. An attorney for the League representing the Cristeros came to see me today. They want to hire me to command their rebellion. You? Yes. Well, how ironic. You cannot fight for something you don't believe in. I may have issues with the Church, but I believe in religious freedom. And I believe in you. And if I'm successful, the church bells will ring freely again, and our girls, they can continue their catechism. You are really considering this? Yes. Tulita, I have asked them for 3,000 pesos a month. That's twice what the federal generals make. Plus 50,000 in insurance for you and the girls. They've agreed to everything. I'm not gonna die. So you have it all figured out? And where do I and the girls fit in this? Tulita, listen to me. I'm dying here. I'm a military man. You knew that when you married me. You a Cristero? You are an atheist. GOROSTIETA: Are you awake? Yes. You were right. It would be hypocritical. I'm going to turn 'em down. You may have nothing you believe in, but I do. I believe in what you would be fighting for. Maybe by doing it, you will, too. Just come back to me, General... to us... to the loving man I married. I promise. CALLES: The American secretary of State-- Cmo se llama el gringo ese? Mr. Kellogg. Kellogg... is making the outrageous remark that Bolshevik forces are at work in Mxico and stating that we have to guarantee the life and property of every U.S. citizen in Mxico. What does he think I am? Mxico will not tolerate foreign governments meddling in our internal affairs. Thank you for coming. Not at all. Dwight, do you speak any Spanish? Just a little. Look, I'll be blunt. Our ambassador to Mexico has botched things, badly. You revamped the aviation policy. You've been General Pershing's right-hand man. I think you can handle ambassador to Mexico. Cal. Cal, my dear friend, I'm honored. Don't answer now. Think about it. Talk it over with Elizabeth. [ chuckles ] What's the real story? President Calles is repealing the Bucareli Agreements. are finished. And what would you like me to do, Mr. President? What you always do. Fix it. Let's be frank. You called them Bolsheviks. [ chuckles ] I was simply calling a spade a spade. Would you have us just roll over and let them steal our oil fields? And just how do you think offending them is gonna help our cause? President Coolidge wants a diplomatic approach. I'm convinced he's right. Half of Europe just became the Soviet Union. We need Mexico in more ways than one. Well, I warn you from experience that there's no negotiating with Calles. Thank you for your assessment and your advice, but I am the current ambassador to Mexico. The results of your tenure speak for themselves. Now, why am I getting all this pressure from the Knights of Columbus about this conflict between Calles and the Church? Conflict? Oh, that's nothing. [ birds squawking ] [ train whistle blowing ] We're Cristeros, and we're taking the gold off this train. Viva Cristo Rey. [ kiss ] You see? Que viva. It's all right. Stand aside. [ whistle blowing ] That's it. Excellent, Pablo. [ passengers screaming ] [ women sobbing ] CRISTERO: We are only after the gold. We are Cristeros. Don't be afraid. [ bell ringing ] Get the passengers off the train. [ chuckles ] - [ laughs ] - You did it, Pablito. Well done! Pablo! Pablo! Pablo. Pablo. No, no. Pablo. CRISTERO: Ac. Francisco. Francisco! Take the dynamite. Blow the safe. Clear the people from this area! ndale! Forma fila! Muvase! Muvase! Clear this area! We're blowing the safe! Camine! Camine! Come on. Vmonos! It's lit, sir. Muvete! Muvete! Are all the passengers out? Are all the passengers out? Yes, sir, they are. Then what are you waiting for? Set fire to this train! ndale! Aprate! Hgale! Hgale! We got it, all of it. [ overlapping chatter ] [ man screams ] MAN: Fuego! [ people screaming ] These so-called Cristeros burned hundreds of innocent people alive. The Mexican government has proof that the Roman Catholic Episcopate ordered this atrocity. Bishops have agreed to leave the country, avoiding responsibility, and abandon Mxico. General, everything's ready. You can communicate to troops in any area through us. Our best undercover operative will accompany you. This is for you. And viva Cristo Rey. Caballeros, General Enrique Gorostieta. And what's this catrn you hire Iike you hire a whore gonna do for us? Who is this ranch hand who has already decided that his military strategy is better than that of a twice-decorated general who fought with Huerta? Why should we trust you? Because I know how to lead an army. This is not about killing 1 4, Victoriano Ramirez. It's about winning the war, and war is chess. Teniente. I've been following this war very closely. The federales, they control the trains and the towns the trains go through. The outlying towns and villages will be ours. There will be no reason to fight Iined up in front of each other like ancient knights. We will fight with lightning attacks from the wings, and before they know what happened to them, the Cristeros will be gone. We will not attack from one side, but from two and sometimes three, Iike a jimador and his machete. Understood? How many armed men and cavalry do we have? General Vega. I know who you are. I have 4,000 men and 1 00 cavalry. Good. General Pedroza. I have 2,000 at your service, comandante. I have 700 armed rancheros on horseback, and I will command my own men. And you will take orders from me. Like hell, I will. Then why are you here? I don't know. Well, I do. You wanted to meet me. You knew that we needed a central command, and you wanted to see what kind of man I was. So I will tell you, and I will tell you all. I am a veteran of two wars, and I was promoted to general when I was very young... for a specific reason, because I have a gift. Yes, I have a gift-- for military strategy. And he's humble, too. I am now the commander of this army. If you don't show respect, you can go. Now. Go. Go to the hills, and continue to fight. Raid villages until you are shot or hanged. Go. So you stay. Good. General Vega. The entire world has heard about the priest who burned people alive. You gave Calles exactly what he needed, a way to demonize us, so now public support for our cause has been severely compromised. Those are more of Calles' lies. Lies? They have raped and killed women in front of their children, marched them for days and days, Ieft them to die in corrals like diseased cattle. They have taken priests-- So you're here for revenge? Is that it, Padre? Is that why you're here? Because if you are, you can go home and pray to God that He may forgive you. Because we are now an army. We are an army fighting for God and for the Church... and for absolute freedom. We must work together, me and you. We might die together, me and you. But we will fight with honor... and dignity... and with cunning... and by the grace of God... we will be victorious. Viva Cristo Rey. [ strikes ] [ sobs ] God bless you, Father. Now all the devils burning in hell will enjoy your art. Stop! - Please, sir, stop! - Stop what? Mayor Picazo is my padrino. Mayor Picazo knows we are here. Please, sir, I'm begging you. Get out of here. Get out of here! Padrino! They have Miguel. They're going to kill him. I know. I know, Jose. I know, uh-- I know all about him. He is a well-known Cristero. He killed a federal sergeant. They've been waiting for him to come back to that subversive father of his. But his father never did anything. Don't think I don't know where you were last night. And I saved your life this time, Jose, but I'm warning you. These are dark times. I won't be able to do it again. Now get out. We're going to join the Cristeros. [ scoffs ] Cristeros. How? They'll say we're too young. They won't take us. Not if we tell them they will kill us here. Come on, Lalo. You and me, together. [ sighs ] [ brakes squealing ] [ bell ringing ] [ object clatters ] [ bullet rolls ] [ soldier speaking nearby ] Not ours. Where did you find it, son? There. Someone's smuggling ammunition. - Check the station. - Open your bag. [ train whistle blows ] What's going on? They've raided and closed every one of the League offices. Many have been arrested, and God knows how many have been tortured or killed by now. We need your help. I can't help you. The more and more I think, Anacleto was right. All this violence has gotten us nowhere. I understand. But I need you to take this to Gorostieta. No, Miguel. Adriana, this is critical, contact information for all our principal members. Without this, there will be no central command. You would go without saying goodbye? I can't stay here, Mother. Not while my friends and brothers are joining the Cristeros. I need to fight. Que Nuestra Seora de Guadalupe... te bendiga, mi amor. May she watch over... and protect you. T ell Papa I love him. You will need a horse. Are you ready? Let's go. Calles' revenge. Revenge for what I did. Yes! Revenge for what you did! Teniente. General. These Christians must be buried. Today we will become an army of gravediggers. [ praying in Latin ] [ Father Vega chanting in Latin ] [echoing the chant ] You think it suits me? Well... anything that covers that face of yours. [ laughter ] - Mm. - Gracias, seora. De nada. De nada. [ pounding on door ] Oh, it must be Seora Hernandez needing her medicine. We are eating. People count on us, Jorge. [ pounding ] Just a minute. Good evening. I need some medicine for my son. Can you please help me? Of course, dear boy. Uh, give me one second, and I'll get the keys. Thank you. [ laughter ] The police are here. Let's go. Quickly. I'll handle the door. To the passageway. - No, Anacleto. No. - Hey, hey, hey. I'll be right behind you. - No, Anacleto. - Go. Go! Go! Go! It's very late. Can you please come back in the morning? I'm sorry? Open the door. Anacleto Gonzlez Flores? Or is it Don Jos? I am Anacleto. [ door slams open ] [ sighs ] We know exactly what peaceful work you're doing. We hope your friends learn from your mistakes. May God bless and forgive you, sir. I do. [ sobbing ] [ water running ] LALO: Jose? Yes? Do you ever wonder about God? Yes. I'm scared. Me, too. But Jesus is watching over us, Lalo. Since when did you become a priest? I'm no priest. [ sighs ] But I believe it. I know it. [ mocking ] I know it. [ chuckles ] Good night, Jose. Good night. [ groans ] Quin vive? Viva Cristo Rey. Get down. [ bird screeches ] [ overlapping chatter ] Stomach! Down! Hold the positions. [ laughter ] We want to see the general, sir. He's too busy to talk to you. Turn around and go home. We won't leave until we talk to the general. Go home, now! Teniente! Who wants to talk to me? These boys, sir. Go. Now. Go. Let's go! Rpido! Why are you here? We want to be Cristeros, mi General. And why do you want to be Cristeros? The padre of the church of Sahuayo... was killed... in front of me. He was teaching me to be an altar boy. Marta! Get these young men something to eat! S, mi General. Go. Gracias, mi General. MARTA: You must be hungry. Come on. [ footsteps ] Get up! War is no place for bums. [ rooster crows ] [ sighs ] Enjoy. General, can you teach me to shoot? It would not be right in the eyes of God to make you soldiers. We can fight. Yes, I know you could fight, but it'd be better for you to serve the cause by helping out around the camp. What I need is for you to show me that you're good workers and that you're disciplined. Like this? [ horse neighs ] FR. VEGA: May the body of Our Lord Jesus Christ preserve your soul unto everlasting life. May the body of Our Lord Jesus Christ preserve your soul unto everlasting life. May the body of Our Lord Jesus Christ preserve your soul unto everlasting life. Amen. You need to confess first. Wouldn't He already know? You should confess. May the body of Our Lord Jesus Christ preserve your soul unto everlasting life. Un honor conocerlo. Good to have you here. Thank you. Mmm. You like Mexican food? Well, don't get much of it in New Jersey, but this, just delicious. It's called mole poblano. It's made with chocolate. Chocolate. Hmm. One of Mxico's pre-Colombian gifts to the world. Oh, this is magnificent. Thank you. What are your impressions of Mxico? Well, I've traveled in Mexico numerous times, and, uh, you know, I'm always charmed. And it's--it's interesting, invariably I discover something that connects our two countries, chocolate and petroleum being two of them. American oil companies have been granted a 50-year concession that I consider very generous. Please sit. Well, I understand there are some in Washington who don't see it that way. We've been following your war with the Catholic Church. I would hardly call it a war. Terrible, what happened on the train. They were led by a priest. What does that tell you about their so-called moral superiority? Barbaric. But surely that doesn't represent the entire Catholic population. In my experience, it's small groups of extremists that start wars. In my experience as a revolutionary, a small group of determined men can bring down a government, and that is why every Catholic aggression must be responded to immediately, forcefully, and without hesitation. And if we continue talking politics, we're gonna ruin our digestions. Ambassador, salud. Salud. Bienvenido a Mxico. [ overlapping chatter ] Hey! - Victoriano. - Eh? Don't go through the canyon to Tlaquepaque. It's a trap. How do you know that? My scout was there yesterday. Let's just say it's a gut feeling. An ambush is what I would do if I was them. Let me ask you something, General. I'm just curious. If we die, if you lose this war-- We're not gonna lose this war. If you lose this war, do you still get paid all the money? Or do you get, like, half? I'm just curious. You want something from me, Flaco? [ spits ] If we die, we all die, but my family will be taken care of. That's very good for your family. We'll go through the canyon. Of course you will. [ spits ] Go with God, then. Hyah! Hyah! [ horses neigh ] [ men whistling ] Mi General, why did you let him disrespect you that way? VICTORIANO: Up in the rocks! They're up in the rocks! Take cover! Que viva Cristo Rey! Wait here! [ birds squawking ] Viva Cristo Rey. Que viva. Hyah. Muvanse, muchachos. Jose! Mi General. Chamaco's very happy to see you. He's very tired. I heard you saved Victoriano even though he said those things. A man like Victoriano, respect is won. Look at him. Come here. Look how beautiful he is. He's a Friesan. His name means "little child." He's a legendary war horse from northern Europe. In the Middle Ages, he would carry armored knights and kings into battle. His owner gave him to us specifically for our cause. He's the only one of its kind in all of Mxico. Go. Say hello. What's it like to ride him? You tell me. He'll need to be exercised tomorrow morning. But you have to be gentle on the reins. He has a very sensitive mouth. And he's very fast. He loves to run, so you have to hold on tight. Hey, Chamaco. Bello Chamaco. But what's it like to ride him? It's like being close to heaven. Jose. I've never had a son, but if I did, I would want him to be just like you. Que viva Cristo Rey. Que viva! Bueno. [ continues in Spanish ] ...meijor fortificacin. Pero cunta gente tenemos en esta rea? Aqu en esta rea, tenemos unas dos mil tropas-- Seor Presidente. Mi General Ortiz and almost 500 men are dead. Ortiz? That's impossible. Who told you that? A counterambush, sir. Cristeros hired Enrique Gorostieta as commander of all the Cristero forces. General Gorostieta is behind this? He fought with Huerta, sir. I know. I know that. What I don't know is how could someone like Ortiz be so incompetent? Gorostieta. His treason will not be forgotten nor forgiven. Do you understand? Go to Los Altos immediately. Bring all the men you can. Yes, Mr. President. Go. Go! [ raps table ] Gorostieta is back in politics? Yes, sir. But I know him. His heart is not in this. Find out what he really wants. What he-- Porfirio Daz used to say, "A dog with a bone in his mouth doesn't bark and doesn't bite." In politics, everything has a price. Go find his. How was the ride? Like flying, sir. Come here. Tomorrow morning, I'm going to lead the men into battle. Want to carry the flag? It would be an honor, sir. We leave at first light. Today we are gonna send a message. We are gonna send a message to Calles and to the rest of the world... that freedom is not just for writers and for politicians and-- and for fancy documents! Freedom-- Freedom is our home, our wives, our children, our faith. Freedom is our lives... and we will defend it or die trying! It is not only our duty to defend it, but it is our right! You must remember that men will fire bullets, but God decides where they land! Que viva Cristo Rey! Que viva! - Que viva Cristo Rey! - Que viva! - Que viva! - Que viva! GOROSTIETA: My dearest Tulita... today was a magnificent day, and not simply because we routed the federales in our greatest victory yet. There is a change in the spirit of my men, a transformation I can see in their eyes. They finally believe we can win this war. I know the federales can sense this, too. The scent of fear now blows from their camps. We must strike them harder now, push them back so the people will be emboldened to support us in the cities. Then Calles and his army will have nowhere to hide. My strategy cannot fail us, and I will be home before long. Keep me close in your heart, my love, and I will see you again tonight in my dreams. This--This war has Americans and other foreigners reluctant to do business or even visit, and I wonder if... you can see your way to some kind of compromise. No. But if your country and my country would strengthen their ties... this could end very quickly. That's not what I had in mind. Actual military support is-- of course, is out of the question, but I think a provision could be made for the sale of American machine guns and aircraft. When can I get the planes? Well, Mr. President, first we need the gesture of goodwill. Now, I think a different position on American petroleum interests would go a long way. I will bring your generous offer to Congress. [ overlapping chatter ] Forward! [ groans ] [ coughs ] Mi General, here's my horse. [ gasping ] Hey. Hey, what are you doing? Come here. Come on. Get on the horse. You'll be faster alone, mi General. What are you doing? Get on the horse. Sorry, mi General. Get on the hor-- Jose! They're gonna kill you! Get on the horse! I'll be fine, mi General. [ shouting ] Stay low, Jose! I'll come back for you! - Take cover! - Do it! Viva Cristo Rey. Que viva. Jose! GOROSTIETA: You took his horse? You took a boy's horse? He refused to get on. It was either him or me. Is he dead? I don't know. I looked for him myself. He wasn't among the dead. I think he either escaped to the forest or he was captured. Send two men. Search for him. I already sent men to the forest. He'll be all right. He's braver than most men. This is true. Leave me alone. Get my horse ready. [ exhaling sharply ] Oh, God. Victoriano. [ sniffles ] That is my boy. We let him down. He inspires me, and we let him down. This is, um-- Here. I found that... where I left him. That was his. Jose! Jose! Jose! [ echoes ] Jose! Jose! [ overlapping chatter ] GOROSTIETA: Thank you. FR. VEGA: How are you? Not good. A scout tells us that General Rodriguez is heading towards Tepatitln to set up headquarters. This will be one of the most important battles of our struggle. I'm entrusting it to you... with Pedroza and Victoriano under your command. I'm ready, Commander. You, Pedroza and Victoriano will be in Tepatitln in two days. We can pull some more troops in. If you get there first, it will not be necessary. You go into the city. You look for vantage points-- buildings, rooftops, behind walls, sheltered places. There will be not one Cristero in sight. [ spits ] Padre, can't you see the gun? We have to attack now. Hyah! What the hell is he doing? Fuego! CRISTERO: Catorce! Did we get the-- Did we get the machine gun? Yes. - Yes. - [ gurgles ] Yes. Yes. Okay. Viva Cristo Rey. Que viva. [ gunfire, yelling continue ] [ sighs ] In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sanctus. Well done, Victoriano. Ah, Lalo. - Lalo, are you a strong rider? - Yes, sir. I want you to ride like the wind to Sahuayo. Find out if Jose is there. You report back to me as soon as possible. Yes, sir. You're only alive because the capitn knows your padrino. [ scoffing laugh ] BOY: Are they going to kill us? I don't want to die. I'm scared, too, Lorenzo. This is what happens when you don't tell me what I need to know. - Pull. - [ gasps ] [ car approaching ] No! No! Muvete. Get out! I'm gonna take you home, Jose. I'm gonna take you home. Just--Just say the words. "Death to Cristo Rey. Long live the federal government." No, Padrino. [ stammers ] They're just words. I--I can't, Padrino. Just f-for your mother. Viva Cristo Rey. [ car driving away ] Your luck has run out. [ train whistle blows ] - Bishop Diaz? - Yes. - Bishop Ruiz? - Yes. Dwight Morrow. What a pleasure. The pleasure is ours, Mr. Ambassador. Would you care for some tea? Please join us. Oh, superb, superb. The prospects of the trip have improved already. Mr. Ambassador... who actually invited us? It's important to everyone. And I've been working with President Calles to try and find a solution to this madness. We are ready to listen and to bring the message to Rome. Well, I know Rome and the top prelates have not publicly claimed support for the Cristeros, but neither have they disowned them. And in this situation, their silence is deafening. This whole thing has been-- It's been an unnecessary tragedy. And Calles himself sees that now, and he's ready to find a compromise with the Church. What is critical is that we reach an agreement soon so that the killings stop and services can begin again in peace, and with peace comes stability and prosperity. Peace and stability, Mr. Ambassador? Gentlemen, would you excuse me for a moment? Of course. [ sighs ] Jose. Lalo. The general sent me to see if you were here. You have to go. La Guada could see you. Hold on. I'm in God's hands, Lalo. [ clatter ] Go. Before they see you. A complete pardon for the entire Cristero army? What should we do with their leadership? Give them a parade with confetti all the way up to Chapultepec Castle? Well, the pardon must be universal, specifically including the leadership, or there won't be an accord. How many men did you lose with General Rodriguez in Tepatitln? Just how many more are you prepared to lose? And Rome? Will it accept the other terms? I believe I can arrange a meeting with the bishops to confirm their support. [ sighs ] Before I give you my answer, there is something I need to do first. What's that? Go see an old friend. [ birds squawking ] Frankly, I thought you would not come. You came to me. This is Cristero country. This is Mxico, Enrique. Please join me. How's the family? Your wife, Tulita? She's very excited. Church bells will be ringing freely very soon. Salud. Viva Cristo Rey. Your war is coming to an end very soon. You're here to concede? [ chuckles ] Not quite, no. It's not my war. It's your war. You declared war on freedom. I know you for a long time, and I know you're not a fool, so you must know this war is not about freedom, and it's not about religion. It's about who is going to decide the fate of Mxico and its people. Well, the people of Mxico have spoken. They did speak when they elected me President, not you. I run things in this country. Not for long. An agreement is being discussed. Mxico and Rome are going to make peace. An agreement? No one wants this war anymore, Enrique. Mxico is bleeding on its own fields. Mxico is hanging from telegraph poles from Monterrey to Veracruz. Of course you need an agreement. But freedom has no compromise. By definition, it is absolute, and that's why we will be victorious. Keep your agreement. Please spare me your rhetorical idealism and tell me, what do you really want? Absolute freedom. Is that in the agreement? The agreement is all but sealed. This is yours, your agreement. It's not ours. You're holding your fate in your hands. The fate of Mxico, the destiny of Mxico... it's in God's hands, not yours or mine. Que viva Cristo Rey. The American Ambassador Morrow has made a preliminary agreement between the government of Mxico and Rome. An agreement? What kind of an agreement? The Church has been asked to forgo half of its demands. In return, the government will loosen some restrictions on the clergy. What does that mean exactly? The extreme laws will be rescinded. Others will be... officially unenforced. And then what? With Rome's blessing, the church bells could be ringing again within a month. My brother died for this. For what? Mi General, what should we do? We will defeat this government, we will overthrow Calles, and we will establish a democratic government that respects the rights of the people! Especially the basic right to worship God in peace. And with God on our side, we will prevail. [ kiss ] I wish I had your faith. Jose's faith. I don't know where to find it. If your heart's open, it might find you. Entre el cielo y la tierra  Entre la luz...  In a few seconds, you're gonna beg me to let you spit on Cristo Rey. [ sobbing ] Jess nos da fuerzas! Do you have anything to tell me? Viva Cristo Rey! [ distant ] Viva Cristo Rey! Viva Cristo Rey! ...y slo mi corazn  And what about going through Colotln to get to get to Tlaltenango? No, better through Aguascalientes. It's safer. General! They have Jose. They're going to kill him. - In Sahuayo? - Yes, sir. Teniente, you plus 1 0 men come with me! - The rest, return to camp! - S, mi General. Desmonte. Vaya. con el General. El resto se regresa al campamento. Ya! Ho! Hah! Entre el cielo y la tierra  Entre la luz y la oscuridad  Entre la fe y el pecado  Slo se encuentra mi corazn  Est Dios y slo mi corazn  [ thunder rumbling ] Just say the words. You can go home. I love you. [ thunder crashes ] Viva Cristo Rey. [ stabs ] [ gasping ] I'm going home. [ gunshot ] [ woman crying ] [ Gorostieta sniffles ] [ crying out ] [ insects chirping ] GOROSTIETA: Why couldn't I save him? You tried. What kind of God would allow that to happen? God allows us the freedom to choose. Some choose to be evil. But God can take even the most horrific events and use them for good. Like the cross. Maybe Jose wasn't supposed to be saved. How could you even say that? He--He was just a little boy. He had a whole life in front of him. Even as a boy... he was a martyr. We never know what God has in mind. What God has in mind? What does He have in mind? That Rome should turn its back on us... and all the people that have given their lives for Him? That's what He has in mind? Who are you gonna obey? Rome or me? I am a priest first, mi comandante. You can still be a priest, after everything you've done? I will always be a priest. And I will pray every day... for our merciful God to forgive me. What about me? Will you pray for me? Will you pray for what I've done? Better pray hard. Check. I resign. I'm tired. I miss my wife Tulita and the girls. This young man died for us! Viva Cristo Rey. [ panting ] Vega! [ snaps fingers ] How many? I don't know. [ whistles ] [ clicks tongue ] I want to confess. - Now? - Now. We need to make a run for the horses, get to a safe position. Let's go around the back. Are you a priest first, or aren't you? Didn't you say not to worry about those who can kill the body, but those who can kill the soul? It was something like that. So... you were listening. Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Padre, this is between you and me. [ chuckles ] And Him. [ Cristeros yelling ] They're everywhere! - They're all on the roof. - Come on. Not for long. Bullets. How are you feeling? Viva Cristo Rey. CRISTERO: Viva Cristo Rey! Follow me. [ men yelling, gunfire ] Disparen! Ready? Load up. Padre, can you confess yourself? No. Then I will try. Padre Vega is a good man. He served You well, as well as he could, and that's all anyone can ask of us, so forgive him... and have mercy on us both. Amen. [ grunts ] Padre! Okay, stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. Teniente! Gather the horses. I want the men and Padre Vega out of here immediately. Okay, talk to me. [ sighs ] Stay with me. T alk to me. Your confession... [ chuckles ] You make a better general than a priest. Mi General. Okay, here we go. Teniente, what they want is me. Get the men back to El Lucero. And get Padre Vega to a doctor... - and a real priest. - Mi General-- Do as I say. Padre, que viva-- Padre! Padre! Que viva Cristo Rey! Que viva. Que viva! [ gunfire continues ] Cristeros! [ whoops ] CRISTERO: Viva Cristo Rey! Fuego directo! [ neighs ] We never know what God has in mind. You cannot fight for something you don't believe in. I believe in religious freedom, and I believe in you. God allows us the freedom to choose. TULITA: I believe in what you would be fighting for. Maybe by doing it, you will, too. God can take even the most horrific events and use them for good. GOROSTIETA: Viva Cristo Rey. Que viva. Entre el cielo y la tierra  Entre la luz y la oscuridad  Entre la fe y el pecado  Slo se encuentra mi corazn  Est Dios y slo mi corazn  Dios y slo mi corazn
