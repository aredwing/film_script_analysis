It's $ 180 for the windshield. $ 180, $260... everything. Okay. - Do you do bodywork, too? - Yeah. Maybe a little bit of bodywork on the other side of the car. What about inspections? Nah, I don't do inspections. Hey, put it over there. Go get the tools. Put it on for me. Wants the windshield, too? What? No, don't worry about the windshield. Ale, here's a key. Make sure you lock everything up good, all right? Come on, Ringo. Come on. Good boy, come on, inside. That's it. Stay out of my office. I got a lot of shit I don't want nobody touching in there, okay? Go to Stella's, get yourself something to eat before 10:00, all right? Ale, put that shit in the Dumpster, too. M m-hmm. Is Isamar there? This is Alejandro. Is this Lilah? When is she getting back? I want to leave a message. Shorty, stay on your side, shorty. Yo, yo. You're leading too much, shorty. You got to stay over there, man. Oh, what's up? How you doing? How you been? Fine. - You sure? - Yeah. You've gotten skinnier. What's going on with you? Nothing. I called all the safe homes, and you weren't there. I'm not staying in the safe homes. I'm never going back there. - Why not? - Because I'm not. I was staying at Lilah's. Yo, what's with all these questions? You still following Lilah and believing her bullshit? It's not bullshit. Her aunt is really waiting for us in Florida. We're gonna go to those private schools. We just don't got money right now. Yeah, sure you're going to Florida. Like our uncle was to call us, what, a year ago? And that fake chain around your neck. Did Lilah get you that, too? It ain't fake. I used to sell that stuff on 37 th Ave. Ale, you worked there for a week. A week is long enough to know that them sneakers is fake as hell. M y sneakers are not fake. They're official. So let me see them. Ale, they're... Ale, stop. Ale. Ale. Yo, you finally got us a place, huh? Yeah, and I got you a job, too. Laura's mad cool. She cooks rice, beans, flautas, and, you know, everything else. And you don't got to worry about it 'cause you know how to do that stuff, too. Ale, we're staying here? No, straight upstairs. Come on. Come on. Now, you better not quit this job like you did the last job. All right, the last job was wack, and it was boring. So what? - This is it. - It's small. It ain't small. It's mad big. Look, there's a bed, a microwave, and a fridge. Look. Look. Well... Country Club. All grape. You want one right now? No, I'm good. Thank you. This is all the stuff you brung? - This is the owner? - Yeah, that's Rob. - He knows I'm here, right? - Of course. - Ale. - I'm serious. I just finished talking to him like four hours ago. Yo, this door locks? Why do we need a lock on this if there's a giant lock outside? Come over here. I need to show you something. There's a bathroom downstairs. Own bathroom. - Our own bathroom? - Yep. - It got a shower? - Yep. - Where's it at? - Downstairs. Where, Ale? - To the left. - M y left? Where? No, to the right, to the right, to the right.

It's only the first day. Things are gonna start getting better. Ale, all she does is complain and bitch at me all the time. Come on, now. She ain't all that bad. I'm gonna work this shit out. Don't worry about it. What you gonna work out? I got us this place to stay at Rob's for free. I could fix this, too. - Man, whatever. - I'm serious. I'm gonna work this shit out. Don't worry about it. Yo, where you going with that thing? I'm going to Joe's. Come, you can give me a hand. - Hey, is this that tire? - Yeah. Come on, let's go. I'm checking. - Who's Ale? - Me. Here's your money. Nice. Strike two. That's strike two? Oh. Come on, same time, same time. That shit is heavy. Let me try to knock it down. Hold up. Wait for this. Hold up. Let me hit it once. Ah, you suck. Yo, that shit's heavy. So, where were you? I woke you up, Ale? I'm sorry. You were probably out with Lilah. Why you always think that I'm with Lilah? So, where were you, then? I was out shopping. Look what I bought. If you like it made by blind people, yeah. Then I guess you don't want what I bought you. - Quit playing. - No. Quit playing. You dis my shirt, you're not getting it. It's probably ugly anyway. You're so stubborn. So, do you like it? It's better than yours. It's better than mine? I got it in the same spot. M ine fits better, anyway. Oh, please. You know it doesn't. M ine looks better. Whatever. Get out my bed. I got to go brush my teeth, anyways. Good, your breath stinks. Your breath stinks, too. Come on, hurry up. We have a lot of things to do. Put it in there. Please go and get two more, okay? Go on, get two more. Come on, come on. Come on, sweetie, hurry up, hurry up. We have a lot of things to do. We're running late. Come on. The axle's busted, but I'm getting Carlos' uncle to fix it. Everything else is good. So, how's the van? It's pretty good, right? $4, 500. We don't got that type of money. I already lowered it from $6, 000. Come see the inside. No, I told her I'd be back in an hour. How are you gonna leave without seeing the inside? Come on. Look, there's gonna be a cabinet right here, all the silverware right here. Throw some metal over that, it's gonna be sparkling. It's great, right? - This van is beat up. - Not at all. All we need is a new alternator. Then, everything else... simple bodywork. I could fix that by myself. Yo, Ale, I just talked to my uncle. He says he can fix the axle. See? Things are already getting better. I mean, what do we know about running a van? What does Laura know? If we can buy this, Laura ain't gonna be your boss no more. Yo, I'm gonna come back with the money. Just hold this for me, all right? Bye, Uncle. Hey, he wants a glass. - You want a glass? - Mirror. This mirror? - I got it. - Nah, get out of here. What do you need? - Yeah, I need this and... - Rob! Okay, I got it right here. Yo, come on, bring it in. Hey, Carlos, these are your pigeons? Yep. Where do they come from? They come from... See the bus over there? So, every morning when I come, when they see me, they know me. So they follow me to open my shop. Really? No, they don't. Really. Look. If you want, I could catch one for you now. Look. They're my friends. They like me. I fail. You can try sometime. Ale. Here's your pay. I'll see you in the morning. Ringo, come on. Come on, let's go. What are you counting it for? Whoo-whoo! That was bad. - Get off the phone. - Ale, stop. Get off the... Get it out, get it out. You're gonna make me spill it. Stop. I'm gonna call you later, okay? All right, bye. Ahmad. - You done? - Yeah. Aw, you got to be... Yo, Carlos. You think we got enough feet? Yeah. Aah! If we do get it, it's gonna go "Isi's Van" and then be red. How are you putting your name and picking the color? Because I'm older than you, I'm cooking, and I'm driving that van. All right, I'm sanding, I'm priming, I'm painting, and doing the letters. But my name's going on that van. All right, all right. It's going like this. M y name is going diagonally. Your initials can maybe go, like, right here. - I nitials? - Yeah. All right, all right, "Isi. " That's it. Nah, it's gonna go "Isi's Van," your name on the bottom, just "Ale" for short. No, no, no, I want my whole name. All right, little, your whole name, and it's gonna be red. - Little? - Yeah. Why your name got to be so big? Because it's gonna be my van. Guys like girls' names anyways. All right, this is how it's gonna go. M y name goes on the van, and you pick the color, and I hold the money because you don't know how to count. What are you talking about? You never even finished school. At least I finished 10th grade. You didn't go to school. So what? I still know how to count. And you got to promise to not eat all the food and save some for the customers, 'cause your love handles are getting too big by the minute. Shut up. You know what? - Name five cereals. - I don't know no cereals. I don't know no cereals, please. I don't know no cereals. You name five cereals. Ah, you name five cereals. You name them. Name... Name... Name them. Name... Aah! No, no, no, stop it! Yo, Ale! Hurry up! The game's gonna start. - You want to come? - No. - You mind if I go? - Go ahead, go. Yo, Ale! Here. What's this for? It's money for the van if you're serious. I'll put this in my stash tomorrow. You sure you don't want to come? No. Go have fun. Look, there's somebody warming up in the bullpen. Yeah. It's a better view from up here than over there. Yeah. Yo, I still think second base is more important. Nah, I don't think. I think shortstop is. You know why? Because if they get, like, if the ball hits to them, they make the double play. What happened? What happened? Come on. I saw that. I saw that. Nah, you missed. Yo, let's go to the truck stop and see some whores. Yeah, come on. Come on, hurry up. A whore just got into the truck. You see? Yeah. I wonder what's going on in there. That guy's getting lucky. Yeah, he's probably sucking on some tits right now. Oh, please, she's the one doing the sucking. Come on, you ain't never even had a blow job before. Yeah, I did. No, you didn't. You're a lying-ass bitch. Look, you ain't even hard right now, look at you. Hands off of me, fag. Yo, come on. I'll pay for you. Nah. "Nah"? Come on. What, you scared now? You being a little pussy now? You don't even know how much it costs. Yes, I do. $40 for a blow job, $80 for a fuck. Come on. How do you know all this stuff? Word gets around. Come on. You don't want to get your dick sucked now? Come on. Look, there she is, there she is. Ale, wait. Ale, wait up. Ale, wait. Ale, hold up. Yo, come on, let's go beat that guy up. I got a pipe in my shop. We could smash his windows. Come on, man. We could just kill the guy. Man, it was too dark. No way that was your sister. Yo, shut the fuck up! What the fuck, man? Yo, get up. I barely touched you. - Fuck you, man. - Fuck you! You think I don't know about that shit? Yo, from now on, mind your fucking business, all right? Yo, Ale, hold up. Come on, man. Rob, you scared me. You scared me, too, Isi. What are you doing? Trying to get these clothes to dry. I left some papers here. - Why don't you use the heater? - You sure? Yeah, I told you kids to use whatever you want. Let me plug it in for you and see. - Is it good? - Yeah, it works good. Just make sure you unplug it so you don't burn down, all right? - All right. - See you later. Thanks. Ale, what are you doing here? You're soaking wet. - Here. - What's this? That's for tips, if you need the extra money. Put it right there. All right, thanks. What's up, man? What you got here? So, did you fix my axle? I got an ice-cream truck there, and you don't want it. Why every time I come here, you ask me for the ice-cream truck? Save you a problem. It's good. No. Do you want one or not? Yes, I'm gonna take this one for my wife. She likes that movie. How much is it? $5, but I'll give you 2 for $8. No, I got no time for that. Here. Don't forget to fix my axle. Don't worry about it. I'll see you later. Ale, come on, get up. Ale, wake up. Yo, Ale. Ale, where you going? Yo, Ale, what's wrong? Look for a '96 fender. - Yo, Ahmad. - What's up? They're not stolen, are they? Look at them. Tell me if you want them. - I'll give you $25. - Why $25? Because that's a set and that's not. Make it $30. Kid, you want it or not? Take it or leave it. Which one... Go right there? Yeah, come on. - Yo, these sneakers is hot. - I know. You're gonna wear them every day, right? Hell, yeah. Yo, what do you think about this place? It's all right. It's all right? They got the best burritos. Lilah. What is she doing here? I don't know. I'm gonna find out. What's up? # It's not, it's not, it's not my fault # What's going on? Me and Lilah's gonna go chill for a little bit, okay? Where are you going? I'm going to Woodside. I'm just gonna hang out. - But for what? - To chill. Chill with who? With a couple of friends, all right? A couple of friends? And what about dinner? Dinner's good. Just take it to the place, and I'll eat it there. Oh, thanks for the sneakers. # No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no # # It's not my fault # # It's not my fault # # That that man loves me # # And gave his entire life # # If you didn't know how to love him # # If you didn't know how to adore him, what a shame # # What grief you give me # Nothing! You ain't nothing! Yo, back up, man. Don't fight out here. It's hot. It is hot. Ale. Come here, listen up. You got to go to bed early tonight 'cause we're gonna prime that car in the morning. Can I paint it? First you got to learn how to prime before you can paint. Here. See you in the morning. What did I tell you? Don't do that in front of me again, you hear me? - Good night. - Good night. Yo! Look. Do you want? How much? Look. Do you want? No, no, no. Whatever you want. All right, for this. I'll give you five pesos anyway. Give me. Give me. When are you coming around again? Yo! Is that your truck? What the fuck are you doing over there? Is that your truck? Yes or no? What? Are you jerking off over there? Tell me if that's your truck. No, it's not my fucking truck, man. What the fuck are you asking me so many questions? What? You want a blow job? 'Cause if you want, you got to get it yourself. She's no joke. If she's sucking your dick, how good can she be? - What are you doing tonight? - Nothing. I got some guys coming over. We're gonna hang out. Why don't you come by and give me a hand? How much you paying? Serious. How are you, man? Great to see you. You like this? It's nice, man, really, really nice.

Hey, hey, whoa, come on. - Why you talking shit? - Hey! Hey, hey! Let me tell you something, man. Get the fuck away from me, man. Ale. What are you still doing up? I need to know who was upstairs today. Why? 'Cause I'm missing money, and I just need to know. - What money? - M y money. - Well, did you look carefully? - Yeah. - You sure? - I'm positive. I searched everywhere. The person that comes in mind to me is Lilah. Again with Lilah? She was the only one in the room. Look, I counted my money yesterday. Lilah hasn't been here since last week. Who else was here? Well, Billy and Tony are always up and down. Billy and Tony? But I don't understand why you would leave your money there anyway. Ale, I'm living here. I got to keep my stuff here, too. - Well, how much was it? - I don't know. You just told me that you counted it yesterday. Look, I'm really upset right now. I don't remember. So, what you want me to do? Nothing. Look, the van is coming. Don't worry about it. We gonna make a lot of money. Sure. You gonna make your specials. You know, they're getting pretty good. Okay. So, who's locking up? Me or you? Oh, me. You sure? Yeah. - You sure you know how to do it? - I'm positive. Man, we're gonna have to, like, scrub that shit down. I can't wait to start driving it. I'm gonna go like this. Yeah, we need to fix the wheel, too. Move over to the side a little bit. Watch. And it's not going no blue. Yes, it is. It might be going... So, no, 'cause we got to change this. I don't want the... All right, the whole van is white, and then the tabs like this, red. No. Yeah, like the window, that, probably this is red. Yeah, initials right here. - Ale, let me see the paperwork. - For what? Just let me see the paperwork. Did you guys look inside? Yeah, it's a little beat up, but it's all right. A little beat up? You already know what specials you're gonna make, right? Number one is empanadas. I knew that was the first one coming. Ale, are you stupid or something? What? Look inside this place, man. All this stuff has got to pass health code. They don't do health code around here. They don't even care about it. Ale, man, look at this grill. Okay, it's got rust on it. Of course it does, man. - So what? - It does. It says it right here. Did you even read this? Look. Who signed that? Did you sign it? I did. Did you read this? It doesn't matter. Ale, it matters. You're gonna be serving food out of this kitchen. And, look, there's no vents here. There's holes everywhere. It's rusted everywhere. Come on, stop exaggerating. We could clean that off. Come on, Ale, man. With some bodywork and everything and a paint job, yeah, it's gonna look fine on the outside. But I could fix it. That's what I was trying to tell you. But it's the inside. It's the kitchen equipment. You're gonna spend $ 10, 000 to fix that. - Now you lying. - Are you serious? $ 10, 000? He's lying. Don't believe him. What are you talking about? I used to have one of these. This is used equipment. You can't fix those things. You got to buy new ones, man. Yo, what are we gonna do now, Ale? He don't know nothing about our van. "Don't believe him," I said. Ale, how much you pay for this? How much you pay for this? $4, 500. $4, 500? Are you kidding me? No, we're serious. Yo, let's bring it back to Carlos' uncle right now. It's too late. You guys signed the papers. He's playing us. Ale, where you going? Ale. Hey, Carlos. What up, Ale? Whoa, whoa, what's going on? What's wrong with you, Ale? - What is wrong with you, man? - You were lying! Come on, get off. Yo, kid, what are you doing? Relax, relax. You lied! You lied about them. You made me go to your uncle. You cheated me. Your uncle took the papers, right? Yo, what are you doing? I swear to God, I don't know what he's talking about. I swear to God. If I find out you cheated me, I'm gonna fuck you up. What the hell is going on? All right, big guy. You can wait until you have enough money to fix this, you can hope that some dumb ass will come by and maybe he'll buy it, but you can't leave it here. Or I'll give you $ 1, 000, chop it up for parts, and that's it. You don't have to worry about anything. It'll be done. What do you want to do? This thing's got to get out of here. I got a lot of things going on. You know that. Let me know what you want to do, okay? This thing's got to be out by tomorrow. Ale. Ale, what's this shit I hear about you ending up with this van? Can I have my pay? No, you can't have your fucking pay. What's the matter with you? Listen, kid. Listen to me. What's going on with you these days? You got to straighten this shit out.
