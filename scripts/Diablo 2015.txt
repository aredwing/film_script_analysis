Jackson! Jackson. There he is, Dad. He's alive. Get him up. Get him up! Where is Alexsandra? Jackson, where is your wife? She's been taken. Kidnapped. Bring me all the bullets you can. It'll be light soon. Brought every rifle bullet we could find. Thank you, Timothy. You know where they headed? Down the south trail, towards New Mexico. They spoke Spanish. If I'm right, I've got a friend down that way. He can help me out. I made this map myself 15 years ago. Now, there'll be new routes up there, they'll turn you around. But you watch the mountains, and they'll be your guide. You be careful. I haven't met your new bride yet. And I don't know what kinda mess you got yourself into with these Mexicans, but you seem like a fine man. I wish you the best in getting her back. Yeah. That's a good boy. Where is she? You will get what you deserve. You will get yours. Hmm? Where is she? She's gone. And you'll die. You are the damned. Hear that, Ace? How do you like that? Ah! What are you doing? That wasn't very nice! Excuse me. Sir! Sir. Look, I'm in a hurry. I'm no thief. My wife. She was taken. Down the south trail. By Mexicans. I need to get her back. I see a rider. Three men, one woman. Ah-ah-ah! Money. Two. Five. No wife. What? No talk... no wife. Go now, or I shoot. Ah! Well, sometimes, I just can't help myself. Huh. Hello, sir. Pleased to make your acquaintance. Just to keep you informed... this is my road, and as such, I collect a toll from all travelers for safe passage. What kind of toll? Everything you got. Maybe even your soul. - Your horse looks real nice. - The horse stays. Well, that is not your decision to make. You're on my road! And you will pay my price. And my price includes that horse. Are you lookin' to die? You look like you wanna die. You like killing unarmed men, don't you? I just like killin' men. Especially when their conversation bores me so. Do I know you? You look awful familiar to me. Yes. I think I do know you. Yes, I do. We look tough, we act tough, but in the end, we're just lonely, scared men. Well, I know a soldier when I see one. You looking for a way to forget the war? Forget all the horrible, horrible things you did. Shut up right now. Oh, I like that. You know, I'd like to know more about you. How does it make you feel... when I do that? Answer me, goddammit! Open up. You scared? Well, don't be scared. Sometimes I think about doing it two, three times a day. Ah! That's my answer. I'm gonna kill you for that. Ah! Ah! Yeah, easy, boy. Easy, boy. Ah! He's going for his gun! Let's go! Let's go! Oh, Ace. Oh, Ace. Ah... Oh, no... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, pal. Good boy. Only one thing I enjoy more than killing a man. Watching a man die all by himself. Death might be a favor to you. How you doing, friend? You still with us? What's that? Fuck you. Well, I don't know if I can honor your dying wish, which really is sad for me. Just... just kill me. No, no, no, no, not so fast. Why, this is the best moment. Now, we don't want to rush this. Just leave... leave me alone. You know what I find most sad about you? You are all alone... in a world that don't celebrate being alone. Be thankful my son dragged you here behind his horse. There are stories of a killer on the trail. He awakens. Look at him. He awakens and does not know where he is. Where are my guns? This one wants to steal a horse. You brought an evil white man into our camp. This diseased filth needs to go. At the last village they told a story about a killer out there killing men and taking women. You saw him. He was possessed by evil spirits! Seven winters... Seven women. Father, it is my duty to honor my commitment to save his life. Go on, son. I tried to force him into cold waters with my bow. When his gun overcame me he spared my life. Your foolishness has brought a great burden. We will find out what kind of man you have brought amongst us. Bring him to the sweat lodge. Let us see how the white man likes our peyote. What'd you... what'd you do? You've got to kill yourself to end this, Jackson. You need to end your own life, Jackson. - No. - You were supposed to look out for me. You know, that's what older brothers do. No. It's time to die. No. Why'd you shoot me, Jackson? Your own brother, Jackson. No! I didn't mean... I didn't mean to kill... I didn't mean to... No! This one must go now. This man is your responsibility. You have honored your debt to him. Give him your horse so he leaves and never comes back. Thank you. May you find your way. Wait. No. For... for you. Hey! Hey! Ah! Crazy man! Go now! Crazy man. Go. Go now! Crazy man! Go now! Ah! Ah! Mr. Carver? It's Jackson. You remember me? Yes, sir... I know who you are. Who could forget? Ah, this is my granddaughter. This is my acquaintance, Jackson. - Hello. - Pleased to meet you. We served in the war together. Rebecca lives with me now. How long's it been, huh? Hmm. Seven years in May. Yeah. Yeah, that's about right. I didn't know you had a family. You look like you had a really rough journey. What brings you to my door? My wife. She's... She's been kidnapped. She's taken. Taken from me. Wife? I'm so sorry to hear that. Anything I can do to get you back on the trail? I could use a proper saddle. My horse. Certainly. I have a small shed. It's yours. Now, whatever you need. Keep the saddle. Thank you. I'll meet you over there. Grandfather, what's wrong? He's killed more men than you met in your lifetime. You load your gun like I showed you, and if anything happens to me, Rebecca, you will run from here. Do you hear me? Do as I tell you. You will run from this man and you do not look back. Run for your life. Grandpa! You run... if anything happens to me. Uh, you have any... water for my horse? Pond water's not the best water. Follow me, son. Let's walk down to the creek. So you're headed south, huh? - Yeah, that's right. - Hmm. Saw a group of riders, uh... passing the big trail yesterday. You know, three riders and one woman. Mexican. What time of day yesterday? Late. But the sun was still not down. Huh. Those Mexicans you... you saw, they... they took my wife. They came in the night and they took her. Those are awful things for any man to have to say. My concern is that those riders seemed peaceful enough. But they had the fear of God in their... eyes. Look, I'm... I'm sorry to bring stories of bloodshed and kidnapping to your door. Those things had to be said. Those men... Those men are the worst of their kind. Why does it strike me that the last time I saw you... after some of the things you did for General Sherman, the men... they called you Diablo? I asked the men what it meant. And when they told me... I learned something about you. No. No, I was just following orders. I'm a married man intent on landing my family. You were eventually... Sherman's best killer, and as I recall, you came to enjoy life on his trail. Jackson... I have a granddaughter in my life here. I was always kind to you, wasn't I? Yes. I don't mince my words. Why did you come here? I came to ask for your help. After all these years, you're still torturing yourself over... accidentally shooting your brother? Go home, son. Leave those people alone. Oh, I understand. I fear you haven't been well since last I seen you. Once you fetch the water from that stream, we'll get you a proper meal. Then you have to go. Alright? Please! You can have anything you want, but please don't hurt us. You gonna look at me like that? All I needed was a little bit of fucking help from you. That's all I needed. Ah, there he is! Our intrepid trail traveler. I just can't seem to lose you. Well, what can I say? - I've become attached. - Jackson... stop this insanity right now. Yeah, your fight's with me. My fight is with everybody. Lovely granddaughter he has in there. - No. - Benjamin, how old is she? Please, just leave my granddaughter alone. Please. Shhh. Shhh-shhh. Please, Jackson. I mean you no harm. I can help you. Yeah, I... I will go with you... and bring your wife back. You had your chance. Now say your prayers. Say 'em! For if we live... we live to the Lord. Louder. If we die... we die to the Lord. - Louder, goddammit! I want to hear it! - Whether we live or we die... we are to the Lord! Our Father, who art in Heaven... - Louder! - Hallowed be thy name!... - Louder! - Thy Kingdom come, thy... - Louder, goddammit! - Give us this day our daily bread... You should've never questioned me. - And forgive us our trespasses as... - You better hope he's listening. - Where is Csar? - I want to leave. Over there. Let's go, Csar! Relax, Guillermo, we are almost to the house! No! No. - Guillermo! - Stay! - Guillermo! - Alexsandra! - Ah! - Don't be afraid! Let's go! Guillermo! Csar! No! No! No! He will kill us all. Let's go! We have to get her to safety! Listen! Listen! Get the children! Get into the house! Fast! Fast! Fast! Alexsandra! Where is she? Bring her to me! Or I'll kill every last one of you. Ah! Ah! Mama! Ah! My sister will never be with you. That might just be a favor to you. Take it. Hmm. Yes, sir. We don't wanna rush this... do we? Here he comes! Here he comes! You go that way. There he is. Ah! Alexsandra. Alexsandra! Alexsandra! Why have you done this? Guillermo's my husband. Come out and face me! Come out now! What you wanted was a fantasy. How many other women have you done this to? Alexsandra! You left me no choice. I... I had to have you. If you touch her I will kill you! You poor man. No! No! Alexsandra! I am going to kill you! I am going to kill you! Get out of my house. Go! Go! No! No! No, please! No, don't! No! Stop! Stop it! No! Please, he's the father of my children! - Please don't! Guillermo! - Alexsandra. I am not afraid. I am not afraid. Don't do it. We can stop. There does not need to be any more death. No! No!
