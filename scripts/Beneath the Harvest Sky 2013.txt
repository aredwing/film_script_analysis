I like to go in slow and deep, you know? You know what I'm talking about there? Does that embarrass you there? Oh, yeah. Ha, ha, ha, he is. Look at you, you're fuckin' embarrassed. Are you blushing? It's the way you say it. You're blushing. Holy shit. Oh, yeah. Next one. One hand. One hand? If you got to use two, I'd fuckin' shoot you. What's the... the next one? 250, 250. That's fuckin' you right there. Oh, yeah. All fuckin' day. Oh, yeah. Oh... Casper. What? Did you get my text? I've texted you like twice. Uh, no. Must have been them Canadian signals there, you know. OK, let me see your phone. What? Relax. Fuck, man. When... I need to talk to you, OK? Let's go outside. Come on. So why did the cow cross the road? I'm not in the mood, Casper, He wanted to go to the moo-vies. My little sister likes that one, so. Where were you this morning? What? Why are you so... I needed you. OK? And you... look. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this. What? Did someone die or something? I'm pregnant. I'm fucking pregnant. God. I need you, OK? Can we make it work? Will you make it work? Uh. Do you love me? Casper? What? Can we just then... Sorry. I'm not... I... we... just don't apologize, you know? Just my... just don't... just don't worry about it. Just give me some time. I'll figure it out. But don't worry about it, OK? I'll figure it out. I'll... I'm Casper fucking Cote. Yeah, I'll figure it out. I'm going to go figure it, OK? Yeah, I'll call you. I'll-I'll... I'll catch you later. OK, so has anyone here ever heard of the Jim twins? The Jim twins. No one? All of you? Jim Lewis and Jim Springer were identical twins, separated at birth, given up for adoption and raised by different families in different parts of the country, unaware that the other even existed. And then one day when they were 39 years old, they met. And they got to talking, and guess what? They found out that they both married women named Betty, had gotten divorced, and remarried to women named Linda. They both had sons named James Alan. They both bit their nails and had migraines. They both went to the exact same beach in Florida for vacation, both of them. They both love NASCAR, hated baseball. They both voted the same, drank the same beer, smoked the same cigarettes. When it was all said and done, they both died apart on the same day from the same illness. That's fucked up. Well... yeah, that's fucked up. We don't say that, but yeah, it is. So just think about how maybe some of those choices, maybe they're... maybe they aren't choices at all. Maybe some things are beyond your control. And so now, going back to the story, well, where do you guys think that Pony Boy falls in... in all this? Because certainly he's dealing with a lot of peer pressure, right? He's hanging out with his older brother, with Soda Pop, So where do you think he falls in all this? Anyone got an id... Casper? Can I go to the bathroom, please? We're about five minutes away. You can hold it. You want to take your boots off the table there? Right. Genius. Great. Take your socks off, or you're going to the office. Take your socks off. That's good. That's great. Now you can take your feet off the desk. Smart guy. Now I got to put the socks and shoes back on, man. You could have just said that there. Well, I could have. Would have been... jeez, your room's a mess here, teach. My room's a mess? Yeah. Well, I got to go to the bathroom anyways. Hey, you want detention? Yeah, sure, teach, give me detention. Yeah, it's a big joke, Everyone's aware you're such a tough guy. You want me to show you fuckin' tough guy, teach? I'm not, because you're starting to fuckin' piss me off right now. All right. Yeah, you said that five fuckin' words... Yeah, fuck me. Here. OK, easy. Hey, old Pony Boy. Good people make bad choices. It's fuckin' easy. I'm smarter than you. So you and Casper would move to Boston together? Yeah. Yeah? OK. But not... So you've been coming to this school since you were six years old, right? Right? Yeah. And now you're 17. That's 2/3 of your life you spent here. Guess I know you pretty well. I... I know your family. I know your circumstances. And it really angers me that you might throw it all away. I would imagine that you've got a plan. You've got a plan beyond high school. Have you even thought about which colleges you might like to try? You act like you want to be punished. You act like you want to be thrown out of school. You act like you want to be a failure. Here's what I want you to do. And if you want to come back to this school, please come back. But apply yourself. Follow the rules. Work hard. Behave! Or don't bother coming back. You're done. He's kind of a dick. Well, fuck him. Fuck him. Oh, he says you've got a bright future, though. He said I've got a bright future? Yeah. He started jerking off, just thinking about you. It's the truth too. Yeah, he does that. Get off. Badger's down at Tulsa. Go there. I said, Badger is down at Tulsa. Go there. OK, OK, OK. Jesse, go there. Jesse, get out of my... get off my por... close the fucking door. That's it. It's in there. What's wrong with Clayton? What do you mean? Wouldn't even open the door. You don't know better than that? He don't like doing business at home. Besides, he don't trust no one but family. Or fuckin' second cousins. Second cousins? Mm-hmm. That's all family. Everybody's a second cousin to everybody. Mm-hmm. You don't trust no one but me, OK? Mm-hmm. Look at me. You don't trust no one but me. Yeah, I don't trust no one but you, but... ahem... your brother's a weird dude. You're a fuckin' weird dude. Get the fuck out. Get out. Take your powdered donuts and get the fuck out. Fuck you. Fuck me? Well, fuck you, all right, Sal? Hmm? Sorry about that. That guy was bad. I don't like that guy. That guy was a bad guy. Hey, how'd it go? Um, got a bottle of big dogs there, yeah. Big dogs? Yeah. That's a good score there. And, uh, something that I think are hydros, maybe. Well yeah, I'll take a look. OK. Yes, sir. Hydros. That's real good. I can do that whenever you need, you know. Uh-huh. Book it. Looks like a rock there. Fantastique. And how is your, uh... how's your cunt mother? She's always in a bad mood, that one there, yeah. I know. Yeah. Has she shit out any more kids since I've last seen her dumb ass? Um... I don't think so, no. Well, um, tell her fuck you from your old man, will you? Sure, yeah. Yeah, well, I'll call you. Or just come by anytime. Yeah? Yeah, sure. All right. I'll... I'll be by, or you call me then, you know? I know, but I... I will call you. Good. Why are you crying? 'Cause, 'cause, 'cause you want a gold, gold, fish? I got to go get... Michael! Where's Mom? Hey, where's Mom? She went for a nap. A nap! That's where she is, huh? You eat lunch yet? Hey, go upstairs, you guys. Yeah, you. Upstairs. Gerard, take them upstairs there. I don't want to go to take a nap! I know. It's OK. I want Mama! You ever been shot with a potato cannon, Dayton? No. No? I bet it would hurt? Don't you? Probably would, yeah. Yeah. You want to see? OK. How about this? I sit here for 30 seconds. If you can get that thing loaded, I'll let you shoot me with it. What are you doing here, you? I live here, Kim. I told you not to bring that thing in the house. Oh, I could say the same thing to you. OK, mister big shot. You want to start paying rent, you can start having a say. Uh, I'm... I'm still... I'm still 17, Kim. Don't you get enough money from me being here? I'm sorry, baby. It's all right. I put on the moose video. Penelope started crying. Oh, did she? Oh, yeah. Dad says, fuck you! Yeah, well, fuck him too. I'm going to be late. Well, it's going to take me that long if I'm lucky. The car's making that weird noise again. Are you going to be here for supper? No, I'm going to the Tasty Food with Casper, so. Oh. What? Well, it'll have to do. Come on! Car. Well, I don't hear it. OK. Come on. Are we spraying them for bugs to protect the flowers? It's called Sugar Mover. It's like a fertilizer. But it doesn't protect the flowers. It kills the flowers. But why? We need to protect the potato. We don't want the flower to suck up all the nutrients. We need it to go to the tuber. That way it has a stronger, better, healthier life. If we don't, the potatoes won't survive. It's not easy. Farmer to make a living, it's not easy. You'll get sick and tired of looking at these, I guarantee it. But you harvest them right and put them in the proper environment, and they'll last you a good long time. All right, let's go, uh, pull them out of the ground. You know how I feel about you, Dom. You've always got a place here. You're a hell of a hard worker, and you're a smart kid. Dom? Yeah, what? Help. Hold on. I'll get it. Fine, I'm going to walk over here. Jeez, fucking rocks are heavy. You know, it's weird. I... I see you at school all the time, but we never really get to talk. Yeah, it's like, uh, harvest friends, right? We always talk during the harvest, but go back to school, it's... Harvest friends. So we're just harvest friends then? Ah, not yet. Ow! Oh, god. Oh, it hurts to even punch you, the backs of my arms are so sore. You had muscles back there, did you? No. I've never worked so hard in my life. Well, it doesn't really get any easier. Oh, yeah? Uh-huh. That's great, thanks. So why are you doing it? Ah. I'm saving up for next year. Mm-hmm? For college. You? Car. You've been working like this all year for a car? Two years. Oh my gosh, I definitely couldn't do that. Ah, you haven't seen the car. I should have enough with the harvest here. I ain't going nowhere. You'll let me know if you get an offer? I said I would. You're getting real close. Maybe a couple more checks, you know? Yeah. That's fuckin' kicked. Look at that! Eh? Let's go. I want to break some shit. Yeah. All right. That's what's up with that. Keep going, keep going. All right, come on! It's there. Just fuck it! Whoa! Holy shit! Let's go shoot it with some fuckin' potatoes, yeah? Yeah. All right. See if it's strong enough. Argh! It's all bullshit. You know, by third grade they've fuckin' decided, bang, who's staying, who's going. They're either going to care about you, or they're not going to give a fuck about you. They're always calling me into the fuckin' guidance counselor's office. And it is bullshit. They're wrong. But then again, none of it's going to matter anyway, so fuck 'em, you know? I knew you were going to fuckin' do that. This works out, we can make a fuck-ton of money, me and you. What about this thing with the Keegans? You know, where you've got 45 Hell's Angels just up the road there at Bear Lake? Hell's Angels want to do battle with the Keegans, who are running meth and coke south up. Meth's between the Angels and Phil and Bobby Keegan. Keegans being green-lit got shit-all to do with us, as far as I'm concerned. Is that... you mean "us," me and you, or "us," like you and your guys? Both. Both is fair game. It stands right now, that includes the gatekeepers. As long as we stick to running pot and pills, Hell's Angels got no business knowing our business. This works out with the Florida guy, we're slamming pills all down the I-95 corridor. It starts right now, right here, with us. Don't fuck this up, all right? Let's load them up. Hello, sir. How are you today? I'm good, thank you. How are you? Not too bad. What is your citizenship? I'm an American. Hold on just a minute, please. What was the purpose of your trip to Canada today? Uh, got a pizza at the Little House of Pizza. You purchase anything else besides the pizza? No, sir. Is there anything else in the truck that doesn't belong to you? No, sir, it's all mine. All right, thank you very much. Have a good day. Thank you. Did this guy do something wrong? Oh, I don't know, but we're about to find out. What about, uh... uh, Jesse's brother? What's his name? Ethan. Yeah. You know. Ahem. He said he would, uh, pay... pay me when he got his welfare check. He'd get the rest to me, uh, the first of the month. OK. Your job is to keep them between the ditches. They go off the road, they start to fall behind... All right, I'll talk to him. I mean, you know what I'm saying. Yeah, yeah. OK, well... my brother. Yah! Where's my fucking money? Give me my fucking money! Where's my fucking money? All right, seriously. I'm serious. He's my little brother! Whoa! Wait, too... that went on way too fucking long. I'm only kidding you, man. Oh, are you? Jesus Christ! Yeah, I've been working on some slight modifications. Oh yeah? Added this big-ass fuel tank back here. I think you're going to dig this. Get closer. Take a good whiff. Yeah, gas. Diesel. But over here we'll add 3/4-inch. You see that pump? Uh-huh. Give me the hose. OK. I'll plug it in. Kill it! Oh, shit! Yeah, three of them. Tighter than a midget's pussy. No more "frozen river in the middle of the night" bullshit. Now we drive it across in broad daylight. The pipeline to Canada's south runs through us. And with what we got coming up from Florida, we'll be working I-95 in both directions. Wait. Wait! What? Wait. I want to tell you something. Did I do something? No. What? Stop. I want you to know... What? That I can take care of you. I can take care of you and that fuckin' baby inside you. My baby inside you. And I promise I will. I promise. I promise I'm not going to fuck this up. I swear to god I'm not going to fuck this up. I'm going to take care of... of both of you. OK? Want to fuck me? Well, you fuck up this time of year, you're dead. And half their pitching staff is injured. And the other half just sucks. I mean, even if they make the playoffs, who cares? Hey, guys? Yeah? I could use some help over here. Yeah. Let me try to lift the roller up there. So. So, uh, do you like the Sox? I mean, I like some players, like Pedroia. Not rooting against them there, but not building my plans and dreams around them either. Whoa, man. She's shitting on your dreams. Are you OK? Yeah, Emma, I'm fine. You know, you said you were moving to Boston with Casper to go to Red Sox games, so I was just trying to be funny about it. You know, I... I get it. I get that you don't get it, and that's... that's OK. Look, I didn't mean to be mean about your friend there. I just... I don't know. I just always hear about all the trouble he gets in all the time. Like he got Tasha Nadeau pregnant, and she's like 15 years old. You sound like everyone else. They don't get it. It's like when... say you're out drowning on Long Lake and someone throws you a life vest. That's... that's Casper. He's there to throw you a life vest? No. No, Casper is the life vest. OK? You know, he's always been there. I know exactly what I'm getting with him. And then when I'm around him, I don't feel like I'm drowning. When I hang out with Casper, I know something crazy is going to happen. But you know, at least something happened. You know, I don't know very much about the Red Sox. But I do know that I'm supposed to hate the Yankees. Yeah. I got to teach you how to sweep. My god, this is terrible. You think that's going to work? Move. Fuckin' hammer. Here, this is how you do it. OK, it's on. It should pop up as a new network. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah? We got fucking Wi-Fi in this shit. Awesome! Relationship... you guys are in a relationship now, huh? I guess she's like your baby mama though, right? Fuck you. You know. Fuck it. Why don't you just click on her there? Oh, Emma Daigle there. Why would she be friends with Tasha? Oh, girls don't have to like each other to be friends on here. Girls don't have to like each other to be fuckin' friends. And that's the fuckin' truth there. Her favorite quote... sometimes good things have to fall apart so that... so that better things can fall together. Oh, yeah. You guys are all fuckin' geniuses. At least, that's what you think. You all think you're the first ones who ever thought of something. Like you're the ones who invented bringing shit across a border. Let me tell you something. We got you. You're done. Charged, but cooperating. You do understand, uh, cooperating defendant part? That's on you. For a felony, you're looking at starting at four years. So what? I do four years in jail. Oh yeah, OK. Jail. Jail is not federal prison. You're not a smart guy, are you, Lee? All right. Or do you know deep down inside that you are not smart? I hate Jesse. Don't blame your fuckin' cousin. No one's fuckin' solid no more. No, no, no, no. You're right about that. Drugs will do that to you. But Jesse, he's a bright guy. He wanted to keep his passport so he could cross over Said something about hockey and strip clubs being important to him. So when we asked him to wear a wire, that bright son of a bitch took all of about one and a half, maybe two seconds to think it over. Oh, he's a bright guy. He's in Canada right now with a big old set of titties flapping in his face, knowing him. Yeah. Then again, you've got nothing to lose. Right? Phew. You want us to tell the prosecutor you've been cooperative. You do realize that you are going to actually need to cooperate, right? Right? Fuck! I have children, 4 boys and 4 girls, and 12 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren. Hey, did you remember my cookie dough? I helped him move on after he served a tour in the Korean War. That was hard enough 'til I... Baby? Baby, what's wrong? Shit, that's so good. That is so good. Mmm, so awesome. Thank you. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I'm private, OK? I don't need your stupid fuckin' friends, none of that. Do you even love me? Tasha, why do we... you always make it like this. Do I love you? OK, my friends... my friends are not stupid, OK? That one's fuckin' stupid. What the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck is... come here. Look at me. Are you fuckin' drunk? Are you... you're fuckin' drunk. No. Look at you. No! Fuck me. No. Keep your fuckin' voice down. I'm not drunk. Yes, you... stop it. Smell anything? I'm not drunk, OK? I'm not drunk. And you're... you're an asshole. No. And you don't love me. And you don't love your baby, OK? Just keep your fuckin' voice down. Just keep your fuckin' voice down. Don't fuckin'... I'm having Casper Cote's baby! Asshole! Hey, asshole, how'd it go with Tasha? All right. Phew. You know what they say there. Sometimes good things have to fall apart so that better things can fall together, you know? That's very funny there. It is pretty funny. Now I know why you have to date 15-year-olds. Oh. Oh, fuck me! Hey! Moose safari. You guys want to go? What's a moose safari? "What's a moose safari?" Oh my god! Little pink flower, what's your little name? That was so fucking fun! Don't tell me that wasn't fucking fun. I told you it was fucking fun. Woo-hoo! We don't always get one. That was wicked cool. Sometimes they get killed if we, like, hit it, you know... Hey, man, you bumped into me. I... I don't want to start anything. I don't want to start anything. I'm just... Who do you think you are? Don't touch me! Casper? Hold this. Get out of my face. Casper. Casper! Casper, you win, buddy. Come on. Come on, buddy, it's OK. Get the fuck off me. Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Come on. You fuckin' put your hands on him, you put your fuckin' hands on me. You understand that there? You don't ever fuckin' walk in here and put your fuckin' hands on him! You go back to fuckin' Madawaska where you fucking came. Crack, take your fucking crack crew with you. What the fuck are you looking at? I said, get fuckin' walking! What are you looking at? Get the fuck out of here! Yeah, you! Your buddies are going there, kiddo. Casper, come on, man. Casper. You come around here, you ask about Casper fuckin' Cote. I run the fuckin' county, kid. Well... I am not feeling sorry for you. You're going to be late for harvest. Well, I don't even start until later. You feel good right now? It's the same story every time you hang out with him. God, it's not... it's not Casper. No? Oh, so is it you? Yeah, I don't think so. Trouble does not fall far from the tree. You're so much better than him. I'm... I'm not. OK, we're... we're no different. All you want to talk about is just me going and working for George the rest of my life. Yeah, because it's a good opportunity, and it's there if you want it. It's fuckin' here if I want it. No, I can't. I'm telling you, no, I can't. Uh, I'm... I'm fuckin'... I'm... I'm shittin' my... my guts out my ass here, OK? Uh, yeah, I've got food poisoned or something. I don't know, but I'm... it's coming out of both ends, and... and I can't... I can't make it. Five... five minutes. I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll, uh... no, I... I'm telling you, I can't fucking do it, all right? You're going to have to get somebody else. I'm sorry. OK. Hey. Wake up. Get up. I need you. Hey there, you! Hey! How you been? How you doing? Casper the Ghost, eh? That's my friend Dom here. Hi. What's his name? Dominic. Oh, Dominic. Yeah. Hi. You got a French name. Yeah. Yeah, my uncle couldn't come this week. Yeah. Yeah, so you can pick them up for him. Yeah. Yeah, there. You like them? Yeah. They're more Frenchy than yours. Yeah? Here, you wear mine. I like yours too, though. Yeah. You're ready for an ATV, you. Vroom, vroom! Uh, I mean, is there anything else we can do for you, or? Yeah. When you have time, you can do the bird feeder because it's too far out of my reach. Yeah. And then when you have more time, you can do some wood. "Anything else we can do for you?" Really? You know, I felt sorry for her. She makes $3,600 a month on pills she pays $4 a bottle for, all right? She should feel sorry for us. Pour it in. We're good? Yeah. Look at these fat birds. You see those holes there? She shoots the raccoons from inside. She'll just sit there, bang! Here you go. And, uh, thank you for your service, you know? You want some? No, I'm, uh... I'm good. You? No, no, I'm, uh... I'm good too, thank you. Uh, Mr. Borgia, we're... we're here for, um, you know... my uncle couldn't, but, uh... Right now the cheapest thing you can eat is peanut butter, but put it on a cracker with a banana pepper, it ain't half bad. Sounds good, yeah. Just give him the damn pills already and come back to bed. Do you have to talk everybody's ear off? Do you have to come out and chum up to every guy who comes in here? Bring the crackers. Come to bed. Let's get the fuck out of here. All right! Whee! Now, you did good. You did real good. Now, you want this to be something more than just an after-school special? You want this to grow into something bigger? Then you need to know the business, OK? OK. Now, Badger, he learned the business, but he don't know business. Mm-hmm. I mean, he got no mind for it. But you, with you we might have something. Who are we? You know, who are we in all of this? We're... well, we're... Little fish. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, we're little fish in the big pond, gasping for air. But the doctors that write those scripts and the pharmacies that fill those scripts and the companies that distribute all them big bad drugs... well, they're the big fish. You know? They're like Moby Dick. Remember? Yeah? Moby Dick in a fucking kiddie pool. The bottom line of the whole deal, we are just a spoke in a very fucked-up wheel. It's funny, you know? Almost everyone I know right now is working the potato harvest there. And I'm here. I would much rather be here than work in the potato harvest. So did George tell you you're going to be working with Josh tomorrow? What do you mean? Well, my parents are taking me to Vermont to look at colleges there. That's great. Yeah, it should be pretty cool. What? Then you're not going to back with the harvester for a while. Ow. Twig or something. Ow. Be careful. I want to get a place, like a place for us. Like... like for us and the baby. Before the baby comes, we should get a place. What? Don't you think? Uh... Don't you want to live with me? And I'm going to pay for that, though, right? That's what you're saying. Are you going to pay for it? I'm just saying I want to get a place. And I'm just asking you, who's going to pay for that there? Well, do you want people to think that you can't take care of me? Your own baby? I thought you said you were going to take care of us. Oh, don't fucking start. Don't get... stop. Don't fuckin' start. Don't... Tasha! Just... just shut up, please. Just stop. Just shut the fuck up, please, Tasha. Don't tell me to shut up. Tasha... Don't tell me to shut up. OK, I'm sorry. Just stop talking, please. Everyone's going to think you're a stupid jerk. Oh, really? Everyone's going to think Is that what they're going to think? On the fuckin' playground, they're going to think that I'm a stupid fucking jerk? On my best fucking day, they're going to think I'm a stupid fucking jerk. That's the truth there. I don't give a fuck what any of them think. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. What are you thinking about? What? Casper. Oh my gosh, why are you thinking about Casper right now? It's... here, let me... let me show you some pictures of my car. Oh, the car. The car. Check that out. Oh, wow. That's wicked cool. You know, I was thinking about the other night, and I think I get it now. You know, he's... he's really not half bad. Here. I always thought if I could just earn enough to get this car, then we could just go, and everything would be better. You know? Like everything we've been doing up to now has been to get to this one night. I'm so close. Casper just... I just thought leaving would be easier. Sorry. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's OK. Let's have sex. What? Yeah, we want to fuck, right? Let's fuck. I don't want to right now. Why not? I feel gross. Oh yeah? What? Take off your pants. What? Take off your pants. What? Either you take off your fuckin' pants right fuckin' now, or I'm going to take them off for you. Take off your fuckin' pants. Take off your fuckin' pants! Let's get the fucking pants off! Stop! You're on your period, Tasha. You're on your period. Uh... Fuck! Yeah, you fucking are! I see it right fucking there! What the fuck! What the fuck is wrong with you? Let me explain! Go ahead. Explain it to me. What? I don't want you to leave. Oh, fuck you! Then you don't fucking lie! You're a fucking liar! Fuck you! God fucking damn it! Stop! Don't go. Shut up. Fuck. OK, now. You see how it gets hot like that? Yeah. Goes red? That's when you add the filler metal. OK. See? And it melts it. It's like water. Oh. You see how I kind of fucked up right there? Yeah. All I got to do is just heat it up and move it with the heat 'til it's right and smooth. And then you just fix it, yeah? You just fix it, and nobody will know the difference. Now, pay attention. All right, well, you're doing the next one. This is fuckin' dangerous. I know. Don't hit me. Hey. OK, so I bring it over Tuesday. First thing Wednesday morning, you're going to go over to Portsmouth... OK. With that and what I already brought across. Now, he's not going to show up 'til later in the day, so you're going to meet up right at the motel. And I want you to take Casper with you. What? Oh. You know, I... I fuckin'... no. I can't. What? I'll... I'll drive it down, but not with him. What are you talking about? I'm telling you, I want him to go with you. You know? He needs to know the route, same as you. Well then, fuckin' forget it, OK? I mean... uh. You know, I don't need him looking over my fuckin' shoulder. I'm not looking over your shoulder. Is that what you think? I think this is about you and your fucking trust issues. Badger! Come back! What the fuck? Yeah. No, he'll be back. "Trust issues." He used to be a lot worse. And your trust issues. Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely my first choice. Uh, the campus is really awesome. They have this, like, big lake out there and, you know, like this giant outdoor mall. It was really cool. It sounds really cool. Yeah, it was really a good trip, you know? I'm really excited for next year. I had to work with creepy old Josh the whole time, you know? And I missed you. Yeah, I missed you too. So is something wrong? I just feel like I'm... I'm really starting to like you, you know, Dom, and I... I just don't want to give you the wrong idea, uh, and make you think that this can be more Because I don't know. I... I just think this kind of has to be a harvest thing, Like... like what you said. It's like... like harvest friends. Harvest friends, right. Like you and Austin. Right. Hey. Got your passport, kiddo? Yeah. I need you tonight. What? Oh, her? She's cute, huh? That's a fucking beast. That ain't no car, kiddo. I've seen your script run. Puts you over the top for your car. Yeah, put that away. I suppose our share is OK. No big deal. No big fuckin' thing. Turns out I don't need diaper money anymore, so. What? Don't worry about it. You got your passport, you? Why? We're going to a hockey game. Seriously? But why are you going again? Because I've got to fuckin' talk to the guy about some bullshit. Look, I don't want to fuckin' talk to you about this all night, all right? I'm late. Oh, yeah. Thank you. This thing's a fuckin' beast, no? Oh, yeah. It's a piece of shit. It's a... yeah. He's going to the Draveurs game, you know. Play in Grand Falls area. Ah, I hate Grand Falls. I know you hate Grand Falls. That's why I took you there. There he is there. Maybe he's doing his own thing or something, his own deals or something on the side, so. My dad's pissed, you know. It's fucked up. So, uh... I slept with Emma. Shut your fuckin' face. Oh, yeah. I fuckin' called that there. You did. You called it. How was it? Good. What? There's more to this. There's more to that "good" than just wha... was she a virgin? I don't know. Kind of uncomfortable, and we were in a forest with leaves and shit. No, you fuckin' weren't. You were in a forest? Yeah. OK. Anyway, she said that we're just harvest friends now, so. What? What the fuck is that? I guess I just wasn't part of her plan. And that's that, so. That's you being responsible? Just go! Fuck you! Oh, there he is. Down the stairs, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dun-dun. Let's go. You... you shut the fuck up! You're the one making all the fuckin' noise out here. OK, let's go to a fuckin' hockey game. Let's go. He's not even going in. I don't know what he's doing. He says he's going to the Draveurs game, and then he's, I don't know, sitting out here. Fuck. Come on, Badger, what are you doing? Maybe he just wants a lap dance before the game, you know? All right. Well, he's going in. What the... he's not going. Do you see that? I... I don't know. Why is he... what is... god damn it. Can I have your phone? Hey, it's Casper. My phone died. Yeah. Damn fuckin' right, he didn't go to the game. He... he... no, he's at Mon Copain. He just got into some guy's car. I don't know. Like, the guy just pulled up. No, he's... he was sitting here for a while. Then this other guy pulls in. He gets up like he's going to go in, and then he gets in this other guy's car. Yeah. Oh, wait. Wait, he's getting out now. I don't know. I don't know who the other guy is. OK. All right, he's driving off. He's going. And he's gone. And we're going to lose him. OK, bye. He wants us to follow this guy. That guy? Let's hope he's going to a fucking hockey game. So what now? I don't know. Just sit here and watch. What the hell is he doing in there? What the hell are we doing out here? It's fuckin' stupid, just sitting in this car. I mean, is this... you know, you just want to run errands for Clayton the rest of your life. That's what you want to do? Is that what you think I'm doing here? I want to be here right now? Thought we were going to a... to a hockey game, you know? Well, I'm sorry about the hockey game. I used to think we both wanted the same thing, but now we're sitting in a car instead of going to a hockey game. It makes no fuckin' sense. You used to think we both wanted the same thing? You know, you think leaving this town is everything, right? We... we leave the town, then we go into the Boston, and then we watch the Red Sox. That's the plan. That's the plan! Then what? What happens when the game ends? What? You tell me! Give me something to do. I'll leave, but you have no idea what kind of money I could make right here. See, you think you're doing something different. OK, you think like your dad sees something special in you, You're doing exactly what everyone in this town has expected you to do since the day you were born, you included. I'm... I'm the one who's always expected something more from something better for yourself. OK? This town has nothing that either of us want. We're meant to leave together. We're not meant to stay. Shit gets old fast, Casper. And it's going to get old fast. Oh, shit. Oh... Oh, fuck. Fuck! Shit. You're good here. Hey, where's Dom? What the fuck? Holy shit. I can't just drive the fuck off. Get down! Fuck! Piece of shit. There's three of them. Fuck. After this third, we can go. We'll go up quick and get the fuck out of here. Come on, let's go. Fuck! Let's go. Come on! What? Fuck! Straight to fuckin' voice mail, so he's already in fuckin' Canada. My god, your uncle is such a fucking douchebag. Come on, come on. See, maybe like... what if I said he didn't have anything to do with it, and that it was all me? And that... that I planned all this, and... and that he didn't do anything? OK. Enough already. He's my brother, OK? He's my only brother. And I love him. And now I'm fucking him! Yeah. Yep, that's true. He is your brother, and you are fucking him. We are firmly entrenched into fuck-you territory. You going to listen to me, Lee? Your brother is fucked in the here and now because of his choices, his actions. Only one of which is aggravated trafficking of scheduled drugs across an international border with his idiot fucking brother. This crying stuff, all this remorse, you've got to... this has got to be in the rear view. You've got to put that behind you. You've got to move forward. You've got to think about Amanda. You've got a baby coming. You've got to suck it up. You've got to man up. You've got to pull your shit together. Right. Here's how this is going to play out. Thank you. Suspect is leaving the port of entry. How you doing? Good. Can I get your license, registration, proof of insurance? Uh, Canada. Home. I'm just going to check your license and registration. I'll be right back. You guys all set? Just on a hunch, let me run my canine around the vehicle. Yeah, that would be great. Sir, I'm Deputy Miller Anything illegal in the vehicle that I need to know about? If you'll exit the vehicle, take 10 steps forward. Face away from the vehicle for me while I do the search. Hey, I've got this pizza here. I see it. You're all set. Jeez. Oh, he smells the fuckin' pizza. Go back to your vehicle. Put your hands on the hood while I search you and the vehicle. Walk back. Keep your hands out of your pockets. Put them on the hood. Spread your legs. Anything sharp on you? Any knives or needles at all? Bed's clear. Nothing will fit in there. So, uh, I'm done? We're done now? How much does the MDEA know about what they've been doing? I mean, how much do they know about us, what we did, you know? OK, we've got to... we've got to go. We've got to get our money. We've got to go right now. Casper, we've got to go right now! Fuck! Grab the funds. Grab the money. Dom? Dom! Dom, let's go. Dom! Come on, let's go. Fuck! Get the fuck out! No! Dom! No! You all right, Dom? Coming for you! Dom! Dom? Here! Ugh, over here. When I was about your age, someone really close to me died. And, um, my mom picked me up and drove me to the funeral. And I couldn't cry, you know? I thought there was something wrong with me because I couldn't cry. I knew I missed him, but I couldn't cry. And my mom said, don't worry, it's OK. It's not a race. There's no rush. It'll come when it comes. And, uh, when I got to the funeral, this guy I barely knew put his arms around me, hugged me. And he said, I wish you long life. And I lost it. I... I fell to pieces. And I... I wish you long life.
