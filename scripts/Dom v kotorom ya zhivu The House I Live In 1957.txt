Kulidjanov Released by Sovexportfiln The House I Live In - How nice! - .... - Here, let me help you. - .... We've got to send a cat in first, for luck. We'll send Sergei instead. Some others have come. Galya! You're a sight! What a lot of ragamuffins! - Somebody's knocking. - It's next door. I'll manage alone. Go and have dinner. You've got a rehearsal. Will he really jump? Bring another rope. You'll be late for your music lesson! I don't want to go. Then don't. You can't go looking like that! Must I stay here long? Until the new tenants come. As if I cared! It's the driver who brought out things. Thanks. What's your name? Nikolai. I found this kitten ... and thought you might want it. Put on your coat. I'm to be transferred ... to a touring car. Who are you? Nobody. Just sitting here. We're to be neighbours. I'm Dimitri Kashirin. And I'm Klavdia Davidova. Where are your things? - Is that all? - Afraid so. I'm a geologist. I have a cot I can give you. And this is my ... Are you sure I'm yours? A palace, eh? Mom sends you those chairs. Thanks, neighbour. Hang up your coat. Got a nail? Not even a nail. Here, Sergei. It's pyrite. Where'd you find it? On the bank of the Volga. He goes everywhere collecting stones. - What are nails made of? - Iron. And who finds iron? Geologists. If a geologist finds a stone like this ... it means there must be iron nearby. What must you do if you want to be a geologist? I know. Study your lessons. And be able to get up early in the morning. It's hard to get up when everybody else is asleep. Sergei, come and get washed! Sergei - 1935. Sergei - 1941. Hands off! Dimitri Fyodorovich gave them to me. A fine profession! Never home! This time I'll come home for good. Nothing is going to happen to me. It's myself I feel sorry for. Can't you understand? Afraid I can't. Goodbye, folks! Good luck, Katya. Off again? - Where'd you get this? - Dad made it. Can I have some dinner? Serve yourself, dear. I'm sure to die. Try it yourself ... The pains just won't start ... I suppose it takes time. Gone again. Deserts ... oases ... must be great! For whom? Maybe it'll go away? I'm the husband. Write us a note, Katya. Your turn next, Lida. Plenty of time. You may put it off till it's too late. Gayla! You're late! I don't want to study music. But I've got to if I'm going to be an actress. I wonder if it'll be a boy or a girl. It's all over! A girl! Nine pounds. Is that a lot? More than average. Have you seen her? They don't let anybody in. Hello, sis! I'm looking for the Davidovs. Konstantin! My son! This must be Katya's husband. Katya gave birth today. A nine-pounder! Above the average. Good for Katya! And what about me? Same old story! Lida, meet my eldest. Come and celebrate with us. What have you named the baby? Maya. Here's to Katya! To Granny and Grandad! I'm getting tipsy ... Let's drink to Dimitri Fyodorovich. He'd have been glad to join us. I must go. Good night. You've smoked up the room, son! Very well, I'll smoke in the hall. May I come in? Mind my smoking? Are you here on vacation? Yes, on my way to the sea at Sochi. First I wanted a little visit with the parents. Mom, where's Konstantin? He'll be right back. Mother is living with my kid brother - not in Moscow. I was studying medicine ... Go on. You find it interesting? Very. I fell ill in my second year and had to leave. I began designing textiles. Do you like it? Very much. And this? Even more. I hate them. I once dreamed of becoming a real artist. You have so many books! "Determining the Age of Minerals" They aren't my books. Good morning. Don't ... please ... She's another man's wife. And I love her, get that? So what? You were going to Sochi. Go ahead. What are you doing here? Teacher's sick. I wanted to ask you a question ... Suppose you were grown up ... and had a husband who loved you ... and he went away on a trip ... and another man made love to you. What would you do? I don't know. I'm off to my acting lesson. Do you know what it means to be an actress? On the stage she suffers, makes audiences cry ... then comes home and has supper. She dies, ... really dies ... and then ... gets up and makes a bow. It seems to be a safe profession ... but every role she plays costs her a bit of her heart. It is a hard profession and not as safe as it seems. When I was 16 I didn't realize that. Have you been on the stage so long? And I have to study years and years! Time passes quickly. Recite something. You must be more natural, dear. But there is so much feeling in that piece! Do you know what I was thinking? I was wondering why people don't fly. Sometimes I fancy I'm a bird. When you stand on the top of a hill it seems as if ... all you had to do was lift your arms and fly away. Shall we try it again? You try, Ksenia Nikolayevna. I have. What I said was from a play. Glad to see you back, Dimitri Fyodorovich. I knocked and knocked. Were you asleep? Come, dear, I won't go away again. Meet my son. Give the baby some peace. He just stands and smokes. Says he loves her. Speak to him. Tell him he mustn't. How can I? But she's married. I'll speak to him when he comes back from Sochi. Don't be nasty to her - she's so young. Did I behave like that when I was young? I can't bear the sight of her! Seventeen! Why, I'm grown up! Many happy returns. Who is it? Oh, Sergei. I thought it was a guest. Come in, Sergei. Gone? Run after him. Why should I? As if I cared! Ah, so he's decided to come back. We promised to go. They're expecting us. Has someting gone wrong at work? Don't forget the perfume. Shall we give her a book as well? Perhaps "Structural Geology"? Lida, what's the trouble? Come along. Are geologists ever in mortal danger? Sometimes. How simply wonderful! Why aren't you dancing, Galya? Do come in for a minute. I can't. I haven't been late for a performance in 40 years. And tonight is a closing performance. Best wishes. Turn off the music, Dad. - Why? - For an elocution lesson. If you don't like it you can leave. She's stage-struck. Why is it people don't fly? Why is it they don't fly like birds? Sometimes I fancy I'm a bird ... and have but to lift my arms and fly away. Go on, go on, we're listening. Go on with your fish. I'm sorry, Sergei. I must be no good at all. They ate fish while I recited. - Were they at your party? - Yes. He didn't eat fish, did he? No, not he. "Go on with your fish!" How do you like that? Why wasn't Sergei there? Have they quarelled again? Those two children can manage their own affairs. You were the gayest at the party. I got a letter asking me to come ... I've just got to find that pyrite. Go if you must. It'll mean only 2 or 3 months of work. Work! I'm used to having ... your work come first. I wouldn't mind if I came second. But work comes second with you, and third, and tenth! As for me ... Why did I buy that new mirror? To watch myself grow old? I'm going home to mother. Go ahead. I certainly will. I haven't even dared to have a baby. I kept waiting until we "settled down". After all, we only live once. That's the whole thing: we only live once. Perhaps I am unworthy of you, but I can't go on like this. What has happened? Now everybody's troubles are the same. War! I've heard. I can't find my bag. You going straight to enlist? I passed my last exam yesterday. In literature. We had to write a compostion on "My Favourite Hero". I wanted to write about you, because ... for me a hero is one ... who doesn't wait to be asked ... but does things of his own accord: and goes in search of minerals and things ... not for himself, but for others. But I didn't write it. They wouldn't understand. Yes. It's more important to be understood. Where could that bag be? GENERAL MOBILIZATION I took some things to the cleaners. - Are you leaving? - Yes. And what about your pyrite? You said you had to find it. Did you read my note? I left it here. You never read it, hear? Soviet Motherland! Turn out the light! - What have you found? - A globe. Our summer camp was here somewhere. It's quiet tonight. Like in the woods. You're going to evacuate? Mother says we must, but I don't want to. Looks like things have started. Always take me with you. Lie down. Sergei spends all his time with the Self-Defence Brigade. Be easy with the kid. Well, I guess that's all. See off Katya and the baby and send me their address. Collect my pay and send it to her. Don't water the plants much after the 1st of October. You'll be back yourself by then. Tell Sergei to come and see me off. Don't come with me. The car's come. I'm telling you for the last time if you don't come ... I'll kill myself. See that the baby doesn't catch cold. It's going to be hard for Katya. I'll help her. But why don't you come with us? I'm working in a hospital. - Where's Sergei? - I don't know. They've evacuated. They took your sweetheart with them. Keep this for me, will you? Pyrite? Don't worry. It takes letters a long time to come from the front. I know, Sergei. I'll keep it for you. - Must you shave my head? - Yes indeed. Must I show my passport? Yes indeed. We'll say we left it at home. I won't allow you to enlist! Didn't your father write: "Take care of your mother"? I'll go and tell them you're my only supporter. Do you want to kill me, son? I love you, mom. I think you're wonderful. But I'm going to join up anyway. From Sergei! Then I can go. Know how it is sometimes? I deliver a letter, then I have to call a doctor. So you've started to smoke? Not really. I've nothing to feed you, son. Why are you on such a short furlough? Heard anything from Galya? She's here. Came to see me. I'll be back in a minute, mom. It's cold. You'll catch cold. I haven't any firewood. - Have I got thin? - A little. I'm all right now. Are you hungry? She's hungry, mom! Eat some apricots. Mother sent them to me. I'll choke if you look at me like that. Your apricots and my porridge. The bombs frightened my maid away. She went to the country. Why are you laughing? Do I look funny? Some sailors presented me with this shirt. You're going to live with me now. I get good rations and we'll share them. I'll get rations too now. - You're working at a factory? - Yes. Isn't it hard? And what about your studies? Don't worry, you and I will go on studying. Not now, Ksenia Nikolayevna. Later perhaps. Later. Home. Thank you. I took a course in nursing... without telling anyone. And what about the stage? Later. We'll do everything later. How can I let you go, darling? A notice ... Seryozha? Father. Please go away. Ask anything but that of me. Don't come here anymore - not even to the door. You let me come when I had two legs. Can't you see? I never loved anyone but him! That's a lie! Didn't you love me... when he was alive? And if he were alive now ... I'd come to see you anyway. There's no one I need but you! Leave me. I'll keep my door locked. And I'll keep knocking until you open it. Is that my daddy? No, that's uncle Sergei. Did you put him out? He loves you. I know. What a wonderful day. Don't hold it against me. I don't. Has Galya's family come back? Don't go there, Sergei! There's no Galya! She was killed!.. Why do people fly like birds? When you stand on the top of a hill it seems as if ... all you had to do was lift your arms and fly away. Where are you, Dimitri? Perhaps roaming the earth ... in search of minerals. True, we live only once. How clearly I see it now! Where are you, Dimitri? This is your daddy! Do people grow fast? Some do. Uncle Sergei did. Sergei's come! Good morning. Good morning.
