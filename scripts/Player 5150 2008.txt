I promised I would never put myself back in this position and I'm right back where I shouldn't be. Why? Here's how it works. The Index Option offers the investor an opportunity to either capitalize on an expected market movement or to protect his holdings in underlying instruments. Can you hold on for one second, Mr. Alden? Carolyn, could you get me Mr. Haggerty, please? He's at Jeffries in Dallas. Thank you. Right away, Mr. Delgado. Mr. Haggerty. How are you, buddy? No. I'm good, I'm good. Call the charter, Diane. Push back my take off an hour. I'll see to it right away, Mr. Villa. What's your play today? I want two $1,000-bets on number three in the seventh at Hollywood Park. Firestorm? That horse is going out at a hundred to one. Haven't let you down yet, have I? Okay. Exactly. Right. More equity savings on the consumer side. Call Joey Delgado at Barman's. Ask him to meet me at Trump's this afternoon. Get my satchel out of the safe. Leave it with the concierge there. His name's Bobby. Ask him to seat us somewhere we can have some privacy. Okay. Okay. All right, bye-bye. Carolyn, I need Ali, please. She's at the campaign headquarters number. Thank you. Mr. Alden? Hey! I'm so sorry. Um... Right. Yeah. It sounds good to me. It does. No. We need his public endorsement. Not just some pat on the head. I don't care what it takes to get it. If we gotta get dirty, we gotta get dirty. We don't have time to deal with this. Joey's office's on line three. Hey. How did you do that? I was just thinking about you. It sounds pretty busy over there. Like you've got your hands full. Yeah, it's her. Something bad's going on. He must've done something and she caught him. You can cut the intrigue with a hacksaw. Headlines. Ali Brandt tied to Governor-Elect's dirty pre-election philandering. Listen, um, I have a meeting later today at Trump's with a client. By the way, your shirt and your slacks are ready at the cleaners for you. You called the cleaners for me? Yeah, why? Like you would? I guess I'll pick them up at the cleaners and then I'll come straight to you. Just don't be late whatever you do. I don't wanna be stuck dancing with Governor Groper until you get there. Actually, I'd like to see that. Yeah, you really would. Oh, I gotta go. There's my other line. I'll see you tonight. I love you. I love you, too, Ali. Bye. You want one, Beno? Not while I'm working. Oh, aren't you Mister Nine to Five? The punk here yet? No, not yet, T. Hey. Keep doing that shit. You gonna get the thins. More than you do for me, Tony. Dwayne's here, Tony. Little brave Dwayne. He's late. Give him a minute to think about it. Then send him back. Okay. Put that shit away and get out of here. Fuck. Tony? Tony. Why do you always make me leave every time you bring people back here? Because I said so, little girl. I'm doing business here. Go on out front 'till I have Z bring you back. You always make me leave every time you do business. Why can't I see this side of it? I'm learning the phones. It's part of business. You said you would teach me. Not this side of it, okay? Not this side. Go out front and have Z make you macaroni. I'm not hungry. Honey, you're killing me. Go. You want me give you a crack? You always crack me. I'll give you a crack. Go. Go. Next time I'm staying. I'm staying, Tony, even if. I'm staying. Next time. It's a good thing she's cute. Still I gotta rethink her. Beno, bring the guy in. You want the rest of the macaroni from yesterday? Don't me a dick. Well, look what the cat dragged in. Tony, how you doing? I've been better! I get a little irritable when I don't get what's mine in a timely manner. Good! Dwaine, Dwaine, Dwaine, Dwaine, Dwaine, Dwaine. What the hell am I gonna do with you, huh? I'll have the rest of it next week. Wow! Dwaine. Let me ask you. What do I look like to you? I mean, I'm standing right here. What do I look like to you? What do you mean? What I mean is, what do I look like to you? I mean, do I look like a Home Savings and fucking Loan? Huh? Not really. Not really? Do I look like a Wells fucking Fargo? I'll have the rest of it next week, Tony. I swear to God. Next week. The theory of next, right? I hate the theory of next. I do. We're gonna have a little lesson in understanding, okay? Okay? Yeah, come here. Come here. Knock-knock. I said knock-knock, Dwaine. Come on, it's a game. I say knock-knock. You say who's there? It's fun, okay? Knock-knock. Who's there? Dwaine. Dwaine the tub. Get it? I'm drowning? Isn't that funny? I'm "dwowning," Dwaine. "Dwowning." It burns! I'm sorry. Cool off. Cool off. All right. Life gets rough when you don't pay your fucking bills! This is what happens when you don't pay your bills. Okay? All right. Ooh, look at that there. Fuck! Get up. Come on. That'll heal. Here. Don't bleed on my floor. Okay. As much fun as that was, there's a lesson to be learned here. That is, when you owe the money, you gotta pay the man. Okay? Yeah, Tony. Sure. We're clear. You're gonna bring the rest of the 7,500 you owe me, plus another Ten thousand? Where am I gonna get $10,000? I don't care where you get it as long as you do get it. Okay? Otherwise Beno is gonna come after you, and that's gonna be even more fun than we had here. But look, take this. I'm doing you a favor. What the shit is this? Get out of here and get me my money. Beno, is it me? How are things, Joey? Th-things are good. Got a few concerns, Joe. Okay. I've been going over some of your work. You're hitting numbers like nobody in this office. Yes, sir. Joe, I've seen it a thousand times with young talented guys like you. It sounds basic, but, uh, are you getting your sleep? You're the first to arrive. Last to go. I love what I do. If that's what you mean. Oh, I know you do, but, uh, some of these decisions you've made they've made some of our clients a little nervous. Okay. A few of your calls, uh, were played like you were a swing trader. Letting sit overnight? The client has extreme expectations. These portfolios are the sum of the hard work of real people's lives, Joe. This company's reputation was built on being conservative. What you did is called gambling. That reputation can ruin a company. Mr. Barman... It's your job to contour our client's expectations. It's critical to our overall success here. Sometimes it can become a fine line can't it? And it's your job to know the difference. Yes, Carolyn? There's a deli delivery person here to see you. Uh, he says his name is Beno. Okay. Um... Yeah, uh... Yeah, send him back. Okay. Fuck. Hey, Beno. I was actually just gonna call you guys. It's right here in my organizer. I'm sorry you had to come out here. Really. My apologies. Tony's a bit worried. A bit worried that you forgot all about him. See, I've just been buying some time so that I can get my new picks together. That's all. Tell Tony that I'll be giving him a call right after the Oakland game. I'll have some picks ready. So I'm to tell Tony you're to call him today. Is that what you're saying? Yes, exactly. That's exactly what I'm saying. Okay. Just don't leave Tony hanging. All right. Take a club. A little something that help you make that early morning stock call. Jesus. Fuck. Whole game around, because under normal circumstances Pittsburgh would be favored by, oh, maybe a touchdown. But now Cleveland could very well be the favorite... Crap! Hello? Mr. Westin is on the line. He sounds panicked. Put him through. Hey, Mr. Westin. It's Joey. How you doing? Joey, you been watching your monitor? Introt's dropping like shit through a goose. Yeah, I got it right here. The last bid of Introt was at 221/2. I want you to sell all 15,000 shares at 181/2 stop. That'll save our margins. All right. I will do. Bye-bye. You didn't just do that. You whipped in here like this was your space. This is a handicap parking space. I understand that, but see, look. My problem is I gotta keep an eye on this monitor. If I'm driving around looking for a parking place it's gonna screw everything up. I'm gonna run in the cleaner for one second. Pick up my pants and my shirt. You've got to move this car. Do you have any compassion at all? You guys are all the same meter Nazis, you know that? Cut a guy a break for one fucking second! I said move this car! Otherwise I will be forced to tow your little cracker car with your butt sitting in it! How much do you make in a day? I was trying to be nice. You're gonna wind up getting this hot rod and pulling it out of the impound yard. Will these two bills right here settle the little battle of wills? You got ten minutes! Thank you. You bastard. Have a good day. What? Barman Jeffries. Jerry listen to me. I need you to sell all of Westin's Introt. Right now! All 15,000 shares out the fucking door. Sell right now! Pulling up the account. Selling 15,000 shares of Introt at 11. Whoa, whoa, wait. Hold on Jerry. Don't do anything. Oh, come on! Do you want me to sell? No! No! Don't do anything until I tell you. Okay, Jerry? Just hold on for one second. Oh, my God I Come on! Get over the marker! Come on I Get over the marker! Yes! Come on, Introt! Come on, Introt. Come on! Yes! Sixteen and a half. Come on! Keep going! Jerry! Hold on! Don't do anything! Holding. Are we selling? No! Hold, wait, wait! Hold? What do you mean? We're even! Sell! Sell! Right now! All 15,000 shares! Sell them! Order placed. Selling 15,000 shares of Introt at 19. Oh, my God. God, that's fun. Yo. It's player 5150, JD. Yo, T? Really? Hey, Joey. Hey! Que paso, mi amigo? Como esta? Mi compadre, de donde? Esta aqui. Esta aqui tells. I'm up to my ass in stock trades and ungrateful employers. I can't tell you. The grass is always greener, my friend. Beno tells me you want a counter? You're still carrying a rather large load that's outstanding. I was kind of hoping that maybe that ship would be sailing my way by now. I know. I know. And I appreciate your patience. I do. But you gotta know that I'm good for it, Tony. Come on. Okay. Just got back five. That brings you to an even sixty. That's 60 dimes still out far and wide. What are you thinking about today? Four games. Ten each. Four games at ten each? That'll bring it back to an even 20, which is manageable. But If they don't fall? That's the 60 you owe, plus another 40. That's 100 large, Joey. 100. Man chases more than anyone I know. I'm good for it, Tony. I'm good for every single penny. Okay? If they fall, I live to fight another day. If not, I will be in your office Monday morning to settle the whole thing. Every single penny. You lose, that's I don't have to tell you I'm going to want it. The juice alone should peak your interest. Okay, hot shot. Here we go. Four plays, ten thousand each. Who do you like? Cleveland. What did he say? He says that, uh, if we don't catch the guy, he'll find some people that will. Thank you, Angela! Thank you, Peter! All right. You've got the fingers for that. Tools of the trade, I guess. Oh! Thank you. Thank you for coming on such short notice. I appreciate it, Joey. Of course, of course. Oh, I brought you back some action to track from the strip. It's a long shot I heard some good things about. Wow. Firestorm, Must have heard some really good things about it. Well, sometimes chance outperforms even grace. Tuck it away somewhere. You never know. I will do. Thank you very much. There's $300,000 in here, Joey. I'm gonna leave it with you today. There's 300 in cash? Is that from Vegas? Every penny of it. Wow. I'd like you to park it in low-profile, small and safe growth funds. Oil companies, mid-caps. Even some penny stocks for that matter. Spread it around. Yeah, I can do that. It's just, um... I mean, today's Friday. Do you really want me to hold this through the weekend? You can wire it to me first thing Monday morning. I'm trying to avoid the tax signature. At least for the time being. Mr. Villa, here's my concern. It's a bit irregular for me to take a lump sum of this size. I'm just a client who's placed his confidence in you as my broker. Take it. Mr. Villa. Now, I... If my partners found out that I was taking commission under the table... Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's not a commission. It's a thank you gift. I appreciate the offer, but... Look. Buy Ali something nice with it. Make up for all the night's I kept you away from her. She deserves it. You deserve it. Go on, take it. A gift then? Okay. A gift. Thank you. Um, what are you having? Well, if I knew what charcuterie meant, I might have some of that. Hey. What's up, Jimmy? It looks like you swallowed a bottle cap. Two guys were parked outside the shop all day long. They just sat. Watching. Same guys? Guys just like Feds for sure. They see anything? They were locked on every person coming in and out of the yard. Back gates, side gates. All over the joint. Fuck. Them guys, they were watching. And who knows if anybody round here might start talking. Fourteen. No, switch it to fifteen. The line's changed. All right. You got it. Make some calls today, Jimmy. Let's get this moved offshore. Right. Oh, man. I can't sit down, man. Are you kidding me? My fucking ear, man! Thanks for the fricking, fucking back-up! Dude? Just relax. You're making us all nervous. There's no upside to all those jitters. You better get jittery, assholes! Next time it's gonna be your heads in a sink filled with cabbage. Get it? Oh, what do you mean us, man? Yeah. He doesn't even know who us are, man. He's not looking for Mike and I. We're not even on his radar. Oh, really? This guy will clean house. Our house. Your parent's house. Your fucking parent's parent's house, man! This guy don't fuck around! God, Dwayne. You're really starting to stress me out, man. The three of us went in on that bet. The three of us are gonna cover it. No. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! Are you trying to act like you don't know me now? You suddenly don't know me? Like... Like I've got fucking, fucking leprosy or something? Well, dude. Uh, we did just kind of meet you this year. So, I mean, who knows what you got, right? You got leprosy? Fuck you, man! Jeez. Chill out, dude. It's okay. It's just, those guys mean business, man. If I go down, I'm not going down alone. So, you two better step up in figuring this shit out with me. I'm not getting my head washed in burning cabbage again. That's for fucking sure. That shit was not pleasant. Hello? Is Ali Brandt there? This is Dr. Perry's office. Speaking. Ali? Can you hold for Dr. Perry? Sure. Hi, Ali. Dr. Perry. I have news for you. Okay. he crashed. Then 2139 took Pitt. They won, but didn't cover. Okay. What about the one-big? Twenty-three dimes. Who? Are you kidding me? She call you direct? Phil did. They're in town for some kind of fundraiser. She must have pressured him. Said she'd have him fired if he didn't put it in. So he put it in. Nothing more dangerous than a bored housewife. And during campaign season. Okay. Tell Bobby to collect his shorts. And get the stretch ready, Jimmy. If the Feds come knocking, we just may need a little bit of insurance. Lanzelin? Tonight we're gonna be right where we need to be. I'd first like to say that the political life in America today wouldn't have a fraction of the strength it does if it weren't for the hard work and enthusiasm of our young people who are committed to the day's pressing issues. Hard working and idealistic volunteers have been the backbone of this campaign. And at this time I'd like to personally point out one shining star on my team. Her hard work, dedication to the issues, and specifically for her unique and unrelenting perseverance. Ali Brandt. Thank you. I'm a little overwhelmed being up here. Um, this year's campaign has been a challenging one. Our opponents used negative ads from the get go. We chose to take the high road. But tonight is not just about politics. It's about friends. It's about faith. It's about family. It's about love. And it's about having fun. So let the dancing begin. Thank you. All right! Chalk is the favorite. Right. Um, the beard conceals the real bettor. Excellent. The diamond is when the juice is 10%. The handle... That's not enough. We're fucked. Data mining is searching through a large volume of statistics to find the profitable situation. Whoa! Very good! Excellent! See now, night school's paying off. Right? All mighty dollar. Beno, take five, will you? Hello, Mr. Bartender. Can I get you a drink, Ms. Lanzelin? Scotch, please. So, what do you think of your little Ali now, Mr. Big Shot Country Club Guy? Well, I think she's hot. I think she's beautiful. I think she's the smartest person I have ever met. And I also think the entire state of California is gonna be eating out of your palm, including me. You look different tonight. I do? Different how? I don't know. You just do. I saw Dr. Perry this afternoon. Really? May I cut in? I'd like to personally congratulate the person who's responsible for most of this. Hey, Mrs. Lanzelin. What are you doing out here all alone? I lost my picks today. Trying to rethink my counter. Are you kidding me? Um, my run of luck has been so horrible lately. I couldn't win a race if you sent nine of the horses to the glue factory and let mine skip the track. They should send him to the fucking glue factory. Oh, shit. Are you okay? Joey? You look a little sick. Beno! Get Joey on the phone for me, please. Joey? Didn't cover. Hey, Tony. No. I'm Okay. Okay. I'll be right over. See you in the winner's circle, Joey. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Okay, Jimmy. Let's set the hook. This is Phil. Phil, it's Nick. Uh. It appears the Mrs. didn't cover this afternoon. Don't wanna interrupt the Governor's gathering, of course. But, uh, we're in the neighborhood. Thought we'd stop by, check in. Say hello. Um, you guys parked away from the front entrance, I hope. Of course. For now. I'll call you back at this number in five minutes. Sir? Excuse me. Hey. What's wrong? You okay? No. I don't feel good. You don't feel good? Oh, my God! You're burning up. I know. I just threw up in the bathroom. You think this fundraiser is to be held just so I can hand it over to some bookie who happens to be sitting outside? Are you out of your fucking mind? You know what this could do to me? You are very attractive when you're leveraged. Isn't he, Phil? Please, I'm just... You gave me your word. At least until the election was over. You gave me your word. And you promised me you would be faithful, you son of a bitch. Until the election was over. At the least. You think I'm gonna lay quiet while you're out there barnstorming, and you're chasing every skirt that comes across our path? You have absolutely no regard for me. Joan, I... No! You know what? I have put my best on for you. From Chula Vista all the way up to the fucking goddamn motherfucking Trees of Mystery. I should excuse myself. No. You stay right there, Phil. I want someone to see the other side of this, so I know I'm not crazy. I'm just gonna go... I'm gonna go straight home. Are you sure you don't want me to come with you? Yeah. Stay. You can't leave when everybody's eating out of your hand like this. Here, sir. Hey! I'd like you to be discreet, of course. Of course. The more shadows the better. I'll have Phil take care of it right away. I want you to take it out of petty cash, Phil. I'll sign for it personally. Log it on to travel expenses. I'll cover it Monday when we get back into the office. Yes, sir. It's nice to see you so executive-like. In charge. Tough. Oh, poopsie! Are you sure you're okay? You don't want me to drive? No, I'm, I'm fine. I just, I need to... I need some quiet. Oh, um, what did Dr. Perry have to say? Oh, it's okay. We'll talk about it at home. Okay? You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Just feel better, okay? Bye. I'm gonna go straight home. Okay. Go to sleep. No, stay there! Dwight, Dwight, Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Man, I will have the rest of it next week. Oh, next week, huh? The rest of it was supposed to be here last week. I had to watch my little sister. My mom and the car. My brother at wrestling camp. Hey! I've fucking got sisters, man! I don't care! I don't care about any of that shit! I'm sorry. What do I look like to you? Huh? I mean, I'm standing right here. What do I look like to you? I don't know. Do I look like a Home Savings and Loan? Or a B of fucking A? Huh? Brian, turn the water on. Dwayne, these sinks don't work. Hey, knock it off, man! Get the fuck out of here, old man! I said knock it off! Get off of him! Let go of me, old man! Punk shit, come on! Come on, fucker! Put the bottle down! Fuck you! Let him go, man! Put the bottle down, or I'll choke him! What do we do? Drop the bottle! Put it down! Okay, okay, okay! Oh, fuck! Why don't you guys pick on someone your own size, huh? He's just a little kid! I just said let him go. Threaten me with a bottle? And you ask me to calm down? I'll cut you back to grade school! I'll cut you fags! Uh-huh. Hey, Lucy? Get a sandwich, honey. What? Mm. Come on. You're an asshole. Yeah. Baby, don't be so mad. Don't hate me because I'm beautiful. Yo, T. Hey! My man! I thought I was gonna have to send Beno after you. No, not me. You ain't gotta tell me twice, Tony. But, um... Why the rush? I still have three games going. Seventy thousand dollars. That's a lot of money to be out, Joey. I just thought maybe we'd make it clear about our arrangement. Well, I thought the arrangement was Monday. I'm thinking I'm gonna need a little good faith. Tonight. Good faith? What... What the hell is that? Something down, my friend. Are you kidding me right now, Tony? Do you have any idea how much I've been in to you in the past and made good on it? Do you? Cause it's every single fucking penny, man. And after all of that business, suddenly you're putting the squeeze on me like I'm some sort of flunky that fell off a prune truck? What the fuck is that, man? Don't "man" me you little day trader piece of fuck-meat. I've been carrying you since you started with the blow. You've been late not once, not twice, but every single payment that you owe me, hot shot. And I'm thinking right now things are no different. Or the 60 dimes I've been out for how long now? Huh? I don't know! Beno, how long they been out? Five weeks. Five weeks I've been carrying you. You know what kind of stuff does to me on the streets? Bad business all the way around. Now look. If the rest of your plays don't fall for you this weekend, you're in for 100. You understand me? $100,000, Joseph. Don't do it. Stop! What are they doing in there? Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Stop it! It's in my pocket. What? There's $10,000 in my fucking pocket. It's in my pocket. Hey! Shut the fuck up! All right. This just bought you off the slab. Pick him up, Beno. This is what we're gonna do. You watch your plays. I watch your plays. You lose, you better have my fucking money. Or I'm coming after you, I swear to Christ. All right? 'Cause if I don't have it in my hands first thing, then I'm coming after you. And Beno's coming after you. Do we have an understanding? Yes, sir. Good. Get him out of here. Good luck now. Yeah. Is that what happens? Oh. My God. Sorry about that. He's been getting rough lately. Yeah, what the fuck? He's not normally like this. He owes a lot of money around town. Right on down the food chain, huh? By the way. Thanks for that tip. Oh! The stock is performing really, really well. Oh. Good. Good. Yeah. It's climbing steadily. That's a good one for you. I owe you a big one. Yeah, I might need that one day. Shh. Don't push that button, Z. Hello, Tony. Beno. I was just out there. Yeah. Just go. Ooh, sorry. Sharp girl. Yeah, a real scholar. Hello, Nick. I just came by as a friendly reminder that I'll be very interested in settling up our outstanding account. My markers are due on Monday. Ah. That is if you can count on your own clientele making good. I hope you can. But, nonetheless, not really my concern. My concern is my own clientele. And my own clientele is you. I've been carrying, I imagine, most of your debt. I'm gonna need some sort of down payment now, Tony. Some good faith. I'm sure you understand. I don't like carrying small time penny ante thieves like you. And I don't even like coming here to places like this. But the world we live in, huh? Take this. It's ten. It's ten grand. Accept it with my apologies. And Monday morning we'll square up. I hope you're right for your sake, Tony. I don't want to have to come here again. Yeah. We understand each other. Good. Fuck! What's going on? Hey. With all the focus on the Governor's fundraiser, Ali forgot to remind me her parents were coming for the weekend. I guess I deserved that. She thought she'd also invite my own parents. Not so sure I deserved that one. Gary owned a fax company. Jane liked to take vacations with her girlfriends. As far as my own parents, they were just doing time. A couple of games later today I want to make sure to watch. Maybe we'll sit down and watch them together in the living room. I know! I'm excited. I was in the hole now for 70 large, with 3 more plays. Putting on the in-law face was nearly killing me. Get back to his left. No! He is hit, he goes down. And it looks like he has injured a knee. Gary was a firm believer in winterizing, and I was doing my best not to poke his eyes out with an ice pick. I was thinking if I somehow left him alone, I might just wake up with a new roof in the morning. Seattle was down and I was on the verge of choking another 10,000 which would put me at 80,000 in the hole. On the in zone! Touchdown Seattle! I knew Tony was just waiting for me. They couldn't do it. Seattle loses big to Miami. Don't go Seattle. Arizona came on in an hour. And San Francisco was the first game on the following morning. We'll have the opening kick-off in two minutes. You don't want to put the barbecue sauce on too early. You wait 'till the meat starts to come away from the bones. You know the chicken's done. You don't wanna get no salmonella. Then you put the barbecue sauce on. I could feel the pressure of it all when I took issue with Gary working my barbecue. You can't just parachute in on a guy's barbecue. I finally got rid of those damn spider veins. I could go on a cruise and be okay. The best I could do was win the remaining two and get back to 60 minus the juice. Arizona was on the fast track to getting cleaned. Ninety thousand bucks. Now the best I could do was owe Barman was ready to fire me. Nick was asking me to wash his money. I nearly soaked Westin's daughter's college fund. My bills were late. I've nearly run out of money. And I wouldn't be surprised if they turned my lights off. And then it came to me. Just like that. Vegas. I'll be right back. Okay? Jerry and I are just gonna play a quick 18. I should be home by 4. Four. Okay? I'll call you later. I was down 90 large. Bye. With one play left. Tony wanted his money. He knew where I worked. And he knew where I lived. My only option was to get to Vegas, get 100 on credit, and get right back. I figured the golf alibi was gonna be good for nine or ten hours. So I could drive, get to Vegas, get the marker and still get back in time for dinner. Here you go, T. Made it fresh. It's our shooter. We better get to him before Mr. Lim does. Yeah. It can be a penalty flag against San Francisco. The middle linebacker was across the line. That's gonna to cost San Francisco five yards as a gift to Washington. Johnson took pass. He's under pressure. And he is sacked by San Francisco's middle linebacker, Jason Langford. At quarterback is Johnson. And he's got a wide receiver in Mitchell, left. Wilson wide to the right. Going back to pass is Johnson. He's under pressure. He breaks away from one tackle. He's almost in the in zone. He fires. Fuck! He deflects it. Wilson's got the ball! And five. Touchdown. And Washington had the best year. Can't believe what just happened. Washington pulls up. Okay. That's it. You're in his office at 9:00, Beno. To 35. That was a kind of play that was a Hail Mary as the defensive back... Nobody deserves this kind of luck. I should've bet on myself losing. At least that would've payed off. Tony is gonna be sending Beno over to the office first thing in the morning to collect his money. That, that's priority number one. As far as the hotel and owing them, I could always deal with that later. I knew that they wouldn't come after me and break my legs. At least not right away. Joey Delgado. Welcome back to Vegas. Go, go, go, go. Everybody out! Bingo. He's got the cash. Go. Move, move. Put your hands on the bar. Put your hands on the bar. Do it now! Cuff him up. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney present during questioning. If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you. Do you understand your rights? I'll take that as a yes. Get him of here, guys. Let's go. Ay, ay. Nick. They just hit Moffin's place. Cops are everywhere. Get everybody out. Get this place broken down. Clear the pen. Clear it. Just clear the fucking pen. Now. Okay. For 100,000. We need him to sign right here. Good luck to you, okay? Okay, Joey. Have you heard from Joey yet, dear? Does it take this long to play 18 holes? Me dinner's gonna get cold. I'm thinking I'm gonna need a little good faith. Are you kidding me right now, Tony? Do you have any idea how much I've been in to you in the past and made good on it? Do you? You watch your place. I watch your place. You lose, you better have my fucking money. Or I'm coming after you, I swear to Christ. All right? 'Cause if I don't have it in my hands first thing, I'm coming after you. Moffit. Looks like you made bail. Thank you. I overestimated him. He's nothing but a fucking snitch. You sure it wasn't the other guys? No. This is Joey. Joey told me to buy more time that put me away. Nick. Nick will be coming for his tomorrow. Yeah. I worry about Nick. Yo. 5150 JD. It's 5150. Hey, tell Tony I got all of his money. I'm in Vegas. I'll be back first thing in the morning. Be at my office with your hamper and we'll settle the whole thing. All right. He says he's in Vegas. He's gonna be back with the money. Oh, my God! Change 10,000. Changing ten? If he's actually in Vegas, that kind of money is not gonna last long. What do you wanna do? Cover his house. Get those two guys we work with out there to find him. Tell them to start with the hotels on the Strip. Check the highlight at Blackjack tables and sports books. Good for you. Bye. Bye, Mom. If you hear from him, would you just call me, please? Call me as soon as you hear anything. I've left messages... Thanks. Bye. Hey. I came as soon as I got your message. What's going on? Yeah. I don't know where he is. He was supposed to be home at 4:00. He went golfing with Jerry. Ali, I was with Jerry all day today. What? I was with Jerry all day today. There's no way he was with him. Great. Hey, Joey. You need to relax a little bit, bro. Let's go to the bar and have a drink, okay? This table's not going anywhere. Come on. Let's go. Yeah. Mm-hm. Anything? He's a no show. Imagine that. Fuck. He didn't come in this morning, Ali. He's not picking up his phone either. Okay. I'll, um, I'll come over after the markets close. Thanks, Jerry. Hey, Joey. Are you interested in fire? Whatever gets the job done. I don't want anything getting back to me. Nothing ever comes back with fire. You want it positioned and you want the hand out. Fun to watch thing burn, isn't it? Leave me! Let go of me! Shut up! Go! No! Please! Oh, my God! Please! No! Yes. Hello? Joey I see you've met my asian counterparts. Hey, Tony. Listen, I had your money. You don't have to do this. I swear to God I'll pay you. I swear to God. You know, I understand, Joey. I do. It's like the rat trying to bring the cheese home. Never gonna happen. Your heart's in the right place. It's just somehow something It's getting away. Which is why I'm gonna let you live. I found a way to make this all work out for both parties here. See? Little visit to your house today. Nice sticks. Very nice. I also did a research. Nearly payed off. I'm gonna need both your signatures, Joey. Yours and Ali's. Did you touch her? Yeah. I did. Now, put my friends back on. Yeah. He wants you to call your wife. Ali. Hello? Ali? Where are you? I fucked up really bad. They were just here. What have you done? I knew the minute I heard the pause in Jerry's voice. I'm so sorry, Ali. I'm sorry? I'm sorry? Well, maybe I should give you guys a little... No, no, no. No. Stay. Wait a sec. You promised me. You promised me the first time when you gambled away even your tuition money. This would never happen again. And I believed you. You asked me to believe you, and... I did. I stood by you for years. And you swore to me. Remember? You swore to me that this would never happen again. I'm a fool. I mean, I've the world by the tail, but I'm absolutely no smarter than I was when I believed you the first time. And what you asked me I stupidly thought was sacred. And all I thought as much as a second thought it was just... It was just that easy for me. And the funny things is... The funny thing is, is don't know if that's love, or if it's just something that I'm... holding on to you, you know? I always thought I was smarter than this. I thought I was smarter than being here again. But I'm not. I'm not. Look at me. Look at me! You wanna know what it looks like to break someone in two with just a flick of disregard? Look at me! Look at me! Look at my face. This is what it looks like. Stare at it. Look at it. Kinda looks like hell, doesn't it? I'm pregnant. Yeah, I'm pregnant. Don't fucking cry! You don't have the right to fucking cry! Look who just showed. Moffit. It must be the weekend pay off. Hey, Jimmy, turn the heater on. Oh, shit! Oh, my God. I'll never forget the look on Tony's face as long as I live. He saw me standing there with the deed to my house in my hand, and Lucy with a sandwich in hers. There he was getting arrested for the murder of Nick Villa and Jimmy. The look on his face. Tony decided to hit before being hit. Meet sense business wise. One less bookie on the block. Tony didn't count on the Feds across the street who were watching Nick. Now the state had two eyewitnesses who just happened to be federal agents. Firestorm. Who would've thought? Hundred to one. My debt had been wiped clean. but at the cost of a client and a friend. Ali agreed to meet with me. I gave her the ticket worth 100,000 and the leather case with the 300,000. I told her about the marker from the casino, and I'd use the rest for rehab. She knew we were meant for each other no matter what had happened. So did I. No matter what happened. We were just made that way. She finally agreed. I was on probation. And I, I was fine with that. Three hundred thousand from Nick, and 100,000 from Firestorm. And the house was still ours. I guess he was right. Chance can't out-perform grace some times. The clinic said my gambling stemmed from my work. The rush of the trade had to be met with the rush of the bet. The pressure of the office created a pathological state. Oh, yeah, sure. That made sense. Hey. Hello. How is it going, Mr. Lin? So that and whatever was on eight. Okay. 17. 95. Right. There you go. Here's the change. Thank you, sir. Hey, what's the Powerball paying at right now? I don't know. Okay. Uh, never mind. Hey, have a good one. Thank you, Mr. Joey. Bye-bye. A scandal ensued with the Governor Elect's wife. The Feds found Nick's ledger and tied it right to the campaign. Ali was out of her job, so she became a full-time mom. Hello? Yeah, one second. It's for you. It'll all seem like the edge of everything all gone away. No, I got him. Hey. But... nothing's ever that easy. It turns out that Tony still wanted me anyway. And even from prison there's a hit. Zoran was released and not associated with Nick's murder. He still thought obligated to me from that stock tip. He said it was going down today. Nobody gets off as easy as I did. And deep down I knew it. My life had changed. Ali, my four-month old I know I had to hit it. It was my time. Zoran said today was the day. I couldn't do that to her again. I couldn't. So I knew what I had to do. Paper, okay? A hit was a hit, and I knew it was coming. But like Firestorm I don't want him to be taking me so far. It's true. Time was a great teacher, but unfortunately he kills all of his students. Okay. Now, this isn't a place where normally I would get cocky, but... Even time itself can't beat a good insider tip. Hi! Hey. Good morning. I mean, what are the odds? Fifty to one? Fifty-one to one? Fifty-one fifty to one? One little bit. Oh, come here. Hey, Ali. What do you think of Northern California? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen next number coming now. 56! Anybody gonna hit bingo? Like this year. It's ridiculous. Next number coming out. 75. O 75. Two takers. You working on diamond play yet? Not yet. Nothing? All right, next number coming out. 51. G 51. No, no takers. I'll raise the stakes. $5-bet. 75 to 1. I can cover it. Totally good for. Anybody take it? $5-bet. Jerry! Yeah! You're my man! You're wild. Here it comes. Call the number. Seventy-four. Forty-four? Seventy-four. O 70! I was almost out! Oh, that was bad! You owe me $6, Jerry. All right? I'm keeping tabs on you. I don't wanna play your security check, but I will if I have to.
