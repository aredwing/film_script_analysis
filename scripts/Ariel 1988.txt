You'll drink yourself silly and just get frustrated. Take the car keys. It's your inheritance. You always liked it better than the others. They're no good anyway. If they don't stay here,... ...they'll go hang themselves down south. I've had it with this shit. But don't follow my example. This is shit too. - How much? - All of it. 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79... 8,000. Thanks. The evening comes on with a low sigh Lights come on behind the windows No one else stays behind in the dark As the lights drive away The shadows of the night I don't turn the lights on I don't think I need them now You're my brightest light Even brighter than I deserve A hamburger. Nice set of wheels. Yeah. What sort of eggbeater? Eggbeater? The engine. I don't know. Pop the hood. Let's check it out. Forklift drivers will be Salminen, Niskanen,... ...Mattila, Tallstrm, Pesonen,... ...Laine, Markkula,... ...Jokinen, and Vaisanen. And a few not on forklifts:... ...you, you, and you. You. - Name? - Kasurinen, Taisto. 256 marks. Whose is this? I found it on the trash bin. Makkonen's. He got run over by a forklift. Keep it. Thanks. Where do I sign? Nowhere. We borrowed your radio. That's okay. You know anywhere I could spend the night? I do. Where? - Give us a ride? - Sure. - Got any room? - Bed or mattress? - What's the difference? - A bed's 30 marks a night. A mattress is a little less. You get no sheets. A bed. Hello. Hello. Hey, gimme the funny pages. Here. Make up your mind. I gotta go. Good afternoon. Sorry. - Who do I complain to? - To me, personally. Is there anything I can do to expedite this matter? A dinner wouldn't hurt. Fine. Let's go. Not while I'm on duty. I'll have to quit first. It was a stupid cap anyway. Thanks for the evening. My first time in a convertible. - The top doesn't work. - I know. It's dark. Want to come up? If it's not too much trouble. Coffee's all I've got. Coffee's fine. I'm divorced. - Don't let it get you down. - I've got a kid too. Gives us a head start raising a famiIy. Are you always so confident? No, this is the first time. - Just don't make any noise. - No one will even suspect. Really? I hope I won't regret this. Irmeli. Taisto. Nice to meet you. Likewise. I think we've met somewhere. I saw you once in a bar. Do your friends call you Tasi? I have no friends. Everybody has friends. I'm from the countryside. That's different. Now you get the picture. Was your husband a drunk? No, he found someone else. Where? I don't remember. The whole thing was a mistake. I hated him from the start. That's unusual. That's what you think. Will you disappear in the morning? No, we'll be together forever. Good. I start work early. Good night. Coffee. Toast or crispbread? Crispbread. It's broken. Mother said to call her. Aren't you going to work? METALWORKING JOBS I can't come right now. Come meet me here at 4:00. Bye. Found anything? No. I'll have to keep on at the docks if there's still work. Can I see you tonight? - No, I'm working. Where? Bank of Finland, as a night guard. I need the money. The whole apartment was furnished on installments. You still owe a lot? Nah, I'll be okay in a couple years. Nice wind. I lost my dreams and everything in life I lost my dreams because of you Now I'm lost in my dreams I hide from the world I look out the window and watch the rain come down I miss you, my love HOMELESS SHELTER Kasurinen. What? You owe us for four nights. I know, but I have no money. Go and get some. How much do you want for it? At least 20,000. 6,500. That's all? Nobody'd give any more for a heap this old. All right. Leave the car here. I'll have the money in the morning. Okay.

What do you do normally? What do you mean by ''normally''? I've always been here. What will you do when you get out? Kasurinen. You have a visitor. Hello, Tasi. Hello. How are you, Tasi? All right. I've got a job. - Go and play somewhere. - Where? In the hallway. - Will you marry me? - Here? No, on the outside. All right, but how? You take care of the paperwork. I'll come when I can. You can't. Listen, Mikkonen. I don't think I have a choice. I'm thinking of getting out of here soon. I see. How? Don't know yet. Somehow. Getting out is no big deal. Lots of guys have done it. But they were brought back... ...and ended up doing twice as much time as before. They stayed around here, or went to Sweden,... ...or headed to the nearest bar and got loaded. You've got to get further away. Italy or Africa,... ...at least for a while. I've been thinking about Mexico or Brazil. Even better. But that takes money. You think I haven't planned it all a hundred times? First you need three grand for a passport,... ...then ten more for the seamen to hide you in the cargo... ...and let you off... ...somewhere around the equator. But it's dangerous. If the cargo starts to shift in a storm. Lots of guys have died that way. You gotta go underground... ...until you get a passport and find the right ship. How many years do you have left? Eight, for manslaughter. But I'm innocent. Are you? At least in God's eyes. In a way I did kill him,... ...but the truth is I didn't. The result was the same: He died... and I was sent here. AII right, let's go then. I'm 37 now. Eight more would make me about 43, more or less. But I won't last three hours outside without killing somebody. Kasurinen. What? You can take that mop to bed with you tonight. Why? Pretend it's your wedding night. Kasurinen, Taisto. You can't see him now. He's in solitary. - Why? - For violent behavior. He's not violent. The guard whose jaw he broke disagrees. - It wasn't him. - Come back Sunday. He'll return to his cell tonight if he calms down. It's his birthday. Would you give these to him? Happy birthday. I didn't mean to start without you. Age has given me a sweet tooth. But nobody sends me anything. It's my own fault. When other boys had their eyes on girls, I sat in juvenile prison... ...for taking an old crippled granny's sleigh. Mikkonen. What? It's not my birthday. It's in the winter. The deal's off. - You can't do that! - Why not? I hear bitter laughter echoing in the darkness Tonight I won't accuse you of anything Because for you I would walk through a desert haze On this autumn night my mind is blue Tonight no stars shine to comfort me I guess it's useless to hope for anything Best to drown myself in the night Where's the other witness? There is no other witness. I'll get someone. Before these witnesses, I ask you, Irmeli Pihlaja.; Do you take Taisto Kasurinen as your awfull wedded husband... ...in sickness and in health? I do. You having both answered yes to my questions,... I now pronounce you man and wife. What? Dad, the cops are coming. Four thousand... each. That's a lot. There's not much competition. All right. Where will you get the money? Don't you worry about that. We could help you. All right. Get us a car and a gun. What's our cut? The passports are part of the deal. A quarter... Regardless of the take. Half. And you can sleep here before and after the job. - And if we get nothing? - Every business has its risks. When will the passports be ready? In the morning. All right. Half. We need a car in the morning. Give me the gun. Let's go. - How much did we get? - Enough. I'll get the passports. You wait here. Why? I don't trust them. How did it go? Where are the passports? - That car was a piece of shit. - I know. It wouldn't go in reverse. Let's split the take. I think we'll take it all. You're a risk to me. If you get caught,... ...you might sing. The other one's still outside. Go get him. Mikkonen. Take the money and disappear. I have to go, and I can't take you with me. Be a brave boy and wait here for my call. Meanwhile you can pack your littIe suitcase. Put in everything you want to take along. We're going on a trip. - Irmeli. - What? Be sure to call. We have to get him to the hospital. I know. Stop it. The ship's called Ariel. Tonight at 10:00 off Hernesaari Point. Bury my heart at the dump. What's this button for? I understand. Bye. There's a package for you. Over here. Where's Mikkonen? He won't be coming. But there's three of us. I'd like to see the money. All right. Let's go. - Where's the Ariel headed? - Mexico. Didn't you know? Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high There's a land that I heard of Once in a lullaby Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue And the dreams that you dare to dream Really do come true
