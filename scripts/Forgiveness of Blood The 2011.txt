So are we going to the beach this weekend? he water's still cold. l don't care. Even if it's freezing, l'm going in. No matter what, huh? We're going in no matter what. Oh, you two are tough, huh? You afraid of the water? - Yeah, it's happening. - We're going. Hey, turn around. - Nik. - May l? - Where have you been? - With friends. Have a sip. l can't drink that. - Come on. - l can't. he kitten doesn't drink vinegar, huh? - Cheers! - Hello, Shpend! - Hey there. - Still celebrating? Help yourself. - How are the bride and groom? - Young and in love! Hey, Mark. Are you collecting cigarettes? ake it. ake Nik's too. Wait, l'll give you another. Very generous of you, Sokol, but l don't want to get in trouble. hey might be stolen. At least we earn ours. Relax, Mark. You must be tired from moving the stones on my land. Maybe they move by themselves. Better be careful, Nik. You never know where those stones might fly. Sokol, may you never get fat, or you won't be able to work our land. o your health! Here's to the health of your horse Klinsmann, and those shortcuts he takes. Klinsmann thanks you and leaves his respects wherever he goes. Even without Klinsmann, we'd pull our cart across our grandfather's land. Cheers! Why don't you go around, Mark? You never know. Sometimes the long way is shorter... and safer. Stop it. Enough. Cheers! Cheers, old man! Who you calling an old man? Here you go. Milk. l'll get that. Go get ready. Get the tomatoes from Uncle Zef's and take them inside. How'd you sleep? Good. You? You're all up? Yeah. Has Mark left? He's getting ready. ln front of the mirror again? - What's your problem? - You're like a girl. Watch it. Staring at himself... ls that what you're wearing? What's wrong with it? Look. Roll down your sleeves. - Leave them alone. hey're fine. - Roll them down. Just leave them. hey're fine. Unzip it. Just leave me alone. l know how to dress. You crazy? Do whatever you want. Leave me alone. l'm just saying it looks ridiculous. Breakfast is on the table. - Roll your sleeves down. - Go away. Wake up the little ones. l need to get ready for work. Dren, wake up. Bora, time for school. Come on, get up. Dad, can l have 200 lek? l need a new notebook. You go right through them. But it's for school. Rudina, here you go. hank you. Dren, finish your milk. - l don't want any more. - Finish it. We need to move the cement up to the roof. For the back wall? We'll do it tomorrow. l'm off to work. Bye. - Bora, where's your backpack? - By the TV. Go get it. And get Dren's too. Hurry up, Dren. What are you doing? No electricity? Nope. Director! - he keys. - hanks. Did you see her smiling? Yeah, she was smiling. She was, right? Hang on. Again? Let's go. You're crazy. Four or five computers and l'm set. lt'll be awesome. Yeah, right. Where you gonna get the money? Clear out, guys. We've got work to do. Move it. But we were here first. Come on. Let's go. Clear out. Move. l swear, it happened so many times. He came and grabbed my paper from behind. He wouldn't let go. Rudina, come on. l'll give you a ride. l'm going. How was school? Giddyap! Good. he teacher gave us a quiz. l had to talk about sponges. he thing is, people thought they were plants. But they have, like, fins -- Fins? Yeah, like, fins they use to beat the water, and they take all the water and all the bacteria, and it goes in this, like, cavity, and they feed off it, but sometimes stuff gets stuck inside and can't get out. l mean, it gets out eventually. l'm not sure how, but it's really neat. - What did your teacher give you? - A ten. Dad... Mira and lrena are going to Shkodra Saturday to buy shoes. And? Please, l need new shoes. l'll go with you. What do you know about girls' shoes? l know plenty. Pass me two corn breads. - How are you, Mark? - l'm fine. hank you. Hi, Rudina. How are you? - Your new passport? - Yes, l got it. But the photo is terrible. Let me see. No, Mark. Let me see. l was afraid l'd close my eyes. Just like in our class photo. Did you and Sokol get into it again? With all due respect, your cousin is an idiot. he two of you are ridiculous. He's ridiculous. Of course, you're the sane one. Forget about it. lt's not worth it. See you. Bye, Rudina. Bye. - What's this? - lt's good, right? For Facebook? l gotta upload it. Let me sign in. Come on, even this one? - Why not? - You're crazy. You can't post that. lt wasn't easy, believe me. he girls will go nuts. Here you go. ake my bag for me. - Where are you going? - l'll see you later. Tying your shoes here again? Can l help it if they come untied here? Sure, of course not. Where are you going? You going to Suadi's party? lt's his last. He's off to London. What's up with Suadi going to London? Like you wouldn't want to go to London? What for? o lug bricks around? Maybe you'd get some muscles. So you wanna go to London too now? No, l'm going to university. Your parents won't even let you go to a party, never mind university. What's a party got to do with university? Anyway, they know what l'm like. And what are you like? What does that mean? Nothing. l'm kidding. You're always kidding. Who was that? None of your business. Who was it? - My sister. - Let me see your phone. You don't believe me? - Can l have your number? - What do you need it for? - You know my number? - l don't want it. Come on. Give me your phone a sec. Why should l give you my phone? Just let me see it a second. - hat your number? - Yeah. You have money on your phone? - Why? What are you doing? - Come on, relax. - You're terrible. You suck. Bardha... Son of a... What the hell? What the hell, what? What are you doing? l had to close the road. What for? l have to keep my chickens in. You expect me to go all the way around? he other way? Do whatever you want. lt's not my problem. l have to get through this road. Enough is enough. he state gave us this land because we worked it. When my grandfather had this land, our family always let the town use this road. Your family had a tradition of bending over. Don't talk about my family with your dirty mouth. hen don't go around calling us thieves. You can't close this road. Who's gonna stop me? You? Go ahead and try. Let's see what you can do. You don't have the balls. Get back in the cart. Now! his is the last time you speak like that in front of my daughter, understand? ake that ugly cart and get out of here. You feel tough holding that thing? lf it wasn't for my daughter, l'd put you in your place. So come back without her. Feed Klinsmann. l have to talk to your uncle. Zef! Stay. - What did she say? - lt's not what she said. Just tell me what she said. She didn't have to say anything. lt was what she was thinking. So what was she thinking? Well, she didn't reject me, so -- She didn't reject you. Not bad. Pass me that wrench. his one? he other one. Pass me the shock. hese things are completely shot. l already talked to Fredi. l'm getting the Kawasaki ones. For this thing? You should just buy a new bike. Lift it up. Lift it. A little more. - Nik, where have you been? - What's up? We've been looking for you. - What's going on? - Come with us. - Wait, l'm just -- - Come on. his can't wait. Where are you going? Quick. Move. - What's going on? - Just get in and we'll tell you. Get your head down. What's going on? Get inside, quick. hank you. - Did they tell you? -Yeah. How did it happen? Sokol blocked the road and got into a fight with Dad. Dad told Uncle Zef, and they went back. And stabbed him? hey arrested Uncle Zef. Hey, boy! Come here. Do you know where your father is? No. When was the last time you saw him? his morning. ell me about the fight he got into with Sokol at the pub. He doesn't know anything. Who started the fight? Listen... he'd be safer in custody than he is in hiding. We don't know where he is. Let's go. As if we didn't know Sokol's cousin is a police officer. Have you heard from Dad? Adrian Pragami saw him running across his field afterwards. He's probably headed for Rragam. We've tried calling. His phone is off. For the moment, you might not owe his family any blood at all. But you know that's not the way they see it. By the Kanun, your family must stay in isolation. But Sokol did you wrong with your road and your land. So we have to know what happened: who attacked whom, what started it. Maybe he stabbed himself as he tumbled to the ground. Even if my sons are partly to blame, Sokol blocked the road. He cut off my son's livelihood. So there should be no blood debt. Ded, the Kanun says to protect your land. Remember what happened to Kujtim Sula? What happened? Somebody broke into his house. He tried to defend it with a gun and ended up shooting the boy. Even then, Kujtim spent five years in isolation just for trying to protect his home. But here they don't know what they're defending. They believe it's their land to protect. l wish Dad would send a message already. lt could be dangerous. So how many people are we sending? hree people to ask for a besa. We need to send the right people. lf they grant the besa, how many go to the funeral? Twenty. l want to go too if they give us a besa. You're too young. l'm old enough to be targeted. l should represent my father. Out of the question. Get back inside! What do you think you're doing? Nothing. l just wanted to see. What the hell are you thinking? You don't set foot outside, understand? From now on, we all stay inside. Out of respect for their loss. Dren as well. - Dren's just a child. - lt doesn't matter! lt's too risky. You're gonna use up all the minutes. Hello, Shpend. How are you? Everything okay? Fine. - What's this? - My wife prepared these for you. hat's very kind of her. Thank you. How are you? Mark sent a text message to let you know he's safe. lt was from an anonymous number. Rudina. Your grandfather and l have decided that starting tomorrow, you'll do the bread route. - Me? - Yes, you. Why? We need to do something. We can't survive like this. As it is, my foreman will fire me if l don't get back. Just 'cause she's a girl? Nik, you need to help her. What about school? And your brothers? How would they feel if you went while they couldn't? For how long? Until your father comes back. When is that going to be? Always put the chain on this side so you don't hurt him. ry it. No, the way l told you. Like this. And always on the fourth link. Understand? Yes. You have to tie this here. Twice. Tight. Understand? Show me. Don't be so nervous. He's not going to do anything. Good. Tight. Again, tight. Good. Shh! Klinsmann. Rudina. Nik. What? - l'm hungry. - Ask Bora. - l don't know what to make. - Whatever Rudina makes. - l'm hungry! - Enough! Rudina... l already got my bread. From who? Kristjan Lukaj. He's been bringing it from Shkodra. But you always get it from us. What can l tell you? l can't buy bread l don't need. Can't you just buy your usual order? What would l do with it? What about tomorrow? Tomorrow... get here before Kristjan and l'll take your bread. Okay? Rudina. Wait a moment. l have to get going. Take this. Thank you. No, Klinsmann. Not here. Let's go. How am l supposed to kill him? You have to be faster. l'm trying, but he's too fast. You shouldn't play if you don't know how. You think you're the only one who can play? l know how to play. Go, Bora. Hey. What's up? What's this? What have you done here? Some modifications. Check it out. This is new? What did you do? lt's crooked! You got the shocks. What do you think? Where'd you get the money? Enough, enough. Over here. l can't go out there. What's happening? There was a party at Klodi's. - How was it? - Good. We had fun. - What was it for? - His 1 8th birthday. The whole class went. - Everyone? The whole senior class. Everyone? Yeah. Did you get drunk? Yeah, what do you think? - Was Bardha there? - She was there. But Klodi, l don't know -- Why? What happened? We were all dancing, and he kept making her laugh. Klodi? Are you kidding? l'm just saying. You better do something. Write some love poems or something. What do you do all day? Think. lf you keep sitting on your ass, you'll end up looking like my uncle. You all right? l'm fine. At first l couldn't believe it was true, but now -- They'll figure something out eventually. Yeah, but how long is eventually? You remember that kid in fourth grade who had to stay in isolation? Jetmir Malaj. He was stuck in his house for, like, six years. Yeah, but they got some mediator, and they settled it. Eventually they always mediate. All they do is sit and talk about the Kanun. Ndue Binaku's cousin asked me to deliver lime to his new house. - And you did it? - Yeah. - How much did he pay you? - Three thousand. You shouldn't do something like that for less than 5,000. l was already going in that direction. lt doesn't matter. What was l supposed to do? Rudina, where's the cell phone? l bought more minutes. l'll do it. Where'd you put the phone? - Over there. Did you find someplace safe? lt's best you don't know where l am. What about the police? They've been by twice. Are you okay? Well enough. My eyes are acting up. l need my drops. Has Sokol's family tried anything? They refuse to listen to us. They didn't give us a besa for the funeral. They say they were doubly insulted because you and Uncle Zef came onto their land. We went to talk to him. We didn't do anything. We were unarmed. He welcomed us with his knife. He attacked you? He jumped on us like a crazy dog. Mark... your soup is getting cold. Do we have any cigarettes? Did Dritan bring the gun? l sent word for him to bring it. You need to keep it loaded... or there's no point having it. Did Sokol do that to you? Now load it. Have you come across any of them? No. Make sure you don't provoke them. lf you see them on the street, avoid them. Kristjan Lukaj has been bringing in bread from Shkodra. But... l start earlier now. The time. The light. Good-bye. Bread. Thanks. How are you? Fine. And you? Good. Here's your money. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Good morning. Four packs of cigarettes. The same kind as always. - Thank you. - Have a good day. You sell a lot of cigarettes? Depends on the people. But... how much does a carton cost? Fifteen thousand, twenty thousand, depending on the brand. And how much do you make? Why do you want to know? lf l buy three cartons, can l pay you at the end of the week? l work with money, Rudina. l give credit all the time. You're going to sell cigarettes? A girl like you shouldn't even be selling bread. l'll give you the money in a few days. Thursday you'll pay me. But... since l'm getting three cartons, l need a discount. That's how it works. - Hey. - You're here? Of course l'm here. You thought l'd chicken out? You're crazy. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? l can't believe l made it. Did you have trouble getting out? No, it was easy. lt was weird how easy it was. What do you do all day? l don't know. Watch TV... think of you. Shut up. l heard there was a party for Klodi's birthday. Yeah. lt was boring. l heard you were laughing at his jokes. - l was not. -That's not what l heard. You heard wrong. - Really? - Yes. Did you miss me? Do you really think they would try something? My grandfather says they'd be happy if they shot me or Dren. He's just a little boy. They know it would hurt my family more than anything. My uncle has only daughters. Anyway, they're happy to see us suffer. They won't let it end. lt's so stupid. l hate Sokol Bala. l shouldn't talk badly about the dead, but if it wasn't for him -- Sokol Bala, your father... your uncle -- My father was just defending himself. Sokol insulted him. The slightest insult and they go crazy. They all act like children. l told Fatjana l was going to meet you. What? Why? Don't worry. - What if she tells someone? - She won't tell anyone. Why did you tell her? l don't know. l just had to tell someone. She said l was stupid for seeing you. Who knows how long you'll be in the feud. You agree with her? Wash your hands. Put it in and pack it down. Hold it. Hold it straight. What's this? We made weights! Nik. - Why did you do this here? - What? Why did you do this here? What's the big deal? You expect me to clean up after you? l'm not cleaning it up. Who asked you to? What do you do all day? Stop yelling. lt's not a big deal. Nik! Get down! Dren! Why should they shoot at you? You've stayed inside. You've been respectful. Zef got 1 8 years. They should be satisfied. Now's the time to send someone to talk to them. What about Samet Leka? Why should they listen to Samet? He does business with their family. That was years ago. lt's not the right time to send someone. Clearly their blood is still hot. What about the person who mediated for Enver Malaj's family? l used to go to school with his son, Jetmir. Who mediated for Enver Malaj? lt was their flagsman. No, they used Hasan Pema. Who is Hasan Pema? He's from Shkodra. He's done a lot of mediations. We'll deal with it ourselves. But we need someone with experience. We have plenty of experience. But we've never done this before. You can't just send some stranger to their door. You have to send the right person with a group of elders whom they know and respect. You wait for the right moment to go. They say no. Then you wait and go again. That's just how it works. An outsider would be neutral. They might respect someone who's mediated before. No. We'll solve our own problems. How many still owe on credit? Only six. Good. That's good. Thank you. Here you go. Thank you. You always give me ones that are still warm. l pull them from the bottom of the pile. Just like your father. How is he? l haven't seen him. On top of everything else, you're without your father. You should know not all my family is of the same mind. My uncle understands there's enough blame to go around. lt's my cousins who keep on about your father. They insist he should be in jail before they'll consider mediation. But -- l know, l know. lt's so stupid. Come on. We did this last week. Dren... start working and show me what we learned last week. Come on. Dren, answer me. What are you doing? Sit up properly. Pick up the pencil. Are you listening? Start. - l don't want to. Listen to your teacher. Where are you going? Come back here! What are you doing? Get back over there. Give me that. Give me the controller. - lt's mine. lt's my game. - Give it to me. Dren! Come here! Dren, come out! Dren. You hear me? Don't be a baby. Mr. Skendaj's waiting. Dren! Fine. Don't come out. See if l care. Dren... you remember the story Dad used to tell us about the little boy and the giant? Remember what the little boy did? Remember how he was? That's how you have to be. Understand? You have to be strong. Turn back. Don't cross my path with that cart. Turn back! Stay in your village with that thing. Got it? Go! Go, Klinsmann. - Nice to meet you. - Welcome. - Hasan Pema. - Thank you for coming. - Hello. - How are you? Nik Lindani. - Hasan Pema. - Thank you for coming. Good to be here. You're Nik? - Yes. How are you? Ded Lindani. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. By the Kanun, they should not threaten a girl or kill her for revenge. Either they don't know the Kanun or they're twisting it. The Kanun respects him who forgives more than him who kills. When Nik's friend told me about the situation you're in and his sister being threatened, my organization felt obliged to do something. My heart hurts to hear of your troubles. You need someone with experience. Over the past 1 5 years l've mediated 47 feuds. lf you entrust this case to me, l promise to work hard until blood is forgiven. How long will it take? Peace must have strong roots so that it cannot be easily destroyed. Of course... all of this work comes with certain expenses. The telephone... gas... certain gifts. Their wound is still bleeding. The Kanun calls for the payment of six sacks of gold at the closure of a feud. We already know what the Kanun says. Reading the Kanun and applying it are two different things. But my uncle's in jail. He's already paying for the crime. But your father is still free. He didn't do anything. Didn't do anything? Holding Sokol while Zef stabbed him? You saw what happened? l've done my homework. You mean you've been gossiping. They don't care what's right. All they want is blood. That's why l'm here. You need someone with experience to represent you. We know what happened, and we're very sorry. lt's Sokol's actions that bring us here. He came out with a knife to stab them in their backs. They did nothing but defend themselves. You can't condemn a murder and defend it at the same time. You're calling us murderers and hypocrites? As l said, we appreciate your coming to visit. Of course, our door is always open to you. Give me some of the white ones. Hurry up. Use the blue ones. Who is it? NO MEDlATOR CAN SAVE YOU. You made it. What's this? Barbie! Dren, what's wrong? Dren. Come here. He's tired. Are you tired? You forget how to talk? He hasn't been feeling well. What happened? He wants to go to school. ls the school still sending his teacher? ls Mr. Skendaj coming to give you lessons? Dren and Bora should be in school. You think l don't know that? l thought we could get a besa for them to go back to school. A besa? They don't need a besa. They're children. By the Kanun they shouldn't even be targeted. Then why are they staying home? lf we accept a besa, they can take it away whenever they want. We'd be at their mercy. Have you thought about that? What makes you even think they'd give us a besa? We don't know if we don't try. So you bring in someone from outside? Do you know what he's telling their family? How do you know he's not making things worse? You think his kind cares about resolving this? What's he going to live on if feuds are resolved? Use your head. Then let's ask Mr. Skendaj. To do what? - To ask for a besa. - He's right. He teaches Sokol's children too. They might listen to him. She should have had a proper birthday. Then you shouldn't have picked a fight with Dad. He shouldn't have picked a fight with me. Why does he even bother to come visit? How can you say that? lt just makes everything worse. - lt's not his fault! - Whose fault is it, then? Not here. Over there. More on this side. Wait. Bora! Let Tom in. Hey, Nik. What's with all the bricks? l got something. What? What's that? - Check it out. - What's this? My uncle in Toronto sent me money for it. Look at the video. The class. Hey, Nik! lt's me. How are you? ls this recording? Tom got a new phone. Come back. We miss you. Go to the next clip. Ready? - For what? - Look. Hey, Nik. How are you? Everything's still the same. Nothing new. We had literature class. l have to do the homework. lt's easy. Did Tom tell you Arben and Lindita broke up? You know what Arben's like. What else? l'm sorry l haven't written, but you know how it is. We miss you. Everybody asks about you. Even teachers ask about you. I'm sorry you have to stay home. l hope things get better. That's all for now. Bye. How do l play it again? - Oh, God -- - Once more! - How do l look? - Fine. Just start. Hi, Bardha. How are you? ls everything okay? Where are you now, in school or -- Why are you asking questions? Bardha, this is my gym. My bars. l put boards up. Here too. l'm going to close this up. Thanks for sending the video. l was happy to see you. l miss all of you too. Seems like you're having a good time. l can't wait to see you again. Bye. Enough. Walk straight to school. Keep a close eye on Dren. Don't let him out of your sight. When you're done, come straight home. Don't forget to thank Mr. Skendaj. Bye. And then my machine jammed, and the foreman took it out on me. He was yelling at you in ltalian? No, that's the owner. The foreman is from Postribe. - How are you? - Hi. How's it going? Can l have a pack of Marlboros? You have any without the tax stamp? - The tax stamp? How are you? Good? Fine. l heard the police were questioning Shpend about Mark. Shpend? Why were they questioning Shpend? Don't worry. l'm sure it's nothing. Don't worry about it. Have a good day. Bye. Nik! Put your head down. What did you do to the wall? Are you crazy? - lt's a wall. What's your problem? - What are you talking about? Go complain to Dad! What did you do to the wall? Leave me alone. l can do what l want. - Get down! l don't want to! Come down! l don't want to! - l told you to get down! - What's your problem? What are you doing? Put down that knife! Get out of here! Stop it! What's going on here? Give me the knife. Give me the knife, Nik! He's messed up everything! Out! Out! Clean up. Go! Take the kids and get out. Out! Out! Go, Klinsmann. Move. Do you have Marlboros without the tax stamp? The ones from Montenegro? No, l don't. You know where l can find them? Try over there. Excuse me. Do you have Marlboros without the tax stamp? No, l don't have any. l need five cartons. l don't have that many. You know where l can get them? Try the man over there. He doesn't have them. Leave me alone. l've got things to do. Can l buy the ones you have? No. Now go on. ls Dren asleep? Yeah. Did you hear that? Get water! Rudina, quick! Rudina, quick! Water! Quick! Nik, don't get close! Don't get so close! Water! Quickly! Go inside, go inside. You shouldn't have come. Someone could be watching... just waiting for you to show up. We have to think about how to respond. We can't even begin to negotiate as long as you're still free. Mara said as much to Rudina. You're talking to Mara about me? She brought it up. Go to the police. lf you're innocent, they'll set you free, and Sokol's family will see it. lf l'm innocent? Sokol's cousin is a cop. You think they'll treat me fairly? At least in prison you'd be safe. And we could begin to talk to them. You want to trade your father away? ls that what you want? We can't live like this just because you and Zef -- You can't live like this? How do you think it is for me? You think l like living in hiding? Away from my family? So turn yourself in. For yourself, for us. You want to be free, whatever the cost. You've forgotten that this whole thing started because l was defending this family. By holding Sokol down while Uncle Zef -- l was trying to save my brother's life! You're ready to sell me out... just like that. ls it that easy? Don't move! Don't move! Hands up! Police! Police! Get down! On the ground! Get down! Hold him! Hands behind your back! Stay down! Get him up! Up! Let's go! Move! Nik. l wasn't sure which one. Those will do. What are you waiting for? Go get ready. Nik... you finally get a besa, and now you want to stay in the house? What will l tell your father when he asks why you didn't come visit? We have to do something for him -- l can't go there. l expect you to work on the stable. See if Dren and Bora are ready. How's your father? Have you seen him? No. We need money for a lawyer. You have to take advantage of your besa. That's why l'm here, Mara. We can't rely on just a besa. lf you could go and talk to them -- lt's too early. You just got the besa. We need to do something. lt's not a woman's business. lt's a man's job. Women's opinions don't count. My father's in prison. What more do they expect -- for me to shoot him? lt's not that, but -- What about Valmir threatening my sister? He's a bad influence in our family. He's caused a lot of problems. That's why l'm saying... if you could go... to talk with your uncle -- Maybe by Christmas he might be willing to receive someone. Maybe we can do something then. - This Christmas? - Yes. Stay, Klinsmann. Does he kick? No, he doesn't kick. He just doesn't know you, and there are other horses, so he's nervous. His legs are crooked. He has two bumps over his eyes. Means he scares easy. But he's a strong horse. And he's a hard worker. l'll give you 200,000. No, 400. Four hundred? lt's not a female. Only a female's worth 400,000. Two fifty. Three hundred and -- three fifty. We'll leave it at 300,000. Three hundred thousand. Three twenty. He's a very good horse. l'm not lowering my price. - Hey, turn left. - Why? Just do it. You'll see. What do you think? l don't know. l'll be right back. - Hey. - Nik. Did you hear? - Yeah, they gave you a besa. - Yeah, two weeks. That's it? We asked for a month, but that's all they gave us. Anyway, l'm happy for you. l wanted to see you, but l wasn't sure if -- Nik. Anyway, l just wanted to say hi. Well, enjoy your freedom. - See you. - Bye. What did she say? Nothing. Let's do something. Come inside. You're out of jail? ls this how you welcome me? Why didn't you visit me? You got a besa. How have you used it? Do they know you got out? Nik, they took away the besa. What? The besa isn't important. What are you saying? There will be others. The only way to mediate was if you were in jail. You want me to stay in jail? - What are we gonna -- - Stop! We're both inside now? When you were in jail, we had a chance, but now -- l've done everything l can to respect your loss. My life is in your hands. lf you want to kill me, l'm right here. So kill me now, or let us go free. What are you doing here? Are you trying to provoke my grandfather? l've come to end this feud. You bribed your father's way out of jail. How much will you pay to end this feud? Your father's freedom is an insult. Being trapped inside isn't freedom. Good, because you'll be inside your entire life. Now go home. Go home where you belong. Hear me? Not here! Not on our land! lt would be shameful on our land! Get up. l've listened to you. Now you listen to me. l wake up every morning with tears in my eyes for my son. This feud pains us as much as it does you. Your father is out of jail, and if he ever steps out of his house, he's dead. You say you respect me, but you come here with ultimatums. You come here with great courage, but you're still young, just a kid. You want to be free. Okay. But you, and only you. You have 24 hours to say good-bye to your family. After that, don't ever come back. lf you go, we won't come after you. But if you return, we'll bury you next to my son. Now go. Take him. Where will he go? Where's he going to stay? lf he leaves, he'll never come back. Eventually we'll reconcile, and then he'll return. lf he leaves, it's the same as giving them blood. l'm going to lose my son. You want to give them that? lt's better than him being stuck here. Nik... you have to go. Speak. Why aren't you saying anything? What do you want me to say? You always say you're protecting this family, and now you're not saying a word. He should go. My heart doesn't want it. But it's his choice. Not mine. What about you? What about me? What are you going to do? l don't know. l'll figure something out. l'll be fine.
