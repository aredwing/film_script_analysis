There sits the most loveable person in the whole world to me... ... who I never knew any better than the day we first met... The person, who could light a fire in me and put it out... ... who knew, but didn't want to believe... I said to you... either-or... you cried... because of me or because of you not 'cause I love you so much... and that's what you should have cried for... What are you doing? You want to help me? - Yes... I'll give each of you a euro... ... and you shout ''Sonja'' until she comes to the balcony... Which Sonja? - Well, my girlfriend... Why? - Just do it, man! Sonja! Sonja! What's going on out there? Nothing... Sonja, I love you. Come back. Was that Anton? Where are you going? I'm getting the laundry... Well, I don't want to interfere, but you could be a bit nicer to him... Such a sweet boy... Why don't you go out with him, then... It's not getting any easier with you... Sonja... - Yeah... I've been thinking about the summer house... I don't think it's a good idea... Why that, now...? I don't want you to go, understand? - Great... You're already going to the sports-camp... - And? I just don't like the idea... I can't go because you don't like it? It's not my problem that you can't stand him anymore... Why were you with him then? Stop it, now... you know nothing about that... And Anton? - Anton... I already promised Julia we're going together... Julia, Julia, Julia... I can't hear that name anymore... Give it back, it's mine. I don't trust him, you understand...? Hi, I'm here... - I'm coming. Where are you going? - Away. Sonja, dinner's almost ready... Mum... don't forget... It's not my fault he's my father... God, my mother makes me sick... What happened...? Same as usual... Just forget about her... you're with me now... Come on baby, get on... Sexy ass! Come on Paul. And the question of the day is... Will you find the love of your life this summer? What are you dying to do this summer? a) I want to truly fall in love. b) I don't want to come back home a virgin. c) I'll just let everything happen as it happens... I want to fall in love, fall in love, fall in love... I thought you are in love... But you do have a boyfriend... Well, yes... but, he just always wants to fuck... And have you already...? Yeah, of course... haven't you? I thought we've all already? Sonja? Yes, sure... - With Anton? Well, I'll only sleep with a man, when I'm married to him... Hey... no, I really mean it... - Miss morals... - A bit old-fashioned, isn't it? I don't even know what to do ''there''... What do you mean? I don't even know to move or how to start at all... Well, you have to move a bit, too... In a rhythm...? It'd be weird if he has to pump away on his own... And the best thing you can do is... You lay down on the floor with your legs on the sofa... It's heavenly... You've done that? - Of course... Did you come? - Of course I did... And what does it feel like? When you come? Good... warm... oh... why? Well... I thought you just notice it... It's like an explosion in your body... So, does it tickle...? Yeah, totally. And it doesn't stop... I'll be the last virgin in the world... No... everybody does it at some point... Yeah, but maybe not me... Okay, next subject... ''The first kiss with your sweetheart... What should it be like...?'' Emotional and very wet? Wild and passionate? Those guys were really hot... On a scale of 1 to 10 he's definitely a 7... More like 6... where are you going? I'm going to go play a little bit... Are we going, too? - Of course we are... You coming, too? We'll be there in a minute... Shall we go...? I'd like to talk to you... Later... Sonja, will you get that...? You get it... Sonja... Hello... come in... Sonja! Maybe she'll be nicer to you... Oh, is she really grumpy...? Sonja... you've got a visitor... Come in... Hey... - Hey... I brought you flowers... Thanks... Care for a drive ''in the wild''...? Yes... Yeah? Then come on... Bye mum... You're leaving? I thought we'll drink a coffee together? It's running good again, no? Dad and I fixed it. It was just the battery, not the lights, like I first thought... I thought that I could make a hole here... for a sunroof... ... that'd be cool in the summer, no? Oh... Mum said you can come for dinner again, if you feel like it... Are you listening to me? Yes... Can you stop the car please...? Stop? How can I stop here? There's no where to pull off... Just stop the car! Hey... calm down... Hey, what's the matter...? Nothing... Forget about dinner... I'm going to sports camp tomorrow... Leave me alone... You're suffocating me! For heaven's sake... what happened? May I ask you for a dance with my ''freshly dried'' hand? Where would you like to go now? To you, my lord... - To me? Yes, but sadly I must go now... Will we meet again? You're really pretty, do you know that? Did you know that you are really beautiful... No, no Senor... that's what you say to every woman... No darling... you are the most beautiful. Do you remember when l...? Don't move... ... I told you, that I wanted to talk to you... Well, I had this dream one night... What kind of dream? I dreamt, that l... What? Well, it's just... uh, it was a stupid dream... Pretty..? Now we are the prettiest... Hi... - Hi... Wanna' go in?... Please... That one's so cute... Come on... Oh God... Can I try...? Yes, of course... - Hello... Well, how's it going...? - I'm fine... and you? Now that you're here, I'm fine too... You're up late... Hello... I thought it's bedtime for small boys... And what're you doing tonight? - Naughty... I don't know yet. What about you? Maybe there's something nice to do? Well, maybe we can meet this evening? Yes, I'd like to... So, let's go! Bedtime...! Oh no... - See you tomorrow... Guys... you coming? - Come on... You can come to our room if you want? Please... No... Come on... Hey... Stop it man... Hey, cut it out... Hey! Sonja...? Sonja... Hey, are you asleep? Are you still awake? Hey, can you hear me? Can I come to you? That guy was so stupid... I just wanted to be with you... I'm your 'silky paw ', aren't l? Your... Little lion's tooth... Do you want to draw on my back? Marika took the pictures... after the concert. They're good, right? We thought we'd never get autographs, 'cause there were so many girls in the line... But it worked out in the end... It was great... What kind of concert was it, then? I just told you... Thanks for listening to me. They were the free tickets from the sports club. They thought we were crazy 'cause we wanted the autographs on our arms... But they did it... In the end they even took us for a ride on their bus. And why are you sitting there without underpants? What do you mean ''no underpants''? Well just like I said... Just with t-shirt? We have shorts on... Really!... you understand nothing... You make me sick... Please don't... I don't want to... Why not...? What's the matter...? What's wrong? I'm afraid I'll get pregnant... Come on... lf you close your eyes and open them again... You'll see... the man of your dreams... Close your eyes... Now lie down... So? Who do you see? You! How was it with Anton, yesterday? Tell me... or I'll tickle it out of you. Don't you dare... You know where I feel it when you laugh? Everything was nice and nothing hurt... The sun circled around her pussy... Remember when I wanted to tell you about my dream...? I dreamt I kissed you on the neck... Is that bad? We'lI come, then... Julia and l... Julia, my best friend... Exactly, her. Yeah, just a second... Mom, you want to? She can't come right now... Yes, see you soon... I'm going to see my father... With Julia... Anton, I've been thinking about us... I'm sorry... Has anyone ever told you, you look good in braids? Imagine... They really look good. I like you so much... I wrote you something... What...? But no laughing and no peeking... What are you doing inside? It's still light out... Ah... She makes me sick... that woman really pisses me off... Your mum didn't come home alone, did she...? No... with the new one... With ''the new one'' ? She has anew boyfriend... they met in the elevator... You think your mom's in love? Yeah, guess so. I thought you wanted to read me something...? The wind plays a melody... Smile, greet the world laughing. Lift your thick eyebrows, the ones I said were hypnotic... Open your mouth and talk... The rain is singing, run... Innocence on your face, arms swaying... The muscles in your legs are swinging. You breathe faster... your heart sparkles in your eyes... ... and pours out of you ... pain, happiness. Into the rain... You feel this burning taste on your tongue... But you'd like to, want to. You are thirsty for more... I'm tired... I'd like to sleep... Julia...? Can I come to you? See you tomorrow... I have to tell you something... I've got a date with that guy in the red cap. We met him on the street, remember? Wish me luck... Good luck... See you tomorrow... - See you tomorrow... Can I talk to you about something...? It's about Anton... What? He's so boring... What do you mean, boring...? I don't know... He only talks about his car and... Are you listening to me at all? Of course... I'm just cooking for 'Madam', if that's permitted. I'm gonna' dump him... I don't like him anymore. What do you like then? Girls or what? Do you really think I don't know what's going on? What's going on? Have you lost it or what? How dare you talk to me like that! How dare you! You're not interested in anything! Interested in what? It's all in your diary! You read my diary! God damn it! I'm moving out! Fucking A... You'll never see me again! Do you have your bathing suit? Aha... a big silence is all I get, right? All right... Where is she? Hey, where are you... What? Have fun... see you... bye. Has something happened? Nothing happened... Julia isn't a virgin anymore... - What? Nothing. I have to go now. Sonja... here... Bye... Come on... higher... Harry, take it... Good... halftime... Higher... both hands... Good... Higher... Higher, both hands, both hands... Hello... You've really grown up... The last time I saw you, you were so little... Remember? You were shocked when you saw me... You ran into the street, crying, and your dad ran after you... Sonja... You want to go to the beach...? Well, that one sucked... Oh... right into the wave... Wow... did you see that one? - No, sorry... Hey Harry... Who's that? - Oh, that's our neighbour... Is he nice? Hey, is he nice? - Well, it depends... Do you want a ride to the summer house? No thanks... I'll walk... - You sure? Okay... Bye. Bye... Eat properly... ... use the spoon... Are you deaf?. Oh, I forgot the wine... Something wrong? - No... nothing... Why'd you always talk to me about equal rights? I don't understand... Even though I'm a girl, you allowed me to learn everything... What do you mean...? I think it's clear. A man is a man and a woman is a woman... Thanks... I'm not hungry anymore. Can I use your cell-phone? My card's empty... Ask dad... Look Sonja... sometimes your father is like a little child... I think you know that, don't you? Dad... can I borrow your cell phone? Yes, of course... This is my daughter Sonja... This is our neighbour Michel... Thanks... Hi... I can't answer the phone right now, please try again later. Bye! My God... it should be somewhere here... My God... it should be somewhere here... Hurry up or we'll never get there... Take your hands out of your pockets! Just look at yourself! By the way you're slouched, I can tell you what kind of man you'll be! Can you cut it out. What? Criticizing him all the time! That's not criticism, that's education... Education? Where you live, you can see those uneducated children... I can tell how they're going to be... Small-time criminals... Come on now... This is like trying to get snails to run... I'll go find some buddies... See you in a minute... Maybe you can meet some nice youngsters here...? She doesn't look bad, no? - Ask her... Why? - You don't have the guts... So what? - Come on... do it... Okay. Watch this... I've got a question... You have a light? - No she doesn't smoke. Hey, I'm not talking to you! What's the matter? - Stupid cunt! Forget her... She looks good, but she's got no brains... I'll be right back... Come on Harry, let's go... Wait a second... We want to get to know you... He's talking to you... Hey, where do you want to go? You can't just leave! Hey... at least give me your number... So, did you meet any kids from the village? - No... And dad? - He's hanging out with some people... Oh... who? - I don't know... Sonja... Our neighbour was here again... He borrowed the key for the boat... Such a handsome man... Hey... - Hi... You couldn't sleep, either? And now...? Come on... I'll show you something... And...? It's beautiful... You want a cigarette? Thanks, I don't smoke... My boyfriend smokes... He always tastes like an ashtray after... Well, I guess I don't have a chance then... Never a chance with you... I knew you'd come... You're a very beautiful woman... I'm not a woman, I'm still a girl. Kiss me... Or don't you want to...? I'm still a virgin... But I thought you were... you have...? You all look so grown up nowadays... Sonja... I can't do this... I want it... And I want you to do it... Are you really sure...? Oh, you little one... I don't want to hurt you... You don't have to be afraid, okay? So, Madam is already back... Nice sweater you've got on... Mr. mystery can adorn himself with new plumes now... Well, I hope it was worth it... Hey... I've been looking for you... My address... I can't give you my telephone number... I think you know why...? Sonja... Leave me alone... Go... Sonja... The bus is coming... Well, bye then... It was nice... say 'hi' to everyone at home... Here... I have a present for you... but open it on the bus... Sonja... Julia! I'm sorry... I got caught in traffic... I missed you so much... - Me too... Don't ever leave me alone so long again. Well, you could have come with me... How was it? - Well... No...? Well, nothing happened here without you... Hey, where are the moped helmets? The moped helmets? - Well, those... helmets... I know what you mean... I don't have them with me... - Why not? That's a surprise... - What kind of surprise? You'll see in a minute... Hey honey... - Hi... Eldin, my boyfriend... Sonja, my best friend... Shall we go? Just a minute, honey... He's cute, isn't he? Is everything all right? Has something happened? Nothing's happened. Nothing special... We went out the other night, to this club we always pass by... They played the number one song... I don't remember the name now... Anyway, we went dancing and he kept stepping on my feet... Not true... It's not true... Well, Marika came and said ''Hey, you dance so nice and blah... '' And she said something about a wedding dance... And when is the wedding? Next week? Yeah, next week... my mum won't come... That was nice honey. Let's do it again. Yes, we have to... And we will... But next time we'll make sure that Marika isn't there... Stop the car please... Are you sick...? No, everything's fine... Are you okay? Sonja? What's the matter? - Nothing... Sonja... Wait... What's going on? Hey, what's the matter? - Nothing... Just leave me... I want to be alone... Why alone...? I missed you so much... I missed you too... Julia, I can't do this... I know we wanted to stay friends... ... but I love you so much... But, I love you too... Yes, but I love you so... Do you understand? I really love you. I can't do it Sonja, I can't...
