Only one boy was born amidst 30 girls. Wow! This naked boy looks so smart! He looks just like me! ln fact this baby is me! Prem! Yes! The sole hero of this story! This was my first eye contact with girls. Let it be. My affair with that nurse didn't get anywhere. People fail in love and they become drunkards. But l started drinking milk. And then l started growing up in a big joint family. We were 7 siblings in our family. Their only brother. ls this dress nice? My childhood was surrounded with two things. Toys.. and children.. l mean girls. An average child in his childhood thinks that.. ..he will become an engineer, doctor.. ..or cricketer when he grows up. But in my case, God's plan was something different. Because of my upbringing, l started understanding.. ..all kind of girls' feelings. And l started helping those unfortunate boys.. ..whom no girl ever glanced at. And gradually l became love guru. These girls! Very blind! Do you know? 99% girls get the guy of their choice! But 99% guys don't find the girl of their choice. Their love ends before it could even begin. And my work begins here. Love guru! l.. What's the name of the girl? l don't know! Does it really matter? lt matters to me! Actually she too.. Loves you. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah! But she too.. She too stammers like you? No, no! Oh! She feels shy! Yes! Look, your situation is very good! You begin the matter and she will end it. My ignorant heart, what has happened to me? What is the antidote of this pain? What's your problem? ln the entire universe, amongst so many beautiful faces.. ..l locked eyes with such a girl.. ..that my life has become radiant. Good morning, uncle. This is my first love. Dear.. is this what the teacher teaches you in school? l have fallen in love with my teacher. By the way, uncle. Do you give discount to students? Come after 10 years. Okay. Go. l can't see her without my specs. And she doesn't want to see me in specs. This is very simple! Remove your specs! Fantastic! You are looking so good! Thank you! Here! React at the sound! So like this, smart, stupid, carefree, nervous.. ..l taught so many people to love! l made them love! Get married! l was at the peak of my success! But my happiness didn't last for long. Do you know why? "Do you wanna partner.." Bhaskar! Right? Yes! And you? You have come to meet me. - Love guru! Love guru in front of me! My first love! lt's my first love! My family's first love! Before this my parents, grandparents.. ..nobody loved at this level. What kind of a girl do you want? She should be beautiful! lntelligent! With a good nature! ln this time of inflation.. how will you be able to afford three girls? Tell me. Not three. lts three in one who has won my heart. She is true at heart. There she is! She is hale and hearty! Don't be tense. Don't worry. Your work will be done. My brother! l am lucky! Brother Prem! You are a great man! Priya, did you hear? Hello! What are you doing, Bhaskar? You love one girl and you kiss another girl. What do you mean? l kissed the girl whom l want to marry! She is Priya! She is the lucky one! Hero, do you know who she is? Priya Jaisingh! Raj Jaisingh's daughter! Owner of 1000 crores! Not just you, even l can't entice her! Forget about it, dude! No chance! lmpossible! lmpossible! Brother Prem.. impossible? l had heard there is no such word in your dictionary. Say that this is not true! This is the truth, Bhaskar! Bhaskar Diwakar Chaudhary! Yes! l can befriend Bush and Osama. But your affair with her is impossible! Just forget about it, man! But brother Prem, listen to me! Brother Prem! Bush? Osama? That international matter! And this is a small love story! Where is he taking the matter? Brother Prem! Welcome after the break! Let's ask our celebrity guest Priya Jaisingh.. ..some of her personal answers. Oh my! Priya! Welcome back to the show, Ms. Priya. So, Ms. Priya, what is your definition about love? Well, my beloved. Not found him yet! As it is nowadays you don't find good guys. What are you saying, Priya? l am available everyday in the office between 9 to 5. Do many times l did overtime too. One thing is for sure. My beloved whether he is a high profile, big shot or not.. ..but he will surely be simple and sound. Thank you. Thank you very much. Who knows? Maybe my future life partner is watching me right now.

You must have seen it in war. lt follows the enemy and attacks them. ls that so? How does this work? With a button? Not on battery. My voice. lt gets activated when l say go baby go. ls that so?

And brother Prem, l won't leave you so easily. l am like this missile! lf l go after a person, l don't leave him alone. You just have to say it once. Go, baby, go! Uncle, don't say that! lt will get activated! Are you mad? Why will l say go baby go? lt's yours! lt listens to your voice! You say go baby go! Just now you said go baby go! Hey, what happened?

Hey brother, escape and save us. Bhaskar, scoundrel, let me come out of the water first.. Save me. oh god. Hey, go somewhere else. Why are you behind me? Go somewhere else. Oh lord, please save me. Bhaskar, let me escape from this, then l'll teach you a lesson. Bhaskar! Bhaskar! Leave my house! Get lost! Leave this place! Sorry! By mistake the rocket got activated! By mistake! Your birth is a mistake in itself. l could have died! Do you know the cost of that jet ski? 10 lakhs! What do l know? l have always travelled by local train. You! - Brother! Please! lt was an accident! Please! Brother Bhaskar, say sorry to Prem! Please! Prem.. l am sorry. - Sorry! You.. Kids, come on! Uncle Bhaskar and l are having a fight. So go out! l regret that you turned out to be.. ..much more stupid than what l thought of you! Forget Priya! You can't even entice Priya's dog! Do you know why? Because Bhaskar.. you are the brand ambassador.. ..of foolishness and stupidity! Brand ambassador! And before leaving listen to one thing, Bhaskar! lf you can't live without Priya.. then don't live!

Pammi, remove him within 5 minutes. Otherwise l will leave at the Please Prem. Uncle Bhaskar! Uncle Bhaskar! Are you crying? Brother Bhaskar.. Prem is a nice guy. Please don't mind him and cry. l.. l am not crying, sister Pammi. l am laughing. Brother Prem is right. lt was my mistake.. that l fell in love with Priya. There is a huge difference between Priya and me. l was searching for a girl's love. And l got the love of a family. So l stayed here. So l stayed here. Look, l am an idiot. No. What was brother Prem saying? Yes! Loser! But you tell him one thing. He is doing a great task. He shouldn't stop! Uniting lovers! What about me? Fine. Brother Bhaskar! Brother Bhaskar! Brother Bhaskar! Phuket to Bangkok! Bus meets with an accident! One critically injured! Bhaskar was travelling by this bus! l am sure Bhaskar is the one! Bhaskar's name is not written in this! How can you say that it's Bhaskar! l can say that because Bhaskar is the King of bad luck! Problems don't go after Bhaskar! But Bhaskar runs after problems! All this happened because of you! - Why because of me? lf you had not send him by bus.. ..then today he would have been here! Thank God he was on the bus! - You are so mean! No! l am not mean! What is mean is that l too want that Bhaskar should be fine. He should lose his memory! So that he won't harass me! Stupid Bhaskar! - Prem! Listen! Where is the man who died in the bus accident? Some passenger of seat number 50. His name is Bhaskar. Bhaskar. Shit man, Bhaskar. Bhaskar, please forgive me. Look, what has happened? l told you to forget your love. And you left the world. Love is in nobody's control. But you left in the bus. And you made all of us helpless. You should have at least given my one chance. l would have introduced you to Priya. You are that lover.. who took his beloved's name.. ..and left his bag for me. Bhaskar, you are not dead. Because Bhaskar never die. God bless your soul, Bhaskar. Say something. l don't know why l feel that you will suddenly get up.. ..and embrace me. And you will forgive me. l forgive you. Oh no! Bhaskar, you are alive! Bhaskar, you are alive! Bhaskar, you are alive? Yes! Bhaskar is alive! Hale and hearty! Oh no, man! How did this happen? lt's all his grace. - Who is he? Who is this? He is uncle John. When l sat in the bus.. he said.. ..dear.. can l sit in your seat? l want to see the valleys from the window. l said, why not. Sit. Here there is only destruction. At least you see the valleys. Poor man.. he died while watching the valleys. And l came in this lovely hospital. lts Wadia hospital. - Yes. This is destiny! Your good luck.. and my bad luck. No, Prem! l heard it! You love me so much. l forgive you! You have a pure heart! You worry so much.. l am touched! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! You didn't die! So l break my promise! Brother Prem, just now you were talking so lovingly with me! Look, brother Prem! l have fooled death! l won't leave you alone! - ls that so? Because you are the messiah who can form my alliance with Priya. When Priya will give me a son, l will name him Prem! How sweet! - l will keep your photo in my house! - Thank you! Brother Prem, please help me! - No! You will have to help me! - No! Brother Prem, you will help me! - l won't help you! Brother Prem, you will have to help me! - No!

Any problem? Not l, but Priya might have a problem. - Why? She is a rich girl. Why will she kiss a common man like me? Don't worry. Girls shut their eyes before kissing. So she won't see your face. Oh! But is it necessary to kiss in love? Yes! lt's very important! Because from 10, 8 girls know in the first kiss itself.. ..whether this relationship will go further or not. l have a great idea! Shall l give a flying kiss to Priya? Are you Superman? Spiderman? You are a common man. Kiss like a common man. Okay. One final and last question. While kissing Priya.. shall l hold my breathe inside.. ..or shall l exhale? Asthma patient! What will you stop and what will you let go? How much will you think for a kiss? l think.. now l should leave. Anything else? 'lf a girl wants to kiss you then.. ..she will pretend to be deep in thoughts.. ..and she will play with the keys.'

You are in this business for the past 25 years? Yes! My daddy too is in this line. And everybody in the family looks familiar. We have been doing this for the past 7 generations. My grandpa's, grandpa's, grandpa.. ..had got Shahjahan married. Oh my God! What a marriage it was! What a grand reception in Taj! And wine was flowing non-stop in Jamuna river! And you know this? - No. People were throwing flowers from Kutub Minar. Guys in Sherwani (lndian traditional dress). Girls in skirts. The entire Agra was singing and dancing. What's up, father-in-law? Hello! Look at you! Are you sure that Priya will marry this guy? Yes. Why? l think she will change her mind after 4 nuptial rounds. "When we will grow young." Hello! Where is Bhaskar? l am sure they must have nabbed uncle. They must be thrashing him black and blue! You shouldn't say that! Mummy! Mummy! Hide! Rohan? How can he be here? What is your mummy doing here? Don't you know? Reporters reach anywhere. ls that so? When will she reach my heart? Have patience! She will reach there too! Let's go and find Bhaskar! Prem? Rohan? That's it! Prem, you and here? - Hi. l am also here. Actually we both were missing you a lot. ls that so? That's why you both came here? What joke is this? Mummy, l will tell you. Actually Prem has come here to help his friend. Prem's friend Bhaskar loves Priya. The bride of the day. Rohan, get up! To help your friend, you brought my son here! That too without informing me! What if something had happened to him? What would happen to him? Prem, maybe Rohan is nothing for you. But for me he is my world. Okay. He is my whole life. You wanted to be a father! You couldn't fulfil your responsibility even for 7 days! And you talk about 7 lifetimes! What.. - Just stop it! Okay! Prem, let me handle this. Mummy, Prem was not ready to come here. l only insisted. Saying let's go on this adventure trip. And l harassed him a lot on the route. But he was always there for me. Mummy, l like him! And l think you should also like him! Tough body and a soft heart. lt's a rare combination. Come on, mummy! Say sorry to papa. Papa? What did you say? No need to get so emotional! l was just practicing! What are you doing? May you always remain married! l mean.. l mean.. may you always be with me. Yes, place it below the glass. Oh wow! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You too! - Yeah! Me too! You know to have something you have to lose something. And you have to be what you are not. Wait a minute! Have we met before? No! l have just got converted. - Oh! New recruit you know. But still why do l feel as if l have seen you before? Hello! You know why? Because people like us resemble in appearance.. ..way of walking, this and that and everything. How true! How true! How true! Have you come alone or with somebody? l have come alone. But l will take somebody with me. You can have me! Hello! "My beloved's face tempts me." "Tempts me. Tempts me." "The shine of the nose ring takes my life." "My beloved's face tempts me." "The shine of the nose ring takes my life." "l can't live without seeing you." "Your beautiful face is charming." "Your veil.." "Your veil.." "Your veil.." "Your veil.." "Your veil has 9 colours." "lt craves for my heart." "Your veil has 9 colours." "lt craves for my heart." "Your veil.." "Your veil.." "Your veil has 9 colours." "lt craves for my heart." Find out who he is. Go on, hurry! "My life is for you." "Don't ever leave me." "Never leave me." "l will give you all the happiness in the world." "l will place my heart at your path." "Your beautiful face is charming." "Your veil.." "Your veil.." "Your veil.." "Your veil has 9 colours." "lt craves for my heart." "Your veil has 9 colours." "lt craves for my heart." That's him. "My beloved is different from the rest of the world." "Different from the rest of the world." "l will love him." "Him. Love him." "Adorn your fair hands with henna." "Adorn. Adorn." "Damsel, make me yours." "Your beautiful face is charming." "Your veil.." "Your veil.." "Your veil.." "Your veil has 9 colours."

Excuse me, excuse me. - Yes brother. There is money in my left pocket. Sorry sir, it is not allowed for you.. ..to come inside the building Strange, everyday you salute me.. ..and today you are stopping me. Have you forgotten, l am Bhaskar.. ..Bhaskar Diwakar Chaudhary. The company's financial advisor. l am a very close person of Ms. Priya. She has left this letter for you. Huh? Strange, she used to take my advice for every small thing.. ..she took such a big decision and didn't take my advice. Bhaskar has been insulted! Those who love each other, don't change.. ..reading the gossip of the paper. l agree that you are my boss, and the boss is always right.. But this time.. this time you are wrong. Girls are stupid! Just because one husband left her, she'll be angry against all males. You should never fall in love with a girl.. ..and that too, ajournalist. Brother Prem, you are avoiding me.. ..you are not picking up my phone. The cards for my marriage was about to be printed.. ..instead, my photo was printed in the papers. All this has happened because of you.. ..you will have to do something. Sorry Bhaskar, l have stopped doing this. l cannot help you. Brother Prem, seems like you didn't recognise me. Those who climbed the Himalayas.. ..and walked on the moon, they didn't have a guru. They one thing that they had, was zest in the heart.. ..and an obsessed mind. Which even l have. lf l don't get Priya, then l can do anything. Do you understand anything? Anything. Will Bhaskar commit suicide? He lost a billion dollar girl. Anyone could commit suicide. Bhaskar may do it. Ms. Priya, my name is Prem. l know. What are you doing in my boat? Get out! - l want to talk to you for two minutes. Shut up, what did you get from all this? Bhaskar is your happiness.. ..two lovers unite, what can be a bigger happiness. How, by making him act in the board room. Tell me one thing would you have ever noticed him? Why not, maybe a bit late.. ..but maybe l would have noticed him. His parents didn't notice him on his birth.. ..and you would have, l don't agree Ms. Priya. But l agree, it was really great Prem.. ..my likes, my dislikes you took care of everything. Even that, l don't know how to whistle since my childhood.. ..and you thought him that too. He whistled at you, the loafer. Yes, he did the loafer dance too.. ..and sometimes dropped coffee on his shirt.. ..in nervousness. And the best touch was that one. - What? He took the asthma pump out. He took the asthma pump out too. And that too before kissing me. - What timing. l liked all his habits and they appeared to be cute! Why are you laughing? Because, l didn't teach him all these things.. ..l had stopped him from doing all these things. Tell me one thing, the daughter of such a rich father.. ..you are educated, sensible, stylish.. ..how did you see sense in Bhaskar's nonsense? What do you mean? l mean, style can be taught, but not simplicity. Not just me, no college or university of the world.. ..can make a person nice. And you know Bhaskar is a nice person from the beginning. Oh God, what will happen to Bhaskar? Hey, what will happen, he will fall in love with me.. ..we will get married, we will have children.. ..and the children will call you Prem uncle, Prem uncle. So this was your game love guru! - Bhaskar.. You wanted to become the lover of my girl.. ..and dance with joy on the boat.. ..and l will keep waiving at you from the shore. Bhaskar! - You hold it! l thought that you think of me as your elder brother.. ..and Priya as your sister-in-law.. ..but you are a stigma in the joint family! No Bhaskar! He had come here for you. Oh shit! l couldn't teach her in years.. ..and you taught her in minutes. Bhaskar, l learnt it from you! Cheating! Stop it! l used to practice this everyday thinking about you. l would whistle all the time! Anytime, anyhow. - Yes, yes. You are sure, l thought you how to whistle. You love me. - l love you. Where did brother Prem go l told him lot things? Brother Prem! Brother Prem, sorry to misunderstand you brother. So much happiness.. So much happiness, brother Prem.. Keep quiet. Stupid Bhaskar. So much happiness. So much happiness. So much happiness. Today's topic is trust. lf there is trust, there is love.. ..and if there is love, then there is life. Prem, here. Naina, Naina please let me say something. Don't create a scene here. - Say something. Mummy, you should fulfil the last wish of the dying person. Give him a chance. Who is dying? lf you don't get her, then you will die. Yes. Look, he knows me so well. He's a kid. l'm not. You have made love your profession. Profession? Am l a courtesan.. ..that you say love is my profession? Please, let him say. - Thank you father. Father, is it wrong to make two hearts fall in love.. ..if it is, then hang me. No my son, it is a divine service. Come on, you tell me if you go and tell a unknown woman.. ..that l love you, then what will she say? Then she will slap me. l have been slapped 27 times.. ..and l am still a bachelor, look the seat is empty. That seats not empty, that's a shame.. ..some days later this seat will be empty too.. ..until a love guru like me doesn't come in your life. Correct. - Thank you. Son, find someone for me too. l am single, ready to mingle. Give me your hand, madam he is single ready to mingle. Lord Ram, what match you have made. You are doing a wonderful job, and l love you for that. l know, but tell her that and not me. See, he will find someone here. Think about it mummy, you will not find anyone better than him. Correct. Naina, l teach the shortcut way in love.. ..but my path is not wrong. And what about boys like Neil.. ..whom you help to reach the girls bedroom. Neil, do you want to hear the truth? - What? The truth is that, l don't help people like Neil. He has taken my name just to entrap me! But it is the fault of people like you! You fall for scoundrels like Neil.. ..and you don't even look once at simple guys like Bhaskar! That's is where l step in. l am cupid, stupid. l will drink milk everyday, l will do my homework too.. ..l will never lie, l will do whatever you ask me to.. ..but don't let him go. Mummy, you will not find a better one than him. My child, they don't make such men anymore. O Lord, forgive her, for she doesn't know what she has done.. ..and forgive her for she doesn't know.. ..what she is doing, what's she doing, what's she doing. What are you doing here? Can't you find a taxi, shall l drop you in my car. Look, l don't know what relation we have.. ..and if we have a relation or not.. ..but l know, that Rohan and l have the relation of father and son. lsn't it Rohan? - Yes papa. Rohan, who will drop you to school? Of course papa, you. Rohan, who will take you to the movies? Papa, you. Rohan, who will entice your first girlfriend for you. Of course papa you. And who will take care of my mother? You will have to ask your mother that. Rohan's papa. - What? You, you. Do you swear on Rohan's future brother and sister? Shall we go home l have to make arrangements.. ..for the honey moon! Whose? - Yours. My lady.. Rohan was right l can never find anyone better than you. And even if l do find one, l don't want it.. ..do you know why? - Why? Because l am a married man.. ..and l already have a child, and l am a devoted father. And a wife abiding husband. Really? lf you will have decide between me and Rohan? Right now. At this time. That will be the most difficult. Who is.. Maybe it is Rohan. l will just come.
