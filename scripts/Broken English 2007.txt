She Scares Me. She'S So Tacky. Look At Those Lips. It'S The Only Part Of Her Face That Can Move. What An Idiot. You Two Are The Most Judgmental People In The World. Who Watches These Stupid Entertainment Shows? It'S Better Than Watching The News. Propaganda Nightmare. Oh, Look. Turn It Up. Oh. People Wonder What' S Inside The Mind Of A Hitman. You Know, These Guys Are Sick, Sick Guys. You Know, As A Result, They Spend A Lot Of Time Alone, So Most Of My Scenes Were Shot Virtually By Myself, You Know. I Think I'M Gonna Be Ok, Though. Ooh. Woman On Tv: Don' Feel Too Sorry For This Guy. He'S Been Dating His Sexyhitmancostar Serena Hill. Serena. Oh, God. Oh, Serena--She'S A Great Woman. She'S Totally Refreshing, And, Uh, I'M Crazy About Her. What Else Can I Say? That'S Probably Al L I Should Say, You Know What I'M Saying? What Is Wrong With Me? Why Can'T I Meet Someone Nice? There'S Nothing Wrong With You, Nora. You Just Go Out With The Wrong People. Stop Dating Actors. They'Re Crazy. No, That'S Actresses. I Shouldn'T Go Out With Anyone Anymore. I'M Going Home. Hey, Don'T Feel Bad. That Guy'S A Jerk. I Love You. Me, Too. Ok, I'Ll Call You. Ok. Oh, God. Poor Nora. She Has The Worst Time With Men.

Don'T Fight Me All The Time. I Think You'Re Great. I Worship You. I Put You On A Pedestal. Like An Object. Shut Up. Honey, Do You Feel All Right? You Look Pale. I'M Ok. You Don'T Think You Should See The Doctor? No. No. I'M Fine. Really. Thank You, Though. I'Ve Just Been Working Too Hard And Just Drinking Too Much, Smoking Too Much.

How Are Things With Your Boyfriend? Oh, It'S Over. Oh, Is That Why You'Re Depressed? No, That'S Not It. I Just Feel Like I Have The Worst Luck In The World When It Comes To Men. I Think I Must Be Doing Something Horribly Wrong, But I Don'T Know What It Is. What Happened? Oh, He Has A Girlfriend. Oh. You Know, I Can' Quit Thinking About How Hard It Must Be For Young Women Nowadays. I Mean, On The One Hand, The World Is Wide Open To You. All The Choices You Want. I Think There Are Too Many Choices, Really. It Just Must Be Very Confusing To Try To Find A Path Through All Of That, Especially With Men, Though You Have Had Some Very Nice Boyfriends. I Know... But That Was College. I Don'T Know What Happened. I Feel So Closed Off, So Desperate To Find Someone To Love. Oh, Honey. Even I Can'T Stand The Sight Of My Own Desperation. Honey, Hey, You Know What? You'Re In A Funk, That'S All, And There'S Only One Way To Get Out Of A Funk, And That Is To Engage. Even If You Don' Feel Like It, Just Fake It. Just Go Out And Get The Highest Heels In Town And Some New Lipstick And Go Everyplace. [Laughs] Smile. Act Like You'Re Having The Time Of Your Life. But Don'T Always Go With Married Couples. You'Re Never Gonna Meet Anyone That Way. Sure. I'Ll Give It A Try, You Know. You Know... I Could Fix You Up. No. Now, Just Listen To Me For A Minute. You Know Megan Ross, My Friend. She Has A Son.

She Went Through A String Of Them After My Parents Divorced, But She Always Drives Them Away, On Purpose, I Think. I Wonder If We Always Turn Into Our Parents. I Like To Think Of It As Where My Parents Left Off. That'S A Great Way Of Putting It. Oh, Shit. Nora: What? Uh, Nothing. It'S Just My E X, Jennifer. Y. She'S Totally Craz Is It Gonna Be Ok?

I'M Really Sorry. You'Re So Nice. Nora: Men Hate Me. You Hate Yourself. No, I Don'T. Why Do You Say That? You'Ve Got To Stop Punishing Yourself All The Time For Not Having A Boyfriend. Everyone Else Is In A Relationship. Why Can'T I Be In One? You'Ll Meet Someone. Just Don'T Go Nuts Next Time. It'S Like The Only Thing That Matters Is Finding This Guy. It Doesn'T Even Matter Who It Is. Not Every Guy You Meet Has To Be Your Future Husband. Believe Me. Do Something Else. Go To Yoga Or Something. You'Re Right. I'M Being A Total Freak. I Have To Calm Down. I Love You. I Don'T Like To See You Like This. [Cell Phone Music Plays] Oh, God. One Minute. Yeah. Uh-Huh. Ok. It'S Mark. He'Ll Be Here In Two Minutes. Where Was He? Mmm.

No. I'M Sorry. I'M Just An Idiot. You Didn'T Do Anything. I Just Blew Things Out Of Proportion. We Were Having So Much Fun. I'M Fine Now. You Know, Nora, I'M Leaving Tomorrow, And I Thought Maybe We Could Spend This Night Together If You Want. Tomorrow? Yes. Very Early. I Had The Best Time With You, Nora. Me, Too. Come With Me. Come To See Paris. Come On The Plane Tomorrow And Run Away With Me. No. I Can'T. I Can'T. Why Not? A Million Reasons. Like, I Couldn' Possibly Be Ready To Do That In Time. I--I Have To Work. I Have Obligations. Those Are Only Some Excuses, All Right? I Want You To Come. What Are You Gonna Do? Stay All Your Life, Do The Same Thing? No. I'M--I'M Just Being Realistic. We'Ve Only Known Each Other For A Couple Of Days. I Can'T Just Pretend That Everything Would Just Magically Work Itself Out. I Know Better. You Shouldn'T Make Promises That You Can'T Keep. Why Not? I Don'T Know. Uh... It'S Just Not What I Imagined For Myself. I'M Not Like That. Why? Because I'M French, Because I'M Younge R Than You? What Is It? Yeah. You Live In Another Country. We'Ve Had A Really Nice Weekend. You Shouldn'T Feel Bad About It. I Don'T Want To Fight About This Now. I'Ll Come To Paris With You And We'Ll Just See How It Goes Sometime In The Future. You Promise? Yeah. [Alarm Clock Buzzing] Ok, Nora. I Have To Go. I Had A Great Time With You. Don'T Cry. I Left My Cell Phone Number Next To Your Bed. [Crying] Come Here. Kiss Me. [Door Closes] What? You Need To Go On A Date. Ugh. No. Mm-Hmm. Duty Dating. What'S That? There'S A Theory That You Should Go Out With Guys Who Ask You Out, Even If You Know You Don'T Like The M In That Way. For Practice. That Is The Saddest Thing I Think I'Ve Ever Heard. No, It'S Not. You Need To Get Out There Again. Otherwise, You'Re Just Gonna Retreat. I Know You, Nora. Nobody'S Asking Me Out. Uh-Uh Steve, You Tell Nora You Were An Architect? Yeah. I Was Doing Private Homes And Office Buildings. I Mostly Build Boutique Hotels Now. I Have To Say, It'S Really Challenging, You Know... Mm-Hmm. Making Each One Different. Mm. Nora Works In A Hotel, Sullivan House. Is That Right? Yeah. Do You Like It? No. Not Really. Hi, Nora. You Got A Minute? Yeah. I Just Wanted To Talk To You Seriously Just For A Bit. Ok. I Was Wondering, Um, How It'S Going, How You'Re Doing With The Planning Of The Company Picnic. Oh. That. Um, I, Uh, Haven' Really Gotten Around To It Yet. We'Ve Been Kind Of Swamped. Haven'T Got Around To It Yet? Uh, Nora, There'S Only 5 Weeks Left. I Mean, There'S A Lot More To It Than--Than Just Locations Alone. I Mean, You'Ve Got Food And Invites, Buses, Games, Employee Of The Month. Have You Even Voted For The Employee Of The Month Yet? Not Yet. Well, When Were You Planning On Doing All Of This? T. I Don'T Know. I'M Sorry. I Forgo Look. You Know What? I Don'T Understand What'S Wrong With You Lately, Nora. You Were Always So Reliable, And Now You Don'T Even Come Around Anymore. Nobody'S Seen You. What'S Wrong With You? Is Everything Ok? Because You Cannot Go On Like This. You Know What, Perry? You'Re Right. I Can'T Go On Like This. I'Ve Been Awful. I Can'T Do This Anymore. Do What? This! I Can' Do This Anymore! I See Something In You. Huh? I Can Tell You Things About Your Life. Your Father Misses You. You Were His Favorite Person In The World. [Sobs] He Knows How Lonely You Are, And He Wants Me To Help You. Come Inside. Audrey: So Wait A Minute. You Went To A Psychic To Have A Curse Put On You. Please. I'M Humiliated Enough As It Is. She Didn'T Put A Curse On Me. She Removed A Curse. Did You Pay Her? I Don'T Want To Talk About It. No. Please. I Have To Know So I Can Understand Your Insanity. I Don'T Know. I'M Going Totally Crazy. You'Ll Be Fine. No, I Won'T. I Quit My Job, And I Went To A Witchdoctor. I Can'T Believe You Quit Your Job. I Know. Do You Think That Was The Right Thing To Do? Maybe It Was. Maybe I Should Have Gone With Julian. Why Didn'T You? I'M A Coward. So...What Are You Gonna Do About It? Is This Safe? It'S Fine. Relax. We Don'T Even Know What'S In Here. ? What If It'S Drugs It Is Not Drugs. My Parents Know The Guy. I Can'T Believe We'Re Doing This. Listen. It Was The Only Cheap Ticket. I Swear. Oh! I Hate Mark. He'S Mad That We'Re Doing This Courier Shit, Riding Coach. Oy. Audrey: Uh, Hi. We'Re Not Sure Where To Go. Um, We Need A Small, Little Hotel In The Middle Of Town That'S Not Very Expensive. I Don'T Think He Understands You. Oh, No. I Think He Does. They Just Pretend Not To Understand. Watch This. Excusez-Moi. Vous Comprendre? Oui, Oui. I Understand. Hmm? Merci Beaucoup. Thank You Very Much. I Hope You Find Happiness. A Penis? Yes. Oh... Skanky. Well, At Least It Has A Bathroom. This Really Sucks. I'M Sorry, Audrey. Don'T Be Ridiculous. We'Re In Paris. We'Re Gonna Find Julian. Let'S Deliver Thes E Packages First, Get It Out Of The Way. We'Re So Crazy For Doing This. . I Know. It'S Totally Crazy You Know, We Could Probably Get A Map Downstairs. Oh, You'Re So On It. Well, It'S Probabl Y Just Easier For Me To Be Objective Right Now. When Should We Meet Back Here? I Don'T Know. Like An Hour, An Hour And A Half? But If We Get Held Up, Let'S Jus T Call The Hotel And Touch Base, Ok? Ok. Ok. Now Which Way Is The Seine? Because I Am Going The Opposite Direction. Excusez-Moi. Oui? Do You Speak English? A Little. Could You Tell Me Where The Hotel Meurice Is? Uh, It'S Just Over There. Ok. Great. [No Audio] [No Audio] Madame Grenelle? Madame Grenelle? Qui Est La? Nora: Uh, I'M Sorry. Je Ne Parlez Francais. Do You Speak English? Of Course I Speak English. What Do You Want? My Name Is Nora. I Have A Package For You. The Door Was Open. Well, Bring It To Me. I Hope I'M Not Bothering You. It'S Been A Long Time. Excuse Me? [Knock On Door] Mr. Larson? Hi. I'M Audrey. Come In. Please Sit Down. Thank You Very Much. I Wouldn'T Entrust Thi S To The Regular Mail. But I Have To Say I Didn'T Imagine Someone Like You Delivering It To Me. Are You Surprised? Yes. Are You Hungry? Um, Actually, Yeah, I Am. Let'S Go. You Turned Out Very Pretty. Thank You. You Know, Your Mother Never Let Me See You Much. I Think She Was Ashamed Of Me, And She Moved To America. She Was Always Taking These Wild Chances, And Your Father Was Quite Handsome. Where Do You Live? New York City. Are You Married? No. But You Want To Be. Yeah. I Guess So. Why? I Don'T Know. I, Um... I Guess Then I Would Really Know That Someone Loved Me. Marriage Is A Contract, But To Feel Love Is Something Else Entirely. I Don'T Think I' Ve Ever Really Been In Love. You Have Probably Been In Love Lots Of Times. Besides, You Are Young. You Have Time. But I'M Getting Older. You Will Be Fine. You Are From Good Stock. Don'T Let Anyone Tell You Otherwise. You Will Get Nowhere In This World By Feeling Sorry For Yourself. So What Will Happen To You When Your Friend Finds This Man? Depending On How Happy He Is To See Her, Either I'Ll Leave On My Own, Or I'Ll Take Nora With Me. I Love Being In Paris. My Wife Loves It Here. Sometimes Comes With Our Children. And She Doesn'T Mi Nd You Taking Another Woman To Lunch? Not At All. Does Your Fiance Mind You Going To Lunch With Me? Yeah. I Don'T Thin K He'D Be Too Crazy About Me Having Lunch With A Handsome Stranger In Paris. No. D. And He'S My Husban I Just Forgot To Wear My Ring. Is That Terrible? You Know, I Think In Relationships There Are Things You Are Honest About And Things You Choose To Keep To Yourself. Are You Good At Keeping Secrets, Audrey? I Have To Call My Friend. Can I Borrow Your Cell Phone, Please? [Muffled Voices] [Door Opens] [Audrey Sighs] Sorry I'M Late. What'S Going On Here? What Happened? Nora, What Happened? Did We Get Robbed Or Something? I Lost The Piece Of Paper With Julian'S Number On It. What? I Looked Everywhere. Look At This Place. It'S Gone. Ok. We'Ll Find It. You Don'T Understand. I Looked Everywhere Well, I'Ll Look Again With Fresh Eyes, Ok? What About The Phone Book Or Information? [Groans] His Last Name Is Durand. It'S Like The Smith Of France. Then I Talked To The Concierge For, Like, An Hour. I'Ve Tried Everything. I Even Called Glen. He Wasn'T There. [Groans] Are You Ok? Well, I Want To Feel That Way, Too. All Right. This. I'M Gonna Go Take A Shower. I'Ll Be Back. Ok. [Shower Running] Audrey: I'M Sorry About Today. You Called. Tomorrow Will Be Fun. Thanks For Coming With Me. I Love You, Nora. I Love You, Too. Good Night. Good Morning. Whoa. You'Re Pretty Chipper Today. Yeah. This Is Ridiculous. I Came Here To Surprise Some Guy I Hardly Know That I Can'T Find, But So What? We'Re In Paris. Yeah. We'Ve Always Wanted To Do This. Yeah. So Let'S Just Enjoy It. It'S Time I Got My Sense Of Humor Back. Good For You. I Think We Should Still Look Around Town For Your Mystery Man. You Never Know. We May Run Into Him. Yeah. What Do I Have To Lose At This Point? Nothing. Plus We Can Go Shopping. Right. [Thunder] Audrey: Ohh. I Can'T Believe It'S Raining In Paris. I Can'T Believe I Thought I'D Find Julian In These Places Unless He'S Into Women'S Clothes. Do You Want To Get A Tea Or Something? A Tea? That'S Funny. Ha Ha Ha! Thank You. Merci. Did You See What Was In The Package? Just Some Business Papers. What About You? No. Nothing Too Exciting. The Old Lady Was Really Cool. She Thought I Was Her Granddaughter. God. That Kind Of Thing Only Happens To You, Nora. Ha Ha! Ahh. Mark Called This Morning. He Said He Missed Me. Wanted To Know If I Wanted To Work On Our Relationship. Do You? I Suppose. I Mean, I Guess I Just Shouldn'T Throw My Marriage Away Without Trying. I Mean, I Do Really Love Him. Maybe I Just Shouldn' Be So Critical Just Because Things Aren' In The Greatest Place, You Know? I Think That'S Great, Audrey. Ok. Let'S Do It. Audrey... I Know I'M Crazy, But I Think I'M Gonna Stay. [Drops Suitcase] Nora, I Am Your Friend, And I Love You, But This Just Isn' T Working Out. You Got To Give This Up. I Can'T. You Go. I Know Mark Is Waiting For You. Nora, You Have No Sense Of Direction, And You Are Way Too Shy. Do You Want Me To Stay With You? Because I Will. No. I Have To Do This For Myself. I Have To Stop Relying On Other People To Make Decisions For Me. You'Re Gonna Come Home, Aren'T You? Yeah. I Have No Job And No Money. I Have To Come Back To Reality Soon. What Are You Gonna Do? I Don'T Know. Something I Feel Like Doing, I Guess. Well, I'M Really Proud Of You. I Got To Go. I Know. Ok. I'Ll Call You. You Weirdo. [No Audio] [Speaking French] I Don'T Speak French. Ah. I Said, "It Makes Me Want To Cry." You Are American? What Are You Doing In Paris? Just Looking. Just Looking? You Like Art. [Knock On Window] Ah. I Go With My Friends. We Go Have A Coffee. You Want To Come With Us? No, Thank You. Ok. Well, If You Change Your Mind, We'Ll Be Just Across The Street, Ok? Ok. I'Ll See You There. [Man Speaking French] [Speaking French] Ah, Si, Si. Eh, Come, Come. Hi. Hi. Sit Down, Sit Down. What'S Your Name? Nora. Nora, Hi. I'M Guillaume. Guillaume. This Is Sebastien. Nice To Meet You. And That'S Karim. Enchante. Would You Like A Glass Of Wine? Yes? Let'S Toast. [Speaks French] No, No, No. No Crossing. Go First. And Then The Others. Voila! Is That Crossing If I Do That? No. No, No. That'S Fine. It'S Direct Line. We Drink Now. Ha Ha Ha! So What Are You Doing In Paris, Nora? I'M Looking For Someone. And Did You Find Him? No. No. Well, You'Re Not So Bad Right Now. Not Bad. Are All French Guys Like This? Like What? Um, Passionate, Interested, Uh... Mm-Hmm. Attentive But Kind Of Like Dogs, Too? No, No. Dogs? The Women--The Women Are The Ones, You Know? The Last Time I Had A Girlfriend, All The Time We Had Some Fight. She Tried To Jump Out Of The Window All The Time. Yeah. Ha Ha! No. That Was Super-Scary. It Wasn'T Funny, You Know, Especially For Me. Sorry. There'S One, She Tried To Stop Me. Yeah, But That Was Crazy, You Know. It'S True. Did You Ever Think That Maybe You Were The Ones Driving Them Crazy? No, No, No, No. I Don'T Think So, No. Not Like This. Because I'Ve Heard Differently. Yeah? Yeah. Because Of The French Mothers. What, Uh--What About The French Mothers? They, Um, They'Re In Love With Their Sons. And The American Mothers Are Not? Not As Much. I Think Because Of The Food. Here You Go. Merci. Bartender: Bonsoir, Monsieur. Bonsoir, Mademoiselle. Bonsoir. Are You American? Yes. Why? Because You Look A Very Beautiful American Woman Sitting Alone In This Bar. Maybe I'M Waiting For Someone. Well, But You Look Alone. No? My Name Is Jean Paul Claremont. What'S Yours? Nora Wilder. Nice To Meet You, Nora. Nice To Meet You. May I Offer You Another Drink? Sure. Well, After This One. Cheers. I Mean, What Were The Chances That I Would Find Him? But, You Know, The Funny Thing Is After A While I Wasn'T Even Looking For Julian. I Was Just Doing My Own Thing, And It Felt Good. It'S Not Wrong To Want Someone To Love You. Most People Are Together Just So They Are Not Alone, But Some People Want Magic. I Think You Are One Of Those People. Nothing Wrong With That? Nothing, But It Doesn' Happen All The Time. Does It Ever Happen? First, Nora, You Must Find Love And Happiness In Yourself. Do You Understand? I Think So. Oh. We Are Both Drunk. I Will Put You In A Taxi To Your Hotel. It'S Time To Go. Jean Paul: Tomorrow, You Will Start Your Life Again. I Don'T Know Why, But I Will Never Forget You. I'Ll Never Forget You Either. Never. [Telephone Ringing] Hello? Audrey: Hey, Nora. It'S Me. Audrey, Hi. How'S It Going? Everything'S Ok. I'M Just Leaving For The Airport In A Couple Of Minutes. Well, Did You Find Him? No, I Didn'T, But I'M All Right. Really? Yeah, I Really Am. Ok. Good. Listen. I Got To Go, But I'Ll Call You On The Way To The Airport, Ok? Ok. I Miss You. Oh, I Miss You, Too. Fly Safe, Ok? Ok. All Right. Bye. Bye. Hi. Nora. . I Can'T Believe It What Are You Doing Here? Well, I'M--I'M Going To A Sound Expo At Le Bourget, But What Are You Doing Here? I--I'M Going To The Airport. What Time Is Your Flight? In 3 Hours. They Make You Get To The Airport So Early Now. [Man Speaks French] [Julian Speaks French] Merci. Ok. I Just Want To Ask What You Are Doing Here. Did You Come To See Me? Because I Don' Understand. I Like You So Much, And I Never Hear Anything From You, And Then You Are Just Here In Front Of Me Now. Why? It'S Really Complicated. Ok, But Try To Explain. I Came Here To Find You. Then I Lost Your Number. [Sighs] You Came Here To See Me? And You Never Find Me? But Then You Find Me? And Now You Leave? So You Like Me? Yes. Would You Stay With Me For Another Drink? But You Know You'Re Gonna Miss Your Flight? I Know. ? Could Have Come Through ? Anytime Cold, Lonely Puritan What Are You Fighting For?
