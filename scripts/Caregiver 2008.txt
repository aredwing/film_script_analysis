Some don't even realize they've already reached the place. They still seem lost. Something tells them to keep walking. That the destination is just up ahead. Often when we walk that road... the footprints behind us disappear. Because we're creating new paths each time. I knew you'd be happy. We'll do as planned. We'll be together, Hon. Tell Paulo it's my request. And you, find a buyer already. Ma'am, I was worried you won't go to class anymore. I had to arrange the kids' papers. Let's hurry, I'm late. Practice this carefully. You can't just stand around when your patient gets an attack. Learn how to read food labels. Know the nutritional content of what you prepare for your patients. - Are you sure - You can't go abroad... your BP is too high! Ma'am, should we take her to the hospital? In a severe state of a person suffering from Alzheimer's disease... he needs help in "activities of daily living" or ADL. He may even experience acute confusion... delusion, hallucination, and seizures. Remember, there is no treatment available yet for this disease. All dishes have to be in solid color, anyone know why? - Ma'am, so they can easily see the food. - Correct. How does the heart change as we grow older? As the body ages, the heart rate slows down, causing slower pulse rate and blood circulation. The blood vessels become narrower. Return him to position slowly... before you fasten the strap. If this is a real foreigner, he will be very heavy. Who wants to try? Galang, Alex! They disapproved my visa... I got confused by their English at the embassy! - Where did you apply? - Japan. - You studied Japanese? - It's very easy, because I'm very bright. - Sarah, where did you apply? - U.K. - Really? What's the language there? - Ukrainian, of course! You can't go there if you don't know that! You have to be bright like me. Pau, come help Mama. Thanks, Garci. You won't have a problem with water here. The place is cool, especially when the windows are open. There are only two of us, so we leave them closed. Makes cleaning easier. This is the master's bedroom. It faces east so it's cool even in the afternoon. It's spacious. So many possibilities for design. Come. Excuse me, son. Come in. This is my son Paulo. This is perfect for the Nursery. Even closer to the- Do you want to see outside? Time's up, pass your papers. Class, I have a very important announcement to make. Starting next Monday, Mrs. Biglaen is taking over this class. She will be your new English teacher. I want you to be as attentive and diligent in her class... as you have been in mine. Miss, where are you going? I will be working abroad. Like Mrs. Silvosa? Yes, but Mrs. Silvosa is in Kuwait, while I will be going to London. - Miss, my sister is also in London! - Really, what does she do there? Caregiver! She told me she wipes the butts of the older people there. You girls are mean! When I get there, that's probably what I'll be doing. So what? Pounds are bigger than dollars! And life there is pleasurable! In fact, you're lucky, Sarah. My cousin, who is a nurse in UK, owns a house! During the vacation season, they turn Paris in to their local shopping mall. From what I know, you can get a British passport in just five years! What, five years? - Five years of wiping butts? - Don't you start! - Ma'am, I put it in the freezer. - Thank you. So you're certain on your decision to go? Everything is set I'm just waiting for the plane ticket. I don't know if I still have to tell you this... If it still has a bearing on your decision... What is it, Ma'am? Remember early this year, we had an evaluation on your performance? The results are in. By next school year, if you're still with us... you qualify for a promotion as English Department Head. - Really? - Yes. So are you really pushing through with your plans? That's what my husband wants. Too bad. It's so hard to look for good English teachers these days. I know the opportunity is there... But if all we think about are selfish reasons, what will happen to this country? Wait! Let's go. I tried to tell Teddy not to sell your house anymore. Teddy wants to pay off all the debts from the business. Then use what's left for my travel and pocket money. But you can still borrow from his Aunt Loida! He doesn't want to borrow especially not from relatives. That's his pride talking again. Pau? I'll just get the computer. Teddy wants Paulo to stay with you. That's the right thing to do. So I can have some company here. When you get to London, you and Teddy won't stop fighting again, will you? No one will break your fight there. I don't think it's a problem. Dear... Be patient with Teddy. I hope you both find your fortune in London. Also, tell him to send money. My medicine is getting expensive. I'll tell him. You know, if his Daddy were here, we wouldn't be in this situation. Pau? Pau? I know you're angry. It's your Dad who wants you here with your Grandma. I know. I tried to explain, I couldn't do anything- Pau. Pau. Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with you... Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners... Hi Auntie! - Did you get my text? - Yes, Brother's over there. You got new games? Easy with the box, that's food! - How are you? - I'm homeless now! Ma! - Where's Grandma? - In her room. I'll go get her. What happened to her? She went looking for ice cream. She stepped outside by herself. A bus almost hit her, when she got startled by the horn. She fell on the street. Luckily, it's just two stitches. Why are you here? Grandma, it's time to eat. Grandma, it's time to eat. Come on, Grandma. Who is this person? That's Sarah! Who's Sarah? Grandma, I'm your grand daughter, don't you recognize me? Sarah? That's Sarah, my sister! Grandma can't remember many things lately. Don't worry, she sometimes can't even remember Sister Betty. Grandma, I'll help you up. Be careful. Please assist me, Dear. - I forgot to turn off the light. - Let me do it. Sorry, I'm late! I brought chicken pastel! Sarah, you won't find a chicken pastel like this in UK! - I made it for you. - Thank you. Thank God, you won't find that kind of food there. Grandma, why aren't you eating your food? You should eat. Try this, it's very delicious. Ma, Grandma doesn't remember me anymore. That's because your last visit was when? Last Christmas? Ma! We were here last Lenten Season! We stayed one week! Wasn't that just recently? - Why are you raising your voice? - Because I know what you're going to say! That I don't visit you regularly... that Paulo's growing up not knowing his grandmother... - I know where this is going! - But it's true! That Teddy drove you away from us. You had a nice job here in Manila. Your husband took you to rot in the province... to manage their family's failing business. Now he's totally separating you from us in another country! Ma... Teddy just wants a better life. But why must you and your son follow him there? That's what Teddy wants. How about you? Is that what you want too? - Sarah! - What? Did you allow Paulo to go out with Alvin? No, he didn't ask permission. They left all dressed up... - to go to a birthday party. - Why didn't you tell me right away? I could tell he was lying so I said I'll ask you first. That boy is going to get it. Well, where are they? - Maybe they're out in the corner. - Hurry, we have to catch them. Auntie! They just left with their friends! Alvin is with him anyway! That's exactly why I'm worried. Relax, you're stressing yourself! This kid tends to make me... because we decided that he'll stay in the province and not here with his cousins. He's mad because I didn't defend his wishes against Teddy. That I wasn't even able to convince him I should stay. I'll deal with you tomorrow! Sarah? Your son didn't come home. What? What did you say? They said Alvin's home but Paulo isn't with them. Wait, I'll just change. Pau? Alvin, where's Pau? He went to buy something at the corner- At this hour, there's a store open in the corner? Alvin, you're older than Paulo. You shouldn't have left him! What's going on? Alvin? It's Pau, Ma. He insisted to be dropped off at the corner. - What for? - Thanks anyway. You idiot! I told you not to leave your cousin by himself. He's a province boy! - Sarah, what's going on? - It's nothing, Ma. Paulo didn't come home with the others. Where did he go? He asked to be dropped off in the corner. We should look for him. You know it's dangerous these days. There are many drug addicts outside. - Let's go to the town patrol. - Do you think he ran away? - Answer! Did he run away? - He didn't say anything! He just asked to be dropped off. We were surprised ourselves. Was he drunk? If he's drunk, he wouldn't come home so soon. Of course he'll wait until he's sobered up. Answer! - Bechay... - Julia, you're early! By any chance, did you see a teenager pass by here? Julia, I'll check over here. Pamela, have you seen my nephew? Let's go home. I don't want to leave if you're angry at me. Give me that! When did you learn to drink? At Daddy's farewell party. So now you're drinking because I'm going away too. Is that so? Are you leaving because of me? I can transfer to another school. I can study in a public school. I don't mind. Don't think that way. You know your Daddy and I will petition you as soon as possible. You're not transferring to a different school. You won't! Mommy, I promise... Someday I'll buy our house back. Even Grandpa's business, we'll take it back. Is this what you'll do when I'm gone? Get drunk? And run away? I didn't run away. I just wanted to be alone. I just wanted to breathe. You know son, you're my last remaining source of strength. If you keep that way... I don't know how I'll manage. Grandma... Here's your favorite. Stand up. Nemie... Can you get me my shawl? Are you cold, Mother? Not really. Sarah... Yes? Isn't it cold there? Yes. You can have this. Thank you, Grandma. Take care of yourself. I will. How much is this one? Try this on. - I don't want to. - Come on, just try it on. There. Why do you have to buy me this? When you're not taking me with you? This is our contract. I'm buying this for you in advance. Because I promise you'll join us whatever happens. I want you to wear this when I come to get you, ok? This is too big! For allowance! To buy some time for me and your Daddy. If this gets too tight that means I didn't fulfill our deal. Like a deadline, ok? What's your jacket, Mommy? Pau, don't think bad of me, ok? Don't get angry. Don't feel bad because I left you, ok? Ok. Promise? When you get old, don't nag me about leaving you, ok? Ok, son? Remember, this is your Dad's plan for you. This is his dream for us. Try to be a little patient? Anyway, many of my classmates have parents who are also away... It's in fashion. I'm serious. When I'm gone text me as many times in a day. Then call me as much as you want. Anytime, ok? You'll send me mobile phone load money? This is the first time we'll be separated. I'll miss you too. And you said, we will be together by the time this fits me, well... I think I grow fast. Mommy, you should pick your jacket because I'm already hungry. You're ruining my moment! Ok, which one? Do you think this looks good on me? - Sarah! - Teddy! You know it's hard here when you're alone, especially in winter. It's a good thing you're here. Now we can help each other. Do you think I can handle it? Of course you can. Don't be scared. You'll get used to it. I promise to work hard so we can fulfill our plans quickly. Come in, Honey. - Sorry about the mess. I didn't clean. - We live here? This will be Paulo's. I'm sure he'll like it. This is our room. Come. Honey? Isn't this expensive? It seems too big for us. This is just right. It's practical to live here. The hospital is a walk's distance. Your carehome is one bus ride from here. We work like horses so we deserve this. I'll get the other luggage downstairs. Welcome home, Honey. I missed you. I missed you more. You're going already? - It's time for my duty. - Let me make you something to eat. I'll just have coffee, I'm going to be late. That's not good. Honey... I'll take some fish paste for Joseph and Karen, ok? They're the ones who recommended you at work. Sure. I'll be home early later. - Cook something, ok? - Ok. We'll eat together. - I'm going. - Ok. I'm late. - I love you. - I love you, lock the door. Take care. You have your own room here. It's big, it's all yours! Your Daddy works early so he's not here anymore. We'll call you again later. Your Mama misses you so much. Send me text messages always, ok? I love you Pau, I really love you. - Hey, buddy. - Buddy, what's up? A present from my wife. She arrived yesterday. What is it? Fish paste! Karen and I miss this terribly. From the province? That's specially made by my mother. Thank you. Have you talked to Hatton? Oh, not yet. I will when I see him, I'll tell you about it. Ok, I'm going to work. Ok, thanks again. Joseph, do you have Mr. Corburg's files down here? Just a second. What's that stench? It smells like a morgue down here. I'll be there with you, my friend. Cucumber in plastic, how chic! What an eggplant! Hey! - I knew it, you're Filipino! - What's it to you! How embarrassing, you're a thief! At your age! Pick that up! This is embarrassing. We're returning this. - No way! - What do you mean no way? - Ouch! - Bugger off! Ouch! It was really embarrassing! The first Filipino I meet here is a thief! At an early age! He said, "Bugger off!" What does that mean? "Bugger off" is like "Get lost" or "Go to hell!" That's a cuss word. Why? That's what the little critter screamed at me when I caught him shoplifting. - How rude! - He's a hooligan! What's that? Hooligan to us is like a gangster or a lost boy. Juvenile delinquent. Why didn't you just say "juvenile delinquent"... instead of "hooligan"! Even though they speak English in London... the language is still somewhat different. Like a TV, they call it "telly". - A "lift" is an elevator. - How confusing! And they call me an English teacher back home! You'll memorize it soon. In two months, you'll even speak with an accent. - Here, honey. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Look, it's so cute. It must be fun to ride that. They say when you travel the whole River Thames... you'll see almost all the famous tourist spots in London. They say it's the most romantic thing to do here. Especially at night. Really? Let's ride it! How much do you think is a ticket? - But that includes a bottle of champagne. - No way! I'll buy a postcard instead! - I already bought us. - A postcard? Tickets! For two. For our anniversary. Advanced booking! You and I already have a date. Thank you. The peace of the Lord be with you always. And also with you. Let us offer each other the sign of peace. Peace be with you. Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world... - Hi! - Hi Would you like to join us for a Bible study? Thank you. Don't mingle with them too much, they're maids. - So what? - I don't want you to. What did the Missus say? She got mad at first because of the extra expense. But I told her we deserve it. She said I should've consulted her. It hasn't been a week since the TVarrived and already... I couldn't touch the remote control! Our youngest is also in third grade! I'm so excited! They will finally be here by year's end! Who will look after them while you work? We have a Filipino neighbor. They got their Mother petitioned. Instead of doing nothing, she sidelines as a nanny! Won't you miss teaching, Sarah? Why, do you miss being a doctor? - You're a doctor? - My husband was an ex-doctor. Hey, I'm still a doctor. Once a doctor, always a doctor. Do you miss it? No. I'm happy with my job. How much does a doctor earn in the Philippines? A nurse's salary here is bigger. A senior carer's salary is bigger. It seems Ted's work as a nurse here was the right decision. Buddy, can you pass me the stew? We don't really need this... although it's helpful to know you've taken this course. You see, after six months, it is mandatory... for us to send all recruits to school in the UK... so they get certified. What I like about you is your English is good. It's very hard for us to find carers who can communicate well with the residents. So. You're all set. Do a good job there, Ok? It's tough at the start but you'll get used to it. I'm nervous already. Don't be nervous. Be strong. You should be happy because everything is working according to our plans. Paulo will be happy because we can petition him once we save enough money. That's what I was saying. We'll help each other, right? We can split the household chores. I wash the dishes, you clean the toilet. We can take turns doing laundry. You cook, while I do the grocery. Do you know how to do that? Then I'll just leave money for the grocery. I knew it. Honey, you bought a new TV? This looks expensive! Honey, it's six months to pay with zero interest! I just want a nice TV for my wife! Especially now that you got a job. I want you to relax when you're off-duty. But the old TV worked just fine! Honey, I already bought it. I'm off to work. Where's my kiss? Honey. Congratulations again on your new job. Hi, Sue! This is our quarters. This is Sarah, our new sister. - It's her first day. - Really? This is the shower room. This is where you'll sit them. This is where they receive guests. Visitors may also go up to their rooms if they wish. Sometimes the residents have luncheons here with their visitors. That one has many visitors. That's because he's new here. The longer they stay here the less their family visits. That's Lily. In my long service here, I've never seen her with a single visitor. I'll introduce you. Good day, Lily! This is our new sister, Sarah. Lily's easy to take care. Hello Lily, my name is Sarah. I'm going to take care of you from now on. We always work in pairs. You can't work by yourself. In case I'm not your partner, my tip to you is... Choose a carer with a big body so you can carry patients easily. Kate, can you give me a hand here please? I can't, I have a bad back. That's it? "Hold the chair" was all she could help? She has a wrestler's body for nothing? She thinks she's special. It's because she's Briton that's why she's bossing you around. Don't let her boss you. Is it filled? Very filled. Remove it so we can give her a bath. What? Remove it so we can wash her ass. Go on and wipe the ass. We still a lot of work to do. I can't do it. Make yourself do it. I can't. Are you giving up now? You're already here. This is it, no backing out. Are you talking about me? Oh no Lily, we're just talking about... Pounds. Pounds? Pounds. Pounds. Pounds. Ok Lily, open your mouth now, sweetheart. Come on my good girl. You need to eat this, it's really yummy. Very good job. That's my girl. Is that you, Mummy? It's Mummy, Darling. Why did you leave me? Paulo, take care of your things... they're expensive! I couldn't even call you often because it's expensive. Just to say I miss you, I love you... I didn't know you have problems. Now I have to recompute my budget... Do you always pray? It's nice to still catch you. How was work? Ok as usual. You're late. There's food in the fridge. Heat it up in the microwave. Ok. - Bye, I love you. - I love you. Number 65. Do you have a "65" in "O"? You got one, girl. I think she'll beat me, let's see... Nigel! What are you doing? I want to swim! No, no! Nigel, no! It's time to sleep now, Nigel. Karen, it's Lily! She's dead? Debbie, don't be so morbid. Sarah, can you do me a favor? Can you give Lily's family a call? I'll make arrangements for the undertaker. Resign? You just started, and you're thinking about resigning. It wouldn't be so bad if I start looking for a different job. I can be a maid or a nanny... Anything, just not at the nursing home. Sarah, what's the problem? I told you it will be like this, the hours are long... We barely see each other. Don't add up to our problems. It's only been weeks and you're tired already. All you need is sleep. I get affected. It's hard to take care of people who are only waiting to die. Distance yourself from them. You shouldn't get affected because they're not your relatives! We can get by on your salary, right? If we cut our expenses. No. Honey? Listen to me first. Honey! I'm ok, Mommy... I won the Math Championship... ...Lola brought rice cakes. I wish she brought pizza ha ha... Hey, stop it! What do you think you're doing? Get out! Go home! These kids... Get your hands off me! This kid... Look at that, your head is bleeding! I'm taking you to the hospital. Come on. You're not my mother! Well, I'm glad that I'm not! If you were my son... you'll be getting more than a blackeye from me! If you were in school, you wouldn't have been beaten up. How may I help you? I'm looking for my husband. He works here as a nurse. Can you have him paged please? Is he on duty right now? Yes, his name is Theodore Gonzales. Are you sure he's on duty? Because we don't have his name on the roster. We don't even have his name on the off-duty list. But he's a nurse here. I'm sorry, can you check again please? I'm sorry. I'm certain, that's what the computer records say. Michelle, can I borrow you? Excuse me. Thank you. Sean, what did you get yourself into this time? Even my work got interrupted. I had to leave your brother at the neighbor's. Mrs? - Are you Sarah? - Yes. Thank you. I'm sorry about my son. He takes after his criminal father. That's not a problem, Mrs. Norma. Norma Fielding. Thank you so much again. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. It's Ok, I'll be going now. Yes, see you in church! And cheers! Cheers. Teddy! I'm not a nurse. I'm a health care assistant. Now you know. They gave me an evaluation twice, and twice they failed me. Even though I got high marks at adaptation, skills, knowledge... I deserved to pass. They want me to kiss the boss' ass, like the others. Ted, why didn't you transfer to a different hospital? If only I could, Sarah. I'm bound by their contract. They brought me here. They have no use for me as a nurse, so this is where they put me. A health care assistant. In other words, a slave boy. Why didn't you tell me? I thought I'll have it settled once you got here. But I think they're making me wait for nothing. I don't want people from back home to know what I do. It's humiliating. That's why I don't want you to resign. Because I'm only this. There's nothing wrong with your job. Don't pity me. Reserve it for your patients. Nigel! Honey? Yes? I got my pay. Good. Sarah, could you send some money to the province just for now? Charge it to your account, including Paulo's money. Honey, can we talk? About what? I was calculating our expenses. It turns out that our savings are small. It will take a while before we can get Paulo... if we don't save enough in the bank for "show money". What do you want to say? Nothing, except maybe we should spend more wisely. Even the small things could help. We could eat out less often. Or refrain from buying unnecessary things. Like your beer, maybe? Or your cigarettes? Do you know your daily pack of cigarettes costs... Wouldn't we rather send that money to Paulo? Then I also shouldn't watch TV anymore! Do you want us to stop using the electricity? Let's be in the dark! Do you want me to turn off the heater? That's not what I mean, you know that. You've got your first pay check, and you're already dictating what you want! Ted, your temper these days... I have no intention to argue with you. The problem with you is... you earn a little and you think our entire livelihood is being squandered! Don't I have the right to speak? Do you want me watch silently, as we grow old working for nothing? Ted, half of what we earn goes to rent! Now you're blaming the place! Where do you want me to sleep? In the subway? Ted, if you don't change your attitude, there's no point in even coming here! We changed countries, but we're still the same! Teddy. After that, pick up lab results from 506. Make sure they're complete. They should be ready by now. Sorry. One of our residents, Mr. Morgan is requesting a new personal sister. One who converses in English fluently. Sir, may I ask what happened to his carer? Svetlana? Well, the most she could say, was yes and no. They didn't get along too well. So I thought I'd reassigned you to take over her post. Sir, this Mr. Morgan, is he difficult to deal with? Well he doesn't bite, if that worries you. He's here to recuperate from an operation. The hours will be longer than you're used to... but you will be compensated accordingly. It's a substantially higher rate, than you're used to... if that's Ok with you? Of course sir, when do I start? Oh I can speak and understand English very well... so you don't need to worry about that. That's good to hear. Where are you from, Sarah? The Philippines. I've heard great things about the beaches there. How do you say it... Boracay? Boracay! It's really beautiful. Maybe when your father gets better you should go, the two of you. I don't think he'll ever be fit enough again to travel. He insists he can take care of himself though. He's been living alone now, for quite some time. Until the first heart attack came along. He's been in and out of hospital for the last two years. While my sister and I... We're both very busy. Surely somebody should be here, looking after him all the time- Mr. Morgan, you don't really have to explain. I'm sorry, I better get going. Just introduce yourself to him, when he wakes up. Make sure you coordinate with the nurses... I'm sure you know what to do. We'll take good care of him, Mr. Morgan. And one more thing. You can call me David. That's Mr. Morgan. Alright, David. Cheers. Hello, Audrey. Going back to your room? Don't touch me. I can get into bed the same way, I went out of it. Without your help. Sir, your soup. You don't have to feed me. I know where my mouth is. Just put it there and I'll have it when I'm hungry. Are you still there? I'll call for you if and when I need you. Now please get out of my room. - But sir- - Get out of my room! Your appeal is no good, man. They said you failed your adaptation twice. What else do I have to prove? I'm smarter than those morons at the hospital. I have more brains. Brains is not the only criteria in adaptation. You have to know how to get along with others. Your attitude- Hatton said, you complain too much. Towards your superiors and your co-nurses. That's why you don't pass. They said if you want to appeal go directly to RCN. RCN? Man, I came here to be a nurse not a nurse aid. I don't want to be a slave. Why are you telling me? What was I before? I'm a doctor. Here, I'm a nurse. There's no progress in the Philippines, that's why we work here. We work here because the Britons couldn't stand their dirty jobs. If you want to complain, do it back home in Malacaang Palace. Honey. Did you drink? Just a little. You're off-duty already? What time is it? Come, I brought stuffed chicken. I'll serve it while it's hot. Let's eat together. You said we should save money. Why did you spend for that? Just a little celebration. I got my pay today. They gave me an increase of 75 pounds. You were promoted? I was assigned at the special wing, where the patients are rich. So they gave me a raise. Come on. Good. Congratulations. Come on, let's eat together! I have a stomach ache. Go ahead. Let me sleep. The Lord be with you. And also with you. Lift up your hearts. We lift them up to the Lord. What a rotten life! I work the whole day, and when I get home, there's nothing to eat! You didn't eat? Didn't you forbid me from eating out? Wait, I'll cook for you. Never mind, I'll sleep it off. I said I'll cook, just wait. I said never mind! I will still cook! If you don't want to eat, then don't! You're not the only one who's hungry! Eat by yourself! What do you really want from me? It's not like I went sightseeing the whole day! If I can do everything around here, I will! But I only have one body! You're not the only one, who gets exhausted! Alright, you're more exhausted! You win! Hey, Sarah. Karen is still on duty... No, I came to see you. Come in. No, I don't want to be any trouble. I will only take a short time. Joseph, perhaps... Perhaps you can talk to Hatton again for Teddy? Sarah, I'll be frank with you. I talked to Hatton several times already. He said Teddy will really have a hard time with his appeal. You know how it is. Oh my God! Oh my God... Broken bones... Breathing... Heartbeat... Oh my God! What do I do? Help! Help! We found these under the bed in between two mattresses. He's not been taking his medications which means... his veins have started to constrict. Don't worry, I'll be seeing him regularly anyway. Thank you, Doctor. Sarah. Thank you so much for saving my father's life. If it weren't for your presence of mind, he'd be dead now. David, we just did all that we could. We're so grateful to you. I promise, I won't forget what you did for him. For us. Mr. Morgan? Would you like me to get you something from the kitchen? You didn't touch your food again. Sir, you have to eat, if you want to get better. Your doctor says- I don't care what the bloody doctor says! Now get out of here, and take your bloody food with you! Go on, get out! With all due respect, Mr. Morgan. If you're not happy with my services, you could always have me replaced. If you want to just lie there being miserable and surly all the time... then that is your choice. But please do not make me look bad or inefficient because I am not. How dare you speak to me in this manner? I dare because this job means so much to me! You have no idea what I've had to give up to get this... this thankless job! Do you know that I had to leave my son back home? But I'm doing this for him because, I want him to be somebody. I just want him to have a better chance in life. I care about my job, sir. I care about you. I don't deserve to be treated like this. No one does. So again, Mr. Morgan sir, if you want to have me replaced... you're free to do so. What's going on here? I heard her, she was screaming at my father! Nobody speaks to my father that way. That was totally unacceptable behavior. I apologize for that, Miss Morgan. I'll talk to her and make sure it never happens again. Talk to her? Is that all you will do? What do you suggest I do? If you can't fire her, I want you to replace her. Alright, I'll see what I can do. It's alright, Mr. Hartley. What do you mean it's alright? - Mr. Hartley, sir. - It's alright, Sarah. Everything's fine now. Carry on. I told you so. Are you wearing gloves? No, sir. I'm sorry, I was just looking at your books. Are you wearing gloves? What, sir? Put on some gloves, if you're going to touch the books. There's a pair of gloves in the drawer. I'm really sorry, Mr. Morgan. I was just curious, I'll put it back. Wear the gloves. Then come here and show me, what book you've chosen. "Tess of the D'Urbervilles" Thomas Hardy. Interesting choice. Should I put it back now sir? No. That's the first edition you're holding, you know? You know what that book's worth? Sir, maybe I should just put it back now. No. I'm asking you. Do you know what that book's worth? How much is it? I don't know either. But it should be enough to get me a decent meal. Which is more than I can say for what your bloody kitchen is serving up. The food here is going to kill me. You should have left me to die, you know? Not on my watch, Mr. Morgan. I know. You had a lot to say for yourself the other day... when I bit your head off, didn't you? But you made a lot of sense. Pull up a chair and read me the story of poor Tess. You chose the book. Let's see if it means anything to you. By the way... What do you call yourself? Sarah. My name is Sarah. Carry on, Sarah. "Phase the first:" "The Maiden". Hi Sarah, how are you? I'm good. You're leaving so soon? We cannot stay. Sean's father wants us to go home right away. He's not my father! Be quiet! I'm sorry, we have to go. How can you behave that way after coming from church? Church has no effect on you! Hope is limitless. Love is boundless. And the kite will fly in the rain. And if in case aspirations fall. What matters is I learned to risk. To persevere as long as able. My heart, spirit, mind and flesh. Even when I'm anxious. Dreaming alone. I'm here taking my chances. Even though the future is uncertain. I won't say no. I'm someone who learned. To fly a kite in the rain. Sarah's here. Honey, come here. Friends, this is my wife Sarah. These guys are my batchmates. Norman! My idol! He's an engineer in Manila. Now he's the best at using the catheter! You son of a bitch! I'll- Billy, my man! City boy! Yuppie boy! How's your enema? You guys are so good at what you do! So good- I'm really sorry, Sarah. Come on, let's go. Leave me alone here, I'm ok... Leave me here, it's ok... Go on! You can't stay here. Come on, Ted. - Lie down outside... - I said leave me here. What happened to you? I don't understand you anymore. That's my wife, Jenny. She died when David was still a boy. This other lady, sir? My friend Barbara. We met just after retirement. She died a couple of years ago, just before my first heart attack. I'm so sorry to hear that. They're like a couple of bookends those two. My two greatest friends. I miss Barbara. Terribly. We used to spend a lot of time in the city. We can still do that if you want. Is that possible? Mr. Morgan sir, you're a resident here, not a prisoner. I'm sure it can be arranged. In the meantime, why don't you let these magic pills work their wonders? You look terrible, Sarah. You can do with a rest from this place, you know? I'm alright, sir. Hey. Did you shoplift again? No, I bought this. I even got change. So you're loitering? No, I came from school. I just don't want to go home yet. I'll be asked to take care of my brother again. Where are you going? I want to buy stuff, because I feel like cooking. What will you cook? I feel like... adobo... binagoongan... Are you a good cook? My feeling is yes. When is your son coming? It might take a while. Is he nice? Of course. But like you, he gets moods. When he gets here make friends with him, ok? Don't be a bad influence. No problem! I'll take care of him when he gets here. Can I have some more rice? You eat like a tramp. You might get indigestion. What happened? She's lost a lot of blood. A lorry lost its breaks, and sideswiped her on the M4. What happened to her? A car accident. It looks like she's having, an acute abdomen. I need a work up. I need stats, ultrasound... Shouldn't we take her to the OR? Her abdomen is tender. What? We are losing time. We should start exploring her abdomen, instead of performing ancillary procedures. How dare you go against my orders? We need those tests as basis for our procedure! Her heart rate is shooting up, blood pressure is too low. Please let's take her to the OR! You impressed me there. The doctor is overworked that's why he can't think clearly. He didn't know what was coming to him. His face became pale! It's a good thing he listened to me. If not, poor baby. Joseph? You're wanted at the head nurse's office. What? You are firing me? I'm afraid so. On what grounds? For saving a life? For insubordination. Are you serious? You embarrassed Dr. Black in front of all those people... including his residents in training. But it was a wrong call! It was still his call, the doctor's call. It's the only call that matters, no matter what. We would've lost the patient if it wasn't for my intervention. It doesn't matter. Whether they live or die, it is always the doctor's accountability and never yours. Because you are only a nurse. Just a nurse? I just saved you from a possible lawsuit! I know you used to be a doctor. But let me be the first to remind you, that you certainly aren't anymore. Not in this hospital. And not in this country. This is crazy. You are crazy! You arrogant son of a bitch! You don't even know what it takes to be a doctor anymore! You can piss off! You're not a doctor! You're not a doctor here! You're a nurse! Nurse! Now he's not even a nurse. What is he now? Nothing. We can't do anything about it anymore. Give it a rest, Ok? He ruined all our plans. So now it's up to me again. It's always me. How can we save for "show money" to get our kid? He's not thinking! He can look for another job, right? I'm so tired, Sarah. I wish I could just be with them. When I come home I want to feel a little happiness, you know? I understand you. Joseph got his karma. Ted? He's our friend. They helped us with a lot. Yes, Karen did. But Joseph? He can't be trusted. If it weren't for Karen, he'd be trash here. Karen is the one with the smarts. You didn't even read the note I left you. What do you want me to do? You know I don't have money to send to Mama. Could you take care of it again? Ted, I was thinking. We'd be better off if someone shared rent with us. You're getting a boarder? Ted... I just want to be practical. It will help if someone rented here. Do you want to turn this place into a pig pen? It's up to you. Happy anniversary. That's a nice shop over there. Come, Sarah. There are many good things in this place. Old things! - Sarah? - Catch! It's expensive! Mr. Morgan, look! An old one about the Philippines. Ours was the only group to put your People Power Revolution on the front page. You published this? Yes, among other tabloids and magazines. Have a look, my name's on page two. Wow. Would you like us to buy this, sir? I'm sure I put a copy somewhere. David and I used to make kites like those. And then drive into the countryside to fly them. Maybe David or Margaret could take you? Maybe. Can't you see you have to sell that property? It's all you have left, Dad. I just want to put everything in order before you- Before I what? Go on. Say it, Margaret, say it. Before I what? You're impossible. It's not good for you to get upset. You know that, don't you sir? It's funny. You never know how your children are going to turn out. One day they're helpless little things, who depend on you for everything. The next day, they're telling you how to run your life. Like you stopped having a mind of your own. I know how hard you work for your boy, Sarah. I hope the same thing doesn't happen to you. It's hot! Delicious! Thank you, Auntie. If you want more, it's here. Why is that kid here? I saw him outside. I let him in. Better than roaming around. He should be in school. Let him be. He's rude. He can't even say "Good morning". Why are you so hot-tempered? Don't you have work? It's my day off. Do you want coffee? Ok. I wanted to ask your permission. Mr. Morgan invited me to the countryside with him. Hartley said ok. It will be for one week. Is it ok with you? Your rate should be higher. Of course. Ditas! Come in. Teddy, it's Ditas. Hi, Teddy! Can I bring my stuff in? Sure. Do you need help? No, it's alright. What is she doing here? Didn't I tell you? She's our new boarder. She will occupy Paulo's room. Why didn't you tell me? We haven't been seeing each other. Ditas is fine. She agreed with the price, plus three months down payment. You said it was up to me. But why her? Where should I put this? Your Saint is large. It's a gift from Prague. Put it there for now. My cooking... Move. Give me that! Stop it! - You're hurting me! - Give me that! You good-for-nothing... You know, you're sick in the head! You can't do anything right... and now you're destroying other people's things. Why are you here anyway? Go home! Teddy, he's a child! What child? This is not a child, this is a criminal! Go home! Teddy, oh God... I don't want to see your face in here again! Teddy! Sean! Sean! Here comes Mama Mary! This is a new house. Welcome. Haven't you had enough? Looks like you're really asking for it, aren't you? I'm not afraid of you! I can take all of you down! You're asking for it, squirt! Let's get him! Sean? You have a visitor. Drew, it's time to eat. Come in. - I'll be feeding him. - Thank you. This is where you sleep? Auntie Sarah... Sean? Please tell Teddy I'm sorry. I'm sorry I broke his remote control. - I didn't mean to. - I know. I know, Sean. I don't want to be separated from my Mama. My stepfather said, he's sending me back to the Philippines. Son, don't think about that now, Ok? Go back to sleep. It's important you get well first. Go to sleep, please. Go to sleep. Good day, sir. Nice to see you again, sir. I'm still alive. Oh you look very well sir. Thank you. Sarah. This is Yanco and this is his wife Blanca. They've been here since I was a boy. Nice to meet you. Welcome, my dear. Welcome to my home. It's nice to be back. It's gorgeous here! There are no neighbors. It's like in a fairy tale. And the sun is bright. Unlike in the city where sunshine seems illegal. Wait a moment. Miss Sarah, dinner is served. Thank you. Did you hear that? "Dinnah is sehved". Here you are, sir. You've excelled yourself. I missed your cooking. Enjoy your dinner, sir. Bon apetit. Good, sir. Well done. No. That doesn't count. See that? My paper. The London Journal. Very successful publication in its day. Sir, may I ask what is that? Do you know what this is? This is one of the kites that Little David and I used to make. I remember this one. We couldn't get it off the ground, no matter what we did. Thank you, Sarah. Your welcome, sir. Did you want to talk to your father? I wanted to talk to you. Would you care for a cup of tea? Sarah, I'm so grateful to you for spending these days with us. I can't see myself looking after Dad the way you do. Or my sister for that matter. I can't even picture Margaret holding a bedpan. I see. No, it's not what I meant. Please Sarah, I didn't mean to offend you. I admire what you do. Really. I just don't think it's for everybody, your line of work, I mean. I do it because it pays a lot more than my work back home. And you're very good at it. You know, with Dad I feel... You and him, you're quite close. You're friends. You go out, you read to him, you eat together. God, you even make him laugh, can you believe it? You make grumpy old Mr. Morgan laugh. I could barely make him smile. He hates me. No, he doesn't hate you. He doesn't have to say it out loud, but I can sense it. I can feel his disappointment. I never quite lived up to his expectations, you know? I wasn't outstanding at school... I wasn't good in business. I wasn't even a good husband. In short, I wasn't him. Now that I know he's about ready to go, I realize it's my last chance to make up for whatever's been lost. It's not too late, David. It's never too late. Ok Sarah, after three! One, two, three... Go! I told you it would fly! I told you I'd get it up! I'm almost at the hospital. My shift is starting. Are you eating well? Yes. I can't talk long, I'm almost at work. Ok. Honey, I love you. Ok, bye. Are you enjoying it here in the countryside? Don't you think father will be better off in a hospital than here? It's his choice to come here. It's his choice to bring her here, you mean? Look, Margaret, if you have a problem with this... why don't you speak to him yourself? Because you're with them. You can never tell what goes on inside a woman's head. You should know that by now, David. How do you know she doesn't have anything on her mind? Like what? Like getting the old man to marry her. For heaven's sake, you're paranoid. He's 75 years old! Come on, David. It wouldn't be the first time, a Filipino maid... ends up marrying a rich, dying old man. She's not a maid. Maid, carer, caregiver, whatever. Yanco, please give this to David. What should I tell Master David? Just please make sure he gets this. Thank you, Yanco. Blanca, thank you. Not for you. David Morgan called. He's very apologetic about what happened. He wanted to make sure you keep your job. He told me it wasn't your fault. They're to blame. Everything's fine. Thank you, sir. Ted... Teddy... You went drinking again. Why did you drink, when you know you have work? I don't have work. Even if it's your day off, you shouldn't drink if you can't handle it. I said I don't have work. I don't have work anymore. Sarah, I've been AWOL for two weeks. I give up. I don't want to be here anymore. Let's go back to the Philippines. Nothing will happen to us here. Our fortune isn't here. We should stop torturing ourselves. Let's go home, Honey. Why don't you talk to Hatton? I can't beg anymore! What do you want me to do? Kneel down at his feet? Sarah, isn't it clear yet? The opportunity for me here is gone. Ted... What will be there for us back home? Let's try it in the U. S... In New Zealand, even in Iraq... But not here. My good fortune isn't here. Sarah. David, what are you doing here? I read your note. You have every right to be upset and leave. I thought I'd take a chance and see if, I could convince you to come back. What for? So your sister can insult me again? She won't bother us again, I assure you. David, I know what Margaret thinks of me. I've had enough. She's got what she wanted. Dad has agreed to sell the house. Sarah... My father is asking for you. You don't have to take care of him. He just wants you there. He wants to see you. You know he's not doing very well. You don't have to look after him. He just needs a friend. Please I beg you. Sarah, I'm not going without you. I don't want to disappoint him anymore. You're going out? I was about to wake you. Where are you going? I need to visit someone. I thought you don't like it there anymore? You haven't learned. I need to do this. I can't just walk away from my job. Is that you, Sarah? Yes sir, it's me. Hi, Mr. Morgan. Thank you for coming. I asked for you because... I haven't got much time left. Oh sir... I wanted to tell you something. Remember you said to me... You had a thankless job? Sometimes, when you least expect it... Someone will come into your life. And make you feel less lonely... Less alone. For me... you were that person. You care for people You give them what they've lost in life down the years. Their dignity... And hope. And joy. And even fun. There are not many jobs in the world that can top that. So... Sarah Gonzales... I say to you... Thank you. Job well done. It's so nice to see you. You too, sir. Lovely to see you. It's still flying after all these years. Get a bit of height down there. Looking good, David. - See it Sarah? - Yup. Get some height. Let some line out. David? You have a phone call. It's Margaret. - Here, give me the kite. - You'll have to take it. - Can you manage it? - Off you go. - Got it? - I'm alright. I haven't done this for a long time. Look at that kite fly! - Make it go higher? - Of course, sir! Higher! Oh my golly! Oh no, it's crash landing! Rescue it then! You may have to climb a tree! I'm rescuing it, sir. Dad wanted you to have this. Thank you. So I guess this is goodbye? No. I'll be keeping in touch. Bye, David. Don't leave, Sarah. You're a good woman, Sarah. What you've done for our family, you couldn't possibly imagine. Please. Take care. Are we going home, Sarah? Yes, we're going home. Joseph's not home? He's in a job interview. He's choosing between three jobs. A hardware, laundry, and hotel. He was already being hired by a drugstore. I didn't allow him! A drugstore is still related to medicine! I said no way! Our husbands are so much trouble. These are for my kids. Are you sure it's ok? Yes, we don't have much to bring home anyway. Do you think we'll see each other again? Of course! When you come fetch your kids pretty soon. Yes please, God... Please let it be soon! Does Paulo know you're going home? He'll be happy. His Daddy and I will be back. We'll be together again. Like old times. He will understand, right? You're still alive? You know what they say: Bad grass don't die easily. I heard from my Mama's churchmates, that you're leaving soon. I came here to say goodbye. Come inside. No thanks, I have things to do. What, you'll hold up a bank? My homework! You mean you're rehabilitated? So soon? I'm a new person. It's my second life. You crack me up. You know, my feet are healed. I can walk again. You can roam the streets again. No, I go straight home. I don't want Mama to be alone. No one helps her in taking care of my half-breed brother. Half-breed. So... This is goodbye? Goodbye. Take care, ok? Bye, Sean. Be good. Sean! Bugger off! I will miss you, little critter. Don't forget me, ok? My Dear Sarah... You've always said that everything you do... is for your husband and your son. They are lucky men indeed to have you as a wife and mother. And I was lucky to have you as my carer. But I want you never to forget... that you are a person too, Sarah. And it is vital that you live your own life. And do things that make you feel alive. If I have one wish... It is that you grow old happy and without regrets. Goodbye, my lovely Sarah. Your grumpy old friend, William Morgan. I'll bring this downstairs. I can't help you later. Ditas, it's ok. The taxi isn't here yet. And Teddy can do it. When will your new flatmates arrive? In two days. You'll be alone all that time. It's ok. Once they're here, I'll never run out of company. Six of us will share the rent. Six? Yes, for minimal cost. I'll go ahead. Happy trip. - Thank you, Ditas. - Thank you too. I'll pray for you both. Thank you. Sarah, come on, we can't be late. What now, Sarah? We should hurry. Faster, we're late. I'm not going with you. What? I don't want to go with you. What are you up to now? Ted, why are we going back to the Philippines? What is waiting for us there? We have no savings, we have no jobs. There's nothing to go back to! Ted, how will I face my son, when he asks me... "Ma, what did you do in London?" What will I answer? I had my picture taken? What are you saying? Ted, it's simple. If you failed... why do you have to drag me down with you? I want to know why! Because I'm your husband. Where I am is where you should be. Not anymore, Teddy. Even here, I don't have a husband to go home to. You don't care about me. Ted, I'm tired of coming to your aid all the time. I take care of other people, but who's taking care of me? No one. Whether you like it or not, we're leaving. No. I can carry this myself. Let me go, Ted. Sarah, please. Let's start over. I already started over, Ted. Even without you. Plans and dreams aren't enough. We have to work for our dreams, Ted. We have to struggle. I achieved something here. I achieved something long ago. But you didn't see it. Why didn't you notice? You didn't see the value. You can't leave me. Ted, I can. I'm done. I'm done being your wife. Is this your first time in London? No, it's not. Why are we afraid to jump into the uncertain? How will we know what's waiting for us, if we don't step into the dark? Without a first step, how can we move forward? Mr. Morgan was right. If fear overtakes us... how can we even begin to wrestle with life?
