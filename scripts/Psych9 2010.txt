Uh, collating all the ER records so they can be shipped to storage, then copying policies and procedures and the templates for the QA forms. So you've done this before? Well, the last two ERs I worked at were closed down. At this rate there won't be any emergency rooms left. Well, in this case it's the whole hospital. The building is being torn down as part of the land redevelopment. Can I ask you something? Why do you want to work the night shift? Well, my husband-- he drives a cab and he works nights, so if I work days then we never get to see each other. Besides, you know, I kind of need the peace and quiet. I've worked at the ER the last five years, so... And you're not worried about being here alone, you know, in light of what's been happening? God, Jim, are you trying to scare her off? Oh no, that's fine really. It's okay. Well, I'm sorry about the state of the E.R., but there will be a 24-hour guard on duty upfront, okay? Okay. Welcome to St. John's. Thank you. So once each one's been labeled and collated, ust mark the front of the box like so and stack them in the laundry room. Once we finish all the paperwork, we'll get to work on copying procedure forms and what-have-you. It's not exactly nursing, but what are you gonna do? How long have you worked here? I worked lCU at County and then ER here for two years. But I don't know, I never liked this building. It's too old. Nothing worked properly. Beth tells me you were born at this hospital. Yeah, I grew up around here. Oh, so then your charts must be buried somewhere here in all of this. Do you want a coffee or something? I'm gonna get a coffee. No, you know what? I'd better be getting home. I normally catch the bus an hour before you're due on. I just wanted to wait around and show you the ropes. Anyway, if you have any questions, Beth said she'd be stopping by later. - Okay. - Okay? Bye. These files are endless. By the way, one of the psych ward doctors got the same job as you, so he'll be up on the fifth floor collating the psych ward records. So you're not gonna be here alone. Okay. I'm gonna get back to County. Beth, seriously, thank you, really. Good night. Um, can l--? I can't believe they closed down this hospital as well. Do you know that the nearest E.R. is now over 1 6 miles from here? And that place is swamped. Health care in this country-- it's going to the dogs. I don't think you should smoke in here. Why? Because of all the sick people? Uh, I'm just kidding. It's plastic. I'm trying to quit. Is there something I can help you with, Detective? We found a woman's body over on 9th Street. Another one? I was just wondering if maybe you'd heard or seen anything suspicious. You think it's the same guy-- the one that the papers are calling the Nighthawk or something? Well, we don't know. You know, I never understood that. Why pretend a serial killer is some kind of animal or a comic-book hero? It's ridiculous. Well, it's publicity. "Man Kills Woman"-- it just doesn't cut it as a headline anymore. If we want the media's help, we need to jazz it up a little bit. You know, a lot of women around here-- they're not wearing their jewelry anymore. Why is that? They don't want to be next. They don't want to encourage him. Hmm, well, that's not why I'm not wearing my wedding band. Is that-- is that blood? Nothing serious, I hope. Just a paper cut. Well, you're in the right place. Thank you. Did I frighten you? I didn't mean to. You must be... - Roslyn. - Roslyn. Roslyn, right. - I'm Dr. Clement. - Hello. Looks like these files belong down here rather than on the fifth floor. I just wanted to let you know I was in the building so as not to startle you, but I seem to have failed miserably in that regard. No, Beth told me you would be here, so... Yes, this place can be a little unsettling at times. Yeah, I'm-- I'm just starting to figure that out. Should I take that personally? No, I'm sorry. No, I didn't mean-- I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I don't know if you've met the security guard yet, but he is-- yeah. And I've been hearing some noises. Really? What sort of noises? Do you mind my asking? Like singing. Singing? I think I'm being a little bit paranoid. I'm sorry. No no no no, that's quite all right. I'll tell you what: why don't I take a quick look around just to make sure? Would that make you feel better? A little, yeah. Okay, all right. Thank you. Nothing here. So you're-- you're British? Mm-hmm. I came over on a foreign-exchange program as a med student and, well, never went back. How is it you don't have Iike an assistant or someone like me to handle all the paperwork up there? Well, the psychiatric department doesn't quite have the budget of E.R., so some of us doctors agreed to a tradeoff. And also some of the files are a little bit sensitive, if you know what I mean. That's it. Seems to be all clear. I'm sure it was just music from a passing car or something that you heard. I'm sure, yeah. Um, if that security guard is bothering you, you know, I can always talk to the administrator. - Oh no. - No, I mean, it's not a problem. You know, just knowing that there's someone else in the building, I feel much better. Okay, well, if you hear any more strange noises, you know where to find me. - Thank you. - Okay. Cole, are you home? It's Cole. Leave a message. Hey, I thought you'd be home. I guess you're putting in some overtime. Anyways, listen, if I'm asleep when you get in, do not wake me, because I'm beat. Um, see you for lunch maybe. Okay, bye. Hey! What the hell happened to this place? Where is everybody? What are you talking about? This place has been closed down for weeks. And the closest ER now? County. Wait a minute. What happened to her? The Nighthawk. - Hey. - You scared me. Sorry. Are you all right? Hi. Hey. The guard let me in. So you got a job in a bomb shelter. Wow. Um, hungry? It's your favorite. I missed you the last couple days. I really missed you. Cole, Cole, stop it. Are you okay? Damn. Where were you last night? Um... oh, I worked a double and-- wait for it-- I went to the gym. Told you. What, at that time? Well yeah. I'm downtown. The gym's downtown. I gotta take the opportunity when I can, you know. God damn. Hello, goodbye. Got a fare and gotta go, gotta go. Um, are you gonna be okay? It is what it is. Mm, okay. Love you. Hello? " And someone's gonna cry " " 'Cause in my heart " " I finally " " Made up my mind " " I can't say " " It's not been good " " Or that you're to blame " " I just know " " It's time to leave " " Before love turns to hate " " In my heart " " I finally made up my-- " - Hello. - Hello. My husband-- he dropped this off and I thought you might be hungry. Thank you. I'm starving. It's not warm or anything, but... Oh, that's quite all right. I happen to love cold pizza. It's what I lived on in college. There's still a coffee machine here if you'd like a cup, - or tea if you prefer. - Oh no. No? Are you sure? Just one cup, nice and warm. - Okay. - Okay. - One cup. - Coffee? Coffee, yeah. How is it going down there? Slowly. No more strange noises though? I'm sorry, l-- I don't mean to pry, but is everything okay? Yeah. Nothing you want to talk about? You mean, like therapy? No, actually I meant more like two people who have a very monotonous task ahead of them simply having a chat while they work. Did you hear that? Hmm? Oh yeah well, it's an old building. God, we must be nuts to work in here at night. Yes well, we try not to use words like "nuts" up here on the fifth floor. What words do you suggest we use? Oh, I don't know. Let's see... "acculturation difficulty" might sum it up better. It means trouble adapting to a new environment. I think "nuts" sounds better. Yeah, I think you might be right. Can I ask you something, Dr. Clement? Irvin, please. Irvin. What are those baths in the room next door used for? Well, those haven't been used in years. They were supposed to calm down restless patients. Ros, check this out. Whew. It says he had a scalpel pushed through his skull, but it didn't kill him. It took him four days to die. What? Babe, will you put those back, please? All right. - Oh wow. - What? This is wild. Check these out. She's a victim of domestic abuse. Cops took these. This is brutal, so rough. I don't know how you look at this all night, I swear to God. - Okay, you're spilling. - I'm sorry. You're spilling food everywhere. Jesus. This is my work. Sorry. Can I turn on the TV? Yeah. ...fears that the woman found brutally murdered in an abandoned warehouse last night is the latest victim of the Nighthawk Killer. Rachel Kaufman, a mother of three young children was on her way home from her shift at the Lucky Star diner. Police believe that she was murdered between the hours of and are appealing to anyone who was in the downtown area last night to come forward and reveal that information. Weren't you downtown last night-- probably about that time, huh? Yeah, I guess I was. Damn. What were you doing there again? Partying. Honey, I was picking up a fare. What do you think? Right in the industrial area? I don't ask what they're doing. I just pick them up, take their money and run, you know? Did you tell the police? Tell the police what? Uh, I don't know, that your passenger might have been the killer, Cole. What did he look like? I don't know. It was a bullshit call. It was a no-show. Really? Yeah really. And you know what? I hate that, because whose time gets wasted? Whose money gets wasted? Mine, that's who. Yeah well, I still think you should report it, babe. She was hacked to pieces, Cole. She had three children. Jesus. Fortune cookie? Babe. What's wrong? The fucking cab broke down again. Are you surprised? Where? The other side of the freeway. You ran from the other side of the freeway? By the way, I'm just curious-- your cell doesn't work anymore? You don't pick up your messages, what? Oh no, I'm-- I was upstairs. Oh. Were you talking to your doctor friend you told me about? Yeah. Oh. Well, maybe it'd be a good time for me to meet him now. What do you think? I'm tired. Let's go home. No no no. It'll only be a minute. Come on, I'd like to meet him. Come on, honey. Cole. It's just here, right? The doctor's on the fifth floor? I'm tired and I want to go home. I'm tired too, babe. I just want to meet your friend, that's all. What, it's not working now or what? 'Cause we can take the stairs. That's fine too. Let's go home. I'm tired. Let's go. All right. Let's go home. How's that feel? I can't, not now. I said no. It's not all this again, is it, Ros? 'Cause I thought we were past all this. Are you listening to me? I'm really not sure how else we're supposed to make a baby, hon. See? You wrote it yourself-- "Days we have sex." Today is the day. Listen to me! You're hurting me. What do you think you're doing to me? I thought we were okay, hon. But here we are-- the same shit over and over and over again. Get over it. Jesus fucking Christ! It's not my fucking fault we can't have kids. Fuck! I mean, you must know how it is-- working all night and sleeping all day. I never get a chance to see my friends. I don't know who else to talk to. Yeah. Well, you can always talk to me. I mean, you know that, Roslyn. Yeah. The door in my dream-- what do you think it means? What do you think it means? I think it's just a stupid dream. What are you writing? I mean... Nothing. Just some-- having some thoughts. Um, Roslyn, if the gynecologists have told you that there's no physical reason for you not to be able to conceive a child, then the problem is most likely psychosomatic-- in your mind. Do you follow? And I think the reason for that Iies beyond the dream door. So it's up to you to open it. Let's-- let's talk a little bit more about your family. You mentioned that-- that your parents died when you were a child. How did that happen? No no, I don't want to talk about that. - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Whenever you feel ready. Cole, have you seen my keys? My keys-- where the hell are my keys? Excuse me. Where's your ring? Where are my keys, God damn it? Maybe if you calmed down, you'd find them. I keep losing things. Hey. All right, what? Do you want me to get up? Do you want me to help you look for them? No, I don't want to lose my job, okay? Okay, why don't you just take the cab? It's my day off. Knock yourself out, sweetheart. Thank you. While the protesters stopped short of... some sort of cover-up by the department, there are clearly a lot of frightened people in our city looking for answers... All right. Please, oh please. Come on, come on. It's Cole. Leave a message. Cole, the car won't start. You said you'd fixed it. You said you'd fixed it! Fuck! Oh my God. Are you okay? Do you smell gas? Gas? Yeah. You don't smell it? Look, can you just call me a cab? One that works. We believe that the killer is white, physically very strong, right-handed and uses a weapon similar to this claw hammer. He attacks his victims from behind and then claws at them. Due to the nature of the injuries inflicted, the killer must need someplace to clean up after each attack. Someone must know who this man is-- a wife, a daughter, a girlfriend. It's absurd. What is? What's with the tape recorder? Do you mind? I thought it might help us clarify things. I can switch it off if you'd like. It's fine. What's absurd? Everything-- what I feel. Well, what do you feel? I mean, you've told me what happened, but you haven't told me how you feel. I don't know how I feel, okay? But you-- you have some fear that perhaps Cole might be involved in these murders? I don't know. I don't know. Tell me more about him. He-- he's having problems with his career, isn't he? How did you know that? Well, I don't need a PhD to figure that out. He drives a cab, right? Cab driving was supposed to be a temporary thing. He was gonna go back to school. We needed the money, so... I see. Hello. Yes. What? Sure, I'll be right down. Some detective who wants to talk to me. Well, I'd better go and see what he wants. Um... we can finish this up later. My name is Marling. I'm a homicide investigator. An event, a person, a time, a place. Something. This is someone with a grudge, someone who feels cheated by life. In every other respect, he's the guy next door, just an average guy who kisses his wife goodbye every morning, spends all week scraping a living, all weekend fixing the house. Then it's night and-- pow! Something snaps. He's out butchering women, back in time for cocoa and a late movie. And no one suspects a thing, Ieast of all her. Are you Cole Hanniger? Yeah. My name is Marling. I'm a homicide investigator. Can we talk? Yeah, sure. Come in. I'm just-- just curious, Detective... what sick thoughts has my wife been putting in your head? Well, she's had to come to terms with some very traumatic events, Mr. Hanniger. Yeah well, she just wants her baby. Is that lipstick? So what do you think she's capable of doing if that doesn't happen? Did you see anyone else in the area? No. Are you sure? Yes. Okay. Thank you. Jelly bean? The plastic cigarette-- it just wasn't doing it for me. You ever try the patch or gum? It's not the nicotine that I miss. It's keeping my hands and my mouth busy, you know? I stopped by here the other night. You weren't here? Yeah, I was here. Didn't feel like talking, huh? Son of a bitch. What are these-- what are these Xs here? They're where the murders have occurred, right? Yeah. All within the two-mile radius of the central point. Which is where? Here. What, this street here? This hospital. I've been worried sick. Where have you been? What the hell are you-- did you tell me that my cab windshield got busted up, smashed? It did. Why don't you go have a look? Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah, Ros. Why don't you tell me where the hammer is? I'm sorry, what? The hammer from the kitchen cupboard. Or did l-- did I imagine that? Where is it, Cole? I don't know. I mean, I probably used it to fix the cab. What the hell difference does it make? What were you doing downtown the other night? Because I looked in your logbook and there's no pickup listed. Wait, what is this? I want to hear this from you. What is this? The hammer? You think it's me? You're sick. You think I'm the Nighthawk? I don't know. You think I could do that? You think I could do those things? This is so fucked up. I need a drink. I thought you gave up drinking. Yeah. Babe, like you quit smoking? No, I gotta get out of here. I can't fucking breathe. For Christ's sakes, clean this shit off the wall. Why don't we talk a little bit about your father? We haven't broached that subject yet. No. It's important, Roslyn. No. I don't want to remember that, okay? Well, if we're to make any real progress, we're gonna have to deal with this at some point. Oh, l-- I don't want to talk about it. The first time I was four years old. I remember his-- his hands around my-- my throat, pressing and choking and-- "You can't tell anyone. It's our secret. Do what Daddy tells you. Open your mouth. Spread your legs. You can't run because I'll always be there." "Daddy, I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to play this game anymore 'cause it hurts. Please stop, Dad. Please just stop. I want my mother. I want my mother." That's all. I just want my mom. I feel like I'm going insane. Let's switch gears here for a moment, uh, talk to you a little bit about Cole. Has he ever been violent towards you? No. Never hit you and never raised a hand to you-- nothing? Oh my God. What the hell is this, Roslyn? I swear to God I didn't do this. God damn it, you got this job because of me. What the hell have you been doing here? Beth, I swear to God, I did not do this. Jesus. You've got to get a grip, Roslyn. Beth, I didn't do that. Look, this Nighthawk thing has everyone on edge. You just have to concentrate on getting the job finished, all right? Beth, I didn't do that. Please, Roslyn, I'm asking you to get a grip. - Beth. - Please do not let me down on this. Beth, I didn't do that! It's not me. It's this fucking place. What are you talking about? Why don't you tell me why paramedics brought that woman here the other night. Tell me. What woman? Blonde, cut up really bad, brought here the other night by paramedics. I sent her to County. We haven't had anybody like that at County. And there isn't a paramedic in this state that would bring anyone here because they know that this place has been closed down. Jesus Christ. Okay. Okay. Okay. Kimberly Wallace. And then? And then? Oh my God. Every woman that was murdered was a patient here in this hospital. Cole was looking at their files. He saw their names, their addresses. Okay. Marling's on his way over here. You called him? Yes, I called him. What do I tell him? I can't tell you what to do, Roslyn. You have to decide that for yourself. Why do I come up here and talk to you? You're fucking useless! Your husband? That's a hell of a story. Where are the other files? I'll go get them. Wait a minute. I need to make a personal telephone call. Can I use the office? Yeah. I'll be right back. You think it's me? You think I could do those things? Is that my file? That looks like you had more than a paper cut. Where did you find that? It was on the desk. I took a peek. Call it professional curiosity. Look, we spoke to your husband. He checked out. He never mentioned that. Well, maybe he didn't want to worry you. Does he know about your mental history? I don't understand. Mrs. Hanniger, I have battered wives and hysterical mothers and vengeful daughters all convinced that they know who the Nighthawk Killer is. I don't know whether it's fear or paranoia or spite, but I don't have the time or the energy to follow up on all these stories. And quite frankly, an allegation from a woman with a history of mental illness and a juvenile conviction for manslaughter-- well, I'm just not sure how that's gonna help me-- or you, for that matter. I mean, it's all in here. You were admitted to this hospital for a psychiatric evaluation and then later transferred to a state mental facility. Okay! Go home to your husband, make up with him. It's for the best. It really is. The thing is, Mrs. Hanniger, you had access to those files too. Tell me about the conviction for manslaughter. It's all there. It's all there in my father's file, right there. I want you to tell me. It was my birthday. September 3rd, my 1 0th birthday. What happened? I don't want to play Daddy's special little game anymore because it hurts. I don't want Daddy to kiss me on my mouth and make me sticky. I don't want him to lift up my dress and tear off my panties. There must be somebody who can make him stop. Roslyn. No, Daddy. I don't want to play that game, no. Roslyn. Mommy. Mommy, help me. Roslyn. Roslyn. No. No. Mommy, help me. No Daddy, I don't want to. Mommy, help me. The door is now half open, Roslyn. Whatever else is beyond it will find a way out sooner or later. Before Cole, I never thought there could be anything other than sex with a man. He taught me how to love. He's not a killer. Even the cops say he's not. I love my husband. Let me out of here, you piece of shit. They have you listed as-- Motherfucker! They have you listed as Jane Doe. So why don't you tell me your name? Fuck you. Well, there's a whole chart on me. All it says is that you're a woman age 25 to 35, blonde hair, green eyes. That's all we have on you. So why don't you fill in the gaps, hmm? Okay well, I've been here before. You have? Oh really? Yeah, there is a whole-- there's a whole file on me. Bitch. Well, if there's a whole file on you... Hi. What are you doing here? I'm covering your shift. You have the night off. It was Beth's idea. She was supposed to call you. Hmm. I mean, are you-- are you sure? Yeah, I'm positive. Go enjoy your evening. You're gonna be okay though? Yeah, there's plenty of work to keep me busy. Come on. You're kidding me. Come on. That was delicious. Thank you. We should be able to talk about things, you know? Like what? Like-- Iike what's going on inside your head, Iike how you feel. You know I love you. I love you too. But that's not what I meant. What? You don't know what's real anymore, do you? Well... whatever it is that's going on inside your head, it's destroying our marriage. I had a fairly normal childhood, Roslyn. You know that. And I've tried to imagine what it must have been like for you. But they're your nightmares, not mine. I can't make up for what happened to you. But whatever it is that's haunting you, you gotta deal with this now, before it's too late for us. Roslyn. I'm sorry, what? You were daydreaming. What were you dreaming of? My mother. She died, what, 1 3 days after you killed your father? Yes. Tell me, what is your earliest memory of her? Do you recall? I remember watching her one evening in the hallway. She was in her bedroom brushing her hair. She had the most beautiful Iong blonde hair. I wanted hair like that. And what else were you thinking of as you watched her brush her hair? I wanted her dead. I wanted her dead. Why? Because she was a woman. Because she could understand how I felt each time he touched me... but she ignored me when I screamed for help. She just-- she walked away. Did you know that the Nighthawk also chooses women with a common characteristic? Each of his victims share a similar feature. They all have blonde hair. Mommy, you're hurting me. I won't hurt you if you keep up with me. - Where are we going, Mommy? - We're going on a journey, okay? No! Where are you going, Mommy? To the car. Mommy, where are you taking me? Come on, Roslyn. Oh shit. No. What are you doing, Mommy? Mommy! Mommy, no! Mommy! No. Mommy, what are you doing? Oh shit. Mommy, stop it. Mommy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Stop it. I don't like this smell, Mommy. No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't want your children to suffer like you did. It has to stop here. Please, no. No. Help! Mom, don't! Mom! Help me! Help! Why did your mother not want you to live? I got out. I got out of that car. Yes yes, you did. But look at the scars it left, the deep psychological scars. You still haven't told me why, Roslyn-- why your mother wanted you to die. Stop it. You can tell me. Stop it! Remember our breathing exercises. What are you doing? Breathe breathe. No. No? All right, then I'll tell you. - Stop it. - It's because she knew, didn't she? - Stop it. - She knew what you would become. She knew that you would carry on the cycle of abuse. The abused becomes the abuser. Isn't that right? - Please stop. Please stop. - Yes. You see, you must never be allowed to have children. Please stop. No, please. Please don't. Stop. No no no no! No no! I want my baby! What's going on, Roslyn? Where have you been? The psych ward. The psych ward? Do you want to tell me what you're doing with this file and with blood all over it? You're supposed to be filing these away, not ruining them. Why do they call him the Nighthawk? What? Why the Nighthawk? Because of the way he kills-- to the back of the neck. You're scaring me with this shit. What were you doing up in the psych ward? Your hand. I cut it peeling potatoes. Maybe you would change the dressing for me? It's this place, isn't it? It must be creepy at night. But if it's any comfort to you, if you go up to the fifth floor, at least the psych ward doc will be around. What? Dr. Diaz-- the doctor I told you about. He's actually going to turn up tonight, start with the psych ward records. Dr. Diaz? No. Dr. Clement. Doctor... Dr. Clement. Dr. Irvin Clement. I told you you weren't supposed to be Iooking at those files. That's where you got that name. It's the doctor that admitted you to the psych ward when you were a kid. He had an unorthodox way of dealing with his patients. What are you talking about? He was killed. One of his psych ward patients stabbed him in the head with a scalpel. He was alive for days fighting for his life. What are you saying? Have you been talking to Cole? Roslyn! Roslyn! Shut up. Did I frighten you? What do I do? ...violent killer. Bodies were all found in the same neighborhood, so he's someone in the area. A psych ward patient stabbed him in the head. Dr. Clement. Fuck! No no no no! Why do they call him the Nighthawk? ...bring anyone here because they know it has been closed. Useless! Roslyn! What's with the tape recorder? Why do I come up here and talk to you? You are fucking useless! No no! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! No no! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! - I want my baby! - I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! - I want my baby! - I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! Oh. Oh God. Oh God. It's Emma. She's dead. It's Dr. Clement. He's here. What the hell are you talking about? Just listen to me! It's Dr. Clement. He's here. He wants to kill the woman that did that to him. The woman who did what? The blonde psych patient. This is insane, Roslyn. I'm getting out of here right now. Don't you see? They were all patients, Beth. No, the stairwell. We've got to get out of here. Beth! Beth! Beth. I have to destroy the files. Somebody's finding them from the records. Oh my-- my God. Roslyn. I trusted you. We both trusted. Both been betrayed. I trusted that woman and she took everything from me-- everything. The abused becomes the abuser. Hmm? What are you doing? I'll drop it. I swear I'll fucking drop it! And I swear to God you will never-- you will never know who she is. On the other hand, go to hell. Help! Ros! Get back. Ros, Ros, come on. Ros. Come on, Ros. The fire, which has now been blazing for two hours, is thought to have started in the old disused incinerator. Firefighters from all over the city have been called in... So far no casualties... Well, that's one way to handle your paperwork. Ros. It's getting cold.
