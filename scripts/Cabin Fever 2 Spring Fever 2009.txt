Yeah, man, I see this kind of shit all the time. In fact, this ain't shit compared to what just happened on l-95 recently. I mean, a lady hit a moose and the motherfucker went right through the windshield, man. No. Yeah. I was partying with my cousin. - You know... - What kind of partying? ...partying like... - Okay. ...getting some hair pie like the man from Nantucket whose dong was so long them bitches couldn't even fuck it? And this fucking moose pissed on my pussy parade, man. I had to come down on a Sunday because he's sitting in the front seat of a Volvo wide awake with his head sticking out the cracks in the glass and shit, man. Poor guy. - I had to put him down. - Whoa. But I got a picture of it. I carry this shit with me now 'cause every time I'd tell that story nobody would believe me. - Laugh it off, man. - Okay. - This ain't shit. - Okay. All right? Just get the kids to school, all right? Yeah, okay. Thank you. Thank you. Stop! Winston, do you copy? Winston, do you copy? Yes, sir, I'm here. Where the hell are you? Smith Bridge Road. I'm still clearing the scene from that bus accident. I don't give a shit if it's a handicapped bus and there's a bunch of retards splattered all over the road. I need you back here now. There's a bunch of suits up here asking a whole lot of big-city questions about the way we do things. They were up at the cabin this morning and I need to make sure that your stupid ass is on the same page. Do you get me? Yes, sir, I'm on it. Sandy Taylor's fucking ridiculous. Yo- yo, John, you were just asleep at the wheel for the hottest girl in school. Yeah, not my type. Wait, Sandy is not your type? What does that even mean? Does that mean you're gay? Did you tell your dad? Was he bummed, or- Dude, you see her every day. You know she's a nightmare. No, I don't know that. In fact, neither do you. You don't even have a type, John, you have an obsession. 'Cassie! Cassie, I love you! Would you kiss me? Would you-' Seriously, man, don't take your fucking blue balls out on me, man. Don't think you're the only dude here thinking about taking Miss Gorgeous to Boomtown. I actually know you are the only person here dumb enough to take a girl out whose ex-boyFriend does have a fucking black belt in kicking teeth in. Look, man, I told you- there's no way that she's gonna go with me just days after breaking up with him. Why do you care anyway? You hate the prom, so drop it. I know, prom blows. But this is a whole different thing. This is important for you. You know what I mean? This is like... Besides, it really just proves how little you know about girls anyway. So- hey, I'm fucking talking. Come on. If she broke up with him, it's 'cause she finally realized how big of a fucking douchebag the guy is. And going to prom with you, that's like the ultimate power move, all right? You're the smartest dude in school, you've fucking known the girl your whole life, and you're head over heels in love with her. All right? I mean, come on. Spite is almost as important to those bitches as- as money. You know what I mean? She knows all this. I mean, now that Marc is out of the picture, revenge is exactly what she needs. For every single girl in this building, that is the priority- revenge. I mean, look at those two fucking savages right there. Hey. Oh, that's how it is- All right, all right, I'll think about it. Just fucking do it. Shave your pussy, get it over with. I'm rallying for your fucking cause. You need to do this thing. All right, I'm thinking about it. You'll regret it if you don't. Oh, fuck. I gotta get my goggles from the car. - Will you cover for me? - What do you want me to say? I don't know- I'm on my fucking period, man. Gotta get tampons. All right, well, hurry up. Whatever. Ha! Shut up. Don't say a word. Listen, people are talking. And how they're talking so soon when it's none of their fucking business, I don't know. But I hear things. I don't like what I hear. So you and your bullshit friends better stay the hell away from my girl. Do you understand me? Look, man... - Get your hands off me. - Okay. Listen, I don't care what she tells you or what you think you know, she's mine. Do you get it? It's cool, man. It's cool? - Yeah. - Really? You're dead. It's frustrating. It's frustrating. You- I'm frustrating to you. I understand that. Honey? Honey? Sweetie, listen to me. Angel, please listen to me. Don't hang- don't hang- You have anything to say for yourself before I launch into my tirade? Nothing? There are five weeks left in school. Count them- five weeks. And you're a smart kid. You got good grades. You're going to college in the fall. Why would you go and do something so stupid like start a fight? Why? I didn't start it. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. What? I said I didn't start it. Mm-hmm. Where are you supposed to be right now? Biology. Biology. Miss Hawker or Mrs. Jennings? Hawker. Well, you better get your little butt down there. Not even I can spare you from that. Mmm. - Jonathan? - Yeah? I don't want to see you around here again, mmm? Capisci? Now get out. Hi. I'm- Place the scalpel at the base of the throat and carefully make a slit all the way down the front of the frog's belly. Now... Got in trouble for being late, by the way. Yeah, well, so did I. ...and tack it down... I can't believe I missed you getting your ass kicked. That was, like, right after I talked about her too. Like telekinesis- wait, telepathy or teleki- which one? You know, I don't really want to talk about it, Alex. I wonder if we would wait till I left until he kicked your ass. Somehow I don't think it would have mattered. Yeah, you're right. I don't even know where I was going with that. - Alex Hicks! - Yes, ma'am? Quiet! - Sorry. - That's strike two! One more strike and you're headed to the office. - Mean old hag. - Mm-hmm. Now make an incision through the muscular tissue. Hey. No way. You think what they say about Mary is true, - that she's pregnant? - Shhh! What? Miss Hawker just told you guys to shut up, so shut up. I'm trying to learn. There's your prom date. Oh, dude, you know what? Fuck what I said about taking Cassie to the prom, man. Serious ramifications involved. Big fucking problem. Now set the heart aside. Next is the liver. Oh. Aw. Marc's a fucking douchebag. Mmm. Think if our dads were millionaires, we'd be douchebags too? I don't know. You would be. You little shit. Hey, are you all right? Yeah. No. What's the problem? I got dumped. Ungrateful shit. I don't know the guy, but anybody that would do that to you is a fool, in my opinion. I mean, if he didn't realize how lucky he was, then he's, like, the stupidest guy on earth. Really? Really. Wait wait. Wait. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. Oh, ow! - Ow! - Sorry, it's the braces. It's cool. Uh, hey. Hey, uh... So what's the deal? We gonna go to prom together or- Is that cool? No. OH, well, I just- I just assumed... Look, kid, you're real nice and sweet and everything. But this wasn't about you and me, okay? This was about revenge. Re- revenge. Yeah. Besides, I work for a living. Wha- Would you- would you please go to prom with me? I mean- If I can get one of the other girls to cover my shift, maybe I'll meet you there. How's that? Yeah. Yeah yeah. That's awesome. That- I mean, that actually works better for me in the long run. That's cool. Okay. I will see you- prom. See you there. Good afternoon, Jonathan. Hey. Daryl, Dane. We heard about you getting your butt kicked. Heard you cried like a little pussy. Yeah, that's not exactly what happened. That's not how we were informed. Yeah, Alex said that your little- So is it now safe to assume that you will be coming over tonight after all? Uh, I don't know, you guys. It's prom night. News flash, John- prom blows. How you gonna pass up 'Bride of the Cannibals 2: The Director's Cut' for a gay dance? It's the most insane sequel ever made; it's banned in over 26 countries. Can you even begin to comprehend that awesomeness? Yeah, we heard there's this one part where the broad with the piranha teeth bites the guy's dick and balls. John, you see it in a close-up. That does sound good. Yeah. But I'm still not sure what I'm doing tonight. What do you mean you don't know what you're doing? Prom's in, like, five hours. Who are you gonna ask at this point, your mother? If Mom would let me go to the dance, I'd be fucking so much pussy tonight. - Hey, John. - Hey, Cassie. Hey, do you want to walk with me? Yeah, sure. Yeah? I'll catch you guys later. Cool? Oh my God, those two are so funny. - D8D? - Yeah. Oh my God, I heard Dane scored 1500 on his SATs. - 1550. - What? - Yeah. - No way. How old is that kid? - Like 12. - Oh my God. Yeah, but I think he's living proof that you can be smart and stupid at the same time. You should see when he and Alex get together. Oh, Alex- I haven't talked to him in, like, forever. It's so weird. How is he? He's good, you know? - He's still Alex. - Yeah? Yeah, I think we're gonna go over to their house later and watch some movies or something. Okay. So you're not going to prom? Nah. Yeah, me neither. Well, you'll probably be disappearing to some amazing medical school soon, right? I did get into Adams. - You got into Adams? - Yeah. - Oh my God, why didn't you tell me? - I'm telling you now. Well, congratulations. That's awesome. That's what you wanted. Yeah, I guess it is. - Wow. - Thanks. So how are you doing? - What? - Everything. I don't know. I mean, it's okay. I don't know. I'm fine, I don't know. Like, relationships are hard. What can you do? Yackety schmakety. It was the right decision, though. - Yeah? - Yeah. You know, you're probably the only person I know who's actually going to do something with their life. - Oh, come on, that's not true. - No, it's true. Seriously, like, I have no clue what I'm gonna do. Nobody does, you know? Oh my God, everybody's going to be so super jealous when you come back to town and you're this really famous doctor and they're all a bunch of fat townies with ugly babies. I'm serious. Like, even Marc was jealous of you, you know that? Come on, Cassie, all these compliments you're paying me are making me a little uncomfortable. Well, you know, today's the only day you're gonna get 'em, so enjoy. Cassie, Mom's looking for you! - Okay. - I guess you better get going, huh? Yeah. Well, it was nice talking to you, John. - Yeah. Yeah, you too. - Bye. Hey, Cassie, wait up! Hey, do you want to go to prom with me? Look, I know you've been through a lot- things are a mess... but it's prom, you know? I don't know, it's the last few weeks of high school, and I just figure it'd be the kind of thing that we'd regret not having done. Look, I really want to go. And you're the only person I could see myself going with. So how about it? I can't, John. I'm sorry. Look, if you're worried about me getting beat up or anything, - don't worry about it. - No, I'm not worried about that. Like, l- it's just like my brother's sick and I've got all this stuff to do. And it's just, like, I don't know. It's just too much, you know? - I understand. - Yeah? - Yeah, it's all right. - Well, call me later. - Bye. - Bye. 'Bride of the Cannibals' it is. Stupid. Here's your pancakes, sweetie. Oh, Lucille. I've been dreaming about your pancakes all day. I know, baby. That's what all the young boys say. Oh, what the fuck, man? Bill! Bill! - Jesus. - Okay, Bill! Deliver us from all of this evilness! Full of the devil! I know you did it! Bill, you gotta breathe. Breathe. Breathe. In the name of all that is holy, oh, hallelujah, Lord. God, deliver us from these evil evil people! Oh! Oh my God! Bill, you're in trouble! Oh! Bill! The ambulance will be right here. Bill, I know where you come from, Bill. I know you're- come on, Bill! Oh! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Shit. This is bad news. This is real bad news. Yeah? I hope you're dressed. I have got big news. The entire team is going to the prom after all. Oh, so there's an 'I' in team now? John, don't try to be funny. You're not good at it. You're just not good at it. Hey, don't hang up. I didn't mean that. No no no no no no. John? John? - Spit it out. - Funny you should say that actually. All you need to know is that I have a date for prom. You need to get your ass out of fucking bed, get on a suit and tie, and that's it. You know, after listening to you rag on prom for the last week, I think I finally came around. Prom blows. That was a lot of rings. - I'm gonna go now. - No no, dude, come on. Dude, please. Please? You can't let me go to this by myself. You're my best friend. You can't do that. It's not in the book. You can't do this. Please, man. Please. - Please? - All right. I'll go. Thank God. - Hey. - Who goes there? Police. Open up. Oh, okay. Come on. Hey, look, she said she was 18. I always believe what children say. No, man, I need to see your delivery schedule. - Open the fucking gate. Come on. - Oh, okay. Okay, all right. I got the key right here. - No, wrong key. - Come on, man. - It's a fucking emergency. - I found it. No. Maybe it's this one. Son of a bitch. Looks like that one. Here it is. Gross. Hey. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Rick. What are you doing here? What do you mean? I came to see you. Me? Yeah. Is that not okay? No. I mean, yes. I mean, what about Sandy? Oh, she's busy preparing her prom queen speech. Couldn't take it. Plus I wanted to talk to you. Really? Sure. Yeah, the place- it looks really great. You do great work. You think so? Oh, yeah. It's beautiful. Ungrateful little shits. Come on. - What if the teachers show up? - To the pool? Get 'em off. Come on! It's beautiful! - Oh, Rick. - Oh, Frederica. I want to fuck you. Wait, do you have a condom? I'll pull out. What? What's wrong? Oh, are you on your period? No, I'm a virgin. - What- what now? - Fuck! My tooth. What the fuck? Oh my God, help me! Oh, stay away from me. Rick, help me. What is wrong with you? I bet my friends that you would be an easy fuck, not that you would be all fucked up! Help me! You bled in my mouth! Frederica? Frederica, stop it! Shit. Frederica! Frederica! Aw, shit. Whoo! Fuck! He cleans up real good, huh? Where did you get that? Um, my mom got it down from the attic. Well, it's very dapper. Dapper? I like that. Whoo. So should we just call it? Head over to D8D's and watch movies all night? Yeah, we should. Mm-hmm. Well, fuck that, motherfucker! We're gonna get laid tonight. I got a sure thing in there. Come on. This is it, baby- one last night to hate your life just a little bit fucking more. This is it, motherfucker. Two men going to prom together. It's exactly as it should be. Shit, man. Paperwork's never been my thing. Hey, careful with those files. Hey, uh, I'm just the night guard. I don't know anything about any of that stuff. If this is about some kind of bookkeeping cover-up or whatever, I don't know nothing about that. Just, you know, say no. Hey, you haven't seen my application floating around at the station, have you? I sent one in like six months ago. - Hey, what's today? - Friday. No, the fucking date, man. Um... Jesus! Shit! Oh, Daddy. You got another fucking beer, man? Shh. My secret stash. Oh, yeah. All right. Yeah. Can I use your phone? Yeah, just dial 9, then you'll hear a dial tone, then you dial the area code and then your number. It's different than a regular phone. - Is it working? - Herman. It's me, Winston. Hey, man, I'm in some deep fucking shit down here. You gotta help me. Man, turn down the 'Sepulter' and listen to me, motherfucker! No, I'm fucking serious, man. - L- - Hey, these guys with you? Hold on. No. Fuck, man! Now do me a fucking favor, Man. You gotta tell these motherfuckers that the water coming out of here is bad news. They cannot deliver it. Do you understand me? Why do I gotta tell them? Man, it's jurisdiction bullshit, you know? Ah, beaurocracy. Okay. Look, man, you're gonna be a fucking hero for this. Oh. Hnow what kind of pussy you're gonna get for this? Oh, man, you're gonna get the sashimi. What's that? Man, that's the primo pussy, man- no smell. Fucking hero, man. Yeah. Thanks, man. The water here is bull- So where is your hot date? She's late. Or not fucking coming. I'm gonna go get some punch. Do you want some more? No, it tastes like someone pissed in it. I'm gonna go lower my standards. I can't find Rick! I am not gonna be embarrassed on that stage! I am the prom queen and he's the prom king! Why are you trying to ruin my life? Sandy, nobody's trying to ruin your life. Perhaps he's just in the boys' room. Just calm down. Miss Hawker? Ow! Guess who. Cassie? - It's me! - Cassie! - You're here! - I'm here! - Yeah, I changed my mind. - Have some punch. Thanks. Yeah, I thought about what you said today. I don't know, I just thought, you're right. You know? It's prom. That's so great. I'm so glad that you're here. - Great. - Hey, baby. Hey, John. Sweetheart, do you think you can give John and I a minute? Because I would really like to apologize to him too. - I'll just be a minute. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. I'll bring you a fresh cup. Bye, John. Are you trying to be an asshole? I told you to stay away from her. But you couldn't leave well enough alone, could you? Could you? You want to know something about the girl of your dreams over there? Not only is she here with me and not you, but I'm gonna be fucking her tonight. I'm gonna take her home and I'm gonna fuck her every which way I want because I can. And no matter what I do, she's always gonna come back to me. What do you think about that? What? Oh, do you like that, faggot? Stop this! Stop this! Fuck you, man! Fuck you, man! - Fuck you! - What did you do? - Cassie, I didn't do anything. - That's a lie! You did something. Why do you always have to fight? Asshole! You hit like your fucking boyFriend. I didn't fucking do anything! This is bullshit! He fucking started it! Watch your mouth! This is the second time today I've had to deal with this nonsense from you. You're out of here. I will not tolerate this barbaric behavior- - Are you fucking blind? He started it! - Out out! I am out! I can't get any more out than this! School sucks! John, wait! Will you wait? Wait! Jesus Christ. John! John, will you wait? Will you just wait? John! What, Cassie? What? What do you want? - I'm just sorry. - Oh, you're sorry? You're sorry for what? You're sorry that I get blamed for everything or you're sorry that your boyFriend's a fucking asshole? Or you're sorry that you're too stupid to tell the difference? Is that it? Huh? You gotta be a little clearer with me tonight because I've got a bit of a headache! - John! - Fuck you! He is the worst human being in this fucking school, and you are the best. Now how does that work? Huh? Hmm? No, I want to know about that process- what goes through your head. How you can not like me, someone you've known for your entire life, someone who would treat you like an absolute queen, and instead go for that piece of shit back there. Why? Because he's rich? Because he's popular? I mean, Jesus, Cassie, you're not even poor. I mean, how obvious does it have to be? You would have to be practically retarded not to see that I'm in love with you. Everybody sees it. Marc sees it. Do you have any idea how embarrassing that is? No. No, of course you don't. I'm done with it. It's over. I can't take it anymore, Cassie. Hey, kids, you're gonna have to get back inside. Yo, we're having a conversation here, asshole. Not anymore. It's over. You need to get your girlfriend and take her back inside. That's not my girlfriend, all right, man? I'm going home. Stop! Get inside now! All right. - What the hell was that? - I don't know. I have a bad feeling. We gotta get out of here. Go. Who are they? I don't know. But I don't think that they're cops. Now I need you to go in there and get Alex, okay? No matter what he says, you get him out of there. You drag him by the hair if you have to, okay? Okay. But what about everyone else? I'm gonna tell Principal St. Clair what's going on, but I'm not staying here any longer than that. No matter what he says, we're getting out of here, okay? Okay. - Alex! Alex! - Cassie, have you seen John? You've got to come outside with me right now, okay? You just fucking cockblocked me. Okay. Don't get kicked out of prom. Just come with me. - All right. - God! Well well well. It is time to announce the prom king and the prom queen! Freak! God, what is taking him so long? So what are you talking about? There's dead bodies in here or something? You're not listening to me! I've had more than enough of this from you! - I told you to go home. - Back off! All right? Now there's a dead body in the pool and there's people surrounding the school! All right? Do something! Come on, boy, what kind of fool do you take me for? Principal St. Clair, there are people with guns outside- men in vans with guns! Will you just look? All right, wait a minute. Stay right here. Do not move. Go! What the hell is going on? They locked the doors! Wait, what? We're fucking trapped? What's going on out there? I'm the principal of this school! I demand to know what's going on. Who is that girl? Why is everyone looking at her? This is supposed to be my big night! Help me. Help me! Help. What, is this fucking terrorism or something? Why'd they lock us in? We just need to find a phone- we need to get help. No, we need to get out of here before they can lock all the doors. Art room has outside doors. No, the auditorium's way better 'cause it leads out back. What, is this contagious? Did you see that guy's fucking face? I don't know, man. You don't look sick. Neither do you. What the fuck? Last time I checked kids were taking trench coats to school, not fucking biological weapons! - My back. - Okay, all right. We need to get out of here. They're here! They're here! - Look. - What? No no no no. Oh, fuck. No no no no. Stupid fucking bitch. That fucking bitch. No no no. Oh oh! Fucking bitch. Fucking... Fuck. What do I fucking do? Don't fucking look at it. What the fuck? Oh, God. I need to go to the fucking library. I need to get those medical books- those books you always use, right? - Fuck! - It's not an STD! You need a doctor, not a book! Cassie! Cassie! Something is wrong. Something is very wrong. I had the baby. Please help me, please! - L- I can't help you. - Please! - You're sick, I can't- - My baby! I don't know what to do! Please! Get away from me! Get away from me! Get away from me! Don't come any closer! Don't move, please! - Please please... - Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh God. Cassie! Get the fuck down, man! Get your ass out of sight. Oh no, man! What's your problem? I'm a fucking chick magnet, man. And this fucking world's coming to an end, and we gotta get the fuck out of Dodge. No, don't do this to me, man. I just came down here to pick your silly ass up, man. What is this, man? Oh, light beer. You are pathetic. Take that back. Listen, man, I got everything figured out. I got my paperwork out of that fucking office. They're not even gonna know I was ever here, man. Yeah, well, I hate to rain on your parade- you just don't quit the police force without somebody noticing, man. You ever think about that? Up until this afternoon I was a fucking cop, remember? I know how this fucking bullshit works. I got it all covered. Just get the fuck out of here. You sure about this, Charlie, man? This is gonna be a mighty tall order. Let's roll, man. It's cool. All right then. Where are we headed? Come on. Are those gunshots? Come on. Please be quiet. My- my legs! They're going out! I made it! Please please help me! Help me! I made it! I made it! Please! Please help me! Please! - Alex! - Alex! Shit! He's not here! He's in the library. He's sick, all right? Whatever it is, he's got it and he's convinced that he can save himself if he knows what it is. He thinks I can help him. I can't fucking help him! Fuck! I never should have let him go! You know I can't leave him? You know that? Let's just go and get him then. - Hey. Hey. - John. Have you seen my date? 'Cause I'd like to give her some of my mind. No! Doors doors! Cassie, please! Come on, it's me! - Hey hey! - Don't fucking touch me, John! - Cassie! - It's a skin disease, man. It's a skin disease. They're in the building. You gotta get out of here! - You gotta get out of here. - Cassie, open the door! You gotta get out of here. They're shooting people, John. Open the doors right now! Open them! Cassie? Cassie? - Come on, it's me! - I can't. You might be sick. No no! I'm not sick. I'm fine. Please! Please! Open the fucking door right now. Do you hear me? Are you listening to what I'm saying? Open this door right now! Will you fucking shut up? Go away! Open the door. I can't! Look on the bright side, John- if I hadn't made you go to prom, you wouldn't have ended up with the girl of your dreams. Cassie, do you hear me? Are you listening to what I'm saying? You open this door right now! Cassie, please come on. You gotta open this door. You gotta let me in. Now! Cassie, please come on. Listen, I can help you. Listen to what I'm saying to you. This is me here. I can help you. Let's go. Come on! No one's being allowed through. The road's closed. It's an emergency situation. Come on, pal. We're already late for the wedding. - Cut us some slack. - No can do. Strict orders. You need to turn around and head back right now. Oh, this is fucked, man. We gotta get out of here. Don't worry about it, cousin. I'll handle this. Excuse me, officer? Why don't you step into my office for a minute? Listen, I'm a businessman and what do you say we work something out, okay? Butterfingers. Move it now! Where are we going? I need you to do something for me. It's gonna go really fast and then I'm gonna go into shock, okay? You're gonna have to do this. Okay? What I said before? I didn't mean it. Yeah, you did. Move, motherfucker! I'm gonna crack your fucking skull, bitch! Do you fucking hear me? Okay? Put your fucking head down, man! Fuckin' hit me, motherfucker! Yeah, come on, man! Yeah yeah! You gettin' warm, motherfucker! I gave you everything! You were nothing before me! You think you can just drop me because you fucking feel like it? What about my feelings? What the fuck? What the fuck? Feelings! How could you fucking do this to me, huh? I fucking loved you! - Cassie! - You don't break up with me! Nobody breaks up with me! Okay? What the fuck does he have that I don't? I want to fucking know! Do it, bitch! Just a little bit further. You've gotta get up. I lost too much blood. You've got to get out of here. Go go. Just come on, come on. You're gonna be fine. - You gotta go. - No. - Get up. - He's there! Get him on the horn! No. John, we've got to go. We gotta go, we gotta go. Come on, come on, cOMe On, cOMe On. No no no! No no no no! Go go go! Go! Run! Ow! Ow! Run! Run! Fuck you! Somebody! Please! Please! Please help me! Please! Stop the car! Please! Please! Please stop the car! Please please! Stop stop! Please! What seems to be the trouble? I need to go to the hospital. Please help me, please! What the fuck happened? Your old man kicked you around? No, I just need to go to the hospital, you guys! Please! - Come on in. - Please! This is my cousin Herman and I'm Winston. Thank you. Winston, can we just please get out of here? - Please? Please? - Fuckin' A! Hit it, Herman. Break a leg, whore. Fuck you, troll. And don't touch my stuff, bitch. That is hot. I think that chick goes to my kid's high school. Man, that's fucking hot. Yeah, right? Yeah. Yeah! I'd still fuck her. No doubt. Honey, how old are you? Old enough. Excuse me. You okay? Honey, you- you just make me so hot. What the fuck? Fucking bitch. God. Hey. The song wasn't over. Fucking whores. Prom blows. Extracted By: Abu Essa
