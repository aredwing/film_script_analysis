They say that one evening, during a strong snowstorm, the spirit of snow turned into the terrible Snow Witch, and roamed the mountains and plains. And if a man accidentally spied her, the Snow Woman immediately took possession of him. Common villagers believe this legend.

This tree is remarkable! It looks like a living being. Truly! It stood here for many years. And now... at last, we found it completely by accident. Thanks! Master, the weather is terrible. What shall we do? This night will be very nasty. Let's stay here until the night is over. It doesn't matter. But there will be much to tell about after. It is a very happy evening, we have found the splendid material for which we searched so long. And the blizzard's howl sounds to me as if it were a song of celebration. Yes, we will obtain the permission of the Bailiff, and saw this tree as soon as possible. At last I will begin the work. My name will be known in Mino mountains, and my work will remain with the people for a long time. And the people will remember for thousands of years that the goddess Kannon was made by my hands. You, so young and so beautiful... I decided that I will not kill you. But in return, you mustn't tell anyone about what you saw today! Even your most intimate people. Even relatives, children, or your wife. If you say even one word, I will kill you. Keep silent about this! Swear! Yes, yes, I swear! I won't talk! I won't tell anyone! I'll be silent. Please, don't kill me! What's happening? - Did you have a nightmare? - It's alright. I slept badly. Are you hiding something from me? What nonsense! I have nothing to hide. I hope so. You see, I know you well. But I can't understand anyway what caused my husband's death, and why you're sick since then. I just forgot to put wood on the fire, and he froze in his sleep. The people who brought you home the next day said the same thing. Well, if you know nothing more, then I should believe their words. Heave-ho! Heave-ho! The tree! They brought the tree! The tree which master found! What? My husband? Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Here is the village! At last! Hey, heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Here is the tree! They brought it at last! Bonze! The Prior of the temple said, today they brought that good material, which the deceased Shigetomo found. He said you're the successor of the master. Set about the work on the goddess Kannon immediately. But I... What do you say? I completely lack the experience for such an important work. Never mind. The deceased Shigetomo has always praised you. And the Prior insists that despite your youth, your work is noteworthy. Thank you for such complimentary words. Yosaku, if you refuse this job it would be extremely impolite. You must agree. Yes, I will undertake this work which the master desired so much to do, although I'm not worthy of this honor. I have taken advantage of your roof. Please, excuse me. Get out of the rain! If you stand under such intense rain, you will be utterly drenched. Don't hesitate, please, come inside. No, I don't wish to impose on you... Why? People shoud help each other in situations like this. Let me open the door for you. It's an old house, there's no need to hesitate. Thank you very much for your care. It's so unexpected... It's a spring rain already, nevertheless it is cold. Here, please, drink this hot beverage. No, thank you. I will continue on my way, soon. But you can't go now, can you? Where are you headed? Guj Hachiman. So far? Such a young girl under such rain! I wish you only good things. Please, spend the night here. Mistress, this girl has got soaked. Forgive me, you must change into dry clothes immediately! Please, here you are! Here is clothing, if you please. You're so beautiful! I look at you and envy you! It looks like the hand of a living person! Is this the hand of the goddess Kannon? Just a sample. It's a very complicated work, and I'm inexperienced, so I must repeat it ten times more. It turns out well! My master was an outstanding craftsman. The hand is very bad. It's beautiful. I would like to have such beautiful hands. Your hands are beautiful! I was entrusted to carve the main sacred statue for our local temple. To obtain this work is a great honor, for any master of Buddhist statues. But I'm not sure that I have the ability for this. So I worry very much. Don't worry. Surely, everything will be all right. You're very gifted. I undertook this work, risking my life, because my master couldn't make it, but I... Surely, you will complete it! Thank you, I don't know why, but it seems to me that I lack courage. It is late already. Good night. No. I would like to look more. If I will not disturb you... Of course not. Everything's all right now. You saved me. Don't worry. Mistress, what's the matter? I felt heaviness in my sleep, at night. But Miss Yuki looked after me. So everything is okay, now. I see. Excuse me, I slept like a log. Never mind. You worked very hard and got very tired. Miss Yuki's parents were doctors. - She recognized all my symptoms right away. - Really? There is an excellent medicine for this illness. I'll go for it later. Where? It is an herb. I believe it grows somewhere hereabout. Here's the herb. A medicine. There's a lot of it here! Really. And here, and here. Miss Yuki. Are you in a hurry to leave? Couldn't you stay in our house, until the mistress gets well? Someone is waiting for you, probably. Me... I have no one. Really? Neither do I. You too? I didn't know my parents. My deceased master saved me and raised me as his son. I see... But as for you, Miss Yuki... do you have a fiance? - Really? - And have you already a bride? Nonsense! Who would marry me? Really? Miss Yuki! What impudence! I don't care if you're just children, I'll show you no mercy! Bailiff! Children, what did you do? Are these your children? They scattered logs! - It hurts! Forgive me, please! - Such impudence! - Mistress! - Take that! And that! Get out of here! Mistress! Who are you? I'm Yosaku. I once asked you for permission to fell a tree. I'm master Shigetomo's apprentice. - Master of Buddhist statues? - Yes. Mistress! Mistress! My horse! Mistress! I will punish you later. Just wait! Go! I'm... dying. - Mistress! - Hold on! Miss Yuki, your arrival here was no accident. I beg you, take care of Yosaku! Yes. Yosaku will surely become master. But someone should help him. Miss Yuki, please, marry Yosaku! Yes... But... I beg you! It's an imposition, but if you wish... Thanks! - Mistress! - Mistress! - What? The old woman died? - Yes. You need not punish her now. It's enough! But what about the woman? The woman? I ask you, what became of this girl? She married Yosaku, performing the dying request of the old woman. Do you like me? Yes, I do. Since the first time I saw you. And I do also... Really? Yuki... Why is your body so cold? Where did you disappear to? Your face is turning blue! - I don't feel very well. - What happened? Is everything okay? Yes... It is better already. - Let us return home. - Yes. Let us return home. Are you all right? Let me give you a hand. Oh, it is the Bailiff! What an unexpected visit! What happened? Some pressing matter? As you know, I was invited into the capital by the high court Official. I have arrived this morning. Fortunately, I met there this man. Who is he? His name is Gykei, he's a master of Buddhist statues in the capital. He belongs to the school of Unkei. He's a very famous master. Let me introduce myself, Gykei. By the way, he was the one I wish to talk to you about. I heard your temple needed the main sacred statue. Please, entrust its production to master sculptor Gykei. I'm very grateful for your proposal, but I've already entrusted it to Yosaku, Shigetomo's apprentice. I understand! If Shigetomo made the statue, it would be another story, but this is too great an honor for an unknown youth. Besides that, I've heard that five years have already passed since you entrusted him with this work. Five years have passed already, but he has done nothing! May I speak? I have heard that it requires 4-5 years to dry the material for the statue. Yosaku is probably waiting until the material is ready. I understand! But I say you entrusted an unknown master with producing the main sacred statue for the state temple. What will you do, if he does not finish it? He has not started to work yet, so let Gykei also do it. We will look at their works and select the best. Do you have any objections? Well, it sounds very convincing. I will agree. I am so happy! Because I've got a good wife. I feel the same about you. Also, you're a marvelous mother. I hope... my son also thinks so... You're a good mother. Moreover, you are still as beautiful as you were before. Gykei, he is your competitor. Yosaku, Gykei is a very famous master. We've decided just now that he'll also produce a main sacred statue for the temple. But this work was entrusted to you, wasn't it? Show us what you are capable of. - This woman... - What? I've hunted for women in the capital for five years, but among them, there was none to compare with her. She is even more beautiful than she was before. The Bailiff supports Gykei. But I won't lose to him! I have changed in these five years. Now, now, near the small brook behind the house, A snake lived before, and a tortoise lives now. A common tortoise, but it steals people. Yesterday it took four people, and today five more. A family of nine people in all. And these stolen people disappeared... Tar doesn't sing! Don't you know this song? Then don't bother us! His mom! She will punish us. Let's run! Tar. Everything is okay, your mom is here. Are you injured? Mom, teach me to sing this song! You are too young, it is difficult for you! - No. Teach me! - Will you be able to memorize it? Now, now... near the small brook behind the house a snake lived before, and a tortoise lives now. A common tortoise. But it steals people. Yesterday it took four people, and today five. A family of nine people. And these stolen people disappeared. Now, now. Mom! You must win certainly, otherwise I'll lose my honour. You're the famous Gykei. You produce such splendid statues, Yosaku won't be be able to compete with you, even if he stands on his head. Villagers usually know nothing of high society. Yes, that is so. They're like the frogs that live in the well. Yosaku competes with you, but there are boundaries, and he doesn't know his place. It seems to me he's poor, and also has a low position for this kind of work. But he's very self-confident. By the way, his wife doesn't match him either. Don't worry, everything will be alright. It's unfair! Gykei has apprentices, but you have to do everything yourself. Yosaku! Is Yosaku home? Official! What are you doing? We're arresting him for cutting down a tree on the land of the Bailiff. Do not resist! This is unbelievable! He gave me permission to cut down the tree! Shut up! The Bailiff says he knew nothing about it. What are you waiting for? Take him away! Wait! My husband obtained an order from the state temple! He must carry out this work! You can't take him away! We'll take him away, regardless. Take him! Wait! The Bailiff is a merciful person. If you want to save your husband, you should serve the Bailiff. What? The Bailiff likes you. You will obtain glory and wealth. Villain! What? You don't accept? Fine! Then, pay me the penalty for illegally felling the tree: three gold coins. What did you say? I will sell you this tree for three gold coins. But if not, we'll take away Yuki and she won't return while she lives. - I will pay! - Yuki! You will pay? Well, we'll give you five days, alright? Five days! Yes, that is fine. If you don't pay in five days, the Bailiff will be waiting for you impatiently. Five days, five days... You! How could you make this promise? This is illegal! How can such unscrupulous people live in this world! Yes, it's illegal, but the Bailiff has a higher position than we have. But isn't there someone above the Bailiff? The Bailiff has a patron. He occupies an important position in Mino. I see... Patron... You can't personally present an application! You can just pass it through the Bailiff. But I can't. That is why I am here in person. Please, allow me! Impossible! The master is away now. Then, allow me to give it to his wife. I think we'll understand each other. Impossible. Madam is busy because her child suddenly became ill! Child? Can you cure him? Can you? If something happens to him before the Master returns... I cannot live! May I report? There is a woman before our gates, who says she's the daughter of doctors. She asks permission to see the child. This way, please. Will you be able to cure him? Will my child get well? I have a child the same age as yours. I relate to your misfortune as if it were my own. I will save him, even at the cost of my life! Thank you! I trust you. She's only a woman! She's not a specialist able to cure him! Even we were unable. Even though we have tested all possible means and methods. It's very difficult to cure this illness. I've never seen such a terrible fever in this age. If we could stop his fever, it would be save. Now, now, near the small brook behind the house a snake lived before, and a tortoise lives now... When did you return? Where did you go? You... Why do you look so pale? If I can cure the child of the patron, then I'll obtain a reward. - Therefore you... - I will cure him for sure! Now I can't care for you, but, be patient a little, please. I'm fine. But you are so pale... Don't worry. It's because of the work. I have to go now. Care for Tar, please. I cooked dinner for you. Yuki! - Where's your wife? - She went out. And you let her go? Well. You have only three days left. If you don't pay, you know what will happen. I know. Well, that's good. This is your goddess? Poor work! Looks like a doll! You won't be able to win. You're just the frog that lives in the well. I repeat. Three days. Is that clear? He arrived! He arrived! Wife! Is it true that our son is at death's door? Does he still breathe? Is he alive? - Yes. - Thank goodness! He's alive! Son! Son! - So good, so good! - What happened? Everything is all right. She saved our son, when even the doctors proved powerless. Thank you so much for saving our child. Thank you! I'm so grateful that you saved him! Please, accept this reward as a sign of my gratitude! Gykei sad he will deliver the statue to the temple tomorrow. Tomorrow? But what about you? Is it not ready yet? I have almost finished, but... I still can't do the face. What? The face? I racked my brains, but I can devise nothing. Yosaku, what are you saying? The Bailiff requires that you present your work. I know. That is why I... - Yosaku, what happened? - No, I can't... - Bailiff. - Yosaku! You have not forgotten? Pay the three gold coins! But I... You can't? At last do you understand? - Take him! - Aye! What are you doing? - Yosaku has important work! - That is not important. You? Take the money and depart, please. Yuki! Tar! Forgive me. I will never leave you again. Don't leave me again! Of course not. But then, other men will come to take away my father. No. No one will take him away. Your dear father... That is it! The face! My face? Now I know how to make the face of the Goddess. Here it is! This work is remarkable. We expected it from a master known in all of Japan! Don't you like it? Look at her face attentively. In my opinion, the face, which shines of gold, is too bright. Really, both bright and beautiful. That's fine, but it's not enough. It needs something more. Something more? What can that be? - Compassionate heart. - Compassionate heart? Look at her face attentively. Do you see compassion in her eyes? It's a pity, but it's impossible to pray to such an image. Tell Yosaku I'm awaiting his work. Certainly, I will tell him. Yuki! Yuki! Let's go to the holiday ritual. To the holiday ritual? In no way I can imagine eyes for the goddess. My last chance is to ask the gods for help. Let us go together. Yes, but... I heard, the Prior said the goddess must have a compassionate gaze. But I can't visualize this gaze. Apparently, I need to ask the gods for help. I have almost finished my work. If you will also come, let us ask the gods together. Yes. Let's go together. And let's also bring Tar. Tar! Tar! Bubbles in the boiling water! Where's mom? At last, my desire will be carried out. Don't be afraid. You're even more beautiful when you are afraid. You've such white skin. I've never seen a woman with such skin. I have dreamed so long of undressing you! Do you tremble? It's very nice! Thus, remove your kimono and show me your beautiful skin! Well? Do you cry? You shouldn't. You! You! Snow Woman! I must kill anyone who has seen my true appearance. I'm guilty! I'm guilty! Where is Mom? Well, probably she has already returned home. Possibly, she's already home! Sir! Sir! Snow Woman! Mom returned! Have you finally returned? We searched for you so long. Mom, where have you been? Mom, What happened? What happened, Yuki? Today I must finish my work at all cost. But I can't. Because I see a dark shadow. - Shadow? - Why does this shadow follow me? You see, I have almost finished everything. - The Bailiff has been killed! - They say his servants are also dead! This was a strange death! Yuki. They said the Bailiff has been killed. What? I did not catch... No, I heard well. They said the servants are also dead. Let's go and look. It's not necessary to look. I have already seen everything with my eyes. Really? Who killed the Bailiff? I saw you five years ago. What are you saying to my wife? You are a ghost! I recognized you that previous time. And I have seen you again last evening. You killed the Bailiff in the little house near the temple. It wasn't a simple death. It was done by a ghost. You did it! Vile ghost! Shaman! I will not allow such violence in my house! Get out! It's your ghosty wife who must leave! - Ghost? - Yes! I will prove it to you! There's a scar on her arm from the boiling water I splashed on her five years ago. Look! Get out! Get out! I will not spare you despite your being a shaman! Traitor! Yuki! Don't be afraid! I won't allow even one finger to touch you! You're my only wife. And Tar's dear mother. No one can break our happiness! Yuki, it seems to me that my soul was cleansed just now, and I can complete the work. Really? But this dark shadow remains nevertheless. The shaman said you are a ghost. I don't believe this. She also said there's a five year old scar on your arm, but I don't believe in such nonsense either. But I recalled an event just now, which occurred before our wedding. When I look at your kind face, I can't believe it ever happened at all. But I still fear to recall that terrible evening. Yuki, I have one very bad memory, which I have never told anyone about. It was five years ago. There was a terrible snowstorm that night. I saw the terrible Snow Woman who killed my master. Yuki. It was me. You? Despite everything, you finally spoke of it. You shouldn't have done that. For all these years, I have prayed for your silence so many times. I... Since becoming your wife, I learned human happiness. And when Tar was born, we lived happily together. And I prayed only about that, not to lose this happiness. But finally you... You talked about this! I must kill you. You have broken your promise! I will kill you. Take care of Tar now, instead of me! And complete your work, and let it be excellent. Yuki... Mom! Mom! Where are you going? Don't leave! Compassionate gaze! Mom! The End Timing and spellcheck by Dan
