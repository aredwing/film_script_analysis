Chapter I - Yu A long time ago when I was little, I always watched my mother pray. Holy virgin Maria, mother of Jesus Christ. Pray for us sinners when possible. Pray for us now. Pray for us when we're dying. Your Grace, Mother of Jesus. I remember her beautiful face. Blessed virgin Maria, chosen one. What is it, Yu? Come to me. I remember the beautiful statue of Maria. Everything was holy... Thank you, Father, for your love, for providing the food on the table. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Are you okay? I'm fine. Shall we eat? Blessed by Jesus Christ. Virgin Maria, Mother of Jesus. Pray for us sinners when possible. Rest your weary ones. Bless your dying ones. There's a possibility that I'll be going away on a trip. On a trip? Can you take care of yourself? I want you to keep this for me. Virgin Maria... Find a woman just like her to marry. Introduce her to me when you find her. Yes, I promise. It's a promise then. Jesus, Maria, and Joseph... In your mercy, look with love on our dying loved one. Mother died when I was in grade school. Dad. She said she was going on a trip. Did she... Dad decided to become a priest then. I grew up watching him dedicate himself to the Bible. During that time I realised that Mother hadn't... gone away on a trip but had died. I remember the day Dad became a priest, not just a Christian. And we moved out of our family home into the parsonage. Here you go. This is heavy... Are we done? Mother. We're doing fine. My Dad, the priest. He became known for being gentle and caring. His interesting sermons made him popular. The charity bake sale would be considered a success if I 00% of the participants thought it was a great event. We were happy then. Heavenly Father, thank you for this food, we ask you to bless it... Thank you for watching over us, amen. We had a peaceful life. Until she came along. Remember when you were helped by others... On that day... It helps us to remember that we're being loved by God. When we remember that... we know that we have support and are loved. We can always hear the whisper of Jesus in our ears. "Go and do the same to your neighbours." But who are your neighbours? Don't be selective. Help and support everybody equally... Can I help you? Are you okay? This is the first time I've come to a church. I've never thought about God. I'm ashamed. You shouldn't be. Everybody's like that at first. When I listened to your heartfelt sermon... I couldn't help crying. Oh, you're so kind. Make me a Christian, please. I suggest you take it slowly. No! I can't wait, I want it now! You shouldn't rush things. It is wonderful that you're asking for God's help. Have you ever read the Holy Bible? No. First, take your time and read it carefully. Father. Can you teach me? Miss, are you okay? Hello, are you okay? Thank you. Father! Father! Father! I bought it! I've read I 2 pages! The passages around here... I was so moved. From that day on she came to see Dad everyday. Love should never betray. She didn't miss a single day. Wish for your blessing. Never have ill feelings. Read from this sentence. Respect each other. Do so willingly. By serving the Lord, you live in hope and endure hardships... Father. Can I go to confession too? Yes, once you become a Christian you can go anytime. Just the 2 of us... Yes? Just you and me in that tiny room, right? Yes. Kaori Fujiwara. In the name of the Father, the son and the Holy Spirit... I baptise you. In no time she'd become a Christian. I know it's sudden but I have a confession to make. Father, I'm in love. Yes. But he isn't allowed to fall in love. But it's already too late. Do you understand? Can you feel my heart beating? Sorry but you have to go. Father, listen to my confession! If you turn away from me, I'll kill myself. Please listen to me. What can I do...? I'm in love with you. I know, I really am a hopeless woman. What can I do about it? Please listen to my confession. Thank you. If you don't mind... Yes? Can I have your cell phone number? Hello? I need to see you now. Meet me at that park nearby. What is it? What do you want with me? I love you! Let me go. No! You smell so nice... - Don't do this! - Hold me, here and now! Stop this, let go! Hit me more! Stop! Hit me! I'm such a bad girl! Father! Dad rented a house away from the church. We all moved there. Catholic priests can't marry. It was a hideout for them. Dad told me to move my things into the new house. When I was packing I threw out lots of mementoes. Except for Maria. Do, Re, Mi... Sukiyaki for dinner? Fa, So... Don't we look happy? Yeah, sure... Thank you, Father, for the food on the table. In the name of the Lord Jesus. - Amen - Yes, amen! Well let's eat! Lord. Give me strength. I need you to help me now. Lord, you have eternal mercy. Don't abandon your creations. The Zero Church is a controversial new religion. It boasts some 500,000 believers. Their spiritual leader is a man known as "Zero." Under his command... Soon our life with her began to fall apart. Oh, the Zero Church. These cult religions are terrible. Yeah? Well you're quite corrupt yourself. Do you think you can go on deceiving your Lord? We've talked about this already. Those "Zero" guys are better! They donate tons of money to prove their faith! When are you going to marry me? What's going on? You said you'd marry me. You promised me, didn't you? You promised you'd marry me! Study the teachings of "Zero" and try to lure people into their religion. Help out those who are in need. Thank you very much. Where's your hubby? We're not married. He's terrible! I've had enough already. I've had it with this secret life! - Wait a minute! - I can't take this! Soon she left Dad for a younger lover. She'd been around only for 3 months. For I whole week after she left Dad didn't speak a word. But I was quite relieved. Dad, dinner's ready. Lord, give us the strength to go on. Forgive us. Dad started to pray to the Lord as if he was possessed. Dad changed. He became somebody different. He who killed the prophet... who beat the messenger with a stone. I've tried hard to gather you all together. Like a hen would try to gather her chicks under her wings. Dad's sermons changed too. They became horrifying. But you didn't answer my call. Look at this. Your house of religion will be abandoned forever. Save us from evil. Forgive us, our sins. Yu, come here. Come to confessional tomorrow. Yes, Dad. In the name of the Father, son and Holy Ghost. Amen. Have you sinned today? Not really. You must have. Think. I haven't sinned. Think harder. What's this about? - Dad. - Think harder. Have you sinned? Have you sinned today? Forgive me. You can't see your sins. You mean, you haven't sinned? Not at all. Think again. It was the beginning of Hell. I'll tell you. Your sin is that you can't remember your own sins. Now that's a sin. Be more aware from tomorrow. Have you sinned? I have to remember! The blue sky... Grasses by the river... An insect on a leaf... Flowers in the wind... I can't think of any sins! Today... I've got one! I went in a caf with a wet umbrella and... I splashed water all over the place. And then? And... maybe I sprayed water on the customers and made a bit of a disturbance. It was indeed quite obnoxious. Anything else? Have you sinned today? I can't think of anything. Oh, that's right... I was tired on the bus coming home... so I didn't offer my seat to a mother with a small child. Go on. What else? I kept forcing sins out of myself like this. It felt like squeezing out the last bit of toothpaste "365 days to the miracle". I became very alert. I always looked for sins I might have committed unknowingly. Though unfortunately I was really just an ordinary high school kid. To put it simply I wanted to die. - Thanks. - You're welcome... I couldn't even kill an ant. I loved my father very much. Even though he'd changed. I remembered the words my mother had told me. Introduce your Maria to me when you find her. Promise me... Soon I started to think that Virgin Maria was the only woman for me. "265 days to the miracle". What are you doing? Getting toothpaste... Keep your teeth clean. Anything white is wonderful. Your teeth should be white too. Don't you imagine for a minute that you're good. You'd be a hypocrite to think so. Yes. There's no escape from being bad. Yes. - Are you a bad boy? - Yes. - Are you bad? - Yes, I'm bad. Very well, you bad boy. Admit your sins. I see my sins now. No, you have to admit your sins. Yes, I admit my sins. Confessions never stopped. Dad endlessly asked me about my sins. Have you sinned today? I didn't help an old woman at a crossing. I had to lie. Actually I'd helped the lady. In the name of the Father, the son and the Holy Ghost you're forgiven. Amen. You lied today. I can tell. Were you lying? I'm sorry... I realised that I had to start committing sins for him. From now on I would do my best to sin! That's how I felt then. From then on, I was busy committing sins for Dad. Sins and even bigger sins! I made up my mind during class. I was ready to sin. Could you kick that over to me? Can you kick me the ball? What did you do that for? I broke my classmate's eraser. And I squashed some ants. A kid asked me to kick his ball to him. But I kicked it away because it sucked. In the name of the Father, the son and the Holy Ghost. Yu. Yes? What was that about? You're not serious. I give up on you. " I 65 days to the miracle". I'm home. When I came back from school the next day, Dad was gone. He left me a letter. "I'll go back to the church." "You live here by yourself." Dad! Don't call me that here. Father, when are you coming home? - Where? - Home! My only home is that of the Lord. Dad! Go home. This is a house of God. It's not the place for you. What are you doing? Come on! You too! Get out of here! Shit, I'm cold. Hey, I'm Yuji. Call me "Tag" Yuji. Or Wimp Yuji. Shut up! I'm Takahiro. You? I'm Yu Honda. - Shione High? - Yes. - What year? - First. The same as us! Really? Maybe we should hang out together. He should meet Senpai. Senpai? Come with us. - It'll be fun. - I'm cold. Senpai! Who's he? He's a newcomer. - Hold this. - Yes. Give me a hand. What's with you? Let's commit lots of sins! What? See? He's weird. I like him. He cracks me up. Listen up, everybody! From today we have a new guy. What's your name? It's Yu Honda. - Yu Honda. - Yes. I don't know what's wrong with him but he's joining us because he's into sin! Yeah, that's right! Why? - Because I need to sin. - Like what? Rob a store? Kill someone? What do you mean by sins? My father's a priest so I need to sin. Your father's a priest! A priest! Hey, this guy's a blast! Anyway, from today, he's one of us! Every day since then I did all I could to become sinful. I'm ready. I learned everything. How to fight and shoplift. Next was the real thing. I made many wonderful friends. Yuji, Takahiro and Senpai! It was fun everyday. Show off your tags! Hurrah to the shoplifters! Cheers! Give him more! I have to confess! Lord, I have sinned in many acts of evil. I betrayed you. Dad, I've betrayed your trust too. I don't deserve to be your son. Pity me for I'm a sinner. In the name of the Father, the son and the Holy Ghost I forgive you. Amen. Every day I went to the priest and told him my sins. Like I was giving him souvenirs. See you tomorrow. You're very strange. - Am I? - Yes, a wacko. What's a wacko? Strange, that's all. Am I strange? You do bad things so you can confess to your dad? Yes, that's right. You're perverse. Perverse? Don't you know it? What do you mean? Forget it. How do you like confessing to your dad? He always forgives me. I understand. Would your dad be happier if your sins were worse? I don't want to kill anyone... No, that wouldn't do it. I know what priests find really offensive. Obscene things. Obscene? That would be perfect. Yu's got to meet him. Lloyd. Master Lloyd! What do you want? Sir, this guy wants to learn from the Master. Is that true? Huh...? Do you really want to learn? Anything you want or desire... Anything you want to know... All the world's truths can be found here. What are you seeking? What are you seeking for, son? - Sins. - Very well. Anything else? Don't hide it from me! Maria. One day I hope to find my Maria Stop! Master will speak his mind now. Anything you seek can be found here in the groin. Between women's legs! "All My Sorrow" This is the only book I've ever written. Read it tonight! I will. I'm lonely. But I don't know why. What is the reason for my loneliness? In vain I gave it a lot of thought. I looked for the reason. Do you understand? Perfectly! Do you understand my lonely life? I do, Master. - I'm lonely. - Yes. - I'm so lonely. - Yes, Master! - You shall be my apprentice! - Yes! Then my training began. I could endure it for Maria. Hold the camera. - Go for it. - Yes. Watch me. Use a rope to get a peek-a-panty! Good. The moment that the target isn't looking... He's good! My turn! - He's bad. - Next! Use a Kung fu technique to steal a snapshot! Very good. Go for a spin with a radio controlled camera car! Use the three section staff and get a close-up of the bush! That's good. The art of voyeur photos is known as "Tosatsu." - Tosatsu... - It means to steal with photos. It's a divine act. Any act of holiness will be punished by the people. Just like Jesus was punished. You're looking for your Maria. And she's somewhere on this Earth. You'll find her someday. I'll do my best. We'll go downtown tomorrow. Yu, observe carefully. Hey girls. What are you doing now? Do you want to play a match? Good. Excellent! - Do it! - Yes! Well done! Feel the loneliness! Oh, no! I have to walk to one side. It's so dangerous. Get closer. Yes, you're quite right. What shall I do? Walk to one side. - Good idea. - Let's do that. Stop there, women! Great! - Good boy! - Should I sin? Go ahead and sin! Yes! Father! What? I took peek-a-panty photos up girls' skirts. That is a heinous crime! Sorry, Dad! No sins had swayed him, the priest, until that moment. He had forgiven other sins but suddenly he was my father. Dad... Hit me more. - Dad, please hit me again. - Don't say that. Hit me! I'll confess more. - Dad! - You pervert! This made me happy. Like finding something I'd lost. Like finding Dad again. I was happy he hit me. Did you confess to him? He beat me up and called me a pervert! I knew it. You look happy. It'll be easy now. I can do this a million times. Become erect with your heart. With all your heart... An erection from my heart. With all my heart. But I didn't get a hard-on. Impossible. I'd never had one. I didn't feel horny. I have to find Maria and get a hard-on! Where is my Maria? What are you looking at? You looked up my skirt! Pervert! In order to find my Maria... I tried harder and harder. You did it again! Yes! You, pervert! I did it again. Why you...! It was so easy now. I could sin any old time. "65 days to the miracle" He's incredible. He's the man. You're confused. He's just a pervert. Father! Don't come here any more! So I prayed outside the church. What did you take a photo of? What's this? Give it to me. Let's go to the police. This one's waterproof. When it rains, it's like taking photos under the sea. Come to the police! OK, I'm always ready. Oh yeah? Let's go then. Wait. Hey! Come with me! What were you doing there? I was praying. I'm Aya Koike. Who are you? What's your name? - What do we do? - Rescue him! - Wait! - Why? I'm Yu Honda. - Yu. - Yes. You go to high school? - Yes. - How old are you? I 7. Seventeen. Are you sorry? - Yes - How sorry? Like I've sinned. It's my original sin. Original sin? You're a Christian. You're a funny guy. Yu Honda, I 7 and Christian. A high school voyeuristic photo-maniac. Is this your church? I always come here to confess these things. You're funny. I'll forgive you too. If He forgives you, I should too. See you again. Incredible. Did you see that? He's a real man. Yu is great. - I was moved. - Me too. We want you to teach us. We don't have your passion. We're through with stealing and fighting. Please! Master! Have you got your cameras? Attention please. "The Art of Tosatsu." Careful, oblivious and bold. Repeat! Careful, oblivious and bold! Good, take your camera... My life was going through a change. I felt like I could forget about God, Dad and stuff... We all improved very quickly. You stood on my toe. - I didn't! - Get serious! Listen! All perverts were created equal. Let's try again, come on! Get away from me! Voyeur photo training... They are a bunch of morons. Everyone, finally we're going downtown tomorrow. This is what counts. Do what it tells you to do. And remember, be careful... oblivious and bold! Another great photo day! We became a tight team. Yu, standing by! Yuji, standing by. Senpai, standing by. Takahiro, standing by. A north north-east wind. Move it up! If there's a crutch in the east, I'll go. If there's one in the west, I'll run. Thanks, I'm "Tag" Yuji. Nice to meet you. The art of shoplifting was somehow similar. Now. Just like that. Now. I was having the time of my life. Until one day... - I'm home... - There you are. I'm cooking something delicious. I was worried because you stopped coming to church. There's someone I want you to meet. Something was about to happen. Something bad. Are you sleepy? Are you okay? It will take only a few minutes... Dad was a gentle priest again. We're given healing powers without knowing it Something would happen. Hi, it's been a while! You're all grown up. That woman... Why's she here? Don't look at me like that. See you later. "High school uniforms". Thank you very much. Yoko, Yoko! The girl is her daughter. Her ex-lover's daughter, to be exact. So they're not related? No. That slut Kaori will go back to the priest. What's your move? Maybe it's time for our plan. Drive alongside them. Gather up the guys. It's gonna happen soon. We'll be catching lots of fish. A whole bunch of suckers. Let's get to work! We had a dare and I lost. Let's commence the weekly meeting. - Today... - Hello, boys. Sis! Close the door! - Good Afternoon - Close it now! Bye now. There's a man I want you to meet. Again? I've had enough! Yoko, wait a minute! Leave me alone. Today's the day we pick the Photo of the Week! I think I'll beat you, Yu. You're confident, Takahiro. Bet your ass. Stand by! Very well then. If your panty photo is much better than mine... What will you do? I'll borrow your sister's clothes and wear them in public. That's not enough. What then? You walk around in drag and kiss a girl you like. And tell her you love her in a voice like a queer. I think you already know this but I won't kiss anyone until I find my Maria - Be a man! - Come on, this is a dare! - Aren't you confident? - Show us how manly you are! Alright, then. I have my pride as a pervert. To honour my pride... I'll do what you say if yours is better. Good. I, 2, 3! up pedestrian bridge steps. A whopper! Check this out. It's an ultra special royal flush! I lost... Here! Here. And here! Well? Strawberries... It's unbeatable, I'm the champ! The loser takes the penalty. I changed in front of a mirror. You look sweet! "3 minutes" I'm Miss Scorpion, the lady boss. Don't laugh! I walked like a cool chick. Like a lady boss would walk. It was funny. My friends came along to make sure I went through with it. Kiss Maria! Kiss Maria! Kiss Maria! Kiss Maria! I loved to be in drag. It made me feel good. I looked gross in the reflection. And then The life-changing event occurred. Look, what we've got here! Come with us. Come with us! Usually I would have ignored it. It was none of my business. Cut it out! Don't be cruel, come and play with us. I'll take you on! Good, I'll make you sorry! Come on, come on, come on! But on that day Yu, maybe it's your big chance. I couldn't pass on it. After all I was the lady boss. I was just joking! " I minute" What is it? Marry me! Marry me now! You scum! Stay away! This is my fight! Good for you! Leave the little girl alone and come to me! Shut up! Get her! - Come get me! - Shut up, idiots! Jesus, forgive these morons. Jesus? Fuck that! Don't disgrace the Lord's name! Forgive me for my sins. You're all mine! I'll beat you all up! We have to stop them! I want more! She was divine... She was Maria! Next moment I was in love. Move your asses, wimps! Chapter 2 - Koike My name is Aya Koike. I have I 7 occupations. This keeps away bad spirits. First I trade in bogus overpriced religious artefacts. I'm also the leader of a bogus charity group. Do it again! We need your help! Again! And I'm a cocaine dealer... I traffic cocaine through embassies. All the money goes to Zero Church. The truth is I'm the regional leader. I'm also the daughter of a man who is dying. This man was once known for being a model Christian. He had a respectable job. But not any more. He's actually not a man anymore. He's lost the symbol of his manhood. Because I snapped it off. He'd given me many lessons. I'm sorry! Discipline! - Forgive me. - No! I'm sorry. Swear to God! A long time ago when I was in class... this guy I liked looked at me. It was too much for me, because... It's a sin! - I love you. - Me too... Say it again. Me too. I couldn't hear you. It was too much for me... Your body's so obscene! Say sorry to God! I'm sorry! Say you're sorry in the name of Jesus Christ. Sorry! - Say, "Sorry my body's so obscene!" - I'm sorry! Say it properly! "Sorry my body's obscene!" Sorry my body's obscene. You want a soul? Ask for it! Say, "Give it to me!" - Give it to me! - Good. Give it to me! - Give it to me! - Give it to me! Louder! You deserve discipline now. You're a sinner! Give it to me! A sinner! - Give it to me! - A sinner! Give it to me... Hey, get away! Do you know what fucking is? Fucking is a sin, did you know that? Fuck... And being fucked. Fucking is an inhuman act! Stop having sex, assholes! Don't have sex! Filthy fuckers! When I came home from the reformatory... the man had collapsed from a stroke. He was absolutely still. As harmless as a toy. The joke was, he had a hard-on. Barely breathing with a hard-on. It was a perfect way for him to go. I left him like that for a while. I thought he might die. I could have killed him but I decided to let him live... as long as he quit being a man. So I snapped his erection off with my hand. It sounded good but it wasn't enough so I used scissors. Then I called the police. I bullshitted them. "He fell and broke off his thing. I wanted to ease the pain". "I panicked", etcetera. I went out, feeling liberated for the first time ever. That was when I met him. I found you! You found me? I know all about you. Come with me. What is this? The Zero Church. This is the answer for you. The answer... This is the end of your journey. There they kindly re-educated me. That's how I became who I am. He helped open my eyes. I can see clearly now. I still often ask him. Why did you pick me out of the crowd, that day? It was your smell. Smell? What could you smell? - Original sin. - Original sin? Not everybody can see original sins. Ordinary people don't even know what they are. But you were chosen by the Lord to detect original sins. The Lord is mischievous and torments his chosen ones. One night I found another original sinner. - Are you sorry? - Yes. How sorry? It's my original sin. It was so familiar to me. Why? I don't know. Let's go over it again. I, 2... To the right! Left! I've kept my eye on him ever since. I couldn't leave him alone. I don't know why. Father, I have a confession! Hey, Yu. I can increase Zero's believers with maximum efficiency. The plan involves the conversion of a family. We'll convert a Catholic family. I found this guy, Yu. Yu's father is a priest. He's respected by many local Catholics. By converting him, everybody from his church would convert to our church too. Maybe it won't work out like you think. Let me carry out my plan! Like a Shepard separates the sheep from the goats... The king separated his people. On his right hand side he put sheep. Goats on his left. I checked out all the people around Yu. Everything was in place. Let's go. I followed a girl named Yoko. She'd help my plan work. Yoko, it's your turn. I kick any guy in the ass. Chapter 3 - Yoko The name's Yoko. Yoko Ozawa. I was always so desperate. I was just some bitch who kept falling over 'till I met Kaori. This one? You'd look good in it. You chose a good high school. You look pale. Are you okay? Hey, are you really okay? Don't chew gum, that's why you keep collapsing! Spit it out! What's wrong with your hair? It's as messy as a bird's nest! You look scary. Don't hunch up! Straighten up your spine! That's it, great. You look like a corpse! Come on, buck up! And put a smile on your face. Each time we moved, I got a new school uniform. Yoko! That new uniform looks cute. Were you crying? Your make-up's smeared. No! Let's drive around. I used to live here. I know this neighbourhood well. Let's go! Where have you been? I moved back here. Really? With you back, this town will be exciting again. Thanks. This is my daughter. What? You've got a kid? My ex-lover's daughter. He was no good. But I love her so I took her with me. You love me more, don't you? Reporting from Honmoku High. I 0 hours have passed since the shooting began. According to a school official, at I 0 am today a second year female student began shooting. She was armed... Yoko, let's dance! The shooter shot all her classmates... I can hear something... The noise of this world. Her motivation is still unknown. Tension rises as... I was there... And I closed my eyes. Invisible bullets are flying everywhere I go. Nobody thinks that they'll be the one who's hit and dies. But those bullets are flying all over this peaceful town. Flying everywhere. For those who can see the bullets, death isn't an accident. It's like a knock on the door. They know it has come. Yoko! The asshole brought back another woman. Don't laugh so much. But look at her face. But you're her mother from today. At my part-time job I demolish houses. The job makes me feel good. Sometimes colleagues tell me that I get too carried away. Coz I smash anything I see. I'd think about the family who'd once lived there happily. How they'd fallen apart and moved out. The thought makes me both happy and disgusted. I get high when I destroy stuff. I have a dream of fulfilling my childhood fantasy. I just destroy everything in sight. And then there was Kaori. I figured she was just another one of those women who come and go every other month. Yoko, my daughter. Nice meeting you, I'm your Mum from today. Hi. Whatever. Let's go. I don't call the asshole, "Dad." He's a horny asshole. Patti Smith, The Nolan's, The Runaways, Joan Jett and the Pretenders. They are all women. Except for Kurt Cobain, oh, God I love him. All other men are scum, especially the asshole. Every single day, I screamed and screamed! When I got tired of screaming I picked fights with men. I beat the shit out of them. They are my enemies. All men are my enemies. Men! Men! Men! Die! The broken alarm clock. The cracked clock with the blood stain. Time stopped for me then. All men became my enemies from then on. Look at me. I won't. - Look at me. - I won't! I know you love me. Like Mother Theresa said... "Hatred is one way to express love." Liar. It's true. We're family, okay? Really, I want to fuck you. But I have to play the role of a good father. So I keep providing you with mothers. But you're the one I love the most. Bullshit! Don't fuck with me! You fucker! From then on all men became my enemies. They're all enemies. Men are my enemies. My daily routine was to fight off invisible enemies. How're you doing? - Good. - You hate men that much? Yeah. I think you should... have your hair like this. - Punk! - Punk! I grew to like Kaori. I don't know why. She always seems so exposed. Exposed to what? Exposed to love maybe. This is a news bulletin. Without warning, youths have begun rioting in Tokyo. As we speak, there are riots in Shibuya, Harajuku and other areas. Some are armed and have opened fire into the crowd... There's always a war on. And I'm the only one who knows it. An invisible war. The war that nobody knows is on. It seemed natural that Kaori became my best friend. Not a mother, but a friend. How about this? I love it. You might not believe this, but I'm a Christian. You mean you believe in God? Right. Is God cool? It's not about God. In Christianity, Jesus is the man. Jesus... Know anything about him? No. He's super cool, you know? Better than your Kurt Cobain. Men are scum but Kurt is an exception. Kaori made me read the Book about someone cooler than Kurt. "The New Testament" And I thought to myself that I could accept a man like Jesus. So cool! Can he be real? I confessed everything I could possibly think of to Jesus. Even about when the asshole touched me when I was little. But Jesus, I resisted him and did not have sex. If he came to me now, I could beat him up! Jesus, I approve of you as the only cool man besides Kurt Cobain I decided to expose myself more like Kaori. It's okay, isn't it? Give her the exact same one. I got the same tattoo as Kaori. I went for a drive with Kaori. I love Jesus Christ! I danced with Kaori. I'm bored with your father. She wanted to go back with her old lover. - Can I come? - I would go wherever she went. I wanted to escape from the silly old dream I always had. It's a cheap B-movie dream, starring the asshole. I protect my younger self. Jesus and Kaori will free me from the asshole. The guy who introduced me to Jesus is at this place we're going. Let's go! He's not quite as cool as Jesus or Kurt but... I'm kind of stuck on him. Promise me one thing. Be my friend, not my mother. Why's that? I don't want any more family. I've had enough! You're free to do anything with men. But don't make him my father. Don't worry. It's okay then. You're free to dance with any man. I'm free to dance as I please. I'm free to dance with Kaori. Next day, we visited Kaori's ex-lover. Recent events made me realise that I committed a sin of neglect. Because I was unaware of something... It came as a shock to me to notice that I'd hurt someone badly. He was so not attractive. But Kaori loved him so it was fine. The boring sermon ended. Yoko, go home first. Go for it. Go get him, Kaori. I have a confession to make. Father, please. Okay. I want to start over with you. I'm a stupid woman. I'm hopeless, I'm aware of that. But I just have to get back with you. Ever since I left you, I've been losing faith in God. When I was with you I could feel Him close... I miss God. I miss you. Can you forgive this stupid woman? You're not confessing to God... This is a place to confess to God. Don't act like it's not about you! Be a man. Remember me? You said I was some woman! This is a church and I'm a priest! I'm sorry, Father... But I can't stop myself from wanting you, Father. I always fantasise about sleeping in your strong arms. Please forgive me for that. Pray to God. I will, so forgive me. Lord forgives any sin. Will you forgive me? Not me, the Lord... Father! Father! - Father! - What do you want? Thank you for responding. Do you have a little time for me? The confession's over. Don't act like it's not about you! I'm God's shepherd! Stop it! Stop it! How familiar this is... We're in the church! Meet me outside! Get out of here. I'm sorry! It's filthy! Filthy? Let me go! Stop it! Tetsu, I'm lovesick for you - Stop it! - Stop it! Tetsu... Tetsu... Tetsu, I love you! I love you! Tetsu, I love you! Tetsu, don't leave me! Don't leave me! I won't let you! What's she doing? - Father. - Stop it! - Father! Stop that now! - Don't! - Love you! - Stop! - I love you! Stop it! You're so selfish! After what you put me through? I was wondering everyday. When would my Maria come? I photographed millions of panties. But none gave me a hard-on. None of them was Maria. I saw the woman at the church. I knew something was happening. I'll move back here. Dad came back. Why? There's someone I want you to meet. - It's been a while! - Something was happening. How have you been? I could feel it. Hell was on its way back. Introduce me to your Maria. Promise me. I'd been searching for my Maria taking panty photos and getting hit by Dad. Dad was suddenly friendly. - Is it delicious? - Yes. He was eating meals with me... And the fateful day arrived. - What do you think of the Priest? - Like what? I want us all to become a family. A family. I want to be your real mother. - No! - What's wrong? I have had enough of families! Hey! Do what you like with any guy but I don't want a family! What's wrong with you? Shut up! Yoko! I just kept walking away... Shut up! Going in the direction of my destiny. I didn't care anymore. I knew Dad would get back with that slut. It's an ultra special royal flush! Who gives a damn? So I put a wig on. And I walked to where my destiny waited. I stood where destiny was waiting. Look, what we've got here! Come with us. Come with us! Cut it out! Don't be cruel, come play with us. I'll take you on! Good, I'll make you sorry! Come on, come on, come on! Yu, maybe it's your big chance. I was just joking! They were all my enemies. My enemies on a silver platter and I'd eat them all up. Chapter 4 - Miss Scorpion Who is she? Who is she...? Who's that helping me fight? Protect her! Who is she? You'll pay for this! Not in a million years! Who are you? Thank you. That was so helpful. And you were so cool. It's nothing. Those wimps... That was great. My name is Yoko. Thank you so much. What is your name? Miss Scorpion. I... I'm Miss Scorpion. Nice to meet you. Miss Scorpion? Yes, don't forget that, honey. Come on, kiss her now. And the wind blew her skirt up... My first hard-on! Come on. You're a darling. I like you. See you. My prayers have been answered! What's this feeling? I've never felt like this... What do you call this feeling? I finally had a hard-on. What's this feeling? My heart hurts... I want to photograph these panties! This is a hard-on! The hard-on of a man! This is what a man is made of! I did it, I did it! Who are you? Who is she? What was that? I'll try this area. Is that a good move? Captain? - Captain! - Hey, Captain. Are you okay? Sorry, guys. I have a shooting schedule written up. We'll be staking out between those points. Okay, each of us station here, here and... Here, at points A, B, C and D. We know that. Oh, you do? Well, we'll stake out at those points. Next week, we'll choose the Grand Prix photo. Let's go get them! How you doing there? No big waves yet. We have a nice south-east wind. Put your faith in it and you'll be okay. Roger. I'm finished. I can't function anymore. Hey. How are you? More photos? Oh, it's you. I'm glad we met. What's wrong? Chin up. Right... Bye. She's the one. The next day, an unbelievable thing happened. We have a new student. Her name is Yoko Ozawa. Come in. I'm Yoko Ozawa, nice to meet you. And she walked in. There's a seat, you can sit there. Yes. Stupid teacher, stupid classroom... Stupid men. I've had enough of this. Nice to meet you... A fake ambush... All men, die. Thank you, Father for your love and the food on the table. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen. I want to talk to you. What is it? Remember I said I wanted you to meet somebody? Yes. We're having dinner with that person tomorrow. All I can think of is her. Why? What did that dream mean? Maybe Kaori would know. So I asked her. Kaori. Do you masturbate? No! I'm a Christian! Christians don't masturbate? No... I don't think so. Sorry... What about? That I walked away from you. Oh, that? What's going on? God is incredible! It was divine intervention. Because you ran away from me, I felt empowered... and then I raped him beautifully. "A beautiful rape?" Right. After you left, I made frantic love to him! That did it for him. Thanks to you and the Lord above. Whatever. Is it a sin to be a lesbian? Oh, yeah. An unredeemable sin. Why do you ask? No reason... Dykes are perverts. Watch out for them. Perverts? I didn't care anymore who Kaori wanted to marry. Yoko. What? Maybe you don't want me to? What? I want to marry him. Marry him... Oh, marriage. I had much more important things to think about. Go right ahead. - Can I? - Sure. So, maybe I am a... Maria is so close to me... And she has no idea who I am. Maybe I am a... What should I do? Maybe I'm a lesbian. Maybe the only way for me to meet her is in drag. Maybe it's possible that I love Miss Scorpion. Make up your mind! Hello, it's Miss Scorpion. I hope you weren't hurt? Thanks for helping me. It was nothing, really. Whenever I see men harassing a damsel, I blow my fuse. Men are horrible. Yes, they're all horrible. I love you, Miss Scorpion. I love you too, Yoko. I want to be with Miss Scorpion. Me too... But I'm not Scorpion... Yoko... I'm in love with her! Good morning. Hi. Wait a minute... Don't I remind you of someone? Look at me and think. Well...? But wait...! It's Renaissance humanism. I guess you know the word "humanism." It's a human-centric philosophy. Write that down please. It persisted throughout the Middle Ages and Modern Times. Modern Times starts around the I 6th Century... What do you want from me? I'm asking you a question! You dumb-ass! Stay away from me! Or you'll get hurt. Hello... Senpai! Meet me with the costume! The Scorpion costume! Here she comes. Shit! - Don't forget the hat. - She's coming! She's almost here! Go get her! My God! Miss Scorpion! Oh, is it Yoko? Hi, Miss Scorpion, good to see you! How have you been? Good. Do you live around here? Yes, over there somewhere. Yeah! I'm happy to hear that. I'm happy to see you again. I'm so happy. Me too... Oh, sorry... It's okay. Miss Scorpion? Yes. What? Oh, nothing. - What? - It's nothing. Come on, don't be a tease. Is it weird if a woman loves another woman? Mother tells me it's perverse. Do you think so too? I don't know but even a pervert has a life history. Life is what you make it, being a pervert is just one way of life. Oh, I see... Yoko, don't look down at perverts. Keep that in mind. Now go home, it's dangerous with those punks around. Here's my number. Call me if you need me. Miss Scorpion! Here! Can you live with this? I'll confess to her someday. Yeah, you should. I'll tell her how I feel about her. Good for you! Unbelievably it got worse. The worst came that very night. I dread meeting that woman again... There she is. It's Kaori. Did you miss her? We met in the street. Really? Sit down everybody. Just like the old days. I'm so glad we're together again. And then somebody walked in. You're late! And it was... Hello, I'm Tetsu Honda. - I'm Yoko. - This is Yoko. Bummer... Say something. I'm Yu. Let's sit down. Nice to meet you. Here I go... Yoko, Yu. We have something to tell you. I guess it's better if we do this before we get started. We're thinking of getting married. He'll be my brother? But you're a priest. I thought you couldn't marry. So I'm thinking of quitting. To be with her, I'll go back to just being a Christian. Can you do that? I need to wait until Vatican approves it... The point is that I'm not good enough to be a priest. Besides I don't want to sneak around like we did before. Yu's birthday is in July. And Yoko's is in December. You'll be his little sister by 5 months. I'm going to the toilet. Did I make her feel bad? No. Maybe it was too abrupt... It must be Yoko. Excuse me. Yoko needs Scorpion! Maybe it was too soon. - What's going on? - Take it easy. Hello? - Miss Scorpion! - What's up? Sorry to bother you but I'm going to be moving to your neighbourhood. Oh, that's great! Mother drags me round, I'm used to it, but... Sorry to call you up like this. It's no problem. I'm with my new family at a restaurant now. And they are... They are...? Really disgusting. The new father and brother. Especially the brother is... creepy. Creepy... He follows me around like a stalker. And I have to live with him! He's a pervert. A pervert... Yoko. Remember? Perverts have reasons for being what they are. We'd be called lesbians and that's pretty perverse. That pervert of yours has reasons for being like that. I know! Maybe he was trying to... connect to you as a brother. You'll be his sister, right? Maybe he knew about this all along. That must be it. He's known about you from before. So he doesn't mean anything weird or perverse. Maybe he's just enthusiastic about having a sister. Maybe he's trying to be a good brother. He sounds earnest. Oh, I figured him wrong then! Do you love me? Of course I do. Then promise me. Can you treat him like a brother? - Yes... - I can't hear you. - Yes. - I love you. Me too. Keep your promise, okay? Call me if you need me. Yes. Thank you, Miss Scorpion. Bye. Shit! You want to check on her? She's okay. Sorry. See? Yoko Ozawa. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. I don't want her to be my sister! And so Yoko and I now lived under one roof. Breakfast is ready! - Good morning! - Morning! Thank you, Father for your love and the food on the table. In the name of our Lord, Jesus... In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen, let's eat. Yes, let's! As we said grace, I glimpsed at Yoko. I'd get a bulge in my pants whenever I looked at her. Now getting a hard-on felt like a sin. It was difficult keeping my promise with Miss Scorpion. Dad. Yes? I have a confession. No, you don't need to. I'm too ashamed to tell him anyway... Sorry I made you do that. I was out of line then. I'm fragile like you. After all, we're only human. Sorry. From today I have to call him my brother... I have to do it for Miss Scorpion. Brother... Good morning! You'll be late for school! Good morning... The only way I could call him Brother was by shouting it. We had nothing to talk about. That's right! See that street over there? That's where Miss Scorpion saved me. She is super cool! Why do I have to hear her rave on about Scorpion? I had nothing to say to him so I ended up talking about Scorpion. Oh, maybe it's funny if... What? If we go in together. You go ahead. It's okay. We're family. You're so self-conscious! I'm just acting here, stupid! We're not family. They're not married yet. Shut up, I know that already! It's almost time to begin. Watch out Yu and little sis, I'm on my way. Hey, they're a couple! Go for it! The hottest new couple of the century! Yuck, this is annoying. Okay, all right! Enough already. Calm down! Cosecant. These are the 3 functions. How are these 3 defined? Oh, he is so gross... But I made a promise to Miss Scorpion. I'm going to take a bath. Okay. What's wrong? Are you upset about something? Don't you feel like it? Not in the mood? Any problem? Let go of me! What's going on? I want to go to a club. - A nightclub? - I feel like dancing. How can you go out when you have a man like me? I might meet a better man. - Yoko! - Yes? Let's go out! Wait a minute. - You coming too? - No! You have me, you're my... I'm your...? What am I to you anyway? Wife. What? I can't hear you! - My wife. - Your wife? When did we get married? We haven't but you're almost my wife. I'm almost your wife? How idiotic! I'm tired of sneaking around! Just wait a bit more. This is just like before! Wait just a while. These things take time... What are you doing? - Let's dance. - What, like this? Just like we used to! Just until the Vatican approves it. I'll go wherever you go, Mum. - Men suck! - Oh, yeah! I'll quit being a priest this minute... You're a liar! Be nice to each other. Listen to what Yoko said. No fighting? We'll be together forever. Kiss me. Kiss me passionately so I can forget about being cranky. I'll do my best. - Best? - Here I come. Miss Scorpion? I know it's late... It's okay. What is it? I... I really love you, Miss Scorpion. Sorry... I'm being annoying. I'm just being pushy... - I've gotta go. - No, it's no problem, Yoko. I really love you too. Call me any time, I'm always here for you. Thank you. Me too... I love you too... I love you too. Sorry about what I said. Don't be. It's because I've been careless. I'm really sorry. I'll quit tomorrow. And we'll get married right away. That's great! It's a promise. I'm so happy! Are you all prepared? I'm counting on you tomorrow. We have many new students this month. Are we going to get another one? That's right. Come in. This is Aya Koike, your new classmate. Nice to see you all. Make sure you're all nice to her. Where should she sit? Sir, I want to sit there. No problem. Where is Scorpion? I heard that she was here! It's payback time! - Who are you guys? - You? Are you Scorpion? I'm Scorpion! I am Scorpion. You? You're the talk of the town... Miss Scorpion? It's impossible. You say you want to quit... But it's beyond my authority. That's how little you think of the Lord? Weren't you determined to become a priest? You've made me very upset. I realise my inadequacy. But... You'd rather choose romance? Is that what it is? Tetsu. I'll pretend I didn't hear any of this. Go to the chapel and pray. Pray to God with all your heart. I'm sorry. You're saying you tried to stop those gangsters and... it was an involuntary act of self defence? Right. I had no idea what was going on... What's this Scorpion thing? I have no idea what that was about either. I just had to act on it... I see. I know it seems unbelievable but I have a black belt in karate. So I was quite sure that I could deal with those men. I couldn't stop myself. For everyone's sake... I understand now. You just tried to protect your classmates. That's what happened. I'm really sorry. I misunderstood you. You may go now. Yes. Excuse me. Miss Scorpion...? Yoko. Is it true? But you're... I look kind of different, don't I? You can go now. When I'm Scorpion, I wear dark glasses and make-up. With elevated boots. But now I can see you without wearing that stuff. - You're really... - Really! I'm Miss Scorpion, the one who saved you that day. When your skirt blew up, only I could see your panties. Miss Scorpion... I was happy when you said you loved me on the phone. Put out your tongue. I'll bite it. Does it hurt? No. How about that? It doesn't hurt. The story was written around the 9th Century. It goes, "Long ago, there was an old bamboo cutter." I'm sure you're all familiar with this story. There was someone I ought to meet. Someone I hadn't met for 30 years. I believed she was my mother. What are you doing, Yu? You have a cute little sister. What are you doing? Are you upset with me? What are you doing here? I'm interested in you. Who are you? Me? Someone who is interested in you. What are you trying to do? You're not doing it very much these days. Doing what? Panty photos. I know everything! You, bad boy. Do you want me to tell Yoko that you photographed my panties? What are you two doing? That's unfair! Stop it, Brother! I'm not your brother! They not even married yet so you're not my sister. So don't call me Brother. Enough is enough! I'm fed up with this! What's with him? He just needs some space. I'm home. Hi, Honey. Hi... What's wrong? Tell me what's wrong! Are you okay? Yeah, don't worry. Sorry. Guess what! Aya Koike is going to help me with my homework. She's going to come everyday after school. I never imagined that Miss Scorpion would be my tutor. Yu, you should try harder. Thank you, Father, for your love and for the food on the table. In the name of... Let's forget grace today. Why don't we just eat... Okay... All right. I had that feeling again. Something was about to happen. And I'm always right. Hello. And you are...? I told you! She's my tutor, Koike! Oh, it's you! - Pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Come in. Come on! It was so pushy the way she became Yoko's tutor suddenly. What did she want from us...? She's suddenly all over us, closing in on me. What's up? Can I come in? It should be okay... Right snoop? So this is what your room's like... She soon became a regular part of the family. Even Dad and Kaori were getting along with her. Before I knew it, Koike was eating dinner with us. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, amen. Looks delicious! Sometimes, she stays over. I'm Miss Scorpion. Leave the little girl alone and come to me! Thank you so much, my name is Yoko! It's unbearable. Things are not working well... At night Koike even counsels my so-called parents. My faith in the Lord is getting shakier recently. I'm a horrible priest. When I close my eyes to pray to God, I see Kaori's face instead. I'm not... suited to being a priest. It's a sin. I'm a sinner. I believe that the Lord is very generous. He will forgive you. You'll be fine. Let's all pray to Him. Great photos! Where is my costume? You stole it! It's under the bed. I returned it after I had fun making out with your sister. You bitch! What will you do? I'll play dead so you can fly away... like a little birdie. What's it all for? No reason. Just fly away, little birdie. Yoko is mine now. - It's Scorpion. - Oh? Meet me at the park, right now. - Koike? - Just hurry. You took so long... Have you forgotten me? Oh, I see. You've been hanging around with that phoney... so now you're confused. I'm the real Scorpion. But even... this is a lie. Can you guess who I really am? It's me, Yoko. - It's Yu. - No! I am Scorpion. I'm sorry I deceived you. Yoko, listen to me please. Wait! I fucked up... They're almost mine. "Peek-a-Panty" - What's this? - What's going on? "Peek-a-Panty photo journal by Y" Good morning. What are these? What's this? - Oh, my God! - They are so gross! Morning, Brother. Good morning. What's wrong with your brother? "King of Perverts". He's here! Hail to the King Pervert! What's this? What has Yu done to deserve this? Tons of perverse photos, that's what! Maybe there are photos of you too. I advise you not to come to school anymore. Principal? He's expelled. That's what he's been doing. Like you told me before, Yu really is... a disgusting pervert. Tetsu, please don't! - Listen... - You pervert! What have you done...? Stop it! Get out! Yoko, you've got it wrong. Stop it! Leave her alone, pervert! Yu, stop it! You're such an idiot! Yoko... Yoko, I love you! You stole Yoko's panties and hid them in your room! - Pervert! - Yoko, I love you. Pervert. Could you get off me please? Hey pervert. Get off me! You two are responsible for the way your son turned out! He can't be blamed. Your immorality has helped create this pervert! It's time to change your ways. You must change! Hey, pervert. You want me to hit you more? Yes, hit me more, please. Come on! Don't worry. For Yoko's sake, we must start afresh, right? Yu. You must be cold. See, this one says 50% Off. It'll reduce your sorrow by 50%. What's funny? Are things okay at home? I snuck into school sometimes. We'll learn about the Kamakura Government's political system. Neither Yoko or Koike were there. Yu, what's up? Hey. How have you been? I don't see Yoko. Isn't she here? Your sister? I haven't seen her recently. Is she okay? Well... How about Koike? I haven't seen her either. They stopped coming about the same time. I'm worried... Something's wrong. I hadn't gone home in ages, it was deserted. So I went to the church. The church was in a panic after Dad's disappearance. One thing was clear, my family had vanished. And Koike too. That was that. Anything can happen in life. It was deserted? All your family's gone? How's it possible? Sounds like the families of those Zero Church members. What's that? The religious cult? Don't you watch TV? They kidnap the whole family. Put them in a camp and brainwash them. Right. Oh yeah, that! Yu's family has probably been abducted by them. Koike must have been their recruiter. It could be. They'd do anything to get converts. Everyone, today... from our hearts we will confess all. Reveal the sins you've committed that you've never told anybody. Relieve yourself of that burden. You start. I'm... I'm undisciplined when it comes to sex. I was a priest, but that didn't stop me... I wasn't worthy. We all sin. It's only natural. Go on. I was there to serve God but... I fell in love with her and I just had to be with her. You didn't just want to be with her, did you? What do you mean...? You wanted sex from her, correct? You just wanted the sex. Yes, you're correct. I wanted to have sex with her. You felt guilty and physically abused your son. The Lord told me so, Tetsu. You hit him when your son confessed his sexual sins. The Lord knows everything. I'm sorry. Confess your sins. How's it going? Where's Yoko? Don't get so excited. What's wrong? I can't find Yoko anywhere. She's here with us. We are all living in love and peace here. Where the fuck is "Here"! Calm down. What's going on? I want you to meet some people tomorrow. They think you're very talented. What's going on? "Bukkake-sha" at 1 pm? That's a famous porn video company! What is it, Yu? What's with "Bukkake-sha"? I have to go there. What for? Is it for an audition? "Bukkake-sha Audition" Let me be direct. What do you like? Sex. I love sex and only sex. Good for you! Next, Mr. X. That's me. So you're a pervert. I hear you're a big pervert. Yes sir, I'm a pervert. Tell us how perverse you are. I just can't stop loving pussy! Next, Yu Honda. Do you like pussy too? No. I'm into sins. Sins? I started doing peek-a-panty photos because I had to sin. Not because it turns me on. Because it was sinful. When you say "sins" do you mean crimes? No, biblical sins. I... I'd never had a hard-on until I met this wonderful person. When I saw her panties, I realised how beautiful they were. That was the moment that I became a real pervert. Bravo. Bravo! Congratulations! Where's Yoko? Where's she? Don't be rough. Why are you here? At my school, my house! Everywhere I go. Where's Yoko? She's having an awakening. What's that? It's time for your awakening too. Okay, original sin boy? I'm not taking any more of those photos! If you don't work hard, you won't see Yoko. Let go. If you tell your friends about meeting us, you won't see Yoko. If you want to see her, work for Bukkake-sha. Will I really see Yoko? What? Will you let me see her? If I work for them, will I really get to see Yoko? I'll let you see her. That's great! Does it mean that we are pros now? I guess so. Takahiro. Yuji. Senpai. And Yu. I see a gleam in your eyes. Your eyes are cameras! That's what this industry lacks! You all have that gleam in your eyes! Those camera eyes! You'll take the industry by storm! Look! The Tosatsuenre sells in the thousands today! You see? It costs nothing but yields millions! It's up to you now! Yes, sir! I made up my mind. I'm a Super-duper Pervert. I guess that's what I am. Shoot them all, and think that they are Yoko. Since then, I photograph panties and think of her. I'm unstoppable. I'm a pervert! The king of perverts! It's time you poke some pussy. Poke some pussy? There's a huge variety of porn and most of it isn't just pussy hidden in panties. Most porn involves some pussy and with it some poking... Poking... I've had my eye on you, the King of Perverts. I want you to do the Rape 'em 'till They Drop sequel and Poke 'em Numb part 6 and 7. Hey, wait a minute... Do you want me to... Yes, you get to poke them! Poke them and peck them like a woodpecker! Be a man!... A pervert is one thing. Poking is another! Or be a pervert! My identity's at stake. - Boss, please! - Yes? You've got to understand. I'll never stop shooting peek-a-panty for you. But I can't peck them... - What? - Please! What kind of a man are you? Don't you wanna peck? I'm sorry. You get paid for having sex. I know you always have a hard-on! This bulge is reserved for the pecking of my Maria. It's not for anybody else but her. I declined any job except for peek-a-panty. I had to appear in a weirdo-event instead. Bukkake-sha presents the I 0th Perverts Jamboree! We have perverts gathered from all over Japan. We have something special today. It's the Perv Confessional and... we have the I 8-year-old Prince of Peek-a-Panty! Yu, the son of an immoral Catholic priest! He's here to listen to your confessions! Come and confess your sins! I'm sorry... I can only love little kids. I forgive you. I love to eat women's vomit... I forgive you. Thank you so much. Next. I ended up doing what Dad used to do. Like I'm the God of perverts. As the priest for confused perverts... I created a Trinity of Perverts, Perv God, the Father and the Son. I forgive you. - Next. - I can't help stalking women. Forgiven. I really like eating hair, any kind of hair... - Forgiven. - I like doctors and nurses... - Forgiven. - ...a princess... - Forgiven. - Earwax turns me on... - Forgiven. - Only Papa can... When I'm with a man... - I'm really... - Next. - When I see men's things... - Forgiven. - When I see my own blood... - Forgiven. I made a bomb! I want to blow up a crowded place... Forgiven... What was that? I made a bomb. Can I detonate it? It'll be awesome when it explodes! Don't do that yet. I'll talk with you later. Thank you! It'll be an awesome party! - Yes. Next. - Oh, is that all? Enough make-up. - More? - No! It's scary enough. Next please. We promised to let you see her. You worked hard. It's time you learned something about us. Yoko, confess to this pervert priest. I used to think I was a lesbian. But I was just confused. It helped me to acknowledge the mercy of God almighty. God used my lust and ego to lead me to the promised land. How long has it been since you saw Yoko? Yoko knows your gift for peek-a-panty, right? Yes. I see something ugly in his heart. - It's hideous. - Very hideous. Do you pity him? I do. The love of your life says she pities you. Come with us right now. You don't have to do this anymore. You'll find out all about us today. Look us up. We'll be waiting. I'll be waiting. My perv-o-meter is revving up to the max and higher! Higher than Mount Everest! How are you all doing with your perv-o-meter? Come quickly! Yoko's on TV! That other woman is on, too! Live from the Zero Church. - Come on, Yu! - Is she on? No, but they're repeating the same footage. One of the cultists attempted suicide and... - There! - That's her. You have the wrong idea about our facility. Hail to the Perverts! We have the Prince of Perverts with us. Let's hear it! He looks like he's up to something... "Cave"... "Actor" "Prompter". Where is your sister now? At the Zero Headquarters. That cult has a caste system, classified as Prompters, Actors and Caves. We can only help those in the early stages of the Caves. They are less integrated so we can deprogram them. But deprogramming the Actors and the Prompters is almost impossible for us. Once their roots are established so to speak, we can't help. New recruits can be pulled out of there relatively easily. What's your sister? She's an Actor. Oh, no... Nobody can help her. Not even us... That won't do! Aren't you priests? What about being the shepherd of lost sheep? - We're busy. - Busy with what? We have a lot to do. What do you mean? Many little things. We have a lot to do. Oh, God's too busy to save her... That's not it. That's what it is! What are you so busy with? You have so much passion because you have only one to help. We have hundreds of victims to take care of. We can't dedicate ourselves to one person. You're in the porn business, correct? It's immoral and petty... That kind of work is shameless. You are powerless against them. Don't look down at us. Sorry. But I'll tell you this. You turned her to Zero Church. Think about it. Say that again! Let me be clear. We don't want to be involved with people like you. - Fuckers! - Takahiro, stop! Going berserk won't do us any good! We'll do more research on Zero! To brainwash them they go through steps. After the Bible study sessions, the victims go on a camp. The victims are confined until indoctrination is completed. It might take weeks until the process is completed. Until they become one of them. Are you from the press? No. We don't like people loitering around here. "...we decided to ask Him about it. We prayed to him." "We told him that we put our faith in him." We found your sister nearby. Come right now! We'll be standing by. Okay! Yoko. It's me, Yu! Remember? It's not working. Let's do this our way. Abduct her! Yoko, listen to me! Come on, Yoko, look at me! Yoko, can't you remember me? Yu, get in! This is the only way! Come on, close the door! - Let me go! - We want to help you. Help me? Let me go, perverts! Where are we going? Let me go! I said let me go! Let go of me, perverts! Let go of me! Put her in! Get the chair! Pervert... pervert. Pervert. Pervert. It'll take a while. Here. Thank you. I had to break into your house for this. Thanks a lot. We'll leave you two alone. Hungry? I see... What's funny? I just remembered... when you came to the park in the Scorpion costume. I screwed up, didn't I? - Want this? - No. - Wanna sleep? - No. So? Didn't you sleep at all? Did you eat anything? I won't eat until Yoko does. On a hunger strike, huh? Hang in there. Good luck. I'm not cold. Right. Hungry? Okay... It hurts... Does it? I'm sorry. Are you okay? Get off me, pervert! Let go, pervert! That again? Pervert! What's wrong with being a pervert? You understand nothing! Come back to this side! What side? To the real world! You mean your world Your world is not... So I'm a pervert! You might think I'm one... Don't call me you! A person like you... You're a pervert by anybody's standards! Who cares about the standards of normal people? Listen to me! You're definitely a misfit, and I can live with that. But I don't want you to belong to Zero! - Stay with me. - Let go! - Stay! - Let go! Let me go! Do you know Corinthians I 3 I don't. Love, the greatest of them all. If I speak in the tongues of men and angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. And if I have prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, but have not love, I am nothing. And if I dole out all my goods, and if I deliver my body that I may boast but have not love, nothing I am profited. Love is long suffering, love is kind, is not jealous, it is not inflated and does not boast, It is not discourteous, it is not selfish, it is not irritable, it does not enumerate the evil. Love never falls in ruins, but whether prophecies, they will be abolished, or tongues, they will cease or knowledge, it will be superseded. For we know in part and we prophecy in part. But when the perfect comes, the imperfect will be superseded. When I was an infant, I spoke as an infant, I reckoned as an infant, when I became an adult, I abolished the things of the infant. For now we see through a mirror in an enigma, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know as also I was fully known. But now remains faith, hope, love! These three. But the greatest of these is... Love! You don't even know these words. That sex-maniac priest taught you nothing about the Bible! You know nothing about God! Are you talking about Dad? Yes! And now he's becoming a better person. Don't call him a sex-maniac! Did you ever think about God when you lived with him? Come to the church with me and we'll talk. If you want to be at one with God we can talk about Him with others at church! I'm already with the Zero Church. Zero is not God's church, it's just a sham! What about you? I'm a pervert but not a phoney! I am a pervert with dignity. If you want something holy, choose a deity, Buddha, Mohammed or Jesus Christ. But not the Zero Church! Zero is nowhere near Jesus, Buddha nor Mohammed! Zero is just lies! Liar! - Who is? - Liar, liar! - Why? - You're the one who lied! You stole my pants, pretended to be Scorpion and never told God! Huh, pervert boy? I know I am a timid liar. But I won't hold this back. You're being deceived. I'll get you back from them! I'll never give up! Let me go! I'll get you back, Yoko. Let go of me! I'll get you back. Let go, you idiot! Who do you think you are? Corinthians I 3. But have not love, I am nothing. And if I dole out all my goods, and if I deliver my body that I may boast but have not love, nothing I am profited. Love is long suffering, love is kind, it is not jealous, not inflated and does not boast, It is not discourteous, it is not selfish, it is not irritable, it does not enumerate the evil. It covers all things, it has faith for all things, it hopes in all things, it endures in all things. Love never falls in ruins... I want to go out and see the sea. I won't run away, I promise. I promise. Yoko, get up quickly! Get up, Yoko! Are you hurt? Did he hurt you? Sorry, we screwed up! Is this the boy you told me about? Yes. Look, Yoko's in a good position. You love Yoko, huh? Please don't! Yoko, look. He's beaten up but he still gets a hard-on. Well? You want it cut off? Your name is Yu, right? You're so disgraceful. You get an erection so easily. Cut it off. Come on. Do it now. You hate him, don't you? Come on! Do it now! Stop it! Yoko, I can't help it. Sorry but whenever I see you, I get a hard-on. Pervert! I love her! Shut up, pervert! Come on, Yoko! I'll try not to get a hard-on. That's not enough. We'll discipline you at the Church. We'll make sure that you never get hard. She's right. You and your sinful boner need to be trained by us. Okay, I'll join you. Yoko, well done. This is dangerous like your little weenie. I'll keep my eye on it. Good morning. Isn't this a wonderful place? Read this carefully. Good morning. When you reach this spiritual level, you'll be a Prompter, not an Actor. She became a Prompter at such a young age. You know what prompters do? They remind the actors of the lines they forgot. We'll check on you later. If you get a hard-on when you see Yoko... I won't get hard! That's good. Give it to me. Give it to me... You're all in a state similar to cave dwellers. Plato wrote the cave allegory. The cave dwellers don't see the light of the fire. They merely see the shadows on the cave wall. That's the state you are in now. You might have thought that being uninhibited was freedom. You're wrong... Yes, ma'am? I see you're studying hard. Are you liberated from your libido? Please don't... I told you that I was interested in you. Please don't! You're different from other men. Why is that? Please stop... Tell me. Why is it? I'm just a... Just what? You can get hard, you know... You're just pretending to study hard to deceive us? Right, Yu? Original sin boy! Good girl. You stole my heart away I'm a cave, a great big cave You took everything away from me I'm a cave, I'm happy. A stupid kid comes running through me Working hard? Yes, it feels great! Wanna go to training camp? Training camp? For I week at Mt. Fuji. You'll meditate better and it'll help your transition. Great, I'd love to go! Good morning, everybody. Good morning. Let's start with a word you associate with an empty cave. You start. - Cicada shells. - An empty bottle. - A snake's skin. - A tunnel. Love. A black hole. - Fame. - Ground Zero! This is the most important night of your training. All of you will confess everything. Let go of all your pains and tribulations. Then you will climb out of the empty cave that you are... and be born again as an Actor. After my father died, Mother became manic depressive... Since my son became antisocial... I was sick as a child... I loaned money to my friend and ended up going bankrupt with him. Yu Honda, your turn. I was wrong not to... look in the eyes of the girl I love, put my face to hers. I could not open up to her. I should have been honest with her about everything. That was a detour but now I learned a lesson. I won't be ashamed of it. My hard-on. No, let me rephrase it. It's holier than a hard-on. It's about love. "Yoko Ozawa has meetings every Tuesday at I pm, at Headquarters". The Zero Church appreciates your support helping those in need of charity. Please support our cause. The Zero Church appreciates your support helping those in need of charity. Please support our cause. Oh my God! Are you really going to do it? I know you can do it! You're the best! I'd love to go with you. Next time. Oh, too bad! I envy you so much! Just press this one. It's easy but totally destructive. Woo, I envy you! So you're serious... Yes. Here's the stuff you asked for. Love never falls in ruins... When I was an infant, I spoke as an infant, I reckoned as an infant, but... when I became an adult, I abolished the things of the infant. For now we see through a mirror in an enigma but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know as also I was fully known. But now remains faith, hope, love! These three. But the greatest of these is love. Good afternoon. Can I see your passport? Yu Honda, Area 5. Who do you want to meet? Yoko Ozawa on the 6th floor. Go ahead. Yu Honda, Area 5, wants to come up to the 6th floor. Let him come. You're Yu, aren't you? Delicious. - It's hot! - Be careful. Oh, I forgot to eat. Can I have more please? It makes me feel warm. This one's not cooked yet... Hey, there he is! We were waiting for you! Miss Scorpion's here! Let him go. Get up, Scorpion. You can all go now. You found us. Very good. Shut up! Hurry up and die. We're quite okay, Yu. The ones you killed can be replaced easily Yu, remember them? Your former family members. Yu, open your eyes. Yu. Listen to your family. You've made a detour. But now you can live without a disguise. You can be Scorpion with no costume. Or do you still need the wig? Your bad behaviour has disappointed Yoko. Yoko! Yu, wake up! Yoko, Come with me. It's me, your brother! You're not acting like one! Yoko, come with me. We are a family! It's me, remember? Hooray! Nobody will hear you anyway! Hip, hip! Let them hear me! What did you do? You think nobody heard that? The police will be here for you. Yoko, come with me. No! I won't let you go! Let her go! Yoko, come on! Yoko, don't listen to this lunatic! I love Yoko more than God! I love her. I love you. I love you. I love you! I love you... ever since the moment I first met you... Yoko, finish him off! You people are all hopeless! You're beyond help! Yu, come on. Yu, listen to me. You're the same as me... Yu, get a grip! Yu, you can fall apart now. Yu, listen to me. Yu, it's me, Dad. Go ahead, fall apart. Fall apart, Yu. Fall apart... Yu. Into a million pieces... Give it to me. More on the bomb attack at Zero Headquarters. The police indicate that someone with a grudge was responsible for the bomb. Investigations will reveal more about this controversial cult. Last Chapter Zero Church was expanding like a forest fire but now it's on the verge of non-existence. It's accused of abducting members' families... the police are investigating all the Zero facilities The cult's leader still hasn't been found. Tetsu and Kaori joined a victim support group. Everybody, it's another beautiful exercise day! Follow my cue... Now, I, 2, 3... I, 2, 3... I love you. Love you too. Forever. Yoko went to live with relatives. - Let's eat. - Thank you for the food. Thank you... Go on, tuck in Yoko. Mum's not a good cook. Don't say that! She's right. No! You don't think so do you, Yoko? The fantastic world of Peek-a-Panty! Yu Honda, the Prince of Tosatsu. You have to have love and devotion. Go with a noble spirit. Careful, oblivious and bold! Never to be seen by your targets. And... find your true love amongst millions of women! What's up? Nothing. Have you ever been in love? I'm in love, really in love. He's so cool, a bit shy... He's like a prince, like someone who'd rescue me! He's kind of short but really dignified. All the girls want to be his girlfriend. But I won't lose to them! He has style. He wants his girlfriend to call him by his first name, like in a movie! And did I say he's cool? I'll show you his picture. I'll get one now. Come on! It's Miss Scorpion! Hey, that's enough. Scorpion bullies me! Are you crying? Recently my tears have become blood... Can you see? Are they red? It is blood. I'm sure it's true. Tears come through blood vessels. So when I cry really hard... blood comes out too. You think I'm weird... Sorry. Good night. Are you crying too? I... I used to think I understood everything. But I actually understood nothing. I didn't know it. You didn't? I understood nothing. I didn't realise that I understood nothing. Miss Scorpion. Good morning, Miss Scorpion. Great weather. Breakfast is ready. Yu? Oh, him! He's in the recreation room. Thank you. Hello... Brother? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you... My name's Miss Scorpion. What's yours? It's Yoko. My name is Yoko. Hello, Yoko. What do you think of my clothes? Do you like them? Yes, you look so good. Yeah? I'm happy you said that. They're my favourite. Do I look good? You look beautiful... Are you crying, darling? I'm okay... Anything sad happened? It's okay... Call me if you have any problems. I'm Scorpion. Nobody can defeat me, okay? Okay. Thank you. Miss Scorpion. Let's go to your room. Oh, already? Yoko, I'll see you again. Can I go to the room too? Certainly. How's Scorpion today? Very stable. Good. Take a look at this please. Okay. Oh, that's right. I once saved a pretty girl just like you from bad guys. Oh, really? What was she like? Let's see... Let's talk about this later. Try to remember! Come on, brother! Brother? She says funny things. I'm not your brother. I'm Scorpion. - Yu! - Don't get him overexcited... You'd better rest. - Open your eyes! - What's this? Let me go! Stop it. Stop that! You opened my eyes! It's because of you! Thank you, brother! Yu, you helped me! I'm Scorpion! What is she? Let me go! Calm down or I'll call the police! Call them if you want! Call the stupid police! Get out! Scorpion's in trouble! Get out of here! Come with me! What? It's my turn to save you from this! Get up now, Yu! No! Get away! Get security! Open the door! It's my turn. What are you talking about? I was wrong! I thought I loved Miss Scorpion but I was wrong! I can tell you the truth now. You're not my brother, either! You're Yu! - Who's Yu? - You! Open the door! I'm Yu...? Yes, Yu. I'm your sister, Yoko. You put on the Scorpion costume and saved me from those guys. You saved me from the Zero Church too. You're my hero, you saved me twice! You're the man of my life. Try to remember. Look at me! Open up! Yoko... Yes, it's me, Yoko. I'm Yoko. Yu... Right. You're Yu. Yu, remember! I love you, Yu! From the bottom of my heart! Calm down. Everything' okay now. Calm down. It's okay. It's almost lunch time. Come to me. Introduce your Maria to me when you find her. Promise me. Don't use the Lord's name in vain! Forgive me for my sins. Maria. What's wrong? Nothing... Scorpion? Miss Scorpion? Scorpion! Wait, Scorpion! Scorpion! Stop the car! Stop the car now!
