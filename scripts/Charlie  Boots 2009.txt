MAN: (ON TV) There's been some gutsy selection. there's been some fantastic leadership throughout this game. I think he needs to take a hell of a lot of credit. There were moments throughout the series where Lydia was... (TV BROADCAST CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) (CATTLE LOW, BIRDS CHIRP) .. not just the one here today. He batted sensibly today. used his head. I don't know. Get Nigel to cover for me. He never does anything. I don't know. Uh, a week? I don't know.

Since when have you liked fishing? CHARLIE: I can open me own bloody door. BOOTS: Yeah, I know. Watch your fingers. BOOTS: Oh, for Christ's sake. Dad, are you coming? Just jump in the car. CHARLIE: I can bloody walk. BOOTS: Just get in the car. CHARLIE: What are we doing now? BOOTS: I'm just gonna grab a couple of things. I thought we were going fishing. We are, Dad.

It's the only good fishing around here. Yeah, we're, uh...not actually going fishing around here. What? Do you remember when I was little, you always promised me that one day we'd go and cast a line off the northernmost tip of Australia? No. Well, we're doing it. What do you mean? I mean we're doing it. We're on our way to Cape York. Have you lost your mind? (CHUCKLES) Yep. (TURNS ON RADIO) CHARLIE: Well, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of. Typical of you and your half-baked ideas. You're a dickhead. Cape York's, like, 3,000 miles from here. BOOTS: Yep, and it will be even further if you don't start studying that map. (UPBEAT ROCK SONG PLAYS ON RADIO) CHARLIE: Alright, then, where are we? Well, Warrnambool's about there. I bloody know that. Where are we going? - Well, we're about here. - Yeah. Cape York's all the way up there. Well, that's...that's just stupid. Yeah. It'll be fun. Don't you reckon? (UPBEAT SONG CONTINUES PLAYING) What the hell is that? Dad. Dad. Have a look at this little ripper. It's the Big Koala. (LAUGHS) Better have a look, eh? You coming? Uh, no, I can see it from here, son. Alright. I'm going to go inside. (CHUCKLES) BOOTS: "There was a young fella from Horsham "Who took out his balls to wash 'em "His wife said, "Jack, If you don't put them back "I'll jump on the buggers and squash 'em."' Remember telling me that? BOOTS: "In the heart of rich farming land and the Victorian goldfields, "Maryborough is famous for its railway station "and was settled in the 1830s." CHARLIE: You gonna be like this all the way? - BOOTS: What do you mean? - CHARLIE: Annoying. BOOTS: I just thought you might like me to, I don't know, read you some local colour. CHARLIE: Really? Why? BOOTS: Just because. Oh, well, don't worry about it, then. CHARLIE: OK. They're on their way to Warrnambool. Just telling them all the stuff they should see when they get there. Pity we won't be home. Could have shown them around. Well, maybe we should head back. (CHUCKLES) No, I'm serious. I'm, um, worried about the farm. Don't be. I spoke to Graeme. He said everything's fine. He said to have a good time. Yeah, well, at least your brother's responsible. Jeez, Dad, you got enough salt on those? I don't want me veins getting all floppy. I'm serious, Dad. You've got to start looking after yourself. Echuca's probably the go tonight, Dad, don't you reckon? You can have a look in the brochures up here if you want. Hey, fresh strawberries. WOMAN: Small punnets $3, large, $6, family size, 10 bucks. BOOTS: Family size? I think we might need one of them. Don't you think so, Dad? Huh? Actually, I think we'll get a couple of those. No worries. So which way are you headed? Uh, headed up north to Cape York, but we'll probably get to Echuca tonight. - Do you want anything else, Dad? - Nah. Well, enjoy. Yeah, will do. Thank you very much. Don't eat them all at once. BOOTS: (LAUGHS) We'll try not to. BOOTS: Eh? This is the life. The open road with my dad, fresh fruit. Does it get any better than this? What was that? That looks interesting. Must be glad you bought the family-sized punnet, eh? You could help. Nah, never fancied strawberries much. BOOTS: And she asked! She knew which way we were headed. And she said, "Don't eat them all at once." (GROANS) BOOTS: Paddle Wheel. That looks alright. Sing out, Dad, if you see one you like. The Georgian Motor Lodge. This looks like us. (WHISTLES) This is alright, isn't it? Here, pick a bed, Dad. I'm just going to go in the big action room. Bloody hell, Dad. There's a lot of mirrors in here. (CHUCKLES) Look at that. There's even one on the back of the door. Gee whiz! I could do with losing a few kilos, just quietly. (TOILET FLUSHES) Dad? Dad? Dad... Oh, shit. CHARLIE: Oi! Where you off to? You know, I honestly thought you'd left. On that bus. Yeah, well, I thought about it, but it was only the courtesy bus for the country club. And, of course, you never packed me clubs. Oh, did something die in here? Shouldn't have eaten all them strawberries. CHARLIE: Eugh. (SIGHS) (BOOTS SNORES) (BOOTS SNUFFLES) (BOOTS RESUMES SNORING) Good morning. Breakfast. "Sun, stars, steam and Murray River magic." - What's your problem? - PS 'Emmylou'. Paddle steamer. CHARLIE: Ah. Yeah, well, let me know how it goes. Come on, Dad. I thought we could go on it. CHARLIE: Paddle steamer - you get on it, it goes up the river, it turns around, comes back down again. What's the point? BOOTS: Why are you being so difficult? CHARLIE: I'm not being difficult. I'm saying that if you want to go on it, go on it. I just don't go in for that touristy stuff. - Oi! - (TYRES SCREECH) Hang on! It's a Holden museum! Kids, who can tell me the first Holden model made with a left-hand drive? The FB. MAN: Thank you, sir, but I was asking the kids. - Ah! Paddle steamer. - (STEAM WHISTLE HOOTS) Looks like fun. CHARLIE: Ah! New South Wales. Across the border. - BOOTS: Can you drive for a bit? - CHARLIE: No. BOOTS: Why do I have to do all the driving? CHARLIE: You don't have to. BOOTS: Alright, if I drive for the next two hours, then will you drive? - CHARLIE: No. - BOOTS: I'm still hungry. (WOMAN SHOUTS) MAN: Come on! (DOG BARKS) (SHEEP BLEAT) I don't mind sheep. Really? I didn't know that. Oh, yeah. Came up here once when I was a young'un. Worked for a month or two on a place called Frome Downs. We had cattle and sheep. Would've stayed longer if I could've. BOOTS: Why didn't you? CHARLIE: Oh, well, we had the family farm and, you know, I couldn't turn my back on that, you know? And I didn't want to let my father down. And, of course, I met your mum. BOOTS: "Hay. Population 2, 932. "Hay's in the Southern Riverina of New South Wales "in a semiarid grazing area known as the Hay Plains." You're not gonna stop this, are you? It's Australia, Dad.

We're OK. - CHARLIE: Could've been killed. - Killed! - Truck full of white leghorns. - Yep, we're OK, Dad. Tell her to get some driving lessons. Yeah, I will. Sorry. It's OK. You just kinda cut us off a little bit over there. Did l? Really? Tell her...tell her to get some glasses! You need glasses to see where you're going! BOOTS: Sorry. My dad, he's not himself at the moment. He's...a little bit... ..kinda hung up, that's all. Yeah, it's the shock from the accident. Dad, just shut up. Whole life rushed before me eyes. Ehh... It was pretty boring. What is it with you Victorians? MAN: Everything alright, Edna? Yeah. I can handle this. (TRUCK DRIVER TOOTS HORN) You're just lucky you're not a bloke. He'd have knocked your block off. For fuck's sake Dad, just shut up! Just... We should... We should keep moving, so, um... Yeah. I think perhaps you should keep moving. You should take that old man with you. Get some driving lessons off the nuns. Clown. (STARTS ENGINE) - Man, you're something else. - What? You should get some L-plates. Hang 'em round your neck. - What is wrong with you? - What? (SIGHS) (KOOKABURRA CACKLES) (KOOKABURRA CACKLES) Hello. Hi. (TALKBACK RADIO PLAYS SOFTLY) WOMAN: (ON RADIO) I have no doubt. I know he's very nervous. - (BOOTS YAWNS) - MAN: (ON RADIO) Thanks. Robin. You're with Ryan Miles on ABC local radio. After Prince Charles's embarrassing gaffe on the weekend. we're discussing your most embarrassing moments. Deirdre. you had a confession over wetting the... (TURNS OFF ENGINE) Just filling up, Dad. Get me a sarsaparilla, will you, Boots? Yeah. RYAN MILES: (ON RADIO, LAUGHS) Oh. Deirdre. that's terrible. But I must say you were brilliant blaming it on the cat. DEIRDRE: I know. The poor thing. RYAN: Well. next we have a Charlie on the line. CHARLIE: (ON RADIO) Yeah. g'day. Yeah. this one's about my son. Let's call him...Slippers. Yep. Now. one day when he was about 14. I come in early from the milkin'. I opened the door and... (LAUGHS).. there he was. Yeah. buffin' the bazooka. RYAN: I'm sorry? Chokin' the goose. RYAN: Oh. well. um... thanks for that. Charlie. CHARLIE: Hammering the hamster. some might say. RYAN: Yes...yes. thanks. Charlie. I think we've got it. CHARLIE: Oh. you couldn't miss it. The kid's hung like a draught horse. RYAN: (AWKWARDLY) Thank you. CHARLIE: Well, this is interesting. I'm not talking to you. "The yellow-rumped pardalote, a rare bird indeed, "can occasionally be spotted foraging in this area." (YELLS) Pig! What? That was a bit rough. - I was just... - Pig! BOOTS: Arggh! (BOOTS CURSES AND YELLS) CHARLIE: Ahh, brake! Jesus! CHARLIE: Oh! Whoa. (RATTLING) Thanks for stopping. I've been out here for ages. Thought I was gonna be out there all night. BOOTS: No worries. Where are you headed? To, uh, Cape York. To go fishing. Is that anywhere near Tamworth? Well, Tamworth's on the way. Cape York's on the very northern tip of Australia. Oh, cool. (STARTS ENGINE) CHARLIE: So, how did you end up out here? My boyfriend was taking me to Tamworth. I'm a singer. And he cracked it and kicked me out. He's a real arsehole. Why did he do that? Um, he wanted me to do things to him I didn't want to. And I told him so. And he begged, and I said no, and he begged some more and then he kicked me out. (CHUCKLES) Yep, sounds like an arsehole to me. So, how far's this Cape York? It's about 2,500 k's. When I was young, Dad promised we'd do it one day so we're doing it now. That's so great. I'm Jess. I'm Charlie. And this is Boots. How you goin'? Charlie and Boots. CHARLIE: Pretty cool, eh? (LAUGHS) Oh, well, he's out. He's so cute. (CHUCKLES) I suppose. Do you love him? Well, yeah, he's my dad. I mean, we've had our ups and downs but, uh... ..I don't know, he's kind of all I've got now. Well, there's my brother, but... Your mum? No, she...she died last month. JESS: That must be awful. I don't know what I'd do if my mum died. I never got to meet my dad. JESS: You're not married? BOOTS: Oh, I was. Mum and Dad were married for 45 years. He must miss her. Yeah. Here I am, I couldn't even manage to stay married for three years. What happened? Uh...Therese, my wife... I don't know, I guess I was just never really what she needed. She was a city girl. Mum and Dad tried to get her involved in the farm but I told them to pull their head in and... ..and...with what happened... ..uh... Did you have any kids? Yeah, a little boy. Ben. You know, I reckon you'll find someone else. Yeah, I'm not really... JESS: So you live on the farm with your dad? BOOTS: No, my little brother runs it now. Me and my wife moved away, so... Can you not go back? No. I mean, I love the farm, don't get me wrong. But I don't know, things just didn't work out that way, I guess. Plus, it wouldn't really be fair, I suppose, on my brother. Which I know disappoints my dad. JESS: Why are you called Boots? BOOTS: My mum was a real character. I mean, what you might call a free spirit. You know, she was into the arts and music, and one day in a moment of inspiration she decided to name me after her favourite singer. Dad never really was crazy about the name so he's always called me Boots. Who was the singer? (CHUCKLES) - Dean Martin? - I wish. (CHUCKLES) Frank Sinatra? (LAUGHS) Fred Astaire? - No, he was a dancer. - Oh. (GIGGLES) Um... I'm not gonna tell you. Sorry about that one, son. Another argument I lost with your mother. (LAUGHS) He's awake. - Morning, Charlie. - Morning. BOOTS: It's starting to get a little bit late. Maybe we should stop over in Gilgandra. OK, well, maybe you can drop me at a service station, then? We can take you the rest of the way in the morning. - I really can't afford to pay... - No, don't worry about that. Me and Dad can get you a room, can't we, Dad? Oh, sure. Not gonna just drop you alongside the roadway. Thank you. (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS) (SINGS) # Giddy-up! # She's a wild horse and I wanna ride # She's a full moon on a restless night... # Wow.

Situated in the gently rolling hills of northern New South Wales.

I don't know. Nothing, really. - What was her problem? - Dad! Well, you did everything you could do and... Yeah, well, when something happens like... ..you know, what did happen, I don't know, people just react differently, I guess. Yeah, well, it's for better or for worse, you know? You can't just then go off running around with... Dad, that's not fair. You weren't there. You wouldn't let us be. She wants to get back together. What? Do you want to? Nah. How do you go back? Would you like to? Nah, I can't. You were so lucky to have Mum. Yeah, well, nothing's perfect. - What? - Every marriage has its problems. Are you saying you and Mum did? Do you remember Gavin O'Connor? The school principal? Yeah. Yeah, well, when you was a kid, your mum was sort of acting suspiciously, staying out late at night and always going to meetings and... Hmm. Anyway, one night, I followed her. And she went to Gavin's place. What? Just about killed me. Did you confront them? Nah. I was too scared of losing her. I never told anyone that. Not long after that, Gavin moved to Sydney and... Nah, she loved you, Dad. I mean, she...she adored you. Yeah, I know. I know. You kids were like that. CHARLIE: Especially you. You were a little bugger. You had to be everywhere first. You were always 10m out in front of us, running and skipping and tripping over things. CHARLIE: (LAUGHS) Oh, you were a funny little bugger. CHARLIE: You OK, mate? I'm gonna go for a walk. CHARLIE: You think you'll ever have more kids? BOOTS: Yeah. I think so. CHARLIE: You should, you know. You can either let what happened... ..beat you... ..or you can try and overcome it. Hmm. Yeah. You shouldn't wait too long. Time waits for no man... ..and very few women. Yeah, well, obviously I've gotta meet someone first. - Hmm? - Yeah. That shouldn't be too hard. Sleep tight. See you in the morning, son. BOOTS: Yeah. Goodnight, Dad. - What are you up to? - What? I don't know. You're up to something. Oh! I'm just having me breakfast. Yeah, right. Oh, excuse me, love. My son here, Boots, was just asking me if I thought you were married or not and I said to him, "Go ahead. Ask her yourself." Yes, I am. Sorry. Oh, told you. Aww! You'll find someone. Yeah, thanks. - (THUD!) - Oooh, what? What? What? Oh. Oh, excuse me, love. Yes? My son Boots here, that strapping young fellow over there... - Oh, what's your pleasure, love? - Oh, just one of those. There you go. Thanks, darl. Oh, all part of the service. - Here's your change. - Thanks. And, um, this is our card. It's got the phone number on it, in case you need it. Thanks. BOOTS: Look, Dad, all I'm saying is I don't need help with the ladies. Well, we both know that's a load of rubbish. Alright, well, put it this way - I certainly don't need your help with the ladies. Hey, she gave you her phone number, didn't she? Yeah, but I didn't ask for it. That's what I'm for. No, Dad, that's not what you're here for. From now on, stay in the car when we stop to eat. (UNIMPRESSED) Oh! So, it turns out I'm good with the ladies. Who knew? Eugh. You alright, Dad? Just get past this truck, son. (TRUCK HORN TOOTS) (HORN CONTINUES TOOTING) - Dad? - CHARLIE: (WHISPERS) Boots. WOMAN: G'day, Wes, boys. Dad? Boots, here. What the...? Quick. - G'day, mate. - G'day. Where will I find that great hunk of spunk you were with? My dad? Your dad? Yeah, must be. My dad? Now, let me think. I mean, he couldn't be far away. I mean, he was here, like, a minute ago. My dad? Hmm... Oh, hang on. Oh, here it is. Found her. The cup we... Oh, hello, love. (BOOTS AND CHARLIE LAUGH) You're good with the ladies? Well, you know, I'm a dairy farmer but that was absurd. (BOTH LAUGH) BOOTS: You should have seen you, trying to bend in there like a koala bear trying to get in a matchbox. CHARLIE: Good thinking, though, wasn't it? BOOTS: A foam cup, eh? She wouldn't have got hers in a foam cup. (BOTH LAUGH) - There you go, fellas. - Oh, thanks, love. Where are you heading? We're thinking about going this way up to Emerald and then all the way up to the Cape. Oh, no worries. Most people take the Roma road but my hubby, Clive - he's a sales rep - swears by the road straight north and then you cut across at a place they call Mongans Lane. That's about 100 k's north of here. Then get on to the Emerald road from there. He reckons it saves about an hour and a half. Sounds good to me. You know what they say about local knowledge! It's a good road? Yeah. Yeah. A bit of gravel, about 40 k's, but no traffic. No worries. Thanks for that. Beautiful country out this way, isn't it? Yeah. Which was the road she said to take? Actually, I think this is it coming up here, isn't it? Mongans Lane. This is it here. BOOTS: Wow! Look at that. The sky looks amazing. BOOTS: Bugger. BOOTS: It's not too bad. It's just a burst radiator hose. CHARLIE: Can you fix it? No. I haven't got any tools. CHARLIE: What do you expect? You set off on some harebrained bloody trip, half-cocked. I haven't got a spare radiator hose either. CHARLIE: You're a bloody dickhead. You knew we were coming up here. You should have brought a spare. BOOTS: Well, it wasn't exactly a trip that I'd planned, Dad. CHARLIE: Oh, bloody useless. What sort of an idiot comes up here without his tools? Me, Dad. Me. Is that what you want to hear? I mean, I'm not Graeme. I mean, I'm doing my best here, Dad, but I can't do everything. I don't know what you want. I want your mum back. Well, I can't do anything about that, Dad. I mean, the same as I couldn't do anything about Ben. I want to go home. BOOTS: To do what, Dad? What? Sit in the dark and feel sorry for yourself? Fuck, Dad! It wouldn't hurt to cry, you know? But you just cut yourself off. You did it... I mean, you did it when Ben died and you're doing it now. You went on and on to me with all this bullshit about, you know, "Don't let it destroy you." And what are you doing? You know, Dad, let's not pretend that I don't know about loss. Really! Dad, my heart nearly stopped when Ben drowned and I have struggled every day... I've got to tell you the truth - it is not a day that goes by that l... I mean, Mum was there when he died. I mean, how did that happen? I mean, she was looking after him. I mean, they were playing hide-and-seek, for God's sake. Your mum struggled with that every bloody day since. I'd go to sleep at night and wake up to her crying her eyes out. I would have liked to cry with her too but someone has to say "Don't worry, love" and "You'll feel better tomorrow" and "It's God's will" and whatever other pathetic bullshit I could come out with. You know Therese, I mean, never forgave Mum for that? And I got to be honest, Dad - I wrestled with it too. And you know what really gets me, is that, I mean, despite all that, I never got to tell Mum I still loved her. CHARLIE: Oh, mate, she knew that. I promise you, she knew. BOOTS: (MUTTERS) I need to cry. CHARLIE: I'll never forget the night I first met your mum. It was the footy club dance at the Allansford Hall. Oh, she was something. Took my breath away. She was the new school teacher in town then and every bloke in town was after her. I remember Gary Flood, Archie Witherspoon, Joey Twigg... (CHUCKLES)..in fact, the whole bloody football team was lined up waiting to get a dance with her. I thought to myself, "lf I don't make a move now, I'm gonna miss out." As luck happened, I spotted a gap in the pack, sidestepped my way through and asked her for a dance. And she said yes. Then the music started and it was the bloody tangoette. Tangoette? CHARLIE: The dance of love. Oh, tough one. Oh. (SIGHS) Anyway, the next thing, there I was, gliding across the dance floor, cheek to cheek with your mum, Gracie. I was a pretty useful footy player. You know, quick on me feet. But I couldn't dance for shit. (BOOTS CHUCKLES) I was treading all over her feet and kicking her shins and... (SIGHS) Disaster. So what did you do? I did the only thing I could do, the only decent thing to do - I faked a hammy. (GROANS) (LAUGHS) Fantastic. Yeah, it worked. Your mum helped me off the dance floor... ..and then spent the next 45 years looking after me. Oh, God, I miss her. I miss her. Yeah, I know. (DOG PANTS) MAN: You blokes got some trouble, have ya? Oh, yeah. We've done our radiator hose. And where are you fellas off to anyway, eh? CHARLIE: We're heading up the Cape. I promised me son here I'd take him fishing at the northernmost tip of Australia. MAN: You blokes right? Yeah, let her rip. Got another rope? Oh, no. No worries, then. I'll just double this one up, eh? Sure. Thanks. Alright. That should do it. I was thinking, maybe just take it a little bit easier this time. MAN: Yeah, righto. Bloody hell. It's hard to see. Oh, well, you don't need me, mate. I'll have a little nap. Bullshit! We're doing 80! Maybe they've forgot we're back here. Shit, Dad, we're doing 100! Didn't that waitress say that her old man did 120 on this road? But I bet he wasn't bloody towing someone. BOOTS: This guy's trying to kill us. - Whoa! Shit! - (TYRES SCREECH) Shit! We're doing 120 already. (SIREN WAILS) CHARLIE: Uh-oh. I want you to pull over. You want us to what? I want you to pull over. Pull over? This should be interesting. You, uh...you might want to talk to the guys in the other car. Don't worry about them. I'll deal with them in a minute. (LAUGHS) He's a bright bugger. You know you're being towed? Oh? Oh, really? And here we were, just about to try and overtake the buggers. Stay here. Stay here? (LAUGHS) BOOTS: Uh, roger. (SNORTS WITH LAUGHTER) MAN: There you go, fellas. Yeah, uh, sorry about the speeding ticket back there, eh? Ah, no worries. Still can't believe he tried to book us for tailgating. What's going on? What's goin' on?! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (COMMENTATOR SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) (CHEERING) (PEOPLE SCREAM) - (FIRECRACKER POPS) - Go on! Get out of it! (MAN ON P.A. SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) BOOTS: Oh! (CHUCKLES) Bloody hell. Did you see that? You'd have to be half mad, wouldn't you? Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, coming up straight after this event - the inaugural amateur challenge. Which one of you would-be cowboys out there in the crowd wants to get on the legendary buckin' bull, the mighty Dynamite? Come up and put your names down. We're gonna draw it in about 10 minutes time. All you would-be cowboys... (CHEERING) I need a leak. Yeah, alright. I'll stay here. You took your time. MAN: (ON P.A.) Right now it's time to draw the name of the very brave man who, shortly, will be precariously perched upon over one tonne of angry fillet steak on our feature bull named Dynamite. What's that? What's that? Well. it seems that it's going to be easier than I thought. There's only one man - shall I say. with the kahunas - game enough to mix it with the big boys. Give him a round of applause, ladies and gentlemen. How about it? About to ride Dynamite - Boots McFarland. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) I'm fucking what? MAN: (ON P.A.) Come on up here. Boots. What is wrong with you? Boots McFarland, ladies and gentlemen! My son! Give him a big hand. Mate, no worries - I had a good look at that old bull. It's as gentle as a lamb. Are you mad? There's no way I'm gonna be able to ride a bull. Mate, you think I don't know cattle after all these years? If he's a bucking bull, I'm the next pope. Wave to the fans. MAN: You're gonna die, you fat f... Whoa! Thank God you're here, mate. Thought we were gonna have to cancel the event. Huh, great. You've obviously done this before. - No. - Really? Well, this bloke hasn't bucked this century. The only thing you're in danger of is this old boy falling asleep and laying down. Yeah. Now, when he gets out, he'll just trundle around a bit, alright? Huh. Try and make it look dangerous and jump off when you're ready. Just bend that round the back again. (BULL BRAYS LOWLY) I've ridden a horse before. Does that help? Oh, well... (CHUCKLES) ..we'll be right, then, won't be? Enjoy. You ready? BOOTS: Yeah. Our cowboy, Boots McFarland, is raring to go. Hey, Boots, give us a wave. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) MAN: (ON P.A.) Now. Boots. for climbing aboard. you are already our winner. We've got a dinner for two at the Los Elmos Emerald Mexican Cantina. And also - this might help dull the pain - a dozen bottles of lnner Circle rum. - (BULL GRUNTS) - MAN: Shit! (CROWD CHEERS) Oh, shit! (BOOTS GRUNTS) Oh! Get away from... Get aw... (MEN SHOUT INDISTINCTLY) BOOTS: Oh! Oh, hey! No, no, no, no, no! Hey! Come on. Get out of here. Go, go, go! (BRAYS) Run! Go, go, go, go, go, go! (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) Well, what do you say now, your holiness? (CHUCKLES) (CHARLIE GRUNTS) Huh! (LAUGHS) (PEOPLE SCREAM) - What'd I tell ya? Piece of cake. - (SCOFFS) "Piece of cake." - I know me cattle, mate. - He was a big piece of cake. Oh, how you doin'? - This here is... - Boots. - Oh, Leilani. - Beautiful day. Hello. Single. What'd I tell you, mate? All the girls love a cowboy. Oh, yeah, Dad. I'm a cowboy. I'm a hurt one. That was part of me plan. - Yeah, you had a... - Hello. You boys like a massage? Oh, yeah, Boots here would. Yeah. Actually, we both would. - No, mate, l... - Yeah, come on. CHARLIE: I've... I've never had a massage. Mate, no! If you could just put these on. On what? (CHUCKLES) Yeah, sure. Thanks. Which is the front and which is the back? I think it kind of depends on what kind of look you're going for. (BOTH LAUGH) Are you ready, boys? Oh. (LAID-BACK MUSIC PLAYS) (BOOTS CHUCKLES AND GRUNTS) Uh... (GRUNTS) Love, while I don't doubt that you could change a tractor tyre with your bare hands... - You reckon? - Yeah. ..just bear in mind that you're working on a vintage Rolls-Royce here. Okey-dokey. (CHUCKLES) Whoops! Not too high, love. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Don't wanna damage the gearbox. Oh. (BOOTS GRUNTS) - Dad, Dad. - Yeah. I dare you to ask for the "executive finish'. Fuck off! (LAUGHS) Oh-ho! (UPBEAT MEXICAN MUSIC PLAYS) How are you feeling? Bit sore, mate. How about you? (CHUCKLES) Sore. If I'd had come down off that bull any harder I'd have three Adam's apples. (BROAD AUSTRALIAN ACCENT) Buenas noches, amigos. Sorry? Oh, it means, "Good evening, friends, " in Mexico. My dad makes me say it. He says it makes the place more authentic. BOOTS AND CHARLIE: Authentic. Of course, the moustache is real, right? No. He makes me wear that too. - Oh. (CHUCKLES) - Get out! Well, uh, amigo, we are mucho hungry. Righto, then. Well, mucho gracias and adios, amigos. Oh, hooroo, amigo. (CHUCKLES) See ya, mate. - CHARLIE: Very authentic. - BOOTS: Yeah, got me convinced. CHARLIE: (BURPS) Ooh. What do you reckon's in a burrito? BOOTS: I don't know, but it's in us now. (CHUCKLES) Well, bugger me. It's that Tristan's car. You're kidding. No. What are you doing? - Gonna hide it. - That is so immature. Not to mention childish. - Gonna help? - (SCOFFS) Yeah. OK, steady. - Just make sure the handbrake's on. - Yeah, yeah. (GRUNTS) You've never grown up, have ya? Bit late now. (LAUGHS) - Shh, shh, shh! - Gonna hide it behind that truck. - Where you going? - Over there. CHARLIE: Oh, ohh! Uh-oh! BOOTS: Oh, not good. Not good, not good, not good. That can't be good. Uh, no. CHARLIE: Didn't his car have four spotlights on it? Uh, yeah. (METAL CRUNCHES, ALARM BLARES) CHARLIE: So one day God was sitting around in Heaven on his La-Z-Boy recliner. Well, he can if he wants to - he's God. And he saw his son come in and he said, "Jesus, lad, over here." He said, "I've been looking down at Earth "and it's a terrible mess. "I'm gonna have to send you down there to straighten them out." And Jesus said, "My pleasure, Dad." "There's a bit of a drawback, though, " he said. "I'm gonna have to send you as a human being. "You'll be mortal "and I'm afraid you're gonna have to die for their sins." Jesus says, "Ohhh, you know, OK, your wish is my command, " etc. He said, "Look, son, the best thing I can do, though, "is I can give you a choice in how you're gonna die. "You can either be crucified "or you can be stung to death by killer bees." (CHUCKLES) And that's the reason that all over the world today, Christians make the sign of the cross. And not... (LAUGHS) (CHARLIE CRIES OUT COMICALLY) BOOTS: Alright, another one. - There's two nuns, they're in a car. - Oh, no! Yeah, they're in a car and this massive bat comes in and it's kind of like Satan. And it lands on the bonnet, foaming blood and fierce, kind of going, "Arggh!" On the bonnet - "Rarr!" On the bonnet, right? And one of the nuns says, "Quick, Maud, show him your cross." And she goes, "Oh, good idea, " and she winds the window down and goes, "Get off the bonnet, you..." BOOTS: (SINGSONGS): "There was a young man from McLeod "Who was caressing a girl in the crowd "When someone down front said..." - No, no, no, no. - No what? That's the wrong limerick, son. You've got two mixed up. It goes like this. "There was a young girl from Bude "Who got on a tram in the nude "When the vicar down front..." A vicar? Rubbish, vicar! That's not a limerick. It has to rhyme with 'McLeod' 'cause the last line of the limerick is "Just like that, out loud." No. How can that be a limerick? A limerick has to have a certain rhythm, a count to it. It goes, "Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da..." Da-da-da! Bullshit! That's not a limerick. Mine's a limerick. Yours is not a limerick. It's not. A limerick's supposed to be funny. Mine's hilarious. Yours isn't. CHARLIE: Limericks are an art form, an ancient art form from Ireland, OK? And I taught ya! Can I help you, boys? Yes, you can, love, as a matter of fact. You look to me like a woman of the world. "There was a young lady from Bude..." - Let it go! - "Who got on a tram in the nude..." No, "There was a young man from McLeod "Who was caressing a girl in the crowd..." No, that's a joke, not a limerick. - It is a limerick, Dad. - No. It's the "Girl in the nude." - And it's not a vicar. - It's always a vicar. - It's never a vicar. - Vicars are funny. - They ride round on bikes... - Look... - On bikes? You are off your trolley. - Look! - What's it got to do with a bike? - Look, I'm not interested. It sounds disgusting. You're both old enough to know better, especially you. Now, if you want to order food, go ahead. Otherwise, you can leave. MAN: Where are you blokes headin'? Up to Cape York. We're going fishing off the tip of Australia. Not in this, you're not. Especially this time of the year. This won't even go close. Oh? Oh, well, um... ..have to get a hold of a four-wheel drive. - Eh, Dad? - Yeah. Yeah, we can rent one. Anywhere near here we can get one of those? Yep. Down at Cairns. No worries. Well, there you go. But unless it's got fins, I don't think it'll help ya. What do you mean? It's the wet season. River crossings are 30ft deep this time of the year. Then there's the crocs. Bloody wet season. Mate, we did bloody well to get this far. We can still whip over to Port Douglas. I reckon the fishing there's great. Eh? Yeah, I know, Dad, but... ..you know, just once in my life it'd be nice to actually achieve something I've set out to do. You know what I mean? Does that thing work? (FLY BUZZES) I'm not going up in that. Oh, yes, you are. You've already dragged me We're going through with this now. Does it even fly? Well, it did last time we dragged it out. Sorta. (DOOR CREAKS) I've gotta tell you, I'm not too crazy about flying. Especially in small planes. MAN: If you get scared, just close your eyes. That's what I do. Oh, fantastic. Well, you could always stay here. Look after the servo with Marge. BOOTS: Nup. Your missus scares me. MAN: Yeah, that makes two of us. CHARLIE: Hey, where do you get your aviation fuel around here? Aviation fuel? That's just revenue raising for the government. I use what I've got in the pumps. That works just as well? Yeah. Well, seems to. MAN: That'll do it. Climb on in. (SIGHS) I'm glad you blokes turned up. I've been looking for an excuse to see if the old girl will still get off the ground with a big load like this. (SIGHS) (ENGINE PURRS) Mate, you know, I'm really glad you talked me into this trip. (GRUNTS) CHARLIE: Here's the captain. Yeah, well... Well, she's started. That's always a good sign. All tied in? - Yep. - Sort of. OK. PILOT: Ah, shit! BOOTS: Are they cows up there on the runway? PILOT: Not mine, the neighbours'. I keep forgetting to fix that bloody fence. CHARLIE: They look like Brahmas. Good stock. BOOTS: Shouldn't we be pulling up? Can we pull up, pull up?! - (COWS BELLOW) - BOOTS AND CHARLIE: Oh, shit! That was a bit of fun. PILOT: Look at that, fellas. Atherton Tablelands. Home of agriculture, bananas, pineapples... Oh, fuck me! Not you too. He's bad enough. CHARLIE: You get her up very often? PILOT: Nah. Haven't been flying much lately. Due to the fact that the carby's a bit dodgy. How long's this gonna take? Oh, dunno. Two...three hours. Hope you had a pee before we left. You do know how to find it, yeah? I've flown to Cape York dozens of times. Never as the pilot, though. Now, the ocean's meant to be on our left or our right? Right! Oh, well. No worries, then. Mate, this thing, can you do aerobatics in this? No, it's not built for it. I went up with a crop-duster pilot once. And he done one of those stall drops. Geez, it was fun. I can do a stall. Easy. Thing is not to panic just because the ground's coming up at 200 miles an hour. See that, Boots? That's the beautiful Daintree forest. Amazing, isn't it? Just gently... pull it back. Oh, that was fun. PILOT: Do you want to have a try? CHARLIE: (ENTHUSIASTICALLY) Oh, me? Ohh. Uh, I'd better not. PILOT: Look at that. Great Barrier Reef. One of the true wonders of the world. PILOT: It really is something, isn't it? Wow. I hope that's broken. See that? You can see both coastlines. We've almost run out of Australia. PILOT: There she is. CHARLIE: So, that's Cape York, eh? - Where's the airstrip? - Airstrip? I'll chuck her down on the beach. - BOOTS: Does that work? - PILOT: No worries. As my old mate Bill used to say, "Any landing you can walk away from's a good landing." PILOT: God rest his soul. (LAUGHS) - PILOT: You got everything? - BOOTS: Yeah, that's the lot, mate. - Can't thank you enough, Roly. - No worries. Yeah, thanks, mate. - I'll be back in a few days. - Sounds good. Well, better get goin' before the sun disappears. I hope I can find me way back. (CHUCKLES) ("CATCH THE WIND' BY DONOVAN PLAYS) - There you go, son. - Thanks. Oh. Sarsaparilla! (CHUCKLES) Ahhh. I... I've been thinkin' about buying old Tommy Noonan's farm. Of course l'd... ..I'd need someone to help me run it. Photo. For the fridge. Ripper. "There was a young man from Bombay..." "Who caught a slow boat to China one day..." "He was tied to the tiller..." "By a sex-crazed gorilla..." BOTH: "And China's a long way away." - (CHUCKLES) - Here we go.
