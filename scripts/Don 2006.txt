Put your hands up. No... Put them up. Relax sweetheart! l said 'No' because TJ... ...forgot to say 'Please'. Please.... put your hands up. You think you're very smart. But not this time. This time l keep the case for free. And because l know that you will want to avenge this day... ...you'll haVe to die. TJ! Do you know that there are 36 points on the human body... ...if struck right ...could prove fatal. ls that so? lts just that l'm in a dilemma now. About what? About who, between the two of you... ...l should l kill first! l always liked you Don. Me too, TJ. l've also always... ...liked me. Don't shoot don't shoot... lf you kill me... ...my men won't let you live long. You will get caught. No, TJ. Not only is it difficult to catch Don... lt's lmpossible! l want to thank you... ...for your help on behalf of our government. We know the gang we're looking for... ...has made Kuala Lumpur its base. Our Chief lnvestigating Officer Mr.De Silva will give you all the details. Sir... Thank you Verma. Gentlemen l'll come to the point. Firstly, let me tell you all we know about this gang. Verma... When the Soviet Union split up in 1 990, a number of small nations were born. Selling arms to terrorists and fundamentalist groups... ...became a lucrative business for a few people in these countries. One of the new empires built with this money was headed by a man named Boris. Verma... When these empires crumbled under international pressure... ...Boris disappeared. And when he wasn't found after years of searching... ...he was presumed dead. But Boris was not dead. He had gone to lndia. He inVested the money he made selling arms into drugs. He bought drugs in bulk from Afghanistan, Pakistan and lndia.... ...and started distributing them in Europe. His two invaluable lieutenants in this business... ...Vardhaan and Singhania. We don't have a single photograph of Vardhaan. Nor do we know who or where he is. Reason? This is Singhania. lt is rumoured that Boris wanted to hand over the business to Vardhaan... ... but Singhania murdered Boris. Did he kill Vardhaan too? Perhaps he did... Because there's been no trace of Vardhaan since then. And this is Don. ...who manages Singhania's business here. Given the information we have, it is clear... The most dangerous and cunning criminal among them all... ...is this man. Good shot. Yeah, Narang. Hello Anita. Mr. Singhania had called. He wanted to know how the police knows so much... ...about our operation. lt's hard to say. All our men are very loyal. ls that so? What madness is this, Don?! Narang.. this is a good shot. Did you see Kumar's feet? Terrible shoes! l didn't like his shoes! Ramesh... This loyal man of yours was actually a police informer. The next time before you recruit anyone.... ... please get him to meet me once. Or check his shoes, at least. Kumar. l don't understand. How did they find out he was our informer! Good question! You... Vishal Malik.l'm with the lnterpol. l see. l am... - DCP De Silva. l know. And now l'd like to know how a fact that only top lndian officers knew... ...came to Don's knowledge? l don't know. By the way... Who told you? Excuse us. l'm sorry, Mr. De Silva. l wasn't pointing a finger at you. Then who? lnspector Verma. See... he is young. Recently inducted into the force. Newly married. lts quite possible... Mr. Malik. l wonder if you're actually drinking coffee? Just checking. l trust lnspector Verma. Anything else? Yes.l too am involved in this investigation from now. Hi Kamini. That's great news. Where are the two of you? That was quick. l am so happy, Kamini. lf my brother wants a better life today, it's all because of you. Thank you. Anyways, our hero is in a pretty bad mood. Why? Hi Roma. l know a lot about them. lf Don even suspects that l am leaving him.. ...he'll kill me. Ramesh... By the time Don finds out we'll be long gone. Anyway, l am gonna see you at the airport tonight, okay? l know that after Mom and Dad died... ...whatever you did was, to an extent, for my happiness. But l wasn't happy... ...nor did l feel that what you were doing was right. ...until today. l am proud of you. Yes, Narang. Poor... Ramesh. Ramesh... Very sad... Very sad. l always thought of you as reliable. But unfortunately, you didn't think the same of me. All you had to do was tell me you wanted out... ...and l'd have arranged it all for you. Don! l... Don, l... Yes.. what? l made a mistake. Why are you saying that? Your love for that girl... What's her name? Kamini. Kamini! Your love for Kamini isn't a mistake? Anyway... l am here to say goodbye. Ramesh... Have a nice life. Yeah. One dirty fish can make the entire pond dirty. But if that pond... ...is to become mine. lt becomes necessary to kill it. Ramesh... People don't leave Don. They leave this world. Kamini, l need to ask you a few questions. What do you want to know? Ramesh was always with Don. ls that true? Yes. Do you remember any particular place that Ramesh used to go often? Yes. Tell me. This information can help me to catch Don. lt's not my desire to get him caught, Officer. Kamini, don't do anything that... ...could put your life at risk. l don't care whether l live or die now. But the police department cares. l'm trying to quit... lt kills you. This camera...this pistol... Why do you need all this security? Because a "Do Not Disturb" sign doesn't work in this hotel. What are you thinking? l'm thinking that... ...l don't like two types of girls. One, who take too long to succumb to me. The second, who succumb too quickly. And l succumbed too quickly. What did you say your name was? Sonia. Sonia, the time between us meeting and you being in this hotel room... ...is just half an hour. That's because, when l saw you l felt... ... it was you l've been searching for. Romantic talk bores me, Sonia! Shall l get it? No.. lt's mine. Why don't you go inside... ...and get into something more... ...comfortable. Sure! Yes.. Anita. Kamini... Thank God you're okay. Where are you? There isn't anything else to wear. l know. Who were you talking to? l'm sorry? Oh that! To my Aunt. She worries needlessly, if l'm slightly late. l can't tell her the truth, can l... ... about where l am... ...and who l'm with. Bring your Aunt along next time. She's not your type, Don. Oh.. yes. Why the hurry? Why else would l want to be here? This heart of mine is crazy for my love. His love is like a flame burning in my heart l am willing to let this flame engulf me You can't escape from it's intensity either This heart of mine is crazy for my love. This heart of mine is crazy for my love. My heart always gets what it craves for But my love can take my life if my lover requests it My heart always gets what it craves for But my love can take my life if my lover requests it l gift you my life in return for yours. This heart of mine is crazy for my love. His love is like a flame burning in my heart Every moment that passes, A storm rages in my heart. As the goal l desire is coming closer. Every moment that passes, A storm rages in my heart. As the goal l desire is coming closer. You will never forget the day our hearts collided This heart of mine is crazy for my love. His love is like a flame burning in my heart l am willing to let this flame engulf me You can't escape from it's intensity either This heart of mine is crazy for my love. This heart of mine is crazy for my love. Your Aunt is outside, along with a bunch of uncles! May l know the reason for this family reunion? Ramesh was my fiance. He had never mentioned you. l can understand why. lt's been a pleasure meeting you. The pistol is empty. You're right! Let's go. The police are waiting for you. The police of many countries are waiting for me. But... Sonia... Not only is it difficult to catch Don... lt's lmpossible! Really... You know what! You know this pistol is empty. l know the pistol is empty but... The police don't know the pistol is empty. And wait for my call, is that understood. Sir... Verma... Hold it right there. Surprise... surprise... Officers, please. Put your guns down. Or else.. lt would be wise to surrender, Don! l don't think so. lt'd be wiser for you to move back. l'm asking for the last time. Or l'll be forced to... Stop. Okay... Down... Good. Come nice and easy everyone down... ...and move back. A little more. l just want to get out of here. lf you help me, this girl... ...will be grateful to you all her life. Thank you. Good night... Gentemen. Listen to me... Don. First, call the lift. For the lady. Go on. Quickly. Don, l'm unarmed. l can't stop you even if l want to. Let the girl go. Of course l will. Once l get out of here. Trust me. No... Damn it... Verma... What's going on! Who are you? Questions later. l have to get out of here first. Put the pistol down. You have no idea who l am? Mr. Narang, Police... Move... Stop that car. Put your hands up. And step out of the car. Out.. of the car! Wait, Vikram!... Let's go. Go. Who is this girl? Roma. She can be useful to us. Or is she useful? lf you had seen her shoot two cops a while ago... ...you wouldn't be asking that. Really... Yes, Vikram.. l'll be there right away. Come, Roma. Go ahead Narang. l'm in no danger from this girl. So, the police is after you. Why? l'm charged with murder. But as usual, the truth is somewhat different, right! Wrong. The charge is true. What was his name? RajiV. He was my sister's husband. Your sister must have felt terrible. My sister is dead. He killed her. So you killed him.Good! What do you want from me? Nothing. Narang saheb said... Oh, Narang... Come closer. Come on. You know, what l think... l think... l think Narang wants to start a new sort of 'trade' which... Very good. l like wild cats a lot. Wild.. cats... What happened? What did you think? She tried to kill me. Relax.. Narang. You will work with us from today. Thank you Don. Jairaj called from lndia. He wants more cocaine. l know. Did you speak to Jairaj? Yes... l didn't say anything to him. but... ...you are asking for more money than Mr. Singhania had said. This deal will bring us profits in millions. Don't you like such a huge sum? lt's not that but it's not your job to make this decision... ...it's Mr. Singhania's! Singhania makes the decision. l do the work. So what do you do? l don't talk like a child. Such arrogance isn't good. Don't forget, this business was set up by him. Then tell him to come here and manage it. What's this? Your wedding DVD! This disc has information of all our business and contacts. The next time Mr. Singhania is here, you can give it to him! Don, l'm not saying your intentions are wrong. All l'm saying is... ...you're moving very fast. For what l want to achieve... ...this speed is essential! But turning your friends into enemies for this quest... ...would be a big mistake. The biggest mistake, Don's enemy can make... ...is to make an enemy of Don! You have forgotten what happened yesterday. lf l ever find out that your memory has returned... Then remember this too... The bullets will be real next time. Yes.. Verma. l just got information that Don is going to lndia. When? Day after tomorrow. For a deal with someone named Jairaj. We'll leave tonight. And find out where we can find Jairaj. Deepak, come here. lt's not nice seeing you empty-handed, Jairaj. Where's the money? ln the car. Hand over the case to me. Nobody says please anymore. As you like... Here you go! Sir, he's driving very fast Sir, he's Very close but he's moVing very fast Sir, we can't see him any more Get out of the way, damn it! Sir... Come on... Enough. You've run quite a lot. You! Still angry about the girl's death, Officer! Shut up. lf you want to shoot... ...go ahead. ...but don't eVen think about arresting me. All right. Have it your way. Any luck... Verma? No Sir. This place is so huge that Don could be hiding anywhere. Sure, but for how long? All the highways and stations here must be under strict surveillance. Have our men posted in the hospitals nearby. He won't be able to get out of here even if he wants to. ls that understood? Right Sir. No one knows where Don is after the police encounter. Not even the police. l'm afraid that Don... Don what? l think he is dead. Or, do you hope he is dead? You know Mac... l feel that he wanted something to happen to Don! Oh! calm down Anita. - No, l will not calm down. What was your problem with him? Was it that Don had become more important to Singhania than you? Mac... Take her away from here. l'll go myself. But remember... lf what you're saying turns out true. l'll hold you responsible. Good morning Sir... - Good morning Feroz. Feroz! Yes.. Sir. Come here. Perhaps you remember. lt was about a year ago... A man had barged into my office along with a small boy. The boy's parents had disappeared and... ...he found him on the street. l had asked you to file the report. Yes Sir. Bring me that file. Yes Sir. Vijay... Every moment, every day... ...l long for you. O Lord! You must reveal your glory, once again. You must return next year, once again. You must reveal your glory, once again. You must return next year, once again. l will wait for you with longing eyes. Heed me, heed my plea. Come back again. Hear your devotee's plea. Only when l look upon you... will my heart be at peace. Lord O mine... Dear Lord O mine! Be it happy times or days of sorrow... Our hearts chant just one name Because of you, life is comfortable. You dwell in our whole being. Every second... ...l think of you. l am your fan l chant your name in prayer. Heed me, heed my plea. Come back again. Hear your devotee's plea. Only when l look upon you... will my heart be at peace. Lord O mine... Dear Lord O mine! You must reveal your glory, once again. You must return next year, once again. One, two, three, four! Hail Lord Ganesha's glory! Five, Six, Seven, Eight! Lord Ganesha is with us! Lord O mine, Ganpati! May the next year bring you soon! ls it fresh? Here you go, Deepu. Done counting? Yes, uncle. How much is it? Grand total? 3000 Rupees including the last three days. Yuck! What are you doing? Sorry very much. What is the world coming to? My voice has gone hoarse singing for three days and what do we get? 3000 Rupees! Don't worry, Vijay Uncle. - How can l not! We'll make a lot of money over the 9 days of Navratri festival. Wow, Deepu... We'll have to make money... l worry constantly about enrolling you into a good school. Just want you to pass high school! But what can l do? There's no money left after rent and stuff, is there? Hey, don't feel sad. lmagine what your Daddy would say if he met me? "Why thank you! You've got my son onto the street!" lsn't that right? You don't know my Papa. He'd never ever say that. Really! Then what will he say? Vijay... How does your he know my name!? Vijay! Oh! l don't want lce cream Please go! l'm not selling lce cream! DCP Saheb l consider myself pretty smart. Actually l am. But when you are keeping things even from your own department... ...why are you telling me? l mean... this Don Sir? What's he got to do with me? Look at this first. You'll understand everything. Okay. This is ME! You're joking, aren't you? No. No! You're... not joking! So then? ln that case l'm feeling... ...that you want me to take Don's place...? Yes. Don't mind please. Okay. You just told me... ...Don Sir killed one of your informers. To say yes to this job after hearing all this... ...you get what l'm saying? DCP Saheb Look at Don Sir! He uses his gun without thinking twice... ...and me? Forget a gun! l can't eVen use a bicycle! Vijay, l agree this job is dangerous. You don't say? But if we plan each move carefully... ...it can be easily done. Sure... sure... Sir, l'm not afraid of jumping into this well, but... ...you tell me... lf something happens to me? Where will Deepu go? l understand Vijay. You must understand. The people l want to catch with your help... ...find it easiest to get kids, like Deepu, hooked onto drugs. God forbid, if tomorrow... ...he gets addicted to this poison... how will you forgive yourself? Look Vijay. lf you agree... l'll take full responsibility for this boy's education. lt will give Deepu the choice to be whatever he wants... ...a doctor, an engineer... or a police officer like me. All this is possible if you want it. Okay, DCP Saheb But tell me something... lf Don Sir's gang find me out and you find me in a coffin.... Deepu's name won't be cut from the school register, will it? Deepu education will be looked after. l promise. OK... ok... One more question... The fact l am Vijay... ...not Don Sir. ... you alone will know that, right? May God giVe you a long life but what if you pop it... l mean... Don't worry. Nothing will happen to me. Stop.. Papa. Where's Mummy? Making breakfast. And she sent you as her alarm clock, did she? Well, where's the button to switch this alarm off? No.... Thank you Sir. So... what's the problem? Just a moment, Sir... Sir, is this the password you entered? That's the one. F09AK74 lf you remember, while installing the program l had told you... ... the password recorded in this folder will be shown backwards for safety reasons... So your actual password is... 47KA90F Oh God! yes.. l'm sorry. Will that be all, Sir? Stop! right here. ls anybody there?! Hello Jasjit. l hope you are comfortable. Who is this? The man who can rescue you. But you will have to do me a small favor! This is a strange way of asking someone for a favor! l like you, Jasjit. Tell me something... lsn't it true that Joshi's computer alone, can unlock his safe? l don't know. Oh really! That means you were lying to Joshi... ...or are you lying to ME! Look... Think what you want. But, just get me out of here. Why? ls it very suffocating? lf you want, we can send your wife Geeta to be with you. Take it easy Jasjit. Relax! All you need to do is one job. There are diamonds worth 1 0 million dollars in Joshi's safe. Get them and l'll release her. l want to talk to Geeta. Of course. Jasjit... Geeta... l am so sorry... Geeta. This is all my fault. Forgive me. l loVe you. l loVe you too. That's very sweet but l've got diabetes. Now lets talk business. The diamond company Joshi works for... ...is on the 25th floor of Belcourt Towers. The security on the entire floor is the kind required to safeguard diamonds worth 1 0 million. We can get you to the roof via the service lift. Rest... is up to you. Hold it. Right there! Take the bag off your shoulder and put it down. You must be wondering how the police got here. l'll tell you. Mrs.Wadia liVes in the building across the road. She and her husband quarrel pretty often... ...and the poor lady comes out to her balcony to calm down. Guess what she saw from her balcony tonight? lnspector De Silva, please listen to me very carefully. l'm being forced to do this. Some people have kidnapped my wife. You think l am a fool...? What's your name? Jasjit. You're under arrest. Shinde... Jasjit.... Stop. lnspector... They will kill my wife! l must go. Do you understand? l'm telling the truth! May be... But l am not authorised to sympathise with you. Take him away. Any idea where Deepu is? De Silva.. Your days are numbered! Wow! lsn't this something?! He's handsome! You know, sir... seeing a picture is one thing. To be face to face like this... ...Don Sir is alive, isn't he? Yes. The doctors have kept him in a sedated state. l personally believe that a person like Don has no right to live. But l need him now. Vijay, l want you to study him properly... ...understand him... Learn his habits, his mannerisms, everything! l will learn everything. What's the big deal?! Let him wake up at least! As soon as your work is done, l'll hand him over to the police. l get it. First... All the marks and scars that were on Don's body... ...need to be made on you. Sure. On me...!! Yes. The doctors here can do it painlessly. How can it be painless?! Hi.. Ashok. He's all yours. Vijay, this is Dr.Ashok Khilwani. He will operate on you. Everything ready as plan? Yes, just a few preliminary tests and... ...we are ready to get started. l'll check everything. Thanks Ashok. What's the matter? l've never heard that a bullet mark on a shoulder or a scar on the head can be made painlessly. Don't be afraid. - How can l not be!! l was about to tell you... l got Deepu admitted to Malaysia's lnternational School. lnter.... lnt... With that name, it must be good. lt's one of the best. - Best. Now you stop worrying about Deepu and concentrate on your work. Okay... okay... Look, l'll tell you all l know about Don. Besides that, l've thought of another plan. When Don, that means you... ...go back to your companions, you'll be ill and wounded. You will have lost your memory. The more you learn about Don's life... ...the closer l'll get to regaining my memory. Thank you. You think exactly like the comic book hero, Chacha Chaudhary! You Know Chacha? Brain working faster than the computer. l'll tell you a great story. Listen... One day, Chacha Chaudhary took his dog Rocket out for stroll... You want it? Don never ate paan (betel leaf). - Never ate paan!! That wasn't very nice of him, was it! Well, l guess that l must quit too. Fine. Come on Vijay. ls this a binocular? Neha... Yes Doctor... Start monitoring the blood pressure of the patient. Why? - Yes Sir. Anand... Patch me through the face map. Doctor...sir... lt won't be too painful, will it? No, it... How long, before he comes? Well.... Just another 48 hours, Mr. Desilva and then he is all your's. Good job Ashok. Doctor, please come immediately to room no. 2 lts an emergency. My God! What happened Ashok? Don is admitted in that room. What happened? Heart seizure, doctor. Have you given the patient anything to stablize him? Yes Doctor.. 2 ml of adrenaline Get me a cardiac injection, Quick. What's the blood pressure? - 21 0 by 1 20 doctor. l said hurry up. No... God damn it... Ashok... You and your team know nothing about this incident. This operation neVer happened. ls that understood? OK. The success of my plan is linked to this secret remaining a secret. Ashok... lt's only a matter of a few days. Hello... Yes... Where have you seen him? Where did you see him? - Over there The doctors are saying that he has lost his memory. He doesn't remember anything. Still, we must get him back at any cost. You're right... but how? The passport they found in his car was Malaysian... ... and they must send Don back. Don't worry, Mr.Singhania. lt will be done. Go back! Welcome back, Don. That's right. Your name is Don. l am Narang. She is Roma. All of us here, work with you... and you work for Mr.Singhania. You remember Mr.Singhania at least? l don't belive it! ln spite of all the security, they took Don away! Don's testimony could have exposed the entire crime ring. But what can he tell us when he doesn't remember anything? l don't think he's of any use to them now either. Who is them? Mr. Malik, whoever did this either works for Singhania or for his enemy. Like who? Like... ...Vardhaan. Vardhaan... Where is Vardhaan?!! Have you seen him? Do you know where he's hiding? Do we even have a single picture of him? No. Please.... And by the way Mr. De Silva. Memory isn't something that once lost, can't be found. lt's just a matter of time. ls this... ... mine? Yes... For me, Don isn't Don... ...without this. How do l look? You look very dangerous. Mr. Mallik... lt's been 3 weeks since Don's escape. Why can't the police catch him? You tell us where he is and we'll go catch him! Please... Mr. Malik - Look, until we get the right information, or a witness comes forward... ...We must follow police procedure. What's in it? Our contacts, bank account numbers and passwords are all recorded in this. You had made it yourself and put it in the safe. Yes. Yes, Vijay. Tell me. De Silva Saheb... l know enough about Don... ...my memory can return now. Good. We must do this with utmost care. l agree. lf you can't lose your memory without reason... ...then it shouldn't come back without reason either. l've got a solution for that. Tomorrow, make some excuse... ...and come to the place l've fixed. Who are you waiting for? Maybe... you. Oh that... You have done a lot for me... l won't forget that. There's a lot more left to do. That there is . Don...! lt was like this the other day too. l was in my car... ...and the police were chasing me. They were shooting at me... And then l... l remember everything. Who l am! Who all of you are! l remember each and everything! Mac... Remembering your friend's names is one thing.... ...in our business, it's important to remember our enemy's name. Which enemy are you talking of, Narang? Vardhaan or that officer Desilva? Maybe T.J is the one you were thinking about... ..or the man who betrayed us all... Ramesh? l really enjoyed killing them all. This calls for a celeberation. - Oh yes, it does. l am... back. The people in this world. . . have clutched their hearts again! l have returned. . . ... bringing back with me a lot of excitement! Look who's here. Back to rule your world. Who's got you mesmerized? For whom do you wait with open arms? Who is this charming man? Recognize me. l am Don. l bid my life. . . . . .and gamble with death. l have no regret... ...nor do l care.... ...who l make my enemy. No enemy of mine, will liVe too long. l am very dangerous. l am very dangerous... ...and forever cunning. Who is back to win the world over? Recognize me. l am Don. Their eyes inViting... ...many women have wanted me for themselves. But these two eyes that are glancing into mine. . . . . . have mesmerized me. These eyes. . . ...tell me... that they are hiding an intoxicating secret. l am getting addicted to them... and my heart is falling under it's spell Who is here that has fallen under this spell? Recognize me. l am Don. Yes, Vijay? A deal is on at 7 tomorrow morning, outside the city. lf you could come there. . . ...l'll bring the disc with me. l'm sure... ...it has all the information the police wants. Can you come there alone? Rest assured. There'll be no one with me. Mr. Narang, don't you think it's unsafe for Don to go alone? l mean, this deal could also be a setup. Don won't go alone. You will go with him. Don't be silly Narang... Are you telling me that l can't do this job alone? No. l know that you can do it alone. But Mr.Singhania has personally ordered me to do this. Mr.Narang... Can't Vikram or Mac do this job? Why is it important for Roma to go with Don? Because Mr.Narang knows me very well... ... and when, where and who to shoot. . . ...is something l know very well. Singhania... Your time is up. Tomorrow, the disc will be mine and you'll be finished! Tomorrow. . . ! This one word separates me from my success. And don't worry. The police will never find out that l have the disc. Because neither do they know that l am Vardhaan. Nor is my photograph in any of their records. ls this a joke?! No, its not! What is this madness? l have felt this mad since. . . . . .you killed my brother Ramesh and his fiance. Ramesh! Your brother? Yes... And l didn't kill you till now because. . . . . . l wanted you to remember why you were being killed! You don't know this but... l didn't kill your brother. Good bye Don. Stop! That's enough. . . Look! Look at me. Listen carefully. You didn't kill me all these days... ... and for that, l thank you. Now listen to the truth. The truth is. . . He... ...is not Don. Who can say that he is not Don! Besides Vijay and me now... ...only you know the truth. Where is the disc? Vijay... l'm sorry. l thought that. . . No, it doesn't matter. Anyone in your place... ... would haVe been deceived. Mr. Desilva... Your work is done? No... My work isn't done yet. That too will happen. Singhania is coming here. Singhania? Yes, sir. He is coming to Kuala Lumpur for a meeting. l'll inform you of the location as soon as l know. Good. Vijay... You may have done this for Deepu's sake but. . . ... neither me nor the police will ever forget this favor. Who is Deepu? Vijay uncle. . . ! Don't you recognize me? How can l not recognize you? My... Deepu! But, honestly... ... for one second l did wonder, "who is this smart young gentleman running towards me?" This new uniform! New shoes. Well uncle, you aren't the same either! What can l say, Deepu? Your Vijay uncle... ...had to change. But what about your paan? Paan is gone! Just a minute. . . Roma, this is Deepu. Hi Deepu. Nice to meet you. Hello... me too... And Deepu, this is Roma aunty. Uncle, is she your aunty too? - Hey! ls that anyway to speak! Vijay... The things you are doing for this boy....! Who does this in today's time? lf anything would have happened to you today... ...l would never forgive myself! Please forget all about it. Anyway. . . . . . l don't know. . . ... Should l be grateful to Don for making it possible to meet you.. . . .or l should hate him. Because l wonder... ...how you can even sit beside a man . . . . . .who constantly reminds you of your brother's death. l can't punish you for a crime committed by someone else. And please. Stop addressing me so formally. What do l call you then? Aunty? Excuse me... Hello... There is some Mr. Jasjit Ahuja here to see you sir. Jasjit... How are you, Haatim? - Very well. What a surprise? My God, it's been ages since we met! Banglore 2002. Before you came here. Really!.. How time flies! Unbelieveable!... What brings you here? DCP Desilva is in this city right now. Yes... l heard about what happened to you . . . ...l'm sorry. l couldn't do anything for you. But you can now. l want his address, Haatim. What do you plan on doing? What time is the meeting? And Singhania will be there? Good... l'll see you then. Vijay... Well done! Welcome back!... Perhaps you don't know who l am? l know you very well. DCP Desilva. Who are you? Think back! 9th January, Belcourt Towers? 1 0 million dollars worth of diamonds? No! Well, maybe a bullet could help sharpen your memory. Hang on!... Jasjit? Yes... Jasjit. What do you want? l want to kill you! l hope you won't mind too much! Look, Jasjit. . . Maybe what happened to you was wrong... l was only doing my duty. l'm a police officer... ... and right now it's crucial for me to be somewhere. Or else some big criminals will get away. Let me go! How can l let you go? Look at these faces! One of them is my wife. . . . . .who is dead because of you. The other is my innocent son! Who knows where he is now? Look at them... This boy. . . Deepu. . . ls your son?! You know Deepu? Yes. l also know where he is. . . ...but will tell you that, only after l come back. Wrong! You will tell me right now! Jasjit... You can kill me and take your revenge... ... but then give up the hope that you'll see your son again! l don't hate you as much . . . . . .as l love my son. Go. l will wait for you here. Leave that here. You do have to come back, don't you? Night and wine have met we are intoxicated Body and heart are both ready to melt Celebration surrounds us but yet l am anxious Why does my heart beat faster? Why does my heart say... ... "you fools do not know this yet?" Tonight... Who knows what will happen? What will we gain? What will we lose? Tonight... Who knows what will happen? What will we gain? What will we lose? What will happen in just a few moments? What was always mine will be mine again. The night will decide who resides in who's heart The decision has been made... ...that l will be victorious You fools do not know this yet Tonight... Who knows what will happen? What will we gain? What will we lose? Tonight... Who knows what will happen? What will we gain? What will we lose? Come, let me tell you something, secretly Soon, the night is going to change its hue, secretly Then l will take you away with me, secretly Where will you go? Look! Here l am. You fools do not know this yet Tonight... Who knows what will happen? What will we gain? What will we lose? Move it...! Put your gun down. Open the door. Let him go. Shoot, Mr.Malik! Mr. Malik! Shoot him! - Shut up. Let him go. Put your gun down. Shoot, Mr. Malik! Get into the van. Move! Malik! Shoot him. Do you want me to shoot him? Relax... Malik... Close the door. Shut the door. Stop! Turn the engine off! Now..! l mean it. Now! Yes... OK... Thank you. What do you think, Verma? ls this man telling the truth that he is not Don? Don is Very clever, sir. Claiming that he is Vijay, Mr. Desilva's informer... ...is surely a plan to escape punishment. Hmm? Lets do this... Bring Narang and Mac here. Let them hear what he's saying. Perhaps his words... ...can break them. Mr. Malik, how many times do l have to tell you l'm not Don! l'm Vijay... Desilva saheb's informer. lf Singhania's men are behind bars today, it's all due to me. And why don't you go ask Desilva saheb who l am? DCP Desilva is no longer with us. He's dead. Dead? Just a minute! Then... Where's the disc l gave him? What disc? l had given him a disc that contained information of Singhania's contacts and bank accounts. l'm sorry but he didn't mention any such disc. But it must be somewhere! ...in his apartment or somewhere here... in his desk... or... Mr. Malik! lf l were Don... ...how would l know that he had this disc? DCP Desilva's informer has told us quite a lot about you. Now if there is anything, you two would like to say? What are you saying, Mr. Malik? This man is Don. And he is doing what he know's best. What's that? Making police officers like you look like fools. Shut up. Take them away. Verma, take a small team to DCP Desilva's apartment. lf that disc is there... ...it's possible this man is speaking the truth. He is telling the truth. He is not Don. Malik Saheb, l'm telling the truth... l gave De Silva saheb the disc with my own hands! You don't believe me, do you? Don, l gave you a chance... But now even you can't deny the fact that you are Don. l'm sorry. Verma.. just send the guards in! Wait...! There is another proof... Dr.Ashok Khilwani! He operated on me to make me look like Don. Please...! He knows the truth. Please.. Sir... Thank you, Freoze. Malik Saheb... ...did you talk to the doctor? He is not alive. - Not alive?! Last month, he and his assistant died in a car accident. Malik Saheb... Please believe me. l'm not Don! The Court will decide this matter. Please listen to me! l'm Vijay, Malik saheb! l'm not Don, l'm Vijay! Try and understand... Hello Vijay! We heard everything. Don't be silly, Mac. l am Don. l only said that to confuse them. What's happening? Stop it. Narang...! Please make them understand. - Shut up. You are Vijay... But if they attack you here... ...the police will realize... ...are not Don. Get back. Get back...! So... BehaVing a bit too smart, weren't you, boy?! Now get ready to die. The punishment for selling drugs in Malaysia... ...is death... ... and the court will surely give Don the death sentence. lf it doesn't... ... we'll kill Vijay in jail. What happened, sir? They say that, till we get a date in court... ...it's not safe to keep these dangerous criminals here. So what is their intention? They have a high security jail on an island, five miles off the coast. They'll all be flown there first thing tomorrow. Excuse me... l need to use the toilet please...! Very badly...! Hey... Okay. Come through! Hey... hey... - Easy! Okay... okay... Sorry. Come through. Hi... Give me your gun, Please! Just stay there. Come on...! Now the handcuffs... Go on...! Quick! The other one...! Quick... Now give me his gun, Please... Quick... quick...! Take him with the others. Move it! Fast...! Go on...! No..! Congratulations! Jasjit. The information on this disc... ...is like a winning lottery ticket. l know a man who can get you a lot of money for this disc. Jasjit... Desilva said that he knew where Deepu was. Perhaps, the buyer we find may have known Desilva? Haatim... lf he can lead me to Deepu, l'll let him have all that money. l see... And you have this disc. No problem. lt'll be done. Malik... What! What happened, sir? Who was that? An incident on board forced the pilot to make an emergency landing. Don has escaped! Thanks... Thanks for coming! Thank God you're all right! You call this being all right? Vijay... l know what the truth is. The truth...? Why will the police believe you, Roma? Only the disc can prove my innocence now. We"ll get the disc. The man who stole the disc... ... cannot be honest enough to return it to the police. He's sure to try and sell it. Just a minute, Roma. Singhania has an agent here... ...who kept him informed about the cops and our enemies. He could be of use. Try and contact him somehow. But if you are found meanwhile... l mean, the police will be searching everywhere for you. l know! But where can l go?! There is one place. Where is Ramesh's place? Close by. To the right. Stop please. Your's, sir? All units respond... Wait... We have a fugitive situation. Suspect's name is Don. Last seen wearing a dark jacket, trousers and a grey shirt He is of lndian origin. Who are you, saheb? What do you want? How does one explain who he is? Just know that we are in big trouble... ...and need shelter for a while, that's all. lt's not a police affair, eh? Should we tell them? Uncle... lt's a police affair and... ...an affair of the heart too! Well! l get it now. You've run away? No, uncle. l haven't run away... l've been kidnapped! That's great! Where do we witness love like this nowadays?! Come this way, saheb. Come, madam Sit down, saheb. Uncle... Saheb! Bhaang! (Milk brewed with Marijuana plant extract) Bhaang? Tonight is Mahashivratri (lndian festival in honor of Lord Shiva) ...it is a holy offering to Shiva. Drink! Oh, the lord will bless you for drinking his favourite brew! You also try it. Cheers... Happy Mahashivratri everyone. lt's all right, brother! Honestly speaking, uncle... lf l had listened to my mother when l was a boy... l wouldn't be seeing these days! Why? What did she say? When l never listened to her, how can l tell you what she said! lf you're done, can we please leave? Leave! But where do we go? De Silva... DCP saheb! You set up a good way to get me up there before you left..! Well done! Saheb... paan! Hey buddy! l don't want it! Eat it. lt's from Benaras. Really? But Don didn't eat paan. Never... Don, who? Don.... Who??! Don means me, meaning Vijay a.k.a Don, meaning... Paan! - Pawn!! l didn't understand a thing. How do l tell you, brother? The plight l am in. Tell us... tell us... l set out to eat "halwa" (hot lndian dessert)... ...and ended up burning my mouth! What can l say? How can l explain? l'm in a bad situation... ...that's hard to escape. lt's like a violent storm! lt's like a raging wind! l've had to... ...run for my life! A long and winding... ...chase has been on! Day and night, l've been awake... ...running helter skelter. Sometimes this way! Sometimes that way! Sometimes this way! Sometimes that way! Ran this way once and that way next!! Then you gave me this paan... ...and life has returned to my tired body! Eating a paan from Benaras... ...unlocked my benumbed brain. Eating a paan from Benaras... ...unlocked my benumbed brain. Now watch the things l'll do... ...to straighten up everyone This boy... ...this boy from the banks of the Ganges! Eating a paan from Benaras... ...unlocked my benumbed brain. l've been cursed! ...to be caught up in this maze, alas! My life is in limbo... ...l'm at the hangman's mercy, alas! So honest and simple, So innocent... yes l am. Don't know how l ended up amid this educated lot!! With a sweetened knife... With a sweetened knife they'Ve slit my throat! This boy from the banks of the Ganges! Eating a paan from Benaras... ...unlocked my benumbed brain. A lovely lass, unique and desirable... ...her enrapturing charm turns all heads... ...wherever she goes... and her body sparkles like precious stones Her dazzling eyes carry a world of dreams... ...her lips, youth's nectar A flirtatious swagger in her walk... ...sprinkles the air with her sandalwood-scented body The vision of her sets your heart aflame Her face is moon-bright. Her eyes like a gazelle Her face is moon-bright. Her eyes like a gazelle She is beautiful... ...as sweet as honey A beautiful maiden... ...has fallen for me, alas! A sweetened skewer... ...has pierced my heart, alas! So bright and fair she's a spicy lass A fighting spirit to match she stole my heart Now that l have her love... Now that l have her love my life has blossomed! This boy from the banks of the Ganges! Eating a paan from Benaras... ...unlocked my benumbed brain. Eating a paan from Benaras... ...unlocked my benumbed brain. Now watch the things l'll do... ...to straighten up everyone This boy... ...this boy from the banks of the Ganges! Yes... Yes, it's me. There's a buyer for the disc here. Yes, ready to pay in dollars. Just a minute. You should speak directly. We have Deepu. lf you want to see him alive, bring the disc.. Jasjit... lf you want to see your son alive... ...bring that disc at 5 pm sharp to this address Jasjit... Haatim Qureishi? - Yes? May l come inside? Who are you? l've nothing personal against you. But if you don't hand over the disc to me... ...l'll be forced to... ...change my mind. What disc? The one you wanted to sell Roma.. Remember? Sorry... The disc is with my friend, Jasjit. And where is your friend, Jasjit? Where's the disc? Where's Deepu? Deepu will come. Call me when he does... ...you already have my phone number! Jasjit... Seeing your punctuality... l must say... ...l'm very impressed! Desilva...?! No... Vardhaan. Vardhaan...? But you... - ...are dead?!! Right? For a man who can keep the police in the dark for years... ...creating the drama of a mere accident is no big deal! Do you want me to shoot him? Relax... Malik... Shut the door. Let's go. Stop! Turn the engine off. l mean it. Come on. You're very cunning. Thank you. Now all l want is the disc... ...which you will give me. l don't belieVe it. Now l get it! Why the police didn't find the diamonds in that basement. l recognise that ring. What did you think? l brought the disc with me! Do you think l am a fool? Remember? That night, you had asked me the same question! You have a Very good memory. lt'll help in recognizing your son. Daddy... Deepu... Vardhaan... lf anything happens... Relax J.J! l don't enjoy bloodshed. All l want is... ...the disc. All right... You'll get it. Jasjit here. Bring the disc. My man will reach here at 7. You and your son will... ...remain my guests till then. Phone... please? Take him away. Kill them when you have the disc! Are you okay, son? Deepu... Listen carefully. As long as they do not get what they want... ...our life is not in danger. But daddy! At 7, when your... - Nothing will happen at 7. Nobody is going to come. That phone call was to buy us time. l'm scared, daddy. Don't be, my son. l'm with you now. Nothing will happen to you. Nothing will happen. Yes, Mr.Vardhaan. Nobody has come so far. Okay. Find them. Now where, daddy? - Keep it down! Just a minute. Let me see. They must be hiding close by. Keep looking. There, he is. Don't shoot. Only he knows where the disc is. Daddy... Vijay uncle...! Daddy, stop! This is Vijay uncle. He took care of me when you went away. Vijay uncle, this is my Daddy. Take it. Vijay... But for you, l don't know where Deepu would be today. Please Jasjit..! Whatever l did for him... Deepu is a lovable boy. Anyway, why do you need this disc so badly? Just know that the only way out of the mess l'm in... ...is this disc... ...and your testimony l don't understand. Your testimony will prove... ...that this disc was with DCP Desilva. DCP Desilva?! Yes. He was the only one in the police department who knew... ..that he is not Don, but Vijay. But after he died... He is not dead! His real name is Vardhaan. And just a little while ago... l met him! No! This can't be. l mean... your eyes must have deceived you!! No, l have not been deceived. DCP Desilva is Vardhaan!! He made me pose as Don... ...obtained the disc... ...and a chance to kill Singhania. Then faked his own death... ...and left me to die as Don. DCP Desilva... Vardhaan! You've played a big move! But he must neVer haVe thought... ...that l'd steal the disc. Give the disc to Vardhaan! Vijay! What are you saying? Yes, Roma. A final meeting with DCP Desilva is very important. Don't worry, darling. Today will be the last day of Vijay's life. l've reached the place you told me to... ...alone. Good. Buy a ticket from the counter. There's a bridge on level one... ...come there. And yes... ...don't forget the money... ...or you'll have to buy the ticket again. You seem to be in a great hurry. Now where do l go? Throw the bag down. What!? Throw the bag down. l can see you, Jasjit... ...but l don't see the disc. You'll get what you want. Throw it. Looks good. Where's the disc? Upper viewing platform. Silver briefcase. Damn! Poor DCP Desilva! You! What are you doing here? l should be asking you that! You're dead, remember? What do you want? - Answers to some questions. Please! This is no time for interviews! All right then. Here's the second reason. l'm going to kill you today. You have the guts to shoot? You've trained me pretty well. What will you gain by killing me? There are some deeds in which profit and loss doesn't matter. They just have to be done. Very good! But how will you proVe your innocence, if you kill me? Only l know your real identity. Perhaps that disc can be of use. What do you think? You have the disc? No... lt was my love for you that dragged me here! Give me the disc. l'm ready to send you to any corner of the world. Think it over. You must be exhausted running from the police! Not as much as from thinking over and oVer... ...why you betrayed me? Come on, get over it. What betrayal?! This is the real world. You think Singhania asked me before seizing Boris' entire empire? l created the entire business! With my intelligence and guts. And now to get it back, l can use thousands like you. All right. l betrayed you. You want an apology? l'm so sorry, Vijay! Happy? Feel any better?!! Use your head, Vijay. There's still time... Join me. You will gain from it... ...and so will l. That's the signal! All teams move in. l repeat all teams move in. Good boy! Come... Put your gun down. This is the police. l repeat... Put your gun down. Stop, Vijay! Don't make this mistake. Hand him oVer to us. Please kill me! You will be making a huge mistake if you let me live. Don't listen to him! He is trying to set you up!! Shut up! Remember! Wherever you go... someday l will find you... And that day will be the last day of your life! Don't listen to him, Vijay. After that, Roma. Then, Deepu. l'll kill them both... ...unless you kill me now. ln that case, Vardhaan... ...l'll be waiting for you. Hurry up. Take him quickly! Vijay? Hold on please. You finally did it. You proved your innocence. lt wasn't possible without you. Thank you. Sir, we must take you to the hospital right away. Yes, of course! Come with me Roma. Excuse me? Can't she come along with us? l'm sorry sir. Ma'am, please step aside. Don't worry, l'll see you at the hospital. Vijay! l loVe you. Even l like wild cats a lot. Come closer. l like wild cats a lot. Wild cats! Mr. Malik, where's that ambulance going? One minute sir... To the hospital. Why, what's the matter? He is Don! "l like wild cats a lot..." Don had said that to me... whispered it in my ears! lf this is Vijay, how did he know it? Diazepam (a sedative)? Yes Sir, Giving it right now. Good. The doctors have kept him in a sedated state. All the marks and scars that were on Don's body... ...need to be made on you. Sure. On me! l was about to tell you... l got Deepu admitted to Malaysia's lnternational School. When Don, that means you... ...go back to your companions... ...you'll be ill and wounded. You will have lost your memory. The more you learn about Don's life... ...the closer l'll get to regaining my memory. Thank you. You think exactly like the comic book hero, Chacha Chaudhary! Weren't you trying to quit? What all can l quit? l've quit everyone... except you. Really Don. l thought that you would get caught today... ...or that l'd lose you. To whom... Roma? What about the disc that the police... - That's fake. What's on it means nothing! Don't worry, sweetheart. Now the reins of Asia's underworld is in my hands! l am the king! As for catching me... Always remember this! Please... Not only is it difficult to catch Don....
