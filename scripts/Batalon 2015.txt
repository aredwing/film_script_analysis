The army has been destroyed. A Provisional Government headed by Alexander Kerenskiy has taken charge. Times are tough, chaotic and desperate... - Thanks! - Good luck, Lieutenant. - To the city. Dvorcovaja Street. - Three rubles... That rate is apalling. It used to be one ruble. It looks like you haven't visited St. Petersburg in a while, sir. One ruble is worthless since february. Go! - You came from the frontline? - The front of the frontline... Since Kerenskiy is in charge, it has been a chaos here. Many people were released... Political prisoners, thugs, murderers... All kinds of lunatics walk the streets at night. There is no law. And there is a new police. What do they do? Absolutely nothing! Just like at the front. Nadya, you sound a bit apathetic. You pause for too long. Mom, I sing the way maestro Piccoli taught me. I'm your mother and I know what's right. And... Miss, Miss... A letter from the front. Mom... What happened? - Nadya... Nadenjka, what happened? - Petya was killed. He was engaged to... ...Vera.. I'll take revenge. I've come to say goodbye. I'm off to the front. I'm going to the Bochkareva women's battalion. I'm leaving at once. Me too. Nadya, what are you talking about? I'll join Vera, Mom. Froska... Frosenjka, bring her back! Please, bring her back! What can I do? Wait, wait... I'll give you what you want! Just get her back, please! I'll do everything I can... Thank you, thank you very much... I will, ma'am. Thank you very much... - Here and thank you. - You're welcome. Lieutenant... What happened? Where were you? God only knows. The train only went to New Peterhof. I had to improvise a way to get here. So, gentlemen. Our main attack will be on the southwestern front. The Eleventh and Seventh Army will go to Lviv. The Eighth Army... Please excuse me, gentlemen... Please excuse me, gentlemen... there are more important things now. We need to develop a plan of attack. I am skeptical about the combat readiness of our army. What do you think? I'll be honest. The soldiers have been blinded by idiotic slogans about a false freedom. They don't want to fight. What are you talking about? False freedom? Our department is preparing a report on... the state of combat readiness at the moment. - I'll show you the report. - Go ahead, Colonel. Proceed. - Don't beat around the bush. - Sure. Please, open the curtains! If you don't mind. A projector! Turn off the lights, please! Go! This is part of the 256th Elisabeth regiment. The soldiers refuse to fight. They organize meetings and hang out with the Germans. The Germans encourage them to revolt. They offer them alcohol... Their pamphlets are written in correct Russian. And this is the 525th Regiment, First Siberian Corps. The idea of freedom, together with a good German brandy, leaves them completely unfit for the army. They're not interested in defending the homeland, and the Soviet army is falling apart. Stop! That's enough! Turn on the lights! Colonel, I don't like these images. To me, this looks like skillfully edited material and nothing more. Mr. Kerenskiy, please remember... I'm an officer, not a cheating thief. Open the curtains, please! If you want to save the army and the state, we need to restore the death penalty. Desertion, mingling with the enemy.. and disrespect for superiors must be punished with the death penalty. - Bravo, Colonel. - Be quiet! Only a miracle can save us. No, not a miracle... but concrete actions of the Provisional Government. On my command, the Bochkareva women's battalion was created. This will raise morale in the army. Women will die after the first shots. Is that what you want? Of course not. That is why, Mr. Polovtsev, I order you to oversee.. preparations for sending a battalion to the front. Next! Excuse me, please... name, age... Do you have children? - I left my family. - So go! Next! Vera! Next! How nice... Please, request a medical examination. Next! Application form. Kolokolchikova Evdovkiya Efimovna. What are you doing here? 18 years, no children. You are too short for service. The doctors will decide about that. Please, type: Evdovkiya Efimovna. Are you crazy? War is not for women. I'll be with you. Why act so strange? Sign me up! Nadezhda Petrovna! Froska! I'm going with you! My dear! I went with Vera. Hello, Vera Dmitrina! Frosenjka! Name, Age! -36, Nadezhda Sergeyevna...... I'm from the country... Name, Age! Medical Examination. - I serve the Countess Tatishcheva. - You will serve the fatherland. Ma'am, step aside. You were rejected. I don't understand... Svistunova Galina Mikhailovna. Why was I rejected? It's obvious, you're too fat. Me? I'm fat? Do you have children? - I'm fat... - Where are you going? So I'm fat? Well, I'm not just fat... I'm strong as well. Look at that. Why did you come here? To destroy our facility? No... I want to go fight, ma'am. If I can bend a poker... I can do the same with the Germans, right? What's your name? Dusya Grynyova. Evdovkiya Grynyova, I appoint you as my Deputy. - Nikolai Alexandrovich! - Yes! - Get her papers ready! - Aye! Mariya Leontiyevna! The general arrived. He wants to see you. Come on! Let's fill out the paperwork. General. Pending the recruitment for the women's battalion. Commander Lieutenant Bochkareva. At ease. God would not give me a son. This is all I can offer. My daughter. I will receive your report. Ms. Senior Lieutenant, The recruit Natalya Tatishcheva awaits her orders. - Do you know how to shoot? - I do. I finished my training in summer camps. I traveled with my father. My maid Serafima Pluzhnikova also knows how to shoot. She must have already arrived here. - Welcome to the battalion. - Thank you! This way, please. Go! I hope you know what you're doing. Mariya Leontiyevna. May God be with you. - Miss... - No more Miss. Cut it! Sit down. Attention! At ease! Everyone but the left wing must turn their head to the left.. and line up with the shoes of the fourth man next to you. Attention! What are you looking at? How can I see anything when her boobs are this big? Line up according to the size of our breasts, Commander! Silence! Align with the tip of your shoes. - Good morning, recruits! - Good morning! From now on I will be called "Ms. Commander"! This is my Deputy, Lieutenant Seleznev. These are the instructors. Alexei Kolokolchikov and Yefim Zadorozhnyy. They will train you.. and prepare you for the final test. Because you are not yet a battalion, but just ordinary women. Therefore, I order you, send home everything that makes you look like a woman. Whoever disobeys this order will be expelled from the camp. - I need soldiers. Is that clear? - Yes, Ms. Commander! Nyura! Come here! Jew, get out of here! Beat it, I said! This is your bed. Girls, look! Look at you! What are you doing? Bitch! Give me a break! We didn't come here to quarrel. Listen, Countess... Stay in bed, okay? We're all equal here. Or don't you like to be with us? Evdovkiya... You're in charge here. Restore order. Dusya, look! This bed would be great for you. There's no draught here and it's away from the door. And you, Countess, you go there! Am I right, Dusya? Well... Will we be divided into nobles and others when we're in the trenches? Listen, you snob... I'm in charge. So pack your your shit and get out of here. Okay, I'll go. But you're not being honest. You just want this bed because it seems best. Are you contradicting me? - You will stand on a chair for two hours! - I will not do it! - What did you say? - Punish her, Dusya! Go ahead and try... I heard everything. We'll solve the problem. You want that bed? No problem. You... go to that bed. And you... go to that one. Then you will swap positions. You'll be downgraded to ordinary soldier. And you will be Second Lieutenant. The banner. The banner! At ease! Get up! Faster! Get dressed! Fast! Why did you stop? Forward! Those who are afraid, can go home. First row, go! Go! Come on! Continue! Jump! Give me your hand! Dusya, what about you? The Germans won't wait. It's nothing. I can handle it. Damn! What did you do? Didn't you say the Germans won't wait? Natasha... - What's the matter? - I'm dizzy. - Did you get hurt? - No, I didn't. It's nothing. Come on, Jevdokiya, faster! Bravo! Come on, jump! Wait! 478... I'll buy the cow... Easy, easy... Get up! If you can smell almonds, apples or rotten hay, the enemy has just attacked you with gas. This is a gas grenade launcher, It can shoot gas grenades. Aim! Fire! - These are my shots, Lieutenant. - No... These are yours. - Poor shooting. - I will improve, Lieutenant. - Bad attempt. - I'll shoot you in the head. Fire! Down! Get up! Fire! Here it is... Excellent shot. I'm glad. Keep moving! They'll kill you if you get tangled. Lie down, I'll cut the wire. Try not to hurt your ass. I don''t want a woman with no ass. Go, go, go... Recruits, attention! You... And you... Come here! Stand next to eachother! Hit her! - Where? - In her face. Now you. I can't. Hit her! - I can't. - Then you'll hit. With the fist! Hit her! - I can't. - Do it! - Enough! - Do it! - I can't.. - Hit her in the stomach! So... Hit her! - I can't. - Do it! - I can't. - Hit her! Come on, everyone! Against each other! Come on, fight! Hit! I hit you! You have to learn to fight. Like this... Tonya! - What happened? - Come with me! Help me! That's not necessary. He's mine, mine forever... Don't close the window. Okay. Slowly, slowly... First row forward! Second row forward! We'll have beef. - How do you know? - I can smell it. I've always had a good sense of smell. It's good to have a well developed sense of smell. Comrade Commander, I need to talk. - What do you want? - Can I talk to you in private? Well, come on. I met someone. Help me out for one night, Leontiyevna... Because... we'll soon go to the front. No. Why not? Don't you understand? You're a woman, right? No. So that's the pecking order here? Why can she leave? Every night she escapes out of the window to join the boys. You should know what your subordinates do. So you're a snitch? Are you okay? Get lost! - Who is it? - It's her! Her? Who did you visit? I asked who did you visit? No one. Listen, officer! With some friends I'll create a Military Committee. Yes... we want freedom and equality. Get up! If I see you again, you'll be a target in the shooting range. Then I'll be the one asking for freedom! Get out! Out, I said! There's your freedom! - You haven't seen the last of me! - Yes, and of me! Anyone else? Eat your lunch before it's cold. You know, Mariya Leontiyevna. We have waited for years... and now she can perform abroad. My Nadyenka is a singer. She's not a soldier. She must take care of her voice. That's why I paid Froska... to take care of my Nadyenka, to bring her home safely. Now I understand. Don't worry. Lieutenant! Gerasova and Lavancova must report to headquarters. Gerasova and Lavancova reporting. You were paid with jewelry. You were going to take care of the lady. You can go. Frosenjka, you can keep what I gave to you. The situation has changed. Nadya has to travel. Excuse me, miss. Mom, did you really pay her? Nadyenka, I just wanted you to be okay. We have waited a long time for this. Nadya! It's La Scala! Permission to return to combat instructions. Permission granted. - You raised a beautiful girl. - Thank you. Ma'am! Here... These are your things. Make sure nothing is missing. All this is yours. I'm sorry, ma'am! Frosenjka, what... Thank you. Let me return to the battalion. Is it your own decision to stay? Yes... it is. Then go! Thanks! Goodbye, ma'am! Goodbye! Your daughter did the right thing. - Commander Bochkareva? - Yes, how I can help you? The District Commander, General Polovtsova, has ordered your arrest. Hand me your gun. Gentlemen officers. You're ordered to return to headquarters, where you will be reassigned. Follow me. - Do you understand why you were arrested? - No. I don't understand. - How can you allow a stupid... - Please... Be quiet. You, a senior officer in the battalion, have hit a subordinate. The comrades have agreed to resolve this peacefully. There is just one condition. Tell her. St. Petersburg SOVDEP demands that the women's battalion Bochkareva, establishes a Military Committee, headed by my friend.. ... I mean... ... Svistunova. Please excuse me for a moment. Here's to dividing the battalion! - Here! - Attention! The battalion will last until tomorrow...... Then it will be dissolved. You're under arrest for insubordination. You will lose your rank. And you'll be thrown out of the Russian Army. Until then, you remain in custody. - Sorry, Peter Alexandrovich. - Dismissed! Battalion, halt! To the left! Halt, you can't go there! Sorry, Mr. Alexandrovich, for storming inside. At ease! I'm listening. General Peter Alexandrovich... The Mariya Bochkareva Battalion arrived in full force. We would like to know why our Commander was arrested. Deputy Commander, Natalya Tatischeva. The Countess? You're Ilya Vladimirovich's daughter? Affirmative! It's not important now. Well... I'll keep it in mind. Your Commander was arrested for disobeying the order.. to establish a Military Committee. General, you are not well informed. A Military Committee has been established. Therefore Mariya Bochkareva should be acquitted. Don't be silly. - Where is your Committee? - Outside, General. The Committee consists of the entire battalion. You're dismissed. Give my regards to your father. I can't do it. What kind of women are they... Battalion, line up! Attention! General. The Military Committee of the female battalion Bochkareva is lined up. We are... distressed. Please release Ms. Commander to return to the head of her unit. Back to the ranks. Ms. Commander, retake the command. Tomorrow we'll review this battalion. Understood, sir! Hooray! Please note... If only one of you.. fails the exam, noone will go to the front. The battalion will be dissolved. What will happen tomorrow? Quiet, Serafima! You'll wake up everyone. But what should I do? My dear... Lord, help me... Serafima... What is it, Natasha? Well... If you tell them, I won't forgive you. What's wrong? Why can't you sleep? What happened? Tell her! What I have to say is... that her father died, her husband died... She has nobody left... Why should a child die? What? What child? I'm pregnant. Thanks for trying to protect us. But tomorrow could put the entire battalion in jeopardy. I had a feeling you were pregnant. Line up. Are you ready? Line up, please! Second Lieutenant Tatischeva, Give me your banner. Miss... Take it! Be my Deputy. Instead of Natalya. At your orders. Get in line. Go home! Save your child. We're going there to die. Go away. At ease. Get some sleep. Battalion! Now we'll see how you do as soldiers! If one of you fails, the entire battalion will be declared unfit. Forward! The first and third row left, and the other to the right! March! Nadya! What happened? Don't pick up the wounded! Hurry, go on! - Come on! - I think I sprained my ankle. Fire! Come on, Nadya! Commissioner. Lavancova, Gerasova and Neklyudova have passed the obstacle course. Let us stand in line! No, I will not allow it. You have passed the obstacles incorrectly and stained the honor of the entire battalion. You're wrong, Ms. Commander.. We were ordered to pass the obstacle course and we did. You arrived too late. We stood here waiting for you! So what? We weren't told there was a time limit. Or were we, Mr. General? A Commander has a duty to follow orders. Or else she would no longer be a Commander, right? You're right, damn it. She's right! You have not left a comrade, and I appreciate that. Get in line. - Does your leg hurt much? - Only a little. Come on, get in line. After testing the combat readiness of the battalion.. I declare that you have successfully passed the test. You will need to take an oath to be integrated into the regular army. Bravo! Thanks, Peter Alexandrovich. In the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit... Amen! Battalion... Forward, march! Attention to the left! Stop! Stop! Tonjka! Tonjka, I will not let you go. My daughter, how will I live without you? You'll get killed in this war. Mom, don't embarrass me. Forgive me... Goodbye. Be careful with the wounded... Get the next one! - Guard! - Yes! - Look, there are more of them. - I'll take care of it. Vera! The second group will leave soon. I can't believe it. It's a miracle! Not a miracle. We're going to the front. Wait, wait... Nadya! Petya, Petya... It's me... Nadya. Over here! Nikolai Alexandrovich, help her. Well girls, let's go. Get in the wagons! The train is about to leave! Miss. Miss... we have to go. Wait... Who is he? My fianc. Open your eyes... Please, open your eyes. I love you. Here is your medallion. Nadya, we're leaving! Nadya! No, let her stay. Ladies, soldiers, look at me. Well done... Convoy, stop! At ease! Battalion! Get ready to defend! Come on, beauty. Give me a kiss. If you stab me in the heart, the bayonet will break. Just a kiss, honey. Bitch! Of course I'm a bitch! I was a bitch 1914, when I dragged the wounded on my back. What did you think I was? Why do you think we're here? Do you think we came here to make out with you on the grass? We came to fight. To help you fight the Germans. You are our brothers. Look at the angry bitch. A real bitch. Your brain is rotten from alcohol and the nonsense you spout. All of you! How can you allow this to happen? Should women do the fighting for you? While you go out partying? Comrades! She is our Bochkareva! She once rescued me and Pankratov. Pankratov, Pankratov! Where the hell...? I'm here, I'm here... Comrades.. This woman is one of us. A warrior, not a woman... but also a comrade and a friend. I remember you. How can you forget a man of 130 kilo? Alright comrades... it's decided then. We'll treat the women with respect... there's no need to kill us with your bayonets. But remember, the Military Committee has decided, that it's pointless to continue the war. We want to live to return to our homes. But because of you the war continues. The air is fresh here. What did the Committee say, Smarczuk? Did we walk here from St. Petersburg, just to betray our country like you have? If you defy the decisions of the Committee, you'll regret it. Come on, comrades! Let's go! Battalion, at ease! Disperse. Battalion, halt! Lieutenant, where is Colonel Borozdin? - Inside. - Take me there! Yes, Second Lieutenant. We've disintegrated completely. - I will not fight. - Please! Send the battalion to the frontline of defense. It's urgent, do it now. That's fine with me. There's no need to walk around in front of my horny soldiers. Soldiers? You call them soldiers? Soldiers? Where did you see any soldiers? These are no longer my soldiers. They're drunks and criminals. You'd better stay away from them. How many are in the first line of defense? In the first line, Ms. Commander, there's nobody. Only the German couriers that bring the brandy. - Allow me to go there. - Go. Seleznev! My dugout is on the left and yours is on the right. Understood. Mariya Leontiyevna, I should check the machine guns. Okay. Continue. Mother! The Germans wanted to fight. They could not believe it. I picked flowers in front of their noses. You should have taken the broom to clean up a bit. And what's the problem? They're our flowers. Russian. The Germans are coming! - Hands up! - Hello! We have come to bring gifts. Gifts. Salami, meat, brandy... - For you. - Freeze! You should be ashamed. We are regular soldiers like you. We are brothers. We do not want to fight. We are your brothers. I'm not your brother or sister. As long as you're on our land, you're our enemies. Hands up! Get the Commander. - How many guns do we have? - Eighteen. Write: Eighteen machine guns. Ms. Commander, excuse me.. We have prisoners. Brothers... with knives in their belts. What's this? "Kan" and "Panz." Are they abbreviations for guns and armored vehicles? No. Nyet. What? Our guests? Ms. Commander, we caught two Germans. With brandy and with this. This is what it says in German: Meaning cannons, armored vehicles, soldiers, officers... They are spies. Tie him down! Calm down, girl. Come on, calm down... You're my girls. Everything will be fine. Yes, you killed him. It was the only thing you could do. You did what was needed. Everything will be fine. He's not breathing. - Take him to the headquarters. - I'll take him. I'll join her. Okay. Come on, darling. Calm down. Stop! Come on! - Are you okay? - I can't continue. I twisted my ankle. I must return. I'll bring him by myself. My name is Josef Zepp. What's your name? Go! Listen, I did nothing wrong. And neither did you or the other Russian soldiers. What are you mumbling? I don't understand anything anyway. I have two daughters in Bavaria. They are like you. Gudrun and Helga. Do you understand? You're too young. Children should stay at home. At home. Do you understand? Where do you live? In St. Petersburg. There's a district called Martyshkino. Ah... 'martishka'.. - Like the tiny monkey. - You're a tiny monkey. Help me. Please. Why didn't you go home? - Thanks, my friend. - Have a good day! Having lunch? Be careful not to choke. She's still a girl. Why did you bring this child? To die? She died. No! Don't touch her! Whatever. Little girl... This happened because of me. It's my fault. I... I was wrong. Forgive me. Excuse me. It was my fault. What a beautiful machine gun, easy to use, with a cartridge belt.. and a rate of fire... of six hundred bullets... per minute. Six hundred Germans could die in a minute. And in two minutes? Vera. How many Germans can you kill in two minutes? If you aim well, the entire nation. I've always been lucky. I could have lived like any other woman, not knowing there's such a thing as a machinegun. It was devised just.. so I could handle it. If there are Germans, I will tear them down. We've been here for a month. And there's no war. Nadenjka, who are you writing? I wrote to Petya in the hospital. Now I'm writing my mother. Wish him all the best. There's a strange smell. It smells like apples. Gas attack! Girls, here! Put on your gas masks. Fire! Forward! Battalion, attack! Are you okay? Did you go to the hospital? No... it's just a little scratch. Here you go, here's your... Here you go, here's your... Here you go, here's your... Here you go, here's your... What happened? Come on! Here it is, here it is... Here you go, here's your... Here you go, here's your... Here you go, here's your... Here it is, here it is... Cut it with that shit! I'm proud of their bravery. I'm going to nominate them for a medal. You as well. We didn't come here to get decorated. The Germans are afraid of us. My unit is ready for an offensive. Your men will help us. Who? Soldiers. You'll be disappointed. Thank your battalion for everything. You're dismissed. Lord Jesus Christ, help me... What do you want? You know what happened. The people have spoken. There's been a revolution. The Tsar was overthrown. So what? Soon the Motherland will be shared by the Russian people. Why should we expose our heads to bullets? We, you, the Germans. They have children as well. Their women return home to their husbands and children. Precious, are you married? I care. I remember my husband, and the suffering of children. Don't you care if the Germans are on Russian soil? - You're not convinced? - No. I'm not convinced. Afanasij. Afanasij. Hello, my wife. Whore! Why call me a whore? And why call me me... a bandit? I prefer to live like a bandit. You beat me and tortured me... Do you remember? Let's forget everything and go back home. I'm not going. You disappoint me. - Are you crazy? - Go away! Whore! You left me! Are you happy now? Go to hell! We've watched this for four hours now. It's evident. The analysis leads us to the conclusion.. that there are no units capable of carrying out an attack. - There are no units at the front? - Only one remains. Nadya! - Lieutenant! - You're making a mess! Sorry! If you look at the facts, I think the attack will be impossible. Colonel, I know best what the army can or cannot do. Stop. Turn on the light, please. Forgive me. Can I withdraw? I will not hold you. Colonel Alexei Leonidovich... Please, let me go to the front. I'll go anyway. We'll leave together. Tomorrow. We'll attack. The Army Commanders have three days.. to plan the operation. God help us. Vera, you're in charge. As soon as I light the fire, you attack. This battle will be worse than the first. Soldiers, follow me! Alarm! Lieutenant! - What's that noise? - The attack has begun, Colonel. - Since when? - Since midnight. Give me your hand! Nadya, take the flag! Cadet Jevdokija Grinjova! Come here! I thank you for your efforts! I do it for the Fatherland! - Are you the one who can smell poison gas? - Yes, mom. Don't say "Yes, Mom," Say "Yes!" Lieutenant! Take the child to a secret location. She can anticipate gas attacks. The Germans will attack again. At your command! - Vera, report to headquarters! - Yes! You can go with her, and sing about our victory. Understood! Tell them that we won't hold out here for much longer. Let them send the men. Clean up a little before you go. The rest of you, clean your weapons and get some rest. I have no one to send. An entire nation and there is no one to send? This is not a nation. This is a bunch of losers and traitors. - They can't all be crooks. He's lying. - What are you saying? If we don't send reinforcements, the Germans will recapture it. Gather the men. Follow me. Soldiers! The women of the battalion Bochkareva have followed the order to attack. They have pushed the Germans back to their initial position. They need reinforcements. They need our help. What is this circus, Comrade Colonel? As for the offensive, I think we made the right decision. Or maybe you don't remember? Women are women. They have stirred the pot, now they can eat it. Shut up, Zopov! You're an animal. Our women are out there. You lie the moment you open your mouth. Our women are at home. Awaiting our return. You're dismissed, comrades! No volunteers? This can't be true! Forgive me. Men are like children. They love to love, to eat... ... and listen.. What? Have you been seeing someone? What are you talking about? How could you think such a thing? That's something... Stop! We have arrived. I'm here. This way. Hello, who are you? Where are you going? - Colonel Ceplyayev from the General Staff. - No, no, no... I can't let you pass. I have to report to the Military Committee first. - Wait here until I'm back. - Get out of my way! That... That's all! Who does he think he is? Damn dog... Colonel Ceplyayev from the General Staff. Excuse me. They don't even tell me when there's an inspection. I did not come for an inspection. We came to fight. How come there's no one in Russia, except officers from the General Staff.. to fight at the front? Bring the horses. I want to go to the front. Horses? That's not possible. This is no time for jokes. Shut up! Would you like horses? That's him! He's the one that hit me. Karpenko, Glacko, Zazurin! - Get horses for the officers. - I have one question. Where? Where? - Do not argue! Horses! - There are no horses. Get out of my way! Please note, officers don't take part in combat. If they do, they will be executed. Lieutenant, follow me! Put the gun down! There's no need. Not bad... Let's see... Get out of the way! - Only officers are denied passage? - That's right. We're no longer officers. You know... the person I'd like to find... Germans! - Vera, quickly! - Yes, I get it! Kolya! Kolya, Kolya... Kolya, please! Kolya, breathe, breathe, Kolya... Breathe, breathe, Kolya... Back! Girls! This way! Damn! Retreat! Don't shoot. Don't shoot! Wait! - Where are you going? - Let me take a look. Nadya! - And...? - They're coming. From two sides. My girls... You have to forgive me. Goodbye! Lord God Almighty. Our fate is in your hands. Do not abandon us. Watch over us. We will forever be grateful to you. Don't let us fall into enemy hands. Don't let the enemy rejoice. We will do this for our savior, in your name. Give us the spirit and strength. And the courage to offer our blood and soul in your name. If you're on our side, please help us. Amen! This was the last battle of the women's battalion. Inspired by the example of the Bochkareva battalion, women have established new battalions. Russia was on the brink of a new civil war. MARIYA Bochkareva The training camp has continued to train new soldiers since 1920.
