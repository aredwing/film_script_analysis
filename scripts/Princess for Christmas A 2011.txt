You're a swordsman? -That's for sure. -It's hockey team. I do not like hockey. It's just a bunch of fools skating on the ice, which lack teeth. Not like cricket. This is at least proper sport for men! -It's weird! -Not just weird old! -How long will you stay? Why? He would've wanted us zabvit? -I was kidding! -I know. Children, there's something to what you wanted to ask your grandfather? Why have you ignored us for so many years? -Milo! -It's okay. The truth is that your mother had no title which made her an inappropriate woman for my son, your father. -But I realized that I was ... Full-donkey? That's not exactly the word I was looking for. -Did you change your mind. Yes, and it might as well recent influenza infection. -You mean, when you almost died. -For a while I had a narrow escape. No, but I'm with you. After all, we are a family. What do you think? It depends on how we are you going to make up for those years. -What is going on here? -Just for Mr. Milo join television. Milo, I can be with you for a moment? -Your punishment was no TV. Yeah, but that was before you made me spend Christmas at the Castle with naburelm grandpa. -I did it! It works! Thank you, Floyd. -Now you can disconnect it. -Very well. What? Much not missing, nechytme here or HBO. It bothers me, as I keep saying, what to do. You're not my mom! Not even close. You're right. I'm not. But I'm trying with all my strength. Also, I really miss, you know! Both of you. -It will get better, Milo, I promise. -I'm tired, I'm going to sleep. Well, rest and I'll see you in the morning. I go to bed, Borucki? -Have you prayed? Not yet. Lord, bless mommy and daddy in heaven and Jules and Mila too. The only thing I wish is that grandfather stopped being so annoying and we could all be happy and merry Christmas. Amen! Honey, I know it's not the grandfather, what you wish but it is important that with people give up. -He was not too happy when her mother and dad got married, right? - No, it was not. But you know, they loved him anyway. Maybe it's time we also forgive him. So they come to us angry, we're here? No, they would be happy. For your grandfather was a big step when you and your brother invited to Castlebury. -All right. -This is my girl. And, Jules, do you think Santa will find us, even if we have tree and lights? Do not worry, Santa knows where are all good kids. Sleep tight. -You pord hunting tomorrow?! -It's a tradition, remember? -I thought it pleases you. This well-pleased. I do not want my band hunters roamed the castle. Father, they are all friends. And it's too late to put it aside. What's wrong with you? I thought you merry family Christmas. I changed my mind. Christmas makes me think of Charles. -And the kids too. -It's obvious! And what did you expect? I do not know. Perhaps the I'll feel better. So your new plan is to make all feel terrible? I do not have a plan! -Yes? -I'm sorry to bother you, I just ... -I could never in a castle Find your Christmas tree. -That's because there is none. -And why not? -I do not like them. Leave a mess everywhere and green prickly litter gets everywhere. -Father. -But the children it will be! -I do not want to! -And you tell me, please, what do you want? -According to me know. -Of course I do. I want to know why you had to bring the kids here, when they do not want to make a nice Christmas. I'm not talking about Christmas in a castle where everyone walks like a zombie .. I mean Merry Christmas bells and big dirty tree, with lots of lights to Santa knows where we are. -The kids had a really tough year. -So do we! Then we all deserve Happy Merry Christmas, eh? -Maybe you could even consider the tree. -It does not! And if you do not like that, you go back to Geneva. I do not understand why you ever returning home. Because I'm your son. Maybe not your favorite, but certainly the only living.

Go back and raise the bow, please. Put it on th side. Fingers like that. And breathe. Look at the target. On the eye can see better? -On the right. -Then look through it. When I was your age, I used too frequently monocles. It's hard to know how to fight, I later gave up .. How so? Nunesl strikes you? On the contrary. Even though I won, I still felt like a bum .. Now stretched bow. And let arrow, let me walk away with your anger. -Super. -Even Jenda? -Good morning, sir. -Good morning, Paisley. It's funny how decorating the Christmas tree can induce the Christmas atmosphere. -Paisley, how many days are left until Christmas? -Five, sir. Five ... It will be hard work, but I think invitations that can be ready in time to divorce. -Invitations? -Yes, to the ball. We will be throwing the ball? Yes, it will be at our Christmas Ball, I just decided. We need to hire a band. And tell Ashton let invite all your friends. -Are you all right, sir. -Never been better. -What do kids? Mila-Asthon learn to shoot a bow Maddie and Miss Abigail Jules and run looking after the castle and head dolls Dingle. Sorry, I should have the head sew tighter. -Your? -Thank you. Look at this! Whoa! This is a tragedy! -Are you sure do not want a new one? -Sun In that case, put on your best people, who will not stop until they find the head! Come on, Maddie, we a tea party. I saw you in the morning and Milo on the terrace. It is very nice of you, that you spend time with him. So if you too worried. The hour went surprisingly well. -And you're next. -With arms on it I'm not very good. And what about the waltz? You'll need the ball, which his father holds. -Really? -Yes. It appears that it is thought thanks to someone. Shall We Dance? -You're too stiff. -I just wanted to say the same thing about you. Allow your hand. And how should it then be? -Sensitively. Much better. Now counting. One, two, three. One, two, three. I'm sorry, I'm not just musically talented. Do not worry, I am. From five I learned the violin. -Do you play the violin? -Yes. -And now, try to concentrate. -I just think it's interesting. It seems to me interesting that you eat wings and you know the art from Christopher Landry. Children, I thought, that since you both Hauntigtni, I should expand your cultural education. Can this obligation addressed until after the holidays? You will be able to choose between language, literature, music, dance or art. I chose ballet. -What did you choose? -Electric guitar. -This is impossible. -Come on, lighten up a bit. -I'm just funky type. -Do not worry, I am. Basic lessons with YMCA. Oh come on, I know you're a prince, but certainly you sometimes hidden dance moves. I'm sorry to bother you this ... your ghetto dance -But we have to ... -Lunch ... with your parents! Excuse us. -I'm really sorry. -For'll forgive you this time. Now you should have around a lot of distractions. You know, Ashton, I think it's great both to those children dedicate. Really. Finally, we use it here, huh? Yes, but their life is Buffalo and soon will go home. Of course it is occasionally see ... on oprzdninch or graduation. But we must be realistic, not like us. It would be wrong to force is to change it. Change it? Sorry to interrupt, but we have less of a problem with canaps to the ball. -What's the problem? -Chef can not decide between shrimp quiche and salmon mousse. I would prefer salmon. Although caviar would be even better. So salmon? Or something else? Maybe I should come back later. Speaking of tomorrow evening I have the most beautiful dress. Come walk me to my car. -Which dress is Miss Jules tomorrow, Mrs. Birch. -I suppose it will be these. -This is the robe away. -Maybe it helps when it vyehlme ... -What is the guest list? -Good. Nearly all accepted the invitation. That is fine. Yes, you're right. You should not have happened to be at lunch Arabellinmi with parents? Badly-I looked at the clock and missed it. -That's a very irresponsible. Family du Belmond is in this highly esteemed county, We did not want to squander it, did it? Believe me, Dad, it was not intentional. Very well, then. I noticed that you spend much time with Jules. I taught her about the dance waltz. We invite her? Let me guess, you want there ij just because it does not have a title. If only it, but behaves also quite obscene. I suppose it will not not invite? Exactly so. We only hope avoiding trapasum. Hello. The clock did not work for years. Only had to pull a little shaver. They would have had to go right. You are amazing! You need to go bake Christmas cookies, I promised the kids. They taste great. -She is Miss Jules. Cute-girl. -What could compel him to play again? -I asked rather WHO. -What is it, Floyd? -Sorry to interrupt, sir. But I found it! I think you're looking for this. Thank you, Maddie will be thrilled. -Are you okay? -Just give me something in my eye. -I'm fine. -Of course. -Did you want something else? -Yes. I wanted to ask. We have a problem with the selection jednohubkek. -What's the problem? -Shrimp quiche or salmon mousse? -What do you like most? -Shrimp quiche. That's it. -Do you like shrimp? -Very much. Then it is solved. Good night. Charles was of best. Your father. Much better than I when I could be. -Why was locked in his room? -Probably because ... it hurts too much to remember. But this is everything from my father left. All of this makes him a living. Why no one remembers? Every morning when I wake up, the I'm trying to remember, but ... But his face out of my mind disappears more and more. And for a while, until I try, was left with no bit. That's not true. The love you for you he will always be here. You look just like him. -Really? -A lot. Milo, I'm so glad that you and Maddie and Jules arrived for Christmas. I hope you noticed how all elevated Christmas spirit. Should I leave the door from now unlocked? Come on, it's too late and tomorrow is the big day. Coming. -Sorry I woke you? -Is everything okay? -Not been some incident. -Incident? I'm terribly sorry, Miss, did not realize I think the iron is too hot. Nothing happens, Abigail ... But this is, after all, Miss Jules Now what does not go to prom. What's that burning? -For God's sake, call it a hole! -Thanks, Paisley, for your valuable observations. What will you do? All shops the clothes were shut down. You'll have to repair, nothing else can do. -Maybe it's a sign. -What do you think? -That I would not go to the ball. -You can not be serious. Miss Daly, were it not for you, supplier no ball would not happen. It's nice of you to say so, but I think miss him. Into the seat. We have to do something. I have an idea. I must say that the tailor did a great job, sir. Even if you only had one exam .. Paisley, I have a feeling that tonight will be fantastic. Crystal glasses in the hall.

Floyd, sit forward. Sure, those on It hit the power, Jules has to catch the ball. Oh my God! She was editor of the French Vougue, who spoke the Countess Lillehookovou? I do not know. Arabella, do you that belong together? What kind of stupid question. We are the perfect couple. All that said, even our parents think so. -And what if I did not have a title? -What the hell is this nonsense! -You did not answer my question. -Because it's a stupid question. Well, if you were to be a gardener, I would not even look at you without looking. -Is that what you wanted to hear? -Yes. Why? -Because it's true. We do not want the same things. My life to yours does not fit. You're breaking up with me? No, of course not, we all expect to espouse. Sorry, but I'm not sure that I can make you happy. But I want to be happy.

Father talked about Bunny McCracken. -Who? -It's a horrible woman, something in grizzlies style. Scaring children ... and elderly. Yonder stands. Yeah, you're right, Not that the grizzly ... Jules, you must know, no maybe you do not know, but ... The truth is that I care too much about you. I clamped one that you have no title. You're really funny, smart and surprisingly unconventional, which is a rare combination I think they are playing our song. -But we have a song? -Now we already have. How come dancing with her? -Do something! Where's Edward? What are you so upset? I suggest you get more watch your son. -I do not know what you're talking about. -About that. -Are you okay? -Yes, just need some air. Of course. Jules, wait! You should go back inside, I'm sure that you are looking for you. I'll stay a while. No, I'll wait here with you. If you do not mind. -But what Arabella? -I finished it. -What happened? -You hit my heart. And how do I do it? -You're a prince and I Castlebury just a poor girl from Buffalo. -Exactly. Such an insult! Prince Ashton There publicly cavort with that girl. -When should engage with our daughter. -My son can decide for themselves Yes, we know about your sons and their weakness for women without a title. Watch your tongue, woman! I'm top Baroness Belmondo and you can not address me like that! You may Baroness, But Jules Daly is larger lady than what you ever will. You obviously do not know the right Jules Daly. It had just about money, why else would there be. Everyone sees the kids can not cope at all. So I did small personal exploration. Did you know that Jules Daly thrown out of work? That Mr. Milo is actually kleptomaniak? And that little Maddie is changing the addict to food? -That's a lie! No, Arabella's right. See? I said it. Milo really stole the game, but then it went back. Maddie loves chips, which we are trying to alleviate. And I really currently unemployed, but I hope it will not last long because I work like that. Maybe too much about parenthood do not know but I know that we do not need money, we were happy. We just need yourself. They are brave children who deserves to have a family. Even if you do, Arabella, seem to be impossible, that's the only reason why we are here. Ashton, perhaps it really believe that. Yes, I do. -Edward, surely you can see, it is ... -And if so what? Say about Jules is poor mother. I was also a bad father. And worse father-in-law. Jules should at least work while you worked a single day in his life. And if you ask me, Arabella Marchand du Belmont, You're here because coats and necklaces. That's enough, we're leaving! Come on, Thomas! Thanks, Dad! No, thank you, you did not give up the old fool. Can I donate one fatherly advice? Do not let the girl escape. -Can I talk to your aunt for a moment to talk? -Definitely. Jules, I know that there are no hockey and chicken wings, but we have cricket and pancakes. Is it possible that you would get with Maddie Milo and extend your stay? Here at Castlebury Hall? -Jules has a beautiful dress. -Yes, sir. -Great taste! -I thought about where bought? If you would like to replace your expenses, submit my bill in the morning. So back to work. Thank you, sir. -You are a good man, Paisley. It's time! Children! Santa! You see, Maddie, wrong I. Santa exists. Come on, kids! Hello, Santa! -Look at all the presents! -Do you see the big gold?! Where did you come from all those gifts? -You are really great! No, my dear, you're amazing! -What is it, Dad? -I just wish that there was Charles. But he's here. Did not see it Mila in bright eyes? Or a beautiful smile Maddie? Charles is here. And my sister too. You're right, dear. And Ashton, this is a really smart girl. We should not cry over what we have lost, but celebrating what we found. -Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas! -Look! -Fireworks! This must-see. Merry Christmas! Jules and Ashton, all the best! Hi, my prince! Hi, my princess! -It sounds like we're in line for a throne. -The problem is that we really are. Oh yeah! Really? Here we go! All the stories do not end well. But for Jules Daly, dreamer of Buffalo, this story is just beginning.
