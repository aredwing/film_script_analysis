Go fuck yourself. Harold's Incorporated. Thana, I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm concerned about you. You insist that you're feeling better, but still your work these past few days has not been up to par. On top of scorching the silk blouse, you sewed only 2 cuff buttons instead of 3 on all the Prince suits. I had to do have them all recalled. Darling, I realize that you are working under a tremendous handicap. Which is precisely why you have to try harder that a normal person. You know we all love you here. You know we all want you to do well. So promise me you'll get back on the track. Show more interest in your work. More spirit. Be like the other girls. There's the Halloween party on the 31st. All of us are going. You should come too. There'll be boys your own age. You'll enjoy yourself. You'll have fun. Good. I believe you will. Now tell Laurie to come in here for a minute, please. Now? Okay, I'll be right there. Look, I'll get back to you in about fifteen minutes. Thana, come here. Why did Albert want to see you in his office? Is he upset? What's wrong? Can I have the ashtray? Thank you. Don't you like your sandwich? It's terrible. You know, I don't know why we keep coming to this place? I don't either. We barely have time for coffee now. Hey Mrs. Onassis? What about the coffee we ordered? I'll give it to you right now. No skip the coffee. Just give us the check. We have to go back to work. Okay, you want separate? Just put it on one, what do we look like, strangers over here? What is this, a zoo? They look like a couple of monkeys going at it! Hey lady, we're trying to eat over here! This is a restaurant, it's not Plato's Retreat. Bye. See you later. Here, let me make sure Madame Currie didn't make any mistakes over here. Ok, it's $3.50 a piece, it's $4 with a tip. Everybody put up 4 dollars Hey, ladies. May I join you for an after dinner drink? Sweet ladies. I'm buying. Fuck off! You heard me. Get fucked! Get bent! Fucking wimp. Get the hell out of here. Okay alright. Beat it! Take it easy! Take it easy, my ass! Believe it or not, this guy? Here you go. I can't believe how much work we've got to get done. Yeah I know, I have to go to the bank. I hope we have a long run. Okay, we gotta go. I'll cash my check. Hey listen Thana, we'll see you later at the office, alright? Listen, baby. How you doing? Uh look, I didn't mean to seem forward or out of place in that restaurant or anything. It's no reason for your assistant to get carried away like that. I just wanted to say hello and introduce myself. Rich Falk, fashion photographer. You know, Vogue, Cosmo, layout of Atlanta, and now Belinda on zebra skins, the plaza fountain. You know my stuff. It's been all over. Hey, wait a minute. Just a second, I just want to talk to ya. See, I'm a photographer, I'm a gourmet of beauty, and when I saw you at that restaurant, and that light, I said to myself, wow! I mean, it was like a Renoir or a Matisse. And that's why I wanted to talk to you. No other reason. When I see beauty, I gotta go after it. You're not a model, right? No, you're much too beautiful to be a model. Much too beautiful to be a model. Listen, what do you say? My studio is right around the corner. Nobody is gonna be there, it's Friday. We'll take a test. We'll smoke a little pot. Big pot. A little wine, and we'll try and go for a roll of shots. No big deal. You got nothing to lose. I knew you were a smart kid the minute I saw you. It's no sense being shy with a face like that. Trust me. I'm going to make it work for you. Show you how to make the big bucks. Okay. Here. It's my place here. Come on. Wait til you see this place. You're not going to believe it, it's beautiful. Right in here. And there. Okay, just hold on a second. Okay! This is the place. Come on, you are gonna love it. Wait til you see. Didn't I tell you to trust me. I mean, isn't this a beautiful place? Oh Mrs. Soney, I'm sorry. It won't happen again. But like I had it in my pocket and I changed my pants. Oh Mickey, you're hopeless. You're always losing your keys! It's not my fault. The same story. What's all that makeup? Good Heavens! I've never seen you look like that. Your eyes. And your lips are so heavily made up. ''Staying overnight with a friend.'' What friend? I'm tired of you playing your little game. You understand? Now I want the rest of my money. Well, I don't have any money. I gave you $50, didn't I? You sure you ain't got 50 more? How much do you think he gonna give me. You sure you ain't got 50 more? 5 minutes we were in there. He much do you think he gonna give me? And besides baby. You know I wouldn't hold out on you. Listen baby, that last trick you had was a setup. Now I gave him 100 dollars. You gonna give me 50. I don't care how much you gave him, but he gave me 50 dollars. You calling my friend a liar? Yeah! What? You call my friend a liar? I swear he gave me 50 dollars! Stop hitting me no more! My money! Hunter. Pick her up. Perhaps I can give you a lift somewhere. Are you going anywhere particular? Then perhaps you like to come with me tonight. Here, with the news. Police are still mystified by two apparently unconnected multiple murders that took place in midtown Manhattan last night and the largest mass killing in New York City in 8 years. At the fountain in Central Park all the victims have been shot with a .45 caliber pistol. Meanwhile, at 48th Street and Park Avenue, a wealthy Saudi Arabian businessman Sheikh Mohammed Al Fazal was shot to death almost Oh, it's Thana! Come on in. Oh, you brought something for Phil? Here, Phil. Look what Thana brought you. Since the Sheikh was found carrying more than $2800 in cash. Police are continuing both investigations. Talks will resume this morning between the sanitation workers of the city hoping to head off a strike now scheduled to begin at 12:01 AM There she goes again, Phil. Hey, you going out or what? But, just not coming back to work from lunch on Friday. I mean, how could you do that? It's just not fair to the other girls. On top of having to finish your work for you, before they could go home, they were worried sick. You could of at least gotten word back to us somehow had Mrs. Nasony called. Thana, darling... You promised the other day. Remember? You would try. And look what happened. And now I hear from the other girls that you're not coming with us to the Halloween party. Well from this, all I can Now, this is good news. Do you know where it is? Are you planning on going with someone? Would you like to go with me? I don't believe it. Have you've ever seen her before? Yes, I've seen her in there. Look, that's her office. And that, I guess, that's her boss. That's her boss? Oh god! I don't believe it. If I ever run into him, I wouldn't know what to say! Albert, you gotta come and look at this! I'll make a bet of 20... Here, the second window. Can you believe it? Albert, why don't you try... You know, I see this guy downstairs. What are you gonna say to him next time you see him. Go get some curtains. She's riding him like a whale over there. I don't believe it. The lamps are shaking. They should get a stroller. Don't know why they wanna persecute me because I don't talk to women? All women do is laugh and sing and say the word ''pussy''. You ask any doctor and he'll tell you that. I don't know what's wrong with these people. Well, I'll get these things going after a while. I just will. I gotta get back to work now. You know, really. I don't think it's possible to find a a woman as good as she was. We made love in the bedroom. It'd start out in the bedroom, but we end up in the living room. And when it started out in the living room, we'd end up in the bathroom. We made love all over the house. You never could tell what was gonna happen and it was fantastic. We got along great and all of a sudden, she starts getting antsy. She's got too much time on her hands and she was freaking out. She wants to do something. She wants to get a job and I said: "Hey, wait a minute. A wife of mine isn't working. Okay?" She fought back so finally I gave in and I said: "Alright, get yourself a part-time job, get yourself a full time job. Get a job and do something.'' And she did that and everything was back to normal. Well, sort of. The meals weren't as good. The sex wasn't as good. But it was better than when she was freaking out. You know, I'm a salesman. A shoe salesman. You know, I do a lot of work upstate. You know, upstate. Massachusetts. General wind in that area. You don't want to go to town 2 to 3 days at a time. Once every 2 weeks, 3 weeks. And I started calling her, like 3 o'clock in the morning. She's not home. 9 o'clock at night, she's not home. 9 o'clock in the morning, she's not home. I wondered what the hell is going on here. A lot of things are crossing my mind, but I'm blank and I'm not and I'm trying to say well, she may be over at her mother's house, over at sister's place, out at a movie, or going to the bazzan, or something like that. Anyway, when I start thinking about this cheating stuff, I can't get it out of my mind, man. And all of a sudden, I'm trying to imagine these guys she's cheating with. Who's she cheating me with? A lawyer? A banker? You know, a cop? I was fed up. I had to find out. So I told her I was working late one night, real late. And I hid across the street in an alley behind some garbage cans. She walked down the street a couple of blocks and went into a building, you know brown stone. I went up and I checked out the buzzers and there were 4 names up there and I didn't recognize none of them. So I tried the door and it was locked. Tried to force it, but it wouldn't give. I tried the side door, the one that they bring the garbage out in. It was open. I went in the back. Dark window. I looked in and there's candlelight and I saw her with her arms around another woman. When I got back to our place, I went to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, and washed my face. Then I went into the bedroom and changed my shirt. Then I went out into the kitchen and I strangled her cat. What is this, some kind of joke? Thana, are you there? This place is turning upside down! Phil, what do you got there? It's locked. You wait here and I'm gonna go get the key, and I'll be right back. Phil, look what you've done! You naughty dog! Phil, now she'll know that we were here. Now ladies, I want to make a little announcement. I know all of us have been working very hard this week. What's so funny about that? And you're looking forward to the party this evening. So, courtesy of Harold I'm giving you the afternoon off. So there are two eggs and they are boiling in a pot, and one egg says to the other, "How do they expect us to get hard in 3 minutes? after we just got laid!'' Oh, but you haven't walked him in such a long time. Well.. Hey lady, what are you trying to do with that dog? Not a hell of a lot, but did you see the couple of the evening? It's the Count. Hello, Bobby. And Sister? Thana. A charming name, is that Greek? It's Greek to you, Bob. Tommy, you gotta go to Puerto Rico. The spanish girls, bam. 300 dollars, you can get a virgin. They got this shit coming in from the other islands. What the hell is 300 dollars? But, you promised after we had Laurie, that you'd get a vasectomy. I changed my mind. Hi Albert! How are my little brownies? My little workers, How are you doing? You've been drinking. Un Poquito. Excuse me, you hair will turn to silver. Albert! How are you? You know Miss Benson. Of course. Sure. Albert, who's that girl you are with tonight? She's one of my proteges. It's unfair! It's goddamn unfair! You shut up! We are not gonna have this discussion here. These are business associates of mine. Thana, is that you, Thana? But, Ms. LaSoney, I didn't mean to scare you? You almost gave me a heart attack, with that idiot costume! Oh, that girl! That witch! Oh I know, I know, I know. Oh baby, oh sweetheart. The Mount of Venus. I think she's at a party with friends. She's a witch. I know she killed my Phil! Phil? My Phil, yes, my dog. Check that office for legwork cause somebody must know where they went. Yeah, she's a horror. You got to find her. Oh, Mickey... And you, better get rid of that head. Oh my God, it came from up there! Fucking Thana!
