Here are their hardships, their humour and, above all, their heroism. The unconquerable heroism of men who take heroism for granted, as part of their daily lives. Neither plaster saints or romantic rebels, they live lives far from the limelight, without publicity and with no spokesman, save when some great crisis or disaster lifts them into the headlines. Yet these people are the backbone of nations, the stuff of human destiny. Simple working people such as there are the world over, in all countries and at all times. Fenwick, do the men work tomorrow? - Not on Scupper Flats, Mr Barras. - Against your union? The union isn't being asked to work there. There's a million tons of floodwater ready to wash down on us. You don't think I'd chance flooding my own mine? Show us the plans of the workings, then. - No plans never existed. - There's two opinions on that. It's you who've put the wind up the men. - And the union should be backing us up. - Davey. This your lad who's after the university scholarship? I'd like to help him. The men won't work Scupper Flats. The unions made the drill test. We wouldn't send you down if it wasn't safe. 30 years in this pit, Bob, and you do this. We all think Bob Fenwick's right! We're with Fenwick! - Nobody needs to go against the union. - Better than being drowned! - Know what you can do with the union. - Make him show us the plans. Show us plans. - It isn't dangerous, is it, Father? - I'll teach them a lesson. I hear them sound their trumpets. First, angel sounds, then follows hail mingled with blood. The angel sounds a great mountain burning with fire cast into the sea. The third part of the sea becomes blood. Not water, my brethren, but blood. 'Tis not water that has brought us here, but blood. I hear them sound their trumpets. The first angel sounds and then follows hail mingled with blood. Morning, Mother. Hello, Nicky. I got nothing for you today, Mrs Fenwick. - You thought I'd have a bit left over, eh? - Bit of lights, maybe. I've nought for you, Martha, nor your good-for-nothing family. No woman's ever had better sons than mine, nor better man neither. Maybe an empty belly will make him think twice before calling a strike. - He had good reasons. - Aye! A clever chap! Bringing misery on the whole town. You go back and tell him. I'll have no begging around my shop. Keep these doors shut. I've had enough of these cadgers mooching round. Sitting up all night, stuffing your head with the high-faluting rubbish. You and your scholarships. (RASPING COUGH) That'll do, lad. If you don't know enough now to pass that scholarship, 12 hours won't help. Why don't you go for a walk up the field? - Hughie! - What is it, Mother? - Breakfast. - Breakfast? Did you say breakfast? That's what I call a feed. Oysters, pickle. Pity I'm not hungry. I'll just have a piece of that bread. I don't like that kind of fun. Tha shouldn't mock good food. You're lucky to get anything with your father clever like he is. Isn't every man who can scare miners about a bit of water, get them to strike against the unions. Thank you. My father wasn't so clever, nor my grandfather. They was just men. Master Pit commanded, men obeyed. They were daft enough to think of their own families. Your father's cleverer than that, Hughie. He can see through solid coal to the floodwater t'other side of it. Mr Barras and the union can't find that for all their instruments. Barras knows it's there. There's plans of them workings. - Taking a chance on it, that's all. - Chance? - If Father says he's seen it, he has. - He's seen it in the bottom of a glass! Plans or no plans, I've been sitting about here for eight weeks and I'm fed up. That's the way I like to hear a man talk. Too many lads nowadays break their necks to get away from pit. At least I've got one son who wants to work with his coat on. She's right. 'Tisn't a coat I want to work in. Not much difference between a coat and a football jersey. Tynecastle United are paying apprentices five quid a week. If he can get away from the pit, I can, and I don't have to read no books. - How then, Davey? - Hello, Joe. - You going tomorrow for examination? - Aye. You're lucky. One of these days you'll see me in Tynecastle too. - What would you do in Tynecastle? - Not listening to college professors. - There's money in Tynecastle, Davey. - Money? Tynecastle's not the spot for that. Morning, Davey, Joe. London's the spot. Georgie Cumming's making 3 a week singing on the street. That's what I'm after. 3 just for singing! What I'm after is big money. You'll need it to pay back all the money you pinch out of my pockets. - Your son's a born capitalist, Slogger. - You bet your life I am. You've got to have money. Ever going to make money in the pit? No. I want big money and I'm going places. You go to college. I'm going to look after myself. You can smile, Davey, but where will high-mindedness get you? Wasting your time fighting for the miners? What an ambition! I'd sooner stay in Scupper Flats. This whippet's running to skin and bone. - I said so at the time. - You gave Bob here the first cheer! - He said so! - Keenest of all to save your skins. - You kidded us about those plans. - I kidded nobody. There are plans of those old workings. I saw them in Barras's office. Nobody's getting me there. I'm not going to drown myself to keep Barras fat. - Get off with you! - I'll pay you back for this! You won't work then you come after charity! If my missus pegs out, I'll slit your throat! I'll put the police onto you! You talk of the police as if you own them! - What is it, Will? - My missus has got pneumonia. - Doctor says she's to have beef tea. - Why shouldn't she? Right. Ramage's have got tons of beef. Just a bit of bone, I says, and I'll pay you the minute the strike's over. - What did he say? - Chased me out with his cleaver. - There's not a woman he's not insulted. - And he's got booze. Dad? We'll tell him what we think of him and get that beef for Will's wife. Come on, lads! Help yourselves. - Hurry or there won't be a thing left... - Where's the booze? How much do you want? Stop it, you fools! This is the worst thing you can do. - Stop it! - My missus is starving! Put that back! You must be daft. Leave that be! The sergeant! - Fenwick! - There's another one in there. - # The heart that never rejoices... # - How are you going? He started it, and his woman's been a nuisance. I saw him egging them on. - I never did nothing. - I bet he didn't either. - Leave him alone. - Come along with me. - You saw it all? - I did. - You'd better come along. - Drinking like that. # Down the mine, the beautiful mine... # I saw a pale horse. His name was Death and Hell followed with him. Another horse was red and power was given to him to take peace from the earth. Another horse that was red and power was given to him to take peace from the earth. - How again, Wept? - Hello, Joe. - I beheld a black horse... - Got one for the Derby? ...he that sat on him held a pair of balances and I looked and beheld a pale horse... (SHOUTING) Three months we've had of it! Good job we've shown some sense or it'd be another three months! Longer! I'm the last man to say owt about Bob Fenwick, but it's got him in jail! We never had no choice! We never had no... You'll get drowned! Just stand out a few more weeks. - A few more weeks? - You said that when it started! Kind of you to sympathise with my father, but you're turning the men against him. If Barras loses the contract for coking coal, we won't have to work Scupper Flats. We're the ones who've got to work coking coal! - You're going to that posh college! - Get back where you belong! And what am I going to do in that college? Educate myself to fight for my own kind! I've worked down there with you. I've got coal dust pitted in my skin! It won't wash out as long as I live! I've seen what it's done to you with your coughs and your silicosis. It's done it to my own father! Mr Barras! (EAGER SHOUTING) - We've got a deputation, Mr Barras. - Shan't be a minute, Arthur. - All right, Father. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, Mr Barras. - Afternoon. - Ah, Fenwick. You got the scholarship? - Aye. - When do you leave? - Today. I'm waiting for my father. Let me know when you finish. I might be able to get you into a council school. - It's not schoolteaching I'm after. - I'd like to see you get on anyway. - You ready? - Yes, Mr Barras. - (CHEERY GREETINGS) - We shan't have any trouble now. Hey, you! Hey, he chose me! He chose me! Three good shirts I'm putting in for you. Send thy washing to a good woman. None of their new-fangled laundries. - Have you got another handkerchief? - Aye, Mother. - Making sure he's all poshed up? - And his pit clothes will be kept posh. Maybe he'll be satisfied with them some day, same as yourself, lad. Hello, Dad! Did you have a good time? Good as a holiday it was. Pity it weren't licensed. Anyone seen owt of our Joe? There's been no sign of him. You off to Tynecastle, Davey? Best of luck, lad. I've got great faith in you. - Thanks, Slogger. - Bye, Martha. None of my family needed no college education. They was good mining stock. Same as I thought your father were before he set himself up against pit. You know they jailed me for nowt. They got their knife into me over the strike. That don't surprise me. And I noticed no one came forward to stand up for thee. It done one good thing - left them free to settle strike. Got it over before I was out, eh? - Aye. How's your cough been, Father? - This cough will never kill me. - I don't want you down Scupper Flats. - Don't worry about that. You've got to think about making your way. You're going to do something about this industry. - The men have great hopes of you, lad. - They don't talk like it. They think it all the same. What time you leaving? - Now you're back, the next train. - I'll come with you. Thank you, Martha. - We'll be getting along, shall we, Davey? - Aye. - So long, Hughie. - Good luck. I'll be in Tynecastle soon. So long. Well, I'm off, Mother. Aye. Don't forget to keep my pit clothes waiting for me. I don't expect thou'll be needing them. - Here... You'll want a bite for the train. - Thank you, Mother. Goodbye, Mother. - Goodbye, Father. - Goodbye. Wilkinson wants 10 each way, but his limit's five. Take it. Is that you, Laura? Is he able to come tonight? - Did you put it to him the way I asked? - It's going to be all right, Joe. That's fine. The place is the Percy Grill. Have you got that? I'll come over to your table. I've got to rush away. I've got to put something off. Of course, if it's something important... Don't be daft, Laura. Since I've been in Tynecastle, I've not looked at another girl. That's it. The cooking doings... The Percy Grill. Ta-ta. Sounds like poetry, doesn't it? - Hello, Joe. Looking for Jenny? - Yes. - When are you two getting married? - Business is a bit busy. Can you tell her I've some business tonight? OK. Joe! - What's the business tonight? - I was just looking for you. Some other girl tonight? Don't be daft. I've never set eyes on another girl. - It can't be business every night. - I get that from your mother. I can't help it. I'd much sooner be with you. - Would you, Joe? - Of course I would. Then let's go out tonight like we used to. We'll go to the Percy Grill. - Percy Grill? - Where we first met. - I wish I hadn't got this business tonight. - Let's start afresh back at the beginning. Joe, you might listen to me. All right, Jenny. I'll put it off. I'll wait outside for you. - Davey! How then? - Joe! - Only one Joe Gowlan in Tynecastle. - Only one Joe Gowlan anywhere! - Did you get that scholarship? - Aye. Where have you been? After that scandal in Ramage's shop and my dad getting pinched, I just had to come away. Sorry. Your dad was mixed up in that, wasn't he? It's all right. What have you been doing? - I'm a turf accountant. - A bookie. I've got bigger fish to fry. You're not in a rush? Come out with me and my lady. - All right. - Fine. She's my landlady's daughter. Here she comes. Davey, this is Miss Sunley. This is Davey Fenwick from the university. - Hello. - How about some snuff? - Shall we pop into Lockhart's? - This is on Joe Gowlan, so you shut up. - What about the...? - Joe? Percy Grill. Come on, Davey. I think I'll have some oysters. Can I leave you for a minute. It's one of my clients. One of the biggest foundry owners. - That's all right, Joe. - Back in a jiffy. - Joe's a card, isn't he? - Yes. - Hello, Mr Millington. - Hello, Gowlan. Anything good? A whisper about Rock Boy for the 3.30. Rock Boy, eh? Laura, I believe you've met Joe Gowlan. We did meet at the Spring Handicap, but I doubt you'll remember. - Of course. Won't you sit down? - Well, I... - Have a drink. - Thank you, Mr Millington. Smart lad. Wasting his time in bookmaking. What was that horse? - Rock Boy, Mr Millington. - Pretty girl, Mr Gowlan. Your fiance? No, you've got the wrong end of the stick. She's with a friend of mine from university. Oh. Stanley, weren't you saying something about Mr Gowlan? I'm sorry. I thought you did. Something about the Carnport works. Yes. Someone was telling me... I forget who. I believe you know something about coal, Gowlan. Nothing except I was born and bred on it. - I need a buyer for my Carnport works. - I wouldn't say no. It may be possible, but don't count on it. - All I need's a start, you see... - I know. You're a smart lad. You see... There's one thing I've got my heart set on. I suppose you'd call it coal. - Coal? - Coal mines. I'm trying to arrange a university debate on the private ownership of coal mines. Of course. A very good thing. No, Miss Sunley. I'm going to speak against it. Naturally, David. I think it would be a very good thing. It's been ever so nice meeting you. You'll be having letters after your name. - That's jumping ahead. - You're the cleverest person I've ever met. - The cleverest you'll ever meet, too. - Is this a mutual admiration society? - But I admire you. - You two are getting on all right. - Put your nose out of joint. - I can't compete to universities. Yes. It's not often I meet anybody as important as you. If the scholarship people thought that, they might raise my allowance! - It's time we were getting along. - Fine. - Do you go near Westgate Road? - I pass it. - We all go the same way home. - We'll meet in the vestibule, then. She's a nice lass, Davey. Aye. I didn't know you had such good taste, Joe. Taste? Me? No. You've got the wrong end of the stick. There's nothing between Jenny and me. Keep the change. I just stay at their place. Between you and me, Davey, you rather swept her off her feet. - Don't be daft. - It's a case of just going in and winning. Joe does it in style - taxi and all. - Joe? Is Jenny all right? - Of course I am, Mother. I thought you must have had an accident... Oh. - This is Mr Fenwick from the university. - Pleased to meet you. Goodness me. And me in this state. It's too bad of you. It's all right. He's as good as one of the family. - Look us up, Davey. - Of course. Goodbye, Davey. Goodnight, Jenny. Goodnight, Mrs Sunley. Goodnight, Joe. - Maybe we could meet again? - Of course. - How about tea sometime? - That'd be fine, Jenny. If you'll excuse me. I've got a headache. I'll mix myself a powder. Goodnight. Goodnight. What about tomorrow? After five? - Let me see... - I can call for you just after five. - All right, then. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Jenny. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Jenny! Here a minute. You're not treating Joe right. He went to bed upset. If you didn't notice it, you're blind. - Was he jealous? - He was. It's no good to treat a man like that. There were tears in his eyes. I know what I'm doing. It's time I taught him a lesson. I tried to teach someone a lesson and it ended with me marrying your father. I could marry Joe Gowlan tomorrow just by raising my little finger. But I'm not going to raise it. Not just yet. (LAUGHTER) (DAVEY) The case for private ownership varies according to what it is. (MAN) The case for public ownership varies according to who puts it. (DAVEY) I'll put it this way. If private ownership of coal mines, why not lighthouses? Because there's no profit in a lighthouse. Please, it's taken... I don't believe that everything under the sun should be publicly owned, but coal mining is not something under the sun. - Hear hear! - That's not my point, Mr Nugent. There's a fundamental difference between coal mining and most industries. It is that coal, like iron and other natural resources, was not invented, manufactured or even cultivated by man, it is put there by nature for man to take. These natural resources, ladies and gentlemen - national resources - are not the basis of a few industries, incidental to our nation's structure. They are the basis of all our industry. The life blood of every industry. They are the very foundation upon which our nation is built. The material with which our nation is built, without which our nation could not flourish. I resent that this great buried treasure, this source of all our nation's wealth, this vital national heritage, should be dispensed to this man or that, good man or bad, to exploit this mine or that, willy nilly, as and when he chooses. To use it as a pawn in price manipulations, cost evasions, middleman transactions and as a pabulum of his self-aggrandisement. I resent it as I would resent a foreign flag on the cliffs of Dover. (APPLAUSE) - Favourite won the 2.30, Joe. - Business is as good as yours now. - You got that job, then? - You bet I did. You know where to find me, but don't tell Jenny. I want to get away before she comes home. So long. Hope you make your fortune. So long, Joe. - Jenny! - Davey. I thought you were ever so nice. - Did you...? - Where's Joe? He said he'd be here. He said he'd be at Jesmond Dene and at the picnic. - Maybe he thinks we like being alone. - That's it. - Well done, Fenwick. - Thanks. Do you have any ambition for politics? The subjects I'm studying most are political science and economy, and I read your speeches. - He's talking shop. - Sorry. Miss Sunley, Mr Nugent. Come and see me. I might be able to push you on. - Would you? - Get your degree first. - I will. - A Member of Parliament! One of the best. Did you hear what he said? He was ever so taken with you. I must be off. Goodbye. - If you wait, I'll see you home. - I can't. I'm ever so late. Bye. - I didn't know you were in, Joe. - Hello, Mrs Sunley. What's this, Joe? I knew it. I told her you'd never stand it. - She was treating you shocking. - Worse than shocking. I... I just got an anonymous letter about it. Broke my heart. It's a disgrace! It's better you shouldn't see it. She's out again with him today. - Have a talk with her. - No. I've suffered enough. He's my best friend. It's more than flesh and blood can stand. I'd never have thought it of Davey Fenwick. I only hope his intentions are honourable. - I'll tell her a thing or two! - I'd sooner you didn't say anything to her. I bear her no ill-will. I just want her to be happy. She's a bad heartless girl. For two years she's been your intended, and now you're not grand enough! I just want to be by myself, Mrs Sunley. I know how you feel, Joe. I'll make a nice cup of tea for you. That's kind of you. - Is Joe in, Mother? - Aye, but only just. - What do you mean? - I'll tell you what I mean. - Joe Gowlan is packing! - Packing? I told you no man would put up with the way you were going. You've lost him. You weren't so clever after all. See where it's got you? You've lost the best man that ever drew breath. Joe! Joe... He's gone, has he? - I told you so. - Don't, Mother. You'll never get another like him if you get one at all! - Oh, Mother! - You don't grow younger, you know. There aren't thousands of young men waiting for you. Raising your little finger? You left it a bit late this time. That's what you'll do for the rest of your life - be too late. You don't find fellows like Joe Gowlan every day. Mark my words! You'll finish up like your Aunt Lily, an old maid! Jenny. - What's wrong? - Don't let's talk about it. - Don't talk about it. - Sit down. Let me take that. - What is it, Jenny? - Mother. She's been on at me all the time. - It's not my fault Joe Gowlan left. - Joe left? I couldn't stand him, David. I couldn't stand him! - I don't follow, Jenny. - I didn't know he was mad about me. - Mad about you? He told me himself... - That's what she says. - I never encouraged him. - Of course you didn't. But he left because... Because he found out that... I liked you more than him. I can't help it if I love you. She can't blame me, can she? - You love me? - I can't help it, can I? Jenny. And you love me too. Don't you, David? From the first minute I saw you. I want us to be together always. I can't go back there. I want us to be married and happy. - I'll take you away the minute I can. - Oh, David. The minute I get my degree and get a post. But that's another whole year. We couldn't wait that long. Couldn't you get a post now? - It's not long. - You could be a schoolmaster. - But I don't... - You could take that post in Sleescale. - Jenny... - We could have a lovely home. You could study in the evening with me beside you. I can't throw away my scholarship and the university. We must be practical. But I am. I've got it all worked out. You can get good furniture on the never-never. - Never-never. - About half a crown a week. - There'll be cheap houses in Sleescale. - Cheap? That's not the point, Jenny. I'd feel I was letting everybody down. - My father, the men. - Say no more about it, David. Mr Nugent would drop me if I threw everything away. Not another word. Just tell me you love me. More than anything in the world, Jenny. (LAUGHTER) There's a good way to remember this. Watch. (LAUGHTER) - What's that? - A pit pony. That's right. A pit pony. That's the way to remember Scandinavia. Kicking his legs up during a strike. If you want to remember Stockholm, it's there on the pony's hoof. Oslo is there on the pony's Adam's apple. It's closing time. Go along home. Good afternoon. (BOYS) Afternoon, sir. Pat? Patrick. This is your last day, Pat. - Aye. - Did you tell you mother what I said? Aye. She said I had enough education for hewing coal. I'll come down with you. - Fenwick. - Yes, sir? Wait for me a bit, Pat. I understand Mr Barras asked you to coach his son in the evening and you refused. Evenings are when I study for my degree, Mr Strother. Pity you didn't think of that before. You'd have had your degree by now. - You wished to see me? - Yes. We're getting laughter in your class again. Education is a serious matter. - A child depends on it. - But an article on modern education... I knew about modern education before you were born. Its basis is to have teachers with degrees. We may keep you to oblige Mr Barras, but you must be sensitive of your limitations. I'm sorry, Mr Strother. Another thing. Scandinavia is not a horse. Let me refer you to Gray's Geographical Compendium for pupil-teachers, page 173. You will find this. "The shape of Scandinavia may be likened to a bear." A bear, Mr Fenwick. A bear. But these boys have never seen a bear. Precisely. We teach them two things at the same moment - the shape of Scandinavia and the shape of a bear. - You may go, Fenwick. - Thank you, sir. I hear you've got track of your Joe. Aye. He's in Tynecastle. I ran over and dropped in on him. Thought I might touch him for a quid, but he nearly touched me. Hey, look. Second time he's been down this month. A lot of water here. The men don't worry about the damp - they work in worse - but they think it's coming from the old workings. We've worked far enough here. Move them along next shift. As you wish, Mr Barras. I'm not nagging at you, but you've got too good a brain to throw it away. You've got no right to go down the pit, you can be more use. What's wrong with the pit? It's a man's job. I thought that when I was leaving school... - Davey! - Hello, Hughie. - Did you see the match? - It was grand. My name will be seen in the "Tynecastle Chronicle". Of course. When are you coming over? Jenny hasn't seen you for months. I've got to put in a lot of training. Sorry. Remember me to Jenny! See what our Hughie thinks about pit work. He's mad about football. - Somebody's got to go down pit. - Yes, I know... - Mrs Reedy, I was hoping... - Don't Mrs Reedy me! I know the blather you're stuffing into his head. Where's education got you? 45 bob a week. Well, Mr Smarty, our Pat will be fetching as much as that and no mucking about before he does it! Such a lot you were going to do for the men! Going into Parliament! How then, Mother? - How's thyself, lad? - Father in? - He'll be back in a minute. - Come in. You can wait for him. - I'd better be getting along. - Jenny's got veal and ham pie waiting. - Please thyself, lad. Mother, I wish you'd give Jenny a chance. - You haven't been to see her. - Does she want me to see her? You don't give her a chance. She's lonely. She wants cheering up. Wants cheering up, does she? Lonely? Why should a woman be lonely with a man of her own to look after? I should be lonely if I thought of nothing but gadding about. (CAT MEWS) All right, Mother. - Hello, Davey. Come in. - Jenny's expecting me. I'd better... - How's she getting along? - Not so bad. - I'd like to have a talk sometime. - Yes. - How's things at Scupper Flats? - Barras has nearly finished that contract. If it's lasted three years, it should last three more weeks. I heard you'd soon be getting out of it. I must be off. So long. - So long, Mother. - So long, Davey. Hello, Jenny. - What's wrong today? - Nothing's wrong. Nothing at all. I wish you wouldn't eat with your fingers. I have such a wonderful life. No maid, all the lovely housework to do. Not even a wireless to annoy me in the evening. If I asked you to take me to Tynecastle tonight, you'd be insulted. Nothing's wrong. We've been going out too many evenings - even if we could afford it. You might say excuse me when you leave the table. Afford it?! You turned down Barras's offer of giving his son tuition! I can't even call my furniture my own with the never-never man pestering me. I even had to pay for the honeymoon. You'd make me so happy if you'd take me out just this once. Do be sensible. I want to finish this book tonight. You want?! It doesn't matter what I want! You brought me to a place where there's not a soul to talk to! - Try to be friendly with my people... - Your people indeed! - Your father was a jailbird. - Jenny... I know all about it. Robbed a shop. Nice father-in-law for a... Jenny. David, it was wicked of me. - I shouldn't have done that. - But I deserved it. I'm a bad heartless girl. I'm just a drag on you. - Your nerves are on edge, that's all. - Yes. That's it. I need cheering up. - Yes. - If only for your sake. We can go to the Percy Grill, where we first met. We can forget our squabbles and start afresh. Yes. Maybe you're right, Jenny. Run and get ready. You're so sweet to me. We can just catch the 5.20. - I'll be down in a minute. - (KNOCKING) That's the laundry. You see them. They tried to charge me nine pence too much. - How then, son? - Mother! - Come in, come in. - She's brought some home-made broth. That's fine. Come on in. That's the kitchen. Here's the drawing room. - Drawing room? - It's grand, isn't it? Is Jenny tidying up the kitchen? She thought you were the laundry. They tried to swindle her out of ninepence. Laundry? That never gets a chance to swindle me. Sit down, Mother. Here's a fine chair. - Tea in the parlour? - Once in a while. Shop cake. I'll get you a drop of port. It'll cheer you up. We don't want to interfere with your studies. - It isn't often we get a chance for a talk. - No. Here she is. How's that for a quick...? Visitors for you, Jenny. How are you, lass? This is a great pleasure. What a shame we're just going out. But, Jenny... We promised some friends to meet them in Tynecastle. How pretty. - Jenny, we don't have to... - No. We couldn't have stopped long. - Of course. You can easily come again. - Yes, lass. You can still have a drop of port, Mother. I don't know why you think I've taken to drink. The lad's just trying to be pleasant. David, hurry. We'll be late for the train. - What you doing, David? - Coming. - Come and see us soon. - Best send a postcard first. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Davey. At least one son's not breaking his neck to leave pit. (ENCOURAGING CHEERS) Hughie, pick it up and run wi' it! Grand game Hughie's playing. - Mr Fenwick! - Yes, Denny. - Mr Strother asked me to give you that. - Thanks. - Your boy's useful, Bob. - Three goals! You'll come up and have a bit of snack with us, Davey? I'll drop in a bit later. I've got a bit of business. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Hear your lad's doing well, Slogger. If I sent him a telegram saying I was starving, he'd send me a wreath. ...Cast into a bottomless pit. We're through with Scupper Flats. Let's have something cheery. And out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth... - (KNOCKING) - Come in. Yes? I'm expecting him over. Yes, Fenwick? - I wondered if you still wanted a tutor. - Changed your mind? I needed the time for studying but now I'm leaving the school... - Oh? - Yes. Mr Strother's given me notice. I heard he wasn't satisfied. It's a disappointment after the trouble I've taken. I was producing results. But if the school doesn't consider you efficient... I'll give you another chance. - Thank you, Mr Barras. - You can't expect the same terms. What did I offer? Half a crown a lesson, three lessons a week. Tell you what I'll do. I'll give you ten shillings a week for five lessons. You can start tonight. Arrange it with my son. Good afternoon. Thank you. - I didn't know you were waiting. - That's all right, Mr Barras. - You're running Millington's now? - And a partnership in the offing. - I like to see one of my own men get on. - Proud of it, Mr Barras. - Davey Fenwick. How are you? - Fine, Joe. - How are you doing? - Just pulled off a big deal. I like to see a man getting on. Remember me to... Jenny. - It's been kept quiet? - You don't want the men to know? Maybe they wouldn't understand with all this about Scupper Flats. If I know where to find the best coking coal, it's my duty to my firm. There's no reason why anyone should know. You worried about young Fenwick? - You know him very well. - I did and I didn't. He's headstrong. Just lost his schoolmaster job. - Got the sack? - Pity. He had brains. Shame he threw himself away over a bit of a lass. I'll drop in on them and cheer him up. Poor fellow, losing his job and all. J... How can we live on ten shillings a week? I'll get another post somewhere. I'll advertise in Tynecastle. We can sell this house and stay with my mother. Your mother? I'd rather starve! I've got ambitions. I was meant to be a lady, not a skivvy for a failure! - (KNOCKING) - He's here again. The never-never man. He can take his rotten furniture away for all the chance we've got of paying for it! Don't be an idiot, Jenny. Hello, Jenny. D'you remember me? Joe. Hello, Joe. I hope you don't think I was trying to cut Jenny's throat. - The thought never entered my head. - What a silly thing to say. Come in, Joe. Wonderful to see you again, isn't it, David? - Yes. Come in. - I just had a minute. - Seen your father? - That big boozer! He's not a bad sort. Sit down. Have some tea. Only for a minute. I've business with Barras. We're selling him some of those new pumps. - At least Scupper Flats has closed down. - There wasn't much to worry about there. - You didn't always think so. - How's married life treating you? - It's ever so nice. - How's business, Davey? He's doing ever so well. The school think a lot of him. Mr Barras thinks the world of him. He's got the job of teaching his son in the evenings. - Haven't you? - Well done, Davey. Not doing bad yourself. I don't hold with grumbling, but it does get a fellow down. Paris this week, Brussels the next, London... - (KNOCKING) - Tell them I'm not in. Probably my creditors have spotted your car, Joe. David's going out tonight, Joe. I've got a bit of business myself tonight. Hardly a moment to myself. Visitor for you, Joe. Hello, Dad. It is grand to see you again. Thanks for all them five quids you never sent me. What brings you here? Tynecastle too hot? You can't stop him having a joke. I was just coming to see you. I'd have killed you if you hadn't. Jenny. - You're doing well. - A lot of expenses. Here's some more. All the lads are at the Salutation. You're celebrating the closing of Scupper Flats with us. - I've got five minutes. - I can drink plenty in five minutes. - Bye, Mrs Fenwick. - Bye, Jenny. I'm looking forward to riding with you. Joe always makes me laugh. He's a success. That's what he is. - I could have had him by raising my finger. - Why didn't you? Why didn't I?! Because I was a fool, that's why. A fool! A fool! So four is the relative change between the second variable and that of the first. Obviously, if A does not differ from X, this ratio has no meaning. It certainly hasn't any meaning for me. I'm no good at mathematics. I don't want to be an engineer. - Why are we wasting our time, then? - Father wants me to follow him at the pit. I loathe it. All this Scupper Flats business. The men didn't break through. Their luck held out. Yes, it did, didn't it? Just held out. - What's worrying you, Arthur? - It won't hold out forever. Is it anything to do with Mr Gowlan? Coking coal for Millington's! Scupper Flats isn't closing down after all. - I'm not sure about this money clause. - That's between me and Mr Millington. Of course. - How then, Joe? - Hello, Davey. - Mr Barras. - What do you want? That's another contract for coking coal. - I employ you to teach my son arithmetic. - I hope you've got a strike clause. Don't be hasty. Why do you think I'm here? - I don't know. Why? - I'll tell you. Millington was signing this contract and I was worrying about Scupper Flats. I had to try and stop it, but Mr Barras convinces me I'm wrong. You rat. You told me they were certain to break through that coal face one day. You thanked God you were out of it. Remember the strike? You said you weren't going to drown to keep Barras fat! - Nobody's going to drown to keep you fat! - You think you can make them strike? Start that misery all over again? There's not going to be any more misery. I'll get union backing. I'm going to see Harry Nugent. Get it put before the union on Wednesday. If I can't do anything else, I'll raise a stink! What right's he got to poke his nose into other folks' business? Think of Mr Millington. Does he have any influence with the union? He might. We can't do anything till tomorrow morning. That might be too late. - How's he going to get back tonight? - He can't. There isn't a train. Let him go and see Mr Harry Nugent MP. - Thank you, Mr Barras. Goodnight. - See yourself to the door, will you? - All right. - Oh, Gowlan? There'd be plenty of warning of any danger? The pit? Yes, of course there would. Goodnight. Of course. I can convince them if you give me the chance. You were convincing that day at the college. - You said you'd help me, remember? - When you'd got your degree. I had great hopes of you, young Fenwick. I had the notion you could step into my shoes. It was a great disappointment when you didn't think it was so important. I'm not asking anything for myself. - Aye. Maybe. You want me? - When you're through. I'll do what I can for you. Thanks, Mr Nugent. - How are you getting back? - Don't worry. I'll hop onto a lorry. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Davey. I thought you weren't coming back. Did you, Joe? I had to come round to settle our difference. - Forgive and forget? - That's the way. It didn't seem right to let a misunderstanding come between us. There's no misunderstanding for me, Joe. That's the spirit. Two sides to every question, eh? I thought you were never coming back. Where have you been? - Tynecastle. - You're so quiet. Come and tell me about it. It wasn't a silly old mining thing, was it? Yes, it was a silly old mining thing. I wish you wouldn't waste all your lovely brain on these things. - I've had a great idea. - Have you, darling? I've been thinking about you not having a job and I thought that you could go along to Millington's and have a talk to Joe Gowlan. I'm sure he could get you in there and he thinks a lot of you. - Does he? - You know he does. Don't let's have any silly jealousy. I'm only thinking of you getting on. - Joe would give me a job? - Yes. But you'd have to give up the silly ideas about miners. - People don't have any patience with it. - Did Joe say that? Yes, of course... You've always loved Joe, haven't you? I can't blame you. I blame myself for falling in love with you. (DRILL WHIRRS) Go ahead. Ton after ton, further and further into that barrier holding back a million tons of floodwater! - Have they taken drill tests? - Drill tests! You've all been working miners and you know that without plans you can't tell if your drill tests are deceiving you. We can't inspect the plans because the mine owner insists that they never existed. My father insists that they did and still do and I'd like to know why they can't be inspected. We can't listen to just anyone who may have seen some plans. The men in Scupper Flats listened, and starved for three months to avoid it. Anyway, Barras wouldn't risk flooding his own mine. There are owners who will take a gamble. There are few miners who don't. This gamble I beg you not to be a party to. You may deny you intend to be a party to anything, just to do nothing. Like the man who sits and watches a child drowning. He's not a party to it. There's no crime he can be accused of - certainly not murder. If these men drown in Scupper Flats, nobody can accuse you of murder. You'll say you were not a party to it. So will you and you. But what will your conscience say? And yours and yours? It is in your hands today to decide whether these men should enter that death trap. Your hands and yours! Today! They're stripping it now - that barrier holding back a million tons of water. - Mr Chairman. - Yes, Mr Wilkins? We've all been swept off our feet by the eloquence and sincerity of this young man. Hear, hear! But is he as sincere as we think? Please tell me when you decided to come here today. - Last Saturday night. - Aye. Scupper Flats had been going for three years and it wasn't till last Saturday that you decided to put this before us? That's when I heard about the new contract. Aye. A contract which you knew was of great value to Mr Gowlan. What are your personal relations with Mr Gowlan? - We used to be friendly. - Aye. Up until last Saturday night. The night you decided to try to put a stop to this contract of Mr Gowlan's. You and Mr Gowlan quarrelled? That has nothing to do with my coming here today. Was it a bitter quarrel, Mr Fenwick? It came to blows? It had no connection with my coming here. I believe it was your wife you quarrelled about, Mr Fenwick. Your wife has left you as a result of it. - Hasn't she? - What's that to do with Scupper Flats? If Scupper Flats is dangerous now, it's been dangerous for three years, yet you didn't do anything about it till last Saturday. The night that you had this violent quarrel with Mr Gowlan. I put it to you, Mr Fenwick, that you were determined to do anything you could to revenge yourself upon him and that's why you're here today. - Thank you, Mr Chairman. - It's obvious who's behind this and why. - Mr Fenwick... - He's given you a false impression. - I beg you not to be stampeded into it. - Mr Fenwick. - Come on, lad. You're wasting your breath. - Thank you for the trouble you've taken. The next agenda item is whether to use paint or wallpaper at the Gateport branch. Mr Williams? - How did you get on, Davey? - No good. I told you you were wasting your time. Davey. I hear you didn't pull it through. What happened? I did my best, but I'm afraid that... You can't do better than your best, but I thought... - You going down, Pat? - Mr Fenwick's showing me the ropes. - I'll break you in, boy. - Davey! Davey! It's happened. The letter just came. They've asked me. - Asked you what? - To play for Tynecastle. They were watching the match when I scored three goals. I've got a trial! - Grand, lad. - Slogger! I'm playing for Tynecastle. I told you they had their eye on me. You didn't believe me. I'm playing next Saturday! Not so hasty! Wait for the international. - Don't be all day. - Just putting on the artistic touches. - You coming to see me play Saturday? - 'Course I am. They're thinking of running excursions so everyone can come. Harry won't be there. He's got his whippet entered for the County Stakes. - He'll win it. - Break his neck if he doesn't. I've got two and a tanner on him. Yahoo! Mind your backs! - This isn't the scenic railway! - Just saving Scandinavia the trouble. Scandinavia? Let's get this propped up. No hurry. Don't see why we should slave our guts out for our Joe. Get back quick. Come on, son. The cage! Come on! Come on to the next tunnel! (SHRILL WHISTLING) - Did you get that rig? - Just trying, Mr Barras. Get electrical gear. Ring Amalgamated. Every rescue man. Steam winding gear. - Get hold of... - Scupper line! - Hello. - We've got to Scupper number five. Water's rising and the tunnels are blocked. There's five of us. - Have you tried the air tunnels? - They're full of gas. - Get out. - The rig's...! I'll attend to that. Get out. - Hello. - Listen, Fenwick, carefully. Make for the old workings along the upper tunnel. There's only a frame dam at the end. Old workings? The water's all in the lower level. Don't take the branches or the left dip. Keep due east for 1,500 yards. - So you did have them plans! - (EXPLOSION) This way. Come on. Hurry up. (ALARM BELLS CLANG) - Let 'em in. Barras's order. - All right. Come on. My son's down there, Barras. My son Bob. Why don't you go and fetch him out? That'll do no good, Tom! What's being done? Most of the shift are in the upper levels. We're in constant touch. - Is our Bob in there? - There's a man getting the names through. Your husband was cut off, but he found a way into the old workings. - Is Hughie there? - I don't know. - Can I come? - Yes. Stay in the yard, Mother. Come on, Pa. - Hurry up, lad. - Come on, Pa. Come on. Watch your step, Hughie. You're no good to United with a broken leg. I'll be better than some they've got! - Blocked. - That's no sight for sore eyes. There's no frame dam about this. All right, Pat. We're above water level and a relief party will be drilling through any minute. - We've nowt to do but wait. - Aye. A rest won't do us any harm. Best go easy on these pit lamps. We're going to take it in turn jarring. I'll start. (KNOCKS RHYTHMICALLY) Pity we lost Harry. He was looking forward to his whippet winning on Saturday. Saturday was Harry's big day. I'll think of him when I'm playing in the trial. # Oh my, you should see us gannin' # Passing the folks along the road just as they were stannin' # There were lots of lads and lasses there All with smiling faces # Gannin' along the Scotswood Road # To see the Blaydon races # Oh, my... # (RHYTHMIC KNOCKING) We're through! Keep on for 300 yards. Take the right dip. It might be half a mile there. If only we had some plans we'd know. A plan wouldn't remove that fall. We must expect difficulties. We must blast a new way above it. Come on. Let's get on with it. Mr Fenwick, I feel really bad. It's my stomach. Hey. I know that. Would you believe it? I don't know if there's much nourishment in them. My cough drops in my pocket and I forgot all about them. - First time in my life. - Thank you, Mr Fenwick. - What day would you say it was, Father? - Friday morning I'd say, lad. - It isn't Saturday yet? - No, nowt like that. It can't be, can it? Call that calling? We'll be here till Doomsday! - We've got to be out by Saturday. - Before closing time an' all. What I could do to a pint! I've still got that last cough drop. Would you like it now? Come on, lad, buck up. Good evening, Mr Nugent. We got the men out of Globe Cove. Nearly 80 of them. Mrs Fenwick. Nasty business this. The union are feeling sick that they didn't listen to your son that day. Aye. They'd eat out of his hand now. I know that much. A disaster's a disaster. It's a chance every pit man's got to take. - I expect they'll get your men out. - Maybe. How about our Pat? You're an MP, what are you doing? - Sarah, they're doing everything they can. - Aye. Everything they... - What's the matter? - Stroke. Been overdoing it. - What's the progress? - Still a chance, Mr Nugent. Wept... maybe we should have a service. A service? Let us take for our text the 12th verse of the eighth chapter... of the Book of John. "I am the Light of the world. "They that follow me shall not walk in darkness, "but shall have the light of life." Down in this pit, dear brethren, there is darkness. All around us there is darkness. But the Light of the world is here, even here in the darkness of this pit. What's all this preaching about? This isn't Sunday. It isn't Sunday, is it? It's not Saturday yet. Woe, my brethren, is our lot upon earth! And the fourth angel sounds and another star falls in the bottomless pit! Put a sock in it, Wept! I see it, my brethren. I am given the gift of prophecy. A prophet in the paradise pit! - Sit down, man. - I see them... (LOW RUMBLING) - Another fall up here. - How's it down there? - Can't do it without timber. - Barras knew his way about here. He's no use to us now. There's nowt we can do but try this way. I've lived a rotten life. Rotten. Just a boozer. A big boozer. The timber's giving! Get back! We'll have to give it up. Davey. Young Fenwick. We want you to represent the men at the inquiry. Represent the men? What men? My father? Hughie? Mrs Winthrop's two sons? Harry Grace? Slogger Gowlan? Wept? Young Pat Reedy? What am I going to say? "It was all very sad. No one was to blame." I know what you want and you'll get your chance. The world's like a wheel. Your turn will come. The way you said that, you sounded like my father. Night, Mr Nugent. Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation and deliver us from all evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory. For ever and ever. Amen. And so, out of the darkness of the world that is into the light of the world that could be and must be. A world purged of its ancient greeds. A world where dreams are not empty or sacrifices in vain. A world of infinite promise, which the unconquerable spirit of man will some day forge into fulfilment.
