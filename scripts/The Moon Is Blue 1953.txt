I was not sure that ... He had to speak. I shouted "Hey!" but you were soaring you. No, I meant in the shop. Why are pumice stones? - To remove ink from my hands. And you needed elastic? Yes, for my work. You monitor me closely. And razor blades ... - I shave. , You did not buy anything. I wanted a lovely lipstick but it cost $ 1.50 and I gave up. It was beautiful, it was called ... - "Pastel Pink". A trite name. For me? - I rarely put. As you are nice! You also watch me. - Yes, for a long time. I had to smile to jewellery. It's not my style. You could smile, the body, instead of you scowl. I wanted to take the defiantly. - You have me doubled elevators. Upon entering the elevator, I thought you were behind me. Is not that wonderful? We do not see much today. We see Welfare Island. You dream? We see nothing. - Me, I see! Not even the Chrysler building. - Me, I see it! You are crazy! - My imagination sees. Down, it was announced: bad visibility. There is not a cat. I do not mind. I'm glad to be. We are more 300 meters high. The tallest building in the world. This is wonderful! Of course it was madness. But it was worth it. About ... Voil your dollars 1.20. How so? Despite challenging your scowling, I paid two inputs. I explained to the cashier we had bickered and she gave me your money. So it is you who invite me? How nice! Thank you very much. I'll enjoy it more. And you do not know my name. What is your name? My name is Patty O'Neill. Don Gresham. Don? You name it goes very well. Patty, it rarely happens to me follow a woman. I wonder how it works. For 10 cents, you'll know. - Thank you, you're nice. When you arrived, I pretended. I've realized. It's great! Has seen for miles. Do you watch? I am already come. My office is in the building. You seem you impatient. Would you hold my hand? You are a little crazy but your hand is soft. What do you think? I want to cry. - Why? All these people ... - What people? In Brooklyn ... Brooklyn is it. - And then I want to cry. Why? - This is so sad. Live in Brooklyn? Not kidding. I was born there. I do not understand what you mean. These poor people working a sweat ... It is not known by such weather. - Do not be so down-to-earth. There was so much fog, descend. I like it here. Can not you cold? I always have cold hands when I moved. And you are excited? I dreamed of climbing here. - You could not? It was too expensive for me. The price of a pair of socks! I do not know what made me decide! - What you're cute. It will not hold. - But if it will hold. Well, let's say it does not. Descend and go to dinner. - No. Why? - I've already costed quite expensive. Do not say that. - An entrance and a lipstick! And 10 cents telescope! - It's true. Voila! You would not of a needle and thread? If, in fact, I have. I'm going to sew immediately. Hold a second needle. No scissors? Give me the button. You dropped the needle! Too bad! I see is bigger a haystack. Come to my office. You recoudrez button. You have a needle? My secretary has many needles. Good try. What is your occupation? - Architect. That explains pumice. Designer? No, a real architect. I can build a cathedral or a shelter. How much is a cathedral, a little? Your name on the door! You are known? I am a good way architect. Your secretary is not? She leaves to 17 hours. But it must have a needle. So try it. Do not ask me why he bites his leg. There are probably a needle. What have we here? Stamps, paper clips ... We burn: pins! Have you ever seen sew? I'm afraid ... When you know, you know she probably thread and needle. Will see in my office. That's funny! Looks like a umbrella stand! I understand was what use elastic. I can watch? Please. Civic Centre. You built it? It is constructed. - Find your needle. Needle? I'll look in the workbook has the letter "A". It's funny to watch a building thinking that created it, right? I'll tell you a secret. My first build was an ugly brick shed. I went at night admire for hours. Alone? Sheds do not interest many people. It's more fun to admire someone. Who is this? Her name is Cynthia. She is cute. Very cute. It is not on the desktop? - She was there. Are you in love with her? I do not know. I was. I'm not any more. You like she? - How do I know? You were engaged? We were more or less ... It's over. There are clearly not needle. Or do you want dinner? - Nowhere. We have dinner together. Useless to discuss. You can go to Stork Club? - Of course. It's too expensive for boys that I frequent. Generally, we'll eat spaghetti. I prefer a good steak. Like the Stork Club? I'll rarely. But people love the show. I'm an actress. Known or beginner? - Rather beginner. Are you one of those bitten that theatre in the blood? No, I think I'd rather marry. Sure, I'd rather marry. But the kind of man I'm looking for is not easy. Will he find the Empire State Building? You are not my kind of man. - Oh no? You looked so awkward arranging your button. And you are too young. Have you ever been married? I want to marry a mature man, very rich. I wish he was married. Too bad if he has 5 kids. It's not very romantic. Love is good for the girls. I would rather be appreciated that pampered. You believe it would be my kind? Yes, you must be very demonstrative. I like that. I am very affectionate. Show me that. Cynthia was loving it? You ask too many questions. Come on. Why do we go to 79th Street? The Stork Club is not there. I know. But this is my address. Can I go to the Stork Club without button? But I ... We take a glass then you recoudrez my button. Singles have no needle. I am different. Does not it bother you to go? I do not know. You try to seduce me? I do not know. Probably. Why? I need to know. You should feel this stuff. It poses no such questions. Me, though. Always. And if you answered we will try to seduce you? I believe and I lose a dinner. If we say we have pure intentions? In general, I believe ... But sometimes they are wrong. I hate those men it. Both girls willing to be seduced why choose those who do not want? Good. I will not give you the court. Do you believe me? Yes. You are nice. I like you. I might be lying. - It's true. Do you tell lies? I do not know. I never met a girl like you. This is nice! - I will maybe kiss. That I do not see any problem. I wonder if you are naive or if you let me walk. It's simple, listen to me. In a man, two things can happen to a girl: lose its virtue or fight to keep it. I will neither lose, or fight. I also play cards on the table. Is not that better? Okay. Awarded. Affection without passion. Promise! Affection without passion. Sounds like a slogan for elections. You are exquisite although a little crazy. Patty O'Neill. You are very Irish. Dad was born in Brooklyn, but Irish parents. It has real angers of Irish. What is he doing? - He's a cop. Currency of 10 dollars? Does not it bother you to go? At all. - Without fear? No fear! Not I doubt your manhood. Leaving that aside ... - Men are weird. They are upset that they be trusted. But why do you trust him? I believe honest man. Women feel these things it. I want my three daughters feel it too! Thank you. To that I just learned, a psychologist I would pay 25 dollars. As better than it not gene you. - That what bothers me? In general, men hate virgins. Not you. Many women went home? I do not remember. The elevator boy he frowns? The elevator boy is an electric button. It was Cynthia. - You said it was over. For me, it's over. - She had a determined look. This way. Excuse me. Hi, Mike. Not tonight. I go out. Weekend? Okay. A later. Who is Mike? - A friend of mine. Are you angry? - No. Why? You hang up so fast. I had nothing to tell him. I could not dine with him. You could chat. I always chat with my friends. I have no doubt. Or will you put her photo? With my winter socks. Who wrote it? BASTARD! Probably the maid. Why she would treat you bastard? I do not give him tips. Needles. You will what? Martini? I just want a little lemonade. - I'm sorry, I do not have lemon. Too bad, I confine myself to an olive. An olive. Give me your jacket. Where is the button? Jacket ... Button. A Picasso litho. Like it? No, I find it appalling. If your apartment was to me, I embarrassed. Me, I love it. - Put it in the room? She is well and she stayed. What love cooking! If you saw our oven! Vicki argues that the date of the flood. This is my room-mate. And mill waste! Vicki marry anyone for a kitchen with grinder. The martini, you do not like? I liked it but I do not drink any more. Why? It is posh drinking when you do not feel very. I can take off my shoes? - Remove what you want. You have pretty feet. - Thank you. Do you have a mistress? A mistress? Is not expression a bit dated? It's old fashioned but explicit. Did you? You ask these question? You are single and you seem at ease. Most singles have one. We do not ask people suddenly they have a mistress. Me, though. It saves time. We always know sooner or later. Did you? Actually, no. - So much the better. I'm happy. Why do not you? You are not obliged to answer. I think maybe it's posh to have a mistress when you do not feel very. It is very fair. And Cynthia ...? - It was not my mistress. I did not say that. - You were going to say. You're really any more engaged? Any more. She is very cute. It has a nice chin. Home, everything is nice. - So she was your mistress! No, nothing of the sort! If you say that everything is beautiful in it is ... Sex great concern to you. Me? - Yes, you. You really believe that? You ask if you want to seduce you, if you like virgins, if you have a mistress. If sex does not concern you ... That may be true. But it is better than I am qu'occupe concerned with sex. Now that you actually two. It started to rain. When you broke up with Cynthia? It happened last night or this morning. Between. That is why she wrote "bastard"? You did not believe in the right? - Not for a second. It makes you much trouble? - You think so? I asked you if you loved and yet you hesitated. She has left a void in my heart. - Why did you break up? You ask too many questions. I'm sorry. It is not by indiscretion. I am interested in people. My God! What time is it? 8:35 p.m.. Why? - My sketch has spent 20h. A TV? - I turned veiled weeks. What a pity! - Too bad. He returns at midnight. We look. - No. I'll be in my bed. But look at it. Midnight, the 4th string. Now go to dinner. - Okay. Let's go. You will be soaked not waterproof. Do not go. Dine here. I am good cooker. But I do not excellent food! You something. Would that remains? I focus very much remains. Like the marineau? - Excuse me? Based on herring fillets. Did you? - I would not want to have. Do not say that. It is delicious. The only thing vaguely edible here this is cheese I was sent a Christmas. It's blue! - It turns blue. You never eat here? Not surprising you are unhappy! I'm not at all unhappy. How sad! Love this kitchen unused and this beautiful glacier and the oven. And mill nobody uses. It is a cry. You are the strangest girl I know. You know me hardly. - It does not mean anything ... I think we would do well not to mention both. Why? Because it should not. That's all. Why? In case you have a crush to one another. It would be boring? Yes, having approached me, you always wondering questions. How about? About those who could accost me before you, as you. I am already asked. It happens to you often? Once and doubt intrudes. - My doubts were dispelled. Doubts may dissipate but they come back. You built? No. I want to build one day. This is just one project. Charming. But you will not find ever such trees. They exist. I field. One day I will build the hut. The room? Three windows. A large fireplace or you can do a roast beef. In a room, it would be funny. Branch of the oak be 60 cm from the balcony. If I had such a tree, I live it. When I was a kid ... Do you like children? I can not see them. You find the world too rotten in order to give birth to children? Children are not born they cleanse the world? I had not thought of. Enough to think. And dinner? You want to prepare here? What to do with a piece of cheese? I have a waterproof, I can go to the grocery store. This would be perfect! I love to cook but this is rarely a man. I live with a girl. - You relieve me. Who is concerned about sex already? - Okay ... What does it buy? - I'll make a list. Leave me alone. I want to think about everything. I registered all except commodities. Do it alone. Hold. Well, what do you expect? I do not want to introduce myself elections with your slogan. "Affection without passion." For me ... You are not passionate but hungry. Go to the grocer. I'm faster than lightning. Put boots. It's pouring. I never wear these ... Put them! - Do not order me! This is my maternal instinct speaking. How old are you? - 30 years, why? 30 years! Let's see. Half, it's 15. 7. 22! It's great! It just falls! What? It is said that the woman must have half the man's age plus 7. What a woman ... What man? - Nothing ... Go ahead. I will report what it takes for breakfast. Do not you worried, Vicki. He is an architect. It has a beautiful apartment, in 79th Street. His name is Don Gresham and has beautiful eyes Cocker. Wait a second, it rings. Cynthia you are, is not it? I heard so much about you. What an adorable puppy! Don went to buy steaks. I will prepare our dinner. Why did you write "bastard"? What has happened? Do you want to wait? It does not hurt has a fly. He loves the kids and a beautiful oak. An oak, that's it. Never mind, I'll explain. It still sounds. I'll call you later. Goodbye, do you not worried. I want to be good ... - Be what? I did not think find a woman here. Why? This is not an ungodly hour. No, of course. Mr. Gresham is it? I came out, but it will come back. Will you come? I do not think I ... I thought Don would. Do you want a drink? - With pleasure. I had a headache this morning but a glass ... I know. I have already treated over cooked there are parish priests. They do not mix. I'm David Slater. And you? - Patty O'Neill. Very pretty name. Been to Don long? No, but I feel there a long time. It is cabbage. I'm crazy about him. Very interesting ... Is it crazy to you? Our feelings are platonic. - Sure ... My feet hurt me, so I took off my shoes. Do not say that. - Why? That is true. Say instead: "I've hurt my foot." "My feet hurt" expression is down-to-earth. Sit down. This chair rotates. Wheelchair turning often for me. You do not drink? - I do not drink. Do you know Cynthia? - Yes, of course. It was the bride of Don ... Finally, more or less. More or less? Their engagement were rather vague. Waves? II told you? - No. In any case, it's over. Yes, I know. Don has row with his socks. Was she a wound? Difficult to say. - Why? Answer yes or no. It is not so simple. - Why not? It turns out that ... Cynthia is my daughter. Excuse me. If I had known, I would not have asked you that. I know it well. It is. In any case, it is superb. What did you say about socks? Nothing. Forget it. Don went to buy steaks. We will dine here. I am good cooker. Like steak? - I love it. If you stay to dinner with us? - No. But thank you anyway. Is this because of Cynthia? Have they broken because of you? No. I had two fingers love him as a son. I asked to give them my blessing. Is it collapsed? - He needs more than that! But I am. I relied on him. You are sorry they have broken. I know nothing what happened. You seem to want a Don. A he wrong? It is to know I'm here. It seems that I should horsewhip Mr. Gresham. Why? Cynthia told me this morning, it seems ... You do not know? I was not clear, and she talked a lot. What? It seems that he has "taken liberties with love "my daughter. One would not Don. - It's not that I quote Don. Ms. Slater? - I'm divorced And this is not my wife but Cynthia told me. I do not know to raise my daughter. She probably needs a mother. - A mother or a good spanking. Give him one or the other. You are young, you remarry. Women who attract me would not be a good influence. So give him a spanking. The idea smiled enough. You know ... Do you think this is a man which principles? Certainly. He is charming. I was told as charming, but I do not have principles. Tell me. Is this a man who ... - Or do you want to come? In my place, you would understand. Cynthia you worried? I understand. Is she pregnant? - No, of course! Why ask that? That's what worried fathers. Quite correct. Mr. Slater, do not worry. I do not ... I do not know but I know Don. He would not do that. Forget it. You will stay for dinner with us and everything will be better after. If we ask first Notice of Don? Why? It will surely agree. If I had a pretty circumvented daughter to make my dinner and we came to disturb us, I should be sorry. You said "circumvented"? - Yes, but ... Me, I always say "cerconvenu". It says "circumvented"? It seems to me. See "cerconvenu" or "circumvented" ... I do not know. What silly word! In any case, the fact is. You prefer to be alone both. Why? II may be projects for later. No. It is agreed. He vowed not to court me. He keeps his word. But after dinner, it may be more affectionate. I hope that he will kiss me. He did not kiss me from the Empire State Building. Since its construction? No. This is the that we met. Use another drink. - I do not say no. Want I put the TV? Colour? You dream! It does not yet exist. So expect. He falls ropes. What did you like the car? A Lincoln. Why? With the new Cadillac and all its gadgets, when it rains, pressing a button flooding the wind shield and the view is clear. For it rains, I think. - You have a Cadillac? Good God, no! Flirting Vicki has a and I can use it. Not the car, the gadget. - Who is Vicki? Vicki is my friend. She'll like it. She's my age, but she incubates me like a mother hen. She is a model. You're one too? I also sometimes but I am an actress. Or rather, I'd like to be. But it's hard. There is so much competition. Poor Vicki! She has no luck. As a model? - I mean emotionally. The boy is the Cadillac love with her and it is very rich. And she has "no chance"? He is married and does not want to hurt his wife. He studied. Me too, but in my school, his wife was hurt rule. Cynthia Does something? Theatre? It does nothing? - No. Finally nothing that fills me paternal pride. Can you be proud of? What does he? - You kicked me a low blow. It is expression. Parents who complain always infuriate me. It's their fault. I always say. Do tell more. Why? - It's too sad. It is common, mundane and terribly true. Can be corrected. - I feel like you always say that. That is true. You probably the makings of a very good father. I love how your eyes shine. You are very cute. Why you up so? - I thought we should get up. Because I had the sudden desire and violent kiss you have you crush lips. Is that true? I must be in one of my good days. Rather than give a ... But it is wonderful to be desired! Explain to me. You are not more or less flirting Don? We met today Rooftop the Empire State Building. Here I am informed. Do not misunderstand. It is in all honesty. This is me. Open soon! I'm coming. I have enough to keep a seat a month. Maybe I'd better go. - Stay here. Don, come and see. What the hell are you doing there? - I invited Mr. Slater dinner. What? - But then ... Mr. Slater passed and I invited him to dinner. Then you should know ... I know. This is the father of Cynthia but he is not angry and it does not cravachera you. There me what? You talk too much. You do not know what a whip? Tell me everything. - We need to talk to men. I will prepare dinner talk all you want. Change socks. Your feet are soaked. She is very charming. Yes. I know for years. Lovely family. Lovely people attending the Empire State Building. I should have guessed. When did you come? II are 10 minutes. She talked a lot. Yes, I approached. But she's nice. Quite agree. Absolutely delicious. So ... What is the story of the whip? My daughter came to 10am. Correct. - She was with you! She spent the night here. - It claims ... It lies. I have not touched. And I doubt she told you ... She says that ... - She lies! Stop screaming: "She's lying." Let me finish my sentence. Let me quote what she said. Go. This morning I had lunch buffet, Finally I took aspirin, When Cynthia arrived in evening dress. I was suffocated. It is already home late, a 2, 3 or 5 in the morning. But never at 10am. Continue. I questioned, she told me she had slept here. Without prevarication. Like that. I was suffocated. You've already said. - It was not the same suffocation. When my daughter told me she had stayed here, I told him: What? Yes! I told him: "Small, you would not have done that! " Or something of the same kind. Morality is not my forte. - What did she say? She said: "You're right, it was a mistake." Then she spun in her room and took a shower. And you went to seek a whip. - You are misplaced joke. My daughter has just said that you had offended. She did not say anything more specific? She did not say it: "It offended me." And she repeated. It lies. I have not touched. Believe me. There I have an idea. This may be just the offence you made it. I understand she was angry. It is very humiliating. I should correct you. Wait till I understand. I deserve the whip for not having seduced your daughter? It is a new aspect of the problem. Who is this? Let me pass! Do not do it! This is Cynthia. It is still the? Do not be innocent. I saw. She opened the door. Who is this peasant? I'm stage, remain civilized. Civilized? I am civilized! The proof the message on the mirror! If you treat her like me also write on your ice cream. If she can write! And what you said this morning, you would not make ... How dare she? - She looks like her mother. Let me pass! - You'll have to go over my body. Your daughter hates to say no and hate those who say no. I do not doubt your word, but I do not understand what happened between you and why? I'll explain. We went to dinner and theatre. Around midnight, I brought you home. I said goodnight at the door and came here. 5 minutes later, she arrived. She had found thee, drunk and with a young woman. She was young, indeed. - Cynthia found it very amusing. But it is sad. And she did not want to go back. Too degrading? - In order not to disturb you. She slept in my room and me on the couch. Everyone was not amused yesterday. Tell me. In such a case, why a man he would sleep on the couch? Not to mention the scruples there is a fear of commitment. But you were not more or less engaged? Big difference between "committed" and "fianc". Between us, I wanted to keep initiatives. I thought about it. You're an intellectual. When you have the ball, we do not like lose stumbled into a bed. I am not versed in football, but the player is there as referee? Who called? - You talk soccer now? Yes. We talked a missed attack. Until now, it's delicious. No ketchup? A minute ... - I'll. She'll get it. Can not let her do it. Women love to work. I'll open it. I have more strength. Men are packed! Give me that. We should have out the champagne. Excuse me, If I had known you were coming ... And voila. - Thank you. But it does not come. - Neck too narrow, perhaps. You and your ketchup! How awkward! Do it yourself instead. - I have a better idea. I'll lend you a dress room. Take off your dress. You ruined the evening. You're amused. If you were leaving? And leave this poor little alone with you? I would! It was not a good dinner? - The best I've eaten. Can not find? - You want to keep a husband? My wife was very nice. She was superb souffls. I devoured and I always said: "Blown Magnifique!" or "What blew!" often even "That's blown!" One hour later while I was digesting, she had to say: "The souffl was good?" What happened? - You divorced her. She filed for divorce. I had thrown a dish ... You dare? Flat blew stainless steel still hot, right on the behind. She had a beautiful blue, for after his lawyer. Me, I have not seen. I do not believe it. - This is a kind. You hit women? - I do not fight women. I'm belligerent, but also loose. You will fight although a small man. If it is helpless. - You are disgusting. No wonder she divorced. It's funny that a woman is married! Do not I have a strange charm? Yes, you too charming. - And it is especially strange. You're too good. And my ... - I want to hear! For heaven's sake, what do you want? No way! If you do not want to ride, returns this bitch. Stop it! Returns this treasure and let me down. No and no! Under any circumstances! Very good. Because ... You're so horrible ... and indifferent, I'm going to drown in my bathtub. Stopped this melodrama! I am already in the bathtub. You hear that? Come, listen, do not ... No. Hear thou it. I'll be ready in 2 minutes. Meet me down and will take a glass at Luigi. Remembering the good old days. I will not make any stage. But nothing a minute. I'm sorry, but I must go out. But where are you going? - I'll be back in 10 minutes. Do not hold back. It is not funny. He did not say a word. Some words have tempted me, but there is a lady. You got dressed quickly. - I have something to tell you. The maid will. - No, I like storing. Cleanliness approach perfection. Perfection has never tempted me. - What do you like? Eat, drink, make love. In order. You are not so misguided. You marry me? To be a hatchet blow dishes? I was too glib tongue. But you're Irish, you would make me instantly. Then? - So what? Will you marry me? And if I accepted? I will not ask for it. You'd be the last man, I refuse. It is a thoughtless response. If I were alone with a million women you would beat hard to become my wife. You aspirer has repopulate the world. - Do not kid yourself. Your duty to the human race prevail. I can not find the beautiful human race. And I have no prejudice against you. You hear that dog? - This is the damn dog Cynthia. The dirty dog! Look! Finally, a small dog could not ... But where are you going? Remove your shoes. You will soak. I did not want wading the inside. There is that Eskimos who are civilized. Why? They sell their daughters a birth. I would like Cynthia learn to like you. You are safe as you do not marry me? Very sure. That is cute! Rather courant! - Bring me towels! They are in the entrance! As for my marriage proposal, I'll make you knees of it will be dry. You often ask unknown in marriage? I have already offered a friendly cohabitation without marriage. And not to me? It is said that girls are depraved by runners my age. This is false. Alone have respect for the innocence. You are charming and probably a little drunk. I'm pretty simple. - So, you're crazy. You want to marry a rich man a bit wall. I am 41 years old. You act like a kid. - You'd be a mother to me. No thank you. - For Cynthia, then. She would be delighted. I'm 3 years older than her. You could become the stepmother of Don. Do not joke about marriage. And then you do not know me. You are smart, worker, young and gay, adventurous and good stove. You have a lovely face and pretty legs. Continue. It's not enough for you? Me, that's enough. And love? - We talk too much. It's nice to hear. - From the mouth of Don? Who knows? You are looking for a mature man able to appreciate you. I would also be happy. - I can make people happy. A flat shots blew? This superb shot broke our union! She married a wealthy Brazilian. She is happy and receives a pension. Now we can go down. Off, but I am here. Come on! You will not be alone here? No, not alone. If you leave, I will call a daughter and invite here. Daughter not saying is vulgar. This girl is vulgar, is to say it is easy. It is rather a girl a lady. It is fun. Then marry her. It would respect me more if I was as beast. You think to my offer? It still stands. This is weird. You are scary. You are frivolous and cynical, selfish and immoral. You are worthless and yet I like you a lot. Enough to marry me? Not enough to marry you, but I could do worse, much worse. Are you rich? Rich enough. I would even say: rich. I do not work and I still have a large income once my taxes paid, why? I wonder what it's like to be rich. So many girls marry just to be a shelter. Tempting ... Do you know how much money I possess? You must have 7.43 dollars and nothing in your bank account. I looked in your bag. - It was not good. I'm not a gentleman well. Tuesday I have a TV show. I earn U.S. $ 62.50 and seven dollars ... I already ..., it will give me almost 70 dollars. Once, I had more 200 dollars for a week. You do not know what it is. - What? The joy of knowing we have 200 dollars. We want taunt everyone. I won $ 600 in the game the other night. You need to be very excited? Do not be so blas! I thought I had 600 dollars in advance. I wonder ahead of what? I have on me. 6 tickets $ 100 brand new. What folly to have so much money on you! I lost a bag with $ 20. I've been sick. Let me give you these 600 dollars. You are crazy. - Do you agree? No, of course not. It is unconditional. - Why give me $ 600? Do me a favour by accepting. I can not accept ... - And unconditionally ... 600 divided by 40, that's how much? - 15, why? I spend $ 40 on average week. Thin! 15 weeks of insured! - Hammer? I have never accepted money like that. I have gained a frightful capitalist exploiter. Awarded? It is tempting. You would find me silly to say no? Yes.
