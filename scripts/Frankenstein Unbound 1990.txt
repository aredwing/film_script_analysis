HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE I GO THIS GASH ON MY FOREHEAD? - SPIRITS. - [ Laughter ] NEXT WITNESS. YOUR HONOR, JUSTINE MORITZ IS AN INNOCENT CHILD. - SIR, YOU'VE HAD YOUR SAY. - SHE'S INNOCEN AS THE BLESSED VIRGIN. FORGIVE ME, MISS GODWIN. THE YOUNG GIRL OVER THERE, IS SHE THE ONE ON TRIAL? YES. SHE'S ACCUSED OF KILLING WILLIAM FRANKENSTEIN, WHO WAS SIX. SHE LACKS THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH NECESSARY TO COMMI THE CRIME AS DESCRIBED, SO, OF COURSE, SHE'S ACCUSED OF WITCHCRAFT. IT IS A TRAVESTY. YES, BUT EXCELLENT MATERIAL FOR A BOOK, I SUPPOSE. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SIR? - MY NAME IS JOSEPH BUCHANAN. I'M A GREAT ADMIRER OF YOUR WORK, MISS GODWIN. YOU MUST BE CONFUSING ME WITH SOMEONE ELSE, MR. BUCHANAN. I'VE NEVER BEEN PUBLISHED. CAN YOU IDENTIFY THIS? IT'S THE LOCKET... THAT BELONGED TO WILLIAM. CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS CHARM CAME TO BE AMONGS YOUR BELONGINGS? WHEN I AWOKE, I FOUND IT. THE TRUTH IS, YOU TOOK IT AFTER KILLING WILLIAM FRANKENSTEIN, AFTER BREAKING HIS NECK AND WRENCHING HIS ARM FROM HIS BODY! COME, GIRL! ADMIT IT, AND ALLOW YOURSELF THE MERCY OF GOD'S FORGIVENESS. NO! NO! I-I DIDN'T DO IT! EXCUSE ME. NOW, AS TO THE CHARGE OF WITCHCRAFT-- YOUR HONOR, WE FIND JUSTINE MORITZ GUILTY... OF THE MURDER OF WILLIAM FRANKENSTEIN. JUSTINE MORITZ, YOU HAVE HEARD THE VERDICT. YOU ARE HEREBY SENTENCED TO HANG BY THE NECK TILL DEAD. EXECUTION IS SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW AT NOON. POOR KID. VICTOR, I BEG YOU NOT TO GO. WHERE ARE YOU? I KNOW YOU HAVE RETURNED. REVEAL YOURSELF. - [ Growls ] - [ Gasps ] WHO ARE YOU? GIVE ME WHAT YOU PROMISED, OR I WILL BREAK HIM, VICTOR! I WILL CRUSH EVERYONE AROUND YOU! THEN I WILL CRUSH YOU. [ Whimpering ] YOU MADE ME. NOW YOU WOULD DESTROY ME. WHY? - YOU MURDERED MY BROTHER. - MUR-DERED? YOU STOPPED HIS LIFE! HE WAS EASILY CRUSHED. YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE HIM STRONG, VICTOR, LIKE ME. I DID NOT MAKE WILLIAM. NO? THEN... WHO DID? HE WAS BORN OF WOMAN, YOU MONSTROUS WRETCH. I DID NOT ASK TO BE MADE MONSTROUS! I AM ALONE AND MISERABLE. MAKE ME A MATE AS YOU PROMISED. MAKE ME A MATE, AND YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN. I WILL NEVER MAKE ANOTHER LIKE YOU. MAKE ME A MATE, OR I WILL... MURDER ELIZABETH. VICTOR! WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME? ARE YOU FROM THE COURT? I TOLD YOU, I AM A DOCTOR. I KNOW OF YOUR DISCOVERY. I KNOW THAT YOU PUT LIFE INTO THAT CREATURE, AND I KNOW THAT HE IS KILLING. I WANTED TO GIVE MAN THE POWER TO CREATE LIFE, TO FREE HIM FROM A CRUEL AND FICTITIOUS GOD. WHAT MAN EVER ACHIEVED THAT? SCIENTISTS... HAVE MADE FAR GREATER MONSTERS THAN YOURS, VICTOR. TELL THE TRUTH. SHOW THE WORLD WHAT YOU HAVE CREATED. IMPOSSIBLE. I'VE CREATED AN ABOMINATION. WHAT ABOUT JUSTINE? WHO WILL FREE HER FROM THE MOB? YOU CANNOT LET HER PAY FOR YOUR SINS. WHAT SINS? I'M A SCIENTIST. I CANNOT SIN. SHE MUST DIE. THE TRUTH IS TOO UNBEARABLE. IF YOU WANT TO EASE YOUR CONSCIENCE ABOUT WILLIAM, THEN HELP THE GIRL. IF THEY KILL HER, HOW WILL YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF AFTER THAT? I DON'T KNOW. HELP THE GIRL, VICTOR. CONTINUOUS FLOW OF INK CONTAINED IN BARREL. REMARKABLE. DID YOU MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE GIRL IS INNOCENT? AND YOU SIMPLY LICK THIS? YES. IT TASTES LIKE-- PEPPERMINT. [ Laughing ] VICTOR, THE GIRL. YES, CERTAINLY. THE GIRL IS INNOCENT. GOOD. THEN I SHALL TAKE THIS LETTER IN THE MORNING... AND DELIVER I TO THE JUDGE IN PERSON. NO, NOT THE JUDGE. YOU MUST DELIVER I TO MY FIANCE, ELIZABETH. SHE'S OF GOOD FAMILY, AND THE JUDGE WILL LISTEN TO HER. YOU ARE TRULY A MARVEL, BUCHANAN. THIS ELECTRIC CARRIAGE-- YOU HAVE MASTERED THERMODYNAMICS, GEOMAGNETISM, SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE. WHERE DO YOU COME FROM? THE MOON? MOUNT OLYMPUS? I LIVE IN THE SAME WORLD YOU LIVE IN. YES, TRULY. THE WORLD OF SCIENCE. WE ARE BROTHERS, DOCTOR. [ Spectators Gasping, Cheering ] [ Both Giggling ] - [ Growls ] - [ Both Scream ] - WHO MADE YOU? - WHO ARE YOU? WHO MADE YOU? DID VICTOR MAKE YOU? [ Together ] HELP! HELP! BACK TO THE GATE, BOYS! - [ Growls ] - [ High-pitched Whistle ] [ Grunting ] STOP THAT! STOP... THAT! - [ Gasping ] - STOP THAT. [ Groaning ] FRANKENSTEIN VILLA? IS ELIZABETH HERE? IF YOU MEAN MISS LEVENZA, SHE DOES NOT LIVE IN THIS HOUSE. VICTOR ASSURES ME THAT SHE IS HERE. I HAVE AN URGENT LETTER FOR HER. AH, AH! VICTOR ASKED ME TO DELIVER IT TO HER IN PERSON. THANK YOU. STAY. I WILL INFORM MISS LEVENZA YOU ARE HERE. [ Chattering, Indistinct ] GOD DISAPPROVES OF THE EAVESDROPPER, SIR, AS DO I. WON'T YOU COME IN? I CANNOT SAY THA I AM GRATEFUL, SIR, BUT I DO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE. - ALLOW ME TO ESCORT YOU TO THE JUDGE. - BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? WELL, THEY'RE GOING TO HANG JUSTINE MORITZ AT NOON. I'M AFRAID NO ONE COULD PROVE HER INNOCENCE. BUT THE LETTER EXPLAINS HER INNOCENCE. THERE IS NOTHING HERE ABOUT JUSTINE. VICTOR WARNS ME THA I MUST LEAVE GENEVA IMMEDIATELY FOR MY SAFETY. WHERE HAS VICTOR GONE? YOU MUST TELL ME, OR JUSTINE WILL DIE. WERNER! LISTEN TO ME. VICTOR'S BROTHER IS ALREADY DEAD. OTHERS HAVE BEEN KILLED, AND MORE WILL FOLLOW UNLESS WE ACT. - VICTOR IS RESPONSIBLE, ELIZABETH! - WHO ARE YOU? WHY WOULD YOU TURN ME AGAINST VICTOR? - WERNER. - I WANT TO HELP HIM, ELIZA-- ELIZABETH. REFERENCE MARY SHELLEY. BORN: MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT GODWIN. MARY SHELLEY. BORN: 1797. DIED: 1851.

[ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Thunderclap ] YOU'LL GET NO HELP FROM ME. [ Frankenstein ] BUCHANAN, IT COULD TAKE ME A FEW DAYS TO ANALYZE THIS MACHINE ON MY OWN. [ Gasping ] PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT? I COULD LET HIM PLAY WITH YOU ALL NIGHT. [ Gasping Continues ] [ Coughing ] SO, CAN YOU MAKE I WORK FOR ME? [ Thunder Rumbling ] I MUST PREPARE. WATCH HIM. [ Computer ] GOOD EVENING, DR. BUCHANAN. MY SENSORS INDICATE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO MY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. SO FORGET THAT. HAVE YOU COMPLETED THE CALCULATIONS I ASKED FOR? YES. ALL PROBABILITIES INDICATE THAT... IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REVERSE A TIME SLIP EFFECT. NOT POSSIBLE? WHY NOT? - TIME SPACE UNBOUND. - COME ON. EXPLAIN YOURSELF. TIME SPACE UNBOUND IS THE LOGICAL OUTCOME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT, DOCTOR. YOU HAVE INTRODUCED A NEW CONDITION INTO THE PHYSICAL WORLD. - WHAT IS THAT? - IT'S A MACHINE THAT THINKS... AND TALKS. WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY OF SURVIVING A LASER-GENERATED IMPLOSION? - DID YOU MAKE IT? - YES. THE PROBABILITY IS HIGH THAT YOU WILL BE TRANSPORTED... TO A NEW PLACE AND TIME. IS IT A MAN? NO, IT IS NOT A MAN. [ Thunderclap ] ARE YOU STRONG ENOUGH... TO CARRY THOSE CABLES... TO THE TOP OF THE BELL TOWER? YES. VICTOR MADE ME VERY STRONG. GOOD BOY. [ Thunderclap ] VICTOR DID NOT MAKE YOU, DID HE? NO. LOOK! CAN YOU CLIMB UP... AND CONNECT THE COIL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CROSS? [ Thunderclap ] [ Thunderclap ] WHO MADE YOU? I DON'T KNOW! GOD, MAYBE! [ Thunderclap ] THROW THIS OVER. NOW THE OTHER ONE. [ Chuckling ] WHO IS GOD MAYBE? I THINK YOU'D BETTER ASK VICTOR ABOUT THAT. YES, I WILL. [ Thunderclap ] [ Thunderclap ] - LOAD LASER IMPLOSION PROGRAM. - LOADING NOW. WHEN YOU GET MAXIMUM POWER, THEN YOU JUST TURN MY LITTLE BABY ON. GOOD-BYE, DR. BUCHANAN. [ Water Bubbling ] [ Thunderclap ] [ Thunderclap ] [ Gasps ] LEAVE HER! [ Thunderclap ] [ Thunderclap ] MY GOD, VICTOR. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? I AM REVERSING A GROSS MISTAKE OF FATE. NO.

STEP AWAY NOW. COME HERE. COME TO ME. [ Crying ] NO. [ Yells ] [ Sobs ] NO! [ Grunting ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunting, Yelling ] [ Bones Cracking ] [ Yells ] [ Sobs ] VICTOR. KILL HIM. [ Exhales ] [ Buchanan's Voice ] THE RUPTURE OF SPACE AND TIME IS SPREADING IN A CHAIN REACTION. WHO KNOWS WHAT EXISTS IN THIS FROZEN TOMORROW? APART FROM HIM, THE ONLY SIGNS OF LIFE IN THIS REMOTE PLACE... ARE REMNANTS OF A FUTURE CIVILIZATION. [ Machinery Beeping, Faint ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Machinery Whirring ] [ Male Computerized Voice ] WELCOME, DR. BUCHANAN. [ Whirring Continues ] [ Whirring Intensifies ] [ Thud ] [ Whirring Stops ] [ Gasps ] THIS WORLD YOU MADE IS BETTER THAN VICTOR'S. IT IS BARREN AS I AM BARREN, LONELY AS I AM ALONE. I DIDN'T CREATE THIS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE ARE. THIS IS THE BRAIN OF THE GREAT CITY BEYOND. THE LAST REFUGE... OF MANKIND. [ Machinery Whirring ] [ Whirring Stops ] [ Whirring Resumes ] [ Growling ] WHAT AM I... THAT YOU MUST... DESTROY ME? AN ABOMINATION IN THE EYES OF GOD. SO WHAT ARE YOU? I AM FRANKENSTEIN.
