Just let it all hang out. Do you believe in that statute in Arizona that says if you get an erection it's a felony or a misdemeanour? You can't go around and expose yourself to everybody. MAN: The welfare system is creating generations of freeloaders. So overexaggerated, welfare. You're worried about a mother of eight. If these are reborn Christians as they claim they are, if they took care of the underprivileged, we wouldn't have a welfare state. Instead of building glass cathedrals, buying TV stations, paying off prostitutes. If Jesus came back today he'd never stop throwing up. Since he's repeatedly talked about his homosexuality on the air, you're very quick, you know? WOMAN: You know what I saw this morning that was real disgusting? Yeah, you saw yourself in a mirror. Why are you listenin' now? You must have a need to be miserable. WOMAN: You don't make me miserable. You see what a hypocrite you're makin' of yourself? You can't enjoy my show, cos you got no sense of humour. Take a hike! - How much did you say you weigh? - 167. That's insane. Your body's supposed to be a temple, a cathedral. You're making it a garbage disposal. Call me up when you lose 50 pounds. Weapons is a big business. We fall for the old patriotic crap. Right now, Iran is the most hated country in the US. We need an enemy so we can make more weapons. In ten years we'll all be driving Iranian cars, the Khomeini wagon, and goin' to chichi Iranian restaurants. Remember what barbarians the Japs were? IRATE MAN: You're always doing all the speaking. 21 minutes remaining in the hour. Hey, people, you know what we're talkin' about tonight? Jew-boys. Anti-Semitism, racism, hate. There's a lotta kike-haters among you nice Gentiles. Let's hear from you. You're not ashamed of what you believe in, are you? This is Kraus. WLD, the voice of the Midwest. 90,000 watts from Chicago. Sickago. Whatever you wanna call it. Hey, you know what, partner? I'm an old Jew myself. Yeah. Show me how brave you are, now. Call up this Jew-boy and we'll talk turkey right after this message. - You're askin' for it tonight, Dan. - Fuck 'em if they can't take it. You hate Jews because they all got syphilis? How do you know that? MALE CALLER: It's in the Bible, in Genesis. Don't tell me about the Bible. You never read it. A TV evangelist quoted you the anti-Semitic parts. Take a walk! Line two, you're on the air. What? WOMAN: I just wanted to say that the Holocaust, that was a big exaggeration. An exaggeration? I mean, there were some Jews killed, but that was just war. - There were a lot of Gis killed too. - What about the gas chambers? WOMAN: All that was, those Jews had to get their lice taken off. - It was like taking 'em to the dry-cleaners. - Did you say dry-cleaners? Uh-huh. You take somethin' to the dry-cleaners, it don't hurt it any. Sometimes it shrinks a little, but you can still wear it. KRAUS: People say "How can you let these guys on the air with all their hate?" Short of inciting a riot, let 'em say what they want, as ugly as it may be. That's a free enterprise of ideas. Bye-bye. - We just about blew the damn board. - Bob, what've we got tomorrow? - Transsexuals. - God bless America. Good night. No! (GUNSHOT) Damn you, son of a bitch. I'll kick the shit outta you. Lighten up, Ronnie. Boy, you got a mouth on you. My boy and me were target shootin'. I guess we forgot all about it. Do you know what somethin' like that would do to my rotor? I didn't think you were gonna cut this section today. - You're supposed to clear these fields. - Ooh, you got a temper too, don't ya? - Maybe. - Where you from, girl? - Texas. - Real cowgirl, huh? Look, I don't need this shit. I'm just trying to do my job. MAN: What do you get if you mix five Mexicans, a Chinaman and five coloured? A water sprinkler that sounds like this. Spic-spic-spic-spic-spic-chink- nigger-nigger-nigger-nigger-nigger. Give me a Colorado Motherfucker. Yes, ma'am. - Ever have a Colorado Motherfucker? - Mm-mm. He's cute. I'm real glad I went back on the pill. Here's your Motherfucker, ma'am. - Taste this. You gotta taste this. - No, thanks. ( COUNTRY-AND-WESTERN SONG) ...backs his car into the window of the bank and dumps the cow on the floor of the lobby, to pay 'em back for what he owes. - You're yankin' my chain. - I'm not. It really happened in Crawford. (MEN LAUGH) - Who is she? - I never seen her before. She must be from the combines. Hey, cowgirl. Buy you a beer. - Got a beer. - Well, I'll buy you another beer. No, thanks. You always like this, or do some folks just bring it out in you? Come on, Texas, let's go out there. We can have one dance, can't we? I'll keep my hands in my pockets and I won't bust your feet. I promise. You can take your hands out of your pockets. Yee-haw! Let's get outta here. - What's your name? - Katie Phillips. I'm Gary. Hi. So, you dance with all the girls who work the combines? Honey, you combine girls are the biggest thing to hit this town. These old boys here, every year about this time, they think it's Santa Claus. - Texas, right? - Texas. It's the first time I've danced in three years. - Right. - Since my wife died. Oh, I'm sorry. And sing of Rosa Lee But the Yellow Rose of Texas beats the belles of Tennessee Old Doc Adams, if he didn't know somethin', he'd tell you it was nerves. These young doctors, in air-conditioned offices, usin' all these big words... They tell you what you got. I liked it better the other way. What is it exactly you do got, Shorty? Haemorrhoids. Howdy, Hank. - I said howdy, Hank. - Howdy. I gotta go. I gotta put my kids to bed. - I'll give you a ride. - I'll just be ridin' with Betty J... I think Betty Jo is gonna need the car. Wayne isn't old enough for a driver's licence yet. Come on. I'll keep my hands in my pockets. You ever seen a man drive with his feet? - You like workin' them combines? - Well, I used to work in a diner. You know, waitin' tips and pushin' their hands away. I miss that guy. You ever listen to that guy? - Radio guy that got killed. - Oh, I just saw about it on the TV. Yeah, well, there ain't nothin' on the radio now, that's for sure. There's rock'n'roll. I hate rock'n'roll. It gives me a headache. I suppose you like rock'n'roll? I hate heavy metal. That gives me a headache. - Hey, we got somethin' in common. - Yeah. Hey! Hello! Hello! - Hi. - Hi. - Daddy said to bring this. I'm Rachel. - Well, thanks, Rachel. Daddy said to ask you to come over to dinner with us tonight. - Excuse me. Dinner? - Grandma's makin' a pot roast. A pot roast? She makes the best pot roast in the whole wide world. - What does she put in it? - Garlic. Garlic? You like garlic? Yep. But if I eat too much, I get diarrhoea. Do you ever get diarrhoea? - I sure try not to. - Is it fun riding up there? - It is. You want a ride? - Sure. - ( CLASSICAL MUSIC ) - You got great music up here. Wait till I tell Joey. He's gonna get red-assed. - Who's Joey? - My brother. - Hi, Shorty. - Hi, Katie. How you doin'? - Good. - Good. - Hi! I stuck my finger in the pot roast. - Ooh, is it good? Great. Grandma, Katie's here. Hi. I'm Gladys. Gary's mom. - Hi. Katie Phillips. - That roast is all ready. I don't know where the fellas are. Probably tendin' to that poor old horse. Sit yourself down. Would you like somethin' to drink? - She likes beer. - Ah. I think I'll join you. It's so darned hot. She never lets me do anything. She still thinks I'm a baby. Our horse is real sick. I hope she'll be OK. Hi, Katie. This is my son Joey. BOTH: Pleasure to meet you. There's the next President. Ain't that a kick in the ass? Is that what you wanna do when you grow up? Oh. I'm announcing my candidacy because it's time for someone to start telling the truth. Who knows? Maybe, huh, Joey? Sit down, please. Get comfortable. - We have to return America... - You can sit here. ...to real Americans. That's the message of the Jack Carpenter candidacy. Well, he's kinda cute. Him? He's a turkey. They're all a bunch of turkeys. (GOBBLES) Hey, thanks, Mom. Just what I wanted. Katie? - I'll get another for myself. - Oh. ...tried and tested in the bureaucratic battlefield in Washington. May I introduce Mr Robert Flynn. - Bob? - Thank you, Jack. Bobby. What this country desperately needs is leadership. And Jack Carpenter is a leader who can put this country back on track. Do you know... (CHOKES) - Excuse me. - That's OK. Do you know him? Nah. Give us your best shot. We expect a lot of your left-Iiberal barbs and we're ready. - I'm really glad you came. - Thanks. You guys... Maybe you oughta wash your hands before dinner or somethin'? Mm. This tastes so good. Do you think I could have some more potatoes? - She's still growin'. Eats like a mule. - Well, she looks growed just fine to me. Me too. - Did you really give her a ride? - I told you he was gonna get red-assed. Young lady, I'm just gonna wash your mouth out with soap. - Daddy says it. - Well, Daddy's a man. Can you give me a ride sometime too? - She's real busy. She got work to do. - Sure I can, Joey. Thanks! Can she ride on the merry-go-round with us tomorrow too? - GARY: Don't know why not, if... - Neato! That's neato! (CLEARS THROAT) Before you excuse yourself, young man, you help Grandma clear the table. We got white cake later, if you want. - Oh, I love white cake. - I do hate those store-bought cakes. All smell of the Cellophane they're wrapped in. I always bake my cakes from scratch. No matter if anybody else does. - Not just cake, but everything's changing. - Don't get yourself all riled up, Mom. - You know it ain't right. - You know I know it, Mom. It just ain't the same country I grew up in, that's all. The bad just pushes out the good. - There's filth and trash everyplace. - Mom. Sorry. I'll just go and get my white cake. Well, it's hard around here. Old people losing their past. Young people losing their farms. - Nobody does anything about it. - I know. I grew up in a town just like this. - Was that picture taken in... - Oh. - Mom, I asked you not to put this out. - Well, I like it. Hey, this is the best white cake in the whole white world, isn't it? - You hush. - It is. ( BAND MUSIC ) (SCREAMING) (SQUEALS) Yeah! - No, more, Dad! - Aaah! Yes! KATIE: Oh, let's go by Uncle Sam. - GARY: I'll take one of you guys together. - OK, smile. Smile! Great. - Here you are, darlin'. - Oh, wait, Shorty. Let me get your picture. You taste these, you're gonna leave this big ugly thing for me. - How long you been drivin' combines? - It's just only my first year. - Do you like it? - I like travellin' around meetin' people. - But I don't like the motels much. - I can understand that. - Thank you. - Hey, Lyle. You know Katie? - Yeah. - Lyle went way back with my dad. There was a real man for you. He could eat a bear for breakfast and shit bullets. How do you know he shit bullets, Lyle? - Your mouth full of obscenities again? - Hiya, Reverend. - Hey, I got somethin' for you, Reverend. - Hey! There's the old quarterback. Hey, Gary! When the hell are we gonna go huntin'? I'm gettin' rusty. I don't know, Buster, but I'll let you know. - You ever been huntin'? - When I was young, my daddy took me. I got cherry bombs, snappin' crackers and big nukes. Hellfire, Buster, you got enough stuff there to blow up the town on the Fourth of July. Government's found a new way to put the farmers back on their feet. - How's that, Shorty? - It's gonna take away the pick-ups. Say, why are you taking all the pictures? I always take a lot of pictures. I got a whole album of 'em at home. What is the matter with you, Wes? Scared your face is gonna bust the camera? (SCREAMS OF DELIGHT) (CROWD SINGS "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL") - You ain't gonna invite me in, are you? - No. It ain't time yet, is it? Well, you better go in, or else I'm gonna end up making your bed or somethin'. Hey, girl. Happy Independence Day. (PHONE) Hello. Yes. They're all in the barn. It's Beauty. She's too sick. Daddy said we're gonna have to put her to sleep. Please, Dad, we don't have to. She'll be OK. She'll be all right, Dad. - Katie, tell him, please. Katie, tell him! - I can't watch it. (GUNSHOT) I gotta go. My mama's gonna have an operation. I just got a call. - When are you comin' back? - Couple of days. I can't get any work done anyway. It's gonna take a while for it to dry out. - Where are you goin'? - Her mom's sick. She's goin' home. - Ain't you gonna give me my ride? - Sure she is, Joey. - You promise? - I promise. I'm sorry about Beauty, Gary. Katie, we'll be waitin' for you. Weaver. Put your tag on, Miss Weaver. - ...his, uh, his father. - No, please. You say no, but we all do. Gary Simmons's father, sir. His father joined the Sons of Liberty in 1978. He refused to pay his taxes. The IRS went after him. They put a lien on his farm. His father hung himself. His wife divorced him, moved to California. She was killed in a hit-and-run accident. The driver was never apprehended. Her body was so badly bruised, we believe the driver reversed and drove over her again. Can we put him out in California at the time? We are still working on it. He almost won the Medal of Honor when he ran into a VC bunker and killed five Vietcong after being wounded. He did win a medal for being wounded. - He did win a medal for a wound. - What did you find, Weaver? She hasn't found anything yet, sir, but we're still... I don't believe there is anything to find. I'm afraid I'm being sent on a wild-goose chase. A car like his was seen speeding away from Kraus's garage. A half-drunk witness identified two digits in a licence plate in a car similar to his. All right. Now, whose side are you on, anyway? His? Don't start that shit with me, Michael. My loyalties are perfectly intact. No one mentioned your loyalties, but we've heard a lot about his family, his fondness for white cake, his fondness for horses... Hey, what are we doing here? Are we targeting him? - On what basis? - On my gut's basis, OK? I've a very sensitive gut. Comes from a long-time-standing proximity to certain erogenous zones. What about the Chicago PD? What are they coming up with? - Marty? - We got over 100 people on the case, sir. We got nothin'. As far as we're concerned, Gary Simmons is a real long shot. See any guns? Duffin, they got more guns in that part of the country than people. If you're talkin' about Mac-10s, no. Look, Kraus was a lightning rod. - Anyone with a radio coulda killed him. - So Gary's got a radio, right? Dog-lovers, left-wingers, right-wingers. Anyone coulda done it. You skipped the fat ladies. You wanna know what my gut instinct is? - The fat ladies got him. - They certainly had cause. Let me know what you decide. That's his ex-wife. OK, guys, that'll do it for today, thanks. - I think what you're doing is great. - Thank you. - Al Sanders, in from DC. - Nice to meet you. Catherine Weaver, first time undercover, acting like 16-year-old on first date. - I love 16-year-olds. - You're sick, Duffin. All you yuppies are sick. Anyway, it's nice to see ya. I missed you. - You look great. - Thanks, Michael. - Well, I always did like this view. - Oh, Michael, you really piss me off. - Good. We still feel the same. - No, we don't. Come on over here. I really, really did miss you. The Reverend. Wes. Shorty. And Dean, he's the sheriff's deputy. And the guy is a war hero. - Are you gonna hold all that against him? - Not in the '80s. It's back in style. Gary's no more violent or racist than anyone up here. - What does that mean? - It means they tell black jokes. Whaddaya got on this guy? It's a beautiful baby, don't you think? - What about ZOG? - What'd you expect, Michael? That I'd see "ZOG" painted on the side of the barn next to "Duane loves Mary"? Who's Duane? Think there's any reason to consistently muddied licence plates? Yes. When it rains, farm fields get muddy. He smells too good. He's the kind of guy who needs an Alamo to defend. - He's perfect for the part. - We want him to be perfect for the part. He's a good-looking guy, right, Cathy? You want something? I'll give you something. - He named his dog after Ronald Reagan. - Well, he ain't all bad. (CHILDREN PLAYING) - Hi. Hi, Catherine. - Hi, Jasper. Your mother had her operation in St Joseph's Hospital in Dallas. She's in room 320. Her name is Emma. She'll be home in a week in Wells. We'll have an agent there. Your home phone number is 214-817-1701. Memorise that. If you need me, I can be there in 1 hours. You're paranoid. I didn't recruit you off that campus to lose you now. You already lost me. I thought maybe you were gonna ask me up. - Let it go. - I don't want to. I do. Don't you think you like this guy just a little bit too much? I like him. Ain't that the shits, huh? It is, where I come from. I like you too. - What's your mother's phone number? - 214-817-1702. - 01. - 01. Rachel! Joey! Hello? Rachel? They've all gone to church! REVEREND: We are mugged on our streets, and our neighbours are afraid to help us. Our children's minds are poisoned with filth. And our judges are afraid to cast that filth into the fires of righteousness! Our schools can teach that we come from apes, but can't teach that we are created by God. - How's your mom? - She's fine. Our cities are dying of sexual disease. - CONGREGATION: Amen. - Amen. The Lord's wrath comes down on those who live by promiscuity and perversion! Amen. Listen to me, Americans. We are the true descendants of the lost tribes of Israel. We are God's chosen people! We are the sons of Abel. We must awaken. The time is comin'. A long-forgotten wind is starting to blow. ALL: Amen. GARY: Right behind you, Grandma. He preaches with the devil's own pitchfork. - The devil hasn't got a pitchfork. - How do you know? You seen him? - A pitchfork. - Hold on. I got somethin' for ya. You gonna come to Grandma's for dinner? We're gonna watch a cowboy movie. Daddy loves cowboy movies. - You will come, won't you? - Well, I gotta go check the fields. What for? They're still wet even with this wind. You ain't gonna be weed-whackin' today. Why don't you guys ride home with Grandma? We'll go get the beer. I love your family. It's sweet of you to say that, Katie. You know what? I do too. What are we doing? I think we're lookin' for beer. No. Go slow. And take off your watch. That's the first time since my wife died. How did she die? Oh, she left me. She went out to California. She got hit by a car. Maybe it was that goddamn war. Maybe I worked the farm too hard. Maybe I didn't pay enough attention to her. Maybe she read too many magazines. It was my fault. But I learned from it. RACHEL: I don't wanna play Zog! I wanna play dolly! JOEY: You always wanna play dolly! - No, I don't! - Yes, you do! I don't wanna play dolly! I wanna play Zog! No! Stay here and play dolly with me! It's real easy. Here, take one. - I wanna play with my dolls. - What are you playin'? - He never wants to play dolly. - What do you wanna play? - I don't like dolls. - What's Zog? - I don't know. - Come on. Dog. It's a game. I'm the dog. She's the cat. It's real dumb. - Morning. - Morning. - Didn't you sleep good? - No, I slept OK. Can you take me on the ride on the combine now? - Sure. - Hot shit, Dad, we're goin' on a ride! After breakfast. Hey, you wanna go huntin' with us tonight? - I'm truly tired. - I'd really like you to come. It's important. Can I go huntin', Dad, please? - Maybe when you're bigger. - I'm big, Dad. Yeah. Goddamn, it's hot today. Maybe we oughta look for some beer later on. OK. GARY: Goddamn grain elevator. It's always breakin' down. They get the parts in Aba Dabba or some goddamn Arab place. Get the parts in Aba Dabba, send the wheat to Russia, feed the commies, so they can sell the goddamn equipment to the Aba Dabbas, so they can turn around and sell it to us, so we can sit here and goddamn boil ourselves to death. I sure as goddamn shit don't get it. Goddamn it, Elmer! What the goddamn shit is goin' on? Coke machine works. Least anyways they don't make that in Aba Dabba. I don't think. Aw! - When we goin' huntin'? - Told you. I don't like huntin'. Hey, you'll like this. How you doin', Del? Have a good crop this year? Had a pretty good crop myself. How 'bout you? I'm talkin' to ya, Del. I'm talkin', Del. One neighbour to another. Chewin' the shit, that's all. - I ain't heard you give me no answer, Del. - You ain't no neighbour of mine. Come on, Gary. We don't want no trouble. We're just waitin'. - What's that spot on your face, Jud? - That's a birthmark, Gary. Yeah? You sure about that, Jud? It ain't one of them spots you get from that there AIDS, is it, Jud? You ain't been airin' your back door like one of them dyin', spotted faggots? - You son of a bitch. - Don't fuck with me, Jud. You hear me, Del? You hear me, Del? What'd you do that for? I ain't the one who started it all. It ain't no big deal anyhow. Some people here just don't like me. Katie... I'm gonna get down on my hands and knees, right here, with all them lookin', unless you come huntin' with me. You know that, don't you? Yes, I am. All right. I'll go huntin'. - You're coming? - Yeah, I'm coming. OK. I've never been huntin' at night. Ah, it's gonna be a real mud hunt tonight. - What are we huntin'? Deer? - It ain't deer season. Come on. - Shorty. - Hi, Gary. Come on. Watch your step. It's slippery. All of you know Katie. - Hi, Katie. - Give me a weapon, Shorty. All right, Gary. Right here. Gimme another one, Shorty. And a clip. This is a Mac-10 fully automatic machine pistol. - You pull this trigger here. - She ain't got no place here. - Shut up. - Here, Gary. Thanks. You know what this is. Pop that in. Here's your magazine release. Pull this baby back, you got one up the snout, ready to go. - You ain't goin' huntin' with that. - Oh yeah, we are. Shut up. Sorry we're late, Shorty. Cocked and ready. Here y'are, boy. You'd better start runnin'. You got ten bullets. - And 30 seconds. - You'd better run, nigger. - We're gonna get some black stuff. - OK, let's do it. - Come on. - No. I love you. I gotta be honest with you. You gotta know everything. It's just training. It's your first hunt. You'll get used to it. Come on. All right. Don't stand around in a cluster fuck. Fan out. - (TWO GUNSHOTS) - (DOG HOWLS) Goddamn it, he shot Duke! I said spread out over there, goddamn it. Don't group up. Get some of them lights out. Goddamn him to fuckin' hell! He shot Duke! OK, get up, Buster. Come on. Move it, Buster! I'm gonna kill that fuckin' nigger. (SEVERAL GUNSHOTS) - Hey, Shorty, it's Bambi! - Don't shoot at it! Come on, goddamn it. Don't group up! Come on. Put some of them lights out. Gary! He's over here! You bastard, I'll kill you! You bastard! He's got six left! Better make it a good one, Satchmo! Yee-haw! What's the matter? We're not a big enough target for you? That's six, nigger. You got four left. (GUNSHOT) You got two left, boy! - We're losin' him! - Goddamn, you missed him! Come on, lighten up. - Hey, Gary. Looky here. His gun. - Oh, this ain't gonna take much longer. KATIE: He's wounded. Your fucking game is over. Shit. Rain. Come on. Hey, Gary, over here! Hell, boy, my baby sister shoots better than you do. Got us a coon in a trap. It's your first time, right? So let her do it. First one, Katie. It's your kill. Go get him. You can do it, Katie. Walk up there, point your weapon, pull the trigger. Don't kill me. - Don't even think about it, Wes! - Gary, she knows. It don't matter! Finish him off! - (GUNSHOT) - No! - No! - (GUNSHOT) We'll get you somethin' to warm you up when we get home. Just take me to the motel. Aw, come on, Katie. Come on, now. It was just a nigger. There's plenty more where he came from. I didn't want there to be anything between us. I love you that much. If you love me, I got nothin' to worry about. But if you don't, I don't care about goin' to jail. But one thing's for sure, we're gonna kick the hell outta Zog. Who's Zog? Zionist Occupation Government. It means the goddamn Jews are runnin' our country with their nigger police. (SOBS) (WAILS) Michael. Where the fuck are you goin', sugar? - (ENGINE REVS) - Hey! Cunt! Oh. Just hold me. Just hold me real hard. Oh. You're sure nobody followed you? We'll never find the body, Cathy. I can testify. I was there. I saw everything. - I just didn't do anything. - There wasn't anything you could do. They're guilty. You're not. - It wasn't the first hunt they were on. - No shit. We'll never find the bodies, Cathy. I want them for Kraus. We have a body there. We can put them away for ever. - You have to go back in. - No, I can't go back in. I need you to link them with Kraus. You're the only one who can do it. How could I even look at him again? How could I let him touch me? I feel dirty. I feel so dirty. I never said you had to sleep with him, did I? Did I? How could you have? I thought... Why?! I didn't sleep with him. I made love to him. - What the hell difference does it make?! - SANDERS: Take it easy, Mike. Look, I'm in too deep, Michael. Maybe my loyalties are all screwed up. I'm off balance. That would be a convenient excuse for you, wouldn't it? You have to go back in. You just want me to go back in to punish me. No. You feel dirty? What's more important? Putting them behind bars? How many others do you think they're gonna kill? And how dirty do you think you'd feel if you didn't do anything about it? I just don't know how I could have been so wrong. How I let him... If you could see him with his family. Yeah, well, I don't know. I guess your gut instinct's just really not that good, right? Now you know. Don't go along too easily. Make their garbage look new to you. Play it normal. Don't be too quick to convert. You don't want him to think that you're an easy lay, do you? About Wes. Wesley John Bond, paroled from San Quentin three years ago. He headed up a racist group called the Aryan Brotherhood in the joint. He has a sheet going back 15 years, all of it in California. Forcible rape, sodomy, aggravated assault. And he tried to be a mercenary in South Africa. Yeah, I just wish I knew how he wound up here. - Shit floats. - Well, stay away from Wes. He's a freak's freak, and Gary's using him. We've got nothing on the others. They seem like losers. You know, if I was Gary, I'd like losers. I bet Gary likes losers. Treat losers right, they make good soldiers. I learned it in the Marines. I learned it in the FBI. - Take it. - If he finds it, I'm dead. Make sure he doesn't find it. You're just doing a job. That's all it is. - Hey, Theresa. - Hello, Katie. Mornin'. Where you been? I drove. I went past the Interstate. I came back. Did you come back for your stuff? It's over there. No. Katie, you come back cos you love me? Cos if you do, I need to know. Say it. Please say it. I love you. Combines are leavin'. So? You're stayin'. Well, I guess it's sad to see your friends leavin'. You got a place now. What'd you kill him for? Just for the fun of it? It ain't fun killin' anything. It was self-defence. He had a gun. We were protectin' ourselves. All we're tryin' to do is protect ourselves. Self-defence. I don't like killin' anybody. - I don't like people hurt. - They ain't people. They're mud people. You know, with you helpin' with the farm and the kids, I think we got a chance at a real family again. Well, there's plenty of space. And, Katie, there's a closet here ain't got nothin' in it. I only got the one suitcase, Gary. Oh, yeah. Uh... I changed this around after my wife died. Ain't been anybody here since. Anyway, I want you to feel like it's home, OK? Hey, guys. Katie's gonna be stayin' with us from now on. - Are you gonna be our mommy? - Mom's dead. I don't care. I don't hardly even remember her. - I do. - GLADYS: Rachel! Joey! Uh, comin', Mom! - Katie's gonna move in. - Is she? Can you talk to her? Smooth it over? Just be nice. Just be nice, OK? Can I help you in the kitchen, Mrs Simmons? He's been hurt once. I don't want him hurt again. I'm not gonna hurt him. Will you cut this shit? You been drinkin'? We'll wait another day and see. This ain't your business. It's mine. Katie. Katie? Rachel? Aren't you gonna give me a good-night kiss? All right. In a minute. You go upstairs. - I'll give you a hand. - Well, I'm almost done. "Wash and dry together, laugh and cry together." My mama always says that. What was that all about? - What? - With Wes. Oh. Well, it seems old Wes thinks you're a grasshopper. Grasshopper? He is weird. Do I look like a grasshopper? No, no, no. The kinda grasshopper that's gettin' in people's hair all the time. Like the FBI, CIA. KGB, JDL, NAACP... that kinda grasshopper. - I'm a what? - So, are you a grasshopper? Shit, yeah. I'm gonna go kiss the kids good night. Get in. Come on. Good night, Rachel. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Good night, Katie. Daddy said we don't have to have no secrets no more. - What secrets? - About the niggers and the rabbis. - And the race traitors. - And Zog. They're the sons of Cain. Rachel, do you know what a rabbi is? - You know. - He's got a big, dirty beard. - With lice in it. - And he does it to little kids. Niggers do it too. They do it in the back, in the butt. JOEY: That's gross. We're the good guys. One day, we'll kill all the dirty niggers and the Jews, and everything's gonna be neat. Do you know what a cow kiss is? (RACHEL GIGGLES) Turn out your light, Joey. COMPUTER VOICE: Will do. Will do. - You done already? - Um, I was just watching you. Well, come on, I'll show you. - You know anything about computers? - No. Just games and stuff like that. Yeah. Well, I can talk to anybody I want. We have systems operators all over the country. COMPUTER VOICE: Welcome to the American Liberty Network. - Oh, wow. - It talks too. Neat, huh? My dad, when I was a kid, told me "No amount of carrying on is gonna make the wheat grow faster." "Don't rock the boat." He changed his mind later on. We're gonna rock this goddamn boat. Oh, we'll kill the old red rooster when she comes... hack, hack! Oh, we'll kill the old red rooster when she comes... hack, hack! Oh, we'll kill the old red rooster Oh, we'll kill the old red rooster Oh, we'll kill the old red rooster when she comes Hack, hack!

Well, check it once in a while. - KATIE: I thought we were goin' campin'. - We are. (CROWD SINGS "AMAZING GRACE") - Hey, everybody. - Hi, Gary. - I gotta get these kids fed. - Toby made a big pot of stew. - Great, Ellie. Go to the table. - Hi. Hi, Katie. (JOINING IN SING-ALONG) You guys eat and hurry up and get to sleep. - Can't I stay up a little? - No, you cannot stay up. Goddamn, that's good beef stew, Toby. She can bake a cherry pie Quick as a cat can wink his eye She's a young girl who cannot leave her mother They're waitin' for you down at the trailer, Gary. I'll be along, Wes. - Hey, Shorty. Where's Gary? - Oh, he'll be back in a minute. Come on out here. Sit down and warm your toes. Gets kinda nippy up here. - I just got the kids to sleep. - You're real good with them. They're nice kids. - Where'd everybody go, anyway? - Oh, visitin' friends, puttin' kids to bed. I'm kinda the old watchdog here. How do you feel about this? It's all kinda new to me, you know? I never really known any Jews or niggers before. - I don't like hurtin' people. - Well, I don't either. I don't even like seein' a fight. But, if we don't fight back, they'll take it all away from us, the whole country. Jew-boy judges, and bankers, and politicians with their nigger police, and Orientals. - All of these people with guns. - I know. I don't like it either. Hell, I have to close my eyes every time I pull the trigger. You got a good heart, Katie. There's nothing wrong with that. But you learn. You gotta do what's gotta be done. I learned too. All I ever wanted was just to raise my crops and raise my boy. The bank took my farm and Vietnam took my son. I got nothin' left to take. I ain't in this for myself, either. I got a good heart too, Katie, just like you. - What are you doin' up? - I can't sleep. I got the hiccups. You do? Boo! I'll lay down with you. Good night, Shorty. Good night, Katie. Good night, sweetheart. (SINGING CONTINUES) Hey, hey, blue Come on, blue Come on outta there, lazy. - Oh, it's nice here. - Yeah. I bet you're hungry, too. - Yeah. - Well, we got breakfast. TANNOY: Bob Daniels, Chattanooga, you're wanted at the registration desk. Hey, Lyle! (ALL CALL OUT IN UNISON) Have a nice day, Lyle! I done told you not to say that to me! - (LAUGHTER) - Ah! Lyle thinks "Have a nice day" is a Jewish plot to put us all to sleep. - Can we play ball now, Dad? - What are you doin'? You got school. - Wes, help me out. - Let's go, you monkeys! School time. Go, go. (IMITATES MACHINE GUN) (RACHEL GIGGLES) How sweet. - (GUNSHOTS) - There they are, over there. - This is school? - Yeah. (GUNSHOTS) - Very good. - How's she doin'? She's doin' great, Gary. She's a better shot than you are. Isn't that great? This scratches. This doesn't feel good. No, it doesn't, does it? - Freeze! - Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut. - Freeze! - Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut. Freeze! Target! Shoot! Pay attention to the target. Site it. Just a little bit below the target. Take a deep breath. Oh, Jesus, Katie. What'd you do? Close your eyes? - I guess so. - Concentrate. Get that Jew-boy right in the eye. Holy shit. - Beginner's luck. - You was connin' me. Hey, Gary! Gary, we got Lugers. - Look at this. - This boy's got original Lugers for sale. - Get outta here. - What did you say, brother? My dad got a Purple Heart fightin' uniforms like that and your Adolf Hitler. I don't wanna hear about it. Get outta here. Go jack off with your Lugers. - Oh, Jesus. - What'd you do that for? Because they're assholes and they're losers. You're an asshole too, Lyle. We got more assholes here than they got in California. California? He's from Oshkosh, Wisconsin. That's Johnson. I put $50 down on that gun. What the hell'd he mean by that? Why'd he call me an asshole for? Beats the shit outta me, Lyle. WES: Hey, Gary. Gary. The stuff is here. Wake up, man. OK. Yeah, they wouldn't give it to me, man. They didn't trust me. - They got what we want? - They got a whole truckload of shit. (GROUP SINGING "MICHAEL ROW THE BOAT ASHORE") - Look out for the bear, Wes. - Fuck you. (LAUGHTER) Don't worry about them bears. It's them wolverines. - A wolverine'll kick the piss out of a bear. - Is that right? Come on, Wes. It's probably somebody sneakin' out to take a crap. I heard somethin'. - Gettin' jumpy, Wes? - (GUNSHOTS) (SPORTS ANNOUNCER OVER RADIO) SHORTY: This old blue-gummed nigger gets to heaven. St Pete's there. Yeah, sure, Shorty. I gotta go. I saw you. I saw you, cunt. - What the fuck... - She was out in the woods, Gary. - What the fuck you doin'? - She was out in the fuckin' woods. SHORTY: I've been sittin' by this fire all night. - GARY: You touch her, I'll kill you. - I tell you, she was out there. GARY: Go get Dean and Buster. We gotta talk. In your tent. - Where? - New York, San Francisco, LA, - Miami, Chicago, Atlanta. - When? - Three days after the hit. - When's the hit? I'll let you know. No, you cannot have another rock. That's it with the rocks. Good morning, everybody. My name's Jack Carpenter and I'd like to be your man in Washington. We're running a campaign here to return America to real Americans. - Hey, isn't that your friend? - CARPENTER: So let's get organised. (CROWD CHEERS) Unless you want the Jews, niggers and faggots to keep on telling you what to do. Course, you know it's gonna take some financin'. - God. Look at him. - We got some donation pledge cards. You can sign and put it on your credit card. Don't give me anything, unless you can afford it. - I mean that, now. - No, you don't. You don't care if they can afford it or not. All you care about is buyin' yourself another Cadillac. - Or maybe a new fancy suit. - Who are you, mister? - Whose side are you on? - Come on, now, Gary. - We're all on the same side here. - I ain't on his side. You think you're gonna win, Mr Big Shot? You ain't got a prayer, pal. You're just in it for the ride. Well, you ain't ridin' on my back. All you're doin' is distractin' people here. - Maybe that's what you wanna do. - I'll talk to him. A boy with your speakin' talents, maybe you oughta be runnin' instead of me. I ain't real sure which one of us is the politician, friend. - Fuck you. - You gotta clean up your speakin' style. Jesus Christ, Bobby. You had to go and hitch your wagon to him? What the fuck did you do that for, Bobby? Why, man? Why? What did I keep tellin' you back in Nam? I said you're the best point man I ever saw, but stick to that. Don't do nothin' else. You leave the formations to me. But look at him. There ain't nothin' inside. And what'll you do when the shit hits the fan? When he starts stealin' money or dickin' some jailbait. CARPENTER: I'm proud to sign your Bible. This is our cement! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) This is the only constitution we'll ever need. All right! God, look at him. He's gonna ruin everything for us. Do you think I'd ever let him do that? (SPEECH CONTINUES) I ain't never gonna let nobody do that. You hear me, point? You hear me? Yeah, I hear you, Bobby. I hear you. Hey, I'm the best point man you ever saw, right? The war's over now, isn't it, Gary? - The fuck it is, Bobby. - The fuck it is. I know what I'm doin'. I always did set up a hell of a formation, didn't I? Yeah, you always did, Bobby. That's why you should be head of the whole damn thing. Carpenter is a straw man. He's not into murder. He's into upward mobility. Gary's right. You're talking New York, LA, Chicago, San Francisco, Miami and Atlanta? Three days after the hit. That's all I heard. Hit? Hit who? Hit what? What the hell's goin' on, huh? Hits, mortars, submachine guns, enough of 'em to outfit a goddamn division. And still nothing about Kraus? What do you want me to do? Walk up and ask him if he killed Kraus? Nobody wants you to do that. Hell, yes, they killed Kraus. That's how we get 'em. The rest is chickenshit. They'll be off in a year with good behaviour. - Wes knows. - Wes knows what? - About me. - He can't. How could he know? Michael, he knows! He's been all over me. He's a nutcake. It's probably his way of showing affection. Here. I found these. They belong to his gun. Nine millimetre. Mac-10. - She's got to prove herself to them. - She has. They trust her. - Whaddaya want me to do, kill someone? - Hope you won't have to. I didn't join up to kill anyone. Michael, you promised me that I wouldn't get dirty. You were using me. You're still using me. You're lettin' me use you. SANDERS: Everybody uses everybody, girl. It's just a matter of what you're being used for. What it is... is the only important thing. Michael, they could be anywhere. We'll find you a safe home, house, place, whatever. You'll be all right. RACHEL: Katie's here! Katie's back! - Where you been all day? - I went to the mall. All day? I don't have to tell you how long I'll be gone. - Hey, kids, go get some napkins. - I'll get the beer. - You quit crowdin' me. - You're a fuckin' wildcat, aren't you? What were you doin' at the mall all day? Shoppin'. Yeah? Anything for me? Maybe. Maybe it's a surprise. - Let me see. - Look what you did. - What? - You put the forks in the wrong place. Daddy, the forks go on the left side. What are you doin'? Where's my surprise? Just a minute. COMPUTER VOICE: Liaison completed. Assignments completed. Liaison completed. Ta-dah You don't have to dress like a ten-dollar whore for me. You look like a whore. I'm not a whore. Then why do you dress like one? (KATIE SOBS) Katie, I'm sorry. It's just that I got a lot of pressure on me. I got a real big job to do next week. We'll park the van here on Madison Street. - What about the others? - We'll meet them at Navy Pier. And they'll be ready. We go in like Wild Bill Hickok and stick 'em up. And maybe we ain't gonna have to shoot anybody. - And what if we do? - Then we do. She ain't gonna shoot nobody. - She will if she has to. - No, she won't. - You scared? - Why do you want me to go in? - You got a better eye than I do. - That ain't the reason. Reason enough. I'm gonna go get the kids. - Mom's gonna bring 'em. - Well, I'll save her the trouble. (TELEVISION) - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Daddy. - Who'd you call? - When? Who'd you call on the way to Mom's? You followed me? Is that what you did? Who the fuck did you call?! Go on! Get up to your rooms! I called your mother. I told her I was comin'. Mom? Did Katie call you before she picked up the kids? Yeah, she called and said for me to get them ready. TV: ...to investigate presidential candidate Jack Carpenter for alleged misappropriation of campaign funds. Thanks, Mom. Oh, boy. Yes, I've heard the reports. No, I'm not concerned. I think this shows that some people are being made very nervous by my candidacy. What do you need me for? I should keep the car running. It's a little late for that crap now. You're goin'. - You boys know Chicago? - I'm from Boston. - Not me. I'm from Tallahassee. - Let's go! - We know Chicago, don't we, Shorty? - Sure do. - Wesley? (LAUGHS) - What's so funny? Ah, just thinkin'. My great-grandaddy used to rob stagecoaches. No shit? My great-grandaddy was the town marshal. My grandfather owned a bank. I manage a bank myself. The wind is startin' to blow. You're gonna wanna zip that up. It's a bulletproof vest. (SCREAMS) Good morning! We rob banks! - Lay on the ground. - Get on the floor! - Get on the floor! Get over here! - Listen up! - Don't move! Get on the ground! - You two, get over there! You blink your eyes and I'll blow your goddamn head off! We don't want any heroes today! I mean that! (BABY GURGLES) - GARY: What happened? - WES: It's all right. Nice shot. Katie, come on. Thank you, everybody. Have a nice day! (ALARM GOES OFF) (SHOUTING ABUSE) Shit. Shut the fuck up! You call yourself a cop? You fucked... Shut up! When you get on Lake Shore Drive, hang a left. - (WES HOWLS WITH PAIN) - Shut up! KATIE: Take him out. Shut the fuck up! Call yourself a fucking cop? - SHORTY: About four blocks! - GARY: All right. - Watch your speed. - I'm goin' slow. Don't worry about it. (WES CRIES OUT) GARY: Shut up! He's dead. Katie, come on, let's go. Why don't you drive home? I'll see you tomorrow. Shorty and I will take care of Wes. You did real good. I don't understand. There was only supposed to be three guards in that bank. - Michael, I... I shot a guard. - He was gonna kill you. - It was self-defence. - He was an innocent. He was caught in a crossfire. We didn't know he'd be there. I'm sorry. You're sorry? Where were you? - We decided to let it happen. - Great, without telling me. We couldn't contact you. We don't want 'em for bank robbery. We wanna know how they'll use the money. They netted 3.2 million on four bank heists across the country. They're buildin' some kind of a war chest. - And what about Wes? - What about him? You said he was onto ya. I took him out. Didn't wanna risk it. Oh, you did it for me. Yes, I did it for you. And the world's a better place. Look, Michael. Just forget it. I've had it. You've had enough, huh? That's it. Another job half done. Kinda like the dcor here, your stint with the Peace Corps, our relationship. - You never cared about us. - I care a great deal about you, Cathy. - No, you don't. - You ended us, not me. That was self-defence. The guard's OK. He's out of danger. She's troubled about killing old Wes. How do you feel about droppin' that piece of shit, Al? Terrific. Like cleaning something off my shoe. Katie! Katie! I missed you. I didn't think you were ever coming back. I always think about you, Rachel. I love you. - A whole big bunch? - A whole big bunch. - Are you all alone? - Joey's in his room. Rachel... Remember you said we didn't have to have secrets any more? Yeah, and I told you about the Jews and the niggers and the sons of Cain. Do you still think it's right to hurt other people? What about all those little girls whose daddies have black skin? Don't you think they love their daddies just as much as you do? In America we can do anything we want, except hurt other people. - Can I tell Daddy? - No, this'll be our secret. Best friends always have secrets. - I don't have a best friend. - Neither do I. And I need one. - Me too. - Do you know what a cow kiss is? RACHEL: I showed you what it was. (DOOR OPENS) Daddy's here. You don't need me any more. Hi. Oh, I know it's rough the first time. I know that. But, Katie, whew, you were so relaxed when... bam! - Girl, you got the instinct. - No! - Yeah, you do. I know you. - No, I don't. What did we do it for? - What? - What did we rob a bank for? What did Wes die for? What did I shoot somebody for? You're upset. I understand that. OK, listen. You tell me. Who's that money for? Friends of ours. What friends? Friends. The devil's right hand, The devil's right hand My mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand - No smooching. - That's gross. I love this place. You know, it could be so good again for them. Like it was for me when I was a little kid. We're gonna make it good for 'em again, ain't we, Katie? Ain't we? - Huh? - Yeah, Gary. Yeah. Oh, yes, we are. Marry me. Will you marry me? Ah, you don't have to answer me right now. That's the power plant there. They got three guards, 24 hours a day. Our boys back East will knock that out. Kill all the lights in Jew York City. What the hell's that gonna prove? They got ten guys dressed as cops who are gonna go into Harlem and shoot the niggers. Hot damn. That's what I'm gonna do. That is fun. - What do you wanna do, Dean? - I wanna go to Harlem. Niggers are gonna riot. They think this country's theirs. But we're gonna show 'em it ain't. In San Francisco, we're gonna kill some faggots. And in Chicago... Sickago, we're gonna put four loads of dynamite in the courthouse. Mother of shit! This country ain't gonna know what the fuck happened. - What about the hit? - We do that three days before. - That's what sets it off. - Who's the target? Who's gonna do it, Gary? Me and you. - I went for a drive. - I didn't ask where you'd been. Yes. Yes? Yes? Yes? Whoo! Come on, let's call Mom. - What's her number? - My mom? - Yeah. - 214... 817-1701. Mrs Phillips? Yeah. Hold on, please. Hi, Mom? I'm gettin' married. No, I'm not kiddin'. - No, it's... it's true. Yeah. - Gimme that. - Mrs Phillips? - Call her Emma. Uh, Emma. Yeah. Hi. I'm Gary Simmons. And I'm the lucky guy. Well, when are we gonna do it, Katie? Do what? Do what? When are we gonna get married?! - Shh. The kids are sleeping. - Oh, they're OK. How about tomorrow? Well, I gotta wait till my mama gets better. Aw, the hell with your mama. I wanna get married now. - What about that thing we gotta do? - Oh. Well, there ain't nothin' to that. It's so easy. You wanna see how easy it is? I'll show you how easy it is. All these names? Look at 'em. They're all friends of ours. High-up friends, low-down friends, all helpin' us, lookin' out for us. We can hit a thousand people and it ain't nothin'. - Hey, what are you gonna wear? - What? Come on, Katie, what kinda wedding dress are you gonna wear? Marry in blue, your guy'll be true. - Marry in brown, you'll live in town. - Marry in green, ashamed to be seen. Marry in yellow, you got the right fellow. Marry in grey, be sad someday. Marry in white, it'll be all right. You're so pretty. You smell like a horse. (GARY LAUGHS) You're never gonna turn against me, are you? No. She couldn't go along with me. She got pregnant. Had an abortion. She killed my baby. She said she'd rather kill it than... She tried to turn the kids against me. She ran away from me. Writin' them and callin' them behind my back. I had to share my life with you. All of it. I couldn't go through all that again. You gotta be with me every step of the way. I didn't have no choice with her. Who killed her? Wes. I'm all alone in there. Can I sleep in here? Oh, Rachel, not again. (HORSE NEIGHS) (MEN LAUGH) Michael? (SCREAMS) Where have you been? I've been here two hours. - We got held up. - You don't get held up! This is my life! What do we have, Cathy? So we got some photos of Kraus with a black X mark over his face? What does that prove? If we bust them for the bank robbery, what about these people? Somebody else'll pull the trigger. We're almost there. All we need is the name. Ted Kennedy, Jesse Jackson, Coleman Young, Howard Metzenbaum, Kissinger. Myroff. Myroff is an investigative reporter from Louisville. Terry Sheridan. Terry Sheridan is a linebacker for the Miami Dolphins. We can't possibly protect these people for God knows how long. What are they supposed to do? Crawl into a room and stay there? We need the name. Or the time and the place. We'll monitor their schedule. Then it's over. I can't stand it any more. I wish I could do it instead of you. I'd give anything if I could do it for you. You know that, don't you? You do, don't you? I'd better take this stuff back before he notices it's gone. Gary? Hi. You look funny. - How was your doctor visit? - Fine. Everything's fine. - Where are the kids? - Oh, they're at Mom's. - We gotta go out, so I gotta get ready. - Oh. Where are we goin'? - Get me a beer, will ya? - Yeah. Where are we goin'? Just over here. Relax. - What are we doing here? - Waitin'. He's here. You stay here. I brought somethin' for ya. You've got point, Gar. We're gonna win this war. OK, Bobby. I brought you somethin' else. It's your hit, point. And everything you need is inside. Who was that? The Lone Ranger. The Lone Ranger rides again. Why won't you tell me? Who's crowdin' who now? We go to Denver tomorrow. - Why? - You know why. What's the matter with you? Nothin'. I'm just tired. Good night. I love you, Katie. - Denver. Tomorrow. - Are you sure? Yes. If I disappear now, he'll stop everything. - I have to go through with it. - (STEP CREAKS) All right. You all right, Gary? I gotta check on the fires. You want me to start plantin' now or wait till you're back? Uh, I don't know, Shorty. Wait, I guess. - Come on, Katie. - Bye, Rachel. - Why do you always have to be leaving? - Yeah, but I'll come back. - I'm gonna miss you. - I love you, Rachel. - A whole big bunch? - A whole big bunch. You be a good girl, OK? Gladys. Why don't you put on some rock'n'roll? You don't like rock'n'roll. I know, but you do. (COUNTRY MUSIC ON RADIO) I thought we were going to Denver. Oh... I changed my mind. I wanna get somethin' to eat. Can we stop? Made these myself. Come on, I thought you were hungry. Oh, I am. Look, I really have to go to the bathroom. Go to the bathroom, too? - Well, I guess we gotta stop, don't we? - Yeah. - Katie. Katie, it's me. - (TOILET FLUSHES) - Yeah? - Sorry, uh, that men's room don't work. You don't mind, do you? Good. Excuse me. Oh, stand guard there and keep an eye out. I don't wanna get caught. OK? Some pinhead spelled "hell" with one L. Sickago. Oh, we got some time. You want another sandwich? Relax, Katie. You nervous, Catherine? And your name ain't Phillips, either. It's Weaver. Your mom ain't sick. You don't have any folks. They were killed in a car crash when you were a kid. You're under arrest. Put it down, Gary. Please. What'd you bring me up here for if you knew? I wanted 'em to find a dead FBI agent shooter. Boy, ain't that rich? Put it down, please. You were their whore all along. No. In the beginning I was falling in love with you. You laid down with me to get what they wanted. I didn't think there was anything to get. Put it down. What for? What the hell for? (SIRENS) (APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) - You gonna shoot me? - Don't. Please. Oh, God! I loved you, Katie. Put it down! (TWO GUNSHOTS) There's the gun up there in the glass window! - Call an ambulance! Bring him in! - Oh, my God! They're escaping! (GUNSHOT ECHOES) (GUNSHOT ECHOES) Did Jack Carpenter say anything before he died? - Will you put up another candidate? - Will you announce your candidacy? When a man is gunned down in the street because of what he stands for, you tell me where this country is going. And the saddest part is that that's exactly what Jack was always saying. That we have got to return this country... - He saw me. - ...to the country that we grew up in. They got a second killer. Carpenter didn't have a chance. Neither would you, without your gun. And if I have to run in Jack Carpenter's stead, then that's what I will do. Got here as soon as I could. We are bustin' people all over the country. That printout you gave us was a gold mine. We got money, weapons. Washington is gonna make a statement in an hour. We did it, Cathy. We got 'em. It's the best thing that ever happened to them. - Now they got their own martyr. - We got 'em, Cathy. Don't you get it? - Busting 'em all over the country. - Gary knew who I was. How? - They got someone on the inside. - They couldn't have. They got friends all over. - It doesn't matter. We'll get 'em. - We'll never get 'em. Anyway, we'll never get all of 'em. You can't stop 'em by waiting for 'em to commit a crime each time, Michael. Where are you goin'? - I had to kill him. - Of course you had to kill him. - I didn't have any choice, right? - No. Where are you goin'? You need protection. They know who you are. They'll put you in that computer and they'll all know. Stay with us. We're your family. We protect you. No, I never had a family, Michael. You were my family. The Bureau was my family. I trusted you.
