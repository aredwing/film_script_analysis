"My desires..my moments." "My Songs." "It's your passion." "Qsweethean." "It's your passion." What a beautiful day, isn't it? When you're really happy, from the bottom of your heart. "the world seems beautiful. Life is strange. When you feel even/thing's about to end.. ..and suddenly it shows you couple of ways out. Do you understand what I am saying? Sir, Tara's been arrested. What's your name? Tara Wadia Branson. What's your father's name? Elvis Branson. And your mother's name? Shenaz Wadia Branson. ls there anyone you would like to call? Raghu! A story about lies, truth, loyalty and betrayal. It all began between Tara and me on this night. I killed Fahim Ansari.' But Tara was unaware of the fact that I am a gangster. Hundred percent..it's a bloody gang war. Fahim Ansari, the guy who was ki ed.. ..was our country's biggest drug supplier. Yes! Inspector Rathore. - Sir. Find out..when Fahim Ansari was ki ed.. ..where was Raghu and his men. Yes, sir! On one side, Tara was praying day and night for our ove.. ..and on the other side, I was going to.. ..give her the biggest betrayal of her life. "Take me to my be oved.." ".. ' bless you a million times." "Take me to my be oved.." ".. ' bless you a million times." "Without a glimpse of my be oved.." ".. can't think straight." My eyes will narrate the condition of my hean to him. "Sea of love in my heart." "Sea of love in my heart." "You're the one I want to ove.." ".. want to wait only for you." "You're the one I want to ove.." ".. want to wait only for you." For me.. ife means dying in your love. How long are you going to keep running after wealth? "Sea of love in my heart." "Sea of love in my heart." My conscience couldn't live with. '..cheating on Tara and hiding this incident. You're still awake. Tara.. "there's something I want to say. What? Last night.. met a girl at the bar. And I made a big mistake. Tara, .. - Enough! I don't want to hear anything funher! Why are you two so quiet? Something wrong? Only one month left for your wedding now. So stop fighting like kids.. ..and son out whatever's between you two. Tara. Stop being so stubborn. I know Raghu wants to patch up. Mom, I am going to Ireland soon. I have a show there. What? There's so much still left to do here. You can't go now. Just keep every1hing on hold. What do you mean by "On hold"? What are you saying, Tara? All the invitations have been sent out. Even to Raghu's car dealers and business associates. How can you sudden y.. Mom! Please stop Tara from leaving if you can. Tara. I don't know what's happened between you two. But I think you're making a mistake, sweety. It's not easy to find a man like Raghu. Along with being a successful businessman.. ..he's also a very nice human being. He has hean of gold. Which guy ever treats his mother-in-law like his mother. ..and respects her? And let's her stay at his home, like family? You know people are shocked. ..when I tell them that I'm living with my daughter and son-in-law. He really loves you! Mom. I don't want to discuss this anymore. Hello. No, I can't come. There's some problem between Tara and me. And I don't want her to find out at any cost. ..that the underworld knows me as a gangster. "There was a time." ..when she cared for me more than I did. "She used to say.." ..we' never pan ways ever..after this. Now she asks strangers about my condition. And this pain.. makes my hean cry. "Love..has..betrayed me." "Love..has..betrayed me." "Love..has..betrayed me." "When I look into your eyes." "Baby, I am in paradise." "We can take it to the skies." "We can make it, you and ." "When I look into your eyes." "Baby, I am in paradise." "We can take it to the skies." "We can make it, you and ." Hyder, I don't want to meet anybody, okay? 0K8!- Sir, if you can p ease.. Thank you. I surrender my ove..in the hands of God. Someone p ease.. cajole my beloved. "The memories. pierce my heart." When the loneliness crosses all limits. "There was a time." ..when she cared for me more than I did. "She used to say.." ..we' never pan ways ever..after this. Now she asks strangers about my condition. And this pain.. makes my hean cry. "Love..has..betrayed me." "Love..has..betrayed me." "Love..has..betrayed me." Yes, sir. Tara's staying in some hotel in Dublin. But we've no information about it. She didn't even tell mom. I thoughtmaybe you know. No, sir, I don't have any information either. Raghu you aren't telling me anything neither is Tara. Please tell me. What has happened? After Tara left for Dublin. '..a that was left in my life was her memories. Hello. I knew Tara is innocent. But I had to find out the guy..' '..that framed Tara, and why. I'm sorry, sir. I can't allow you to meet the girl. You must understand the seriousness of this case. She was caught with drugs. And you better get a very good lawyer to prove her innocence. Otherwise..she'll be in a big mess. Hi, sorry I am late. I am Eli Jordan. - Chris. Tara Branson's lawyer. Hi, Eli. I'm Raghu. Thanks for taking up the case. Sure. Eli, they are not letting me see Tara. Please do something so they let me meet Tara. Actually, Raghu..the law here is quite strict. They won't let you meet Tara so easily. But yet.. ' try my best. Mr. L oyd..may I see my client? Yes, Ms. Jordan. - Thank you. Tara Hi! I'm Eli, your lawyer. Raghu appointed me to your case. ls he here? - Yes. But because of legality, you cannot meet him. Tara, in order to get out of this case. ..you must tell me every1hing honestly. So..how did you land up in Dublin. Anirudh Brahmin was my Facebook friend. He invited me here to perform on India Day. But..there's nothing called India Day. Anyway- Then? He said to me that my grandmother will give you some books and CDs. When you come here, bring it along. And I met his grandmother at the address he gave me. And she gave me some books and CDs for Anirudh. Do you know that woman's name? No. Can you tell me something about her appearance? Yes. She was ta ..broad. Fair complexion. She had a heavy voice. Anirudh said he'll meet me at the airport But when I stepped out of the airpon Anirudh wasn't there. I was a little surprised. I waited for him for a long time. But he called me instead. Hi, Anirudh. Hi, I am sorry. I couldn't get to the airport My elder brother met with an accident. He's at the hospital. I am very sorry. I'll get delayed. Give the phone to any taxi-driver. .. ' explain him where you need to go. Then I'll meet up with you there. - Okay. I got in taxi and.. And I was surrounded by Police. Are you sure he was Anirudh Brahmin. I've never spoken to him before this. I only know him through Facebook. And that to since the last 6-8 months. What about his voice? - He had a heavy voice. Tara.. will try my best to prove your innocence, okay. Hi! It was a very long day. Chris was very tough. But we have some imponant information. Anirudh Brahmin, the guy who called Tara to Dublin. ..he terminated his Facebook account before Tara arrived. Chris is trying to recover his photograph from Facebook. And the woman who gave Tara those books and CDs. They are trying to trace that call. And Tara has also given us her description. We can get it sketched. And the call that Tara received from the Airport. ..was from a internet calling system. It could be from anywhere in the world. This means..on y Anirudh Brahmin can save Tara. We have to find out who Anirudh Brahmin is. Anirudh Brahmin. Tara Wadia. Faheem Ansari. The only thing common between all of them is drugs. Faheem Ansari. Killed in a gang-war on 18th July. Related to drug's smuggling. Tara Wadia. She's in Irish Police custody. Related to drugs trafficking. As far as Anirudh Brahmin is concerned. If we want to get to the roots of this network. "then we must find out who he is. We need to find out who is this man. Hey! I killed Anirudh Brahmin's men in self-defence. But by doing so..a trails leading to him had ended. Anirudh Brahmin! I am Anirudh, sir. That photo was mine too. Sir.. never went outside the city.. "then, how can I go to Ireland? Sir, I swear on my kid. I don't know what drugs are..or anything about this drugs case. I don't know, sir. Finding Anirudh Brahmin had become impossible. How can someone find a man that doesn't exist? I was really worried for Tara. Because she was supposed to face trial in court the next day. My lord I request you to grant bail to my client Ms. Tara Wadia. My lord, she can't be granted bail. She was caught red-handed with drugs. Tara Wadia, found guilty. 7 years of rigorous imprisonment. My Lord, she's innocent. Please reconsider my request for Tara Wadia's bail. 7 years of rigorous imprisonment, I say. "Tears filled with your memories." My nights..are filled with sorrows. "My paths are lost."

I'll bring her back. I was just watching videos of Tara and you. Raghu..wi Tara come back? Yes, mom. Tara will come back. I'll bring her back. I promise you. Hello. Abu speaking. Did you get it? Yes. I am sorry, Raghu. Even extradition is not possible in Tara's case. Otherwise I would've at least had her extradited.. ..and she couldn't been in her country's jail. There are other ways in ndia.. ..but the systems here are very strict. It's okay..at least you tried. What will you do now? I'll go back to ndia..with Tara. But how? People escape from prison. Raghu, this is Ireland, not other country. It's impossible. Eli, my mother used to say.. ..a man that turns his obsession into his goa .. ..cannot be stopped until he reaches his destination. You can't shoot? Goddamnit man! Where do you get these guys from? Yeah.. - A God forsaken place. This is bloody Ireland, you know. The Ire have real stuff. And they go Bang-bang-bang! Where do these guys come from? They are a bunch of jokers, you know. That's all they are. I am telling you. Here's one more Indian coming. Would you like to try shooting? Don't be afraid. They're not real, all are blank. Just used glasses and headphones. ..so bullet sound will not disturb you. And then even if you can't hit the target.. ..sti it's all game. So don't feel sad. It's all game. Indians can't shoot proper. They're the best and easiest targets. Ask the neighbouring country. Hey boy, this here is a G-41. Generation four. Practical and tactical .45 ca iber.. ..automatic pistol. Manufactured by G os..in the USA. Do you understand? No? Translation denied. It is real. No automatic, no theory, no catalogue. Just killing the enemy to the centre point. Brand name: Local Pistol. Made by Abu Farooqui. State Azamgarh country, India. And one more thing. It takes an entire country, race, money and the military to catch Osama. Ask the neighbouring country. But to kill one General Dire.. ..a one needs is one Indian Guts and a local pistol. Ask the world! Do you understand? No? No problem! Translation denied. Raghu, this is Rajveer. My almost ex-husband. He's the Indian Ambassador. Rajveer, this is Raghu. I was hoping you can help them out. Anything for you my love. Look Raghu, I'm going to come straight to the point. You know and so do .. Tara's case is an absolute mess. All the evidence are against her. The verdicfs been given. And the sentence has been given. So it's absolutely impossible to do anything now. So what do I do, sir? Go back? No, sir. I won't go back without Tara. At any cost. "Qsweethean." I hate love stories. "It's your passion." "Passion." Tara's face was always in front of my eyes." "My conversationsmy memories." "..the lonely nights." "It's your passion." "Qsweethean." "It's your passion." Eli. I found a way. At that time, getting Tara out of jail was more important for me..' Ethan finding Anirudh Brahmin. Robin Sentino..is one of the biggest con anists in the world. Breaking out of prison is a child's play for him. His father worked for the Britishers at the Karachi pom. And in 1954, while migrating to ndia.. "the Mujahidin's kill him. After that his mother didn't go to India. Although everyone was expecting her to. Instead she went to Spain. And there she met Enrique Sentino. And they got married. He's escaped 14 of the world's most difficult jails in his lifetime. Due to lack of hope in ife.. ..he now stays behind bars willingly. And donates everything that he earns. Dublin jai 's jailor Douglas Broad can take you to Sentino. Sir, my name's Raghu. Doesn't matter if it was Rahim. On the other side of the bars.. ..peop e are lost without their names. And on this side, they're only known by their numbers. I charge. "not per hour.. --" Pei Project. "but per word spoken. So don't ask any stupid questions. And don't ask any more questions you'll have to pay dearly. One more thing. I don't make friends. I don't like relations. I only work for money. Sir, will it be possible? Whether it'll be possible or not is your bloody problem! I ta k..you listen. The desire to stay a ive.. Hope to f y.. "lots of courage..and plenty of luck. You need this deadly combination. ..for the bird to fly out of the coop. No jail in the world is air-tight. And..there's no lock in this world that doesn't have a key. You've to find the right lock and the right key. Driving license will be your key. First of a ..you must memorize Dublin's map. Your destinatiomwhere do you want to reach. ..you must decide that first. And what's more imponant is to decide how you will get there. The city and the entire country's modes of communication.. ..you should know like the back of your hand. They will easily block you. From the time they make an alen call. Sealed off. The police can paralyze the entire city in 20 minutes. They can seal it tight. So quickly. After 9/1 1..a most every country. ..has made security and lockdown plans. What if I can't do it in 20 minutes? Then surrendenotherwise they will shoot you and that girl. Sir, her name is Tara. There will be shoot-at-sight orders issued for both of you. I need two passpons. 2000 Euros..per passport As I told you all in advance. That day I was attacked again. Dublin. A city..that filled my love story with explosives. '..and I could never forget its echo. I had only two motives in life. Getting Tara out of jail. 'And..finding Anirudh Brahmin. His name is Raman Furia. On the 28th, he boarded the same flight from Mumbai as Tara. But he got off in Abu Dhabi on the way. Tara's seat no was 22 B.. ..and his seat no was 22C. Both tickets were booked through the same travel agency. Raman Furia works in a pharmaceutical company. And that day he brought licensed drugs. Rathod. - Sir. I want Raman Furia's passpon details. ..a ong with his address and phone number. Sure, sir. "Intoxication." "Intoxication." "It's clouded my heart." You're the only one that dwells in me. "You've become my God." "Let the world become alienated." "Don't ever let go of me." I cannot bear being separated from you, sweetheart. "Intoxication." "Intoxication." "It's clouded my heart." You're the only one that dwells in me. "You've become my God." "Let the world become alienated." "Don't ever let go of me." I cannot bear being separated from you, sweetheart. You won't meet that girl again. Everywhere I turn to ook.. all I see is your face. Every moment.. think only about you. "Intoxication." "Intoxication." "It's clouded my heart." You're the only one that dwells in me. "You've become my shadow." "Let the world become alienated." "Don't ever let go of me." I cannot bear being separated from you, sweetheart. "Intoxication." Love made me useless. ..otherwise I too had many qualities. I had an unknown bond with Santino. "It's like grains of sand.." "..keep it close to your heart." "Your ove's not a rebe .." "..but don't try his heart." No one's as pure as you..in this world. "Stay away from slanders." "Intoxication." "Intoxication." Happy Annivarsary. You remembered? How can I forget? I love you. Love you too, Raghu. "Intoxication." Why come to me if you wanted to do as you please? I told you not to meet that girl. Yet you went to see her. If you keep meeting that gir .. "the Police will keep a watch on you.. ..and they'll grow suspicious that you're up to something. Then nothing can be done. Nor you, nor that girl. Sir, her name is Tara. What if you hadn't met that girl for 5 more days? Sir, her name is Tara! Whether her name's Tara or Chanda.. ..or Madhuri Dixit.. don't care. I told you before.. I don't care how you do it. Even if you mess it up, it doesn't make a difference to me. Sir, are you sure it doesn't make a difference. It does make a difference to you, sir! And somehow I am really happy.. ..that it makes a difference to you! Sir. We've found Raman Furia. His real name is Montesar Aijaz. And his phone's disconnected. Just tell me..make my job easier. You've made the entire world busy for no reason. Tell me. Are you going to tell me? Sir..its Nafisa Baig. Nafisa Baig. Nafisa madam. Shall we? Sir, can I ask you something? - Yes. How do you speak so uent Hindi? I learnt it in the Indian jails. I've 19 years there. 14 years in UP and 5 years in Tihar. After escaping from there I got arrested here. An old woman came in my way.. ..and I couldn't shoot her. And you? How did you become such a big gangster? When did you kill first time? Sir, I'll charge you for this. We'll adjust. Sir, this happened in 1990. My mother was a junior anist in Hindi films. I loved dramatics. I used to sell tea. A underworld Don called Aurangzeb used to live in our area. I used to go sell tea to him. I could come and go without any security check. And Aurangzeb's enemies knew about it. My mother was really sick. And I needed 10,000 rupees. One day a guy called Anthony came to me and said..' '..ifi kill Aurangzeb..' '..then he can give me 10,000 rupees for my mother's treatement. Anthony trained me to use a gun. He said to me that, if I kill Aurangzeb..' '..then I'll be doing a good thing for the country. '..because he was a demon that was ruining the city of Mumbai.' I said yes. I arrived at Aurangzeb's lair with the intentions of killing him. But then suddenly I changed my mind. I decided that I won't kill him. Hey joker. You look serious today. My mother's very sick. And the doctor's said.. ..the treatment will cost 10,000 rupees. Your mother's so beautiful. Send him to me. She does have a long list of lovers. I am first on the list. He abused my mother. I lost my patience. I killed him. Mom didn't survive. At the age of 9 I was sent to juvenile jail for murder. When I came out.. met Tara.. ..and my life changed, sir. Chief, come in. Chief! Prisoner 312 is bleeding and unconscious. Get the coun orders.. ..and get her to the hospital immediately. The day had finally arrived to elope Tara from jail. If we succeed.. ife would welcome us.. ..and if we miss, we'll be shot dead by the Dublin Police. But right then..there was only one thought on my mind. Every man loved someone sometime. I surrender this life in the name of that love. Now there's just one way that can make things easy for you. Somehow..get Tara shifted to a hospital from that jail. Tara..don't react immediately to whatever I say. "Loneliness. "Loneliness. "Loneliness. "Loneliness. "Lone iness.." All my dreams, my happiness, Without you.. "Lone iness.."Lone iness.. "Lone iness.." After a point..the entire plan should be in your mind. Burn every paper.. ..that can become evidence against you. Security, the phone is not working, p ease..check it. The Wire's have been cut. Sir..we cannot get city hospital. The lines are dead. Hello. - Officer Manin. Chief Josha, here. ls the prisoner there with you? - Yes, chief, we're here. The prisoner is secure, no problem. Just increase the security around her as soon as possible. We'll do it right away, sir. Stay back! Stay back! Stay back! Change. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Stay back! Oh, God! It's a mess there. Quickly send the emergency eet. Send Walter to that Raghu's apartment for any clue. Rest, head to the hospital immediately. According to Sentino, I had only 20 minutes. Because the city's lock down p ans.. ..are initiated 20 minutes later. Hi, my patient Tara is admitted here in the hospital. Tara Wadia? - Yeah, exactly. That's the name. I had to get out of Dublin city in 20 minutes at any cost. "which was almost impossible. Tara! Security! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! They'll keep tell your description to each other. That's why..keep changing your appearance as much as you can. Keep changing your locations. clothes, cars, etcetera. Don't be stupid. Don't move. We've units on all the exits. Tara, press the button. Tara.. Tara, press the button. Don't do this, sir. Don't move. It's most imponant to know about their plans. So you can be one step ahead. They're going to the top floor. Come on. &x They got away. After escaping from jai .. ..unti they don't catch you, or until you're not dead.. "they won't stop chasing you. After escaping from the hospitaL. .. had very little time to get to the station. And if I make any mistake. "then Dublin's lockdown plans will be operative. From here I had to get to my car.. "which I had parked at Golden road. Block stations on either directions. All the main lines. Call the Port authority. Tell them I want that train stopped. Sir, there's something here. Tara's love was the strength. ..that made every difficulty easy for me. One thing that Santino said was true. It's most imponant to know about their plans. And I knew they are waiting for me at the next station. The police were waiting for us at Bourneville station.. "but we got out before. Tell us, madam. Who is posing as Anirudh Brahmin? The real one cried his hean out. What are you so angry about? Speak up! Sir.. don't know any1hing. Some guy called Anirudh Brahmin called me. That's it. Yes, Walter. Sir, they're heading towards pom. Increase all the security checks. ..and check all the entrances in and out of the city. I had only nine minutes to get out of the city. And Dublin police was blocking me. You're going the wrong way. No, Tara. This is the right way. I've misled the police. I knew the police will arrive at our home looking for us. And that's why I intentionally left clues. ..indicating that we're headed for the Port. They will look for us around the Port. ..and we'll head towards the coast. Everywhere they look for us.. "they won't find us. I had only one minute to get out of Dublin city. If don't make it out of Haus Cons in one minute. ..then all the lockdown plans will be initiated. And then escaping would be impossible. Suspect in a black car heading towards the Bay. I want them brought in alive. Yes, sir. What are you doing, Raghu? They got away. Damnit. Mr. Rajveer, I am the Director of Military intelligence, Ireland. I am perfectly aware of who you are, sir. I just hope that you are just as aware of who I am. And I hope there's a really good reason.. ..why I am here on a Sunday morning, unless. ..it's just to exchange a cup of coffee over some pleasantries. How do you know Raghu, Mr rajveer. - I do not? You really don't know who he is? - I just said so, sir. I do not. Do you know Tara Branson Wadia? She escaped this morning with her boyfriend. I guess that's why they say.. Do not ever give a bad girl a good boyfriend. "Qsweethean." "It's your passion." "Passion." We had escaped the city's lockdown p an.. ..and were heading towards the coast. But who is Anirudh Brahmin and why he did this. ..that was still a question "Qsweethean." "It's your passion." Finally we arrived at the Port. ..and fate also gave us a way to find Anirudh Brahmin. Raghu, you'll find Anirduh Brahmin at. He escaped this morning with the help of the bird..Enrique Santino.. ..and some legal support And the suppon of the Indian Embassy. False allegations and invalid accusations" ..are heavier than abuse, Mr. Truman. Are you trying to tell me my duties? Then I suggest that we move on and enjoy the rest of the Sunday. Unless you have something serious to talk to me about. Didn't your wife fight the case of Tara Branson Wadia? My wife once contemplated representing. ..Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussain. She's a lawyer, that's what she does. Where is Douglas Brod? Who, sir? - Douglas Brod? Am I supposed to keep tabs on almost everybody I know? We've found Anirudh Brahmin, Tara. Listen to me carefully. I'll meet you back here in exactly one hour. But if I don't return in an hour.. "then promise me that you'll follow our escape p an.. ..and return to India. And won't wait for me. Please don't go. Try to understand, Tara. I cannot forgive Anirudh Brahmin, Tara. One more thing. I never cheated on you. I never deceived you. It's a pan of my job. - Job? Yeah. I did it for my profession. I am no car-dealer. ..in fact I am a government assassin. What? After coming out of Juvenile jai .. ..Commissioner Afzal Khan took me in his refuge. And I staned working for him. I want you to know what you're getting into. Compared to every job you did for me until now.. "this mission is much more dangerous. The problem is.. 8 of Faheem Ansari's men have been caught. Now..the Human Rights people will step up. Many things will be written against the Indian Government. And these 8 guys will eat Biryani in jail. Then, either on 15th August or 26th January.. ..peop e will stan talking about exchange. And they will all be released. Next the police will risk their lives again to arrest them. And they will be set free again. Just give the orders, sir. What must I do? What do I tell you, Raghu? You're a bright boy. Few police offers, social workers.. ..and a handful of politicians are supponing us. On the 18th of July, Faheem Ansari with four terrorist.. ..wi be in suite no. 1503 of the Imperial Hotel. You'll get only one hour for this operation. One hour! No more! Are we clear? - Yes, sir. Raghu, the mission is crucial. It's imponant for the country. Sir, if I survive until18th Ju y.. "then they won't. Believe me.. I'll bid them off..on y after making them say Hail Mother India. Say "Hail Mother ndia.". Hai ..Mother India. The jobs that police officers can't do officially.. .. do it for them. Only Commissioner Khan and a few Ministers know this. I didn't cheat you. After killing Faheem Ansari.. ..we wanted to kill his elder brother Farooq. And that's why we trapped call-girl Neon. Because Neon was supposed to meet Farooq in Lucknow after two days. Neon was a call-girl at the white club. And she also dealt in drugs. I made the bar-tender deliver this news to Neon that I am a millionaire. Because I knew she would make the first move. And she did exactly that. Next I planted an explosive chip in Neon's mobile. The job's done. And two days later, when she met Farooq in Lucknow. I detonated the chip. Every1hing I did, I did it for my country. I don't do anything wrong. While doing the right things for the country. .. had to do one wrong thing. I deceived you in love. And I am very sorry for that. But today when I don't know whether I'll survive or not. I only want to tell you the truth. I really love you, Tara. But I cannot forgive Anirudh Brahmin.. ..who caused you all this pain. I Will kill him. Promise me..you won't wait for more than an hour. No matter what happens, you'll go back to India. If God's with me.. ' definitely come back. Trust me. I love you, Tara. In order to find Anirudh Brahmin.. .. arrived at the address given to me by Commissioner Khan. What is your enmity with us? Why did you do all this? I am not the one, you're looking for. You'll find him outside Trinity College's old library. After killing you I was going to meet him there. Let me go..p ease. Let me go! Anirudh Brahmin. Hyder was surprised to see me alive. And I was just as surprised to see him as Anirudh Brahmin. Why did you do it? Why? You're asking this Raghu. You killed my father..right before my eyes. And you ask why I did it. I'll tell you. Listen carefully. You're going to enjoy this. After my father's death..my uncle brought me here. Day and night.. lived with just one motive.. "which was to avenge my father's murder from you. Anthony. Anthony was the rascaL. ..who gave you the contract of my father's murder? First kill. Do you know how crazy I am? I even killed that guy that was with him. I came all the way to India from Ireland only for you, Raghu. But then I thought. I thought. Death will be a really small punishment for you. Your life dwe s..in Tara. Right? Tara. I joined her group. And befriended her on Facebook..using a fake ID. Chit-chat-chit-chat. Interesting, right? And then I waited..for the right time" ..the right opportunity. And you gave me that. Your breakup with Tara. I took advantage of that opportunity and called her here. Ireland! My home country! And I made my man.. ..ca her through internet calling. And in the ight. Montsar Aijaz. Aka Raman Furia. They were my men.. Who changed the books that Nafisa Baig gave.. ..with the books that contained drugs. He was a pharmacist. He has license to carry drugs. Nafisa, Montesan. ..it was important to change the books in the flight, Raghu. So that you never find any link to get to me. I was completely sure.. ..that she'll be caught at the customs. But she got out of there. She got out. But then.. called Ireland's Narcotirfs depanment. I wanted to show you, Raghu.. "the pain of a kin makes you restless too. And when I thought you will manage to save her.. .. was forced to attack you at Dublin Castle. I wanted you to die with the remorse. ..that you couldn't do anything for her. You know, Raghu.. ..you can never get her out of this mess. You can't. You know, Raghu..what I am doing right now? Tara is in my arms. M! "pa. ..are on her lips. Do you know, Raghu.. ..where my hands are? Do you know? Hyder! - Shoot! Kill me! No! You cannot kill me. You know..if I die.. ..then there's no evidence of Tara's innocence. You know, Raghu..my mother used to say. I am a lunatic. I can do any1hing. But I am not crazy enough to understand. ..that you can't kill me. You can't kill me, Raghu. You call yourself a lunatic, don't you? Let's play crazy. One bullet in..five chambes empty. PoinLand shoot. One who wins lives one who loses is dead. I saw this in a Anil Kapoor film when I was a kid. Since then I just love this dialogue. Come on, let's try our fate. Scared! You're a lunatic, aren't you? What happened? Laugh! Laugh! Are you done yet? Your father was a ow ife.. ..scoundre and a basm He died like a scum. Your death. ..wi be worse. You shouldn't have done this to Tara. What you did was wrong. To hell with Tara's innocence! And to hell with you! Game over! It was really nice of you to help him. Raghu's a really nice guy. Well Afzal and I go back a long way. Consider that he's our country's boy. As you command. You haven't forgotten that line yet. And isten..ta k to Eli and.. Yeah, It'll be done. Don't worry. And Douglas Broad? ls he a friend too? You should always make an offer they can't refuse. I guess a 's well that ends well. I am glad they are together again. But how will they get to India? Afza 's men and my men are very good at that. We've done it before, we'll do it again. Will you marry me again.. ..before the divorce? You serious? "Everyme I looked at the sky." All I ever thought was that you're my God. " felt the same in my desires.." ..every word you said, made my hean cry. Every time I bowed taking your name.. .. found my reflection in your tears. "The head's very one y." "Why should I stay alone?" " 've a request for you." My life's incomplete, you make it complete. My life's incomplete, you make it complete. What a love story? Death is cenain. Your memories are etched in my mind. I can't shed tears. or spon a smile. Why did you leave and where did you go, I don't know any1hing. Someone just tell me what was my mistake. "Your memories are..everywhere." "Your memories are..everywhere." Our meeting isn't..without a reason. You're my ove..but you're not here. "There's definitely a reason." You're my ove..but you're not here. "There's definitely a reason." "Your memories are..everywhere." What was destined to happen has happened? What was supposed to be lost, is lost. I had to fall in love with you and go crazy and I did. "Now this madness controls me.." "What do I do?" It's a small questiomwhether I live or die. Lock stations in either directions. All the main lines. Call the port authority. Tell them I want that train stopped. How can I make this journey..alone? "You dwe ..inside me.." And narrating this fee ing..isn't possible. "O beloved." You're my ove..but you're not here. "There's definitely a reason." "Your memories are..everywhere." Your memories are etched in my mind. I can't shed tears..or spon a smile. Why did you leave and where did you go, I don't know any1hing. Someone just tell me what was my mistake. I am breaking apart piece by piece. "Gradually drowning in your ove." My days are lost and nights are wandering. "This yearning." "..is infinite." You're my ove..but you're not here. "There's definitely a reason." "Your memories are..everywhere." "Your memories are..everywhere."
