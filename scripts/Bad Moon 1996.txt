We can have the film pouched out to Delhi... ...then send it on to Calcutta. Old Jonesy should be happy. We're only two weeks late. This has been such a wonderful adventure. You made it wonderful. Mark it down in your book. September, the Amazon. July, Egypt. Okay? But in the next five minutes, bed. No! Ready, boy? Come on. Come get it! Come on. You want the ball, Thor? You want the ball? Yeah, come on. You ready? Go get it! Go get it! Bring it back. Come here, Thor! Come here, give me the ball. Come here! Come back here! Give me the ball. Thor, come here! I'm going to get you, boy! Where you going? Where's the ball? Nice doggy. Nice doggy. You're a big one. Are you a dog or a horse? It's not a horse. It's a German Shepherd. He's a hell of a big German Shepherd, ain't he? May I help you? - You must be the lady of the house? - Yes, I am. I see you got a young boy. You help him get the best education possible? I represent the Pacific Northwest Magna Reading Project. We have books which studies have proved... ...are a major benefit towards learning phonetics and vocabulary. If I could have five minutes of your time to show them to you... ...you won't be disappointed. We're not interested in buying anything right now. No, please. Please. Let me show you these books my company has developed. I have them right... ...here. Whoa, lady! You ever heard of a leash law? Want to control that dog before it bites somebody? Thor! Get off him! Get him off me! Go to the house! Go on! - Are you okay? - No, he bit me! Jesus! Where did he bite you? You've got a dangerous animal there, lady. I'm suing. You better get hold of a lawyer right away, because you'll hear from mine! You can talk to me. I'm a lawyer. Sit and stay down! Did he bite you? If he did, you really need to see a doctor. Since you're on foot, I'll drive you to the emergency room. Why don't I take you to my own doctor? I got my own doctor. All right. I've heard enough, Flopsy. Who's Flopsy? A flopsy, Brett, is a con man who does things like... ...pretending to get hit by cars... ...or intentionally provoking dogs pretending to get bitten. He threatens to sue people or have their pets destroyed... ...if they don't pay him money. I've prosecuted plenty of these guys. Then I'll see you in court. Call Sheriff Bragg. Tell him you're my son. He'll take the call. Tell him we got a problem and to send a deputy right away. Well, Flopsy, it's been really nice knowing you. I guess I'll visit you in the slammer. Stay! My advice is to turn around and walk away without saying a word... ...and without looking back. You ain't heard the last of this. I think I have. Don't think of it as a total loss. You learned a valuable lesson. Do not mess with a lawyer on her own turf. Good night, Thor. Lousy night shift. Overtime. 23.7. Hello? Ted! Hi, how are you? Where are you? You've been back that long and you haven't called me? Creep! Of course, we'd love to see you! We'll be up to the lake in a few hours. I thought Uncle Ted was in another country. So did I. He's been back three months and he didn't even call me. That flaky brother of mine! Hey, sis. How are you? How are you? Ever think of using a razor? Maybe to slit my throat. It's good to see you, Janet. That's why you've been back two months and don't tell me where you are. You putz! It's good to see you, too. You shot up like a weed. Uncle Ted, can I shoot the rifle? Maybe we better talk about that later. Come on, let's go in and visit. How's it going at the new firm, Janeway and Samuels? So far, so good. My caseload's lighter than it was in the Chicago DA's office. Pace is a lot easier. And, frankly, I am so glad to be out of criminal litigation. How are you adjusting to small-town life? For me, like that! For Brett, it's not so easy. He hasn't made any friends in the neighborhood. But Chicago's no place to raise kids. Out here, it's safe. You know, sis, I'm proud of you. I have to take my hat off to you. You're a full-time mom to Brett and still work full-time at the firm. It's just great. You're not telling me something. Things haven't been going good since I got back from the jungle. Marjorie's gone. I'm sorry. So now it's just me and... ...my shadow. What? Don't do that to me! Good dog, Thor. Shoot! - I haven't seen him. - I wouldn't worry about him. Hey, sweetie. Come say hello to your Uncle Ted. That's Thor. Overprotective. Maybe if he saw you more... Come. Come. We're two of a kind, aren't we, old pal? What did you do, spit in his Alpo? He knows an old dog when he sees one. You better get moving if you want to get him home by bedtime. You have a long ride ahead. I want you to stay with us for a while. I didn't realize how late it was. I'm worried about you. Don't worry. - Just say yes. - Yes. Good. You're coming with us. No, but I'll come by soon. When? I'll call you. This week. This week. Good. Come on. Come on, Thor! Hello? Sis? How are you doing? Yeah, you know... ...having you up here was really great. It really lifted my spirits. Frankly, sis... ...you know... ...it's everything. It's everything. I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciated... ... your trip up here and... ...family... It's all we've got. Is there a problem up there? Problem? Up here? No problem at all. Just... ...having you here, like I said... ...lifted my spirits. I reckon you're right. So if it's not an imposition... ...maybe I can visit you. Ted, you know you are always welcome up here. Here's what you'll do: Park your Airstream in the backyard and live out of my fridge. Here's to family. And having you next door to me, like when we were kids. It's nice to be out of the woods, all the memories. I'm always right. Yeah, it's really annoying. Always has been. Honestly, I'm glad you're here. Me, too. Get out of there! Handcuffs? It's not what you think. What are these? "Maximum Security High-Tempered Steel." - It's not what you think. - Ooh, baby! I think I better keep my eye on you. It'll be interesting having you around. Come on. I'll make dinner. No, thanks, I'm going to go for a run. I'm gonna keep a low profile tonight. If that's all right with you? Come and go as you please, as long as you follow my rules. Come on, Thor! Good night, Thor. What the hell? What's going on? Thor! What's wrong? What? Come on. You want to go outside? Okay, out, out! Thor, come on. Good boy. Come on. Let's go! Come on! Come on! What's with you? What? What? Let's go home. Okay? You're such a baby. Come on, let's go. Come on! What? What's the deal with you? We've got to go home. Jesus, ever heard of sleep? You crazy dog! Come on. You were at his funeral. You had quite a long relationship with your boyfriend. We were together for three years. Three years. Come on! Let's go! You love baseball. Where are you going? Thor! Don't do that! Come here, Thor. Get over here, you knucklehead. That wasn't very nice. We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin. Hunters and police are patrolling a 50- mile square area in Timberline... ... as the curfew enters its third day. Police revealed today the discovery of a fifth dead hiker... ... in the woods near Timberline. The five men and women were mutilated by what authorities think is an animal... ... possibly a grizzly bear. Hunters and bloodhounds are patrolling a 50- mile square area... ... and a curfew is now in effect on Timberline. This is Sarah Williams reporting for KBDL. Hi, Thor. Come on, Thor. Let's go. Good morning. Good morning, sis. Why didn't you tell me about the curfew up in Timberline? The hikers who were killed? That crazy animal that's loose up there? I just saw it on TV. There were police everywhere. Oh, that. I was going to tell you about it this morning. I guess this means you'll have to stay until they lift the curfew. I guess. You want some breakfast? Yeah, great. In good time, old boy. In good time. It's not funny. He's turning into the Wolfman. I'm sorry, it's the full moon part. In movies, the guy only turns into a werewolf during a full moon. That's the way it works. When there's a full moon, he turns into a werewolf. Everyone knows that. Why only the full moon? Why not any moon? Because that's the way a werewolf works. You have to shoot him with a silver bullet. I bet if you blew his head off with a shotgun it would do nicely. Don't you know anything about werewolves? I know you turn into one if you get bit by one. But the full moon part... It's been my experience that any moon will do the trick. Werewolf-wise. Have you ever met a werewolf? I've been acquainted with a few. And you? Come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as werewolves. Well... There you go. Will you take the trash out before breakfast, please? Aw, Mom. Don't "Aw, Mom," me. Go. So, what happened last night? I don't know really. Thor thought he heard something in the woods, woke up the whole house. Lucky you were in the Airstream. Anyway, I finally let him out. He ran into the woods and he didn't come back. I called him with that dog whistle but he kept barking. So? What did he find? Nothing. What do you think it was all about? I don't know. I'm not worried. He barks at practically anything. I don't know, Janet. Big predators can travel long distances if their habitat runs dry. Though there hasn't been anything dangerous here recently... ...doesn't mean it'll always be safe. If I were you, I wouldn't let Brett play out there until... Until what? There weren't supposed to be wolves up where I am. Look what happened to those people. They said it was a grizzly bear. Wolves, grizzly bears, same difference! You have to be a little more cautious. Take the dog more seriously and don't let him play out there. Don't you think you're overdoing it? Thor isn't helpless. How big is that dog? Get this, he's 105 pounds. Do you know how big a gray wolf gets? Try 200 pounds! Give me a break, Ted. The dog barks at night... ...and suddenly you've got a 200-pound wolf at the door! Are you feeling okay? Piss off. Take your dog in the house, please! I'd like to go for a run. Come on. Come on, it's bedtime! Come on. Come on! Thor, come on! It's bedtime! Come on in. Come on, come on. Good boy! Come here. What's up with you? You be a good dog. You be a good dog. Be a good dog. Yeah, I love you, too. Good night. What's wrong, boy? You want to go out? Hey, buddy. Come here. Come on. What happened to you? Who cut you? Oh, baby, who did this to you? Come on, let's go clean you up. Come on, it's okay. It's all right. Come on, sweetie. It's okay, come on. This is Janet Harrison, 43 Oak Creek Lane. Hi, Sheriff. Are you in there? You in here? Nice, Ted. December 28, 1995. Stateside. Saw a doctor here. Had blood test. Doctor couldn't identify strain. Some infection that isn't in the books. Had another blackout last night. Woke up in the woods. December 29, 1995. Blacked out again. Woke in the woods. Blood on me. Not mine. May 18, 1996. I have tried all medical solutions to no effect. There is no known cure in medicine... ... but maybe... ... just maybe, there's hope for me. Janet and Brett came up to the lake today. To see her again did my heart good. She has invited me to stay with her. Perhaps if I spend time with her, with my family... ... this disease will go into remission. Medicine will not stave off this disease. Perhaps love... ... its restorative power... ... family love... ... will save me. It's my last chance. Nobody... ...makes a fucking fool out of me. Here, doggie. Here, poochie, poochie. Come here, you frigging stupid dog. Nice doggie. Where have you been? Is this the man who approached your place last month? Yes, it is. He's dead. His name is Jerry Mills. We found him a couple hundred yards from your house. He bore the marks of an animal attack. He's been torn open by a big animal like a wolf or... Or a dog, is that it? Yes, ma'am. I do recall you told me the last time Thor almost took a bite out of him. Maybe last night when Mills came back, Thor attacked him again. Thor got in a fight last night... ...with something or... ...someone. He's got cuts all over him. I see. You know about these slayings up in the Timberline area... ...those hikers that were killed? Yes, Janet. That wouldn't be the same animal. It would've had to travel 200 miles from Timberline to get here. That's not what I mean. My question is... ...is it possible that... ...they were committed by a human being? No chance at all, Janet. They were done by a big animal. No man could tear a person apart the way that beast butchered those people. The same with Mills last night. Wolves are the probable culprits. Very big wolves, but not a man. Not humanly possible. Why did you ask? I don't know. I reckon that's all for now, Janet. I'll be in touch. Thanks. One thing. I know you love Thor. If he tore up Mills, he was doing so to protect you. Once a dog becomes a biter, gets a taste for blood, he becomes dangerous. I suggest you consider shopping for another hound. Good morning, big guy. How are you doing this morning? Want to go outside, Thor? Want to go outside? Right to the Airstream. Where were you last night, Ted? I went for a run. All night? You didn't see anything? Hear anything? Get him off me! No! Don't! Get in the trailer! Get him off! Thor, get off! Get in the house! I can't hold him back! Come on! Come on! Thor, come on! Bad dog! Bad dog! Stop it! Come on! Calm down! Get in there! Come on. Come on, sweetie. Come on. It's okay. I'm sorry. Come on. Come on. I'm sorry, babe. Hold his head. It's okay, Thor. Go on. Okay. Good boy. I got him. Thor! Come back! Brett, come here. They have to take him. There's nothing we can do about it. Don't go! They'll kill him! They have to take him, Brett. He's dangerous! No, it's not true, Mom! It's not true! Let go! Mom, they're going to kill him! He's going to die! Let go! I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Come on! Come on! It's okay. It's probably genetic. It happens with Shepherds. It's the way they breed them. Thor's pedigreed. It doesn't happen to pedigrees. You'll have to see a doctor for that. No, I won't. It's just a flesh wound. No veins or tendons were cut. Nothing I can't take care of. You'll need a tetanus shot. I can give myself a tetanus shot. Excuse me a second. I'm sorry about your dog, son. Come here. Come here! There'll be other animals in your life. It's time for bed. I'll be right up. I guess I'll turn in, too. If I ask you a question... ...will you tell me the truth? Of course. Where's Marjorie? Seattle. Come on! Shit! Company? Just what I came here to get away from. Sis? Janet? Is it you? Yeah, Ted. What the hell's going on? Playing Nancy Drew, are we, sis? You caught me at a rather awkward moment. I was just about to... ...restrain myself. But now that you're here, that might be somewhat pointless. You're going to come clean with me right now! Family love, Janet. I thought it could save me... ...but I was wrong. But, hey, we all make mistakes! You sent the dog to the pound, Janet. I warned you. I told you I shouldn't be here, but you wouldn't let me go. You wanted to play big sister. You had to be right. You always have to be right, but this time you're wrong! You should have listened to the dog, Janet. He was trying to protect you. Handcuffs. I was going to use these on myself. Can you believe that? What's happening? They were supposed to keep people from finding out about my... ...private affair. My mistress. Oh, my God. But, you... You already know, don't you, sis? Yes, you know... ...the handcuffs won't keep my little secret a secret any longer. Come back here! You stupid bitch! I'll get you out! Come on! Come on! All right, Thor, come on! Quick! You're free! Let's go! We've got to go! Get the fuck off my son! Do it. Finish it. Hey, there, big guy. You saved us. You're our hero, Thor. Good dog. Mom, is everything okay? Yeah, everything's okay. Everything's okay. Gee, Thor, hello. Come here.
