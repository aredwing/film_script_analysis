Well, occasionally, we need special supplies. But we spend most of our time working on studies. We like to keep to ourselves. Well, I'm sure you can understand that that kind of behavior... ... can make some people uncomfortable. So how do you respond to those who call the Quanta Group a cult? Well, this is why I'm here. To convey that we're not. Our belief system is based on empirical evidence. Cults are based on blind faith. Sometimes on science-fiction authors ' beliefs. I see. Well, let me ask you. How long has Dr. Talbot been leading your organization? You would define it as 10 years. Really? Well, how would you define it? Well, the Teacher has shown us that time is nonlinear. It could be 10 years or 10 minutes. It all becomes irrelevant within the context of a multiverse. Well, unfortunately, my time is all too linear here. So we're gonna have to be wrapping it up with IO from the Quanta Group. I love the name, by the way. I'm Lina Vance. Thank you so much for joining me on Community at Large. Please join me next time when my guest will be Leo Zimmerman... ... a local business owner and family man... ... who spends his spare time as a bullfighter. Can 't wait to see what his wife has to say about that. Okay. Take care, everyone. And please join us next time on Community at Large. Time to get up, sleepy. Already? I wish I could go with you, baby. Don't worry. I'll stop by the station afterwards. You'll be the first to know. I love you. I love you. Promise me you're not gonna call your mother before you call me first. I promise. Yeah. Hey, Deb. If I'm on a call, will you hit me on my cell, okay? I'll wait for you to get back. I wanna see your face. Hey, what do you got there? What is that? - Oh, what's this? - Yeah. This would be homemade lasagna. This is a little caesar salad my wife made for me. - Oh, is that caesar? - Yeah. - Oh, that's... - No trades. - No trades, man. - I just wanted to... Why you eyeballing my food? You always try to take my food. - Why you gotta be like that? I just wan... - See this? Deb made these. Sugar cookies. You can't have any. Nice. You're a nice guy. Come on, Monroe. Learn to catch, you moron. - Hey, Ray, what's the score? - Fourteen-three. Fourteen-three? Those are my numbers. - I get 20 bucks at the quarter. - Traitor. What was that? - You're not gambling out here, are you? - Gambling? - Gambling? - Cap. In the station? Captain, what kind of guys you think we are? Cute, Hernandez. Very cute. - Dave, your wife's out front. - My wife? Yeah. What are you doing, Vic? Well, I'm just... I put the lids on. Flies might... - Flies? - Mine... I've got mine right here. - Eat your own lunch, man. - I'm... - Hey. - Hi, baby. So? It's a boy. Yes! It's a boy. It's a boy. You hear that? Oh, my God. A girl wouldn't be bad, baby, but I just... You know, it's just... - I know, I know. - Oh, my God. - Oh, you're so excited. - Yeah. That's great. - Didn't think I had it in me. - Sign him up. - Hey. - Hey, congrats. - Thank you so much. - That's awesome. Hey, I got an idea. Why don't you name him after me? Little Vic. It's got a nice ring to it, doesn't it? Let me think about it. No, I think that one Vic in my life is enough. - I kind of I like it. I do. - See? - You like it? - I do. Deb knows what she's talking about. Listen to her. - Thank you, Victor. - Is that my cookie? - Okay, bye. - See you later. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Go save the world. Okay. I love you. - I love you too. Excited? - Congratulations. - Yeah. - I'm excited. - Bye, baby. - Bye. Yes. Don't have much on this one, fellas. Woman, 30s, fainted out on Lake Road. Near the reservoir. That's not our district, Cap. The boys at 27 are at a structure fire. We're next in line. Be careful out there. - All right. - You got it. Clear. Bye-bye, Little Vic. Oh, yeah. This is Rescue 4-3-7. Go. Four-three-seven, what's your ETA on the accident? We got a three-minute ETA. Just turned off the main highway onto Lake Road. Copy, 4-3-7. I gotta say, man. I admire you. What do you mean? You and Deb. You guys have been trying so long to have a baby. I mean... A lot of people couldn't have went through what you two been through. - Yeah. It was hard for Deb. - For both of you. Man, I could never do that. Even if I had a woman like Deb, I couldn't do it. You might surprise yourself, you know? Find the right woman. Settle down. I doubt it. Besides, the man upstairs has bigger plans for me. And it's not to bring kids into this messed-up world. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... You and Deb are gonna make... You know. It's all good. It's all a matter of perspective anyway. Well... My perspective after working this job for so long is that people are basically crazy. All the more reason to bring some normal babies into this world, no? Otherwise, the crazies... ...are gonna take over. See, that's the problem. Everybody starts off normal. It's what happens afterwards that messes them up. And we're normal? Hey, I think this is it. Dispatch, this is Rescue 4-3-7. Be advised we're on-scene. Copy that, 4-3-7. - My mom is sick. - Okay. She said she couldn't breathe. Ma'am? Can you hear me, ma'am? Okay. Come over here with me, sweetie. - Tell me your name. - Libby. - Can you tell me your mother's name? - Rebecca. - And how are you? Are you okay? - Yeah. Okay. Don't worry, it's gonna be okay. We're gonna be fine. Dave, over here. We need the AED on her. She's unresponsive. Hurry, they're coming. What do we got? She's pulseless. Breathing is shallow. She's burning up. Dry as a bone, though. Hang on a second. I've never seen tattoos like them before. What is that, algebra? I don't know. She's PEA. Must be a druggie. People should have a license to have kids. Yeah. Let's get her on the rig. - Oh, shit. - She's coding. Let's get that bag on her. They're here. - What's up with these guys? - Hey. - Hey. - Leave her alone. - Back away. - Hey, relax, man. We're paramedics. She has cardiac arrest. - We're trying to save her. - I said, step away. - Put the guns down. Are you crazy? - Look. You're making a big mistake. - We're trying to save this girl. - No. Put your guns down, man. What are you doing? - Hey. Hey! - No! No! Did you hear? She's in cardiac arrest. If we don't get her to a hospital, she'll die. - And I told you to back up off of her. - Get Rebecca and get her in the truck. You're killing this woman right now if you take her away. - Get away now! - Hey, hey, hold up. No. Hold up, man. You're gonna kill her! Get off... What's wrong with you people? You put her in that truck, she dies. Hey. Hold it. Hold up. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to take you guys with me. - Hell, no. - You're kidding, right? Listen. We got a call. We came out here, just doing our job. We're paramedics. We're out of here. There's no way we're going with you. Yo, Vic, call this in, man. Yeah, it's bullshit. I'm gonna call somebody right here. You motherfuck! He fucking shot me, Dave. You shot my partner. What the fuck? Leaving you here is not an option for me. Okay, fine. We'll go with you, okay? - Just put down the guns, please. - Fuck. Fuck. Stay down. They didn't even give her a chance, man. Let me see your shoulder. It's clean, in and out. No talking. Out of the truck. Come on. Let's go. - What the fuck? - Keep moving. Be careful. Okay, man. Watch your step. Slowly. Can't you see he needs help, man? Motherfuck! We'll tend to him once you've been decontaminated. What do you fucking mean, decontaminated? We're freezing, G. Okay, okay. I'm clean, I'm clean. You motherfucker! Hey, hey. Easy, easy. I got it. I got it. - How are you feeling? - Like shit. I can 't move my arm. Hey. - Dressing looks good. - Sit back down. What is this place, Dave? Who are these people? I have no fucking idea, man. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Can I get you something to drink? No, we're good. How about letting us the fuck out of here? I understand you are feeling upset right now. Hey, we were trying to save that woman's life. Her death is your fault. You know that, right? I'm truly sorry for your current situation. But our actions were necessary to preserve the integrity of our mission. Mission, huh? What mission? In less than 13 hours... ...we will be leaving this place. What is this place? Is this a kind of government experiment or something? Who the fuck are you people? We're the Quanta Group. The what? We are a small organization. A dedicated few with a common goal. "A common goal." And what goal is that? To perpetuate our species. You could've fooled me. Listen to me. You can't just kidnap two paramedics on a call... ...without somebody knowing, okay? If we don't show up or check in... ...someone's gonna come looking for us. You understand that? By the time they have determined what has happened, we will have gone. Gone where? Take them to the Reflecting Room. I'll need to discuss our options with the Teacher. - What the fuck is the Reflecting Room? - Let's go. - You think about what you're doing. - Come on. Let's go. You hear me? You think about what you're doing. I'm sorry for this, sir. We had no choice. Come on. Let's go. I said, let's go. - Hey. - Come on... Easy. You guys are making a huge mistake. You know that? Know what the maximum for kidnapping is? Yeah, it's like 20 years. You really want that? You are the one who will be serving the sentence. Not us. These people are freaks, man. What's up with those tattoos? You see them? They're like devil's pitchforks or something. I have no idea. How's your arm? It hurts. Hurts like hell. - Dave? - Yeah? You think they're gonna kill us? No. If they were gonna kill us, they would've already done it. I knew something bad was gonna happen. I knew it. You remember that tremor we had last night? My mother's picture fell off the wall... ...and broke glass all over the floor. It was the only thing that fell off. It was the only thing that was damaged, Dave. Listen, Vic. Please don't... Don't start with that superstitious mumbo-jumbo shit, all right, buddy? We'll figure a way out of here. How are we gonna do that? Like I said. We don't check in... ...they'll come looking for us. The appearance of an objective world... ...distinguishable from the subjective self... ...is but the imaginary form... ...in which consciousness... ...perfectly realizes itself. An independent reality. In the physical sense. It cannot be ascribed to the phenomena... ...nor to the agencies... ...of observation. - Stop it. You're hurting her. - No. No, Libby, no. - You cannot touch the Teacher. - He's hurting my mom. You're gonna kill her. Take her to the Reflection Room. It will do her some good. - You're gonna kill her. - She shouldn't be here. - Kill her. No, stop! Stop! No. No, don't. I want my mom! Libby, what you did endangered all of us. So you need to reflect... ...and find your equilibrium before it's too late. Why are you locking her up, huh? She's only a little kid. What could she have possibly done? God's gonna punish you, you stupid bastards! Libby. Libby, can you hear me? Remember? We came to help your mom at the gas station. No talking. Listen, I need you to talk to me, Libby. Please. Please be quiet. They'll hear you. Look, Libby, I know you're scared. But I really need you to tell me what's going on here. I'm not allowed. These people are freaks, man. They're freaking cuckoo. They're some kind of devil worshipers. That's what's going on here, Dave. Vic, look. You need to relax, all right? Libby, can you tell me where they took your mother? Can you tell me what the mission is? The Teacher says we were chosen. Chosen? What does that mean? When the sun comes up in the morning... ...the Teacher's going to take us to the new world. He says we can live there forever. And where is this place? On the other side of the universe. You hear that shit, man? This is some kind of freaking Hale-Bopp or Bob... ...or some kind of Heaven's Gate kind of suicide cult, man. - Freaks. - Vic, please. Libby. Libby, did the Teacher tell you how he was gonna take you there? We all have to go to sleep first. Oh, Jesus. They probably wanna do the same shit to us, man. - That's why they haven't killed us yet. - Vic, Vic. Please, please. Look. We don't know that for sure, all right, bro? What time did they report? Three-forty-four, sir. We're showing them as still on-scene. Still on-scene? Yes, sir. - Okay. - I'll verify with central dispatch. Give me a buzz the second they report in, okay? Will do. - All right, thanks. - Sure. - Are they inbound yet, Cap? - No. Damn. They better get back before my shift's over. Vic owes me 20 bucks on the game. It's working on three hours since they left the station. How much you want to make a bet they're celebrating Dave's good news? Dispatch says they're still on-scene. "A sign of evolution to complete the system. A, B, C. 1-5-4." What the fuck do these numbers mean? - Undeniable truth. - Hey, Vic? - Yeah? - You hear that? Yeah. What is it? Voices coming from somewhere. Where are they coming from? - The Teacher will show us... - Hey, wait. There's a vent in here. - What are you doing? - I'm gonna check it out. Be careful. We'll be surrounded by love. Be careful. Oh, yeah. Just be calm and don't worry about anything. The Teacher's gonna take care of us... ...and then we will rise up to the heavens. Undeniable truth. - You see anything? - I see... It's like... There's a bunch of kids and a woman. It's like they're... Like class or something. I feel sorry for those kids, man. - Have a wonderful time. Just be sure, children, everything you do... The Teacher will show us... How are you holding up? Not good. I'm bleeding again, bad. I need a new bandage. We gotta get you to a hospital. Oh, shit. Shit. You see that? - Yeah. - That's not possible, man. That's impossible. Maybe she wasn't as bad as we thought. No. Are you kidding? She was... She coded. She had no pulse. She was rolling around the back of the truck blue. No talking, please. Mommy? Hello, sweetheart. I wanted to see you. What happened to you? I fell into a deep sleep. But the Teacher woke me up. We shouldn't have run away. It was selfish of me. Dave. Dave this... This can't be happening, man. She's... She should be dead right now. Vic, I'm trying to listen, man. We must prepare ourselves for the transition, Libby. The Teacher has entrusted us to carry out the mission. The rest of the world depends on us. I endangered our future. I hope you can forgive me. I have to go now. I just wanted to let you know I was here for you. Can I come with you, Mommy? I'll come back for you very soon. No, Mommy. Please. I wanna go with you now. Mommy, please. Just don't leave me. Who are you people? Why are you keeping us here? You're a good man, Victor. Just a lost soul. We can show you a life everlasting. But you must first forget all that you believe to be true. How do you know my name? Who the fuck are you people? - Dave. - Yeah? How the fuck do they know my name? The nametag. - She must've seen it at the gas station. - She was unconscious, man. They took our uniforms though. They could've got it off the uniforms. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. - They took our stuff. - Right. - They saw our nametags, right? - Sure. Yeah, exactly. Don't let them get to you, man. They're trying to fuck with your mind. Right? You saw her, right? You saw her. She was dead. She was in the back of the truck. She was blue. She had no pulse. She was dead. She might've had a seizure. You know that can happen. There's something crazy going on with these people, man. The Teacher has informed me he'll set up a briefing with the two paramedics. I don't feel comfortable revealing our mission to strangers. - They shouldn't even be here. - Yes, but they are, Mara. And the Teacher feels that it must be by design. We should give them a chance to save themselves. Why don't we just leave them behind? We have so much to do. We can't. The Teacher feels that it's not worth the risk. We should give them a chance. If there's no risk in a collapse in the quantum state... ...then I see no harm in taking them with us. Hopefully, they will see the truth. And if they don't? We can't leave them behind. 148 North Saint Andrews. Ninety-one, clear. Thirteen-eighty, 61. Thirteen-eighty, 61. Switch to tach, 2 for 13-Victor-6. Phoenix 25- 14 can transmit on tach 2 with your message. Seven sending 6, roger. Afternoon, officer. Fill her up? Thank you. Thank you very much, folks. Thank you. Well, we have a wild show today. This is Dave. Leave me a message. Okay, now I'm worried. The captain just called here and asked if you were here. Can you call me back when you get the message? If I find out that you and Vic went to some bar to celebrate... ...you're gonna be in huge trouble. Call me back. "Mathematics is the language... ...in which the gods speak to people. All things are a number." Man, there's some crazy shit in here, Dave. Yeah, bro. I have the same shit in here. What do you think it means? Looks like someone was trying to figure something out. Maybe they're trying to say something. Whatever it is... ...it's some fucked-up religion if you ask me. It ain't like no religion I've ever seen. I heard the other day that some guy... ...threw his two kids off a 14th-story balcony... ...while on vacation with his family. After that, he jumped himself. Come to find out that he and his wife were having marital problems. It's one thing to kill yourself, but to throw your kids... ...off a balcony just to get back at your wife? Well, I can't figure that out. Why would God let something like that happen? I think you're the one that told me that God works in mysterious ways, right? Yeah, you got that right. Gentlemen, are you awake? - What do you think? - Yeah. The Teacher wants to speak with you in the White Room. What's the White Room? It's where we go to learn the truth. Where are you going, man? I think they're gonna let us go. How you doing? Get my partner to a hospital. He's losing a lot of blood. We'll tend to his injury after your briefing. All I need to do is get my gear. I'm a fucking paramedic, for chrissake. I said, we will attend to it, Mr. Vaughn. But first, the Teacher wants to see you. It's very important and we don't have much time. I assure you it will be an enlightening experience. I'm sure it will. Jesus Christ. How many of these people are there? Too many. Sit here, please. The Teacher will speak with you in just a moment. What's that symbol? It represents our individual positions in the universe on a subatomic scale. It has great spiritual significance for us. Welcome to the Quanta Group, gentlemen. They call me the Teacher here. Forgive me for not meeting with you in person. But I am afflicted with numerous allergies. And so I must minimize my contact with others. I hope you will understand. Are you fucking kidding me? Look, I don't know who you people are... Okay? But you need to let us go. We have the county sheriffs out there looking for us. And believe me, they will find us. If that is the case... ... then by the time they find us... ... we will be gone. What, does that mean you're gonna kill us? On the contrary. I'm offering to save you. Save us? Save us from what? This will, no doubt, come as a shock to you. But the world as you know it... ... will cease to exist... ... in a matter of weeks. Oh, Jesus, man. I knew it. This is some kind of fucked-up suicide cult, man. I knew it. Jesus Christ. You really expect us to believe this bullshit? Who are you people? We are a small group... ...of scientists, philosophers, mathematicians. Many of us have left behind very distinguished careers. We believe we will be the caretakers of our species... ...once the Earth has been purged. Oh, yeah? And who's telling you that? The formula. It is the key to our survival. It reveals verifiable proof... ...that our reality... ...is not random... ...but by design. We are being told that the grand unified design... ... has come to the end of a cycle. A rain of fire will descend from above... ... incinerating all life on Earth. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This is crazy, man. - This is crazy. This is crazy. - Hey. Mr. Hernandez. You were once a devout Catholic. Even considered the priesthood at one time, correct? Hey, I never... I never told anybody that. How do you know that? I never told anybody that. You are also a medical professional. A man who no doubt employs scientific methods on a daily basis. So would you not say that both God and science... ... can coexist in your vision? - Yeah, but... - Have you ever thought... ... that God may actually be both? I believe in the Bible. And you, Mr. Vaughn. A new child on the way. Was it God or science that made that possible? Hey, how...? Hey, how can he know that? - Did you tell him? - Who gives a fuck? Who gives a fuck? Or is it possible that God and science... ... could be one and the same for you as well? Listen to me, you asshole. I'm an atheist, okay? Now, you sick motherfuckers wanna kill yourselves, good luck. But let us go. Unfortunately, that's impossible. And why is that? No one can be left behind that has recent memory of our existence. Your recent recollection could entangle us... ... thus obliterating our transition before it even gets started. This is why I'm giving you this opportunity... ... not of a lifetime... ... but of a million lifetimes. You know what? I'm tired of listening to this bullshit. What are you afraid of, Mr. Vaughn? What I'm afraid of is my friend bleeding to death. So, what you're gonna do is you're gonna take him out of this room... ...and you're gonna stitch him up now. Nothing, huh? Dave. Dave, watch out! Dave! Dave. Dave, get up. - Thanks. - Have a good night, chief. I will. Thank you. - Evening. - Evening. Wonder if you could help me. I'm on the lookout for two paramedics. They answered a call in this area earlier this afternoon. You didn't happen to see an ambulance out this way, did you? You're the second person to ask me that. Police were by earlier. I'll tell you what I told them. I saw an ambulance. But they kept going down the road. Just thought it was an accident or something. Went down that way, huh? Yes, sir. Sirens blazing. About what time was that? Guess about 3:30, 4:00. Okay. Thanks a lot. Sure thing. Can I ask you, how long has that phone been out of service? - I didn't know it was. - Yeah. The receiver's missing. Well, guess I'll have to call the phone company. They maintain those sort of things. Not many people use them much anymore... ...with everyone carrying cell phones nowadays. - Mind if I use your restroom? - Sorry. Out of order. You might try the diner down the road. About three miles down. Make a right on Lake Road. You'll see it. Good meatloaf too. That is, if you're hungry. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna have a quick look around. Put my mind at ease. I got two men missing I'm responsible for, so I'm sure you'll understand. Son of a bitch. Hey. Hey. It's me. I should come in now. Things are heating up out here. Yeah. No, I have the canisters. There's no reason for me to stay. Okay. I'll see you soon. Bye. Dave. Dave, are you awake? Barely. How's your head? Are you okay? It's fucking throbbing. Sorry about what happened. It's okay. When I was 5, I had scarlet fever. I was dying. And my mom, she... She didn't have insurance. No money for doctors. So she took me to the priest and he... He prayed over me. Blessed me. Yeah, I know, Vic. I heard the story, buddy. My mom, she worked three jobs to put me through paramedic school. She'd come home in the middle of the night... ...her hands would look like raw meat. She was so proud of me. She told me one day that she wanted to give me something. It was a Saint Christopher medallion. Said that she had a vision. The Virgin Mary had come to her and told her... ...that as long as I wear this medallion... ...everything would be okay. My mom died two days before I graduated. Two days. I wanted her to see that. I wanted her to see that... ...so bad. The Teacher brought my mom back. Libby. That's not true, okay? Isn't that what you guys do... ...try to save people? Yes. Yes, we do, Libby. We're trained professionals. Okay? We have the right equipment. And even then, sometimes it doesn't work. Have you thought about... ...how he did it? I mean, how did he know about you and Deb... ...and your baby? I never told him. You never told him. How did he know that, Dave? I don't fucking know, Vic, all right? My mom says the Teacher can save all of us. Libby. Listen to me. No. The Teacher is like you and me, okay? - He's just a human. - How do we know that, Dave? How do we know that? How did he know about me? How did he know about my past? I never told him about wanting to be a priest. I never told you that. How did he know that about me? I don't know, Vic! All I know... ...is that... ...we gotta get the fuck out of here. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? That's all that matters, is getting the fuck out of here. What is that? The Teacher is preparing us. Our Father who art in heaven... ...hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on Earth, as it is in heaven. - Give us this day... - A lot of good that will do us. As we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation... ...but deliver us from evil. For thine is the power... ... the glory... ... forever and ever. Amen. I have an enormous sense of pride right now. I am looking at the chosen few... ...who will be the very seeds of a human genealogical tree... ...once we arrive at our new home. We will be reborn. Millions of years from now it will be your DNA... ...that courses through all of humanity. I wanna thank the Teacher... ...for giving us the formula which points to the undeniable truth. I want to thank you... ...for being true believers in a cause... ...which we are now only hours away from fulfilling. And lastly... ...I want you to remember those we leave behind... ...because we're doing this for them. Humankind will not be extinguished. And it is up to us to carry their memories... ...their hopes... ...their dreams with us. Our very existence will mean that the multitudes before us... ...have not lived in vain. To the formula. Undeniable truth. What do you want? Don't worry. We're not here to harm you. I need some water. You'll get plenty of water, Victor. We just need you to come with us now. Where are you taking him? Where are you taking him? Hey, Vic! Vic! Vic! You motherfuckers! Fuck. Fuck. Is going to sleep the same thing as dying? You seem sleepy. Where am I? You're safe, Victor. What are you doing? Alleviating your pain. What is...? What is this? For your own protection. It's only temporary. What are you doing? I think for myself. Come on. Hello, Victor. It's me, Rebecca. What do you want from me? I'm here to help you. You're a very lucky man, Victor. Why are you doing this to us? I'm here to offer you a chance to live forever. To become immortal. To become immortal. The formula has shown us the truth. The path to our own salvation as a species. Victor. You can join us in this new beginning. You can avoid absolute death. You can avoid absolute death. And the horrible fate that will be brought to this world... ...when the great fire descends from the sky. God... God will protect me. Did this God protect your mother, Victor? Did this God protect your mother, Victor? What about your little brother? God is physical truth, Victor. Those that pursue this truth through the numerical language of our creators... ...will know the real message... ...not the conjured one by the minds of men. A message that has always been there, right in front of us. We just needed the key to find it. That key... ... is the formula... ... by which the Teacher has blessed us. But, I saw you. You... You were dead. You are right. I was dead. That's when I saw the whole universe. All of humanity in a spray of light, numbers and noise connected. I saw myself below in my body and inside every star. But I did not go into the light. Victor. Do you believe in your resurrection? That you will leave this body behind to emerge in a better place? Yes. Do you believe that you will become immortal in heaven... ...whatever that may be? Yes. Were you not told that those left behind will suffer in hell... ...after the righteous are chosen by God? I was. Then you are already a believer, Victor. You have the conviction. All you need now is the truth on which to focus it. The formula has shown us this truth. And now, I will bring it to you. You will be reborn. Forget all that you've been taught about God... ...from those that have never seen him... ...and see him for yourself. The formula has shown us the truth. We must never forget it. How...? How...? How...? Listen to the message. If you believe... ...then you will understand. I don't wanna die. You will be loved, Victor, like never before. You will be loved, Victor, like you've never been loved before. How's that feel? - What happened? - Nothing. Come on. Where are we going? Wait. My mom 's... She said she's coming back... ...for me. - Listen. We're gonna go get help and then we'll come back for your mom. Look at me. You know a way out of here? - Do you know how to get outside? - I'm not sure. You gotta think, baby. We're running out of time. - There's one in the main hall. - Good girl. You ready? Okay. The room is ready, sir. Thank you, IO. When they say the eternal mystery of the universe... ...is its comprehensibility... Einstein. He was searching for God too. We will validate his dream, IO... ...as well as the dreams of billions of others. It is quite an honor, sir. Yes, it is. Start the final preparations. We must be brave. We must not falter. The beginning is near. Yes, sir. Okay. All right, Libby, is there a phone in here? No. Teacher doesn't like phones. Okay. What about a way out? Do you know of any? There's a door that way. I showed it to my mom. - We used it to get out. - Good girl. - Everyone report to the quadrant. - We gotta go baby. Come on. Everyone immediately report to the quadrant for entrance topside. Come on. - Responsible for a new evolution of the species. You are the chosen ones. Your belief in your mission is the sole hope for mankind. You are the caretakers of our greatest creation. Okay. This is it. - Okay. I'll be right behind you, okay? - Okay. Okay. Be careful. What the hell are they doing? Okay, Libby. Be careful, okay? - Okay. - Okay. She didn't believe. Then you can only remember her. When all this is gone... ...your memory will be all that remains to prove she ever existed. Okay, there it is. Let's go. Excuse me, sir. Mr. Vaughn has escaped. He's got Libby with him. What? No, no, no. We have to stop them. They'll be headed for the road. Get there before they do. We'll get them. Let's go. Does that mean we'll have to delay, sir? No, no. The window for us will close soon after sunrise. We have no choice but to stop them. Let's go. Everybody, inside. We have to begin to get ready. Yes, yes. Hold on. Shit. They're coming. Come on. Come on. Come on. Where's the phone? Oh, shit. No. Mr. Vaughn? Come on out, now. We don't want no trouble. - We know you're in there. - Hop in. Mr. Vaughn. Come out. Now! Get down, Libby. Get down. Okay. Hold on, okay? What are you doing? Go. Come on. Go. Go. Come on. They're after us. Son of a bitch. - Pull it over! - Fuck you! Pull it over, you son of a bitch! Come on. - Shit. - Go, go, go. Come on, Libby. Get up. Come on. Let's go. Hold on. Stop. Stop now! - Don't move. - Libby. Okay. Don't shoot. Please. Don't hurt her. - Libby, come to me. - No. - Come on. Come on. - Please don't. Don't hurt her. I will kill you if you hurt her. You understand me? - You're coming with us. - You know you've been brainwashed? - How hard is it? - Please be quiet. You fucking freaks. You don't know you've been brainwashed. - That's right. Get in the truck. - Yeah, okay. Don't you fucking hurt her! - Don't you fucking hurt her! - Get in the goddamn truck! Sir, we finally got them. What do you want me to do with Mr. Vaughn? Bring him in. The Teacher wants to see him. Yes, sir. Let's go, guys. Hello, baby. Mom, you feel so cold. You believe the Teacher wants to help us, don't you, Libby? What's wrong? How come you're talking different? Promise me... ...you won't try to run away again. I'm afraid to die, Mommy. The Teacher is your father... ...your flesh and blood. He would never do anything to hurt you. I promise. Everything's going to be just like he said it would be. Is Dave coming with us? Who? One of the men who tried to save us. I love you. Everything's going to be okay. I promise. Libby, it's time to go. Hello, Mr. Vaughn. I do apologize for the adjustment in protocol. But we have very little time... ...and I feel I owe it to you to give you one last opportunity... ...to reconsider. Where's my partner? What did you do with him? Victor is safe. You are my concern at the moment. What are you gonna do? Kill me? We're not murderers, Mr. Vaughn. We are survivors. Why are you doing this? As I explained to your partner... ...you must be purged. Usually, this is done over a period of a few days. But as we have less than an hour before our scheduled transition... ...we must accelerate our procedure. Again, my apologies. Now, this may hurt a little. But trust me when I say it's for your own good. That's it. - Please. - Clear your mind. We must erase a lifetime of misconceptions... ...in a matter of minutes. Mr. Vaughn... ...the truth is at hand. Accept it, or you will suffer along with the rest of humanity. Please. Your insular perception of reality is your worst enemy right now. The formula transcends this reality... ...transcends all time and space. It has shown us the impending fate of mankind. And the way out... ...for the few who choose to see it. Where's Vic, you son of a bitch? Victor is a believer. No. Dave? - It's me, Vic. - Vic? What'd they do to you, man? I've seen it. No. What the Teacher says is real. Don't fucking fall for it, Vic. - It's bullshit. - Mr. Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, you have to understand. We are not the ones living the lie... ...you are. Vic? It's me, man. I'll be right here, Dave. You don't have to be afraid. It only hurts for a little while. I'll wait for you. No, Vic. Don't say that, man. Come on, man, it's me. Vic. What the fuck did you do to him? Let me show you the way, David. - The way to your own salvation. - Fuck. Embrace the formula, David... ...and you embrace life everlasting. Go to hell. Numbers don't lie, Mr. Vaughn... ...people do. See that he's put to sleep. You'll have to take this now. You'll need to swallow. May you find peace. This is 1-8-2. I found the ambulance. It's on the side of the road off the 410 about a mile south of the Gas 'n' Go. No sign of the paramedics. We'll need a tow truck here. Over. Copy that, 1-8-2. Will advise. What the...? Oh, Jesus. Everyone please report to the Level 3 chamber immediately. I repeat, the Level 3 chamber immediately. Time to go, children. We've not much time. It's the moment we've been waiting for. Line up, everyone. Single file. Yes. Come, come. Let's go, Libby. You don't have to be scared. Your mother will be waiting for you. Very good. Okay, children. Follow me. Everything's going to be fine. Help. Anybody?! Is anybody out there? Help! This is it, my friends... ...the moment we've been working so hard to realize. Undeniable truth. If you look above you... ...you will see our Quanta sign. Our mission is to gather above... ...once we have extricated ourselves... ...from our physical bodies. Will it hurt? No, Thomas. It will be just like falling asleep. Remember, my friends... ...you will feel compelled to go into the white light. You must resist. This is the event horizon... ...which will lead to your absolute deaths. Stay above us here. Gather at the sign. Once we are unified... ...we will cross the threshold... ...for transference. Do you understand? Yes. Let us pray. Dear empirical God: We are humbled by your intelligence... ...and live our lives according to the sacred formula... ...you have given us. We are forever your creations... ...that are but a miniscule fragment... ...of the multiple universes you have designed. We will become the uniting energy we share with all things... ...thus becoming one with you. Oh, shit. What the...? What is all this shit? Fucking numbers, numbers. Vic? We will be together soon, my friends. Oh, God. Rebecca. Rebecca! Listen to me. Where's my partner? Wake up. Wake up. Where's my partner? Where's Libby? Hey! Look at me. Where's my partner? Where's Libby? Come on. Where are they? Where are they?! Please, Rebecca. I'm begging you. Look at me. Where are they? Please. They're downstairs. Vic! Vic! Victor. Where the fuck are you, man? Vic? Oh, God. - You okay? - Yeah. Okay, stay here. Step away from the door, Mr. Vaughn. You're endangering us all. Vic, come on, man. - Vic, man. Come on. - You're endangering us all. It's me, man. Come on. Let's go. - Step away from the door! - Shut the fuck up, IO! Shut the fuck up! Vic, come on, man. Don't do this. Vic. Vic. Motherfuckers. Mother... Vic. Oh, Vic. No, man. Vic! David. David? Oh, my God. I was so worried about you. Are you all right? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Baby, Vic... ...he's gone. Oh, my God. Put your seatbelt on. A metro girl has a new lease on life... ... thanks to surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children. Tracy Hooper was given the liver of a 9-year-old accident victim... ... in a four-hour operation. Hooper is in critical but stable condition. Normal after such an operation. Her condition will be... Hey. Breakfast is ready. Okay, thanks. Are you sure you're ready to do this? I'm sure that if you asked they'd let you have more time. No, I can't. It's been, like, a month. You know? I'm sitting at home, my mind is just racing. I can't do it anymore. I gotta go back. Well, I love you. I love you too. Oh, hey, Libby has a surprise out there for you, so, you know... ...act surprised. - Okay. - Hi, Uncle Dave. - Good morning, beautiful. Wow, this is nice. Who do we have here? He's the cook, she's the waitress, he's the butler... ...and she's a singer. - A singer? Wow, this must be a fancy restaurant. Let me guess. You're the boss? I'm the manager. Oh, good. So the manager can help me clean up the restaurant. Aunt Deb said I could take my dolls with me to see Mommy at the hospital. She did? L... l... I forgot to tell you. It'll be okay. What's going on out there? Libby, don't run out in the street, hon. - What the hell is that? - Check this out. What's going on out there? - What is it? - I don't know. Everyone's in the street. - Never seen anything like it before. There's absolutely no high-pressure activity around... That's incredible. Have you ever seen anything like this? - It can't be. - Uncle Dave. It looks like fire. Dave, I think we should go inside. Dave. It's impossible. David. David.
