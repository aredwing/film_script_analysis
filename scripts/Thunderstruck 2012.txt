Haw did you get open for that game winner? - Now, that's a secret. We gotta go. - Agents. Agents. Yeah, well, the secret worked tonight, guys. Back to you. Hey, KD!

Kevin, before you go... Hey, man. Sc I hacked the web-vite for Stacy King's party and we're in. You're kidding me. Well, I put us dawn for a "maybe" so it wasn't obvious. You actually hacked into somebody's web-vite'? Well, would you rather sit home Saturday? No, no. I mean, I'd rather just-- I think it's-- Where will we--? Yeah. Her name is Isabel Sanchez. Oh, yeah. She just moved here from Denver. Her dad is some engineer working an a project... ...over at Gallagher Communications. How did you--? Did you actually talk to her? She's the hottest new girl that's moved here since Cindy Wilson in the sixth grade. Everybody in my "World of Warcraft" guild was texting about it after we saw her. Although, I could have a couple facts wrong. She could be visiting from Los Angeles with her mom... who's a flight attendant. Her name is definitely Isabel. Nat sure about the Sanchez, though. Do you want me to try to hack into the school server to find out for sure? I'm a nerd, Bri. I'm okay with that. I embrace it. I'm gonna talk to her. Goad. You have three years to keep that dream alive. Just like making the basketball team. And like I said, I admire your optimism, I do, but-- Whoa! Wait. Now? Look, she's new. She doesn't know anything about me. I have a clean slate. Ugh. Hey, hey, everybody, watch this. Why are we doing this again? - Because I wanna dunk like KD. All right, ready? Hang time, baby. Whoo! Whoa! That hurt. - Aww. - Help. Ashley, get that camera out of my face. Hang Time! Hang Time! Hang Time! Hey, Josie, wait up. Connor is a jerk. You're not gonna tell me to ignore him, are you? What? Na way. I would say give him hell. You know, if you were bigger, or richer, or more talented. - But, well, he's a jerk. - Thanks. .Hey- .Hey- - Heard you had a rough day. - Yep. - Can I try to cheer you up? - Doubtful. That's tan bad. I was gonna see if you wanted to go to the Thunder game. - Really? - Really. T-shirts! Souvenirs! T-shirts! Souvenirs! You know, this whale "cheer me up" thing just might work. I kind of hoped it might. Get 'em, get 'em Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em And my team gonna ride tonight Okay, 13 and 14. This is us.

Came an. Yes! Kevin Durant an an absolute tear tonight. Unbelievable, Marv. He's in a great groove, playing with so much confidence. I don't know if we've seen him play better. What's impressed me is haw he continues to improve every part of his game... ...bath offensively and defensively. Something I'm sure that opponents of the Thunder are not very happy to see. Yeah. Like tonight. That's the end of the first half with our scare... ...the Thunder, 51, the Detroit Pistons, 31. You see the crossover move when he went around the guy with eight minutes left? That was just sick. See, Dad, that's his counter 52 move. You pay this much attention to your math class? Because if you did, we'd be talking academic scholarship to Harvard. Dad, Kevin Durant doesn't teach my math class. Goad paint. Thunder fans, get out your ticket stubs. It's time for one lucky Oklahoma City fan... ...to take our MidFirst Bank half-court shot.

It's me, isn't it? - Sending me a message? - I'm not sending you a message. - I'm in a slump. That's all it is. - A slump? You seen a slump before? That's where I'm at right now. - Okay. Slump. - Yeah. All right, a slump. A slump. - I'm sure Kobe has went O for 17 too - I was one for 17. Correction, one for 11. One.

But if he gets the pick, then I need you to get up in his grill... ...farce him dawn to the baseline, and trap him in the corner. Gut it? - Oh, I gut it, coach. - All right. Now, let's run it again. And this time, don't suck. - Yeah, don't suck. - Play to your potential. - Keep it crisp. - Pick him up. Yeah, I'm an him. - A little harder with that pass. Ball! Ball! Ball!

A local player from right here in Oklahoma City could be the next Kevin Durant. You can do it! He looks like the old Kevin Durant, not the current KD. Nobody knows who that guy is.

Fifty-two paints against the second-best team in the district. Yeah. I mean, it was like watching you play if you was 14 years old. Sn, what are you trying to say, man? I don't know.

That was insane. Appreciate that. It was nice meeting you, but I gotta get going. - I gut a game tonight. - Oh, okay. Wait, wait. Ha, whoa, ha, ha. - What about the free shoes? - What free shoes? New kicks. New shoes. A pair of black monsters of destruction. He's talking about his shoes there. - Yeah. - Yeah, I gut that. You know, I remember... I remember my last pair of new shoes. Lang time ago. It was right before I scared 21 paints. - Twenty-one? - It was a great game... ...against Wayne County Dance and Technical. - Never knew what hit them. - I'm telling you. - Na footage an it though, unfortunately. - They only had film. You know, I'm primarily known as a high school coach... ...but as you can see, the way I elevated Brian's play... -...I think my skill set translates to NBA. - Oh, is that right? Sc if there's any tips you need, you all right? I'm good. But I'll keep you in mind. Are you stretching? Are you stretching before the game? You've been stinking up the court I thought- - You guys should take a picture. - Sure, of course. You don't mind, do you? - Na. Bri, why don't you be in the middle? - Okay. Yeah, nu, right there. There you go, beam. All right, guys- Wait, wait. All right, guys, smile. - Coach. - There we go. Listen, do you think you could sign this for me? Yeah. What's your name? Coach Z. Can you put "ta my best buddy"? You're not my-- But all right. B-E-S-T.. - I can spell. - Yeah, of course, of course, of course. - There you go. - Hey, thanks. - All right. -om Hey, that's your coach? Goad luck with that. Haw do you--? Haw do you feel after being around him? Dc you feel, like, different? You know, like the old you? I feel pissed at my agent because he got me at a school knowing I got a game tonight. I just thought if you guys were around each other... ...things would go back to the way they were. This kid has something to do with what happened. Think this isn't hard an me? Think I don't hear what they're saying an TV? In the newspapers? In the locker roam? I hear it. - I know. - The players tan, they're trash talking. - It's been tough an me tan, man. - I know. I know. You dc? This isn't helping. Being here isn't helping. - Or sticking needles in my back. - What about calling your mam? Definitely not helping. You keep smiling like it's funny. You're not helping the situation at all. - KD. - Hey, I'm driving myself home. All right, Brian, bring it up. - Yeah! - Ga, Brian! Ga, Brian! Whoa! Come on. - Bring it dawn. - Ga! Take it in - Brian. - Open up. He's open. - Brian. - Open. - Brian. Over here, Brian. Brian. What's he doing, coach? What's he trying to dc? What he's doing, man? Came an. Oh! What? Booya! Yeah! What the hell are you doing, dude? Trying to make me lack like an idiot, man? - Whoa! - Knack it off. Knack it off. - What's he doing? - On the bench. Grab somebody. - What's your name? - Del Negraw. Del Negraw, came an, check in. He couldn't make our freshmen team before. Hey, you still get an assist, right? You made an assist. Now, pass around. Let's have some fun out there. Shoat it! Yeah! Whoa! Three! Unbelievable. That's my bay out there. Hey, man, I know haw you feel. When I was playing high school basketball... ...I was the one making the baskets. And then Michael Jordan transferred into our high school. He was the one making the baskets. I had to pass to Mike. I had to stomach it. - Really? - Na, but it's a good story. - Meaningful. - Coaching is about inspiration. With the Thunder an the verge of missing the playoffs... ...due to the total collapse of Kevin Durant. It's unbelievable. But, Reggie, you were one of the great shooters of all time... ...but you had a slump like this new and then. Don't go there, Steve. First of all, I've never shat the ball this bad. Wait. Never in your entire career? Blindfold, in this tie, in this suit... -...I can shunt better than this kid. - Oh, man. Call up everybody, it's a party over here Got my ladies We sexy, our hands up in the air Yeah. Oh! Oh! Did I tell you about the time I did the fake pass... ...between-the-legs dribble and pulled up with the three? Dude, that was awesome. You rack. Is it normal for one player to take all the shots? If he's the best player an the team, why not? Yeah. Whoa! Yeah. Isabel. Came an. What's wrung? - Don't be like that. - Like what? Let's get out of here. Ga and talk. Like you said you wanted at the go-kart track. I've been talking all night. - I know. Just not to me. - Brian. Oh, ha, ha! - Yeah! - Yeah! Brian! Brian! Brian! Hey, Bri, it's me. Again. Just trying to see where you are. You know, we're supposed to go to Monica Janakowski's party tonight. Wait. You're probably in the shower. Lack, it's okay. Just please give me a call, all right? Give me a call. Coal. Oh, these are nice. Brian! Brian! Brian! I am a basketball god! - Has anybody seen Isabel? - I think she went home. - She did? - Mm-hm. Parent! Somebody's dad's coming! Out of the way. Excuse me. Thank you. Nice shorts. - Lack, you need to give it back. - Mr. Garrett? You have Kevin Durant's talent. Well, thank you. I'm not even saying you did it on purpose, or you even know... ...but I'm telling you and new you know. Know what? Because I'm pretty confused. You stole Kevin Durant's talent. Oh, he's Kevin Durant's agent, not somebody's dad. - Dad. What? - He's not a parent! It's coal! A parent, really? Sn, what do you want? You stole Kevin Durant's talent! - Let's talk. - Yeah. Lack, Mr. Garrett-- Sir, that's crazy, okay? It's nuts. Really? Don't you think this is all kind of strange? Your talent? Your sudden talent? I blossomed. You know, Michael Jordan got cut from his high school team sophomore year. Every kid who's ever sucked hangs an to that story. Look, when MJ gut cut from varsity... ...he then tare up JV with a bunch of 40-paint games. Haw many paints did you scare before meeting Kevin at halftime that night? None. I didn't play. Fine. The game before that? None. I wasn't an the team yet. Freshman year, last year, what was your scaring average? - I didn't make the freshman team. - New what's your scaring average? Forty-eight paints a game. Exactly my paint. Kevin Durant hasn't missed a layup since he was your age. New he can't even make one? Why? Why are you trying to ruin everything? I know this is important to you, I dc. But that talent you new have is not yours. Na, you're wrung, okay? You're wrung. It's not magic or whatever you think it is, okay? - I worked for this. - Na, you wished for it. And you know what the worst thing is? You let down this entire community. All of Oklahoma City. Everybody who loves the Thunder and Kevin. Every fan who cheer each win and ache each lass. Just like you did with your dad. Make it I'm gonna make it, make it Make it out there I'm gonna make it, make it Make it out there I know I'm gonna get Get far away I! I! I believe! I believe! I believe that! I believe that! I believe that we! I believe that we! I believe that we will! I believe that we will! I believe that we will win! I believe that we will win! I believe that we will win! I believe that we will win! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think you've noticed some changes around here, haven't you? Like a winning basketball team? Yeah! Well, let me tell you. Let me tell you something. There's one thing that won't change. And that's what Coach Dan and I are wearing. We are going to wear our game day suits till we win the state championship. Yeah! All right. We are one game away. One game! That's right. One game. One game away... ...ta the state playoffs for the first time-- First time! Hey, let me have this. I'm the coach, okay? Can I have this? Yeah. For the first time since I scared nine paints... ...ripped three boards against South Gate... ...32 years ago. - That was a great game. - Yeah. I wasn't barn yet. Now, are you ready to meet our Eagles? Yeah! Are you ready? Let's bring them cut. - Connor O'Brien! - Whoa! Derek Nader! Isabel, hey. Hey, listen, I've been trying ta... - You're not staying for the pep rally? - I'm going to the library. Well, I've been trying to call you. Why'd you leave the party the other night? - I didn't think you'd notice. - I did. Lack, maybe after basketball season, we can hang but. Why would you say that? Brian, when I first met you- And now for the star of our team --you were-- - Brian Newall! - Yeah! Goad luck, Brian. Oh, came an. Lack, before this, you wouldn't even have noticed me. - Basketball is the only reason you did. - Brian Newall. I noticed you the first day when I walked dawn the hallway. By your locker, talking to Mitch. And it definitely wasn't because of basketball. Well, maybe we're not cheering laud enough for Brian. Brian Newall! Brian! Brian! Brian! Ga an. Your fans need you. Brian! Brian! Brian! Came an dawn, Brian. Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian Newall! What are you still doing here? Coach, haw close was I to making the team? What, the first time? Well, a lot closer than Pete Stickney. Isn't he legally blind in one eye? You see, I don't judge like that, Brian. You see a disability, I see a weak paint guard. That's all. Lack, Brian, I'm not one of those touchy-feely kind of coaches, you know. - I'm really uncomfortable with it-- - Yeah, I've noticed that. You think Bobby Knight would be in the hall of fame... ...if he tossed around compliments instead of chairs? - I don't even know who that is. - Okay, I'm gonna forget you even said that. Here's the paint. It doesn't matter haw you gut here. You gut here. You know, my dad, he thought I was a weak athlete. He wanted to strengthen me up a little bit. Sc he did a code red an me. Wake me up at 3 a.m. every day, made me do extra laps. - Your dad did that to you? - Might have been a movie I saw. Paint is, I still got that juco scholarship. I'm just glad that whatever you did, you did. The whale school is. - If I had your talent, bay-- - My talent. What? What? Nothing. One more game, we'll be in the state playoffs. - Haw good does that sound? - Tan good to be true. Tan good to be true. Hey, I'm proud of you. Thanks, coach. You did good. You did good for all of us. And I'm glad of what you brought to me tan. - Yeah. - Okay. - We've had our talk? - Yeah. You're coal? All right. Eat well, hydrate. I'm counting an you. Hey, it's me. - Sc, what do we dc? - You'll see. Haw long has he been here? Almost three hours. And he isn't getting any better. Came an. Ya, KD! Man, what's he doing here? - I wanna give your talent back. - You gut him believing this nonsense tan? That's it. I told you it wasn't helping in the first place. After the season, we gonna sit dawn to have a talk. Show him. - Show me what? Watch this. Get out there and play. Show him the counter 52. Okay, okay. He got some skills. So what? He's watching my YouTube videos. He's right. But you see, when I used to try to do those moves, I'd hurt myself. Hurt myself a lat. And messed up the garage. All right. All right. Crossover. You ain't going nowhere. - Okay, maybe he's a prodigy. - Na. Na, nu. Listen, show him the KD 35 live special. Nobody can do that. I can't do that anymore. Watch. Came an, man. What you gut? - Whoa. - That kid's good. - You convinced? - Yeah. Sn, what are we gonna do now? Ah! Okay. Say what y'all said before. I wish I had your talent. Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard. I felt it. You felt-- You feel it? I felt it. It was here. Let's take a shat. Came an. Faster, faster. We need a spark. Okay. Yeah. Rub-- Rub the feet. Rub the feet. - New say it. - I wish I had your talent. Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard. Keep rubbing. Keep rubbing. Keep rubbing. Okay, new touch fingers. - Felt that? - Duh. All right, let's try it. Came an. Short. Wishbone. Let's make a wish. - I wish I could give your talent back. - I wish to get my talent back. Alan, this is not working. - It's not working. - Well, just- Trust me. Touch the ball... -...and just say what you said before. - I wish I had your talent. Hard works beats talent when talent fails to work hard. - Whoa! - Oh! Ah! Now, that worked. That worked. That had to work. Take a shat. Take a shat. Watch this. I like haw you did that. Give it back. - Okay, okay. All right, all right. - Give it back. We tried. I didn't do it an purpose. I know, Brian. I guess I gotta start all aver as a basketball player. A new KD. It isn't gonna be easy. Or in time for the season. Yeah, yeah, yeah --needing a win at home in their final regular season game... ...just to make the playoffs. Are you guys watching the same thing I'm watching? He can't buy a shat out there. Judging by these warm-ups, he's not gonna be any good to anyone. Reggie, I hate to say this, but this has gone an tan lung. He's played so pearly for the last month or so. You sit him dawn. Take him out of the lineup. Pretty dramatic, to take a superstar out of the lineup at this paint. - Bench him completely? - Yeah. Bench him. Hey. Look, I know I was a jerk and really self-centered... ...but mast of all, I'm sorry. - Ga an. - I was kind of hoping that covered it all. - You can do better. - Maybe. But you're not gonna believe it. Try me. - Could I came inside and show you? - Sure. Well, thank you. Sc this basketball player-- Kevin Durant. --His talent switched to you? And your talent became his talent? See, I told you you wouldn't believe me. Well, I'm not stupid, Brian. Isabel, lack, my basketball coach... ...he didn't even know my name before all this. And I was the team manager, okay'? I was that bad. Just watch this shat, okay? Watch this shat. That is one bad shat. Yeah, I know, okay? Wait. We're gonna watch that again, all right? There. Did you see that? Did you see that? - What? - That's it. Haw did I not think of it? That's it. That's it. Brian. Bri.. Brian. He left. And at the end of the half, Thunder, 31, New Orleans Hornets, 53. Goad! Hey! Hey, kid! Came back here! I gut a kid an the louse dawn here. - Move, move, move! - Hey, kid, come back. Watch cut. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop him! - Ya! Hey, kid, where you going? What are you doing? Get back-- Hey. What are you doing? Whoa! Hey. Hey! Kevin. Kevin. Hey, Kevin, look, look, l figured it out. I know why it didn't work last time. - I gotta hit Rumble with the ball first. - Well, there he is. Okay. I put my hands an the ball and you say: -"I wish I had your talent." - I wish I had your talent. Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard. Ga! - Brian. - We gotta get you out of here. Oh, he's with me, he's coal. He's coal. He's coal. New you know. Yes! Kevin Durant drills it. He's hit his last three shuts. Are you kidding me? He's making those shots? I don't know what happened, but suddenly, everything's changed. More importantly, he's making those shuts. Kevin Durant is back. Kevin Durant! Finally, it's a good day to be a Thunder fan here in Oklahoma City... ...as last night, Kevin Durant just broke out of his slump... ...scoring 32 big points in the second half... ...hitting a three-pointer at the buzzer as the Thunder come back in grand style... ...and beat the Hornets- Let's go. Hey, that's my "Warcraft" card. You can't use it. That spell doesn't do more damage. This damage... - Goad game tonight, Brian. - What's up, Bri? Hey. All right. So when we charge Admiral Ripsnarl... ...in Heroic Deadmines for the achievement, I'll run in and grab the agro... ...and the mage can work on rounding up the Vapors. I hope Smite's Reaver drops. Hey, what are our chances? Uh, I'm getting about 32.33, repeating, of course, percentage of survival. - It's risky. - Yeah, well, I think it's bald. The other way to go is Steve uses his dwarf paladin. Fine. Ignore me. I know what I did was the jerkiest thing... ...since Leeroy Jenkins screwed his guild by running in without them. Och. So I hope you-. You had me at Leeroy Jenkins. Brian? - Ha! Can we talk? Um... I kind of just sat dawn. Okay. Yeah? Thanks. Isabel, wait up. The hat new girl and the star of the basketball team... at our "Wow" meeting? That's cooler than when Mitch solo-tanked Yogg-Saron in Ulduar... ...in his Tier 12 armor set. Han! I was watching the basketball game with my dad last night, and I saw you. Then all the announcers talked about was haw Kevin suddenly caught fire. Sn, what you told me was true? Yeah, but I don't have his talent anymore. - Well, what are you gonna dc? - I don't know. - I'm gonna be awful. - Na, you won't. Yeah, I will. You'll figure something cut. This is it. This your moment. Our moment. Out in that gym tonight. Dc you hear that? That's for you. And you. And me. Tonight is why I turned down an opportunity... ...to be an assistant manager at Walmart six years ago... ...ta be a high school basketball coach tonight. And then I turned down a marketing job at Cisco. That one I regretted for a while, but not now. Nat tonight. This is what we play far. - A chance to go to state! - Yeah! Brian, wanna say something to the team? - Ga ahead. - Me? You were the key to our turnaround, kid. Ga ahead. Okay. Well, let's go out there... ...and let's give it our best, okay? If we win, great. But if we lose, we tried. We tried. Yeah, but we're gonna win. Yeah. - All right. Bring it in. Bring it in. Yeah, but if we don't, for some reason... .sometimes, just going out there and trying your best is enough. And getting really, really close, pretty darn satisfying. - But we're gonna win. - Yeah. Hopefully. - One, two, three. Eagles! - Eagles! Let's go, let's go. All right! - Ga, Eagles! - Came an, Eagles! Shoot it! Put it up! What's going an? Shunt it, Brian. Brian, shunt, shunt! - Pick it up. - Shunt it. Okay. Bad pass. Bad pass. Dude, just don't pass to me, all right? I'm covered. - You were wide open. - The dude's guarding me. I don't know. It's like he read our playback. That's it, press him. Come on, Brian. Shunt it, baby! Shunt it, Brian! Shunt it! - Grab it! - What's he doing? Let's go, let's go. Oh, nu, nu. Time cut. Time cut. Get in here. Bring it in. Bring it in. Came an, came an. Yeah, yeah, it's a championship. He's nervous. Bring it in. Bring it in. Bring it in. Newall, came here. What's going an? What's going an? You're not playing like yourself. - Coach, who's he playing like? - Nat himself. - Nat yourself. - Yeah, actually, I am. Na, you're nut. - I'd bench me. - What, are you nuts? You're the best player an this team. You're the horse that got us here and we're gonna ride you home. All right? Now, go out there and do anything that doesn't suck. All in. - One, two, three. Don't suck! - Don't suck! Come on. Loosen up. You'll be fine. You'll be fine. - Goad speech. - Than ks. All right, hold them, guys, hold them. Came an. Black it. Black it. Hold them up. Hold them up. Hey! Take it, take it, take it. It's all right. Pull it together, guys. Pull it together. Let's go. D-up, now, D-up. All right, bring it back. Let's go. Ga, take it. Hustle. Hustle. Ga an. Ga an. Move it around. Move it around. Came an. That's it. - Yeah! - Stuff it in! And at the end of the third quarter, the scare is the Drillers, 41... ...and our own Eastview Eagles, 35. I don't know what to say. - Coach, you gut something to say? - Yeah. Yeah. Forget about the crowds... ...the size of the school, their fancy uniforms. Remember what gut you here. Focus an the fundamentals that we've gone aver time and time again. Coach, is that from Hoosiers? Yeah. You guys see that? Oh. Well, then I've gut nothing. Ahem. Okay, came an. Let's go out there now. And be good, don't be bad. - One, two, three. Don't suck! - Don't suck! All right, let's go. Listen, now, this is your time here, all right? If you can't play what you had, play what you got. Your time, not mine. Hey. guys, bring it in. You just saw Hoosiers? - Is it Old'? -1986. I thought Gene Hackman looked younger. - Lack, we can still do this. - Haw? - You're having the worst game of your life. - He's right. I'm not an my game. You can't do it by yourself. All right, so why don't we do it together as a team? All right, we full-court press the rest of the game and dive for every louse ball. Five guys go up for every rebound. They may have more talent tonight, but you know what we got? We gut more heart. All right, so let's bring it here and let's go. Eagles an three. One, two, three. Eagles! Get into press! Eagles! - Let's do it. - Let's go. - Pick him up, pick him up. - What's he doing out there? - He's taken leadership. - All right, pressure the ball. Trap it right there. Trap it, trap it. Grab it.
