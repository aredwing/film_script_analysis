I should just go now. Welcome, Tara. Hello? Are you ready to play... for the chance to win a modeling contract? I thought I was, but- You'll have 60 seconds to complete the task... or pay the price. The price? There-there's a-a bit of a mistake. There are two buttons in the next room- red and green. It's your task to push both of them... in sequence, opening the case... that contains the modeling contract. Red, then green. In 60 seconds or less, Tara. Fifty seconds. Fuck! Where are you? Where's the red button?! This can't be right. You don't expect me to hurt myself, do you? Forty seconds. Thirty seconds. Ten seconds. Tara, are you scared? Fuck you! Beginning to be the boy that cried wolf, detective. Yeah, well, maybe if you'd gotten here... a little sooner. You still wouldn't have taken him down. He was long gone. This is a crime scene. I'm gonna have to ask you to step out. Special agent Christine Robison. I assume you got the paperwork. Yeah, they said they were gonna send a headshrinker. I don't know why. I never asked the feds for help. Criminal profiler. And, no, you didn't ask for help. And maybe that's why... this guy's been able to run these shows... for the past two years. Go on, detective. Blind me with your insight. I'm here to help, Detective Bowman. Nothing more. This is still your case. I've seen crimes of passion... there's crimes of hate... profiled guys that couldn't control their urge to kill. This guy... this guy's methodical in his planning... ruthless in his execution. You saw the files on this case? How? They weren't even- The FBl's been keeping track of this case. How'd you find the place? Call came in to me. We're here because he wants us to be here. He wants us to know something. What? That the game's started again. Hello? Is anyone there? Can anyone hear me? Anyone there? Anyone? Hey. Are you ok? Who are you? Calm down. How did I get here? I swear I don't know, all right? I just woke up myself. But the last thing I remember is walking home. Oh, my God. What is this? Is this some kind of a joke?! Look, I don't know. But it better be. Did you just hear that? Tell me you just heard that. Maybe... maybe you should go check it out. Maybe you should go fuck yourself. Oh, this place is unbelievable. What a shithole. Hey. Somebody's watching. No, this dump's been abandoned for years. There's no way that camera still works. Really? Man, this place is messing with my head. Why the fuck am I here?! Why did you bring me here, man?! Whoa, take it easy, man. We didn't bring you here. Hey! Calm down, all right? We're just trying to figure all this out right now. Calm down. Who are you? Jason. You? Kelly. I'm Brandon. Hey, nice cage. Fuck you, man! Hey, I'm kidding. Come on, man. We'll get you out of here. Hey, you get cut? Oh, my God. No. Man, I ain't down with that. Come on! Somebody jammed the handle. Thanks, man. Sure thing. Oh, great. Just great. Another dead end. Man, quit your bitchin'. Ain't nothin' keeping me here. Jesus! I think it's just best not to touch anything right now. Ya think? Hello! Hello! Fuckin' anybody?! We thought we were the only ones here. What's going on? How did we get here? I have no idea what's going on. Yeah, Hansel and Gretel. What, you lose your breadcrumbs? This your little handiwork, son? Huh, partner? Look, it's Dylan and Cherie... and no, we had nothing to do with that shit. Jason, relax. Lay off the coffee, man. All I know is I better get... a bang-up explanation for this shit... or I'm going to Norfolk ping-pong them motherfuckers. How did you guys get here? We went for a couple beers after work... and then we woke up here. Man, what I know is... I'm smokin' a blunt in my house. Next thing you know, I'm in this shithole. Hey, if you guys are finished getting acquainted... maybe we could try to find a way out of this dump. He's right. - He's right. - Ok. Honest Christian motherfuckers. Oh, God. Do you see her? Do you see her there? Hello? Hey, are you ok? Ah, hell, nah! It's ok. Are you all right? Hey, we're not gonna hurt you. I'm Brandon. Don't! Yo, ice princess. What's up with that? He was just trying to help you. We're not here to hurt you. Welcome to "Are You Scared?" The reality show? This is it? So we're on TV, like, right now? Aw! Jesus. Put that on prime time. I fuckin' dare you. Yeah! I applied months ago. I never even heard back from them. I thought the whole thing was bullshit. I just was in it for the money. We never signed consent forms. They can't do that. Can they? I mean, we're here now. Clearly there's a way around the paperwork. No. My mom's a lawyer. She'll know. Oh, my God! My cell phone. My cell phone's gone! I hope you kept the receipt! Who's doing this? Let me explain the rules of the game. You'll each face your worst fear... and if you complete your challenge... you'll go through to the final showdown. This is live TV at its finest. There are games for all and prizes galore. Nobody leaves here empty-handed. Your family and friends are watching... so do them proud. Challenge yourself to conquer your innermost fears... and one player will walk away with the ultimate prize. If everyone's ready, let the games begin. Jason, please join me. Yeah! Let's rock this mother! See ya at the showdown! Yeah, boy! Time to make that money, baby! So, what are you afraid of? I told them I was shit-scared of the dark, you know? Something's not right here. Something's totally not right. You know, I probably should've made something up. Don't you think? Told 'em... like I was afraid of sex or something? So, what are you scared of? If you grew up with my dad... you'd realize there's not much left to be scared of. All right? Ok. Sorry. I didn't mean to be personal. No, it's ok. I'm just here for money... so me and my mom can move, again. I told them on my tape I was scared... someone would find out my secret. Your secret? What is it? It wouldn't be a secret if I told you, would it? Ok. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah, can't sweat it, dog. Can't sweat it, dog. Hey, yo, man, I must say... I love what you did to the place, man. Extra dusty. Just the way I like it, man. You know what I'm sayin'? So you know... what you want me to do? Like eat some worms or somethin'? Oh! What is this? Oh! Oh, yo! This is tight, though, man. This is ill though, man. Oh! This is a sexy man, though. What! You want me on your show. You need me on your show... because I'm a freakin' superstar. Look at me out there. Jason! Yeah! And to answer that thing y'all had to ask... like what am I scared of? All right, I got this thing about being, like... awake during an operation... you know. That'd just- freak the living crap out of me, man. Are you ready to play? Oh, fuck, yeah, man! Oh, this here's on delay, right? 'cause-'cause I just said "fuck. " You understand that? Face your worst fear, Jason. Yo, man, put it on the table, Jack! Here's how the game works. There's an explosive device in the next room. A what? An explosive? Come on, you're shittin' me. Ok, you can't do that on TV, can you? You have one minute to find the only key... that can stop the countdown. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, man. I'm not going in there. Man, you can't make me go in there. Shit! Shit! You could've burnt me, man! That was fuckin' outrageous! It's nitrous oxide. Inhale enough, and it'll put you right to sleep. Too little, and you'll be awake, but paralyzed. Too much, and you won't wake up at all. What the hell is going on? You don't expect me to put myself to sleep, do you? Man, what kind of fucking reality show is this?! Forty-five seconds to find the key... and stop the countdown. Man, oh! Shit! Shit, shit! I'm suing someone! Anyone! Oh, no. You gotta be kidding me! You sick bastard! Thirty seconds. Where is it? Twenty seconds. Might be time to start the anesthetic, Jason. Ten seconds. The first cut is the deepest, Jason. I'm not doing it. I don't wanna play this fucking game! You can take this bullshit show and stick it up your ass! Time's up. Thank you for playing, Jason. They've all been reported missing today? This morning. The game's started. Well, we're set up for a trace when he calls. And he'll call. He always does. He records everything. Relives their pain over and over. Maybe he's in pain himself. Jesus, I hope so. He's trying to teach them a lesson. A merciful death is better than a life of pain. Tough lesson to learn. Give it time. We haven't gotten any physical evidence... from the crime scenes. Not a partial... not a fingerprint, nothing. He led us this far. He wants us to know what he's doing. He's proud. He's a crazy fuck. He's patient, analytical, thorough... You sound like you wanna start his fucking fan club. Let me guess. Nothing? Maybe. Maybe not. Looks like... A shipping number. What happened to Jason? How come he's not back yet? Cherie, you're doing that thing again. What thing? That whiny-ass thing. Time for round two. Who's next up? I don't wanna do this anymore. I want out. I think I wanna leave now. I say we all agree that no one accepts another challenge... until we talk to whoever's in charge. Second it. Is this like that island show? Secret pacts and truces? I don't vote you off, you don't vote me off. Is that it? I have a terrible feeling that this isn't a game. Of course it's a fucking game! Jesus Christ! Cherie, come on. Let's get this over with. Dylan, I think we should wait. All we have to do is talk to the producers... and make sure everything goes ok. Fuck! Why did we apply? The show is called "Are You Scared?" I mean, what did you expect from this place? Aw, fuck it. I'm ready. Excellent, Dylan. But for your challenge, we need you and your sister. Come on, sis. Don't pussy out on me. Look, we're this far. Let's go. We're doing this. You don't have to do this. I do. Cherie. Dylan, I really don't wanna do this. What are you gonna do, Cherie? You gonna stand here... till I agree to go home with you? Yeah. Ok, look. Do you remember the first time we ever got drunk? We were, like, and we stole that peach schnapps from the kitchen. You remember that? You got so sick. You threw up all night. You thought you were gonna die. And I stayed up with you, and I promised... I was gonna take care of you. And I did. Look, I'll promise you right now... I will take care of you. Nothing is gonna happen. Let's go. Do you remember the next day when mom found... the empty bottle and she blamed it all on me? You know what? I told you... I would take care of you that night. I never said you wouldn't take the fall. No shit! Holy shit! They're not fucking around here! Dylan, I don't think like this. You wanna go home? I think we should. No! We're not going home. Come on. I think we should go. That's a good-looking man. What's up? My name's Dylan... and this is my sis-Cherie. We're twins, but we're not the identical kind. Duh. They can see that we're twins. Fuckwit. That's what got us the audition. That's what got us here. I'm not really scared of anything... but I think your show sounds sweet... so I wanna give it a shot. I'm scared of losing my brother... because he is the closest person to me. You're a dork. That's pretty much the lamest thing I've ever heard. Please, enter the game. Let's go. Dylan, this is too much. I can't do this. Oh, Cherie, for fuck's sake. We're doin' it. Failure to take a seat would result... in automatic disqualification. No choice. Dylan, let's go home-now! Now attach the handcuffs to your left wrist... and the collar restraint around your neck. Cherie, sit down. We're doing this. I don't think we should be here. Kelly, I'm telling you to stay. Let go. Where are you going? I'm gonna go find out who's in charge. You don't know how to find out who's in charge. I don't care. I'm so tired of standing around here. But-but we need to stay together. I'll be right back. Hey, I got a light! That's it, Cherie. Cherie and D. On the way to victory. Let's do it! You in, Cherie? If you'd both reach under the armrest... with your right hands... Dylan, please press your on button. Holy fucking shit! Fuck! As I'm sure you're already aware... you can stop your drill at any time... but one of them will always be working. Make your choice. We really shouldn't be doing this. We could be disqualified from the game. What's that noise? What is it? Don't! Fuck! Don't. Dylan! Dylan! Cherie! Get out of there, guys! It's not worth it! What the fuck is going on in there, you guys?! Dylan, I won't let you do this. No! No! No! Get out of there! For the love of God, stop this! Dylan! Cherie, drop the remote. No! Just drop it, please, for me. No! Please drop your remote. No! Get out of there! Cherie, please, for me, for me, drop the remote! No! No! Drop it! No! Please, Cherie. Cherie, you have to drop your remote. No, Dylan, no! I won't let you do this! No! I won't let you. Oh, God. Turn off the drills right now. Turn 'em off! Do you hear me?! Cherie, turn it off! Turn it off! No, I won't let you. Please, for me, drop it! No! Drop the fucking remote! Please. Do it now. No! Oh, no! Motherfucker! Oh! Shit. Oh, God. Oh, fuck! Thank you for coming down here so late. Somebody from the station said you needed some information... about a glass shipment? Yeah. A small case... no more than There's a glass tank on it... with a green button on the bottom of the tank? Yeah, yeah. I remember that. Costly job, as I recall. Had to special order the glass- Who ordered it? Here you go. Just like I thought. You got a name? Nah, nothing. We're gonna need to keep this receipt. Be my guest. If you can think of anything... that could help us find whoever ordered that case... please don't hesitate to call. We had a problem... with another order this guy made. We had to special order a drill... that he wanted mounted on a track of some kind. He called us a few weeks after that piece was due. He was mad as hell. Gave us an address to send the drill to. Said he was gonna finish the job himself. You have his address? Right here. Cherie. We're gonna get you out of there. Just sit tight, ok? We have to leave. No. Not without her. We'll go get help and come back! She's right. We can't do this on our own. We have to get the hell out of here! Cherie, do you hear me? We're gonna be right back, ok? I promise. I'm not gonna leave her. I'm not gonna leave. We have to. Go get help. Fuck. Oh, God. As long as I have my lighter on. As long as I have my lighter, I'm ok. Oh, my God. If I have my lighter, I'm ok. It's ok. As long as I have my lighter, it's ok. It's ok as long as I have my lighter. As long as I have my lighter, I'm ok. - Oh, my God. - It's a dead end. There's no way out. There's no way out. So what next? There's no way out! Oh, my God. Oh, shit! Run, little piggies. Ok... Get me out! Get this off me! Get this off me now! I'm gonna get you out. Get it off me. Hold still. Ok. Get me out now! Hold still. There's no way through. You promised you'd get me out of here. You promised! I will. Ok. I'll go- I'll get the window... you take the fire escape. Laura, you gotta work with me here. I can't! My hands. It burned my hands. We're trapped! We're trapped. Try, try, try again. Hold close along the stairs. Oh, God! There's no way out. - There has to be. - No. The show must go on. The game is far from over. It is for us! Yeah. We don't want to play anymore. We're leaving right now. As you wish. He's letting us go. Oh. Wait. Your exit. What if it's a trap? But what if it's not? Ok. You go first. No, you. Ok. Laura, listen, if I don't come back- No, don't say that! It's a way out. Right? Right. Right. I think it's gonna be ok. Brandon! Ok. Ok. Don't move. Get this off of me! All right. Ok. Ok. I'm gonna get these off of you now. Oh, my God. I'm not leaving him. I can't! Let me get these off of you. I have to get these off of you. Dylan! I know. You don't understand! I killed him! You didn't do anything wrong. You have to be strong right now so I can get you out of here. I killed a part of me! You will never understand how that feels! I know exactly how that feels. I'm gonna get you out of here. Come on. Let's go. Brandon! Oh, my God. Please! Help me! Jesus Christ! Please help! Hey. You can't do this! Hey. Let me out! I'm just scared, ok? Ok. You got me! I'm pissing my pants, all right? Now let me out! Oh, Christ. So... So, yeah, your shit sounds cool. I'm into being on TV, I guess. Turn it off. Oh, my name's Brandon. That's... Oh, wait... I'm 22 and I'm in between work and shit. That's not funny. I don't know. What else? I guess if I was-had to be afraid of one thing... I'd say it'd be the dark. I mean, I used to wet the bed a lot when I was a kid, but-oh, wait. You can't put that on TV, though. The fire exit downstairs will be open for one minute. Please... Come on. Thank you. There's a remote light switch at the bottom of the stairs. Ok. Oh, God. I can't. Oh, please. Oh, please, God. I can't. Don't do this. Please don't do this. No. Oh, God. Oh, please. Please don't do this. Please! No. Oh, God. Let there be light. Jesus fucking Christ! Better find that exit. I can't see. I can't see anything! You have the remote and 30 seconds. What the fuck is that? Oh, my God. Oh, shit! Conquer your fears, Brandon. Go towards the light before it's too late. My office will call the judge. We'll have a warrant in a couple of hours. You police? Yes, ma'am. You know the man that lives in here? He keeps to himself mostly. You know his name? Nope. Don't care to neither. Looks like bad news. Why do you say that? Well, all he does is sit there and watch TV all day and night. So loud, we have to call the manager sometimes. You should probably go back inside now. There's nothing to see out here. We know why he's not home. Let's get that warrant. Let's get that warrant. It's called breaking and entering... in case you didn't know. Home sweet home. Don't touch anything. A merciful death is better than a life of pain. You're gonna want to see this. Jesus Christ. Not quite. Make the call. Laura! Brandon! They're dead, aren't they? We're gonna get out of here. You either play the game, or you face the consequences. Your choice. So what's it to be? Are you ready to play? Are you? Any camera you see, go take it down. Game's over, you sick fuck. Where are you hiding? The show is cancelled! Kelly? Is that you? Cherie? Please don't kill me. Cherie! Cherie? Shit! God. Cherie! Get away from there! No! Oh, my God! That hurt. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Brandon. Don't touch anything, ok? Just keep breathing. I'm trying. Oh, God. I didn't know! Oh, God. Ah, the intrigue. The end fight. Cherie is already in the showdown. Now we're just trying to thin the herd. The game is still on. You're out of your mind. We're done with your sick game. Really? Is the game over, Laura? Help me! I'm dying here! Hi. I'm Laura... and I'm 20 years old. I work at a bank but I'm not gonna work there forever. It's just a first-rung thing, you know. I really think that I should- no. I want-actually, I need... to be on this show because I have a real phobia. I'm really afraid of germs... and I think-I mean, I really need to face my fears. One minute to inspire us all. Go find Laura. I can't! Just go do it. Where are you going? To find this bastard. Free those delicate little fingers, Laura... to call the police. Don't worry. They'll be able to trace this call. I can't! I can't do this! I can't! There are 12 pints of blood in the human body. You can lose 6 without consequence. After that, you risk all manner of complications. I know you have the guts to overcome your fear. Laura... Help! Help me! Help me! Laura, I'm gonna get you out of here. Laura! Cherie. Get out of there! Get out! Come on! Fucking dead! Leave me alone! Leave me alone. You want to call SWAT? I'm all out of favors. I'm the boy that cried wolf, remember? If he's in there- Look, the game's already started. You said so yourself. If he's in there, he'll be ready for us. We wait for backup, do this right. Oh, God. Thank God. Get out of the car. Come on. Come on, please... Come on... This is Special Agent Robison. Put me through to the ASAC's office. Sir, I'm at the old Harris Plant on 5th and Willow. Jay, wait! Sir, I'm gonna have to call you back. Don't! Detective. Somebody help me! Somebody help! Help! Police! Stay calm! I'm in here! Oh, thank God! It's all right. It's over. It's gonna be ok. Face your worst fear. I don't have one. Sure you do. You don't know how long I've worked on this little... reunion special. Please. One last game. God. Mom! For Christ's sakes, Kelly. Get out of here now. What is happening to us? We deserve this. What are you talking about? What we did to him. We deserve this. Ok. I never thought I'd do any stupid shows... but we need the money, and my name is Kelly. I just turned 21, and I live with my mom... in a crappy apartment. My dad is not on the scene. Am I scared? Every day. I'm scared someone will find out my secret. How did he find us? I don't know. Two years I've been searching. Two years I've been waiting. Two years I've been planning. Why did you bring the others here? They never did anything to you! I'm trying to teach you all a lesson. What fucking lesson? In order to get what you want, you have to suffer. Living with you, we suffered every single day! But you took your revenge, didn't you? How long did it take you to plan it? My whole life. A merciful death. Gasoline. You thought I fell asleep on the bed that night... didn't you? You thought I couldn't hear you as you went to the door... and lit your little fire. Please don't do this. I heard every single word you said to Kelly. Are you scared? And I told her, not in the fucking slightest. one for the door. Go to hell. I'm afraid that's where you're going... but there's always a chance that you'll survive like I did. Are you scared? This is punishment for what we did to him. He deserved this. I should've gone to the police. Mom. You did. Don't you remember? How many times can you get... a restraining order against a person? We deserve this. We tried to kill him. I'd kill him again in a heartbeat... and again and again! And again! Are you listening? Do you hear this? I would kill you in a heartbeat! For God's sake, Kelly. Get the key and get out of here! - Ok. - Go! Go. Go to hell! No! Play the fucking game! You're ruining my grand finale. Clever. Very clever. Now where's my daughter? Leave him! You can't do this to me. Not again. Kelly? Please. Hey, dad? I'm not scared anymore. Ok. Let's go this way. No. It'll never be over, Kelly. Not after what we did. How do we explain this? We don't have to explain anything. We're gonna keep on moving, just like we always do. Ok? Come on. The accident occurred shortly after midnight... and the entire freeway was closed down... while crews worked to clear the wreckage. And in other news... Hurry, Kelly. The train leaves in an hour. Just give me a minute. Police and firefighter investigations last night... when a fire broke out in the basement. The firefighters quickly controlled the blaze... but a gruesome discovery was made in the charred remains... of the building. There were 6 bodies found... All pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators... It can't be. Anything? Nothing. No signs of a body. Like a phoenix from the flames. Not exactly. Leads down to the sewer system. Where he belongs. Officials have confirmed fatalities... but it is still unclear if they were victims of the fire. Standing here in front of the fire station... I talked to investigators inside. They are entertaining the possibility of arson. Mom? There are two suspects that are being sought in connection... to this investigation... but they have not been named as of yet. This is Barbara Wintergreen for NB TV.
