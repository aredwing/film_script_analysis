VASUNDHARA, SARANYA, LlYASREE, DHANUSHlKA, MAHA VADlVELU How is the liquid storage service? lt's a green signal from the ground floor storage system. Compare the matching point to the weather. We are monitoring sir. - 1st stage report has come. - Give the file. Green revolution -1 - Have you seen the circular orbit? - l've seen. - How much watts is the solar panel? - 1000 watts. One minute. ls the liquid oxygen level correct? We are monitoring it. There should be a thrust of 27000 pounds. Only then, 1st stage take off could be possible. You need not worry about that. The take off has to be done when the weather is fine.. ..and reach the circular orbit. We will decide on the geostationary-circular orbit. lt is expected to get ready soon. - Please move a little. Greetings sir. - Greetings. - Has the count down started sir? - Will it be launched on the said date? Everything is ready. - We will start the count down soon. - What is the benefit of this satellite? Many satellites go around the space. But the satellite Green revolution -1 we launch now.. ..is a special satellite to help the natural agriculture. ln this world the food grains grow only in 2% of the land. That too lndia has the maximum output of the food grains. This is a long term plan! We will send satellites Green revolution 2 and 3 to space.. ..and utilise the very intricate science for the agriculture. That is our aim! There is a great contribution from the Tamil Nadu.. ..students in the creation of this satellite. lf there is a great part for the Tamil people.. ..in the space science, we could rule the space too! All lndia Radio, regional news. A tiger in the Mullimalai forest killed a pregnant woman.. ..and 2 boys, last month. lt killed 6 people including 2 foresters.. ..who tried to catch the tiger. There is a chance for the tiger to enter.. ..the village and kill people as it has known the taste of the humans. Mullimalai forest area is been cut off from other areas! Even the children are deprived of milk. Duruvan who is a tribe came to know the intensity of the situation. He went into the forest with intoxicated arrows to catch the tiger alive! lt is 3 days since he went to the forest. The tribes of the area are worried and waiting eagerly for Duruvan's arrival. The tiger has killed the mother. The child is crying for milk. As usual, someone breast feed the child. The jungle comes after killing the wild tiger! Adore him with a garland from every house. We are in this forest even before the God was born! We have won over the wild animals for our lives. We are blessed by the Mother nature! Forest water and wild honey are like our mother's milk! Mother! Goddess Parvathy! The jungle comes after killing the wild tiger! Adore him with a garland from every house. Play, and have joy of recreation! This forest is our dwelling. Hills are our pillars! Trees are our roofs. The earth is our God. The rivers here are divine! Fruits of the wild trees are our food! Pure air is our medicine. We lie in the mud without getting soiled. The smoke does not choke us! We have not put any fertilizer for the soil. As we are tribes, we're always energetic. The new generation of ours are not lost. We didn't deny the share to animals and birds either! Mother! Goddess Parvathy! The jungle comes after killing the wild tiger! Hill station is our land. Our house is our nest. The air and water are pure here. No outsider could step in this soil. We survive in this forest. Our strength is our input. This soil is as old as we are. The nature of the hill is similar to ours. The tea plants here grow on its own. We are on top here.. but without any growth. We have no communication with God. We have our hands as the investment. Mother! Goddess Parvathy! lt is very joyful to be in the hill station. - l want to tell a important matter now. - Tell it. There are 35 girls in the bus. Those 35 girls are not any good looking. Out of those 5 are dummy pieces. - Shut up! - l will.. About whom are you telling? But there is a pretty chick! - Who? - Do you know who? - Who? - Whom are you telling, captain? Our Victoria madam. Look mister! Don't tell anything wrong about our teacher! She will get upset if we tell elders as chick. Mr.Poornam! Don't act rigid. Let the students be little happy! - l will..! - Victoria.. The stick(kombu) is in your hand. My boy's name is Simbu! l have guts(thembu) in my mind. Don't show me your tricks(vambu). Don't anyone get down. Watch from here. - See there. A group of cannibals! - Stay here.. l will take a documentary film about them. l will be the director for that. - Esakki! - Tell me. - You hold the head. - Ok, brother. - You take it. - Move away. The calf has changed its position. That's why the cow could not lie down for 2 days. That's why Duruvan is called for. Otherwise, l would have managed the delivery. Hold the neck tight. Come this side. Or else, the cow will kick. - Don't disturb them. Come up. - Take care of it - ls there no censor for your film? - Oops! - Bring water for the cow. - Ok. Will you always dress like this? - She likes it this way always. - Don't talk. Do you eat human flesh being the cannibals? Don't talk like that you all go back to the bus. Sorry! Don't take it serious! - Never mind. - We've come here for NCC training. Do you know where the University hostel is? lf you go 6 kms from here there will be a check post! You have to go little beyond that. l don't feel like going from here. l wish to study in this college. Sit down you girls. This is an important camp. ..and sent to the forest for training. Those 5 only will participate in the Republic Day.. ..parade in Delhi! ls it ok? ls it the way to have training in the college? ..and you are playing your tricks on me. l am telling you.. l won't get scared by your gimmicks! l am a warden alright. But really l am a stern man! There are some rules and regulations in this college. Listen to those from me. You have to get up at 5 in the morning! You should take bath in just one bucket full of water. You have to cover up and sleep at nine. Look! He says that we can get up at 5 and go to sleep at 9. l told you that you can finish your training and go to bed at nine at night. He looks like a dark Raj Kapoor. He looks like Shammi Kapoor at top angle. ..and Sasi Kapoor at low angle. ..and Rishi Kapoor when looked from a side. When straightened he looks like Rajiv Kapoor! lf he bends down, he has the looks of Anil Kapoor. Will you bend a little? - What? - No..! Who do you think l am totally? We will smoke and drink beer at times. - Look at his arms! - Arms? We will go out at times. - You should not mind it. - Oh gosh! - What's happening here? - Madam, that is.. - What? - Madam.. He doesn't give the key to us and is torturing us by touching us. - ls he torturing you? - Yes madam! - He is dashing us madam. - What? - Yes! - Are you dashing them? - No! You look like a key seller with those keys in your hand. - Are you a thief? - No! - Do you get fits? - No.. Why do you need so many keys? Give me those. All of you can go and get ready. Shall we both sleep in the same bed? Why is that? This could be a NCC camp! But my rule is like the military rule. lt could be any wrong thing.. ..and whoever does it, l will ask her to.. ..run 10 times around the ground. We are the five pillars of the NCC camp. She tortures us daily by switching on this song! Ajitha! Switch it off. - My underwear is missing! - ls it a yellow one? - l saw her wearing that. - Catch her. - Stop. - Ajitha catch her. - Remove it! - No. To help the launching of the rocket.. ..our forest department wants to.. ..vacate the tribes of the forest in the South lndia. ..and to strengthen the defense. A circular has come saying that. l have put a special order allowing the girls to go into the forest. Madam! He is Duruvan.. a forest guard! He is the officer l've selected to take the cadets into the forest. We have met him already. No, sir. The girls have seen him in the morning.. ..while coming here among others. ls that why you are all laughing? He is a tribe and is selected as the trainer for us. We will know about lndia when we see him and his village. He has come up from the tribes.. ..who are illiterates. He has come here through the reservation quota.. ..by studying hard. They wouldn't get any food like us. l'm saying all this for you.. ..to gain self confidence! He has come as our trainer with shoes and uniform on! We should take him as our role model. Sir! Let him proceed. Let him do that. lf you've any complaints in the training period.. ..you can write a letter to us and put it in the complaint box.. ..kept in the college corridor. You can proceed now. lndia is our nation! lndia is our nation! Let us protect the people of lndia and virtues! Let us protect the people of lndia and virtues! Let us protect lndia by sacrificing our lives! Let us protect lndia by sacrificing our lives! For chewing gum in the parade l order senior officer Kalpana the punishment.. - Do 3 rounds of duck walk! - Sir! - 4 rounds. - Sir! - 5 rounds. l order sergeants Ajitha and Susheela Sergeant Susheela gets 4 rounds for refusing the punishment. Sergeant Thulasi gets 5 rounds for not putting the button in the uniform shirt. Cadet under officer Jenifar gets 5 rounds for wearing the name badge up side down. - He has punished the five pillars. - Move away! - Yes! - Take the plate. - Come in the line madam. Shut up you.. Do you know who l am? l'll take the eats for them! l'll take for my students. Sit. l am the trainer only in the ground. We shall be friends otherwise. The eats are good in the morning. Have it. Drat. When l see him.. He says the eats are good! - We have to put letter in the suggestion box. - What will you write in it? We don't need this trainer any more. Who knows Tamil well here? l've studied English since my Pre KG. - l don't know to read in Tamil. - Ajitha knows Tamil very well. She studied in Tamil medium till 10th class. You write. Duruvan is not eligible to be our trainer. How do you say that? What about his caste and ours? He shouldn't give us training. l know lndia's heredity and proud! We feel humiliated on the first day. All of us are affected. ..and he has come to train us. Duruvan has to go.. ..and appoint someone else in his place. Shall l put it inside? - Are you sure? - Yes, of course. lf l get a letter anymore,.. ..l can do whatever l like. You won't be able to wear a cap or uniform. You listen! Those from a place like this.. ..would behave like a savage. You be outside. Tell a coffee without sugar while you go. All be seated. Even officers like us can't help, if you want to know about the forest But it is very familiar for those. You have to cut off the wild trees till evening. That is your training today. We expected the training with the gun! lnstead you have given us the sickle. These are foreign seeds spread in the country spread without.. ..the knowledge of the inlanders. That will ruin our land and fields. lt is very difficult to destroy that. But they have to be destroyed. Are we here for NCC training or for agriculture, sowing the seeds? - You have sworn to save the nation. - Yes sir! This is an agriculture country. You can't make it into a super power.. ..without caring the agriculture and farmer. What are we supposed to do by knowing about the seeds? The unfertile hen lays unfertile egg. Same way if we sow unfertile seeds.. ..our land will become an unfertile land. lf our mother land become unfertile.. ..it is same like our mother becoming unfertile. We dump fake fertilizers in the fields, expecting more output. ..and by pouring the germicides, our fields.. ..have become barren! lf the fields become barren, it is same as we have become sick. Paddy is our national grain. lf it dies it equals my death. Cut the trees. Sir! Ajitha is been caught in the thorny bush. He is coming. Go fast. - Watch man Susai didn't see you, right? - Yes! Usually, you come to hostel room only. But today you've come to the class room. Why do we bother about the room? All the rooms are bed rooms for us. That day in the bathroom.. A man is inside without my knowledge! That Susai is stupid. Stupid Susai? Don't remove my dress. - ls he removing..? - Come! Damn you. Why the sound of a baby? You have begot a male baby instantly. ls he born so fast? They are telling like a parcel which has come through a courier service. You are talking like a male.. Aha! Mimicry! These girls do it nicely! They seem to be impudent. Politics and Economics. ln the past, the people exchanged goods.. ..which were necessary. That means.. They exchanged the salt for sugar.. Or they exchanged the chilly and got back the rice or grams whatever they want. This exchange was difficult.. ..so, the money has come in as the medium. They exchanged the goods for the money. When needed, they gave the money for the goods and got the goods. They have exchanged because of their necessity. But the role of money has changed. After that.. They have stocked the goods by exchanging the money for goods. When the demand was heavy.. ..they exchanged the goods for money and saved the money. lt was here, lots of money.. ..that is.. surplus money! lt started to dominate our society. From here everything started to move from the workers to the owners for ages. How is it possible? My father is a big business man. No workers could survive, if he doesn't invest the capital. Nothing could be changed without hard work. This table has changed because of hard work. This chalk piece was produced because of hard work. Only the wood would remain if the work is taken off from the table. lf you take of the work from the chalk piece, only the slaked lime remains. lf the work is taken off this building.. ..the bricks and the cement would remain. lf the work is taken off the bricks, only the mud remains. The whole world has changed because of hard work. But they didn't get anything those who have done the work.. ..by shedding blood, tears and sweat. How did the money move to those who have not done any work.. ..but live a luxurious life? Shouldn't we find it? We have to chop them off For that you have to study politics and economics. The experts in Economics searched for this only. After them, Carl Max only have found it and tell. Why must we know about Adam smith, Ricardo, Carl Max.. ..politics and economics? Teach us, that is necessary for NCC. Teach us that will help us to save our country. You can't save a country by just knowing about the guns and war tricks. Country belongs to the people who work hard. You can't save our nationality, language, culture, literature,.. ..without knowing politics and economics. Politics is not important to us. Talk about this in the stage. Don't talk this in the class room. Come! - Won't you all come? - He is right. We won't come. Yes! Please, listen to me! You.. l told you to teach the physical education. But you are giving them mental education. How much did you get in mathematics? - How about you? - 91, sir! - You..? - 89, sir! - How much did you get in science? - 73, sir! Sir, l got 86. Don't think that you can become a master to them. They didn't take you as a teacher. Greetings sir! l have brought you bananas and jackfruits from the forest. Weekly once, they used to bring everything. - See you, sir! - Get off. They are Duruvan's brothers and relatives. Do you want to eat banana? Take that shoe and give it to him. - Polish it and bring back. - Ok, sir! Go! Stay there and bring it. Change your uniform and go to ground. l will come with in 30 minutes. The mist is very thick. Oxygen has reduced. We have to run slowly. Come. Aim to the face level. The time was around seven. He snatched my eye lash and gone. l asked him to give back my eye lash. He gave back my eye lash. ..and went away with my eyes. l asked him to give back my eyes. He gave back my eyes! ..and went away with my heart. You cannot be without.. ..taking away something. l cannot be without ..losing something. Put the sand sack over there. This is human size target board. Target point is exactly pointing the human's heart. - No.8 rifle is mine. - Take the bullet box. You go and sit in the gallery. Don't anyone stand near the target board. How are you holding? When the bullet goes out, it will recoil. lf the rifle butt hits your shoulder, the bones could get fractured. Point it. Hold it with your shoulder. Hold well with your shoulder.. No, hold it tightly to your shoulder. Should l tell you separately? - Hold the rifle butt to your shoulder tightly. - ls it like this? - Yet, hold tightly. - Like this? Girls, did anyone see my pistol kept in the jeep? No, sir! - Did you..? - No, sir! - What Duruva..? - Yes, sir! - How are they shooting? - They are shooting well. - What are you searching? - He has lost his pistol and searching it. What, have you lost it? - ls it loaded? - Yes, sir! What man? You are telling as if you have lost the toys! lf anyone gets that, he could shoot 6 people. Why are you talking seriously? You are reacting seriously. He will search it. Where will it go? You don't know madam. He is the in charge for Already, no pistol is given to any officer in the forest department. l have recommended personally, signed in that and gave the pistol to him. You all were here only. Did you see that? l didn't see that, madam. You..? Oh gosh! l didn't see. lt wouldn't have gone anywhere. l will go and search in my house. Four or five girls go with him to help. l will give you two days time. lf you don't get back the pistol, l will suspend you. After that, if you didn't get it.. ..you will be dismissed on charge that you've sold it to the terrorists. l think, he has bought the books with his entire salary. Sir, is it good to read? Ajitha wants to read this. Vennira lravugal(White color night) Dostoyevsky has written this. lt is a love story which made the world very emotional. Sir, we are youngsters. Don't you have any book which will make us excited? Why not? Look in the third shelf. Life history of Jhansi Rani! lt will be very emotional. l have a doubt. - Really, do you have a pistol? - Susheela! Keep quiet! lt's getting late. You can go. l will search it. Don't give back the pistol. We will get in trouble. Why do you have to be punished for my mistake? First thing tomorrow l will surrender it to Ganapathi Ram sir.. ..and apologise to him at the parade. Tomorrow morning, Ajitha will give the pistol to the ranger. Before that.. We have to tell about Duruvan to Victoria madam.. ..that he was trying to misbehave with us. For that, one in 4 of us will go in nude. - Food.. - l am ready to go nude. Nude? Tonight at twelve, l'll go around the college in nude. Nude means, even without the underwear. lt is not such a big matter for me. So many times, l have won in this kind of betting. Like that, l will walk till the morning. Without a dress in the body..? They are behaving very steamy.. What shall l do? At night at 12, Victoria madam will go for rounds. You have to call Duruvan at that time. Then, call Duruvan. Sir, l am Kalpana speaking. Tell me Kalpana! Why at this time? l only took your pistol which was missing. Where are you now? l will come soon. Don't come here. My friends shouldn't know about this. lf Victoria madam knows about this, she will dismiss me from the college. So, today night at 12.. ..come to the hostel after they all go to sleep. Ok, l will come. Oh gosh! l have to be awake at 12 o'clock. lf l sleep before that..? l shouldn't sleep.. l am telling you not to sleep.. Don't sleep.. l am hitting myself because l do not sleep.. where is it? Don't sleep! lf you sleep, l will pluck out your eyes. Stay awake! Come! What is the sound? He is going this side. Madam is coming that side. lt is the right time to put him into trouble. We have to cover her when madam is going to see her. Give it! - What's happening here? - No, madam that is.. Duruvan only asked me to come in nude at night 12 o'clock. Then only he'll take us for trekking. Are you playing? You are all girls, isn't it? Go to your room. You.. l think l will lose my dignity because of you. Last night you have tried to misbehave with Jenifar.. ..by entering into the hostel. Now, her brothers have come here. They are very angry. How can l face them? They felt scared to inform you that the pistol is here only. That's why they have called me and informed that. Who have called you? Kalpana only. Oh gosh! l didn't call him. Kalpana, tell me the truth. - l swear on Jesus. l didn't call him. - Oh gosh! - What? - Why are you hitting me while l am talking..? What to talk with you? - You damn it! - You are after all a shepherd, isn't it? - Please listen to me. - Who have selected you as a trainer? Please listen to me. - l didn't do any mistake. - Why should to listen to you? - l am telling the truth. - Don't be hasty. - Please listen to me. - Sir, go! Why are you watching that? - Tell them! - Sir, move aside. - l will take care - Move away, sir! Come Duruva! You go! You go that side. - Wait! - Sir, just a minute please listen to me. - Susheela leave me. - Leave me. - Don't beat him. - Leave me! - Sir, leave him. l am telling you to leave him. - Tell them about me. - Come this side. - You keep quiet and ask pardon..! - l only took that pistol.. - Lift her. - Sir..! - Shut your mouth. - Leave me. lf you give the pistol, we will get the trouble. Are you romancing? Listen to us! Else we will draw your image with him.. ..and write vulgarly. She won't tell anything and put us into trouble. Compromise, isn't it? What are you doing? How dare you to enter our campus and hit our officer? Tell madam. What punishment should l give to Duruvan? Still, what is there to punish him? lf there is a big issue like this.. Our old coach.. ..will punish us to clean the toilet for a day. No, madam. She is telling correctly. You have to be an example for the students by accepting your punishment. Hey, take your sister with you. Should l tell you in person? Go man. Why are you looking? Go girls. Go! Why did you upset his mind giving a punishment like this? Don't worry madam. He won't get upset for this. - Greetings brother! How are you? - My relatives. - l am fine! How are you? - l am fine Susai. We have to see Duruvan's teaching. That is our long time wish. Yea, dear! We came here to hide and see. Why should you hide and see him? Sit in a chair and look him directly like watching a movie. All off you come. Duruva.. What is this? Why are you cleaning the toilet? Ranger only has asked him to clean the toilet as punishment. Keep quiet! Why should he clean? We will clean it. Did we come for that? What punishment? Stop it! Should a cobbler's son do only a cobbler's job? Or launderer's son be a launderer? And barber's son be a barber only? Shouldn't a man from a backward class become a officer? l am asking you.. Did you come to learn from him or to teach something to him? ls it happening without my knowledge? For me, the bathroom is also like a class room. Yet, why are you standing here? You want to see him by hiding. Did you see that? Try to save your children by giving things to them.. ..instead of giving to others. Come let's go! Come! What will be the labour charge, if you pluck one sack of tea leaves? What is the price for 1kg of tea powder? - Students, you have to go to sleep after finishing this, ok? - Yes, brother! Ajitha, how did you come here? - Walking. - Walk? lt is 6 km distance! ..at this night? Are you a fool? You are educated. Ok, tell me. l only took your pistol. Come! l wanted to give back that to you right then. But, they.. We shouldn't blame others for our mistake. l want to tell lot of things to you.. ..and ask many things. The steps are slippery. Watch out. Sit! l feel to be here with you. Of course. But you can't stay with us. Madam, don't mistake. - Ajitha took my pistol just for fun. - You.. Madam, she has realised her mistake. Hence, don't punish her. Not only this mistake.. She is the reason for everything who called you.. ..to come to the hostel at night and created a lot of problems. She is only the reason too everything. Oh gosh! l didn't do that madam. Kalpana only called him. Look Kalpana.. Already l have suspected you.. Tell me the truth. You have called him, isn't it? - Yes, madam. - Seek pardon from him. You girls should ask apology from him by putting kneel down. - No need madam. - Sorry! Madam tell them. l have selected these five girls to take to the forest. Shall l help you to choose another five girls instead of these five? What madam? Why are you talking like this? This five girls didn't cooperate properly among the 35 girls.. ..those who have come here. They only need lot of training. l will take them. Madam, read that list. Forest officer Duruvan will tell you.. ..what to take with those who are going to the forest. Everyone take one bed sheet, trekking shoes,.. ..and take a jerkin to keep away from the cold. Lot of leeches will be there because of rain. So, everyone bring a snuff box with you. Sir, chilly powder? Then take 2 match box, 4 candles, a bottle of oil, and 1 packet salt, everything.. What is he going to do taking us to the forest? He is going to prepare the pickle.. This NCC camp is going to finish from today. What..? Nothing, you have to write a letter in Tamil. To whom? To our ranger Ganapathi Ram. We are not interested to go to the forest with Duruvan. Duruvan has compelled us and taking us with him. - Will it not create any problem..? - Just for fun. Then only they won't forget us for years. There is some motive in this. ln this trekking, if anything happens to our life.. ..or anything happens to our virginity.. What is meant by virginity? Duruvan only will be responsible for those. No, l won't write this. Else, we will write worse than this in English.. That is more dangerous.. So, write it! ln case if we don't come back alive.. Yours.. Girls who are going to be affected with tears.. All of you sign in this. Give it. Get the sign from Ajitha. Listen carefully. This is the plan. lt will be problem if we do not reach before evening. But we shouldn't come back. Then why we are going there? He should not take any girl for training any more. He should feel that we are a burden for him. Damn it. Why you need tape recorder? We are not going for training. We are going to the picnic only. - Put the signature in it. - Ok sir. ln this forest trip with 5 girls.. ..l am responsible for whatever that happens to these girls. - Ok sir! - Put the witness signature in it. - With pleasure. Who else can l believe other than Duruvan in girls' matter? - As per lB report lndian government's order. - Put the rifle backside.. We've sent out even the people collect dry twig. Despite that l am sending you into the forest. - You have to back at 6 o'clock. - Ok sir. What sir? Vehicle groans. Change the gear. Kalpana, you don't change that. - Greetings sir - Greetings brother. l will put the entry in check post and come. We also put the entry in petty shop. l want chips. Give one condom. Condom? Why you need that? We need in the forest. - l want one. - l will take one. l didn't get a chance like this in my service. But you have got it. Each and every girl is like a laddu(sweet)! Quick. Do you know driving? Sir, we are going. Girls, stop the vehicle. - Go fast. - Girls! Stop the vehicle. Thulasi, stop the vehicle. You have made us to run in the ground. lsn't it? Now you run. - Apply the brake. - Sir, Don't be afraid. - Steering is not in our control. Don't be scared. Change the steering to the left and be steady. - Apply the brake. - Don't do. Vehicle will topple. - Push the clutch. And change the gear. - l feel scared.. - Give the steering to me. All jump one by one. - Switch off the engine. Don't off the engine. lt won't help. Now apply the brake. - Susheela, open the door. - l can't open the door. - Vehicle has stopped. No need to worry. - Open the door! - Don't anyone move. - Oh gosh l feel scared. Don't be hasty and be patient. - Take all the things before the jeep falls. - Get down fast. - Come. - Take the torch. - Come this side. - Come fast. - Leave the vehicle and stand away. - Take it fast. - Take it fast. - Give that bag. - Susheela, take this. - Take the rifle. All hold the rifle. - Sir, my hand is stuck. - Don't be scared. Please, pull me. We can't go up easily. We must go around the three mountains. We will reach the check post before evening.. ..if we walk without any rest. Thulasi, there is no signal in the cell phone, They'll cut the signal in reserve forest. No human has gone in the way we are going. - This is Cheetah's foot print. - Oh God! Just now it has drunk water and gone. lt could be somewhere near. You have to follow the foot print if anyone miss in the forest. But bear's foot print will look like human foot print. Be careful. Come, we will see where the cheetah is. Jenifar, don't go that side. Listen to me. Come back. We have to go before it is dark. This is the super place for Susheela's birthday party. Girl with gun! You are hot, darling! The world is born for you! Whose is tomorrow's world? We shall live for ourselves today. Ask the wind to stop. Ask the river too to stop. Ask only the cuckoo to sing. Happy birthday! Girl with gun! You are hot, darling! The world is born for you! Whose is tomorrow's world? We shall live for ourselves today. The heart tunes up the song! Youth is enthusiastic! Let's enjoy! Not Kuchipudi dance alone.. ..learn Kungfu fight too. Not only to wear the dress. Try to learn to rule. You are not a drop but the sea! Think that and fight. Girl with gun! You are hot, darling! The world is born for you! Whose is tomorrow's world? We shall live for ourselves today. Ask the wind to stop. Ask the river too to stop. Ask only the cuckoo to sing. Happy birthday! Susheela, don't go there. Listen to me. Sir, don't do anything. There are so many leeches and poisonous insects. You will lose your life if one of it bites you. Don't be here for a minute. Change the dress and come fast. Hey, has he seen you in fully nude? We have to walk fast. Then only we are safe. Come fast. Aren't you the tribe, who knows about the forest well? Show the hemp plant. Whatever he sees, he'll bend before it. Sir is going to tell the story. This is not a small matter as you think. This is elephant's dung. That too of a lone tusker. lt is not dangerous if it is a herd of elephants. lt is dangerous if it is all alone. - That too it is somewhere near us. - How do you tell this? Dung is hot. Just now it has put this dung. - Ajitha, take the fire stick. - l like elephants. - Susheela, will you come with me? - l won't come. - l will go. - Come let's we go this side. Kalpana, stop. - Where is the elephant? - l don't know. Don't get scared. We can't go to the college today even if we walk fast. Because it is very late. We have to stay in the forest. But it is dangerous to stay in dense forest. Soon we have to go to a plain. First we have to ready the stick to build the tent. Come, it is getting late. What a beautiful place! Hey, cashew nut. We will go and see from the rock. See, we are hearing our echoes. Sun shine will remain for After that snow will spread out in all places. You won't see the person near you. This is the fourth day of finishing full moon! So the moon will be coming late. We will get only star's brightness. No one shouldn't come out of tent without my permission. - Do you know the basic to build the tent? - We know that. Hey, don't pinch me. You put the fire as you feel cold. Then what about us? Sir, Ajitha wants to talk a matter to you. Sir, we didn't see a snake in the forest. You have told that no one has come to this forest. You said that we only have come here. l saw two persons in the forest. They are not our people. They are foreigners. They are whites. Hey, don't create any problems. Tell me. How did they look like? They were in military getup, with machine guns, and walky-talky. Which side they came and in which side they went? They came by the north side where you were chasing the elephant. And they went towards west. Bring the map. This is the new map taken from the satellite of this forest. Look! This is snow valley. Now we are here. Kalpana saw the 2 foreigners here. Why do foreigners come lurking into our forest? Plans which can't be imagined are going on in this world aimed at our lndian market. What is the connection with that to the foreigners? Tomorrow evening lndia will launch the rocket from Vellimalai. Their aim will likely be to destroy that. How can we tell that so correct? As Kalpana said if they went this way.. ..they'd reach the north side of Thoongum lake within 5 hours to cross 14th forest. There is a short cut which l only know. lf we go through hill valley from the Snow valley, we reach Mutheri. From there Kalladu malai... lf we cross Vettu parai we can reach We can see well from here how they come out of the forest. lf they come there, their aim will only be to destroy the rocket launch. Remove the tent. Tomorrow is the rocket launch. Two people are now in the forest with latest weapons. That too foreigners..! There aim is to stop the rocket launch. We will disperse from here. l will go alone to the forest. lf you go 8 kms west from here you will see a narrow path. lf you climb on the mountain you will see a mountain way. You get into the vehicle on the way and go to our hostel. And tell to the Ranger Ganapathi to pass the information to security force. l will somehow kill one guy. l have to catch the other one alive. Share and eat the biscuits and breads in the bag. You won't get water on the way. So use water with care. Don't worry about me. We can't keep quiet when the danger is before us. - We won't part you. - We all will come with you. lt is a tough journey. Do you send us as women are not fit enough? Women have a great power. lt should not be wasted unnecessarily. We will save the country by sacrificing our life. We will destroy the foreigner's power entirely. We will protect the lndian people and virtues. lf anyone of you gets lost in the forest you break a branch on the way. lt is the mark that we are going in this side. Broken branch will show the way we went. Whole college would wonder as we didn't reach the college yet. Somehow they will come in search for us. Jenifar, remove your shirt. Tie the shirt in this stick like a flying flag. lt will toss in the wind as your shirt is very soft. lt could be seen from a distance. This is the sign for those who come searching for us. This is the sign when we come back too. Don't be scared. This lake have water only up to our hip level. Come with the help of the stick. - What happened? - What happened? - My leg is caught. - Hold her hand. Don't be scared. - Wait. Leave the shoe. - Pull her, come. Come with the help of the stick. You will know if there is any quicksand. - Afterwards you step your leg. - Go. Give that stick. Go to the front. We have only little distance from here. The mud is more in the shore. Come carefully. Careful. Keep the stick there. lt will be useful when we come back. Come slowly. They are bats. Generally they come out only in dark. But they are flying in the day after hearing us coming. You can't walk without shoes in the forest. That's why this arrangement. We have a long way to go. This is Thoongum lake which we saw in the map. This is Megamalai where we stand. That is 14th forest which you are seeing as the dense forest. The foreigners Kalpana saw should come the forest way to Thoongum lake. As per my calculation they will come in an hour. We'll think later how we've to kill one, and how to catch the other alive. You look tired. Go and have food. Spread it quickly l feel hungry. See, she is very eager to eat. - Give it to me. - l have only one. - Give it to me. We didn't imagine that we could be here like this. - Me too. - l wouldn't forget this day till my death. l too won't forget even l die. How can you remember this if you die? Sir, give it to us. We will watch. You go and eat. Ok, you keep watching. l will go and clean the rifle. - Did you see anything? - Nobody is there. l have belief in her watching. But l have no hope that the two would come this way in this big forest. ls it true that you saw two guys? l swear that it is true. Give it to me. The people who Kalpana saw are coming there. Birds are flying, after seeing people. See if they are the ones whom you saw. Yes sir. Birds are still flying. l think, more people are there in the forest. Many people are coming. There are 16 people We thought that they are only two guys. But they are 16 guys. They have two big boxes with them. Why they have come to the forest? Tomorrow lndia launches the rocket from Velli malai. lf lndian rocket sour high, lndia will reach the first place in space research. They are coming to stop the rocket launch. Which country they belong to? They don't have any country's feelings. This is a international mercenary force They are mercenary force of the owners who lose by the rocket launch. lt is happening before us. What can we do? We have to stop that. We can't stop by fighting them. They are 16 people with latest weapons. But we are only 6 people and only have pistol and rifle. Take the map. As per my calculation they are coming to this lake way.. ..and cross the river and they will reach Tamil malai through Bamboo forest. Because they could aim correctly from Tamil malai.. ..to destroy the rocket launch from Velli malai. Now they are here This is the way they would go. Here it is less deep. So they would cross the river here. From there it is Bamboo forest. Tamil malai from the Bamboo forest. Rocket launch is here So their plan would be between here to here. We have to go to other shore by crossing the waterfall.. ..and stop them and delay them. That is what we can do now. This is the way to go. Thalaiyaruvi and from there it is Paneerkadu. We have to stop them from crossing the river here. That too we can do only till this evening. What is the next move? We have no other way. One of you should go to college and tell the Ranger.. ..to send the security force before this evening. This is the first plan. lf one of you go from here to Vettuparai.. ..to cross Mutheri. lt will take 4 hours to reach Panipalam. You will reach the college in an hour as l told you is the shortcut. if they get the information before 4 o'clock. We will get security force at 5 o'clock.. You have to decide who is going to take up the difficult trip. - l will go. - No, l will go. Kalpana, you are the senior under officer. You know well about your team. - Decide yourself. - Ajitha can go. Already she has experience in forest trekking. As a Pole vault champion, she can cross Vettuparai and Mutheri easily. That's why l selected Ajitha. There is no time left. Make her ready fast. Cross the Vettuparai carefully. Be careful. Hair shouldn't be let loose when you go to the forest. Village girls spent their whole time adjusting half saris. City girls spent their whole time adjusting the hair. You liked my pistol, isn't it? ln the forest it will be useful for your safety. Be careful. Without knowing his value.. ..we wrote bad about him and put it into the suggestion box. Before Ranger looks at it, take it and tear it when you get there. This is the place we meet wherever we get separated. Because no one can come to this place easily. These 16 people are very dangerous who have come through the forest way.. ..than the 10 who have come to Mumbai via the sea. What can just 16 people do? Foreigners came to lndia to do business. Only 10,000 people ruled lf we had been united we could've driven them away so easily. We have to keep an eye on the strangers whoever it is. We have to decide on a signal, when we get separated. Sir, l can shout like a dog. There is no dog in this forest. Sir, l can shout like a duck. lt is very easy to shout like a cuckoo! This is ok. You too shout, sir. This is the only place to cross this river. Because it is less deep here. lf they miss this they will have to go around for 16 km. They should not cross this river. We have to cut as many trees to block their entry. We should cut the trees when they watch us doing it We have to show that we are many in the forest. Ok? This is a recess tree. Even 10 people can hide in this tree. This is the correct place to hide and save our belongings. Come on. They are coming. All of you be ready. lt has worked out that we have cut the trees. They have gone some other way. We shouldn't under estimate them. We will have to hide. You have to watch the opposite shore for each and every moment. We are not interested to go to forest with Duruvan. He could prove to be dangerous. ln this journey, if we die or lose our virginity. ..Duruvan is responsible. - What is this? Our children have gone after writing a letter. But you are taking it so easy. - Who is he? - He is Kalpana's father and a History professor. Already we have beaten him for his misbehavior. You have sent our girl with that rogue. Sir, he is not like that. Our friends would have done out of mischief. See, they are children not only to you. Every girl is my girl too. Nothing would happen as written in this letter. Why should we argue whether he is good or bad? First you search them in the forest. They are Ajitha's parents. He is a tailor. Give a complaint to me signed by all, saying you have no belief in Duruvan.. ..as you have read the letter, and to find our girl. l will go to the forest with my team. You forward this letter to police department & collector office. You give this Xerox to media, reporters & internet. - Two people have come. - l can see it clearly. Even a leaf shouldn't move. They are not going in some other way. They've selected only this way. They have sent them as spies to know all about us. What should we do now? This is the correct place to attack them. We will leave the one who comes first. Our target is second person. lf we attack the first person the second one will become alert. We have to finish the attack before the first one returns back. Because there is no way that side. He should come back this way only. Divide into two teams between you four. l will climb on the tree and put the rope down. You take that rope and one team go to east side. And other team go to west side. lmportant thing. You have to hide and heed my signal too. Don't panic. Patience is very important. Pull. Sit down. They shouldn't know that they are dead. That's why l killed without any sound. l did before you for you to see this. You need this training too. He is not a human or an animal who is dead. He is more dangerous than those. Foreigners will win if we die. lf they win lndia will lose. First l stabbed at his neck so that he wouldn't speak. l stabbed in his heart so that he wouldn't run away. l stabbed in his abdomen to kill him. You have to learn to kill by seeing and doing it. Otherwise we would be killed. Put the two corpses in one place. Take the weapons. Find out if there is any other evidence. Backward people's participation in freedom fight. - We'll offer us for this forest and country - Pray to the bow. Hey, stop it. Where is Duruvan? He has gone with five girls and still he didn't come. Search in every hut. Within five minutes all of you vacate this place. Did you sell this forest to real estate people? l will arrest you that you've smuggled sandal wood.. ..even if you go to collect dry twig. Search all the huts leaving none We don't know what problem he has in the forest. Why don't you search him in the forest instead of here? According to law you shouldn't be here. Do you know that? Animals only have to be here. We are working for 2000 years in this forest. Where will we go if you ask us to go? Why are you speaking arrogantly? Don't stamp the rice. Damn the rice! This is not a town. A temple and marriage here and worshiping a stone as God. l won't leave you. Kill that dog. Break everything. Go. Destroy everything. - Why do you need to study? - Oh God! Lift the slate. They will break this. We get beaten if we don't study. But they are hitting for studying. How dare you to hit me? So many books are here. He is studying science too. Books for forest tribe! They are studying the books without going to school. lf you study in the convent you will drive us away. Burn off all the books. Go. Go away. Forest people! Will you rent this place to the foreigners after driving us away? We make you study in government money. But you are talking politics against government. Do you know now about the government, rule and power? Are you trying to rule over us? This world will see the working peoples' dictatorship.. Separate the weapons, water, food and medicine. Even the cotton is useful to us. We should fight them with their weapons. They have sent 2 people. They didn't expect that we would kill them. lsn't it? They thought that we lndians follow Mahatma Gandhi's non-violence. They didn't think that his grand kids would become like Bhagath singh. You are doing murder causally. But you didn't react when my friends and brothers hit you. We have to use the power only against the enemy. This is M16. We can shoot up to 3,200 feet. We can aim and shoot up to 550 meter. lf needed we can remove the handle and fix. This is M82 rifle. We can aim up to 1,850 meter target. lt will destroy even the military vehicle. We have only two rifles. You decide whom do you want to give it. We can give to both of them. Blood is there in bread. We should not waste anything. What is this weapon? Land mine. They've planned clearly and brought the land mine. Three people are coming. Only two machine guns have for five of us. They are coming to give us three more guns. l think that the plan to kill them is wrong. l feel also right what she says. Why don't you tell him? Ok. Both of you go to this side. You come with me. We won't be able to kill them as we killed two people before. Because they will be very alert. l have another plan. But Duruvan has some other plan. They look like they are intelligent. Shall we change the plan? No. We will do what he told us. Ok. We will hide behind of this tree. lf they come l will shoot them first. Ok. Careful. Go you damn! Don't calculate wrongly. Go you damn! Ok, you have come after hearing the music sound. lt will be useful if someone gets lost in the forest. Enemies also know this. Be careful. One person has escaped. They might know about us and our strength. So the rest 12 people will plan to kill us and go forward. We can't stop them from crossing the river. Our plan is to hold them. We have only one way. That is the Bamboo forest in the middle. We should not allow them to cross that. lf they cross the Bamboo forest we will fail. This is an alien forest to them. They will step with fear. That is the strength for us. Lift the dead bodies. Take the machine gun. Tamil mother will bring up courage in the child.. ..which is in her womb. Wear this dress. We will hide and attack them now on. This camouflage dress is safety for you. What about you then? Someone will come for that. l took everything which were in the bag. We don't have water and food. Falls is there for water. Ganapathi Ram will come before evening with all things if Ajitha has told him. - How many land mines are there? - 8 land mines are there. Take all of that. Sir! They've brought the bow and arrow. We may need that. Keep it. Sir, look here. Some important document is here. This is what he had brought in the box. l have studied about this. lt has been there for aeronautics. This is SAM type missile. This is surface to air. lsn't it? l have studied in information technology. This is GPS. lt is functioning from Global positioning system. This system is like flying fight. GPS tracking system controls where it has go and fire. Read about the functioning. First we put the dead body in Bamboo forest. This is the way they would come. Hide the land mines in all places. They shouldn't cross this Bamboo forest. This is M14 land mine. lt will be ready to fire if we remove the U clamp and turn button S to A. Turn it from the safe and keep it in the armed position. Like this. My principle is any land mine shouldn't be hidden in this world. But this struggle is against the enemy. We are hiding it in our own country to hold them. Hide the land mines everywhere in the Bamboo forest. Everyone should know the mark where it is buried. After finishing the struggle, we've to take all land mines which has not fired. Sir, we have two more land mines. - Don't bury that. - Why sir? They would search for all the mines. Let them keep on searching. l know all the routes in this forest. This forest looks like green leaves for me. Bring the ledger which was signed by Duruvan. l allowed him because he gave your letter. Whatever l asked he was staring on me. Hey, why have you pointing him out? That girls didn't like to go with him. She started the vehicle. he got in himself. Sir, they bought condoms also. Don't you have tea shop? Now are you doing this business? - Hey, what? - l was talking just for fun. Why do you want so many black cats? Just now he has told this forest is like green leaves for him. Not that sir. Lift him and put into the vehicle. He'll be useful. Sir, don't listen to him. lnform me if you come to know about Duruvan or any information about him. Understand? Tomorrow is the rocket launch. No one shouldn't cross the check post. Be careful. Ok sir. We will take care. Why are you lifting me like green leaves? - Beat him and make him get in. - Wait. Sir, a bra is here. You got only a bra. Why are you telling as if a dead body? What sir? Duruvan might've raped a girl and killed her. Again and again you are blaming him! You are talking too much. Come. What do you tell about the 5 girls who were gone to the forest? Go back. Five girls who had gone into the forest hasn't returned. Sir, come here. l have found out. - Come fast - What? Look there, the shirt is hanging in the stick which is the missing girls. Definitely Duruvan had gone this way only. Go and see what cloth is that? What is floating there? Go and see there. You said that there is no route in satellite map of this. Now what do you say? We have eaten the fruits and threw the seeds. Oh God! Will anybody eat with the seed? All will throw the seeds after eating the fruits. Ok, come we will do the duty. - Sir, l got a bag! - Sir, l got a shoe! Shoe? Find out if there is anything else. Sir, we got a girl's dead body. Lift her up. This is Duruvan's pistol. This is an important evidence. Careful. Nothing wouldn't have happened what you fear. - Tell me. - We got a girl's dead body. Have you found out which girl? She is one of the girls who went for trekking. She was wearing orange color pants. She is wearing orange color T-shirt with lines. That is Ajitha's dress. Now what l have to do? This matter has become a national issue. You are on the spot. You have to decide what you have to do. He is a psycho who rapes the girls and kill them. Because we got the undergarment of a girl with blood. And we got another girl's shoe. A body of a girl is before me who was raped by him. Even God wouldn't bear this. - There is no so called rape in our caste. - Shut up. l have to move next step only if you give the order to shoot and get him dead. Don't give the wrong order without any enquiry. Another 4 girls are there. Duruvan is only there if anything happens to other 4 girls. l have to move next step if give the order to shoot him. Shoot him to save those 4 girls. Sir, don't shoot him. Don't shoot a good person in a hurry. Handover the body to the Collector. ln a short while, it will be dark. We can't expect the help of security force. Ajitha would have got lost. Why? The security force would also have got lost. Tomorrow is the rocket launch. They would search the land mine only till tonight. Whatever it is tomorrow they will go to Tamil malai. Before that we have to get at least one box. Eat well. We will have no time to eat. There is an 8 minute gap between 2 beats! The box is without security for 8 minutes. Time is early morning 3 o'clock. The rest 5 persons are sleeping well as there is security for them. This is the correct time to attack. We can stop the missile launch if we take at least one box. ln 4 minutes l will kill the guys coming towards me. Susheela and you hide a few distance from the box. First person has 2 minutes. After finishing him, Jenifar, you go and guard there like him. lt will be 2 minutes to kill the second one too. After killing 2nd person you and Jenifar will go there in 1 minute. ln the rest 3 minutes we can come to a safe place taking the box. Wait there. Our count will start when they separate. - Do you have any more doubts? - No sir. This dress is nice for you. Our plan got missed. They have the box with the missile. So they will launch the missile. lt is time to launch the Rocket. Either, they will go forward destroying us. Else we will have to attack them to go forward. Finally it will come to an end after a furious fight. You are educated. You know the basics of using the latest weapons. So these weapons are nothing new to you. Take that. This is the rocket launcher's war head. This is a mini gun. lt will shoot 3000 bullets in a minute. This is grenade launcher. This has the mechanism of a revolver. This is stinger. You have to take the position with one step back. This is a mini gun bullet belt. - l have to seek you pardon. - Why? We didn't like your training and complained wrongly that.. ..we made you to come to college and saw in nude. My natives ask me to conduct our girl's first delivery. ln my point of view nude is something different. We've mistaken your knowledge as you have studied in reservation quota. There is no teacher to give the marks for you. We feel proud to be your students. Pardon us. ls this the time to ask pardon? War would be deadly! Probably death would happen. lf you need, attack them alone or together. Don't panic at any time. Shoot continuously. Go forward by shooting. World is seeing the Tamilian's bravery. You can also prove that. We can't face them in Bamboo forest. l will take them to Masanakadu by changing their way. Kalpana, you have to be the head of the team if l die. You read the international politics whatever you learn and read. Nothing is there other than socialism. - Where is Susheela? - We don't know. Don't cry. lf we will be alive we will cry after finishing the struggle. We have danger around us every moment. You have to kill at least one person to pay the respect to Susheela. You only have all the powers. You are the goddess Kaali! You are Durgai! You are Parasakthi! We would need the knives. Secure them. We will bury Susheela's body here and mark it. - Take it. Wear this. - No. l don't want. You may need it. Wear this. Shall l finish them as the forest celebrate and land goes high? ..and the seven seas clap hands! The sky turns wild, the dark clouds creates thunder. The storm strikes fast. Shall l slash the heads? Let us kill the enemies. Let us finish our work by taking the lives. He sends the God of death's arrows. Who can stop the thunder strike? When the tiger community advances.. ..the mouse community is in danger. The women are ready to fight. What will happen to the enemies? Break the barrier! Make the steps to enter. Finish the fight. Set fire to the anger! A song in the jungle! Complete your mission! Lullaby in the death! Proud.. proud.. proud, which is old! Bravery.. bravery.. bravery, which is new. Life is not important when the dignity is at stake. - Everyone go in each direction. - Ok sir. Wherever you see Duruvan, shoot him like a dog. Go. We have no time for this. We have only half an hour for rocket launch. Before that we have to go to Tamil malai. Be patient. You have to be well so that we could go there. Kalpana, listen to me. Hey, don't shoot him. Sir, he said that we are slave dog. Take the walky-talky. This is a very poisonous herb. lf you cut the hand in this wipe knife it will be danger for your life. Treat all 6 knives like this. We have killed 14 people in 16. Balance two people. Chief will come searching for me. Another one is near the missile. Before he starts the missile you kill him and get the missile. You run as fast as you can. Ok? Sir, you speak English very well. But you never spoke to us. Our people won't understand English if l speak to them. You don't like it if l speak in English to you. Sir, don't shoot. lt is me.. Thank God. You've come. l was expecting you. l am also searching for you. Where are those girls? You have proved that you are a tribe. Don't you know anything except this? - Our country is in danger. - Are you telling story to me? Surrender to me. - Did you get Duruvan? - Problem is more serious than we expected. - Our country is in danger. - What are you saying? Terrorists have entered our forest as happened in Mumbai. - All are foreigners. - Shall l send force for your help? No sir. My team is enough. l will kill all of them and handover the dead bodies to you. Shall l shoot him? - l will shoot him. - lf you miss, it will hit the missile. First missile number U233SN48261 and feed it to 9. lt is asking for the altitude. - Ok, l will go and see there. - l will go and see the radar. - ls it ok? - Left. - We will open and see it. - No. lt will be danger if we open this. We will try one more time. lt is wrong. Missile is lifting up. Press the down arrow in navigation key. Press yes. - Press down arrow. - Wait. Adjust the radar. - ls it ok? - Little more. We've to stop the missile somehow. Press stop. lt has not stopped. We have tried all the methods. lt is asking for the password. We have tried mechanical and manual. But both didn't work. Missile is on, even if we switch off the system. This is new version of Ram jet engine. We can't turn it off, once it is on. We have only two ways. One is change the time in clock. That too only 25 seconds plus or minus. Another one is change the direction of missile. First we will reset the time. Jenifar, you go to the system. Kalpana, you go to the Theodolite. Thulasi, you go to the radar. Change the radar to the south. Little more. Go to clock in the option. Reset in the clock. Add +25 seconds in the reset. Go to directions options. - lt has opened. - Drag from here. - How many degrees? - 44 degree. Sir, lt is asking whether left or right. You've achieved with your experience in the forest and hills.. ..and your care for the country people, right? Without you, l wouldn't have stopped this. We wouldn't have achieved this without your strength and sacrifice. Sit down. Tamil Nadu Forest officer Ganapathi Ram.. ..gets the Veerthalwar award for his bravery work.. ..to destroy the sneaky foreigners and helped the rocket launch from Velli Malai. Susheela's grandma went to jail for participating in the freedom fight. We have kept her name as Susheela for her memory! We are proud about her even if we are agonised as Ajitha died for our country We will protect our country by sacrificing our life. We will protect the people of lndia and virtues! FAREWELL.
