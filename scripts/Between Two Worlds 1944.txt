IF NO ONE WILL COME AND CALL ON YOU? I DEMAND AN ANSWER! I INSIST ON KNOWING WHY PEOPLE ARE FORBIDDEN TO COME AND SEE ME. WOMEN LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE FRIENDS HERE. WOMEN LIKE... OH! OH! I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED. YOU'VE CONFUSED ME WITH ANOTHER PASSENGER, WITH THAT MAXINE RUSSELL PERSON. YES, SHE IS VERY CHEAP AND COMMON. MRS. CLIVEDEN-BANKS, I HAVEN' CONFUSED YOU WITH ANYONE. AS FAR AS MAXINE RUSSELL IS CONCERNED, I'M AFRAID YOU'RE MUCH LOWER THAN SHE EVER WAS. I BEG YOUR PARDON. HOW DARE YOU? THOMPSON, YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN. SEEMS QUITE THE LADY TO YOU, EH? SURFACE, BERNIE, SURFACE. WITH TIME, WITH EXPERIENCE, HER SORT WON'T FOOL YOU AT ALL. YOU SEE, THIS WOMAN WAS ONCE AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL. THERE WERE MANY OPPORTUNITIES, MANY MEN, AND THEN SHE MET BENJAMIN- DECENT, TRUSTING- AND SHE WANTED HIM- SECURITY, HIS MONEY, POSITION- AND SHE GOT HIM. SHE KNEW HOW. IT WAS AS EASY AS THAT. ALL RIGHT. I'VE HEARD ENOUGH. I'M READY TO LEAVE. I'M GOING TO GE MY HUSBAND. YOUR HUSBAND? HE'S COMING WITH ME, AND I WON'T LET YOU INTERFERE! DON'T WORRY, MADAME. WE NEVER INTERFERE, NOT IN THESE MATTERS. IT'S ODD THA YOU SHOULD WANT HIM, AFTER ALL THE YEARS OF DAMAGE YOU'VE DONE HIM... HUMILIATION. I DIDN'T HURT HIM. HE DIDN'T KNOW. HE WAS ALWAYS OFF PLAYING GOLF SOMEWHERE WITH FRIENDS. YOU REMEMBER HE'D WALK INTO A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE. THERE WOULD BE A SUDDEN HUSH OF PITY FOR HIM. HE NEVER KNEW, I TELL YOU! IT DIDN'T HURT HIM. HE NEVER KNEW. I ALWAYS KNEW, GENEVIEVE. YOU KNEW? FROM THE BEGINNING. HOW DID YOU KNOW, BENJAMIN? MY DEAR, YOU WERE A GREA BEAUTY- ACCOMPLISHED, CHARMING- AND I-DID YOU THINK I WAS SO VAIN AS TO IMAGINE I'D WON YOU FOR MYSELF? AND YET, YOU MARRIED ME. BECAUSE I LOVED YOU. BECAUSE I THOUGH - I HOPED ONE DAY YOU MIGHT CHANGE, FEEL DIFFERENT. YOU DIDN'T. BUT I NEVER BLAMED YOU, GENEVIEVE. I STILL CAN'T. YOU KNEW. YOU FORGAVE ME. OH, BENJAMIN, YOU'RE SO GOOD. WELL, THEN IT'S ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, AND HERE I WAS JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO WORRYING, AFRAID OF BEING ALL ALONE, AFRAID OF A HUNDRED THINGS. HA HA. I WAS SILLY. COME. THEY'VE GIVEN US A CASTLE. IT'S WAITING FOR US. NO, GENEVIEVE. WHY? WHAT... YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T INTERFERE! I'M NOT. IT'S HIS CHOICE ENTIRELY. BENJAMIN... WHY? WHY WON' YOU COME WITH ME? MY DEAR, I'VE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT, AND I BELIEVE IT ALL STARTED WITH THAT MUSIC WE HEARD IN THE LOUNGE- YOUR MUSIC. YES, IT TOOK ME BACK 20 YEARS. NO, MY DEAR, IT WOULDN'T DO. YOU SEE, THAT LOVE I HAD IS GONE, VANISHED. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND. OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND. I DON'T MIND IN THE LEAST. WHY, I'M JUS AS PLEASED. OF COURSE. YOU SAY IT'S A CASTLE, A REAL CASTLE. YOU GUARANTEE THAT? YES, MADAME. OH, IT'S WONDERFUL. I'M SO DELIGHTED. I JUST CAN'T WAI UNTIL I SEE IT. ALONE OR NOT, I KNOW I SHALL BE COMPLETELY HAPPY THERE. GOOD-BYE, BENJAMIN. GOOD-BYE, MY DEAR. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE, EVERYBODY. GOOD-BYE. YOU SWINE! WELL, LET'S GET ALONG. YOU HAVE FRIENDS WAITING FOR YOU ONSHORE, YOU KNOW. WHAT'S THAT, SIR? ARCHER, HAMMOND, SAMPSON, THE LOT OF THEM. SAMPSON...ARCHER... ALL MY CHUMS. WHY, IT'S THE OLD CLUB AGAIN BACK AT CAPE TOWN. AND THE GOLF, BENJAMIN. AH, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH GREENS. OLD FRIENDS, GOOD COMPANIONS, LOVE. SHE WAS SO PRETTY... SO VERY PRETTY. OH, THOMPSON, IT HAD TO BE DONE, I KNOW, BUT I AM SO SORRY FOR HIM. THAT MAN LOVED HER. YES, BERNIE, BUT YOU SEE- HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME? I'M READY. WHAT'S THE MATTER, BOY? I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH. LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH. THEN COME IN. COME IN. I'LL DEAL WITH YOU NOW. NO. WAIT. SO, MY CHILD, YOU'RE HERE AFTER ALL. YES. I RAISED A RUMPUS, HAD A TIME. DIDN'T HELP. I'M TIRED. I WANT TO GO. MAXI. I SAT THERE IN MY CABIN THINKING, REMEMBERING... ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE, ALL THE THINGS THA COULD HAVE BEEN. I WANTED TO CRY. YOU DID CRY. STAND UP TO HIM, MAXI. YOU NEVER CRIED. YOU ALWAYS TOOK IT. LITTLE GIRLS IN THEIR NICE, WHITE MIDDY BLOUSES, FACES CLEAN AND SHINING. I REMEMBER WE USED TO JUMP ROPE. I WAS THE BES IN THE SCHOOLYARD. DID 150 TIMES ONCE. STAND UP TO HIM, MAXI. DON'T LET HIM WALK ALL OVER YOU. NOT YOU. OH, TOMMY. TOMMY. GOOD-BYE, TOMMY. WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR? WHY? SHE'S AFRAID FOR YOU. NOBODY HAS TO BE AFRAID FOR ME. I'LL TAKE IT-ANYTHING THAT'S COMING TO ME. COME ON. I'LL SHOW YOU. I'LL TAKE IT. YOU MURDERED YOURSELF, MY CHILD. EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN THROUGH, EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN AND DONE... THERE'S HOPE HERE. YES. HOPE. OH, IF I COULD ONLY GET BACK TO THAT GIRL IN THE MIDDY BLOUSE. IF I COULD ONLY STAR ALL OVER AGAIN. COME. YES. DOUBLE OR NOTHING. WHAT DO YOU SAY? WHAT'S THAT, BOY? HIGHEST CARD. THREE TIMES OUT OF FIVE. WILL YOU GAMBLE WITH ME? WHAT FOR? DOUBLE OR NOTHING. THAT'S WHAT I SAID. IF I LOSE, I'LL DO IT- ANYTHING YOU SAY. NO SQUAWKS. NO BEEF. AND IF YOU WIN? THEN I WANT DEATH- A REAL DEATH-ZERO. DEATH AS YOU IMAGINE IT. DEATH AS I WANTED IT- BLANK, FINISHED, NOTHING. WILL YOU DO IT? THOMPSON! WE'LL PLAY. HE'S A SPECIALIS AT IT, THOMPSON. HE CAN DO ALL SORTS OF TRICKS. I'VE SEEN HIM. WE'LL PLAY. TAKE A CARD. WAIT A MINUTE. MISTAKE. WE'LL TRY IT AGAIN. TAKE A CARD. BUT I FIXED THEM. I- I PALMED THEM. WAIT. ALL RIGHT. YOU WIN. PICK UP THE MARBLES. DIDN'T YOU KNOW YOU CAN' GET BY WITH TRICKS HERE? WITH FAKERY? NO SERMONS. NO LECTURES. WHAT'S COMING TO ME? I'LL TAKE IT. HELL AND BRIMSTONE. WHAT HAPPENS NOW? NOTHING HAPPENS. YOU JUST GO ON, THAT'S ALL. WHERE'S THE CATCH? NO CATCH. ON THE LEVEL? FINE. SAY, YOU'RE O.K. AT THAT. YOU THROUGH WITH ME NOW? YES. YES. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING. AHA, IT COMES. ONE THING. IT'S JUST THA YOU CAN'T FAKE HERE. ALL RIGHT. I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME. WHAT'S THE TRAGEDY? SO I'LL LAY OFF THE CARDS. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CARDS. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FAKE ANY LONGER. NO EXCUSES, NO DODGES, NO LIQUOR OR FANCY TALK TO HELP YOU HIDE THE TRUTH FROM YOURSELF. STOP. STOP. YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART. I'LL CRY MY EYES OUT. YOU'LL SEE YOURSELF FOR WHAT YOU ACTUALLY WERE- A WASTER, AN IDLER. BUNK. GET OFF ME. YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM YOURSELF HERE, MY SON. NOW AND FOR THE REST OF TIME, YOU'LL FACE THE TRUTH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT OR WHO CAN HELP YOU. ALL RIGHT. FINE. SO WHAT? SO NOBODY CAN HELP ME. PERHAPS I COULD, SIR. YOU AGAIN. ANOTHER COUNTY HEARD FROM. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? EXCUSE ME FOR COMING IN, SIR, BUT I-I HEARD VOICES RAISED. I GREW WORRIED. WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS FOLLOWING ME? I WANT TO HELP YOU. I KNOW JUS WHAT YOU NEED NOW. WHAT? A HO PLATE OF SOUP? NO. SOMEONE TO LOOK AFTER YOU- A HOUSEKEEPER, SORT OF. IT'S A SMALL THING, I KNOW, BUT IF SHE WAS RELIABLE, IF SHE-IF SHE LIKED YOU, SIR, WHY, IT WOULD GIVE YOU A NEW OUTLOOK- MAKE AN ALTOGETHER NEW PERSON OUT OF YOU, BELIEVE ME. MRS. MIDGET, ARE YOU SUGGESTING YOURSELF? WELL, I WAS THINKING OF IT. VERY FINE. VERY FINE OF YOU. THERE'S A LITTLE COTTAGE WAITING FOR YOU WITH A GARDEN BY THE SEA. A GARDEN? A REGULAR GARDEN WITH GERANIUMS AND ROSES? YES, ALL KINDS OF FLOWERS. THERE WE ARE, THEN. THE VERY SPOT FOR US. YOU DON' UNDERSTAND. MR. PRIOR COULDN'T GO TO LIVE THERE. HE HAS ANOTHER ROAD TO FOLLOW- A HARD ROAD. THEN I'LL GO WITH HIM WHERE HE GOES. IT'S VERY SIMPLE, ISN'T IT? YOU'D GIVE THAT COTTAGE UP FOR ME? IT'S NOTHING, SIR. NOTHING. THEN IT'S UP TO YOU SINCE SHE'S WILLING. WHAT'S THE ANGLE? WHAT DID YOU DO, PULL THIS SOB SISTER STUFF TO SHOW ME UP? I'M NO SUCKER. NOBODY CONS ME. I'M HIP! OH, PRIOR. PRIOR. ARE YOU SO WARPED, SO BLIND THAT YOU CAN' RECOGNIZE A DECENT THING WHEN IT HAPPENS TO YOU? I JUST WANT TO BE WITH YOU. THAT'S ALL. TRULY. NO. NO. I'LL GO BY MYSELF. BUT WHY? BECAUSE I'M NO WORTH IT, THAT'S WHY. BECAUSE EVERYTHING HE SAID ABOUT ME WAS THE TRUTH. YEAH, I STARTED OU ALL RIGHT. THOSE FAMOUS SISTERS, TRUTH AND JUSTICE, I WALKED WITH THEM ARM IN ARM, BUT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE ROAD, I- I LOST THEM, OR THEY LOST ME. I DON' EXACTLY REMEMBER. TELL ME, SOMEBODY. WHAT WENT WRONG? I STARTED OUT TO BE A RIGHT GUY, TO HELP THE OTHER FELLOW, TO MAKE MY LIFE MEAN SOMETHING. I HAD THE RIGHT IDEA, SO WHY DID I MAKE A MESS OF MY LIFE- A MESS I'M SICK AND TIRED OF? I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I JUST DON'T KNOW. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU AT ALL. I THINK SHE MUS BE RIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? A NEW OUTLOOK. PRIOR, YOU NEVER CAN TELL. IN TIME, SHE MIGHT REALLY MAKE A NEW PERSON OUT OF YOU- A PERSON YOU WOULDN'T MIND LIVING WITH AT ALL. DO LET'S MAKE A TRY TOGETHER. WHY DON'T WE? YOU-YOU REALLY WANT TO? DO I WANT TO? OH, SIR, YOU'LL NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH. BUT WHY? WHY? BECAUSE-BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE SOMEONE TO LOOK AFTER. IT'S CHEERY. WILL YOU DO IT? WELL, YOU'RE GOING OU ON A LIMB. I- I DROP CIGARETTE BUTTS ON THE RUGS. DO YOU, NOW? I HANG MY COAT UP ON BACKS OF CHAIRS. DO YOU, NOW? I PUT MY FEET UP ON SOFAS AND MAKE A RACKE RUNNING UP STAIRS AND NEVER SHUT DOORS BEHIND ME. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE THINGS? I THINK THEY'RE WONDERFUL. YOU DO? I DO. ALL RIGHT, THEN. I HAVE WITNESSES. YOU WERE WARNED. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. COME ON. GOOD-BYE, MRS. PRIOR. YOU'RE A GOOD MOTHER. HOW DID YOU FIND OUT? HE MUSTN'T KNOW. OH, YOU WON'T TELL HIM, WILL YOU? PROMISE. I PROMISE. AND YOU, TOO- BOTH OF YOU. PROMISE ME. OF COURSE, BUT TELL ME, WHY WON'T YOU LET HIM KNOW? IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT. WHEN HE WAS LITTLE, WHEN HE NEEDED ME, I HANDED HIM OVER TO STRANGERS IN AMERICA, DIDN'T I? ADVANTAGES, I THOUGHT. AND IT WOULD BE A FINE HOW-DO-YOU-DO IF I JUST WALKED IN NOW AND PLUMPED MYSELF ON HIM BRAZEN AS YOU PLEASE. WHY, IT WOULD EMBARRASS HIM SEVERELY- A MAN IN HIS POSITION. EMBARRASS HIM? OF COURSE. YOU'VE FORGOTTEN, YOUR REVERENCE, HE'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL MAN. BUT YOU-YOU JUS HEARD WHAT HE SAID. WHY, RIGHT HERE. HEARD WHAT? OH, I KNOW HE SAYS ODD THINGS AT TIMES, GROWS MOODY. THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S SO BADLY OVERWORKED. YES, HE'S A VERY IMPORTANT MAN, SIR- FAMOUS. A JOURNALIST. OH, IT'S GRAND, ISN'T IT- THE WAY IT'S HAPPENED. I ARRANGED TO SAIL WITH HIM BECAUSE I WANTED ONLY TO BE NEAR HIM, TO SEE HIM, AND NOW, IMAGINE, NOW I'VE GOT HIM AT LAST TO LOOK AFTER. HEAVEN, THAT'S WHAT IT IS. IT'S HEAVEN. HEY, MRS. MIDGET. YOU SEE? HE WANTS ME. YES, DEAR, I'M COMING. I'M COMING... MY BOY. MOTHERS. PETE. PETE, HURRY UP IN HERE. DON'T KEEP ME WAITING. I GOT NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT WITH YOU. COME AND SIT DOWN. ALL I WANT TO SAY IS I GOT A RAW DEAL, AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT'S THE TROUBLE? ALL I WANT TO SAY IS THEY CERTAINLY PICKED A BAD TIME TO GIVE IT TO ME. TORPEDOED THREE TIMES. LISTEN. EVERYBODY THINKS TO HIMSELF THEY'RE A PRETTY GOOD GUY, O.K., BUT WHAT DID I EVER DO THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE? NOTHING. IT'S NOT FAIR. I WAS A GUY THAT KNEW HOW TO ENJOY LIFE, WASN'T I? YES. YOU BET I WAS. CONNIE AND THE KID- EVEN IF I NEVER SAW IT, I GOT PLEASURE JUS THINKING ABOUT IT. AND DRIVING A TRUCK IN THE COUNTRY - WITH THE TREES OR JUST WALKING DOWN THE STREE LOOKING INTO STORE WINDOWS. A MILLION THINGS. LISTEN. JUS ANSWER ME THIS. WHY SHOULD I DESERVE TO GET PUNISHED? NO ONE'S PUNISHING YOU, PETE. THEN WHY DID I HAVE TO DIE? FOR THE TREES, I THINK. FOR THE STREETS. THINGS YOU LOVED- YOUR HOME. AH, WORDS. JUST WORDS, THAT'S WHAT THEY HAND YOU. WAIT. I'M AFRAID YOU'VE FORGOTTEN. AN EVIL ENEMY- MISGUIDED WRETCHES WHO DIDN'T WAN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE EARTH WAS REALLY THERE FOR- THEY SPRANG OUT OF NIGHT TO ROB, TO HARASS, TO SPOIL AND TO MURDER. YOU FOUGHT THEM, PETE. YOU STOPPED THEM. THAT WAS A GOOD REASON TO DIE FOR, MY SON. THE BEST, I THINK. FOR CONNIE, FOR THE BABY. FINE SATISFACTION. I'LL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN. OH, WON'T YOU, NOW? EVERYONE WINDS UP HERE SOONER OR LATER, DOESN'T HE? WHAT? BLOW YOUR NOSE, MY SON, AND CHEER UP. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? THERE'S ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS WAITING FOR YOU HERE. YEAH? DEATH. PEOPLE HAVE ALL SORTS OF NOTIONS. IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE. YOU SEE, MY SON, YOU MAKE YOUR HEAVEN AND HELL FOR YOURSELVES ON EARTH. YOU ONLY BRING I WITH YOU HERE. SOME PEOPLE WASTE THEIR MOMENT ON EARTH- WASTE IT TRAGICALLY. OTHERS... TOSS IT ASIDE, BUT YOU, MY SON, YOU USED I BEAUTIFULLY, AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE USED, AND YOU MAY BE SURE THERE'S NOTHING HERE FOR YOU BUT JOY AND CONTENT. ARE YOU HAPPY NOW? IT'S O.K. IT'S SWELL. I AIN'T KICKING. I JUST NEVER LOOKED AT IT THAT WAY. I'M GLAD NOW. GLAD. BUT, GEE, THOSE HOT DOGS AT CONEY ISLAND. WELL, BERNIE, THAT'S THE JOB, SUCH AS IT IS. THE MAIN THING, YOU SEE, IS JUST NOT TO MIX IN TOO MUCH. EVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE A WAY OF WORKING OUT BY ITSELF SOMEHOW. WELL, THAT'S THAT. WAIT! EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT... WAIT FOR WHAT? I'M FINISHED. OH, NO, THOMPSON. THERE'S THE YOUNG COUPLE. THIS MAN. I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I COULD FOR HIM. I ASKED HIM IN HERE, DIDN'T I? I LET HIM LISTEN AND LEARN. BUT WHAT'S TO BECOME OF US- MY WIFE, MYSELF? YOU HAVEN'T JUDGED OUR CASES YET. THERE'S NO JUDGING TO BE DONE FOR YOU. YOU TOOK MATTERS INTO YOUR OWN HANDS, DIDN'T YOU? AS FOR YOUR WIFE, NATURALLY, SHE'S GOING ASHORE WITH ME. NATURALLY. WITHOUT ME? NO! NO! WE MUST NEVER BE SEPARATED. SCRUBBY. WHY DOES HE SEND YOU TO ME? BECAUSE, HENRY, YOU AND I, WE DIED IN THE SAME WAY. YES, AND THE FATE IN STORE FOR YOU- IT'S JUST LIKE MINE. YOU MEAN I'M TO BE LEFT BEHIND ON THIS SHIP? YES, OR ONE LIKE IT. PEOPLE OF OUR SORT- SUICIDES- THAT'S THE PENALTY WE MUST PAY. BUT WHY DOES HE TAKE MY WIFE FROM ME? SHE DIED WITH ME IN THE SAME ROOM, IN THE VERY SAME WAY. HOW DID SHE DIE, HENRY? IN THE SAME WAY. NO. SHE DIED FOR ME. IT WAS DIFFERENT... ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT. YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY, HENRY- GLAD SHE'S GOING WITH THOMPSON. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU, FOR ANN, FOR A GIRL LIKE HER, THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL HEAVEN WAITING HERE. WOULD YOU WANT HER WITH YOU SAILING ENDLESSLY BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND FORTH? SAILING FOREVER? A SAD EXCHANGE, HENRY, FOR A WONDERFUL HEAVEN. ANN! ANN, LISTEN TO ME, THEY- HERE I AM, HENRY. OH, MY DARLING. MY DARLING. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU. I NEVER THOUGHT, I NEVER DREAMED THAT THIS MOMEN WOULD COME. WHAT IS IT, HENRY? WE CAN'T BE TOGETHER, ANN. YOU'RE GOING ASHORE.

YOU'RE KEEPING US WAITING. THERE'S NO USE WAITING. I CAN' GO WITH YOU. WHAT'S THAT? ANN! ANN, STOP. DON'T SAY THAT. WAIT A MOMENT, CHILD. WE CAN'T PUNISH YOU FOR SOMETHING YOU NEVER DID. IT WASN'T YOUR ACT. IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT. IT WAS. I WANTED I MYSELF. AYE? WHATEVER MY HUSBAND DID, I DID. WHATEVER HAPPENS TO HIM, THE SAME THING MUST HAPPEN TO ME. WELL, THEN, NOTHING MORE FOR ME TO DO. NO. WAIT, SIR. PLEASE. SHE DOESN' MEAN IT. FORGIVE HER. COME WITH ME, BERNIE. ANN, MY DARLING, HURRY. QUICKLY. GO WITH THEM. I CAN'T. SHE MUSTN' STAY HERE.

THE SOUND OF GLASS BREAKING. DON'T YOU HEAR IT? NO. NO. STRANGE. I THOUGHT... WE ARE SAILING AGAIN. IT'S SO BLEAK NOW. THERE IS A CHILL IN THE AIR. IF I COULD ONLY FORGET. FORGET. DON'T LET HIM GO TOO FAR, ANN. IT'S ALL RIGHT. TAKE MY ADVICE. CALL HIM BACK. HE ONLY WANTS TO BE BY HIMSELF FOR A WHILE. IT'S BETTER FOR HIM TO BE ALONE NOW. YOU SEE? HE'S PLAYING. IT MUST BE HORRIBLE FOR YOU, SCRUBBY. YOU HAVE NO ONE. YES, IT'S LONELY, BUT YOU KEEP OCCUPIED, YOU KNOW. FIND PLEASANT THOUGHTS, MEMORIES TO GIVE YOU COMFORT. IT IS LONELY. ENDLESS. ALWAYS THE SAME.
