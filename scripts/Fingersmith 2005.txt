You put the kettle on. Let me see, I wanna see! Susan Trinder? Her mother was hanged for murder. She died a dame, you know. Oh dear girl. Come on then, up you go. Quick, quick. Institute of the insane. My name is Maud Lilly. And I was brought up at the mad house, where my mother died giving birth to me. Maud. Maud have a visitor. A visitor? I can't remember in all these years.. Why is your tongue black? Come on. She is as under sized as her voice is loud. Can't you whisper? Of course I can. Whisper. Can she be silent? Let me see it. My mother, Sir. My sister. Let us hope that we'll remind you of her fate and prevent you from sharing it. Can she read? Blessed are the poor in spirit.. Blessed. Blessed are the poor in spirit. I'll take her. I'll send my house keeper to collect her tomorrow. I won't go! You shant make me! I want to stay with you matron. I won't go! If our friend had known the ins and outs of this little number... he'd never would have been topped. Oh! Oh, look at that! Only since today! You're gonna make our fortune, aren't you Sue? Am I? Ain't she, Mr. Ibbs? I was brought up by Mrs. Sucksby. Who was paid to look after me for a week when I was a baby. But she kept me all those years. If that ain't love I don't know what is. The Bryar bell. This is where your mother lived. You are to be a lady, as she was. Of all her fortune she turned to the mad. It is to be hoped that you turned out better than she did. You haven't finished your eggs? I don't want to be a lady You can't make me. We'll see about that, Miss Lilly. Keep your gloves on... Mr. Lilly will require it. Yes. No one is allowed beyond there. for fear of spoiling his books. How's her temper, Mrs. Stiles? Rather ill, Sir. Have you had her wear gloves? Threw them at me, sir. Give me your hand, Maud. Give me your hand! You won't forget the gloves in the future, will you Maud? No. Put them on. Not a cover is to be touch, not a leaf will be turned without them, do you understand? You realize why I brought you here Maud? To... To make a lady of me. To make a secretary of you. Maud. I couldn't read. All I knew about letters was what I've picked up by studying vipers. I was a fingersmith. A thief. Melt down this little number, will you John. My pleasure. I'd like to melt her down. Don't arse about or I'll knock your bloody head off. Oh, I'll knock it off! Come on! Yeah, yeah, yeah. You just try it. Mrs. Sucksby was a baby farmer. Paid to look after unwanted babies. Poor little scraps. Look at you, treasure. Ah, Maud. I neglected to tell you tonight there will be a new gentleman at your reading. An artist, Mr. Richard Rivers. He'll be here for a week mounting pictures for the catalogue. He'll also be giving you lessons in painting. So they came together. The romance may have been somewhat unusual but that gave it all the charm of the unexpected. And there, as the red sun tinges the sky and the chatter of birds heralds the coming night, we must leave them. Wonderful Miss Lilly! You read so beautifully! If only the patrons of my book shop in Holywell Street could hear you. Your words are pure poetry. Music, Huss. Music. Thank you. Thank you Maud. Mr. Rivers, you say nothing. Does it not please you? I cannot find words Sir. Ah, there you see Huss. The young rouge has beaten us. Indeed, indeed. Excuse me. Now Sir, I have the first edition which you required. Have you indeed? I'm sorry to disturb you but, I'm concerned that you might find it a little... chill out of the fire. The fire is very hot. It is, you're right. Very hot. Very hot indeed. What will you do when this great catalogue is finished? It will never be finished. Come on Miss Lilly, do you really mean to remain here forever? I have no choice. You're young, handsome. I say it not for gallantries sake, I say what I see. You might do anything. You are a man, Mr. Rivers, and might do anything. I am a woman and might do nothing. Chuck diggers on a bitch of hearts. Ain't she slow. What's that? Are we expecting any one? Open up! If it's the blues, we're done for! Open the door! Sovereigns. Under the fire. Come on! Open up. - Open the door! - Damn my fingers! Never mind your fingers, think about your neck! We're all tidy? All right, all right! It's gentleman. Gentleman. Take a taper to them candles, Sue. Put a brew on Dainty. Gentleman told us he'd gambled away his fortune. He was obliged to get money the old fashion way. By thievery, and dodging. I worked on the old man's catalogue in the morning and in the afternoon I worked on her. Taught painting that is. Her maid, Agnes, was the most agreeable chaperon. Love as love will was finding its way. At the end of the week the agreeable Agnes gets scarlet fever. They had to send her home Ireland. The house keeper with bad grace takes over temporarily and is as tight on the girl as a corset. Said she had no time to chaperon. No more painting. Damn it and I was nearly there! Where's there gentleman? She's as rich... as a queen, Mr. Ibbs. How rich? Thirty thousand in ready. Ten thousand in funds. Left to her in her mother's will. She can't touch it unless she marries. And her uncle makes sure she never will by keeping her close. That house is her prison. Are you going to marry her? Well, then I can do what I like with her. When her uncle asks a few questions about you? That's why I've become the exemplary Mr. Richard Rivers. I will... marry her! With the help... of Sue. Me? You're gonna become her friend. Persuade her to trust me. To run away and marry me! Why me? A fingersmith with a heart of gold, Sue. No good in making a bleeding maid out of me, Mrs. Sucksby. Why take my Sue? Because she's yours, and I know she can do it. And how would you cut the shine? Sue will get two thousand pounds. Dainty will do it! I've been a maid, ain't I? Stuck in that pin in the ladies arse, as I recalled. She was an old bitch. You're the old bitch. Think of all the money we lost. Where is this place? Out in the country. Don't know where the bleeding country is. I'm a Londoner. Never been out of the smoke have I? Get on, she would never accept me. You're my old nurses child! Susan Smith. You would have an impeccable character reference from Lady Stonely of Curson Crimson Mayfair. Oh she'll to swallow it, the girls never been to London. She's a bit simple. A pigeon. It'll be a bit of a holiday for you, Sue. And it'll work. Bleeding long holiday if it don't. I won't do it. Not for two. I want three thousand pounds. Take it or leave it. What's that? Another application for my personal maid, uncle, a recommendation from Mr. Rivers. "Susan has been maiden for a lady who's been married and gone to India." "So she has lost her place." "Susan is a very good girl," I wrote, but... and I put this rather well, I think. "I fear that she will go to the bad unless she finds further employment." No! You never wrote that. You never! Oh my God! Who's this cape? Your job. Yeah, you have to dress her. Take them off. Maids don't wear bangles. Shimmy? Chemise. Chemise. You have to warm it. For gods sake! Would you mind raising your arms, Miss? Sue, how many more times? Bleeding frill! She's a lady. Shy. She'll pick up like anything with me and Sue to teach her Why don't you die! There you sweet little bitch! What happens after you're married? I told you she's a bit simple. Living with her uncle will tip her over the brink. After we're married I'll put her in the mad house and there she'll stay. I need your help to get her there. You don't know that. It's in her blood, her mother was mad and she'll end up there any way. Take it or leave it Sue, that's for the extra thousand. Three thousand pounds Sue. And you can have any of the lady's frocks and jewels. She won't need it in the mad house. Is there anything else you haven't told me? That's it. Now, undress her. I shall be glad to meet Miss Susan Smith. All the more so Mr. Rivers. Because she will have... Come to me from a Londoner! Ladies and gentlemen, a toast to Sue. Sue, Sue! Susan Smith. Sue dear. Here's your character from the gentlemans best hand. He'll see you to the coach and join you in a months time. You look a picture, a real picture. I wouldn't like to do it, Mrs. Sucksby. Ain't it a mean trick to plan on that poor girl? Your mother would have done it and don't give me the salt. She would have had dread you doing it but, by God, she'd a been proud. Sue, are you coming? If they catch me, will they hang me? No! They will, won't they? Do you think it hurts when they drop you? No... no. Just a bit... but... they ties the knots special for the ladies so it's quick. Sue. What is this sort of talk? That's not going to happen. You're going to make us all rich. - I am, aren't I? - Come on, you'll miss the coach. Take her out quick, I don't wanna see it. We've never been parted before. I think she took it worser than I did. The country! I never knew there was so much of it! Mile after bleeding mile. Miss Smith? Leave that till the morning. We keep early hours at Bryar. And Mr. Lilly cannot bare noise. If I had known how to get out of that bleeding place I would have scarped there and then. But when I saw her I thought this is gonna be easy. Is all right Miss? That is very satisfactory Susan. - May I call you Susan? - Yes, Miss Thank you Miss. You read of course? A bit. My uncle is a scholar. Books are a very important part of life at Bryar. Please, read me something. Anything. Our father... which art in heaven... I don't read. Oh god! I might be it taught. Miss. Taught? No, I shouldn't allow it! Not to be able to read... I sometimes think how wonderful that would be. When my rooms in order collect me at the library at one. You mean... I'm to start right away Miss? Yes, of course. She was an odd one, all right. Didn't think she was cracked. Not like what gentleman said. Oh! Thank you Miss! - Your coin, Miss? - Get out Go on. Oh my lord! Mrs. Stiles, you did startle me. I was just trying to put Miss Mauds things in order. So I see. These should be given each morning to Mr. Way, Miss Steward. It's his little perk, is it? The pieces of soap that Miss Maud leaves on her wash stand you may keep. Thank you Mrs. Stiles. But I'd really not like to. It hated Miss Alice, she would have thought it thieving. As you wish. Yes. Who the devil are you? My new maid, uncle. The finger! Girl, the finger! You must not go beyond there. Does she have a name? - Susan... - Softer Her name is Susan Smith, uncle. Teach her to speak softly. I will, uncle. Mrs. Stiles keeps the most careful account of wood and coal. Tell her we're economize by burning down the candles right down to the wick. Don't you worry about her, Miss. I know her kind. Do you know my uncles kind? I'm sure he's very clever Miss. Writing a big dictionary. The servants say. I'm sorry Susan. I should have warned you. It's alright, Miss. I certainly won't go over the "finger" in the future. They're very nice Miss. Oh, Susan, they're terrible! But I do hope to improve under Mr. Rivers. I trust he is well? Very well indeed Miss... and sends his compliments. He looks forward very much to seeing you at the end of the month. Do you consider him handsome? Lady Stoning consider him one of the most handsome men in London, Miss. I think Mr. Rivers is a good man. Very good indeed, Miss. Ah... Ahh... Agnes! Is everything all right Miss? Drops! Quickly get my drops! I've taken the medicine ever since I came here as a child. And I'm still afraid of my own dreams. Stay with me! No, I can't do that Miss. Please. That's how it was. That night... and all the following nights... She needed drops and me... to help her sleep. Finger. We were always together, like sisters. Like the sister neither of us had ever had. She wasn't odd. It was only living in that horrible place that made her seem so. She never left it. Never went beyond the river. She never danced, never played games. Like me she had never had a sweet heart. And as the weeks past, I forgot gentleman. I only had that old brown dress. But she gave me some of her own. This is your past. A kind lady with a good heart. Parting, strife. An older gentleman. Very stern, I have no idea who that might be, do you, Miss? Who's that? A young man. I will... marry her! With a good heart. Don't go on Sue. But I must, Miss! Or your luck will desert you! Ah, a journey. After we're married I'll put her in the mad house and there she'll stay. Perhaps a journey of the heart. Show me the last one. It should have been the love card, but I had dropped it. I don't like your fortune telling, Sue! I want to hear about London. What steps they do for the balls. I shall dance, in London. Shalln't I Sue? She could dance like a coal heaver, for all he cared. So long as she as she had forty thousands pound in the bank. Shalln't I? It's so sharp. Shh, open. Saw right where it cut you. Sit down. I used to do this with Mrs. Sucksbys infants. Who's Mrs. Sucksby? A parlour maid went bad, had twins. Open wide. Keep still. Better? Mmm. Mr. Wade! It's Mr. Rivers! Mr. Rivers is back! He must have caught the earlier train. It hit me then. How happy I was. And how much I hated gentleman. I cannot receive him, can I? What an earth shall I do? I wanted to shout out to Maud. He don't love you! He's here to steal your fortune. And put you in the mad house. But she wouldn't have believed me. Welcome back Mr. Rivers, Sir. my boots have been missing you. I'll polish them up like mirrors, Mr. Rivers. I've missed you sir. - Mr. Way. - Sir. Mrs. Stiles. Wonderful to be back at Briar. Miss Lilly, how very kind of you to receive me. Welcome to Briers Mr. River. Miss Lilly. I do apologize. I'm in such a tumbled travelled stained state. Would you rather be taken to your rooms? No, no, no! Miss, this greeting is refreshing me more. It is Susan Smith. I have got that right at least? Yes Sir. Do you like your place here? Yes Sir. I hope you're proving you're a good girl to your mistress, Susan. Susan is very good. I thought she would be. With you as her example. You're too kind, Mr. Rivers. Who could not be... with you to be kind to? The pictures for the catalog must be mounted in three weeks, Rivers. They'll be done, Sir. Three weeks. He spent one week on still life. Still death more like it. And another week... on landscape. He got nowhere. Fresh sheet. For our first landscape. You have an eye for the essence of things. Has she not, Susan? You just need.. What? You can speak plainly to me, Mr. Rivers. I'm not a child. If I could only take you to London to my studio there. You have no lack of talent, Miss Lilly, in terms of artistic creation. You only lack what your sex as a whole lacks. And what is that? The liberty of mind. Nearly ripe, I think. Drops, bad dreams. Good. Excellent. Does she talk about me though? She talks about nothing else. About marriage? Why don't you ask her to marry you? I'll fight her a dead end if I was making a wrong move. Next week the prints will be done and I have to leave. You'll have to work on her harder. Convince her she's in love with me. Damn it Sue, that girl's worth three thousand pounds to you! I saw what the evil bastard was about. He was going to kiss her. But not on her lips. Somewhere better. Much better. I'm so sorry I have to rush back to that wretched print. You will be all right, Maud? Are you sure? Hooked, but you must draw her in. I'll take these, Susan. Get your mistress back to the house. Mr. Rivers has asked me to marry him. Are you not pleased? Sue? What is it? A surprise Miss. I'm pleased. I'm gladder than anything in the world. Than I am sad because I have not said yes to him. Oh. How can I? My uncle will never agree. Mr. Rivers says we might go away at night. Get married in a small church near here. Susan, look kindly on foolish lovers. I'm sure the lights are better in the next room. I'm ever so sorry, Mr. Rivers. But Mr. Lily wouldn't like it. What the hell are you playing at? Keep your hands off her. She don't want it. Don't want it? - The pigeon is crying out for it. - I'll cry and they'll be able to hear. She have to go to the mad house. If you are going soft on me now Sue, I'll drop you. My own nurse will be taken ill and need her sweet little niece and you'll be back in Lant Street with nothing! I'll tell her and Mr. Lilly, I'll tell her! Tell her what you stupid bitch? What you came her to do? She's gone to far to believe you. She must marry me now, or be as good as ruined, locked up here for the rest of her life. I'm her only way out. He says if I am his wife, my uncle cannot touch me. What shall I do? Follow your heart Miss. You love him. Do I? Don't your heart beat faster when you see him? Or when he kisses you? Miss? Oh Miss, don't you love him? You might say no. Say no? And watch him leave? Don't you think I should then wonder over and over again what sort of life I might have had? - Oh Miss! - Yes? What is it? Your mother would have done it and not given it a thought. What is it Sue? Three thousand pounds Sue. Marry him Miss. Mr. Rivers loves you. And love never hurt a flea. All right, I will. But only if you'll come with me. To London. Will you Sue? Be my maiden chum in London? Say you will. I understand the parson is... sympathetic to... affairs of the heart? How soon? It must be this week. And we need somewhere quite to stay. I have a cottage you could use. Thank you Sir. Very much indeed. The wedding was fixed. They were going to elope in two days time, and marry at midnight. Sue... On her wedding night, what must a wife do? I know you're awake. Sue! - For god sake, Miss! - What? You must know. I know something from books... How can you know it from books? You are right. I know nothing, nothing, nothing! What will happen? Will he kiss me? I should think so Miss. Where? On your lips. Is that it? No Miss. The kissing starts you off. It'll come to you, Miss. Dancing didn't come to me. It was very difficult, you had to teach me! Miss Maud! I don't think kissing's going to start me off. Mr. River's kisses never have. You're a beautiful young girl. Look, give me you lips. No.. Not like that. Imagine that I'm Mr. Rivers. There... Did you feel it? It's a curious... - wanting thing. - That's right. You wants Mr. Rivers. - No, I can't do it, Sue. - You can. You must do it now, I mean. It do know what they mean. I mean you must do it sometime, mustn't you Miss? I'm afraid. Don't be frightened. Look. I want to.. once it's started.. Morning. Good morning, Miss. What a wonderful thick sleep I had. And no drops. And no dreams. The only one. I think. I think you're in it Sue. Me? You're marrying Mr. Rivers today. I don't think so. Anything more I can do for you before you leave, Mr. Rivers? We shall be leaving too. Tonight. Miss Lilly! Hello? If I had said I love you. She'd had said it back. And everything would have been different. I might have saved her. I might have found a way. To keep her from her fate. Thank you, thank you. Thank you Mr. Ways, and Mrs. Stiles. I hope it will not be too long until we meet again, Miss Lilly. I hope not Mr. Rivers. Until tonight, don't be late. All that long day I packed, secretly. Getting ready to escape from Briar to the wedding at midnight. Why don't you wear this dress, Miss? It's your wedding night. No, I gave it to you. I'm quite happy with this one, thank you. What are you thinking? I was thinking this was the one you were doing when he proposed to you, Miss. Six hours to go. Time and time again I nearly told her he was a villain. Her uncle would have had me locked up. I could hear Lant Street laughing. Me, in love with a girl! I'll get the bags. Maud? Maud? What the devil is going on? Who's there? It's only me, uncle. Don't wake everyone else up. This way. Quickly, quickly Miss Maud. I Require... as he will answer on that dreadful day of judgement... that the secrets of our hearts should be disclosed. That if either of you know any impediment why ye may not be lawfully joined in matrimony, ye do now confess it. Who giveth this woman to be married to this man? Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband to live together after God alternates to the holy state of matrimony. Wilt thy obey him and serve him, love, honour and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaking all other, keep thee only onto him so long as you both shall live? I will. The ring, like everything else, was bad. He hadn't even bothered to get a gold one. We went from church to a nearby cottage. Where I prepared her for her wedding night. Look at me. It's cold, Miss. Let's get this on. Look at me, Sue! Come here. You did it before, to the sake of tonight. We were not dreaming, were we? It was just to start you off, Miss. Were we... Please, Miss... I have to feel you on me as I can feel your lips on me. I want to feel you inside me. She wants you to dress her. Mauds' discovered the meaning of true love, Sue? It's already half way to the mad house. Now you must finish her off. Here, please see to Mrs. Rivers Susan. She's not well at all. - Morning, Sir. - Morning. I'm really rather worried about her, she's talking so strangely. Morning, Miss. We never charges extra for them, unless they go through the mattress How is she? Taking it hard, is she? Harder ain't the word for it, Mrs. Green. Mr. Rivers dotes on her He can't... I'd say the same myself. You can rely on me never to gossip, Miss She's troubled... up here. You know? Something missing, you mean? No... disturbed, more like. That's why Mr. Rivers brought her to this nice quiet place. To calm her. Calm her? Here? She's not going to get violent and throw things around, is she? Nothing like that, no. What goes on in her head. Know what I mean? But why can't we go to London, Richard? You're not well enough to travel, my sweet. But I'm perfectly well. Aren't I Sue? A few days of help will put colour on those cheeks. I hate it here, I... Morning, Madam. Everything fresh? Those eggs haven't been out of the hen five minutes. She certainly hate me. Oh, Maud. And I hate her. Darling. If I thought it would help I would carry you to the station to my house in London. There is nothing I want more! Look at you. I'm afraid. What is there to be afraid about, my sweet? She ate almost nothing. Took more and more drops. A week of that... and she cracked easy. She thought he wouldn't want her, looking like that. But it was exactly what he did want the mad house doctors to say. The only thing that amused her was to dress me in her fine ladies clothes just as she had done at Briar. - There you are Sue. - Oh! I knew it! That color just matches your hair. Your eyes! You look quite the beauty. Look. It's Mr. Rivers, friends from London, Ma'am. They've come to meet you. Is it this afternoon? - I've forgotten. - Maud, Maud! Visitors from London. Will you receive them dear? Not just now, Richard. Susan, can you spare me a moment? Don't let them hurt her. Hurt her? They won't hurt her, she's money. These men are scoundrels. But they're medical scoundrels. And they won't take her today. And they won't take her at all unless they are sure she qualifies for their care and attention. You know how to answer their questions, don't you? Do I? Don't make game of me Sue, not when we're so close! More? Do you want to go back to Mrs. Sucksby with nothing? We're friends of Mr. Rivers and... would like to ask you a few questions about his marriage, his new wife. My mistress, Sir. Your mistress. Just refresh my memory. Who's your mistress? Mrs. Rivers, of course. I'll say, what was Miss Lilly. Thank you. Mrs Rivers, what was.. Who was Miss Lilly. Yes. And you are? Her maid Sir. And your name is? Susan Smith. You seem to hesitate. That is your name? You're quite sure? If I know anything, Sir, I know my own name. And how did you meet your Mistress. I was with Lady Alice Stonely in Kirtston Crescent, Mayfair. When she went abroad. She's.. She's grown so... Sad. I'm afraid she'll do herself harm. Thank you. You'll keep her safe so much. We will. She's so kind. So good. So loving. You will keep her some place special. Where no one will hurt her. There, there. You mustn't be so distressed. She's been very lucky to have such a good and faithful servant. Very lucky indeed. - Now, if we could see... - This way, doctors. As you can see doctors, the case is quite severe. We will send the carriage out tomorrow afternoon Mr. Rivers, rest assured, it was the right thing. Your eyes are a little brighter. - Are they? - Don't you think so Susan? Oh, such a fool. You only wanted a little company to bring you back to life. You were right. You need London. London? What do you think Maud? Christine Graves is so eager for us to join them in Chelsea, they're offering their carriage to take us there tomorrow. Tomorrow? So soon? Tomorrow we're going to a great house, with fine quite rooms and good servants. Just for you. She was so taken with me in that gown. She wouldn't let me change it. I kept it on to make her happy. Good day Mr. Rivers. Miss Smith. Mrs. Rivers. Mrs. Rivers? What? Don't struggle Mrs. Rivers. We're here to help you. It's not me you want, it's Mrs. Rivers. - Come along now. - Tell her, gentlemen. Tell her! Still the same sad old fiction. I'm not Mrs. Rivers! I'm Susan Smith! Of Kirtston Crescent, Mayfair? Yes! There's no such place, Mrs. Rivers. You know that. Don't struggle or you'll ruin your hat and dress. You bloody swine! You're filth! There is no place for wash like that out here. Mrs. Rivers! You stupid sods don't you see what he's gone and done? Let me go, let me go! It's not me you want it's.. What are you staring at Mrs. Rivers? Surely you know your own maid? Oh my own poor mistress. That bitch. That bitch knew everything. She had been in on it from the start. No! No! Maud! Maud! Maud! No! Poor Sue. She thought she knew me. She thought me innocent. But I was worldly in ways she never suspected. I knew everything. And yet nothing. Remember that to my story that follows. To understand how I could do such things I must go back to the day Mr. Rivers first came to Briar. He said he was a member of parliament so I trusted him. He told me he wished me to meet another member. His member for love. He locked the door, I pleaded for my maidenhood, but... The words are common place but they deserve the frontest piece. Show them Maud. The execution for the member of love. The delicate rendering of the crimson tip. I don't have to borrow, very rare. I had it as a young man, it was sold in difficultly. For a shilling. I would not part with it now for fifty pounds. But having slipped the bolt off the door.. A curator of poisons, as my uncle described himself to me. I was twelve years old when he began inoculating me with poison. Grain by grain, scruple by scruple. So I should be immune to what I read. Be his librarian. And when he lost his sight, his eyes. So they came together. The romance might have been somewhat unusual, but that gave it all the charm of the unexpected. And there, as the red sun tinges the sky, and the chatter of birds heralds the coming night, we must leave them. You don't care for your uncles subjects? I'm his secretary, it's a matter of total indifference to me. I find it rather curious to find a lady so cool and unmoved by something designed to stir the emotions. Most ladies in those books and paintings seem to me to be singularly unmoved by it. You are very uncommon, Miss Lilly. So I understand Sir. Miss Lilly. Dear Miss Lilly, we need to talk. It's about your mother's will. I know nothing of what I read from those books, Sir. I've not come for that, Miss Lilly. I can get that in the street corner. I'm here to help you. How much do you think you'll receive when you marry? A few hundred. Forty thousand pounds. Who told you such nonsense? Hawtrey. You're the talk of the shady book shops in London and in Paris. Your readings and the favors men imagine follow them. Your uncle is a villain, Miss Lilly! And you are not? I came here to seduce you. Secure your fortune. But I saw what life has made of you and I knew it wouldn't work. To a woman like you it would be an insult. Instead I want to free you. You are very gallant, Mr. Rivers. Suppose I don't care to be freed. I think you long for it. Go please, go! Good afternoon, Miss Lilly. Good afternoon, Mr. Rivers. Will you marry me? How dare you? He's lively today, ain't he Mr. Rivers? Not as lively as me, Charles. I swear I will not touch you after the ceremony, we will go our separate ways. Why would you do such a thing? For half your fortune. I'd tell him his idea was nonsense. My uncle would pursue me. Not if he thinks you're in the mad house he whispers. But it would not be me who was locked up. His plan is to install a new maid a compliant chaperon. A thief who will think she's cheating me. Instead, we will cheat her. She will take with her into the mad house all the taint of my mothers madness, my uncles filth, my very name. He is right. I would be free. I return to London in three days. I must secure the maid when I go back. We will never have this chance again! Will you? No. It would be foul. Putting a girl in the mad house. The girl's despicable, a thief. She would do it to you. My uncle will be here at any moment. You must not open that. You belong out there! Not locked up here with this filth! Go! Go! There was an obstacle to Mr. Rivers plan. My maid Agnes. The way he painted that fruit, Miss. You could eat it. He has an eye for it. And for you Miss. Are you all right, Miss Lilly? I think she may have twisted her ankle, Sir. Really, Agnes. I have not. Oh well, we must take no chance of that, Miss Lilly. It's treacherous ground here. Allow me to assist you. I cannot just dismiss Agnes. Leave it to me. Agnes, every time that I've looked into her eyes, I was thinking of you! Mr. Way, Mr. Way! Agnes! I was shaken by what we had done to Agnes. But my uncle had trained me to well to feel it for long. Mr. Rivers returned to London. Recommending the new maid, whose character was as false as her courtesy. Here is the evil little fingersmith who's going to make us rich. Remember, she has to become you. And you her. You have one month until I return. Is it all right, Miss? Very satisfactory. She has come to Briar to swallow me up. Like clutch of eggs. What do London ladies do this time of day? Make visits, to other ladies like you Miss. Ladies like me? There are no ladies like me. But I grew used to her, to her life, her warmth. She was not the gullible girl of a villaineers plot. But a girl with a history, with hates and likings. Yet to escape from Briar I must despise her. Must deceive her. Miss. It's not bad news, is it Miss? Mr. Rivers is coming tomorrow. Oh lord! I must change our dresses. This one for sure. I want you to have that. Me Miss? But this is your best dress? I want to show Mr. Rivers that... That I do so much approve of you. Of his choice. Oh Miss! That's one of the nicest things any one's ever said to me. But really, I can't. I can't, really, Sue. She looked so beautiful. I had to keep telling myself, over and over again, what she planned to do to me. To go on. Oh my goodness, Miss! I look like a real lady. She changed even my uncles books for me. I thought them dead but the words came suddenly alive. Full of meaning. She must think we love one another! Oh damn it, Maud! There's another hour gone. In two days I will leave. And I will never see you again. Wake her up, she'll burn. Let go of me. I've lost half for this. Lost it to a wretched little fingersmith. Let me.. She'd laugh in your face if she knew. If I told her. You mustn't. I agree. Do you want to stay here forever? Appear to love me. Marry me! I can't. Maud! - Miss Maud? - Please. Miss Maud? She's coming. Tell me.. Tell me a way.. Tell you what, Miss? Tell me, on her wedding night, what must a wife do? Aren't you a pearl. Everything I say to myself is changed. She has touched the life of me. The quake of me. But she is ashamed. He'll be leaving here tonight Miss. She didn't love me. her feelings were false, part of a trap. Why should I not trap her to escape from this foul place. The night I escaped, I needed to do one last thing. How fast your heart beats Maud. I told you I don't want to hurt you. But we must show the marks of true love. Are you by any chance bleeding to save me the pain? Do you mean to insult me in every possible way? Hold out the sheet. The fashionable couple on their wedding night. Sit down here Susan. Miss Smith. Were you ever a maid with Lady Stonely of Mayfair? No Sir. That's one of poor Mrs. Rivers fantasies. Ever since the wedding night she's made up these stories. Fiction... Yes. Does she read books? Her passion is books. There you have it Graves. The over exposure of women to literature breeds unnatural fantasies. - Indeed. - Unnatural? Oh Sir, you don't know the worst of it. It's not your shame, Susan, your guilt. You did nothing to invite the gross intentions my wife and her madness tried to force upon you. Is this true? Please, these tears speak themselves. Come on Susan! You are not to blame. I'm so sorry you were exposed to such horrible things. Speak, damn you, speak! Oh my own poor Mistress. My heart was breaking. That is my story. That is what brought me here. You were very convincing Maud. Don't speak to me or I shall kill you. I have betrayed her. Mrs. Rivers. Sit Mrs. Rivers over there, if you will. You see, they tricked me. She's fit, can't do it. Hold her steady, man! She may pull off her joints! We will not have you lying here, Mrs. Rivers. You can choke yourself and it's no business of ours. Chew off your tongue if you like. We prefer them quite here. Welcome to London. How could we have done this to her? Believe me, she'll be better taken care of than where she came from. Are we here? Is this our house? I thought for a moment that was the Briar bell. We're near the river. Chelsea? Not quite. Lant Street. Wow... Come on or I shall leave you here. We cannot live grandly, Maud, until we have your money. We'll just wait for the lawyers to release it. Do you want to stay out here and freeze? Mr. Ibbs. Mrs. Maud Rivers. Very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Rivers. Do come in, make yourself at home. Couldn't you imagine a better night than this, Mr. Ibbs? This is a very good night, gentleman. A very good night indeed. Let me take the ladies cloak. Do beg me a pardon. Who's she? How much are you going to pop that for, Mr. Ibbs. Richard, Richard? Good boy! Marry him, Miss. Mr. Rivers loves you. What kept me alive was the thought that Mrs. Sucksby would find me. And then I would find Maud. And kill her. She lived here, Sue, didn't she? Will you stop touching me! What a fool I've been. What an idiot. This is Sue's house of thieves, isn't it? Honest thieves, dear. Get me a cab. Handsome or haggeny? Don't you dare talk to me like that! Oh she's got a dander, ain't she? If you don't get me a cab I shall walk. I shall find a policeman. Never there when you want them, my dear. Not in this fog. Come on. - John. - Give us the bag. Gentleman, throw it. - Get her! - That's enough! If you don't let me go I will kill your baby. I have come too far for... this. John! I mean it. I will. Get me a cab. I will do it. My dear. I've been caring for unwanted babies for years. At the moment I'm looking after seven babies. Now you can make it six if you like. Or five. No one would miss them. Come on, come on. Go see to the fire, John. Make some tea, Dainty. Strengthen her up a bit. Go on with the mark there, Betty. My poor hands have suffered so much recently. Mrs. Furbisher, Mrs. Furbisher? Do you want the kirk? Where you from? London. I'm a little out of touch. And the season's only just beginning. Are you out? No I ain't. So young. I'm not much in. In... That is the first two word I've heard you say, Mrs. Rivers. In. Keep telling the truth like that, Mrs. Rivers, and you may well be out. Before the end of the season. In! In! In! I couldn't bare to wake you, dear. Feed the babies upstairs, Dainty. Now... Oh... Come on now. I can see you're a spirited girl. But you can't imagine we mean you any harm. I can't imagine you mean me any kind of good... when you insist on keeping me here when I so clearly wish to leave! Just hear the grammar in that, Mr. Ibbs. Here, let me take your glove. Her uncle taught her to be very particular about her fingers. Made you read a lot of filthy French books. Did he touch dear, were he oughtn't? Oh never mind. Better your own than a stranger I always say. I'll get you a nice cup of tea. You plan to kill me, don't you? It would mean nothing to me, but she would not allow it. But has she got to do with this? She sent me to Briar. This is her plan, she controls everything. How does she know about my fortune? From some servant? From her. You're liars. You're cheats. How could you know my mother? I was born in an asylum. Dear, oh dear. We're not going to put that together again, are we? No you weren't born in the asylum dear. You was born here. Marianne, that was the ladies name, wasn't it dear? She ran away from Briar just like you did only her gentleman didn't do the decent thing, not like your husband. She got my name from a woman in the Borough that did the girls in their complaints. Did she ever have complaints, Mr. Ibbs? Too far gone to get rid of the poor creature. She was terrified, poor lamb. It was her father and her brother, your uncle Lilly, they were after her. It's why I made up a bed in front of the fire, like I did for you. And she had her baby right here. Oh! How Marianne loved her little baby girl! Poor little scrap! Then we heard it, didn't we? - The carriage. - Your uncle had found her. He was hammering at the door. And Marianne, she was sobbing. I must name her, I must! But not with a name like I've been cursed with But a plain name. I shall call her.. Maud. Susan. As God as my witness. She cried I don't want to put my baby through what I've been through. Take my baby Susie and bring her up yourself, Mrs. Sucksby. Poor, and honest. She begged and pleaded and It would have tightened her heart to stone to refuse her so... before Mr. Ibbs opened the door I gave her the baby that I was holding. Because she was born on the same day. Take her, quick! That's it. So your brother thinks she's yours. She has the name of a lady after all. Her name is Maud. My name is Ethel. My name is... You must believe me! Susan! Susan! I believe you, Thank you! That's a lot of comfort, Mrs. Rivers. Miss Wilson believes there are creatures on the moon. Damn you! I told you that in strict confidence! I'm not Maud Rivers, I'm Susan Smith! There you are, back with us. I hope you don't oppose this sherry; miss Lilly, sherry in a ladies chamber I could never agree to it but, a bit of honest brandy is a bracer. She's got a good mouth for spirits. I know you are lying. No, you haven't heard anything yet, Maud. I'm an orphan. My mother was mad. And her pa and brother... preferred the madhouse to shame. She went mad when they put her in there. I'll say.. I knew then I was mad... only the maddest... who's brains were over heated were given the plunge. I'm her husband, she'll do as I tell her! Leave it to me, gentleman. We'll do it my way. She'll do it, believe me. Well, I always say brandy is the best sleeping draft Here. If Marianne wasn't my mother then who was? God alone knows, dear. I took foundlings you see, I have the goodness of my heart and you was one of them. This! is Sue's mother. Then, how do I have a fortune? Sit down. Marianne took pity on you, a poor foundling came to a lonely old place like Briar. There was plenty for both she said. Poor woman might have needed it, wouldn't change her mind. She left half to you and half to her own daughter Susan. Due on yours and Susans twenty-first birthdays in one month's time. And you planned to get all of it? Oh, no no, it's Mrs. Sucksbys scheme. She gets the major share, I get a mere three thousand pounds. Did Sue know what you've planned? No dear. You're not any villains, you're fools! I won't sign anything and Susan's in no position to. No, you're right. Sue, or should I say your poor mistress... my wife Mrs. Rivers is in no condition to sign for her, is she? I'll be forced to sign for her. Thanks to your help. What have I done? Damn you, I told you to keep away from me! Leave her! And what do you want with me? Well, we still have to collect Susans half of the money. You want me to be Sue. Oh, she's sharp Mr. Ibbs. I don't believe you. It's because I'm nothing. I don't even know my name. After I've signed you're planning to kill me, don't you? No dear. You're one of us now. And you're a lady. You would be my companion. Because I need a real lady like you to show me how to become one. When you have the money. You are ridiculous. You should both be in the mad house. Pass me off as Sue? Mr. Ibbs will tell the lawyer he's know you all his life. She is your legal guardian. The doctors knows you was a maid, you have no friends in London, no money, no name even. You, as you say, are nothing. And you will do as I say. I will tell the lawyer. How you plotted to swindle an innocent girl? Are you truly so wicked? So vile? That is vile! Poverty. You think life is hard with money? Well, you should try it without. It is one month before your twenty-first birthday one week of barely living will help you make up your mind. Two weeks after the plunge I was prepared to be anyone they wanted me to be. Only the thought of Mrs. Sucksby kept me going. Mrs. Sucksby used to say people ain't never interested in the truth, Sue. But in what they want to hear. I am Mrs. Maud Rivers. This is truly remarkable. I've got you to thank, doctor. You've looked after me so well. You would like to see Mr. Rivers? I need to see him, oh, my poor husband, and my maid. What... Who has put up with so much. How I long to see them both again! And so you shall. Dr Graves... A little test, Mrs. Rivers. Please... write your name. I think it begins with a different letter, doesn't it? Remarkable! the delusion even extends to her motor functions, it is there we will break her. Once your own writing comes back to you, your husband will be here to sign you out. Rivers? He has to sign me out? Rivers? I thought about Sue every day, as Mrs. Sucksby stroke off the days to my twenty first birthday. If only I could escape and get to Sue. There you are, Mrs?... Rivers. Well done. Did you like her? Sue? She turned out bad, didn't she, but? I don't know. I miss her sometimes. She was fun. We used to have a good laugh. Here, you do it. What is it? I don't feel very well. You never do! Is that what they call a ladies constitution? I suppose it must. Ahh! I need to go to the privy. I don't want to bother you. It's no bother, madam. It will be if you're not here when Mrs. S gets back. Dainty, I'm really not well. Come out then. It's my time of the... It rushes! I can't leave you. Open the door. The men might come. But Mrs. Sucksby told me not to leave you. Maud? Please. Help! Please help me! What's happened? I need to go to a hotel. Come on. Rotner Street! O dear, just look at you! Such pretty little feet. And such finely turned ankles. - Let me go. - Now, now. Help! - Don't be silly. - Help! I'm only trying to.. Ahh! Don't think that I wasn't only trying to help you! I walked through the night. Running away if anyone approached me. My thin slippers tore, and my feet were cut and bleeding before I found what I was looking for. The only street that I had heard of in London. The one my uncle's books came from. Miss! Miss! You can't go in there! Mr. Halltree! Maud! Please help me. What are you doing here? You were always saying... That was at Briar before what happened. You mustn't come here. You came through the shop, did the police see you? I won't faint. I promise you. Your feet! Good God! Mrs. Rivers! You have a visitor. Are you here today or not? Don't you recognize him? We didn't know each other from Adam. Then, it was the little boot boy from Briar. It was that look what saved me. He recognized me! He knew who I was. And I knew what I must do in that instant. Oh Charles! Charles, how wonderful to see you! Don't say who I am, and don't go. Oh Miss! I'm not Miss Lilly anymore. You're.. This is a mad house, ain't it? Do you know who I am? It's Miss Smith, ain't it? Bless you! Miss Smith who's.. You mustn't call me that here! That was Briar, Charles.. Mr. Lilly had a stroke after what happened. I'm so sorry to hear that. Gave me the creeps, he did. Mr. Wader Stuart beat me so much I ran away. I've got no job, no character. I wanted to find Mr. Rivers who was so kind to me also. He said I polished his boots better than anyone else in the whole world. And my auntie told me that Mrs. Rivers was living here... and I thought this was a grand house. Your auntie? Mrs. Cream. Where Mr. and Mrs. Rivers stayed after their wedding. Five minutes to tea ladies! Do you want to see Mr. Rivers? - More than anything. - Anything else in the world? So do I. And Mrs. Rivers. Ladies, ladies, ladies! Have you money? Five shillings and.. Locksmith. Get one inch black key. And a file. ONE INCH BLACK KEY! Bring it when you next visit. And I do hope Mr. Lilly improves. I must go in file now. Do come again soon, Charles. Thank you. Rivers keeps you without shoes? So I should not have run away. You cannot run away from your husband. There is someone here he's done a great wrong too. I must save her! I thought if I can stay at your house.. My house? That is impossible, my dear. I have wife and children. I see. Not now! Rivers is entirely to blame. Having taken you he might at least have kept you close. He saw what you were. And what am I? Mr. Halltree? Ah, Thomas. Really, you must not. You seem to forget. I've seen much worse at Briar. Whip your backside until the blood runs down your... Second part down wrong font. They set it in Clarandon, and the rest is in Garamond I think. You're right, so it is. I could work here for you. Impossible. Please. You have been kind. I think you are kind. I beg you, if you could find me some room, at a hotel. - Anywhere. - It's out of the question. Lant street was foul, it was the last place I wanted to go. But I had nowhere else. Mrs. Sucksby! Nobody say a word, but a word. Find gentleman, tell him she's been found. Mr. Ibbs, kettle. Oh my! Dear girl, come on. Come in! Come in get warm. Get gentleman! Be quick! Come here. I knew you'd come home. Please don't touch me, stifle me, smother me... pretend to love me. Pretend? When... Sue's... mother came here... People will tell you that... that I had a baby of my own which died. At least... that's the story around here. Nobody questioned it. Babies do die in Lant Street in particular. Many of time I've sat here... thinking how I last held you when you was a few days old. Imagining how you'd grown. Your eyes. The shape of your nose I'd pictured exact. The paleness of the skin but the hair... the hair I... I always thought... would be fairer. Dear girl. My own... My own dear girl. To have you back... after all these years. Ladies, ladies! Remember, meet me at the wall and don't be late. Of all the burglars' mates God could have sent me... Charles was the worse by a long chalk. Here we are, people want to get to sleep. She said your hands are like poor jobes. - I never! - That makes it swell or what? I never! After all my kindness, Betty. I never, nurse Bacon. She did! Oh God help us, look at what you've done now! And my flesh's blazing. I'll put the cream on your hands, nurse Bacon. I'll do it, I will. It's a small key. Shut up Betty! You'll hurt, Mrs. Wittshire, if you sing another bleeding verse!.. Where are you hurrying? Pee! Charles, Charles, Charles! You said two o'clock! Come on! What kept me going was the thought of Mrs. Sucksbys face when I turned up at Lant Street. And then I thought of Maud... wherever she was. I must go on Miss, or your luck will desert you... A journey of the heart. Oh! Sue, forgive me! Stay here. Miss. Come back Miss! Hello? Hoy, you there! Stop, thief! What are you doing? Come back here! What's going on? Turn around. You took them clothes without asking. I had to, didn't I? Would you rather I got picked up? And never saw Mr. Rivers again? Don't look at me like that. I've never done anything like that before in my life. Don't you think I feel terrible? Stealing from poor people like that? Oh! damn her! Damn her! I don't suppose you want a piece of this pie, then? Charles? There are times in this life when we have to do things that we don't want to do. I'll ask Mr. Rivers to go back to that very cottage... and pay back every penny for the things we've taken and more. Will you? Yeah, that's just the sort of thing that Mr. Rivers would do. Here. Can't believe that in a few days time you will be twenty one years old. I'll make myself a cup.. Oh thank you. Thank you dear. Who was my father? Mr. Ibbs? No dear. Your father was a sailor lost at sea, well, lost to me, dear. Smell it! Smell it, Miss? London! Oh, the rotten, horrible, bleeding, stink of it. - Miss Smith? - I ain't Miss Smith. I ain't Miss bleeding Rivers. I'm Susan Trinder! I thought you said that we were going to see Mr. Rivers? This is horrible! This isn't horrible, the country is horrible. - This is where I live. - This place? Where does Mr... Tommy Joslin. Conindrent, always a good poke. Go on, get in. What is it? Miss Trinder, what is it? Don't cry, Miss. There. Happy birthday! Did you take that from the cottage? Why did you take it? Why? It's because that's what I am. You're kind, you're a ladies maid. I'm a fingersmith, you stupid idiot! A thief! Well, I don't want to be a thief. I want to be with Mr Rivers. You said you promised. Mr. Rivers? Mr. Rivers is the biggest prick unhung! Mr. Rivers, Mr. Rivers got me put in a mad house. Happy birthday Maud! And to our absent friend Sue, might the day bring good fortune to us all. Leave her alone, can't you? Stop beating her. Get out. I will order madam's carriage. Dear Mrs. Sucksby, gentleman and that... bitch has cheated me and put me in the mad house. Send a signal with this boy and help me. Go on, remember what you've got selling. Wait, wait. Put... I love you... as I always will... like a daughter. Half a sovereign, son. No, it's got to be the works. I'll open it up, hang on. She took it. Mrs. Sucksby? Miss Maud. And she gave me this. She's mocking me. What is it? The two of hearts? I'll mock her. Well, he gave me a pound for the watch. Come on. Look who's here. Mrs. Sucksby, visitor. Someone who's fingersmithing cutlery and jewellery! Is that what you've told him? That I stole your jewellery? You've got some bleeding cheek! You nearly broke Mrs. Sucksbys heart! Give me the knife! Give it to me! I've got no argue with you John, or you Dainty. Sue, dear, you ain't yourself. I ain't Mrs. Sucksby, not after what they did to me. Sue, leave now. You'd like me to do that, wouldn't you? Before the gentleman gets back. You don't know what's really happened. I know you've got my clothes. Even got my bleeding bangles! Why? Isn't your fortune enough? Isn't what you did to me enough? Please go! You put me in the mad house. You planned to put me there! I wish I had! To cheat me, to kill me! I will, I will kill you! You old cow! You've been down on me ever since the day I was born! Touch me again and you'll know it. I never, I never I never believed you cut with the jewellery. I went along with the others because they'd thought me a sentimental old fool, But I knew deep down.. Give me the knife. - Did you? - I did, I did! I thought no, not my Sue. You brought me up as your own daughter. I thought I'd never see you again. But I had a man out looking for you. I knew you would! Sue! Your carriage awaits. Hello Charles. My boots have never been the same. Sue? She's just told me what you've done to her. So you'd better go. You found me out, I'm a villain Charles. Honest to god, Mr. Rivers, I never meant to. Get out. Don't let him go. He'll only go to Dr Christie! Stay, stay. Stay, stay. There, there. You're alright now. There, there... Oh damn it, tell the poor bitch how we used her. Richard don't say any more. Oh my dear wife. Have you no feelings at all? Not that I know of. But I know you have. Damn it Maud, what does it matter to you? You're a fully fledged villain now, you don't have to care about either of them! Gentleman, enough! Will you... Now I see the resemblance. No, you see nothing. Nothing. Why did I never suspect it? No wonder you kicked and cursed and she let you. Oh, this is rich! Did you know Mr. Ibbs? No he knows nothing. Stop it. Stop it! Grace? My heart! Your heart? You have a heart Mrs. Sucksby? Feel it here! I should get your daughter to do that. Grace! Grace! She hit me. Get me a surgeon! No surgeons! God damn you! Charlie? Murder, murder! Help, help me! Stop the boy! He's gone. Who did this? She's done it. I saw her. Wait... What happened was the knife was on the table... Maud started to say something else. But nobody heard her. I've done it. Lord knows I'm sorry for it right now. But I've done it. And these girls here, they're innocent girls that never harmed no one. Maud said she'd killed him. But nobody believed her. Because she was a lady. And a lunatic. Gentleman werent a gentleman after all. But a draper's son. Frederick Bunt. The papers said he had been brutally cut down in his manhood. And girls put his picture next to their hearts. I didn't see Maud before she disappeared. Good job. Or I had probably ended up with Mrs. Sucksby. Mrs. Sucksby was so game when the judge put on the black cap, and sentenced her to death. She always looked behind me. As if she was expecting someone else to be with me. But I wanted her for myself. Quite alone. That's good. Just you and me... as it used to be. Oh! Mrs. Sucksby! How shall I do without you? Better dear girl. How can you say that? Watch me tomorrow. Don't cover your eyes. And Sue, should you ever hear hard things of me when I am gone, think back too. We had a collection. It's not very much but... Thank you. How is she? Game... Thanks Tommy. A lady to see you. She won't give me her name. No one will listen to me. You must tell them. If you only came to say that, then go. I've done what I've done and that's the end of it. You must tell them I killed him. No. I was wrong to send you away. And I was wrong to do that to a girl like Sue, a jewel. I hope she never finds out. I will never tell her. I came to see you as well as... Did you? Of course I did. Oh dear. Mother, mother. I wish... Never mind. Just is. Mrs. Sucksby's daughter, isn't it? Sue... Sue? S - U... I, Marianne Lilly of Bear Court... Briar Court sound of mind though feeble of body... commit my infant daughter Susan... to the guardianship of Mrs. Grace Sucksby. In exchange for which Mrs. Sucksby commits into my care her dear daughter Maud. Get some water Dainty! Bit of a shock, is it, Sue? I should says so, Tommy. I should say so. Look at me, Sue. Come here. I heard that Mr. Lilly had died. And so I returned to Briar, to see if I could find something to show me where Maud had gone. Have you come to kill me? No Maud! How could I harm you? I know everything. No... you know nothing. You don't know me at all. How delicious was the glow on her ivory shoulders, as I forced her back on the couch. I scarcely knew what I was about everything, now, was in active exertion. Tongues, lips, bellies, thighs, arms, legs, bottom. Every part in a voluptuous motion... Are they all like that? Every single one. I'm at it myself now. I must earn a living some how. I'm not the good, sweet girl you thought I was. This... is what I am. I know you must hate me... hate me. I don't hate you. I'm.. I'm so sorry for what I did to you, Sue! I'm sorry... True to us both then. I found this in her dress. Someone read it out to me. The money is yours. Did you know who my mother was from the very beginning? No. Not till I got to London. And Mrs. Sucksby never wanted you to find out. She loved you. She did, Sue, she... She said... how wrong she was to... try and turn... a jewel like you and... A jewel? Turn a girl like you into a common place girl. I killed her. I pleaded with Mrs. Sucksby to tell the truth... but all she would say was... that she had done it and... and that was the end. I know. What a mess you're making of yourself, ay? What does it say? They're full of words saying... How I want you. How.. I love you.
