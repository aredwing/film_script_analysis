I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. You mean t's an accident ? A person doesn't fall n love by acc dent. Lani, Chino is a good person. Whatever happened between the two of you before Forget about it. Forgive him. It happened already. You had everything. You were the one who got a good like in America. What about me ? What ? I got rotten in Angeles. You left me there. You owe me this one. I didn't mean to leave you there. I didn't wish to go to America and leave you and Ma. You're my sister. I'm just doing this because I want to help you. But this is wrong already. This is too much. It isn't right. We're sisters. We're both stupid when it comes to love. But do you know our difference ? I am just stupid. You're a traitor. If you'll continue your plan on Chino. That plan, I'm telling you, I'll tell everything to him. Are you threatening me ?

And they were told that your brother was the one who killed him ... What ? What does my brother has to do with this ? Mon was last seen drunk in an event. They were gossiping that your brother had him killed. What ? Daniel, you know that my brother won't do it. I'll talk to Mon's loved ones. Dude, maybe next time. They're still sensitive right now. Come on, I'll go with you. Let's go out guys. Bro ... What do you know about Mon's death ? What ? Mon's family believes that you asked someone to kill him. Why would I do that ? Because of Ian ? Yes, I got mad ... He showed rudeness to my wife. But that's not a reason to kill a person. Can't you see it, bro ? That woman brings bad luck to you. People are dying. And now you're a suspect ? Chino, people can talk all they want. But my conscience is clean. And Lani isn't a jinx to me. She's the best thing that happened to me. And no one can tear us apart. Not even you. Lani, let's talk. We don't have anything to talk about. Lani, be careful with sammy. If he finds out everything, it's going to be dangerous. You're interested even with sammy ? Yes, that's right, isn't it ? You're greedy. You want everything to be yours. If Sammy finds out about your plan of revenge against Chino, you'll be damned. He should be scared of me. Even you. Co'z I wouldn't let you take away Chino. I'll find a way to get him from you. Hi, Gwen. We're going somewhere. I'll follow you. He's crazy over me. Like how Chino got crazy over me before. Just wait. I'll take him away from you. What are we doing here ? I think it's time. Time ? That we start a new family. You mean, baby ? We weren't thinking of a puppy. Don't you want to enjoy our company first ? Just the two of us. Lani, honey ... you're still young. I'm not. I want to somehow be capable of chasing our kids. Not like I'm be ng assisted up walking. I don't want to have one for now. Why ? I'm not yet ready. What do you need to be ready ? Time. We're okay. All we need is a child. You're not the one who's going to give birth ? You're not the one who'll get pregnant. Hi, Sir. Hi, Ma'am. What are you looking for ? We're talking, don't butt in. I'm sorry, sir. What's up, man ? Chino, how's it going ? Hey, bro. Hi. Hi, Gwen. Dude, haven't you heard ? There's already a suspect in Mon's murder. You're brother is off the hook. Who killed Mon ? It's a senseless killing. An addict who picked on Mon. He was a target for robbery. Then he got into it. Oh, babe. I feel bad, for assum ng that it was my brother. You were so doubtful about him. He's thinking too much. That people has bad intentions. That's why I don't know what s t that you like about my friend. I don't know, too. Really ? Ya, You're the one who's crazy about me. What ? It's you who's saying a lot of things. Have you been here that long ? Yes. We've been dancing - Now we're just relaxig "Chino, help me. Your brother will kill me." Oh my god. We should've been here early. We'll actually, we got caught in heavy traffic going here ... And then had to put some ... Excuse me, babe. You don't mind if I step out a bit ? Why ? My friend has an emergency. I'll just go there. Where ? Bro, I'll take care of her. I'll bring Gwen home. - Are you sure ? - I'll come back for you. I'll take care of her. I'll just go back. Okay. Okay. It's okay. Gwen, don't worry. I'll take care of you. Let's have one drink and then ... Guys, cheers ! What are you doing there ? What happened to you ? Your brother hurt me. Why ? He wants to have a baby. I told him that I'm not ready yet. He got pissed off on me. We argued. He hurt me. Hurt ? You don't seem like you got hurt. What's your drama ? Oh my god. Come on. Get up, Lani. Come on. Slowly. "Do you know what Chino's doing with me right ow ?" O, Gwen. Can you drive me home ? Come on. Let's have some fun and dance. Sorry, I have an emergency. One drink, please. Never mind, I'll just take a cab. Gwen, Chino told me to take care of you. He told me to bring you home. Gwen. "Chino, if you truly love lani, I will not get in the way." Hey, listen up. I would like to propose a toast. Okay ? Baby, stand up. To the best woman n the world ... To the love of my life ... Best cook ... Best lover ... Enough. Hey. My little brother ! You know my brother, ya ? Chino. I love him so much, too. I stood up as your parent since you were a kid. I'll do anything for you brother. You're late. Come on, p ck up, pick up. Join us. Bobby. Bobby ... Good friend Bobby. Chino, Lani. Take him upstairs. Come on. Come on. Come on, bro. No, wait. - Sammy let's go. - That's enough - Come on. - Let's go Bro ... Come on. Where's Gwen ? She's gone. Why ? She found out about us. Mom ... Since your new family brought you to America, Lani didn't stop finding some ways to follow you there. She sought the help of foundations that might help locate your father. But everything failed. I was forb dden by the social worker to communicate with you. They told me that ... it'll be better to focus on my new family so I could easily adjust. I'm sorry. I understand you, dear. I should be the one who should ask for forgiveness. I was forced to have you adopted. I can't raise two kids at that time. But Lani, she didn't stop to reach her dream. Spent her whole time on the Internet. Hoping to find a man who will take her abroad. I don't know with your sister. Her weakness is a man. Mom, I'm nervous for Lani. She might get into deep trouble wh le doing her revenge on Chino. She lost her baby because of Chino's brother. Those rich people are animals. They hit your sister like a cat. Mom, hold it. You mean Lani got pregnant. Didn't she tell you ? Chino. Babe. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Gwen, Gwen, I messed up. I messed up big. Look. I ... I don't know where to start. I don't know how to tell you in a way that you wouldn't get hurt. I'll admit that Ian and I has history. And the reason why I know she's one of them girls because I used to mess around with her a long, long time ago. But I promise you, It didn't mean anything, Gwen. Babe, I'm really, really sorry for my ndiscretion with her I know and you witness it. If you have done something wrong, I've got a b gger m stake than you. No, babe, you didn't do anything wrong. This is all me. I know what you're talking about. I know it because she's my sister. Sister ? Hold on. Gwen, what are you saying ? Chino, we're not just sisters. We're the best of friends. We lost touch until a year ago. A year ago. I got a call from her, she told me, she wants to get back to the man who cheated on her. I felt bad for her. I thought that maybe it's the only way to make it up to her. So I looked for you. The plan is ... to make you fall n love with me. And then after that, I'll hurt you. But ... But I fell in love with you. Gwen, Your sister s mad at me. Why did she marry my brother ? Because she got pregnant before, didn't you know that ? You are the father, And your brother is the reason why ... I got Lani pregnant ? You didn't know ? Your brother was the reason why she lost the baby. Rise and shine. What time is it ? Pack up your things. Why ? We're hav ng our second honeymoon You, me, just the trees and cr ckets. No cellphone, no internet, no one will disturb us. Why do we have to go far ? For us not to be stressed. So we could have a good vacation. Sammy started with foul words. He would call me all sorts of names. Until he slaps me sometimes. It depends on his moods. If he has good mood, it would be rough sex. If he's in bad mood, he becomes a sadist. He taught me how to use coca ne. He sells me to his friends. I got hooked up with drugs. Because. That's my only way to escape with what I'm going through. I want to d e a couple of times. He would chain me. Piss on my face. That's why when Papa died, I know he was the one who called PDEA to arrest me. Because he doesn't want anyone to partake the inher tance. Lani is with sammy right now. I'm worried. He takes me to an isolated place. Along with other girls who taste his sadism. A hidden place where ... No one can hear us. And no one will witness. This is nice, right ? It's just that it's too hidden. Even if we scream here, no one will hear us. What if we're too late ? Honey ? Let's go downstairs. Okay, I'll follow. Okay. You really think I didn't know that you and your sister are making fool of me and my brother. Do you think I'm stupid ? I refused to accept what I saw. But I started ... To open my eyes and ears. He should be scared of me. You should, too. Co'z I wouldn't let you take Chino away from me. I'll do everything to get him from you. Until I saw with my very own eyes. Damn you. You are the only woman I loved. Do you know that ? How does my brother make out with you ? Like this ? Like this ? Who's better ? Him or me ? Who ? Sammy, that's enough. How does he kiss you ? How does he kiss you ? Sammy, that's enough. Lani ! Lani, what happened to you ? Your brother ! He's hurting me ! Where is he ? He's inside the house. Bro ! Bro, I know now everything. Bro, let's talk. Bro ! Bro don't do this. This is all my fault. Don't ruin your life because of me. Bro ! Chino ! What are you doing ? I'm glad you came, bro. Did you know that these sisters have been making a fool out of us ? Don't tell me you came here for her. To save this whore. I came for you. Why are you doing this ? This is enough. This is wrong. Don't do this. You know, since you were a kid I promised mom, that I'd take care of you. That's why I'm tell ng you. No one can get between the two of us. I know that, bro. But what you're doing sn't right ... It isn't really right ! Co'z I wouldn't let that these two will get between us. That's why they should get out of our way. Gwen ! Bro ! Enough ! I told you, it's enough. Chino, let me go. Don't do this, bro. Gwen ! Bro ! Gwen ! That's enough ! Don't interfere ! Enough !
