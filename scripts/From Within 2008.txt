Can you just put it away? You're not going to like this. Ever notice your reflection's better-looking than the real you? What's that? Your reflection, it's the same, but different. I don't know, it's better-looking. Lindsay, focus, please, the dress. I don't got all day. What do you think? It's too drab. You're saying that about all of them. Because they're all too drab. Well, you got to choose one. I can't have you showing up to church in the same damn thing all the time. And you're showing too much skin. Here we are, ladies. This has Lindsay written all over it. It just arrived yesterday. It's supposed to be the new look or something. That's a proper young lady, right there. My daughter Natalie is no better. You should see what she does with her clothes. Hacks off the bottom, cuts off the sleeves, dyes everything black. You got to talk to her. I try. Come on. Not everyone can dress the same. It's not about conformity, Lindsay. It's about respect for the Lord. Natalie? Natalie? Oh, God. Lock the door, Dad! Natalie, calm down. Breathe. Where are you hurt? It's not my blood. Do you see her? There's no one out there, Nat. She was right behind me! Whose blood is it, honey? It's Sean's. He's... He's dead. It's okay. Listen. He shot himself. Everything's okay. Just stay calm. Okay? I'm going to set you someplace safe. Trish, watch the door. That's good. You're doing real good, real good. All right. Honey, you said the blood belonged to Sean. Did he... did he try to... I got to find somebody who knows... Natalie. ...what he lived. Did you see her? I didn't see anyone. Shut the window! Shut it! Who'd you see? I don't know. You see something? No, but she said that... She's in shock. She was right there. She was right behind me. Can you ask my dad to look, please? Can you please just ask him to go and look? She keeps asking about some... - What did you do? - Nothing. Tear it down. - No! Please! - Natalie! Open the door, honey! Open the door! Natalie, open the door, God damn it! Open the door. Daddy! Oh, no, no, no! No, Natalie! What have you done? No. Natalie, no. Please, no. It'll be all right. Just... Lindsay. You okay? Come on, let's go. Hi, Sheriff. Sheriff Cooper. The girl, she killed herself? Go home, Aidan. We learn anything more about her or your brother, we'll call you. I don't know how she could do it. She saw her boyfriend kill himself. It was suicide of passion, like Romeo and Juliet. Juliet drank poison, not stabbed a pair of scissors into her neck. She had this book with her. I don't know, she wouldn't let go of it. Whatever. I mean, she's always been fucked in that. You've seen her, dressed in leather like a dominatrix in training. There was so much blood. God, it sucks you had to see it. No shit. Trish is probably going to make me feel like the whole thing was my fault. Screw that. She's not your real mom. Okay, like, that gives you license to ignore her. What? Come on, it ain't a sin. I heard Jesus drank wine every chance he got. He didn't live with an alcoholic. Dylan's downstairs. Hey. We missed you at Bible class tonight. Are you kidding me? Look, Lindsay, it's times like this when we need the good Lord the most. Look, bad... No, I'm good. Bad things happen, but you got to believe some good's going to come out of it. I guess. See, you don't have to guess. It's written. Trials and tribulations bring people together. You always know what to say. I can't help it. Son of a pastor. It's in my blood. Hold on. I got a little something for you. Oh, it's stupid. - Thank you. - You're welcome. We're closed. Hello? ...the tragedy that has struck here in these past few days. According to many who knew her, Natalie Wilburn was a normal, happy 17-year-old. Yet, on this particular morning, with no apparent warning signs, this young woman abruptly took her own life here in father's clothing store, apparently as part of a suicide pact. A few hours earlier, she'd watched her friend Sean Spindle initiate the pact... You hearing this? ...by killing himself in the early morning. That kid was one of Candace Spindle's sons. So? ...death of his mother, Candace Spindle... The witch. ...who died tragically in a fire six months ago. I'm failing to see the humor. Come on. Why is she a witch? She killed Jimmy Grogan. Jimmy Grogan drowned. In a lake by her house. That doesn't mean she killed him. Look, the truth was there for all to see. You saw how Natalie was. That stuff don't come from nowhere. And I'll tell you what. That book she had on her, I'll bet you that was no Bible. Mom, what are you trying to say? I'm saying if you believe in the light, you got to believe in the dark. Shit, man. It's hotter than you out there. Hey, mama. - Hi. - How you doing, baby? All right. All right. Yeah, I guess you look all right. All right. Come on, Cinderella. Shake a leg, huh? Let's go. I just got a little hard. Well, God bless you. And welcome today. We are so glad to have you here today. Welcome to God's house. And we know that God has good things in store for every one of you today. We love you. We believe in you. And how many of you know that God loves you? Yes, he does. He loves you. He loves every one of us. Now, I find that the more I praise God, he lifts my burdens and raises my sprits. Amen. Amen. If you cast down your burdens, and you say to God that He is bigger than all the problems in your life, you will be saved. Amen. Amen. But today is a sad day for us. Death is never a welcome guest. But there is also a reason to rejoice because our Lord has made this day. Almighty God, who rewards us for believing in him. Praise our awesome God. Almighty Father... we love you, and we worship you with all our hearts. We open ourselves to your control and your infinite wisdom. And we know that when life takes a turn for the unexpected, it is you taking us on a road of devotion. Amen. We sing praise for the Lord, yes We sing praise for those good times We sing praise for the joys he brings us Oh, yeah What was that? What it always is. No, it's always passionate and to the point. And you skimmed over what happened like it was a traffic accident. I said what needed to be said. Look, Candace Spindle's sons came back. And now, one of our own is dead. It's a tragedy. That's it. Dylan, you watch your tone. I'm fully aware of what this town needs. No. What this town needs is the fire of faith. And you gave it words from a prayer card. Uncle Bernie? It was a lovely ceremony. Poor Bernard. He couldn't even make the service. Shit, man. Can you blame the guy? If my daughter rammed a pair of scissors into her neck, I'd be fucked up for life. Surprised you two ain't more fucked up for seeing it. Well, we didn't see her do it. They don't even know if she did it for sure. Could be a killer out there, for all we know. Shit, man. That's where Bernie is. He's hunting the son of a bitch down. You know what I'd do if I found my daughter's killer. I'd make him swallow a pair of scissors. Then I'd cut his tongue out. Then I'd take a leak on him. Jesus, Roy, you got a sick mind. It's what you like about me, ain't it? Yeah. That and my big heart. My big, fat heart. Hey, Lindsay, you like my big, fat heart, don't you? Hey, sweetie, you ask about that job yet? Dylan wants me to go back to work at the church, more clerical stuff. Oh, honey, that's an honor. After all we been through, that's exactly what you need. Shit, man. What'd I do now? Man. All right. You guys wait here. Bernard's dead. Oh, no. He hung himself. ...interpretation. Analzye and re-analyze. But most of them turned out very, very well. Who would've thought Bernard, of all people? I guess losing Natalie was more than he could handle. All we can do is pray. For him or us? Us? People are saying things. Like what? Like, you know, maybe it's, like, a suicide pact. What the hell is this? Mary, what's up? Dylan's going to kick his ass. - Whose ass? - Wait, Lindsay. Dylan? That guy's a freak. Dylan? What's going on? No need to worry. Dylan, what are you do... Don't you worry. No need to worry. Don't you look at her. For God's sakes, Dylan. They worship the devil, Lindsay. You can't worship something you don't believe in. Satan's a creation of your religion. Hit him, hit him. Harder. Stop this right now. Dylan. Thy pain is thy cleansing. Yeah, man. Good job. Yeah, Dylan. Thank you for helping me. Sorry about your brother. Thank you. I'm Aidan. Lindsay. You seem to know your way. We used to sneak back here. For a good scare? We were kids. It's okay. My mother actually liked the visits. She loved children. It's the adults that made her suffer. Are you coming in? No, I shouldn't. You've seen the outside of the house enough as a kid, you might as well see the inside. You got stuff for those cuts? Inside, I do. That's my great-grandmother. Do you play? No. Do you believe he killed himself? He hated himself. He always did. When I found his body, I wasn't surprised. Do you have any other family? I have a cousin Sadie. She's coming down tomorrow from New York for the funeral. I haven't spoken to my father in a year. That's where they killed her. I thought the fire was an accident. Well, that's what they said. Crazy woman tripped over a few candles. Fire spreads fast, and she's trapped inside. It was retribution. I guess it didn't take much for them to blame her, especially since what they said she was. I'm sorry. Why'd you and your brother come back? This is the house we grew up in. It's our home. That's her. She's beautiful. You remind me of her. Really? I don't mean looks. It's how you carry yourself. How you treat people. Is that you and your brother? That's me. I've never seen that side of Dylan. You have to believe me. His other side must be something. When... When my father died, I was lost. He came... he came to me from the church, pulled me through a bad time. Loss brings people together. What is it? Nothing. It's just that Dylan said something similar recently, about trials and tribulations. Billy, is that you? What are you doing here? Who are you? Come to me. What are you doing? Hey. You can sneak a peek, honey. I ain't shy. Where have you been? Out driving. Don't you lie to me. I wasn't doing anything. I think I'm going to leave you to it. Roy. Roy, we have that thing tomorrow night, though, right? Oh, yeah. Just give me a call. Dylan called. So? He says you were with the Spindle boy. Did Dylan also mention that he beat him up? That boy touch you? No. I was just helping him. We just talked. Oh, I'm sure that's all you did. You're completely soaked. I can see everything. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, treating Dylan the way you do. - Look, I just took care... - You went home with a stranger, and one from a very questionable family. Come on, you've never met him. He's decent, and his family's been here way longer than us. Was he playing the victim for you? Poor little boy in need of help? No. We tried to bring them into the fold. We went to that house. We invited them to church. We welcomed them with open arms. And then you realized they were different. Their beliefs are rooted in darkness, sweetie, - pure and simple. - Maybe... When they rejected God, they rejected us. Maybe they just wanted to be left alone. Maybe that boy just wants to get laid. I don't like talking to you when you're like this. - Like what? - Piss-ass drunk. ...6, 7, 8. Pull back, 2, 3, 4. Step together, 6, 7, 8. Great. Let's try that from the top. And 5, 6, 7, 8. To the front, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And roll, 2, 3, 4. Other side. 6, 7, 8. Bye, Dad. See you later, sweetie. And actually, it takes us to our last question that we have when we're analyzing, um, Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. And the last question I have, then, why would Marlow, why would our narrator, point-blank lie when Kurtz' fiance asks him what Kurtz' final words were? Whatever. They're just jealous. That doesn't make me feel better. What'd you expect? I mean, you're already dating the pastor's son. Who's, like, Grovetown royalty. And now, the Spindle kid has taken a shine to you? Aidan? Why do you say that? I heard you rescued him. No, I... I just drove him home. Wow, you're more wild than I give you credit for, girl. No, we just... we just talked. I thought he could use someone to comfort him. Oh. Is that what they're calling it now? Claire. Were there sparks? Come on, it's a little much to ask for. Well, I ask for it all the time. Just... Just be a little careful, okay? I can't control what people think. Right now, they see you as being on his side. Okay? They praise God for the good and blame the devil for the bad. It doesn't matter. Come on, I don't plan on going back there. Well, maybe I'll stop by later. You can take me to meet him. Maybe he has a friend you can hook me up with. And the weak will walk away, but the strong, the strong will deal with the son of Candace Spindle, this godless heir to a murderess mother. And a festering sore of heresy. Don't you touch him. Well, that's a relief. I was beginning to think I didn't exist to you. You know why I'm not talking to you. Look, I did what I had to do, Lindsay. You'll come to understand that. I doubt it. The suicides all started with the Spindle boy, okay? Natalie had that book. Come on, it's just a book. That's like saying the Bible is just a book. It's different. I mean, the cops will check it out. No, see, the cops... the cops don't have it. They gave it to my father to judge what it is, what that boy is. Leave him alone, Dylan. I don't believe this. He's gotten under your skin. You're going to see him again, aren't you? That's fine, you know. That's great, but just know this. This town takes care of its own. Hello? The door was open. So that makes it okay? If your pants are open, can I go in? Well, if you're not going to rob us, might as well do the name thing. Sadie. Um, Lindsay. I came by to see Aidan. New girlfriend? No. We're not... You're the cousin. Yeah, he mentioned you were coming. I drove down when I heard. Blew his brains out. What am I supposed to do about it? Play date's here. I see you met Sadie. Can I talk to you alone? I got to get to the funeral. So what is it? It's not safe to stay here. Do you know something I don't? They think you have something to do with the suicides. They're scared. So? So I came to warn you. Come on. Look at your face, Aidan. Those cuts and bruises are there for a reason. This isn't about pride. It's about some rednecks coming to kill you. You need to talk to the cops. My mother didn't run, and neither will I. Come on, you're being stupid. These people are dangerous. What the fuck was that all about? She came to warn us. We don't need outsiders involved. I can handle it. They killed your mother. You think they won't do the same to us? I wish Sean were here. Look, multiple suicides are unusual, but they can happen. Bunch of kids see the same damn movie... it's called "suicide hotspots. " But are they the result of some kind of, what, curse? No, I don't believe that. They do. Come on, you know how it is here. It's God and the devil, good and evil. There's no in-between. - Look, Lindsay... - You ever find out what happened to Aidan's mother? To Candace Spindle? She died in a fire. It... It wasn't murder? That investigation is closed. She died a week after Jimmy Grogan was found. People thought she killed him, so they got their revenge. They'll do the same thing to Aidan. They're blaming him the same way. Look, Lindsay, people here are just passionate. That's all it is, passion. It doesn't make them murderers. Come to me. Please! Let me out! Please! Please! Claire. Thanks for coming. What is it you wanted to tell me? Someone likes us. It's not going to stop with that. Still wet. Let's talk somewhere else. My mother used to come here. You shouldn't come around to the house anymore. You brought me here to tell me this? This is where my mother practiced her religion. She'd read from her grimoire. It's a book, a collection of rituals. What does that have to do with this? Go far away from here. Leave Grovetown. Dylan, Paul. You know why we're here, Sheriff. Why don't you fill me in, Dylan? 'Cause you know exactly what's happening out there. These aren't just suicides. This is something else, something worse. And that idea would be based on what? Faith, Sheriff. But I don't expect you to understand that. The lost never do. - Listen... - No, you listen to me, all right? This all started with the death of Candace Spindle's youngest son. What are you gonna do? You might want to watch that tone, son. I've been waiting for you, sweetie. Trish, are you okay? I will be. Once it's over. Over? What... Who else is here? I love you, Lindsay. You know that, right? Roy? Hey, what's going on? Now get her... her hands. No. Watch her head. No. What are you doing? Let go, please. Be still. Come on. Be still. We gotta cleanse ourselves, sweetie. We were both at the store when the girl died. And today, I saw something that made me know there's a curse. There's something I gotta tell you. I'm so sorry, sweetie. Claire's dead. Hey, hey, come on. - Be still. - Come on. O Lord, send down your blessed hand and cast out the evil that has entrapped this innocent. O Lord, send down your blessed hand and cast out the evil that has entrapped this innocent. O Lord, send down your blessed hand and cast out the evil that has entrapped this innocent. O Lord, send down your blessed hand and cast out the evil that has entrapped this innocent. O Lord, send down your blessed hand and cast out the evil that has entrapped this innocent. It's all over, sweetie. Nothing to worry about anymore. I felt the power of the Lord in that church. And I saw a vision of the Virgin Mary. We're saved. Lindsay? Say something. Fuck you. And we're just gonna do pulses. Here we go, ready? 4, 3, 2, and 1... Lindsay? You. Trish? Are you okay? Trish? Roy... Roy, you can't go in there. - Don't touch me. - You can't go in. - Come on. - Don't touch me. Don't... You can't go in there, Roy. - Let me see her. - Relax. Let me see her. Let me fuckin' see her! Come on. Go home, Roy! You don't wanna be heading back to jail, son. I want to go back. Look, come on down to the station tomorrow. We'll give you a full report, okay? You'll give me a full report on what the fuck's going on here? I'm sorry about Trish. Sorry about Trish? You sorry about Trish? Did you see it? It's inside me. I have it. What am I gonna do? It's inside of me. - Lindsay... - I'm going to die. It's real. No, it's not real. It's not real. But I saw. It's in your mind, okay? - It's just your mind. - I heard Trish running like... someone was chasing her. That's because what she saw looked real to her. Okay, but she was alone. Let's be real, okay? It makes you do it. You. Now this. Do they see what I see? Do they see themselves? That's what we're dealing with. You against you. But I'd never kill myself. And Claire... You have to help me. You have to do something. I don't want to die. Come with me. Those spells use energy. Null energy can be slowed. This should weaken its flow. It won't stop it, but it should weaken it. Think of it as a thin layer of armor. A layer of armor, protecting you. Relax. Allow it to work. Does every part have to be covered? I think we're good. Just... Try not to... Try not to what? Try not to sweat it off. All finished with the rubdown? Really gets your juices flowing, doesn't it? You said the curse is spreading? When will it stop? L... I don't know. So, this, the suicides, It's like a plague? Now it can spread everywhere? How could something that serious be lying around in a book? Man's own act of suicide... If you are willing to pay such a price. Sean was willing. The spell is like a key. If it can open something, it can also close it. What we need is the book. I think I know where it is. You stay and watch the house. Oh, is it the house I should be watching? I know what I'm doing. I used to work here. Where are we going? He thinks it's unholy, dangerous. I think I might know where he put it. Protected by God. Do you have the key? Stay with me, Lindsay. Stay with me. Don't let it get in, okay? I know it's hard. But, you've gotta keep it out. Don't look at it, Lindsay. I'm protecting you. You just have to stay calm. - Don't give in. - Real. You're not real. You're not real. You're not real. Sean's blood, isn't it? Can you do the ritual? I can try. I'll need some supplies from upstairs. You better go get them, then. Another way to save the world. See. We should have gotten rid of the book when we had the chance. We don't know what's in that thing. - How did Trish... - Poison. Cops say she killed herself like the others. That's bullshit. And Lindsay? She called the cops, said Trish was dead. When the cops came, she was gone. Pastor... We tried it your way, okay? And I... I don't mean to be disrespectful, but it didn't amount to a steaming pile of shit. Roy, in all places. Had to be said. I'm sorry. Have you all lost faith in the Lord? This has to be handled. No. I cannot condone this. We can't take this into our own hands, not again. This man lost his daughter. Son, look into your heart. What happened last time was wrong. How can you say that? Weeds must be pulled from the garden. That sound familiar? What happened to Candace Spindle was a mistake. One that I have had a very hard time living with. Oh, I'm sorry that you suffer, Father. Only problem is is that weeds grow back. Leave him with his gardening. - Dylan... - I've heard enough. I want to speak with you. I'll meet you in the truck. Look, you know this is right. He's gotta answer for the deaths, just like his mother did with Jimmy Grogan. When Jimmy came back from the war, he was deeply troubled. - I don't have time for your guilt, okay? - You don't understand. Jimmy... Jimmy needed someone. He came to me. We talked. We spent some time together. Okay, you're a pastor. That's what you do. No. Not like this. I gotta deal with this later, okay? He was gonna tell everybody. Grovetown is built on a bedrock of faith that I instilled. I had to do something. And what was that? I didn't have a choice. Leaving him in the lake made it easy. Everybody blamed that poor woman. This conversation dies in this room, you hear me? Well, that's up to you, son. If you harm that boy, I will tell everyone. Because your weakness is your own? If you want to tell everybody, go ahead and tell them. My true father reigns in heaven. His work shall be done. Aidan, once this is over, will you leave here? Will you leave Grovetown? I won't be returning after tonight. I want to come with you. Excuse me while I throw up. - Give it to me. - You... Give me the fucking book. - Sadie, why are you... - Shut the fuck up. You think I won't... Think I won't kill you for it? Think I won't kill some bitch for it? All right. Right here. Your brother died for this, you shit. Sean was wrong. We all were. What happened to you? We decided on this together, you and Sean. He gave his life. What's going on? The curse. He found it. It was his idea, honey. Aidan wanted everyone in your pretty little town to die, you included. This is true? Seems you two have a lot to talk about. It was a mistake. Sorry, choir girl. Burning times are back. Except this time... it's for the rest of the fucking world. Come on. Why would I go anywhere with you? - Lindsay... - You lied to me. We don't have time for this right now. You're killing people. Sadie will destroy the book if we don't stop her. And then... And then you will die. Paul, you grab the front. Hey, Lindsay might be inside. - Yeah, so? - So be careful. Lindsay! - Lindsay! - No! Sean died for nothing. Go! Aidan! Knock-knock! We want to talk to you, Aidan. Lindsay? We're here. Come out now. We won't hurt you. No we won't. Upstairs. There's nobody down here. Oh, fuck! - We got her! - Shit. Fuck! No. Where's Aidan? No, no, no. No, go back. Oh, shit. That hurt, huh? Can't you do it here? No. I need time. Your worthless god can kiss my ass. What was that? Hey, stay here. Take care of the bitch. Fine. I'll take care of her. Paul, to the woods! Lindsay! The devil must be strong in you. The mother went much easier. It was in prison that the Lord came to me. Then he gave me a purpose. One night, after a... particularly painful day, he spoke to me. And he said to me, "Hey, Roy?" Then, I said, "Yeah, God?" He said, "I want you to be a soldier. "I want you to be a soldier of the Lord. " "And anytime there's a soul that's lost or... " "possessed or beyond hope... " "I want you to send that soul straight to hell. " Now, are you gonna pray with me? No. Well, then I'm gonna need you to shut the fuck up. Lindsay! I gotta draw 'em away. Meet me by the pier. Look, I just want you to understand my work here tonight is God's work. I am an instrument... ...of his will. My hands... ...are his. No, no. No, no, no. I know. Our Father, Who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy name... It wasn't my book. Aidan! Aidan! Thy pain is thy cleansing. Lindsay? Lindsay! Stop. Stop! Stop. Stop, hey... Stop. Look at me. Look at me. It's me. How long will it take? Not long. Is it over? You remember when I told you certain spells... require a terrible price? What I need to do... You have to understand, Sean gave his life to start the curse. What are you saying? Sacrifice started it. And sacrifice needs to end it. It's the only way. No. No, it can't be. No, Aidan. Please, no. You have to destroy the book after it's done. Listen to me. You have to make sure that it can never be used again ever. Aidan, please... Promise me you'll burn it. No. It didn't have to be this way, Lindsay. I thought that we were meant to be together. I thought it was God's plan. Dylan, put the gun down. She's become one of them. She abandoned the Lord, Paul. What, is it your turn to kill yourself? Oh, I get it. You can't let your man's death go unanswered. - Dylan? - Would you shut up, Paul? Can't you see Lindsay's having a little moment here? Don't do this. Walk away, please. Walk away. I don't walk away. Ever. My faith is my anchor. I don't know the record for suicides in one town, but we gotta be climbing the charts. This wasn't a suicide. Lindsay said he shot himself. Well, she was wrong. He may have tried to blow his brains out. Dylan shot him in the chest before he got the chance. Subtitled By J.R.
