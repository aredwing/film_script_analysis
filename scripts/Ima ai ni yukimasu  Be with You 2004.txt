The truth is, the store is going out of business. Is that so? But things turned out all right because I could keep my promise to the end. I'm grateful to you for doing this for such a long time. I wish you a happy birthday. Thank you very much. Yuji. Yeah? What happened to the new toothbrushes? I told you yesterday. That year... in the season of rain, the miracle that came to us... Began in this forest. A miracle of 6 weeks. Perhaps it may have been... A magical vision of the other side of the fog. However... There is no mistaking... That we met my mother. Be With You... It's already been a year since Mio passed away. Are things going well for you, Takumi and Yuji? You're not in good health, Takumi. It really was... A mistake to have Yuji so carelessly. It was that difficult a labor. Are you raising Yuji well? Hey... Where do all the people go when they die? They're all at the Akaibu star. Your mother is on that star too. Well, can Mommy really come back? Hmm? Won't she? Because Mommy doesn't lie. Then when the rainy season comes... Mommy will come back It's true, right? Yeah. All set. Let's eat. OK! Sorry, I messed up the fried egg. That's all right I can eat it. Let's enjoy the meal. Let's eat. Dad, I'm heading out first. See you later. Dad. Yeah? Don't be late! All right. I'm leaving. OK. Got some on me. I'll be back later. Takumi. Yes? This is for special delivery. OK. - Do it like this. - Ah. It will be easier to take care of things in this order. Thank you. Not at all. Pardon me. Yes? I'm sorry. Not at all. - So this is just a question but... - Eh? You're wearing winter clothes so... I'm sorry. Not at all. And so the rainy season, has finally come. The rainy season... Do you like rain? Well uh... But there's a festival this weekend. Do you have plans to take Yuji some place? Well, if it's all right with you, could I take Yuji and... Takumi? Huh? No, it's nothing. This is all set. Thank you. No problem. Who's going to the festival? - Me! - I am! I'm going to go with my mom and dad. You're not going to the festival, Yuji? Yeah. In my family, my dad... Can't go to places with so many people. I see. Please sit down. What is that? Yuji, hung it up. Yeah, Yuji put it there! It's cute. All right, class is starting. This lesson is in arithmetic. Hey, Doctor. Why can't Dad go to places with so many people? Is it a disease? Yeah, it is. You're father... well... It would be similar... To smelling gasoline fumes from being near a car. It's not a sickness in his head or in his heart. Understand? Yeah. But wouldn't your father be happy? Why? Because he has you. Yuji. I'm sorry for being late, Doctor. It's fine. Take your time. Poor Yuji. Why do you say that? Because his parent is like this. It's nothing like that. You're trying hard though everyone around you is against it. And I think you are being a very remarkable father to him. No, I am not. Not in the least. I wish I could do so many things for him. Like normal parents can. It's already been one year... Since Mio passed away. These days... Thoughts of Mio keep rising into my head. I know that... Just looking at things like pictures won't make me feel Mio but... Is that so? But... Mio said she would return. Soon. Are you talking about the rainy season return story? Yes. Having her return during the rainy season is a good wish. Yes. And Yuji believes that story as well? Yes. Do you believe? Yuji believes it. I see. I believe it cannot happen. Well, from the standpoint of science... And as a doctor... Yes. That must be so. Takumi. Yes? Would you like it if Mio returned as well? Yes. Because I couldn't make Mio happy at all. Is that so? In this condition... I only burdened Mio. From the beginning to the end. Even just for once... I wanted to make her think... That she was happy to be with me. That is why... If she does come back perhaps... I want her to have those memories. Maybe we could go on a vacation... By riding a train like normal couples. I see. Doctor. You are not asking anything about my body. Even though you're a doctor... How are you? Your symptoms? They haven't appeared. This tastes terrible. No it doesn't. It doesn't taste good. Sorry, Yuji. That's all right. I can eat it. I'm done. OK. Hey, Yuji. Want to go to the festival this Saturday? Huh? You went with Mommy before. You said it was fun, right? Still... Will you be all right, Daddy? I'll be fine. Let's go. Yeah! Yuji! Aya! Let's go over there! OK. Yuji! Yuji. Yuji! Daddy, I want to do this one. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy. Daddy. Daddy! Yuji! Daddy. Yuji. Sorry. I'm sorry. Daddy... It would've been better not to come. We shouldn't have come. Yeah. Don't cry. No matter what. Sorry. I'm sorry, Yuji. Hey Daddy. Yeah? Mommy died because of me, right? What? That's right, isn't it? Yuji, how did you hear...? Well... That's what our relatives said. No. Mommy didn't die because of you. And... I'm not going anywhere. All right? OK. I want to see Mommy. What are you looking for? A four-leaf clover. They make wishes come true. What will you wish for? To make Mommy's disease go away. Thank you. Mio... Are you all right? I'm fine. Then... Water. Water? (Word game continues) Yuji. Be careful. I'm OK! What are you looking for? It's a secret. I made a promise with Mommy. With Mommy? Yeah. But I forgot where I put it. If you search hard, you'll find it. OK. Mommy. Mio... Mommy! Mio. Are you really... Mio? Mio? Is that... My name? Mommy. Mommy? Who are you? You don't remember, Mio? You are my wife... And Yuji's mother. I am a wife? A mother? Take a look! It's me. Hey, Mommy... What's it like on the Akaibu star? Huh? Uh... Mio... You can't catch a cold, so why don't you change? I left all of your stuff as it was over here. As it was? Yeah. In any case, just change quickly. Yuji, come over here. - What? - Hurry. What? Yuji. So... For now, let's not tell anybody... That Mommy came back. Why? Because no one knows anything about the Akaibu star. So they'll all think she's a ghost. I see. Yeah. Also, it seems like Mommy doesn't remember anything. Anything about me or you... Or that she died once. How is that? Could it be because she was on the Akaibu star before coming back? How did that happen? I don't know that either! I'm sorry. Sorry. She doesn't remember anything about me. Yeah. I see. Starting today... We can help her remember everything. Everything about you and me. I have a question. Go ahead. Did I live here as the three of us? Yeah. But why is it so dirty here? Um... Was I this messy a person? No, you're not You're a neat and tidy person. Y~you were just... Sick in bed for a while so... Right? Huh? Yeah. I see. But still. This is too much. That's right It is, isn't it? What was I doing in that forest? Huh? Well... We were taking a walk. The three of us. A walk? A walk. In the middle of that, since we were tired... We were taking a small break. Yeah, we were taking a break. And during that time... I think you lost your memory. Yeah, I think that's what happened. Right? Oh... Right. You're cute. Yuji? Yeah. I am Mio. Your wife and Yuji's mother. Yes. Yes. I see. Breakfast is ready. Amazing! Is it? Here you go. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Daddy. Yeah? It's been a long time since I've had a fried egg made this well! Yeah, it has. It's a little strange. No, it's not that. Huh? You guys. No, it's not that. I'll be back later. See you later. Mio. Yes? Don't you think it would be wise not to go out? What if the same thing happens as last time? OK. Then... I'll be back later. Your shoe string... Huh? See you later. Takumi. I'll be back. Teacher! Good morning. Something incredible happened! It was amazing! Yesterday, I mean... What is it? Ah... I can't tell. What's that? Nothing happened. It did! It did! But I can't say... I'm jealous that you have a secret. It's a good thing... A secret. Good morning. Good morning. Did something good happen? Yes. What is it? It's nothing much. Oh really? Do it like this. Thank you. You're welcome. It's delicious! Really? It's great. Oh really? Yeah. Am I good at cooking? Excellent. I see. Is this me? Yeah. Then this? Takumi. Then I'll use pink... He's cute. He's your child. That's so... I gave birth to him. Yeah. We were a couple. You and I. That's right. I don't know why but I feel like I'll remember... That I'm part of a family with you and that it's true. But... I'm sorry... I still don't remember... Anything... You can do it slowly. Tell me about us. About us? Yes. How we met each other... How we fell in love... And how we lived. We first met in the spring of our junior year in high school. Then are you saying we were classmates? That's right. I was the one who liked you. Yeah, for two years we were in the same class. Coincidentally, we always... Sat next to each other. You were bright, cheerful, cute... And had good grades like a model student. But... How should I put it... You always had a part of you that was distant and hard to approach... And a defensive aura. I liked that. Yeah, I liked you. I didn't like you? I think it was a one-sided love. A one-sided love? Yeah. Because I was just an average guy. After quitting the track team, I had no interest in anything around me. I also never liked someone before. I was dejected. And because I was always an outsider. I see. Were you a good runner? Yes. I even set records in the prefecture. But at a competition during freshman year... After that, because I felt cheated... I trained myself to death every day. I became a crazed guy who only thought... About sprinting all the time. I see. You had... No reason to like a guy like that. No. You didn't even seem... To like other guys either. You didn't... Seem to have any interest in love. But... I liked that about you. I was... Happy to have even just a seat next to you. And so other than exchanging greetings... Good morning. Hello. We graduated without ever talking to each other once. Through a recommendation... I was accepted into a university close to Tokyo. You... Went to Tokyo University. Thank you. Sign mine. Sure. Here. Sure. Here. Thank you. Sure... And with that... You left for Tokyo. Hold on a second. So when does our love begin? Can you hold out just a little longer and listen a bit more? OK. During the first summer break of college... I overheard where you were working by chance. Hello? Ah... Still not yet... It'll come soon There's only a little left. OK. Hello? My name is Takumi... This is Takumi. Do you remember me? Yes. I'm sorry that I'm calling so suddenly but... Well, I never got back from you... The pen I used to sign your book on our graduation day. Would you return it? Of course it was a lie. Yes. It's a very precious pen. It was a meaningless pen but... - I really need it back. - Just for one last time... I wanted to see you. Just one more time. Takumi. Here. Thanks. I'm sorry. Such a precious pen... No problem. Thanks. It's been a while. Have you been well? Yeah. Right... Well then... Well then... Hey... Do you have time to drink a cup of coffee? I do. I think... That I had a lot of courage. But it was real. That memorable first date... Finally came true after 2 and a half years. I was really trembling. And then? And then? How should I put it? I kept on rambling like a blabbermouth. I couldn't let myself stop. If I stopped, I thought you would leave. Because I was afraid of that... I spoke about many things. Music I liked... The plot of a book I had read recently and even... That I had always kept an eye on you. Takumi. Yeah? I'm cold. If it's fine with you, you can put your hand in here. Then... Excuse me for doing this. Can I see you again? Unless I can get time off again... But... I'll write a letter. Sure. That's how we began. You and I. I'd like it if... You could be a little like you were back then. I want to feel what it felt like to like each other once more. OK. Thanks. Mommy, I'm done! Dry me off. Yuji, wash yourself up. Excuse me... Yes? You just sighed and smiled a moment ago, right? Yes. Did you meet someone beautiful? Yes. Eat up without spilling. See, I tell you all the time. You spilled too, Takumi. Huh? Hey, Aya. Yeah? You can't tell anyone. This is a deep secret. OK. (Word game involving the last syllables) Yuji, don't forget to take your umbrella. OK. Mio. Yeah? Do you think it'll be a boy or a girl? A cute baby boy. I look so happy. Pardon? You believe it? You don't believe... This is problematic. You're not the type of person to lie. And I was the one who pronounced the girl dead. You do not have to believe. I'm sorry. Please forget it. Don't worry about it. I'm sorry. However... if it's possible that what you say is true... Yes? Then when the rainy season ends... Mio will disappear. Don't you think? Yes. That is likely what would happen, right? Probably... Because Mio doesn't lie. "When the rainy season ends, it is time for me to leave..." She said that. Yuji. Yes! Why is it that no one... Comes over to visit? You're not going to go anywhere, are you Mommy? I'm not going anywhere. Dummy. What is this key? A time capsule You and I hid it... Somewhere Daddy doesn't know. I see. It's for a time capsule. But... I forgot where we hid it. Oh. I'd like to find it. Yeah. (Word game involving the last syllables of words) Perhaps, if things continue... It's all right if things continue like this and I don't get my memory back. Huh? I like you and Yuji. If I can be with the two of you like this, that's enough. If I can stay as your wife... Mio. What's the matter? Can I kiss you? Don't want to? No. What's the matter? You didn't like it? How should I put it... I'm fluttering inside. Like it's my first kiss. I see. Please check over this. Mr. Norito, this is completed as well. It appears that in the forecast... This year's rainy season will be... Much longer than normal. Great! Are you happy? Yes I'm delighted. Found it! Akaibu star? Mommy! I found it! Here's the time capsule! So this is it. Yeah. Should we open it? Daddy! Takumi! Takumi! Takumi! Are you all right? Sorry. This happens every now and then. Why didn't you tell me? That you're not in good health. I didn't want you to have any worries. Dummy. Sorry. Can I lie down next to you? Sure. Then excuse me for doing this. So... Continue the story you told me before. The story of our next date. The truth is... There wasn't a second date. Huh? We broke up once. Did something happen between us? It's because of my body. With the reckless training I began in high school... My body began to have strange symptoms. Then when I was a sophomore in college... I collapsed, being unable to move at all. From the diagnoses I got from going to many hospitals... I found out that... The motor control functions... in my brain were damaged. I gave up running. I became unable to do anything that involved large movements. I gave up everything. And I dropped out of college. Why don't you start lightly? Pardon? If you get treated with a relaxed mind, you will improve. Your disease, I mean. It's all right. You will find your happiness for sure. So you mean... That I didn't know about this? I didn't tell you. It was different from ordinary diseases. I couldn't even do half of what normal people could do. I didn't see any hope for myself. Because with me like that... I couldn't drag you into my life. And so... I decided to quietly disappear from you. Welcome. Takumi? I'm sorry for suddenly coming to you. Is something wrong? I heard you quit school. I have my reasons here and there. So I don't want to see you any more. Why? You'll find out sometime. Maybe from an alumni association or something... If I hear that you got married, I'll wish for your happiness. - I only... - Well then... I spoke harsh words. But I told myself... That this was enough. With just one date and 47 love letters... I thought that the love I had... Was completely over. But I still wanted to see you. Though I had said we should break up, I wanted to see you one more time. By that time, traveling to Tokyo alone... Was already a task too reckless for me to even imagine. But no matter what, I couldn't do nothing. No matter what, I wanted to see you. Mio! Thanks. So I wasn't the only one... who loved you. That's what I thought. I thought I had no chance. After that, I never contacted you. You didn't keep in touch either. 'Mio... Clearly feels the same. She must have forgotten everything about me'. That's what I thought. However. One day... You suddenly called. A phone call. Not a letter. Hello. Hello, Takumi? Can I come see you? Why are you making that face? But... Don't make that face. But... Because I... Said those things to you. It's not like that. You're a dummy. It's all right. We'll be all right... Us... For some reason, after you put yourself out before me... I couldn't do anything. But after hearing that... I could feel that I was alive. After that... We got married. And lived together in a village... Where Dr. Noguchi was. And then... Yuji was born. Yes. After that, the two of us... Were happy, right? Yes. We're going to be happy from now on as well. Right? I feel strangely relaxed. Best position. Best position? For some reason... Sometimes you said that while falling asleep I see. I'll be back later. See you later. Takumi. It's all right if you're late so take your time. Here, try it out You can do it slowly. You don't need to do it that hard so try it again. Here. You don't have to do it that hard. Again! It's too hard! Well there's nothing we can do about that, Yuji. Yuji! Fine. There you go. Good job, Yuji! That's how you do it! Great job! Daddy! Good morning. I made this. That's great, Yuji! Good morning. Good morning. You can't do it like this. You hold the shoulder areas properly... And then smooth it out then... Pat Pat Pat! Try it out. Smooth it out then Pat Pat Pat! Yeah, that's how you clean it. Daddy's feet are big Take a look. Here. It would be nice if this filled with blooming flowers. Yes it would. It would be very pretty... if flowers bloomed all around here. Yeah. I want to see it. Huh? Nothing. You have to grow them preciously. OK. Yuji, you learned a lot of things. Yeah. You work hard. Yeah Daddy. Yes? Mommy said that when the rainy season ends... She is going back to the Akaibu star, right? What will happen? But I think Mommy forgot all of that. But even if Mommy forgot... Someone will definitely come to take her away. All of the storybooks I read end the same way. Oh really? Then let's treasure this. Let's treasure the time we are together. OK. I'm sorry for alarming you. Y~you must be... M~Mio. Yes. Um... I'm sorry... Because I think the conversation will go long... And because I think this is problematic. Would you do me a favor? Please. Please! Yes. I understand. Thank you. There is a favor... I must ask of you, Miss Nagase. Of me? Yes. Would you please take care of Takumi and Yuji? Well if it's a favor... Lately, Takumi said he was meeting someone he liked. So... But I will go away soon. When the rainy season ends. Pardon? So... I wanted to ask someone to take care of Takumi and Yuji. Because he struggles through daily life and he is weak in many things... That's why someone... That's why I wanted to ask someone to take care of them. Can I ask this favor of you? The two of them... I'm sorry. Pardon? I'm not a great person. I'm worried about the two of them but... Because I don't want Takumi to live with someone else... Because I don't... Because I don't want him to love another person... I'm sorry I'm sorry. Please forget this. It's all right. You don't have to worry. That man has never loved me as a woman. And he never will. It was only you... Whom he ever loved. Takumi. Thank you. I'm talking with you right now, right? Yes. I heard from Takumi. You always help him out with many things even at home. I'm very grateful. It's nothing at all. It's been a long time. I'm sorry. To be quite honest, I don't remember anything about you. Huh? It was this one, right? Yes. There was something I wanted to check. Yes. What is it? Does this store... Have any plans to go out of business? Huh? Will it really be OK? Yes. We're doing fine. That's a relief. Well then, I'd like to make an order... For a birthday cake. For... Until my child turns 18. Every year. Amazing! This is incredible! Really? But of course. It's a birthday cake! This is yours. Yay! But Yuji's birthday is next week. I know. But I wanted to do this today. - All right! Let's sit. - OK. Takumi. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Yuji. Happy Birthday to you. You have to look here and smile. Mio. Will you be all right? I'm a little scared. I like you so much. I like you too. I love you. I love you too. Yuji! What's the matter? I think I should go home. Huh? I think I really have to go home. Teacher! All right. Go home. Mommy. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! For today's weather... The rainy season has finally come to an end. Takumi! Yes? It's summer. Mio! Mio! Where are you? Yuji. Listen to me well. OK? I... Have to leave. We're not parting ways forever. Yuji. Mio! Mommy, I'm sorry. Huh? You died because of me, didn't you? You dummy. How did you come to think that? That... Don't say that. It's not like that at all. You can't believe me? You... Were born after I waited and I waited. That may even be why your father and I met by chance. So we could meet you. You... Brought us good fortune. You made me happy, OK? Yuji. You must become a great person. And Daddy... Take care of him. You're not going to see Daddy? Yeah. Probably not. I think the time has come. You can't yet. Daddy hasn't come yet. Because he runs slowly. But Yuji... Your father... Used to run frighteningly fast. He really liked strength. Mio! I can't find any! There aren't any! Mio! Daddy! Mio! You made it in time. I like it. Mio. Yes. I'm sorry. You made me so happy but... I... Couldn't make you happy so... I'm sorry. What are you talking about? You and Yuji look so much alike. I was happy. I was always happy. Ever since I started liking you, I always have. My happiness... Is you. Being by your side... Was my happiness. If it was possible... I would have always been by your side forever. Yuji... Please take care of him. Love him in my place. Takumi... I'm cold. Thank you. I really loved the time I spent with you. Found it! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy... Mommy! Mommy! Is that so? Yes. She returned with the rainy season. And she left with the rainy season. She is a person full of love. Doctor, do you really believe my story? Well, what should I do? But I... Was able to love Mio again. We were happy. There won't be another person in this world... Who will have the same experience. Because you met her, it will shine brightly for sure. Time and time again. You were able to be with each other. The one true love. June 24th. Today I discovered someone I like. Um... Excuse me. Why is that? Why is my head only filled with thoughts of him? Maybe I'm falling in love. Sophomore, Class 3, Student Number 1. Takumi Aio. Go! That was clearly cheating. I can't convince them. But he didn't even get mad... So why did I do that? For sure, I think I like him. But he doesn't have any idea about how I feel. He's a little thick-headed but I have a one-sided love. Through my power as a member of the class council, I barely got a seat next to him. I couldn't tell him about my love. But... I was happy to just have a seat next to him. Even with that... I was happy. Takumi, I want to know about you. What book are you reading? What music do you like? What color do you like? What kind... of girl do you like? There's no reason you would like me. Nothing has started and soon it will be time for farewells. What can I do? What should I do? I'm sorry. Sign mine. I could have returned it to him right then. But... I didn't go. If I hold onto it, I'll be able to see him one more time. Because if he calls me asking me to return it, I can meet him. I can call him. "Please come get your pen", That's all I have to say. But... I didn't have the courage to do that. No, not at all I'm sorry... such a precious pen... I think I remember. He called me... Asking me to return it. I can see him. This is a pen that brings the heart. Here. Thanks. It's been a while Have you been well? Yeah. Right... Well then... Well then... It won't work for a fool like me. I wanted to meet him that badly but I'm just turning away like this? Am I all right with that? Hey... Do you have time to drink a cup of coffee? I do. I already read this book over 3 times. You kept on non-stop... Like a blabbermouth. I couldn't say anything. But I was really happy because I could be by your side I wish this time could keep coming again and again. Your hand was really warm. But spring came and I received a letter from you. It was only 3 lines. Why? Let's meet again sometime. Maybe from an alumni association or something... If I hear that you got married, I'll wish for your happiness. - I just... - Well then... My happiness was being by your side. I want to be by your side always but... That's all I want but... Are we really ending things like this? I really want to see you again. I sincerely do. I want to see you more than anything. Takumi? I'm sorry. Takumi! Takumi! Takumi! Takumi! Takumi! Takumi... Takumi... Mommy! Mio. Good morning. Good morning I'm sure no one would believe me if I told them. Because it's still hard for me to believe as well. I, at 20 years old, met you at 29 years old... And we fell in love and parted ways. I jumped into the future. To the rainy season 9 years later, I had become your wife. And between us, we had a cute child named Yuji. I was happy. It was a happy experience. I want to be in love with you once more. But I figured it out. That the real me died one year ago... I will die at 28 years old. Leaving my loving Takumi and Yuji behind. I'm going to die. With only the promise that I will return in one year during the rainy season. Takumi. Takumi. Perhaps if I had not met you... I would have become someone else's wife and led a different life. I may not even have a future where I die when I am 28. But I don't want it. Because I love you. Because I know the future with you. After meeting you, and becoming your wife... I want to watch the life of a child named Yuji. I want to let Yuji be born into this world. No matter what, I want to do it. Hello? Takumi? Can I come see you? Even if it's for a short time... I want a future with... The ones I love. Takumi... Takumi... Yuji... Please wait for me. Now, I'm going to be with you. Why are you making that face? But... Don't make that face. But I... Said all those things to you. It's not that. You dummy. It's all right. We'll be all right. I'm going to stay with you. That's what I decided. Decided? Yeah. Because you're my only love. I love you. Dad. Yeah? Wanna get started? Sure. It's your birthday so is curry enough? It's fine because I like the curry you make. Here. Huh? Have you grown taller? Turn around. Back to me. - You can't lift your heels. - I'm not!
