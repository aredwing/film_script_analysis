Today, I've family in Mumbai. Wife Madhu! And my daughter Charu! After lots of struggle today I can say we're que settled. But the life let anyone settle? I had imagined that .. Clearly .. everyone has a defined role in life. But I was wrong. Sometimes, life brings you to a crossroad .. Passe .. where it Difficult to decide who's your daughter .. And .. who's .. mother. Once again you're late today. - Sorry. I can not tolerate your daily drama .. - Sorry. Hold this! Quick! Take out juice for Charu. And give it to her. - Yes Once again I'm going to get late today. Mr. Journalist. Will you please take your breakfast? Yes, Madhu queen! This is what you want. That I Should resign and be your kitchen queen. Correct? - Yes, madam. I do so wish but if you mind .. .. Then I'm ready to be a househusband. - I see. Who will pay the half EMI? Finance minister of the country? Good point! - "Munni defame accepted for your sake, darling." Charu, stop singing. - "Munni accepted defame .." Come and take your breakfast. - ".. For your sake, darling." ".. For your sake, darling." If my Munni will sing so bad, naturally she'd defame. But Pope says, I'm a born singer. Right, papa? - Absolutely, darling. Is it? So, tell me what's 'sargam' (melody)? Rishi Kapoor's film. Fantastic! He's giving you the title of singer born? Worry not, my child. Mamma is jealous. Madam! Madam! today evening I want to leave early. Hold this. For now, I've had to leave in a hurry. C'mon, let's go. Wow! How do you manage this, Madhu? It's easy, sir. - No! You're a genius. You'll definitely progress in life. For now, I'd go to my seat. For sure. Yes - Here's our lunch. C'mon, guys. Have pizza. - Okay, I'll call you later. Let's eat! - Madam Joshi! Madam Joshi! Someone wants to see you. - Take your piece. I'll just come in a minute. - Yeah! Your piece. Munna! How are you? How come you're here? I'm fine, sis (sister). Did you take your lunch? - No, I was about to take it. We've ordered pizza. Will you eat? I wanted to speak something in private. Shall we go out times? - Come! Sis, there's the good news. Why? One son was not enough? Not that good news, sis. I'm going to U.S. on behalf of the company. Wow! Brilliant! I'm so proud of you, Munna. Thank you, sis. - For how many days? For 3 years. With family. Company is providing accommodation to the family. Great! Mother will visit us at this age. I've seen an accommodation. Single rooms, personal attendants. Full five star luxury. Superb! - For May (mother). Meaning? Old age home? Are you not taking mother along? No, sis. It's not like that. Then what is it, Munna? You're not taking away Mai Look, there's LCD TV, AC. I also Told Them to paint Mai's favorite color. You're not taking away Mai There'll be people of her age over there. Moreover, she'll get bored with us. You're not taking away Mai I can not help it, sis. This is once in a lifetime opportunity for me. You know May is not medically fit. Medical is too costly in U.S.. And her amnesia. Twice, I've taken her to Dr. Mehta. Anyways, people in U.S., leave Their parents in old age home. This is not U.S.. - Okay, fine. I've the options. What do we do now? Tomorrow, we'll talk to Anita and Radhika and then decide. Check! What are you saying, Munna? Can anyone leave his parents in old age home? Did Mai orphanage to drop us .. After father's death ..? She toiled hard and Suffered alone. Still she raised us. Living in small room, Mai's did other chores .. Made each of us .. independent .. .. And got us married. Had it not been Mai. .. You'd not even be able to travel across the city today. Remember her sacrifices .. .. For your education in Ingls medium school. Sis Anita, try to understand .. - Listen to me. Even I've my parents-in-law at home. And we live in 1 BHK. Still Rahul and I never thought like this. Son has to take parent's responsibility, right? And anyways, you were Mai's favorite.
