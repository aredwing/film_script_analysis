The two most important agencies were the "Eastern Agency" and "Imperial Guards". These are the Imperial Guards. And these are the Eastern Agency special agents, called "Fan Zi". They are very cruel individuals. People are terrified of their infamy. This is their second-in-command, Mao Zong Xian. This is their first-in-command, Pi Shao Tang. Highly trained in the skill of martial arts, they commit ruthless acts. Their commanding officer is Zhao Shao Qin. A powerful man and a highly skilled swordsman. His martial skills are at their peak. He rules his government officials by instilling fear. Minister of Defence, Yu Qian, was made Chief of Executions. He has been framed by these dirty beasts and is due to be executed for treason. His children will be exiled to the distant frontier outpost of Dragon Gate. DRAGON INN Executive Producer Jung-feng Sha Producer LS Chang Starring: Lingfeng Shangguan, Chun Shih, Ying Bai Music by Lau-Ping Chow Written and Directed by King Hu Look, Yu's spirit will not die that easily. Send his children to the outposts or they'll be a threat. Your Excellency, you have such foresight. Cut the grass and rip out the roots, never let it grow again. - They're coming! - You go on ahead. Halt! Stop! Step aside! Move, move! Go! Officer, hurry and run. - Who are you? - Quickly! Your Excellency. What's the matter? Oh? They're planning to attack us? They can't get too far, we can catch them. No, better to wait for them at the Dragon Inn. - Look! - What is it? Over there! Call the boss. Boss! Boss! - What is it? - Your guests have arrived. - Guests? - Over there. - Help with their luggage. - Yes, sir. You're leaving now? Do come back again. Strange that there are travellers in this season. Good day, sir. Let us help with your baggage. Welcome, everyone. Please come in. This way. Hurry, bring water! Make some tea! Please come in. Please take a seat. Would you prefer an upstairs room? Good day, sir. The boss is out of town, so I will be at your service. - What is your position here? - I'm in charge of accounting. How many people checked in today? No one. Who'd come here in this season? Good. We will reserve the whole inn. The whole inn? We'll be staying for five to ten days. No other guests are allowed. Understood? I understand, sir, but... - Settle the rooms for everyone. - Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir, could you tip us for carrying the luggage? You, wait over there. Let me prepare you more tea. Boy! - Bring me a glass of water. - Yes, sir. How much? Whatever, sir. We've carried them for miles... Very well. How many soldiers are there at the post? - I'm not sure. - Speak! About 12 men. You, take care of it. We will use this place to settle some official business. You must ask my permission before you accept any more guests. Understand? Yes, I understand. Hold a funeral for these men. And bring me some tea. You wait on the road, I'll flush them out. - Meet at the bottom of the hill. - Yes, sir. Keep some guards at the inn too. Apologies, sir, but we are full. - I don't need a room. - Then what do you require, sir? Where's the owner, Mr Wu? - He's out of town on business. - I see. When will he be back? I'm not sure, sir. Perhaps you should come back another time. - No, I'll wait until he returns. - Oh... I think it would be better to leave. Oh? Why? Because, er... Because, erm... Well, sir... It's not safe around here due to the Tartars. - The Tartar soldiers would attack us? - Oh, yes, yes. Don't worry, they don't frighten me. Hey, you lot, carry on playing. All our rooms are full, so you'd better... You already told me that. Here will do just fine. Bring me a bowl of lamb, noodle soup and some wine. You should... Bring lamb, noodle soup and wine. Hey, boy! Bring me what he's having. Wait. I want the one on that gentleman's table. Eh? That one there. I can bring you a fresh bowl. Stop! I want his bowl. Is that clear? Er... sure, I understand, but... - Let him eat first. - Thank you, sir. Take it! Please. Go and check if my wine's ready, would you? - Take that to him. - Eh? But... Take it! Sir, your wine is... What? Your wine... No, no, no! What is it? - The wine... - What about it? I spilt some. Sorry, sir. What's wrong? What's the matter with you? Sit down. Quickly, find me a rope. Get out of here. Move it! I said step aside! - You dare try to poison me? - No, no, I didn't! - Oh, no? Then you drink it. - No, I don't drink! Drink it! Step back! You dogs! How dare you? We're well known around here. Boy, bring a clean flask of wine. Hey, what's your purpose here? May I borrow this towel? Hey, I'm talking to you! Pick up this stuff first. Why are you just standing there? Bring the wine here. - What happened? - Hold it! Don't forget your weapon! Don't move, otherwise you will die. This is bad, sir! Cook me another bowl of noodles. - You still want to eat? - Don't talk, just go and cook. - Sir, you've made a big mistake. - How so? They have about a dozen men. They'll be back soon. Never mind. They won't dare fool with me. - I'll go and investigate. - Wait. Watch this fellow, be careful. You killed this man? - Why? - He didn't tell you? - He did. - Then there's no need to ask me. That's his version, I want to hear yours. How's he related? I'm a friend. Well, since you're his friend, I'll tell you. He put poison in my wine. So you killed him. Do you have any proof it was him who poisoned your wine? My word is proof enough. His life was precious. What do you plan to do about that? Like what? You killed him, so you must pay with your life. Very well. You can report me to the authorities. I have no time for the authorities. I doubt they could handle me. You'll also have to explain the deaths of those workers. There's no need! I think we should forget this ever happened. Forget it? It's not that easy. And why not? You're an unreasonable man! So? Move! How many times do I have to tell you, don't fool around? You're no better than dogs! Quick, bring some water! - Impressive, very impressive. - Thank you. - Please overlook this incident. - Of course. How should I address you? Xiao Shao Zi. Brother Xiao... - What do you do for a living? - Not much. If someone offers to feed me... I stay and help out for a while, but not for too long. Forgive my rudeness, but what is your purpose here? Oh, the owner here, Mr Wu, is my friend. What is it that you do? I work for the Ministry of Justice. I fool around all day with these monkeys! So you're here on some case? No choice. I take their money, so I must fulfil my job. Maybe in the future, I could call on your help? You're too kind. So what case are you working on? Brother Xiao, don't take this personally, but my profession doesn't allow me to speak openly. I fully understand. We were sent from the capital by secret imperial order. The commander told us to keep people away from the crime scene. I understand. You mean I should leave now? Not at all. But if you help me, I will be very grateful. There's no need for that. - I can pay your travelling expenses. - No need. But I'll visit again when Mr Wu returns. Of course. Many thanks. - Boss? - Yes? - How much is it? - On the house! Allow me. - Thank you. - See you then. Farewell. Please return this to that fellow. - Farewell. - Farewell. Send two men to follow him. Elder brother! Shao Zi! You're here at last. - I've already been at your inn. - Why didn't you wait for me? There's an imperial officer there on a special assignment. He told me I should leave. What? I don't believe him. Also, his men have no uniforms. Wait a moment. Who do you think they are? They seem brutish and they know how to fight. Why did you ask me to come? Let's go back to the inn. Sir, Xiao is coming back. Hide this away. We must be careful what we say. We're not from the Eastern Agency but the Ministry of Justice. Go and tell the others, hurry. - Go and tell the guards. - Yes, sir. What a surprise. - Back so soon, Xiao? - I met Brother Wu outside. This is the officer from the Ministry of Justice. - Wu Ming. - Ah, the innkeeper Wu Ming. Please excuse me if my staff haven't served you well enough. - No, everything's fine. - Mr Wu... I'm Mao Zong Xian. We have ministry business to attend to here. All we require is that you serve our needs here, nothing more. Until we finish our job, nobody is allowed to leave here. Do I make myself clear? And no new guests staying without our approval. Yes, yes... Stop! What do you want? Run! Wait, Brother! Let's follow them with stealth. Let's go on to the inn. - What is it? - We want a room. Open up! Open the door! Open up! Open the door! We have no vacant rooms, sorry. Who's in charge? - Me, sir. - Why wouldn't you open the door? Apologies, my men have no manners, but we're full. - Then we'll sleep on the floor! - You can't do that... Stop! There's no need for violence, is there? - So what? - I'm asking you. It's none of your business! We'll do it the hard way. Stop it, Big Brother! We shall sleep here! There's no need to sleep on the floor. You may have my room. - We couldn't possibly accept that. - We must help each other. - And who is that? - A businessman. Let's all eat now! Eat well, everyone. So tell us... why are you in this desert region? We're heading for Guangzhou, to meet some relatives. And what is your business here? The Ministry of Justice sent us to apprehend two escaped criminals. Sounds like a hard job. To your health! Have you seen a group escorting convicts? A man, a woman and a child? We've seen a few escorts. Maybe you know their names and destination? Their surname is Xiang, they're distant relatives of ours. Never heard the name. Have you? Never heard of them. Cheers! This wine's not very good. See if you can get something better. The wine is poisoned. Please excuse me for my behaviour before. Allow me to propose a toast to you. Fine, let's just forget what happened. Cheers! Thank you. WINE IS POISONED - More hot wine? - Thank you. So, to our health. Cheers! - Careful! - You've had enough to drink. - Who, me? - Brother, you're drunk. Don't worry about spilling the wine. I have a fresh flask. To your health! - What the...? - You ought to stop drinking. Eat something, or else you'll starve to death. I won't starve! Mother told me to look after you, and not let you drink too much. The wine's very strong. It's not good for you. Sorry, but I'm not permitted to drink. Why don't you drink with us then? Sure. Cheers! You've spilt it. Allow me to offer you my cup. I've spilt mine too. Would you pass me your cup? Why do you want mine? Surely it doesn't matter? It matters to me! What's the matter with you? Pour again. - I want your cup. - What's so special about my cup? If you keep refusing me, there'll be trouble! Enough. Pass over your cup. Stay out of it, Brother! That's no way to drink wine. Stop it now. Sorry, but my man here is drunk. Officer Mao, he tried to kill me. Stop it. We're aware of your skills already! I think they may have something to do with the beheaded Yu Qian. I think Xiao is the most dangerous one. He told those two that the wine was poisoned. - When? - When he proposed a toast to you. - How did he do it? - No idea. - But they're all connected somehow. - All four of them? The innkeeper too. Then they must all die. Xiao is a dangerous fellow. We'll play a trick on them. I don't like that Xiao. If it wasn't for him, we'd be dead by now. Why should he save our lives? - You sleep over there tonight. - On the floor? Playing some kind of trick again, eh? - We should start. - Yes. Let me just explain... Don't act rashly! A woman? What happened? Officer Mao, did you hear any noise? No. Come to my room. - Who is it? - The innkeeper. Oh, it's you. What happened here? No idea. - I have some idea. - If you have something to say, say it! How dare you talk to me like that? All your mouthing off and fighting! Without your sister, you'd be long dead. One day you'll learn! - Why, how dare you...? - Stop it! - You want to fight again? - He's just short-tempered. He was traumatised as a child. And he hasn't changed a bit since then! You know my brother? Yes. No wonder he doesn't recognise me. Last time he saw me, he was a child. Who are you? Wu Ming. You're an officer from Yu Qian's troop? Your father and I were in the same unit. Uncle Wu! The years have flown by... Stand up. Come to my room later. Brother Wu, how did you know they were from the Eastern Agency? I know these people. They're here because of Yu's family, I'm sure. Uncle Wu, what shall we do now? Wait till they're asleep, then slaughter them all. Yu's family are due to arrive here tomorrow. At dawn, we should go out to look for them. After we've found them, we'll kill the agents. They may be looking for them too. It's a risk we'll have to take. We'll search in different directions. Then we'll have to disappear very quietly. Search him. EASTERN AGENCY ORDERS: "ANNIHILATE THE YU FAMILY." If anything should happen, send someone to find me. Hey, when they get here, I will... Just be careful. Lao San, they're here! Go and warn the others straightaway. Innkeeper, are there any vacant rooms? Rooms? Yes, we have some. Get us something to eat. Bring some water, tea and food. Hurry! Please be seated. Some water, sir. - How long will you be staying, sir? - Just till tomorrow morning. That's good. Go. It looks like they've arrived. Go back and save them now. If it's too late, take them to the grain storage. I will find Xiao. Hey, this way! We must leave now! What's going on? Quickly, we must leave. Attack! To the grain storage! You can't escape! Get them. You head to the grain storage. And you attack from the front. Make way! Let bygones be bygones, shall we? Very well. If you let the Yu family go free. Fine. Go inside. Bring the Yu family here. I'll deal with this. Miss Yu! Get to the grain storage and try to get inside from the rear. - And you? - I'll hold them off here. - Brother Xiao... - Yes? - Xiao? - Who is it? Pi Shao Tang. Would you step outside? Why did you call for me? Xiao, look over there. You summoned me to show me this? I don't think my men deserve this. You don't think so? They should have learned their lesson by now. You're no relative of the Yu family. Why are you so determined to fight? I have no choice. And I get paid, after all. If that is the case, money's no issue. Once I've taken sides, there is no turning back for me. But why? You can always change sides. - Sorry, but that is impossible. - Why so? This isn't about honour and money. It's about the family of a great man. And also... don't be enraged at this... your agents aren't exactly the most popular. Don't try to flatter me. I know all this myself. But we do pay our men very well. What do you mean by "well"? It depends on the services rendered to us. I believe you have seen what kind of service I can provide. Then perhaps you will accept my offer? Perhaps. We usually pay 100 taels. I'll offer you double. That's just not enough. - Xiao, name your price. - 200 pieces of gold. Very well, I will pay 200 in gold. Payment right now. Now you're pushing me too far! - What's the meaning of this? - You want to rip me off? Hold him off. Move aside. If you insist on disturbing me, you'll make me angry. Get them away from here! You must rest. Don't waste medicine on him! Be quiet! He'll be all right. Let him go. You may leave now. - Don't let them go! - Be still now. Hey, they'll be coming back for us! Silence! You must leave now. Carry on. Thank you so much. But what can we say...? Don't drink too much water. On your way now. They're unconscious. Master Wu, may I talk with you? - Don't listen to him! - Enough! Go on. Master Wu... - We don't want to go back. - Oh? And why is that? If you have no objections... we would like to follow you. You wouldn't have a bright future with us. If we go back, we won't have one, either. Every day, committing evil deeds, killing innocent people... sooner or later, one comes to regret it. - What's your name? - Duo La. What? My name's Duo La. We're Tartars. He's my brother. We always admired Chinese culture when we lived at home. I always wanted to go to China. When I was 18, General Yu assembled his new troops. And he marched his way to China. Who would've thought that...? So you know me? Who doesn't know Lieutenant Wu from General Yu's army? How come you work for the Eastern Agency? Just shortly before General Yu was convicted, I was transferred to the Royal Guards. After the execution, I paid my respects at Yu's grave. Zhao heard of this and transferred us to the Eastern Agency. We had no choice in the matter. And so you became agents. Can you tell them to leave us alone for a moment? Zhao Shao Shin had me and my brother... sterilised. I assume they won't be here for two days. You said that Zhao had taken his fighting skills to new heights. What did you mean by that? I don't know, they just say that his skill is unmatched. But he suffers from asthma and mustn't overdo it. Xiao, let's get him. Isn't that enough to match him? - He's even faster than you two. - Really? Then show us your skill. They're coming. Open up! - Who is it? - Wu Ming, it's Gui Yu Xiang! Lieutenant Gui, welcome! You can come out. He's a friend. Forward! - Where are my twelve soldiers? - The Agency men killed them. And why did they do that? They wanted to kill Yu's children, and your men were in the way. Wu Ming, we are friends... but don't act so rashly! Arrest him! We'll talk later. Out of my way! Are you resisting? Drop your weapon! I bow to Your Excellency. You're to blame for all this. I have failed, but Xiao's too skilful a fighter. Weakling! Just look at yourself! Yes, sir. Wait! I heard that the innkeeper's name is Wu. Yes, sir. Is it Wu Ming? THE CHILDREN OF YU MUST DIE EVERYONE OFFERING THEM AID WILL BE KILLED TOO He must be in the vicinity. That damn eunuch! I will talk to him. Your job is to watch the border. This is none of your business. Stay out of it or you'll find yourself in trouble. But this is my territory! East Agency eunuchs have no jurisdiction here! How dare you? A low-ranking officer like you speaking like that to me? You're dismissed! Very well. - Show me the Royal Order. - Bring the order and show it to him. Your Excellency, come and look at this. Step aside! I CAN'T MEET YOU NOW. TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH. WU MING. That's a good escape route. Let me. Stay back! Duo La... cover me. Go back and tell His Excellency that we've got them. He's wounded. Let's finish him. Traitors! You cover our backs, we'll go up front! They've got us surrounded. There's no way out. Zhao and his men are in supremacy. We must fight now. What about the others? You stay here. We will try to get to Zhao. I'll go with you. You might need help in the fight. No, you'd better watch over them. You know you'll be in great danger. If I'm not back by dawn, try to get away with the others. Tell me where Zhao is and you'll live. Where is Zhao? Talk! - Talk! - He's there! You will go to Zhao and tell him that I want to speak to him. Go! Oh? And where are they now? Out there. - Tell them to come in. - Yes, sir. By order of His Excellency Zhao, Xiao shall enter the house! No stupid formalities! Tell him to come out now! His Excellency! Which of you is Xiao? That's me. You're very impertinent. I have to be. I heard you're a skilful fighter. Skilful enough. You don't look anything like it. - You don't look like a eunuch, either. - How dare you! Don't try to scare me. I'm not one of your agents! I'll make you an offer. Just leave the children here, and you are free to walk away from this place. If you follow me, I'll offer you an officer's commission. And if I don't? Then you shall suffer. You're good, old man. Such a technique is learned from childhood. And he's never tasted sensual pleasure! But that was never a problem for you. You never had any senses to enjoy. Am I right? Take a few men and search for the children. Now that was close! Almost close enough to make me a eunuch like you! Get back! Eunuch Zhao, as you don't have anything below, better take care of the upper half! Eunuch Zhao, you're too old for this stuff!
