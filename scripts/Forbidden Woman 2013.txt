That's a job for a man and a man only. (chuckling) What kind of man jumps into the backseat and screams like a baby for no reason? What... For no reason? For no reason? You almost ran three cars off the road and when I asked you to turn for Starbucks coffee you almost spun a 360. Man, look, you are not a stunt driver, Sheila. I shouldn't have had to call your mama to talk you out of that backseat, Jarvis... that just ain't right. What... this ain't right. No, hey, you know what? I thought you were going to keep that between us. Well, I didn't say that you had to make her sing to you to calm you down. You know what, I've reached my point. I've reached my boiling point. My whole life flashed before my eyes. - (phone ringing) - It must have been a long flash - 'cause you older than dirt. - Oh, oh, I'm older than dirt. I'm young where it counts. Hey, Charles... shh! (laughing) I'm glad you could get a few seconds to get away. Oh, yes, yes! I love the purse. It arrived yesterday. Oh, you know it. (chuckling) Yeah, I know... (chuckling) Oh, no, no, no. No, I won't call you on this line any more. But you call me when you can, okay. Okay, mwah, I miss... I miss... (chuckling) Disconnect, huh, dial tone, huh? You are never gonna learn, you know that? One of these days, one of these wives of these married men you've been running around with will make a story out of you on the 6:00 news. I can see it right now. "Famous jump-off gets knocked off." Back to you, Jim. Just shut up. You just jealous 'cause your woman got you wrapped around her little finger. When she say jump, you jump! At least I'm jumping in my own house. When these married men jump off of you they jump right back to their wives 'cause you're like the famous trampoline of Chicago. Yeah, I said it. Hello, that's right. Look, I'm just out here trying to get all the nice things that I deserve, okay? Rather than be unhappy like you. - At least I don't pretend. - You don't pretend? Every day you pretend. You walk around here all uppity, your nose so far in the air, your feet don't touch the ground. This a old-fashioned home wrecker, all right? You know, my grandmother, she had a word for it. It's a photograph word, they called it a "Jezebel" spirit. You're just mad 'cause I wouldn't be caught dead with a junior attorney like you. Yeah, I'll be a junior, and you can be a Jezebel. How 'bout that for the time being? Man: Good morning, everybody. Isn't it a glorious morning, I must say. Are we getting a raise? You know, since you're always pretending to be working I'm going to pretend you didn't ask me that. - Amen, Brother. - Praise the Lord. We need to make sure our files are in order for the Simon and Stevens presentation. You know... that's exactly why I love having you as a part of this firm. You always do the things that are important. You know, with this merger Simon and Stevens... it's gonna do a lot for this firm. Yes, it is. You know, um... my daddy started this firm with a thousand-dollar loan from our great-great grandfather, who was a slave hand in Mississippi. He built this firm from nothing. And just to think, pretty soon, we're gonna merge with one of the biggest firms in the state. And you know what? I'm gonna need a VP of Operations. I'm thinking... ...corner office. - Mmm. - A bonus... - Mm-hmm. ...and a company car. You know what I mean? Yes, sir, I know exactly what you mean. Fool, you ain't going nowhere. You gonna be right here with me in the cheap seats. (laughing) You know, I am very fortunate. I don't mean to brag or boast but I have a beautiful home, a wonderful job, and a fantastic wife. Fantastic. - Did... did I say fantastic? - You did. 'Cause I mean fantastic. I mean, oh so fantastic! Oh, that's good 'cause you ain't no spring chicken. - Sheila! - What? What's wrong with saying the truth around here? Goodness. Well, boss, I am here for whatever you need. You know what? I'm finally looking forward to meeting that lucky lady of yours. - Fantastic. - Yeah. Listen, she's on her way and when she gets here, will you tell her that I'll be in my office, working on those merger papers? - We are on our way, son. - We're on our way, boss. Ooh! Did I hear him say VP maybe? - Uh, yes, you did. - No way. Pretty soon, I'm about to be ballin', out of control. Yeah! Yeah, man, you could use that, man. After the year you just had. I mean, with the nasty breakup and your mother passing away. That was pretty hard on everybody, you know? - Yeah... - You deserve it. You know, she broke up with me a week after they told me my mother had cancer. Who would do something like that? Whoo, man, that's cold-blooded. But she did have some nice legs. - I'm just saying. - Come on, man. I've been so down and depressed, man, I could use some good news. You know what, you... you deserve some good news. I gave that woman everything I had. Just out of curiosity, just tell me, how much did you have? Huh, wouldn't you like to know? Yeah, you know what, I'm glad to see you finally out of the house, man. For a minute, I was kind of worried about you for a second. You know, to think that, uh... through all the pain, all the hard work and dedication, - finally gonna pay off. - Mmm, that's right. Studying all those long law hours, drawing up contracts and licenses, getting Randall's laundry. Well, actually you had me getting his laundry... And to think, just ten years ago, I was scraping up money to buy noodles. We... we were scraping up money to buy noodles... And now... I'm in a position to be VP of the biggest firm in the state. I'm about to be the man! You about to be the man, we about to be... We about to blow up! Woman: Hello, everyone. I'm Vanessa, Vanessa Young. My friends call my Vanny, but you guys can call me... Vanessa. Oh, Vanessa. Well, how you doing, Vanessa? I'm Jarvis, nice to meet you, it's a pleasure. That's funny. Randall has never mentioned you before. That's because he's just a junior attorney. Hi, I'm Sheila, I do all the secretarial work around here. Sheila, yeah, your reputation precedes you. I'm watching you. Oh... And you must be Elston. Randall rants and raves about you. How intelligent and dedicated you are. Are you dedicated to my husband, Elston? Absolutely. Oh, my goodness, there's my little love bug. - How you doing? - Good. It's good to see you. Uh, everybody... ...you met my wife, Vanny. - Yes. - I guess. I can't believe you never mentioned my name once. - Not once. - Whatever, whatever. I don't mean to brag, but I just want you all to know she is the ultimate love of my life. Oh, you don't need to pour it on... You have transformed me into everything I am right now. And you've made me whole again. You already got me, Randall. - Stop it. - Yeah, he got you... right out of the cradle. So are you working late tonight? Um, Vanny, I wanted to, um... I wanted to talk to you about that. Um, you know with this big deal next week I'm gonna be burning the midnight oil, so... I mean, is there something you wanted that we can talk about? No, just ever since you came close to making this deal, I've just been restless. I've been at home, lonely. We used to have more fun than this. I know, I know, but as soon as this merger goes through, I'll have a lot of time on my hands and we can pick up right where we left off. Yeah, you picked up right from the school playground. Sheila, would you... Vanny, listen, why don't you take the credit card and go down to that little boutique that you like and do a little shopping, buy whatever you want. Whatever? Mm-hmm, if you need my administrative skills while you're down there, I'm available. Hey... I love you. It was nice meeting everyone. And I'm watching you. ## That... ...is one gorgeous woman. You know, I can't believe he didn't mention my name not once. Don't I do a lot around here? Not even a little bit of, you know, "Hey, Jarvis, I like the way you made the coffee, man." Prepping my sugar... nothing. I get no respect. Sheila, I'm telling you right now. See. ## I see how you watch TV. You flip the channel every second. Oh, come on, man, you know I'm just a junior attorney. You know, ain't got this kind of cable at my house, can't afford it, so I got to watch every station I can. - Yeah, speaking of your house. - Uh-huh. When you going home? Go home? Oh, come on, man. You know you miss your boy. Come on, we just hanging. I been at work with you all day, man, why you getting weird? What... weird? Of course not, I'm not getting weird. I just, you know, like hanging with my dog, my homey, you know what I'm saying? Just kicking it with my boy. You know, rolling with the homey. - What did you do, man? - Huh? What did you do? What... Okay, all right, look. I stayed an extra half an hour at the sports bar. Now she looking for me, I'm scared. Man, come on, dude, you gotta help me, dog. Call the police... no, better yet, call my mom. Why don't you put your foot down, man? - Put my foot... - Raven will respect you more once you take up for yourself. - Really, put my foot down? - Yes. Last time I put my foot down, she put that foot in my mouth and wrapped my own leg around my neck. I'm telling you, this woman is a serial killer. I'm not talking Cocoa Puffs. I got the solution, perfect solution. Can I live with you? Oh no, oh no, you ain't bringing that foolishness in my house. - No, sir. - Come on, man. Look, you think I could suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome? 'Cause, like, I be sitting at my desk, I be, like, twitching. I be, like, scared, my bowels ain't moving in weeks. It's weird, dude, I'm... something's wrong, dude. I'm having nightmares, nightmares. - Nightmares? - Yes. In the day? Yes, tell me that ain't crazy. Nightmares during the day, that's me, that's how I live. - Know what you need to do? - What? You need to chill, okay. - "Woosah," breathe. - Just breathe? Breathe it out, bro, you're gonna be fine. I read that somewhere, just breathe. - Yes. - Okay, yeah. You know, who used to really help me breathe? - Who? - Yvette. Yeah, Yvette, I'll tell ya, she really knew how to calm me down - when I used to feel like this. - Come on, man. Don't go there. You broke up with her three years ago so stop it, all right? Look, I mean, three years, it's been a long time, man. - Stop it, man, stop it. - She was the love of my life, dude. You just mad at me now because I'm, you know... I used to date your sister. You said it was cool, E. No, you told me I had to go through with it, okay? These situations are kind of awkward. These breakups where it's my best friend and my sister, you know? Nobody could treat me like Yvette. I mean, she was... I mean, she was cool, I mean... I loved nobody like her. That's right. You know, she just need her space, that's all, you know. You know what, speaking of space, - I need my space, okay? - Yeah. Now I'm not saying you gotta go home, bro, but it's about that time. I need to unwind a little bit, you know, kind of just... air out, so... - What, just like that? - I'll see you at work tomorrow. Just 'cause I started talking about your sister and everything, reminiscing, now you gotta kick me out like that, - that's how we go? - Nothing personal... That's how we do it? - We brothers? - Let me have mine. All right, okay, see, now my face leaking. You see this, you see this? Now... now... now all my stuff is coming loose. I'm gonna go grab some tissue. You be good, all right? You're a hot mess, you're a hot mess. I'm gonna get some tissue, man. (weeping) Oh, whoo, these emotions. Whoo, all right, I gotta... get it together, man, get it together, get it tog... Look... what do we have here? Antidepressants? Oh, come on, Elston, you can't go out like that. - Where he at?! - (door slamming) Well, hello, Raven. I know that fool up in here. I ain't worried about you, boy. Where the hell is he at? Elston: I don't know if I wanna tell you. You know what, I told that fool to be home when I get home. You know, if I step in that door and he's not there, well, let's just say, he's humping for a thumping. Itching for a whipping. Jarvis, my candy jar! Where the hell you at? Lord, Lord, Father... please, please save me from this crazy, crazy, crazy woman. Please, I know you created her but she is... Don't make me miss "Housewives." Baby, sweetheart, dumpling, honey pie, sugarfoot. Um, funny thing had happened. I stayed late at the cantina because I had a bad burrito and I was stuck in the bathroom. Yeah, stuck in the bathroom. So, uh, you don't have to be mad, okay, don't harm me. Un-uh. I eat them burritos all the time. They ain't never did nothing to me. Well, there was that one time, but... It was too many damn people on that bus anyway. You cleaned out the entire bus station, Raven, come on. Boy, shut your mouth. Look here. I am going to the store for a few things. You better be outside when I get back. And I mean at attention. Jarvis, I ain't got all night. - Can you pick me up something... - Hell no. - (door closing) - (sighing) You can come out now, bro. You sure? Yeah, it's safe, come out. - You sure she gone? - Man, put the vase down. Man, I'm telling you, man, I can't deal with this messy violent stuff. I'm telling you, man, I'm a man, dude. - You're pathetic. - I'm pathetic? - Yeah. - Whatever, dude... shoot. That woman don't know nothing about no boundaries, man. I don't know why you put up with that, bro. A healthy relationship has proper boundaries. Yeah, I know, boundaries. Last time I tried to get some boundaries with her she tried to bind my hands and my feet and held me hostage for four hours. It was crazy. Man, y'all are crazy. Yeah, yeah, we crazy. I guess I'm crazy too. You know what, though, I ain't gonna lie. We used to have something special. We used to have something... it was something. - Something. - I just... Ever since I messed up that one time, - she never forgave me for it. - Yeah, she never forgave you. That's for sure. You know what, women don't... women are like elephants. They never forget. They act like they forget, but they don't forget. They be telling you they forget. They just want to make you feel like you forgot but they ain't forgot nothing. - What were we talking about? - Feel me on this. If you can cheat on your woman... Uh-huh. ...how can you say you love her? Maybe you don't love her if you can cheat on her, huh? - Boy, you know... - I'm just... I'm just... l-I-I-I never thought of that. - You know what? - What? Give me a minute, I'm gonna pray about this. You do that, go ahead, talk to Him, go ahead. Jesus... if I don't... if I cheat on her... (knocking) Oh, sh... Go, I ain't here, I'm invisible. This is it, man, you got a problem. (knocking) Hold on. - (whimpering) - Look at you. (exhaling) - Surprise. - Yvette. - Hey, sis. - Hey. I wasn't expecting you 'til next week. It's Yvette, how you doing? Yeah, well, I thought I'd surprise you. You know, I had to fly in to cover the game last minute with the flu bug going around. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good to see you. You don't mind if I crash, do you? Come on, stop it, of course, I'll get your room ready. Let me get you something to drink first. - Okay. - What you want? Um, some water. - Water it is. - Yes. I must say, sis, I'm pretty proud of you. Got the new job at the network, huh? Oh, thank you. My sister's a sportscaster. I've been watching all your stuff online. I saw that piece you did on concussions in the NFL. Really? It was pretty stellar, kind of stellar. (clearing throat) I've been, uh... I've been following you too. Wow. - Jarvis. - Yeah. I didn't expect to see you here. Well, I should have known you two are joined at the hip. Yeah, you know, I was trying to tell him about boundaries and stuff, you know what I'm saying? A healthy friendship has good boundaries and stuff. But he don't listen. - See a real relationship... - Okay, you know what, um... ...let me get your bag and, um... ...you guys can talk. - How's the weather? - So... - Eat your... - How's... Sorry. All right, um, I guess it's been a while. Yeah, it's been a minute. Yeah, yeah. Look, I'm... I know I didn't call and everything but, I mean the last time we spoke, - things kind of ended... - Yeah, I know, I understand. It's okay. I mean, I flew a thousand miles away and you didn't find it good to call me and check on me. No, "Yvette, how you doing?" Or maybe, "I'm sorry." After all this time, you still can't apologize. You know, maybe I should just go. No, no, no, no, no, no. You stay, I'll go. Yvette... ...I'm sorry. Thank you. How hard was that? (chuckling) L... I gotta go, 'cause, you know... Well, give me a hug. - For real? - Yes. Give me a hug, stop playing. - For real? - Stop it. - See? - Yeah. See, we can at least be friends. We... Friends? I think friends is a good idea. I think, yeah, this... Oh, that feels friendly, that's friendly. Oh, yeah, ooh, yeah, that's... - That's... - (door slamming) Oh, whoo! Hey, hi, girl! Hey, hey, um, have fun! How you doing, baby? You got the nerve to cheat on me with a cute girl? Hello, I'm Yvette, Elston's sister. - Uh-huh. - She cute. You know what, I should kill you right where you stand. After all I done for you. Wait, it's not like that, we're just old friends. Yeah, yeah, just listen to her. Just old friends. Listen here, baby girl, old friends don't embrace like that. - That's right. - You know, my mama was right. You can't trust a man as far as you can throw him. You ain't nothing but some two-timing no-good fool. Look, we were just... we just friends... I'm just visiting... I'm just visiting with her. - Just visiting? - Yes! Hey, hey, hey, what's all the commotion in here? It's just Raven, you know, acting out again. I'm gonna show you acting out. - You know what... - Take that out of my house. - I will see y'all, good night. - It was lovely seeing... And you know what? You stay away from my man. We're happy. Okay, thank you. - Good night. - Close the door behind you. Boy, I tell you. Should we be calling the police? No, that's them two all the time. Lucky there weren't no blood. He'll be all right in the morning. Am I safe here? What you mean, are you safe here? Big bro got your back, of course. Yeah, just like old times, huh? - Of course. - Um-hm. Mom did always say for you to look out for me no matter what. Yeah, she was always talking about keeping family first, huh? Yeah. I miss her. Yeah, not a minute goes by I don't... think about her, you know? Yeah. Only God knows why he needed her up there. Amen, sister. ## - I missed you. - It's good to see you. - Are you hungry? - Starving. Okay, we need to go out, sis. - I have no food here. - Clearly. (knocking) - Somebody knocking. Yvette: Yeah. Hey, uh... Oh, sorry, Elston, good to see you. Come on in here, baby. - You know my wife. - Of course. Good to see you. Listen, um, don't mean to barge in on you. We were on our way to a jazz club and there's a big accident on the Kennedy Expressway so decided to take your exit. - Got a bottle of the bubbly. - Okay. Thought I'd share it with you. We're so sorry to intrude. - This was not my idea. - That's nonsense. You guys are welcome. Make yourself at home. And who is this lovely young lady? This is my sister Yvette. You met her last year at the Christmas party. Yes, I remember. You still look smashing. Well, thank you. Yes, you're very cute. Thank you. Oh, my... What's wrong? I was just caught off guard by the size of your feet. Damn. Please, don't take offense. L... It just startled me. Me a little bit too. Um, we better pop the cork on that bottle. I'll do the honors. Oh, look, allow me, I got it. Ah, Elston. Bathroom? (cell phone ringing) You know, this thing got a mind of its own. Hello, yes. Excuse me. Yes, I can follow the team to Dallas. Yes, yes... Young man, would you mind helping a damsel in distress? No problem. Thank you. So, you know, some things require a strong young man's touch. (popping) Whoo, ah-ha-ha. I'm getting a raise. What are you doing here, Sheila? Hello-ho-ho. The question is, what are you doing here? I was just helping her, okay, relax. Yeah, look like you was helping yourself. Bag, please. Mr. Randall asked me come by and drop off these files after I came back home from my card game. Oh-ho-ho, I went blind seven. I'm set, baby. I won 50 bucks. Amen and amen. Whoo. Elston, uh... I hope I didn't tear it up too badly, man. Baby... I cannot eat any more of those burritos from that cantina. It just tore my stomach apart. Yeah, maybe we should get a move on it. Looks to me like somebody else has got a move on while you were gone. What does she mean by that? Oh, no, no, no, my tongue, it just gets loose, you know, when I get to sipping at those card games. Don't pay me no mind. You know, my tongue gets even looser when my pocketbook is lighter. Thank you very much. Your generosity is "muchly" appreciated. It's gonna go to a good cause. Here are you files. Oh, thank you. I didn't see nothing. Goodbye, Sheila. What's that all about? I think... you need to cut her hours. She got a couple screws loose. Don't we all. Listen, baby, why don't we have a little champagne? We just got here. Sit back and relax. Yeah, but, you know, maybe we should go. I'm feeling a little flushed. Just... a little flushed. Okay. Yeah, um... Maybe you guys should take a rain check, you know. You don't want her feeling weak and then you guys have an accident or something. Yeah, when I feel like this, I tend to be a little reckless. Okay, okay, buttercup. Whatever you want. We'll get you home and get you wrapped up, okay? Thank you. Can't keep my hands off of you. Hey, listen, um... - sorry we're leaving so soon. - No problem. But I left the bottle of champagne for you. And I'll see you in the office tomorrow, son. See you tomorrow, sir. - Let's go, baby. - Okay. ## - See you in the morning. - Come on, baby. According to this report, this should be a no-brainer. The trucker's blood alcohol level was well above the legal limit when he hit her. I don't know, man, what kind of monetary value can you put on a pinkie toe? Same as any toe. No, no, not necessarily. I mean, I don't know if the jury's gonna see it like that. You see, now, a pinkie toe probably should cost a little considerably less. I mean, no, a big toe, yeah, big toe... bucks, I understand that. But with a pinkie toe? Let bygones be bygones. What kind of open-toe shoes a 70-year-old woman gonna wear anyway? That pinkie toe is long gone. It's dead, forget about it. Sometimes I wonder what goes on in that head of yours. Look, I just say the things that people are scared to say. You say the things that scare me for you as well as future generations. I... I guess I'm just tripping, man. I've been going through some stuff lately, dude. This woman's crazy, dude, l... She's putting stuff on the stove, heating it up and everything. She's on some medieval stuff right now. I can't handle it, man, I don't know what's going on. Yeah, she got issues. Yeah, she got issues, but what does it say about me? I'm still with her. Why don't you stand up for yourself, man? You weren't like that in college. Yeah, I know. I know, I know, I guess I... Guess I lost my mojo a little bit, man. Yeah, it's like you lost your confidence after you didn't get drafted. You remember what happened, dude? I'm sitting there waiting to get drafted. The agent snatches the chicken wing right out of my mouth. Just like that, you know? In front of my friends, my family members. I had the whole party set up, it was embarrassing, dude. I remember, I had to pay half the bill. That was the most humiliating day of my life. Hands down. It was just... humiliating. You was a loser, too. Yes, you know what? My grandmother even called me a loser. You're not a loser, man. Look, you're... you're... look, you're a junior lawyer. Come on. I'm a junior lawyer. Yes, and now you probably should leave. You know what? On that note, I'm just gonna get out of here, man. - I got some things to take care of. - All right. - You can finish up yourself. - Shake it off, buddy. Junior lawyer. ## - (sighing) - (knocking) Uh... ...what are you doing here? - Shh! Look... No, listen, about last night, uh... Shh. I was totally in the wrong. Don't say not another word. It was my fault. Sometimes I just... I just don't think straight. No, it's okay, I know what you mean. Listen, let's just promise each other that it won't happen again. No harm, no foul, right? - Agreed. - Agreed. Now I think it would be in your best interest to clear the premises 'cause you do not want to let Sheila catch you here. You know how she is. I slipped her a 20 on the way in. She's looking out for me. Ah, the power of money, I love it. See, that's just it, Elston. I thought that money would make me happy. I thought that it would make me love him more but it didn't. I ended up marrying for all the wrong reasons and when I look at you, it just reminds me that, um... Yeah, listen, um... I'm not sure I wanna have this conversation now. He's my boss and he's been really good to me. All right? You think you know that man? You don't. That man, he is greedy and he is low-down. - Okay... - He built this firm on the backs of loyal, hard-working, dedicated people like you. He's just like his father and his grandfather. Okay, listen. He's your husband, all right. Yes, and that's why I have the right to tell the truth. Okay, I'd really rather not have this conversation, all right? All right, maybe you're right. I'm sorry to bother you. It's no problem. He's coming down the hall. If you want me to fake a seizure, it'll be an extra 40 bucks. - It's not necessary. - You sure? I talked myself out of two speeding tickets that way. Works like a charm. Come on, girl, now you... No, no, no, you are not about to pay my bills if I lose this job. Now come on, get your stuff, get your bags together. Come on, get out of here, get out! Look... everything's gonna come to the light. You're gonna see the truth. (door closing) Yeah, baby, yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah, I just went to the bathroom. That's all I did. I know, I should have called you on my cell phone, but, yeah, it takes a little longer 'cause they didn't have paper towels. And you know I don't like to air dry. I can't go back to my desk soggy. Sweet... No, no, I didn't. Okay, number two. Are you happy? No, I didn't go talk to the Human Resources lady. No, you messed that up for me, yeah, you did. Yeah, you remember, you called in a bomb threat. Yeah, now she's scared to death. Yeah, every time she see me, yeah, she runs in the opposite direction. Imagine Flo Jo on the 47th floor in kitten heels, just going that way. That's what happens. - Yeah, un-huh. - (crying) Yeah, okay, look, baby, I'm gonna call you back, okay? Yeah, in 10.4 minutes. Yeah, I'll call you back, I promise. I know you're counting. Okay, love you. He dumped me! Who... who, Charles? The married guy. Yeah, he said I should've known that what we had was just temporary. Just for fun. Ohh... I feel so used. Oh, ooh, oh. I mean, ooh, don't cry. Oh, oh, the pain, I can feel the pain from... Don't cry. Come on, ooh, come on, just... I know, even trampolines need love too. I hate to say I told you so, Sheila. - But I told you so. - Gee, thanks. Well, what... Well, what do you want me to say? What do you expect for me to say? When you're wrong, you're wrong, Sheila. You can't be going around wrecking people's homes, wrecking this, wrecking that. In the words of the immortal Ice Cube: # You better check yourself # # Before you wreck yourself # # You better check yourself... ## You can't even understand. You can't. No. I never had no one to love me, okay? My father left me and my mother when I was eight years old. Do you know what it's like to cry yourself to sleep at night because you miss somebody so much? Do you wonder? You ever wonder why somebody doesn't love you? No, no, you don't. So you just need to shut your mouth! That's enough now. I know what it feels like to hurt. I know what it feels like to have a spicy chicken wing ripped out of your mouth when you don't make the draft. And you know what? I know what it's like to pay the bill at that dinner at that draft. You know how embarrassing that is? You know how hard it is to go back to the block where you ain't got drafted? Now I'm here dealing with you and everything. I know about that pain. I deal with that pain every day. But you know what, I know God's got my back. God don't like ugly. So of course you're gonna have a little harder time than most. You are, I'm just saying. But still, you gotta get down on your knees. You gotta get down on your knees and pray. Hallelujah, Honda Civic, Osama Bama. Yes, you gotta get down on your knees and you got to pray, all right? You know, I just... You know what, I'm gonna get back to work because if I get to preaching around here, I'm gonna get the Holy Ghost. Y'all ain't gonna hear me up in this piece. You know, I'm gonna go off. Whoo, Lord, Jesus, amen... Sheila. Can you hold all my calls please? Uh, Yeah, Mr. Rand... hey, how you doing? You need some coffee, take your coat, anything? Yeah, I need a coffee with three Splendas. Okay, three Splendas, all right, and so, uh... three Splendas, so Jarvis Brown getting your coffee. Remember Jarvis Brown, 'cause I get the coffee. Go this way, all right now... Can you have Elston meet me in my office? I need to have a very personal conversation with him. Oh, yes, sir. Remember, Jarvis Brown, coffee, anytime. Got ya, I'll be right back. (humming) Oh, he knows. He knows, he knows everything. - Did you open your big mouth? - I can't believe it, I can't believe it. - My money supply's gonna dry! - I didn't do anything. - What if I die, what if I die? - I didn't do anything. Take it to the grave, man. Take it to the grave, that's that I always say, man. That's it, I'm telling you right now... You've been so good to me. I can't believe he's gonna kill you. First you're gonna get fired. Oh, no, I'm gonna miss you so much, Elston. Where's he at? He said for you to meet him in the conference room. All right, conference room it is. Oh, Elston... after you get killed, since I know the combination to your safe can I have that $1,500... please? I'm saving for a beauty procedure. Ooh. Okay, Mom, can you just sing the first part for me? Yeah, I'm stressed out right now. Everybody here is crazy. Yeah, okay, just sing it like you used to. I'll sing with you. Okay, okay. # Twinkle, twinkle # # Little star ## Yeah, uh, yeah, like I was saying, I just punched him in the face. You know, that's what we do, we slap people for fun. Yeah, that's what we do here at the law firm. Yeah, uh-huh, all right, okay, I gotta go. Yo... what's up, man? I'll tell you later. I ain't seen your face long like that since you punched a cheerleader for stealing your dance moves. That was you, not me. Oh, yeah, that's right, yeah, yeah. I would've left him alone too if he didn't take my signature spin move. She's not answering. Listen, tell Yvette I'm not gonna be able to make lunch. I got something I need to handle. Okay, boss, no problem. Mom, you still there? # Ooh-ooh-ooh... ## Mr. Trace, I need to talk to you. Have a seat. No, sir, I'd rather stand. I'd rather you sit. I'd rather stand, sir. Young man, have a seat. Please. What is it? ## - Well, sir, I... - Wait, son, let me stop you. I know exactly what you wanna say, okay? Sir... Son, let me stop you. I wanna talk to you about something that's very dear to my heart. I know, that is why I want to talk... Listen. (sighing) This firm has been the cornerstone of this community for over a decade. And I'm very proud of that. And I don't make any decisions in here that are not in the best interests of this firm, even when it's personal. Right, sir. So I've decided... ...I've decided to, uh... interview for the... Vice President of Operations position. It doesn't mean you're not gonna get the job. It just means I think we may go with somebody a little bit more qualified. More qualified? I put my blood, sweat and tears in this place for a decade. I know you did. Long hours, no vacations. How can you tell me "more qualified"?! That's my position. Son, I've been watching you and you've been walking around here with your... your chest poked out, like you're the big gun, like you're the top gun, like you're running things around here. Like I owe you something. Can I ask you a question? Do I owe you something? Now, son, you're not ready. (scoffing) Maybe you'll be ready in a few years. But you're not ready now. So I'll have my decision in a few weeks. I don't have any words right now. Sometimes no words is the best answer. Can I go? I have some work to do. You know, I have to go pick up that Simmons check. You know, she's getting a half a million dollars for a pinkie toe? Do you know how much she could've got for a big toe? (laughing) You know what? If you threw in a hand and a foot... (laughing) ...she could clean up. (laughing) Listen... it's gonna be fine. God... Oh... Charles, can you please stop sending me directly to your voice-mail and call me back? Please? What are you doing here? He just walked out. I was listening at the door. I guess you were right, I... I tried to warn you. I have to admit it, I... I just don't think you understand what I did for that man. Win all those cases. Long hours. I haven't had a vacation in five years. Three days after my mother passed I was back at work. I deserve that promotion. Elston, you're an attorney. You know you don't get in life what you deserve. You get what you negotiate. When he needed you, you should've just talked to him. Now that you need him, you don't have a leg to stand on. It's your husband, though, what do I do, like... Let me just talk to him. You know, pillow talk does wonders. You would do that? Yeah. ## I appreciate it. Come here, I can make you feel better. No, it's... No... Look, don't say no. That's your problem. You're always looking out for somebody else and how they feel. You need to focus on yourself. Elston, I know you want to. Everybody needs somebody. Come here. - Let me make you feel better. - Vanessa... Shh. (whistling) Oh! I'm sorry to intrude. I guess I should have knocked. Well, yeah. I almost forgot you was here. The last time that Elston had a woman at his house the Bulls were winning the championship. I know you was doing the cabbage patch and everything... Okay, okay, I forgive you. So what you watching? A special on the greatest NFL defenses of all time. Hmm, okay. Okay, who would you pick: The '86 Bears or the '76 Steelers? Uh, okay, that's a good question. Well, you know, everybody knows that I'm a hardcore Bears fan... but I'm gonna have to discreetly go with the Steel Curtain on this one. You know, you can't beat that total dominance on the field. Right, right. Okay, as usual, I agree with you. You are the expert, so, you know. Please, you're a walking sports encyclopedia. Well, it is kind of impressive up there sometimes. You know what I'm saying, but you know. - I just use it for sports, you know. - Stop it. You know everything. You know, that's one of the things that I love about you. - Really? - Yeah. You're such a smart man. - Smart man. - Mm-hmm. Uh... I should go call my mama. Jarvis, stop. Ooh, I mean... You know what, see, that right there. That right... that's what I like. Me and you, we can talk. You know, we just... it's easy. It's not complicated, it's like... And you don't try to change me. Didn't. I didn't try to change you. Didn't try to change me. Yeah, just like you... didn't have to break up with me. You didn't. I mean, you had me crying in the shower. I was singing Freddie Jackson songs. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I mean, it was... Okay, let's not dwell on the past, okay? I mean, sometimes people come into your life for a season. Yeah. Only God knows why. You know, my pastor, he preached a great word on the season of change in life last week. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Well, maybe you could help me with this. What do you do when someone you thought you loved turns out that you don't actually love them at all. Pray about it. I mean, the best thing I can tell you is to be honest with yourself. Be honest with her. But... you know my relationship with God. You know how I feel about it. I mean, with her... she doesn't see eye-to-eye about that. I mean, she hates organized religion. Well, pray for her and let the Holy Spirit deal with that. I mean, look... you... you should just love her and lead by example. You should let her see what He has done in your life. Wow. You see... this is why I dream about you so often. - Okay, stop... - No, I do. I mean, I be dreaming... I'll be asleep... - Dream about you. - Stop it. I mean, because you always have the right answers. Everything you say is just... it's magical. I mean, to be honest with you, lately I've been having these nightmares and, like, really scary... - Nightmares? - Nightmares! For real, like in the daytime, at my desk, just nightmares, and you're never in them. You're always in the good dreams. Okay, please. Spare me the details. All right, whatever, whatever. All right, well... Elston said he can't make it for lunch so, uh, how's about a hug? Uh, behave yourself. Come on, get your bigfoot over here and give me a hug now. Give me a hug. Fine. Oh, you crushed my toe. Just please stop it. All right. Keep talking about my feet. Hey, I'm not, you know, it is what it is, you know, hey. - You know I love you, right? - Mm-hm. But, uh, seriously, um... ...thanks for the advice. Anytime. Bye. Bye. (exhaling) Woman: Ooh, child. I heard you in here just-a crying and a-sniffling. It can't be that bad, can it? No, I'm sorry. Can I help you? Oh, I'm Mrs. Simmons. - You know, pinkie toe. - Oh... oh. I'm sorry for your loss. Oh, don't be silly. I'm here for my check. God done took that toe back, child. Ain't nothing I can do about that. Well, Mr. Randall, he went to pick it up. He insisted that he do it in person and deliver it to you. See, that's why I called this firm right away as soon as I had that accident. The personal service. His grandfather was like that too, you know. Well, it's the least we can do, considering... Honey, don't feel sorry for me. Feel sorry for yourself but that man better hurry up and come on because I'm late for my tango class. - Shoot. - Tango? What part of "tango" don't you understand? The "tang" or the "go"? See, that's what's wrong with you young people. You're running around here upset because your life ain't going the way you want. That's because you're not grounded in the word. You don't know how God operates. Honey, life is like a parade. You standing on the street watching but God is way up top looking down. He's in the beginning of the parade and the end of the parade. But you came. That's why we have to have faith, sister. Well, is that... Is that why He makes us feel pain? The Bible says: "Weeping endures for a night "but joy... joy cometh in the morning" Hallelujah! Try Him. Ask Him. Ask Him to reveal Himself to you. ## Ask Him to give you the strength so that you can endure. And you'll see. All things come together for good for those who love the Lord. That's why God let me lose this toe so I could be a blessing to somebody. See, I'm leaving most of this money for some college scholarships. Oh. Oh, yes, God had a plan, honey. Whoa, that is so generous of you. Oh, that ain't nothing, I didn't do nothing. God did it all. And this ain't nothing. My parents were junkies. Left me on a housekeeper's doorstep when I was ten. Hurt like hell. But then one day I picked up that Bible and I learned that I could not dwell in the past. My future was up to me. I couldn't let somebody else's stupid decisions impact my thoughts. I couldn't let all that anger and hurt control my life. 'Cause I knew I was somebody. - And you know why? - Why? 'Cause my Heavenly Father said so. He loves me just the way I am. I just had to learn to see myself the way God sees me and someone He loved enough to give His life for. Thank you for your kind words. Well, I'm gonna run out of kind words if that man don't hurry up and get here soon. You gonna see the soft side come right on up out of me, child. I'm going to my tango lesson. Hey, look, I know that she's your sister and everything and you're probably the last person I need to be talking to about this but, look, man, I haven't felt this way in a long time. She's woken up something inside of me. I'm so confused. It must be going around. You know, I can feel it deep down in my heart. I can feel that little love and I just... You know what, I should confess. No, I can't confess, that would be a nightmare. You know, usually I always got somebody to talk to about this but, you know, my mama, she got that samba dance-off tonight so that's a no-go. - I gotta get out of here. - What? Cover for me. - Hey, uh, okay. - Cover for me. - (door closing) - Some friend you are. Oh. Lord, Lord! Lord, I know it's been a while. It's been a long, long while but I can't do this no more. I'm empty. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm... give it all to you and see what you have in store for my life. I'm through with married men. I'm not dating no more of them and I'm through with all of that nonsense. And I'm gonna stop trying to cover up the pain with material things and improper relationships I know ain't going nowhere. I'm just trusting you and I'm gonna give it to you, Lord. I'm gonna give it all to you. Amen. Amen. (sniffling) You're moving up in the corporate world. No more of this mom-and-pop nonsense. Yeah, you're right. You gotta be the lion in the jungle that roars. Look, I say you let him work for you another year or two... then maybe you'll reconsider after the merger. Maybe a promotion, maybe not. Now remember what we talked about. I don't... I don't want to tell any of the other senior lawyers that I'm going to put $500,000 bonus aside for them, okay? - Mm-hmm, you're the boss. - All right, until after the merger. And I've already put Elston's money aside, okay? How do you know he won't take this money and start his own firm and take a couple of your clients or two? I say reconsider. That's why I love you 'cause you're so cunning and you're so shrewd. Love you too. Give me a kiss. ## You better go. I'll talk to you later. I need to talk to you, Jarvis. Do I have a choice? Not really. Okay, I'll just do what I do best. I'll get talked at. You see... that right there is exactly my point. I have done everything, everything to try to get over what you did to us. To help us stay together. But I have so much anger and pain towards you... ...and I don't know how to let it go. Look, I've been through therapy. I've been down to the church. I've cried in front of the whole congregation. Just, I had... I'm crying like Jimmy Swaggart in front of a whole church for you. To show you that I'm sorry. But... it's not enough. I've asked God for forgiveness. But that doesn't matter. I really need your forgiveness. You had no right... You had no right... to hurt me like that, Jarvis. What do you want? What do you want, hmm? You think I'm supposed to take this punishment day in after day, huh? Do you want blood? Raven, do you want blood? Well, here, here. - I'll take blood. - No, I don't want blood, Jarvis. Take it, you want blood. Obviously you do. - Obviously you do because you... - No. You know what? Look, I know that you're not in love with me anymore. And you know how I know? That's not true. 'Cause you used to have a light in your eyes every time you looked at me. And that light has gone out, Jarvis. Why? Why? Because you've taken that light and you've chewed it out of me. You know, do you even know who I am anymore? Look, l... I'm a social butterfly. I like to get out, I like to socialize with people. I like to see and get to know the world. I tried to take you to church. You didn't want to do that. I tried to pray with you, you don't want to do that. What am I gonna do now? I can't... I can't go on like this. - I'm sorry... - No, you're not sorry. Because I know when that light went. I saw it when you looked at her. Do you even love me anymore? Come on with this... Do you even love me? What kind of question... what kind of question... - Just answer the question, Jarvis. - I... - l... - Don't. Just... just don't. I'll have my sister pack my things. - It doesn't have to end like this. - Don't! Don't. You should've thought about that when you slept with her. ## I'm sorry we didn't get to spend much time together. I mean, you've been working so much. I know. I feel so terrible. It's okay. I mean, I needed the quiet time. And plus, your couch is so comfortable. I could really move in. Well, you know, my couch is your couch. Listen, you need anything? You need some money or something or... Your baby sis is all grown up now. I can take care of myself. You make me feel so old. I cannot process how fast you're growing up. Well, we'll have plenty of time to talk about it - at the Super Bowl. - Yes, we will. 'Cause what man in his right mind would turn down free Super Bowl tickets, huh? Come here, give me a hug. Give me a hug. - I'm glad you came. - Yeah, me too. Um... I know I don't say this, but... - I've always looked up to you. - Aw. No, I do. When mom died... you were the strong one. You held us together. You're a hard-working and good man. An honest and Godly man. So please... don't change for anyone. Let me know if you need anything, all right? - I love you, too. - Okay. Do you think it would be okay if I stop by the office and tell Jarvis bye? Yes, yes, he's been texting me all day. Him and his girl finally split up for good so now's he's... Oh, okay, well, I will holler at you later. - Okay. - Yes. - See you at the Super Bowl. - Yes. - And I love you. - Love you too. - Yes, okay. - Drive... safe. I will. Whoo. (knocking) What, you forgot your keys, huh? (knocking) Wow. Yeah, I saw Sheila at the office. She said you'd be here. Amazingly, she didn't charge me this time because she said something about a building and a parade and God was on top of the building and... Yeah, um... You never know with Sheila. Yeah. Um... have a seat. Gladly. Can I, um, get you something to drink? No, that's okay. Oh, I saw your sister leaving out. I tried to duck behind the bushes and ended up twisting my ankle and ruining my shoes. Oh, wow, you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. It's nothing Randall won't fix. Listen, um... about yesterday, I... About yesterday. You know, I... Yeah, kind of awkward, I just wasn't... Look, just hush. Don't say a word. Why don't you just relax and let's go with the flow and see where this takes us. Yeah. Don't be so stiff, Elston. Come on. You only live once. You know, I just... I just never... I never done anything like this before. I really don't know how to feel. I mean, you're on my mind all day. I can smell your perfume. I feel your touch when I close my eyes. Yeah. I think about you all day, too. I know how you feel. I just feel so guilty. - But at the same time... - It's kind of exciting. ## ## (cell phone ringing) Trace, Trace and Trace. Well, sure. I'll transfer you right now. And God bless you. Excuse me, hi. I'm here for a meeting with Darion Jackson. Oh, well, why do you want to see Darion? Just being nosey. Well, I'm opposing counsel for Gladie Insurance. Kramer case. Now, y'all know y'all need to pay up. Now, come on. That woman ran smack into Mrs. Gladie while she was standing there minding her own business. Yes, minding her own business while backing up on a major street. Well, the woman has Alzheimer's. She gets confused. Now, how can you punish somebody like that? True, I'd be confused too if I was sending a text and eating curly fries at the same time. Well, see, now you gotta understand about the curly fries. You gotta eat 'em while they're hot. You're funny. Funny, funny like what? I'm here to amuse you, funny like what? Ha-ha, just kidding. (laughing) You married? See a ring on my finger? Get you something. - Here's my card. - Oh. Oh, okay. Oh... Oh, yes, yes. He'll see you now. Last door on the left. - Nice meeting you, Sheila. - Likewise. (chuckling) Jarvis: I'm so glad I got her out of my mind. That's too much. - (Yvette clearing throat) - Oh. - Are you busy? - Am I busy? No, I thought you left already. Have a seat, come on. Thanks. Um, yeah, I was on my way out but I thought I'd stop by. Well, I'm glad you did, I mean, I... Look, I'm sorry for all that stuff the other day with Raven. It's okay, no, no, no, really, it's okay. I mean, I can understand why a girl can get all crazy and angry over you. Well, you know, I've been known to break a few hearts from time to time... Okay, just like a man. - Don't know when to shut up. - A little too much? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, you know... So... So when you coming back? Ah, I'm not sure. You know me, always chasing that story. Yeah, I'm chasing you and you chasing your career. Yeah. Yeah. Well, um... I guess this is goodbye then. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - It's goodbye. - It's goodbye again. Yeah. Well, take care of yourself. Oh, you know me, always taking care of myself. Let's... I have an extra ticket to the Dallas game. Courtside. Courtside? - Did I stutter? - (laughing) Yvette, look. Even though I would love... and when I say love I do mean love... the idea of getting rid of all my worldly possessions and following you to the ends of the earth. I just can't right now. I mean, God has called me to a life of integrity and that's how I gotta be. I mean, I can't honestly give 100% to this until I have closure with Raven. And, I mean, this is how I am. Better yet... that's how God made me. I understand. That's... that's another one of the qualities that I love about you. You serve it straight up. It's just a double-edged sword sometimes. Take care. Hey, Raven, yeah, hi, yeah, it's me. Okay, all right, look, look, look, I need to talk... I need to talk... let me, can I speak? Can I speak, though? I need to talk to you about something serious. Where are we going with this relationship? Like, I am not gonna be your punching bag forever. Yeah, I just don't wanna play games anymore. Are you interested in trying to make it work? So it's over? Well, let it be over then, all right. But, look, look, look, I want my SpongeBob onesie back. No, that's mine, that's nonnegotiable. Yeah, oh, yeah, that's mine. Jarvis, look... I miss you so much and I'm not leaving without you. Not this time. You don't have to. Courtside it is. (laughing) - Okay, let's go. - Oh yeah, we're gonna be late. Oh, yeah! (horn honking) Andrew, you tell the most fascinating stories. I never would've guessed you were a war hero. Well, not exactly, I mean, I was a military lawyer and I served during wartime but... Sounds like a war hero to me. Okay, I'll take that. So how was your meeting? (sighing) You guys drive a hard bargain around here but honestly, you have made it all worth it. Those words just flow out of your mouth so smoothly. Keep talking. What time's your lunch break? Now. (chuckling) Ohh, and, um... I know the perfect place. It's on me since we just took all of your money. - Come on. - All right. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. It's been a while since I was able to spend time with someone like this, you know? Yeah, a man like you, I'm sure you have plenty of women around. You know, actually... I'm not really the type to have a lot of women around. I'm more of a... one-woman type of guy, you know? Okay. See, why didn't I meet you first? This is terrible. I would've chose you any day. Uh, that makes me feel good... sort of. So it's getting kind of late. I think you better go back to the office. I have to go to the mall before Randall gets back home. When will I see you again? Again. You'll see me soon. Well, I hope so. Oh, speaking of soon, I talked to Randall about approving your promotion. - You did. - Mm-hmm. That's wonderful. Look, don't thank me yet but I convinced him to give you a bonus when the deal goes through. We need to make a little side deal. Of course, what is it? Well, when the deal goes through, I need at least half. Randall is so slick. See, he has me in this little prenup that's so ironclad shut. He treats me like I'm a teenager and I'm a grown woman. I need zeros behind my bank account. You know what I mean? I got you... I guess, you know, um... Well, since you got me the job, I guess I would owe you something, you know? Good, exactly. I knew you'd see it my way. So I'm gonna have my lawyer draw up the contracts. Contracts? Look, pumpkin, let's not get business and fun mixed up. Okay? You take care of me, I'll take care of you. ## # Say what you wanna # # What was I doing? # # You're a married woman # # I was so lonely # # I can't deny # # You're a married woman # # I was taught # # Better than that # # I am so ashamed # # You're my boss's wife # # Lord what shall I do? # # You are you # # I am me # # We are differently # # Different styles # # Different taste # # I'm not like you # # I'm not like # # You ## (laughing) Let's sit down here a minute. Sure. - Ahh... - Ohh... Thank you for the wonderful lunch. Oh, but unfortunately, I have to get back to this hell hole. Well, I will admit, our firm is a lot bigger, nicer, more successful, of course, and clean but honestly, you should be happy because a lot of people wish they had jobs. Hmm, yeah, I guess... I guess you're right. But you... I used to work at a shoe department at Dillard's before I came here but I don't feel like going back to those stank feet and those stank attitudes all day. Mmm, I hear that. Well, hey, just as a side note, my firm Peterson, Lewis and Kramer is expanding into the Midwest and we are aggressively seeking new lawyers and talent so just wanna put that bug in your ear. Well, this bug is buzzing. (laughing) But, you know... my boss has been real good to me and not a lot of bosses would give you a two-hour lunch break. Um, so, um... Will I see you... will I see you again? I don't mean to be rude, but that is a mighty stupid question. What's your credit score? Well, I guess I'll call you later. - Mmm, you do that. - Un-huh. (mumbling) (chuckling) Sir, you want to see me? Yeah, have a seat. You've been knowing me a long time, am I right? - Yes, sir. - Good. I'm not gonna beat around the bush. What are you trying to accomplish by dealing with my wife? Sir, I'm not trying to accomplish... Save it, save it, save it. Your number came up on her cell phone. What's going on? Sir, there's nothing going on. Let me tell you something. I want you to really hear me. My wife is a nice lady. Young... naive, very kind. And whatever you're trying to do by going around me to get to her, - is not... - Sir... It's not going to work. You understand me? I'm the boss here. When I make decisions, they're final. You understand? So go back to your office and get to work. That's the last thing I'm gonna say. (door closing) Out of all the days I choose to leave my wallet in my gym shorts I choose today to do it. It's okay. Gosh, they said we can get on the next flight out. Don't beat yourself up. Beat myself up? I've been beat up enough for the last few years. And you don't ever have to worry about me beating myself up. - Jarvis. - Um... oh, you know what? Have a seat, look. I gotta holler at Elston real quick. I left my SpongeBob pillowcase at his crib. I gotta get it. - I can't fly without it. - SpongeBob? Yeah, SpongeBob. - There we go. - I'll be back, babe. Okay, I'll be here. Okay. (knocking) Come in. Elston, what's wrong? I came right over as soon as I got the message. Thank you for coming. You look upset, what's wrong? I should've never started this with you. Come on, don't tell me... - Listen. - You getting cold feet. We're just getting started. Vanessa, I've been putting my job on the line. I've been lying and deceiving people, walking around here. - This is not who I am. - What? You think I put a gun to your head and made you do this? - You wanted this just as bad as I did. - Vanessa... Vanessa, I can't do this! I cannot do this, this is not who I am. So you think it's that easy. You're just gonna stand right there and say that you're done? No, I'm not an old toy. You can't just toss me aside like I'm a piece of dirt! I never said you were an old toy, Vanessa. Listen... You're gonna listen to me and you're gonna do exactly what I say to do. Otherwise, I'm gonna ruin your career at this firm and you will never make another dime again. Now, Elston, I need you to sign that contract and I need you to sign it now. Get out! Get out, now! Sheila: You heard the man, you heard him. Get out. Boy, man, I thought I was devious, but you? You take the cake, honey, and all that money you gave me, I'm giving it back. - This... - I'm no longer into that. My life is a parade. - Parade? - Long story. You know what? This isn't over. (door closing) You know we gotta tell him, right? - Are you out of your mind? - Mrs. Simmons? - Pinkie toe? - Mm-hmm. She's my sister in the Lord now, you know. And she always says that the Bible says: "First go and be reconciled with your brother." Sheila, how can you be quoting the Bible at a time like this? Yeah, I know. But it's never too late, you know, even with a past as long and colorful as mine. Yes, very long and colorful. Come on now, we gotta go, now, come on, stand up. Come on, hold your head up. Man up and let's go. Elston. Sheila, you know I love you like a sister. I love you too. And I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. (chuckling) All right, let's go. - Hey. - Hey, uh... I'm busy right now doing some reading. Can this wait? No, sir, it cannot. What's the problem? Okay, um... I'm just gonna go ahead and say it, um... I've been having an affair with your wife. (chuckling) Is that what you came here to tell me? Is this... is this some... some kind of game? Some kind of scam or something? Because my wife wouldn't do anything like that. No, no, no, I helped them too and I'm ashamed of it. And they didn't even pay that much. This... this... this is a joke, this is not true, okay, so... Of course, this isn't true. Oh. Okay, listen... Why would you do something like that? I treated you like my own son. Yes, Elston, why would you do something like this? Sir, I don't know why I did it but I did it, okay, and... I'm so sorry. I disappointed myself, I disappointed you and I'm ashamed. And I'm willing to suffer the consequences, sir. I'm so sorry. Is this true? Of course it's not true, for goodness sakes. I treated you like a queen, is this true? Oh, come on, man. Yo, tell me this is a lie, E. You was about to get a promotion. I have here on my phone all the pictures and text messages that she sent... - Give me that! - No, no, no... (stammering) Jezebel! I'm sorry, sir. Why would you do this to me? You're gonna stand here and lie about it. Wow. I want you out of here. Talk to my lawyer in the morning. Go to my house. Give your keys to my housekeeper. You're the worst. As for you... I trusted you. I treated you like my own son. You lying, conniving little punk. I want you to go clean your desk out and leave your keys on top. Let me tell you something. If I was 20 years younger... Randall, Randall, Randall! Randall! You ain't kickin' nobody, homey. We're from Cabrini-Green. Everybody get out. Get out! Get out of my office! Get out! Let's go. Get out of my office. I am not your toy or your trophy. You just give me chump change. Do you know, all you did... Randall, was work, work, work, work. That's all you did. I needed some attention. (sniffling) I felt so worthless. All that money you make, you don't think I deserved any? I'm your wife. I want you out. Get out of my office before I call the cops and have them take you out. Get out of my office. - Get out of my office. - Take it. ## Elston: I feel so terrible. And you should, Johnny Heartthrob. - Slow down. - Jarvis. What, we can't talk about the truth around here anymore? Okay, what you did was horrible. I mean, but we've all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Did you ask him to forgive you? A million times. You only have to ask Him once. I love you no matter what and so does He, big bro. You always know what to say, huh, sis? Yeah, ain't she the best? (knocking) Ooh, sorry, that's my man. - Gotta go. - Wait, wait, whoa, your man? Let him in, I want to see his wedding ring. Let him in, come on. I told you, I'm done with all that. I don't air your dirty laundry, Mr. SpongeBob. Hey, uh, don't go there. Everybody, this is Andrew. Wait, he's from the Stevens firm. She's sleeping with the enemy. It's okay, guys, we're on neutral territory. For now, at least. Yo, Elston, hide the paperwork. How are you, man? I'm Elston. - Pleasure. - Please to meet you. Hey, listen, I'm gonna be straightforward. Sheila told me what happened, and, hey, I know all about your extensive trial experience with Trace. And, you know, pretty sure, you know, since now you're technically unemployed that the partners at our firm could make you a handsome offer to come on board with us because, honestly, we could use a guy like you. - As a partner? - Absolutely. I mean, board has to approve, of course but I'm sure it'll sail through. Because, honestly, Elston, you're, uh... reputation is very solid in Chicago. Okay, um... - Give me your card and... - Yeah. ...we'll go over some details on Monday. - Sure. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, Monday. Monday, Monday morning. As in 7:55 early Monday morning, bright and early, you know, and make sure your junior attorney - sends over the documents ASAP. - Jarvis. - Jarvis. - ASAP. Come on, Andrew, let's go before we miss the movie. Okay. - 'Cause we gonna get together. - Okay, all right. - Pleasure. - Pleasure, man. Hey, Monday. You better go ahead, girl. (laughing) Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to get my SpongeBob pillow 'cause, uh... I got me a flight to Dallas to catch. - Dallas? - Yeah. Courtside, bro. Wait, now look it, man. Take care of her, man. Yeah, man, you know, the Bible says, "When a man findeth his wife "he keepeth it, 'cause it's a good thing." You know, and, uh, I'll be damned if I let this good thing get away from me again. Amen, brother. So we gonna go. All right. I'll call you when we land. - Love you. - I love you too. I know where you live, Jarvis. - Hey, I know, I know. - Get it right. (knocking) I don't want any trouble. I'm not here for any trouble. Just wanted to talk. Come in. ## You're welcome to have a seat. No, I'm... too keyed up to sit down. I'd rather stand. Look, um... ...I've had a lot of time to think. Calmed down. Now I think I'm thinking straight. Well, I'm glad one of us can think straight. You know, the truth is, uh... I had suspicions about her all along. Hmm. But I was just blinded by her beauty. I was trying to convince myself not to think about it. But I knew eventually it would all blow up in my face. I don't know what to say. There ain't nothing to say. You know, uh... ...oh, she's beautiful. We didn't have a lot in common. You know, she likes that... just that booty-shaking rap music. That stuff they play on the young people channel. You know, I am... I'm more of a... a Luther Vandross man myself. I understand. We didn't have anything to talk about. It was all a facade. I mean, she made me feel young again. I put her up on a pedestal. But I knew... I knew it wasn't real. I didn't spend any time with her. So, um... what are you gonna do? Yeah, that's the question. You know, I want you to know something. You weren't the first. She's had about three affairs. I just didn't want to know. Well, I wish I knew you didn't wanna know. That's well said, young man. You know what you did was wrong. And I want you to know that it hurt. But I respect you as a man for taking responsibility for the mistakes that you've made. God knows I've made my own mistakes. I can't give you your job back but I want you to know that you were instrumental in helping me build my firm. So I want you to have this. What is it? Open it. It's a check. Sir, this is, uh... this is very generous, sir, but I can't take this. No, I want you to take it. Remember... Do I owe you something? Remember that? Yup. Well, I want you to know you did a great job in helping me build my firm. So I'm not giving you that. You earned it. I'll let myself out. Sir... Thank you. I know that I can't do anything to make... the past right again but I'll do everything to make it right in the future. Yeah... maybe. Maybe after this all passes, who knows? Maybe one day we'll be friends again. Maybe. But right now, I've gotta go and put my life back together. ## Thank you. ## ##
