Scenario is like a map drawing. - Sir! - Yup! When is your next project ready? Hey, what you talkin' about? What? Um... My next project... Would... Can you bring me in your story? l can be an extra 1 or 2, it's been my dream to act in your film. Hey, be in mine, first. She's so offthe wall. lt rocks! And when closed up to the girl, there tears running! And my nose running! Should've gathered quite. Hasn't it, Sir? Can't watch without tears, know why? That's called 'the way of directing'. Hey, what are you... Did l make you nervous in the class? l'm sorry, sir that l put you on the spot. No, that's not a problem but now... Do you know what you need? You need love relationship! That's how next project would come out! l love you, teacher. Things are not going well? l don't know. When l first quit myjob and decided to write, l thought l could make something out it. But l failed the contest, And not getting any recommendations. l guess l have no talents. Listen, what you need now isn't the talent. Love relationship! Huh? Love relationship. Say like, you will date the first man Who comes out ofthat door. Hey, the guys inside Are all the same. Yeah, or you are never dating anyone. Just do it. You got something to say? No, no... Yeon-hui was just about to... lt's nothing. You are leaving? Alright. - Bye. - Bye. Safe home. Not bad. A single father and a famous writer. - Sis. - What? - That's enough. - Alright. Are you up? Come here. Wow, is this the one? Looks so yummy! Let's see... How's it? Can l be frank? lack of something. Mom, mom! l'll eat it! Mom, seriously... lt is not the new recipe you need. lt is love relationship you need. Like what Picasso said, the origin of creation is passion and the origin of passion is love. Why don't you go for it? You've been mocking around with those silly writers. and now telling your mom to date? Quit it right away! Bring your own man like Picasso! Are you get it? Circulars! Half Moons! Rectangulars! Julienne! Wow, less than 20 seconds! What a record! Oi, you alright? Gettin' your finger cut everytime and be left with no fingers. No one's perfect in the beginning. You are too, Dad. l was full of prizes. And how's now? You little...! Easy, Dad. We are even now. Even? l should've controlled myself back in the high school. Stop, stop. l have news for you. What news? The bad new is... you will lose your own cook. Hey, why is that bad news? My tongue's tortured due to your weird food! lt's been through hard times. OK, your health food for tonight... also gets cancelled. Oi,oi, don't you know whatjoke is? Only kidding, boy. Health food... So, what's the good news? l passed the interview. They want me from tomorrow. - For real? - Yup, for real. Stop hitting with that thing. Only one out hundred and thirty, and the one is me! l'm so, so proud. The teacher's that famous? No doubt. She's the best for Korean cuisine. Court cuisine, traditional cuisine... Out of everything. She has over 1 ,000 recipes of her own. Oh, is that so? Busy? Hmm, come in. Yes, sir. Miss Lee, coffee for me. - And you? - Green tea. Miss Lee, make it two. Yes, sir. You have any other than this? Don't you like it? Not particularly... But... To be frank, your story is vague. Not like those cheap but making money or rather fullly artistic... getting prizes. Choose between two things... Your story only stays in between, just like your life now. Now you're lecturing on lives? To add... what you need now isn't the scenarios like this. You need something strong making your life up and high something hot and thrilling! What, like love? See, you know it! You haven't been using that for long Ms. MYUNG doesn't repeat what she says. So always listen carefully and even ifyou didn't, say yes and ask me later. Never talk back, OK? lfyou did... She's here. Good morning, Ma'am. He's the one, the second assistant. Ma'am, l am Min-soo. lngers are the life ofthe cook. What are those bandages? lt's OK. l'm used to it. Get out! Right now! What? How dare you bringing the smell ofthe smoke... To my cuisine! Ah, it isn't my shirt. lt's my dad's. He gave his brand shirt as it's my first day to work. Didn't think the smell would've been soaked. Smoking is still allowed... at your home? Your mother must be very understanding. l don't have one. She died. Well, take offthe shirt Or never come into my cuisine. Then what shall l wear? Told you not to talk back! Alright. Stop that. The ancient Greek believed... the essence of creation was Mimesis. A copy or imitation or reproduction ofthe fact. So called creation, it starts from imitating others that have gone ahead of us. So copying masters' writings isn't a shame thing. lt's a way of starting your own writings. - Teacher! - Yes. When's your next project? Right! l've been rejected for 7 bloody years! So what? lt is not that l don't want to! ltjust is not working out! You think l have some magic wand to print out the pieces? lt is something you write with your blood! Do you know a sinlge thing about writing? Can we continue outside on the grass? Such a parasite living off mom... FACELESS DESIRE Wait! MURDER IN THEAFTERNOON Please understand. lt's better this way. Oh, Sir... Yeon-hui, what are you... Heard this movie will end this week so... Good movie but no box office. Doesn't sound like others'. lt is others'. Your movie will be a great success. No worries. Thanks for the words. Not only the words, l mean it. Sir. What you need now is... That's enough. Oh, sorry. l've been hearing it these days so... No, l was out of line. lt is me who needs it. Actually, l know l need it too. Exactly what you need is... Teacher? This week's recipe! Get all ingredients ready by tomorrow, ok? These are old recipes from teacher's cook book. What? Do you question after her recipe? This recipe's been over First introduced... in Top 100 Korean Traditional Cuisine in 2004. - Right? - Yes... The recipes for TV programs don't always need to new. Enough if audience can easily follow and cook. Surely better if new is added though. He's yet ignorant about the TVs. l will educate him well. No, the questions are good if necessary. And you throw no questions. Good-bye, Ms. You! You're dead! What's wrong with you? Look, we need frying pans. Twenty minuites to recoding. - How are you, Ms. MYUNG? - How are you? Again, asking for your good care. We ask for your help and care, Ms. Sure. A new face? Yes, newlyjoined the 2nd assistant. Hello. You finally got one, Su-jin? He's teacher's assistant. Such a modest person you are. No wonder you are the best student. lsn't she, Ms.? Thanks but not really still long way to go. Don't feel too humble. Everybody stand-by okay? Hurry up! we have no time. Damn... What's wrong? Did you see her face? Just smiling when he said l was the best student of hers? Something wrong with that? Something wrong? Couldn't she just say yes? Stand-by, three two one. Hello to you all. This is KlM Jung-tae from 'Walk to Cuisine'. Today, we have Ms. MYUNG Hui-sook the best cook for traditional cuisine here with us to find out key to the taste. What's the secret ofthe recipe, today? The development in agriculture allows us to easily come across seasonal food at any time. lsn't she so cool? that it would be healthier to take seasonal food... That we can call it a shortcut to a well-being life. What a hick. Haven't you ever been to boradcast? Here, take one piece of long-ripen Kimchi and cover the Spanish mackerel with it. Put them here. And put various vegetables. And pour the sauce. - The meat broth, too? - Yes, please. - ls this right? - Yes, that's right. Then boil well and it is the steamed Spanish mackerel. By the way, usuaIIy the mackereI is known as the bestbIue fiish Butis there a reason whyyou chose Spanish mackereIinstead? What? That's not in the dialogue. Of course, the mackerel represents all the blue fish but mackerel has a lot of saturated fat that times like this when obesity is worried and a good diet is an issue, it would be better to use something lighter. l see... Cut! O.K! Thank you all for your efforts! - Hey, bring me the mirror. - Su-jin, clean all these. lt was alright... Hui-sook, Sorry for embarrassing you with an unexpected question. Not at all. lt was a good point. We could've been missed it ifyou didn't ask. Question at me anytime. You look always full of self-confidence. l could never speak without a dialogue Up until 20 years of being on TVs. Well, l've been cooking for 20 years and l wouldn't cook without a recipe. Excuse me, l'd better get ready for the next shoot. - Please clean up here. - Yes. Wouldn't cook without a recipe? How funny. ls she a plastic bottle? Recycling recipes for years? My wife even dubs what you say. l shall knock her down one night. What? Clean this. Ma'am, here's the meal. Where shall l put it? - Over there. - Yes. My legs got swollen. lt must've gotten cramped up. This might ruin shooting schedule... Shall l give some massage? Could you? Ouch... Make it soft... The muscles are really in a knot. lt seems easy when watching on TVs but it is not really when seeing it happening. But same old recipes over and over again. l'm sorry. l was wrong. lt could be important to develop new but l realized it also is important to make it easy for audience to follow. l apologize for what l said yesterday. No, you shouldn't. l admire you, teacher. You admire anyone? Where is he? - Su-jin. - Yes? Wait! l have something to ask you. What is it? Do you chuck away the ingredients after shooting? Why? if so, chuck it to me. My mom asks for that all the time. Ah... l see... Chuck it in the back of car when staffs are resting. Ma'am, it's Su-jin. Can l come in? Ma'am. l'm almost finished. - l'll be down, soon. - O.K Me, too. Alright. Ok, everyone. Let's call it a day. Don't forget to hand in your copy writings. Yes. - Offyou go. - Thank you, sir. Teacher, the wooden box is kind of a metaphor and the macguffin of... Sir, about the writings... Can l copy yours? Here she starts again. What! l like his writings the best! Doesn't that give enough reason? That's correct. But it is you he feels uncomfortable with. How mean! Ok. l'm sorry. l'd better be going it is a memorial day home. l'll see you guys next week. Already? ls she from the eldest' son? Bye. Hey, cheers for the wooden box! Cheers! Bottoms up! Shall we order more food? Guys, l gotta leave too. Why? We just began. Sorry, a very important meeting tomorrow. Bottoms up, everybody! Yeon-hui, where are you? Guys will notice ifyou follow right after. Let's go for the memorial day. - What a joke. - Hurry, hurry. Turn your back. Legs open wide. Wider. Wider. More. Fold one leg. The other leg up. Very good. This time, shoulders up. Fold your body like a baby in mom's womb. Leak your thumb. Sexier. This time like a baby. Turn to the back and fold your body. Good job. Usually, we think of mixing a strong taste with a soft. But l thought of mixing two softs. Like? Like to put tuna with an eggplant. Eggplant is mild and tuna is soft. And they go well together. Mild can be matched with something soft as well. Here, JANG's special recipe! Yes! What are you naming this? Tuna-eggplant. Oops, l'm sorry. l thought of planting eggs into mine. ls mine the tuna-egg, then l just ate that bit. Sorry. Here to submit the copy writings... Let's see which one you copied. Roman POLANSKl? l actually wanted to copy yours But someone already did. Are you disappointed? Not at all. You copied POLANSKl's then why should l be? l am nothing. No, you're peeved. l really wanted to copy yours. You know it. Sure, l know. - You do? - Of course! How much do you know? This much? This much? - You can't do that. - You don't believe me? ls that a thriiler? Hey, funny gal! - What're you doing? - You hit the target fair and square! What the hell! Come here! Why did you do that? You like getting beat up? Huh? Calm down. l gave you something to eat! Sang-mi, eat up. Yeah, you should peel a layer off. That's basic. Everyone knows it. Why not? Carry on! My good boy. Min-soo! Min-soo! Hey, JANG Min-soo! Hey! l called your name why didn't you answer? - Oh, boy! - l didn't hear you calling... By the way, didn't you see Ms. MYUNG passing by? She did just now... Has she gone to the office? By the way, tomorrow you have to take care of the soy sauce making classes all day long. No... You shouldn't do that. Hey, because ofyou l made soy sauce all week. A day is nothing. But you shouldn't do that! What? Why are you staring at me like that? Any problem? No, it's not that... Huh! You swine! Now you even grit your teeth? Alright! Today one of us will be buried together with the soy sauce jar! Come follow me! Right away! What do you think? Not good? Some parts are good, some parts are not. To be frank, lt is great. And to be honest l envy you. Really? Wow! Like l wish to say so but... Are you kidding? l'm so frustrated! - Frustrated? - Yes! Look there! Hey, l don't want this. What in the middle of the conversation. Your writing is good but without desire. Kind of gray, just like your life. Don't, it tickles! Hey, don't do this. l don't want it now. Don't. l don't like it there. Don't. Don't. - Stay still. - lt hurts. Stop it. You must drive the character to the limit Where there's no exit. But the writer herself is hesitating and the story gets lukewarm. - Stop it now. - Stay still. God says, you are neither cold nor hot, l'm about to spit you out of my mouth. Since the lead character is a chemist, he'd better use poison as a kill tool. You know, to make it dramatic. God says, - Neither hot - Nor cold to spit out. Thank you, Min-soo. l owe you a lot. You are giving me inspiration every time. l've been thinking of grinding my head each time l see blenders for the last 7 years. Now the inspirations burst out as l see you. You're writing until this time? What's wrong with a writer writing? Don't tell me you've written your last will. Get out. Have a go on this before l get out. What is it? Would you know if l explain? Just eat it. You said you won't be cooking. lt is different from the last ones. lt'd better be good this time... - This rocks! - Really? Thin slice of sirloin with clam... This is the best out everything you cooked. - Best ever! - Yes! Your teacher must be really great. She's changed such a fool to a genius. She's great but, So her student is, isn't he? See, kids these days are all know-it-alls. They think they grew up on their own. You have a student like that? Yeon-hui Not good? Some parts are good, some parts are not. Damn... To be honest, l'm upset. Why? Why can't l write like this? Why can' tl think ofthis? Same bed, same sex under the same sky. Why can't l think of what he thinks of? Hey, You are still young and... Like l wish to say so. Hey! You know how frustrated l am? - Really? Frustrated? - Of course! l know a solution. What is it? - Look there. - What is it? There... What are you doing in the middle ofthe conversation? - Your story is all good - Yes... But the girls in it are all the same. Only the change in the names but they behave and talk the same way. l've tried not to... Why do men exaggerate women? l thought ofyou when creating the character. Not much! Do l get horny with red colors? Am l a bull? Sorry, l was wrong. l will fix it, sorry. How long have you written all recipes? since mom died. This is great. Not really. Just pieces from here and there. The art starts from it. l've some ofyours put together as well. - Which one? - Give it to me. Here it is. This isn't some, it is a copy! No, it isn't. l've applied my own ideas as well. Actually... mine's piecing together parts of others as well. What? Min-soo, let's work things out together rather than copying each other's. Teacher... THE END Yes, yes, it is You! You've been writing until this time. l guess my daughter really is a writer. But you didn't like it. Your face tells that you are happy. Then that is what you need to do. - Mom. - Yes? l'm really happy now. That's great. Try this. You look quite confident. Just try. Let me try. Wow, this is awesome! The best ever for last few years! Best ofthe best! Where did you get an inspiration from? Yet a secret. Tell you later when it gets clear. Americano, deep but bitter No, it is my collection for 15 years. One week. Read it. Do it or chuck it. What're you sayin'? You have one week to ready this. We'll do it or chuck it. Tonight, we will study about our proudly and globally well-known sauce, Soy sauce. lt's cold. Why soy sauce? Not like ice cream? You don't know what you are missing. Soy sauce has methionine which wakes senses and provides oxygen to wake up your brain. Really? lce creams or honey only increase blood sugar, and get sticky which eventaully displease you after all. l see. But soy sauce is good for health and Fishy smell also excites the desire. Fishy? Or tasty? Tasty. Tasty. What are you doing at this hour? l left something. What is it? Well, something that may surprise you? What are you doing here? What would l do? l've been researching on soy sauce. Research... What was it you left? l guess it's in the other room. What is it that you looking for? Tell me. Oh, it's nothing. You've been with someone else? Why do think so? Two wine glasses in the sink. And all other dishes are for two. Su-jin, when you research on food You should start with two servings. Starting from 'two' expanding to 'us'. l thought you would know as being my best student. Your best student? Me? Who else would it be? No, l mean, exactly. Who else! Teacher, l just never read your thought about me And for the last 6,7 years l've been... - Su-jin! - Yes? l was doing my research. Yes, and? l don't like to be bothered so... Oh, l should assist you as your best student... l don't mean that! Then? Oh, that? l'm sorry. l shall leave you alone. Keep on your research. Thanks. Your best student is now... Thank you for leaving. Your best student is really going! - Alright, alright. - Good-night. - Min-soo! - T-tea-che-r... - Busy? - Oh, my bro! Sorry to make you come all the way here. - Come, seat here. - No, l'm alright. - No, here. - What's wrong? - You are sweating. - No. Drink something cool. Yes, sir. - Coffee and? - Green tea. Cold green tea with ice. Yes, sir. Bro, deal. Let's do this. You like it? Was it good? Good? No, it was rockin'! l first thought this wasn't yours. You usually don't kill people in yours. But here you killed four! - Five! - Yes, five. The way he kills is superb. No wonder the lead is a chemist. That was the tool for the use of poisoning. This is awesome. - Teacher! - Yes? About my script, how you told me to use poisoning? Yeah... l wasn't sure but once it began, it became alive and dramatic. Oh, was it? That's good. l admire you, teacher! Ah, O.K. Careful. Teacher. Your movie will be suceessful just like this. - Cheer up! - Thank you. - Teacher. - Yes? l'm reminded of the first time we met. Me, too. Teacher? Teacher! You are running like a horse. A horse? Weird kids. Who'd be in here? Yeon-hui, actually l copied your... She looked into my eyes direct, And said, 'Aren't you my best student'? Wow... Your dream came true! Though l'm a little disappointed. l thought l would be the one. l thought too, but l guess There needs to be something special than the talent between a teacher and a student. - Like what? - Like, l proofread her book when publishing her last best seller, the book that you read. Top 100 Korean Traditional Cuisine? Yes, that! And now after 6 years oftime when l became her best student, she publishes her cook book again. And asked me for proofreading again! This is what's special. Does she publish a book...? What are you doing out here? Nice Sun. Good for being out rather than staying inside. Let me do the same. Who knows l may come out with a script like yours. You read it? Many things to fix yet. No, it was perfect. Still many things to amend. lt was funny though What was? l've been reading KT writing contest's submissions as a jury and found one very similar to yours. Except for the lead being a female, poisoning, Sexually excited with red colors... Were exactly the same. Wait, wait. l'm reading the copy now. Who's the writer? A girl, CHOl Yeon-hui. This is exactly the same! Tuna-eggplant? lt sounds awkwardly sexy. This is definitely her style. Light and simple. Hey, look our names are in special thanks. l'll read it for you. Thank you to Miss KlM Su-jin for constant support for 6 years. And to Mr. JANG Min-soo for providing fresh ideas and inspirations. She missed the words 'best student' in front of my name. Bittersweet, isn't it? Yeah... So, you stole your student's and she stole her teacher's? To be exact, the chemist poisoning part is my idea. l recommeneded to her. So that's not stealing. But you recommended to her, then it's hers. You stole it back! Should you keep saying 'stealing'? Such a nonsense. Teacher and student! Teacher and student stealing each other's. You slept with her, right? Good? Pretty? What's in your brain! You did...! Not the right time for that conversation! Son, what's going on? Dad, you have many good students, right? l guess so. Do you steal their ideas and make it to your own? What are you talking about? l told you l was co-developing recipes with my teacher? Her basic recipe became really great with my ideas added. But her book Never mentions me in it. As if she's done it all herself. l feel betrayed and bitter. ls that it? Do professors mention their assistant names in their researches? Honor goes to the professors. l didn't only assist. l did co-developed. Still, how can you stand on the same level with the teacher? lf she successes with your help, you should congratulate her. Son, you should learn more. What an old way ofthinking! You do that to your students, too? Watch what you're saying! Do l look such a bully? All students think they are all good! All the same! Of course we did good, then who else? SECRETRECIPES byMYUNG This is the first time you ever treated fusion cuisine in your 25 years as a cook. Any changes in you? l thought the Korean traditional dishes need to be proudly loved also by our next generation young friends. Althgouh your body may get older, your thoughts and ideas are always young and fresh. Any know-hows? Keep your body young. - Thank you all. - Thank you. Thank you bye! - This way sir. - Yes. Teacher, you have a cable TV interview this afternoon and also a call from KBS. Ok. Make sure the schedules don't get mixed up. No worries. Min-soo, let's clean this up and get ready for the lecture. Oh, put a schedule on my desk. Sure! l told you to be careful with those! Don't you hear me? Why don't you tell me directly? Don't take it out on su-jin. l was in the same situation l've been supporting so hard But was left with no records. So l should understand as it is? l don't mean that. You don't know yet. What if l put you as a co-researcher? Could you handle all that gossip and scandal? First prints will have my name only but from the second printings with your name, too. The royalty of course will be shared. Teacher.... So, you should train yourself harder To be called and known as MYUNG Hui-sook's best student. But your best student is Su-jin. Never. As you know, She doesn't have the qualification. She is good with learning and following but that's it. No new ideas, neither be creative. How can she be my best student? As soon as the promotions finish, We will start our Wed. night lessons again. l miss the times when we work together. As well as you. - Sir! - Yup! Weren't you in the theatre the other day? Who were you with? What are you asking during the class? What are you talking about? We saw you there, too. But you ran away. - Stop it. -  lt definitely was you, though. Well, not an appropriate question. But the answer is No. l was home all day writing. That's a lie. You were wearing navyjacket with beige pants! Look, Ms. HONG Sang-mi! You've gone too far! Although we are all friendly, Don't you know how to respect? l told you, there's a border between a teacher and a student! Get out! Your fees will be refunded! Come, QuickIy. Nota good timing. Itis serious here. I don't care. we have more important thing to do. How can you think ofthat at this time? Just come out. I wiIIbutno sexnever today. l'm sorry but l must go. My mom's sick. Don't cry, Sang-mi. - Bye - Goodbye, Yeon-hui l knew you would do this. l told you never today! You submitted to KT contest? What? l did... Didn't you promise to show me before applying for it? l was running out oftime... And you didn't show me yours. Did you make the girl to get excited to kill when seeing red? How did you...? My friend was a jury and read yours. but the thing is he read mine before yours. l'm so sorry. l just thought... You were angry with the idea That l described you like a bull. Yes, that really was a bad idea but... But what? lt goes well with my story instead. l knew you were going to revise... - l didn't. - You should have. What the! l'm sorry... l was gonna revise in the second draft. l was running out oftime so l just wanted to complete it first. Then why did you submit it to the contest? 'Cause l knew l would just fail... You didn't. What? You passed and... You're competing for the final round. For real? Oh, my gosh! l passed! Now l feel like it. This is not the right time! Of course! lt's a perfect time! The hormone runs like crazy. Perfect? lt is the worst! My project is just about to be cancelled because ofyours! What do you mean? Think. Who would offer ifthey hear there's a same script out there? Sorry... l didn't mean any harm. l'm sorry. You don't need to be sorry. l copied yours, too. l changed my lead from being a teacher to a chemist and made him to poison others. Teacher! l'm sorry. ls that it? How can you steal mine? You stole mine, too! O.K, calm down and do as l say. That way we both can survive. No, how can l give up on the chance? Plus, if others see me giving up because l copied yours, my career finishes. Am l insane to throw my life into garbage? Exactly, so quit before you hear things. Why me? Because you are only new. A new writer copied others, that should be taken back. And a professional can copy others? Yes, professionals can copy or steal others. But the news are never allowed! They should be fresh. Yours is already spoiled! This isn't art, lt is territoriality! Yeon-hui... The art is territorial. Please listen to me. No. You really! Are you hitting me? Do it! lfyou think you have the right, hit me! Teacher! Wow... Looks wonderful. Who is that at the back? There's a border not to cross? We should respect teacher? ls that what you meant? Put some soybean paste into paprika with bean sauced sea bream. And now put them in the oven. Yes, and just wait for it to be cooked. Your new book is out in 7 years oftime and the feedback is so hot. Now he even helps to promote the book. ls that even allowed? What's wrong? You should be proud as the best student of hers. Oh, right. l am. But am l? Right? Thank you. Cut! O.K! Continue after lunch! Wow, you've been exercising? Yup. Cool, huh? So sexy. Can you do me a favor? Alright. Su-jin's acting weird, today. Girls are hard to treat. Easily turn sulky and sensitive. Who would read their thoughts? None ofthose apply to you, though. Not really. l'm just like a girl, too. You don't know how feminine l am. Stop that. Look at my legs, they are like rocks. Come on, what if someone comes in? Who would? We didn't care at that time. lt was back then. Ouch, it must be cramped. l can't move. Please come and take a look for me. Wait, let me see. Gosh, you shocked me. Do you want the left-over ingredients? They are fresh, today. That'd be nice. lt is only you who... Delicious. Okay, here is so good Wait... - Min-soo. - Teacher. Since when have they been in that relationship? For long. How come l didn't notice? Just a moment. Hello? Are you ready? O.K! Min-soo! Teacher! Su-jin, Su-jin! - Su-jin? - Su-jin! Yes, teacher. What's going on? Something very funny. - What is it? - Sound, Go! My last present for you. From a student who has no ideas and is not creative. Teacher! Teacher! Teacher! Take your student's script out from KT contest. This is the list ofjuries. There are many you know of. You've got guts to face me? lt wasn't a pure love, was it? To date, to be instructed on scripts, To write stories, all at once? Director Lim, to be straight... about the final round... No, not asking for a favor. CHOl Yeon-hui's 'Afternoon Desire'... Oh that? That's been on an issue. It was verysatisfying butshe retractedherself. No reason is toId butjustgiven up. Afternoon class's been cancelled and students are asking for refunds. lfthat's what they want, do so. Ms. MYUNG! l don't want them either. Please. Ms. MYUNG! What's happening here? You know how much we spent on this? l'm sorry. Sorry? ls that all you can say? Additional prints were ordered and what the heck is this? ls that him? What a kid! Mr. KlM! Min-soo! Don't you move a step from there. A kid still wet behind the ears. Mr. KlM, talk with me, please. l asked you not to come in this room. Something wrong? Are you alright? Why don't you go home and rest? l'll take care of myself. Stay outside. Others are looking. ls it that important? What others talk... Min-soo! What do you wanna say? l heard the additional prints were out. Yes, up to the third prints. What about my name like you said? That's when the new version is out. Difficult when only re-printing. They will have to re-design the book. You didn't say that last time. What's the difference? And is it that important to you now? You are just like a kid who thinks of what he needs only. Me? What about you? You think only about your situation and your feelings. Have you ever thought about how much l'd be hurt? Have you ever asked me about my feelings? Have you ever considered how l might be confused? What am l to you? Your student? Your toy for new inspirations? Have you ever considered me as your partner? What are you saying? You can't stand on the same level Just because you slept with me. l don't mean that! l'm asking ifyou loved me, thought me as your lover. What am l to you? Am l your sexual partner? Your assistant? Your student? What am l to you!? Answer me. Do you play around with boys every time you need a book out? l got it now. You only think ofyourself. Live as you want. Here's what you desire. What are you naming this? Tuna-eggplant. Oops, l'm sorry. l thought of planting eggs into mine. Mine is tuna-egg, then? l just ate that bit. Shall we find somewhere else? Yes... l guess... This is where we belong to. Yeah, l feel home. Giving me confidence. l happened to come back here again. You've given up from the contest. Why? You said you wouldn't. lt's not mine anyway. Like you said, l'm new but spoiled already. The answer is clear. Yeon-hui... You can kill me. Or hit me Until you feel alright. Please, don't. No, l mean it. l made a call yesterday to the jury to ask not to choose yours. But... You already have given up for me and l was still trying to steal yours. And drove you to the corner. From the first time we met, l was wrong. The day we met in the theatre. l was there to throw away my 2-year-old project Which was rejected after all. l saw you there and have gotten you To be freshly stimulated for inspirations. That was the only reason that time. lt's O.K. l was the same. l'm sorry. l'm really sorry. l'm sorry, Yeon-hui. l'm really sorry. Still, l thank you... ls this our last? Can we do it for the last time? Teacher! You really don't know or are you just pretending? l really don't know. l've been in panic for the last few days. What was it? What's yours? Mom, you've gone too far! How can you do that to a student? Are all teachers like that? What do you mean? ls there anyone else? No, l mean... So what are you gonna do? He leaves for ltaly tomorrow. lfyou are O.K, l wanna go, too. He knows? No, haven't told him. What if he resists? Then l'll only study hard. What if he agrees? You're gonna marry him? lt's not like you think. - Thanks, Dad. - O.K. Go. lt is good to see your film being on working. Come when it releases next year. Of course. Just make sure to have it on for long. l'll take that as a cheer. - Offyou go. - Dad. Safe trip. Call me when you arrive. Take care ofyourself. Mom. l love you so much. l love you, too. You aren't feeling left alone, right? - Come on, go. - No. - Come on. - Alright. Call me. - Call me often. - No tears, O.K? No worries. Bye-bye. AFTER 1 YEAR l never thought the pre-screening would be this tough. - Good job. - You, too. l got my next story brainstormed. Oh, same here. Did you... You thought of our story, too? - Yeon-hui? - Dad? - l'm here. - Of course here. l'll come to you. Stay there, l'll come. He's with you, right? - Your mom's here? - Yeah.
