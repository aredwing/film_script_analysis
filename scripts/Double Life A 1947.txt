Who done it for you, Lily Dache? I done it myself. What a great guy. You can say that again, son. The meeting will come to order. Hello, Barry. How are you, Mr. John? Dirty heel. Everybody says. He's a good actor. Yeah, but he's no good. Tony! Oh, hello, Ellen. Hello! I haven't seen you since, um... Sands point. Yes, that's right. I lost your number. I knew it was that. What are you geniuses up to? We're in the Freedley musical. How does it look? Chaotic. Well, good luck. Thanks. Good-bye. I'll be seeing you. Good-bye, Tony. What a darling. Stinker. What? What? Hello, mr. John. Hello, Anna. Hello, Max. Enter Anthony John - tall, handsome, charming. Shakes hands with his dearest friend and mentor and sits. How did it go last night? Fine, fine. "A riot. A veritable funfest." This play agrees with you. Ah, good old Anna - never forgets. If it were possible, I'd have you only in comedy always, so help me. Well, why isn't it? Every morning after I get up, I read a play, every night before I go to bed, and out of the lot, if one turns up that can be produced and that's got a part for you, I'm lucky. Listen. Do me a favor. Don't forget one thing - you're an actor. You don't say. A great actor. I bow. You got a responsibility. You can't stop. You can't limit yourself. All right. Don't get so excited. Well, I'm an excitable fellow. Come on. Let's have it. What is all this? Othello. Oh! Ho ho! No! I was looking over that old Othello scheme of yours. You don't know how good that is. Yes, we did have some good notions, all right. Good? Do you remember that thing you figured out for the ending? Yes. Where you strangle Desdemona with a kiss? Yes. Oh, it sounds ridiculous now. You're wrong. It's brilliant, and it's believable, isn't it, Victor? Isn't what? Isn't it brilliant? Also believable. The Othello thing. How are you, Tony? Blooming - blooming in spite of Max. He's been giving me a scream-by-scream description of my own idea. Want to do it, Tony? Do you want to direct it? I asked you first. I don't know. I don't know. I? I know some parts give me the willies, on the stage and off. Where's your ambition? All used up, Max. Well, almost all used up. Well, I've come a long way with it. Remember when I was that handsome juvenile dashing on with white flannels and a tennis racket? "I say, tennis anyone? Right-o. Let's have another go at it." Yes, and before that, the chorus of the student prince. I tell you, I was a happy hambone then. Vocabulary of 7 words. Funny, I remember my father even then, coming backstage for a touch. And telling me to get the best of it. "Get the best of it, boy-boy. never made it, see, but you can do it, kid. You can do it For the two of us." So I'd slip him a fin, and he'd mosey off. I never listened to him. I never listened to anyone but Brita. That's when I got ambition, my boy? When I married Brita. That's when I wanted to be something better than I was, to be an actor, a real actor. I had to teach myself to talk, do you know it? And move and think. I had to tear myself apart and put myself together again and again. The leftover pieces are all scattered somewhere between here and a thousand one-night stands. Oh, sure, I lost plenty? Fun and rest and friends and privacy, and in that cockeyed way things have of working out, it's even cost me Brita. Would you like to hear the story of my life? He was a good actor, your old man. Oh, thank you, Max, but you and I both know he died a doorman. Look, I wish you'd drop in and see the show tonight. It's all right, but it's not bouncing along the way it used to. Who's letting down? All of us except Brita, of course. Of course. She's always wonderful. There's something interests me, Tony, because it's none of my business. You and Brita, you've been divorced now, how long is it, 2 years? And 4 months. All right. And you're both still in love, aren't you? So? Why don't we marry again? Yeah. We love each other too much for that. I see. See you later, friends. Now, what about The Othello thing? Uh, look, don't count on me too much for this, Max. I've got a feeling it isn't the sort of thing I ought to do, great or no. Think it over. We'll talk about it later. All right. We ought to think about it, too. Why? A sensation. For someone who's been exposed to it as much as you have, it's a wonder you don't know more about acting. What is there to know? It's a talent. Some got it, some ain't. No, no. When you do it like Tony does, it's much more. The way he has of becoming someone else every night, for just a few hours, so completely... No, don't tell me that his whole system isn't affected by it. I swear I never saw such a thing. Here I bring up a great proposition, and everybody's as gloomy as closing in New Haven. I don't like trouble. We'll see. Yeah, all right. We'll see. Hello, Bill. Max. Victor here? Yeah. Right over there. I just got the proofs of Brita's new pictures for the sunday edition. Fine. Wait till you hear the next publicity campaign you're gonna do... knock you on your ear. Something new? New, old. Tell you tomorrow. Excuse me, mr. Lasler. I'm going to marry the most wonderful man in the world: Martin. My valet? Coffee, miss? Thank you, Martin. Just when did all this happen, Martin? Miss Cole did me the honor of accepting my proposal of marriage on may 14th last, sir. On may 15th, a fortnight ago... Thank you. Not at all, sir. I gave you my 2-weeks notice and informed you that I was going to be married. You didn't say it was to my girl. It didn't seem proper to do so, sir. Proper! What cheek. But what charm. It's no surprise to me. After all, he's a gentleman's gentleman. Beginning now, he's a lady's gentleman. I'm not going to cry. Ah, ducky. Honey. Martin! But my dear sir, my time was up when the clock struck. I hope I've given complete satisfaction. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Mother! Was I a bit over tonight? Oh, Max, I've been looking for you. Hello, mr. Lasler. Drop over the office. Hello, Victor, dear. That's you, sweetheart! Oh, Tony! There's something I want to talk to you about. Yes. Oh, a little later. Max, are you going to the party? No. I'll be... One more. Oh, leave 'em hungry, is what I say. What do you think? How did it go? Oh, it impressed me. There were a couple spots I wanted to talk to you about. Oh, look who's here? Shakespeare's agent, eh? Yes? Hello, Brita. Bill, come on in. Is it all right? If you don't stay too long. Hi, Gladys. Your new pictures. Oh, good. Oh, I better look them over in the morning. Tony and I are going? I know. I'm going, too. Can I hitch a ride with you? Of course. Hey, what's all this about a new play, something for you and Tony? Play? Sounded pretty definite, the way Max talked about it. I... I thought you knew. No, I didn't. Well, I hope it's a comedy, if they want me in it. Why? You've just had a year of one. You know Tony. When he's doing something gay like this, it's wonderful to be with him, but when he gets going on one of those deep numbers... It sounds as if you're trying to talk yourself out of marrying him again? Think so? Listen, we were engaged doing Oscar Wilde, broke it off doing O'Neill. We married doing Kaufman and Hart, and divorced doing Chekhov. Would you advise me to go through all that again? Would you take my advice? Mr. Friend, would you take my advice and clear out? She's got to get dressed. Sure. Sorry. I'll be waiting. All right. It seems to me like I spend half my life trying to keep people from not going crazy. And not succeeding. Brita: Ready, dear? Oh, come on in, darling. Well, I guess not many women would climb all the way up here to see you. You think not, eh? Ha ha. You'd be surprised. Oh, look. Oh, lovely. Beautiful. Honest, it's like they were married. It's like they were engaged, which is better than married. Tony, look that over tonight, will you? Try. I've got to go up to Gilbert's for a while. And talk to Brita about it. Aw, sure. See you. Good night. Good-bye. Bye. Talk to Brita about what? Othello. Oh, dear. Is that on again? Well, just thinking. What about a holiday, Tony? I'll take one before I do this, if I do it at all. Oh, sure, I know those holidays. I've shared them with you. You keep remembering the rehearsal date, rushing up to meet you. You think about your part. You worry. You wake up and pace the floor all night, and you go silent for long stretches all day. And those disappearances of yours. It's a living nightmare, not a holiday. That's right, that's right. But then what? It's not worth it, Tony. This past year, it's been fun, you know? There have been times when I almost thought we'd make it together again if we tried. Yeah? I know if we ever got mixed up in an Othello kind of thing it would be the end. Oh, but why, baby? You know why? Because you won't learn to leave it at midnight. I used to and never got past playing bits in stock, and you're the one that did that to me. Let's not forget that. Did what? Inspired me, or whatever you call it. Oh, we'll talk about it some other time. You're tired now. Come along. Let's go to the party and have a good, gay time, tell yokes to all the private peoples. Yokes. Jokes. And have a gorgeous supper. How about that? Are you ready? Ah, just about. Oh, yes, that's right. Bill is coming, too. I said we'd give him a lift. Fine. Look, darling, um... Yes? Would you mind going ahead with Bill and let me come later? Why? Oh, I don't know. I'd like to prowl around a bit and think this thing over. Tony. Run along, darling, will you? I'll come by later. Yes. Good night, Tony. Uh, good-bye, dear, And give my love to society. Matinee tomorrow, sir. We're almost out of gargle. I'll get some. Fine. Same kind all right? Yeah. Delicious. Good night, Mr. John. Good night. Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy. It is the green-eyed monster. All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven. 'Tis gone. Arise, black vengeance! Haply, for I am black... And have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have. [speaking italian] How's the chicken Cacciatore? It's your stomach. Coffee? Coffee. You all right? Fine. If you want some good wine, ask me, the boss. Some talk, ok. Nice girl to dance with, I'll see what I can do. No, grazie. Meglio solo. Parli italiano. Poco. Poco. Always glad to take care of a new customer. Thank you. Enjoy yourself. Take good care of him, Pat. You from out of town? Why? I don't know. You sound like Boston. I do? Mm-hmm. I was in Boston. That's why I thought. Pretty quiet up there. Oh, not the parts I was in. What parts? Oh, around. I had a pretty good job up there, too. I'm a masseuse. You don't say. Sure. You don't believe me? I can show you a certificate. I took a course in it. Masseusing? Sure. I been out on the coast, too. California? Sure. I was in Diego, Pedro, L.A., all over. But, uh, I came back east this last month. Like it better here? Soon as I make a few connections I'll like it better. Um, I may try the modeling game. All you need is a few connections. That's right. You want to know my name? All right. Pat. Pat Kroll. That we can call these delicate creatures ours but not their appetites. I had rather be a toad and live upon the vapor of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing I love. You talking to me? No. I thought you said something. Well, yes, I did, but it wasn't anything. You wanna know somethin'? What? You're cute. I'll be, uh, through here in three-quarters of an hour. We could, uh, tell each other our troubles, if you want to. Oh, sure. It's open. I couldn't find it. Been walking round and round. I was wondering. Can I help you? Oh, no, thanks. Coffee all right for you? Fine. Or would you like a beer? Uh, coffee will do. Sit down! I like to make new contacts. I like you, you know it? Now I do. You gonna say you like me? Later. Oh, thanks. You gonna tell me your name? Soon as I know it myself, yes. Oh, don't give me that. Give you what? I've handled lines all my life. So have I. Hey, what's so funny? It's a private joke between me and me. Come on, what's your name? Which one? Your real name, the one you were born with. I mean, they give you one when you were born. That's not my real name. What is it? I don't know. All right, calm down. You don't have to tell me. Look, if I could find out who I am, I'd be a happy man, you know it? Most people know who they are, or think they do, wich is the same thing. Simple for them. Want to know my name? Martin. Thank you. Also Ernest and Paul, Hamlet and Joe and maybe... Othello. Yes, and I'm French and Russian and English and Norwegian. I got mixed blood, too. All right, darling, and brave and cowardly and in love and not and trusting and jealous? Are you? What am I mixed up with here, some kind of nut? The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets is hushed within the hollow mine of earth and will not hear it. What committed? Impudent strumpet! What's the matter, fella? [Brita's voice] By heaven, you do me wrong. What? Nothing. I just said, "What's the matter, fella?" You're talking so funny, like you're... somebody else almost. I was. Are you feeling all right? Oh, sure. Don't talk funny no more. All right. In fact... Don't talk at all. All right. Why shouldn't Max want you to play it? All he'll have to do is to pace back and forth outside, like an expectant father. Tony: Well, what do you want him to do, play Iago? I just that I hate to see you getting pressured into anything. Maybe you're not sure I can play Othello. Now, Tony. I may not believe in myself, but I expect others to believe in me. Does that make sense? Oh, of course. What's this for? That is for nothing. Thank you, darling. You'd be a smashing Desdemona. You know it? It's funny. No one has even bothered to ask me if I want to play it or not? Not you, not anyone. Oh, Brita? It's all right. It's all right, darling. I'm used to it. I... used to what? To running after you while you chase the moon. Well, if you do go ahead, it means some hard work on my blankety-blank accent. You will be able to manage it, I'm sure. [speaking swedish] Translation, please. Oh, no. Eh, I can imagine. Right. What is it? It's nothing. The tricks your mind can play. You know, somewhere in the future I can see it all finished. I can see the whole magical production? Opened, praised. It feels fine to have done something worthy, and then I think of all the things that have to be done between now and then? The terrifying thought of that first rehearsal. The actors nervous and frightened... Though in the trade of war I have slain men... Tony: Your inner self telling you every instant you're making a mistake to try this, knowing all the time you're caught and it's too late to change your mind. 'Tis better as it is. Oh, no. Yes, Tony, it's fine. Trying to make someone else's words your own, thoughts your own... "Thou cunning'st pattern." Over and over and over. Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature. You whip your imagination into a frenzy. The key to the character? Jealousy, and you dig for it within yourself. What does it feel like? Real jealousy? Try to remember jealous moments in your own past. Jealousy. Jealousy. Find it, hold it, live it! Jealousy! And the hours when you worry about nothing but shoes and props and make-up and the costume fittings... That's perfect. That's wonderful. Really. And then the dress rehearsals? The heartening moments when it seems to be going right... Nay, but he prated. Hey, look out! The inevitable things that go wrong... Nerves, arguments, changes... Far, far into the night. Pills to help you stay awake... And pills to help you sleep. The part begins to seep into your life, and the battle begins? Imagination against reality. Keep each in its place? That's the job if you can do it. And all at once... It's opening night. And you look out at the audience, a terrifying monster with a thousand heads. You're in a kind of trance, only vaguely aware that the curtain is about to go up. Man: Places, please. Then, somehow, the next thing you know, the play is almost over. The last scene is about to begin. But you remember that you're on a stage in a theater, an audience in front of you... And suddenly? Suddenly you're startled by the sound of your own voice. Yet I'll not shed her blood, nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow and smooth as monumental alabaster. Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men. You try to hang on desperately. You're 2 men now, grappling for control? You... And Othello. Put out the light, and then... Put out the light. If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, I can again thy former light restore should I repent me. But once put out thy light... Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature, I know not where is that Promethean heat that can thy light relume. I must weep... But they are cruel tears? this sorrow's heavenly. It strikes where it doth love. She wakes. Who's there? Othello. Ay, Desdemona. Will you come to bed, milord? Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona? Ay, milord. If you bethink yourself of any crime unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace, solicit for it straight. Alas, milord, what may you mean by that? Well, do it, and be brief. I will walk by. I would not kill thy unprepared spirit. No, heaven forfend, I would not kill thy soul. Talk you of... Killing? Ay, I do. Alas! Why gnaw you so your nether lip? Some bloody passion shakes your very frame. You all right, Mr. Friend? Opening-night jitters. Look, if mr. Donlan or mr. Lasler ask for me, tell 'em I'm in the bar across the street. They've been there since the second act. Brita: I hope they do not point on me. Tony: Cease and be still! Brita: I will so. Oh... what's the matter? That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee thou gav'st to Cassio! No, by my life and soul. Send for the man and ask him. Sweet soul, take heed. take heed of perjury. Thou art on thy deathbed! Ay, but not yet to die. Yes, presently! Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin, for to deny each article with oath cannot remove nor choke the strong conception that I do groan withal. Thou art to die! Milord, have mercy on me. I say, Amen. And have you mercy, too. I never did offend you in my life, never loved Cassio. But with such general warranty of heaven as I might love, I never gave him token. By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in his hand. Oh, perjured woman, thou dost stone my heart and mak'st me call what I intend to do a murder, which I thought a sacrifice. I saw the handkerchief! He found it, then. I never gave it him. Send for him hither. Let him confess a truth. He has confessed. What, milord? That he hath used thee. How, unlawfully? Ay. He will not say so. No. His mouth is stopped. Honest Iago has taken order for it. Oh, my fear interprets. What, is he dead? Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge had stomach for them all. He is betrayed, and I undone! Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face? Oh, banish me, milord, but kill me not. Down, strumpet! Kill me tomorrow. let me live tonight. Nay. If you strive... But half an hour! Being done, there is no pause. While I say one prayer! It is too late. Milord! Milord! Oh, good milord! Milord! Milord! Milord... Milord! What ho! Oh, good milord, I would speak a word with you. It's almost over, Mr. Lasler. Well, you told me to tell you when it was the last scene. Oh, sure. Thanks. Last scene. What play? Our play. It's good. There's a murder in it. You don't say. Who to who? What? Who murders to who? Tony. Tony murders this girl. Kills her dead... With a kiss. Ridiculous. Unbelievable. Tonight, he murders this girl. Tomorrow, they'll probably murder him. Oh, no. How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief that was my wife's? I found it in my chamber, and he himself confessed even now that there he'd dropped it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire. Fool... Fool! Fool! You must forsake this room and go with us. Your power and your command is taken off, and Cassio rules in Cyprus. You shall close prisoner rest till that the nature of your fault be known to the Venetian state. Come, bring away. Soft you. A word or 2 before you go. I have done the state some service, and they know it. No more of that. I pray you, in your letters, when you shall these unlucky deeds relate... Speak of me as I am, nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well, of one not easily jealous, but being wrought, perplexed in the extreme, of one whose hand, like the base Judean, threw a pearl away richer than all of his tribe. One whose subdued eyes, albeit unused to the melting mood, drop tears... as fast as the Arabian trees their medicinable gum. Set you down this... And say besides, that in Aleppo once, where a malignant and a turban'd Turk beat a Venetian and traduced the state, I took by the throat the circumcised dog and smote him, thus! Oh, bloody period. All that's spoke is marred. I kissed thee ere I killed thee. No way but this, killing myself... To die upon a kiss. This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon. For he was great of heart. O Spartan dog, more fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea! Look on the tragic loading of this bed. This is thy work. The object poisons sight. Let it be hid. Myself will straight aboard, and to the state, this heavy act with heavy heart relate. Bravo! Bravo, Tony! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! All right, boys! Ok, house lights. That does it. That's it, boys. Thank you. You were wonderful, Tony. Woman: Congratulations, darling. Man: Perfectly marvelous performance. Second man: It really was. Third man: Tony, it's the best thing you've ever done. For heaven's sake, Tony. Stop walking around and relax. What ho, milord? Tony, if you'd never played anything else, my dear, this is... Brilliant. Or if you never play anything again. Well, I hope so. Now, now, Tony, I don't want you to monopolize Dolly all evening. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Are you all right, dear? You ask me that every 6 minutes. I care every 6 minutes. Here. I don't deserve you, Brita. Maybe that's why you haven't got me. There isn't much justice on earth, but there is some. If I burst out crying, it's going to be your fault. What's the matter? It's nothing. Brita, if you don't give me a hand With the Hollywood contingent I'll? Sure. Sure, Bill. I'm all right. Run along hither. Man: Farewell, old friend of mine. Second man: Farewell, old friend. Farewell, the tranquil mind. Farewell, content. Uh, yes. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, beware, milord, of jealousy. It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on. Tony: Out, strumpet! Brita! Man: Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? but that was but courtesy. Lechery, by his hand. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together. In sleep I heard him say, "Sweet Desdemona, Let us be wary. Let us hide our loves." Let us hide our loves. Let us hide our loves! It was like the riot of 1820. Were you there? Brita... Get me home, Brita. Please get me home. Oh, darling. Happy birthday, old lady. Oh, I... Oh, Tony, Tony. Thank you for this. Oh, it's nothing. It cost And worth it. Thank you. Look at me. I'm a Christmas tree. Here. From Max. Lovely. From Victor. My, my. From Main and Douglas. Ooh-hoo. Never seen better. And here, look? A locket from Bill. Isn't that sweet? Yeah. Yeah. Yours is my favorite, Tony. Would you like to go to a party? Look, darling, I'm a little bit late. Do you mind? You'd better hurry. Yes, that's right. I better. Thank you. Thank you again. This is a trick to put me from my suit. Pray you, let Cassio be received again. Fetch me the handkerchief. My mind misgives. Come, come. You'll never meet a more sufficient man. The handkerchief. Pray you, talk we of Cassio. The handkerchief! A man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love, shared dangers with you. The handkerchief! I'sooth, you are to blame. Zounds! Noises offstage, clumsy fools. Next time that happens, I'll crack him over the head with a stage brace. Tony, he didn't mean to. I don't care whether he meant to or not. All right, Tony. All right. If anyone doesn't like it or you don't like it? Let's hear about it, that's all. I'm only trying to find a way To make everybody happy. Ok, mr. John. Don't fuss, man. Man: Ready, mr. John. M'noble lord, if I give my wife a handkerchief... Send for him hither. Let him confess a truth. He hath confessed. What, Milord? That he hath used thee. How? Unlawfully? Ay... He will not say so. No, his mouth is stopped. Honest Iago hath taken order for it. My fear interprets. What, is he dead? Had all his hairs been lives... My great revenge had stomach for them all. A-alas... Alas, he is betrayed, and I undone. Out, strumpet! Oh, Tony! Weep thou for him to my face? Oh, banish me, milord, but kill me not! Yeah, banish you, down... Down, strumpet! Kill me tomorrow. Let me live tonight. Nay, if you strive? Brita, whispering: Tony? But half an hour. Down. Tony, Tony? Tony, please. Being done, there is no pause. But while I say one prayer. It is too late. Please, Tony. Tony? Tony... Tony, please, you're hurting me. What's going on? What's the matter with him? Woman, whispering: Mr. John, Mr. John, be careful, please. Man, whispering: What is he doing? Woman: Mr. John. Please stop him. Man: Do something. Man: Your cue. Mr. John. For heaven's sake, knock. Milord! Milord! Milord! Oh, good milord. I would speak a word with you. There is not! There is no excuse! Good evening, doctor. Good evening, fellas. If you'd only leave her alone for a few minutes, mr. John? And you keep out of this. Now, I'm warning you. Who's there?!! Well, what's the trouble? Well, what the? Hello, Tony. Who sent for you? I did. Holy jumping? Now this is a production. It's nothing. Just a little accident. My delicate leading lady can't be kissed without sending for her doctor. I'm afraid we overdid it a bit. Right at the top of the scene. Advice! Direction! Yelling it out! I'm sorry, Tony. I'm sorry. Who'd you think we were playing to, an audience of deaf-mutes? Tony, shut up! Brita... I'm sorry. Tony... I'm sorry, darling. You know I'd die before I'd hurt you. You know that, don't you? Yes, I know it. I know it. All forgiven, Tony. All forgiven. Gently. What a business, for heaven's sake. What a business. Close your eyes, Tony. Surprise coming. Close your eyes. All right. Now. Well. Good? Well, strike me pink. Thank you. Well, I never. Oh, stop it, Tony. Stop what? Making fun of me. Was I? Oh, let's eat it. I'm sorry. It's all right. It's all right. I'd like to have risen to the occasion. I'm tired. I don't know what's the matter with me. I mean, I do know what's the matter with me. Sorry, Brita. Beautiful cake. It's a beautiful idea. It's a beautiful thing you have done. Let's not go too far, huh? Do I get to eat myself? No novelty in that, is there? Sticks and stones may break my bones, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. It's from Henri's. What is? The cake. Restful here, isn't it? So far. Sort of sentimental. I'm as sentimental as the next fellow. By the way, what about him? Who? The next fellow. Well, I don't know. Oh, he's a good enough press agent, but do you think... Tony! What? New subject. Why? I don't like this one, and it's my party. Are you gonna marry him? No. Do you love him? No. Do you love anyone? No. No? Oh, Tony! Leave me alone! You haven't Finished your cake. I don't want it. You can't have your cake and eat it... And not want it. Oh, you fool. Oh, Tony. New subject. Good. What do you think you might like to do next? What play? Yeah. Max says we'll do another year in this. Oh, not with me. No. Tired of it? No. Sick of it. Sick. Perhaps you should stop then. Yeah, perhaps. But, you see? What? I don't know which is worse, with a part or without. Without one, I'm alone? Bad for me. Don't like myself very much. Don't say that. Well, it's true. The only answer was you. Tony. And nothing but failure there. Not all your fault. All mine. Whose fault was that? Fault? Oh, we're both responsible for all our good things and all our bad. You don't really believe that, do you? No. Mostly me. Yes. Always? Mostly. Then I don't suppose you would want to marry me again, would you? No, I wouldn't, darling. Why not? Because if at first you don't succeed, don't try again. Isn't that how it goes? No. Brita... You're my only friend. Help me. Anything? Anything, Tony, but let's not try marrying again. You're stuck on the guy... Oh, don't be idiotic. Why, Bill is? Don't call him that! That's his name. I don't care! Oh, Tony? Get away! Is he smooth? Is he charming? Does he speak gently? Does he write Lovely stories about you? Does he dance well? I don't. Remember? Do you? Does he listen? Does he sympathize? And what else Does he do? Does he? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it, Tony. You want me to go, huh? Yes. All right, I will. Now, Tony, listen? I don't want to see him and his silly, lovesick face around the theater. Now, you tell him, or I will! Oh, Tony. Meet him anywhere you like. Meet him here or at his place or in a rowboat in central park! Go away, Tony! Go away! Go now! No. No. No. Don't hurt Brita. Tony, as Othello: Yet she must die lest she betray more men. No... Get out. Out. You know I'd die before I'd hurt you. Careful. No control. Go home. "Go," she said. "Go now." Brita and Bill. Bill and Brita. Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell! Brita, Bill. Brita, Bill. Brita, Bill. Brita, Bill. Brita, Bill. Brita, Bill. Brita, Bill. Brita, Bill. Brita, Bill. Wait. Go back. I am. I am going back. Hello, Pat. Surprised to see me? Pat... Pat... Help me, Pat. Where is it? Where is she? Desdemona! No, Brita. Go now forever, farewell the tranquil mind. Farewell content. Help me. Find her. Brita! No... Pat. Pat. Pat. Pat. Who is it? Me. Who's me? Open up. Who is it? Me! Me! Hello, Pat. Surprised to see me? I sure am. You got your nerve. Yes. You waked me up. What do you take me for? You look different. I do? What's the idea the middle of the night? I had to see you. Important. Where you been lately and all that? I've been away. Like out of town? How come no postcard? You could at least send me a postcard. Oh, didn't have any. Who? Where I was. Where? Venice. Glad to see me? Sure I am. I'm always glad. Thank you. One thing, I always tell the truth. Maybe that's how come I got no steady. You do all right though. What do you mean? How many fellas you got, Pat? Hmm, a few. How many? I don't know what you mean by fella. Like me. None like you. Any press agents? What are you gassin' about? Any named Bill? No. Bill. Bill. Bill. Coffee's ready. Even if you wake me up, I'm glad you dropped over. Why? I don't know. I got the jitters lately. About yesterday it was, Vito down at the place? He dropped a tray of glasses. I must've jumped You need a rest. No. It's just... I don't know. Ha! It's like I'm scared all the time I'm gonna get run over by a truck, stuff like that. Or you eat a bad oyster and you got to get the stomach pump. Hey, how do you figure it? What? Maybe being alone so much does it a little. I may move in with Emily. You know her. Emily? No. The cashier. No. You want to put out the light? Put out the light. And then put out the light. If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, I can again thy former light restore, should I repent me? What? But once put out thy light, thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature, I know not where is that Promethean heat that can thy light relume. Listen, I think you better go. Seen Bill lately? Who? Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge had stomach for them all. Uh, I think you must be drunk. Brita, as Desdemona: He is betrayed, and I undone. Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face?! Listen, I think you'd better go. Brita: Banish me not! Kill me not! Down, strumpet! What's the matter with you? Brita: Tomorrow? Let me live tonight. Nay, if you strive... Emilia: M'lord! M'lord! Yes. 'Tis Emilia. Let me the curtains draw. What ho! M'lord! Where art thou? Tony? Tony? Man: Did you or anyone else touch the body? Landlady: I wouldn't touch a dead body. Ready for me? One more shot, doc. How did you happen to come into the apartment? They phoned from the cafe she was working. What's the name of the cafe? The Valencia. Would you repeat that name, please? Some eye-talian place. I don't know. Oh, come on now. You know the name of the cafe. They're picking on me, Joe. What was the name of the cafe? He don't know his elbow from a hot mug. So I says, talk to the dark room, not me. I know what my exposure was. Know what he is? A chowderhead, a pure chowderhead. I'm tellin' you. Whatever happened to Schofield, remember him, big tall guy, didn't smoke? I don't know. I heard Dallas. Yeah. Some girl he had down there. Hi, Al. Couldn't find the joint. No kidding. You're good and late. That desk. I'll murder 'im. Look at the address he give me. No excuse. Next time bring a note from your mother. What's the deal? Here. Thanks. I got time for a cup of coffee, ya think? Who's the medic? Stauffer. You got time for a 10-course dinner. Ray Bonner's on it, too, though. He'll bounce 'im along. What did I tell you? Ok, Ray? that's all. Get in close, Bunny. Kirk wants some heads. All right, here we go. I'm gonna say it slow now, but I'm not gonna say it twice. I got no time. You ready? Pat K-r-o-l-l, this address, age close to 30, dead on arrival? As long as you're guessin', Ray, you mind makin' it close to 20-something? All right. 26. Attaboy. Dead on arrival. Apparently strangled sometime between midnight and 5 a.m. No robbery. No liquor. Employed as a waitress. Venezia cafe. Look up the address. Beautiful? Hard to tell right now. I guess fair. Attractive waitress. Several important leads. That's all for now. We'll try to have the official aut, the mimeo by 5:00. You got anything, doc? Uh, well, um... It's an unusual one. Unusual. Neck, throat, unbruised. Trachea, larynx, windpipe, intact. Small pressure markings above and below lips indicate, uh... An unusual crime of passion. Unusual. Hot dog! Don't get too circusy now. One look, Ray? All right, but fast. Come here, doc. Yes? Uh, you want a good quote? How do you mean? Kiss of death. What? "This young woman," said medical examiner Roland F. Stauffer, "may have been the victim of a kiss of death." Well, no, no. I don't know. Makes you a very salty talker, a colorful character. Well, uh? Don't you want to be a colorful character? Well... All right. Kiss of death. Good. Stop! Stop! Oh, please, stop! Good morning. Guy out there got his auto horn stuck but good. Would you like a couple of eggs? What's the matter, cat got your tongue? What? Eggs? No. No, thank you. She'll be right down, she said. Thank you. If they don't fix that horn soon, I'll give a scream. Tony? Morning. Sleep terribly? Yes, thank you, and you? Quite terribly, thank you. Oh, Tony, Tony, I... I had such a bad dream. My part any good? It's wonderful to be awake again. Yeah. Yes, it is. Whatever the terrors of the waking hours, at least you can fight them. The other kind, you're... Helpless. Yes. Helpless. What is it? It's nothing. I... ohh... Is it that noise? I love it. Joys of the city. Oh, thank you. Here. They're no good today. Have you noticed how nothing happens lately? No, I haven't. I have. I have. You said it. I always agree. It saves so much time. I'll see you tonight. Wait a minute. Be a good friend and stay a while. I'm afraid I can't do either. I'm sorry. I have to get home anyway. Why? You must know. I never have to tell you: I need a shave. And thank you for the use of, um, whatever it is I used. See you tonight. Do you want to see mr. Cooley? Cooley? Yeah. Al Cooley. Al. Hiya, man. Come on in. Relax a little, kid. It's a pleasure. What brings you here? You know me. A fast buck. I got quite a proposition here. Go ahead. First, I ask you, are you interested in getting a lot of space for your Othello show? The answer's yes. Next thing: It's worth more off the theater page, right? Right. Front page is even better, huh? You know, if this is some kind of gag, I'm, uh, very busy. I can see your tongue hangin' out, Buster, way out. Come on. Come on. Well, look, I'm on this job, see, a very routine knock-off. A girl -- waitress or something, strangled. So we're listening to the hand-out, and it's no good, sordid. You know, they're no good when they're sordid. So then a medical examiner -- Stauffer -- you know him? No. Dr. Roland F. Stauffer, a pinhead. He drops something, and I catch an angle. Like what? Like he says, it could be she was the victim of a kiss of death. He said that? He said that. A very salty talker, a colorful character. I'm way ahead of you. You go for it? Me? Yes. I love space, but on something as big as this, I'd have to talk to Tony John. Why? He's a big man for dignity. This is dignity. It depends on how you handle it. With dignity, naturally. Dr. Roland F. Stauffer, The department's medical examiner, said the attractive, young waitress was a victim of what he termed a kiss of death. He likened the crime to the murder of Desdemona in a current Broadway production of Othello. That's not dignity? That's all right. What's it worth? And don't tell me 2 tickets. I would like some dough, and I'll buy my own tickets. Name it. All right. With a little help, I can keep you hot for 9 or 10 days. Make it 100 a day for as long as I can keep you riding high, and you can be the judge of when that is. Fair? Fair. If I get killed for this? If you get killed, I don't get paid. Watch yourself. I better be movin'. Can I have a look at your stills? Yeah, sure. Tony. I looked for you at the office. I'm sorry. This doggone sinus got me down today and? Have you seen this? Why, yes. Why didn't you show it to me? Tony, Tony, please. Why didn't you? Bill, please, this makes me look such a fool. Isn't there something you can do to get this? I don't own the papers, Tony, after all. Did you have anything to do with this? Not exactly. What do you mean, "not exactly"? It was some other guy's idea, but I ok'd it. I see. What are you trying to do to me?! Aw, nothing, Tony. you're makin' a thing of it. You heel! Now, wait a second. You dirty heel! You're through. I'll see to that. Well, fine with me. You get this stuff killed, or I'll? Or what? You'll do it! Do it! Wait a minute. Come here. Come on, Tony. You? Tony! Tony, in the name of... Tony! Tony. Been lives, my stomach... Being done, there is no pause. Tony. Get out of here. Get out of here, you... It was a dream. You maniac. Only a bad dream. You're part of a bad dream. Come in. Be right with you. Yes, sir? I'm a friend of Al Cooley's. Yeah. I'm Max Lasker's press agent. He's a theatrical producer. Yes, I've heard of him. Sit down. Bill Friend. That's my name. Heard of you, too. If you want me in a show, I'm pretty busy. Well, no. It's just that I've got an angle about this Pat Kroll thing. What do you mean exactly: "angle"? I think I may know who you're looking for, or, anyway, it's a hunch. You're a little late. It's all over. It is? Cracked just after lunch. Well, who? Who? Can you tell me? Sure. Joe! Some poor slob. Joe, see this gets down to the inspector. Some poor slob lives right across the hall from her. Claims he was drunk and doesn't remember the details, but we remember the details, so that's all right. Everybody wants to be a detective. I think it's all these radio serials. What was your hunch? What's the difference? That actor in your show? Well, yes. Say, you guys'll do anything to get in the papers. No. No, really, I... We checked your man. You did? Yes. Looked good, too, for a minute. Turned out he'd been out all night that night. Yes? With his leading lady. His wife. Used to be. I know. We checked the whole deal with her maid. Well, that's that. Why don't I mind my own business? Sorry to have troubled you. No trouble. Sugar? Cream? Neat. Nothing seems to improve it any. Would you rather have something else? No. This is fine, thank you. All right. How long will you be gone? Uh, I don't know. Poor Max is in a tough spot. Tony wants him to fire me, but? Well, I'll take a vacation. Maybe it'll all blow over in a little while. We'll miss you. Speak for yourself, Lady. All right, then. I'll miss you. Thank you. Bill. Yes? Oh, Bill, I won't try to explain Tony to you. It's too long, too complex, but try to understand. There is a kind of an emotional illness that comes over him sometimes like this. He's a good man, really. I know. When he acts for a long stretch of time? You know how he probes and probes, and... He seems to release feelings and imaginings that aren't his own at all, like this sick jealousy. It isn't like him. No. But why on earth he should suspect you? One reason. What? Because he knows what I feel. Bill. Yes? Bill, have you ever? No. Never a word to him or from him? But he knows, Brita. The same instinct that makes him a great actor makes him know, makes him... feel, somehow, my love for you in the surrounding air. It's time you knew anyway. I don't know what to say. Well, think of something in a few weeks. I'll? I'll be back in a few weeks. Forgive me. I don't know what I'm doing. All this tea, I guess. Good-bye, Brita. Oh, Bill. Yes? Oh... Bill. I know what to expect. I know how it is with you and him. Oh, no, you don't. We hardly know ourselves. Whenever we meet, we row. The other night, for instance, I tried so hard to make friends. It ended with a door slam. Yet in the morning, I found him here. He had come back somehow. Not the first time. He's always wandering off in his lonely way. He needs someone, but I'm sure I'm not the one. Sure. Bill? Thank you. Thank you for standing by. Good-bye, Brita. Good-bye. Draw two, John. Good. Good. Good. You speaking to me? No, but thanks a million. Had a few, huh? Mind your business. Everybody's always yapping at everybody. What a world! Nate? Bill. Listen, I, uh, I need a girl for a job. Very special. Must be about 5'4", blond, buxom, blue-eyed. You got that? Fine. All right, now, Oscar Bernard's? Yeah. You know, the wig place. It'll be ready Saturday. Well, what's the job? Well, I want to get one of these girls to look like this. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. All right, girls, sit down. Uh, I could get it any color you want. Hmm, look at these eyebrows, Oscar. Yeah. Heavylike, makes her look hard and tough. Now, I don't know, it may be the photo. Take this one? Now, here she looks kinda soft and sweet, ingenue type. Oh, well, I understudied inclaudia. No. You're letting the blond hair throw you. You can tell better by the mouth, see? Sensuous, sexy. Did you see me in the rugged path? Hmm? No. The sister-in-law? Oh, yes. Would you come in now, dear? Just have a seat out there, honey. Sandra Michaelson. Fine. I-- I do imitations. I'll bet. Now, if she had eyes like the other one? Oh, I understudied inclaudia. Fine. Let me play around and see what I can do. You think you can work something out? Oh, sure. This is nothing. Phone in the back? Help yourself. Why? It makes me bilious, that's why. Because you drink it with cream, that's why. With milk. That's why it makes you bilious. Milk. Hello, Tony. Bill. Man: Can I borrow your scissors? Fine. Oh. Oh, Tony, Forget it. Well, no, it's just that I'm leaving town tomorrow, and there are a few loose ends I'd like to straighten out with you. Well, like the drama league broadcast, and, uh, that postpiece. Yes. How about around 5:00? Frank's bar all right? Fine. See you then. Fine. Without anything, it's too bitter, like medicine. In the highest-class places, you'll see them drinking it without anything. Plain black. So how do you know it don't make them bilious? I didn't say it didn't. It's a question of habit. Captain Bonner, please. These are the earrings. Fine. Say, honey... Would you ask that new girl back there sure, and one of these days, don't forget me. I don't get up to this part of town very often. It's lively. It may be even livelier in a few minutes. What do you got against the guy? Nothing. Believe me, not a thing. I just think he's dangerous. I saw him once. It was something about coal mines. Wasn't he in that? The earth below. Yes. Yeah, that was it. He was fine. Here we go. Hello, Tony. What'll you have? Oh, nothing, thanks. Coffee? Yeah, all right. Your order been taken? No, miss. Sugar. No cream. Man: Great little juggling act you got there. All right. All right. The noise around this joint. Look, Bill, I'll talk to you later at the theater. Well? You got something there, but I'll be doggoned if I know what it is. That isn't enough? We can't seem to link it. It's a long way from here to Mulberry street. A nickel on the subway. Let's go down. Soon be over, Tony boy. Soon be over. Amen. Tired? You don't suppose they'd go home now, do you, if we asked them nicely? No. They'd want their money back. They're welcome. I just can't face it tonight. There's nothing left. Oh, Tony. Tony. Oh, you. Tony? Come on. There you are. Take a deep breath. That's good. All right. I've reached the nightmare stage. I had one the other night. It was about this very scene. Tony. It was awful! Come on. Man: Places, please. Come on, now. That's it. Don't be surprised if I don't come on. You'll come on all right. That's it. Peekaboo. Man: Curtain going up. Come on. One for the money, I'm more interested in what her friends look like, if you know what I mean. Well, uh, was just 2 I seen. One was small but chunky. She said he was a fine dancer, but? How tall? No more. Who else? Well, that old guy with the little beard I told you about. He must've been a relative, I think. No, that's not him either. Wait a minute. Make-up. Well, he might've fixed himself up. What'd he look like, the beard guy? Oh, skinny, big eyes with glasses, never no haircut. How old? This... This-- this anything like it? No, nothing like that. What's the matter? I don't know this guy, but I got a feeling I seen him somewhere before. Around the eyes, something. What about this? I don't know. Think. Wait a second. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I seen him. He came in once. Just once, late, made a date with Pat. I found out the next day. I remember because I got sore. Yeah. I'm sure that's the guy. We're getting close now, boy. I'm afraid so. Let's go. Ok. I'll get my hat and coat. Iago: Demand me nothing. What you know, you know. From this time forward, I never will speak word. Cassio: Most heathenish and most gross! Tony, as Othello: O thou pernicious caitiff! How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief that was my wife's? I found it in my chamber, and he himself confessed even now that there he dropped it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire. Fool, fool, fool. You must forsake this room and go with us. Your power and your command is taken off, and Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave, if there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him much and hold him long, it shall be his. You shall close prisoner... Rest. You shall close prisoner rest. Shall... Until that the nature of your fault be known to the Venetian state. Come. Bring him away. Soft you. A word or two before you go. I have done the state some service... And they know it. No more of that. I pray you... In your letters... That when you shall these unlucky deeds relate... Speak of me as I am, nothing extenuate... Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak of one that loved... Then must you speak of one that loved, Not wisely, but too well. Of one, not easily jealous, but being wrought, perplexed in the extreme. Tony. Of one whose hand... Like the base Judean who threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe. One whose... Subdued eyes... albeit unused to the melting mood... their medicinal gum, set you down this. Where a malignant and a turbaned Turk beat... I took by the throat the circumcised dog... And smote him... Thus! Bloody periods. I kissed thee ere I killed thee. No way this... This life here. Cassio: This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon. The object poisons sight. Let it be hid. Tony. Gratiano, keep the house... Tony. What is it? Tony. Tony... Brita. Brita, we're on. Come, Brita. No. Tony. What's up? A little accident, Steve. That's all. Don't take him upstairs. Bring him over here. Rex, call dr. Mervin, will ya? Quick. Easy, easy. Tony, what is it? Let me see. Tony, Tony, are you? It's all right, Max. We've sent for the doctor. For the love of? Why? Why? Max, this is captain Bonner. He'll tell you. The-- the call. I'm late for the call. Take it easy, boy. Rest. Tony. I'm... I'm... All right. Never better. So are you... Now... And Bill. We're all... All right. Man: Your call, Miss Kaurin. No. Go on, Brita. I'll be here. Go on. Funny the things You think about, You know? Bill... You know, way back? Yes. This, uh... An actor once, old-time actor, name of Kirby, way, way back... Famous for death scenes? Don't talk, Tony. Wait. Th-this Kirby, he'd finish, they'd shout, "Die again, Kirby. Die again." And he'd... He'd get up and bow and... Die again. Ever hear of him? Kirby? No. Oh, well, tonight... The things that go through one's head. Suddenly I thought, I hope no one shouts, "Die again," 'cause... I couldn't have. Rest, Tony. Rest. The things that go through one's head. Rex: He's on his way? Dr. Mervin. No, no. It doesn't feel bad now. Peaceful, really. It's in my mind I feel bad. Pat. That unfortunate Pat. I'll apologize to her up there. Or down there. Yeah, down there. You bet. Bill... Yes, Tony? Look out for the papers. Don't let them say I... Was a bad actor, huh? Brita... Yes. Brita... Brita, you...
