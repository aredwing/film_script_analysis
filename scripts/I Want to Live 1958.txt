We didn't bring you chicks in from Vegas to go apartment hunting. Let's go. Go, go, go. No one knows where, but we gotta go. Aaa-oh, What is this? Get outta here. - Where's the girl? - What girl? Come on out, duchess. You heard me. I said come out. What, may I ask, are you two gentlemen doing in my room? - No sale. - Let's not make a federal case out of it. Hear of the Mann Act? Transporting a woman across a state line for immoral... You drove the girl in from out of state this afternoon. Don't you think we check on those things first with witnesses? - Get your stuff. Let's go. - Just a minute, copper. Did you and your runny-nosed witnesses check who was gonna pay for the room? Me. - So, there we are. - You know what you'll be charged with? Yeah, I know. And it's a misdemeanour, no federal rap. I've been there before. - Come on. - Get your paws off. I soil easy. Thanks, kid. Don't lose this. Life's a funny thing. Compared to what? Now hear this, I wanna propose a toast to those two grand little seagulls, Peg and Bonnie. They made San Diego a port the men of the USA Pompano will always remember. - You goofed, - Pay up, dogface. That'll be a sawbuck. Where did you learn close-order drill? in the WAC? - No. - The Waves? - in Ventura. - California's exclusive finishing school. Very tough to get into, huh, Peg? I always say there's nothing like a good education to get ahead in the worid. Joe, I'd like to add a serious note. Sit down. You're rocking the boat. Here you are. I was gonna yell "girl overboard". - You can't hear yourself think in there. - I got me a three-day pass starting Friday. How about me and you go down to Tijuana? - Negative. - Why not? - I'm going on a weekend cruise. - Yeah? - How's about inviting me along? - You wouldn't fit in. I'm joining my mother and her friends on a private yacht. What are you handing me? Your mother on a yacht? My mother on a yacht, Besides, you're too young. For what? Am I still too young? Well... Hello, young lovers, hello, Don't you ever knock before entering a balcony? Guess who's here. Mac and Stewie. - From Frisco? - Mm-hm. Forward march, Bury yourself. - We finally made the bucket. - What happened? Remember that delicatessen we always wanted to knock over? - We did. - And they know we did. - Can they prove it? - They got a pretty fair case. A witness. One witness, that's all? No fingerprints, nothing like that? - Not unless I left 'em on the pickles. - So if we had an alibi... if you'd say we were with you, ten to one we'd beat the rap. - Perjury's a felony. - That's what I told them. - There's three bills in it for you and Peg. - And all your expenses in Frisco. - I don't know. - Bonnie, you never let your pals down. Come on. What do you say? OK, it's a deal. - It'll be like old times. We'll have a ball. - I can't go with this kick. - Don't be like that. They're nice guys. - Sure. I guess I just haven't got your guts. This is where I cut out. You guys, there's a party going on. Let's live it up, That's my Bonnie, Wine steward, Some liquor for my friends. Bongos away, Go, go, go, Come on, Joe. Put a head on it. You've done your time, you're getting out, so watch yourself. You're on probation for five years. Don't leave the San Francisco area or violate your probation in any way or you'll be back here quick enough. - No, ma'am, I won't. - I hope you mean it. I see one Section K juvenile morals, four vagrancy, one vagrancy quarantine, three soliciting, perjury, not to mention the two years you spent at the Ventura Reform School for Giris. As long as you're adding up the score, my mother was in Ventura before me. - That oughta be worth extra points. - I'm trying to say you do have a choice. People have managed to be fairly happy by not getting into trouble. Get a job. Maybe get married. I have been. Occasionally. Your way doesn't seem to be going too well. - Why don't you try the other? - Thanks. Maybe I will. No, Mr Thomas, I couldn't let you do that. Don't be silly, Miss Baldwin. Why not? It is a bother having just one account in San Francisco. I should open one here. San Francisco? We're neighbours. I go to Stanford. Now I claim it as a right to cash your cheque. If you insist. How's 20? Anything you say. Just make it out to cash. I'm terribly sorry. Allow me, miss. Allow me. - You in an "earn while you learn" job? - Cop. - What? - Vice cop. - Look at these, all wet. - Here, use one of mine. I feel as though I've just been through a Laundromat. I'll be right back. I don't know, Hank. Picking on a vice squad cop to kite a cheque. Not much of a recommendation for a job. - She just got in town. - How was I... - Where are you from? - Frisco. - Your occupation? What do you do? - The best I can. Maybe you can do it for me. Come here. I'll see you and I'll raise you. Your end comes to 100 and a quarter. For the month, that makes $642. - I'll put it in the safe for you. - Uh-uh. - You want it? - I'm quitting. To get married. - Young Lochinvar from behind the bar? - Uh-huh. You've been married three times now. Let's assume divorced as many. No white knight's gonna come riding through your life. That's right. There isn't space on my library card for all my names. You think as Mrs Henry Graham you'll be so rich that you can't work for me? I'm tired of it, Perk, all of it. It used to be fun, but it isn't fun any more. I go past the markets now and envy the housewives carrying out the groceries. I used to think they were stupid squares too, but... I get so tired of going out with a quarter to buy ice. OK, OK. Congratulate the bridegroom for me. Wait till you taste my cooking. Good luck, Bonnie. Lay off, - You crook, Give it here, - It's our last 10. - You cashed a cheque. - I wasted it on food. Listen to me, Hank. When I got pregnant you promised to kick the habit. I've tried, Bonnie. I've tried. But tonight... Have a heart. Just one more fix and that's it, I swear. No. - Please, Hank, for the baby's sake. - The baby, the baby. I got some rights too, It's all right, honey. Sh, sh. Look at the tiger, look at the tiger. Here, sweetie, look at the tiger. Please, honey, let me have the 10. I just wanna put it on a horse. Honest. I got a tip. I could score big. - Shut up, - Daddy didn't mean it, darling. You, you're so holy. You're worse than me. You're nothing but a no-good fancy... Daddy didn't mean it, darling. He's sick. Don't you tell him about me. Tell him about yourself. - And you got a record to prove it, - All right, As long as we're all bellied up to the bar for treats, here's something for you. I'm sick of supporting you and your habit. I'm sick of your smell, This is a real dream house I've been running, and no junkie's worth it, Take it, Go on, take it, it's the last you'll ever get from me. You mean that? So help me. I'm through. Oh. Nice to see you, Mr. Bixie. Come in out of the rain. I could evict you into jail, giving me this cheque. Calm down, Mr. Bixie. Maybe you'd like a little drink on a day like this. You don't even have an account in that bank. How careless of me. I used to. I guess I got my chequebooks mixed up. - I'll write you out another. - No. Cash. Mr. Bixie, give me until tomorrow. My husband's been away all week. I expect him back tonight. All right. Tomorrow. But after that I'm going to the police. Hello? Babs, I was just gonna call you. Course you can. Come on over. I'll be waiting. - She calls me. - Taking her along, you must be nuts. I'll go to my grave saying you're nuts. You play it my way. Maybe we'll all get out of this worid alive. I thought if Bobby and I could stay here, I might be able to work things out. Stay as long as you want. Only thing is, Santo and me's taking a powder. What's up? All I know is the police contact says we're hot. - Are the cops liable to show? - Are the cops liable to show? I wouldn't worry. Good-looking dame like you. I got half a dozen bum cheques around, a busted parole, a landlord on my neck. - I'm broke, Hank's disappeared. - And it's raining. - Take me with you, Perk. - With the baby? I can leave him with Hank's mother. How about it? if I'm picked up with Bobby, they'll put him in a foster home. I got the answer. She comes with me to Acapulco. Simple. I told you, King, I don't think Mexico's a smart idea. I don't care what you think. What do you say, hon? It's nice down there. It's sunny. I'll rub oil all over your body so's you don't get too bad a burn. It so happens I'd take a rap to avoid a trip with you. - We could have fun together. - You're not my type. I heard there was no such thing as "not your type". Until I met you. And, believe me, it's purely personal. Don't get sore, glamour boy. You can't win 'em all. Anyway, she's coming with us. I'll send the three of you postcards. You let me know which pen. Watch out, Spotter to Control. Boarding Lynwood bus. 2659 southbound. One tail With her. Over. Good work, Spotter. Control to Walker. if feasible, call intersecting streets. Let's go. Excuse me, sir. is this cross street Burgess? Yeah, this is Burgess. Royal and Burgess. That Ethel's on the ball. Mobile Three. Royal and Burgess. Wait at Royal. Take number one position. Out. Control. At destination call in all divisin one units. Destination is where she goes to cover. Read me? Cut that screamer, Ted. For once, write it the way it happens, Montgomery. Don't worry, inspector. I'll spell your name right. A tramp, but smart. Good-looking girl, too. The kind that fools you. I've seen ngel pusses who'd shoot their grandmothers in the back, and take bets on which way they'd fail. Excuse me. Getting off at Barham Piaza. Getting off. Control to Walker. Drop off. We're putting the sergeant on Graham. We wanna play safe. Don't work too close yourself, please. And on the local scene, l have a newsflash on the Monahan murder. Police announce a break in the brutal slaying of Mabel Monahan, found beaten to death 11 days ago in Burbank. Bruce King, a self-styled steeplejack, was picked up on the Mexican border. According to one source, he has given authorities several significant leads. Have you ever wondered whether... - Tomorrow we move out. - It'll be tougher to visit Bobby. Are you still on that kid? What's for chow? Champagne and winter strawberries. - You... - I'm not your maid, All right, you two. Santa Claus's workshop is finally taking a breather. What the...? I'm not the only one who doesn't pay his light bill. Get down, This is the Los ngeles Police Department. You are surrounded. We are authorised by law to apprehend you, dead or alive. Dead or alive. She was tailed. She let herself get tailed. If you wish to surrender peaceably, come out singly as your names are called, hands above your head. Come out singly, hands above your head. Emmett Perkins, come out. Emmett Perkins. We will not wait, Emmett Perkins. That is a warning. - Maybe you asked 'em here. - I'll show you the engraved invitation. Come out, John R. Santo. John R. Santo. You have 60 seconds, John R. Santo. Obey orders and nobody will be hurt, John R. Santo. Barbara Graham. Come out, Barbara Graham. Come out, Barbara Graham. Barbara Graham, you have 60 seconds. If you do not come out, Barbara Graham, We will come in and get you. We are warning you not to attempt anything, Barbara Graham. Your friends are in custody. It is over. For the last time, Barbara Graham, come out. Keep your hands above your head. You heard me, Graham, hands above your head. I won't warn you again, Graham. Get those hands up. Ed Montgomery. Give me a statement and I'll write your angle. Grrr, - Brother, - That's the one to print. - Bloody Babs, the tiger woman. - Did she confess? Not yet. They've been grilling her all night. I'm going over there now. For your own sake, Mrs Graham, tell the truth. I've been trying to, for once. - You want a lie-detector test? - I want a lawyer. If you're innocent, it can only help you. Innocent of what? What's the charge? - Could be any one of a number of things. - Like what, for instance? For instance, $251 worth of bad cheques, parolee consorting with known criminais, suspicin of robbery. - And, of course, that other thing. - What other thing? Mrs Mabel Monahan. - Ha, I never even knew the dame. - You know she's been murdered? Yeah, so was Julius Caesar. I didn't know him either. Every use narcotics, Babs? - No. - No? Your husband does. If you cooperate, maybe we can let you have a fix. There's no monkey on my back. Never has been. What's with your legs? Why are you squirming? I got a worse habit. I go to the powder room every six or eight hours. - D'you mind? - Sit down. Lousy hop-headed slut. I'd like to spread you out and stamp you into the ground. - Everybody gets his kicks someway. - We have a tough, ugly job to do. - You're making it tougher and uglier. - My heart bleeds for you. How can I help? Buy a few tickets to the policemen's ball? You're being very foolish. We're giving you a chance not only to help the law for once but save yourself. What do you mean? You turn state's evidence, tell us about the Monahan job, you walk out of here a free woman. We're offering you complete immunity. All you have to do is sign a full statement naming names - we won't even call it a confessin - and you go free. So that's why you've been playing the mama bull. You think I'm a stoolie. - No dice. - I'm sorry for you. Dumb. Just plain dumb. Right now your playmates are spilling their guts. Don't let 'em make you the patsy. You heard the inspector. The minute you sign a statement, you're off the hook. - All right, I'll name names. - Now we're cooking. The inspector, the lieutenant, the sergeant, especially you, Sarge, are jerks, But I'll say this for you, Sarge, you sweat. I'm tired of fooling around. She's the hardest cookie I ever ran up against, worse than her boyfriends. - What about them? - I have nothing for the papers yet. Bear with me. Next on your phone, Ed. She won't confess, so I'm gonna play up her vice record. Dope, prostitution, any other kick I dream up. No, I'll keep Santo and Perkins in the background. Graham'll sell papers. Of course. She's had a record ever since she was knee-high to a slot machine. I'll piece together my usual valentine. Cold-blooded sadist. Titian-topped tigress. Titian. T... Skip it. I'll have it for you in an hour. is that how you got your Pulitzer? it's Mrs Graham's tough luck to be young, attractive, belligerent, immoral... and guilty as hell. - Ever been arrested? - No. Hey, What is this, a striptease? Who do you wish to notify in case of death? Marlon Brando. How about letting me have that tiger back? He's housebroken. After I check it, it'll be placed with your property. What are you doing? No, don't, My Bonnie lies over the ocean My Bonnie sails over the sea All right, Jenny Lind. I have to look you over for scars, wounds, open sores. Turn around. Siow. Put your arms out. So look for scars. You don't have to count my pores one by one, do you? What's that? Push-button control. Looks to me like someone used you to put out a cigarette. Don't touch the merchandise. Think you're pretty hot stuff, huh? This'll cool you off. Come on, honey. You're gonna pad with me. Stone waits may not a prison make, nor iron bars a cage. But they sure help. I don't get why your kind of bail just for hanging some bad paper around town? What I mean is it's way out of line. 25 grand for a chicken crime like forgery. Unless they got something else on you. Look, hon, you keep your sympathy to yourself and I'll keep my business to myself, OK? Graham, front and centre. Something for you. - Barbara Graham? - Yeah. "Subpoena... to appear before the grand jury for the crime..." Murder? What is this? They're crazy. No, they don't. They don't pull a raw one like this, They don't pin a murder rap on me, I've done a lot of things in my time, a lot of things, but not murder, I told those cops, I know nothing about any murder, Nothing, you hear me? Nothing, Nothing, Nothing, "l Know nothing about any murder. You hear me? Nothing!" shouts Barbara Graham as she is indicted by the grand jury for the murder of Mrs Mabel Monahan, a crippled Burbank Widow. lndicted along with her are the other three members of the Monahan Murder Mob, Bruce King, Emmett Perkins and John Santo. Don't know who it is, except the name I told you on the pass. Peg. Bonnie. Of course. "Mrs Ciesliwicz." You're married. His name's Joe. He's an aircraft worker. - Any kids? - Boy and a girl. Would you believe it, I'm a real square. Thursday Afternoon Club, the Holy Rosary Society, Community Chest - the works. Me too, almost. I have a boy 13 months. And smart. - You shouldn't have come here, Peg. - Don't be silly. If the newspapers get hold of it, your husband's liable to find out. - He knows. - Yeah, but... Does he know about us, how we were? I came clean about everything, long ago. When I told him I was coming to see you, you know what he said? He said that's what friends are for. - He did? - Sure. Bonnie, are you gonna be all right? We might as well face it, I'm in a real jam this time. I'm the ball bouncing around a roulette wheel, everyone betting me to land where it'll do them good. Votes for the DA, circulation for the newspapers, promotions for the cops. That still don't give them the right to hang a bad rap on you. You didn't ask me if it was a bad one. - I didn't have to. - Thanks. You'd do the same for me if it was the other way around. It could have been, Bonnie. Believe me, it could have been. We were so alike. Stop that. You're a different person now. You have been ever since you got smart in San Diego and cut out. All the stuff I read. And I could... never read the handwriting on the wall. Is there anything I can do? Bring your boy around for a visit? No, I don't want Bobby down here. - Maybe you could go and see him. - Sure. Barbara Graham, time's up. - But I only just got here. - Visiting room closes at three. - Thanks for coming, Peg. - See you soon. Oh. What about a lawyer? Have you got one? Nothing to worry about. I'll use the public defender. No, sir. No court-appointed attorney for me. I don't want you, Mr Tibrow. Period. I want the public defender. I'll do the very best I can with the $500 given me to investigate your case. 500 bucks. That's not enough to investigate who's pinching soap from a Y. With the public defender I could put up a fight, even if he doesn't have the men and dough the DA has. - Why can't I have the public defender? - Because, as I've tried to explain to you, the district attorney pre-empted him for Bruce King. Your interests are adverse. - He's a defendant too, isn't he? - But he claims you did the actual killing. That crummy, no-good... Mrs Graham, can't we spend our precious time at something more constructive? You're right. I should be thanking you instead of fighting with you. All I ask is complete honesty between us. That's a deal. Now then, you state that on the evening of March 9, you were at home with your husband and baby. But in your testimony to the grand jury, you said your husband couldn't be found. - Don't you believe me? - A jury won't. You can't simply tell them "I wasn't there." You've got to say "I couldn't have been there because here is where I was, and these are the people who were with me to prove it." I can't do that. So let's level. What chance have I got? With an uncorroborated alibi? None. There is. I'm the someone. - You shouldn't read other people's mail. - There's a lot of things I shouldn't do. Step into my office. Little Rita'll take care of the pretty lady. You really weren't there? - That's right, Your Honour. - Then you've only got one problem. You weren't with anybody some other place. I was with my husband, but he's skipped, and my son, age one. I've got a friend. His name's Ben. He could use money. Yeah? Ben's coming to see me Friday. Maybe he should try to see you too. No, thanks. It's something to think about. Look, you're in for manslaughter yourself. Why would you wanna do this for me? You're a friend in need. - Tomorrow's Friday. - Just another wild prison rumour. My friend Ben comes on Friday. - You thought about it? - Yeah, a lot. - It's an awful big chance. - It's a big rap. - One slip-up, that's all I'd need. - You can trust Ben. How about you? You know about me. Make it easy, bet it hard. Four trey, seven away. Mama's goin' home to stay. You made your point, sweetie. Yeah, I guess I did. I'm gonna need a password. This line here. - I came like water. - And like wind I go. - Ben? - That's me. Rita told you about the deal? The money part? You'll get it as soon as I'm out of here. I guess that's all right. As iong as you're OK in Rita's book. One other thing. Any physicai evidence - fingerprints, blood on your clothes? You're nuts. I wasn't even there. Will you play it straight with me? I'm going way out on a limb for you. I wasn't there. Let's get with it. We don't have much time. 30 minutes, that's all. That's long enough. Easy. There's time to run through it just once more. It was the Encino Arms Motel. I picked you up in town near your house on 54th Street. You were in a cab. I was waiting at the corner of 54th and Sunset. We went out to the motel and we... Poor Aunt Maud. But she shouldn't use a mustard plaster. I guess so. All right. We went out to the motel... And we registered under the name of Mr. and Mrs. J. Clark. We stayed till seven o'clock the next morning. In cabin 20. Then you took me home afterward. If they ask me why you've kept quiet until now... I'm married, but now I see it's a matter of life and death... It sure is. - Nothing better go wrong with this. - Don't worry. Where were you that night, really? I've gotta know. If someone saw you where you really were and they show up at that trial, where does that leave me? - Nobody saw me. - How can you be sure? - You're not even sure where you were. - I'm sure but I can't prove it. If I could, I wouldn't need you, would I? Suit yourself. Much as I'd like to save that gorgeous hide of yours, I just can't take that kind of a chance. - We'd better forget the whole thing. - Come back. Yeah? You got something you wanna say? You've really got the hammerlocks on me. - What do you want? - You were there? - Is that all you'll believe? - It's easy to believe and I wouldn't worry. - I'll double your money. - Oh, baby... Ben. - Have it your way. - You were with Perkins and Santo? If you were, it's OK. It'll be my story against Bruce King's. - You were with them? - All right, all right. I was with them. Then from here on in, you just relax. You're a cinch to beat the cyanide. May it please the court, counsel, members of the jury, we will prove that on the night of March 9, 1953 King, Santo, Perkins, Barbara Graham brutally murdered Mrs. Mabel Monahan, a crippled widow, 61 years of age. You will see why they needed a woman to gain admittance to the Monahan home. We will show you how they searched every nook and cranny of her house, looking for a hidden cache of money. And, in conclusin, District Attorney Milton cries "We mean business." "You members of the jury swore you had no scruples about the death penalty, even though one of the defendants be a Woman." "So now I say to you, invoke the extreme penalty. Let justice be done." You arrived in front of the Monahan house, it was dark, Santo tells Barbara Graham "You go ahead in." You see her enter the house. Then what happened? After Mrs Graham entered the house, Santo and Perkins insisted I follow. - And did you? - About a minute later. When you went in, what first attracted your attention? Mrs. Graham was striking Mrs. Monahan in the face with a gun. - In the head and face. - In what position was Mrs. Monahan? She was standing up. Mrs. Graham had her by the hair with her left hand and was striking her with her right hand. - Then what did you do? - I told Mrs Graham to cease hitting her. I put my hand in the way. Mrs. Monahan collapsed. And then? They tied Mrs. Monahan up and searched the house - Santo, Perkins and Graham. And me. - You may examine. - Don't let him get away with that. Tear him apart. Was an offer made you by the district attorney's office to testify at this trial? - It was. - Would you state what that offer was? Mr. Milton told me that if I were to tell the truth, he'd ask the court to dismiss the case against me. That's the reason for the testimony you have given? - No, sir. - What is the reason for it, then? - To bring justice. - To all concerned, including yourself? You feel it is justice for you to be released and perhaps the others condemned? I do. Mr. King, you testified earlier that Emmett Perkins gave you a gun about five minutes before you reached the Monahan house. - is that correct? - Four or five minutes. If you did not intend to participate in violence, even if you were there only on - how shall we say? - your missin of mercy... Objection. He's characterising the testimony. Sustained as to the last phrase. Mr. King, pray tell why did you take the gun? You know something? I've often wondered myself. That sure rocked the jury. Look at 'em. As the trial of Barbara Graham goes into its third day, the nationwide interest in the fate of the Queen of the Murder Mob mounts. Tonight, the police have been tipped off that there's a gangland plot to spring her. Extra precautions will be taKen in court tomorrow. Leave us in, pops. We wanna see Babs. Go home. Ain't you kids got nothing better to do? Your mother wears army shoes. Bonnie? - Hi, Peg. - I saw Bobby this morning. - How is he? - Wonderful. He'll be walking soon. I've gotta see him take that first step. - You will. You will. It's going fine. - Yeah, sure. I just haven't had my innings yet. - Mrs Graham, I'm Ed Montgomery... - I've seen the name. - Who's she? - Some autograph hound. Me too. How about signing an exclusive interview? I'll pay. OK, Scoop. Here's your first instalment. "Bloody Babs shuns press." Please remain seated and come to order. The court is again in sessin. The record will show the jury, counsel and defendants present. You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. Our next witness will be here in a moment. He's just outside. Hey. - That's my man. - Who? It's Ben. Ben, the one I told you about. Raise your right hand. That's the fella who was with you at the motel? - That's my witness. - Your witness? He's just been called for the prosecution. But that's Ben Miranda. That's my alibi. - State your name, please. - Benjamin Miranda. - What is your occupation? - Police officer for the city of Los ngeles. Some time before today, were you given a special assignment to work on the Monahan murder case? - Yes, sir. I was. - What was that assignment? On August 7 I went to the county jail for a meeting with Mrs. Graham. Was this meeting at Barbara Graham's request? They crossed me. Both of them crossed me. - That dirty, stinking little tramp. - Shut up. At the time and place you first saw Barbara Graham, did you give her some kind of password? - Yes, I did. - Can't you do something? - I'll do something. - What was the password? Your Honour, may we approach the bench? You may, Mr. Tibrow. May it please the court, I have repeatedly warned my client against deceiving me in any way. But I have been deceived. I've been lied to. I've been misled. For the record, I ask permissin to withdraw. I'm sympathetic with counsel, however since no person could be better qualified than the attorney who has proceeded in the case so far, the court does not feel that it should relieve you. Just so the court understands my position. It does indeed. Proceed. Read the last question, Mr Reporter. Question: what was the password? I came like water and like wind I go. lt'll be my story against Bruce King's. You were with them? All right, I was with them. Then from here on in, you just relax. You're a cinch to beat the cyanide. Those are the words echoing through the courtroom at the trial of Barbara Graham. A written transcript is used in court for the prosecution, but you are hearing the actual voices as originally recorded on the wire inside a tiny Minifon like this, Which Miranda concealed on his body during his rigged prison meeting with the alleged murderess. It's all taken down on the miniature recording device: her desperate attempt to establish a false alibi, her faltering admissin she was at the scene of the crime. The flaming redhead finally crumbles into a shattered, frightened woman. She is led crying from the courtroom after the brutal sessin. Curious onlookers, photographers and reporters crowd around her. - Have you anything to say for TV? - I'm innocent. What about the testimony of Bruce King and Police Officer Miranda? I'm completely innocent. I was home with my family that night. They'll all die violently. The spies, the liars, all the ones who want me dead. - I'm innocent. - Do you swear it? I swear it. I swear it on my baby's life. May God strike him dead if I'm guilty. And what happens to Rita, the blonde prison siren, the inside girl who so invaluably aided the police, while herself serving time for manslaughter?. Her sentence is suspended and she is released on probation, as the woman she helped entrap takes the stand tomorrow to fight for her life. Now, despite what you told Mr. Miranda, you claim the truth is that you were at home with your husband? So help me God. And yet you made no effort to contact your husband, while you went to great lengths to make use of the services of Mr. Miranda? - The same goes for you. - Just answer the question. I wrote Henry one letter while I was in the county jail and I never got an answer. Did you say anything about being with him on the night of March 9? - You're hesitating, Mrs. Graham. - I'm trying to think. You do that. May the record show that I have here a letter addressed to Henry L. Graham, postmarked May 20, 1953, and stamped on it "Mail Censored, Los ngeles County Jail". I will ask that this be marked next in order for identification. So ordered. People's exhibit 73. I ask you to read this letter and tell us whether or not you wrote it. That's her husband. Henry L. Graham. Thank God, I will clear the courtroom if there's another such outburst from anyone. Proceed, Mr. Prosecutor. Did you write that letter to your husband, Mrs. Graham? Yes, I did. Did you say anything about where you and he might have been on March 9, or whether you were together or anything about estabiishing your alibi? No. I offer into evidence this letter marked exhibit 73. Accepted into evidence letter marked exhibit 73. But I remember now why I didn't. I wanted Henry to come and see me. You also asked Mr. Miranda to come and see you and testify falsely that he was with you. I didn't exactiy want him. I just felt that I had no other choice. You told him that you were really with Perkins and Santo that night. I kept telling him that I wasn't at the scene of the crime. He acted like he should insist I was. And I thought "This is my last chance." "I can't prove where I was, and if he walks out on me, then I won't have anybody." I didn't know what to do, which way to turn. Just respond to the question. All I could think was I couldn't prove my alibi and I was gonna go to the gas chamber, and I was desperate. - Mrs. Graham... - Have you ever been desperate? - Do you know what it's like? - Mrs. Graham, - Your Honour, I move that be stricken. - So ordered. - Mrs. Graham, you have to be... - I know. I'm sorry. I know. Proceed. Mrs. Graham, perhaps one of the reasons you were so desperate during this time was that you knew you were already on probation. - I guess I still am. - From where? San Francisco. Of what crime were you convicted? You're hesitating again, Mrs. Graham. Of what desperate crime were you convicted? Perjury. Barbara Graham. He's here. - How's the Dior? - Elegant. Hey, tell him to come up and see me sometime. You have permissin to see him in the attorney's room. That's swell. - I've seen him, Barbara. He's a doll. - Thank you, ma'am. - Ask him if he's got a friend. - I'll do that. Don't cry, honey. Here she is. Give your mama a kiss like I showed you. Sweetheart, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry. - Peg, what happened? - It's the cameras. Why don't you be decent and give us a break? Oh, Mommy missed you, sweetheart. Mommy missed you. Tell us, Barbara, how does it feel seeing your baby, knowing that you face the gas chamber? How the hell do you think it feels? Damn them, Damn them, Damn them, - Get your mitts off, - Come on. Damn you, Damn you, Damn you, Damn you, While there are certain practices I don't think police officers should indulge in, in this instance I see no grounds for criticism. Motion for a new trial is denied. I appeared for the motion for new trial only since Mr. Tibrow is taken ill. All right, Mr Matthews. You'll be relieved of further responsibility in this case. Thank you, Your Honour. The defendant is remanded to the custody of the sheriff of Los ngeles County, to be delivered by him to the California institution for women at Corona. It is the judgment and sentence of this court that Barbara Graham suffer the extreme penalty, to wit, the death penalty, and that said penalty be inflicted within the walls of the state penitentiary at San Quentin, California, in a manner and means prescribed by iaw, to wit, the administration of lethal gas until said defendant is dead. Bring her over here for TV, boys. Please step aside. I hear your husband wants to change his story. - Give her a break. - You didn't. You just dropped her. - Any comments on that? - From what I read, she ain't my type. Big boy like you. Maybe you shouldn't believe everything you read. - Have you anything to say? - How about it? A short statement? Yeah, Babs. Why so quiet today? I wanna thank the gentlemen of the press. You chewed me up in your headlines and all the jury had to do was spit me out. You're all invited to the execution. That's only fair. You led the pack, Montgomery. Bring your wife. She'll enjoy it. For once how about a statement from you? Are you satisfied now? It looks like a college. Yes. in fact, the giris at Corona refer to the grounds as a campus. Rah-rah-rah. This place is a big improvement over some of those menageries I've been in. - Every dress different. - Because no two giris are alike. We want our giris to walk tall, with their heads up. - Hi, Barbara. - Hi. She knew me. Guess I'm sort of a - what do they call it? - big man on campus. This is your room. Here we go again. Just show me where you keep the hammerlocks and I'm all set. We have to put you in isolation because of your... Death sentence? First time I ever heard it was contagious. Sorry, Barbara. It has to be this way. I probably wouldn't have made the team anyhow. Never have yet. - Is that Shelly Manne? - Yeah. You like him? He knocks me out. - Are they electrocuting somebody? - Two minutes to lights out. - Gotta scoot. - So long. Good night, Bar... I'm sorry. You can't wear that here. Why not? It's too... provocative. Provocative? There's nothing but dames here. Not a man within miles. And I've got these for a chastity belt. Oh, boy, would I love to have somebody to provoke, It's very foolish to make trouble on your first night, Barbara. I'd advise you to wear the nightgown we've provided you. - Well? - OK. OK, I'll take it off. But I won't wear your burlap job. I'll sleep raw. Well? Cover yourself. She refused to take a lie-detector test. She wrote Tibrow she wants to take one now. Now she does, as a last-ditch gamble, but she wouldn't risk it before. - Could be she had other things to hide. - Probably quite a iot. There's something about her. When you meet her... Hello, Mr. Matthews. How's Mr. Tibrow? Better, but still in the hospital. He asked me to reconsider taking your appeal. I want Mr. Palmberg to talk to you. Then I'll decide. Hello, Barbara. Sit over here, please. Carl is going to make some tests on you. He's a psychologist and a criminologist. That's his probiem. I don't like my mother. I never knew my father. Where's your hammer? Sky, blue, Monday, wash. - How's that? - They're responses to the word test. - All right, Al, I'll see you later. - Oh. Sure. - What's the book? - Poetry. There was a young lad from Japan whose verses they never would scan When he was asked why He said with a sigh "Darn it all, I just can't help trying to get as many words in the last line as I can." - We might get along. - I hope so. I'd like to start with a Rorschach test. inkblots. They'll tell you what's on my murky brain. Right. Go ahead. What do you see? A rain cloud. Bobby. This one looks like a bed. - What about her, Carl? - She's totally amoral. A compulsive liar, with no regard for law and order or the conventions of society. - You must have been reading my stuff. - I think you should take the appeal. - What? - I think she's innocent. Why don't Santo and Perkins speak up? What have they got to lose now? The only cure they can think of for the cyanide. Come again? They believe in the end her sentence will be commuted. A young, attractive woman, a mother. If you don't execute the killer, how can you execute the ones who stood around? That's why they decided to keep her out front and say that she did it and why they're gonna keep her there. - That's just your own opinion. - Just my own opinion, Montgomery. Unfortunately, I can't print it and make it a fact. There's the reverse. The state has to gas her if they wanna get Santo and Perkins. I'm convinced she couldn't have done it. She has a positive aversin to violence. Physical violence, not emotional. Forgery, perjury, vice are her crimes. They're not crimes of violence. They're the crimes of those for whom violence is impossible. - Also she's left-handed. - I never noticed that. No, I didn't see it mentioned in any of your articles. Bruce King testified that the gun was in her right hand. You can't use that in an appeal. That evidence was availabie during the trial. You didn't bring me out here to tell you how to appeal, only whether. - We shall have to... - What do you mean, we? Even if I take it, there's no money for an investigation. - Besides, in your present state of health... - Stop interrupting. We're gonna have to develop a great deal of new evidence. That's my job. You'll translate it into your incomprehensible legal prose. But evidence and jargon alone will not save the lady. That's where you come in. The press created the climate which condemned her. Change that climate. Whatever gave you the idea that I'm on your side? - You're here, aren't you? - To get a story, that's all. You could have concocted your usual story without making the trip, so it strikes me you already had it in mind to change your point of view. - I'm not sure what I had in mind. - I am. You're like a man looking for a hat that's on his head the whole time. Maybe, but at least I haven't lost my head yet. But today, Peg, things are looking up. Mr. Matthews has taken my appeal. There's a man with him, a Carl Palmberg. I can't describe the effect he has on a person. But there, that's it. I'm a person again, not a condemned person. You can imagine how upset I am, Al, that after all our efforts, they positively refuse to give me a lie-detector test. Surely by now there's some word on my appeal. The suspense is killing me. Ha-ha. I guess you're beginning to realise What an impossible client I am, especially for a nonpaying one. Could be my upbringing. Another thing, Carl. Thank Montgomery for his latest article. The interviews are beginning to pay off. I don't Know what's making him change toward me, but he sure seems to have. Most important of all, though, please, please, please, Carl, bring me definite news about my appeal or I'll go insane. Please, Mrs. Graham, you must sit still You ain't got rhythm, Doc, that's your problem. My trouble is 15 other appointments today. These inlays take time. Pretty funny, putting in gold inlays when they've already got cyanide eggs marked with my initials. - Such talk. - Barbara. - Carl. - I'd like to talk to Mrs. Graham. It's all right. Don't just stand there. Give. Your appeal has been denied. Did they set a date? December 3, but Al put in for a stay of execution. No, I don't want any stay. If you can't get my sentence commuted, then don't get me a stay. - At least it'll be over on December 3. - Barbara... You heard me, I can't stand it any more, I can't, Barbara... Oh, Carl, what am I gonna do? You're gonna get your teeth fixed. Come on. Bad dreams again, Barbara? Go away and leave me alone. - There's your mommy. - Bobby, Sweetie, Bobby, baby, baby. Mommy's so happy to see you. How is she? With four days left, how would you be? You're such a big boy now. You must weigh at ieast 25 pounds, I bet you. Yeah. You remember how we used to play Wibbleton to Wobbleton? This is a game we used to play every night. And here we go. From Wibbleton to Wobbleton is 15 miles. From Wobbleton to Wibbleton is 15 miles. Do you like that? See, Peg? He remembers. OK, sport. Here we go again. From Wibbleton to Wobbleton is 15 miles. From Wobbleton to Wibbleton is 15 miles. From Wobbleton to Wibbleton, from Wibbleton to Wobbleton, from Wibble... Come along. Let's get some ice cream. No, no, you mustn't. Peg, anything but losing him. Maybe I could stand it if it weren't for losing him. You won't. Sometimes I think everything inside me's gonna bust wide open, and I feel as though somebody's pulling out my guts with their bare hands. I never should have had him, Peg. Even if I do miss the gas chamber, I'll... I'll rot in prison. I'll only cause him to suffer by staying alive. I'm glad I'm gonna die. Barbara. Barbara, listen to me. You've been granted a stay of execution by the United States supreme court. Oh, God. Oh, God, If I'd Known you were in the hospital, Carl, I wouldn't have sent that last silly letter. I shouldn't have anyhow, but waiting two months for the supreme court to review my petition has been a strain. I've been lying here thinking about What you said on your last visit. I do want to live, Carl. Life does seem very dear to me. I want to live, and you're my greatest hope. I can't believe it. Carl dead. We were counting heavily on his investigation. He didn't leave any notes on his new stuff. it all went with him. - Everything went with him. - Don't say that. You've got a lot going for you. Al Matthews, those committees. And me. That isn't what you came to tell me, Mr. Montgomery. Yeah. The supreme court has denied your petition. What's the new date? June. June 3. Yesterday I found two grey hairs. Not bad, huh? Only two. You've still got a coupie of legal shots to fire. Al is in court right now. I'm making a pitch to the governor's clemency secretary. And the paper's doing an editoriai in favour of commuting your sentence. Why not? Win or lose, I sell a lot of papers. Yeah. Barbara, I... Barbara, what I wrote about you during your trial... - The way I feel now... - No. This is a hell of a sendoff you're giving me. Everything but confetti. Here in the Southland, today marks the beginning of the end for Barbara Graham. Our newsreel cameraman catches her leaving Corona, on what may be her last trip anywhere. As I watch Barbara enter the car that will speed her to the death cell, I think how little she looks like a condemned murderess Who will lead off California's first triple execution. More like the pretty girl who a long time ago took the wrong fork in the road of life. Thoughts like these discouraged me from crowding in with the usual questions. - Still think you have a chance? - What'll you wear tomorrow? But, even now, hope eternal rides with her. At any time before her scheduled appointment at the gas chamber at 10am, the courts or the governor himself may yet decide to halt the execution. Here she comes, - Wanna see her with me? - Five minutes with Perkins is what I want. - Five lousy minutes. - He's refused you. - Why are you so sensitive to his whims? - It's his last night too. It doesn't have to be Barbara's. He could clear her. Will you stop giving me a hard time? Any execution is tough on the prison, but with a woman in the death house... Tell Perkins I'm standing by. All night if necessary. Yes. You can wait here, but please lay off the pressure. - Hello, Barbara. My name's Barbara too. - I'm Mrs. Graham to you. - Whatever you like. This is... - Let's skip the introductions. - This isn't a garden party. - I would get someone like you, fat-stuff. - Now, now. That's the wrong attitude. - Sign her over on the DW, please. I wish you luck, Barbara. We all do at Corona. This is your cell. You take the first watch. I'll start the coffee. And turn off that schmaitz. Might as well get into something comfortable. - You'll be more comfortable in these. - What's eating you? You'll have to undress so I can give you a complete shakedown. You won't find anything hidden on my body. If I was gonna kill myself, I'd have done it a year ago. I'm sorry, but we have orders to follow. - No, - Mrs. Graham... Get this straight, Miss Bedpan. Nobody's gonna go pawing over me. I'm through with all that stuff. Now get outta here, Leave me alone, - Don't get fresh with us or we'll... - You'll what? What can anyone threaten me with now? All right to come in? it's the warden. Yes, sir. Do you have a cigarette for me? - That's a switch. - Thank you. We'd like you to be as comfortable as possible. Do you have any requests? I wanna see my iawyer the minute he gets here. That's all that counts right now. - We've already arranged for that. - Thanks. - You haven't heard anything? - No. One more thing. - The gas chamber... - There's no use dwelling on that. Just hope for the best. It's right around here someplace, isn't it? You can order anything you like for dinner. I don't feel like eating. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll retire. Yes, of course. - Warden? - Yes? Don't forget to call me at 10. - Warden? - Yes? She refuses to let me examine her. Must I? All right, all right. Forget it. Very sharp. I mustn't disappoint my public. I can just imagine what those papers are gonna say. "Bloody Babs spent her last night decked out in lounging pyjamas of her favourite colour - flaming scarlet." That's what they always call red when I wear it. Or any other colour, I'll bet. Would you like some coffee, Mrs. Graham? Yeah. Barbara. My name is Barbara too. Come on, come on. They sent some dinner over for you anyway, Mrs. Graham. - Take it out of my sight. - You should keep up your strength. It doesn't come from the belly. Uh-uh. - We agreed not to count the hours. - Sorry. - Where's that lawyer? - He'll be here. He'd better. He's liable to lose an important client. It's Father Devers. - Hello, Barbara. - Hello, Father. I'm glad to see you. My, my. I suppose those are what is known as the hepcat's pyjamas. - Yeah. You dig 'em? - The most. I don't know why I should feel so upset. - I'm not afraid to die. - Of course not. You know, I think it'll be rather nice to come face to face with the one person in all the worid who knows I'm innocent. None of us are wholly innocent or guilty in the eyes of God. I meant Mrs. Monahan. - I brought you this, Barbara. - Thank you, Father. What a lovely going-away present. St. Jude. Saint of the impossible. - I'd like to go to confessin, Father. - All right, Barbara. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. - Gerry Mulligan. - Could be. I know all of his sides by heart. Flaming scarlet. - Now they'll announce it. You'll see. - Want me to relieve you? A KLlG special news bulletin. Four couples have made overtures to adopt the three-year-old son of Barbara Graham, Who, barring an eleventh hour reprieve... Shut that thing off, Those crumbs, - What right have they got to take my boy? - They only meant... I don't care what they meant, What time is it? Never mind. Just tell me what day is it - Thursday or Friday? It's Friday. Mr. Matthews, here to see Mrs. Graham. Now you listen to me. Nobody's gonna adopt my kid, - Where did you hear that? - On that radio. - Pay no attention. That always happens. - Not to me. It's all been arranged as you wanted. Bobby stays on with his grandmother. - You swear? - I swear. Things look good. I flied that writ in the federal court. Got the clerk to open the office for me. The judge is studying the petition now. - And? - I'll argue it first thing in the morning. That's exactiy what I wanted. Keep as much pressure on him as possible. Just this once, I wish it wasn't ladies first. Montgomery's sticking around trying to get a statement from Perk to clear you. An exclusive statement, I presume. He's wasting his time. There's a good chance of getting the order switched. If Perk and Santo have to go first, they might just break down. Wanna bet? I still have a couple of rabbits to pull out of the hat, so keep your chin up. The governor turned down your plea for clemency, but he might see me in person. No. Anything in the courts, OK, but don't beg for my life. - Barbara... - Don't beg for my life. - Deliver this for me. - You'll have to clear that. He knows. What are you trying to do, teach my lawyer the law? Keep it there. See you around, mouthpiece. Here. Sit on this. That floor must be getting hard. Sure you don't need it? Thanks. You don't have to stay up all night yakking with me. - Tell fat-stuff to relieve you if you want. - No, it's all right. "lMusic All Night"l continues after the late news. - Off he goes. - The head basketball coach of Hampton... There. Leave that. There's lots of longhair music I like. Me too. Sometimes I find it very relaxing. - You got any kids? - Two boys, three and six. What kind of a guy is your husband? Right now I'm serving him with divorce papers for desertion. I don't believe in divorce. I'm separated. The way men are these days, that's about the only way you can live with them. No. My Henry was a wonderful husband. He brought home flowers or candy. He was always giving me money to buy things with. And talk about doting fathers. No sacrifice was too great for our boy. No, I've got to admit... I had an ideal marriage. Then what happened? Sorry. I didn't mean to be nosy. That's OK. I left my husband because I was holding him back. He was up for a vice presidency in the bank where he worked. I was afraid he wouldn't get the promotion because of me. For a job like that they consider the wife as carefully as they do the husband. I guess they would. - Don't you think you should rest? - I don't wanna rest. It was a very big bank. You'd know the name if I told you. Come in. - Morning, Mrs. Graham. - Morning. Hot fudge sundaes for breakfast. What won't I think of next? They're scrumptious. Let me tell you about a champagne breakfast we had once in Vegas... It was in the back room the whole time. It never rang once. Maybe it will. Gas chamber. Phone check. Ring back in 10 seconds. OK. Is the warden's direct iine to the governor open? Check. Remind the others to stop all outgoing calls at nine. I know they know, but tell 'em again. Now get me Western Unin. Western Unin, this is San Quentin. Give me a time check, please. Thank you. - We're three seconds slow. Record it. - Right. Wish we couid give her the benefit. - They're awake, but they won't see you. - Did they say anything? Santo said he'd managed to stay alive so far by keeping his mouth shut. Those two are the dirtiest, slimiest apes... Agreed - what was she doing shacked up with them in the first place? Air lock test OK. What time is it? It's 9.15. Barbara, you've gotten a stay from the governor. Does this mean that I might get to iive? It's just a delay to give your lawyer time to argue in court. - We wouldn't want you to think... - That I'm not going to be executed. I like that word much better than gassed. It's all up to the courts, Barbara. Why, thank you, gentlemen. The saint of the impossible. He's certainiy got a pip to work on this time. - More coffee, anyone? - Thanks. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I understand. We'll make it 10.45. I'm sorry, Barbara. Your writ has been denied. The stay is vacated. Do I have time to dress? 15 minutes. 15 minutes. - Can I help? - No, I can do it. - Are my seams straight? - Yes. - Do I look OK? - Very nice. Those earrings are just the touch. A pair of fake earrings, that's all I wound up with. You've been swell, Barbara. You give this to your kids. - That belongs to your boy. - I suppose he's forgotten it by now. You know how kids are. - What are you doing? - The floor's cold. - What? - You'll have to take your shoes off. That's out. I look better with them on. - What's that thing? - You have to put it on. - What's it for? - Nothing to be afraid of. - It's just part of a stethoscope. - You're lying. No stethoscope looks like that. It attaches to a tube that leads to the rest of the stethoscope outside the chamber. All right, nurse. Do I have to go out there like this? Do I, Father? It's time. Her shoes. All right, let it go. Yes, sir? Yes, sir. Until further word from you. Father, why do they torture me? Why do they torture me? Gentlemen, an amended writ has been flied in the supreme court. The witnesses and press are to go back to the waiting room until you hear from me. I have told you all I know. Any time. We'll make it 11.30. Barbara, I'm very sorry. Goodbye and God bless you. I want a mask. A mask? I don't wanna look at people. I don't wanna see them staring at me. I have one. My sleep mask. Father, I didn't do it. Step up. When you hear the pellets drop, count 10, take a deep breath. It's easier that way. How do you know? OK. Ed, Ed... It's over. Dear Mr. Montgomery. There isn't much I can say with words. They always fail me when most needed. But please know that with all my heart I appreciate everything you've done for me. Sincerely, Barbara. ENHOH
