Hey, want some more? Nice to meet you. Fuck. Is that I'm carrying my purse. How can you even say that? You can't. You just can't. And how are you going to pee, girl? It's easy. You're just ridiculous. You cover me. Cover me. I bet you didn't even bring toilet paper. No, I'll just wipe myself with...! You're ridiculous. Hurry up, girl. Wait for me, girl! You're taking too long. You're wearing, like, four pairs of underwear. You're ridiculous. Shut up! I want to see how the hell you're going to pee in that. Look. Someone's coming. They're American. They're American. Say hello! Say hi to them for me. Can I have a little bite of your apple? It's just a bite. He says, how many dicks have you sucked today? - Lots. - Lots! What are your names? He says he can cook something for you if you want. To the house! Bye-bye, girls. Good night. What? Nice to meet you. But what's going on? Are you going back to work or- Bored. Bye, honey! There they are. That's Alvaro's car, isn't it? What? You did coke? Fuck, just a little. This guy said something about some drag queens? This guy tells them, "You're hungry? I'll make you some rice." Are you kidding me? What the fuck. The girls knew English? He says that San Pedro is safe because it's, like, a cactus. It's a natural drug, and it's not- Like, it's been condemned socially because of- - Hello. - Hello, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Do you have any empanadas left? Yes, sir, meat empanadas. Just meat'? Just meat. And how much are they? 800 pesos. I want an empanada. You? - I'll have one too. - Okay, me too. Do you have coffee? Is it, like, from a coffee machine? No, it's instant. Yes, one coffee and three empanadas. Thank you. He ate a seafood empanada, and, man, he puked it all back up in the middle of the highway. It was disgusting. Thank you. - Very unpleasant. - Thank you. That shit was gross. Thank you, sir. You can eat it here if you want. - All right, thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. He invited this chick to the north. I thought he was kidding. Hello, excuse me. Where is the town square? The town square, where is it? - The town square? - Yes. Further up. Further up? Right, thank you. Hello. Do you think I can fit here? Yeah, right here. How are you boys doing? Do you have a cigarette for me, honey? Of course. Here it says, like I told you before, that you're going to do well, that you're going to be happy. Are you in a relationship? Are you working? No, no, not that, see? Not that. No, no, no. Not that, money. Money. You can't eat with that. She has to pay! She has to pay! You're crazy. You're crazy. Stop, stop, stop! What happened? What happened? Can you explain to me what happened? But she gave you a drawing. She's an American. She doesn't have any Chilean money. Don't bother her anymore. Sorry about the disturbance. That girl and that blond. - Are you okay? - Yes, yes. Yes? Do you have any fresh lettuce? On the beach! Ma. Do you have toilet paper? What do you prefer? Pisco? Pisco, whatever, man. Whose stuff is this? - Hello. - Hello, good night. Hello. There's no problem with us being five, right'? The room is for four people only. You'll have to figure it out yourselves, all right? Okay, good night. Sleep well. Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. Good night, thank you. You're the youngest, and there's no way I'm giving up my bed. What is it'? No, give it to her, man. Out the ear? A dwarf? - All of it? - The rest of your life. All Of it. Or having a midget chase you for the rest of your life. Thank you. Can you hand me the beer? We're leaving now. Yes. Hello! Hello! Hello. - Hello, excuse us. - Hello. Can I ask you something? Okay. It's that, we're here with some friends. We want to drink some San Pedro, and we wanted to ask you if you could sell us that one over there or a piece. No. Really? Why not'? No, because it's mine. And... Are you going to drink it, or what are you going to do? No, that one is for me. Yeah, it's for me. We can pay you good money for it. Do you know where we can find some? Not around here. Almost everyone around here hides them, at least the few that have them. No, I'm not selling. I'm not selling my cactus, no. - Darn. - Nothing. Nothing, right. Bye. I'm busy. Hello! Hello. Hello, ma'am. Ma'am, could you sell us some of your San Pedro? Not the whole thing. We can pay a good price for it. My friend has-impossible? No, there's no chance you might sell us a little piece? Right, okay. I'm sorry. Thank you. What if we leave? Can I have the lighter? Hello! How are you, ma'am? Hello. Good, ma'am, and you? Good afternoon. Ma'am, hello. How are you? - Hello. - Hello. Do you think we could buy some of your cactus? Not the whole thing, but a little piece? - Please? - No. Do you think we could, ma'am? Please. I'd have to think about it. Just a little piece? I'm not sure about this, but come on in. You're not in a hurry, are you? Yes, thank you. Very pretty. Very pretty. - Very pretty. - Yes, yes. Your house is very pretty. There are some chairs if you want to sit down. All right. Thank you very much, ma'am. About the cactus, yes. I'd have to think about it. A little. Okay, there's no rush. No, yes, yes. Your house is very pretty. I like your cat. - Yes, it's a cat. - Yes. Yes, I really like teddy bears, anything like that. That's why I'm carrying this one around. He's restless, isn't he? Yes, don't pay any attention to him. He'd like to have the cactus, but... And you like the house and he likes the cactus, no? Yes. Can I show you something? - Sure. - Look. The mayor gave it to me, along with everyone else who agreed to present me with an award, which is why I take good, good care of it. - Are you kidding me, man? - Dude, check it out! What did she say? I'd stop too. Pollo, relax. Where is my sleeping bag, man? Right there. No, a green one. I don't know. The thing is that it takes, like, 12 hours to cook San Pedro. Hey, Champa, tell him to help up. Here, hand me one. Fuck, this guy Jamie is kind of getting on my nerves, man. Really? Yeah, you can tell he's really fucking excited, but whatever, man. It's the San Pedro. Just think that he came all the way to Chile for that thing. Hey, these tents are fucking ancient, man. They don't even have stakes. Made a mistake, kissed a snake. How many doctors will it take? Hey, hand me that stick. No, man, I know how to pitch a tent. Lel, come on! Come on, Lel! No, just say it in Spanish. Yeah. What I'm most scared of are people that have, like, bad intentions and not realizing about them. Thank you. Man, Champa, please translate. What the fuck is she saying? That in 2012, there's going to be a change, because it's the end of the Mayan calendar, and that her fear, finally, is that, like, humanity won't be able to achieve this change, which is a total transformation of man. The magic pebbles, do you have them? Here, Champa. Your magic pebble. Thank you. Do it, pussy. In the throat. That shit was gross. Did you drink the whole thing? But do you feel like puking? No, not yet. No. I don't know. It was really gross. But whatever. Just get ready for what's coming later. Dude, Crystal Hairy is losing it. Check it out. Yeah, but she's just doing her thing. It's not the San Pedro. It's two hours, so... Let's go, man, please. Hey, Jamie's kind of pale, isn't he? Don't be an idiot, Pilo. All right, let's not pay attention to him for a while. Man, shall we go to the water? You didn't drink the San Pedro, Pilo. No. Fuck, you fat-ass, man. I think I want a beer, man. What's Pollo doing? All right. Let's trap Jamie. Wrap him up, dude. She was, like, sad, man. What, is he going to apologize to her? Yeah. What is that shit? But it's cool, man. A bad experience. But anyway, you got to talk to those whale guys. You still had a good time.
