What if miss is also the same Bro, we have to say sorry before madam complains about us. Even otherwise, just imagine, if the Principal learns about this.. Remember, you already have two suspensions. You guys also have suspensions, right? But you have more than us. She will have a good impression only if you say sorry. Otherwise just think about it. We will be considered as drunken mischief students. Who is he? Bheeman Raghu (Actor) ln Spadikam (Malayalam film ) l'll do one thing. l'll get her number and call her tonight. lmpossible! All that won't work out. -Don't even think of getting her number! - Why is that? lmpossible Sir, you come.. Come! Er....Sir...come. Sir, You come here Sir, it's not necessary now..

Please don't complain to the Principal. Let me think it over and say. l'll think about it. Let's go.... Let's go... Super she is!! You come here. Not enough, right?? Simple! Java is very simple. And also Powerful. Very powerful. Then safe too! Java is very safe. Are you able to understand anything? Anjali, are you able to follow what l'm saying? lf not, better ask me, got it? l'm telling it to all of you.. lf your not able to follow, do ask me. -Then comes Robust! -You mean Robusta banana! lt's not the banana!

Take 25th page in your textbook No textbook. ln that, you can see a cat peeping out from the window, and the dog eating meat outside! Look Were you able to understand? l've also not understood it correctly. Let's jump to the next topic. Overriding! What's overriding? Tell me. l think he knows nothing about this subject! What's meant by overriding? Tell me. Somebody answer! George, Koya, Shambu and Suresh Principal wants to meet you. Sir, the Principal has called you too to his cabin. lf your son goes this way, then the situation would get worse. Regarding the explosion incident l actually wanted to dismiss him. And, then l changed it to 2 months Suspension only based on your promise! Last day, he missed his phone in the Canteen. Concerned people handed overthe phone to me. When l looked at his phone's Wallpaper, lt read ''GET LOST YOU DOG'' Doesn't your son have any culture? A couple of days back, for consuming alcohol in class, Malar teacher threw him out of the class. But teacher didn't tell me! Forthat, she'll be taken to task later! ln fact, this was informed to me by a student's mother! She asked whether her daughter's classmates were drunkards? Honestly speaking, l felt my skin peeling! See, look at him. When l'm discussing something seriously, look at the way he giggles! What nonsense is this!! Laughing? Here on, lf l ever see you laughing for any jokes.. Heard me..? And regarding the blast incident.... lt hasn't been proved in my son's name, right!! So, just don't try to pin up that blame on my son! Passover that credit to somebody else. And you were complaining about some Dog or Cat...on his mobile.. Sir, Those are the words in the dictionary. These words are not unparliamentary, right? And consumption of alcohol.. l too don't like it. Son, hereafter, don't enter class after consuming alcohol. And lf you want to, drink at home or in a bar. What sort of a dad are you? Are you encouraging your son to drink? We normally don't create any nuisance publicly after drinking. And l've said that to him too. And if you ever call me complaining about Dog...cat and all... then, you'll see my true nature. Aren't we sending our children here, trusting them in the hands of such extraordinary men?? Can't they reform our children if they wished?? Don't you bloody try to trouble me ever again for such petty flimsy issues! Awesome! Malar, please take care of Mr.George. Ah! Let it be like that George, come. Does anyone set a Wallpaper as ''Get lost you Dog'' lt was not me, that was Bolt who did it! Oh, l see! l too thought you've become so cheap! And l really disliked the way yourfoolish Principal complained about you. -That's why l punched him with my words -That's Good!! And your last English dialogue... You really killed it! Come...Come.. She hasn't noticed... Today, l'll listen in class properly. Now, who can give me the definition of a system? Please stand up. Who? When did you three come into class? Are you happy now? You three in the last bench! Shucks, this bench doesn't even allow us to sit. Very unlucky bench Please get out of the class. Let's go and eat Banana roast! 3 lime and 3 banana roast! One with extra sugar! Ok Sure O God! What happened? She threw us out of class because we were late, right! Ugh!! Oh! Should have come earlier if you wanted! So, now you're on her side!! Miss, l've a doubt. Dude! What you doing? Go inside and look!! Stop messing around. Class is going on. -What the hell is he doing - Shh! Shut up. Whoo! l'll howl if l want to! Be decent. What's this like school children...! Thrown out of the class! Guys, your teacher is a superfigure!! Mother , Father, Guru, and God, isn't it that way! Go.. Mother, Father, Guru and God!! You hit him for that huh? Oh!! Come on!! Don't giggle like a kid!! Stop blushing. See, this is what l hate! So what! Let him look. So you come to my class on time! -Okay?-Okay Now, you can go to class.. and you stay here. Me? Yeah, you! You can go to the class. Yeah, you can go to the classes! Going in the wrong direction Sir, Why is he... Sir, don't worry. Come You move Malar miss! l messaged you yesterday. l waited for so long. No message came back. So l called you back, an old woman took the phone. l just cut the phone. l got scared Okay, that was my warden. She read the message and said you sounded like a flirt! Flirt?! Flirt means? Rooster!! Hi Malar! How is George? He's good, sir. But a little late for class. l'll take care of him. l didn't expect this from these people. Great effort!! l never expected that you would reform them so much! Thank you, sir. Sir, did you really mean it or were you mocking us?
