A police detective investigating these heinous crimes has now gone missing. Authorities have yet to comment other than to say parents need to stay close to their teens and keep them well guarded till further notice. - Good morning. - Morning. - I brought you some coffee. - Thanks. We can be traced and tracked. Did you get any sleep last night? - No, not much really. - Uh-huh. ...no matter where you are at any given point in time. Even our soldiers out in the battlefield. Even our children on the playground. - Turn it off. - Can we trust them with it? All right. So what are you thinking? I think she should come to the office. Well, I'm willing to look at it. I just don't-- - All right. - All right. Damn it! Slow down! Hang on a sec. Stop! No! Life in the modern world has a new anxiety these days. Just as we've become dependent on our computers, they're now being stalked by saboteurs. The Federal Bureau of Investigation can hear everything you say even when your cell phone's turned off. We can 't control technology because it is everywhere. The Unabomber sent a letter to the New York Times claiming to be a member of the Freedom Club. They crashed his computer with a virus and used his own e-mail to infect everyone on his friends list. Security experts fear an all-out assault on computer systems around the globe. They're scrambling to come up with anti-virus-- I've had seven different passwords, and they got them all so far. Victims of computer fraud are wondering, why is this all happening to me? Now, I know you've heard that story about the Special Ops soldiers captured in the Middle East and tortured because he had a government-issued cell phone. Here's an interesting new statistic. Three-quarters of all cell phones now come with global positioning. The terrorists were able to track his location just because he had it on. Special Ops soldier infiltrates a terrorist camp, gets captured all because his cell phone was tapped? The legislation has given the government new powers to eavesdrop on both domestic and international-- - We're supposed to feel safe? - I believe in domestic terrorism and I think I'm being watched. As targets, we're people who contribute to the industrial technological system. At the stroke of midnight, January 1, 2000, elevators may stop, heat may vanish. Y2K hackers are ready to attack computers all over the place. Stock markets around the world may suffer some form of collapse. What is the government doing with all of this technology? With all of this information? Can we trust them with it? Do we know that it isn't being hacked and used by outside forces, possibly enemies, people who want to kill us? Hey. Hey, bitch. So whatcha doing? - Studying. - What's that? Shut up. Just kidding. God, you're such the little Miss Perfect Student, Jessie. Yeah, whatever. So, did you get a chance to ask Michael about me? No. Dude, I don't know what to say to him. I mean, we've all been friends forever, and now suddenly you like him. He wasn't exactly this hot - in fourth grade, Jessie. - Obviously. Wait. What ever happened to that Anthony dude that you met online? Oh, my God. He turned out to be a total perv. I found out he was, like, 40 or something when he was claiming to be 18. - You've received chain mail. - You should really be careful of all the online dating stuff, dude, seriously. Okay, this guy, Ghetto Pirate, just sent me a picture of his you-know-what. You attract the weirdest men. Okay. Yeah, it's official. I need to stop dating boys online. Agreed. All right. I gotta go. I'll call you tomorrow. I love you, and I will see you tomorrow at school, okay? Okay. I love you. ? It makes the world go better? ? The different sides of you? ? And in the darkest weather? That's grade school. - No, he taught me. - Johnny boy. - Hello, Mikey. - Man, what happened to you last night? Oh, come on, man. You know how my pops is with this football thing. Hey, you hear about Kevin getting that letter to Nebraska? Yeah, I heard it about a million fucking times already. Damn, man, what's your problem, man? Just relax, man, all right? What's wrong with you, man? My dad is all over me about this football scholarship. Relax. You know you're good already. Ooh. What's up, Rach? Adam dumped Heather last night. Oh, nobody gives a shit about that. Yeah, what else is new? They do that every week, right? Whatever, boys. Hey, Rachel, what is your problem? Why were you telling Mom what I was doing last night? Well, after you told Mom about what happened to me, I'll tell everybody, Neil. Oh, but I don't give a shit, okay? I was jacking off, all right? That's what I was doing. That's really funny. Yeah, fuck you, you jack off. You know what? The point is, Rachel, come into my fucking room again, and I'm going to tell Mom where you keep your box of condoms, all right? - Fuck. - Jergens, Neil. - What's wrong with him? - Hi. I don't know. - Hey, Michael. - What's up, girl? So, you ready for the game, Johnny? Of course I'm ready. What's wrong with everyone? Jeez. He's tripping today. I'll holler at you guys after class, all right? Okay. Ew, ew, ew. It's the 40-year-old fucking virgin. I'm seriously changing my phone number today. Can't say I told you so. - Hey, Jessie. - You should start... - Wow, Dante. - Hey. I will see you in class. I got this for you. Thank you. I picked it down the street for you. - It's pretty. - Can I walk you to class? - So how was your weekend? - It was good. Yeah, just working on my car. She'll be done in a couple of weeks. Cool. So do you think when you're done, you can take me for a ride? Yeah, sure. Yeah, of course, I'll take you for a ride. Privacy is something that was, at one time, considered sacred, but that's no longer the case. For instance, right now, right here, I would like some privacy with this class, but modern technology prevents me from doing that. Hey. What the hell? My phone just, like, stopped working. Better. How did you do that? Blocks cell phones for 50 feet. Oh, man. You see, there was a time when you couldn't call somebody at any time. There were no cell phones. When you went out, until you went home, you had privacy. Your messages were at your home. I have a question. Don't you think it's worth giving up some of your privacy so you can communicate with the world? That's a good point, Jessica, but what about the Internet? What about MyTube, YourSpace? Doesn't it bother you that a complete stranger can communicate with you, know what you look like, know what your favorite color is, know what movies you like to watch? All that information is out there, and for what reason? - The ladies. - Yeah, man. The ladies. Really? - The ladies. - Yes, indeed. And what do you do with the ladies on the Internet? - Everything. - Nothing. You do nothing. You see, I think your generation only sees the good side of technology. But I assure you that where there is a good side, there is also a bad side, and both are out there lurking somewhere. Okay, kiddies, let's see what we've got here. Wow, Barclay. Five hours later, you're still here, huh? Well, man, I guess you just want to die again. Come to me. What are you doing? Did you leave your computer? I'm taking all your experience points. All right, that's fine by me. Fucking Dwight, man. Go away. I have got to save my comrades. Oh, what the hell? Okay, what is this? "You've proven yourself a worthy opponent. You're the first link in the chain." Link? Okay. Well, that is fine. Cool, man. I'm a link. You've received chain mail. You've received chain mail. You've received chain mail. Yeah, chain master, I got your text. I get it. Neil, my computer froze. Can I get on yours real quick? What? What the f-- Yeah, don't bother knocking at all. Sorry to bother you, Mr. Personality. Will you please get up and move? Fuck you. Get the fuck out of my room. Neil, I was just writing an email. You're sitting here playing games. I have a social life. I have people who are fucking counting on me. - Oh. - And my computer froze. Can I just write an email really quick? I forgot. I'm sorry, but no, you can't. Neil, please, get up. - Fuck. - Just let me deal with this. - Fine. - What is this? That's a stupid chain letter. I hate those things. "Every chain has a link. Every link is a life." Yeah, please don't touch it because I'm just going to delete it. No, you don't delete these, Neil. They threaten really terrible things. Like, why take the chance? Freaks me out if I don't. Is that kind of the same thing, Rachel, as, like, Susie Joe-- she got it, and she didn't send it off, and five hours later she's dead? - Exactly. - Right. And Jessie and... Johnny and... Dante. Can you hang on one second? You're fucking sending a chain letter. - Can you get off my computer? - No, stop. - No, you're not sending-- - Neil, just let me finish this. ...you're not sending chain letters off of my account, please, so you need to excuse yourself. - Neil, fine, I'm just-- - Off my seat, thank you very much. Let me just finish this. It'll only take a second. Neil, just let me do this. Excuse you. You can leave. You can get off-- I have a phone call. That's the only reason I'm leaving right now. Oh, really? Are you sure Dante is not working out or something? Johnny's got his shirt off. You better go. If you must know, it was your doctor, Neil. He's really sorry, but, um, surgery's just not an option. There's nothing they can do about your midget penis. Oh. Well, that sucks. I guess I'll just have to fuck a midget. Rachel, you only put four people on this stupid thing, all right? Whatever. I'm going to put your name on it. Rachel Conners. There you go, bitch. A chain letter. Thanks, dick. "Break the chain, lose a life." Are you fucking kidding me? Delete. Stupid. Get the flag. Go, go, go! Come on, shoot, shoot! It's getting tight. So what are we doing? What's the essay topic? Technology and piracy. Piracy, right? - Privacy? - Privacy, privacy. You jocks can't seem to get that one right. So we have a five-page essay and a presentation, so I want it to be something creative. Do you guys have anything to contribute, or is it just me? Oh, shit. Anyway. Oh. It's another fucking chain letter, man. "Break the chain, lose a life"? That's pretty extreme, don't you think? Neil's dumb ass. - I'm surprised he isn't in here right now. - Mm-hmm. I know you got one, didn't you, Dante? No, I don't have a phone. What? Snigglers ain't got a phone? I'm just not into the whole phone movement. How do you even survive without a phone? Listen to me, you need a Sidekick or an iPhone or get you a rotary phone if you have to. I have a phone at home. They just buzz, and they beep, and they have little buttons on them, and I'm just not into it, man. Regardless, you still got one. Check your computer at home. You're on the list, Buddy. Oh, thank you. Shit. His ass has it, and you got it. Kevin got it, too, and your ass and your ass got it. All right, this boy ain't pressing his luck. I just delete them as soon as I get them. Poof, gone. Just like that. Like bam! Knockdown. All right, you guys have two minutes, two minutes to play games because I'm going to the bathroom, okay? When I come back... And then right, right, uppercut with the left. Oh, sorry. Oh, shit. Jesus, man. - You scared me, dawg. - Sorry, bro. - God. - See you out there. - What's up, man? - Hey. I heard you got a letter, right? - Yeah, finally. - Nebraska, huh? Yeah. Hittin' it hard. Find out where you're going yet? No, not yet, but my-- my pops is hassling me about it, so hopefully soon. Hey, maybe you can play for the junior college. They're going to be good this year. Yeah, well, I'm going to hit this bench over here. Do it. What? Yeah. All right, okay, I'll be home in 15, okay? Yes. Good-bye. Hey, Johnny, did you get this chain letter text from Mikey? Yeah, I got that bullshit, and then I deleted it. A little intense, huh? Ooh, you're all going to die. Lame. Delete. Bro, I gotta head out. Later, man. Have a good workout. Put more weight on there. You're looking kind of small. Fuck you, asshole. Fuck! Kevin? Kevin! What the fuck! The fuck are you doing? What the fuck? You've received chain mail. Chain letter. Junk mail. What have we got? Hey. This is bad. Looks like we've got injuries to the mouth, teeth missing. Crenshaw, his face is gone. What about over there? He must've been over there getting a drink, and wham. Makes a lot of sense the perp would blindside him. He's a big boy. Any prints from the fountain? We've got a bunch of partial and smears. We're running them through NCIC, but don't hold your breath. Oh, jeez. Coroner says the arms appear to have been snapped off, hyper-extended. What could this kid have done to bring something like this on himself? He must've been into something deep. Nope, nothing so far. Everybody said he was a pretty good kid. The coach did say something interesting, though. These chains don't belong here. No one's seen them before. That's interesting. Where's this kid's locker? I'll take you. And there was no attendant, no video camera? Just a sign-in sheet. The other kid with John signed in-- Kevin Daniels. Kids say they were workout buddies. We have officers going to his house now. You know, the odd thing is his car's still parked out in front. Good. Anybody on it? Yep, done. Oh, damn. The kid was juicing. Look at this. Let's bag it. See who called him in the last 24 hours. You got it. And let me know what's going on with that Daniels kid. We need to talk to him right away. Okay. Come on. Jessie! I hate to bother you. I'm Detective Crenshaw. I know this is a painful time. This is some bullshit. That's what it is. You were Johnny's friends, and I need your help. I hope you have some answers, Detective. Not yet. Three days, and your people don't have anything yet? That's my son in that box. Maybe you should figure something out before another one of these kids dies. It's my son's funeral. Show some fucking respect! Just a few questions. Did Johnny have any enemies that you knew about? - Anyone wish to do him harm? - No. Did anything out of the ordinary happen over the past few days? No, not at all. Well, if you can think of anything, call me or e-mail me. What's up? So, you gonna look at it or ask it out on a date? It's beautiful. Yeah. I'm glad you like it. You put this up all by yourself? No, I had help. My left and my right fucking hand. It's, uh-- It's perfect. I think it's an 11. Jessie. What happened, man? - I'm working on it. - Working on it? - Working on it. - Give me something concrete. First base, second base? Bunt. Well, at least you didn't get hit by a pitch, right? No, it's early innings. - I'm taking it slow. - Mmm. Well, when this is all done, you'll be hitting home runs, man. This is a grand slam. Oh, easily. But when this and this is all done, you'll be a fucking hall-of-famer, man. I'm gonna get those jacks. All right, man. Yes. Put this sucker up. - Hey, beers are up here. - Oh. Nothing but muscle. Hey. Hey, Jessie. How's it going? You're looking particularly ravishing today. This? This is just one of my many little projects. You want a-- You want a ride? Why don't you hop in? Take a little spin. We'll go park, hump a little bit. Oh, shit. Shit. Ow! Shit. - What are you doing? - You fucking scared me, man. There's something leaking out of the engine. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Well, we can look at it. No! No! - Hey. - Hey. When it rains, it pours. What about Kevin Daniels, the jock who's still missing? They have the same friends, and they were in the same history class. What do we know about the teacher? He was a bit strange, but he cleared. He had a solid alibi for both nights. The first night, he was with his family. The night of the Trafford murder, he had a huge faculty meeting. Now, what's up with these chains and these markings? What do you think? Has the lab come up with anything new yet? Nothing new since preliminary, but they promised us something later today. I'm Mark S. Allen. Topping today's stories, the ongoing investigation of the brutal killings of two students, with one student still missing, in crimes that have shocked and outraged Carlson, a town known nationwide as the technological and software communication industry capital. Investigators at prestigious Brickman High School still not releasing any information to the public for fear it'll jeopardize this ongoing investigation. It's been one week since the brutal slayings and student athlete Kevin Daniels went missing in an unexplained twist of violence. Today Brickman High School reopened after a few days off to let the students deal with the tragic events. Police are asking all students and parents to please come forward with any information that might help this investigation. More on that in moments. Now a look at your forecast. Can everybody sit down? We're on a short schedule, and we only have a few minutes. You've all had a couple of days off to deal with the tragic events that have touched this school community. And I know that most of your parents are going to the community meeting tonight. I know I'm gonna go because I want my questions answered. But as for this class right now, we have to get back on task. So, the midterm final is due on Monday. Okay, class is dismissed. Jessie, stay after class, if you will. I'd like to have a few words with you. Lucky you. You wanted to see me? Yes. I know that you've been through a lot lately. Tragic, terrible news. So I want you to take all the time that you need with your project. You're a very good student, and I can tell that you're not yourself. Okay. I don't think I need that, but thank you. If you should change your mind, let me know. I'm not much of an e-mail person, so just call me on the phone. Jessie, if you need to talk to me for any reason at all, call me. Okay. Thank you. Okay? You have a good weekend. You, too. Patrick Taylor heads up Internet Security Systems, a company that protects computers at the largest commercial banks, telecommunications companies and 35 federal agencies. They call themselves "Anonymous." They are hackers on steroids, treating the Web like a real live video game, hacking into Web sites and invading MySpace accounts, obstructing the lives of innocent people. Mr. Bradford! Mr. Bradford! Mr. Bradford! Mr. Bradford! Detective Crenshaw! Carlson Police! What are you doing? Who are you? Crenshaw, Carlson Police. What do you want? I'm talking to all the ranchers in the area. You mind if I ask you a few questions? You ever use a blacksmith or a metal worker out here? - Maybe even a long time ago? - Everybody does. I'm looking for the person who might've made this link. Where'd you get this? You've seen this before? I have. I don't remember where. My wife would know. Well, can I talk to her? She's dead. I'm sorry. You better go now. If you can think of anything, I'd appreciate a call. I just delete them. As soon as I get them, poof, gone. Your ass and your ass got it. All right. This boy ain't pressing his luck. Remember that creep from the Internet I told you about? A chain letter. You gotta pass it on. Come on, Rach. Rachael, it's me. I found some stuff on the Internet, and I just-- I'm really scared right now. I just need you to call me back as soon as you get this, okay? I just need to know that you're okay. Call me back. Yeah? Neil, where's Rachael? I can't get a hold of her. I-- You know what? I don't know. But I'm gonna take a crack at it. Uh, she's probably balling somebody about now. Neil, come on. I'm serious right now. This is an emergency. Okay? She might be in danger. I just called the house. Nobody picked up. Well, what do you want me to do about that? - Where are your parents? - Look, I don't know. They went to some benefit thing. Jessie, can I call you back, please? I'm knee-deep in some action here. I need to call you back. No, no, no, listen. Neil, wait. Okay, just meet me at the house as soon as you can, please? I'm going there right now, and I'm too scared to go alone. So just meet me there, okay? Please? Okay, I'll-- I'll, uh-- Yeah, I'll be-- I'll be right there. Neil? No! No! No! You got it. Listen, l-- I really don't think we need a profiler on this case right now. Yes, I am-- What's his name? Wiggins? Fine. Fine. Jessie, listen, I'm really sorry about your friend. I, uh-- I can't imagine what you've been going through. Listen, I just wanna ask you a few questions so we can figure out who's doing this. - Okay. - Now, what made you rush over here tonight? We all got these chain letters. Um... See? Who sent this? Jessie, what's going on? Rachael's dead. What? She's dead? Jessie, can you forward this chain letter from your phone? Mm-hmm. I want you to send it to this address. And then send it to me. - There's my e-mail. - Are you sure? - Don't I have to send it to four people? - No, no. - Because-- And the thing is-- - Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Just send it to me. - Taylor. - Excuse me. I want you to call the lab. Tell them I'm sending a chain letter over there right now. See if they can trace it, or if it matches anything we already have in the system. Right. Can either of you think of anything else that I should know about? Drugs, uh, boyfriends, enemies? Um, yeah. There was a guy she met online. He was an older guy. She wasn't freaking out, but he was sending her some weird stuff. - He was texting her all the time. - Okay. Ever meet this guy? No. - All right. - Okay. Okay, look-- look, that's-- that's enough. - Oh, man. - That's enough. Listen, take her inside. Take her inside. If you get any more chain letters or any suspicious texts, I want you to call me right away. Send them to me. This is Stephanie. She'll take care of you. - Jessie? - Yeah. You okay, son? No. No, I'm not okay. It's all right. It's not-- It's not-- It's not all right. - It's not all right. - Let's go, son. Let's go. I hope you've solved the mystery. Detective Crenshaw. I knew it was you because your name's on the plaques. I know who you are. - You do? - Wiggins. Profiler. - Frank. - I heard you transferred over. How do you like it so far? Big change from New York, huh? Yeah, it's-- it's different, but I'm-- I'm adjusting to it. I've known about you for quite a while. - 1996, I believe it was, - Mmm. Was the year that you broke the Browning Brother cult. That was pretty impressive. Can I ask you a question, Detective? You can ask. How'd you do it? Just instinct. Instincts. That's good. So, what do your instincts tell you about this case? These chains are key. Always chains, always the same kind. Most of them are in Evidence, but l-- I held back a few. Mmm. Yeah, a little stamp on the side. That's what you're talking about? Whatever it is, it's the key to cracking this case. I profile people, not metal. Well, somehow, it reminds me of a radical group a few years back. Hold on, hold on. Keep talking. What was their name? - Um... - Something, uh... It was about technology, anti-technology-- Antech. - That's it. - Yeah. - Okay. That's it. Antech. - Yeah. They were apocalyptic Luddites, right? They hated computers, the Internet... But that was a group, and I'm sure that this is the work of a single guy. Do you remember, Detective, the, uh, Unabomber? Uh, Ted Kaczynski, right? Went to Yale, taught at Berkeley. He was a smart guy. He knew technology, but he hated it. And if a guy is so anti-tech, why would he, uh, send e-mails to people? I don't know. Why don't you tell me? Why? Why would someone embrace something that they are so opposed to? Unless it's strategy. Fight fire with fire. That doesn't make sense. That doesn't make any sense to me. Look, I mean, look at all the good that technology has done. Breakthroughs in medicine, instant communication all over the globe. - Detective, you don't get it, do you? - Helps save innocent lives. They don't like technology. It doesn't matter about the result or the application. They don't like technology. That's it. Please, do me a favor. Allow me to take these photos for a couple of days. You know, I got one plaque in my whole life, and they spelled my name wrong. Two G's, not one. Hey, Michael, it's Jess. I've been doing some research on the chain letters. Call me back when you get this. I'm headed home now. How can someone do this? Someone's tracking us. Huh? Huh? Hey. Hey, buddy. How you doing? How do you think I'm doing? - I miss her, too, Neil. - Yeah. Yeah. So, uh-- You wanna tell me what this meeting is about, guys? I mean, you're not gonna stop any of these killings, Jessie. You send out five chain letters, and then five pop up everywhere. I know. I know. Just listen to me, okay? There's a person behind this, and I think I know what he's doing. - He's tracking us online. - Tracking us how? There's a virus that I found in my phone and in the e-mail, okay? The virus is a tracker. We all have it. That's how he knows whether or not we pass it on. That's fucking crazy. How could he know where we live? How? It's easy, okay? Everything you have is connected to a bill you pay, right? And all the companies who bill you have your addresses. It's not that hard. I never even thought about that. But why us, huh? Why us out of everybody? Because he's a fucking psychopath, Michael! Why did Jeffrey Dahmer kill people? - Why did O.J. slash his wife? - What are you saying? - What do you think I'm saying? - Guys, come on. Stop. No. This is not on you guys, all right? - Who do you think got the first message? - Who did he send it to then? Me. He sent me the message, all right? I-- He said it was a game. And I sent it to you guys. You know how that feels? You wanna know what that-- Fuck it. All right. - I'll show you what that fucking feels like. - What are you doing? - Neil, what are you doing? - I'm gonna show you. I'm gonna fucking show you what it's like to be in my fucking shoes. What the fuck are you doing? What are you doing? Give me your phone. I sent you the message. You got it. All right. It's fine. You fucking shit. - Stop! - Stop! - You threaten my life? - This isn't on you! This is on me, all right? This is on me! Everybody's fucking dead, and you pull a fucking gun out on us? - Oh, fuck. - What? - He fucking sent me another chain letter. - What? Fucking break the chain, and you will die, man. Man, he's watching us. He is watching us. Fuck you, Neil. What are you saying? Where is he? - He's here. He's watching us. - We gotta do something now. Okay, so the way this works is you die if you delete it, right? The chain letter said we had 24 hours. I don't wanna die. I'm just gonna send the fucking message to people that I hate, right? I mean, if they die, big fucking deal. - Too bad for them. - You're fucking tripping right now. - Just chill out for a second. - Hey, I sent the message to you, didn't l? Fuck you guys, man. I'm fucking outta here. So listen to me. I know how we can pass these on, okay? And then once it's over, we just have to get rid of our phones and our e-mail addresses, okay? Whatever. What the fuck does it matter now, huh? You've received chain mail. Why the fuck do you keep sending these to me, man? I'm doing everything you want me to do. I keep sending them on. Fucker! You've received chain mail. What the fuck you want me to do? I've sent off these goddamn chain letters to everyone I fucking know. You've received chain mail. Fucking relax, man. I just gotta take... I gotta take a deep fucking breath. I just gotta think what I'm gonna do. You've received chain mail. Fucking Rachael. You've received chain mail. All right. I gotta fucking-- - You've received chain mail. - I gotta fucking do something. - I gotta fucking do something. - You've received chain mail. He wants to fucking play games with me. That's what he fucking wants to do, huh? You wanna fucking play games? You wanna fucking play games with me! - Kill my goddamn sister! - You've received chain mail. Fucking delete this. Delete your fucking message, man. Why don't you come and get me? Why don't you fucking come and get me? - Jessie, what's going on? - Just forward me the chain letter. Forward it to me, and then change your number. Change your e-mail address, and never use those old accounts again. Crenshaw has it set up so that all the e-mails are going to some police computer that tracks them. I don't feel good about this. If it doesn't work, everything's gonna fall on you. Just trust me, okay? Just send it. I'll be fine. I'll be okay. Just send it. Crenshaw. Remember that link you were looking for? Oh, Mr. Bradford. I remembered. Used to be a place out on Ramsey Road. Wilson. Dead now. One of his sons went off to that war. Used to supply chains to the meatpacking plant. Plant went out of business. So did they. "They brand themselves with bar codes." Oh, my God. Come on. Pick up. Crenshaw. Oh, shoot. Crenshaw, I know these are our guys. They're an old cult that grew in the 20th century. They call themselves Technology Terrorists. They were vocal until Y2K, and when nothing happened, they dropped out of sight. They brand themselves with bar codes to demonstrate how technology destroys individual identity. Oh, shoot. - Who are you? - I'm Kevin Daniels. I'm Kevin Daniels. Ooh, you're all gonna die. Delete. Hey, man, I wanna go home. Okay, son. I'll help you. - Please! The line! - Okay. All right.

We've been trying to reach you all day. - Our security system 's been hacked. - What? The guy claiming to be Wiggins yesterday turned out to be an imposter. You're not gonna believe this, but the actual Wiggins turned up deceased less than an hour ago. We need you back at the station. Where are you? It doesn't matter about the result or the application.

And then send it to me. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. We can handle it. Hey, Jessie, it's Michael. Look, I need you to call me back as soon as possible, 'cause I'm seriously worried about you, all right? I don't know if this whole sending the chain letter things to you was a good idea. Just call me back as soon as you get this, all right? If not, I'll be there early in the morning. And we are live on the scene at the Carlson Police Department with a shocking new development in the teen murder spree. A police detective investigating these heinous crimes has now gone missing. All right. So what are you thinking? Maybe she needs more than a counselor. Jessie's gonna be fine, sweetheart. Crenshaw's gonna solve this thing. He's the best there is. And in the meantime, I promise you she's safe. Just forward me the chain letter. Crenshaw has it set up so that all the e-mails are going to some police computer that checks them. Damn it! Slow down! Damn it, Michael. Jessie! No! - Oh, God! - No! Jessie! No! Jessie!
