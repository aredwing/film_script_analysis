How unlike him to leave early. Mr. Antonio Suarez? Mr. Antonio Suarez? GAY PARADE IN MEXICO We thought you'd bury us all. Check mate! Life is cruel. What do you mean? I may know someone who can do something. REY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU WANT TO MEET HIM? ACCEPT OR DECLINE CHATTING WITH REY - Hello. - Hi, how are you? I like your photos. Thank you. What brings you to this chat room? I want to meet people. I'm so stupid. I should've said sex. I must've scared him off. You look nice. No, no, no! Surely everyone tells him that. Would you like to come to my house ? What do I say? What you doing, Antonio? Hold on, I got a good bite. Glued to a chat, as always. Sure, I'd love to! - You're going? - You think I'd miss it? We'll have a great time. I'll treat you like a king! Look at him. Oh, boy. We could propose a threesome, right? Yeah, right! This one is mine! I know we will. Give me your address and I'll head out. Look! He gave me his address! I know where it is! It's a joke. He must be stocky, hairy and bald... ...and that photo is fake or it's dangerous. You're just jealous you don't have any action. I'm on my way now! See you in half an hour. Okay, buddy, I'm off! I'll tell you about it tomorrow, okay? Okay. Be careful! Don't stay up to late! Good start. Who is it? Hey, I'm Antonio! We met... - Hi. - Antonio. You're cuter than I imagined. - You are... - Hey, none of that. Come on in. That's it, handsome. 'Hey. Tono! - What's up? Why'd you leave school just like that? What about your classes? I only came to do an exam. Hey, why all the mystery? You said you'd tell me about the chat guy. Later, okay? Hey! He hit you! It was nothing. But he hit you? Treat me to coffee, why don't you? It's nothing serious... ...but that bastard went too far. I told you it was too good to be true. It was true. He was so hot... -...but very crazy. - A punch is nothing... ...but having sex without a condom... I couldn't do anything. I got to his place... ...and he started saying such beautiful things. He gave me martinis or something... ...and before I knew it, it was all over. He made me bleed. That bastard really hurt me. Man, what can I say? Go to the police and say you were raped? No, I just want time to pass by and forget it. I promise I'll never leave with a stranger again. That's what they all say. As soon as they forget... Don't be a pain! You've done it too. Yes, but I've never gotten hurt. Will you get a blood test again? Yeah, but you know how this is. I have to wait three months to get an accurate result. HIV-AIDS POSITIVE He infected me. That son of a bitch infected me. I'm sorry, I'll give you some forms to fill out... ...and you can begin treatment immediately. What will you do? Nothing. - I can't kill myself. - No, of course not! I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. It wouldn't help anyway. I'm just trying to make you feel better. I'm your friend. I don't want you to... I know, I know. I don't need anyone's pity. I don't feel pity for you! We'll talk later. Hi. Do I know you? No. There will come a day in which humanity... ...will have withered like a flower... ...and the old sun in outer space... will only be charcoal. There will come a day in which the cold world... ...will be a morbid silence. A great shadow will surround the sphere... ...where there won't be any more springs. The dead Earth, like a blind eye... ...will always keep blinking, but in the dark... ...alone, in silence, without a prayer... ...lonely, with its favorite creatures... asleep and tired in its bosom. A mother who marches with the poison... ...of her dead children within her. Not one city stands. Ruins and debris will be held over one's shoulders. From up above, the mountain is black... ...and will be seen with a withered expression. Won't the sea be but a hard block of ice? And so, anguished with its hardness... ...alone it will dream of its ships and waves. It will spend years looking for a boat... ...that will ripple its surface. And there, where it meets land... ...it'll dream of a beach under the moonlight... ...and it will only be but that wish... ...for the moon will be another mausoleum. In vain, it'll try to move to swallow man and rocks... ...or hear the unnerving scream of a shipwreck. Nothing will be left. From pole to pole... ...In one blow, the wind will sweep it all. Voluptuous housings and miserable shacks... ...dark caves and refined cathedrals. Blacks, yellows and browns. Whites and half-bloods. They will meet underground and ask forgiveness... ...for all their wars. And holding hands... ...they'll go around the Earth once... ...and they will cry an echo of lament... ...for so much unnecessary suffering. The Earth was a garden full of roses and cities... some next to rivers, others near forests. Between them, fine rails were placed... ...that were supposed to represent hope. The country flourished. Everything was merry and fresh as a meadow. Instead of understanding... ...that we were fighting, brother against brother... ...women were slandering each other... ...and entrepreneurs were populating the world. We were all against he who was good... ...we soiled him and filled him with poison. Now, white bones, we surround the Earth... ...and humanity's ame, at its feet... ...has finally gone out. Listen to that song. It says something real. The time most people invest idealizing the past... ...hoping for it to return... ...wastes their lives. Or it returns and they see it isn't what they expected. People are never happy with what they have. They always want things to change. Penelope. Everyone is in their own little world. They wait and wait, hopeful... Penelope. I can't understand the name. What would be her nickname? Pene? It's a beautiful name. It's an old story. But it is very true. It is, listen. You're so sensitive. You're like those women who watch soap operas. "Oh, the poor leading lady!" Who knew? When my boyfriend and I listen to this song... - We like it a lot. - Really? Yes, when my boyfriend and I listen to it... -...it turns us on. - What boyfriend? My boyfriend! What did you think? Nothing, just forget it. That's him. Excuse me, can I bum a smoke? I've been craving one for several blocks... ...but no one was selling. Thanks. Just my brand! Sorry, I'd quit smoking. This fucking anti-smoking law. You can't smoke anywhere. You have really pretty eyes. How much for the smoke? Thanks. Just one question. I'm a photographer. What do you think of this photo? Would you mind telling me who took it? What do you want? I just want to know who took the photo. I barely know him. He asked me to pose and that's it. Don't get feisty. Calm down. Why don't you come with me to my office? We can talk about this. Why don't you ask me here? This isn't the best place to discuss a dead friend. He wasn't my friend! I just told you a man died! A man you knew! You're not surprised? You knew, didn't you? Let's go. Hey! Stop! Stop, Antonio! Stop or I'll shoot! Calm down! I just want to talk! If you just want to talk, why do you have a gun? Are you going to kill me? We can do this the hard way... ...or the easy way. I won't be punished for someone... ...who deserved to die! Calm down! Calm down! Let's make a deal! Okay? I'll put the gun away! You come with me to my office, okay? Look! I'm putting it away! Hey. stop! Shit! All good, Rey? It's under control. - Hi. - Hi, Emilio. I'm glad you came. Nowadays, finding someone interesting... ...intelligent and cute in a chat room is hard. I'd seen you in the chat before... ...but I didn't dare talk to you. I thought you wouldn't talk to me. I'm glad you did. Besides, you're cuter than I expected. You can't see your face in the photo. I'm not that cute but thanks for the compliment. I'll get you a drink. I'm having a martini. Maybe it's a bit strong for you. I don't drink much but one is okay. - Do you like this music? - Yes, it's great. It's my fascination. - Who is he? - Saint Sebastian. Don't you recognize him? I'm not very religious. My fascination isn't a religious matter. - Is it the art? -It's the beauty... ...fortitude and capacity to withstand pain. Well, let's drink. To you and for introducing you to Saint Sebastian. He was a Roman soldier who decided... ...not to persecute Christians. Long story short... ...this situation brought him a lot of trouble and enemies. He was captured. They tied him up and shot arrows at him... ...until they thought he was dead. He took it without complaining. A woman found him and cured him. Once he was healed... ...he went back to what he thought was just... ...until he was caught and finally killed. What a story. Do you see him suffering in any painting? Of course not. You have to know how. Suffering is an art. The art of suffering. I know, suffering isn't anyone's favorite topic. Only mine. Everyone freaks out when I say that. I didn't freak out. Just an ice breaker. I feel more relaxed. You'll feel even better. You'll see. - I'm taking your picture. - Okay. How about one together over here? Don't be stupid. I want your photo. Try posing like him. It'll be fun! Your web site showed your great body... ...and you have an angel's face. I feel embarrassed. Come on, you'll be my Saint Sebastian. I'll be naked and you'll be clothed? If it makes you feel better, I'll take mine off. Don't laugh! You're too far away, come here. Like that one. It's like you're a professional model. Are you a professional photographer? No, it's just another hobby. There are good ones here. Let me see! I'll think about it. Come on, if I was so good I deserve to see them... ...and get a copy of each. You're asking for a lot. I earned it, didn't I? Not yet. What else do I have to do? For now, have another martini. No, I can't. I've had three already. You've had three, I've had six. Are you trying to get me drunk? No, I just want you to have a good time. I'm having a great time. Where's the camera? I haven't seen the photos. I left it in the kitchen. I'll go get it. Rey, you're not like others. You're special. Why do you say that? I don't know, it's just the way you behave. I'm not this way with everyone... ...only with whom I'm interested in. You'll make me fall for you. You think I'd have let you in? You didn't know me and you invited me! Because I get a read on people's vibes. Seriously! You think if I hadn't seen something good in you... ...I'd have let you in or introduced St. Sebastian? You were chosen, Emilio. You'll make me fall in love with you. Let me put on something to dance. What are you doing? We're going to dance. I can't dance. This isn't about dancing. I think I'm drunk. Let's go to my bed. Rey, I like you a lot. I know. Stop! I said stop! Suffer! Enjoy your pain! More coffee? No, thank you. So? I met him about a year ago. I haven't seen him since. Why did you call me to talk about him? I'll be honest with you. This guy, Rey, was murdered... ...more than two days ago. He was torn to pieces. So what? You don't think I'm involved, do you? - Should I? - Of course not! Look, we found on Ray's computer... ...a lot of guys' photos posing as St. Sebastian. I think he collected them. We could only find two through school records. You are one of them. I don't want to ask you uncomfortable questions... ...so tell me everything you know about Rey. I didn't know he died. I only saw him that time. Suffer, you faggot! He made me do many things... ...but the worse part was sex without a condom. He gave me HIV. Me and who knows how many others. I'm sorry to hear that. Look, I'm not happy that he's dead... ...but he wasn't a saint. How is your health? I'm infected and I'll live with it all my life. I have it controlled with my treatment. AIDS hasn't done with me yet. His prints don't match the ones from the house. Yeah, it's pretty clear he wasn't involved. From what he told me... ...many have reasons to get back at him. - The photos were great! - I'm glad. I'll sing you a song. Okay. Stop it. Why are you tying me up? Calm down. Oh, and you sing. Do you like the song? It sounds funny. I heard it as a boy. What's all this? Does it turn you on? Shit! Hey! I'll show you out! Hey! Dear Arturo, I loved you so much... ...and I always will. The damage you caused with your parting... ...will never go away, apparently. By showing the world how to enjoy pain... ...I can numb what I feel, but it always comes back. The world will suffer. This reminder of you inside of me, Arturo... ...is being inserted into little angels... ...who visit me more often now. Life will regret having done this to me. I was told you were here. What news do you bring? They I.D.'d two boys from the photos... ...thanks to school records. Two?! There are over 200 photos! It's hard without names. They're working on it. Let's go look for them. CHATTING WITH PRINCE CHARMING - Good evening. - Come in. What a great house. It's so exact. - Exact? - Yes. Ideal. Thank you. Saint Sebastian. This Jose Rivera is marvelous. You know the artists? Just some. In many ways... ...St. Sebastian has been my fascination for years. Your collection is amazing. Come in. Look at this one. Mama Preti, fight'? Yes, that's right. Despite the pain of the arrows... ...St. Sebastian seems to enjoy it. He's always beautiful. You're trying to impress me. No, not at all. Sometimes I seem smug but I don't mean to be. Seeing these works excites me. You can get as excited as you want. I like it. Nobody really likes suffering. However, my fascination with St. Sebastian is related. Someone who went through a great ordeal... ...but in none of the paintings... Does he show pain. - He either enjoys pain... - Or learned to live with it. Suffering extols he who knows how to live it. It's like I'm hearing myself. What? Nothing, you're saying what I think. How odd. It's rare to find someone who thinks this way. You're generally seen as a mad person. That happens to me. Suffering is an underrated feeling. It's usually cast as negative... ...when it's really the most beautiful in creation. You see, men and women are born suffering. They grow suffering. They learn, live, grow old and finally die suffering. What matters is to use your suffering in your favor. You end up enjoying it. And so, suffering becomes pleasure. That's right. The true alchemy. To turn heavy lead into valuable gold. We're going really deep and we only just met. Yes, but it's like we talked about it before. You say it very naturally. I think about it all the time... ...but I rarely speak of it. It's hot. I feel thirsty. And I haven't offered you a drink. It's not your fault. I haven't stopped talking. My mouth went dry. - What can I get you? - A martini. We're a match there too. What a coincidence, right? LOG IN I got news. It's about time. They found the victim's head, hands and feet. - Confirmed with prints. - Where? A dumpster close to his house. It was all inside bags but gnawed by rats. A coroner is checking him. Let's go see him. Get some news. Wait, hold on. How dare you use the photo you took... ...to hit on me after what you did to me? You 're a real son of a bitch! "Hello. I'm sorry for what I did to you. I'd like to see you..." So you can see how sorry I am. Okay, okay. "So you can see how sorry I am." -"I don't want to hurt you. - Fuck you! I just want to help you and make up for this." "Please." Shit, he logged off. Let's see his profile. It must have information. It's empty. There's no way to track him. Stay logged on in case he writes back. Okay, let's go see the coroner. I hope he's got something good. I must confess I'm a little ahead of you. I must confess I'm a little ahead of you. I drank a couple before you arrived. Sorry to disappoint you, but you're not ahead. I'd also had a few drinks. Really? Well, to St. Sebastian. Amen. Do you like this music or something else? Do you have something to dance to? I can tell you like to dance. I'm not good at it but I like music. Something electronic? Anything special? Surprise me. I think you'll like this. That was great. You're trying to impress me. Aren't you? You know how to play. I've had the best teachers... ...but I don't intend to impress anyone... ...nor save face, I just do as I please. Thirsty? I've only felt so comfortable in few places. To think this is a chat pickup. That's what it's about, you feeling good. - I hope it goes further. - Than what? Than a simple pickup. You never know. Maybe today is the last day we see each other... ...or maybe we'll never stop seeing each other. It'd be worse to scar each other for life. Cheers. I have an idea. What? I'll take some photos of you. I didn't know you're a photographer. It's a hobby, actually. I'm not very photogenic. Don't worry, you'll look amazing... ...posing as St. Sebastian. - You think? - You'll love it. Okay. You don't expect me to be a clothed St. Sebastian, right? Not at all. We'll do it here, at the foot of the stairs. Hands like they were bound. That's it. Lift your arm up more. Great. You look beautiful. Great. Aren't your pants getting in the way? Well, let's play with our clothes. There must be satisfaction above suffering. Maybe an arrow here. Another one here. The most painful one goes here. And the killer, here. No arrow can kill St. Sebastian. No pain is enough to finish him off. Don't move. We need another martini. I'll get them now. The gin is... Don't worry! I got it under control. There are really good ones. I don't know. I'm not photogenic. You won't say that when you see them. - Cheers. - Cheers. It's your turn. What? I'll take pictures of you now. I don't think that's a good idea. - Come on. - No, really. Okay, just a few photos. Drink this liquid courage. I don't think alcohol is necessary in this case. Maybe not, but maybe it is. Tell me, which one is the most beautiful? That's a tough one. Remember your own instructions. Pleasure above pain. I'm an expert in enjoying pain. Really? Why do you say that? No reason. Life taught me. Do you really enjoy it or do you fake it like now? I'm not even faking now. Does that mean I'm making you suffer? Not you. It's not the time. In fact, it's everything out there. I'm shaking. What's going on? No, Rey, suffering is about to begin. Please. Thank you. Thank you for seeing me. I know you're a busy man. Don't worry, I'm at your service. I imagine you know about Rey Lucio's death? Yes. You're one of the few contacts... ...we have to identify him. We found you in his address book... ...on his computer and on his cell phone. I know your relationship was strictly professional. I hope I can help in your investigation... ...but as you say, my relationship... ...and my company's with Rey was commercial. I didn't even know him. What else can you tell me about Mr. Rey? When it came to web design... ...he was a genius! He did many jobs for us and for some clients... ...and about five years ago, Rey had the idea... ...of creating Sex Express Coffee. It was amazing. In less than a year... ...the chat became one of the most visited. Nowadays, it's operational in several Latin countries. As you can see, it was very lucrative for Rey... ...and, why not say it? For us, too. We get a percentage of the subscriptions... ...directly from the bank, it's paid with credit card. I do know about this. Do you know this chat's main objective? Of course. Sex. Though let me say, it's completely legal. We have reasons to believe Mr. Rey's murder... ...is linked to his personal relationships in the chat. Miss, in matters of his personal life... ...I can't help you. We have hundreds of clients and we don't have... ...a personal relationship with any of them. Very well, thank you for your time. I'm at your service. If you think of anything else... ...would you call me? This is my card. I don't know what that would be... ...but if anything happened, I will call you. - Thank you very much. - No problem. Excuse me, officer? One question. What'll happen to Sex Express Coffee? Is anyone operating it? Unfortunately, Mr. Rey didn't have relatives... ...nor friends, or any kind of heir. All his assets will be public property... ...until they are auctioned. As for the web site... ...I don't know. No one can give it maintenance. We may be interested in purchasing it if possible. Why don't you call me next week... ...and I'll tell you where you can apply for it? Unfortunately, you'll have to be patient. You know how these things go in our beloved bureaucracy. - Well, thank you. - No, thank you. Stop it. I don't feel well. Just a few more photos, Rey! I feel really bad. Like Saint Sebastian. Hold on. You're so delicate... ...for one who says he enjoys suffering. You're disappointing me, Rey. He graduated from college... ...with a masters in IT. He's a successful web page designer... ...and owner of Sex Express Coffee. You've visited several times, haven't you? He had two bank accounts. One was very big. Yeah, just look at his house. It's clear he had money. No next of kin or friends... ...only colleagues. - Coffee? - Yes, please. Of all the prints found at the house... ...only two were identified. Ray's and the maid's, the one who called us. I spoke to the coroner. He did have AIDS. He was undergoing treatment but lately... ...it seems to have gotten out of control. Oh, God. He tried to infect the boys and look at the irony now. He infected himself several times. So, what do you think? A simple crime of passion? Sex, death and revenge. What a nice combo. The flash hurt your eyes. What do you want? What do I want? Well, I must confess... ...I thought you'd be distrustful. I slipped something in your drink. It's so common in Europe. I'm really glad, actually... ...that you're back with me. I need you wide awake. You fucking bastard! You like to teach about suffering, huh? Well, today you'll learn a lot more about it! What the fuck do you want?! You want to rob me? Take it all, I don't care! Take the T.V., the laptop... ...there's a lot of money in my closet, take it! You truly are desperate. Tell me something. Do you really think that's what I want? No, Rey. That's not what I want. I want you dead, you bastard! Let me go. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go, okay?! Help! Help! Don't get upset, Rey. Honestly, I'd save my energy... ...because I doubt anyone will hear you here. You made sure you were isolated in this mansion. Was it so your victims' cries went unheard? You remember, don't you? Don't you? I don't know what you mean. You don't know what I mean. What a bad memory. You don't remember them. Of course not, why would you? How strange. How many were they? Fifty? A hundred? A hundred and fifty? Two hundred? How many were they? How many?! You're crazy! I don't know what you're talking about! Let me go! Yeah, I can see that you forget faces. Like mine. It's been two years but I don't think I've changed. Have I? After what you did to me. No, no. It's one thing to abuse... ...but the infection? Knowingly? You went too far. I didn't deserve it, Rey. I was only 22 years old. - Hello, I'm... - I know. Come in. - So you can relax. - What is it? A martini. I've never had one. -It's really strong. - You'll get used to it. I see you liked my collection. Who is it? St. Sebastian, St. Sebastian. It was so easy to have me naked at your feet, huh? The story of a saint, and martinis. He suffered his martyrdom very little. They shot him with arrows thinking he was dead... ...but look at him. Does he look in pain? No. Do you understand what I'm talking about? You have no idea. I'll show you. Lesson 1, pain is the best teaching... ...and I know you like it! You learned something today. I hope you don't forget. SS? SS? Saint Sebastian. Medina! Medina! Look what I found. All this photos were taken here. Most of them, at least. It's the living room. And they're in chronological order. Look. This photo was taken five days ago. October 10th. Let's copy these files and find these boys. - I can do it alone. - All right. Come on, baby... ...don't complain. We had a good time, didn't we? Too bad we'll never see each other again. Scram. - Let me go, stupid! - Shut the fuck up! You want to be like St. Sebastian, right? How about like this?! What kind of lesson were you trying to teach me? Tell me, imbecile! The plague?! Proving St. Sebastian can't fight this plague? You're a low-life. Ready. I, Rey. I will live infected, for the rest of my life. And let me tell you, it's not just me. I know what you did all these years. A lot of us were scarred... "by you! Maybe you'll be happy to see them. Well, I couldn't find many of them... ...in fact, one already died. But others did want to see you again! I'll be right back. I hope you do remember them, Rey. It wasn't easy to put this party together. It took a lot of preparation, but, you know? I think it'll be worth... ...the effort and the wait. October 11th, 2009. I'm very satisfied with tonight's visit. You think there's nothing more to learn... ...but Si. Sebastian inspired me so much today. I saw levels of pain on this angel face... ...that hadn't satisfied me so much for a long time. This reminder of you inside of me, Arturo... ...is being inserted into little angels... ...who visit me more often now. Life will regret having done this to me. We'll obviously skip everyone's story. In the end, you weren't as original as each of us... ...believed at one time. You repeated so much... ...the same story of saints and suffering. The same dances, the same photos... ...the same angel faces! You're a piece of work, Rey, but tell me one thing. How many times did you play the same act? More than a thousand, surely. Tell me something else. Do you really think... ...we learned to enjoy suffering? That was your idea, right? Your mission? Or am I mistaken? Oh, Rey. I don't think we learned that lesson. No one knows how to enjoy their own suffering. Not even St. Sebastian! Those angel faces... ...are only the artist's imagination. But you know how to enjoy suffering... ...others suffering. Now that I think it, we did learn something. Of course we learned something from you. We learned how to hate! Here you have him, boys. He doesn't look so attractive as before, does he? We're only eight here. I couldn't find more. It's crazy, huh? Out of so many you put through this... ...not one of us dared do anything. Not one of us... ...dared raise his voice to Rey. As I said, one already died. He died with the virus. That virus you put in us... ...and that poisoned us. Stop! What the fuck are we doing here?! This isn't fun anymore! Don't punish yourself. The mistake was made... ...so make him pay for it. How's it going? There are prints everywhere. SOVEREIGN PATRON AND MARTYR WE INVOKE YOUR MERCY. ST. SEBASTIAN, KEEP US FROM THE PLAGUES My partner will take you to the station... ...so you can give your statement. Hey, it's okay. You have nothing to worry about. Don't show up again without a jacket, got it? - What happened? - This is the last bit. His whole body is there... ...except the head, hands and feet. As soon as the lab results come back... ...call me immediately. Please. All right, I will. Excuse us. We'll live with this the rest of our lives... ...but I think this is the end of the line for you. ...In the kitchen. - Where is it? - In the kitchen. Oh, Saint Sebastian. You bring out such low passions. To think you're a saint. DISTRIMAX INC.
