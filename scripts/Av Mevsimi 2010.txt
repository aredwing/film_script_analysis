' Yavuz Tanyeli Inspiration forthe film Last night the moon was out. I couldn't even look up. The moon reflected on the water. I hear sounds. Perhaps I heart he leaves falling. Sometimes small animals walk around. Some of them are on me. I'm not scared. It's peaceful here, maybe that's why. What if I laid down like this forever? Why not? As long as they don't hurt me. "He" brought me here. First all the sounds disappeared. Then I heard the forest. Now let's get to the bottom of this. The first thing we say to newcomers in the homicide department is; If you look at things from one perspective you only see one thing. Will what you see bring you... ...to resolution or does it get between you and reality? Sounds complicated, doesn't it? Let me rephrase it. You look and you see this. You say; 'This is it!" "This is the murderer. " What if it isn't? Could you be wrong? Of course! Maybe you can't figure it out from where you're looking. Dead end. What do we do? - We change our position. - How? We exit the dead end enter another street. Find a road where we can see ahead. That's right. We will change our perspective. We will find an opening and look through there to see reality. - Your name is Hasan, right? - Yes, it is, chief. Observe the people around you. Try to guess their criminal potential. A painter looks at the paint on the walls... ...when they first walk into a house. That's called perception. The homicide cops... ...always seek the suspects. Suspicion, always suspicion! That's all for today. Send this as soon as possible, understood? Report back to me once it's sent. - Yes, sir. A hand was found in the swamp forest in Selamli. Go there immediately and report to me on the phone... - We're not on duty, sir. - I know, dris. But the team that's on duty is collecting another dead body. They can't be in two places at once. - Are you convinced? - Murat ne speaking. You can't keep your mouth shut! Life talked, take him in right away! - Sir, Tahir Aka called. - Which one was that? We found his son's body in the backyard, in the chicken coop. - I remember, what about it? - Will you join the interrogation? - Sir, are we going to talk? - What? - Are we going to talk? - Go to my office. I'll be there. Call me in for the interrogation. - What about the phone? - Muharrem Buhar talked. He confessed. Hopefully he won't change his mind when his lawyer is around. - And there's the other case. - Sir, tea? Whose case are you on? - His dad was killed inside a car. His son. I think he did it. He's crying too much after him. Too much. - Done? - Done. Why are you still here? The prosecutor is Macit Hakman. Don't let him come after me. I don't like that man. Go now! We'll go but what shall we do about the staffing? What staffing? We've been short-staffed for two months. We've been working day and night. dris is right, sir. We can't keep up. Choose from one of the newcomers. We need an experienced... - Go get that boy. - Which one? The one who answered my question. His name was Hasan, I think. Why him? Is he suitable? Is he a good fit? Who is he? dris, just bring me the boy! Fine, fine. - Tell me son. - What should I tell you, sir? What did you study? Where do you come from where do you go? - Before the service? - Yes. I studied anthropology. - I'm currently writing my thesis. - What is your thesis about? About serial killers in Turkey. That's why I chose the homicide. And thankfully they chose me, too. There are serial killers in Turkey that we don't know about? No there isn't. That's what my thesis is trying to answer. Why not? My thesis is called; An Anthropological Evaluation... ...of Serial Murders as a Unique Product of Western Society. That's a very flashy name but you didn't need to go to university... ...to find out why there are no serial killers in Turkey. We'd tell you. - Are you married? - No. - Girlfriend? - Yes, sir. - Is it serious? - Kind of. Is she also an athropopopologist? Is this really important? - Stay close to me, write everything down. - Okay. - Greetings. - Greetings Serdar. Hello everyone. dris, how are you? - Thanks. Kadir isn't around? You finally made it. We've been waiting for you. You're right but the traffic was really bad. Prosecutor Macit, we're not even supposed to be on duty today. Hi doctor! Let me introduce. Anew addition to our team, Hasan Rifat Adigzel. Best of luck to you. Should we call you Hasan or Rfat? - Hasan would work, sir. - Fine. What's the situation? Suspicious death. So far we only found a mutilated arm. - The search is ongoing. - The team is great. - No other body parts? - Nothing. - Who found it? - This guy saw it. The waiter at the teahouse across. He called us during the day. He didn't see any suspects. Not many folks come here during this season. Let me take a look at this hand. Let's pray that the other body parts will surface. It's tough just one hand. Hasan, say hi to the hand. What are you doing, this is evidence! Can I have a look? What kind of a cut is this doctor? I think it's a knife cut... ...but I'm just saying that without analyzing. It looks like it was cut after death. The blood had left the body. The bruises confirm it, too. - Looks like a kid's hand. - Could also be a young girl. - There is nail polish. - Right. It's a young girl's hand. We need help over here. Give us a hand, please? Let's go Hasan, you said hi to the hand... ...and now comes a brand new experience. You held on well. I saw a lot of newbie's faint on their first day. I found a bone. This is probably an animal bone. What are we looking for here? Anything that might count as evidence. The arm has been cut with a knife. Start with the knife, then the syringe, underwear, lipstick... ...bag, driver's license, ID. They didn't teach... ...this stuff to you? Go ahead. Where am I? I'm in a lot of places. I'm everywhere. I'm scattered. I disappeared. - I'm done watching the game. - What happened? The team is not even walking, let alone running. Trabzonspor is a different story. That's in my blood. dris, tell Crime Scene Investigation... ...that there are boot and wheel prints here. Tell them to take pictures and molds. - Don't forget about tomorrow night! - What's tomorrow night? Detective Mustafa's retirement night. At Halit Brother's coffee house. Follow the forensics. How about a drink after work? I don't want to make Kezban wait. She's waiting on the missus all day. Just one drink. Newby you, too. - How's your wife? - She's doing ok. First we're going to set up the investigation format. You brought me along without setting up the format. The format takes just two minutes. Let's just enjoy this. I washed my hands and face many times and it still smells. It'll stink for a while. The smell of a corpse stays. Let's drink. Don't worry about it. All in due time. So your mom is in Ankara. - And your dad? He passed away. My mom lives with my sister. Is your girlfriend here? Does she have a job? Yes. She owns a restaurant, also a butcher. A restaurant owner and a butcher. Interesting. Her father owns a meat restaurant. It's in the family. - Do you happen to be married? - No need to be so formal with me. He was married but he's crazy. Couldn't keep the girl. You, too? And it is me who held their wedding. Yes, why don't you tell him. He kidnapped thru poor girl. No, first start with "They didn't allow the wedding. " Then you tell the story, we'll listen. He kidnapped Asiye but her family went after him. They decided to shoot dris. His family is also strong-willed. They're from the Black Sea Region. Bunch of crazies. They were about to have a feud. At the time I was doing my service in their hometown. His father and I became really close. He was teaching me how to build boats. We used to go out fishing together. So anyway. Cemil, his father said; I fit was up to me I'd say shoot him, he'll learn a lesson. But his mom would be very upset. He said "Could you do something about it?" He said "Go do something not could you?" I'd do anything for Cemil, so I talked to both families. They forgave him. I saved his ass. May God bless you. After my father died in the sea, Ferman became like a father to me. Thanks to him I'm in the service. I could never pay him back. It's hard to make a marriage work with this job. Asiye is a little crazy but she's a nice girl. I made her suffer a lot. We were trying to make it work but it didn't, with all the fighting. Sorry Kezban, I'm a little late. Don't even mention it. How is she today? You know she can be a little tired on days like this. - Could I leave? - Of course. God bless you. - Good night. - Good night. Bro, could you look over here? - You guys had a few drinks? - That crazy guy, he insisted. - How was your day? - As usual. - We found a hand. - What? A hand? Oh my God, I don't believe it. What did you do with the hand? It was sent to the forensics in a package. - It smells in here. - Really? Mr. Arda, excuse me. It smells in here. That's not possible. You're right. There is a smell. Pelinsu I'm talking to you. Nanna I'm on the phone. Just give me a break. Come and gather your things. Nanny! I'll call you back later. You never listen to what I say. We spend our lives trying to understand what you're saying. What kind of language is that Pelinsu? What kind of language? I don't speak her language. You better send me to learn it, maybe then I'll understand her. You don't know what you're saying. You're starting to sound like your mom. Efecan did you eat? You're done eating but I haven't eaten. Go to your rooms, right now. Pelinsu you, too. - But dad, there's a show on TV... - I said, right now. The boy never comes home, the girl is always on the phone. - What happened? - Nothing. - dris, what happened? - Nothing mom. Things happen every day. Robbery, kidnapping. Is this what you worry? My hand is not pretty. My mom's hands are pretty but they smell like onions. My dad's hands smell like cigarettes, they're black. They become more black when he's angry. My granddad used to say hands tell tales. My granddad used to tell tales with his hands. People used to stare at his hands. He used to say each hand has a story. He could see it, I guess. When I look at my hands... I only see bitten nails OK, I get it, but? We'll move forward after we hear what the forensics and CSI say. The forensics are working on the hand, CSI is looking for the rest of the body. We saw the hand. The fingertips have been really damaged by the water. Fingerprints will be hard to get. All we know is that the arm was cut with a knife... ...and belongs to a young girl. And was mutilated after death. Doctor, give me good news! I stayed up all night, but I got the fingerprints. Doctor, you're great! Fingerprints need to be transferred to the CSI. We'll take care of it. According to the girl's bone development she is about 15 or at most 16. Death took place about There were pieces of skin inside her finger nails. I'll check the DNA. Hopefully, the skin belongs to the attacker. I beg you, please hurry up. Good news. The doctor got the fingerprints. And he found some skin fragments. He'll check the DNA. Death took place at the most 5 days ago. Okay. Good luck with the work. - Is this the new guy? - Yes. - How is he? - Good in theory not so much in practice. Hasan go to forensics, right away! Get the fingerprint flee... ...and take it to CSI. Then, read the files on the other cases. Take notes. I'm going to ask questions. Read very carefully the case of the son... ...who is suspected in his father's death. dris, your wife is here. What are you doing here? What have you done? What kind of a man are you? - What are you taking about? - You hospitalized the poor man. - Are you crazy? - Are you just realizing that? Life got really hurt he should report it to the police. You bandit! You beat him up and then you show him your badge. How can he report you? I'm going to lose my job because of you. Don't mess up with my job. I can't survive on the alimony you give me. Then stop wagging your tail. I don't wag my tail to anybody. Besides I'm single, I live as I wish. - Don't drive me crazy. - You're already crazy. - I swear I'll kill you. - I dare you to kill me. Don't come for the kids this weekend. I won't give them to you. What do you mean? There is a court order! Fk the court order! You're not a man! Tonight, we're sending off a beloved colleague from our service. There's a lot to be said But it's best to keep it short. Best of luck to you. This service will never forget you. Here is a little something to remind you of us, from all of your friends. I'm not much of a talker but I'll say that... ...I'm leaving my heart behind. Don't forget me. Long live the Homicide Department! I wish we could all retire like this. He was one of the toughest guys in the job. The man who owns this coffee house, him, too. The man next to Hunter is your namesake, They're among the legends at the Homicide. Of course Hunter is the greatest. - Why do they call him Hunter? - Why do they call me crazy? Because I get crazy and he hunts. - Hello? - How's it going? Good. What's up? My dad wants to meet you, He said it's about time. When are you free? My security firm is looking for new people. Let's give you a job there. You can't live on your retirement pension. Mustafa, I'm fed up. I spent my whole life chasing after criminals. You remember the case of Ragip from Eyp? You got him in the end. I got him in the end but I lost 14 kilos. - 14 kilos! - Ok. - Your girlfriend? - How did you know? You slouched, you glanced sideways, looked a little surprised. Your face got red. Your whole body says it. Mustafa! Cheers everyone! Cheers everyone! 1, 2, 3 Oh, my head. It's killing me. Barely made it to the morning. It happens when you drink that much. Thanks. We kept on drinking. I blacked out. I don't remember how I made it home. - Where is he? - Who? - The newbie! At the crime scene department. He'll be back soon. They found the case from the fingerprints. - Wow. - That's it. We got it. Her name is Pamuk. Pamuk Seyhan. Arrested for selling drugs... ...let go for lack of evidence. There is an address, no identity number. She's just a kid! Only 16. She might be just a kid but she means business. She looks real innocent to me, poor girl. You're the kid! Show me a woman who is innocent and I'll slit my wrists! Let's go and visit this address... ...and see what we can find. Go to the car. I'll be there after I inform Chief Murat. Even a dog wouldn't stand this smell. - Yes? - Police. - What's it? - Could we come in? Excuse the mess. - What's the purpose of your visit? - What's your name? Kamuran, sir. Kamuran Tora. Do you know this person? - Sure I do. This is Pamuk. - Does she live here? - No. - How do you know her? She used to come by my workplace! - What do you do? - Bartender. Pamuk used to hang out at the bar. She was underage but the boss didn't mind. - We became friends overtime. - Was she your lover? - No, I'm gay. - Do you have her phone number? Of course! - She gave the police your address as her residence. We'll, she has a boyfriend, Acid. What do you mean? His nickname is Acid. He sells drugs. Acid mer. He used to sell at the bar. He's a total jerk. He would beat her up all the time. Pamuk would come stay with me for a day or two... ...then she'd go back to that asshole. They arrested her for selling drugs... ...she had no idea what was inside her purse. That jerk was using her. They let her go. She must've given my address at the station not to give him up. She's going to get me in trouble! Here's her number. You got Acidt's number? No. He changes it frequently. He is around a lot but no one knows where he lives. - How old is he approximately? - Definitely older than Pamuk. Perhaps between 20 and 25. dris, let's get information from the narcotics about Acid mer. - No one there. - Did Pamuk have any other boyfriends? No, she was madly in love with that jerk. She's from the ghetto and all but she's real soft, Pamuk. She's soft like cotton. - Will this Acid guy come to your place tonight? - He will! Life does, call us at this number. We'll be around. Hasan, get the bar's address and number too. Is there a problem? Did something happen to her? Lift did, who would've done it? - Of course that asshole Acid. He was beating her up a lot. He was really mad when Pamuk refused to sell drugs. He put his cigarette out on her chest, right in front of my eyes. Can you open up your wrists? - Sorry? - Can you show me your wrists? Did you get information on Acid? Yes it's there. What if he doesn't call? Then we're gonna stay up all night. What if he doesn't call tomorrow night? Then we're here on duty every night until he calls us. Our job is patience, young man. You know I'm really curious about this anthropology thing. What are you curious about? First of all, why would someone study something with such a complicated name? Second, what is anthropology really? First of all it's because... ...I was placed into it but... ...I started liking it then I couldn't find a job after I graduated. That's why I'm a cop. What is anthropology? We can call it the study of humans, roughly. And more finely? We'll let me put it this way; Anthropology studies why Americans show the middle finger and... ...Turks place their thumbs between two fingers. That's what anthropology studies. You got your answer. Chief if you allow me... Alright. - Yes, Yasemin? - My dad is inviting you to dinner. Really, what did he say exactly? In your restaurant? OK, then. You better watch out. The people in the service don't like your behavior. What was that all about with you and Asiye, the other day? - I'm suspicious. - What are you suspicious about? That's not a good feeling to have. You taught us suspicion. You said; "Be suspicious. Don't believe what you see. If you can't see, change your perspective. " I changed my perspective towards Asiye. Tell that to the people in the service. Yes? Ok, we're on our way. I'll call you later. Hasan, you stay here. Watch the door. If you see anyone running away, you follow. Acid! Stop! Police! Stop! I got you. We're not done with this anthropology thing. dris watch where you're going. Take down the license number. I did. I am. First anthropology, then serial killers. - Please, don't! - I gave my doctorate in that field. - dris, you want me to drive? - Of course, not. He turned right. - He turned right, right. - Stop. - Get out of the way. Move it. Don't you see the police alarm? Police! - Didn't see it. - Don't you see? Don't you see it? - Where the hell did he go? - This is where you end up if you bullshit... ...and distract yourself. - You saw it, the car cut in front of me. - I'm talking to you. - Hi, chief. Come back. Stop. Isn't that the car in the distance? - Chief, how did you see it? - He is the Hunter, he sees. Don't go in. Let him think we lost him. Park here. Let's silence the radios and the phones. There are bulletproof vests in the back. This neighborhood is shady. He is here. Let's call for support. He will fly away until support shows up. - I say we go in. - We have no idea what's inside. It's too risky without the support. - The bastard's about to leave. - He says we should wait. But the guy is as sly as a fox. He smelled danger. Support is on its way. Sir, let me have a quick look around. - Just wait, they're coming. I don't feel good about this. We catch him tonight or we don't catch him at all. - He is going to drive me crazy. - Don't move. Come on, let's take a walk! Don't let anyone in or out. And don't take any risks. - Hey brother. - Police! Stop. We'll done! Your really fd up! What are we going to do now? - Ok. Let's wait for support. - Listen to me! We're not narcotics police. We're from the Homicide Desk. We don't have a problem with you. We just want to talk to mer. That's all. Give us mer and we'll go. Goddamn you! Why are you not listening? I said we'll leave after we get Acid. Stay where you are. I thought I put you on silent. Yes Yasemin? We were going to meet my dad on Sunday. - Yes! - Let's make that Monday. What's all that noise? - Fireworks. - What fireworks? Where are you? - Can I call you back? I'm really busy. Stop. I said stop. Police. Turn around. Slowly! Slowly! Chief what are you doing? I raised my hands. I beg you. - Are you OK? - I'm shot. - What? - I'm shot. You're ok. The bullet is stuck on the vest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney. If you don't have a private one... ...the state will provide you with one. You ask for support but you don't wait for it. Is your duty to be in a crossfire? Your duty is to catch murderers. One dead, one injured. Two detectives under your care. You risked their lives. An experienced officer shouldn't do that Hunter. You're absolutely right, sir. I made an error in judgment. I can resign right away. My retirement is coming up anyway. Do as you see fit. Now excuse me. Take a look, it's Acid's file. I got you in trouble, didn't I? I'll go talk to the chief and tell him what really happened. You got used to acting out on your own dris. I am still the leader of this team. When I retire you can do whatever the hell you want. But while I'm here you're going to speak when I allow you to. You understand? Get yourself together, come to the interrogation room. Are you ok? What about you? - A person died. - A newbie's life was saved. He was out of bullets. Look, this is a dirty job, there is garbage, dead bodies... bodies torn into pieces, bad smells. We deal with dead people. If you can't handle it, don't do it. Go get some sleep now. Are you hungry mer? You want me to get you a sandwich? - No, thanks. - You know her? - Yes! - Her name? - Pamuk. - Pamuk what? - Pamuk Seyhan. - How do you know her? We were together once. Once upon a time. Why were you surprised to see her? Perhaps because he didn't think he would be seeing her again. - When and how did you meet her? A few years ago. At one of those ghetto discoes. She used to hang out there. And I... And you needed someone to sell drugs for you. First you got her addicted. She was allergic to all kinds of drugs. She didn't do drugs. Besides we were really close. We really loved each other. If you really loved her why did you beat her up? - Not true, who's making this stuff up? - You know her family? - Yes. - You know her house then. Yes, I'll give you the address. You can give the address after you tell us what happened. - What happened? - You look like you could tell us the truth. We've been up all night. Just tell us so we can go home. Please, chief. I didn't do anything. If you didn't do anything, why did you run away, you bastard? Chief I thought you were narcotics. I had trouble with them. We know everything. You even used a knife. Knife? Do you mean she is killed? Don't play with us. As if you don't know. What knife? I can't even slice bread. I swear to God I have nothing to do with this. I didn't kill her. She was my lover. I loved her and she loved me. What did she find in you to love? My eyes are blue. That's what she used to say. She loved you and you beat her up. I beat her up but that was it. I didn't hurt You motherfer. You put your cigarette out on her chest, you psycho! Just talk. I was on a pill. I was high. I don't even remember. I haven't seen her for a while. Show me the most important person in the world and I'll swear on them I didn't do it. But you know who did it! There is someone you suspect. Alright, if you're not gonna say anything... ...I'm gonna have your whole life get scrutinized. I'm gonna talk to the prosecutor... ...to keep you locked up forever. And declare you as a narcotics informant. For now you have 3 days inside to think about it. We'll see if you go something to tell. dris get the girl's address from him. Get all his phone calls looked at. And show me your wrists. Flip. Open up. Don't you know that all of our men... ...are the same, with attitude. That's not true. dris change a lot. His job ruined him. Each murder made him crazier than before. Whatever I did, wherever I looked, he was suspicious. He started following me. He was looking for a hidden meaning in my every word. Is it a thing to do? Who can endure such a torment? How can you live with a paranoid husband? Paranoid? Look, two days ago we found a young girl's hand. Perhaps she was running away from someone as well. Maybe if her parents were a little more paranoid it'd be different. Pray that the same thing won't happen to you. I don't want to go dumpster diving for you corpse. And I told you. You can't have the kids. I'm not giving them. - How come you don't give them? - I just don't. Good bye! See mom? He's really crazy! - See what he's doing? - Listen to me! You punish the children not your wife. They want see their mom. Stop acting like this. Yes, sir? I'm at home. - Yes? - Come right away! - You never sleep? - We never sleep. Can you tell me why you're here officer? Mslm Bey, we ask the questions here and you respond. I'm listening. Anyone else in this family besides Pamuk? She has two brothers. Abbas and Vakkas. - Where are they? - They're at work. Do you know where your daughter is... ...Hatun Hanim? - No, officer. Did you report her as missing? Why? She's not missing. - Then you know where she went. - We do. God bestowed her with a great place to go... ...but she didn't appreciate it. - Don't talk like that. Why? Is that a lie? - She didn't live here? No. She got married. She lived with her husband. How did a 16 year old get married? Battal Bey got her age changed to a year older and then married her. Opened his house to her, did everything she wanted... ...but there was something evil about her... ...she gave all that up to go be with that good-for-nothing man. This man, does he nave a name? mer. He's a loser, good-for-nothing. There was something between them before. We did everything to keep them apart. I broke her bones. Her brothers beat her up but she kept seeing him in secret. Then we were blessed with Battal Bey. But now we're disgraced. Especially against Battal Bey. - Mr. Battal? - He's our benefactor. I've been his gardener since Adana. My wife used to clean up his mansion. - Pamuk used to help. - He must be very rich. - You don't know him? - Should we? Everyone knows Battal olakzade. This Battal olakzade is that the Battal olakzade? Yes. Owner of olakzade Holding. Yes. He owns hundreds of frms. He was the chairman of the chamber of commerce. He's very rich. He's our benefactor. My dad was his dad's gardener. He brought us to Istanbul before Pamuk was born. My youngest son is helping his new gardener. Big family. Sons and daughters. - Wait a second, wasn't he married? - He was... ...but then he fell for our daughter. That's how God wanted it. Police officer, tell me. What happened to my daughter? Hatun Hanim we believe that your daughter is dead. We think she has been murdered. God give the and taketh away. She got what she deserved. She lived a life deserving death. It's our duty to find out who did it. We'll share the details at the station. The detectives will talk to the neighbors. - Did she have a room? - Of course! After she got married I never touched my sweet one's belongings. Can I look around? Show me your wrists. There are still mosquitoes buzzing around. Nothing's changed. You can't fall asleep because of the sound. I smell the gutter. I smell the onion on my mom. I don't like that smell. My mom is a part of the kitchen, always at the stove, with a wooden spoon. In my room I imagine things. I write stories. I become a ghost. I disappear. Then my dad's hatred, my brother's violence... ...the grocer's sweaty smell, screaming kids... ...gossiping neighbor women, they all disappear. I escape into tales. I become a ghost. I disappear. Poor girl, they forced her to get married at age 16. Yes but why did Battal have to change her age? A girl at 16 can marry with her family's consent. Guess it wasn't enough or else why would he bother? There is a very important player in the game now; Battal olakzade. He's connected to ministers, parliament representatives, high-level bureaucrats. Secret phone calls will be made they'll try to scare us. Go after Battal olakzade, take him in for an interrogation. Be careful. You can leave now. Ferman don't let dris... ...get out of control. My two sons manage 5 meat restaurants. I manage 3. We're a chain. I don't count my daughter, she does her own thing. But our business is meat not the restaurant. This meat. My sheep feeds on the grass from Bursa and Balikesir... ...and my cattle feeds on the grass from ankiri. Why is that? Those grasses have thyme. Thyme makes meat delicious. My animals never move. Why? Cause animals that don't move get fat. Animals that move, they get muscles. My animals stay put. Dad, are you done talking about meat? We're you expecting someone else? - What are you talking about? - I don't know. Your hair, your make-up, your clothes. You look dolled up. dris why are you here? What do you want? First go get something to wear. Yes, I'm listening. dris, what is it? Why do you look like that? dris what's wrong with you? Oh my god. The power went off. dris get up and get the flash light from that drawer. - dris get up. - Calm down. - Where is it? - Inside that drawer. If you know where it is, why don't you get it yourself? As if you don't know I get so scared of the dark. But you have some wind in your sails. Coward hero. - Which drawer? - That one. You were afraid of the dark when you were a little kid, you're a big woman now. - The battery is dead. - You see? I'm scared. - dris? - Yes? There are candles in that cupboard. dris, go grab them. dris, that's enough. Come closer. What did you call me? Coward hero? Is there anything else you know... ...that I am scared of? - Thunder. - That was when I was a kid. What about from me? I was never afraid of you. Crazy people are not scared of each other. See how my heart's beating. Maybe I'm a coward. I came here to kill you. Why? Then kill me. When I'm gone I know you. You don't take care of yourself. You're forgetful. You're careless. You ignore things That's why I made a list of things for you to do when I'm gone. I'm writing it down as I remember. Marriage certificate, identification cards... ...insurance policy are at the top drawer. Stomach medicine is in the kitchen. Don't miss the expiration date, Your underwear is at the top drawer on your side of the bed. Abbas, Vakkas, don't get lost! We'll look into everything you said. If you lied then you're gonna pay for it. Show me your wrists. Ok, go. Are the brothers involved? Abbas used to only beat Pamuk. Maybe he beat her to death. He says Acid mer did it. He's sure of it. I even pressed his button. "How can you let that man roam around, your sister ran away with him?" He said; "If we'd found him we wouldn't let him live". Vakkas said about the same thing. He says Acid and nothing else. It's obvious they've worked on the testimony. Vakkas works as a gardener for Battal olakzade. - That's interesting but why are you grinning? - It's nothing! They're really big. Roads, construction, textile, dam building, automotive... We know all that. More importantly, can we reach anything... ...personal about Battal? I have 80 firms that make I have hundreds of thousands of workers. Construction, energy, textile. We have over 20% of the market share in all of them. But I chose retirement. I passed the business over to my children. It's my time for silence. I will tell you one last story. Maybe you get it, maybe you don't. They say I'm a rude man. Be it. But don't forget in business... ...no one pays for politeness. Intelligence is money. They know I like hunting. It's a habit I take after my father. He used to take me to the Taurus Mountains when I was a kid. We're from Adana. We used to hunt whatever we could. I mean, my dad was hunting and I watching. My dad shot a deer once and... I watched the deer die right in front of me. His eyes were staring into mine. I started crying. That was the first and last time my dad slapped me. He said; 'Son, if you're gonna cry don't come hunting. Death is a part of the hunt. ' He said; "Life is a hunt. Either they hunt you or you hunt. Make a choice. " That slap was a lesson. I never cried after that. Not even in game hunt or human hunt. That's the essence of the system. There are hunts and hunters. You have to decide; Are you going to be the prey or the hunter? - Thank you. - You chose a great subject. I'm glad you like it. Thank you. - Glad you could make it. - You speech was really good. I'm retired now. You can call me whenever you want. I'll come running. Thank you Battal Bey. Sir, we are from the police service. We need to speak to you in connection to an investigation. - Right here and right now? - Wherever and whenever you want, sir. Let's go to my house then. We'll have some tea. Follow us. - You wait here. - Why, sir? Wait. Wait a minute. Come in. He's really pleased with himself. I'd like to get a hunting rife like this one. - Do you have 500thousand dollars? - Excuse me? That's the price but it's not for sale. It's my father's. You like hunting? We all do but Brother Ferman is most famous for it. - Really, what do you hunt? - He mostly hunts humans. That's just a joke. Let me introduce ourselves. This is Idris Altu. - And I am Ferman Tezcan. - Here. We're here to talk about your wife Pamuk. - Is she in trouble? - Should she be in trouble? I don't know. The police is here and they want to talk to me about my wife. What would you say? I'd say, if she could be in trouble... ...why didn't I first go to the police before they came to me? That's what I'd say. Since when have they been sending the police after women who run away from home? That isn't Battal olakzade, is it? I couldn't take care of it myself? Could you take care of it? What would you do to your wife if she ran away from home? Chief Ferman, what happened to my wife? We believe she has been murdered. Alright, sir. What did I say? I said a minister would get involved... ...if Battal olakzade is involved. There is a minister. - Not even started yet. - Only a hand? We'll find the rest, soon. There is a big team searching. Why did she run away? Ask that to the man she ran away with. Did anything happen to make her run away? Like what? Like, violence, abuse, a death threat. Again, ask that to the guy she ran away with. She experienced violence and death threats with that drug-dealer. Did he tell you she stabbed her before? You must've found out already. If not, this is a disgrace for you. You didn't do anything to bring her back? I gave this girl a home. I gave here my love. I did everything she wanted. I even take care of my first wife, still. She still lives under my roof. But my new wife, she left. And she paid the price. Could I have brought her back? Perhaps. But that wouldn't be right. Does your ex-wife have something to do with her escape? On the contrary, Hilal accepted her. Didn't say anything against her. Treated her like a mother. Pamuk was just a kid when she first came here. She grew up here. Her dad was my gardener. Her brother still is my gardener. You mean you benefited from the whole family. I don't know what happened, I guess I fell for her. She was like a family back then. She was about to get lost while chasing after that good-for-nothing boy. I said why not. Her dad was already willing. Why didn't you adopt her? You are right. She's younger than my youngest daughter. But who wouldn't want a young wife. Especially at our age? Is it over? I have a lot of work to do. Ok, sir. Not right now but we'd like to talk to your staff. You can talk to my staff but you should really talk to that bastard she ran away with. He has the answer to your question. Could we take a look at Pamuk's belongings? First we put it all in storage then we gave it all away. Because you knew she wouldn't be coming back? Because even if she came back she wouldn't be welcome in this house. Come on, we're leaving. You go. I'm going to the bathroom quickly. How did you come in here? Leave, right away. I'm really sorry. It's dangerous to get this close to the patient. It's very irresponsible. It's Battal Bey's daughter, right? Don't worry I'm a police. - I don't care who you are. It's infectious, it's not safe to approach the patient. - Why? - Why? Are you ignorant? You'd risk the immune system. Why do people have respiratory failure? I'm not going to ask why because you get angry. God help her. Only the bathrooms don't have cameras, I peed in comfort. But I was sad about the girl. All the wealth in the world doesn't mean a thing. What's wrong with her exactly? Respiratory failure or something. He said infection as well. Immune system. The doctor, he asks more questions than he gives answers for. This Battal is kind of inauspicious. He didn't strike me as very dependable. Why are you laughing at everything? Really? I'm laughing? One; Acid. The guy she ran away with. He's a psychopath, high on drugs, could do anything. He's got stabbing... ...beating up, cigarette burning under his belt. Muslum. There are a lot of motives for Pamuk's dad as well. Their honor, most visibly. He feels indebted to Battal. They built a house out of the slum they were were living in with help from Battal. The girl has been beaten up by everyone. The neighbors have gotten used to her screaming. Brothers. Abbas. Vakkas. We could ask; "If they killed her why did they leave Acid alive?" Yes but they said; '"We would've done it if we had found her. " Honor victims are usually women. But if we change our perspective... ...we could see this as a collaborative effort. Battal. His wife ran away. His reputation collapsed. He's a wounded hunter, he lost his prey. He wanted it done and the family got it done. There is Battal's ex-wife Hilal. They still live in the same house. After all those years... ...she couldn't probably have accepted him getting married to a young girl. Let's just hope it's not connected to the olakzade family. They have long arms that will strangle a lot of necks. - Chief this is the situation. - Ok, you keep going. Hasan, you do a thorough internet search ...on the olakzade family. dris you and I we'll go after Acid. Yasemin, hi. I'm going to be here tonight, could we cancel the dinner? - Would you like a cigarette? - Of course I would. God bless you. It's not banned inside? Look my man, here's the thing, if you don't talk to us the whole thing will be on you. You're stuck in the thick of it. All signs point at you. - What do you mean, chief? - We mean that... Everything points at you. Our girl married a rich guy but she didn't... ...stay put, she ran away to you. - Is that true? - Yes, but... I'm not done yet. You also stabbed her before. You told us that you couldn't even slice bread... ...but apparently you're skilled. Pamuk's arm was also cut with a knife... ...and her whole family swears that you did it. This is not narcotics or petty thefts. You'd end up with a life sentence. But if you know something's that might change things for you. We're gathering evidence both for and against you. It's a different story inside prison. If you want you can call your lawyer right away. Chief, I know things but you have to protect me from that man. Which man? Which man son? Battal olakzade. Why? He threatened you? This is not about Pamuk running away to me. What is it about then? Tell us what you know. We can make you a secret witness. We'll protect you. Let's get this over with. No way. You can't protect me. Things are more complicated than they appear. If I go to jail I won't make it out of there alive. I have to disappear. Go abroad. Let's make a deal. If you drop the case against me I'll talk. And you'll solve this case right away. It's not like you think it is. I'm sorry but that's how it is. It's done, right? - Don't say no to me! We just have to wait. - We kept our promise. - Thank you chief. Now we can go drink tea somewhere and I'll tell you everything. No. First we'll go to the station. I'll take you into the interrogation room, you'll have your lawyer with you. - You'll tell us everything. - Ok, chief. - But we'll have some tea? - You keep talking about having tea! Drop your weapon. - Who talked you into this? - I did it on my own. You killed your sister as well for the same reason. No, if I had I'd be proud of it. Acid mer killed her. My sister ran away to him and we never heard from her again. He ruined our family's reputation. And this is how he paid for it. Who gave you the gun? I got it years ago. I don't remember from whom. Was it your dad or Battal Bey? Vakkas, don't let them use you. Who talked you into this? My son, Vakkas. Isthistrue? What did you do? Mom, let go. I want my son. I want my son. Let go! Please let go! - Give me my son. - No, mom. The state will provide you a lawyer or you can hire yourself... ...and follow the developments through him. I want my Vakkas. - Mom! - God give you patience. - Give me my son. Are we sheeps to scarify? Didn't we give him enough? He took my daughter, my son as well. Damn you. It's all because of you. Chief evket, if Pamuk was murdered by Acid, then this case is closed. - And Vakkas killed him for revenge. - Yes. What do you say? He made him do it. He's behind everything. Hunter, we're talking about Battal olakzade. We can't go against him without solid proof. He's very powerful. - We need more than just your instincts. - We'll find it chief. Vakkas' mom didn't attack her husband for nothing. She knows things. dris go talk to her when her husband isn't around. With your permission I would like to visit Battal Bey... ...and talk to Hilal Hanim. Hasan, come with me. The police are here and they want to talk to you. Let them come in. Please. Hope you're doing well Hilal Hanim. We came to see Battal Bey. He's out on the terrace. Since I'm already here, I have a few things I wanted to ask you. - I'm listening. - It's about Pamuk. Poor girl! Who could have done it? I'm curious because she made your husband divorce you. And he married her. You must've been really angry and you might... I see what you're implying. But she was just a kid who came to this house. - She was one of us. - And your husband's new wife. But I never made any sense out of this marriage. It was like a joke. Battal did something he'd never do. All my kids protested. He still married her even despite Ceylan's protests. Ceylan has a special place in his heart. And she never agreed with this marriage. She even threatened to leave the house. Because other health condition... ...she couldn't leave. Battal Bey abused our poverty. I believe that he talked Vakkas into this. He provoked him. I swear... ...not even his dad or his brother talked to him about killing him. Pamuk is gone. Vakkas is done. Tell me if we're not the sheeps to scarify. So you ask me this Acid character is killed for what. Because he knew things that might implicate me but he was too scared to talk. So you're asking what he knew and why he was too scared to talk. Is that what you're asking? Is that correct? That is correct. To rephrase my dad; "How do I know?" Why do you ask me these things? The bastard kidnaps my wife. My wife's brother kills him. The deed is done. What do you want me to do? Pray after him? Ok, I will. What about Pamuk? If I were you I'd wonder about honor killings. Some families care a lot about their honor. Some fathers and brothers can't handle something's. Any other questions? Asiye. Hi. It's dris. Can I see you? No, not on the phone. I need to see you. Where shall we meet? It's my job to ask questions. It's my job to catch murderers. There are two murders we need to resolve. I know I'm bothering you but I need to ask you questions. You're trying to trap me. You're playing mind games with me. Look, I'm a hunter, so are you. In some hunts you aim and pull the trigger... ...and either shoot it or miss it. And sometimes, you make a trap. But traps don't suit a hunter but it still exists. It requires mastery. The rule is that... ...your game should not realize there is a trap. I did that. You think I'm a deer easily to be trapped? Your mind is not a match against mine. Come back here when you have something to say. Don't come knocking on my door all the time. I thought maybe I'd learn something about hunting from you... ...but you're no match against me. If you want to find out what's going to happen to you... ...try knocking on my door again. Welcome. Have a seat. - What would you like? - dris I don't have time for this. I need to get back. - What is it? Listen, I thought about it. Cevriye is right. The kids need a mom. We can't do it without you. I can't live without you. I want you to come back home. I'll try to change. I know I can be a real dick sometimes. - The other day I was thinking that... - dris, it's not even possible. Why not? I can't come back home. If you want I can take the kids back but I can't come back. Why? But the other night. You and I? That was just a momentary weakness. What happened the other night was a mistake. A mistake? A mistake? Here's a mistake. This is another mistake. - Behave yourself. - You've never seen a mistake. That's enough. Get lost. - Sir could you calm down? - Stay away. Don't you dare! Get away. - We're closed. - We're closed, sir. - Give me a bottle of vodka. - Sir I said we're closed. The band is rehearsing. If you come back at 8, we'll be of service. Don't cause any problems. I said give me a bottle of vodka. Give me a glass as well, a big one. We woke up the the sleeping lion! This is what happens when you walk into someone's house without any evidence. What else did he say? He said don't come back here. I say we wiretap Battal Bey's phones. If you can get a court order... ...then you can listen to his conversations all you want... No way. We can't get a court order against him. We need to keep going after him. Without a single evidence... ...what are you going to prove? Director please trust my instincts. Please believe in me, I need a little more time. You'll see that I'll prove this. I... This conversation is over. No wiretapping. What job offer? My dad's making a job offer. He wants you to manage one of his restaurants. Really? Don't even think about it. Money's good. Working hours are set. Hey Hasan! Is your conversation over or should I find someone else to help me? I'm sorry sir. I'll call you back later. - Yes? - It's me, Asiye. - dris attacked me. - When? Just now. The bastard's gonna kill me. For the love of God please do something. He's always threatening me. He wouldn't listen to anybody but you. - I'm begging you please. - I'll take care of it. You two, come with me. Look Hasan. You're on the phone all the time talking. You're just a newbie, you don't know shit. Finishing university, writing a thesis does not cut it for this job I warned you before. No phones. This is your final warning. And you, dris. I warned you, too but you didn't listen either. Let go of that girl. Stop threatening her. Be a man. I'll put you both out the door. You know that I'll do it. I'm fighting a jackal. He's messing with us. A poor girl has not even been buried. Her prayer is not handled yet. Shame on you. This is how you're going to send me off from the service? Anthropology my ass. Does your craziness only work against women or can you use it to solve a case? Shall we drink? He put us in our place. We'll, he's right. The most annoying thing about him... ...he's always right. - I'm leaving. - I won't let you leave. You haven't even told me why there are no serial killers in Turkey. No, I mean I'm leaving the job, I'm quitting. I can't take it any more. This might seem a little strange... Everything stinks here. I stink. I can't even get close to Yasemin, I can't even hold her hand. In my dreams corpses talk to me, sliced arms strangle me. This is how we all started. Asiye used to make me leave the bed, because I smelled like a corpse. You get used it. I used to not be able to fall asleep but now I can cheep 24/7. I made up my mind. I'm going to marry Yasemin, I'm going to have a normal life. I'm going to make good money. Her dad's offering me a job as a manager at his meat restaurant chain. A woman got you worked up? This is how they do it. You know the grass belladonna? It's a plant. When you mix it up with arsenic it becomes an odorless poison. What a name; belladonna; beautiful woman. Women, they're beautiful. And they kill you slowly by poisoning. You don't feel the poison at first. It works its way slowly. Cut this marriage crap. Work hard at your job. This job is sacred, can't leave it for a woman. Not all women are alike. - Yasemin is different. - Idiot. Be with your woman. Be a slave to your father-in-law. Greedy bastard, meat restaurant future manager. I swear I'll come to your restaurant and I'll order a mixed stew. If I don't like it I'll pour the stew on your head. I swear. You're really crazy. They should lock you up. We found a hand and our lives changed. Kezban you can leave, you're already late. God bless you. You won't stop saying that, will you? What's wrong? - You look upset. - Forget about it. I won't. We always talk about my troubles in this house. - Police officer, talk! - What should I talk about? We really messed up this time, they're making fun of us. We made a fool of ourselves, it's worse than getting fired. I'm going to ask for my retirement... Yasemin? It's me. I thought about it. Based on principle I accept your father's offer. Ok. See you. Yes? Yes, dris? Lust wanted to apologize for today. You know I would never hurt Asiye. I still want to apologize, you are like a father to me. I'm sorry. I'm under influence and also a little sentimental. What was I saying? Chief, don't worry. We'll solve the case, I will never let you down. Take care. What's he saying? Drunk talk. I scolded him today. Then I regretted it. He's really hung up on Asiye. I've never seen anyone so obsessed with a woman. Congratulations. It takes great skill to break into a house like this one. I was in special forces in the army. What do you want? My wife does not want to get back together with me. Really? Too bad. When she said no to me today her eyes had a look... It wasn't pity, it wasn't hatred. She looked at me like I wasn't there. She has erased me. The other night. The electricity was out. She's beautiful, rebellious, stubborn. I was always faithful to her. She was my childhood love. You know I'm really screwed up because I came here. They'll probably fire me. That's not important. Asiye erased me so the rest doesn't matter. My people are a little strange. My case is closed but I'll close your case as well. You'll either confess or I'll kill you. Look young fellow. You're probably drunk. I understand you, I know the pain you're going through but you don't know what you're doing. I realize what I'm doing. She does as well. I promise you, if you leave now, I won't report you We'll forget this ever happened. All the records will be deleted. But get that gun out of my face. You know where the door is, get lost! You're not listening to me. Are you not listening to me? What did I say? I said you're going to talk. Talk, damm it! If you don't, you'll be dead. I'm serious. I don't have anything to lose Battal! On the count of 3... If you don't talk, I swear I'll shoot... Why did you kill the girl? What's said here does not count as evidence. Of course not. That's not important. What's important is why you did it. Hunter needs to know that personally. He'll trap you, you self-loving bastard! Stop! Calm down! Don't respond so I'll shoot you. - Say your prayers. - Stop. The reason is different. Stop. God damn you all! Lower your weapon! All surveillance tapes are taken and sent for investigation. The gun of the guard Muzaffer Turan will be sent to CSI... ...for ballistic research. His clothing will be taken... ...and he will be taken into custody. He was drunk. What time did he call Ferman? Around 9. I'm tired of it. It was definitely a self defense. That crazy guy was pointing a gun at me, look at the videos and you'll see. It happened just like I told you. It's all there. He was about to shoot Battal Bey. He aimed the gun at his head. He was swearing at him. I warned him and then he pointed the gun at me. There was nothing I could do. I didn't know he was a cop. The videos prove Battal Bey is right. I'm tired of seeing it. He has nothing to do with this. Let him go, Murat. Battal Bey, you can leave after your testimony is written down. But we'd like to know where you are in case we need you to testify again. Also could you show your wrists? Not without an order from the prosecutor. Today was a really hard day. Don't push my limits. That's alright. Okay. You can leave now. Don't forget what I said. Nice man you trained, a live bomb waiting to go off, and did go off. Don't make this about revenge, and don't get the press involved. See what he did there? Look at his hand. Slower. This is my gesture. "Change your perspective to see something new. " He's trying to say something to us. Perhaps, maybe he's saying change your perspective, ours... dris what are you saying, what are you pointing at? What did we disregard? Where's the opening? dris my brother, where are you? Murder covered by the entire earth will still reveal itself. Really? Interesting. - Shakespeare said it, in Hamlet. - Nice saying. I'm using it in my thesis. He has another; Murder does not have a language yet it will speak. But when? Would you want to read a crime novel if the crime is not resolved in the end? No, I wouldn't. - What are we looking for here? - Don't know. We're just looking. For something to change our perspective? Yes. Perspective. What else do you want from us? We don't really know either. We just came to chat. Tell us whatever you feel like telling. Tell us about Pamuk. What else can we tell? We told it all. It's enough. Pamuk was a really good girl. She had a beautiful voice. She sang really nicely. She was slender and fragile. She was very introverted. She was afraid of everything. One time we all went to donate blood. Her brothers, her dad. She was so scared. What was the blood for? - Sorry? - You were talking about blood. They asked for it from everyone. - Who asked for it? - The doctor. - Ceylan's doctor. - Why? They didn't tell us anything. All the staff at the mansion gave blood. They had said at the time that... ...all the employees at all the firms donated. The girl has respiratory failure. They're wary of infections. Why are they getting blood for that? This will be our last visit. Battal will make us fired. It doesn't matter to you. You're going to quit anyway. Who told you chief? You're telling me everyday without even realizing it. Did you check the patient's pulse? Yes, sir. It's normal. Let me know if her fever runs past 38. Doctor, do you have a minute. Just a minute. There was a mass blood donation here a while back. Why was that? I don't know. Must've been the previous doctor. Possibly for an operation. You should talk to him. What does it have to do with Ceylan? Battal Bey has strict orders. We can't talk to anybody about his daughter. Where can we find the previous doctor? Turhan Bey. Turhan Bey, are you home? It's the police Turhan Bey. Doctor Turhan, right? She was very little. She was very beautiful. I can't forget her eyes. I can't forget her screaming. God, what did we do? What you're looking for is right there. Pamuk's nail marks. Set this up. Rewind. That's the opening dris was poing at. - Yes? - I hope she gets well soon. How's your daughter? She's trying to cope with it... It's a difficult illness. My wife has it, too. - Kidney failure? Yes. She is tied to a dialysis machine three times a week. No transplants? Once she had the opportunity. But my wife, she's a little strange. A young girl who was also waiting for one, she let her have the transplant. She thought the girl deserved to live longer than her. Who would do such a thing in these times? That's life, now that girl is like a daughter to us. She looks after my wife, takes her to dialysis. - Any kids? - Not in the stars. After my wife's kidneys were damaged she was advised against having kids. We only have each other in this life. - But we learned to be happy on our own. - We never did. My daughter had a transplant but her body rejected it. I gave mine earlier, but it didn't work either. You know the donor for the most recent kidney? No. It came from outside of Istanbul. - Where can we find Battal Bey? - He is at the hunting lodge. He's trying to distract himself. Can you tell me how to go there? - You wait here. - What if I need to take notes? Not necessary any more. Would you like a cup of hot tea? Your dad's hunting rife? Good observation Hunter! You said; "Come back when you have something to say. " I did. I have something to say. I'm listening. I have to give you credit. You're a good hunter. You set up good traps... ...your hunt doesn't even recognize. You're right, traps don't suit a hunter... ...but catching your prey is more important. Just like the trap you set for us; Pamuk's cause of death. You had us searching the triangle of love... ...betrayal and honor. This is how it is in Turkey. Our murders are not very creative. That's why we've been stuck on this scheme. You pushed us into that direction. A woman who ran away from her husband... ...to her lover ora woman killed by her family. Or jealous lover. dris did what he had to do before he died. He told us to change our "perspective". We did and we saw. What did you see? The reason for the murder and the murderer. Blood and tissue samples were drawn from all your relatives and employees. Because your daughter has kidney failure and you were looking for a kidney for her. Pamuk's blood and tissue proved to be the only match among all the people. We have the lab reports to prove it. But there was a problem. How were you going to convince Pamuk? And the game started. You started playing the old man in love with Pamuk. You divorced your wife. You convinced her family and married her. They thought you changed her age to marry her. No. You changed her age so that she could give her kidney. But your game reached a dead end. Pamuk did not want to give her kidney, and ran away to her boyfriend. You took her back by force... ...and then you took her kidney. And you killed her. Despite all your threats... ...Acid was about to tell us why she ran away. You made her brother kill him. Vakkas still thinks this is about honor. This is it. What do you think? Let's take a walk. Maybe we'll shoot a couple of woodcocks. These are the last chances. Hunting season will be over soon. I told you to come back when you had something to say... ...but I didn't expect this much. These are serious accusations Hunter. Can you prove what you're saying, do you have enough evidence? Or are you trying to hit the target while shooting blind? We identified boot prints at the scene of the crime. We have the mold and the pictures. I'm certain that the boots you're wearing right now have the same print. There are also wheel prints. We have the mold and the pictures for that, too. I'm certain it belongs to your 4x4 at the door. The doctor who planned all this, his skin was inside Pamuk's nails. If not enough, I'll keep going. The anesthetic confessed. The doctor's computer contains the warning that Pamuk only possible donor is. If these are not enough, I'll identify your daughter's new kidney's DNA. I already have Pamuk's DNA in hand. I bet they'll be the same. Is that enough evidence? Pamuk is dead, Acid is dead. Pamuk's family is worse than dead. They lost their daughter. Their son is in prison. dris died. You destroyed so many people to save one life. How does your conscience feel? What matters is to be able to live with a guilty conscience. You trapped me. I thought you were no match for me but I was wrong. Ceylan has a special place for me. I don't know why. Maybe because of her illness, maybe because of her smile... ...or maybe because of the look in her eyes. I did everything to keep my daughter alive but all in vain. We spent our lives chasing kidneys. We looked everywhere. Bulgaria, Romania, Africa. And her body rejected the ones we found. My wife gave her kidney, it didn't work. I tried, it didn't work. We were left with poor Pamuk. I loved my wife but the marriage had to happen. I gave Pamuk a fortune but she didn't want to give her kidney. She said; "No". She said; "I won't give her kidney. " She ran away. I made her come back, I locked her up here. It was really bad. It was a nightmare. She made it really difficult for us. She screamed, tried to get away. We could hardly sleep her. One team took her kidney, the other was waiting... ...ready for the transplant. We took the kidney here. Then I went to the mansion with the team. Later... ...the doctor who was waiting beside Pamuk called. Said that she realized what was going on... ...started screaming, And she died of respiratory failure. I came back here. There was one thing left to do. What happened after all that bloodshed? The kidney didn't work. Now my daughter's immunity system is completely ruined. Ceylan is dying Hunter. My wealth and my power didn't help. - Ceylan is dying. - I understand your pain. Weird, you are capable of pain. I didn't think you were. You ruined a young girl. Then you tried to play a hunting game with me. I didn't see a single drop of remorse in your eyes. What sets apart a hunter from another is not his intelligence. It's remorse. And you don't have it. Pray God that Ceylan can die in peace without knowing what you did. No, never. She should never hear. This is where it all started. You can end it here. What happened? It's settled. We're leaving. Game season is over. Words are over. The songs are over. No more fall or spring. The sun won't rise above us no more. The stars won't wink. No more wind, No more snow. We won't smell the sea. No more rain on our skins. No more pigeons, olives. No more the taste of figs, no more red cloves. No more good or evil. Love is over, so is hatred. No more suffering... ...no more hardships. Our wound is no longer bleeding. We're no longer hurting. We're covered in white. We're left without shadows. We're left without shadows.
