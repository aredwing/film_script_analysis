Hey, aren't we on the top floor? - Yeah, I think. - That's what I thought. It's just that when I was in the bathroom, I heard this, like, weird creaking noise. It's an old house. You're right. Mmm! So, you want to go antiquing tomorrow? No, I want to go to the witch museum. The witch museum? Everyone goes to the witch museum. I know, but when in Rome... All right, witch museum it is. Thank you. Anything for my baby. But now we have to go to sleep, 'cause we have to get up early. Okay. - Good night. - Good night. Dan, I see you found the place. Yes, and I did not get lost this time. Gretchen, this is my wife, Jessica. Jessica, this is Gretchen. - Nice to finally meet you. - Hi. This is my aunt rose. She's the current owner. Rose, this is Dan and Jessica coffey. They're here to see the house. Hi. Your house is lovely. You'll have to excuse my aunt. This is very hard for her... handing over the business to strangers. - I'm sure you understand. - Of course. The house is over 350 years old. It's one of the oldest in all of new england, dating back to the early colonists. It needs some updating, but that's part of the charm. Wow. Great view. Absolutely. - It's nice, right? - Yeah. We have a main residence and then three guest rooms, all upstairs. - How long has it been a bed-and-breakfast? - 40 years. My aunt and Uncle converted it when they first bought it. If you don't mind me asking, why are you guys selling the place? He died about a year ago, a heart attack. It was very sudden. She tried to keep the place going on her own, but it was just too much for her. Did they not have a handyman or any other staff? No, it was just the two of them. My Uncle was the fix-it type. Liked to do things himself. So, what's gonna happen to her? Assisted living. We found a lovely place just a few Miles from here. I have to warn you, the upstairs is a bit of a mess. So what about all this furniture here? What do you guys plan on doing with it? It's included. It'd be too much trouble to move it. And besides, it belongs to the house. So, what do you think? Can we afford this? Yes. We'll be... We'll be fine. - Are you... - I promise. Okay. Let's do it. - Really? - Yeah, - if you think we can do this. - I know we can. Okay. - I love you. - I love you, too. This is gonna be great. Okay. Well, I'll go back to the office and draw up the paperwork. Pleasure doing business with you. Absolutely. Thank you very much. - Congratulations. - Thanks. I know running a b & b is crazy, but it's been your dream since as long as I've known you. I know. I just... Well, I guess it's our dream now. I am completely okay with that. - Okay. - Next time we drive up here, it's gonna be our home. Honey, where does this one go? Uh, the kitchen. Kitchen. Okay. Wylie, come on, boy. Excellent. Honey, I got the phone working. You want a gold star or something? Yes, actually, I Would love a gold star. Thank you. All right, well, why don't you order us some food on that thing? I'm starving. - How is it? - Okay. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Oh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Did we unpack the glasses? Hm-mmm. Not yet. Okay. This is gonna have to do, madame. Okay. A toast to our new home and business. Look at us. So classy. Okay, well, mine's... Do you want to know my lucky numbers? - Yes. No. I want to read you my thing. - What are yours? "Keep in mind your most cherished dreams in the future." - Oh, that's what We're doing. - Yes. And, um, "to catch a cold" is - huh? - Exactly. Hey, honey? What time do you want to wake up tomorrow morning? Mm, early. Like, 6:00 A.M. Okay. Excellent. We'll have breakfast in bed. What do you want, pancakes or waffles? Pancakes. I'm so tired. Yeah? Long day? Yeah. Hmm. Mm. - What? - What? I'm just checking out my gorgeous wife's incredibly cute ass. Can we do this tomorrow? Tomorrow? - Don't you know the rules? - What? You have to christen your new house in your new bed, or it's incredibly bad luck. - Rain check? - "Rain check"? Yeah, I'm tired. Did you pull that card on me? Okay, but remind me to oil the new bed for the rain check. - Sweaty dreams, baby. - "Sw... sweaty dreams"? Yes. You are cruel. - You love me. - Yes, I do. - Hi. - Hi. I forgot where I was this morning. Don't worry about it. It'll take some getting used to. So what's first on the agenda? Got anything? No. All right. Um... How about that one? Uh, no. All right, then. What about that one? Oh, yep. That's the kitchen. That... is the kitchen. All right. This one is a bit of a mystery. Okay, so I'm all done. Cool. Can you help me with some of these boxes? - Maybe. - Come on. Dan? Are you down here? Babe? Oh, hey. What is all this? Uh, I don't know. Some kind of storeroom, I guess. Oh. - Oh, weird. Look at this chair. - I know. At least, I think it's a chair. What is that? I don't know, but I wouldn't go touching it if I were you. That's pretty nasty. Why does it have straps on it? I don't know. You tell me. I don't know why There's a strap on it. I don't know. You're the smart one. So much for that rain check. Good night, hot stuff. I have to feed them. I'm waiting for you. Dan! Dan. Dan. Dan, wake up! Oh, dear. I woke you. No, I-I don't know how she got in. That's the point. We woke up, and she was in our bedroom. Yeah, okay. No, no, no, no, no. - What? - I'll call them. The children. Take care of the children. My Norman. My sweet, sweet Norman. This way, Mrs. Stanton. Such a nice girl. - Too bad. - I'm very sorry about this. Apparently, she just walked out. So she made it all the way here. Well, this is what she knows. This place, it's what she remembers. She must've walked through the woods. Without any shoes? How far is that? Um, they always kept a spare hidden outside. That's how she got in. You might want to change the locks, all the same. Gretchen said she didn't even have any kids. That just doesn't make any sense. Then what was she talking about? Babe, she's confused. She's old. I don't know. I feel like We're somehow taking advantage of her or something. Are you kidding me? You saw her. She didn't even know where she was. If it wasn't us that came and snatched up this place, it Would've been somebody else. At least We're good people. Give me one sec. Okay. Hello? So that was Roger. He wants me to fly out to Chicago. But I thought I had you for the next week. I'm sorry. Apparently There's some client I'm supposed to meet. It's really important. Okay. Sorry. Hey, babe, I'm heading into town for some supplies. - You need anything? - Nope. I'm good. - Okay. I guess I'll see you in a bit. - All right. Where did you get that weirdo book? It's not a weirdo book. I got it at the library. You know, that big building in town with all the books in it. Right, right, right. That place with the words on paper. - Yeah. - Oh. Anyway, so why are you reading it? I don't know. Thought I'd try to brush up on the region's history. Mm. You know, just in case our guests ask. That's very smart. Oh. Oh, babe, look, it's our house. It says here that the man who built it in 1665, Arthur march, was a carriage maker. Hence the name. That's clever. - You are such a dork! - I know. Oh, his wife, Lydia, was a midwife to the early colonists. Hmm. That's kind of cool. Oh, babe, listen to this. Look. "When a mysterious illness "plagued the colony's children, "Lydia was blamed for it "and accused of practicing witchcraft. She was tried and hanged in 1669." Can you believe that? Some kids get the flu, and immediately it's a woman's fault. What? Just, I love my little feminist. - Well... - So cute. Yeah, just... It's a little frustrating. - I love you. - I love you. - Hurry back, okay? - I will. Bye, wylie. See you later. Wylie? Wylie? You want to go for a walk? All right. All right. Come on! Come on! Yeah! Wylie? Wylie, come on, boy. Hey, what's up? - Is this your dog? - Yeah. What's his name? Wylie. Hey, You're the new owner of that inn, right? You mean the carriage house? Yeah, the old witch's place. - You, uh, want one? - Uh, no, thanks. I don't smoke. Hey, listen, I've got to get back. My husband's going to start to worry. You want to let go of my dog? Sure thing. Thanks. Come on. See you around. Wylie, come on. Wylie, come on. Let's go to bed. Wylie? Wylie. Hey, come on. Wylie, get away from there. Weird. Hello? Hello? Are you sure? Yes, Dan, I'm sure it rang, but it said it was coming from the east room. That's weird. It's probably just something wrong with the wiring. I'll check it when I get home. Okay, yeah. I guess I'm just being silly. Hey, I got to go, but I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Okay. Bye. Damn. Norman, you dirty old man. Jess? Sweetie, you in there? Honey? Hey, I'm home. Hey, there. You want some company? No, no, no, no. I didn't want you to turn it off. I just wanted to let you know I was home. Okay. Hey, is something wrong? I'm fine. I'm fine. Okay. You made quite the dent here today, babe. Yeah. I've been busy. I can see that. Tried calling you. Oh? I didn't hear the phone ring. I was a little worried. Hey, is everything okay? Yeah. I'm just tired. I haven't been sleeping too well. ,I missed you. I missed you, too. Hey. Where were you? Bathroom. Mm. You're so cold. Smells good. Wylie. Hey, buddy. You all right? Hey, is something wrong with him? He looks spooked. Wylie. No, I don't know. Honey... Have you been beating our dog while I've been away? You have, right? No, I Would never do that. I'm just kidding, Jesus. What's... were you doing a little, like, gardening before breakfast? Oh, I forgot to mention that. There's something wrong with the washing machine. It's flooded. Okay. I'll take a look at it. Hey, Jess, have you seen my hammer? Jess? Hey, Jess, you in there? Jess? What the hell is that locked for? Um... You didn't hear me a few minutes ago, trying to get in? - No. - What are you doing in there? Nothing. Just straightening up. You're straightening up with the door locked? I heard whispering in there. Babe, who are you talking to? No one. Think a raccoon just tried to Jack our car. - Wylie? - Wylie, come on. We're going upstairs, buddy. Hey. Upstairs. Wylie, come on. Upstairs. Come on. Come on. So... I was just wondering, um, what happened to your shirt. I tore it on a nail. You... you tore it on a nail, so you threw it out? I ended up using it as a rag. As a rag? You loved that shirt. - You got it on our honeymoon. - It got old. Hey, it's me. I mean, she's been acting a little weird lately. Moody or something. Yeah, that's very funny. No. You can... yeah, you can go ahead and tell her that, because I'm not gonna. Can you... can you hang on a second? Oh, you have got to be kidding me. Hey, can I call you back? Damn it! What the hell? Oh, Jesus. "Live feed"? Huh. My God. These cameras are still working. What the hell? Oh, hey. You're awake. Uh, I'm gonna run to the store, and I've got to fix the roof. You gonna be okay? I'm fine. Okay. All right, see you. You sure about this? The SUV is gone. I saw him pull out. What about the dog? Really, dude? Keep a lookout. Stay here. Dylan? Dylan? Eric? Come on, guys, this isn't funny. They're still here. Hey, honey, just want to let you know I'm home. What do we have here? Unbelievable. "October 27th, 1998." "October 27th, 1998." What's the matter? What do you think about - getting out of here for a few days? - When? I don't know. How about tomorrow? We still have a lot of stuff left to do here. I know, and we've been working really hard, especially you, with the unpacking and the renovations. I just think it Would be cool if we just took off and, uh, cleared our heads. I just think you've been working really hard, and you deserve... I'm not going anywhere until We're finished here. Dan? Where have you been? On a walk. Did you sleep in here last night? You were snoring. What... what's the matter with you? Nothing. Look, I don't know what I did to make you so mad and distant. Okay, maybe it was my trip to Chicago when I was supposed to be here for you, I don't know. I'm not mad. "Record." Hi. Mrs. Stanton? If you can just sign in here, and she's in room 119, on the left. Mrs. Stanton, do you remember me? Uh... My wife and I, we bought the carriage house. We're the new owners. Uh, Mrs. Stanton, the other night you mentioned something to my wife about the children. Did I? You don't... You don't remember that? Uh, did your... Did your husband ever mention seeing anything? You leave my Norman out of this. My husband was a good man! I'm sure he was. I just... I need to know if he, uh, saw anything unusual. That room... It was supposed to be a nursery. What room? The east guest room. Only, the wife couldn't have children. But that didn't stop her. Wait a minute. I remember you. Those children, the ones you've seen? I didn't mention anything about... They need to be fed. They should have burned her. Hanging's not enough. You need to burn her before it's too late! I'm sorry I've been acting so strange lately. It's just this house. That's... Totally fine. It's okay. Where are you? I know You're there. What are you waiting for? Jess? Let's see what you've been up to. Where'd you go? There you are. What are you doing? Hello? An... anyone there? Hey. You out for another walk? Yep. Are you all right? No, I'm not all right. I have a headache. I'm definitely coming down with something. Where's wylie? Don't know. You didn't take him out with you when you went for a walk? Nope. He wouldn't come. You said it yourself... he's been acting strange. Oh, he's been acting strange? Wylie? Hey, boy! Wyles! Come on! Come on! I'm sure he's just out for a walk. Hey, um, I'm just wondering, were you burning something in the kitchen earlier this morning? It's just some incense. "Incense." Okay, um, can you do me a favor and not do that again? Because it smells like shit. Just great. - What are you doing? - Jesus! What are you doing? I heard a sound up here. I was just investigating. Just go to bed. Jess? Jessica? Jess? Man, where the hell is she? Jess? Jess, you down here? Jess? What have you done to me? Let me out of this thing. Jess... There's an evil inside you, Dan. But don't worry. We'll get it out. Jess, wait. Just listen, okay? Stop it. Jess, Jesus! Jess, hey, stop. Please stop! Stay with me. You're crazy! You're crazy. I wasn't expecting you so soon. - Traffic was quicker than we had expected. - Ah. Hi. Hi. I have the perfect room for you. It's the east room, upstairs and to the left. Thanks. Enjoy your stay.
