He's looking for you Nino. For me?... He must be crazy?! His name is Antonio Platamonte. He's from Borghetto. In '71 he shot Menegelle, remember? In '74, he killed the Russo Brothers. He rang their doorbell, came in their house, and killed them whilst they drank their coffee. He's only ever been to jail for theft. OK, but I've never met him before? Nino, the first rule is that the intended victim should never have met the hit-man before! It's a fundamental rule, trust me! And know that I've had enough of your stories. Wait! Nino wait... he asked for you at the tobacconists. He asked where you lived and worked. In the meantime I'll keep an eye on him. Yes, he came here earlier and wanted to know where you lived and worked. Yes, that one. But he's not a spy... know it! What's up? Women! So, don't tell me.. We shared a cell in prison. Which prison.. or is that a secret? At 'Lucia Dorne'.. I'm always in 'Lucia Dome' That bastard once cut his wrists to get out of working! .. And then?... What if you insulted someone? Maybe when you were stealing cars you could have bothered the wrong person? No, we never stole from anyone important We'd give it back if we did. Are you involved in any family feuds? Why should be, my own family is enough. You must have done something or else he wouldn't be looking for you? He's heading for your stall, look! Wait, he may have a gun? He's looking at the stall. I'm Nino Peralta. You're looking for me. I'm here. Just wanted a glass of water with aniseed. The water and aniseed is on the house... .. because the stall is mine. And you knew this well. Why should? don't live round here. Thanks. You were asking at the tobacconists for Nino Peralta. At the to tobacconists! Ah yes! was asking for.. for Nino Veralda he used to live round here but guess got the wrong street? It happens! I'm paying... Thanks. Excuse me... He denied it all, eh? Expected it. Nino, if you tell me exactly what he said can translate it perfectly. I'm not interested. You know everyone and you know everything. You're the expert! I'm just not interested. And wash your hands they're scaring away the customers! Schirro, ask Mr. Patranka to give me a better deal? You're lucky Peralta. You started a business alone, keep complaining and your fortune could disappear. You tell him Mr. Ferrari, have to pay the installments on the stall and my poor daughter is sick. I'll pay, promise but just need some more time You know the owner of the bar on the corner? He's angry that you're affecting his trade. We have to keep him calm, so Mr. Patranka will have to raise you by fifty percent. Won't pay. Won't PW? You say you won't pay? Won't let anyone bleed me dry and you can tell that to Mr. Patranka! Go on Colicchia. Don't understand why we haven't looked to see what's happening there? Hope don't have to set foot in that shitty place again. The warehouse is always closed and no-one answers at Capuana's house. Capuana got scared and?ed. And he was right, cos he shouldn't have done it. It was a stupid idea! He's right. A STUPID IDEA! WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT! If you can't do it rig ht, don't do it. Schirro! Is that better now? Yes. And this? Around the neighbourhood where you lived before, more than half the babies had problems with their bones. This is the truth. So then, do you think I'll be well? If the doctor says you will, then you will. You'll get well because you're in a nice new home. You like it? Yes, before couldn't sleep at night because of the mice. Look at the news! Here there are no mice. Just like said. There aren't any, there aren't any. saw some! Where'd you see them? Don't leave the house Nino. In the courtyard. The courtyard is not in the house! OK, well done, they could still get in the house. So, when you've finished the first set of injections, then you should bring her over to my office. OK... how much do we owe you? We can think about that another time Miss. Thanks but it's not a problem now doctor. OK, make it 5,000 (lira) Daddy, were there mice in prison? Heh.. yes, and plenty of them! There are convict rats! Guess what we used to do with the mice? Played "hide and seek"! Really? Of course! All OK Colicchia? Good, thanks Miss Lucia! Doctor Ralo is a great person but he has too much imagination. Understand him but he doesn't have to keep thinking about you like that That's the nonsense of the day! Why are you carrying the gun? I'm selling it. If you go back to jail, I'll kill myself. Before went back would kill myself too. Nino, don't leave me here alone with the kids and without food.. That's the past Lucia. Don't you trust me? Is there something Nino? Yes, there is... .. it's being able to keep up with the installments. No attempt was made to prevent the gunman from escaping. The man was around 35 yrs old, dark hair, brown suit and tie. Yes, but that doesn't mean it's the same guy spoke to at the stall! Couldn't get a better description if you ask me! Hi Dad... Mum Lucia's upstairs, see you later. But does it say why he killed them? Could be someone who's tired of paying protection money?! God willing. Well, if it was your man who murdered Patranka, why would he want to kill me if never met him before yesterday?! We must find a motive! In my opinion... Let's suppose that Patranka had a fued with The Family? You understand? And secondly, something happened recently that no-one could have dreamed of until the last few years. The kidnapping of one lady. Who was the wife of the rich lawyer Vito Raul Marini! Where do fit into this!? I'm not after the wife of Vito Raul Marini! Didn't say you were. The fact is that they kept her hostage for more than a month! They threatened to murder her. But they let her return home, no? Saw it on the news, they decided to let her go. Someone made them let her go! And that's not all... Hey guys. Hey, Nino! Welcome back! This is a special occasion, we need to celebrate! Sentini.. Sentini.. Promise me all the cars stole were sent to Turkey, Libya or somewhere abroad? Middle East. Sure? Sure! You didn't let someone use any of them for a robbery or something that would get me into trouble? Do look that crazy? But this Patranka who was murdered yesterday perhaps you gave him one of our cars? Avoid certain circles, don't want to know. Nino... what is it? What happened to that beer you promised? Yes, understood! Can you tell me anything about the kidnapping of Miss Raul Marini? There's not much to say, it's a new group versus the old guys. The new guys had the idea of kidnapping the wife of the old boss, then, they said they'd kill her if she made trouble. This is my impression of it. But they let the lady go back home? Don't know what happened and don't care, try and keep out of these sort of affairs, and you've always done the same thing, no? Nino! Do you see that? A new high score. You know how a person can think he has a job, a family, good health - he's lucky, everything's good? But then, someone always spoils it by giving you bad news, like you did Colicchia! Nino, it's because you're a friend that told you. OK, but must you keep talking about this Platamonte? Don't even want the problem on my mind, OK? OK, forget it that Platamonte was looking for an old friend. Don't keeping talking about it or I'll really get angry! OK, won't say any more! For fuck's sake! It's mine, snatched it from the lady! Money! Let's count it! Trim it a little. Sergeant, always a pleasure to see you. Don't hold grudges. Peralta. But all these cars that pass by here, don't you get tempted at all? He's clever because all the money he got from the cars, he put away in the bank. And he found it there when he came out (of jail). He's the smartest car thief in Palermo. Why did he stop? Family guess but it won't last. I'm looking for Cicco Capuana's fish warehouse. You know it? It's there. It's been shut all week. They must have left a refrigerator open because we've had complaints about the smell. - See you around. - Goodbye. OK, let's go add these up. Did you find out why they murdered Patranka? He was on trial. What are you doing round here, eh? Saw that man! Which man? That... that one who wants to murder you. But nobody wants to murder me! Where did you see him? At.. at the barbers. I'll follow him. Forget following him and run back to school. Go! Go! Nino. There were four bullets. Two for Patranka, two for Schirro, what a perfect job, eh?! Perfection? You bet! What's wrong? - Just keep your mind on doing a good job with the cleaning. - Peralta! Go inside. What is it? Headquarters, this is Unit Two. Yes, yes, the Sergeant wants you. Go on! Headquarters. Who's that? Yeah, we need a lab team down here.. This Capuana, did you know him personally? Well, just as a customer. How is your stomach? Wish the smell was outside. It's not a pretty sight either. Christ! Why are you showing me this Sergeant!? They pulled out his fingernails. They're not pleasant people. Who is it? Capuana? No, it's not him. Then who is it? Don't know. Perhaps a watchman? Don't know! Want to show you another interesting thing. This... .. it's a prison to hold a kidnapped man... ...or a kidnapped woman? - Madam, please! - Over here! No photographs! No photographs! This way sir. (lawyer) Look, cover it up quickly! Madam... Sir. Let's do this quickly, please keep it short. Do you recognise the place? Let me through! Sergeant! So, they didn't just let her go then? One of them must have sold out, the other guys must have freed her. Others? But she'll swear they released her by themselves. Because the others, they were sent by her husband? Uh-uh, didn't say that. He was tortured! They pulled out his fingernails! They wanted him to talk! Already told you to get rid of those photographers! That's enough! No more photographs! Goodbye sir. Good day. This affair is going to start a rebellion. This is all you buy for the money you get? Found it. You should be in school. But learn where that man is, at a hotel, at Ballero. What's the name? It's called... Piacere Cortese. Go back home and don't tell your mum. And we'll have to talk about this again some time. The guy was tortured to death. The sergeant asked me if knew who he was, said no. Told you Nino, you should have kept away from Capuana! You told me? Told you Capuana was a friend of that guy, Saledino, and that Saledino is a friend of Ferrara, and that it's Ferrara who collects for Patranka! Ah, so Capuana is tied to Patranka? And when did you ever tell me this? You're always yakking and yakking, and breaking my balls Colicchia, but the one important thing need to know you don't even tell me! Nino, what do you mean!? You said if you started checking the criminal records of all your customers, you'd go bankrupt! Excuse me, one coffee please. - No we're closed. - It's closed! You always tell me that talk nonsense, that I'm like an idiot! You're worse than an idiot! You're a pensioner in prison, a failed purse snatcher.. a parasite! Look at yourself! Just look! What, so you're saying you're keeping me out of pity? Yes, that's just what I'm saying! Sebastiano Colicchia?! You know what say Peralta? I'M LEAVING YOU! Ah h, leave then! Colicchia... Colicchia wait! Go back to work. No, not even if you doubled my pay! And another thing, you better give me every last lira that you owe me! And my holiday in lieu. - And your Christmas bonus too?! - Yes! Everything. My friendship with you is finished. Can't insult me like that. - You're too touchy.. - Well, I'm easily offended. Colicchia wait! Where are you going, Colicchia? That's only my business and no concern of yours. Look here, Nino! They were looking for Capuana and they finally found his body on a train in Messina. They were too fast for poor Capuana! What things do they order? Capuccino and brioche (French pastry) in the morning, In the afternoon, coffee. For Capuana, sometimes mandarin punch. And you never saw anything strange? But how? For 3 weeks the woman was locked up in there yet they allowed you to enter and leave? Seems a little risky to me. Excuse me sir but to change their normal daily routine could have been even riskier for the kidnappers? Someone would have wondered what was going on in there? See you were a fisherman once, why did you change jobs? Quit when the Tunisian boats opened fire on us. And became a car thief! We needed to eat. Who holds the license for your stall? My wife. have a prison record. And how long did you do? Two years. Reduced for good behaviour sir. And why all this sympathy? I'm who arrested him. You can go. Really sir, look, wasn't even in Palermo! Thanks Sergeant. You know, I've been having this suspicion that Nino Peralta really was implicated? And was wondering what part you played, of the lawyer or the gang that kidnapped the woman? Because here we have a very serious situation. But you know me, always mind my own business. Good! was hoping that had made a mistake... You're a good man, eh! Go home and take care. Goodbye. I'll go! Dad, you were meant to talk to me about women? Ah yes.. women.. .. Women are.. .. Women are... Important? Yes, important but that's not all... It's Colicchia but he doesn't want to speak with daddy, he wants to speak alone with mamma. Who is it? Colicchia's here. Come in Colicchia.. something to eat? I'm not a parasite! OK! OK! Sebastiano Colicchia has never been a parasite! Understand, now sit down! Serenella! How come the kids are still awake? To bed, the two of you. Gotta go now. There's pasta with sardines... it's still hot. The one who gave the order to kidnap the woman, and the ones who actually did it. The jailers Don't tell every thing to her, you can tell me too. And the ones who fed her. Who decided this? Word is all around town, they planned it so everyone can count the executions, one by one. And so, everyone will now who's in charge. So... the watchman, that's one. Schirro, two. The third is Patranka. Four is Capuana. To make eight, they need four more. Say the fifth is Ferarra who is... The sixth, Saledino who has also gone undercover The seventh, what think, is Giovanni Fortunado Lamantia who is a friend of Patranka. The eighth, don't know. And you look at me?! But you told me to talk to you. But how is it possible that the guy that they tortured would mention Nino? There's no reason to? Don't believe he mentioned my name. And want to talk to that lawyer Raul Marini! Whoaa! He's in Switzerland! And the Madam has to recover from all the excitement. And then when when it's died down, these people will be free of any dirt! And who is it who's dirty? Who organized this group of killers? They're friends of course! No, this is all crazy, they can't get away with murder, I'll go and talk to that man at the hotel, and say 'Watch out', I've left a detailed letter at the police headquarters, that's right! Police headquarters! It will say if anything bad should happen to my husband, the you'll be responsible for it. Then what will they do? Whoever sent him here will send him back home. You see? And then they'll send another who don't know to shoot me when it's all quiet. Miss, these things are made up of groups of three... or four. Each one must concentrate on the person they have to eliminate. Remember the building war? They said six and six went. And the feud in Sierra Di Falco, they said eleven and eleven were eliminated. To hear how he recalls it, you'd think it was funny. But I'm not being funny, this all made history. Need my injection! This guy Lamantia, does he count? More than the others. What will we do if Daddy dies? Don't say stupid things. He would be better coffin prison. Don't worry, Daddy's not going to get hurt. Go to sleep. Goodnight. Thanks Miss Lucia. I'm going to see someone who think can help. - Are you carrying your gun? - Yes. Be careful, can't see that man. Who are you, a sentry?! You should stay at home. Must speak with some people. - At night? - Yes But won't be long, you go to bed and will continue our talk tomorrow. Like him, he's sharp! Tell me about this Lamantia. The war started when Lamantia returned from the north, he's very ambitious and planned to climb right to the top of the ladder! Don't know any Nino Peralta. Run the kiosk near the fish warehouse, it belonged to Capuana. Don't know any Capuana! He knows Capuana, he knows. We'll see. We'll see what? You can't go to Lamantia's house, that's crazy, you'd be a sitting target! What should do? Lock myself in the house? Run away? Want to stay alive Colicchia, the sooner we sort this out, the better. Common... well? Damn it! Understand, wait for me here. It's still Peralta, Mr. Lamantia. I'm not interested. We have to speak about the kidnapping of Mrs Raul Marini. Stand still! Don't move! - Yes, but don't get upset. - Luigi, search him. Inside! Easy, you see just came here to talk. Keep still, keep still! Don't bring him any closer. Talk about what? What kidnapping? Nino Peralta from the kiosk! Which kiosk!? What do you want? What do you want?! There is someone who has been told to organize all of these killings by a certain well known lawyer. What's the name, you must tell me. Did he have a weapon? You bring a gun into my house!? My life is being threatened over a kidnapping that had nothing to do with.. and you know very well about this. If you're honest, you should say so. Who sent you? I'm on my own. came for myself. Tell me the name of the person. But what name? Everything is quiet here. It's quiet! Tell him the name! Tell him! How much do you want to kill an enemy of ours and yours? Tell me a figure? Tell me! Watch that trigger! It can go off easily! Quiet... Quiet... Quiet!.. Idiot! You'd reveal anything he asked you. Nino Peralta, huh?.. The drink stand? You delivered drinks to Capuana's warehouse... bet the spy was YOU! And you took our enemies to Capuana's place! And the watchman.. who cut his throat? Did you do it? Don't want to kill you cos don't want a corpse in the house! Don't shout Giovanni! And wouldn't know where to hide it! - They found the driver, he'll be over at once. - Good! Bring my jacket and suitcase. And you remember, this is an honorable household Don't worry the boys are staying. They can walk ahead of me. Why do have to pay for your dirty war?! What war? Who's fighting? Get moving! You should be ashamed, disturbing people in their own homes. No! Stop! Him first... make him go first. Go ahead, get moving! Give me back my pistol. But what do you need the pistol for, uh? My briefcase.. my briefcase, go and bring it. Get out! What if need to defend myself? What do you mean? Everything is quiet here. - Outside! - Get lost! Out! What are they doing with my briefcase? You still here, get lost! Hide your pistol Luigi. What is it Dad, you feeling bad? - You shouldn't smoke. - Here's your briefcase. The car's here! Hi guys, was sent by Santino. Be right with you... Do everything told you boys. Look after yourself, for heaven's sake. Important thing is to keep calm.. and look after your mother. Goodbye sons. - Oh, the exams!.. Be sure to take them at University like we said? - Yes, OK. Look who's here! - Hey, Patrizia - you've put on weight! - No, didn't. - Ho! - What do mean "ho"! What you doing here? Finally get your nerves up? How'd it go with Lamantia? He's run off. need a pistol. You had one though? Need another, take this. Bring it to my house tomorrow morning. Nino you mustn't go home, it's dangerous, they might be waiting for you. Stay with me! And share a bed with you and that blonde with the fat ares? No, left her, moved out. Where? To Lega It's a hostel for workmen. Not too fancy, but it's more safer than a hotel We're agreed, right? The first that farts, he dies! Heh...The Baron! Listen, how much do they pay these professional killers? Depends. On the urgency, difficulty or the person in question. From 5,000 to 5,000,000 And for me.. how much? A million, a million and a half. You ever shoot anyone? Yes. It was a question of honor, not for money. That's why you were in for 11 years? No... that was for another thing. It was over a woman... she was a lady.. You!? Why not me?... "You"?!.. Got a discount. - Good - No Nino, bad! Look at this. Lamantia.. last night.. look. The driver. What you gonna do Nino? I'm starting to get fed up of all this. OK, but what are you going to do now? If there is going to be shooting, we'll shoot. What is it this time? Stop your play-acting, know that you're looking for me. In my opinion it's the opposite, you're looking for me! You tell then Nino Peralta, is not connected with Petranka, nor Capuana, and even less with Lamantia. Ah! Perhaps you're speaking of this Lamantia? Tell them that Capuana was just another customer of mine. They've got me confused with someone else. OK.. um.. who do have to tell this to? Whoever gave you the assignment. Ah.. the assignment.. excuse me but what assignment? The assignment that you can't carry out any more because now know who you are! And the money they promised you, you'll never get it! Excuse me but does everyone in Palermo act like this? I'm minding my own business and suddenly have to answer all these questions! Why are you in Palermo? Why am... I'm enjoying the lovely sights of the city, including your face! And if you must know I'm visiting an old friend of mine, OK? We'll go to him together. No? Perhaps he's someone that knows Raul Marini? Look, don't understand.. Something like this would have to happen to me!? Please, just leave me alone! Can pay you... can pay you more than they can. Listen! If there's anyway can be of service to you I'd be delighted but.. but.. please just leave me alone.. Can pay you more than you can imagine. Much more. So you won't have to go back to Borghetto... ...empty handed Mr. Platamonte By the way, a friend of yours would like to say hello. Look familiar? But what? You don't want to say hello to someone you shared a cell with? Me?... With... Ha-ha! With him? With this old bum! Hello Platamonte. We both... stayed in prison together? You got mad because snored. Don't know what to say, don't have a criminal record, In fact, I've never done any time in prison... I've got an ID card.. um, if you'd like to see my identity card? - What was that name? - Platamonte? And here, what is written? Domenico Cirilli from Caltanissetta, there you go! You made a mistake. Show me your wrists. Wrists? Who are you two? What do you want with me? I'll be reporting this! Nino, if got the wrong person, that's better, no? Bye Colicchia... Bye Nino. See you tomorrow. Just look at this kid... Is it alright to come closer? Is it too late for a coffee? It's small... but in a good location. Here we are! I'll admit you had me frightened this morning, everything you were saying seemed a little... strange? Assumed you were crazy. Mentioned it earlier in a restaurant to a friend, and told him that I'd met a madman! But he... wanted to know all the details. He's been reading the news. He connected all the facts, the names... those guys - Patranka.. Lamantia.. .. And all the others that have been eliminated. And he told me what if this Peralta turned out really to be an honorable person, who by pure chance.. or misfortune, has found himself in a very difficult situation? Heh, look how things sometimes turn out. This friend of mine told me he knew a person... who has a lot of contacts.. .. That can help.. Let's say, he could be the right person? One that would know Raul Marini? No, he never mentioned this name. My friend telephoned and spoke to the person who he knows, and that person who knows about these things explained the situation. And things for you... don't seem good. Tell me about it. You forgot to mention... about the cup. The cup, what wrong with it? That cup's alright isn't it? Oh, there's nothing wrong with this cup. This cup is innocent! I'm speaking of the cup that was left at the spot where the kidnapped woman was held. They found lipstick on the side, the kind that the Signora uses. Now, these people entered before the police did and they took the cup and gave it to the person who my friend knows. OK, so they found a cup... and so? 'Bar Splendour'! But what need is there to print it on them? Publicity? And now that person is convinced that you're working with the kidnappers. But deliver to all sorts of places! But that place was where they'd kidnapped Signora. You were delivering to that place every day for Capuana. And maybe you brought.. don't know.. magazines?.. .. Things to eat? Cigarettes? Want to speak to this person. Let you speak to him? Peralta, where do you think you are?! In Paris?! In Amsterdam?! Eh? Let you speak to him? You speak to me! Speak to my friend and he's the one who speaks to that person he knows, but we take separate steps to get there. But, there is some hope. Goon. This person... this person at the top... Don't ever listen to people when they say they are men of honor, men of honor! No don't. Because they're nothing but rats, the higher they are the lower they get! Know, know, let's wrap it up. My friend told me that this person wants to make a profit out of your situation And so he said fine can help but, what's his name? This Peralta, can he find 20,000,000 or so?... Twenty million? Why, how much you got? Not much.. not much at all. The kiosk... must've cleaned you out. Sell it. Sure, selling quickly is bad. But, thank God you have it. Imagine if you had nothing! To buy this had to spend two years inside.. TWO YEARS! Know how you feel... that you think of me as an enemy because tell you bad things you don't want to hear. But I've only told you the truth. That there actually is a list. And that your name is written underneath Capuana's, Schirro, Patranka and Lamantia don't know... if you want them to cross it out... But have you actually seen the cup? First you came to me and offered to pay me real well, Now, your asking me if the cup really exists! And this kind of talk... won't achieve anything. We can talk about this another day. Tomorrow, when.. when you've thought about it well. Dad, what did he want? Why was he talking to you? Come here. Help me count the cups, those under the counter. - Why? - Shut up, just count. Won't let them get away with a thing like this. A cup with lipstick on it. Won't fall for it.. trying to put me on the spot. - How many did you count? - 15 There's a mistake, there should be four more? You dropped one of the cups on the first day. Ah, yes. Colicchia broke another and so did a customer. That leaves one. Did you break it? - No! - Yes, you broke it! I'd have told you. - Maybe you were afraid I'd punish you? - didn't swear! - Tell me you broke it son! - It's the truth! - Say you did it! - Leave me! You're hurting me! It's important, you understand!? Can't have left it in there! And all you can think about are these dirty pictures! Told you to stop reading these magazines! You should be ashamed of yourself! Dad... Dad.. you didn't hurt me.. Can just imagine this huge organization hiding in the shadows, and signing all the death warrants. Can picture the scene... Stay calm sir... Those that must pay will pay. How many are there? Six? Seven? OK. Ah! And that worm... that Peralta.. the one who left the cup. We can put him down too to make eight. A nice round number! - Can borrow some coffee, forgot to get some? - Yes, yes. Evening Signora The more murders there are, the better it is for that son of a bitch... What's one more or less? In Palermo there's one dead every day. And they've reduced me to the level where take it out on my own son. What about that friend of yours?... That sergeant? Why don't you ask him to help you? He's suspicious of me.. a cop is a cop. If ask him for help he'll put me inside. And prison is the best place to murder someone Lucia. Where could hide? Nino!... Nino! always collected all the cups, from here and there and everywhere! Brought them all back and counted them too! Miss Lucia, I'm telling the truth! OK, you didn't forget them then. Well then, why are you angry with me? How else do you expect me to feel? The fact is we're both out of work. Both me and you! It's OK, don't worry, I'll manage... Good day Miss Lucia! Better find myself some work! Palermo lost again! Lucia... did you hear that, how unlucky... Palermo lost again. Yes, at home! Where is he? Who? That person. You didn't think he'd come here himself? Suppose you're here to represent him? At the notaries you find frontmen.. that's the way these things are done. But what's wrong? You're nervous, you're trembling! Yes! Yes! Because may get into trouble over you! Ah, you blame me?! I'm compromising my reputation for your life! Well then, should thank you! Come here! Don't be afraid Lucia, he won't shoot because he knows still haven't signed over the kiosk! Pull out your pistol then! Shoot, hired killer! Shoot! Shoot! What have you done to him Nino! What have you done? I've done nothing! You piece of shit! Stand up and let's talk! Tell me the address and name of that person, Tell me where he's hiding! Who is it?! Who is it?! - Don't know! - You don't know, huh? Well then admit it is you who's trying to take my stall! YOU! YOU! People are coming! I'll never help nobody any more! Even if had to spit blood from my mouth! Come here, you shit! I'M AN AMBASSADOR! An ambassador of shit! What else are you going to touch with your sticky hands? Crumbs! - Are you the Peralta's? - Yes? You're late, there are documents to sign, don't argue near other peoples houses! No can't do it Lucia, can't sign. Love, don't worry about it. Together, we'll find a way. Yes, jail. No, it doesn't matter, to help I'll even scrub?oors. As long as you come back home then.. No, I'm not going back to that slum. No. Let's go... let's go. Mr. Inpinna? Mr Inpinna is the new owner. Mr Inpinna, come in! Please. It's all ready immediately. Just two deeds to sign. Here also. There, it's done. Inpinna! One day you'll pay for what you've stolen from us! Don't think you're going to enjoy it for long! You'll be sorry! Nino, does this mean we must lose everything? You open that stall in competition, then you steal my customers, and look, now you show up here looking for work! Is it a yes or no? Ah! see you still like to be your own boss! So, what do you want to do? Want to be behind the bar? Well, figure you won't take orders from me cos you're rebellious! Understand. But... if you're starving at home, why not send your boy over to do our deliveries? Go fuck yourself. Nino, must talk to you. Come here! Let's go in the back. He thinks he's God almighty! This is the intermediary, speak to him! What have you done before? Waiter, carpenter, mechanic, garage hand when you're out of work you'll do it all. Place at the naval dockyard? Sure! Who'd have thought that today I'd find work already! About time! A million and a half. A Yea r? For me. For finding the position. And for me, how much? Hm, it's OK. Can give you 100 a month? No, all in advance payment. Middle-man... - Hey, fuck you! Why didn't you say first? Everyone knows this. Yeah, they know you're an arsehole! Hey listen! When you were away sometimes your woman would come and do the cleaning.. the windows and mirrors.. Send her back again if you want? What did you mean by that? Didn't mean any disrespect. Get off you shit! - You apologise or... - Nino! Calm down... don't do anything stupid! They are just trying to provoke you. Be careful you have a police record. Look at this Nino. Ah, you've started again! Only out of necessity and always return their documents why don't you have a look? You're not still angry about that cup are you? I've forgotten about it Colicchia. It's finished then. You know you've always been my best friend. - Baciamo we mani - Baciamo we mani ("We Kiss the Hands" - Mark of respect) Now I'm off to the station, it's the best time for work! Be careful you don't get caught. Me, caught? Paolo! He's been arrested! Why? He stole a car radio. Give him to me. This time you can have him back. No, Dad won't do anything. He has pocket money, his father is respectable, so why did he do it? - He inherited it - Look he used this knife to do it - Be careful, you could have a problem there. - Mm, thanks did it to pay the rent! Let your Dad take care of that. Don't shout at him. Go and buy something special for our lunch. - What for? - What for? Well, today we celebrate his first time... Shut up! .. We celebrate life. I'll get the wine. Nino! Is it true that you're coming back to the neighbourhood? No, I'm buying a penthouse in the middle of town... with a swimming pool! Peralta, you've made me look a fool! Come, let's talk! Want to drop that stall on your head! You've dragged me into the whole mess, dam n it! My friend went to talk to that person but they wouldn't let him open his mouth cos in these matters you need to tell the truth Peralta! What 'truth' are you talking about now? It's not hard for a coffee mug to be in a warehouse by chance, that's a fact, but to get to Lamantia you go to his house at night on purpose?! Yeah, went there... .. because wanted Lamantia to admit wasn't an accomplice. And how did you find out that Lamantia was one of the gang? Huh, Peralta?... Only an accomplice would know. But everyone knew that Lamantia was part of the group against Raul Marini? Had to do something. Listen. think you could be telling the truth, but that person doesn't think you're telling the truth. This person says you went to Lamantia who's your boss to receive precise instructions. And, can tell you another thing, you paid Capuana to protect your stall for you. Not Capuana. Patranka. Who was a friend of Capuana. They were the power around here. Peralta, you've got it wrong! The real power round here is only one person.. one person! Well, if we speak with this person... .. who stays out of sight... like some sort of spirit. Do you know Ferrara? He was one of the collectors. Then you know him well? He was around every week. In my car. Does Ferrara know you weren't in on it? Sure he knows.. but what help is that? Suppose he testified for you to that person? Ferrara?! You think he'd come out of hiding and get his head blown off to help me!? "Died Saving Nino Peralta"! What are you saying? Don't worry... - - don't know why I'm doing this to help you! What do get?... Especially after that beating you gave me.. You're tough, have poor health and a bad heart. But hope when this whole story has finished that you'll remember what did for you? You will be right? At that balcony lives a.. how should say... 'free (loose) woman'. Got a cigarette? What are we doing going to a whore? We're not.. but Ferrara is. Know what you're thinking. That he should be more careful. But he's not in hiding, he's not scared. He's not on the list. Maybe should explain, he is pretending to hide, so that no-one will know that he was the spy, the one who told the other guys where they were keeping the lady.. but of course he was. The amount of times dreamt of having a cigarette whilst in jail. Where did you do you bid? At Scivi Di Vecchia And you were where? You didn't really believe that was Domenico Cirilli from Caltanissetta did you? Platamonte from Borghetto. Pleased to meet you. There he is. - You sure? - I'm sure. Wait. But we have to speak with him? Let's go somewhere and have a coffee! But don't we need to speak with Ferrara? No, common let him mess around with that woman first. If you were interrupted at a time like that, what would you say!? - And who are they? - Who? Stop! Where are they going? - What do you mean? - Give me the keys! Stop the car! STOP! Watch it or I'll shoot you! Shoot who? Shoot! Go ahead shoot, you son of a whore! Come back "cornudo!" Cornudo! (A man whose wife sleeps with other men) Peralta Cornudo! I'll have a coffee by myself! Murderers! Don't let them get away! You should have come for coffee, it was delicious! Dirty traitor.. swine! Swine? Who's a swine? That Ferrara took it up the ares, Always talking, always talking, You knew what he looked like, our job was to identify him, you gave us the answer and thank you. But don't forget he's one of those who got you into trouble by kidnapping the Signora, understand? And you're weeping for him and running down the street as if it were the Olympics! Don't shout, you idiot. OK, if you prefer me to whisper. Your name is still on the list. I'm waiting at the snooker hall in the market, get over here at once or I'll pass the contract on to someone else. What luck I'm having... Well then, what do you want to do? Amateurs! I've been reduced to shit Lucia. Don't say that! And what should say? Don't say it because it's not true. Have take orders and obey like a piece of shit! You have to do better than that if you want to win! You're not concentrating. If tell that person I've investigated well, that Nino Peralta's innocent, he'll believe me. And you know why he should believe me? Because you'd be talking against your own interests just kill me and get your money. Go on. Go on! I'm sorry but why do you look at me like that? Was the one who forgot the coffee cup? Was the one who signed your death warrant? Nino, we're both victims! Get it into your head! The two of us! I'll say one thing, I'm ready to give up 2 million lira to save your skin. And you expect me to believe you? Of course! I'm ready to give up what that person offered, but you will have to help out. Ah, well then, I'll have to give it to you. And my family? How is my family supposed to eat? How? Am supposed to come out of all this empty handed? Whether you're guilty or innocent, tell me why shouldn't shoot you! Why should can't shoot!? Because might shoot you first. You wanna take the risk? Fucking Platamonte from Borghetto! You'd like to kill me now wouldn't you. Well then, why don't you do it? But what will it get you? You see Nino... we are both caught in something that's much bigger than us. But there is one way to screw them. You save your life and take home my two million. Understand? And what do you want from me after that, huh? My furniture? My bedding? But what do you take me for? Only want the money that was guaranteed when came here to Palermo to do my job. Two million. But what is two million for a life? Bring it to me tomorrow evening at 'Bar Piccadilly'. One last effort, then you can finish this!? Bring me some cars, you're the specialist. That's the past. Got these two kids now, they're quick! But I'm always happy to look out for you, if you can bring me some small cylinder semi new cars, I'll pay a good price. 300,000 a piece! To make what need I'd have to bring in 7 or 8 by tonight. What's the rush? Doesn't concern you. Well then, bring me a Jaguar or a Mercedes, a new one. - No - But if it's urgent... there are lots of jewelers and banks.. Can't do it. Every pro must first start at some point. My friend, we're just talking and talking here, but you know very well came here for you to give me the money. Don't have to give you anything. With all the things that I've done for you, and you didn't even go to jail, if I'd have given them your name, you'd have been in there with me! What are you doing?! You get mixed up in something dirty and you want me to get in trouble with you? There one thing you can do, it's what said. Tell mamma I'll be back late. Well? Want to come with you. No, have to look for work Don't lie. Don't make be angry, go back home. No, I'm coming with you! You have to learn to do as you're told, understand? Now go! Nino, did you speak to your friend? What did he say? Nino! Where are you going!?? He's gone to do a robbery. Take this upstairs. - Can get a loan from someone? - From whom? From Doctor Ralo? And why do you think he would do it? Because he's a good person. He looked after our girl lots of times when you were inside. Yes, know, know. Don't get any crazy ideas. Tell me what you're thinking, OK? I'm thinking it would be funny if on top of all this you were.. (sleeping around) could murder you! Yes, well everyone wants to murder me these days! Of course was bored and missed us making love. Didn't you miss it too? If one day your cell door opened and a girl walked in what would have said? 'No thanks, I'm faithful to my wife'?! Tell me, please. You'd have done it, no? Me too, if a man would have appeared in my room, would have made love. What do you mean? Nothing! That thought about going to bed with Dr. Ralo but didn't do it. You have a wife who was faithful to you for two years, OK!? Didn't go to jail to have a good time! Respect you but don't insult me. Go back home Lucia. Nino, they could kill you here. Don't worry won't give them the chance. I'm not that stupid. I'm just waiting outside to speak to a client. But what if they shoot straight away? Know but don't worry it'll be quiet. Now go back home Lucia. - No Nino, not the bank! No! - Go home.. go home. Go! No, wait! Watch what he's doing. Who? The customer with the Jaguar... if he starts writing there plenty of time. Give me a signal. Take this and hide it under your shoal. - How are you Emilio!? - Hi! Stop! If that boy dies could get 20 years. Don't worry, he's not dead! Went and looked at the hospital, all he did was hurt his head... ...and break one leg. Didn't want to hurt him. Didn't want to hit him but he jumped in front of me! They'll never catch you anyway. Bring the supper to your father. It was a red Jaguar! I'm back at the old game. - It's like it's destiny Lucia. - No! That man called. He said he can't make the appointment but at 7 o'clock Bar Piccadilly he'll send a person he can trust that you can hand over the money to... a woman. And why can't he make it, did he say? Just that they'd found out the address of a certain Saledino and that the rest you'd understand? OK, I'm going. Wait. Colicchia! Colicchia? Are you going to wait for me or not? Who did this to you? Cornudo! (A man whose wife sleeps with other men) was with two friends on the bus, had my hand on his wallet when the bus went over a bump and dropped it on the?oor! OK, OK. Here. No don't want to bother you. No. Buy yourself something decent to eat, you'll feel better. Thanks. Nino, have tell you something... get it off my chest. Did it. I'm the one who forgot the cup! Don't worry about it. How can not worry about it? For something like that should jump in front of a train! - Can go now? - Yeah sure, go. You're a pal. But who are you? But didn't you say the appointment was at the bar? At the bar? Ah, of course! Sorry, got a bit confused, it's my fault! I'm sorry. You'll find him if you go to the bar. If it's OK with you, think I'll wait for him here. Go and get your father! No, stay here. It's cold outside! Mmm.. stew with beans, eh? Smells wonderful! Too bad because my stomach is in bad shape, I'm not blaming your husband though. But beating me up certainly didn't do me good. Why are you staring? What's wrong? Please... leave us alone... Do you have problems with your nerves? Go away! What are you doing!? Nothing! Nothing! You don't think I'd hurt a boy do you!? You, stay in there.. - What's the meaning of this? - There, great! You get in there too, keep him company! What do you want to do? Keep quiet and nothing will happen to you. - Let us out! - Save your breath! Let us out! Said keep quiet! That was a gun. Like father, like son. Be good... be good. Was sent by Platamonte. - There he is! PAPA! - NINO! Be careful, that man is here! Papa, watch out! Papa, watch out! - It's that man Nino, careful! - Papa, be careful! Be quiet! Be careful! Peralta, don't move! I've got your girl! Good night. You too Paolo. You sleep there tonight. That man was really frightened. Don't believe he'll be back. Maybe he won't but his friends might? They've taken everything from us and it's done nothing. That traitor hasn't spoken to anyone about me. He's just cheated and stolen from me. Now he has to do the job he was hired for or it's his ares. Who is it? Open Peralta, it's the police! Don't open it! Open in the name of the law. But who is it? It's Officer Corleo, we're not here to arrest you. Common, open up Nino! What's happened officer? You have to identify the body of a man who was killed last night. It's in there. Recognise him? - Yes - What's his name? Colicchia Sebastiano Colicchia A man arrived here late last night, asked for bed and laid down without getting undressed. At some point in the night Colicchia got up and went to the bathroom. The other guy went in. Shot him with a silencer and left quietly. - Average build about.. - 35. - Light suit - Hazel! OK, brown then. Moustache. Glasses. With a tie. Yes OK, he was also wearing a tie. So then, do you recognise who the killer could be? Sir, the Prosecutor is here. Do you know him? No. - May? - Good morning Commissioner Good morning sir. - Firearm? - Yes, yes firearm. Yesterday at Monreale they murdered another associate of Capuana Enrico Saledino, and that makes seven. Now that the delivery boy has paid, that's eight and the game is over. But didn't you ever suspect what Colicchia was up to right under your nose? Cunning guy eh? No, he wasn't very cunning. Not very smart to die like that. You know what really thought? That the eighth was you. And why me? Why Colicchia? Yeah, why Colicchia... He's being buried instead of you. I'm almost pleased that it's ended this way. Forgive me Lord. Go back home now Lucia, have to speak to someone. - Can have some money for the shopping - Yes. That enough? - That's enough, bye - Bye Nino! Nino! Imagine meeting you like this! I'm Arminize! Arminize? Yeah, Cece Arminize your old friend! You don't remember me? We used to play together when we were small! Ah yes, remember. They told me you had a successful business which pays well. Said what sort of business is he in? They said 'He opened a drink stall'. Sol passed by to have a look but never see you there? Sold it. You sold it? What do you do now? Nothing. I'm looking for work. You're looking for work? Come on, come on! think can help you. Let's talk for a moment. Come on! Must introduce you to someone! I'm so glad that we met like this! Why are we here? Always try and avoid this street. There's my drink stand. - Alright you're closing down. Don Vincenzo says. - Why? You heard why! - Go home now! - Give me the keys. Keep still. Don't say nothing. Quiet. Nino Peralta! You were supposed to be dead by now but a friend of yours has died instead. How do you explain that? You're asking me that? Am Vincenzo Fabbricante. Do you know me? Am just a poor man. don't know those that count When you don't know anyone who counts you must watch your step very carefully. And you have to be very careful now because can imagine what you'll say to save yourself. Whose signatures are these? Mine and my wife's. Ah, and this Mr. Inpinna you handed your stall to. You know him? He's a frontman. A frontman? For Vincenzo Fabbricante? My friend, I'm not interested in peddling coffee. Didn't trick you out of your stand and your two million. You've some funny ideas in your head Peralta. Would you like to know how much we were offering for you.The whole price? Added your name to the list... because of this. And ordered that babbler Platamonte, to look after it. And so, it was for that? Used my.. my intuition.Which you confirmed. At first you were just a friend of those 'cornudo's' who insulted a Signora that they shouldn't have dared to even think about. Then, you became a guilty party. Acted the way did because you had a knife to my throat! Like punishing a man before he is guilty. That's just talk!... Chatter! So asked Platamonte, how come Peralta is still alive? And he'd say tomorrow, tomorrow! Then he tells me that Peralta isn't the culprit any more, it's his assistant. The same bar. The same cup. But another person. So go along with it, if only for my sense of justice. And then, start hearing of.. of some news. The information received was very different And come to know that since he wasn't able to kill you he killed another person, just to make eight! But.. basically.. It was meant to be eight anyway. And eight it was. A lesson has been taught. We're going to tear down the whole place. And make a beautiful building with 8?oors! But what about you? What are we going to do with you Peralta? You can at least feel a little repentance? Are you repentant? Yes or no? Then how'll you prove it? The old way was to kneel for forgiveness which was a serious gesture. So then Peralta? Go ahead, they're watching you. The church is great because the secret of confession is known to only two people. The priest and the penitant. And only God bears witness. And there is absolution and penitence. Now take your things and leave. No, not that... it's a 'souvenir'... From time to time may pick it up and think, wonder what Nino Peralta's doing? Is he still penitent? On your knees? Yes.. Never would have believed that couldn't resist. That it would have been the end, goodbye Lucia and the children. But it's all over. Don't think so. That man will come back. Why?! Hello Nino Peralta! Would you like to drink something? No thanks, it's too early for me. We must talk. - Look after the stall for me Salvatore - OK Besides have some news. Some news that you'll like. Come. Let's take a ride. Here. You drive.. but not too fast, it upsets my stomach. How is your daughter? Better. Getting good treatment? At the moment she's resting for a bit in the countryside. Good. The family is everything. You know I'm sorry was a little hard on you the other day but it's necessary especially with those guys watching you. All simple men who believe in ceremony. Either you knelled for forgives or there was only one other solution. But that's enough, don't want to talk about it any more. You know where we're going? Want to make a surprise visit to Selenunte where they've a tourist village under construction. Want to see if the laborers are working. Leave me there and come back for me at 6 and we'll go to the airport... .. for the arrival of someone important. Suppose you can guess who it is? A certain lawyer who's coming back from Switzerland with his wife? Very good! And if you behave yourself might introduce you one day. Perhaps you've been wondering how you'll pass the time after you leave me in Selenunte? You must go to Palazzo Adrianno where you'll find a friend that we know very well. Get rid of him! When was younger was quite sporty. did Greek & Roman wrestling! That was another time unfortunately. Said to myself why not send Nino Peralta to do this? And what better choice than him? can trust him. Otherwise might think the two of them made a bargain to kill someone else, instead of him, a friend in his place? could never believe that about Peralta! It's comes from my land. Shouldn't drink but like it. - What do you say? - It's good Exceptional! Are you armed? Listen, you have to stop for a moment up ahead. Must have a piss again. What a nuisance! Was always healthy as a young man, now suffer from diabetes. And have a bladder that doesn't work! There's even traces of blood. My doctor says it's OK but don't mind admitting got frightened. How am going to find our friend? Look for a man called Golf redo Valenza. He's hiding at his house. Golf redo Valenza, where does he live? - Straight ahead. - End of the street. - First you said that you wanted seconds, now you have to finish it. - I'm not hungry any more - Look, don't make papa angry. - You didn't eat a thing, don't you feel well? We have to talk. - No don't go, no! - You heard we have to talk, he's a friend! If he's a friend he can stay here with us. Get him a chair! Come on, stay with us. A drink? A drink? - Sit down - Leave him be! - NO! - Rest of you get on with the meal. No! Don't go! If he's a friend he can stay here with us! Antonio! Antonio don't go! No! No! Antonio! Stay at home! What are you going to do with him? You have to forgive him, he's always been unlucky but he's always taken care of us all. You better be careful! God is watching. He'll damn you! Please... Go! Enough! OK, shoot me here so that's it's over at once. You deserve it for that poor old man you murdered. And I'd do it again, to save my kids from starving! The same way you're doing! Murdering me on the order of the people who gave you your stand back! That's not true. - I'm only doing it because of my.. - know! You're doing it cos you don't want to lose what they gave back to you. It's fair! Friendship, huh! Come on! Shoot me! Go on! Kill me straight away! You can't go on torturing me! Arsenal! No! No!.. No don't kill me! Don't kill me please! - Stop! - Don't kill me! Don't kill me! No! How much do you want? How much do you want? A million? Ten million? I'll rob a bank! Just don't kill me! - Stop it! On your feet! - Don't kill me! - Calm down, calm down! - Don't kill me! Get over there! won't kill you. won't kill you. - Won't shoot you. - Don't.. kill... me... Don't kill me! Come here! Open the trunk. Open it! It's not a place of sacrament you're looking at, it's only Vincenzo Fabbricante! You've.. you've killed Don Vincenzo! How did you do it?! Like this! And if he can order you to kill me then me to kill you then figured that we can bury him together. Don't worry, he won't open his eyes again. He's not coming out of there! Now what do we do? I'm taking the car back to Palermo, I'll leave it in a car park, and then go back to my stall. You better disappear! To Milan, Germany, any where. You need any money? But if they come and say Vincenzo Fabbricante has disappeared do you know anything Nino Peralta? What do you reply? I'll say I'm at their service, ready to do anything, even if don't know nothing. Because for me Don Vincenzo Fabbricante was a benefactor he gave me everything have. Respect him like my father, even more! Have a drink, the wine was his. - Why did you kill him? - You don't understand? Because in return for giving back what was mine, he took everything! Everything? Like what? He took away my life. only lived on his permission. And he began giving orders! And that's something a man can't accept. And didn't kill you because didn't want to obey his orders! You understand that? Drink! Here's my wallet, take whatever you need. Then you must go at once. Understand? At once. When they start searching for Don Vincenzo Fabbricante, you'll have to be gone. Where will go? Don't know. The further you go the safer you are. Well then, maybe should take some more? Take it, take it. That's what's left of the two million. Thanks Nino. And what are you going to do? You really going back? Yes.To serve soft drinks and coffee like before. You see, wish could have been like you are. You're great Nino! You fucked them all in the ass! And when they start to look for Vincenzo Fabbricante. Where is Vincenzo Fabbricante?! - Vanished! - Out of sight. Finally it was his turn to pay for the others. You're great Nino! What happens... what happens if you hear from Raul Marini? If he calls me then we'll talk and I'll tell him what told the others. Of course but if he starts to give you orders? I'll wait for that moment... .. and worry about it then. You just worry about where you're going! Yes, yes, of course. Now I'll go home, pack my bags and get ready! And you'll fuck everyone including the lawyer for sure! Heh.. sure.. - See you later - Bye Give me some tokens! Come on, I'm in a hurry. That's enough.. that's enough... Here... now... - Hello - Hello, who's speaking? A person.. a person who has always done his duty at Vincenzo Fabbricante's house. Yes, but who's speaking? Listen, something awful has happened! A crime has been committed. A horrible crime, only... didn't do it, I'm innocent! I'll reveal who.. Hello?! What crime do you mean? We must keep our heads in place. Who were you talking to? Tell me what you said. Was it about Fabbricante? - No. - Yes but what do you think you'll get out of it? They've already sentenced you to death, did you think they'd pardon you? - We'll be caught you'll see! - Who'll catch us? - Nobody will catch us we'll just use our heads! - We'll be caught! You're kidding yourself! You'll see... know them.. know them! But don't you understand that nobody knows anything? Come on sit down, have a cigarette. Go on! Here. What sort of arsehole are you to give yourself away? Spare you and you do this. Thought about your family, did you think about mine?! What should have done then? Murder you instead of him?! Hope you realise that if can't trust you... .. you feel better. You understand? Let's go to your house. We can rest and have something to eat. Let's go. NO! Because I'm innocent! It was you who killed him! I'm innocent! - I'm innocent! - Stop! - Platamonte always follows orders! - Stop! - He never argues! - Don't force me to do it! Listen to me! Don't force me to do it! I've only been loyal, I'm not a traitor! Shut up! You're right.. you're right Nino! You're right, let's go back home, let's go back home. Help me up. Can't see any more! What did you say? Can't see! My hands... I'm... didn't want to do it. didn't want to do it! DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT! Special thanks to Salvo La Rosa.
