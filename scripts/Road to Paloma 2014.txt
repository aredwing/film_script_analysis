Said they were federal agents. The only Bob I know is you. Why don't you shut up and listen? This case has been floundering for six months. You dropped the ball. I'm sending Williams. Williams is a robot. Nobody likes him. Yeah, he's gonna hold your hand. Just stay put. Don't have an original thought. - Hey, Al. - Hey, Joe. You look like shit. So what do you got? Our perp is Robert Wolf. He's a native from the Mojave reservation. He comes off the reservation and kills this Charles... - Grigsby. - That's right. With a rock. Schaeffer is too close to this. He can't see the forest for the trees. That's why I need you to go down there and take care of this. I can smell you from here, son. Thanks, Pops. Make yourself useful and bring over a piece of that dacite. - What are you making? - Same old, same old. Making blades. Yeah? Let me see. Here you go. So where you been? Up in the Sierras mostly. How you taking care of yourself? Find a couple odd jobs. Helps me get by. You know, you look like shit, boy. Yeah, feel like shit, Dad. Well, go in and get yourself cleaned up. Go get yourself something to eat. Yeah. Have the feds been here? Not since the funeral. How was the ceremony? Good. She was loved by many. Have you seen your sister? No. I haven't seen her or Irish. I told you what would happen. Yes, you did. And we tried it your way and look where it got us. And look at what your actions got you. I couldn't let him walk free. You're not the law. No, I'm not. But when justice isn't served, then what, Dad? And your justice, what has it given you? When they catch you, it'll be life. I'm here for Mom's ashes. I want to take her back to where her life began. I want to take her so she can start her journey. That's why I'm here. Her ashes are with your sister. Son, come with me to honor her. Yeah. Well, first up, I guess, in turning over six months of my hard work, take you up here to the site of the murder. Take you through it as best I can. Here it is on the left. 1402 Shithole Street. This is where it all went down. Well, this is where is happened. Chuck Grigsby's last stand. He lived in this palace here. Wolf got all done up in the war paint. Found red and black everywhere. That's the Mojave's colors. Then Wolf had that dacite club knife thing that he'd made. Beat the scalp right off of him there in the house. Charlie goes boogeying through here, blood all in his face. Wolf caught up to him, beat every bone in that guy's body from his toes to his sternum. Turned the guy into a maraca. What a fucking way to go. Too good for him. Piece of shit deserved it. Anyway, he... Hello? Son of a bitch. Standing around like a fucking idiot talking to myself. Whiskey Whiskey fucking me over Thank God it's all in my head Always got me backwards I can't take some more blow Goddamn whiskey Goddamn whiskey and blow. - Fuck you, man! - Out of the road, punk! Whatever. God damn it. Ahem. Is that your bike? It's a nice bike. You're bleeding. Yeah. I was teaching someone how to fight. You should probably go get that looked at. Nah. You know how to play that thing or you just carry it around for show? It's for show. Come on down here and have a drink with me. Hey, here. Hold this, brother. Help yourself. They say if you drink enough bourbon, you'll have a time travel. Excuse me? You go into the... ...the future. I used to be in a band, but not anymore. I'm sorry, what? I play music, too. Here. Oh, thanks, man. You got someone you can call, get you home? Mm-hmm. Mmm. Ah, the future. Morning, sunshine. How's the head? What happened? What'd I do? I'm sorry. Will you help me find my bike? Yeah. Thanks. So, Bob. When's the last time you saw old Robert Wolf? I told you before, I don't know him. Yeah, well, I brought you a picture this time to help with your memory. You seen him now? I don't know him, so I ain't seen him. Uh-uh-uh. Don't touch the fucking car, man. Got to tell your dog to stop snooping around in my garage. I will, Bob. Hey, what happened to the Panhead that was here a couple days ago? I put a new carburetor into it yesterday and the client came and picked it up. Yeah? When was that? Yesterday. What was the client's name? I don't recall. What'd he look like? Don't recall that, either. God damn it, Bob. You're gonna have to start recalling something. I'm a federal agent. Do you want to go back inside? You're on parole. I'll make a call. You can be in there tomorrow with your granddaughter visiting... Let me tell you something. You want to arrest me, do it.

That's why I ride this piece-of-shit Yamaha. She looks like shit and she sounds like shit, but the faithful bitch won't die. Yeah, well, it's not about the bike, you know? It's about getting on the road and being free. Yeah. It's better than the wind. What's her name? Dirty Fucking Whore, after my ex-wife. So, where you headed? South. I'm gonna go see some family. Oh, mind if I join you? Sure.

Well, I'm a little short, so you're gonna have to get this one. Christ, Wolf. I don't have any money for this. What? - Let's get the hell out of here. - Dude, we can't walk out. You guys don't have any money, do you? You mean American money? That's really cute. I'm gonna call the police. How about that, okay? Listen, hey, I', s... we can work something out, okay? Please? Dude, I didn't follow you to do charity work. I didn't ask you to follow me. I got to make money. And not the fucking hard way. Hey, whoa, whoa. Whoa, excuse me. Where you going? I'm going to take a piss, Todd. You got an itch to hold it? You know what? I gave you a break and let you try to work off your debt. Shut up. I don't need to be disrespected by either one of you guys. Hey, man, he's not my buddy, okay? I'm sorry. I'm gonna do the dishes. I'm almost done, okay? I apologize. He's an asshole. Just finish up and please don't come back here anymore. Hey, sorry, man. That guy's a fucking asshole. You want to make some quick money? Fuck, yeah. There ain't no use for the slow man He's a drunk and he is cruel, but he's a cold man He'll paint your noose like an omen He's got you thinking about your death and you are frightened Ain't no use for the slow man He's a drunk and he is cruel, but he's a cold man He'll paint your noose like an omen He's got you thinking about your death and you are frightened... You can't refuse what the old man Whispered to the preacher during the sermon He's a saint to the fools of the old land But we can see straight through the tricks that he is turning He'll speak but you got to believe There's only trouble creeping through those teeth... You got big fucking balls showing up here. That information I gave you cost me some business. Tribal cops knocking on my door. You know that wasn't my intent. What just happened? It's payday. Like to fight? Let's make some money off of it. God damn, you're a big Indian. Come on. Shit. He fucking won. Give me my money, brother. Better get out of town, white boy. - Thank you. - Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. Well, hell's bells What you trying to sell? Put it on the table before they take you to jail What do you say? Got a bottle to your head And you never saw it coming And your pretty white shirt is red Well, I guess that's what you get When you were leaning on me, I heard you asking for it Did you not come here looking for a fight? They say brown liquor make you sleep all right Cocaine make you grind your teeth all night... Run in here and get some smokes. You want anything? No, I'm good. Hey, Mr. Kemp. How you doing? I need some Marlboro Reds, please. I knew it. - What do you want? - That him? Oh, yeah. Hey, Numay. Hold up a sec. Numay's Mojave for mountain lion. You know, it means "don't fuck with me." How you doing? Numay, good to see you. - This is... - Agent Williams, "Numy." It's Numay. - I heard you were in town. - Did you, now? It seems any time a rape occurs on the reservation, you guys are nowhere to be found. But a white man's murdered and it's call out the cavalry. You know, he's... he's got a point there. Look, we're getting off on the wrong foot here, Numay. We just want to find Wolf. We want to keep him safe. You know where he's at? No. We're getting calls every five minutes. I know he's in town. You know he and I don't see eye to eye. Yeah. Well, I guess that doesn't surprise me seeing as you're a lawman and he's a wanted fugitive. Mr. Williams, my wife was raped and beaten in our home. I abided by the law. I arrested him. And you see where that got me. Well, I deeply sympathize with your family's loss, but you can't go around taking the law into your own hands, now, can you? So why don't you and I stop wasting each other's time and you tell me where he's going? Unfortunately, glory cases are not my department. - That a '56? - '55. Looks good. Better when she runs. What's wrong with her? Radiator's shot. I can help. I can handle it. Oh, fuck. Still want to help? Come on, is that all you got? Almost. - Thanks, Bob. - Nice to meet you, Cash. Good luck. Thank you. - We did it. - You did it. - Wolf. - Wolf. I like that, Wolf. Um, Magdalena. Magdalena. Um... so I have another favor to ask you. What? I live about a mile down the road. I could obviously use a ride. - Would you? - Love to. Great. I'll grab my stuff. You know how hard it is to sell a house in today's market? - Hard. - Very hard. Especially when it's been trashed. This is why we're not together anymore, Cash. You sabotage everything. Seriously, you're like a child. I've got potential buyers standing there with me and I look like an asshole. Now, would you rather file for bankruptcy? Because that's the only option you're leaving me with. Just sell the fucking house, Linda. Can't believe it. Fill my lungs with something sweet Fill my veins with something that stings Come over here, baby And give me some loving To ease this pain... Oh, your own place. - This is it. - It's cute. Yeah. - I'm freezing. - I bet you are. Can I get you anything? I am good. I can head back and fix your car for you. Thank you. - It's beautiful. - Yeah. It's home. So, where you riding to next? Up north country. Oh, yeah? What's up there? There's this lake. I want to spread my mom's ashes there. She passed a couple months ago. I'm sorry. Smell. It's pretty- Yeah. It's beautiful. So what about you? What about me? I don't think I've smiled this much in a long time. My face hurts. Sorry. What are we gonna do with these? What shall we do with those? What are you gonna make me?

Well, thank you, Cash. Well, thank you. That'll be $100. $100? For what? The dances. Well, I don't have $100, sweetheart. It's Layla. Whatever. Really? Bobo! Relax. Okay. What about the money I spent here? I got money in this place. Fuck you! - Get out of here. - All right, guys. See you later. - Hey. - Thought you left me. I fixed her. I think. Try her out. We'll see about that. Hey! Ta-da! You said we'd move back East If the well ran dry Make a new home in New England On the state line Under the pine trees and rubber leaves I thought we'd never run out Heavy as sin in the strong winds south Heavy as sin In the strong winds south Heavy as sin In the strong winds south. Can I see you? What are you hiding under there? Nothing. Scared? I am. Don't cut me. All right. - Ow! - Oh, God! - Sorry. - Damn it. You thought that was funny, huh?

Get out of there. - Shit, be easy on me. - Oh, God damn, you're heavy. Fucking Christ. That hurt? You all right? No. No, I'm not all right. I figured out some shit last night, though. When anyone tries to love me... I push them away, make them hate me. I also figured out I might have a drinking problem. Maybe. Then I was thinking, man... I don't really like myself, man. You know? Fuck. Come on. Where's he at? He's out back. Guard that with your life. Step outside. Shh. You know who I am? Mm-hmm. Do you know why I'm here? I'm looking for a great big Mojave going by the name of Robert Wolf. He came by here yesterday. What did he want? Money. And? Came by with a white guy. Was it Irish? No, some other white guy. Irish doesn't live here anymore. Good. Now, which way did he go? I don't know. You don't know? And you know where Irish lives, don't you? Don't know. You know what? I believe you. Who's Irish? Um, you know, Irish. He's Timmy Murphy. You know, married to Wolf's sister. They used to run together. It's in the report. - It's in the report? - Yeah. Yeah, I think. Maybe not. I don't know. Irish is Timmy Murphy. There. Well, I'd like to meet him. Yeah, well, you can't. He's 500 miles away. They're up north now. They're out of the picture. We got people on it, but there's no way Wolf's going over there for dinner. Guy's wanted for murder and he's not an idiot. Get in the fucking car and take me to Irish. Damn. You are fun. Okay, we'll do that. Zip on over there. Take my arm Sinking low But in public I am bleeding on a pole Who is this? Another friend? Don't introduce me, I got enough on my hands But I am not the other guy You better strike while the iron's hot or say good-bye I do All I can I can For you Once you're done You'll spit me out Or chew.

Stop right there. Now turn around. What are your names? Cash Guirgis. Robert Wolf. Now, what happened? We're coming up the road there on our motorcycles and we saw the boy on the side of the road. He had blood on his shirt. He has blood on his face. We stopped. We followed him down to the ravine about half a mile back. - Down there there's a white guy. - Stop right there. - We were just trying to help. - Shut your mouth. This is Officer Sosi. I have two suspects at gunpoint at the ranger 103. - Send help now. - No, we're just trying to help. Shut your mouth! Are you armed? No, sir. Are you armed? No. The both of you turn around for me. Robert Wolf? Are you Numay's son? Yeah. This is Officer Sosi. I have one white male suspect down by the river entrance. Send help now. They're coming. You guys need to go quick. Thank you. Let's go. They're coming. Get out of here. Why the hell are we running? You got something you want to tell me? Look, Wolf, just be straight with me, man. That's all I'm asking. My mom was raped. When my father found her in our house... she was beaten so badly, he couldn't even recognize her. We had to put her on life support 'cause she couldn't breathe on her own. She couldn't eat. She couldn't speak. She was gone. They catch the guy? Tribal police found him and they arrested him. But because he wasn't native, he's got to be tried in a federal court. Federal prosecutors declined the case because apparently it wasn't serious enough. They hold him for a year and then they release him. Six months ago, I tracked the man down and I killed him. Been on the run ever since. Morning, sunshine. Coffee? It's hot. Sorry I went through your pack. Breakfast? You know you got a snoring problem? - Really? - Yeah, it's disgusting. - Seriously. - Fuck you. Cheers. Thanks, man. So, where we going? This place is amazing. Something I can help you with? Yeah, you sure can. How much for this? All this stuff. All these knickknacks and whatnot. I'd like to buy it, your place. It's not for sale, my man. Well, I was hoping maybe we could work out an arrangement. Get the fuck off my property. Ooh, tough guy!!- I fucking knew it! You got seven seconds to get off my property, motherfucker. Fuck! Who is that? That's Cash. Irish, Cash. - How you doing? - You motherfucker. I almost fucking tuned you up, man. God damn it. You want a beer for that? Oh, I'd love a beer. I would, too. When do you not? I got something I got to show you. Come with me. Come here. Come, come. Wolf, meet Wolf. This is your godson. Good job. Where is she? Oh! Let's go get that drink. - He has Mom's spirit. - Really? - Mmm. - He looks beautiful. Thank God he looks like you. I miss this. Can you stay? I wish I could, but I can't. You know I can't. You seen Dad? - You talk to him? - No, no. You know, not... Not since the funeral, no. I want to take Mom's ashes. I want to take her to the lake. She would have wanted it that way. Yeah. I think... yeah. - I think she'd... - Hey. - She wanted that. - Yeah, she did. But, you know, I also... kind of wanted to spread her ashes around here 'cause I want Wolf to know that she was around. I just think so. - I just want to take some. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - We're just gonna share, okay? - Yeah, we'll share. I'm not sorry for what I did. Not at all. I'm sorry for what I've lost. Cash, I sold the house. I sold the house first thing this morning. Wow, that's... I mean, it wasn't our asking price, but it's not bad considering the market. Cash? Yeah, yeah, I'm here. So where are you? Um, I'm with a friend. So... so that's it, then. I guess we're done. Take care of yourself, Cash. I mean that. Yeah. You, too. So lay low Baby I won't be back any time soon If it gets too lonely I will follow you around in this tune... No, that's we. We. I don't know what to do What I'd do if I knew We go through our day And get by and get through But my heart is with you You probably knew Your love is like glue So lay low Baby I won't be back any time soon. Fuck, I've missed you, man. God damn it. Wasn't sure I was gonna see you again. You know something, Wolf? I'd have done the same fucking thing you did. I just wanted you to know that. You're a good man. I love you. All right, you ready? Come on, man, I'll take you up to the lake. What's wrong, baby? Irish. Welcome home. Who the fuck are you? Agent Williams, FBI. Sweetie, can you take Wolf upstairs, please? Wolf? Touching. After your brother the murderer? One Robert J. Wolf. Where is he? Listen here, you son of a bitch. I know my rights. So unless you got a goddamn warrant, you get the fuck off my property. A goddamn warrant. You know, I don't like this any more than you. But we're here because your brother brought us here to your house and your son. You know, you're a very lucky man, Irish. Now, tell me where he is. Agent Williams, I'd like to help you out, but the truth is we haven't seen him in years, right? So you can go fuck yourself. That was a federal offense. Now you listen to me, you fuck. I'm gonna tear your family apart. You want to harbor a fugitive, you're federally fucked for life. And you, Eva, you're an accomplice. Two years minimum. Child services aren't what they used to be.
