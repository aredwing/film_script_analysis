I want to make a deal. That's why I am coming. Sit. Tell me. Raje-bhai, you know the present state of Bollywood. No film is making money. Even the flop hero demands crore rupees! You tell me sir, if these stars demand so much. How will poor producers like us survive? Yes? Why don't you take me as your hero, Mr. Kuku? What are you saying? - I wasn't joking. I.. I wasn't laughing.. sir. It's a good idea, sir. We could plan something for the future. But for this project.. We had Saif Ali Khan and Aishwarya Rai in mind, so.. Aw, come off it, man! You go begging to the same old stars. ..but you won't give a real artiste a chance. Sir, there is less risk with stars.. Risk? - Risk! If this goes off, is it less risk? What are you doing sir, please! Don't worry, Kuku, I'm not Going to kill you.. Even I want to stay in the industry. - Huh!? Come here, Mr. Kuku! - Huh? - Come here! As I seem to you; I am not like that. I might look like a gangster, but I'm not, I'm an actor! I have done theatre for 15 years, To be or not to be, that is the question.. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer.. The sling and arrows of outrageous fortune.. Neither any tear nor complain! Just one.. just one silence! It doesn't allow anyone to know anything! Did you like it, Kuku sir? Hamlet.. Did you see this, sir? This is the power of the performer. Kuku sir, don't worry, here, have some water. Drink it! Drink it, sir.

And that Manu, you don't know him. Bygones are bygones. VK, the worst is over, you were great. Nobody suspected a thing. The whole day I can't speak.. For the fear that they'll recognise my voice. Nobody will know. You are the best! Who wants to be best, l just want to be alive. Why did you touch her? What are you talking, scoundrel? Come on; move back! Raje-bhai, do something, stop this or I'll have to call the cops. Uncle! Uncle! - Move back! Move back! Take him back. Go and handle it. - Yes I am coming. Thrash him! Thrash this scoundrel!

If you are a doctor; can you say anything? Abbas, catch the scoundrel, don't let him go. I am handling him, boss. - Don't let him go like this. Come on; boss! Let's go! If you say anything about Raje-bhai. I'll kill you on the spot, scoundrel! We shouldn't take anything also. We should demand for a partnership. Abbas, I don't remember anything, right? Then why do you talk to me as if nothing's happened. Because nothing has happened, Raje. Nothing has changed.. You are Raje and will always be Raje. Very good! Now let's do this. Why did you beat me? When did I beat you? When I tore the pillow. - When did you tear the pillow? I asked you first, and in any case it wasn't me. I'm sorry okay? But who tore the pillow? Me! - And I got thrashed So what, he's your brother after all. If uncle Manu does some wrong thing. And you get thrashed for it? Will you like it? Shall I shave my moustache? - What? I was thinking I should shave my moustache. Why? - Just like that! Tell me. As you wish - Do you want me to? Did you ask mother? Why should I ask mother? I'm asking you.. What can I say? I never asked you before? Okay sorry, I'm asking you now. Tell me. - What should I say? I have never seen you without a moustache Think, imagine! See this! Yes? Tell me. Shave it off! Shall I shave it? - Yes! - Okay. Listen! - Yes? Shall I shave it? Will it do? Shut your eyes! What happened? Hi Papa, good morning Papa! - Hi, good morning! What happened?

Did you ask Revati? - Yes. Show me! Papa's shaved off his moustache! Calm down Shetty We've already bumped off Raje-bhai! Now what you have to do? Whether the plan is successful early or late? I killed him on the 1 9th of the last month. Today is the 22nd. One month and three days. Did any newspaper print my picture? Does anyone in our circle know? I've not even celebrated his death properly.. Because of you.. Yes speak! Yes I am sending him. Gawde, you party. It was a simple murder plan. You've turned it into a government plan. Now it won't finish in 10 years. Thanks to you! Wait! Hang on Shetty, hang on for a week. Next week, we'll have a party, for the whole family. You'll have a family party? Where the hell is your hero? Raje-bhai.. we're home, Raje-bhai. Come on; come on. Come on kids, get down! Get down from the car. Come on; come on! - Keshav, get down. You get down first.

Let him come in. Hire a strict security. Welcome back home, Raje-bhai. Uncle, me too! Raje-bhai, you tell me. Am I wrong? Think with a cool mind. No, no! The thing which is impossible. What's the use of discussing it? Janki Seth, our relationship goes back a long way. Exactly, brother Abbas! Have I ever made a deal with anyone else? So sign the contract. We'll see later, brother. Now, that is unfair! How is it unfair, We got the land for you? Yes, but I paid for it, didn't l? If the prices have gone up now, that's my good fortune. Why should I share 50% of profit? If I explained it, would you understand? If you were smart, wouldn't you have understood by now? I can also see a few things. Everyone knows to get things done. When it is time of payment; everyone disappears! Why? Aren't we human beings? Don't we live? Don't we have a right to eat? If you steal bread from a worker, you'll never survive. You'll rot in hell. Earn our goodwill, not our curse. Nobody ever thrived on curses, nor will ever will! I do my job properly, right? Don't I do it? You know I work most honorably, diligently. I slog day and night. I work hungry and sleepless! I toil the entire day. Right, Manu? You tell me. Isn't this the truth? What I'm asking from you; it's not my right. I am asking the right of my work. I worship my work and if you steal from my God's right.. it'll be doom's day, a calamity, a Catastrophe! I.. I'll sign it.. Here! - Sign! These signatures? - They are new, the bank knows. Thank you!

It's arousing me. Am I going mad Revati? Even if you are, what's wrong with it? I like this monkey. No, he didn't call. I had told you before. He will deceive us. He won't be able to do it. If he does. Then you handle him there. Fine. Naik is there. If anything goes wrong, we'll kill him. Damn it! - Must you switch on the light? Why, you can't sleep? Yes? Why are you getting so disturbed? Yeah Tipnis! - Yes? Tell Naik to find out where that idiot is. - Yes sir. If you have any problem; then inform me. Okay? - Yes, sir. Very good! - Very good!
