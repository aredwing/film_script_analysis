There is a subculture of people who claim... 24 hours a day working on a computer. And they want to show how smart they are. The cyber thief had removed valuable files. The virus then reproduced itself. The entire planet has access to the Internet. The entire planet has access to your computer system. As telephone technology gets easier... A growing high-tech crime wave. Telephone lines are... With a hacker's treasure trove of files... They range from extortion to industrial espionage to blackmail to just malicious behavior. There are other hackers eager to cause damage. It's getting worse because we're increasingly connected. As the need increases to try criminals through... Cellular telephones and fax machines. The FBI is asking phone companies to prepare for the day when... What point did you first question the ethical propriety of what you were doing? Once the FBI knocked at my door. What's up, baby? What's going on? Sorry I'm late. I'm Lance. I'm Alex. This is Kevin. Mitnick. What's going on? So, I heard a lot about you boys, especially you, Kev. Oh, yeah? We've heard nothing about you. Yeah. Never heard of the Icebreaker? That's me. No. I'm telling you I'm the shit. Look, we have no doubt. You set this up. What do you want? I thought we should talk because I like to stay current. We like staying informed. I'm not hacking anymore. - And neither are we. - Yeah. Right. I thought we should talk. I like to share information. What do you got? I got DMV access. We got it. I got cellphone tumbling. Your cherry list is tired old hacker bullshit. And so are you. Hey! What do you guys know about SAS? What's that? Haven't heard of it, have you? What is it? A service Southern California Telephone offers the FBI. Can monitor any phone, anytime, anywhere. Would you be interested in that service? Yeah, if it wasn't "Fantasia" bullshit. It's insecure. It's dial-up. It's impossible. I got it, kid. What do you got? To go. We'll be in touch. Give you a call. All right, another possibility would be let it go. You know what I mean? This guy was weird. This whole thing reeks of entrapment. Then there's something to consider, which is we're older, and we got jobs, and you got a wife. We're not just kids anymore. This is where you always get in trouble. This is where you cross the line. We're on probation, for Christ sakes. The FBI's been looking for a reason to nail you. Don't give it to them, man. Just walk away. Why do you have to do this? I just have to know. Joe Fredy. Hi, this is Joe Fredy. Hi, this is Joe Fredy down at the Wilshire office. Hi, I'm Joe Fredy. I just want to steal some stuff. This is Joel. It's Joe Fredy at the Wilshire office. I'm putting together an inventory report, and he wants it yesterday, you know? Bastards always do. Yeah, they sure do. What can I do for you, Joe? I need some info on the SAS system you got there. SAS system? What the hell is that? You got me. I'm reading it off the page here. My guess is it's probably a gray box, maybe sort of the end of the rack, near the bottom? All right. Hold on a second. I'll check. - Got it. - Great, great. Yeah, it was where you guessed, except on the top. Well, nobody's perfect. What's it say on it? "SAS. Switched Access Services. " While you're at it, can you give me the serial number? Oh, yeah, the manufacturer name, too, please. Yeah? Yeah, hi. I'm trying to get in touch with Chris Munsen. This is Joe Fredy at Southern California Telephone. I was told you were the engineer who designed the SAS system. Yeah, I'm him. I was sorry Netcorp went out of business. You guys produced good product. Yeah, we thought so, too. Till the company got liquidated. Me and 200 other people found ourselves out on the street and out of luck. Aw, man, that sucks. Anyway, I just wanted to compliment you on your SAS work. Really? Yeah. It's pretty good, isn't it? Good? It's beautiful. It's obvious you know your stuff. I'd love to pick your brain about the design and application. Yeah. No problem. Sure. Well, how about this? I've got all the designs and info on my hard drive. Let me fax it to you. And then I can answer any question you got. Hell, I'll send you a copy on floppy. - How does that sound? - That'd be good. Western Electric. Statement balance. Constant rate. This is pretty damn amazing, Alex. FBI, L. A. P. D. , Justice Department. You can listen to how agents get their information. Their names, badge numbers. Who works what, who reports to whom. You could play Big Brother, beat them at their own game. Hey, Shelley. Alex. - Hey, baby. - Hey. So, what's next, dude? Mike Leahy. Tony Green in corporate. How are you? Just fine, Tony. Yourself? I'm doing okay. I'm in a bit of a pickle right now. I promised my boss I'd have the phone numbers for the SAS, but I got wrapped up in meetings. - You know the drill. - Do I ever. Listen, I need a favor. I need to get those right away. Don't sweat it. I'll fax it right up. Even better. I'm gonna have someone pick them up. - You sure? - It's that important. I'll get them ready. Mike, how are you? Joe Turner. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude. But do you work for Southern California Telephone? No, no, I'm in sales at Calcom. Just trying to close a deal with Tony's office. Do you know what this is? Look, Mike, I'm just doing Tony a favor. I was heading to corporate. He asked me to pick up a package. That's all I know. Just have Tony send it back through intercompany mail. Will do. Hi, Jane. Jane, would you stick that in the mail? I'm late for a meeting. Send it to Mike Leahy. I owe you one. Don't talk to your boyfriend. I'm not talking to... Can you hold on a second? I don't know who that was. Hey, boys. Glad you called. We brought some toys. Yeah? Great. Love it. Thanks. We scanned the place. It's clean. Great. Yeah. Of course it is. Hey, I got the need to pee. I'll be right back. What a nice guy. Yeah, what a tremendously nice guy. And really current. He's the shit. He's completely the shit. Icebreaker is the shit. Oh, all right. Got a present for you. Nice. Let's see it. I think you'll like this. It's Christmas day. Let's see it. All right. Whoo! Where the fuck did you get this? Where did you get this? When you have something for us, we'll have something for you. We gots to go. Oh, shit. You told them about SAS? How could you be so stupid? The plan was I start a dialogue! I did what I had to do. You told me you could deliver Mitnick, but instead, you tell him about SAS? You know what that means? Mitnick will now do anything he can to get that system, which means we have to shut the system down! He's already got it. The system. Lance. I did my best. Lance! Where are you calling me from? What? Where are you calling me from? My house, why? If you're Mitnick and Lowe, what would be the first phone number that you would activate with the SAS system? Might it not be yours? Uh... Shit. Oh, man, that is awesome. That is awesome. Oh, dude. They're pissed at you. They're gonna come looking for you. My probation's up in three days. Yeah, they're gonna come in 3 days, minus 2 seconds. I know. Damn it! Good morning, Osiris. What time is your flight to Washington? Good morning. 10:00. - Want me to drive you? - No. You want some coffee? Why don't you just stay here and sleep in? Like I ever sleep in. Listen to this. "Combining technical wizardry with the guile of a grifter, Kevin Mitnick is a computer programmer run amok, and officials cannot seem to catch up with him. " "Now one of the most-wanted criminals, Mr. Mitnick is suspected of stealing from leading cellular telephone manufacturers, coaxing employees into giving him passwords and codes that could be used to break into their computers. " "While he's thought to be in California, Mr. Mitnick... " Mister. I just can't get over that. "Has eluded an FBI manhunt for more than a year and a half. Last year, he managed to gain control of a phone system that allowed him to wiretap the FBI agents searching for him. " Kevin's on the front page. He's a star. Yeah. He's a marked man, that's what he is. And he's got John Markoff to thank. Why do they use that ugly picture? He looks like a hit man or something. You want a more flattering picture? Why do you care? This is great. What? It's Kevin. Really? He's back. Did you read this? Yeah. It's bullshit. Yeah, but Washington wants an arrest now. The article says there's no proof it's Mitnick. It's just this reporter hyping a story. Mitch, it's the perception that we're helpless against these hackers. I just spent an hour getting reamed by the director and the Attorney General, no less, for that perception. You want me to arrest him for violating probation? I don't know. It's up to you. McCoy, I got real cases with real victims. Mitch, Mitch, find Kevin Mitnick, arrest Kevin Mitnick, then it's over. Aren't you taking this shit a little far, Kevin? This is kind of creepy. Thanks for coming, Alex. I was worried about you. Were you? Yeah. Yeah, I was. I need a favor. I'm tired. I need a place to crash for a couple weeks. All right. All right. We thank Tsutomu Shimomura for appearing before the committee today. Mr. Shimomura is a computational physicist and one of the leading experts on computer-security technology. He's done consulting work with Fortune 500 corporations, as well as the State Department, Defense Department, and others. He's currently senior fellow at the San Diego Super Computer Center at the University of California. Mr. Shimomura, please proceed with your demonstration. What I have in my hand is a cellphone sold by the Nokitel corporation. But really, it's a radio controlled by a small computer. That is, a scanner. Babe, can you make it next weekend? Margaret's still in Spain, right? Come on, sweetheart. I'm needed on the Hill. - I mean, all this talk... - That will be sufficient. Honey, I need to get on top of you. Enough! I want to point out the scanning features were put in by the manufacturer. All I did was discover them. Oh, bullshit. Yeah. Who does he think he's kidding? He's like, "I just found them. " Really. Mr. Chairman, in the future, the public will find itself vulnerable to the prying ears. What he meant to say was "the unsuspecting public. " God, this guy bugs me. Is he even an American? Come on, man. It's the same sanctimonious crap. You know what I want? I want that Nokitel code. With that, I stay ahead of the Feds. I can hear them coming, and I'm gone. - Hey, baby. - Hi, honey. - How are you? - I'm good. You have a nice day? Yeah. Hello, Kevin. So, did you go by Tim's? Yes, I did. Did you feed his piranha fish? Yes, I did. Speak to me. Is this Mr. Shimomura? - Who's this? - Right, sorry. This is Bill Rondell at Sun Microsystems. - We met at Comdex. - Uh-huh? Well, we here at Sun Microsystems saw your testimony, and we were pretty impressed. A fine, wonderful piece of reverse engineering. Well, thanks. I'm calling in regards to an advisory posted on sendmail vulnerabilities, and, frankly, I need help trying to fix it. Bill, I have another call. Can you hold on? - So, Bill. It is Bill? - Right. You got it. Bill Rondell at Sun Microsystems? Right. If you could send me... There is no Bill Rondell at Sun Microsystems. If you're gonna con somebody, get your story straight. Is that so hard? How lame are you? Whoa, whoa, man! He said I was lame. He didn't know who you were. He doesn't know it's you. Speak to me. Shimomura, speaking of stories, you still fucking Julia? I believe it's Julia, right? Peter Maddox's old lady? Peter's a friend, right? When you're fucking, does she call Peter's name? I mean, that would be pretty perverse, wouldn't it? Who are you? Someone who cares. That was really productive. Don't start with me, Alex. Look, Kev, that guy's not gonna be easy. It was a crank call. Nothing more. You didn't hear him. Tomu, the thing between me and Peter is over. It's been over. You know that. You're missing the point, Julia. This is a guy who took the time to find out about you. If he's good, he can be looking into everything. I've got to get going. I've got a long night at the clinic. See you later. Bye. You know, they can wait a little while. Don't you dare. Yes? Who is this? Hey, I got a new story for you. It's the story of the nation's top computer-security expert. He gets hacked, and, believe me, I got the story straight. What? Tomu? Come on. You want to tell me what's going on? Good evening, Mr. Shimomura. No way. No fucking way. No fucking way! 35 cents? Fuck. What's up? You won't believe this hack, man. Our brother Tsutomu's deep in toys. I mean, Nokitel's just the tip. Shut up, man, okay? I'm listening. There's a Crown Victoria across the street. Government car. It's been there all morning. They talk to you? No, they're like vultures. They're watching. Fucking Markoff and "The Times" is what this is about. That and SAS. You switched the pair assignments? Day I moved in. They're listening to the neighbors. Hello? Did you hear about Jim's father? The one that coaches Little League? I heard he's only got one testicle. Well, Sam went in for a vasectomy. Died of a blood clot. - Oh, my God. - Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch. Fuckers are good. Fuckers are real good. They're leaving. Do me a favor. Leave the door open. I'll see you later, okay? I get paid to stay one step ahead of hackers. It's my job to create the cure for the ultimate disease. But the first step is to create that disease. I've done that. And I named it "Contempt. " Contempt breaks down known system defenses. Obliterates them completely. So it's a virus. No. You don't understand. This is not just any attack virus. Contempt understands the Internet links infrastructures, so in a few keystrokes, you could bring a city, maybe a country, to its knees. You could overload phone lines, disrupt air-traffic control, black out a city, scramble software used by banks. And nothing could stop you. And now it's out there. The hacker stole literally thousands of files from Osiris. Research articles, papers, e-mail. I save everything. Take him less time to go through the Manhattan phone book. Odds are, he was after the Nokitel code. That'll keep him busy for a while. You're gonna have to get help. You're gonna have to tell. - What? - Not about Contempt. But Brad and those guys here can help you track this guy. Use them. Use me. Because you were right. You can't stop looking. - Lowe! - What? Could you turn the fucking music down, please? All right! What's your problem? Why don't you ask politely? It's in my fucking house! I could be so rich right now. Right now, I could be on that computer this minute. I could take money from any bank anywhere in the country. I could put it into any account that I want to, and I don't! I don't! And I get that! I'm not John Dillinger. "Warrant was issued. " You scare them. That's all, man. Look, come on, you're reading their e-mail. Sergeant? Let's do this quick and easy. Will somebody check the bedrooms? We're going down, man! We got it! We got it, man! We got it! What's up? Morning, Mr. Lowe. Special Agent Gibson, FBI. Hey. Hey, buddies. Come on. What's going on here? Shit. Come on. What? What the hell's going on here? What the fuck is going on here? That little fucker. Saturday, 8:34 P. M. Mr. Shimomura, I'm the best. My boss is number one. I know sendmail technique. Hey, you! Your Kung Fu no good! You been naughty boy. Don't you know me? Me and my friends will kill you. This is Osiris in my bedroom. This is the machine where I keep the Nokitel code. This is Ariel on my desk in the center here. Osiris can't talk to the world. She only communicates to Ariel. Ariel is the firewall. Ariel, in turn, is connected to the Internet via modem. It was Ariel whose log files began to be subject to deletion. Now, he got to Ariel, which is password protected. But to get to Osiris. Not possible. The 4-minute mile. Not possible. We're talking about a lot of money here. Make it happen. We delay, we lose the deal. I am making it happen. Nobody knows better than me what a delay would mean, and I don't need you to point it out. Last night, I found a piece of code left behind on Osiris by someone interested in finding out if any of the files contain the sequence "I-T-N-I, " as in Mitnick. You think Mitnick did it? - You cracked the Nokitel code? - I got it. Now I need pictures of the Feebs. You know what else is weird? What? The phone call announcing the hack. What about it? Well, why did you even get it? - Gibson. - This is Warren Fox. I'm an investigator at the California Department of Motor Vehicles. I got a call from someone saying he was you. What did he want? He requested photographs of a dozen Bureau agents, including his own. In the perfect hack, the victim doesn't even know, right? Mm-hmm. So, this guy called to gloat? To rub your nose in it? That would imply it's someone you know or someone that you've really pissed off. Try everybody, Julia. I love you, too, Brad. You got a weird way of showing it, boss. This guy's smart. Check this out. The number he gave us was an FBI fax number. But when we were faxing the cover sheet, the fax said he was at a copy center in Culver City. The guy just simply call-forwarded the number. Give me the address of that place, would you? I think that's addressed to me. You're right. It's addressed to "A. Cocksucker. " Oh! Come on. Go, go. Son of a bitch. Fucking Nazi. Fuck! Fuck. Keep going. Fucker. Are you typing? - Are you typing? - I'm not typing. Are you sure? Because that's extremely rude. I would never be rude. It's rude when you're talking to somebody. Can you say where you are? No. You're typing! Will that be window or aisle? What? You know how it is. I travel light. Pourquoi? Are you checking your luggage? The way I look at it, the Internet's a storage facility. - Do us a favor, all right? - Yeah. Just don't get caught. You can't catch what you can't see. You been naughty boy, huh? Don't you know me? Me and my friends will kill you. Are there any questions? Yeah. Would you comment on the speculation that this break-in is the work of Kevin Mitnick? No. No comment on that. Was he after the Nokitel code? That would be a logical assumption. What else they get? That's confidential. Not anymore. Hey, what do you know? I'm sorry. That's confidential. Yeah, not for long. You're looking good, baby. Thank you. Thank you for enlightening us. Whoo! Hey, weren't there supposed to be free doughnuts? Take a deep breath. Step back, Tomu. That's how you're gonna beat him. Mr. Shimomura! Hi. Mitch Gibson, FBI. Got a minute? Okay. Could it be Mitnick? It could be a number of people. I've been trying to get a better grasp of you hackers. I'm a hacker. Mitnick's a cracker. That's a big difference. Look, I've been given a mandate to catch Mitnick. For what crime? Damned if I know. He's a punk and capable of doing damage, but short of violating probation and unlawful flight. - What's your name again? - Mitch. Do you understand any of this? I mean, are you qualified to be handling this? You may look at me and think, "This guy is just stupid. " Huh? "I don't have the time to bother with him. " To your thinking, I am stupid. But my way of thinking is all that matters. To my way of thinking, I'm a guy with intelligence experience, and you're just a desocialized computer geek, not including the pretty girlfriend. Mitch! Mitch, what's up, baby? You remember me? That's Alex Lowe. Close friend of Mitnick's. Hey, Tomu! Number one on super speed! If I was a betting man, he left the message. Your Kung Fu style very good! I think we got off to a bad start here. I know you can help me. Maybe I can help you. Hear me out, okay? Come on, Kevin. Know what I'm saying? My stepfather was radical Jewish Defense League. The bastard was "an eye for an eye, " all that shit. Get this. He used to take Adam and me for target practice. He'd put up these large Hitler posters, and we'd blast... You see this? What? What are you looking at? Where? TAR file. In a directory named "Contempt. " Some of the code is encrypted. What is this? Shit. I don't know. This is like no code I've seen before. Right. What have we got here, Tsutomu? Looks like some worm and virus code all rolled into one. Like some stealth-attack code. But I don't see any government classifications. In fact, there's no propriety designation. There's no CIA, no FBI, no NSA, which is weird. The "G" likes to take credit. I don't think he did it for Big Brother. Come on, that doesn't make any sense. He would do it for himself? Why would he do that? Because he can. Hi. Hi. Thanks for telling me. I didn't know. Hey. Can I get you anything else? Yeah. Another espresso, please. Reading about cyber terrorists? The First Amendment freedom fighters. This is like the Contras and the Sandinistas. It's all a perspective thing. Well, anything anti-Big Brother is good, don't you think? Yeah. I'd have to agree with that. Well, I'll get your espresso. Hey. I think, in the interest of a free and open society, that we should continue this conversation. You're on. I'm Karen, by the way. Yes? This is in Seattle? Right. You confirm the MINs? Jake, give me your number. I'll call you back in an hour. - Tsutomu? - Yeah. Jake Cronin, Cellular One Fraud Division. Whoa. Whew! Man, 15 minutes ago, the sun was out. In half an hour, it will be again. Welcome to Seattle. So, for the past two weeks, I've been tracking a suspect who's been hijacking cellular customers numbers. You know, cloning MINs. Well, their bills are approaching $ 10,000. When I checked the numbers he's been calling, it's mostly modem breath. So he's hacking. So this morning, I went out with a CellScope, cruised the districts, and I got lucky. The CellScope identified a suspect MIN in use. I tracked the call to an apartment on Brooklyn Avenue. What makes you think this guy's my cracker? When I locked on to a call, and recorded it. Check this out. Did you see Tsutomu on the front of "The Times"? - You were front page too. - Yeah, but he's a hero. Me, I'm public enemy number one. - Where's the justice? - The article's a bunch of shit. 20 million computers at risk of being hacked. Like they weren't before. It's pretty obvious that's your guy. Hey. Hey. You wanna go? We ran Brian Merrill and got a T. R. W. But... no library fines, no W-2's, no 1099's. So, it's pretty clear, what we're dealing with here is a legend. After conferring with Mr. Shimomura, we decided to proceed under section 61-A and draw a circle around reason to believe suspect, fugitive Kevin Mitnick. I think the First Amendment is pretty significant. You know, it has value. I couldn't agree with you more. I'm just not sure what, you know... hackers breaking into the DMV... or whatever have to do with the First Amendment. I think the public has a right to know what's going on. With everything, I mean... who you gonna trust? You gonna trust Big Brother? You gonna trust big Corporations? Think they're looking out for you? Think of hacking as a public service. If I knew all hackers were that altruistic, I would. But there's a seriously creepy, voyeur-type thing going on. I mean, looking into someone else's stuff, it's creepy. It's usually not that way. It's usually done in self-defense. - You want ice cream? - Yeah. Yeah? Okay, fan out. Sounds like you admire this guy Mulrick. Mitnick. No, I don't admire him. I don't know... I feel compassion for him. Why's that? Well, he must feel all alone out there. He's being hunted. He's being hunted down like a rabid dog. And, you know, being a fugitive has to change a person. - Hey, Brian? - Mm-hmm? Where are we going? No idea. Race you, though. Hey! They should have waited. Hey. Sorry. It's okay. Do you ever scan? Scan? Scan. Like we were talking earlier. I want to show you how. It's not creepy. Basically, you program this like a computer. Normally, it's programmed to be a phone, but with a little modification, it becomes a scanner. So you scan what? You go up and down frequencies until you find a conversation. You learn things. Lots of things. Brian, I'd rather not. Bear with me. I think you'll like it. If I catch you again, I'm gonna kill you. It was an accident that I ran into him. He saw me and wanted to show me his new car. I am not lying to you! Don't keep lying to me! Fucking mad! Are you threatening me? I'll tear your fucking throat out. Or I'll just smash your head in! Oh, this is great. That wasn't such a good one. No, but I'm sure there are some really good ones. Where you can learn a lot. Listen, I'm gonna have a pop quiz tomorrow, and I have my shift at the coffee shop, so I was just thinking. Maybe I should crash. You know, my mom was a waitress. Really? Yeah. She was a bitch, too. Kevin? We need to talk! What? What'd you want from me? - You stole from me! - What the fuck you want? You know what I want! You've got my files! What else you fucking want from me? - You stole from me! - This guy stole my wallet! - Give him his wallet. - I don't even know him! - He stole my fucking wallet! - Bullshit! I don't have his wallet. - Give him back his wallet. - Get off me! Give him back his wallet. Where am I? Let's just say somewhere less rainy than Seattle. You sound tired. Yeah, well, I am, Alex. I don't know. The whole fucking thing just sucks. Why the hell would Tsutomu be there? Your guess is as good as mine. Yeah, you know what? You're a lot of help. Hey, don't get pissed off at me. I'm on your side, you know? I know, I know. The wolves are knocking, you sound like you could give a shit. What happened with that virus code of Shimomura's? Well, it's really, really dense. I don't know. I know one thing. He cared a lot about it. Most of the source is encrypted. You could put it on the Net and make it community property. Yeah, it crossed my mind. And you could just get the fuck out of the country. If I go, I'm not gonna be able to come back. It might come to that, but I'm gonna crack that code first. You're running out of time, Kevin. I just have to know. Look, Kevin, we both know, man, that Shimomura did work for the NSA, right? So it's safe to assume that the Contempt code is encrypted in 56-bit. There's, like, 37 trillion possible combinations of encryption in that code. With your little computer, it's gonna take you about 100 years or so, give or take a decade, to crack that code. I know that, Alex. But I was thinking of using 10,000 state-funded university computers to crack the code. Ah. Hey, buddy? Good evening, Ray. Don't see computer guys this late during the summer. This is late? I'm usually here when Andy's on. T. A. In a class next semester, and it's got me busy. - I'm sure you know how that is. - Oh, yeah. Have you got your I. D? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry about that. I'm sorry. Oh, just bring it next time. - Yeah? - Yeah. All right. Thanks. Good night, Martin. Mitnick is good. He's better than good, but he's not perfect. He's not a machine. Somewhere, he's made a mistake. I need to find that mistake. We look for patterns by cross-referencing the data from my hack with the Brian Merrill phone records. I'm certain he's using Netcom as his main provider. The log-in times will match one of their client accounts. An account Mitnick has probably hijacked. Mr. Shimomura, the log-in times you sent us did match one of our accounts. The account belongs to G. Kremen, a 52-year-old divorced advertising exec from Minnesota. Perfect. Probably reads e- mail once a month. He's at a telnet session. The other party is somewhere inside Israel. Did you say Israel? Positive. JSZ is somewhere inside Israel. Nokitel. Martin has to be our boy. Any way to trace Martin's P. O. P? I can try. Just keep typing, dipshit. Oh, please. Okay, check it out! In the course of six hours, he's dialed into Hawaii, Boston, Port-of-Spain, Dallas. Man, it's teleportation! Ron, we just need his real P. O. P. Just stay online a little longer. Come on. Come on! Local call. No area code. I got it! P. O. P. 's in Raleigh-Durham! - You sure? - Yes. Your boy's in North Carolina. Mr. Shimomura, Special Agent Gibson has kept me apprised, but this is not about computer security. It's law enforcement. Agent Rollins, I'd like to stay involved. Well, I understand that, sir, but I'm sorry. I cannot authorize civilians going on what has now become criminal apprehension. I will, however, have everyone keep you informed. Thank you. Oh, he's thrilled we're coming. Who are you calling now? Brad. He should have just arrived in Raleigh. I don't know. There's something about this guy. I was on this telnet session, and it was like he was watching me. Listen. Do you know what you're saying? Listen to me. He was there. You're getting jumpy. How could he figure out where you're at? He was there! Alex, listen to me. 9:00 A. M. Tomorrow. Don't forget and don't be late. I'm limited as to what information I can give you. - I'm not authorized. - You said that. Look, Mr. Shimomura, I understand this is important, but I can't give out that info. You promised me you'd help. I want to help, but what you're asking me for, I could lose my job. I traveled over 3,000 miles, and I'm not gonna leave. You heard what he said! He could lose his job. At least show some respect! You're the genius here. Think about what you're doing, man. Man, what's it... Okay, Dan, how about this? We look for the calls to the Netcom P. O. P. Specific times. We match them to the sessions we have. Can we do that? - Can we do that, Dan? - Come on, Dan. All right. I can do that, I guess. It took thinking. Good morning, Rachel. How was your weekend, Mr. Fiori? Short. Way too short. That was fast. Computer Sciences. Tom? Hey, is that you? What you doing answering your phone? Well, I... Who is this? Greg Mundy, B. E. C. Your service rep. Tom, we've had complaints about the latest tape update we sent out. Are you having problems? No, not that I know of. Hold on. Rachel, we having problems with last month's B. E. C. Update? Well, this problem's causing some systems to crash. Jesus. Which is why I'm sending one of my maintenance guys by. His name's Joe. He should be there shortly. I'll just feel more comfortable if he's been by. If there's any problem, he's gonna fix it because we at B. E. C. Like to stand behind our products. Hi. Joe Turner, Binary Equipment Corporation. Okay. Friday. At 15:29, do you see 404-555-7332, duration, 44 minutes? Yes, I have that. Okay. What a way to start a Monday. Okay, Joe, it's all yours. Let me just try a different P. O. P. It's the same day. It's a call to 612-555-6400. It's at 22:22 for 49 minutes. I have it. Rachel, hi. Just in time. Would you do me a favor? Get me a cup of coffee, please? - Sure. - Thank you. Do you see a call Sunday? It's at 02:21, 919-555-8900. Yep. Now, are they all going to the same cell site? As a matter of fact, yes. So, where is it? Well... Cell site 19. It's outside the city near the airport. How big of an area is it? It's a radius not larger than a mile. Hey, Dan. You ever go trolling? - Trolling? - Yeah. Yeah, in the van, just like trolling for albacore. Do you guys like fishing for real because we could go. You're all set. Couldn't find a thing. Hey, thanks, Joe. Lifesaver. Bye, Nancy Drew. Afternoon, folks. I want to officially thank all of you for your invaluable help with this matter. Okay, now that that's out of the way, what I want to tell you is this. We have a delicate situation here. We're trying to build a case against Mitnick. We want the case to hold up. We want the case to hold up even if he hires a Dershowitz or that wiseass Johnnie Cochran. Can you believe this? He wants to take the case, or Jerry Spence shows up, walking all over us because of one single, little, fucking, faggot detail we neglected to take care of. Okay, do I make myself clear? We get warrants for everything, fine. If we don't, we do nothing. There'll be no discussions, just plain old fucking compliance. We gather all the information. We lay down the paper trail. We will apprehend. All right, good day to you. Fucking bullshit, man. Dan, can Brad hang back here and use your phones? Yeah, that's fine. Link up with Ron Bowie at Netcom. Monitor the Kremen account. What are we looking for? Patterns. Our guy's working from a cellular phone like he did in Seattle, which means we can catch him. 10,000 computers at your command? That's like your own computer network. That's awesome. What do you think your exposure is? None. With the system patch, they can't tell I'm logged on. There's no record. That's awesome. How long to crack Contempt? 36, 24 hours, maybe. Awesome! I'm a genius. What do you got? An inexpensive version of your CellScope. It's not very directional, but it'll pick up both channels. How does a private citizen get his hands on that? I designed it. Oh. Makes me a little nervous. Will you read me those minutes, Julia? 555-0106. Next. 555-0120. Next. Got him! Left here! - How's the signal? - Strong. Dan! Shit! Jeez! All right, slow down. We're very close. This may be this complex. Left. Wow, that's close. Pull in here. Pull in here. This building. Definitely this building. Here. Thanks. There's cream and sugar. If he goes outside... We've got him on probation violation. Your people know to halt cellular traffic? Gonna have transmissions scrambled. What do you think he'll do when he hears a scrambled message? You got a point. Well, in an hour or two, Gibson will be in front of Federal Judge Dickson. Despite the fact we don't know which apartment, he'll okay it. And with a warrant, we can make the arrest. It's 3:00, and I'm hoping we will have this wrapped up by 10:00 or 10:30. That'd be nice. I wouldn't drink too much of that coffee. At least we can keep tabs on him. Shit! Modem. I don't like when I hear that. Why? All he needs to do is upload the files, cache them on the Net. Last time he used Netcom. Next time, who knows? He uploads his files, erases his hard drive, and when the feds knock on the door... What? Tomu, what? Knock on the door. Yeah? The knock is the only warning he needs. He uploads his files someplace else. They just disappear, and only he knows where they are. No evidence. That's our window. We can get the files back. We just have to be in position by then. - What are you doing here? - I need a favor. Anybody in Raleigh have a cell-site simulator? - What do you mean, to borrow? - Yeah. I know a guy who knows a guy, but he's not exactly a member of the Better Business Bureau, you know? Look, you did not get this from me. I do not want Kevin Mitnick coming after me. We'll respect your privacy. Privacy? Never heard of it. - Gibson said what? - They got the warrant. - They go at 9:30. - Rollins said 10:00! Then the hell with what Rollins said! Get your ass there. We're running out of time. They ain't gonna make it, man! They ain't gonna make it! Tomu, Tomu, Tomu. So this is what you're chasing. We've narrowed it down to about four apartments on the second floor on this side, and Special Agent Mitch Gibson here will be using the cellular scanner to make the sweep. Once he locks in, we move in. They're on the second floor. Almost there. A couple more seconds. Get Rollins. I think they're there. This is gonna be good. Here comes Rollins. Okay. Who's there? FBI! Open up! Let's go, Mitnick! Oh, Christ. Yeah. Time to share your dirty tool, Tsutomu. The world has a right to know. Aprs moi... ... the deluge. 1, 2, 3. Fuck. Can I help you? Whoa! Hey! Hey! You're under arrest. In Raleigh, North Carolina, the world's most-wanted computer hacker... Suspect Kevin Mitnick was arrested early Wednesday at an apartment in Raleigh. Led the FBI on a chase over two years... Mitnick was tracked down by computer-security expert Tsutomu Shimomura... Kevin Mitnick is accused of cybertheft of information worth more than a million dollars... And at the time of his arrest, the FBI's most-wanted computer criminal. Kevin Mitnick has become a symbol of the insecurities of the information age. Kevin, thanks for letting me visit. I just wanted to get a chance to meet you. Sorry it had to be like this. What happened to my... The files. What happened to them? I had a cellphone simulator in my car outside your apartment. When you thought you were talking to Netcom, you were talking to me. I took the upload. You were the machine. Yes, I was. Kevin, why do you do it? The question's "how?" The question's always "how?" Let me ask you a question. Okay. Why am I in here and you're not? No answer? Why am I in here and you're not? What did I do that was bad? What did you do that was good? I cracked that code. What I did was wrong, and I know that now. And all that research, I destroyed it. That's very touching. Glad you can sleep. Do you want to know why you're in here, Kevin? I got this in the mail. It's a bill from a company that specializes in bondage for $29, 450. You're no victim. I didn't do that. But I know who did. Yeah, it's just a game to you. Yeah, sometimes. Prey on people, take advantage? Since when did you respect anyone? Guard. Guard! Oh, that's right. You walk away. You go home, motherfucker! You motherfucker! Now it's finally over. You glad you went? Glad? No. He's in there because of me. That can't be. I just deposited a check. This stupid machine just ate my card.
