That's nice. What are you saying? I can't hear what you're saying. You want to see who I am? Do you want to? This is what I look like. I'm not dangerous. Even if there's a lot of weird stuff around here. I'm just a regular family man. Ok? I'm just going to get undressed and we'll see how things work out! Don't make so much fuss. I've had enough noise fortoday. Stop wriggling around. You'll just get tired. Let's start with you. - Over here? - We've been everywhere. - We don't have more places to look. - You can't think of anywhere else? Nowhere else? Well... There's one place I really don't feel like going to. There's a guy... His name is Tom. He's a weirdo. He's been living alone in the woods for 20 years. - Which Tom? - Can I explain later? I'll give you an answer later. But I want you to go in there, I can't handle it. - Is that ok? - Yeah. I'm not afraid of any Tom. Alright. That's the last spot and he knows just about everything. Let's see what we find out. - Be careful over here! - Yeah, I'll be careful. Hello! Anybody home? Tom? Hello? What the hell are you doing here? Well... have you seen my sister? She's somewhere around here, we can't find her. We've been looking all day. Mom said you knew where she was. Or that you maybe knew. You know what goes on around here. I have a picture of her on my phone. That's my sister Kimsy. Don't know for sure. Maybe. Perhaps. - You don't know? - No. You can come in and take a look. - You don't want to take a look? - Don't think so. No. - You don't want to? Come on! - No! Come on! Let's go in and see, can't we? What the hell! - Come here! - What the hell! Come overhere! What are you doing? Let go of my daughter! You already fucked me! You're these kids' father. Now you fondle them! - Go away bitch! - You bastard! - Let her go, you bastard! - Fuck off! - Goddam bitch. - Come on, let's go! Bitch! Bitches everywhere! We're safe. Come on, let's go! Get in the car. Go away! - What did you mean he was my father? - It's something I've kept from you. I'll give you a quick explanation. Tom and I were partners many years ago. The result was you and Kimsy. Is that perverted old pig our father? Yes. He is violent and he can't handle either me or any of you. I'll explain properly later. Let's leave it forthe time being. The most important thing is to find Kimsy. I think we should hurry. So, it's the two of us... You'll be a nice girl? You sure? You want to be my dog? Now you're going to do as I say: Just bark, don't talk! Can you bark? Woof? Yeah, that's right. I'll take you into the house soon but first I have to be sure... - that you do as I say. Do you understand? Just rememberto bark. No silly games. Let me get undressed. Let's see if you obey. We're just going to enjoy ourselves. Right? That's it. We'll just do it like this! That's right! That's it! That's a good dog. Yeah, that's it That's the dog I want. Yeah! Oh. Good time. Yeah! "Yeah, oh, yeah. Oh, my god this is good!" Ho, ho! You were good. That's how I want you to be all the time. What? Ok? Hell of a day. This damn house! No more coffee, no more booze... Hey dog? How was your day? Probably much better than mine. What are you whining about? You have nothing to complain about. What do you want? You're so thin you don't eat anyway. You don't need food orwhat? - Woof... - Woof? You! What are you whining about, huh? You bitch. - Thirsty. - Are you thirsty? You're a pain. You shouldn't talk. You're supposed to bark. You! Woof! Damn dog! I think I need another dog. You're useless!
