Everything? - Yes, everything. You smoke and booze in my whirlpool. Are you ever in the kitchen. What for? There is our cook and cleaner. Talk to them. - Who? Did I just hear that there is our cleaning woman. You can watch her working instead of taking a fucking bath. While you get fat and fatter she is working. I pay for her as well as this water. I'm so sick of it. That's enough. I give you 3 month. - What for? I'll explain it to you. If you don't manage somehow to make me horny again I throw you out. When I go to bed I want pleasure. So, it's my fault? - Yes. Listen, you aren't perfect either. I don't have to be since I've the money. Simple as that. And body isn't all. There is something like soul. You know what I mean. - Fuck you. You can leave. Right now. Take your brat with you. You want to take all this? And this stuff too? I guess this time it's final. Yes. I'll miss you, Klaus! Cut the crap! You'll miss the villa, the computer and the DVDs. From now on, you call me Doctor Peters again, ok? The rest gets picked up later. - Nada later, understood? Hold on. Here. Happy birthday, Michael. Next time make yourself clear. I'm not your drudge. Try a relocation company not me. What did you say, my friend? - You heard me. And I'm not your friend. - Is that so? Yes, that's so. - Then stop right here. Okay. Did Klaus give you money? I'm a bit tight. You get it back. Thanks. Taxi! Almost like the villa. The view isn't bad. We won't stay forever, ok. Now what? Do you take a cleaning job. Don't get naughty! Better pick your room first. Take the larger one if you want. - Nah, you have more stuff. Good morning, everybody. - Morning, Mr. Radtke. Please sit down. I would like to introduce... Yes? Seldom guests! - I quit smoking weed. Super! Congrats! So, new pupil, Michael Polischka, comes from Zehlendorf. - Go back home! Would like to. Nazi suburb. - Any idea at all where it's located? Discussed it later. Sit next to Tina. Don't worry, she won't nip. She looks like, though. Does anybody still remember a term. We started the topic last week. No. - Ok, I see, too many new faces. We start from scratch. What are square numbers? How about Mr. Zehlendorf? Numbers that are multiplied ... - Sap! Nerd! Good. A good example would be ... Once more and you'll be deported, ok. So, square numbers are mutlplied by itself. For instance ... For example: 3 squared 2. How about you get started? You better don't push it, understood! Hey, I'm Christian. Everybody calls me Crille. You're in my class. This is my brother Matze. Uglier than me, different mothers, both dead, tough stuff. Now it's just our old man. - I'm Polischka - Great. A real one? - Sure. My father is truck driver. Truck driver? - He drives a truck, got it? I know but where's the connection? - He drives to Russia, got it? So what? - Russia is the wild east. Every minute a truck is jacked. Bam, bam... I want to pay. Sorry, may I pay for you? But it's for me and my son. - No problem. Ouch, I left my money in my studio. - Are you a photographer? Yes, sometimes. Are you a model? Nope, mother. Susie comes. Susie, how it's going? Watch it, you victim! Those shoes are new! Be cautious with them. - Retard! Hey, what's going on? - Get lost, piss off! Hi motherfucker! Do you think you can avoid us? I heard you're from Zehlendorf? Rich asshole suburb. We are not rich. Petty motherfucker, do you want to defend yourself? He has become a man now. Get this, you petty motherfucker! You want to defend yourself, you sissy fuck? If you have a cheap cell phone, I believe you. Sorry but I don't... Petty motherfucker, you knew we would find you. You knew it, you sissy fuck! Next time you pay 50 Euro forfeit. If I have to look for you I'll fuck your mother. You show up on your own. understood? Take your shoes off. Shoes off! Get going! Retard! - Oh, nice socks. - Yes. Take the shoes. Now you are doing push ups. Push ups! Get down! Push ups! You sissy fuck! Down! - 1! Get out of the way. Everything okay with you? So so. I know those bums, I watched them leaving. I let my father know if you want. He kicks their ass. What's your father? Boxer? Nope, butcher. Butcher is good. It's ok. Do you wear this all the time? That's not funny. - Sorry. Hey, are you imitating Jesus? Erol's gang nabbed me. Could you lend me shoes? What? - Could you lend me shoes? I can't show up at home this way. - Sure, come in. Size? - 42. - Do you have a T-Shirt as well? Fetch a beer! You need one, right Polischka? I do. Beer is good. You really can't take Erol lightly. Did you run into troubles? - Here, keep it. He asked if we ran into troubles with Erol? Not a chance. (Both) We are way to dangerous. (All) Cheers for living on the edge. To down. Heck, it's warm. - Cold tastes crappy. Hits you faster. Stay for some days. Our old man is on the way to Kazakhstan. We spent the food money on beer. Skip school as well. What I'm supposed to tell my mother? Play flat sharing and write a paper about it. Requires obviously to live together. - Never did it at my school. See, you're that old. - I just hit 30. Take it back. Oh mom. Could you lend me money? For the the sleep over at Crille and Matze. I'm a bit tight. Take 10 Euro. Lasts for one day. - Then take 20. Could you leave me your key? - Why? You're gone anyway. - So what? I met a super cute guy. An artist without an apartment. He can stay here meanwhile. - What? Don't make a fuss! - A bum stays in my room? He is not a bum. He's an artist. - That dude shares my mattress? Are you out of your mind? What's up with you? How dare you talk like this? He sleeps in my room. On my mattress. - Bitch! I'm sorry. - Didn't hurt! Better now? What about the money? - Or 5 six packs. Probably also some food. - Are you crazy. Let's take a vote. Who's for beer? Majority. Let's go. Ashkem, could you open the door? I've been waiting for 2 days. You didn't show. Please, brought also stuff along. - Fuck you! You embarass us. - You embarass me. I'm sick of your shit. Hide. One gets children by fucking, stupid. - I love you. Don't embarass us. - You embarass my family. I swear, I ... You retard! What kind of father are you? Ashkem, open up! - No way, you victim, fuck face! Gross. (Loud) You annoy me, too. Ashkem, please open up. I'm coming. Where should we put him? - Bathroom, man. Get the toilet rolls. The balcony with fresh air would be better. He can puke all day here. Who needs fresh air? Cleans your mind. Klaus does it this way. - What? Walks into the forest, pukes then jogs. Isn't fair. Rich people always have the most fun. As if you would jog. Like I said. Does he still do it? - Klaus jogs every weekend. Not jogging, I meant drinking? On weekends? - On weekends? Interesting. What's upstairs? Let's get off. Did you clear out the medicine cabinet? Could sell this stuff as drugs at school, like valium. Not bad. - It was way too easy. Yes, man. - Fuck, man. Show us yours. - I took pictures and stuff. Crap! - This is art. It's a certificate of ownership of the moon. Valuable! I got also a dagger. - He owns it since he's 12. I wasn't even allowed to touch it. - Then it's yours. What did you take? - I got us plastic. Camera! How much should I enter? A million. - Idiot, no ATM spits out that much. Enter maximum. More. Doesn't work. - Enter 9999! Doesn't work either, that's it. - How much? - Do it again. Won't work. There's a limit. - Never seen that much. Don't bust it. I need a short break. Hey! Hi Michael. You're Michael, right? I'm Rainer. - Hi. I just need to take a shower. Don't feel disrupted. Good for your mother to show. - I took some days off. I'll give you some more, motherfucker. The money! Where's the rest? - What? We agreed on 50 Euro. Tell him, Tiger. - Only 50 if you had paid on time. But you didn't. Now you pay interest. What were you thinking? - What, you retard? But I... But I'm out of money. This is stolen anyway. - Bah, stolen, you cute fag. Come closer. - Come! Watch. Same happens to you if you don't bring 50 Euro tomorrow. Now nod and piss off. Nod and piss off! Piss off, you victim! Could you light it. It's simple: Pay or they beat you up until they're bored. Take your pick. Thanks for the advice. You're are true buddy. Hi, baby brother. Want to join? - Nope, I ... I just asked him where you are hiding. Back to class! We'll have a talk afterwards. Well? Having fun together? - What's that supposed to mean? You and your bum. - You and your fancies. We talked about art. Rainer sold a picture today. I thought he depends on social welfare. - See. Today he sold a picture. Did you see his pictures. - Nope, he's shy. A shy artist... What's a picture worth? - What, 100 Euro? This time. The customer seemed very interested. Could turn into a money-spinner. Happens all the time. A few bucks first, then they get famous... Bum! Michael? Hi. Do the dogs belong to you? - I have to walk them for my father. Look out! Do you live here? - Yes but you can't come in. Keep in touch! Crille! Matze! Do you want a pounding? - Sorry. One step further and I rip your skull off. Piss off fast! Hey. Your old man is back. Tell us something new. - Something really new. Fuck! - Catched us flat-fooded. Does it hurt? - Sure. My mother's bum has stolen my money. Do you have anything left? Nope. - How? All gone? - Yes. He's likely gonna sell our playstation. I wish he's dead. No, you don't wish it. I do! If we sell our stolen stuff then everything is allright. So, you mean we sell it to a pawnshop? Pawnshop? I know someone better. - The captain? Then I can't come along. - So what? Here it is! - Are you sure? Were I born here or what? - Look at this crap! Hey, that's not crap. - Sure, yada-yada. They never sold a thing. - Can't make a living. Of cource not but... - Then what? Captain Nemo is the money laundry king. Millions go through this door every year. - This door?! Hello. Where's Captain Nemo? - Downstairs. Come. Hey! - Welcome on board. My best buddy, Polischka. - Sit there. Long time no see. How's your stinking brother doing? Sold for cheap a long time ago. Did he tell you about Matze and this shop? No? Look at the hole over there. This bugger knew I had a gun. This one. Got it from Otto. So you know: Otto is his father and my brother. One day a shoot-out gets off. What the heck! Same second a bullet flies by me. I jumped him but this asshole shot my kneecap. This is how children are... Did your father send you? Did he beat you up again? - No. Show me what you got. Hurry up. Give it to me! From where? - Surrounding area. I give you... 300. this is Sterling silver 925. What the fuck, the expert. That's mighty fine. I know that on my own, you whack head. If it would be Perl silver I would put off 50. Ok, ok. No problem. 300. - 300 is copacetic. What would this be worth? - Hand it over. Knick-knack crap! Look, this is a phone! I got an idea for you: Take it to the eyetie. They are always happy calling home for cheap. You know the way? - You mean Hamal? Sure. Are those genuine? - For sure. Best regards from Captain. There. You can't disturb them right know. - Yeah, right. Hello. Greetings from Captain Nemo. We want to sell a cell phone. Do you really believe we need one? - Actually, it's for Hamal. For Hamal. Great. Even better. What's your name? - Polischka. That's your real name? - Nope, Michael. That's even more fucked up. - I'm Hamal. Doesn't sound italien. - Why italien? Captain Nemo said so. My ass. He doesn't even know his own descent. I'm his friend. - Good for you. Why should I buy your cell phone? - I need money. Ok, wait here. Take a seat. Do you have grandfather? - No clue. And you? Sure. The father of my mother. I haven't seen him for a long time, though. Barut, give him the money. Do you know what I'm wishing for? - Spit it out. Sometimes I wish it's quite. Simply quite in my head. Nobody talks, nobody's there, everybody is gone and I have peace. Nothing but peace. Miriam? Miriam, is that you? Simone? - Where have you been? Here and there. The wheather was so bad here I couldn't bear it. So, where did you go? - Turkey. A few days on Rhodes. Turkey seems to be in these days. I prefer classic places, like Paris. I would love to visit Paris again but Klaus is busy, you know. Really? Last week wasn't a problem for Klaus. We had lots of fun. - Oh. You're the new one. Stay in shape. - Don't worry. Nobody says good bye to me. Good bye. Can I get something for you? - I need a bit more time. I see. Who is it? My name is Gerber. I'm a police officer. Oh, should I drop by later? - It's allright. What do you want? Dr. Peters' mansion has been robbed. Why do you laugh? - Just because. I see. You were living together. What's your relationship to Dr. Peters? A dead one. Do you think I robbed him? No. - Did Klaus send you to terrorize me? Dr. Peters didn't send me. Just casual police work... and you shouldn't talk about terror. - I talk like I want. We're investigating the finger prints in Dr. Peters' house... and need yours for reference purposes. Doesn't take long. All right, come in. And again. Now the other hand, please. Tack. So... one more beautiful than the other. Are we done? I'll come back when your son is present. - Not necessary. He can come to you. Ok, then I write it down for you. There he can get hold of me. - Thanks. Ok, then I pack my stuff. I find my way out. - Bye. Hey. - Hey. Oh, a visitor. Hello, I'm Crille. - I'm Miriam. Always nice to meet friends of Michael. Who's Michael? - What's on your fingers? Police were here. Klaus' place has been robbed. Do they think we did it? Absurd! - How do you get that? Right! Ww... Why? - Because of the finger prints. They need to distinguish ours from the burglars. You have to go the police tommorrow so they don't show up here again. How would it look like getting police visits every day. What's that at your eye? - Ah, soccer, got rough. You're served? - Yes. Nice of you to drop by this fast. Cola, 7up, beer? I'm kidding. I'm going to take your finger prints and you're out of here in no time. Hm, I don't know. Should we try it again? Maybe I'm sweating too much. - Sweat is never a good thing. Look how nicely it goes. Look how beautiful they are? - Yes... Are we set? Yes, we are set. Except you want to confess something? Not today. - Then another time. Take care. Hey, you victim! Are you on vacation again? Your buddy told me you talked to the cops. What did you tell them? It had nothing to do with you. - Everything you do has to do with me. When you take a shit or you're crying in front of your mother or Santa Claus didn't give you a present. Everything has to do with me, got it! And when you talk to the cops it has to do with me even more. Now we go playing. I put the blind on. I bet for 50 Euro I find him within one minute. We're playing "pot banging". I bet 20 against you. Show me your money. Go on. My spoon? - There you go. Where's my sweetheart? Where're you going? Cold, very cold. Cold. - 30 seconds left. Hot. Cold. - Warmer. Cold. You bum. Warmer. - 10 seconds left. Where is he? There he is finally. I'm Hotte, I help out your mother. You look like crap. - Now listen up. I don't know who you are. But I'm sick of people walking in and out! You steal my money and show me your cocks! I'm fed up and now piss off. I'm over 1.90 but I constantly got beat up earlier. Not a chance. We're thinking too much. That's our problem. We have to be fast. Are you right hander? - Yes. Open your hand. Did help me so try it. Make a fist. Do you feel it? The weight. That's power! - Doesn't feel too bad. A punch is 10 times stronger now. This is your mother. Don't mention anything, ok? Catch the leader head on and then - wupp - full force. I swear he tips over like a tree and you've one problem less. Wupp, punch up the bracket! - What's going on? What did you do? Michael? It's no problem... - Shut up. I'm having a bit trouble at school. A bit trouble? - Yes. They caught Cengiz. Then they searched his apartment. Cengiz doesn't know how much ... - How much? They took 4 kilo. Do you want to take it? I'm eating. Should I take it? Cengiz was a good man. What's that? - No worries. That's a bank. A bank? Work for your shit luck. Ok, what's with Cengiz? We dig up another man. - Ok. I'm sorry you got involved. Nonsense. Sorry that I told them but they wanted to smash my kneecap. Matze scrammed. You don't look too good either. Hey girls! They'll dream about us. - Or we about them. I could take on 2. I'm no virgin anymore, you know. - How so? You're sleeping in my bed. Polischka, let's split. Hi peewee. How it's going? Look who's there. Already back on your feet? Petty victim. What are you thinking? I gonna kill you! I kill you, motherfucker! Put your kiddy toy away! What? - Put your kiddy toy away! Hey! - Quite. Nobody touches this boy anymore! Polischka, look at him! Come closer. You'll never touch him again! If he touches you again you tell me, ok? Do you understand? - Yes. You too? Whoever touches him again I'll kill. We fuck you up! You have courage! Is it about a woman? Long time trouble? - Do you know Erol? Who don't know this rat. His own people eschew him. Even his father doesn't want to see him although he's his eldest son. What did he do? - He rips me off. Not good. Not good at all. Like this car. Barut, you're supposed to dig up a Cayenne. But this is a german car, too. - Did I say VW or what? Pull over and get me a fucking Porsche. Are you hungry? - Yes. We go eating. Take off your shoes. This is Polischka. Hello. Do you know each other? - From school. This is my cousin. How was the food? - Good. My grandmother likes you. You have a honest face. And people with honest faces are of great use for me. Thanks. "Thanks, yes" or "thanks, no"? Thanks, I would love to work for you I meant to say. Good. What's my job? Barut will lay it out for you. Good morning, Barut send me. - Don't know him. Come along. Mind your stupid business. What are you waiting for? Aha. - Something wrong? It's short of 40 grams. - What? In Turkey you would be dead. Hey, I'm only kidding. I'm Dirk. Call me Dirk. Now leave. - Where's the money? In your left jacket pocket. You're way too slow. The head master wants Michael Polischka in his office. Polischka, head masters' office. [Calls out all federal presidents.] I'm informal, ok? Do you know Erol Uskudat? - I know an Erol only. He reported you for assault. You supposedly broke his nose. - Not true. He started it. It's me they beat up with a baseball bat first. Any witnesses? - Nope. What now? - Usually Erol is reported. The reversal is new. He provoked me. - It's best you come along and... we write down your testimony. Now? - Otherwise busy? The head master told me you moved from Zehlendorf recently. How so? Better ask my mother. - I already did when taking her prints. So? What did she say? - Nada. Because she doesn't dig you. - Who does she dig? - Rich. Nifty car. - Nifty satchel. Hi, Barut. - Hi, look at this butt. No womes's butt comes even close. Push it. Push it. Go, go, go... Ahh, fuck. Damn it. I felt so certain. - Good gambler have a backup. Go to kiosk. I left something there. Do you know the Cafe Karola? - Weser street opposite Erika. That's your delivery address. "Louisiana" to place? - "Bahrenfeld", man, stay in Germany... where we're in control of the horses. - Weser street? Deliver the envelope, get 1500 Euro. If something is missing, you know what? - Yes, I know. You know it already? - Yes. To win? - Come back. No, to place. Here, spend it on your way, ok? Take care. Hey, hurry up. My time is limited. Did you bring the same stuff as last time? Great stuff. Phat evening. We laughed so much. Yes, I'm glad. The money! And what you're doing precisely? - Haul carpets, fold them, make them lint-free, drag them into a cellar, those things. He pays good and is nice. Sounds terrific. I should meet him. What's his name? Hamal. So an arab. We might pick up a persian carpet for cheap. How does it look? - Good. What, good? - Like I said, good. Are you with a new dude? - Check out the kitchen. So, you visited Klaus? - I'm suprised you're so dumb. Were your friends with you at the burglary? You won't see them anymore, got it? - Not so fast. This is fucked up. I try hard to make it through the day. I bring even money home and what are you doing? What? When I was your age I had other problems, I was pregnant. I don't expect gratitude but respect. So, what's your plan to get us out of here? Who died? He. His mother forbids him seeing us. You obey your mother? - I thought you're our best buddy. Look who's coming. Hey, Erol. What's up? - You petty retard! Are you crazy? - He can't do a thing anymore. If he goes ballistic again it's me taking all the heat. I want my peace. - Are you a retiree? Retiree is good. Don't hit me ever again! I get plenty by my old man. You're my buddy. - Sorry. - Asshole. - Sorry! - Asshole! He apologized. - Yes, ok. Could you pull strings for me? Dealer suits me. I know lots of potheads. - Oh sure, you in the know. Drugs what? - Exactly. For you everything... is party and funny. You don't take anything serious. What about this evening? Are you coming? He won't show up. - Really. Really. Could I bum some weed? - Don't shit me. Is your cousin running out of weed or what? Keep yourself down. - What are you gonna do? What I gonna do? - Do you want another one? That's it. - What? That's it for 20 Euro. - It's just around the corner. Sure, except it isn't. It's still 10 kilometers to go. Or do you think you're Mona Lisa. Out. - How nice of you. Susie. [Following dialog doesn't make sense. Don't blame the translator.] What's your occupation? - Usually I take care of the household... but I'm currently living with my sister. - So, real estate? Not really. I'm a homemaker and mother. You didn't mention the mother part in your resumee. I did but I was told you like children. So put it in your resumee. My son is almost grown up... - Do you like sex? and jobs. Yes, and you? - Of course... else I wouldn't have asked. I can imagine 100 things I would like to do with you. Just to be up-front. Bye. - Good bye. Do you know Tarek? - Don't know. You forgot him? - You introduced too many. I can't remember names. - Your height, short hair, Tarek. He awaits you in the park next to the stairs. You know where? - Yes, stairs. Take the Coke. He needs supplies. If something is missing... - I pay. Aren't you ashamed? - I hope his bet tanks. Muttering something about my bet? Sorry, I didn't recognize you. - Piss off. Piss off! Drink up your Coke and piss off as well, ok. What you're doing here? - I want to propose an offer. What offer? - It's about an apartment. Shouldn't we meet again? You're kidding, right? I show up every day. You noticed my child. Do you think I shit money. Motherfuckers! Fuck you, assholes. I won't bother you again, ever. Take care and don't get snatched. I expected you at the stairs. - Who told you? Barut. - Women are hotter here. Where's the stuff? We play ball later. Ah, ingenious. Something else? - 1500. Got any money? - Nope. I'll sort out the matter with Barut later, ok? I'm waiting. - What? I keep waiting. - Didn't you get it? Later, ok! Nada later, Tarek. - Stay relaxed. I'm relaxed. I just need the money. - Fuck, split! Go home. When are we leaving? - Drink more and talk less. When are we leaving... blablabla. Problems? - He didn't pay, I didn't deliver. Where is it now? Tarek didn't pay and you didn't give it to him? He put up with that? You got balls. Did you ever bet? - No. - Sex? - What about Tarek? Tarek is my problem now. She's my sister, ok? My sister. Well, well, Mr. Gerber. Another crime? Nope, I pick up your mother. - Hold on. Wasn't nice. - What's he up to? He proposed an offer. - We're moving to your place? I wouldn't talk to her again. Dweeb. A friend of his is looking for a follow-up tenant. Kind of caretaker. Here in Neukolln? - No, Steglitz. Now, that's a sound offer. Come in. - Thanks. Hello. Ok, Hamal. Does it have to be now? Allright. I check it. Yes, right now. Bye. The sun is rising... I have to go. - What's up? Don't know. It's urgent. - Who is it? No, have to do something. Have fun with your something. - That's not the point. Won't take long. I heard how smooth it goes. - Thanks. I need you to fix a problem. - Now? A good customer is waiting. I trust you, you know that, right? - Sure. And? - Same routine. Except it's not dope. - But? Coca. - Coca Cola? You're cool with it? - I don't care. But I do. Involves a lot of money. Familiar with Wedding? Amsterdamer 6. Remember it. Ring at Hagenbeck. I won't write it down. Yes, sounds german. - Is that an issue for you? Be glad you get this customer. Here, 50 Euro. Take a taxi both ways. Ok? - No problem. Hey, help me. - You want this upstairs? Don't babble help me instead. Why not take it to a dealer's garage? - Crappy place for ripping you off. You want to Hagenbeck, right? - Are you Hagenbeck? No but we share the apartment. The bum intended to help me originally. Holger! Where are you, you stupid fuck. What's with the shouting? - Hi Jule, you look good. Could you fetch Holger? - Did you take the wrong turn? Haha. Ask him to come downstairs. Why don't you ask him yourself? - Don't bitch and let him know. Holger! There you're. Why did it take so long? I told you I won't help you. It's an exceptionally stupid idea. Oil and gas foul the whole apartment. Come on. Help carrying and it disappears in my room in a jiffy. What's with you? - I want to you. Then come along. Elke, could you push over? Hello. - Ignore her, she's always like this. Sit. Say... did the arab undergo a brain amputation. Why? - How old are you? 15, 16? - Now he sends children. Whatever. You're here. Pass it along. How does it smell like? Nothing. - Why did you smell then? Looks cool, eh? Do you know what you brought me? Cocaine. - At least you know. Elke, fetch the scale. Elke, can you get the scale? The scale. From the kitchen. Scale. Maybe she should take less drugs. - I don't do drugs. Okay. - Did you get it? I don't do drugs. Is ok, me neither. - Then sit and shut up. Jule? - Yes. Could you check it? - Sure. Could be novocain. What's with the money? - Oh, this is a pro. Look at this pro. What's wrong with you? Relax. You're not relaxed. You get your money. Rocks. Stay casual. Relax. You're all tensed up. Look this way. Here. You should relax... Better now? - Yes. Okay. Now you get your money. It's 80.000. Should I call a taxi? You shouldn't take the subway with so much money. Thanks but I find one. - Thanks for the prompt delivery. Elke. Could you walk our guest to the door? Bye. I really don't do drugs. - You know what? I believe you. Really. - I'm passed the bible. A good spot to stand around. I guess we drop the coffee. - I wouldn't have asked either. You don't like coffee? - Bosh. I... I love coffee. I think it's time for me to set off. - Yes. Bye. - Bye. Hi peewee. Late for bed? - You want something? You can't do a thing. - What? Ho, ho! - Give it to me! He advanced to a drug runner. What would Hamal do if the money disappears? He cuts off your balls. How much is inside? 20, 30? What do you thing? - I don't care. Me neither. Fuck, what happend? - Idiot! Stop. My backpack lays on the roof. Then you have to go to lost and found tomorrow. Erol threw the backpack on the train. I couldn't prevent it. He... What was I supposed to do? He knows I'm working for you. - Calm down! He knew what he's doing. Barut, take a few guys. I want my money back! What happened? Erol snatched the boy. I'm missing 80.000. They didn't find anything. Come in. Is something inside your backpack with your name tag. My purse. - That's a problem. So are you. - Maybe it's at lost and found. They gonna check it in any case. What do you think they're going to do... if they find 80.000 inside the backpack of a 15 year old? What do you want to tell the cops? - I found it? You found the money, right? I won't mention you at all. That's for sure. Hm. - No, I won't tell them. And if the money is gone... I pay it back or work for you. It's not about the money. Hey, look at me. It's about a gesture. Come, step out. Hamal, you get your money back! I swear. - You think it's about money? Money has nothing to do with it. You're a disgrace. It's not about you either anymore. All you can do now is praying. Take it out. Go on. Take it out. What I'm supposed to do? - Shoot yourself! Or do you have a better idea? You or he. It's your choice. Do you want to die, Michael? I mean you don't want to die, or? One doesn't shoot himself. Do you want to shoot us all? Do you really think it has 6 bullets? Maybe it's just a test and it has no bullets. Shoot him. So you don't want to die? Good. Then aim at his neck. Go on, aim at his neck. Go closer. Do it right. The neck, behind the ear. There. Help, please. Get closer. Go on. See, it wasn't that difficult. Let's go. Come on. Do you want to wait for the cops? Are you afraid? Do you think anyone can frame us? We'll sit in a restaurant and cheer on you. We're invisible, Michael. It's over. Get in, he isn't worth it. Get in. [The Kills "No Wow"]
