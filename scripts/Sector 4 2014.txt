People used to call us mercenaries, guns for hire, soldiers of fortune. Whatever they call us, the job always stays the same. When shit really hits the fan and the military can't touch it, they give us a call. The commando team of four, been together for about eight years with dozens of missions all over the world, never lost a man. We live and die by our motto... no one left behind. These words are really important to us. Just like any soldiers, we know the risk of each mission. But we also know and trust each other with our lives every single day. That is until the day you wake up and you realize that you are in way over your head and there is no one who can help. This is our story. Have a seat, Nash. Let's get down to business. I'd like to introduce you to Mohamed Asan, or T3, as the boys in DC call him. Number three on the Al-Qaeda most-wanted list. Very well-trained, very difficult to track. CIA's been following this guy for two years. Every time they think they have him... poof, he just disappears. The man's a fucking ghost. He travels in small groups, often with women and children to avoid air strikes. We've currently got intel that he's leading a small force operating out of the lower quadrant of Sector 4. Sector 4, sir? Why? That a problem? It's a mess down there, sir. It's the red zone. That's why they called us. When do we leave? ASAP. Get your team together. Copy that. Commander Reynolds on deck. Confirming two souls on board, dark-colored pickup, traveling west-bound towards village. Keep your eyes on the target. Do we have confirmation Tango 3 is in the vehicle? It's now confirmed Tango 3 is on board. We have visual on the target. - Scramble the jets. - Sir. Countdown 55, space checker at transponder setting 03 Alpha, 4750. All right, target one by the entrance. - Three plus... - I'm picking up a signal. It looks like we've got some friendlies in Sector 4. Sector 4? We don't have anybody in Sector 4. We have guys over in Sector 5. 4 should be clear. All right, what do you have for me? Target one, by the entrance. Three plus down. Target one. Three plus down. I am showing something from that area, sir. Those are our GPS signals. A team of four? - All right, let me contact I-Corps. - Sir. All right then. Wind, three knots east-west. The wind... three knots east-west. There's no way we could be positive it's our guys. All right, and target two... four feet left to target one. Target two acquired. We have degree coordinates on that target. Confirming the grid, 68-niner 517. This could be Al-Qaeda trying to throw us off. Understood, sir. Proceeding with the strike. All right, boss, ready fur your call. Fire. We've got heavy contact! Shit! Ahh! Oh shit! What was that?! Air strike! What the fuck was that? Where the hell did all these people come from? - I'm on red! Cover me, Scott! - I got it, I got it! On the ground! I'm green. Clear! - Ah! - Copy that! - Cover me! - Watch out! Ah! - Move into the cave! - Go! Moving! Go! Go, let's get to the cave! Roger that! Moving. Let's go. - Shit! Ahhh! - Shit. - We've got one man down! - Nash, I'm hit. - Nash, Nash... - I got you, I got you. Okay! Ahh! Oh, shit! Son of a... - Put pressure. - Shit! I got you. - Put pressure on that! - Yeah, I can make it. Yeah. We got heavy contact! Green 745. - All right, let's go! Move move move! - My leg! Oh, Nash! What the fuck was that? Fuck Al-Qaeda. Guys, what's your status? What's your status? I got contact left! Contact right, contact right! Allahu akbar! They're everywhere! Nash, what's your location? Steve, what's your location? What's your location? Hold on, I'm coming for you. Pizza! Pizza! Pizza! No running in the house. I like what you did with the house. Thanks! I know I shouldn't spend the money, but I get lonely. He's gone for months at a time. I have to find some way to keep myself from going crazy. Think you're going crazy? It's been over three months since Scott left. That's how long it's been since I've had sex. Try living in the same house as your ex-husband and his son - and see how great your sex life is. - Oh, no way. I don't know. After this mission's over, I only want three things... peace, love... and sex. Yeah, I want more sex. - Pizza pizza! - This is so good, guys. Thanks, Mom! It's 20 individuals. Roger tally. Right door. American. clear, anytime, come in on that road. I got individuals everywhere. Alpha 4, we've got confirmation of friendly in the area, running north away from the village. I love you, Dad. Your son needs you. Keep eyes on target. Roger. What's your location. Charlie 5, Charlie 6 has gut bingo. Charlie 1 through 6, return to base. 7-India-53, one length to location. You have the call. They're on their way, sir. All right, let's pump him up. I have an update on Operation Mikaela, sir. - Let's have it! - The enemy focused most of their strength on this area during the attack. Much higher numbers than we anticipated. Okay, what about the target? Unfortunately, the target escaped, sir. What's the status of the contractors? We received a friendly GPS signal in the area. We had no way of knowing it was the contractors, so we proceeded with the air strike. We lost all of them but one. - What the fuck just happened?! - I just heard it myself. I don't know all the details yet. The details are simple... you're in charge of the private fucking contractors, and they got in the middle of a fire zone when we launched an air strike! We may have just killed our own men. It'll be taken care of. Son of a bitch. I'm hit! Nash, I'm hit! A knock would be more appropriate, if you don't mind. Roger that. Where's Max? He's out back playing. You know, he asks about you a lot. I'm running out of excuses. When are you going to stop blaming yourself for the past and start being a better father to your son? It's not too late for that, you know? I'm working on it, okay? Dad! - Dad? - Buddy? Do you know that the Grand Canyon's over 6,000 feet deep, and over 20 football fields and 277 miles long? No, I didn't know that. - You didn't? - No. But you said we can go to the Grand Canyon one day. You know what? I know I promised you we'd go to the Grand Canyon. You know? But I'm telling you... I promise, okay? Okay. Oh, I love you, buddy. Come here. I love you, Dad. You have a phone call, boss. Thank you, Jacob. Nash? Sir, I just received an email, I don't know from who. It's a video, sir. Excuse me? They're alive, sir. I see. And what exactly would you like us to do about it? We need to get them out, sir. We don't have much time. Mikaela was classified. There's no way we can go back now. Sir, you're telling me you know my men are alive and you're not going to do anything about it, right? You know what you're getting into every time you accept a mission. That's the life you chose. That's why you're making the big bucks, pal. No one gets left behind, sir. You're not soldiers, you're mercenaries. No one cares about a team of hired guns getting stuck behind enemy lines. You know what? The more I think back to that mission... the air strikes, the men that were not supposed to be there... the more I think you're covering up something, sir. I'm sorry, Nash. There's nothing I can do. He going back. This is Aisha Nasser, reporting live from the Afghanistan/Pakistan border, a region now referred to as Sector 4. It is believed that many of the top Al-Qaeda leaders are operating out of this area. Recently, the government deemed Sector 4 to be a red zone... an area too unsafe to orchestrate ground assaults by US troops, making many of the top Al-Qaeda leaders seemingly untouchable by the US troops. This is Aisha Nasser reporting live from Sector 4. Back to you. Come on! Come on! Come on! Do it! Do it, you fucking pig! Do it! Chickenshit! Fuck! You don't have the guts! Come on! Come on! Gaaaah! What the fuck are you looking at? Are you all right? - Buddy. - Come on. You doin' all right? I can't take this anymore. We're getting out of here. We're not going to get out of here. Yeah. We're gonna wait. I'm done waiting. Nash will be here. You'll see. You know, in the war days... I was in the same situation. I lost some... I lost some of my nearest friends. They were left behind, but I was told to stand down. I did. Not a day goes by I don't think about those faces or see them. If you're going to go to one of the craziest parts of the world... the most dangerous... you're going to have to fight the people, the elements, the weather, the desert, the snow, skydive... by yourself. You need to get mentally strong so you can survive and see your kid. Make sure you say good night to him. Let's do it. We gotta get the fuck out of here. How do you suppose we're gonna get the fuck out of here? We've been a team for how long? How long? Our wives hang out together... we're a team. Yeah, he's not going to leave anybody behind. I feel pretty fucking abandoned. Been, what? 70-some fuckin' days in here? Ain't no one coming for us. He's gonna come for us. He's gonna be here. Just trust him. Trust him... he'll be here. Dude, that's gonna get you killed. We're gonna get killed anyway. At least this is going to be my way. My kids are not going to watch their dad have his head cut off and watch it on TV. Nash will be here. He'll be here. You'll see. He'll be here. You just gotta stand down and be a little stronger. He'll be back. You're going back, aren't you? Yep. You know, I actually thought this time was going to be different. For the first time I believed that you were going to change things and be a better father to Max. I can't leave them behind. What about Max? You're leaving him behind. All this week he's been talking about the trip that you two were supposed to take to the Grand Canyon. That should be your priority. Jesus, Nash. I know you could care less what happened between us. Lord knows I'm over it. I really love those guys too. But a real man, a good father, knows when to turn his back and let somebody else take care of the problem. There is nobody else. You're just trying to play hero so you can feel better about yourself. Meanwhile I'm taking care of Max, not knowing if you're coming back. Which is why I divorced you. We live in the same house, and I am okay with that, but don't go out and get yourself killed. Your son needs you more than anyone. I promise I'll be back. I promise. "Dear Max, I want you to remember how much I love you. I promise that when I return we'll go to the Grand Canyon and visit all the places that you can imagine. I miss you already and I love you. Love, Dad." Shalom. - You ready? - Shalom. You know I can't teach you how to fight. But I can teach you how to survive so you can come back. Let's go. - Hello? - Hey, Kristoff. This is Charlie. How you doin', man? Charlie! Oh, my friend. How are you? Very very very busy. Very busy. Haven't spoke to you in ages. Last time I heard you were dead. Mm-hmm. Sorry, buddy, I'm not dead yet. Listen, I'm gonna go on a little vacation pretty soon. - I'm gonna need a couple things. - Vacation, huh? Are you going to visit your old friends from last trip, hmm? How do you know about that? Facebook! What do you think? So when are you planning this trip of yours? Very soon. No problem, no problem. Anything you want. Make sure you take care of me, okay? Not like last time, okay? Don't screw it up. Charlie, come on, really? Of course, no no. Make sure you say hi to the wives. I am honest Russian man. Yes, boy. Yak yak yak yak! All right, just take care of me, all right? No problem, no problem. All right, thanks, I appreciate that. All right, see you soon, okay? Bye, ciao. Gun! Gun! Gun! Clear clear clear, move! Engage! Gun! Gun! Two-round hammer drill left target, transition to the right target, two-round hammer drill. Copy that? - Copy that. - Shooter ready? - Ready! - Stand by. Gun! Gun! Two rounds all the way around. Copy that? - Copy that. - Stand by. Gun! Gun! - Contact front! - Contact front. Clear! - Move! - Moving. Contact front! Clear! Check rear! Move! Contact front! Contact left! Contact front! Contact front! Contact left! Contact right! Contact front! Contact front! Contact left! Cease fire! We got visual on Tango 3. Spasibo. So you want to buy some firearms, right? I have amazing guns for you, my friend. Love Americans so much, especially your money. So, um, you ready? Oh my God. Barum! Look at these, baby. Mwah! Yeah. Brand-new weapon. Very good in combat. Quite pricey, though. Very expensive model. What about that one? How much for that one? Oh, my friend, that one. This one... a very good gun. I'll cut you amazing deal... 500 Americans. Great price for amazing gun. Hmm! What about I give you $200 for the rifle, I give you $200 for the handgun and $100 for the... for the ammo? How's that? - Mmm. - Good? You son of a bitch, my friend. I'll cut your throat when you sleep. Ahhh! Sounds good! - We got a deal? - We got a deal. All right. Euros or pound sterling? Hmm? Do you take credit cards? Credit cards? Are you kidding me? Credit cards! You most secret in a desert and you want credit cards? Cash, my friend. Only cash. Military caches are buried all along this area. Come here, come here, I'll show you. There's numbers. Mm-hmm-hmm. 60 up up and west, and you can get whatever you want there. So many explosives... wow. That's for you. How do I get there though? I need a car, so... Ah. Oh boy, I have no cars. No... no cars. No no no. My... my cousin Tolia is fuckin' great car dealer. He has amazing cars. So good cars. And great super-cheap prices for you. And I'm gonna call him 'cause I care about my customers. And you're my favorite, my best friend, even more. And he gonna give you discount. He gonna come here for you... come right here for you, deliver car, the one you want. You enjoy the weather, mountains. I give you sun lotion even, so you can enjoy yourself. All right? And he gonna come here and sell you cars, right? Amazing? Oh, my friend, pleasure doing business. Pleasure. - Sure. - My best friend! My best friend. English. My cousins do not speak English. But I do. They never let me hang out with them when they're doing their business. They say I'm too young. But they let me come today because I learn English in school. Hmm. How nice of them. So, listen, I have a long drive. Do you think this car is going to take me to where I want to go? He says it works like clockwork. Hmm! Okay. Clockwork? Yes, clockwork. Good. Listen, Kristoff told me $200. He says, uh... they want to know how much you have in your wallet. How much I have in my wallet? Yes. Oh boy, I guess a deal is not a deal. The man who sent you... Kristoff... they tell me he owes them a lot of money. Since you're his friend, they want to take it from you. Hmm. Well, first of all I'm not his friend. And secondly, I just have $200. They have little time. Huh. Yup. Opa! America... Whoa whoa... Check the safety, asshole. Get in the car. Get in the car! Get the fuck out of here, you bitch. Allahu akbar! Salaam alaikum. This is Aisha Nasser, reporting live from the Afghanistan Pakistan border. Information regarding the recent attack on the Afghanistan Pakistan border has just been released earlier today. It is believed that following the attack, three private US military contractors have been held hostage by an Al-Qaeda group operating in the area led by Mohamed Asan, number three on the most-wanted list. No demands have been issued at this time. This marks the fourth instance in which several contractors have been involved in the red-zone area in Afghanistan. Previous instances left several contractors dead. Reporting back to you. I have some intel for you regarding Sector 4. About your captive men? Not exactly. It's about the one that got out. He's going back. After what happened with that last mission, you're going to send someone back? And on government funds, no less? No, we didn't orchestrate this at all. He's doing it on his own. And why would he do that? Yeah, "no one left behind." I think that's the phrase he used. A mercenary that gives a fuck. Great. If your intel on bin Laden is correct, you may be privy to his location. So what are you telling me for? I'm just waiting for the right moment to strike... a diversion, a hole in their security. Oh, I can personally guarantee that once Nash is in the area, a real shitstorm is going to start. I want you to keep me informed on every move Nash makes... every move he makes, you keep me posted. Understood. Don't move. Shit. Whoa whoa whoa, don't think about it. Whoa whoa, okay, easy. You won't find anything there anyway. Who the fuck are you?! - Daniels. - Jones. - Paulson. - Fuck, you guys. You scared the shit out of me. Reynolds gave us intel you'd be coming out here. Didn't expect to see you so soon. Got out here pretty quick for a private military contractor. Three of us have been out here the past four months tracking Number 3. We hear you created quite the shitstorm a few months back going after Number 3. There were four. One of us was compromised. Heard the screams, but we never found the body. If you're looking for weapons and explosives, this is where you'll find 'em. I hope you like to swim. We hear you're going back after your boys. It's a suicide mission. You know that. - Any intel? - Yeah, about 15-20 strong. Packed up the village a couple hours ago. Heading to the hideout. It's marked on your map. Good luck. Let's have it. Sir, Nash has just made contact with Delta and the map's been delivered. He's on track, just as we were anticipating, heading straight fur the cache. His ETA to final destination is 48 hours, if he survives. Shalom. Don't forget... come back alive to your son. Yeah, sat work has it by 30 miles. Keep your eye on the target. Hey! American! Guys, it's me. Let's move. Get the guns. Pick up the weapons. Get the weapons. Get down! Brad, watch the door! Watch the door! Brad, what's your status?! Ahhh! For Scott. Ahh! Shit, let's go! Come on! Nash, he's gone, he's gone, come on! He's not gone! Brad, Brad! Let's go! - Nash, come on! - No, you're not dead. Stay with me! - He is dead! - Come on, Brad, stay with me! - He is dead. He got hit! Let's go! - He's not gone! I won't leave anybody behind, you understand? God, look at him, center mass! Let's go! Come on! Get in the truck! We gotta move now! Stay with me, you understand? - Stay with me! - Get in the truck! Nash, come on, get in the truck. Get in the truck! Are you okay, man? I don't know. What happened to Scott? They killed him. Salaam alaikum. This is Aisha Nasser reporting live once again from the Afghanistan Pakistan border. As conflict continues to rise in the Middle East, the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden are still unknown. However, drone surveillance has shown heavy activity near the the Afghanistan! Pakistan border, AKA: Sector 4, which the government has recently deemed too dangerous to engage in combat, causing a stalemate in the war on Al-Qaeda. This is Aisha Nasser, reporting back to you. Hey, thank you. From me and my family, thank you. You're welcome, buddy. You would have done the same thing for me. Yeah. I would have tried. Okay. Raven, this is Echo 1. DO you got the grid? Did you copy that? Yeah, sat work has it by 30 miles. Roger that. "Against our recommendation, Nash traveled to Sector 4 via civilian means and began a large ground assault on Al-Qaeda forces in the area. We intercepted contact leading us to believe that both Nash and the hostages are unfortunately D-E-A-D." - Hold on, Nash. - Morning, sir. Go on with your report. I can't wait to hear what happened next. Go on. It is good to see you, Nash. Is it? So how are the men? I got Steven out. Brad and Scott are dead, but I'm sure you already know that, don't you, sir? I'm sorry about that, Nash. Really, I am. But like I said, that's why you guys make the big bucks, right? You risk it all. You are the one who sent me that video. You knew bin Laden's location, knowing that I would go back in Sector 4, create enough chaos so it would open the window for the military to move in on bin Laden. Am I correct, sir? With less forces protecting bin Laden, the better chance we had to take him out - with safety to our men. - What about my men? You used them as bait. You sent us on a suicide mission, sir. The only problem is I am still alive. Men like us don't operate on nobility and honor, so don't... so don't bullshit with some hero act. War has become a very lucrative business and made me a very rich man. So how much will it take? Hmph! Nothing is going to change anyway. So I want a proper military service for my two men. That's number one. Number two, I want a big check and I mean a big one. And number three, I want out for good, sir. I'll miss you. Okay, here we go. That'll buy your kid a nice shiny new bike. Hmm. It's not only for me, sir. I'm sorry to hear that, Nash. I had a job lined up you'd be the perfect man for. I'm sure you did. I already got a job, sir. Thank you. Damn, I thought he was dead. No one left behind. We lived and died by those words. Turns out, maybe we did not understand what that meant, who was actually being left behind. Many soldiers lose their lives to save others. Not everyone understands why they do it, sometimes not even their own family, because they are the ones left behind, the ones that have to deal with the loss and the pain. But now I'm making the same promise to you and Max... to never leave you behind again.
