We must elect Radhe Bhaiyya's candidate... as the general secretary of our union once again this year Here are the benefits if Radhe Bhaiyya's candidate wins You can go watch a movie and your attendance will still be recorded You can carry notes to cheat in the exams No action will be taken for winking at pretty girls The famous dance party from Delhi has already arrived... all arrangements for the celebration are in place We're only waiting for the results to be declared I've spent so much in this election If I lose this election, I'll have to commit suicide Hey, Hemant bhaiyya... why will you commit suicide? It's Kanak Sharma who's going to die. I'll murder the bastard Are you out of your mind? Why do you keep talking nonsense? Alex has told me. I'll bump off the bastard Tiwari, skip the blah-blah You aren't supposed to think aloud Radhe! "Sweetheart..." "sweetheart..." "my heart says, sweetheart..." "come and meet me..." "don't ever go far away from me" "No, no, no..." "I'm not falling in love..." "don't steal my heart..." "don't get closer to me" "Look, let me tell you..." "in love, when you say no, it means yes" "Pretty girls' excuses are ages old, no one has ever figured them out" "They won't say a word, their eyes do the talking..." "and they steal our hearts" "You'd better admit it..." "those who fall in love, shed tears" "Some gain, some lose, some smile, some cry..."

The sound of your daughter's melodious voice every morning... erases all our worries You finished your 12th. What have you planned to do next, my child? She's going to attend college now. - What will she gain in college? She's going to be married after all My son-in-law to-be has expressed the wish that she studies further I see. Is that true, Rameshwar? Yes, Uncle. All I could learn at the tutelage was the Vedas At least she must be a graduate So you want a wife who speaks English! But you know how things are at the college, don't you? Kids in Agra study less and watch movies more Nirjara is not like that. And she has Indu for company She'll take the 7:35 a.m. Frontier Mail every morning The college is near the station. As soon as her classes are over... she'll take the 16:35 express train back "Away from a world of hatred..." "in a world of love..." "may you find happiness, my friend..." "When an animals kill man..." "And now man has slain an animal..." "why is the world quiet?" "Give me that pickle" I'm told there was a furore yesterday. You got into a fight at the college Fight? No, brother. I broke their legs If I had not got there on time, Alex's men would have killed Kanak Why do you need to interfere in someone else's affairs? He's a friend. Would I remain silent, if someone came to beat you up? Besides, it's my college It was! How many years is it since you passed out of college? But you still hang out there. For no rhyme or reason Will you spend the life of a vagabond or find some work to do? Enough. Let him have the breakfast in peace Give me a puri, sister-in-law. - Why one? Help yourself to 50 Feed him the free food and make a stronger bull out of him So he can keep attacking everyone! Here's your puri, your bread... and your milk Don't waste the food Radhe... - No Listen, Radhe... - No, sister-in-law See that? You made him get up while he was eating! The skies haven't fallen. You're the one who has spoilt him He goes around with that horrible hair of his... and makes a few others hang out with him too I don't know what he's going to do in life Radhe's an old student of the college He rags the new students with his friends Don't look at them! Just keep walking Look, Radhe. There's a fresher with Indu Listen come here Not you. Go to your class and get on with your studies First year? B.A. Pass course can't you say good morning to your seniors? Not like that. Say it like an attentive soldier Keep saluting me like that every time you pass by All right. - What's that? And what's this? - A peacock feather I can see that. But why have you kept it in a book? Kept in a notebook, it doubles Must be laying eggs! What's in the box? Wow! Puri and a vegetable dish Nice No, don't wipe your hands on my shirt! What are you doing, Radhe! Don't wipe it with that. It'll be a sin What's your name? Nirjara Meaning? - Meaning? It's my name It's very a difficult name. So I asked for the meaning I don't know. - Who named you? My mother did So ask your mother. - She's dead Is your father alive? - Yes So ask him when you come tomorrow All right. - Thanks You saved me from sinning The lunch-box When that peacock feather doubles, give me one! Father, why did Ma name me Nirjara? Because your mother loved my mother Your grandma. Her name was Nirjara Devi too What does it mean, father? Why do you need to know today? Tell me, father.

In the name of Radhe Mohan Excuse me... please come here Hello. - Hello So you are the priest's daughter? Yes, we are Brahmins My father says, our forefathers used to be priests in this very temple I know nothing about my forefathers. What I do know is that... my great grandfather used to play hockey for the English team My grandfather played hockey with Gyanchand and Dhyanchand In extras, too. My father broke his thumb while playing football So he took to selling hockey sticks Is that why you beat everyone with hockey sticks? What? - What happened? Something in my eye Here... give it some heat You found out what your name means? - Yes What is it? - Nirjara "Jar" means death. So Nirjara means lmmortality There's a religious interpretation too One's soul is tied to his deeds Deep meditation frees the soul. And that is called Nirjara Here you are. - What's that? Gujia (a snack) Got a few more? - Yes For my niece Where did you buy it? - Not bought it. I myself made it Both are nice The Gujia and your name too. - Your name is nice too Radhe Mohan is another name for Lord Krishna. You know that? Your attention, ladies and gentlemen! She first said "ras" (juice) She then said "gul" (rose) And then she said "le" (take) Listen, ras, gul and le... that's how she broke up the rasgollah! Thank you very much She's now going to bore us to death with a poem clear your throat! "Stars are nothing but the Sun of the night" "Like the West is also East" We get that! So what happens next? Go on, Nirjara They won't let me speak North in South, East in West... so what's new? I've taken the trouble of coming to the stage... because I've liked her poem very much And since I have liked it, you will like it too. Get that? Those who understand will quietly listen to the recital... and those who don't, will still sit quietly and listen Everything's under control. Please come clap for her "Stars are nothing but the Suns of the night" "Like the West is also the East" "The Earth is the daughter of the Sun..." "suspended on a bed in the skies" "The Sun is an eye-full of light..." "spread everywhere around" "Where are my..." Radhe-ji... my recital is over "How I love meeting you, and talking to you" "What's all this about and why... I don't know" "But whatever it is..."

"yours is the name etched on my heart" "What's all this about and why... I don't know" "But whatever it is..." "I love it" "How I love meeting you, and talking to you" Radhe...? - Yes, sis-in-law? What are you doing here at this hour of the night? I couldn't go to sleep. So I thought I'd read a book Why do you need a book so late in the night? Say something! Funny! Stop here Sister... haven't your husband and Rahul come? This is the limit How can he separate a child from his mother, for the sake of money? God! Atmaram used to make demands of 20 and 30,000 rupees earlier He's asking for 200,000 now Remaining silent will not do, Guruji We'll have to do something about it There's no need to do anything. I don't want to live with that man I'll find some work here... I'll help you in your work I'll raise the money in a few days and bring back my Rahul My son must be so harassed Gardener... Is this 7\32? - Yes, it is. So? I want to meet the one stays here. - I'm the one. Go on Not you. We wish to see Radhe Sir What for? - We'll tell him that Just go and tell him that there's someone here to see him All right Sit down inside. I'll call him Who's it? Are my pants all right? Go on So what brings you here? - Actually... What's her name? - Indu Indu-ji, will you please let her speak? Go on Actually... - Say nothing First tell me what you will have, Tea, coffee, a cold-drink? Samosas, biscuits...? - Nothing lmpossible. This is the first time you've come to my house. Have something Aslam... - Yes? Get some Diet coke and samosas from Balwant He makes excellent samosas. And listen... give me a cigarette. Mine are over Here you are. - Come back soon Aslam... come here Yes, brother? - Who are they? They study in our college. - I see Sir, we have a problem The exams start tomorrow and Nirjara is very upset Why? Hasn't she been studying? No, actually... - She has lost her admission card I had kept it in my book. It has gone missing So? - A notice on the college board says... they won't allow us to appear for the exams without the card You have come to me with such a small problem? Know what? We'll tear out the notice board and throw it away When the notice board is thrown away, you can appear for the exams can't we request the Principal? Actually, Nirjara... I don't make requests What I say once is the final call Piping hot samosas! Keep it here Have a diet coke Here you are Have some samosas For you For you Have the samosas and coke... and leave the tension to me For you Is there anything else I can send, Radhe Sir? No thanks. Everything's here. I don't need anything Not even you catch The phone won't ring ever People raise a loan to either buy a house or for education But you write the reason as... I want to pay the money to my in-laws and bring my son back You haven't written anything in the column meant for sureties? If I had something to mortgage, why would I come here for a loan? We need some guarantee that you will repay the loan You mean honesty has no value at all? In that case, give me your honesty. I'll create a charge on it, okay? Well? Where is your honesty? - What things are you saying to me? I don't want any loan from you. Thank you! I'll find many who'll give me a loan My exams went off well. But I'm a bit scared Don't be scared. God will take care of everything How did your exams go? - Very well If you want your marks increased, let me know. I can get it down Oh yes, certainly. - Let her talk to me Well, thank you Well, Radhe...? She was profusely thanking you. What's up? She lost her identity card and sought my help to appear for the exams That's very careless of her! Hey girl... Forget it. She's a decent girl. - Decent girl means a lovable girl Which means an innocent girl. - Which means a good girl The gentleman appears to have changed What do you mean by a good girl? - She sings well When did she sing for you? - She was singing hymns in the temple His grandma and mine also sing nice hymns... but you never went to the temple to listen to them My brother and sister-in-law dragged me there So she sings nice hymns. Can't be anything else Well... what's that called? Gujia. She makes nice gujias So you had the Gujias too? - Yes Why are you eyes so red? I couldn't sleep all night. - Sleep is lost, peace is lost Do you at least feel hungry? - Radhe bhaiyya's a gone case! He's fallen in love with her! Look at his face! Isn't he blushing! Don't talk nonsense! Aslam, Radhe appears to have changed nowadays Love is spoiling him rotten, sister-in-law What? Are you speaking the truth? - Don't you know? It's the girl who came to your house the other day The one I brought the samosas and the diet coke for Oh yes, I guessed something was fishy You know the priest, who keeps ringing the bell without any clothes on? She's his daughter. - Must you talk like that about elders? Why not? He's going to be related to you, isn't he? Rascal Sister-in-law, give me a thousand rupees At once Here, have a laddoo I have a sweet-heart. I don't need laddoos You need them badly, go ahead and eat it Here you are. - What's this? I need only 1000 rupees Keep it. You might need it. - Why a couple of thousands? Stuff five or ten thousand in his pocket It isn't from the money you give me. It's from my savings, keep it Let's go, Aslam Why did you have to give that good-for-nothing anymore money? Why do you want to spoil him even more? Wrong! It's time for our Radhe to turn a new leaf Really? Did you hear that in a divine announcement? He has fallen in love What? Fallen in love? - Yes Radhe's in love? - Yes I wonder which girl has been struck by misfortune! Don't say such inauspicious things. You didn't ask me who the girl is As if you won't tell unless I ask It's the one we met at the temple. She sang in such a sweet voice It's the priest's daughter who even came to our house Oh yes... - She reminds me of my sister... who's no more. - There she goes again The same features, the same smile and laughter Hurry up, move it Move it! Hey glasses... aren't you satisfied topping for three years? Get up This one's old enough to be a mother and she's still studying Watch it, Aslam. She's a lecturer! - Lecturer? Madam, will you please go out? Have you eaten? - Yes My friends have been ribbing me of late They say, my love story's all set, all fixed up. But I told them... It's another matter that I've changed a bit over the last week or two I'm beginning to feel a sense of responsibility I'm thinking of taking up a nice job In a beer bar, you know. The job of a bouncer or a bodyguard I don't get a word of what you're saying That's exactly what I love about you. You don't get anything at all All right, I'll explain Now look at this and this... carefully What happened? A clap, right? It happened when this hand and this hand came close together You're one hand, I'm the other We ought to meet like that Radhe's using philosophy to reason with her You must be wondering whether my folks will accept you, isn't it? But you needn't worry. They are very orthodox, no doubt But if I don't eat for a day or two, everything will be all right If your father creates any trouble, right under his ear, on the neck... I'll give him a tight slap Fifteen days after our marriage, he won't know where he is You heard what I said? That's full and final Yes That... "O ascetic..." "I've fallen in love with you" "I've fallen in love" "My eyes yearn to see your face" "My eyes yearn to see you, I shed tears when I miss you..." "on my lips, is your name..." "in my breath, is your name..." "my heart... oh I've lost my heart" "I've fallen in love with you" "O hermit..." "Like a lotus blossoming in moonlight..." "is your lovely face, my love" "Like a couplet penned in simplicity..." "is your lovely face, my love" "My eyes yearn to see you, I shed tears when I miss you..." "on my lips, is your name..." "in my breath, is your name..." "my heart... oh I've lost my heart" "I've fallen in love with you" "Appear in my dreams, live in my heart..." "show me a glimpse of your beautiful face, my love" "Without you, my heart won't be placated anymore..." "come to me and don't go away ever" "My eyes yearn to see you, I shed tears when I miss you..." "on my lips, is your name..." "in my breath, is your name..." "my heart... oh I've lost my heart" "I've fallen in love with you" "I've fallen in love" You've come to the canteen after ages... and you're smiling to yourself? What's the matter? There's surely something brewing in his heart Don't hide it from your friends. Tell us... what's it all about? So you've reached a stage where you're exchanging gifts! For your girlfriend? Radhe... Nirjara chander, what's her brother's name? - Not brother. It's her fiance Rameshwar But you needn't be worried. The match isn't finalised yet, they're only talking about it What happened, mister? - Leave the bike at the stand But what is all this about? - I'll explain, I'll tell you... will you step aside, please? Master, send a cup of tea for the gentleman? No tea, send a cup of special coffee for him No, I won't have any tea or coffee It's time for my prayers. I must go home God is not running away He is where he is, you can sit here Sit down So, do you know him? No, who is he? You don't know him? You don't know your own folks? You ought to drown out of shame! He's related to you, you know Related? He isn't...? What lineage do you come from, mister? Are you going to pickle the lineage? Not the village... he's related to you through Nirjara. - How? He's your brother-in-law Brother-in-law Ponytail Go on, your brother-in-law's calling you Yes? Look, I'll tell you just once. Listen carefully I have a scene going with her. Who? Nirjara. I've settled it all with her yesterday Final. You get that? I mustn't see you with her again, okay? If I see you with her ever again, I'll set your ponytail on fire... and you'll fly into the skies like a rocket You get that? Go away Poor guy You've collected very little money in the bank, Archana? They take away all the money in the brokerage But you're getting a loan, aren't you? - Of course, why not? God! This is the limit! They've started a brothel right here in the locality Stop talking and get to work You go to number 3, and you go to number 5 The one who owned the house sold it and went away to Mumbai These people are not leaving the locality anymore God alone knows what's going to happen now Nirjara... one moment I... at the college yesterday... nothing, go on Not from here. Go from there I'll sit there, Nirjara. You sit here I've brought a gift for you I had bought it yesterday, but ponytail ruined my mood It's made to order. It'll look great in your feet No, I don't want it Feeling shy? Why do you have to be shy? Take it It isn't how you think it is No, it isn't how you think it is It isn't silver. It's white gold I don't have at heart the things you have But... in the library you said, you and I... People are watching. Please don't create a farce I'm the one who's being subjected to a farce Everyone in the college laughs at me. But I don't care for them We mustn't worry about them because... we have a whole life ahead of us. Take it now O God! I swear it on my education. I haven't any such thing on my mind Do you think I lack something? Have I bad habits? Am I not a nice man? Tell me, I'll change everything Nirjara... listen to me Hands off me! Thug! Rascal! I know this was going to happen! I had told you to say "I love you" to her I even wished you a happy married life! And you go and tell her that you'll slap her father "He'll wake up ten days after the marriage and wonder where he is" Forget about what has happened and think of the future I have an idea. Know what? Woo Indu, Nirjara's best friend. She'll lure Nirjara for you Shut up! He can't score with one girl, and you're talking about another! I have an idea too Let's write on the Taj Mahal: "With love from Radhe Mohan to Nirjara" She'll melt the moment she reads that Well? Didn't you like the idea? - Here, have some grams She called you a thug, didn't she? So stop getting into fights and brawls from today Turn into a good boy Your work will be done! You sway because there's a girl with you? I said I'm sorry. - Will that set everything right? Save him someone! Well? You aren't ashamed are you? When you get beaten up, you come to Radhe Mohan with your tail wagging? In trouble, some people invoke God and some invoke the devil! And there you were... crying Radhe! Radhe! Because we're your friends, must we getjust about anywhere for you... and do anything for you? But if you wear a salwar kameeZ... and come to us with Gujia, we'll even lick your feet Aslam... skip the nonsense You hear that? You do? Go away, get lost You hear that? You do? Go away, get lost There's no friend here. There's only a jilted lover... who has gone mad for his Juliet A Juliet who doesn't care two hoots for him Very soon, that Juliet will marry someone else and cock a snook at him Why're you talking to them? Talk to me What will I say to you? What? Are you worth talking to at all? You want to hit me...? - Don't show off your body Hit me! You hit me...? She's marrying someone else, you say? She'll marry and go away! You think I'll let her do that? Say it again... You're my friend and you curse me! Lay off! Hit me! Nirjara's not around! So why you have stopped? For you, sir chander, my sorry I'm sorry, buddy You were the one who told me to give up fights and brawls... and become a good boy I made a mistake Listen... at least look at me What is it? You've softened so soon. I wish you were Nirjara Not Nirjara again! Why don't you forget her? What can I do? I do my best to forget her, but I can't I feel as if... I've bequeathed my life in her name "In your name..." "in your name..." "in your name, I have bequeathed my entire life" "My entire life, my love" "I love you so dearly..." "you are my romance, my love" "What state has love brought you to?" "Even rose-gardens appear to be the wastelands to me..." "my loved ones appear to be strangers to me" "I'm forever lost in your memories..." "people call me mad and craZy" "Without you..." "without you, life is impossible to spend, my love" "Love, I can't be rid of..." "the bond of love cannot be broken" "In the tears that flow from my eyes..." "I saw you even among the Moon and the stars" "I have burnt in the fires of separation..." "yours is the name my heart chants every moment" "For you, only for you..." "for you, I shall bear every tyranny in the world, my love" "In your name, I have bequeathed my entire life" "My entire life, my love" "In your name..." I find it very tough, Lord I can't even breathe properly nowadays Please do me a favour Give me the strength to forget her I'm not sparing you guys! You hide the good-looking one and give me the old hag! You think I'm drunk? Let me go! Let go of my hand! - This one's pretty! Oh yes! Help! - Where are you going? Leave her alone! Who are you? Who the hell are you? Wait here! What filth are you spreading by starting a brothel here! Radhe, that chap was teasing a girl near the brothel He hit me! Go on No, not him What is it? Hello Listen I've been waiting for a long time. Have you brought my money? That man who brought me here said I'd be given 200,000 rupees When you go to your in-laws, you'll get the money there Spread out in all the directions It's my in-laws I've got to pay the money to Please ask them to hurry. I've got to go home Please give me my money. - You seem to come from a nice family But you're a whore. You ought to be ashamed What did you say? You talk rubbish with me...? I'll slit your tongue! You're not doing me a favour by giving me the money! You're going to collect interest! But I don't want your money anymore! I'm going home! - Wait You're not going home If you step out of this place, you'll go to the cop-house What do you mean? - Look This is a brothel the police have raided God! Where have I landed? Throw them in the jeep! Sit down I raised my hand at you. Please forgive me What's your husband's name? Where does he work? His name is Atmaram. He works at the Public Works Department I'm asking for the file, can't you see? It's right there. Go and get it Well? What is it? Who are you? What are you doing? Listen to me... What the hell are you doing? Why won't you listen to me? Sharmaji... My glasses? Why're you slapping me? If you raise your hand, I'll give you a thrashing Enough! Stop it... What mistake have I made? Why're you hitting me? My hands did the talking. Now I'll explain Go and bring your wife back tomorrow morning Else, you'll get four slaps at breakfast and eight at dinner. Okay? If you don't treat her well, I'll have to visit you again Ponytail... what are you doing here? Do you know that man, Radhe-ji? - No, but that makes no difference Brother-in-law...? Sister, your husband is here with Rahul What happened to you? Nothing... it's just... Mummy... - Rahul! My son! Mamta, pack your bags. I'm here to take you back But the money hasn't been... - I don't want any money Forget all that and just come with me Nirjara, listen to me for a minute. - I have nothing to discuss with you What you think about me is not true... - Why are you bothering me? I don't want to listen to anything. Not a minute, not five... not today, not tomorrow, not ever! You hear that? And don't you dare follow me! You tease girls in the temple? What is your name? Where do you live? Tell us your name! The name is Radhe. - Forgive me She went in that direction, you'll go in the other You offered the oil? - Yes It's thanks to Him that my sister has settled down gain No, Nirjara. Mamta has settled down again not because of Him... she has settled down thanks to Radhe Your sister had landed in a brothel in trying to raise a loan Had Radhe not got there at the nick of the time... I don't know what calamity would have struck her Mamta herself told me about it He's the one who brought your brother-in-law to his senses Which is why he quietly came and took Mamta back to his house Radhe didn't even know that Mamta is your sister Just think. When a man, without any self-interest... helps save another person's family, is he a bad human being? Yes, I admit he's a bit hard and wayward For that matter, even God lives in idols of stone But don't we worship Him? The truth is that he loves you very much True love Think about it. Did he ever misbehave with you? Did he ever try to take advantage of you? He hasn't even touched you You must be wondering why I'm telling you all this It's because I've realised... he's a far better human being than me Better than you, better than me, better than thousands of others He can even lay down his life for you Which is why Radhe Mohan is your true companion for life Not me Take a look at me! Have you ever seen me like this? I used to be so happy! But ever since I've fallen in love with you... it seems as if my bad times have begun I thought people who gave up their lives for their love, were such fools But now I realise, why they do it Rather than suffer like me, they get their freedom in moments! But you needn't worry. I'm not dying Because, if I die... you will become a widow And I can't bear to see you being widowed The truth is... Enough! Enough! I feel like... Now look, Nirjara... I don't want to rape you I only want two minutes from you I want you to hear how I feel. That's it I want you to be happy. And smiling You get what I'm saying? Everyone in the world falls in love Am I the only one without a right to love someone... to have someone love me? Well? We'll treat you like a queen I, my brother, my sister-in-law, Binti... and all my friends... That boy your father has chosen for you... I'm not saying he's not a good guy. He must be a nice chap Start calling him your brother. Or make a friend out of him I'll accept your friend I want to give the priest's daughter a nice life... and that priest wants to snatch my life from me? As if he's the priest, and I'm an untouchable! What future will you have with him? When I think of it, about you and him... it sends my head reeling. Like this! After listening to all this, you must surely realise... how dearly I love you? If you still don't get it, I... I know what I'll do! Go away! Go away! Go away, else I'll kill you. Go! But what will I do with my life then? I don't want to live a moment without you Yes! I have forcibly brought you here! And yes, I'm indeed screaming at you! I'm threatening you! That's only because... it's because I love you very much Because I think you were made only for me... only for me You were born for me alone Ask your God! Ask Him! I'm going through so much of pain... so much of misery, God! Forgive me Do please forgive me "I've draped the scarf... I dance for you" "I drape the scarf and dance..." "for I have lost my heart" "I've fallen in love with you, I've lost my heart to you" "Your love gives me a high... I've lost my heart to you" "I've fallen in love with you, I've lost my heart to you" "I dance, I break every promise..." "Every promise, I break and dance today..." "My bangles speak, my anklets say..." "come with the bridal palanquin and take me away, my love" "With henna on my palms..." "bridal vermillion on my forehead..." "I'll dress up only for you, my love" "The Spring of my beauty is here... for I have lost my heart to you" "I drape the scarf today and dance for you" "In your name I shall bequeath..." "this story of my realisation" "If we are to unite, we shall unite..." "not to be separated for ages" "I have waited for years, my love" "Even in pining I found succour, my love" "I've lost my heart to you" "I've fallen in love with you, my heart is no longer mine" "Every promise, I break and dance today..." So you're going to make us shut down our business? You ought to have kept your bullying ways to your college Get up Nirjara, how can you go on like this? I want to meet him once. - What for? Why're you unnecessarily bothering yourself? You don't understand, Indu. - I understand everything But is there any point in all this anymore? The sooner you get him out of your mind the better You understand? Let's go now. C'mon Get an injection! Quick! Where has he gone? He has survived But neither can he understand anything nor recognise anyone It's really very sad but every effort of ours... to bring about an improvement in Radhe's condition, has failed That's exactly why I wish to say something to you folks Of course. Please go ahead Although I'm a doctor, I still believe in God Whenever I fall sick... my mother gives me oblations before any other medicines It has to do with devotion, it defies logic Because prayers and medicines are both very important in our society Absolutely I was going to suggest something of the sort You must've heard of Sripurdham? Although medical science does not believe in it... Swami Sheelbhadra uses ancient cures to heal patients If medical science does not believe it, why must you believe it? Do you know? Patients are bound in chains and treated worse than animals And you want to send Radhe there? - That's because... in a fit of violence, they shouldn't hurt themselves or anyone else Whatever this boy just said is not wrong But it's also true that several patients like Radhe have been cured there It has to do with faith and devotion You either have it, or you don't Where is Sripurdham? Just telephone them Their workers will come and personally take Radhe away What are you thinking of doing? What can we think of, Aslam? We'll have to send him there You take just about anyone's advise seriously! He spoke in our own interests. - Really? And what was that? To not take your brother back home? To hand him over to some craZy ascetic? So that he can try his mumbo-jumbo on him...? Even if it leaves your brother dead? - Aslam! The doctor's trying to save his neck... and these folks don't want anyone to be a burden on them If your brother is such a burden, don't take him home! I'll take him away. I'll look after him, I'll nurse him! But I'm not letting you send him to some ascetic's ashram! Let me tell you that. And you better listen to me! Insolent! I'm the one who has pampered these boys. It's my fault! Else, could anyone misbehave with you...? Gayatri, calm down He's upset because he loves Radhe so much Go and sit there Let him go. Maybe it's good for Radhe Look at me, Aslam I can't say whether I have understood Radhe But one thing I'm proud of... he has friends like you Forgive me, brother You know why I'm sending you to Sripurdham? Because I'm fed up of you! That's it! I'm sick of your fights and brawls I'm tired of reasoning with you! I now want you to get out of my sight... so I can breathe easily! Do you hear that? What are you doing? Look... I've been scolding him. And he doesn't even talk back Radhe... I'll sit with you at the station henceforth We'll sit outside the college. We'll act like bullies... I'll join you too Just get well... please get well Get well, please Sister-in-law... the van has arrived to take Radhe away "Why does this happen in love?" "Why does loyalty..." "not beget loyalty?" "Why are good wishes..." "not answered with good wishes?" "Why is happiness..." "not reciprocated with joy?" "What does this happen in love?" "Love makes you weep..." "it makes you forget the world" "It makes you pine, it makes you restless" "What has love turned people into?" "They met their beloveds..." "and separated" "All they got was misery even in Spring..." "their lifetimes being spent, waiting for their beloveds" "Why doesn't a smile beget a smile?" "Why isn't loyalty greeted with loyalty?" "Time never comes to a standstill..." "you do not keep vigil on friends" "When medicines cease to heal..." "what does one do?" "Why isn'tjoy greeted with joy?" "Why isn't loyalty paid back with loyalty?" Chander... no one's telling me how Radhe is. Where have they taken him? But you surely know? - Girls are not allowed there But Radhe will be all right Don't worry I've put in a word to God and He too has told me... that Radhe will be all right Praise the Lord... See how ardently she is praying, Rameshwar I wonder who's ill Has she had something to eat? - No She's been praying since this morning. - This morning? Yes, a boy in her college is... - Is...? He's lying in the ashram at Sripur This girl is just like her mother She's been fasting and praying for a stranger He's no stranger, Guruji. - No...? That boy belongs to Nirjara's college and Nirjara... Yes? Go on. - She's in love with him Nirjara, is what Rameshwar saying... true? Yes, father Lord! I've committed no sin, father. I've done nothing wrong What is this if not wrong? Maybe that boy has done us favours He has helped your sister settle down again But will you entrust yourself to him for that? I already have, father I've given him my heart And my heart isn't outside my body How can you afford to be so disheartened? I wasn't ever polite with him Don't worry He... he'll return soon Our Radhe will return. Just you see Swamiji... Swamiji...! Rameshwarji... Rameshwarji... Who is it? Rameshwarji... please take me to Radhe. Just once I'll remain indebted to you all my life All right, we'll leave in the morning Mahantji... Nirjara has gone to Sripurdham with Rameshwar A boy from his college has been admitted there She said she would return by nightfall Here are the keys to your house The priest is here to meet you. - Priest? Yes, Nirjara's father You've seen what state he's in, haven't you? Do you think we didn't want to have a daughter-in-law like you? But perhaps that is not possible anymore Had my brother been all right... I'd have begged your father for your hand But to think of him now and to hope that he... it's futile. It's over. It's all over The things man thinks of doing... and what turns out to be It isn't right to think only of your happiness and cause anguish to others You know, your father has thought of nothing but your welfare He's the father who has given you life You mustn't be obstinate and drive him to death Give him his due, please When is it auspicious to hold the wedding, holy sir? Friday, July 10 is an auspicious date for the wedding It's all over. Looks like Nirjara is going to be married to Rameshwar Why're you hitting him? - He always talks nonsense! Radhe's not yet dead. He's just ill Wait and see. He'll come back as soon as he gets well And when will that be? When? After the marriage is over? No, he'll come soon I have a feeling he's coming back soon Where are you going? Get back there "Even in death, we shall not break our promise" "We will never part from each other" "Ours is a relationship spanning many births" "Who has ever separated life from the body?" "Without you..." "without you, this ocean has no shore, my love" "In your name, I have bequeathed my entire life, my love" "My entire life, my love"
