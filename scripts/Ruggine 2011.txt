All women do here is have kids and bottle tomatoes. You'll never be like that. How then? I don't know. Don't stick your tongue in my mouth. Why have you closed your eyes? Are you scared? Do you get the shivers too? They're nice shivers. Cinzia, did I do something wrong? She was naked under the sheet? Shall we go? "Red light, green light..." You all moved. - Me too? - Yeah. "I have a daughter, who can't play 23..." You moved. Bava, what the fuck are you doing? Go away! "Who can't play 23. One, two, three..." Are you still here? Go away! "Red light, green light." You moved! Go away! Liar. "I have a daughter who can't play 23..." One, two, three... - One, two... - Go home, southerner! Don't laugh at your brother! Well done! Find someone else to play this sissy gills' game then! Didn't you see that fucker Bava? - What was I to do, Carmine? - Stop him! Sandro, what're you doing? I'm not playing with you. - What's wrong with him? - I don't know. - Bend them a bit more. - I can do it even when they're flat. Yeah, let me see. - Paolo Pulici. - Are you making a bet? What are you doing? - I'm not betting Pulici - All or nothing. I've caught it! Michele... Do you want to see some magic? Sit down here. Watch this. Are you ready? Stay here. Leave it, it's only money. - See? - How did you do that? When you ?ick this, it pushes this one, that pushes this one, which pushes this one... but this one has nothing to stop it. Gama? What can you do? I'll push it through the table. - Through the table? - Yes. You're a magician! Amazing! Listen, let's tidy up now, then you can have a nap, because I have some work to do. Give me that money! Michele! If you don't go to sleep, Mom will be angry with me She still gets pissed off. Come on, Michele! Give me a hand, then you can take a nap. Do you want me to get shouted at? - You sleep when it's dark. - I'll pull the blinds down then. That's not fair, it has to be dark outside. Yes, dark outside. Dark outside. You can all suck my fat one. One little piggy went to market, one little piggy stayed at home... What the fuck are you doing? Carly on, I won't disturb you. Let's not disturb him, he's playing! Diego, why don't you sell lottery tickets? That too! Wouldn't you like to win a fortune? Me? I don't give a fuck about money. Of course not, you scrounge yours! - Have you paid the poverty tax? - What tax is that? I know you have, show me the receipt. I said show me the receipt! - He's roughing me up! - You're even crazier today! Let me see. Where is it? Where is it? Here we are. You even chose crappy numbers. This ticket is worth 80 million! Do you think rich people play that crappy game? No, they've already got money. See, I was right. You pay two Euros a time because you want to be rich, but if they ask you for two cents more in tax it pisses you off, but you'll spend it on the lottery. What if we win? They reckon you're more likely to get struck down by lightning, than to win on that crap. - Listen to the scientist! - Einstein! - Someone has to win. - I'll never win. And it's bad luck to win. Very bad luck! Can I have another drop? Carmine, is that Cosimo's gang? Yeah, it is. Come on, hurry! We don't have long. Come on! I'll help you. Doesn't she speak Italian? Do you understand me when I speak? Or are you kids from the ape house? Sandro, try speaking to them in your dialect. What do I ask them? Blockhead! Ask them if they're spies! - What are you doing here? - We speak Italian better than you do Get undressed! All three of you! I want to see you naked! Come on! Spoils of war! Come on! Naked. Aren't you getting undressed? No. Hold her still. Let go of me! Cinzia, aren't you coming? - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Let go of her! - Keep out of this, Cinzia. We weren't killing her. She was spying on us. Where were you? Doing homework? - Who do you think you are? - Show some respect! Well done! Fine gang you have here! I've never known anyone as stupid. - Leave her alone! - That's enough! Come on, we need a plan. We have to really piss Cosimo off this time! We'll bust his ass! Higher! Spin me round! I can't, there's not enough room. Spin me anyway, even if there's no room. It's not like the other house. Okay then. Wait. No, I can't do it. Is that okay? - Where the hell can I spin you - Not on the bed. You know what? I'm hungry. I want to eat some chicken. We'll put some butter on it. Butter's very tasty spread on the neck. I'll get a big knife and out this bit off... to make it more tender. Then I'll out this bit off to make it more tender... And then the chicken legs. Garlic! Wait, wait! You're hurting me! We have to cook the chicken now. - I need a pee. - Can't it wait? No, it can't. Careful, Rosalia! - When are the others coming? - When's Tonio coming? - I'll help you. - No, I can manage. Carmine, the secret entrance is blocked. We'll divide it up. Then if they win, we'll still have something left You're too young to smoke. Paolo Pulici. These are for Sandro. Where did Cinzia get to? - I don't know, she was behind me - What the fuck are you doing? I can't reach. Suck it, or I'll get tetanus. What are you waiting for? - Where did Cinzia get to? - Don't know, she was behind me What the fuck are you doing? Have you got a light? But go and smoke outside. Didn't you hear me? - Smoke outside. - I'll light it firsl. No, light it outside. Or the municipal police will come. Go on, outside. Call the municipal police then. They'll close this place down! Look... it was here the other day. This one. The very same one. Didn't you have something important to do today? - I did have. - You did... You do! But what would you do without me? Yes, it's easier to hang around here... - Busting people's arches. - You've busted it, all right. "Ass", not "ares". Up here in the north we say "ass". How come you're so eloquent? Did you go to Bocconi? No. - What's this Bocconi? - I don't know, I left school early. Blockheads! Blockheads! Throw it when I tell you to. Aren't your friends expecting you? You can't walk around with that bike. I wanted to go and play with the others. How will you get home afterward? Get out! Get out! Where are you, you Sicilian bastard? Blockheads! Beat it or it'll fall on top of you! Do you want me to see you out? You'll pay for this! My house is over there. My bike's broken! - Were you born here? - No, down South. Down South... where's "down South"? - I'm Dr. Boldrini. - Hello. I thought it was you. Sandro... Hello. What's wrong? You're not to go to that place. How many times do I have to tell you? You'll get hurt one of these days. Then what will we do? Your mom's always washing your stuff. Are you a little lord? We don't have an outfit for every day. Darn you! When will you grow UP 7 The stadium is cheering Zaccarelli on. Zaccarelli runs forward, Pulici takes the ball. Pulici aims, and it's a goal! Hold yourself stiff. Even stiffer! Hold your arms out like a plane. Oh God! - Wait! - No. Wait a sec. - Wait a sec. - No. Hello? Yes? Yes, good morning. Even/thtog's fine, thanks. I'll send you the translation in a day or two. Three at most. No problem, but it's an English text written by a German... No, it's okay. I've got my son here with me today. I can give you the first draft in two days. Practically the final draft. Then I only have to go through it... you'll have the final version by next week. Yes, all right. All right, I'll call you back in a couple of days, thanks. Please excuse me, thanks. - Well... - Are you crazy? Daddy was on the phone... It was an important call. No, you won't kill me. When will you grow up? Come on! Come on, I know you're pretending. I know you're pretending! You're pretending! I'll work and find myself a beautiful wife. I'll make some money and when I go back I'll find a beautiful wife. I'll work and find myself a beautiful wife. I talk like a guy from the North. I'll find a beautiful wife... And work, work... I'll make some money and when I go back home, I'll find myself a beautiful wife. I'm not a southerner, I talk like a northerner. Are we late? No, I'm early. Gennaro Baldoni... shall we let him take the exam? He's not a brainy kid, but he works hard. How's Baldoni at maths? He always does his homework. He might get low marks, but at least he tries. Right... our new colleague who teaches... - What's it called now? - Art and Design. - What's your opinion on Baldoni? - I'm new here. You know the kids better than I do. But you must have some idea, right? He seems a little reserved, shy... He should let himself go a bit more. That sometimes happens with drawing. But it doesn't mean anything. What's that supposed to mean? It's not important for the exam. I don't mind him taking it, if you don't. Fine. Are we agreed then? - Yes. - Good. Next one. Here we are... Cardulli. He lets himself go a little too much. Cardulli has me in stitches. I had to tum round the other day so he wouldn't see me laughing. A bundle of fun... I scolded him for making a din "Cardulli, what are you doing?" "Nothing, I was just explaining to Lopomo what a woman is." "Fine, let's hear it, what is a woman?" A woman ..is a man without a beard." Can you imagine? Okay, Cardulli is witty, and he's intelligent too. Except he doesn't do a thing... Not a thing! - And that's the problem. - What shall we do? I don't know, but he and English... are at war with one another, he can barely speak Italian. What do you think about Cardulli? Yes, he is a little impulsive. A little! But he's quite good at my subject, he's got technique and imagination. I think you should let him take the exam. Shall we let Cardulli take it too? - Yes, all right. - All right. Have you written that down? Right. You're early, Dr. Boldrini. I'm sorry about the mess. And the smell, I've been cooking cabbage, Dr. Boldrini. I opened the window but there's no breeze today. - Don't worry. - My daughter's in the big bed. I pulled the blind down, the sun was bothering her. The light bulb's blown, I'll roll the blind up, Dr. Boldrini. I'm sorry about the light... but I can't examine you in the dark. Have you got a fever? I took it early this morning, it was 38.5, Dr. Boldrini. Mrs. Mauriello, I know what my name is, Mrs. Mauriello. - Yes, I'm sorry, Dr... - Boldrini. Let's take her temperature again. Are you scared? Why? You mustn't be. - What's your name? - Margherita. Really? That's a lovely name. It's the name of a flower, you know? Lift your an"n Good girl. Let's take your temperature. There. That made you laugh. We'll wait a few minutes. You have to keep very still, okay? Like a statue. I'll count to three. One, two, three, hold it. Good girl, don't move She doesn't usually listen to anyone. Dr. Boldrini's very good, isn't he? I had to call the other doctor three times before he'd come out. Thank goodness you're here now, Dr. Boldrini. Thank you... Mrs. Mauriello. Here! Give me a beer. Bocconi University... Those who end up in charge, often know little about life. They have maids, their dads open bank accounts for them... They're shitheads, the rich are bastards. You're 10 cents short. - Is it here? - No. I won't drink the last inch, you can pour it back in the bottle. When I was 12 I didn't want to go to school So Dad told me to go out to work, and I did. But let me tell you something. A 12-year-old kid who's bone idle, and isn't the son of a worker from the South, but the son of a lawyer or a doctor instead... does he go and work as a mechanic, or a waiter? Well done! The second lesson of the day! Leave that. I'll tell you what happens to the rich kid. His father parks him in a private school, waits for him to calm down... and while I'm here talking to you, who hasn't got a fuckin' clue, the doctors son has a surgery, or he's a consultant. You wouldn't talk like this if you were rich. You'd be happy to send your son to a nice school, and wouldn't care less about guys like you. Yes, if I were a doctors son, I'd be touching the nurses up by now! Give me that beer. I'll use my finger... That's two inches, give me 5 cents back. There. Who will stop me... 'at that moment? I know you're pretending! I'm not pretending. You are pretending! Because I'm the black dragon! He'll attack you on the bed too. Even with a split lip, he'll never give up! You won't get away from me, you won't get away! You can hide wherever you want, I will find you. Always g He has two heads, one says: "I will find you" and the other: "Always!" "I will find you." "At the ends of the Earth." "You won't get away from me." "You won't get away from me." "Ever! Not even if you run over there." "You won't get away from me." "You won't get away from us!" I'm not very good on this side. - I have to go home. - Wait a second! - We have to finish the round. - Stay a bit longer. - Mum says I'm not well enough yet. - We'll take you on our bikes. No, I'll go on my own. Bye. I'll try again. I've caught you! I've caught you! You didn't expect hand-to-hand fighting, my knight! No, you will never have me! I didn't hear you. Are you going to surrender or not? - The ravine isn't enough! - I surrender! You surrender? You're done-for then! Down! Into the river! Knight... Oh God, I'm worn out. Be the black dragon again! - I can't. - The black dragon again. - The black dragon again. - I'll tell you what we'll do. You can be the black dragon now. I'll go and hide. Come here. You stand here. Look, put your hands like this. And no peeping. Start counting slowly. - And don't stop. - Up to 20. Higher! Go on! UP to 30! Higher! Goon! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... Carry on! Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty. Carry on! Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five... Margherita! It's terrible. Margherita... Keep hold of her. - Bava killed her. - Bava's never hurt a ?y. It must have been him! He's a pig. Let's ask Cosimo to help us capture Bava. Right then... Gargano. \Aola Gargano, aged 13. She's a rather strange girl, we know that. Her performance hasn't been as good this year Yes, she's different from the other girls, even the way she dresses. Her classmates wear fashionable clothes, whereas she's very simple, she doesn't even wear make-up Perhaps because she's pretty, and doesn't need to. Of course. She seems very mature. - Physically too. - If you say so... Can we leave Gargano to last? As you wish. Let's carry on. - Who's next? - Why leave her to last? It was only a suggestion. You didn't insist, don't worry. I didn't think it was a problem to leave her to last, but if we want to discuss it now, let's do so. What do you think then? First of all, I haven't noticed that Viola's work has suffered. She's always shown great sensibility in my subject. She's a bit of an introvert, but it's hardly a ?aw. It's not a ?aw, it's just a little strange. "A little strange" is the right word for it. You won't let her take the exam because she's strange? Let me tell you something. We went to the pool for the swimming lesson. All the girls had put their costumes on, except for her. I said: "Are you diving in fully clothed?" She went back to the changing room, and we waited. But she didn't come back, I went looking for her, but she'd gone, she'd gone back to school on her own. Perhaps we should ask ourselves why she did that. Are we expected to be psychologists now, with what they pay us? I'm not interested in how strange the students are. I'm just saying she doesn't study, so she can't sit the exam, but if you think we should, then we will. - If we're letting Cardulli take it... - Precisely! Next one then. No, forgive me... There's something wrong here. What's troubling you? You yourself said we know the kids better than you do. I'm starting to have doubts if you feel... that students' strange behaviour isn't important. Yes, because for people like you, the stranger they are... Perhaps because I'm strange too. But seeing as I'm strange, I would like to hear from my illustrious colleagues what they mean when they say Viola Gargano, aged 13, is strange. I won't let my granddaughter out now. What a terrible world we live in! What a terrible world we live in What a terrible world we live in Excuse me, doctor, you haven't got a patient with you? Come in. I was about to call you in. It's hot, isn't it? Yes. - Have a seat. - It's Sandro, doctor. He's got a bad cough. Take a deep breath. Again. Now cough. Again. Get dressed. There's nothing wrong with him. I'll prescribe him something anyway. Then this little scoundrel can go back to screwing his little friends. Sorry, I didn't catch that What did you say? What? You didn't catch that? I said Sandro can go back to playing with his little friends. You can laugh... Ma'am... What is it, doctor? It's not my fault you don't know how to bring your children up. Okay? And you keep coming here asking me to solve your problems. And don't complain when they turn into delinquents! - What's that got to do with it? - What has it got to do with it? She doesn't understand what it's got to do with it. I'll explain it next time. Goodbye. Doctor... - Goodbye. - I didn't mean... Goodbye. I didn't mean... Play... play, play, play... Play, play... Just a minute, just a minute... Come in! Take a seat. What the fuck is he doing? Just look at that idiot! It's Dr. Boldrini. He's giving a speech while he's peeing. You're stupid, it's not funny. You're always fuckin' complaining! He's crazy, but they take us to him for treatment. His trousers have fallen down! The grown-ups would never believe us. They kiss his ares, because he's a gentleman. He's talking to his car! I'm going home, or they'll worry. Let's leave this jerk on his own here. Do you know what the doctor did the other day? He told Mom there was nothing wrong with me and that I could carry on screwing my friends. - What? - I didn't say it. Instead of saying "playing" he said "screwing". Mum was shocked, but instead of apologizing, he was furious. He said we're all delinquents. Bastion of the West... Hadrian's Wall now without a garrison. The barbarians are rampant. I am the only one left... to guard the border. Lonely sentry... faithful to his oath. I shouldn't be here... in the middle of these cows, who stink of fried food, in the middle of... these dirty southerners. Consultant. On the children's ward. If Hitler had won If Hitler had won there wouldn't be as many of us. If we had won, yes... Such a fine castle, ring-a-ding-a-ree. What a fine castle... ring-a-ding-a-ra. And we... will bum it. Do you want to come with me, princess? Blockheads! Blockheads! Blockheads! - Do you know what I'll do? - What? I'm not going to see those blockheads. I don't give a damn. They know where to find me. Here. It can't get any darker than midnight. Blockheads. Blockheads. Blockheads. The grown-ups would never believe us. Play... screw. Play... screw. Play... screw. I'd like my illustrious colleagues to tell me why they think Viola Gargano, aged 13, is strange. I don't like her, okay? She tells a lot lies, whopping ones too. Like what? Last year, in one of her essays, she insinuated she had received "strange attentions" from her mother's partner. Fortunately her mother denied everything. Something must have happened. Perhaps something happened, but nothing serious. It's a delicate problem to tackle. We have to assess her schoolwork... decide whether she can sit the exam and go to high school, right? If she passes... I don't give a damn what her schoolwork's like You have to be careful. Don't stray too far from the building. Don't go back to that place... What do you call it? The Castle. I don't want you to go back there. Do you understand? When will you grow UP 7 Daddy, where are you? - You're scared to touch it. - That's not true. Hold the petrol bomb then. See, you are a scared-cat! I frightened the black dragon! Michele... What's wrong? I was only playing. Did I frighten you? Darling, I'm sorry. Michele... Michelino. When will you grow UP 7 Michele... I'm not a dragon! I'm not a dragon, look at me. Come here. I'm not a dragon. I'm not a dragon. Dragons don't exist. They don't exist. I don't care about her schoolwork. But what do you mean "nothing serious"? That he only touched her butt? How dare you talk to me like that! Perhaps she deserved to be groped. What did you say? She's mature for her age. Physically too. It's not our fault she looks older than her age. So there's a table, like the Mercalli Scale, to assess the level of strange attentions? What level are we at? - I'm not talking to this idiot! - Calm down! Feminism is over, haven't you realised? If it had been a boy who was molested... it would've been different. Let's not argue at the kid's expense. She confided in me. A coup de the'tre! - Viola wasn't lying. - How do you know? I believe her. From what she said, I realised it wasn't just "strange attentions", but something much more serious. Then why didn't you say anything? I don't know. It's not easy, I was scared of making matters worse. Good decision, that's a job for social workers. You have to be careful not to kick up a fuss. We can't take the responsibility for something that's not... The grown-ups will never believe us. Play, screw. Play, screw. What did you say? Nothing. Write this down... The Art and Design teacher. Cinzia Nigro... states that the teachers of Letters and Science... are envious of Viola Gargano's stepfather. They too would like to screw this child... if only they had the guts." That's enough! - Let's calm down. - Leave it. Are you crazy? 'You can... die. Let go of me! Carmine, help! Let go of me! Carmine, help! Let me go! Let me go! Why? Little ?ower... Go on. Why's Rosalia not come out? She's over there! Where's Boldrini's car? Where's Rosalia? Where is she? Where's my sister? Where is she? Everyone to the castle! Do you want to stay with me? Let her go! He's still alive. What if he survives and comes looking for us? If he survives, he won't come looking for anyone. Everyone outside! Everyone outside! Come on, outside! Come on! You bastard. Where's Carmine? Where are you going? Fancy a beer? Two? Nothing? Just as well. Since the Euro became currency, I haven't had a Lira. And I spent what I had on cigarettes and drink while I was thinking... "Shall I go see those blockheads, or not?" I was smoking and drinking... "Shall I or shan't I?" I haven't got the money. I don't have it. Do you want to kill me? Kill me then. Have you ever killed a man? One? No? This is how you do it. How old are you, Carmine? Don't you remember? Do you know how old I am? Thirty... It's not nice being in debt to someone younger. Don't worry, we don't want anything from you. Your sister Rosalia gave us the money you owed us. What's the problem? You're such a shit. I don't know why she keeps on saving your ass. Does the dragon die in the end, or not? No... now and then you'll hear its voice saying... "I'm still here." "And it never goes away again, Daddy?" That depends. Whether you're on your own or not. Above them loomed the castle silently in the night. Carmine looked at it for a second then he shrugged. "It's only iron", he said ?atly. Silently, without turning round, the children from the Alveari gang, left the scrap yard and took Rosalia home Lasers. Film s.r.l. - Rome
