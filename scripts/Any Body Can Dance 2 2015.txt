Everyone has eagerly tuned their TV sets to this amazing dance show Hum Kisise Kum Nahin! And everyone is waiting to watch their favourite team from Mumbai's Nalasopara - Mumbai Stunners! Cockroach! Cockroach! Cockroach! Is the tea hot? Quiet! Lizards... I am Raghav's uncle... Raghavji. He is my 'original', 'full time' nephew. When he was little, he used to lie down and dance. I would ask him, 'Son, what are you doing?' He would say, 'Uncle, I am dancing like a fish.' 'Fish dance!' Vernon! What can I say about him? He makes everyone laugh. He says, 'anybody can deliver a pizza.' 'But a smile... if you can deliver that... it's an accomplishment.' Vernon, keep up the good work! Vernon, we love you! All the best! - Keep it up! Vinnie! She is very cool... Not only is her style cool... she is a cool person too. She is coming on television, which is why she hasn't come to work. But her clients are waiting only for her. Suru! We call him Suru here. It's his nickname. The boys call him that. So I told him that he should do whatever his heart is set on. 'Move ahead in life. I will support you. I will give you as much money as you want.' Hey, Suru! You aren't ready as yet? Pass me that. Here. Now hurry up. And is there anything to eat? I am starving. Yes, there is an apple inside. Has everyone reached? Everyone is there. What! Vinnie is waiting for you downstairs. Get dressed quickly. Hey! Before we begin the biggest dance celebration... Let me introduce ourjudges. Ladies and gentlemen! Please welcome... Mrs. Sita Devi ji... Terrence Lewis... And Remo D'Souza! Welcome to the biggest dance show in India 'Acficflon Dee' presents... 'Hum Kisise Kum Nahin' powered by Reliance Trends. That is being watched since 12 weeks in 180 countries by millions. Let's start this programme with a breathtaking and mind blowing performance... from Team Illuminati And the next group is... J5! Where were you guys! Sorry... Come on boys! We have to win this! Let's go for it!! We have a team here... and every time they performs on this stage... they makes us realize that Indian dancers are no less than anyone! And we have here your favourite team - Mumbai Stunners! Wow! What a performance!! The audience has already given them a standing ovation. But, let's see what the judges have to say. So, let's hear it for Mumbai Stunners. Yes. The audience has given you a standing ovation Yes, absolutely! But for this amazing act... I have to congratulate... that awesome team whose name is... Philippine All Stars! Why Suresh, will you say it or should I? I think I will say it. This entire act, its every step... from the formation to the flip... has been copied! What do you have to say, Suresh? No, sir. We have not copied the act. Shut up! Not just copy, but your team has also cheated. You have written that the act is choreographed by Suresh and Vernon. But it's not even your choreography! The problem with people like you is that you pick someone else's ideas and creativity from the internet... copy it and perform the act on stage. And the poor souls who do not know... that you have copied the act... applaud and vote for you. Correct? Very sad! - Suresh, aren't you Padmashri Durgadevi's son? Yes, madam. - Whether anyone else knows this or not... but we believe that you understand very clearly that dance is no joke. It is worship. It is a discipline... A discipline your mother lived by. I cannot believe that you can do something like this. Your mother, who died with her anklets on... for whom dance was everything. Shame on you! I think you cannot continue in the competition. You guys can leave. - Tell them we didn't cheat. Sir! Think original next time. You may go. Suru... In summery breeze, flows the colour Fluttering in your warmth and affection In summery breeze, flows the colour Fluttering in your warmth and affection The colour of your tradition The colour of your love It has brought the colour of your success The colour of your tradition The colour of your love Fluttering in your warmth and affection Hi! Hi! Vinnie, I need a new haircut. Will you manage a Katrina Kaif? An exact copy. Who am I asking? You are an expert at copying, isn't it? Oh Mother... My Mother... Did your father build this place so that you could dance? Enough! No more dancing from today. From now on, you will concentrate on work. We've had to face the music as well. What happened? - We are also answerable to our families... What's wrong? I won't be a part of this group anymore! Tell me, what happened? What is it? No more, Suru. I'm sorry... Why don't you tell us what happened? WhY are you going out? Where are you going? What's the problem, boys? Pizza, sir. Good evening, sir. - Good evening... Ah, so the pizza is free today? Why would it be free, sir? Because it's late. No sir, it's just 25 minutes by my watch. Really? But according to my watch it's 35 minutes. But sir, the delivery time... This is wrong, sir. Yes, yes! Go. Sir, this is cheating. And now you will teach me what cheating is! You guys are the biggest cheaters. Listen, I will order pizza everyday. And if YOU deliver it... I will not pay a penny. Got it? You can do whatever you want. Get out. Cheaters! Did you deliver late again? Sorry, sir. I explained it to you earlier. What do you mean by sorry? Does money grow on trees? Does it? - No, sir. This is a last warning. Next time I will cut it from your salary. Oh Mother Dear Mother Hey, cheater. Sorry... waiter! Come here. Vinnie, it's your client. Come in. - Coming. My shadow dithers away from me Please get me another one. - Okay. Go! My shadow is your illusion Fluttering in your warmth and affection In summery breeze, flows the colour Fluttering in your warmth and affection The colour of your tradition The colour of your love It has brought the colour of your success The colour of your tradition The colour of your love Fluttering in your warmth and affection In summery breeze, flows the colour Fluttering in your warmth and affection "This entire act, its every step..." "from the formation to the flip..." "has been copied!" "- Your mother, who died with her anklets on..." "for whom dance was everything. Shame on you!" I have shamed you I agree I have tarnished your reputation Mother My mother I have shamed you Mother My mother You are in my soul, In my every word My stubbornness, my life You are my deepest pain, My ultimate consequence You are my holy recitation You are in my soul, In my every word My stubbornness, my life You are my deepest pain, My ultimate consequence You are my holy recitation You are in my prayer, You are my hope You are my path You are my honour, The blood in my veins You are my all, my life Fluttering in your warmth and affection In summery breeze, flows the colour Fluttering in your warmth and affection Thank you! Welcome to Comedy Nights. Let me tell you... if cheating was included in the Olympics Mumbai Stunners would surely win Gold. Bigger cheaters than us! I gave him an 80-rupee note and requested for change. He gave me two 40-rupee notes. Stop! Senses transformed Sights varied And the boat changed Altering the coast. If you want to change this world, You need to change your perspective. What you want is neither in your retreat Nor in your exile. Introspect. Everything is in your belief. A stone faced hardship And shattered to pebbles. While another stone bore adversity To become the seat of the Lord. Hello Vinnie... Suru. Let's prepare a super performance. We will rock the stage next year. Why are you worrying? Next year is very far. I have a solution right now. What is it? What is this? The biggest hip-hop competition is going to be held in Vegas.

What can we achieve there? Suru is fully prepared. The competition is in three months. We will start a new team. India's first dance team. What are you saying, Suru! In three months! Are you crazy? You are being unrealistic! In three months we'll make a team... Go to America... Look, if you guys support me... I am sure we can get there. And if you don't support me... I will take some time but I will surely make a team. Let's go. Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu!... Get lost, you fool! Dude, who are you? Idiot! He is asking me who I am? Should I tell him or show him?

Yes, you have won the bottle. Yes, so let me drink. Yes, sir. Drink up. But you mentioned the hip-hop competition in America. Ah, yes. In Las Vegas. Yes, sir. Have you gone there? I wanted to. But right now I will go home. I can drop you. I have a bike. Take me. Yes, sir. Take me. By the way, sir, we've met like in the movies. I mean you dance like Michael Jackson and have adopted Indian superstar Rajni's style. Do YOU agree? Left. I didn't tell you earlier but I have an entire team ready. Right. Right from here? Actually, sir, even I am a dancer. You may have seen me on television. Do you watch television, sir? Left. - You left TV? Anyway, I really feel that we met by fate. I mean, we needed a choreographer and you, a team. You know like... Right. Okay, sir. Yes, sir. I was saying... will you teach us, sir? Right. Yes, sir, right. So, will you take us to Vegas? Tell me, sir. Stop. Sir. Vegas. Vishnu sir! Vishnu sir... At happy hour... How was my dance? Sir, superb! I know, man. Shut up! He must be sleeping, isn't it? Try again. How can you trust someone when they are drunk? How do you know if he was saying the truth? He knows. He said that this is an annual international event since years Suru, it has been years since we have been knocking. When will he open the door? Shut up! It is the door of fortune. it will not open easily. This door isn't leading to luck, but a tippler. Hey, the door opened! Come... come... Be careful... inside. Sir. Sir? Come... come... Sir? Vishnu sir. - Vernon, check these sticky notes. OMG! - Not notes, but a whole project. International hip-hop competition. Whoa! He's mapped out everything about the competition. Looks like he's all set to conquer... The entire mission is ready. From travel details to the hotel rental. I told you. He may be a loony tippler but he is every0ne's guru. But where is this guru? Quiet. Come on. Come on. Vishnu sir. Sir. Sir. Shake him. Sir. Who is it? Hi, sir. Who are you, man? Sir, this is Vernon, Raghav, Jack... I am Vinnie and he's Suresh. Sir, you were tipsy last night. Then I paid your bill. Then on the bike - right, left, right, left... Stop. - Yes, you told me to stop like that. Have you come here to get the money? Sir, not money. You spoke about the international hip-hop competition. Sir, you told me you would show me the road to Vegas. The road to Vegas! Get out of here, go straight, then take a left. Take a taxi from the main road to the airport. Go... get lost! What do you mean? Get lost! Sir, you promised. Sir, you said that you need a group and that group is here today. I swear he said it. Suru! Vinnie, say something. Sir, we all need a choreographer... a mentor like you. Sir, please. I told you to leave. Forget being a mentor. Look at the bottle he's picked up. I do not want a team. - Sir! Sir! Sir, you are kidding, aren't you? - Maybe. Look at my face... Bubbles! Do you think I'm joking? No more teaching... Sir, have you stopped teaching dance? Sir, didn't you mention the other day... Sir? You had prepared for the competition. And that you didn't have a team You wanted to go to Vegas. Are you crazy? Whatever you may say... he's a genius. Did you see that board? He is completely prepared. Suru, is this tippler a dancer as well? Dancer? He's the king of dancers. He is excellent. I cannot tell you... He's outstanding... I mean... he s... he's just... He's praising someone else for the first time! This is unbelievable. It will be unbelievable when our feet dance to his steps. If anyone can get back our lost honour... it is Vishnu sir! What sort of a loony guy is he? He drinks shampoo. He must be downing conditioner. And honour... We will get it back when he agrees. He will agree. Leave that to me. Done. Suru... - Yes? Listen... You always make some grand plan, everyone gets excited and leave their work and come to you. But you... - But what, Vinnie? I am scared. What if there is a problem like the last time? There won't be. Do you trust me? Do you? Obviously. Come on guys... Are you angry? - Yes, sir. How was my dance that day? Sir, superb. Shut up! I know, man. Sir. Have it. Sir, Vegas. Come on, sir. Please. What kind of guy is this? What are you doing? Oh, no! What are you doing? No! No... no! Sir, the pizza is free. - Get lost. Wow!

Suru has only one dream... And he is waiting for the moment you will agree. And you are pushing him away? Why are you behaving this way, sir? Why? Because you are all cheaters. All of you. You stole the Philippine All Stars' entire routine... in Hum Kisi Se Kam Nahin. Step by Step! The entire country saw it. I recognized you immediately. I didn't tell you though. Out! Come on boys. Sir, the world gave up on us... but I thought you would give us a chance. Fine. We are cheaters. But do you know who the biggest cheater is here? Sir, it is you. We are only tricking the world. But you are cheating yourself. Your entire wall is covered with these posters... Have your dreams come true yet? I thought that like us... you too love dance. But you are only... Come on. Let's go. It is not so easy to go to Vegas. First, there will be auditions in Bangalore. Sir, we know the details. The travel, food and competition fee... adds up to about 24-25 thousand rupees... Sir, everything is arranged for. Even the team is very good. At least check us out once. 24, 25 thousand rupees will not suffice. Do you know the cost of going to Vegas? Twenty two lakhs sixty thousand. Sir, if we win the Bangalore competition... even that amount will be arranged. My boss, Shetty Anna... who owns Desi Cocktail Bar... will sponsor us. He promised us. - Yes, sir. Please sir. - Please. Only you need to agree. Say yes, sir... Say yes... Sir... sir... Please sir. Yes! Move aside. Our guru has come! - Chotu get us tea. - On Raghav's account. Wow! You guys practice here? Yes, sir. Since we were kids. It's Crocks' place. Half of it. Half? Father and uncle were partners. After father's death, I became the owner. Crooks has cut a super deal with his uncle. Uncle continues his business outside while we rehearse here every day. Sir, my deal. Yes. His deal. Alright. Call the rest. Sir...uh... Sir... We are only so many. Sir... Please sit. The championship's main event is the group event. Our team is small. It's not enough. We will need more people. Sir... don't even go there. We have been completely defamed. Sir, after the HK2N competition we... Sir... It is because of him... that half of them left... Because of me... Guys! Quiet... Guys, please stop it! Please. - Sorry, sir. We don't need a fight. We need a solution to this problem. Tell me one by one. The one holding the flag will talk. Right, sir. - Talk. The old dancers will not come back so we will need new dancers. And sir, there is one... He has the flag. We will have to hold an audition for new dancers. And for that we will have to post it to Facebook. And also make posters. And, Orkut. Sir, I know Bhogi. Flag. Oh, sorry. I know Bhogi. He is the best guy for posters. - I have...

Hey... sorry! Hey! Where do you think you are going? Is the audition happening here? - Yes... And who are you? From Baroda to Naroda, I'm very famous. Here's another weirdo. 'D' stands for Dharmesh. Sir. Vishnu sir. How are you? Alright. I saw on Facebook that sir is putting together a new team... Which is why I am here. Do you know Vishnu sir? Of course. He danced so well in Baroda. That's when I started dancing. Show us your moves. Let me tell you. My father is in the police force. He asked me to join the police. 30. g0 join! I don't know anything else besides dance.

We need more like him. Do you need another dancer? Yes - I have a fantastic dancer. I will bring him if you say so. Yes of course. Yes. Sir, am I in the team? Isn't this a great place, Vinod? What's up, D? Sir, this is Vinod. He's the other dancer that I mentioned. He's the guy. Hi, Vinod. I am Vishnu. Sir, he is mute and hearing impaired. - Hi! What? D, what are you saying? Yes... it's true. Sir, he is mute and hearing impaired. In our words, he doesn't speaker nor a mike. If he cannot hear... how will he dance to the beat? One chance. Sorry, but we need a dancer. All this will not do. Sir, just watch him once. He will manage. Sir, he is saying that he wants to dance. I can dance... ...so what if I cannot hear the music. But, sir. He says that he can... feel the music. If you can... feel the music... then... Any Body Can Dance. - Sir, he's very good. - We could take him. - We maybe be in trouble if we take him. - Boys! Are you still discussing Vinod? He dances better than all of us. Yes. We will have to take him, sir. What say? We will have to take him. Guys! Don't mind but he is like a live version of a silent film. He is a film without a soundtrack. How long will we tolerate it? Look, it is fine till this point. If anything gets messed up in the big competition... then he will not take any responsibility. What will we do then? Why are you being negative? - Why are you saying that? Then who will take responsibility? I will. In that case so will I. Me, too. I am in, boss. That's it, Jacky boy. Sir, give us your final decision. He is already in. Yay! Five... six... seven... eight. One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight. - What were you saying? - This one... - Vernon, let's try that step. - No, this one. Is this the one? Is there place in the team? There was always place for you guys. It's good you guys are back. Thank you, lord! Get me the deodorant. Get him out of here. What's wrong? - What a shameless guy! Well done, boys! Sir, let's do it once more. Take rest. Sir, please... Hey, Vinnie! Come on guys... Once more... - No more... enough... What's wrong with you guys? Sit. I'm not coming. How much will we practice? - Relax. Come. Or I'm going to dance on my own. You go dance with her. Go on. Listen, my love Pour the ink of love on me I will take on the colour I will rain on you I am only yours Your touch makes me come alive Come alive Superb! - It's not over yet. Wait! I'm not practicing... - You are going nowhere! Hold on, D. Suru, watch this. I am like sand You are the source for water You complete me I am like sand You are the source for water You complete me I will cross the ocean With this love of yours I will blossom I am only yours Your touch makes me come alive Come alive Listen, my love Pour the ink of love on me The Bangalore audition money? Wait. I will also give you. Why? You have my share? Who gave it to you? Boyfriend? Who is my boyfriend? Suru? Who told you? I am mute and hearing impaired. I am not blind. You are seeing a bit too much. Five... six... seven... eight... Turn around! There are just two more days to the Bangalore Competition. Come on. Vinnie, you go! Strong... hold firm! Back straight. Suru, follow me. Well done, boys! Keep it strong. It's becoming loose. Five... six... seven... eight... Is this what you are going to do at the competition? Make some space for me. We don't dance this much in my hometown. We danced a lot. Pass the water. Where's the deodorant? Why don't you wash your socks? What happened? Hey listen, everyone is waiting. Why are you standing alone and getting sentimental? What are you thinking about? I'm thinking about the Bangalore competition. Who knows what will happen tomorrow. Once more... once more. Come on, boys. The next round, D-Maniacs... Look at them... cheaters! Wonder who they will copy next. We just have a small problem. I'll be back. Excuse me, guys. Suresh... Yes? Mumbai Stunners! - Yes. You are quite famous. Take your group and go back. You guys are disqualified. Why are we disqualified, sir? - Excuse me! Disqualified? Even before the performance? On what grounds? The organisers can disqualify any team before their performance. Yes. But there should be a valid reason. Who are you? Vishnu. Mr. Vishnu... This is not a reality show for TRPs. This is a serious, very serious dance competition. The audience here has some of India's best hip-hop dancers... who do not want to see your team. The team that wins here will represent India in Vegas. And cheaters can't represent India. Sir, we are not cheaters... We will refund your entry fee. You guys can leave. Sir, give us one chance. Please! Vishnu sir... - Please tell them. Nothing's wrong. The team that wins today will go to Vegas! The teams that made it to the finals are... Desi Tigers, Dancing Parrots, D'Maniac... Red Hustle... and Frequency. Now let's get them on stage. Cheaters! Cheaters! Cheaters! Excuse me. Please. Give us a minute. Just one minute, please. I am Vishnu. I have got a team here from Mumbai. Whose name is... Cheaters! Cheaters, go home! Yes. You were saying this outside as well. You are right. I am happy that the audience... sitting here is honest. Yes, some of the dancers in our team have cheated earlier. They must be punished for it. And they have been. They were disqualified. Remember? You only saw that they had copied the steps. But no one saw... how brilliant their performance was. Everyone makes mistakes. But life is all about... a second chance. I request you, that if you have ever given yourself a second chance... please do so with the Stunners as well. Because they are the Indian Stunners... not Mumbai Stunners. My team. Give them one chance. After that, if you like, you can show them the door. But please... give them a chance. Know this, fate has strewn Thorns in my path But I am stubborn I will race ahead of my fate You cannot stop me Knock me down, I will get up Break the cage and spread my wings Give it all your might but I will bear it with a smile, won't bow down my head Know this, fate has strewn Thorns in my path Knock me down, I will get up As much fire as the deserts hold Furious is the blood In my veins, but still Ashes suffice for the faithful My silence is enough for me. I have been silenced for so long innocently, I have been bearing it. I have been silenced for so long innocently, I have been bearing it. Know this, fate has strewn Thorns in my path There are a hundred questions There are a hundred insults My name bears the burden of stains With the ashes Burnt by a million dreams These tearless eyes Bear the last string of hope We were not given another chance Or forgiveness How much more do we need to suffer? I have been silenced for so long innocently, I have been bearing it. I have been silenced for so long innocently, I have been bearing it. Know this, fate has strewn Thorns in my path But I am stubborn I will race ahead of my fate You cannot stop me Knock me down, I will get up Break the cage and spread my wings Give it all your might but I will bear it with a smile, won't bow down my head Vegas! Vegas! See what the bill is. What do you think? I look like a fool? I am asking them... whether I look like a fool that... he is asking for twenty five lakhs? What should I do? Anna, are you joking? I trusted you... Am I joking? Or are you? I agree that you are like family. You come and party here with your friends after you finish your duty. I have never said anything. - No... I... Whenever you have wanted an advance twenty - fifty thousand... I have given it to you... So that you can go have fun. But today you asked me... 'Uncle Harish, I want twenty five lakhs!' Is that a piece of cake? Anna, you had promised. In trusting you, I told everyone... Then you should break the promise. It's that simple. It's not the word of someone great. It's waiter Suresh's promise. Break it with a crack. Anna, we have worked very hard. We won in Bangalore. And even if we come third in Vegas... I will give back your money upon my return... Anna, I promise. Anna, this is wrong. I trusted you and told everyone... This word 'trust' is irritating me. It is firing me up. What trust? You've become very sad. Listen, I will explain to you. If you are going to Vegas for this girl... Don't you say anything about Vinnie... Listen to me... it's not worth it. It's better to go to our local Madh Island... Twenty five hundred will suffice. Yes? I told you not to talk about Vinnie like that. Suru, let him be. Suru, leave him. Come on. Let it go... Let's go... You are my own. Take him away. - Cheater! Go home! Going to Vegas? Come. - Get out of here. Suru. Let it be. He has gone mad. If you don't want to give the money, then don't. Don't you talk rubbish about the girl. Come on, Suru. I will break apart the entire place. - I will send you to the police station. - Call them. Stop it! Please. They will take you. You can dance there. Now the money won't come from there at all. What shall we do? It's over. After all this effort... we've been reduced from a passport to a ration card. Don't get started again, Raghav. - Okay. Let's go to Vegas. It is important for me to go to go to Vegas, too. But not at the cost of her honour. - Suru, look... ls Vegas cancelled? Sorry, sir. Give me an answer... You said that you would get the money. I did. - Yes? Yes, I did. - Tell me... Sir, it is not Suru's fault. Shetty Anna didn't keep his word... Sir. - Sir... You idiot! You wasted so much of my time. Sir, please. Please, sir. Sir, sorry. Please, sir. - I am sorry. Sorry. It is my fault. Vishnu sir. We have managed only three lakhs twenty thousand. Shall I take a loan from aunt Ashima. Or should I sell my bike. Hey guys! Where do you want to take the ferry to Vegas from? From Versova or from Madh? What are you saying? Why are you upset? Don't you want to go? Cockroach, where did you get this money? Yes. Vishnu sir. Vishnu sir has given it? Vishnu sir hasn't given it. I took an idea from Vishnu sir... thought about it and took the money from my uncle. Vishnu... What is the need to sell this place? You sold your land for us? Do I need the place for my burial? We will win and come back. Thank you. Suru. What did you think? That I could not think because I was angry? Guys, get ready for Vegas? Yes, sir! Yes, it is done. The visas are done and we have the money for the ticket as well. I am coming to America. Today is the best day of my life. Best. Best. Best. Yes! America. Vegas. Happy. Happy, happy- Vinod, I have been trying since eight years. It has come true now. I will make my dream come true. You think Suresh and Vernon found me? I found them. Come, sit. I will tell you everything. Who will you tell anyway... I don't care what you guys do once you get to Vegas. But I have my plans laid out. I was there when Suresh was planning Vegas. I met him. Repeatedly. I impressed him. I impressed all of you and became your guru. And now finally, my plan is about to take off! Vegas, I'm on my way! Stop! Stop! You, you, you! Step aside. Really? A hip-hop show. Is this yours? Oh, what do we have here? Do you have a prescription for this, sir? Hold on. No prescription. No medicine. Sorry. Hey...

We will rehearse. Be quiet. Are you crazy! No. Guys, you are in Vegas. Everyone knows what an amazing place this is. So, whatever you want to do, do it. I don't ask you and you don't ask me where I was. You are our God! This heart has been saved A hundred times The heart has escaped A hundred times We forgot the world After finding love! There is me and you, the way To the heart is through itself But this feeling is a little new Know this! There is me and you Why do you ask, 'What to do?' The fun starts now Dance away!

I've seen many enthusiastic dancers... but not one more enthusiastic than her. What does she eat? Don't you guys want to rehearse? - No... Vinnie, we have practiced nearly fifteen times. The boys are very tired. Please. And Vishnu sir had said that we do not have to rehearse so many times. But why are rehearsals a problem? Rehearsing too much could cause injuries. Exactly, sir. The number one reason for injuries during competitions, is fatigue. In the excitement of being in a new place... you have forgotten that your body needs rest. That is why I told you, no rehearsals. Someone take control of Vinnie! Got that? We had carried so much money from Mumbai. Now, there's barely anything. If luck was on our side, it would have doubled. This is the team's money, idiots! Vishnu sir is here. Sir... Please keep the money with you. The boys are up to a lot of mischief since yesterday. They will spend it all. It is your responsibility from now on. Please... Come on. Let's go! I think we will have to practice in that area. Oh! Philippines... Boys, Philippine All Stars. Let's go meet them. Sir, I love you... I love your dance! Wait... What's wrong with you? Suru. Guys, what happened? Okay. Hold it. Guys... I am sorry. - Go. Yes, I have the money. They have moved to the qualifying round. Such great teams from all over the world have come here. I am worried. If they don't qualify... then along with them... even I will have to go back to India. Ladies and Gentlemen... Welcome to Las Vegas, Nevada.

What happened? Are you okay'? - Sum... Is it hurting? D... Call Vishnu sir. Tell him that Vinnie is hurt and to come to the hospital quickly. I've run out credits, can I use your phone? Here. Nevada Hills Hospital. Hurry UP- Vinnie... Hi, Vinnie. - Hi! Sir, is she okay? Yes. Well, I have checked Vinnie's scan. She has a stretched deltoid... and an out of line femur. Doctor, has she broken a bone? No. No. The bone has not broken. Thank God! So can we take her home? By all means. But she needs rice... Rice. I told you to eat rice. She was not eating rice. Sir, she doesn't eat rice, only flatbreads. No. Not that rice. R-I-C-E. Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. You understand? Yes. Can she dance? No. I am afraid not. She needs rest for at least a week. One... One week! Okay. Here is her file. Don't worry, she will be fine. Don't worry, my dear. You'll be fine. Thank you, sir. - That's okay. I'm sorry, Suru... No need to apologize. There's nothing wrong with you. You'll be alright... It's my fault... Vishnu sir told us not to rehearse so much and I got over-excited... I'm really sorry! I'm in the centre of our next act... Now what will we do? Listen... don't get worked up... we'll make some changes in the routine... We'll do something... - Have you lost it? We'll lose a lot of time doing this... Suru, we'll need to find a replacement for her. And how do we do that? We are in Vegas! We need an Indian dancer... here and now... Where will we find someone now? We'll get... - From where? We will surely... Who knew Vernon is this clever... Vernon, where are you taking us? Come! Say where pal? Tell me how it's gonna be? You will want to! Dance buddy Do you wanna be with me?

I'm good. Hey, sorry to call you so fast... but you said it was urgent. Yes it's urgent... this is my team. Hey guys! Let me tell her... He says that you dance very well. Very well. Engfish. - I have to speak to her in English? You dance very... Good. - Goodly. Good... Ah! Thank you very much. You dance very well, too. Oh, thank you. And Vinnie? Where is Vinnie? You know Vinnie as well? Come on. Everyone knows you guys. You guys are the Indian Stunners, right? I know. Did you hear that, buddy? Yes. But maybe you don't know that Vinnie has recently injured herself. What? We need your help, Olive. So, this is where we kind of rehearse. Wow! It's huge. Boys, this is Olive. We've got the permissions. And now she's in our team. Any questions? This is Vinnie... That's Jack. This is Pawan - How are you? Everyone say 'hi'! This is so bad. You are hurt so badly. Guys, this is great! What are you saying, Vinnie? Look at your leg. Vernon, it is great. If she hadn't hurt herself how would a great dancer like Olive have joined our group? I guess - Really! That's so mean. Olive, don't listen to him. He is talking rubbish. - Seriously. Anyway. Where is Vishnu sir? I haven't seen him after the qualifiers. I will look for him. Vernon, you will have to teach Olive. You wait. Yes. The choreography. I need to learn this. Yes, we will. D, you go. Raghav, you too. Tell him we are at rehearsals and to come quickly. Go quickly. Boys, hurry up. Raghav, that way. Five and six... - Boys! Guys, guys, guys. We are doomed. Vishnu sir is nowhere to be seen. He has even checked out of the hotel. All the money is also with him. What do you mean? I mean he is a thief. You took the money from me to give to him. I told you, don't trust this man. Did you guy check properly near the bed and... He just told you, he has checked out... He is nowhere. There is nothing. All the money, everything is gone. My uncle will kill me. He had given the money with a lot of difficulty. The competition is still to come, Suru. Think of something. - He took a bag... He left with the money. The entire competition is still ahead of us. We have nothing in our pockets. What will we do now? We cannot do anything. - What should we do? Now what? Pick up your bags and let's go. Boys... - Nothing can be done now. We are done with the competition. Boys... - What will we do? Yes, let's go... Let's go. Hurry up. Pack your bags. - Suru... Vinnie, pack up. Let's go. Why did you come here? Why? For the competition. - "For the competition... competition..." And why did you come? Why did we come, Vernon? You have been a background dancer for the last ten years in India. And you? You cannot speak... why did you come here? To Vegas... Why? Forhonoun And you, D? Why did you come here? You were so popular in Gujarat. Young kids used to learn from you, isn't it? Why are you teaching kids hip-hop? Why are you wasting their time? Just so that we can show everyone... back home that we are thieves? Previously when we were the Mumbai Stunners... They told us that we had copied... But now we are the Indian Stunners. Indian Stunners... We represent India. If the choreographer leaves if one person leaves, is the group over? Is Indian Stunners over? Let everyone hear it. Let them all know too, the Philippines... and English team see that Indians are thieves... Is that what you want to show? Say it. Let me hear it. I am here in front of you, right? Vernon is here, too. Each one of us is here to dance. We want to dance. We dance to express, not to impress. We've not come here for money. So just dance. Don't worry about the money. We will deal with everything later. We came here to dance and dance, we will. Yes. - Come on, boys. Let's take it from the top, Vernon. - Come on. Five... six... seven... eight... One and two... three and four... Five and six... seven and eight... Bring her down carefully. Very good. Good job! Very good, Olive! Superb! - Vernon, it is good. Can you give me some water. Vernon, that can be bettered. - Sum... Sit here for a minute please. - What is it? I hope you realize that you have persuaded them again. I know. But if I wouldn't have said all that... our team wouldn't have reached here. But money is so important at this point. If we don't have the money after the performance... what will we do? Vishnu... Hi, Swati. Have a seat. Did you come to America for some work? Swati, it has taken me eight years to get here. You have no idea what all I have gone through in these eight years, Swati. I have only come... to meet my son Manu. What will you accomplish by meeting Manu now? Isn't it a little too late? I am married now. Manu has a father who loves him a lot. He is a normal man... who has a normal job. He goes to the office. He has the weekends off and takes his family out. He is a normal guy. He looks after us... He is not a struggling choreographer who is always on the lookout for his next job. You understand? Vishnu, relationships are made and broken. I have moved on. So should you. I know... but... Our relationship can break. But not Manu's and mine. You live your life. Be happy. No problem. But please let me meet Manu once. I don't think it is a good idea. I think you should leave now. Please Swati. I am sorry. Hey, mom. Hey, you are Vishnu. Aren't you? Oh, hello, Vishnu sir. Mom, you know him? You know him? Of course I know him. He is Vishnu. Vishnu sir. Where is your phone? Yes. Here... Hey... This is you, right? Yes! I knew it. Mom... You like hip-hop? Of course. I love hip-hop. I even saw your Bangalore act on YouTube. It was fab! Mom, do you know that Vishnu sir's team... is the first Indian team... that has qualified for the semi finals in Las Vegas? Yes, it's been all over. Can I please have a picture with you? My friends are gonna burn! Come. - Morn, click fast. Thank you. Manu, Vishnu sir is getting late. Thank you, Vishnu sir. Bye. Mom, you know him? - Yes, he's an old friend. Vishnu sir... India will win, won't it? India has already won. Take care. Thank you, Gopi, for helping me out. Don't mention it. You have been waiting to meet Manu since the last eight years. You met him. Are you happy now? Very! Vishnu, our team... Who is she? Looks like there's been a problem. Boys, wake up. Oh sacred waters! You guys will drown in there. - Raghav, what are you doing? How much fun is this! What happened? Did this happen in the night? There's a hot water spring that feels like this in Haridwar... We just need some more time. No, you got to listen. You got to get the money together. But do you know how they've come from India? I understand that. -And I am so... I know all that, but listen... what I'm trying to tell you is that it's the rule. I got to follow them. You got to follow them. Okay? Look... You have till 12 o'clock to get the money. If you don't... you just got to go home. Sir, but we just need one chance. Stop it. You just got to pay up or go home. Okay. - I'm sorry. Okay. - Sir, please... What happened? We need to pay the money. Now! What did you say? "What have we come here to do? We have come to dance." What have we achieved with all this dancing? We are broke. Plus, we are in a fix with Vishnu sir. We trusted him with the money. We came here from there... only to sit like this? Here also... Guys, we are popular. People know we dance well. If we get a couple of days, we can raise the money. Right? That means even after working so hard we still have to beg? Beggars? We are not... that. That's not true... jeez... Of course you guys are beggars. That's why you have no employment problems. If you run out of jobs, there's always begging. Sum... - Suru... Listen... - What? Please leave us alone. I'm requesting you to leave us alone. Guys we are here to dance not to fight. Don't touch me... - Don't you touch her... You want to talk... talk to me. Suru... Suru! Please... Please guys... Move. Sorry. Please. Sorry. I was selfish. I came here... with a vested interest. For my son Manu. But because of you, I not only got my son... but also respect. Which I could have never gained by myself. I can't do anything about the family that left... but the family... that we have made now... I don't want to lose it. Sorry... Sorry. Sir, no. Please don't apologize. You are our guru. So girls... what's up? God, I love Bollywood. - Bollywood dance? I will teach you... Hi, guys. Hi, Indian Stunners. Hi, Vishnu sir. I am Pooja. - Hi! A big fan of yours and Indian Stunners. Get up. Thank you. Thank you. Actually, you don't need to introduce yourselves... I know all of you. I have been staying in America since many years. I am so happy to see you guys here. I feel so proud to be an Indian. Thank you, - Thank you. Actually, I have an Indian restaurant called Nirvana and that has the best Indian food in Vegas. I know you guys must be dying to have Indian food. Will we get Gujarati snacks there? Of course. So, why don't you come? Next time. Next time. - Yes. Oh, please let's go. Come on. Please. You like Indian food? I love Indian... Food. She likes Indian food. Sir, let's go. Please, sir. Let's go. Sir... - They might have South Indian food too. - Come on. There's never a next time.

We are going to be over there. You guys sit here... We understand... Come. - Hi! Hey! Hi! - Hi. Do you work out? Work out? - Yes? Where is the time? We rehearse from the morning until the evening... dancing... Okay. Like the saying goes... work is worship and 'Pooja' means worship. Are you okay? - Yes. Yes? - Dancing... Yes... Excuse me... Excuse me, you say you are Indian? Yes. Is your mother Indian or your father? Father... why do you ask? That is why... What do you mean, Suru? That is why you do not know how to eat. If your mother were Indian, she would have fed you with her hands. You are meant to eat with your hands. And the lentils and rice are to be mixed and eaten. You want me to put my hands in the curry? You mean, I actually need to dip my hands in the curry? Yes, put your hands in the curry. No, let me show you. Really. If you eat with your hands, you will be able to make right sized... You know... I mean... what's the w0rd...? Bite! You are smart. Bite. No, I am not doing that. Take it. - No. I am sorry. Open your mouth. Olive. Olive, just try it. If she doesn't want it, why are you forcing her? I am only feeding her. If she doesn't want it, why are you forcing her? I am not forcing her. She is a friend. Suru. What Sum'? What will you do? - What will I do? Tell me, what will you do? She bites! She's biting me! As the wind touches you I want to touch it I don't wanna go on And make castles in the sand If you walk with me The paths won't be lonely I am gonna love you Like no one ever can... How long will I be alone? You know I need you by my side! Yes! How long will I live alone? One thing I have realized... If you hold my hand My world will change If you hold my hand I will have all the joy If you hold my hand My world will blossom If you hold my hand Oh Baby! I'll never let you go. O O O You calling out for me O O O You got me on my knees If I get you I will treat you very dear Baby, I'll be there for you forever I have been saying this Time and again If I get you I will treat you very dearly Baby, I'll be there for you forever I have been saying this Time and again You don't know How I need you Like a bird that's looking for the sky I know what I am without Oh Baby! I'm just another guy! If you hold my hand My world will change If you hold my hand I will have all the joy If you hold my hand My world will blossom If you hold my hand Oh Baby! I'll never let you go. O O O You calling out for me O O O You got me on my knees O O O You calling out for me O O O You got me on my knees, for life! If you hold my hand What a super hit move. Come closer, let me see. - It's really funny. - Oh my God! Raghav has lost it. Suru. Look at this. I have shown you twice. Two... two minutes. One second. Come on, Suru. What is happening? What is happening? What are both of you doing? Who two? You and Olive. Vinnie is feeling bad. Look at her face. Vinnie is feeling bad? Vinnie? Don't do all this. Where are you taking me? Let's clear things right away. Vinnie, are you feeling bad about anything? No. Vernon is saying that... You aren't feeling bad about anything? No. When she feeds him, touches him then your face falls. Now that he is in front of you, tell him. Tell me, Vinnie. Tell him. He is just talking rubbish. What is wrong with you! Listen... you go to Olive. I am going to Olive. - Just a minute. Wait. You go. Now I should go? What are you showing her? Wait two minutes. Let me show her. Who are you showing it to? - What happened? Something personal between them. I don't know. Yes! I am feeling bad... that you two are getting close, unnecessarily. Why are you feeding her? Feeding her... We are rehearsing, so there is bound to be contact. Is this how rehearsals are done? What are you doing? Everyone's watching. Let them see! I am not in love with her. Why didn't you tell me if you have feelings for me? It is obvious to everyone. Even Vinod can see it. Why can't you? No I can't. I'm blind! Why don't you tell me? Say it. Do I... Do I need to tell you? Why are you getting worked up? You... You know that... You'll make her cry! Hey, Suru... Hold up! For the first time in the history of the World Starz hip-hop challenge... two teams have the same points but there's only one spot in the finals. This means they will be battling it out tonight in a dance off. This is huge for India as the Philippine All Stars are their idols. So, here we are finally at the face off in Las Vegas. And everybody is asking me who my favorite is. You know what... both teams are my favourite. First up, let's see what the Philippine All Stars got for us. That was amazing! Come on boys... come on. What happened? Sir, they are very good. Sir... how will we... They are like our Gods. I mean... - They are not real Gods. Now you dance for the real One. You won't dance for them but only for those, who look out for you. Come on, Suru! Do it! Let's go for it!! O Supreme Being! Without you... O Divinity I am lost O Supreme Being! Without you... O Divinity I am lost My dreams started taking shape Shattered before it came true My tasks are incomplete. Please guide me. Hail and salute you Supreme Lord The Lord known by many names The one in many forms Who wears the moon on his forehead Supreme Lord The Lord known by many names The one in many forms Who wears the moon on his forehead The creators of the universe All sing your praises Superior Lord, the sky echoes With the melodies of the percussion Oh Lord!

What are you doing? You know how to slap, don't you? Then why did you wait to be slapped four times? Why didn't you hit me back on the first one? Come. Hey! Stop. Stop. Calm down. What happened? - He slapped me. He did? - Yes. Then hit him back! Stop! Stop! Get up! Now! Stop... Stop it! Come on. Separate. Separate. Get over there. Stop! Take your breath. Everybody. I won't have this violence in my competition. You get it? I spent ten years getting this garbage out of hip-hop. We won't go back. Do you understand? Yes. Do you understand? Say, 'yes'. Yes. Your team! Your team! You have one more chance. You do it again, you are out of the competition. You boys want to show your muscle? You show it out there. Not here. Now get out of here. - Yes, sir! Now, go! Move! Boys... look our Suresh and Vernon. Indian Stunners deserve it better. This is their first time but they did super duper great. They deserve this because I know it is from their heart. Suresh? - They know what they want to do. To actually show the love for dance and hip-hop in the whole wide world. It is their first time. But... respect. Indian Stunners! Victory to India! One... two... Guys, hold on. Three... Jack, come. - Wait, where are you going? Thank you. How are you doing now? How is your foot? - Okay. Sit. It is better than before. It is better now. Thanks. Listen, Vinnie... I just didn't know... I mean, that you and Suru... I mean... were childhood friends. And I unnecessarily came in between. I am sorry I got carried away. I am the one who should apologize. Suru is like that. Everyone falls in love with him. Thanks, Vinnie. I just wanted to clear this. I was your replacement here. And now, when you get okay... before I go, I wanted to tell you everything. Before you go? Where are you going to go? We have reached here because of you. And when we move ahead in the competition, you will be with us. You are a part of Indian Stunners now. Yes. - Yes... Yes! From the disgraced copycats... to the meek underdogs. For the first time India takes part in such an international arena... and is now at the top! Making us so proud of them. I would always tell him... that he's a winner! Just do it! Move ahead!! Look at him now. Blessings to Team Indian Stunners. They defeated the same team they had copied from. Amazing! They made us proud. So, Indian Stunners... go for it! Well done Indian Stunners...

First time in the contest they go through the qualifiers... Go through the quarters... go through the semis where they had to face their inspiration... - The Philippine All Stars in a dance off! - Let's do this! And now... raring to go... Hey you!
