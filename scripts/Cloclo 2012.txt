You're going to have a little brother. - Claude, it's time! - Already? C'mon, Hassan! Hurry. Mama. Hassan, quick. Hurry, children! Come here. Let me see. You must wash your hands. Papa will be home soon. My handsome Claude! Good evening, Mr. Francois. Salam Alekum, Hassan. Good evening, Aime. Here comes Rudolph Valentino. Darling. My wife cheats on me with the King of Hearts. - Calissons! - From "Roy Rene." Straight from Aix. Barenton brought them. The children? They studied quietly in their room all afternoon. - I don't want to. - Go on. Then blue! No, it's my picture! Good evening. Did you have a nice day, sir? Very nice. Thank you, children. I warned you. Next time you'll tidy up. So, Claude. Did you practice your violin? Enough, I mean? I think so. Play for me? What do you want to hear, sir? Ismailia for Barracuda. May we line up to enter? Vessel name and cargo. How do you like the Suez Canal? What's the name of that boat? I can't see. Come over here. The first is the Liberty ship. Coming from Port Said. It goes through in 15 minutes. That big tanker's from Alexandria. It's here. It goes through in 40 minutes. When you grow up, you'll work for the Company, too. July 1956, 10 years later Egypt's sons are taking over the Canal. The Canal is on Egyptian soil. The Canal belongs to Egypt. May God guide you to success, and peace be with you. All valuables! Not my ring! Move it! Get in! Hurry up, Claude. Hassan, come with me! Take the ring, it's yours. I'll keep it next to my heart. Hide the car till our return. Aime! Captain, it's your duty to protect our homes. Look at these savages! What are you waiting for? Where will we go now? I don't know. To your sister's in Monaco. Her husband will find us a flat. We'll be back soon. It's only for a few weeks. Everything will work out. Here. Monaco, 1957 - One year later. Honestly, Claude, it's a bad idea. You know tumbas, but not snare drums... So what? What? We'll see. So long, you'll hear from us. Next. There are leftovers. Soon, no more bread and oil for us. I auditioned for the radio house band. - You? - As a drummer. And? They hired me. I'll be paid. Papa, isn't that good? And your bank internship? I'm not kidding. They hired me. How much do they pay? 500 francs. It's not much, but it'll help. I underbid to get the job. I start tomorrow. Tomorrow it's back to the bank. Jojo brought us apples. I'm just stopping by. Claude's been hired as a drummer. Want me to rot behind a teller's window? I'd rather enjoy what I do. I sweated blood and tears for your education. Your sister's married. Well married. But you need a real trade. I won't have some busker son. - But Papa... - Discussion closed! Don't. Not hungry? Well, I am, and Mama, too. So what do we do? Rely on you? You can't even hold a bar job. Get out. I know, France let you down. It's not your fault, right? I'm not ashamed of being poor, only of doing nothing to help us out. I won't give up. You go back to the bank. If you disobey, never speak to me again. Ever. Dad... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Please, trust me. Tomorrow you move out. I won't wait that long. Aime? Once I was also seventeen The world was no place for me Other kids had nothing to prove They slip right into a groove Summers at their country home The keys to dad's car Just to roam And mom's purse For an easy loan Some have it all at seventeen I was a stranger in their eyes They had Vespas, I was despised When I'd go for a swim With my dog down by the docks They'd chase me laughing Down the block I'd come home my elbows bloody You learn what courage means At seventeen That's my son! On the wide uptown avenues I saw my chances were few If I was going to make it I'd have to clench my teeth And take it Throwing stones against the wind I had a giant's dreams I became strong and lean At seventeen Dad. Your son is here. I do this for you. You lost the Company indemnity! What's left to bet? You lie. You can't be trusted. I'll win, Claude. I feel it. I'm lucky! Shall we do the accounts? Trust your Chouffa. We'll make it, you'll see. Not like that. Good evening. My name's Claude Francois. Mr. Frosio was kind enough to let me leave my beloved tumbas to sing you a song. I chose a current hit: "Don't Fool Around." Don't fool Don't fool with my heart Believe me, It's my most fragile part If you must Find solace In my laughing eyes Which see only you! So maestro, I told you it would work. Some day I'll cut a record. Sure you will, fella. Don't forget to send me one. Autographed, please. Are you all right? What's that mean? You give me hope. You sure? He gives everything rhythm. Even when the song is slow. Sinatra! American style. What class! Together! And 1, and 2, and 1, 2, 3, 4... Good! Turn! Right! And slide! What're your after? Flirting with everyone! Stop it, please. - Anybody else? - Don't start again. Janet! When my back is turned... You're hurting me! - Stop! - It's unfair to treat me like that. It's because I love you madly! You scare me. Because I love you too much! I love you too much. I'm sorry. I have a right to have fun too. Think I'm going to wait around like a puppy? I love you. Say you love me, Janet. Say it. I love you. And I declare you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. "Claude: I think you're terrific. "I know I'm too young for you. I'm only 13, but if..." - Let me see. - Give that back. "But please, Claude, wait for me. "Three short years "and I promise to be the best of wives." Give that back. - Give it back. - Which hand? You're crumpling it. It's all crumpled. Your first fan. No, your second after me. I'm proud of you. I wish Papa could see it. I still haven't told him I'm divorcing. And that I'd met Jerry. I'm afraid he'll be hurt. And when he finds out he's a musician... Don't worry, Jojo. It'll be okay. Is he out of the coma? Tell him I must speak to him. I really have to! March 1961. Do I look okay? You're very, very handsome. Irresistible. You'll be a smash. The chocolates, the record? Take it easy. I really talked you up. I'll dance at the Olympia, you'll cut a record. Life will be great! Let's go! Go on, Claude, it's time. Say goodbye to all my friends Friends of ours, until the end Tomorrow I'll be far from here Far from you, yes my dear Life didn't want to... Well... We can't all be born Sinatras. I'd rather be sincere. You're very nice, Claude. Jerry tells me you're a hit at Frosio's in Monte Carlo... But, sir, I don't want to stay a house musician. Sure, but your thing is... Excuse me, it's... It's completely outdated. - How old are you? - 22. You really think people your age want to hear this kind of music? Here. Go see him at the Olympia in two weeks. It'll help you see the gulf between the modern world and this. Good chocolates. He's okay, but the physique and voice are all wrong. But we can work on it. I'll help him. I saw him in Monaco. He's got something with the public. Especially with girls. He's not the only one. There are plenty of cocks on the walk. Johnny! In 10 days I'll dance here with the chorus line. Look: Brel, Vince Taylor, Dalida, Becaud. We're doing the openers. And soon, mine, too. Yes, maybe. But Claude... How long are you going to sulk? Of course I believe in you. What bugs you is my dancing at the Olumpia! Olympia! Like the De Sica movie you won't let me do. I know, Italians are lechers. None at the Olympia? Who are you thinking about? I dance because we're broke. Your band doesn't pay. I'll pester Philips every day, but I'll cut that record. While I earn our living. Good thing, seeing how you spend your money. - Excuse me? - The clinic. What about the clinic? It's an investment, Janet. Like my voice lessons. To succeed, every detail counts! Hey! Are you finished? - Where are you going? - To the toilets? May I? Don't laugh. How's my Frankenstein? Don't make me laugh. - I liked your nose. - What did I tell you? "Every detail counts." Every detail. Come in. - Claude Francois. - Again. What do I tell him? Don't act naive. You like blondie. Did he bring chocolates? These are special: 85% cacao. Fit for the gods. Your chocolates are great. Did you do something to... Yes, I had an accident... It's better. Thanks. - Did I mention I was born in Egypt? - No. What would you say to a Franco-Arab twist? This is your place, my dear Gilbert. You're at home here. What are you doing here? We're rehearsing. I'm taking you to dinner. I have great news. No kiss? Young ladies! You're never, never in time! You're never, never in time. Who does the star think he is? A star, naturally. Go and change, quick. I'm so proud of you. I told you. So what's this record called? Nabout Twist. I must call the Queen Mother in Monaco to tell her. Tell her in person tomorrow. What's the matter? Is she sick? The shame of it. This woman never keeps her word. My mother lies. She sold the Monaco flat to pay her debts. Gambling debts! I felt so alone, so very alone, you understand. You had all left. Your father is gone. Yes, so I went back to the casino. To feel less desperate. Yeah, sure. I'll never gamble again. I swear! I learned my lesson. Same old song. I have nothing left. Nothing to bet. I'm cured. Let me make it up to you. I'll help you out. I can cook, do the laundry. If it's too much for you, I'll understand. I'll find some place to sleep. Jojo and Jerry will have an apartment soon. I'll stay with them. Stop it! Cut the act, Mama. Drop your bags and shut the door. I didn't see it so... So what? So shabby! But not for long. Soon you'll earn money from your record, and you'll buy us a house, my Claudio. Listen good, baby If you want to slim down You have to dance The Nabout... Twist! The Nabout! It's the dance You now call the twist The Nabout! It's been ages that it does exist It's really something abdominal For your figure It's phenomenal The doctor said When I asked the question Nothing better for the digestion After dinner You have the occasion To lose your belly Turn off the telly What did he do now? Don't be angry with him. As a child, he had an accident in the pool. Some moron dove on him. Concussion. After that his character turned more... Anyway... But my Claude is a nice boy. True, he's jealous. Put it down to his oriental side. And his record flopped. When he'll be recognized for his talent, he'll calm down. It's your band. Will you be late tonight? I don't know. Honey, please, leave the key this time? - Where is she? - She's not here. What's going on? Nottingham - England Stop talking nonsense. I love you, Janet! Come back. We need to talk. No. The band got a summer gig on the coast. Well paid. Join me in the sun. We don't get along anymore. You know that. That's married life. We said "till death do us part," remember? I'll make an effort, I'll be careful. Come back. No. I'm coming over! I don't love you anymore. You're lying! No, it's true. How can you say that? It's rotten. You're rotten! I love someone else. I'm in love. It just happened like that. Who is it? Who? Gilbert Becaud. He can't see you now. I want to adapt it into French. Lucky Blondo is doing it. But it's for me! If you don't let me, I'm a goner. It's all very nice, but I have a meeting. Nicole, I'll be back at 2. I can feel it! Go see Lucky Blondo. Say the song's off. I know he's better known. I also know I was wrong about Nabout Twist. But believe me, if I sing this, it's a Gold Record. - How'd you convince Tilche? - I'm persuasive. And you'd argue that my lyrics are bad? They can be better. "Nothing but our love"... it doesn't sound right in French. We need words that sing. Something fuller. All right. Since you're so clever, think of something fuller, while I finish my dinner. You've eaten, I suppose? Of course. All right, show me. This is good. You're gifted. You're kind. Not always. But this... This chorus is better. I wanted a word that reminded me of bells. In French, "belle" means "beauty". Belle, belle, belle... Belle, belle, belle, You were made to love. I'm buying. I'll work on it tonight and we'll meet tomorrow. You have a stage name? No, why? American-style, like Johnny Hallyday. Claude Francois is my name. I'm proud of it. Nice going, Claude. Paul, come in. Claude, this is Paul Lederman. Paul knows the record market. He'll be your manager. I'm sure you'll get along well. Oh, what a year Those were the days I made my debut For the public I was something new Oh, what a year Rock'n' roll Was starting to cast its spell And I was singing "Belle, belle, belle" And the public cheered That was when, The Beatles were four guys... On the wing And me, My song was,"Walk Right In" Oh, what a year It was great to be teen idol no. 1 My fans created pandemonium, Oh, what memories, what a year It was yesterday, But nothing's changed today It's the same business Starting all over again That was the year... 1962! Unknown a year ago, he's now sold 2 million singles. Ladies and gentlemen: Claude Francois! Aren't they beauts? The future parents of a big family. Listen, son. Get this through your head: Now is when it gets tough. It can all be over in 6 months. - You really think so? - Of course. Most of all, I think like you do. I want what you want. If in 10 years' time I'm not Sammy Davis Jr., I'm a failure. I want to be France's top star. You can be. It takes work. More than you think. Johnny Hallyday is up for military service. So we work harder, double the gigs. Everybody clap with me! Louder! I can't hear you up there! Louder! If I had a hammer And if I had a bell And if I had a song to sing I'd be the happiest of men I would want nothing else But a hammer, A bell and a song For the love of my father, my mother, my brothers and sisters That would be true happiness It's the hammer of justice It's the bell of freedom It's the song for my father, my mother, my brothers and sisters I'd be the happiest of men That's true happiness If I had a hammer! Cloclo! Cloclo! - What's he run on? - Water. Almost. Chivas and a Coke before curtain. What a bunch of bunglers! Give the wire some slack! This guy! For Chantal... Dry this, quick. And the dryer, not too close! France Gall is back. Get moving, now. You'll tire of me. No, I'll come back tomorrow. And the next day. What do your parents say? They don't know I'm here. And when can I applaud you on stage? Please, don't come. The stage scares me so. Belle, belle, belle, You were made to love I'm a Miss France Gall fan, too. I'm sure you do fine. Lovely as you are. Everyone will be charmed. Sorry! Beat it! Sicko! Mama. See? Less than an hour from Paris. There, we'll have a pool put in. A huge one. For the yard, I found a Paris landscape gardener. I'll get animals, maybe African cranes. But with the Paris apartment, that's a lot of expense. With me, it's better than a casino jackpot. You'll spend weekends here. I'll be boss. I'll plan it all, like in Ismailia. Meals, receptions... What'll I do, the ironing? No, Jojo. You'll hold the purse strings. Mama, you'll have hired help. I'll take good care of you. And my grandchildren. First I have to find their mother. If Dad had seen this... Another little step. Careful. There're more stairs to the left. Your foot, there. If Madame would kindly sit down. For you. Like it? It's beautiful. Leave the girls alone Leave the girls alone Or else they'll be leaving you Leave the girls alone Or else you'll be crying too Look out. Watch the bodywork! Please, move back! No time! Please! Go on, Claude. - I see you here often. Your name? - Josette. Like my sister. Don't cry. Give her that. - Let's go. - See you later. Everybody will get a chance. - Tell him to remember this time. - Trust me. Thursday, Bordeaux. Friday, Mont-de-Marsan. That brass! I want it. You listening? Saturday, Biarritz, and Tuesday... Tuesday: Vegas for a photo shoot. Can't wait. You're taking the girl, right? France Gall. Yes, I know about her. Ticky... - It wasn't me. - No, it wasn't. So, what're you doing? She's not coming. But I'm mad about her. I never thought I'd fall in love again. But as soon as I see her... She's so fresh, so cheerful, she fills me... That's all very moving, but... A youth idol has to be discreet and unattached. So keep it quiet. All right, already! My prince. Wake up, Cinderella. I have to take you back to your parents'. I'm hurting so bad Knowing somebody else Is holding you You see who he means? Janet, his ex... Gilbert Becaud... I'm hurting so bad And yet, since then I've long known it I know Nice jacket! Straight from Vegas. A gift from the boss. He knows you're moving on? Nope. And I'm scared stiff. You're right to be. Hello, Claude. And congrats. Sweet of you to come. Doesn't only Johnny Hallyday have the privilege? Don't be silly. I hope that after his next record there will be money left for mine. You know that... Philips is Johnny's territory? I know. Ticky! Am I imagining it? Why only give me adaptations he turns down? You have no lack of fans. Congrats on your fan club. 50,000 members... And still growing! You're the first. That's the treatment I want. As No. 1. Like Johnny! I said, in line with my bedroom windows. Is that in line? I can see you can't see. I have to do everything! Mr. Francois, I thought... Don't think, check! - It doesn't matter. - Sure it does! Flowers are a detail. God is in the details. Don't you know? Claude, Christian is here. Send him down. - Write everything down. - Okay. Read it 20 times a day if you must. Okay. And cross things off as you go. Okay. Stop saying okay. It's annoying. Sorry. Always be nearby. Not too close, but close enough to hear me. Here. Come on. My sunglasses. Very important. Always clean. And always in their case. The case always in the bag. Got it. Lunch is ready. Come to the table. And bring your new idiot. You made moussaka! We'll continue later. You must taste my mother's moussaka. About my mother: Never lend her money, ever. She plays poker and... And about France and me, mum's the word. Got that? No one knows. It's better like that. Look. This is great! I'll record everything on British radio. Everything. And you, stay with me every minute. I can't, you know that. It's up to you. Why bother with pointless stuff? Like what? Eurovision. Just to lose. It's idiotic. Eurovision, I swear... In a few minutes we'll hear Serge Gainsbourg's excellent song, performed by France Gall, watched by 150 million TV viewers. I'm a doll made of... France, come quick, it's Claude! Claude, darling, did you see? I won! Listen to me: You won, great. But you lost me. France, a smile. What do you think of the chorus? The chorus is fine, but it's... Open up, Claude. Open up, please. My winning doesn't hurt you. You should be glad. Darling, open up! Open up, Claude! I love you so. Why are you doing this to me? My love! This is too hard to understand. Cut the false poetry. Let her in. Screw her and her Eurovision! Open up, Claude! I'm letting her in. If you do, you'll never write for me again. Keep out of this. Sit down. Let's go on. Leave her! I'll call the elevator. Come on. Simple like hello Sad as a goodbye That's what love is like You have to suffer To find happiness I hold out my arms But you leave That's what love is like It changes moods like you Who wants a photo? Move back. Take it easy. I wrote you a love letter. How sweet. I promise to read it. Didn't you write anything? Dannemois. One year later. Papa is with us now. As if he were at the Mill. Thank you, my Claudio. To the newlyweds! The same pool as Elvis has. Wrong: He has the same as me. Taha, champagne, make it fast. Think we'll marry someday and have children? - Like Johnny Hallyday and Sylvie? - I'm talking about us, not them. Don't you want some little blond-haired darlings? As pretty as you? I can't leave my husband's coffin in Monaco. Didn't you bring it here? I couldn't. Think how much it costs. Did you ask Claude? I already ask too much of him. He's so generous. For my husband, I'll manage alone. We need to have him with us. I might be able to help. How much do you need? Thank you so much! An hour and a half late! You're right, son. Warm them up. Until they burn the house down! - This jerk forgot the cookies. - You did? Why do I get the worst assistants! Where's my trailer? Show him his dressing room. Hurry. Claude, please! Step on it. I'm full throttle. Every minute of the day. What incompetents! Look at him. Jeez! What're you doing here? Sorry, they said I could change my bandage here. What happened? I twisted my ankle. I dance in the first part. - I'll leave you. - Don't go. - What's your name? - Isabelle. I'm Claude Francois. Like the singer. Sorry. Walk right in, Don't look around Don't give that girl a grin Walk right in, Sit right down That will put her in a spin She's the kind of gal All the guys are wooing But you let her know, Nothing doing Walk right in, Sit right down And you'll turn her upside-down Walk right in, Don't give her a look Wrong note, you're fired! You're not far off! Four times. The same mistake four times! Makes me sick! - I didn't do anything... - Got a problem? Is this the Salvation Army? Look at your shoes! Out! I don't want to see your stupid faces again! Don't worry. He's fired me seven times, then gave me a Cartier watch. This is it. What? I'd like you to meet me my country cousin. Virginia. Valeria. Valeria. A real fan. Don't be intimidated. This is my dressing room. I'll leave you two. Paulo went to get our cash. The cash! The cash! Burgundy for all, okay? Thanks, boss! I'll finish my story. 3 years later I go by the same store, and what do I see? The parrot, still bare! Incredible! How'd you like the show? Really want to know? You're repeating yourself. It's routine. Humdrum. 40 SRO gigs, 3 encores a night and still not happy? Cut it out. You feel like I do. Not tonight, Paul. Let me savor the moment. Is that possible this once? So sorry. I misunderstood. So it's just tourism. I thought you were settling in. Listen, son. If you don't change anything, in 6 months you're done for. A has-been. End of story. Stay, Stay here with me We need each other, Can't you see Stay, Don't abandon me You'll regret it Almost as much as me I hear the door closing on you I hear your steps Fading down the hall Suddenly I feel alone and lost I feel my head empty And a pain in my heart I know I'm not a perfect man I can't always Find the right thing to say I don't care enough for you And I'm afraid of not having love But I dream Yes, I dream I'm afraid to admit it Except when I'm alone And thinking of you Stay, Stay here with me We need each other, Can't you see Stay Please don't go You'll regret it Almost as much as me Holy cow! - Christ Almighty. - Did you see that? Extraordinary! And Blacks on French TV... That's totally new. It turned you on, you old lecher! And I designed their costumes. It was fabulous. From now on, guys will take their girls to see Cloclo and his Clodettes. - Innovation enough, Mr. 20%? - Fine, son. You were right, we can't sleep. And now what, Paulo? I've got plenty more ideas! A first in France: A singer has created his own label and music publishing house. That entertainer is Claude Francois. He manages every aspect of his career alone. No regrets? I've got a few. But I'm not sure I want you as boss. And like this. To Fleche Records! Health... Prosperity... Knock on wood... and love. Summer 1967 How did your concert go? Shall I heat up some pizza? What's the matter? She's left me. It's not the first time. France and you... No, this time it's for good. She'll never come back. My Claudio... You have all the girls you want. You're successful, rich and handsome. Stop saying I'm handsome. I'm short, bowlegged and I sing like a duck. Johnny Hallyday and Sylvie's Baby Son Doing Fine Hello, madam. Come in. You must be Isabelle. Welcome to the Mill. I'm Chouffa, Claude's mother. - Did you find it easily? - Yes, thank you. Claude's working. He'll join us later. There he is. She's pretty. Who is she? Looks like France Gall. But she's not. Play the next one. "For Me"? You said no in May. Too sad. Now I want a sad song. Go on, play it. Again. It reminds me of... I see it as... I don't know... the end of love. Try to find lyrics about... a man's pain, real despair. Play it again. Like every day... I rise from bed... But you don't stir... "Comme d'habitude"... Good. "Comme"... "d'habitude"... It gets stuck here. Boring. - We'll rework that part then. - Yes. The emotion has to crescendo. My voice has to rise, ending with a wrench. "Comme d'habitude"... Yes, "comme d'habitude"! I rise from bed Bump into you But you don't stir "Comme d'habitude" I pull The sheet up under your chin I fear you might be cold "Comme d'habitude" My hand Strokes your hair Let's say hi to Isabelle. This is Ness-Ness. What I listened to didn't sell. What sold, I didn't listen to. Remember, Mama? I knew I had to choose: Rather than do 100% heart, I do 50% heart, 50% head. Give people what they want. Like the Americans do. What do you think, Isabelle? I don't know. You're 100% heart. It's not you. You were so nice. It's those people, the girls, your life... It scares me. True, I'm surrounded by women. But they don't matter. It's no accident I looked for you, that I did all that, introduced you to my mother. Every time I'm near you I feel the same. You put me at ease. You give me stability. You can give me the life I need. Love me, Isabelle. Love me. Let me go! Damn. And then The day will fade I'll be homeward-bound "Comme d'habitude" And you Won't be around Won't be home yet "Comme d'habitude" All alone I'll lie down On this cold empty bed "Comme d'habitude" My tears I'll hide from view "Comme d'habitude" Even after dark I'll play pretend I'll play along You'll walk in the door I'll be waiting for you You'll flash a smile You'll get undressed You'll get into bed Our lips will meet "Comme d'habitude" We'll play pretend "Comme d'habitude" We'll make love "Comme d'habitude" We'll play pretend "Comme d'habitude" You're cute when you sew. I don't knit as well. You get the idea? From top to bottom, with a fake lining, you can hide a painting. Flatten the canvas under the lining. It doubt it'll come in handy. Don't think that. Everything can be challenged overnight. Believe me. - I'll go. - No, I will. - No, I will. - No, me. Up you go, son. Little Claude, are you angry? Hush, Coco. Easy. Donna, Donna, Donna You'll regret the day Donna, Donna, Donna When you were... Hush. I thought all kids were Claude fans. Little traitor. Let me. Coco, come on. To calm babies, I speak to them in Italian. Oh, you don't play poker with them? Brussels, December 1968 Claude, the messenger's here. Recognize it? "The Voice." Sinatra. Frank Sinatra, Papa. He's singing my song. Sinatra, dammit. Cloclo! Cloclo! What's the matter? Nothing. But when I'm happy, I always figure, shit, something bad's going to happen. Stop torturing yourself. Paulo, France has changed. Since May '68... A good thing, too! - Am I already a has-been? - Cut it out! When was my last hit? When? Tell me when? True, we have fewer gigs. And I have trouble filling 4000 seaters, but most of all with the tour. But it's okay, don't worry. We'll come up with something new, as usual. We've been here before. We always come through. Every time. Trust me. What's wrong? You're tipsy. It's that wine you poured all evening. Watch the steps. Quit smoking. I've told you a hundred times. Thanks for the great evening. Say, why is the casino gala still unpaid? Is there a problem? There was a debt to pay off. What debt? This is embarrassing. I don't know how to tell you. It's not fair, Claude. Tell the casino. It might amuse them to cancel your debt and pay for my gala. Can't we discuss it? Papa should've taught you a lesson when you blew his indemnity. I'm not so weak. Don't say that about your father. Forgive him, Aime. I'm having you banned from casinos! - I've made the request. - So that's how you thank me! Where will I go now? Wherever you want. Josette, friends, I don't care! Even bumming off my guests. But you betrayed my work, my image! You've tainted me! Taha, the suitcases. Christian will take you. I won't deprive Coco of his grandma. You'll see him. But not here. Work it out with Isabelle. Out of my sight! I'll wait until you come back to me I'll wait I'll wait a long time if need be Stay, stay here with me We need each other, can't you see Stay, don't abandon me You'll regret it almost as much as me I know I'm not a perfect man Christian! Get a doctor, quick! Stretcher! An ambulance! The plane bringing Claude Francois from Marseille has just landed. Anxious fans have been waiting. The singer passed out on stage. He's still unconscious. Mr. Lederman! - How is he? - It's very serious. He's totally exhausted. Some respect, please. Stand back! Son, I told you... The "wounded idol" never fails. Look: You haven't had such press in 3 years. - Never again, Paulo. - Now look... Enter the new Claude Francois. Generous, closer to his audience. Look: "Claude Francois Blacks Out" "Cloclo Collapses..." Isn't it beautiful? I owe Marseille the first concert. Where he fell, he rises again. I buy it, son. - You look great. - Thanks. I brought you this. If you knew the force you give me. Nothing can stop me. I've got plans. Big plans! I'm shifting into high gear. I'll astonish you! 1972. Three years later. I have to sing to forget A shooting star who left me flat You can help me Find her again She's got eyes of blue, Belinda She's got bangs of gold, Belinda She's got eyes of blue, Belinda In my dressing room, Gigi hung suits by pushing aside ones already there. One is way on the right with its sleeve caught in the door. From now on... From now on (underline twice), if you put a suit away, make sure that, front and back, it doesn't wrinkle the suit on either side of it. Please pass on to Nicole. Genevieve Leroy: A thought... Why don't we make figurines like dolls in my image? Provided they are exactly true to life. Please answer. Urgent. For my show with Drucker, send him the text of the sketches and my drawing of the two-seated stool for the host. Tell him I plan to have it patented. I know he's going to laugh. Do it quickly. I feel good, It feels nice... Going to the studio at 6? And Gaite Studios? That's right. I feel good, It feels nice Like a rainbow in your eyes When you live Like lovers I love you, Claude! Me too. You didn't kiss me! Slower, Claude. We're behind you. Okay. See you later. I love you, Claude. Watch out for my hair. Claude, my love. Hello, Caroline. We saw you last night... On TV. Claude, we love you. I love you. Give me your hand... Your hand. I read an article about the benefits of carrots. Nicole, in last week's Elle there's an ad for a juicer. Have someone pick up two, please. I'll take one to the Mill. I feel good, It feels nice Life flows like a song As sure as a girl Falls in love I feel good, It feels nice Like a rainbow in your eyes When you live Like lovers - I heard your latest single. - Really? I liked your message on the wall. I've never seen you. Your first time? - What's your name? - Sylvie. Sylvie? - Where you from? - Normandy. Take me with you, please! This is my office. Fans aren't allowed. Please, take me. I can't. I'd like to, but come see me often. - For you. - Thanks. Don't leave me, Claude. Let me in. Your nose is bleeding. Put your head back. Come with me. Don't get so worked up. Sit down there. Sit down here. Could someone see to the girl? A nosebleed. So, Nicole. Well? - You have to sign these. - Again? Here, Chantal. Thanks. Fleche Records... No, sir, Mr. Lederman and Mr. Francois parted ways 2 years ago. That's not star quality. It's more like a hippy look. - It's a good photo. - It's lousy. Why buy out a magazine if it's to get even worse treatment? Redo the photo with the red sequin suit. Got that? - We already printed 140,000 copies! - I don't give a shit! Pulp it! Think of the cost! Is it your money? My audience is out in the suburbs. Why make them return to Paris? How do you see it? Rent a heated tent, take two contract musicians as curtain-raisers, Topaloff and Chamfort, and this winter... we tour the 'burbs. - And rent a tent? - Yes, a tent. And screw the cost! Isabelle's trying to reach you. Say I'm not here. Right, left and jump. Go! Left, right... Left, right, jump! More into the ground! Bounce! - Listen to this. - The Temptations? Tell me if we adapt it. For the next titles, I want a week at Motown. Detroit? No white records there. That's the point. The real sound is there. A week? You gonna start too? And stop smoking cigars. It stinks in here. - Back in an hour. - We'll be waiting. I'm recording a show. We'll be waiting. Can I ask you a question? Why do you always run to your car? If people see me amble down the street, just like everyone else, where's the dream? I get it. Same with wearing sunglasses even at night? Bull's eye. You get no peace, then. It must get tiring. I often think... Cut it. Drive! She's got eyes of blue, Belinda She's got bangs of gold, Belinda I'll get your costume. Your son is here. Fine. So, Coco, did you miss Daddy? - Say you love me. - I love you, Daddy. Who're the photos for? No answer? Jour de France. That's wild! Are these the costumes? Does it look nice? Good. Where do we start? Isabelle called again. For the fourth time. Tell her I'm busy. Isn't it obvious? Since Coco's in Paris, we could all meet at the apartment. Impossible. I've got work tonight. For once. I said no. I have to go. See you this weekend. You bullshitting me? I look like I have crow's-feet. You want to age me? Honey, how about Prunier's tonight? Is that okay? Sure. This is from Switzerland. Take three every morning. It slows cell deterioration. But Claude, I'm 22. It's up to you. Which one, Sofia? It's wrinkled. Intolerable! - This one? - Nice. No choice. I saw you eyeing that guy at Prunier's! Yesterday, I came on to that DJ, today, I want that guy... Sure, I've fucked them all! - Happy now? - Yes, I am. How much you want to stop working? Name your price! Any price! I don't want you modeling anymore. - You're nuts! - Me? I was with you all evening! - You're impossible! - Sicko! I'm sick? Yes, I am. I see your little game. Hey, look. How's it going, faggot! Bring your sister. I'll show you. Beat it! Let go! Drop this tape at the office, please, and tell the secretary all memos should be out before 10 a.m. Thanks. See you tomorrow. - Take them to the pool. - Yes, ma'am. - Did you make up the blue room? - Not yet. Don't forget the swimsuits for the guests. - Is everything all right? - Perfect. - Need anything? - No, thanks. For the American room. With Claude you can be sure. If you can benefit him in any way, he'll be all smiles. Sorry, I won again! A macaroon? That's him in the pool. Thanks. May I? Ali, come serve on the terrace. Love your new American room. Thank you. When does the tennis coach arrive? 4 o'clock. Isabelle! Isabelle, come get Coco! Coco has to pee. Can you take him? Come with Mommy. Your son's a doll. Take over for me? I'll handle this. What's wrong, Marc? I want to play down there with Coco. You know what Daddy said. When he comes up, you can play outside. Like we always do with guests. You be Coco, and Coco will be Marc. Hide-and-seek is fun. Know what we'll do after? Watch a Disney movie, the three of us together. Want to? Go, Marc. Shoot! I'm off. Next weekend I invited the Lagarderes. When's the pediatrician? Thursday. Careful. Hide one under a blanket. And take them up one at a time. I wish you'd stop hiding Marc's existence. It's not a state secret. Don't start again. Know what your mom says... it's bad luck. I don't give a damn what she says! I'm talking about Marc, our son. Imagine how he must feel. You know I'm trying to protect him. I already made a mistake with Coco. I don't want him in the spotlight. He'll be happier without it! Is it for him, or your sex symbol image? Excuse me? One child's an accident, two's a family. Cut it out! Relax about your career, it drives you nuts! Stop it! Stop it. I know there's someone else. I know it. See you Tuesday. So long, Slim. Slim... If some day... If some day things went sour... If I had to sing in restaurants... Would you stick with me? It'll be all right, Claude. It'll be all right. Yes? What is it? Jean-Paul Bert, Fraud Squad. Let us in, please. What's going on? What're you after? Would somebody answer me? The magistrate on the case has informed the singer of his indictment for tax fraud. He risks up to a 2-year sentence... Come eat something. Claude, please open up. They'll realize it's all the accountant's fault. The office keeps calling. Come out. It's not the end of the world. They tried to destroy me, Dad. I won't let them. Leave me. I'm tired. Is something wrong, Claude? Are you feeling sad? They've no right to hurt you. They're just jealous. I'll never abandon you, Claude. Never. Thank you. Someone sold me out. I'm sure of it! Open your ears and keep an eye on everyone. To the new accountant: Every Monday I want a file on all my companies with bank statements, receipts and expense reports for all the staff. Everyone. They all hate me. From the start. Intellectuals, other entertainers, everyone. Look at Sardou. What's he put on his magazine cover? "Claude Francois - Loony!" Smearing me, whatever I do. If I'm not a crook, I lie about my age. If I'm not a teen idol, I'm a faggot who cruises in parks. You find that funny? Am I supposed to cry? Marnay, nothing to say? Yes... It could be a great song. I need others to love me But no one understands My hope and dream Who can say Who I really am? Try as I could I've been misunderstood Because today, I feel Starved for affection People know about me What I want them to see But do they ever look For the source of my glee? And why this despair Hidden deep inside of me? If appearances Aren't always on my side It's not as it seems I'd give up everything To find true love just once But here I am as before... Starving for affection People know about me What I want them to see Thank you for everything. And why this despair Hidden deep inside of me? Goodbye, Taha. Claude, are you kidding? "Comme d'habitude" is your song! Why didn't you talk to him? He's Sinatra. What can a little Frenchy like me say to him? Who am I? Come back to the Mill. If Isabelle hadn't taken the kids to live in the south, would you be here now? Stop with the questions! I need you, Mama. You ignored me all these years. Not even a phone call. I didn't exist. You know perfectly well why. You lacked nothing, did you? True. And I thank you. Come back, please. I'm begging you. Let's live like we used to. You've got to meet Sofia. You'll see, she's divine. Okay, I have to run. - You sure you're okay? - Don't worry. Tell the new accountant to check my mother's expenses for the Mill. Whoever lends my mother money will face me and my eternal scorn! Tell Le Luron I'll see. See his imitations of you? It's wild! Listen, son, imagine: Go on stage with him for one song. Two Cloclos for one! But it's bad timing, Paul. I'm overwhelmed. I heard. You're branching out. Think I'd let them bury me? To Girls Models Agency! Clever! He runs a model agency, and here's the great man always swimming in beauties! Great. Beautiful. Sensual. Good. Perfect. Arch your back. That's a lovely curve. Turn your face. 150 grams, like you wanted. If that doesn't beat Lui! We'll knock 'em down a notch. I'd love to see Filippachi's face. So, who's happier? The press magnate or the photographer? Jean-Pierre, sorry I'm late. Suddenly Suddenly all that's left Is a song Suddenly I listen To that song It said "I love you" That song That keeps coming back Suddenly all that's left is a song I can't take it anymore, But I hear that song I don't believe anymore, Then I hear that song Already No. 1 youth press mogul, singer Claude Francois has launched a perfume line, "Eau Noire." A fragrance the star conceived for men and women. Children! Missed. Careful, Marc. Somebody squealed to the press about Marc. No way! I'll introduce my son to my public myself! Put the kids on the plane for Paris. I'll set up a photo session. The phone weeps When she doesn't come When I shout, "I love you" Revealed: Cloclo's Second Son. Feel relieved? It's better this way. He couldn't remain hidden much longer. You turned the situation to your advantage again. Don't you ever tire of it? - Why? - You control everything, everyone, all the time. When will your system end? In short, you risk bankruptcy. You have 9,725,394 francs in liabilities. A billion, is that all? That's little league stuff. You wanted my men to do an audit. There's your audit. And I didn't include your tax debt. Lay off 25% of your staff. Keep what pays: Podium, the records, the press, and dump the rest. The model agency, too. Not that! You can't take away my chick-catcher! I'll concentrate on what I do best: My art. And target the Anglo market. You handle the rest. I cut the bullshit. As for personal expenses... - What now? - I keep your credit cards. I'll give you pocket money. You're a pain! Your new girlfriend is a dish. Yes, she calms me down. - She's not complicated. - Contented, then? What's that? What's this music? Disco. It's funk to a double-fast heartbeat. Want a tape? Yes, please. London, 2 months later. Shit, guys, you're brilliant! Who does the lyrics? Roda-Gil. They'll stop saying I'm dumb. Roda-Gil? How'd you do it? He says if his kids buy your records he sends 'em to a shrink! Boubou pesters him, I woo him. Gifts, cigars, perfume for his wife. Restaurant invitations. It's all very nice, but I feel he won't write for me. He walks me back to the car, and me, the teen idol, I look the leftwing intellectual in the eye, and I say: "Keep writing masterpieces for wealthy bobby-soxers, "I'll keep singing crap for the poor." Then I split! The next day... He calls me. I can't do anything about it I no longer know what to do Tell her I'm the same as her I still like songs That speak of love and swallows Of sorrow and wind and shivers Tell her I think of her When I hear about magnolias When I hear new music That sounds like a battlefield That sounds good, even if I don't get all the meaning. It must be very clever. Take it again. Enough chestnuts? We have to talk about the unpaid bills. Later, if you don't mind. They'll cut off the electricity. Lay off, Josette. You'll get your money. I'm signing with a new label. They'll pay me a huge advance. So lay off with your stupid bills. Don't talk to me like that. I'm not your maid. Sorry, Jojo. - Here, Coco. - Thanks, Santa. Here, Jojo. Again, I'm sorry. And Mama. I think you'll like it. This is so cool! - Thanks. - Santa delivers, doesn't he? Mama. Ladies. Next year, for your 40th, let's throw a big bash here. Are you nuts? The week of my 40th, I'll hide at the Mill, unplug the phone and cry for a week. Not even a little surprise? No way! You know I hate surprises, Mama. But I've got a surprise for you: This new year will be a big one. In two weeks I sing at Royal Albert Hall in London. England is the springboard for America. Disco's all the rage there. But that's not all. At Easter, I'm taking a vacation. We all are. All together! Back to roots... I'm taking you to Egypt. My God, Egypt! Egypt, yes, Mama. To Egypt! And Christmas, of course. Royal Albert Hall, January 11, 1978 "Comme d'habitude" All day long I'll play along I'll play pretend I'll smile I'll even laugh At last, I'll live Are you really going to America? It's good to start over. So you're going to abandon us? Maybe you'll abandon me. What'd you choose for tomorrow? Gray slacks and blue sweater. Great. Get home safely. See you tomorrow. Good night. March 11, 1978. It's already 20 to. They expect you at 2 p.m. It's okay. I know Drucker. He's so afraid I'll be late he adds an extra hour. How many will you be? About 15. Did you get an extra waiter? What do you take me for? Don't forget to turn on the sauna. Put Josette on. She's not here yet. I'll call her back, then. Mama? You should get some sun. This weather... is delightful. Get your skin ready for Egypt. Kathalyn sends love. Ciao, Kathalyn. Love ya. - I'll let you go. - See you later. Big hugs. See you tonight. Give me 10 minutes. - Come on, Claude. - Shower time. Yes, Remi. He'll be on the set in 30 minutes. Okay. - What? - Rehearsal at 3 p.m. Taping at 7. No time to go home in between. Who was that? A wrong number. Want me to do it? We can't tell her. Not like this. I can't face it... I can't face it. Hi, Jojo. What's the matter? What's wrong? The weekend's off, Mama. Claude had an accident. Oh, my God! Serious? It'll be all right. We'd better go to Paris. It'll be all right. Come on. We have to go. Chouffa? Paul? What're you doing here? Did you see Claude? What's going on, Paul? How is he? They won't let me see him. They won't tell me anything. Don't tell me it's over, Paul. Let us in, I'm begging you. Veils on the girls Boats on the Nile I'm in your life I'm in your arms Alexandra, Alexandria Alexandria, Where love dances with the night I have more appetite Than a barracuda I'll swallow the entire Nile If you don't hold me back! I'll swallow the entire Nile If you don't hold me back! Alexandria, where you make love Dancing in the sheets Tonight, I'm burning hot And you're ice cold The mermaids... Of the port of Alexandria Still sing... The same melody The beacon lights of Alexandria Drown the butterflies of my youth Claude Francois sold 67 million records. My Way, the adaptation of Comme d'habitude, is the most famous song in the world.
