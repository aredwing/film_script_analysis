She and I thought we'd go there. There's some really beautiful houses along the coast. I think it'd be a good place for us. - You want me to go with you to Maine? - Why not? I figure you and I have a chance to start over. Most people don't get that second chance. - You really feel that way about me? - No. - I think you're a greedy, two-faced bitch. - What?! There's no reason I should trust you- but I want to. If you're straight with me, maybe we could help each other. What do you say? Two suspects have been identified in yesterday's brutal slaying in a Hilton Hotel room... ...of Stanley Jones, son-in-law of prominent Las Vegas businessman William Maranot.

This is it. Yeah. That's Indian Rock. See. I'll show you. Right here. This is where I'll sink the boat. They'll search and search for us for months, but they'll never find us. The debris coming up, that can only mean one thing. Of course, like I say, we'll have a healthy swim to the shore. And then about, uh, a five mile hike up to the drop point. Five miles? You'll make it. Drop point's up there. And at that point, we'll pick up the money and the supplies we need to make the last leg of the hike. - Where do we hide the money? - We bury it, along with the supplies. Right here. On Indian Land.
