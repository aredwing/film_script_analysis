You said it yourself, Daniel. 234 00:24:17,708 -- 00:24:21,041 Well, maybe not. But Daniel says he saw Matt Marvelous... 235 00:24:21,128 -- 00:24:24,912 get kidnapped by three vampires who looked like Wildwind. 236 00:24:27,342 -- 00:24:29,964 I never actually said, "vampires." 237 00:24:30,262 -- 00:24:32,005 Do you have a better explanation? 238 00:24:32,097 -- 00:24:35,798 Whoever or whatever they were, they were pretty convincing. 239 00:24:36,101 -- 00:24:38,343 Now I don't know what to think. 240 00:24:38,437 -- 00:24:40,762 When did this all start, Daniel? 241 00:24:41,148 -- 00:24:44,647 Ever since I was a boy, my grandfather told me the Yowie Yahoo... 242 00:24:44,735 -- 00:24:47,652 lived in Vampire Rock. I never believed him. 243 00:24:47,738 -- 00:24:49,315 But in the past few months... 244 00:24:49,406 -- 00:24:52,905 there have been a lot of strange lights and sounds coming from up there. 245 00:24:53,410 -- 00:24:56,328 I'd love to find out what's really going on. 246 00:24:56,747 -- 00:25:00,579 Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands. 247 00:25:05,797 -- 00:25:07,126 A mystery? 248 00:25:07,216 -- 00:25:09,671 We'll need to investigate this from the inside. 249 00:25:09,760 -- 00:25:13,627 And the best way to do that is to go undercover as a rock band. 250 00:25:14,181 -- 00:25:18,131 If we're lucky, the Wildwind vampires will try to kidnap us next. 251 00:25:19,436 -- 00:25:21,345 I don't want to be that lucky. 252 00:25:21,438 -- 00:25:23,098 That's a great idea, Freddie. 253 00:25:23,190 -- 00:25:25,266 I'm not so sure about this. 254 00:25:25,776 -- 00:25:27,815 They may be our only hope. 255 00:25:28,529 -- 00:25:30,901 I guess it could work. Especially if it keeps... 256 00:25:30,989 -- 00:25:34,026 my pick to win the contest from getting kidnapped. 257 00:25:34,117 -- 00:25:35,362 And who's that? 258 00:25:35,452 -- 00:25:38,204 Two Skinny Dudes.
