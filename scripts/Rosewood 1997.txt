Dance tonight, Put that horse in the stable. I'll take care of him for you. That's a pretty horse, sir. Thank you. Now, Lemuel, you know me, I'm fair. I charge a dollar a jug. But since you're into me for $12 already, I'm going to have to put you down for three. Three dollars? Oh, now, Mr. Wright, that ain't fair. I... I know I owes you a lots, but I'm a regular customer. One dollar. Thank you, Mr. Wright. You better stop drinking, Lemuel, before I own... your house. Free of charge. Go see after your father. Thank you, Mr. Wright. Future customer. Sorry, I don't extend credit to strangers. You own that plot of land across the way? I will... this time tomorrow. Look at this, all these melons, no good. Spoiled. Hog food now. Jewel, darlin', you got to throw these out. You got some.45 shells? Clean out. Be going to Gainesville first thing in the morning. I'll pick some up. You still be around then? Might be. What's wrong with you two today? Every time I try to tell you to do something, you won't listen. You know, I will smack you. I'll smack you. No more playtime for you, none. Not today. Mornin', teacher, ma'am. I wonder if you can tell me... where a man can find hisself a good meal? Y'all go inside. Well, my name ain't "teacher, ma'am." It's Beulah. Folks I know call me Scrappie. Well, folks I know call me Mann... Miss Scrappie. Nice to meet you, Mr. Mann. Likewise. Now, this here Rattler, Mr. Mann. He a deer dog. He help me hunt, 'cause he can get real quiet, know what I mean? All right, come on, boy. This way now. This way. So, what, uh, what you selling now, Mr. Mann? What makes you think I'm selling something, Mr. Carrier? Well, I figure a colored fellow with nowhere particular to be, that man be sellin' something... or he runnin'. Well... you figure wrong... friend. Come on inside. Hey, Gertie, got some good news. Mr. Mann here ain't sellin' nothin'. Turn that music down. My husband got a suspicious mind. Oh, yes, I do. He's sweet on you. Scrappie, come over here and help me with this bird. Must be New Year's. Yes, sir. Come on in, Mr. Mann. Evenin', Mr. Mann. Ma'am. Thank you. This is my brother James, his wife Emma, and their daughter Jewel. Be quiet. Scrappie, show the man a seat. You can sit here. Thank you. Scrappie! Now, I had a talk with Mr. Andrews... on your behalf today. What about Mr. Andrews? Mama, that old cracker... caught hisself whistling at Scrappie and all that. What? Yeah, that's right. I went over there and gave him some words. Sylvester, what you say to them people now? Mr. Andrews, I come to have a word with you about my cousin. Now, I expect you to show her some respect. You expect, boy? I don't like Scrappie feelin' scared around nobody. That a threat? Ain't no threat needed. I'm just sayin' I don't mess with your peoples, I don't want you messin' with mines. Now, I thank you very kindly, sir. Sylvester, you can't talk to white folks like that... and not expect a rope around your neck. Look, times is changin', Mama. Now, I ain't no sharecropper. I'm a music teacher. Times ain't never changed for no crackers, boy. Don't you forget they burned a colored man... over in Wylie last summer for winking at a white woman. Sure did. I know that, Mama, but it's all right for them to whistle at Scrappie? No, that ain't right. What do you think about all this business, Mr. Mann? Oh, that man ready to eat. Would you like to say the blessing, Mr. Mann? No, ma'am. I'll do it, Mama. I'll do it. Thank you for the bounty of our lives... and the blessings you've bestowed on us... at home and family. Can I have my yams now? Who wants ham? I want some yams. Scrappie, come eat a part of the bird... that went over the fence last. Well, at least ask him... all right, all right. Ma'am, I ain't had a supper like that in a long time. Thank you kindly. You're welcome. You been drifting long, Mr. Mann? Seem like forever. That ain't no kind of life for a man. You get yourself a good piece of land, the right woman... a man can make a new start 'round here, make something of hisself. Ain't that right, Scrappie? Well, Aunt Sarah think Rosewood colored folks' heaven on earth. Best place these old eyes ever seen. Colored folks own all the land around here. All the businesses, too, except for Mr. Johnny Wright's store, and he a halfway decent white man, if there ever was such a thing. Most of us doin' better than them folks over in Sumner. You ever seen a place like Rosewood, Mr. Mann? No, ma'am. "Well, we know how to get money when we need some," said Pecos. "All right," nodded Essex. "That's fine. "But don't tell anybody I told you... "or I'll cut off your ears." He's a tough character, Essex. "Well, cross my heart and hope you die," replied Lightning fervently. "Well, that's fine," replied Essex. "Now, go home and shut up." "Or lose your ears," added Thunder. And that's it. Next chapter next week. I'm going up Sumner, buying a drink for some of the boys. John, I was thinking we might read aloud... from the Good Book tonight. It'll still be good tomorrow. All right, boys, up to bed. Dad, come on. Dad, could we please stay up just a few more minutes? Best do what your ma says. She ain't my ma. Timothy. What'd you say? What'd you say, Timothy? What was that for? That's so you don't get to thinking like your brother. Get on to bed now. Get on to bed! Sorry about that, Mary, love. I guess the boys still miss her. You do, too, I reckon. You're damn right I miss her. Pardon me. Only natural. Only been gone I'm going to that auction tomorrow. Get that plot of land. Does that mean we're staying, then? Ain't no sense of moving away. I get Bradley's 5 acres, build some bins out back, sell feed. Make enough money, in a few years, we'll move to Gainesville, open a bigger store, biggest they ever seen in Florida. Did you ever consider how I feel living here? Why don't you go on and have that drink? You be all right alone here New Year's? I got Jesus with me. Go ahead. There he is. Gertie looks good. Watch yourself, there, Carter. Watch yourself there. I'm gonna cut a rug. Cut a rug. Go on, cut that rug, but don't cut it too deep. Come on. Dance like he's riding Booker T. Twirl that man, Scrappie. Listen here, now. Y'all take notes, all right? I don't want to have to do this more than once. Come on, man, show him how to do it. Sylvester can't do no dancing. Africa. Africa. Nigerian. My arm! My arm! My arm! My arm! I got you. I got you. I... I brung you some coffee. I'm sorry. It's all right. I shouldn't have snuck up on you. You ridin' out today? I might be here a couple more days anyway. Thinkin' about lookin' in on that piece of land over there. Bye. Mornin', Mr. Mann. Mornin', boy. Tomorrow's my birthday. You gonna come to my party? You gonna have cake? Yes, sir, chocolate. Why is she skippin'? Good coffee. Morning, Mr. Mann. Small town, people talk. Old hangover remedy. My granddaddy taught me. Here's to the new year. I'm sober now. I'm sober now. You got some peaches? Story going around is you was over there in the big one. How long you fight? Few months? A year? I'm a veteran myself, Navy. Spanish-American War. Of course, the ass we kicked only took one day. Steamed into Manila Bay May 1, 1898, aboard the gunboat Concord under old George Dewey. Set them 8-inch guns a-blazing till smoke blotted out the sun. Sunk the Spanish fleet, steamed out May 2. Only eight Americans got wounded. I had the audacity to be one of them. Where were you? France? Put my foots in Germany, too. Germany? I'd like to see the Kaiser's face... when you come runnin' out of the Black Forest. We didn't have no coloreds on the Concord. Whole ship full of good ol' boys. Wouldn't have took to it. Maybe. The mortars start flyin', the gas start blowin', there ain't much color in them trenches. Is that right? You got them.45s? .45s. Funny thing about the draft. I can't understand it. Pull a colored boy out of his home, send him over there, tell him dig trenches, kill white folks. That seem right to you? I wouldn't know much about that, sir. I volunteered. You been double-timing me. Seeing that married Miz Connelly over in Wylie. I know. Where you going? Back to work. Don't you turn your back on me... when I talk! Damn swamp tramp! What you crying about? What you think you're doing, hitting me? You little swamp tramp! You little swamp tramp! Huh? You little chigger! You don't hit me! You don't hit me! You don't hit me! Girl... Get out! Get out! Get out! Philomena! M-Miz Taylor? Is you all right, ma'am? Go away, Philomena. B-But... Get out. Get out! So you fight in the war? Kill anybody over there? I mostly dug trenches. Still, it must've been grand seeing Chicago... and New York. Shoot, I ain't been nowhere but Rosewood, Sumner, Cedar Key, three times to Gainesville. Why you come back south? Maybe... I was looking for Rosewood. Thank you. Well, how come you ain't never settled down before now? I was married... once. My Aunt Sarah, she say I ask too many questions. I'm sorry if... How old you be, Scrappie? I'm 17. No man? - No young ones? - No. I just take care of my little cousins, though. Come on. Come on. Where you going? What you think about this land here? Well, I... I likes it fine. Mr. Wright... He going to buy it, though. He buying up everything. Maybe. Hey, anybody! Hey, boy! Yes, sir. You a traveling man? Who asking, sir? We gots to help him. He ain't our problem. He a Mason, took the oath, same as us. He's a white Mason. Do you think he'd help you? Aaron, boy, I swear, sometimes you ain't got more sense than some of these horses. Now, I'm telling you... that man... he ain't nothing but trouble. Yeah, well, let me tell you something. See, I ain't no boy. See, I's a man. I's a Mason. What you be, Sam? Everybody sit down. Let's get this done. Bradley, you got the deed? Uh, yes, sir, I do, Mr. Andrews. No, no, boy, I haven't paid for it yet. We got to sell it first. Here. Give it here. Give it here, boy. We gots here 5 acres in Rosewood... adjacent to Mr. Johnny Wright's store... sold as is, cash only. Let's open up at $52 an acre. from Monroe. Who'll give me 54? John Wright again. Thank you, John. Monroe, 55? $54. Going once, going twice... $55. Boy, you know that's $55 for each acre? That's damn near $300. Yes, sir, I do. Thank you kindly. Cash? Where's that nigger going to get that kind of money? I have $55. Get back to work. Afternoon, Miss Fanny. Help! Help me! Somebody please help me! Somebody! Help me! Help! Help! Please! Help me! What's the matter, now? Please help me! Help me! What's going on? Fanny, what happened? Nigger. It was a nigger. What? He broke in my house, and he beat me up. It was a nigger! It was! Sheriff! Sheriff! Here comes that boy again. That would be Emmett. Sheriff! Take a breath, boy. What's the matter? Your daddy's still caught on fire again? Fanny Taylor got herself beat by a nigra. Oh, shit. Damn. Earl, that scatter gun loaded? No. Where the hell's my... my shells? Can't find my damn shells. Here. Go to the mill. Get James. Hold on! Keep this quiet before I get the whole story. Go. - What's going on? - Mind your own damn business. Come on, boy. When I want you to do something... and I tell you to do it... Fanny Taylor's been raped by a nigger. Go on out there and do that! Hey, James, I need to talk to you. Your wife's been beat and raped by a colored man. What the hell you talking about? $58. $60. Boy, how you planning on paying $300? You got a bagful of gold? Could be, sir. Henry... can't you see what this boy's doing? He ain't going to buy nothing. He's just driving up the price for old Bradley. Mr. Andrews, sir, I don't know that man. With all due respect, Mr. Wright... if that what you believe, maybe you should stop bidding. You gonna let that nigger beat you, Johnny? A nigger raped Fanny Taylor. Listen up. We got to call this off for now. What? I ain't going nowhere. I got a bid in. We'll pick it up tomorrow at $60.50. Let's get this done now. John, Fanny Taylor's been raped by a nigger. My deed. I'll lock up the deed. Boy, your name Jesse Hunter? No, sir. I suppose you can prove that? Got my discharge, sir. Just who do you think you are, boy? With all due respect, Mr. Wright, long around this time tomorrow, I expects to be your neighbor, sir. Welcome to Levy County, Mr. Mann. Get out of the way. Come on, back off, now. Come on, come on, come on. Jesus, Fanny. Who raped you? No, jeez, Ellis, I sure wasn't raped. I just got beat. I was beat badly. Badly. He was so big. He's so black, that boy. She says she was raped. Raped and beat. Shut up, y'all! Everybody go on out of here! Show's over! You heard me! Go on home! Go on! Come on. Let's go in the house. It's OK. It's all right. It's OK. Come on! Give her some breathing space! Damn. Listen to me. We've known each other a long time, huh? I want you to think about this, now. You tell me. This is Ellis. You tell me the truth. Was it truly a colored that done this to you? Be sure, darling, that is all I'm saying. Yes, he was colored. He was a nigger, nigger, nigger! Jesus, angel, what happened? You seen this boy, Sarah? Ain't got to mess around. We got to do something about this. No, Mr. Ellis. I ain't seen nothing. All right. Hey, what y'all doing? Miss Fanny... Miss Fanny Taylor, she got raped. - And beat. - And she got beat, and she said it was a colored man. But it was a cracker. I seen him. Well, I guess now we're looking for a nigger convict, escaped yesterday off the chain gang near Wylie. Name is Jesse Hunter. Oh, good. Here are the hounds. Take them all around back, pick up a scent. Go on. You acting like you the leader of this here mob. I am the leader, and this ain't no mob! We got him, boys. See where they're headed? Y'all see where they're headed? Come on, boy. Shut up, y'all! They got a scent! Hush. Go have a look. Y'all go that way. He ain't done nothing! What did the boy do? Y'all be quiet! Be quiet! Poly! Poly! Put that gun away! - This is serious business. - Yes, sir. You got to tell me the truth, boy. Did you rape Fanny Taylor? - Rape? - No, sir! No! Do you know who did? I don't know nothing, Mr. Walker! You know who did! Go! My boy ain't done nothing! Hey! Here comes old Johnny Wright. Hello, Johnny. Hey, Bobby. John. How's that new wife of yours working out? She's coming right along. Sorry about that auction, John. The boy bid. Yeah, a hell of a thing. What you got here? Now we got a good one. That boy raped Fanny Taylor. Is that right? We got us Aaron Carrier, John. Aaron Carrier? Watch that gun, boy. How you doing, Johnny? You got the wrong boy. Hate to tell you, Aaron Carrier wouldn't rape a fly. Dogs led us straight to his house. You know the boy that did? Nigger won't talk, either, John. I know his family. Let me talk to him. Yeah, hell, maybe you can get something out of him. I sure as hell can't. Aaron, this is Mr. Wright. You know something about all this? Duke, how's he supposed to talk when you're choking him like that? Well, he don't need to talk, Johnny. He need to hang from one of them trees over there. Y'all think this is real funny? Hey, you would, too, if you was the one that sold me this rope. Good point, John. He's a good boy. He ain't done nothing. Duke, don't hurt him. Emmett, come on over here, boy. Hold onto this rope. There's a boy. You know this boy's family as well as I. That's right. I do. I know. And you know he's a good boy. They're good people. They're good people, but we got a dilemma here, John. We got a dilemma. I'm going to tell you what it is. Hounds don't lie. Be a man, now. You got to take that rope and snap, crack. Can't lynch that boy, Ellis. Can't lynch him. I ain't going to let nobody get hanged. I ain't going to let it happen. It won't happen. Now grab that rope. Come on, grab it. About 4 summers ago, I went over to Chiefland. A colored boy over there was looking in the window... at a white girl watching her take a bath. Did he say something? No, he didn't. Maybe he don't know nothing if he didn't say nothing. You should have seen them go crazy on that boy. Beat him about half to death. Boy wouldn't stop screaming. We helped him to the railroad track. Number 7 come along... cut his head clean off. Niggers don't run around like a chicken. Once that head's off, he's dead. S-Sam Carter. Sam Carter? What about Sam Carter? What about Sam? Sam the blacksmith? Sam Carter raped Fanny Taylor? No. A man. A Mason. What man? Who you talking about? Sam took him in the wagon. We was holding the oath. What are you talking about? String him up! This boy's under arrest! I'm taking him to jail! We're going to string this boy up. Oh, no, you ain't! All right, take the boy, but don't you let him go. Hey, don't you worry about what I am or ain't going to do! You hear me, Poly? - We're going to get Sam. - You get on out of here! Do you understand? You go do it! Hey, listen to me. You go with them. Don't let them do nothing until I get there, you hear me? You go, too. Ellis, you go. I'll take old Aaron in. Them boys is all riled. Aaron, this is all your damn fault! You should've said something earlier! Damn! Carter! Carter! Hey, Booker T. Up, boy. Up. Thank you, Mr. Wright. Sam, what you know about this Jesse Hunter, boy? I don't know nothing, Mr. Andrews! All niggers don't know nothing! Where's Jesse Hunter? Mr. Purdy. Mr. Purdy. You a Mason. You got to believe me. I don't know no Jesse Hunter! Yeah, you do, you damn nigger! Come on, let him go! Come on! Hold it! Come on! He's not against you! Stop it! Stop it! You shut up and get away! Sam! Get up! Talk now! Talk to me, Sam! Talk to me. Better say something. As... as God is my witness, I don't know... Jesse Hunter. It was that drifter. That rich nigger from the auction! That big buck with the black horse, is that him? Come on, let him talk. Damn you! Look at me! Aaron told us you gave him a ride! Now you show me where you put him out! Show me, Sam. I can get you out of here. Show me, boy. You going to show me? We going to string you up. Let's go. Get up. Let's go. Get up. If we don't pick up his trail where you say, you one dead black son of a bitch. What you got, Earl? Nothing, Ellis. Nothing? Y-you can kill me... but you all... you can't eat me. You ain't no Seminole, boy. Duke. Get back! Get back! Damn it, Duke! What'd you do that for? Goddamn, Duke. Dumb son of a bitch. You could've killed me! He's sure dead. He ain't dead. Well, let's clean this mess up. Hang him up in this tree over here. OK, men, I've had enough of this! I'm the law here, you hear me? Let me in here! Back off now! Let me in there! Stop it, y'all! Stop it! A white woman was beat and raped... by a colored boy! Now, you want to tell her husband, her children, that this boy don't have to pay for that? I'm supposed to uphold the law! Aw, law! Whose law, nigger law? You wasn't nothing but a damn chicken farmer... till they gave you that stupid badge! You want to get re-elected? You want to get re-elected? - Leave me alone! - Then leave it be! I got your watch, Sam Carter! I got your watch! You're always so gentle. Soft touch. You treat me like I'm some kind of angel. You are an angel to me. I'm just a woman, James. I'm just a woman. Things are getting crazy out there, Fanny. They're likely to get worse. Sam Carter's lynched already. The blacksmith? What'd he do? He give that nigger a ride. A ride? Sam Carter? I didn't know. There's things that I ought to tell you. Evening, Mr. Taylor. With all that's going on and everything, we thought y'all could use some hot cooking. Thank you kindly, ladies, but my wife ain't feeling too well. It's all right, James. Evening, Miss Walker. Oh, Fanny... you poor child. Oh, I brought you a quilt, too. I brought you sweetbread. Don't you worry. That nigger going to be dead... before you finish your pie, OK? Get a wagon. Now, me and Mr. Mann just cut Sam Carter out a damn tree. Y'all hear me? Dirty, low-down bastards... took my boy. They got my cousin Aaron over in jail. There's Sumner behind this business. They say it's for his own protection. Now how that sound? What we need to do, we need to pray. Now, dear Lord... I ain't in no praying mood, preacher. Now, what I want to know is right now, what y'all mens prepared to do if they run back here? Not if, Sylvester. When. I'm goin' to shoot. Come on, sit down now, Big Baby. You by yourself there, Mr. Wright? I am, Sylvester. Sylvester, them crackers so riled up, we don't know what they going to do. They don't know what they goin' to do. That's how a lynch mob be. Now, I say we send the women and children... to Gainesville right now. John, we can't go nowhere and leave that boy in jail. No! Them dirty bastards... can take my boy out of that jail... and hang him whenever they take a notion. Don't worry about it, Uncle. We ain't going nowhere. We ain't going nowhere, Bradley. Now, we own this here land. We pay taxes on it. Now, we don't bother nobody around here. We keep to ourselves. Now, colored folk just can't be running all the time. There comes a time when you got to stand up... and defend your rights. Sylvester! Sylvester! Listen to me. And you listen. Hold on there for a minute. We got to think about these here children. Oh, I am thinking about the children, preacher. Now, you suppose they thinking about our children? Mr. Mann. If there be some trouble around here, sir, we could sure use your help. I just came from one war, friend. I ain't looking for another one. Let him go, Sylvester. For all we know, he could have been... the one that done this thing. They said it was... they said it was a stranger anyhow. You're talking crazy now, preacher. I wish y'all luck. He ain't done nothing. What was that, Aunt Sarah? Mr. Wright, would you kindly excuse us, sir? I seen his face. He was white as butter. What? This what they teach you in the Army? Pack up and run when things get hot? Thank God the Navy don't let in... What? Go on and say it, Mr. Wright. Thank God the Navy don't let in niggers. I was going to say cowards. That's right. I got you figured, Mann. You one of them loud boys, big talk. Figure you can say anything to a white man... as long as you start out saying, "With all due respect." First sign of trouble, you duckin' your head running. What you going to do... when that mob come down the road? You going to grab up your rifle, defend colored folk? What you care? Man does what he has to. Ain't that right? Just like a colored boy back from the war... with a pocketful of money. Ain't that right? You the massa of Rosewood, huh? Say, boy... these people know me. They trust me. How long you live here, Mr. Wright? Nine years. I been in Rosewood one night... they asking me to stay. Now, you pack up your truck... see who tries to stop you from leaving. You wasn't going to say nothing. You was just going to leave me? Three, four weeks, this all blow over. Then I come back. But I thought we... Why, I didn't think you was just going to run off, is all. Ain't you a soldier? Scrappie. Them boys looking for a colored man... ain't nobody seen around here before. Now, ain't no way in the world... one man got enough bullets for all them crackers. Your own preacher ready to serve me up. But if I stay, I'm asking to be hung. Look here. They give me this for saving lives. Most important thing anybody ever give to me. You keep it for me. Hold on to it till I get back. Now, can you do that for me, darling? Morning, Judge. Multiple gunshot wounds. Missing ear... fingers... various other parts. By Jesus, your boys really got to this one, huh, Ellis? Yes, they did, sir. Levy County is growing. We need us a sheriff up here... who can handle these nigger problems. Is that you, Ellis? Now hold on, Judge. Oh, I think I got everything under control now, Judge. I hope so. We ain't talking about... breaking up fights on Saturday night. You can't control your colored, we're going to replace you with someone who can. Cause of death: "Mischief at hands unknown..." Write that down, Earl. All right now! Get on in here! Fall in here, everybody! Now, hush up! Everybody, come on, now! Don't lollygag! I want to give you a day off. What's that, Boots? He says you got the day off. All right! That colored boy what assaulted Fanny Taylor, he's still out there somewhere. So I'm gonna give you the day off... so you can go help with the search. All I expect is... if you find him... well, you know what to do. Oh, Lord, Auntie, they're likely to come in here and kill us all. You got to tell them that man was white. Child, you don't think... they going to listen to old Aunt Sarah? They'd just as soon as string me up... like they done Sam Carter. You ain't never seen crackers act the way I know. When I was a little girl, about 7, still on the Willowbrook plantation... old massa's son stole $20 out of the family chest... for a cockfight. Massa knew he took it. As blue as Jesus' eyes, he knew. But just the same... he whipped my daddy half to death. It don't matter what man was beating on Fanny Taylor. Nigger. It's just another word for guilty. Here you go. Thank you, Mr. Bryce. You're welcome. You're a nice gentleman. Look, why don't you get your peoples on board, Aunt Sarah? Take them up to Gainesville for a while. Don't much like the looks of things around here. Things been looking the same... as long as I can remember, Mr. Bryce. You take care of yourself. Take that. Put it on the side there. Board! Sylvester? - Go inside the depot, Mama. - Sylvester! Mama, it's all right. Mama, go on. Johnny. Sylvester! Do you know the whereabouts of this Jesse Hunter? I do not. You arrest that man who kill Sam Carter yet? Don't you get uppity with me. I've come to warn you. There are some boys over there in Sumner... let on if they was you, they wouldn't let sundown catch them around here. Well, they ain't me... sir. Why don't you be a good boy... and go visit some of your other relatives... for a little while, huh? I am trying to help you here. They're all over there right now getting all full of liquor... and making nooses. You hear me! Huh? Sheriff... If you really want to help... I appreciate it if you wouldn't allow... them boys to come 'round here. Now, I was born and raised in Rosewood. This here is my home. And I'll be damned if I let anybody run me off it. Now, you can tell them boys that. Tell them your damn self. Damn colored fool. Go home, Mama. You're gonna have to settle your account... before I can sell you the shells. Want me to settle the account? That's right. All right. Go home, Jewel. Girl, you best get out of this store. She belongs here. She belongs right here. Do you see how you do my cousin? Get out this store right now, Jewel! Get! Can't you listen to nobody? Sheriff give you good advice. Why ain't you leaving? I thought you a smart boy, Sylvester. I thought you a smart boy. Here is your money, Mr. Wright. That should settle my account. Sylvester... Dumb... Hurry up! Here come them boys. They ain't got nothing. What'd you find? Snakes and ticks. Them colored folks got to be hiding that nigger. What time is it, anyway? Well, let's see... by old Sam Carter. Bourbon time. I'll tell you, boys. If anybody's hiding Jesse Hunter, my money's on Sylvester Carrier. That nigger, he hates us white folk. He does. You know, he's got a piano. A nigger with a goddamn piano. I've been working all my life, I ain't got a piano. You don't know how to play one. That ain't the point. Old man Cummer, up in that house of his, he's got a piano. That nigger's got one, and I don't. Now, how does that look? Yeah, and he's married to that white woman. Gertrude ain't white. Hell, she look white. Well, she ain't. She's half Negress, half-Seminole Indian. He says. It wouldn't surprise me if he was hiding that bastard. Hey, Judge. I tell you, Duke. Can I get that bottle? Go ahead now, make a wish. Blow the candles out. Open this one first, Arnett. Open that one. Oh, yeah, that's nice, Mama. Yeah, that's real nice. You're a man now. You need a suit of clothes. Arnett, open this one here and that one, too. Sylvester got that one. Simmer down. Be quiet! Sylvester, come on out here now, boy. We want to talk to you. Bring that Jesse Hunter on out here with you. Yeah, that's right. Bring that boy with you. Jesse and Sylvester are probably sitting up in there. Shut up that damn dog. Sittin' up there now eating pork chops. Laughing at us all. Goddamn, Duke! Son of a... You had no call to do that. It's just a damn dog, Ellis. I'll have no more shooting. How you expect the boy to come out here... if you're going to shoot his hound? Hell of a shot! Sylvester! You'd better get out here now. Wait, Mama! Mama, hold on! Get out the window, Mama. All right. I'm gonna go get the guns, Mama. You stay out the window. No, Sylvester! Mama, just stay out the window. Y'all children get down right now. Get down under the table right now.

Y'all hear me? How am I going to be paid for all this? You just keep track, that's all. Y'all shoot Sylvester, Ellis? Don't know. They shot Aunt Sarah, though, John. Aunt Sarah! What the hell's the matter with you, Ellis? You let them come here and shoot an old woman? I didn't let them do that. You call that upholding the law? What kind of sheriff are you? Henry and Poly are dead. Shot by them damn nigras. Where'd Sylvester get his ammunition, John? All right, come on. Come on. Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on! Come on!

Bring the train to the old road near Kelly's pond. Get there, listen for the engine whistle. That's on the other side of Sumner, Mr. Wright. How we gonna do that? You're askin' us to take these children... through all them crackers? Can't stop near Rosewood. It's Kelly's pond or nowhere. No men on the train. That's the plan. How we know we can trust you, Mr. Wright? Got no choice. In the trenches now. That's three hours. Get these folks there. I'll bring the train. If you're lying, I'm comin' for ya. Soldier, if I'm lying, you're dead. Yes, sir. We agreed about the men? Yes, sir. That includes you. Johnny, we just went through there this morning. It ain't nothin' but ashes and smoke. Town's in purgatory. Billy, it's a real simple thing, we do it right. They got boys on all the bridges, all the main roads lookin' for colored men. We go in at night, round back to Sumner, pick up the women and children, sweep them off to Gainesville. He's talkin' about Sumner! That's where the whole damn thing started! You're askin' us to risk our engine, Johnny! Who are you Bryce brothers, a couple of rich boys playin' on your train? To hell with you. You boys puffin' around the countryside... wavin' and tootin' your whistle? To hell with you! These are real folks dyin', women and children ain't done nothin' wrong to no soul. That ain't fair, Johnny! Don't talk to me about fair, Billy! They shot Sarah Carrier down like a dog on her own porch! I ain't asking you to risk your train! I'm asking you to risk your asses! Think they gonna let the women and children through? I don't know. Wait, wait. Stay here. Damn. Let's go. We gotta move. How far out are we? About 40 minutes. Can't we move this thing any faster? Push that throttle, J.B. Don't you be telling us how to run our train, Johnny. We gotta take it easy on her. She ain't been acting right. Oh, she ain't? You boys been treating this train like a little sister... since I known you. Get her moving. She can't handle it! Get this son of a bitch moving. J.B., give her a little. Feel better? Yeah. I feel better. I'm tired. I don't feel like going. Hush up. Hush up, be quiet. That truck coming, boys. Watch out, now. Watch yourself. Get on up. Come on. Wait, wait. Might as well come look. Make room for my boy here. Why you cryin', boy? There's babies in there. A nigger is a nigger, boy. None of us like it. God made the world the way it is, and we just got to live in it. You get as old as I am, you become a man... you're gonna learn a lot of things. A nigger is a nigger, boy. That's the way. You understand me, Emmett? You understand me? She's overheating! Damn it! Damn it, I told you! We're stopping, we're stopping! We can't stop. No, no. Don't you get it? Don't you get it? We are stopped! We can't go anywhere! It's your fault! Your fault! Goddamn counterbalance pin! Damn it! J.B., leave him alone. You gotta check the engine. Don't you heathens touch my porch. Step aside. We hear you're hiding niggers in here. Turn around, Earl, before I send us both to damnation. Jesus Christ, Mary. That damn thing ain't loaded anyway. Oh, yes, it is. You got any niggers in there, Mary? Willing to kill a white woman to find out, Bobby? Now turn around and get home. Get on, get! Come on, Earl. Ain't no niggers around here. Come on, y'all. Come on, now. You men best hope the Lord feels merciful come Judgment Day. Hush. Everybody front and center. Lieutenant. Where's Arnett? He gone. Where's Minnie? Stay put. What y'all boys need to get this engine running again? Somethin' we ain't got. Counterbalance pin. What is a counterbalance pin? Oh, it ain't nothin'. Piece of metal about this long. Be quiet. Minnie, be quiet. All right, y'all men, listen up. Let's call it a night. Bobby, Earl, give me a hand. Get these men out of here. Y'all go home. Get these men out of here. Go on. No more camping out in my town! You hear me? Hush, y'all, hush! All right, I see you in there. What you up to, Duke? What do you see? Hold still, now. Right up against that tree, y'all. Go get him. Minnie. Minnie's back. Where you been? What... He gonna get killed looking for you. Show you to rape my wife. Put him up! Simmer down, y'all! I had a nice quiet town here, but you put an end to that, didn't you, boy? Wasn't no colored boy... had nothin do to with what happened there. Shut up. Shut up, Jesse. That ain't my name. Clear a path. Get back, get back. Run the nigger up. Ha, damn you! Come on, you stupid horse! Just shoot the damn horse. Booker T., go! Goddamn. That is one strong buck. Why won't he die? He gonna die, he gonna die. His neck ain't that thick. Oh, he'll die, only he probably didn't have nothing to do with it. Well, truth be told, none of 'em did. What the hell does that mean, Ellis? It means, James, that you know as well as I do... what Fanny'd been doing lunch times. Some of y'all know better than others! That's right. Should have never listened to her. That woman's a wildcat. Booker T.! Shoot him! Sorry I had to say it that way, James, but this thing's gone far enough. Fanny lied... to you, to me, the whole damn town. Deep down, I don't think I believed her from the start. If that's how you feel, why'd you take her word for this, Ellis? What choice I got, huh? I am the sheriff. Damn. My badge. What's gonna keep it in place? Prayer. Move it! Come on, move! Get on board, get on board, get on board. Get 'em on, get 'em on! Come on, move. Get on, get on! Come on. We ain't gonna sit on the track all night. Move! Get them on! Quickly! Let's go! Let's go. Let's get the hell out of here. You can't come on! You can't come on! Let me on this train! I said get down! If they find men on this train, they'll kill everyone! Get off! Please! Stop the train! Get back. If they find men on this train, they'll kill all the women and children! You can't come on here! No! Get down, get down! What the hell you doing? This is a war! We're in the trenches! Jesus Christ! Come on, girl. Child, stay down. Stay down. Y'all can get up now. You can't go, Mann. You just can't. Don't leave us, Mann. Please don't leave us. Hush now. Y'all gonna be safe. Scrappie in charge from here on in. Arnett, you're a lieutenant. You help her out. Take these children inside. Y'all gonna be all right. That's Booker T.! Mr. Mann, who is that riding your horse? It's Sylvester. Uncle Sylvester made it. All right! He made it. Sylvester, how you doing? Uncle Sylvester's alive. I ain't got all night, Mann. Gertie, y'all get to Cousin Wilma in Gainesville. Come on. I'll be waiting for you in Gainesville. Won't be waiting long. How'd you get out? They carried me... in my mama's coffin. They were here. A mob. They tried to get in. What happened? Mom scared 'em off. Boys. Boys. Come here! Get up! Get up! Liar! Damn you, woman! Where you going, boy? You little crab. You eat my food, then you walk away sideways. Emmett! Emmett, come on back in the house, boy. L... I'm sick. My hands is hurting me bad. I need your help, and my back... Emmett, I don't mean to be hard on you, boy. I just want what's best for you. I want to learn you how to live in the world. I hate you! You ain't no man! I don't know what you are, Daddy. Emmett, you come back... Emmett. Don't you walk away. Come on here, boy. Emmett, come on back in here. Which way are you headed? Same as you, friend. Going to catch that train.
