Hey, Nick! What the hell are you doing here? Beats the hell out of me. Straighter. Get your head up. Your back will follow along. Are you on your tracings? Pretty much. "Pretty much" ain't good enough. Your threes aren't good enough. Nick! That was the fastest premed course in history. -What are you doing home? -I couldn't stay away from my girls. -The hell you say. -What did they do, kick you out? I quit. What did you go and do a dumb thing like that for? None of your goddamned business. Well, at least we all know what not to talk about. -Want to go home? -ln a while. Her figures are lousy. For once in her life she's going to show what she can really do. -No big deal. -Yeah, it is. I got to go home and face the folks. I'll see you later. Anything'll be fun after the folks. -Rat. -Bozo. Come on, go, go. Hang on! Watch out for the limb. So, Bozo, what are you doing home? I told you it's none of your goddamn business. What do you think you are, special? Hey, let's see if I've lost my touch. You were scared. I was not. Don't give me that. Let me see. Take off your gloves. No. I want it. All right. Sweaty palms. Sweaty palms? -You were scared shitless. -Oh, come on! It's healthy to sweat just before you die. Come on, Nick, skate! Go! Set it up! Come on! Hey, Junior, your skate's untied. Hey, Junior! Jesus, Nick, this ain't the NHL, you know. The only kid suicidal enough for hockey. Good to hear someone say something nice about that kid, finally. Come on, Daddy. Get in there! Get it! Come on, you pansies! Get in there! No! Don't check with your goddamn wrists. Let's have a little blood flow on that ice. Come on, Nicky, go. Come on, go for it! Hey, Nick, your old man sell off those Holsteins yet? Yep. What's he going to do? He's going to crossbreed with polar bears and spend the rest of the winter in Hawaii. He'll leave you in charge of the farm while... ...he's off in old Waikiki? Me and Mike, the half-wit. Oh, well, two of a kind. Well, if we're through with that, there's something I'd like to discuss. What's more important than finding out what old Buddy here... ...is doing home in the middle of his first year? Lexie's competition. Well, subject closed. Well, I'm glad to see at least you have an open mind. Lexie's a fine skater. But there's a big difference. Seven counties go on in this competition. This is a big-time thing. It's worse than being professional. Little country girl go up there, they'll eat her alive. I just don't want you to get hurt, honey. Marcus Winston, you are so full of bull that it boggles the mind. Where the hell are you coming from? You're what's hurting her. Let her be. She's good. She's got more natural talent than anyone I've ever seen. And that includes those girls at the Olympics. Let me go, Daddy. I know it's scary, but I really want to do it. Christ, Marcus, it's one competition. -She's too young. -I'm too old. It's already too late. If I wait any longer there won't be any chance at all. For what? For me. Just for me. You're killing her. You're going to hold her so tight, you're going to suffocate her to death. -She's going to hate the hell out of you. -What would you know? You run this goddamn broken-down bowling alley and ice-skating rink... ...in this crummy, small town. And you wear those goddamn stupid-looking clothes. You think you're some kind of character? How do you know? What do you know? I won the regionals. Twenty-five years ago. It's a little loose here. I'll just take a tuck in. It's pretty. Well, of course, I was a lot bigger. Don't laugh. Even then. It looks all right, huh? Bea... ...thank you. It was a good-luck dress. Come on, get down. Let's put on the collar. Daddy? Hey, Dad? On your way, babe? Yes. They'll be here any minute. I'll be back in a couple of days. Three at the most. Well, I guess that's your ride. Wish me luck. Please, Dad. Yeah, sure, honey. Hell, knock 'em dead. Do you know who's judging? -Smile. -You're joking. She sold herself-- I hate this. Did you ever see her? Who's that girl over there in the blue? I never saw her. Do you know her? I love her little collar. She's probably wearing it to cover her hickies. 'Bye. Sandra Miller. Pretty good. You've still got a chance, though. For God's sake, anything you're not sure of, don't try. Why? These judges are sticklers for perfection. I've been watching them all evening. 5.5, 5.7... ...5.6, 5.7, 5.6. I don't stand a chance... ...making up enough points. I might as well-- You just have a ball. Final skater of the evening, ladies and gentlemen... Have a ball. ...Alexis "Lexie" Winston, from Waverly, Iowa. Let's give her a real warm welcome. The scores are 5.2, 5.0... ...4.8, 5.0, 5.2. Those bastards! They didn't believe it. They couldn't believe their eyes. They want you, Lexie. They want you to circle the ice. Go, go, go! Ladies and gentlemen, let me give you the final standings once again. In first place, from Des Moines Skating Club... ...Sandra Miller. Second, Amy Styler, from Caro, Illinois. Third, Susan Blackley, Chicago Skating Club. -What's going on? Where are we? -Don't wake up, baby. What are you doing here, Marcus? I live here. -They threw me flowers, Daddy. -'Bye, she was great. They threw me flowers. Are you her coach? Yeah. You do good work. How old is she? Look, Miss Machland, let's start over. I know who you are... ...and we both know that Lexie's training has been lousy. She's had work in figures? She's a natural talent. She's very impressive. You want to train her? I want to find out what her goals are. You think she's that good? She looked good. Of course, it was only a regional. You want to train her. I want to train her. Now... ...how old is she? Sixteen. I'm sorry to have wasted your time. She's very quick. Pardon? I mean, I've seen her see someone on television, you know, like... ...Dorothy Hamill or someone. And she can pick up those moves. But the figures.... She's too old. Figures are only 30 percent of the score now. Yes, they are, aren't they? Well, now, you said she's too old. What's the point in putting her through all that trouble? I said that normally the best skaters are well-trained much younger. Six or seven, yeah, well... ...Iooks like you're a decade late, Miss Machland. Lexie can do it, Marcus. I wouldn't be here if I didn't think so. -I can't afford to waste my time. -Good to hear. Who can? I appreciate your coming by. Damn it, Marcus, give her a chance to be something. She is something. Are you afraid she might make it? What would happen if she became a champion? She'd probably leave here. Come back only for Christmas. You should have seen me. I walked on that rink like I owned the place. Took a few of my Nick old-patented slap shots... ...and they just asked me to try out. That's great. When do you go? In two weeks. Whose car is that? I don't know. Do you want to do that? Play hockey? Oh, hell yeah. It's fun. Come on, I'm only going to be gone a few weeks. What if you make it? That's why I'm going. I know I'm supposed to... ...go to college and I'm supposed to be a doctor. I know I'm supposed to... ...get married and have kids. I'm supposed to end up just like my folks. Every time I start something... ...I see where it's going and I don't like it. But that doesn't mean that I don't love you. Hey, Johnny Holiday just laid on you another triple-golden sweep from... ...golden-weekend time at KXLA, in Ames, Iowa. It's 3: 11 on a Saturday afternoon. Got a beautiful weekend going for us. Where the hell have you kids been? Nick's got a tryout with the Northstars. You're kidding? Hey, Nick, that's just your speed, bumping into walls for a living, huh? -Excuse me. -Lexie, Deborah Machland. She's a coach. She wants to train you. I saw you at the regionals at Cedar Rapids. I think you're wonderful. You've a natural gift. It'd be a shame not to let it take you as far as you can go. It's fantastic. Hey, that's fantastic. As far as you can go. Well, how's the big "O"? The big Olympics. Daddy, I want to do this. Daddy, I want to do this. -Remember when we used to come here? -I really do. You and your mom and this damn pond. She'd lean down and pull you around on your skates, talking to you, left, right. Now glide. You looking down at the ice, scared you'd fall. Hell, it wouldn't have been very far, you were only three feet tall. This was her favorite place. Hell, if you're not from around here it all looks just white. But she could see more than that. Never had a chance to show you. When you were old enough to remember she couldn't come out here anymore. And you thought you were born in those damn things. It struck me you ought to try and look at this place, try to see it the way she did. You see that rise over there? You can hardly see it except for that slight shadow line. Then there's that hill over there with all those different tones of white. Then, when the ground fog comes... ...you can hardly tell where the fog starts... ...and the snow stops... ...and the sky begins. Daddy. What's so sad is that you never really knew your mom. We only talk about her and you remember a kind of an image. But that lady.... I'm not Mom, Dad. Daddy? It's like... ...I felt a power in me. And the sound that crowd makes... ...I wanted that sound. I hear you, babe. You'd better get on back, otherwise you're going to miss the bus. I'll be along. You'd better label everything in the kitchen or I'm going to starve to death. I think my daddy's growing up. You're not queer, are you? It's all right if you are, no law against it. There was a girl here last year. I never knew what a lesbian was until one night while talking... ...she kissed me on the mouth. To each his own, but it kind of takes you by surprise. Here's where we play. Whatever you were doing, caught you! I'll show you the rest of the jail. Twenty-five girls live here on and off, mostly off. You know? Well, it's better than reform school, almost. -Parents get rid of you or you skate good? -I skate good. I was afraid of that. We've already heard about you. This place has no secrets. -The business is no secret. -Business? The amateur skating business. You're in it now, so learn about it. We know you haven't qualified for a big competition... ...so Deborah's going to defy the Amateur Skating Association... ...by taking in an older woman, over the hill age-wise... ...and transform her into a world champ. Maybe Olympics. Right, Cinderella? I hope they don't send the pumpkin. I got you specialized time. Had to call in a few debts to do it. You'll get static from the girls at the dorm, but don't worry. -I don't mind taking the bad ice times. -We need it. You can't imagine what you've gotten yourself into. You have the raw talent, but you're virtually untrained. -I thought you said that Beulah's-- -Amateur talk. We're talking about the Olympics. I want you to know what we have to do. It's never been done before, and I'm unsure we'll be able to pull it off. -How do your boots feel? -I haven't fallen, yet. You'll get used to them, just like you got used to your new skates. There are five girls the judges have been watching... ...sit down, since the last Olympics. So they're the ones that everyone expects to win. Even if you're as good as they are, they'll win... ...because the judge'll think you're a flash in the pan. -But if I can't win-- -I didn't say that. I just want you to know what we're up against. I don't know. If you're not tough enough you're never going to make it. The pressure, the pace, even the other girls are going to kill you. All this takes a lot of time and money, and I can't afford to waste my time. There are sponsors that have put up a lot of their money... ...behind my judgment. And if I didn't believe in you, we wouldn't be here. The only question is: How much do you want to win? How much do you really want to win? Move on him! Come on, let's go! Go, go! Back off! Let him go! Damn it! Break it up! Last few days of tryouts. How do you feel? How should I feel? I feel good. -Wait up for me, Al. -We'll go get a beer. If I were a pretty good shot... ...skate fast, and once in a while score goals... ...I'd still be worried about someone who could skate harder... ...shoot harder and is more suicidal. There ain't nobody more suicidal than me. I don't know why you want to beat yourself to death playing hockey. You even speak English, for Christ's sake. -I didn't make the cut? -What were you taking in college? Premed someone told me. You'll be on the other side of the stitches in this game. Well, am I cut or not? What would a kid, smart, not too ugly, want to play hockey for? If I was smart, could have gone to college-- Goddamn it, don't give me that. Am I cut or not? You're going to Lincoln. -What's Lincoln? -It's one of our farm clubs. You go down there and play with some of those killers for a while. That's great. I'm going to Lincoln. Where's Lincoln? She's good. She's a machine. Ever talk to her? Ten minutes on, "How I got someone to sharpen my skates." Then she runs out of interesting conversation. -lsn't Annette supposed to win nationals? -She's got it sewed up. Fourth in the Olympics, second in last year's worlds. Number one, retired to make a mint with lce Capades. That would've meant number two, a French girl, Ceceil something... ...but she got hurt, or so they say. I think she went bonkers. Whenever a skater disappears you hear she got hurt. But you never really know what happened. -I bet she can't do a triple. -Who can? Besides, she doesn't think she has to. And you know what's really rotten? She doesn't. Yeah, Lexie! Next time you pull a stunt like that, it's over. You hear me? You can get hurt really easily and then where are we? Stupid showoff thing with a triple. But I did it. I've worked on it and I wanted to surprise you. It was a lousy triple. -You didn't even see it. -You're not good enough for a triple. You're not good enough. Let me tell you something. Triples may be big crowd pleasers, but to judges it's a piece of showoff acrobatics. You can't win at this game with that kind of crap. You know what they want, and you do it better than the others. That's what wins. Annette knows that. Every goddamn coach here does. I'm a goddamn laughingstock. Make a fool out of yourself, not me. Now, which is it? My way? Or do I drive you to the airport right now? Control yourself, you're not a baby. Which is it? I want to stay. Please. Did you see his face when they missed that film cue? -You look terrific! When did you get in? -Just now. Take off your coat. It's so hot in here. Take off your shirt if you're hot. Speaking of that, perhaps later. Raven, we've got to pick up the cue after that third spot, thank you. -How good is she? -I've never seen such a gift. It's something natural in her. You see her and you know what it's about. She's a bit rough and old fashioned, but she has it. I cannot read that. How rough? -I'll be ready by the '80 Olympics. -They won't let you. -Brian, sorry-- -Forget it. Am I going to have that cue right for tonight? Skating is one place where they don't like upstarts. We can build up enough media interest that can't stop it. -We? -Yes. It's what you like to do. It's what's gotten you where you are... ...and it's going to get you out of the Midwest affiliate to a network. And because you're a darling. -Does she know what's about to happen? -She wants it. She may not know, but when she heard that little crowd in Cedar Rapids... ...it knocked her right on her ass. She wants it. I see this as a kind of an Olga Korbut thing. Everybody's darling. Hell, we all ended up liking the Russians. It'll be good for both of us. No more "One of the best women coaches in the country"? That's right. Good morning. Good morning, Mary Ellen. Alexis? -Am I late? -No, it's all right. -I've got a surprise for you. -Surprise? Yes. Act natural. Act natural? Come here. Are you out in TV land? Stretch your arms. Center, center, and in... ...up, and out. Good. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Brian Dockett with another sports essay. Better, better. Do that ending now. What does it take to become a world-class skater in six months? And one, two, stretch the arms. Press, up, check. You're about to find out as we follow the training... ...and preparation of Alexis Winston, a skater who appeared from nowhere. Electrifying the audience of the central Midwest regionals last month. Come on, spin, spin! Come on, pull! That's it, go and into the jump. Come on, move. Good, push, push. Into the knee. Come on, jump up, Alexis. Our cameras will follow the transformation of an exceptional raw talent... ...into a world-class skater, under the guidance of American coach... ...Deborah Machland. It is only fitting that her training is taking place here... ...at the famous Broadmoor World Arena, where such skaters as Peggy Fleming... ...Amanda Smith and Dorothy Hamill trained... ...as well as the current favorite for the 1980 Olympics, Annette Brashlout... ...runner-up in last year's world competitions. The sensation from Waverly has yet to win a major competition... ...but has already won the heart of everyone she has met. Attack it! And attack! Better. Whip. Again. Faster. Again. Right now. Get your left arm and shoulder down. And whip! Okay, cut it. That's good. We're all a little bit tired. -We got a lot of good stuff today. -You don't have to shoot it. There are 15 girls in the country that do that move twice as well as you. Now, let's get to work. Okay, shoot it. And snap! Here she comes. Where's your TV crew? Snubbing everybody or is there a list? Oh, God, I've got a disease. Yeah. Success. It's all right. It isn't catching. Just irritating. Thanks a lot. Look, I'm easy. It's hard for some of the girls. They've been doing this for a long time. You come along, take their ice time. It's fantastic. Nobody ever got anything like that before. Sure they're pissed. Screw them. So much for the dumb bozo from the sticks. I mean, after a while it gets a little old. -I mean, I'm working my tail off. -What's worse is they know you're good. I can't believe it. It's set? An expanded version of the essay series to be made part of Christmas in America. -And Alexis is in? -They bought it all. -And only one turndown from the top five. -Annette? The only one that doesn't think she needs exposure. Bobbie Braker, Sally Richards, the Canadian champion... ...Wen-An Sun from Taiwan, and the best... ...the French have been heard from. Ceceil Monchet, number two in the world. I thought she was bonkers. Talked to Thimitch myself. Apparently she's fine. He wouldn't say what went wrong... ...but he's anxious to get her back in the minds of the American judges. In a nice, non-competitive exhibition, no pressure. No pressure. -Hello. -Hi. Hi. How's it going? Did you see the cover? Yeah, it's great. Sports lllustrated. You're doing all right. They were so nice. They had two photographers and everything. Well, you're a star. -I'm sorry. -Thanks for the clipping on your game. Lex? Two goals, that's pretty good. Lex, I want to-- Sioux Falls is a hard team. I quit today. I'm just kidding myself here. I don't want to play hockey. -Oh, baby. -Don't worry about it. I don't even think I give a damn. I don't know what I want. I mean, what I'm telling you, I don't know what I want to do. I don't-- Look, what difference does it make? Can you come here... ...for the TV special around Christmas? I don't think so, okay? Not right now. I love you. Yeah, I love you, too. Okay, very nice, girls. Come on in, very quickly, please. You all looked good. These are the competitors for the 1980 World Olympics. This is Brian Dockett presenting, as part of Christmas in America... ...A Winter-Olympic Preview. We are happy to be a part of your Christmas morning... ...and proud to present six, young, international skating competitors... ...heading for the 1980 Olympics. From France, and currently favored to be the next world champion, Ceceil Monchet. From California, and second in the senior ladies nationals last year... ...Bobbie Braker. Canadian champion, Sally Richards. And introducing, Alexis Winston. Ceceil, it's not important. Ceceil, it's not important. Only you matter. Ceceil, come. Ladies and gentleman, the French national champion... ...Ceceil Monchet. There she goes again. Do you want to stay on this? Okay, if she goes down again, I'll have the girls ready. Okay, here we go. Smile, let's go quickly! Kill that spot. Somebody get rid of her. Kill the spot! It's nothing, don't worry. Alexis? It's nothing to do with you. Everybody knows she wasn't well. Maybe she shouldn't be skating anymore. You were a smash. Everything we've been working for, hoping for, it's happened! What's important is... ...that yesterday nobody knew of Alexis Winston. You qualified for the sectionals. Come on. I won't let anything happen to you, okay? You were wonderful! Absolutely wonderful! Hello. Wonderful. Let me introduce you. These are your sponsors. All gone. What do they want? Nothing. To see you. Touch something that's exciting. A winner. And that's what you are, Lexie. Why do they have to touch me like that? Because they want to... ...touch someone who can do something they can't. -We're on display, aren't we? -That's right. And damned lucky somebody wants us to be. Everybody out there tonight, everybody who saw you today... ...would change places with you in a minute. Don't worry about it. You're the star. You want to give it up? No. Scared? I don't know what I'm scared of. Nothing. You're not afraid of anything. Okay, here we go. -Remember, concentrate. -Give her the tight shot. Don't zoom in yet. Lead her, lead her. Reviewing the overall standings here at the Broadmoor World Arena... ...where the 23rd annual Midwest sectionals will, we hope... ...send a champion to the nationals next month. All the training, all the sacrifices. And I don't mind telling you... ...I think I'm more nervous than Alexis is. But this is the bottom line. And fourth overall, the astounding new skating discovery... ...who is also training here at Broadmoor, Alexis Winston. Nothing, you're not afraid of anything. Remember, nothing. Now, ladies and gentlemen, the girl from Waverly, Iowa... ...in fourth place overall, Miss Alexis Winston. -We would like to see the performance. -Will you please sit down? Okay, hold your horses. Fabulous! Ladies and gentleman, here are the scores for Miss Winston: 5.8, 5.7, 5.7... ...5.6, 5.9, 5.8. And we have a new Midwest regional champion... ...Miss Alexis Winston. This is what amateur skating is about and we are very proud... ...because this shows that a person like Alexis... ...anybody with the energy, the spirit, to them no door is closed. -Baby, thank you. -Come here, you. I love it! I love it! Everything is in place for the awarding of the trophy... ...to be presented by the President of the Broadmoor Skating Club. Lexie, do you hear them? In third place, representing the North Skating Club... Nick! ...Susan Blake. -Congratulations, Susan. -Nick, you came. In second place, the defending national champion, a fine skater... ...who'll be a strong challenger at the nationals... ...and later in the world competition, Annette Brashlout. Please Nick, I have to go. It looks like you've got everything you need. Ladies and gentlemen, Alexis Winston. Why don't you just go try out for another hockey team? Ladies and gentlemen, this is what amateur skating is all about. We, at the Broadmoor Arena.... And now, we're sure that this is the next national champion... ...and one of America's Olympic hopes. Ladies and gentlemen, Alexis Winston. Oh, God, Lexie? Here we have the first slice of the examination. Through the base of the brain, we see some of the bony structures here. And the brain itself looks fine at this point. We're beginning to see a bit of abnormality... ...with just a little swelling in this area. Here's the real problem. This white area represents a blood clot in the brain. And this darker area around it represents some swelling of the brain tissue. -It's a nice scan, Diana. -Thank you. And here we seem to be right in the middle of the blood clot here. It looks like it's a little smaller than it was on the prior study, a few days ago. So, there has been some lysis. What is that? That just means that it's dissolving. The body is taking care of the clot. I don't see any new clot. This was the one done the day that she came in and was injured. It's a bit bigger here on this first day. And this, I believe, was three days later. And it's a little smaller then and it appears to be even smaller now. I don't see any new bleeding into the area. Let's print them, Diana. Hi, babe. Daddy? Is she blind or isn't she? When she first woke up from the coma... ...she said all she saw was darkness. At least now she reports seeing some light and shadows. Usually this sort of thing... ...either gets better or worse in a few days after the injury. After that, what you have is what you have. I'm sorry we couldn't do more. I understand she was very promising. Yes, she was very promising. Lexie? Honey, Brian's on the phone again. Come on, Lexie, he just wants to know how you are. Tell him. What? Goddamn it, I'm not talking through closed doors in my own house. Tell him what? I said, tell him how I am. Tell him I can't see. Is that what you want? Tell him that you just sit here and you don't see? Yes! It's still a pretty place, Lex. If you shut your eyes... ...you can put together a pretty good picture of this place. I want to go home. What the hell's going on? Hey, Marcus, what the hell do you think you're doing? Marcus, what's the matter with you? You drunk or something? Christ, Marcus, I'm not out of the pit yet. Damn it. Stop it! What the hell is he trying to do? What the hell are you trying to do, Marcus? I said, stop it now! You get out of here or I'm going to get Matt. Get Matt down here. Get him to set those pins. There are no pins down there. You've got ten seconds to get your ass out of here. Did she ever talk to you? You just go to the house and go up to her room. Is that it? What do you talk about, Beulah? You go up. You're both skaters. You both won the regionals. -What the hell, you got a lot to talk about! -She won the sectionals. We watch TV. What? I said, we watch TV. But she can't see it. She listens. She listens, and I watch. All right? I don't know what to do with her. She says, "What's the point graduating from high school?" The least she could do is graduate. Right? Why? You're a great, goddamn help, Bea. If you hadn't filled her with all that crap: "Everybody's got to do it just once in their life." She did it just once. Don't you start up with me, Marcus! Don't you dare start up with me. You sitting out there... ...hanging on to her like some damn doll! I just want her to be okay. She's dying out there. Maybe it's my fault, I don't know, I don't care. I just don't want it to be like this. She's all there is. Lexie? Honey? Is this your mother's stuff? Come on, Lexie. Let's go downstairs. Lex, you've got to get out of here. Is that your mother's sweater, Lex? Are you taking stuff out of that trunk? -Take it off. -Leave me alone. Leave me alone. If you can get around, get it off. If you can come up here, take that damn sweater off! Come on, Lexie! Give it to me. I won't have you wearing that sweater! Poor little, Lexie Winston, she was so promising. Now she just sits in the attic in her dead mother's clothes. -Who the hell are you? -I'll tell you who the hell I am. I'll tell you who I am. I'll tell you who the hell I am. I'm a stupid character, in stupid clothes... ...who runs a goddamn stupid bowling alley... ...and ice rink, a goddamn pathetic rink. And I come up here and I look at you. And I see.... God, I see... ...somebody I thought could be different. But you're just like the rest of us, another damned invalid. Nobody's going to blame a helpless invalid for giving up. Isn't that what you were thinking when you took that jump? You wanted to find a way out. Well, you sure as hell found it! Son of a bitch! I'm sorry, honey. I just can't stand it. You can't? Pretty tough... ...for someone who is blind and... ...4-foot-10. 5-foot-3. I didn't mean to hurt myself. I didn't want to hurt myself. I didn't. It's all right, baby. It doesn't matter. It's okay. We just want you back. We love you. Please, baby, come back to us. Same old pond. I cleaned it out for you with a snow shovel. And it's plenty thick so you don't have to worry about that. All I'm worried about is standing up, not falling through. Well, you go, we both go. All right? Just let me try to pull you along a little bit, okay? Yeah, that's it. Now come on, you're making more of this than is necessary. I'm scared. There's no point to be scared. Old Daddy has you. This is fun. With you. I'm more liable to fall than you. Now you know that. Okay, let's turn around... ...and try to.... I'm going to pull you a little bit. Okay? Now, hold onto me so I don't fall. Okay. Nothing to it. You skate like you've done this before. Have you? Not recently. Careful there. I should tie my shoelaces, so you won't trip over them. Good. Nothing to it. Let's see now. Dad, it's scary. -Am I going too fast? -Dad? Okay. You want to try it again? Okay, come on, pick up some speed now. You're doing good. You're heading towards the edge. Here. There's a hand in front of you. Grab it. What are you doing here? I came to see you break your ass. I can't see very well. I don't know if you're kidding. Just listen to my voice. I'm not kidding. You don't have to see where you're going. I'll guide you. It's hard. I keep.... The ice field is tilted. I keep trying to see where I am. See the edge. Try shutting your eyes. Just get the feel of the ice. Balance. Feel your balance. Nick? Nick? Keep coming. Don't act helpless with me. Come on, keep working. Around. That's right. Follow me. Follow me. Don't make me control you. Feel where I'm going. Just skate, don't be so stiff. Feel the ice. Right. Left. Right. Left. Do you feel the turn? I'm going to go around you. Give me your hand. I'm all right. Right here. Don't lean so much. Stand up straight. We're going to turn around. Come on, turn, I've got you. I've got you. That's it. Now, we're going to glide. That's it. Ready? Glide. Just glide. -Do an axel. -No! Did you hear what I said? I said, "Do an axel." -Nick, I can't. -Don't give me that. You're going to set up. No! What are you doing? We'll go around again and when we're straight you'll do an axel. Shut up! You're gutless. -You bastard. -Can't you do it without the TV cameras? You shouldn't have opened your eyes. You bastard! You're sure a better skater than you are a fighter. I hate you. I really hate you. I guess that makes us even. Well, are you going to sit there and get your ass all wet? I don't need your hand to help me up. Well, you want to quit? Why are you doing this? I tried to hurt her. I really wanted to hurt her. That's three in a row. You quit being a doctor, a hockey player... ...and now you're going to quit on Lexie. You're too much. It seems to me that you have to get away from anything that looks tough. Did you ever skate on a pro team? That's easy. You just get beat up. I know what you're talking about-- -Maybe I know the moves pretty well. -Don't. If you want to spend half your life... ...making up your mind about what you feel like doing, that's fine. But finally you've got to make a move or turn out like the rest of us. You're on your own. Make a circle. Go faster. That's it. You're going to cut towards the center, towards me. Listen to where my voice is. That's it. Make a sharp right turn. You're coming to the wall. You've got about ten feet. Five feet, turn, turn. That's it. All right. Now, go into a sit spin. You're in the middle of the rink. Hell, I did that when I could see. Oh, baby, you did a double. -lt wasn't perfect. -Well, it was damn good. What a girl, what a girl. Nick... ...I love you. I know you don't like me very much anymore. But I love you. I want you. Now? Yeah. Come on. What about Beulah? She's not here. It's only 6:00. I was beginning to think you didn't know how. I don't know where you come up with those harebrained ideas. She can do it. It's five months until the first competition. That's plenty of time. -I don't care about any of that. -Yeah, you do. If you could see you'd be right back in there, with that whole business. -I wouldn't. -I don't believe you. I can't. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. If nobody made her do anything... ...she'd be sitting up in that room staring at the walls. I don't know if she can do it. I just know she's got to try. For who? For you or for her? For both of us. If she doesn't try... ...it's going to be second best... ...for us. Whatever it is. She can skate. I don't know who took that seriously in the first place, even her, but she can. She just won the sectionals. That's all the skaters in the middle of this country. -That's saying something. -It's pointless and cruel. Don't give me that. Not trying is pointless and cruel. Not trying is wondering your whole life if you gave up too soon. Who the hell needs that? They'll laugh at me. They might. Well, they can't know I can't see, otherwise they'll just feel sorry for me. -That's going to be harder. -They can't know. Okay. Dad? The kid's never seemed too smart. But he's right. I'm with you, baby. Goddamn, I sure am. Here we are, the team! The flying wedge. -Fearless! -Suicidal! We have the fastest blade-changing time of any pit crew on the circuit. Call-out distances, the wall's louder. You guys are crazy. You're all crazy. -Lucky for you, I'd say. -Thank God for the loony bin. God protects little children and fools. And she knows she's got her hands full with this crowd. Wow! It seems huge. -Just wait till it's full. -Thanks a lot. $20 a night... ...three nights a week, before the preliminaries. Any time we want as long as it's between 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. -That's great. -That's plenty of time. Okay. I'd say the tunnel is 15 feet wide. There's about 30 feet, 35 feet open to the ice. -Let's cover this up there. -With a mask. -I'll get some adhesive tape down there.... -Great. -Ready, babe? -Yeah, I guess so. Without your skates? Between all of you, you think of everything, don't you? We try. Good even boards. They're easy to see, huh? Easy for you to see. Don't give me that. You're coming into the corner. -Do you know where you are? -Push! Really fast ice. It feels pretty good. Easy corners. How do you feel? It feels okay. Good. That's it. Do a figure eight. That's it. Time it in your head from the corner to the blue line. Come on. Okay, now, one, two, three, blue line, blue line! Good. I want to remind you.... I felt a little sloppy. We finally got some decent scores out of those judges. -At least you're on the board. -Excuse me. Here she comes. -Which way? -Let's do our stuff. -Okay, which way? -She's about 10 feet. She's got a lot of people around her. Congratulations, Annette! Not yet. Good luck. Thanks. Made it. -With this act we should go on the road. -That was pretty damn good. If it's any comfort, the crowd still loves Annette Brashlout. How would you like a punch in the nose? I can't believe I got that 5.6. -Half of the judges have glasses. -I wish they all would. Hi, Lexie. Jesus! What the hell are you doing here? Could we have a minute, please? -No, this is a private-- -Yeah. Sure you can. You can't tell. I saw the program. I can't believe it. -Here. -No, I can do it. You look lovely, Lexie. When I saw you out there, I fell in love with you all over again. Only while skating? It's a funny relationship. You didn't take my calls. No. Do you remember me? Yes. I missed you. I missed you. Do you want to try again? I don't miss you anymore, Brian. Does anybody know? No. Would you ask my friends to come back in, please? Sure. Good luck. Thank you. That was Laurie Fostan, from the Baton Rouge skating rink. Are you going to tell anybody? You know, I really loved her. Yeah. Is that for me or for her or for you? Maybe for everybody. Are you going to tell anybody? Not everybody who doesn't happen to be from Waverly is a complete shit. Yeah. Now, in first place in overall standings the reigning national champion... ...Annette Brashlout. Nice to see it again. How does it look? Beautiful. Good old Annette. How do you think I look? Well, you're just about the sexiest bozo ever to wear a funny blue dress. Miss Brashlout scores are 5.8, 5.9, 5.7... ...5.8, 5.7. A fantastic performance. Ladies and gentlemen, the girl who will undoubtedly... ...be the national champion for the second straight year... ...Annette Brashlout. You okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. Daddy. I'm right here. I love you. Thanks for being my daddy. The next skater to perform her long program will be... ...Lexie Winston. Now, this will be Miss Winston's first appearance since being hurt last year. Let's welcome her back. Ladies and gentlemen, Alexis Winston. Here's for my mom. Lex, the flowers! We forgot about the flowers. Stay with me. You bet. DVDRip by sacrosa :)
