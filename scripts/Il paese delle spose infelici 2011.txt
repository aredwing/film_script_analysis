Sorry. A brooch? Don't you know brooches bring sorrow? You're a dumb-ass. Prick me. Do it, then it won't bring sorrow, as it will have already hurt me. Prick me I What's so funny? Come on I Are you scared I'll jump? Annalisa, did you really want to die that day? No. I didn't want to die. What then? I wanted to fly. - What if you'd died? - So what? People die every day. Weren't you scared? Are you scared of dying? No. I am. Please, don't die. Why? Because you're beautiful. The girls are going crazy there's confetti, shaving foam. It's great. I feel slightly itchy I don '1 know what's been thrown at me with all this mayhem. Can you see me with an iguana on my shoulder? Let's go. - Where? - We've got stuff to do.

They're fine, they're okay. I'll be able to dive for balls. Listen to him I Get your hands off me, no one said you could touch me, you jerk. Check him out! They almost got a hundred. How will you cope without us in Turin? He'll be better off. There's loads of girls there. They won't be going after him I They want the rich guys. The only good thing about Turin... is Juventus.

Why don't you leave this place? And go where? Somewhere else. My life stopped here. What's up? If I was older, I'd take you away. Where the hell have you been? Out. Out? With everything that's happened? We looked everywhere for you. I knew this would happen. Mum... I just don't understand. - Veleno, come on I - All right, I'm coming. Go on, go. When will I get out of here? I don't know. Soon. That guy's not dead, luckily. What a shame I Don't be stupid I - How's the team doing? - Less said, the better. What about the Bari match? I postponed it. We'll wait for you. We're no good without you. Veleno I If you were in here, no way would I visit you. The city has begun celebrating. It's official, Vito Cicerone is the new mayor You're in time to celebrate. Don't just stand there, let's make a toast I - You drink now anyway. - Big deal I What was the secret of your success? I think the secret is not having any secrets and being honest with the voters. Because look, we're tired, we're Wed of being Italy's dumping ground Bravo I Cheers to the barbarians I And the end of a city. Dear politicians, don't come to the elections anymore. We know exactly who you are, we're not scared of you, you disgust us I Dad, I need a favor. Is it something serious? What is it? Get him out. What are you saying? Zaza's got no one. Only you can help him. He's got an opportunity to play in Bari... for Juventus. He's good. For Juventus... Okay, I'll defend him then... - We'll make an agreement, though. - What? I'll get Zaza out, but you mustn't see him again. - And stop playing football too. - What? Go back to studying and find your path. It's certainly not this one. Where are you going? Come with me I Veleno, do you care about me? Leave me alone then. Let me lean on you, Veleno.
