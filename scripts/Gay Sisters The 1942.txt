YOU MUST ASK THEM TO WITNESS IT, YOU KNOW, AT THE SAME TIME TELLING THEM THAT THIS DOCUMENT IS YOUR LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT. OH, I... I FORGOT. THE LAW IS MOST EXPLICIT, ISN'T IT, MR. GAYLORD? MR. KEITH, MR. GIBBON... THIS DOCUMEN IS MY WILL, AND I WANT YOU TO WITNESS MY SIGNATURE. YES, SIR. I HAVE ASKED YOU ALL TO ASSEMBLE HERE... NOT ONLY TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOU BEFORE SAILING FOR FRANCE TONIGHT, BUT TO TELL YOU HOW HAPPY YOU'VE MADE MY LIFE HERE. I SHALL NEVER FORGE YOUR KINDNESS... YOUR LOYALTY... YOUR DEVOTION. MY GRANDFATHER BUILT THIS HOUSE. HE BROUGHT HIS BRIDE HERE TO LIVE IN IT, AS I DID AFTER HIM. YOU, BENSON... YES, SIR. YOU WERE HERE IN MY FATHER'S DAY. YES, SIR. YOU KNOW HOW A GAYLORD HOME IS EXPECTED TO BE RUN. YES, SIR. I DON'T KNOW WHEN I SHALL COME BACK, BUT WHEN I DO, I WAN TO WALK IN THE DOOR AND FIND EVERYTHING EXACTLY AS I LEFT IT. FOR 3 GENERATIONS, A STANDARD OF PERFECTION HAS BEEN MAINTAINED. I EXPECT I TO CONTINUE... INTO THE FOURTH GENERATION- A GAYLORD HOUSE RUN BY GAYLORD SERVANTS IN THE GAYLORD MANNER. THANK YOU, AND... GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE, SIR. GOOD LUCK, SIR. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU TO BE A GOOD GIRL, SUSANNA. YOU'RE ALWAYS A GOOD GIRL. I SOMETIMES WONDER WHERE A GAYLORD GOT SO MUCH GOODNESS. EVELYN THE SECOND... GROW UP AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOUR MOTHER, DARLING, AND YOU'LL BE A VERY FORTUNATE LITTLE LADY, INDEED. OH, SWEETHEART. YOU MAY PUT EVELYN AND SUSANNA TO BED, NURSE. MISS FIONA? SHE HAS TO STAY UP TO SEE ME OFF AND TAKE THINGS OVER. YES, SIR. COME ALONG, DEAR. YOU KNOW, FIONA, YOU'RE THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE NOW. THIS CALLS FOR A DRINK. BENSON, A BOTTLE OF PORT, PLEASE- THE VINTAGE MY FATHER LAID DOWN FOR ME THE DAY I WAS BORN. YES, SIR. AND TAKE MISS FIONA WITH YOU TO THE WINE CELLAR. MISS FIONA? SHE'S THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE NOW. WHEN I WAS JUST ABOUT HER AGE, MY FATHER WENT OFF TO THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR, AND I WENT DOWN TO THE CELLAR WITH BENSON FOR A BOTTLE OF PORT LAID DOWN THE DAY MY FATHER WAS BORN... ONLY I WAS A SON, AND FIONA'S A DAUGHTER. BUT SHE'S MY SON, MR. VAN RENNSAELER. SHE'S A GAYLORD, THROUGH AND THROUGH. THERE IT IS-1887. NOW, MISS FIONA, WE'LL LAY IT IN ITS CRADLE AS GENTLY AS A BABY. I'LL DO IT MYSELF. GENTLY, NOW. I KNOW. IT'S A VINTAGE PORT, AND A CRUST FORMS INSIDE THE BOTTLE, AND IF I SHAKE IT, IT GETS INTO THE WINE. SO I WON'T SHAKE IT. A GAYLORD IF EVER THERE WAS ONE... AND A REDHEADED GAYLORD, AT THAT! IT'S NOT RED. IT'S AUBURN. THERE YOU ARE, BENSON. THANK YOU, MISS FIONA. TO YOU, MY DEAR, AND TO ALL THOSE WHO DIED SO BRAVELY WITH YOU... AND TO ALL OF US WHO ARE GOING TO AVENGE THOSE DEATHS. AND TO YOU, PENN, A SAFE VOYAGE AND A SAFE RETURN. SAFETY ISN'T ENOUGH. LET'S DRINK TO VICTORY. EVEN THOUGH YOUR SAFETY MEANS LITTLE TO YOU, PENN, YOU'VE CERTAINLY LEF NO STONE UNTURNED TO ASSURE THE SAFETY OF YOUR LITTLE GIRLS. THIS WILL IS AS INDESTRUCTIBLE AS TIME ITSELF. GOOD NIGHT, MY DEAR. GOOD NIGHT, MR. VAN RENNSAELER. I HOPE YOU'LL FIND TIME TO CALL ON US. IT WILL GIVE ME GREAT PLEASURE. AND IF YOU SHOULD NEED ME, YOU REMEMBER I'M TO TAKE YOUR FATHER'S PLACE WHILE HE'S GONE. NO ONE COULD TAKE MY FATHER'S PLACE... UNTIL I DO. BUT THANK YOU JUST THE SAME, MR. VAN RENNSAELER. I TOLD YOU- THIS IS MY SON. WELL, GOOD-BYE, PENN. GOOD-BYE, SIR, AND THANK YOU. GOOD LUCK. SIT DOWN, FIONA. NO, NOT THERE. SIT IN THE CHAIR. I SAT IN THAT CHAIR, FIONA, THE NIGHT BEFORE MY FATHER WENT TO WAR, AND HE TOLD ME SOME THINGS THAT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU. YOU SEE... YOU'RE NOT JUST A SMITH OR A JONES OR A BROWN. YOU'RE A GAYLORD, AND YOU MUST ALWAYS BE A GAYLORD, AND YOU MUST NEVER SELL THE LAND. YOU MEAN NEVER? I MEAN NEVER. THE LAND IS THE GAYLORD'S RELIGION. WE BELIEVE IN IT ALMOS MORE THAN WE BELIEVE IN GOD. FIONA, WHEN THE FIRS AMERICAN GAYLORD WAS LYING ON HIS DEATHBED, HE TOLD HIS FAMILY, "NEVER SELL. NEVER SELL THE LAND." AND HE DIED. THAT WAS NEARLY 150 YEARS AGO. WE STARTED BUYING LAND AT THE BATTERY, AND WE CONTINUED TO BUY LAND. WE PICKED UP A FEW PLOTS ALONGSIDE OF TRINITY CHURCHYARD AND ALONG THE COW PATH. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT COW PATH IS CALLED NOW, FIONA? NO, FATHER. WALL STREET. THEN THE GAYLORDS WENT ON TO BUY STEEL AND MINES AND RAILROADS AND WHALING SHIPS. THEY GREW RICHER AND RICHER. THEY WENT TO EUROPE AND TO HARVARD... AND TO THE DOGS. BUT THEY NEVER SOLD THE LAND. AND NOW, FIONA, YOU'RE THE GAYLORD WHO'S GOING TO CARRY ON IN MY PLACE. ALWAYS BE A GAYLORD, AND NEVER SELL THE LAND. NO, FATHER. PROMISE? I PROMISE. THE CAR IS WAITING, SIR. GOOD-BYE, BENSON. COME BACK SOON, SIR. IT'S TIME TO GO TO BED NOW, MISS FIONA. I'M MISS GAYLORD, NOW THAT MY FATHER IS GONE, AND I DON'T NEED ANYONE TO TELL ME WHEN TO GO TO BED. YES, MISS GAYLORD. TELL THE HOUSEKEEPER I'LL SEE HER IN THE MORNING. YES, MISS GAYLORD. THANK YOU, BENSON, AND... AND GOOD NIGHT. THANK YOU, MISS GAYLORD. GOOD NIGHT. GENTLEMEN, THIS WILL... THIS WILL IS ABSOLUTELY INCONSTESTABLE. WHAT YOU TAKING OUT, JOE? GAYLORD ESTATE- JUDGE BARROWS' COURT. THE WHOLE WORKS? 1919 TO 1941. YOU OUGHT TO PUT THEM BEGGARS ON ROLLER SKATES, THE WAY THEY GO IN AND OUT. YEAH. ALL THESE FILES FULL OF LAW, AND A GUY CAN'T KEEP THE DOGS OUT OF HIS HEDGES. BETTER GET PICTURES OF THOSE GAYLORD DAMES, OR ELSE. YOU KNOW THE ANGLE - MOTHER WENT DOWN ON THE LUSITANIA, FATHER KILLED IN FRANCE. 3 LITTLE ORPHAN GIRLS AND ONLY A HALF-BILLION BETWEEN THEM, SO DON'T COME BACK WITHOUT PICTURES! LET'S GO. DICK, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I WANT YOU TO MEE THE CLIPPER AND SERVE LADY BURTON WITH THIS SUBPOENA. LADY BURTON? OH, NO DICE! EVELYN GAYLORD, YOU DOPE! OH, ONE OF THE GAY DAMES. ARRIVING FROM ENGLAND. GOT A HUSBAND IN THE R.A.F. HOW AM I GOING TO KNOW HER? YOU KNOW THE OTHER TWO. THEY'LL BE THERE TO MEET HER. ALL 3 ARE GOING STRAIGH TO THE COURTHOUSE. I KNOW... "LADY BURTON, NOW THAT YOU'VE SET FOOT AGAIN ON AMERICAN SOIL, MAY I BE THE FIRS TO SERVE YOUR LADYSHIP?" I BEG YOUR PARDON. MISTER, WHERE YOU GO WHEN YOUR HUSBAND BEATS YOU UP? IS THIS THE GUY? THAT'S MY BROTHER. WHAT IS THIS? THAT'S THE GAYLORD CASE. A CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE. CAN YOU IMAGINE WORKING ON A CASE LIKE THAT? SURE. YOU COULD RETIRE. THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK. A CASE LIKE THAT AIN'T NO CINCH. SURE. THE FIRST 100 YEARS IS THE HARDEST. CLEAR THE COURT. JUST BECAUSE WE AIN'T THE GAY DAMES DON'T MEAN YOU CAN PUSH US ALONG. NO ANIMALS ALLOWED. NAZIS, THAT'S WHA YOU ARE-NAZIS! MR. GIBBON, AREN'T YOU THE LAWYER IN THE GAYLORD CASE? I'VE NOTHING TO SAY FOR THE PAPERS. ALL WE WANT IS THE GLAMOUR OF THE WHOLE STORY BEHIND IT. SORRY. NOW, YOUR HONOR, AS YOU KNOW, THIS IS IN THE MATTER OF THE WILL OF THE LATE PENN GAYLORD, AND I AM THE PROPONEN OF THAT WILL. THIS CASE WAS ORIGINALLY IN THE SURROGATE COURT, BUT BECAUSE OF ITS EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, IT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THIS COURT, WHERE IT WAS BEING HEARD BEFORE YOUR HONOR'S DISTINGUISHED PREDECESSOR, JUDGE McCARTHY, WHOSE UNTIMELY DEATH HAS BEREAVED US ALL. WHEN DID PENN GAYLORD DIE? IN 1918. 23 YEARS AGO. YES, YOUR HONOR. AND YOU'RE STILL TRYING TO GET THE WILL PROBATED? YES, YOUR HONOR. WELL, JUST WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN ALL THESE 23 YEARS? WHEN PENN GAYLORD DIED, THERE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED ANOTHER WILL WHICH, IT IS CLAIMED, WAS EXECUTED IN FRANCE JUST BEFORE HE DIED. SO THERE WAS NATURALLY A WILL CONTEST. WELL, WAS THERE A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FRENCH WILL AND THE AMERICAN WILL? NO, YOUR HONOR, EXCEP THAT UNDER THE FRENCH WILL, PENN GAYLORD SET ASIDE 10% OF HIS ESTATE AS A TRUST FUND FOR A CERTAIN CHARITY, AND IT'S THAT CHARITY WHICH IS FIGHTING TO ESTABLISH THE VALIDITY OF THE FRENCH WILL. AND WHO REPRESENTS THE PROPONEN OF THE FRENCH WILL HERE? THAT IS TO SAY, THE CHARITY. YOUR HONOR, IT'S I WHO REPRESEN THAT WORTHY INSTITUTION. WELL, MR. WHEELER, AS THE COUNSEL, CAN YOU TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT THIS CHARITY IS WHICH IS FIGHTING FOR THIS FRENCH WILL? IT'S A SETTLEMENT HOUSE FOR WORKING BOYS- THE THIRD AVENUE NEIGHBORHOOD CLUB. MY LEARNED OPPONENT HERE HAS BEEN TRYING TO PROVE THAT PENN GAYLORD WAS SHELL-SHOCKED AND OUT OF HIS MIND WHEN HE MADE THE FRENCH WILL, WHILE I CONTEND THAT PENN GAYLORD HAD AT THAT TIME A CLEARER VISION AND A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HIS FELLOW MEN THAN HE HAD EVER HAD BEFORE. THANK YOU, MR. WHEELER. CONTINUE, MR. GIBBON. WITH THE ESTATE TIED UP BY THIS CONTEST, THE 3 LITTLE GAYLORD ORPHANS DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY, SO WE HAD TO MAKE APPEALS FOR ALLOWANCES TO ENABLE THE ORPHANS TO FIGHT THIS FRENCH WILL, WHICH WE CLAIMED- AND STILL CLAIM- IS INVALID. WE LOST TWO YEARS IN JUS GETTING THE GUARDIANS APPOINTED AND THESE ALLOWANCES APPROVED. AND ARE THESE THE 3 LITTLE ORPHANS? YES, YOUR HONOR. MISS FIONA GAYLORD... LADY BURTON, EVELYN GAYLORD... MISS SUSANNA GAYLORD. 3 LITTLE KITTENS WHO LOST THEIR MITTENS. AND NOW, MR. GIBBON, WHO HAS BEEN ADMINISTERING THE ESTATE ALL THESE YEARS? MR. VAN RENNSAELER, UNTIL HIS DEATH, WHEN I BECAME TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATOR. WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT? THIS SECOND WILL, HAVING BEEN EXECUTED IN FRANCE, WE HAD TO SEND ATTORNEYS TO FRANCE TO TAKE DEPOSITIONS AND EXAMINE WITNESSES. TWO YEARS WERE LOS IN THAT. WELL, THEN WHAT HAPPENED? ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES, YOUR HONOR, WAS WHETHER THE FRENCH WILL SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AND PROVEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF FRANCE OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF NEW YORK. THE SURROGATE RULED THA THE FRENCH LAWS SHOULD APPLY, BUT THE COURT OF APPEALS OVERRULED HIS DECISION. AND HOW LONG DID THAT TAKE? ANOTHER TWO YEARS. AND AFTER THE TRIAL COUR WAS REVERSED, ALL THAT TESTIMONY WHICH HERETOFORE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN FRANCE BECAME WORTHLESS TO EITHER SIDE. AGAIN WE HAD TO ISSUE DEPOSITIONS, APPOINT ATTORNEYS, FIND THOSE WITNESSES, START ALL OVER AGAIN. GRANTING ALL THAT, WHAT HELD YOU UP THIS TIME? WHEN WE GO TO FRANCE, YOUR HONOR, WE DISCOVERED THAT TWO OF OUR PRINCIPAL WITNESSES HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED. THEY WERE ENGINEERS AND WERE SURVEYING IN THE AFRICAN CONGO. BY THE TIME THEY CAME BACK- ANOTHER YEAR. YES, YOUR HONOR, ANOTHER YEAR. AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS OCCASION TO TELL YOUR HONOR THAT THERE WAS NOT A MOMENT'S DELAY THAT COULD BE AT ANY TIME ASCRIBED TO ANY DILATORY TACTICS ON MY PART! I WASN'T IMPLYING THAT, MR. GIBBON. THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR. AND THEN, JUST AS WE WERE ABOU TO HAVE THE WILL ADMITTED TO PROBATE, A FRENCH LADY- WELL, WE'LL CALL HER A LADY, AT ANY RATE- WHO HAD NURSED PENN GAYLORD WHILE HE WAS RECOVERING FROM SHELL SHOCK IN A FRENCH SANITARIUM, CLAIMED THAT PRIOR TO HIS RETURN TO THE BATTLEFIELD, SHE HAD BECOME HIS WIFE. IT TOOK 6 YEARS TO ELIMINATE HER FROM THE CASE. APPARENTLY, NOTHING THA COULD HAPPEN IN A CASE FAILED TO HAPPEN IN THIS CASE. NO, YOUR HONOR. SINCE THIS CONTES SEEMS TO BE OVER 10% OF THE ESTATE, DIDN'T IT EVER OCCUR TO ANYONE THAT IT MIGHT BE SETTLED AMICABLY BETWEEN THE HEIRS AND THE CHARITY? OH, CERTAINLY, YOUR HONOR. THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TALK OF SETTLEMENT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, ABOUT 4 YEARS AGO, WE WERE ON THE VERGE OF SETTLEMENT WHEN SOMEONE- I KNOW- SOMEONE DIED. NO, YOUR HONOR, NOT THIS TIME. BUT, MOST REGRETTABLY, THE CHARITY BROKE OFF NEGOTIATIONS AND REFUSED TO SETTLE. NO, IT WASN'T THE CHARITY THAT REFUSED TO SETTLE. IT WAS ONE MAN WHO WORMED HIMSELF INTO THE CONTROL OF THE CHARITY - CHARLES BARCLAY. IT'S HE WHO REFUSED TO SETTLE. THE GAYLORD SISTERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO GIVE TO THE CHARITY THE 10% WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN UNDER THE FRENCH WILL, AND WE'RE WILLING TO DO IT NOW. BUT THAT'S NO WHAT THEY WANT. THEY WANT TO PROLONG THIS LITIGATION OVER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE FRENCH WILL WAS VALID OR NOT INDEFINITELY, AND THE MAN WHO IS BEHIND THEM IS CHARLES BARCLAY. AND IF IT HADN' BEEN FOR HIM, THIS CASE WOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED YEARS AGO. I MUST CAUTION YOU, MISS FIONA, YOU'LL ONLY COMPLICATE THE CASE. COMPLICATE IT? OH, DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH! IT'S SO COMPLICATED NOW, I LOOKS LIKE A DISH OF SPAGHETTI. AND JUST HOW DOES MR. BARCLAY ENTER INTO THE LITIGATION? HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION CAN AFFORD THE SERVICES OF AN EXPENSIVE LAWYER LIKE MR. WHEELER? ONLY BECAUSE MR. BARCLAY PAYS THE BILLS. AND WHY DOES MR. BARCLAY PAY THE BILLS? BECAUSE MR. BARCLAY WANTS TO BUY THE GAYLORD HOUSE, TEAR IT DOWN, AND ERECT IN ITS PLACE A HIDEOUS MONUMENT TO HIS VANITY TO BE KNOWN AS BARCLAY SQUARE. AND WHY CAN'T MR. BARCLAY BUY THE GAYLORD HOUSE? BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART OF THE ESTATE WHICH IS IN LITIGATION. I GOT IT DIREC FROM MY GRANDMOTHER. IT BELONGS TO ME... AND A GAYLORD NEVER SELLS THE LAND. YOUR HONOR, IT EMBARRASSES ME THAT A CLIENT OF MINE SHOULD BE GUILTY OF SUCH MISCONDUCT, PARTICULARLY IN YOUR HONOR'S COURT. I CAN ONLY ASK YOUR HONOR'S INDULGENCE ON THE GROUNDS OF THE NERVOUS STRAIN TO WHICH SHE'S BEEN SUBJECTED. AND AS FOR MR. BARCLAY, EVEN IF HE HAS ENGAGED MR. WHEELER TO PROTECT HIS INTERES IN THE BOYS' CLUB, WHY SHOULDN'T HE INTERES HIMSELF IN THIS CHARITY, THE SAME AS HE HAS IN SO MANY OTHERS? TRIPE! MISS FIONA! DON'T WAVE YOUR HANDS AT ME! I WON'T SIT DOWN, AND I WON'T KEEP STILL. YOUR HONOR, FOR OVER 20 YEARS, THIS MESS HAS BEEN GOING ON. WE'VE PRACTICALLY GROWN UP IN COURT. I KNEW WHAT A SUBPOENA WAS BEFORE I COULD SPELL "CAT." THEY'VE WRITTEN BOOKS ABOUT THIS CASE AND TEACH IT AT HARVARD. IT'S AN ANNUAL PERFORMANCE- THE GAYLORD CIRCUS IS COMING TO TOWN! AND WHO PAYS FOR IT? WE DO! WE'VE BEEN LIVING ON OUR EXPECTATIONS, BORROWING ON THEM... UNTIL EVEN THE MONEYLENDERS PULL DOWN THEIR BLINDS WHEN THEY SEE US COMING. IF WE CAN FIND A BUTCHER WHO DOESN'T KNOW US, WE CAN LAS 3 MONTHS LONGER. AND IF THE CASE ISN'T SETTLED BY THEN, I'M GOING TO GIVE THE ESTATE AWAY TO SAVE MY SALVATION AND SHOUT, "HALLELUJAH!" COME ON, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. HALLELUJAH. BUT, MISS FIONA... HALLELUJAH. MISS GAYLORD! DON'T STOP. HEY! STOP THIS ELEVATOR. SORRY, LADY, THIS IS AN EXPRESS. NO STOPS. NO STOPS? NOW YOU'VE DONE IT! IT'S JAMMED. JAMMED?! YOU'VE TRAPPED ME. IF ANY TRAPPING WAS DONE, IT WAS DONE BY YOU. WHAT'S THE MATTER? THE SAFETY'S JAMMED. I GO A NERVOUS DAME DOWN HERE. I'M NOT NERVOUS. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, YOU AIN'T NERVOUS. YOUNG MAN, WHEN WAS THIS LAST INSPECTED? LADY-TRY CLIMBING DOWN ON THE CAGE AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT! I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING! AS UNPLEASANT AS THIS IS FOR BOTH OF US, MISS GAYLORD, NOW THAT WE'RE TRAPPED, AS YOU SAY, SUPPOSE YOU LISTEN TO A LITTLE COMMON SENSE. I HATE COMMON SENSE. IT'S SO COMMON. - TRY HER NOW! - STILL JAMMED! THEY'RE KILLING US! THEY'RE STARTING OUR CASE ALL OVER AGAIN WITH A NEW JUDGE. YOU HEARD YOUR OWN ATTORNEY SAY THAT IT MIGHT TAKE YEARS TO SETTLE THE ESTATE. NOW, I WANT TO BUY THE GAYLORD HOME. OVER MY DEAD BODY. IF NECESSARY. THE GAYLORDS NEVER SELL THE LAND. AW, LADY, SELL IT TO HIM! MR. BARCLAY, WHY ARE YOU SO SET ON BUYING OUR HOUSE? OH, A WHIM, LADY BURTON. A WHIM OF IRON. AND YOU'D BETTER PERSUADE YOUR SISTER TO MAKE A DEAL WITH ME. NOW EASE HER DOWN A BIT! THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE LEFT FOR ANY OF YOU IF SHE KEEPS ON FIGHTING, AND I CAN AFFORD TO KEEP ON FIGHTING INDEFINITELY. WELL, I CAN'T. YOUNG MAN, WILL YOU PLEASE LET ME OUT OF HERE? WHO'S HOLDING YOU? - OH, FIONA, WHY DON'T YOU - SHUT UP! TOM, SHIMMY IT DOWN A BIT! OK! HOLD IT! YOU'D BETTER GET OVER YOUR STUBBORN, STIFF-NECKED PRIDE. LOOK OU SHE DON'T KICK BACK! YOU MUST REMEMBER THERE'S BARCLAY PRIDE, TOO, YOU KNOW. THE GAYLORD GIRLS SEEM TO BE FINDING THAT OUT. TRY HER NOW! OK! SHE'S ACTING ALL RIGHT NOW! OK, GO AHEAD- I'M CLEAR! WHERE'S YOUR CAR? SUSANNA, CALL A TAXI. JUST A MOMENT! FOR 6 MONTHS? YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WALK. I'VE DONE IT BEFORE. AND I THOUGHT WE HAD RUINS IN ENGLAND. I'M COMING, I'M... COMING. SASKIA! WAIT A MINUTE! NEVER GET ANY RES IN THIS... SASKIA! WHEN WE DROVE UP, AUSTIN WAS IN THE FRONT YARD. I TOLD YOU TO KEEP THAT KID INSIDE. YOU FRIGHTEN HIM, FIONA. NO, I DON'T. HE LIKES IT. WHERE DID THE LITTLE NIPPER COME FROM? SASKIA BROUGHT HIM FROM THE COUNTRY. HE'S NO TROUBLE. IS TEA READY? I DIDN'T HAVE TIME. I'LL GIVE YOU 10 MINUTES TO BRING TEA HERE. YOU HAVE NO HEART. NO, I KNOW - ONLY A STOMACH. WELL, EVELYN, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE BACK IN YOUR OLD HOME? LOOKS, UH... WELL, AT LEAS IT SMELLS THE SAME. LIKE THE GAYLORD CASE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TWO HAVE STOOD IT. BELIEVE ME, YOU GET USED TO IT. I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER IF THEY EVER SETTLE CASES IN THIS COUNTRY. GIG! OH, GIG! I SLIPPED AWAY AS SOON AS I COULD. HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO KEEP ON MEETING IN THE PARK LIKE THIS? WELL, UNTIL I TELL FIONA THAT I KNOW YOU. SAY, ARE YOU AFRAID OF HER? A LITTLE. WHAT MAKES HER SO FEROCIOUS? SHE'S HAD PLENTY TO SPOIL HER DISPOSITION- ALL THESE YEARS FIGHTING TO GE ENOUGH MONEY FOR US TO LIVE ON. HOW'D YOUR WORK GO TODAY, GIG? I COULDN'T PAINT A LICK, AND NO WONDER- TRYING TO TURN OUT THE POPULAR CLAPTRAP THE ART DEALERS WANT. I KEPT PAINTING AND PAINTING UNTIL I WAS READY TO DROP. THEN I HATED MYSELF AND ALL ART FOR TRYING TO HIT SOMETHING NO HEEL LIKE ME CAN HIT. SUSANNA, IF I SHOULD ASK YOU TO MARRY ME, DON'T. NONSENSE! I LOVE YOU. I'D SNAP AT THE CHANCE. ASK ME. OH, I'M CHARMING AND BOLD - GOOD COMPANY NOW. I SAY THINGS YOUR OTHER FRIENDS DON'T TALK ABOUT. YOU FEEL THAT I'M A GREAT MAN WHO'S GIFTED- OH, AND MODESTY IS YOUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE, I SEE. ONLY FOOLS ARE MODEST. LOOK, SUSANNA... I COULDN'T FIT INTO YOUR SCHEME OF CIVILIZATION, AND I WARN YOU, EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN ME NOW WILL BE CHANGED IF I MARRY YOU AND TAKE YOU TO LIVE IN MY LITTLE CORNER OF THE WORLD. A FOUL TEMPER... I'M NOT EVEN CIVILIZED, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE. I'VE ALMOST KILLED A COUPLE OF GUYS IN FITS OF RAGE. NO, SUSANNA, DON'T ACCEP ME IF I ASK YOU TO MARRY ME. I SHALL! I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE AN ATTIC AND A FEW CRUSTS OF BREAD WE COULD LIVE ON. NO, I HAVE A HUGE OLD HOUSE ON THE NORTH SHORE, AND I COULD MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY... BUT DON'T MARRY ME. WILL YOU? IS THIS AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE? YES, CONFOUND YOU! DARLING! YOU LITTLE FOOL! I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE KISSED IN THE PARK. I'LL TELL FIONA TONIGHT. DO IT AGAIN. WHY DON'T YOU FIGH BACK? PUNCH HIM IN THE NOSE! I- I CAN'T REACH! THEN KICK HIM IN THE SHIN! OOH! WOW! COME ON, GET UP AND FIGHT! YEAH, YOU OLD COWARD! YOU OLD COWARD! WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU, I THOUGH YOU WAS COMING TO HELP ME. I DID HELP YOU. I TAUGH YOU HOW TO FIGHT BACK. COME ON IN NOW AND WASH YOUR FACE. IF HE EVER COMES HERE AGAIN, I'LL KNOCK HIS BLOCK OFF! WHAT HAPPENED? AUSTIN, WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU?! NOW, NOW, DON' CLUCK OVER HIM. BUT HE'S HURT! HE'S BLEEDING! I CAN'T LEAVE HIM ALONE FOR ONE MINUTE... HA! YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY. THIS IS THE HERO. HE IS WOUNDED, BUT NOT SLAIN. HE WILL LAY HIM DOWN AND BLEED AWHILE, THEN RISE AND FIGHT AGAIN. HUH, AUSTIN? YES, MA'AM. HOW DO YOU LIKE LIVING IN THE CITY? I LIKE THE COUNTRY BETTER. SO DID I. IT'S A TOUGH WORLD. YOU GET TOUGH, LIVING IN THE COUNTRY. THE COWS LOOK TOO KIND. WALKING UP FIFTH AVENUE IS LIKE WALKING THROUGH A JUNGLE. YOU MEAN, LIONS AND TIGERS AND WOLVES? MMM, WITH CLOTHES ON. THERE YOU ARE- YOU'RE A NEW MAN. YOU MEAN, I CAN GO OUT AND FIGHT AGAIN? NOT RIGHT AWAY. I'D TAKE IT EASY FOR A WHILE. WHEW! WHAT FOUL CONCOCTION ARE YOU BREWING THERE, SASKIA? VEGETABLE SOUP. OOH! I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT. IT HAS SPECIAL VITAMINS. NEVER MIND. I'LL GO. GEE, SHE'S SWELL. SHE'S GOT NO HEART, ONLY A STOMACH. SO I CAME DIREC FROM COURT. UH, THESE PAPERS OUGH TO BE SIGNED TONIGHT. THEY'RE JUST ROUTINE BUT, OF COURSE, IF YOU WANT ME TO EXPLAIN- NEVER MIND THE PAPERS. IF YOU'RE IN THE MOOD FOR EXPLAINING THINGS, YOU MIGHT EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN BY HUMILIATING ME IN COURT TODAY. NOW, THEN, MISS FIONA, YOU SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME IN COURT, AND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I THA A MEMBER OF THE BAR MUST GOVERN HIS CONDUCT ACCORDING TO THE RULES AND THE ETHICS OF HIS PROF- RULES, ETHICS, TRIPE! SEE HERE, GIBBON, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN THAT SCHEMING MIND OF YOURS WHEN YOU MADE THA SLOBBERING SPEECH ABOUT CHARLES BARCLAY, BUT IT WASN'T ETHICS! PLEASE, PLEASE, MISS FIONA. I HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR YOU. THAT'S ALL THAT SAVED YOU FROM BEING CITED FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT. OH, NO, NO, GIBBON. YOU HAD SOME OTHER REASON FOR THAT COURTROOM MORATORY AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS! WELL, SINCE YOU'VE DESCENDED TO PERSONALITIES, THIS-THIS DISCUSSION IS WITHOUT PURPOSE. NO LAWYER COULD SIT SILEN IN COURT WHILE HIS CLIENT MAKES SUCH AN UNDIGNIFIED AND VIOLENT ATTACK ON A- ON A MAN OF CHARLES BARCLAY'S POSITION AND IMPOR- SO THAT'S IT! WELL, IF YOU'RE SO ENAMORED OF MR. BARCLAY'S NOBLE MOTIVES, GO AND ASK HIM FOR A JOB! WE CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU! WELL, YOU JUST CAN'T CHANGE LAWYERS OVERNIGHT IN A CASE LIKE- WHY CAN'T I? IT ISN'T DONE. WELL, IT'S BEING DONE RIGHT NOW! YOU SAID YOURSELF WE'D PRACTICALLY STARTED THIS CASE ALL OVER AGAIN WITH A NEW JUDGE! IT'S A FINE TIME TO START I ALL OVER AGAIN WITH A NEW LAWYER! AS A LAWYER - I'VE LET YOU PILFER THIS ESTATE FOR YEARS, LET YOU HAND IN YOUR SWINDLING DEMANDS FOR FEES, BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT ALL YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF US! GIBBON, YOU'RE THROUGH! TAKE YOUR DIRTY, RED, WET FACE OUT OF HERE AND KEEP IT OUT! GET OUT! FIONA! IT'S MINE! WHO'S THAT? MR. GIBBON. HE'S OUR LAWYER. HA HA! HE WAS YOUR LAWYER. OH. WHAT'S ALL THE NOISE ABOUT? WHAT'S HAPPENING? I SAY, ARE WE BEING BLITZED? NO, BUT OUR MR. HERSCHELL GIBBON WAS JUST BLITZED RIGHT DOWN THE FRONT STEPS AND INTO THE GUTTER, WHERE HE BELONGS! SLIMY TOAD WITH HIS LIES AND EVASION, SHINING UP TO CHARLES BARCLAY! TRYING TO FEATHER ANOTHER NEST FOR HIMSELF AFTER HE'S THROUGH FOULING THIS ONE, BUT I PUT HIM IN HIS PLACE! I TOLD HIM WHAT HE COULD DO! TAKE HIS DIRTY, RED, WET FACE OU OF HERE AND KEEP IT OUT FOR GOOD! AND FURTHERMORE, I SAID- I'M GIG YOUNG. YOU, UH, DROPPED THIS. GIG, I'M SORRY. THIS IS MY SISTER, FIONA. GIG YOUNG? AREN'T YOU THAT VERY BAD MODERN ARTIS WHO SMELLED UP THE PLACE PAINTING A PICTURE OF PAPA? RIGHT! FOR THE GAYLORD POST OF THE LEGION. ANYWAY, YOU... KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE. THAT WHAT YOU LIKE? YES. I SUPPOSE YOU'RE THE OTHER SISTER. I KNOW A GAYLORD FACE WHEN I SEE IT- TOO MUCH PRIDE AND JUST THE LEAST BIT SHORTNESS OF THE CHIN. HOW'S ENGLAND? FIGHTING BACK. SAY, WHAT MAKES ALL YOU GAYLORDS SUCH BEAUTIES? PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GAYLORD MALES WENT SLUMMING ONCE IN A WHILE- KEPT VITALITY AND VARIETY IN THE FAMILY. OH, FIONA, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW? WE'LL HAVE TO GE ANOTHER LAWYER. OH, WE'LL GET ONE. NEW YORK'S CRAWLING WITH LAWYERS. LET ME SEE. BARTON RUSS? NO, HE THINKS HE'S CLARENCE DARROW. I KNOW-RALPH PEDLOCH. HE MIGHT BE JUS THE RIGHT MAN. WHY? YEARS AGO, MY DOG BIT HIM. WHAT'S THAT GO TO DO WITH- WELL, HE KNEW I WAS A GAYLORD AND HE DIDN'T SUE ME. I'LL CALL HIM UP. BESIDES, HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A GOOD LAWYER. YES, BUT WOULD A GOOD LAWYER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS FAMILY? WELL, YOU COULD ALWAYS ASK AND THEY CAN ALWAYS SAY NO. I'VE HAD A LO OF FUN THAT WAY. YEAH, I'LL BE YOU HAVE. HEH! SO, YOU'RE AN ARTIST. YOU LOOK MORE LIKE A... FULLER BRUSH MAN. SO YOU'RE LADY BURTON. GO ON. TELL ME WHAT I LOOK LIKE. INCENDIARY BOMB, WITH A MONOCLE. HA HA! WILL YOU HAVE SOME SHERRY? YEAH, IF IT'S NO TOO STRONG. VERY GOOD FACE, YOUR SISTER. PLENTY OF CHARACTER. SOME OF IT'S THE WRONG KIND... COURAGE AND... STUBBORNNESS. WHEN WILL YOU MARRY ME, SUSANNA? NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU. NO, DON'T WORRY YOUR SILLY LITTLE HEAD ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND. YOU KNOW? KNOWN ALL THE TIME. I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH THIS GUY- SAYER ALLEN. HOW COULD A LIVE LITTLE GIRL LIKE YOU MARRY A FRUIT PLATE LIKE THAT? BUT, GIG, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? LOOK, SUGAR, YOU COULD HAVE 100 HUSBANDS. IT WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO ME. WHAT I WANT I TAKE, AND WHAT I TAKE, I LOVE. WHEN YOU GET RID OF THAT HUSBAND OF YOURS, YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY ME AND HAVE 10 CHILDREN - ALL ARTISTS. AND SOMEDAY I'LL BEAT YOU AND YOU'LL THROW CHAIRS AT ME AND WE'LL GO ON BEING JUST FOLKS. WELL, I-I'VE TRIED TO GE THE MARRIAGE ANNULLED... BUT HE WANTS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY. SUPPOSE I MURDER HIM? OH, NO, GIG. I WOULDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF WAITING OUTSIDE PRISON. PLEASE, GIG, YOU'VE FORGOTTEN EVELYN. NO ONE FORGETS EVELYN. LOOK, EVELYN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME? I OFFER TO TAKE A WOMAN AWAY AND GIVE HER LOVE AND LIFE, AND EVERYTHING A WOMAN'S SUPPOSED TO DREAM OF, AND WHAT HAPPENS? SHE SAYS NO! I WOULDN'T. NOBODY ASKED YOU! YOU KNOW, I'D QUITE FORGOTTEN HOW EXCITING AMERICAN MEN CAN BE. GIG, DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU HAD AN APPOINTMENT? OH, YEAH. I GOT TO TORMEN SOME 57th-STREET ART DEALERS. GOOD-BYE, SUSANNA, AND REMEMBER- I'M NOT A PATIENT MAN. PLEASE, GIG. WHAT-EVELYN AGAIN? WELL, I'LL KISS HER, TOO. IT'S ALL IN THE FAMILY. LADIES, I SALUTE YOU. WELL, GIRLS, AT LAST I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. IT'S ABOUT TIME. WE COULD USE SOME. MR. PEDLOCH'S COMING RIGHT OVER. HOORAY FOR THE GAYLORDS! THERE, YOU SEE? I'VE BROUGHT YOU LUCK. DID YOU BRING YOUR GAS MASK, TOO? YES, WHY? PEDLOCH'S GOING TO NEED I WHEN HE OPENS UP OUR CASE. AND THAT'S WHY I HOPE TO GET IT OU OF THE COURTS FOR YOU THIS YEAR. THAT MEANS YOU'LL TAKE OUR CASE? AS A LAWYER, I'M AS HAPPY AS A LYNCHING BEE TO GET IT, BUT THERE'S ONE THING I WANT TO ASK YOU... WHY DOES CHARLES BARCLAY HATE YOU SO? WELL, I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD. WHY DOES HE? WELL, APPARENTLY, HE'S THE MONKEY WRENCH IN THE BUZZ SAW, OR THE FLY IN THE OINTMENT, OR THE COLORED GENTLEMAN IN THE WOODPILE. IS HE? HOW VERSATILE. YOU KNOW, IT MIGHTN' BE A BAD IDEA IF YOU HAD A ROUND-TABLE CONFERENCE. YOU KNOW, GET BARCLAY AND HIS LAWYERS- NO, NO. FIONA, YOU SEEM TO BE ALMOST AFRAID OF BARCLAY- AFRAID?! AFRAID OF THA COUNTRY CLODHOPPER? THAT... THAT... ME GO TO HIM? WHY, IF PAPA WERE ALIVE, HE'D BE COMING TO OUR HOUSE- TO THE BACK DOOR, HAT IN HAND! WELL, IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT BARCLAY, I'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT I CAN DO WITH GILBERT WHEELER. MAYBE I CAN ENLIS HIS SYMPATHIES. WHO IS THIS CHARLES BARCLAY WHO, UH, MAKES EMOTIONS RUN SO HIGH? HE'S A STRANGE MAN- STIRRING BIG CAULDRONS AND NEVER SPILLING A DROP. TELL ME ABOUT HIM. OH, HIS IS A BRILLIANT MIND- A GREAT ORGANIZER'S. PERHAPS HE SEES THE WORLD WE ONCE LOVED IS ENDING. - PERHAPS HE SEES... - EVELYN! THERE'S NO NEED FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. ALL RIGHT, MY DEAR. WELL, MISS GAYLORD, THEY CERTAINLY TOOK YOU GIRLS FOR A RIDE. YES. THEN WE MAY HAVE TO WALK HOME. OH, I THINK I CAN GET YOU A LIFT. I'LL GO TO THE DOOR WITH YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT, LADIES. GOOD NIGHT, MR. PEDLOCH. AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE STEPPING INTO. OH... AS LONG AS I'VE HEARD ALL THE STORY. YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ANYTHING, HAVE YOU? NOTHING ESSENTIAL. WELL, I THINK WE'LL GET SOMEWHERE. OH, BY THE WAY, JUST A WORD OF WARNING- DON'T MAKE GIBBON ANY MORE ANGRY THAN HE IS ALREADY. YES, I KNOW. HE'S A BAD LOSER. YES. DINNER'S READY. I'LL SPREAD THE GLAD TIDINGS. EVELYN, SUSANNA, DINNER. COME AND GET IT. EAT YOUR HAMBURGER. SUSANNA. SUSANNA, YOU'RE IN LOVE. HOW DID YOU KNOW? BY THAT VACUOUS LOOK THE POETS CALL "ECSTATIC." FIONA, I'M GOING TO MARRY GIG YOUNG. MARRY HIM? WHY NOT? ISN'T THERE STILL A LITTLE MATTER OF YOU BEING MARRIED TO SAYER ALLEN? I'M GOING TO FIX THAT UP. SAYER ALLEN IS AFTER YOUR MONEY. HE'LL NEVER GIVE YOU A QUIET ANNULMENT! YOU PROMISED ME YOU'D NEVER DRAG THIS THING INTO A PUBLIC SCANDAL WITH A RENO DIVORCE, SO HOW- WELL, AS SOON AS THE ESTATE IS SETTLED, I'LL BE ABLE TO PAY HIM FOR AN ANNULMENT. HOW CAN YOU GE AN ANNULMENT? IT WAS NEVER A REAL MARRIAGE. I LEFT HIM AFTER 4 HOURS. WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, HE WANTED TO BRING HIS MOTHER ALONG ON THE HONEYMOON. HA HA HA. I'VE HEARD OF THA - TEA FOR 3, EH? BUT, SUSA- DO YOU HAVE TO SPILL EVERYTHING? I DO THE BEST I KNOW. I'M NOT A WAITRESS, I'M A COOK. WHO SAID YOU WERE? I'VE TOLD YOU NOT TO SERVE VEGETABLES SWIMMING IN WATER. WHAT CAN I DO? VEGETABLES ARE MOSTLY WATER, AREN'T THEY? YOU CAN POUR IT OFF. AND LOSE THE VITAMINS? WHAT GOOD ARE VEGETABLES WITHOUT VITAMINS? I HAVE REALLY NO IDEA. SERVE VEGETABLES WITHOUT VITAMINS... HA! CHEERY OLD BUZZARD, ISN'T SHE? FIONA, WHY DO YOU PUT UP WITH HER? BECAUSE SHE PUTS UP WITH ME. PASS YOUR GLASS, EVELYN. WELL! CHATEAU LA TOUR 1913? HEH! I SEE PAPA'S CELLAR IS STILL HOLDING OUT. IT'S THE ONE THING THE LAWYERS OVERLOOKED. FIONA OPENS A BOTTLE EVERY NIGHT. AH! GOOD GIRL, FIONA. THIS BELONGS WITH THE PARTRIDGE AT THE SAVOY. MMM, SO DOES THAT MONOCLE. WHEN DID YOU STAR WEARING THAT THING? AFTER THE FIRS AIR RAID. THE FIRST AIR RAID? I DON'T SEE- KEEPING A THING LIKE THIS WHERE IT BELONGS GIVES YOU SOMETHING TO CONCENTRATE ON - A GRIP ON YOURSELF. HA! I'M SURE YOU DON' KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. OH, BUT I DO. I WISH I HAD SOMETHING LIKE IT. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KEEP A GRIP ON YOURSELF FOR? GIG... EVERY TIME I'M WITH HIM, I TURN TO JELLY. WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE WANTS A HUSBAND, BUT IF YOU LOVE GIG YOUNG, SUSANNA... HERE'S TO HIM AND YOU. WELL! AREN'T YOU GOING TO FINISH YOUR DINNER, FIONA? BETWEEN CHARLES BARCLAY, GIBBON, AND SASKIA, I'VE HAD A STOMACHFUL. BESIDES, I'VE GOT A LOT OF PAPERS I HAVE TO TURN OVER TO PEDLOCH TOMORROW. YOU'VE NEVER READ A LEGAL PAPER THROUGH IN YOUR LIFE! NO, BUT I'M GOING TO READ THESE. I'M GOING TO SIT IN THE BIG CHAIR WITH A BOX OF ASPIRIN, A POT OF COFFEE, AND MR. WEBSTER'S BESTSELLER, KNOWN AS THE DICTIONARY. GOOD NIGHT. STILL THE SAME OLD FIGHTING FIONA. IT'S FOR US. I WONDER IF WE'RE WORTH IT. YOU'RE THE BES JUDGE OF THAT. YOU STILL DON'T LIKE ME, DO YOU, SUSANNA? LOOK, EVELYN, YOU'RE MY SISTER- OH, DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU FROM SPEAKING THE TRUTH, ONLY I THOUGHT AFTER 5 YEARS, YOU MIGHT HAVE CHANGED. AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE CHANGED. HAVEN'T I? DID YOU EVER HEAR OF "THE BOUNCE"? THE WHAT? "THE BOUNCE." YOU LOVE SOMEBODY AND SOMETHING... SOMETHING SILLY HAPPENS. SO YOU THINK YOU'LL FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE, SO, JUST TO GET EVEN, YOU BOUNCE INTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S ARMS. IS THAT WHY YOU MARRIED HAL BURTON? HE WAS SECOND CHOICE. OH, IT'S WORKED OUT FINE. I WAS PROUD OF HIM AND, SNOB THAT I AM, PROUD TO BE CALLED "LADY BURTON." WELL, I'M STILL "LADY BURTON"- THE KID HERSELF, IN PERSON- BUT LOVE... WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE? ENOUGH TO KNOW IT OUGH TO HIT YOU LIKE A BRICK WALL. IS THIS FRIEND OF YOURS, UH, WHAT'S-HIS-NAME- IS HE A GOOD ARTIST? YES... AND YOU KNOW HIS NAME AS WELL AS I DO. COULD HE PAIN A PORTRAIT? NOT YOURS. BECAUSE I WAS THINKING, AFTER ALL, I HAVE GOT A TITLE, NOT THAT IT MATTERS ANYMORE, BUT-HA- THERE ARE STILL FOOLS WHO ARE IMPRESSED BY IT. I THOUGHT HE MIGHT PAINT ME IN MY AMBULANCE CORPS UNIFORM. I COULD SELL IT FOR THE SPITFIRE FUND, YOU KNOW- PORTRAIT OF LADY BURTON, BY GIG YOUNG. THAT IS HIS NAME, ISN'T IT? LOOK, EVELYN... AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER, EVERYTHING I'VE HAD YOU WANTED AND MOST OF THE TIME, YOU GOT IT- MY FAVORITE TOY, THE BOOK I TREASURED, THE DOLL I LOVED BEST. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GE GIG YOUNG AWAY FROM ME. OH, DON'T BE SO RIDICULOUS, SUSANNA! CAN'T A MAN PAINT A PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN WITHOUT IT LEADING TO SOMETHING? NOT WHEN YOU'RE THE WOMAN. I SAW HOW YOU LOOKED AT HIM TODAY. I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN. I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN I COULDN' HAVE A LITTLE HAPPINESS WITHOUT YOU COMING BACK AND SPOILING IT. BUT I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING. NO, BUT YOU WILL, AND THERE'S NO USE TRYING TO STOP YOU! SUSANNA. YOU SHOULDN'T MARRY A MAN YOU CAN'T TRUST. YES, I KNOW! WHEN YOU PUT A CHILD IN A CAGE WITH A MAN-EATING TIGER AND THE TIGER MAULS THE CHILD, YOU SLAP THE CHILD! WHY, SUSANNA, YOU CAT. AND AFTER THAT, MR. BARCLAY, I DISASSOCIATED MYSELF COMPLETELY FROM THE GAYLORD SISTERS. I HEARD THEY FIRED YOU, SEVERAL WEEKS AGO. THAT'S THE STORY THEY TELL AND I HAVEN'T DENIED IT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I - I'VE LEANED OVER BACKWARDS TO AVOID EMBARRASSING THEM IN ANY WAY. I'VE EVEN WAITED ALL THIS TIME BEFORE COMING TO YOU WITH MY PROPOSITION. OH? YOU HAVE A PROPOSITION? I WAS ATTORNEY FOR THE GAYLORD SISTERS FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS- IN FACT, EVER SINCE OLD MR. VAN RENNSAELER DIED. YES? AND I KNOW A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT THE GAYLORD SISTERS THAN THEY SUSPECT. I HAVE NO DOUBT. MR. BARCLAY... SUPPOSE I COULD GIVE YOU CERTAIN INFORMATION WHICH WOULD ENABLE YOU TO BUY THE GAYLORD HOUSE, TEAR IT DOWN, AND COMPLETE YOUR BARCLAY SQUARE PROJECT? YOU HAVE SUCH INFORMATION, MR. GIBBON? I HAVE. AND YOU WISH TO SELL ME THAT INFORMATION, MR. GIBBON? WELL, "SELL" ISN' EXACTLY THE WORD. LET'S SAY I'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU THESE FACTS IN RETURN FOR A FAVOR. OH, I SEE. WELL, MR. GIBBON, BEFORE I ASK YOU WHAT THAT FAVOR IS, I'D WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE INFORMATION WAS SOMETHING I COULD USE, UH, LEGALLY OR ETHICALLY. MR. BARCLAY, WHAT I KNOW CONCERNS A CERTAIN PERSON. AND IF THAT PERSON FOUND OU THAT YOU'D DISCOVERED THIS SECRE AND WERE IN A POSITION TO PUBLICIZE IT, THAT PERSON WOULD DO ANYTHING TO PREVENT SUCH PUBLICITY. IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF WHAT'S LEGAL OR ETHICAL. IT'S A CHANCE TO SETTLE THE ESTATE AND TO MAKE HER AGREE TO YOUR TERMS- MAKE HER AGREE? WELL, NATURALLY, IT'S ONE OF THE SISTERS AND- AND YOU DON'T WANT TO SELL THE INFORMATION, EH? UM... NOT FOR MONEY. I SEE. A- AT THE RATE YOUR HOLDINGS ARE INCREASING, YOUR LEGAL STAFF IS BOUND TO INCREASE, TOO, AND I'D CONSIDER IT A PRIVILEGE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH YOU, TO-TO REPRESENT YOU IN SOME OF THESE MERGERS YOU'RE UNDERTAKING. YES? BOARDROOM. MR. GIBBON, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY OUR DISCUSSION HAS TO BE INTERRUPTED, PARTICULARLY AT THIS POINT. NO, NO. I DON'T MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD GO- THAT IS, IF YOU DON'T MIND WAITING. OH, NOT AT ALL. GLAD TO. WELL, SIT DOWN, WON'T YOU? WELL, THANK YOU. CIGAR, MR. GIBBON? OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND, UH, IF YOU SHOULD GET THIRSTY... JUST HELP YOURSELF. ALL THE COMFORTS OF HOME. I SPEND MANY HOURS HERE, MR. GIBBON. WELL, THIS IS A- OH... I THOUGHT IT WAS- I'M SUSANNA GAYLORD. I SEE... I'M SORRY. I- YOU EXPECTED FIONA. YOU THOUGHT THE MOUNTAIN HAD COME TO MOHAMMED. HMM... I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. YES, YOU SHOULD. MR. BARCLAY, I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO BE CLEVER WITH YOU. I DON'T KNOW HOW. YOU SEE, I'M... I'M THE STUPID ONE OF THE FAMILY. WON'T YOU SIT DOWN? NO, THANK YOU. I- I CAN HANG ON TO MY COURAGE BETTER STANDING UP. AM I SO TERRIFYING? NO, NOT YOU- FIONA. IF SHE KNEW I CAME HERE... MR. BARCLAY, WON'T YOU SEE MY SISTER? CERTAINLY. I'D BE DELIGHTED TO SEE YOUR SISTER. BUT JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BY MY SEEING HER? I'VE MADE HER AN OFFER- A VERY GENEROUS ONE. IT WAS REFUSED- NOT ONCE, BUT 20 TIMES. WELL, I... I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT COME TO SOME SORT OF COMPROMISE. COMPROMISE? WHY... THAT WOULD MEAN THAT ONE OF US WOULD HAVE TO GIVE IN. DID YOU THINK IT WOULD BE YOUR SISTER? NO. YOU THINK IT WOULD BE ME? NOT NOW. I SEE IT'S HOPELESS. YOU AND FIONA WILL GO ON FIGHTING TILL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO THE ESTATE, NOTHING LEFT OF OUR LIVES, NOTHING LEFT OF US. WELL, IT'S A PITY YOUR SISTER CAN'T SEE IT THAT WAY. I THINK SHE DOES, BUT SHE'S TOO PROUD TO CARE. I WAS SILLY TO COME HERE. I... I JUST THOUGHT THAT... I CAN'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT LAW OR SELLING THE GAYLORD HOUSE. THAT-THAT'S JUS A MUDDLE TO ME. ALL I KNOW IS I'M - I'M SO UNHAPPY I WISH I WERE DEAD! OH, COME NOW, MISS SUSANNA. THINGS CAN' BE THAT BAD. OH, BUT THEY ARE! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO- TO BE IN LOVE? HOW'D YOU KNOW? WELL... WHEN A WOMAN IS YOUNG AND PRETTY AND UNHAPPY, IT'S USUALLY LOVE. PLEASE, MR. BARCLAY, DON'T SMILE. I- I CAN'T EXPLAIN ALL THE COMPLICATIONS TO YOU, NOT WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF DISLOYALTY... BUT THIS MAN-I... I LOVE HIM VERY MUCH, AND UNLESS THE CASE IS SETTLED, I'M GOING TO LOSE HIM. YOU MEAN THE SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF YOUR... YOUR ROMANCE DEPENDS ON MONEY? OH, NO! NO, NO THE WAY YOU MEAN! MR. BARCLAY, I... I- I CAN'T EXPLAIN EVERYTHING... BUT... WE GAYLORDS ARE A QUEER LOT. WE LOVE EACH OTHER, SOMETIMES WE HATE EACH OTHER. THERE'S A WILD STRAIN OF BLOOD IN US. SOME OF THE EARLY GAYLORDS WERE PIRATES. SOME OF US ARE PIRATES STILL, WANTING WHAT ISN'T OURS AND TAKING IT. WE'VE BEEN HANDCUFFED TOGETHER THROUGH THIS LAWSUI LIKE THE MAN WHO WAS HANDCUFFED TO A CORPSE! MR. BARCLAY... IF THE CASE ISN' SETTLED SOON... MY LIFE'S GOING TO BE RUINED! WOULD YOU CARE TO SEE IF YOUR SISTER'S AT HOME? OH, THANK YOU. HELLO? HELLO? HELLO? OH, IT'S YOU, AUSTIN. WHAT? I'VE BEEN TO THE ZOO. OH, AT THE ZOO? WELL, WHERE ARE THEY NOW? OH. WELL, WELL, IS MY SISTER FIONA HOME? WELL-WELL, GO FIND SASKIA, THEN. YES, MA'AM. I'LL TELL HER YOU'RE WAITING. NO, NO! DON'T HANG UP, AUSTIN! HELLO? AUSTIN! AUS- OH... HE HUNG UP. WHO? OH, I'VE TOLD THEM NEVER TO LET THAT CHILD ANSWER THE PHONE. YOUR... SISTER'S CHILD? EVELYN? NO, EVELYN DOESN' HAVE ANY CHILDREN. IT'S A LITTLE BOY THAT FIONA BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE COUNTRY. HE'S BEEN STAYING WITH US. I SEE. WELL, PERHAPS IT WASN' SUCH A GOOD IDEA, AFTER ALL. I, UH, ACTED ON IMPULSE- SOMETHING, I MUST SAY, THAT'S RATHER UNUSUAL FOR ME. BUT THEN, TEARS CAN BE VERY PERSUASIVE. WELL, I-I DIDN' MEAN TO CRY. I KNOW. THAT'S WHY IT WAS SO EFFECTIVE. YOU WON'T BE HARD ON THE LITTLE FELLOW? HE... HE IS A LITTLE CHAP, ISN'T HE? HE'S 6. 6? WHY-WHY, THAT'S JUST A BABY. IF FIONA HAD BEEN HOME, YOU'D HAVE GONE TO SEE HER? I MAY YET. JUST ONE THING- I'D LIKE YOU NOT TO MENTION YOUR VISIT HERE. OH, I SHAN'T. I SHAN'T SAY A WORD. YOU KNOW, HEARING YOU TALK ABOUT THIS LITTLE BOY, UH, WHAT'S HIS NAME? AUSTIN. THAT TAKES ME BACK TO MY FIRST CIRCUS. THERE WERE ELEPHANTS AND GIRAFFES AND ALL THE REST OF THEM, BUT YOU KNOW WHA IMPRESSED ME MOST OF ALL? WHAT? THE ACROBATS. BOY, I USED TO DREAM AT NIGH ABOUT WEARING SPANGLED PANTS AND BALANCING ON A TIGHTROPE. YES, I WALKED MANY A TIGHTROPE SINCE, BUT I NEVER GO THE SPANGLED PANTS. WELL, GOOD-BYE, MISS SUSANNA. TRY NOT TO WORRY TOO MUCH. THANK YOU. AFTER ALL, THIS CASE MAY BE OVER MUCH SOONER THAN YOU THINK. YOU WERE SAYING, MR. GIBBON? UH, BEFORE I GO ON, MR. BARCLAY, PERHAPS I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT MY LONG ASSOCIATION WITH THE GAYLORD CASE MAKES MY SERVICES ALMOST INDISPENSABLE. OH, YES, YES. OF COURSE. BUT BEFORE WE DISCUSS THAT, MR. GIBBON... I WANT TO BE SURE THE INFORMATION YOU WISH TO GIVE ME IS REALLY VALUABLE. VALUABLE? I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT IT- AND IT CAN ONLY BE VALUABLE IF IT'S SOMETHING I DON'T ALREADY KNOW. AH, YOU COULDN'T KNOW WHA I HAVE TO TELL YOU. HEH! WHY NOT? WELL, IF YOU'D KNOWN IT, YOU WOULD HAVE USED IT. PERHAPS, PERHAPS NOT... UH, MR. GIBBON, I ASSUME THE INFORMATION YOU WISH TO GIVE ME IS OF A SOMEWHAT, UH, SCANDALOUS NATURE? IF IT WASN'T, I WOULDN'T BE VERY VALUABLE. AND WITH WOMEN, SCANDAL AND SEX ARE NEARLY ALWAYS SYNONYMOUS. IF WE CAN JUST COME TO TERMS, I- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW AND SAVE ALL THIS SPARRING ABOUT. DON'T YOU SEE, MR. GIBBON, I WANT TO BE SURE THAT I'M NOT GOING TO PAY FOR SOMETHING I ALREADY POSSESS. EVEN YOU, AS A LAWYER, MUS KNOW THAT'S BAD BUSINESS, AND I AM A GOOD BUSINESSMAN. THAT'S WHY I'VE COME TO YOU. HAVE YOU COME TO TELL ME THAT FIONA GAYLORD IS THE MOTHER OF A CHILD? HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? OH, I TOO HAVE WAYS OF FINDING THINGS OUT, MR. GIBBON. YOU MEAN TO SAY Y - YOU'VE HAD THIS INFORMATION, AND YOU HAVEN' USED IT? NO, NOT YET. SO YOU SEE, MR. GIBBON, YOU'VE COME TO TELL ME SOMETHING I ALREADY KNOW. JUST A MINUTE, MR. BARCLAY! AFTER ALL, YOU-YOU OWE ME SOMETHING! WELL, IF YOU WISH TO SEND ME A BILL FOR YOUR TIME WASTED... DO YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE?! YES, I THOUGHT WE WEN OVER THAT PRETTY THOROUGHLY. OH, NO, WE HAVEN'T! YOU KNOW VERY WELL THE REASON I WAS CHUCKED OFF THE GAYLORD CASE WAS BECAUSE OF THE WAY I SPRANG TO YOUR DEFENSE IN JUDGE BARROWS' COURT! SURELY, MR. GIBBON, THAT WAS YOUR SENSE OF JUSTICE SPEAKING. AND WHEN WE DO RIGH FOR RIGHT'S SAKE, WE SHOULD NOT EXPEC TO BE REWARDED. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING FURTHER TO DISCUSS, MR. GIBBON. UH, MR. GIBBON IS LEAVING. GLAD TO! IF YOU SHOULD EVER NEED ME, DON'T HESITATE TO CALL ME. GET ME MR. WHEELER ON THE PHONE. AUSTIN! YES, MA'AM? WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE? CHASING A DEER. COME ON DOWN. PICKED A FINE PLACE FOR IT. YOU SMELL OF PEANUTS. UNCLE GIG TOOK ME TO THE ZOO AND WE FED THE BIG MONKEY PEANUTS AND I SORE A GIRAFFE! "SAW." YES, MA'AM. WE HAD POPCORN AND HOT FRANKS AND TWO KINDS OF ICE CREAM! UNCLE GIG FELT MY MUSCLE. HE SAID IT WAS BIGGER THAN AN ERSTER! "OYSTER." YES, MA'AM. I SUPPOSE YOU WERE CHASING A DEER IN THIS ROOM, TOO. YES, MA'AM. IT RAN AROUND THE TABLE. WELL, YOU HELP ME PICK THEM UP. YES, MA'AM. YOU KNOW, AUNT EVELYN GAVE ME A QUARTER, BUT UNCLE GIG WOULDN' LET ME SPEND ANY. YOU MEAN SUSANNA, DON'T YOU? NO, I MEAN AUNT EVELYN- THE ONE WHO SAYS "BLIMEY" AND CALLS ME "NIPPER." WHEN DID YOU STAR THIS "AUNT" BUSINESS? IT WAS UNCLE GIG. HE SAID IT SOUNDED MORE FRIENDLY, LIKE WE WAS RELATIONS OR SOMETHIN'. AM I A RELATION, MISS GAYLORD? IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY. DO PEOPLE READ THESE BOOKS? NO, NOT IF THEY CAN HELP IT. WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO READ-FUNNIES? OH, THEY AIN' - I MEAN, THEY ARE NOT VERY GOOD. I USED TO LIKE 'EM WHEN I WAS LITTLE, BUT NOW I LIKE DANIEL BOONE AND BUFFALO BILL. I REMEMBER BUFFALO BILL COMING TO THIS HOUSE- TO THIS VERY ROOM. YOU MEAN YOU REALLY SAW BUFFALO BILL? I NOT ONLY SAW HIM, HE KISSED ME. BUFFALO BILL KISSING GIRLS! WELL, I WAS ONLY A LITTLE GIRL. WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE? DID HE WEAR HIS BIG WHITE HAT, HERE IN THIS VERY ROOM? YES, HE DID. AND DID HE REALLY HAVE LONG, WHITE HAIR DOWN TO HERE? OH, YES! OH, I REMEMBER IT SO WELL! IT WAS A WINTER DAY AND PAPA- MY FATHER- MM-HMM? INVITED A LO OF FRIENDS FOR DINNER. I WAS SO EXCITED TO BE ALLOWED TO COME. I RAN DOWN THE STAIRS AND WALKED INTO THE ROOM AND THERE WAS PAPA, AND OVER THERE... WAS... BUFFALO BILL. OH, HELLO, FIONA. HELLO, SUSANNA. UM, AUSTIN AND I ARE JUST TIDYING UP. COME ALONG, AUSTIN. THERE ARE A FEW WE DIDN'T GET. NOT SO MANY AT A TIME, AUSTIN. THEY'RE HEAVY. OH, I'M STRONG. UNCLE GIG FELT MY MUSCLE. HE SAID IT WAS BIGGER THAN AN ERSTER-OYSTER! AND YOU LEARN BY YOUR MISTAKES. THAT'S MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR YOUR MOTHER. DID YOU KNOW MY MOTHER? BEFORE YOU WERE BORN. I THINK SASKIA HAS YOUR DINNER READY. YOU BETTER GO DOWNSTAIRS. ALREADY? I KNOW, VITAMINS AND VEGETABLES, VEGETABLES AND VITAMINS. SUSANNA, WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU? NOTHING. YOU LOOK DIFFERENT. I'VE JUST HAD FRESH, PURE AIR. FIONA, DO YOU THINK THIS CASE MIGHT BE SETTLED SOONER THAN WE THINK? OH, I KNOW! YOU'VE BEEN TO A FORTUNE-TELLER. WHAT DID SHE SAY? IT WASN'T A "SHE." ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID HE SAY? THAT IT MIGHT BE SETTLED SOONER THAN WE THINK. HO HO! SUSIE, SUSIE! WHAT A GAYLORD! I'M SORRY IF I TELEPHONED YOU SO LATE, BUT I HAD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. WHAT IS IT? IT'S SOMETHING I WAN TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. COME TO THE LIBRARY. THEY GOT ME OUT OF BED AN HOUR AGO WITH THIS LETTER, TELLING ME SOMETHING THAT YOU AS MY CLIENT SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME FIRST. MISS GAYLORD... WHEN I ENTERED THE PICTURE AS YOUR ATTORNEY, I HAD NO IDEA A SITUATION LIKE THIS WOULD EVER ARISE. BUT IT HAS, AND I AM YOUR ATTORNEY. AT LEAST, FOR THE PRESENT. NOW I MUST HAVE THIS WHOLE STORY, TRUTHFULLY, FROM START TO FINISH. NOT NOW. NOT TONIGHT. CAN YOU BE AT MY OFFICE THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING? YES. VERY WELL. OF COURSE, I SHOULD BE VERY ANGRY WITH YOU, BUT YOU'VE GONE THROUGH A GREAT DEAL, AND YOU'RE A WOMAN. YES... THAT'S WHAT GOT ME INTO ALL MY TROUBLE. GOOD NIGHT. SUSANNA! EVELYN! WHAT IS IT? COME OUT HERE. EVELYN, EVELYN. YES, FIONA. WHAT IS IT, FIONA? COME INTO MY BEDROOM, PLEASE. SISTER HAS A BEDTIME STORY TO TELL YOU. OH, GOOD. I LOVE BEDTIME STORIES. MUST BE IMPORTANT- IT IS. GET INTO BED. IT'S RATHER CHILLY. YOU MAY AS WELL KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE CHOICE, JUICY SCANDAL BREAK OVER OUR HEADS. WHAT KIND OF A SCANDAL? ABOUT AUSTIN'S MOTHER. WHO IS SHE? I AM. WHO'S THE FATHER? CHARLES BARCLAY. CHARLES BARCLAY? NO! OH, I WISH YOU WERE RIGHT. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I WAS 21 AND I SUDDENLY GOT MY HANDS ON SOME MONEY- THE MONEY THA ENABLED YOU, EVELYN, TO GO TO EUROPE AND GET MARRIED? YEAH. AND THE MONEY THAT GAVE YOU YOUR DEBUT, SUSANNA? OUR GREAT-AUNT SOPHRONIA DIED AND LEFT $100,000 TO BE GIVEN ME THE DAY I GOT MARRIED. WE WERE STILL LIVING LIKE GAYLORDS IN THOSE DAYS, AND WE NEEDED THAT MONEY- WE HAD TO HAVE IT. REMEMBER COUSIN WILLIE, THE PIMPLY-FACED KID WHO WAS ALWAYS CRAZY ABOUT ME? WELL, I THOUGH I COULD MARRY HIM, GIVE HIM $25,000 OF THE $100,000, AND CALL IT A DAY. I MADE OLD VAN RENNSAELER ADVANCE ME THAT MUCH, AND I STARTED FOR VERMONT. HEY! WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? WOODLAND. ISN' THIS THE WAY? NOT OVER THIS BRIDGE. HEY! HEY, IDIOT! DON'T GO BACK OVER THAT PAVING- NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO MY ASPHALT. YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO HOLD ME UP? IF I FINISHED IN TIME, I WAS GOING TO GET A BONUS. BUT YOU HA- I'M SO SORRY. HA HA! OH, WHY, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S A PRETTY LITTLE BRIDGE. AND SUDDENLY, HE GOT THAT SPANIEL LOOK IN HIS EYES. THE WAY SNOOKY USED TO LOOK WHEN HE SAW HIS DINNER, AND I GOT AN IDEA. I TOLD HIM A FANTASTIC STORY OF HUNTING FOR A QUIET LITTLE PLACE TO STOP FOR A FEW DAYS' REST- THAT I WAS JUST RECOVERING FROM THE LOSS OF A DEAR ONE, AND THAT I THOUGHT TIME, THE GREAT HEALER, WOULD COME TO MY RESCUE A LITTLE QUICKER WITH MOTHER NATURE AT HIS SIDE. WELL, HE KNEW JUS THE PLACE FOR ME TO STAY, A FARMHOUSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH TOOK A FEW PAYING GUESTS. BEFORE YOU COULD SAY "KNIFE," HE HOPPED INTO THE CAR BESIDE ME TO SHOW ME THE WAY. HE TOLD ME SPINNING THE TIRE IN THA HOT ASPHALT HADN'T DONE IT ANY GOOD. HE'D CHANGE IT. BUT HE DIDN'T WANT ME STANDING ABOUT IN THE HOT SUN. WE WERE VERY CLOSE TO THE FARMHOUSE, AND THERE WAS A SHORTCU THROUGH THE MEADOW. THEN HE GOT THA SPANIEL LOOK AGAIN. HE'D HAVE TO CARRY ME ACROSS THE BROOK. I... SHYLY AGREED. HE PROMISED HE'D BE VERY CAREFUL. THOSE STEPPING STONES, AND ME WITH MY SOFT LITTLE ARMS ABOUT HIS STRONG, SUNBURNED NECK, AND HIS MANLY HEART POUNDING AGAINST THAT HONEST LEATHER JACKET... BY THIS TIME, I WAS SOLD ON MY IDEA. WHY GO CHASING ALL THE WAY UPSTATE AFTER PIMPLE-FACED COUSIN WILLIE WHEN I HAD A MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE SAP FOR MY PURPOSE CLOSER AT HAND? I SAID TO MYSELF, "HE'S JUST A COUNTRY BUMPKIN FULL OF ROMANTIC IDEAS. "A FEW DAYS OF BUCOLIC LOVEMAKING, "A FEW MOONLIGHT NIGHTS, "AND I'LL HAVE A RING ON ONE HAND AND AUNT SOPHRONIA'S MONEY IN THE OTHER." THE EVENINGS I SPEN ON THAT FRONT PORCH WITH HIM TRYING TO HOLD MY HAND! BUT I WAS FULL OF GIRLISH MODESTY AND PLAYED HARD-TO-GET. AND IF YOU THINK THAT WAS EASY, YOU SHOULD TRY TO BE GIRLISH AND SEDUCTIVE AT THE SAME TIME. I WALKED OVER AND SAT DEMURELY IN THAT HIDEOUS ROCKING CHAIR, WHICH NOT ONLY SQUEAKED, BUT HAD HORSEHAIR IN THE SEAT. HE ROSE TO THE BAI LIKE A TROUT GOING UPSTREAM. HE LEANED OVER THE RAILING AND TOOK MY HAND AGAIN. AND I WAS ABOU TO LET HIM KISS ME... WHEN THE FARMER'S GRANDDAUGHTER CAME OUT AND BROKE THE SPELL. I THREW HIM A SOFT AND PLEADING LOOK AND ROSE INVITINGLY TO MY FEET, AS IF TO SAY THAT THE MOMENT BETWEEN US WAS TOO SACRED TO BE SHARED WITH ANYONE, AND I LURED HIM OFF THE PORCH OUT TOWARDS THE APPLE ORCHARD. THE SETTING WAS PERFECT. A STICKY FULL MOON AND ME IN A TRAILING CHIFFON DRESS. A STALWART, SILENT HERO AT MY SIDE. I EXPECTED AT ANY MOMENT TO HEAR AN ORCHESTRA STRIKE UP AND THE TENOR SING A SOLO. YOU KNOW, APPLE BLOSSOMS, MOONLIGHT, AND YOU. WE WALKED UNTIL I THOUGHT HE WOULDN' HAVE STRENGTH ENOUGH LEFT TO PROPOSE. SO I PICKED OUT THE BIGGES AND JUICIEST APPLE TREE AND PARKED MYSELF UNDER IT. I KNEW THE GREAT MOMEN WAS AT HAND. I PUSHED THE GUY ASIDE SO THE MOONLIGH STRUCK MY FACE AT JUST THE RIGHT ANGLE. AND WHEN HE FINALLY SAID, "WILL YOU MARRY ME," I HUNG MY HEAD, COUNTED 10, AND SHYLY WHISPERED, "YES." I'LL NEVER FORGET THE STINK OF THOSE APPLE BLOSSOMS! YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME AS A BRIDE. I WAS TERRIFIC. THE PICTURE OF INNOCENT MAIDENHOOD. STANDING WITH RELUCTANT FEE WHERE THE BROOK AND RIVER MEET. AND AS FOR MY COSTUME, I WENT THE WHOLE HOG. WHITE SATIN DRESS, MISTY WEDDING VEIL, SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW, SOMETHING BORROWED, AND SOMETHING BLUE. I EVEN WORE 3 PETTICOATS TO PUT ME IN THE MOOD. WITH THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY SAFELY OVER, I STARTED TO WORK UP TO MY BIG ACTING SCENE. I HAD LAIN AWAKE NIGHTS FIGURING IT ALL OUT. WITH CHARLES BARCLAY IT WOULD BE SO SIMPLE. HE THOUGHT ALL WOMEN WERE INNOCENT ANGELS. SO I SUDDENLY HAD AN ATTACK OF THE "VAPORS," AS OUR VICTORIAN GRANDMOTHERS USED TO CALL THEM. I MOANED, GASPED, AND FLUTTERED. I PRETENDED TO BE A LITTLE FAINT AND, FULL OF APOLOGIES AND REGRETS, GOT UP FROM THE TABLE, SWAYED WEAKLY, AND THEN I-I TOTTERED TOWARDS THE STAIRS. THERE I HESITATED AND DRAPED MYSELF OVER THE BANISTER LIKE MONDAY'S WASH. I TOOK A PEEK AND SAW THA HE WAS FOLLOWING ME. I MADE A BRAVE EFFOR TO RECOVER MYSELF BUT SWOONED IN HIS ARMS. KATHARINE CORNELL COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT BETTER. HE CARRIED ME UPSTAIRS TO THE BRIDAL SUITE AND LAID ME DOWN ON THE BED LIKE A LILY AND KNELT BESIDE ME. THEN I THOUGHT, "GREAT HEAVENS, HOW WILL I GET RID OF HIM?" WITH A TERRIFIC EFFORT, I MANAGED TO LE MY EYELIDS FLICKER OPEN AND MURMUR FAINTLY THAT IF HE'D ONLY GET ME SOME SEL VOLATILE FROM THE VILLAGE DRUGSTORE, THAT I'D HAD ATTACKS LIKE THIS OCCASIONALLY, WHEN MY EMOTIONS WERE DEEPLY STIRRED. ONE LAST CONNUBIAL KISS, AND MY ROMEO WAS OFF TO THE DRUGSTORE. I FIGURED IT WOULD TAKE HIM HALF AN HOUR TO GET TO THE VILLAGE AND BACK, AND IN THAT TIME, I'D BE DRESSED, CHANGED, AND ON MY WAY. I GOT THE MONEY OUT OF THE SUITCASE, THE RING OFF MY FINGER, AND I PUT IT IN AN ENVELOPE WITH A LETTER I'D WRITTEN THE NIGHT BEFORE, TELLING HIM HE HAD A WIFE IN NAME ONLY, AND WHY. I MADE THE EXPLANATION AS TACTFUL AS I COULD. IT WASN'T EXACTLY THE SORT OF THING AN EAGER BRIDEGROOM IS WAITING TO HEAR ON HIS WEDDING NIGHT. I WAS JUST READY TO SNEAK OUT WHEN- IT'S $25,000. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. YOU'RE, AH, GOING TO KEEP IT? YES. AND YOU'RE GOING TO LET ME LEAVE YOU? YES. DIVORCE YOU? YES. BUT YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO LET ME LEAVE YOU. I AM. WHEN? TOMORROW. AND DON'T SCREAM. I'M YOUR HUSBAND. HA HA HA! OH, MY DARLING SPINSTER SISTER, HOW YOU'VE BEEN HAD. OH, EVELYN! STOP! BUT CHARLES BARCLAY WILL NEVER KNOW THAT CHILD IS HIS. NOW, MY GIRL, LE THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU NOT TO GO RUNNING AROUND THE COUNTRY DECEIVING STRANGE MEN. DON'T YOU SEE YOU WRONGED HIM? YOU TOOK HIS LOVE AND TRUS AND TRAMPLED THEM IN THE MUD. HE WAS THE VILLAGE MAID AND YOU'RE THE CITY SLICKER. I DON'T SEE THA IT WAS SO WRONG. HE GOT $25,000. WAS THAT THE MONEY THAT HE USED TO WIN HIS WAY TO FAME AND FORTUNE? YES. GRABBED THE GIRL, GRABBED THE MONEY, WHIRLED AWAY ON A ROLLS-ROYCE AND LEFT YOU WITH THE BABY BUGGY. NOW, WHY SHOULD YOU TWO GET ALL THE EXCITING MEN? FIONA, THERE'S SOMETHING I OUGHT TO TELL YOU. I WONDER HOW BARCLAY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW. IT MAY HAVE BEEN GIBBON. THAT MAY BE WHY HE THREATENED ME. I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT. WELL, HE CAN' PROVE ANYTHING. FIONA, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH AUSTIN ALL THIS TIME? HE'S ONLY BEEN HERE 3 MONTHS. KEPT HIM IN WOODLAND WITH MISS COPELAND. OUR OLD NURSE. SHE TOOK AUSTIN AS SOON AS HE WAS BORN. I MEANT NEVER TO SEE HIM AGAIN. AS LONG AS I COULD FORGET THE CHILD, I COULD FORGET TO WHOM THE CHILD BELONGED. AND WHATEVER MADE YOU BRING HIM HERE? I HAD TO. COPEY DIED. THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE I COULD TRUST. THE CHILD HAD TO COME HERE SO THAT I STUMBLED OVER HIM AT EVERY TURN. THAT FUNNY LITTLE FACE PEEKING AT ME, REMINDING ME. YOU SAY THA I FRIGHTEN HIM. WELL, MAYBE I DO. MAYBE I WANT TO FRIGHTEN HIM. MAYBE I WANT TO KEEP HIM AWAY FROM ME, MAYBE I- YOU TWO BETTER GO TO BED! I'VE GOT A LO OF THINKING TO DO BEFORE I FACE PEDLOCH IN THE MORNING. WOULDN'T IT BE IRONIC IF BARCLAY SHOULDN'T ACCEPT HIM AS HIS OWN SON? HE'LL NEVER KNOW. BUT I TELL YOU I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT THE BOY AS MY SON. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? MR. CHARLES BARCLAY IS WILLING TO SHARE THE BOY'S UPBRINGING AND TIME WITH HIS MOTHER. WE APPRECIATE THAT. I KNOW THE CHILD IS YOURS. IF MISS FIONA GAYLORD IS STILL NOT WILLING TO ADMIT THA THE CHILD IS HERS, THEN MY CLIENT HAS NOTHING LEFT TO DO BUT TO GO TO COURT. YOU'LL HAVE TO PROVE IT FIRST. WE WILL PROVE IT, IN COURT, AFTER A GREAT SCANDAL. AUSTIN ISN'T MY SON AND HE ISN'T YOUR SON, AND THE WHOLE THING IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. AS LONG AS MISS GAYLORD IS OPPOSED TO ANY COMPROMISE, I SUPPOSE WE'LL HAVE TO RECONCILE OURSELVES TO LITIGATION. IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO LITIGATE. WE MUST REMEMBER THAT CHARLES BARCLAY HAS FAILED TO SUPPORT HIS CLAIM. NATURALLY. WHATEVER WE MAY HAVE IN THE WAY OF PROOF WILL BE PRODUCED AT THE PROPER TIME. THIS IS MY LAS APPEAL TO YOU. FROM NOW ON, IF YOU DON'T LET REASON DECIDE, THERE'LL BE NOTHING BUT RUIN FOR YOU AND YOUR SISTERS. AND IN THE END, I'LL GET THE BOY. IF YOU'RE READY TO GO, CHARLES. YES. FIONA. DON'T DO ANYTHING MAD. PLEASE. GOOD-BYE, MR. PEDLOCH. GOOD-BYE, MR. BARCLAY. SORRY WE GOT NOWHERE WITH THIS DISCUSSION, PEDLOCH. GUESS I HAD THE WRONG IDEA. HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF US. I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE MUCH TO GO ON. I KNOW GILBERT WHEELER. IF HE'D HAD A TRUMP CARD, HE'D HAVE PLAYED IT. THE ONLY TRICK THEY HAVE IS THE ONE FACT THA YOU WERE MARRIED TO CHARLES BARCLAY. THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE CAN PROVE HE'S AUSTIN'S FATHER. HE DOESN'T NEED TO. WHAT? HE ONLY NEEDS TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE THE MOTHER. I DON' UNDERSTAND. WELL, YOU SHOULD KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT LAW BY NOW, MISS GAYLORD. LEGITIMACY CANNOT BE QUESTIONED WHEN A CHILD IS BORN IN WEDLOCK. IS THAT CLEAR? NO. WELL, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY. IF YOU ARE THE MOTHER OF A CHILD, AND IF THAT CHILD IS BORN DURING A PERIOD WHEN CHARLES BARCLAY COULD HAVE BEEN ITS FATHER, THE COURT, ANY COURT, WILL ACKNOWLEDGE HIS CLAIMS. I DIDN' KNOW THAT. NO ONE EVER TOLD ME. COULD CHARLES BARCLAY HAVE KNOWN WHEN THE CHILD WAS BORN? NO. OR WHERE THE CHILD WAS BORN? NO. YOU'RE POSITIVE HE HAS NO PROOF WHATSOEVER OF THESE ACCUSATIONS? HE OR GIBBON? POSITIVE. IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO PROVE ANYTHING. THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMB THE RECORDS OF EVERY COUNTY SEAT IN THE COUNTRY. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW UNDER WHAT NAME THE CHILD'S BIRTH WAS REGISTERED. I SEE. VERY WELL. I'LL TELEPHONE WHEELER THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND TELL HIM THE BURDEN OF PROOF RESTS ON THEM. OUR CASE IS CLEAR. THERE SHE IS! HERE, TAKE THIS. AND ONE THING MORE, YOUR HONOR. AS A DESCENDENT OF PENN GAYLORD, THE CHILD AUSTIN MAY, UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS WILL, HAVE AN INTERES IN THIS ESTATE. AND I THINK THAT THE PARENTAGE OF THIS CHILD SHOULD BE DETERMINED, AND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SPECIAL GUARDIANS APPOINTED BY THE COURT TO REPRESENT HIS INTERESTS. AND I MIGHT ADD THA MY CLIENT HAS MADE EVERY EFFOR TO EFFECT AN AGREEMENT WITH MRS. FIONA BARCLAY THAT WOULD AVOID A PUBLIC HEARING. IT HAS BEEN HIS HOPE THAT A SETTLEMENT MIGHT BE REACHED. THAT WOULD BE VERY DESIRABLE IF THERE IS A CHANCE FOR AGREEMENT. THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF THAT, YOUR HONOR. THEN MR. WHEELER, YOU MAY AS WELL PROCEED WITH YOUR EVIDENCE. THEN I'LL CALL THE FIRS WITNESS: MR. FRED SIMMONS. YOU SOLEMNLY SWEAR TO SPEAK THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH SO HELP YOU GOD? I DO. WILL YOU GIVE YOUR FULL NAME, PLEASE? FREDERICK CLAUSSON SIMMONS. RESIDENCE? WOODLAND, VERMONT. OCCUPATION? COUNTY CLERK SINCE 1928. NOW I'LL ASK IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY THIS CERTIFIED PHOTOSTAT. THIS IS A COPY OF PAGE 237. "REGISTER OF BIRTH, FRANKLIN COUNTY, 1935." I CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO AN ENTRY SHOWING THE BIRTH OF ONE AUSTIN COPELAND, FEBRUARY 23, 1935. WILL YOU READ THA ENTRY TO THE COURT? "NAME OF CHILD: AUSTIN COPELAND. MALE. "PLACE OF BIRTH: WOODLAND, VERMONT. "MOTHER'S NAME: PENELOPE COPELAND. FATHER'S NAME: UNKNOWN." THAT PROVES NOTHING! CAN YOU TESTIFY THA THAT'S A TRUE COPY OF THE ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE? YES, SIR. COPIED IT MYSELF. OFFER THIS IN EVIDENCE, EXHIBIT "A". SO ADMITTED. ANY CROSS-EXAMINATION? NO QUESTIONS. THAT WILL BE ALL, THANK YOU. DR. THOMAS BIGELOW. BUT AM I TO UNDERSTAND, DR. BIGELOW, THAT YOU CAN RECALL THE CASE, BUT YOU CANNO RECALL THE PATIENT? WHEN I WAS SUMMONED FROM NEW YORK FOR THIS CASE, I KNEW NOTHING BEYOND THE FAC THAT IT WAS AN EMERGENCY AT THE MATERNITY HOSPITAL. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE NAME OF THE PATIENT AFTER I ARRIVED THERE. SHE WAS ALREADY IN THE OPERATING ROOM AND UNDER COMPLETE ANESTHETIC WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS AFTER MY ARRIVAL. AS SOON AS I HAD THE CHILD SAFELY DELIVERED AND THE MOTHER RESTING COMFORTABLY, I HAD TO RETURN TO NEW YORK. THE ONLY FACT I CAN TESTIFY TO IS THAT I DID DELIVER A MALE INFAN ON THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 23, 1935, AT WOODLAND. AND WHEN I RECEIVED A CHECK FOR MY SERVICES, IT WAS SIGNED WITH THE NAME OF COPELAND. THAT IS ALL YOU KNOW, DR. BIGELOW? THAT IS ALL. ANY CROSS-EXAMINATION? NO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU, DOCTOR. MISS IDA ORNER. I'VE BEEN WITH THE WOODLAND HOSPITAL FOR 23 YEARS. AND IT WAS ON THE NIGH OF FEBRUARY 23, 1935, AS THE RECORDS SHOW, AND AS I REMEMBER, BECAUSE IT WAS THE NIGHT OF THE DAY THAT I FIRST TOOK GAS IN THE DENTISTS' OFFICE. OLD DR. OLMSBY, STILL PRACTICING. WELL... A CASE CAME IN IN LABOR, AND DR. RANSOM SAID THERE WERE COMPLICATIONS, AND HE'D SENT FOR A NEW YORK SPECIALIST. AH, DR. BIGELOW, WHO JUST LEFT THE STAND. DO YOU REMEMBER THE PATIENT? OH, I SHOULD SAY I DO. WE HAD OUR HANDS FULL WITH THAT REDHEAD. WOULD YOU KNOW THE PATIEN AGAIN IF YOU SAW HER? I SHOULD SAY I WOULD. MISS ORNER, WOULD YOU LOOK ABOUT THIS COURTROOM AND TELL ME IF THE WOMAN WHOM YOU KNEW AS PENELOPE COPELAND IS PRESENT? I'LL DO MY BEST. I THINK THAT'S HER SITTING THERE AT THE TABLE. ARE YOU SURE? I'D BE SURER IF SHE HAD HER HAT OFF. MR. PEDLOCH. WOULD YOU ASK YOUR CLIENT TO STAND UP AND REMOVE HER HAT? THAT'S THE ONE ALL RIGHT. THERE COULDN'T BE TWO LIKE HER. I HOPE IT'S ON THE LEVEL THIS TIME. I THINK SHE'S COMING TO NOW, SIR. THEN WE DON'T NEED TO CALL A DOCTOR? NO, IT'S ONLY A FAINT. I'VE HAD LOTS OF EXPERIENCE WITH THEM, ESPECIALLY IN BREACH OF PROMISE AND DIVORCE CASES. WELL THEN, I'LL BE GETTING BACK TO THE COURTROOM, AND YOU'LL CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME. YES, SIR. THANK YOU. THERE NOW, DEAR. FEELING BETTER? I THINK SO. THERE. I WONDER, COULD... COULD SOMEONE PLEASE GET ME SOME BLACK COFFEE? WELL, SURE THEY COULD, AND THE BES THING FOR YOU. I'LL GET IT MYSELF. PIPING HOT. OH! AH AH! NOW YOU JUST LIE THERE NICE AND COMFORTABLE, AND I WON' BE A MINUTE. FIFTH AVENUE! I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH. IF CHARLES BARCLAY THINKS HE'S GOING TO MARCH IN HERE WITH A COUR ORDER AND TAKE THIS BOY AWAY, I'M GOING TO SPOIL HIS PLEASURE. ONCE YOU GET AUSTIN OU TO GIG'S PLACE, WE'RE SAFE. NO ONE WILL EVER SUSPECT HE'S THERE. I'M GLAD YOU THOUGHT OF IT. I HOPE GIG LIKES CHILDREN. HE LIKES ME. HE FELT MY MUSCLE, AND HE SAID IT WAS BIGGER THAN AN ER- YES, I KNOW. ERSTER. OYSTER. NOW, LISTEN, AUSTIN. YOU'RE TO STAY INSIDE UNLESS YOU'RE WITH UNCLE GIG, AND DON'T TELL ANYONE YOUR NAME. NO, MA'AM. YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME THERE, MUCH BETTER THAN YOU DO HERE. BUT I HAVE A GOOD TIME HERE. YOU DO? SURE, I DO. I LIKE IT FINE. HURRY UP. MISS GAYLORD, SASKIA SAYS YOU HAVE NO HEART, ONLY A STOMACH. COME ON. QUICK! GO OU THROUGH THE COURTYARD. YOU CAN GET A TAXI AT THE SIDE STREET. SASKIA, LET ME GE INTO THE LIBRARY FIRST, THEN ANSWER THE BELL. ARE YOU QUITE SURE YOU'RE WELL ENOUGH TO SEE US? OH, I'M ALL RIGHT NOW, THANK YOU. I'M SORRY TO HAVE CAUSED SO MUCH TROUBLE. I BROUGH MR. BARCLAY AND MR. WHEELER WITH ME. I'M AFRAID WE HAVE SOME RATHER BAD NEWS FOR YOU. BAD NEWS IS NOT EXACTLY A NOVELTY TO ME, MR. PEDLOCH. I HAVE A COURT ORDER. FOR MY SON. I'VE BEEN EXPECTING THAT. AND I'VE COME TO TAKE HIM. I'VE BEEN EXPECTING THAT, TOO. AND YOU INTEND TO COMPLY WITH IT? YES. YES. YOU'RE GOING TO LET ME TAKE HIM? OF COURSE YOU MAY TAKE HIM... IF YOU CAN FIND HIM. WHERE IS HE? WELL, YOU SEE, THIS IS A VERY OLD HOUSE, AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED, AND WE'RE TERRIBLY TROUBLED WITH RATS. SO THERE'S A MAN, I BELIEVE HE'S CALLED THE PIED PIPER OF HAMLIN-YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM. AND HE CAME HERE AND PLAYED A LOVELY LITTLE TUNE ON HIS PIPES. AND AUSTIN HEARD HIM AND FOLLOWED THE PIED PIPER RIGHT OUT OF THE HOUSE BEFORE I COULD STOP HIM. YOU KNOW HOW LITTLE BOYS ARE. OH, I FORGOT. YOU HAVEN'T ANY CHILDREN. I HAVE A SON. YES? YOU REALIZE THA WHAT YOU'RE DOING CONSTITUTES CONTEMPT OF COURT? BUT I'M DOING NOTHING. YOU KNOW WHERE THAT CHILD IS. NO, NOT A THE MOMENT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS, PEDLOCH? IF I MAY HAVE A FEW MINUTES WITH MY CLIENT, ALONE. I CAME HERE PREPARED TO BE GENEROUS, BUT YOU'VE MANAGED TO KILL THAT DESIRE, ALONG WITH EVERY OTHER DECEN IMPULSE I'VE EVER FELT FOR YOU. HATE IS THE THING YOU THRIVE ON, AND IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, THAT'S WHA YOU'RE GOING TO GET. COME ON. YOU KNOW WHERE THAT CHILD IS. OF COURSE I DO. I'VE BEEN VERY PATIEN WITH YOU, MISS GAYLORD, AND I KNOW BY NOW HOW USELESS IT IS TO ARGUE WITH YOU. SO I'M GOING TO BE VERY FRANK. I WON'T BE A PARTY TO A CONSPIRACY. EITHER YOU GET THAT CHILD BACK HERE BY TOMORROW, OR YOU GET YOURSELF ANOTHER LAWYER. WHY ARE YOU SO RESTLESS? STOP PACING LIKE A TIGER IN THE ZOO OR SOMETHING. BUT IT'S RATHER NEW FOR ME TO HAVE A FAMILY. LET ME GET USED TO MY EMBITTERED EXISTENCE IN MY OWN WAY. WELL! ISN'T THAT NECK JUST A WEE BIT TOO LONG? IT'S A GIRAFFE'S NECK. GIRAFFES HAVE VERY LONG NECKS. OH, I SEE. DO YOU LIKE TO PAINT, AUSTIN? YES, SIR, UNCLE GIG. I DRAW, TOO. YOU BET YOU DO! I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO. WHAT? WE'LL GET A COLOR BOX, AND WE'LL PAINT A PICTURE TOGETHER. THEN WE'LL HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD PAINTINGS, HUH? LOOK AT YOUR FACE! WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? IT'S FILTHY! GO AND WASH IT, AND YOUR HANDS, TOO. AND MIND YOU, GET ALL THE PAINT OFF. I WILL, AUNT EVELYN. WHY DON'T YOU PAY YOUR BILLS SOMETIME? YOU SHOULD TALK. THE GAYLORDS HAVEN' PAID A BILL IN 20 YEARS. OH, WE'VE MANAGED TO SURVIVE. AND SO WILL I. WHERE'S MY PORTRAIT? I DON'T SEE IT ANYWHERE. I PAINTED OVER IT. YOU DIDN'T. SURE I DID. WHY? WELL, THERE'S NO USE WASTING GOOD CANVAS. DID YOU LOSE INTEREST OR, AH, DID YOU FIND A BETTER MODEL? WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? WHAT AM I BURIED UNDER? BROOKLYN BRIDGE ON A FOGGY MORNING. WELL! IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER SEEN THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE WITH BLUE EYES AND A GAYLORD CHIN ON A FOGGY MORNING! NOSY DAME, AREN'T YOU? SO YOU'RE NO GOING TO FINISH IT. NO. COWARD. I'VE MISSED THOSE SITTINGS, GIG. WHY DID YOU STOP? BECAUSE I DIDN'T INTEND TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU. BUT YOU WANTED TO. THAT'S MY BUSINESS. YOU REMEMBER THAT? DANCE WITH ME? NO, THANKS. OH, WELL. YOU'RE PROBABLY A ROTTEN DANCER, ANYWAY. YOU KNOW VERY WELL I'M A GREAT DANCER, AND I DANCE AS I DO EVERYTHING ELSE, WITH DASH, VERVE, AND ORIGINALITY. THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. AUNT EVELYN! LOOK, AUNT EVELYN. DIDN'T I WASH QUICK? YES. YES, AUSTIN, YOU DID. A MINUTE LONGER MIGH HAVE BEEN TOO LATE. CHARLES BARCLAY, STANDING HERE SO SMUGLY WITH HIS COURT ORDER, THREATENING ME, TELLING ME WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO. WELL, I'LL DEFY HIM AND THE COURT- BLAST THEM ALL TO BLAZES-BU I WON'T SACRIFICE MY PRIDE! FIONA, TRY- WOODLAND-HOW DID I KNOW HE'D REMEMBER WOODLAND? DIGGING UP OLD COPEY. IT'S EASY TO SEE HOW HE GOT AHEAD. I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO. THE MOMEN EVELYN GETS BACK- SHE WON'T BE BACK. WHY NOT? IF GIG'S THERE, SHE WON'T BE BACK. OH, WHAT'S GIG GOT TO DO WITH IT? OH, FIONA, HOW COULD YOU SEND EVELYN OUT THERE, GIVE HER THAT CHANCE? HOW COULD YOU, FIONA? I DON'T KNOW WHA YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. DON'T YOU KNOW SHE'S MAD ABOUT GIG? DON'T YOU KNOW SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO TAKE HIM AWAY FROM ME EVER SINCE SHE CAME HERE? GIG AND EVELYN? YOU'RE CRAZY. NO, I'M NOT. SHE'S BEEN SEEING HIM ALL THE TIME. OF COURSE SHE'S SEEN HIM. HE COMES HERE TO THE HOUSE, AND HE... HOW CAN A NICE, SENSIBLE GIRL LIKE YOU IMAGINE SUCH IDIOTIC THINGS? IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAD BEEN GOING ON, I WOULD HAVE SEEN IT. NO, YOU DON' SEE IT, FIONA. ALL I KNOW IS I LOVE GIG YOUNG, AND I'VE LOST HIM. HELLO. YES. YES, EVELYN. WHERE ARE YOU? I THOUGH YOU STARTED BACK LONG AGO. IT'S WHAT? RAINING? WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WALK BACK-OR ARE YOU? CLIMATE CAN STAND A LITTLE RAIN. YOU'LL BE BACK IN THE MORNING? NO, I DON'T SEE. IF GIG HAD ANY SENSE, HE'D CHASE YOU OUT OF THERE. AND YOU NEEDN'T TAKE THA INJURED TONE WITH ME, EVELYN. WHAT DO I THINK YOU'RE UP TO? WELL, I'D TELL YOU BUT I DON'T WANT MY PHONE TAKEN OUT. LOOK HERE, EVELYN, I WAN YOU TO COME BACK NOW- HELLO? HELLO? OPERATOR, I WAS CUT OFF. I-OH. I'M SORRY, BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO PUT ME UP FOR THE NIGH OR PUT UP WITH ME, WHICHEVER WAY YOU LIKE. WE'RE PRETTY PRIMITIVE HERE. I'M NOT AS CIVILIZED AS I LOOK. I'M TIRED. IT'S TIME YOU NIPPED INTO BED. YOU GOING TO BED, TOO? NOT YET. COME ON. IT'S TIME YOU HIT THE HAY. GEE, DO I HAVE TO, GIG? UNCLE GIG. HE WANTS ME TO CALL HIM GIG. AND I'M BUTCH. OK, BUTCH. OK, GIG. GOOD NIGHT, AUNT EVELYN. GOOD NIGHT, BUTCH. SUSANNA, ARE YOU STILL AWAKE? SUSANNA, I... SASKIA. SASKIA! SASKIA, I DON'T WANT ANYTHING SAID ABOUT THIS TO ANYONE, NOT EVEN TO EVELYN. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. YES, MISS FIONA. ANYONE COULD TAKE AN OVERDOSE OF THIS STUFF. I DON'T THINK YOU OUGHT TO HAVE IT AROUND THE HOUSE. I'M ALWAYS READING IN THE PAPERS HOW PEOPLE CAN'T SLEEP, AND THEN THEY GET UP, AND THEN THEY- EXACTLY. I'LL THROW THE REST OF IT AWAY. OH, AND SASKIA, STAY RIGHT HERE. DON'T LEAVE HER TILL I GET BACK HOME. YOU'D BETTER GO TO BED. WHY? YOU'RE CRUSHING ME. MAKING LOVE TO YOU. OH, GIG. HOLD ME CLOSE. OH, DON'T LET ME TALK. DON'T LET ME THINK. SOMEONE, LET ME IN! GIG! EVELYN! IT'S FIONA. I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL UP. TAXI, YOU CAN WAIT. I WON'T BE LONG. ANYTHING WRONG? NO. NO, I THINK EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. THEN WHAT BROUGH YOU DOWN HERE? A TAXI. IN SPITE OF THE RAIN, THEY'RE STILL OPERATING. RAIN? TORRENTS OF IT. DIDN'T EVELYN TELL YOU? WE PRACTICALLY HAD TO FORD THE RIVER. EVELYN, I WANT YOU TO GE YOUR HAT, COAT, AND AUSTIN. WE'RE GOING BACK TO TOWN. WHY CAN'T WE WAI TILL THE MORNING? BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST YOU TILL MORNING. YES. I'LL WAKE UP AUSTIN. SO YOU COULDN'T RESIST A CHANCE TO PLAY BIG SISTER. I'VE GOT ANOTHER SURPRISE FOR YOU. YOU'RE GOING BACK TO ENGLAND ON THE NEXT CLIPPER. YOU'LL PERSONALLY GUARANTEE THAT? PERSONALLY. I SHOULD THINK AFTER THE MESS YOU'VE MADE OF YOUR OWN LIFE, THAT YOU'D LEAVE MINE ALONE. IT'S NOT YOU I'M THINKING OF. IT'S SUSANNA. WELL, WHY SHOULDN'T YOU THINK ABOUT ME? I'M YOUR SISTER, TOO, YOU KNOW. AND I LIKE GIG. MAYBE I LIKE HIM A LOT. YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO. I'VE GOT AS MUCH RIGHT TO AS YOU HAD TO MARRY CHARLES BARCLAY. NOT WHILE YOU HAVE A HUSBAND. THAT'S HITTING BELOW THE BELT. IT'S AN OLD GAYLORD CUSTOM. WHAT DO I CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMS? THAT'S ALL YOU EVER THINK ABOUT-THAT AND YOURSELF. IT'S AN OBSESSION WITH YOU. YOU NEVER SEE ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU. IT'S YOUR HOUSE, YOUR SON, YOUR PRIDE. WHAT DO I CARE ABOUT THAT OR THE ESTATE OR YOUR FIGH WITH CHARLES BARCLAY? IF YOU WANT TO RUIN YOUR OWN LIFE, THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS, BUT I WARN YOU, FIONA- WELL, I GOT HIM UP. HE'S SCRAMBLING INTO HIS CLOTHES. HA! POOR KID, HE WAS HALF ASLEEP. I'LL HURRY HIM UP. STILL THE SAME OLD FIGHTING FIONA. SHE'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE WHEN SHE GETS GOING. SOMETIMES FORGETS THAT I'M A GAYLORD, TOO. LET ME SEE, NOW. THIS IS WHERE SHE CAME IN. I DON'T LIKE TO BE INTERRUPTED. I'M SLEEPY, MISS GAYLORD. WELL, YOU CAN GO BACK TO BED AS SOON AS WE GET HOME. ARE YOU READY TO GO? QUITE. PUT HIM TO BED, EVELYN. TAKE HIS THINGS. RIGHT, GENERAL. COME ON, BUTCH. MR. PEDLOCH? I HOPE I DIDN'T WAKE YOU. I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW, I'VE BROUGHT AUSTIN BACK. YES, I'M WILLING TO SETTLE WITH BARCLAY. GET THE PAPERS DRAWN UP RIGHT AWAY. YES, HE GETS THE HOUSE, TOO. NO. I WON'T WALK OU ON IT THIS TIME. SHE'S AWAKE. YOU CAN GO TO BED NOW. WELL, SUSANNA, NO MORE PALE CHEEKS OR RED EYES FOR YOU. THE GAYLORD CASE IS FINISHED. FINISHED? I DON'T SEE- I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT IN THE MORNING. FIRST THING FOR YOU TO DO IS GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP AND FORGET ALL THIS NONSENSE THAT HAPPENED TONIGHT. EVELYN AND AUSTIN ARE BACK, SO YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT ANY LONGER. EVELYN CAME BACK? YES. YOU'RE GIVING IN TO CHARLES BARCLAY. YES. FIONA. YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR ME. I'M DOING I FOR ALL OF US. BUT AUSTIN. WHAT ABOUT AUSTIN? SHH. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT FOR EVERYONE. NOW THAT WE HAVE THE OTHER SIGNATURES, MISS GAYLORD, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO AFFIX YOURS IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE GENTLEMEN. YES. THE LAW IS SO EXPLICIT. THANK YOU. AND NOW, WILL YOU WITNESS IT? NOW THIS SETTLES THE AGREEMEN TO DISPOSE OF THE GAYLORD HOUSE. WELL, WITH EVERYTHING AS CLEAR-CUT AS THIS, IT WON'T TAKE MORE THAN A DAY IN COURT. JUDGE BARROWS SHOULD BE AGREEABLY SURPRISED. INDEED HE WILL. SO, HE IS MY CHILD. AND HOW COULD YOU HATE ME AS YOU HAVE, ALL THESE YEARS? BECAUSE HE'S YOUR CHILD. NOW TO THE AGREEMEN ABOUT THE BOY. NO. THIS WON'T DO. WON'T DO? WHEN I AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT, I MEANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE PUBLICLY THAT BARCLAY WAS THE FATHER OF THE BOY. I MEANT THAT HE MIGHT VISI HIM AT REASONABLE INTERVALS. BUT I THOUGHT, OF COURSE, SINCE HE'S SO YOUNG, HE'D REMAIN WITH ME. I'M ENTITLED TO MORE THAN THAT. YOU'RE ENTITLED TO NOTHING I DON'T CHOOSE TO GIVE YOU. I HAPPEN TO HAVE MY OWN OPINION ON THAT. JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT? ONLY WHA THE LAW ALLOWS. EQUAL CUSTODY. THE BOY'S TIME WILL BE DIVIDED BETWEEN US. 6 MONTHS WITH YOU, 6 MONTHS WITH ME. HIS SCHOOLING- WHAT ABOUT THAT? WE'LL ARRANGE THA BETWEEN US. AND HIS VACATIONS? WITH WHOM DOES HE SPEND THOSE? BOTH OF US, ALTERNATELY. AND IF HE'S ILL... WHO DECIDES WHA TREATMENT HE SHOULD HAVE, WHAT DOCTOR TO CALL? WELL, THOSE ARE SMALL DETAILS THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT LATER. THERE ARE NO SMALL DETAILS IN A CHILD'S LIFE. EVERYTHING'S IMPORTANT. BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WHO HATE EACH OTHER, WHO ARE ONLY ACCIDENTALLY HIS MOTHER AND FATHER. DON'T YOU REALIZE HE'LL BE HARMED BY IT, AND THAT AS HE GROWS OLDER, HE'LL BE ASHAMED OF IT? I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH TOO MANY CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS WERE DIVORCED NOT TO KNOW WHAT IT DID TO THEIR LIVES. NO, THAT WON'T DO. IT WILL HAVE TO DO. YOU'RE MISTAKEN. I'M NOT GOING TO CU THAT CHILD IN TWO. YOU CAN'T KEEP HIM TO YOURSELF. NO, BUT YOU CAN. I MEAN TO GIVE HIM UP TO YOU. ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? QUITE. IF THAT CHILD IS GOING TO BEGIN TO HAVE PARENTS, LET HIM BEGIN PROPERLY. RIGHT NOW, HE DOESN' KNOW HE HAS ANYONE. THINK WHAT CONFUSION WOULD ENTER HIS MIND IF HE WERE SUDDENLY TOLD HE HAD A MOTHER AND FATHER WHO WOULD DIVIDE HIM BETWEEN THEM. HOW MUCH BETTER TO BE TOLD HE ONLY HAS A FATHER WHO WAS WILLING TO DEVOTE ALL HIS TIME TO HIS CARE AND UPBRINGING. THAT'S YOUR DECISION? MY ONLY DECISION. MR. WHEELER! MR. PEDLOCH! LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH. SASKIA! WHAT IS IT? SEND AUSTIN DOWN IMMEDIATELY WITH HIS HAT AND COAT. ALL RIGHT. I'LL SCRATCH OUT THE CLAUSE ABOUT DIVISION OF CUSTODY. HAVE YOUR CLIEN INITIAL IT. AFTER ALL, THE CHILD IS YOURS AND MINE. I WANT NOTHING THAT BELONGS TO YOU. I WISH IT DIDN' HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS. I WANT IT THIS WAY, AND I STILL WANT TO HATE YOU. YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SON, TAKE THE GAYLORD HOUSE AND TEAR IT DOWN STONE BY STONE, AND BUILD BARCLAY SQUARE. YOU'VE WON. AUSTIN, COME HERE. AUSTIN, THIS GENTLEMAN IS MR. CHARLES BARCLAY. HOW DO YOU DO, AUSTIN? HOW DO YOU DO, SIR? MR. BARCLAY IS GOING TO TAKE YOU HOME WITH HIM. WHY? MR. BARCLAY WILL TELL YOU ABOUT EVERYTHING LATER. AND NOW, AUSTIN, BE A GOOD BOY. YES, MA'AM. AND DO AS YOU'RE TOLD. YES, MA'AM. WELL, AREN'T YOU GOING? COME ALONG, YOUNG MAN. MISS GAYLORD? WHAT IS IT? WHEN AM I COMING BACK? IT'S NOT VERY POLITE TO TALK ABOUT THA WHEN YOUR VISIT HASN' EVEN BEGUN, IS IT? NO, MA'AM. AUSTIN... FIX YOUR COLLAR. WELL, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'LL NEED ME ANYMORE, BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO- THANK YOU. YOU'VE BEEN VERY KIND AND PATIENT. ONE THING MORE ABOUT THIS PROPERTY... HE'S VERY ANXIOUS TO COMPLETE THE BARCLAY SQUARE PROJECT. BARCLAY SQUARE. I PROMISED I'D NEVER SELL. LAND WAS OUR RELIGION. HA! WE BELIEVED IN IT ALMOS MORE THAN WE BELIEVED IN GOD. AUSTIN DIDN'T WAN TO GO, DID HE? NO, HE DIDN'T. WHY DID YOU SEND HIM AWAY? UH, BARCLAY SAYS THAT YOU'RE NOT TO BE INCONVENIENCED. HE SAYS ANY TIME YOU'RE READY- I'M READY TO GO NOW. IT'S NOT MY HOUSE ANY LONGER, IT'S CHARLES BARCLAY'S, AND THE SOONER I GE OUT OF IT, THE BETTER. I'LL START PACKING AT ONCE. I NEVER DID LIKE LAW ANYHOW. ALL READY FOR THE JUNKMAN. THERE WE ARE, THE 3 GRACES. MM-HMM. RIGH UNDER HERE. SASKIA! SASKIA, COME AND HELP ME PACK MY SUITCASES! IT'S ALL RIGHT, SASKIA, I DON'T NEED YOU NOW. ALL RIGHT. I'LL ANSWER THE DOOR. ANYTHING TO SPEED THE DEPARTING GUEST, EH, SUSANNA? YOU KNOW I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. AFTER ALL, EVELYN IS MY SISTER. SHE MIGHT HAVE THOUGH OF THAT FIRST. PAPA'S WINE BOOK. I'LL GO DOWN AND SEE WHAT'S LEFT. MR. GIG YOUNG... JUST IN TIME TO HELP THE GAYLORD GIRLS WITH THEIR PACKING. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS PAPER? WHAT IS IT? IT SAYS LORD BURTON'S DEAD. NO. YEAH, HIS PLANE CRASHED. I THOUGHT THE EMBASSY HAD NOTIFIED HER - NOTIFIED EVELYN. SHE DIDN'T HEAR FROM THEM. YOU'D BETTER TELL HER. I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. I KNOW WHA YOU'RE THINKING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET ME DOWN EASY. YOU'D BETTER GO TO EVELYN. SHE'S UPSTAIRS PACKING. WHY DID YOU DO THAT, SUSANNA? IT'S WHERE HE WANTED TO GO. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HIM THAT SAYER ALLEN HAD AGREED TO AN ANNULMENT- THAT YOU'D BOUGHT HIM OFF, THAT YOU WERE FREE? SO IS EVELYN FREE. SHE'LL NEVER GO BACK NOW. LIFE'S LITTLE JOKES. FOR 20 YEARS, WE'VE BEEN SAYING, "ONCE THE ESTATE IS SETTLED, WE'LL ALL BE HAPPY." WELL, THE ESTATE IS SETTLED. ARE YOU HAPPY, FIONA? DELIRIOUSLY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED YOU THAT. I KNOW WHAT YOU MUS BE FEELING ABOUT AUSTIN. YOU'RE SWEET, SUSANNA. YOU'RE THE SOFT ONE OF THE FAMILY. WHY SHOULD I MISS AUSTIN? HE'S NEVER BEEN PART OF MY LIFE. I SCARCELY KNOW HIM, AND HE SCARCELY KNOWS ME. HE'S MUCH BETTER OFF WHERE HE IS THAN WITH ME. OH, FIONA. I MEAN IT. SUSANNA, LET'S GO DOWN AND DRINK TO THE END OF THE GAYLORDS. BUT I CAN' GO BACK NOW. SURE YOU CAN. TO WHAT? WHAT IS THERE FOR ME? WHY SHOULD I? YOU HAD A LOT OF FUN BEING LADY BURTON. IT'S TIME YOU PAID SOMETHING FOR IT. POOR HAL! HE WAS DOING HIS JOB - THE ONLY EXCUSE A MAN HAS FOR LIVING OR DYING. OH, STOP THAT. I CAN'T. HE WAS MY HUSBAND. IT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE REMINDED ME OF IT. YOU HATE ME. I DON'T HATE YOU. LISTEN, EVELYN... WE'RE ALL LITTLE PEOPLE, TRYING TO FIND AND GRAB WHAT HAPPINESS WE CAN. WE FIGHT BACK AND LOVE EACH OTHER AND WORK AWHILE AND DIE, STILL LITTLE PEOPLE. BUT ONCE IN A WHILE, ONE OF US GETS A CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING. LIFE HANDS IT TO US ON A PLATTER. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE. DON'T MISS IT. GO BACK? BUT I'LL BE ALONE. WE'RE ALL OF US ALONE. YOU'LL HAVE SUSANNA. YOU LOVED HER ALL THE TIME, DIDN'T YOU? LOOK, YOU WERE UNHAPPY, I WAS UNHAPPY, SUSANNA WAS UNHAPPY. SO WE ALL TRIED TO LOSE OURSELVES BY MAKING EACH OTHER A LITTLE MORE UNHAPPY. IS THAT ALL IT WAS? THAT'S ALL IT EVER WAS. NOW BE A GOOD GIRL AND GET SOME SLEEP. ARE YOU GOING? YES. WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK? AFTER YOU'VE LEFT. WOULD YOU KISS ME BEFORE YOU GO? OF COURSE I WILL. SO IT IS GOOD-BYE. OH! THAT'S THE LAS OF THE BURGUNDY. NOW WE HAVE TO DRINK CHAMPAGNE. LET THEM EAT CAKE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING PERCHED OVER THERE? THINKING. COME OVER HERE. EVERYTHING'S SETTLED. THAT'S A GRAND AND GLORIOUS FEELING, ISN'T IT? NO FEELING LIKE IT. THAT'S WHAT I SAY. THAT HOLLOW, EMPTY FEELING, AS IF SOMEONE HAD JUST BORED A TUNNEL TO BROOKLYN THROUGH YOU. ABSOLUTELY. WHAT I NEED IS REOXYGENATION OF THE BLOOD. WHAT YOU NEED IS ANOTHER DRINK. POOR PAPA'S CELLAR. NOTHING LEFT OF IT. POOR PAPA'S CHILDREN. NOTHING LEFT OF THEM. WHERE'S EVELYN? WHERE ARE THE LITTLE STARS AT DAWN, FIONA? I DON'T KNOW. WHERE'S MY GIRLHOOD AND THE TOP OF MY HEAD AND THE FIRST INNOCENCE OF MY MIND? EVELYN IS WEEPING ON THE SHOULDER OF MR. GIG YOUNG, THE FAMOUS MODERN ARTIST. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF HIM? I'LL STILL TAKE ART BY REMBRANDT AND LEONARDO DA VINCI. MONA LISA. ME, TOO. BUT FOR LOVE, IT'S GIG ACROSS THE BOARD. FIONA, WHAT IS LOVE? LOVE? LOVE IS SOMETHING YOU CUT OUT OF YOURSELF, OR IT MOVES IN AND CUTS YOU APART. CAN YOU WALK, SUSANNA? WALK? MMM, THAT STUFF PEOPLE DO ON TWO LEGS. I'VE HEARD OF IT. OH, YOU MEAN WALK. LIKE THIS. THAT'S IT. THANK YOU. - GOOD NIGHT. - GOOD NIGHT, FIONA. GOOD NIGHT, LADIES, GOOD NIGHT, LADIES GOOD NIGHT, LADIES, WE'RE GOING TO... I DON'T FRIGHTEN YOU, DO I, AUSTIN? YOU LIKED IT HERE. YOU SAID YOU DID. YOU SAID YOU LIKED IT FINE. "FEEL MY MUSCLE, UNCLE GIG. IT'S AS BIG AS AN ERSTER." I TAUGHT YOU TO FIGHT BACK, DIDN'T I, AUSTIN? I WILL LAY ME DOWN AND BLEED A WHILE, AND RISE AND FIGHT AGAIN. THAT'S THE THING TO DO. HA HA HA! IF ONLY I... I'M SO TIRED. BUT I'VE GOT NO HEART, AND YOU CAN'T GET TIRED WITHOUT A HEART. YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT A HEART. FIONA. SHHH... RIGHT HERE IN THIS VERY HOUSE, BUFFALO BILL KISSED ME. IT WAS A WINTER'S DAY, AND I RAN DOWN THE STAIRS, AND WALKED INTO THE ROOM, AND THERE WAS PAPA, AND OVER THERE WAS BUFFALO BILL, AND... WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? THE DOOR WAS OPEN. GET OU OF MY HOUSE. OH, NO. IT'S MY HOUSE NOW. YOU'RE GETTING OUT. I'LL GO IN THE MORNING. YOU'RE GOING TONIGHT-NOW. OH, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE GOING TO PUT ME OUT. YES. OOAAH! AH OOH OOH OOH HOO! OOHMMPH! AND DON'T SCREAM. I'M STILL YOUR HUSBAND. IT'S COLD, AND I HATE COLD WATER! HA HA! YOU HATE ANYTHING THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU. BRRR! WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH. YOU CAN SHUT IT OFF NOW. I SAY, "YOU CAN TURN IT OFF." UGHH! I'VE ORDERED SOME BREAKFAST. I WON'T EAT IT! OH, IT'S GOING TO BE VERY GOOD- BAKED APPLES; EXCELLEN COFFEE; NICE, THIN PANCAKES WITH LITTLE PINK SAUSAGES; AND VERMONT MAPLE SYRUP. HA! YOU REMEMBER VERMONT. A TRUCK DRIVER'S BREAKFAST! I WON'T EAT IT! I TOLD YOU I WON'T EAT. WELL, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT? $25,000- PRETTY GOOD TIP. PRETTY GOOD. AND YOU TOOK I AND TOOK ME. YES. I MARRIED YOU. NO, I MARRIED YOU, AND I PAID YOU FOR IT IN MONEY. I COULDN' SLEEP VERY WELL. OH, HELLO, AUSTIN. MISS GAYLORD. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? CHASING A DEER. I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY NICE TO CALL YOUR MOTHER "MISS". MY MOTHER? TH-THEN WE ARE RELATIONS. I WAS THINKING IF BUFFALO BILL COULD KISS GIRLS, I COULD, TOO. WHY THAT'S... THAT'S VERY HANDSOME OF YOU, AUSTIN. HAVE YOU HAD YOUR BREAKFAST, YET? NO, SIR. WELL, DON'T YOU THINK YOU BETTER HAVE IT NOW? FIONA... I LOVE YOU. I HATE YOU. WOULDN'T HAVE ME IF I WAS THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, WOULD YOU? NO. GOOD. WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE FROM THERE. I WAS AFRAID YOU MIGHT HAVE BECOME INDIFFERENT TO ME. FIONA... I'VE LOVED YOU SINCE THE FIRST MOMENT I SET EYES ON YOU. I'VE NEVER STOPPED LOVING YOU. THAT'S WHY I TOOK AUSTIN. I THOUGHT PERHAPS THAT WHERE HE WENT, YOU MIGHT FOLLOW. OH, WHY I SHOULD WAN TO MESS UP MY LIFE WITH A BAD-TEMPERED VIXEN LIKE YOU, HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS. FIONA, WHY DON' YOU STOP FIGHTING ME? FUNNY... THIS... THIS ROOM STINKS OF APPLE BLOSSOMS.
