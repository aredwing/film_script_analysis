I'm alive. - Zoe. You need to put someone else on. Put someone else on so they can tell me where you are. Zoe, I've got to hang up. I'm going to call the operator and locate the address for this number. I love you, Dane. I love you. Fuck yeah, bitch! Ain't it past your bed time? I'm a night creature, man! I won't rest until I'm dead, Jed. Aheheheh. Dead, Jed. I heard they found two fucked up Injuns in Bluffs Creek. Would you believe I've been cleaning up that mess all god damn night. I still got blood on my boots. If you ask me, them two Injuns got what they deserved. Fucking breed like rabbits. You heard about that, that deaf-mute girl went missing? Yeah. I heard about that. Pretty girl. She's just your type too. Yeah, they found her car just down the road. A shame. Now, I'm guessing... A sexy little girl like that wonders in here, lost and alone. A man like you is not going to hesitate to taking her home... hog tie her up and sodomizing that sweet virgin ass. Now would you? Jed? Oh, take it easy, fucker. I'm just fucking with you. Jed? What? Can you not see I'm talking to this gentleman? 44 Main Street. Okay. Okay, thank you. Don't! No, no, no! Noooo! Fuck! You opened me up like a can of sardines. Why you fucking cunt! Do you have any idea what they do to cop killers? They fucking fry them! No, no, no, no! Okay, I'll make you a deal. I'm going to tell everyone it's the local savages who did it, okay? And they're going to believe me, do you know why? Because I'm the fucking law. Oh, my God. - Yo! Mister, you can't go in there! - My girlfriend's in there! Zoe! There's no girl in there. Now slow down and tell me your story. My fiancee, Zoe, has been missing for 3 days now. I called you guys and filed a report! What are you doing here? She called me about an hour ago from a payphone on the street. - An hour ago? - Yes! - From here? - Yes! I... traced the call. I thought you said she was deaf. She's deaf but she can articulate some words, like my name. She probably wasn't even sure I was on the line. But she's in trouble, real trouble, I can tell. Is your girlfriend capable of killing a deputy sheriff and a 6 foot, 240 pound bartender? No, that's ridiculous. Zoe is light as a feather. Besides, she wouldn't harm a fly. In that case, she's going to have to take a back seat to the situation here. Look, stop by the station first thing in the morning. I'll see what I can do. No, no, no, no, Trey. No! Well? - It's him. - Jesus Christ! Somebody butched him up real good. Get the fuck out of here! Excuse me. I was wondering if you gentlemen can help me? Sorry. We don't help niggers. Well then. How about helping a nice white girl? My fiancee passed through town a couple of days ago. I ain't got time for this shit. Get the fuck out of here. She called me from that payphone less than an hour ago. What'd you say? She's probably still in the area. She called you? Yeah. Any reason why she shouldn't have? Look, man. If you know what's good for you, I'd walk away. My friend, their brother was just killed. So, this really ain't a good time. Then, you know what it is to lose someone. I've lost someone. And all I'm asking you to do, is take a look at her picture. Sorry, never seen her. Pretty girl though. I hope you find her. And if you'll just excuse us. Come on. All you got to do is look. Aren't you curious to see what a nigger lover looks like? Or maybe you already know? That's enough! Put that away! Trey, call off your dog. Now look, I'm awful sorry about what happened to your brother. Jed McGreedy was a good man and a fine deputy. But right now I need you to go home. All of you! You're gonna want to be spending time with your families right now. Not locked up behind bars for disorderly conduct! Now, go on! You. In my office. The nigger's bluffing. No way she'd called him. How do you know? Because when I kill someone, they stays dead. Show me. I want to see the body. Those fucking guys know something about Zoe. I'm certain of it. One of the murder victims is Trey's brother. And he ain't gonna take it kindly if you keep hounding him. And right now, I got some dead bodies I got to deal with. And lucky for you, your girlfriend isn't one of them. She's a pretty girl. She drive a 68 Blue GTO? Yeah. Somebody reported it on the side of the highway this morning. How'd you figure she went missing here in Acme? Zoe loves to take photos with her phone. She knew I was concerned, so she was sending a photo upon the hour. The last photo she sent was this one. Yes, that's route 40 alright. You mind? Everything alright between you two? Yeah. We're getting ready to take a big leap. Move in together. Get married. I want to buy her the biggest diamond, but... She insisted on a simple band, had it engraved. "Zoe and Dane forever." Look. I'll have my deputy dust that payphone for prints. You can follow me down to the station and... I'll have you fill out an official report. Well, it ain't very deep, West. Why don't you just bury her in front of the police station. I stuck my blade in her to the hilt. Ain't no fucking way she got up and walked away. What if she's alive? She went back into town and fucking killed Jed. He was disemboweled and scalped. That ain't the work of a gut eater, I don't know what is! Still, where's the body? Coyotes. Wild dogs. The desert. Is... Is that a grave? Skeeter, get on back to the car! No, let him look! He needs to learn this is a crazy fuck up world! Yeah, and sometimes... even God's good creatures... They need to be sacrificed. Ain't that right, West? Alright. Given the events of the past week, I'll say there's any number of people who wanted to see Jed dead. As far as our little Angeline now. The nigger said she called him. If that's true, where the fuck she'd go? Let's say if she wasn't a corpse when West buried her, I bet she sure is hell is by now. Creed, we should lay low. Get out of Dos till this shit blows over. Sure,Trey. Sounds good. So, why scalped him? It don't make no sense. Unless it was a squaw. Dog's been humping a few Reservation girls on a regular bases. It was a man, based on how Jed was butched, he's skilled, lethal. Probably a hunter. Alright, that's everyone. What the fuck! God damn it, Trey, pick up the fucking phone. Yeah, this better be fucking important. You guys, got to get over to my place, man. I think she's here. I think she's fucking... ... here! God damn it! No, no! Please! No, no! Please, fucking please, no! No... No, wait! No! Fuck you! Get the backpack. Yeah, I hate to do this... Until this all blows over. Arrivederci, old friend. You guys, got to get over to my place, man. You were pretty far gone when I found you. I patched you up the best I could then I attempted to bring you back. Only you weren't alone. You were in the company of Red Sleeves, the great Apache chieftain. Betrayed and murdered by white men of a 100 years ago. He insisted he return with you. I said no. The old ways will not be tolerated in today's world. Precious time was lost. By the time I reunited your body with spirit, your heart gave out and you died. In any other case, you would remain dead. But the Chief... ... is cunning and quick. He entered your body at the same time and you became one. But, know this. The flesh will not sustain for long. So, whatever you must do, do it before it's too late. He's dead alright. Turned him into a human pincushion. I got to see it. I got to see him! Get the fuck out of my way, Trey! Fuck that. Don't fucking move! Any sign of the law? You let her live, didn't you? Huh? Now, she's out for blood! Ain't no way some deaf mute city girl's gonna get to jump on Creed much less Jed. Creed said it was her. You heard him say it. So explain that! I can't. I know what I know. If you ask me, I'd say there's something wicked at work. Unnatural. I feel it. - I feel it in my bones. - Ha! Unnatural or not. She found herself a hunting bow and now we all got targets on our asses! Fuck! Alright. We got to turn the tables! Alright? We're going to get ourselves some nigger bait, and we're gonna lure her to us like a bitch in heat. We're gonna bring her to us. In that case, you're gonna need some guns. Yeah, guns, some guns. A lot of fucking guns! You know, the bartender, Coby, who got killed with Jed, his father's a second lieutenant in the Marines. He's a crazy motherfucker. - He's gonna want some pay back - That man was in the Korean War. He's older than dirt. Yeah, but it makes no matter. That guy's got a cashier of weapons big enough to defend Fort Knox. Aye? Let's move. Skeeter, you're gonna have to sit this one out. Belle! Stop digging in that earth. Get in here this instance. What you got there? Some dead animal? Oh my God! Are you sure you dog didn't go strolling off the premises? We got 4 hectares, it's all fenced in. Where's he gonna go? And you haven't seen any strangers wondering around at night? No, but some son of a bitch has been stealing from my barn. My new hunting bow I got from Christmas, arrows and everything. Hunting bow, huh? Mind I take a look? Good god, oh mighty! What'd you got in here, a dead coyote? My oh my! Something dead has been living in here. Lizzy, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. It can't be alive if it's dead. Dispatch to Sheriff Holt, come in. Go ahead, Jesse. Officer Stanfield just called in. He says he found Creed Traver's dead. He says it looks like somebody used him for target practice. What do you mean? He was all shot up with arrows. Jesus Christ! Tell Stanfield to wait there. I'm on my way. One more thing. The result from the lab came in, and you were right. Jed's killer used the payphone. His killer? The prints from the bottle used to killed Jed, matched the one on the payphone. MISSING PERSON REWARD! PLEASE HELP! NAME: ZOE CARDEN Please forget me Zoe! Oh. Are you okay? This is for Creed! Angel, we got your boyyy! Angel, we got your boyyy! We're gonna open a can of them worms on this nigger! That should get her fucking attention, huh, Trey? Fuck! - Shit... - Oh mother of God! Let's go! Catch me! Damn fucking bitch. What the fuck is in my neck? God damn it! The hospital's that way. Fucking other way. She's in the fucking truck, man. Why don't you die, fucking bitch! Oh. Suck on this! Whoa! Yeah! - Fucking aye, Trey. - Oh, how'd you like that? What the fuck! That did not fucking happen. What the fuck? I must have stabbed that bitch over 2 dozen times. I could not shake her resolve. - And that look in her eyes. - Trey. I've seen it before. Soulless. - West. - Like a Grim Reaper. Savage. You guys. You got to get me to the hospital. I can't stay here. I'm gonna die if I stay here. It's as if her dead carcass is being controlled like a puppet. Then maybe we need to be asking ourselves. Who's pulling the strings? Well, you know. The only man I know in town that can do something like that is the old witch doctor. - Witch doctor. - I need a doctor! Shut the fuck up, Cody! When we get out of here, I say we pay that old Indian a visit. The cavalry's here. Move out. Welcome to the war, man. I see you came dressed for the occasion. Goat. Roddy, I'm sorry about to your boy. Clay served the best tequila on this side of the Mexican border, we all loved him. The bitch sliced his throat from ear to ear, butched him like cattle. I want to know who and why the fuck she did this to my boy. Why? Wrong place, wrong time. Uh, who? Well... That's a tale for campfires that will make you toe nails grow up. Show me the party favors! Men, let me introduce to you, the M4 carbine assault rifle. Endorsed by the same Grim Reaper himself. This little baby has sent more terrorist to hell than any other weapon on the planet. That's what I'm talking about. You yahoos want to tell me why that bitch went on a murderous rampage. Why my boy is on a slab in the morgue? It must have been a damnable sin. Let's just say she was a... real life angel. Deaf-mute. But, her eyes... ... they spoke volumes. Heavenly eyes. Virgin to the evils men do. Till that fateful day. Jed went first, pumping into her like a wild stallion. I swear that he was going to have a heart attack. The fighting and the kicking and the barbed wire, didn't stop her. None. Oh, after Jed come Creed and Cody went up. Cody... They must have broke her because just when I had at her. She just lay there quiet like while I did my thing. Hell, I think she even enjoyed it. But all good things must come to an end. And that's when West pulled out that bowie knife of his. Gut into that nigger lover to the hilt. Says he buried her too. Ain't that right, West? I reckoned she didn't like her resting place, 'cos the next thing we know... She's back from the dead. And hell-bent on killing us all. Guess that's what happens when you drag an angel into hell. It becomes a demon. That's it, I'm getting the fuck out of here. Sit your ass down, Cody You walk out that door, that air is the least of your concerns. I'm bleeding out like a slaughtered pig here, Trey. I can't let you go, brother. That arrow hit an artery you'd be dead by now. From what I can tell, the bleeding's slowed. So, come sun up, we'll fetch Dr. Myers. Dr. Myers. The veterinarian? Come on. Fuck! - Skeeter? - Sheriff. Come on out here, boy. Your brothers around? You want to tell me about the girl? Was Jed involved? Was Jed involved? He hurt her bad. They all did. Is she alive? Dammit, boy, answer me! Is she alive or is she dead? She ain't dead! West killed her but she didn't stay dead. She murdered Jed and Creed, and now, she's coming for us all. Where are they? You know what I think? I think you boys gave that girl a greater appreciation for the white meat. Maybe she don't give a fuck for this nigger anymore. What are you looking at? You want a piece of me? Huh? Motherfucker! What the fuck you're doing? Nigger and his bitch are going to pay for what they did to my boy. The man had nothing to do with it. Bullshit! Blackies rolling into Acme for one or two reasons: To start trouble. Or to spread the good Lord's gospel. Well, I don't see a crucifix on his neck. I say we shoot him in the knees. Then, when she hears him scream. Maybe, she'll understand the urgency of the situation. You might end up on her shit list. Fuck her! Bring it on! Cody's getting away. Cody! He's taking my car! Crap! He makes it to the hospital, that's all shit roll. Sorry, brother. Oh. Hell, no! I'm not dying today. I'm not dying today! Well, that ain't the puppet master himself. Goat, you stay here. Make sure she doesn't come up this way. Will, Roddy, take cover in that house behind us. You force that bitch straight to us. Come on! What the fuck is going on? What kind of sick mind game are you all playing? No game. Valentine day's come early this year. Your sweetheart's come home. She's alive? Yeah, for lack of a better word. Don't fuck with me! Is she alive or is she dead? Zoe... is alive. She's alive! And she's gonna... She's gonna get you! - What the fuck are you doing? - I'm not doing anything. She's gonna kill all you motherfuckers! Ha ha ha ha... You motherfuckers! Is this some kind of a joke? West, go check that out. BABY, GIVE THEM HELL !!! YEAHHH ! You thought Zoe was deaf and dumb, huh? Shut your fucking mouth! My baby has an axe to grind! - She'll chew your ass up! - Motherfucker! I think I got her. Fucking dumb asses. Get off me, fucker...! Fuck. God damn it. What the fuck! What the fuck. Who are you? What do you want? One little, two little... Three little Indians... Four little, five little, Six little Indians. Seven little, eight little, Nine little Indians, Ten little Indian boys. West? West? WALK IN HELL! Trey McGreedy! This is Sheriff Holt! I need you boys to come out of there! Make sure I can see your hands! Sheriff! Sheriff, get me out of here! Parsons, are you in there? Sheriff! You ain't real. You ain't real. Sheriff! Oh my God! Am I glad to see you! - Trey. - Yeah. - Stay right there. - You have... You have no idea. God damn it, Trey, don't make me shoot you! This is so... Sheriff? Sheriff... She's alive. My baby's alive. Zoe? Oh my God. Look what they've done to you. No! Wait. No. Zoe. Zoe, baby, we need to get you to a hospital. Zoe? Zoe! Help me. Mr. Parsons. I must tell you something about you fiancee. The truth will be hard for you to hear. And harder to comprehend. You must call me when you get this. Don't you fucking move. "Walk in hell". Huh? Mean anything to you? Words my great grandaddy whispered to an Apache Chief before beheading him over a 100 fucking years ago. Nobody knows that except for me and my kin. So, what the hell is going on? I was only trying to save a life which you took. - But I was too late. - The hell you were too late! She's running around killing like a blood thirsty savage. It was their mutual hunger for the blood of your ancestors that brought them together. - They found each other. - You say his name, god damn it. I'm warning you. You say his name. Red Sleeves. The great Apache Chief "Mangas Coloradas". He's been watching from the shadows while your family perpetuates the extermination of his people. You do something! Or I swear I'll kill you right here. For the young woman sake, I would stop this if I could. But there's nothing I can do. Her bloodshed will not cease until you... - The last is dead. - Bullshit! You brought him here, you can send him the fuck away! There is only one way. Lay the great Chief to rest. Here, on sacred ground. But, when you consider, he's been lost in this vast desert plains for over a 100 years. Lady Luck better be smiling upon you. You old fool. You have no idea. Get in the god damn trailer! I'm telling you, it was my fiancee. You guys need to be out there searching. When the officers on the scene found you, they said that you were facing the wall. How could you have seen her? The reflection in the glass. She was hurt. God knows what they did to her. She didn't even looked like herself. I warned Trey, that boy was not like the rest of us. He didn't have no criminal mind. And now look at him! The light of my life is gone. It wouldn't matter if is. You'd have come to kill him anyway. Wouldn't you, Mangas My grandpa, Joseph, did the best he could to exterminate you all. And when he died, the deed fell to my daddy. And then on to me. Me and my boys. Big shoes to fill. And as far as the young lady's concerned. Sorry, honey. You're just a casualty of war. Fuck! Okay. What the hell? Shit! Damn it! Mangas? Come on, man! Mangas! Fucking Mangas! Well, well... I thought I smelled some of that eau de toilette your wear. See what I've done. It's a little something, for the two of you to get cosy. Don't it just make you wanna lay that pretty head of yours down? Per Se. An eternity? Like that? Oh, yeah. Come on! Oh! You fucking bitch! You fucking... Fuck! You walk in hell. What happened here? What happened? (sign) I love you. I love you too. Did I do the right thing? It was all you could do. Now, she's gone from this cruel world. But exist in a better place. A beautiful world that awaits us all. Do you really believe that? I have seen the gates. Though, I've not been permitted to enter. At least not yet.
