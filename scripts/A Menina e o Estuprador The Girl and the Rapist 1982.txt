I thought this time you would be home at least for a week. Get out. I want to talk to my mom. I can't stand living here with these two. - Mom! - Vanessa! Why did I have a daughter? I should have had an abortion. Let's go. - Have they left? -Yes, ma'am. Will you be away for long this time? I never know how long I'll be away. Four, five weeks. Vanessa is getting harder to deal with. I don't try to talk to her anymore. She only screams back at me. Treats Pedro like a slave. You were always more of a mother to her than me. I can't help her, and I don't have time either. If you two can't stay, I'll just get new servants. Please call me a taxi. I'm late. They said they'd be waiting at the rocks. You know I'm not like that, Denise. I don't like it. Don't give me that again. You'll meet my new guy. He's awesome in bed. That's the one. She loves the skin flute. She said her friend is good at it. - Good at what? -I don't know. Find out. It must be very good. Arlindo, go for it! I'm sorry. I thought you... You thought what? I don't know. Your friend there... She does everything! Wait, I didn't mean to compare you and her. I'm crazy for you. I mean it. Come on, I'm sorry! -Stop following me! - Sorry. Shit! Arlindo, go take care of that girl. So much energy. I want a coconut. Vanessa! You and that obsession. - What's your waist measure? - 60 cm And the breasts? - And the hips? - 88 Thighs? Stop it, Pedro. Vanessa pisses me enough already. Ma'am didn't want to talk about it. She said if we're not happy, we should leave. I don't care. I can't stand seeing Vanessa treating you... ...like a bellboy. She just orders you around. "Let's go now! Fix my roller skates!" "Go to the drugstore for me!" I don't know how you can stand her. What's your shoe size? Hello Dalva, it's Denise. Is Vanessa there? Vanessa is asleep. She had another episode. I will take her to a friend. That would be good. That's a real crazy one. Leave it to me. Don't wait for me. I'll take a taxi. Arlindo is crazy about you. And he wants to see your violin. Hi. This is my friend Vanessa. Everything alright, Denise? I have a new guy. He's really something. Denise told me some difficult things. That you sometimes scream. Get all dirty. Always carrying a violin. Interesting case. Just as I like it. Give her my number. I'm sure she will call. Now let's talk about you. What time is it? It's still early. She'll be back soon. Dal! Leave her alone. Dr. Artur's office. I want to talk to him. He is visiting a new client. Would you care to leave a message? No. I'll call later. A young man is asking to see you. Send him in. Hi. I was nearby and... These are for you. I picked them at your garden. It's the thought that counts, right? Let's go grab a snack? Next time it will work out. Here. Wait. Yes? - Dr. Artur? - Are you Vanessa? He is expecting you. Dr. Artur, Vanessa is here. Yes, doctor. See you tomorrow. Take a seat. You knew I was coming? Denise told me about your hallucinations. - I don't like to talk about it. - Why did you come then? How long have you had these hallucinations? A long time. A very long time. Can you tell me one of them? It will help you a lot, Vanessa. - Always big, strong men touching me... - No, no. Slowly. From the beginning. Does it always happen? I never know when. Sometimes I stare at someone. Then that person looks at me. And suddenly... He starts touching me. Then everything changes. Go on. No! So when he touches you, everything changes? What's wrong with you? It used to be everyday. Then three times a week. Then twice. And now none. I'm not in the mood lately. Is it Vanessa? I'm going for a walk. Hi Vanessa. You're a little late. Hey, talk to me! You knew I was coming? I know all about your life. Denise has a big mouth. And what a mouth! Wait, Vanessa! Give me a chance. Wait a little longer. Do you have to go upstairs? Be careful, Vanessa. He's a bit crazy. Yesterday I hated him. But I don't know. Something made me come back. My childhood was like everyone else's. Regular. Lonely. Lonely? - Mom was never home. - Why? - I don't know. - And your father? I barely knew him. He was one of my mother's lovers. She got pregnant and they married. Civil marriage. I think I was always a burden for mom. They never lived together. She just had me because it was too late for an abortion. - Who takes care of you? - A couple of servants. You don't like them. Why? - They treat me like it was just a job. - And they're mean to you? Yes, I don't know. I never thought... Sit down, Vanessa. Is there any event from your childhood registered in your memory? Something bad done to you? Remember when you were a child? We always remember... ...a little of something. No! I don't remember! Try a little harder, Vanessa. It squeezed me. That dark hand. Did he caress you? - I don't know. - Did he do something to you? No! No! I can't! I can't! Go on, Vanessa. Go on! I don't remember! You have to remember! - Hello. - I need you now! - Sure. Why? - Can you pick me up? Where? Be there in 10 minutes. Fuck, couldn't she call a minute later? May I help you? Vanessa? She left a few minutes ago. She had her reasons for not going back to the car. Don't look for her. Let her come back on her own. - Something wrong, Vanessa? - Let's go. Didn't she say when she'd be back? When does Vanessa ever tell me anything? Told me to leave. Didn't know how long it would take. I always come here. The only place I feel safe. No visions. No spying servants. I think you shouldn't see him again. Look at Denise. Crazier everyday, but she's been in therapy... ...with him for more than a year. I wanted to die when I left there. But if I can overcome that, something brings me back. I trust him. The fact I called you now... ...means I'm getting better. I feel that I can be touched. That you can touch me. I'm even getting in the mood for... Arlindo? Pedro! Vanessa isn't home yet. A man is waiting for you. He seems worried. My relationship with other clients is not your business. You are running away from me. From the truth, Vanessa. My presence disturbs you because I arouse in your memory... ...that which you don't want to remember. But you know very well what happened. We are close to the bottom of your paranoia, Vanessa. Yes, paranoia. Be honest with yourself. Don't run away from the truth, like you did last time. Go to the bottom, Vanessa. To the bottom! You didn't want to remember what happened at the school that day. But you know what happened. You know it! That image was recorded in your subconscious. That was just the beginning. Now we'll go to the very end! Vanessa said they were leaving for the place where she finds peace. It begins now, Vanessa. Let's see how far can insanity go. I used you both all this time. Just guinea pigs for my experiments. For a year I led Denise to this crazy state. Very slowly. Enjoying myself. You were unlucky, Vanessa. You showed up unexpected. But as soon as I saw you... ...I noticed you were as crazy a person as I was looking for. Show me the courage of an insane person. Don't stop, Vanessa. No, Vanessa! No! It wasn't Pedro. Pedro, it wasn't you. It was them who... I was late that day, Vanessa. For my own selfish pleasure... ...I ruined my life and yours. Pedro, you're late to pick Vanessa at school! Vanessa can wait a little. I've never told this to anybody. You were traumatized! But you've never talked about it. Vanessa, finish it! Use the knife. Nothing will ruin my plans. I wonder if Denise will be fine. Sure she will, with a real treatment.
