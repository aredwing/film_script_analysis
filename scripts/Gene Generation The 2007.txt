I mean, naturally, I guarantee nothing, but... the procedure may be the last hope. Led by Dr. Josephine Hayden, my team created a device capable of instantly reconfiguring human DNA. Try that now. By manipulating genetic code we learned to heal wounds, cure disease all in a matter of seconds. Our miracle device was known as The Transcoder. There is no precedent for this technology. But even miracles have their cost. Dr. Josephine Hayden found herself a victim of her own tragedy, her DNA mutated, leaving her a monster beyond recognition. I realized that The Transcoder's calibration to the user's unique DNA meant unpredictable consequences when operated by anyone but its creator. I also realized its potential use as a weapon. As one of the only surviving scientists of the Hayden Technologies disaster, I felt it my duty to stay in Olympia, perhaps restore the reputation and honorable uses of genetic manipulation. But time is running out. The accident not only destroyed Hayden Industries, but also the atmosphere of Olympia, forcing the citizens to flee to the unfinished walls surrounding our city. To gain admission to the walls, you had to pass a genetics test... Welcome to the Liquid Room. ...a selection process that soon led desperate people to commit desperate acts. Hey, what the hell are you doing, man? - I apologize. - Hey, what's the idea? You... that's enough! Those denied entry started making cheaper clones of the original Transcoder and used them to steal the DNA that would qualify them for admission... a crime known as DNA hacking. When the government learned of this practice, they hired private assassins to take out the hackers. Michelle, haven't I always taken care of you and your brother well? You know, word on the street is that he could use the money. My brother, my problem. # Hey, you # # What the fuck is wrong with you? # # Hey, you # # What the fuck is wrong with you? # # Hey, you # # What the fuck is wrong with you? # # Hey, you # # What the fuck is wrong with you? # # Hey, you # # What the fuck is wrong with you? # I'll get you this time. Come on, Jack, you've lost enough of your sister's money. Hey, man, shut up, all right? You're breaking my chi. Come on, Jack, you been gambling all night and you're drunk to the bone. Blow, please. Thank you. - Shit. - Come on. Let's go. It's already morning. One more, one more. Let's see what we got... You lost it all? Crap. All right, all right, all right. - It's not a big deal. - Yeah, it's a big deal! I've got an idea. All right, let's go. - What? - Sir, bite me. No no no, don't you dare. - No! - What do I always say? - We'll win it back. - But we never do. Hey, Randall, I need... we need 60... 60 grand. Who do you think I am, your personal bank or something? Hey, come on, Randall, you know I'm gonna pay it back, all right? You still owe me Hey hey hey, that was the juice. I paid you for the 80. It was double or nothing, you got the double. You've got three days. Any later, and I swear to God, you'll be my bitch licking the shit out of my ass until you choke on it before you die. Not the most sanitary thing, but... I'm not kidding, Jackie. I'm tired of your fucking me around. You understand? You know, what? Consider this... advance payment, all right? What a fucking chump. Let's go go go go. ...leave Olympia are reminded to have your genetic and entrance papers at hand for faster checkout... About time you got back. Tell me you found Christian. Patience, my love. We will find him. You've been saying the same thing every day. I'm tired of hearing you sing that old song. We will have The Transcoder in our hands when we find him. Do not fear. I will not harm him before I see you healed, my sister. You'd better be right about him having it. You're my only hope. Please don't let me die here. I will not rest... until I get The Transcoder for you. Last night, a local safe area turned out to be not so safe. A pharmaceutical executive was fatally attacked by a DNA hacker while dining at a local hip joint, The Liquid Room. The DNA hacker Kenzie Saito, considered a hero among his peers, was killed by a sniper... Police have arrested a suspect. He is now in custody. Jackie! The boss gave you three days. You better have the fucking money. - Ow! - Your fucking goggles. You're a slave, man! A slave with a bad mustache! With interest?! How are we gonna get out of this one, Jackie? I'll think of something, all right? I always do. Oh, yeah? Like the last time when you almost got us fucking killed? Are you dead yet, huh? Then stop whining. All right, just relax and smell the coffee or something. Oh, the coffee that you're gonna need tomorrow for your hangover? I'm not drunk. What's that? Whoa! Shit! Damn it, Mich! - What the... - Where's the money? What are you talking about? Ah! Our savings, it's gone! You've been drinking again, huh? Which means you've been gambling. - God, Jackie! - I've lost a couple times, all right? It's no big deal. So what? You're gambling away our savings. I'm working so hard to get us out of here. All right, sis, you know, that's the difference between you and me. All right? I accept now and the moment, while you... you live in this fantasy future. Okay? Take a look around. This is where we belong. And all of that Chrysanth or whatever, beach talk... nothing but stops there by the way, okay? - Listen. - Who would want... Jackie, look at me. We had a deal. I'm not a kid anymore, all right? I'm just trying to... help out. Okay? Listen, playing our money on craps table doesn't qualify as helping. You're helping out, right? More like... what is it again? Oh yeah, killing people. All right? I'm sure Mom and Dad are real proud of you from right up there. All right? At least I'm doing something that they did. Gambling was what got them killed, Jackie. Listen to me. Don't think that this is easy for me. I lose a bit of myself every day killing and being here. Believe in me, please. Why, huh? You never believed in me. We're screwed, man. Randall's gonna freak out if we don't have anything - for him tomorrow. - I have got an idea. - We're gonna die again, aren't we? - Hey, all right, don't piss around on me, I'm serious. My neighbor leaves every Tuesday... he doesn't come back for days. No. Man, I told you, I'm not doing that anymore. If I break probation, that's it for me. Come on. Pretend you're Robin Hood. All right, he's the rich, we're the poor. Yeah, but I'm on probation. Come on, man. Where's your sense of adventure? You want adventure? You should go to lockdown for three days. - It's very adventurous. - I'm going in with or without you. I'm trying to save both our asses. No, there has to be a better option. - Yeah, like mine. - I thought I said a better option. Look, if we can't find any money, we'll just take something that looks valuable. - Oh, this is all junk. - Take something. I can sell anything. Oh, great. Hey! I'm cutting you a deal. What the hell is this? Man, that thing is the latest thing. People will be all over you for that shit. Worth at least 100 grand. Yeah, but this thing looks like a bunch of junk slapped onto a glove. I mean, what does it do, man? I mean, is it fashion or... Ow! Oh my God! Ow, get it off me! Get it off me! Get it off. Get it, get it, get it, get it! Hey! Hey! Where are you going? Come back here you little crooks! I have... oh, man! You're gonna have to pay for all this shit you broke! Why would I pay for the shit you broke?! Dear God. What the hell is that thing anyway? - Some Chinese finger trap for idiots... - Whatever it is, we're not getting jack shit for it, that's for sure. - I've still got a couple hours. - Jackie, just call Michelle already. You know what? I know another shop. Owner's usually drunk by 11:00. Oh, come on, not another one. My probation officer's gonna fuckin' kill me... - Shit! - What? Oh! Probably just a Chinese finger trap for idiots! I'm not an idiot. I just wanted to make sure this thing was still working. You're an idiot. Why would you do that after you saw that guy get... - You put it on. - I'm not putting that on! Why would I put that on? Failure to comply can result in section C arrest and felony charges which will immediately disqualify you for... # That shit will fuck you over... # # That shit will fuck you over. # Aw, shit. Holy shit! What? Did you do that? Forget it, forget it. Like I have to ask. Who is he? They came for you... three of them. Yeah, look, Mich, I can explain. You don't have to explain. I just want you to know this is what happens when you gamble. And you will get us killed. - See, that's the point. I didn't even... - Jackie, listen. This is not a joke. And this is the last time. Promise me you will never gamble again. You must promise. And I'll forget about it. Cool. Good boy. Let's go. Where? Finish the job. Oh, no no no. Mich, you just cannot go walking... I'm gonna fix this problem. We've narrowed down our search for Christian. He's living somewhere in section D5 of Olympia. I haven't been able to pinpoint his exact location. But we're close, very close. Whatever you do, I'd be careful. If he senses you're on his tail, he might do something drastic like destroy The Transcoder. I doubt that. If he discovers that we're still alive, he may realize that we still have the prototype chip. In that case, he may actually be seeking us now. Where is it? Where is it? Idiot! The online tracker... something came up, what is it? I think our noble scientist has just made a mistake. We've got him. This better be worth my time. Stay out of my house. Those guys came into my house and tried to kill me. Well, you look pretty alive to me. It's just it wasn't you that they were going after. You just happened to get in the way. Now if he doesn't come up with the money, then he's gonna pay in another way. How much? So who the hell are you? I'm his sister. His sister! Well now, I thought I had seen everything. Ow! How much? - 160 grand. - Here's 200,000. This should cover it. All right, sister, that'll do just fine. Oh, wait a minute. You know, I might need just a little more money to cover this dumbass's medical bills. I'll be happy to take care of him. What's up? Shit. Jackie, help me out here. No, just... just leave him in his apartment. I can't. He'll be out for at least 36 hours. You know this is why you're still single, right? Besides, we can't get in without his code. So I'll just call Mouse. No breaking in. He can crash with us. Come on. This is ridiculous. - Hey! - Ow! - Shit. - What happened to your hand? - Nothing, all right? - Nothing? - No, nothing. - It could get infected. - How did you get it? - Some girl gave me a punk bracelet. I scratched it up. It's nothing. Be careful. Come on. I can't just leave him. This is coming from "Pow! Medical bills covered. " Don't you have to be somewhere right now? Nah, Mouse ain't even awake yet. - You're gonna work at my friend's club. - Today? - Well, I had a really rough... - Jackie. Dang. Shit. There's some money on the table. Get some food on the way back, will you? My mattress. # Let your blood flow # # Get your body beat # # Let your blood flow # # Get your body beat # # Let your blood flow... # # Let your blood flow # # Get your body beat... # # Trick your brain to set the score # # Can you take the pain at all? # # I try to understand you, girl # # But you've got to earn it # # Fuck it up and let it go... # Whoo! Look out. Come on. Hey hey, guys. Welcome to Club Metroid. Hey, come on, man! You forgot your tickets. Come on, come on. - Hello. - Listen, you know that glove we found? - The death one? - I'm serious. The guy's looking for it. - He's all sneaking up on us and shit. - God, your neighbor? What are you gonna do? I guess I'll have to think of something. Hey, I can't talk right now, all right? Okay, cool. Bye. Welcome to Club Metroid, gentle... men. Well, Club Metro's got a new hatcheck girl. Come on, man! - I thought we were even! - Oh, we're far from even. I lose three guys because of you. - How will you pay me back this time? - It wasn't me and you know it. But it's definitely your problem. What is this? Your sister give you this too? Huh? You know, two whores in one family, that's not good. Now I'm gonna start to even the score. You've pissed me off too many times, Jackie. So now I'm gonna piss on you. You know, it takes longer to get started pissing when you get older? But you're never gonna know that. I'm serious, I lost the money. It must have fell out of my pocket. You don't lose money like that! I was at my job and Randall, he came into the club, pulled me into the bathroom and then he stole it from me. All right? L-look at my hair. Is it still... it still has shit in it! All right? Does that make you happy? I got shit in my fucking hair. - Coat checked my fuckin' ass! - You promised! You promised you wouldn't get into any more trouble! I'm literally covered in shit! All right, is that what Mom and Dad would have wanted? Jackie, you know - Mother and Father loved us. - No. They were the ones who left us behind. It's your favorite. Mm. Come on, eat up. You'll feel better. What? Nah, I'll probably just fuck it up like everything else. God, I hate it when you say that shit. Just forget it, all right? I think I just need some down time. All right, I'll catch you later. Oh, well. Who the fuck are you? Where's Christian? Who wants to know? The Transcoder. I don't have a clue what you're talking about, okay? Get your hands off me! - Where is it?! - Where's what? The device that gave you these wounds. Ow! Okay, all right! Ease up! Aw, shit. A guy... a guy named Randall's got it. I need it back. What... what's in it for me? You get to eat, shit, live and be merry. Forget it. What? My life's a shit sandwich anyway, man. Huh?! Come on! Shoot me, kill me, do me a favor! The other half when you deliver The Transcoder. But if you can't do it, better make sure your affairs are in order. Yo, Mouse. Hey. Ooh, sorry. Just put it back. I'm sorry. Hey... hey, what the hell, man? - Shh. - What the fuck? Where the hell did you get that? Oh, this? Just from some guy looking for The Transcoder. - The what? - Thing we found at my neighbor's place! Not that... that stabbing thing? Yes! This is only half. We get another - Huh? - No. No, Jackie. No. Yes! This is the real deal, man. And there's a hell of a lot more where this came from. And when we give it to the guy, what, you think he's gonna be cool with us walking? Come on, man. You know me, all right? I need you there. I can't do this alone. All right? I thought you had my back? I do, man, but... it's suicide. Suicide? Huh. All right. You did that on your own a long time ago. W- what if your probation officer finds out about your gambling and breaking into Christian's place... That was all fucking you, Jackie. I got this gig now and I'm digging it. Okay? You freak. What, are you gonna spend the rest of your life working in that shithole? What a fucking loser. You're a fucking loser! And that is all I have. What, did you wake up this morning and decide it was a good day to die? All it takes is one bullet to kill a man. What are you, nuts?! Did some of that shit from last night seep into your brain and make you stupider?! Where's The Trans... the thing you took from me? Well, we've got a problem. I gave it away. Now why don't you be a good little boy and put down the gun and let's... dance or something? I guess it is a good day to die! Whoa! All right! All right, I'll get it! No! Send someone else to get it. You stay on your knees! All right. Are we cool now? Is there anything else that you want? - Lick my shoes. - What?! Lick my shoes! No no no. The bottom. Stay back. No! Don't shoot! I want him alive! You got it? Hey, kid? I'm talking to you. Tracking device. So how did it feel? Don't spend it all in one place. You know what, kid? You did okay. I could use someone like you. The Transcoder is ours. I knew you'd find it. You were right about Christian having it the whole time. Hurry. Hook it up. The calibration shift. Hey. Where the hell is The Transcoder? - Calm down, we can talk. - Give me the damn Transcoder! Put the gun down. Listen, I don't have a clue what you're talking about. Don't play stupid with me. I know you have it. She doesn't have it! - Jackie, what... - His place is trashed, all right! The door was open when I got home. So whoever broke in probably has your stupid thingy! Then why did my homing device lead me straight to the two of you? Under the sink, grab the ropes. This is the second time in a week. Are you going to tell me what's going on? What? Just because you don't have it doesn't mean you didn't have it. What are you not telling me? Nothing! Jackie, this is not a good time to play games with me. Would it kill you just to believe me once? You know what? I gotta... I gotta go. Mouse set me up with an interview. Everything looks good here. Hey! Are you calm enough to tell me what's this Trans... Transcoder. Transcoder is? If you really don't know, then you're better off. Safer. If I were you, I wouldn't be worrying about my safety. Huh. Well? The Transcoder... it's a unidirectional biological encoder. A what? It reconfigures a person's DNA in various sequences without the need for a tissue sample. - You have illegal contraband. - I had. This device could end disease as we know it. It would wipe out the pharmaceutical industry. You take this device, upload the information... - You're a DNA hacker. - Only takes one rearrangement to kill. That's a DNA hacker. But it also takes one rearrangement to heal. And that's a DNA scientist. And that's what I am. This Transcoder is different. I built it to introduce RNA nanoparticles into the body. It's like a... a subtle addition of new DNA instructions. What's so new and so special about this one? It's special in that it doesn't need to sample the patient's DNA to write effective code. It's also the last one. The microchip containing the blueprints was destroyed in the fire. You have to believe me. Ow. What are these? It's The Transcoder. It punctures into the arm to retrieve a sample DNA code. It then sends that code to another host. Since no two DNA codes can co-exist, the results... could be catastrophic. You should learn to do your homework, Solemn. Jackie... is the brother of one of my trained assassins... Michelle. Bring him back! Bring me Christian. The assassin lives next door to Christian. Good. Make things even easier. Don't assume things are so easy, Abraham. I'll give Michelle one last mission. Michelle, details of your last assignment are all in the folder. Bring back this hacker and the tickets will be yours. When we have what we want, we'll leave at once before she realizes that those tickets are already spoken for. I can bring Christian back myself! - We don't need to use... - You'll stay here and look after our sister. Don't worry. Michelle has never failed me. When she gets her mission, we get Christian. Consider it done. Is this the way you usually introduce yourself to strangers? Worse. I can believe it. - The answer's no. - To what? I don't have The Transcoder. I wasn't going to ask about it. Chrysanthemum tea, my favorite. You could've killed me. Yeah, it could be worse. You think I'm one of them, don't you? - One of what? - A DNA hacker. It's okay. Most people do. We live in a world where we're judged in everything we do. You're either this or that, nothing in between. I know what that feels like. You always carry these? - Protection. - Yeah? Yeah. Or... - you're an assassin. - What are you saying? It's not too hard to put two and two together... the way you live. You're an introvert, recluse... secretive. Not to mention your physical prowess and your general knowledge about DNA hacking. You're judging me now? You lead the exact same kind of lifestyle as I do. It's ironic, isn't it? It's like whatever path we choose in this life, this generation has been set up to extinguish itself. I often feel like I'm fighting a losing battle. I know exactly how that feels. Did you ever feel like you... like you just want to get away... from all of this? All the time. I should get back to my apartment. It must be a mess. Hello. Hello? - Get him! Hold him still. - Hello? Hello? Beat your ass! Come here! Keep running like a bitch! Chrysanthemum tea. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm sorry about the time I hit you. Hmm, which time? - DNA hacker... - Scientist, please. How long? Well, we developed the technology in the human genomics lab about 20 years ago. - 20 years ago? - Yes. At the time, you know, our work was deemed too radical. Somebody blew up our laboratory. I suppose it was for the best. What do you mean? Hayden and her brothers were packaging our research as a weapon. It went against everything I stood for as a scientist. You see, Hayden wanted that technology. Now that they've found me, Michelle... it's over. They probably have it in their hands already. - How can you be so sure... - Only they know how to use it. The Transcoder itself is useless without the machine required to upload the information. That machine... the only one of its kind... is with them. Excuse me. Randall. What do you want now? Where's Jackie? Big sister looking for her little shithead brother. Well, I don't have him, but if I did... what are you gonna do about it? You have five minutes to get him. What is it with you and your family? You think you can just call the shots any time, anywhere? What are you going to do? Who the fuck are you?! You came in here. This is my place. - I give the orders... - Take me to Jackie. Shoot her in the fucking head and... Take me to my brother. Now. Jackie? Open the door! Jackie! Jackie. Michelle is taking too long to bring Christian. I've almost cracked The Transcoder's code. It's only a matter of time, my brother. Well, time, my little brother, is something we don't have. I'm just gonna take matters into my own hands. Look, all I do know is that... any time something bad's happened to you... or our family... it's been because of me. It feels like... Put the guns down or he's the first to die. Don't, Mich, don't. Now! Mich! Down. That's it. Now back off. Did you think I was gonna be killed without a fight? Rotten bitch. - Mich! - What'd you say?! Nothing? Where are your big words now? Is little brother peeing in his pants now? Look what your sister did. I want my face to be the last thing you see before I put a bullet in yours. But first, I'm gonna make sure you keep those pretty little eyes open. Fuck! I'm sorry. It's okay. Jackie... I'm sorry. I told you this wasn't... I told you. Mich? Mich?! - Of all the stupid... - Shut up, Abraham. Why the hell did you try to use The Transcoder again? Look what you've done to yourself. What was I supposed to do, sit here and do nothing? What if you had damaged The Transcoder? All our plans would have been ruined. Calm down, my boy. - What the hell are you? - She is my sister. You were supposed to help us! Michelle works for me. I owe her nothing. Or you. Now listen to me. I need you to do something very important. What makes you think... I'd do anything for you? Michelle failed to meet the final requirement to obtain her tickets to Demeter. All that hard work, shame for her to lose her chance now. But you, Jackie... you can complete her mission and guarantee her future as well as yours. Michelle can still be saved, kid. You tried so hard to fit in, to make things right. All Michelle ever did was cause heartache. She doesn't know how to do it. She doesn't know you try. But now is your time to prove it, prove you are a man and not a baby anymore. The world is yours, my friend. All right, all right, all right. Look at me. Look at me. You're all right. Okay. Good. Now does this hurt? Does it? - How did you do that? - I upped your immune system a little. Your blood will regenerate more quickly, okay? So rest up. Come on. That's it. Come on. And then, later on, you can kill me for saving your life. I only found you because of the GPS on your phone. When you'd been beeping for just over an hour on the same spot, I figured something was wrong. Christian. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. Hi. Jackie. Hey! God, man, you just disappeared. What's going on, Jackie? Oh, nothing. I, uh... wait. I... I got something for you. Here. Oh, God, no. You're not gambling again. Hey, no, all right? That's totally legit. All right, just take it. I want you to have it. - No, I don't want it. - Take it. Just use it to get some new gear. New goggles. I missed you, man. Sure you can't hang out a little later? Yeah, no, I... I'm... I'm proud of you. You're the best bro I've ever had. I want you to have a... a good life. Just, uh... don't screw it up, okay? I brought you some clothes. Thank you. You should ease up. I need to get better. I have to find Jackie. I've uploaded all of Jackie's information onto the "M" people list, so if anybody's seen him, they'll call. Well, I can't stay here. What if someone calls, Michelle? Wouldn't you be here? Listen, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. What is this? These are travel documents. I want you to come with me. Christian, I... I would love to. - But I must find Jackie. - And what if Jackie's dead? Well, he's not. I can feel it. Well, if you change your mind... they'll always be here. Goodbye. Jackie. Michelle's been looking all over for you. - Where have you been? - Doing what I needed to get done. Don't make this hard on me and I promise you, this will be over soon. What are you doing? This is insane. I'm living my life that's right. - What are you talking about? - Put him down, Jackie! - Put him down. - What? What are you gonna do, shoot me? Listen to me, I'm your sister. - I know what's best. - No! You don't know anything! You don't know how I feel! You don't know how I'm feeling right now! How'd it go? - We have a job for you. - Go to hell. - No way I'm doing anything for you. - Christian... it's been awhile. I apologize we couldn't meet under better conditions. Josephine... You were expecting someone else? - My God. - You know what I need you for. Give me the code for The Transcoder. In exchange, I will provide to you the calibration shift as a sign of my goodwill. This... this model is made from scrap. I don't know if the new chip is sophisticated enough to... Oh, you know it will work. You can't leave me here. You don't know what I've been through. Still... I don't know if I can repair all of the damage. Just heal me enough so I may leave Olympia and find better treatment. Maybe even continue in our research on The Transcoder. This time, for medical use. I was foolish to think it could be a weapon. But with the lessons I learned, I can use my resources for the better of mankind. You know in your heart, you still have it in you, Christian. Help me so I can help you. Together with me, we can do it together again... right, this time. Whatever happens, I'm here with you till the end. You... you killed my brother. And you just killed my sister. I guess we're even. - Go ahead, shoot me. - You leave her alone. Shut up! I want you to use that Transcoder of yours to bring back the original data code. - You're out of your mind if you think... - I said do it now! Do it or the bitch dies! Fine. - I'll try. - You'd better do more than try. How's this for trying? Christian! What the hell? Don't, you stupid bitch! Hiyah! Michelle. Christian. Destroy The Transcoder. What happened? If I can't use it as a weapon, then no one can. Please don't die on me, please. No! Help me. Please... help me. Oh, Christian, please don't... don't leave me, please. Please don't leave me. I don't want to lose you. Do it for me. I love you. Chorus singing in harmony  Chorus is continuing
