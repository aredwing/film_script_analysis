Give us more snare in the speakers and we'll be all right. Ready to roll. Remember: Do it right this time. I want rock 'n' roll, baby. That's more like it. That's what I'm talking about. All right, my boy. Krush Groove. Yeah, you got it. Get a box, take this downtown. Homey, move it! We ain't got all day. Yeah. That's it. You stay off that car! You're fired! Fired? We quit! Wait! I'll take back the music. Who's going to clean the cars? Those boys are def. They are def. We'll be big once we play the Fever. Let me tell you something. They all started that way. Kurtis Blow, Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde. Yo, once you get on that mike at the Fever, it's like magic! The Fever! That's all you talk about! - So what's the matter with that? - I just don't want to do it, that's all. All you care about is stuffing your fat face, right? Don't you want to be a star? Krush Groove. Yeah, hold on a second. Yeah? Okay, how many? Okay, you got it. You'll get them as soon as I get them. Krush Groove is now rolling. I know you wanted them last week. I'll get them to you soon. I'm sorry, man. Hopefully by the end of the week. Yo, I took 100 orders today. They all want it yesterday! I have 60 more over here. It's happening just like I told you. - Just like you told me. - Right. We're selling records we don't even have. A hit record is the worst thing that could've happened to us. - I don't know what you're thinking. - That's minor. We have no money. We can't press any more records. It's for you, Rick. I'll get the money. Just chill. Trust me. This is Rick. You'll get your record tomorrow. Why do you tell people that? If you're worried, tell your old man to get up here. If not, I'll take care of it. All right? I'm tired of your nonsense. You think this is a joke. Why don't you get out? Just get out. Hey, man, relax. We're getting ready to get paid, cuz. That's enough! Now everyone just calm down and pay attention. Dissecting the fetal pig is very important. It counts for 75%% % of your lab grade. So if you're groaning now... ...keep clowning around and you'll really have something to groan about. Once you have your specimen open... ...I want you to identify the following muscles: Mandible. Let's step, man. This is boring. This is weak. Sternohyoid. Who has a radio in this class? Speak up. Brachialis. It's you. The fat one! Stand up! I said stand up. Oh, wise guys! Report to the principal. What did we do? Out of my class, now! You want to play like that? You all get "F" for fetal pig. Yo, forget that teacher, man. Come on. I got an idea! We ain't got all day. - Come on. Let's go. - What's up, man? Disco Three! It's almost time, man. Almost time. Joey, for God's sake. Turn that box off! If you have no respect for my ears, at least have some respect for the church. It's my new record. What do you think about it? It's a lot of screaming and noise, it's not music. Russell says it's the hottest record. Russell? That big dummy? He dropped out of college in his senior year and you rely on his judgment? Take your hats off in here. What's this I hear about you quitting your car wash jobs? You don't understand. Me and D are stars now. We can't be working at no car wash. You wouldn't see Lionel Richie working at no car wash. Now you are Lionel Richie, and you're Prince. And here comes Berry Gordy. Tell him we're stars. Yeah, my homeboys are superstars now. They got the hottest record on the streets. Sold out in three hours. My boy. How you doing, Pop? Looking good. - I'm fine. - Good. What do you want? I came to see how you were doing. You never put your foot in this church unless you want something. What do you want? I need money. That's more like you. How much? - Not much. - Not much? How much is not much? - $5,000. I know it's a lot... - $5,000! - Nice seeing you. - Dad, hear me out before you say no. Nothing in the world will make me give you $5,000. Just listen, will you? Every time I've got something important to say, you never listen to me. I need money fast. Real fast. I got an order for 10,000 records. If I don't deliver them, everything we saved for... ...everything we worked for is going to be flushed. I wouldn't ask if I really didn't need it. You know how I see this? God is testing you. I think if you do this one thing on your own... ...it will finally prove you're growing up. I believe this to be God's will. I'm not going to interfere with it. Let's go, man. Your record was beautiful. All right. Word up. She's real def. I like that. It's sweet. She's real fresh. Come on. All right. You did it. The record is def. - We did it. - Yes, we did. Can we talk some business? Ladies, take five. I got a sweet deal. Now the record's a hit, there shouldn't be any problem... ...getting the top rap groups together, as long as you make the music. All right. I'm with it. Yo, what's up, man? You did it. The record is great. I'm really proud of you. Yo, what about us? We made the record. Now you can start paying for your drinks. Let's go in the back, have a little Moet, have fun and celebrate the record. I'd like to add my congratulations. I really liked that record. Thank you. Take my card. I always like meeting enterprising young men like you. Maybe I can even help you out. - What did that sucker want? - Nothing. Don't mess with him. He ain't no good. He's out of your league. Who's the girl? That's Sheila. She's a fox. - Where do you think you're going? - With them. That's my homeboy. - Let me see some ID. - ID? - Let me see some identification. - Just calm down, man. Come on, man, hurry up. Y'all just blew up overnight? Get out of here. Step outside, man. Get out. Let some real customers in. Did you hear the audience? They loved you. You were great. Then why am I playing here in this dump? You got to get me better gigs. I can't take it no more. All right, all right already. You always say "all right." I hate it here. I'm trying, but it's hard when you don't have a record. Listen, the best thing to do is to keep working so people can see you. - No one will see me here. - I saw you. You was real def. Thanks. You want something? It's just that me and my man, we have champagne... ...and we got a record out, so chill with us. We'd like to join you for a drink. What's the name of your record? - King of Rock. - "There is none higher." King of Rock? Are you two Run-DMC? Funky fresh in the flesh. They've been playing your record on the radio all day. By the way, my name's Karen. - And this is my client, Sheila. - How you doing, Sheila? You ever heard our record before? Who, me? No. It's been on the radio all day. You ain't got no radio? - Do you like rap? - No. It's not that she doesn't like rap. It's just that she hasn't heard good rap. Why don't you do one for her? She'd like it. - "See, I met this girl - "The other day "And this is what she had to say - "She said she didn't hear rap - "She did not know - "About the devastating two - "I'm Darryl "This is Joe" You like that! - That was funny. - We're funny over here. Could we have champagne? We're a hit with this lady. The men with the black hats. We're rappers. The Disco Three. We're performing here. I ain't never heard of you. Is you crazy? You never heard of us? The Disco Three? We're known everywhere. Buff, give him a taste. Why don't you just give us a break? We won't drink. We just want to get on the mike. I'll tell you what. I'll give you a break this time. If I catch you trying to get a drink... ...the same way I'm rolling you in now, I'm gonna roll your fat ass out of here. - $10 a piece. - What? $10? $10 each. You must be buggin' man. It's wild, man. You crazy? Chill out, man. Be cool. To new friends. To your new record. Here comes my brother. We got more clubs to hit. This is Russell. That's Karen. - Hi, Karen. - And Sheila. - Hi. - I liked your song up there. It was good. - Real good. - Thank you. And you wanted a $5,000 loan? Right. - Do you have any collateral? - We have recording equipment. Its approximate worth? Most of it is used. I'd say it's worth about five... $50,000. It's all digital state-of-the-art stuff. - $50,000? - Maybe more. I'd like to take a look at your books. Did you bring them? Sure. If you don't understand anything, I can explain it. I wrote it myself. That won't be necessary. We got it. What kind of record company do you have? What kind? What type of music? - Rap music. - What? Rap music. What is rap music? Let's just show him. "An insurmountable beat subject of discussion "We can sell records with the aid of percussion - "There's no category - "For this story "We can make lots of money in any territory" Give us the loan. - Gentlemen, I get the idea. - Good. I'm very sorry... ...there's no way I can offer you a loan at this time. - What are you saying? - No. - What do you mean? - Your loan request is denied. Maybe when you're more established... How can we get established if you don't give us money to get started? I'm sorry, but I cannot offer you a loan at this time. That's bullshit. You're going to tell me... - Wait a minute. - Gentlemen... I think this guy's gay. I need six pairs of white-on-white Adidas. Four pairs of red-and-white, three pairs of burgundy-and-white... ...and five pairs of black-and-white Adidas. I can't wait two weeks. I need it right now. I don't believe them. They're fronting me after all the business I gave them. Sneaker genius, we're trying to rehearse. - Rehearse? - Yes. Put a little rapping in, then you'd get somewhere. So what, big deal, you can rap, but I bet you can't sing and dance. - Who? - You. I'll show you sing and dance. Put a beat on, I'll show you sing and dance. Yo, don't forget to sing, man. What's this? You know what I'm saying? - Now let's see you rap. - Anybody can rap. - Go ahead, then. - All right. I'll give you something. Give me one of them sleazy sounds. All right. Lord. Good God. Wait. "Everybody stop on the one, yeah "Give me two "Good God, good God" It's greasy! Wait. It's too funky today. I can't talk. Maybe this'll make you feel better. Wait. I got it. "I can sing, rap, dance in dress-up pants "I can rock your whole world if you'll give me a chance "I'm Sheila E and my R-A-P is the best damn rap that could ever be "I've got a mass appeal, a little girl smile "I'll make you happy, baby, all the while "'Cause I'm bad, good God "And if you got a big enough stick then come here, Run "This is my house Don't you want to learn a new trick "You big koala bean head? "You got any licks?" You real def. We'll put you on stage. Why don't you do this part over for me one more time? What part? Take the hat. Try to act like my man, Diggidy D. Do this one more time. "I've got a mass appeal..." Not like that. Just say it. "I've got a mass appeal, a little girl smile" What are you looking at? I'm just looking at you. See what you want to do with yourself. - Do that? - Let's do the rap. That was a sucker, man. Carmen, file this. Take all my money out of that bank. We don't have an account. We got to think about this together. We got to take our time and figure out something. We'll figure out how to get this money. To press the records, we need the money. Let's think about this as a team. We'll come up with something, all right? Let's work on this. Rick, Carmen. I got an appointment I forgot about. - You can't leave! - I'll talk to you. Keep the change. Jay B! I knew we could do business. How much money do you need? Yeah, we're in a good shape now. - Oh, shit. - Yeah. - Where... - Don't ask. You're rolling with the rush and that's all you need to know... ...cousin. Russell, what's up, man? How you doing? Kurtis looks hot out there. - This rap is really happening. - I told you that six months ago. You did. I'm a little slow, but I'm catching on. I'm tired of this shit. - Where's your crew at? - I told you they'll be here. Just chill. You've been popping that shit for three hours. Run better be here. Man, slow down, man. What's eating you? Why you playing hard to get, Russell? You know I want your boys up at Galaxy Records. In fact, I'm ready to make you a serious offer right now. What? I said I'm ready to make you a serious offer right now. Look at Kurtis go. - How serious? - Look at him. How serious? $20,000 to sign, and then we'll talk about the rest. Come on, Beik. When you get really serious, let me know. I'll tell you what, Russell. I am serious. Number's still on the card. Take it. Go ahead. Give me a call. See you later. - I got them. - Where? You have about 60 seconds to get the kids on stage. - Where you been? - I got some surprises for you. - What kind of surprises? - You want to see it or what, man? Let's hear it for the King of Rap, Mr. Kurtis Blow. Come on, everybody! The King of Rock! Ladies and gentlemen, Run-DMC. - Y'all ready to rock? - Yeah! Y'all ready to rock? Y'all chilling? Before me and D and Jay get started... ...can y'all do me a favor? Can y'all do me one favor? Can you meet somebody for me? Put your hands together for a good friend of mine, Miss Sheila E! We got a deal for one act. I'm gonna pay you for one act. I hear you. I can't hear you, say it! Come on! - Oh, Sheila, you was good! - Thank you. You know, you was real def. Y'all should've rocked those Adidas suits I picked out. You're crazy! I won't wear that! What did you think? It was def. What the hell do you think this is? Don't throw stuff on stage without clearing it with me. This is my show, Run. I run this operation! I decide who goes on this stage. You understand that? Yes, I understand. I'm breaking out. Where you going? I need you onstage. Me and you's okay. They'll tear my place up. Get away from me, man. Start the show. I'll take care of it. Get off me! You can't be dissin' me in front of people. - I'll do what I'll do. - You'll get onstage! Right now. Run, Run, Run! "It's about that time for us to say "That we're Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay" We had a whole lot of superstars... ...on this stage here tonight. But I want y'all to know one thing. What? This is my motherfucking house. When I say, "Whose house?" I want y'all to say, "Run's house. " Whose house? Run's house. Whose house? Run's house. What's your problem? Let me tell you something. You're the problem! You don't understand. The people ain't screaming, "Russell DMC." They're screaming, "Run-DMC." - I hear you. - I know you do. Why don't you slow down? He's right. You've had enough. Is this a holiday I don't know about? Everyone-Tell-Run- What-The-Fuck-To-Do Day? Come on, Run. - Good night. Talk to you later. - All right. Good night. Why you fronting on your brother? He felt what he did with Sheila tonight was great. He wanted you to like him more than anybody else. But you had to dis him. Now everything's fucked up. You hurt him. You hurt him bad. - You finished? - Yeah, I'm finished. You want to go to my place because you expect something to happen. I can't do it. I expect something or I wouldn't say what I did. You're like my little brother. Little brother? What do you mean? Earlier you give me a kiss, now you're fronting me? I'm not fronting you. I like you but just as a friend. Like a friend? You see these girls? I won't listen to this shit. Wait, Run. Sheila, I'm sorry about this. Run's got me a little nervous. I hope I didn't cause any problems between you two. Run and I are just friends and there's no need to apologize. Whatever is between you is none of my business. - I thought you two had... - You thought wrong, Russell. I've had enough fun for tonight. Let me see you home. It's the least I can do. I wish you'd come over to Galaxy. I could get you out there, Run. Yeah? You like this? Limousine, champagne, the works. I'd get you on MTV, a national tour. Sponsorship. You name it. - You could do that? - Hell, yeah. - Straight. - But it's your brother. I offered him serious money... ...to bring you, Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde and Kurtis Blow to Galaxy. You know what he did? He turned me down cold. Real ill. Now, I'm not trying to go behind your brother's back. But a major record company deal doesn't happen every day. And it's your career he's playing with. If I were you, I'd be a little concerned about it. I might not be able to make that same offer tomorrow. Think about it. Cheers, Run. Love to have you. Man, you better stop fooling with Aisha. - Word. - Word, man. Her boyfriend's going to do more than tear them pants off. Shut up, man. Leave me alone. What are you doing, man? What are you doing? Yo, stop playing, man. Give me... Just stop. Give me the paper. Just cool out, man. I want to show you something. - What do you want to show me? - Right here in this paper. It says there's a talent contest held at the Disco Fever. Check it out. It says first prize is a recording contract. Second prize is $5,000 worth of stereo equipment. I'd sure like to win that stereo equipment. What's wrong with you? What've we been trying to do? Get in the Fever, right? Check it out! It says all we have to do is show up and we're in, right? Right. Wrong. I ain't doing nothing. I'm not doing nothing. - He's a sucker. - I just got to be a sucker, that's all. - Real good. What's your name? - Nayobe. - It was real good. What do you think? - She is perfect. Working? All right, fellas. Get her name and number for me, too. No more auditions. No more auditions today, fellas. Next week. I said, no more auditions! You can't come in here like that, man. Auditions are over. Come back next week and we can work something out. Box. What's this? We're through, all right? No more. This kid is def. We'll sign you up. Y'all were real good. We'll sign you right now. All right, call me. Let's go. - All right. - You was going to shoot him. - What's up? - What'd you do last night? Heard you was with some skeezes last night, you got skeezed. Yo, man, where's Russell? At the Fever, judging that contest. He turned down a big contract from Galaxy Records. Galaxy Records? - Where'd you hear that? - I was with Beiker last night. He said he offered him a lot of money for all our groups. Russell turned him down without asking any of us. Get out of here! - How much? - That's bullshit! Let me tell you something. Me, D and Jay, we got to think for ourself. If somebody offers something like this, I'll take it. Because all this shit could end tomorrow, you know? I'll see y'all in a little while. What's up with your man? - I don't know. I don't believe that. - He be illin'. Russ. How's our record company doing? - What? - Our record company. That's what it'll be if you don't get me my money. It's short, but I'll get the rest to you in a couple weeks. Not weeks. You have days. Seven. This little bit of change I'll keep as interest. Get me my money. All of it. Or I'll drop you to your knees, Russ. Put the hands together and welcome the Beastie Boys. Let go, man. Come off it! Stop acting like a little girl, man. Come on, man. This is our big chance. What's wrong with you? I just don't want to do it. You know we can't do it without you. Why not? Because we call it Disco Three, man. Change the name to Disco Two. I ain't doing it, man. You know why I ain't doing it? Because people will laugh at us. They won't laugh. They always laugh at fat people. Who you calling fat? Chill. Forget it. Be cool. Come on, Buff, let's go. Where you going? You won't do it, right? I ain't stopping you. This is your big chance. We can't do it without you. - Why not? - It's all of us or nothing. It's all on you. Tell me something. What's up? I'll do it. Rock, sucker. Let's rock this house! Ladies and gentlemen, the Disco Three. Listen, this is Russell. Is Beiker in? He's not? When he... Beiker! Good to see you! Looking good. That deal you offered me, I can't do for $20,000, like I said. But for $100,000, you got Kurtis, Jeckyll and Hyde, Run, all of them. You crazy? You been smoking parsley? I signed Run and D yesterday. Run! D! Come over here! What's up? Didn't you tell your brother what we did yesterday? Me and D signed with Beiker. You can't do that. These are my artists. Unless you got a signed contract, you got nothing. Wait a minute. You did that? You hit me again, I'll kill you! I'll fly your fucking head. You crazy! Stupid! The Disco Three! Are you ready? The winner is New Edition! Damn, man! Oh, my God! We shouldn't have come here. We got jerked, man. I was checking you out. Come on, chill, man. Look, y'all were good. What are y'all feeling bad about? It'll be all right. I know they'll need an alternate group this weekend... ...to fill in if somebody doesn't show up at the finals. If you meet me backstage, I'll make sure you get that shot. Okay? Hey, Russ, man. I'm sorry. I know Beiker got to you, too. Don't explain nothing. - He offered me half a million. - Don't explain! We go too far back to be arguing like this. We shook hands. We're friends. That means more to me than money. I came to ask your advice. You want my advice? Don't be stupid. Take the money. I guess I was stupid. It's finished! It's through! I'm tired of it. You want my advice? Go to Galaxy. They got all the cards. You're serious? Yeah. Then I'll see you around. Calm down. It ain't that bad. Hey! You guys. Where are you going? You have to pay more money! That was so funny, boy! Oh, man! That was wild! What's so funny? You, fat man. Get out of here, man! Don't get mad. You're fat, we're all fat. I ain't fat, man. What's this? Step off. That's why we got cheated out of that contest. When we're on stage, we're scared to be who we are. We should rap about things that we like. Like food! That's whack. You buggin', that's def and you know it. Don't you like food? - Yeah, but... - But nothing! We're fat boys who like food. Fat boys? Yeah! Fat Boys! That's def. Fat Boys. That is kind of def. Nobody calls themselves fat. From now on, we're the Fat Boys. You with it? I'm with it. Word, I'll be with it. Fat Boys! Unless you got a signed contract, you got nothing, Russ. Get me my money. All of it. I'm gonna have to drop you to your knees, Russ. I think God is testing you. Rick, man! Get up! Wake up! - Listen to me. It came to me last night. - What? We record Sheila and pay Jay B back. Get on. Come on. Put on your pants and shoes. We'll make some money. It's perfect. Come on, man, get up! We got the sound. We got the look. You got to go, Rick. Get up. Come on! Take your pants. I got your shoes. I got your shades. Move! Come on. Hey, Sal, I got the latest from Krush Groove. I recorded this new record with Sheila and it's a monster. I'm sorry, but I can't do that. I can't play your record. What? You always play my records. I got two for you. Guaranteed def! I told you not to mess with him, but you didn't listen. You guys always think you know it all. That guy's a bad dude and I can't get involved. You're really in big trouble. I'm sorry. I can't help you, not on this one. I'm sorry, but that's how it is. What's done is done. Sal, we got big trouble, man. New Edition called. They won't be here. They got a contract with a company in LA. They canceled. That's just one less group. Come on, let them go on. Do this for me. Do it for me. One more favor. But they better be good. Let's go. Hurry up. You go and get ready to go onstage. I just hooked everything up. Word, Kurt? So, let's do it. You got to do it now. Let's give a big welcome, a big Tin Pan Apple welcome to the Fat Boys! Yo, hold it. One, two, one, two. And we said one two. - It's the place to be. - Most definitely. About this time on the M-l-C. We are the Fat Boys. Let me hear you say Fat Boys! Let me hear you say Fat Boys! You know what we need to do? We need to bring some ladies up here. What about Aisha? Our third prize goes to Poet Kid Jazz. I thought you were great. - You did? - Yeah. Do it again! Second prize goes to Chad. Do you know what I could do with this? I could... Save your applause for this guy, the guy that gave it to us was Crazy Eddie. And now, let's get to our first prize, which is beautiful, indeed. This also includes a recording contract. First prize, the Fat Boys. Where are they? Fat Boys. Come on, let go. It's ours, man. Let go. - It's ours, man! - What are you doing? What's going on here? Take it easy. - What's up? - Chad is stealing my stereo. This ain't your equipment, it's his. He won second prize. Where's our stereo? There isn't any. You won a recording contract. Now get onstage. You should be happy you won. Let's go. You, Lip Lock. Here they are, the Fat Boys! - Everything's cool, right? - No, it's not. Play my jam. I can't play that record. In this club they want techno-rock. I already talked to Jay. We want to be sure you understood. I understood. I said I understood! Motherfucker, you don't understand nothing. He wants all the money tonight, or we rip your shit off all the way. You got it? Who is it? Russell. Russell, what's wrong? It's 3:00 a.m. I'm sorry I woke you. I'm in a tight spot. I need a place to stay. Can you help me? - Yeah, come on in. - Thanks. That's the best thing we did yet, man. I'm really excited about this, man. - What's up? We def. - We gonna get paid. We def, right? The record's all right, man, but things don't seem right to me. You know what I mean. Us being here without your brother. You still on that tip. We've always been down. Right from the start. You were the son of Kurtis Blow... ...and your brother was the DJ. It don't seem right that he ain't down no more. Is that how you want to live your life? This is how I want to live my life. Paid. You know what I'm talking about? I produced the record, man, and I ain't with it no more. Later. So what's up? We def, right? We gonna be def. You know what I think? I think Kurtis is right. You've been illin' lately. What you talking about? Nobody illin'. Chilling. If you ill-out on your family, who knows what you could do with us. Ain't nobody illin' on no family, man. I'm breaking out. Ain't nobody illin'. You just be fronting. I want to get paid. - Chill, man. - Chill. Russell? Run. I thought you were Russell. This ain't Russell. I'm glad you're here anyway. - I don't know why I came. - Run, wait. Russell's in trouble. Jay B is after him. He might hurt him. You got to help him. I'm worried. Russell's old enough to take care of himself. He's a grown man. He's in trouble! He needs you. You fucked him! You help him. What are you talking about? I can't believe it. You only think about yourself! Everything is Run. After everything Russell did for you... ...you don't give a shit about nobody. Fuck it, I'll go. - I'll go. - Forget it! Just tell me where he's at. I want to see what's up with my brother. He's at Rick's. I'm breaking out. What the fuck... This is gonna happen every day till Jay gets his money. Russell. Chill. What are you doing coming here with your little fly behind? I was trying to save yours. I was all right without you. They were getting tired. Tired of kicking your butt. - Are you all right? - Yeah. I'm fine. You? Yeah, I'm chill. Listen, I'm sorry. You've done a lot for me. It's really all I can say. That's all you need to say. I'm sorry. I shouldn't always treat you like a little brother. Hold up. Let me tell you something. I am your little brother. Listen, little brother. I hate to bring this up, but since you got this big contract with Galaxy... ...could you loan me a few bucks? You got it. Take it all. I have some more. How about some real cash? I don't want to meet Jay B's boys again. How much? Not much. - How much is not much? - $5,000. You got it. You're all right. What made you stop by here? I went to Sheila's house. She's really in your corner. Yeah, I know. About that situation, me and Sheila... Listen, man... ...Sheila likes me, man, but she... ...likes you. Know what I'm saying? What do you think about being me and D and Jay's manager? Who, me? You got Galaxy, you don't need me. What I'm saying is now that I got Galaxy... ...we got Galaxy. You know what I'm saying? Russell, are you okay? What happened? I got a little scuff. - Are you okay, Run? - I'm all right. I'm sorry I hit you. - Let's go home. - Let's get out of here. Jason, Darryl, and myself is going with Russell... ...because he's the best man for the job. And furthermore, we owe it to him. Ain't gonna be no more hand-shaking around here. From now on, we're gonna sign on the dotted line. Did I cover everything? Welcome to the world-famous Disco Fever. It's all right now. Let me get through here, baby. It's all there. Every dime, every nickel, every penny. I guess this concludes our little business arrangement. I hope you understand it was just that. Nothing personal. Hold up, everybody. Listen up, everybody. Since we're celebrating the success of the contest... ...and our brothers reuniting... ...before they become too big, let's do it like in the old days up here. No stage, no lights, no band. Live at the Fever. The only guy who could do it is my man, Kurtis Blow, the King of Rap. Come on, brother, let's go. Let's go for it. Let's start with the Fat Boys... ...because they won the contest... ...and I want to see how bad they are. Come on up here. Let's get Sheila E up here! Come on, Russell, too.
