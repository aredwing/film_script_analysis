Darling, forgive me. I held myself together through all our good-byes and I've tried to understand, but I still don't know why you should risk your life... you, the best-natured and dearest person in the world. I'll try to remember what you said last night... that years from now, this will seem the greatest adventure we ever had, even though we had it separately. But I have no courage, Tim. You know I have no courage, and I have no vision. And already I'm so very Ionely. We've had at least today. I'll try to keep all the good things as they were. I'll keep the past alive, like a warm room for you to come back to. I promise. I promise. Mother! Mother! - Mother, where are you? - Upstairs, dear. Hello, Mother. Hi, darlings. Are you awfully wet? Jane, such a nice, fresh cheek. Better get your wet things off, Brig. Did Pop get off all right? Was his train on time? It was mean of Pop not to let us go to the station with you. Darling, you know how much he loves you. He didn't even want me there. You know how he hates a fuss. And Louisiana's not so far. And he'll be home on leave before he go... He looked so swell in his cap and uniform, didn't he? I'll bet the others were all jealous. I'd hate a squinchy little father. Pop looks like a parade all by himself. - Did he have my present with him? - Right in his pocket, Brig. I hope he keeps all his money in it and everything. I hope he buys those generals a drink, and maybe he'll be a major by the time he gets home on leave. He can be a major anytime he wants to. Anyhow, he'd probably rather do something else with it anyway, like sending Mother a present or... - Or what, honey? - I don't know. Buy some magazines or books maybe. I wasn't really thinking. I have an idea. How would you like to play gin rummy before dinner? - Okay? - Okay. Let's not. It won't be the same without Pop. Not even gin rummy... nothing! Hello, Soda. Brig, are you never going to get out of this bathroom? Go fly a kite. I wish you'd wait till I get through! If you don't get through soon, you'll brush the enamel off your teeth. You all stop that bickering. It's time you girls was getting to bed. - Hi, Fidelia. - Hello, Fidelia. - Where have you been all day? - Where's your mother? I'm in here, in Jane's room. All right, princess, the mirror's all yours now. You can have a wonderful time looking at yourself. Evening, Miz Hilton. Did Captain Hilton get away all right this afternoon? Yes, Fidelia. He said he'd send you a postcard from New Orleans. What about you? How did things go? I got that job this afternoon with some lofty people uptown. The wages is mighty fine. I starts right away. But I ain't gonna be contentment. I ain't gonna be contentment like I been right here all these years. I'm afraid we're not going to be very contentment either, Fidelia. What's more, I don't know what kind of housekeeper I'm going to make. I can tell you something. You ain't gonna be very good. I've been figuring out this budget. I don't see how we're going to make it. I've already arranged to sell the car. I don't think the government pays them officers enough. I don't see why Mr. Hilton ain't worth as much to Uncle Sam as he was to that advertising company. You'll probably have a much easier time than you've had taking care of all of us. You're not leaving us? Did we do something to make you mad? Honey, you couldn't do nothing to make me mad, no matter what. You're just like my own child. Did I hear something about Fidelia leaving? Now, Jane, I'm just as unhappy about it as you are. We can't keep up the payments on the house just by cutting down on your allowances. Golly. First Pop, and now Fidelia. That's enough of that, Brig. I don't want no mourning. You say good night to your sister and run along to bed. You, too, Jane. Tomorrow's a school day. The Lord Himself will have to take care of these calamities somehow. You'll come to see us, won't you, Fidelia? Of course I will, child. If you don't pick up your clothes, you never will keep a husband. Men don't fancy disorderment. - Good night for now, Jane, honey. - Good night, Fidelia. Whee! I'm a commando! This is all that's left of Fidelia's last cake, and I'm afraid it's pretty stale, but cake is cake these days. I don't care what they do as long as they don't ration pickles. Yes, I know. You'll have chronic indigestion by the time the war's over. Hi, Gladys. What on earth's the matter with that child? Gladys is afraid of grownups, that's all. I'd like to hear her say two words just to be sure she can talk. Who you talking about... Gladys? I don't see how Brig can put up with it. I don't think much of your friends. They're all man-crazy just like you are. It's too early in the morning to argue. Hurry up. You'll be late. You tell Becky Anderson the next time she tries to high-hat me... - Good morning, Mr. Mahoney. - Good morning, girls. - Good morning. - Good morning, Mrs. Hilton. I thought I'd bring the groceries and see if there was anything I could do. That is nice of you. I think I'll need all the help I can get. I hope you won't mind waiting on last month's bill. I haven't received my first allotment check yet, and I'm not a very good manager. I know, everybody's got problems these days. Now, you take me, for instance. I'm trying to get enough of everything for my customers. Would you believe it, Mrs. Hilton... one of them had the nerve to ask me why I didn't go into the black market. - Me, with my boy in the service. - You don't mean Johnny? I wondered why I haven't seen him lately. Yes, ma'am, and he's a mighty fine boy. I've got a picture of him in his uniform right here. I'd love to see him. You're very proud of him, aren't you? Yes, ma'am. There are two things that Johnny always wanted to be. One of them was to be an aviator. And what is Johnny's other ambition, Mr. Mahoney? Well, you wouldn't be believin' this maybe, but it's advertising. Advertising. My Johnny always wanted to be an advertising man. Well, I'm sure he'll be very successful at it. You really think that, do you, ma'am? Yes, I do. You do? Well, I guess I'd better be running along. - Good-bye, Mrs. Hilton. - Good-bye. Mr. Mahoney. I think Mr. Hilton might like to help Johnny get into the advertising business when the war's over. Now, that is an idea. It wouldn't have occurred to me. Mr. Hilton is in the advertising business, isn't he? And I'm sure he'd be delighted. We've always thought Johnny was a fine, intelligent boy. That he is, ma'am. That and a whole lot more. And you've really given us something to look forward to... me and Johnny and the missus. It was very nice of you to come and visit with me this way. Not at all, ma'am. Not at all. - Mother. - Yes? Do you think that I could be a good secretary? Ha, a secretary. Why don't you be a Wac? You could be their mascot. All right, go ahead and starve. See if I care. Dumb magazines. Everybody's got magazines. I know! Why don't we take somebody into the house... a roomer? If you're going to throw away aces, Jane, that's fine with me. Mother, why shouldn't we rent a room? - There's such a terrible shortage. - Go away. Down with five. It's perfectly ridiculous, Brig. A stranger in our home. Where you get your ideas is beyond me. Certainly it's ridiculous. It's Communism... that's what it is. Oh, pooh. We could get an officer maybe. And it might be sort of like having Pop back. An officer. I think maybe she's right. I understand there's not a room to be had in town. It might be very patriotic of us to take an officer into our house. Patriotism hasn't anything to do with it. You're just crazy about uniforms. We should do everything we can for our soldiers. Brig, Jane, now that's enough. Do you want to finish this game or don't you? - 102. It's a blitz. - Turn out the dining room lights. Suppose Pop were looking for a room in some crowded city. Hurry up, Jane. It can't be that hard to figure out. Suppose there was a family like ours that had three bedrooms. Don't you think it would be malicious not to rent a room to Pop? Well, Jane? I won almost $6,000. 592 points at $10 a point. Deduct it from what you owe me. And poor Pop sleeping in the park! All right, all right, Pop is sleeping in the park and the people are malicious and we decide to rent him a room. - Now you satisfied? - You'll do it? I didn't say I'd do it. I'll think about it. I knew you couldn't be mean like those characters in that other city. Come along. I wonder how much we can get for Jane's room. My room? How much will that be for three days? What? Brig, turn that thing off. I can't hear. I'm awfully sorry. Yes. Will this get into the early edition? Yes. Fireplace and bay window. Oh, all right. Put in "homey atmosphere." Mother! Mother! Wait, please! Keep quiet, Brig. Would you send the bill to this address, please? Thank you. You don't mean you're going to rent your room? That's the room that will bring the most money. I'll take your room, and you can double up with Jane. You're not going to put somebody in Pop's room? I didn't mean that. You wouldn't want those characters in that other city to put Pop in anything but their best room, would you? But that's different. He's Pop. Good morning. Is this the place that advertised for an officer? That's right. With the real fireplace, nice bay window, southern exposure? That's right. I haven't seen the room yet, but the homey atmosphere seems okay. I guess it's a deal. I'm sorry, but the room's already taken. Oh, I see. I'm sorry you had the trip for nothing. Yes, I can see you're grief-stricken. Hi, beaver. Good morning. Mrs. Hilton, I presume. Yes. May I be permitted to observe, this is the first house I've found in this godforsaken community - that doesn't smell of cabbage. - Well, it does sometimes. I was given to understand at the office of the Purchasing Division, to which I have the misfortune to be attached, that you had a room for rent. Yes, but I specified an officer. You see, my husband... My name is Smollett, William G., Colonel, United States Army, retired. Retired, I might add, by virtue of certain fatuous opinions held in the War Department which judge a man's usefulness neither by his experience nor his ability, but by the number of years since he was weaned. Soda. There was nothing in the information I was furnished which indicated that you had children and domestic pets. I'm sorry, but they go with the house. We won't discuss it. With your permission, madam, may we dispense with further conversation? I should like to inspect the room. Certainly. Just follow me. I do hope you'll forgive me if I've been long-winded. Not at all, madam. Through a full and somewhat protracted existence, I have learned to accept the natural tendency of all women to be garrulous. You're very tolerant, Colonel. This is an outrage! Mrs. Hilton! Can I do anything for you, Colonel Smollett? - Mother's busy in the kitchen. - Indeed you can, Miss Hilton. You can tell me who had the kindness to leave on my bed this pronouncement from Washington, this lesson in old-world courtesy and manners. I did that, Colonel Smollett. I thought it might make it easier for us to get along. Would you mind helping me with my aquarium? What? Mother's going to use this room. I have to get my things into Jane's room. Now, if you'll just grab that end there... Now you walk backwards and I'll steer you. The big one seems to be the commanding officer. - Don't you think that's intriguing? - Fascinating. It's a little over to the right. Be careful not to shake them. They're very sensitive. You must forgive me if I do anything wrong. This is my first experience hauling fish. Thanks, Colonel. I'll do as much for you someday. I'll tell you what you can do for me, young woman. There are certain elaborate suggestions on page three of this war communiqu concerning the condition, the schedule, and the equipment of the bathroom. - Oh, yes. - You do see? Then may I ask you to follow me for a moment? It was my idea that we should take in a roomer, and I'm so glad the whole thing's turned out so super. Since you are so ecstatic over the whole arrangement, may I ask you whether you expect me to bathe under that? Golly, there's a shower off Pop's room... I mean your room. And is it necessary that your paying guest share the facilities of the house with this vegetable life? You don't understand. This is the philodendron Pop gave me. It needs water. I don't think rain water gives it enough nourishment. Really? As soon as there's no longer any danger of pernicious anemia, would you mind removing that topsoil? Yes, and another thing. I neglected to inform your mother that I like my breakfast promptly at 7:00... coffee, thin toast, and two eggs boiled, 21/2 minutes... under no circumstances more than three. We can't afford to give you breakfast. As it is now, poor Mother doesn't know what to do. When Fidelia was here, the bills didn't seem to be so high, but now... Please. I'm quite prepared to pay. That's fine. What would you say to 50 cents a day? - That seems a bit high. - We'll make it $3 a week. There's the doorbell. Let's call it a deal. Good night. But... Let me see... ...a week for rent... ...for breakfast. Fidelia! This is a nice surprise. I thought I'd run down and see how you all was getting along. - Just about the way you predicted. - We miss you, Fidelia. You just give me that apron and let Fidelia finish what you was doing. Nothing of the kind. You must be tired. Now sit down. Child, would you mind running along? I got some troublement I wants to unburden onto your mother. - You go on upstairs, dear. - I'll come up and tuck you in. All right. Mother, remind me to tell you about the momentous deal I made. All right, honey. - Sit here, Fidelia. - Thank you. You see, Miz Hilton, it's this way... them uptown folks is all right in their way, but it's that lazy trash they got working for 'em. Miz Hilton, I just won't abode in the same quarters with them. When I finishes my work, I wants my solitude and I wants my privitation. Fidelia, I'd do anything if I could have you back, - but things aren't any better... - I knows. Your bills is runnin' awful high. "High" isn't the word for it. But how do you know? I hopes you won't think I'm buttin' in, but I been keepin' mighty close touch, and when I heard tell this afternoon about that Colonel Smellett... And here I'm makin' all that easy money, and I reflects maybe you wouldn't mind renting me my old room. Now, you know I'd never take any money from you. That room was always yours, and it always will be. I figured you wouldn't take my money, so I got it figured out. I can work here on my days off, and nights, too. I'm strong as a horse. Oh, no. You're not as young as you used to be. You're not gonna do any work for us. It'll be wonderful just to have you in the house. Miz Hilton, that's the most beautiful thing I ever heard anybody say in all my born days. If you don't mind, I'll just go get my bag. You shouldn't bother going back for it tonight. It ain't no bother, Miz Hilton. It's sittin' right here. This whole moral breakdown is being caused by drinking and nothing else. They certainly serve rotten scotch at this bar. I should go with what? That's what I want to know. The one I was with sure was a dope. He didn't know where he'd been or where he was going or anything! I haven't got anything against red fingernails, but it's carrying it too far when they paint their toes. I bought six dozen before the hoarders got there. I can't write him everything the baby says one one of those little V-mail forms. Emily, let's not go to the bar. I could use a drink, but... Don't be so old-fashioned. Will you let us through, please? I've been here 20 minutes, and... Of course, go right ahead. I was leaving anyway. He's rather nice-looking, don't you think? Still have your weather eye out? There are compensations for being a divorce. Bartender! - Anne, what do you imagine you'd like? - Anything at all. You order for me. You make a good Planter's Punch? I'll make 'em, and if you don't like 'em, you don't need to drink 'em. All right, then two. With light rum. I knew I had something to talk to you about. That vicious tongue Vivian Robinson with the bad skin is saying you've taken in a roomer. I tried to tell her it must be a relative. No, that's the truth. I've taken a roomer. We need the money. If things are that bad, Tim Hilton had no business going into the Army. To be honest, I don't understand it myself, but I knew that Tim was miserable from the start not being in it. All these irresponsible 40-year-old fathers dashing off into uniform. Does it always have to be Tim? - Tony! - Yes. The eternal also-ran. Emily, do you know Lieutenant Willett? Mrs. Hawkins. I've never had the pleasure, but I've always had a soft spot for Navy men. How do you do? I didn't know you'd turned into a barfly. I've been trying to get you on the phone to tell you that your old lover was back in town. Do you want the whole town to know? If you want to be hypocritical about it. I heard that Tim had been shipped out, so I went to the admiral and convinced him I'd chartered the Great Lakes. Fine. How long are we going to be honored with your presence? Long enough to get ready for a shakedown cruise. If you're not stubborn, that ought to give me the time I need. Don't you think so, Mrs. Hawkins? I really don't know, I'm sure. - I think you believe him! - I can't say I blame you much. You're what I call a discerning woman. Tony's our oldest friend. He was Tim's best man. We can give Mrs. Hawkins the vital statistics some other time. Let's get out of here. I need more privacy. - I haven't touched my drink. - We can get another one. Don't let us rush you, Mrs. Hawkins. Good-bye. - What about the check? - Don't bother, Lieutenant. - I'll take care of it. - That's fine. But, Tony... Good-bye, Emily. That was a terribly rude thing to do to poor Emily. Poor Emily, my foot. Do you know of any place in this gay metropolis where I can conquer my two passions at the same time? You've been leading me on. There is someone on the Lakes besides me. Don't be silly. I'm talking about you... you and a nice thick steak. The white fish, signor, is simply delicious. Grilled. You'll like it. Two steaks, thick. Lobster creole, speciality of the house. - Two steaks, thick. - I must tell the truth, Commodore. We are fresh out of steaks since last Tuesday. This is a steak house. It says right here..."thick Kansas City steak." I can't help it, signor. - There is a war on, you know. - There's a war on, you know. Yes, I found that out. Bring us whatever you have... anything but hash. Bravo, signor. You will be very happy. You'll see. What are you looking so depressed about? My life is an endless series of disappointments... no steak, nobody loves me. You wouldn't think so if you'd heard the kids when I told them you were in town. I can't figure out just what special charm you have for them. They have better taste than their mother. I think they believe you're some kind of genius. Those cover girls you used to paint for romantic tales really gave you glamour in their eyes. Gone are the days. Still, there is a certain similarity between a beautiful woman and a battleship. There must be, or else why would you be so interested in battleships? You got me wrong, Anne. As far as I'm concerned, there never was a beautiful woman but you. Ever since that summer the crowd of us went to the Thousand Islands and I first saw you standing on that little yawl. You had on that white bathing suit. Remember? With your hair blowing in the wind. Why, Tony Willett! When did you get back? - Hello, sugar. - Give me a ring. Yes, I will. I will. We were in the Thousand Islands with my hair blowing in the wind. Really, Anne, that was nobody at all, just a girl I happened to meet the last time I was in town. Tony, you don't have to apologize to me. I'd be disappointed if you ever changed. When we get home, I'll show you something to prove... What do you mean, when "we" get home? You certainly mean to put me up? Probably can't get a room anyplace else. The hotels are jammed. Why do these things always happen to me? I don't see why it should be any hardship to you. You ought to have plenty of room. You think you're going to share my room? The girls can double up. The girls have already doubled up. - We have a lodger. - A lodger? Don't start. I had enough of it from Emily. - We needed the money. - Get a job. You look perfectly able-bodied to me, if I may use the word "body." What on earth could I do? You could do plenty if you really wanted to. Let's skip it. I don't want to hear a serious word out of either of us until I leave. Tony, it's so good to see you. Next to Tim being home on leave, it's the nicest thing... There you go again. I buy you a beautiful dinner, and what thanks do I get? Tim. Tim. What's that? Speciality of the house... chicken hash. Well, blow me down. I think Uncle Tony must be the most distinguished-looking officer in the whole Navy. Admiral King's not so bad. I mean young officers, silly. You'd better finish your homework and stop mooning around. And the governor said to the admiral, "16-inch guns? Land sakes, can't they shoot any further than that?" - Uncle Tony! - Jane! What's the matter? You don't seem very glad to see me. But I am. I am. Honestly, I am. - Uncle Tony! - Brig! That's what I call a real reception. - You're not staying with us? - Yes, he's staying with us. Don't go spoiling him. We're going to have enough trouble as it is. Uncle Tony couldn't be any trouble. It's just wonderful having him here. Don't listen to your mother. I'm counting on you spoiling me. There's just one thing, please. Do you think you and Brig could cut out that "Uncle" stuff? I'm not your uncle. It makes me feel 108. You mean we're gonna have to call you Lieutenant Willett? "Tony" to you, Miss Hilton. That must be the taxi driver with that mysterious object you lugged along. You won't be so indifferent when you see what it is. I don't know what this thing is, but could be the side of a house, I suppose. - I ain't got no change. - Don't worry, I borrowed it myself. Thanks, Captain. Thanks a lot. Say, lady, it sure must be nice having your husband home again. Well, he's not my... What's so funny about that? Lmagine anybody taking you for Pop. You think your pop's wonderful, don't you? - Well, he is. - But you don't have to rub it in. I'll take your bags upstairs... Tony. Don't bother, Jane. - I don't mind, really. - Brig, you take one, too. If we don't give the lieutenant service, he might not stay here. - Aye-aye, sir. - Carry on, mates. Put them in Brig's room. I'll move in with you girls. That'll be fun. Fun, indeed. I thought I was through with dormitories. You'll get to know your children better. Who's that? Is there something gone bad, Miz Hilton? I wouldn't call it anything good. If it isn't my old girlfriend Fidelia. Is that Mr. Tony Willett? I thought we was through with you till the duration was over. Lieutenant Willett's going to be our guest for a while. - Happy surprise, Fidelia? - I don't know about "happy." Don't you let these people turn your home into no boardinghouse. Well, Fidelia! I've half a mind not to stay. But the other half tells me to forgive you. - What's that? - I almost forgot. May as well have the unveiling right now. Wait a minute. I wanna see, too! Let's have a little light on it. I offered it to the Navy. - Tony, I am flattered! - That's mighty nice. Mother, it's just like you! And so pretty. Well, it's really not much. I heard they needed new recruiting posters for the Waves, and I figured that your face was the one that... Tony Willett, I might have known! Mr. Willett, you cover that thing right up this here minute! Jane, you's no business looking at that. Tony, the Navy Department didn't accept it? No. I never even found out why. I got the painting back, and the next thing, I was on sea duty. Red tape, I guess. I hope you're having enough trouble. I wouldn't wish this on a Jap. - Give it a little push, Jane. - All right, Tony. - Nice going, Jane! - Tony, I'm so sorry! Never mind, Jane. I'm sure your mother put you up to it. No, honestly, Tony! - Which way do I take this thing? - Starboard on the port side. - Here, I'll help you. - How you gonna get the bed in? - How am I going to what? - We'll put the mattress on the floor. Don't worry, I love to sleep on the floor. Come on. Good evening, Colonel Smollett. I've taken one of the mattresses out of your room. One mattress is entirely sufficient. Colonel Smollett, may I present an old friend of ours Lieutenant Willett. - How are you, Colonel Smollett? - How do you do? I take it your commission is in the Navy. - That's right, sir. - Doesn't surprise me. We'll get the bed set up in the morning. - I'm moving in with the girls. - It's quite all right. I assume you're taking the one I have not been using? - Of course. - That's fine. Is something wrong with one of the beds? It's just that monstrous animal that seems to be so attached to it. Good night. - Mother. - Yes, Jane? Mother, do you think I have a nice figure? Yes, darling. You have a beautiful figure. Do you think Tony might paint me someday? Over my dead body. Wettookit. Wettookit. - You must have the name wrong. - No. Here it is in Pop's letter. "We're here in Texas on maneuvers... "...in a little town called Wettookit. We came, we saw, we took it!" "We took it." Very funny. I would appreciate it, my dear Bridget, if in the future you could spare me from your father's elaborate puns. I suppose to some people, that creature comes under the heading of "pets." I beg your pardon, Colonel Smollett. There's someone here to see you... your grandson. - William? - Hello, Grandpa! To what peculiar combination of circumstances do I owe this visit, William? Well, you see, I was transferred out here to Chamberlain Field. - I found out at your office... - Indeed? I wasn't aware that the United States forces had been honored by your membership. I enlisted, sir, last summer. So... I don't think we need trouble these women with your autobiography. Let's go into the living room. If you will excuse me. Excuse me. I presume you've come to me for help of one sort or another with your tail between your legs. No, sir. I thought you might like... - You see... - Or is it money that you're after. Speak up, boy. I thought you might like to see me. A very mistaken notion if ever you had one, and you've had plenty, as we're both well aware. After all, I thought that we may not see one another again. I don't know when I'll be shipped out. Come, William. Let's not dramatize these things. There's no need for any pretense of affection between us. You've paid your courtesy call. All right, if that's the way you feel about it. I'm sorry to have disturbed you. You may drop me a line with your address. And if you have any affairs that require attention, I shall have my lawyers look after them. For your late father's sake. Now, I am sure you will excuse me. I'm a bit tired. Good-bye, Grandpa. What do you suppose? I'm going in and speak to him. Mr. Smollett? I'm Jane Hilton. This is our home. I see. I'm glad to meet you. I hope you like the Army. That is, I mean, are you on leave? Just for the day. I'll be at Chamberlain for a while, I suppose, until we're shipped. That'll be nice. I don't mean about you being shipped. I didn't mean that either. I hope you don't think I'm a murderer or something. Grandfather just doesn't like me. I don't think it's right. I think it's just terrible of him. He's not so bad. He has good reasons, the way he looks at it. I've kind of disappointed him. I don't care what you did. You're a soldier now. And you enlisted, too. I heard you say so. That isn't really so very much. Lots of men enlisted. But it's awfully nice of you to talk to me this way. Hi, Brig. What's with the colonel? He's storming around his room like one of the Smith Brothers with a hot foot. I'll go up to my room and do some homework. Hello. Uncle... I mean Tony. Lieutenant Willett, this is Private William Smollett. How are you? Corporal. Engineers, isn't it? - Yes, Lieutenant. - I'm sorry. - You're related to the colonel? - I'm his grandson. - But I don't know, sir... - Think nothing of it. I cut my grandfather off without a cent. Well, Jane, what's the program for this afternoon? How about you and Brig taking me out? William here... or do they call you Bill? ...could make a fourth. That's nice of you, Lieutenant, but I couldn't. Besides, if you'll forgive my saying so, sir, you're an officer... I forgot all about that. You're right. Let's see, Jane, what could we do? Anything you say, Tony. We could have tea in the garden. That's fine. We could play some darts maybe. Thank you, sir, but I ought to be getting back to the field. You've both been very nice. Next time you're in town. Will you be off next Sunday? - How about it, Jane? - That would be lovely. I'll look forward to it. Well, I'd better be going. - Good-bye, Miss Hilton. - It's nice to know you. So long, and next war, come into the Navy. Thanks. Thank you, sir. I will. Well, good-bye. That seems like a very nice boy. - Yes, he is a nice boy, but... - Now, Jane. You take the word of your old Uncle Tony and be kind to that boy the next time he comes here. - Well, he's nice enough, but... - But what? Well, he's so young. Besides, he isn't even an officer. Why, Jane, I'm surprised at you. Those are the boys who do the fighting, and largely for their dreams of girls like you. Far be it from me to run down officers. You go right on advertising us. Every little bit helps. - Tony, I wish... - What do you wish, little Janie? I wish I were 27. Now, that's a coincidence. So do I. Where's that Brig? Do you suppose she ran out on us? I've got a nickel bet with her on Twenty Questions. Good evening, Mrs. Hawkins. Let me help you down. My, but you're strong, Lieutenant! Here, men, help the young ladies. Yes, sir! Mrs. Hawkins, I'm so frightened. There's nothing to be frightened of. Just go in and dance. This here vehicle got Susie Fleming aboard? But a boy named Spencer was supposed to meet me here. Come on. Just go into the cloakroom and they'll give you your nametag. It's like a great big prom, isn't it? Mind you, Becky, dear, leave a few boys for the other girls. Miss Hilton! Miss Hilton! Come on, Jane. Don't dawdle. Will you tell me when Mother and Lieutenant Willett arrive? Just look for me at the committee table and I'll help you find them. Hello, Miss Hilton. May I have your first dance? Well, I really don't know what arrangements have been made. I just can't figure out what could have happened to Susie Fleming. Would it be too much of a favor to ask you to call me Bill? Well, I don't know you very well, but all right, Bill. - Hello, Emily. - Hello, Anne. Hello, Lieutenant Willett! I'm delighted you could come to our little party. I practically had to tie him up and drag him. He was afraid there wouldn't be another officer here. There are a few. You should see Captain Higgs. That profile... c'est jolie. But I do believe you're the only Naval man in the place. I'll bet they give me three cheers and a long periscope. You'll have a good time. Wait and see. I suppose your first dance is with Anne. But remember, the second is mine. That's too kind of you, Mrs. Hawkins. If only I didn't have this charley horse. Naturally, if you're indisposed... I promised Tony he wouldn't have to stay long. If you'll excuse me, I have a number of things to take care of. Emily, would you keep an eye on Jane after we leave? Why, certainly, my dear. I'll devote the entire evening to her. Well, of all the phony battle-axes I've ever met. Now, really, Tony, you asked for that. What am I doing here with all these kids anyway? Why, Tony Willett. When on earth did you get back in town? Hello, sugar. Give me a ring sometime when you're on the loose. Yeah. Yeah. As I was saying, what am I doing here with these kids? That was a cute kid, too. It's just a girl I went to college with. I'll bet. - I'm Johnny Mahoney. - Of course! How are you? Lieutenant Willett, this is Johnny Mahoney. Your father told me you were stationed out here. Dad bores everybody talking about me. He has every right to brag about you. Well, I don't know about that, Mrs. Hilton. I wanted to thank you for what you said about Mr. Hilton helping me after the war. I thought maybe you might think I was taking advantage. I didn't want you to feel any obligation. There's no obligation, Johnny. Anybody who gets you will be very lucky. I'm afraid the luck's all mine, and that's the way it's been my whole life. I guess I have to be leaving now. I thought the dance was just getting underway. I stopped in to pick up my gunner. I'm taking off in a few minutes. It's just a routine flight. - Good night, Johnny. - Good night, Mrs. Hilton. - Good night, Lieutenant. - Good night. Those kids just break my heart. They're so eager. I know. They expect to come back to something. What do you mean, Tony? Something like they left, only better. Hope they don't get too many surprises. - Hello, Bill. - Good evening, sir. - Hello, Tony. - Hi, Janie. Mother, I don't believe you've met Bill Smollett. I'm so sorry I missed you at the house the other day. Thank you, Mrs. Hilton. Your daughter has been very nice to me. Well, that's good. You children run along and have a good time. We'll be leaving soon. Tony, aren't you going to dance with me even once? Go ahead, Tony. Jane, I'm really very proud of you. You're the nicest-looking girl in the place. Tony, do you think so? If only I thought you really thought so. Really, I haven't waltzed very much, Mrs. Hilton. - Would you rather we stopped? - Bill, you invited me to dance, and you're going to see it through whether you like it or not. Of course, Mrs. Hilton. I'm only too happy. I think travel broadens one so. Don't you think so? I hope so. I'll be doing plenty of it. Do you think the artistic life is too bohemian? Indeed I do. And look what happened to Bohemia. - Did you lose something? - Yes, ma'am. Susie Fleming. I'm beginning to get right worried about her. I just love modern American painting. Don't you? You're the true American art, darling. Nobody else ever says things like you. I'm so sorry, sir. My fault. I ought to watch where I'm going. It's all right. We know you didn't mean it. - It's over. - And very nice it was, too. Jane, I think I ought to be behind you. I hope we can find Mother and Tony. What do you think you're doing anyway? I ain't used to dancing. I'm used to pushing a plow. You're not kidding. I bet Emily put some vinegar in this. If you're not careful, I'll think you don't like Emily. As soon as we leave here, you better buy me a drink. That's the least I'm entitled to. Hello, Tony. I didn't know you were in town. Hello, Sam. It's quite a dance you fellows are putting on. - You look upset. - Just got some bad news. - Good evening, Mrs. Hilton. - Good evening, Major. Plane crash. Don't say anything. It might spoil the fun. That's too bad. Where'd it happen? Right outside town. Lost one of my best boys. - What was his name? - Mahoney. - He hit some wires. - Not Johnny! - Did you know him? - But it can't be! We were talking to him just a little while ago. I'm extremely sorry, Mrs. Hilton. I had no idea that you knew him. I shouldn't have said anything. It was just that I liked Johnny very much. - I know his father. - A terrible thing. Beg your pardon, sir. The car's ready, sir. - Be right there. - Yes, sir. I've got to go and examine the wreck. Not a very pleasant job, I can tell you. - Good night. - So long, Sam. Tony, how awful. His poor parents. Lucky Johnny. Come on, Anne, let's dance. Dance? Look, Anne, you'll be hearing plenty of things like this. Might as well get used to them now. I feel so good! Don't you feel good? Well, now, my Susie... she's what I'd call a one-man woman. I love to read books. They're so significant. Why do they call you Wolf? Is that your nickname? You hear what they're playing? Yes. Together. As I remember, you and Tim drove everybody crazy wherever you went, having them play the thing over and over again. Please, Tony, whistle something else. I thought that was your favorite... next to Rock of Ages, of course. Don't joke. All right, have it your way... no jokes. - What is your pleasure? - I'm sorry. You wanted a drink. Let's go someplace. - You feel like it? - Sure I do. Honest? No. Frankly, I don't feel much like it. Neither do I. It's pleasant being in a car again. We used to take everything for granted. Now I feel like a king because I can rent one for a week. - It's one of 'em, all right. - You weren't speeding. Have things changed around here? Do you have to be doing something now before you get a ticket? Where do you think you're going? I wish I knew. What's your guess? Gibraltar? New Guinea? Kiska? - You stationed around here? - Yes and no. I don't want to be rude, but we're not in a chatty frame of mind. Would you mind filling out one of those slips and getting it over with? - You weren't doing anything. - I wasn't? What's all this about? It gets so lonely along this road since gas rationing. Say, ain't it a beautiful night? I hadn't noticed it before, but now that you mention it... Guess I'd better be checkin' in. Nice to have met up with you folks. Good night. Get one of them Japs for me! If I lay my hands on one, I'll give him a ticket. He's what Brig would call a character. It can have my vote. Do you realize we're laughing? Well, so we are. What do you know? What, Tony? Sometimes I wish... How'd you like a cigarette? I'd love one. I don't believe I've had a cigarette in a month. I've never had such a dramatic buildup to a cigarette before. You know what I was just thinking? I like you best when you're not thinking. That's right, run me down. Tony Willett, the jolly fellow. Always good for a laugh. You're not really going to be wounded, not by me. No. If you haven't wounded me by now, I guess I'm impervious, Anne. I would like to tell you what I was thinking. All right, what were you thinking? I was just thinking what fun it would be sometimes to be a good, heavy, synthetic rubber heel. It would be synthetic, Tony. Is it all right now if I whistled Together? Go right ahead. I'd like to join in. I just can't believe that by tomorrow, Tony will be gone. There are enough carrots here to feed a cavalry regiment... men and horses. I think next to Pop, Tony must be the nicest man in the world. - Bridget, please. - What, Colonel? If you'll excuse me, I've had enough this morning. In fact, I think that henceforth, you may operate this victory garden entirely by yourself. Golly, what did I do? Since you're so obtuse... "Tony, Tony, Uncle Tony." I'd better look for quarters elsewhere since that's the way I'm regarded around here. Colonel Smollett, I wouldn't hurt your feelings for anything. It's not a question of my feelings. After all, a man does have his pride. There's the postman. Maybe it's a letter from Pop! You'll wait here, won't you? - Mother! Mother! Mother! - What's all the excitement about? It's a letter to Jane and me from Pop! Well, bring it up. Come on, honey, time to get up. Mother, listen! Pop says he may get leave soon! Let me see! What's that about Pop? Look! - Jane, let me look at you. - What's the matter? Darling, I'm afraid you have the mumps. - Mumps. - Mumps? Oh, Mother! Tony's last day. Only children have mumps. You sure you ain't leavin' nothin' here? Just my love, Fidelia. You afraid maybe I'll come back? I ain't sorry you're goin'. Now, Fidelia, I always say nice things about you. I ain't got no time for them complimentaries. Besides, now that Miss Jane got herself some mumps, we need this room for Miz Hilton and Brig. At least give me credit for good timing. Don't bother with that. I'll take it down. I want to be sure it gets down. I've got a going-away present for you, Fidelia. Here it is. Always remember, a great master devoted some of his last hours to you before he went off to war. You like it? I tried not to flatter you. Why, Mr. Willett... it's just the way I always wanted to look. Someday I'll do you in oil. I haven't much time. I want to say good-bye to everybody. You say your farewells. I'll tote your bag for you. That's very nice of you. Mr. Willett, I must have been stone blind not to see what a lovely gentleman you is. - Leaving, Lieutenant? - On my way, Colonel. I'll tell Miz Hilton you's ready, Mr. Tony. I rather envy you, if I may say so. We could use you, sir. In the Navy? - Good luck, Mr. Willett. - Thank you, sir. I guess we have to have a Navy. - Don't come in, please! - Don't you want to say good-bye? I have an awful disease. Can't scare me. I'm coming in. Wait a minute, Tony, please. - All right, Jane? - Yes. But I wish you wouldn't. Hello, Janie. Hello, Tony. You look fine in that kerchief. Probably start a new fashion. - I look terrible. - No, you don't. You could never look terrible. You're pretty, that's what you are. Don't laugh at me. I never laugh at anybody I love. And I've loved you from the moment you were born. Is that all? It's the best love I have, Janie. It's a special kind of love I keep just for Anne and Tim and the two sweet girls who are part of Anne and Tim. Tony, you're going way and maybe you'll be killed, and I've got the mumps just like a baby. I hope the mumps are the worst things that ever happen to you. I won't be killed. Only the good die young... haven't you heard? And I'm neither good nor young. But, Tony, you're just the right age for a man. Little Janie. Wanna make a bet? What? I'll bet by the time I see you again, you're in love. You're silly. You're the silliest man I ever knew. Now you're making sense. I knew you had a good head. Will you write to me? There won't be anything to write. There won't be anything happening after you're gone, ever. All right. But I'll write to you. I have to go now, dear. Good-bye. - Good-bye, Janie. - Bye, Tony. I'll write to you. I'll write to you all the time. You'll catch the mumps. Do you want to keep them all to yourself? Besides, I'm no hero. I've had the mumps. I'm immune. I wish... Let me wish this time. I wish that I was 17. What are you doing sitting in that holy of holies as though it were yours? I'm getting it used to being just another chair. - Can I wake her up? - You'd better. She'd never forgive you if you left without saying good-bye. If ever I have any children, God will punish me... they'll be boys. I couldn't possibly have anything as nice as that. The first step usually is to get married. - Are you leaving soon, Tony? - In just a little while. Say good-bye to Tony, darling. It's way past your bedtime. I want to talk to him before he leaves. - Good-bye, Tony. - Good-bye, Brig, dear. It's sort of like saying good-bye to Pop again. Coming from you, Brig, that's the compliment to top all compliments. I'll have another kiss on that. - Your cab's here, Mr. Tony. - Thank you, Fidelia. Would you ask him if he'd mind waiting? I got it all arranged. He's waiting. Good-bye, Tony. Come back soon. Good night, Mother. Good night, darling. - Don't catch those mumps. - What do you think I am, a child? - Happy dreams. - Happy landing. - Bye, Mr. Tony. - Good-bye, Fidelia. I'll take myself along now before I... Just when did you captivate Fidelia? It was my art that did the trick. I sketched her. As a Wave? Sometimes your ingratitude saddens me. - You'll recover. - I've got to leave in three minutes. Tony, I'm so sorry to see you go. We've all loved having you. By the way, how did you leave Jane? With the mumps. And with tears, I'm afraid. I haven't much tact, I guess. I didn't know what to say. I know. Poor dear. But you are very attractive, Tony. - A bone from Mrs. Hilton. - No, I mean it. It won't be too easy for Jane, getting over it. Nonsense. Older men... every girl goes through it. Didn't you? - Still going through it. - Yeah. Older men named Hilton. Don't you ever worry about Jane. I won't, as long as the older men are like you. You know something, Anne? I'm chump enough to go on living on your compliments for the next six months. Like a camel and water, you know? - How long can they go? - I never knew one. Tony, don't tell me any secrets, but is it action this time? Down the St. Lawrence, and then I don't even know myself. - I won't say what I feel. - No, don't. You'd better get some rest. You look tired. I will. I have a little letter-writing to do first. I see. How often do you write him? You won't think me foolish if I tell you? I try to write at least a few lines every night. You know that's a little nuts. It's pretty wonderful, too. Well, good night, Anne. Good night, Tony. Come here. You're a swell guy, Tony. Go away. Well, she finally hit one. Now don't drop it. Bowl it. It's no use, Bill. I'll never learn. Sure you will. - I hurt my thumb. - I'm so sorry. Let me see. It's your turn now, Bill. Let's see if you can knock them all down. Well, I don't know about that. Like a piece of tape? Thank you. It's your turn now, Jane. I was just... He just gave me a piece of tape. - Hi, buddy. - Hi. - Have a smoke? - No. I'd advise you to mind your own business. I know she's a nice girl. Anybody could see that. I don't like your laughing either. Bill, please come down and show me again how to do it. Look, buddy, you can have a fight if you want it, but I was just trying to be friendly. Well, all right, then. - Bill, speak to me. - Gee, I'm sorry. - Look what you've done. - I didn't do anything. I guess that'll teach him. You know, I've never been to the beach in my whole life. - I've never seen the ocean. - You haven't? I never saw it till a couple of months ago. But you're a sailor. - I was brought up on a farm. - I see. - I've never been on a farm. - You haven't? I was brought up on an Army post. I see. I have to catch a train. Gotta be back at the base in the morning. Sure wish you could spend the rest of the evening with us. No, you don't. I've butted in enough already. - No, we loved meeting you. - Sure we did. I'll catch a bus here. - So long, buddy. - Good-bye. You've both been swell. You're the only people I met since I came to town. Why didn't you go to the canteen? They're so crowded and everything, and I don't dance so very good. You and me both. Next time you come to town, maybe we can all go bowling again. Gee, I don't know if I'll ever be back this way. I expect we'll get going any day now. The war looks pretty good, doesn't it? It sure does. Well, good-bye, miss. My name's Harold E. Smith. I'm Bill Smollett, and this is Miss Hilton. - How are you? - Jane's my first name. - Good-bye, Jane. - Good-bye. - Bye, Harold. - Hal. Bye, Hal. - He's nice. - Yeah, he's a nice fella. You were sweet to him, Bill. I'm sorry about... I acted like a fool. - He's good-looking, isn't he? - Is he? I hadn't noticed. - You must have noticed. - Well, I didn't. Come on, let's get a soda. No chocolate. We only have vanilla flavoring, but no ice cream. - Would you like Victory Punch? - What's that? It's a loganberry phosphate with lime. - That sounds fine. - We'll make it two. But you could have a vanilla soda without any ice cream maybe. That's right, I could, couldn't I? I'll try it. One Victory and one vanilla soda with no ice cream. - Do you mind if I smoke? - Of course not. Bill, why are you so... so timid about things? What do you mean, Jane? I mean about asking if you can smoke. Nobody else does that. And, well, I mean everything. Is it... I hope you won't think I'm being forward, but is it something to do with your grandfather? No, it isn't that. Although I suppose I've always been sort of scared of Grandpa. But why? I dug up a scoop of vanilla ice cream for you. Please pay the cashier and buy war stamps with your change. I will. You see, my father was a soldier. He was a colonel when he died. I guess all the Smolletts all the way back were soldiers. One of them was with Washington at Yorktown. Although sometimes I think Grandpa just made that one up. I'm sure he didn't. You ought to be awfully proud. I'm proud, all right. But something went wrong with me. Mother died when I was born, so I never knew her. Of course I never knew her. That's a shame. She could paint pretty well... china and things. I hope I can show you her work sometime. That is, if Grandpa... If Grandpa what? Well, if I go home. You see, I haven't lived home since West Point. West Point? You don't want to hear all about this, do you? Not if you don't want me to, Bill. But I do, of course. There's no one in the whole world that I'd rather tell. Isn't your soda all right? Yeah. I just don't feel much like it. I thought I did, but... You don't have to drink it, Bill. Would you rather go home and talk? We could sit on the porch. Swell. I'd like that. So would I. There. Now we can relax. You were talking about how your grandfather wanted you to be a soldier. Would you like a sandwich or something? He wanted me to be a general. But didn't you want to be a general? Well, no, I didn't. But why not, Bill? I had an idea it was more important to build things. I don't mean it isn't important being a soldier. I don't know how we'd keep the things we build without them. But you said you went to West Point. I should think you'd be a lot more than a... More than a corporal, you mean. Let's have a picnic sometime. I'll bring a... Bill, I didn't mean that. It's wonderful being a corporal. No, you meant that if I went to the Academy, I ought to be more than a corporal. Well, you might as well know it. I was kicked out and I broke Grandpa's heart. I'm sure it wasn't your fault. Yes, it was. Bill, come and sit down. Look. Grandpa's father carried this watch at Vicksburg. Grandpa gave it to me on my tenth birthday. He had it engraved for me. Read it. I'll light a match. "To William G. Smollett, the Second, who will lead men to glory on the battlefield." You must have been terribly pleased. I said, "Grandpa, don't people hurt each other in war?" You see, I was only ten. He took the watch away from me. But he gave it back to me again when I entered the Academy. Jane, I did my best, but I could never make a good officer. I can't lead men, and I know it. Even if I'd led my class the way Grandpa... "Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa." What about yourself? Why is it so important that you satisfy him, the old... Because he loved me so. Yeah, I'm sure he did... once. But all through military school, from the time I was eight, I kept letting him down. I never even wanted to play with the tin soldiers he gave me. Grandpa kept telling me that if I was a Smollett, I'd... But I guess I was always... well, you know... weak. I was a joke at the Academy. I only lasted a couple of months. Grandpa couldn't face his old cronies. Well, that's it. Now you can see what a mess I made out of everything. You've done no such thing. You're fine and strong, but you're just sensitive... that's all. But don't you think I'm a failure after everything I've told you? A failure? Just because you're not an officer? An officer I know said that you are the boys doing the fighting. - Lieutenant Willett? - Yes. You think a lot of him, don't you? Of course, but what's that got to do with it? You're a soldier, and I'm... that is, we're proud of you. And I hope you never get promoted. All those officers strutting around with their gold braid and everything. Gee, Jane, I'm so glad you feel that way about it. But Grandpa... Bother Grandpa! There's Soda. You'd better go before we wake the colonel. He doesn't scare me. Not anymore, he doesn't. Jane, let me stay long enough for just one cigarette. All right. Provided you don't ask my permission to smoke it. I won't. Gee, Jane, I think you're wonderful. "21/2 minutes... under no circumstances more than 3." Sometimes I think six minutes would be more in character. I'll serve the colonel his breakfast this morning, Mother. What's wrong with you this morning anyway? First you get up an hour early... ...and then suddenly you've turned into Mother's little helper. I don't know. I just felt like it somehow. Not that I object. The next time Brig makes a deal, she can put it into execution herself. You don't mind waiting for our breakfast until Brig gets down? Two sets of breakfasts are about all I can handle. Mother, do you like Bill? Yes, of course. I think he's a very nice boy. A little shy. Did you have a nice time last night? If he's shy, it's that colonel's fault, the old goat. That's not a very nice way to talk. Well, he is. He's just ruined Bill, that's what. I'm going to have a talk with him. - I wouldn't do that if I were you. - Why not? Somebody's got to talk to him. It's usually a good rule to stay out of other people's business. But maybe it's better if you learn the hard way. Go ahead if you want to. You're not a baby anymore. Just think, in another week, I'll be graduating. Mother, may I get a war job? You certainly may not. You're going to college. College. But all the girls are talking about getting war jobs. I promised your father and myself that all the things we planned for you are going to come true, war or no war. - But I want to do something. - We're doing all we can, dear. Pop is fighting so that you girls can continue... It is three minutes after 7:00. Here. - See what I mean? - Yes. Oh, dear. Here, give him his breakfast. And tell him anything you want to. The old goat. Good morning, Colonel Smollett. Looks like a fine morning. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Where is Superman? I beg your pardon? Pages 9 to 12 inclusive are mysteriously missing. - Where's the other one? - Brig? It's a little early for her. The other egg. That's the only one we have. There's getting to be a shortage. I guess the hens are... busy with war work. Coffee. Do you mind being talked to at breakfast? I most certainly do mind. - It's about Bill. - About whom? Bill. You remember, your grandson. Yes, indeed, I do remember. What about him? He's a nice boy. A most interesting observation, Miss Hilton. I'm afraid you don't understand him. He really needs you to help him, like a mother. He has an inferiority complex, and... Young woman, I have handled men for 35 years, and I don't think I require any instructions on the subject, least of all about my own grandson. I was only trying to help. He respects you so much. Then I'll thank you to do the same and stop your intrusion in my affairs. If you only knew the first thing about psychology, you'd know better than to try to browbeat him. Colonel Smollett, if you'd only listen. You may advise your mother that henceforth I shall have a decent breakfast downtown for 40 cents! I think you're a rude, mean, horrible old goat! Mother! Oh, beautiful for spacious skies For amber waves of grain For purple mountains' majesties Above the fruited plain America, America God shed His grace on thee And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea It is now my pleasure to introduce the class president... Miss Becky Anderson. Class president! Class pinup girl... I heard all about how she got elected. That's not fair, Brig. Becky's a very bright girl. Becky's one of the brightest and most attractive girls in town. I wouldn't go so far as to say that. No, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, my subject for this occasion is women's place in the war. Golly! - There's Pop! - I see him! - Where? I don't see him. - He was in a jeep. You imagined it. - No, honestly. - Yes, Mother, really, it was Pop. Why did I fall asleep after staying awake through that double feature? Let's wait and see it again. - Quiet. - Be quiet yourself. I beg your pardon. - Mr. Mahoney. - Good evening, Mrs. Hilton. - Sit down. - I'm sorry. - How are you, Mr. Mahoney? - I'm fine, thank you. - Hello, girls. - Good evening, Mr. Mahoney. Jones City, Nebraska, turns out to greet Sergeant Tommy Blair of the Army Air Forces. Tommy, seated between his proud father and mother, joyfully receives the plaudits of his hometown. - You say it's animal? - That's right. And its home is in the Middle West. And it makes a noise like a lion but it puffs like a locomotive. Better give up. You agreed if you hadn't guessed it by the time we got home... I know... it's Soda. No. Brig guessed that long ago. All right, I give up. It's Colonel Smollett, silly. Mother! What's that? - Mother, what do we do? - Is he dead? - It's Bill! - Goodness. Bill Smollett, what were you doing there? The poor boy was just guarding the house. I guess I just dozed off. - You scared us half to death. - I'm sorry. Won't you come in just for a moment? Jane has to get to bed. Mother, may Bill and I take a walk for just five minutes? All right, Jane. Make it ten minutes. But remember, that doesn't mean an hour. - Thank you, Mother. - Good night, Mrs. Hilton. Thanks. Good night, Bill. Gee, I'm sure sorry I missed your graduation, Jane. It's not your fault you couldn't get off. - I would've if I could've. - I know you would've. - Shall we go this way? - That would be fine. - Or this way? - Okay. No, I think the other way is better. - How are things at the field? - They're fine, thank you. - How's everything with you? - Just fine. I want to get a war job, but Mother won't let me. I think she's right. You ought to stay home... No, it isn't that at all. Mother wants me to go to college. Gee, that would take four years, wouldn't it? If I go. - You don't want to go? - No, it's so silly. If I were three or four years older, I could be a Wave. Or a Wac. Or a nurse. That's what I'd rather be most. That would be swell if I was wounded. You shouldn't say such things. I won't be wounded. I'll be killed. Jane, would you care? Well, of course I'd care, silly. - Well, gee, that'd be fine. - What would be fine about it? Well, I thought that if... What I mean is I would be glad if you were sorry if I were killed. What good would that do if you were dead? Yeah, I guess you're right. I don't ever want to hear you talk like that again. Okay. I'm sure sorry I missed your graduation. The ten minutes aren't up yet. - What's the matter? - A wire from Pop. From Pop? Is anything wrong? He's gonna be someplace for an hour between trains and wants us to meet him there. Hurry! We have to catch a train! Show your tickets, please. - Did I get your ticket? - Yes. My daughters are back there. If we keep stopping, I'll miss the biggest deal of my life. Well, I'm in no hurry. I've got plenty of time from now on. Tickets, please. Yes, I got yours before. My husband's never even seen the baby. - Did I get your ticket? - My mother has it. I think babies are just about the cutest things there are. - What's his name? - Dwight Eisenhower O'Brien. - And after the Germans came... - Tickets, please. And after the Germans came, we did not get any milk or any meat at all. Serving only two meals a day on these trains is outrageous! Tickets, please. Can't we do anything to get this train going? Those supply trains have the right-of-way. We're going to meet my pop! He's in the Army. If this train is late, we may not see him before he leaves! Don't you think those tanks had better get through if you want him to come back? Captain Hilton! Captain Timothy Hilton! Well, he said the lobby. Sorry, ma'am, he didn't answer the page. I can't imagine... Oh, here. What'll we do? We're so late. - Thank you. - Thank you, ma'am. Sorry, there's nothing available until October. Are you sure there's no message for Mrs. Hilton? I'm quite sure, but I'll look again. Maybe he hasn't gotten here yet. - Pop's always so dependable. - It wouldn't be his fault, silly. - You have the right hotel? - Yes, definitely. Yes, here it is... "Mrs. Timothy Hilton." No, I'm sorry. We're all filled up. I can't help it if he is with the OPA. - We missed him. - Mother. "I know you'll understand how heartbroken I am "that my orders wouldn't permit me to wait. Kiss the kids for me." - Is there something wrong? - No. No, thank you. "The only address I can give you is APO number 805, care of Postmaster, San Francisco." Army Post Office. Mother, that means we won't be seeing him before... Oh, Mother! No, no. Sorry. No reservations until October. I'm afraid she's awfully heavy for you. Oh, no. She's so like my granddaughter. I love holding her. Is she about the same age? No. Mary is almost 30 now. She's a nurse. Let me show you her picture. She's pretty. Where is she now? I really don't know. You see, she was at Corregidor. I'm so sorry. Mother, won't you let me do something now? Jane, please, darling, not again. I'm so hot and so tired. Just for the summer. I could be a nurse's aide maybe. - All right, Jane. - Gee, Mother, that's swell. But remember now, just for the summer. I embrace the code of the Nurse's Aide. I will do everything in my power to bring comfort to the ailing and the wounded of whatever color, race, or creed. I will accept no compensation and seek no reward, and I will hold as a sacred trust the symbol of mercy which I wear... the Red Cross. "Tell Jane I'm proud of my little Florence Nightingale, "and she must hold the thought that next summer, or the summer after that, we'll be boating again on the lake." The summer after that... "And tell Brig that her candy is all the sweeter because she made it. "But I'm worried about your ration points. You mustn't waste them on me." Waste them on Pop? He's thinking of us, darling. "We get everything we could possibly want. "And don't tell Fidelia, but the grub is wonderful. "I'm gaining a pound a week, and if it doesn't stop soon, "they'll have to make me a general just for appearance's sake. That's all for tonight, except..." - Except for what, Mother? - The rest is to me. Mother, I want to hear it. Can't I have any privacy at all? It's just for Mother, Brig. Didn't you hear? All right. You can hear it. It's not that secret, silly. "That's all for tonight, except to say "that come war, come jungles, come Japanese, "they're all so easy to take "because at the end of this, my darling, I know there waits for me your love." There. Are you satisfied? I think I'll go to my room, Mother. I thought we were going to try those new hairdos from Vogue. Would you mind if we didn't? There's a pamphlet I want to study on third-degree burns. All right, darling. We can try them, Brig. I think it's time something was done about your hair anyway. If you want to, Mother, provided you'll let me... Don't start making deals with me. How old do you think I could look if my hair was up? Well, let's see. I should say just about the same age. But nicer, maybe. Why? Mother, it's just terrible... my not doing anything about the war at all. You've rolled bandages, you've collected salvage, and you've sold more war stamps than any girl in your class... not that that's any surprise to me. - But that's all kid stuff. - It's no such thing. I know it's important, but... Mother, I miss Pop something awful! I know, honey. So do I. - Thanks, toots. - Ice cream? Ice cream again? Sure wish I had some watermelon. Now, you men watch Joe carefully. All it is is learning how to walk again. Thanks. - Got any tutti-frutti? - Sorry, we only have vanilla. Gee, we never have no tutti-frutti. Wake up, Miz Hilton. Wake up. What is it? It's almost time for dinner. Wake up. Where's Mr. Hilton? Mr. Hilton? I guess I must have been dreaming. You sure was sleeping hard. - Aren't you home early? - Yes, ma'am, a little. I got a new union rule for myself... 6:00 quitting. Unless I likes people. - Is that for me? - Yes, ma'am. That's why I woke... What's the matter, Miz Hilton? What is it, child? Jane, Brig, come quick! ...I pray the Lord my soul to take. And God bless Pop and Mother and Jane and Fidelia and Uncle Tony and Soda. And please, God, make Pop safe. I know he is safe. You wouldn't let anything happen to him. But please, make him safe anyway. Amen. Make Pop safe. Are you awake? Yes, Brig. Do you mind if I get into bed with you? No, I don't mind. Don't let Mother hear you. He'll come back to us. He'll come back. Wipe sorrow's tears away Nor let me ever stray From Your side In these troublous times, when many of our loved ones are making the supreme sacrifice, I've searched the Holy Scriptures and my heart for some message of comfort and inspiration to you. On other occasions I've quoted from St. John and the prophet Zechariah. I've reminded you of the 23rd Psalm... "Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me." Today I offer you the words of a Maryland lawyer of another day, when Americans were fighting to preserve their sacred heritage of liberty. "O thus be it ever when free men shall stand "between their loved homes and the war's desolation. "Blessed with victory and peace, "may the heaven-rescued land praise the power "that hath made and preserved this nation. "Then conquer we must "when our cause, it is just. "And this be our motto... In God is Our Trust." Those words have become the last stanza of our national anthem. Bye. - Jane, you know what? - What? Gladys' stepfather is 4F. Jameson's a nice old duffer, but I don't know why we have to have all that flag-waving. How's everything going with you, Emily? Still having a good time, I hope. You know me. "Carry on," is my motto, "come what may." You're one woman who can be depended upon to maintain her standards in these times. - Thank you, dear. - Hello, Mary. - I was so sorry to hear about... - Thank you. I've been meaning to call you, Anne. Really, I have. I just heard the other day about Tim. - I'm terribly sorry. - Thank you, Emily. But you mustn't give up hope. C'est la guerre. By the way, that's a very cute frock you're wearing. I remember admiring it last year. - No, the year before last. - Really? You never were much interested in clothes. Well, I must run along now. - Good-bye, girls. - Good-bye, Mrs. Hawkins. I don't like the way Jane's looking. And, dear, if you run into difficulties about your food, I have a cold storage pantry just filled with goodies. We do beautifully on our points. If everybody had my foresight, there wouldn't be any shortages. Good-bye, dear. Give me a ring sometime. I am so sorry about Tim, but he may turn up yet. Yes, you never can tell. Good-bye, Emily. What are we going to do this afternoon? - Did I say anything to... - Could we go to the movies? How do you feel about it, Jane? That child... can't she do anything but hiss? I'll go see what she wants. There's a concert today in the park, the last of the season. Or does the idea of listening to music bore you? Well, the fact of the matter is... Yeah, I think a concert sounds good. Don't you, Jane? Well, I don't know, Bill. If you feel like some music. Or would you, by some remote chance, like to be alone with each other this afternoon? - No, Mrs. Hilton. - No, Mother, honestly. We thought it might be nice if we went out to the country. Would you mind if I went to Gladys' for the afternoon? Darling, you run along if you want to. See if you can teach her some semaphores. - Bye, Bill. - Bye, Brig. You see, Mother, Bill's leaving tonight. He's been transferred to... what'd you call it? ...a staging area. I didn't know. Do you know where? - Well, yes, but... - Of course you can't say. - Or whether you're going to come back. - It'll be the last stop, I suppose. Isn't that awful, Mother? - I'm sure it's what you want, Bill. - Yes, ma'am. - If it weren't for... - May I see Bill off, Mother? You see, I don't have to go back to camp. I'm catching the Pathfinder at midnight. May I please, even if it is late? Of course, provided I can, too. - Would you? That's wonderful. - Mother, you're so sweet. - You almost knocked me over. - Will you have supper with us? No, thank you. I have a million things to do. I'll see you at the train. So long, kids. Gee, she's nice. - She's so lonely, Bill. - Yeah, I know. - Having difficulties, Colonel? - Hello, Mrs. Hilton. Do you know where I might get some shoe polish that isn't made of old sausage? I wish I could get some sausage that isn't made of old shoe polish. Speaking of sausage, could I fix you a cold lunch? That would be very nice. Very nice indeed. I had intended going downtown, but I was a bit tired. You mean you haven't had any breakfast? No. The fact of the matter is I don't like breakfast on Sundays. But why not? Oh, I see. You mean that since you called off your deal with us for breakfast... You sit right down over there. I'll have it ready in a jiffy. This is kind of you. I'd better clean up a bit. - Why don't you do it right here? - Thank you. I'm very sorry I had that little run-in with your daughter. Jane? It was her fault, I'm afraid. That may be, but there was no excuse for my own boorishness. Let's forget it, shall we? - Salad and milk? - Fine, fine, anything. Mrs. Hilton, I would like to say that I admire very much the manner in which you've taken the news about your husband. I'm afraid that underneath, I'm perhaps not quite so courageous. Then it's all the more admirable. Fortitude is easy when there's no feeling. - Aren't you having something? - I'm not hungry. - Colonel, may I say something? - Anything. I think it's a pity about you and Bill. He's a wonderful boy. I can tell you that. He's so hungry for affection. He's like a lonely puppy. Time he got over his puppyhood, I should say. - Bill's going to be a splendid man. - Perhaps, perhaps. Blood may tell in the end. He's leaving tonight. Going into combat duty, I imagine. Is that so? Jane and he are spending the day together. He's taking the Pathfinder at midnight. I have an engagement tonight. That's too bad. Your grandson's going off to war. But I don't suppose that's of any importance to you. If you'll excuse me. I don't want you to think that I'm any more ruthless than is the case. I do have an engagement, an important one, with a British Army mission that's only here for the day. Here's the wire from them. There's nothing I can do. I'm terribly sorry. I'm sorry for Bill and for you. Perhaps I can finish in time, in which case... - You'll be at the station? - I'll try. I'll try my best. But if I can't, would you... Would you wish the boy luck for me? Of course I will. It'll mean a great deal to him. And thank you very much for the lunch. Will you give us another chance at breakfast? On the house. Of course I will. Delighted, I'm sure. Good afternoon, Colonel. Wonderful woman. Wonderful woman! Was a farmer, had a daughter And her name was Clementine Light she was and like a fairy And her shoes were number nine Oh, my darling, oh, my darling Oh, my darling Clementine You are lost and gone forever Dreadful sorry, Clementine I was thinking how much fun it would be to stay out here always, just like this. Just the two of us. Bill, if we only could. I wonder how this thing works. Something up there on the tractor, I guess. I think I'll try it. This looks like a cinch! Sit tight and I'll give you a ride! Bill, be careful! Bill, stop! The farmer in the dell, the farmer in the dell The farmer in the dell, the farmer in the dell Hi-ho the merry-o The farmer in the dell Say, Jane, we'd better get out of here! Where are you? I'm right here, you darn fool. Jane, I'm sorry. What happened? We'd better get inside someplace before it starts to rain. Come on, Jane. Oh, boy, we certainly made it just in time! How will we get home if this keeps up? Must be almost 7:00. Well, what do you know? You guessed it! It's just exactly 18 minutes to 7:00. Only five hours more. I almost forgot for a little while. I didn't forget, not for a minute. I've thought about it all day long. Well, gee, I never thought anybody would care about me... anybody like you. Jane, I don't want to leave you. It won't be for long, darling. It might be for months, or for years, maybe. It doesn't matter. I'll be thinking about you all the time. Someday the war will be over. Then we can be... - Then we can be married, Jane? - Do you want to be, Bill? Oh, darling. I'm so happy. I just can't believe it. I just can't. I love you. I do. I love you, I love you. I just don't understand it. Bill, do you realize we're engaged? Engaged. Aren't you going to kiss me? There's just one thing I want more than anything else. And what's that? I want you and Pop to meet and know one another. I hope he'll like me. How could he help liking you? Bill, you're so sweet, so good, so handsome. Handsome? Why, I love your face. It's the cutest face I've ever seen. Cute? That's a fine thing to say to me. And you're such a baby. Look, the rain's stopped. Isn't that too bad? Yes. It's awful, but we'd better get started back. We've got to make that train. Yeah, I guess you're right. I hope you didn't catch the flu in this storm. Don't start worrying about me or I'll break our engagement. You have the prettiest hair. I'll bet no other nurse's aide has hair like that. Lots of them have. Prettier, too. - They don't have as pretty eyes. - Prettier. Noses, then. - Lots prettier. - I don't believe it. I'll tell you one thing they don't have. They don't have precious you to take them out to the country. Come on, let's go. Precious, cute... New York Central train number 2, the Pathfinder, leaving at 12:01 for Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, Albany, and New York on track number 4. Just let me look at you, darling. It's a picture I'll carry with me always. Now go, and don't even look back. Look at the nice apple Daddy got you. But I don't want you to go away. So it is late. Let me come up for ten minutes. I'm sorry, Mom. I've only got five minutes. My furlough was canceled. I swear, I can't tell any difference between it and butter. - Hello. My mommy's a sergeant. - No fooling! I won't forget. What's a good excuse for being AWOL? Agnes, look, on that dame... nylons. Now go, and don't even look back. Five months' pay... give me some War Bonds, and plenty of 'em. What, Bill? - Nothing. Just Jane. - Silly. It suits me if they tax me 100%. Oh, yeah? - I was just thinking. - So was I. I wonder if there's someplace free where we don't have to dance with hostesses. In 15 minutes you'll be gone. I know, I'll meet you in New York. You will? And we'll get married and I'll have a baby. Boy, that sounds wonderful. We'll get married and I'll have a baby. We'll do it... the day the war is over. No, I mean tomorrow. Or Tuesday. Gee, Jane, we couldn't do that. - Yes, we could, and we will. - You could and you will what? Now, don't tell me you two are having an argument. A fine thing, I must say... ten minutes before train time. It doesn't make any sense, Jane. What doesn't make any sense? All right, don't tell me, then. Jane, would you get Bill some magazines? - He doesn't need any. - I don't need magazines. Then some newspapers or cigarettes... anything. But, Mother, why? Because I want to talk to Bill. I'll be finished by the time you get back, I promise. I'm sorry to break in on these last minutes, Bill. I hope you're not worried over what we were talking about. - I told Jane... - You don't have to tell me. I wanted to talk to you about your grandfather. Oh, him. The colonel was very upset about your leaving. How did he know I was leaving? Did you tell him? Yes. I hope you don't mind. It doesn't make any difference. Not to him, it doesn't. Your grandfather loves you very deeply. Then why wasn't he here to see me off? I think he'll still make it. He said he was going to try, and I believe him. He said if he didn't, to wish you luck. He did? Isn't there something you want me to say to him? Well, maybe you could tell him that... tell him that I'm a Smollett, all right, and before this thing is over, I'll make him proud of me yet. Gee, that's a grandstand speech for you. No, it isn't. It's the very nicest gift you could give him. When you come back, we'll be waiting for you... the whole family. Thanks, Mrs. Hilton. I hope Jane doesn't bring me back any mystery magazines. I can't follow them. Here she is. Have you finished, Mother? I tried to get mystery magazines, but they're all sold out. - You see how lucky you are? - What do you mean? Never mind. Good-bye, Bill. Where are you going, Mother? I'll wait at the soda fountain. You two finish your argument. We weren't arguing. You were giving a good imitation of it. - So long. - Good-bye, Mrs. Hilton. I hope... I know everything's going to be all right about Mr. Hilton. Gate number 2 now open for the Pathfinder leaving at 12:01 a.m. You will marry me when it's over, won't you? You won't be mad because I didn't marry you now? Of course I won't be mad. - But you take care of yourself. - I will. - You write to me. - I will. - You do understand, don't you? - I think so. You know it's because I wouldn't want you to be... Well, you know, if anything happened to me... - A widow, you mean. - Yes, but not only that. If something happened... I mean, if I was... If you were wounded? Bill, I'd take care of you the rest of our lives, always. Gee, we're being silly. Maybe I'll be sent to Bermuda or someplace. - I don't think so. - Why, Jane? Because you're going to really show them. And you know where we'll go when we're married? Right up to West Point. And you'll show them your medals. All aboard! You better get on. I almost forgot, I have something for you. You have? You didn't have to do that. - Here. It's my class ring. - That's wonderful. You're sure you don't need it? I don't know what's more important than its being our engagement ring. Isn't it awful that I didn't get you a ring? But I'll send you one. It doesn't fit. I should have gotten you something else. No, I'd rather have this than anything. Better get on, son. We're about to pull out. Hurry up, son. Go ahead, Bill. I almost forgot. Here. Have your picture taken as soon as you get there and send me one. I will. And don't you go getting fatter. Don't worry, I won't. Jane, here! Hurry! It's your watch! You'll need it! Good-bye, darling. Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time. So long, darling. Bye. Take care of yourself. - Good-bye, Bill! - Good-bye, darling. Good-bye, darling! I love you! - I love you, darling! - Good-bye, darling. Good-bye, darling. Good-bye, darling. - Has the Pathfinder left yet? - Yes, sir, right on time. Hello, Brig! Hi, Jane. Wait for me. I'll be there in a minute. Now, Gladys, don't forget to go to the Jacksons' and pick up those big empty paint cans. I'll see you tomorrow. - How are things at the hospital? - Fine. - How's school? - Same old bore. Young girls should get an education. Is that so? I didn't notice you dashing off to college. I'll go to college eventually to please Mother. We couldn't afford it now anyway. Maybe Bill and I will go together after we're married. Fat chance. Mrs. William Smollett II, queen of the freshman hop. Look at Soda. He's got some new playmates. Hello, Soda. Jane, what have you heard from Bill? He's fine. I think he expects to see action any day now. Wouldn't it be fun to go there on your honeymoon and visit the places he's fought? I don't think so. I wanna get a little place all by ourselves, just as far away from all that as... What about a houseboat on the Nile? Or a cottage on the beach at Waikiki. You could go surf-riding. Jane, will you take me along? Brig, how can you be so infantile? All right, I'll be getting married myself someday, and you'll be looking for an invitation from me. Then you'll be sorry you were so snooty about it. Come on in, Soda, if you're coming. - Hello, girls. - Hello, Mother. Would you mind checking the oven? I've been making cookies. - Mother, do I have to? - Do as Mother asks, Brig. All right. Come into the living room. I'd like to talk to you. What's the matter? - Mayn't I talk to you if I want? - Of course. But you sound so strange. Do I? I'm sorry, I don't mean to. What is it? Why couldn't Brig hear? Is that why you sent her... - Not about... Pop? - No. Sit down, darling. Jane, dear, I'm terribly proud of the way you've grown up. I'm sorry Pop missed it. Is that all? That's sweet of you, Mother. No, dear, it isn't... It's so wonderful being at the hospital. I wish you could come and visit. I will. But some of it's so sad. If you could see those boys. And they're so cheerful, most of them. I know. They have such courage. I like to think that you have that kind of courage, too, darling. What are you trying to tell me? That when a man goes off to war, we have to be... It's Bill! The telegram came just a few minutes ago. It was addressed to you, but I opened it. Did it say he was missing or what? I don't care if he's wounded, if only... No, dear, it said he... It said he died in action at Salerno. It couldn't be! It couldn't be! It could be a mistake, couldn't it, Mother? I've heard that sometimes they get the names mixed up. No, honey, you mustn't fool yourself. That would be the worst thing of all. You've got to face it, as hard and cruel as it is. Yes, I know. I've known it all along. Cry, darling. Cry your heart out. I won't try to tell you that you'll get over it soon, because it will take time... maybe a long time. No, I won't cry. A wonderful boy loved you, Jane. That doesn't happen to everybody. But I had him only for such a little while. I'll go help with supper. There's chicken fricassee just the way you like it. Sounds fine. Isn't it funny? We were just talking. Brig was just saying about our... ...about our honeymoon. Oh, my baby. My poor, poor baby. He struggled so hard to be a soldier because I insisted on it. I, in my infinite wisdom. He would have been a soldier anyway as things turned out. Yes, but all he learned from me was the glory, decorations, parades. Bill had character and courage. I know you gave him those. I hope so. - He loved you. - Mrs. Hilton, I'm not a child. He hated me. To whom did that telegram come? Why, he didn't even list me as next of kin. The telegram came to Jane because they were to be married. - I didn't know, of course. - I should have told you before. Colonel, if only you could believe that he loved you. Don't you remember the message he sent to you... that he was a Smollett, all right, and before the war was over, you'd be proud of him? He did say that, didn't he? Yes, I am proud of him. My only grandchild had to die before l... Come in. Good evening, Colonel Smollett. Good evening, Jane. Come in, please. I thought perhaps I could bring you a little supper. Why, thank you. That's most thoughtful of you. I'm awfully sorry about... Would you like to have this? I think he'd rather you... - I'm awfully glad we're friends. - So am I. I'll get your supper now if you'll excuse me. Colonel, won't you have supper with us? I should love to. - I'll come right down, dear. - All right, Mother. And I might have had that wonderful child as a granddaughter. Bill was fortunate to have known her. Bill deserved her. He was such a good boy. Yes, I dare say. The good die first. And they whose hearts are dry as summer dust burn to the socket. Shall we stop a moment and rest in the shade, Mr. Williams? I can't imagine anything more pleasant than being out here. Or do you miss the water? I love to sail, so I can understand it if you do. I hate it. I never want to see the ocean again. Would it help you to talk about it? I hate the ocean. Of course you do. I understand. It's almost time for your lunch. Dr. Golden will be angry with me if you're late. He's taken a great interest in you. Me in the Merchant Marine? That was a joke in the first place. I've always hated the water, ever since I was a kid. But most boys love the water. They love to swim. I couldn't swim. Then one day my brother Jimmy pushed me off the pier. Then he had to pull me out. He was always laughing at me and telling me not to be yellow. He told me not to be yellow when our ship was hit. That was the last time I ever saw him. You're not a coward, Danny. Fear is normal. We'll help you to understand that. And when you do, you won't be afraid of the water. You won't even be afraid of being afraid. Rest a while, Danny. You're a fine boy. I'm sorry to have interrupted you, Dr. Golden, but I was instructed to get the patient to bed. It's all right. He's had quite enough for one day. Doctor, will Mr. Williams be all right? In time. In time. He's a fine young man. He must have another chance at life, and we must work to give it to him. His burns seem almost healed. Yes, his burns, but the most serious injury... that, I am afraid, will take more time. The injury to his mind? Is that what you mean? No, not to his mind. To his confidence in himself and in others. Yes, we must rebuild Danny Williams' life all the way back and all the way forward. Hasn't there ever been anyone close to you, Miss Hilton, for whom you would like to have done that? Yes, there was someone. There was. We must not live in the past, my child. There is a whole wide broken world to mend. Come, come, I mustn't have another patient. How would you like to do a tired old man a favor? - Anything, Doctor. - Then smile for me. Let me see that young people still can smile as they used to long ago. Yes. Just as I remember. Good night, my child. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Colonel Happy birthday to you Thank you, Mrs. Hilton. Thank you, Jane. Thank you, Brig. And thank you, Fidelia, for the beautiful cake. Better wait till you taste it. It's kind of an experimentation. Now you make a wish. And if you want it to come true, you have to blow out all the candles with one breath. Really? All of them? Yes, indeed. Don't you think we might allow the colonel two breaths? No special dispensations are necessary. Now you have to get the first piece. Really, Bridget, I wasn't born yesterday. There are a few things that I do know. Bridget, he's here again. Soda, get down. Come here. He never does that with anybody else. He's apparently very devoted to you. I have taken every conceivable step to discourage his affection. I wonder who that could be. Is you anticipating callers, Miz Hilton? I'll answer it, Fidelia. Don't you bother. You're busy. If it's Gladys, I'm not home. Yes, the bad penny again. - How are you, Janie? - I'm fine, Tony. Brig wrote me about... everything. Please, don't talk about it. I understand. - Who is it, Jane? - You'll never guess! It's the colonel's birthday. We're giving him a party. Maybe I'd better go. You'll do no such thing. You're just what we need. - Not Lieutenant Willett! - Lieutenant Commander to you. Not really? Congratulations. You didn't say you were coming back. I was going to write you, but I wasn't sure you cared. You're just in time for some birthday cake. - Good evening, Mr. Willett. - How are you, sir? So you've been promoted. I suppose there must have been some reason for it. I'm sure I don't know what it could have been. I was sorry to hear about Bill. Thank you. Sit down, Tony. That looks good. Where's Fidelia? - Here I is, Lieutenant Willett. - Fidelia. This makes it official. - Here, give me that. - Thank you. I sure is glad to see you back. Should I move the rooms around like before, Miz Hilton? Oh, my goodness! Don't worry, I've got a room downtown this time. Never heard tell such a thing. Now... I almost forgot, I have something for you, Jane. Didn't you bring me anything? It isn't anything, but I couldn't resist getting it for Jane. Where on earth did you get it? It was practically the only thing left of a little shop in Salerno. I'm sorry, Jane. I didn't know where... It's all right, Tony. Well, isn't anybody interested in this cake? By the way, Fidelia, just what was the experimentation you referred to in connection with this cake? I tried something new. I bought it. You clearly see there's nothing in the handkerchief. Nothing at all that meets the human eye. I'll show you both sides so you can be sure I'm not holding back anything. Correct, Brig? I suppose there's something there, but I'll play along. - How about you, sir? - There's nothing in that handkerchief. You don't need to labor the point further. Tiresome, isn't it? Watch. Presto, change-o. - Marvelous! - I'll get it. I think I'd like to learn that trick, Mr. Willett. It might amuse the dodos at the Army and Navy Club. I'd be honored, sir. Good evening, Brig. Is your mother at home? That sounds like your favorite woman. Mrs. Hawkins... that voice has haunted me across the Atlantic. Hello, Emily. I haven't seen you in ages. Good evening, Lieutenant Willett. I didn't know you were back. I've learned a new trick. The Navy thought I ought to bring it home for purposes of morale. I thought you already knew all the tricks, Lieutenant. Touch, as we used to say in Minneapolis. And this, I presume, is General Smollett. - I've heard so much about you. - I thought you'd met before. No, but I envy you, having such a distinguished man as your guest. It is I who should be envied. And it is Colonel Smollett, madam, and Lieutenant Commander Willett. I always get those things mixed up. It doesn't matter what a man's rank is. It's his character that counts. Hello, Jane. What's this I hear about you working at the hospital? - I'm a nurse's aide. - A nurse's aide? What a revolting idea for an unmarried girl of your age. Our whole code of living seems to be completely ignored these days, and possibly it's none of my business. You're quite right, Mrs. Hawkins. It is none of your business. I must say, Lieutenant or Commander or whatever you are, the Navy hasn't improved your manners any. Please, Tony. Please, Emily. It's the colonel's birthday, and we're trying to have a party. I'm sorry. I meant no offense to you, Jane. I simply feel that well-brought-up young girls shouldn't be permitted to have such intimate contact with all sorts of... All sorts of boys who've lost their arms and legs? They're young, too, lots of them. But they weren't too young for that, Mrs. Hawkins. And I don't think breeding entered into it, either. Bravo, Jane. I don't care to debate it with you, Jane. But surely there are women who are more suited... There aren't women more suited. And women who might help, like you, think you're doing your part if you attend a canteen dance for your own pleasure. You're tired, honey. Why don't you go upstairs? Yes, Mother. There are just one or two more things I want to say. She's not worth it. We're not V-Girls! We're simply helping with the wreckage. Brig, let's go play with our dolls. Don't worry, Mrs. Hawkins. Please don't worry if our precious well-bred hands come in contact with those mangled bodies. We'll survive! Even when they don't! What has happened that you would permit a child of yours to talk that way without so much as a... Without so much as what? Thank heaven my child had the courage to say to you what should have been said long ago. And let me add that I'm ashamed that I've put up with you, that I've even known you. Well! From now on, you needn't know me. Don't you think for a minute you have me fooled. I've not forgotten how you felt about your husband joining up. And may I ask just what other noble sacrifices you've made to give you the privilege of being so self-righteous? I'm afraid that's just it, Emily. I haven't really made any sacrifices. I haven't hoarded and cheated and done the selfish, unpatriotic things that you've done, but as far as making sacrifices, I'm afraid we're two of a kind. And the realization of it doesn't make me very proud or happy. Well! Good-bye, Major. I think we've seen the last of Mrs. H. For a while. When I think of the good men they waste on Kitchen Police. I wish getting Emily out of the house was a solution to something. It's a temporary solution to the problem of avoiding Emily Hawkins. How about a little nightcap for the three of us, Anne? I'll run up and see how Jane is, if you don't mind. You'll find some scotch on the sideboard. Please don't go, Tony. I want to talk to you. - Say when, Colonel. - That'll be fine. Happy birthday. Thanks. I almost forgot. - A pity, isn't it? - It sure is. Well, I think I'll take myself off to bed. Good night, Willett. I rather like you, if I may say so. Couldn't be more pleased, sir. - You'll ruin your big toe. - Wouldn't that be awful? I'd never be able to place-kick again for old Rutgers. You didn't expect to find another front here at home, did you? But our side won... victory over gas power. - How's Jane? - She's fine. Her thinking is as clear as a bell. How am I, why don't you ask? Trying to figure out what sacrifices you can make? Don't, Tony. After all you've been through, to have to listen to you berate yourself. You wouldn't sit down and let me talk for a minute, would you? All right. But I won't promise to listen. What's your guess as to why I joined the Navy? 'Cause you want to do your part, just the way Tim did. Don't kid yourself. I'm no Tim. I joined up because Top Hat suddenly seemed a little silly and I wanted to have some fun and excitement. I laughed up my sleeve at all the fellows who were giving out with noble motives, the Four Freedoms, and all the rest of it, but I found out that it all added up to a simple corny phrase that I couldn't laugh off... "Home sweet home." - I know. - You do know? You're doing a swell job here at home holding things together. Those daughters of yours, they're pretty wonderful. I know Tim's going to be mighty pleased with them. I imagine he'll be a bit surprised to see how Jane grew up without so much as a by-your-leave. Yes, she grew up while Mother knitted. Or worse still, while Mother didn't even knit. That's the point, Tony. Can't you see it? Boy, I see what you mean now about not listening. - I guess I was pretty dull. - All right, laugh at me. But it's settled in my mind once and for all. I have a husband who went off to fight for this home and for me... that's what you said. And I have children who had courage and intelligence while their mother lived in a dream world. I've come out of it. I buy your "Home sweet home" idea, but I want to do something about it. Well, say something. Don't tell me that glib Tony Willett's at a loss for words. Well, Annie, my girl, I'm afraid you're right. I hope you'll think I was right, too, Tim, and that someday you'll be interested in reading this diary. And I hope you won't be too shocked when you hear that I'm actually training for work in a shipyard. Yes, tremendous changes have taken place in the pampered woman who was your wife. It's hard even for me to realize I'm studying to be a lady welder. And doing very nicely, so it seems. Oh, Tim, I love it so, and I have such admiration for all these people. There's one woman I can't wait for you to meet. Her name is nothing like we ever heard at the country club. It's Zofia Koslowska, and she likes me because she thinks I helped her through a most awful and tragic Ioneliness. I wish my little boy had lived so he could have seen America. I used to read to him about it every night when the shades were drawn and the sound of heavy boots marching down the street made my poor little Janka shake until I thought his bones would crack. And then we'd pray together that God would let us go to the fairyland across the sea. If only he could have been with me the day I went all by myself to the Statue of Liberty and read what it says there for the whole world to see. Do you know it? Anne Hilton, did you ever read it? No. I'm sorry to say, I don't know it. I'll never forget it. I know it so well here because I feel it so much here. It says... "Give me your tired, your poor, "your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, "the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. "Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door." You've helped light that lamp for me, Anne Hilton. And then, Tim, she said the most thrilling thing that has ever been said to me. She said... You are what I thought America was... what I meant when I prayed with little Janka. And as in my own small way I help here in the shipyards, I hope I may be worthy of her words, just as each night I pray that always I may be worthy of those other thrilling words... ... the first time and every time since that you've said, "I love you." Now remember, don't start until the door opens. And when it does, let 'em have it. What's the matter? You look reluctant. It ain't that I don't trust you, but I'd like to have my money first. You've got a very suspicious nature. All set? Lieutenant Solomon, clear for action. Aye-aye, sir. Jane, Colonel, come on. Somebody's here. They're singing! - I'll be down in a minute. - Come on, Colonel! "Silent night, peace on earth, goodwill toward men." I didn't want to wrap this in a box with fancy ribbon, but I knew you'd like to have it. Thank you, Janie. Merry Christmas. - Who's next on your team? - Colonel Smollett. Get going, Colonel. You're our anchorman. We've given you a nice easy one. Please don't be patronizing. I can act it. - All right, go. - We've only got a minute and a half. You might wait until I've read it. - Have you read it? Time. - Let's go, Colonel. Anchors aweigh. - That is not it. - Please, Colonel. - Two words. - It didn't say to talk. What difference does it make if I say "two" or hold up two fingers? Come on, Colonel, it's a half a minute already. Is it an animal? Come on, Danny Williams, give him a question. Is it a quotation? Army mule. They're being very stupid, Colonel. You're giving a wonderful performance. Do something else. Rolling stone. No talking, Colonel. Colonel, don't get sore. Just try doing what you did before. If we don't guess it, we'll give up. Anybody could guess that. You can't guess, Fidelia. No fair. We can afford to be generous. Let them have Fidelia. - Bottoms up. - Thank goodness! - Was that it? - Certainly that was it. I'm glad you weren't on their team the whole time, Fidelia. - How'd you guess it, Fidelia? - It weren't nothin'. I'm just naturally... psychopathic. Come on, don't be nervous. Come on. Mother, Gladys wants to say something. Well, hallelujah! Bring her in! This is Gladys Brown, everybody. She's a friend of mine. - Come in, Gladys. - She wants to say something. Come on, Gladys, it isn't hard. Honest. Merry Christmas. Well, she made it anyway. I have big plans for her next year. Yes, she could be the class orator. Come on, everybody, coffee and sandwiches. Congratulations, sir. I thought you acted very good. It was nothing really. Gee, that was fun. The colonel's a good sport. Yes, we all adore him. Fidelia, when did you start specializing in this bird food? You won't tell anybody? There's a chicken leg I saved for you. - That's more like it. - Sneak out by yourself. You'll find it on the second shelf in the icebox. It's a wonderful party. It's Tony. He brings life to any party. Tony's doomed to go through life as everybody's darling. Even to his men? Well, they don't think of him as darling, exactly. Hero worship's more like it. I'll bet he didn't tell you he's been recommended for the Navy Cross. No, really? He'll make jokes about it, but he's very proud of it. I want to talk to you, John Paul Jones. What have I done now? The Navy Cross... that's what you've done. Yes, he told me. Do they give you a ribbon? What does it look like? What are the colors? - It looks just like that. - Stop it, Tony. This is an old one. It's last year's model. He'll joke about it, but he's really very proud of it. Well, he said the same thing about you. - If you people will excuse me now. - He did, did he? Never mind about him. I want to talk to you. I wish Solomon would stop acting as my press agent. - What do I do with this? - What do you suppose? - Finish it, you wastrel. - I could use milk with it. Honestly. I never knew heroes were so helpless. Here, look out. Tony, I'm really very angry with you. I have to find things out from a stranger. Didn't think you'd be interested. Of course not. No, all I want to know is if you found any new sugars in Sicily. I don't want to shock you, but it's no wonder those Italians can paint. There was a dame standing in the middle of the street with a big tub of spaghetti, and she had... she had... Never mind what she had. I have a little imagination. Yeah. Well, even as I looked at her, I thought, "She's good, but what are all the women in the world compared with Anne?" Tony, will you never stop? I'll never stop, Anne, as long as I can dream about you. If you ever thought that dream had a chance of coming true, you'd... I'd what, Anne? Finish it yourself. You make it pretty tough for me. I'd feel I'd been wrong about you all my life. I'd have to go looking for a new ideal. It's a little late for that. What's more, you'd run for your life. But first you'd wring my neck as I'd expect you to. That's right, and what would be the fun in that? I'd never be able to break my heart over you anymore. Tony, never grow up. Never, never. Or I'd lose something very dear to me. Something very dear to all of us. All right, but I'm going to sound awful silly someday making verbal passes at you when we're both in wheelchairs. I'm looking forward to that. Now wipe the milk off your silly face and tell me in your usual accurate fashion how you became a hero. Well, I'll tell you. I suddenly thought it was kind of damp on deck. I looked down and seemed to be standing in a swimming pool... - Well, good-bye, Jane. - Good-bye? I've signed on again and I'll be shipping any day now. - You must be glad. - Yes, I am. Jane, you've been wonderful to me. May I write to you? I wish you would. Okay! You started it! Merry Christmas! I still contend that if there had been one lone, single, solitary grain of intelligence on our entire team... - Colonel, stop right where you are. - What's the matter? And stop blushing. It's an old custom. As I recall the custom, Mrs. Hilton, the ceremony isn't complete until everyone has participated. Thank you, Anne. I haven't had an experience like this in 45 years. Well, Merry Christmas to you all. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Colonel. Come on, Soda. Coming up, Mother? Not for a little while. I have a few things to do. Good night. - Good night, darling. - Good night, Mother. - Merry Christmas, Mother. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, darlings. What are those, Fidelia? Mr. Hilton done sent these to me a long time ago and told me to put them under the Christmas tree just like we've always done. Now, now, no tears, Fidelia. There's nothing to cry about. I can't help it. He sent me something, too. Mr. Hilton never forgot me, even when he was fighting them devils. He'll be so happy to hear that you're back on the old job again. Yes, ma'am. Miz Hilton, can I confide something? Yes, Fidelia. Brig sent her daddy his gift just like nothing happened. Of course she did. So did Jane. So did I. You all did that? Miz Hilton, I guess I just ain't on the right side of the Lord. I just ain't had the right kind of faith. But I will have. From now on, I'll be a true believer. And now I'm wishing you a good night, Miz Hilton. Good night, Fidelia. Hello? Cable gram? Yes, read it, please. What was that? No. Yes, yes. Yes, mail it to me, please. Yes, ma'am. It's a cable! Pop's safe! Pop's safe! I just got word he's coming home! He's coming home!
