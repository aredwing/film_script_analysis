Hey, what did I do? Hey! Please don't! Please stop! neck chop!!!!! there was expectation in his reaction eww... i threw up a bit... This is horrible. This video is pretty awesome, isn't it? Death Tube. They gotta be kidding. But it's well made for fake stuff. It's real. Huh? Real video. No way. If it was real, the cops would've exposed them. Exposing them is impossible. Oh? Why is that? It's an extremely obscure site. Extremely obscure site? Yes. It's only online a couple of times a year, and for one week only. An extremely obscure site. But someone would surely report it. Even so, they run through a number of overseas servers. So exposing them is difficult. If it's fake, would they really go that far? What? Do you really believe this? It's all based on rumor. There's also talk that it's some film buff shooting with real actors. Oh. Check out the videos if you have the time. No, I'm not interested in these things. Why not? Did you get the photos? You're still on the phone. Mr. Tamai, thank you for the photos. Yes, yes. Well, good-bye. Okay. I have printed the photos. - Really? - Yeah. Let me see. Here. Wow! This is so good.

Thank God! tears of joy are beautiful Thank God. Hello. My name is Ponkichi. My best regards. You... brought me here? Yes, that's right. Who are you? I'm Ponkichi. The manager of the Death Tube rooms. Why are you doing this? I just want you to have fun here. Stop joking! You think killing people passes for fun? Hey... Let me out of here! Hurry up and get me out of here! You're wasting your time. You've seen Death Tube, right? Haven't you? i'm not dreaming A little bit... I've seen it many times before so I know for a fact... ...that it's impossible to get out of here. That can't be true. I won't accept that! However... ...there is a way out of here. You clear the game. We just cleared it. Not just one. The games will keep coming. Huh? Then how many do I have to clear? That... ...I don't know. How come you don't know? How many were cleared by the people who got out? There aren't any... Huh? ...who have gotten out. What? Everybody dies in the end... ...by failing to clear the game. What? Then what should I do? Why? Why were we brought here in the first place? How would I know? I went to sleep at night and suddenly I'm here. Me too. I dozed off watching Death Tube. Me too. While watching. Me too. So the reason we were brought here... ...is because we watched Death Tube? Oh, that might be why. No, that's not why. More than a thousand people watch Death Tube. There must be another reason why we were brought here. Another... For example, we may be connected by our past somehow. But I've never seen any of you before. And there's a difference in our ages. If we're not connected in any way, maybe we have something in common. Something in common... It's starting again. So we have to play the game? We do... ...or we'll end up like the last guy. Before we start the game... ...I like for all of you to take a look at the completed sentence on the Rubik's cube. What is written on the cube... ...must be completely adhered to until you leave this room. It's a must! What, "Challenge"? If you can't adhere to it... ...you will die. First off, pull away the sheet behind you. Seven challenges have been prepared for this game. "The bat" Inside the circle put your forehead against the end of the bat... ...run around it ten times and if you can touch me within ten seconds... ...you're clear. Oh. My shoes. "The stopwatch" Close your eyes... ...let it count for ten seconds... ...and stop it. Plus or minus one second off the mark and you are clear. "The hula hoop" I'm tired so I'm going to speak faster. Huh? "Headband" - Input the the Constitution preamble into the PC and you're clear. "Dumbbell" - One hundred lifts and you're clear. "Jump rope" - Do it and you're clear. "Nail" - Jam it under your nail and you're clear. Did you understand... ...these seven challenges? One person has to do one challenge each, within an hour. Of course, if you fail a challenge... ...at the end of the game you will die. However, even if you fail a challenge... ...there is a possibility to survive. If all of you clear a total of four challenges... ...there will be no need for anyone to die. What does it mean? Basicallly, the assignment consists of four. If the assignment is failed... ...only the person who failed the challenge is killed. Conversely... ...even if the assignment is failed, those who met the challenge won't be killed. Exactly right. So, doing the easy challenges first... ...is advantageous. Which to do is a matter of first come first serve. THE FOURTH CHALLENGE Well, then... ...to your positions. Ready... Go! Don't! Don't think only about yourself. mustache Hey, what are you doing? - the rule is you have to do what the cube says - this guy's camera conscious lol Everybody... ...think carefully. What's important in this game... ...is not uyou/u clearing the challenge. It's to complete the assignment and save ueverybody/u. Listening to the explanation... in my opinion, there are four easy challenges. Hula hoop... Bat... Stopwatch... Nail. To complete the assignment, we have to clear these four challenges at least. - i want them to fail all of them lol - you look serious lol Because, no matter how you look at it, clearing the other three is impossible. To that extent... ...selfishly taking on a challenge... ...and failing is shameful! - he's approaching again - i'm inconvenienced too Let's combine our strengths and complete the assignment. I... ...agree. I also agree. Not me, no way. I absolutely will not die! I also agree, but one thing... Are you listening? Why is the nail included as an easy challenge? No matter how much thought I give the nail... No. The nail is an easy challenge with little risk. Huh? Because no one will fail. If you bear the pain... ...no doubt you will clear it. The question is... ...whether somebody will do it. Um... ...I... ...just can't handle pain. Of course. We can't have a woman experience pain. Hey, I'm a woman too. I'm sorry. Who then? I will. I will do it. Slurp slurp. I cannot afford to die. So... ...leave the nail... ...up to me. Slurp slurp. Is that alright? Yes. But please give me a little time. In order to do it, I need to build up my courage. Slurp slurp. Thank you! he stood up! lol he rises to the occasion From this point... ...people with confidence step forward. Then I will choose first. After all... ...I asked for everyone's cooperation. So which will it be? I used to skate in school. I'm confident about rotations. After ten turns... ...touch me within ten seconds. Get ready for the bat spin... Go! - he can't - he's fast lol whoa, he won't make it? Ten... Nine... - Do it! - Eight... - Please hurry - Seven... Do it. Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One... Zero! TIME LEFT: 00'33'' He did it! Awesome! You did it! he moved so funny he has an octopus face lol You did good. Congratulations! Can I do the hula hoop next? Can you do it? I often do it with my kid so I think I can do it. As I stated earlier, we absolutely cannot fail the easy challenges. However... if you say you're confident. Yes, sort of. And no one else has stepped forward. Give your best, man. Yeah. Give it your best. what's your type of guy? lol What? pervert! you're dirty so execute! Where are your pants? The cube. Gyrate for one minute without dropping it. To your position. Ready. Go! do your best old man i can't watch this with a straight face!!!! Go, go. Do your best. Yes. He'll make it. - old man's legs - what is this? i can't stop laughing - hula hoop is easy - why do women get like this? pervert! you're looking too closely! simply good!! may your crotch ride on radio waves lol whoa!! good job, old man!! Clear! - Yeah, he did it! - Good, good! Good. The old man is awesome! I did it! I did it! - I did it! - I'm so glad! Awesome, old man. hurry with the nail I will go next. go virgin! lol suffering four-eyes The time left... ...is twenty-two minutes. Oh, slurp slurp! dancing loser blood blood!!! I'm alright. Hurry up and complete the next challenge. One more left. If we can clear one more... The stopwatch is last. THE FOURTH CHALLENGE I will do it. Are you confident? I don't know. Don't know? You have no confidence you can do it, yet you're going to do it? You absolutely cannot fail this challenge. A person with no confidence... THE FOURTH CHALLENGE - I'm sorry. shut up with the speech THE FOURTH CHALLENGE - I have to do it. Recently though... ...I successfully played the same game at a company party. Give it your best. I'm praying for your success. Close your eyes and stop it on ten seconds. Be within one second and you clear it. One, two, three... ...four, five, six, seven, eight... Please. ...nine, ten. If he clears it... ...we're saved. - what? - oh no - i'm speechless - i knew it Oh, my... That's too bad. If the assignment isn't completed... ...you will have to die. What do we do now? From this point on the remaining three... ...have to clear a challenge. Hey, don't be so nonchalant. You yourself said the remaining challenges are impossible. That's right. Just because you guys cleared it. You're horrible. We will... ...be killed. It's alright. Leave the "Headband" one... ...up to me. Really? You can do it? Please. Please! Within one minute... ...use the PC to input... ...the preamble to the Japanese Constitution. Well then... ...to your position. Ready. Go! You have it in you. - You can do it. - You're doing fine. - Stay calm. You can do it. - You'll get through it. Anything. Type anything! Stay calm. That's right. Stay calm. You can do it. Please! Please! Do your best! you can praise him, but he's out lol Do your best. Stay calm. You can do this. it looks like it's game over resurrection? Good, that's it. - Good, good. - That's it. - You're doing fine. - Good, good, good. That's it. Just a little more. - A bit more. - You got it. - Hang in there. -You're gonna be okay. seriously awesome! Huh? Awesome! - You did it! - Awesome! Well done! this is shit boring You did great. Thank you. I was afraid of a mistake, but you're remarkable. I get it! - We did it! We did it! - What do you mean? Everyone... We're saved! Huh? Look at what's posted. TODAY'S OBJECTIVES: INCREASE LOYALTY AND COOPERATIVENESS These objectives... reveal the true nature of the games we played today. In the first game, as is written on this paper... ...as is written on this paper... ...we're spared if we're uloyal/u to the letter. TODAY'S OBJECTIVES: INCREASE LOYALTY AND COOPERATIVENESS I see. uIn the second game we're spared if we cooperate./u we'll still see you if you step back a bit The rest is... You know what I want to say. There are only two goals today. yes yes So what about the games? Yes! The games are over! We have survived! We survived. We survived! We did it! We did it! We did it! We did it. We survived. Thank you so much. - Thank you. Really thanks. - Thank you Thank you. Not at all. It's no big deal. You saved me. - Thank you. - Awesome. - You were calm for a young guy. - Really, thanks for saving us. - Wonderful. I'm so glad. - It's nothing. - you're crazy - don't be smiling You're just talking. Thank you. Awesome. Great. You're great. I knew it. you're just talking That's enough old lady. Shut up. - Awesome. - Huh? Behind you... I knew you could do it. Huh? What? - Wait a... - Old lady, you're just talking. - god - you did your best lol - It's nothing. - whoa! for real? rubik's cube No, no! I can't take it! I can't take it anymore! No, no! No more! I don't get it! I can't take it anymore! No! No more, no more! I can't take it! No! Stop it! No! Knock it off! What do you think a person's life's worth? It's absolutely worthless. Huh? It's worthless. And that is the same... it's worth to you people. Cut the crap! We don't kill people! Don't compare us to you! Let's calm down. The important thing now... ...is to get out of here fast. not tonight old lady, you should die lol you should die since you came all the way - the video! - ahhh! everybody's so stupid i'm glad they can leave don't forget your shoes pervert lol boring don't run away!! What? What is this place? Is your finger alright? Yes. It's alright. Slurp slurp. Hello. What's going on? DEATH TUBE It won't open. What's going on? I've watched Death Tube numerous times... ...but this development is a first. Wait! Hey stop it! Don't pick on him! Ouch! Stop it! What? Hey! What are you doing? Look at that! DON'T CROSS THE RED LINE Even out here... ...we have to obey that bear. Slurp slurp. What? What's going on? What's next? What's happening? Game Number Three! DEATH TUBE - now the real show starts lol - too bad, it's not over yet! lol All of you will now do the obstacle race. Obstacle race? Unfortunately it's hard to explain in words. So I'll act it out! Damn you! Are you alright? Who are you? Let us out of here! Come within a five meter radius of me... ...and I start shooting. Now then, back to my explanation. I'm going to start. Start from this red line. Then you hop, hop, stop. You hop, hop, stop. Then after you eat a donut... ...go to the slippery swamp... ...and whisk across it. Whoa, cold. Next... ...stack five toy blocks... ...and take them to the desk over there without dropping them. Then... ...finally, drink the glass of water and you've reached the goal. But, there are only five glasses. That's correct. The one that finishes last out of the six of you... ...can't drink the water... ...and has to die. And also... ...if you can't reach the goal within three minutes of starting... ...you have to die. TODAY'S OBJECTIVE: INCREASE THE SPIRIT OF EQUALITY The race will start... ...as soon as somebody... ...crosses the red line. Girls are at a disadvantage in this race! Right? Everyone listen up. Don't start. What do you mean? I'll explain later. Just don't start. To your positions. You're planning to start first. - Ready. - No! We must not compete in this game! Go! - the bear is groovin' - these people are desperate lol Damn you! - Hey. - Not fair. Thank you. the guy in the glasses is gross if she dies, i won't watch hop hop smitten, smitten, smitten Hurry! If you're last you die. Hurry! Why did you do that? I'm sorry. The race has been decided! Huh? CONGRATULATIONS! I have an announcement. Actually... ...that donut was... ...poisoned! But not to worry. The water you drank is the antidote. That means... No! No! the hag eats it lol gross she isn't that good What are you saying... ...we did this? When will this end... ...this game? Once you clear the final game. The final game? If we play that... ...we can get out of here? Yes. When is this final game? Let's see... I don't know. What do you mean by, "I don't know"? Because the final game... ...is for one participant only! So, until there is only one person left... ...we keep playing games! Survival! Survival! Or, you could kill each other. after all, it's a survival of the fittest world it's kill or be killed lol murderer murderer murderer murderer let's survive This isn't a survival game at all! he's annoying lol Depending on how we cooperate... ...this is a game where nobody dies. Nobody dies? Three have already died! As I said earlier... ...just as with the games played in the previous room... ...in both cases, had we gained insight into the nature of the games... ...they would've been cleared without anybody having to die. But the last game was a race. uThe rules stated that someone had to die./u You're wrong. Look at today's objective... TODAY'S OBJECTIVE: INCREASE THE SPIRIT OF EQUALITY Equality? I think, equality most likely refers to not assigning rank. Equality? It's a race. Yes. If we compete, it creates rank. So... ...we shouldn't have competed. The bear explained in the rules... ...that the competition starts when that red line is crossed. I see. If no one started, there would have been no competition... Then nobody came in last place... ...we'd all survive, right? That's why you said don't start. I'm sorry. If there had been more time, I could've propely explained. Most likely... ...the games that are about to be conducted can be cleared without anybody dying. However... ...if one person attempts to become the sole surviver... ...and acts on their own behalf... ...someone's death will be the result. From now on... ...we refrain from selfish acts. Let's cooperate and continue clearing it. But you know... ...the final game is... ...for one participant only. Then no matter how long it takes... ...we can't escape! I don't think that's true. Maybe... ...a search may have started on the outside since we are missing. If we continue to clear the games, help will eventually come. I think we should have faith and be patient. Look at how many people watch Death Tube. That's true. There are so many viewers. Somebody will report it to the police. Right? There's a high probability of that. - Yeah. - I see. I don't know about that. Huh? Amongst us... ...who while watching thought of reporting it even for an instant? That's about it. But things would be different if the viewer knows you. Hello? Hello, Tomoe-chan? It's terrible... Mr. Tamai? What's wrong? Is Inouye there? Inouye? Where did he go? Then it's true. What do you mean? Right now Inouye... ...is on Death Tube! Death Tube? Sexy pose? Yes. - please - show your tits!!! Like this? No, that's not it. What? More sultry. Sultry? Sultry. - Like this. - Oh yeah, that's good. Is that good? - Also face down and look up. - Yes. Down and up. Help me. Help me. Do it with emotion. It's not working. What? I think we're on the right track. I agree. - It's no good at all. - What's wrong? Help me. It's not sexy enough. How's the wound? Eh, I can take it. Help me, big boy. Oh, this is hard. I guess that's about it. "About it"? I intend to do anything to get out alive. I'm going to have a child soon. At last, a child after ten years of marriage. That's why... Actually, I'm getting married soon. Is that right? She's the first girlfriend I've ever had. So I'm the same. - No good. Getting worse. - Huh? Let's give it our best and somehow escape this place. Yes. A little more... I've had it with these people! What do they take me for? Take something off. That's easy for you to say. It's sexual harassment. Please stop it. It's not sexual harassment. You're horrible. Can I say something? Who could be staging these games? Earlier, we talked about having something in common. Maybe that person is what we have in common. Can you think of anybody? Someone in common? I can't think of anyone. Here's more food for thought... What if all the people gathered here have committed a sin in the past... ...and this is the victims' place of revenge. No way. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Finding something in common... ...isn't going to get us out of here. For now, above all, let's wait for the police. Game Number Four! This time we'll play the word-chain game using the names of foreign places. please give us no-holds-barred brutality A balloon will start to inflate at the start of the word-chain game. Every time you give an answer, pass it to the next person. Five rounds of the word-chain game... ...before the balloon bursts means success. If it bursts... ...the person holding the balloon at that time will have to die. Also, it is forbidden to give each other the answer during the game. The game will start in ten minutes. Thinking time starts now! yay lol TODAY'S OBJECTIVE: INCREASE YOUR KNOWLEDGE What should we do this time? Somebody give me pen and paper. I have some. code blue the leader guy is on the move lol A pen. i don't care blow him off The rumors were true... Wait, Mr. Tamai. Inouye will be killed. What can we do, Mr. Tamai? Mr. Tamai. Hello? what are they doing? Inouye. i seriously want him dead Police, police. How much time has gone by? Approximately thirty seconds left. There's no time left. Just remember your part. - What? - Huh? Oh no. I'm not good at retention. Lima, Atlanta, San Francisco... Crime or accident? Hello! Would you like a bath? What? Would you prefer a meal? Or did you... ...prefer a bed? A wife needs... ...a bed... ...after all. Ding dong! four-eyes protect the princess!!! - she's in trouble lol - she has bad memory Don't panic. Let's stay calm while answering. We're alright. We will succeed. To your positions. Ready. Go! Athens. Nevada. Dakar. Ca... Ca... I forgot! Ca... Cairo! Cairo. Rome. Macao. O... O... O... O... O... O... Onega. Guthrie. What, what? Li... Li... Li... What was it? You can remember. I can't... ...remember! Li... Li... Lima! Lima! - Miami! Miami! - MiIan! No... No... No... No... No... No... No... No... Nottingham! Murcia! Atlanta! Tulsa! San Jose. Serbia! Alaska! Ca... Ca... I don't know! - Remember! - Stay calm and answer! Really. I don't know. I don't know. Canne! Nu... Nu... Nu... Nu... Numazu. Wrong! What? Where? Nu... Wait. Everybody wait! Everybody wait! - good-bye four-eyes - he said numazu lol I'm... ...going to have a child soon. At last, a child after ten years of marriage. That's why... No! Mr. Gondo! Don't! It's too late. He told me, he's going to have a baby. It's my fault. Game Number Five! No more! Four people left. It's reducing at a nice pace. I can't wait to see how many of you go this time. This one is a simple yes or no question game. If the respondent's answer... ...is correct, then the game is cleared. But if it's wrong... ...everyone will die! What? But don't worry. The question is... ...an extremely easy one that anybody can answer. Let's draw to see who will be the respondent! Well then, drum roll please! INOUYE - Congratulations! It has been decided that the respondent... ...is Inouye. For Inouye there is a present. Inouye-kun, before we start the question... ...I'd like you to see this first. Tomoe-chan... Tomoe-chan... Tomoe-chan! Tomoe-chan! Tomoe-chan! Hey... What did you do? What did you do to her?! Rape. Cut the crap! Wait! I'm gonna kill you! Calm down! You want to die? Here comes the question. Can you accept your girlfriend, who was raped... ...and love her the same way you have before? I need you to answer yes or no. Respond within... ...three minutes. Think about it until then. Thinking time... ...starts now! There is no answer to this! There's no question! In this instance... ...aren't his honest feelings the correct answer? Over there... TODAY'S OBJECTIVE: INCREASE HONESTY Honest feelings? Let me ask you beforehand. What do you intend to answer? Of course it's yes! Is that true? Does that answer reflect how you truly feel? What do you mean? An answer to keep up appearances won't do. That's a horrible thing to say! I believe there are people you can truthfully love. This is not the time for niceties All of our lives are at stake here. If I were in your place... ...I would answer no. There's no way you can love them the same as before. I think so too. Why is that? How come? Then let me ask you. From here on... ...how do you intend to connect with her? I'll love her even more. I'll be kinder to her than before. And how do you expect... ...that behavior... ...will make her feel? Painful perhaps. She will surely come to realize... ...that your kindness... ...is not kindness towards her, but for yourself. That your kindness... ...is a way for you to convince yourself... ...that you still love her. I'll ask you one last time. What's your answer? It is yes. Understood. I believe that's the way you truly feel. Three minutes have passed. I will ask the question.... ...one more time. Can you accept your girlfriend, who was raped... ...and love her the same way you have before? If you answer incorrectly, everybody dies. And the answer is... Yes? No? Which is it? No. Correct! This time no one had to die! For you, who answered correctly, we've prepared a special video. No! Help... ...me! No! No! No! Stop it! congratulations the marriage is canceled - today's mvp is born!! - this couple is over lol awesome, he said it lol - 40% of civilization is women - don't get depressed - who's happy here? will they die? - can't love damaged goods!! Game Number Six! Let's get motivated and keep on moving! That is a ballot. Other than yourself, name just one person... ...you don't want to die, and write down their name. After thirty minutes... ...the ballots will be collected. At that point... ...those who didn't receive a single vote... ...will die. It's a bonus game that kills the people you don't like. For the final game there can be only one participant. So... ...we eliminate as many people as we can in this game. Pay no attention to the bear's ways. We only need to think about clearing the game. But what about this game? It's easy. We group into pairs and vote each other's names only. I will write down Inouye's name... ...Inouye writes down mine. You two do the same. This way no one will die. this game is boring nobody dies i'm going to the bathroom even i know how to clear this lol If you do as I say... ...you'll surely get home alive. Please. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you for your patronage. What? Aren't you hungry? Don't hold back. You can eat. I'm sure you poisoned it again. There's none inside. You're lying! It's no lie. I don't like telling lies. Hey. Don't. Are you alright? It tastes pretty good. I hadn't eaten anything in a while and I was hungry. What do we do? Well, I'm certainly hungry. So am I. Does that say, "trust"? Yeah. Would you like one? No. Of course you won't eat. I'm sorry. Do you trust it? I'm having a smoke. Me first then? I think that last question was flawed. Because there's no right way to answer to a person's feelings. Making you answer "no", is the bears' objective of creating problems for the respondent. Honest feelings probably had nothing to do with it. I'm sure Tomoe-san understands that as well. So hurry and get out of here, and see Tomoe-san one more time... ...and let your true feeling... Hey. What's wrong? Are you alright? It was laced with poison after all. Shit! bring her back!!!! lol - dead - you guys have differing reactions What happens to her vote? If it's deemed invalid... ...I want to vote again. Yes. I will not have a single vote. Of course, her vote is accepted. Understood. I'll hold on to this. SAEKI That's good. Inouye-kun. There's no time left. I know how you feel... ...but we can't take our time. Please. Just write down my name and we're good. Don't you want to survive as well? We have to work together in this. Inouye-kun! I'm asking, please. You too want to live and go home. Either we all work together or it won't work. Mr. Maekawa, you've said enough. If it's alright, I'll talk to him instead. Please. It's been continually tough. I understand why you've clammed up. But we'll surely escape from this place. Let's do our best. Don't look at Maekawa. Stay calm and listen to me. Have you seen him anywhere before? What? At last I remembered. Look at this. - didn't he kill about ten people? - enter serial murderer All these comments are about him. About ten years ago, I was a news reporter and attended his trial. He was declared innocent by reason of insanity after psycho-analysis. There's no mistake. He's trying to be the sole survivor. And he's trying to get us killed. Remember... ...in Game Number Two... ...he said this and that and chose the easiest game for himself. Then I will choose first. In Game Number Three, that was certainly on purpose. Why did you do that? In Game Number Four... ...when you think about it, the lead person has the advantage. He decided the order on his own and took the lead position. And the last game... Either answer would have been right. Because no one said there is only one correct answer. He's smart, so of course he knows that. But he wanted certainty with the correct answer so he sought honesty from you. The point is that what he's doing is all the hypocrisy of just saving himself. I've seen it. He has a knife in his pocket. Up until now... there were too many of us, so he probably held back. But now that only we few are left... ...we don't know when his fangs will strike. He's a deviant. He's probably itching to kill someone. Then what? That's where I need a favor. What? On this ballot... ...do not write down his name. If I do that... He will die. But it's the only way. Listen, it's kill or be killed. Otherwise we'll be the ones killed. It's time for your votes. Put your ballots in front of Pontaro. I'm pleading... - it's getting interesting lol - a psycho serial killer? kills for pleasure enter the real hannibal which one is the murderer? - unbelievable psychopathic participation - whip it lol why the whip? It appears we have the results of the vote. The result of the vote... ...is this! Thanks. It's your own fault. It's your own fault! That was fun. Mr. Saeki? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh yes, I'll show you something interesting. Look. - he is the criminal lol - regrettable mistaken identity lol - that old man is the psychopath!! - serial killer Saeki!! That's right, the serial killer who feigned insanity and was found innocent... ...is me. It was a lie. Oh my... You killed such a good person. Look... His dead face is really quite striking. I'm rather satisfied. Because you people... ...made it so enjoyable. Hey, hold it! Frightened faces are beautiful. They excite me! Show me more. Death Tube is awesome. People simply keep on dying. I can kill with no reprimand. For me Death Tube is... ...paradise! How could you? I've been waiting for this moment all along... ...by pretending to be dead. Because... ...if I didn't, I wouldn't survive. At the time I thought... ''I can't trust any of these people'' Only one person can challenge the final game. I was sure someone would kill me. So... I figured I'd have to kill... ...before someone kills me. Athens, Nevada, Dakar... ...Cairo, Rome... ...Macao. Nothing wrong with my memory. You mean... That was on purpose. Because he was dangerous. He'd do anything to live. And he had a knife. Calm down. From here on... ...let's work together. Never. Ouch! It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. Hey, let go. It hurts. Let go. Let go. Let go! No. You got the wrong idea... I wasn't really thinking of killing you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? You got the wrong idea. You got the wrong idea. You got the wrong idea. Can you forgive me? Don't come near me. Why? No, no, no. Don't come near me! Stay away! No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Forgive me! No! No! No! Final Game! Congratulations. As the only survivor, you have won the right to challenge the final game. That better be true. What's that? If I clear the game, you will let me out of here? Of course. I don't like telling lies. This time, what you have to do is... ...play a lottery. A lottery? The last contestent gets... ...one draw. Within ten minutes, draw one stick. Win, and you will be set free. If you lose on the other hand, you must die. End of explanations. Well then... Ready. Start! I can't do it. Show some courage. Try drawing. It's all a lie... There's no way I can win! What can you do? You've really made an effort up to this point. So as a reward, I will give you a hint. You have already... ...seen the answer. That's the hint. I've seen it? Where is it? Where is it? Where? Oh... Where? This is a real special treatment. I'll give you another hint. Probably... ...many of the viewers know the answer. The viewers know? - you should die - lnouye live, i want to help with the answer lol - i want to tell you lol - is this the final execution? (can't wait) - i'm so broke i might die too - is this the final execution?
