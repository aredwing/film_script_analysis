And a one, two, three, four! (UP-TEMPO ORCHESTRA MUSIC PLAYING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Come on. Come on-a-rama. Come on. "Outlook not so good"? What? No way! You try, Mouse. (MEOWS) OK, Magic 8 Ball, last chance. This is gonna be the best, most way not boring summer ever, right? Signs point to... ..."Yes"! Yay! You rock, Mouse. Don't leave me hanging. WOMAN: Judy? You almost ready? The bus will be here in five minutes. Uh-huh! I'm totally (QUIETLY) almost (NORMAL VOICE) ready! WOMAN: Good. You don't want to be late for the last day of school. Let me see. Shoes, shoes, shoes, shoes. - Help me, Mouse! Where are my? Ah! - (MEOWS) Hairbrush, hairbrush, hairbrush. Oh, hairbrush! See, here's the thing, Mouse. You know how every summer is "S" for Snoresville because all I ever do is visit Grandma Lou and get a sunburn and pick my scabs and watch TV. And it's not even cable. But this summer is going to be different because I have a plan. A P-L-A-N for the most super duper, double-rare, not bummer summer ev... - WOMAN: Judy? - Coming! - (MEOWS) - Mouse. (SMACKS LIPS) - Look, Mom! - Hey. - BOY: Look, Dad. - Nice. Hi! Beat you to the bus, Stink. Bye! Is that a new trend? Wearing pajamas to school? Let's just be happy she remembered her shoes. (HORN HONKING) Rocky! Judy! Last day! No more homework, no more tests. No more fink-face Finch, the pest! Yeah! (COMMOTION) What's with the Mr. Potato Head hair? I wouldn't talk, Mr. "Frank Eats Paste" Pearl. - For me? - FYEO. "For Your Eyes Only." And Amy and Rocky. "TP Meeting... Shhh! Shhh. (WHISPERING)... after school for way important summer plan." What's going on? Is it the last day of school or something? ALL: Yay! Frank. Don't get too excited. There's still... ...three hours and 27 minutes until summer officially begins. (ALL GROANING) In fact, guess what I have here? Hot off the press. A pop quiz. What? No way! JUDY: On the last day of school?! Just a few questions to make sure that you were paying attention. All right. (CLEARS THROAT) Question number one. How many times did I wear a purple tie to school? - Twenty-seven! Twenty-seven! - A hundred! A hundred! - Never. - (BELL DINGS) "Never" is correct. Excellent, Jessica. - Ha-ha. - Fink-face Finch strikes again. - MR. TODD: Question number two. - Aww. - How long did it take our class - For me? - To go around the world? - ALL: Eight and a half days! - (BELL DINGS) - You guys are breezing through these. These are too easy for you. I gotta go deeper. Let's see, let's see, let's see here. Ooh, oh, this is a good one. This is a big one. Mucho grande. - Come on! Tell us! - OK, OK, OK. Can anyone guess, and this means you, class 3T, what I, Mr. Todd, will be doing this summer? (CLOCK TICKING) We need a clue! Give us a clue! ALL: Clue! Clue! Clue! Clue! Clue! Clue! Clue! Clue! Clue! Clue! - OK, OK. Hold it to a dull roar, dull roar. - (SHOUTING STOPS) - Let's see. - (BELL DINGS) Ooh! I have the perfect clue. The clue is... - (WIND HOWLING) - Brrr! ...cold. - Oh, refrigerator salesman! - That's not bad. - Snow remover guy. - That's clever. - Polar bear trainer! - That's dangerous. ROCKY: Snowball fight. Snowball fighter. Antarctica is cold. (DOGS BARKING) - JUDY: Mr. Todd? - Judy! Ooh! I know! You're going to Antarctica! The real one! That's a great guess, but sadly, no. - (BUZZER RINGS) - Any other guesses? All right. Well, don't say I didn't warn you. # Well, I come from the teachers' break room # With a banjo on my knee # Now listen up, dear students It's so elementary # World-class 3 You'll wanna look for me # 'Cause if somehow you find me # There's a prize, oh, yes, sir-ee! # You'll see me at the mall, the pool, the park and by the sea # And sometimes you'll find me at the public library # Oh, class 3 You'll wanna look for me # 'Cause if somehow you find me # There's a prize, oh, yes, sir-ee! (ALL SINGING) # You'll see me at the mall # The pool, the park and by the sea # And sometimes you'll find me at the public library # Oh, class 3 You'll wanna look for me # 'Cause if somehow you find me # There's a prize, oh, yes, sir-ee! # - (CHEERING) - (BELL RINGING) All right, kids, let's go! Let's go! Have a great summer! - Bye, Mr. Todd! Stay warm! - I will. Stay Judy! - Whoa! - Ooh! Last one in is a... Whoa! Hey, no fair! OK, TPers, are you ready for the most way rare, double-cool summer plan ever? Time out. What's a TPer? Oh, we forgot. Amy's not a member. - A member of what? - Of our club. - Quick, Frank, go find a toad. - Me? You find a toad. (GROANING) JUDY: Frank. (BOYS GROAN) Do you see anything? Rock. Rock. (CHUCKLING) Not a rock. (CROAKING) - Why am I doing this again? - (KIDS GIGGLING) Shh. You'll see. If he jumps on my face, you are so dead. - Do you feel anything? - AMY: Yeah. A toad. A fat, slimy... Ew! Something just got wet! - ALL: Toad pee! - (LAUGHING) - (AMY SCREAMS) - (CROAKING) - Gross! - Don't wipe it on her! - You are sick! - Sick awesome! And now you're a member of our club, the Toad Pee Club. Which means you're toad-ally cool. So... ...are you ready for my plan? Introducing the one and only Judy Moody Mega-Rare Not Bummer Summer Dare! I don't get it. OK, you know how we always hate summer because it's boring with a capital "B"? I don't hate summer. I love summer. Anyway, this'll solve all our problems. I spent two days and 16 erasers figuring it out. "Ride Scream Monster, surf a wave." - Are these the dares? - JUDY: Yup. So we do these dares, and for each one, we get ten Thrill Points. Plus Bonus Points if we do something crazy like, ride the Scream Monster with no hands. Or Loser Points if we chicken out. At the end of summer, we add it all up, and if we reach 100, then presto, whammo, we just had the best summer ever! Is that thrilladelic or what? Um, it's thrilladelic, only... ...I kind of forgot to tell you something. (MOUTHING SILENTLY) Um... He forgot to tell you that... ...he's going away for the summer. What? Yeah. To circus camp. I'm gonna learn how to walk on a tightrope, and do magic tricks and stuff. And I won't be here, either. I'm going to Borneo. You guys! I thought you were serious. Borneo? What even is Borneo? It's an island in Indonesia. And I am going with my mom. - We leave in a week. - Me too. On Friday. That is so not fair! How am I supposed to have the best summer ever, if you're not even here? I'm not going anywhere. You can have fun with me. Great. Just great. DAD: It looks like somebody's in a bad mood. Really? Who? She's mad because Rocky and Amy are going away for the summer. Could you please not talk with ABC peas in your mouth? DAD: ABC what? What? MOM: Already Been Chewed. - DAD: Oh. - (MOM GROANS) MOM: Guys. Oh... OK, guys. Mind your manners, please. Anyway, I could care less about Rocky and Amy. I mean, going to circus camp, that's lame. Rocky's going to circus camp? You know, that's a great idea. You know, I think his grandparents used to run that, the famous Circus - Zangzini. Right. - Zangzini. # A- B-C-D-E-F-G # Can we please not talk about Rocky? Hey, wanna know what I'm doing this summer? - I'm gonna catch Bigfoot. - Bigfoot? Where did you even hear about Bigfoot? Hello! He's all over the news. - Oh. - DAD: In the newspapers, too. Yeah, there have been Bigfoot sightings everywhere. Sally Rottenberger saw him in the mall. (STAMMERS) DAD: At the mall? I thought Bigfoot lived in the woods. But sometimes he has to buy stuff. There's no such thing. Is too. Wanna help me catch him? I'd rather catch poison ivy. - Oh, thank you. - Mom? Mm-hmm? Can I please, with ice cream and sprinkles on top, go to circus camp? Please? Honey, I'm sorry. It's just too expensive, you know? We can't afford it. But if I learn how to do circus stuff, I can quit school and you can loan me out to a circus - and I'll make gobs of money. Please. - OK, well... You're not quitting school and we're certainly not loaning you out to a circus. No one in this family has any imagination! And Rocky is a circus-freak, leave-me-behind un-friend! I am never, not ever speaking to him again! But what if you hate circus camp? Are you nuts? Why would I hate circus camp? Because it won't all be tons of fun. I bet they make you shovel elephant poop. Ha-ha. Good one. Yeah, and did you know it weighs like 200 tons? Plus, it smells worse than a corpse flower. - (HORN HONKS) - Are you ready for your send-off, Rock? # For # He's a jolly good fellow # He looks like a bowl of Jell-O # And all his teeth are yellow # Which nobody can deny # And now we're saying goodbye # And now we're saying goodbye # For he's a jolly good fellow # But now we're saying goodbye # Bye, guys! Miss you! See you in a while! Bye! Think of me when you're on elephant poop duty. I will. And also when I'm taming lions and juggling swords. - You ready, kiddo? - Yeah. (ENGINE STARTS) Bye. ROCKY: Bye, guys! Don't have too much fun while I'm gone! (SQUEAK TOY SQUEAKING) Remember, if camp is super boring, you can always come home! And don't say I didn't warn you about the poop! ROCKY: Oh, I forgot! I... (VOICE FADES) I can't hear you! (DEEP EXHALE) So why are you going to Bored-eo? Because of this lost tribe called the Penan. They've lived in the rainforest since forever, but all their land is being destroyed because of logging. So anyways, my mom's going there so she can write an article on them and hopefully we can save them. You're so lucky. I never get to save a lost tribe. I wish you could come. It's not that far away, you know. It's only like 9,000 miles. Lots of people go to Borneo for a vacation. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Does it cost like a zillion dollars? I don't think so. Then maybe we could go. There's no reason we have to spend every summer at Grandma Lou's, right? WOMAN: Amy? Are you packed? We leave in an hour. I'm ready! Go ask your mom! I will! See ya! In case she says no, here's something to remember me by. Sweet. Oh, Borneo, I long-e-o to visit you-e-o! Mom! Mom! - Oh, Mom! Guess what! - Yeah? I figured out how to save summer! Save summer? I didn't know it was in trouble. Listen to this. Instead of going to Grandma Lou's, boring, let's go to un-boring Borneo! Borneo? OK, you know that's like halfway around the world, right? So? It's got a rainforest. And lost tribes that need to get found. OK, but do you have any idea how expensive it would be... Oh, Stink! We're going to Borneo! But we need money-o, so let's have a yard sale! I'll sell my pizza table collection. MAN: That's right, five pizza tables, only $9.99! Call now! Ooh! You can sell your World's Biggest Jawbreaker. MAN: World's Biggest Jawbreaker, now only... No can do. Can't. I'm busy. - Are these cranberries? - Uh, yes. OK. Bye. What? Bye. OK, sweetie, can you just, um... You know what, sit down for a second. I just wanna talk to you about something. Um, so I was just on the phone with your other grandma, you know, my mom. And you know how she and Gramps are moving to that retirement community? Well, I'm afraid Gramps hurt his back, so he's gonna need a little help, so... You mean we're flying to California to visit them? - (GASPING) - Now... That's almost as good as Borneo! - Yes! Yes! - Hang tight for one second. Um, let me get a little more specific. - Thank you! Thank you! - If I could just... - Did you tell her? - Uh, not, not quite. - Honey. - Listen, jelly bean. Something's come up. Your mom and I have to fly to California in a few days... Yeah. ...and you and Stink... ...are staying here. What? You're going to leave me here? To die of starvation and boredom and Stink-dom? OK, kiddo, it is not gonna be that bad. Your Aunt Opal's coming. - Aunt who? - My sister. Judy, you've heard me mention her a million times. - So? I never actually met her. - You did when you were little. She could be totally evil. She could be a zombie for all I know. - Oh. - STINK: Do I look like a berry bush? - DAD: Uh... - I'm trying to fake out Bigfoot. Well, in that case, absolutely. - Oh, yes. 100 percent. - Definitely. Yes! Great! Bye! So let me get this straight. I'm not going to California. I'm not going to Borneo. I'm not going to circus camp. And now I'm not even going to Grandma Lou's? Then this is the way worst, double-drat, bummer summer ever! (JUDY GROWLS) (GROANS) This is supposed to be the summer of a hundred thrills. - But instead... - (HORN HONKING) STINK: Judy, it's the ice cream truck! I am so not in the mood! Ow. Dear Magic 8 Ball, could this summer get any worse? "Without a doubt"? (GROANS) (PURRING) - (GROANING) - (GROWLING) (MEOWS) MOM: Stink! Judy! Aunt Opal's here! (GROAN) DAD: Opal, you're here! - MOM: Opal! There she is! - DAD: Wow, it's been forever! (WOMEN SQUEALING) MOM: Group hug! (CHATTERING) JUD Y: "Dear Amy, summerjust got way worse. Aunt Awful has landed! Can't you please come home? Or else send me a ticket to Borneo?" DAD: Judy? Come down and say hi to your aunt! I can't! Not until September! I bet she has warts, Mouse. And evil, oogley boogley eyes. - And makes us eat fish guts for breakfast. - (MEOWS) Dad says come now or you're in big trouble. Can't you read the sign? Where it says I'm spending the summer in my room? Really? What about food? (MEOWING) I have a basket. You can put food inside and I'll lift it up. What about TV? Check it out. It's gonna be a periscope. - I'll be able to see the whole living room. - Cool. What about going to the bathroom? Stink, I'm a... - (ALARM BEEPING) - (MOM SCREAMING) - JUDY: What's that? - MOM: Dinner's on fire! Don't worry! I can put it out! Lobster! (STINK SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY) I can save us! I'll get water! OK, hurry, hurry, hurry! - (ALARM BEEPING) - I have water! I have water! I can put it out! Don't worry! - DAD: Careful! Hot! Hot! Hot! - MOM: Take it to the sink! DAD: OK, watch it! Sink! - Judy, you don't need to do that anymore! - Hey! JUDY: Don't worry, I can put it out! MOM: It's OK, Judy. (LAUGHING) Bull's-eye! Wow, it's the famous Judy Moody! (GROWLS AND CHUCKLES) You are so cute! Opal, you've only been here five minutes, and already the house is on fire. DAD: Unbelievable. OPAL: Wow, you got so much bigger. Do you remember this? Kinda. Wow. You've got more bracelets than my math tutor, and she's in college. Here, you wanna have this one? - It's made out of yak hair. - Really? I got it off a monkey for 500 rupees. Wow. Cool! Wow, thanks! Rare! OK, but here's your real presents. Stinker? Awesome! "So You Want to Catch Bigfoot?" Look, look, look, look! Awesome! Thank you, Aunt Opal! Thank you! Thank you! Yeah! Man, oh, man, oh, man! Ye-ye-yeah! I got a Bigfoot! Yeah! Book. Nice dance. OK. And this is your present. (GASPS) A mood ring? How did you know? I think you're a big hit, Ope. (MOUTHS SILENTLY) - You like it? - I love it! - Thank you! - MOM: (CLEARS THROAT) Guys, I'm so sorry to interrupt, but what do you wanna do about dinner? (GASPS) JUDY AND STINK: Pizza! A large Hawaiian Surprise and a pepperoni with tuna fish. Wanna go to Fur and Fangs while we wait? Sure. Yay, 'cause I wanna show Zeke my book and prove to you that Bigfoot exists. Right. - (HISSING) - (ANIMAL SOUNDS) (CHITTERS) (QUIETLY SQUAWKS) - PARROT: Thank you. - (DOOR OPENS) Hey, Zeke! Check this out! Hey, little dude. Whoa. Sweet. - It's a first edition. - (GASPS) ZEKE: Who's the girl? Are you a Bigfooter? That's my sister Judy, who doesn't believe in Bigfoot. Seriously? Mega-total super seriously. (CRACKING) Uh-oh. Show her, Zeke. Show her the proof. Do you think she can handle... ...the cave? The what? Bigfoot lives. Bigfoot lives. - (THUD) - Ow! (LOUD CLICK AND ELECTRICAL WHIRRING) MAN: Welcome to the headquarters of the Bigfoot Believers Association. Wow. - You finished it! It's great. - Thanks. What is this, a clubhouse for bats? Observe. (TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS) ZEKE: Yeti from the Himalayas. Sasquatch... - Sasquatch! - ... man-beast of the great Northwest. Momo along the mighty Mississippi. In the outback of Australia, he's Bunyip. Call him what you will, one fact is clear: (ECHOING) Bigfoot lives. Is this cool or what? In 1978, Appleston Morris captured definitive proof that the subgenus Gigantopithecus thrives in the modern era. ZEKE: That's his face. Check that out. Bigfoot, no longerjust for scientists. MAN: This is why they call it the Bigfoot. You see what I'm saying? This is like size 44 for a man. Now see it? And I got that photograph right there. Right there? Y'all see it right there? We've been meeting here for a year, ever since this guy up north spotted Bigfoot, and caught it on camera. Since then, we've been tracking down Bigfoot's every move. He is definitely headed our way. And now for the proof. - I keep it in cold storage. - (WIND HOWLING) Cold storage? Hey, do you know a Mr. Todd? Nope. Never heard of him. And now, prepare to have your mind blown. A rare certified photo of Bigfoot. - Look, but don't touch. - JUDY: Seriously? - That's a guy in a sweater. - STINK: You're nuts. - That is Bigfoot! - Agreed. If you need more proof, come to one of our meetings. Tuesdays at six. Can't. I'm busy on Tuesdays. From now until always. Come on, Stink. It's pizza time. (SIGHING) She'll be back. She'll be back. MOM: Well, I didn't know what the backyard was missing until I saw it. - DAD: It's Morocco in Virginia. - She really doesn't travel light. - Mm-mm. Right. - But she travels with lights. OPAL: I hope you guys saved room for my dessert! MOM: Oh, wow. Redecorated the patio and dessert. Opal, you spoil us! Hey, Stink. Oh, honey, don't read at the table. It's rude. I know, but look at this. Page 87. Bigfoot's bed. See, he stomps down on all the grass. Tah-dah! Tangerine fondue! - Do you remember this? - Uh-huh. You know... (CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY) Yeah. We're gonna... We're gonna finish packing, so... - Yeah. - But thank you. Enjoy, though, guys. Hot dogs for dessert? Yeah. I used to make this for your dad when we were kids. Are those Froot Loops? OPAL: Yeah. Dig in! Mmm. - That doesn't count. - But it's so oogley boogley! This is nothing. When I was in Bali, I ate grilled cockroaches. Ooh. Gross. I'll tell you what. If you take a bite, you can be in my club, the I Ate Something Gross Club. JUDY: A club? Rare! Just one bite and we're in? - Yeah. - Pass the hot dogs! OK, one, two, three. - Mmmm. - Mmmm. - OPAL: What do you think? - This is good! Needs more Froot Loops. (CHUCKLING) Triple high five, you guys. - Club members! United! - All right! OPAL: So after the Peace Corps, I trekked across the Sahara, and then I went to the Kunstschule in Berlin and I did all this really cool underground art stuff. And then I moved to Bali, which is so beautiful and I lived there until about a month ago. Mega-cool. Is that where belly dancing's from? It's Bali, not belly, silly. It's an island. (BOTH LAUGH) That tickles! So do you have any fun summer plans I should know about? Well, I was gonna have the best summer ever, but my friends ruined it. (GROANS) I hate when that happens. Seriously. We were gonna do all these dares and get Thrill Points. But they left, so no dares. I love dares. When I was in Kenya, somebody once dared me to ride in an ostrich race. My ostrich won, but I fell off at the starting line. You know what, Aunt Opal? You just gave me an idea. I mean, what if we still did the dare chart but made it a race? Me, Rocky, Amy and Frank? We could each do our own dares and keep track of our points! First one to get to a hundred wins! (SNORING) - (SNORES LOUDLY) - Whoa! (GROANS) Aunt Opal! - (CLICK) - Whoa! Oh! (SNORING CONTINUES) Oh, no. (CLATTERING) (SQUEAKS) - What is going on? - Shh! You'll wake Opal! (SNORING CONTINUES) (SNORES LOUDLY) She slept through that? Weird. I know, right? Hey, did you know that Bigfoot's only scared of two... Enough already with the Bigfeet! You don't wanna hear? Guinea pigs and... JUD Y: "Dear Amy and Rocky, uber-rare idea. Let's do a dare race, starting right now. First one to get to a hundred points wins! What do ya say?" (COMPUTER SEND SOUND) MAN: And the winner is Judy Moody! (COMPUTER BLEEP) It's from Rocky! ROCKY: A dare race? I am in. Check out what I did today! That's ten Thrill Points for sure, don't you think? Just you wait, Rocky Zang. Just you wait. - STINK: Bye. - DAD: I'm gonna miss you, buddy. MOM: I'm sorry to go. I love you. JUDY: Can you bring us back some California bubble gum? Ah, better yet, how about I chew some and I'll stick it on the wall in your honor. - STINK: Can we have candy for breakfast? - DAD: No. No. - JUDY: Have fun in California! - DAD: Listen. - MOM: No for breakfast. - STINK: Can I not take a shower? DAD: Yes, you have to take a shower. I love you, buddy. JUDY: Bye! Bye! (ALL SHOUTING) OK, synchronize watches. As of 2:12pm, Tuesday, July 7th, the thrill race is on! So what's the first dare? Scream Monster? Nope. This. We're gonna dress in leotards? No. Don't you see? He's walking on a rope. A tightrope? Above the ground? Death-defying. Oh, yeah. Where do we get a tightrope? Perfecto! What do you think you're doing? I'm building a trap for Bigfoot. I'm gonna lure him here with peanut butter. He loves peanut butter. That's on page 52. And then boom! A net will fall out of this tree and land on his head! Not out of this tree. It's mine. I called it. - You can't call a tree. - Really? Watch me. - Mine. - Mine. - Mine. - Mine! - Mine! Mine! Mine! - Mine! Mine! - FRANK: Guys, stop it! - (SHOUTING CONTINUES) FRANK: Let go! Let go! (HIGH PITCHED HORN BLARES) Ice cream! I scream! You scream! We all scream for Old King Kold's ice cream! - Yay! It's mine! It's mine! - (ICE CREAM TRUCK MUSIC PLAYS) Frank? Where are you going? To go get ice cream. But now's our chance, before Stink gets back! Come on! What's more important? Thrill Points or ice cream? OK, all right. (FINGERS CRACK) (GROANS) - Thank you. - Certainly. (INSECT BUZZING) (BUZZING STOPS) JUD Y: And now, the high-flying, death-defying Judy-a-rini will cross... ... um... (CRACKING) ... Niagara Falls! One slip and she'll fall to her doom! Rocky's only crossed a dinky grass field, but Judy is crossing the crashing cataracts of Niagara! - Whoa! - (AUDIENCE GASPING) - My goodness! - JUDY: Don't worry! The great Judy-a-rini will not fall! Whoa! Whoa! Get off, Frank! One at a time! Hurry up then! I wanna go get ice cream! Ten Thrill Points. Ten Thrill Points. - Ten Thrill Points... - (INSECT BUZZING) Mosquitoes! Incoming! Whoa! Stop wobbling me! I can't help it! There's a mosquito on my... (BOTH SCREAM) (COUGHING) Ha-ha, you missed it. I got fuzzy navel. (CAR HORN HONKING) Hey, Judy, ready for the Scream Monster? Hey, Judy! What's all this pink stuff? My prom dress. I have to take it to the cleaners. So first we go on the Tilt-a-Whirl. After we get ice cream. Right. And sno-cones. And corndogs. And gobs of gum. Rare! We'll be ready for the Scream Monster, for sure. (WHISTLE BLOWS) - BOTH: Stop! - (TIRES SCREECH) FRANK: Are you thinking what I'm thinking? # You'll see me at the mall # BO TH: # The pool, the park and by the sea ## Mr. Todd! FRANK: Mr. Todd? I was sure he'd be in there. Don't worry. We'll find him. We have all summer. - Yeah. - Scream Monster! (SCREAMING) Supercalifragilistic- expithrilladelic! Geez, Louise! How many Thrill Points is that? Ten. Plus Bonus Points for no hands. No food on the ride, kid. What? I'm not throwing all this out! MAN: Then step outta line. Frank! We've been waiting in line forever! Surrender the sno-cone! But it's so good. Seriously! We gotta start earning some Thrill Points because so far we have zero. You guys coming or going here? OK. JUDY: Frank? Frank! - This is it! - Thrill Points, here we come! Hands up! Every second counts! (RUMBLING) (GROANS) I'm... not so sure about this. What's wrong? (RUMBLING CONTINUES) Don't you dare! (GROANING) (SCREAMING) (MOANING) MAN: We now send you out to Tammy with this special Bigfoot report. Tammy? TAMMY: With one sighting at the pier, one at Colonial College one on Main Street, and one at Frog Lake, that makes five local sightings. Five! With me here is Herb Birnbaum, and he claims that Bigfoot was in his yard. Herb? Herb, show us what you've got. - (DOORBELL RINGS) - HERB: You see that? He ripped the lid right off that can and went straight for the peanut butter! TAMMY: But couldn't that be a raccoon? Well, yeah, but it could also be Bigfoot! - But it could also be Bigfoot! - (DOORBELL RINGS) Rose Birnbaum, Herb's wife. This is Tammy, reporting live from... (GASPS) (HORN HONKING) Whoa. What happened to you? Don't ask. Seriously. Don't ask. (POUNDING ON DOOR) I told you not to ask! I'm not asking. I'm telling you. - Telling me what? - You got a postcard from Rocky. Really? Can you read it? Sure. (AFFECTED VOICE) "Dear Judy, how are you? I am fine." Can you read it like a normal person? You don't want me to sound like Rocky? - Just read it, OK? - OK. "Dear Judy, how are you? I am fine. - Guess what? - ROCKY'S VOICE: Guess what? BOTH: I just learned how to saw someone in half!" - No fair! I want to do that! - (BUBBLING) ROCKY: We even get to be in a real circus. BOTH: "You have to come, OK? August 4th." ROCKY: Just so you know, I'm up to 37 Thrill Points! (ECHOING) How many do you have? MAN: Please welcome Rocky the Magnificent, who is merely the assistant to Judy, - the Even More Magnificent! - (CROWD CHEERING) And now... ...let's watch the master - (BOINGING) ...at work. (METAL RINGING) I warned you not to throw up on me. Can you put me back together later? I think so. - What did you say? - I said, I think so. You think so what? Nothing! Never mind! Hey, you wanna go to my Bigfoot meeting? It starts in 15 minutes. Stink, I told you a bazillion trillion times, Bigfoot is for bozos! OK. Just don't be asking for my autograph when I catch him and get all famous. (SIGHING) (BUBBLING) Hmm. Let's see. Ten points for riding the Scream Monster. Minus five for blue throw-up, and five for prom dress equals... (MEOWING) You're right, Mouse. A big fat donut. (LOUD CRASHING) Holy macaroni! Whoa! What's all that? Hey. OK, I can't tell if this should be a hat, or a wheel, or... ...a shield. Um... I think it's the lid to the garbage can. Yeah, I know, but what is it really? (CLANGING) Wow. What is all this, anyway? It's my traveling art studio. Wow. Cool. You really are an artist. Yeah. I'm a guerrilla artist. Gorilla? As in monkey? No, as in under the radar. A guerrilla artist makes art out of everything, and puts it everywhere. Why? 'Cause it's fun. And it's daring. (GASPS) I have an idea. (WHISPERING) Ta-da! Wow, I love it! I told you it was a hat. That looks great! Look, we're beautifying the world with our amazing art! - Great! - Now all we have to do is sneak over to the library late at night and put our hats on the lions. (GASPING) Rare! That's ten Thrill Points for sure! Guess what! Zeke gave me homework. He said to look for Bigfoot scat! JUD Y: Scat: Noun. Scientific term for animal droppings, also known as poop, dung or doodoo. But that's not its only meaning. (SNICKERING) Are you sure he wasn't telling you to scat? Scat: Verb. Slang term meaning to exit, scram or go away. Gotcha, Stink. - (GROANING) Judy. Ice cream! - (HORN BLARES) - (EXCLAIMING) - (ICE CREAM TRUCK MUSIC) Wait! Help! Stop! Hey, my hand is stuck! My hand is glued to the table! - (GASPING) - Yeah, help! - OK, I'll be right back. - Stinker! Buy me an ice cream! Please? I'm coming to save you. This won't take long. I hope. OPAL: OK, this spatula is our last hope. - Want some? - An ABS? Already Been Slobbered? No, thanks. It's gonna be OK. OK, more leverage. Hang in there. (CLATTERING) More pressure. Almost! (GRUNTING) Almost... - Almost... - (POPPING) (GIGGLING) Free! Free! Free at last! In only an hour and 17 minutes and 45 seconds. (SIGHING) This was the worst day of my life. I'm sorry. I'll do anything you want. Anything to make it up to you. - Anything? - Mm-hm. Well, tomorrow night, there's a Cemetery Creep 'n Crawl. Can we go? I don't know. Is it worth Thrill Points? Yes. Then totally. Absolutely. Yes, yes, yes! (BIRDS CHIRPING) (MUSIC ON HEADPHONES) Where should I put the scat in, Opal? Fridge or freezer? Whatever. It's your animal poop. OK. I think freezer. Hey, Judy, we're gonna leave at seven, and then we're gonna eat our picnic at the cemetery. - What do you think? - Yeah! Extra points for eating with skeletons! And I need 'em, 'cause Amy just swam with sharks! Lemme see, lemme see! Whoa. Wow, swimming with a shark. That's cool. (SPLATTING) You're gonna lose this race so bad. Hey, look, your ring is green! Green with envy! Green like pond scum! Green like boogers! Stink, you're an intergalactic booger. Hey, where are you going? To the cemetery. We're walking, right? It's miles from here. We have to take Humphrey. Who's Humphrey? That's what our dad calls our car. No way! You know, your dad had a bike named Humphrey when we were kids. Let's take bikes! Not allowed after dark. Oh. (HISSING) Bummer. Let's do this! (CLATTERING) Oh! OK. Steering wheel, gas, brakes. Ignition. Frog. You know how to drive, right? - (ENGINE STARTING) - Of course. I drove across the Horn of Africa. (BOTH YELLING) Watch out! That was ten years ago. I'm sorry. R is for reverse. Got it now. (TIRES SCREECHING) (KIDS SCREAMING) (GASPING) - Whoa! - You call that driving? No worries. It'll come back to me. (SIGHING) Is there a map or something? 'Cause I have no idea where I'm going. Got one. (BIKE HORN) - GIRL: Ha-ha! - (TOOTING HORN) JUDY: Jessica Finch? Can you get a ticket for driving too slow? All right, backseat driver. - (TIRES SCREECHING) - (BOTH SCREAMING) (ALL SCREAMING) Watch out! You're gonna hit the... ...bouncy castle! (BRAKES SQUEALING) Holy... crap! You said crap! Crap is a swear! Crap is not a swear. Yes! - (PANTING) - Sorry, little man! (BIRDS SQUAWKING) (ENGINE SPUTTERING) And we are out of gas. And way super lost. Are we still in Virginia? Of course we are. Look, it's Larkspur Pier. It's Virginia's number one tourist attraction. Whoa. JUDY: Looks more like Virginia's number one ghost town. Can we eat? I'm starving. (OPAL SIGHING) Isn't it cool, Judy? Wow, we're in the Un Zone! How cool is that? The Un Zone. Get it? - It's cool. - That's so funny. Look, I have baloney for you. And turkey for Stink. Yummy, yummy. Delicious sandwich. - Ooh, I brought ketchup. - Oh, yes. I remembered the ketchup for you. (SNIFFING) This smells funny. Almost like... Oh, look, a seagull. I like seagulls. - Bon apptit! - Bon what? - Oogley boogley! - Ooh, what is that? It's scat! Doodoo! Dung! Poop! (ALL SHRIEKING) - Disgusting! - Gross, gross! (GROANING) - Crap! - That too. Eww. JUDY: "Dear Rocky, Have you ever been on a poop picnic? - I have and it stinks on ice! - (CHATTERING) Hardee-har-har!" Be quiet, you guys! I can't hear myself write! Sorry! So, the right is the gas, the left is the brake. - Mmm. - OK? - OK. Vroom! - (TIRES SCREECHING) Not that fast! Gentle, gentle. - (LAUGHTER) - (CRASHING NOISES) "So what else stinks about this summer?" Let's see. JUD Y: "'Surf a wave' sounds thrilladelic." Great! Good job. "Just never try it with Mr. Sponge Frank Squarebottom. " - All right, Judy, ready? - Ready! - Frank, you ready? - Ready, Frank? - Look out for the wave! - (FRANK GURGLING) (YELLING) - Come back, Frank! - No! Come back! JUD Y: "And remember Mr. Todd's challenge? Find him and get a prize? I got a prize, all right. " BOTH: Mr. Todd! "The cuckoo-head prize. And Amy can't stop sending mega-thrill pics from Borneo. (GULPING, BURPING) If you ever go to ride an elephant, Rocky, be careful. " "Ride an elephant, today only." (ELEPHANT TRUMPETING) OPAL: Sorry. "With my luck, you end up giving the elephant a ride. So Mr. Todd is supposed to be somewhere cold, right?" Mr. Todd? (BOTH GROANING) "Well, he isn't working in the bakery freezer, that's for sure. And he wasn't at the mall, the pool, the park, or by the sea. Mr. Todd is nowhere. You and Amy aren't even here and you'll probably find him before me. I'm so desperado for Thrill Points, Aunt Opal tried to help me put hats on the lions at the library, but we missed the bus. (THUNDER CRASHING) At the worst possible time. - (LAUGHING) - And all we got were Un-Points. Aunt Opal says, "When all else fails, dance." (POP MUSIC PLAYS) (NEEDLE SCRATCH, MUSIC STOPS) (MUSIC STARTS AGAIN) So I tried to make that into a Thrill Point game. I love dancing, so that'd be easy peasy, right? - (NEEDLE SCRATCH, MUSIC STOPS) - Wrong." STINK: You lose Thrill Points. (MUSIC STARTS AGAIN) - (NEEDLE SCRATCH, MUSIC STOPS) - STINK: Freeze! - Whoa! - "I lost every round. (MUSIC STARTS AGAIN) And how many Thrill Points do I have after one whole summer of trying? Nada, zip, zero, zilch points. So, Rocky, can you please think up more dares for me? 'Cause otherwise I'm gonna be a no-point, dare-doing loser!" OPAL: Hey, Judy, Frank's here! JUDY: Coming! Hey, Judy! Ready for the evil creature double feature? - Yup. - Me, too. Let's go. Who are you? - Bride of Frankenstein. - And I'm Frankenstein. FRANK: We even have matching rings. (SINGING) Judy and Frank, sitting in a tree! K-l-S-S-l-N-G! Do you want me to feed you to Jaws? - Um-um-um-um. - Then take it back. G-N-l-S-S-l-K. Let's go. Bye, Aunt O... whoa. - Are you making pancakes? - No way. This is plaster of Paris. Wow. Mom and Dad would freak if they saw this mess. Oh, yeah. You should really get out the vacuum and clean it up. I think you should get out the fire hose. See ya. Bye. You look great. I love your costume. - Two, please. - I want to take your money! (CREEPY LAUGH) How come you're wearing a ski jacket? It's August. 'Cause it's freezing in there. The air conditioner's gone psycho. Did he say freezing? As in cold? (YELLING) Mr. Todd? (CLATTERING) (CHATTER RESUMES) Search everywhere. Is one of you Mr. Todd? Nope and nope. Mr. Todd, is that you? Mr. Todd? - Mr. Todd? - Mr. Todd? I give up. Mr. Todd's probably training penguins in the North Pole or something. Or something. (CHUCKLING) (PIERCING SCREAMS) Remember, no being a wimpburger. We have to stay to the end if we wanna get points. Don't look at me. You're the one who'll be screaming... Holy eyeball! Good thing he's dead already. - (GASPING) - Watch it. It's true. The dead are among us. They have taken over the small town of Pittsylvania. Lock your doors. Bolt your windows. Head for the basement. And if you don't have a basement... ... build one. (ZOMBIES GROANING) Uh, you know what? I gotta go home. I forgot to feed my goldfish. Sit down. This is our absolute last chance to earn Thrill Points! Airhead, Frankenstein, shh! (BRAKES SCREECHING) (GROWLING) I come for dinner. I come for you! (GRUNTING) Hungry. I hungry for you, Frank! He said my name! He said my name! You are not leaving! Let go! You are dead, Frank Pearl! No! Zombies are dead! I'm going home. Great! Rocky and Amy are breaking the record for the funnest summer ever, and I'm stuck with Franken-screamer. Hey! Rocky and Amy wouldn't bail after two seconds of zombies. Rocky and Amy wouldn't knock me off a tightrope. Rocky and Amy wouldn't puke all over me. Well, look who's talking! All your stupid points and dares and charts! They suck the fun out of everything! You're like a big, wet fun sponge! Fun sponge? Well, if I'm a fun sponge, then you're a fun mop! Uh, hold on there, bridezilla. - Where's your ticket? - It's inside. It's in my backpack. Sorry. No ticket, no movie. (FRUSTRATED GROAN) Fun sponge, my elbow! What is that? It's Bigfoot! I'm a guerilla gorilla artist now, huh? STINK: Check out the head! Do you wanna help? I'd love to, only I can't because I'm going to spend the rest of this bummer summer in my room! Look out. She's in a mood. Am not! (DOOR SLAMMING) Eighty-five points already? Rocky! (YELLING) - (HORN BLARES) - OPAL: Judy! It's the ice cream truck. What? (SCOFFING, GROANING) Come back in September. I think this is gonna be melted by then. So you wanna spend the rest of the summer in your room? I might as well. It's already completely, for sure ruined. Besides, Frank, my "used to be second best friend but now he's my enemy," called me a fun sponge. Wow. That's bad. Are you a fun sponge? No way! He's the sponge. It's his fault I can't get any Thrill Points! Right. Thrill Points. Well, they're important. You can't have a not bummer summer without them. Totally, duh. I mean, that's like the number one rule of summer. We have to find a way for you to get the Thrill Points. What about, you know, we didn't put the hats on the lions yet. The hats got all ruined, remember? There's gotta be something else. It's impossible, Aunt Opal. I've already thought of absolutely, positively everything. There's gotta be more. Let's go on Google. - Let's Google "fun." - (MEN CHATTERING) What's that? WOMAN: Testing, testing. You got a close-up of Bigfoot, right? - MAN: Looks great. - (GASPING) - And your name is? - James Moody. But everyone calls me Stink. Stink is apparently building a statue of Bigfoot to commemorate the monster who may be lurking nearby according to 27 recent eyewitness reports. Now, most people think Bigfoot isn't real. How do you answer that? Well, people don't think giant squids are real, either. Well, they are, and so is Bigfoot. And I'm gonna catch him! WOMAN: If you do catch him, Mr. Stink Moody, you'll be the most famous kid in America. You'll put this town on the map! (CAMERAS CLICKING) (RUMBLING) (ROARING) (GULPING) (GROWLING ROAR) (STARTLED EXCLAMATION) (CHITTERING) (CAMERAS CLICKING) (QUIZZICAL GRUNT) For years, people have searched for Bigfoot but only Judy Moody could find him. How many Thrill Points is that worth, do you think? A million. But who's counting? (QUIZZICAL GRUNT) In honor of your courageous actions we are renaming this town Judy Moodyville! - (CROWD APPLAUDING) - Come on down, Judy, and put this town on the map! (HAPPY GRUNTING) REPORTER: Well, thank you, Stink Moody. As your quest for Bigfoot continues, we wish you luck. This is WH2O, broadcasting live... Don't forget me! I'm a Bigfooter, too! You are? It's Judy Moody, with a J. And a U-D-Y. Did you get that? Uh, yeah. Uh-huh. - (TIRES SCREECHING) - JUDY: Bye! Since when were you a Bigfooter? Since one minute ago. Listen, is Bigfoot really, truly, for absolute positive real? Twenty-seven people can't be wrong. Then I will help you find him. Yeah! But how come? Because this is my absolute last chance to get Thrill Points, and if we actually catch Bigfoot, - I might even win the race! - Huh? Nothing, never mind. Just tell me everything. Got it. And dogs always howl whenever they see him. That's on page 37. Zeke can tell you more. He's like a Bigfoot encyclopedia. OK, Bigfooters. Tuesday's meeting is now called to order. - Herb and Rose? - Present. - Stink? - Present. - New member? - Judy Moody. Present. ROSE: Oh, she looks like a smart cookie. (WHISPERING) Where is everyone? This is it. This is our club. - And we welcome you. - Get a picture of that. Better late than never. - Rose? Do you have a report? - Three new sightings! That's the most we've gotten in one week. Excellent! Give me the coordinates. One saw Bigfoot taking laundry off her clothesline. 57 Ashbury Road. It's a mile east of the mall. Gotcha. Another saw something large and furry at the dump. The third swears he saw Bigfoot last night at the corner of Croaker and Jefferson. Croaker and Jefferson? BOTH: That's where we live! - You live there? - Yeah. - Did anybody say anything? - 117 Croaker. This calls for an all-night surveillance! - Are you guys up for it? - You mean like a stake-out, with flashlights and secret codes and stuff? - I got a whole book of codes. - All right! Yes! Thrill-o-rama! Herb, Rose, you're in charge of equipment. Troops, we've got everything you need. Camouflage netting. - Check. - Check. - Night-vision goggles. - BOTH: Check. - Camcorder with whistle. - BOTH: Check. - Check, check. - Thermoses with coffee. - Herb, they don't drink coffee. - (GROANING) Good luck, team. - I will call with any sighting updates. - Sir. OK, that's the lot of it. Now remember, if you need back-up, this van is at your service. STINK: August 3rd, 8:06pm. The trap is set, and the Bigfoot stake-out is on. This is Stink Moody, reporting live. (GIGGLING) You look like Owl Girl! These don't work. I can't even see. That's because it's not dark yet. - Oh. - OPAL: Hey. Are you ready? Let's go over the plan. You two will sleep in the tent. - Check. - If you see or hear anything, you will contact me immediately on this walkie-talkie. That's Stink's old baby monitor. Whatevs. Let's call it the walkie-talkie. What is the signal? - (FEEDBACK) - Code Red! Code Red! Awesome. What happens if you fall asleep and Bigfoot attacks us, and we're half-eaten before you get downstairs? - (SCOFFING) - He won't attack us. I know Bigfoot sign language. This means, "I am your friend." And this means, "Your head was delicious." OK, Bigfoot's not gonna eat any heads, all right? Because we're remembering this vow: We will not... ALL: Fall asleep! (SNORING) (DISTANT NOISES) (NOISES CONTINUE) JUDY: Stink, wake up! Code Red. Code Red. - Aunt Opal, Code Red! Code Red! - (SNORING) Geez, Louise! Holy macaroni! It's... It's him! Gotcha! (SCREAMING) Bigfoot! Code Red! Code Red! FRANK: Help. - Frank? - Judy? What are you doing here? Well, I got my dad to go back to the theater and pick up our packs, and I thought I could just drop it off in your tent or something so you'd find it, only I bumped into a jar and then you hair-netted me! Sorry. I thought you were Bigfoot. Why would I be Bigfoot? (CHUCKLING) You scared Judy's pants off, Frank! - Did not. - You were screaming your head off. - JUDY: No, I wasn't. I was... - (DISTANT MOANING) (GULPING) Bigfoot? - Bigfoot. - Impossible. That was an owl. (HOOTING) That was an owl. Or Bigfoot pretending to be an owl! Come on, let's go! I have to get my camcorder! Are you coming, Frank? It's worth mega-mega-points! Um, I'd love to, - but, um... - (CAR HORN HONKS) Oh, that's my dad. Gotta go! Bye! STINK: Set for night vision! (ANIMALS CHITTERING) Maybe it really was an owl. Nuh-uh. That was him. Bigfoot is famous for his owl sounds. Page 11. - (HOOTING) - (GASPS) You go first. I'll hold the light. You go first. I'm filming. OK, scaredy pants. But stay close. JUDY: Not that close. - STINK: Then go faster. - JUDY: No way. (DISTANT ANIMAL SOUND) (DISTANT ANIMAL CALL) (CRACKING) (RATTLING) (DISTANT MOANING) STINK: What was that? Shh. Stop. Look. There! - Is that some kind of bed? - Yeah, a Bigfoot bed. Remember from the picture? This must be where he sleeps. Then where is he? He must've heard us coming. (DISTANT ANIMAL SOUND) He's probably watching us. Mr. Bigfoot? We come in peace! (ECHOING) Hello? Can you hear me? - (POSSUM SHRIEKS) - (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (SCREAMING STOPS) (YAWNS) There! See? That's his bed! Whoa. Do you really think it's his? He was there. I know it. All I know is I got a face full of possum and zero Thrill Points. Don't give up. You can do it. It can take years to catch a monster. But I don't have years. I need Thrill Points now. (BARKING) - (MOANING) - Look! Look, it's Bigfoot! Look, there are the dogs! Quick! After him! (ALL SHOUTING) (BARKING) - There! After him, go! Go, go! - (MOANING) Whoa! Don't stop! - Go! Go! Go! - Come on! Come on! We have to catch him before he gets to Main Street! The cars will drive him cuckoo! BOTH: Page 73! (BARKING CONTINUES) - Did you see that? - He's hijacking the ice cream truck! We'll never catch him now. (HORN HONKS) Stop! I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we need this bike... - Jessica. ...Jessica. This is a matter of extreme national emergency. - Who are you? - I am Opal, the special agent in charge of the apprehension of large unidentified creatures. We are requisitioning all available bicycles. Thank you for your service to your country. JUDY: Watch out for the! STINK: Get it off, get it off! I can't see anything! - (TIRES SCREECH) - OPAL: Sorry! - STINK: Get it off! I don't like this! - JUDY: I'm gonna fall off! I can't hang on! Take it off! - OPAL: Oh, I can see! - Look, the ice cream truck! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (ALL SCREAMING) ALL: Stop! STINK: Bigfoot, come back! (ICE CREAM TRUCK MUSIC PLAYS) (HORN HONKS) Now what? (BRAKES SCREECH) Hey, we just got a report! Bigfoot's in... - The ice cream truck. We know! - Get in! Buckle up, everybody. - Should I drive? - JUDY AND STINK: No! This is Herb Birnbaum reporting a large runaway man-gorilla known as Bigfoot who appears to have commandeered an ice cream truck. - Left! Turn left! - Go left, Rose! JUDY: Faster! I have to tell you, this is my first official car chase. Really? We get in two or three of these a week. HERB: Hit it! Hit it! ROSE: Hang on, everybody. Commencing infrared warning device! - (SIREN BLARES) - Is that legal? When you're chasing a man-gorilla, son, anything is legal. - Anything! - (ROSE SHOUTS) - HERB: Whoa! - OPAL: Whoa! It's a cloaking device! Like the movies! (BRAKES SCREECH) Windshield wipers! JUDY AND STINK: Go, go, go! Oh! Wait till you see my supersonic tracking device. That's really like the movies. Wow, that's cool! You, sir, are an artist. I programmed it with 200 different Bigfoot sounds. The minute it picks up the slightest... - (CRASHING) - (OPAL SCREAMS) Herb, I told you to use a lag bolt! - HERB: All right. - JUDY: Look out! - That's the news van! - That interviewed me! Follow that news! (HONKING) (HONKING) - (HONKING) - Look out! Watch out! Watch out! Outta the way! Outta the way! (SIREN BLARING) There! Hey, look! It's the poop picnic place! Hey, kids, wait! Wait! You'll need a protective suit! Shh. - Mr. Todd? - MR. TODD: Judy! (CHUCKLING) Long time no see! What's going on? - We were saving you from... - Bigfoot! - Get back! Get back! - (MOANING) Bigfoot. Whoa. - ALL: Zeke?! - HERB: I don't believe this! We received at least 76 calls this morning! JUDY: It's my teacher! STINK: It's Zeke! - I can't believe he's the ice cream guy! - Since when are you Bigfoot? - Why didn't you stop for us? - Well, when? A madcap ride through town has led us to this pier. Hey, I love your cool suit. You look awesome. Thanks. - I'm Mr. Todd, Judy's teacher. - Hi, I'm Opal. And this is Bigfoot. I hired him to help me sell ice cream. With all the Bigfoot mania around here, he'll really help me drum up business. He's way better than the arrow-pointing guy. Why didn't you tell me that you knew Mr. Todd? - I've been looking for him all summer. - Yeah. Dudes, chill. I only met the Toddster this morning. Yet there are two questions that still remain: Is the real Bigfoot still at large? And will he show up for the circus? - The circus? - Yup. It's today, right here at the pier. And remember, you get a prize if you find me. - (GASPS) - Front row seats! Wow, thanks! Are we the first ones to find you? Not exactly. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Thanks for getting me a ticket to the circus. Yeah, sure. Sorry I was such a fun mop. Sponge. - Whatever. Want some? - (GROANS) ZEKE: Bigfoot loves cotton candy. Look! (ELEPHANT TRUMPETS) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Hey, it's Rocky! And he's sweeping elephant poop! I knew it! Hey, Rocky! Hey! - JUDY: Hey! - Hey, Judy! Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the Zangzini Family Circus! Let the show begin! Do we have a volunteer from the audience? Someone brave enough to get sawed in half? Me, me, me! Hmmm. - OPAL: Pick Judy! - JUDY: Pick me, me! Pick the girl in the green. You, young lady! (CROWD APPLAUDING) - Hey, Judy. - Hey, Rocky! Ooh, I missed you so much. I missed you, too. Hop in. (AUDIENCE GASPS) Watch this. Ta-da! Wow, Rock! Judy, that is uber-cool! OK, could you put her back together now, please? Yeah, 'cause we only just got home, and we'd like our little girl in one piece. JUDY: Don't worry, Mom. It really didn't hurt that much. AMY: Can we try, Judy? FRANK: "We"? You try it! AMY AND JUDY: Frank! Can I borrow Judy tonight? They're way too serious. Don't you think? (GROWLING) Ta-da! - You fixed them! - Yup. Wow! (GROWLING) JUDY: Yay! We did it! We did it! (BOTH CHEERING) Yay! Oh, I'm so happy! Aren't you glad you didn't spend the rest of your summer in your room? Oh, for sure and absolute positive. I wouldn't have put a hat on a lion or gone on a stake-out - or fallen off a tightrope. - Or had a poop picnic. Or found Mr. Todd. Or been in a car chase. Or gotten sawed in half. Or met you. Hey, I've got an idea. How about you don't leave tomorrow? How about you come live with us? Oh. (GROANS HAPPILY) What about this: Next summer, I'm thinking of wrapping the Eiffel Tower in 10,000 scarves. - Do you wanna help me? - For real? That would be on-top-of-spaghetti rare! I never thought we could top this summer, but Paris? Wow! Paris. Next summer. Be there! I love you! - MOM: Bye! - JUDY: Love you back! STINK: Bye! See you next summer! OPAL: Goodbye, Judy! Bye, Stink! This was the best! Bye! OPAL: I love you! Fifty cents to touch Bigfoot! Fifty cents to touch this? Are you nuts, Stink? Do you have change for a dollar? Yes! Sure. - Hey, thanks for fixing my bike. - Yeah, sure, no problem. - (SQUISHING SOUND) - Eww. (KIDS CHATTERING) BOY: Awesome! Fifty cents to touch Bigfoot! Hey! This was my idea. Aunt Opal says art belongs to everyone. Besides, I have to earn money for the Eiffel Tower! - Fifty cents a touch! - (MEOWING) JUDY: For a dollar, Bigfoot will shake your hand! DAD: Or better yet, for a hundred dollars we'll move him to your yard! For a thousand dollars, I'll tell you where the real Bigfoot lives! (POP MUSIC PLAYS) (MOANING) (GASPS) Don't do that. That's not in the script. Mom! Whoa! (BOTH GROAN) (SCREAMS) Just wait a sec. - OK, OK. - Cut.
