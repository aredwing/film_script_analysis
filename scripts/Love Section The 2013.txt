Make sure you do it before Judge Mathis, man. You know how we do! That's funny, The love section. That's cute. So are you. Thank you. No, see, that's not right. It's not a Don Juan pick-up line. It sounds like it. STEPH: What is it? You sure you're not pimping? STEPH: What about you? In the comedy club recruiting? Right. Ah, see you guys are funny. No, all I'm saying is it's a figure of speech. STEPH: Mmm-hmm. Like, life is good. Seriously? Like seriously, Chris! Why? Why? Why? You digging up your nose and we trying to eat. Correction, I'm simply grooming my nose hairs. "Simply grooming" your nose hairs? See, this is why we didn't work in the first place. No, we didn't work because you're a broke ass! Excuse me? Broke ass, you're excused. Let me tell your little cheap ass something. You know what, next time... Time out, folks. Folks! Chill. Guess what? Guess what? Guess what? My dog just died. I gotta go. (SANDRINE LAUGHS) What dog? Her name is Chris. You ain't got no dog! Not no more. The bitch died! She choked on a mother... She choked on a frank. Check, please. (JOEL HUMMING) Focus, buddy, focus. It's okay, I'm about to free my people right now. This is the last game, bro. Two out of three ass-whoopings is enough. I'm not trying to lose your friendship over no game, man. Whatever! Chess gods are just shining on you, that's all. Hmm. I'm about to get down here, and talk to your pieces. Y'all don't know each other, but that's why you always lose. You know, the gods of love shining on you the other night, though. What's up with the cutie at 9:00? Oh, Sandrine! Yeah. I'm gonna call her tonight. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't look too thirsty, you know what I'm saying? Smart move! Thank you. Not that move. Checkmate! Oh! Damn, damn, damn! So, what's the 411 on her? Well, she's 20, in school. And has a son. Yeah, but he's not in the picture. He live in Africa? No, he's in LA. Then he's still in the picture, man! (JOEL GROANING) Okay, what's up? What's up? So he's 32, huh? He's a player in his prime. How many kids? No kids. No kids? Look, see, that ain't nothing but selfishness. And he's afraid to take actual responsibility, and I don't like it. I don't like it. Maybe he's just waiting for the right woman, Steph. Yeah, I wouldn't bet on it. So anyway, where does he work? Or does he? You are gonna overdose on all that hate, right now. No, seriously. Seriously. I was just saying! What? He's a real estate agent. She sounds perfect! A perfect chick on the side, man. But not wifey? Er, I mean... Look, she has the looks to be wifey. You know what I'm saying? But, I mean, she's 20, you're 32, that's strike one. Baby daddy is still lurking loosely in the building, B! That's strike two! And lastly, she's still in school which means no dough. That's strike three, homey. (SIGHS) Hmm. Does he rent or does he own? Why? He rents. Give me my cup. Give me my cup. I'm not playing with you. I'm serious, right there. What? Rent? Rent? Seriously? What's that mean? A real estate agent that rents an apartment? Do you want your drink or do you want to know what that means first? I wanna know what that means. Super underachiever. That's what that means. Here. Seriously, that ain't right. Thank you. Look, I love you. I do. But you acting like I'm gonna marry this guy tomorrow though. Well, all I'm saying is I don't want you falling for another Jamal on my watch. See, 'cause I don't have the time for it. What are you talking about? I met Jamal when I was 15! Like, don't you think I'm a better judge of character by now? (MIMICS) Don't you think I'm a better judge of character by now? No! What I'm saying... Look, perfect example, Troy! Oh, boy. Troy! Okay, so I used to think Troy was America's number one deadbeat dad, in the world. But anyway, ever since Jamal started coming around, seriously, he makes Troy look like Bill Cosby. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) No, no, no. Jamal's trying. Now, who's at the door? Who you expecting? Nobody! Who you expecting? (SARCASTICALLY) I don't know. I don't know. Oh, speaking of the devil. Hey, Jamal. What up? What up? Why are y'all so quiet? What? You been talking about me again and stuff? No! (COUGHS) A little bit. Whatever, Steph. What's up? Hey, how you doing? Why you always acting so paranoid? I am not paranoid, just Scary Spice over here gossip too damn much. Anyway, um, just wanted to give you this. Thank you. Yeah, so... Junior's with my mom. Oh, okay. Okay. What you looking at? Anyway, buy my little man something nice. And get yourself something, too. Thanks, Jamal. All right. Bye, Jamal. (DOOR CLOSES) I want Ali's first name, last name, social security, credit card number, everything. Seriously! I'm telling you, I've been thinking about you since we left the diner. (SANDRINE LAUGHS) You could've fooled me. We met Sunday. Today is what? Thursday? Well, I figured since you're in school and stuff... Oh, yeah? Or is it the three-day rule? (LAUGHS) No comment! Look, Mommy, Little Young Sheezy! Hold on. Mmm-hmm, it's Little Young Sheezy, baby. Go to bed. Okay. Bye. Little Young Sheezy? Yeah! You never heard of him? No, I haven't. How about DJ Shorty Rap-a-lot? (ALI LAUGHS) DJ Shorty Rap-a-lot? No. I think I'm out the loop. Well, what kind of music do you like? I like my classic hip-hop and, of course, a little R&B. Me, too. Really? Okay, well, give me your top five singers of all time. Top five singers, okay. Um, Sade. Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige... Um, Sade, Mary J. Blige, Aretha... Luther, Big and Little Luther. And, um, who else? Marvin Gaye. Hmm, nice. I thought I might hear Ray J coming out of your mouth. No, no, no. All right, your turn. Your top five emcees. Go! Emcees? Whoa, you didn't say rappers, you said emcees? Okay, okay. Yeah, it's a difference, and if Heavy D is not on your list, then I'm hanging up. Hev D? Girl, what do you know about Hev D? You're like 20. Yeah, my dad used to always tell me I'm a old soul. He used to? Yeah, he passed away two years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay. Yep, just me, myself and I. Okay, Beyonce. More like De La Soul. So, I figured, um, I'll bake a little chicken, grill some corn, some rice. How does that sound? Hello? Sandrine? Hello? Michael, I told you ahead of time, as soon as your offer to buy the house was accepted, you needed to get those inspections. Ali, all I care about is my wife not telling me, "I told you so" about buying this house. Now, I told her I got this! That means, you got this! All you got is me paying a bunch of inspection fees. I'm not paying, like, a what, a physical fee, a roof fee, a termite fee? And my toilet? My whole house? This toilet got my whole house smelling like diarrhea! Didn't I tell you to get a sewer scope inspection? Come on, bro, I don't remember that. Michael, I told you and I e-mailed you. Ah, yeah, but come on, Ali. I told you, if there's anything wrong, we can get your purchase price lowered, or get you credited at closing. (SIGHS) Ali. Come on, man, let me tell you something. These inspections, man, they cost like $250 and up! Did you know that? Yes, I know that. And that's why I told you. Otherwise, you end up in your situation, knee deep in shit. You got that right! Look, man, my wife's coming through this door in about five minutes, and when this smell hits her, she's gonna hit me in the back of the head. You understand? I'm dead. You hear me? Look, Michael, I got someone that's pretty good and cheap. Let me e-mail him and I'll hit you back. Okay, now, cheap, Ali, that's what I'm looking for. A little bit of help. All right? Can you handle that? Get me a deal, bro, please. Get me a deal. No worries. All right, I'll be plungering. I'm gonna have toilet water all in my eyes, ears and... Oh! Oh, damn! Can you hear me? Not the phone! I'm telling you, Joel, never do business with friends. Never. Who are you talking about? Michael. Oh, man, that's... Except for me, because not only am I your friend, I'm your best friend. Yeah, but with your jacked up credit, there's nothing to worry about. Whatever, man. Look, apartments for life. Shall we play chess? All right, man. I only got about an hour, man. I gotta be at the club at 7:00. You coming through tonight? Yeah, we'll be there about 8:00. You and wifey? Wifey? (IN JAMAICAN ACCENT) Easy, selector, hold tight. I'm saying, man, y'all been going strong. It's been like a couple of weeks now, right? Yeah, but Angela's not feeling it. She texted me five times today. Hmm, that's why she's the side chick, you know. But, what's up with Sandrine? I mean, you catching feelings? I wouldn't say all that. I'm just giving her a good look. A good look, huh? (LAUGHS) (JUNIOR CRYING) Okay, Junior, please stop crying. Mommy's coming. (CELL PHONE VIBRATES) Girl, where you at? having a tantrum and I'm trying to study. All right, pops, don't let that young one get away! Come on, she's not that young. Oh, what? She was in the second grade when we were seniors. Whatever. All right, man. Get your ass locked up, man. That girl is borderline jailbait, yo. You act like she's 12! You met her kid yet? No. You hit it yet? No. You mow the lawn? No. Okay. You all right? Yeah, like I said. I am just giving her a good look. Any tongue yet? Yes! Now, can we please play? All right. All right. JOEL: All right, man. You ever saw that show To Catch a Pervert? (BOTH LAUGHING) JOEL: Yo, don't you hate it when your best friend falls in love and then he gives you, lik, "the best friend time out"? (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Best friends are like a married couple, you know what am saying? It's like... You be like, "Hey, man, I'm not been feeling good about "our situation, so I wanna talk. "We haven't been playing chess like we used to. "Like, I call you, it takes you a minute to call me back, "like what's going on, where are we "where are we at in our relationship? "It's ridiculous." I love Roscoe's. Yeah, you know. Gotta love the Roscoe's, right? Yeah, well, hold it good, so it doesn't spill out. You know what? Joel is gonna kill me for missing the show tonight.

Well, that sound like a power move, man. Why don't you come on down to Giggles and, you know, we'll drink to it. (CELL PHONE BEEPS) Hold on a second. All right. Hey, sweetie. Hold on. Hold on. that's Sandrine. I'm gonna hit you back. All right, man. I'm going to finish what I'm doing, get dressed and head down to Giggles, man. I'll just holler at you tomorrow. Okay, cool. Have a good show. All right, bro. Hey, what's up, sweetie? I'm good. How are you? Yeah. Yeah. I'm cool. Okay. You've been somewhat distant lately. Yeah. I'm sorry. I... I couldn't sleep the other night. Sorry. Anything you want to talk about? No. Just... Dealing with work. Okay. Well, maybe I can cheer you up. What are you doing tomorrow night? Tomorrow... I'm going to this real estate marketing seminar, down by LAX. All right. So, if you are not too tired after that, maybe I can swing by. Well, let me see. We might go get drinks afterwards, but I'll give you a call, okay? Okay. All right. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Bye. There is a God, bro. Whoa, whoa. You got the number? Did I? Melody just came to my show to see me. And you are asking me, "Did I get the number?" Okay. Let me rephrase that. Are you going to call her? Call her? I'm heading over there to see her tonight, man. What? You know how I do. How long is a seminar thing, anyway? It's about to be 12:00, Sandy. He said they might go out for drinks after. Call again. Okay. Look at you. Couldn't wait. Still going to voicemail. Look. I say go over there in your birthday suit and get it popping. I thought of that. I would. But his phone is off. Honey, if he is as stressed as you are making it seem like what you doing all right now. If I was you, I'd go over there buck naked and I bet you that'll put a smile on his face. You're right. I know. Besides, what's better than drunk sex? All right, then. So, on that point. Go, call him. Thank you. SANDRINE: Okay, I'll call you tomorrow. I know, okay. Oh, shit! (TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Hey, baby, what's going on? Where's the whipped cream? (WHISPERING) What are you doing? Go! Go get dressed. My girlfriend's here. (WHISPERING) Girlfriend? Oh! Hell no! Bring her in. Go. Bring her in. Go get dressed. Bring her in! (MOUTHING) I'm not getting dressed. I want to meet this bitch. Now? What are you doing? Open the damn door! Maybe not. Ali! (BANGING ON DOOR) Ali! Girl, he's not even coming to the door. This is silly. It was a bad idea. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Oh! Look who's home. Wow. Remember, I told you the door was broken last week. Sounds like such a coincidence. I know, but... But, what? I've been calling you for the last three hours. Your phone is going straight to voicemail. My battery died. I called you as soon as I got home. And then what about the time when you left my apartment early. Now I'm wondering, where'd you go? I went home. Wow. Wow. You know I came here thinking we were going to get somewhere tonight. I should have stayed home. Wait. What? What do you want me to do? You want me to what, make something up? No. You are doing a really good job of that, right now. Thought I was the young one in the relationship. What are you doing? The door's broke, remember? I don't need those. Sandrine! I miss you when you with me, girl. Things are going really good at work. Yeah. We're getting along now. Thank goodness. That's good. I'm gonna finish cooking this food for you. You are the best husband. What did you say? I said you are the best. Say it again. You are the best husband. Oh, honey. You know what? I told the girls that we were going shopping and I am late. Let's see what time it is. Yeah. Actually, we're supposed to be there right now. I'll be back in a couple of hours, okay? Hurry up and come on back. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Oh, you want me to get that? Oh, no. I got it. It ain't nobody but Ali. Hey, yo! Come on in, boss. (DOOR OPENS) What's up, champ? I'm good. I'm good. Have a seat, man. What's up with those burners? Man, about to get my Chef Boyardee on. Hey, Ali. Hey, Jackie. How are you? I'm good. How's Sandrine? She's okay. Good. Okay, honey. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Okay. Be good. Hurry back. I love you. I love you, too. Don't sell that kind of chocolate no more, boy. Hey, I got something for you. What's up? This. It's the ass porn. Ebony porn. Miscellaneous. Now, I know you don't do porn. I know this. But do whatever you want to with this, man. I don't care. eBay, Craigslist, man. You can get a lot of money for this shit on the streets. Just get it out of here, man. Like, I'm done. Wait. Wait. What happened? Man. Let's just say, I had a wake-up call last night. I mean, it's about to be a new year. No more porno for me, man. Whoa. So... Melody... Nothing happened? So she invited me to the set, man, where she was filming. Long story short, man, things got hot and heavy. I'm kind of confused, right. I don't understand. What do you want me to do in this scene? Bitch, I need you to emote. Emote. Emote. Emote. Yeah. Can you do that? Miss Juggs, I have a Joel Long here to see you. Yes. What's up, man? Follow me, babe. Okay. All right, dog. What's up, man? Thanks, man. Good work. Thank you. Thank you. Good work on you. What is that? You using the penis pump? No. Oh. Sorry, love, I had to change real quick. (SENSUAL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) You know, I was, ahem, real surprised to see you at my show yesterday. Yeah, my girlfriend went a few weeks ago. She said that the show was really great and the host was really cute. (STAMMERING) I was just... Yo, I was hosting. Well, you tell your girlfriend, that, you know, drinks are on me next week. Well, looks like I know my lines. I bet, it's, um, real hard for you to, um... (STAMMERING) ...to memorize all them lines, huh? Well, it is. But, I studied Shakespeare. Damn, Melody. They even bigger than they is on the video! Oh, you've seen my movie? Oh? What? I mean, come on, I don't, you know... You know, like maybe once or twice. That's it? Yeah. Seven, 18. (MUFFLED TALKING) MELODY: Oh, baby. JOEL: Huh? Baby? Baby? You all right? JOEL: Huh? You act like you've seen a ghost. No, no, no, no. It's just that I keep... Damn. I couldn't do it, man. All I kept thinking about was Jackie, man. I kept these images popping in my head like, it was her like playing the harp, man. It was crazy! So... Yeah. So, nothing? No. But, it ain't what you think though. 'Cause... You ever tried Viagra? No. No. I'm fine. I'm good. You know what I'm saying. I just, um... I got to be honest. I keep... Keep thinking, uh, about my wife. Right. Yeah. No. I mean, it has nothing to do with you. You... I know. It's cool. You've never been with a celebrity before. It's cool. Yeah. Okay. That's... That's all right. You know what, I gotta... I gotta go. So? Y'all didn't... Nothing? Well, I did have them jugs in my face. I did do that. But that's it, man. Yo, and I felt so relieved when I left. And I know I say this all the time, man, but I love my wife. Wow. Well, I might need a couple of these pornos, bro. What? Yeah, Sandrine broke up with me last night. Which... What happened? She came by when I had this chick, Becky, over. Becky? Yeah, you don't know her. I met her at the 7-Eleven. So what? What, you got caught? Not technically. I wouldn't let her in. Like I kept the top bolt locked and... You kept the top bolt locked? What are you... (SIGHS) She did a pop-up. I told you about the pop-up, man! (SIGHS) I know. So, what happened next? (SIGHS) Well, after I got Becky out of there I called her, she came over and... I tried to talk to her, but she wasn't having it. Of course not, man. She's young, not dumb. You know what, though, man, I've been thinking... (SIGHS) I'm just tired of playing house. The baby daddy... Ms. Prick stressing me out at work. I mean... Yo, I just need a break, man. I'm sorry, man. I mean, you good? You all right? Yeah, yeah. I'm... I'm cool, man. Look... Let's... Get some burgers over there... Come on, man. Yeah. ALI: There's no place like home.

I'm... I'm so sorry I'm late. The 405, sir. Traffic and... Shh. No reason to apologize to me, Mr. Reese. You had 30 minutes of my time. Then you made the conscious decision to waste 24 of those. So, now you got six minutes left. Six minutes? Yeah, six minutes. Six minutes, like... Six minutes, Doug E. Fresh, you're on? Ah, ah, on. What? On. Mr. Reese. (RATTLING) Hey. Are you okay? Uh...

(CHUCKLES) Okay, okay, okay. out of the last four and a half minutes that you actually have here. Your proposal points out how African-American... (ROARS) ...capitalizing on this mortgage crisis that we're in. With 80% being African-American females. My beautiful black woman. What are you saying? That you would target that market more exclusively. Sandrine. Come again? The snoring, pop-ups, Junior. Why did I even mess with that? Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Mr. Reese, what the fuck are you talking about? Are you here with me? Come on, what are you saying? Spit it out. I just miss her so much. I... Right. Okay, we're done here. Thank you very much. I don't have time for this. Whoa! Wait. No, Mr. Johnson, uh... Mr. Johnson, you gotta believe... I love her. Oh, really? Well, you wanna know what I believe? I really believe that you can find your own way out to the goddamn exit. Have a good day, sir. Wait. No... I mean... Mr. Johnson, I'm... I'm serious. It's so sincere. Sleeping pills and Henny? (LAUGHS) I thought it was a glass of water. No wonder your ass was bugging out, man. Thanks a lot, bro. Hey, that's what I'm here for. Now get up, bro. Life goes on. Life sucks. Well, I'm sorry it took you first broken heart, man. But, you ain't no different than the rest of us, man. We've all had that feeling. How did you handle it? Cried like a baby and beat off. Beating off is your answer to everything. Yeah. That's what I've been trying to tell you. It's the key to life, man. You need to start trying it. (SIGHS) I want her back. You not gonna start crying on me, is you? Well, I miss her though. Even little things, huh? Yeah, I've been there, man. Well, how do I get her back? Man, if you really wanna get her back, man, I'll help you. But I mean, you gonna have to shoot straight with her, man. No more games. No games? What are you, on her side now? No, man. I'm just trying to keep it real with you. Oh, okay. So, now that you're porno-free, you getting all holier-than-thou on me. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, man. I'm here trying to help you, man. That was a pivotal moment in my life! My bad. You're right. You're right. I'm just saying, man. She's a good girl. And they don't come around that often. (CLUB MUSIC PLAYING) What's wrong? Ali? Come on, Sandy. Look, you got Junior, you got school. You got way too much to deal with. You got your mom. And like honestly, for him to be the older one, he's not showing it. At all. And it's unfair. I know. I just trusted him and I... Yeah, I get that. I get that. We all trusted someone at one time but at the end of the day he's lost. Oh, well. Move on. You don't have time for his games. Oh, we are late. Look, what we gonna do... We going to drink up, and have a good time. By a round of applause, how many beaters we got in the building? Take it from me. If you want a happy home, become one with your right hand. You don't need help. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) You don't need Oprah, you don't need Dr. Phil, you don't need a therapi. Just get your beat on. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) I'm drawing a flower. You know they say you always know. You knew daddy was the one? When we first met. (CHUCKLES) It was that easy, Mom? No, it's never that easy. That's what I thought. (MIMICS) When we first met. Yeah, well. Hey, hey... But you know, your father, God bless his soul, when we first started dating, he got on my last nerve. Oh... He did? Oh... But he had potential. You know? We just had to kind of like smooth out some of those rough edges. You smoothed them out. (LAUGHS) Indeed I did. Indeed I did. Yes. Yes. But he was a good man. Ali's been calling me and texting. I just haven't... I don't know... You not ready to talk to him? Not yet. Well, in your time. But just remember, sometimes you don't know what you have, until it's gone. Special delivery. What are you doing here? Well, I was paid top dollar to personally see to it that you receive these, courtesy of my best friend. Thank you. He misses you, Sandrine. Specially like your snoring, your cold feet, your eye boogers, the way you snort. (LAUGHS) No, I'm just... Really, though. You take care, all right? Thanks. You, too. ALI: Hey, Sandrine. I want you to know that I miss you so much. These last few weeks have been like no other. I wish I could rewind the time just to save you from the hurt I caused you. And it's killing me, sweetie. It's killing me knowing tht I caused you the pain that I want to ask you something that I don't deserve. A second chance. Love you always. Ali. I just want to feel that I can trust you, Ali. I understand. Completely. You know what my mom said? What? She said that we remind her of them. Really? Her and your dad? Yeah. Wow. That's deep. I know. Makes me feel real good. I mean... I'm just so glad you're here. Me too. I missed you. ALI: After that horrible meeting with James Johnson, I'm just not sure this is the career I can retire from. Why not? I mean, the market is so unstable right now. Unless you're the boss, you got no control. So, there is no reward without the risk? Got it. But I thought settling wasn't in your vocabulary? You have such a good memory. Look, I don't know much about real estate. Okay. I just know that there's plenty of it. Buying, selling, building. That's never gonna stop, you'll be good. Yes, you're right. And that's why I wanna start my own agency. I know I would succeed. Dope. What's stopping you? Money, advertising, marketing. With that alone you're talking a couple of thousand dollars. To be on commercials? No, no. That's too expensive. You know those real estate ads you see... The people on the shopping carts. Yeah, in the grocery store. Well, that's what I'd be paying for. That exposure would pretty much expose me to a wide range of buyers and sellers. I mean... I wanna help you. Yeah? Yeah. How? Financially. I can co-sign a loan for you. Are you serious? (LAUGHS) Yes. Baby, I believe in you. There's no guarantees with this, Sandrine. I know that. Did you mean what you wrote in that letter? Yes. Of course I did. Can you guarantee it? Wow. You... You're incredible. Yes. Thank you, baby. You know, plus me and Junior, we like traveling, fine dining and all of the above, okay? We are gonna need to make sure that you can provide these things. I won't let you down. I love you. I love you more. You're not gonna be looking all corny and stuff? You're not going to be like... (LAUGHS) You know, making those funny faces and stuff. Oh, you got jokes. I don't do corny. No, you don't. I know you don't. This is going to be good. A loan for 5 grand? Yeah. Yes, sir. I got a photo shoot in a couple of days. So what? Like, your picture gonna be on shopping carts and stuff? Yeah, LA Times. Bus benches. Please, bro. No cornball poses, man. Don't embarrass us. You sound like Sandrine now. Listen, don't be surprised if Ebony or Upscale come calling me. Well, if they do, you be sure to remember that lady of yours, man. You got you a winner, Ali. Trust me. I'm well aware of that. So much so, I'm about to step it up. Talk to me. I might need a best man. Are you available? What? Yeah, her birthday is next month. Gonna pop the question. Oh! That's what I'm talking about, man. You about to be sounding like me, huh? What? You know. BOTH: I love my wife. Man, I'm proud of you, man. (CELL PHONE VIBRATES) Thank you, bro. Uh, that's her now. Time to check in? Welcome to the club, bro. (LAUGHS) She went in for a physical exam the doctor felt a lump in her breast and now she's gotta get a biopsy. What? I don't... I don't know what I'll do if my mother has cancer. Don't think that way. I can't help but think that way. I will go crazy if something happens to my mother. I understand but... How can you understand? Your mother's fine. And your mom's going to be fine, too. I don't know. (SIGHS) Come here. (SIGHS) Dear Heavenly Father, we humbly ask you to shine a ray of blessings on a very special lady. One who not only is a great mother, but one who lives a righteous path that you laid. In Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen. Thanks. I'm here for you. I know. Sorry for snapping on you. It's okay, I understand. Good. Because until my mother gets a clean bill of health I'm not going to be much fun to be around. I understand. All right. I'm gonna go. No. I don't want you to leave tonight. Okay. Okay. What's on TV? Oh, good. There you go. You're in the middle of a threesome. That's it. Right there. Yeah, man. Just imagine she's rubbing on your head. One rubbing your back. That's how you do it. Right motivation, man. Nice. You getting this, dude? Huh? You getting this, man? Yeah. All right, then get it then, man. This is all we got. (CAMERA CLICKING) Well, help me out then, bro. Since you the man. Right now? Yes, please. Gotta fix your thing tight. Look at me, like... (CAMERA CLICKING) Thank you. It's gonna turn out, man. I'm just playing with you. Yo. I wanna be there when you pick out your photo. So what? You have no faith in me? You will thank me in the long run. Trust me, bro. You got jokes. I hope so, man. I'm a comedian. Oh, man. Time to reload, man. Some more of that. Yeah, to the game then. All right, cool, man. But, you should be setting up, 'cause I won last time. Yeah, I don't remember that, but okay. "I love you." Is this from Juliet, Romeo? Yeah, she left that on the table this morning. How's her mom doing? She's going in for her biopsy results today. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey. Hey. You thirsty? No, thanks. What's wrong? They admitted my mom. She has metastatic breast cancer. Mata... What is that? A malignant tumor. Started in her breasts. Now, it's taking over her kidney. I don't know. She, she has to undergo a surgery immediately. She didn't even have any symptoms. Nothing. Nothing. Just like that? It just came out of nowhere? A year ago, she was complaining about pain in her breasts. The doctor diagnosed it as stress related. Stress related? He gave her a prescription. She said she felt better. We thought everything would be okay. This is just happening so damn fast. Listen, whatever you need from me, I'm there for you, okay? Whatever. Okay? I know. Just wanted to tell you. I gotta go get Junior from Steph's. I'm late. Hey. I wanna go with you to the hospital tomorrow, all right? Okay. I love you. Bye. (JUNIOR GROWLING) (CELL PHONE VIBRATES) Hey, sweetie, calling you again. Just checking on you and your mom. Never heard back from you today so I'll just swing by tomorrow on my way home. I stay up late Waiting on you Can't go to sleep And I'm not sure what to do I check my phone Time and time again Are you with your friend?

Just leaving you a message. Give me a ring back, all right? Talk to you later, bye. All right, Junior's in there counting sheeps. Thanks. Who was that? Ali? Yup. Sandy, you really need to talk to him. I know. Seriously. I know. When? When... I will. So have you heard from her? I haven't heard anything from her. She probably needs some time alone. That's all, man. I can understand that but, let me know something. She's just stressed out, man. It'll pass. Let's do this. Hey. Hey, Sandrine. Hey. You think you could swing by here tomorrow around 3:00? Yeah, okay. Okay. Bye. Well, the surgery was a success. Now she just has to undergo an intensive chemotherapy. So the outlook is positive, right? If she... If she responds well to the chemo and goes into remission, yes. If not, they're giving her six months. Six months? She's gonna respond. I know she will. I pray she does. I've been so worried about you. I know. I'm sorry, I've been meaning to return your calls. I just got a lot on my mind. I've been thinking about us. Us? Okay. I'm not sure what to do right now. What to do? What are you talking about? About us. About my family. I'm here for you and your family. It's not one or the other. This isn't easy for me, Ali. Okay? I just don't think I can give us all of me right now. Listen. You just can't turn things off and on when something bad happens in your life. You really don't understand. I understand, if something tragic happens to me and my family, I expect my lady to be there for me, just like I'd be there for her. Yeah but, it hasn't happened to you, babe! It happened to me and my family. Okay? I'm dealing with this the only way I know how. By ignoring me? Not answering my phone calls? I mean, now you hit me with the, "We need to talk"? Okay. I just need to be alone. Alone? You're breaking up with me? I'm sorry, Ali. I'm sorry. Things have changed and I'm... What has changed from the note you left at my apartment? I mean, what? A lot. I do love you and I meant what I wrote. It's just that right now... It just doesn't make any sense, Sandrine. I'm trying to be here. I'm trying to be here for you and your family. Ali.

I don't have anything for you right now. I'm sorry. Baby, I'm so sorry. Okay. Where are you going? Good bye, Sandrine. You're leaving? I'll never leave you. (SOBBING) (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) I've gotta tell you, Mr. Reese, when my secretary presented your sales report, I couldn't believe the numbers. Well, I wasn't in my right state of mind the first time we first met. Shit, you're damn right about that. You know you were about six minutes from getting your ass bounced out of there by security. Well, I'm glad you didn't. That would not have been a good look. Well, take a look. As you can see, we're almost done with Community Gardens. And in about six months we gonna need to get it sold.

Thank you. So how did you know I'd be here? (HORN HONKING) Make sure she gets home safe, partner. I figured I'd ask Joel to come help me out this time. I'm not trying to take up too much of your time. I know you're busy. No. Just... I want you to know that I really regret and I hate how things ended between us. You were going through a lot and it was hard for you. I was... I was selfish. No. No, you were trying to be there for me. I ran away. And I'm sorry. You were the best thing that happened to me in a really, really long time. Just, I'm just realizing that now. You know my mother used to say, "You never know what you got till it's gone." I didn't really appreciate those words then, you know. How is she? How's she doing? She passed away. Oh, God. I'm so sorry. That's okay. She was... She was in a lot of pain, you know? She's in a better place. Yeah. She is. She thought highly of you. I'm just glad she gave you the okay. Yeah, me too. How's Junior? He's good. Junior's good. He's dealing with this, you know.
