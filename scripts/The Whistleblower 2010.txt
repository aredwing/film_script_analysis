Yes. - Hey boys. - Hey Hey, why don't you guys go inside, and your mom, Okey? All right? Marie asked me to bring this. Erin around? It's nice to see you too, Kath. Yes, right. You can't hold this against me. I gave you plenty of warning on this. It's not my fault you're married to that job of yours. You just sprung this on me, what... look, I'm not going to do this in front of Erin, okay. Where is she? Erin? And actually I'm not married to my job. I happen to like it. I don't see why that has to make me a bad mother. Well, it's not my fault the judge didn't see it that way, Kath. Thanks, Kyle, thank you for bringing that up. Look, I told you, you're welcome to come down to Dalton It's really simple for me, you know, I've just got to clear my mortgage, find a transfer, you know, really a piece of cake. Hey, sweetie. How's it going? Come here. Oh. - Come here. - No, Kyle, it's fragile. - How am I supposed to know? - Hi, Marie. How's it going? I brought the camping gear. Thank you. - Why don't you label them... - Marie scares me. I'll tell you a secret. She scares me too. Don't tell anyone. You okay? Uh huh. Tell me. When are you coming? Sweetie, I'm having a really hard time finding a transfer. It might take awhile. But I'm trying really hard. Okay, I'm going to make it happen, okay? I don't understand. There's got to be something. I mean, I have the experience, - Kathy! - I took extra forensic courses. Kathy! You've done everything right. This is just how the cards fell. Yeah, story of my fucking life. Look, there's something I heard about. Yeah. This is just how the cards fell. What with you trying to get closer to your kid. It's incredible money. A hundred grand tax-free for six months' work. Come on. Is it legal? What is this? It's the contractor that the government uses to provide peacekeepers in Bosnia. Bosnia. You see the bullet marks? Eye level! You come here today as a beacon of hope. As representatives of our highest aspirations. You've been hired by Democra Security to represent the US as monitors for the United Nations. In the next few months you will protect the rule of law where lawlessness is run rampant. The 1995 Dayton Peace Accords ended this war dictating that an international police task force... ...you, would smooth the transition from war to peace. During your training you will see that peace is harder won than war. That every morning's hope is haunted by yesterday's nightmare. As representatives of the United Nations, we stake our highest values, even our lives... ...on the belief that we can rebuild. We must renew and we will witness the rebirth of this country. It'll settle down. - You been here before? - This is my second mission. You came straight from the Academy? No, I'm not a cop. I work in administration. You only need a... ...high school diploma and to be over 21 to get in. Oh. What about you? What brought you here? Oh, I heard the food was really great. I thought the war was over. De-mining. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm great. I'm serious, I'm serious. He couldn't move off the mine for eight days and eight nights. So he's demanding time and a half for nights. Best part is that now sue me! How about that? You still seeing the... the little guy? Kathy, meet Fred Murray. - Hi. - Pleasure. Hey, guys. We got a match. High stakes tournament situation. US versus Holland. Come on, let's go. - Yes! - Come on, Come on, yes! You suck at pinball and you suck at football. Who do you think invented pinball? - Can you play? - Can I play Hold this. Okay... okay. Alright. She's having the last one. The last one. You know what? You got to pull it. Alright. Yeah, she knows, okay, she knows. Okay, come on, come on. Damn it! Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! Shit! Sorry, guys. - I Don't know what happened. - Who's not going to buy the drinks? I don't know what happened there. I would love some whisky and... Don't use... Oh shit! Sorry, you can't you can't use both flippers at the same time, otherwise Flippers? Yeah, these are called flippers. Well, this is the way I was taught. - With a man behind you? - Girls. Bam, bam, because it has to bounce off. This move still get you laid? Well, in Holland it does. I'm really out of practice. Gentlemen. So where do we sign to say we came? You sign... Well... well, I think you have to sign at the end of the session. No. Why? No, no, no, no. Yep, yep, it says right here, "UN mandate requires you to sign at the end" Yes, but this paper is no good. - The new policy is... - Leave her alone. They try it out with everyone. You sign them in, they bugger off. - I'm McVeigh. You're Kathy? Yeah? - Yeah. Welcome to paradise. Follow me. Okay, gentlemen. If you've nothing better to do today I would like you to start investigating two new stabbings. Four new shootings... and a wee man with a broken leg who can barely remember his name. First one. In here. Gather around. Kathy, why don't you take this, please? Facial contusions from repeated beatings with fist. Lacerations on the eye caused by the edge of an iron. Left arm was the first entry point of a large kitchen knife. Okay Mama, I'm just going to lift this up. It's all right, it's okay. Who did this? Looks like the husband. Okay, that's the case. Who's taking it and what's their first step? I will take it. Very good. All right. All right. All right. Calm down. Calm down. What did he say? Say woman is Muslim and she deserved it. That's enough. Stop it! Hands off. Moving on. Next case. Go. Everyone outside. Kathy, you too. Excuse me, Excuse me. What do you mean moving on? Who's going to investigate and make an arrest? - This is a felony assault. - Okay, let me ask you something. Can you tell a Serb from a Croat or a Bosniak? Because I can. Racial hatred started a war in this country. And as much as I'd like to be, we aren't here as investigators, we monitor. That's it. Sometimes stepping back is part of the job. Zlata has been in the hospital eight times because of her husband. Each time she tried to make complaint, my bosses send her home. They laugh at her. They laugh at women in Bosnia. They laughed at my mother even. And they do not prosecute domestic violence. Yesterday you wanted to help. Now you can show me how to do this. So this is the hospital report. You have no police reports. Well, what you need to do is you need to investigate this as if it were a felony assault. So if you go back to the hospital and then you get every single doctor who treated her to testify... well, then you might have a chance. - Oh hello. - Hello. Don't mind him. He's a complete wimp. Well, you've been stirring things up. Ms. Rees, if I over-stepped protocol with the Zlata Sehick case I'm... Would you call me Madeleine? You've just done in two months what we failed to do in four years. Sit down. - Want some tea? - Yes, please. Viko Mezovic did a great job, but you've just facilitated the first conviction for domestic violence since the end of the war in Bosnia. Well, it was very basic... Thank you. Thank you... basic police work. It's just my job. You can't imagine how that makes you stand out around here. The IPTF have a Gender Affairs Office here. And the current head left and I think you're the right person to take over. Well... Are you up for it? Hello. Hi, Sweetie. Did you get the stuff I sent? - Did Dad say you're not coming back? - No. Of course I'm coming back. - Are you sure? - Yes. - For Labour Day? - Well, I... 'Cause my friends are renting a boat and But I have to stay longer because they've asked me to be the head of a department. Oh, well You know what? I'm making a lot of money, so I can move nearer Dad ...and I can see you all the time. - That's cool. Hold on! Sorry, I got to go, Mom. - I have a game. - Okay. - I love you. Bye. - Bye. - Kathy? - Yes. Nick. Kaufman. Contingent Commander. - Good to meet you. - Good to meet you. - How are you? - Can I give you a hand? - I'm fine. I'm fine. This way? - Yeah. Good having another American in the mix. Some people get pissed off, saying we're taking over. Makes my life easier. Especially when it's a good-looking woman reporting to me. Oh, I don't mean to burst your bubble but I report to Madeleine Rees. It's a joint appointment. And she's Human Rights. But you're Democra. So ultimately you're all mine at the end of the day. No you can't. Don't. Please don't. No. Just don't touch. Just step away from the table, please. I've had my eyes on this table for a long time. This one is mine, lady. - Oh, this is your table? - This is mine table... my table. I'm sorry to tell you but this is my table. I have a new job over at HQ with a lot of fancy diplomats and... for someone in my position ...would have this table? - This... Yes. Yes. I feel very strongly about it. You don't care about my feelings? I don't care about your feelings. So you're just going to take it? I'll tell you what. If you buy me dinner you can have the damn table. - Come on! - Okay, let's go. I was married twice. - Like, two times? - Two times. That's twice. Yes, once and then... and then again and I messed it up both times. What about you? Well, technically I'm still married. But it is... it's complicated right now because we are in the middle of what I would call an ending But you're married. - Right. But we are in the process of - Kids? Yeah, we have two ...boys. It isn't that complicated but it is. If I slept with you, I'm going straight to hell. You are. Let's get drunk first. Goat fuck! Musical apartments! - Just hold the people back! - What do you need me to do? The Muslim women are supposed to get their old apartments back. Serbs took them during the war. Serbs don't want to leave. And a lot of places got sold to third-party Croats or God knows what! And everyone's pissed. And I figured it's a bunch of widows, so your Gender Office can handle it, huh? - Okay, okay, okay. - Bolkovac? - Bolkovac? - Yes. They need you. Come on. - Murray, can you deal with it? - I'll take this then. She was talking but I couldn't understand. She's not local. Hey. Hey. All right. All right. All right. I'm not going to touch you. I won't touch you. What is it? Are you in pain? This girl is seriously ill. Could you call a medic? Somebody call an ambulance! They make raid! - They abuse the girls. - Okay. Calm down. Take a breath. Take a breath. Nine girls there. Nine girls there. - Help them! - Where? Where? - Florida Bar. - Florida Bar. - What is that? What is Florida Bar? - It's one of the bars in the hills. Look, I can take them to the Zenica Shelter. That's where we usually take these girls. Usually!? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Where is the bar? How do I get there? What's happening here? What's going on here? IPTF told us to come. Oh really? That's interesting. Since when do you listen to us? Well, where are they? I don't see any monitors. Lady, what do you want? I got called to come here to take the girls to Zenica so I'm here. What's Zenica? What is it? Mothersuckers. I don't pay you fucking Smurfs no more. Pay? Pay? What's he talking about? What does he mean, pay? What did he say? What did he say? I don't know. I am Bosniak and he is Croat and I don't understand Croat! Bullshit! I know you understand him. Smart lady. What's in Zenica? It's a woman's shelter. You know, the whores get a good meal. They can talk about problems. It's like a vacation for them. Very funny. Oh my God. Quickly! Over here. - Is this the Zenica Shelter? - Yes. We have to be careful. - Sometimes they watch. - Who watch? - Traffickers. - Traffickers? Yes. Human trafficking. These girls were abducted and sold. They are told they must work off their debt. And then they'll be let go. But they never are. Since the end of the war, sex trafficking has spread like cancer. Why since the end of the war? Half our men are dead. So... who are these girls brought in for? This is our volunteer nurse. She says Raya has bad infection. The nurse found objects inside her. Excuse me? Coins. Like you saw, they're not prostitutes. They are slaves, treated like dogs. Do you have a doctor here? We don't have doctor. Try the Global Displacement Agency. If they keep them or not, I don't know. Wait, please. There were other girls? The ones who were from the Florida Bar. The police brought them here about an hour ago. Here? No. No police came. Are you sure? These girls never arrived. I'm looking for Laura Levi, Annie. Okay. We'll see you later. Hi. I'm Kathy Bolkovac. I'm the new Head of Gender Affairs. I heard. Congratulations. I'm Laura Levi. What nationalities are we dealing with here? Oh I presume these two women want to be repatriated? I don't know. Them here because they need medical attention. We'll get them to the medical centre. As soon as we get clearance, we'll know where we stand. Clearance? What does that mean? Look, I'll do whatever I can to help, but I have to determine if they'll cooperate with their repatriation program. That's the only way I can let them stay here. It's not me, it's policy. I see, policy. Oh, one more thing I just wanted to ask you. The other girls from the raid were supposed to go to the Zenica Shelter, but they never arrived. Really? Why don't you check the IPTF message boards? Listen, half the time these raids are for show. I'm sure the owner has paid off whoever he had to by now. Your missing girls are probably back at the bar. Excuse me now. Hey, Murray, mind if I join you? Yeah, have a seat. - Not eating? - No, I just have a quick question. You know the raid you ordered last night? Local police said they were taking the girls to Zenica but they never showed up. Fucking mess! It's the locals dragging us into their turf war. Some cop from another canton calls in a fake tip about a prostitution bust. But the bar is legit and the girls just waitresses. So... Waitresses? Hey, doesn't hurt to be thorough though, right? Yeah, right. Thing is I found padlocked rooms, young women's passports ...and there was a lot of US currency - Where are we going, Columbo? I don't know, but something fucked up's going on. Honey, it's like I say, this is Bosnia. These people specialize in fucked up. And speaking of, we've got another re-housing goatfuck in Gorazde so ...catch you later, Kath. - See you later, guys. Should have seen this place. There were pictures all over the walls of guys with those girls. And almost every single guy in there is ours. I saw one of your guys there. - You saw one of my guys there? - Yeah. He was wearing your flag. You want to ask me something? I guess I do. Okay listen... I've heard about these places. I know they exist. I know my guys go up there once in awhile. I figured for strippers or sex. I don't know, I haven't been there. I know nothing about any girls being locked up. What the fuck? Okey. I'm sorry. At home... ...I worked in a precinct where there were 25 guys. And I knew them really well, I knew every one of them. I know their families. I know everything about them and I trust them completely. I was dumb enough to think I'd be joining some elite police officers here. But I don't know who these people are. Three, two, one... ...clear. - Kaufman! - Is it okay for me to be here? - Sure. Just wait there. What's up? You finally come and see me in action. I live to see you in action. This is for you. I think Fred Murray's taking payoffs from brothels. And it's not prostitution. The girls were trafficked. The problem is, who investigates, how to charge him? All the international personnel have immunity. They can't be prosecuted. But this is good work, Bolkavac. I think it might even deserve a dinner out with yours truly. Don't think I've earned that. Hey girls, how are you doing? Did you get some rest? I went to the Florida Bar... ...and I saw the room in the back and I know what's been happening to you. Good for you. Can we go now? What happened to the girls? Did you see my friend Luba? Is she safe? No. The police took the girls back to the bar. But we can still help your friend. I believe the bar was raided because... Tanjo, the owner was refusing to pay this man money. Is that true? I know you're scared to talk but... ...if you can tell me that this is the man ...then - Then what? You put him in jail? No, he has diplomatic immunity. That means he's protected by the UN. But Tanjo can go to jail. He can go to jail. And if you both say in a court... ...that Tanjo has been taking payoffs from this man... ...then his name will go on record... ...and the UN has to do something. They can't knowingly have one of their men involved in rape, kidnapping and torture. How do you do this if you work for the UN? I'm an American police officer. It doesn't matter who I work for, I wouldn't let anybody get away with this. So if we go to court you promise you can stop these men? I can't promise I can stop all these men. - I promise - If you cannot promise then why do we agree? There is too much danger to go speak in a court, even this, to say anything to you. How do I know this is safe? You're a smart girl. I have a daughter. She was taken away from me and I can't change that. But maybe I can change what happens to you. Will we be safe? Yes. Do you promise? I promise. You need an armoured security vehicle for two teenage girls? What the hell did they do? None of your business. Okay, well, it's tough today. They sent most of our convoy up to Tesla. - Found some war criminal. - Shit! I can push for end of the week. Never mind. Don't worry about it. But I'll put it through. You never know, right? Is Viko around? Viko, your girlfriend is here. Come on, let's go. The van just sits here. It's no problem. It is not armoured like you want but it's heavy like tank. So it's okay. They don't build them like this. So we go straight to the safe house. Here's the address. After they make statement in court, yes? I made the call, so it's okay. Where is Irka? I need to have a word with you. Okay. Hey, Raya. There was a problem. During repatriation procedures we realized Irka had no passport. Okay, so we get her one. - Where is she? - You don't understand. She was trafficked from Grozny. Her parents were killed in Chechnya and she has no documentation. No embassy will recognize her. She's a girl without a country. Okay, you're not answering my question. Where is Irka? We handed her over to the police a few hours ago. How could you do that? Viko, take Raya. - So you meet us when you're done? - Yes, Yes - Raya, I'll see you soon, okay? - Let's go. It's okay. How could you do that? I couldn't keep her. She didn't have the paperwork. This is bullshit! Every case needs to be justified. I know what you think but it's an uninformed opinion. We have a system that works here. Really, for who? Sorry, I look for Laura Levinia? That's me. Hey. You know where they took her? The police take them to the border. Once they've crossed, there is one less trafficking victim in Bosnia. Take the 761 to Visegrad. Hey, I'm looking for a girl. The police dropped her here a few hours ago. Could you check the border logs? She's 15 years old, no passport. Okay, Okay. Lady, I know what you look for. Those girls do not go through border. They go through there. To Serbia, if they survive. Jesus. Irka! Leave me alone! Go home! Irka, please wait. You promised. Irka! Stop doing that! Please. Just let me die. I'm sorry. Irka, Irka, I'm sorry. No. It's okay. It's okay. Alright. It's okay. It will be over soon then you go home with your mother, okay? What happened? The car must have been following us. Do you know who they were? Nobody at my station knew where I was going. Did you tell anybody at IPTF? Madeleine, I need to see you. This is Peter Ward. Hello. Peter's an old friend, Internal Affairs. So, Kathy, have you had any report on Raya? None. Kathy, from now on I want you to run your investigation alongside Peter. The best way to find Raya is to continue your investigation into Fred Murray. You handed in a vehicle request to IPTF. Yes. Well, the traffickers obviously knew where you'd be, so there's a leak. I know that cops don't like to work with Internal Affairs... ...but considering what just happened, it's our only way. Well, I don't know how to move forward. I've lost two witnesses, Raya... and Irka won't testify now, she's too terrified. Do you think Fred Murray is only getting payoffs from one bar? No. So there could be other girls willing to testify against Fred Murray. It's possible. Well, if you can get any of these girls to testify in court then... ...well, there'd be something quite substantial to work with. Thank you. I don't want to put any of you in a dangerous... positionand ask you to speak out against your traffickers. I just want to know if you recognize this man. Maybe give them some time. I'll let you know if anyone says anything. Okay. Milena, would you show them this photograph, too? Just maybe someone has heard something about her. You look for this girl? She is okay? No. No, she's not. Do you know her? No. But I know him. He comes in the same group every month to take money from Ivan. - He came in a group? - Yes. I want to show you some photographs, some other photographs. If you could tell me if any of these people were in the group. That is Paolo. He liked pain. He liked weird things. He wanted me to like too This made my price go down. I know then, it will take me two more years to pay my debt. He buys girls for other men and puts them in apartments. Soldiers pay money to own girls for themselves. Check it out, three grand and she's all mine. Luc got one for 25 hundred. Turn around, let me see your ass. Take off your bra. When we come through checkpoint he drives the van. - What? - Him. He was the driver. This man drove you in a van across the border... ...into Bosnia? Yes. We stop at border. See man in blue like you. I thank God. I think we have our saviour. Then he jumps in and drives the van. Madeleine, they're bringing them in. IPTF are actually trafficking girls and bringing them across the border. And it's not just IPTF. This involves all kinds of internationals from military officers to diplomats. I thought I was only going after one guy. I had no idea what I'd be handing over. Get this off to Peter as quickly as you can. Are you sure you want to go ahead with this because... you know there'll be no going back after? Yes, ma'am. Right. Kathryn Bolkovac? Yes. - You're wanted in Human Resources. - Now? Yes, now. Sorry to keep you waiting there. No problem. - John Blakely. - Kathy Bolkovac. Nice to meet you. Have a seat. - So you keeping busy? - Yeah. Your superiors, they tell me that you're working hard. I enjoy my work. You're dedicated, thorough. Thank you. Tough stuff, though, your area. Stressful. Do you ever worry about burnout? No. Never. You must miss your daughter. It's unusual, isn't it, that a judge would award custody to the father? Id imagine there's almost some kind of a stigma around What did you want to talk to me about? I'm sorry. I just wondered. Because we award special paid leave to folks who work in stressful departments. You know, parents especially, we really encourage it. And you'd have some time to hang out with your daughter. Nice little jaunt around Europe, see the sights. I'm going to have to think about it. You're not the maternal type? Bitch. Who the fuck do you think you are? Go home before you get... We're watching you... You'd do better to shut your mouth, you fucking... Kathy, we need to meet. It's important. And be careful. Make sure you're not followed. Kathy, we need to meet. It's important. And be careful. Make sure you're not followed. The world and its mother knows about my investigation. I know. - Would you like something to drink? - No. - Do you mind if - Go ahead. Kathy, Internal Affairs is shutting down all your cases. Why? All of your files look like this. Jesus. I've been completely steam-rolled. They've sent Fred Murray home on some kind of leave. And top level military commanders are walking into my office and pulling your files. I've never seen I.A. Over-ridden like this before. Over-ridden by who? I don't know. I mean, I can't be sure. It's the State Department. Or Democra. You do know what they stand to lose if this I guess not. Their contract in Bosnia is worth millions. Globally, just this year alone, billions of dollars in US government contracts. And now you come along with this scandal I don't want a scandal. I'm just doing my job. I know, but it doesn't matter. Nobody cares about you. I'll get you the rest of your files back from I.A. You get them out of here, take them public. Or this will never see the light of day. I can't leave these girls. You're not helping them here. And, frankly, you're not safe to walk around. It's completely exposed you. Kathy, accidents do happen. A car blows a tire, a mine explodes. We don't have to report civilian deaths. I'll get you the rest of these... ...and you get yourself the hell out of here as soon as you can. Trust me. This is the right thing to do. I was so stupid. I mean, I thought I could work inside the system. Like I knew what I was doing. Like I knew how to play ball with all these fancy diplomats. I don't know. What would you do? I have to go home. My wife got a lawyer. I have to go home for the kids. I'm so sorry. But I'm worried about you. Don't be. I don't want... I don't want to leave you in the middle of all this. And... I don't want this to be the end. Please be careful. I want to take you home. Ivan!? Come. How much do you want me to pay for these girls, to take home? - You want to take them home? - Yes! It's ten times normal. It's three thousand each. Sorry, not this one, she's trouble. Thank you. I'm sorry, sir. So just this one? You bring the girl back, I give you the deposit back, ...okay? - Okay. Come on, I get to drink. Sign at the bottom, please. - Yes? - It's Viko. - I can't talk right now, Viko. - I think I know where Raya is. Okay. Ivan. We have a bit of a problem. What kind of problem? Where's the girl? All right. All right. All right. What did she say? Names of girls. Raya. Raya!? Raya! All right. All right. All right. Calm down, you're okay. - We go to Oasis? - Yes! And IPTF? Fuck protocol. We just raid the bar. Here. - You trust these guys? - Yes, I do. They're going to listen to you? Out! You sure? I do trust them. Let's go. Hello? We need to bring the owner out here. We arrest him outside. I don't want him threatening the girls. Go! Go! Go! Go! Okay, go! Go! We have a warrant to search these premises. Ivan Bladzic has been arrested for human trafficking. Get out of here. You don't have to be afraid of Ivan. He can't hurt you. We're going to get you somewhere safe and help get you home. Raya. Raya. Come on. These girls work here. They have all documents... ...passports. And you can fuck off! Really? Fakes. - Bad ones. - And you, too, fuck off. - Okay, Viko, - And you, too, ...fuck you! - Get the blankets out of the van and get these girls out of here. Okay, girls, come on. You're safe. Just come. All right, come. Let's go, Let's go. Don't be afraid, we can all go now. Raya, come on. It's going to be okay. All right? Come on, Raya. Let's just... Come on, what's the matter? What? What's the matter? What the fuck are you doing here? We got a call about this raid. Oh, yeah. From who? Get out. Get out. Come on, get out. Get out. Out! - Get out right now! Get out. - Get your hands off me. Fuck! Don't look at these guys. Don't be afraid of these guys. Just say you want to go and I can walk you... Raya, I can walk you out of here, right now. You just have to say you want to go, that's all. Don't look at him. Look at me. I want you to look at me. You safe. You are safe. Listen to me, don't look at him. Out of here! Just get out! Fuck! Okay, Raya, just look at me, just look at me. Please. Okay just say yes. Just say yes. It's all you have to do. Raya, please. Just say you want to go. No. Just say you want to go. No. Fuck! What the fuck is the matter with you? Don't you know anything! We are supposed to protect these people. - You're a crazy bitch! ...to protect these people. I know this girl. I know this girl. I can't leave her here. Let's go. Come on, Raya. Let's go. I can't leave her here. - I can't leave her here. - Look at me! Kathy! We cannot force them. Nothing will hold up in court. Please understand. They will be brought down here, punished. You want blood on your hands? You fuck! You piece of shit. You fuck! What the fuck is the matter with you people? What is the matter with you. My husband arranged for me a job. But his friend bought me for $2,000. With renewed funding from USAID the Global Displacement Agency... ...continues to be a pioneer at international counter-trafficking. My sister arranged for my papers. Her boyfriend did this for 12 other girls. Mostly traffickers prey on those they know, banking on the fact that the girl will trust them. Traffickers can be fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles... Are you sure you want to see? Excuse me. Would you please cover her up? Could you find a blanket, please? Could you cover her up? I am a police officer obligated to report crimes. I have taken statements from women describing their physical... ...psychological... ...and emotional torture. On arriving in Bosnia, these women are sold... ...and forced to provide sexual services. Their clientele consists of SPOR... ...IPTF... ...local police... ...and international employees. Worse, they have become involved in the trade itself. It is time each and every one of you realize this is a serious organized crime... ...with enormous profits. We are peacekeepers who came to protect the innocent... ...but now prey upon them in the worst ways possible. We maybe accused of thinking with our heart instead of our heads... ...but we will have our humanity. Good morning. I have to ask you to surrender your ID. What? What's going on? You've been ordered out of this mission. You can't be serious. I'll need the ID. Thank you. Guys... Come on. Why do you want to get rid of her? Madeleine, I have to protect this organization and so should you. The UN is too fragile, too important. That's what immunity is for. Immunity not impunity. The United Nations was formed from the ashes of Auschwitz. The United States led the way and it's a point of honour with me... ...that the UN is not remembered for raping the very people we must protect. Those girls are whores of war. It happens. I will not dictate for morality. So what are we dictating for? I'll go to Washington. I'll go to the State Department if I must. Democra isn't even based out of the States, it's based out of England. It's a private corporation. We work in the real world. Thank you so much. Really helpful. I had to send that e-mail. They killed Raya. - They shot her in the head. - I know. She wanted to testify and they made an example of her. I'm responsible for this. No, dear, you're not. I promised her I would protect her. Oh God, I can't stop thinking about her mother. How do we tell people what's happening here? Democra is registered in the UK, in Britain. So you are entitled to appeal your dismissal. We've got to get those files out of the mission right away. Because you're a whistleblower, so the press will want to know. I handed in my ID and my keys. Shit! I don't know how to get in there. We'll have to find a way. Zoe, Zoe. What are you doing here? I need to get something out of my office. I was wondering if you could get me a set of keys. Kathy, I can't. It's too risky. I would lose my job. I wish I could help, I really do. I'm sorry. I'm just not like you. You scared me. Sorry, I didn't recognize the coat. We don't have much time. Kathy I can't go up there with you. - You understand, right? - Yes. Alright, now make certain you get everything. And that includes any files you didn't send to I.A. Or to me. Yes. If anybody's going to believe this, the press needs to see it all. Okay, I'll meet you in the atrium, ...right. - Okay.
