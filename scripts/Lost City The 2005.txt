And to this, the happiest of families. May it be that way forever. Hear, hear.Salud. Salud. Salud. Dance with me, as you once did? You make me sound like a relic. My relic. Donoso, would you dance with me? watch yourself. Uncle has two left feet now. His elbow, it works fine. l would give an arm and a leg and an elbow forjust one single waltz. My kingdom for a cha-cha-cha! Hear, hear. Let's go dance. I'll be right back. wait here. what's wrong? So which one of those dancers is your girlfriend this week? who are you saving yourself for? No one. All the good ones are already spoken for. Fangio, I want to present to you my wife Mercedes Fellove. Come on, let's go. This meeting was my idea... because these are very difficult times, as you know. Cuba has always lived in difficult times, but through them all, we have been able to survive because we have always been united. But our country isn't safe anymore, and it threatens us. Your uncle and I are all that remains of our generation. So, my sons, you are the future. The future of our family. The future of this island. Yes, and look at me. Look at me, because this is for you, too. lf we want to change the status quo, we must go about it in a democratic way. You hear? we must be patriots. Patriots. Patriotism is a refuge for scoundrels. Do you lt is politics that has become the practical refuge of Papi, do not make the mistake of confusing me for one of your students. I'm not. I graduated. Hey. Show a little respect. No, no, no, no. Let him talk. Let him talk. This is a democracy. oh, this country, a democracy? Right. our family is a democracy. This country is my family, and the only way to truly unite that family is revolution. Revolution? Revolution, yes. l just can't believe it. A son of mine that would support the random violence of revolution? You better start believing it. what you need is a little evolution, not revolution. Correct. The poet. Club owner, poet. You're lucky you're on the other side of the room. l feel lucky, because it probably stinks on that side of the room. Please. Happy Anniversary. You are too much. Did I forget to say that? Happy Anniversary? Just watch your mouth. what? You've been watching it the whole time. lf I hear one more word of disrespect coming out of your mouth, I'm gonna deal with it personally. Do you understand me? what? You understand what I just said to you? l understand You listen to your father when he's speaking to you, and you show respect! Calm down, Fico. No, you calm down! okay. okay. okay. okay. You want me to come overthere? okay. Huh? You want me to come overthere? Stop it! Come on. Come on. Stop it! Stop it. Four against one, huh? Stop it. Sit down. Sit down. ls this a democracy? Sit down. You got your little show. Sit down. Sit down, right? How is it? Sit down! ls this a random act of violence, Papi? Huh? They shot Lieutenant Dario. Did they get good descriptions this time? Did he mention Peligro again? Mm-hmm. what happened? I'm not gonna have this conversation with you, you, you, or any of you. You know what? You have no idea what's going on in this country. lt's sad that you're a professor and you have zero zero idea of what is going on in your own classroom. Then can you enlighten me? Can you tell me what's going on? Discontent, anger... desperation. That's what's going on in this country, everywhere in this country, and especially at your university. Revolution, okay? lt happened in France, it happened in Russia, and it's happening here, and it's happening now. Nobody wants a revolution. You don't want a revolution. But like it ornot, it's coming. The people, they want it. How do you know? Has the people of Cuba spoken to you in your chosen ears? No. Batista must be eliminated. And then what? Freedom. Democracy. Right, yeah. Powerto the people. That's easier said than done. lt can be done, but the first thing you have to do is kill that son of a bitch. kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. Have you ever thought to live for your country? Yes. Live. I am living! l live, and I let die. Let the tyrant die. Afish is caught by its mouth. You need the earth on your hands, not blood. Take sanctuary at the farm. My son doesn't need sanctuary. He just needs to reform his character, for a man's character is his destiny. what book did you get that from? Maybe you should read a couple. where do you stand, Fico? where do you stand? Right here with my family. l see that. You're just a spectator. You just watch the parade go by. Let me tell you something, Fico. Your days of hiding in this cork-lined palace are numbered. Pretty soon, you and you and you and you are gonna have to make a decision. Are you in the parade, or are you not? l have made my decision. That means good night! Good night in Cuban! Buenas noches! Buenas nochesto you all! Good evening. That depends. lt usually does, doesn't it? lt was a great show tonight. Great show. Do you know a guy named Peligro? who? Peligro. ls he a percussionist? would you know a guy named Alberto Mora? ls he a friend of yours? Someone here to see you. l had nowhere else to go. Have you seen him? All the time. Next time you see him, say good-bye. when I get to the pearly gates, you know what I'm gonna ask for, don't you? A bottle of Bacardi? No, a case. Don't forget the Victrola. You're not going anywhere without your dance partner. okay, I'll stay. Viejo. what is he saying? Uh-oh, the ticking clock. Fico. well, I wanted to say that in our house, Sunday dinneris not... A moveable feast. Uh-huh. All my sons are welcome, but not... Not after 6. And it is 6 and 3 minutes, Fico. l know, but I thought he said after6. okay. okay. Now, um... l want to make a wish. lf change is going to come to our country, l wish that our home remains an island, and that despite all of our differences, we always put family first. And food second. Salud. Salud. lt's a joke, my brother. I'm just kidding. So it's all in the family. lt's all in the family. l tell you, l swear to God it is. Hello, Senator. How are you? I've been better. l come to see your father. No one knows more about constitutional law. Am I interrupting? l mean, he's picking for compliments, Senator. okay, I'm gonna give you one. Do you think the light interrupts the day? Sometimes. we intend to pass a resolution that will remove Batista through the constitutional process. Senator Cossio has asked me to prepare a speech forhim. This is the opening statement. Uh, I've made reference to Seneca. Read it aloud, Senator, so we can hearhow it sounds. okay. Please. Mr. Speaker, l must protest... as Seneca did in ancient Rome, of the violence of office. Today, we, the citizens of Cuba, are being persecuted by a tyrant and his reign of terror, meted out to our population by his police, and especially by a certain colonel in the force whose name has become synonymous with sudden death. Seneca was persecuted by two tyrants, Caligula and Nero. ln spite of that, Seneca advocated the return to the Republic... unafraid. Mr. Speaker, Seneca, not the Neros of this world, should be an example to us. Fangio, I am your biggest fan. Get in the car. Just get in the car. Get in the car. Get in. what do you want? Money? Publicity. Fangio freed, Grand Prix cancelled, And listen to what Fangio said. All they wanted from me is that I help them further their cause. But I don't know anything about causes, only cars. And when they ask him how he was treated, They were quintessential gentlemen. Do you think I'm a quintessential gentleman, Mercedes? Huh? what was so funny? what were you laughing about? The funnies. The funnies? That newspaperhas no funnies. why don't you try the one about the kidnappers who only wanted publicity? Stop it! That's funny. That's funny. Leave him alone! Stop! Yeah. Come on. Stop! Let him go! Please stop! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Huh? You want to be tough? Huh? wanna play in my city? Spoiled rich bastard! You do not want to disappoint me. Believe me. I'm gonna go for a walk. when I get back, l want you to tell me who Peligro is. I'm back. who's Peligro? Huh? You're not a good listener. whoa, whoa, whoa. ooh. No, I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm gonna go for a walk, okay? So you betterbe thinking about who Peligro is, 'cause you're next. Let's go for some coffee. You're here about your brother. Your little brother's a criminal a dangerous criminal. No doubt about that. I've got his file if you wanna read it. No, thank you. l know my brother, and no file will ever change that. Fico, we've known each other since we were in prep school. I've always been straight with you. That's true. Have you everknown me to change my signals? Not when you were my catcher. Fico, you're pitching for your brother now. You're pitching wild. He's guilty. There's no doubt about that. l know it and you know it. He's my brother, Braulio. l need your help. okay. l think you should get out of Havana, go to New York orMiami, and I'm gonna take care of the tickets. Fico, FideI's gonna take care of me. I'm leaving for the Sierra Maestra. Hey. Fico, I have no choice. what about your family? Everything I do is formy family. l love you. Uh, come in. Can I help you? Al sent me. who? Al. He's a friend of yours, isn't he? Are you auditioning? Yes, I am. what's your line? I'm a comedian. I'm a stand-up comedian who prefers to remain seated. That's it? That's your line? Yeah. Some jokes for your emcee. He writes his own jokes. They're lousy. So are yours. Touch? You want some help writing some of your other material? Nobody writes anybody's material around here. You just improvise? You can call it that. Try New York. Too cold. Too rich. Too close to home. well, I'm afraid you're going to have to find anotherline of work, then. l can't. The laughter you just become addicted to it. what'd you say your name was? l didn't. l said Al sent me. lf you know Al, you know me. oh, AI's friend. where've you been? where haven't I been? Federico, remember your appointment. And don't forget your dancing shoes. You're going to need them. oh, Rodney? Maestro? oh, nevermind. l think I have a job for you after all. Finally, after all these years of sacrifice and dedication, a break. why can't you tell me who we're meeting? lt's betterthat way. l love surprises. Just don't say a word no matterwhat. Sit there, pretend you're my security. That's it. How's this? Cozy enough? Look a little bit more dangerous. How about this? More dangerous. This is my meanest. Save that. Can I make a wish? Be my guest. l wish for a tall, athletic, caramel-colored beauty. okay. An open-doorpolicy is the sign of a great host. Mr. Lansky, come in. welcome. Should I call you Federico, Mr. Fellove, orFico?

That's funny. would you like a drink? A little seltzer, unless you happen to, uh... have an egg cream. l have eggs and I have cream. And you have a blind comedian. Mute. An egg cream is neither egg nor cream. would you like to know how to make one? well, that would've been my next question. well, let??s see how this goes first. A little seltzerfornow.

Le Chaim. l propose a partnership between us. the rest to me, my associates. lt doesn't have to be anything big. l mean, this is very cozy here. You could have a couple of tables, craps, you know, blackjack, a wheel ortwo. This is nice. Mr. Lansky Call him Meyer. or Mr. Lansky. You want him here? Meyer, I appreciate the offer, but, regretfully, I have to pass. Now, I know this is a tremendous opportunity for me. However, El Tropico is a place of music, and that's how l would like it to stay. Let me rephrase. we have the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship. lt would be a pity to see it end before it even began. Yes, it would. All right. l was informed you were a reasonable man. l hope I wasn't misinformed. You weren't. what I can offeryou in return is what I offer all my friends an open-doorpolicy. Considermy club your home any time. what, free seltzer? As much as you want. You know, in my business, Mr. Fellove, we have friends and we have enemies, but we don't have acquaintances. l hope to hear some good news very soon. ls that Meyer Lansky... Meyer Lansky?

Do you know what that is? No. lt is the Hindu word Forpassive resistance. Gandhi resisted passively, and he won. My son, in the sea, even a shark can drown. okay, we all know how to make it into the Presidential Palace by heart now?

I'm a fortunate man forhaving had to sign one single death warrant. Mr. President, if I might say so myself, you are a fortunate man, but also a noble man. Thank you, Pizzi. That's very kind of you. No, no, no, no, no. lt is not kindness. lt is historical justice. Have I evertold you how much I appreciate you? No, sir. oh. Sorry I'm late. l got stuck in Pinelarillo what do you want? l got 450 napkins and tablecloths. I'm gonna need help getting it out of here. l don't have any deliveries on my list today.

People of Cuba, the dictat orFulgencio Batista has just met revolutionary justice. The gunfire that extinguished the bloody life of the dictator can still be heard around the Presidential Palace. lt is we, The Directorio Revolucionario, the iron hand of the Cuban Revolution who have accomplished the final blow against this shameful regime still twisting in its own agony. Cubans who can hearme, he has just been eliminated. Long live a free Cuba! Que vive una Cuba libre! Carbo! Carbo! Luis! Luis! Luis! Luis! Luis! Pizzi, leave us alone. with friends orwithout friends? As you like. Pizzi. Yes, sir? People of Cuba, today alien forces made an attempt on my life. As you can see, the news of my demise is vastly exaggerated. The President now declares business as usual in Havana. l lend a helping hand to those law-abiding citizens and our loyal oppositions. The future of Cuba is safe. Abuelo! our children are safe. That is all. Salud. Life is becoming a dress rehearsal for a show nobody'll see. what's the word on Luis? He's nowhere to be found. Are you sure he's alive? Positive. He might be abroad. He might be abroad. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm sorry. There's no news. was he part of the attack? Yes. why won't you tell me where he is? Because I don't know where he is. Fico, if something happens, l want to be there... forhim. So do l. May I offer a serious thought from someone who's never serious? No. well, that was it. Mmm. lt's good. A man with a purpose. A man with less of a purpose. Fellove, come on. Please join me. Mmm. Mmm! ln our house, Sunday dinner is not a moveable feast. lt is at 6, as usual. Sorry. All my sons are welcome, but.. not a minute after6. You must always chew. lt's good for your health. You chew and you chew. Mmm. And then you chew some more. See, I'm a man of... good digestion. ln fact, if I wasn't such a modest man, I'd say I'm a man of great digestion. That's why I'm still alive. About our little business... our business? Yeah, our business. My business is El Tropico. And I would love to continue going to El Tropico. So unless that's a prop for one of your new shows... I'm asking myself, what is a song and dance man because that's what you do, huh? Just a little song and dance, and you put on a little show doing with a .32 caliber Smith & wesson? what? Hey! what? what, are you planning to shoot your piano player? Do you have a new cowboy routine in El Tropico now, or something? Any word from Ricardo? No. why were you late for dinnertonight? Hmm? l have enemies. Cono. And I have the right to protect myself. Cono. Fellove, am I your enemy? You weren't my enemy until you killed my brother. Luis Fellove, alias Peligro. Not angel, not the Virgin Mary Peligro! l swear, l did not kill your brother. Your brother attacked the Presidential Palace with the intent to kill my President. He committed suicide. Believe me, you do not want to disappoint me. Trust me on this. l can see all you have is thirst for revenge. Ah, I see. You know what a zugzwang is? lt's a chess move. Mm-hmm. lt is a chess move that is no move at all. lt is actually a position the position in which each player will obtain a worse result if it were his time to move than if it were not. Do you follow? A double-bind. A reciprocal situation. All you have to do is act accordingly. which means... Do not act at all. Go. Ho ho ho! Hey, hey! Bravissimo, Fellove! Bravissimo! A showman to the end! one more audition. So just about any clothes fit you, huh? She's very lonely. Ever since she moved in, she won't go out at all. Not even with her friends. The memory of your brother, and the fact that she has not been able to have a family of her own... l hate to see her so sad. lt breaks my heart. why don't you ask her out? She would like that. lt would do her good. She needs you, and you need her. Fico, talk to me. Please. You know the last thing Luis said to me before he died? what? He made me promise... that if anything everhappened to him, l would take care of you. You've grown up in Havana all your life, and I bet there's parts of the city you don't know at all. I'm sure you know them well. You know... Havana's very much like a rose. lt has petals, and it has thorns. So it depends on how you grab it. But in the end, it always grabs you. why don't you come out with me tomorrow? lt'll do you good. You ever see Beny Mor? live? Mmm. Ah! Have you been to the Tropical BeerGardens? Ah! lt's good to see you smile. Thank you. why are their handkerchiefs? The handkerchiefs are so there's no evidence. of what? of the intimacy they're sharing. Beny! Beny! Beny! Beny! Beny! Beny!

How many more are in the barracks? Fellove! Let's move. Don't waste any time with that. Let's move. You seem troubled, Fellove. ls it about the captain we shot? Listen to me very carefully. ln an insurrection, the end justifies the means. what is an insurrection? Huh? Armed struggle. what is the end? Revolution. which entails social, economic, and political transformations. Like I said?? the end justifies the means. Hmm? This is Havana. who said a woman is like a flower? A poet with a sense of smell. May I join you? Yes. what was your name again? My name again is no name. what do you mean? l don't mean nothing! Names don't mean, people do. But you are people, aren't you? That...nobody can deny. So what's your name, then? l have no name. l already told you that. Everybody has a name. Mm-hmm. Everybody but me. why not? l don't know. Ask him. Leave me out of your puns. You're the strangest man l evermet. Thank you. Thank you. okay, Emilio. Your money's no good here. Thank you, Emilio. I'll see you at the club. when I grow up, l wanna be just like him. why? Because... he neverpays. we interrupt this program with a special news report. The University of Havana was closed by the government today, as a direct result of the ongoing riots. President Fulgencio Batista, who is underintense pressure to resign, declared publicly today that the government will not tolerate the disgracing of the sacred grounds of the university's Plaza Cadena, which he claims the professional agitators were using fortheir selfish acts of anarchy. She wants to talk to you. lt's okay. El tiempo no estacon ustedes. what did she say? Time is not on our side. Fico! Fico! Braulio. Hey! Happy New Year. Happy New Year. How are you?

They control the union. l see. And underwhat grounds do you have to come here and stop my show? You just can't use the saxophone in the orchestra anymore. Come again? The saxophone is a instrument of the imperialists. The saxophone was invented by a man named Sax in Belgium! Do you know what the Belgian imperialists are doing in the Congo?

Actually, I'm masquerading as an exile. well, your impersonation is quite good. I'm still in Cuba. where do you think I am, Jersey City? Joe DiMaggio. Minnie Minoso. He looks in. Yeah, you latched on that one. Hmm, where we going? El Dragon Rojo, a Cuban-Chinese restaurant which is neither. But they are under the illusion I'm a writer.

Good one. Thank you. Ahem. Thank you. Look, Fico, I've been... I've been thinking. You know, it bothers me to see you, Fico Fellove, working in the kitchen. Nonsense. Now, I've told you before l appreciate the work. well, anyway, I was thinking. what if I set up a piano in the cafe? would you be interested in... Unfortunately, the pay would be the same, but plus tips. whateveryou need. Hmm? You know I appreciate it. Mm. I'd like to keep this job, too. l need the extra money. I'm trying to bring my family. Enough said. Enough said. To free Cuba. Salud. Salud. The present you are living in is so thin, you could squeeze it underneath a door. The trouble with exile is exile. Thank you. l have a solution.

Gentlemen, time to suffer. The door was open. You know, the thing I love most about New York is that you're always running into old friends. You know why we're friends? Because we don't believe in coincidences. Please sit down. You may considerme an enemy, but I've always considered you a friend, Federico. l may at times have lost my patience at times, but neverwith a man I respect and that respects me in kind. How we doing there, Joe? Flirting. Good. Take your hat off. Ah, she was a beautiful thing, Havana. we should have known she was a... a heartbreaker. And here we are. lt's bashert destiny. Now, listen. Listen hard. l didn't bomb your place, kid. That's not my style. okay? May I have an egg cream? Chocolate syrup, cold milk. Spritz the seltzer until it foams up over the top.

You know, even in rejection lead me on a little bit, hmm? Don't break my heart... just yet. You like egg cream. Yes, I like egg creams. And I'm not crazy about humidity, either. You give my regards to your family. You have the ingredients right. There's an art with the seltzer spritz. Your chocolate goes at the bottom with milk overit, and then you spritz straight down, but then you spritz around the glass until it rises to the top. Always a pleasure, Lansky. l mean Mr. Meyer. Love your wieners. Bueno,Fico. Good night. okay, have a good time. keys are in the back. Have a good time. Good night, Mrs. Calabash, whereveryou are. Gentlemen, don't burn the place down.

Yes, I know. You lost your club. No, that's not what I meant. You sound bitter. Not at all. l have no money... but I feel... as though I'm worth more than I ever was. would it do any good to say I'm sorry? No, not really. Try at least to understand me. I've understood more than you could explain. why don't you come back to Cuba with me? Because it's dangerous... for my soul. l see you still do not believe in causes. well, I don't have a loyalty to a lost cause. But I do have a loyalty to a lost city. And that's my cause and my curse. Please don't hate me, then. I'll never hate you. I'll always love you. why can't you love me there? Too big of a price to pay. Be well. Stop crying.
