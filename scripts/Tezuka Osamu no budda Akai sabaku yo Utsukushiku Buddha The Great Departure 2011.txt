Makkhali Gosala-sama was surprised by an exceptional case. And with that he understood cycle of causes of the world. Na radatta Yes. I feel a strong power in the south. You go down tomorrow and go south to find someone elegant. Yes, Asita-sama. But Who is that person That person is someone who might be the king of the world. Suddhodana. Looks like the beasts in the forest are trying to tell us something. What the... Your Highness, the Queen Maya! Maya! Your Highness. Maya, is it true? Yes. I dreamed that a glorious white elephant with six teeth went into my body. What an extraordinary dream. Yes, even the beasts in the forest acted as if they were waiting nxiously for something as well. Human beings and everything else on earth are celebrating for it as well. Look. Monsoon season is coming soon. However, the rivers show no signs of drying. That's right. May be we have been blessed with a great life. I think this boy that will be born will bring something good to the world. A great gift that is unlimited like the sky. In the past, at the foothills of the Himalayas, beside the Indian River, there is a race. They are the Aryans. They have conquered Indian natives in the south and the east and appoint themselves as the King. Many countries have been born in many places. Today, it has become the great empire Kosala and conquered the lush country Shakya. That's Sorry. Hey, watch your steps. Sorry, I was in a hurry. Oh? Items that you're carrying is good.

I will not be able to see her again. Let me help your mother. How? You are mine. If you look tense and difficult while you're walking, your value will decrease. Walk faster. Pity. Will they be sold to a slave market? Mother. Chapra, wait here no matter what happens. This time the slave market is very lively. You should be sold at better prices. Tiger! Mother! Mother. Chapra Tatta! What an extraordinary power... Perhaps it is this child? Conquer! Bansai, Kosala! Advance! Kosala army intended to attack the Kapila City. Kapila City? It is the national capital of Shakya. Kosala try to conquer the fertile country. With this, they will go through our village! Tatta! Advance! Advance, beat them! Kill them! That person is the leader. Mother, sister. I must take revenge Tatta, I will help as well. Look at the format of our Kosala army. Shakya would have surrendered. Let us celebrate. Oh! There's so many people. How are we going to get near the leader? Leave it to me. I have an idea. Sorry, I would like to borrow your body. Ghost? Who is that? After it, hurry! What is the matter? Make way! Crush him! General, General! Oh no! Boy, you're quite bold. Tatta! Kill him! Locusts, a large group of locusts! Get lost! Tatta! Remain in your position! Tatta, pursue the leader! You will not be able to escape. Please help me. Is there anyone there? Wow! Help! Crocodile, crocodile! Die, enemy of Tatta! Please help me! What exactly do I want? Become slave that is tortured to death? Please, please Tatta! I'm sorry... I want to use this person. This person is a chance of a life that is bestowed by the God. Tatta, I want to go to Kosala and use the Kosala army led by this man. Then I sure will be popular. We can only live in poverty in this condition. Your Highness, the Kosala army had retreated from the Rohini river in one night. What? There's a locust invasion, and the enemy's food has been destroyed and they had to pull back. General Pudai of the Kosala Army I was gone, too. This is great. Maya, how are you doing? I'm fine. That's great. The war can be avoided because of this child. With this, your way home will be safe. Ah, I will go back for delivery. Thank you for your understanding, Tatta. Tatta, go back and tell my mother. Someday, I will come back for her. Okay. Go, Tatta! Ah, that is General Pudai! General Pudai is seriously injured. Get the doctor. General Pudai! Treat him, hurry! Ah General Pudai. Is it you? The one who saved me General You can not move yet. Come here. How can I repay you? Please rest well. My condition is bad. Well? How about you follow me? I' m honou red, General Stop the sedan. My Lady, My Lady... If you wanted to go home, we had to cross the Rohini river. Let's spend the night by the river today. How's the Queen? She is resting. Well, we must be careful. Understood. There's no wind at all. The leaves do not move as well. This is What is happening? This warm light It's as if the whole forest is alive. He's born! The Prince is born! Ah, this is The Heir to Shakya was born. Congratulations, Your Highness! Congratulations to the Shakya! The whole world is blessing you. What an extraordinary boy. My Lady! My Lady! The Queen is in danger! Hurry back to the city! Maya. Come and see. This is our baby. I've thought of a name. How about Siddhartha? Siddhartha It means Someone people who achieve his goal. What a great name. Maya! Honey... This kid is sure to be someone extraordinary. Someone who has great soul and faith. Maya! Asita-sama, welcome. It is our honor to obtain mercy from you. Asita-sama, why? Please look at the hands of this child. One finger pointing to the sky. Another finger pointing to the ground. Isn't it I am the most revered in heaven and on earth? This kid is going to be king of the world. But, I will not be able to witness that. Siddhartha-sama! Prince! Where is he hiding? The King is looking for him Minister Gotani. Oh, Prince. You told me once that there are four types of people in this world, right? Yes. There are four types of people in this world. Brahman is the best. They conduct important ceremonies in our lives. Prosperity of the country also depends on the prayers of the Brahmins. How does prayer prosper the country? T-That's... In short, the Prince and King also have to listen to the Brahmin. Below the Brahmin is the Kshatriya warrior and the aristocracy. Siddhartha-sama is the greatest among the Kshatriyas, The Royal. Prince! Siddhartha-sama. Prince! Please wait, the King is waiting for you. And below that? Uh it is the public and merchants, they are the Vaishyas. The most ignorant are the Sudras. They are slaves, laborers and others. Why are the slaves the most ignorant? That Isn't it good? Your father is calling for you, hurry. I've heard about your performance in Magadha. The future of Shakya depends on you as well. Understood. Father. I have been waiting for you, Siddhartha. Let me introduce our new General. Famous archer, Bkamuka. It's my honour to meet you, Prince. At the same time, Kosala conquered the surrounding country gradually. Everything went smoothly. Bansai, Kosala! It's the guards! Kosala Army is really great! That's great! Unparalleled! That's Chapra-sama, who replaced General Pudai. Bansai, Chapra-sama! Chapra is really handsome! Finally, I have come this far. In order to beat Kosala, you need to grow up quickly and become great warriors. Okay. Teacher. Will the war really lead to death? Not for all. There are people who survive as well. What happens if you die? There will be a funeral. After the funeral, what happens to the dead? I came here to teach. Not to debate. The lesson is really boring. Let's go and play. Come on, hurry. Ouch. This is the first time I came here. Siddhartha never go outside? Yes, I've never been out of the palace. Ah, a rabbit. Look at this. Okay. Bastard. Do not run! I say do not run! Do not run! Stop. What are you doing? I missed it. I almost had it. Over there. Yes. Hurting living creatures Is this a dream? My legs can not move, help me. Help! Ah, Djedka. Ah, I can not move. I'm sinking. Dj ed ka Please help me! My legs can not move. Hey, are you okay? Please help me. Come on, hurry. Help! Dj ed ka Dj ed ka Siddhartha! Thank goodness you are okay. Djedka is dead, Djedka Siddhartha. Prince. The King has come. Thank you. Siddhartha Mother, forgive me It's okay. Get some sleep. Okay. How's Siddhartha? I'm sorry. My dereliction of duty has caused the situation to be so. Maya is week after giving birth to that child. You must show more love than his mother. Thank you, Prajapati. It's nothing. Siddhartha is 10 years old. It's about time for him to take martial arts training. From today, he will teach you martial arts. Even though he is a prince, you do not need to hold back. Please leave it to me. Well, Prince. You need to tighten your armpits. What is this? How can you beat the Kosala army like this? Isn't it too violent? The Prince is only 10 years old. Your attacks are too weak. Prince, do not get lost. Stop! Prince, why you being tender-hearted like a woman? Please stop. I'm sorry. To be a king, you need the power and not kindness. That's it for today. Chapra, Chapra, Chapra! Chapra! Chapra-Dono! Father. Well done, Chapra! If you win the next battle, the King's Cup is yours. I sure will win and earned the title of Hero. I will not embarrass General Pudai. I will pray that Chapra-Dono win the Kings Cup. I am really surprised. She is the daughter of the Minister, Ms marika. Son of General Pudai, Chapra-Dono. Son of Unbabuda, Bindika-Dono! Both of them will compete here to obtain Kosala King's Cup! Finally I've come this far. Hey Hey! Get up, get up, get up! Get up, get up, get up, get up! Chapra-Dono It's not over yet lwillwin. Why you. I am different from you. I can not lose. Stop! Well done, Chapra! Son of General Pudai, Chapra-Dono, you will receive the title of Hero and the Champions Cup as the greatest warrior in Kosala. Now, I have joined the ranks of the aristocracy in the end. I am no longer a slave. I can go get my mother. Ouch Ms. marika, watch it. What? It is just a small wound. My heart almost exploded when was watch the competition. Okay, now for the wound on the left leg. Ouch! Ah, if Chapra-Sono married my daughter, there is nothing more exciting than this. The pleasure is ours. If your child is willing to marry him, we would be honored. Say, Chapra-Dono is the son of your sister who had died, right? Pudai is a famous family because of the martial arts. Congratulations, congratulations. Are you the one who saved me? Chapra, you are the lucky one. You have got the title of the Hero of Kosala. And engaged to the popular Marika. You are in a different world from us. This is the result of the effort. Good-bye, you are buying. What is with him? If the truth that you are a Sudra is busted, the two of us will be done for. You must keep it secret. Do you hear me? Wow, that's amazing. The Prince has became stronger day by day. Siddhartha has become strong at the age of 15. After training for five years, you have become very strong. His body becomes stronger as well. Siddhartha-sama! Siddhartha-sama, please wait! You will be scolded by the King. Siddhartha-sama! Oh no He is gone. My child Do not cry, this is life It was his fate that he was born here. Please please help us We all left here after being ill. No one will save us even until we are dead. Please help us Ah It is silk. It is ours. You do not need it. They will die soon even if you gave it to them. So, give us that instead. Is there anything else? Wait. Let him go. But Sister Do not talk back. If you dare to touch him, we will all need to be beheaded. What is with this guy? Forget it. Do not fight with the sister. The whole town is looking for you. Hurry home. E-Excuse me... My name is Migaila. Do not do any unnecessary charity next time. They are only the elderly and patients abandoned by their families here and left to die. Your small charities are crueler if they have a nostalgic to the world. It is not like that. No matter how old or sick, they were still living souls. Too naive. Everyone die of old age and illness. You live in the city freely. You will not understand what is happening in the world. Do you understand the world that I do not understand? Hey, be careful. A. .. is that human food? This can be sold already. You do not get ill after eating this? No, let's go. Why do you want to see places like this? Ah, boy. This child should be treated like this. It's another slave boy. Give it back, boy. Give it back. This is the world that you want to know. Life is a pain for everyone. You will get sick and you will die as well. You and I, and that beggar, too. Migaila. That's all for today. Prince The weather is nice today. The view of the street looks very different from the river. People live in places like this. Is it okay for the Prince to be hanging out with someone like me? You care a lot for me. Naturally, I can not be excused if I approached you. Let alone talk to you. You said it before. I am just like you. Is that right? Migaila. Let's go for a swim. Like this. Come here, Migaila. Migaila, wait. Prince. Is it true that you have been hanging out with an ignorance woman? Ignorance woman? What do you mean... Shut up! You are the heirs of the King of Shakya. I hope that you will develop the country so that it is comparable to Kosala. You are not allowed to leave the city, do you understand? Ignorance? Migaila? Siddhartha Kill her. Kill this robber. This woman has robbed our country, Shakya. Kill her. Kill her, kill her! Kill her, kill her! Siddhartha Let me go! No, the King is having a meeting. Let me go! Father! Why did you arrest Migaila? What is so important that you have to find me during this important meeting? Please let Migaila go. It is about the robber, huh? Father, if you kill Migaila, I will not forgive you. Do you still not understand? You are the one who do not understand. Are you mad? Siddhartha. What is wrong with love? Do not forget that you are entrusted with the mission to run the country. Then please let Migaila go. Prince, please stop. Prince. Okay. But with a condition. There is a princess named Yasodhara in the neighboring country. If you marry her, I will release the woman. Prince Siddhartha! Siddhartha-sama. Prince! Prince! Kill me... Kill me. I do not know Prince Siddhartha. Kill her, kill her! Kill, kill, kill! Kill, kill, kill, kill! I understand Let Migaila go. Prince, Prince! Migaila! You did you do to Migaila? To prevent her from seeing the Prince again, we have blinded her eyes. How do I describe this feeling? What an annoying task. Migaila To prevent you from suffering for me. Okay. Take her away. Stand up. Migaila! Okay, get going. Your face has been carved forever in my eyes. I am very happy to know you. Even if only for a short time, I feel very happy. Migaila Get lost. You will be a great king. Migaila Siddhartha, when you were born, Asita-sama had made a prediction that you will become a great king of the world. Wow. That's amazing. They have everything here. Looks delicious. Because Sravasti is the capital city of Kosala. The street is really busy. I heard that Chapra lives here. Where are we going to find him? Make way, make way. The General is here! Wait. Let's go and see. Isee him! Wah, the General was coming. Chapra Let's go to the house of General. No, I Eh? This is enough Why? You come a long way here. Looks like he is doing well. Kosala should attack Shakya another time. This is a good opportunity to conquer the fertile country Shakya. You're right. Yeah. That's right. Emergency letter! The war is about to begin! We are having war against Kosala? Shakya is a small country. In recent years, we are able to avoid war. Apparently not for this time. But You have to give me a good start. Me? Defeat Kosala, inherit my place and become the king of this country. Why are there wars? Humans killing each other If we do not fight, Kosala will be conquered. Even so How you can become a king like this? Why does the earth shake? The war has begun! Advance under the my leadership! Do not let the Kosala army move forward. Your identity is really good. Your people get killed one by one, and you can just stand there doing nothing. General Bkamuka, the poison arrows are here. I have been waiting for it. Once someone is shot by this arrow, no matter how strong he is, he would have died. Is it fun to kill people? Yes, it is fun. Especially when I defeated the enemy's leader. A coward will not understand this feeling. Advance under the my leadership! Siddhartha-sama, please come forward! Advance under the my leadership! Stop! Stop! Stop! It's Shakya's prince. He is the leader. I am the most deserving. Siddhartha-sama, Prince. Prince Siddhartha of the Shakya Prince, leave it here to us. Please return to the camp, Prince. This place is too dangerous! Your people get killed one by one, and you can just stand there doing nothing. The Prince's head is mine! Ha ha ha ha, the leader of the enemy will be defeated by me. That's the Kosala's warrior. He's difficult to get rid of. I have got an idea. W-what? Bastards, I had him. Why doesn't the poison work? What is with this feeling Chapra His eyes seemed to see through me. Felt like I was in endless sorrow and sadness. Am I going to die? Chapra-Dono, General Chapra! Chapra-Dono, Chapra-Dono! General, General. I have succeeded! That's the power of poison arrows. Soldiers of Shakya! I am the one who defeated the enemy's leader. I'm going to tell the King. The most deserving people in this war is me. Retreat! Retreated, hurry! Prince, please return to our army as well. Retreat, protect the Prince. Retreat! How? That The poison had spread. There is nothing I can do. Ms. marika. This battle is not set yet. Yes How's Chapra-Dono? I do not know whether he can survive for a day Tatta. How? I heard that Chapra can not be saved How could it be... Chapra Wait. Chapra will die Chapra! Calm down. Ah, that's right Asita-sama might know some magic potion. Where is he? In the temple in the Himalayas. Ah It's so far I will go. Ah? With my power, one day is quite enough. Tatta. That's all we can do. Well, I will write a letter quickly. We are counting on you, Tatta. Chapra Wait for me, Chapra. Asita-sama, please bless my son. What is this? It's a bird. Where did it come from? What's in its beak? Na radatta What is going on Na radatta Listen carefully. Na radatta Asita-sama. Do you know how many lives you have sacrificed to save one life? You must accept the punishment. I understand. But no matter what, I must think of a way to save Chapra. Na radatta You will travel in the wilderness like wild animals, right? Asita-sama! Na radatta-sama! What is it? A bowl of Nuruto powder, a drop of juice from the Pyracantha leaves, added in the Mayeela petals cooked with the Kalima skin. This medicine is going to save Chapra's life. What is the matter? A strange woman came in quietly. Maybe she wants to steal something. I am begging You Please give this medicine to Chapra-Dono. Please, please give this medicine to Chapra-Dono They look alike. Please give this medicine to Chapra-Dono. Well? The pulse and respiration are stable. Father... Rest well. Sorry for making you worry. Why aren't you resting? You sit here until late at night every night Do you have any concerns? Human die and get ill easily. Am I not able to do anything? Does someone have to give up when he suffers from incurable diseases, closed his eyes and wait for death in pain? Does someone have to walk towards the darkness? Life is really filled with suffering. I do not know anything. Although I was born a prince, but I do not know anything about things in this world compare to the public and ordinary soldiers. No, I am more ignorant than the people called Sudras. I want to know. I would like to learn all about the world. Siddhartha-sama. Get some rest, Princess Yasodhara. The Ministers blocked Miss Malika who wanted to come and visit. He will be fine tomorrow, right? Yes You are the son of General Pudai, Warriors Chapra. Forget everything about when you were a slave, understand? Why the sudden Where did that woman get the medicine? Shut up. No one mention anything about that woman. Got it? Understood. Could it be How's Chapra-sama? Why do you want to know? Please, Chapra-sama Sorry, but you must die. This is the order of General Pudai. W-Who is that? Let that woman go. Chapra-Dono Chapra You call him Chapra? Run. Chapra Hurry, Mother. Mother? Could it be ...? Chapra This must be Stop, Chapra. Chapra Chapra, you are saved. This is great Mother. You have done so well. Sorry I came late. I have come to get you, Mother. Oh no. Stop. Chapra Chapra Chapra Run! My body Hurry up... Get them. Kosala's hero? As a Sudra, you have cheated us. That fool. General Pudai. Did you adopt Chapra without knowing that he is a Sudra? Yes. So you have been cheated too? Y-Yes What the? Bring her here. Come on. Do not move. Kneel down. Sudras, are you Chapra's mother? Did you give birth to Chapra? Shut up. No. Chapra is not my child. I found him on the battlefield. Find him? That means Chapra is not a Sudra? Do not deceive me. He's not my child. Stop it, mother. Do not lie to save me. Chapra I was very frightened. I do not know when my identity will be exposed. But now I feel better. Chapra, do you admit that your real identity is a Sudra? Yes, I admit. Why do you keep it secret? Why can't a slave become aristocracy? Of course not! Who set the rules? I just want to end poverty and live without hunger, beaten, kicked and looked down. I do not want to experience all this again. That's why I Now for the punishment. General Pudai will be imprisoned. Chapra expelled from the country. It should be a death offense. But it can not be regarded as examples of the death of the offense as well. Chapra Chapra's Mother is sentenced to death. No way! My mother did nothing wrong. I am begging you, let her be casted away with me. No matter which dessert we shall go. Please, sir monk. Please take pity! Chapra Chapra, it does not matter. As long as you are alive Alive? How should I live Without freedom, a slave's life is full of suffering Please kill me, too. I will die with my mother. He is a liar and a slave, too. Serve him right. Ah. Chapra And his mother Bastard. You two will be sentenced to death for insulting the country. Okay, push them down. Do you aware now? Run! Chapra, run! What is with that boy? Kill him! Tatta, run! Chapra! Tatta! Chapra! Mother lam your child. Mother. Chapra Chapra! Dear, dear. Princess Yasodhara gave birth to a nice baby. A bright child, just like Siddhartha. No matter howl learn, I do not see anything. No one teach me anything. As a prince, Siddhartha who want to be the power of the people. Was confused. Because he realizes that people will experience birth, old age, sickness, and death. This is a bitter truth that can not be changed. No one can be excluded. Everyone is born through the narrow birth canal painfully. Despite being born, he will experience pain when getting old. He will experience the pain of illness. Then one day, he will face the pain of death. Past, present, future. As long as someone is alive, he will suffer until he died. The pain is not physical and mental pain. It will not be gone as desired. If someone expect something that will not become true, he will suffer. In order to accept and overcome the pain, Siddhartha wanted to find a clear path. There must be something I can do. I want to abandon everything to find them. Dad, I am leaving. Please forgive me for disappointing you. Siddhartha-sama, Siddhartha-sama. Channa. Siddhartha-sama, please go back. Dear. Siddhartha-sama. Bring Kantaka with you and go back. Siddhartha-sama? Return this to my mother as well. And Siddhartha-sama, what are you going to do from now on? Hand my hair to Yasodhara. Tell her, I will be back after I found the path of success. Pray for my trip. I'll leave Kantaka to you. Your Highness. What is the matter? The Kosala army has crossed the Rohini river! What? Advance! Advance, attack! You call me? Bkamuka. I hope that you can lead our army. Yes, but with a condition. Ah? I want to be king of this country. What? That is impossible. I'm not going to lead if I can not be the king. Is it not important if the Shakya is destroyed? Even if the country is destroyed by Kosala, it has nothing to do with me. Pledge that you will let me be the King of Shakya. I understand. Do not let the Kosala army step into Shakya! Destroy the Shakya! Attack! The enemy is confused, rushed in! Follow the leadership of Bkamuka! Do not let them step into our territory. Is that all that Kosala army can do, huh? Kosala Army, listen carefully. I am the new king of Shakya. At this time, Siddhartha had learned to pray for the first time. Siddhartha, someone who achieve his goals. You are sympathetic about the suffering of others. You will be able to find your way. Young Siddhartha had started his journey to find his path. He became The Resurrection Buddha. But that happened a long time after that.
