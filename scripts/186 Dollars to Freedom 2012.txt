He claims that no one can be under water for more than two minutes. Some can, I mean. For example, some young, someone who likes water. A surfer, someone like you. I think someone like you can be in water for more than two minutes. - You can not do that. It's torture. - Where you're wrong. It's just a friendly bet. I'm counting on you. You are like a fish. It will be fun for you. - One, two, three ... - It's not you count, you idiot. It is expected this. A ... two ... Three ... ... Wayne, I'm sorry. We must do it. Do not blame me.

You have to put me in touch with his family. It is important, very important. - Can I see him? - Of course. - What is wrong with this country? - That is why we need revolution. It was just a big party for me before. I did not know it was so much suffering here. We are strong - an ancient culture. Before the conquistadors arrived we were already a great civilization- -With architecture and culture. If you hear quechuasprket or dancing torril in Sapallanga- -Do you understand the power of our culture. People on the streets of Lima fought for justice. In a way, I did it too. I will not let them win. - Piojos. - What is it? - They live in your hair. - Lice. You have lice. You must have gotten them from Nicaragua. Thanks for telling me that. - Nicaragua, where does he come from? - He is from Colombia. - How do you know? - I am familiar with the accent. - Are you going to brush my teeth? - No, three razor blades. It's the only way. Either that, or a monkey. - Come on, then. - Okay? You get a nice Hare Krishna. It's funny. The hair is always been my trademark. It was a symbol of my freedom.

Look at me. Honey, look at me. I need you out there. They are crazy here. They try to break down me and they are trying to frame me. I'm not going to give me. I'm out of here. I need your parents telephone number. Please, give me that. - Wayne, look at me. - I will not pay them. Eden is out. Come on. I trust you. - Hot? - No. - Hot? - No. This is the right one.

Make sure the paint of their propaganda. You're coming with me. - He's a drug dealer. - How did you find out? He is from Colombia. Everybody knows that. Let me out now. - I'll call the Colombian consulate. - That was our agreement. Just because you are American sits you quietly among the political prisoners. Drug dealers ports in Lurigancho for life. Quiet? The bastard tried to drown me in the sea. - What do you say? - They took me to La Punta. They tortured me until I get them my money. $ 186 saved me. - Do you write in that it happened? - All prisoners tortured you, then? They are criminals that we are trying to get information from the country's best. - Do you write in it? - Yes. Then I can get away from Gutierrez your case and get you out of here. The game is over. You can not bluff more. They know who you are and you smuggle dope. They have called the Consul. Then go the next bus to Bogota. - Ramos will help me here. - I am happy for you. Thank you. Thank you made me fight Nicaragua. I feel reborn. - Colonel, you wanted to see me. - Stand up. I knew that it was only a matter of time. I have gringons signature that you tortured him and stole his money. The report will be on General Gardena's desk in the cow. - And you believe him? - I have written a report ... ... As you skate with you to your superiors on the PIP. You can not do that. I've already done. You are exhausted. What happened, Krishna? You and you, paint the wall. Hurry up! My son. My son. We must endure hardship ... ... Like education, for God makes us his sons. Which father's mother is not her son. - My son, I am here to save you. - No. My son, I'm hereto save you. God has sent me to save the world. God has sent me to destroy the world. The world is depraved- -Degenerate and full of sin. I will destroy the world to create it again. I need twelve apostles. Sex at my right hand and six on my left side. We will kill ... devils. All of them. - Will you be my apostle? - Yes. - What is your name? - Wayne Montgomery. No, from now on called you Peter. You, Peter, are cliff I build my church on. Seor, Hare Krishna is dead. Nicaragua is in the hospital and gringo in the basement. - Is everything under control? - Did not you hear what I said? - Is the third floor under control? - Yes. Stop here. The Colonel talking with General Cardenas. - Do not go into his office. - I understand. Peter, I command you opening the door. - I can not. I have no key. - You get one minute. Otherwise, I will send you to hell. No, please. Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! I am Jesus Christ! I and light path. Open the door! Sixty. Fifty-five, fifty-six, fifty-seven. Peter, I send you to hell! Hurry up. Hell! Out with you. Come on out! Mr. Beverly Hills. I know who you are. I tried to help you, but look what you've done. I have a phone and a telephone number. - How do we do. - Fuck you! - Lieutenant, Ramos is dead. - We must do something. I'll be back. People's war. People's war! - Help me. - No, seor. - I do not get involved. - Grab his legs. We can get jail for life. Do you know how much the prisoners hate us? Grab his legs! Idiot, help me! Fucking idiot.

Turn around, you pig. Disciples, now doomsday here. Do not worry, comrades. The battle has just begun. Come on! Help me, please. Stop! Wayne Montgomery? Seor, Wayne Montgomery? I will never know why so many had to die. I can only hope that Jorge died with the name of God on the lips. Maybe Jorge spread seeds on the wind and bloom up somewhere else. After the free elections that reinstated civil rights in Peru. In March 1081 Wayne received an apology from the new democratic government. People always ask why I did not pay them. It was about principles? Maybe. Maybe I'm just stubborn. Wayne is still today a teacher.
