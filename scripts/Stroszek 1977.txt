One accordion, Scandalli brand. Five packs of cigarettes... ...one handkerchief. One passport. A key chain. One bugle horn, must be from a rail gang. Probably. Name? - What? - Name. You must've gotten out of the wrong side of the bed. You've known my name for two and a half years. Formalities, Bruno. They're stupid, but we have to stick to them. Stroszek, Bruno. Height: 5'7", Eyes: Brown. - Face: Oval, no marks. - Fine. So, now for the formalities. Here's your passport... ...and your money. Count it, please. One bugle horn. One accordion. Bugle horn and accordion, all according to the rules. Fine. Bruno's going to send a signal. Because Bruno is now entering freedom. You can have my TV now, too. Bruno, look, I made the smallest ship. I won, and I'm going to give it to you. The smallest ship in the world. I'll take it home with me. Listen, I got a going away surprise for you, too. First I got to light a flare. It's a big surprise. Watch out now... Take care of yourself. See you on the outside, okay? I don't want to leave. Good luck, Bruno. I won't be seeing you any more... ...because I gotta go back to Turkey. Come a little closer, Bruno. Well, the big day has come... ...the day of your release. Moments like this make my job worthwhile, because it's a job... ...that involves many disappointments and much bitterness. Before you leave our institution... ...to return to a free life... ...I want to ask you a few questions. First, where will you live? I live at 5 Flotwell Street. My neighbor kept my apartment for me. And another thing, Bruno... Do you still like the taste of beer? Yes. I have a very, very serious word to speak with you. All of your crimes may be attributed to the abuse of alcohol. If the court finds you guilty one more time of such a crime... - Away with me. - Bruno, be reasonable. It started with the reformatory and ended with the jail. Away, away with me... ...into the shuttered seminaries. You're perfectly right. But if you don't stop... please listen. - If you don't stop drinking... - Who can stop? The court will say it's habitual and put you in security custody. Away with him. - Right. - Out. And now I'm going to give you some... please look at me. I'm going to give you some good advice now. First... ...if you do go into a bar, order a cup of coffee and a piece of pie. Second, buy yourself some good clothes, and keep your fly zipped. Dress a little better, just look at yourself. We've done all we could to help you. And wash your face, shave sometimes. - And something else, Bruno... - It goes in circles. No it doesn't, because I'll make sure you don't end up here again. I want you to promise me that you'll never touch another drop. My great Hungarian word of honor. Listen to me, before you start going off on a tangent. I want you never to touch a drop of alcohol again... ...and secondly, that you will never go into another bar. My great Hungarian word of honor. Mr. Striebeck, a beer. Well, Bruno, back again? Eva's here, too. Hello. Fuck off, creep. You heard me! Where do you get off doin' his chick? I didn't. Man, I saw you with her. You fucked her. So what? - What? Did you pull out? - No. Then you're a weenie. So what? Because you bought her. Bernd said you were through with her. Fuck what Bernd says. Don't drop me like this, Burkhardt. Did you hear something? Did somebody say something? Look how I'm crying. Don't you care at all? Got anything in the bank? Why should I? From your grandma, maybe? I didn't know about it. What do I care? Your old man's loaded, isn't he? Or maybe your grandma's got something laid aside. Where should I get it? Steal it for all I care. But you're gonna fork over ten grand. Look how I'm crying. I don't want to go, I want to stay with you. - Cry more and piss less. - I really want to stay with you. You gotta say something, man. What do you want me to say? Man, come off it, you can't pull this kind of shit. Maybe not, but this time it's gonna cost you ten grand. And the next time the price goes up to fifteen. And if you start makin' trouble... ...I'll stick a blade in your ass till it comes out your mouth, dig? Eva, come on, sit down here. It's all right, it's all right. Everything's going to be all right. Where've you been, Bruno? On vacation. Where am I going to go? What am I going to do? I've got a place. Mr. Scheitz kept it for me. You can sleep there. I'm starting a new life today anyway. Right. Good, it still plays. Now let's see what my 'Black Friend' says... One of these things here... ...a romance. I made you some coffee. Oh... This is my first coffee. Maybe we could put something... No sugar, no nothing... ...we could put something underneath. Yeah, right. We don't want any stains on it. And now comes the question. All my friends waited for me, but this is my best friend... ...my 'Black Friend'. What's going to happen to my friend when Bruno goes dead someday? Where are these things and these instruments going to end up? What's going to become of them? Someone must answer this for me. Yeah, my grand piano is a little worse for the wear. It's got spots on it. I don't know how to get 'em out. I'm going to get some things from my place and earn some money. We'll clean up the place a little. It really needs it, you know. But I'm here now, aren't I? It can't stay like this. - Hello, Mr. Scheitz. - Here's Good Boy Beo. I fed him and took good care of him. It's nice to see he's still alive. Come on in, you don't want to stand around outside. It's nice and warm in here. Just think, an old man like me going to America. My nephew wants me to come... ...he sent me an airplane ticket. But I'm not flying, because the airplanes are built all wrong. I'm taking a ship. Come here, come here. You really know how to talk, Beo. Taking the ship to New York and then to Florida. There's a park there where the bears run around free... You mean those grizzlies. Come here. Judith. - Eva, Eva. - This is Eva. Eva. She's your new girlfriend. A little bird came a-flying... It's amazing. Ladies and gentlemen, Bruno will now play his glockenspiel. Because Bruno now has Eva living with him. Sabine was a young lady, pure and virtuous was she. Her master she served right well, and ever so faithfully. Until a certain day... ...there came from Treuenbrietzen, a young man on his way. False hopes... ...he fell in love with Sabine, that simple cobbler boy. A worshipper, a proletarian. Enter poverty, he used up all his money, swilling gin and beer. Cheers, cheers, cheers... Then he ran back to Sabine, and asked for more from her. He did this... ...she couldn't give him any... ...for she was a poor, poor girl. So he went into her master's house. Six silver spoons to steal. Stuck 'em in his pocket. He double-crossed her, the rat. After eighteen weeks, the deed came out into the light of day. And the master raved and ranted, and drove poor Sabine away. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come. Come here. Jacob. Violin. Violin. What are you doing here? Smells like the plague, it stinks! It's probably the dogs. Ain't no dogs here. Well, they'll be coming soon. Then I'll probably have to open the door. Come on, creep. Cunt! I'm going to bury that runt up as deep as he'll go. Like a Christmas tree. With icicles and ornaments. Get that moron off my back! Please, please, pretty please... Where do you suppose Eva is? She'll come back. Maybe I should ask my neighbor if he saw anything... Maybe she left a note. Or maybe she's down at the corner bar. Your piano has a sluggish action and a dull tone. Yes, but it's better than no piano at all. If I didn't have it, who knows what would've become of me. Come on up here! You can't even make enough to get our things out of hock. Bastards! Come on, show us your garbage dump. Go on shitface! Here! Here's a little crown for our little queenie. End of the dumping. Eva, get up. Don't be afraid, it's me, Bruno. Don't worry. I made you some tea and brought you some cookies. Here, take it. Take it, Eva. Drink a little, at least. What happened? Eva? Don't ask, Bruno. Two pounds of grapes and... ...two pounds of tangerines for Eva. If it ain't our creepy piano player in creepy person. Play! Now turn around a little, round and round. Now up you go. Kneel down. Kneel down, I said! Come on, come on. Where's my whip? Kneel, you bastard. Head down, say your prayers. Hands out in front, knees up. Stick those hands out in the direction of Mecca. You live down in Turk Town, don't you? - Answer me! - Yes. - Louder! - Yes! Bravo! Keep your noodle straight. Yeah, that's right. Here's number two... Hey, what do you think you're doin', you old nut? So, that about takes care of the most important item... You just stay like that now, you hear me? I hear you. - Louder! - Yes! Bravo. Don't let it get you down, Bruno. It'll be all right. You can come anytime, even in the middle of the night if you have to. Except Tuesdays and Thursdays, when I have to be at the jail infirmary. You say your girl's run away from you again... ...and that you don't know how to defend yourself. You spent years of your life in homes... ...and they don't teach you that there, I know. You should get yourself a steady job. Singing in the courtyards is probably not the right thing. Look, Bruno, we'd be a lot better off in this world of ours... ...if we knew the answers to all your questions. I ask myself so many questions, too, about my own work, because... ...there are so many things that disturb and bother me. We simply know so little about human beings. Let's go over to the premature ward, I want to show you something. You see, Bruno, we doctors have a lot of problems... ...that we can't solve, questions we have no answers for. Look at this baby, born prematurely... ...and how strong its grip reflex is. And maybe some day... ...this baby will even become President. - We ought to call the police. - What do you think? Maybe it would be better if I went to the police? - No. - No? We'll go away from here, Bruno. I'll stay by you, I won't run away any more. Good. Where is Wisconsin, anyway? I don't think it's on there. Here's North America. Here's Wisconsin, it's right near Canada. Bruno's much too old for this. Look at my head, the way my elbow's starting to shine through. But I'm much older than you, and I'm going over. Anyway, if you want something, you're never too old. You're never too old. And if we don't like it, we can always come back. We could give it a try. Look, here's Chicago, and New York, and California. Everybody makes money there, and we can, too. How are we going to pay for the trip, and the visas? We don't have that kind of money. I'll get it, don't you worry about that. Fucky-fuck? Yeah? How much? - How much you want? - Fifty. - Twenty-five. - Look. Fifty. - Thirty. - Fifty. Too expensive. - Fifty is cheap. - No, expensive. - Take a look. - Thirty-five. - Fifty, come on. - Thirty-five. What do you say now, Bruno? I earned all this. Well, blow me down. We're going to start all over again. Right, and it's about time. Berlin's been getting on my nerves. I've had some good news from my nephew. He says in his letter that you can work as an auto mechanic in his shop. Yes. And you can get a job as a waitress in a restaurant, Eva. It's a place like we have on the autobahn here... ...where all the truck drivers stop. - Sounds good. This is my nephew and his assistant, a red Indian. And as far as a place to live goes, he says... ...we can put up a prefabricated house. There's plenty of room. Eva, what kind of country is this... ...where they confiscate my Beo. He knows a sentence in German: "What's loose? The dog's loose." He was with the Air Force in Ramstein, that's when we met. It's called Railroad Flats, because of all the trains that come through. Clayton thinks that there are not only four but five murderers here. Because not long ago, a man drove his tractor out into the fields... ...and that was the last anybody ever saw of him. The police couldn't find any trace of him, either... ...so Clayton went out and bought a metal detector, because he thinks... ...the man and his tractor may be at the bottom of one of these lakes. And now he goes out every weekend to look for him. The lakes are frozen over now, so he can walk on the ice... ...to see if the tractor really is at the bottom. Clayton says to stay away from the fence... ...when those two farmers are out plowing. They've been fighting over that strip of land in between... ...and when one comes out, the other one does too... ...to make sure that neither one starts plowing that strip of land. Sooner or later they're going to start shooting at each other. I noticed already that they both carry guns... ...and they drive right past each other real close. There's even a bathtub. This is pretty marble. It's just wonderful. There's no water yet. Still know how? No. Oh for the country life, without storm or strife, where the billygoat... ...dances with his wife. All right, we've had enough dancing. I'm serious now. We have to get established, don't we? How do we do that? - Well, we've made it, Bruno. - Yeah, we've made it. Eva... ...do you like it? Very much. Greetings, gentlemen. I've made an important discovery about animal magnetism. May I be allowed to take a reading? I am sorry to have kept you. I have made an important discovery about animal magnetism. Would you allow me to take a reading? You see, the needle jumps. Now for this animal... The animal is cold, the needle does not register. Thank you for your assistance, and I wish you all the best. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. May I come in? - Hello. - Hello, Bruno. I have made a... Would you hold this, please? I've made an exciting discovery. Mesmer described animal magnetism... ...and I have at last found a way to measure it. For the first time ever. As a child, I already knew that one day... ...I should succeed in measuring this interesting phenomenon. But what is animal magnetism? Animal magnetism is today called hypnosis, a term perhaps... ...not entirely justified. That it is measurable may be seen from Schopenhauer's book... ..."On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Cause". Now I'm going to take a reading from you, Bruno. - You see? - Yeah, it really works. Now you, Eva. - Not as much as Bruno. - Why not? Bruno's more highly electrically charged, it seems. This may be a part of the lost tractor. What is it? Maybe it's in the pond. How are we going to pay for this? Stop it, Bruno. Stop? I just got started. I'm sick and tired of hearing it. The TV set, the house, and then those contracts... Yes. - All in English, and the small print... - I can read English all right. I thought America would be different, and we could get rich quick. Cut it out, Bruno, I can't listen any more, really. I've told you often enough that you can earn money here. It's no problem at all. I'll take care of it, you'll see. All right, you take care of it then. For sure. - Yes. - Okay. Eva, look at this. No measuring tape, no yardstick, no nothing. Right on the nose. - I can't see through you, you know. - Can you see now? Okay, all finished. Yes. Hello. Eva, it's the man from the bank. He says we have to pay the money... ...because we're so far behind. If we don't pay the installment, he takes the TV set. What did I tell you? There you go. It's all there in black and white. Don't worry, I'll take care of him. Don't you worry. He needs the money. Hey, Eva, where'd you get all that money? I just earned it. You don't make that much as a waitress. Where'd you get it? - Where do you think? - You made it somehow. Your visit was a pleasure and an honor. Thank you for your friendly visit. Here you see a schematic model I have made... ...of how it looks inside Bruno. They're closing all the doors on him, and oh, so, politely. Now we're in America... ...and I thought everything would be better and we'd reach our goal. But no. Bruno's getting pushed aside as if he didn't exist. You act as if you don't even know me anymore. Nobody kicks you here. No, not physically. Here they do it spiritually. - What do you mean? - In the reformatory... ...it was just like here. If someone wet his bed, this was under the Nazis... ...instead of hanging the sheet on the clothesline, they used to... ...make the person who did it, stand holding it up like this all day... ...and the teacher would stand behind him with a stick. And boy, if his arms started getting tired from standing so long... ...he got a beating. Now I'm going to sit down again. Did you have to do that too? They hurt you openly then... Today they do it differently. They don't go like this, or like this... They do it ever so politely, and with a smile. It's much worse. You can smell it in the air, and you can see it, too... Who knows what fate will bring? I can't understand you. Who knows what fate will bring? You never know. The prison doors... ...are wide open, and we're not in Germany any more. You've got to be careful here. - Don't be so bitter, Bruno. - Bitter? You don't want me to be bitter? When somebody despises me? When I'm grown up enough... ...to need to be loved? When I get shut out of the bedroom and can't sleep with you any more... ...and have to sleep by myself in another room, like in a cage. Bruno, listen to me. - I need to be alone sometimes. - You do? Right, when a person is writhing in pain, it hurts so bad. And that pain is a spiritual pain, it's deep inside. If you think you can get along on your own in America, go ahead. Listen, I've got to try to make you understand. I just have to be alone sometimes. I never had a room of my own. I really need it. And even if you sleep in the other room, we're still in the same house. We're not separated, we spend the whole day together. Well, then I just don't know what to say. I'm finished. Bruno's on the outside looking in. Stupid of him to ever have done it... ...coming to America, just to watch his whole world fall apart. I might as well be back where I came from. No... no. There's no hope. Where's Eva? What are you doing? Are you crazy? Get out of here! Go away! You want me to go away? I'm going to Vancouver with these guys... ...so bug off. Okay, I'm buggin' off. Have a seat. I can't say I know the language... ...but something smells mighty fishy to me. Here, so you don't have anymore sleepless nights. When are you dropping by to see us again? Goodbye. He wanted money. Money? She's gone, that contract about the installments... ...now he's hanging in the tree... ...and they'll throw him to the dogs. Here's the one that's gonna get thrown to the dogs, right here. You can't do this to us, gentlemen, I won't allow it. This is a conspiracy. I shall talk to my Secret Service friends. You'll see what happens to you. We're going to burn your fingers. We're going to put a stop to this vile conspiracy! They're all in this together. Every last one of them, including you is in this together. Ten, twenty-five... Oops, let's count it again. ...fifteen, twenty, twenty-two, thirty-two, come on... So you're in this too. May I ask who sent you? My last three dollars. I wouldn't worry about it. You said it. Absolutely. - Here's to ya. - Cheers.
