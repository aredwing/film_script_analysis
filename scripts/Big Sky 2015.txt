Goddamn it! Oh, good. You're awake. That makes one of us. I'm awake now, that's for sure. I stepped on my keys. Those little buggers can hurt! What were your keys doing on the floor of the upstairs hallway anyway? Oh, wait. Let me guess. Um, you dropped them last night mid-swig or mid-something else. You know, I did hear stu start to, um, moan. Yeah, like a man moan. Maybe we should ask him. He's not here anymore. We scared him off. Happy? And at least I have keys. At least I have use for keys. Just say the word, and these are yours. You packed. I washed your lucky shirt. Oh, and I, uh, I called them again. Double-checked about the ride. Uh, the van's windows will be tinted. The driver will never go above 55, on or off the highway. Barely even feel like you're moving. And You'll have the back row all to yourself. No one will even be able to look at you. It's just how you like it, right? Right? One... Half red, half blue. Half white and half red. Was that dad on the phone? Mm-hmm. While I was in the shower? Mm-hmm. And what did he say? Wanted to wish you a Bon voyage. What did you say? I told him you were in the shower. Oh, and that he and his new wife are festering boils that should be lanced from the ass of humanity. Good, right? You took only three, right? Of course. You want to check them? And If we're missing some, It's only 'cause stu boosted a few on his way out. His name is Steve Hayes, not stu. Sorry. So you were saying that she missed her graduation. Graduation, senior prom, junior prom before that... all of it. Anything to avoid another attack, huh? So the last one was when? Are you the driver or the doctor? Look, I'm just the guy who's trying to get your daughter from here to there, that's it. Uh, the last one was about six months ago. Six months. Tried going for a walk. About a minute in, she started to choke. And, um, along came shrink number four and prescription number seven. So now she's got her pills and her birds and her computer and me bringing meals to her room. So she won't eat down here? She won't come down here. She hasn't for months. Well, that kind of limits the social life, huh? Hazel doesn't have a social life. I was talking about you. No cuts, no scrapes, no nicks, no scratches. No cuts, no scrapes, no nicks, no abrasions. No abrasions. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it... Alone. Mm, I'm gonna need all distractions. I know, I know. Tunnel vision. I can do it. Seven more steps. Seven more steps. Seven more steps. Okay. So there's your air, all right? And there's your light, and that is your eject button, If at any point you just want to come out and join the party. That invitation's always open. Okay, Hazel? You're gonna be fine in there, Hazel. Snug as a bug. Nothing can touch you. I'll come with you, haze. How's that? I'll just come with you for the ride. Okay. Yeah, all good. On schedule. Right-o, jefe. You guys think of everything, huh? Oh, yeah, well, we don't fool around. Well, sometimes we do. Hey, uh, we got Eddie making a late-afternoon return run. He can bring you right back If you want. Oh, yeah? Next return-around is tomorrow morning, If you were wondering. I don't know. I'll keep that in mind, Mcdreamy. Right. Envision destination. Eliminate all distractions. You just can't sit still, can you? Look, Dee, seriously, It's okay. She's gonna love this place. You made the right choice. It wasn't a choice. Hazel just turned 18, so her dear dad stopped paying child support, and he and his new wife decided to hit us with the old "threats and ultimatums" move... selling our house, cutting off the checks until Hazel checks in, which will only set her back, believe me. That's optimistic. That's realistic. Do I know you? You look familiar. Oh! I kept worrying I'd go to, like, the exact wrong place. Hi. I'm Vicky. Hey. Damn, some of us are antsy. What, you've never been to a sanitarium before? Oh, sorry. Treatment resort. Continue on 22 west for 46 Miles. - You play golf, right? - Professionally? I did. I just lost my tour card. I stopped making putts, and I stopped eating meals. My agents think I can find both my stroke and my appetite in the desert. What about you? What do you do? World bank. Stressful gig? I bet. So, what are you trying to find out in the desert? Nothing. Just six days' peace. What about me? You guys want to know about me? Kleptomania. Careful shaking hands with a thief, mister. I got lightning fingers. Hey, you in front. Your turn. What's wrong with you? Nothing. At all. Come on, you've obviously got something. These shades for you? They were for my daughter. She's in the back there. Damn. I thought I had issues. Veer right in point-one Miles. Yeah, Bennett, we made the turnoff. Everyone's fine, Capitan. Yeah. Do you hike? I have lots of hiking stuff. Well, I don't know. These days I'm having enough trouble with trail mix, let alone actual trails. Would you mind? Jesus, relax, guy. You relax. That girl just stole a $15,000 watch. I didn't steal it. I was joking. Oh. Very funny. Ha-ha. You're just lucky I'm traveling unattended. Otherwise, your lightning fingers would be in pieces right now. Ooh! Big man! Who normally attends you? Is it Thor? Is it Wolverine? Does he normally attend you? No. Just somebody who would have no trouble pulverizing a child thief or her talentless, anorexic crush. Huh. Are you sure It's just six days of peace you're looking for in the desert? 'Cause I got to say, from the vibe I get, I have a much different read on your... Condition. I think you're just gay, and you're having a really hard time wrestling with your latent but potent urge to be bent over. - Excuse me? - Uh, guys? Why don't we, uh, try getting a head start on that whole "explore serenity" thing now. Really, It's easy. Just go with the flow. No problems here, boss. I'm from Los Angeles. I don't have a problem If this guy's a queer. Watch your mouth. Nobody move! Shut up! Give me your phones! I said don't move! Don't you move! Don't move! Recalculating. Get down! Get down! I said get down! Don't! Come on! Get out of the van! Okay, let's go. I said go! - Come on! - Come on! Hey. Hey, don't wait on him. Schedule. Come on! Come on! Yeah. - Shut up! - You, shut up! - In the van! - Let's go! Recalculating... Mom? Mom? Recalculating... Mom? Mom? Recalculating... Mom? Mom? Oh, my God. Mom? Mom? Passed out. No. No, no. Recalculating... I don't understand. Who... who... Oh, your phone. We'll just call someone. We can call for help, and... they took 'em. All of 'em. Um... Maybe they have a-a first... Okay. Okay. Dressing. Is it... Is that... Is that okay? I'm sorry, all right? Really, I am. I know... I know... I know what you're gonna say... "spilled milk. It's over." But I just want you to know that I'm really, truly sorry. Yeah, you're sorry? Yeah. You're sorry? Yeah. I'm sorry. Why? You know why? Why? 'Cause I bought blanks, Pru, and I was a second away from putting 'em in your piece, but I didn't because I thought, "what If the driver tags Pru? I'll never forgive myself." That chick, she just started laughing. Why was she laughing? She was in shock. Pruitt, she was in shock. People do strange things when they're in shock. They laugh. Like ha, fucking ha. You know that. We got what we went for, though, right? We came for a girl, not a girl and four dead bodies. We're not bad guys, Pru. We don't wear black hats. I told you, just like I told you to stay calm, man. Don't lose your shit. Don't be a spastic! Pru... Pruitt, I'm sorry. You know I don't mean to call you that. I'm sorry. You know everything I do... You do for me. Like Bryan Adams. Except... Except he doesn't have a brother. Doesn't have a brother. Two males, two females. Driver was a male; Our girl with the curly hair. Everything matched. Did you get a good look at the one in front? No, no. The one with the hat? I was just looking at the hostage, like you said. I got to call him. I got to call him. No loose ends, right? Ever. Right. Turn left... Ohh. Um... Well, that's fort defiance, and It's only like... Five or six Miles away, so... I can go get help. I can go get help. No. Someone will come. U-turn... There are no cars around here, mom. I mean, why do you think they did what they did at this exact spot in this time? That's not one of your computer maps, haze. That's real desert out there. Real sand, real wild animals. Yeah, and a real reservation. Five or six Miles away! It would be hard enough If it were five or six yards. Thanks, mom. That's real encouraging. But I'm not helpless. No. I-I'm doing this. - You think we wanted to? - We had to. They got wild. They charged. I shot first. Yeah. He did fine. He did fine. All four others. Look, I'm not happy about it either, but what's done is done. That's not why I've been trying to get you. I need to know about the girl. No, not the hostage. The other girl. You have arrived at your destination. Okay, um, you have mace in your purse, right? Mom, what... What's this? It's probably Steve's. I didn't know it was there. And I'm the one who needs help? Here. Take this. It's important. I always thought I'd die quickly. I don't know why. Heart attack or a stroke. In a Walmart. Among the frozen foods. Mom, I... Please, I already told you, I'm not listening to some stupid goddamn deathbed speech, okay? I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna come back, and... And I... I'm just gonna have to do it tunnel-style. Just gonna look at my feet and-and-and eliminate all distractions. It'll be fine, and I promise I'm coming back. I can't. I can't. One, two... You're gonna be fine. You will. It's just... Jesse thinks you might have a fever. But he's... He's super careful. He's careful, and he's caring. Takes care of me. He always has. We have the same mom, but she had him when she was way younger. He's, like, part brother, part dad. He's... He's my "Brad." Mom, though, she wanted me to be a girl. That's why she hit me in the head with a gravel rake. Made me, um... Hmm? When Jesse found out, he... He told her, "don't you ever touch him again." You got no one to care about you, huh? Is that wh... Is that why you steal cans of goya beans even though your dad's got, like, 600... $600 million? Huh? Well, it is necessary. Very. Right. Yeah. I'm caring too. And honest. And professional. Hey! Get off her! What the hell are you doing? I was just... you were just what? You were just what? You were just acting unprofessional. Again. Again! You wrap her up and get ready to move out, understand? Right. Safe house further on. We're gonna make a couple of stops first, get more sedative. We're going back to the van, Pru. Wait. We're... We're going back... Yeah, we're going back to the van. I worked it out. We make another return If I drive fast tonight. I need you to follow me, pruitt. None of this bullshit, you understand me? Look at me. She got agoraphobia, in the front seat. What was she doing in the front seat? She was afraid of all this space. Shouldn't have been in the front seat. Do this. Now, why do we need a stronger sedative? Because when the hostage starts to squirm, so does everyone else. Good. And the kerosene? So that no matter what's there when we arrive, nothing's there when we leave. Good. Mm-hmm. You take your pills? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Okay, th... This morning, I just got so revved up, 'cause I was ready, and I couldn't even think about taking my pills. You take your goddamn pills. No. What? It's the same as 35 degrees longitude. The sun is about 70 degrees above. That makes this one my right road. Definitely. - That was something jaunty - To get your day going. Now how about something a little more melancholy? Here on "classical gas." Can't really handle Mozart right now. Turn right. End destination. You have... you have... u-turn. U-turn. U-turn. U-turn. U-turn. Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! God! Oh, God! Shit! Come on, Lyle. Give it to me. Oh, yeah. And it feels good? Oh, yeah. It feels good? Oh, Lyle, that doesn't feel good. Don't you think we should take it a little slower? Please, Lyle, get off! Damn it. No cuts. No abrasions. No infections. No nicks. No slashes. Okay. Okay. No cuts. No abrasions. No infections. No nicks. No slashes. I'm okay. Pill time. Oh, It's dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Okay. Right. Okay. I wish they made these things smaller, you know? What are you doing? Put it down. Put it down. We're gonna need guns again, right? "Need"? Yeah. Looks to me like you want a gun, and you should never want a gun, Pru. I know. All right. Let's make some time, yeah? Come on, come on, you've got to do this. You've got to get out of here. How do you do it, little birdie? How do you manage? How would you do this? Last? Okay. Okay. Forget about... Forget about the destination and only think about steps. Find your route. The cactus. Okay. All you have to do is get to the cactus. Get to the cactus 150 yards away. Each step you take is closer to the cactus. To the cactus. 150 yards, next cactus. All you have to do is get to the next cactus. "Why mom hates me." My attitude. "I'm not as strong as she is." "Sometimes I make her feel dumb." "What I did" "or didn't do." Just topical anesthetic, haze. Oh, God! Hello. - Stay calm, yeah? - Hello? Control. Always in control. Hey, check it out. Did you leave this open? Son of a bitch! I knew it! I knew it. What kind of a wacko needs to be in a cage to take a drive? Think she got a ride? No one comes out here. She ran. Question is, where? Where? Ah, damn it. Maybe these footprints would help. Oh, God. Keep moving. Keep going. No stops, just steps. The next cactus is, um, 100 feet, so that's just 100 feet closer to help and 100 feet closer to mom. Eliminate all distraction, envision destination. Tunnel vision. It's okay, okay. This is wrong. Very wrong. It's way too steep, and you know it. I'm not listening to you. I'm shutting you out and shutting you up. Approach the drop. Take half-steps down about 200. Avoid crapping your pants. Why won't you listen? Because you're just a mirage, okay? And a mirage is just a... A reflected light, right? How far you think she got? Oh, no more than a half mile. Girl had issues, remember? Mm-hmm. You know, I'm thinking maybe you stay back here, Pru. What? Yeah. What are you talking about? You don't want me to come with you? No. This'll be quick. I'll be right back. You don't want me to come with you? No, I was just... It's gonna be quick, you know? I'll be right back. I have skills. I'm a better shot. You know it. I know it. I know. But we just need to keep this situation controlled. Controlled. Pru... All right. Go ahead. You know your orders? Right? You're in control. Secure perimeter. All right. It's okay. I know. I'm coming. I'm coming. Almost there. Walking and I'm talking. I'm walking... Walking... Walking... What? Oh, my God. This is good. Oh, yeah. Got to be faster. Got to be faster. Got to be faster, pruitt. Too slow. We have, um, spinach. I don't like spinach. It's such an ugly color. It's so... dark. You got lucky. Super lucky. Getting down here, in here. But be careful, because after good luck comes bad luck. Oh, please just stop it. Oh, my God. Just go away. I'm just trying to help. That's all. Everyone needs help. Please don't do this. Please, I'm begging you. Gracie... Come on. That was never supposed to happen. Hello? Oh, well, just fuck me twice. It's you. I mean, you're, like, a person. Like, a real, live person, not a bat or a cat or a... vision. I thought maybe... Hey, you're not a vision, right? You're not Evie's ghost? Here to give me more fucking shit. I came out here with my bike, see? Then I heard something. And then I came, and I saw something... a car in the rocks this way, and spooky. Then there's you in the car, so... coincidence or a sign? You have a bike? Triumph bonneville 750. I was riding... just a little desert ride... collect my thoughts, I have this vision, and I got a little, I don't know, out of my way. It's cool, though, 'cause, uh, every destination is really just another exit ramp, right, on the highway of existence. Huxley said that. Aldous Huxley? Doors of perception? Brave new world? No? Is your bike close? Jesus, don't any of you fucking people read anymore? But you were saying... About your bike? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just, uh... It's over there. Um... You see, I'm sort of, um, enclosed here. But maybe you could go on your bike and get someone for me? Get someone for you? I-I-I don't do errands. See, I'm bigger than errands. Now, If you want a ride, If you want to... If you want to give our minds the chance to fuse, I'll take you anywhere you've got to go. So, what do you say? Ah, so. Come here. You're so fucking slow. If she got picked up, we'd have heard by now. She's out here. Somewhere. - Give it just a little - More time, okay? Then get braids to the house. She's our focus. Right. Listen, once braids pays off and we get some cash, why don't you get that cough fixed? Hey, I wouldn't wish valley fever on a desert rat. You've got it. Where are you, little girl? Aldous huxley... I don't care what anyone Says. I don't care what Evie said. He was the absolute shit. I mean, check it out. On his deathbed, dude's dying of, like, cancer or scurvy or something, he asked for the single greatest hit of LSD ever administered to a single human being. Ever. No shit. True story. I could, you know, If you want, sometime I could... I could read you some huxley. Check it out. Raven. Raven. Uh, mister? I'm in a really big hurry. I've got, like, a really big, major emergency. Ah. I know. Stay right there! I'll shoot! I will! Move one inch, and you're dead! What do you want me to do? Just tell me what to do! Um, mister? We're really running out of time here. I know. My mother... please, we can't waste one more second. I know. I know. I'm helping you. I'm generous. You should know that about me. If we're gonna, you know... Please, your bike... where is it? Right here. What? Right... here. Wh-what is that? Triumph bonneville 750. That's your bike? Well, when I stopped, I gave her a little going-over, you know? Some minds, they just... They won't be contained. What? I can put her back together. I took her apart, yeah? So I can put her back together, easy. Wait. Just wait, okay? I'm... I'm helping you. I'm a big person. A thinker. Huh? Why the fuck are you pulling this shit on me anyway? Huh? What the fuck, huh? Oh, now I get it. Right. Donny put you up to this. Huh? What? Donny Benji, Evie's fat-fuck brother. What are you talking about? Listen. Listen. I didn't touch her. Do you people understand? She fell, okay? She fucking fell. I never even wanted to live on the sixth floor. I never wanted the fucking terrace. She wanted the fucking terrace so she could get a fucking tan and look like Farrah fucking Fawcett, whoever the fuck that is. Now, do you get that? Do you fucking get that? Shut up. Shut... Shut up. I come out here to get away from people like you, people chasing after me with all this Evie shit. You people think you can get me? Well, you can't. You fucking can't. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fucking burns! I hit the ball like an egg, Gracie. Cut calves. Herds. What do you mean, cut? - Not literally, - Like, with a knife. But he kept the calves from going to the other side... But I don't know If you can ride a horse... I don't know If you can ride a horse... Well, I think we can get him... All right, hawkeye. My wide-ass, excitement. If that's excitement, I'm playmate of the year. You mean to tell me you got that kind of action back in Hoboken? - "Action"? Actually, - Yes, we did. We can't just stay like this, you know. Then give me your phone. I told you already, I don't have one. Come check for yourself. My brother has one. He's on his way back, but... I don't think he's gonna want to give you anything. Are you okay? You don't look so good. I'm sorry I shot you. I am. But you shouldn't have laughed like that. At the GPS. You... You shouldn't have done that. That's it. That's the one I want right there. Right there. Baby! Hey, she's up. Mm. Are you okay? You've been out for a little while. And you're all dinged up. I was, uh... I was out with my metal detector looking for scrap, and... - "scrap"? - More like trash, senor scavenger. Yeah. I heard a scream. I saw you way over there on the ground. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, miss. Settle back down. Best thing for a concussion, If that's what you've got is just to lay back for a while. Your smack-head pal's in the trailer next door with rod's cousin, rinsing his eyes out. Please tell me that's not your boyfriend. No. Seriously, hon, I don't judge, but you really shouldn't be using that junk. You use junk, you meet junk... I was, um, in a van about five or six Miles up, and we were in a terrible... Trouble. Really, I was... I was trying to reach fort defiance. Fort defiance? What? Well, you found it. Glamorous, eh? Regular wild-west kingdom, with a chariot out back. I don't need a chariot. Just a car. Hon, you okay? Hon, come on. Don't worry, miss. We made the call. Cops are on the way. They should be there soon. Yeah, they never hear about any craziness on the Rez. They always just jump right on their horses and come and save us. Especially with hustler rod. Can you, uh... Can you close the windows? Please? They're closed, hon. It's okay, miss. The sky's our friend, and the sand is our friend too. And man? I don't know If man is our friend. - Don't listen to him. - Listen to me. You're gonna be all right, hon. Hell, we even got guns in back. Rod'll shoot anything for you for a price. He may not hit it. You said you were in a van? White? From the facility? Well, maybe it was reincarnated. Pull over! Pull over! I got to stop them! Hello? Hello? Be careful. No, we have it here. If you can just check on the officer. Thank you. Okay. They're checking with sergeant Desoto. Miss, we're gonna have to move. You understand? Yeah, maybe I should go with. I can't allow anybody in the van. It's protocol. But you've done more than enough, believe me. We'll follow, just to see her get with her mom. Hey, rod's not gonna scavenge the site, I promise. Hey, hon. You're gonna be all right. Yeah, we're gonna... excuse me... we're gonna have to go. Thanks. Thank you again. Okay, Hazel. They just flagged sergeant Desoto. I told him his happy hour would just have to wait. Two men, you said? Machine guns and masks? I swear. Yeah, when you guys didn't show up, we were thinking it was a flat or a flight delay or a panic attack at worst. Lyle sometimes likes to turn off his cell phone so we don't bug him. And you're sure he's dead? I saw it. You know he used to call me Capitan and jefe like he was joking. Your mother, at least... You were saying she was still alive? Well, I... I left her alive. It'll be okay, Hazel. It'll be fine. Breathe, Hazel. You want something to eat? I have a snack in my pocket. I could get it for you. Uh, I was just getting a snack. Me and Jess, we're not bad guys. We don't wear black hats. The opposite, actually. You know? So like I said, I'm sorry I shot you. I really hope that you don't hold it against me. Okay? Can I ask you something? Do you? Do you hold it against me? I'll tell you what. I've been sitting here all day in my own blood, flies on me, bullets in me, sharing a van with three dead people who were talking to me this morning, and I haven't for one second thought about you shooting me. No joke. Not one single second. What I have thought about... all I've thought about... is my daughter, who's out there somewhere, please God, moving okay, breathing okay. So... So to address your concern about what you've done to me, no, I won't hold it against you. But what you've done to my daughter... what the hell are you doing? Jesse, she's alive, and she's got a gun. Did you take your goddamn meds? Jess, I did. Front seat. No one's alive. Front seat! Put that gun down! Drop that gun! No! Blanks? Pru, you know I had to. You put blanks in my gun? Get out of my way! I can't believe you'd put blanks in this gun! What where you thinking? Goddamn you, get back! Jesus Christ, I can't believe you did that! Hey! What's going on here? We're assessing the situation. No, no, no! Don't listen to him! Get back in your vehicle. He's lying! I'm not lying. Hey, mister! Please! It's Dee, right? Yes! Yeah, I'm here to help you. These men aren't! We're in danger! All right, Dee. I'm gonna come over and take a look at you. Me, not the officer. He's not an officer! - Yes, I am. - Just shoot him! Dee, just let me help you. No, I can't! Help me! Watch that gun! No! No, he's lying! He's lying! Haze? Get back in the van! No, no, no! Stop! You, get back in the van. All right, Dee. Just let me help you. What we're gonna have to do is clean this all up. Broom it. No! Oh, God. Oh, God. Rod! Baby! Baby, you okay? Goddamn, girl, you're a good shot. I'm s... I'm sorry. - Mom? - Haze! Ma? You okay? Uh-huh. It's okay. We made it. You made it. You were with me the whole way. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's a start. Right? Yeah. Yeah, It's a start. Okay. It's okay. It's okay? Are you sure? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? Stay here.
