No, I'm calling Granny. What if I give you this? Then you can play doctors. Hello, yes. She still has fever? No, that's not normal. Come right over and I'll fit you in. That's a pretty baby... Be right back. You can get dressed. Hi, Cathy! Sorry, just some joker. You can't come? - What'll you do? - Nothing. That's a sad Christmas Eve. No, Manu, I'll buy in a gourmet TV dinner and I bet it'll be one Zen Christmas. As you like. Happy Christmas! Hi, it's me. What's the story? Almost done, and you? I'm done. Well, almost... Sorry, I forgot. Come on in. Hi, girls! You know the way. Be right there. - So, got the presents? - Presents? - Shit, I forgot. - Christ, Philippe! I told you a thousand times! I know. I'm really sorry. Sure, see you in a bit. - Isa, how's it going? - Okay. nd you? Running late forgot the presents. Why don't I get them and you get Marine at the crche? Paris is crazy! I'll never make it. Okay, fine. See you at Mom's. Don't forget her teddy! Do I ever! Big kiss bye. - Change of plan, crche duty. - Fine. Bravo for the wine, my nephews will love it. Good it cost a bomb. - I'm useless with kids. - Never a kid yourself? No, or I've forgotten. Yeah, sure... Come on.. . Stop being a grouch. Let's say hello. Watch out! Fuck! And the phone has to ring. Yes, Mrs. Berger... - Are you blind! - You handle it. That's all I need! - You okay? - No, I'm not! Sorry, we're totally in the wrong. Don't worry we'll make a declaration. It's a bit late... Just get the medicine up front... - Where is it? - What? - The insurance form. - I dunno! No, Madam, I wasn't talking to you. Happy Christmas.. . Yes, goodbye. Quick, the crche is closing. I'm so sorry. I got my insurance documents the other day but as I'm moving, I've mislaid them. Must be in here somewhere. Listen, we're running late. So I suggest we do the declaration another day. Better still, have your car fixed then I pay you and save my bonus. Okay? Here's my card. Thanks. Wait! Here's my number. Great, so I'll be hearing from you. I'm really sorry. Goodnight. Better hurry. Hi, everybody! At last! Hi, scallywags! Uncle Philippe! Hi, buddy. - How was her day? - Alright, but... I better check that fever. How's my favourite! Great to be here. - Suzanne, like a drop? - No, thanks. Here you take her I'll go get her dessert. Isn't she cute? Don't bother him, I'll take her. No, Mom he's fine. He has to learn. I think she just.. . Sorry, she's not well. No problem. Look, my pet. She's not well, she's all hot. It was nice, but I drank too much. You okay? I want a child, Philippe. Must we talk about that? Yes, I think we must. No, I'm exhausted I'm going to bed. I filed for adoption last summer. A social worker will be visiting in the new year. Are you serious? Yes, I am. You could've told me. Why? You'd have said no. We don't have the right to adopt. Unless I pass myself off as a straight single. So, what do I do? You just move out for the visit. A few days at the most. All worked out! Kids all day adorable nephews what more do you want? I just want to be a dad. Manu, we're gay! So we can't be parents? - Right. - Why not? Two men can't have a baby, it's not natural. Nonsense! Think of the kid, with two dads? We talked about this. It'll be clear I'll be the dad. - And you'll be... - Nothing at all! I don't want a child, get it? Your sister and hubby who never go out, who've stopped living... It scares me. I'm 40 and I still want to live. Well, I'm 42 and tired of living for our petty pleasures. I'm sick of it I want something else. So, I'm asking you now, once and for all if one day you see us with a kid. You and me yes or no? Sorry, but it's no. Morning. I've been thinking it over... I'm going ahead with the adoption request. Fine. Philippe, it's vital for me. Philippe! It's crazy! The only stable couple I know and you're splitting. It's hopeless! Why stay with a guy with no plans? You could've waited, talked it over. We did, but he's set in his ways. I'm getting old tired of wasting my time. You're telling me! Well, I think it's all there. Fine. Don't want to check? I trust you, thanks. Don't thank me, I ran into you. True. Then I won't thank you. That's better. Where are you from with that charming accent? Argentina. I studied design here for three years and now I want to live here. It's tough with no work permit but I manage. That's why I kind of "forgot" to reinsure my car. I get it... Willies are out! They're everywhere! The sports paper... Perfect! The Greek Myths... The Greek Myths? I'm a doctor, a paediatrician. I chose this speciality, as I love children. I always wanted to have kids but so far, it hasn't been possible. And as time goes by I feel an increasing need to be a father. In fact, it's quite normal. Why not do this with a woman? Let's say, my personal history has led me to be single and I don't want to base my future life on the hope of a possible meeting. Very well... Shall we visit? Let's go. This is the kitchen, with all the basic appliances, dish-washer, cooker, fridge... She's my ex. We're still good friends. Associates too, we share the same surgery. Shall we go on? So, this will be the child's room, I hope... For now it's a laundry, but I'll totally redo it. It has its own bathroom, in there. Take a look. And it gives onto the courtyard. Cool in summer. Well, you've seen it all except the upstairs bedroom... After you! I'll be giving your request initial approval and you must consult a registered doctor and psychologist from this list here. Wonderful. So then, I'll be hearing from you? You will. Goodbye, Mr Bernier. Goodbye, thank you. Hello? Cathy? Someone's at the door. Call you back. Yes? It's Mrs Charpentier! Sorry, we forgot the photocopies. Of course, come in. I'll go get them. There you go. I think it's no longer necessary. Sorry? You know perfectly well. Damn! Mrs Charpentier, wait! We were drunk, he's a friend and totally straight. Dammit! Think I enjoy this humiliating farce? I can be a good father. Straight or gay, what matter? Our job is to take every precaution for kids already traumatised. But I'm a paediatrician I know how to bring up a child! That's not for me to say. We have clear instructions. Listen, you could forget you ever saw that photo. For you, it's just a signature. But for me, it's my whole life. I beg you! I can't do that, Mr Bernier. I'm sorry. France will change fast on such issues. Who'd have imagined that holy old Spain would authorise gay adoption and marriage? You'll soon have the same problems as us all marriage, kids, even divorce. What if we had a baby together? Don't be silly. In university, one night, you told me: "If I'm single at 40, you can father me a child." Was I drunk? Face facts, that biological clock is ticking... So I'm making my formal request: Will you have a child with me? Please, Cathy? Nice to think of me, but no. But why? It'd mean I'd given up on loving some man who'd father my child. Well, I haven't. But think about it. If I were you I'd seriously consider having a child with an old gay friend you really know than some guy you don't, if you meet him - which isn't sure, nor that he wants kids - and who'll most likely up and leave you. I sometimes wonder if your company doesn't just drag me down. And as a doctor you know age can cause problems of fertility, Down's syndrome, malformation... Enough! Eat your dessert and see yourself out! - Promise to think about it? - I have! That crche breeds germs! He's really chesty, he'll need an x-ray! Every weekend we set him right only to get sick again! He needs an iron tonic. Do you hear? It's more a dry cough. No, it's loose. How'd you know? Are you a doctor? He's my son, I know. Your son? I'm up with him every night! And I never see to him? Yeah, five minutes, and you fall asleep! Hello, this is Emmanuel Bernier. Sorry? Remember? The car? Right, how are you? Fine, thanks. I was wondering how you were getting on? Pretty good... Nice of you to call. It's only normal, I was wondering if perhaps... we could meet up... Maybe for dinner? Okay... Why not? How about.. . tonight? I met him at design school. We were living together. Even planned to get married. But it wasn't to be, we split up two months ago. No need to look so down, that's life. What about you? You've got me talking, but I still know nothing about you. Me? Not much to know. I'm a doctor, a paediatrician... That's about it. And apparently single? Let's say I've... recently split up. And why? Without being indiscreet. Over time our needs grew different. I see. Well, I don't really. But what matter. My partner didn't want children. Excuse me. I'm really sorry. No need to apologise. On the contrary. Indeed, that's kind of why I called you. Let me explain. I felt that... you and I might have common cause. Basically I thought I could marry you and in exchange you'd agree to have my baby. Wow! Never heard that one before. That your usual chat-up line? No, not at all! I'm so stupid. I forgot one important detail. In fact, I'm gay. Homosexual. But you just said your partner didn't want kids? Partner, as in boyfriend. The idea is, we marry, you get citizenship and in exchange, you surrogate mother my child. I mean, for the conception, we don't have to... We can work it out. You hand over the newborn, we divorce and that's it. So, what do you say? Fina, this is Emmanuel. I wanted to apologise. I was really crass and horrible last night. I hope you'll forgive me. I'm really sorry. Big kiss, hope to see you soon. Bye. Sandrine and Charlotte seek two caring dads.. . altruistic and energetic.. . Hobby: rock 'n roll... No, thanks! Versailles, lesbian couple, seek dad, Paris region... Hobby: praying... Amazons 75: lesbians seek genitor, possible long term.. . Yes, speaking. Now? Okay, I'll be right over. Inspector Cambourache? I'm Mr Bernier. You called. Yes, take a seat. So, then. Here we are. The said Josefina Parades was stopped in an uninsured vehicle with an expired residence permit. She claims she lives with you, her fianc. Do you confirm this? Yes, I do, totally! That's right. Sorry, I said the first thing I could think of. Not to worry. That way, I'm half forgiven? So, where do I drop you? Well, in fact, I was staying with a friend but her guy's back from Argentina. There we go. The bathroom's here. And here you'll find all you need towels, sheets and so on. Thank you. I'll leave you be. Unless, you'd... like a bite to eat? I'm starving. Well, while you're calming down I'll see what I can find. See you in a bit. Pignas? Pignonas? Pignetas? Pignones. Pignones, there we go. Food at last. Thank you. Don't worry, I'll leave tomorrow. Do I look worried? My favourite! What'll you say if the cops come asking? I dunno.. . That we had a row. That you left. And vanished into thin air. But, if you want to stay longer... the time to find your feet, it's possible. It's a big house. And it looks like I'll be staying single. So... Welcome. Cheers! No cause for worry... See? His growth curve is well above average. A fine, healthy baby. Thank you. Excuse me. It's me. - Me? - Fina! Oh, sorry. I can't find the glue . Got any? Cupboard near the stairs, middle drawer. Great! So, any plans for tonight? Tonight? Nothing special. Maybe eat together? I'll call you back. Out or at home? Fina, I'm consulting. Sorry, didn't realise. See you later. Where was I? A fine, healthy baby! Sorry, I'm not very talkative... Odd, seeing you again. But also a pleasure. So, how are you? Fine. No offence, but... you rarely call back. I'm very busy, I go out a lot. I'm living. Great. You don't seem in any hurry to get your stuff. I rented furnished. So what do we do? About what? The house, the lease, the appliances, the furniture? Keep it all. But we bought most of it together. You heard, keep it all. Are you sure? At least take the car. And the painting? To hell with the car. We'll see about the painting. I never thought it'd come to this. Listen, Manu. This whole thing was your doing. So take the rap and quit calling me! Hi, there! Okay? Yeah. What're you writing? A job letter. Can I see? It's not finished. Let's have a look. I see. "On the strength of my job experience and internships, "I feel I can bring real added-value to your company." Too pretentious? I knew it. So, let's see. "An element of..." What? "I feel I can bring your company an element of... Meaningless, but perfect. I've got it... "Fantasy, creativity, "and total motivation." It's great! I did an internship at Renault, on the new Twingo. It was great. I worked on the new textiles, the design of the accessories, the switches.. . A baby needs its mother. So initially, it'll spend more time with us. "Initially"? I dunno.. . I guess, four, five years. So, all you want is a genitor. You're not looking to co-parent a child... Nature says it takes a mommy and a daddy. We agree. But one has to make concessions... We are women. We can easily get pregnant, whether or not we get on with the man. I worked at the Moulinex design bureau on home appliances.. . food-processors, scales, fryers. You want to raise the child in Belleville? It's great for kids. It confronts them with the world of the future. - Multi-ethnic... - Of course. It's fascinating, kids from all cultures. - It's a mix of... - I'm just a bit wary. I'll be frank. So for the child, Belleville is a problem? Yes, I don't really know the neighbourhood. Take a wander, it's interesting. Indeed... You did? Yes, that's the problem. My friend's a gynaecologist, she can help. Why bother? Natural is best. By insemination? No man and woman. Just close your eyes. We'll see. Why not? It'd be a lot easier. Why bother with syringes? We just go natural. No sorry, no way. - You're so biased. - Biased! Yeah, hung up. I just like to be told. I'm telling you now. That's my feeling. Why get up in a heap? If you want a child you just go for it. - And see... - Right. Personally, I'm up for it. It wouldn't bother me. If you agree? Hi. You okay? Well? Nothing to write home about. It's normal I guess. It's like dating... It'll take time before I meet a couple I can feel comfortable with or close to. How was your day? Had a really good interview in a start-up design studio. That's great. And guess what? They loved your letter! Well, that's something. See you tomorrow. Goodnight. You'll be alright? Yes. Don't worry. Goodnight. Manu... Wake up. I've got to talk to you. Are you crazy? At this hour? Listen, I've been thinking. I'm ready to have your baby. We'll talk about it later. I gotta sleep. Okay. What was that? You heard. But why? I want to help you too. Hold on. You realise what you're saying? Of course. Before, I didn't know you but now I'm sure you'd make a great dad. I think this is getting way out of hand. No, not at all. I've my whole life before me, I know I can do that for you. There's just one condition. I'd like a real wedding, for my parents. So they won't worry for me. - No way! - Why not? I won't be party to slavery! Come on, we're two consenting adults. She's doing it as a friend. Separating mother and child. Attacking the heart of nature! Misogynist! We could manage, but she'd prefer if you did it. I can't inseminate surrogate mothers, it's not legal! No one'll know. What's illegal about helping a married couple have kids? Come on, Cathy. Do it for your old buddy. - Damn you. - You're great. So, what's the next step? Full check-up on you both: blood tests, Chlamydia, semen analysis, etc. And of course, AIDS . Great! When do we start? Taking a holiday? Yes, next week. It'll do you good. - Call me in two weeks. - Fine. Thank you, goodbye. Hello. Are you Fina? This way. Manu? Hello. Bastard! Go on back to your whore! You swine! You're only hurting yourself. You have to move on, stop thinking of the past. Excuse me. Just a minute. What are you doing here? To say hello... and that Fina has moved in, as we're getting married for her work permit. She's also agreed to bear me a child. Insane. Why tell me this? I don't want you imagining things. I won't. I don't give a damn. Philippe... What can I say? You dump me for a total stranger to have a child. Gay dad meets homeless Peruvian... Argentinean. Fine! Go on back to your breeder, crazy bastard. Why does everyone think I'm crazy? All I want is a child! Wanted to see me? Fancy a drink? Why don't you sit down? Need to talk about your tests. I'm worried. Is there a problem? Is it Fina? Don't say I've got... The AIDS test was negative. Then, what? You can't have kids. What do you mean? You've got a zoospermia. What? It's impossible. You sure? What lab did you use? Girard.. . With a second analysis at Cochin. That's why it took so long. I'm really sorry. Yes? Why don't you answer the phone? Marine is sick, cries non-stop. Can't ask the baby-sitter. Could you mind her? Sure. We're dining with my boss. It's all in the bag, nappies, milk, baby-food, she hasn't eaten. Goodbye, my pet. Thanks. Say hi to Philippe. Have fun. My little girl is not well. Come with uncle Manu, we'll cry together. Let's have a listen inside. Here come the chilly tickles! Finished. See? Life isn't so bad after all. Come on, up! Three days of the blues, now you've got to act! How? I'm sterile and can't even adopt! You just need a genitor. A what? What do you mean? Like sterile couples do, ask family or friends for a little sperm. Sure but.. . it's kind of tricky. You dare ask me to have your baby but you won't ask for sperm? But from who? I'm really sorry. What do you intend to do? I don't know... Well, I do. Would you be willing to give me your sperm? Are you serious? Yes, totally. Philippe... Excuse me. Will you just listen! Hold on, dammit! I don't want kids, get it? It's just your sperm, I'll be the dad. Know what you're asking? Yes. That's why I can only ask you. And if you refuse, I'm giving up. Let's weigh you. Excuse me. That's okay. It's me, am I disturbing? I'm busy. Can I call you back? I'll be quick. I just wanted to say.. . I agree. Sorry? I agree to what you asked. But you're the prettiest baby in the world! For the kids. Careful, it's hot. Another? I don't recall your telling us about Fina? It's normal we just met. A few weeks ago. And how's Philippe? Fine, I think. You think? Philippe and I have split up. What a pity. Why is that? We'd been drifting apart for a while. But I also have some good news. Fina and I are getting married. Hope you're free for the party. Manu, it took us 15 years to accept you were gay and now you're getting married? Hold on, there's more. Rest assured, I'm still gay. It's just a marriage of convenience. So, that's the good news? No. I'm getting there. Fina has agreed to be the mother of my child. But I'll have sole custody. Even though we'll stay in touch, if the child wants to meet its mom. I didn't understand. He's getting married to a surrogate mother. What's a surrogate mother? A surrogate mother is... Why don't you guys go play? Scoot! Have you lost your mind, or what? You realise what you're asking? Won't be the first child raised by its dad. Dammit, you always say what counts is love! Love with no female referent? The female referent! - What'll you tell the child later? - The truth! That his dad so wanted him he found a woman and a man to make it happen. Another man? Well, Cathy did some tests and it turns out I'm sterile. So I asked Philippe to be the sperm donor. You're totally mad! We can't let them do this, say something! Come, pet. For the wedding, count me out! I'll go. Well, I think it's great news. I'm absolutely delighted. It's wonderful! Hi, there. Everything okay? What's the occasion? Nothing special. It's not my birthday, what's this? Open it and see. Be warned, I hate chocolates. I don't believe it. Are you sure? Yes. Really sure? Yes. I'm going to be a dad? I'm going to be a dad! I can't believe it! I'll be a dad! Thank you. What's the matter? I dreamt I had a malformed baby and you abandoned me. A common nightmare for pregnant women. You won't abandon me? No, don't worry. Back to bed. I'm scared down there. Can I stay a bit? Sure. Hop in. I'm shivering. I'm cold. Then snuggle up. I feel good with you. And you? Likewise. You what? Why? I dunno. That's wild. So, how was it? It was... That's wild. And... do you feel love for her? I don't know... I adore the girl. I find her touching. Even physically, I like her. You mean... you may be a closet straight? Don't be silly. Be right back. Cathy, everything okay? Yes, fine. Are you sure? It's too bright in here. Well, time to go. Don't want to stay a bit longer? We could chat. About what? I've told you all. It's late. Tomorrow's another day. You could sleep here. Too late for the metro. Cathy, I'm driving. Of course. Bye. Thanks for dinner. See you tomorrow. Can I have a word? I've really important news. I'm listening. Fina is pregnant. I'm really happy for you. Amazing, well done. I really wanted to thank you. And... also to tell you that... Carlos. Hi. Fina and I are getting married Saturday at 11 . Why not come along? It'd be nice. Both of you. There's no problem. Well, I won't keep you. Goodnight. I fell asleep. What time is it? You know... What happened last night was very sweet, very tender, but it can't happen again. You understand? Sure. There's Paris! How pretty. - That's Paris? - Yes, Dad. - Look at this garden... - It's beautiful. So, this is your room. - Looks lovely. - Yes, very pleasant. Darling, we're so thrilled to see you. We want to hear it all. How you met, how long you've been together. We want to know everything! What's the matter, darling? It's the emotion. What's wrong, my pet? Don't worry. Your mother couldn't stop crying on our wedding day. Yes, I remember. Mr Emmanuel Franois Xavier Bernier, do you take as wife Miss Josefina Maria Paredes here present? I do. Miss Josefina Maria Paredes, do you take as husband Mr Emmanuel Franois Xavier Bernier here present? Miss? Miss Paredes? I do. I hereby declare you husband and wife. The kiss. Long live the happy couple! Philippe! How are you? Glad to see you. It was getting a bit straight. Thanks. You okay? Glad you came. Don't jump to conclusions. I only came to please Mom. Right. I'm glad you came. Didn't think you would. Here I am. - How are things? - Fine. Well, you seem happy. I can't complain. You didn't come with your new boyfriend? No, he ditched me. Really? Why? He said I was... How did he put it? "Old" ... and "sinister" . No kidding! But maybe.. . he's not all wrong. No. Goodnight. Goodnight, Mrs Bernier. Not too late? Cute place you've got. Yeah... It's cute. I wish you every happiness, my darling. I'm so happy. He's so elegant, so well-mannered. And you, so radiant. My darling! And now... you give us pretty grandchildren! We will, I promise. Bon voyage. You'd better hurry. Bye. Hurry up! We'll be late. Bye. Safe home! Come on, quick! What's up with you? How could you do that on our wedding day? Under my parents, nose! Have you no respect? Get real. It was a marriage of convenience. You had to get laid the same night? No need to be gross. I didn't get laid, I saw Philippe again. But you said it was over? I thought it was. So? So... Philippe may be moving back in. What! And me? It changes nothing. You stay until the birth, like we said. We didn't say you'd flirt with your ex! - What does it change? - Everything! Fina, what is this? All you're short of is the rolling pin. Are you jealous? You guessed! Fina... Dammit! What's going on? Wanna know? Then I'll tell you! I've fallen in love with you. But I thought we'd made it perfectly clear? Sure. That's why we slept together. That day I was all mixed up. My joy at being a father, my gratitude to you... You're really special to me, believe me. But I'm gay and always will be. I was wrong, Manu. I can't have this baby without love. I'm sorry. I guess we really messed up. What do you want to do? We should put a stop to this. Don't you think? You may have tummy-aches and slight bleeding. But it's nothing serious, it'll pass. Okay? If not, call me. Okay. I'm sure it's for the best. Fina? What we'd like is to take the time and not rush into this. Right. See each other often, spend weekends together. Great. Make sure we agree on everything beforehand. Leave as little as possible to chance. Sure, chance is... We'd like alternate custody. Only problem is, we live in Orlans. Yeah... We noticed on the site. It's far. So in the interest of the child... Excuse me. I don't know if Manu told you, he'll be the dad, me too, I'm the genitor... It's me. Me? Who's me? Fina. Where are you? At the Bleuets clinic. I'm waiting for you, hurry up! At the Bleuets clinic? - Miss Parades? - Caps, please! Push, push... Great. Now rest. Hello. - You okay? - I'm thirsty. Quick, water. Contraction on the way. Open your mouth. Ready. Breathe in, hold it. Now push! Encourage her! I can't. You can. She can't. You're doing great. I can't. Be brave, Fina. You can do it. Ready, contraction! Deep breath, hold it. Push, push... We can see the head! Stop pushing! It's a little girl. A pretty little girl! Look, a little girl. You were great. She's so tiny... So tiny. Who's the dad? - He is. - I am. Chosen her name? For a girl I'd thought of Zlie. Yes, Zlie sounds nice. She's so tiny! Hi, I'm Manu. I'm your dad. And this is Philippe. He's your dad too. She looks so like you, it's incredible. She's got your nose, I swear. Can we do the paperwork? Here, you take her. Nice and easy. Mind her head. That's right. Me too, I'm your dad. And you're my princess. What a voice you've got. You'll be a singer. Easy does it. Can you walk okay? There he is! What's up? I'm not coming. I don't get it. You take Zlie and go home. - That was our contract. - Are you kidding? Our contract's over. Not for me. Listen, take your time. We go home, you rest up and we talk. No need. You go your way, I go mine. Don't be silly! You wanted her. I can't look after her, I've my life to live. I need to forget you. I don't understand. So why did you keep her? I don't know. For her. Please, don't make it harder. Just go. And promise not to look for me. I'll come to you, okay? Promise me. Now go. Go! I beg you. When you change her, put on these pyjamas. And if she doesn't sleep, do a 5/10/15... Let her cry for 5', go see her. Then for 10', go see her. She usually sleeps. If not, there's a problem. If so you must call me. Don't over-tighten the bottle, or it doesn't flow. But under-tighten and it spills. And check the milk on the back of your hand. I left you our mobile numbers. Plus our friend's mobile and her land line. Don't worry, she'll be fine. You reckon? Goodnight, princess. Don't forget to change her before bed. Come on, we're late! See you later, pet. And don't forget to burp her. Don't forget. Bye. I'll be quick, as I can't hear. I've no network. How's it going? Which wine? What do you mean, no burp? She has to burp, we told you! Okay, massage her tummy. And then tap her on the back. No, you tap her... Can't hear you, I'm hanging up. Red or white, Philippe? Pisses me off! We told her to burp her. Told her loud and clear. Nods her head, but doesn't listen. How'd you like the lamb? Rare? Shit! Did we tell her about Teddy? - I'll call back. - No. I'll do it. Laetitia, it's Manu. Did you remember to give her Teddy? You're an angel. Thanks. I'll let you go. We won't be long. See you in a bit. It's okay. She did it off her own bat. But she's so immature, it's scary. So... We tell her? Yes. Right. We were thinking... we'd be really happy if you'd agree to be Zlie's godmother. Something up, Cathy? Not happy? Yes, I am. It's just that... I don't understand. It should be me who... Yet here I am sitting pretty, while you two bugger away! It's just not fucking fair! Dammit! I enjoy contact with children. I always wanted to have kids, but so far it hasn't happened. And as time goes by I feel an ever deeper need. I guess it's quite normal. Why not do this with a man? Let's say, my personal history has led me to be single and I don't really want to base my life on the hope of a possible meeting. Fine. Shall we visit? This is the kitchen, small and functional, entirely fitted. Fine, perfect. Excuse me. My fault. The bedroom.. . Nice and bright. Next to the child's room. I hope. She's coming. There she is. She's so pretty. Wonderful. Isn't she just. Thanks for the outfit. Like it? The outfit? That we gave them. Where's Zlie's mom? Zlie's mom? She's gone. On a trip. - To America. - To Japan. To Japan. So we're looking after her. Drop of wine anyone? Sure, I'll have some. When's she coming back? Well, it's not.. . I don't know. Nor I. Kids, why don't you go play in the yard? Dad, it's snowing! - Make a little snowman. - A big snowman. Sleep tight, my beauty. Nighty-night... Goodnight, my pet.
