You know, sometimes we use art to ... express the pain feel inside. Some people overeat. It's what I do. Obviously. Just tell me what's bothering you. Because Brandon is saying I was scared ... and thought you'd do something to hurt them ... and he was only protecting himself. Eli, if it is, then I must send those kids home. There is no reason to keep them here. Then wait outside. His mother comes to get you. Eli They killed my brother. Who? All of them. Eli is a serious charge. Listen, if ... if not estivertomando His remedies ... I'm taking the drugs! Jess, are you okay? Sure? You do not believe me. Why did they kill his brother? Because he was handsome. He was perfect ... and they, ugly. Do you know anything police did not know? He was coming home. Look what I'm doing. - Take it easy, man. - He will walk. They ran as ... a dog and left him for the birds. Its prove it? What is going on here, chief? Vince. It seems that is examining the van of my children. You is very clever. Do not mock me, Addison, okay? I'm not in the mood. Now, I received call from my son ... and he told me that being held here indefinitely ... only to protect him an aberration. His son Brandon and his friends beat a defenseless boy who ... just bury her brother. He was killed by a guy who hit him and fled. He claims it was Brandon. And I see you ... made a recent repair here. trabalho Benny's workshop. My son hit a deer two weeks ago. And you can see how the work was done well before the boy's death. Let my son go. Now. You know what? I think I'll keep it ... here a little longer. And I think you ride with stranger the service order your child's ... two weeks ago. Came in handy today, do not you think?

He was made a recent repair in his van. Yeah, I think I ran over a deer or something. When was that? A, no. Two weeks ago? Nick! Someone you know has been killed by a driver who fled. That boy, no matter how you think you're crazy ... lost his brother. If you know something, your duty is ... his duty to say something. I do not know anything. Hi, honey, what's wrong? You know the kid who hit died and the guy ran? Devin Driggers? His brother, the youngest, he had a melee ... with some kids at school today. Brandon Marshall was one of them. He claims that Brandon killed his brother. I think I believe. Funny you call me right now. And why? Because I am on the pit Devin Driggers and ... it does not appear to be most into its hole. Whew. What ... bizarre. It is. And what should I do with the boys? Keep them there. All of them. What should I tell Eli? You is a psychiatrist. I dunno. It has living relatives? Only the mother. No. Alright. Guess I'll have to see if she's home. Right. I think I'll wait. Look, if you do not want to know my parents could have said. No need to spend around this problem. Well, I just wanted to ensure that all this is not my fault. Right. Goodbye. I brought some papers, so you can draw if you like. Listen, the sheriff is going in your home to talk to his mother. He will try to resolve it you go home soon. Then they found Devon's tomb? What? Look, if you say something, need to tell me. I said nothing. Lie. He said. What's going on, Brandon? Look, if I fuck ... all screwed up. Do not forget. We're in this together, partner. This has to do with Devon? Nick? Brandon, what did you do? I did nothing. Want to give it a rest? - This is not your account. - Nick. Seriously, shut up! That has nothing to do with Devon. He's dead. Right? He was hit when he went home. It is a dangerous road with drunks and addicts. That's it. End of story. This has to do with us, right? Nothing to do with you. Sheriff's Department! Hello? Delegate Blair. Mrs. Driggers? Hello? Mrs. Driggers? Sheriff's Department! Hello? God! He knew of the violation of the tomb, or whatever it is. And now it's quiet. It will not say anything. Look, I'm sorry for the boy, but he is sick. And I do not want to forget that. As much as we want to help you, and who thinks that Brandon has something ... to do with the death of his brother, we have to be vigilant here. You are right. We do not really know much about it. Except he lost his brother and probably took it from the pit. What makes drawings as well bizarre. Nothing good. Nothing good. Excuse me. Middleton High School. Director Addison talking. Yes, Mrs. Morris. Yes, Mrs. Morris, a controversy involving a student. No, ma'am. I do not think it will take. I keep informed. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, thank you. Goodbye.

It says to me they look? Alright. What is the situation? I have a corpse. Eli? Hello? Sheriff's Department. I just want to talk. Hello? Now listen. Why does not appear to we have a little chat? Wow, I'm crazy for the day to end. Why does not appear? Anybody been here? No. Who are you looking for? Okay, I will not take. After all, why is keeping us here? What makes you think you can use that tone of voice with me? We're here all day. We did nothing! Alright. Then tell the sheriff Blair when he gets here. What? For this? You seem a bit tense, Mr. Marshall. There's something I want to share with me? So okay. Hello? I just want to talk. Nobody will arrest anybody. Hello? Hello? Slowly, okay? I just want to talk. - Do not talk. - I do not want to arrest anyone. - I saw. I saw. - See what? - I saw. - See what? Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What is. You can only kidding with me. My God!

What did you say? He is coming and ... you is a good girl. - You better go. - Who is coming? He's coming pegartodos them. Eli needs to be clearer. Who is coming? Devon. How is? Devon. - Eli, his brother is dead. - He never died. His brother is dead. He hit died and was buried for nearly a week ago. He's coming, Mrs. Parker. We put something in it. I know this is hard to accept. You were very close. - But that does not mean that ... - He is not dead. Okay, he did not die. But if he is not dead, I then explain that. Help me understand. I was the one who found him. Someone help me. She did not apply to traditional medicine. The Mexicans go to her for help for things. Sometimes to deter evil spirits, or get them out of them. But we put one in Devon to prevent his death. To keep it alive. We take it where killed and call the police. He needed to be buried ... stay on the ground for six days. You do not believe me. The mind is a complicated and powerful. I know that if one believes something that is real ... very real ... then is true. There is fiction. But you do not believe there are things we can not see. Do you think there is an explanation to all problems. If you could see what I see. Yes i believe in things you can not see. There are spiritual laws ... principles such as honesty and compassion governing the spiritual foundation. But ... I do not believe that a spirit can live in someone else's body. I do not believe that one can back from the dead to seek revenge. You do not believe in God. AFE ... - A person is one thing ... - But you do not. You can not tell me what I believe it or not, Eli It's all over your face. You is very clever. We wrap and created God but he did not create you. Or maybe ... maybe you have prayed For someone who never got better. Is that what you're selling, Eli? Spells, demons and devils, because I do not buy that. I want you to consider. Just consider, even for a moment ... that is creating all this fantasy ... to feel like his brother was returning. - There is trouble, Eli - He was the one who loved me. I know how you feel. Also seek impossible things. - I know how is this type of pain. - You do not know pain. - You took him from the grave? - No. So who did? Eli I want to help you. I really want to. No matter anymore.
