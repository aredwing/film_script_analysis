That's as close to the wall as I can get. Alright, my friend. Listen. You are the editor now. That means you are the last line of defense. Okay. We can't have stuff like this making it to broadcast. I mean although Jimmy is terribly, terribly frightening. It's a... We can't have him in the shots. It sort of ruin the mystique. - So I'll cut it out. - Magic out the whole thing. Yeah, I understand. So, I'll cut it out. I don't know. Cut it. Zoom it. Paint it. Edit it. Edit. You edit it. That's why we hired you. - Okay. - See, that's why Pete left. - What? - That right there.

Do you ever see any real ghost and stuff. No, no, no. Not really. So, what does all this do then? Oh. Mostly it lights up, looks good on camera. I mean its... it's real stuff. Like this is a real motion sensor and this is really an EMF detector. I just. I modified them for the show. so we can trigger it remotely and stuff like that. Okay, so that it all would work if it had to. No. No. I modified them passed any practical usage. - Oh. - Except. This puppy. Built it myself. From scratch. - What's that? - I called it... The "Ghost burst." - Ha-ha. - No, shh. What does it do? It emits a small scale of EMP and a blast of full spectrum light. Wow. I have no idea what that means? Truth is, I've never really tested it. It would probably destroy anything electronic within 500 yards. If it worked. That's why, I also build a small scale version. What does that one do? Lights up, looks good on camera. - Right, yeah. - Yup. Last resort on this puppy in case things ever get, you know. Real scary. Okay. - Yeah. - Okay. - Cool. - Yeah. So as... soon as Emily has done with her personal business, - we can all get started. - Thank you so much. I'm... really looking forward to meeting you. Okay, great. Bye. I got a... I got a call back. That's great Em. When do you leave? Next week, but it's just a call back. So. Okay. Well, just to... You know, be clear. Do you still have time for this or there is somewhere else you need to be. I'm here Leon, okay. Let's just focus on what's next. Nobody knows what's going to happen anyway. So it's nice. Did I hear something about Michigan? Alright. Next up, we have. Saqwasibi Fine Arts Camp. A secluded artist school and retreat center in northern Michigan. A 5 mile, one lane dirt road that winds through the dense forest is in fact the only way in or out of Saqwasibi. Mid 1800s. Michigan's logging industry was booming. Making more people rich than any gold rush out west ever would. The George family fortune was made here. Ralph George. Owner and operator of Saqwasibi, which is band his family since it's original construction in 1852. Ralph George, Owner - This is a Saqwasibi hotel. It's no longer a logging camp but the houses, the structures, the grounds are pretty much the same. Except for some basic upgrades, a few modifications Well the camp is remained relatively unchanged, it certainly has seen it's share of disturbances. Our story really begins in 1859. When a lumberjack by the name of Pierre Boutierre killed a whole bunch of people. All of them right here in this hotel. A serious change in behavior for Mr Boutierre was first noted during an incident involving some of the children of the camp. The children used to like to play around Boutierre's cabin One day, one of them, accidentally I am sure, threw a rock and it went through his window. Pierre just lost it, he really lost it. Well... all of a sudden, Pierre tears out the of the cabin. And he's carrying a fire place log in his hand. And he begins to beat the kids up, and he be actually breaks a couple of their bones. He nearly killed one of them before he was stopped. The community brought Mr Boutierre before the foreman and the other heads of the camp. Well, it was right here in this very room that they had their gatherings and their meetings. So it's probably in this very room that they had their questioning or trial. They decided it was best to ask Mr Boutierre to leave on the next wagon out of town. Much of the logging was done in the winter months because it was easier to sled the lumber down to the river's bank and then wait for the foreman and rafted down the river But this year was a particularly tough winter. Bad patch and they were completely snowed in. Nothing went in or out of that camp. Boutierre was asked to stay in his quarters until the roads were passable. Guess they, they never thought they needed to lock him down. There've never been an incident like this before He was a man. A quiet man, very quiet man. They certainly never anticipated what was going to happen next. That night, Pierre left his quarters. Got an axe. He snapped. He just snapped. Pierre went from room to room. Terrifying, maiming and killing anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in his murderous path. When it was all set and done. Pierre Boutierre had murdered 13 men, women and children before being gunned down in front of the hotel. But it seems Pierre is not the only spirit in Saqwasibi. Kyle Rivera, Ghost Attack Victim - We don't even, you know, Kyle Rivera, Ghost Attack Victim - really come out here in the off season and uh. But to check on the place, you know. You know, but you know. Some people, you know. They've seen a big bearded man and then he wasn't there. You know, some people said they've seen uh. women, kids. Doors opened and shut. Sometime, you think there is someone in the room with you. It's just... no one there. Sometimes, you feel someone in the hallway brushing by you. Nobody. There's nobody there. However the spirits were never overtly hostile, until recently. Couple of months before we called you, I was out here doing my checks and uh. Felt like someone was in the room with me. It knocked me down. I got back up. It threw me down again, and then knocked me down the stairs. Malinda Sullivan, Clairvoyant - I hope people who experienced Malinda Sullivan, Clairvoyant - unexplained phenomena in their home or buildings. This camp is filled with spirits. I believe one of them is evil. So. This is the room where you claimed to have communicated with Pierre. Or mostly communicated about him. The other spirits seemed tormented by Mr Boutierre. Someone's not a people person. Heh-heh-heh. So, I asked them what I could do and. They pleaded with me to banish Pierre. But I have no experience dealing with such an evil presence. I believe he's wanting a a direct confrontation And I'm certainly not willing to do that. Well, you're smart. That's why we're here. You made the right call. So, Mr George. How can "America's Most Haunted" help you. Well, there is someone or something that is making my staff very uncomfortable. And it's very possible that it is now attacking them. So you want them gone? I want them something and I dont give a damn what. Do you want him gone? Yup, I do. Then let's get this ghost. And with that, we were left on our own. Short of walking 5 miles through dense forest, we were stranded at Saqwasibi for the night. With accommodations and the hotel for all of us. And who knows who, or what else. What? - Excuse me. - Did you say something? No. Ah, here they are. - You all shoot the intro yet. - It's finished. Oh, the squibs. I love the squibs. Yeah. Would have been nice having a couple of extra hands. Oh, I know. And I'm so sorry I couldn't been those hands for you. Why don't you come inside and I'll show you the rest of your job I've done. Michael, get off your ass and give them a hand. Alright. And you. You know a little exercise wouldn't hurt you. Look at all these hands. Lead on, it's a hand party. I almost had a bar. Jimmy and the new guy are here. I really hope nobody has to reach me. So when're you going out there? Tuesday. When's the audition? You know. The, the call back. When is it? Wednesday or Thursday. I just know I have to be there Tuesday. Hey, I'm, I... I'll go with you if you want. You would go to LA? I thought you hate LA? No, I don't. I don't hate LA. I mean. But I mean, I would go with you, if you want me. If you want someone to go with you, I mean I would. You know, it probably be even, you know for me to go out there You know, check out the city and stuff. That's really sweet. The thing is, I'm not sure I'll be coming back, you know. Mm-Hm. Yeah. We'll pick you up in the morning. Becareful. Thank you, Mr George. I'm sure we'll be fine. So. You really think you can get this ghost. Of course. That's what we do. Well. I can't wait to see it, Mr Falco. Okay. See you in the morning. Alright, nobody at home, set it there. Oh thanks. Looks cosy. Does anybody has cell service? Coming to get us in the morning, Emily. - I'm sure you'll be okay. - I'm fine. Okay, so we have the old original hotel over there. It looks really great. There's a lot of great location we can get most of the show in the can, in a couple of different spots. We can do some ghost lights. We can do uh some door gags, we can do some mist. There's some good opportunities for some obscure figures behind corners. Yeah, I'll look around. See what I can find. - I have a question. Sorry? - Go ahead. Guys, take a look at this place. Don't you guys think there's actually a chance that you might catch something real on camera. Real? Real ghost. I mean this place has to be haunted. You know, it may very well be. But ghost don't typically follow production schedule very well. We're only here for 1 night. And we can't expect ghosts just show up because we happen to be here in shooting. Not to say that they're not here. 'cos they maybe here. Mad respect. But, it's just highly unlikely that they'll pose for pictures, that's all. You seemed disappointed. You wanted them to be real? I kinda hoped but I figured that. Let's hope we packed ham and cheese for lunch. That's my hope. I mean. We've caught real stuff before, right? We were warned that the spirits in this house hate books. Then, there's the thing with the toy train moving. Of course we did have to shoot it for like 7 hours and speed the footage up like 500% so you can actually tell that it was moving. What we've learned over the years is that patiently and respectfully waiting for ghost to appear just makes for bad TV. Even worse, boring TV. If we're going to stand out among the millions of ghost huntings, spirit whispering paranormal shows With lots of ghosts. I mean I think we've a really great fake ghost show. Jimmy does a great job making fake ghost. Thank you, darling. It's nice to be appreciated. We're on the same page here, conceptually? Yes. Okay! Let's rig up this old crap shack. We hurry up, we can have this whole show in the can by midnight. Careful with her, boys. She's a lady of age and distinction. Why're you all still sitting here? While encounters had been reported from almost every location in and around the hotel There was definitely a consensus on locations where the evil presence seemed to be concentrated. With our cameras in place, ghost and EMF monitors, on and active and our dedicated crew ready. We were sure that this would be the last night Pierre Boutierre was going to spend in the Saqwasibi hotel. Incoming. Okay, everybody...whoa. - Something's down there. - Yeah. Yeah. I think we spit up and... I don't know, try to get the big stuff first and then just fill in what we need Yeah, let's split up. Me and Scotty will stay upstairs, and Rob and Emily downstairs. - Lock the doors up here - Door gag, got it. Basically, it's simple version. We'll find the ghost. Drive him downstairs into that room, And expel him. Okay, so just uh I send it downstairs. Oh yeah. Actually that's good. That mean that would be cool because that's where the trials are placed or whatever. You know. Maybe you're down there, you're rolling you hear something. Play it up. Do we have surveillance in that room? Yeah, I got a camera in there, 1 in the main hallway there. 1 in the stairway we just came up and 1 in the back stairs where the kid got pushed or whatever. - Great. - Uh, ghost light on the stairs? Yeah, that's good. Let's set... Heh-heh. See, that's what I'm talking about. Right. Ancient old building like this. It should make noises like this all night and do our job for us. You roll in on that, you hear something, you play it up, there's you segment. Done. - Cool. - Let's get to work. - Always rolling. Always rolling. - Right. So uh, I don't think Emily is coming back. Yeah. I think Rob's thinking about leaving too. Wait, what? What makes you think that? He's got it for her bad. He wants to go with her. Rob? What. I don't think the feeling is mutual. Emily is never uh. What about you? What about me? Come on. I think we all had it for it. One point or another over the years. And you do know she's the reason our audience watches the show, right? You don't really think that? Look at her. Look at her and then. Remember what it was like to be 16 years old and stone and horny. Sitting down on your parents' couch. watching stupid television shows all night. Yeah, she's why they watched. Scotty, that can't be the only reason. Wanna bet? She's going to LA. She's going to get that show. And then we'll find out, won't we. Alright, okay. Let's say you're right. What's the plan? Reinvent ourselves. Reinvent the show. Make the show we said we were gonna make when we started, right? And when that doesn't work. Find a new hobby. - Hey, you guys like this door? - Yeah it looks good from here. Yeah, I like this door. It's a good door. Better. Still scary, but better. Okay. This should be in frame don't you think? Oh yeah, yeah totally. Those things are so wide this whole room is probably in frame. So. I was probably. Let's do something in fable. We'll sit. You sit on the couch. I'll sit in the chair. Yeah, maybe gen a little scene first. Yeah, yeah. Like brain in the middle is good. Okay. Cool. - Okay, Jimmy? - Yeah. Can you hear me like this or do we need a signal? Yeah. Yes, you can hear me or yes, you need a signal? Yeah, I can hear you. What if we talk a little quieter like this? Barely. Okay. We're gonna do an it's getting cold talk. And then you slam the door. - Slam it? - That's right. - You got it? - Cold talk, slam it, copy. Okay. - You ready? - Yeah. - Good to go. - I'm gonna walk in the frame. Okay. Alright. And... action. This hallway is one of the main concentrations of the haunting. We've been hearing things up here all night. Cut, Jimmy! - What? - You're early, buddy. Yeah, I can't hear you at all in there. That's why I asked, Jimmy. - Can you hear me right now? - Yes. Go in the room. - Can you still hear me? - Yes. Okay, remember. Cold talk. - You said "Cold talk". - You're hilarious. I like the ghost Bette 'cause you're dead on the inside. Okay. Take 2. Action. This hallway is one of the main concentrations of the haunting. We've been hearing things up here all night. It's. It's almost like something feel It feels like something is up here, you know? Yeah, I know what you mean. I've like sometime in my stomach. Like a, I feel, I feel sick, dude. You know just when you said that, I started feeling really nauseous. Whoa. Whoa. Are you kidding. Are you kidding. Are you cold. Freezing. It's like the temperature just dropped like 10 degrees. What was that? Did. Did you get all that? - Nice door gag. - Yeah. Okay. So. Alright, I'll start with the intro of the room. You know. This is where the trial was held and blah blah blah. And uh. Then take our seats. And go ahead and lead in with "Did you feel that." - And then we'll go from there. - Yeah sure. You just start talking. I'll do a little pan around the room and... - Ready? - Yup, how's my hair? It's... It's good. So, alright. Night vision. OH! Uh. What? I, I don't know. I thought, I thought I saw someone. - Was it me? - No! No, no. It was other, other than you. Like, right behind you. Like... - Shut up. - real, when I turned the night vision on it. Just, real quick. - Nobody's there. - I mean. Yeah, I know. I wouldn't. Not now! Nobody's there. But I mean it. Just real quick, there were... - Well, who was it? - I don't, I don't know? Be... Crazy ghost or just. Never mind, maybe it's... Well, rewind it. Let me see. I... I wasn't recording. Dude! - Press "Record". - Okay, alright. There's definitely something up here. Every door in this hallway just slammed shut. That was crazy. What was that? I don't know. There's... There's something in that room. Shh, shh, shh. Hello. Is someone up here with us? - Hey, you guys hear that? - Jimmy, what the hell. - Did you guys hear that? - Yeah. - What was it? - There's something in the room with me, man. - How did you get there? - Oh yeah. Check this out. See, there's a door between this 2 rooms. These lumberjacks were swingers - Serious, there was something in the room. - Yeah, what? I don't know. I didn't stick around to find out. You do it. Get that ghost. - Okay, Scotty? - Yup, almost. Let me know. Alright. - Jimmy. - Yeah, chief. - Get off camera. - Oh, that's right. Okay. We found the door in this room that leads to the room where we heard all the noise. We're going to check it out. It's quiet now. Look at the bed. Yeah, the dresser too. Someone was in here and it wasn't any of us. - Rob and Emily aren't up here right? - Nope, they are downstairs. We just went though this place an hour ago, it didn't look like this. Hello. Is there anybody here? Is there anyone here that wants to talk to us? We really want to talk to you. We saw what you did with this room. Just give us a sign that you're here. Can you move the bed again? Come on, give us a sign that you're here. Anything. How about the dresser? Can you move the dresser again? Just move the dresser. - Do you want me to move the dresser. - Cut. - Dude, what are you doing? - 'Cause I can crawl over there and move the. So, James. You didn't do any of this. - That's what you're telling me? - That's what I'm saying. Someone else left the furniture like this. Alright, if that's true, I don't know what's going on but I like it. You got all the doors stuff and the noise coming from this room. Yeah, I got it, and the surveillance camera at the end of the hall got it. We should probably set a camera up in here. Yeah, there is an extra we can set up. So is that a break for lunch. - You tired? Jesus. - I'm hungry - Okay, let's take a break. - Alright. Guys, come here. Look. What was that? What. What was what? It's been happening a couple of minutes now. There he is again. - I'm not seeing anything. - What? Yeah, I'm not seeing anything. Did you see it, that type. - Rob. You are recording, right? - Yes. Yes. I'm not seeing him in my camera. Oh my gosh. What is he doing? He's looking at us. Oh shit, Leon. Talk to him, try talk to him. - Okay, yeah. - Yeah. Go talk to him. Hello. - My name is Leon. - Shit! - Oh. - What? What, he's not there anymore? - He's gone - No. - You scared it away. Damn it. What now? - I'm still hungry. - Yeah. And if this kind of stuff is going to be happening we should get the other camera set up. And we better be well fed for it. Let's get sandwiches. Kidding. It's your call. Okay, go, go. Yeah. - Yes, sandwiches. - I'm down with that. - What was that? - I don't know. It's got to be something with the night vision. - One of the infrared, maybe. - Hey, let's lunch. Okay. Okay. Okay, there's something really going on here. - Yeah, no kidding. - Uh. What're you guys talking about? Just all the ghost, all over the place. Like, real ghost? That one you guys saw wasn't the only one. I mean, before you came down, I swear - I saw something right behind Emily. - Right behind me. I mean it was really quick though. You look in the view finder and it was gone. - Did you see that one? - Uh-uh. I... I wasn't rolling. Okay, so it's an artist camp. Right? While these, pictures of Pierre and portraits around. A portrait is a profound interaction between the artist and subject. Often capturing a piece of the subject's soul in the process. All these pictures and paintings around it All these souls trapped here. They must be channeling all this activity. Really? Hey Leon. How much of that did you just make up? All of it. All of it. I'm just trying to find the angle here. Did you guys remembered the mustard? Okay, just wait a second. So I mean. I don't know if you guys are messing with me or. If you're seeing any actual real ghost then maybe that lady was right. Wait, what lady? I don't know. The clairvoyant lady or whatever you called her. Maybe, yeah why? Well, I don't know I mean. She said that she talked to it. And if things get real out of hand. - Got this baby. - "Ghost burst". Right. Alright, okay so, first things first. We need to get more of this stuff on camera. That means rolling. Always, always rolling. Want me to take the camera up to room 9. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You want help? - No, I got it. Um. I think I left my bag of mustard up there anyway. I don't want to get all the ghost before Leon scares them away. - Jimmy, becareful. - Hey, careful is my middle name. - No, it isn't. - No, it isn't. Shh, shh. You guys hear that. Hear what? No, no. Never mind. Listen. We, okay. So we all get cameras. We all split up. Make sure you're set to night vision. Because for some reason they showed up on night vision. We'll just have to. Leon. Yes. Right, split up. I'll take the back hallway. - Do I get a camera? - No, no. You stay here. This is headquarters. You just sit tight. You'll be fine. Yeah, sure. I'll be fine. Hello ghosts. Where're you gonna be. Whoa. Whoa! Shit. Shit. Shit. - You got your night vision on? - Yeah. Creepy ghost vision on. - Raah. - God. Oh my god. You should have seen your face. Scotty! Aw. So, uh. Are you seeing anything? Just know I'll let you know. Maybe we should just go back to the main room. Oh. That door just open while we were standing here. Yes, it did. You think something wants us to go in there? I think you're right. Okay. Okay. Oh my god. Now they're out there. It's like. It's like they're messing with us. - Emily? - Oh my god. - Emily? - Rob. Emily. The door is locked or something. I don't. I don't see a lock, Rob. There isn't a lock. Somehow it locked. Just relax. I mean, I'll get something to open the door. I can't open it. Just, just hang tight. I'll be right back with something. Come right back. Okay. Just. Okay. Oh god. What's going on? What do you want? Of course you want me to go down there. (Thou... shall...) (get... out...) Heh-heh-heh. Heh-heh-heh. Oh, come on! What are you doing? Oh. I just. Did you hear something? What did you hear? Voices, you know. Typical haunted house stuff. Yeah, I heard... stuff. - So, this is kind of unusual huh. - What? Like. You don't experienced as much activity on a normal shoot Honestly. No. Never seen anything like this before. Okay. Okay. You still think we're, you know. Safe, right? I think, I think so. Isn't this what you were hoping for. Uh, yes. Yes, this is cool. Don't get me wrong. It's just that, you know. I'm a little creep out in here, that's all. - Well, it's creepier out there. - Okay. I'll come with you. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Rather not, sit in here alone anymore. Okay. - Stay off camera. - Okay. No, no, no. No, no, no... - Leon? - God! Scotty. - What're you doing up here? - Is he gone? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you okay? Oh man, look at this, dude. Look what he did. - Wow. - Did you get it. Here. I thought I was going to die, dude. Can you get up? Oh yeah, I can get up. Look, we have to find Rob and Emily. Are you sure he's gone? Yeah, I mean, I think so. I mean I haven't seen him at all since you, you know, since he... Hey, to be fair. He had an axe. I didn't have anything. - Oh yeah. He's kind of going for you. - Like this. Yeah. (Hide...) Emily. Go, go, go. I'll be right behind you. - Leon! This way. - Hi. Emily. - Emily? - Where is she? - She was in here. - Where were you? She got locked in here. I went to go get something - to open the door. - Hey. Keep it down. What happen? - Why did you scream? - It wasn't me. I was in here under the bed and there was a girl. She told me to hide and - some guy came in. - Pierre. And he saw me. Then she screamed and she ran out of the room - and he chased her. - Are you okay? I'm fine. It's Pierre. Pierre? You mean like, Pierre Boutierre? What're you doing here? Me? What are real ghost doing here? - Look. I was told when I first started. - Wait Where's Scotty? Hey guys. Okay. Um. Where's Jimmy? No, seriously. Has anyone seen Jimmy? He went up to that room. Jimmy? I'll check the other room. - What happened in here? - Ghost. Yeah, he's probably just messing with us. He's not over there and he's not anywhere in the hallway. It's not like Jimmy to leave gear laying around like that. Well, there is his backup mustard. He wouldn't leave the building without that. - Are you sure this isn't in the show? - No - No, it isn't or no, you're not sure? - No, it isn't. - Did you find him? - No, nothing. We walked further than Jimmy would have walked. - He's not here. - Well, if he's here. he's set us up for a good scare. Because we didn't see him anywhere. Well, maybe we should just stay here. No. No, no. We've to go back over there. I mean. I think we have to, don't we? Well, what about Jimmy? He's got to be in the hotel still somewhere. No. We should go back over. We should wait for him and we should finish the show! Might as well. They're not coming back till the morning anyway. Those ghost ain't gonna shoot themselves. See! That's the attitude I'm looking for. And Scotty took an axe to the chest. - What! - What! - Well, a ghost axe. Yeah, still hurts. Look, you guys. Pierre did that? - Yeah, yeah, upstairs. - But I thought he was a ghost. Yeah, he's a ghost exactly but he did that. I think we need to think about leaving, you guys. On the contrary. What! Leon, look! They can physically hurt us. Yeah, I have to admit that sort of changes the game a little bit. You guys. - Scotty's okay. Alright. - That's not funny. Besides. I don't think they can kill us. Oh, you don't think they can kill us. Right. Because they, you know. They're... cause of different... You know, I can't even make anything up right now. I mean. Maybe they can kill us. I don't know. Alright, well. Jimmy's missing, presume dead. - Whoa! We're presuming he's dead. - Yeah. Isn't this something we should decide as a group. Just because we didn't find him, doesn't mean he's dead. Em. Give us this last one. Then you can leave without feeling bad. Who says I feel bad. Look. We cannot run from this. I mean, how pathetic is it that we have a ghost hunting show. and when we actually encounter a real ghost we want to run away. - Why would I feel bad, Leon? - Fine, you don't. Just finish this show with us. This is why we all started doing this in the first place. Isn't it? You think I feel guilty for taking the other show. Wait. You mean going to the call back. She's already got it. What? Emily. Look. You're beautiful. You're talented. You're strong. You got a great personality. You're going to be very very famous. And I love you very much. We all do. And for a second, I need every one of you guys to try to remember why we started doing this in the first place. Because we actually believe in this stuff. And now, here it is. You guys aren't mad at me, are you? I couldn't take it if you guys hated me. Nobody hates you Em. How could we. Yeah. Yeah, you. You got to do what you got to do. Well. Would be kind of a cool way to go out. Good! Alright. I got a plan. Well, I hope so. Now, first I. I can't explain everything. I just need you guys to trust me. And I need you to grab the "Ghost burst". Wait. That's your plan? Leon. None of this stuff actually works. Trial by fire. Let's burst this ghost. Okay, it's a real ghost. And that's a fake solution to a real problem. Look, I need you to trust me. I think I actually know what I'm talking about this time. Here. Look at this. The journal of Pierre Boutierre. - Where did you find that? - Some place you don't want to go? Look. If you're ready for another big shock. The journal of a lumberjack is pretty damn boring. There's a lot of stupid things in here like. Blade sharpening techniques. - The biggest tree ever cut down. - What was it? - What was what? - The biggest tree. How big was it? That's so not important right now. What is important is the last 2 journal entries. Here. I'll read it to you. I'm going to quandary over a recollection of a dream. In that dream, I spoke with a spirit. A spirit who called himself Bumshara. He made me a most peculiar yet tempting offer. To my surprise. When I became aware of my surroundings I was standing over nearly a pack of wood that I had split with my very own hands. It was as if I had not been dreaming at all. And this is the final entry here. I've accepted the offer of Bumshara This would be my last entry as I am leaving for more rewarding life endeavors. Well. What do you think that all means? I believe Bumshara is a demon. Well, that's nice. So you want to take on what you believe is a demon. Yes. And I can't explain why right now but you just have to trust me. I knew it. See, I knew. That's why it hurts. It was a demon and he had an axe. I didn't have anything, you guys. Okay, so. Heh heh. Let's say we trust you. We take the "Ghost burst". Then what? Then I. I try to lure Pierre into the common room downstairs. And. You know. Then I. I kick him out of there. You know. Just be ready with that burst. Big Finish! How exactly are you going to kick him out of there. Trust me. Please. Okay. I think I'm staying here. - Heh-heh. I wouldn't. - Come on. Come on boys and girls. Grab your cameras. Let's. Let's get this ghost. Are you kidding me? We're actually going to put our fate in something called a "Ghost burst". Jimmy. Jimmy said it would work. Oh. Did Jimmy said that? Yeah. He had a lot of technical terms for it. It's got like uh. ADD or something. - Yeah. I'll buy that. - Listen. Leon is obviously crazy. but he can't be crazy enough to think that, that is all of a sudden going to work Okay. I'll bring him down through here. Okay. Where do you want this thing? Over there. You need to keep it in frame but you also need to be able to get to it. Okay. Kevin. If you're gonna stay up here, you have to stay off camera. So, maybe back in that corner over there. Yeah, no problem. Rob and I are going to go upstairs, and I will attempt to lure him down here. How are you going to do that? I have an idea. Are you up for this? You'll be fine. It's just a ghost axe, right? But if you do see Pierre coming at you, I suggest you run. That's actually my idea, so. Okay. Let's do it. Okay, stop. This is good. Right here. Okay, rolling. Okay. Just a second. Okay, I'm ready. - What're we doing? - I'm gonna try and call his name. - Pierre? - No. Bumshara. - Where was it? - Over there. It came at me in there. And knocked me down the steps over there. Something. Something is here. - It isn't good. - Is it ever? Sometimes they're nice. Bumshara. Bumshara, I want to talk to you. - Leon. - What? There's something. What? You see something? Yeah. Yeah. Right by your head. What, what. You see her? - Her? - Yes, her. Do you see her? I'm, I'm see. I see something. She's been talking to me the whole time. What do you mean, the whole time? Ever since we got here. - What's she saying to you? - She. Welcomed me to the camp when we first got here. She lead me to the back hall. She helped me find the book. Honestly, I didn't say anything because I thought I was insane. No one else was hearing it but me. Well, who... who is she? Bumshara? No. No. Mary. Her name is Mary. She's telling me what to say. How to get rid of him. She says we have the tools. The "Ghost burst"? I think so. Keep rolling. Rob, is he back there? Do you see him? Him or her? You were saying her earlier. Him, Bumshara. Pierre. No. But I hear something. Yeah. Yeah. I think he's back there. Bumshara. Are you there? Come on. Don't you want to talk to me? Come on, man! - What're you doing? - What? Are... Are you taunting him? A little. Let's... Let's get this ghost. Come on, camera. Pierre is not your problem. Bumshara is your evil spirit. He's trapped here, in Pierre. - There's a journal. - Journal? Pierre's journal. - I don't know. - Some old books in the basement. There's a journal. Bumshara. Show yourself! - Did you hear that? - Oh yeah, I did. I actually mean did you really hear that. I'm not doing a gag. Yeah, Leon, Leon. I heard it. He's here. - Leon. - What? He's right there. - Is it Pierre? - Well , he's got an axe. Wait. - What, what did she tell you? - Just keep rolling. Bumshara. Come on, I wan to talk to you. - I'm right here. - Leon. - I'm right here, man. - Leon, Leon. - What? - I don't think you want to do that. - Where is he? - Well. He's walking at us Okay. He's. He's by the stairs. (Run...) I heard that. Did she say run? - She said run. - Can we run? - Yeah, let's run. - Okay. Go, go, go...! He's coming! He's coming this way! - You said he was coming that way! - Never mind what I said. - He's right behind us! - Oh shit! Leon. - We're all set up this way. - I didn't send him this way. Hey guys! He's right there. And he looks pissed. Bumshara is your evil spirit. A demon. But there is a way to make him leave. First. Someone must confront him. You need to confront the thing that knocked me down the stairs? Yes. But that's not all. Are you talking to someone? Mary. Mary was a residence here. Pierre killed her. She wants to tell us what to do. Look. Oh my god. - (Bumshara.) - Bumshara. - (Bumshara.) - Bumshara. - (Bumshara.) - Bumshara. - (Bumshara.) - Bumshara. - (Bumshara.) - Bumshara. - (Bumshara.) - Bumshara. The "Ghost burst". - (Bumshara.) - Bumshara. Someone needs to hit the "Ghost burst". Go. Leon. - (Bumshara.) - Bumshara. Leon, stop. Bumshara. Bumshara. Emily. I hope the shit works. Bumshara. Bumshara. Bumshara. - (Take me.) - Take me. Wait. What? - Mary! - Leon. Hit it. Hit IT! Oh. - Jimmy. - I knew it. Someone must invite him in. And whoever does so will take Bumshara with him. - Away from here. - And then what? I mean like. Where do they take him. I don't know. Wherever he or she goes I suppose. Who the hell would do that? Certainly not me. We all know what this demon did to Pierre. Or at least made him do. We just got to get him out of here. The liability insurance is killing me. Well then you going to have to find someone who will take him. - Just who the hell would do that? - Hold on. What about those ghost hunting shows on TV. - They're fake, you know that. - Yeah, probably. But have you seen that America's Most Haunted one. - Get this ghost. - Right. So, you have seen it. Yeah. They go in and they. And. They don't just go in and try to contact the ghost. They kick the ghost out. They are idiots. They sound perfect to me. Oh oh. - Was that the ghost burst? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. My camera won't turn on. That son of a bitch. Nice going, Jimmy. What? You said ADD. Did you mean EMP? Is that what he said? Oh yeah, right. That's it, EMP. That's what I meant. The EMP. Jimmy actually did it. - That means everything is dead. - Except us. I can't believe Jimmy actually created an ElectroMagnetic Pulse generator. Uh. I'm still be able to have kids, right? It means. That's a break. That's a break. Your's a break. Everything electronic in this room is gone. Leon. Are you okay? Whoa, who. Hey buddy, hey buddy. Hey, you're good. Come on. - Oh. - Whoa, whoa. Leon. Oh. Hey Emily. Are you okay? Fine. Great. He's gone. Jimmy's ghost burst actually worked. That's nice. But I.. I think it fried all the. I think it fried all the equipment, Leon. All the cameras. I think the cards too and we lost all the footage. That's good too. That's great. Leon. No, no. It's. Show gone. Footage gone. Everything gone. I've said it before but I mean it this time, guys. He needs help. - Let's get you out of here. - I'm a hero. Yeah. That'll be a real good work today. - I think I fell down. - I think we all did. So, I pooped in my pants a little. Haven't seen Jimmy in town. Have you seen him around here? We haven't seen him since last night. What do you want to do? I guess we'll just go back to town and talk to the police I think we should. I'm a little worried. Let's just get out of here. Well, whatever you say. Mike and Kyle will take you back to town and I'll be back shortly. Leon. I'm okay. So, what do you think? He's gone. He's definitely gone.
