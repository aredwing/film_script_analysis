Come on, we're making ice cream. No! I still have to pack my stuff. - Well? - Hello. - Everything alright? - Yes. Good. - What is it? - Looks quite good on you. Hello... Maybe you should visit your uncle more often. - Did you have fun? - Yes. What is it about me you dislike so much? When you don't like someone, me for example, then that's not a problem. But it is not good when you don't tell me because I absolutely don't know if it is something I could change. Can you give me an answer? Why do you think I'm so bad? Ok. - You know what? - What? Keep it simple and say: I hate you! I hate you! Louder. That can be much louder. I hate you! - I hate you! - And now... - I loathe you! - I loathe you! And now quietly but very angry: Don't talk to me again! - Don't talk to me again! - Exactly. And now you can shoot me... Bang! Bang! I forgot to strip the beds. That's ours. Leave it for now. I'll bring the sheets next time. Who knows when we'll meet again? Rebecca is freaking out. Excuse me. - See ya. - Bye. I want to talk to you about our sex life. I can't manage anymore. And that's why I brought myself some backup. Hello, do I know you? Good day. You're a small one, huh? Gitti is too. You didn't promise a lot, Chris. Stop annoying me! What? You... You just make up stuff. You hear that too, or is it just me? Schnappi would like to know what a penis actually is. He would like one of his own, but he needs more information. But I told him, I consider him to be far too small and that he better not be spoiled too much. Did you hear that too, or was it just me? I hear him too. He told me something else. What did he say to you? That you have to shut your mouth when I'm reading. - No, that's not what he said. - He did. Stay like this. Hello! Hello hello! Hello! What are you doing? - Who was that? - Hans, our neighbour. Damn, for a second I thought Hans had found us and I look like a tranvestite. - Ciao. - Ciao. It's really not a holiday when Hans is around. We don't have to associate with anyone. Nobody knows where we are. This is so typical. Hans is the kind of person who always comes by coincidentally, from one thing comes another and then he accidentally makes some contact. At the Documenta fair, nobody liked him. Did you see what he made there? Yes, it's really nice what he does. It's quite something, without being stupid. Rebellious architecture. What a shame. Yes, that's how I please you. As a girl. Yes. I think it suits you. Tell me, do you actually think I'm masculin? - Yes. - Sure? No, I just have to laugh because of the question. I thought it's something that will come. With age. But somehow it doesn't happen. - When my hair is falling out. - Are you becoming bald? No, I really think you're pretty. And sexy. By the way, you don't have to be manly. What do you mean by that? Do something manly. I'll tell you if I notice it. God... That reminds me of something. - I need to win the competition. - For sure. You're just feeling a bit unsuccesful. I actually don't want to be unsuccesful. No. Besides, you're absolutely not. Did I tell you that I called them? No. The guy on the phone knew about the design. I promise you, it's the truth. I know it. - Why are you laughing? - Because you fiddle so badly. What do you mean? With your arm. - You haven't done that before. - What? I do it all the time. And the references are on their way? Ok... Yes, we know that. It wasn't too complicated. Philip, that's not true. It really wasn't that complicated. Sure. Ok. Don't be sad. Yes. Ok. Yes, see you later. Bye. And? Nothing finished yet. They need more time. Too bad... - Maybe that's a good sign. - That's no sign at all. - How is Philip? - He's fine. Is my TV watching time over? You don't understand a thing. You're just wasting time. You got to be kidding me? You ban me from watching TV? Are you upset? Are you? No. I'm just tired. You look so sad. - Can I ask you something? - No. - Do you hate me sometimes? - Why would you ask me something like that? Just now in the lounge for example. There was this strange look in your eyes. That was hate, no? - I hate you when... - I didn't ask you that. - But I... - That's not what I asked! Come on, lie on top of me please. Make yourself very heavy. Hey, shall we go out? - Yes? - No. Please. Today is Friday. Please, please, please. Let's go and dance. Lets go to a club. - Please! - There's nothing to do now. But there's a lot to do in town! - Come on, please. Let's dance. - No. - Please, please, please... - No, I don't feel like it. - Please, please, please! - Are you stupid? What? What does that mean? I said you look fantastic. You don't feel like it. Can you speak German please? Your mother had an obsession. Look at this. Party! - It's really something here. - It used to be fuller here. Maybe we're too early. And what kind of music do they play here? Oh, this is amazing. Let's go and have some fun on the dancefloor. Come on, let's go. Show me what you got. Come on, show me some moves. - This is shit. - Go for it. You're so stupid. Can't we do it without? It's much nicer. It's nicer this way. I love you. I love you. No, don't always answer me like this. You make me so happy. I'm so happy I've found you. You were the most beautiful woman in the club that day. I love you. What are you going to rebuild here? It's perfect as it is. I'm not planning on rebuilding anything. It's just a renovation. I would do it. It will be fun. Something different. You're not serious. So... Here, he would like some kind of lounge area with some kind of curved bar. And the style would be a bit Japanese. So, you want to get rid of the country-style? I will borrow a Jeep, to drive to the building site so I can shout at the Italians. If we would have that much money, I would come and help you. Come on, be serious for a second. I can't really be picky about this place. No, but I think you can really make something cool out of this place. Why can't we make time for this. - Because it has nothing to do with me. - I would do it. Come on, let's have an afternoon nap. I won't be able to get an erection. My dad thinks I can get some contacts. Anyway, you have to wait and see how the competition will turn out. Or you can do both? We should go for a walk. Soon it will be too late. We have to demolish that thing. It will only get worse. Oh my god. - Oh, shit. - Damn, you're bleeding. Oh my god. Everything is covered in blood. Get something to clean. Who the fuck closed the door? - We're driving to the hospital. - I want to go for a walk. You're crazy! We're driving to the hospital now. Exactly. Have a nice flight then. Yes. Have fun. See ya. - Does it still hurt? - Yes, a little. - Who was that on the phone? - The guitar player from The Shames. The Shames? Why are they relying on you that much? Everybody can book flights. Yeah, but it's my job. What a Schnappisaster. A Schnappilemma. What a... Schnapparody. A Schnappuccino, please. Schnappi-dick. Did you get that one? You're a Schnappi-dick yourself. Hello. You're still lying there. What took you so long? We're invited on a boat trip. Who invited you? Two Germans. I met them in the caf. Oh, ok. - And why? - Well... They have a boat and I told them we'd like to go on a boat trip. What do they do? Who are they? No idea. They're ok. They are really nice. Nice? It seems they're these kind of authentic people... like Ingrid and Rainer from the ferry, who we ask questions about their mobile home. Don't be so arrogant! But being down-to-earth is arrogant too. Look, I got you a tartlet. And afterwards... I bought something. Actually, I'm not so fond of it. Just stand up straight. I don't like it. I think it's too suburban. It looks fine to me. It's not ugly to wear something like this. What happened with Schnappi? We banged our heads. What did you do when I was gone? Just lying there? In this tragic position. I thought about something. About what? Oh, about everything. About me. About you? What did you think about then? For once, can we please talk in a normal way? Sure. I'm sorry. What did you think about? I don't know what to do. I think everything is so absurd. - Us, or what? - No. It's not about us. Just listen. - Yes. - You really don't listen. What is so absurd to you? Just... What I do. How I live. My work. You thought about the house, or...? I think you have to risk something in life. You're so scared. You have this fear to settle down. That's probably uncompromising, and also... not really brave. It's not only the work, that's the same for everyone. You don't see that. You can't think about a decision for 14 days, or how to invite two people for a dinner. Then you're not getting ahead. You're so anal about everything and nothing can change your way of thinking. In theory you're free and you can do what you want, but then you have to do something. But it's always "Shall I do this or that? No, that." Then you actually don't do anything at all. That's why you spend so much time in your office or biking, just like others spend time with their children. And with Philip you demonstrate your independence, that he must tell you how much he misses his freedom and family. What you don't realize and he likely doesn't admit is how nice it is to come home. In his house, where his children sleep. He can get out of the house anytime he wants but maybe he choses to be with his girlfriend. I think you can risk a lot more. But if it doesn't work out, then leave it. I want to live together with you. We can try. You can have your own room with hay and a light bulb, so you feel comfortable. I'm sorry, I probably have thought too much about everything and I wanted to tell you this already for a long time. Why do you believe you know me that well? I wanted to talk about something completely different. Why don't you set the table? But I really don't get what you wanted to tell me. I would like to be different for you. What do you mean? How do you want to be then? Sometimes I see a woman, walking past us, who could be perfect for you. Then I see you two as a couple, and everything looks so much better. Most of the time, these women are completely different than me. Then I can't help but think, that I should be different for you and I wish that, because I think that... I can make you much happier when I would be different. Sometimes I also have the feeling I have to tell you a lot more that I admire you. How much I love you. Actually, I love everything about you. - You don't have to. - I do it anyway. If I were different, I could get to know you in another way. That thought makes me very sad. I'm afraid I'm probably not able to get to know you like I really wish. I really would like to be different sometimes. Are these childish thoughts? No, I have these thoughts too. I think I'm too boring for you. In the beginning, when I met you, I imagined myself, entering a room and you speak to me for one last time and I simply jump out of the window, to surprise you. But that's quite sad. I wouldn't die, I just fly out of the window. Like Batman. But that doesn't make any sense. If that's the case, then you would have already died for me. - What's that? We don't need this. - Schnappi needs this. Schnappi eats whatever is put on the table! Excuse me. Can I pass? Here's another light beer. Ouch! Come on, are you crazy? - What's going on? - That's Hans. What are we going to do? Oh my God, Hans! What are we going to do? What are we going to do? Look. Ciao. Be quiet, quiet. Boo! Did I give you a fright? - Well? - It doesn't matter. Hans. - That's just a coincidence. - Man, man, man. Gitti, I just bumped into Hans. - No. What a coincidence. - Hello. Hello. Gitti. What did you do? - Your holiday is going the wrong way, no? - Yeah, sure. Sana, come here! - Look who I just bumped into. - What a coincidence. - Good to see you. - My wife. You're kidding! - What did you do? - It's not that bad. - Something hit my head. - The glass door told me another story. Finally we get the chance to meet you. I get bored by Hans so quickly. We... announced we would be here. I'm not so sure you reported that. For sure. We didn't know you were here. Oh! I don't believe you. You can't hide from me. That's my instinct. - We haven't met before, no? - No. I'm sorry. I meet so many people. It's a good thing you know it better than me. - Excuse me. - Grazie. What do you think? We just bought some really nice lamb and you come with us to our place for a barbeque. - Oh yeah. - We are already invited to go on a boat trip. But that's not really important. If you want to, we can take them with us. - But we don't know them at all. - Come and join us. It's not very nice not to go. - Are you still able to talk? - Yes. I didn't know you knew them that well. The way they greeted you... He's always like that. I imagined him to be a lot worse. Why are you doing that? It hasn't completely healed yet. Is it because of them you're taking off the bandage? Let's turn around and go on the boat trip instead. Come on, be reasonable. No, no, no. - Here. - Do you want me to become a fat pig maybe? Yes. I have to say this... Sana is pregnant. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - You can't tell yet. - Oh, I think so. I hope I won't become a fat bitch. We also played parents on the weekend. But we rather failed. - Really? - Yes. This belongs to a friend of ours who is a painter. Ulrich Wolf. - The one with the nose. - I don't know him. Please, have a seat. Oh, man. And that's where he got her pregnant. Chris! - Can you open this? - Yes. Your parents have chosen a very special island. - Just give us some advice and tips. - Of course, will do. No problem. - Tell me, does Hans read that? - No, he doesn't. I read that. That's from the farmers over there. Very good. - Delicious. - Come on! - Have you been here before, on Sardinia? - No, it's the first time. It's a cool island. I always say cool. "A cool island, full of cool Sardinians..." Oh, you opened the bottle of champagne already. Yes. I thought it was a good idea to start. - You're the first ones who we have told. - How nice! - You see? - Here's to you guys. My friend has a dress you designed. She guards it like a treasure. - You make nice things. - Thanks. - But I can't really afford them. - Yeah... Me neither. She's so succesful, I have to get her pregnant to make sure she stays with me. Now the truth comes out. You think it would suit me? - Me as a father? - Yes, of course. It's something that suits everybody, no? Well, yeah. - But we don't know each other that well. - What do you mean, we don't know each other that well? I think we know each other quite well. Of course we know eachother well, but we're not very close... When it comes to things like this, friends can judge it in a better way. - Gitti, did he actually tell you about me? - Yes. Nights and nights he has been talking about you. - That's how I imagined it. - I thought so. I don't have any friends besides you. Well, yeah. Later on, you probably can still become friends. Exactly. Is it the pregnancy or do you often have strange dreams as well? I rarely dream. I dreamt something very funny. I dreamt I adopted a giraffe together with Larissa, you know her, the art teacher. We drank coffee on a hill and waited for it. When the giraffe came to us, it was so obvious that the hill was about the same height as the giraffe. We were so overwhelmed and I was so scared. Yeah, and then Hans came and in a professional way he handled the giraffe very carefully like he had never done anything else in his life. It was so calming. Hans said hello to the giraffe. He was the only one who could handle the giraffe in a proper way. What whould that mean? It's not very deep, no? That's the embarassing thing. It's not that embarassing when you dream something without any meaning. That's right. Chris, what do you do? Don't be so secretive. Oh, I do a lot of different things. Perhaps something here on the island. I'm planning on renovating a villa. Oh yeah? And? Is it going well? Yes, it can turn out quite well. But that's something for in the future. And what do you do? I have worked very hard lately. I have to recharge my batteries first. We have worked for the Documenta fair for about one and a half years. We have built a new orangery. I'm just a bit lost for the moment. I want to lose weight, so I'll look a bit better by the time the baby is born. - But was it fun? - Sure. It was great. That's what the dude should do too. - Which dude? - Your friend. He's alright, but unfortunately he's a romantic. What do you mean he's a romantic? He believes in a world that doesn't exist. That's a bit too mystical for me. What do you mean by that? He wins a competition but doesn't pull through with it, because his design is being mixed with another. That's just stupid. That's exactly what I do now. I invite you for some cheese and wine, I pretend your ideas are mine, and in the end I have my way. Why do you say that to me? He's sitting there. Because I'm talking to you for the moment. Chris knows I would help him at all times. We don't need these old-fashioned phrases and teachings. - He didn't mean it that way. - But you're annoyed by it too. - Come on. - Come on! I think you're a bit patronizing. - Well, that's how I am. - I don't care what you're like. - Stop it. - Enough is enough. Hey, hello! It's kind of silly. Everyone of us, Hans at least, I know that, thinks Chris does nice things. I'll go get some brandy to calm things down. Chris is a genius. I don't know a single person who can make such complex things, designed in such a simple but intelligent way. - You're doing it again. - What? The way you talk about things. I'm not so keen to share this with you. Very nice Brunhilde, hm? One who always defends her man. I don't want to listen to this right now. It's not easy for us, isn't it? You are so embarassing. Here you are. - You're not angry, are you? - Of course not. I'm waiting until something becomes of you. What do you do? You working together with Philip? Yeah, it's really good. We complement each other perfectly. Philip was slowly starting to get nervous. He thinks our designs are too expensive and too complicated for him. He just had two children. I have recently seen your superb design at the terraces. Unfortunately, it didn't get built. Do you know the people of this Lowa competition? Yes, all of them have worked for Haussmann. But they are conservative assholes. We submitted something one day, in between bigger projects. It didn't work out. Yes, that's the problem. We also took part, but it didn't work out either. Our design was actually quite good. They don't even care. You never told me that. No. I really don't want to know who will renovate the museum. Loser. - What's that? - What? That's my new backpack. - You can't take that one with you. - Yes, I can. - What's in it? - I can't tell you. - I'm not going with that. - You don't have to. - I'm not going to carry it. - Yeah. Come on Chris... It's a surprise. - Just tell me what's in it. - No. Ok... Well, it's a paraglider. You don't know everything about me. I've done this back in the days and I wanted to fly into the valley with you. No, really! It's something I have always wanted to do. Really. Sorry. Sorry. And you really believed me... I didn't believe you. Yes you did! Sorry. I'm sorry, man. Stay on the track. - Why? - At the top, it will join together again. Ok. Is it much further? - What? - Well, the place you are looking for. Are we at the right mountain yet? Yes, I think so. Well then... Don't look. Champagne? After this, it's still a bit further. Are you serious? Have a look again if you're not sure? I'm sure, but let's stay here for a while. Man, what you have put together here. I really don't want to get drunk here. I'll prepare you a plate. Why didn't you tell me about the competition. I didn't get the chance. One week? I'm sorry it didn't work out. But I understand why you didn't want to tell me. I just want to say that... you make everything right. I think it's amazing, how you think about these things. It doesn't matter to me whether you are successful or not. - You know that, don't you? - Yes. Come on. It's funny how people can get lost nowadays. We didn't get lost. - Why don't you trust me? - Because we're wrong. I really can't walk for another five hours. Do you really have to run like this? You're such an asshole. Don't you see I don't have the energy anymore? Is this really necessary? Why do you walk so fast, huh? Oh, there you are. Thanks. I'm going to drive to the city again to have a drink with Hans. I really can't be alone here. - Why can't you be alone? - I'm scared. Sure... Why don't you take me with you? I want to come with you. - I don't want you to come with me. - Why? You can't behave yourself in a proper way. What do you mean by that? I don't want to experience the same thing again like the time we had that barbeque. Tell me how you would like me to be, what you want and how I should be. - Look around and see how other people behave. - But I don't want to be like other people. You want one like this Sana? "A giraffe that trusts only Hans." You always have to exaggerate. Chris! I'm normal. - Let's go. - I'm really normal! Oh, I'm so normal! As normal as I am. Yes, I'm so normal! Are you alright in the head? You were scared I was going to strangle you? - Why are you awake so early? - I just got up. What's up? I didn't sleep that well. Why are you so wet? Hans was drunk and he threw me in the pool. Which pool was that? I showed Hans the house. Thanks. What did Hans think about the house? He thought it was interesting. Under certain conditions. - So, are you going to do it? - Yeah, let's see. First of all, I met the client. I've made it clear to him I won't compromise. That's fine by me. I'm going to bed. I'm so tired. Do you still like me? But sweetheart... You know, I want to get up early tomorrow. - I would like to measure something in the house. - You do? I can do something else. Gitti. Kitti? Katharina? No, no. - Brigitte, Brigitta. - Brigitta. - Happy? - Sure. - Hello. - Hello. What a coincidence. Let me think... Do I know you from somewhere? Hello. What are you doing here? I wanted to make alterations to the dress and then... Well, I figured it was actually quite ok. I just went for a walk. Have a seat. Thanks. - You're meeting them in town? - No, I was just hungry. - Did you buy something? - I did. I bought something for your mum. What's the reason for that? As a thank-you for the house. I think it's ugly anyway. Show me. I think it's nice. It's really cool. - It's good seeing you again. - Really? I could be very rich soon. He was totally thrilled when I showed him my stuff. He is interested in architecture, or at least pretends to be. - I think he'll decide to build something new soon. - Really? I'm happy for you. No, thanks. Are you ok? I want to meet Hans and Sana again. I can go by myself or we could invite them. We could invite them, no? You think so? Yes. I think it's a good idea to invite them. Ok. I told them Saturday would be ok. I can cook something for us then. - Hello? Gitti? - Hello! I wasn't sure if it was you. - Hello. - Hello. Chris! That's my boyfriend. - Hello. Sandra. - Hello. Hey! Hello. Petersen. I'm really sorry we didn't make it. Yeah, we noticed that. I'm sorry. I forgot an appointment. - Oh, you're the ones with the boat. - Exactly. We're really sorry, but I met a former university colleague. That was such a coincidence. We couldn't deny his offer. The offer is still there. I'd love to, but I don't have that much time. I work on the island here. I'm looking after the renovation of a building. - Chris is an architect. - Interesting. I didn't even recognize you. Nice dress. Thanks. - I'm wearing different make-up. - No, everything. I wasn't really sure for a moment. - The offer is still there. - That's really nice of you. I would love to go on a boat trip. Yeah, sure. See ya. Bye. - See ya. - Bye. What kind of ideas do you have for the house? I have thousands of ideas. I tear that thing down and ask him how he wants it. I'll be finished soon. I'm afraid I will lose you. Don't answer me like this. How should I answer then? I love you? I would do anything for you... I don't want to leave you... Well? Fine. What's going on here? They should be afraid of what we have planned. What's that? That's quite weird, isn't it? They won't understand it. But we get it. Somehow, it's not funny. Come on, please. I don't think it's funny. If it's a girl, Hans would like it to be Basmati. - Brunhilde. Hello. - We would like to invite the neighbours. We had trouble finding it. You're looking good. - Here, something small. - Oh, thanks. It looks the same as in the other bunker. Rubbish. It's a slope. I should be worried. - It's nice to see eachother again. - Yes. - Looks good on you. - Thanks. Man, I was drunk... I thought we had been here before. - Have you responded yet? - I'm negotiating with him. Hopefully I have advised you properly. I'm not interfering with the professionals now, no? - This could be interesting. - You think so? The bloke isn't really that bad. It's very nice here. They gave you a lot of trouble. It's looking good. Thanks. It's good like that! That's such a delicious sauce. You're a good cook. Enter my wigwam have a rest with me Rainbow-Johnny Rainbow-Johnny Come on and let's be happy Rainbow-Johnny Rainbow-Johnny Don't leave me by myself again! That's why I love him. That will do! - Hans? - A small piece, yes. So everything is alright again. - It's really good. - Where did you learn how to cook? Maybe I can send Sana over. Gitti, what's your profession actually? - We have tried to figure out... - I work at Universal, the label. In the PR-department. I negotiate between bands and journalists. - Do you know "The Shames". - Who? - It's one of those young bands. - The Shames. You told me about them! Sana guessed you were a photographer. And I thought you were a kindergarten teacher. Gitti is rather unconventional. - Yes? - What? You want to tell them? Rebecca. Why should I tell it? Gitti has taught my sister's child how to shoot. Well, Rebecca did not want to have a lot to do with us when we were looking after her and that suited Gitti. She told her it was ok to tell other people when she hates them. First, she taught her how to say "I hate you" and then Rebecca was allowed to shoot Gitti. She pulled a gun and fell in the pool, dying. My sister was pretty horrified. - Nice. - It's quite unconventional, yeah. Now I would like to see what has been taken away from me. Wow! It's pretty wild here. - Hans? - I want a guided tour. Hey, Hans... What are you doing there? Is this your "fun cave"? The bedroom of your parents? - And this is where you sleep? - Yes. I have always wanted to have one of these too. Yeah, Gitti gets changed behind that. Well... My therapist says I shouldn't take on anything. He advised me this kind of sheet. Psssst... What the hell is this? My mother collects this kind of shit. - Don't be so nasty. - What's nasty about that? - Come on, don't. - Be respectful to my mum. My mother's paradise. Wow. Wow! That is glamorous. Crazy. - They are made from glass, huh? - Perverse, right? Hans, just have a go with your axe. Oh, that's cute. - No! Don't touch. - Oh my god. No, just have a look. There is something in each and everyone of them. Read it out loud... "To live is not enough, said the butterfly. Freedom, sunshine and a flower. That's what we need." - Hans Christian Andersen. - I have to puke. That's good. I'm touched, I almost have to cry. Everything is so adorable here. - And what do you do here? - Dream. Nice hi-fi system. Wait a second. That's Grnemeyer! I was a big fan back in the days. Oh my god. I tenderly have Thought about you As you gently and very carefully Made me totally crazy You came when you wanted You left at eight in the morning Thousand and one One night I love you, so much More than you think I love you, so much Even if you're not with me You don't want to be with me Am I such an old tree? A family with you, that is my dream But it was to early It will definitely be better Another like me You want to wait and see But you don't know yet I love you so much More than ever I love you so much I'll take it as it comes Call again That is torture for me. - Can I help you? - No. Are you crazy? You will end up in the pool today. - I don't think so. - You'll see. You weren't even swimming. You clearly fit quite well there. I didn't know you had rich parents. No, they only miscalculated the price of the pool. I'm jealous you're allowed to work here. Yeah, that's exactly how it is. Pregnant women are so boring. - If you dare. - Your dessert. Now it's your turn, my little one. Let's go, it's time for dessert. Stop, that's not really appropriate now. - No, I can't. - You can swim quite well here. I'm pregnant. No! - No, Chris. - Stop it! No! You guys are assholes. Such bastards. Do you have a towel for me? You wanna know something? Go out and tell them it's bad for your pregnancy and that you want to go home. Ok? Thanks again for the delicious roast. You really have to give Sana some cooking lessons. - Ciao. See you later. - See ya. Take care, huh? Well... Thank you very much for the invitation. - Yeah, it was fun to have you here. - Bye. I'm sorry. I'm going inside. Gitti? Ow, there you are. - You're not cold? - No. Wait a second. I love you so much... I don't want to go to the beach. I'm tired. You can sleep at the beach. Just go, I'll be there soon. Please come with me, it's really nice there. No, I'm going back. Yeah, that's what he said to me too. Yes, exactly. Just call back later. No, my number. Tell her that I need her next week. Sure. Yes, I'll tell you everything. Ok. Yes, you have to tell me everything. Alright. If you know something in the morning, just let me know. Yes. See ya. - Who was that? - Daphne. They are stressing out and they need me. But they're not sure yet and they will let me know tomorrow. That's not what you just said. I don't love you anymore. I'm flying home. Can we talk? Who was that on the phone? Why don't you love me anymore? Because. I don't believe you. You're such a loser. Oh! That doesn't hurt me. Then why do you sleep with me without using a condom? Relax, I'm not pregnant. You want me to make something up. A guy who rebuilds houses and invites you to dinner, that's really gutsy. That's how your life is supposed be. Comfortable and fun. You want to tell me what being risky is? Look at you, sitting there in your shitty tracksuit giving me clever suggestions. What is it that you want? Look at yourself. It's like you're trying out a new fashion style... There's something desperate about it when you're around Sana. - I wanted to see if you liked it. - No. I know you love me. I'm sorry you think that. You have tears in your eyes. Out of compassion with you. - Do you really find me that ridiculous? - I do. Ok, if you really think I'm such a loser, then you have to get out of here. So, what's it going to be? Gitti? Gitti, is everything alright? Gitti? Gitti, what's wrong? Hey! Hello? Stop ridiculing me like that. I really don't get you. Yes? Hello, Daphne. It's Chris. No, she's not here. She's at the beach. Oh yeah. Yes, I'll let her know. Yeah, do that. Ok, bye. That was Daphne. You should call her back. But you know that. Can you please stop this? Gitti, can you please stop with this show? What the fuck is wrong with you? Look at me.
