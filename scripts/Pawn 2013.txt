These winter colds are just the worst. You know, if my shift moves any slower, I think I will be going backwards. - Time to play, you ready? - Ah, I'm kinda busy right now. You want some pie? - Oh, pie. - Pie. No, I just want some coffee. Coffee. You got it. How long that pot been sitting out there? I just made it-- fresh pot-- right before it got busy, Will. - Hey, Will. - Aaron. Want some more coffee? You haven't even put any coffee in my cup yet, Charlie. Damn. God damn it, Aaron. Um, how are you progressing with that coffee? Sorry, I'm-- I'm not real with it today, you know what I mean? You want cream and sugar? Cream. - Cream. - Do you want cream and sugar with the coffee? I'll take it as it is. Whose move is it? Hmm, Charlie? Charlie? Charlie? Charlie? Whose move is it? Your move. It's your move, Will. That's right. Next Tuesday evening. Mm-hmm. How you doing? I've been down to the diner, it's a mess. Look, is this necessary? - I already gave a statement. - I understand you've been having a tough time lately. You could say that. I've been working for extra jobs just to try to keep my head above water. Man Everybody likes Charlie. Anything you don't like about him? Anything unusual? - Like what? - I don't know. Kind of thing maybe you wouldn't expect at an all-night diner. You know who owns the place. Yeah, I do. Tell me who was there that night. Just take your time. Think a minute. I-- I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? You spent enough time there. Who was there that night? Just customers. I'm gonna need you to tell me how it all went down. I need $2. That's it. I don't need an extra day off or anything. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. - What the hell is this? - I would've thought that was fucking obvious, mate. Okay, everybody in the corner. Move. Move! On your feet! I'm not gonna say it again. Get in the corner! Move! Come on, love. Now! Let's go, on your feet. Let's go! On your way. Right, if you're smart, you're scared. If you're not, you should be. I don't want any heroes and I don't want any grief. You do what I say, when I say it, and everybody will be able to walk out of here. - You got that, geezer? - Yeah. Exactly as I say or I blow you against that fucking wall. Right? Now if you'd be so kind just to step out from behind there. Let's go. Eh... hey. - My hip. - 911 emergency. What's the nature of your call? All right, son, on your feet. Let's go, move! Hey, cheeky. - No. - Let's go. Come on. There's a good girl. Crawling under there isn't gonna help you. Doing what you're told might. There, it's all right. You'll be fine. Right, mobiles, watches, and wallets into the bag provided by my associate here. Now, I know you're all scared and that's a good thing. If you're scared, you're a lot less likely to do something stupid. Because if you're thinking of doing something stupid, I guarantee you will regret it, but only for about the half second it'll take me to turn, aim in your general direction, and pull the trigger. I have no more desire to be here than you do. So if everybody does what I say, when I say it, things will go a lot smoother. - I didn't think you'd come. - Me, either. I promise everything's gonna be different now. We're gonna pick up Bonnie, is that okay? Yeah. - It's just-- - I know what you're thinking. I couldn't get it done before and how am I gonna be able to get it done now, is that right? Are you gonna take responsibility, you know? Are you gonna be there when we need you? I made mistakes and I paid for them. But I know what's important now. You don't have to worry. I promise I won't ever break into another car again. I have an ultrasound appointment today if you wanna come. You kidding me? Try and stop me. Oh, shit. I'm supposed to meet Patrick's friend for this job interview. That's all right. If you can't make it, you can't make it. - It's not a big deal. - No, screw it. I can reschedule. I'm coming with you. Are you fucking blind? Watch where you're going, you stupid cow. Not you, Bill, another cow. Wait, what are you doing? You just got out five minutes ago, please. It's not worth it. I'm sorry. Hello! Jesus, Bonnie, what are you trying to do to me? I'm sorry! I'm just so excited! How does it feel to be out in the big, wide world? - It almost feels safer on the inside. - Yeah, right. I hear those communal showers are really tough - on the good-looking boys. - Okay. - Really? - Come on. What's the deal here? You living in a hotel? What are you, big time now? My apartment is flooded, so I'm staying here till they fix it. - So what's next? - Dropping you off at the next corner. Oi, what'd I tell ya? Nigel, keep a lookout for us. Now, who's in charge here? Eh? Who runs this place? I do, I do. Oh, you are a proper geezer. There's a safe in the back. Take me to it. Register's open, a lot of cash. Why don't you just take it, get the hell outta here, huh? I'm not gonna tell you again. Either you can walk me to that safe or I can blow your legs off at the knees and you can crawl there. The safe is back in the office. After you. - Go on! - Yup. It's all yours, Bill. - There it is. - Open it. Today, you mug- Back away. That, you cheeky bastard, is not the safe I'm looking for. Where's the cash safe? I don't know what you're talking about. if at some point I've given you the impression that I don't know exactly what's going on around here, or that I'm some thick cunt you mess about, I apologize. Now, where's the safe? The real one. The one that says you get to keep your good fucking leg. Open it. - Can't do it. - Excuse me? I can't open it. It's on a time lock. I can't open it until midnight. That's God's truth. Fuck.Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Keep an eye on 'em. What's going on? It was meant to be a quick in and out. Safe's on a time lock. Fuck off. Are you sure? Well, it says time lock on the door, so, yeah. I'm pretty fucking sure. - What time's it set for? - Midnight. Midnight. I suppose that's why he told you to pull this at two minutes before fucking midnight. It's 30 minutes away. What do you want to do? - We're gonna sit tight. Wait it out. - You're joking. I'm not leaving without emptying that safe. And what happens if someone comes in? - Like who? - Like customers. We keep the doors locked, put the closed sign up. It's not exactly brain surgery, is it? This is not what we planned. If you've got a problem, Bill, trot on. I'll have your share. Okay. And then we're out. It's okay. - We've got trouble. - What now? - Cops. - How many? Who gives a fuck? A fucking cop, we gotta go. - There's only one. - What's he doing? Singing fucking show tunes. he's a cop. We gotta get outta here now. He's standing outside his cruiser smoking a fag. Cops come in here all the time. It's a diner. Right. Then let's give him the warm and friendly fucking "Be Brite" experience then, shall we? It's business as usual. You and you back behind the counter. - What? - Chef and your mates, back in the kitchen. Let's go. And to all you nice people, back to your dinner. Back to chitchat, back to coffee, whatever it is that you'd normally be doing if I wasn't here fucking up your day. On your feet, back to your tables. I can't do this. Hey, look at me. Yes, you can. Let's go! Come on! Come on! Bill, I'm gonna need you in the kitchen in case the chef decides to get knife-happy. - Where are you gonna be? - Behind the counter - in case the old boy gets lively. - Okay. Oh, Christ. Eh, Bonnie, is it? Darling, if you're crying when someone comes in here, they're gonna think something's wrong. Now, you wouldn't want someone to get hurt, would you? - No. - Big smiles all around, then, eh? - Yeah? - Okay. Yeah. I want him out of here as soon as possible, understood? Yea-- yeah. Where you want me, boss? - Take one of the back tables. - Right. No fuckin' about. Here, here. It's all right. - Hello. - Hey, Yuri. Good to see you, Will. What do you say, Will? Slow night, huh? Got kinda busy about 10 minutes ago. It's time to play, you ready? I'm kinda busy right now. You want piece of pie? - Oh, pie. - Pie. No, I just want some coffee. You got it. How long that pot been sitting out there? I just made it-- fresh pot-- right before it got busy, Will. More coffee? You haven't even put any coffee in my cup yet, Charlie. - Damn. - Shit. God damn it, Aaron. I'm not real with it today, you know what I mean? You want cream and sugar? Cream. I'll take it as it is. So whose move is it? Hmm, Charlie? Charlie? Charlie? Whose move is it? Your move. It's your move, Will. You know what, I gotta take a leak. Why don't you top this off again and I'll be right back and we'll get into the game. Sure. Take your time. - Yeah. - I came in like we planned, but something's not right out here. I think this-- this Brit, he showed up early. What are you talking about? You told me there was gonna be one guy. Now, Charlie is giving me signals out here like there's a whole crew out here. Fuck, I told him to go in alone. What do you mean they're giving signals? Are they in there or aren't they? They're hiding from me. They're acting like this is business as usual. This is not what we discussed. They were supposed to come in, sit tight until this played out so Yuri wouldn't suspect that we were involved. Now I got fuck knows how many guys out here with guns and they're thinking that I'm the bad guy. Did you even tell the Brit that I was gonna be in here? Step out, step out of the stall. Step out of the stall with your hands up. What's going on? Will? Step out. Get the fuck out! Don't shoot, don't shoot. Somebody's robbing this place. No, shit. Step forward. Up against the wall. - Who the fuck are you? - I'm just a customer, man. I was in here when it started. You call 9-1-1? Yeah, of course. Did you hear that? No, there's a customer that was in the stall hiding. He called 9-1-1. His name is Nick. - Davenport. - Nick Davenport. Did he hear everything you just said? Yeah. I'll get back to you. Attention, all units. - Shit. - at the Be Brite Diner. All units report to location immediately. Code three. Repeat, attention, all units. at the Be Brite Diner. Turn around. So what are you really doing here? What the fuck are you really doing here? I told you, man. I just came in to take a piss. Don't lie to me. All hell broke loose. I called the cops, for Christ's sake. Till I figure out what the fuck's going on, this is going with me. I want you to stay right here. All right, kid? Friend of yours? What happened after the cop got killed? That's when things really started to get bad. - What the fuck's going on? - Cop was onto us. Found him in the toilet with this one. - So you just shot him? - Yes, Billy. That's where all the blood came from. - Mate-- - What do you care? I don't give a fuck, but I've got a funny feeling that every other cop in a 10-mile radius might. Look, I've told you once already, you want out, there's the fucking door. Maybe, if we're lucky, he didn't make the call before you got into him. That's the spirit. Now give our new friend here the once-over. I don't want any more surprises. No, no. No, no. - Cell phone. - I don't have one. That's nice. Almost time. On your feet. I said on your feet! Bollocks. You, help him up. Help him up. Charlie, come on. Come on. Off you go, then. Give me the bag. Keep an eye on 'em. Come on. For your face. You, that's far enough. Let's go. It's 12:00. Open it. Back up! Get the fuck back! Back in the fucking corner! What the fuck's going on back there?! Looks like a fucking road accident. Cloud... silver lining. - Glad you came? - Ask me that if we get out of here in one piece. Off you go, then. How we hold it down  - Say... - We be all around  - Say aluminum. - I don't want to. Come on, but it sounds so sexy. Aluminum. Now say herb. Herb. I love the way you talk. Really? What about the way I-- Don't move! Drop it! Don't try it, asshole. Sit down. Get outta here. Sorry, love. You don't pay your girlfriend to clean up here? What do you want? - I need one more favor. - We had a deal. You said the last time we were done. You're gonna be interested in this one. Don't look so fucking upset, it's easy. I just need you to get me a hard drive with some names on it. Names? - What names? - Yours amongst others. Mine? Yours, too, I wager. It's the big box of secrets to keep everyone in line and it belongs to an associate of ours. Yuri Mikhalev. He may look like a sweet old man, but he runs organized crime in Connecticut. Behind all the rackets, all the big jobs, Mikhalev moving chess pieces. That drive's his get-out-of-jail-free card. I wouldn't want it falling into the wrong hands, and that's exactly what's gonna happen in the next 48 hours if the FBI raids his safe. We've got a police informant inside of Yuri's organization. The FBI are gonna hit us. It's on for the 12th, you got that? I don't understand why he's not moving the drive and I can't ask him about the message because I'm not supposed to know about it. I think Yuri's selling us out to the Feds. - Is there any money in it? - You're gonna be robbing a joint. You get me what I need and everything else you find is yours. - I'm gonna need my crew. - No, no crew. Is that understood? You go in alone two minutes before midnight. Not a moment sooner. Billy, it's me. I need you to give Nigel a bell. Tell him we've got a job for tonight. Don't trouble your little mind with questions, Bill. Just call Nigel and tell him to be ready. Oi, are you fucking blind? Watch where you're going, you stupid cow! Not you, Bill, another cow. I'll explain everything later. Why aren't we wearing masks? How many more times do I have to fucking tell you? It's a quick in and out. This time tomorrow night we'll be sipping cocktails in Costa Rica. Why are we sitting out here at 11 :30 if we're not going in till midnight? Well, you'll be thrilled by a change of plans then, won't you? - What? - We're going in early. - Why? - Because our generous employer has told me, as so long as he gets what he needs, we can help ourselves to all the afters. And seeing as though I'm not doing this out of the kindness of me fucking heart, we're going in early and we're doing watches and wallets. Watches and wallets. You have seen the shithole we are gonna rob, right? - Yeah, what's your point? - My point, Derrick, is it's highly unlikely to be filled with Rolexes and fucking Louis Vuittons. Who's Louis Vuitton? A footballer? Nigel, do us all a favor and shut up. Right. Hey, what's going on? I'm tired of being in his pocket. We get what he wants outta that safe, I say there's a deal to be made. You wanna screw the boss over? Don't fuck the plan in the 11th hour, mate. Don't worry about it, Billy. He doesn't even know you're here. Nothing personal, mate. The whole fucking force just showed up. It's on. You, Bonnie! - Come over here. - No. Answer it. Hello? It's the police. Talk to them. Bonnie Potroski. I'm a waitress here. He wants to know if everyone's okay. Yes, everything is fine. Yeah, everyone's okay. He wants to know how many people are here. That's enough for now. Back to where you were. Go on! I want the public at least three blocks back from here. Nobody gets in unless I clear it. Looks like more rain's on the way, sir. Oh, perfect. Good of you to join us. - What's the situation? - Perimeter's secure. Snipers in position front and rear. They got nowhere to go. - Any visibility? - No, sir. Blinds are down on all the windows. So we have no idea what's going on in there. - Numbers? - Well, we're a little light on details, but it's a late-night diner, so at the very least we got the staff in there. I spoke to Bonnie Potroski, a waitress. She was very scared. Someone was telling her what to say. - Which was? - She said everything was fine, but we had reports of gunfire. It could be really fucking messy in there. - How many gunmen? - We think at least two. On top of that, we got one of our own in there. This squad car was issued to Will Tompkins. And I know him. - You made any contact? - No, but we got a suspect. A Nicolas Davenport. We ran his name. He just spent three months in County. You think he's involved? Maybe even running the show. - Who's your informant? - Stay on the phone. One second, I gotta take this. Anything else I should know? We ran the plates on the Cutlass. It's stolen. All right, I make every call from here on. - That clear? - What's your plan? Get them talking. The negotiator's about to start in. Uh-huh. Any idea on the suspect? There's a Nick Davenport. Just got out of county. Registered address two blocks from the diner. - 2240 Lincoln. - He got any family there? Yeah, his wife. Amanda Davenport. All right, well, keep me appraised. I want this shit cleaned up. It's okay, baby. Here you go. Direct line's right here, sir. Just like last time. Find out what he wants. - Hello? - With whom am I speaking? - This is Bonnie. - Bonnie, this is Jeff Porter. I work with the police department. This phone is a direct line to me now whenever you pick it up. I need to talk to whoever's in charge in there. He wants to talk to whoever's in charge. He says he doesn't wanna talk. Tell him I can't give him what he wants unless he gets on the phone. He can't get you what you want unless you talk to him. - I'm listening. - My name is Jeff Porter. - What's your name? - Look, the only thing you need to understand is that unless I get your full cooperation, I'm going to redecorate the insides of the Be Brite Diner with pints of blood. You have my full cooperation. I wanna give you what you want so nobody gets hurt, okay? I wanna make that really clear. I'm gonna try and help you out. That's very fucking kind of you, mate. I'm overwhelmed by your compassion for my situation. We have reports of gunfire. Is there anybody in there that's injured? Look, if somebody's hurt, let them come out, then we can do business. There are a lot of cops out here who like to do this a different way, so let's help each other out. I'll tell you what, as a sign of how reasonable I'm prepared to be, we'll let one out. Thank you, appreciate that. I'll send in two paramedics with a stretcher. Is that okay? Uh-uh, scratch that. We'll take her out to you. They're sending out an injured party. I want a wide area around that door. Back an ambulance up about 20 feet away. Not too close. I don't wanna make them nervous. Getting somebody out alive will give us a better idea of what we're dealing with. Let's get you geared up. Why you tell them we're gonna send one out? 'Cause we are. - Which one? - Her. She'll do nicely. I'm not walking her out. I will. I'll do it. Oh, yeah. You missed my announcement. I don't want any heroes, but volunteers are welcome. You take her out, you don't say shit, and if you're not back in 30 seconds, it's bye-bye, Bonnie. - Are we crystal? - Clear. Pick her up. I'll be back. All personnel, stand down. Civilians exiting the building. Stand down. Maintain 20-foot radius. It's over there. Are you okay? Talk to me. You need to tell me what's going on in there. Is she all right? Is anybody else in there hurt? Is that your blood? Talk to me, I'm right here. I can give you what you need. I can't talk to you. She was going into cardiac shock. That was Nick Davenport and he's covered in blood. - We gotta go in there. - No, no. They sent someone out. That's a start. We need to keep talking. I gotta remind you there's a cop in there? Do I have to remind you who's in charge? - Tompkins is my main priority. - This is my operation, Barnes. Trust me, we're a long way from moving in. Now tell me more about Davenport. - I think he's one of them. - Based on what? What makes you think he didn't volunteer to bring her out? If you think that he was such a hero, why did he go back in? As far as I'm concerned, he's a major fucking suspect. There are an unknown number of hostages being held, but it is believed that there is at least one police officer among them. - Sources inform us... - Oh, my God. ...negotiators are on the scene and are attempting... Nick was just there to talk to Patrick. ...again, very sketchy information... Hi. Mrs. Davenport? Is this about Nick? Yeah, I'm afraid it is. I'm gonna have to ask you to come with me, please. You might wanna get a jacket. You, come over here. Answer it. Tell them you've got demands and if they don't cooperate, the cop will be the first to die. - No. - Come again? I won't do it. Really? - Hello? - Yeah, who is this? I've got demands. Specific demands. What now? Hello, hello? Now we wait. - What is this place? - Just come on. Come on. This is Jeff Porter. We wanna help you with those demands, - but we need some way to communicate. - Well, that didn't take long. You go out there and you tell them we need a SUV to take us to the airport. Once we get the SUV, he gets four hostages. Tell him we need a jet and a crew waiting on the runway fueled up and ready to go. And once we get on board, he gets three more hostages. - Got that? - Yeah. Good. On your way, then. Oi, same rules as before. Got it. - I'm unarmed. - So am I. SUV and a fucking plane? - Are you out of your mind? - It'll buy us time. For what? - Plan B. - Which is? Soon to be revealed, mate. Let's just let him keep them preoccupied, shall we? - What's your name? - Nick. So how'd you get involved in this, Nick? I'm not involved. I just met my brother here for coffee. You can ask him. Is everyone in there okay? No, they're not okay. Do I look like I'm okay? They want a SUV to take them to the airport. When they get the SUV, you get four hostages. And they want a jet waiting for them on the runway. When they get on the jet, you get three more. - The rest go with them. - I'll see what I can do. Make sure that SUV gets here quick. Hey. So we can talk. What did you say to him? Exactly what you told me to. You wouldn't be fucking me about, would you, boy? - No. - Good. Oi, Bill. I'm having a piss. We got plainclothes going to Davenport's house. Pick up his wife. And this is interesting, the guy's brother is Patrick Davenport. - Who is Patrick Davenport? - Internal Affairs. You're kidding. Get him down here now. He's already on his way. - Yes? - Sorry to bother you, I'm Detective O'Reilly. This is Detective Creedy. - How can I help you? - We need to talk - to Mrs. Amanda Davenport. - She's not here. - Your guy already came and got her. - What? - Porter. - O'Reilly here. We're at Davenport's house. Her mother says some cops picked her up about 15 minutes ago. - They identify themselves? - We checked with dispatch. Whoever did this, they weren't cops. What's going on? A couple of guys pretending to be cops picked up Davenport's wife. I gotta take this. Hey, you got an update for me? A couple of detectives went to Davenport's house to bring in his wife, but she was picked up already. - I don't know by who. - I've got her. You just worry about wrapping things up on your end. Am I clear? Why aren't we at a police station? How long you've been married? HOW long? Almost two years. Why don't you tell me about the men that your husband's working with? What men? He's not working with anybody. Thanks. Want some water? I get dehydrated, so I like a lot of water. Copy that. - Lieutenant Davenport. - What's the situation? Well, your brother's up to his balls - in an armed robbery. - At his usual haunt that just happens to be owned by Yuri Mikhalev? Come on, Barnes. He'd never do that. I was just here with him Whatever's going down here, he's got nothing to do with it. What are you doing still coming to this place? You know you can't hang out in a diner owned by someone like Yuri Mikhalev. I like it. I know everybody. - You lost weight. - No club sandwiches on the inside. Yeah, it's not supposed to be easy. Look, Nick, you made me look bad today. I know. I'm sorry. How do you just not show up for a job interview? Amanda agreed to meet me. What, so you just blow it off? She's my wife, Patrick. I'm doing everything I can to make it all work out. I get that, but you don't let him know, you don't call me, that's not the way to start. - I've got myself a gig lined up. - With who? - Some people that I met. - Some people you met. Some people you met in prison, Nick. I told you. It's a legit gig, Pat. - Jesus, Pat. - Take it. Thanks. I gotta go. - Everything's gonna work out, okay? - Yeah. Well, all I know is there's a diner being robbed and your brother's in the thick of it. Of course you wouldn't understand, because there's real police work. As opposed to what I do? You've ruined the livelihood of good cops-- - men with wives, their families. - If they're good cops, they got nothing to worry about. And you should stay focused for half a minute on getting my brother and the rest of the hostages outta there. The negotiator Jeff Porter, he wants to speak with you. Thank you so much for coming back. I wasn't gonna leave you here alone. Yeah, but you could've surrendered out there and you would've been safe. I figured that if Amanda was in this situation... that I'd hope somebody would come back and look after her. It's gonna be okay. Excuse me, I really have to use the restroom. It's a bit messy in there, love. You don't let people use the restroom, it's gonna get a bit messy in here. Nigel, take her. Not without me. I beg your pardon? I don't want her going anywhere alone with him. Who, Nigel? That's a bit fucking offensive, isn't it? He's a nice bloke. - Aren't you, Nigel? - Yeah. Now sit down and shut up. That's a good boy. You all right? What is it? What happened? There's a dead body in there. You know, Nick was just there meeting up with his brother. You wanna call him? Yeah. Whose phone is that? It's Charlie's private line in his office. On your feet now! Come on! - Oh, my God. - Come on. Answer the phone. Answer it! Oh, my God. - Come on. - Hello? Bonnie, it's Amanda. You okay? No, they're right here in front of me. - Will they let me talk to him? - It's for Nick, it's his wife. Now why would the kid's wife have the private line? The cops put her up to it, didn't they? - Because? - Because they think he's the mastermind behind this whole fucking thing. Now get him in here. - Go on. - That's not true. - Nick would never-- - Shh. Hmm, Bonnie, Bonnie. You are a proper sort, aren't you? You've been very helpful. Perhaps another time. - It's your wife. - Amanda. - Are you okay? - I don't know, are you? Yeah, I'm fine, baby. - Jesus, Nick, I'm scared. - Don't be. - How did you get into this? - I'm not in this. I was just meeting Patrick. I would never do this to us. I need you to believe me. I had nothing to do with this. Let me talk to him. You have a very beautiful wife, my friend. And I understand that very soon you're gonna be a father. I would very much like to see that happen, but I also have the power to see that it doesn't happen. You got 30 minutes-- to put the hard drive back in the safe. You walk out of there with everything the way it was. I don't understand what you're talking about. your kid, your life, done. You understand that? I love you, too. - Very touching. - Who has my wife? The police, who else? Come on, on your way. Oh, no, don't. Don't! We need him alive! if you ever pull a stunt like that again, I will kill this woman. Yeah? Come on. As soon as we find her whereabouts, I wanna know, that clear? Can I talk to you privately for a second? - Give me a minute. - Got it. What I'm about to tell you stays between us, okay? I just found out the Feds have an informant in the diner. That informant was about to come forward with something vital to their whole operation. An active informant in the diner now? - Who is it? - I don't know, and they won't say. There's fear of a leak in the department. They gotta protect the guy. The wrong people find out who he is... well, I don't need to tell you. - Matthews. - Hear me very fucking clearly. The assholes who pulled this cannot walk out of that diner. Understood. What about Davenport? Same order. We clean this up. - Oi, where are you off to? - I need the toilet. - A number one or number two? - What? Because if it's a number two, allow me to provide you with a magazine to read. What do you want me to do? I need a piss. Hurry UP! Shots fired, shots fired! Shots fired, shots fired! The cops are trying to come in through the back! Everyone stay there and be fucking cool. Stay where you are! Nick, what's going on in there? - Nick? - Come over here. Pick up that radio. You tell them if they even try to come in here, I will execute every last hostage. The cops are trying to come in through the back, man. You promised us. People are going to die. - It was a mistake, Nick. - Let me talk to him. I'm gonna straighten it out. Stand down! Stand down! Nobody go near the damn diner! Back, get back! Get us that SUV and get us the hell outta here! Back where you were. Everyone stay calm. - All right, Bill? - Yeah, fine. You? Never better. SWAT tried to go through the back door. - Who gave the order? - Nobody ordered it. I'm in full command of this situation, you understand that? A couple of our guys went to take a look and got made. It was a mistake. Those guys don't make mistakes, they follow orders. If you're trying to go behind my back, it's gonna be a fucking problem. Oh, come on. We're in this together. So what's going on? I'm guessing it's a boy. - Yeah. - Yeah? Knew it. I have four sisters, so you learn these things. When you carry a baby low, like you, it's a boy. Bet your husband, he's happy it's a boy, I bet, huh? Yeah. SUV's here. Hey, Nick? Tell him you're gonna come out and check the SUV. Make sure there's no surprises. - I'm here. - SUV's here. Gassed up and ready to go. You owe me four hostages. I've gotta check it first. I'm coming out. I never got to have kids. I'm sorry to say. I lead a very quiet life. It gives me time to think about things. I have this clock at home that always helps me think. It's a piece of ormolu. Did you ever hear of it? It's golden, French, 1800s. It's a beautiful piece, beautiful. But guess what they call it? A death clock. It's got these two pudgy cherubs holding it. All kinds of flowers. It's very Louis XIV. Everything's plated with gold. This is back when they used mercury to plate the gold to the brass. These poor schmucks, they didn't know any better. Once a clock was plated and perfect, they'd heat up the clock to burn off the mercury, and the room that they were in would fill with poison gas. Their hands, clothes, their lungs... it was a disaster. Everyone who built these clocks-- these beautiful clocks... died. The clock makers, the apprentices, the children. Their whole families, dead. You got directions on the dashboard to a secure gate at the airport where they'll walk you through, but you still can do this another way. Is the jet ready? I have a clean shot. Waiting for a go. There's been a short delay, but it'll be ready by - the time you get to the airport. - How long? - No more than an hour. - That's too long! There's nothing I can do about that, Nick. - The jet is not there. - No, that doesn't work! What's he doing? Imagine that. Imagine a man mastering a craft that he hopes will provide for his family only to destroy everyone that he loves and kills himself, too. - Who's got my wife? - We're trying to locate her. Answer me. Where's my wife? - Amands fine, Nick. - That's bullshit! I spoke to her, someone's got her! We don't know where she is now. Jesus fucking Christ. We need him back in here. Oh, I'll just skip on out there and pull him in, shall I? - Shut up. - God damn it, I trusted you. - You lied to me. - Nicky, Nicky, Nicky, - Stand down! - Stop! It's pitiful to think about. So... I just sit staring at my clock. Do you think before the end, before his last breath, the clock maker had any idea he was killing himself and his family, too? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Nick. You wanna help these people? You go in there and you end it or someone's gonna die. We have a direct threat. Take him out. No, no, no! Oh, God! Nick! Bravo Team, you're clear to take the back door, go! Stay down! Everyone, stay down! Stay down! Stay down! Derrick, what's plan B? This. Derrick?! Derrick?! Sorry, mate. Derrick?! Let's go, let's go, let's go. Derrick, please! Put your gun down! Put your gun down! Freeze! Let me see your hands! - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. One of them's in the kitchen. He's got a hostage. Go! - Clear. - Clear. Keep your hands where I can see them! Move it, move! - Clear. - Clear. They're killing the hostages! Get in there, go! Hurry! Nick, Nick. What is going on with Amanda? Tell me what you know and we'll find her. Nick? Nick, talk to me. Nick?! Hey, that was a hostage you shot, for Christ's sake. Officers, I'll finish this up. Wow, Yuri, that was quite a fucking mess we had on our hands there. It was three Brits that came in and did this! Yeah, and Davenport was the ringleader. Your man has his wife. That kid? You've got shit for brains, Barnes. - He wasn't behind any of it. - What? Give me your phone. - It's me. - You okay? Davenport's not our guy. He's just a pawn. Whoever pulled this got the drive. Find him. What do you want me to do with the wife? - Unit three, do you copy? - Go, three. Did anyone come out the back of the diner? Uniform they had hostage. Nobody else. Do you have eyes on that individual now? - Negative. - Fuck it. Tell them to check the bathroom. - Check the bathroom. - Copy that. We've got what appears to be Will Tompkins' dead body here. He's got no shirt. Repeat, he's got no shirt. The uniform that went out the back was our perp. Find the son of a bitch. We'll get him, Yuri. We'll get him. All emergency responders, diner suspect at large driving a black and white. PD fleet two... You understand this. You got 30 minutes-- 30 minutes to put the hard drive back in the safe or your wife, your kid, your life, done. Oh, no, no, no. Come on. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Watch where you're going, you stupid bitch. You hear the siren? Are you fucking deaf? Oi, are you blind?! Watch where you're going, you stupid cow. Get off your cell phone, lady. There you go, there you go. Hey, man, come back! Mike, he just ran out! Turn around. Call everyone. I want the bastard who took the hard drive. - Hello? - All right, Barnes. I've got your hard drive, but now it's gonna cost you. - Who is this? - Who's this? Who the hell are you? You're the one who's got Lieutenant Barnes's phone, but you're not him. You're speaking to Yuri Mikhalev. That's my drive you've got. Well, then this might be both of our lucky day. Mrs. Davenport, it's over. Time to go home. Easy, mate, easy. Charlie was my friend. He bled to death in his own office. I knew him 30 years. You're that fellow with the fancy watch. Yuri Mikhalev. Christ. If I would have known it was you in there all night, I would've watched me Ps and Qs. I should kill you right now. You could do that, but then you'd never see your precious hard drive again, eh? Baby, I promise this is the last car I'm ever breaking into. As for your friend Charlie, my condolences, but I lost two of my colleagues in that royal fuck up. It's not me you should blame, it's Barnes. I am. I did. Boss, Barnes got the message. Unless you want to join him, you better give me the drive. Money first. - He probably left it in the car. - Happy hunting. Do you think I'm fucking stupid? How do I know you didn't make a copy? I barely had enough time to ditch the cruiser when I got out of that diner. Who do you think I am, Harry fucking Houdini? Oi, the money's light. This is the best I could do on such short notice. Who do you think I am? Harry Houdini? Hey, tell your dog to put that piece away. This is a family establishment. We don't want any unnecessary attention. Put it away. Barnes thought you made a deal with the FBI. - He thought you sold him out. - Barnes was an idiot. A lot of people suffered because of your actions tonight. My men almost executed the kid's wife. They were an unlucky couple. Wrong place at the wrong time. - What'd you do with 'em? - The girl has been released and now the police know Davenport had nothing to do - with what happened at the diner. - Ended up all right, then, didn't it? By the way, I am that fucking stupid. Right. Here's your hard drive. I told you I didn't want any heroes. A lot of people are dead or will go to jail because of that drive. Why don't you tell me about the gig that Charlie gave you? I-- I just had to give a message to somebody. We know who you went to see. It's on for the 12th, you got that? A friend of mine said that the police were all excited about hearing something that was on for the 12th. - So? - There was nothing on for the 12th. There was no FBI sting. That was just a test. We knew someone was giving information at the diner, we just didn't know who. It was you. You're the fuckin' rat. The FBI are gonna hit us. I want you to tell 'em it's on for the 12th. Unfortunately for my boss, once Barnes got the message, he got paranoid and set in motion the clusterfuck at the diner. Thought I'd find you here. Come in, I want you to see something. Come on, come on! Huh? - What do you think? - Hey. It's not bad. It's not bad at all. Thanks for doing this. I forgot how handy having you around can be. Sorry I doubted you, man. Recovered as evidence. Try not to lose it this time. That hard drive you gave me is gonna do a lot of good. You're in the clear, Nick. I pulled some strings. Thank you. - I'm gonna get going. - Hey, any lead on the guy who took me? No, but we'll get him. I'll see ya. Back to work. - Those are screws. - I know. - I knew that. - Ta-da. Springs. 'Cause when I'm with you  Nothing could be so cool...  As rumor has it still  I followed the rules of Frank and McNeal  So catch me if you can, there ain't people when I take off  Check me when I land, white-collar mischief  Never been caught, so if money's on your mind  Nigga, hold that thought  Daydreaming of a mil, but plottin' the same fortune  I think, "Make it rain," or maybe I'm brainstorming"  Young gettin' busy on his own like an orphan  My sentence-skillful ways equal self-made endorsements  Damn, Mr. Commodity, you are such a lottery ticket  Making these rappers seem sorry, apologies  Somebody gotta do it, I guess it's gonna be moi  I'm in a foreign Maserati, please say au revoir  Yeah, life's a bitch, Money made it up  Every now and then I like to cheat on her with Lady Luck  Push come to shove  Come to shove  Push back  Push back  Tell them I ain't going out like that  When push come to shove  Come to shove  Push back  Push back  We ain't gotta take that, homie, homie  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down, homie, homie  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Feet on pavement, grind time blisters  Entertaining the idea that I can get richer  Corrupt moves, can't explain it all like Clarissa  But it's a reason for my motives I deliver  Gucci bag straps is becoming my enigma  I'm too old for swag, I'm focused on my charisma  Saying, "Yo, why you talking like them white folks?"  I say, "I'm just shaking hands with the right folks"  Clocking overtime with the same clothes  What time you off work? when the bank close  I dated females with issues that I'm to blame for  I've fallen victim to the emotions that I ain't show  Close knitted to the cost of success  Some call it being confident, I call it being blessed  Just a minute, let me get it off my chest  See, I'm coming for what's next, y'all niggas can have the rest, wait  When push come to shove  Come to shove Push back  Push back  Tell them you ain't going out like that  When push come to shove X - Come to shove Push back  Push back  You ain't gotta take that, homie, homie  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down, homie, homie  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Get down  Standing on the stage of irrelevance  Pretending not to notice this white elephant  Taste the disconnect that leaves you feeling separate  Is this who you are? machines and programs  Ignorance  I'm standing in the face of the irrelevance  But I refuse to hide behind this white elephant  I rise against and I will not be settling  For the bullshit that they call intelligence  The things they do have salted me  The seeds that you have fed to me  They will not be injected in me  They will not be represented by me  Me, just try me  You ask me who am I, but who are you?  Who am I, but who are you?  You ask me who am I, but who are you?  Who am I, but who are you?  I know you want to prick me  But you are not the one to create me  The eternal definition of who I am  Can't be taken away, so I stay  I need to be the one with the one soul  I need to be the one whose mind will not be controlled  And it's to be the one who rise above  I am the individual  Let go You ask me who am I, but who are you?  Who am I, but who are you?  You ask me who am I, but who are you?  Who am I, but who are you?  Look in my eyes  Feel alive  Your truth inside  Alive...  Alive  Alive  You're alive  You asked me who am I, but who are you?  Who am I, but who are you?  You ask me who am I, but who are you?  Who am I, but who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?
