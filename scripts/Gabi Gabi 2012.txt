Learn the Russian language and explore the world. Yes, Father. I prepared some gabi. Oh, what a surprise... Thank you. - You love Dan. - No, I don't... - Yes, you... - No, I don't... Dan! Are you okay, sir? Protect Dan. Sir... Sir... Your dark eyes. How I love you so. How I'm scared of you. Your burning eyes. Have a good time. What's this! You must be Silver Fox! I found gold bars in those coffee sacks. They're Japanese gold. Why do Russians have these? Those Russian officers must be working for Japan. Now we have to go farther. They are Icy Fox and Silver Fox from Chosun. They speak Russian fluently. So they must have lived in Russia during childhood. Icy Fox can speak Chinese and Japanese. Silver Fox can change into anything she wants and make anything she saw. As freighters from Europe stopped coming in, they're stealing merchants' beans to sell expensive to aristocrats. After investing much money, they even created peace between gangs at borders. We can't get any information about them because the gangs won't talk. Now they even robbed Russia's military trains. Aren't you ashamed? For the honor of Russia, I'll get them executed. I want to have coffee. I'll teach you. Try making your own coffee. No, you know how I love watching you make coffee. Before leaving, let's go say goodbye to your father. Give him the coffee you make on your own. The grave of KIM Wu-hyeon I made this coffee. I know you often came here alone. Please promise my father that you'll live as my man. Run! It's Russian soldiers. Stop them! Icy Fox and Silver Fox shall be executed immediately for theft and disturbing Russian army. Fire! Turn the light on. I'm Sadako Tayama. Since I saved your life, you owe the Empire of Japan. I didn't beg for my life. You're KIM Jong-sik who followed Japanese merchants. What do you want? Tanya... she's alive. Japan paid lots of gold to Russian army to save you. If you don't obey, you and Tanya will suffer unbearable pain. Go ahead. This is enough to make any strong woman an opium addict. Stop it! Are you accepting my offer? I'll do whatever you say. Let her go. You'll become Japanese Sakamoto. And Tanya will go to Chosun as a Russian. Tanya will poison the King and Sakamoto disturb his army. When the Gabi operation begins, you shouldn't know each other. GABI Many people will attend the coronation of Russian Emperor. Chosun's King also sent MIN Yeong-hwan and envoys. That's the famous woman in Nevski Cafe. Her coffee tastes amazing and she memorizes every order. - Is that so? - Yes, it's true. - That's a rumor. - Really? She can't remember every order. - No, that's impossible. - I think it's possible. I bet she can't do it. How about betting? Betting? Yes, and let's switch our seats. Sounds fun. - Let's do it. - Call her. Hello. Ready to order? I'll have shashlyk. And wheat vodka, please. I got it. I'll have jarenaya kartoshka with mushrooms. I'll have blini. And a good cup of coffee you make. Okay. I'll have Farshirovanie Perzi. And red wine. You have borsch on the menu. Instead of coffee, I'll have vodka today. Okay. - I'll have steak and vodka. - Okay. Is that everything? Yes, that's all. Okay. So, now switch the seats. I'll sit there. You come here. - Let's move. - All right. Oh, I see. Borsch. Perzi. Here's what you ordered. Steak. - Shashlyk. - Thanks. Blini. Your vodka. Vodka. What did I tell you? Enjoy your meal. I won the bet. - Thank you. - Thanks. Now can we toast? Start conversation with envoys naturally at Nevski Cafe. You have to return to Chosun with MIN Yeong-hwan. That's already done. We'll send army to protect the King of Chosun. This is beyond what I can do. Okay. To conclude a treaty, you need money. Russia will no longer send army to Chosun. If so, Japan will not send our army, either. Russia and Japan signed a secret treaty not to send army. Japan and Russia agreed not to send their army to Chosun. Are you from Chosun? Yes. I overheard their words. I thought this could help. Forgive my rudeness. Next time, I'll save a nice spot for your meetings. I want to bring Russian army to Chosun. What should I do? Never mind. I'm just fretting. Russians don't feel comfortable with people in unfamiliar clothes. Instead of Russian army, MIN requested for instructors to train army in Chosun. Tell them the King appreciates the kindness of Emperor. How about returning to Chosun? We need a good interpreter now. It was a pleasure to help you. Without you, how would I find out Russia's intention? I'm sorry. I have my reason why I can't return to my motherland. No reason can be more important than saving your own country. I was a daughter of a court interpreter. My father died accused of stealing the King's gold bars. I haven't cleared his name yet. So I'm guilty in Chosun, too. How can I work for the country? I got help from you. That makes me guilty, too. Let's keep it secret forever. And let's work for Chosun people. Before she goes, promise me one thing. When everything ends, Tanya should become Japanese. I'll promise. Russian Minister Veber. Mrs. Sontag, the hostess of this hotel. It's nice to meet you. I'm Tanya. You speak Russian. She'll be a help to the legation. I don't know. She does speak Russian. And she's beautiful, too. KIM Hong-ryuk. He interprets for the legation. I heard you want to taste my coffee? Sontag hotel offers better coffee than Russia. Excellent. But the beans are old. I wish it had richer aroma. I heard that your coffee was very famous at Nevski street. Will you make me a cup? Sure. Light roasts give rich aroma but complicated taste. And strong roasts have stronger bitterness. You should make coffee with your heart. Soak the beans to slowly spread the aroma. Throw away useless tastes. They could ruin taste and aroma. Too much sugar could weaken coffee's various flavors. How about enjoying the bitterness for a while? This is amazing. I trust you'll keep promise to work for Chosun people. Thanks for coming back with me. After the queen was killed, King Gojong requested for help from the U.S. Legation. But we stopped his attempt to go to the U.S. Legation. Then the King seemed to surrender to us. But when the civil army rose, he ran to the Russian legation. There, he's working on his policies... Get me a full map of Chosun. Did you know that Chosun's King loves coffee? Yes. So far, Mrs. Sontag has made coffee for the King. She'll be busy with the hotel business. So, I want you to make coffee for the King now. And I want you to tell me everything about the King. Are you saying I should be a snitch? You only have to tell me his everyday life. I need fresh beans. You know how to get to the power. I got it. That Sadako is actually BAE Yu-jeong. Her father sold her to Miura for a fortune. What a bastard. What's this? Are you starting a war or something? For the sake of Japan? This is Chosun. It's our country. Then you should leave. But this is not right. Japan killed the queen and Chosun people. This is not right. Why do you think the King killed Tanya's father? The King's people always wore black clothes. That day, I heard they argued with Tanya's father. Tanya's father worked for Chosun's King. That's why he was killed by the King. The King never trusted anyone and killed his own people. Where did you learn Japanese? I used to travel with Japanese merchants. Your eyes are shining. How about working for me? To buy gabi that Tanya loves, I opened the door for them. That night, Tanya's father died. Tanya's father was killed not by the King, but by Japan. You're already on our side. Follow me. I ruined her life. I'll do everything for Tanya. The King is picky, sensitive and fickle, but very thoughtful. You're not a court lady. You can't serve His Highness. Teach the court lady how to make gabi. Minister Veber asked me to do this. Making gabi is my job. Who do you think you are! Please talk to Minister Veber to discuss things about me. Tanya! Please make some coffee. Okay. I'll go make gabi. Follow her and keep an eye on her all the time. Yes, ma'am. Your Highness, please enjoy your coffee. This coffee is popular in Russia these days. Are you wearing that thing because we're not in the court? I'm not a court lady. Ready. One, two, three, four. Can I look around Russian army? Do you speak Russian? I practiced for this. We didn't spend so much money to get a stupid thing like you! The King asked for the Japanese officer who visited Russian army. Meeting the King is part of my plan. I'll stop Chosun from making its own troops. Never act on your own without my permission. Don't forget you're also Japanese here. If you want to beat me, you should be a real Japanese. BAE Yu-jeong. I'm Japanese to the core. You should live that way, too. Never act on your own. Chosun's weaponry has a secret. I can't bring Japanese army to find it out. Miura doesn't approve any plan he doesn't know. That's how Japanese works. Where's Mrs. Sontag? She went to the hotel for urgent business. She asked me to do it. I heard gabi trees grow in hillside in tropical regions. Gabi fruits are similar to reddish cherries. Fresh gabi beans are green, and turn dark when roasted. Roasted gabi produces fruit or floral aroma. When crushed, it has spicy fragrance. When you brew gabi in water, it tastes both sour and bitter. You can taste each aroma at the tip of your tongue. Make another cup. If you don't like the aroma, I'll make another kind. No. Fill this room with gabi aroma. I'm Yusuke Sakamoto. Thank you for accepting present. Isn't Japan having a war against Taiwan? That is true. Why didn't you go to Taiwan, but come to Chosun? Japanese army needs to stay in Chosun as well. Never spy on my army again. Next time I could cut off your head with this sword. There's no army to spy on in Chosun. I just looked around how lazy Russian army is. This won't happen again. Japan is a country of sea, but Chosun of mountains. Toyotomi couldn't conquer Chosun because of those mountains. What's the secret of Chosun's weaponry? Aren't they using Japanese guns? They combined Japanese and Russian firearms. The King's buying Russian weapons. We need to find those who help the King. We'll allow no more Russian weapons. Cut the King's connections. I need information from Tanya. Get him connected to Tanya. He'll be out of control. Sadako. Water flows downward. Don't block it, but make a path for it. I'll make a path. We're doing right, aren't we? Let's finish quickly. The King has secret connections. I need to find a secret path. Can you draw a map for the inside of the legation? I'll leave it here. Westerners drink gabi in this kind of cups. Because gabi is black and tastes bitter it's used for poisoning in Western countries, too. Forgive me. I should have lighten your concerns. The King only eats canned foods and eggs because of poisoning. Everyone around the King is very loyal to him. Due to their close protection, I have nothing to report. I want to find Russian dealers who sell weapon to the King. I need information about people who meet the King privately. Those granted a private audience belong to secret society. But I can't find out more because the King doesn't open up. I heard you speak Russian well. I barely make conversations. For whom are you working for? To whom are you passing words? They say words with gabi are as light as dust. Why would I pass those words? Are you saying my words are like dust? I haven't said a word, and I won't from now on. I don't trust anyone. Your promise means nothing. KIM Hong-ryuk and Veber gave me gold bars. Then you, Russian speaker, came to me with gabi. People never pay money without getting something worth it. What are you trying to take from me? Do you still have anything to lose? Use me, Your Highness. I'll be your eyes and ears. Tanya should stay and serve gabi. MIN Yeong-hwan said that the Russian legation took money, but we haven't received new arms and guards yet. Tell Minister Veber to show me the ledger. The King asked you to strengthen vigilance around the legation. Yes, Your Highness. He says he'll do so. Did he interpret correctly? He didn't interpret your words correctly. The interpretation was wrong. Russians don't like to use direct expressions. I tried to understand your intention and convey words. She's nobody who just wandered in Russia. How'd she know diplomacy, Your Highness? And you sent me a nobody? I've already known that interpretation was incorrect. I just used you. This might put you in danger. Everyone who helps me has to risk death. You'll be my eyes and ears, so I'll protect you. You have to protect yourself. I'll think you did this to win the King's heart. If this happens again, I can't guarantee your life. Are you okay? I was worried he might take you with him. Do you know how powerful he is? Russia and Japan listen to what he says. You don't want to look him in the eyes like this. Why are you being respectful all of a sudden? Well, that's... You're older than I... Anyway, I'll ask the highest court lady to protect you. She doesn't like me. No, she said you're smart. She said you could be a court lady for His Highness. She told me not to tell... Tanya interpreted for the King against KIM Hong-ryuk and Veber. Isn't it what you wanted? Aren't you curious about her relations with the King? I planted someone inside. So, are you gonna report to me every night or something? Did Miura send you? Or you came on your own? You complicated my plans. I want to confirm you're really on our side. Tell me the story between you and Tanya. What are you doing? Tell him she's Japan's spy. She's a spy from Japan. You want to buy Russian arms? Yes. Got money? Show him. This thing looks fantastic. I'll make the deal. Okay. I'll set a trap for the King with Russian arms. I'll wipe out Secret Society and civilian army. We should stop Chosun's troops. Withdraw now. He'll not ask for you, so don't come near here. I have a favor to ask. You want to dress like a court lady? Yes. Do you know what that dress means? You'll live as the King's woman all your life. Are you sure? Yes. Where's the passage to the legation? Tell me or you'll be dead. What are you doing? I came to look at dried gabi beans. I saw someone, so I went after him. Someone was spying here? I think I saw someone. Don't chase anyone again. I told you to protect yourself. Go on. Stay there. Don't worry. She's my eyes and ears here. She's the daughter of KIM Wu-hyeon. Japan won control over Taiwan in Sino-Japanese war. And sent large troops to rule Taiwan who's fighting back hard. When Japan is in war with Taiwan, Chosun should make its army. Your Highness, but we're short of money. I'll fix the problem, so recruit 10,000 soldiers. We need at least 30,000 soldiers to be a neutral nation. Go meet civil army leaders and old army generals. Win their heart. Chosun needs them now. Tanya, read this. We appreciate the successful deal with the Chosun government. We shipped You'll receive them in 15 days. We're expecting rifle contracts. Please respond soon. Please, protect Dan. Tanya's father died for the King. The pen means he's one of Secret Society. Now I know why Japan chose Tanya. The King cannot suspect Tanya. You made Tanya so perfect so Japan wants to have her. You must have trained her so she can survive. But that changed her fate. I chose you, and I take all the responsibility. Now Tanya can't get out of there. I heard about your father from MIN Yeong-hwan. That reminded me of what happened long ago. Your father was neither an interpreter nor a criminal. He went over borders and did risky jobs for me. Like those you saw today, your father was my loyal man. To protect me, your father chose death. Why did you pretend you didn't know me? I'm a shameful King who made your father die. It was hard to confess. How have you been? Are you okay? Do you think... we can go back? It's... too hard for me. I don't know. Really I know nothing. I know you're helping the King. No, I'm just a merchant doing business at markets. I really don't know anything. Tell me where the civil army is, or these people will be dead. Go back. Move back quickly. Make your own. Your Highness, she's only a court lady. Words with gabi are like dust. So, tell me. What do my people say of me? They say you neglect them and only love money. Anything else? That you're hiding because you're afraid of Japan. They are right. I escaped the court in court ladies' sedan chair. It was a year ago. It's time to go back. I love gabi's bitterness. Ever since I became the King, everything tastes bitter. But gabi's bitterness is rather sweet. Who's the leader? I'll kill one by one until the leader comes front. Stop it. I'm the leader. You're one of Secret Society. Tell me the secret passage to the legation. Or all of your men here will be dead. Okay, I'll tell you. Bring this covertly. Go toward the court. There's a door at the end that opens to the court. Cross the court and go to the unguarded east gate. Outside, there'll be people following you. Give them the letter. Did you give it to them? Yes. What did it say? You ordered to save KIM Gu from being executed. He killed a Japanese officer to avenge the queen's murder. He did that for me. How can I let him die? Never read my letter again. The more you know, the more danger you'll be in. I don't want to lose you. You're my woman. I'll be by your side forever. I'll protect you. I need to know where the secret path leads to. I'm being watched closer. I can't find the secret path. So many civil soldiers are dying. Isn't the King too quiet? The King's focusing on the arms deal. This letter is from Tanya. Isn't it, Sakamoto? That's right. Tanya is the King's woman. She can't poison the King. We'll take care of her. Cut off the King's men, so he can't stand back. Why am I feeling you're not sincere? Why? Are you afraid of me? The King's holding a party at the Sontag Hotel. Tanya has to poison the King. Even if she fails, you can't step in. As you said, Sadako got strong opium and poison. What will happen when Tanya poisons the King? Will Japan save her? Will she get out of the legation? Once the King falls down, troops will arrive. Mrs. Sontag will be accused. As Your Highness requested, they prepared music from Paris. Please enjoy. This hotel is a gift to Mrs. Sontag for her help. All of you here are also working for Chosun. I appreciate your hard work. Your Highness, let me serve you gabi. Why didn't you do it? If I did, everyone would've suspected me. I didn't agree with that plan. I make the plan. Next time, you'll do whatever I tell you. If you don't, you'll be dead. Before that, Ilyich will be dead. General Sakamoto. I'm such an incompetent King that my people are starving. Chosun's mountains have more things to eat than in houses. That's why many people went up to mountains. They're not thieves or rebels. They're starving people. And you Japanese kill unarmed people with firearms? They're my people. If you kill them again, I'll never forgive you. What does this mean? Do you love the King? So you can't kill him? Do you know what I did to protect you? I even killed people for your sake. Just kill the King. Or you'll be dead. I can't kill him. Then I'll do it. This dress doesn't belong to you. I'll make you time to leave Chosun. There's no way I can live. Go back to Russia. If you work with Japan, you'll be in danger. Make gabi for my father. Please. When everything is over, go to Japan. The Japanese Empire needs you. For higher ambition, a man has to forget his broken love. Do you think I'll make you a spy for Chosun? That can be done by Sadako alone. Japan will wage a war against Russia. You'll be at the top position in preparing the war. Then, maybe I would have to bow before you. Gabi operation is over now. If Tanya can't kill the King, she'll be dead, too. It all depends on you. Stop the arms deal. At this time of the night... What a mean King. Tell him I'm sorry to bring him in late. The King says he's sorry to bring you in late. I'll make Chosun an Empire, and I myself will be Emperor. I understand, but... you need recognition from Japan and China and from other countries. I know Russia's supporting Chosun to win Siberia railroads. If we fail to protect ourselves, Russia can't get what it wants. If Russia approves Chosun as an Empire, other countries will follow the suit. Tanya, follow me. We need a Russian speaker at the arms deal. His Highness told us to send you. This came from Sakamoto. The King took the bait. He'll send civil army to the arms deal to stop us. I'll set a trap. Please send Japanese troops. Follow him with Japanese troops. Send the soldiers around the port quickly. Tanya's gone. The King must have sent her somewhere. The King's up to something. What if the King knows about our assassination plan? Tanya knows about us. You're the only one who can enter the coffee room. If the King doesn't die, your life will be in danger. Kill the King as soon as possible. Japan will protect you. Go to the port and prepare a boat for him. We're parting here. Tanya's going with us to the port. His Highness ordered so. Follow them. No! Why are you making gabi? Where's Tanya? I don't know. You don't know? Bring the highest court lady. Go make gabi. Where's Tanya? She came here for gabi. You can't do this behind our back. She's a court lady now. She has jobs to do besides making Gabi. It's none of your business. KIM Hong-ryuk... he poisoned gabi. Giddy up! No, Your Highness. Tanya came back. She's back. The King didn't drink coffee. Don't let Ilyich go away from the arms deal. Send someone now. All Japanese troops went there. There's no one left. I'm thinking about building a Western gabi cafe here. I promised a man. Your man came to me knowing he'll be dead. Don't move. I'll kill him. - Are you from Chosun? - I'm from nowhere. You can't get rid of your motherland. You turn to Japan and betrayed your own country. But you're still Chosun person. And do we have to die for our King? So, are you trying to eliminate Chosun by killing me? But I won't be dead. Living is so humiliating, but I have things to do. Stand back. That man provoked me. Tanya was a spy from Japan. I did everything to protect her. And she risked her life for you. What are you saying? What did you feel when you lost the queen? How dare you talk about the queen? I haven't let her go, so I didn't hold her funeral. Right now I'll focus on saving Chosun. I will protect Tanya. Now that I know everything, how would you do that? I'm not afraid of death. But Your Highness, you can't stop Japan now. I'll fight against Japan for the sake of Chosun. So please let her go. You came here for Tanya's life. How can I trust that you will keep your promise? I was the only love she had. But after she met you, she now loves Chosun. Now she'll never be happy beside me. I'll fight for her. Please trust me. Go. That man tried to protect you by giving up his life. Charge! - Move back. - Move back. It's a trap. Move back. Go! Hurry up! No! No! Seok-ju! Ilyich! Ilyich! The King returned to Deoksu Palace. He proclaimed Korean Empire and became Emperor. In the backyard of palace, Jeong-gwan-heon was built, spreading gabi aroma. For one man, gabi meant love. For another man, gabi meant dream for empire. JEONG-GWAN-HEON - A place for serene gaze
