She's getting on my fucking nerves. - You got any T on you? - No, I don't. Are you sure? Yes, I am sure! You're making me lose my game. This is what the fuck I'm dealing with. I cannot take it no more. - Bye. - Bye. Girl, wait, wait, wait. I cannot do this. I cannot do this, it's too much drama. You just come out here and give me all this information. To have me go handle it by myself. You're the one who told me anyways. OK, OK, OK! I will go with you under one condition. You must promise to me that there's not gonna be any drama. Because as soon as there's some drama, I'm out of there! I promise. I promise. Look at me in my eyes and promise! I promise no drama, Alexandra! Come on! What the fuck you two looking at? Bitch, like I am clockable! You can't get it on me, bitch, you can't get it on me, bitch. I am fierce as fuck. I don't know what the fuck she was tripping on, girl. True. 1351 Orange? - Yes, please. - Alright. Is that a dog or a cat? A dog. What's the name? Alfie. Alfie is a very well behaved dog, huh? It's so quiet. It's empty. And his breath always smells like he's been eating ass for days! I mean when I walk into the room, it shouldn't always smell like homeless. And those socks, why are those socks so fucking black! That's not a pimp. What do you see in him? Why are you looking for him? Girl, you right! You right! It ain't his ass I should be worried about. It should be that bitch. She's the one trying to come on my man. Bitch, you're smart! I'm gonna fuck her up! - That's not what I meant! - That's exactly what you meant! Because that bitch wants to try with me. - I didn't mean that! - I can give pussy, it's called a fucking tuck. Oh, my God! Look, there's Sin-Dee! I haven't seen her for so long, girl. She's looking good! Oh, girl! What's up? What's the T? Sin-Dee! Oh, my God. So how was it, bitch? Tell me the T! Did you get a lot of trade up in there or what? I want you guys to come to my show tonight. I am so excited about that! T was the night before Alexandra. Stunning goddess... 7:00pm sharp! Has any of you motherfuckers seen Chester? - No, not me. - Here we go again. Girl, she saw hisself trying to cheat on me. While I'm up in there, girl! Me, bitch! - I wish I never told her. - I heard about that fish. And who the fuck is she? Desiree! Sounds like Desiree. Girl, do you really want to go back to prison? You just got out, mama. I told her that too. He act like prison is a bad place to go. Mama, mama, you are so much better than she is. Look. My boyfriend, my husband. Ok, that's fine. But he's not with you. He's with her. He left you for her the minute you went to jail. - Girl, I am so mad. - Why don't you just stop? - I don't know what else to say. - The only thing I can say is this. Get that motherfucker! Oh, girl. Another black boy on a board. They all think they are goddamn Lil Wayne. I remember one Christmas, I was like six or seven, my family bought me the cutest little Barney doll, that I would take with me everywhere. And one day I put it inside the tub with me, - to give it a bath. - Oh, girl, she tried her out. And it just stopped working. It stopped singing the "I love you" song. And I was just so upset. The world can be a cruel place. Yeah, it is cruel. God gave me a penis. That's pretty damn cruel, don't you think? You speak English pretty good. Where are you from? I'm Armenian. Yeah I knew some people, came from Armenia. Brought a lot of jewelry with them, when they got out. They lived on that jewelry, had a restaurant. What part of Armenia? From the capital. From Yerevan. Shit. I'm from Oklahoma, and I am a Cherokee Indian. I got... I got a girl's name, Mia. But, it's a feminine name in English, but it's not in Cherokee. I was named like all Indian Cherokee babies are named. First thing the mother sees when the baby is born she names that fucking baby. So when I was born, my mama looked out the window, and she seen a red bird, flying overhead in the sky. Cherokee Indian name for red bird is Mia Mia. So, she called me Mia. If you think that's a girl's name, it's not. I'm glad she didn't look out the window and see an outhouse. Can you imagine? Look, hey, here comes "Big Shit Thompson!" Right down the goddamn street. Here he comes. Oh, fuck. - You OK? - I don't know. You got any aspirin? - No. - Oh, fuck. - Is this Sunset Boulevard? - Yeah. You said you are going downtown, right? Yeah. I'm in no hurry. I'm gonna take 101, OK? I don't give a shit. You do what you want to do. You're the driver. Remember, Sin-Dee. No drama! Yeah, no drama. Hello. Hey, Mila, did you see Nash? That little negro. In the back. Girl. Nash! Hi, Nash! Girl, girl, it's Nash, girl! What's up, Sin-Dee. How are you doing? - I haven't seen you forever. - Yeah. It's been a long time. It's cool. I'm glad you're out and everything. Look at this, business is booming today. Yes! How can I help you? I just haven't seen you in a long time. You are... Chester. I haven't seen Chester in a long time, either. Me, neither. He's been hanging out with my new friend. Her name is Dani. Something Dominique... Desiree... No, I ain't seen her, sorry. Well. Listen, Sin-Dee. It's good seeing you, but... No, no, no, no. You know where the fuck she is. So stop lying to me Nash. And tell me where the fuck she is... Sin-Dee, just calm down. I ain't seen nobody. This is a place for business, I am trying to... You know who the fuck I am talking about? Tell me where the fuck she is. - Listen! First of all... - OK. Get some Tic-Tacs. Number two, I don't know who the fuck you are talking about. This is my place of business. And you are fucking my shit up right now. Oh, shut the fuck up you lackey ass bitch! - Where the fuck is she? - I ain't telling you shit. And you need to get the fuck out of here! Look, I'm not doing this! I'm out of here. Cause you know... I told you, I already told you! Bye! Girl! Alexandra, girl! Hold on! Just one more minute... Would you just go with your homeboy and get the fuck out of here? Oh, now you want to talk shit? I'm not going nowhere! - I don't know who... - Where are they? I don't support that pimping shit. I stay on my side of the business. I am morally opposed to the pimping shit. So, listen. Don't ask me shit like that. - Alright, listen, listen. - Hello? Half of the city is down at Schrader. There is a food line and they are giving away $20 Christmas gift certificate. Some shit like that, alright? - Schrader! - Food line! Thank you! Alright, come on, man! For real? Looks like you need a new pack. Anybody have a lighter? Anybody have a lighter?

She comes back, takes a piece of broccoli, eats it and was like... "Oh, I don't think I like this." And I'm like, "You haven't even eaten any food yet." So that was the beginning of it. - After lunch... - You stay with her, okay. I stay with her, we go outside. Next door, to the coffee shop. I get Thai iced teas. And I put them down. - She drinks out of my straw. - Nice. Just classy, huh? - Wait a minute. - Oh, speaking of classy. - Nice, Oh, jeez. - Oh, boy. - Fucking Alexander. - Oh, boy. - Have you not worked with Alexander? - No. - Please help me. - Get off the car. - Off the fucking car. - Get off me, help.

So a random woman just grabs you and attacks you. - Yes. - Yes. Check the pulse. Alexander. Girl, what the fuck? You know I don't do that shit. I don't know. What's happening? - He owes me money. - I don't owe you money. - Forty dollars. - Forty dollars? I don't even know her. - Why does he owe you $40? - He knows me very well. Ask him. Is that your green Passat? Yeah. Well we have seen you cruising around for at least 45 minutes. - I... - So you didn't just park it - and come down - I just... I... Like ten minutes ago I was driving around. - I was on the phone. I realized... - I've seen it. You know what, sir? I shouldn't be talking and driving the car. That's it. That's it. Why does he owe you money? We made a business transaction. A business transaction? OK. This is what's gonna happen. It's Christmas Eve. We'll all go our separate ways. Because I think that's a lot easier than calling our family and trying to explain why we have to be bailed out of jail. What family? Yeah. We know. You posted a lot at the center. Yes. At Mary's. - 7:00pm. - 7:00. OK. Thank you girls. I'll see you there. No, no, no. - Can I help you? - You working? - Are you a cop? - No, no. Get in. Make a right, right here on Las Palmas.

Scotty? What number is the party room? So, me and my sisters... Every weekend we would go down to this skating rink, and every Friday night they would have like a disco theme, but you would have to bring, like, a guy...
