Kick me down the stairs. Are you clear? Yes, sir. "Student Killed In Multiple Stabbing" "New Breakthrough. Student's Body Found In Luggage" The killer is the ice-cream shop owner! Arrest him! "Detective Bun Solves Another Murder Mystery" Chief. This is our farewell present for your retirement. Thank you. Happy retirement, sir. Thank you. I have to pee. What is it? Lose something? My wallet. You sure? It was in my pocket. It's probably in the gaps. Is this it? Thank you. Happens all the time. Nothing new. Are you kidding? You stole $1000 from me. You're crazy. I withdrew 10 grand today. This receipt can prove it. Are you accusing me? Call dispatch. It must have been you who stole my watch last time! Call our guys to come and investigate! The station keeps losing stuff. You're the thief. Call dispatch now! Police! Stay where you are! Freeze! "Police Officer Wong Still Missing After 18 Months" Dark chocolate? No, the one with nuts. This one has peanuts. I want almond. But it's out of stock. You've always wanted it. Kitty and Fay have it. You should too. Save the money for karaoke. Steal it when nobody sees you. Put it in your bag. Stop encouraging her to steal! I'm talking to you! You! Stop acting. I know you don't cry. I saw a girl in school uniform... No one sees what you see! But I have a gift. Everyone thinks you are crazy. I want to help people. You were fired from the force. No one needs your help. Bun. I'm Ho, of Regional Crime Unit. I don't know you. I want your opinion on a case. What's the case? Have you heard about Officer Wong's disappearance? Go on. Wong and his partner, Chi-wai, pursued a thief into the forest. Wong disappeared with his gun. But Chi-wai survived. A few months later, several armed robberies took place. Two of which resulted in murders. The bullets fired matched Wong's gun. Other divisions have investigated it. Now I'm in charge. I've been investigating for months. But found no leads. Why should I help you? You're a cop. I'm not. If you can't solve it, how can I? I've read all your cases. Whenever I get stuck, I'd imagine how you'd investigate it. Last year, my gun was defected. HQ issued me another one. It used to belong to you. I think of you as my master. Bun! I know you're upset. You promised me. Go back to cooking. We'll talk later. No. Go back... No! Go back to cooking! Get out! My husband won't help you! Solve your own case. Please stop... He's no longer a cop! Leave him alone! Please don't, honey! Leave. Please stop... Listen to me... Please don't, honey... You promised not to get involved again. I have a feeling that it'll kill you. It won't. It will! I'd rather die... than live miserably. I've been so unhappy. a masked gunman robbed $80,000 from a mahjong parlor. He didn't fire a single shot. The surveillance camera shows... he had a.38 police pistol. held up an armored truck. He killed 3 security guards and took $1.7 million. The bullets matched Wong's gun. A week later, at a convenience store... Why bother asking a maniac for help? Another gunman... another gunman robbed $6,000... A sales clerk was killed. The bullets fired matched... There's no way in hell he'll solve the case! What a waste of time! What are you looking at? You maniac! Watch it! He's going to... drag us all into trouble. I'm going to kick your ass! Bun, do you recognize me? I was working for another team. I've always wanted to transfer to yours! Shut up! I hear and see you, bitch! Damn you, you're nuts! That's all for today. I can see the inner personalities of a person. Do you have Chi-wai's statement? Wong and I waited for 5 hours. The subject arrived in a white van. We suspected him to be the thief. It was too dark to see him clearly. When we approached him, he ran into the forest. Wong and I got separated during the pursuit. I tried calling Wong... but never got through. When dawn broke, I found my own way out. Shark's fin soup, steamed fish, half of a roasted chicken, and a bowl of rice. Yes. Thank you! Fried rice please. Yes. Go and talk to him. Chi-wai, can we talk? Who are you? I'm Ho, of Regional Crime Unit. I want to discuss Wong's disappearance. Isn't OCTB investigating it? Isn't OCTB investigating it? Just being nosy. Do you have any thoughts? I believe Wong is already dead. I believe Wong is already dead. After I lost sight of him that night, he must've run into the thief. The thief killed him. The thief killed him, and used his gun to commit robberies. And used his gun to commit robberies. I've known Wong for a long time. I've known Wong for a long time. Since we were rookies. Now he's disappeared. I want to find him whether dead or alive. Thank you. Enjoy your meal. Got to pee. What's the problem? Don't fire the gun! Don't! You can't fire the gun! You can't fire the gun! Police! He's my partner! I'm tired of how long this investigation has been going. I am in debt... I am in debt. I'm a big spender. But it doesn't mean I'd kill Wong! I'm a cop too. Why won't you trust one of your own? Fatso. Why can't you fire the gun? He can see us! Nonsense! Chi-wai has 7 inner personalities! One of them is deadly. The woman is the brain. The fatso is a glutton and a coward! I've never seen so many personalities. Chi-wai is a complex person! Bun, you're hurt. Why did the fatso say... they can't fire the gun? Police investigation. Excuse us. You brought my gun to me. Police pistol plays a critical role in this case. I know, the gun was involved in so many crimes... You got it all wrong! Apply emotions to investigate! Not logic! Hold up! Again? Everyone get down! Everyone get down! Police investigation! Hold up! Sorry guys. Give me all your money. Bun, any leads? We have 2 suspects, there are 2 guns involved. One person robbed the armored truck and convenience store. This person is a ruthless murderer. The other didn't kill when he robbed the mahjong parlor... Not as bad compared... Look. It's a sign! God is telling us we're on the right track! Thank you! But why would a high-stakes criminal... waste time on a convenience store? Because he has 7 personalities! But what's the identity of the other gunman? Where did his gun come from? Honey, I'm almost done. Let's eat out. I'm working. I'll call you back. Bring your girlfriend along. Reserve a table for 4. I'll pick you up from home. Bun. Let's get a bigger table. Set a table for us outside. Yes. Relax. This is my girlfriend, Gigi. She's in the Anti-Triad Department. Nice to meet you. I once worked there too. My wife said she worked there too. Waiter. Yes? Open some wine. You decide the course. We only want the best. My wife doesn't eat beef, remember? Of course! Yours? Yes. I once had one too. Really? How about a spin? No. You haven't driven for a while. And your license has expired. Please, honey. No. I'll drive you. Be right back. Sit tight! She can't see us anymore! How long have you known Bun? Bun used to come here with his wife on his motorcycle. Then he started coming by himself. But said he was with his wife. I didn't ask questions. I assumed his wife died. You know he's... Nice ride! You drove! Hold on tight! My hair's a mess! I'm going to the restroom. I'll bring you. No, it's alright. Believe me, it's hard to find. It's okay... Really, I'll find it myself. It's here. Thanks. It's an honor to be working with Bun. He has a unique way of investigating. Can you see her? Just trying. Thanks for coming to my husband. He's become a happier man. Why did you offer your ear to Chief? It was a present. Chief has no inner personalities. How about me? Wong is dead. How do you know? He's here. Buried in mud. For 18 months, police and citizens searched the forest many times. I also camped here for 2 weeks. Nothing was found. I tried to imagine what you would do. I'd bury myself. Bury me. Let me try. You're not me. Let me try. It's not easy to be me. Give me your gun. What are you looking for? Are you looking for this? You can see me? I've been lost for a long time. I can't find my way out. No one could see me or hear me. I've been here... for 18 months. Do you know who I am? You're Chi-wai. You're a cop. Why am I here? On March 14th 2006, you and your partner Wong pursued a thief into this forest. Then you murdered Wong. Why? I don't know yet. It's probably connected to your gun. You also murdered 4 other people. And a sales clerk. Bun! Bun! Bun! He's a nut case. Leave him alone. Bun! Open the door! "Female Body Found In Cement Concrete" "Taiwanese Gives Himself In" Hands on head! Hands on head! I'm Inspector Cheung. You're under arrest for breaking in private property. Are you Bun's wife? Where did you get the handcuffs? My name is Ho. I'm from Regional Crime Unit. Where's your badge? In my car. And your gun? In my locker at the station. My badge number is 57005. Call RCU if you don't believe me. Bun is my ex-husband. What do you want from him? Why are you here? His psychiatrist said he hasn't check up for 6 months. No one answered when I knocked. I came in to see if he was dead. Did he claim he could see people's inner personalities? Or that God would give him signs? He thinks we're still together. Bun is mentally ill. He hasn't been taking his medication. He's nuts. You'd better stay away from him. Waitress. May I take your order? Shark's fin soup, Yes. Steamed fish, Yes. Half of a roasted chicken, Yes. And a bowl of rice. Thank you. Shark's fin soup, steamed fish, half of a roasted chicken, and a bowl of rice. Waitress. Shark's fin soup, steamed fish, half of a roasted chicken, and a bowl of rice. I'm Ho, from Regional Crime Unit. I'm looking for Chi-wai. He's not answering. Call again. What case is Chi-wai working on? In this district, it's usually robberies, fraud, or domestic affairs. What case is Chi-wai working on? Why is he investigating the Indians? In this district, it's usually robberies, fraud, or domestic affairs. Found him yet? How often do you inspect your men's guns? Once every week. What's your inspection procedure? Show me. We'd check the gun's number against the Arms Inspection Record. Does he follow the procedure? It's standard procedure. But our district is more relaxed. We believe in our people. They are not thieves. CHI-WAI Where's the suspect? What did you lose? My pistol. That's serious. Where did you lose it? How should I know. I almost caught the thief. Did the thief take it? No. I hope not. What are you doing? Reporting to dispatch. We won't find it in the dark. Don't! It'll ruin my record. We'll be in bigger trouble if the thief has it. I'm getting promoted. Buddy... Report to dispatch. Let them follow up. We may still be able to intercept the van. Why did you kill him? If I don't kill him, he'll report on me. You can't just take his gun, it has a serial number. Is this Regional Crime Unit? I want to report seeing an Indian with a gun on Hung To Road. Just take the gun, don't kill any more. The more complicated the story, the better for us. Sir, are you okay? What's the status? We received an anonymous call today. Someone saw an Indian with a gun on the third floor. Get everyone ready to move. Yes, sir. Action! Looks like the lead is good. Search around. Yes, sir! Where is your gun? Where is your gun? Lost it! Where is your gun? Lost it... Where is your gun? Lost it! Chi-wai killed Wong... and took his gun. The Indian found Chi-Wai's gun. Chi-wai will kill the Indian and take his gun back. Where are you? I'm on Wai Yip Street. I'm on Hung To Road. Turn on Hau Ming Street. Have you seen a weak boy? No. Chi-wai will kill the boy. I can see you. I saw a boy. Where are you? What are you talking about? I'm right behind you. You almost ran over me! Give my badge and gun back! What's going on? What happened to you? You got me into big trouble. Don't be confused! We've solved the case already. I saw the masked man, but I couldn't catch him. Trust me. It's Chi-wai. He's responsible for everything. No. We received a call, an Indian had a police gun. It's a set up. Chi-wai wants to complicate the case. I saw the armored boxes, the masks... I'm scared. I don't want to play anymore... He has lost faith in you. Return his gun and walk away. Quiet! I really regret asking you for help. We can go and make the arrest together. He's frightened. Leave before he kills you! Leave me alone! I'm scared. You're nuts. Your wife is no longer with you. You're seeing an illusion! I saw your real wife at your home. She's a police inspector. Why don't you return his gun? I can't let this go. Do you have to continue the case? Yes. Madam. Has Bun been here lately? He was just here yesterday. Call me if he comes again. Okay. Give me a coffee. Sure. Would you drink some wine? Have you seen my wife? Come with me. Psychiatrist said you haven't been checking up. It's not my business. But I still have sympathies. She's evil. Bun! Walk away from her. Who is she? Don't ask! Get in the car. Stop messing with him! Leave him alone! I've been on this homicide for 6 months. But found no leads. Tell me who did it. Who is she? I'm your wife. We married in 1996 in Hawaii. After I left you, you invented this person in your mind. She doesn't exist! Get her to leave... The killer is the nephew. Thank you. What have I become in your eyes? Someone selfish and cold-hearted? You think everyone is selfish and has inner personalities. Actually, you're the problem! Bun is not the problem. Let it go. You are the problem. He will get killed... Forget it! She can't see you. Take care. Are you alright? Where did you go? I heard you walked off during operation. I was buried alive. I couldn't breathe. It was unbearable. Bun took my gun. He refused to give it back to me. I saw Bun's wife. She's alive. Bun took my gun. Wait! Calm down. Why did he take your gun? Don't know. He also took my badge. Bun insists Chi-wai did it. What if he commits a crime with my gun? I've got to report the loss. Stop! You're going to get promoted next month. It'll ruin your record. You've maintained a perfect record so far. Don't let this... ruin your career. Lend me your gun. File a missing badge report for me. I'll go see Chi-wai. I'm Ho from Regional Crime Unit. I'm looking for Chi-wai. Ho is also your name? What's your unit's number? Who's the man with the bandaged head? Is he one of ours? What gives him the right to investigate me? Talk. Got questions? Wondering where I got my money from? I won it from horse races. Check the books if you don't believe it. Wondering why I investigate Indians? Wong's death isn't my case, but I still want to solve it. I didn't get a good look of the thief. But I could make out his physique. I want to see your gun. Show me yours first! I want to see your gun! No! Not unless you're my boss. You're under arrest for the murder of Wong. What's your proof? What's the serial number of Chi-wai's gun? What's the number? Boss Yes. Leave us alone. This investigation is driving everyone crazy. Can I have a cup of water? Yes... I got it, thank you. I just got a lead on the Indian thief. Want to make the arrest together? Bun is your partner? Didn't he cut off his own ear? Why ask him for help? He used to be a great detective. Why does he suspect me? He said he could see a person's inner personalities. He said you have 7. What about you? What did he see in you? A weak boy. "Be careful of Chi-wai. He'll kill you when he gets his gun from the Indian!" "He'll kill you." He did kill Wong, and used his gun for the robberies. Chi-wai killed his partner. He's holding Wong's gun. The Indian is holding Chi-wai's gun. When Chi-wai gets his gun back, he'll kill the Indian and you. Put your gun down. Put your gun down. Chi-wai killed his partner. He's holding Wong's gun. His gun is with the Indian. When Chi-wai gets his gun from the Indian, he'll kill you... and me. You saw the Arms Inspection Record. The serial number is correct. He changed the record! You're not a cop. Why do you have a gun? Does it belong to Ho? Whose gun are you holding? He killed the man in the forest! You killed my partner, and used his gun for the robberies. Your gun belongs to Wong. He killed the man in the forest! You're under arrest for armed robberies and the murder of Wong. Drop the gun. If you shoot, you'll be no different from everyone else. I'm human too. Why should I be any different? The case is over. Call Gigi, then think of how the story should be pieced together. Gigi, I got the gun back and I solved the case. But I have a slight problem. I fired your gun. You have to be at the scene. Come quick. The address is Don't tell anyone.
