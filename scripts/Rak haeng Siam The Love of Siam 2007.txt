Come on, give it to aunty. (sigh) My grandson... Do you want to move to Rayong with papa? No. Why would I? They wouldn't want me to stay with them. It's not like that. They see you as a big boy now, they let you stay here to help take care of your grandma. Well, why don't we move there together? I'm not going... I'm too old now. I don't want to move anywhere anymore. You are selfish. I can't make it. - Can you do it? - No. Show me how to do it. Here. Watch me do this. - See? ...you see? Do you have to blow it very hard? Ok, we can do it together... One, Two. - (Pffffffff) - Ooops. Oh. I can't make a bubble. Why are you so bad at it? You got it there. Come here. - Here... Here... - No. No. No! No! (crying) Grandma. Grandma. Oohh. Roasted chicken. Roasted chicken. It's my favorite. Umm... who will lead our prayer? Oh come on ... Again? Ok. Let the one who came late do it. Ohh. (Sunee) What are you chewing, Tong? Are you chewing bubble gum again ? Spit it out. Now. Here... Spit it out. How may times have I told you not to chew gum? What if it gets stuck in your throat? Tang, you never teach your brother. Ok, he got it out. It's ok. Just let it go. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Dear Lord. Please bless us and the food we have. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Grandma? Grandma? You're upset with me, aren't you? Grandma? (sigh) What are you playing, huh? You are breaking grandpa's piano. Let me sit. Let me show you how to play it. Why do you like this song so much? Your grandpa used to play it for me. He must have been good at it. Of course he was. Do you want to play as good as him? I don't know why I have to be good at playing the piano. Maybe one day. You can use it to show how you feel to others. the same way your grandpa showed me. So what did he show you? Just listen. He was saying that he missed you when he came home and nobody was here. He would be so lonely. Would you accompany me for a while? [playing football soccer] Where should we go? I don't know. Hey, hey... Stop. Isn't that Mew? - The good pianist - The sissy boy. Hey. Mew. [whistles] - Hey. Let's do it again. - Let's try. How big is your wiener? Can we see it? Hey. Hey! Hey, get out of here, leave him alone. Bastard. We'll get you too. Here. Here! Stop playing. So, do you think you can handle it? Of course I can. They're here. You're in big trouble. We're back. Are you just going sit there or are you gonna help us? - Here. I'll help... - Tong. Get up and help. - You're not moving at all. - Oh. You bought an awful lot of stuff. Oh, I forgot to tell you. I have some work in Chiangmai. This weekend, we'll all go there. Chiangmai? - Yeah. - Mom, we are going to Chiangmai. - Here. We got you a shirt. - Here. Tong. Why are you wearing sun glasses? Ahh. I want to be as handsome as you, dad. You wanna be handsome? Here. Your shirt. - It's so cute. - It fits you perfectly. Aww. Purple. But I don't like purple. It's yellow. Here, it's Purple. Yellow! Take those glasses off and look. Ah. Ah. Take these. Umm. What happened to your eye? - (Tong) Soccer ball hit my face. - (Mew) Softball. So which is it? - (Tong) Softball! - (Mew) Soccer ball hit his face! Are you sure it was a soccer ball? Of course. It's soccer ball. Really. Yes. It was a soccer ball. Do you want to match the other side? (Sunee) Tang, are you ready? Yes. Oh. Why are you taking so much? Umm. Umm. Mom. Can I stay longer with my friends? Just a couple more days. I've already asked dad. and he told me to ask you. Please mom. Please. Please. It's ok. She's a big girl now. Let her go with friends, it is ok. Hey. What's up? I'm back. - Was it good? - Err. It was kind of fun. I got you something. That is for your grandma. For Mew. If you want it, you have to... here take this first. What is this? the little sweet palm in the garden? What is it? I don't know. You have to go look for it. Behind you. That way. That way. Behind? (Mew) Why do you have to make this so difficult? - Aww. - You don't like it? I didn't say that. It's fun. (Mew) Where did you get this game from? (Tong) Oh. From my dad. At home, when we are giving gifts. That's just how he is. Your family is so fun. ["Slanted tree by the river"] Go! Go. Go! Let's go. [Truck removes tree] Ohh. Too bad. That was the last piece. It's ok. I'm just happy that you bought this for me. (Korn) Are you sure? Just ask your mom yourself, ok? What is it? When are you arriving? (Tang) Not yet. Err. I think. But you said you're coming back today. (Tang) Just a little longer, mom. On the 24th, I will be back home Please. Ok Ok. If you are tricky like this again, I won't let you travel anymore. Thank you. It's ok. She's a grown up. Let her go sometimes. You let her do things like this They're only girls Aren't you worried about her? [Silent Night] Silent Night, Holy Night. Wondrous star, Lend the light With the angel, let us sing Hallelujah to our king Christ the Savior is born Christ the Savior is born (crowded) Hello. Grandma. Over there. (Sunee on the phone) I'm not finished yet, son. Are you with Mew? Go home with his grandma first. (Tong) Yes. Yes. It's fine. Tong. Let's take some pictures. Come here. Take one with Mew. Ok. Closer, closer. Ok. Smile. (Tong) Dear our lady Mary gave birth as a virgin to the Messiah, Our Lord Jesus. Virgin Mary, please pray for us now, and when we die. Amen In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Tong. When we went to Chiangmai Tang went hiking with her friends at Kun Yuam Mountain. (sigh) She may gotten away from the group and she may be lost. Tang might got lost. (Tong) But the jungle is so big... She might not be able to come home again... So what are you going to do, Tong? (Mew) He said they are still waiting for her. Grandma, do you think Tang's going to be alright? We shouldn't have let her go. If only we'd stopped her. In the name of the Father and of the Son. Tong. We don't have to. Sunee. Tong. Mew. We have decided to move. (Mew) You're not waiting for Tang anymore? [Engine starts] [music] Have you heard that there is a place? If we get there, we will have everything. It will wait for us at the end of the way. And we need only one ticket. We can go and come back many times. What will you tell me when you come back? [music] I'm wondering if it's true. I want to see it. Even if I have to go by foot. If there's something when I get there. Even if the ticket is so expensive. Whatever I have to pay, I'll get it. I have paid all I have for someone to tell me that this ticket is not for me. Oh mom, wait. This train doesn't have a seat for me. Why not? I want to listen to this song first. I don't have the right to go. - Do you have a session after school? - Of course. When do you want me to pick you up? Umm. Let me call you. Jeng, take the bag for me. Take the phone too. Ok. Ok. [phone ringing] Tong. Tong. Hey Tong! [phone ringing] Ok. See you tonight. [phone ringing] Forget something? Don't drink too much. I know. - Who are you looking for? - Mew. Over there... Mew, Aex... hello. How are you? This morning, did you hear our song playing all over the school? Yes. So, what did Aod say? He said. Hey wait. Wait, wait. You two pay attention to me. Umm. Your songs are really good. But I want to tell you something. In terms of the content, it should be more universal, so that more people can listen to this. A little more than now. But quite a few people like it already, Aod. Yes, but only a small number. Let me ask you this. Don't you want a lot of people to listen to your songs? The melody, it is really very good and you are very good at it, and I have the same idea that you have. To bring in new kinds of sounds to the music industry. That's right, and that's very good. But why don't we make this easier? If the contents of the song appeal to more people, and they can relate their feelings to the songs, it will definitely be better. Like how? Love, Mew. of all the charts, are all love songs. And it should be easy for people your age. It's so easy for young people to write love songs. Really? Yes. Believe me. Let's try. Aod. Ahh. June, come in. Yes. This is June. Hello. From now on, everything from practicing to your work schedules, you discuss it with June directly. She will give you her cellphone number. Back to our issue. About love songs. I need one from you soon, ok? So we can use it as your new single. When can we expect it, Mew? Umm. Why don't you take my calls lately? Sometimes I was in class and other times I am playing soccer. Playing soccer? Tong, you have been so cold to Donut, lately. Really? What are you thinking, Tong? Tong, do you still want to go out with me? I, don't know. Why, Tong? Tong, don't you have feelings for Donut anymore? June is so pretty. Right. Where are you going? June looks like someone I used to know. - Who's that? - Mew. I don't know. - Mew? - Yes. - Hey, hey. Listen. - Can I call June for you tomorrow? - You're so you. - Our CD is sold out! - What? What? Our new CD? It's sold out. Aren't you happy? Yeah. If it's doing well already, why would we have to change the contents? Let's discuss that later. Let's go practice. Excuse me, do you have an album from August's band? Ahh. We just sold out. The artists who made it just came through here a minute ago. There they are, go ask them. They just walked away. You can go and ask them. Tong, is that you? - Is it you, Mew? - Yes. Hey... how have you been? I haven't seen you in a long time. Just so so. Not doing much. - Ok. - What about you, Tong? Same here. Are you in August band? Yes, I'm lead singer for them. August Band. Hello. - Tong, how did you know? - Ahh. The guy at the store told me. I'm came to buy your CD but it's sold out. Oh yes. But I can make a copy for you. Hey, it's ok, Mew. I can buy it from a store. Ohh. But if you want to buy it, you'll have to wait for a long time because we're not making that version anymore. What should we do? Give me your cellphone number. I will burn a CD at home and give it to you tomorrow. Ok. Ok. The number is 0-8-3. - 9-0-1. - Hey Mew. I'll call you then. [phone ringing] (Sunee) How was your class? It was fine, mom. What subject was it? Chemistry. And you understood it? Of course. Why? Your text books are still on the back seat. Today's class was on video and we got handouts. Are you sure you went to class? Yes, I'm sure. What's the matter with you? You look unhappy. My mom nags me all the time. Whatever I do, she just nags, nags, nags. (chuckle) So what did you do this time, Ying? I didn't do anything. Mew. What are you doing? Writing a song. Really? What is it about? It's about, Love. Love. That shouldn't be so hard. Umm. I don't know. I, I, I've never been in love... Mew, you don't have a girlfriend? (chuckles) Really, Mew? Really? Mew, you don't have a girlfriend, do you? Mew, really? Ok, that's enough. I don't want to talk about this anymore. Well, if you want to know what it's like to have a lover, I can be your girlfriend. Would that be ok? You're crazy. - What. Why? - No! (Mama) Ying. (Mama speaks Chinese) Ying, where are you? - I gotta go, Mew. - Ok. Just think about it, ok? Everybody needs someone. I'll think about it. Tong, wait. Get a plate for Tang. Tang is not here. She will not be coming back. [Hiccup] [phone ringing] Who's this? It's me, Mew. Oh, Mew. What's up? Umm. About the CD. I'll give it to you at Siam Square tomorrow. Ok. Ok. About what time? The evening. - [Hiccup] - Hello? - Tong. - Hey Mew. I'll have to call you back tomorrow. Ok. Talk to you then. [hang up] [Hiccup] [Hiccup] [Hiccup] [Hiccup] [Hiccup] You haven't taken a shower yet? I was just about to. [Hiccup] [Hiccup] [Hiccup] Hey. What's the matter with you? Something stuck in your throat? Tong. I heard you had a fight with Donut yesterday? Where did you hear that? I chatted with her friend on MSN last night. What did she say? She said you're a big bastard. You don't treat her right. Ahh. I think now that you got her, you wanna leave her. I don't understand you. Donut is so pretty. She could choose anyone. But she chose you. Why don't you treat her a little better? I don't know. I am what I am. She just doesn't understand. Because you are like this. Let me be straight with you. Do you want to break up with her? [phone ringing] Hello. Donut? Well. We will do it like a lucky draw. To see what kind of first aid you have to perform. - Banjong. - Yes, teacher. Pick one. Got one. (teacher) Quick. CPR. What's that? Ehh. I taught you. You don't remember anything, huh? Maybe I should I just let you fail. But I don't know. Should I really? Ahh. Or would you like a Zero? - Stay still - Aa. Aa. (friends) Whoo ooh!! (teacher) Hey. Shhh. Don't close your eyes. You animal. Eww. Mew. Why did you put your tongue in my mouth? What are you talkin about? I didn't. You put it in. Eww. Waa. What's this? Eww. Waa. Your saliva. Umm. Aex, where is Mew? I don't know. Hey Aex, I heard you passionately kissed Mew on the lips. Bastard, I asked you nicely. [phone ringing] (The number you're calling) (is not available.) [dialing] [phone ringing] (The number you're calling) (is not available.) [hang up] You still keeping this? Huh. - Mew. - Huh. Can you play that song for me? Which one? The one you played when we were kids. Umm. [playing grandma's song] This one? Someone moved into that place? Huh. Have you even seen her here? Who's that? Oh no, Nothing. (Mew) You haven't forgotten about her? Tong, if you had a chance to see Tang again, what would you say to her? I don't know. I might ask, 'why?'. Why? Why did she leave us like this? (sigh) It's not her fault, Tong. [knocking] Oh, you've got a friend here? Oh, I thought I would ask to borrow your dictionary. I can come back later. Hey. It's ok. It's ok, Mew. It's time for me to go, anyway. Let me walk you to the door. It's ok. Find a dictionary for her first. I'm going. Your friend is cute. Aah. Ying. (Mama speaks Chinese) You often go to Mew's place, which is not so good. People will start to talk. - Ai Ya. - Mama. You don't need to nag her. People know that Mew is a sissy boy. Ahh. Why are you saying this? Mew is not a sissy. He is a real man. You had better watch what you say. Whoo. [It might have been a long time] [It might have been so far away] Very nice. Really nice. We will use this song to promote your next album. Umm June, please take them to practice this evening. Yes. From now on, we will practice at Saw Records. - Reserve it. - Right away. Very nice. Look at this. Why isn't Tang in this picture? She already had gone with her friends? I can't remember. And why don't you put out pictures of her? Because she isn't here anymore. (Aex) Hey Mew. That chord, your A Flat Augmented Seven. How do I play it? Wan is playing keyboard. Just ask him. A Flat C. E. E. G. Isn't that G Flat? Hey. Yeah right, G Flat. G Flat. G Flat. Oh oh. Kinda difficult. Yeah, that's right. That's right. G Flat. I'm asking for A Flat Augmented Seven! Isn't that funny? Do you have an issue with him? No no. Not really. You're both in the same band. Why don't you talk to each other? Don't be angry with each other. It's just something stupid. Umm. They say. People who are angry at each other about silly things... usually are the ones who care about each other so much. - Right? - Right. Right. Ahh. Are you crazy? - Oh it's getting too far now. - Oops. Now. Time's up. Go. Continue practicing. I'll get some snacks. - Do you want anything? - Yes, yes. - Two Gob Gobs. - I want Lays chips. I'll be back. (June) Play well. [phone ringing] Hello, what's up Mew? Are you busy? I have smething to show you. Sure. Where are you? Tong. Where're you going? - Just out for a bit. - Hey. (music) If life didn't have any meaning would you feel like I feel? That the days what we're together. The days we were together - Ah. Tong, come in OK, this will be the last time. We only have a few minutes left. (music) It might have been a long time It might have been so far away That we walked in our own way that day There might be many people. Hundreds or thousands of them Who came into my life and made it go around Or because they are not you And I hadn't found what I had lost Or because that day what I did was wrong and made it impossible for us to go back to that day Do you feel like I feel? That a day without you Life would not have any meaning Do you feel like I feel? That the days we were together. The days we were together. None of those days, were we unhappy June, this is Tong. Tong, this is June. Your friend is so quiet. Do you go to the same school? I am in another school. Oh really? So, how did you get to know each other? When we were kids, we were neighbors. If you don't eat this, I'll take it. (Ahh) This one too. - You don't have anything left? - Ok, I'll give it back. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. Go. Get in the car. Ok, see you later. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye. See you, Tong. Good luck, Mew. Good luck guys... Good luck. Umm. So, do you have to go home now? What time is it? [phone ringing] Tong, do you think June looks like Tang? Looks like her so much that I get goose pimples. - Do you think it's possible that? - It's impossible, Mew. There are many look-alikes. (Tong) So, Mew, how have you been? Fine. Playing my music is fun. But you are alone. Aren't you lonely? Frighteningly lonely. What do you mean? "Frighteningly lonely"? It's like when we were younger. We were so lonely because we didn't have alot friends. And now that we are grown up loneliness seems so much worse. Why is it so bad for you? I don't know how to explain it. It started during the summer when I was in 8th Grade. Papa took grandma somewhere for 3 or 4 days. And the day she came back I heard that when I was away, you were so stubborn. [camera shutter] (Mew) It's not easy at all, because the longer my grandma is gone the more I miss her. So I have one question. If we can love someone so much how will we be able to handle it the one day when we are separated? And, if being separated is a part of life, and you know about separation well, is it possible, Tong that we can love someone and not be afraid of ever losing them? (Mew) At the same time, I was also wondering. Is it possible that, we can live our entire life without loving anyone at all? That's my loneliness. I have lived with it now for 5 years. I know just how bad loneliness feels. I fear it will continue to get worse. Mew. You were sound asleep in my arms, I tried not to wake you. Tong. [phone beeping] Thanks for staying. I hope you got home safely. Mew. (Aod) Aex. Try it again. (Sound Engineer) Ok. Go ahead. Using a computer? Then why are we here? Oh be quiet, it's fine. Enough, enough. Aex. Enough. Hey, stay calm. Start over, ok? (Ying) Joy, I did it, but I got no reaction. If you like him, why don't you just tell him directly? Why believe that sort of book? If you believe in it, you'll never have a boyfriend. - It's nonsense, isn't it? - Ahh. I got it from your house, Joy. Oh, that's mine? Her house doesn't have that book. Are you sure? Hello girls. This is my friend, Tong. - Hello. - Ahh. - Ahh. - Sit down. Sit. Use the microphone. Behind you. Aex, when you played the guitar, did you tune it up? That's ok. Start over. - June, June. - Yes. - Get a pack of Paracetamol Cigs for me. - Ok. You sure one pack is enough? Ying, why don't you eat? She is doing some voodoo stuff. Just leave her alone. Voodoo? What are you doing? Just don't listen to her. I'm on diet. Let me tell you She saw it in a book that if you want someone to love you, you have stick his hair into a Teddy bear. and then don't eat meat for 3 days. So, who do you like, Ying? It's her neighbor, Mew. (Ying) JOY! None of your business. - Let me out. - Where are you going? Wait for me. Where are you going? Hey. I think it's getting weird. I think it's getting weird too. Hey. Hey. Gosh, so who will pay now? - I don't have enough money. - Neither do I. - I don't have enough either. - I don't know. I'm just gonna eat now. What's the matter with you? Ah. ah, your mom is here. Go. (Donut) The other day I was still angry at you. So I didn't want to come. and that's it. Is this one pretty? It's pretty. What about this one? Also pretty. So which one is better? Which one do you like? I don't know. I like both of them. Tong, can you help me choose? I don't know how to choose ear rings. Can you buy one for me? Sure. (Donut) Do you want that, Tong? Excuse me, can you give me a discount on the wooden doll over there? I can't go lower. It's already marked down. Can I buy just a part of it? Are you crazy? How would I sell it like that? What would I do with the rest of it? Tong, why don't you buy the whole thing? Because I bought those earrings for you, so I don't have enough money now. (Donut) Is it that important to you? I've never seen you interested in such toys. It's not for me. Who are you buying it for? For my friend. Friend? Which friend? Is it a girl? it's a guy. For your guy friend, you are willing to buy something so expensive? You are underage. I can't sell it to you. Birthday's only 3 months away. It doesn't matter. It's the law. What do you want? A pack of Green LM, and a pack of Paracetamol Cigs. What's the total? - 56. - How much? (June) Smoking is not good for you. Do you want to see Mew at the Studio? We are having fun. Is it going to be late? Umm. I still don't know. most likely it will. I can't make it then. My mom is on her way to pick me up. Your mom is still picking you up? I better go. June, please say hi to Mew for me. Ok, I'll tell him. [Hiccup] Mom. Umm. Isn't there someone who can help him to get better? Who? Who would be willing to help? (Korn) Aww, Too loud. Be quiet! (Ying) Mom. Wait. What did you say about the job you are doing? I'm responsible for music bands. And the job before this one? Just freelancing. Event organizing for some filming studios. Where are you from? Chiangmai. What about your family? They have all passed away. So, who do you stay with? I live by myself. And. What about this extra job that we are here to talk about? Umm. It may sound a little strange. Dad. (Korn) Where have you been? (June) I'm back, Dad. Who'll lead us prayer? Let Tang do it. But we haven't done it for a long time. It's ok. It's ok. Tang can lead it. [clears throat] - Every dishes of rice- - In the name of- Every dishes of food, we won't waste them They are precious. Farmers are working hard. Not an easy life. Think of the poor. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Is that a new prayer? (Whispers) They are Christian. Ah. Ah. Their prayers are like this, dad. Why don't you tell us what it's like over there? After you got lost in the jungle. What you told me in the car. Ah. It's. After I got hit by the car, right? There are hill tribes. Two of them. And they saved my life. When I woke up they said they saved my life. My memory is not the best. They took good care of me and fed me. They made food for me. At first we couldn't communicate that much. But. Enough to get by. It's fine. Can we please start the meal? (Sunee) Eat before it gets cold. (June) Some fish, dad? Fish is so delicious. It's good for your brain too. Can you handle this? I will be ok. But I can only make it periodically. If he gets up and doesn't see me, is he going to be alright? I don't know either. I don't even know if he will remember this. What's this? Please take it. Thank you very much. - Umm. June? - Huh? How did you come up with so many details for the jungle story? It's from the movie "Ruk Jung". Ruk Jung? Rattapoom and Paula. Ahh. See you later. Bye. [phone ringing] I am so glad we met again or this good thing we have going wouldn't have happened. Tong. Mew, this love song is beautiful. Did you write this love song for someone? Just don't give me any weird chords again. Think of the guitar player too. Do we have this song in our audition? [phone ringing] What's up, Tong? Ahh. So, where are you now? Today? Yes. sure Ok. yeah. ok, I'll see you soon then. Umm. Why did you guys stop playing? Umm. Tang, you're not going to school? I don't go to school anymore, dad. I can't leave you alone like this, dad. How could I? You should take the medicine and drink a lot of water, so I can go back to school again. I'll put the plates away. (June) What is this? (Tong) Ahh. Dad wants to play the treasure hunt game with you. What game? It's a game we played when we were kids. It means there's something he wants to give you, June. Really? Are there any more pieces? Yes, you wrapped your chewing gum and threw out already. Is it going to be ok? Don't worry. Tomorrow he will have forgotten all about this. Really? I better go now. - See you later. - Bye, June. Tong, are you available this Sunday? (Tong) We are having a party for June. Is that really be a good idea? That's what I thought. But our dad wants to do it. Nobody can say no. This means things are getting better at your house, right? Who's that? An old friend. Let me drink just today. Doctor, you drink too? - Tang. How are you? - Umm. I'm Aey, Aui's girlfriend. - Ahh. Hello. - Don't pretend not to remember us. You grew up so much. - Hello. - Hello. Please, make yourself at home. After I stayed with the hill tribes, I moved to Chiangmai. That's why. And didn't you want to come home? I lost my memory. So I couldn't remember the way. It sounds like the "Ruk Jung" movie, doesn't it? It's so similar to that movie. Until June, Ooops, Tang remembered. It was so long ago. - Tang. - Huh? Let's get some ice. Oh, I should get some ice. Please excuse us. Let's don't say too much, It's gonna get out of control. Why? This is fun. If people find out about it, it's not going to be fun anymore. C'mon, don't get too serious. This is a party. Let's go listen to Mew sing. Let me take this. And this is our new song. We have never played it anywhere. It will be the first time at this party. It's about love, so let's listen to it. If I say that I wrote this song for you, Would you believe me? It might not be as well-written or beautiful like other songs] I want you to know that a love song, can't be written if you're not in love but for you, I can write this song so easily You might have heard hundreds or thousands of love songs. They might be meaningful, but their meanings are for anyone. When you listen to this song, it is written only for you. If you understand the meaning, our hearts will be together, forever. Did you know that, Tang is the most enviable girl. Why is that? I don't know. When I grew up, noone ever arranged a party like this for me. - So I just feel that Tang- - It's not- It's not like that. Because when she was with us, we never had something like this for her. Can I ask you something? Do you think Tang is still here or is she gone? (Tong) That song. It's so beautiful. How did you write it? Umm. Without you in my life, there wouldn't be such a song. Do you have anything to say after listening to it? I can show you. What is it? Are you alright? Do you want me to pick you up this evening? It's ok, mom. I'll go home by myself. (Sunee) Mew. Mew, what kind of relationship are you having with Tong? We're just friends. Last night, I saw you and Tong at the party. I understand it now. Listen to me carefully. Mew, you know what my family has had to cope with, right? You know what we have lost, right? Tong is the only one we have left and I don't want to see him taking a path that is not right. What do you mean? In the future, when Tong has graduated, he has to find a job, save money, and look for a good wife, get married and have a happy family where they can take care of each other when they grow old. That is life, Mew. I took care of him so that he grows up that way. Mew, do it for Tong. Stop this relationship that you have with him. It doesn't matter what kind of love you have for Tong. You want to see that he is happy and that he has a good life. Aunty Sunee, we are just friends. One day you will understand. [Tong calling Mew] [Mew's phone ringing] [Tong's phone ringing] Tong. Do you want me to pick you up? (June) I called him, Pingpong, but his phone was off. Is anyone having problems with him? (Pingpong) I don't know. June, can you help us look for him? As soon as I get out of here, I'll look for him. Yes. Yes. Ok. One moment, let me check one moment. (Music Company) So Slow Is he gonna show up? Of course. Of course he will. Is everything alright? Tong. Tong! - Where are you going? - My friend's house. Whose house? Mew's house. I can't let you go. You can't go to Mew's house anymore. Why not? I know about everything, and I have talked to him! You went to see Mew? (June) Do you have any idea what you have done? Do you know? Why wouldn't I know what I've done? You are not me. You are not in our family. So, what would you know? Mew. Mew! Mew. Are you there? Come down please... talk to me. Mew. (neighbor) Aww. Be quiet. Everybody is asleep! (neighbor) Stop yelling, go look elsewhere. Go! (Korn) You are always like this. - Who would put up with it? - What about you? Everyday, constantly drinking. Have you known any of our problems? - Have you ever listened to other people? - Why do I have to! Why do I have to listen to a loser like you? Aww. (friend) Hurry up. - Hey. - Come, come, come. Are you drunk? - Sit, sit, sit. - This is slow. I was waiting for him. (friend) Looks like you've got problems. Cause when you're happy, you don't come to see us, right? It doesn't matter. Just give him one set. Why don't you get them here? Hey. Hey. You two. Your friends are here, come in and drink. Drink. Drink. Let's drink. You'll forget about it soon. Salute! Cheers! I know the truth about what's going on but I still have to find an excuse to tell Aod. Because last night, when you didn't show up, it was a big problem. I was sick. Aod told me to ask you what you want to do. We have already been booked for the Christmas Festival. Will you be able to perform? I'll try. I can so no paths that can lead me forward In darkness with my lonely heart. In darkness without your heart near mine. The night can be so very long. When I can see no light from the sky. The more I look around. The more I become more afraid. Of the night that has yet to pass. Is there any other way to go? Anyway, I can see the sun is going to shine tomorrow. When we are in the new morning, I hope that we will find the way. What have I done? This is what I deserve, isn't it? No matter what I do these days it's still not good enough, is it? When the sorrows of the yesterdays, come crashing on my lonely heart. The reason that I lost our love is because I neglected the needs of my own heart. My suffering became an endless night but it will soon come to pass. As long as time goes by so will my sorrow. Because the thought of our love means there is no endless night. I can so no paths that can lead me forward In the darkness with my lonely heart. The night can be so very long. When I see no light coming from the sky. The more I look around. The more I become more afraid. Of the night that has yet to pass. When we are in the new morning, I hope that we will find the way, Ooh. When we are in the new morning, I hope that we will find the way. What do you want to be when you grow up? I want to be a director. What's this? Yes, yes, we can go. Hey Tong, let me ask you about Donut. Why? Donut is your girlfriend. Why don't you pay attention to her? That's right. Can I ask you straight forward. Just answer, Yes or No. Are you gay? Hey? Some friends saw you walking with a boy from St. Nicholas. Where did you hear that? - From Whae. - Aww. Don't drag me into this but I really heard it, that you were walking with a boy from St. Nicholas at Siam Square. So, are you? You guys, this is such nonsense. - It's you. (So it's true? So, he is gay?) - Ahh. I haven't said anything. - You said he was gay. - Bastard, I haven't said a word. Oh, there she goes again. What about me? You told them about me. No, Tong, I didn't. - I don't know. - Do you want to know so badly? It's not like that, Tong. - You want to know whether I'm gay or not? - It's not like that, Tong. Tong. It's not- What am I, Ying? What has happened to me? (Tong weeping) It's ok, Tong. It's ok. Everyone is upset with me because I don't know what I am. It will get better. Ehh. Why does Tong have a black-eye? A soccer football hit his face Dad, don't you remember that all the time in Chiangmai his eye looked like a panda during the trip? Where were you in this picture? By then, I already went with my friends. I think you asked someone there to take this picture. Dad... dad are you alright? You look completely exhausted. I think you better get some rest. Wait. Where did you get those stories? I made them all up. It's just the story he wanted to hear. June, please tell me who you are? Why? I am June. No. I mean, where are you from? Who are your parents? I've already told you everything. Can you tell me one more time? I want to hear all of it again. Why would you want to know? I hired you, so I have the right to know. I can't just hire a stranger from somewhere and have them stay in my house. I think you got it right I'm just a stranger. Korn? Korn? Korn! (Korn) Where is Tang? Where is Tang? What is this? What has happened to you? Korn! June! June! (Operator)[The number you're calling is not available] Tang, can you call Tong? (Operator)[The number you're calling] (Doctor) When the liver gets in this condition it affects the blood pressure. The blood vessels in his intestines were damaged so he became like this. (Sunee) How serious is his condition? (Doctor) More than 80% of his liver is damaged. At this stage, we just have to hope and pray for the best. (Operator)[The number you're calling] When I decided to come to Bangkok to study, my parents didn't want me to go, because they didn't have much money. But I finally ended up coming here because I thought, if I stayed in Chiangmai my life wouldn't become much better than it already was. But once I got here I didn't contact my parents. I just thought that my life had to improve dramatically before I could return home. I couldn't go back home and disappoint them. Do you know what happened? I had been working steadily and I saved up some money, then I went back home only to discover that my parents weren't there anymore. They had died shortly after I went off to Bangkok. What happened? They say it was an accident. I don't even know what kind of accident. and I don't want to know. I just know that they're gone. I did everything I could just to make them happy without knowing that they were already dead. They died, and I didn't have a chance to make anything better for them, to apologize or to even let them know just how much I loved them. But you are so very lucky. Is that the truth or did you make that up to make me feel better, huh? (June) Is the light too bright for you? (Korn) Where's your mom? What? Where's your mom? She went to get something. Do you want anything, dad? Will I make it and get out of here? Yes. Dad. I have something to tell you. Mom. Where have you been? Tong! Don't you go to school? (June) The doctor prescribed an antitoxin and it has helped a lot. He can go home in a couple of days. Although my presence helps him get better, he never stops drinking. What we have been doing, does it really help to improve things? Dad I have to go back for a while. Bye. (Korn) Tang. Will you come home for Christmas? It might have been a long time It might have been so far away (muffled) That we were waking... Continue. [Chinese song] [From Ying's Place] Mew. What are you doing? Ahh. This song. This song. - This song? - Yes. Do you want to borrow it? No, I only need a little part of it. I just want to memorize it. Umm. Most Chinese songs have good meanings. Ying, what does this part mean? - Where? - Here. I don't know it either, Mew. I'll go ask my brother for you. Ok. Mew. Now I know what it means. And, what does it mean? It means, "As long as you love, you will still have hope." So, Ying, are you still hoping? And should I still hope? Ying, you are a good friend of mine. Why, grandma. Why. So, who will sing? This one. We were thinking of changing the lead singer because nobody has seen your faces before. If he can sing, I'm fine with it. What about the composer of your songs? Let's do this, June. June! Talk to him nicely. - Please, Sit down. - OK. June, you know the problems the August Band is having, right? Yes, I do. And do you know why I hired you? - To take care of August Band. - Right. On everything. It doesn't matter what it is. Now they have a big problem. And where have you been? When I told you to manage the rehearsal, you were gone and then you were late. I don't understand it, June. I think it might be a good idea for you to try something different. Forget something? Korn, eat some food and take your medication. (June) How are you doing? It's about the same. Are you going to come back? I have to go now. Let me give you this. - What is it? - Open it at home. You'll see. Ok, you better go. Your friends are here. Tong. Your family is the best. Please take care of one another. (Aex) Mew, why are you so mad at me? I wasn't angry when you got us into trouble, but I don't understand why you have changed so much. What is it you want? If I am the cause of your anger, I apologize. I'm not angry at you. I just can't sing these songs anymore. Tell me why? I'm not in the mood for singing anymore. You wouldn't understand. Even though I don't understand you, you are still my friend. Why do you always think that no one cares about you? Are you tired, mom? Of what? Of everything. Of course, I'm tired. What can I do? What about you? How's everything? Good I guess, I don't know. It seems fine, mom. Could you turn on the lights? Tong, can you help me put the ornaments on the tree. Is this good here, mom? Just put it around. What about this on here instead, mom? Just put it on. What about the two of these together here? Just go ahead, ok. But what if I choose one and you don't like it? You'll be upset again. Son, you do as you wish. (chooses male figure) [phone beeping] ["Let's go to Christmas Festival together...Donut"] (Ying) I don't know what to tell you Tong. You have to decide. (Ying) Do you want to buy it, Tong? Huh. But I just want the nose. It's too much to buy the whole thing. Umm. Just a moment I'll get it for you. Please. Please. Give me, please. What about the rest of the pieces? I beg of you, please. - Alright. - Thank you so much. - Take it. - Thank you so much. You're very kind. Thank you so much. [phone beeping] ["I'll wait for you at Center Point at 6:30. Donut"] Tong. - Don't come home too late. - Yes, mom. Have you seen June lately? No. Why? Do you think she will come? Mom... There's something in the kitchen cupboard. What is it? Nothing, mom. Nothing. I gotta go. (June)I spoke to Korn and he knows. [phone beeping] ["I'm here waiting. Donut"] Now it's the moment you have all been waiting for. Let me check. Are you ok down there? You are late again. Should we go now? I'm sorry, I have something to tell you. Just tell me when we get there. Hurry up. We are late. Now it's time to see them. The August Band! Hurry up. (Mew singing) If I said that I wrote this song for you would you believe me? It might not be as well-written or beautiful like the other songs. I want you to know that, you can't write a love song, if you're not in Love. But for you, I can write this song so easily. You might have heard hundreds (Tong)Donut, I'm really sorry. - I can't go with you, Donut. Aww. But you said you would. Umm. I meant that we can't see each other anymore. I'm really sorry. Why didn't you tell me earlier, so I could date other people? (Mew singing) If you understand the meaning, our hearts will be together, forever. Let it be the song, on the way along with only your and my voice. That we'll be together for so long Just like a verse in a poem. "As long as you love, you still have hope." Every time I see your love shining in my heart, I see my destiny. (June) I have been thinking. How will you make it from now on? But I believe so much, that you can make it without me. because you have so much love for one another. Even though, sometimes, it seems to be too much that you hurt yourselves. but I believe when the time goes by we would all agree that there is no such thing as "Too much love". (Mew singing) There are so many truths in our love. In the past, I spent a lot of time looking for the meaning of it but I just know that every time you are near I know that if our life is a melody, then you are the lyrics that make my life meaningful and together we make beautiful music. Let it be the song, on the way along with only your and my voice. That we'll be together for all time. Just like a verse in a poem. "As long as you love, you still have hope." Every time I see your love shining in my heart, I see my destiny. (June) Even if it led us into making some mistakes, it's better than never having tried to find love at all. Isn't that right? Life always give us opportunities to start over after we learn from our mistakes. I hope you take the opportunities you have left and take good care of one another. Thank you for everything. If there's a chance, we might see each other again. What is this? It's when we went to Chiangmai together. At that time, she was already gone, right? Not yet. The four of us were there, but Tang wanted to take the photo. Look at you. You smiled so proudly that Tang finally learned how to take a photo. It might have been a tiny thing but it's one of the few occasions when Tang made us proud of her. Korn. Korn. I know. I've always known. Hey. Your friend's here. (Joy) Where have you been? Where's Tong? He's probably home. He's probably gone home. He is Christian, he went home to see Santa Clause. But Santa already came today. Santa comes tomorrow. You are stupid. - Today! - Tomorrow! Hey. What's the matter? (Joy) Hey, what's wrong? - Hey. Are you ok? - Why are you crying? You can talk to us. (Tong) Mew. Hey Tong. The music was great. Do you have anything to say after listening to it? Umm. I can't be with you as your boyfriend. But that doesn't mean that I don't love you, Mew. Thank you. Umm. I have to go. They're waiting. Wait, Mew. Ah, I want to give you this. What is it? It's your Christmas present. Thank you. Umm. I better go. - Good luck. - Good luck. (friends) Hey. What is it? Let me see. (Tong) Did she show up? No. She won't be back again. From now on, there's only us, son. Thank you. To all the Loves that bring us to Life. [If I say that I wrote this song for you, would you believe me?] [It might not be as well-written and beautiful like other songs] [I want you to know that you can't write a love song, if you're not in love] [But for you, I can write this song so easily] [You might have heard hundreds or thousands of love songs] [They might be meaningful, but their meanings are for anyone] [If you listen to this song, that is written only for you] [If you understand the meaning, our hearts will be together] [There are so many truths in love] [In the past, I spent a lot of time looking for the meaning of it] [but I just knew that every time you are near] [I just knew that if life is a melody, you are the lyrics to make it meaningful] [and make life a beautiful music] [Let it be the song.
