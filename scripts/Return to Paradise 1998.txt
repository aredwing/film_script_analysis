Some sleaze was selling frequent-flyer miles, right? 456 00:43:27,858 -- 00:43:32,354 That's not the point. The point is this guy is still over there in Penang. 457 00:43:32,571 -- 00:43:35,987 He's kind of a pal. But anyway, they're gonna hang him. 458 00:43:36,200 -- 00:43:42,202 They found some hashish on him. But some of the hash was mine. 459 00:43:42,414 -- 00:43:44,656 So if I go back there, 460 00:43:44,875 -- 00:43:48,707 I'd have to serve three years in prison, Penang Prison. 461 00:43:48,921 -- 00:43:51,044 But if I don't go back, they hang this guy. 462 00:43:51,256 -- 00:43:54,376 They don't hang guys for hashish. I'm not that naive. 463 00:43:54,593 -- 00:43:56,751 You're leaving something out. 464 00:43:56,970 -- 00:44:01,050 I'm not leaving anything out, Dad. That's the way it is over there. 465 00:44:01,266 -- 00:44:03,971 All right. So maybe you're right and I'm wrong. 466 00:44:04,186 -- 00:44:06,855 You still want my advice in this hanging stuff? 467 00:44:07,064 -- 00:44:09,187 - Yeah. - It feels like an easy call. 468 00:44:11,693 -- 00:44:15,940 If you weren't wasting your life here, it might be different. 469 00:44:16,156 -- 00:44:18,564 But this pal you'll save, 470 00:44:18,784 -- 00:44:21,571 odds are he's worth more than you. 471 00:44:21,787 -- 00:44:25,452 So my advice, you go, you do the time. 472 00:44:27,459 -- 00:44:30,377 What's the matter?

And the other thing I think you've overlooked 559 00:52:18,263 -- 00:52:21,015 is that that building's not up to code. 560 00:52:21,225 -- 00:52:23,597 - Oh, Jesus. - What are you, the class clown? 561 00:52:23,810 -- 00:52:26,811 And who are you to tell them to give up their freedom? 562 00:52:27,022 -- 00:52:29,180 I represent a boy sentenced to death. 563 00:52:29,399 -- 00:52:32,021 Right.

I have not demanded anything. 565 00:52:37,074 -- 00:52:41,368 ...that they endure three or six years of God knows what.

Somebody's got to do something. Please. 572 00:53:12,442 -- 00:53:15,147 Where's the document that guarantees this deal? 573 00:53:17,281 -- 00:53:20,732 The Attorney General of Malaysia has agreed... 574 00:53:20,951 -- 00:53:23,738 So where is it? Why don't we have a copy? 575 00:53:25,038 -- 00:53:27,446 - It's an oral agreement. - No. 576 00:53:27,666 -- 00:53:30,157 Tony goes nowhere till we have that document. 577 00:53:30,377 -- 00:53:32,785 They don't work that way.
