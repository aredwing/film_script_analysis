We have waited for three mornings. We haven't seen any big bird flying above. Dongzi, no more day-dreaming please! Trust me! I did see it! Let's go! The one stay is a fool! I guess he saw a little bird. Wait, that big bird will come soon. Okay, you stay... - We're leaving. - And wait. Bravo! Let's go for fun. Hey, stay! We agree to move and stay together! Yazi, you're my best friend! Only you trust me. Of course I do. But the horned beetle king... Can you give it to me? You fatty! You support me with conditions! The beetle died. Why didn't you tell me earlier? What a waste of time! Mom, let me wipe away your sweat. Good boy! Lead the ox to your father. Follow me! What's up? Dad, the ox is feeling well! Don't worry, give it some fresh grass with guava leaves. It can cure it. Okay. Ox, you must be exhausted! Why everyone has had a tough life? We gain nothing this year. Hurry up! That bastard Hu Han-san doesn't repair the bridge. Yazi, do you dare to come up for fun? Sure! What a luck! Ding gives 150 kilograms of rice. Chang, you must give your rent now. Yes, I know. All heroes are no match for me! I dare to do all kinds of bad deeds! Have a seat, master. Something is wrong with the rent. I am the king of this village! Everything must be under my control! Listen! There wasn't any natural disaster in this year. Why is the crop so bad? Sure someone has hide up some rice. No one can be able to cheat me. I've asked someone to check it out... Investigation is now undertaking! If I get the proofs, not just extra rent will be added on you! You! You hide up the crop too. Confess now. You have taken all our rice. It's not true. - Arrest her. - You've gone too far. Shut up! You lied! All of you shut up! This is Pan Xing-yi's woman. I see! Arrest her. Stop it! What proof do you have? - You've gone too far! - No bullies in the village! My words are evidences. What's that? What's that? It blocks my eye sights. This is for you. Serve him right. Master, are you okay? Take Master back home. Beautiful fireflies! I think Hu Han-san has started to suspect us. Brother Xing-yi, what'd we do now? The rice is for supporting the Red Army's long march. We must help by all means. Freeze! Don't move. Where are you going to? Hurry up! Hide up now. Yes? Don't make a noise. Search! Yes. Do you want to escape? What do you want? Get him! Yes! What are you doing? - Dad. - Beat him up! Beat hardly! This is the result of helping the Red Army. Try if you dare! You love stealing rice? Okay, I'll give you a hand. I will let you take my rice now! We live to achieve better food and better clothes. If one dies, he'll have nothing. This is simple, don't you understand? I don't think you're not afraid of death. - Stop! - Stop! No lynching here! Tell me where the rice is, I'll let him go. Set him free first. Li-hua, don't say a word. So you confess now! Get the woman for me. The Red Army isn't here to help you! It's too early to make a rebel! I tell you! Once I am here in the village, I am the king, everything must be under my control! It's you, little devil! Your family is all under arrest. Let me go! He doesn't even let the kid go! How dare you bite me? Okay, I'll let you watch your dad dying. No! You're a beast! Xing-yi! What's up? Master, the table can't stop bullets! So, you cover me. Are you kidding? I stay behind you, you cover me, shoot him! Trash, move! Kill him for me. - Dad, are you okay? - Got you! The Red Army comes to save us. Go after him! Get him for me. - Got you! - Don't let him escape! Get him! Follow him! Surrender now! This belongs to the villagers. Come and share it! Bravo! - It's great! - So much rice here! Bravo! I've never seen this much! From now on, we won't suffer from hunger! If you need help, just come to us. Officer, the boar in our village has not mated yet. Kids always get sick, but we have no doctor here. Okay, Shui, you start up a clinic here. Sure, captain! I'd like the Red Army to do us a flavor. Yes, Mrs. Pan? I hope the kids can go to school. This is Mr. Song, he came here especially for education. This top is so pretty. Do you want a try? Let me teach you. I don't think I need you to teach me for playing top. My dad bought this from the town. It's bought from the town! Oh, it's special! I must have a try! Let me teach you, okay? I... I just missed it. Stay back, I'm afraid I'll hurt you. Where is the top? Where is it? Dongzi, it's time to go home for dinner. Got you! Don't worry, I'll get it back for you. Hi, Dongzi, I am Xiao-lan. - Bravo! - We have a school for the kids now. It's great! Dongzi, you are wearing straw sandals! You are wearing new clothes too. We bathed before going to school. Schooling must be funny! What do a teacher look like? He is civilized, so he must be old. The slowest one is a stupid old ox! Don't block my way... Hurry up! Hurry up! - So funny! - Wait for me! This old man should be the teacher! Good morning. I am your teacher, my name is Song Xiao-lan. Teacher? How old are you? My grandpa is teaching the senior class, I'll teach this junior class. Now, you'll get your book first. Dongzi, please help me. Each will get one book, you'd keep it well. Wow, she can write! This is the name of the village you're living. Learn these words first, then I'll teach you how to write your names. After learning how to write your names, I'll teach you how to write your parents' names. Dongzi, let's go catch the horned beetles. Dongzi, come out to write your name please. What a big horned beetle! You spell it wrong! I swear I'd get you! You should always remember that it's hard to get this learning chance. Pay attention in class, no mischief, okay? Yes, sir. Okay, it's time to go now. Bravo! Xiao-lan, you can go with them to have some fun! Wait for me! Miss Song? It's not school time, just call me Xiao-lan. Xiao-lan? I'd like to play with you all. But we'd never tell strangers where our base is. He means the place we have fun. Base? What's up? Miss... No... Xiao-lan, can you keep secret? Sure. We agree that if you can catch us up, we'll let you play with us. Dongzi, are you going or not? Wait for me! Wait for me! I swear I can catch you up! Hurry up! Xiao-lan, you'd better go back! Hopeless! You can go back by walking straight to that direction. Where is Miss Song? I bet she's back. Who said so? Oh, you made it! Did Dongzi bring you here? Hey, mind your tongue! You agreed that if I could catch you up, you'll let me play with you, right? If you climb up to the tree top, we'll let you play with us. Are you despising me? She is climbing! Xiao-lan, charge up! Xiao-lan, charge up! - Charge up! - Xiao-lan, charge up! She dares to climb up! Come on. Let me help you! - Xiao-lan is great! - She made it! This is beautiful! This is the place we grow up. Let me show you around. I got it! Where is it? I got it. Have you got it? What's that? Hey, attention please! My sisterjust shitted, it is floating towards you guys! Let's go. What's that? It's so pretty! This is soap! It's for washing. See the bubbles! Look! My dad had a factory for producing soap. Let me save it. - Dongzi... - Be careful! Dongzi, be careful! It's dangerous! Dad, look, it's a nice dog. Do you want to adopt it? But I don't think mom would say yes. Okay, let me fix it. You want to have that dog, or Dongzi wants to have that dog? Remember? He had some chickens as pets some years ago, He didn't take good care of them, finally they were all eaten by wolves. That's an accident. It'll never happen again. How do you know it? I think you are well planned. Look, this is your favourite azalea. Dongzi and you always choke me up! Done! Bravo! Mom, you're so pretty! Dad, let's name the doggie. Just call him Strong, we hope it'd grow stronger and stronger. Okay, I'll act as Xiu-zhu, I beat crimes! So, who is going to act as Hu Han-san? The fattest among us would play Hu Han-san. So you want me to act as Hu? No way! Sure you'd act as Hu, I aim as sharp as Uncle Xiu-zhu. I want to act as Uncle Xiu-zhu. I guess a competition would decide everything. The loser would act as Hu Han-san. Xiao-lan, you'll be the judge. Each of you can shoot twice. The first one to break the jar is the winner. First round, Yazi first. He looks stupid! Let me show you something! Bingo! I won! But the jar isn't broken! - Oh no! - Second round, Dongzi shoot first. - He missed it. - He lost it. Why do you laugh? - Bingo! - Yazi got it! Bravo, Yazi is a great sniper! It's not fair! I hit the stand, the size is even smaller than the jar. The result is, Yazi won, Dongzi lost. Got it? - Don't move! - I won't act as Hu Han-san! - Stay where you are! - Stop! Dongzi, be righteous! You must admit your failure. Dongzi, you lost, you must act as Hu Han-san. We've got him. Dongzi acts as Hu Han-san, let me add some beard for you. He looks cute! - Dongzi looks just like Hu Han-san! - Serve you right! - You're disgusting! - Shoot him... Shoot him! Dongzi... If we know how to make use of the Lever Principle, we can move big objects with a little force. It'd benefit our lives so much. Sir, I would like to piss. There is no "Thunder Bird" in this world, please wake up. You're wrong, I did see it! But no one trusts you! That is "Thunder Bird"! It appears! Why just only I see you? Not any people trust me at all. I trust you! I saw it too. That's a "Thunder Bird". You saw it? Finally someone sees it too. Actually that's a plane, it's made by iron and steel. It can take people to the sky. People can fly? How do you know that? My parents took me on the plane too. But how can iron and steel fly in the air? I don't know. Anyway, it can fly. But you're a teacher, why don't you know that? Mom! Why did you truant? Mom... what was taught in class, I already knew it. You lied! What did you learn from school? I... I know how to write my name. And I know how to write my parents' names. Okay, write it now. This is your name, mom! Zeng Li-hua. Is that true? Is... is that my name? Even you learnt it, you can't run away from school. Dongzi has stood for a long time! - You are spoiling him. - Make it an end, okay? Have you eaten yet? Come eat with us, okay? I've already eaten. Any order? Yes. The troop will set out tomorrow. We'll gather in Shan-cheng and move westward. But my squad will stay behind to protect the villagers. I've got to leave to inform other members. See you then. Okay, I'll walk you out. Dongzi, be a man! You must learn to be tough. Good boy! Dongzi, don't choke up. Dad, people can fly, don't you believe it? Is that true? Dad, lie down first, let me show you. Come on. Dad, the "Thunder Bird" flies like this. People can sit inside. Is that true? So, does it land like this? Sit tight! Dongzi, when dad is not home, you're the only man at home, you must take care of your mom. Dad, where are you going to? For the future of our beloved country, and for your future too, I joined the Red Army. I must help to carry out a purge of bad guys like Hu Han-san. But we did catch Hu Han-san, didn't we? There are many bad guys like Hu Han-san in this world. I would be afraid if you are not home. Don't be afraid, I've got this for you. It's so pretty! Dongzi, I wear this red star to fight bravely in all battles. Now, I give it to you, whenever you see it, it means seeing me. I heard that you have to walk a long road. Take these straw sandals. Those are for the other soldiers. Li-hua, thank you. You must take good care. For this family, just leave it to me. Don't worry. Dongzi is growing up. He is more and more rebellious. Just be patient. Dongzi knows how to write his name and ours too. What a smart boy! Okay, let's go to sleep. Dongzi, remember my words? Xing-yi... Escort Hu Han-san to town for his trial. I'll be back! Be careful! Dear friends, see you! See you! - Bye! - Dad, take care! Mom, when can we see dad again? When the azaleas are in full bloom in the mountain, our family will be united again. Be careful! Send someone to check it out. There is an ambush! Set him free if you want to live! Stop dreaming! At worst, let's perish together! I wanna kill you! Today, the Children Brigade of Liu-xi Village is found. Representing the village, you all have my congratulations. Bravo! We have already repaired the bridge. But one piece of wood is missing. I want you to place the last piece. Yes. For this mission, this is a co-operation training. You're divided into two teams. Go up to the mountain and transport the chosen trunk back. The first one here will be the winner. - Give it to me. - The winner will wear... - Give it to me. - The arm-band from Xiao-lan. Here we are. Let me do it. It saves energy. Dongzi, let's copy Yazi to push it. It's okay. Come up now. Come up! Okay, I'll move faster alone. Watch my dust! Bravo! I am the champion! I won! I won! I am great! - It's fixed! - Bravo! - Well done. - Bravo! So it brings convenience for us to cross the river. It's fixed. Bravo! - Be careful! - It's done at last. Shoot him! Run! Captain, how are you? I am fine! Da-shan! Mrs. Pan, run! So, we'll wait for you in the brick kiln. Run! Oh no! Hurry up! Retreat! Mom, are you okay? Let me help you! Where are they? Where have they gone? Captain! Be careful! How is the team? Captain, Da-shan sacrificed. Most of us are hurt. But we don't have enough medicine now. Well, since they haven't got stable yet, I'll go back to fetch some medicines. No, Shui, you must take care of them. Let me go and get it. Mrs. Pan... It's okay. Don't worry. - Lizi, you go with her. - Yes. All right, let's go. You take the medicine back. I must go home to fetch something. Isn't that important? Our situation is critical. Where is it? I got it. This is the hut of Pan Xing-yi. Fire! Fire! How dare you go against me? Your hut is gone now! What a hut! I said, I'll be back! Our home! Lizi, Mrs. Pan is not back yet, you'd better stay with Dongzi. All right. Captain. Dongzi, don't worry. Mom... Where have you been? Mom, are you okay? Dongzi... The school bag? Dear friends, I am back! What you took from me, return it now. And for the food you took from me, return it now! I tell you, Pan Xing-yi's hut... was just burnt by me! I tell you, if you dare hide them up, you'll know every well about the outcome. According to Song's information, that must be a telegraph. This will endanger the Red Army. We must check what conspiracy is going on. Well, leave this matter to me. Dongzi, your mom worries much about your safety, so she asked grandpa to take you away with us. Xing-yi, teach me what to do please. I can't leave them alone, but Dongzi... Maser, is this thing a telegraph? That's right, I can contact the buyer with this device. If this helps to reach a big deal, I'll be rich for the rest of my life. So, I will be rich too! None of your business! The goods are on their way. I think the goods mean armaments. If they trade armaments, it'd become a great threat for the Red Army. So, what'd we do now? We must cut their communication with the outside world. Aim sharp, be concentrate. Eye sight, bullet, target go as a straight line. Breathe in and then hold your breath. Shoot! I made it! Dongzi, you're so smart! But do you know why... Why could Red Army win consecutively? It's because they've got great soldiers. The secret is, we share a same will. We want to build a world of equality. So we unite and fight. Remember the founding date of the Children Brigade? Although you won, your partners didn't feel happy. Have you cared the feeling of your teammates? Dongzi, remember, personal strength is limited. Unity is strength. Let me do it. I am back! I am rich! Right here! Pan Dongzi, you're bold! Why do you love biting? Give me the key. Throw up everything you ate from my kitchen! That's a piece of soap! I can't go out with this! That's Xiao-lan's top! Dongzi, where have you been? It is Hu's telegraph! How can you get this? Mom, did I do it wrong? My son grows up now! You're as brave as your dad. You can take care of mom now. But since you're still young, for something, You'd not do something at this young age, got it? Mom, dad gave me courage Where is dad now? Li... Li, let's make a dash! The Red Army sent that kiddy here. That kiddy took my telegraph! I want you to get it back! Brother, get everyone ready. Do you know where they are? See this broken piece? It's from the brick kiln. Captain! Something's wrong! Wake everyone up. Leave from the chimney. Chiu-cheng. We must use the grenades to sally out. Let me go for it. How lucky I am! Go! I want them alive! Dongzi, follow me! Dongzi, jump! Hurry up! Dongzi, don't panic. Mom is here to protect you! Don't worry! Jump! Dongzi! Dongzi, hide up, I am going to help the soldiers. That's a grenade. Don't worry, the thread is not pulled out yet. That is the woman of Pan Xing-yi! Pull the thread? Mom... Dongzi! Li-hua? Dongzi! Dongzi! Mom! You're awake! Dongzi wakes up now... Grandpa, Dongzi is awake. That's great! Don't worry, Dongzi, this is a safe place. Dongzi, you've slept for 3 days. Xiao-lan, where is my mom? Your mom will never come back. You must be tough! Dongzi! Xiao-lan, take care of him. Mom... Mom, where are you? Mom... Mom... Dongzi will behave! Dongzi will study hard! Mom! Mom, don't go! Mom! Mom, come back please! Dongzi, don't feel upset. Be tough! I can never see my mom! You don't understand at all! She died! She died! That's my top! My parents sent me that top on my 5th birthday. They're so nice. But they passed away already. I would be afraid if you are not home. Don't be afraid, I've got this for you. It's so pretty! Dongzi, I wear this red star to fight bravely in all battles. Now, I give it to you, whenever you see it, it means seeing me. Xiu-zhu and his fellows are in the cave, even Hu makes a search, it's not easy to locate them. But they're surrounded, many of them got hurt, they have got no salt with them, I am afraid they'd feel weak if not eating some salt. Now I act as Hu's fellow, I'll question you kiddies. Why do you want to leave the village? We go up to the mountain to get some herbs. What for? To cure my pig. Why is it sick? It suffers from diarrhea. What herbs do you want to pick? Are you asking me? I want to pick... What's up with you? That's guava leaves. Guava leaves. I promise I'll remember the answer later. Don't worry, I'll help you. Stay where you are! It stinks! Why do you want to go up to the mountain? We want to get some herbs. What for? To cure... I am not asking you! You, answer. Are you asking me? Yes. I want to cure... my pig. No matter you stink! What's wrong with your pig? It suffers from diarrhea. I am asking you, what herbs do you want to pick? Why asking me again? I want to pick... Guava leaves. Kiddy, what is inside? What is inside? That's my urine. Dad said, soak the leaves inside, so we can make it fresh! Kid's urine is nutritious! Kid, how dare you make me drink your urine? Forget it, they are only kids! Let them go! Dongzi is smart enough to figure it out. He melted the salt into water, then absorb it with the clothes. I just can't figure such idea out. You just can't even remember how sick the pig is! Look! He is the leader of the gang. He blocks the way up. We'll draw their attention away, and you take the chance to move up. So, be careful! Kiddy, where are you going to? I want to pick herbs on the mountain. What's your name? Where do you live? My name is Guo, I live down the valley. My family runs a hoggery. You raise pigs? Someone are found over there. Buddy, let's get those kiddies here. Yes. Uncle, can I go up now? Okay, go! Strong, here you are! What's up? Strong, shut up! It's fine! Let's go. Kid, how dare you fool me? No matter what, we must get him! Dongzi, run! Uncle... Dongzi, hide up now! Shui, are you okay? Don't worry, I am fine. Aim sharp, lock up the target, hold the breath, aim sharp... Uncle Shui, are you okay? I heard shooting around, I want you to search every inch of here. Yes, sir. Oh no, Hu Han-san and his guys are after us. Uncle, get the salt from the clothes, take it. Dongzi, where are you going? Over there! Kiddy, where else can you go? Kiddy, you have no way out now! Finally, I got you! Dongzi is so smart. He absorb the salted water with the clothes. Those who hide up in the mountain, listen to me. You stole my telegraph, I want you to send it back early next morning. I got Pan Dongzi, don't you want to save him? Captain, this is a trap. Dongzi's mom sacrificed for us. We must save Dongzi out. But if we return the telegraph, it'd endanger the Red Army. No sniper can save the kid. If the rope breaks, Pan Dongzi will fall to death. If anyone wants to save him, I'll cut the rope and let him fall. Stay back! - Yazi? - Over here. Yazi, don't hurt Dongzi. Okay, I will be very careful. Finally you've come. Let the kid go! Go over there and have a check! Yes. Master, the key part is missing. Let him go, then I'll return it to you. Let him go? You've got no bargaining power. Cut the crap, let the kid down, then you can take it back. Master... Be careful! Master, someone set fire at the barn. Damn it! They want to burn my armaments? Burn that kiddy to death! Kill them all! Dongzi, grab the rope and jump to the roof. Grab the rope and jump. Dongzi, jump down, don't panic. Dongzi, don't worry, mom is here with you. Jump! Come on! Hurry up. Dongzi, jump! Mom! Get him! You've no where to go! I wanna kill you! Beat him! - Don't beat me! - Break his legs! - Are you okay? - How about you? Sure I can get you! Kid, where do you want to go? Oh my armaments! Kid, you have no where to go! I'll let you regret! Let me try! I quit! Help... Help! Hu Han-san, you deserve it. - Dongzi... - You're fine! Dongzi, you're fine! Bravo! Everyone is fine! Uncle Xiu-zhu. Are you all right? I am fine! Dongzi, the azaleas are in full bloom in the mountain! Dongzi, the azaleas are in full bloom in the mountain Mom, I hope you to bless dad to come home safe. Dongzi, dad is back! Dad! Dad! - Dongzi! - Dad!
