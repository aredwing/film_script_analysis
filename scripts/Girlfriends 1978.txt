You can't take pictures of me asleep if I'm awake, right? Did you dream again? Huh? Did you have a bad dream? Hey, suze... Could you listen to something for a minute? Now? I'm not sure I really like it. Anne, I'm going to work in five minutes. I know, but it's important. Please. OK, go ahead. "I have a war with my mother. "She's on her side. "It has become clear that I'm on mine. "I am pale beside her. "Her hair is black, mine blonde. "Her skin is red, mine off-white. "She looks like a gypsy, and she has a secret sword. "This war could be the longest war in history, "maybe longer than 100 hundred years. "With that in mind, I am polite. "I do not fight this war. "My strategy is disengagement. I will colonize Venus. " Did you ever fight with your mother? No. Did your parents ever argue? Never. Were you surprised when they got divorced? Not really. They never talked to each other either. You don't like it. What don't you like about it? I don't know... Something. I don't know. I like what you did with the last one better. Anne, I got to go. I'm going to be late. OK. Listen, we'll talk about it later, all right? OK. Goodbye. I mean it. We will. OK. Could we have the prayer book, please? OK. Rabbi, why don't you try shaking hands? Why don't you smile, Jeffrey? Um... Jeffrey, what's green and flies over Poland? Peter Panski. OK, great. Thank you so much, rabbi. My pleasure, Mrs. Hinkleman. Thank the rabbi, Jeffrey. Thank you. You did very well, Jeffrey. We've got a wedding we've got to go to next week on Long Island. Yeah? I can't wait. What's a wrench? What? What's a wrench? A wrench? I don't know. It's a place where Jewish cowboys go. Bye. Bye. We'll paint the walls green. No, red. Red? Oh, yeah. It'll be fabulous. Trust me. OK. You sure? Oh, yeah. It'll be great. Oh, boy, we can get a hammock. I could use this as my darkroom. Or it could be another bedroom. Do you think we should have an opening? We can invite Herbie Hancock. You think he'll come? Oh, Suze, I really want you to meet Martin. Oh, he can come. We'll invite him, too. Susan, I really like him. I think I almost might love him. Wait a minute. You think... You almost... Might... love him? I love him. That's fantastic! That's fantastic! What? Would you please not read over my shoulder? You started something. That frigging idiot! I'll take his frigging thesis and throw it down the toilet! Annie, what happened? Tell me. Come on! He can take his goddamn family and live with them for the rest of his life, that animal. OK., so tell me. What's so blind about him? Well, for one thing, he thinks I'm a dilettante. Well, maybe he's not so blind. I can see you really take me seriously. I take you more seriously than you take yourself. How can I love him? Maybe I don't love him. How can you love someone that doesn't even know you? Maybe I just like him a lot. Maybe that's enough. It doesn't sound like much to me. Anyway... Anyway what? You can take care of yourself. I don't want to take care of myself. I want Martin to take care of me. For Christ's sake, Anne, you don't need anyone to take care of you. Don't you know that? I don't? No, you don't. I don't. Anne, you won't believe it. You're going to be famous, and I'm going to be famous. Tell me. What happened? I dit it. They're taking three of my pictures. Three pictures. And one of them is of you. Oh, Susan, that's fantastic. Which ones? One of the kids, the one of David's feet, and one of the morning ones of you. But I'm half naked. You're not naked. Anne, they loved the lighting. That was their favorite. I'm going to get paid! Isn't that incredible? No more bar mitzvahs. I'm so excited. It's fantastic. No more weddings. One more wedding? Never, never. I'll never do another wedding again. Annie, I can't believe it. They loved them. My wedding? What do you mean? You're not getting married. I'm getting married. What? Martin and I are. Annie... That's great. Susan... How can you get married? I mean, you don't even know him. Are you sure? I'm sure. How can you be sure when you're so unsure? I don't know... But I am. Give her some champagne. To the bride and groom. Susan, we need you in the pictures. Come on, Susan, I want you in the picture. Just a minute. Well, you know, I've been thinking for days about what I was going to say. And I just find myself standing here, and I'm so damn happy. I don't really know what to say, except I would like to drink to Anne and just say I feel terrific about it, and I hope you have a fabulous life and a fabulous marriage. I'm gonna throw the bouquet. Hey, Sue! Susan Weinblatt. Hi. - Long time no hear, see, or speak, huh? - Yeah. Are you by yourself this time? Not for long. Red or white? Uh, red. Do you have any ice? Uno momento. Thank you. Where's Jack? He's probably seducing someone in the bathroom. So how was the wedding? Not bad for my third. Congratulations. No, not hers. It was her roommate's. Oh, sorry. That's all right. I caught the bouquet. Oh, congratulations. Then I dropped it. Don't tell your mother. Eric James Allen, Susan Weinblatt. Hi. Pleased to meet you. Terry, can you come over here for a second? - Listen, I'll see you guys later. - OK. So... uh... would, uh, would you like to, uh... Dance? No. So, uh, you're of Chinese ancestry, huh? Wrong. Japanese. That's what I meant, Japanese. Oh. North, right? Northern Japan? No. South. No. North. Yes. Yes. That's what I meant. Susan, how you doing? Denise, all right. How you doing? How was the wedding? Oh, it was great. Listen, you want to dance? - Sure. - OK. Bye. I'll talk to you later. See you, Liz, Bill. What's your middle name? Do you live nearby? Yeah, just a couple of blocks away. You want to go? Actually, I was going to wait around a little bit and talk to a couple of people. Oh, sure. You live near here? No. Up on the East Side, huh? West Side. I live near here, just a couple of blocks away. Oh? You want to go? Did I do something? I just want to go home, that's all. Seriously? Bye. Bye. Boy, oh, boy. Supposed to be women's liberation. Bet you's one of them karate experts, too, huh? Nope. I say it's great. Let them have it. It's about time women got treated like first-class citizens. Ever have the mumps? Ask your boyfriend if he ever had the mumps when he was a kid. When a man, uh, as an adult man, like my age, gets the mumps... He gets impotent. Oh. Thanks for telling me. Bet that would make you mad, huh? I mean, being your boyfriend and all. It's so beautiful. This is a mountain in Safi, I think. No, maybe it's in Casablanca. No, this is Casablanca. No, honey, that was Rabat. Remember? No, Rabat was where we had the picnic. No, we had the picnic in Agadir. Oh... right. Right. Whoops. I guess we forgot to... So, what did you buy? Oh, wait a minute. I'll show you. Martin, show the rest of these to Susan. We'll wait for you, honey. I'll be back in a minute. OK. Coffee? Yes, please. - It's Moroccan. - Oh. - Sugar? - No, thank you. Cream? Do you have any milk? Uh... no. I'm sorry. That's all right. I'll just have it black, then. OK. Thank you. I just want to show these to Susan. Here, honey. Whoa! Careful. Wouldn't kill her on her first day here. Now, this... This is very old. It's beautiful, isn't it? I love it. Oh, I think that's exquisite. What's it made of? It's pure ivory. Beautiful. It's beautiful, isn't it? Lovely. And this is for you. Oh, Annie. Oh, God. I told you we should have got the other one. I think we could have it altered or something. Don't worry. When we go to Italy, we're writing down everybody's sizes. Did you try some coffee? It's Moroccan. Yes. I like it. Where's the bathroom? - The second door on the left. - Thank you. We find acting out genuinely satisfying. We do, do we? Contestant number one, what kind of movie would you like to take a girl to on your first date? Probably a John Ford western because I identify with John Wayne. Take your glasses off for me, OK? But I can't see. That's all right. I can. Trust me. You have a great face. I don't know why you're hiding it. What do you think of this? Your face isn't shaped like hers. It wouldn't work on you. Will anything? Let me see. May I help you? Yes. I dropped off some pictures last week. I'm here to see the photo editor. What's your name? Weinblatt, Susan. Here you go. Can I see her now? No. I'm sorry. She's busy. She'll get in touch with you if she wants anything. Julie... didn't you used to go... Yes. Hi. How are you? Great. Great. So you stuck with it, I see. Yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to. You, too, huh? I got too much work. If I lived here, I wouldn't have time for anything else. Oh, where you living? Vermont. You come down for work? Mm-hmm. How's Neil? Wonderful. You know, I sold three pictures a few months ago. Great. What are you working on now? I have a few things cooking. Actually, I have nothing cooking... At all. Well, what about those people you sold the pictures to? You been back there? No. What are you waiting for? Nothing. Susan, you've got to stay on top of these people. They love to feel they're being pursued by hundreds of young, energetic women. Get it? Yeah, I see. Living alone definitely has its advantages. Yeah? What? Eating when you want, coming home when you want, doing what you want when you get there. I love it. What about Neil? He's fine. We both are. We split. Oh, I'm sorry. It was the best thing for us. Susan, I've got a meeting. I've got to go. Listen, Julie, do you think you might... you might need an assistant sometime? Yeah, I might. Sure. See? You're catching on. Keep in touch. Susan! Susan, uh, uh, uh, uh... Weinblatt. Hey, come on in. Sit down. How have you been, Susan? Great. Have you seen the proofs of the magazine? No. Shelly, would you bring in the proofs of the new issue? Wait till you see it. Your work is good, Susan. Very good. Thanks. I'd just like to show you some of my more recent... You got to work closer. That's the problem. You got to walk right up to people with your camera. You got to take that lens and get it right in their faces. That close? That close. Well, anyway, here are some pictures... You know, talent is... thank you. Now, where the hell are they? Let's see. Oh, yeah. Here we go. Thank you. This one's cropped. Huh? This one's cropped. Oh, yeah. I felt that the blonde in the bed needed reframing. See what I mean? That little bit makes all the difference. Yeah. Well, um... We don't really need anything right now, but I'll call you when we do. Fine. Yes, Mrs. Berman, I'd be very happy to marry you and Mr. Berman again. Don't be silly. Look, why don't I turn you over to Callie and let her arrange a date for us? Callie, will you set up another day for the Bermans again? Yes, yes. Again. Ah. Your move. The Bermans are still at it? Hmm. That's true love for you. Or true boredom. My favorite cynic. You know, I must've seen about 50 people in the last 3 days. "Yes, your work is good, very good, "but we're just not needing anything right now. "Why not try Ms. magazine? You have a very good eye, young lady. " Young lady, young lady! You know, I'm gonna be old before I get to do what I want, then I'll have forgotten what it was. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Have you forgotten that you just had three pictures accepted? Two. Two. One of them was cropped. What? It was cropped, changed. It's not mine anymore. So what did you do about that? Nothing. I'm too chickenshit. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Jesus. Jesus? Have a nice weekend, Callie. Oh, you, too, darlin'. You have a photographer for the Bermans if you want one. You? Yeah, me. Unless you want to pay my coned bill. My rent. Buy me a new lens. A house in the country. Fresh shrimp every night. A trip to South America. Hi, Ter. How you doing? Listen, you want to go to a 10:00 movie tonight? Oh. All right. Well, have a good time. Yeah. Give me a call later. Love to Jack. Bye. Hello. This is the recorded voice of S. Weinblatt. Uh, "S" stands for Salome. And today's fruit is the plum. Bye. Yeah. I... I need a break. Oh, did I tell you? I'm doing a four-page spread for Vogue. Over on the... West Side... Where they're tearing it down and it looks like... like some holocaust has ripped apart the city. Lots of gray and brown, I think. At dawn. Park. I hate it. I hate it! Dear aunt Cheryl... Thank you... For the... hideous... Buddha... which we will... bury. Let's stop smoking. OK. Think we can do it? Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. When shall we start? Uh... Now. Now? Yeah. OK. - Good luck. - Yeah. Same to you, honey. - Let's go to the movies. - We have to finish, Annie. We are very late. I think I'll invite Susan up for the weekend. OK. She's probably busy, though. Yeah, probably. It's really late. I'll try her anyway. OK. What are you doing? I don't think your friend likes me very much. Martin, don't be ridiculous. You're being ridiculous. I am? I hate to bother you, but my car has broken down. I need a jack. Hey... Si, signorina? Do you have any more of those Moroccan cigarettes? No. We quit. Oh. Well, mazel tov. You need any help? No. Grazie. Grazie. Annie says that you are a great cook. Hey, Suze! Was the bed OK? Perfecto. Scusi, inamorata. Excuse me. Ahh. Oh, no... Mangia! It smells wonderful. Bless you, my son. Grazie. Can I get you something? Oh, that's going to be very flattering. Why don't you get my right profile? I think he's allergic to Italian. No. I'm not allergic to anything. Oh, come on, Martin. We all know allergies are psychosomatic. Amputate! Oh, maga, maga! Witch! You better watch out, Annie, you're the helpless blonde. I'm not a helpless blonde. You stopped sneezing. No, I never sneeze while attacking beautiful, helpless women. - I am not a helpless woman! - Bullshit! Whoa, big fella! Whoo you! Hey. I didn't know you could play the piano. Don't stop. I'm going back to school, Suze. I started writing. You did? But I'm feeling a little isolated. Well, what are they going to teach you? Well, I just think it'll help to be around people who are writing. What do you think? Well, what do you think? I think I need the feedback. Then it's OK. I don't know what's best for you, Annie. So how's the new place? OK. What's it like living alone,Suze? I like it. Thanks. You live in New York? No. Well, where you going? Colorado. Oh. Are you hitching? Probably. By yourself? Aren't you afraid? You ask a lot of questions. It's just that I haven't spoken to anybody for three days. Sometimes I talk so much... I don't even know what I'm saying. I didn't want to say anything I didn't mean, so I stopped talking. Is this your car? It's my parents'. Do you live in New York? Student? You work? Yeah. What do you do? I'm a photographer. The guy I just left was a photographer. Well, nothing's permanent, I guess. Except maybe pictures, huh? Morning. Oh, I hope you don't mind. I moved some of your boxes to make room for myself. Are you a dancer? Sort of. Is Ceil your real name? Cecelia. I don't mind you watching. What are you doing? Warming up. I'm going to a workshop this afternoon. You want to come? Oh, I can't dance. You don't have to be a dancer. There'll be lots of interesting people there. I've got to look for a job. Come on. This is good for your body. What's good for your body is good for your mind. It'll help you get a job. No, it'll help me avoid looking for a job. OK. I don't know. Come on. OK. Outta sight. This place is great. You don't get electricity? No. Not this month. Are you broke? In a manner of speaking. Desperately. It's a lot of space for one person. Yeah. I was living with a woman who I was going to share it with. A chopped liver Torah? Last time it was the star of David. Did I ever tell you my grandparents were orthodox? No. My grandfather loved lady wrestlers. He used to watch them on TV Friday nights after everybody else had left. One morning, I got up, I went downstairs... I saw him praying behind these glass doors between the living room and the dining room. He was... Wrapping his tefillin and davening. All of a sudden, I realized that he was talking to God. I wanted to talk to God, too. I mean, it looked like God was right there with him. So I... Started to open the door. Slowly... But he saw me. And he said, very quietly, he said, "get out. " So... I decided that if he wasn't going to let me talk to God, I'd just have to talk to God myself. So, when I was 7... When I was 7, I decided... To become a rabbi. You would've made a great rabbi. Thank you. Did you want to be a rabbi when you were a kid? Actually, I wanted to become an actor. What happened? Well, my parents didn't want me to. They wanted me to become a rabbi. They said there was no future in acting. Well, you really are an actor. I mean, sort of. Sort of. This is what I like about being a rabbi. It's wonderful. Better than talking with God? I don't know yet. Is he here? Always. Well... God- - this is my chance, right? God, do you think that you could teach me to tango? For better... Or for worse. In sickness... And in health. Who's this? Oh, that? That's Marcel Marceau. Did you ever see him? No. When can I see you again? I have to bring in the Bermans' contact sheets. Oh, the Bermans! Can we have lunch Sunday? Is that OK? That would be wonderful. I'm free all afternoon. Susan? It is I. Hey, someone called today about a job. For you. For me? You mean that I, princess of plums, purveyor of all that does not require a can opener, have lucked out? Yup. L'Chaim! Ceil, do you know that I tangoed tonight? Whoo! It was incredible. I don't think I'm as uncoordinated as I thought. Ceil? You know that woman I told you I lived with? Well, she was my roommate, not my lover. Ceil... No. Don't? Good night. Good night. Aren't you going to unpack, Suze? Oh, yeah. Eventually. Where've you been? I've been calling you for days. It's been really crazy around here lately, Annie. Are you becoming religious? Oh, no. That's Ceil's. Who? She's a dancer, on her way to Colorado. Ah, she's the one that answered the phone. I thought you liked living alone. Well, she's interesting. I like her. Anyway, she really needed a place to stay. You do her laundry, too? Oh, uh, she's a little irresponsible. What are you doing? I'm getting in touch with my body. You're in a good mood today. How come you're in such a good mood? Exercise. Do I know him? We have a, uh, professional relationship at the moment. Bordering on mad passion. Bordering on mad passion, yes. Hallelujah! Is he cute? Oh, I wouldn't say he's cute. He's very attractive. How old is he? He's, uh... Slightly older than me. 30? Slightly older. 40-ish? - 50-ish. - 50-ish? Susan, he's married. Hi. - Oh, hi. - Ceil, um... This is Anne. Hi. Hello. I got great fabric in a thrift shop... I thought it'll make beautiful curtains. Oh, that's nice. Suze, don't you think you're getting into something you really don't want to get into? I'm not into anything yet. - I'm just having lunch with him tomorrow. - Lunch. And maybe a little dessert, too. - Suze, married men stay married. - Annie, come on, give me a break, OK? I mean, he's not your husband. I don't know what's gonna happen. Tea? No, thanks. Suze... What? Guess. You... Martin has been commissioned to design a playground for paraplegics. Ramps, slides, etc. All this will occur in sunny Florida. You bought a condominium. I'm pregnant. What? You heard me. But I thought you were going to school. I am. Being pregnant doesn't mean you lie in bed for nine months, Susan. But you'll stop. Temporarily. I can still do both. Well, is that all you have to say? A baby. Oh, that's so incredible. I want to do that. I really want to do that. Anne's always been impetuous. I could never do that. I couldn't take the responsibility. That takes a lot of guts. You think so? Well, could you do it? Maybe. Someday. Have you ever seen Paul Taylor's dance company? No. Well, thanks for wringing out my shirt. Ceil, you know, that's a tray I usually use for pictures. So if you could maybe wash your stuff out in the tub? Oh, I'm sorry. You want to come? Not now. No. It starts at 7:00. Maybe. I studied with him for a while. Really? All you have to do is say you're busy. I'm busy. But you'll come? When I'm not busy anymore. Good. @Hi. Hi. Bermans' contact sheets. That was quick. Dad, come on. We gonna be late. - David's coming in our car, OK? - Fine. Come on, dad. Let's go. We'll go when I'm ready, Peter. I'll meet you in the car. I guess there's not much time for lunch. I did try to call you. H- he managed to get the tickets at the last minute. Yes, Jessie. Yes. Well, it's... isn't the Schieffer Auditorium large enough? I don't know how I got myself talked into this. But it's the last one, Aaron. How many hours? You need two hours? How many chairs? 300 pounds of fruit? That's a lot of fruit, isn't Jessie? It's the last time, Aaron. Yes. Yes, Jessie, right. Well, hello. Hi. You ever been to a football game? No. You keep it that way. Eleanor, this is Susan Weinblatt. Susan, this is my wife Eleanor. I'll meet you in the car, dear. Oh. Sure. I'm in no rush, believe me. Nice to meet you, Susan. I'm sorry, Susan. Hey! Nice shirt. I have one just like it. Its beautiful. I love it. Do you mind? No, it's all right. Anne called. Oh, thanks. Ceil, do you have another place to stay? W- what do you mean? It's not working for me. What? You're staying here. But I... You never let me know I was in your way. Did I do something? No. It's not any one thing. Do you want some money for rent? I just want to be alone. OK. I'd like to see Mr. Carpel. I don't have an appointment, but I don't need much time either. Mr. Carpel never sees anyone without an appointment. It will only take a minute. I'm sorry, but Mr. Carpel never sees anyone without an appointment. Can I make an appointment with him, then? I'm not his secretary. His secretary's the only one who can make an appointment with him, and she's out for lunch. Can I make an appointment with the secretary so I can make an appointment with Mr. Carpel? Why don't you come back later this afternoon? Why don't I? Would you please tell him that Leon Cassini told me to get in touch with him? He did? Would you please tell him that? Mr. Carpel, there's a, uh, Ms.... Weinblatt. Weinblatt here to see you. She says Leon sent her. You can go in now. Where have you shown before? Uh, nowhere. Mm-hmm. You know the story. I mean, you can't have a show until you've... Not bad. Not bad. Thank you. But, uh, they're not for me. Oh. Well, can you suggest another gallery? How do you know Leon? How do I know Leon? I don't. Thought so. He always calls before he sends somebody over. Hello? Beatrice? Yes, Simon. Yeah. Yes, I know. Yes, isn't he? Look, Beatrice, I've got somebody here I think you want to meet. She's good. Yeah. Funny. Uh-huh. All right, then, I will. OK. Yeah, bye. Ciao. She's looking for photographers... new ones. There you are. Thank you. Um, who is Beatrice? Beatrice has excellent taste. She's going to own a very important gallery one of these days. Now, if you'll excuse me, I do have to speak to an angry young man, so, um... Thank you very much. Goodbye. I really appreciate it. I know. Bye. Susan? This is Julie. I need those prints next week. I should be in New York on Tuesday. So call me in Vermont somet time before that so we can figure out where to meet. Bye. Susan? Hi, this is Eric. I... don't know if you remember me. We met at a party a couple of months ago. Call me and leave your number. I'll give you my number. Then you leave your number on my number, OK? 212-475-7173. It's Eric. Can I come up? OK. Hi. Hi. I lost my wallet. Can I use the phone? Yeah, sure. It's over there. I'd like to report a stolen credit card, please... In the last 30 minutes. What credit cards did you lose? All of them. Th-that's correct. No, I don't know the number. So, how are you? - OK. - Allen. Two Is and an "e. " Allen. 135 Broome Street. 1- 0-0- 1-3. This is incredible. I have to replace my bike keys, I need a new faculty card... Thanks. It's just a goddamn pain in the ass, you know? I mean, some clown is going to inherit $35 and an autographed picture of Enos Slaughter. Who's he? He played 19 years in the majors. Lifetime. 300 average. So could you grab the other end of this so I can see where to hang it? So? So what? So, why did you leave? Uh... Well, I was just coming out of a heavy relationship. You were living together? Mm-hmm. Howdy. Oh, hi. You made it. - Is that for me? - Yeah, here. This is terrific, Susan. I got a batch more for you in the trunk of my car. Julie, I'm not going to be able to work for you anymore. What? Did you get another job? Well, actually... I got a show. A show? Yeah. Here. Here? Why didn't you tell me in the first place? Congratulations. Thank you. I'm very impressed. Well, you know... I'm jealous. You? Yes, I am, you squirt. Julie, listen. She's looking for another photographer. Maybe... maybe you should go in and talk to her. I will. OK. Right now. Go ahead. - OK. - OK. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Did you ever get the mumps, big duck? Big ducks don't get the mumps, silly. - No? - No. They only get special diseases, like aim and phobia, savaloney. No, really, Eric. Did you ever get the mumps? Really? Really, really? Really, really. Well... Um... When I was 8, I had the... measles. Yeah? Yeah. When I was 6, I had... chicken pox. Yeah. And... - You don't remember? - I don't remember. What's your number? What do you mean? Your home number. Your parents' number. What are you doing? I'm gonna call your mother. Why? Well, she'll remember if you had them. Well, Susan, I mean, couldn't we just do this later? I mean, what's the big deal about the mumps anyway? If you didn't have them when you were a kid, OK, and you get them now when you're an adult, you know what happens to you? They'll leave you sterile. 914... Yes? Yes? S- O-3... Uh, mom, uh? I just wanted to ask you a question. I was wondering if, uh, if I ever had the mumps. No. No, I'm not sick. I feel... I feel fine. I just have to fill in some form for a... a teaching job, and I remember having the measles and everything, but I... I just didn't remember having... well, maybe you could check with dad, you know. Oh. You sure? OK. Bye. You look like a little duck. Swan. Like to hear my, uh... Song? Your swan song? Yeah. No. This one here I would like in the center, a little bit higher than the others. - Right. - With this one... - That's what I'm saying. You could change the order of those two. Is that possible? No, I can't. This one was taken earlier. - They're all in chronological order. - I see. Hi, Susan. - May I suggest something? - I'll be right with you. How would it be if we just isolated that photograph? OK., fine. Mm-hmm? Now, this one I want on the back with the rest. I'm gonna let you two handle it and I'll go and help Susan, OK? OK. Where were we? Hi. Charlie, the lady needs a light. Two smokers, huh? Tsk tsk. # Dumb # # Young and dumb # # Young and dumb # OK. How do you want your pictures hung, Susan? Well, what do you think? Well, I usually let my artists speak first. Oh. Well, there's a nice one of a bar mitzvah boy. Mm-hmm. And some nice wedding ones. Right. And you can use your judgment. So you're leaving it to me, huh? Yeah. Oh. Terrific. Well, I tell you what. Monday night, come around, check it. And if you want to change anything, we'll change it. - Sounds good. - OK. OK. See you Monday. OK, Beatrice. - Bye-bye. Bye, Charlie. - Bye-bye. Oh, I almost forgot. I have the keys for you. Oh, Susan, I really appreciate this. I get hives staying in a hotel for a week. Ah. I hate this. All right. This is the key for downstairs. You have to jiggle it a little. You sure this is OK? It's fine, really. I spend most of my time at Eric's anyway. Who is this person? A strange, weird person of the male gender. So, where does that leave you? A strange, weird person of the female gender. I'm sorry to bother you, honey, but where's the apple juice bottle? In the fridge. Come on, sweetie. Sweetheart. No. No, sweetie. Mommy's busy now. Where are they? They're supposed to be here 20 minutes ago. That's the second time you've asked me that. Don't worry. They'll be here. Oh, that's very attractive. You don't like it? Come on, Eric. We have to get going. We're late. Susan, uh, would you mind if I didn't go? What? There's this football game on. I really don't want to miss it, you know. But we've been planning this for weeks. I don't... I don't like these field trips. I'm going to do some work later. Eric, Martin and Anne are expecting us. He's going to be wearing his three-piece suit, right? Oh, come on. I don't want to go without you. You'll have a good time. You haven't seen Anne for ages. But I want to be with you. Can I count on you for anything? Yes. I'll be here when you get back. You know we've been waiting over an hour for you? Yeah, I'm really sorry. The least you could is goddamn call me. - I tried. Your number was busy. - I was calling you. I was just trying... I know, you and Eric were in bed. Where is he anyway? He's working. You mean he's not coming? No, he has to work today. You know, other people have lives, too. This is Martin's only day off and it's past time for Rebecca's nap. I said I'm sorry. The world revolves around Susan Weinblatt. Never call me back. Too busy to come over. Annie, it's hard when you're married and I'm alone. Don't you see? No, I don't see. You have your own place... Thanks to you. A job... a show even, a new boyfriend, and you're still free. And you're living in the depths of poverty with a man who beats you 3 times a day, right? I mean, come on, you don't even have to have a job. You have a man who really loves you, and a baby... Yeah, you can't stand it! Oh, no. Wait a minute. You know, you don't know me at all anymore. You really don't. How could you? You haven't been alone for 10 minutes in your entire life! So that's why you don't come over? You're the one who left me. I didn't leave you. I got married. I just wanted more of your time. Bullshit! I couldn't even talk to you, you were so goddam critical. You didn't want to know what I thought. You've already made up your mind, you knew what you were going to do. So? But even if we want different things, I'm still the same person. No, you're not. You're married. He is my husband. You're my friend. Does marriage mean you give up on me? Marriage means the only time I get to see you alone is if Martin is busy. I wanted a friend. I am your friend. Well, I felt betrayed. I think you're selfish. Do you think I'm selfish? Eric, do you think I'm selfish? No. Scared. Those linebackers say, hey, stay out of my territory. If you don't, you're going to take something like this. How many cigarettes did you smoke today? 4,782. Be glad that I brush my teeth. It's not good for your body, you know. You mean, my lungs? Yeah. My lungs are in great shape. You want to see? They're praying for a touchdown. Did you talk to your landlord yet? No. You haven't made up your mind yet, is that correct? Yeah. Susan, it's ridiculous to pay two rents. I don't think it's ridiculous at all. I like my house. Susan, your entire apartment could fit in this place. It's not the size that counts, right, Eric? It's my own place. Great handling by number 71. It's his job to get some penetration, and he did not do it that time. What's the matter? What if nobody comes? - What if nobody likes my pictures? - They won't tell you. That's worse. That's true, except there are always gonna be people that aren't going to like your work, you know? You only do it for your friends. I don't have any friends. Oh, really? No, I don't. What about Anne? Maybe I'm not ready to have a show yet. Wait a minute. You're the one that's always criticizing her for copping out, right? What makes you so different? You won't even take a chance on living with me. Oh, so this is the chance of a lifetime? There are those that would trade places with you, you know. Listen, Eric... When are you getting rid of her paintings? I like her paintings. Well, I don't. You don't like her. I never met the woman in my life. It's her ghost I'm not too thrilled about. Wouldn't they be better if you put some yogurt in? No. I think it would be very good. This is the way I make mashed potatoes. You're very inflexible. Who, me? I don't like you when you're inflexible. I don't like it when you exaggerate to make sure I'll listen to you. Well, I can't stand it when you don't listen to me. I don't like you when you're loud. Well, I don't like you when you're not loud. I don't know why I like you. Because you can tell me why you don't like me. I like me when I don't need you. I don't want you to need me. I want you to want me. Oh, there's no truth like bullshit. Very good, Susan. 2 points. Thank you. That's it. It's ready. I can't eat. How can you eat? Eating never seemed to be a problem with you before. Oh, thank you! Where the hell are you going? Home! Fine! Just stay there, OK!? Who's there? It's me, Julie. What's up? Susan? What is it? Susan? What's the matter? Everything. Is that all? I just had a fight with Eric. I've completely alienated Anne. She doesn't think I'm her friend anymore. Are you? I don't know. I don't know what's going on anymore. What time is it? 10:15. God damn! I blew it. Shit! What? What? The show. The gallery. I didn't see what pictures she hung up. I don't know... Go! Go! See, I'm doing it. Frigging losing myself. Who is that little pussycat? Susan took such a pretty picture of you. She's going to be a famous photographer someday. Yes, she is. Want to know a secret? Let's you and me have a secret, OK? How would you like a little brother or sister? Would you like that? But it's our own private secret. We won't tell daddy just yet, OK? Suze? Is she there? Hi, Julie. How are you? I just called to wish her luck on the show, and you, too. Also, Julie, can you tell her I'm sorry about what happened the other day? She'll understand. OK. I'm OK. - Goddamn critics. - Beatrice. They'll get their asses downtown once we've got the critics. Here. Hey Susan, doesn't it look marvelous, no? Yeah, Beatrice, but there's a problem. Problem? Brace yourself. OK. What's the problem? The problem is you didn't hang up the picture I wanted of the bar mitzvah boy. The bar mitzvah boy? It's right here. No. I meant the closeup. - Oh my God, did you tell me that? - Yeah, I did. And why didn't you come by last night and checked it? I told you to do that, Susan. Sorry, I couldn't make it last night. That's no excuse. What d'you mean you can't make it? It's your exhibition. - Do you think we change it? - No, we can't. It's too late. People are coming. Beatrice, it's my show. I mean, can't we put it up? We can do it fast. No, we can't do it fast. We can't do it at all. You better grow up, you know, Susan, if you're going to stay in this business. Don't let her scare you, Susan. Don't patronize her, Charlie. She's a professional now. Enjoy your show, for Christ's sake. Congratulations. Thanks. You're the one who started me on all this. No. I don't take any of the credit. It's all yours. The Bermans. Oh, Rabbi Gold, I'd like you to meet my parents. This is my mother and my stepfather. Mister... Abe. Abe. Pleased to meet you. Susan. - Hi. - Hi. For you. Oh, for me? Thank you. - You really look beautiful. - Oh, thank you. Terry. - Denise, hi. - Hi, Suze. Hi, Susan. Uh... Listen, Annie's not going to be able to make it. She's not? Why? No. She left for the country this morning. Oh. Uh... by herself? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Has she ever done that before? No. She said she had a lot of work to do, and, uh... She said that you would understand. That I would understand? Yeah. Hey. How you doing? So-so. Where's Annie? She's not coming. I think this is for you. Oh, you're crazy. What am I going to do with this? Well, I thought maybe we could have an early dinner... Or a young dinner. Annie? Susan. What are you doing here? Oh, Suze... I'm sorry. I just... I couldn't... Annie. Are you all right? You know, I haven't been alone more than 10 minutes in my life. I think I've heard that before. The only time I get to work is between 5:00 and 6:30 in the morning. Then it's, you know, very quiet. Did you see Martin? Yeah. He was upset. I had an abortion this morning. He doesn't know. How come? I didn't want to be talked out of it. I feel like such a coward. You're no coward, Annie. How was the show? Did everybody come? Oh, everybody who was anybody came. My mother, my stepfather, Martin, Terry, Eric. How is he? Who? Are you gonna move in with him? You have any salt? Are you? I'm afraid. Of what? Of being left. I know you are. I'm not sure. You're the one that likes to take chances around here. Ah. An illusion, my dear. I'm the biggest turtle I know. Ugh. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Duck. - Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Fuzzy. Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Fuzzy. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Fuzzy. - Duck. - Fuzzy. Uh-oh. I think it's Martin. Anne?
