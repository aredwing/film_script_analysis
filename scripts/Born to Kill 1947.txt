Oh, not from|my own experience, mind you. The little woman and I|have been married 15 years. With nary a cross word, I'll wager. - That's right, nary a one.|- Well, your wife's a very fortunate woman. - I often tell her that.|- I'm certain you do. - Goodbye, and thank you for everything.|- Goodbye. Gangway! Gangway! - Oh, we missed her.|- Yeah! Laury, Laury, what a one you are.|What a one. We'd better be quiet.|They'll hear us upstairs. Who cares? I'll laugh as loud|as I want in my own house. I'll make as much noise as I want. If my roomers wanna move out,|let them. Who cares? Romeo. Down, Romeo. Get down. - He didn't get you dirty?|- No, it's all right. He loves everybody. Just like Laury here. Listen, now. Mrs. Kraft, I'd like to pay my bill.|I'm leaving in the morning. That's right. This was the big day,|wasn't it? - Have some beer.|- I don't think so. Why not? If you're glad about|the divorce, you ought to celebrate. If you're sad and wanna forget,|you ought to celebrate. - Either way, you ought to celebrate.|- Why, here's your bill. - Thank you. I'll give you a check.|- Hop to it. Sally, some more beer. - Stay for supper, huh, Laury?|- Can't. I got a date. - Who with?|- Danny Jadden. - That squirt? Thought you had a new one.|- I have. Wait till you see him. - Tell about him, Laury. What's he like?|- Well, this big across the shoulders. He moved my trunk around|like it was a cracker box. He's the quiet sort, but if you stepped|out of line, he'd kick you in the teeth. My, ain't that wonderful. Sure is. I never knew a man like that.|My two husbands was just turnips. - Most men are.|- Isn't that the truth. If you got a man like that,|why go out with Danny? I'm doing it to needle the new one.|He knows I'm crazy about him. He knows he's got me all wrapped up.|So I've got to start him worrying. It's a bore, but that's the way|to handle men. - Ain't she cold-blooded, though?|- I wouldn't say so. - I'd say she was being practical.|- We're out of beer. - How many times have l...?|- I've got plenty. I'll get some. - No, don't bother.|- Are you sure? I live next door. - It'll only take a minute.|- No. Thank you just the same. I probably won't see you again|before I leave, so goodbye. - Goodbye.|- Goodbye, Mrs. Brent. Goodbye. And good luck|with the new one. Thanks. You know, you ought to put on|some meat, Laury. You're so skinny,|can't grab hold of you anywhere. I haven't noticed anybody|having any trouble. You're a one, Laury Palmer.|You sure are a one. We're all good players.|Get your bets down early. Now, get a hunch and bet a bunch. No time to back up now.|It's time to stack up. That's 31 in the black.|We pay 31, and we pay the black. Let's go, folks.|Keep up that fine play, now. Leave a little, take a little. Come on, dice. Be good to me, boy. Seven, odds. You lost. Next shooter. - Five dollars, sir.|- Thank you. Coming out. A shooter, and a good one. What will he do, win or lose?|Make your bets. You bet dice, do or don't pass. Coming out again. Here he comes.|Coming out. Make your bets. Bet dice, win or lose.|Here they come. Coming out. Eight is your point. Eight will win. What will it come,|field, big six or big eight? Eight the winner. Pay the line. Make your bets. Bet dice.|Do or don't pass. Coming out again, same shooter.|Here he comes, win or lose. Here they come, coming out.|You bet dice, do or don't pass. Coming out again.|Same good shooter. Here he comes. Coming out. You bet dice, win or lose. Keep rolling. What will it come, six, eight, field or come?|Coming out. Here they come. Four's your point. Make four. Four will win. Will he come, will he field? Make four. Four the winner. Pay the line. Coming out again. Same shooter,|the good one. Here he comes. Coming out. - Hi, Mrs. Brent.|- Oh, good evening. - Cleaning them out?|- Not exactly. Danny and I lost our shirts. - This is Danny Jadden.|- How do you do? Hi. How are you? Shall we run along|and try our luck someplace else? Sure. The night's young.|Glad to have met you, Mrs. Brent. - Thank you.|- Goodbye. - Goodbye.|- So long. Coming out. Coming out again, same shooter,|the good one. What will he do, win or lose? Eight is your point, make eight.|Eight will win. Come on in. - Let's have a nightcap.|- Baby, you got yourself a boy. Hello, Romeo. Hello, sweet. You know where everything is.|Go and fix the drinks. - I'll be with you in a minute.|- Okay, baby. Hello. Get out. Come on, Mac. Let's talk this out|over a couple of drinks. - What do you say?|- I say, get out. Kind of abrupt, ain't you? - I came for a drink and I'm gonna have it.|- You heard me. Look, I'm here now.|You can come back some other time. What you getting steamed up about?|She ain't no Queen of Sheba. Sheba or no, no man's big enough|to cut me out. Maybe so, and maybe not. My heavens, what are you doing, Danny? Sounds like you're tearing|the house apart. The racket you're making, you... Danny. Danny. Oh, Sam. Well, down, down. No. Well, aren't you out late tonight, Romeo? Yes, you ought to be home,|you little tramp. Come on. Oh, no, you'll get right out again.|Inside for you. Hello, information? What's the number|of the railroad station? Thank you. Where you been? Out. No. Who with, the Palmer dame? If we're gonna carry on a conversation,|it'd help for you to talk. The Palmer dame's dead. Why'd you do it, Sam? I had to. She caught me with him. - Him?|- That kid. They were making a monkey out of me. I wouldn't have killed her too, but she|walked in and saw the kid lying there. I was scared something like this would|happen. The way you go off your head. It's been worse lately. Ever since|that nervous crack-up last summer. Honest, Sam. You go nuts about nothing.|Nothing at all. You gotta watch that. You can't kill people whenever you want.|It's not feasible. - Why isn't it?|- All right, Sam. All right, it is. - He was cutting in on me.|- With her? - That was a big worry, I'll bet.|- It's not that. It's just that I never let anybody|cut in on me on anything. I can have anything I want|if I put my mind to it. Sure, Sam, sure. When I want it, I take it.|Nobody cuts in. Of course, Sam. He must've been crazy|thinking he stood a chance... ...with the dame after she got|a load of you. - Anyone spot you there?|- Not that I know of. - Anyone see you with her?|- I don't watch everybody that looks at me. Take it easy, will you, Sam?|I'm trying to help you, that's all. There's a train out of here in an hour|for San Francisco. You'll be on it. - Are you coming?|- No, I'll stick here till this dies down. I'll check what leads they've got.|See if anybody saw you, and who. You get out, call me when you're set.|Need any dough? No. Buy your ticket after|you get on the train. And, Sam, in the meantime,|no dames, understand? I've got a dame on my mind,|and she's dead. And that's plenty for me. I'll take those for you. Well, that's very kind of you. - What's your Pullman number?|- I haven't one. They're sold out. - That's too bad. Have you got a ticket?|- Yes. Well, good. Let's go. - Which car, sir?|- This is it. There must be some mistake.|There's no room. Don't worry. Which way's the club car? - It's the next car, but it's closed, sir.|- Well, right now it's opening again. Well, now at least we won't get|thrown off till the next stop. Don't worry. Nobody's gonna|throw us off. What an assured man. Know what you want, be sure you'll get it,|and you can't miss. I found that out early. Most people don't know|what they want out of life. - I'll bet you do.|- Do I? Yes. Yes, I do. Exactly. Don't you? I know what I want when I see it. - Smoke?|- No, thank you. I saw you once before this evening. - Remember?|- Yes. You didn't play long. No. I don't like gambling very much. I don't like being at the mercy|of white squares... ...that decide whether you win or lose.|I like to have the say-so myself. You're not a turnip, are you? - A turnip?|- Yes. We were saying... ...Mrs. Kraft, where I roomed,|and Laury, a friend of hers... ...that most men are turnips. You may have noticed Mrs. Palmer. She spoke to me at the dice table|this evening. Yes, I believe I did notice her. Anyhow, you're not. - Not what?|- A turnip. - Do you like that?|- Yes. I like that very much. - Do you live in San Francisco?|- Yes. Good. Why good? Because that's where I'm gonna be|for some time. Well, when am I gonna see you again? Let me call you|when I get straightened around. I don't know where I'm gonna be.|Better give me your number. Well, you'll be staying at a hotel,|won't you? Look, if you don't wanna see me again,|just say so. If I didn't want to, I'd tell you. That's what I thought. Why not stay at the Terrace Hotel? I'm sure you can get a room there,|and it's a nice, quiet place. Do you like it? - Yes.|- Then it's the Terrace. Somebody meeting you|when we get off the ferry? - No. I'm going to pick up a cab.|- Swell. We'll share one. I'm afraid not.|We go in different directions. That's where you're wrong. We're going in the same direction,|you and I. - Here's your laundry, Mrs. Perth.|- Okay. That coffee smells good. Funny how coffee|never tastes as good as it smells. As you grow older, you'll discover|that life is very much like coffee: The aroma is always better|than the actuality. - May that be your thought for the day.|- Yeah, sure. Telephone. Hello? Mr. Arnett? Who's calling? No, he's not here. I don't know when he'll be back. - A debtor, I take it.|- Yep. Speaking of debt, you ain't paid your share|of the phone for three months, Arnett. Et tu, Brutus? I ain't talking about what you "et."|That's on the house. But I want $8.55 for the phone. That would leave me|embarrassingly short. - Now, look...|- But... ...I have a prospective client. The one that called here on Tuesday. I am meeting her|in exactly three minutes. And I shall extract a sizable retainer,|have no fear. What does this one want? Is her husband stepping out on her,|or what? Murder. - Mrs. Kraft?|- Obviously. Who'd you expect? Quite so. It distresses me|that we must meet here... ...but they are redecorating my suite,|and I cannot tolerate the smell of paint. - I hope you're a good detective.|- Didn't someone refer you to me? No. Your name just came first|in the classified phone book. Well, I've been in this business|some 20 years. Being still alive, the deduction is|I have not starved at my trade. - That beer.|- Does it every time. Well, Mrs. Kraft, how can I serve you? You can serve me by finding the rat|who killed poor Laury. She had the best time of anybody|I ever knew, that Laury Palmer. Just hearing her tell about her doings|was all the fun I had left in life. So now whoever did her in|is gonna get his. I'll see to that. You realize, of course, Mrs. Kraft, that|this will be a particularly difficult case. I have had no opportunity to inspect|the scene of the crime or evidence. I have none of the advantages|enjoyed by the police. - I know all that.|- So under these circumstances... ...I cannot promise you anything|but effort. - That is, if I'm retained.|- You're retained, so hop to it. First, there is a slight|monetary transaction. How much? Five hundred dollars|should retain me nicely. Five hundred?|You think I'm a millionaire? Laury Palmer left you her house|and quite a nice bit of money. How do you know? I'm a detective. Remember? - What about the Fifty-Two Club?|- Remember the New Year's we spent there? - I certainly do.|- You had order after order of crepe suzette. That was my New Year's resolution,|to have my fill of crepe suzette. The poor little man, he almost burned|the bottom out of the chafing dish. A gentlemen to see you, Mrs. Brent.|A Mr. Wild. Oh, ask him to come in, please. - Hello.|- Hello there. I didn't expect you. - I was at loose ends, thought I'd drop by.|- How very nice. This is my sister.|Georgia Staples, Sam Wild. - How do you do?|- How do you do? And Fred Grover, my fiance. - Hello.|- Hiya. Mr. Wild and I came down from Reno|on the same train. - Won't you sit down?|- No, thanks. I see you're going out. - There's no hurry.|- Except that I'm so hungry... ...I can hardly stagger around.|- No matter what, Fred has to eat. You know, I think that indicates|a deterioration of the moral fiber. Perhaps it's a compensatory thing.|You know, lack of emotional satisfaction. I'll be running along. Nice to meet you. Why don't you ask Mr. Wild|to come with us, Helen. - Thanks. I don't wanna barge in on a party.|- It's just the three of us. As a matter of fact,|I'm the, quote, "extra woman," unquote. You'd be saving me|from that hideous fate. Mr. Wild undoubtedly has other things|to do, Georgia. Why, no. Strangely enough, I haven't. Well, then, let's go.|Get your paraphernalia, girls. Well, Helen, you just missed|a thing in Reno. - Quite a horrible murder.|- Close to where you were staying. - Have they any idea who did it?|- No. No, not yet. - It's a gruesome picture.|- That's what sells papers. Go on and get your things. You can|lap up the juicy details when you get home. Wonder why women|are so fascinated by murder. Much more so than men.|You ever noticed? No, I haven't. That murder happened|the night before you left. - Didn't you hear anything about it?|- No. I left early the next morning. - Were both their pictures in the paper?|- Yes, she was quite a good-Iook... How did you know|two people were murdered? - You didn't even look at the paper.|- I... Well, I... As a matter of fact,|I discovered the bodies. - What?|- I'd rather you not mention it. Didn't you scream? - Why didn't you call the police?|- On account of Fred. You know he loathes anything|bordering on sensationalism. Getting involved with that|is sure to be messy. Besides, it's a lot of bother.|Coroner's inquest and all that stuff. Well, that seems a rather self-centered|way of looking at it, somehow. I don't think so. If I had information,|it'd be different. But I couldn't tell them anything,|could I? - Well, maybe you're right.|- Of course I'm right. - Will you take care of this?|- Certainly, Mr. Grover. Thank you, Pierre. I ordered something special|to celebrate your return. - Wonderful.|- Oh, this is my very favorite piece. Come on, Fred, let's dance. - You don't mind, do you, Helen?|- I certainly do. - But go ahead.|- Thank you, my sweet. Why him? Well, that's a weird question. I wanna know. I don't get it. Doesn't it occur to you|that I might be in love with Fred? - He's no guy you'd be in love with.|- Have it your way. Like to dance? No, thanks. Afraid? Afraid? Of what? You might change your mind|about marrying him. Nothing in the world could change|my mind about marrying Fred. - Why don't you? What are you waiting for?|- Fred's mother died recently. Naturally, he wants to wait a few months. I think I could change your mind|about this marriage deal if I decided to. Well, what's so funny?|You wanted to see me again. Let's not confuse the issue. Seeing you again had nothing whatsoever|to do with Fred and me. Oh, I see. You'll cross the tracks on Tuesdays|and May Day with goodies for the slum kid. But back you scoot, and fast, to|your own high-toned neck of the woods. I wouldn't say that. No, you wouldn't say it,|but that's the way it is. Too much of a crowd for me. Well, Fred, when I'm your age,|I don't suppose I'll be able to take it either. - Helen, may I borrow your mirror?|- Yes, help yourself. Here's your wedding ring. Aren't you supposed to throw it over|the fence as soon as you get your divorce? I would if I were you, but I've got to think|of the diamonds. I can always hock them. Oh, Helen, that's silly.|I've told you before... ...I don't want you to think|about money. Isn't it marvelous to be a poor relation|and have people insist... ...upon pressing gold|into your little fist? - Say, aren't you two sisters?|- Yes. You mean, why am I the poor relation? - You see, we're really foster sisters.|- All right, if you must split hairs about it. But we are, darling.|Georgia's father was the tycoon. He founded the town's|biggest newspaper. Naturally, when he died,|he left everything to Georgia. You've no idea how this bother about|"money, who's got the money?" bores me. Will you dance with me, Sam? Why, certainly. - Cigarette, darling?|- Oh, yes, thank you. This guy your sister's marrying,|this Grover, he's rich, isn't he? Very. He's the Grover Steel Company. - Why?|- Oh, just curious. That's how it ought to be, somebody|with money marrying somebody without. Sort of evens things up. - You've never been married, have you?|- No. - Why not?|- Oh, I don't know, I... You've had plenty of offers. Well, l... What makes you think|I've been besieged with offers? Well, that's simple. You've got|everything a man would want. You're young, warm, pretty. You could really love a man. - I'm sorry.|- Why are you nervous? - You've heard all this before.|- I'm not nervous. Well, as a matter of fact,|it's a little bit disconcerting... ...to have someone you scarcely know|be quite so frank. Why? Is it wrong to come out|with what's in your head? No, it's not wrong, it's... - It's just that I'm not used to it, that's all.|- We'll have to change all that. Because there's a lot more in my head|I wanna tell you. Hi. Would you call my face pretty? - Did he?|- Who? - Don't be coy.|- He's a very attractive guy, isn't he? And different too. You know, I've never met|anyone like him before. - When are you seeing him again?|- Lunch, tomorrow. - What does he do? Do you know?|- No. Well, what did you talk about|all the way down on the train? My divorce, Reno. Helen, was it awful, those six weeks? It wasn't what you'd call|an enriching experience. Well, at least it was some kind|of an experience. I never seem to have any kind. I think, darling, you're just about|to have one. Hello. Yeah, go ahead. Hello.|- Hello, Mart. Sam. What's doing? It's been quieting down.|- Good. Nothing points to you.|- Sure, I knew it'd be okay. I wasn't worried. Where you staying?|- Terrace Hotel. Everything all right?|- Yeah. I got news for you, Mart. Getting married? Quit kidding. When are you gonna do it? Who's the gal? Georgia Staples. She's an orphan. Her old man left her|San Francisco's biggest newspaper. Sounds like the big league.|- Sure, it's the big league. You bet. Yeah. We'll not only be rolling in dough... ...but marrying into this crowd|will fix it so as I can... So as I can spit in anybody's eye. Hurry down here. I don't know how long|I'll be able to hold her off. I'll be there in a couple days.|- Okay, boy. I'll be seeing you. Hey, taxi. - Take me to 4106 Calvert Street.|- Yes, sir. - Hello.|- Hi. May I ask what's going on here?|Some sort of celebration? A wedding.|Georgia Staples is getting married. Is that right? Who is she marrying? I don't know. Some lucky stiff. Yep. Well... How do you do, madam? I thought you'd have use for an|accomplished dishwasher or dish drier. - No.|- Or a garbage disposer, perhaps. You see, madam, I may not show it... ...but food and I have been strangers|since the day before yesterday. Well, come in. Can't turn a hungry man|away from a wedding feast. - Thank you, ma'am.|- This stuff's no good for a hungry man. - How about a turkey leg?|- Oh, anything will do. Anything. Thank you so much. Isn't that Mr. Wild the cutest thing? His eyes get me. They run up|and down you like a searchlight. Yeah. Those whom God has joined together,|let no man put asunder. Forasmuch as Samuel and Georgia|have consented together in holy wedlock... ...and have witnessed the same|before God and this company... ...and have given and pledged their troth,|each to the other... ...and have declared the same by giving|and receiving a ring... ...and by joining hands, I pronounce that|they are man and wife. I hope you both will be|very, very happy. - Thank you, Father.|- Thank you. Congratulations, Sam. - Georgia, I hope you'll be very happy.|- Thank you, darling. - Mrs. Wild.|- Congratulations. Hello, sister. - Congratulations, Sam.|- What a lucky guy. - Thanks.|- Congratulations, Sam. - Congratulations.|- Thanks, Mart. Tired? Yes. Helen... - You didn't seem to like it very much.|- What? Their getting married. No. Naturally. - Did it show?|- To me. Sam's not in Georgia's class.|You know that. - It was concern for Georgia?|- Well, certainly. Then why did you let|the wedding go through? How could anyone stop a woman|from marrying Sam? Is he actually so attractive to women? - Is he, Helen?|- Oh, really, Fred. You pick the most hideous times|to badger me. I'm tired. I've had to handle this whole thing,|and I'm upset about Georgia. I'm sorry, my sweet. I didn't realize I was badgering you. - Well, I've come to say goodbye.|- Nice of you. So sad, goodbyes, don't you think? - Saying goodbye to you is.|- Smooth. Simply smooth. - You don't believe I mean that, do you?|- With bells on. Do you mind? No, go ahead. I don't drink much. - I don't need it.|- That's where we're different. Everybody's different from everybody else|in some ways. You fancy yourself an intelligent man,|don't you? - I don't like that remark.|- So if you don't like it, I mustn't say it. I think you've had too much to drink. Do you know what I think? I think you've|got a secret of some kind, haven't you? Well, haven't you? Why does your face go tight|all of a sudden sometimes? What about this friend of yours,|this pug you brought to the house? Anything else you'd like to know? Yes. Why do you stay away from me? You haven't said two words to me|since you first came here. - Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.|- Stop that phony intellectual patter... ...you climbing faker! - Sorry, that was rotten to say.|- No, you're right. I'm nobody much. But I'll make myself|a lot more than I am. I can do it, too. - You don't think I can, do you?|- I haven't given it a thought. You know, Sam... ...the way you kissed Georgia|after the ceremony was very convincing. You were the perfect picture|of the ardent young husband... ...faithful unto death. Why shouldn't I be? Don't you realize|my wife's very attractive? - I know you realize you're very attractive.|- Now, that was a fine thing to say. You can't even remember all the women|who've been mad about you. - Can you remember all your men?|- Leave me out of this. Okay. Just one more thing. Georgia's my sister,|and I love her very much. After all she's done for you,|you'd be crazy if you didn't. You don't know anything, do you? You're talking about her money,|and I hate her for her money. Every time she pays a bill... ...every time I see something I don't own,|I'm only borrowing... ...I hate her for her money. That's nice of me, isn't it? After all|she's given me without even thinking. I know how you feel. There's more to it than that. Her money has made her something|that I'll never be. She's completely innocent. She has a perfect faith|that if she asks someone a question... ...they'll give her the right answer. Anyhow, I love Georgia, and if you do|anything to hurt her, I'm your enemy. And I make a very bad enemy, too. Goodbye... ...sister. - Mrs. Brent.|- Yes, Grace, what is it? There's a man in the kitchen asking|lots of questions about Mr. Wild. I thought you'd better see him. Thank you. About how long has Mr. Wild|been courting Miss Staples? I don't know, a few weeks. My, how quickly love flowers|in the hearts of the young. They're getting ready to leave. Honest, that Mr. Wild, he just makes me|water at the kneecaps. Obviously, Mr. Wild is a gentleman|the ladies take to. - Yeah.|- I won't waste your time or mine... ...by letting you lie about who you are.|Would you give me your wallet, please? Perhaps this might all be less painful|if we discuss it in private. Would you mind waiting in the pantry?|It will only take a minute. He said he was hungry. A detective. Or operative,|as we euphemistically call it. I'm not interested in your|professional drolleries, Mr. Arnett. I want to know why you're asking questions|about Mr. Wild... ...and who your client is. Naturally, I cannot reveal the name|of my client. Your ethics touch me deeply. Noblesse oblige. - I see that I shall have to call the police.|- That would be extremely unwise. It might involve Mr. Wild|even more seriously... ...in an already very serious matter. Good day. I hope Mr. And Mrs. Wild will|have a most enjoyable honeymoon. Grace. Show this man out at once, please. Oh, and, Grace... ...you didn't tell him anything|about Mr. Wild, just by accident? For instance, you didn't tell him|about his visitors? But Mr. Wild hasn't had any visitors... ...except the gentleman who arrived|for the wedding today. Helen. We've been looking for you. Maggie Macy just told me|you're moving in with her. - What in heaven made you dream that up?|- You should have your house to yourself. Darling, that's silly. You'll be leaving anyway, as soon as you|get married. That won't be long. - Maybe she doesn't like me.|- Why, Sam, I adore you. Of course I'll stay. - Have a wonderful trip.|- Thank you, darling. - Georgia, dear.|- Yes. It was a silly idea, moving out. Goodbye, brother. Goodbye. Come on, darling. - Better hurry.|- You'll miss your train. - Come on, everyone, they're leaving.|- That man's gone. I hope his coming didn't upset you,|Mrs. Brent. Upset me? Why, no. His coming here made me feel wonderful. With the keys to the city|right in my hand. Goodbye. Drop us a line, will you? Why did you call me? I was shopping and thought it would|be nice to have a cocktail. When Sam introduced us,|you made it clear... ...that my being in your house was strictly|Sam's idea and strictly a bad one. I know. I was rude. I was wondering if you'd forgive me|and forget about it. It's all right. Forget it. I thought we'd have a line from|Georgia and Sam by now, but no. I don't know about Georgia,|but Sam's no letter writer. - You've known him a long time?|- Yeah. Yeah, Sam and I lived together|five years now. Why didn't you come to San Francisco|when Sam did? I had some business to take care of|and... Wait a minute. Seems to me we're doing|a lot of question-and-answer stuff. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.|Really not. - Drink up and let's have another shot.|- Good. I must warn you, though,|liquor makes me nosy. I've been known to ask all sorts of|personal questions after cocktails. It's all right. I've been known to tell people|to mind their own business. Cold sober, too. Grace. - Hello, Fred.|- Hello. - I didn't expect you tonight.|- What is all this? - All what?|- About Mart Waterman moving in. Grace said that you phoned and asked her|to get a room ready for him. Yes, I've invited Mart to stay here. - What made you do that?|- He's Sam's closest friend. It's silly for him to stay at a hotel|when we have empty rooms. I don't know why it didn't|occur to me days ago. I don't like the idea at all. - Having this man in the house with you...|- But, Fred, Grace is here. - That's not the point.|- Oh, don't be stuffy. At the risk of seeming mid-Victorian,|I want you to ask him not to come. - But how can I do that now?|- Invent some excuse. It's not difficult. But it is, darling.|I just can't do things like that. You mean you won't. Oh, Fred, really, I don't see why|you should... Will you stop?|I'm sick of hearing how stupid I am. - That sounds like Georgia and Sam.|- So soon? But they weren't coming back|for another week. - Work is fine, but what you want...|- All right, skip it. - Sam, it's such a silly...|- I said, skip it, and I meant skip it. Hello, Sam. Hello, darling. - Have a good trip?|- Yes, wonderful. Yes, until I spoiled it|with my crazy notion. Sam wants to run the paper. Darling, if you'd had any business|experience at all... But you've been a fighter and managed|a cattle ranch or two. How could you know anything|about running a newspaper? I told Sam if he'd only take a job|in the office to start with... ...till he learned the business... Look, Sam, you wouldn't suddenly... Georgia and I can settle this|without anybody else butting in. Sam, Fred's part of the family. - He has a right to butt in, as you call it.|- So he doesn't like it. Only because it doesn't make sense, Sam.|Does it to you, Helen? No, it doesn't. - I'm sorry I made a scene.|- Oh, now. It's just that I... I don't know.|I can't stand fighting with Sam. - Easy does it, Georgia.|- It won't seem so tragic in the morning. No, I suppose it won't. Good night. - Night.|- Night. - Well, I'll call you tomorrow.|- Fred. - You're angry with me.|- No. - Sure not?|- Yes. You do see that I can't cancel|that invitation, don't you, darling? Yes. Well, aren't you gonna kiss me|good night? Good night, Helen. Helen. Helen. Why were you against me tonight? You don't know what I have in me.|You don't know what I can do. I can run that paper, and better|than most, if I had a chance. - I believe you could.|- Then why were you against me? Because Fred was. And you love Fred desperately. I love Fred. You love Fred. Why this sudden passion|to run the paper? I'd be on top. I could make people or break them. I could do that. Do you understand? Yes. I think I do. Sure you do. Because your roots are down|where mine are. I knew that the first time I saw you. Soul mates, huh? Stop laughing. Well, for a man who's just returned from|his honeymoon with an attractive wife... ...you're very ardent. What's wrong with you?|You know how I feel about Georgia. - Do I?|- Unless you're a fool. She means no more to me|than Fred to you. Very interesting. - I must get this milk to Georgia.|- He means nothing to you. Say it. - He does, though.|- What? What, Helen? Fred is peace and security. - It's his money, then.|- Yes, partly. All my life I've lived on other people's|money. Now I want some of my own. But there's another kind of security|that Fred can give me. Without him,|I'm afraid of the things I'll do. Afraid of what I might become. Fred is goodness and safety. And what am I? You? You're strength, excitement... ...and depravity. There's a kind of|corruptness inside of you. That would drive most women off. - Yes.|- But not you. You have guts. Georgia told me how you found those two|in Reno. You had guts then. - You didn't yell or faint.|- No. And it wasn't only finding them dead,|it was the way they were dead. The kid jammed in the doorway,|the Palmer dame under the sink. - Blood on her hair.|- Blood all over. You didn't yell. No, I didn't. Helen. Oh, there you are. - What are you doing here?|- I'm moving in. - Whose idea was that?|- Helen suggested it. Good night. You sure picked a fine time to bust in. I need a drink. Hello, I want to speak to Albert Arnett|in Reno, please. Do you know the number?|- Yes. What is the number, please?|- 22-766. Who's calling, please?|- I'm Mrs. Brent. Thank you. I'll call it.|- Thank you. You got a good-Iooking wife with|all the dough not locked up in the mint. - Play it close to your vest.|- Meaning what? Leave Helen alone. - Why?|- I just told you. Not that I blame you, of course.|Helen's a creamy dish, but she's... I ever catch you looking at Helen,|I'll tear your throat out. - Oh, Sam...|- Never mind the "Oh, Sam." Just remember what I told you. No, I don't want to talk to anyone else|in Reno. Just find out where Mr. Arnett|can be reached in San Francisco, please. - What's wrong?|- Helen. She just phoned a guy in Reno. - Reno?|- I don't get her. I don't get her at all. - Maybe I was a fool. I would have sworn...|- What? Maybe not. Maybe she is against me. I don't know. She puts herself|in my arms and tries to trap me. - She feels and digs and looks inside of me.|- Sam, Sam, take it easy. We'll work it out somehow.|Just take it easy. "Where every prospect pleases,|and only man is vile." That quotation occurs to me|quite often in my profession. Mr. Arnett, I've been very curious|to know what progress you've made... ...since I last saw you. I've done rather well. How well? My investigation concerning Mr. Wild|is almost complete. And when you fill in what's missing...? I shall turn everything over to my client,|who, I believe, will inform the police. Naturally, I'm deeply interested. - After all, it does concern my brother-in-law.|- So it does. And it would be very trying|for all of us... ...if he were linked up with anything like...|- Like murder? Unfortunately, Mr. Wild is already|linked up with it. In fact, I would go so far as to say|that not only is he linked up with it... ...but he's the chief performer|in this case. I presume that so far your client|knows nothing. Your presumption is correct. - Mr. Arnett, I...|- It's quite all right, Mrs. Brent. I am a man of integrity, but I'm always|willing to listen to an interesting offer. - Well, I'm prepared to pay handsomely.|- Good. Obstructing the wheels of justice|is a costly affair. - Five thousand dollars should do it.|- Fifteen thousand dollars should do it. I think you're basing your demands|on false premises, Mr. Arnett. - I am not a rich woman.|- I know that. But your sister is very rich. So is Mr. Grover,|whom you are planning to marry. Seven thousand. Fifteen. I doubt very much if I can manage|to get it. In that case, I shall have to|forge ahead with my inquiry. And may I remind you that Nevada courts|have rather puritanical views. Why, some of our more|impassioned juries even insist... ...that a man who commits murder|pay with his life. You know, Mrs. Brent,|I'm a simple man. And I'm somewhat confused about|your motive in protecting Mr. Wild. He's my sister's husband.|It should be quite obvious. He was your sister's husband when|I came to your house the first day... ...and you had no intention|of protecting him then. In fact, you went out of your way|to supply me with information... ...which might assist me. Of course,|Mr. Wild is a most attractive man... ...and I suppose even a sister-in-law... ...on sufficient acquaintance... ...might succumb to his charms. Good night. Good night. Has it occurred to you? Neither of us looks like|a scoundrel, do we? - Where have you been?|- That's my affair. Where have you been? Seeing a man called Albert Arnett.|He's a detective. Seeing him about what? He has a client who thinks you committed|a murder. I told him that was fantastic. I knew you hadn't committed|any murder. - How'd you find out about him?|- He was at your wedding. It occurred to me it might be awkward|if he went around asking questions... ...even though the whole thing|is ridiculous. So I decided to stop it. - That isn't why you went.|- It is. - You're lying.|- Take it easy, Sam. I don't think she is. - Whose side are you on, anyway?|- Oh, Sam. You certainly make it tough for people|who are on your side. What did she say|that detective's name was? Arnett. Mrs. Kraft, please. - 618.|- Thank you. - Deal.|- Gotta add up. - Why?|- Find out who won. - I won.|- Who says? - Don't argue!|- You won. - How's the search coming along?|- That's what I'm gonna find out. - Shut that, will you? Cold's eating into me.|- Pleasure, pleasure. Well, did you ever get around|to playing cards with Virginia? - Virginia?|- I thought so. You're no Casanova with women.|Those were all lies you fed me. You're a poor substitute for Laury. - Are you calling me a liar?|- Yes. You're a liar, all right. And you are a cheat. What makes you say that? - Can I help you?|- Yes. Well, the 10 of diamonds|we were looking for. Why, sure enough. Yes. - See who it is.|- Yeah. Oh, it's you. That's all. Take you on tomorrow,|and I'll beat you again. Yeah, in a pig's eye. Quite a delightful surprise,|your coming to San Francisco. But a needless trip, if I may say so.|May I help you? I've got nothing to keep me in Reno. And I wanted to be on the spot|when you caught the skunk. Now, Mrs. Kraft, I didn't say|he was here. - What made you come here, then?|- Look, a certain young man came here. This young man I remembered seeing|outside Mrs. Palmer's house... ...at police headquarters, at the funeral|parlor where Mrs. Palmer was laid out. Poor Laury. I hope she's in heaven now. Although I don't know as Laury|would have much fun up there. Go on, this man you saw|at the funeral parlor, is he the one? No. But he gave me a lead. What good's a lead? It's high time|you found out something. Mrs. Kraft... ...in a few days, either my suspicions|will be verified... ...and we will have our quarry... ...or I will have failed you. Which will be exceedingly painful|to a man of my integrity. It won't hurt half as much as me|to lose my $500. Speaking of money,|I have a little expense account... ...which I thought I'd leave with you,|for traveling and incidentals. Boy, you really blow yourself|with those incidentals, don't you? All right, Mrs. Kraft. Thank you. - Yes?|- How do you do, Mrs. Kraft? Who are you?|Take your foot out of my door. What I wanna talk to you about|concerns Laury Palmer. Thank you. Well? Now, you don't expect me to tell you|just like that. It's not feasible. How much is it gonna cost me? Well, I'm not gonna do much,|so I won't need much. - A C-note should make me very happy.|- Now, I suppose. No. I'll prove to you|I'm strictly on the level. Tonight will be all right, after I show you|what you're looking for. Fair enough. How come you got ahold|of this information? Through underworld connections,|like it says in the newspapers. - I'm a bad boy.|- You are, huh? - Have some beer.|- No, thanks. Beer makes me sleepy. - I don't like it.|- Me, I love it. I love it the best in the world. I loved Laury too. Yeah, I'm at the barren tail end of my life,|and Laury was all I had. Laury and the bottle. Well, there's nothing I can do|for the bottle... ...but I'm sure not gonna let Laury down.|- That's right. You and Laury stick together. Mrs. Kraft, here's a map of San Francisco|and vicinity. You see this corner I've marked here? I better write it down for you. You pick up a cab tonight|and drive out there... ...alone. - I'll be waiting for you.|- What time? Eleven o'clock. Remember, glamour girl,|I'll do this on just one condition. - What's that?|- That you don't make any passes at me... ...when you get me out there.|I'm a very shy kid. Yes? Are you turning in right away? No. I was just going to read. Did you|want to see me about something? Yes. I wanted to talk to you about Sam. He's a great guy, Sam,|but he's kind of impulsive. Well, he's the sort of guy that punches|first and asks questions later. Now, you... I think you're different.|I think you figure things close. So that's why I took a chance on having my|head beat open and came in here tonight. The way I see it, it's not feasible|for you and Sam to keep on... Well, what I mean is... ...Sam's married to a lovely little wife,|and you're engaged to Mr. Grover. - Right, I am.|- Don't get mad. I am getting mad. I resent people marching|into something that doesn't concern them. You think it doesn't.|It concerns me if it concerns Sam. Suppose you discuss it with Sam, then. I tried to tell you about him.|He won't listen to what I have to say. And I'm not interested. Well, I got it off my chest, anyhow. - Good night.|- Good night. - Who is it?|- It's me, Sam. Can I come in? Yeah. Well, I found the client. She's at the Felton Hotel.|Her name's Kraft. - She was Palmer's pal.|- Yeah? I got everything fixed.|I'm gonna meet her in a little while. What a glamour girl. - Sam.|- What? Are you sure this is the way|you want it handled? - Why?|- I just asked. - I don't mind, if it's the most feasible way.|- I'm sure this is how I want it handled. Okay. Have you figured out what|we're gonna do with the detective? - No.|- Well, don't let it worry you. We've come through|everything so far, haven't we? - Yeah.|- So long. So long, Mart. - How much?|- Two-seventy, please. - Keep the change.|- Thank you. Are you sure this is the corner? There are no buses or streetcars|around here if you get stuck. - This is it, all right.|- Okay, lady. - Hi, glamour girl.|- Hello. Well, now that we're both here,|we can be on our way. - On our way?|- We've got a little bit of a walk. Out there. - You don't mind, do you?|- I sure do mind. I ain't built for gallivanting around|in the sand. I'll help you if the going gets rough.|You can depend on me, glamour girl. This is pulling my legs out|of their sockets. - How much further do we go?|- No further. Well, I don't see a thing here.|What have you got to show me? The moral is, don't hire detectives. Take it easy, glamour girl. You shouldn't feel so bad.|You've lived a long life. You're no spring chicken, you know. Glamour girl. Who is it? - It's me, Mart. Your old pal Sam.|- What's the matter with you, Sam? Sam, what's this all about? Sam, take that knife away. What did I do?|I was out here tonight for you. - In Helen's room for me too, I suppose.|- I was. I was trying to save you trouble. - In her room?|- It wasn't like it looked. - It wasn't. I swear, Sam.|- Wasn't it? Sam, take that knife away|so I can talk to you. I knew you'd listen to me, Sam. Here's how it was, Sam... You're crazy, Sam. Mrs. Brent. Mrs. Brent. The police are downstairs, Mrs. Brent. They say Mr. Waterman|was murdered last night. I'll be right down. - Grace.|- Yes, ma'am? - Have you told Mr. And Mrs. Wild yet?|- Yes, Mrs. Brent. How long had Mr. Waterman been living|in your house, Mrs. Wild? About a week. Did anyone telephone him|or see him during that time? No, sir. No one that I know of. Mr. Wild, what exactly was|your relationship to Mr. Waterman? He was a friend of mine. A good friend.|Down on his luck. Have you any idea why he was|on the dunes last night? - No, I haven't.|- When did you see him last? He came into my room|for a few minutes about 9:30. We talked casually, then he said he|thought he'd go out for a while and left. - He didn't mention where he was going?|- No. I see. Well, what time was that,|did you say? About 9:30. I'm fairly sure of that|because I felt restless after he left, and I... I asked Mrs. Brent to play cards|with me for a while. My wife had had a headache and had gone|to bed right after dinner. And how long did you and Mr. Wild|play cards, Mrs. Brent? Oh, I should say till about midnight. Well, I think that's all for now. We may have to drop in on you|again, though. Of course. Any time you wish. Thanks. - Goodbye.|- Goodbye. Well, I'm going to get into some clothes.|How about you, Helen? No, I think I'll have some coffee first. Darling, I know how dreadful|this is for you. You fool. You stupid, crazy fool. Do you think the world is yours?|You can crash around, tear it to pieces? Why don't you use that thick head|before you wreck everyone's life. - Why didn't you think what you were doing?|- I knew what I was doing. I'll do it when anybody|makes a monkey of me. What do you mean? I saw Mart coming out of your room. You mean you murdered him for that? And you said you've got to know|what you want... ...and go after it tooth and nail. You, who let every mad whim that enters|your brain whip you around. I bet you would even kill me if I made|a move that didn't meet with your approval. I might. Why was Mart out there|on the sand dunes? - What's the difference? He's dead.|- You forget, I'm in this too. Don't think I didn't loathe|perjuring myself to the police. - Why was he out there?|- To meet old lady Kraft, Palmer's pal. - He was gonna get rid of her.|- That was your idea? Why not? She put a detective on me. And if you'd killed her,|what about the detective? - I'd have figured something out.|- You and your great brain. You would have figured out something|that would have messed things up, I'm sure. - Where can I find Mrs. Kraft?|- Why? Why do you suppose?|To patch up your bungling. - I'm so grateful to have such a clever friend.|- I can do better than you. And I won't need any knives|or blunt instruments, either. Yes? I'm Helen Brent. When I called from|downstairs, you said you remembered me. Oh, yes. - You look ill.|- I didn't sleep so good last night. - They're pals of yours.|- Who? Those two butchers that tried|to murder me. It says that one of them is married|to your sister. Now, Mrs. Kraft, Mr. Wild didn't try|to murder you. Maybe not. But the other one did. He thought he had me, too,|but he was wrong. He said I'd lived long enough,|but the joke's on him. He's the one that's dead.|Me, I'm alive and hollering. Hand me that beer, will you? It was Mr. Wild who saved your life,|now, wasn't it? But he killed Laury. - What makes you think that?|- He's the one, all right. I know. As soon as I get my clothes on,|I'm going to the police. If you go to the police, you'll see Laury|sooner than you think. - Are you trying to scare me?|- I'm just warning you. Perhaps you don't realize.|It's painful being killed. A piece of metal|sliding into your body... ...finding its way into your heart. Or a bullet|tearing your skin, crashing into a bone. It takes a while to die, too.|Sometimes a long while. - But I won't die!|- I tell you, you will. I'm so tired. Can't you leave me alone? Does it matter very much|if this man isn't caught? You're the coldest iceberg of a woman|I ever saw, and the rottenest inside. I've seen plenty, too. I wouldn't trade places with you|if they sliced me into little pieces. Do you want to live or die? Laury, Laury, I've failed you. You understand that if Sam Wild is turned|over to the police for any reason... ...your life is over. Yes. - Goodbye.|- Wait. I'd be a bad hostess|if I didn't see you out. Bad cess to me? No need for me to say it.|You carry your own curse inside of you. - Sam. Sam, where are you going?|- Out. I've been waiting all day|for a chance to talk to you. I saw Mrs. Kraft. It was pretty awful. You needn't worry|about her anymore. Fred will be here soon. I'll get money|from him to keep Arnett quiet. What are you knocking yourself out for? Lying to the police, shutting up Kraft,|hitting Grover for dough? - Those aren't things Helen Brent stoops to.|- Well, none of them is very pleasant. Then what are you doing them for? - Oh, Sam.|- Well, why are you? I'd like to know. For Georgia's sake. All right, then. For my sake. For ours.|Now are you satisfied? I didn't like doing them.|I hated doing them. And I hate you for forcing me|to do them. I'm not forcing you to do a thing. I know. Sam. Come back by midnight.|I'll be waiting for you. You want me to come back|knowing what you know, don't you? All right. See you at midnight. Sam, you're carrying a gun. Sure. Can't tell when I might need one. Can't tell when I might|suddenly turn into a suspect. Just a moment, please. There's a Mr. Arnett on the telephone,|Mrs. Brent, and Mr. Grover's here. Oh, tell Mr. Arnett I'm not in.|To call back later. They were such good friends.|Sam's really taking it very well, though. - Hello, darling. Georgie.|- Hello. Well, I've got some things to take care of.|See you later. Right. - Pretty awful, that Mart business.|- Yes, wasn't it? - I asked you not to have him in this house.|- I know you did, and you were right. - I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you.|- Well, that's water under the bridge now. - Helen, I have something that...|- Darling, I want to... - Go ahead.|- No, mine can wait. What were you going to say? I've been thinking about things. I feel that our getting married|would be a mistake. You mean you're no longer|in love with me? I wish I weren't. - Fred, what's this all about?|- The point is, Helen, you don't love me. I suspect I've known a long time,|but I've shied away from it. What I say doesn't matter? What you say and what you feel|are completely different. Since I've known you, you've become|lovelier, more mentally assured... ...but it also seems to me that when|I first knew you, you had a heart. I don't think you have anymore. I'm just an iceberg of a woman,|is that it? You'll be pleased to know|you're not the first to say that. I didn't know that anyone else could see|under that shining surface of yours. Why can't you, Helen,|before it's too late? Too late? What an ominous|choice of words. Too late for what, pray? You told me once that you'd always land|on your feet, no matter what happened. - You won't always, Helen.|- How dare you say these things to me. Who are you to be so smug|and holier-than-thou? - I didn't mean it to sound that way.|- Are you so perfect you can sneer at me? I'm sorry we had to end this way. Fred! Fred! Fred, don't go. Don't. If you leave me, I haven't a chance.|Stay and help me. The person who said I was cold|also said I was rotten inside. Well, part of me is, but I'm not... I'm not clear through. Not yet, Fred. I'll fight it. I'll fight it off, and I'll be all right|if you'll help me. - I'm afraid I can't help you.|- Fred, please. - Lf I felt I could, but...|- I need you. I need you terribly. You saw enough good in me|to fall in love with me. - It's still there.|- I doubt it, Helen. You've changed so. Particularly since Sam came|into this house. Why would Sam have any effect on me? I don't know. Why would he? I see now. Sam's the reason you feel as you do. You never see a thing|except what you want to see, do you? Sam. Sam! Mrs. Brent, Mr. Arnett's on the phone again.|Do you want to talk to him now? Yes, I do. - Hello.|- Hello, Mrs. Brent. Through some strange circumstance, my|client has decided to abandon her search. Now, I have a glimmering as to what may|have caused this abrupt change of heart... ...but don't make the mistake of thinking|that I can be that easily swayed. Nothing is going to save your Mr. Wild|except the sum I quoted you. - Fifteen thousand dollars, and at once.|- You're not going to get it from me, Arnett. The gentleman in question has cost me|much too much already. I hope you realize that I am not bluffing. The police will be there one hour|after this conversation. It can't be too soon|to get him out of my life. He'll be back in the house about midnight.|And I might warn you, he's armed. Do you remember the verse|from the Bible, Mrs. Brent? I find more bitter than death... ...the woman whose heart|is snares and nets. And he who falls beneath her spell... ...has need of God's mercy. Where's Fred? He's gone. For good. For good? Oh, Helen, I'm so sorry. - Would you like to tell me about it?|- No. Perhaps going away for a bit|would be good. We could take a trip to Florida,|just you and Sam and I... ...and we could have...|- Georgia. I have to talk to you about Sam. He doesn't really mean|too much to you, does he? Why, Helen, what in the world? Georgia... ...Sam's going to be arrested. - What?|- He killed Mart. He killed those people I found in Reno. Oh, really, Helen. Sam killed Mart?|Sam killed some people in Reno? - I tell you, it's so.|- Lf this is some kind of a joke... Look, we haven't much time.|The police will be here at midnight. I want you to be prepared. I don't believe it. There's proof, Georgia. There are fingerprints in Reno. We'll get the best lawyer|in town for him. No matter how it comes out,|you and I will go away. - You'll be all right. Where are you going?|- To put his things together. - He's got to get out of here.|- No. It would be worse if he tried to get away.|The police may have men around the house. But we've got to do something.|When Sam gets here... You go to your room. You're upset.|He'll know something's wrong. You think I'll let my own husband|walk into a trap? Georgia, Sam's a murderer. A maniac. How can you stand the thought of even|looking at him again? I don't know how, but I... Oh, Helen, I still can't believe he did this. Of course you can't.|I realize it's been a terrific jolt... ...and you've never had to take any jolts.|Your money has always protected you. - What's my money got to do with this?|- Nothing, of course. You called the police. - I had to...|- How long have you known? - A few days, I guess.|- And you just made up your mind tonight... ...to call the police.|- What are you...? Fred was through with you, wasn't he?|You were willing to let my money go... ...when you had Fred's. But he walked out.|- Ridiculous. You realized you weren't going to get|his money or mine. You're right. You're not. Georgia, listen. Whatever else I've done,|I've loved you. You love my money.|That's all you hung around for. - Be quiet.|- Well, I'll tell you this much. You won't get a nickel as long|as I live. When I die, you still won't. - I'll see to that in the morning.|- Stop. - You're washed-up as far as I'm concerned.|- Little fool. You're crazy. If I am, at least I'm crazy|with love for a man. You're crazy about money and yourself. Mad about a man|who doesn't give a damn for you. You think you can get back at me like that,|by telling me Sam doesn't love me? I'll show you how much he loves you. Stay there and listen. Sam. Sam. - Things are piling up on us.|- What happened? I'm afraid for you. - Let's go away together, you and I.|- Yes. - Tonight. Right now.|- Yeah. Get out of here. Both of you, get out. She'd never let us be happy|while she's alive. - Get out, I said.|- Do you hear me? She doesn't want us to go away.|We can never be together till she's dead. Yes, I think you're right. I loved you so, Sam, that I would|have saved you no matter what. Maybe Helen was right in calling the police.|I don't know anything anymore. Open up. This is the police. You called the police. - You.|- Why would I call the police, Sam? - I don't know why, but you did.|- You don't believe Georgia about that? - Yes, I think I do.|- Open up. Open up in there. - We'll have to let them in.|- Don't go near that door. No, Sam! Come on out of there!|It's me, Sam, remember? Tonight's our night. We have time|for a few kisses before the police get me. You'd love that, wouldn't you? You're|crazy about me, don't you remember? Sam, you're out of your head.|I should have known that long ago. - Please be reasonable.|- Come on out, my darling. Sam! Sam! Mrs. Brent. - In there.|- Sure. - Send for an ambulance.|- Okay. Won't do this guy any good, though. You should never have stayed in the house.|It was taking too big a chance. Yes. - I did take too big a chance.|- Well, I wouldn't worry. - Everything will be all right.|- No. No, it won't. Fred was right. This time, I didn't land on my feet. The way of the transgressor is hard. More's the pity. More's the pity.
