Now we have a chance. Run. That's not going to slow them down for long. That's not gonna slow them down at all. What are you waiting for? Hurry. It's time to get serious, Lex. No. We can make it together. We can do this. Get your shiny bald head out of here. It's hurting my eyes. What can I say? Okay, okay. I'm down to my Last Joke, anyway. But this one will kill you. It won't be in vain, old friend. ULTRAMAN: Luthor. You think you can hide from my ultra-vision? You're gonna pay for what you've done, mate. -That's a promise. -I've gotta a promise of my own. I'm going to finish the Job the Jester started. But not Just yet. J u s t i c e L e a g u e The work would go a lot faster if l were up there with you, guys. Patience. I'm almost ready for you. How much is all this costing, Bruce? I don't like to think about it. All right, Flash. Beginning test run. l don't know, Batman. This is pretty radical. You're absolutely sure it works? Pretty sure. Pretty sure? That isn't-- --good enough. TeIeporter's online. Are you crazy? Is he crazy? How could he use that thing on me if he wasn't sure? -He was Joking. -Yeah, how can you tell? You really think he would risk your life if he wasn't sure? Well, maybe. I mean, I don't think he likes me very much. I don't think he likes anyone very much. Good morning. Would you be kind enough to tell me where I could find the nearest police station? Excuse me, it's very important that I-- Yeah, yeah. Cool your Jets. This is a police station. Everything's important he-- Luthor. No need to make a scene. I want you to contact the Justice League for me. Or else? Oh, I don't know. I'll destroy the world? Is that sufficient? Superman. Go ahead. BATMAN: We've got a problem. One of yours. It's okay. We'll take it from here. Oh, and they call me The Flash. -What do you think you're doing? -I've come to talk. As you can see, I'm not armed. You're going to find what I have to say very difficult to believe. You're from a parallel Earth. How could you possibly know that? Your internal organs are reversed, your heart is on the wrong side. It could be a trick. Could be. But our Luthor's still in his cell on Stryker's Island. And now that we've clarified the matter of my evil twin... ...I've got quite a story to tell you. Pants. Oh. My world is similar to yours in many ways but very different in others. Oh, wait, wait, don't tell me. On your world, you're the leader of the Justice League. As a matter of fact, I was. Past tense. I'm not Just the Leader of my world's Justice League. I'm its only surviving member. We were systematically destroyed by a group of superpowered beings... ...known as the Crime Syndicate. They've run rampant for years, doing whatever they pleased. They rule through fear... ...occasionally turning their powers against the populace, Just to remind us. In the hope of maintaining some minimal order... ...the authorities simply pretend they aren't there. But increasingly, they refuse to be ignored. The Syndicate has completely intimidated civil authority. The police won't arrest them... ...and prosecutors wouldn't press charges if they did. The only thing keeping them from completely overthrowing the government... ...is the threat of a nuclear response. You people are my world's last hope. We have to discuss this. Please wait out here. -I don't trust him. -There's a surprise. Maybe he's on the up and up. You said yourself, he's not our Luthor. Still, never met a Luthor I liked. I've read his mind, he's telling the truth. Regardless, we have a responsibility... ...to the millions of people being oppressed on his world. For all my power, when it comes down to it, I'm a beat cop. There are rules. Another dimension may be out of our Jurisdiction. I can't believe we're having this discussion. Of course we're going to help. She's right. That's what we do. -Not this time. -Why not? We've got too much on our plate right here. We haven't even finished constructing our new headquarters. Our first responsibility is to protect the Earth. That's right. Our Earth. We don't have enough manpower to even do that properly. Fair enough. But we're talking about millions of people. We can't Just turn our backs. We have to go. All right, Luthor, we'll help. But we need a plan. I have one, of course. What's so fascinating? Luthor has solved the decoherence problem. Darling, unless there's money involved, you're still boring me. Parallel Earths. Luthor is not only proven they exist... ...he's figured out how to travel between them. Any sign of the quantum trigger? We've searched the entire complex. If it was here, it's not now. Right. Download all these records into my personal computer. The rest of you, strip this place of anything useful, then destroy it. This could be disorienting, but there are no other side effects that-- What the hell? We're compromised. What tipped you off? I don't have time for this. I need that data. Take them down. That will be enough of that. -That's what I call tuning somebody up. WOMAN: Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a minute? Hera. I've played this game before. You don't wanna fight me. You wanna help me. I don't wanna fight you, I want.... Hey, this is like the Jedi mind trick. This is not like the Jedi mind trick. This is not like the Jedi mind trick. Sorry. J'ONN J'ONZZ: Stop that. We've got to retreat. Why? We're winning. Superwoman's called in the cavalry... ...and if it's who I think it is, we're not prepared. Don't make us guess. What are we in for? At least three Made Men, almost as tough as Superwoman. -Made Men? -Later. I don't have time to explain. Follow me. FLASH: Oh, crap. GREEN LANTERN: I've got you. Heads up. More trouble. Get off my plane. Is that one of us in Owlman's plane? Two of us. Wonder Woman swiped it. Then there may be a way out of this. Swing around for me. Stay on top of him. The plane is mine. Where is it? What are you looking for? Chameleon circuit. Owlman used to drive me crazy-- Found it. What's it do? Lantern, we're cloaked right above you. Hold fire, our ride's here. -Hang on. -Whoa! Ooh! Strafe the skies. Well, that's fried. It doesn't matter, we're still cloaked. WONDER WOMAN: And we've lost them. At least for the moment. So, genius, where to now? JOHNNY QUICK: Yeah, handed them a right thumping... -...I heard, let the blinking side down a bit. ULTRAMAN: Come to order. First business. We've gotta decide who we're calling up to replace J'arkus. God rest his soul. There's no managerial talent in that organization. We should dissolve them and spilt up his territory. Right, seems to me you've already helped yourself to the Martian's crew. You had the whole bunch this morning. Made Men need to be associated with one of the family heads... ...if you want some of them. We can horse-trade for manpower any time. -What about the turf? SUPERWOMAN: I'm with Owlman. We'll divide his action between the five of us. Who died and made you boss? You wanna arm wrestle for it? Knock it off. We'll work out details later. For now, Owlman can keep J'edd J'arkus' guys. From what I hear, sounds like you could have used a few dozen more. Luthor's new Justice League is not be underestimated. Neither are we. They'll fold. Or we'll fold them. Just like everybody else who gets in our way. Which brings us to the topic at hand. Last meeting, five of six family heads approved of Project Damocles. Per our vote, I have begun construction on this, the quantum eigenstate device. Once completed, the QED will give us life-and-death power over the entire planet. We spent 37 billion on government bribes last year. No more of that. We'll be the government. I still don't see why they would give up the little bit of power they got left. Because if they don't, we'll do this. The device's Heisenberg uncertainty override... ...allows us to tap into a limitless pool of destructive energy. Which leaves the governments of the world with two choices: Bow down to us or die. ROSE: The thing to remember... ...is we don't have to be afraid of the Crime Syndicate. REPORTER: If that's true, why do you have bodyguards? Come on, my father's the president. I had guards before I started speaking out. Isn't it irresponsible of you to be out here making speeches... ...in direct contradiction of your father's policies? I love my father, but we disagree about this, and I have the right to free speech. If we leave the Syndicate be, they'll Let us live our lives. -We don't have the power to fight them. -No. Might doesn't make right. It may seem that way, but in the long run... ...it's the other way around. We are always stronger when we're doing the right thing. LEX: Lights. I love what you've done with the place. LEX: It's not mine. It used to belong to a friend. I'm sorry, Harley. The Jester's never coming back. We should consider ourselves lucky there's any place left to hide. We're not here to hide, Luthor. We're here to clean up your planet's mess. Then by all means, let's get started. And call me Lex. These are the big guns, the heads of the six. I should say, five families. Ultraman is the boss of bosses, but they all front formidable organizations. Where do all those superpowered guys fit in? LEX: Each of the family heads... ...have thousands of criminals working under them. They reward their most trusted lieutenants by giving them superpowers. They're called Made Men. Cute. How many? LEX: No more than seven or eight at a time. Perhaps 50, total. We'll conduct a series of attacks, coordinated by me. The six of us will hit specific Syndicate operations... ...one after the other. -That's a waste of time. -I beg your pardon? We're going to hit multiple targets at the same time. Teams of two. We'd be hopelessly outnumbered. -When my Justice League fought them-- -All due respect, Lex. We aren't your Justice League. -What's the call? -You and J'onn. Diana and GL. He's with me. That's insane. -Don't worry, Lex. He's got your slack. -Flash. Well, you do. You're supposed to call first. What's the point of having your keys if I can't drop in unexpectedly? Still Looking for the quantum trigger? Yes, but in the meantime, I've been working on something equally interesting. We can use it to travel to any of the alternate Earths. It's based on Luthor's design. I've made some improvements. Do you realize what we could do with this? The philosophical implications are tremendous, of course. Philosophy. There's an infinite number of Earths out there to conquer. You and me. We wouldn't have to share our cut with the Syndicate. That's certainly one way to go. Whoa! -Right, then. Abandon ship if you can. -Oh! Oh! -I got her. -No. She's mine. Ultraman, I know you can hear me. Bring your arrogant ass out here or we'll come in and get you. Not Looking for the hired help, Olsen. I want your boss. He ain't here. If you want an appointment, you can call his secretary. Clear our airspace. Make me. I can do that. You take care of Ultraman's pal. I got the big guy. I'd rather not have to hurt you, Jimmy. You sure you want to do this? I can take him. If it's going to mean anything after you're gone, it has to be me. Get your hands off my boy. You've got problems of your own. Getting cocky, Lex? You think you can come to my place of business and call me out? Ooh! Did you forget who I am? How I got to be the boss of bosses? I'm here because I'm the baddest of the bad. Anybody whoever stood in my way is dead. Everybody. I brought you a present. [WEAKLY] Blue kryptonite. The only thing that can hurt you. But I-- Destroyed the last piece on Earth? True. But I've been visiting other Earths. You are so gonna regret this. Got a message for you, big man. Things are changing. When you do wrong... ...there are more and more of us who aren't afraid to set it right. United States Secret Service. The president would like a word with you. WILSON: This is unacceptable, Lex. -What do you think you're doing? LEX: That should be obvious, Mr. President. We're taking it to the bad guys, sir. Well, you should be very proud. Have you given the slightest thought to the consequences of your actions? Don't talk to me like a child. I was fighting this battle long before your administration... ...decided to roll over for the Syndicate. We didn't roll over. We've worked to achieve a delicate balance with the Crime Syndicate. It's the only way the American people can live in relative safety. Forgive me, Mr. President, but that's a load of crap. Be that as it may, I've already ordered the release of Ultraman. You did what? You wanna watch your tone? I'm sorry, Mr. President. I Just don't understand how you could Let them go free. You clearly don't understand much of anything. Do you think anybody would testify against the Crime Syndicate? Do you think if anybody were willing, we could keep them alive until trial? -We can. -Oh? Are you going to protect their families too? Are you going to stay here and watch over us forever? Obviously not. But we can stop them right now. Put an end to their hold over you. Kill them? No. We don't do that. WILSON: Then I've got a better idea. Why don't you go home and end all crime on your own planet? Why don't you grow a backbone. Not now, Rose. Then when, Dad? We've got a chance. That's a fantasy. We can't fight these guys without risking the lives of millions. ROSE: My God, Dad. You were a war hero. When did you turn into a coward? J'ONN J'ONZZ: He is not a coward. Men who have seen battle... ...are often among those who hold life most dear. -How did you know what I was thinking? -It was an accident. I didn't mean to read your mind. There's a saying on my world: ''The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.'' It's easy for someone like you to be brave. But most of us aren't bulletproof. Sir, I stand up to guys more powerful than I am all the time. You can do the same. That simple, huh? I'm sorry, Mr. President, but we're not about to give up this fight. Not when we finally have a chance to win it. -Aren't you supposed to be helping? -I am helping. I'm improving the ambiance. In a way, that's what I'm planning to do. After all, what good is a bomb if you don't detonate it? You never had any intention of using the QED for bIackmall. You're going to use it to kill everybody. What if I am? Just tell me. Why? Why not? I'm serious. I'm a murdering psychopath. It's part of my charm. I do find it attractive. But you never make a move without a reason. Why would you want to destroy the world? Because it's the only action one could take that would have any purpose. You Lost me there. Every decision we make is meaningless... ...because somewhere, on a parallel Earth, we have already made the opposite choice. We're nothing. Less than nothing. How can you say that? We're rich. We're conquerors. And here we're poor. We're slaves. And here, our parents never met, so we were never born. Here, the world ended in nuclear war. Here, no fish was ever brave enough to crawl up on land... ...and humans never evolved. And so on, ad infinitum. So even if you destroy the world, there are a billion others, right? What difference would it make? Somewhere in the multiverse, there is a world I call Earth Prime. Every Earth is a variation of this one, the original. And once I destroy it, all reality will follow. I take it back. You're much crazier than I am. Don't get in my way. To the contrary. I'm in. I thought I might find you here. -I'm not talking to you. -Then listen. You're going to have to stop speaking out against the Syndicate. At Least in public. You know, when I was a little girl, you were my hero. What's happened to you? Maybe we both grew up. ULTRAMAN: Kids, huh? They drive us crazy, but we'd still do anything to protect them. Am I right? What do you want? Saw your daughter on the news the other night. -She's got a mouth on her. -It's a free country. We both know better than that. You get your little girl under control, or I'll do it for you. Remember what happened to the First Lady. If you come near my daughter, I will nuke you. You hear me? ULTRAMAN: Yeah, the nukes. -Great equalizer, huh? -Uhn! Well, Let me tell you something, Mr. President. My boys are working up a bomb of our own. Nice place. I think I'm gonna like it here. I'm getting bored again. Did you find Earth Prime? Still Looking. But I found something else. Luthor took the quantum trigger to a parallel Earth. Would you be a dear... ...pop over to the universe next door and pick it up for me? COMPUTER VOICE: Perimeter breach. Potential intruder alert. Perimeter breach. Potential intruder alert. It's here. Spread out and find it. You're on my property. Stand down. You're in over your head. Back off before I come over there and hurt you. Insect. Stay down. You're outnumbered. Count again. You guys are in trouble. Take them. Careful, Aquaman. They're stronger than you are. That remains to be seen. Okay, this is gonna be tougher than I thought. Wanna hear a secret? You've got possibilities, little man. But, sadly, I don't have time to play with you. Let's go. -Take this to Owlman. -Yes, mistress. What about him? Oh, I'm sure I'll think of something. ROSE: We're all here for the same reason. We're tired. Tired of living in fear. Tired of our elected officials bending over for vicious criminals. It doesn't have to be that way. Joining me today are elected officials who aren't afraid to act. Judges, prosecutors, police officers... ...and brave people like each and every one of you. Together we can win. Together we-- Excuse me. No. Stay away from me. How Long have you been watching me? My apologies for the deception. I doubt this will be the Last attempt. With your permission, I'll continue to keep close watch on you... ...until the immediate crisis has passed. That would be Just fine. Nice moves. You remind me of my boyfriend. Whatever will I do with you? I could use this to send you away. Perhaps to here... ...an Earth where humanity has mutated into hideous creatures of the night. No. You might like that. Oh. Here's a good one. A cold, uninhabited Earth, where you'll slowly starve to death... ...if you don't freeze first. Or it might be fun to keep you as a pet. Here. Let me do that. -Your call. -Sorry. You're not my type. That's going to cost you a rib. Aah! Ow! I like my lovers to make a little noise. What else can I break? You think you can hide from me with a smoke bomb? BATMAN: It's not smoke. It's anesthetic gas. Batman to Justice League. Aah. You sure that will hold her? -What did you hide on my satellite? -I don't know what you're talking about. What was so valuable that the Crime Syndicate... ...would cross dimensions to get it? -Did you keep it from her? -Her henchman escaped with it. Whatever it was. It's the quantum trigger, the detonator for a bomb they're building. Without it, we could fight them, but now-- Why didn't you Just destroy it? It's pure energy. It can't be destroyed. Okay. They've got it. What's the worst-case scenario? LEX: They could use it to set off an explosion that would wipe out the entire Earth. You think too small. Where's Superwoman? Probably Just blowing us off. Like I should have. We're not waiting anymore. Let's get started. People aren't as intimidated as they used to be. I should go down for a Jog and terrorize the straights. Even regular law enforcement's starting to show some backbone. Archer got himself arrested. Public opinion wouldn't be an issue if the bomb were ready. The QED is nearly complete. I have agents out gathering some equipment. Sorry, sorry to come in without permission... ...but Superwoman said to bring this right to you. You don't have to wear that disguise. No one can see in here. I thought it would make you more comfortable. Just the opposite. I'd like to get to know the real you. That's better. -Are you really from Mars? -Yes. And can all Martians read minds? Could. I am the Last survivor. I apologize for reading your mind before. It is considered extremely impolite to do so without permission. I didn't mind. It seemed, I don't know, natural. We are attuned. Our minds are in sync to a degree that was rare even among my own people. I never imagined I'd meet a human so complimentary to myself. I feel it, attuned. What are you doing? Trying to kiss you. On Earth, it's a way of sharing affection. This is how we do it on Mars. Know me. That was.... Wow. Now we know each other. All the battles the Justice League have won. You think you can beat the Crime Syndicate? If we could find them, I have little doubt. I could find out where their base is. My father's known for years. You wanna give us a hand here? Final calculations. Very delicate. FLASH: Are we there yet? That wasn't funny the first 15 times you said it, either. Enjoy yourselves while you can. -My friends are going to tear you apart. -Told you we should have Left her. We couldn't take the chance she'd escape and warn them we're coming. When I get loose, I'm killing you right after Batman. Uhn! Doesn't mean we have to listen to her, though. How are we supposed to get in again? Multi-frequency band, encryption analyzer-replicator pack. Some of us don't speak Star Trek. Think of it as a fancy garage-door opener. Come on, then. Pitch in, you miserable git. JOHNNY QUICK: Having a kip, are we? I'm talking to you. The hangar doors Just opened. Is it Just me, or does this seem a little too easy? We were Just about to come Looking for you. The QED is armed now. You'll want to surrender. ULTRAMAN: You heard him. We've got the bomb. Everybody does what we say, or else. You're bluffing. As Long as the bomb's here, all you can blow up is your own house. Maybe you should surrender. We've taken down dozens of you. And now the odds are 6-to-3. SUPERWOMAN: Count again. -Uhn! Uhn! Look who I found in the hangar. Submit. Bugger. No. -What Just happened? -He's taken the QED to Earth Prime. If he detonates it, he'll destroy all reality. -I'm not liking the sound of that. -Don't listen to him. Owlman's Just taking the bomb to a hiding place. Don't try and con me. What are you two doing? LEX: There's no way to follow him. -It's over. -Not yet. How many coordinates does this thing keep in memory? The Last dozen or so, but-- That's more than enough. Owlman's way ahead of us. We're locked out. Unless.... Someone vibrating at the right speed could piggyback... ...on Owlman's carrier wave and open a portal. But he'd have to be fast. -I'm your man. -No, you're not. You're too slow. -What? -I know your limitations. You can't possibly reach the speed necessary to pull this off. -But I can. -Listen. -I-- -No, you listen. He's talking about my world. I'm not letting that happen. -It could be dangerous-- -The bloody universe is at stake. Of course it's dangerous. All right, when you reach the proper speed, I'll give you a mark. LEX: You have to hold that speed precisely. Got it? Faster. Faster. Hold that speed. I'm next. You don't have a transit device. You'd be torn apart by the event horizon. OWLMAN: Welcome to Earth Prime. Before there was thought, there was this place. One Earth, with a single history. But with the coming of man came the illusion of free will... ...and with that illusion came chaos. With every choice we make, we literally create a world. History branches in two, creating one Earth where we made the choice... ...and a second where we didn't. That's the secret of the universe, you know. Billions of people making billions of choices... ...creating infinite Earths. Some so similar to each other you can spend a lifetime... ...searching for any distinction, others so radically different... ...they defy comprehension. And all of the branches originate here. Every version of reality balances precariously on this singular Earth. It seems so different from the Earths we know. I can't imagine what series of decisions led to this world hurtling out of its orbit. But I know this: The source of the cataclysm was the same as it always is. Man. You can't be sure of that. -Anything-- -You know better. Man is a cancer. And I've chosen to cut out the disease. You're talking about killing-- Everyone who ever lived. Who ever will live. I choose to make the only possible real choice. You're insane. Does it really matter? There are alternate versions of me that you would find quite charming. OWLMAN: From what I gather, we're very much alike. Everything about you tells the tale. Your attitude, your costume, your tactics... ...they all scream of outrage, despair, vengeance. What terrible wrong was done to set you on this path? It doesn't really matter. Nothing matters. What are you planning to do, talk me to death? Actually.... I thought I'd beat you to death. You should have sent your flying man. With his strength, he might have had a chance. But you don't trust anyone else to do what needs to be done. Hah. I feel the same way. If we're really alike, you know this is wrong. You must have been a good man, once. No. Not good. Never good. After all, I'm only human. -Uhn! -No more debate. I'm going to kill you now, then everyone else. There is a difference between you and me. We both looked into the abyss... ...but when it Looked back at us... ...you blinked. It doesn't matter. Are you all right? Johnny, I'm back. Stop vibrating. Stop. Oh, God. Did we save the world, then? We did. And all that rubbish about me being faster than Flash? You knew this was gonna happen. Good one, mate. That's real sad, ain't it? Now, get your asses off my moon. What's wrong with you? We almost Lost everything. That was then. Now you're a bunch of wanna be cops trying to take me in. Going to take you in. Two things: You ain't got the authority and you ain't nearly tough enough. We're more than tough enough. Brought the cavalry? I brought the Marines. The president was displeased by the attempt on his daughter's life. There are nuclear weapons in the shuttle. I brought enough for everybody. WILSON: There's no way to thank you. You've given us back our world. I've already ordered the national guard to support local Law-enforcement teams. We're rounding up the bad guys everywhere. I don't want you to go. I don't want to go either, but I don't belong here. You could. You could belong here with me. Excuse me, J'onn, but would you stop acting like an idiot? -What? -This is what we fight for. If you love her, stay. I've already Lost one home. I made a promise to protect my new one. Then this is how we say goodbye. Maybe there's another one like her back on our Earth. With my luck, she'll be evil. Ah. It's good to be back home. -Ow! -Mind your head. FLASH: I can't believe you kept that thing. Spolls of war. I like it. What do you need a plane for, anyway? You can fly. You drive a car. That is so not the point. I owe you an apology about this mission. You were right. We were both right. Still, more help around here wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm glad you agree. I've been thinking about a membership drive.
