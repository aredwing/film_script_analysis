Number 4-- I do solemnly swear-- I do solemnly swear-- that I will support and defend-- that I will support and defend-- the Constitution of the United States-- the Constitution of the United States-- against all enemies, foreign and domestic. You call yourselves soldiers? You ain't no soldier! You ain't no soldier! Aim! Shoot! Hell no, we won't go! Hell no, we won't go! The allied offensive in northern Iran could be the turning point in the war. That, according to the Pentagon where a spokesman says-- Can you make these changes for me? Sure. Twelfth and Broadway. I'm in a hurry. "This is worse than Vietnam." Those words from Joey Silver, draft eligible, currently working on Wall Street. Polls in the U. S. show seven out of ten Americans oppose any move to dig deeper into the draft ranks. The decision last month to up the acceptable draft age to 35, has triggered a tidal wave of protest. Opposition now spreading from college co-eds to corporate offices. Opponents are-- --earlier this week Officers scoffed in Baghdad, killed more than 120. Caldwell acknowledged things have not gone to plan. If you look throughout what's occurring in the city, I know the question asked is, "Are these efforts enough?" Dixon. I'm home, Ma. So when are you moving into the office? And be stuck in this hole with you? It's not for me, Gussie. But thank you, I'm flattered. Don't be flattered. You're the only other person that speaks English around here. Yeah, I think something on the order of 25, 000 more troops probably would be necessary to do what I think we need to do in the country to establish security. Security is really the essential element here. It is very hard for Americans to think about this... So now you just leave? Just leave. That's it. You just go. It says I got 30 days. I can't believe this. It's got nothing to do with me. I mean, listen to this. "Our nation has embarked upon a great quest. "It's up to us to light the path ahead and make the world a freer and safer place for all." Is that what we're doing?! Babe, is that what we're doing? Is it? I mean-- God, I had a very specific plan for us! Thanks for your call. I haven't decided. Hey, pal. How are you? Alright, yourself? Thanks. I'm right in the middle of my book. I'm not gonna be done in time. It's our turn, guys. Hey. It's only fair. You wanna go? I gotta tell ya, after 9/11 doing the goddamn building, for chrissake, In LA? Yeah, Yeah! you're goddamn right I do. The fucked up thing is we don't have a choice anyways. Right. To freedom. A toast? That's right. Get your fucking glass. Come on, boys. To freedom. Tequila. Oh boy. Hey, I know you. From the street. Yesterday. Yeah. I'm sorry. James. Hi, James. Patricia. Very nice to meet you. And you. What brings you down here? Just here with a couple of girlfriends, having a drink. Okay. Well, you guys have a good time. Thanks. You too. Have a great time. Nice to meet you. Yeah, nice to meet you. What the fuck was that? I see her sometimes after the shift. You blew that! I'll see her again. Have a good time? That was so lame. I mean, the weakest attempt ever. She came up to you. Did you see that? Unbelievable. You're buying a second round too now, jarhead. Horribly, horribly wrong. To this day, it's the only fight I ever had. My glasses broke. I was swinging everywhere. Just swinging. I couldn't see a thing. I'm not much of a fighter to begin with. Shocker. I just don't think I could pull the trigger. Not if I could see the person. Not if I could look into their eyes. Well, warfare today isn't really so much about hand to hand combat. I'm just saying. I've got a lot of things to do. I gotta notify people-- a lot of stuff. A lot of stuff. Hm. Well. My publisher is waiting for my book. They paid me a hell of a lot of money, I mean. I'm sure they'll understand. Well, what if they don't? Huh? What about that? You'll be fine, Aaron. Really? Have you seen Mara? Just gettin' in. She ain't at your place again, is she? Said I'm just comin' in. If she's up there, send her home. She's not your kid. Don't you get Cosmo, or Vogue, or anything? Trouble in River City? Same poop. Different day. Wanna go eat something? Sure. Here. Want a hot dog, hot dog? Yup. What do you think about this war? Mom says we're killing innocent people. When she's lucid. Dad says, "Nuke them all." Well, what do you think? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Isn't it time you had opinions of your own? I think this hot dog sucks. That's a start. You don't have to go if you're deemed unacceptable for military service. Hey, Molly? What's unacceptable? If you're declared medically unfit or impaired in some way. Or if you're gay you don't have to go either, did you know that? All I gotta do is fabricate a gay background. I could be gay. You're not gay. No, but they don't know that. You make a good case, you win. That's how everything works. You could also go to jail for lying. Only if they catch me. Honey, I could be blind. That'd probably do the trick. There's nothing there. It's completely arbitrary. It's a lottery. There's no due process there. I have worked way too hard for what we have. And I will not let them take that away. Helicopters probe the skies of Washington DC, and have increased scrutiny of dams, ports, borders, power plants. New York City has its own massive effort called Operation Atlas, which includes monitoring for chemical, biological, or nuclear agents. Restricted airspace above the city-- What's up, buddy? Hey, Dixon. I need your help. I am fucked! I am fucking fucked! So fucked! Look! I'm like fat and skinny at the same time. That's barely possible. I knew I should've been working out all these years. Thigh Master. Soloflex. That Abdominizer. That fucking skiing machine thing. Bowflex. How do these people live? Take that off. Huh? The 25 at the end, take it off. You alright? Yeah, it's fine. You sit down over there, relax. Oh, Dixon, please help me. Here you go, Dad. My Dad. One of the youngest pilots in the Air Force. Ever. Your grandmother always said he couldn't wait to go. His 18th birthday he went down and signed up. Everybody knew it was the right thing to do, but-- that was a different time. A different war. This is a decision you're gonna have to live with-- the rest of your life. This goes to the core of a man and nobody, not a father, nobody, can tell him what to do. Can you get me out of it? I'll try. I'll talk to Senator Boone. It's a strange political climate right now. I know, Dad. I'll--I'll try. Aw, get outta here. Excuse me! Excuse me, young lady! You know how to get to Broadway? I can't find my way. You again. Broadway is that way. Yeah? Hey, let me take you where you're going. That's alright. I'm okay. Thank you. No, I got a special deal today for girls with backpacks. It's half offanywhere you wanna go. Really? Thank you, I'm okay, though. We got a small problem, you know. I ain't gonna move till you get in the car. Come on, what do you say? Move! You kidding! Buddy, move it! Now you're talking. Alright, but only because of that deal. I promise you you got the deal. And you know you're gonna ride in style, comfort and grace. In the front? Ever been in the front seat? Can't say that I have. Where you headed? My parole hearing. Parole hearing, huh? You're funny. About halfway down the street, by the school. Oh, you like kids. So, thanks for the ride. Yeah. Alright. Alright. Hey, good luck with those kids. Thanks. They're easy. Yeah? Okay. Thanks for picking me up. You're welcome. You have a good one. Take care. Bye. Bye. I'll tell you what. "Insert C7 into D7 and assembly is complete." Hey. Hey. I love you. I know. I'm not going. What the fuck you talkin' about? Seriously. How? I just made partner. It's not a good time. I'm just a cab driver, so--. It's not about you. Bullshit it's not about me. You guys go if you want. Okay? That's your decision. How do you not go? You live in that big apartment, you enjoy all this but when it comes time to fight-- I earned all this. When it comes time to be a man, you feel you shouldn't have to go. I'd be the first one out there if we were defending ourselves. Exactly what we're doing. We're invading other countries! Don't you get that? Don't you all get it? What? Look, I don't want to die, man. Not for this. You think we'll die? Maybe you'll die. So what? The draft is for a reason. Nobody wants to go. They'd be there already. That's the whole point. Thinking for yourself, for once. That what you did? What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Molly asked you not to go? Don't go there. You really think we'll die over there? You're goin'. Guys. Hey. It's okay. Hey, look at me. Stop it, please. It's okay. Molly. Congratulations. Five years. The survival rate for this type of cancer goes up to over 98% from this point on. I'm sure you're relieved. Thank you. Take care, dear. You too. Excuse me, didn't you write a book? Uh, yeah. I thought so. Hey. What? No wine, flowers, anything for the host? A book. Now I thought maybe you could learn something. Fuck you. Yeah. Hi. How are you? I'm good. Thank you for coming. Aaron's already here. Just grab a snack. I'll grab you a drink. So, anyway we thought-- Do you really think you can expect peace from people who don't know the meaning of the word? That's the point. We have to teach them. All they see is our tanks and our bombs. Let's talk about the war on terror. Yeah, let's. Come on, let's look at the war on terror with these folks. The entire so-called preemption doctrine, come on, that's a complete failure. Planting the seeds of democracy, that's a failure to you? If I got drafted, I just wouldn't go. Really? Killing is wrong, no matter who does it. So is it wrong 1400 people died in LA last year? How about the 3,000 that died in 9/11? I say it is, but that-- You were in a fucking pedicure. How can you really be expected-- Calm down. Slow down. Dixon! I'm sorry, but you think fighting is wrong 'cause you never had to fight for anything in your life. What do you do? You suck his dick once a month? We're leaving. No, no. Good, get the fuck out. Stay. Dixon, get out. Now. I'll get out. She says "Fighting's wrong so we shouldn't go." Yeah, maybe that's her point of view. They live in a fucking ivory tower! Hey! Now that's enough! I said get out! I'm okay. It's okay. Get out of my house. Get out of my house! Get out of my house!! Will you just stop for a second. What? We were best friends at Stuyvesant. Yeah, you were best friends. And I know he was kicked out for fighting. There's something you don't know. I'm listening. Well, in junior year I was having a problem with this group of kids bullying me. One day, they took my money-- and after school, Dixon followed them. Into an alley. And he beat the shit out of them. He put two in the hospital. It was ugly. And he was sent to a juvenile center for two years. Molly, he did that for me. He was defending me. Hey, uh, Patricia, it's, uh, it's me, Dixon, from the cab. Oh, hi. I was wondering if you had any plans for dinner tomorrow night. Maybe, what did you have in mind? I know a kind of a secret spot in Brooklyn. Are you game? You not gonna chop me up and put me in a freezer? No, no. Watch your step. Did you find this place in the guide to New York fine dining? That's the one. It's one of my favorites. Watch your head. Wow. It's beautiful. So what do you do with a Master's in Sociology anyway? Teach. Work with kids. Or research. That's really great. I like it. You have any brothers and sisters? Two brothers. Folks? They live in Minnesota. He still pinches her butt. And you? My mom died when I was 17. I don't even know where my dad is. I'm sorry-- Don't be. No. You don't have to be sorry for me. What are you doing? I'm gonna kiss you. The blasts were caused by a volley of mortar rounds and one car bomb, all detonating within minutes of each other, in Baghdad. The mortars destroyed a bank and collapsed one apartment building. Iraqi emergency forces found some survivors in the blast, working for hours to find anyone still alive in the rubble, and to remove the bodies. The car bomb destroyed a nearby gas station, spraying burning gasoline onto nearby houses, restaurants and stores. Kurrawa is a religiously mixed neighborhood. relatively safe by Baghdad standards and a home to a number of leaders in Iraq's largest Shiite political party. Dr. Elle's office. Can I help you? Yeah, it's Aaron. You should try to wrap--up your affairs, before you go. I know that's important to you. I don't know what to do next. That's my problem now. I don't know where to start. I think it's important for you to keep doing these things you feel you need to do. Being mentally prepared will help you get through this, Aaron. What is a six-letter word for a Latin dance? Mentally prepared? Perhaps you should make a list of all the important things you need to accomplish. And then just do them. A top ten. That's it. A top ten. Salsa. No, it's five. Cha-cha. Didn't know you were coming. That makes two of us. I made a list of all the things I need to do in the next two weeks. My top ten. Before we go. What are you talking about? "Do ten shots of whiskey? " What are you, in junior high? I have "fuck a prostitute" on this, number five. What's wrong with you? Just things I gotta do before we go. I'm still not going. That's cause you're still a pussy. Alright. Fuck you, okay? I'm outta here. Wait. I'll see you later. Let him go. You think I should do them in order? 'Cause I didn't really think about the order. I just sort of wrote them down. May I? Sure. Wanna get out of here? We're not here to talk. Alright? I could fire a tank or launch a bomb or something, but I just don't think I could shoot someone. Not if could, like, look into their eyes. That's very personal. You know? Like being in a tank, or in a plane. It's like the push of a button. Down the barrel of a gun. I don't know. You tired? I'll call you. Uh-huh. Dixon, let me talk to you. What's up, Gus? I want to take you off the schedule. What are you talking about? You need a break. See some family. Go to Hawaii. Do some things. You worried about me, huh? I like that. It's cute, Gus. It really is. You wanna hear something crazy? I met a girl. Really? I did. Yeah. I think I like her. I really do. I don't want to screw it up like I do every single time. She's smart. She's cool. She doesn't take any of my crap. She's, uh, I don't wanna push anything, I don't wanna screw things up. I really want to take it slow. Slow is good. You think? Definitely. Thanks for everything, Mom. It's really great. I drew this for you, Uncle George. Peepshow? Twenty dollar, strip show. Thirty dollar, masturbation. It costs more if I, you know--? Not you, you moron. The girl. Oh, right. Do you want to pull your cock out? Maybe later. I need you to promise me something. You have to promise not to laugh. Absolutely not. No, I'm serious. You have to promise. I promise you that I will not laugh. Fine. Um-- Fine. I'm so embarr-- You're laughing already! I haven't even started! I'm with you. I promise. No laughing. I'm here. I can't believe I'm telling you this. When I was 17, I was a junior in high school. There was this talent show competition. And I was going to sing. Geez, why am I telling you this? Self-sabotage. I was going to sing The Greatest Love of All by Whitney Houston. Yeesh. And I go out on stage, and the spotlight comes up, and the music starts. And I forgot the words. Nothing was retained. Not even The Greatest Love of All. The name of the song. The name of the song. So-- I started to dance. Yeah, yeah. I couldn't sing. Brilliant idea, I'm gonna dance. For a full three and a half minutes, I sashayed around the stage. Finally, the music stops, and the crowd is just silent-- stunned by what has just come before them. And, um, the curtain just sort of slowly closes in front of me and I went backstage I went into a bathroom stall and I cried for three hours. Should I leave? Should I go? I should go, right? Absolutely not. Welcome to my humble abode. This is it, huh? Yeah. Want a beer or something? Yeah. Yeah. You say the troops are moving to seal off the border. We won't cut and run. The White House says it's confident our troops have the means necessary to combat worsening violence. In Iran, officials say Islamic militia forces operating in Azerbaijan, were responsible for storming a school and executing 30 women and children. Most of the victims were beheaded and burnt to death. In Egypt, more than20, 000 people are now reported killed. One million have been forced from their homes, all since rebels rose up against the government three months ago. Allied leaders say current troops are sufficient to maintain peace. This, despite the wave of coordinated suicide bombings this weekend stretching from Onkura to Cairo. Hey, what's up, kid? Patricia, this is Mara. Oh, hi. So nice to meet you finally. You didn't tell me she was so pretty. Yeah, she is. Well, we should head out. Let's go. Nice to meet you finally. Hey, are you alright, kid? Okay, so let's do that. Which one? The, uh, motion to dismiss. You mean, summary in judgment. George, your dad's on line one. Listen, guys, we're gonna need to pick up later. It's due tomorrow. Later. Hey, Dad. George, sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you. No, it's okay. Look, I talked to Senator Boone. I'm sorry, son. You better get ready to go. Your agreement was very specific on the exclusive nature of your arrangement. But he's selling our competitors' equipment. I know that but all we have to do is look at the contract that's in effect now and-- He told me I waived any claim I might have had because he's already selling the stuff. I told it doesn't matter. But how do you know? Because I'm the lawyer. George. Put you boy on a leash here. I pay you guys a lot of money. You do. So shut the fuck up and let me do my job. That's it. Mac! Wait, please! George. Outside. Now. That guy's an idiot. So? I don't have time for his nonsense. You have time for whatever the hell he pays you to have time for. You understand me? Go home. I know you're going through a lot. I know it is tough, George. But go. Get your head straight. And listen to me. When you come back, this will all be here. So don't worry about that. My brother's coming next week. I want you to meet him. I think you'll really like him. Next week, huh? Where were you? Fucking perfect. Hey. Where were you? I was out for a drink, Is that alright? Well, what's wrong? Nothing. Something's wrong. Everything. Go to bed. Come on. Wanna watch some TV. You need to go to bed. Uh-huh. One time. One fucking time. Do it! Fuckin' do it, George! Honey? This is the place. Dixon coming? I didn't call that prick. Two beers! Alright. Here you go, gorgeous. Is this a gay bar? Come on, broaden your horizons, buddy! What are you doing? One beer. Hey. Hey. Come here often? That the best you can do? First time. I forgive you. Thanks. Well, I don't forgive you. What? You like sucking dick. Right? You two riding the Hershey highway. Excuse me? Huh? The sausage pony? Fuck you, buddy! You like that shit, don't you? Pretty convenient, don't you think? Huh? You just drink a little cum and you get to stay here. While I go off and die! Huh? I think all of you pussy-ass cock sucking motherfuckers-- Alright, buddy, come on down. Fuck yourselves all the way to Iraq! Fuck you! Oh my God! No! No! Get the fuck off me! You faggot mother-- Here you go, man. Thanks. What'd you have to go and call him for? How come you don't have a scratch on you? I had like ten guys on me. Sorry for getting you involved. It was my fault. It's nothing. Don't worry about it. Call your wife yet? No. No, man. I can't let her see me like this. Let's go. Fuck you. What's the sausage pony? Yeah, dude. Motherfucker, you. What the fuck is this guy doing? I went skydiving. What's that? Number eight? Number six. It was awesome. I can't see you doing it. I think I'd pay fucking money to see you do it. We should totally do it! Before we go. Right. You guys remember the girl from the bar? When I was a mumblin' stumblin' idiot? Loser. After all that shit we did. She think this is going somewhere? You know, I'll fuck it up somehow. Oh, I thought you already did. Thanks, buddy. She know you're leaving? Yoo hoo! Wait, we're getting on the boat? Let's go. Make the jump. That's it. You said this was gonna be fun. We're gonna have a blast, let's go. It's been a while, huh? So how's work, buddy? Well, I told some client to fuck off. I've done worse. Like? What do you mean, like? What's the worst thing you've ever done? Come on. Yeah, come on. I'm kinda curious about that myself. Look at you, fuck. Are you serious? Yeah. Alright. I'll go if you guys go. Fine. The worse thing I ever did-- was I threatened to kill my father. In high school, he was drinking and I'm coming home with all that shit. My mom worked these shitty fucking jobs sometimes two at a time. She worked all night, and this guy would just blow all our fucking money on liquor, hookers. One time I was 16, I hear him coming up the steps. He's drunk. He fucking stinks. He comes through the door. I just snapped. I said that "If you ever come back, "if you ever try to talk to my mother again, I'll kill you." And the thing was, is that, I meant it. I did. I wanted to kill him. Right then. That was it. Haven't heard from the guy since. I'd be proud if I did that. Come on. I'm a fraud. Sorry, you're what? You're a frog? I plagiarized my book. I was traveling around Malaysia after I got my Masters. I was working at this farm place, hanging out with these guys. Every night, these guys would sit around the fire and tell these stories. It was like the Dark Ages. Really, like all these amazing stories. Well, one night the guy I was working for, told this story about a young boy who went into this volcano to save his sister. It was the most amazing thing I'd ever heard in my life. So, I kinda took it. I mean, I tweaked it and set it in Alaska, but-- That's where I got the idea. You are a fraud. Fuck you guys! I still have to write it! Yes, you did. Did the old man get residuals? Unbelievable. Alright, you now what? It's your turn. Yeah, come on, lawyer boy, cough it up. No. Cough it up. I've never really done anything. Bullshit. Tonight was a new low, don't you think? I'd be lying if I said I didn't agree. Something tells me there's a skeleton in the closet there that's a little bit worse. Alright. Alright. When we leave this boat, this conversation never happened. Okay? Okay. You guys remember Jessica Hendrix? Yeah, Tommy's little sister. She was cute. I don't know if you guys remember, but-- she was really advanced for her age. She always seemed a bit older, right? Well, one day I'm hanging out at Tommy's house. It was me and, uh, four other guys. We wanted to drink some beer and stuff. So we flipped for it and Tommy loses so he's gotta get it but the only place we know where to get it is really far away. So we all pitch in and Tommy leaves. And while we're there, Jessica comes home. And one of the guys starts playing with her, you know, tickling her, and saying stuff, like, "Show us your tits" and I'll show you mine if you show me yours." Playing. Little stuff like that. Flirting. And she played back. And then he lifts up her shirt. Then he lifts up her bra. And then one of the other guys-- got on the floor with them. And took her pants off. And she was kicking him, and she's yelling, but they're holding her mouth so she can't scream. They start yelling to me, " Fuck her, come on, Do it, get down here! Do it! Fuck her!" Don't fuckin' tell me you fuckin' did that. I didn't. I didn't. I swear to God, I didn't. I got up out of there and I ran! I ran away, and-- and I left her there. I left her there with those fuckin' guys. Listen, I'm really sorry. But I feel like I don't have any other choices. My father hasn't come through. I don't know what else to do. They might die over there. I might die over there. Well, we need a little realism. I know. Meantime, officials here in New York, say they are prepared to handle the influx of protesters coming to attend next weekend's anti-war march. NYPD plans to deploy twicethe normal amount of officers to watch over the event. Planners say they expect well more than a million people to attend. The war remains the hotspot area for voters. New poll numbers show that the war was ranked the most important issue by a four to one margin. The economy was a distant second, followed by the cost of education. I got drafted. I got drafted. Okay. When do you leave? I leave on-- I leave on Saturday. That's when I leave. I leave on Saturday. Wait. What? How long have you known about this? Since I met you. Jesus. Oh. How could you not tell me?! What if they don't like me? I bet the first ones to die are the ones that nobody likes. And I feel like I'm one of those guys. How long have you been coming to me? I don't know. Seven years. I guess. After seven years, I think it's time we tried something new. These will help you sleep. You don't need a psychiatrist and just be yourself. Look at me. Hey, baby. Does Alice make you feel all right? What do you want, motherfucker? Uh-- Speak, bitch. Dallas, she said. Fifty bucks, fifteen minutes. Alright. Fifteen. One motherfucking second more, you in another fifty. Come on! Come on. Relax, baby. Alice is gonna make you feel good. Oh, sugar. Thanks. Night, baby. Night. Where you goin', bitch? What? Another fifty, motherfucker. I was only in there for, like, two minutes! Hey! Fucker! Are you okay? Huh? You hurt? Relax, I want you to tell me exactly what happened. Don't lie, don't embellish. Tell me exactly what happened. That's the guy? I don't know. Alright. You ready? What? Just walk by me. Oh! No. No, I'm staying here. Jesus Christ. You wanna wait here? Please. Wait over there. You got a problem, mother--? Let's get something straight. You like that? A deal's a fuckin' deal, asshole. That was so cool! I don't fuckin' need this shit. But you wrecked that guy. I don't fuckin' need this shit. You wrecked that guy! That was-- Listen, man! You fuckin' think I like doin' shit like this? Fuckin' answer me, you think I like this shit? I don't know. Jesus Christ! What the fuck are you doin', man? What the fuck are you doin' with this guy? Man, we are fuckin' leavin' soon. This is what you're doin'? You don't understand. I don't fuckin' understand? Tell me. Man, you take a fuckin' walk. You can't leave me here! You put me in this fuckin' position! Come on! Dixon! Dixon, I'm sorr-- Dixon! Guys, come on, I wanna go home. Hey, buddy. It's us. We're here. Where are you? We're worried. Give us a call. Alright? Probably working on number 10. Yeah, he's a little out of control. A little? Where you at right now? You still not gonna go? It's just this whole thing is so wrong. I just know it. We're making new enemies every day. And it's a war we can't win. Whoa, you don't know that. I don't know it? I believe it. I believe you. I do. I absolutely believe you. But you need to know that I believe it's the right thing to do. I do, man. I think that if we don't do this now, it's gonna be too late. Nothing left to fight for. 'Cause as soon as they can kill us, they will. As soon as they get nukes, that's it, it's over, man. I'm gonna tell you something else. New York City, right here, we're gonna be first. Look, I-- I'm basically a fuck-up. I know that. I do. But I believe-- I believe in this place and all of it. And the thing is, is that, I choose to drive that cab. I--I choose to be your friend. I choose, right now, I am choosing to be in this bar. And that's the point, man. That's--that's what's at stake, that's-- it's choice, it's freedom. It's freedom to be whatever the fuck you wanna be, even if it is a fuck-up. I mean, we're-- we're in a fight, for a way of life. And that's what I believe. Aaron Feller, reporting for duty, sir. You stand up. You stand up and you fight. You fight. Are you with me? Are you with me? Are you with me? Good. Let's take 'em down. Let's take 'em down! I would die for you. I would die for you, sir. I would die for you. Would I die for you? If you're watching this, then I didn't make it. Either that or I did make it to the five-year mark and we can have a good laugh together. I tried, but-- it just wasn't meant to be. I'm okay with that, 'cause I got to know you. You were a part of my life. Baby, I don 't know many people in this world who would've stood beside someone the way you did. You had your whole life ahead of you, and--you didn't leave me for a second.

After that-- The Iraqi police that were on patrol with us, they were stuck in the kill zone. What do we want? Peace! "What do you want?" "Peace!" You know what it is.
