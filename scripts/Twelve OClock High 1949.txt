Thank you for an enjoyable hour and 40 minutes. It was a pleasure. Come back soon. - Where'd you get this? - In an auction at Archbury. I'll take it. It's been knocked around a bit, sir. - I have a fine Staffordshire... - No, I'll take this one. - How much? - Ten shillings. It's not much value... Value? I want you to pack it carefully. Very carefully. As you say, sir. [DISTANT VOICES SINGING] [LOUD RATTLING] [PLANE ENGINE WHIRS] You mustn't go back. Easy with his right leg. It's broken. Easy now. - Hold him. - We've been sitting on him. I can't. I just can't. I wouldn't believe it if I wasn't looking at it. You can see his brain. Step on it, Doc. What'll I do with an arm, sir? - Whose arm? - Ed Campbell's, the gunner's. - What happened to the rest of him? - In a French hospital, I hope. He couldn't have made it home, so I bailed him out. I put the ring in his good hand. The chute opened. That's all right. I'll take care of it. - Sergeant, get me a blanket. - Yes, sir. Come on, I'll give you boys a lift. - Hospital, Mac. - Yes, sir. Mac's had it. Coordinates on a Spitfire in the Channel? I passed them to Air-Sea Rescue, sir. That's it, gentlemen. Thanks a lot. Next crew. - Take this one. - Next crew! Come on, Jesse. - McKesson's crew. - Right. - McKesson coming? - McKesson's dead. I didn't know. I'm sorry. We might as well get this out of the way. Sit down. Where did you first encounter enemy action? - Bishop! - Leave him alone! Leave him alone. What is it, Billy? I don't know, sir. Not all of it. We got hit pretty bad the first pass the FWs made. That was when Mac got it. It took the back of his head right off. Only he didn't pass out. It just made him a crazy man. He was shouting, trying to get the controls from Jesse... ...when I got up there two hours later. The kid was flying with one hand and holding back Mac with the other... ...wiping blood off the windshield so he could see. For two hours. He made a good bombing run too. If he was in trouble, why didn't somebody get Mac out of there? - The intercom was shot. - For two hours? Mac's foot was jammed in the controls. We broke his leg trying to get it out of there. It seemed to hurt Jesse worst of all. He started shaking. I sat on Mac, held him... ...while Jesse brought us in. Give me a copy of that. I'm making a recommendation for a Medal of Honor. - Jesse will be okay. I'll see him. - Thank you, sir. - That's enough for this crew. - That's all, gentlemen. Next crew. Next crew. - Is he in there, Harvey? - Hasn't been in since interrogation. - He looked like the devil. - Who wouldn't, with today? That's for you, Ben. They'll fly down three replacements. That's nice of them. Lose five, get three. Nice gain, not counting battle damage. MAN ON RADIO: This is Germany calling. Lord Haw Haw talking from Berlin. I want to bring a special greeting from the pilots of the Luftwaffe... ...to the American pilots in England, the 8th Air Force. That's all we need. Our submarines checked you very carefully, four groups so far. Too bad about the crew you lost on the way. But know that a U-boat picked up the crew... ...and they're quite safe here. We found them agreeably talkative. But what we want to know: Whoever persuaded you to try this idea of daylight bombing? It must have been the English. They know better than to try it. Losses are a bit heavy, aren 't they? Let's take the 918th Group at Archbury. - That's us! - The hard-luck group. You lost five bombers today, didn 't you? Five out of the one group. Let's see, 21 in a group. At that rate it won 't take very long, will it? Something to think about before your mission tomorrow. Yes, Colonel Keith Davenport, you'll have another one tomorrow. Pleasant dreams, my misguided friends. Why do we listen? It's always the same pitch, "We've already lost the war." On a day like this I could believe him. What was today's count on crews? Five crews didn't make it back, three killed, 11 wounded out of those who did. - A lot of letters to write. - I'm glad I don't have that one. - Did you hear about Lord Haw Haw? - Twice. News moves fast. Don't let a Kraut throw you. He was right, sir, we're alerted for tomorrow. - You're kidding, Ben? - I wish I were, sir. Fine. Four days in a row. We'd better get things together. Alert the crews. I'll see you in Ops in an hour. - This will make you happy. Flak City. - Saint-Nazaire. It's either a feast or a famine. Waiting on this weather... ...and then try to cram a month's bombing into four days. Field order snafued. It says 9000 feet. I'm sure they mean 19,000. I'll check with Savage. Another maximum effort. And the weather? Give us some fog. I wish I could, but the target is C.A.V.U. About 3/10 cloud cover over the Channel. You're no good to me. Tell me if there's any change. How many airplanes left? With the 3 new ones, and working the crews all night, 18. - How many from the others? - Twenty-one apiece. Better camp on Nero's tail. If he says 18, he's giving us everything with wings still on it. - What did the others lose? - Two in the 916th, zero in the others. Our stinking luck. Those flak gunners had the range when we made our run. - What about crews, Doc? - I could give you different answers. I'll get started on route plans. - Coffee? - Not now, thanks. That's your diet. How long since you've had your clothes off? What about crews? You're crew when it comes to being certified. There's the crew availability. About the route and timing. Don't figure on the altitude until it's checked with Pinetree. Yes, sir. Thanks for worrying, only don't. - What about the rest? - That brings us to the two answers. Twenty-eight men want to be excused, three times more than normal. They gave reasons, colds mostly. And most haven't got colds. They haven't gone yellow. They're getting their bellies full. Do I okay them and mark them duty? How much can a man take? What's physical? The rules say a man goes unless he'll endanger his crew. I don't know what that means. Can you tell me this? Do I okay Bishop for tomorrow? He had a tough deal. Jesse's a tough boy. How tough? What happened today must have affected him inside. It had to cost him something. Somebody's gotta give me a policy, some kind of yardstick. Tell me what a maximum effort means. Doc, I wish I knew. I wish I could answer that one. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Yes. Hello, Pinetree. All right. Frank, Keith Davenport. Yeah, I heard it. I didn't call up to talk about Lord Haw Haw. What about that cock-eyed field order that said 9000? What? You're kidding. But the strike photos don't show what the flak is like. Are you gonna be there for a while? I'll be right up. They meant 9000. When I get back I'll give you an answer, Doc. No, no mistake. It's 9000. They've got to try. We haven't hit those subpens. I know, then twist it. Had the same request all day. The wailing wall is just around the corner, Keith. Oh, I don't know. I guess this is it. Sit down. If you don't level about this stuff, they'll drop their bombs here. Look, Frank... It was tough enough at 19,000. It'll be suicide at nine. Whoever dreamed this up ought to have his brain in a jar. - Anything else? - You've been a group commander. You led the first 10 missions. Tell them what it'll be like... Keith. I signed the field order. - Why? I wanna know. - I'll spell it for you. We haven't penetrated the concrete in those subpens. We can't get concentration and accuracy from 19,000. We've got to go in low, get it done in one trip... ...instead of fighting our way there for nothing. Nine thousand feet. When the old man cuts a field order, he's thought about it. There isn't time to take every one of them apart. If I were you, when I got one, I'd go ahead and fly it. I was gonna bring these to you. Had to steal them from the RAF. Hope they're the kind you wanted. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Frank. I won't need them at 9000. It'll be plenty hot. I'd better get back. Stay put. Thought I might run down tomorrow to see you. - How many do you expect to put out? - Eighteen. - Pretty bad luck today? - Not good. One broke through the runway at takeoff. Threw us late. He never made it up. Cost us plenty. I don't know how anybody outguesses that one. No. I'd like to help locate the trouble. What about your formation? I can tell you where the real trouble is, and it isn't formation. - Shoot. - It isn't down in the groups either. It's up here, where a bunch of boys get to be nothing but numbers. Do they know what my boys have been taking? They'll be up all night to get 18 in the air. How much can they take? They fall asleep at briefing. They'll crack! - Take it easy, Keith. - Bomber Command can take it easy! They'll die for you, but they need a chance. A man's chances run out in 15 missions. Somebody's gotta give them a limit. What do you think they're made of? Look, Keith... [INTERCOM BUZZES] - Yes, sir? MAN: Got the reports. Come up, Frank. I'll be there in a minute, sir. Those things are coming. Replacements. Combat limits. But right now the deal is to hang on. You've got to find a way to save yourself a bit. You can't carry all the load. It's too big. Don't worry about me. Worry about the crews, you and the old man. You'd better go on up and see him. - Give him my love. - Lf I do, he'll send you his. He rates you high. Not according to Lord Haw Haw. Good night. Never mind the reasons. You can't make anything else out of it. Five missing, and they'll only put up 18 tomorrow. It gets worse. I've just been talking to Keith. He's low enough about it. Did he tell you what happened? No, he had tomorrow ahead of him. What do you make of it? Hard luck. There's always some outfit picks up a jinx. You don't believe that. Fill yourself a drink. Thanks. Might scare off that bug of yours. I don't believe in hard luck. There's always a reason. What have you got on your mind? Spill it. I'd rather not. Let's have it, with the bark on. You won't like it. I don't. It's the group commander. Keith? It's always the group commander. It's his job, isn't it? That's funny. He's your friend. - I didn't ask you to ask me. - I didn't mean it like that. It's okay. I don't believe it, though. I don't think I do. On paper Keith looked like the best group commander we've had. He's flown every mission. His men are loyal to him. Courage, he works hard. I don't know where to fault him. If he can't cut it, we're in trouble. What happened to change the picture? Nothing. Added this to it, though: He's gonna bust wide open. And he's gonna do it to himself too. Why? Because he's a first-rate guy. Because he's thinking about his boys instead of missions. Over-identification with his men. I think that's what they call it. You won't change it either. I can't buy it, Frank. Not yet, anyway. - Is he still here? - He had tomorrow to get ready for. We'd better find out. If it's true, we're in trouble. Why should the other groups hold together if the 918th can't? Call my car, will you, while I get my pants on? - You want me to go there with you? - You bet I do. It's your idea. We were three minutes late and got most of it here. Deadly three minutes. The idea was to get the groups there simultaneously... ...so that enemy flak couldn't concentrate on one group. We sure were sitting ducks. I figured they didn't want to bring their loads back. No man makes a perfect plan. You couldn't foresee a plane breaking through. You should've gone to the secondary target. We could have caught up, if it wasn't for stinking luck. Luck? What luck was that? - It was my fault. - It wasn't. I'd like to hear his version. We had to alter the navigation in flight to cross the enemy coast here. We picked up a wind change. And I missed a checkpoint here, Saint-L. By the time I caught it, it had cost us three minutes. We never made it up. If there's any fault, it's mine. I ordered the change in flight plan. I think that covers it. Thank you, lieutenant. Thank you, gentlemen. Zimmy. It's okay. Don't worry about a thing. I know you're tired, but let's talk a little. Sit down. Let's talk about luck. A pretty critical three minutes, Keith. Five crews, 50 men. - I know. - Whose fault was it? I told you, mine. - Do you rely on your navigator? - You have to rely on your navigator. - Then it was the lieutenant's fault. - It could've happened to anyone. I know. He feels as rotten about it as any of us do. But what happens now, Keith? I don't understand you, sir. We're talking about luck. I don't believe in it. I believe that a man makes his own luck. Yours has been pretty bad. It's getting worse. Maybe the navigator's in point. He blew it. What'll you do about it? I don't believe in chopping off heads because of one mistake. I don't think that's any way to run a group. I feel sorry for the boy, Keith. But what will your men think when he navigates again? That he messed up this one. If they fall apart, that won't be luck. They'd stake their lives on Zimmy. If it was anyone else. He's got two strikes against him. That boy's got a persecution complex. He wants to make up for his parents being in the German-American Bund. They screened Zimmy plenty before he got overseas. We're not short of good navigators. If you decide to relieve him, I'll give you a good replacement. You might as well ask me to shoot him in the back. I won't do it, sir. I can't do it to him! I won't! I want you to get to bed. Have the surgeon give you a shot so you'll sleep 24 hours. A man only has so much to give and you've given it. You're relieved of command. Report to me at Bomber Command. I'll send someone to take over. - Good night, Keith. - Good night, sir. The 918th will stand down until the new commanding officer arrives. - Want me to take it, sir? - No. I wanna talk, Frank. There's a hole in the dike, Frank. I'm scared stiff. Maybe you know how deep this goes, maybe you don't. I've got to spill it, anyhow. We're fighting all over the world. Every theater commander is screaming for crews and equipment. 50,000 airplanes. That's what they say they're building. I wish we had 500. Our problem right now narrows down to one group. If the 918th folds, it can spread to the other three groups. It can fold the whole deal. There's only one hope of shortening this war: Daylight precision bombing. If we fold, daylight bombing is done with. I don't know. Maybe it means the whole show. We could lose if we don't knock out German industry. You can smell what's coming. No man should have to do this job... ...who's had more than his share of combat. I'm asking you to take nice kids and fly... ...until they can't take anymore. Then fly some more. We've got to find out how much a man can take... ...and get it all. I don't know if any man can do it. That's what cracked Keith. What time can you get there tomorrow? Early, I guess. No squawks? It's hard to have one, the way you put it. Thanks, Frank. - Smoke, Ernie? - Thank you, sir. All right, sergeant. Yes, sir. - You know me? - No, sir. - Then why are you admitting me? - It's a staff car, sir. Gring could have been in it. - My A.G.O. Card. - The general may proceed. This is a military post, not a zoo. From now on you'll check everyone who enters. Take a good look at me. If you, or any man on this post, passes me up without saluting... ...you'll wonder what fell on you. - You might pass that word around. - Yes, sir. - Take my bags to my quarters. - Yes, sir. Good luck, sir. Thanks, Ernie. [WHISTLES] How do I address you? I don't quite understand, general. - What's your rank? How can I tell? - Sergeant Mclllhenny, sir. It's Private Mclllhenny now. Where's the air exec? He's not here, sir. He left after Lt. Zimmerman's funeral. - Zimmerman? - Yes. Navigator, sir. - What happened to him? - Suicide, sir. - Where's the ground exec? - In the hospital, sir. Mumps. - The adjutant? - Major Stovall's at the Officers Club. Get dressed and find him. - Ask him to report to me. - Yes, sir. [KNOCKING] Major Stovall, group adjutant. I remember you. Are you the only one around? Probably, sir. I presume you've come to take over the group? That's right. You been drinking, major? Yes. It's the first time I've been drunk in 20 years. But it may not be the last. - Where's the air exec? - I don't know, sir. It's only an opinion, but it's possible he's drunk too. - Is he off the station? - Yes, sir. - Where? - I don't know that, sir. Send the MPs to find him. Bring him to me under arrest. Under actual arrest, general? Exactly. Two: Cancel all leaves and passes. Make sure all squadron commanders are here by tonight. Three: Bring me the personnel files, the 66-1 s... ...on Gately and the key staff, including yours. Yes, sir. Four: Set a meeting for combat crew in the briefing room tomorrow at 0800. - Is that all, sir? - That's all. Yes, sir. - Colonel Gately is here, sir. - Send him in. That's all, men. - May I ask why I'm under arrest? - No. Stand at attention. You're the son of Lt. General Tom Gately, aren't you? That's my standard identification, sir. - How is he, as an officer? - None better, sir. That's right. You're the son of a fine officer, the grandson of another. You're a graduate of West Point with nine years' service. Your Form 5 shows that you've more four-engine time than any man here. You could've done more than anyone to take the load off Colonel Davenport. Records show you've flown only three missions since you've been here. - Is that right? - And I turned back twice. I take it you don't care about the part you had... ...in breaking one of the best men you'll ever know. As air exec you were in command here... ...the moment Colonel Davenport left. You met that responsibility exactly as you met his need. You ran out on it. You left the station to get drunk. Gately... ...as far as I'm concerned, you're yellow. A traitor to yourself, to this group... ...to the uniform you wear. It would be the easiest course to transfer you out... ...to saddle some unsuspecting guy with a deadbeat. Maybe you think that's what you're gonna get out of this, a free ride. But I'm not gonna pass the buck. I'm gonna keep you right here. I hate a man like you so much... ...that I'm gonna trample your head in the mud. You'll wish you'd never been born. - Lf that's all, sir. - I'm just getting started. You're gonna get a bellyful of flying. You'll make every mission. You're not air exec anymore. You're an airplane commander. And I want you to paint this name on the nose of your ship: "Leper Colony." You're gonna get every deadbeat... ...every man with a penchant for head colds. If there's a bombardier who can't hit his plate with his fork... ...you get him because you rate him. Is that clear? General Savage, I can file charges against you... ...for exceeding your authority... Get me Pinetree. I want General Pritchard. OPERATOR: Line's busy. Will you wait? - I'll wait. Rights, Gately. You've got a right to explain to General Pritchard... ...cowardice, desertion of your post, a yellow streak a mile wide. He can explain it to your father, so they'll both be proud. You could tell him right now. I have your line, sir. General Savage, I withdraw my statement. Hello? I have your line, sir. Never mind. That's all, then. Cut an order relieving Gately as air exec. Anybody else, sir? I'll let you know, major. One file, Cobb, squadron commander, shows a good record in the air. What are his qualifications? I'm sure you'll be pleased with any selection you make from the group. Thanks for the help, major. I'll be around the station. Sir? - I've been assigned as driver. - Fine. - Aren't you the clerk...? - Yes, sir. Private Mclllhenny. General officers rate sergeants as drivers. - Put those stripes back on. - Yes, sir. - Beer. - Yes, sir. Remove your cap in the club. - That's regulations, huh? - It is. Have another, Major Cobb. - Scotch. - I'll get it. No regulation against buying my own. That's right. Corporal. This bar is closed for tonight, and until further notice. I'll keep a light in the doghouse window for you. MAN: Come in. Major Stovall? Cut an order, assign Major Cobb as air exec. Yes, sir. - Good night. - Good night, sir. [CHATTERING] Attention! At rest. There'll be a briefing for a practice mission at 1100 this morning. That's right, practice. I've been sent here to take over what's known as a hard-luck group. I don't believe in hard luck, so we'll find out what the trouble is. Maybe part of it's your flying, so we're going back to fundamentals. I can tell you why I think you've been having hard luck. I saw it in your faces last night. I can see it there now. You've looked at a lot of air lately. You think you ought to have a rest. In short, you're sorry for yourselves. I have no patience with this stuff. We're in a war. A shooting war. We've got to fight. And some of us have got to die. I'm not trying to tell you not to be afraid. Fear is normal. But stop worrying about it, and about yourselves. Stop making plans, forget about going home. Consider yourselves dead. Once you accept that idea, it won't be so tough. Now, if any man here can't buy that... ...if he rates himself as special with a special hide to be saved... ...he'd better make up his mind about it now. Because I don't want him in this group. I'll be in my office in five minutes. You can see me there. MAN 1: I'll take Davenport any day. MAN 2: Me too. I'd better get to the office. The traffic's gonna be heavy. The air exec and the flight surgeon are here. Show them in. They beat you. I thought you'd be the first to ask for transfer. - No, sir. - It wouldn't do you any good. It doesn't go for staff. You're stuck with me. Tell them They thought you'd want to see them about the practice mission. For the general's information, you'll find Major Kaiser a top man. Thorough, knows his job. Cobb's an excellent man too. It's just he's a little too frank. - Thanks, major. - Yes, sir. - This is Major Kaiser. - Glad to see you. - I think you met Major Cobb. - Indeed, I have. I don't know if you still want me here after last night. I was stiff. Well, you laid it on the line. You got the job after I saw you, not before. You heard the briefing. Still want it? - I think I can cut it, sir. - See you at takeoff. What about crew availability? We have a critical morale problem. You gave them the shock treatment this morning, a bucket of cold water. That's how I should approach the problem as to how much stress they can take? Any man physically capable of handling his airplane goes. But some things can't be accomplished just by issuing an order. - You've seen the sick reports? - Yes. They indicate something else to me. Besides the stress of flying... ...these men have had the breaking up of a strong personal attachment. They were devoted to Davenport. He was the main thing they held on to. - Can you suggest a treatment? - Yes. Ease up. Give them a chance to get used to you. No, major. For two reasons. First, there isn't time. Second, I can't enter a popularity contest with Davenport. I'd lose that one. Also, I think they're better than that. All right, sir. That's it. Lt. Bishop to see you, sir. - Bishop? Who's he? - A pilot, sir. A recommendation for the Medal of Honor was sent to you. - I'll see him in a minute. - Yes, sir. I think I know how deep the problem is. The one thing that will solve it is pride. Pride in this group. A pride that makes it the last thing a man wants is to be left on the ground. And that's my job, not yours. Paint it with iodine and mark them duty. Yes, sir. STOVALL: Yes, sir? - Send Bishop in. I'd better practice saluting you first. I've added my name to that recommendation. - Thank you, sir. - Sit down, Bishop. Thank you, sir. But I should tell you why I'm here. Go ahead. The pilots asked me to be their spokesman. They want to transfer out. - How many of them? - All of them, sir. I can see why they sent you, Bishop. You make quite a spokesman. Have you thought this out? You're sure that's the way you feel? I think so, sir. Tell them to put their requests through channels. Meanwhile they fly. - That's all, then? - Yes, sir. [INTERCOM BUZZES] Yes? I just made some coffee, general. Shall I bring it in? Thanks, major. I'll come out there and get it. What are you doing? Personal effects of boys who got it to be sent to next of kin. I'm a little behind. I always write a letter. It takes time to screen the stuff pretty well. Might save somebody back home getting hurt unnecessarily. That's a tough chore. I don't envy you. How did you happen to get into paperwork? They didn't give me any choice. You see, I'm a retread. I had my shot at combat the first war. I wanted to get into this one... ...but they figured I was too old for anything but a desk. Maybe they were right. You liked Keith Davenport, didn't you? - A lot, I mean. - Yes, sir. I thought he was one of the finest men I ever knew. The same way the boys felt, I'm sure. Loyalty's a fine thing. Well... Thanks for the coffee, major. General Savage? I'd like to tell you something else I think. I'm a lawyer by trade. I think I'm a good one. When a good lawyer takes on a client, he believes in the case. That's all that matters. When I came to England, I took on my biggest client... ...the 918th Bomb Group. I wanna see my client win its case. - Does that answer what you had in mind? - On the button. What did you have in mind, exactly? I need time before those transfers go through. - How much time? - As much as we can get. Ten days. It'll take the squadron adjutants two days... ...to draw up all those requests. And let's see... I believe in thorough work. Everything in order. I've got a lot on my desk. - Three days before I get to them. - That's five. Take a couple of days to check them. That's seven. Squadron adjutants are sloppy sometimes... ...and I don't want them criticized for sloppy paperwork. - Do you? - No. Every request may have to go back to the adjutants to be done over. By the time I recheck them... ...it'll be 10 days before they're ready for signature. What a way to run an outfit. - You red-tape adjutants are all alike. - That's right, sir. But, Harvey, there can be trouble in this. I don't think so, sir. I never heard of a jury convicting the lawyer. Let me have your attention. In case you aren't clear what this is about, I'm supposed to be a deadbeat. So are you. That's why you were assigned to me. "The Leper Colony." How do you like it? You'll like it less after a mistake. A blowtorch is turned our way. Nobody's shoving me into it. Is that clear? Everything set? I'll ride in the top turret where I can see. Radio, rig an extension so the general can talk on the command set. All right, let's go. "Close it up. Close it up. Shove that damn wingtip right in his lap." Sweet Savannah! That wingtip's tickled me in the ribs for three days. - I'm tired of it. - Tell them. Another thing, for folks that talk about other people's ability... ...that general seems willing not to do any himself. We got us a talking general. "Get in there, now!" We're alerted, sir. Field order's coming in now. Tell Cobb to wheel and deal. I'll be right over. Operator, keep this line clear. Get me the bomb dump. Hurry. Two missions, only one aircraft lost. Very little battle damage. That's because most of the time we flew tight formation. The enemy took a look and didn't want a part of the 918th. The bad side, the bombing. Fair, particularly the low squadron. We drop practice bombs every day we haven't got a mission. Cobb. That's your baby. Anybody got any comment? - I've got some more. Henley? - Here, sir. You've been late with your bombs the last two missions. Why? No excuse, sir. I'll say this for you, you're honest. Nine men risk their lives to ride with you to drop on target. Gately? Here's a new bombardier for you. - Pettinghill? - Yes, sir. We're lucky to have only one loss. Why did you break formation? Ackerman was in trouble. Two engines on fire, and we were getting enemy fighters. I figured I'd stay back and try to cover him. But he couldn't make it. - Ackerman a friend of yours? - My roommate, sir. For the sake of your roommate you violated group integrity. Every gun is able to give the group maximum defensive firepower. When you go out of formation, you reduce the group's power by 10. A crippled airplane is expendable. What is never expendable is your obligation to this group. This group. That has to be your loyalty, your only reason for being. - Stovall? - Yes, sir. Work out a reassignment of quarters so every man has a new roommate. Gately? Baxter's promoted out of the Leper Colony. Pettinghill's your copilot. That's all I've got. - Anybody got anything else? - What about our transfers? Okay, if that's all. Dismissed. [KNOCKING] Come in. Keith. Come on in. Glad to see you. How are you? How's the adjutant business? I'm out of that line of work. Ground exec now. - Glad to hear it. You had it coming. - Thanks. Good to see you. - Good to see you, Harvey. - Piece of cake? It's a bit old. Many happy returns. - I've seen this joint before. - Looks better with you in it, Keith. Have a drink. The boys will be glad to see you. I'm not so sure. I saw Sergeant Keller at the gate. Had to show my A.G.O. Card to get in. I just dropped down for a minute. Something I want to talk to you about. I'll get on about my exec-ing. I'll see you before you go. All right, Harvey. - Nice guy, Harvey. - First-rate. Sit down. Tastes good. Gets the chill out of your bones. - What a stinking climate. - It's pretty bad. You didn't come to talk about the weather. No. Or maybe I did at that. - There's a storm coming, Frank. - The old man? I don't know if he knows about it. Those transfer requests. None have come through. - You been sitting on them? - I have. You've got a mutiny on your hands. The inspector general's got them. If he investigates you, you're cooked. Can you slow him down? The old man can't interfere with the IG. You want a few good missions. Maybe they'll change their minds. - But it won't work that way. - You got any ideas? To be frank, when you took command here, I was hoping you'd fail. I'm that human. I blew it, but I want to tell you how to run this group. - Shoot. - All right. You're blowing it too. You can't drive those boys. They can't be just a set of numbers. My blowing it doesn't mean that idea was wrong. My failure was me. I wasn't good enough. You've got to help them, Frank, or they will walk out on you. That'll be a worse failure than mine was. Give them something to lean on? Call it anything you like. Well, Keith... I don't believe it. Here's where we part company. They're not boys. They're men. Too bad to have to find out so young. How old is Bishop? Twenty-one, maybe. It's tough to have to grow all the way up at 21. But that's the only way we're gonna get it done. And I think they can do it. Lean on somebody? I think they're better than that. If that's not true, then we're a dead duck. We'd better find out about it right now. Once and for all. Well, that's that. You called a turn for me once, and I couldn't see it. Now we're even. - Good night, Frank. - Good night, Keith. [PIANO PLAYING AND SINGING] MAN: Not again. No good, sir. The other groups turned back. Nothing from the 918th. - Forget code. Try in the clear. - Yes, sir. Pinetree to Flashlight Leader. This is a recall. Do you read me? Pinetree to Flashlight Leader. This is a recall. Do you read me? Nothing, sir. Weren't all commanders told to go on channel B? It was in the field order, sir. Something's happened. They've gone on to the target alone. I'm going down there. I can't just stand here. That's 21. They're all back. That's something. I'm glad we still have miracles. We had a little weather, but the target area cleared. We clobbered it. That's fine. What about the recall? Recall, sir? Never heard it. Must have had radio malfunction. - I see. Let's get up to your office. - Yes, sir. Bar's open, Harvey. The boys really earned it today. You think I'm going to buy a Persian rug about a radio malfunction! You'll tell me next you didn't see the others turn back. You've no right to gamble with my money. It isn't enough that you plant an inspector on me. I've lived without them for 20 years. Don't justify this because you got away with it. I didn't hear a thing. - You're sticking to that fairy tale? - Yes, sir. There's one more thing, sir. The 918th got through today and bombed the target. Nobody else did. If I get another chance to give this group... ...the pride it ought to have... ...I may have radio malfunction again, sir. There's one more thing. I'm asking you for a commendation for this group... ...for their courage in bombing under very adverse conditions. You don't need to mention the leadership. You'll get it. Maybe I'll send you one for leadership. I don't know. - Got somebody that can take dictation? - Yes, sir! Mclllhenny, bring a book and pencil in here. Come on. Hurry up! Relax, Harvey. Mission accomplished. What do you make of it? I don't know. I can't make it out. They're pleased, but they're not celebrating the way kids ought to. It's not normal. No cries for "Savage for President," then? I don't know. Get hold of Bishop. Tell him I'd like to see him in my quarters. - Smoke, Bishop? - No, thank you, sir. I wanted to talk with you, because I know you'll level with me. I wish you'd try to tell me what you're feeling right now. - About, sir? - The transfers. That we showed them how it's done today. If you're proud of that. - I can't speak for the rest of them. - Then don't. Just speak for you. Well, sir, that's hard. I don't know how I feel. - That's kind of the trouble. - What is? The whole thing, sir. Everything. I can't see what good our bombing's doing. And all the boys getting killed. Just a handful of us. We're some kind of guinea pigs, only we're not proving anything. You've got to have confidence in something. When you find something you've got confidence in, everything changes. It just doesn't make any sense. - I just want out. - Would it be better in another group? It isn't a question of that. I don't wanna fly anymore. Doesn't it mean anything that we hit the target with no losses? Yes, sir. I suppose so. In a way. But I just want out. That's a pretty tough request from a Medal of Honor man. Sure we're guinea pigs, Jesse. But there's a reason. If we can hang on here now... ...one day soon somebody's gonna look up... ...and see a solid overcast of American bombers... ...on their way to Germany to hit the Third Reich where it lives. Maybe we won't see it. I can't promise that. But I can promise they'll be there, if only we can make the grade now. I'd like to believe you, sir. I just don't have confidence anymore. Well... Looks like I'm chopping and no chips are flying. It's easy to transfer out of a group. It's hard for a man to transfer out of his obligation. But every man has to play it the way he sees it. - Good night, Jesse. - Good night, sir. How's it going? The inspector's got every pilot in there. Cigarette. - You got a light too? - I have only the habit. Well... ...they're still at it, sir. You'll make a silly-looking second lieutenant. Don't ever give up the case before the jury comes in. Don't kid yourself. So what? What's so bad about the Pentagon? Good food, cocktails. - Well, sir, that was short and sweet. - I'll bet it was. Unpack. The IG didn't even make an opening speech. Bishop withdrew his transfer. Wilson followed, and the rest climbed aboard. Left the IG with nothing to do but go home. What do you know? Where's that briefcase? I had it a minute ago. They couldn't buck you forever. They realize they had a chance with you leading. Better not count on one man. Don't make that mistake. It wouldn't be bad to cut loose with a few passes to London. A pat on the back. I see what you mean. Kiss and make up, huh? You kiss them for shedding their diapers. Tell them we're going to work on building leadership. Tell them you're gonna lead the next one, and it better be good. Tell Bishop he'll find out what it feels like. I want every man who shows signs of being able to lead a mule to water. I want them all to have a crack. You're out from under those second lieutenant bars. Let's get to work. - Why burn 3 feet off my tail surface? - Tough man? He's taking this iron-tail business too far. Yeah, he's pretty iron-tailed. He'll never feel for the group like Davenport did. - Nothing will eat holes through him. - There's such a thing as being human. You know what? The only difference between Savage and Davenport... ...is that Savage is about that much taller. I don't get it. Hey, Joe. How come you ain't leading this one? Been a bad boy? You know Joe, he only leads the milk runs. Where are we going? Pull back the curtain. - You'll wish I was leading it. - Attention! Rest. This you'll be interested to know: Intelligence says the German aircraft industry... ...was converted to the production of fighter planes for defense. Fighters are being withdrawn... ...from the Russian front to defend this one. They must have heard about the 918th! This morning's mission is important. - For the first time... - Germany. You said it. Wilhelmshaven. For the first time we'll be targeting German soil. I'll lead. Bishop, high squadron, Hollerman the low. All right, Joe. Stations, 0700. Start engines, 0710. Taxi, 0720. Got a cigarette? They're heading in. - How many? - I don't know, sir. Here they come. They're approaching the field. Nine. Fourteen. Fifteen, sixteen. How was it, sir? Rough. They were waiting for us. The count? Two. Looked like four. O'Neal made it to Lincolnshire. Gately ditched in the Channel and was picked up. Two wounded. Let's get up to interrogation. - Mclllhenny. - Yes, sir. - Were you in my ship? - No, sir. - That is... Yes, sir. - Who authorized it? No one. But I've been checked out as a gunner. I had to make the big ones. I won't have personnel jeopardizing aircraft safety. Maybe you'll keep on the ground by removing those stripes. And this time you stay a private. - Get up to interrogation. - Yes, sir. I want a critique of the mission first thing in the morning. We might stand down a few days with the weather. They're ready for a breather. Deal out some passes for London. I gotta talk to you about Sgt. Mclllhenny. - What about him? - Busting him complicates things. How? It's the precedent. We'd have to bust Captain Twombley too. - What about him? - He stowed away too. Bishop found out over Wilhelmshaven. He heard the parson praying when he was firing. Now I've heard everything. I'm afraid you haven't. I'll give it to you in one slug. No, thank you. Harvey Stovall and Doc Kaiser flew with Klein. The whole ground echelon was some place on this one. - Any of them hurt? - Don't think so, sir. One more thing about Mclllhenny... ...he's been credited with two FWs destroyed and one probable. A born gunner, I guess. - Did you know about this, Joe? - No, sir, I didn't. - I hope you don't think... - All right, all right. Twombley, Stovall! Come over here. You're pretty proud of yourselves, I suppose. - Let me... - I hoped you wouldn't go into this. I think I am suffering from combat fatigue. I'm gonna weaken, just this once. I'll probably live to regret it. You got the bulge on me. I can't bust everybody. With an understanding that your combat days are over. You ought to know better. I won't like having to write a letter to your wife. You, Padre, your business is sin. You'll confine your activities to that theater of operations. Clear? Yes, sir. Hit anything up there? Sir, my glasses were frosted over, but I think I got a piece of one. Ours or theirs? Mclllhenny. I heard about those two FWs. - Put the chevrons back on. - Yes, sir. If we keep on having these ups and downs, get zippers. Yes, sir! MAN 1: When are they due back? MAN 2: Any time now. Call the tower. Get a count. Tower. What's the count? Twenty back, one missing. 397. We lost one, 397. Lieutenant Bishop, sir. Thanks, sergeant. - See any chutes? - No. Jesse got a direct burst right over the target. They didn't have a chance. He was a swell kid. One of the best pilots. He would get it. Could've been much worse. And battle damage? Everybody caught plenty. - More coffee, general? - General... - I tried to phone you about Gately. - Did he get hit? No, sir. But right after he landed, he passed out cold. I should've examined him, but he didn't report an injury the other day. The x-rays show a crack in the lip of the vertebrate body. Painful? Incredibly. He's flown three missions with it. - A fractured spine? - That's it. I've put him in traction. Gately. Okay, Doc. Thanks for letting me know. - Now I'll have that coffee. - Okay. Anyone in particular you'd like to see, sir? No, thanks, lieutenant. Just looking around. - Go right on with what you were doing. - Yes, sir. - That'll cut in on your crap-shooting. - It's costing me. - How long will you be here? - Ten days. - Tell me if I can do anything. - Thanks. Birdwell, they get all that flak out of you? Just about, sir. Doc didn't need no mine detector to find it. - You getting enough chow? - Just living in the tall cotton, sir. - How are you feeling, Ben? - I'm okay, general. I was sorry to hear about your bad luck. Thank you, sir. Doc didn't waste much time. Oh, excuse me, Ben. That's pretty sensitive, huh? That's okay, general. Go ahead and sit down. I'd rather stand. I've been piling up more sitting time than flying time anyway. What kind of a gadget is this? Part of the Wright brothers' plane? Looks uncomfortable enough. - Help the back any? - Relieves the pressure a bit, sir. How long did Doc say you're gonna be laid up? A few weeks, sir. - Is it pretty painful? - Not much, sir. - Guess you don't feel like talking... - Go ahead. Ben... Yes, sir? I was just gonna say... Anything you want? Something I can send you? Not a thing, general. I've got everything I need. Let us know if you need anything. Thank you, sir. I'm gonna drop in across the hall. I'll be seeing you, Ben. I'll have to rate you a Class A customer. I just learned you're something "extra special." This mission has been handed us by the combined chiefs of staff. It is a target of critical importance, which requires deep penetration... ...far beyond possible fighter support. If we can destroy it, we'll have proved daylight bombing. This is the one we've waited for. With our limited equipment... ...it'll take three trips to carry enough bombs to destroy the target. You will have to plan these strikes down to the last pint of gas... ...the last pound of load, the last second of time. All right, Colonel Davenport. There it is, what we're after. Ball bearings. Almost the entire German production is concentrated here. Without ball bearings, the German armament industry will halt. I wish I had something stronger for you, Frank. If we pull this off, things will pick up. - We may get three or four new groups. - Growing up, huh? How soon do you think you can come back up here and help me? That's hard to say, sir. Why? On paper the group looks fine now. Leadership's a problem, always has. Haven't you got the personnel? There's nothing wrong with our personnel. I lost Bishop and Hollerman. Cobb's okay. So's Gately, but he's just out of the hospital. Takes time to know. - How long before you will know? - I don't know that one either. How can you be sure? How do you know what you're pushing Gately into? How do we know we didn't send Bishop up once too often? I'm down there... Frank! You're swinging after the bell. Tell me something. What was the name of the man you relieved? Who, Keith? Remember his trouble? You're not propping them up too, are you? Take a good look, Frank. Do you think that? It would be natural enough. The things you go through with those boys. Working your way out of the hole. It's hard not to let them get to you. You've been flying more missions rather than less. I'm the one who's got to shove them up there. Until they're ready, I won't turn them loose. All right, Frank. Make it as soon as you can, will you? - You bet I will, sir. - You'll tell me when? - Yes, sir. - Bring me back a ball bearing. As a personal favor, keep yourself in one piece. That seems like a reasonable request. - Good night, sir. - Good night. - Keith? - Yes, sir? I want the files on all the air execs and operations officers... ...recommending those who'd take over in an emergency. - Anything special? - No, but keep it to yourself. - Yes, sir. - Thanks. - Tail wheel? - Locked. Light off, sir. Brakes. Over splasher beacon 9, navigator. Set course for combat wing assembly line. Tail gunner, let me know when the other groups tack on to me. Savage to crew. 10,000 feet. Go on oxygen. From now on we're registering on the enemy radar screen. Watch your talk. Don 't tell them more than we have to. Navigator to commander. Departing English coast on course, on time, sir. Savage to gunners. Okay to test your guns. Yeah. Again? Picked them up yet? - The air ministry's on the scrambler. - Say it again. All right. Thanks. I'll ring you again. Your aircraft is approaching the enemy coast at 24,000 feet. Our intercept station reports the largest enemy reaction ever recorded. They're ordering down units from as north as Denmark... ...and as far south as lafu Five. Here's a new wrinkle. They're instructing pilots to ram your aircraft if necessary. Navigator. Do you think we crossed the enemy coast? Yes, sir. We sure have. Change course. Fifteen degrees left. Heads up, everybody. Look out for fighters. MCILLHENNY: Four FWs 10 o 'clock level. Climbing. CO-PILOT: I'm coming up on the side! You on the interphone. Be specific. How many? Where? Eleven FWs three o 'clock. On your toes, both squadrons. Here they come. Twelve o'clock high. Cobb, they're heading for the high squadron. MAN 1: Birdwell got a direct hit. He's going down. MAN 2: Squadrons climbing at 12 o 'clock. - I see them. Six more, nine o 'clock level. About a mile. Gately, pull that squadron forward. Abel to Baker and Charlie leaders. They'll fake an attack to cover the real one. Watch out for mass attacks, eight and 10 abreast. MAN 1: More coming around from one. Watch them! MAN 1: I got one. He's bailing out. MAN 2: 17 dropping out of blue squadron. In trouble. Keep an eye on him. MAN 2: Two men bailing out. Three more. They're on fire. Save your ammunition. We got a way to go. Shorten bursts. Don't waste rounds. MAN 3: B- 17 out of control, three o 'clock. MAN 4: There goes another Charlie, sir. Navigator, did we make up that 2.5 minutes yet? Yes, sir. We... Watch out! If it doesn't shift any more, we'll be okay at control 0.7. Here come three more. Close it up tight. Savage to crew. How bad are we hit? We're hit bad, sir, in radio compartment, on fire. See what you can do about it. Rest of crew, hold your stations. Let's settle down. Bombardier to commander. Fly at 12 o'clock. We can forget about fighters for a while. Abel to Baker and Charlie Force. Change of plan. Start your bomb run from Halstuben. MAN 5: Charlie leader. Wilco. MAN 6: Baker to Abel. We'll be bombing in a crosswind. Second target clear. Abel to Baker. No dice. We'll hit the primary. - Your new IP is Halstuben. - Roger. - Halstuben dead ahead, sir. - Pilot to bombardier. Center PDI. PDI centered, sir. Pilot to bombardier. You're flying the airplane now. Bomb bay doors open. We clobbered them! Right on the button. We're heading home. How's that formation back there? Baker Force reassembling. Charlie Force is strung out bad. - FWs attacking stragglers. - Abel to Charlie. We'll give you a turn to the left. Cut across and get back in formation. We'll be turning over a heavy flak, though, sir. Better than leaving those stragglers to the fighters. Roger. Direct burst. Bail out, Joe. Bail out! Jump, you guys, jump! Well, Keith. Welcome to Operation Stovall. - How does it look for tomorrow? - Can't tell yet. Lots of damage. - I'm sorry about Joe. - That's the way it goes. - How's the weather? - Looks okay. Looks like all we've got left to do is get it done. - The old man was mighty pleased. - He ought to be. Tomorrow might wash it up if we're any good. - Know he went on the mission? - No! Slipped into Mayer's. He didn't know until he crossed the coast. So the old man's stowing away these days, huh? If I'd known, I'd have cut him closer with the flak. How are the others? They'll put up the maximum for tomorrow. - Good. - Maximum. Maximum effort. Are you drunk, Colonel Stovall? I am a little. I believe I warned the general it might happen again sometime. Well, keep it going until tomorrow night and I'll join you. I believe I shall, sir. Harvey drew the worst end of the racket. Sitting, watching them come and go, all those stinking papers. That is not why I am drunk. I got drunk because I am confused. I was thinking, which is a thing one should not do. Then I couldn't remember what any of them looked like. I couldn't see their faces. Bishop, Cobb... ...Wilson, Zimmy. All of them. All of you. They all looked alike. Just one face... ...and it was very young. It confused me. I think I shall stay drunk... ...until I'm not confused anymore. Stay with it, Harvey. You boys will have to carouse someplace else. Good night, sir. Good night, Keith. Am I gonna sleep tonight. - Good night, sir. - Good night. Guess it's about that time. Good luck, Frank. Good luck, sir. - What's the matter, sir? - I don't know. - Are you sick? - Something's wrong. My arm won't work. You want me to take it? No. Tell... Tell... - Tell Gately to take it. - Yes, sir. He'll take it. Get ahold of Doc Kaiser. I'll take the lead ship. Where's my oxygen mask? Frank. Come on, Frank. Come on, get in the jeep. Frank, are you sick? Stop it! Stop it! I'm right here, Frank. It's okay. He can't make it! They can't go! You can't send them out again. Stop them! Stop them! Cigarette, Frank? How about a smoke? What do you make of it? State of shock. Complete collapse. Everything let go at once. Can't you give him a hypo? Knock him out? In his condition, it wouldn't be any good. He's up there with the mission. When they get back, maybe he'll let go. I hope. I never figured it could happen to him. I did. He swept his feelings under the carpet. It had to spill out. But he was full of fight at briefing. Have you seen a light bulb burn out? How bright the filament is before? I think they call it maximum effort. [PHONE RINGS] Colonel Davenport. That's fine. Thanks very much. The strike report, Frank. They hit the primary okay. Gately reports, "Results good." They clobbered it, Frank. Frank, try and listen to me. I know just what you're feeling. You think you blew it. What do you expect of yourself, Frank? Look. I saw something in those kids' faces at briefing. Something I never put there. You were gonna make them grow up, remember? They were this morning. You're up there with them. You're riding in every crew station and in every cockpit. That's right. Don't listen to me. Sit there and do it the hard way. Tell yourself that you blew it. Eat your guts out until you're hollow inside. Don't let anybody help you! They're back, Frank. Six. Seven. [PLANES ROARING] Eight. Nine. Ten. Piccadilly Lily. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Control Tower. - Tower. - Did you get a count? Twenty-one dispatched, nineteen returned, sir. The boys really did it today. Nineteen. They made it. Nineteen of them. - Who led? - Ben Gately. Is he back all right? Yes, Frank. He's back. I'm kind of tired. I think I'll go to sleep for a little while. [VOICES SINGING]
