If you had any action films on video, I'd buy them from you. What do you think... What do you think's better, karate or kung fu? I'll see you, then. Might see you tomorrow. You know who you remind me of sitting there? Your mum. I wondered when she was gonna come into it. Just a sec. Sorry. You live in a fucking dream world. Here we go. Don't you listen to anything I'm saying? - I am fucking listening. - You watch my lips moving - but don't take in what I'm saying. - Don't fucking talk patronising to me! If you was a fucking geezer, I'd stick that right in your face. That's all you can resort to, that's all you know. You sound like your fucking mum. I knew it wouldn't be long before she was dragged into it. She's rumped everyone down the fucking road. This is about me and you, not my mother. Its not just about me and you, its about me, you and Little Davey, and you wanna get this in your fucking nut. If I walk out, little Davey's coming with me. - Oh, no, he's all right where he is. - I don't fucking think so. Do you know that cunt over there, keeps staring? - Who? - Him, that noncey-faced cunt there. No, I don't know who he is. Can you please concentrate on me? This is my argument, Paul. You never take in what I want or what I'm saying. What is this bollocks about you need space? I know what that means. - I ain't fucking stupid, you know. - It means I want space. - Time to sort myself out. - I think it means you've got a geezer. - Oh, here we go. - I ain't fucking stupid. Tell me. You've got someone, ain't you? - You're not listening to me. - I fucking am. No, you're not listening to me! - Here he goes again. - What? Do you fucking know my old woman? Do you fucking know my old woman, cunt? - Leave him alone. - What's all the fucking staring about? - Sorry. - You noncey-faced cunt! Yeah, sorry? I'll fucking sorry! - Eh? Do you fucking know her? - Oi, oi, oi! - Paul! - Fuck off! Get your hands off me! - Get that cunt out of here. - I will. - Before I lose my temper. - Calm down, I'll get him out. - Calm down. - Is that him? Get out. If I see you again, cunt, I'll break your fucking neck. /Oh, God! Oi, Davey, you're coming in in 20 minutes for your dinner. What we having? - Nuggets. - Do we have to?
