Excuse Me, Miss Finch. You Sent Big Bird To The Dodos, Didn'T You? Yes. I Found Him A Lovely Home. And Why Was That? Because He Belongs With His Own Kind. What Kind Is That? Birds. Hmm. Yes. Well, Why Do You Suppose He Ran Away From Home? I Can'T Imagine. Quiet! Such A Lovely Home. Such A Lovely Family.
