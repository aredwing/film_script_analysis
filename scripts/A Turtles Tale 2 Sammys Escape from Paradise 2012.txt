I'll call you ... Ricky. Cool. Good luck on your journey, my little adventurer. Well they don't stay cute forever. That's for sure. Ray ... honey, it's time! - What? - If you get your head out of the sand you could ... Wait! Let me get my head out of the sand. Now what did you say, baby boo? It's hatch time, it's almost over ... Why didn't you say so in the first place? Let me sleep my life away ... miss all the fun ... Always my fault. Let me help you out, Ella. Hello. You look just like your mother. - And who are you? - I'm your grandfather. So ... now where do I go? Just go to the sea. Grandma will help you. - Oh, that looks like fun! Shelly ... honey! Just a few more and we're done. OK! I'll be right back. Everybody ready? Hold on! - Here we go. - How many we got left? - Almost finished! Sammy, behind you! Hey, watch it bird! Hurry, kids ... That was a low blow! - Leave us alone! Hey, beat it bake breath! Oh so sorry, but no can do it! - A bird's got to eat you know. - Help! - Not on my watch, bird! - What do you want from us? Get lost! It's the young ones we're after. I mean, when you look at you two ... You're ancient! Which means ... Not too tasty! Look, Ray, there is more! My favorite sushi Stay away from here. I got the food wrapped in seaweed. Oh do save me some, boys. I'll take care of these old geezers. Oh, yeah? Stand still and I'll show you what an old turtle's made of. Back off! Nice try. Can we move any slower? You gonna regret this! You two can do better than that. What a mismatch we got here. Fly! Fly! Fly! - We got them! - Wait. What about other turtles? These two will do. - Touch up the net. - What about the bird? We keep them too, man. My cousin he likes to barbecue. He fried him a .... Sammy! Head down. Ray, we've got to save the hatchlings. - Shall I push them through the net. - Oh! They are strong. Oh, no, Ray! Hurry, Ella, run to the sea. Go, go, go! - Careful. -Don't let them get out. I get this. Grab that side, Captain. Grandpa, wait! This is the best catch. Eh, Captain! -Yeah - I don't wanna leave you! It's okay, sweetie. Quick! Go tell grandma to wait for us here. We'll find a way out. But I want to help you! Ray! Oh, no. Stay away, baby boo! We'll be back! I hope ... Oh, no, honey. Sammy. I got it. Let me help you. It's too high, Ray. Look out! Where do you think you're going? You stay in there! Hey, watch out, Bay barber! You darn near crack me open! Let's hear it. The situation is a total disaster! I recommend an immediate withdrawal. What's your problem? I feeling unlocked. I am about to grow old. Wobbly in the claws. Don't you hoping to jump in here! - You know? Number 1, number 2 - Aha, yeah. Got it. - We're trapped in a looney bay! - I don't know where it's gone. - I don't know. I don't see any. - Where are we? - Upside down. - That was fun! - What was that? Hi, grandpa ... Oh, no! What are they doing in here? Things have just gone from bad to worse. We need to get them off this boat before it's too late. Too late for what, Grandpa? We want to help. What now? Getting you two out of here. But we want to stay with you. Ray! Give us a boost here! - I saw a big bird! - Where? It's okay. He's in a cage. Good! Where he belong. Hold on. I'm thinking. Maybe if we help him, he'll help us. Are you serious? I'd be careful. You can never trust a bird. Oh, oh, oh. No, no. Don't even think about it. Hey, bird! I got a deal for you. A deal? I get you out of there. You get the little ones back into the sea. - It's a deal! - And you don't eat them! Always a catch. Okay, hang on tight. Here we go! I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I will swear off turtle meat. From now on I'm strictly vegan. Get the damn bird off my boat! Oh and maybe a small dinner too ... Nice plan, Sammy ... - Yeah, I know. - Shut your pie hole! Oh, my blood brother is just plain rude. Boys, come on. I got to apologize for you all now. They just be, flatten our gums, silly is all. My name's Lulu La Morte. Three L's, one E. Give me a hand with this, brother! They'll be after the catch. I guess, we really are trapped. - That's good. - Hoi, a little help over here. What demand, demand? Too heavy for you? Look out! What was that? I'm going in. Watch out. Watch out! See them go. - What's going on out here? - Soar! Get out of here! It's all over for me, man. They got you good. - These birds have gone crazy. - Oh, it's nasty! Stop it! I'm hit. You're in my blazing territory. Why don't you think like a hairy clam in a hot tub. Get out of here! Okey dokey! I got room here for two hatchlings! No, grandpa, no. I don't have all day. Ah, buckaroo. You'll not get away with this. Come on now. I don't like this. - Grandpa, no! - Come on, bird. Not so funny now, huh? You win some. You lose some. See ya! You come back again, you not so lucky. Okay, close the holding tank. Clean up this mess. I've had enough of these birds. That was awesome! Yeah! There is a dead fish in here. That's a strange fish. Look at his nose. He is very unlucky. - Is he really dead? - I think so. What do you think happened to him? I think the humans must have .... Somebody fall off some bad clams or what? You have really big eyes. All the ladies say that. Reflex thing. No big wop. The name is Jimbo. I'm Ella. That's Ricky. Ono, our grandfather. Hey, what's up? They say we're trapped here. Any idea where they might be taking us? Well, the first time I got caught, they swing me right back in! Said I was too small and too ugly! Can you believe that? Second time, they hauled me off to the big tank. - And that would be where? - Up north. A lot of fish up there. My guess is that's where we're headed. They're going to eat us? Oh, no, no! They actually feed us, three square meals a day! Right now, any place but in here sounds like paradise to me. Yeah, well, that depends. There are, shall we say, certain elements to contend with. That doesn't sound good. - What do you have for me today? - I've got your turtles, man. Ho, ho. Fantastic! Very nice specimens! Just what I needed. And how about the big lobster, boss ... and the blob fish? You are trying to sell me a dead fish? No, he ain't dead. You see, man. Who not going to .....? Good, cos we lost one last year. Okay, I'll take him. - But I'm not so sure about the lobster. - Boss, consider it my present to you. You can eat him, if you don't want him in the aquarium. No, I'm vegetarian. Oh, I didn't know that. - I don't like it. - Come on, let's hide. What is this? Much better now. Sir, our special guests have arrived. - Can I offer you a cocktail? - Yes, thank you. Look! They look like royalty. Wow! Look at this place! - So many fish! - I told you. This is going to be the best birthday party ever! Welcome to Burj Al Bar, Your Highness. We here, at the Pearl of the Sea are delighted to host your birthday party. Right this way, Your Highness. - Look! - Great, penguins. Your Highness, ours is the largest underwater aquarium in the entire world. Here, we've recreated five marine ecosystems. I assure you, it will be a most enjoyable experience for you and your guests. Race you guys to the bottom! Wait for me! You'll be pleased to know, that we have introduced a new species into our aquarium just in time for your visit. - There we have a green sea turtle! - Oooh, wow! - Look how big that turtle is. - It's huge. And next to him, is a very large leatherback. Magnificent. Humans under water ... What is this place? I thought I had seen it all. But this is some strange stuff going on in here. - SPC on deck, sir. - Say what? SPC? Split Personality Crustacean. I'll be quiet now. - Ray, have you seen Ricky and Ella? - No, I haven't. I thought they were all floated after we were. This is a big place. They're probably wandering around. Or maybe they got thrown back in. Whoa, show time! It is really scary looking. And ugly chimp. That's our blob fish! Crazy looking eyes, huh, kids? Jimbo, we need to find the little ones. Welcome, amigos! Jimbo! Mi brochacho! You're looking good for a muerto fish! Muerto? What the ... ? That! I'll explain later. Ray, Sammy, meet Manuel. Laquel La Luna de Loco to be exact. At your service. Mi amor! Look who it is! Hi Jimbo! Oh, you missed me so much. You came back from the dead. Okay, somebody needs to explain the dead part. Toots! My favorite clown fish! What's the joke of the day? Why is the fish eating away? - Beats me. - Because he has no scales! Nice! That's a good one. And you must be Sammy and Ray. Actually, it's the other way around. Well, whoever you are, remember. If this place gets you down, Toots will cheer you up. We're not sticking around here long enough to get depressed. Once we find the little ones, we're out of here. I'll keep an eye peeled! So, do you have a plan? We'll think of something. That's what all newbie say. It's not that simple. Say, Papi's right. Mira, if you want to escape, you have to go through Big D. Trust me, there is no other way. Where do we find this Big D? He finds you. You don't mess with the "D". He rules this place with an iron fin. We'll be all clean and ship-shaped, Captain. - You can trash it out now. - Okay. Stand clear. Grandpa! Jimbo! Where did everybody go? - I am losing it! - Hold on! - You got to hold on to me! - I can't. It's too strong. And now what are we going to do? Watch out! Marco. Should we do it? What do you mean "we"? - You should do it. - Why me? Because you're smoother. You're just saying that. No no, no, no. It's true. You are like silky, oyster smooth. - Boss? - You see. Smooth. Maybe a little louder, but gentle. - Boss. - What? What? What do you want? Jimbo ... he's back. - Jimbo? Jimbo? Like in "Supposed to be dead Jimbo"? He don't look dead no more, boss. And, oh yeah, we just got in two ginormous turtles. You are killing me, here! We get two walking air breathers and you don't tell. But we just found out. You two have the combined IQ of a grain of sand! And, one more thing, D. Your cousin, the one with the crazy hats on? Yeah, yeah, Tremaine! What about him? You are not going to believe this, boss. We caught him trying to flush out last night. Why is he that way? What a dope. He's a couple of clams short of a chowder. - Get my drift? - Yes. But we have one little problem, boss. He's saying it was your idea and you don't have a frigging clue ... His words. How to get out of here. Digame, Jimbo ... What was it like being on the outside again? Bad for me. Ah, you miss the free food in here, hah, Jimbo? Ah, you got me. And you guys too, of course. Sammy, I haven't eaten in at least two or three hours. I'm suddenly very hungry. Relax, I only eat jellys. You know, the small, tender ones. Hey, we've got company. Well, well ... if it isn't the mug that sunk a thousand ships? - How is it going, Big D? - As good as ever. But you were supposed to be dead. I'm still waiting to hear that story! Hey, watch your mouth. The Boss does not like to be interrupted! - Sorry to disappoint you, Big D. - Disappoint me? I'm ecstatic! You proved my escape plan worked. Actually, it was my plan. I was ... my mistake. Your plan. Whatever. You got out. Welcome to my world, in the middle of Jabip, or wherever we are. Enough! What say we take a swim around the neighborhood, huh? Get to know each other. Come on. I won't bite. Very hard. Some nerve, huh? If he was a jelly. Do you know what I mean? Just play along. We have to find Ricky and Ella. What's with him? - Who? - Numb nuts? Pay no attention. Albert's lost his mind. This joint can do that to you. Hi, Albert. What's that door for? - Can't we just ... - Forget about it! If it was that easy, we'd already be out of here! That was some blow hole! Hey Big D, hold up. Where are all those bubbles coming from? It is a filtration system. Too narrow, even for me. So check this place out. Nice, huh? Looks like some kind of ancient temple for a king. No bounds, I doubt it! - Boss, I think you have an intruder. - What? Where? Hey, that's our friend, Lulu. Who let him into my place? What do you mean, "your place"? I mean, it's a "Restricted Area". A "No Swim" zone. Capice? - Who does he think he is? - Let him go. He is with us. Alright, release him! Hey you! When and if, you need to talk to me, you check with my two assistants here, first. Never in my life, have I been subjected to this kind of cruel and hostile treatment. Keep a tight claw! They can torture us all day long. Hang down. Speak for yourself. Listen ... Nobody's getting tortured here. In fact, I got a mission for you, soldier. At your command! Sir, what kind of mission? A covert mission. It will be dangerous. Are you ready? We're ready as rain, sir! Nice in here, don't you think? Big D! Good to see you. How is it going, my friend? I'm beautiful. Any more trouble from the halibut? Not since you had that conversation with them. I truly appreciate it. Call it positive reinforcement. - I owe you. - You do. They are with me. Give me some light over here. And watch your head, big guys. Hey guys, you making headway down here? Please, don't let me interrupt. - Keep up the good work, boys! - What are they digging for? It's a tunnel to get us out of here. Come on. Seriously? Hey, crabs dig. It is what they do. And it keeps them occupied. Oh hi, Big D! Hey hi, cutie. So, how are we doing with the escape plan? Oh, if you don't mind me asking. I'm working on, sweetheart. You'll be the first to know. I promise. I'm counting on you, Big D. So, let me get this straight. You planning to get them all out of here? Each and every one of them! Looks like they're getting the VIP tour. Big D must have something big in store for you two. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? - Big D, Big D, Big D.. - Now what? I losing my mind. We got to talk. Settle down, Jax. Now, what's the problem? They're watching me. Yeah, so? Constantly! It's the faces ... the faces ... Now, here's what you gonna do. You're gonna pull yourself together! You understand me, Jax? - So, what's his story? - What can I say ... Some fish in here just can't take the pressure. You never know who's going to blow a gill next. - Could be you? - Or could be you? I can't! It's the eyes ... They're burning holes in me ... Come on. Let's leave this unsavouriness behind us. We got to talk some business. You two are going to be very useful to me. We're not doing anything until we find the little ones. - What little ones? - Our grand kids. - Have you seen them anywhere out here? - No. Are you sure? Staying in here. I'd know. Like I was saying, you and your large friend here are going to help us burst out. Now you talking my language! And how are we going to do? I'll let you know when you need to know. Capiche? - Kind of scary out here. - Yeah, that's for sure. - What's the matter? - Something grabbed me! Hey! Let her go! - Did you see what it was? - No, I didn't. Oh look. That's a strange little creature. It could be dangerous. You're a funny looking hatchling. I'm not a hatchling. I'm an octopus! Mummy! How come they're all so crazy? - They do that when they are scared. - Scared? Of what? Big ugly fish with giant teeth. Wait for me here. I'll be right back. What are they doing there? They fix you up when there is something wrong with you. Yeah, they do. The humans are all not bad, you know. After all, they help us. Come here. How are we feeling? Oh, roll over. Let's take a look at that fin. Look at you. You are as good as new. We can release him tomorrow. Aww, perfect! Oh, here comes this evening's entertainment. Why don't you go say hello to my cousin for me, huh? Oh, hey guys. What's going on over here? Hello, Tremaine. Long time no see. What are you crowding me for? Tremaine! What's with the trash talking? Wait, a second. No. You got it all wrong, guys. - Don't lie to me! - No! I didn't say nothing! I swear to you on, mother Pervacy's grave. Come on! Nobody ever does nothing. Tell you what. I'll let it slide this time. Family. What are you gonna do? You got to keep them in line. Okay. Enough it is. Let's head back to my place. Who did he think he is? He was nobody back home. I got all the ladies. I heard that! Oh, no, no. I was only talking about George Wick ... honest I wasn't. Tiresome. You're my favorite cousin. Give me, give me .... It's a misunderstanding. It ain't suppose to end this way. - You are tough, boss. - Really drastic! Shut up, will ya. He got what he deserved. Besides, there ain't enough room for the two of us in here. Let him just chill out for a while. - Shhh. - What the matter? We don't want whatever's out there coming back. Annabel! You have to stop wandering off by yourself, sweetheart. Oh, Momma ... Oh hush! You running me gagon. You disappearing all the time. And who are you? - I'm Ella. - And I'm Ricky. Are you going to eat us? Oh no, sweetie. I'm sorry if I scared you. Now, what are you two little ones doing out here all alone? We're looking for our grandfather! They took them to the tank. - The big tank? - Aha. Can you help us find them? Please... Voila! Whoa! Where's that nasty man? Let's move in closer, soldier. Here you are, madam. Enjoy, sir. Do you seeing what I am seeing? I can't bear to look. Suck it up La Motey. And start acting like Blue Head and Blue Camp. Oh, I just can't do. You're making me embarrassed to be in this hero platoon. Assassins! Cold-blooded assassins! Horrible! I know what you mean. Hey, it took us why I had to adjust to. But in the end, this place is not so bad. Murderers! Murderers! Assassins, they are what damn humans are. They're going to eat us ... all of us! We are doomed in here! Pobrecito, must be "lobster" mate. That's one way to get out. Hey, nobody gets a free ride out here. Jimbo! You got out. How did you do it? I died. Okay, that's it! You need to explain. Yeah, Jimbo. You need to tell us that story because we all thought you didn't make it. It was an accident, plain and simple. See, humans come in here to clean these tanks up. I figured if I played dead, they'd flush me back into the ocean. Easy as dead, flush, freedom. Everything was going fantastico. I was thinking I am home and free, that is until .... Hey, hi honey. Yeah, I'm almost done here. I should be home in hour or so. I'm sure I can stop. Can you talk a bit louder? I can barely hear you. Alright, now let me write it down. Shoot. One shwarma. Heavy on the hummus. This guy going on like he was stocking up for the end of the world. Meanwhile I was dry as a catfish on a hot tin roof. We were awaiting for Jimbo to show up, and then Big D found out that Jimbo made a break for it and he went muy loco bit. Yes, Big D, he didn't like any of us freelancing, as he called it. What Big D didn't know I was actually a few gasps from being in a hand-roll. Finally, this guy hangs up. I'm like, wash me out of here already! - But now! Hey, sweetie, it's me again. How many bottles of the Mango Lassi did you want me to pick up? It was now or never. I had to muster up all I had. Make a move. All of a sudden ... Wham! So you were actually dead? - Yes, that's what everybody thought. - Including me! So what happened? Well ... since you asked. And that's my dead story. Whoo! You got some freaky powers, Jimbo. Did you see anything that might help us get out of here? Careful Sammy. Behind you Big D is spying on us. Hey! What's with the gap there? We need to get out of here. Now! Someone getting itchy! Follow me. Hey! You see pipe up there? Freedom, baby! - Which one? - Anyone. You're in charge. You decide. Get in there, check it out. Give me the skinny. Oh, and watch out for them penguins. They cannot be trusted. Then how exactly are we suppose to reach? Volunteering for duty, sir! There you go. Problem solved. Hey, cuzz. How are you holding up? Over here the white stuff is colder than shrimp on ice. Just making me claws-trophobic. Let's go, Lulu, before we all freeze here. Well I was thinking, maybe we should just get off or turn around? Turn round! Stop thinking you wimp! You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Oh look! It's Big D's escape plan, take eight. Nine, actually. Don't forget the sea slug, darling. Just scribbled away didn't she? Yeah, quite right. That it appears someone's taken the wrong turn! But of course! Males not asking for directions? What's new, my dear! Alright Lulu, let's go! My flippers are freezing here. Let me help you up. Well I don't know, long time I've been in here. - Well... destruction... mighty tricky. - Shut your mouth and focus, soldier. No, kids. You have to stay away now. I'm losing my grip. I don't like this. We gotta get out of here, Sammy. The ice is breaking up! Oh, no, no, no ... Ray! Where are you, Ray? Don't panic. I'll get you out. Hold on, buddy. Hold on. It's too heavy. Get off the ice. Now!. Seems rather pathetic, don't you think? To help or not to help? Well I suppose if we want any peace, we must. Tuna time! Sounds cool, Ray! Some plan. That was a suicide mission! Mission! Lulu? Where is Lulu? You're still with us. What say we go down there and give them a helping claw? Stay with mission, soldier! Continue recon duty! Poor Lulu. Oh dear! That didn't sound very promising. That makes ten. But then ... who's counting? What a way to go. But at least he went down with honour on the battlefield. That sure beats getting eaten by some human. What the ... ? By the way, you should know none of Big D's plans have ever worked. I hear you, loud and clear. Thank you. Oh, you're so dark. Yes. Like taking sardines from a baby seal. Yeah, well you know ... he needed a slight attitude adjustment. A time-out. Cousin was always jealous of my success back home. Couldn't stand that I was getting all the ladies. Anyway, I thought it was a good way to break the ice between us. Here you are. So what took you so long? You see anything useful or what? Ray almost got crushed to death. If you consider that useful. He's a tough guy. Hey, where is that looney lobster? I got a mission for him. He didn't make it out. Hey, what are you going to do? Sometimes you get collateral damage. - Know what I mean? - Actually, I don't. That's okay. The important thing is you're safe. Maybe next time. It's not okay. Your plans are useless. - What? - End of story. You thought that was the whole plan? It was just a look-see! That crazy lobster was reckless. He wasn't even supposed to be there! And nobody told him to take a nose dive into the freezing water. You ain't pinning this one on me! Hey, if the shell fits, wear it. You got no idea how to get out of here, dude. Oh, so you want to see somebody get out? I'll show you how to get out. Right now! You two ready? - You good? - Yah, I'm good. You? - I'm good. How about you? - I'm good! Are you sure, because you look like you're coming down with something. - Are you two finished? - Yeah, I think so. Okay, let's see those pearly whites. You serious? We didn't sign up for this. To be clear, Big D, you want us to go into his mouth. Trust me. Get on with it. You, first. Me? Why me? You're smaller, you go first. Age before beauty ... Okay, but whatever you do. Don't eat me. Now clap your trap. Wow, it's dark in here. You swallowed him! Oh, come on! You guys can't take a joke or what? Hey, Ricky, wake up. - What? - The sun is up. It's time to go. Good morning. - Good morning. - Where is Annabel? Here she is. Hi! Can we go play? No ... I think it's time to go, right? Is the Big Tank far? Oh, it's going to take us a while. I hope we find grandpa. I wanna meet your grandpa too! Everybody hold on tight. Let's go. Hey, everybody. You are about to witness my brilliant plan come true. If I had a sand dab for every brilliant plan of his I'll be swimming freely. - I don't see 'em. - Me neither. Are you sure your plan's gonna work, Big D? He'll show up, mark my words. Hey look! Here he is! Well, I'll be. This might actually work. Oh please, it was ever in doubt? - No, never, Boss! - No, absolute, no. Big D is the best! What did I tell you. Was that a great escape or what? It was genius, boss! Pure genius! You've got a flair for drama, boss! They ate them! I know, I know! What? I said they'd get out. They got out. Not my problem. Acceptable. What are we? The babysitters? I don't even like babies. Babysitters ... Bunch of bottom feeders is what you are. - That was horrible. - I don't get it. They let the dolphin go. What about us? Aiii Mira ... This place is too small for a dolphin. They don't belong. And we do? Say, I know ... makes no sense. Every once in a while they bring wounded animals here, they fix them up and then they let them go. Well, we're going to find a way out too. And soon! Ah ah ah. But not on an empty stomach! Yeah! Look at them ... And we thought Lulu was crazy. This ain't no paradise, Sammy. It's a prison. We ain't never gonna get out. Ray ... we have to. For Ricky and Ella. They can't survive out there alone. We've been through a lot worse than this, Ray. Yeah ... you're right. I'm just saying ... What's the plan of this place? Humans like to collect things. Well, I don't want to be collected. I found Ricky and Ella! Thank you. Oh, it's very kind of you. Wow, this place looks amazing. But Momma, I want to help too. What did I tell you? Ella! Ricky! We found them! - My goodness, they look okay. - Look behind you! - Watch out! - It's not safe around here! You need to swim as far away from here! - What's up with them? - They want us to leave? I don't get it. We just got here. - Go, go, go! - Swim, swim! Behind you! Look behind you! They're coming! Look behind you! No, no, no! Turn around. - Grandpa, watch out! Shark! - Behind you. Look behind you! Move out of the way! Get down, she's gonna break the glass! Oh, now again ... Look out! Hey, Albert. Listen ... I just wanted to thank you for what you did for Ricky and Ella. Albert ... You should let it go. That door is too thick. Don't you think I know that. But then why ... ? I want everyone to know that you can't ever give up. You do that ... you die. I hear that, Albert. We're going to get out of here. All of us. - I hear something. - Help! - Is that Annabel? - Mommy! Help! Yeah, that sound like her ... - Annabel? - In here! Let's go. - Annabel, what are you doing here? - I'm stuck. I can't move. You used to get into trouble a lot. We'll get you out. Stop it! - I'm dizzy ... - Watch your back, Ricky! I'm not going to do that again. Ella ... Annabel! Wait, it's too dangerous out there! I'll get mommy. She'll protect you. I guess it's okay now. The bad fish are gone. Ray here is the one who will squirt, okay? So, you really think this plan of yours is gonna work? Personally, I think it's pretty good. - Now what do we do? - Wait and hope the kids show up. That is, if they're not already ... Yeah. I know a way out.. I see them! - They made it! - That's a relief! Okay, do your stuff. Show them our idea. - What are they doing now? - Beats me. Do it again! - They don't get it. - Yeah, you're right. Hey, maybe we can talk to them through the vent ... It's worth a try. Find the vent! Do you understand what they're trying to tell us? I think I do! Come on ... - Oh! Come on. Are you kidding me? - This is bad. They'll get shredded to bits! Ella! No! What have I done? I'm gonna get them killed. Oh no! Can't we catch a break here? Help! Annabel, over here! - Oooh Ricky! - Watch out! - You're gonna get stuck, just like me. - An octopus get stuck? Never. But you? You're gonna get in trouble and all for what? Yeah, I heard that before. - That hurts! - Hey, you! Now stop that! She's my friend. Now go away! Oww! That's enough! Go back to the sewers where you belong. There's all kind of scary monsters around here. Compare it to the humans, they are not bad. You know, I did warn you two about the dangers of the Big Tank. Oh, wait a minute. Where's Ella? I don't know, but I think she just got sucked in! Oh, the horror! The ink ... Of course! That's the plan! These ... it's the eyes! - There she is! - Ella! I'm really happy to see you guys. - I was afraid you ... - No, no, I'm okay. Listen, I know how to get them out. But I'm gonna need your help. No problem. What can we do? I need ink, lots of ink! You're gonna starve to death if you keep on skipping meals. So what's the status? The kids show up? It's hopeless! - Who croaked? - Not now, okay? I heard your grand-kids are outside. That's good. Not if we can't get out! Why am I talking to you? You don't care! - Look! - What the ... ? - Look at that! - Oh, yeah! Those are some smart grand-kids you got there! Ella! Ricky! Yes! - We are getting out of here! - Getting out? Don't you get it? I'm the boss. I decide when it's time to go. What's the stupid plan you came up with anyway? That is on a need to know basis. Huh? And right now, you don't need to know. Oh, yeah? We'll see about that! Whatever. Alright! Let's get moving. Albert, we got squid. - Stay alert. - Sammy, look! Oh, no. Not yet. We're not ready! Wait for my signal, okay? - Time to move! - I'll go this way. We'll meet back here. Gives the kids the signal. You actually thought I was going to let you swim in here, and act like you're the boss? Don't tell me. You're worried about getting shown up? - I don't have time for this. - Hold your tongue! Me? Shown up by some turtles? Ha, I don't think so. You see. It's just not the way we do things. If I let it every idiot with a half-baked idea have free run it would be chaos. That ain't gonna happen. There he is. Let him go, Big D! Your little escape plan is over. That's what you think! Come on, you worm! Don't let him talk to you like that, Marco. Oh, two against one, huh? - Is that all you got, Big D? - Ray! Get him, Philip? Come on! What are you doing? It's okay, Sammy. I'm here. - Good to see you, buddy. - Beat it huh! Beat it. He's right. You're two useless wimps. - Big D! What's going on here? - Oh, look at this! One big happy family. Have you lost your mind? I'm saving all you nincompoops, is what I'm doing. No, you're not. You're trying to kill Sammy. So dramatic! Let me get that off from you buddy. Look, I'm not gonna let these trouble-making turtles mess up our chances of escaping. Escaping? We've got like a zero chance with your plans! To be honest, you've disappointed me. I treat you all like family, and this is how you repay me? Oh, like you did Tremaine? Back off you stunads! What are you going to do Big D? Ice all of us? You are lost your minds! That's right, mi amor. Oh yeah, it is not time to be silent mi amigos. Come on. That plan with the dolphin. It didn't turn out too well. - Did it, Senor D? - What? You sent that poor lobster Lulu on a suicide mission. Hey hey, now hold on! Nobody cracked her claws to go. Oh look who it is ... Numb nuts. What do you want? - It ain't right, Big D ... - Go bang your head. It's what you do best. Oh, this guy is priceless. Boss! No, no. This is not good. It stinks! Let me out of here! He's alive! Boss! You're alive! No thanks to yous! What do you want us to do? Alright, everyone. We're busting out of here. And this time, everybody's getting out! What about them? Even those two nitwit foot soldiers. But what about the boss, huh? We'll set him free on the outside. Well that's good, huh, Big D? Actually ... ... I don't want to leave. But ... what are you saying? I don't understand. We will be free, no? Free! Free! You never really wanted to get out of here, did you? Out there he's just a little defenseless seahorse. Let him go. Alright guys. Time to go. Hey! Hold up! Where are yous going? You're making a big mistake listening to them turtles. Stupid plan if I ever heard one. Okay! It's showtime! Now! Go for it! Yeah, yeah, that's it, that's it! Get it all over you. You gotta make sure the humans think we're fin away from a fish fry. Mira, peligroso. Don't over do it, okay? It could be toxic. What's going on in here? Something is wrong with that fish? - Maybe it's part of the show. - You think so? Look at that Jimbo! He is certainly dramatic enough! Momma, look! It's like a ... a scary movie! There is something wrong here ... - It's cool! - No, no, no, it is not. Let's go, sweetie. They going for it! We'd get out of here in no time at all. Big D! You sure you don't want to change your mind? Oh yeah, boss. What are you going to do without us? Oh, you think you two are irreplaceable? Heh, think again! In any case, they ain't out of here yet! Keep on coming! More, more, more! Good work, Annabel. Mi amor? Where are you, mi amor? - I can't see you. - Manual, estoy aqui. Oh, it feels like the dark cave where we first met. Do you remember? How could I forget? The eyes! The eyes! They can't see me! This is fantastic! - Look at the mess in the tank. - They seem dead. - They're all on the backs! - What's going on? You, funny fish. You ain't laughing now, are you? Big D. The humans are supposed to open the doors. I'm still feel it kind of would be ... Hey, you should have all listened to me. - So what is it? - I think it's oil. - Oil? - Please people. What's happening? The oil is killing the fish. Holy cow! Some of the fish don't look too good. Any longer and we won't need to fake. Hang on guys. We'll be out of here soon. I'm right about you guys getting out of here. In body bags! Let's see how you get out of this mess. I actually like this stuff ... - Plan B! Time to act. - Jimbo, no! Come back! Please calm down. What's with him? - Holy! What you doing? - Now, get out of here. And right now! I'll deal with it. - And voila, problem solved! - What? - Kidding? - Come on, man! Wait, wait, wait ... Free take-aways? This guy is a joke! Enough of this nonsense! Let go of me! There's nothing I can do. There is a solution. You need to open the emergency doors. Have you lost your mind? All the fish will escape! If you don't ... they die. I would get fired. No way! Swing the doors! Do what she says! Open the doors! Stop, stop! I must call the owner first. Wait ... I've got an idea. Happy hour for everyone! Drinks on the house! Free drinks? Ever since the turtles showed up, the drama level around here has gone sky high. I'll wage you two mackerels, they are in hold. Sammy! It's too much ink! - We should call it off. - It's too late! They can't hear us and they'll never be able to see us. Uggh! That's my hair! Okay, okay. I'll do it! Freedom! What in the ... ? - The doors open! - Finally! - It's time ... - We saved the fish! Fantastic! Oh, no! I have to stop this. Here they come! It looks like everything's going to be all right. Do you want another drink? - Shall we order something? - Anything, but fish. I thought I recognized you. Boss! Security here! It gonna stop! It's gonna ... What the ... ? I need to ... check on something. I'll be right back. This is not possible! I need to close the doors! Where's security when I need them? What a nightmare! Holy tandoori! Lobster! So, what are we going to do now, Philip? I always wanted to see New Jersey. You're kidding ... New Jersey. - Seriously? - Absolute more. - Which way is it? - I have no idea. Ooh! That hurts! Stop that! Get if off me! Okay, lobster, I'm going to cut you open. - Get if off me! - Now, hold still, boss. Hey Terain, maintain a fallback position! Come on, everyone. Hurry ... move it, move it. Hey look! There's Consuelo and Manuel. What are you two waiting for? They could close the doors any time now! - We're not going. - Say what? In here it's just me and mi amor. Makes us feel kind of "special". Well, I guess that's one way to look at it. But me and Sammy, we prefer living in the wild. Oh, it's going to be like vida loca in here too with Big D around. I hope everyone made it. You should go before you get stuck in here again. You know we're going to miss all of you. Take care. And tell Big D, that brother needs to chill out. Yoo hoo! Hey! Crustacean coming through! Hold that dang door for us! Hold on, Ray, isn't that ... Hurry! We got to hold the door! Watch yourself. You gotta get crushed! Andale, Lulu ... she's not going to make it. Stand clear and hold on to your shells! Touchdown! A little help here ... I'm alive! I'm alive! Am I alive? As alive as a grenade in a china shop! It's good to see you, Lulu. Thank you. It feels so good to be free. Thank you so much for helping us. Hi, kids! - Have you seen our grandfathers? - Yeah. They were incredible. They're probably still inside, making sure everyone gets out. That sounds like grandpa. Oh! Here's Jimbo! He's a funny fish. - He's playing dead again. - What's with him? Open up those big eyes. Jimbo, it's us. Wake up! - Ricky! Ella! - Grandpa! - You did it! - You kids were awesome! I think we have a problem. Grandpa, Jimbo's not moving. Cram aside! I've had some combat training. Ok, ok. We all know about your dead story. Wake up, Jimbo. Come on, soldier! We're done won the battle! Now fall in. Hold on. I know what to do. Give me some room here, Lulu. I've seen humans do it to the swimmers on the beach. Come on, Jimbo, come out of it! No need to fake it! We made it out! I'm afraid Jimbo is not coming back. Move over, Sammy. Let me work some magic. Gee, what's with all the looks? Somebody died? You did. You gotta stop with this dead business. One of these days, somebody's gonna fillet your butt, before you come back to life. You kidding me, eh? Look at that mook. Lulu, doll. Get me some claw, huh. That was a stand up thing you've done for me back there. Oh, God. Golly. Anyway, it was nothing ... What are you talking about, Berber? I did all the heavy lifting! Oh! Come on. What was I? In a coma? Still crazy as ever. Here they are! - Our saviors! - Thanks for your help. Oh, no problem. That's what friends are for, right? Well my friends, what do you say we get out of here? Oh, yeah. The sooner this place is a distant memory, the better. I need to get back to my baby blue. Do you know what I mean? I think I do. Welcome back, Ray. What do we have here? Dinner time! Hey! Brian! These turtles get a free pass! Are you guys kidding or what? That's some good eating down there! Look closer, bird brain. They're the ones that got me off that boat. I say off limits. Oh sure. My good. Makes you wonder. How you think they got away to make moosh? Let me enjoy this. Oh, Ray, honey! Look at them, acting like kids with a crush on each other. Looks like somebody's getting crushed, alright? You okay, Grandpa? Oh ah! Look at them turtles ... So cute they are. I wish my own mother was as warm and fuzzy when I was a little guy. Oh, I need a hug. You can really kill a bird's appetite, you know that? Big D, Big D, yes, they are watching me! I mean ... it ain't getting any better... I ... Knock it off, you nut-job. You're driving me over the edge. You know that! But it is the faces ... Ooh ... the faces. Especially that one. The horror! The horror! Let me out of here!
