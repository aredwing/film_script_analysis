If I had collateral, why would I be begging for a loan? Please. I'll pay back as soon as I get the money. Fuck you! What did you just say? Hey! Did you just say fuck you? Yeah I did. What are you gonna do? What? I'm a cop. Do I need to get on my knees or fucking beg to borrow 20 grand? Screw you, cop! Hello? Hello! Damn it! - Hello? - Detective HAN! NAH Sang-man got arrest warrant. He had money problems with the dead man CHO Dong-chul and we have testimony from the witness who saw the murder. The trial will be a piece of cake. Who would give a shit for someone like NAH and his pathetic life scraping by doing kiddie magic shows? Detective, it was a good choice to work with you. Ta-da! - How was I? - Pretty good. - That's it? - Come on, hon. You were awesome! - Really? - Yeah. - Mr. NAH Sang-man? - Yes? Please follow me to the police station. What's going on? You're under arrest for the murder of CHO Dong-chul. - Take him. - Let's go. - Honey! - Everything will be alright. Come on, sweetie! Honey! - Honey! - Daddy! - Honey! - Daddy! - Honey! - Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! I AM FATHER You'll really let me off the hook if you get your cut of this deal, right? If this goes wrong, you're dead meat. Come on. Can't you trust me? Trust me just this once! Please! Why else would they have a funeral every month? They're drug dealers. There's no corpse in the coffin. Then what would be in there? Hurry! Hurry! Wow, is this a national gangster reunion? Who the hell are you? Look at this. What does it say? I'm a police, you piece of shit! Stop it! You don't know what I am? I'm a cop, motherfucker! Is there a problem? What kind of funeral is this without even a picture of the dead? Move. Out of the way! I needed a coffin. Want a smoke? Looking at the situation it seems to make sense, but... You're... you're left-handed, right? But the knife wound is On the left side of the victim. Damn it! Did you even see the report? Detective HAN wouldn't even show it to me! I told you I can't pay you back today! Please! You have to give it to me today! NAH Sang-man! Have I ever ripped you off? I'm here. I'll come up. Dumbass. Did I have to wear a suit just for a flower? We're really even after this, right? You won't cuff me, right? - Fifteen grand. - Make it twenty. You will never get more than that. You see, my boss... Stay out of it. Throw in an eye, then. This is my body we're talking about! We agreed on one kidney! - Fine, then. - I can't do this! Stay down, asshole! Scapel. Fucking anesthetic's not kicking in. Give him another shot. - I think he's out. - Yeah? - Wanna watch? - No. Well, well! What brings the detective to a slum like this? I heard NAH Sang-man's at the spot inspection today. I trust you'll do your job? We have good apples this year. What are you waiting for? Show us what you did. Let's get this done! Do it! Stab him! Turn off the camcorder. I said turn it off! Wake up, NAH! Please... Help me... Help me... Took you long enough! Geez! I'm off. I have to meet the director. Wrap it up, detective KIM. I'll take him. Clean things up outside. What? What will you do? - Just get out! - Okay, then. Working too hard, isn't he? Let me see. How can a left-handed person stab... like this... Mr. NAH Let's go talk at the station. Hey, you! Get up, asshole. Ouch, my kidney! Lt hurts! - What a load of bullshit. - It hurts! You didn't take my kidney? What happened, detective HAN? Are you playing with me? Pretty funny! - Cuff up. - Sorry? I didn't take your kidney. I did everything you asked. Why are you doing this to me? You embarrassed me, asshole! Fuck! I'll kill you, son of a bitch! I'll tell them all the bribes you took! Put that away. Or I'll chop off your fingers. Fuck you. Stay back. Stay back! Do it. Stab me. I said do it, you bastard! Hold on. Don't carry a knife if you can't even stab. You fucking ruined my day. How could you? After all that I did for you? - Yeah? - Jong-shik! - What? - Detective KIM's finally done it! Drop the gun, Mr. NAH! Jong-shik, help... If they know about this, I'll never get promoted. Get downstairs. Can you do it alone? Just leave me the smokes. Let's get down! Let's go. Fuck, I gotta quit smoking. You know it. You know I didn't do it. I never killed CHO! Let's talk. Just you and me. Why me? I told you many times it wasn't me. The witness saw you. There's evidence it's you. Good. Jump off! We wouldn't even have to go to trial then. Mr. NAH! - I'll request reinvestigation. - Go downstairs, god damn it! Please come down, Mr. NAH! Get downstairs! Okay. You wanna jump down, or walk down in cuffs? How many times did I tell you? If you're that desperate, you bring the suspect yourself. Or jump. Jump! Why can't you jump? Jump off! You're a magician. Then I guess you won't die, will you? Fuck! That was close. Come here. You're under arrest for threatened murder of detective And obstruction of public duty. Here's the money. Now I want the surgery for my daughter. The doctors said there's only 1% chance. Your deceased father's cornea can save two blinded people. Fuck off. Is she fucking joking? Wait! Hold on! Lt would be a meaningful end for your father... Rock, paper, scissors! Heard you got 12 years. Eyes down! You were just a witness, weren't you? I know it. If he can't find the culprit he can turn anyone into the suspect Whether it's a delivery man or a granny next door. Why the hell did you save someone like him? Why did you? Who are you to save him? I kissed his ass every single time And look what he did. He made me a cripple and threw me in here. Why did you save a piece of shit like that? Hey you rat! Did you steal my smokes? Me? Come one, man. Does it look like I would? - No way. - Fucker. Wait, wait. Let go. How did that get there? I know detective HAN's there. Please let me talk to him. Detective HAN's away on a business trip. I told you already! Please just put him on the phone. Your husband's the one who rejected appeal. Why are you blaming detective HAN? Put him on the goddamn phone! Damn it, lady! Hello? Hello! Ye-seul! Mommy! Why are you out in the rain? Mommy... What are you doing? Look, mommy. DIE MURDERER! MURDERER'S HOUSE - Mommy... - Oh, Baby... Mommy... I'm JANG Soo-kyoung. I'm in charge of Min-ji's organ transplant. As you know already we need a few things to prepare for the transplant. I know this is tough for you. I'll do my best to find a heart for Min-ji. So I hope you hang on in there and help me to help your family. Put this on your bruise. It's Tiger Balm. Thanks. I'm still learning in my job. How long do you think my daughter can last like this? Even if we try our best Two years the most. I see. Hi baby, you're up! This is for you. I bought this cuz you used to like it. I'll get you something else next time. HAN Jong-shik! I'll never forgive you. When you come home Your wife and your daughter will already be heaven. If you even touch them I'll kill you, dumbass! You'd never hurt us, right? I delivered pizza to that house and rot in jail for 7 years! What did I do wrong? What the hell did I do wrong? What's up? Sleep more. I'll wake you up when we get there. TWO YEARS LATER What's up, man? Gave up on magic? This is magic, too. I want my daughter to live in a fungus-free house. How did your parole go? I'm out in 10 days! When you get out make sure to visit your mother. But before I do there's something I have to do. I gotta find fucking HAN and send him to hell. Smarten up. You wanna end up here again? You know what I pray for before I sleep every night? I pray that he doesn't die until I get out of here. I would kill whoever that gets their hands on him before I do, Just forget it. Fuck you. You Jesus or something? Honey? What are you doing here? I'm back from school. Where's your bag? - I lost it. - Where? At school. MURDERER - What the hell? - Police, you son of a bitch! You motherfucker! Long time no see! Didn't I tell you not to mess with money? - I wasn't! - You should listen! Lt's been awhile. Honey, When I'm out of here I'll show you the most fabulous magic show On the biggest stage in the world. Aren't you... Even curious how Ye-seul and I are... Holding up? Give it back! Lt's my dad's! I said it's my dad's! Pass it here! Hey! Give it back! I said it's my dad's! Are you tired? Wanna go home? Come on baby. Let's go. Here you go, princess! Take it to the police station. Detective HAN! Isn't this where CHO Dong-chul died? Is it? Detective HAN! There's a call for you. Something happened to Min-ji at the hospital. What the hell are you doing? Wrap it up! What bloody temper. Ye-seul! Ye-seul! Ye-seul! Open your eyes! Ye-seul! Baby, It's mommy! Ye-seul! Ye-seul! You can't come in. Ye-seul! What happened? She had a seizure. We massaged her heart and gave her sedative. She'll feel better when she awakes. Can't you just stay by your daughter? Hello? Detective HAN? This is internal investigation office. Do you admit the error in investigation? At the time it seemed certain that NAH was the suspect. Look! Innocent civilian has served two years in jail! Innocent civilians were killed in military riots. Big deal! I heard your child's sick. And that her illness is costing a lot... Can I hep you? They proved that you're not the murderer. There are few things to do But you'll be out soon. Does my wife... Does my wife know this? I'm very sorry. Where the hell is her father? Is her father still not here? I have another appointment. I have to go. Really? Then I'll look after her. Oh yeah? Let's do the blood sedimentation test first. Without her father's consent? Damn it. What the fuck would they know about investigating? Jong-shik, Think you're on holidays and lay low for a few months. Detective KIM What's this? NAH Sang-man case. It's obvious what we'll get even with reinvestigation. Just rough it up as unsolved HAN, my promotion will never happen if you're out. I'm sorry, detective HAN. I'll make sure to catch the suspect so all your hard work doesn't go to waste. There's something I didn't tell you about NAH Sang-man's case. The victim of the case, CHO, had money issues with LEE Jong-ho, Gyelim Ship owner's son. Right after the murder Lee Jong-ho ran off to America. Something smells fishy here. Enough yapping. Get going. I'm gonna get the culprit this time. Since you were gone, Your family's been having a hard time, Your wife had been trying to make ends meet But after your daughter died she couldn't get over the shock And attempted to commit suicide. DADDY, I MADE A WINDOW. How are her vitals? They are less stable than yesterday. Her organs are slowly losing their function. Umm... I know this must be tough for you but your wife is in a coma and medically considered dead. - So... - What? Dead? Listen carefully. My wife's not dead yet. I'll save her no matter what. No matter what! - Just half a glass! - Come on, drink up. I still have a lot of investigating to do. That can wait. Do you remember the Mapo serial murder case When you were working in Seoul? Of course. That was in 1989 when I was in high school. I decided to become a detective then cuz I saw you on TV and you blew me away. Don't bring that up. It's embarrassing. You were so cool back then. - Enough already. Drink up! - Okay. I'm sorry. By the time my brain tells my hands to stop pouring the cup's already overflowing. It's been like this since I hurt my head. You've worked so hard your whole life. You should retire and take time for yourself. I gotta hang in at least until my kid's out of high school. Yeah, but you should also think about your own health. But I can't let this go. You still carry that around? Of course. This is my number one treasure. Where are you gonna start digging? I'll start with the ship owner's son. I've already investigated him but there's not much there. But I'm certain this time. There are dozens of people who had money issues with CHO. Don't waste your time. You should just leave the case like chief said and help out with paper in the office. I'm just saying, be more tactful! Paying for me? That's something new! Let's go for another drink. It's too late. I really have to go investigate. Come on. I know a great place. HAN! I'm not useless yet. I'll catch the bastard and get confession out of him. So don't you worry. - Come back to me! - Let's go for one more drink! - Detective KIM! - What? Oh, yes! - Sorry! - You left it here again. Yeah, yeah, Thanks. - Good-bye. - Yup, bye! Come back to me! Long time no see. I heard you were out. No hard feelings. It's all in the past, right? What's that? Gonna take your revenge? I thought you're getting compensation money. Didn't you know? I guess not. Fine. I'll tell them to deposit the money right away. It's not a bad business making that much money serving just two years in jail, isn't it? You fucking crazy? God damn it! Let go, you piece of shit! Lt's all in the past. Never come across me again. I'm not in good mood these days. My daughter... ...is dead. You killed... my daughter. NAH SANG-MAN'S WIFE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE DAUGHTER: DECEASED Ms. JANG - Hello? - It's me, JANG Soo-kyoung. We've found a matching heart for Min-ji. Hello? Thank you. Thank you so much. Tiger Balm works best for bruises. There's a little girl who'll die if she doesn't get a heart right away. - Looking at your wife's state... - Enough! Why are you... so desperate to see people die? You want her to die soon, don't you? Lt's not that... You know why she won't die? Because she's so angry that she ever married me. Because even death can't soothe her anger. That's why she's alive. Get it? Go! Go away! When's the surgery? Um... I couldn't get the guardian's consent yet. When will we get it? We need more time. - Let me meet the guardian. - You can't. Just let me take care of it for now. Why are we here? Lt's so fucking hot. Damn! Lt's been a long time, bro. Why didn't you tell me about your family? At least you're proven not guilty. I got 5 criminal record. This is where I scattered my daughter's ashes. Bro, I'll do the dirty work. You can just help out a little. - You and me together... - No. Still think you're fucking Buddha? He fucked with your life! Look what's happened here! No. I'll do it. I'll kill him myself. Wait. - It's here, right? - No. I told you this is against the regulation. Fuck the regulation! This is a matter of life and death! Please! Please leave. You can't be here. Let's go. Hurry. This is the tattoo of the Vietnamese mafia. Finger print screening didn't work because the suspect is an illegal immigrant. They all gather up in places like Vietnamese Town and set up gambling parlors. Come on, man. How will you find illegal immigrants without ID number or finger print record? Lt's like looking for a needle in a haystack. Then there's the fish trader, HWANG. LEE struggles with the gambling debt he owes CHO. Rather than asking his father he takes his father's boat ownership and goes to HWANG for help. HWANG then hires unidentifiable guys. Geez. Listen. HWANG has dozens of guys. Why would he hire other guys? I would use Vietnamese guys too if I wanted a perfect crime. This is KIM from Serious Crime Department. Print out a call history for me. Year of birth, 1958. Residing in Korea. Name, HWANG Man-bae. - Where are you going? - To investigate HWANG. Move. Out of my way. Get out of his way. Get rid of the guy that stabbed. The almighty detective HAN begging me? - This is quite funny. - What? Since you're so powerful, you get rid of him yourself. You milked me for every penny. Is this how you serve your customers? The leader of the biggest organs trafficking gang in Korea HWANG Man-bae gets arrested. That'll land you at least One liver, two kidneys. And two eye balls. Your daughter's organs still working fine, huh? - Damn you! - Detective HAN Get rid of the guy that stabbed. Immediately. Fuck off, asshole! - Can you speak Korean? - No. Go over there. Can you speak Korean? No. He can. - Can you speak Korean? - Why? Have you seen this tattoo? Yeah. This? Not that. This one. - No. - No? Respect your elders. Never mind. Where would I find this? Geez! What are you doing here? Thank you. Did you find anything out? His daughter is seriously sick in a hospital. - Hospital? - You'll get a call soon. I'm looking for a place to bury that son of a bitch so stay low and wait. I'll make your dream come true. I'm off. Be careful. Ms. JANG. Excuse me. Any news? Umm... We'll have to wait a bit more. Exactly how much longer do I have to wait? You have to give them time, too. Give them time. Some coordinator you are. Then why don't you do it yourself? Hey! Hey! What! I'm busy! They're gonna send me HWANG's call history. What? We'll soon find out who LEE talked to and who HWANG got to kill CHO. Wait for me. I'm on my way. That's okay. I know you're busy with Min-ji. This is my fucking case! Be careful, sir. - Where's the call history? - I'm gonna look at it now. SAVE I'll do it. Can you get some coffee? Sure. Thanks, detective SUNG. - Here's your coffee. - Thanks. - Open the file. - I will. - Fuck! - Geez! I didn't steal anything! Shut up! Fuck! Why is there an open blade here? I'm sorry.

Just pull the god damn trigger. You're good for nothing. Die, you loser. Daddy! Honey! - Hey! - Where is Dr. HWANG? Mrs. NAH is critical! Doctor! Ready! Clear! Step out of the way! Get ready for CPR Ready! Clear! Ms. JANG UNSOLVED CASES What the hell's the big deal about a promotion? - The onset of this case... - Where the hell is detective KIM?

Just look at her! You see that cardiac device? Lt has a week-long life span. If we don't find a heart for Min-ji in a week She'll die. I need a heart. Find me a small one. Blood type B.

Just as long as I'm alive. I'm begging you. You know You still haven't gotten rid of the Vietnamese. I'll make it clear. You get rid of him. I'm saying, keep me out of it. Medically speaking, it's a miracle That your wife is still breathing. Doctor I understand that she might not be able to wake up. But is there a way to just keep her alive? Isn't there something we can do? I don't think she'll make it over two weeks at the most. Daddy. I'll get rid of the Vietnamese. You find me a heart today.
