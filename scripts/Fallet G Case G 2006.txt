Is that Jaan G. Hennan? - How long have you been married? - A little over three years now. - Where did your husband grow up? - In Ockfener. - What's his line of business? - Imports. Objets de'art. Souvenir items and native African and Asian art. And you've been in business together during your time in Kaalbringen? CASE "G" Has your husband been married before? Based on a novel by Hakan Nesser Yes. Have you ever met his ex-wife? - Why do you ask? - Please answer the question. No, I've never met her. She remarried and moved to Berlin. Don't understand why you're asking me all this? Are you sure that your husband's name is Frank Kellerman SEVEN YEARS AGO and that he grew up in Ockfener? Have you ever had any doubts? Hi there. Has he ever been evasive about his past? Well, we've talked about the past... Hello. - Hello. So, what have we got? Have you ever met anyone who could confirm his roots? Relatives... Barbara Hennan. Her husband found her around midnight. He father is dead, but met his mother, at a nursing home. - There's no water in the pool. - Was she blind? met her that first spring and she died that summer. Her blood alcohol level was 0.17 percent, no sign of any violence. Why did you leave Germany? - Any trace evidence? - Just from her husband. We were tired of our jobs. came into some money. Has she been moved? She could have been pushed. So we left. We had vacationed in Kaalbringen and we like it here. - It could be suicide. - Wearing a bathing suit? Does the name Jaan G. Hennan mean anything to you? - One girl wore a wedding dress... - Thanks. Hennan? No. - Anyone talk to the husband? - Just briefly. Who is he? But ran a check on him. His name is Jaan G. Hennan. He served two years in prison on a drugs charge. No further questions. He moved to the US and he returned home two months ago. This is a very delicate case His wife, Barbara, is American. We must ask you not to disclose what took place here. Let's wait for Van Veeteren. Not even to your husband, just to ensure his safety. DeKlerkk is a fool. - The police academy made a mistake. - Let's see what the Germans have. Hi... Elise Kellerman will tell her husband everything. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. DeKlerkk has to put him under surveillance. May come in? won't stay long, just long enough for a coffee. Someone has to talk to DeKlerkk or I'll do it myself... We can't tail Kellerman simply because Veerlangen took his picture. Has your mother called? - Anyone can tell that this is G. - I'm not convinced. She called to see if her gift had arrived. Elise's testimony was very credible - What did she send? - A watch. She obviously doesn't know who her husband is. A nice one? Nice... Don't you trust my judgment? - Moreno? - Where are the towels? - I'll be right with you. That's not the issue here. Munster... asked you a straightforward question. Why don't you bring her along to dinner tonight? I've always had faith in your judgment, but this time I'm not sure. Hello. What do you mean? I'll call... mean, I'll see you tonight. It feels like it's personal, that you hate G. Why wasn't interviewed earlier? I've had to stay up all night, and considering the circumstances... - I'm very sorry for your loss - Hello, I'm Munster. Realise that your situation is difficult, so maybe it's just as well to cut to the chase. I'd like to ask you something: Was Barbara aware What did Veerlangen see? that the pool was to be drained? We talked about it yesterday morning, but she must have forgotten. Forgotten? But she must have noticed it when she was on the diving board? It was pitch black. turned on the lights when found her. Apologise for the early hour, but do you know where this street is? It still seems a bit odd, though... diving into the dark like that. Seem to be lost. Hang on. - People don't do that. - Barbara could. She liked mountain climbing and sky- diving. She enjoyed taking risks. - Are you sure this is the right area? - No. So, where were you when your wife decided to go swimming? I'm sorry, don't know where this is. At a restaurant, the Coloseum. got there... right before eight. - Anything else can do for you? - No. Sony about waking you up. - left around 1 pm. - Alone? The place was crowded, but, no, there was no one with me. - Why wasn't your wife with you? - wanted to be alone. Do you know whether she had any visitors? We've only lived here for two months. We moved here from the States. The Germans have gotten back to us and they confirm... - How long have you been married? - Four years. ...Elise Kellerman's stony. The people on Veerlangen's pictures are Frank and Elise Kellerman. Did you love your wife? - That's not true. - So why did he take pictures of them? guess could put on a grieving-husband act Maybe he made a mistake. ...But for the past year all I've felt was boredom, irritation. Like Van Veeteren, who refuses to believe the man's not Hennan. And, frankly, a sense of disgust. We're talking about an established fact. Would her death benefit you in any way? - What do you mean? - went to see Kellerman. might as well tell you this straight off: Barbara... took out a life insurance policy for Barbara. Obtained a set of his fingerprints and took them to Maardam. For two million. Our technician checked to see if they were a match for Jaan G. Hennan. But that doesn't mean killed her. He found more than 50 shared characteristics. Have a look. So it's pretty certain. - Did you socialise? - They had us over for dinner. - Did you see Kellerman? - Yes. They didn't plan to stay on. Did he recognise you? They rented the house, so there was no reason to socialise. Possibly. He probably did. - What was their relationship like? - really couldn't say. She had a migraine and went to bed. - Anything gone down? - Want some? - Did you notice anything else? - She had a tattoo. - It's been in the car for two weeks. - It's fine. All right... - Are you ready to have a look? - Yes. It's eleven minutes past three. Elise Kellerman is back. - What about G? - He's kept out of sight. Yes, that's her... Thanks. Thank you very much Look at this picture. What does it tell us? If anything should come to mind, please let me know... What are we missing that Veerlangen saw? Oh, a tan car was parked nearby their house. Well, there is a possibility that Hennan told Veerlangen something... - What make was it? - don't remember. Hennan would never reveal anything to a man like Veerlangen. Saw it Thursday morning. A man was sitting behind the wheel. - Could you describe him? - I'm sorry. didn't look closely. He was roughly your age. Maybe a few years older... ...or maybe he just drank more. He chain-smoked. Inside... Bloody hell... There he is... Maarten Veerlangen. - Why is he on record? - He's been a police officer. Munster here, we have an apparent suicide at Wacherstraat 34. What were you doing over at Hennan's house? Was working. - Who was your client? - Hennan. - What did he want? - worked for Mrs. Hennan. The one who died. She wanted me to shadow him, so was on his tail 24-7. Why did he do it? - How long had you been doing that? - Since last Friday. Do you know anything about it? - Was he cheating on her? - Not that could tell. Did you tell him you were questioned by the police? Then why would she want someone to tail him? Did he tell you the police were here? Did he mention a man by the name of Van Veeteren? Did he? She didn't say. But she paid me well enough, so didn't ask, either. - Don't understand a thing. - That's enough. Your timing is off. did get the impression that she was afraid of him, though. Afraid? - Have to know! - Later. Back off for now. Leitner, could you spare me a minute? - Hello. - Didn't Veerlangen work here? Yes, what do you want to know? How he screwed over his associates? Give me the condensed version. He decided to take good money for looking the other way when cocaine was brought in. Only he didn't know we had an agent under cover. Was he a part of the Hennan drug bust? Report to me. want to hear every last detail - No. - Thanks. You're welcome... First, he popped a couple of Imovans. The house is squeaky clean. The only prints are from G and his wife. Then he poured himself a large whisky. So, there was evidence that had to be hidden. Then he neatly slit his wrists with a razor blade. Lengthwise. Take a closer look at the bathroom. According to the post-mortem, he was dead within 15 minutes. Go back there. Hennan has been married before, to a woman named Clarissa, - Did he leave any sort of message? - No. who disappeared on a hike in Denver and was declared dead. - No explanation at all? - No, there wasn't a trace of one. Hennan cashed in 400,000 dollars in life insurance. He took his secret with him to hell. Damn him! - Was there an inquiry? - The case was dismissed. ll would have been better if had killed him myself. They never found her. - Are you drunk? - Of course. - And his wife? - She's still in shock. But she insists that she didn't tell her husband anything. - Found anything? - Drain cleaner. Ever use it? Yes, on occasion... He recognised me, could tell. Someone's done a very thorough cleaning job. It's spotless. Tried to provoke him, make him nervous, make him slip up... The gases created by the drain cleaner will corrode aluminium parts Maybe that's why he killed himself. Unless the metal is protected by grease just can't figure out if he was a coward... like from fingerprints... ...or if this was the best he could do. It doesn't matter if you wipe it off, the print is etched into the metal. So... what do you think? - Could it be an old print? - No older than 24 hours. At first glance, the print doesn't seem to belong to Hennan or his wife. Is it good enough to run through our files? It was a confession. Barbara, the wife in America, and God knows how many others... Give me a few hours. And we'll never know why. It wouldn't surprise me if he knew... This place is as sanitized as a hospital. ...That was waiting out front when he slit his wrists. My wife was fastidious. Still, it's a bit Odd... ...that the only fingerprints we could find belong to you and your wife. No trace of any visitors, Good night. Or the people you lease the house from. But... - have found a thumb, though. - A what? We've recovered a print that doesn't belong to you or your wife. Someone was here last night when your wife met with her accident. Someone who did a thorough clean-up. - Only they missed a thumbprint. - Who could it be? - Don't you know? - No, I'm just as curious as you are. You meet a woman... You make her believe that you love her, and then she dies. You did it in the States, and now you've done it again. - Two million. - You're jumping to conclusions. You have no right to call me a killer. Unless you can prove it. Can you prove it? Soon. I'd like to apologise for my behaviour yesterday. Jaan G. Hennan plans to kill his wife Do you really believe your husband would commit suicide and he's confident he will pull it off. Without leaving some kind of explanation behind? Barbara senses something and hires Veerlangen, a private detective, Do you think you could talk to me? To keep tabs on her husband. G finds out. He decides to move ahead with a modified plan. One that uses Veerlangen as an alibi. - Would you like some? - No, thank you. I'm driving. However, this would entail the use of an accomplice. We couldn't get a match for the print we found. Realise that we do not share the same picture of Frank Kellerman. From the shower? What we need is a print from the diving platform. But still... The entire house was scrubbed down, want to know who did it. Both of us want answers, so maybe we could put our heads together? Munster, bring Veerlangen in and show him our photos. Right now have no idea who my husband was. - Need to go home, Synn has... - Check the phone records. I'm convinced that the man knew... wouldn't have considered suicide. The home number and Hennan's mobile. Did you know him so well? And put him under surveillance. Around the clock. In my line of work, you learn to see through people. Have a pleasant evening. What's his problem? Are you certain that you didn't tell him The girl you're seeing... about your encounter with the police? - What's her name? - Silje. - Yes. - Why didn't you? Is it serious? Couldn't. was... guess didn't want him... Did you meet her at the university? What does she do? Maybe didn't want to know. She works in a store, a convenience store. See. - And he didn't tell you came here? - No. Could we order something to drink? I'm convinced that he recognised me, and that he knew I'd recognised him. - How's your mother doing? - Fine... Well... - Is that it? - She's doing great. If this is really true, I'd like to order two beers, one vodka, a double... if he actually was someone else... - Or shall we have two vodkas? - Beer is fine for me. Yes? - Have you made your mind up? - No... - How's school going? - All right... understand that it's difficult to accept that Jaan changed his identity in order to leave his past behind... Sony, what subject are you taking...? Dad, you're not working right now. Jaan. I'm just interested in what's going on in your life. Jaan G. Hennan. - Erich... - Let's just eat. - don't understand... - Barbara. - Why do we have to get all heavy? - Heavy? Barbara... Then maybe you could tell me something? - Who was the woman in your pool? - That's enough. What subjects aren't "heavy"? We can't talk about you, that's too heavy. How about the weather? Would that be all right, Erich? If take my experience as a police officer and my knowledge of you, and add your attitude to the equation, - Did he say when he'd be here? - No, but he had just checked out. there's only one conclusion can reach: You're back on drugs. Are you, or are you not? - Should we give him a call? - All right... Get up. Check please... Take your jacket off. Slowly. Turn around. Excuse me, are you Erich Van Veeteren? Good. Now sit down again. - Where are your car keys? - In my coat. wonder what ever happened to the real Frank Kellerman? - He's dead, or living abroad. - Hennan was smart. Adopting someone ease's identity is the best policy. That's Ziegler and that's DeWylde. So Hennan killed Veerlangen. Are you going to look for the gun? No, haven't seen them with Hennan. Neither of them. It's the prosecutor's call, but everything's fairly straightforward So you've had him under surveillance for two weeks. - We'll keep in touch. - Give my best to Van Veeteren. And he didn't see anyone but his wife. Didn't get the chance to say goodbye. - As far as could tell. - All right. Thank you. ran the prints from the Kellerman house. Agree with you... He did it. And something unexpected came up. How? He was at that restaurant all night. Mrs. Kellerman's prints were present at Hennan's house. He must have hired someone. - The shower drain... - Elise did the clean-up job. You could be on his payroll. You confirmed his alibi. Otherwise there would be openings. Accepted kickbacks once, and it was the biggest mistake ever made. It cost me my job. Everything was good at my job. You can ask anyone around here. Damn. Hang on... recognise that guy. The one in the background. - Did you see him with G? - No. He parked his car not far from G's office. Take it. His name is Jochen Keymer. At least, that's what we think. No record. - Any connection to Hennan? - Not as far as we know. He's into drugs, possibly a small-time dealer as well. He's smart enough to keep a low profile. - Where would you start looking? - Well... haven't the faintest. - May take it with me? - Just remember where it belongs. Do you think Keymer would kill for money? See you. - It's been switched off. - Tn] his home number. Hi, Ulrike, this is Ewa Moreno... see. Tell him to call as soon as he gets in. Thanks. Bye. - She's been trying to reach him too. - He wouldn't want to miss this. Her car is here. Unless she suspects something, she'll be back. Could you call in a report? We've put out a public alert for both Kellerman and Van Veeteren. Here's a tip: Twin Garden Hotel, Vollerim Park. - What about the chopper? - We need to know where to go first. You'll find Jochen Keymer there. Stop. This will do. - What if refuse? - I'll shoot you and dig your grave. Go on. I'm an old man. I'll go on digging if you tell me everything. Who was she? The woman we found at the bottom of the pool? - Some whore from Hamburg. - What was her name? - What did you offer her, money? - A part in a porno movie. have enough. - That was for old time's sake. - really appreciate it. No questions asked and lots of money. - What had the young man done? - Nothing. - No addresses were exchanged... - Of course not. His father is annoying. So when she went missing, there was nothing... ...to connect her to you. You found a whore who looked like you. Erich... Then you moved to Maardam... But by then you had changed your hair and all... Jaan had taken pictures of her. even copied her tattoo. Erich! What were you doing in that hotel room? - Then what? - What? Did someone...? After you had cleaned up, she moved around the house, having drinks Did you buy stuff for yourself, or are you back to dealing drugs? And scattering her prints. While Jaan went out to eat, tailed by Veerlangen. It was as simple as that, then... Erich... If hadn't taken things for granted, want to help you. If had asked myself who she really was... - Then... - But you didn't. You behaved according to plan. Bothering Jaan and not asking the right questions. Go on digging. Hello. Lippman speaking. Appreciate that you took the time to come. A beige Peugeot passed through Linden an hour ago. - What do you want? - How is he doing... your son? That's enough. Said, that's enough! It's painful to see the people you love ruin their lives. It makes you wonder whose fault it is. Is it your fault? No, no one would blame the father You know, I'd like to see... ...a bird while die. When the son drifts into drug abuse and a life of crime. Could you wait until one flies by? No one has the right to say that. They have no evidence to support it. Isn't that strange? You, on the other hand, can claim that killed my wife. That's all right, it's your job. Was that it? Or did you have something important to say? Was simply sorry that your son was in trouble That's all wanted to say. Damn you! Oh, hello... I'm sorry can't ask you in, we're on our way. - Is it time? - Yes, it started last night. But the contractions stopped... You know all about how the first baby takes it's time. Have a seat. - How is she? - Fine. What brings you here? Listen to me. If you help us out, your prison sentence will be reduced. - No police stuff, hope. - How did you know she was Barbara? - Two or seven years, who cares? - Come on! Give me something. Christ... It was a hunch. Had this... gut feeling So can put those bastards away. Went to see her on the strength of a hunch. If it hadn't been for you... - want to help you. - don't think you can. Well, you never know. Now where is she? - You don't know what the problem is. - So, tell me... - How are you? - Fine... What is the problem? - Here. - What's that? - A camera. That's a pair of binoculars. I'm unhappy... We don't have time, let's go! Don't like life, Dad. You can't do much about that. M - Yes? ay Speak to Y Cu? Erich... love you. Never forget that. We've lost Hennan. SEVEN YEARS LATER Excuse me, are you Van Veeteren? Yes... I'm Belle Vargas. You know my father, Maarten Veerlangen. - See. How can help you? - He disappeared a week ago. People usually come back. Have you talked to the police? They say the same thing you did. Only think something's happened to him. He was digging into an old case, Jaan G. Hennan. - You worked on that case together. - Not exactly. He told me he would contact you once he had more to go on. In that case, he'd better contact the police. This is what do nowadays... He'll turn up, you'll see. Here's is my number. In case you change your mind. Good luck. Case G Van Veeteren here. Hi there. Oh, did startle you? - Have you forgotten? - No... Yes, age will do it to you. No, it's a characteristic of yours. Were you going anywhere? Is it my fault that Erich can't sign this himself? Absolutely not. It's not your fault. But why didn't realise that he was involved with those jerks, that he was in danger? It's so strange... The pain is intolerable... But somehow you manage anyway. Hello, Marlene. I'm Marthe. I'm in charge of the paternity hearing. We're running a bit late... That's all right. When was the last time you spoke to him? He called a week ago, wanting to borrow money. - Did he mention Jaan G. Hennan? - Yes. He was incoherent. told him to call back when he was sober. He never did. - Does this happen often? - No, absolutely not. He calls several times a week and sees a lot of my son. Think hard, didn't he say anything else at all? What did he say...? "Now know how he did it." - What? - "Now know how he did it." - And he was going to tell you. - Any more details? No... I'd really like to talk to him. Well, hello. Look who's here. Listen, could you help me out? I'd like to have a list of incoming calls to this number on the 18th, around 6 pm to midnight. - What's this about? - A friend is concerned about her dad. And there's one more thing... - What do you make of this? - "14.42"? - It's hardly a biblical reference. - You never know. - A departure time. - Or an arrival. - Train, bus, airline...? - Flights depart on even fives. At least, that's what they try to do Could you help me out? Was thinking on a nationwide scale. Will do. Yesterday had some contractions and figured it was time... But they went away. How do you know when it's for real? Well, you just do. Wonder if he's going to look like Erich. - Do you have his baby pictures? - No, don't. - Where are you? - I'm coming... I've got it. - Marlene's leaving. - Oh... Do you have any baby pictures of Erich? I'll get some for her. Here you go... We'll make copies of the ones you like. - Would you like me to call a cab? - No, thank you. A walk would do me good. I'd like to ask you something... - It feels silly... - Fire away! was wondering if could stay here for a while after the baby is born. - Just for a while. - Is there something wrong? just don't want to be alone. Would be very happy to have you here You're part of the family. Thank you. You're so sweet. Bye! - Bye. Marlene thinks I'm sweet. Her frame of reference is different. She doesn't have my expectations, or the same needs... It's an old case: Case G. Jaan G. Hennan... and his wife. Someone pushed her off a high dive. She was found at the bottom of an empty pool. Her skull was crushed. Remember reading about that case. Did he do it? Think so. We had a lot of circumstantial evidence, but not much hard stuff. So the case was dismissed. Why are you involved with the case now? Hennan tried to get at me by using Erich. One of his associates got Erich to come up to a hotel room. Drugs... That was what put him in prison, so have a hard time letting it go. And now some new information has come to light. Figured was going to explore it. If find anything, I'll hand it over to the police. Right... - Of course. - Without a doubt. Precisely. "Arrivals, 2:42 pm"... There are quite a few. Armstadt, Karpatz... - ...Kaalbringen. - ran a check on Belle Vargas. It seems her maiden name was Veerlangen. Is our Veerlangen involved? Is this about "Case G"? Yes... Good. Thanks. - Two calls to Vargas, one from someone in Borsten... Hang on. Borsten... No. One from a pay phone on the outskirts of Kaalbringen. - Well, well... - Here's the number. What do you know? guess a few of those Grey cells are still alive. You didn't answer me: Does this concern Jaan G. Hennan? I'll call you when know more. Take the train, we're expecting snow this afternoon. Hello. May ask you a question? - Are you a cop? - No, I'm trying to help a friend. Maarten Veerlangen. His daughter thought he might be here. - Do you recognise him? - Yes, he owes me money. - haven't seen him for two weeks. - He'll be back. - Where did he stay? - In the caravan that burned down. - Burned down? When was that? - A few days after he left. see... Did you report it to the police? Do you know what started the fire? We don't ask a lot of questions here. Things happen. All right if take a look? - Did you ever talk to him? - He treated me to a drink once. - Why do you think he'll be back? - He seemed the type. - What type? - The decent type. He left this envelope. It's in Geraldine's office. See. Strange... Writing a letter to yourself like that, isn't it? Thank you. We'll search his ?at and I'll send someone to talk to his daughter. - That's all we can do right now. - don't think you'll find anything. But you can try to locate G if he's still in the Kaalbringen area. Wonder what kind of evidence Veerlangen found... How did he figure out how it was done? What did he find out? Well... You know how to pursue this. I've done my bit. - Still enjoy that shop of yours? - My bookshop? Absolutely. Give my best to Ulrike. Call me, if there are any developments. - Why are you still up? - What? - Well... - You can't get it out of your head. Right... It's... can't deny that it keeps popping up. can't let go... - Come to bed, I'm cold. - In a minute. Veerlangen is dead. A shot to the head, he was taken out. Veerlangen left an envelope with some negatives in the safe. Had copies made, and I've studied them for hours on end. It looks like a cafe. There are eight people involved, five men and three women. None of them look like Hennan, but it's hard to tell, since they were shot at a distance. - Are you certain G is involved? - Are you joking? Veerlangen was an alcoholic with financial problems. - Maybe he... - All right. So Veerlangen lied to his daughter about a breakthrough in Case G? He went to that camping place in Kaalbringen to hide out and evade debt collectors. And he just happened to get his brains blown out by someone who didn't like his face. Is that it? - I'll keep these. - Go ahead, have copies. It can't do any harm if mull over the case as well? - What's next? - Moreno and will go to Kaalbringen. DeKlerkk wants us to help him outwith the inquiry. Well, aren't you lucky? - Goodbye. - Bye. don't know how many days this will take. Marlene's baby is due any day now. You know how it is with the first baby, they never arrive on time. - So I'll make it. - We're talking about your grandchild. Erich's son. And all you can think about is that blasted case! - Munster needs me. - Marlene need you! Munster will be fine on his own. - That's not the issue here, is it? - You're right. - You want revenge. - Maybe. This was my case originally, and want to close it. Want to see Jaan G. Hennan in court. We're talking about justice, not revenge. You made a promise to Marlene. She'll think you're letting her down. Am supposed to let Erich down? - Won't be much good at a birth. - That's not the issue... People are good at different things. I'll call you when get there. Look who's here. I've heard you have a stake in this case. So you're welcome to be an observer. - But only an observer. - Thank you. - What do we have? - A dead man. Shot. No obvious suspects. A full investigation is required. How...? We'll map out the last 24 hours of the victim's life. We'll keep our options open, there is no single line of inquiry. - No... Our options are open. - Right. The man they found... - Was it the guy who stayed here? - Veerlangen? Yes. guess can kiss my money goodbye. - Could the police possibly... - He only stayed a few nights. - lent him a grand. - What for? thought he was good for it. He was going to buy a zoom lens. For something important. - What did he need a zoom for? - Birds. - What shop did he go to? - There's only the one. Photo... How about a trip into town? If you can spare the time, that is. To check out the camera shop. - Maybe you should come along. - Why not? Hello. We're police officers. Do you recognise this man? Yes, he bought a 100-300 zoom. Is there a problem? - Did he buy film as well? - Yes, and left a film for processing. - Did you see the pictures? - We use a machine developer. But why don't you have a look? He hasn't picked them up yet. Every shot shows a white brick house and a man and a woman. He used a zoom and shot from a distance of approximately 25 meters. - Too bad they're slightly fuzzy. - Anyone recognise the location? - It doesn't have to be Kaalbringen. - Oh, we're being stupid. bet Veerlangen went to Kaalbringen to develop pictures from his holiday in Sebastopol back in 1988. We'll have to conduct a random search. - A postman might know. - Check it out. Then we might know the address by tomorrow. - Come with me. This is my position: You are not working this case. You are not to follow up on leads. Munster suggested the camera shop. just tagged along. Stay in the background or will have to send you home. Hi there, it's me. How are you doing? Haven't had time to call, I've been swamped. Is Marlene all right? She's there? Please put her on. Hang on. Ulrike... love you. May speak to Marlene now? Well, hello. just wanted to tell you I'll be back soon hope you're doing fine. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
