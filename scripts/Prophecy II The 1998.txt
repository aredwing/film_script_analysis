Guide my hand, Lord, for what I see is the coming end|of the Kingdom of Heaven. Protect and keep these pages|in Heaven's darkest hour. And watch over us, Lord. For Heaven's war|has come to Earth". Thomas Dagget. It's five past the hour, and that means a quick look|at today's weather. This morning, San Fernando valley|residents got a surprise... when they found frost|on their windshields. But things will be|warming up this afternoon.|The gusty winds will be dying down. - We'll have clear skies,|good to moderate air quality. Temperatures... seventies in|the valleys, sixties at the beaches. As far as traffic is concerned,|the SIG alert we had this morning, reported northbound on the 405|at Sunset, is still backing things up. - We'll have to wait|while authorities... - What time is it?|I'm coming. I'm coming.|- investigate that situation. Southbound on the 405 has normal|slowing. However, it has snagged up... quite a ways past...|- Aah! - What do you got?|- Hit by a pedestrian.|Car accident. EP: 90 over 60. Contusions to the head|and neck. Clear this hallway! People, get out of the way.|Are you okay? Yeah, I will be if... Jesus!|I don't know what happened. - He was just there.|- How fast were you going? - Twenty, thirty.|- All right, prep four.|I'll be in in a minute. - You got it.|- Get the door! - Don't be afraid.|- What? Don't be afraid. We'll take it from here, Val.|Thanks. - He's coming! Gabriel's coming!|He's coming! He's coming for me! - What's going on?|- I don't know, Father.|He just started screaming. - I tried to open the door,|but he locked it. Yes. - Thomas?|- Thomas? - Thomas? Step back! Thomas? Thomas? He's coming for you. It's time for you|to go, Gabriel. - This is not my war, and Hell isn't big enough|for both of us. Hey. How are you feeling? Look, I, um... Danyael. Danyael? I don't know if you remember me. I just wanted|to apologize. - I could've killed you.|- Take a lot more than that to kill me. Valerie... talk to me. The monkeys|never did get that one right. It's not "willing servants of Heaven".|It's "winged". So, you found me. This place looks lived in. What about these visions,|Thomas? What do you do? You write them down|on a-a scroll... and stone tablet. I know you prophets|enjoy doing that. Or... maybe a picture? A certain someone? I know you've|seen her, Thomas. So? Who is she? Ironic, isn't it? An archangel needs a monkey|to get a vision from God. That's a small step|from prophet to mortar. Can you take it? - Dr. Parson said you'd sign these.|- Can we do it later? - Yeah, sure.|- Thanks. Ready? One, two, three. Wow! See that? Wow! Whoa! Do it again. Do it again. Be well, guys. Bye. That was|a pretty great exit. I got waylaid. Well, I hope you don't mind.|I had this dry-cleaned. I figured it was|the least I could do. You don't have to keep|apologizing, Valerie. Yeah, well, you don't have|to keep forgiving me either. It's in my upbringing. Well, guilt's|in mine, so... How would you feel|about seeing me again? - Most of the kids|in the ward are terminal. I mean, I used to spend|a lot of time hoping and hoping. And then I just stopped. It makes you wonder|what the point is. And what do you think|the point is, Valerie? Right now? - Four hundred and seventy-two|dollars a week, plus benefits. - Makes me sad.|- Hmm. Wonder if it should|make me sad too. Maybe it should. What, you just don't like|talking about yourself? Not much to tell. I think you're|the more interesting one in this pair. - You think?|- Mm-hmm. I don't know.|That looks pretty interesting to me. Just something I got|when I was young. - Yeah?|- You were married? Uh, yeah. What happened? Um... Well, we lived together|for three years, - and then we were married|for three months. And when he wasn't running up my|Visa card, he was home watching that... You know that|real-life cop show? He wasn't exactly the most|employable soul on the planet. Where is he now? He left. I'm sorry. It's okay. I mean,|it's probably for the best. I was miserable.|I just didn't know it. He was a fool. I thought you were|just walking me home. Would you rather|I leave? I'm not sure. - It's not a good time.|- Yeah. I know. You all right? I'm fine. Do you accept me? - What? What?|- Do you accept me? Yes. Valerie? - Be well, Valerie.|- Valerie? Valerie? Is it done? It's done. It took you|long enough. Michael said|not to force her. Michael didn't say|take your time. Long time, Danyael. Nice to see you again. Good-bye, brother. - Aah! Take a deep breath,|Danyael. It's not too late|to fix this. Come back. Now. As far as I'm concerned,|nothing happened. She was a momentary lapse|of self-control, Danyael. But I'll find her. Don't walk away! Kids. They don't listen|these days. You're no kid, Rafayel. The monkey. Hmm? Who is she?|Where is she? Why couldn't you have just stayed|in the basement, Gabriel? Why couldn't you stay out of it|and mind your business? This was my fight.|You made it yours. My enemy's friend|is my enemy. How many more worlds have to burn|before you're satisfied, Gabriel? Just the one. This one. Aah! I'm not greedy. Hi. I'm wondering if you could help me.|I have a friend... and she got herself|in a bit of a situation. And I was wondering if maybe|she might've been in to see you? We have a very|broad-based clientele, sir. If this was her, um... - Claim check.|- Exactly. Claim check. If this was her|claim check, could you find her name|and where she lives... in that, uh,|whatever it is? - Of course.|- Thank you. This laundry's already been picked up. So I can't give|that information out. - Oh, she wouldn't mind.|We're family.|- You just said you were friends. Caught me. Very good. Martin, don't ask me|how I know. Shh. - Uuh! Your head.|It hurts here, or it hurts here? - Here.|- Mm-hmm. And your belly... la panza...|it hurts up here... or down here? Kind of... here. Well, I'm making|you some eggs. No, the cereal was|just fine. Thanks. But you love eggs.|I'm making you eggs. Nana, gross.|No eggs. - No eggs, please|- Every morning, you ask me for eggs. - Na...|- I am making some eggs. - Nana, I don't want eggs. - I don't wanna be skinny.|That's not what this is about. Pr... I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant.|I have a cold. I have a cold. Every time I skin my knee,|you're telling me that I'm pregnant. - Jesus, that's why I wanted|to become a nurse: to prove to you that people|don't get pregnant just because|they've scraped their knee. So? I'd like to know where your|grandmother went to medical school. There must be|a mistake. There's no mistake, Vally.|You're pregnant. That's not possible. Kath, I've been|with one man. And that was just|a couple days ago. Um... You know,|you're not just pregnant. According to the test,|you're in your second trimester. - Hey. It's done. Oh, it's incredible.|It is. I can't think of a better night|to do it,Julian. If it's the only way|I can have you, then I won't have it|any other way. I put that in the note. That's just beautiful. Are you ready? - I'm ready.|- I'm ready. Oh! I'll see you|in Heaven, baby. Meet you there. Aah! Show time. Anybody home?|Huh? Hmph.|That's too bad. Intensive care.|My favorite. Izzy. Izzy. Isabelle.|Come back. - Come back. - I know you're in there.|Come on back now. Back it up.|Back it up. Hi. Nice hair. - Julian?|- He's gone. He's dead. He's taking|a dirt nap. - Julian.|- Look, I need your help.|I'm short-staffed at the moment. Don't start. - Don't start. I hate that. Please. - He's the cold eye. He's spilled milk.|- Ju...Julian. - Julian.|- Come on. Come on, kiddo. Oh. Come on, kiddo.|We got work to do. Julian.|Julian! - Didn't I kill myself?|- Yes and no. The answer to that|is up to me. Oh, my God. How do you know|he did it? A witness saw your friend rip the guy's|heart out with his bare hands. Plus, he left this|at the crime scene. Somehow, he managed to check in and out|without leaving his name. But we traced him to you|through that patient I.D. number. So what can you tell us|about the man? Nothing. I...|I barely knew him. It's not surprising. Does that ring a bell? Well, he had a,|um, like... - You Val?|- Yes. - You the nurse?|- Yes. - You done with her?|- Yeah. Take her. Come here. - I don't know what to tell you.|- Yeah. Shut up. Listen. No. Really listen.|Both ears. Nod to tell me both ears|are listening. All right. I've dealt with a thousand bodies in|this office. Floaters, crispy critters, bunk bait; bodies you wouldn't|even know were bodies if it|wasn't for a driver's license. - Yes, well, I don't see|what that has to do...|- Don't talk, Val. Bodies chopped and minced and skinned|and used as table decorations. - That's your job.|- You're talking again.|Yeah. No. Listen. Four years ago, a body came in here|tattooed like those; crushed like those;|eyeless. But hey, I'm a sport.|I play along. I tried to determine|what had rolled into my office. But the questions just got deeper.|No sign of growth, no white cells,|no optic nerves. I realized what was there before me|had never been born. - That's not possible.|- That's what I thought. And then it was gone. Burned up in|a flash one night. All the records... Everything to indicate that|it had been there disappeared. Everybody that had anything|to do with that body... has either died...|or gone mad, - including my friend Thomas.|- Who's he? A detective.|Became a monk. - He used to send me cheese wheels|every Christmas.|- Where can I find him? You can't. He's dead. Burnt to ash up at|St. Gregory's Monastery. What do you mean,|"burnt to ash"? You look like|a nice person, Val. Take my advice:|walk away. Don't get involved|whatever you do. Get the lights. Hey,Joe. Thank you. Miss Rosales, I really don't know|what else I can tell you. His death shocked everybody. Thomas was a fine member|of our order. - I understand he used to be a detective.|- Mm-hmm. Well, did he ever talk to you about|any odd cases that he had? Anything dealing with cults|or gangs or anything? - Miss Rosales, I really can't|disclose anything more.|- I know, Father. - Now, if you'll excuse me.|- It's just that... he was involved with|something a while ago... and it's something that I|may have stepped into as well. It's, um, angelic script. According to the old Hebrews, God marked|all his angels with such a sign. Or so Thomas told me. He was|a bit of an expert on such matters. How so? All right.|Uh, listen. This is not something|I would normally discuss, but, uh, since it seems|so important to you. Please. Thomas was obsessed|on the subject of angels. So much so that he claimed|to have had visions about them. According to him, some angels became jealous that God was|giving too much attention to mankind. So they tried|to wipe humans out... under the archangel Gabriel. - Please, have a seat.|- Thank you. The problem was,|to do that... they had to contend with other angels|that were still loyal to God's will. It caused a kind|of civil war up there. It tore Heaven apart. Thomas believed... there was to be|a final confrontation. And if the good side wins,|great. And if not? If not... What does that mean? "Then ash from|a burning Heaven... will cover the Earth". Well, if this guy was|so good at prophesizing, did he bother to say|how it ends? It gets metaphorical. It talks about|the union of Heaven and Earth. - The coming of a Nephilim.|- A what? A Nephilim.|A child born... of an angel|and a human woman. It's talked about|in Genesis six. I, honestly, don't know|what to make of it. "When humans began|to multiply on the face of the Earth... and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw they were beautiful,|and took wives for themselves. All that they desired. The Nephilim were on the Earth|in those days. When the sons of God went|into the daughters of humans... and bore children to them, they were giants,|men of great and terrible renown". So, you're keeping me alive|because you don't know DOS? What was the number? Three-three,|six-six. Wait. What's that?|Something's happening. - Is that her?|- Bingo. Rosales. Valerie. And folks,|up next, a very special item to|make a bright day even brighter. - This beautiful, soft|white and lavender gown...|- Nana? will compliment a new bride|as she walks down the aisle... on that most special of days. This fine quality linen,|cotton and silk dress... will surely become|a family heirloom... - that will last for ages.|- Nana? That's right, Jim.|And notice the fine... satin applique|around the neckline. - Isn't it beautiful?|- Karen, it's really... craftsman work throughout. They don't make them like this anymore. - Nana? Nana? Nana? Nana? - Nana?|- Nana's gone, you know. Nana didn't have much time left,|in any case. In the end, it wasn't gonna be|something you'd wanna witness. Look at it this way. You two can|hook up later. You have no idea|the trouble you got there. No! What's going on here is not personal.|It's business. - It's what I do best. Get out! Monkey wannabe. Wanna dance? You'll have to learn|a modicum of respect. Remember who|did this to you. Go! This is good. Step on it. - Stop! Back it up.|Back it up! Drive much? Try not to hit the dog. You didn't say anything|about me killing anybody. Do it... for Julian. Or forever wish you'd had. Just do it. Atta girl. I'd get the fuck out of here|if I were you. Valerie. Shh. Hello? Help! Hello! - Who are you?|- I think you know. You didn't answer me. I'm sorry.|That's the best I can do. The best you can do.|Well, guess what? Your best is not good enough!|I don't know... what they taught you|in kindergarten, but your best|does not cut it here, okay? You seduce me! You knock me up!|My grandma's dead! And some freak comes to my house|and he tries to kill... I mean, who... who was that|trying to kill me? Gabriel. I must've missed|the trumpet. Valerie, please. - You don't understand.|- I understand fine. You are psychotic. You don't know how|important you are. Let me tell you|a secret. It was revealed to us that|there would be a child. A child born of|my kind and yours. The child that would unite my brothers|again and bring an end to this war. That child has been|given to you. Certifiable.|You're certifiable. You... You... You're probably one of those guys|who, like, goes around... door-to-door selling bibles,|and you and your brothers... You have to believe me. probably all wear white and|you probably have a Web site somewhere. And you probably bake brownies|on the weekend... and you sell them to raise money|for your cause or your cult... Don't be afraid. Sir, did you notice any unusual|activity in the neighborhood tonight? - I got a wrecked car|in the alley back there.|- No, sir. So you didn't see anything,|hear anything. Is that about right? The fact is, officer,|I wasn't paying much attention. See, I was with|my woman. 7-Charlie-63. Come in. - Dorfman, come in.|- Yeah, this is Dorfman. 63, report to|Rosales residence. - May I ask, you fellas use that|to what, talk to each other? - Yeah?|- What, are you high?|It's a radio. Yeah. It's a miracle.|Shh. Do you read me, 63? 63, come in. Dorfman, where are you?|Come in. 63. Checking on the DMV report on the, uh... - Okay. Pop quiz.|How do you make that work? How do you use that? - Hmm?|We have nothing showing yet. Uh, Roger, dispatch. Are we having|a communication problem? What? Take it easy. Come here. It's all right.|Come here. Come here. Don't be scared.|Here. Sit. I want to be with Julian. Please. Why can't you|just let me die? Let's understand|each other. I sang the first hymn|when stars were born. Not that long ago,|I announced to a young woman... Mary... who it was|she was expecting. On the other hand,|I've turned rivers into blood. - Kings into cripples. - Cities to salt. So I don't think that I have|to explain myself to you. You have the child. You'd raise it. Maybe on his first|morning of school, you'd put him on a bus|and he wouldn't come back. Or maybe as a teen, he'd dive into|a pond and he wouldn't come up. And I was just supposed|to accept that? It's how you live here,|isn't it? Doesn't give you|the right to use me. - It wasn't my decision.|- But it was your choice. I never had a choice,|Valerie. Listen, I have to|get you to Michael. - Michael?|- He can protect you. He's gone somewhere|with the others. I don't know where,|but we have to try to find him. There's a book that|a priest gave me. It had... It had prophecies|about your war. It might help you. Where is it? It's in my car. At my house. Can I ask you something? Yes. - What are my chances? Be honest. I don't know. But stay here.|He won't kill you in a church. Respond to Trinity Church,|2222 West in. Silent alarm tripped. All available units.|All available units. - Please respond.|- Wow. That's where I'd take her. - I love this thing. Come on. - Come on. Come on.|- 2222 West in. Trinity Church. Dispatch, this is 1 -Adam-19. Responding to the call|at Trinity Church. Roger that, 1-Adam-19. As soon as the coroner's through. - Can I get an I.D. on her?|- Yeah. It's Rosales. Nina Rosales. - Sir, please go|to the other side of the...|- Shh. - It's okay.|- You wanna help me|out here? Thanks. Be careful. I know you're here, Val. I smell you.|I see you. Yeah. Why hide? I'm doing you a favor. What did Danyael|tell you... about your rug rat? 1 -Adam-9.|Units 20 and 30 are responding. - 35-Adam-9. 5-Lincoln-22.|Report to Vermont and Sunset, code 9. We've been through this before.|My kind, your kind. It's not a good mix. The power of an angel. The free will|of a human. The mothers love it|at first... until the birth. I've seen women rip themselves open|trying to get these things out... 'cause they knew they were|carrying bad kids, Val. Nobody liked them,|not even you-know-who. It took a big flood. I think we have to... So, since you're here... - Confess. Say you're sorry. - Drop it!|- Drop the weapon! - Freeze! Help me! Help me! - Drop it right there! - Gabriel! - Hold it right there, sir! - Freeze! Right there! He's got a weapon! No, wait. Isabelle. Izzy. Izzy. You can be straight with us.|Come on.Just tell us who he is. The angel of death. I'll get some coffee. Nice coat. So what was he up to|in the church? Trying to kill|the savior of humanity. Just ask him. - What the...|- Shh! Loose lips sink ships. Mm-hmm. Yeah. What is that? That's tomorrow's newspaper. Huh? Come on.|Bad monkey. Come on, come on. - I don't know...|- Hah? How? - You don't even know where they are.|- Yeah. - But, I know where they're going.|- Where? - Where? Eden. I'll go get another car. Here.|Just take my hand. This is it?|This is Eden? What man|has made of it. Just her.|Michael wants to see her alone. It's all right. Don't be afraid. It's your tradition too, isn't it? Lighting candles|for the dead? Michael? What a dump! Gemayel.|Long time no see. Would you get|the big guy for me? Don't eat that! Trust me. I've lit far too many|in this war. Is that one for me? It could be...|for all of us. Danyael said you|could protect me. If that were the case, this war|would have been over a long time ago. Are you telling me that I've come|all this way for nothing? If that's what you|want to believe, then yes. I can't believe that. Then don't. Ah... ah. You've done wonders with the place,|I have to say. I hardly recognize it. Talk to me! Why fight?|I'm not here to argue. We're family.|You know what I want. What you want has made you|a walking tragedy, brother. Even Lucifer|wouldn't have you. Surprising, since the two of you|have so much in common. What have I done? You speak to me that|way... How do you compare me to him? Everything I've done|has been for us. I don't want this.|I don't want this! I want it back the way it was,|when... when He loved us best. - Then submit.|- To what? A talking monkey? Obey, Gabriel. Or you'll be|called to a stricter punishment|than any of us ever known. I don't think so. And, uh, it seems to me,|the numbers here speak differently. One way or the other,|this war ends tonight. You think you can take her,|Gabriel? Then come. But your brothers|stay behind. No one will lift a hand|against you. I promise. Michael. Please,|you can't let him have her. Whether she lives or dies|is her choice, not ours. I'm not going to let her|die like this. Even if it means|disobeying me? Yes. This way. - Valerie!|- Danyael, Michael let him in. This way. - Go ahead.|- What about you? It's all come down|to you. Just go. Ah. The honeymooner. The price of freedom.|You know what to do. Come on! It's not that you slept with|that monkey-skin suit that gets me. It's that you liked it. What are you, in love? What do you know about love, Gabriel? It's wrong to go|against your family. You chose them. I want it back|the way it was. You want them? I'd rather be|one of them. - Aaghh! It's too bad. - Hmm. Oh!|- Thanks. It's about time. Nice move. I'll say hello|to Julian for you. You have no idea|what you're in for. Shh. Val, we don't have|to do this. Fuck you. - Uuh!|- Now you're gonna get hurt. Val, it's time to go. If He wanted me to die, He would've let you|kill me a long time ago. This isn't about you. This is about|what you got there. The power of an angel,|the free will of a human being. All I want is what's mine.|Heaven. Have you been? It's paradise. One thing.|I'll let you go easy. Say it. You know He's not with you.|Say it. When was the last time|that you and He spoke? Not lately. It's not that He doesn't talk|to you, you know. It's just that|you don't listen. How do you know? I can hear Him. What's He say? Jump. There is your answer,|brother. So you'll become|what you loathe the most. Good-bye, Gabriel. So, what happens now? I can't see into the future,|Valerie. You're gonna take my child|when it comes, aren't you? He was the only one|of you worth anything. He was the only one|who cared. His child deserves|better than you. I'm keeping him. I'm raising him. And maybe one day,|he'll get on the school bus, and he|won't come back. And maybe one day,|he'll dive into a lake, and he won't come up. I'll take my chances. It's not yours to decide,|Michael. Mom, when's vacation? Well, you have one month,|and then you have the whole summer off. - Can we start now?|- No, you can't start now. - Oh, I never like leaving her.|- They'll be fine. You just|gotta have faith. Oh, honey, just let me give this. - There you go.|- How are ya? I'm fine.|You stay warm now. - Thanks a lot.|- Take care. Why you always so nice to that guy? I think he's sweet.|He says he used to be an angel. Phone's gonna ring. It's gonna be|you-know-who. Everything's gonna|be made right. Phone's gonna ring.
