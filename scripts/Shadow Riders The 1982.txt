"I tell you, if there's one thing I've learnt, "it's the Travens ain't the only family split by this war, "brother against brother. "I just keep fearin', one day I might look down my sight "and find Dal across from me. "I hear little brother Jesse signed up, too, "but nobody's told me which side. "Well, kiss Heather and Sissy for me, "and don't fret none, I'm fine. "Right now I'm somewhere in Georgia, "and since I've been made Captain, "the burdens of responsibility have been heavy. [woman humming] "It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it. Your lovin' son, Mac." You feeling good, honey? Yeah. I hope you'll be stayin' around here for a while. Oh, I'm afraid not. I think we're gonna be pullin' out soon. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. I was hopin' that we could get to know each other a little bit better. [sighs] Well, darlin', I am afraid that is one of the curses of war. You meet somebody and you only got one night to really get to know 'em. One night, huh? I love soothin' a man. [both chuckling] Oh, just imagine these poor old feet of yours marched clear across Georgia. Marched? I'm in the cavalry. All that hard ridin' clear across Georgia. And Virginia. Not to mention Tennessee. Then I got my geography all wrong. [knocking on door] [people shouting] [fireworks exploding] (Mac) Who is it? (Sgt. Ballock) Sgt. Ballock, sir. Go away. (Sgt. Ballock) It's important, sir. Nothin' can be that important. Lee's surrendered, sir. Come in. (Mac) Sergeant, what about the war? Excuse me, Captain. A courier just rode in. Straight from Gen. Grant. The war is over. The men are anxious to celebrate, Captain, and they're waitin' on you. Tell 'em I'll be right along. (officer) Squad, halt! Right face! Would you like a blindfold? I'd like to know why I'm bein' shot. For blowin' up an ammo depot, a train. Of course I did, you dumb knobhead, I'm a soldier. You've been found guilty. I don't recall no trial. [horse snorting] [birds chirping] Squad, attention. Ready. Aim. [people shouting] [guns firing] [all hooting] Hold your hands out! [guns firing] Thank you, Major. I'm glad you fellas happened along. Couldn't let you get shot, Traven. You're too good a fightin' man. Where you fellas bound? We're crossin' the Mississippi. Lick our wounds, gather ourselves, try to get back some of that old swagger, and come back fightin'. I'd like you to ride with us. No, sir. The first thing I'm gonna do is lie down somewhere and die for a couple of days. Then I'm headin' back to Texas. Gonna work the land, try to make somethin' out of it, instead of blowin' it all to hell. Yeah, at least you have a home to go back to. Most of these men don't. Lieutenant. Sir. Bring up that runaway for Sgt. Traven. Yes, sir. Good luck, Sergeant. Thank you, Major. For everything. I figure you'll be needin' this, too. Whoa. [frogs croaking] [birds chirping] [insects chittering] [hinges creaking] [crickets chirping] (Swamp Rat) Well, looky there. [horse snorting] You get the horse. [groans] You sure you want to do this? (Swamp Rat) Well, maybe we ought to talk about it. [groaning] Weren't nice of you fellas, tryin' to steal another man's horse. (man) Hey, Crystal, how about gettin' in here with me? [Crystal chuckling] You should be so lucky. [music stops] How you doin', honey? [moaning] [clearing throat] [hen clucking] [birds chirping] [man coughing] Any law hereabouts? [Swamp Rat groaning] [groans] In my part of Texas we hang horse thieves. If rope isn't handy, we just shoot 'em. Mister, I'm afraid you really went and did it. Those two men you're sayin' are horse thieves are our kin. [guns clicking] Oh, not again. [moaning] Ever push cattle? [both chuckling] Of course not. Well, I'll tell you, sometimes they get spooked. So spooked, the slightest little thing'll start a stampede. And when they get that way, well, a man has to ride a mile just to spit. [chuckling] You talk too much. Yeah, I know. My ma used to say, when they were passin' out tongues, I was the first in line. [chuckles] [men chattering] [moaning] Time for your bath, darlin'-- [men clamouring] What's that? (man) Find us a tree. Nothin'. No, what's goin' on? Just the usual. They're just hangin' some Reb. [men clamouring] Get off of me. I gotta go. Aren't you gonna take a bath? [grunting] [men chattering] [man whooping] What about it, Reb? Any last words? Go to hell. [horse neighing] Excuse me, I seem to have caught you in the middle of somethin'. We just havin' a little fun. I mean, up to now, it's just been swattin' mosquitoes. Now we gonna hang us a Reb. Get him down. What for? You a Yankee, ain't you? That's right. Well, this man's a Reb. A damned Reb. Why you botherin'? Usually wouldn't, except this one happens to be my brother. Get him down. [woman screams] Put your guns down by that tree. Now! [all muttering] Now, get him down and cut him loose. Come on, fellas, it's hot. Just how many holes you want to dig? Down on your bellies. [laughing] Seems to remind you of somethin', don't it? Yeah, only it was the other way around. Old Man Childer's barn? Yeah. I recall his daughter was there, too. And her brothers comin' after you. Yeah. I had a hell of a time pullin' my boots on. It wasn't just your boots, little brother. What're you doin' here? Just passin' through. You? Doesn't matter anymore. It's good to see you, Dal. Especially alive. Good to see you, too, Mac. Let's go home. [neighing] You know, Mac, half a day's ride, we'll be home. Does Kate know you're comin'? Nobody knows I'm comin'. Sure did miss her. I got a feelin' it was more than home cookin'. [horses neighing] (Dal) Where is everybody? (Mac) Pa? Mama? [birds chirping] [gun clicking] (man) Don't neither one of you move. Pa? Mac, is that you? Well, of course it's me. [door creaking] Well, it's a good thing you yelled out, boy. I was all set to shoot. Who's that with you, boy? It's me, Pa. Dal. By God, it is. (Pa) Ma, you better come out here. Take a good look, Mother. They got it wrong. Damn, I knew they did. Quit your swearin', Luke. Dal, is it you? How you doin', Mama? There's only one man in the world with that voice. Underneath that grizzle, it's his face. The army told us you were dead. Oh, son. Mac, give me a hug. [spits] [chuckling] Hey, where are the girls? What happened, Ma? Let me get a jug, and I'll tell you. Hold this. They were in this place before anybody knew it. Tore it apart. When they pulled out, they took Sissy and Heather with them. Jesse tried fightin' 'em off, but they just hit too fast. You mean Jesse was here? Two months ago. He got wounded somewhere in Tennessee, and they sent him home. Looks like you put up a fight. Oh, I managed to get off a couple of shots, but there was just too many of 'em. Comanches have got nothin' on them. They took all the livestock and just about every speck of food we had in the place. You keep sayin' "they," Pa. Who're you talkin' about? Soldiers. Like him. Rebs. You got any idea where they went? South is all anybody seems to know. Mama? You all right? She ain't slept since it happened. How can I sleep when they stole my children? What about the Connery place? Kate all right? (Pa) Kate was here. Came for supper. You mean she's with them? You know Kate, she'd give 'em a fight. What about the law? What've they been doin'? Not much they could do without gettin' folks killed. And if it's Gillette you're talkin' about, he wasn't even around. Where the hell's he been the last few days? I figure I'll go into town and ask him that. Go get my children and you bring 'em back. Don't worry, Mama, we'll find them. Mac, I don't want you havin' a run-in with Miles Gillette. You might kill him. [snickers] Why don't you stay here with the folks? I'm gonna ride over to the Sparks' place and talk to Shorty. Yeah, I guess you're right. Somebody ought to stay with Ma and Pa. You just find out who did it, Dal. Be ready to ride. [horses neighing] [bell ringing] [snorting] Dal? I'll be doggone. Everybody had you dead and buried for dang near a year. Good to see you're still kickin'. How are you, Miles? You got any idea who hit our folks' place? And all we know is a band of renegades swept through about a week ago. Hit about a half a dozen places in the county, then just disappeared. Eh, how many of 'em? Oh, about a dozen of 'em, from what I heard. Armed to the teeth. Had some wagons with 'em. Some of 'em full of grain, others were carryin' prisoners. Where were you when all of this was goin' on? I was down in Converse, runnin' down a prisoner of my own. That's, kind of, out of your territory, isn't it? Yep, a ways. But I wanted to see this man locked up. Happens he was a kin of yours, your Uncle Jack. Dal, even if I'd been here when the renegades come through, there's nothin' I could have done about it. You could've gone after 'em. They didn't leave much choice. Said anyone tried followin', they'd find nothin' but bodies. Dal? Hello, Frank. Sorry you had to come back to somethin' like this. Appears they hit your place, too. Happens I was out at your folks', with Kate. We were engaged, Dal. Gonna get married. We all thought you were dead. Pa said they were headed south. Yeah, pulled out about four days ago. I got a feelin' you're goin' after 'em. Mac's out at the place now. He'll ride with me. Sharp's. Take 'em. Knock the stripes off a skunk from 500 yard. Thanks, Miles. [horse neighing] I'm sorry. She's a hell of a woman. [seagulls cawing] [cattle mooing] [waves crashing] [horses neighing] [gasps] I want to go home. I know, Heather. We all do. Why hasn't someone come to help us, Kate? Someone has to come. We can't count on that. [whispering] We've got to do it ourselves. How? I'm gonna talk to Jesse. Do you think they'll let you? Only one way to find out. Watch yourself, Kate. [cattle mooing] Hold it. How're the girls holdin' up? They want to go home. Kate, if they take us all to Mexico, we don't have a chance. Maybe this'll help. Where'd you get that? From Dal, when we were kids. I keep thinkin' I'm gonna look up someday, and there he is. He's dead, Jesse. I don't believe that. He's too ornery. [horse neighing] I might need some help. I'll be waitin' for your move. Ms. Connery? Get back to the women. [seagulls cawing] And as for you, whatever it is you're hatchin', forget it, or end up dead. (Mac) Horses, cattle, three or four wagons, all of 'em carryin' a real load. (Dal) Yeah, a regular caravan. They're headin' for the coast. Figured they'd head straight for Mexico. I don't get it. Maybe they're goin' for a swim. Well, they can swim in the Rio Grande. [cattle mooing] No matter what happens, I want you to stay out of the way. What are you up to? Just do as I say. Ms. Connery. Please, sit down. I was wonderin' when we'd have a little time to visit. (Kate) Why are you doing this? I have my reasons. No reason could be worth what you're doing. I'm talkin' about the South, Ms. Connery, and a way of life that was taken from us. What makes you think you can get it back? Ms. Connery, the rebel yell was first heard at Manassas, and at 100 battles since then, from Richmond to Gettysburg. The rebel yell is hard to describe. It's a mixture of fear and anger and exaltation but it inspires men, even from defeat. These damn Yankees think they've heard the last of it, but they haven't, and I'm gonna get it back any way I can. These people have nothing to do with any of that. I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. [man coughing] Hey, you, these ropes are startin' my wrists to bleed. How about makin' 'em looser? [men shouting] [guns firing] (sentry) Somebody's escapin'. Hold your fire. I don't want him dead. (man) I'll get him. I'll get him. [soldiers clamouring] (Ashbury) I said, no shootin'. Major! Kill him. [women gasping] [guns firing] (Ashbury) That's the end of him. Too bad, he would've brought a good price in Mexico. [sobbing] (Mac) Great idea of yours, takin' this canyon. It's hot enough to pop corn. [fly buzzing] Get a leg broke. Everything seems to have a bite to it, and I'm smellin' like an old sheepherder. Mac, they got a four-day jump on us. This canyon's the shortest way I know to the coast. Yeah. Come on, big brother. What's got your back up? You ain't said much the last couple of hours. Uh, it's Kate. I never figured that woman to run off. Well, Dal, she thought you were dead. Well, she might have waited to find out. I mean, Frank King! Nice enough fella. Owns a big ranch, runs a lot of cattle. [horse neighing] Always said there never could be no other man. Hell, even if I was dead, she didn't give me a chance to get cold. You're right. Forget her. What do you mean, forget her? She might have had her reasons, you know. [waves crashing] [cattle mooing] I'm sorry about your friend. Go on. You don't have to end up like the others, Ms. Connery. I would like to take you back south with me. I can offer you, a-- A more genteel way of life. You go back there, and they'll shoot you. You're not a soldier anymore, you're an outlaw. I'm still Major Cooper Ashbury, and they'll follow me. What about the Traven girls? They'll end up in Chihuahua eventually. What about you, Ms. Connery? Does my proposal interest you? Nothing about you interests me, Major. I'd rather end up in Chihuahua. [panting] [grunting] [coughing] She's comin' in, Major. Bring down the trade goods and all the people now onto the beach. Yes, sir. Attention, men! Bring down the trade goods and the people to the beach now! Look, there's the ship. (man) You heard the Lieutenant! Don't just stand there gapin', move! Pull them wagons round. (Lt. Butler) Soldier, get these women lined up with the others. Get up. Don't you touch her. [groans] Hell in petticoats. Don't touch 'em, Hardy. Ow! Get in there. Come on, let's get in there. Get in there. (man) Take it right up to shore. Careful, seor. Colonel Hammond, I'm Major Ashbury. Even down here, Major, we're aware that the war is over. It's not for me, or for my men. That's why I contacted you. We're in the market for arms and ammunition. We plan to go back and kill the Yankees. Well, it's a relief to see that you don't hold a grudge, Major. I'd like to see the guns. Surely. Rifle. Lieutenant. (Lt. Butler) Sir? I'll need 200 more, and ammunition. That is not a problem, Major. I'd like to see the rest of the guns now. You can't. They're not here. Then where are they? Two days sailing from here. I've run guns for too long, Major. I make it a practise to see the other man's merchandise first. Then take a look. I guarantee these women will bring a good price. The men I took are strong, they're ideal for workin' in the silver mines. Plus a herd of cattle and horses. That's the grain? Most of it. We have close to a ton. I understand Maximilian needs it to feed his troops, and you do business with Maximilian. I do business with the highest bidder. She won't do. She's strong. She's a hard worker. So is a mule, but it's not what they're interested in down there. You see, this is what they're interested in. Young and fresh. And spirited. What's your price? They're not for sale. She speak for you, Major? They are special. Well, I agree. Blonde hair is rare south of the border, brings a good price. And red hair's even more rare. I'll give you $1,000 for her. Well, what'll it be, Ms. Connery? I meant what I said last night. Throw in a dozen rifles, and she's yours. Done. Too bad. [insects chirping] Get his boots. Yeah. [gunshot] Dal. Mac? At least he remembers us. Dal, it is you. [panting] They said you were-- I know, I'm gettin' tired of hearin' that. (Jesse) Yeah, they were Rebs, all right. Still fightin' the war. Man leadin' 'em calls himself Ashbury. Cooper Ashbury? A Major? That's him. The men he's ridin' with would follow him straight into hell if he called it. Yeah, I was afraid of that. You're right about them followin' him into hell, they would. I rode with him once myself. Why did they take so many hostages? Figured we'd be worth somethin' to slave traders. Comancheros. Sell the men for slave labour in the silver mines, take the women down to Chihuahua and sell them for-- Yeah, we get the picture. The folks, how they doin' anyway? [sighs] Sittin' home alone, waitin'. Well, at least they're together. Yup. They always done just fine together. [waves crashing] How're the girls doin'? They all right? Uh, Heather's scared. Sissy's lookin' out for her, and Kate's lookin' out for both of them. Hear you got yourself wounded somewhere in Tennessee. Shoulder. But it's all right now. Did, uh, Ma tell you what colour I was wearin'? Blue, grey, it doesn't matter. A man fights for what he believes in. Just be glad it's over. Amen to that. [seagulls cawing] Can you ride? [grunts] Yeah, I can ride. Goin' in the mornin'. [waves crashing] [seagulls cawing] When do we go for the guns? The first tide. But there'll only be yourself and two men allowed along. There's the grain and the prisoners. No room for everyone. What about the horses and the cattle? My men will drive 'em down when we come back, in four or five days. You have a deal, Major. You can trust me. I was wondering if you would care to join me. The pheasant in this part of the country is extraordinary. Cooked with wine and sage. You must be starved. Well? If you're thinking of using that knife on me, don't. And if I did? That man out there would shoot you. Thereby making you a somewhat less attractive dinner partner. Allow me. What happens to us now? Chihuahua? No. Not you. You're much too good for that. Why not Mexico City, St. Louis, New Orleans? I'm really tempted to take you along with me, but I'm just afraid that I'd awaken some morning and find you'd made a necklace with my teeth. No, you'll stay here for now. What about the girls? They're coming with me. I'd rather go with them. I'm sorry. I'll be back in a while, and then we'll decide what to do with you. (man) Put your backs into it, boys! (Jesse) Oh, God. Kate's there, but they took the girls. [grunts] [birds chirping] [snorting] [both grunting] [cows mooing] [yelling] [gun firing] (man) Stampede! Stampede! Ya! [cows mooing] [horses neighing] [guns firing] [groans] You cut that kind of close, didn't you? I got sand in my eye. [birds chirping] I should have known you'd come. Yeah, you should've. (Jesse) I told you he was too ornery. Jesse! [Jesse laughing] Oh, God, we thought they'd killed you. If you ain't learnt by now, the Travens are a hard kill. I, uh, got somethin' here that belongs to you. Thank you, Kate. Hello, Mac. Hello, Kate. Hey, how do you like what I picked up on the trail? What about Heather and Sissy? They sailed this morning for Mexico. Why didn't they take you along? They thought I'd be trouble. I can appreciate that. What about Ashbury? He sailed with them. It's a hard ride between here and Chihuahua. And them travellin' by ship. I don't know nothin' about Mexico. Dal? Not much. Jesse? I know someone who does. Jack Traven. You are talkin' about Uncle "Black Jack" Traven? Yes, sir. Well, big brother, you know there are some people who call him "scoundrel." Some might even call him "outlaw." And we all know he's a rogue. Besides, we don't know where to find him. Converse County Jail. What are we waitin' for? [sawing] Never seen old Uncle Jack raise a sweat before. [birds chirping] [chuckling] Well, good to see you boys made it through the war all right. Well, quit gawkin'. It's humiliatin' enough without you laughin' on it. Aw, come on, Uncle Jack, you've been in jail before. Well, I don't care about that. It's the workin' I'm talkin' about. A lot of men have seen me raise a lot of hell in my time, but not one man alive has ever seen me raise a blister. Well, don't fret about it, Jack. We're not gonna tell nobody. What did they lock you up for? Oh, they're just tryin' to make somethin' out of nothin'. I met this gal over in Big Springs, and it turned out she was married. You're in here 'cause of that? Well, it's a little more complicated than that, but... How'd you boys know where to find me? Miles Gillette. Miles Gillette, huh? Oh, Mac, I sure hope you're still figurin' on runnin' against him. I'll swear that man's been after my hide for 30 years, and he won't let up. What did you ever do to him? Nothin' serious. I mean, a man can't even bend the law a little bit anymore. Now, last time you were in jail, it was over a woman, too. Judge's wife, I recall. And there was shootin'. Self defence. Ain't you gettin' a little old for that? Uh, you mean gunplay? No, I mean the other. When I get too old for that, they'll be shovellin' dirt in my face. How about this last woman? Any shootin'? No serious shootin'. We just dropped by to say hello. Well, thanks. Mac, we need him. You heard what he said. Yep, except we need him. Well, that's fine. Except, how we gonna get him out? I mean, it's a jail. Got any ideas? Yeah. [crickets chirping] (Jesse) Come on, Uncle Jack, we gotta get out of here. [Jack coughing] Come on, Uncle Jack. Well, did you have to use two sticks of dynamite? [horse neighing] Hello, Kate. Hello, Jack. Brought your horse. Oh, thank you. Glad to see you're still alive. Well, thank you. Take a look at these wrinkles and these here grey hairs. Every one of 'em earned. [chuckling] [clicking tongue] Well, I sure do appreciate you boys bustin' me out. I hope nobody back there got a good look. I gotta be loco. Blowin' up a jail! (Jack) By the way, where we bound? Mexico. You do know the country down there, don't you? I know more about that country than a jackrabbit knows about runnin'. Every trail, back trail, cantinas, bawdyhouses. We're not exactly goin' down there sightseein', Jack. We ain't? Then why? (Jesse) Mac, Dal, better get up here! Right out there. (Jack) Who the hell are they? I'd say that's gotta be a posse. Looks like they're in a hurry. Uncle Jack, have you been tellin' us everything? What do you mean? I mean, by the way they're ridin', you left out somethin'. Yeah, it might be that fella I shot over in Waco. You mean you killed someone? (Jack) No, it's worse. His father was the mayor. I don't want to hear anymore. If they catch up to us, my chances of runnin' for office are dead. You hear me? Dead! You could always start over. That's Miles Gillette leadin' 'em. What's he doin' along? Maybe he heard you're fixin' to run for sheriff. Why is the Sheriff of Big Springs chasin' after you for somethin' you did in Waco? Well, Mac, you know how that old turkey's had it in for me all these years. If you keep jawin', they're gonna catch up to us. No, because in a few hours we'll be at the Rio Grande. When we cross that, we'll be in Mexico. Come on. It's your men? My welcoming committee. I don't see any sign of the rifles. We have a system here. You see those wagons? They're to transport the grain and the prisoners to the train. Train? The train that will take us to Chihuahua. Your rifles are on that train. How far? Half a day's journey from here. (man) Hey, Carlos, what do you think of this pretty blonde girl here? [man exclaiming] [people chattering] [men grunting] [birds chirping] [insects chittering] Where is Jack? He was supposed to be keepin' watch, but he disappeared. (Dal) Where's Mac? Lookin' for Uncle Jack. [sighs] Here, I brought you a little drink. Where you been? There's a village back there, and you know they got some girls there that would just-- That posse's in sight. Best get goin'. You still haven't told us why that posse isn't lettin' up. Well, it must be that other thing. What thing? Well, it wasn't my fault. I was just drinkin' a lot of whiskey and-- Whiskey gets the blame for a lot of things it didn't do. Come on. (Jack) Hold on to that tequila. [men grunting] [man laughing] [people chattering] [exclaims] [woman chattering] Unload everything. (Hammond) Put them all in the stockade! And I mean all of 'em. [girls screaming] (girl) No, no! All right, get down. Move! [men clamouring] [girls screaming] [men chattering in Spanish] [girls crying] [horses approaching] No sign of 'em. Good. I best get back up there and keep a lookout. (Mac) Good thing they let up. Horses need a rest. (Dal) Yeah, could be they're doin' the same thing. How you makin' out? I'm doin' fine. [sighs] Kind of warm. Hey, Kate. How did you manage to get so friendly with Frank King? What do you mean? The two of you're engaged. I'd say that's gettin' pretty friendly. I heard you were killed. What was I supposed to do? You always said you'd wait for me. Wait? I waited for you most of my life. Like I said, I heard you were dead. Well, I ain't dead. I never got word otherwise. Same as when you left, not a word. There was a war goin' on. You know, sometimes a man's gotta do-- What he has to do. Well, sometimes a woman does, too and I'm a woman, Dal Traven, not a martyr. I just thought you always knew I'd be comin' back. How was I supposed to know? I thought that's the way it was meant to be. You thought? Why didn't you ever ask me? Ask you? Ask you what? Oh, why didn't you ever ask me what Frank King asked me? [crying] Hey, Dal, while you're down there tryin' to figure out the female race, you might as well take a bath. Those two gotta be loco. I think they call that love, little brother. Amounts to the same thing, don't it? How's your love life? [exclaims] Not me. Since I've been home, I spend my time with the folks helpin' with the ranch. What about your schoolin'? I figured I'd pick that up again when we get back. Well, that's good to hear. We Travens got a lot of faults, but bein' ignorant ain't one of them. Especially havin' a big brother aimin' to run for governor. No. That just sounds good to the ladies. [laughing] You sure did leave an awful big footprint, Mac. Listen, you just be yourself, Jesse. So far, I'd say you're doin' just fine. I just realized Holiday Hammond's hangout's over that next ridge. I know those boys up there, and I can ride in. But they'll probably shoot you. You mean, there's nobody else they'd let pass through there besides thieves and killers? Oh, no offence. Do you mind tellin' me how you're gonna get the rest of us in there without us endin' up in a funeral procession? Well, there's a mission over here a little ways. I figured I'd ride over there and say a prayer for you boys. What'd he say? Said he was gonna take up prayin'. You best go with him. Amen. Hey, where'd you get that? I borrowed them. You mean stole. They don't sell 'em, you know. You gonna borrow him, too? Here, you best take these and we best quit jawin' and get out of here. [both laughing] [woman speaking Spanish] [Hammond chattering] Colonel, I would like to see those guns now. Why, what's your hurry? Enjoy the festivities. I have kept my end of the bargain. Maana, maana. Now! I want to see them now! [gun clicking] The Major said now. Right now? Right now. You have been double-dealin' from the start, Colonel. That's right, Major. But, you see, that's the risks you take when you deal with the likes of me. Lock him up. What the hell's goin' on here? Kate's goin' in there and lend a little comfort to the prisoners. Prisoners? You mean you want to send her in there alone? Well, it's gonna take at least three of us, Dal. That's the only way I know how to get us in. Why does it have to be Kate? Well, you'd look pretty foolish in this getup. Dal, don't forget Ashbury's in there. Now, he knows you and he knows Jesse. Now I figure Uncle Jack knows what he's sayin'. It's gonna take three of us inside. That leaves me, Jack, and Kate. Well, Ashbury knows Kate, too, you know. Not in that outfit he don't. I don't want her goin' in there. Well, what about what I want? I've been with this thing a lot longer than you have. Heather and Sissy are in there. How else are we gonna get them out? We'll find another way. Come on, Dal. What do you say let's take a little ride? Jesse, why don't you go take that Sharp's off my horse? The way this is goin', you're gonna need it more than me. [donkey braying] Don't go hard on him, Kate. I'm afraid he inherited that ornery streak from Pa. I never seen your pa ride hard on your ma. Oh, he tries. He tries, but she just fights right back. Just like you do. They ended up havin' a pretty good thing. That's all I want. Well, if you can tolerate him, you'll have it. Kate, he needs you, you know that. You're right, he does need me, but he doesn't know it. I think he does. Hell, you know him as well as I do. He cares. I think he cares a lot, he just... He--he don't know how to say it. Well, isn't it about time he learnt? Well, it's not his way, but I'll tell you somethin', I'd be willin' to bet, you stick with him, he'll learn. What about you? Kate, you sure you're gonna be all right goin' in there alone? Don't worry, Mac. Even if they find me out, they probably won't hurt me. You didn't answer my question. What about you? Goin' in there alone, I mean, that's risky. You always do that. What? Change the subject when things get too close. Oh. [snickers] You think you got me figured out, don't you? Well, that's not gonna work, see, because I'm not talkin' about me, I'm talkin' about Dal. Now, I think he's actin' the way he is-- What is it with you Traven boys? Oh. I got the feelin' you're fixin' to make a point. Dal can't say how he feels about a woman, and you run from it. I'm not runnin'. I mean, Kate, you know how it is. You know... Well, I am runnin', I'm--I'm runnin' for sheriff. There is no room in my life right now for a woman. The trouble with you, Mac Traven, is you're gun-shy. Well, let me put it this way. Somebody like you comes along, I might consider it. Now cool down. [chuckles] [birds chirping] It's like a damn hornet's nest down there. If you got a plan, Jack, you better be lettin' me in on it. You know, you never asked me how I got this tequila. How? Stole it. Just like I did this. I got a plan. Quit worryin' about that woman, will you? She's a tough one, and smart. You know that. And when the shootin' starts, she'll be there to look after the girls. We'll take care of her, Dal. That's a promise. I'm gonna hold you to it. [hens clucking] You looking for someone? I heard at the mission some women were brought in. I'd like to see them. This is not a good place for you. Take me to them, please. Then come. How you boys doin'? Haven't seen you for a while. Figured either a lawman or a husband finally got you. There's a few of them chasin' me, I guess. Who's he? This is my nephew. (man) Go on through. That wasn't too hard. Sister, will you pray for me? Of course, my child. [men chattering] I'm Sister Katherine. Uncle Jack, now I know you got a plan, but don't you think you ought to fill me in? Here, you might need this. Kate! [shushing] Mac is here. So's Jesse and Dal. You mean they're alive? They're goin' to get you out of here. [chain rattling] You're intruding, sir. I'm sorry, Sister. But I couldn't help noticing, despite the habit, that you're quite young. And now I can't help wondering what you'd look like without that outfit. I am a nun. Have you no conscience? Not when there's a profit in it. [screams] Hello, Kate. Welcome to Mexico. [all laughing] You all know what the old maid said to the cowpuncher, don't you? (man) No. You tell 'em, Uncle Jack. Come on, amigos. It's been a long, hard trail, and I'm buyin'. [all cheering] [men shouting] Damn, it won't take forever for that posse to get here. What're they waitin' on? Jack said to wait for his signal. What signal? Said we couldn't miss it. [man speaking in Spanish] (man) Come on, amigo! Hold on. I'll be right there. [horses neighing] I reckon that's Uncle Jack's signal. I'll take the one on the left. Got you. [guns firing] Bring her to my car. Them, too. (Heather) No! [guns firing] [men coughing] [men clamouring] [neighing] Thanks, Uncle Jack. Here come Dal and Jesse. Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go. [grunting] Tell the engineer to get movin', now! [grunting] I'm gonna get the girls. (Jack) Find the girls. Hi, Uncle Jack. [hissing] [squealing] Where's the Travens? (women) On the train. Get down! Get down! [train engine chugging] [neighing] [panting] Thank God you're alive. Get back. Where's Kate and the girls? By God, I ought to kill you for what you done to my family. Then do it. This killin's got to stop somewhere. I recall this belongs to you. Makes us even, Major. Dal, Hammond's got the girls and Kate on the train. [man shouting] (man) Looks like somebody started a war. [men chattering] (man #2) Everybody's dead? (man #3) There's gotta be somebody around here. [screaming] (Kate) Mac, watch out! Mac, watch out! [horse neighing] [train horn blowing] We'll be getting into Chihuahua tonight. Perhaps the day after you'd care to go on into Mexico City. Colonel Hammond, are you going to keep the brandy all to yourself? Why, no. No, not at all. Please sit down. [men grunting] [yelling] Stop this train. Do it now! [brakes screeching] [wheels squealing] [whistle blowing] [hens clucking] [birds chirping] Whoa, cowboy. Jack Traven! [in Spanish accent] I ain't seen him. [horse nickering] [train horn blowing] [engine hissing] (Sissy) Jesse! [Heather and Sissy laughing] Jessie! You all right? Yes, you? Stay here. [horse snorting] You boys are in enough trouble. You best get out of the way. Sorry, Sheriff, can't do that. We want Jack. Now, I know why you boys come down here. I'm sorry for what happened to your family, but I got a job to do. Jack Traven is goin' back to Texas. We're all goin' back to Texas. Uncle Jack's ridin' with us. You boys busted your Uncle Jack out of jail. Now, I'm willin' to let that slide. You ain't got no authority down here. What'd he do anyway? What'd he do? This man's a horse thief, a renegade, a double-dealin', lyin', womanizin'-- Womanizin' ain't against the law. Go on, tell 'em, Gillette, how you been settin' on your rump for all these years, all of a sudden you start chasin' me till I about turned into raw meat. You just been runnin' loose too long. There's more to it than that. You tell them, or I will. I'll carve your tongue out, Jack. You better tell us, Miles. He's been after my wife. [man snickering] [man coughing] That ain't all of it. That wife of yours has been chasin' me for years, and I just got tired of runnin'. I--I caught 'em together. And I'm takin' him in. You take one Traven, you gotta take 'em all. Sorry it had to come to this. Maybe it doesn't have to. Make you a trade, Sheriff. Holiday Hammond for "Black Jack" Traven. Hammond's a big fish compared to Uncle Jack. Mean a lot more to you fellas ridin' back into Texas with Holiday Hammond in tow. Been on the wanted list almost 20 years. (Jesse) Most wanted man in Texas, the way I hear it. You boys got yourself a trade. You'd have loved Mexico City. Maybe, but you'd never have seen it alive. Kate, I might have died a happy man. Jack Traven, I don't want to ever see you around Big Springs again. Afraid you got no say in the matter, Gillette. See, I'm gonna be the next sheriff of Big Springs. See you at the polls. Give my regards to your wife. [Jack laughing] Jack Traven for Holiday Hammond. You boys sure did get the best of that trade. That's a matter of opinion. Upsy-daisy. Sorry. [both laughing] Got room for one more? You mean you're tradin' in your horse for a wagon ride? Yeah, well, I got somethin' I want to ask you. [Heather giggling] Let's go home. Giddyap! [Heather and Sissy giggling]
