This isn't what I think it is, is it? No. As long as you're all right. Why wouldn't I be? What do you think? Please tell me that's not for the wedding. Brad's mom will have an aneurysm. It's for tonight. Do you think it's too slutty for a second date? Depends on whether or not you've already slept with him. Promise me that whatever you do buy for the wedding, there'll be a little bit more of it. Hey, did you book your flights yet? No. It's two weeks away. I know! I was just waiting for you to be sure. Sure about what? {just want you to be happy, okay? I am happy. I am. All right. ('H book a refundable ticket. Really? I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Look at it this way. Two weeks from now, this will all be over, and all you'll have to worry about is whether four weeks in Europe is really enough time to see everything. When will you get in? About same time tomorrow, if I go straight through. Love you. Bye. Bye. Hey, it's me. I guess you're stiff on the road. {just wanted to check in, see how you are. Look, honey, I really appreciate you going along with this, just like you always do. I mean, believe me, I'm as bummed as you are that! gotta cancel our honeymoon, but a huge deal's come up at work and... Anyway, take care of my car for me and I will make it up to you, I promise. We'll go somewhere better, like Hawaii or somewhere in a few months. But right now Fm just thinking of our wedding, and Pm waiting for you here in Denver. I know this keeps... Ella. Shit. Shit. Shit. Fuck you, Brad. Nice. Hi. Fuck. Shit. Sorry. Fuck. Having some trouble? No. I'm fine. No. I meant with your truck. Right. Um... Yeah, it just kind of died on me. That's inconvenient. Want some help? I tried calling AAA, but there's no service. Well I... I'd offer to let you borrow my phone, but I don't have one. Really? Um, okay. Well, why don't I take a look, see what we're dealing with? Long way from home. Where you heading? Denver. When was the last time you had her serviced? It's not my car. No? You steal it? That depends. Are you a cop? Okay. Well. It doesn't seem to be an oil problem. No, I, checked the oil. The belt is tight, and I, saw the connection on the battery is good, too, so. Not making it easy for me to save the day here. Sorry about that. Have you been walking a long way? I mean, do you live out here? No, I used to come out here with my dad, and now I just come out when I can and go hiking. Okay. I still have one more move. Something my dad taught me, actually. Do you mind if I check the trunk? It's right here. Turn the ignition like you're turning it on. Yeah, it's on. Okay. My gosh. Yes! I am very impressed. I don't know what I would have done without you, so... No, don't mention it. Here. Can I... I mean, can I give you money or... No, listen. Your thanks is thanks enough, honestly. And from the looks of it, you're gonna need it a lot more than I do with a wedding and a honeymoon to pay for. So. Well, um... It was nice meeting you. I'm Christian. Mallory. Mallory. That's a very pretty name. Um... Thank you. Yeah, you got it. Drive safe. I would offer you a ride, but... No, it's totally fine. I got everything I need right here. Anyway, I get it. Thank you. You sure about this? I can only take you as far as the highway, but, yeah. Okay. I'd have felt guilty the rest of the drive. Besides, you seem nice enough. You don't know me that well yet. I'll take my chances. Do you mind? Signal's terrible, but the CD works. You can tell a lot about people by what they listen to. Wow. Yeah, it's a mix. My sister made it for me. Kind of to poke fun. I don't know what you mean, I love this song. Right? How can you not? She's back at home, your sister? She's finishing law school back in San Francisco. That must have been tough to leave her. Yeah. She'll be all right. She is the perpetually single type. Different guy every month. No ties. Do you have her number? Sure. But then you'd have to get a phone. Yeah, the thing she didn't really realize was that she was stuck. After our parents passed away, she was just... Sorry. No, no. Don't be. Feels like you need to tell someone. Might as well be a stranger you're never gonna see again. What about you? What about me? You can't always have been a hobo. No. Hey, where are you guys going on your honeymoon? Italy. Brad's boss has a house there. That's lucky. Yeah. Tell me about him. Brad? Yeah. He's great. He's smart. Interesting. Driven. On our first date, he rented out the entire restaurant and said he didn't want anybody disturbing our first chances of getting to know each other. So. He sounds like quite a guy. Yeah, it wasn't as lame as that sounded. No, I'd... Listen, it... You wouldn't be here if it was. Moving across the country. Giving up everything just to be with him. You're almost rid of me. Last chance to get on the freeway for about 50 miles. I never asked where you were heading. Next town over. There's a little motel there. Quiet, inexpensive. As good a place as any to spend the night. Is it far? Not by car, no. Why do you ask? Just wondering. Thinking I could use a break. Maybe grab a bite to eat. You don't need to be on your way? Not yet. It's interesting, isn't it? All this. You driving through here on this particular day at that particular time. Breaking down right where you did. It's incredible, really, when you think about it. All the things that have to occur in sequence, all for two strangers to meet. You know, you make one different decision, you take a different fork in the road, and then two people just pass each other by. But yet, here we are. Is it all chance? Simple serendipity? Or is it something more? Fate? Destiny? Don't worry. I'm not flirting with you. Honestly. I don't think you could deep throat my huge cock anyway. I'm kidding. It's not that big. I think you could do it. With that mouth, I might even enjoy it. That's not funny. I think you should get out. What? Did I say something wrong? Did I spoil the mood? Please, I'm asking nicely. Get out. No, no, no, no, no. We're gonna go on a nice little drive. I can drive the rest of the way on my own, but believe me when I tell you, it'd be a lot less fun for both of us. The door, please. Why are you doing this? Doing what? I didn't force you to stop. You pulled over and invited me in. And even then, even after you'd done your good deed and taken me as far as you could, you still wouldn't let me out. Maybe that's some subconscious attempt to sabotage a marriage you don't really want, or maybe it's fate. Either way, it doesn't seem right for you to blame me. Gas pedal's the one on the right. Where are you taking me? I told you. A little motel down the road. Don't worry, there won't be anyone there to disturb us. It's been abandoned for years. Suit yourself. We'll be there before sundown. God, that's annoying. No! No! Shit! Shit! Shit. That was new. I do believe I may ache a little come the morning. Awful lot of blood you got there. I guess you missed your femoral artery, because, frankly, you'd be dead by now. I don't think you realize how much trouble you're in. Nice knowing you, Mallory. You're on your own now. No, no, no. Please, please. Please. Please, please, don't. Where's my phone? Help! Help! Help! Help! Please, somebody! Help! Help! Help, I'm down here! Help! Somebody help! Help! Somebody, please! Help! Help! Help! I'm down here! Shit! Don't you want to know where I've been? Found a cabin a few miles downriver. A family place. No one home, unfortunately, and no phone. But by the looks of it, someone will be back soon. In the meantime... How have you been? Couldn't have been easy, out here all alone. I gotta ask. Why'd you do it? Drive off the road like that. Must have had a reason. Did you think I was gonna rape you? You've been reading too many stories, Mallory. Let's be honest. If I wanted to get into that little box of yours, I wouldn't have needed to rape you. You were there. Ten miles and a smile from following me into a motel room. You're wrong. Am I? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? I need water. And food. What do you want? Let's start with... A story. About what? I don't know. How about the first time you got fucked? You have been fucked before, haven't you? If you'd rather not... Wait! Wait! Theo. His name was Theo. Of course it was. And, where did you meet this Theo? On vacation. When you were... Seventeen. Was it just the one night? And he was older? What'd he do to you? What do you think? Everything. And you liked it? Did he make you come? How many times? A lot. You still think about him? Do you think about him touching you? About having him inside of you? Yes. Do you touch yourself? Yes. No, you don't. Nice try, though. Really. You almost had me going. It was Ella, wasn't it? Theo, the guy. That was her story. You should know you can't fool me, Mallory. Boy. No, no, no, no, please, please! Shit! You shouldn't just tell people what they wanna hear, Mallory. Try being yourself. Help, I'm down here! Help! I'm here, somebody! Help! My name is Mallory Rutledge. Kick back and unwind with non-stop relaxing music... Last one, my fucking ass. Shit! Fuck you. Okay. Okay. Fuck! Morning, sunshine. Shit. Beautiful day, isn't it? Hey, sorry it took me so long to get back. Things got a little crazy at the cabin. Bill and Sue finally got back with their son and granddaughter, and I decided to throw them an impromptu welcome home party. You know, I'd have brought you some cake, but I didn't think you'd like it much. Katie's a sweet kid, but she isn't much of a baker. Besides, looks like someone had a party of their own last night. Still, you're learning. I'm proud of you. You're starting to fight. What's in it? This and that. You see, I was doing a little work, fixing that sign you hit. Making sure no one else would accidentally end up down here. Might be there's something you can use. In that case... Give me that, you bitch! No... Shit! No! Let go! Get the fuck away from me! God damn it! Fuck! No, Ella! Help, Ella! Ella! Help! You're too late. I already called the police. They know where I am! No, you didn't. That's not what your phone says. What are you gonna do to me? To you? Nothing. Not yet, at least. For now, I'm just enjoying the show. Please, just let me go. Now where would be the fun in that? You don't get it, do you, Mallory? No one is coming to save you. You're on your own. If you want out, you're gonna have to get yourself out. Now, as much fun as this has been, I really should be going. Get back before my hosts start to wonder who's been eating their porridge. No, please! Please! I guess I can give you one more chance. All depends how far you're willing to go. And what you're willing to do. Anything! Are you sure? Well, okay then. Let's see what we have. My God. No. What are you... What are you gonna do? Me? Nothing. It's for you. What? The... That's not gonna cut through the door. No, I don't expect it will. No. No, no, I can't. I can't do that. Then you'll die here. Why are you like this? What happened to you? What happened to you? You must have been a person once. You had a family. A mother. You had a sister. What would she think? Finding out who her little baby brother is? Maybe... Maybe you've already shown her. Is that it? Is that what happened? You found the photograph, I take it. That does look a little like me, doesn't it? It's amazing what you can pick up at a garage sale. You're here for a reason, Mallory. It's no more coincidence than you and I meeting on the road. And there's only one way you're gonna get out of this. You have to accept responsibility. Take things into your own hands. Now, I'd love to stay and chat, but I've gotta get going. But I will be back to say goodnight. Assuming you're still here. Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Fuck. No. Fuck. Shit. God, thank you. We interrupt this program with a severe weather warning. Drivers are advised to take alternate routes where possible due to severe flooding. Emergency procedures are in place. Stay tuned for further information. Now returning to our program. Help! Help, I'm down here! Help! Help! Help! Hey, Mallory. It's me. Did you actually try it? Mallory. I didn't think you had it in you. Jesus, fuck! What are you smiling at? Car keys. Really? That's your plan? Actually, I was planning on cutting your throat first, but I guess a girl can't have everything. Ain't gonna do you any good. Fuck you! I suppose you think you're pretty clever. There's nobody up there. The road's abandoned! Is it? That's not what I heard! You're gonna regret that, I promise you. Then what the fuck are you waiting for? God damn it! God! Help! Help! Standby, all units. Jesus. Be prepared to copy for a missing persons report. Afternoon, Officer. Howdy. Car trouble? You need me to call for a tow? You know, I think I got it. Are you sure? Believe me, you don't wanna be stuck out here if this weather gets worse. You bet. You wanna give it a try? Just in case? I'll do that. Something the matter? Would you believe I locked my keys inside? It really ain't your day, is it? Hey, you think you can give me a ride? There's a spare set in the cabin downriver. The Goldman place? Yeah, you know Bill and Sue? Sure. Sure. Yeah, hop in. I'll take you. All right, just give me one sec. All right. Did you... Did you hear that? Subject is Mallory Rutledge. White female, 5'4", 110 pounds, blonde, blue eyes. It was this way, I think. Subject was last seen traveling from San Francisco to Denver in blue 1995 Ford Bronco. Possibly being held against her will. Any unit coming into contact, please hold and notify authority of an on-duty supervisor. You sure you're not hearing things? No. Shit. Help! Hey, it's really starting to come down. Help! Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Help! Help! Please! Please, I'm down here! Whoa! Jesus! Nice catch. Reflex. Come on. This damn weather. Driving me crazy. White female, 5'4", 110 pounds. Blonde, blue eyes. Subject was last seen traveling from San Francisco to Denver. Come back! Please, come back! Please! No! God! My God. No! Shit! Shit! No! God! Shit! Shit! God, no! Okay. Shit! Shit! No! God! No! No! Fuck. Shit! God! Fuck. Shit. Get off! Help! Get off me! Please! Shit! Fuck. Help! You see, my pa was a preacher. Any time I'd dare misbehave, which wasn't that often, he'd take me out to the barn and strap me up just like this. He'd leave me there. All day, all night. You stopped to help me. I didn't ask you to. Like I didn't ask the family to invite me in. You got me into this. You made the choice to stop. You people go about your life making these choices that you think have no consequences. I'm here to show you that they do. Well, Officer? Anything to say? Fuck you. That's more like it. Can I help you, ma'am? Having a little trouble with your car, ma'am? License and registration, please. License and registration, please. Quiet, Katie. I told you to be quiet down there. Good evening, ma'am. License and registration, please. Be down in just a minute. Shh! It's okay, okay? He's upstairs. Please, help me. It's okay, it's okay. Hurry. Everything okay in here? Now, we've talked about noise, haven't we? I thought we had an understanding, but if we need to discuss it some more, I'm sure I can find a needle and thread. Don't you fucking touch her! You move, you breathe, you're dead. Get off! Katie, run! Run! Mallory? Mallory? Mallory? You really are full of surprises. Been a long time since I've had so much fun. Really, I ought to thank you for that. I am curious, though, how you managed to get out. I thought you were gonna die in there. One way or another. Perhaps this was how it was meant to be. Boo! No! Get the fuck away from me! Can't run from fate, Mallory. Shit! No! No matter how hard you try. Almost! Get the fuck away from me! This was how I hoped it would end. I always knew it would happen this way. Does this feel like your destiny now? Argh! Mallory. I know you're out there. Fuck! Fuck! It's okay. That looks painful. You need some help? Now, now, I don't think you realize how much trouble you're in. That's an awful lot of blood. I'm guessing you missed your femoral artery, because, frankly, you'd be dead by now if you hadn't. Fuck you. But God knows what other damage you've done. Doesn't look good. Now, I'd love to stay and chat, but I gotta get going. I wouldn't want you to think that I was being unfair. So I'm gonna give you the same chance that you gave me. I've been thinking a lot about what you said. About fate. Maybe you were right. Maybe it was supposed to be like this. Maybe you just got in the wrong fucking car! It's okay. It's over. It's over. You're gonna be okay.
