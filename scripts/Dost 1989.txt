Now look, at this animal. It's an animal. It has Iife. If we export this animal that would be called smuggling, a sin. But what do I do? I'm helpless. My business is smuggling. Hey Villu! Yes, sir. Put these animals inside. Okay, sir. So, Lalvani sir, did you bring my money? Yes, I've got it. Count it if you want. There is no need to count, Lalvani sir. In our business, we betray law, but never each other. This is the first rule of the illegal business. Mr. Sher Singh. Yes. While coming here I'd heard that the security in this jungle's check post is very tight. Look, in our country, tight security exists everywhere. But bribery is a very powerful thing. The heat of bribery melts the strict laws like butter. You don't worry. My son Nagender has made a very good arrangement. You'll pass the check post like how a hot knife passes an ice wall. What is in this truck? I'd told Sher Singh to give you some money. Here it is? This is nothing. Even if he had filled a truck with money still this Anthony would not have accepted it. I'd played a ruse, to catch you red handed. No, no, sir. How much money you want, you'll get. But leave us. Shut up! I arrest you with the smuggling goods. My dear, Anthony. We got suspicious when you accepted the bribe so easily. Because we knew that you're an honest officer. So I was keeping a watch on you. And I on you. Since a long time I'd been keeping a tab on your smuggling activities, Mr. Nagender. I'll drag you in the court, see to it that you're punished and thus put an end on the illegal activities in this region. Law, justice, court and honesty these words apply only in cities. Not in jungles, officer. Here the law of animals is applicable. If one animal has to survive it is necessary to kill another animal. It's essential to drink another's blood to quench one's thirst. So, I'll have to become a lion and kill you as my hunt. Good morning, good morning, Bansi. Give it to me. Thank you. Forest officer Raja. What! Anthony! Raja, are you scared to do this job after the death of Anthony? Not at all, sir. In fact I've started appreciating my duty and my position more than before. If I don't arrest and punish the criminals who murdered Anthony then people will stop trusting the police force and justice, sir. That's correct, Raja. That's why the department has decided to transfer you to Anthony's place. Any objection? No, sir. This country gave a scholarship to an orphan like me and made me such a big officer. I have many debts to pay for the favours of this motherland. And it's my duty to arrest people who rob her, sir. Very good, Raja. I want you to join your duty from tomorrow. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Bansi. Thank you very much. I've applied herbs on your wound. You'll be fine. I'm your friend, Raja. Thank you. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Sir, I think you're the new officer Raja sir. Am I right? Yes, but who are you? I'm your chef, servant, driver, cleaner dry cleaner everything mashed into one. My name is Sukha. Sukha? What a name! You see sir, when I was in the city my name used to be Sukhiya. But I became Sukha from Sukhiya from the time I resumed my duty in the jungle. Even dangerous animals don't eat me when they pass my way. My life is all dry. No problem. I'll make your life lively. Till that time you get my luggage from the Jeep. And carry Bansi and Mithu carefully. If you talk rubbish, then both of them will rip you apart. Go. Bansi and Mithu? Who are these? Friends, check post and thorny trees are not sufficient to end the smuggling in this jungle. We desperately need the weapons of honesty, duty and courage. To nab our enemies, we'll have to work 24 hours and not just our usual duty hours. And we'll do this work not only for our salary but also for the honour of our position. Understand? Yes, sir. Sir, I was having my meals to fill my stomach. I got the information that you've called me. So I left my plate, and here I'm present in front of you with my half stomach. So tell me what's the matter, stomach? I mean, sir? Can you help me? Sir, I tell you from my stomach's heart that I can give you what you want. Can you give me a loan of 1 0,000 rupees? Sir, don't say this again. Otherwise my stomach will burst. Sir, to tell you the truth, I don't even know how many zeros are there in 1 0,000. I don't know. Okay, tell me, in this department who is the person who can give me a loan. In our department? There is one person. Who? Sukhiram. Will he have so much cash? Sir, there's not a thing that he doesn't have. Sir, now you'll ask me how he got all this. I'll give you the same old answer. With the grace of stomach. Sir, sometimes this stomach makes a person a devil. Sir, but don't tell this to Sukhiram. He'll kick me in my stomach. Can I go now, sir? Okay. Sir, sir, you? Can I come inside? Welcome, sir. Welcome. Wow! What a nice house! Sir, its government quarters. This imported liquor, this fridge T.V, V.C.R. and this red carpet. Even this is given by the government. Am I right? Sir, actually Yes, I know. Now you'll try to say that all this is family heritage. But I know very well, Sukhiram that your father was a watchman and your mother had to clean other's dishes to make you an officer. Now don't try to lie. And tell me truthfully, what is your salary? Sir, 1200 rupees. A person who earns 1200 rupees as salary can't drink scotch. A person who earns 1200 rupees as salary can't have a colour T.V. No, sir, what are you doing? Bastard, being a policeman you cheat law. Before becoming a policeman we have to take an oath. Did you forget that oath too? Get up. Anthony lost his life because of people like you. Sir, please forgive me. Look, look, this blood. Let it flow. Let the impure blood of bribery come out of your body. Now give me the names of those who bribed you. What's the address of the people who killed Anthony? Sir, God promise, I don't know their name and address. Those people just throw money while passing through the check post. And I get busy collecting that money. I never tried to Iook at their face. Because I believe that the less I know about them the more will I live. Gangu. Yes, sir. Keep my car ready. I have to go in the jungle. What! Again jungle! Let my fate burn! Sita, marrying Ram, had to live in the jungles only for 14 years. And look at me. I'm living in this jungle for You care neither for me nor for this house. The whole day, you're either in that timber shop or roaming in the jungle. Along with you, you've even made my son Nagender an animal. I wish my nephew, Budhi was here. I could have at least poured out my soul to him. I don't know when my dear Budhi will come. Here I come, aunty. I've come, uncle. Budhi, you've come, my dear has come. You'd gone to Kashi university, hadn't you? Did you get your PUC certificate or you just ate and became fat like a buffalo. Fat? I'm fat? Shall I show you the mirror? Shut up! If this time you fail, then my heart will also fail. If this is the matter, uncle, call a doctor immediately. Why? Because this time too there are good chances that I'll fail. Will you again fail? Aunty, I've got Banarasi sari for you from Kashi. God bless you, my son. You always get a sari for me whenever you go to give your exam. I bless you, God willing, may you fail for another 12 years and you keep bringing sari for me. Uncle. What is this? This is a container. I've got it for you. It contains the sacred water of Ganga. When you are on the verge of dying I'll sprinkle this holy water on you with Basil leaves. Keep it safely. It's a useful thing. Budhi! When did you come? When did you come! Talk with respect. I'm elder to you. Take this. I've got sacred thread for you from Kashi. Wear it on your neck. Your sins will become less. Do one thing, put it on your neck, and hang yourself. Uncle, Nagender's bad luck is unlucky. You only keep these two things carefully. It will help you in your bad times. You fool! Do you know how much money I had to spend for your PUC certificate? How much? When he'll marry my brotherinlaw's friend's son his wife will bring crores of rupees as dowry. Because she is the only daughter. And they're going to give all their wealth to their soninlaw. Stop your nonsense! Look at this shit fool and that fairy like girl. No, no, no. If she marries, then she'll marry my son Nagender. No, uncle. This is injustice. I agree that my brain's battery is a bit low. A bit! Yes, I mean the current of understanding comes a bit late. This doesn't mean that you'll cancel my marriage. No, I'm the eldest in this house. I'll marry first. My newly wed, where is your palace? Princess, have mercy on me. If you miss your target, then this bullet will hit my head. Shut up! Ready one two three You! Princess, egg. Shall I make omelette. You shut up! Daughter, what is this. This gun, this shooting. This foolish Bhola made me miss my target. Next time, either this hen will live or this Bhola. Dear, it's the age of your marriage. And you play with guns and knives. What to do daddy? I get bored. Shall I tell you what to do to pass your time? What? Do you remember Ramgard's jungle? Yes, you used to say that one of your friends stays there. Yes, now he is no more. But his son lives there. And my friend's brother, Sher Singh, too lives there. Even he has a son. And both are of marriageable age. You can marry with one of them. I'll call them here. No, daddy, you don't call them. I'll myself go in that jungle. I'll get to see them and also get the chance to hunt. Yes, Brijmohanji. Yes. What? You're sending Pooja here? When is she coming? Yes, you don't worry. I'll send the jeep. No, no, no problem. After all, your daughter is my tobe daughterinlaw. I'll look after her as my own child. Okay, bye. My girl is coming! I'll go with the jeep right away! I go Shut up! You don't listen properly and you jump like a bear. She's coming tomorrow. You called him bear for such a small thing. Calling him a bear is like respecting him. He's worst than a cave man. Aunty, am I worst than a cave man? No, dear. Don't take your uncle's talks to heart. You try to entice your Pooja. With my beautiful face, I'll hit. With my beautiful face, I'll hit. Where has this stupid driver gone? Idiot. Okay, I will myself drive this jeep. That rascal will come running after me. Today the weather is good, Bansi. Bansi, someone is running away with our jeep. Nab him. Good morning. Monkey. Yes, monkey. And this jeep, which you're driving. Both these things belong to me. Did you like it? Shut up! Where had you gone leaving the jeep in the station? And on top of that you came here bringing this monkey with you. Idiot! Enough, enough, enough. Mind your tongue, madam. My Bansi is short tempered. He'll beat you with the whip of his tail. How dare you talk like that! I'll complain about this to my uncle. I'll change my name if I don't cut you and this monkey's tail. First, put this monkey down and drive this jeep. Before driving the jeep you'll have to apologize to both of us. What! I and apologize to both of you! What nonsense! Do you know who I am! Very well. You're a relative of Bansi. You! You! First you apologize then only will I take you. What do you think? That I can't go without this old jeep? I can walk. Madam, madam, you can definitely go. But let me tell you one thing. The big and dangerous animals in this jungle have got bored eating the flesh of the small animals. They'll enjoy eating the flesh of a beautiful girl like you. And you've just stepped into youth. God bless you. I'm not scared of anyone. This is a jungle. And you're alone. You don't have any friends with you. This is a jungle. And you're alone. You don't have any friends with you. Your eyes are like deer, the lion will eat you. Where are you going? Bears don't spare any girls. Bears are really very cunning. Lion will drink your sweet blood. And live longer. You'll scream with fright and the cheetah will take you away. This is a jungle. And you're alone. You don't have any friends with you. The eagle will bite you on your cheeks. You'll dance with pain. The snake will grab your thin waist. But the thorn will taste this body. This is a jungle. And you're alone. You don't have any friends with you. When the elephant runs with joy. It will mash you up like a delicate flower. Apologize and say you're sorry. I'll save you from all the dangers. This is a jungle. And you're alone. You don't have any friends with you. Your eyes are like deer, the lion will eat you. Hang on, have you seen Poojaji? You're Sher Singh uncle's Nephew, BRMCD. Budhi Ram Makar Chand Dimagwala. PUC 12 times appeared, never passed. So you're Budhi. I'm Pooja. Where did she go? Forgive me. I couldn't control my emotions. It's alright, Budhiji. Budhiji, who kept this driver? God might have kept him, we didn't. This is not our driver. Then our jeep? Our jeep is this. While coming to the station some dust got into its carbonator. I see. Now I understand. Why this person was acting so smugly. Was he? Yes. Budhiji, if you truly love me then thrash this driver for troubling me. I'll just do it. What's the need of beating him? It's this poor person's first mistake. So we'll forgive him. Excuse given. No, at least slap him once. One slap. No, it will be the insult of my hand to beat an ordinary driver. I'll do one thing. I'll beat his master. Then who will beat him? Our driver. Don't hit me. Send your master to my place, I'll give him a tight slap. Then my driver will give you a tight slap. You bear it. Because every person should be beaten according to his class. Am I right? No, you're wrong. I don't differentiate between master and driver. I consider everyone equally. How? Shall I give an example? Yes. Aunty! Look my tobe daughterinlaw has come. Dear, it seems like wealth has entered our house by your coming here. Nagender has gone out. He'll just be back. What are you doing? You've burdened our daughterinlaw with such heavy luggage. Carry this yourself. Come, dear, dear. Gangu. Yes, sir. Look, from today in this house honey, cream, almond, the meat of delicate birds No, no, uncle! I won't be able to eat so much. I'll become fat. Reduce it a bit. It's not for you. This is for Pooja dear. Hello. Who's this? Really. Okay. I'll come. I'll just come. I'm watching this new officer from the time he has come in this region. He's continuously causing trouble for us. He has put up check post on all the roads going out of this jungle. He's creating hurdles in our smooth running business. What's the need to be so anxious? That poor fellow is doing his duty. If making check post is his duty then it's my duty to teach him a lesson. You just give me the permission, dad, I'll kill him. If you continue killing people like this then government will one day kill us. But sir, how will our goods go out of the jungle today? You don't worry. The goods will be delivered. Hello. Officer sir. After some time, a truck filled with smuggling goods is going to pass from Ramgard road. Who are you? I'm a poor nomad who lives in the jungle. Hello hello hello Hello, this is Raja speaking. Send the entire unit to Ramgard road. Immediately. Open! Open it! So you gave the wrong information to the guards and send them in the opposite direction. So that you can smuggle the goods easily. Come on, move! Move! You? Yes, sir. This elephant saved you. What are you saying, Sukha? It's true. He had brought you here when you were unconscious. With God's blessing and grace, you survived, sir. No, Sukha. Neither with God's blessing nor with His grace. He only saved me. For me he is God. You repaid your favour very soon, friend. In this world where humans are thirsty for human's blood. You saved my life though you're an animal. Thank you so much. Sir, so many times I've kept fruits before them. But they didn't touch it. They were worried about your health. Give them this fruit with your own hand. From now onwards you'll stay here only. As a family member. Is it okay with you? From today your name is Ram. Fine with you? He gave his assent. Greetings. My greetings to the officer sir who protects the mother jungle. I received your command. And Mongola came to you bringing everyone. You came here on officer's command. Or you tried to kill officer on his coming here? Don't say these things, guard! Such dirty thoughts can never enter my mind! Really! Who were those nomads with feathers in their head and spears in their hands who attacked officer sir with arrows? Weren't they your tribesmen? No! Not at all! Officer sir, tomorrow I'll bring all my tribesmen. You just point out that person. God promise, I'll cut that person's head and sacrifice it on Goddess's feet. Mongola, I very well know that your tribesmen didn't attack me. But some people were trying to deceive me using the guise of your tribesmen. Inform your people, if they see any illegal activities in the jungle or if they are suspicious of someone then they should inform me immediately. Understood? Yes, officer sir. Go. Greetings, greetings officer sir, greetings. Sir, I my name is Sher Singh. Cutting the trees in the jungle is my family occupation. I have the control over the jungle. This is my son Nagender. He helps me in my work. Greet him, sit down, son. By the way, sir, we immediately come to greet a new officer. But we were late in meeting you. You see, we were busy with our work. No problem. You've come, that's sufficient for me. What are you saying? This is my duty. And when I got the news that some dangerous tribesmen have attacked you, I could wait no more. I had to come. Who told you that some dangerous tribesmen had attacked me? Nagender told me about this. What? No, I didn't say it. If not Nagender then yes, a rumour we heard a rumour I see, I see, the person who spread this rumour tell them that those foolish people can't scare me with their wealth, power and their tussles. I'll spoil their faces in such a way that even the mirror won't recognise their reflection. And also tell them that the drama going on in this jungle in the guise of trees and leaves very soon I'm going to unmask that drama. Wow! Great, sir. Seeing your courage my heart is beating faster with delight. But, sir, many officers before you too had sent such news. But unfortunately, the next day they received the news of death. I'm talking about your good only. Look, living in the jungle, you should never take up a fight with the lion. Thank you. Thank you very much. You did a favour to me by telling me about those people. Now it would be more favourable if you know a bit about me too. Because you might need to tell them something about me. Am I right? Sukha. Yes, sir. Bring that thing. I'll just get it, sir. What? Coffee? Cold drink? No, we won't have anything to drink. Don't take the trouble. I don't mind. You're forcefully making us drink tea. Mr. Sher Singh, do you know what this is? I know that these are handcuffs. No, no. This is duty. This is justice. And this is law. People who don't respect these three things to tie their hands is it's mission. And I've come in this jungle to punish the guilty. Do you think we're cowards? To wear this? No, no, you're mistaken. I'm talking about those people about whom you were telling me. Those people those people who spread rumours. Understood? I understood. But when the time comes, even you'll understand what is a jungle and how to live in it. Thank you. Wow! What a beauty! You seem to be a fallen angel! You're glimmering after falling from above. What a great job God has done to make you taking His own time. What's your name? Your name? Geli. You're Geli, I'm Sukha. I'm craving for love for thousands of years. Are you abusing me! No, no, no, no. I'm catching your beauty, putting it on paper and showing it to you, I want to win your heart. You'll put me on paper? How? Like how you're standing. Don't move, don't move. I caught you, I grabbed you, I got a car. Look at this my birdie, you're captured in this. O my God! This is me! This is an amazing thing! This is nothing, Geli. Nothing in this world is of value before my charisma. But the amazing thing is that nothing is amazing in me. You're not an ordinary person. You're either a magician or a saint. If you listen to me, then I'll show you a greater miracle. Come closer, in my arms. We're made for each other. Play with marbles. Tearing notes, reduce it into penny. Budhiji! Yes. Do you have any grey cells? Yes, I do. It's been one week since I came here. And no one took me for hunting. I'd planned to hunt every day. Poojaji, hunting is a useless thing. Let's play marble. Dear, this foolish person eats the animals hunted by others. He never hunts. Coward! Belonging to this place. Sit! Dear. Yes. Hunting is for people like us. Look, this skin of lion, I'd killed it at night. And this heavy antelopes my son had killed it early in the morning. They're lying. I had purchased it for 1 00 rupees. Don't believe him. My son will take you for hunting. Wonderful! While hunting in this deep jungle remember one thing, never make a sound. Pooja. Yes. A cunning hunter follows an animal by the footmarks it leaves on the ground. Or by smelling it in the air, find out its hiding place. Really! Yes. Look, over there. Wow! Deer! I'll hunt. A deer is a fast animal. You have to be very careful while hunting it. Come with me, come. Lie down, lie down. Here? Yes. Take this gun in your hand. Now, do you see? Now shoot. How had that innocent animal wronged you? That you wanted to kill it. You're lucky. You've worn the uniform of an officer. If you had come as an ordinary person then I would have killed you. Really! Now I'm not Forest Officer Raja. But an ordinary person. I'm not a betrayer like you. As an officer, I can arrest you now. And as an ordinary person, I can kill you now. But no, I'm sparing you. I'd heard that a woman's heart is a temple of mercy and love. Look at every living thing be it human or animal with love and sympathy. Woman is a form of God on this earth. Woman doesn't take life but gives life. Remember this. Move! I'm taking a bit of sweet. Come dear, have dinner. Aunty, look, how he's staring like a hungry vulture. Don't give him everything. Otherwise, I'll have to go hungry. Shut up! A glutton! You always talk about food only. Bharati, give this special dish to Pooja dear. Pooja dear, this is fry rabbit. 'I'd heard that a woman's heart is a temple of mercy and love.' 'Look at every living thing be it human or animal with love and sympathy.' 'Woman is a form of God on this earth.' 'Woman doesn't take life but gives life. Remember this.' Dear, why did you get up without eating? I'm not hungry. But I'm hungry. I'll eat your share too. Eat it, you elephant. First eat the meat, then eat the plate too. Yes, first I'll eat rabbit fry, and then plate fry. I am a disco dancer. I am a disco dancer. He is cooking food. This means, he's unmarried. I'm crazy for this Sukha, where had you gone? Princess, you and here. What's the matter? Have you come to take the permission of hunting? Or leaving animal, you've come to fry and eat human's meat? O no. I've come to say sorry. What? Apologize and you? From where did the sun rise today? You talk so sweetly. This is my childhood habit. You're cooking meals? O yes, you're unmarried. Neither am I unmarried, nor am I a cheapo. By the way, who told you that I'm unmarried? That means you're married. Yes. And my wife has gone to her parents' house. Why? Did you leave her? What do you mean by I left her? Does every man always hold on to his pregnant wife? Pregnant! So you are going to have a child also now. What did you think I am? Fine, tell me one thing. If I will have twin children's then what should I name them as? What are you asking me for? Keep any name. Tall or short or whatever! Hey madam! Hey madam! This is a human being's child. It is not an animal's child that I will call them anything as you say. It is good that my wife is not at home otherwise she would have properly whacked you. Yes! If she would have whacked me then would I remain silent? Even I would have whacked her! Wow! Is this your wife? Yes, she is. She looks absolutely similar to a monkey. Hey! First you called my children with various other names. And now you are insulting my wife. I will slap you in such a manner now that your beautiful face will turn into an ugly one. Will you slap me? If I will not call this untamed woman a monkey then should I call her an angel? Yes. But an untamed woman only suits a man like you. Hey madam! My wife is not a monkey neither she is uneducated. She is literate. Actually, she sometimes changes her appearances to entertain me. She changes her appearances! Yes. That means she is into acting! Yes, this is our business. I act in during the day and she acts during the night. O my God! This family is so shameless! Look madam, let it be anything. Let the pillow be soft or let the utensil be hot. Whatever I am, I am here in front of you. Thank you for spitting! Hey! Why did he need to get married so soon? I have liked somebody for the first time in my life and even he is already married. Thank you! Beautiful! Hey! What is this? Where are you taking me? Hey! Where are you taking me? Hey! Please let go of me. Eat it! As you have taken away my heart eat this carrot also. Hey! You have broken it so beautifully! You have broken it so beautifully! Hey! When you smile, my dear Hey! What is all this? She is Gilli! She has met me right now. But she is officer Raja's wife, isn't it? She is so silly and ordinary. Will Mr. Raja fall for her? No! No! I am sufficient for her. Do you know her very well? I know her, madam. I am hers officer and she is mine. Mr. Raja has not even married until now. What! He has not yet been married until now! What is your name? Sukha! And she is Gilli! Gilli! Sukha and Gilli! How does our pair look? Good, isn't it? Very good! If you will listen to me then I will get you both married. Otherwise I will tell the people in the community about you and they will kill you. Hey! Madam! Don't do that. If my Sukha will die then my life will be completely barren. Madam, please tell me that what do I have to do? What is this? What do you want a holiday for? Sir, for my stomach! For your stomach! Hey! The entire world works in order to earn their living. And instead you are asking for a holiday. No! Not for my stomach, sir. But for my wife's stomach. Sir, it is very necessary for me to be with her. Isn't it, sir? Even six months ago, you had taken holidays with this excuse only. Even that holiday was for the stomach only, sir. I mean that for my wife's delivery. You understand, sir! I understand. I do understand. If you need to take holidays again and again for your wife's delivery then why do you need to work? For my stomach, sir! I mean I mean for this stomach, sir! Fine. So this is the matter! Hey! My lover! My husband! O my dear! Hey! Let go of me. Why have you come here? Sir, let her come here for anybody Shut up! Don't speak rubbish! Out! Out! My lover! My husband! Hey! I am your wife! Hey! Did you become my wife in the very first meeting? In my second meeting, you will tell me that I am the mother of your child. Yes, I already am. Hey! What do you mean by you are? Hey! Look, don't wrack my brains! I am a bachelor. I don't have any wife. So is she not your wife? No, she isn't My lover! My husband! Hey! Look! Hey! No! How can you refuse to accept her as your wife? For the sake of your happiness and pleasure she has disguised herself as an untamed girl. My lover! Look. Look, I had lied to you that I am already married. My lover! Hey! Get away! Look, please do one work. Quickly take her away from here. Please! That's good! Gilli, you can leave now. Really! Fine. So you are not married yet. No! This means that the post of a wife is vacant. Yes! So from today onwards I am your wife! We both have become one somehow, my beloved! We have united like the body in our soul. In the first step, we shook our hands. In the second step, we winked at each other. In the third step, our hearts met. And in the fourth step, we fell in love. Step by step! Step by step! We both have become one somehow, my beloved! We have united like the body in our soul. In the first step, we shook our hands. In the second step, we winked at each other. In the third step, our hearts met.

The place for their beloved was vacant in both their hearts. Even you were eager for love, my beloved! Even I was eager. In the first step, you thought about it. In the second step, you thought about it. In the third step, we made commitments. In the fourth step, we fell in love. Step by step! Step by step! I can see the difference that I have made in your life,. The dreams which I had seen I am able to picture them in you. I can see the difference that I have made in your life,.

In the fourth step, we fell in love. Step by step! Step by step! We both have become one somehow, my beloved! We have united like the body in our soul. You shut up! If she wants to get married then she will get married to my sweet, cute little Budhi. No! If she will get married then he will get married to the boy named Naginder who is tall and healthy. To Budhi! To Naginder! To Budhi! To Naginder! To Budhi! To Naginder! Hey! Why are you both yelling like mad people? Pooja will get married neither to Naginder nor to me. But instead, she will be married to somebody else. What are you saying? I am not speaking anything rubbish. Instead I am telling something very useful. A respectable talk! I have seen her myself. With my own eyes! She was singing love songs in the arms of that forest officer. She was dancing along with him. Budhi, are you joking or are you saying the truth? I am saying the truth. I swear on your youth! If Pooja will do so then we will lose the property worth crores of rupees forever. But aunt, why are you saying Govinda! Govinda! Do you intend to go to Tirupati and shave off uncle's hair? No. We have to chop off the head of a devil like you. Hey! Why are you getting angry with him? Go and scream at that person whose fault it is. Look, she is coming. Pooja! Yes. Where had you gone? Just like that. I had gone to roam around in the jungle. Or had you gone to dance around with somebody? Uncle! You are getting attracted to the outsiders instead of your near ones. Are you out of your senses? Why are you getting angry with me? I do things according to my wish. I will meet anyone I want to meet. And I love Raja! What did you say? You love that ordinary man who earns just 1 000 rupees as salary? He is our biggest enemy. Look, he might be nobody to you but he is my wouldbe husband. Shut up! Your father sent you over here so that you could get along well with my son Naginder. An not with some forest officer who digs around everyday in the forest. Listen to me carefully, young girl! If you get married then you will get married to my son Naginder. You will not get married to anybody else. Why? Why should I get married to your son? What qualities does your son have? He seems to be so wild because of his activities as if he is not human but a wild animal. You scoundrel! How dare you hit me! I inform my dad about it right now We will inform your father. We are tolerating it. That is why you are crossing all your limits now. Leave me! I said leave me! Shut up! Open the door! Daddy, call up uncle and ask him to come here immediately. Uncle, this is a crime. This is injustice. If she loves somebody else then who are you to stop her? We cannot stop her! Shut up! I will call up Digvijay right now. He hit me! And I will make her my daughterinlaw tomorrow. I will call up the police right now and get your fat husband arrested. Fine. Fine. Go, my son! Go! Hey! No! Don't go! Mr. Budhi, please take me out from here. I too will be dead along with you. Bring your ears close to my mouth. Your ears! My mouth! What is the matter? You are here so late in the night. I have run away from their house who trap human beings in cages like animals. What happened? Uncle Sher Singh came to know that we both love each other. He simply got angry and he started insisting that I should get married to his son. When I refused that rascal Naginder slapped me. Raja, I will never go back to that house again. All right! All right! We will discuss about this matter to your father. Greetings, officer! Greetings! This time we had a very good crop in our area. Take this. Mangala, how will I repay this favour of your love? All thanks to you, officer! He is my daddy! Uncle, he is that officer Raja. Mister, in spite of being a responsible government officer, you have done a very big crime. You have kept a young woman in your house. I can file a complaint in the police and get you arrested. Daddy, do not blame him. He did not bring me to his house. Instead I came to his house for help. This means that you want to get married to him. But we have found out about his past history. He has a very pathetic history. There is nothing to tell about the whereabouts of both his mother and father. He has been brought up in an orphanage. He has been educated by asking alms from others. Yes daughter. On what grounds is he eligible to become your life partner? To get you happiness, he has neither money nor status. Mr. Brij Mohan, in order to live a happy and peaceful life a girl needs neither money nor status. Love and affection is required. Without these two things, your richness is useless. It is futile. Uncle, he has managed to pacify Pooja by speaking about such good things. Hey! Speak respectfully! Pooja likes me and even I love Pooja! Pooja wants to get married to me. And I completely agree with her. Then how did I pacify her? Pooja doesn't have that much sense to correctly recognise the world and the wicked people of this world. You both may undoubtedly like each other. But I will never allow you both to get married. If both the people are major enough and if they want to get married then they do not need the permission of their parents. You don't teach the law to me! Will you be able to provide the basic necessities to my daughter? Who has always walked on carpets in her father's house always travelled in air conditioned cars Iived in lavish bungalows. What do you have? You are not even in a condition to have a grand wedding. A marriage does not need show off. When two people accept each other from heart, when a boy ties a yellow thread around the girl's neck with complete faith that is enough for a marriage. Considering my love to be the holy fire and my heart beats as the holy chants, I am tying this Mangalsutra around Pooja's neck. From today, Pooja is Mrs. Raja. And no one in the world will dare to reject this relation. Daddy, today, before your eyes, I got married. Bless me for a happy future. I can give blessings to my daughter, not Mrs. Raja. Come on Sher Singhji. Come on. Daughter, you shouldn't cry after getting married. The Goddess is hurt. What if that father does not give his daughter blessings this father will surely do it. You're my diamond and pearl. You're the light of my eyes. If you are by my side Iove will always shower on us in this way. You're my diamond and pearl. You're my diamond and pearl. You're the light of my eyes. If you are by my side Iove will always shower on us in this way. You're my diamond and pearl. This world doesn't matter when you are before me. This world doesn't matter when you are before me. Be with me all the way always walk besides me in storms. You're my diamond and pearl. You're the light of my eyes. If you are by my side Iove will always shower on us in this way. You're my diamond and pearl. You're my diamond and pearl. Why should I look at the buds and stars when your face is before me. Why should I look at the buds and stars when your face is before me. How can the black night harm us when your eyes are like the sun. You're my diamond and pearl. You're the light of my eyes. If you are by my side Iove will always shower on us in this way. You're my diamond and pearl. You're my diamond and pearl. You're the light of my eyes. If you are by my side Iove will always shower on us in this way. You're my diamond and pearl. You're my diamond and pearl. You are responsible for all this chaos, Dad. You always stopped me from attacking that rascal. You kept on telling me to wait and watch like a tiger and attack like a vulture when you get the opportunity. But now, he has attacked us on the right spot. He ruined our business and married Pooja. What if he has married her? Today is their wedding night! Next thing she'll be pregnant. And then there will be a child. And then we father and son will cuddle their child in our laps. Naginder, your father's mind is like a sea of bad ideas. Where every moment, waves of bad ideas keep on coming. You always wanted to finish that officer and I always stopped you thinking that he'll fulfill his duty but staying in his limits. But he crossed those Iimits. And now I'll cross his life out. Today is an auspicious day and auspicious time too. Auspicious time! Yes. The priest has told me that we should get united at exactly 12 at night. Why is that? Darling, that's because a 12 pm union will cause 12 kids. Who are just like me! Why do you feel shy? Hurry up. I don't want to miss that time. But it's still 5 minutes before it is 12. Ok then. To spend those 5 minutes I'll give you 5 sweet kisses. Hey! You're laughing? No. I didn't laugh. Then may be I was laughing internally. Never mind. What is this! You are making fun of me by laughing. I'll bite you. But I didn't laugh. If you didn't laugh, then did I?! I think I've gone mad. Doesn't matter. Oh! So it's you all! Don't you have any shame? Today is our wedding night and you are disturbing us? Don't you have any humanity Oh, but you're animals. Go away. Go away from here. Go away. The auspicious time is passing away. Why don't you go! Sit here quietly. If you make any more noises, I'll bash you. Listen, the auspicious time is passing. Come fast. Let's hurry up. Pooja, you get ready in 1 0 minutes. I've given a holiday to Sukha. Oh! You don't even know to make breakfast. And I'm so hungry. Did you see, one minute has passed talking. You get ready in 9 minutes. I will be ready in 8 minutes. Listen, can I come in? Why? You keep bathing, I'll scrub your back. You'll be ready fast. Go away. Listen Get ready fast or else it'll be late. Go away please. Hello. Call Shankar. Shankar, you go towards Ramgarh check post. Keep an eye on both sides. Send someone to the station. Let go. Let go. Let go. Rascal! Help! No No Raja No! No! Help! No Ramu! Get back! Back up Ramu! Come on. Yes. Sher Singh speaking. Son Naginder. Tell me. What happened? Did you place those bride and groom in Satan's lap and sent them up. What happened? Why are you crying? You see, a mosquito bit me on the neck. I killed it. You ass, stop killing mosquitoes and fleas. Tell me if you killed them. Yes, yes. Yes Daddy. I cut them into pieces. Very good! You'll surely make me famous. Yes. I will. Daddy, there is some good news for you. A party has come who wants to buy our goods at a good price. Really? From where has it come? Yes Daddy. It has come from Calcutta. They want the goods urgently. You keep the goods ready. I'll get the party. Alright. Come fast. Yes daddy. I'll be right there. Come on, work fast. A new party is coming. Once they like our goods, they'll be our permanent customers. Son Naginder, see everything is ready for you. Aren't they here yet? They are here. Sher Singh, this is duty, justice and law. I gave you this lesson when I came here. But you forgot it. Inspector, take him. Hurry up. Criminal Sher Singh and his son Naginder are given a sentence of 6 years imprisonment under the Forest Protection Act for the crime of smuggling government property from the jungle. Mr. Raja, from today there will be just one goal in my life. After getting released, I'll kill you. The feelings of anger and revenge in your mind may compel you to finish me. But the force of revenge can never bend duty and truth. Whenever you try, you will lose. Let us come out first, then we'll decide who wins and who loses. No. Not that one. The one on the other side. Yes. Throw a big one, this is so small. Ok. Forget it. Go on that branch. Up there. Yes. Go there. Shake it hard. Did you have your food?! Hey Bansi! What is this drama? You want a holiday once again. Sir, this time the holiday is very necessary due to my stomach. Last time, I gave you an off for your stomach itself. That holiday was for the stomach in those days. This one is for the stomach today. Sir, my wife is pregnant again. I think you have opened a factory of stomachs. You fulfill the duty of stomach more than that of government. So you, who fulfils stomach duty more will have to take a holiday forever, for the country's sake. Sir please, don't suspend me. Pooja, so many mangoes! Are you making a pickle? No sir. This too is for the stomach. Hey you! Stop this nonsense. You always get your stomach in between. But sir, this time it is not for my stomach. This time I'm talking about the madam's stomach. Look, if madam is having raw mangoes with such taste she is definitely pregnant. Sir, if madam is feeling so shy it means she definitely is pregnant. Congratulations sir. Congratulations! Thank you. Mr. Batheram, on this occasion I grant you the holiday. Thank you sir. By the way, shall I call the head office and apply for one week holiday for you? Why? Because, the reason for both of our holidays is the same stomach! Shut up! When it is the case of one's own stomach he understands fast. Brother, I'll leave now. My wife is pregnant. Pooja Pooja, where are you? Pooja? Where? You're caught. Hey! Why did you hide such sweet, pretty things from me? Because husbands should themselves find out some things. Correct. Hello. Hello. Who's in there? Boy or a girl or both? Enough now. Why enough, madam? This is the beginning. These kisses used to be sweet? How come they are sour? They will always be sour from now. Why? Because now I'll save all my sweetness for my son. Hello! Daddy, it's me. Pooja. Why did you call? I have some good news for you. I'm You're going to be a grandpa. Daddy, when a girl is going to be a mother for the first time she needs her mother the most. For me you are mother and father, both. I want to see you. Come and meet me once. Sorry. I'm going abroad for business. I can't come. Daddy, daddy Pooja. Why are you saying daddy, daddy? Did he call up? Yes. It was his call. He had called up. And when I gave him the good news of him becoming a grandfather, he was very happy. And started saying, when you will be in the second or the third month, then come and meet me. And he also asked me to get you along with me. You are lying to me aren't you? Mad lady, this usually happens. To get their point across, old people usually act very stubbornly, like small kids. And the minute we get close to them they don't like it. The hatred from the heart goes, if we stay far away. But this time, I didn't ask for anything. I just asked him to come and meet me once. Pooja, even if for a moment we think that your father doesn't recognise you as his own child. So what? Am I not yours? Animals of this house love you more than your own relatives. Is this Iess? And now regarding the that we will perform. Come on smile and laugh. Ours is a small family. This is our world. Never will you feel the void. Never will you feel the void. You have our love with you. Ours is a small family. This is our world. Always keep smiling Sita. Happiness will come to you for sure. So what if seven wed brides aren't there. So what if seven wed brides aren't there. We will sing the 'godhbharai' for you. Ours is a small family. This is our world. Gajraja is your elder brother. Is near you to protect you. Understood! Gajraja is your elder brother. Is near you to protect you. What should I say for this parrot? It's like your sweet sister. He is Lord Hanuman's helper, who will get you the Sanjeevani too. He is Lord Hanuman's helper, who will get you the Sanjeevani too. You are the first new delicate branch and the mother of the jungle will take care of you. You are the first new delicate branch and the mother of the jungle will take care of you. Our garden is full of oneness, respect compassion and motherhood. Ours is a small family. This is our world. If Lord Ram is found then why does one want Sita. I have started taking tension for tomorrow The love that has blossomed from two to three. The love that has blossomed from two to three. The life has now become colourful. Ours is a small family. This is our world. The elephant also has a school. Learnt Iessons in the field. The elephant also has a school. Learnt Iessons in the field. The lakes and waterfalls speak. Even the lion shake hands. The prince is the twinkle of our eyes. Our son is like the Sun. Our mother and father are like God. Every animal of the jungle is dear to us. Ours is a small family. This is our world. Ours is a small family. This is our world. Father, which leg should I first step out with? Should it be right or left? Put forth that leg with which you won't hurt yourself and you don't fall on your face flat. Fine then. You must step out first. Stop! Stop! Wait! Aunty! Aunty, very old guests have come. Aunty! Why is this crazy man jumping and screaming? What is this? What did you do? For what occasion are you welcoming me? You are adding fire to pyre. You are adding more fuel to the fire. Hey you fool, stop playing the tape recorder. Just shut up. Because of which joy, have you done all this? Have we won a war? Uncle, going for a war or to a prison is the same thing. In war one has to work with bullets and in prison one has to work with the stone grinder. Shut up, you scoundrel! Why are scolding him? He has done all this for your happiness. For my happiness? Yes. After leaving from jail, we thought we would go home quietly. No one would even come to know about it. But this one did this drama and made everyone aware. See, in today's world this is what you reap if you do good to people. I have been fasting for the last three days and I have made all the preparations. And he has already called me scoundrel, rascal etc. One must not play a song either to welcome you or on your death. Be quiet son be quiet! They don't care for a diamond like you. Let's go. Come inside come inside Son. Ravi! Stop! Stop son! Son, don't trouble your mother like this. Stop! Son! My dear son, please have your food. No! First Ram will eat, and only then I will. First you eat dear then we'll feed Ram later. First Ram then me. Okay. Dear son, you and Ram can eat together. You make Ram eat and mother will make you eat. Is that fine? Fine. Eat the bananas, or else die. Bunty dear, eat the bananas. Ram, eat properly, then we shall play. You also eat properly. Open your mouth. Uncle Sukha, are you feeding Bansi with bananas? Yes, junior Master! I am feeding him. If I don't feed him, then he will eat me. Oh Lord! I just smelt it. You are angry thinking that I am eating your share of bananas. Sukha! Yes. If you eat even one of his bananas Sukha due to greed then Bansi will rip both your eyes and your teeth. Yes, he won't leave you. I understood junior Master, I understood. The program of feeding the child is over. Now the program for this child will start. Leave me. That scoundrel officer is still on duty in this jungle. That rascal, had to be on duty in this jungle itself. My ball my ball my ball! You son of a rascal! Why do you throw ball on elder people? You filthy creature! Why do you come in the way of small children's games? Did you hear Nagendar? I call him a kitten and he calls me a filthy creature. Nagendar! Yes! Deflate his ball. No! No! Return my ball! Return my ball! My ball! No! My ball no don't do it! Why? Hasn't your pride gone down now? Bansi, remove the air from their tyres. Now hasn't your pride gone down? You rascal! You get a monkey and show your smartness! Ram! Ram! Come quick Ram! Hit him Ram! Hit him! Ram stop! Go back! Pooja! What happened son? Mother, they tore my ball and even hit me. And that's why Ram attacked them. So he is your son. That is why he is so proud. He is just like his mother. No. He is Iike his brave father. From a very young age, he knows which person should be given how much of respect. Look Pooja! Don't' talk too much. If I want, in minutes I can finish the both of you. Shut up! Pooja! You take Ravi and leave. Sher Singh! Despite breaking stones for six years in prison and having dry breads, you all haven't changed. Animals are made to understand by hitting them And humans are made to understand by telling them only once. If you all haven't understood till now then consider your luck ruined. Raja Raja Raja! Whenever I hear this name Raja my entire body fumes up with hatred. A fire of revenge! Till yesterday, we used to rule here but today Raja is the king. His wife thinks that she is the queen of this palace. His son thinks of him as a prince here. He argues with everyone. Father! He was talking to us in a very insulting manner as if we are some stray dogs from the street. He was abusing us using such foul words as if we are not human beings but dead snakes. If you just give me the permission I will kill their entire family. No! Absolutely not! If you kill his entire family, then the law will understand that we killed them to take revenge of the fact that he had put us behind bars. So then? Should we just sit doing nothing about it? Not at all. This is not the time to use force but the mind. I have a new plan creeping up in my mind. Which plan? Raja's elephant, Ram. What if we use him to take the revenge? Junior Master! Ram's food is ready, come out quickly. This Ram won't eat from my hands. If you feed him only then will he eat. Come out quickly! Yes, I am coming Sukha uncle. Fine. I shall get Ram. Come Ram, come. Come Ram, have food. Junior Master, you feed Ram, I shall get the meal prepared for Bansi. How cool is this! I wish even I was a tamed pet like them. It would be really great. Everyone would feed me then. You are fortunate. Really fortunate! Eat it Ram, have your meal nicely. Here have some more. They are good right? Why are you sitting down? Come on, get up. I will go get the ball. Father, by now that elephant must have eaten that poisoned meal. Because of the effect of that poison he must have killed every member of Raja's family. Ram why have you lied down? Come on get up, we shall play. Come we will play. You hit me. Now wait and watch what I do to you. Ravi! Dear dear Ravi. Dear Ravi. Ram! What is wrong with you? Have you lost it? Come on, go inside the shed. Oh my God! He really has lost it. Madam! Madam! No! No! This is the tank. Don't! Our elephant Ram, has gone mad. He wants to kill Ravi. He picked up Ravi and threw him. He is destroying all the things around. You please come fast. Ram Ram, what has happened to you? At least let us know. Guards, catch him. Hurry up! Sukha, quickly call up the veterinary hospital. Yes. The elephant lost it's mental balance by eating poisonous food. And that is why it did all this. What? Yes, Mr. Raja. But there is nothing to worry about now. I have given an antidote. The elephant would be fine in two to four days. If you want, you can take him after half an hour. Ram, what did you do? What happened to you? You picked up and threw junior Master. You crashed pots of flowers. You uprooted the plants too. Isn't this wrong? Despite knowing this, then why did you do it? Stop it Sukha! Don't blame him any more. He is anyway regretting on his act. Don't worry Ramu. You are innocent. You are not responsible for whatever happened. We will go home in some time. Wait! What happened Pooja? First take him away from here. I can't stand his face. Pooja doctor informed us that there was poison mixed with his meal. Because of which he Iost his mental balance and did all these acts. What if he goes mad with some other reason, then what will happen to my child? I love my child more than him. I can't sacrifice my child's life for such an animal. He won't stay in the house that we live in. Pooja! Don't talk Iike fools! Have you forgotten his debts? First he saved my life, then he saved you from getting raped. He Ioves Ravi more than us. It will never happen, that a loyal animal will have to Ieave from this house because of just a mistake. Ram will stay here with us! Fine then. Then I won't stay here. It seems you instead of the elephant, have gone mad. And that's why in haste, without a thought you are taking such a foolish step like this. Haste is my habit. Every decision in life I have taken in haste. I left my house and came to the jungle in haste. In haste, I fell in love with you. In haste itself I went against my father's wish to marry you. Pooja! Yes. I made a huge mistake by loving a person who stayed amongst animals in the jungle. Because you treasure animals more. You don't love humans. You love them more than your wife and son. There is no difference between you and animals. Shut up! You raised your hand on me because of an animal. This slap has now proved that you Iove animals more than us. Fine. Now Ravi and me won't live here for even a second. Pooja! Pooja! You have done every thing in life in a hurry. But to leave your husband's house is not a joke. The bond between husband and wife is not like a weak thread that you can break it whenever you wish. Then even you understand, that wife is not an animal that you can tie her down with chains. Nor is she a slave, whom you can hit. Is this your final decision? Sukha, leave her to her father's house. But Sir Do what I have asked you to do. After causing all the destruction after ruining my house what have you come to take now? I am leaving this house. Now you and your Master can live here happily. Move away from my way. Move away! Ram move I ask you to move! Come on. Yes father, that poor chap is heart broken! His wife took his child with herself. And while leaving she insulted him too. He is now gone mad and started banging into trees. Rascal! Listen Son, there is nothing difficult about killing your enemy. Kill his mental peace. When the mental peace dies, the man is alive but he dies while he is living and lives while he is dying. See, I remember thirty years back. Oh no! When I was a part of the party I used to sleep on barren lands and eat very meagrely. Stop it father! Please stop it! For God sake don't repeat this story ever again. From the plants and trees to the animals of the jungle remember it. Do one thing, get it published in some book. Father, when you will pass away then I will read it when I am alone. Ram, if you don't eat then how will you stay alive? You are not responsible for whatever has happened. Ram, if you don't eat then Master and me both won't eat. Do you want everyone to starve? Then why don't you eat the food? You are missing Ravi and Pooja, isn't it? They will come back in a few days. If if we can't stay without them then even they won't be able to stay without us. Ram, eat your meal. Come on Ram. Finish your meal, you hungry Ram. It is the duty of Lord to bring back happiness. Have your food dear. No, I don't want to eat. See, good kids don't behave stubbornly. If you won't have food quickly then how will you become big? Come on, eat. I told you all that I won't eat. First get me the elephant only then will I eat. You want an elephant. Bhola! Yes. Get an elephant for him. Yes, I will get it right away. The elephant came! When did it come? Yes, it must have come when I was asleep, didn't it? Here is the elephant. Yuck! I don't want an elephant that is a toy. I want an elephant who is my friend, which is Ram! Ram? For what do you need Ram? So that he can kill us with his feet. Have you forgotten, what he did to you when you were feeding him? Mummy, that was just a game. We keep pushing each other when we play. I want my friend Ram! Stop your nonsense! Just have your food quietly. I won't eat. Won't you eat? Pooja! What are you doing? If he is not hungry now, he will eat later. Bhola! Yes. Take Ravi outside to play. Yes. Master, there is a letter for you. A letter? From where? The senior officer from the headquarters has sent it. Today he has wished you on your wedding anniversary. Greetings? Yes sometime back we had taken promises to stay together in this house, on this day. Those promises have broken. Master, may be if I speak then I would be talking too much. But the fights between a couple are like the rains in summer, they never last for long. Master, if you yourself go and get Madam back then there would be joy back in this sad house. Sukha, I had not asked her to leave the house and go. She left herself. And I don't think she would come back on my request. She is very stubborn. She will never come back. Now may Lord get both of them back together. I see the devotees have come. I am coming, coming. Give it, give it. This is nice! Gajaraj and Hanuman have come themselves for a visit. But on whose name should the prayer be done? Should it be done for both of you? Wow! Hanuman has a letter in his hand. Give it to me. Mr. and Mrs. Raja. It means that the prayer should be done for these both. Isn't it? I shall do it right away. Oh Lord! Whatever these innocent animals wish, grant them that wish. What are you doing? I am removing the towel. Let go, you shameless! What is shameless about this? This towel is for wiping and not for wearing. And to cover this beautiful body I have got you this new sari. Wow! What is so wow about it? Wear it! First you have to go outside. Why should I go out? Today is our marriage anniversary. We must be together. So? So so I will go to the court. And the outcome would be to make your wife wear a sari with your own hands. Okay. Fine. I will wear it. Quickly, Hurry up! My heart desires to be a scarf around you. So that I can always be draped around you. My heart desires to be a scarf around you. So that I can always be draped around you. You are softer than flowers. You are hotter than flames. You are very shameless. You just be away. My heart desires to be a scarf around you. So that I can always be draped around you. You are softer than flowers. You are hotter than flames. You are very shameless. You just be away. I worship you, I bow down to you. I think about you all day and night. I worship you, I bow down to you. I think about you all day and night. I sway when I see your face. I would be an earring so that I can kiss your cheeks. I would be around you. You are softer than flowers. You are hotter than flames. You are very shameless. You just be away. My heart desires to be a scarf around you. So that I can always be draped around you. You are softer than flowers. You are hotter than flames. You are very shameless. You just be away. We will maintain the boundaries of society. We will love each other secretly. We will maintain the boundaries of society. We will love each other secretly. We won't ruin our marriage. We will love each other openly. We will remain lovers for the rest of our lives. You are softer than flowers. You are hotter than flames. You are very shameless. You just be away. My heart desires to be a scarf around you. So that I can always be draped around you. You are softer than flowers. You are hotter than flames. You are very shameless. You just be away. Hey man? Come here. No man. You come here. Glad to meet you. I am Jackson from America. I am Budhiram from here. Very happy Mr. Budhi. You want to play marbles? No not now. First, I want to meet Mr. Sher Singh. Sher Singh? Yes. You mean my uncle? Yes, your uncle. Where is he? Once upon a time, uncle Sher Singh and brother Nagendar, they went inside. They started grinding in prison. Big criminals, they wanted to create history in crime. You bloody son of a snake. In my absence, why are you telling my prison history like a Ramayan? Tell your own unfortunate story. Mr. Jackson, he has failed He has failed 1 3 times in S.S.L.C. Ya ya. This rascal eats five times a day. Ya ya. No, no. Get out! Come inside. For this statue, there is demand from America, Holland, London, Paris, from everywhere. I have promised them to supply this statue. I want this immediately. Nagendar, it looks as if I have seen this statue somewhere. You have seen it here, in this jungle. This is a goddess of the tribe Mangola. Correct! Correct! I had got information that this statue is with the tribal people that stay here. Mr. Sher Singh, if you get me this statue I will give you 25 lakhs. Okay, I will give you 30 lakhs. But I want this statue within seven days. 7 days. Why 7 days we will get you this statue within 3 days. Three days. Okay. It's a deal. Just order Sir! Rudra does all work in a jiffy.

Nothing will happen to Ravi, I will just call up the zoo officer. Ravi. Yes, we have just got the news that the monkey and elephant have taken the child towards the jungle.

Pooja, if you love Ravi like a mother then Ram loves Ravi more than you. You don't worry. Ram must be coming here with Ravi. No!

Even we will go and hide. Let's go. Leave me! Leave me! Just shut up! Come. Good job, son. Good job! You have caught this sneaky little child so smartly that now even his father will be in our custody. Father, open the door. Just a minute dear! Come on. What are you doing here? Just give me your hand. Not yours, catch my hand. What are you doing here? Till today I was under the impression that you are a thief of the jungle. But today I got to know that you are a kidnapper. You have a son who is as big as a donkey's size And you have such a sweet nephew. Then what will you with this child? You fool, you foolish person, speak softly! If you speak loudly, the wild animals will hear and my entire plan will get ruined. Let it get ruined! Let it get ruined. Where are you taking this child? You foolish person, you won't understand. Don't interfere in my matter! I will interfere in every matter. I will interfere everywhere, in the front, back, top and down. First let go off the child. Let go! Father! At this moment I will forget that he is my blood relation and kill him. Come on, what can you do to me? Before that I will kill you. Budhi, I will really murder you. What will you do? Budhi! Wait Nagendar. Dear Budhi, do you want me leave this child? Yes. If I leave him, will you take him with you? Fine. Dear Nagendar leave the child. But father. Leave! He doesn't listen to a father. Nagendar, leave the child. Did you wink? No. Come dear. Don't panic, I will protect you. Pick him up and load him into the car. Mummy! Daddy! Daddy! Listen, that's Ravi's voice. Mummy! Come quick! Mummy! Daddy! It seems like Ravi's life is in danger. Mummy! Come quick! Mummy! Daddy! Why? On hearing your beloved child's voice you came running like mad man Say did you like your beloved child's voice? Sher Singh, first tell me where is my son? I will tell you, definitely I will. But before that I will like to tell you a story. Once, one of our people, had stolen a statue of a goddess from the tribal people and was coming to us. You caught him and took back the statue to the tribal people. And today, you are going to get that statue for us. And if you refuse to do so, then I will kill your son. Sher Singh! Shut up! Don't you dare touch me, damn it! Raja, get that statue and give it to him somehow. For God sake, save Ravi! Raja say yes. Please! Fine, I will get you the statue. But before that tell me where is my son? My son will tell you the address of your son. Give the statue on one hand and take your son on another. But Mr. Raja, don't be sly. Understood? Nagendar, follow him like a shadow. Villains in films have such hideouts. It means my uncle and Nagendar are villains in a human film. Despite going to prison, they haven't changed. What is this monkey doing here? Uncle, this is our Bansi. Humans acted like monkeys and tied us here. Whereas monkeys have acted like the humans and freed us. Thank you father! Thank you. Bansi, go get Ram here soon. Who is Ram? Is he your servant? No, he is my friend the elephant. Only an elephant can teach those culprits a good lesson. Then we can punish them too. Go, and get your big father. Justice duty and law you used to talk very highly of these three words, isn't it? But today when it at the cost of your son's life you have forgotten all those things. Isn't it? Dear Ravi! Ravi dear! Uncle, why are you calling out with such sweetness? You son of a donkey, even your mom call out so sweetly. Ravi dear! Come. Mummy! Mummy! Ravi, my son! Sher Singh here is your statue. Now we will Ieave. Wait! Officer, dear officer, where are you going? What do you mean? I mean you were not called here to Ieave but to be send you somewhere else. See Sher Singh, we had a deal with you. Which deal are you talking about? Have you thought of this place as a market where deals take place. No! No! This is Sher Singh's den! Den! Here human lives are traded. Do you understand? One must be a fool, to let go of an enemy like you. You have hurt me, given me a lot of trouble. You have made me loose many lacs. You sent me to prison. Prison! Dear Nagendar! Do you remember dear, you always wanted to finish this family? So see, this family is here. Finish them. Stick a death stamp on their lives and mail it to heaven. Today my dream of so many years will come true. Wait! Wait! This statue is fake. It's a duplicate! You sly, fraud, con! These words don't seem right coming from you Sher Singh. Sher Singh, I have cheated that person who is cheating the entire world. I had got this fake statue from the head of the tribe. So that I could show your true colours to everyone. Fine. You did what you wanted to. Now you see what I do. Come on take away the child. No! Leave my child! Mummy! Come with me. Uncle, this is injustice, betrayal. I will hand you over to the police. Mummy! Mummy! Put him inside. Ravi! Mr. Raja, look at how good this scene is. Your child and the lion's hungry child are trapped in the same cage. And see, that lion's child is looking at your child hungrily. Get me the real statue and take your son with you. Never. So then its fine. I will do one thing. If you don't leave till the count of 1 0 I will lift the barrier between your child and the lion's cub. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Mummy! Ten! Please go! Lift the barrier. Mummy! Mummy! Let go. Ravi dear! Give me! No! Ravi! Leave me, you dog, you rascal! Here have this drink. Go! Come Devdas, come. Help! Father! Officer! My son died. Today, you will know how a father feels on his son's death. I will kill your son you just watch. Ram! Ram! Get up! Did you see that? This is called sacrifice. This speechless animal loved everyone. And you hated him. No! Thinking that he wanted to kill your child. And today, he has given his life for your son's life. Ram, what has happened to you? Come we will play. Ram! Ram get up! Ram! Daddy! What happened to Ram? Why isn't he getting up? Son, come on eat your food. No. First Ram will eat and then I will. Ram, he is. What about Ram? Where is my Ram? Son, Ram will come. First you eat your food. Pooja, don't worry. Look there. Doctor Bansi, is getting Ram here. Ram! Ram! Ram, are you fine now? Yes, junior Master! The doctors of the hospital and the doctor of the jungle, Mr. Bansi, everyone have cured him. How would he not recover? Ask. I want a leave for a year. For one year, but why? I want to go and stay in the jungle. Why? You intend to go for meditation. No, I want to stay with my Gilli. And will come back after a year with a new born child. But why do you need to go the jungle for this? You can give birth to the child in the house also. No! PIease excuse me! I can't do anything with Bansi and Ram in the house. And Bansi is so smart, that he will open the window and come inside and click a picture.
