In the reign of Henry VIII... when the monasteries in England were dissolved... and the occupants tortured... beheaded in public or murdered secretly... some went into hiding to worship as they pleased. It is the decaying bodies and skeletons of these religious martyrs... that you will see on your tour. These catacombs are dangerous. And I must warn you to stay with me... and not lose your way. Please keep close together. - My brooch! - Hmm? I must have dropped it somewhere. [Sighs] Thank you. Well, which way shall we go? Well, it's a toss-up. Let's try this way. - Dead end. - Sorry. Wrong guess. [Banging] [Door Scraping Ground] Well, there's no way out of here. Let's go back. [Door Scraping Ground] There's no way out there. - Who are you? - Where did you come from? All in good time. Look, how do we get out of here? - All in good time. - I'm in a hurry! It can wait. - It really can't wait. I have an appointment. - Sit. All of you. Please sit down. Sit down. I assure you, I have a purpose. What purpose? Why did you come in here? I don't know. I was just driving by and... something made me. And what are your plans when you leave here? Plans? Plans. //[Choir Singing] "ToJoanne. The best wife in the world. Love from Richard." And a big kiss. //[Choir Continues] - [Thudding] - [Grunting] //[Choir Continues] Merry Christmas. //[Choir Continues] //[Ends] [Girl] Mummy! Mummy! Just a minute, darling. Mummy will be right up. //[Choir Resumes Singing On Radio] - Mummy! - I'm coming, Carol! - Carol, darling, what's the matter? - Did Santa come yet? No, darling, not yet. You be a good girl and go on to sleep. - Can I see him when he comes? - We'll see. Now you be a good girl and go to sleep. Otherwise, Santa won't come. - What's this? - Nothing. Just a Christmas card from Daddy. - All right? Good night. - Good night, Mummy. - Night, Daddy! - [Door Closes] //[Choir Continues Singing] [Man On Radio] We interrupt this program for a special announcement. A man described as a homicidal maniac... has escaped from the hospital for the criminally insane. He is 6 foot 3 inches tall... 210 pounds, dark eyes, bald... and may be wearing a Santa Claus costume... taken from a shop in Burley. All residents of the county are warned to be on the lookout for this man... and to phone the police if they see him. We now continue our program of carols for Christmas eve. //[Organ] //[Choir Singing] [Bell Jingling] [Knocking] [Doorknob Rattling] //[Choir Continues] - [Grunting] - [Screams] //[Choir Continues] //[Ends] ## [Organ] [Footsteps] //[Choir Singing] Blood. //[Choir Continues] //[Ends] //[Choir Singing] [Footsteps] //[Choir Continues] [Gasps] Carol.

I have no inten- Hadn't you? And you? I'm on my way home to see my wife and children. - And then? - Hmm? And then? And then? //[Easy Listening] - Well, I'm all set. - Must you go tonight, Carl? Can't you leave it till the morning? No, I'm afraid I can't. My appointment's in the morning. I'll have to drive all night to make it. When will you be back? I, uh- I don't know. We'll have to see how it works out. I'll, um- I'll phone you. Did you say good night to the kids? No. I was just going to. Good night, Daddy. Good-bye, darling. Don't forget to ring me when you get there. I will. Good-bye, darling. - Bye. Drive carefully. - Yes, right. [Sets Parking Brake] The removal men came this morning. Yeah, well, so I see. - It should all be there by the time we get there. - Yeah. - A shame to give up a nice flat like this. - Yes, I know that, darling. But we've both had to give up quite a bit, haven't we? I love you, Susan. You know that, don't you? Yes, of course I do. You meet someone, and suddenly that's it. I kissed my kids tonight and- and- Oh, for hell's sake! I mean, it will be worth it, won't it, for both of us? Of course it will. You are tired. Let me drive. Yeah, okay. No. No. No. No! No. No. No! I'm sorry. Bad dream. [Horn Honking] - Look out! - [Tires Screeching] [Screaming] [Loud Crashing] [Shuddering] Susan. Susan, where are you? [Gasping] [Screaming] You crazy fool! Do you want to get yourself kill- [Panting] [Footsteps Approaching] - Darling. - [Screams] [Gasping] [Gasps] [Woman Sobbing] What's the matter then? Look. - Well, pull yourself together. What's the matter? - [Sobbing] Come on now. [Doorbell Buzzing] - Yes? - Susan! - Who is it? - It's me, Carl. Carl? Carl- It can't be. "Can't be"? What do you mean? Carl was- Where have you been? Please go away. Look, I've been worried out of my mind. What's happened? The furniture. I don't understand. How'd it- I brought it back after the crash. - Huh? - And I was blinded. Blinded? And Carl was killed. Killed? Two years ago. [Screaming] I'm sorry. Bad dream. [Horn Honking] - Look out! - [Tires Screeching] [Screaming] [Loud Crashing] So that is why you were in a hurry? - To leave your wife and children? - What do you mean? How do you- Who are you? I assure you, I have a purpose. - What sort of game are you playing? - Game? You're trying to frighten us in some way. What do you want? To show you something. Something in your own mind. Something you are capable of doing. I don't wanna know. Oh, but you must know. You must. [Children Chattering, Laughing] [Chattering, Laughter Continue] Thank you. - We knew it was you. - You knew it was me? Dear old Punch though, he's very nice, isn't he? Ah, I know some of you have to get home rather soon. So there's your little present, my dear. There. - Thank you, Mr. Grimsdyke. - That's all right. Now shall I tell you something? My wife's name was Helen. Mary Helen Grimsdyke. I always called her Helen. It's a nice name, isn't it? Yeah. - Bye-bye then. - Come on, Mark. Come on, Julie. Come and sit here. Bye-bye, Mark. Bye-bye, Julie. - [Barking] - Bye. Bye. Two little dickey birds sitting on a wall. One named Peter. One named Paul. Fly away, Peter. Fly away, Paul. Come back, Peter. Come back, Paul. That's it. [Laughs] You think you could do that? [Chattering] What are you looking at? Grimsdyke, of course. His usual shell out to the kids. He does it every year on his birthday. - I don't know how you stand it. - Stand what? Living across the road from that man. He's a rubbish collector. A dustman. His place is an eyesore. The toys he give those kids he finds in the rubbish heap and repairs. - Why doesn't he sell out? - I've made him offers. He's- He's sentimental about that old dump. Says he and his wife lived there for their whole married life. And now he wants to die there, just as she did. Well, it ruins the neighborhood and depreciates the value of our property. The inside must be like a pigsty. He owns the place free and clear. Nothing we can do about it. - Bye-bye. See you tomorrow. Shut the gate. - [Barking] Bye-bye. Isn't there? [Footsteps In Distance] What on earth have you been doing? Somebody's just made an awful mess of Mr. Baker's garden. Poor Grimsdyke's neighbor. He was so proud of his prize roses. [Man] My prize roses. Years ofhard work. It's Grimsdyke's dogs for sure. This is too much. I'd like to make an official complaint. - [Whimpers] - But you mustn't take them away. They're my friends. Sergeant, please. It's a court order, and they don't have licenses. - I couldn't afford licenses. - I'm sorry, Mr. Grimsdyke. Sergeant, please. - [Dogs Whimpering] - [Door Closing] [Van Departs] Darling. Darling? Are you there, darling? Are you there, darling? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Is there any- anything you wish to tell me? Ah! [Shudders] Give me the message. D- D- Wait. Danger. Danger? Who to? Who to? Is it one of the children? Who to? Just think it over, Councillor Ramsey. Grimsdyke's due to retire in two years. He's done his job well. There's no reason why the town council- He's too old. Don't you think a younger man- He'd lose his retirement pay. And save the town some money. Poor old Grimsdyke. I do believe he's out of a job. Hmm. Flowers are a little wilted, aren't they, my dear? God bless you. Plenty more in the garden. I'll get you some tomorrow. [Dog Barking] Oh! - [Chuckling] - [Barking] Jamie! Jamie! My littleJamie. Oh, I wondered where you were. Oh, I'm so glad they didn't get you. Welcome home. Oh. Better save money now, hadn't we? Hey, look. Helen, look who's come back. Our littleJamie. Ah, that's wonderful. You're our only friend now. You and the children. We thought it might be neighborly to let you know what was going on. It's very kind of you to draw our attention to this, Mr. Elliot. It's so difficult to know what one's children get up to when they're out of one's sight. After all, last year I remember- You can tell from looking at his house what a filthy old man he is. Constantly filling it with children. Heaven knows what his motivations are. Now don't forget what I said. Just stay away from him. But, Mummy, he's such a nice old man. Don't argue with me. You're not to see him again ever. Why don't you go and play in our garden? And don't take any more sweets from him. Carrying rubbish all day. His house must be filthy. You and your Mr. Grimsdyke. Now, remember, I don't want you to go anywhere near him. - Oh, Mum- - And that's final. I don't understand it. Everyone was so kind. [Sniffles] Now this. No work. No children. No one to make toys for. Well, never mind. We've always got each other, haven't we, my dear? Mmm. That's all that matters. Just one more turn of the screw... and he'll sell his property for next to nothing. What's on your mind? Valentine's Day. - It's just two weeks away. - So? We'll send him valentines... from everyone in town. - Oh. - Lots of mail for you today, Mr. Grimsdyke. Good morning. Thank you very much. Well, how very kind. My dear, look. It's not even Christmas, is it? Not that it makes any difference if it is or not. Who could be writing to us? Let's see here. Oh! It's a valentine card. But you're my only sweetheart. Who can this be? "Noisy are children, loud is a bell... pungent is perfume, but you only smell." Hmm? "Noisy are children, loud is a bell... pungent is perfume, but you only smell." Why, I don't think I like that. Let's see what we have here. "A tree is beautiful if its owner prunes it... "but our town isn't... 'cause your presence ruins it." Oh. [Opening Envelope] "Some people live in the country. "Some people live in the town. "Why don't you do us a service? Jump in the river and-" [Dog Howling] [Howling Continues] What's Grimsdyke been doing to that mongrel? He hasn't stopped whining for a week. You know, come to think of it... I haven't seen Grimsdyke for days. Not since Valentine's Day. He can't be far away if the door's open. This place is spotless. I thought it'd be filthy. [Creaking] [Man] "But the merciful goodness of the Lord endureth forever and ever... - [Whining] - "upon them that fear him... "and his righteousness upon his children's children. "For as much as it hath pleased Almighty God ofhis great mercy... to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother"- Arthur Edward Grimsdyke. "Here departed. "We therefore commit his body to the ground. - "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes... - [Dirt Falling On Coffin] "dust to dust. "In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life... through our Lord Jesus Christ"- It was kind of you to pay for the burial. It was the least I could do. He was a neighbor. What's that? Valentine's cards. The ones left over from last year when- - Must be a year ago. - Today. It's Valentine's Day. February the 14th. Ayear ago exactly. [Sighs] I'm going to bed. See you in the morning. Night. Night. [Screaming] "You were mean... "and cruel... "right from the start. "Now you really have... no"- [Screams] It's true. It's true. I didn't- don't like Grimsdyke. What am I doing here? [Monk] You'll see. [Door Opens, Closes] Well, that's it, Ralph, I'm afraid. It's all gone. - Everything? - More than everything. You have debts. I did warn you, didn't I, not to use the money that had been entrusted to you? - The risks were far too great. - The risks? The gains could've been enormous. [Sighs] What do I do now? Well, you have two choices. First, bankruptcy. And according to you, that would be dishonorable, wouldn't it? Oh, come on. Let's face it. You've done dishonorable things in your life before, in your business life. Hard, ruthless- oh, perhaps even cruel. Yes, to build up theJason empire, sometimes I had to be. - No one has to be. - I did. Oh, it's easy to talk, but I had to fight my way up the hard way. If people got hurt, they got hurt. But I always paid my debts. No, I'm not going into bankruptcy. Well, if you intend to try and pay off your debts... you'll have to start selling things, things of value- properties, your paintings- everything. My house? All the beautiful things I've acquired during the years? It's the only way. I won't do it. I'm afraid you'll have to. So, there's nothing else for it. We have to sell. Oh, I know it's a blow. Our whole life's in them. Everything we've collected all over the world. I remember that one. We got it in that strange shop in Hong Kong... when you were selling guns to- Do you remember what the little man in the shop said to us when he sold it to us? Yes. "Use it"- "Use it wisely." Hmm! I wonder what he meant by that. Ralph, have you- have you ever seen this writing that's inscribed on the bottom of this statuette? - Writing? - Hmm, yes, here at the base. "Three wishes I give and no more... "to each owner of me... "so keep score. "Each wish will come true... so take care what you do." I can't read the rest, but the last word is... - "deplore." - What does it all mean? "Use it wisely." If only it could give us three wishes. That's storybook nonsense. - But it reminds me of a tale I once read. What was it? - We could pay all our debts. - "The Monkey's Paw." That's what it was. - I wish- I read it when I was at school. I wish for lots and lots of money. - Oh, no, no! - Too late. I already have. And I've just remembered what happened at the end of the story. Why, you said yourself, it was just a story- - like our three wishes. - [Phone Ringing] Hello? Oh, hello, Charles. - I'd like you to come down to my office. - What, right now? - Yes, straightaway. - What's it all about? It's very important. It's about money. I'd like you to come straightaway. I'll be right there. That's Charles. He wants me to go and see him right away. - He said something about money. - Money? [Birds Chirping] - Maybe our wish will come true after all. - [Car Engine Starting] [Rings] - Hello? - [Man On Phone] Is that Mr. Gregory? - Yes, yes, speaking. - I'm sorry to tell you, sir, but your client, Ralph Jason... has been killed in a car crash. - In his car? - Yes, on the road about 10 miles from his home. Well, uh, have you told Enid- Mrs. Jason yet? No, not yet. We found some letters from you in his pocket. They indicate that you're not only his solicitor but a close friend of the family. We thought it better that you break the news. Yes, yes. Yes, of course. Leave it to me. - I'll tell her. - Thank you, sir. Ralph? Dead? They found him in the wreckage of his car. He'd obviously lost control, skidded. [Sobbing] Enid, this may not be the best moment to talk about this, but, uh... it may alleviate some of your other worries. You realize this accident makes you a rich woman. Rich? Ralph's insurance. He always carried a large policy... with a double indemnity against accident. Oh, Charles, I wished for lots and lots of money. Ralph warned me not to. - No, that's a coincidence, surely. - No, it's no coincidence. That statuette- It gave us three wishes. I used one of them to wish for lots and lots of money. Now I'm going to wish for Ralph back. Charles. Do you know the story of"The Monkey's Paw"? That's the story of the old couple who are given a monkey's paw... which entitles them to three wishes. They wish for money, and they get the money... because their son is killed... in a machine in his factory, crushed. - Enid. You mustn't wish Ralph back. - Why not? Well, in the story, this mother wishes her son back, and he does come back... but in the condition in which he died- mutilated, mangled, torn. [Enid] I must be careful not to make the same mistake. I shall wish that Ralph were back as he was before the accident. I wish... Ralph were back exactly as he was... immediately before the accident. [Pounding] [Pounding] - Open it! Quickly! - No, no. Don't look. His body was mangled in the crash. Mangled? It wasn't mangled. Mr. Jason died of a heart attack at the wheel. [Door Closes] I wished to bring him back as he was immediately before the accident. But he was already dead- dead from a heart attack. So the accident didn't kill him. - Only one more wish. - Enid- - Please go away. Leave me alone. - Please- I want to be alone with him, please. Only one more wish. Only one. I mustn't waste it. I must be careful. Oh, please, please... I wish Ralph were alive now. I don't want him to die ever. I want him moving, breathing, talking, alive- now, forever! [Screaming] - Ralph! - Oh, Enid! Ralph! Charles! - Help me! - What's happened? - Oh! - [Charles] What have you done? I wished alive again- forever! Don't you realize he's been embalmed? His veins are filled with embalming fluid... - burning into him! - Oh, no! [Sobbing] Enid! Do something! [Screaming Continues] For God's sake, Enid! Help me! No, no! Enid, don't! - Aah! Aah! - [Enid Grunting] But don't you see? You wished him alive forever! You can't kill him! Every piece ofhim is alive still! Alive and- and suffering... forever. [Sobbing] [Man] Well, what did you see? - What did he see? - What's more important is what you will see. Who are you? What do you want with us? - To warn you of what may happen. - I don't care about your warnings. - I want to get out of here. - Very well. But you should heed the warning. [Panting] [Birds Chirping] [Parking Brake Cranks] - Mr. Rogers? - Major Rogers. Show me to my quarters and have somebody get my kit in, will you? - Shane, here. - [Barking] Good boy. [Clanks] There were pictures on the wall. Where have they gone? Personal property of your predecessor, sir. Well, we must get some more. I'll go down to London, have a look around the galleries. Where are the men- uh, the patients? They've gone to lunch, sir. You mean dinner, don't you? Bon apptit, Mr. Carter. Thank you, Harry. [Men Chattering] [Man Coughs] Good morning. My name is Rogers. Major William Rogers. I've been appointed your new superintendent here, and take up my duties today. I've had considerable experience in dealing with men as an officer in the army. I promise you I will do this job to the best of my ability. I hope we'll all get along well. If there are any complaints... I shall be pleased to deal with them in my office at any time. - Good morning. - [All Mumbling] Good morning. Morning. - Shane. - [Barking] [Door Closes] Well, Shane... after I've made a few changes... I think we're gonna like it here. [Wind Whistling] Stone cold. - It's always like that now. - [Coughing] [Wheezing] All right, old boy? All right. I'll get you an extra blanket. - [Knocking] - Yes? The men have asked me to come and talk to you. Yes? It's about the heating. It's been very cold these past few nights. We wondered if you- For reasons of economy, the heating is now turned off each evening at 2000 hours. You should all be in bed by then. After all, there's no point in staying up. - You can't see anything. - The beds are cold. There aren't enough blankets. I'm trying to run this place as efficiently and as economically as I can. I'm afraid the current budget does not include the costs of new blankets. Do you know anything about blind people? No, I can't say I do, until I took over this job. But I was in the army for over 20 years, and I learned to handle all kinds of men there. With all due respect, sir, we are not soldiers. And blind people are not like people with sight. We have lost one sense... but the loss of that one sense only tends to sharpen the others. Do you know what that means? We feel things more acutely. If food is bad, it tastes worse to us. If a room is dirty, we feel every speck. If an insect scurries across the floor, we hear it. And if it's cold, we feel the cold more. Why don't you sell that painting and buy us fuel or extra blankets? I was not aware that the administration of expenditure for this establishment... had been handed over to you, Mr. Carter. Good morning. [Door Slams] - Dishwater. - Filthy muck. There's no meat in it. Sorry, dad, there ain't no more. No second helping? Well, rations were cut, you see? Superintendent says he's doing the best he can with prices so high. It's customary to knock on the door of a private office. What do you want? Can't you see I'm having my lunch? What is it? Nice juicy steak, while we get nothing but slop? I do the best I can for you within the limits of the budget provided for me. - But you eat meat... and drink wine. - I am the officer in charge. - This isn't the bloody army! - Mr. Carter! In the kingdom of the blind, even the one-eyed man is king. - Shane! - [Barking] Shane, stay. Here. [Gasping] [Wheezing] [Coughing] Doctor. Get a doctor. Do you realize it's gone midnight? Doctor! Who wants a doctor? It's Greenwood, sir. Well, can't it wait till the morning? He's ill, sir. Very ill. Well, I suppose I'd better take a look. [Barking] Shane, wait. Blanket. [Wind Whistling] Well, which one is Greenwood? The man is dead. Very well. [Barking] Shane? Shane? Shane? What the hell do you think you're doing? Go back to your rooms, all of you! It's our turn to give the orders now... Major Rogers, sir. Well, what-what is it? What- Wh-What do you want? [Footsteps Approaching] [Chattering, Grunting] [Door Slams] [Pounding] Let me out of here! Let me out! [Shane Whining] - Shane. - [Barking] Shane. All right, boy. All right. All right, boy. What are you doing to my dog? What are you doing to my dog? [Birds Chirping] - [Clattering] - [Shane Growling] [Barking] [Barking In Distance] [Grunting] Let me go! Let me go! [Grunts] Let me go! Let me go! [Grunts] Let me go! [Barking Continues] Your dog seems to be getting hungry, Major Rogers. Feed him, please. Please, feed him. All in good time. Yes, but you must feed him. He- He'll be dangerous. He'll go wild, berserk! I know, Major Rogers, sir. [Barking Continues] [Clattering Continues] What are you... doing out there? You'll see... soon enough. Look, give me something to eat, please. Please! I haven't had anything to eat or drink for over two days. Please, please! Well, at least feed my dog, please! He'll be fed, all right... Major Rogers, sir. [Wood Scraping] [Creaking] [Shane Snarling In Distance] [Creaking] [Screams] Aah! Aah! You- [Snarling] [Barking] No! Shane! [Screams] What is all this? I'm on my way to a new job. I don't know... why I stopped here. I do. Now you may go. [Scraping] [Thunder Rumbling] But how can we- Where are we? In a place where people go who have died without repentance. You see, I wasn't warning you... but telling you why you are here... for all eternity. [Screams] And now... who's next? Perhaps you? [Thunderclap]
