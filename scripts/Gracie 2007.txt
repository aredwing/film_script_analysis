Ten yards out, for you? Come on, man. It's like hitting the side of a barn. Come on, Johnny. We're late. All right. So then, let's sweeten the pot. We'll back it up to twenty, and I won't be the shooter. My sister will be. What? Her? Me? Yeah. Five bucks says it's so cake, even my sister can do it. There's no way I can hit that. She says she can't do it. I'll be right behind you. No, look. What's she doing? Flip-flops. Well, so, take 'em off. #... all your plans # What you tryin' to hand me? Five bucks. One shot. And the chick's gonna shoot barefoot? Her name's Gracie. Yeah, whatever. You're on. It's your money. Okay, see the target? Yeah. You don't want to look at the target. You want to keep your ankle locked... and your toes pointing down. - Got it. - Right. Okay, good. So when you strike the ball... you want to make solid contact with your instep here. You're gonna follow through the target. All right, come on, man. Let's go. Okay. Now, your plant foot... you want to keep even with the ball... and then your kicking foot is gonna go over the ball. It's too much to remember. Don't worry about it. Just wait till you're ready You can do anything. Fun game. What's it called? #Don't look back, a new day is breaking # #It's been too long # Here. #Since I felt this way I don't mind # Johnny, here. Johnny. #Today is the day # Come on, come on. Over here. Whoops. #I'm much too strong not to compromise # Johnny. Here. Whoa. Barefoot? Never a doubt in my mind. You owe me a pair of flip-flops. Let's go. Get back. Get back. Shit. Come on. You got to move your feet faster. Mike, catch up. Cross over. Get moving. That's it. That's it. Where the hell were you? I took off overtime hours. Peter and your brothers made it. All right, Johnny. Let's go. Pass and shoot drill. I'll be the goalie. Mike, Daniel, get in the goal. Hustle, hustle. Here you go, Peter. I want clean passes. That's it. And shot. All right, Johnny, let's see it. And shot. That's it. That's it. I could shag balls. Peter, get it to him. Oh, your mom was calling you before. Shoot, Johnny. That's it. What a shot. Good left foot. Here, honey. Paper says you're gonna beat Kingston. They're gonna take State. It's a done deal. No, no, no. Johnny will take 'em down. They're animals. They're bigger. They're stronger. How's that view from the bench? It's better than yours from the stands. You gotta want it more, Johnny. Here, Dad. But they've got the giant. But he can't play soccer. He just knocks everybody over. No skills. This is our year. Can we talk about something else, please? There is nothing else. Oh, really? We should play a 4-4-2 and double-team that guy McMann? And you read that on what cereal box? Daniel. Questions give the impression one is interested. And you're not interested? To what she says? Girls lose their brains when their boobs grow. Then Grace must be really smart. You guys both took four meatballs. Fill that for her. We played. She didn't. It's not like you eat here every night... just because the food's good. All right, fine. It's her pick then. Take what you want, Grace. I'll take this one. And I'll have this for maximum boob growth. Elmer's hungry, huh? That bird's never gonna fly. Tell him that and he never will. You stretch out? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, don't stretch out too fast, so you don't cramp up. Is Johnny still polishing his cleats? It's been almost an hour already. He does it for luck. He does it because he's afraid to lose. Could have some rain tonight. You know what they do in baseball, of course. They roll out a tarp and everybody goes... to the locker room and put their street clothes on. Not in soccer, you know, you just play through... and in football they just keep stopping. You stretch out yet? Yeah, Dad. Yeah. Well, do it again before the game starts... and just do it slow. You don't want to cramp up. Maybe they'll call it off. All right, let's play some offense here! - Go! Let's go! - To the side. Watch where you're goin'! Look for him, Johnny. Look for him. He's open. Good hustle, Johnny! Come on! Let's go. Coming your way. Hey. What are you doing? You don't even like soccer. I'm here for Donny... Teddy... and Kyle. All right, let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Move the ball! Move the ball! Move it! Move it! Move it! Pass it to Johnny! There it is! There it is! Yes! Yeah! - Yeah! - Whoo! For you. Dude, he totally likes you. Why won't you go out with him? You should. Never said I didn't. I mean, come on, the only guy hotter is, like, your dad. I'm just kidding. Your dad is old. Pick up your man! That's it! Yeah! Pick up the giant! Pick him up! Pick him up! Yeah! He walked in there! Yeah! That's one. That's it? We lost? No, we're going into penalty kicks. Get 'em! All right, let's go. All right, all right, all right. Yes! Chuck! Chuck! Kingston! Kingston! Kingston! Kingston! Yeah! Did Kingston win? No. They have the go-ahead goal. If we don't score, we lose. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, now. Shoot 'em dead, Johnny. Miss it! Come on, Johnny! Wait till you're ready. - You can do anything. - You can do anything. Kingston! Kingston! Kingston! Kingston! Kingston! Hey, is he in there? Last one. Hey. You scored a great goal. Did Dad send you? No. You're not supposed to be in here. Your team's waiting. It was supposed to go in. I put it right there. I blew it. ''You know what, son? ''You win as a team and you lose as a team.'' Yeah, screw Dad. You know what? You're right. You really sucked out there. Yeah, I did. Big time. Come on. Let's go. Love you. Come on, Johnny. Let's roll. A drunk driver. He was pulled from the car. The other boys are banged up. Where's Johnny? Which hospital is he in? Lindsay, Johnny didn't make it. I'm gonna get my purse. Lindsay, Johnny didn't make it. No! Oh, no! No! No! Aah! What color was the car? It's the Walker's car. It's maroon. How fast was it going? I don't know. What if somebody asks something? Tell them the truth, that he died in a car accident. What if they want details? There are no details. He died instantly. He didn't see it coming. And dying doesn't hurt. Was there lots of blood? No. No more questions, okay? Hey, Peter, come on in. Still giving rides to school? Do we have to go? Yes. Everybody goes today... and tonight. You're taking your grandpa, okay? Here, Dad. The most improved junior varsity player... a player who surprised us all this year with 15 assists... Neil Nielson. Come on up here, Neil. Congratulations. Thanks, Mr. C. We're all proud of you, son. I couldn't let this evening pass... without saying a few words about a boy who is not here. A boy who was not only... an extraordinarily gifted athlete... but also the best all-around human being... I've ever had the honor of coaching. Bryan, would you like to come up here and say a few words? Thanks. Um, thanks, Coach. Um, Johnny really loved you guys... and he loved this game. He loved this place. More than anything... he wanted to beat Kingston and make our town proud. Never saw that win. But don't be sad for him. You know what? Just go out there next season... and beat those bastards, all right? You can still do it. It's what he wanted. You can make it happen... for Johnny. I have an announcement. She got her period. I know how to beat Kingston next season. I'm gonna play in Johnny's place. Dad's gonna train me. We have nine months before tryouts. You had to laugh? Grace, sweetie, I'm sorry. You wouldn't have laughed if it was Mike or Danny. Well, they're boys. You said at the banquet... you said, ''Go out there and beat Kingston.'' I didn't mean you. Watch this. Top corner. Good, but not good enough. What are you talking about? That was right in the upper corner. There's no goalie. Nobody blocking you. There's nothing on it. I drilled it. It was a terrible shot. You hit the post. That's crap. It was a meatball. My grandmother could have knocked it down... with her handbag. Peter. Peter, get out here. You're playin'. Come on. I want you one-on-one to the goal. You want to play soccer? Don't go easy on me. There's the ball. Play ball. Wide right. Again. Right now. Play ball. Get around him. Oh. Bryan, that's enough. Again. You're gonna do it. Come on. Show me. Bryan, I said that's enough! Get out of here! Peter, get dry. Get in the house. I'm calling it, Grace. Dad, I can do this! - No. No, you can't. - Yes, I can! You can't even beat him, and he's not on the starting team! Yes, I can! It's this simple. You're not tough enough. They're gonna cream you. It's not gonna happen. Grace. Grace, sweetheart. - Stop. Stop. - No. - Stop it. Daddy. Dad, please help me. No. Not everything's possible. It was for Johnny. It's different for you because you're a girl. It's just a lot harder. You know, my mom used to say that for us girls... life is one big shit sandwich, and we all got to take a bite. Is that what you did? It was a series of personal hardships... and political defeats... that gave him the moral courage to stand up... and face these presidential races. Hey, you know, I want those outlines tomorrow. I have some exams here. Himmelman, Sanchez... Gracie, can I see you a sec? Your exam was totally blank. Should I fail you? Gracie, you're gonna have to step up for the next one. L... I can overlook this one. I gotta get going. Do you want to talk to somebody? The nurse? My mother is the nurse. Gracie, like this. #Don't leave me hanging on the telephone # This way, the smoke won't burn your eyes. Kyle's gonna be captain next year. He tell you? Yeah, he told me when I told him I'd be his girlfriend. Kyle? He's gonna have expectations. I know. I can't miss Bio again. I can. #I like to talk when I can show you my affection # So who gets the room? Daniel, Mike. It's mine! No, it's mine! I'm older! I'm smarter. Yeah, right, dumbo. You're dumbo, too. You're the most dumbo. I knew if I asked you, you'd say no. From Hollywood... - inviting you to join Johnny and his guests George Carlin... Lola Falana, Charles Grant, and... Grace just got into Kyle Rhodes' car. What? I said that Grace just drove off in Kyle Rhodes' car. I can't do it. I can't do it all by myself, Bryan. I need your help. I'm not asking you to. Yes, you are. You're asking me to do it all alone. What do you want me to do? I don't know. I don't know. But we're here. We're still here. You've got three children who are still here. #Born under the wrong sign # #Trouble is my middle name # Wow. Your skin is so soft. So, uh, do you have these freckle things everywhere? Where are you going? Gracie. Gracie, what are you doing? What are you, crazy? Gracie, what are you doing? Your g's backwards. It's a ''j.'' Who for? Johnny. Ah. Yeah, that's... That's really... That's really sweet. Car. Gracie. Kyle, do you really like me? Yeah, yeah. I really do. You think a girl could ever play soccer? That's a good one. Gracie. What is up with you? ...White House window box. I am tough enough. WPLJ music specials feature on Saturday night at ten... oh, my, Paul McCartney and Wings... Sunday night at ten, the Rolling Stones. There you go. I'm Carroll Miller. It's always great music for you right here... with Bruce Springsteen on WPLJ, New York's top album station. #Well, I stood stone-like at midnight # #Suspended in my masquerade # #And I combed my hair till it was just right # #And commanded the night brigade #I was open to pain and crossed by the rain # #And I walked on a crooked crutch # #I strolled all alone through a fallout zone # #And came out with my soul untouched # #I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd # #When they said, ''Sit down,'' I stood up # Hey, Gracie. #Ooh-ooh # I'm not gonna wait forever. #Growin' up # When? #And the flag of piracy flew from my mast # #My sails were set wing to wing # #I had a jukebox graduate for first mate # #She couldn't sail, but she sure could sing # #And I pushed B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues # #With my gear set stubborn on standing # #I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school # #Never once gave thought to landing # The weight room doesn't open till eight. It's for boys only. Are these written policies or just common practice? The girls' gym doesn't have any weights. I can be here early and nobody would even know. I'd know. Is that such a burden? I can't break rules for you. Fine. #But my feet they finally took root in the earth # #But I got me a nice little place in the stars # #And I swear I found the key to the universe # #In the engine of an old parked car # #I hid in the mother breast of the crowd # #When they said, ''Pull down,'' I pulled up # #Ooh-ooh # #Growin' up # #Ooh-ooh # #Growin' up # - Hey. - Hey, yourself. I so dig this music, don't you? I'm burning to ask you something. - What's that? - Don't you ever get a break? Working the door. 'Cause if you did... I was thinking that maybe we could dance. You got an I. D? No. Go on. #Baby, baby, let's get together # #Party hearty # Where did you learn to do that? From you. Kyle's here. You didn't tell me. I didn't know. Liar. #That we like to do # #Aw, do a little dance # #Make a little love, get down tonight # Hey, you showed. #Do a little dance, make a little love # #Get down tonight # #Get down tonight, baby # So are we gonna do this? Let's do this. Just relax. Stop. Hey, you're the one who brought me out here. I mean, look what you're wearing. Stop. Hey. I told you a Bowen can't go all the way. You're way out of your league, sweetheart. You owe me 20 bucks, Curt. Yeah, whatever. Oh, my God. Bryan. Did anyone tell you why we're here? Mr. Bowen? Lindsay. Your daughter Grace, on her last History exam... copied word for word from Jena Walpen's paper. I hated to do it, but I had to fail her. Both girls are on probation. Goal! Goal! Why is Peter here? I think the boys wanted someone to practice with. Oh, yeah! Yes! Oh! Yes! Would you like to go with me on Saturday? I thought we could get you a trim... get the hair off your face. I like my hair. But, honey, nobody can see you. We could go to the mall and get you some new tops. I don't like the clothes they have there. Okay. Anything you want. You choose. Honey, what is going on? I'm just busy. Well, with what? A boy? Kyle? Just things, you know. I don't know. That's why I'm asking. We saw Principal Enright today. Grace, you flunked History. So what, I'm grounded? Uh, sh... well... Uh, I didn't say that. Well, not yet anyway. Well, let me know when you decide on something. What's going on? Do I have to check your homework every night? Good boy. If you're gonna act like a kid, that's how I'll treat you. Show me your homework. - Didn't do it. - Do it now. Can't. Didn't bring my books home. You're grounded. Come straight home from school. And if your grades don't come up, summer school. I want to do something I've never done before. Really? Something you've never done before. I can think of a few things. I want to do 'em all at once, right now. Come on. Go. Come on. You got a license? Yeah. Right here. My mom's. Let's go. Come on. Shh! Shh! Right here. Come on. Bye, boys. #I don't want to know your name # #'Cause you don't look the same # #The way you did before # #Fox on the run # #You scream # #And everybody comes a-running # #Take a run and hide yourself away # Enough sun. Let's go to the club. #Once I had a love, and it was a gas # #Soon turned out # What college you go to? Up in Boston. Oh, cool. Which one? I want to go dance. You want to come dance with me? All right. #Once I had a love, and it was divine # He majors in astrology so he can read girls' hands.

Okay. #In between what I find is pleasing # #And I'm feeling fine # #Love is so confusing # #There's no peace of mind if I fear I'm losing you # #It's just no good you teasing like you do # #Ooh-ooh, oh-oh # #Ooh-ooh, oh-oh # So you're from Beantown? Yeah. Yeah. I've been there a lot actually. I go to college there. Oh, yeah? Which one? BBC. BBC? Mm-hmm. Yeah. How old are you? I'm old enough. Yeah. I don't... I don't think this is a good idea. Let's go back. No. Come on. I have a car. #Ooh-hoo, Jackie Blue # #Making wishes that never come true # #Going places where you've never been # #Ooh, Jackie, you're going again # Come on, baby. - What was that? - Nothing. Gracie. Gracie. - Oh, shit. - Gracie, get out of the car. Who's that? Out, out. Get out. Where's my shirt? Come on, punk. Get packing. Gracie, come on out. Right now. Gracie, you all right? Oh, yeah. She's fine. I owe you one, Sal. You can stop acting like you care. Nobody can see you. You're just lucky you didn't get hurt. Gracie, what the hell were you thinking? Do you really want to have this conversation? I do. Then talk. Come on, Dad. Gracie, get up. Come on. Get dressed. Two feet on the floor. Let's go. Dad. Don't make me get the ice water. Go away. You want to talk? This is me talking. I can't do anything about the weight room. Grace wants to play varsity soccer. That's terrific. Really great, but Columbia doesn't have a girls' team. That's why she's trying out for the boys' team. - No, I'm not. - Grace. You can't play a girl on a boys' team. There's no law against it. There's no law for it. She could get injured. So what? Look. I'm not risking the success of my team for one girl. I've got the team this year to win the whole thing. Well, maybe she can help you do it. Have you seen her play? Coach, we're not asking for any special treatment. Just a tryout. She can either do it or she can't. It's not my call. Take it up with the school board. What the hell was that? You wanted to play, let's petition the board. Like you care. You take summer school in the morning... train with me in the afternoon. Tryouts are in two months, you know. Why now? Where were you when I was begging you? Where have you been my entire freakin' life? Everything's always been about Johnny, about your boys. You don't even care about me because I'm not one of 'em. - Oh, come on, Gracie. - Shut up! Hey, you can't talk to me like that. Listen, you think anybody got better on their own? I coached Johnny. Johnny was a natural. Johnny was a boy! You know, I never had anybody care about me. Nobody ever gave me their damn time. My knee's killing me. Grace, I don't know if you are good enough, but... let me help you. Here. The school board letter. You write this? Yeah. You sign it, too. The sooner we mail it, the sooner they say yes. Those boys are gonna try and take you out. They're gonna go after you. So I'll teach you how to take it, how to give it back. It's mental as much as it is physical. First, we work on speed, toughness... then we work with the ball. You want to do this? Let's go. - Tired? - No. 'Cause if you want to take a break. - No. You? - You seem a little sluggish. I'm just taking it easy on you. Gracie. Dad. Not done. Really fast speed now. Double up. That's it. That's it. Get your knees up. Dad's training her for the boys' team. They're both delusional. Go, go, go, go. Faster feet. Like this. My God, I think I'm gonna puke. So puke. Finish your suicides. You owe me four more. You jerk. Hundred and fifty dollars. You know, your paychecks haven't been going into the account. Have you been cashing them? I quit my job. What? You didn't even talk to me about it? Where have you been going? I just couldn't tell you. Something will turn up. What are we gonna live on? I'm not gonna lose another child. Forty-seven. Forty-eight. Forty-nine. All right. Chin-up. - What? - Let's go. All right, give me ten. Did Johnny do ten? At least. Let's go. One. Two. Check the pot pie in about twenty minutes. Where are you going, Mom? My other job. Ask your father. 'Cause I'm not working... she picked up a couple extra shifts at the hospital. Let's go. Come on. Here's the itinerary. We get to this club... that's having this battle of the bands, right? It's gonna be amazing. You're gonna love it. But, Jena, it is a school night. It's the summer. I have summer session, plus I'm training. People are talking. You're committing social suicide. I don't care. Hold my feet. Gracie, you've always had your athletic interests. But come on... girls who play sports at our age are considered lesbos. I can like boys and sports. I know that, and you know that... but that's not how they see it. They or you? Well, if they think you're a dyke... then I am, too, by association. Well, then, don't associate. Fine. You know what? Maybe you are a lesbo. You were just the last one to know. And that bird's too freaking big for that cage, by the way. Come here. What? I'm gonna toss this little guy. Catch and cradle it. - Don't let it break. - Okay. With your foot. With my foot? Watch. Soft as a pillow. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Here you go. Ready? You try. Oh. Just cradle it. Okay, here. You try. So boys' varsity team... think I can do it? Try out or make the team? The boys are just... Worried about all of them or just one? Kyle's a jerk. If you want to play with boys... you're gonna have to start training with them. #Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak # #Somewhere in this town # #See, me and the boys we don't like it # #So we're getting up and going down # #Hiding low, looking right to left # #If you see us coming, I think it's best to move away # #Do you hear what I say from under my breath? # #Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak # Hey, Gracie. Did you see that, huh? That's how you do it, unless you did. All right, set it up again, boys. Okay. Hey, if you're going, go. Forget Kyle. Gracie's gonna play. - All right. You take it. - All right. Yeah. Curt, step out for a second. Donny, Scott. Craig, step back. No, no, no, no. Let Gracie take it. Yeah. You gotta have some natural talent in there, right? Yeah, come on, Gracie. Show us what you got. She is a Bowen. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, come on. - Yeah, she got you beat, man. - You can, Gracie. Come on, Gracie. - Yeah. - Yeah. There you go. You gotta be quicker, Gracie. Man, that's all right. Ooh hoo hoo hoo! Yeah, yeah. You gotta be good. Hey, Donny. Show her your moves. Boogie-woogie. Boogie. Come on. Come on. Here it is. You comin'? Here it is! Take it, come on. Boo. You want the ball? Go get it. Whoo. Oh, oh, oh. Gracie. What the hell are you doing? It wasn't hard. - You all right? - Gracie, don't go. Is that all she's got? Bye-bye, Gracie. Watch it. I'm ready for my real training. Oh, you think you're ready? With the ball. I don't want to just barely survive out there. I want you to train me like you did Johnny. If you want to compete, Gracie... - Yeah? - You gotta win the ball. You gotta take position. Ready? Get the ball. Go, go, go, go. Peter. Peter. You're not helping anybody. What did he do? He let you get the ball. - All right? - No, he didn't. Don't do that. You get it, all right? Just so much... Be aggressive, tougher. You gotta want and believe that you can take the ball. Go, go, go. Did you hear me? You gotta get your body in front of his. Just like that, all right? Help me out here. You played with Johnny, right? - We goofed around. - You did drills. We didn't really call them that. Gracie. How did you teach Johnny? I didn't. He was a natural, remember? Wow. Is that Johnny? That's me. You guys had the same number? Yeah, number seven, both of us. It's junior year. You saw this before, Grace. Never. That was before I hurt my knee. Oh, oh, wait. Wait. You gotta watch this move. - Ooh. - Whoa. Smoked him. Baff. Right there. - Oh! - Smoked that guy. You were like a star. Well, not so much. Didn't have anybody looking out for me. What about Granddad? What about him? He never saw anything in me. This is what I used to do. Simple move. You just wait for the guy's weight to shift... and then cut the ball. Simple like this. Come on. Come on. Come on. Right? Bam. Baff. I'm gonna try and take it from you. If the angle's not sharp enough, I'm gonna take it. Just look at what I do and do it. No, no, Grace. No. Now, try this. Ready? - Are you paying attention? - Yeah. Good. You gotta get it. Watch this. Like that. Block, and over. Baff. Goal. Come on. You see what I did, right? Come on, Grace. One last time, I'll show you. Ready? Baff. Goal. Kingston, October 23rd. I think it's time to stop. We got a couple more minutes. I think it's too much for her. Too much for her? Does it look like it's too much for her, huh? One, two... three... four... five. Carp, carp, shift. Carp, carp, shift. #Rock steady, baby # Stretch it! Stretch it! Stretch! #Let's call this song # Yeah! Yeah! Goal! Whoo-hoo! #Step n' move your hips with a feelin' # #From side to side # #Sit yourself down in your car # #And take a ride, and while you're movin' # #Rock steady, rock steady, baby # #Let's call this song exactly what it is # #What it is, what it is, what it is # Come on, Grace. Quicker, quicker. #And, Lord, I feel it # #Come dance around # #What it is 'cause I might be doin' # #This funky dance all night, oh # Three, four, five. Three, four, five. One, two, three. One, two... Six... come on... seven, eight. Strike it. Go. Strike it. #Rock # #Steady # #Rock # #Steady # #Rock # #Steady # #Rock # #Steady # Good. Good. You're doin' good, Grace. What? This came today from the school board. Here, Mike. They're not gonna let you play. What? No. No. How could they turn me down? Gracie, you're in great shape, and if you want... Dad talked to Mr. C... and he said you can play field hockey. Field hockey? You never thought I was good enough. You didn't think I could do this, did you? What? You went behind her back? My dad wants me to play field hockey. This is unbelievable. Hey, Peter, you coming? We only got the field for an hour. I gotta go, Grace. Yeah, you better. I get it. You're hoping that Kyle's gonna help you... get a spot on the team, right? And I was just there to help improve your game. Peter, let's go. Shut up. Happy? This isn't you, lying around here... when you could be fighting back. The tryouts are this Saturday. You don't want me to play. Yeah, that's true. I don't. That's not my choice. Do you know what I wanted to be? What? I wanted to be a surgeon. You? Mm-hmm. I wanted to be in the emergency room. So now I'm a nurse. That's as close as I could get. So if you want to limit yourself, that's fine. But don't let other people do it for you. Excuse me. I'm here to see a C. Bowsher. And you are? I really need to see him. Her. I'm Connie Bowsher. Can we talk about this? Couldn't change their mind? I have to file an appeal by tomorrow. - Need help? - From you? Gracie. Gracie, come out. Bowsher just called. The board's gonna hold a hearing for her. Have you told her yet? I'm on my way. Bryan, is she good enough? If they let her play, can she do it? Yeah. Sure. Well, if you don't believe in her... And, finally, Title IX of the federal mandate... requires equal access to sports for girls. Thank you. Coach Connors, tell us what about Title IX? Title IX means there's money for a girls' soccer team... but there's no interest. Why is that? Soccer's not considered a girls' sport. The girls I know would rather watch it than play it. We offer girls' gymnastics... field hockey, badminton, tennis, swimming, softball. Any one of them could use a skilled athlete... like Miss Bowen. Everyone would be afraid to play hard... because they'll be worried about her breaking something... or whining 'cause she's bleeding. She can't run as fast. She can't kick as hard. I don't want to lose 'cause of her. Just because she's Johnny's sister and he died... doesn't mean she should play. I look for speed, ball control, passing ability. All abilities a girl could demonstrate as well as a boy. Never seen it. I'd like to say something. Yes? I'm Lindsay Bowen. I'm Gracie's mother. You have to be on the sheet to speak. There. She's on the sheet. Please, Mrs. Bowen, go ahead. I know that all of you must be asking if you were me... would you let your daughter play on a boys' team? Boys play really rough, and, um, she could get hurt. But I've seen her. I've seen her go out in the cold, in the rain... in the dark. She is fierce. She wants to win. She will not give up because she has a dream. For all of my boys, soccer is and was... the most important thing in their life... and it is the same for Gracie. She loves competing. She loves that win-or-Iose life. L... I don't. It's been Ionely. Gracie's my only daughter... but I would rather miss her than have her miss something... that is so very part of her being. Thank you. The board split. I'm afraid I had to cast the final vote. She gets to play? To try out. Thank you so much. It's up to Coach Colasanti... to decide if you'll make the team. It's up to Gracie. - You got to stretch out. - Yeah, Dad. Yeah. But don't stretch out too fast. I don't want you to cramp up. I got it. There's Johnny. Dad, did you ever wish I was a boy? No. No. Grace, it's different. Just easier with Johnny. I don't know why. Sometimes I just had trouble talking to you. Is that why you coached Johnny? I coach you now. Okay, boys, let's go. Coach is gonna make three cuts today... this morning, after lunch, then tonight. So, uh, don't show him everything in the first hour. Can you hand me that? Just pace yourself. Be a team player. Yeah, like I'm not gonna stick out already. Hey, Johnny once told me about an amazing girl... who hit a bottle off the hood of a car... barefooted from twenty yards out. Hey, Gracie, I know you can do this. Group A: Rhodes, Manley, Jasko, Wicker, Fogel. Group B: Keshawn, Mulstock... Martho, McCarthy, Abbott, Delilo... Alston, Ross, Gracie Bowen. All right, break. Quicker, quicker, quicker. Switch. Come on. Teddy, Teddy, come on. Quicker, quicker. Switch. Call for it. Call for it. There you go. Come on. Quicker, quicker, quicker. Right here. She's not bad. I've seen better. Go. Come on, Teddy. See some fight. Go. Go. See? Come on. Go. Get there, Jerome. Get there. How's she doin'? Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. Who's gonna be first? Let's go. Let's go. Go. Go. Shoot it. Shoot it. Bowen, look at me. When I say ''shoot it,'' damn it, you shoot it. I made it. Only one more cut. What's wrong? You passed 'cause you didn't want to get hit. Yeah, because they were kicking my butt. You got to take it, Gracie. Then you got to give it. You got to show 'em you're no different. What the hell's Mr. C. Thinkin' anyway? He has to make it look real. He'll cut her tonight. Eat. Go on. Eat. No way she finishes tonight. Listen up. I got four yellow shirts here. I want to see who can score a goal. Only two of you make the team. Break. Ready? Give me the ball! Give me the ball! - Oh! - She can take it. Sorry. Bite me. Good work. Come on. Here, here, here, here, here. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Coming left. Coming left. Here. Left. Okay. Okay. You all right? I was wondering the same about your whistle. Feel free to blow it at any time. You wanted to play with the boys. Come on. Come on. Go, go, cross. Pass it. Yes. - Yes! Yes! Yes! - That's my girl! All right. Split into pairs. We'll finish up with headers. Last hour of tryouts. Cutting it a little close, aren't we? Coach C. Said to switch. Work with someone new. I didn't hear him say nothin'. That's 'cause you got your head up your ass. Now, move. All right. Let's go for it. What was that? I saw that, Rhodes! Bowen, you're out. Screw you. - What did you say? - ''Good luck to all of you.'' That's what I thought. Get lost, Bowen, before my hearing comes back. Yeah, yeah. I know. Yes. Gracie. Gracie. I know what you're gonna say. I am good enough. That's why your name's on the board. Yeah? Where? - Junior varsity. - Junior varsity. If you're gonna be the first girl on my team... then you got to be better than good. And you got to act like you deserve to be there. - I do deserve it. - I don't see it. I offered your dad a coaching job. Hey. I'm goin' back. The supervisor put it down as a leave of absence. You hate that place. Yep. And I'm working nights at the warehouse. But after work, you get to coach. I'm glad it all worked out for you. Hey. Sometimes, you just take what you're offered... and make the best of it, you know. Yeah, and eat the shit sandwich. I'm not doin' it. I quit. Johnny was a star... I don't want to hear about Johnny. Johnny's dead. Johnny played more for me than he played for himself. You're different. You truly love this game. That's coaching crap. Quit, why don't you, then? But quit 'cause you're not good enough. Quit 'cause you're never gonna be good enough. Don't quit because you got your feelings hurt... like a little girl! You got to dig deep and go out there... as tough and strong as anyone. I did. No, you didn't. I know what you can do. But it's not enough that I believe in you. You got to make them all believe in you. And how do I do that? You know what to do. Good boy. They practice today? Are you gonna play J. V? Yep. But I won't be back till late. Let's go, let's go. - Down. - G-O. Let's go, let's go. G-O. Let's go, let's go. G-O. Let's go, let's go. Hey, Gracie. Go get 'em. G-O. Let's go, let's go. Down. Up. Kyle didn't even want me on the team, Gracie. He just wanted to hang out so we could talk about you. I loved Johnny, Gracie. He left me, too. Anyway, I already have a new best friend... and I'm gonna stay here with her until she's done. If she decides she wants some food, it's here, too. Heard that's a good book. We drew Kingston for our first game. The whole town's comin' out. I want you there. To play? To support your team. You mean to sit on the bench. The team's wearin' armbands for Johnny. Go on. Go. You can do it. Go. You'll be fine. - Let's go, boys. - Yes, sir! Go, go, go. - Right. - Let's move it up. Yes... We got a game to win. G-O. Let's go. Let's go, boys. Go, go, go! I'm here for the game, Coach. Hey. I got a jersey for you. This was Johnny's. Now it's yours. Switch it. Switch it. Close it up. Close it up. Then move. Come on. Go on. Take him out. There it is. There it is. Oh! Come on, get back on defense! Move it back! Flatten out here. Flatten out. No cross. Move it up. Move it up, boys. Switch it, switch it. Switch the field. Pressure. Get pressure in there. Yeah. That's what we want! That's what we want! I'm on it. I'm on it. I told you to cover the far post. Wicker, go in for Polo. Move it, Wicker. Pick him up. Pick him up, pick him up. Squeeze him, Donny, squeeze him. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick up the side. Whoo-hoo! Did you see that? Did anybody pick him up? No! He just walked in there! Yeah! It's sudden death overtime. Whoever scores wins. I'm not a moron. That's a nice hit. Peter. Peter. Tell Kyle to stay down. Hurry. Ref, I'm makin' a change. Coach, Coach, I'm fine. I can still play. Bowen. Bowen. Get up here. I want you to take the free kick. Can you do it? Okay, get in there. Whatever you do, hit the target. Big freakin' mistake. Colasanti. Sit down. What are you doing? I'm taking the shot. You got to be kidding me. This better be good. Don't blow it. Come on, Gracie. You can do this. Wait till you're ready. You can do anything. I... I can't look. Bowen, what are you doin'? Get your head in the game. You got corner. You better be there. Get back. Get back. Let's get back! Tighten up. I told you to cover the far post. You don't want to do it, you get off the field. Give me the ball. Bowen, what are you doin!? You're playing forward. Give me the ball. Give me the ball. Get rid of it, Bowen. Get rid of it. Oh! Ref, that's a foul. Come on, Bowen. Get off the field. Off the field. Give me the ball. Pass it. I'm open. Pass it. Pass it! Pass it! Finish it. Finish it. Yeah! She did it! She did it! She did it! Yeah! Gracie! Dad! Daddy! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! Gracie! #Well, I stood stone-like at midnight # #Suspended in my masquerade # #And I combed my hair till it was just right # #And commanded the night brigade # #I was open to pain and crossed by the rain # #And I walked on a crooked crutch # #I strolled all alone through a fallout zone # #Came out with my soul untouched # #I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd # #When they said, ''Sit down,'' I stood up # #Ooh # #Growin' up # #The flag of piracy flew from my mast # #My sails were set wing to wing # #I had a jukebox graduate for first mate # #She couldn't sail, but she sure could sing # #And I pushed b-52 and bombed them with the blues # #With my gear set stubborn on standing # #I broke all the rules, strafed my own high school # #Never once gave thought to landing # #I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd # #When they said, ''Come down,'' I threw up # #Ooh # #Growin' up # #Ooh # #Growin' up #
