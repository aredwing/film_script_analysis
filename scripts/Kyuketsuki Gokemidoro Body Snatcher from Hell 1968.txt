Ladies and gentlemen, this plane will pass Oshima and Suzuka and reach Itami Airport at 5:40 p. m. A drink? No thanks. "BRITISH AMBASSADOR ASSASSINATED WITH RIFLE" Mr. Mano, Japan's becoming like America, isn't it? What do you mean by that? Using a rifle to kill people. It's a pity to have lost such a fine man. The Ambassadorwas trying his best to find a way to settle the trouble in Southeast Asia. Tokuyasu, do you really mean what you're saying? What...? Your company exports weapons. Won't you be in trouble if peace comes to Southeast Asia? Isn't that so, Mrs. Tokuyasu? Yes. What are you talking about, Noriko? I'm no match foryou, Mr. Mano. The world's in a terrible shape. Trouble between nations grows worse with terrorism breaking out all overthe place. Everything's gone crazy! You should get yourself a bodyguard, Mr. Mano. You must take care. You can't tell who your enemies are. Nonsense! I'm not afraid to die. A politician who fears his enemies would end up a nervous wreck. Flight JA 307 here. Over. We just received a report that there may be a bomb on the plane. The suspect may try to commit suicide. He wrote to Police HQ saying he would blow up the plane. Return to Haneda Airport at once. I repeat. Return at once! Roger! Check everyone's bags. And quickly! Yes, sir! Ladies and gentlemen. We have to perform a check of your bags. Please have your bags open and ready for inspection. Please. Thank you very much. Why are you checking our bags? The controI tower contacted us. It seems that the bag of a passengertaking the next plane was loaded on here by mistake. What sort of bag? We aren't sure. They didn't tell us. Have you the right to open other people's bags? This is Mr. Mano of the Kenmin Party. It's extremely ill mannered! I don't mind. Go ahead, if you must. But... Thank you. Excuse me, sir. Were there important papers or something in the missing bag? Orwas it a bomb? What? It's the fad nowadays to plant bombs on planes ortrains to blow them up. Isn't that it? There's no bomb! In that case, everything's alright. Is what he said true? No, sir. It's not true? It's a mistake? Yes. Important company papers are in the bag. That's all. Please cooperate with us. Don't talk nonsense! What's so funny about frightening people? I'm a psychiatrist, my friend. I like to study the reaction of people driven to the limit of their endurance. You should get your own head checked out. Please. The suicide of a bird. So it's not just human beings? Do birds lose the will to live? No. It's not that at all. The birds are frightened. I wonderwhy. Something extremely unusuaI is happening. Extremely unusuaI? Birds are sensitive creatures. I can't think that this is a naturaI phenomenon. Thank you. Your bag, sir? I don't have any. What? Mr. Sugisaka. Get me a screwdriver. I'll open it. But if it's a bomb, when you open it, it might... We can't leave it as it is. It's a rifle, not a bomb. Whose is it? Only one man didn't have a bag. It must belong to him! You shouldn't meddle with things. Who told the police about a bomb? Dunno. What'll you do now? What're you doing? Now, you can't contact anyone. Change your course to Okinawa. I refuse! You can't refuse. The lives of the passengers are in my hands. Change your course. A flying object has been sighted. There is every indication that it intends to invade Japan's airspace. The Japanese Defence Force and the US Air Force are in pursuit. A warning has been issued to all planes to avoid its flight path... What's that?

Miss Asakura! Are you okay? We're alive. There may be more survivors. Let's check. Yes. Mr. Tokuyasu. Are you okay? Mrs. NeaI! Mrs. NeaI! Are you hurt? Anything broken? Just stay calm. Mr. Mano! Mr. Mano! Wake up! You're safe. You're okay. Are we the only ones alive? How's yourwife? Um... I haven't checked yet. FooI! Mrs. Tokuyasu! Wake up! Mrs. Tokuyasu! Mrs. Tokuyasu! Mr. Mano! How do you feeI? Are you hurt? Are you hurt? What're you doing out there? Damn. He saw me! It's dangerous outside! Come back at once! It's dangerous! Come back! Come back! Wait for me! Wait! Wait! Watch out! Are you trying to kill yourself? It was you, wasn't it? Where's the bomb? Dunno. You know. Tell me. Where is it? I never had a bomb in the first place. It was just a joke... I lied in my letterto the Police. There's no bomb. Why did you do it? Why? There's no fun in this world. Are we the only ones alive? You! Contact the Haneda ControI Tower at once. I'm afraid I can't. That gunman wrecked the radio. What's that? Where are we, anyway? I don't know. You don't know? We started to return to Haneda, but he forced us to change course. So I've no idea where we are. Listen, I'm a busy man! Do something about it! What're you going to do? Don't you have any bright ideas? We can't waste time. The GeneraI Election is coming up. I understand, but we'll have to wait forthe rescue team. And what are we supposed to do in the meantime? Now look. Are you sure a rescue team will be here by tomorrow? I hope so. That's not good enough! Not one plane has passed over while we've been here. But a rescue party's bound to come. I'm sure of it. I don't believe it. Don't just stand there. You caused the plane to crash. Now find a way out of this mess. It wasn't ourfault. The gauges went wild, that's why we crashed. Faulty gauges? What rubbish! Birds acting strangely... faulty gauges... We saw something. A weird light. A light? It flew right overthe plane. It was blinding. Then the plane crashed afterthat? Yes. Don't try to get out of it. You're responsible forthe crash. It's true! Who's going to believe such fantasies? No, we can't write it off as fantasies. There are things in this universe that mankind does not understand yet. You can't deny that. What planet are you from? What line of work are you in? I'm a researcher in space biology. No wonderyou've got such weird theories. It's hot. Where's the water? That's the only waterwe have. There's nothing else to drink? No, there isn't. You used all the water? I'm crazy! Need water! Stop it! It's all becoming very interesting. As a psychiatrist, I should benefit a great deaI from what happens next. What are you talking about? No water, and nothing to eat. What happens to people in times like this? Everyone wants to live, so we shed our civilised veneer. Then we cease to be human beings. We become beasts! The weak become the victims of the strong -the law of the jungle. In the end, everyone dies. We can't hang around here. Mr. Mano, let's get going. Please wait! It's dangerous outside! Move aside! Wait untiI morning! We're going. You can wait if you want. Mr. Mano, isn't it important forthe nine of us to cooperate? If we keep bickering, we'll ruin our chances of survivaI. Please understand what I'm saying. Shut up and stand aside! Stop it! Move! No! Move, I said! Please understand! Move when I say so! Move! If you're going to shoot, shoot. What are you waiting for? Shoot him! If you don't, he'll kill us! Give me the gun! Drop the gun! What are you? "BRITISH AMBASSADOR ASSASSINATED WITH RIFLE" Then you killed the Ambassador? Who paid you to do it? I don't know anything about it! What's that? Miss Asakura! Miss Asakura! Miss Asakura! Miss Asakura! Miss Asakura! What happened? I'm afraid! What did you see? Miss Asakura! What do you want? Mr. Mano, you must be tired. I found some whisky. You have it. Mr. Tokuyasu, we're digging graves forthe dead. Why not dig your own grave too? Gasoline! It's dangerous! Where was she? Where did he go? Isn't that his rifle? I found it on a ledge but he wasn't around. He wouldn't run away leaving a hostage and his gun. Could he have fallen off the cliff? Tell me, what happened to him? Where is he? Tell us! Where is he? What're you doing? ...next the news. The jetlinerthat vanished today has still not been found. Rescue planes found no traces of the missing plane. It is feared that there may be no survivors of this strange incident. When we have any further news, we'll broadcast it without delay... The fooI! How dare he say we're all dead! Damn it! Okay. The rescue party isn't coming. We can't stay here. Let's go. There's a murderer outside. He's hungry for blood. What'll we do then? In orderto save ourselves, we must first find out what's become of him. We don't even know where he is. She's so frightened she can't speak. There's nothing we can do. Make hertalk. Make hertalk? How? Go to sleep. Into a deep sleep. Deeper. Just relax. Keep looking into the flame. You're so tired and the flame brings you sleep. You're sleeping deeply now. Just rememberwhat you saw. Tell me what you saw. So, try to rememberwhat happened. You saw something which frightened you. Tell me everything about this terrifying thing. What was it? You're remembering? So, tell me. Will you? What happened to that man? Now, open your eyes. You can answer my questions. Try to rememberwhat happened to the man who took you off the plane. What did you see out there? It shines! It's blinding! It shines. What is it? The light makes a noise? And then what? It went out. Where? Where did it go out? It shines! It's blinding! I know that. What happened afterthat? Did the man go into the light? You saw something. What did you see? What happened when he went into the light? I'm afraid! You saw it? Now, tell me. Tell me. What is it that you are so afraid of? Wound! Was he wounded? Inside the wound! Miss Asakura! Is that true? It's a lie! I don't believe it. She's Iying! That's right. It must be a lie! I don't want to believe it, but it's true. What blinding light? Impossible! No, it's possible. The light she saw... I imagine it could have been a flying saucer. Flying saucer? I see. So that's what that light was. The same thing that caused our crash. Nonsense! Flying saucers don't exist. There's no evidence forthem. You're wrong. What? What you say is a mistake. People have seen flying saucers in many parts of the world. We can't deny it. So what? Since the A-bomb was dropped in Hiroshima, there has been an increase in the number of flying saucers. It seems that while man destroys, slaughtering his fellow man in senseless wars, space creatures plan to invade. What's she saying? She says war's absolutely unacceptable. Her husband, who's been fighting in Vietnam, died a week ago. She was on herway to the US base in Iwakuni for her husband's remains. What're you doing? Why'd you have to go and do that? To find out what happened. Shut up! We were better off not knowing! You shouldn't... It's too late to say that now. You all agreed to it, didn't you? Tell me. What she said was all lies, wasn't it? It's the truth! AII lies! They have to be! Tell me they're lies! What she said is true. It's the truth. What? You scum! What're you doing? You pushed him off, didn't you? No! I didn't do it! Liar! Let's lock the murderer up! No! I didn't do it! Listen to me! Open the door! I didn't do anything! I didn't do it! Let me out of here! Open the door! Let me out! I can't stand it I here! I'll go mad! What's all that noise? Something really frightened you? Something happened to me? Yes. You had a nightmare. Forget all about it. Don't let it get you down. Be strong. We're going to live no matterwhat happens. Is it morning yet? Water! Isn't there a drop of water? Mr. Mano. You're not the only one who wants water. Please hold out untiI morning. Stop it! Whisky will only burn yourthroat. Is it the wind? No, it's not the wind. It may be Mr. Momotake. He can't be alive. Don't open it. Mr. Momotake! Mr. Momotake, is that you? What's she saying? She says she can't let him lie there. What? His wound reminds her of how her husband died. A napalm bomb ripped open her husband's face. Sugisaka, are you out of your mind? Please move aside. There's no telling what he'll do if we let him in! Look. He came back to ask for help. And he doesn't have a gun, now. He's wounded. Saga. Please help me. He's dead. A deep wound like that, and yet no blood. What's the reason? I've got a bad feeling. Find anything out? No. Something inconceivable is about to happen. Birds killing themselves, that strange light, flying saucers and now that gaping wound on his face. Something we can't imagine is in controI. Stop pretending to be a prophet! Water's more important! Give me water! Mr. Mano. There's still a drop of whisky left. What? That's what you get for drinking too much whisky. Tokuyasu! You knew drinking whisky would only make you thirstier, didn't you? Well, you'lljust have to bear it. You offered Mr. Mano whisky on purpose? You wanted to enjoy seeing him suffer, didn't you? Bastard! Stop it! If we keep on quarrelling like this, we'll never get out of here. Somebody, get me some water! Before I die! Tokuyasu, get me some water, and I'll seriously think about giving you that government contract. Seriously? Then you weren't really considering giving it to us before? I see. I thought as much. I wanted to know what you really thought. That's why I offered you the whisky. You rat! The only reason you approached our company in the first place was to get us to give you money. Tokuyasu, this is no place to say such things! I don't give a damn who hears it. You've accepted nearly one billion yen from my company! I gave you plenty in return! Your company was going bankrupt. Now it's one of the richest in Japan. Who do you have to thank forthat? Don't make it sound like you did us a favour. You owed us much more than that! Tokuyasu. You'd be nothing without me! Tokuyasu! Give it to me! Please! Give me that water! Please! Mr. Tokuyasu, give him the water. Please! Don't be so crueI, give it. Do you want this, Mr. Mano? If you want it, you'll tell everyone the reason you were going to Osaka. But that's... I approached you to make money. I even threw in my wife as a treat. Now tell them your half of the deaI. Come on, speak! You tricked me and now you'll pay. Stop it! Don't do that! Now, Mr. Mano. Tell them. Now. Say it nice and loud. Stay where you are! I'll say it then. You were coming with me to Osaka to receive thirty million yen from my company. That's the truth! And in return you were to pressure the government so they would buy all theirweapons from my company. It was all a pack of lies. You had no intention of keeping yourword to us. Wouldn't the voters laugh if they saw you now? Tokuyasu! When we get out of here, you're through! I'll see that you're ruined for life! You see if I don't! Mr. Tokuyasu, don't be foolish! Don't move! Outside! Don't be foolish! Shut up! Go! Get out! Out! Okay. You too! Get out! Stay back! What're you going to do? Stop it! Stop it, I say! Tokuyasu! Tokuyasu! Don't look. Please go back to the cabin. The blood's gone. It's all been drained from his body. What? Mrs. Tokuyasu. It's his punishment. He sold his own wife, just to get ahead in business. He deserved to die like that. You despise me, don't you? No, that's no true. I don't care what anyone thinks. After all these years, I've escaped from his grip forever. I'm free at long last. Now I can do whatever I want. It's hot, isn't it? Shouldn't it be dawn soon? He caused me such pain. He shouldn't have had to die in this terrible way. Saga. Saga, you know what caused this. Please tell us. No, I don't. I have no idea. You do. You're keeping something from us. Just a guess. Only conjecture. I'll most likely be proved wrong. If I say what I think, it'll only upset everyone for no reason. I see. I still want to know. Why was he killed in that way? To be drained of blood. Tell me why! Noriko! Mrs. Tokuyasu! Noriko!! Mrs. Tokuyasu! Noriko! Mr. Mano, did you find her? No. Let's search overthere. Hey, Noriko! Noriko! Noriko! Noriko! Noriko! Noriko! Wait there. Earth people. You cannot understand us so we are talking through her. We are the Gokemidoro people. We live in a universe farfrom Earth. We've marked Earth for a long time and we have now raided it. Our plan is to wipe out all of mankind. The end has come and mankind is on the verge of destruction. It is your own fault that we have chosen you for annihilation. You have already turned yourworld into a monstrous battlefield. Noriko! Noriko! How terrible. She was brainwashed. Nonsense! The aliens brainwashed her to convey theirwill to us. That's enough! You're lucky to be so blind. You saw that terrible thing happen, and you still don't believe it. Saga. Don't hide the truth. Tell us. Explain what happened to Noriko. I believe in the existence of aliens. You think there are such things? There are theories about these creatures. They possess a high intellectuaI standard, that much we know. They're also scientifically advanced. Or else they'd never have crafts capable if interplanetary flight. They've been seen in many parts of the world. I think they've been gathering in preparation fortheir attack. Now they've chosen the moment and begun their attack. That's absurd! Even with proof, mankind refuses to believe in them. They preferto ignore this threat from alien invaders. Instead, they fight each other. The space men must be pleased. We've made it easy forthem. These creatures know that their best chance is when men are preoccupied with killing each other. Mankind doesn't stop to think before it takes action. He was right. The Gokemidoro said we'd be destroyed. But we don't need any outside help to bring it about. What rot! Talk some sense! Mano! You saw what happened out there. Death caused by a vampire. Aliens have taken over his mind. And yet you still don't believe it. Listen. Intellectuals always try to mislead people by talking loads of rubbish. Mr. Mano. How can we make you understand? I'll believe it when I see a vampire with my own two eyes. But even then... I'd like to see one suck blood too. Eh? I'll never get a chance like this again. As a scientist, it would be invaluable. I must see it. Well, that's interesting. Let's experiment and see. How can we? There's an easy way. Pick a victim. That's crazy! One will die to save the rest. Human sacrifice has gone on for centuries. I agree with Mr. Mano. I want to see it. Sacrificing human lives? Have you both gone mad? Science and governments make progress at the cost of many lives. That's a fact that can't be denied. Mr. Saga! Tell Mrs. NeaI that she can join her late husband. No! I won't let you murder her. She's a foreigner. No trouble later. I won't tell her. Mr. Mano, you call yourself a human being? Then you be the victim. Water! Please! Please. Give me water! We'll throw him out. Get away, watch out! Mrs. NeaI! Mrs. NeaI! Get in the cockpit. Hurry! Get in. Get in! Sugisaka! What're you doing? Hey! Let me go! Don't leave me! I can't believe it. I can't believe in anything any more. Sugisaka. Mrs. NeaI is afraid. I know that. Still, there are limits to what a person should do. Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! The bomb! So. The bomb's been there all the time. Open up! If you don't, I'll blow up the plane! Stay away! Stay away! Stay away! Watch out! My legs! My legs are hurt! Saga! We can't waste any more time. Let's get going! What about Mr. Saga? We'd better leave him behind. What? Let's get out of here. Please stay. My friend. Don't worry. I won't leave you here. Thank you. You go. I'll make a stretcher. We'll follow you. You're fools! Mano! Hurry! Ah! It's him! Well now, we can leave pretty soon. I'm sorry to be a burden to you. It serves me right. I did the worst thing a human being could do. No wonder I was punished for it. You go on. I'll only slow you down. What are you saying? We're not going to let those creatures get you. You know, I'd lost all faith in my fellow man. But by being with you two, I feeI there's still some hope left for humanity. Listen. Don't lose hope. Otherwise life would be unbearable. Yes, that's true. We must believe in each other. Help me, please! Please help me! Someone, help! Help me! Mano! What're you doing? Mr. Mano! Mr. Mano! Mr. Mano! Mr. Mano! What kind of a beast are you? Miss Asakura, run! Miss Asakura! Mr. Sugisaka! So he's dead now. I'm safe at last. If we stay here, I'll be too late forthe generaI election. Let's go. Hey. Say something. What are you mad about? What's bothering you, anyhow? You're not going to tell everyone when we get back are you? I suppose you think that you can ruin my entire politicaI career. Now see here. This was an abnormaI situation. It's only naturaI we act strangely. You were no different to anyone else. Do you really think that you'd be able to finish my politicaI career? Who would believe anything that you have to say? Hey. For god's sake speak up! Say something! Say something! What're you doing? Let him go. Hands off! Hurry, run! Mr. Mano! Run! I don't want to die! Let me live! He's after us! Run! Watch out! Mr. Sugisaka! Mr. Sugisaka! Run! Go on alone! Mr. Sugisaka! We're safe, aren't we? Let's go. Mr. Sugisaka! I can't make it. You must live. Live no matterwhat happens. They're dead. What's happened? Hey. Excuse me. Listen now. We are the Gokemidori from a distant planet. So beware. We are going to destroy your entire world. You are through. You have arrived at your finaI day of judgement. Meet your doom, for not one of you shall survive. It is too late to wish you had lived differently. Why did this have to happen? It's too late. Mankind is through. It's too late to repent. THE END
