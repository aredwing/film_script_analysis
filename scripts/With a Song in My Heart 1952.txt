Tonight's is no exception to that rule. % % [Piano] % % [Fanfare] And now, ladies and gentlemen, the highlight of the evening. For those of us in show business or newspapers... or who are just plain, ordinary music listeners... this is an occasion of special significance and pride. For among those who are being honored here tonight... is a very wonderful singer and a very great lady... who has been named the most courageous entertainer of the year.

But why the most courageous entertainer of the year? Well, let's see. Suppose we start here... at a radio station in Cincinnati... on a bright summer's morning a few years back... when suddenly there exploded from a taxicab... the figure of a young lady. Then, as always, in a terrible hurry. Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. - L... I just wasn't looking. - Hmm. - Forgive me, please. - It's all right. % % [Men Singing, Faint] % And we're having trouble% % Sure as you're born% % Trying to find someone% % To hoe that corn% % Hoe that corn 'cause it's gotta grow% % Can't you see that the liquor's low% % Gotta have a jug to make us go% % Who'll hoe that corn% % Rube took Fanny to the fair today% % They rode in on a load of hay% % Don't expect 'em back till the end of May% - % Who'll hoe that corn% - % Zeb had 10 daughters but no son% % Got 'em all married one by one% % 'Cause he's pretty handy with that old shotgun% % Who we got to hoe that corn% % Little Elsie's just turned 10% % Kinda peculiar Don't like men% % Keeps pretendin' she's a hen% - % Who'll hoe that corn% - [Blowing] % Hoe, hoe that corn% % Hoe, hoe, hoe hoe that corn% % Hoe, hoe that corn% % Everybody's gotta hoe that corn% - [Blowing] - % Who'll hoe that corn, a rippy-tippy% - % Who'll hoe that corn% - % Hot city papa, won't you play that jazz% % Who'll hoe that% % Corn% % Okay, boys, write your names out and leave 'em with my secretary. If anything comes up, she'll let you know. - Wait a minute. Did you like it or didn't you? - Very nice. Then how 'bout giving us an answer now? After all, we're pretty busy too. Really? Where are you working? We just finished eight weeks at the Palmer House in Chicago. Before that, London, New York. You name the spot, we were there. Sorry, boys. Looks like you're out of our class. I don't think you'd be interested in anything we'd have to offer. Besides, this is radio, you know, not vaudeville. - [Door Closes] - What a jerk. Sure, he's a jerk. They all are. But that don't mean you gotta divulge the secret. Besides, did it ever occur to you that maybe we weren't so hot either? - Listen, Harry... - This song of yours, it ain't no Berlin, brother. Anytime you're not happy with the way things are going, do me a favor. - Just say so. - Nobody said anything about not being happy. But a guy's got a right to wonder where all this is gettin' us. By "all this," you wouldn't mean me and my big mouth, would you? That sure don't help any. In that case, maybe we'd be doing each other a favor if we just called it quits. Well, I'm not suggesting it, but it's an idea. Then consider it done. Okay, pal. See ya around. Excuse me. Are they through in there? Utterly and emphatically! Thank you. Good morning. I'm Jane Froman. I'm sorry I'm late for my audition, but there was a terrible traffic jam. Paul Whiteman spoke to you about me, remember? - Paul Whiteman? - Yes. I have his card here somewhere. He heard me sing at the conservatory. You're studying at the conservatory? Yes, I'm in my second year studying voice harmony and theory. Here it is. He wrote something on the back. Mmm. Pops apparently thinks you're pretty good. I dictated it, but he wrote it. He did ask me to go with his band. But I told him I didn't want to be known only as a band singer. I'd rather be on the air. You can understand that, can't you? Oh, perfectly. And what experience have you had? Well, I've sung once with the Cincinnati Symphony. And last month I sang at one of Mrs. Taft's teas. Mrs. Robert Taft's teas? Mm-hmm. Before that, I had a week's engagement at the Grand Central Theater in St. Louis. I was billed as the "Blues Singing Coed from Missouri U." You don't say. Well, you've had quite a career. - What do you want to sing now? - I brought several things along with me. Let's see. Do you know this one? Well, I think I can handle it in my own humble way. - % % [Picks Up Tempo] - % I saw you last night% % And got that old feeling% % When you came inside% % I got that old feeling% - % The moment you... % - Pardon me. Pardon me. May I ask what all this is about? I understood you were looking for a hot singer. May I give you some advice, Miss Froman? - Well, certainly, if it's good advice. - Okay. You're a very nice-looking young lady. I thoroughly approve of both your face and contour. For all I know, you may even have a good voice. - Shall I go on? - Please do. All right, then listen. Having a good voice is a big help. Let's call that God's contribution. But in show business, you've got to have a lot more than just a pair of pipes. You've got to know how to walk, how to smile, how to take a bow. But most of all, what to do with your hands. Look, you're singing a song, not waving to a bunch of immigrants at Ellis Island. I'm sorry. May I try it again? Only if you'll sing it right... and not the way you think somebody else might like it, okay? Okay. From the heart. % I saw you last night% % And got that old feeling% % When you came in sight% % I got that old feeling% % The moment you danced by% % I felt a thrill% % And when you caught my eye% % My heart stood still% % Once again I seemed to feel% % That old yearning% % And I knew... % Come in. This is Miss Froman, one of Paul Whiteman's protgs. - She mistook me for you. So I'm auditioning her. - So I see. - You're not the director? - Uh-uh, he is. - Show him your card. - That won't be necessary. I'm on my way to lunch. It'll only take a minute. Read it. Read what it says on the other side. Hmm, but your appointment was for 11:00. Some other time, perhaps. Why not now? I'll play for her. Get over there. Go on, where you can see her.

I think we can find a spot for you. Doing commercials. Ten dollars a program. - Ten dollars? - Later, maybe we can take you on as a staff artist. What does being a staff artist mean? It means they can use you on as many shows as they like day or night, and will. - If you don't want it, just say so. Yes or no? - But I do want it very much. Very well. Be in my office tomorrow at 10:00. - We'll start you out on Jim's Toasty Peanuts. - Oh, brother. By the way, I seem to have forgotten your name... but this piano is for studio use only. Our studio, not yours. In the future, please remember that. - Yes, sir. - Good-bye, Miss Froman. Good-bye. - [Door Closes] - And they wonder what's wrong with radio. Joe Jerk. He doesn't know a good voice when he hears it. - Do you? - I know you've got a voice. - Incidentally, my name's Ross. Don Ross. - How do you do, Mr. Ross? - I hope you're not sore at me. - Why should I be? Well, after all, I almost lost your job for you, didn't I? Yes. But then, of course, you're right, he's wrong. - How's that again, ma'am? - Mr. Ross, give me credit for having a little sense. Besides, now that I've got the job, I'll do it my way. Excuse me. Your way. May I ask you just one more question, Miss Froman? - As many as you'd like. - Just one. How'd you like some lunch? - Frankly, I'd love it. - Okay, come on. I'll buy you a peanut butter sandwich. I might even make it Jims Toasty kind. - After all, you gotta plug the product. - [Laughs] [Chimes] - % Oh, nibble a bite, nibble a bite% - % Jim's Toasty Peanuts% - % Nickel a bag, nickel a bag% - % Jim's Toasty Peanuts% % Crispy, crunchy, toasty munchy, tasty and nutritious% % Jim's ever-loving Toasty Peanuts% % Delicious% % [Don Narrating] Staff artist.

The first outside offer that made any sense... came from one of those great big movie palaces... on State Street with 3,000 seats... just itching to be filled each week. I gave her arm a little twist, and she took it. Got top billing too... right up there with the latest hit from Hollywood. Incidentally, if you'll forgive me for pointing... I was also on the bill that week... and strictly not by coincidence. Leave us not emphasize that point however. This was Jane's big chance. % % [Drumroll] % Hallelujah% % Hallelujah% % All you sinners% % Gather round% % Hallelujah% % Hallelujah% % All you sinners% % I have found% % A land where the weary forever are free% % Come you sinners and just% % Follow me% % Forget your troubles and just get happy% % You want to shoo all your blues away% % Shout hallelujah Come on, get happy% % Get ready for the Judgment Day% % The sun is shinin' Come on, get happy% % The Lord is waitin' to take your hand% % Shout hallelujah Come on, get happy% % We're goin' to the promised land% % We're headin' for the river% % Wash your sins 'way in the tide% % It's all so peaceful% % On the other side% % Forget your troubles and just get happy% % You want to shoo all your blues away% % Shout hallelujah Come on, get happy% % Climb higher% % And higher% % You gotta keep away from Satan% % And his fire% % We're headin'% % For the river% % Wash your sins 'way% % In the tide% % It's all so peaceful% % On the other side% % Forget your troubles and just get happy% % You want to shoo all your blues away% % Shout hallelujah Come on, get happy% % Get ready% % For the Judgment Day% % [Applause] - Great, baby. Great. - Don, just before I went on... the manager sent word they want to hold me for another week, maybe longer. - Yeah, how much? - Same as this week, I suppose. Isn't that wonderful? Sure, bighearted him. [Applause Continues] % % [Orchestra] - All right, Miss Froman, if I could see you now. - Certainly. I'll be right back. - Hey, wait a minute. I'm in on this. - In what way? - I'm her manager. - Since when? Well, now, you know, I never could remember dates. She didn't say anything to me about a manager. I'll bet she didn't say anything to you about a birthmark either, but she's got one. - Right, Jane? - Right. Okay, let's go. Okay, Ross, you win. - A thousand a week, but on one condition. - For you, anything. That you get out of this theater, and stay out. You're canceled as of now. Is that clear? For 750 a week, I'd have argued. At a thousand bucks, your slightest wish is law. Here, honey, you have to sign too. - Good night. - Good night, Herman. Don, you were fantastic. A thousand a week, it's a fortune. Now I can even pay the installments on this coat. Did you see that baby's face? I thought he was gonna explode. Which, come to think of it, might have been quite an interesting sight. - I feel terrible about you losing your job. - What job? A stooge on a bill with a dog act and a bunch of dumb acrobats. Which reminds me, where would you like to eat? Don't ask me. I'm a stranger in town. But I'm feeling mighty rich. - Let's go somewhere we can't afford. - Spoken like a leading lady. Taxi. Taxi! Of course, if you'd take my advice and get married... you wouldn't have to worry about where you're gonna eat. We could just go home and eat. - Please, let's not go into that again, not tonight. - I'm sorry. I forgot. - When you were five, your father tipped his hat and rolled away... - Don, it's nothing to joke about. Taxi. Taxi! So one marriage goes on the rocks. Does that mean they all have to? - I've seen too much of the other side of it. - Okay, okay. Consider it unsaid, like a letter that didn't get sent. But I can't forget it either. You've been so wonderful to me, all your help... Tell you what you do. Send me a Christmas card signed "Gratefully yours." Hey, taxi. Taxi! You're so rich you can't even get a taxicab. Come on. Let's walk up an appetite. [Don Narrating] She had Chicago eating right out of her hand. But if you're in show business, there's only one town. New York, they call it. Baghdad-on-the-Hudson. % % [Orchestra] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Tony Morello and his orchestra... coming to you from Radio City in New York.

In the words of the, shall we say, more conservative critics... "a zooming wow, '" "a hot canary, '" "the tops. '" Offers poured in from everywhere... from big-name movie houses... top air shows like Palmolive, Coca-Cola, Buick. You didn't need a crystal ball to tell where all this was leading... right straight to her selection as the number one girl singer on the air. Meanwhile, what about me? Well, I'll bite. What about me? Oh, I managed a few jobs here and there. Hittin' the Follies in which Jane was a star. The Pontiac program. A trip to Hollywood for a movie test. In fact, I was just back from that. But my real job... my 24-hour-a-day job... was increasingly Jane. [Jane] Yes? Who is it? [Raspy Voice] Lady, I'm workin' my way through barber college. I just wondered... Don! I thought you were still in California. - We all make mistakes. How are you, baby? - I am fine. Come on in. - Miss me? - Like a front tooth. - You don't show it. - You dog. Just because I've put on four pounds. - Where? - Where do you think? I played 18 holes of golf yesterday and rehearsed four hours trying to get it off. What about you? What about the picture? If those birds think I'm gonna stay in Hollywood just to play a stooge for Victor Mature... - Eighteen holes, huh? What'd you shoot? - Never mind that. I was so in hopes this would be the break you'd been waiting for. You couldn't give me Hollywood. Besides, if I'm out there, who's gonna run out and get you a jar of cold cream? Suppose it wasn't as good a part as you'd hoped for. It's not always the size of the part that matters. Maybe if you'd talked to them, they'd have built it up. Look, what's the use of kidding ourselves? There wasn't any picture deal. Just another wild-goose chase that some screwball agent dreamed up. But who cares? The Chief gives you a nice ride. I slept like a Monday night audience both ways. And now you. What have you been up to, besides golf? - Nothing of any interest. - Is that so? Then what's all this I read in Winchell's column about you and that Long Island polo player? Oh, him? He's all right. He's fun. Not a brain in his head. Mm-hmm. And all these flowers? From some garden club, no doubt? Or do you send them to yourself? - Mind if I take a peek? - I'm not sure I should let you. But go right ahead. Help yourself. Who's this one? Oh, just somebody who's down to his last million or two. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Reduced to that, eh? So much for him. Now, you were saying? I wasn't saying anything. But there was something you said about getting me a jar of cold cream when I need it. Oh, that's just a way of talking. Mind if I fix myself a drink? Of course not. I'll fix it for you. What'll it be? - Scotch. - And soda? A little. You know, it's true. I have let you do things for me. I'm the slave type. I like doing them. - Listen, you wanna know something? - Mm-hmm. I haven't got a polo pony to my name. I haven't even got a million bucks. - Imagine. - But you know how I feel. The question is, how do you feel? All kidding aside, don't you think it's time we talked things over... got something settled? I don't know what to say, Don. You've been so wonderful to me. You've taught me so much. - But you're not in love with me, is that it? - I didn't say that. It's just that, well, I'm not sure. You see, I've never been in love before. And you sort of expected someone to come along, like a knight on horseback? I suppose every girl looks forward to a little fireworks. You haven't been reading True Confessions, have you? It's possible. It's also possible that I'm in love with you. Okay. That's good enough for me. Let's say you are. How about dropping down to city hall with me some morning? They tell me there's been quite a run on marriages lately. Maybe it's the war fever. People hedging against the future. Anyway, something's doing it. - Do you really want me to do that, Don? - Of course I do. What do you think I've been driving at all these months? I've asked you so many times, I'm beginning to sound like a roundelay. Suppose I put it another way, for a change. I'm a poor little sheep who's lost his way. And you, baby, you're big business. I need you. You need me. The perfect setup for matrimonial bliss. Also, think how economical it would be if we ever went on tour. Two for the price of one. You're not still stewing about your mother and what happened to her marriage? No, it's not that. It's... It's just that I want to be sure. Maybe this is a silly thing to say, but I want a home, Don... a real home. What do you call this... a shanty in old shantytown? - I don't mean just a house. - Look. If it'll relieve your mind, I give you my word... that as cook, dishwasher, lover boy, I'll be strictly Phi Beta Kappa. What more could you wish for than that? I can't think of a single thing, Mr. Ross. Then the answer is... yes? [Don Narrating] I wouldn't say it was the most elaborate ceremony of the year... but as weddings go, it was all you could ask for... - words, music... - % % [Organ Hits Wrong Note] Did I say "music'"? Witnesses, kisses, even a shower of rice. Yep, we were married and lived happily ever... Well, at least we were married. The orange blossoms came later when we drove out to California for our honeymoon.

Because it's no good, that's why. Oh, you're crazy. It is good. It's wonderful. I told you that when you first started it. Listen, don't kid me. I'm the guy that wrote it, and I tell you it's no good. - It'll never be any good! - Now, don't be silly. Come back here and play it. Will you stop trying to give me that old build-up stuff. And for heaven's sake, stop feeling sorry for me. Nobody's feeling sorry for you. I'm just trying to get you to stop feeling sorry for yourself. Now, come on. Stop acting like a two-year-old and play it. Why is it you can sell me, sell everybody, but not yourself?

But not my song... you. Oh, for heaven sakes. Of course they applauded your song. You could sing a nursery rhyme and they'd applaud. Now I'm really cooked. - But, Don... - I can just hear 'em now. "What's Froman trying to do, make a songwriter out of her husband? Can't he find anybody else to sing his tripe?" I'm sorry. I was only trying to help. Sure, you were trying to help, but don't you see what you're really doing is killing me. [Knocking] - Yes? Thank you. - Thank you, Joe. Yes, Miss Froman. Look, Don. If you really feel that way about it... why don't you stop trying to write songs? Try something else for a while. Nobody could write anything good feeling the way you do. I thought it would get around to that. Maybe I should get out of show business. - I didn't mean that. You know I didn't. - Okay, what did you mean? You should stop worrying about me and what I do for a while and think about your own career. What career... vaudeville that doesn't exist anymore? There are plenty of jobs a man with your experience can do. I suppose you call managing you nothing. Of course it's something. It's terribly important. - But if it's going to make you unhappy and jealous... - Jealous? Well, that's a new one. You seem to have forgotten... that the first time I saw you you didn't even know how to take a bow. But, brother, you learned that one fast enough. What's the use? It always ends up in the same old argument. As you say, what's the use? Don. I know it isn't easy for you. It isn't easy for any man being married to a woman in the spotlight. - Why don't I give it up? - [Closes Door] - Are you crazy? - If it's going to spoil our marriage, it isn't worth it. Not to me anyhow. We don't need a lot of money and a big house. Let's start all over again. Concentrate on you for a change. No, thanks. Nobody's gonna make that kind of a sacrifice for me. Good night. - Where are you going? - Out. - Aren't you gonna take me home? - Maybe, maybe not. Who can tell? % % [Jane Singing Over Radio] - Double bourbon. - Yes, sir. [Laughing] Well, well. - Hello, Harry. - How are ya, boy? - Sit down. You need a drink. - You said it. - Fill her up, Clarence. - Yes, sir. - Some voice, huh? - The best. Listen. Answer me just one question, will ya? But first, I wanna get this outta the way. I don't mind taking a sock on the nose... but I don't want anybody crowning me with one of these. What I wanna know is... Now I'm not saying you're not a good Joe and an eager beaver... but honestly now, romantically speaking... what did a dame like Jane Froman ever see in you? Lay off, will you? You're drunk. Sure I'm drunk. Tomorrow I'm gonna hate myself. But tonight I still want to know why a dame... that's on top of the world ever married a guy like you. - Answer me that. - Did it ever occur to you that she might be in love with me? Well, now that you ask me, frankly, no. - Beat it, will you? - Oh, now... - Beat it! - No hard feelings, pal. I just like to know these things. Well, see ya around. % % [Singing Continues] - Fill it up. - Okay, sir. [Don Narrating]Jane and I patched that one up, of course. We always did. But something had happened to us... to our marriage. Things had been said that neither of us would ever forget. And now it was Sunday. I'd had to go out of town for the weekend. It was the maid's day off, and Jane was in the house alone. With the temperature hovering just above zero... naturally, the furnace wasn't going to let an opportunity like that slip by. It didn't. [Man]... the Associated Press reports the attack began shortly after dawn, Honolulu time... and continued for approximately two hours. A bulletin just handed to me says the president has called... a special cabinet meeting for 8:30 this evening... and is preparing a message to Congress... presumably asking for a formal declaration of war. I should think so. But to get back to the A.P. Dispatch... indications are that more than 40 Japanese bombers... with the red circle of the rising sun clearly visible on their wings... suddenly appeared escorted by swarms of fighters. Flying high, they suddenly dive-bombed seeking to destroy our entire Pacific Fleet... including aircraft carriers anchored in Pearl Harbor. [Man #2] Although no actual figures have been released... it is believed that the damage to the Fleet has been very great... and that the loss of life is staggering. Say, Don, where the devil is Froman? She's on in 12 minutes. - Relax, relax. She'll be here. - Something must have happened. She's never been late. Nothing's happened. She had to play a camp show over in Jersey. Probably had trouble getting away. I had a motorcycle escort waiting for her. She'll be here. - See, what'd I tell you? - How much time have I got? - If you hurry, you've got... - I'll make it. I'm all ready except for my dress. - The makeup's still good. - Oh, what a life. - How'd it go? - Wonderful. Only I made the mistake of doing that Claudette Colbert routine. It Happened One Night. Where I lift my skirt and pretend I'm thumbing a ride. Pretty low trick, but those gobs ate it up. Art lovers to the last man, no doubt. By the way, I got a present for you. Two of' em, in fact. - What? - From a fan of yours in Syracuse. She brought it herself. All breathless and dewy-eyed. Oh, pretty. She said to be sure to wear it for luck. That was very sweet of her. Did you thank her? With accompanying gestures all the way to the door. Put it there for me by my bag, will you? What's the other present? - Here you are. - Seasick pills? Uh-huh. They called from U.S.O. Headquarters. They want you to be ready to leave for London on 24-hours' notice. They do? Lucky for me I got my shots today. [Man Narrating] It was at this precise moment that I entered the story. Together with an old friend, I'd fought my way into the Roxy. No small feat of arms in those days. To see and hear a girl who had long been my favorite singer. It's still my contention that in no single engagement of the war... were there so many high-ranking stomachs... so many high-ranking toes directly in the line of fire. - [Moans] - Sorry, sir. % % [Orchestra] % % [Backup Singers Harmonizing] [Jane] % Where are you% % Where are you% % Night% % And a million stars% % Are falling% % From another world% % I hear you calling% [Jane] % Calling% % Oh, I know that we meet every night% % And we couldn't have changed since the last time% % To my joy and delight% % It's a new kind of love% % At first sight% % Though it's you and it's I all the time% % Every meeting's a marvelous pastime% [Both] % You're increasingly sweet% % So whenever we happen% % To meet% % I greet you% % With a song in my heart% % I behold your adorable face% % Just a song at the start% % But it soon is a hymn to your grace% % When the music swells% % I'm touching your hand% % It tells me% % You're standing near% % And% % At the sound of your voice% % Heaven opens its portals to me% % Can I help but rejoice% % That a song such as ours came to be% % But I always knew% % I would live life through% [Both] % With a song in my heart% % For% % You% % At the sound of your voice% % At the sound of your voice% % Heaven opens its portals to me% % Can I help but rejoice% % Can I help but rejoice% % That a song such as ours came to be% % But I always knew% % I would live life through% [Both] % With a song in my heart% % For% % You% % [Don Narrating] Twenty-four hours later, shots and aching muscles notwithstanding... Jane was on a plane bound for London by way of Bermuda and Lisbon. In addition to the 12 members of the crew... there were 27 passengers aboard. Among them, seven entertainers from the U.S. O... a few businessmen, several diplomats who... believe it or not, looked like diplomats... and a brigadier general of the air force... an elderly flyer of at least 34. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for a moment, please? On behalf of Captain Donovan and the crew, I want to welcome you aboard. It's all right to unfasten your seat belts now. If anyone's dying for a cigarette, go ahead. - I say, what's the weather ahead? - Very good, sir. It's a little on the chilly side, but indications are it'll be good all the way. Now, for the benefit of those of you who may be making your first transatlantic flight... or who may be worrying about the war... all I can say is this ship has made 240 crossings without being shot at once. Captain Donovan has flown at least a hundred crossings himself. By the way, my name is John Burn. I'm fourth officer aboard, which means I'm third copilot. If there's anything that I or the stewards can do to make your flight more comfortable... please sing out. Incidentally, each of you has been assigned a seat. We'll appreciate it if you occupy the same seat on all takeoffs and landings. I've forgotten why, but the company prefers it that way. Which leads me to this. This is called a Mae West. Delicacy prevents my saying why. [Passengers Chuckling] While an emergency is very unlikely... it's still my duty to acquaint you with our landing procedure just in case. But to get back to Miss West. I wonder if you'd mind assisting me in demonstrating it, Miss Froman? - Will it be becoming? - On ladies of your coloring, it's practically irresistible. Now we just slip it on like grandpa's vest. That's right. Now for the straps. See, we cross the bottom straps in front. Here we are. You circle the waist. Bring 'em back around. - Then we tie them, snuggly. - [Gasps] - Too tight? - Just a little. I'll loosen it. There you are. Now for the top straps. Uh, maybe you'd better do that. - Can you get 'em out? - I think so. Here we are. That's right. Now, just a simple knot. - Or if you have strong feelings about such things, a bow. - I like a bow. There you are. Isn't that attractive? They tell me at Bergdorf and Goodman they're chewing their nails off with envy. It's very simple to inflate too. You pull these small knobs at the base of the jacket. - [Air Releasing] - [Gasps] - [Laughter] - Now you see why the navy calls 'em Mae Wests. Thank you, Miss Froman. May I help you get out of it? - I think I can manage. - Thank you again. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The stewards will now pass among you with playing cards and coffee. The coffee's excellent. The cards are probably marked. Thank you, and have a nice trip. He makes it sound so exciting, I can hardly wait to be shot down. Don't even mention such a thing. I've just had a new permanent. % And the skies are not cloudy% % All day% % Home% % Home on the range% % Where the deer and... % Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. I hate to break this up, General... but the next time I'm at the Met, I'll be glad to put in a word for you. - I'll settle for Minsky's. - That I can arrange. We're now approaching Lisbon. We'll land on the Tagus River in exactly three minutes. So take your seats, please, fasten your seat belts, and no smoking. Thank you. - Three minutes. Step on it. - It'll take me that long to get my face on. I hope we get a chance to see some of Lisbon. I heard it's a beautiful city. Me too. I've never been here. We're right on schedule. - What time is it? - 6:44, Lisbon time. Oh, my goodness. I'm in the wrong seat. It doesn't matter. I'll take yours. But that nice young man, Mr. Burn, told us to occupy the same seat. What possible difference can it make whether Jane Froman sits there or Jennifer March? - To them, we're just seat numbers anyhow. - Yes, I guess you're right. But I can't imagine what I was thinking of. [No Audible Dialogue] [No Audible Dialogue] - [Explosion] - [Screaming] [Air Raid Siren Wailing] [Speaking Portuguese] [Sirens Wailing] [Chattering] [Man] Nurse? Nurse? [Latin] Hey, nurse. Will somebody stop this babble long enough to tell me what shape I'm in? Do I need an aspirin or an operation? Nurse? Nurse? - How many have been brought in? - [Portuguese] I thought I heard somebody say 15. Fifteen out of 39. I want to know how many. [Portuguese] [People Chattering In Portuguese] Could I have some water? Water, somebody? How do you say... Water? Agua? Doesn't anybody around here speak English? Take it easy, kid. You'll get water when the doctor says so and not before. - You're an American. - And what's wrong with that? You keep still till the doctor gets finished. - Is it bad? - You'll be all right. I'm supposed to be in London. Will I be able to sing? Like a nightingale in Berkeley Square. Put this under your tongue. Nurse, can you find out if a girl by the name of Jennifer March has been brought in? Listen. Will you stop worrying about who's here and who isn't. Leave that to St. Christopher or whose-ever business it is to take care of those things. And you keep this thermometer under your tongue. [Man Speaking Portuguese] [Portuguese] Senora, do you wish the truth? Your right leg is almost severed below the knee. It's a compound fracture. There are also three broken ribs and a crushed left ankle. It may be necessary to amputate your right leg. If you do decide to amputate, would you please tell me first? I will tell you. - Get her ready for surgery immediately. - Yes, Doctor. What were they saying about him? Nothing. Nothing at all. Just a lot of Portuguese double-talk. They don't think he has much chance, do they? Where'd you get that idea? He's fine. The doctor was saying it would be just a waste of time to operate, wasn't he? Wasn't he? Look. They'll operate, and they'll save him. I don't care what they say. Or I'll burn this joint down. All right, boys, she's all yours. Take it easy. Watch her leg now. Good luck. [Nurse Narrating] Now, don't ask me how we did it, but we pulled them through. All 15 survivors, including John Burn. Of course it was touch and go for some of them these past weeks... but we did it. Unfortunately, Jennifer March, who had changed seats with Jane for that one landing... wasn't one of them. Don't ask me how or why things like that happen either. Any more than why, when they raised the plane... the only thing of Janes they recovered... was this little gold cross which had been given to her... by a kid from Syracuse she'd never even seen. On the other hand, if you're interested in such things as courage and morale... drop around with a bottle of scotch some afternoon when I'm off duty... and I'll be glad to grant you an interview. Because on that subject, I am now an authority. [John] Mmm. Oh, boy. Oh, if I could just get a little lower. - Feel good? - Oh, words fail me. Nothing in the world like it. I know. I can stand pain... anything. But to itch and not be able to scratch it... that I can't stand. The man who thought of making these knitting needles out of plastic... so he can go around corners ought to get a D.S.C. D.S.C., my eye. He oughta be canonized. - Ah, Miss Stomach Bump of 1943. - All right. - Open your traps and swallow these down. - Not again. You oughta be grateful I'm not still stickin' you in the caboose with a needle. - Here you are. - [John] Thank you. [Gasps] Mercy me! If it isn't a reptile! - How'd this get in here? - Why, I haven't the slightest idea. - Go on. Drink it. - Me? Drink that? - Down the hatch. - What are you trying to do, poison me? - It's a tempting idea. - General, you ought to be ashamed of yourself... scaring a poor angel of mercy like Clancy. Listen. You couldn't scare this Flatbush Florence Nightingale... - with Rommel's whole Africa Corps. - Is that so? Well, for that crack you're going to eat intravenously from now on. Wait a minute, Clancy. There's something I've been wanting to ask you. First of all, how did you ever get to be a nurse? Second, what are you doing over here? Question one: I was hit over the head... with a pair of forceps at birth... and when I came to, I was in uniform. Question two: When the war broke out... I joined an ambulance corps from Flatbush to get away from my relatives. - Does that answer you? - Right on the nose. Okay. Here we go, General Pershing. Hey! Give us back our frog. Ask the mother superior for it. - She's gonna find it in her bed tomorrow morning. - [Jane Laughing] - Don't you just love her? - I'm crazy about her. I'd probably elope with her if I weren't already in love with you. Oh, stop it. I mean it, Jane. I had no right to say that, did I? No. Even though it's true? I know you're not happy the way things have been. - [Door Opens] - Good morning. Oh, good morning, Father. - How are you feeling today? - Very well, thank you. Good. [Door Closes] Shall I go on? Or have I already said too much? I admit there's a bond between us. That's only natural after all we've been through. And then being here together every day since the accident... It's more than that. You know it. Ever since that first night, we've clung to each other. We've depended on each other. Maybe that's because we like the same things... the same books, the same music. Jane, people can't go through what we've been through... and then go right on acting as if nothing had happened. [Door Opens] - Pardon me, but somebody's got company. - Hi. - Don! - Remember me? - Where in the world... - Flew over. How else? F.D.R. Gave us a priority. Wants me to bring you on home. Let me look at you. I didn't know what to expect, a crack-up like that... - but you look swell. - Well, I'm all right. They tell me you're gonna be fine. Maybe a little operation or two on the leg... but at least everything's under control. That's what they tell me too. I hope they're right. Don, this is Mr. Burn. John, my husband, Don Ross. - Oh, so youre John Burn, one of the pilots. How are you? - Very well, thank you. And this is Clancy. Miss Clancy. - We met. - Yes, in the room. Look. I've got passage for us... on a Portuguese steamer sailing next Tuesday. It may be a little rugged, but I want to get you home where we can really take care of you. - Think you can make it? - We'll make it. Clancy! You'll go with us? Remember those relatives I was telling you about? I just got a wire. Two of them have been drafted. They're just as likely to show up even here. So it's back to Flatbush for me. - You ready to go to your room? - Uh, yes, please. Why don't you come with us, Mr. Burn? - I think I can fix it. - Thanks. I'll wait and fly back. But, John, I thought you said we'd... Sorry, l... It's nice to have met you, Mr. Ross. Yeah, sure. Glad to have met you. - See you later. - You bet. - Seems like a nice guy. - He is. - Hurt bad? - His back... a couple of fractured vertebrae. Tell me, did you have a nice flight over? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Just a breeze. Not a bump all the way. [Don Narrating] And then home sweet home... through submarine infested waters and straight into another hospital. They'd done their best for her in Lisbon. But now she needed more than the best. She needed a miracle. Oh, excuse me, Doctor. I didn't know you were here. - That's all right, Sister. - I can come back later. No, no. Come in. - Aren't they lovely? - [Jane] Beautiful. Wouldn't you like one for your lapel, Doctor? - May I? - All doctors should wear roses in their lapels. Then maybe they wouldn't look so serious and so infallible. Also prettier. I'll take those, Sister. Thank you. You must have a rich admirer. Anybody I know? - John Burn. - Burn? He sent those all the way from Lisbon? Well, he arrived in New York this morning. Pretty quick work. Well, Doctor? Am I still photogenic? It's a beautiful picture, but I'm afraid it's not such a pretty break. That bone's not knitting the way it should. What are we gonna do about it? I know. Let's send it out to Max Factor in Hollywood. He makes over old faces. Maybe he can make over an old leg. [Chuckling] Well, that's a possibility. In the meanwhile, I would say a bone graft is indicated. And that's a very delicate operation. I can't guarantee success. What percentage of such operations are successful, Doctor? Oh, between 50% and 60%. A great deal depends on the patient. A good patient, one with a lot of desire to get well... can make a bad doctor look awfully good. - Are you a good patient? - Terrible. I'll probably kick and howl. - When will you operate? - Personally, I would say the sooner the better. What would you say about tomorrow? Well, I was booked to ride in the fourth at Belmont tomorrow. - You can always be scratched. - Then see that I am, Clancy. No use our keeping the doctor on pins and needles any longer than we have to. Will you come with me, Mr. Ross? I want to show these to Dr. Jameson, my associate. - I'd like you to be present. - Of course. Take it easy. I'll be right back. They're gonna take my leg off, Clancy. Who said so? He didn't have to say so. I know. Ah, you don't want to pay any attention to doctors. They gotta view with alarm, so that later they can point with pride. You know? Like... Like politicians. [Phone Ringing] I'll get it. Hello? Well, welcome home. [Chuckling] Sure, I'm true to you. Wait a minute. - Who is it? - Don't be so nosy. Here. - Hello? - Hi. John! Where are you? Doctor's Hospital. I'm in the X-ray room trying to find out when they're gonna take this crate off me... after which, in case you didn't suspect it... I'm gonna beat a path right straight to your door. What do you know about that? Well, l... I'm not gonna be able to see anybody for a while. Well, how are you? How was everything in Lisbon when you left? Don't change the subject. You have missed me, haven't you? Never mind. Don't answer that. I just wanted to hear your voice. - All ready, Mr. Burn. - Okay. Sorry. I gotta run now. They want me to pose again. But I'll be seeing you. Oh! Tell Clancy I love her too. Good-bye. Here you are. Thank you. - You gonna see him? - If he wants to come. Is that wise? No, I suppose it isn't, but... [Crying] Oh, Clancy, what am I going to do? There, there. None of that now. I've never known anyone like him. When he's with me, I don't even hurt as much. I've learned to lean on him so. I know. I know. I don't want to hurt Don. But, Clancy, I'm in love. For the first time in my life, I'm really in love. I've tried not to think about him. I keep telling myself that nothing can come of it. But I need him... and I want to see him. [Crying] What should I do? Well... The first thing you should do is blow your nose and powder it... before somebody comes back in here. Here. Use this. Now this is no time to get yourself all worked up emotionally... and start acting like a female. When you're through with all this, you'll have plenty of time to decide. But right now, let's do what the doctor said. Give him a break. Right? That's my girl. [Groans] [Slurring] Clancy. I'm here, honey. Now you go back to sleep. Rest is what you need. - Clancy? - How you feel? Still a little woozy? [Slurring, Indistinct] Don't worry, kid. It's still there. Sister Marie! A piano? Yes, Sister. It's for Miss Froman. She's going to rehearse for a new show. Rehearse? In her condition? Why, she can't even walk. Dr. Taylor considers work a very good therapy, Sister. Also, Miss Clancy says she can use... I hope you'll pardon the expression, Sister... but Miss Clancy says she can also use a few "bucks." Excuse me, Sister, they're waiting for us now. - [Knocking] - [Clancy] Come in. Well, here we are. Where would you like it? Uh, right over here I think. That oughta do right there. Thank you very much. I'll take care of that. Thank you, fellas. Thank you, Sister. We'll try to be as quiet as we can. Don't worry about the noise. That heart case next door has gone home. - You won't disturb a soul. - Good. Oh, I don't suppose you'd want any outsiders to hear you rehearse? Well, I guess our secret will be safe with you, Sister. Stick around if you want. May I? Oh, thank you. I'm so crazy about music. I promise to be as still as a mouse. It's all right. Glad to have you. First I'm gonna play your theme song. This comes right after the opening number when the artists come on. As the curtains part, you're sitting there... better still, standing... if we can figure some way to prop you up. You're posing for this artist, the tenor... That's you, Clancy. Well, that's typecasting, all right. [Don] As it happens, you're nuts about Jane... but there are reasons why you can't tell her so yet. I know one good reason. I ain't a boy. Well, he walks over to you, and you have a few lines of dialogue. You know, love stuff. You say, uh, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." And then, Clancy, you say, "Blah, blah, blah, blah..." Who wrote this, Eugene O'Neill? [Don] After which, you go into your song. I'll play it for you. But before I play that... I want to do the opening for you so you can picture the whole scene. First we bring the artists on like this. % Montparnasse% % We are the artists of the Montparnasse% % And though our paintings are comme ci comme ca% % What do we care% % Ooh, la, la% % We love to share our savoir-faire in Montparnasse% Right here we bring the chorus on, the models. That's you, Sister. Step back by the door. I'll tell you when to come on. We're gonna have about 20 of the best looking dames we can find. Typical artist models, which means they'll have on as little as the law allows. This is their music. % Montparnasse% % We are the models and we pose for those we love% That's you, Sister. Come on. And be sure and keep in step with the music. - % Montparnasse We are the mo... % - Don. - Just a minute, if you don't mind. - Yes? Maybe Sister Marie doesn't want to be a model. What? Oh, I'm sorry, Sister. I didn't mean to offend you. L... Oh, I'm not offended in the least. Yeah, but l... You see, I sort of got carried away in it. - Let me get you a chair. - You mean you're not gonna use me anymore? Well, after all, Sister, this is a bunch of chorus girls. But it's the first time I've ever been in a chorus. And if I have to go back and tell the other sisters I was fired, they'd never forgive me. - But I couldn't ask you... - Let me do it, Sister. I'm more the type. - You can be the tenor. - Oh, thank you. Okay, professor. Let's go. Swing it. % Montparnasse% % We are the models and we pose... % % % % [Orchestral "Montparnasse'"] [Clancy Narrating] I'm here to tell the cockeyed world... stage history was made that night. To be perfectly frank, none of us knew what to expect. Here was a girl with a 35-pound cast on her leg... who'd have to be carried on and off the stage 22 times a performance... making her first public appearance since the accident. The big question in all our minds was... would the audience take her this way? More important still, could she stand the gaff? There you are, honey. - [Grunts] - [Gasps] - [Clancy] What'd you do? Are you hurt? - No, I'm all right. - What happened? - I just dropped my handkerchief. Watch your leg. You know better than to lean over like that. I wouldn't have caused this much excitement if I'd ridden in on a horse like Lady Godiva. - That's a good act too, but your hair ain't long enough. - Are you all right? - Yes, of course. - All right. Then clear. Clear the stage. % % [Finale] - Gee, I hope she's... - Don't worry. She'll be fine. % % [Orchestra Swells] [Clancy Narrating] Well, we had our answer. They still wanted Froman. But even while they were still cheering in Boston, we had to close. That leg had begun to act up again. Now the really rugged days were beginning. Ahead lay long dreary weeks and months... of suffering, of uncertainty, bitterness, despair... more doctors, more consultations, more X-rays, more bone grafts. Seldom if ever out of pain... excruciating pain. Once or twice, near death itself. In and out of a dozen hospitals, always facing another operation. Ten, 20... So many in fact that even I began to lose track of them. Twenty-one, 22... Tumors, abscesses, nervous exhaustion... endless hours with psychiatrists... sometimes not caring whether she lived or died. And always with the threat hanging over her head... that next time that leg would have to come off. Here we are. Mmm. That looks good. [Sniffs] - Smells good too. - Hmm. - What's the matter with you? - I'm not hungry. None of that now. You've got to eat. Why? Why do I have to eat? I'm sick of it. I'm sick of all of it. Why don't they just go ahead and cut it off and be done with it? They know I'll never walk again. Why don't they admit it? - Who says you'll never walk again? - I do. And I'm fed up with hearing you and everybody else say that I will. I know I'll never be a normal woman again. I'll never dance. I'll never go shopping. I'll never do any of the things other women do. I can't even remember what it was like to wear a decent pair of shoes. So why go on fighting it and kidding myself? I hope they do take it off. I'll be glad to get it over with. Now wait a minute. That's just about enough of that kind of talk. Sure, you've had your share of it. Do you think I've sat around here day after day watching you suffer... without knowing what you've been going through? Why do you think I stayed with you? 'Cause I thought you had it in you to keep on punching without feeling sorry for yourself. But don't you see? I'm tired of punching. I'm tired of fighting. I've had enough. I'm sick of it! You're sick of it? Well, I've got news for you. This has been no picnic for me either. But I said to myself, "This baby's got what it takes. Nothing's gonna get her down." And now all of a sudden you start bellyaching. Well, that's your business. But let's get one thing straight right now! Nobody feels sorry for themselves around me. Nobody cries on my shoulder. And the minute they start it, they can get themselves another girl. Because I've got more important things to do with my life. And if you've got your heart set on being a freak or an invalid... that's okay with me. Of course you've still got your face and your voice. That'd be enough for most women. But not you. Because you haven't got what it takes... guts! [Crying] [Clancy Narrating] Whether that bit of ham acting did it or not, I don't know. All I do know is that we didn't have any more of that kind of talk. In fact, as soon as the doctors gave the word... she was right in there pitching again. With debts mounting daily, with doctors to be paid... nurses, hospital bills... it was work or else. Under the circumstances, New York's La Riviera was the answer. - Good evening, Miss Froman. - Hello, Joan. % % [Orchestra] Thank you. Don, it's beginning to fill up. You know I never like to be out front before a show. What's the matter? Superstitious? Like a bride about being seen on her wedding day? I'm afraid it might spoil the illusion if they see me in a wheelchair or on crutches. Sorry, but I thought this would be a good chance to talk... frankly and in public... where we couldn't go emotional. What is there to talk about? % % [Continues] I happen to know how often you've been seeing John Burn. Well, I've never tried to hide the fact that I've been seeing him. It's... It's all been open and aboveboard. That's beside the point. All I want is a simple answer. Yes or no. Me or him? Do we have to decide that tonight? I've got two shows to do. You can't keep putting these things off forever. Well, can't we wait just a few days until I can think more rationally? - % % [Continues] - You wouldn't have to think... if you'd just make up your mind not to see him again. Would that solve anything? Please, Don. All right. But what am I supposed to do? Exit laughing? Don't my feelings count? I know it's a tragic thing that's happening to us, to our marriage... Don't talk as if we'd done something wrong, because we haven't. Okay. But there has to be a showdown sometime, and it might as well be now. - [Jane]John. - Hello. - Hello, Burn. Glad you could make it. How are you? - Fine, thanks. I forgot to tell you. I asked Mr. Burn to have dinner with us tonight. Slide in next to Jane for a minute while I make a phone call. - What'll you have... scotch, cocktail? - Uh, martini, thanks. I'll send the waiter right over with it. Excuse me. - He didn't have to make a phone call. - I know. - He thinks it's time for a showdown. - % % [Ends] [Applause] So do I. - % % [Orchestra Resumes] - What's the answer? I'm not going to see you again. Is... Is that what you want? I don't know. Maybe not. But that's the way it has to be. He's still my... Responsibility? My husband... for better or for worse. I'll still write. I'll still phone. I won't answer. % % [Continues] It's really because you're not sure about your leg, isn't it? As if that mattered... could affect the way I feel about you. Max, would you help me back to my dressing room? Certainly, Miss Froman. - Jane. - Please don't make it harder for me... by saying anything more now. - Shall I go with you? - No, thanks. Max and I can manage. Good night. Good night. % % [Continues] - What? All alone? - Yes. - Now if you'll excuse me... - What's your hurry? Stick around and watch the show with me. - No, thanks.

Haven't you ever been taken for a ride before? - Sure, but not like this. - [Audience Laughing] % I love all% % The many charms about you% % Above all% % I want my arms about you% Having trouble?

Oh, wait a minute. You're not through yet. - This field maneuver's just getting started. - [Laughing] Wouldn't you be more comfortable up here? Oh, come on. It's not much of a jump for a paratrooper. Now, isn't there some special song you'd like? - I like 'em all. - I know one. - Oh, tell me, do you sing too? - Not me. - Can't you even hum a little? - I'm afraid not. All right.

About as much as I'd like to get kicked in the head by a mule. - Why? - I was just thinking. Why shouldn't I go over and finish what I started three years ago? If I only had a jack to put on that queen. Of course, I suppose the doctors will throw up their hands in holy horror. Ah, phooey to doctors. This deck has been stacked. The army might think it's too great a nuisance carting me around. They manage to cart around a lot of tanks and bazookas. I know a couple of top sergeants that could handle it. Well, certainly I'm no good to myself or anybody here. Maybe I could do a little good over there. What about, uh, "Buster"? It should be a relief to him. And the "Wild Blue Yonder"? You know as well as I do that as long as there's a chance I might lose this leg. L... That's where you're different from me. If I had a bad leg and a guy was crazy about me, I'd figure I was lucky. - Why? - My love life might not be so vulnerable. Vulnerable? Look, this has nothing to do with you, you understand. I'm talking about another couple of dames. Pure hypothetical. See? But just for the sake of argument... let's say one of them had the prettiest pair of legs in the world. Regular pinup girl. All the men beatin' their brains out tryin' to marry her... millionaires, dopes, playboys. So she gets married, and three columnists swoon just writing about it. But before you know it... she starts worrying about what's gonna happen... when maybe she hasn't got the prettiest legs in the world... and how nice it would be if she could sit back and relax and say to herself... there was something else he married her for. Like maybe he was in love with her. Or maybe he admired her spirit or her stamina or something. - Clancy, you're wonderful. - That's why the lovelorn all come to me for advice. "Cuddles Clancy" they call me. Okay, Beatrice Fairfax, my pogo sticks. - Where you goin'? - To tell Don. - You need any help? - Nope. Call Mr. Stone at the U.S.O. And ask him to come right over, will you? - And tell him to bring my passport with him. - On the double. [Engine Revving] [Revving Continues] - What gives? - Sure is stuck. - Where you from, soldier? - Kansas. Kansas, huh? Well, this car belongs to another boy from Kansas, name of Eisenhower. - Ya ever hear of him? - No, ma'am. He must belong to another outfit. Oh, yeah? Well, he's the toughest top sergeant you ever heard of... and you'll hear from him if you don't get your shoulders to that wheel. Now come on. Let's get goin'. Yes, ma'am. [Chattering] Thanks, Captain. All right. Settle down, men. Settle down. We have a special guest this afternoon... a young lady who's come all the way from New York to sing for you. She tried to come over a couple of years ago, but things didn't work out. This time she made it. I know you're going to like her. Miss Jane Froman. [Whistling] [Wolf Whistle] How long do I have, Colonel? As long as you wish, Miss Froman. Well, we may be here from now on. I'm sure the men would love it. I'm going to start with a favorite of mine. After that, if there's something you'd like to hear, just sing out.

This bunch even went A-W-O-L for two weeks... hitchhiking over half of Europe to follow her around. Anybody here from Missouri? Oh, come on. Now there must be somebody here from Missouri. - That state's still in the union, isn't it? - [Soldiers Laughing] Well, come on. Stand up. Don't be bashful. Let's see you. - Oh, no. Not him. - Why not? What's wrong with him? - Shell shock. I'd better stop him. - Leave him alone. She can handle him. Hi there. What part of Missouri are you from? Don't tell me you're from my own hometown. Not from Clinton. Let me guess. Saint Louis. Independence? [Chuckles] All right. I give up. You tell me. Ch... Char... Charlottesville. Charlottesville, Missouri? Vir... Virginia. - Oh, Charlottesville, Virginia. - [Soldiers Laughing] Well, that's close enough to Missouri for me. I suppose all the girls say this, but... haven't I seen you someplace before? - Where? - La... La Riviera Club, New York. Of course! The piano. "Embraceable You." Why, we did a whole act together. How would you like me to sing something now just for you? You name it. If I know it, I'll sing it. "I'll Walk Alone." I love that song. It's one of my favorites. I can't believe it.

Ready with your long-distance call to Miami. Thank you. Hello? Hello, Burn? This is Don Ross in New York. How are ya? Don Ross? I'm fine. How are you? How's Jane? Well, she's fine. Still overseas, but about ready to head back home. That's what I called you about. I thought you might like to know I won't be around when she lands. Yeah, that's right. About time I started lookin' after myself for a change, isn't it? When's she arriving? How should I know? You can check if you're interested. What's that? Why am I telling you all this? Well, I'll tell ya, Burn. I'm a great guy, see? A little tight today maybe, but great. I don't think you ever appreciated me. Jane and I were washed up long ago. I didn't want to walk out on her while she was still having trouble. But now that she's doing okay again, why stick around and pretend? Oh, by the way... next time you see her, will you tell her I said this might make a great plot. Girl meets boy. Girl gets boy. Girl loses boy. Where you gonna find a twist like that every day? Huh? Okay. Good-bye. See you around. - [Chattering] - Attaboy, mule-face. [Man] Hold it up so we can see it. [Man] Hey, mule-face, where'd you get them candles? Reims Cathedral, you dope. Where do you think we got 'em? - What'd they cost you? - Nothing. We stole 'em. - % % [Drumroll] - [Whooping] Go on, you stupe! Give it to her! Yeah, while the candles are still burning. What's the matter? You got stage fright? Hey, you guys! Pipe down, will ya? Let's take it easy. Miss Froman, I ain't gonna make no speech. - [Cheering] - Ah, cut it out! Well, maybe it ain't your birthday exactly... but you're going home tomorrow, and, before you go... us guys want to tell you just one thing. Well, we want to thank you for comin'. It sure meant a lot to us over here. Mmm. Anyhow, this is for you. Thank you. - Thanks, fellas. - Read the card. You read it, Clancy. "To Jane Froman, a great soldier... "who, though wounded herself, didn't forget us wounded. Bon voyage. The Gang." [Applauding] Speech! Speech! [Man] Speech.! - What can I say? - Don't say. Use your breath and blow these out. As you all know, Clancy and l... we're going home tomorrow. For the past three months, we've had the wonderful privilege... of doing over a hundred different shows for you men. But there'll never be another night like this. For that reason, the boys and the girls and myself... have worked out a special farewell number. - Would you like to hear it? - [Cheering] Okay, let's go.
