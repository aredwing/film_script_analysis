It represents the evolution of the human race, although marking some of your work you would hardly think that was the case. - Excellent. - (Whispers) Oh, Daddy's little girl. That, Mr Knight, is fantastic... ...if you're in the first year of primary school. Perhaps you'd feel a little happier with crayons, colouring in little kittens. Are you going somewhere, Mr...? Oh! Oh... You OK? Dad? 'How are you feeling, Robert? Fine. I think I'll be ready to come back next week. It must have been a horrible ordeal. We asked you here, because we're very keen to resolve this issue without... Unnecessary legal complications. Philip Knight leaves at the end of this year? There's only three months to the end of term so, with that in mind, we should be able to come to some satisfactory compromise. You're not thinking of letting that boy back in my classroom, are you? I'm not sure you understand the situation, Mr Anderson. The parents of the boy in question are threatening to sue you personally. And the school. Now I'm sure you are aware that giving the students Fs has long been against national guidelines. It was a fail. Sarah, it was barely even literate. "RS". Resubmission. That's how you're required to label it. Giving a student an F is just felt to be humiliating for the child. And Mrs Knight feels that you provoked Philip into attacking you - by belittling him in front of others. - This is my fault? We're very keen not to assign blame here, Mr Anderson. We're suggesting you take extended leave until the end of term and then we will welcome you back with open arms. Robert, please, can you...? I-I am so sorry. (Alarm beeps) (Laughter and jeering) (Tap on window) Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you. No, you didn't. Em... - You look very nice. - Thank you. Boiler broke this morning. Couldn't even have a shower. On, right. I'll...I'll pop over tonight. No, no, you don't have to. I'll call a plumber. It's really not your speciality. Plumbing. I'll take a look. it's not a problem. OK. Thank you. I just wanted to have a chat about next weekend. I know it's your weekend with Kate, but, um... - Helen, you don't have to worry. - I don't? I haven't forgotten our daughter's birthday. - No... - I'm taking her to the theatre. - You could come if you like. - Oh, that sounds really nice. But she asked me to ask you if you wouldn't mind if she went to London with some friends to see a band. Right. I'm sure she'll ask you herself. So there's going to be an adult with them, yeah? Oh, Robert, you know, she's... I'll think about ii. I...I have to go. Are you looking after yourself? You look tired. - it's a busy time of year. - Yeah, of course. Of course. Don't be too hard on Katie. Please? So I'll see you tonight. Fucking hell... Good luck. Do we have any books about plumbing in the library? Possibly. Good. Good. (Groans) - (Knock) - Come in. Robert, please, take a seat. So how are things? Good. Fine. That's great. And how's it going with the Year 12s? Fine. I still seem to be missing some assessment grades for them. Yes. Sorry, I haven't sent those over. I'll do that. I know this time of year is a pain, but I really am going to need them. Yeah, of course. I'm really sorry. Let's see. I think I've almost done everything. Won't take me five minutes. Thanks, Robert. Just one other thing before you go. Some of the teachers have raised concerns about the noise level from your class. Well, em... All right. I'll get them to keep it down. Yes. It's probably nothing. You know how some people can get. But it was more about the actual language being used by the students. Robert? - I'll keep an eye on it. - Thanks. I appreciate that. Just one other thing. It's probably nothing. Crossed wires or something, but there's been a complaint about, em... ...about you bringing in alcohol to the premises. - I cannot think what that's about. - I know, I know. It's probably, as I said, just crossed wires. I know you'd never do such a thing because it would mean suspension. Exactly. Thanks, Robert. I think I might pop into your class tomorrow. OK? Nothing to be concerned about. I'll just sit at the back and observe. - Of course. - Thanks, Robert And Robert... Please, never send a memo like that across the staff network again without consulting me first. He stinks of booze. (Sarah) I am trying to get rid of him, but the unions won't let me. (Lift pings) Hold the door! You look shit. Nice memo, by the way. But... ...how we perceive ourselves... ...may not be how we are perceived by others. Lear believes himself to be a good and responsible monarch. However, Goneril, Regan and the Fool constantly remind him that he is a man who has... ...lost... ...his kingdom, his faithful daughter and his wits through his own... (Pen squeaks) ..folly. This is shown... (Pupils laugh) You will report for an hour's detention each night for a week. Starting tonight. (Bell rings) Kate... An right? - Anything going on? - Not really. What's this? It's a memo from Anderson. Sent out to all members of staff. "Did you know there were nearly "affecting teachers, janitors, dinner ladies and cleaners last year?" Is he for real? Does he want gun detectors and searching kids' bags? -I dunno. - Guy's a nut bag. I'm going for a smoke. I'll start locking up the gates. Yeah, all right. Let's have a look. Oi! What do you think you're doing? - Night, Miss. - Night. (Mobile phone beeps) Kate... Put the phone away. - I'll give this to your mother tonight. - That's so unfair. Kate, unfair is when something happens for no reason. This is bullshit. You're bullshit. A pathetic man who puts his daughter in detention just to spend time with her. Please, Kate, that's enough. So afraid he drinks a bottle of whisky before stepping in a classroom. - Please, just sit down... - No! Our lives are better without you. Mum said she'd rather be alone forever than get back with you. Ohh... Oh... Hello! Hello! Let me out! Ah... Jeez. Aaargh! Ah, fuck. What the fuck...? What the fuck? What are you doing? Fuck... Get out! Aargh. Hey! Let me out of here! You're in so much fucking trouble! Hey... No! Hey! Hey! Let me out! Help! Help me! Get me out of here! Let me out! No! Please! God! No! Hey, Jake, it's me. No, I'm using the phone in Reception. Can you come and pick me up? Just come and pick me up. Jake? Jake! (Sighs) The, um, the phone's not working. (Clears throat) Yeah, the...the line's down. That's it? I'm sure the phone company will fix it soon. OK. Come on, damn you - bruise. - What is it? - There's someone out there. - I don't see anyone. - No, there was someone watching me. I swear I saw someone! You're... You're Mr Anderson's girl, ain't you? For fuck's sake. Jesus Chri...! (Door slams) Mr Anderson. I-low can I help you? - I think there are kids in the building. - It IS a school. One of them threw something against the window. - Threw what? - A milkshake. - A milkshake? - Are you a parrot? Yes, a milkshake! What flavour? I'm glad that you End this amusing. (Sighs) What do you want me to do about it, Mr Anderson? I'd like you to do your job instead of looking at pictures of naked men. - it's a fitness magazine. - Fantastic. - Whereabouts? - E Block corridor. - You and your daughter are just as bad. - You've seen my daughter? - She was here 10 minutes ago. -Why? To use the phone but the lines are down. - Since when? - Half an hour ago? - And this doesn't worry you? - No, Mr Anderson, it doesn't. So where was she going? Back into the school. Maybe she threw the milkshake. - What are you doing? - I'm calling the police! Calm down, Mr Anderson. I'll sort this out. You go and find your daughter. The police will hardly come out over a spilt milkshake. Fucking Jesus Christ! (Music from radio) (Switches music off) Who's there? I tell you, if I catch you little brats, you're going to have hell to pay! Kate? Ah! Oh, sh... - I'm sorry. - After your plumbing books? Have you seen my daughter? Kate? The last time I saw her in the library was about a year ago! Is something up? We just had a bit of an argument. And then she stormed off. - In the toilets having a cigarette? - She doesn't smoke. Of course she doesn't. It'll be fine. Wait here, keep me company while I finish up. I know teenage girls. Give her a chance to calm down. No, I think I'd better find her. You see, I think there are... ...kids inside the building. The phones, they've all stopped working. - You should leave. - OK. Where are you going? I need to find my daughter. And you should leave now! Right. Robert? Shit! Unbelievable! You think that's funny? Some of you children don't deserve to be in school. We'll see how funny you think this is when you have to explain it to your parents. (Faint rustle) You are in so much trouble. (Door opens) Kate, it's me. - Fuck! You scared the shit out of me. - I was outside. Yeah, some creepy guy was watching me. But I wasn't expecting you for ages. - (Knocking) - Kate, are you in there? Kate? I can smell smoke. Kate, if you are in there, please, honey, we have to leave now. We won't say anything more about what happened earlier. I know you were upset and I was very... I was very tough on you. But, please, Kate... We have to go now. - Right. I'm coming in. - (Sarah) Robert? What on earth are you doing? I have to find my daughter. I'm sure if she's in the toilet, you should let her finish. But we have to leave now. I think we might be under attack. Why would you think that? - The phone lines were cut. - Cut? Yes! They're not working! Maybe the line is down. They're probably fixing it. Right. I was walking down the corridor. Someone threw something at the glass. I think it was a milkshake. Then they wrote in it, "U R dead"! (Sniggers) Jake Peoples. I might have known. He's your culprit, Mr Anderson. Come on. Right, Kate, you go home with your father. We'll deal with you on Monday. - My father hit me. - Sorry? My father hit me. IS this true? - This has got nothing to do with school. - Right. Go home how. I'll deal with you later. Now! - Come with me. We'll phone your mother. - That's not necessary... - Go home, Robert. - Please. This is very serious. I said go home. - Kate... - Listen! Don't make me call Security. Have some dignity. (Console beeps) (Thud) Hello? Hello? Ah! James, you scared me. Sorry, Miss Wright. I, uh... I just saw the light on. Yeah, Mr Anderson was worried about some kids running around the... Asked me to check it out. Right. Well, there's no one in here now. (He whispers) Bitch. (Taps keys on mobile phone) Hello? Is there someone there? Look, if this is some kind of joke, I don't think it's... Please don't hurt me. Please. Don't... Please! Oh, God! You do realise these are very serious allegations you're making? I need you to write down exactly what happened. I'm going to call your mother, so go into the staff room and use the desk there. I can see you're doing fuck all, Dad. Goodbye, Anderson. Oh, for Christ's sake! (Clears throat) Hi, James? It's Sarah. My phone's not working. OK, thanks, James. Oh, just one other thing. It's a bit of a sensitive issue, but there's been an incident between Mr Anderson and his daughter and I've asked him to leave the premises. Could you make sure he won't come back in? I think his state of mind is fragile at the moment. (Ringing tone) Oh... - (Phone rings) - Hello? - 'Mrs Anderson? - Yes? It's Sarah Balham here from Wittering College. - There's been a bit of an incident here. - Is Kate OK? No, your daughters fine. She's next door. However, she has made a serious complaint about your husband, and I think it's best if you come and collect her. - What are you talking about? - 'She claims he hit her.' What? Is she all right? No, she's fine, a bit shaken. But I think it is best that you come and collect her. Yeah, yeah. Yes, of course, of course. I'll... I'll be there in 20 minutes. We shall meet you down at reception. - 'Fine.' - Thank you. (Vacuum cleaner whines) (Glass smashes) (Smashes again) (Clatter) (Vacuum cleaner still on) Aaaagh! No, no, get, get out of... Get out of here! Get out of here. Get out of here! I've called the police. Look, I've called the police. Please get out of here. Leave me alone. Please... No! (Mobile phone ring tone) - Kate? - No, it's Robert. Listen, Helen, something's wrong. What the hell is going on, Robert? Sarah Balham just called and told me that you hit Kate. IS that true? 'Please tell me that's not true.' Oh, Helen... Helen, it wasn't like that. What was it like, Robert? I'm sorry, Helen. I can't talk to you about it now. 'No, listen, don't you dare! I need to know what happened.' - Call the police. - 'Robert?' Robert? Sarah? (Retches) (Rap music plays) Jake? Jake! (Turns music up) Kate? Kate? Kate! (Dials phone) (Woman) 'Which emergency service do you require?' - Police. - 'Please state your location' Wittering College. A member of staff has been killed and I think my daughter is in danger. 'Please bear with me one second, sir.' - (Man's voice) 'Mr Anderson'?' - It is... How did you know my name? 'We spoke last week. Five times. - 'This line is for emergencies only.' - I'm aware of that. 'Any queries regarding children loitering in cars outside...' This is an emergency. And my daughter is in this building somewhere. You've got to send somebody now! (Jake) Kate! Kate! (Mobile phone ring tone) Who the fuck are you? What do you want? (Door creaks) Got ya! it's you that's been messing around here? There's someone out there. They have knives. They were chasing me. You almost got me. I bet you pull that stunt with your father all the time. I'm telling you the truth. Have you been drinking? Are you on drugs? You need to call the police! You kids will say anything. (Clatter) A friend of yours? You better stay put. Don't go out there. I'm telling you, they have knives! I've had it With you fucking kids! (Sobbing) Help me. Christ! Christ! Christ! You little shit. You little shit. You little shit. Ughl (Distant screams) Agh! Aaaagh! Aargh! Aargh! Aargh! (Faint clicking sound) Agh! All right, Brian? I've just had Mrs Balham on the phone. She says Anderson has hit his own daughter. She wants me to take him off the... Whoa! - I need to find my daughter. - Right, that's it, you crazy old man! - Brian, Brian! - They've killed Sarah. Of course(!) Explain that to the police when they get here. Look at the screen. Please, just look at the damn screen! I've already called the police. They're on their way. Where is this? That's F Block. It's the art studio. Wait! Sarah told me to call the police when I saw you. Sarah is dead. I just spoke to her on the phone. Then speak to her again. (Ringing tone) Mrs Balham... 'I'm sorry. The number you have dialed is not in service at this time.' Now, would you help me find my daughter? Brian? Brian, are you reading me, mate? (Footsteps running) Kate... Brian, answer the fucking radio. Over. (Footsteps running) (He fetches) No! No! No... We've got to get out of here! We've got to get out of here! Listen to me! Help me find my daughter! I always told her to memorise where the cameras were, so she could be seen. Just in case. Kate! Fuck's sake, man, they'll hear you! Kate! Who are you? Please, just leave us alone, yeah? James, open the door. Open the damn door! James... James, please, just open the door. Yeah? Damn you! (Police siren wailing) Go round the side of the building and check everything's OK. I'll see if I can locate that waste of space security guard. Hey, you! I've got to get out of here. What's going on? - You've got to help me get out of here! - Calm down! - Let me go! You've got to let me go! - What's wrong with you? - You've got to help me get out of here. - What's going on? I'm warning you! (Sound of knives sharpening) Yeah? You fucking want some? (Sharpening sounds intensify) Kate? Dad? I knew you would come. Oh, my baby! It's all right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, my darling. I'm so sorry. Oh... Oh, I'm sorry. Dad! Kate... Kate! It's all right, my darling. Shh. It's all right, it's all right. It's all right, sweetheart. Come on. Come on. Come on, my darling. (She breathes heavily) It's all right, darling. It's all right. Don't worry. You just stay calm. We'll be in a hospital soon. Yes, darling, it's all right. Don't worry, I've got you now. I've got you. Hold on to the car. Lean on the car, my darling. It's all right. The car... There's a car there! - It's all right. Come on. - Dad, it's Mum's car. Dad! - Come on now... - Dad, it's Mum's car! - Oh, God. - Oh, please go back. - Oh, no. - Dad, you have to go back. If I don't get you to hospital, you'll die. Please, Dad, it's Mum's car though. No, please! - No! - Come on. No! No, Dad! If you do this, I'll hate you for ever. (Switches on ignition) Hello? Is there somebody there?
