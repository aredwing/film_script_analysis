Captain Kidd himself. Look at that stomach. I watched him eat once at a banquet. He didn't order a steak, he ordered a cow. You have to hand it to him. He loved to live. Yeah? Have you gone crazy? Let's go to press.! We've only got 18 minutes to catch the mail trains.! I got the greatest first page here since the Chicago fire! Old man Reynolds is dyin' and I'm gonna get the flash he's dead any minute! Let him die in the next edition.! And let the Herald beat us? He's gonna die for me, exclusive! He's mine! But the mail trains... He dies for me, not the Herald. But the advertisers... Tell the advertisers to go to the Herald.! What are you standin' around with your face hangin' out for? Gimme two columns on Reynolds' son flying in from Mexico. Right. You know, lump-in-the-throat stuff. "Only son flies to father's deathbed. Will he make it? Won't he make it?" Slobber all over the place, but keep it classy! And write it both ways, if he makes it or if he doesn't. As long as he has to go, please have him go not later than 9:20. That dirty Herald's been gettin' all the breaks. Yeah? What do you mean, he isn't dead yet? Frank, I gotta have some action! What am I supposed to do, hit him over the head? I've been standing in a foot of water and I caught a cold. You've got a cold. Reynolds is dying! At least he's doing it in a nice, warm bed. I got something. Two ravens from the national museum... are inside the house waiting to take his death mask. Seems you gotta do it right away. No, I didn't get their names. Wait a minute. Somebody's coming. It's a car! Must be Reynolds' son. How do I know? 'Cause he came up the wrong way on a one-way street! Frank, I'm warnin' you, if Reynolds isn't dead within a half hour, don't come back here! Go ahead, threaten me! I got pneumonia! He's getting out of the car. It's the Reynolds kid, all right! He's goin'in the house.! There he goes. Hello, Roberts. It's good you got here in time, sir. Hello,Johnny. How is he, Doctor? Not so good. There's a chance, isn't there? Isn't there? He's had a rich, full life. A man couldn't ask for more than he's been given. No, I guess not. He'll be glad to see you. He's been asking for you all the time. Hello, Dad. I leave town for a month and find you in bed. Out in the rain without your rubbers, eh? Well, you look fine, Dad. Just fine. You'll probably be out ofhere in a week. Say, the fishing in Mexico, there's nothing like it. It's not really fishing, it's kind of big-game hunting. They have fish with teeth and horns. Throwback to the buffalo. You go out in a boat and fish charge at you. And you... And you just gotta catch 'em in self-defense. You and I and two machine guns... are going down there fishing next month. No more fishing for me, Johnny. What are you talking about? Why, Dr. Harvey says... You all right, Dad? Tell me about her. About her? The girl you're going to marry. Oh. Oh, she's wonderful. I met her at the Williams'. An old Boston family. Been in Mexico a number of years. We hit it off right away. I wanted to marry her the first week, but I... I thought I'd let you see her first. Why didn't you bring her? Well, I... I dropped her at the hotel. We brought her mother along too. I thought you'd be resting. The excitement. I want to see her. Yes, Dad. First thing in the morning. Now. Bring her to me. Just want to see her, that's all. You're going to get better, Dad. Hurry,Johnny. Go and get her. Go and get her. Sure, Dad. Sure. He looks awfully bad, Doctor. Better get the girl. But hurry. It may be a matter of minutes. Yes. My hat and coat, Roberts. Yes, sir. Miss Pennington, please. Miss Gloria Pennington. Yes, sir. Miss Gloria Pennington, please. 1220, please. Good evening, Mr. Duncan. Good evening. Let me talk to her. Did you order this weather? It hasn't been ideal, has it? Thank you. No. I'm sorry, sir. Miss Pennington doesn't answer. She doesn't answer? When does the Broadway Limited arrive, please? Information desk can tell you, madam. Thank you. Maybe she's in her mother's room. Would you try Mrs. Pennington? Yes, of course. Mrs. Pennington, please. Thank you. Please send this and charge it to my room. Straight wire or night letter? Could you wait just a minute? This call is awfully important. This telegram is important too. Send it straight wire. Thank you. Yes? I see. Is she in? I'm sorry. She doesn't answer either. I don't understand it. I left them here just a minute ago. Are their keys in the box? No, but people sometimes take them with them. Would you like me to have Miss Pennington paged? Oh, yes. Would you, please? I've got to find her. Yes, sir. Page Miss Gloria Pennington. Hurry, son, please. Do you have Mr. John Simms registered here? Maybe if you call her again? Just a moment. Paging Miss Pennington.! Just have a chair. We'll do our best to find Miss Pennington for you. Thank you. I'm awfully sorry. Miss Gloria Pennington.! Paging Miss Pennington.! Paging Miss Pennington.! Miss Gloria Pennington.! Paging Miss Pennington.! Check your coat, sir? Yes? What is it? Well, your coat, sir. Oh, no, no. I... I... Don't you think I'm right? 'Course you're right. Thirty-seven and 38. Thirty-seven and 38. What's the whole thing amount to? $40,000. Well, say it's $50,000. For a measly $50,000, you'd expect me to give up two weeks of my vacation? The government gets half of that anyway. All you'd be getting is $25,000... and sitting in a hot office for two weeks. They must think you're an idiot. This must be a new five-dollar coin. Looks like the same old dime to me, though. How's business? They're dime-ing us to death. Still raining? Buckets. Ahh! Is your tongue supposed to be white? Everybody's wearing it this season. I just figured out why drug stores have lunch counters. They lose money on food, but they make a big profit on bicarbonate of soda. Pardon me. Did you find her? No, sir. You didn't? Did you try everywhere? The beauty shop too? Yes, sir. Isn't there someplace else you can look? We'll do the best we can, sir. I'll call you the moment I... My dear, he's the handsomest doctor I've ever had. How marvelous.! He's simply priceless! He found everything the matter with me! How perfectly divine.! Miss.! I beg your pardon. Could you do me a tremendous favor? Huh? I'm in a bad spot. Could you help me? I've got to have something. No, I don't mean that! Yes. I've got to bring somebody home. I'll give you $50 if you'll only come! What? I know this is improper to talk to you, but... My father's dying. Can you help me? You don't understand. I work here. I only have an hour off. I'll have you back by then. I'll explain it to you later. Please, come. I'll give you anything! Just get in the car here. I'll help you with the umbrella. Here she is, Dad. This is my father. Hello. Can't see her. Raise the lamp. Take off your hat. Pretty. Sit here, child. I had to see you. I'd been worried what kind of a girl he'd marry. He's... He's had so many wrong 'uns, but I believe... he's picked the right one this time. I think he'll make you happy. My... MyJohnny's a good boy. He's a little weak, but honest. Never told me a lie. I... I spoiled him, of course. Don't you spoil him too. Keep an eye on him for me. Won't you? You promise me? We've had some beautiful women in our family. You should have seen his mother. You're going to fit in just fine. My, you're pretty. Oh, don't cry, dear. There's nothing to be sorry for. I had a good life. I didn't miss anything. And I've never been happier than I am right now. Please go now. He seems such a wonderful man. Yes, he is. You go along for years and take someone for granted. It never hits you that maybe someday... You can only think that if you had it to do over again, how much closer you could have been. It's a feeling everyone has. No, I'm sure I could have been a better son to him. I'm so sorry. There's a Miss Pennington on the phone for you, sir. Oh, excuse me. - Hello, Gloria. - Hello,John. Mother and I were out buying clothes. I'm sorry we had to pick just the time you called. My father wanted to see you. No, no, don't bother. It's a little too late. John, is he... Oh, thank heaven! Don't you want us to come? No, you try and rest. I'll call you in the morning. All right, darling. Be brave. Good-bye. He's sinking. Oh, yes. I want to thank you for what you did for me. That's all right. I wish I knew how to repay you. Well... Yes? Nothing. I'm glad I was able to help. Good-bye. Good-bye. Miss! I offered you money for this, didn't I? How much was it? Well, you said $50. You'll have to forgive me. I'm not thinking very clearly tonight. I really shouldn't take money for this. It just happens I can use it. I've been wanting to go back home. I haven't seen my folks for two years. Most of the money I make goes for my lessons, and... This'll do it. I can get the first train in the morning. Where are you from? Shelbyville, Ohio. I see. It was a very nice thing you did tonight. I want to thank you again. I... I appreciate this too. Oh, that's all right. Have you seen him? What happened? How is he? I'm from the New York Press. Is the old man... I mean, Mr. Reynolds... dead yet? I... I don't think so. I don't know. I... What? I'm hungry. Why,Jonathan, how do you feel? Hungry. Good morning, Dad. Hello,Johnny. Why, you look just fine. I want my breakfast. Uh, nurse! Nurse! Make a nice, thin slice of white toast. Put it in a bowl with two inches of lukewarm milk. Are you feeding the cat in here? Now,Jonathan. I want a steak. And a cigar. - Don't be hasty. - Who's hasty? I'm hungry! - But you're a very sick man. - Now, you just lie back and rest. In a minute, you're going to have a bowl of nice, warm toastie. I want some nice, hot steakie! - You can have some heavier foodsie later. - Quack. Where's Gloria? She's still at the hote... Oh. I- I-I don't know... where... where she... Well, call her. She can have breakfast with me. Breakfast. No, I don't think so. She's had a pretty long, uh,journey. She's, uh, probably still in the ba... Get her on the phone. I'll talk to her. No, that's not necessary. I'll... I'll, uh, get her while you're eating. Or maybe you'd rather see her later. I want to see her now. Want to see her now. Yes. Don't you think the strain of having h... Go and get her! Jonathan! Too much excitement! For heaven's sake, why don't you go? Certainly. I'm going! Don't get yourself upset, Dad. Then get her. I'll get her. I knew it. Why haven't you gone? Where am I going to go? To the hotel to get your fiance. She's not my fiance. I never saw her before in all my life. You... You never saw her before? I thought it was a matter of minutes. I wanted him to be happy. Oh, my. What am I going to do? I can't think. Let me see. What happened? I gave her the $50, and she said... What's a town in Ohio? Toledo. No, no. A small town! Small town! Starts with... Shh! Shelbyville! That's it! Thank you! Does that mean you can find her? There's a chance. Roberts, get my hat and coat, quick! Yes, sir. Pardon me, sir. How is the old gentleman? Well, he's hungry. He wants a steak. He's fine. Fine. Board! All aboard! Board! Well, here goes. Good-bye, darling. Good-bye,Jenny. Is these all yours? Uh-huh. Where's the yellow one? It's right here. I couldn't forget that. High yellow. That's my favorite color! Board.! Good-bye,Jackie. I'll write you every week. Thanks for the stationery from the hotel. Anne, you can't just walk out on yourself like this. She'll be back. No, I won't. It's not so easy to meet the Toscaninis and the Stokowskis. I've been trying for two years. Why, I couldn't even get to see the second doorman at the Met. It's going to be awfully dull in Shelbyville. There are eight million people in this city that don't care whether I ever sing another note in my life. In Shelbyville, there are only 2,000. The opposition isn't quite so strong there. You'd better come along now. Them seats is gettin'filled up. I'll be right in. Good-bye,Jackie,Jennie. Board.! Oh! Thank heavens! I was afraid you'd be gone! Where are your bags? Give me the lady's bags! What do you want? You can't do this! Leave those bags there. You've gotta go with me. It's my father. He's better! Give me the bags! Leave the bags there. I can't go! I'm going home! I quit my job! This ain't no time to arbitrate! I'll give you anything! Another $50! Ple... I don't want anything! Hey, wait! Don't go! Lady, I can't. That's out of my compartment. When the train goes, I ditto. Now will you throw 'em? Yes or no? Who's winnin'? All right, throw 'em! You is the most untravelin'est traveler I ever did see! Let me have 'em. How many are there? Uh, three. Three! Let me have 'em! And the big black one! The big black one! Throw the big... Oh! Aah! I've already sent a telegram home! Well, come on. We'll send another one from my house! He's been asking for you all morning.! We'll have to hurry.! Hey! What's going on here? This is Mr. Reynolds. How do you do? Come along. I'll give you another $50! I didn't know where to find you! I remembered Shelbyville... Well, what do you know? Don't worry,Jennie. It's platonic. He wants her for his father. His fa... fo... Try not to talk. That's the important thing. If you don't say anything, you can't get tripped up. Understand? I won't speak unless I'm spoken to. That's the ticket. A Miss Pennington has telephoned several times while you were out, sir. Miss Penni... Excuse me! Oh! When she calls again, tell her I'll call her as soon as I can. Let's go over it once more. How long have you lived in Mexico? Five years. Parents? Just a mother. Left for Boston. To see? Relatives. Remember, try not to talk. I may have to answer something. If he asks you a question you're not sure of,just smile... like this. You can smile your way out of anything. That's fine. Ready? Shoot. Oh. Yes, indeed. My blessings to you both. Well, thank you. Hello, Bishop. Good morning, son. This is Bishop Maxwell. And this is... How do you do? How do you do. Have you had your breakfast? Yes, she has. Yes, thank you. Wouldn't like a nice little steak sent up here, would you? - No, thank you. - You could eat it when everyone's gone. She said no. And she wouldn't care for a nice cigar either... which she could smoke when everyone's gone. It won't do,Jonathan. Keep an eye on him, Bishop. I'll be right back. Wonder if that ol' witch doctor has a medical diploma. I bet he hasn't. How did you find Mexico? Wonderful country, isn't it? Yes. Yes, it is. Yes, I was there quite a while myself. Almost two years. Really? Charming language. Se dice que los Espanoles tienen un proverbio. El idioma Aleman es para los caballos, el Frances para los hombres... y el Espanol para los mujeres. Yo digo ques los Espanoles estan en lo cierto. No es asi? Now, Bishop. Excuse me, my dear. That's what they say. Gloria, I want you to do something for me. Go to those columns. Gloria! Yes? Ye... Oh. Yes. Uh, do you see those columns over there? These? Go to them. In the middle there. Underneath the panel. What, this? Yes. Press it with your fingers as you push it in. Oh! There's a little silver knob in the middle there. This one? Yes, with the numbers. Turn it to the left to number 18. Dad, this is... Left to 18. This is hardly the time. I have 18. Now 12 to the right. Twelve to the right. Dad, this is a family vault. This is hardly the time to tell the combination. Don't be silly. I'm sorry, I... I have that. Now take hold of the handle and push it down. Pull it open. Look inside. Dad. - See a large black box? - This one? Now take it out. Bring it to me. Dad, I'm serious. I mean it. I wouldn't do this if I were you. The familyjewels. They're so... If it would put everyone at ease, I could step outside. What's the matter with you? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean you. I didn't mean you either, Bishop. Well! That woman's been with Dr. Harvey for years. Well, you can't be too careful. Open it. They were my mother's, then my wife's. Now they're yours. Oh, they're beautiful. I've never seen anything like them. You must hand them down to your daughter or your son's wife. Do you promise me? May I take them out? No. We've all seen them. Let's put them back in the safe. What are you worried about? Are you planning to wear them yourself? Well, I must be going. I'll be disappointed if I don't see you in your pew for the Easter services. I'll be there. Johnny, see the bishop out. Johnny! Yes! Oh. I hope you don't wait for a June wedding. Confidentially, I like to go camping in June. Yes, she certainly is. Doctor, would you mind keeping an eye on Dad? Certainly. There's nothing like a nice spring wedding. Marry in spring and the angels sing. I always say that too. - Well, good-bye, young lady. - Good-bye, Bishop. What do you want? Open your mouth. May I put it on? Of course you can. A most attractive young lady,John. A most attractive young lady. Yes, she is, isn't she? I've married a lot of beautiful women in my day... speaking professionally, of course. But I've never seen a bride as lovely as she's going to be. Oh, thank you. What dates have we open for the church, Henry? Oh, there isn't any hurry. There's the morning of the 1 Oth and the afternoon of the 13th. Perhaps the 13th. Are you superstitious, John? Oh, yes, I certainly am. Your fiance's on the phone again. It's rather urgent, sir. Oh. Tell Mr. Fiancee I'll call him back in a little while. You didn't understand, sir. It's Miss Pennington, your fiance. Uh, I'll... I'll be right there. Very well, sir. Oh. I can explain this. Uh, I, uh... It's a long story, but... You're not obliged to explain your actions to anyone. You don't understand. You see, this isn't my girl. My girl is, uh... You see, my father was... Come along, Henry. Please, Bishop, I can explain this. I... Son, I'm disappointed in you. Gloria. I wanted to call you back. I'm sorry, but I couldn't. I'm sorry. You don't have to explain. I understand. I should be with you at a time like this. I'm coming right over. No! No! I mean, no. There's no need. It's very considerate, but it'd be more convenient if I come over to the hotel. Yes, I'll... Right awa... Yes. Fine. Good-bye. You might apologize to the nurse. I told her you were a little overwrought. A little overwrought? I'm going crazy. You know what the bishop thinks? He's known me since I was a baby. Any minute Gloria might pop in with that girl up there with that necklace. What happened to that necklace? It was put back in the safe. This is too much. I can't stand it. I'm gonna put a stop to it. I'm gonna make a clean breast of it right now! You'll do no such thing. You want your father to live, don't you? I don't know what's kept him going, but he's not going to have a shock if I can help it. Oh, I'm sorry. I... I'll think of something to tell Gloria. I'll... Tell her the truth. What kind of a girl is she? That's it. That's it. I'll tell her the truth. She's a fine girl! Six. Seven. Eight. That was seven. That was eight. I can count just dandy. Let's not argue about it. I'll start all over again. Oh, no you don't. We agreed on 10 puffs, and 10 puffs are all you're going to get. Are you calling me a liar for one puff? Yes, I am. And take that cigar out or I'll count it as a puff. You've got two more puffs coming and you better hurry up before the doctor gets back. I'll make you a proposition. Instead of the last two puffs, I'll just keep the cigar in my mouth. Not interested. I won't inhale. Nope. Nothing doing. Look, I... Jonathan, these wires are touching, and from such important people. Everybody in the world seems to be concerned about you. They've been coming in like this all day. Thirty-five in the last hour. Think of that. I'll read them later. Oh, now you're being modest. Not every invalid... How do you do. Not every invalid gets a wire from the White House. You ought to have that framed. Go have it framed, will you? Now! Yes, I will. Here's one from Walter Winchell, the journalist. And Jascha Heifetz, the musician. And here's one from... I smell something. Do you? No, I don't think so. I don't, either. It's a very distinct odor. Oh, yes. It's the oil furnace. The fumes come up from the ventilator. You should have that corrected. Run down and tell them to have it fixed, will you? I most certainly will. That's not good for you. Here's a long wire from Leopold Stokowski. He'll be in town the day after tomorrow and wants to visit. We'll see about that. I wish you'd go out and have that furnace fixed. The fumes are killing me. Is it that bad? Of course I will. I... What's that? That's steam. I've got hot feet. Very peculiar symptom. "Fumes from the oil furnace. " How old are you, two years? You behave like a baby. No use trying to tell you to do anything. Hey! That's a two-dollar cigar! Where did you get it? Don't look at me. I smoke a pipe. Bishop gave it to me. Very funny. Fine thing for a two-dollar cigar. Where are the rest of them? I haven't got any. There aren't any more. Oh. Trouble with being sick is you've got to associate with doctors. Thank you very much, my dear. That fellow goes around behaving that way. Stokowski's a friend of yours? Who? Stokowski. Oh, I know him. We don't agree on Brahms. You talk to him? Not about Brahms. And he... he really comes here? Oh, yes. He eats here when he's in town. Two-dollar cigar. He does? I'd like to meet him sometime. Do you suppose I could? I... I've always admired him. My dear, well, that's simple. We must ask him here to dinner some night. Ask all my friends to dinner if that cigar thief... You won't be having anyone over. You're still too weak. If you don't start paying attention to what I say... Oh, go and smoke my cigars. Could I sing for him? Who, Stokowski? Oh, no. Oh, but I've studied music. I've no doubt you have, my dear, but Stokowski comes here for pleasure. It'd be a pleasure. You want me to prove it? I'll take your word for it. Have you a piano? No. It needs tuning, anyway. Where is it? I don't remember. Could you hear it from here? It's much too far. It's downstairs. Maybe if we leave the door open. Uh, please. I am a sick man. I... Please. Now, don't get excited. Leave these open, please. Would you boys mind giving me a hand? - I beg your pardon? - I want to move this piano. It's for Mr. Reynolds. He must be delirious. Uh, straight ahead. Right over there, please. This isn't exactly our field of endeavor. I hope the union doesn't get wind of this. Just swing that end around there, please. I want to be sure he can hear me. Closer to the stairs. Uh-huh. That's fine. The bench is in there. Would you mind, please? Would you mind holding this and this? Fine. Then I can open the piano. Are you going to play something sad? Oh, no, I'm going to play something loud. That's fine, boys. Thank you. If I can do anything for you... Just go ahead with what you're doing.  - Can you hear me? - No.! No.  How was that? Go ahead.! Break every chandelier in the house.! When I sing  The cares of the day are far away  My heart seems  As light as the song I hear from some happy nightingale  When I sing  My world is a place that's bright and gay  Rain turns to sunshine  December to may    Life is divine  When I sing    My gray days are gay days  When I tra-la-la for a while  There's laughter in music  And each little note is a smile   The music is part of the joy in my heart    When I sing  The cares of the day are far away  My heart seems  As light as the song I hear from some happy nightingale  When I sing  My world is a place that's bright and gay  Rain turns to sunshine  December to may  Who are they? - When I sing...  - They're from the national museum. What did they want? They came to make the death mask. Whose? The old man's. ... Bright as the song I hear...  Jonathan! What are you do... How did you get... Shh! You... You get right back to bed! You can't do this to me. I'm not a young man! You made her stop. You get back to bed! Where are the nurses? Any nurse. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean... I'm sorry, my dear. I apologize. You can sing to anybody, and you will just as soon as I'm up and about. Yes. Mr. Reynolds! How did he get out? Look what he's doing. Leave me alone! Get him back to bed. If I ever live through this case, I'm going to retire. I swear I will. But who is the girl? You must know something about her. I don't even know her name. I tell you, I found her on the street. On the street? And your father thinks that's Gloria? Please understand, this is just temporary... only for a few days. Suppose he doesn't die in a few days? Well, I wasn't thinking about that. We'll have to wait until he's stronger. And when it won't be too much of a shock, we'll let him meet Gloria. Shock? You can hardly call Gloria a shock! Oh, of c... I didn... I wasn't, uh... Mother, please. Johnny's doing everything he can. Yes? Yes? Yes? What's that? Your mourning clothes, madam. I hope they're not too late. Oh, please, take them away. We don't want them. No one ever wants them. Fate forces them upon us. Please take them away. I'll send you a check. We don't need them now. I'm sorry to hear that. I mean I'm happy to hear that. - Take them away! We don't want them. - Certainly. Confusing, isn't it? Yes, very. You have our phone number in case, uh... You see, as soon as father's up and around, you'll come over, get acquainted, and we'll... I refuse to let Gloria set foot in your house until that girl is gone. Don't worry about that. I'll get rid of her. I'll figure out something. Of course you will. You're a real darling. A honey lamb darling. I've been tampered with. Look at this. Used to have the finest waistline in town. Biggest, anyway. I've been robbed. A few steaks will soon fix this up. A few steaks, medium rare. Like lamb chops too. Can't do this to me. Ha! That's incredible! Oh. Anybody here? Nobody here. It's just the clock. It scared me. Silly. It was nothing. Mr. Reynolds! Sir,you're downstairs? Don't scare me like that, Roberts. Where's the doctor? He wasn't feeling well, sir. A touch of nervous indigestion. I believe he stopped off at the doctor's. Good. He'll be here any minute. If I were you, I'd... Hmm? Why,Jonathan, what are you doing here? How did you get downstairs? I slid down the bannisters. You know you shouldn't do... Where's your nurse? I've been looking for her all over the place. Where were you? I had to stop by. I've been having a little trouble. Trouble? I haven't been feeling so... What's this? What's what? That's Roberts, my butler. What's that he's got in his mouth? Hmm? Why, if it isn't a cigar. What do you mean, smoking in my presence? How dare you! Cut it out! You know he's not smoking that cigar of his own free will. Isn't he? Oh, I'm sorry, Roberts. I forgot. I asked him to smoke. I like the, uh, aroma. He smokes 'em, I smell 'em. Any objections? No, but... You can go now, Roberts, and remember, whenever I'm around, you're to smoke. Very good, sir. Here you are! This isn't exactly where you told me you were going. He kept me waiting up there 20 minutes... before I discovered the bathroom had another door. Why, Dad, it's great to see you up. Come along now,Jonathan. Quit shoving! Where's Gloria? Uh, Gloria? I'm gonna pick her up in a few minutes, Dad. I've never seen anybody so excited about anything in all my life. E- E-Excited? What's she excited about? I'm giving her a party. You're giving Gloria a pa... a party? She wants to meet all my musical friends and sing for 'em. She's going to, Saturday night. You must go back to your room now. Not yet. I've got to make a phone call. That's what you said the last time. Don't you think Saturday night's a little too soon? Yes. Don't you? Can't call it off. Everything's been started. It's too late. Besides, I want New York to meet the girl you're going to marry. Wonder where I can get hold of Heifetz? This time I'm going with you! Leave me alone! Enough's enough. Too much. He's seen that girl for the last time. By Saturday she'll be back in Iowa or wherever she comes from. Kentucky. Ohio. What's the difference? I'll pay her off right now. What are you going to tell him? You figure out something. Me? You're in this as much as I am. But I'm a sick man. I'm a very sick man.   She sings like a thrush. From Ireland. Stop already.! All night long I am pushing the wagon! Peanuts! Popcorn! All day long I'm hearing: La-la-la-la  Shut up! Is this a free country? Then I got to sleep! If I lay my hands on you, you'll sleep for a month! Stop yellin'! Who's yelling? Who's yelling? Everybody she's yelling! Is anything the matter? No, dearie, nothing at all. It's just Mr. Popalardi. He's drunk again. Drunk? I'm drunk? Ha, ha, ha, ha! Go back to your practicing. Remember, Saturday's only the day after tomorrow. You wouldn't want those important people to be disappointed in your singin'. Go on with ya now. All right. I'll be sendin' ya up a nice hot cup of coffee in a minute, dearie. Thank you. It's wonderful the way those people are pulling for me. They want you to kill 'em Saturday night, honey. And you will too. Just wait 'til they see you in that new gown. You won't even have to sing good. When do you get it? Tomorrow morning. I'll bet he'll like it too. Who? He isn't exactly blind. I used to go steady with an engaged fellow. It was very romantic. He was awfully nice to both of us. What are you talking about? I was just telling you about the fellow I used to go with. Turned out he was fickle. He married his fiance. Are you out of your mind? He's engaged. I know.! So was this guy. That's what all the trouble was about! Now, look,Jackie... You don't have to... Come in. Hello. Oh, hello. I wasn't expecting you. You rememberJackie, don't you? - Of course. - The station. Oh, yes, yes, certainly. Ah, if you'll excuse me, I'll, uh... Won't you sit down? Oh, yes, yes, I can only stay for just a minute. Whoops! Oh, I'm sorry. I meant that chair. Here, let me help you. I'll get it. Don't worry. No,just stand still. I'm sorry. You got it. Just a second now. I'll get it. Pull, don't... You sat in our gymnasium. Your gymnasium? See? I read somewhere that a disadvantage is nothing but an opportunity for improvement. And this place is just full of opportunities. You have a very nice room. It's, uh... It's different. Uh-huh. On a clear day you can see all the way across it. I'd better get ready now. The chauffeur usually picks me up a little later. I can be dressed in just two minutes. That's not necessary. I mean, to get dressed. No? No, that's why I'm here. You don't have to come to the house anymore. You're free to go home. Today, if you like. I brought your check. You can look it over if you want to. I think it's all there, though. I could stay on another few days, until the end of the week maybe? That's not necessary. Father's gonna be all right, thanks to you. I hope this repays you a little. This going away is so sudden. The shock for your father. I mean, aren't you afraid... I thought of that. I have a solution. I'm gonna tell him that you and I quarreled. You broke our engagement. I'll tell him tonight. Then I'll introduce Gloria to him as a friend of Dr. Harvey's. He'll get to know her and in time it'll become more or less, you see... I see. Well, I want you to know how grateful I am and, uh, thanks again. I... Thanks. Look... H- He was giving me a party Saturday night so some people could hear me sing. Would you let me come to that? How? Couldn't you ask Gloria to wait just a few more days? And introduce you to our friends Saturday night as my fiance? You don't really think that could happen. They could think I was an entertainer. I've been planning so much on this party. I'd really do anything... Now, now, let's be more practical. I'm sure you can get people with musical connections to hear you sing. That's not as easy as you think. I don't know anybody with musical connections. I know a few. I could write some letters if you can really sing. I can sing, all right, but they don't... If I could hear you sometime, I might be able to do all I can. You can hear me now, if you want to. Yes, all right. Is there anything you like especially? Ah, no,just whatever you have there is all right. Well, here's a little Spanish song. It's nice... very, very short.  Holy mackerel! It's almost noon and I promised to take Gloria and her mother to lunch.! I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll, uh, write you. We'll get something done. Thank you very much again. Good-bye. It's hard to believe. It was hard for me to believe too. I thought she was crazy about me. What a temper! Wow! She seemed such a nice girl, so mild and gentle. Mild and gentle! See this mark? That's where she hit me with her handbag and for nothing too. I'm all broken up, Dad. All broken up. I guess it's all for the best. I'm young. I'll fall in love again. Sooner than I think. Then this will only be a bitter memory. That's life. - I say, that's life. - What? Oh, yes. I wonder why she didn't call me up before she left. I thought she liked me. Dad, you were so anxious to like a fiance of mine, that you gave yourself the wrong impression. She liked me. Dad, I didn't want to tell you this, but do you know what she called you? What? You won't think too badly of her? What did she call me? A pompous, self-indulgent, overbearing imitation of a dictator. Did she say that? And she said I took after you. She did? Pompous, overbearing. Tch, tch, tch. Oh, this must be Dr. Harvey. He's bringing along two friends. Mother and daughter, old friends. Wonderful people. I don't want to meet any people. But these people are charming, he says. Oh, forgive me,Johnny, if you can. I'm such a silly girl. I'm spoiled. It's my temper. I don't deserve any happiness. You shouldn't take me back. - There's no need for tears. - It'll never happen again. I was just upset. I picked a quarrel and he acted like a lamb, a perfect lamb. Oh,Johnny, please say you'll forgive me. Please! Well, say something. All right, I will. I'll say something. This girl... This girl is not... For heaven's sake, say you'll forgive her! Mr. Reynolds! Your condition! Dad, don't get excited! Say it! All right! I forgive her! That's better. Dad, you all right? Yes! Yes, yes, yes. Don't you think you'd better lie down? Go away! I like a girl with spirit. To tell you the truth, I thought you were wishy-washy. Yes, I did. To have the courage to ask for forgiveness is a great quali... What was it you called me? Pompous? Self-indulgent? "Imitation of a dictator. " It's true. It's me all over. And you'll do well to correct those faults in yourself, me boy! If you don't watch out, you'll grow up to bejust like me. Been meaning to warn you about that for years. Go on, make it up with him. Kiss him. Kiss him? Of course, you know why lovers quarrel, don't you? Simple. Fun of making it up. Aaah! Aaah.! Aah.! Mm. Ow, my... Aaah! Let me up. Let me go. Aah! Now,Johnny, let me up. Now, please... Johnny! Ha-ha. Johnny. Please, don't do that,Johnny. Do what? This? Aah! Stop it! Let me up,Johnny! Please let me go! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Don't! Johnny let me go.! Stop it.! Johnny.! Please.! Please, let me go.! Stop it.! Johnny.! Stop it.! Johnny.! Please,John... Please,John... Cigar? I'll help you find one. Don't bother, dear. It's no bother at all. He said, " Don't bother, dear. " Aaah! Going around pinching people, at your age. When I get about three seconds older, I'm gonna start punching people. You dirty little... Come here! Hey! Come here.! Say.! Hey.! Oh.! Are you hurt? Let me go! Oh, no, you don't! Hey, come here. I told you I wanted to sing Saturday night and I'm going to. Over my dead body. I'll tell your father the truth after Saturday night. I'd tell him right now if I wasn't afraid the shock would kill him. After the party I'll disappear, I promise and then you can have Gloria for good. That'll be great after you've been introduced to half of New York as my fiance. All I want is this one chance. If I could only get my hands on... You hear something snap, don't turn around. It'll be your neck. You have to catch me first.  Who's coming Saturday? Huh? I said, who'll be here Saturday night? Who'll be here? Oh, everybody, everybody. Stokowski? Oh,yes, yes, of course. Heifetz too? There's a guest list in my desk in the library if you'd care to look it over. This is the song I'm going to sing. Wanna hear it? I'd love to.  Clavelitos a quien le doy claveles  Clavelitos para los churumbeles  Clavelitos que los doy con los ojos cerraos  Y los traigo en el cesto a precio modesto rojos y pintaos  Clavelitos de la tierra adorada  Clavelitos que vienen de Granada  Clavelitos que los traigo yo aqui para ti  Yque tienen la esencia presencia y potencia que tienen pa mi  Clavelitos  Que los traigo bonitos  Pa mi novio los traigo  Porque tienen pa robar corazones ole y ensenarles  Esencia presencia y potencia que ya sabe usted, si tu me quieres  Mi nino, carino,yo te dare un clavelito yo y veras que bien  Si estamos juntos en un rinconcito si tu me quieres sera no del alma  Si te quiero mas a ti y todos las clavelitos bonitos  Todos seran para ti Todos son para ti  Para ti, para ti, para ti  Jonathan, I want you to meet two old friends of mine, Mrs. Smith and her daughter, Miss Smith. How do you do? How do you do? How do you do? Won't you sit down, Mrs., uh... Smith. Smith. Won't you sit down? Uh, no, thank you, we just stopped in to say hello. Hello. Oh, well, oh, uh, um... C- Can't you stay for just a minute? Oh, no. We're in a dreadful hurry, really. Oh, I... I beg your pardon. This is Miss Gloria Pennington, my son's fiance. How do you do? Oh, I'm sorry, we can't stay. We're on our way to... to, uh... To a horse show. Horse show at this time of the year? Where? Yes. Uh... Dr. Harvey hasn't told us. Where is it? Huh? Oh, oh, it's a private horse show at a friend's house. Afraid I couldn't offer you anything as entertaining as that. My daughter simply adores horses. So nice to have seen all of you. Come, Mother. Yes, dear. We've had a nice visit. At it again, huh? Good-bye. Excuse me. I'll see them to their car. Gloria, I had nothing to do with this. That girl forced me into it. Have you a handkerchief? Handkerchief? Yes. But don't cry, dear. I won't. Glor... Glo... Well, good night, my dear. Good night. Good night. Think I'll go to bed. Good night,Johnny. Good night, Dad. Fine,just fine, the way you handle things. Your wrap, miss? Hmm? Oh, please. Yes, come in. I... I wonder if I could talk to you for a few minutes. Of course, my dear. What is it? Well, I, uh... I'll ring for you when I need you, Roberts. Very well, sir. Excuse me. Sit down, my dear. Is anything troubling you? Well, yes. You see... I don't know how to begin. Is it as difficult as that? It's about... Before you start, would you mind getting me one of those pills? On the table. Over there. That's right, the little yellow bottle. These? Yes. I'd better take one. - Aren't you feeling well? - Does bother me a little bit. But I've got to expect it, though, at my time of life. Would you get me a glass of water, dear? Water? Yes. There's the pitcher. Must have been those friends of Dr. Harvey's. I expect he'd have friends like that. Thank you. Better? Oh, oh, yes. I'm quite all right. Nothing to worry... It's only the fire. Huh? Oh, oh. The least excitement brings it on. I'm always afraid they'll put me back in that overstuffed straight jacket. You'll be all right, I'm sure. Few more days with you and I will be. What are you going to wear for the party? The party? Have you got your dress? Yes, but... What color is it? Black. I think I'd better be going. We'd be the handsomest couple there if I hadn't lost my waistline. This is ridiculous. Good night, dear. Good night. Good night. Good night, my dear. It is my firm conviction Mrs. Pennington is a medical freak. I was watching her, and no normal person can talk as long as she does without taking a breath. For a second I thought you weren't going to calm them down. You were almost an ex-fiance. Yeah, it was pretty close... Where have you been? You might go up. He could be feeling better. You don't mean... He... What have you been up to? I haven't been up to anything. You did something up there. I tried, but I couldn't. What did you try to do? I... I tried to tell him the truth. But I didn't have the heart. Must be some other way. You do admit you put me in a terrible spot. Oh, yes. Yes, I do. If I had my life to live over, I wouldn't have been so selfish. Oh, I can understand what prompted you. Is, uh... Is everything all right now between you and Miss Pennington? Yes, she finally forgave me. She's acting wonderfully. She is... It's been tough on her. I don't blame her... much. It's her mother. Do you think there's anything to heredity? I... I wouldn't know about that. Dr. Harvey says her mother is a medical freak. I believe him. They haven't been able to prove definitely that people inherit traits from their parents. They have with horses. Yes, I know about the horses. Oh. Marvelous the way they do that. Yes, it is. This surely has been funny. I bring you here by accident and my father likes you so much. We can't tell him the truth. He'd have liked anybody you brought. Oh, no, he wouldn't. You should have seen the looks he gave some I brought home. Did... Did you bring home a great many? I mean,just as friends, you know. Oh. He certainly does like you. I like him too. Hmm? Well, we better think up a plan to get me out of the party. Oh, yes. Now, let me see. Yes. Let's see, uh...  - Bad. - Pardon? Needs more bounce. Bounce? Bubbles. Ever listen to champagne?  You see? I see.  That's better. Remember what you're playing at 11:00. I won't forget. The minute I make the announcement, play something loud. Yes, sir. A couple of my guests may need reviving. Here you are, sir. Hmm? Has Dr. Harvey hidden my cigars from me? He has, sir. Have you hidden them from Dr. Harvey? I have, sir. Good. What is the matter? Too much paprika. Too much? This much. I, Armand... Calmez vous, Armand, quandje dis trop de paprika. Monsieur Reynolds, insulter mon cuisine c'est m'insulter moi, Armand. What's that? Roast beef Napoleon. Ah! Delicieux.! Not bad. Jonathan? I thought I'd find you here, Jonathan. How do you feel, Dad? How do I know? Ask him. I have a very pleasant surprise for you. How long will you be gone? No, I mean I have some friends coming over. Do you remember the two ladies you met? No, I'm sorry, I don't. Why,Jonathan, the two ladies you met... Pardon,you're wanted on the telephone. Can't be bothered. It might be important, Dad. Who is it? - Miss Pennington, sir. - What does she want? I don't know, sir. Why don't you ask her? Ah. Very dependable young lady. Very. How are you,Jonathan? My, it's nice to see you up and around again. Hello,Johnny! Hello,Johnny! Johnny, how are you? Hello,Johnny. What's wrong? I... I have a splitting headache. It came on suddenly. I'm... very sorry. I can't come to the party. You can't? That's not very good news, you know. The party will be no party without you. I could send the car over. Perhaps in a little while you'll be feeling better. Dad, I wouldn't force her if she, uh... I mean... What's that? Well, I see. Would you like me to come over there? Oh, no, no, she doesn't. Oh, no, no, don't do that. It's not necessary. I'd rather be alone, really. It's only fair. When I was ill you came to me. It's the least I can do. Jonathan, you know you can't leave this house. Go away. That was that doctor. You're at the St. Charles? What's your room number? She doesn't... My room num... Oh, I'm not at the hotel. I'm with some friends. They'll see that I'm all right. Where do they live? Dad, really, you shouldn't. Please, let me... Let me alone. I can be there in 15 minutes. Jonathan, I forbid it. Dad, you're having a party. The guests are here. Go away. Get out! What's that address, dear? I can be there in five minutes. Or don't you want to see me? No, I don't. I don't wanna see you. I don't ever wanna see you again, you understand? I don't ever wanna see you again! That's all! Dad, I'm sure she didn't mean to be rude. It... It's just that she isn't feeling well and she's probably... probably more or less a little nervous. Why,you're the picture ofhealth, Jonathan. Awfully nice to see you around again. How are you, Mr. Reynolds? Positively streamlined. I wish I knew how you did it. Look at me! Yes, look at him! How are you,John? How are you? Hello,Johnny? Penny, how are you? How are you, dear? Darling, how are you? Oh, Myra. Fine, thank you. Awfully glad to see you. Oh, excuse me just a moment. Hello,John. Hello, Gloria. Hello. Good evening. It's all set. She just phoned. She isn't coming. Good. At last I can be Mrs. Pennington. Where's the rest of the family? Hello. He's right in there somewhere. Well, shall we go in? Of course, heaven knows we waited long enough for this. You haven't said a word about how I look. Oh, you look fine. Just beautiful. New dress, huh? Well, shall we? At first,just talk to him. Warm him up. Hello,Johnny. Hello there. Remember the music... Brahms. He hates it. There's only one thing I want to discuss with him. Where's Dad? In the living room, I think. Good evening, Doctor. Don't forget, we're no longer the Smiths. Where's your father, John? Isn't he in there? No, I just came from there. Excuse me. I'll get him. Looking for someone, Johnny? Yes, I was looking for Dad. Looking for him myself. Understand he's lost 60 pounds. Yes, he has. How does he feel? Oh, he feels fine. Excuse me just a moment. Oh, I'll get him. Just a minute. What's wrong? I can't find him. Why, I distinctly saw him go into the living room. Maybe he's upstairs. Is Mr. Reynolds up there, Simmons? No, sir, haven't seen him. You haven't seen him. He was in full view not five minutes ago. Where's your father, Johnny? Roberts! I can't find my father. Where is he? I have no idea, sir. Cocktails, madam? No, thank you. Uh, this way? Yes, sir. The first door to your left. Come in. Set it down anywhere and dust it off. Give it to me. Oh! - Dust what off? - I thought you were the... We asked a man downstairs to bring the trunk up. May I sit down? Yes, of course. Oh! No! Not there. That chair bites. That's our gymnasium. You can sit here. This is very comfortable. Who are you? Who are you? I'm Jonathan Reynolds. I'm Jackie Donovan. How do you do? How do you do? Oh! Jonathan Reynolds? Well, I have to go to work now. I'll see ya at the station, Anne... unless he can talk some sense into you! So you never want to see me again, hmm? Why did you come? I was afraid you meant what you said on the phone. It seems I was right. Are you leaving? Tonight, 11:30. Well, it isn't a very nice way... for old friends to part, is it? We are old friends, aren't we? Yes. But you were gonna go away without even saying good-bye. They'll be missing you at the party. Don't you think you should go back? I'm terribly fond of you, you know. Terribly fond. You don't mind my saying that, do you? When you're as old as I am, you haven't got much time left to waste... and you just say things right out. Anne Terry. That is your name, isn't it? Anne Terry, Anne Terry. I like it better. How long have you known? Oh, a few days, but that's not important now. Without even saying good-bye.  Sing that for me. I can't now. Not even that? What have I done to you? Goin' home  I'm a-goin' home  Quiet like  Some still day  I'm just goin'home  It's not far  Just close by  Through an open  Door Work all done  Care laid by  Goin' to grieve  No more  Mother's there  Expectin' me  Father's waitin'...  Is this the dress? Yes. Pretty. And this little fur? Well, that... that's not mine. We borrowed it. We were to be the handsomest couple there, remember? You could catch a train in the morning. Oh, no, I can't go to the party. I promised. Oh, no, I didn't mean the party. We two should go out together somewhere and say good-bye properly, hmm? People would recognize you and that wouldn't be fair. I know of a nice quiet place where no one knows me. Where no one knows you? Good evening, Mr. Reynolds. How are you, Mr. Reynolds? Why,Jonathan Reynolds! Lost a little weight, haven't you? Yes, this is ridiculous, isn't it? Here's your check, Mr. Reynolds. Thank you very much. Nice quiet place where no one knows you, hmm? I've never been here before. Must have seen my picture in the paper. Nice having you with us again. Right this way, Mr. Reynolds. Oh, I forgot. Excuse me, please. Thomas! Yes, sir? I forgot to tell my son where I was going. Would you call him, please? Certainly, sir. And tell him I mightn't be here long in case he wants to join me. Very good, sir. This way, please. I am so sorry. I do apologize. I had to see that man over there... Good evening,Jonathan. How do you do? That's Jonathan Reynolds. Is he still alive? Here we are. Charles. Coming. Your wrap? No, thank you. For Mr. Reynolds, a Reynolds Special. For madam? Nothing, thank you. We'll order dinner later. Very good, sir. We haven't seen you in a long time, Mr. Reynolds. How nice of you to save one of those for me. Thank you. Won't you tell me why you brought me here? It's a nice place, music and dancing. And everyone knows you. Well, yes. People see you here with me, they tell other people. It helps you out. It helps what? You want a career, don't you? There are people here who can open the doors for you. Not if you go to them yourself, of course. But you're seen with me... I support the opera. Makes a difference. Hold it, will ya, Mr. Reynolds? Thank you. Thank you. That helps too, you know. Tomorrow morning that will be in the papers... I... I do wish you wouldn't let him use that picture. Why not? It's not fair. To whom? Well, to, uh... Please try and stop him. Don't let him use it. Tell him to destroy it. I'll do what I can. Oh, please try, won't you? I... If you'll excuse me... Mister? Oh, yes, Mr. Reynolds. The young lady with me is Miss Anne Terry, my son's fiance. Thank you, Mr. Reynolds. T- E-R-R-Y. Thank you, Mr. Reynolds. Oh, Thomas? Yes, sir? Did you reach my son? Yes, sir, he said he'd be right over. He seemed rather upset, sir. Very good. He's going to destroy the picture. Oh, thank you. Would you mind asking for the check now, please? I don't understand you. I thought you wanted a career. This is the least I can do for you. I know, but I... Would you bring the check now, please? Certainly, madam. Thank you. What's that? It's a Reynolds Special. But you shouldn't be dri... What's in it? Oh, it's, uh, nothing but... coconut milk and vegetable juices. Dr. Harvey orders it for me. It's... It's horrible. Then why do you drink it? Because it reminds me of Dr. Harvey and it makes me hate him... and when I hate him I feel good. There isn't any, um... Oh, no, no, no. Let me taste it. Oh, that's awful. Do you order this often? Always. Have to. It's warm in here, isn't it? I think I'd better take this off. It's so warm. Isn't it silly? It makes my eyes water. Now, now, now, now. What's this? You are in love with my son, aren't you? Sorry. May I have a handkerchief, please? Yes, of course. Oh! That's... That's a lamb chop I stole at the party. Stop laughing at me. Let me see. Your check, sir. You've forgotten to charge for the lamb chop. Pardon me, sir? The lamb chop. I brought you this? You don't suppose I brought it myself, do you? Oh, no, no, Mr. Reynolds. But I wouldn't serve a lamb chop in an ashtray. I was a little surprised myself. But I assure you... Now look here, I intend to pay for everything I get. So will you please put this on the bill? Yes, sir. Yes, Mr. Reynolds. Shall we... Shall we dance before the check comes? All right.  What's this? Oh, the conga. It's very simple. Two, three, kick. One, two, three, kick. Come on, try it. Kick, one, two, three, kick. One, two, three, kick. One, two, three, kick. Come on. Wonderful. One, two, three, kick. One, two, three, kick. Oh, look at the old man!  And three weeks ago they gave him up for dead! Ooo! Ooo! Ooo! Ooo! Ooo! Ooo! Where is he, Tom? Well, he, uh... Dad! Dad! Dad, stop! For heaven sake! Jonathan, you can't do this to me. I'm not a young man. This is terrible. Leave me alone. It's wonderful. How did you get here? Come on! Hey! Where are you going? Jonathan! Don't go! Jonathan, you're going with me. I'm going to put you to bed. Oh, go to bed yourself. Jonathan. Jonathan! I just want to make sure you don't do anything else for me. You've done enough already. I beg your pardon. You talk my father into coming here, then you get him out there acting like a 10-year-old, hmm? Then you have somebody phone me to break up the party. All after you promised to fix things up! You fixed them up all right! Get out... You come home with me.! I'm going to put you to bed! Where did she go? What did you let her go for? Jonathan, come along. Aboard.! Excuse me. All aboard.! Where's the little yellow one? Hey, wait! Anne, listen to me! You can't go! Give me those bags. Who says I can't go? Leave those bags there. Haven't you caused enough trouble? It's Father! It's probably the end this time. Please, you've got to come. He needs you! Give me the bags! Give them to him. Last night was too much for him. I know it's... Oh! The little yellow one! The little yellow one! Hurry up, get the little yellow one. Is that all? Which one? The black one! Lady, the next time you ain't goin' no place, why don't you try a plane? How is he, nurse? He's very low. There is a chance, isn't there? We've given him an injection. He may pull through. We'd better go right on up. Don't you want to see your father first? My father? Who's up there? Why, Dr. Harvey. - Where's Mr. Reynolds? - I'm here. We make a very handsome couple. Who? You and I. Why, you old... Do you know what... You should have seen the doctor when he found out I was faking. He fluttered to the floor like an autumn leaf. Wonderful. Wonderful. You told me you'd have this picture destroyed. Destroyed? If I'd done that, they'd never have seen it! They? Oh, you know, those women. Those bead-twirlers. They called just before they left. They've gone... I mean, they've gone? They saw that picture in the paper. They said they were taking the first train back to Mexico City. I advised them to take a plane. It's quicker. What... What are you trying to do, marry us off? Good heavens, no. You don't even care for each other, do you? Certainly not! Of course not! I didn't think so. Any girl who throws drinks in people's faces in nightclubs... fine thing. You deserved it. I deserved it? Yes, you deserved it and you got it. What about all those insults you were handing out last night? Insults? What about the night you came in here with all that... "Forgive me,Johnny'"stuff? I had to do that because I wanted to sing. What about you pinching girls in front of your own father? I was forced into it. I never pinch girls in front of my own father, unless I'm forced into it. I don't care why you did it, it hurt. What do you want me to do about it? Well,you can say you're sorry. What about the drink? Well, I'm sorry about that. All right, I'm sorry I pinched you then. Honest? Mm-hmm. Never do it again? Never. Promise? Mm-hmm. Johnny!
