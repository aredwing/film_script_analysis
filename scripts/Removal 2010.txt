HENRY, AS MUCH AS YOU WAN THIS CAT-AND-MOUSE THING TO TURN ME ON, IT REALLY DOESN'T. I THINK I GOT OVER RICH BAD BOYS WHEN I WAS ABOUT 20, AND RICH MARRIED GUYS WHEN I WAS ABOUT 25.

I THINK YOU CAN SEE IT'S NOT MINE. SO NO ONE SEES HER FOR OVER A WEEK AND THEN SHE JUST POPS IN AND SIGNS SOMETHING THAT, FROM WHAT YOU TELL ME, WOULD SEND HER OVER AND THEN SWINGS OU TO DISCUSS LITERATURE? THAT'S THE STORY I'M GOING WITH, SURE. YOU DO REALIZE THA FORGING A SIGNATURE ON A LEGAL DOCUMEN IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE? PLEASE CUFF ME.

TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE FLOORS LOOK LIKE THEY WERE DONE LAST WEEK. Mike: So do it again. - COME ON, MIKE. - Run a spot check on it. The guy called for an estimate-- - WHO IS THIS GUY? - How the fuck - He's not exactly in my social circle. Speaking of social, are you gonna finally bring your mystery family to my house on Sunday or is it just gonna be you again? YEAH, SURE. Kirby: YEAH, AND AS FOR THE WIFE, SPOTTING A FUCKING CALIFORNIA CONDOR. YEAH, PROBABLY, LIKE CHOPPED HER UP AND MAILED HER TO THE NEWSPAPER Mike: Hello? - I GUESS WE COULD SHOW IT TOMORROW.

AND I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE LOOKING TO HAVE ALL THE ROOMS SERVICED? OKAY. AND WHEN DID YOU WAN THE WORK DONE? IMMEDIATELY-- TONIGHT. WELL, I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT GONNA BE POSSIBLE. AND BY THAT YOU MEAN WHAT EXACTLY? I MEAN I CAN'T DO IT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. WITH AN ATTITUDE LIKE THAT, IT'S NO SURPRISE YOU'RE THE ONE HOLDING THE CLIPBOARD. LOOK, A HOUSE THIS SIZE, IN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME-- IT'S A THREE-MAN JOB AT LEAST. LOOK, I CAN SCHEDULE YOU FOR AN APPOINTMENT NEXT WEEK. I'LL BRING A COUPLE OF GUYS, DO A BEAUTIFUL JOB FOR YOU. LET'S TRY IT THIS WAY: I'M NOT ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU THINK IS POSSIBLE. I NEED THE JOB DONE AND I DON'T CARE IF IT TAKES YOU ALL NIGHT TO DO IT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR, I GET YOU'RE A WEALTHY GENTLEMAN-- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M WEALTHY? FOR STARTERS, YOUR HOUSE IS A DEAD GIVEAWAY. OKAY, LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU, COLE, IF THAT'S REALLY YOUR NAME AND NOT THE LAST GUY WHO DIED IN THAT SUIT-- YOU DON'T PAY FOR A HOUSE LIKE THIS WITH MONEY. YOU PAY FOR IT WITH CLARITY AND WELL-BEING. YOU PAY FOR IT WITH AN ALL-CONSUMING REPULSION TOWARD THE CONCEP OF FAILURE. SO WHEN A MAN SAYS TO ME, "I CAN'T DO IT," IT MAKES ME WANT TO THROW UP. AND I'M GLAD THAT IT DOES, BECAUSE THE DAY THAT I SAY, "I CAN'T DO IT," IS THE DAY THAT I TASTE THE BARREL OF MY SHOTGUN. AND, WELL, COLE, I'M NO READY TO DIE TODAY. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST TAKE IT BACK-- YOU DON'T SEEM TO FEEL THE SAME. I'M PREPARED TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER-- $5000 TO COMPLETE THE JOB YOURSELF, TONIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, ALL BILLING GOES THROUGH THE OFFICE, I'M TALKING ABOUT $5000 IN CASH IN YOUR HAND. THAT'S IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER I AM CHARGED SIR, THAT IS A VERY GENEROUS OFFER, I'M COMING OFF FIVE STRAIGHT DAYS AND THIS IS A THREE-MAN JOB AT LEAST. AND I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR ONE MAN. ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME I DIDN'T EVEN GET THAT MUCH? WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU IS AFTER A WEEK LIKE THIS I'M A LIABILITY. I'M INSURED. I CAN'T DO IT. ASSHOLE. (door alarm dinging) Cole's voice: YOU-- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE ASKING ME TO LEAVE. Jennifer: I JUST-- I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD FOR SAMMY. I'VE ALREADY STARTED THE PROCESS AND ALL I ASK IS THA YOU DON'T FIGHT ME ON IT. THIS IS CRAZY. YOU KNOW THAT? THIS IS REALLY CRAZY. I'M NOT GONNA TAKE EVERYTHING. I'M GONNA LEAVE SOME OF MY STUFF HERE. I ASSUME THAT'S ALL RIGHT? IT'S FINE. SAMMY'S GAME ON SUNDAY-- I SUPPOSE I'M NO WELCOME THERE EITHER. LOOK, WHAT DO YOU WAN FROM ME? HONESTLY, I JUST WANT YOU TO GET BETTER AND START SUPPORTING THIS FAMILY LIKE YOU USED TO. JESUS CHRIST. CLEAN THIS UP. (lawnmower whirring) FUCK. (door alarm dings) HELLO? HELLO.

JUST-- YOU KNOW, I WAS GOING THROUGH AND ISN'T THE WHOLE THING WITH MARRIAGE THAT YOU HELP OU THE OTHER PERSON-- RICHER OR POORER, SICKNESS AND HEALTH THERE WAS THIS TIME WHERE I REALLY NEEDED BUT NOPE, SHE JUS COULDN'T DO IT. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE PERSON WHO'S ON YOUR SIDE IS LEADING THE CHARGE AGAINST YOU. FUNNY HOW THAT CHANGES SO FAST. I USED TO THINK A STRONG MAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING HIMSELF. THE TRUTH IS, THE ONLY REAL STRENGTH IS REALIZING THA YOU CAN'T DO IT ALONE. I'LL DRINK TO THAT. YEAH, SUSAN-- SHE'S ALL RIGHT, I GUESS. THE TRUTH IS, MY WIFE AND I... (voice distorted) (phone ringing) DON'T YOU WAN TO GET THAT? HEY, THE THINGS I WANT TO DO, I DO. THE THINGS I DON'T WAN TO DO, I DON'T DO. Henry's voice: You've reached Please leave a detailed message and someone will get back to you (machine beeps, clicks) SO YOU STILL WAN TO SETTLE UP? JESUS. FUCK IT.

THINGS GOT A LITTLE OUT OF HAND, I GUESS. OH, BUT DON'T WORRY. IT'S-- IT'S WINE. MOSTLY IT'S WINE. I'D SAY PARDON THE MESS, BUT THE MESS IS WHAT I'M MOST PROUD OF. DOES YOUR WIFE KNOW THAT--? WHAT? THAT I KILLED HER SHIT? SHE'S GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN THAT RIGHT NOW. EITHER THA OR NO PROBLEMS AT ALL, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. OH RIGHT. I FORGOT TO SHOW YOU THE BEST PART. COME ON, CHECK IT OUT. LADY'S POWDER ROOM. IN ALL FAIRNESS, YOU KNOW, I TOOK THE IDEA FROM SUSAN. WHEN WE WERE FIRST TOGETHER, SHE USED TO WRITE ME THESE MESSAGES IN HER LIPSTICK. I USED TO PRETEND TO LIKE IT. SHIT, I MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY LIKED I BUT THEN IT STARTED TO SEEM, I DON'T KNOW, KIND OF CHEAP TO ME, LIKE SOMETHING A HOOKER WOULD DO. LADY'S POWDER ROOM. JUST ONCE I'D LIKE TO HEAR ONE OF THESE REAL ESTATE PEOPLE "AND HERE'S THE ROOM WHERE THE LADY WILL TAKE MOST OF HER SHITS-- NOT ALL OF HER SHITS, 'CAUSE SHE'LL PROBABLY TAKE ONE OR TWO SHITS IN A DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM, JUST TO KEEP THE STAFF ON THEIR TOES." AND THAT'S IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IF I WALK INTO A BATHROOM IN THIS HOUSE AND THE TOILET PAPER ROLL IS NOT FOLDED TO A PERFECT POIN LIKE THAT-- IF IT'S NOT FOLDED TO A PERFECT POIN I'M GONNA LOSE MY MIND. DO YOU SEE THAT? YOU SEE THAT? YOU SEE THAT LITTLE GUY RIGHT THERE? AS LONG AS I HAVE THAT, EVERYTHING'S PERFECT. YOU SEE THAT? NOW LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, GUY: IS THA THE TOILET PAPER ROLL POIN OF A MAN WHO JUST KILLED HIS WIFE AND KID? - WHAT? - HUH? DID YOU JUST SAY YOU KILLED YOUR SHIT. DID I? BECAUSE IF I DID, IT WAS A MISTAKE. BECAUSE IF I DIDN' KILL THEM, IT'D BE A MISTAKE TO SAY THAT I DID, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE FALSE AND SO A MISTAKE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF I DID KILL THEM, IT'D BE A MISTAKE TO TELL YOU THAT I DID, BECAUSE THEN YOU'D KNOW AND I'D HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. AND YOU'D WANT TO RESIS AND THERE'D BE A STRUGGLE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. AND THAT'D BE TOO BAD, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE'RE FINALLY STARTING TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME, YOU PATHETIC, USED-UP SHELL. SOME PEOPLE ARE COMING HERE TOMORROW, TO SEE THIS PLACE. AND IT WON'T DO FOR THEM TO SEE YOU READ ME? IT JUST WON'T DO. - I CAN'T DO IT. - BULLSHIT YOU CAN'T. - IT'S TOO MUCH. - WE HAD A DEAL. - YOU SAID-- - I SAID "ALL THE ROOMS." ARE YOU REALLY IN ANY POSITION IT'S LATE. IT'S A THREE-MAN JOB. SHUT THE FUCK UP! THATTABOY. (phone buzzes) WOMEN-- JUST LIKE TARGET PRACTICE, RIGHT? YOU KNOCK ONE OUT, ANOTHER ONE POPS UP RIGHT IN HER PLACE. UH, YOU MIGHT THINK ABOU GETTING STARTED THERE. AFTER ALL, YOU'RE JUST ONE GUY. Jennifer's voice: THERE'S NO ONE HERE. Dr. Segal's voice: GIVEN THE PARTICULARS IN ADDITION TO THE ADDED STRESS OF A RECENT... JESUS. FUCK. Jennifer's voice: I DON'T FEEL SAFE WITH YOU ANYMORE. HELLO, COLE. SHUT UP. YOU'RE NOT REAL. Kershe's voice: ALL RIGHT, IF YOU SAY SO. I BET THIS LOOKS FAMILIAR. NO? YOU KNOW, IN THE END IT'S NOT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE'RE DIFFEREN THAT DEFINE US, COLE. IT'S THE THINGS WE'VE SHARED. THAT IS OUR STRENGTH. I DON'T KNOW WHA YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING. WELL, IT'S NOT YOUR PRIVATE PROPERTY, COLE. YOU ONLY WORK HERE, RIGHT? SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS? KNOWS WHAT? ABOUT US. ABOUT YOU AND ME. KERSHE. AT YOUR SERVICE. SHUT UP. I-- YOU'RE NOT REAL. YEAH. I'M AFRAID IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED YOU THINK YOU'RE THE GUY IN THE UNIFORM WITH HIS NAME STITCHED ONTO THE TAG, BUT YOU'RE NOT EVEN THE SUIT. YOU'RE JUS THE NAME ON THE TAG. (panting) I'M LOSING MY MIND. YOU DON'T HAVE A MIND TO LOSE. YOU'RE NOT REAL. UNFORTUNATELY, COLE, YOU'RE NOT REAL. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO TO ME? YOU REALLY DON' REMEMBER, DO YOU? OR ELSE YOU WON'T. IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT-- THE LENGTHS THAT WE'LL GO TO TO FORGET THE TERRIBLE THINGS WE'VE DONE? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING TO ME? SHH. TAKE IT EASY, COLE. I HAD BEEN SUFFERING FROM CERTAIN DELUSIONS. AND FROM WHAT I COULD GATHER, LIFE WITH ME HAD BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR MY FAMILY. I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT YOU KNOW HOW FUCKING HARD THIS HAS BEEN FOR ME. SO I ADMITTED MYSELF INTO A 30-DAY TREATMENT PROGRAM. Jennifer: I DON'T FEEL SAFE BUT WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR ME TO GO HOME, IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGH THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA. AND THESE ARE FOR YOU AS WELL. USE ONLY AS DIRECTED ON THE LABEL. NO MIXING WITH ALCOHOL. OKAY. Kershe's voice: EVERYBODY WAS CONCERNED THAT I WAS GONNA HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME OUT THERE IN THE BIG BAD WORLD. I ASSURED THEM THEY WERE WRONG. BUT THEY'D ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MINDS. Jennifer: I'VE ALREADY STARTED AND ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU DON' Kershe's voice: I WAS ASKED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE THAT I HAD PAID FOR... THIS IS FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE. Kershe's voice: ...BY THE WOMAN SO FUCKING HARD TO GIVE IT TO. AND I KNEW AT THAT MOMENT THAT-- WELL, THAT I WAS ALL ALONE IN THE WORLD. THAT WAS A FEELING THAT FOLLOWED ME EVERYWHERE. CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME JUST EXACTLY HOW THE FUCK SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS? - MR. KERSHE. - TAKE IT EASY. DON'T TELL ME TO TAKE IT EASY, TODD. Kershe's voice: AND WITH NOBODY IT BECAME PALPABLY OBVIOUS THAT EVERYONE WAS AGAINST ME. AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THE CLOSEST TO ME-- THEY WERE THE WORS OFFENDERS OF ALL. Sam: MOM! Kershe's voice: AND I UNDERSTOOD THEIR TO BE AN ATTACK... THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO KILL ME WITH THEIR DISREGARD. SO I DID WHAT I FEL I HAD TO DO TO PROTECT MYSELF. (two gunshots) (gunshot) I DIDN'T KILL MY FAMILY. NO, YOU DIDN'T. I KILLED MY FAMILY. I KNOW YOU. YOU'D HAVE DONE THE EXACT SAME THING. SHH. BUT THEN I HAD A NEW PROBLEM. THE THREAT HAD BEEN EFFECTIVELY SILENCED, BUT IN ITS PLACE I FOUND A RATHER UNMANAGEABLE MESS. AND THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT IT HAD TO BE TAKEN CARE OF, BUT IN MY STATE I KNEW THAT I WAS IN NO CONDITION I KNEW I NEEDED HELP. SO I LOOKED DEEP INTO MYSELF FOR STRENGTH AND THERE YOU WERE, COLE. I'M PRETTY SURE... THERE'S NO WAY I COULD HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT YOU. YOU WERE CALM AND COLLECTED AND EFFICIENT. (whistling a tune) YOU ASSESSED THE JOB. YOU GATHERED THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS AND WEN RIGHT TO WORK... METHODICALLY REMOVING ALL THE TRACES OF THE MESS THAT I WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO CREATE BUT WAS TOO FUCKING WEAK TO SEE THROUGH TO THE END. AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, COLE... YOU DID A HELL OF A JOB. YOU'RE INSANE. WELL, WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE. BEFORE YOU DO, YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK IN THE SHOWER. I'M ACTUALLY A LITTLE SURPRISED HE LEFT I OFF THE GRAND TOUR. IT'S QUITE A SHOW-STOPPER. GO AHEAD. IT'S NOTHING YOU HAVEN' SEEN BEFORE. (engine grinding) (insects chirping) Kershe's voice: I'M GONNA LEAVE SOME JUST IN CASE. I HOPE THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. (knocks) I NOTICED YOU'RE NOT HELPING ME (knocks) I'M TALKING TO YOU, GUY. YOU DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA LET YOU JUS COLE. LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS. WHY DO YOU THINK HE WAS SO INSISTEN ABOUT HAVING JUST ONE GUY CLEAN THIS WHOLE BIG HOUSE? MAYBE BECAUSE HE COULDN' HANDLE MORE THAN ONE WHEN THE JOB WAS FINISHED? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M NOT READY TO DIE TONIGHT. I CAN MAKE I DOWN TO THE HIGHWAY AND HITCHHIKE MY WAY OUT. THEN WHAT? YOU DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA COME AFTER YOU? 'CAUSE HE WILL. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I'M SAYING WE DID IT BEFORE. HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO DO IT AGAIN? I CAN'T. I CAN'T DO IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO. WE STICK TO WHAT WE'RE GOOD AT. I'LL MAKE THE MESS. YOU CLEAN IT UP. TRUST ME, COLE, OKAY? JUST TRUST ME. A SPECIAL SOLUTION-- YOU KNOW, FOR THE REALLY TOUGH STAINS. YEAH, ALL RIGHT. (whistling a tune) (continues whistling) HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. LET ME SEE THOSE BOOTIES. HUH-UH. THERE. PUT DOWN THE BOX AND PUT ON THE BOOTIES. SO WHAT DO YOU WAN TO HEAR FIRST-- THE GOOD NEWS OR THE BAD NEWS? WELL, THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THERE'S NO $5000 IN THIS HOUSE. SO THERE'S THAT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT I WON THIS BA AT AN AUCTION AND, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, IT'S QUITE VALUABLE-- QUITE VALUABLE. IN FACT I THINK I PAID JUST OVER $5000 FOR IT. AND THAT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO. THERE'S GARBAGE UNDER THE SINK. A SPECIAL SOLUTION, HUH? FOR THE REALLY TOUGH STAINS? I MEAN, IS THAT WHA WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE-- THE REALLY TOUGH STAINS? HEY, GUY, WHY IS THERE--? SHH. KERSHE? (phone ringing) Henry's voice: You've reached Please leave a detailed message and someone will get back to you (machine beeps) (woman over phone) Oh, um... Henry, it's-- Well, it's me. It's Susan. So, um... Listen. I don't know exactly what I was gonna say. THE TRUTH IS, MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN HAVING SOME It's pretty late. I hope I'm not waking you up. - I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HER IN A FEW WEEKS. SHE'S UP WITH MY KID IN SONOMA. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THAT MEANS, I really just wanted to call and talk. I guess I'm thinking that we should try It's only money, you know? I GUESS WE'RE GONNA TRY TO PATCH THINGS UP-- I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HER IN A WHILE, BUT I WAS THINKING OF CALLING HER TOMORROW. Susan: And Samuel-- well, Samuel really misses his dad, you know? Okay. I shouldn't be leaving all of this Call me when you get this and we'll-- okay. Call me back. Bye.

NO, I WOULDN'T DARE. IT'S JUST I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE MISSED A SPOT. WHAT SPOT? WELL, NOT SO MUCH A SPOT REALLY, BUT A RATHER ANNOYING BRITISH REAL ESTATE AGENT. SHE SAW US. SO DID THE HOUSEKEEPER. YEP, GOOD POINT. SEE, NOW YOU'RE THINKING. THAT'S JUST GREAT. UM, THE OWNER DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANSWERING THEIR PHONE. WELL, THAT'S JUST GREAT. SHE'S BEING SARCASTIC FOR A CHANGE. OH. (chuckles) WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE IS A PRIVATE DRIVEWAY, TWO SECURITY GATES. THERE IS A SIX-CAR GARAGE OVER THAT WAY. THE GROUNDS ARE IN IMPECCABLE CONDITION. AND I'M SURE THE SAME CAN BE SAID ABOUT THE FLOORS. I THINK I'M JUS GONNA TRY KNOCKING. HELLO?
