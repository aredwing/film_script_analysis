Yeah. I want you to do it. I'd like you to release the information. Good evening. GARDA have revealed new details on the assult that took place on the 3rd of july. This report from Ken O'Shea. At 12:40 am on Saturday, a young man was walking on Vexford street in the city centre In the direction of Rathmayer, when he was approached by two men According to GARDA he was subjected to a totally unprovoked attack where he was beaten and dragged up an alley Where he suffered a further violent assault. This was a particularly vicious attack which was entirely unprovoked. The victim was taken up a laneway where he was severly beaten.. .. before his assailants used a knife to castrate him. This is not your average mugging or alcohol-fueled fight. It was a cruel and savage act of violence. Which you can appreciate, has left the victim devastated. GARDA has released this CC-TV footage of the attackers. GARDA are appealing to the public to reveal any information... Paul? Paul, please open the door. I saw the news. That's healed nicely. Keep it clean and let the air out of it. The ringing in your ears is Tinnitus. There's nothing I can do for it. But hopefully it will ease, given time. And for your taste and smell.. .. well I can't guarantee anything. Brain injuries are very complicated. But don't.. worry about it just yet. I'm putting you on these; Andrial. They'll replace the testosteron your body would have produced before the.. ...assault. If you notice any side-effects, come back to me immediately. And as for sex.. You'll be capable of erections.. .. You'll be also be able to ejaculate, there just won't be any sperm. Once we've established the correct dose of Andrial.. ..your libido should stabilize. Many people with testicular cancer.. ..who have been through castration, live perfectly normal lives. Weight gain is a possibility but a healthy diet and excersize can combat that. I'll monitor the dose of Andrial, and we can up the dose if needed, but in the meantime.. Try joining a Gym. And follow a healthy diet, huh? There is an operation that might help. It's basically a cosmetic procedure where you would have a prostethic implant.. .. inserted into the testicular sack. Yes, I'd like that. I'll set it up. It's a very simple operation done under local anastethics, No need to spend the night. Thank you. I'm also going to refer you to a psychiatrist Dr. Kuzak. Make an appointment as soon as possible. This place could do with a bit more light. You've got no food? - I'm not hungry. You have to eat. Geez Michelle, I know you want to help but.. ..I'd rather be alone Okay. Michelle? That night.. Did you feel something between us? Yeah. I still do. So Ian, have we reached a new low in violence in our Irish streets? It's very easy to fall into the tabloid.. ..Hysteria about things, but sometimes it's right to be weary about just walking down the street. ..but there's a grotesk malevolence that we witness on the streets now .. where we actually see people engaging in recreational violence Do you think we're becoming a more brutal society? We have become a more brutal society .. And we are become a more brutal society again, on top of that. And the acceleration of that is almost exponential. People are sick and tired of feeling affected and people don't like feeling affected and that brings a resentment and it brings a hostility. basically ordinary people are closer to snapping, under less provocation. than they would have in the past. We're now reaching a tipping point ..and I'm worried what we're going to see in this country in the next 5-10 years. Is it merely as simple as 'we drink too much'? What part does alcohol play? Once again, one of the problems we've had with legalization in the past Is that people use booze as some sort of exhonorating.. practice. And that's not good enough, because they put themselves in that situation. They chose to get drunk, and they chose to let their inhibitions fall to a degree .. that they become a menace to society. So what lengths do you think you should be allowed to go to defend yourself. and to protect ourselve in the face of violence? If somebody breaks into my house, I'll kill him. It's too heavy for you man. Are you okay? - Yeah.. If you want to lift heavier, give me a shout and I'll spot you. Please.. Ian.. Just doing my job Paul.. you know.. Yeah but I'm trying to get my life back. Jesus Paul.. Are you alright? No. Please. Yeah, of course. Thanks. If you need anyt..? Yeah. Thanks Ian. Paul, is it? - Yes. You can go on in now. Thank you. You can go on in, and just sit over there. Thank you. How are you? Ok. How do you feel about what's happened to you, Paul? I can't forget about it. It's constantly with me. Anything sets it off.. Sound.. Light.. ...Sudden movement. Even the look on someone's face. It's important to take steps in your life that will give you a bit of control back. You might try a support group for victims of violent assault. Also you could try self-defence classes. Some victims find this gives them a sense of empowerment. Do you understand, Paul? Yea. Is there anything you can do to help yourself? I'm waiting for plastic surgery. How will that make you feel? Normal. Hi. - Hi... Come in.. Sorry for coming un-announced. I thought I'd get you some food. How are you? Alright. Self defence classes. An ex of mine runs these. I can introduce you if you like? To your ex? Don't worry, he's one of the good guys. How many ex's do you have? That doesn't sound.. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to help. - I know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hello everybody. For those of you that don't know me.. My name is Tom Kirren. Welcome to my class. Everything is quite relaxed here. All I do ask is that you treat eachother with respect. The first thing we're going to do is demonstrate how to break a fall correctly. Ok. So, if you want to pair up and have a go, that'd be great. Hiya, I'm Jane. - Paul Paul, I'm gonna go first, okay? Ready? Yea. No! You alright? Are you alright? - Yeah.. What's your name? Paul. Paul. What happened? I don't know, something just came over me. I mean, what happened? Something bad? I got attacked. Well. There's two things we can do. You can leave now, and let this thing beat you. ..Or, you can go back on the mat. Ok. Back on the mat? Yeah. Good man. Now listen. Forget about this, okay? Yeah. I'll show you what to do, just a gentle push, alright? Fantastic, well done. Want to go again? Yea. Scalpel please.. Thank you.. Diathermic. Close please. Good. Now, retractor. And I'm going to create a small pouch now. What's the heart rate? - Sinus rythm at 85. Good. I'm glad it's gone so well. Just a day or two and you will feel heaps better. See how you feel, maybe we get get some groceries on the way home. Pick up a take-away if you feel like it. Just give it time. It'll be okay. No it's not! It's what everyone keeps telling me. I know already this isn't going to help me. It's not. Okay. I remember the nurse in the hospital on the night of the attack telling me it's okay. You'll be alright. What can she do? What can you do? Huh? Nothing! Do you think this is easy for me? Seeing someone I care about hurt so much? Fuck off. Could you have done it? - Maybe. I didn't know I was standing in that path. I realized I wasn't scared anymore. Scared of what? The life I've been living since the attack. I thought an operation would make me feel like a man again. Is that how you define a man? By his testicles. No. I'd give anything to be able to go back. To be able to react like a man. That doesn't make a man either Paul. How the fuck do you know what it means to be a man? Would you like to see a male psychiatrist? I don't want to see any man. Wait until you see this broad from last night..... Beautiful... Check out the piss-flaps on that... Beautiful curves... What did you do to her? I wrapped my dick around her neck .. and choked her to death Fuck her up the ass? Fuck eachother up the ass! What did you say to me? You heard me. Leave it out lads. He's alright. Thanks. You crazy, man? I'm looking for steroids. Can you get them? Hold on. (Speaks Russian) I can get you metherol. It's a steroid that give you aggressive, power. Strong. Yes.. um.. when? I can get you now. Yes? I want to make a statement. In connection with? It's more a statment of intent. My name is Paul Graynor, and I will be wearing a knife for my protection. I just wanted you to know this, in case I have to use it. I have to inform you, that carrying a knife is an offense under the weapons and firearms act. I am aware of this. I want you to take a record of it. Why don't you go home, and think about what you are saying. I want you to write it down. Paul Graynor, 38 aenger street Dublin. Okay Paul. Are you carrying a knife on you now? No, but I intend to. Is that it? - Yes. Thank you. Hey man. Would you like to see any of them? I'm looking for something a bit bigger. Bit bigger.. let me see. That's a great hunter knife. That'll cut through anything. I'll take it. Hey. Thanks for coming. Sit down. How have you been? Ok. I just wanted to say sorry.. I.. ...shouln't have shouted at you.
