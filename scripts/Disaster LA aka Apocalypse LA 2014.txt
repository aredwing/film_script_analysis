Everybody was a little scared... ...because the president doesn't just get up and leave a press conference. You know, everyone was terrified in that conference room. We don't know what made the president leave... ...but we deserve some answers, I think, from the government. - Hey, what's up, man? - What's up? Oh, it's like a V6. Oh, my God. John. John. - John. - Dr. Scott. - Buddy. Hello, my friend. - Hey, man. What's up? - Hold up. Nuts. - Nut. Nuts. - How does it feel to be done with school? - It's awesome. The school was kicking my ass, though. That shit was wack. Moving on to bigger and better things now. Speaking of which, who do we have here? This is Samantha. Samantha, this is John. Samantha, um, lives down the street from you. I know Samantha. - Trust me, not only is Scott now a doctor... - Hold on. - Veterinarian. - ...but he's also one of the best guys I know. I have to warn you that he will find a way to screw up this conversation. Don't listen to him, okay? Because this guy is not full-- He's full of it because really, I'm dirty. Heh. No, I mean-- I don't mean that in a sexul way. Unless you like that. You like that? I mean, I could be. See what I mean? Hey, John. Get your ass over here. It's time for some shots. Our presence has been requested in the kitchen. Screw up this conversation later. Don't leave, okay? Please don't leave. Take a nut. Everybody, all right, grab a glass. Grab a glass. Hey, shut up. Grab a glass. You too, Astrid. Okay, I'm not one for speeches... ...so I'm gonna keep this short, okay? For the past year, I've come to know all of you like a family, okay? And I love each of you very much, especially you, man. Oh, I know. I know. When we drove out here, I never would have thought... ...I'd be the only one left still unemployed. - Big surprise. - So having said that... ...I'll strike a little deal with you guys, okay? The first person-- The first person who gets me a job, I will let have sex with my blow-up doll. - Yeah! - Okay. - Okay, that's-- Put her away. Put her away. - Just a joke, John. I'm just trying to have fun with the people. Okay, raise them high and toast to friends-- Correction. Family. Family, good tunes... ...good brew and the best firsts... ...anybody can ever hope to have in a new city. Cheers. - Yeah! - Get them up there. Seconds? Who wants seconds? I'll keep these going all night. - Going all night? - John. What's the deal, man? Didn't you guys break up, like, two weeks ago? - Dude, I can go kick his ass if you want. - No, I'm fine, you guys. This is a celebration, right? - And we're celebrating. - Copy that, brother. So there. - Do it, man. - I'll be right back. - Hey, hey, yeah. - No fucking serious. Tori. Hi. John, hi. How are you? Good. Good. Things are, uh, really good. - How about yourself? - Good. Yeah. Yeah. I'd just been really busy with school and other stuff. Heh. Yeah. Uh.... So who is your friend here? Oh, God. I'm sorry. This is Jacob. Jacob, nice to meet you. I'm John. Tori told me a lot about you. I just want you to know that, uh, she's in good hands. Really? That's good to hear. Very comforting. - Look, I hope that this isn't awkward-- - No. No, no, no, this-- It's fine, right? We're all adults. Let's skip it. Ah. So, Jacob, can I get you anything to drink? Glad you asked. Kind of feeling a Long Island Iced Tea. I'm not gonna lie. - Heh. - Heh. All right, that's a.... I'll go get that for you. - Long Island Iced Tea. - It's like he never heard of it before. What a rookie. So, what's the verdict? You know, what I thought, typical frat boy. He looks like a cowgirl with that shirt. I could take his head, dunk him in our toilet. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I know it's hard, but it's a big city and there are plenty of good girls out there. - You just need one. Just one. - Yeah, he's right. What do you know, Adam? How many girls have you been with since we got here, huh? - Shut up. No, you shut up. - No, you shut up. Can we be a little mature here, please? Please? - Mature? Really? - Huh? Yeah. Well, we just now have breaking news coming in. - We go now to the top story of the hour. - Guys, come over here. Check this out. Amateur photographers are capturing-- - What's going on? - Everyone, shut up. Yeah, I got this. You might be one of many viewers trying to figure out... ...what those mysterious bright lights are. Truth is you're not the only one. NASA, along with the Russian space program... ...alerted the media that it is believed to be a group of meteors from deep outer space. They say they are still investigating the matter... ...but need more time to make a valid assessment. Some astronomers managed to come to their own conclusion... ...after remote surface temperature readings... ...indicated the meteors are mostly comprised of ice... ...resembling glaciers rather than rocks. Space programs wrapped up the press conference... ...by saying that these meteors pose absolutely no threat to us... ...and are expected to safely pass by Earth tomorrow morning. Dude, I see it. Wait. What? What? Seriously? - Where is this? - There it is. There. - Come on, out here. - Yeah. My gosh, imagine if that thing actually hit us. Whoa, that's scary. How big did they say it was? - This calls for shots. - Oh, no. - No, no, no. - Hey, dude. Hey, you said it yourself, we just missed out on the apocalypse. If it didn't deserve a toast, I don't know what the hell does. Everybody, get in here. John, get your head in the game, bro. Grab a glass. Toast to tomorrow. Because with each night you live... ...you never know what tomorrow's gonna bring. Right? I'll drink to that. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hello? Adam. Adam. - What happened? - I don't know. I don't freaking know. Where is everybody? Your guess is as good as mine. Look, just go in the house and turn off the gas, all right? I'm going to Davey's to make sure they're okay. All right. David? - David. - He's out front. - What's going on? - I don't know. Just stay inside. - David. - We're out here. - You guys okay? - Yeah, we're all right. Amy? Amy, stay inside till we know what's going on, all right? - Dude, what's going on? - Hey. - What do you guys see up there? - Lots of smoke. Looks like Downtown, possibly North Hollywood. How bad is it? Looks pretty freaking bad. - What is going on? - I don't know. My sister goes to UCLA... - ...said a bunch of things just hit the campus. - What? She doesn't know, but they're everywhere. Amy. - Amy, stay inside. - Have you seen my brother? - Amy! - Have you seen my brother? Not since last night. Don't know where he is. - I'll check in with you later. - All right. Good luck. Be careful. Amy, stay inside. - What does it say? - Shut up, shut up. Turn it up, Adam. the Los Angeles area... ...ranging from Downtown all the way to Santa Monica. Police and fire departments are working together. Thousands, if not tens of thousands of citizens... ...have been injured or killed in this horrifying incident. - Oh, my God. - We can't confirm... ...but sources are indicating the explosions may or may not... ...be related to last night's meteor sighting-- - Where's my brother? - I thought he was with you. - Where's my brother? Where is Turner? - I don't know. He was gonna stay at a friend's house, Ricky. - Mickey. Mickey. - Damn it. - What--? Wait, where are you going? - We strongly recommend to our viewers... ...that you stay indoors until we figure out what's going on. - Yeah, hello? - Turner, thank God, okay. - All you all right? - Yeah. Oh, my God. - Are you seeing what's happening outside? - Stay where you are. I'm coming to get you. - Why? We're perfectly fine. - Look, just wait at Mickey's. - I'm on my way, all right? - John, I don't-- - Did you hear me? - What? No, just wait at Mickey-- I'm coming to get you, all right? Just-- Hello? Turner! Shit! Turner? Hello? Turner! --were in fact meteor-related... ...and now we are being told that more might be on the way. Official satellite photographs indicate that yet another meteor... ...roughly the size of a school bus... ...may hit the city within the following hour. We recommend to our viewers that you seek shelter immediately. The government is instructing people to follow-- Hey. Wait. Wait, Mickey. - What? - Where's my brother? Everybody's at the top of the parking structure trying to get a better look. Are you coming? - Turner. - Hey. Hey, check it out. It's like freaking madness out there. - Look, we have to go. - Are you kidding me? We got front row seats. Jimmy ran to the store to get beer. There may be more on the way. We have to go now. Hey, check it out. I think one just hit West L.A. Wow, this is really freaking exciting, man. - Come on, we have to go right now. - All right. Hey, Mickey, save me some beers, all right? - Get in the car, put your seat belt on. - What? Why? Just do what I say. Whatever, Grandpa. There. Are you happy now? Jesus Christ. This is ridiculous. What should we do? We get back to the house and we wait for things to calm down. I can't believe this is happening. It's exciting, don't you think? Just call the guys, tell them to pack up what they can. All right, all right. Okay. Damn it, it's not working. - Try it again. - All right. Watch out! --what is going on, but I can assure you that the police are out there. They're taking care of every situation as fast and as quickly as possible. Now, uh, turning to another note... ...I'm getting some more news regarding this potential meteor... ...that's on its way to Los Angeles as I speak right now. And I don't know anything about it, but-- - Wait, wait. Now, I'm getting reports-- - Ugh. It's on its way. It's in the sky. If you look outside, you can see them in the sky. Everybody, get inside. Everybody, get inside. Is it over? I can't see anything. Nothing but smoke. Well, keep the door shut. I don't want any of that smoke to get inside here. God, is this really happening? Adam, are you okay? Yeah. I think it's just the smoke. Power must be out in the whole neighborhood. Anybody see any streetlights that are working? - It's the middle of the day. - Where's the radio? Check under the tool drawer. I can't believe this is happening. I mean, do you think anybody's dead? Wait. I see people outside. Should we make sure they're okay? - What do we do? - No, no, no, not yet. Wait till the smoke dies down more. There. Go back. --that this an isolated incident. --in Los Angeles, due to the cloud of smoke... ...police and fire have been halted until further notice. Reports that thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people... ...are believed to be dead and we expect that number to increase. Jesus Christ. We've been told by the government to relay this message: "Do not attempt to vacate the city and stay away from other people." We are getting urgent requests to tell our listeners to stay indoors. Do not try to vacate the city. - LAX and all major highways-- - So that's it, we're stuck in here now? What? No, no, no. There's no way I'm staying here. Why did they say to stay away from other people? We don't know what's going on. They know more than we do so we have to do what they say. John, look, what's the big deal, I inhale a little smoke? My girlfriend lives eight blocks from here. I gotta go and make sure she's okay. I'll bring her back. He's right. We should group up. All right. Go on, but come right back. You got it. - I'm going too. - No. No, you're staying here. Why, you're the boss of me now? - You're my kid brother, my responsibility. - You may be my older brother... ...but that doesn't mean shit when it comes time to make decisions. - If you used logic, I wouldn't have to babysit. - Is that right? - That's right. - Come on, guys. Guys, stop it! What are you doing? Come on. You could fight about this later, but right now, you need to calm down. Now, go drink some milk or something. Are you coming? We'll be right back. All right, come on. All right, come on, through here. - Which one is it? - Number three, up top. Astrid. Astrid? Whoa, wait, wait, wait. Astrid? Baby? - Astrid. - Nate? - We're in here. - Astrid? - God, what happened? What's wrong? - I don't know. She was fine 20 minutes ago, then she just fell down. Okay, baby, just hold on, okay? What's happening to me? - I can't breathe. - Turner, get in here! Just hold on, everything's gonna be okay, all right? Just try and breathe slowly. Concentrate on breathing, all right? - I can't breathe. - Jesus Christ, Nate, what happened? I don't know, I have no idea. - What should we do? - We need to get her back to the house, okay? No. No, we need to call an ambulance. You think I didn't try? The phones aren't working. I tried 20 times. We get her to Scott, he should know what to do. - He can help. - Scott's a veterinarian. Yeah, I know that. But look, he's all we got, okay? - Turner. - All right. All right, just go get all the batteries and flashlights that you can, okay? - And any food too. - Okay. - Okay. - Hang in there. Hang in there. - Grab her arm. - Okay. We're gonna lift you, okay? Can you stand? Can you stand? Grab her arm. We're gonna lift you, okay? Can you stand? - Hang in there. - Grab her arm. We're gonna lift you. Can you stand? - Hang in there. Okay. - Grab her arm. We're gonna lift you, okay? Can you stand? Grab her arm. We're gonna lift you, okay? Can you stand? We're gonna lift you. Can you stand? If your power goes out, remain calm... ...and assist family members or neighbors who may be vulnerable... - ...if exposed to extreme heat or cold. - I think I see more people. Locate a flashlight with batteries to use until power comes back on. - Do not use candles, as this can cause a fire. - What was that? The power clicked back on. Check the breaker. Turn off sensitive electric equipment. Turn off major electric appliances that were on when the power went off. This will help to prevent power surges when electricity is restored. Keep your refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to keep cold in-- - I think that's it. - Yup, that's it. Do not use the stove to heat your home. Power's back on. Is there anything we should be doing, like trying to call police? I tried that. It's not working. Let's see what's going on. If you're just joining, reports are coming in over the waves... ...that thousands of people are now becoming extremely ill... ...due to what is believed to be toxins released from the glacial meteors... Turn it up. ...that made landfall just a while ago. Reports started coming in over the radio that people were becoming sick... ...and forced the government to quarantine the city until they figure out exactly what's going on. We've been hearing that people are becoming mentally ill... ...and in some cases, showing extreme violence. - Symptoms that can-- - What are they saying? Is there something in the smoke that's making people violent? --began quarantining the city just under an hour ago. - Is that possible? - We can't stress this enough. Do not come into contact with anyone who may show these symptoms... ..for they are considered extremely dangerous... ...and not to mention, possibly contagious. Baby, baby, hang in there. We're gonna get you help, okay? - How much further? - Just a few more blocks. Easy, easy, easy. - Scott, get over here. - Oh, my God, what happened? We don't know. Just get over here and help. - Easy, easy, easy. - Watch it. - Scott, she needs your help, man. - I'm not a doctor. Yeah, I know that. Just do something, damn it, please. Jesus Christ, she's burning up. Somebody grab some towels. - Put some water on them, okay? - I'm on it. My God, her heart sounds like it's gonna explode. Do we have any aspirin? - Somebody get some aspirin. - Scott, please help. - Please help. - Astrid, it's gonna be okay. John, get a flashlight too. Scott, what else? I don't know, goddamn it. Oh, please. Please. Please help. Please. It's all right. Give me the aspirin, John. - Here, here. - Thank you. - Baby? - Hang in there. How did this start? She just was acting funny and then she started bleeding. - I don't know. - Did she take any other kind of medications? - Anything at all? - I don't know. - Come on, yes or no? - No. Here's the towel. Okay. There we go. All right, there. Take some of these. - Try and swallow. - Try to get some in there. It's just like the TV said. What? What are you talking about? Something in the smoke, it's making people sick. Astrid's not the only one. It's happening all across the city. What's causing it? They don't know. It has to be some type of amoeba or spore. You know, something inhaled through the smoke. Wait, wait. If that's the case, then why aren't we all sick, huh? We've all inhaled some of that stuff, right? Yeah, but from what I've studied, if it's a respiratory virus... ...some show effects immediately and it may not affect others at all. What's happening? She's convulsing. Hold her arms. What? Wait, what? Hold her arms down. - Baby. Come on, baby. - Astrid? Hold on. Baby. Do something, goddamn it. Would you do something? Is she okay? It's okay. Do something. She's dead. What? Astrid? Baby? No. No! I need a drink. No. Okay. Okay, we need to come up with a plan. Plan? What kind of plan? Plan to get out of here. You did see what happened. But you heard the TV, they're quarantining Los Angeles. - Where are we gonna go? - I don't know. But unless we wanna end up like Astrid, we really don't have a choice. Well, Scott, you said so yourself. It can affect each one of us differently. And that means any one of us could start showing symptoms at any minute. Now what can we do? Who's got a plan? We could all head to the coast. Follow the beach up north. It's actually not such a bad idea, you know. The coastal winds will help dilute the air so it'll be less threatening to breathe it there. Okay, well, how will we get there? I mean, who has a car close by? My roommates. It's in the parking garage on 28th. It's a walk, but I think we can make it. All right. All right, that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna take the car to the coast and we're gonna drive ourselves out of here. We're taking her with us. Nate, uh.... You can't be serious. I can't just leave her here. Just look at her. She's gone. I don't care, all right? We're taking her with us. Jesus, Nate, John's right. Okay, man, listen to logic. All right, I know it's hard to accept Astrid's gone, okay? For all we know, she may be contagious. We can't take that risk. We have to go. - And we have to leave her. - No. Yeah, man, just have a drink and calm down. I don't want a goddamn drink, okay? Look, either we're taking her with us or I'm staying. Do you understand? I'm not about to abandon her like some kind of dead dog. I'm not gonna do that. Don't ask me to do that. - Either we take her or I'm staying. - She's gone. We can't take a dead body with us. We don't have room in the car. Astrid? Astrid? Help! Help! Astrid? Get her off me! Get her off me! Did that or did that not just happen? Scott. Is she all right? She's dead. She's freaking dead. The whole city could be like this. Anybody else think it's time for us to get out of here? Nate? All right. The sun's gonna be down soon. So if we're gonna do this, we do it now. Grab only what you need. We'll leave this house in five minutes. This is it. - Come on, Scott, do you live here or not? - You've got to-- I never used the back entrance. I'm a little bit nervous. I've never stolen a car before. - Scott, stop talking and open the door. - Okay, I got it. So, what's the plan? What roads are we taking? I say we take Lincoln all the way to Wilshire then hop on the 1 north up to Malibu. We have to make a stop first. Whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait a minute. We're not stopping anywhere. You're talking about Tori? I have to make sure she's okay. You have no idea where she is right now. She could be in a car heading out of town. - Or worse, she could be sick. - It sounds risky. I don't care what you guys think. It's on the way. And if you're adamant against it, I'll go alone. It's on the way? Yes. If she's not there, we go without her. Got it? Yeah. All right. Let's go. Guys. My roommate's car is over by the elevators. - I'll run upstairs, get the keys, be right back. - Hey, make it fast. We should check these cars for stuff that could be useful. That's a good idea. Everybody, split up. But nobody leave this level. We meet here in five minutes. Got it? Adam, come on. All right. Wait right there, all right? Hey. Thank God. Hello? Reggie? Reggie, you here? Hello. Reggie, where did you put your keys? Thank you. Reggie? - What is that? - I don't know. It's some kind of a radio. Maybe you should try another channel. Reggie, are you in there? Hello? Oh, thank God, man. Reggie, we're all leaving town, man. Come on, let's go. Reggie, come on. Let's go, man. Reggie? Oh, my God. On second thought, you better stay here. Hello? Hello? Hey, hey, I got something. What is it? I don't know. It's a weak signal. What is that? Should you try saying something? Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me? Are you okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa, what happened? Are you guys okay? Yeah, we're fine. Did you guys find anything useful? Just a radio. We can't reach anyone from down here, though. It's been 10 minutes. Where the hell is Scott? I think we need a new plan. I can't hold them. What do we do? Run! Where do we go? Scott! South tunnel! Be more specific! Keep going forward! - Scott, which way? - Left. Left! - Which way, Scott? - Left, left, turn left! Nate, come on! Keep going. - Nate! - Just go! Well? What do we do now, huh? - Which one of you has a bright idea now? - Just calm down. I'm not gonna calm down, John. You wanna know why? Because none of us are gonna make it out alive. What do we do now? - What are we gonna do? - All right, new plan. My car is only about a mile from here, so I think, considering the circumstances... ...that's our best bet. I'm going for Tori now. Oh, my God, John, you cannot be serious. Really? Her place is a couple blocks from here. I get her now, we won't have to stop later. All right, but no bullshit. If she's not there, then we leave without her. You got it? - Yeah. - What if you don't make it, huh? How will we even know? If we're not there in 40 minutes, you leave without us. Do you understand me? Yes. All right. Then that's the plan. I'm going with you. Are you sure? Yeah. All right. Forty minutes. See you there. Take care of yourself. You too. What, you kidding me? Wait! --remain calm and assist family members or neighbors... ...who may be vulnerable if exposed to extreme heat or cold. John? Oh, my God. Jo-- What are you--? What are you doing here? - Why the hell did you just hit me? - Wait, I didn't know it was you. - John, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. --when electricity is restored. My God, you're bleeding, all right? Come on, let's take care of this thing. - Tori, is everything okay? - Yeah, it's fine. It's just John. Do not use the stove to heat your home. This can cause a fire-- - Hi. I'm Tori's boyfriend, Jacob. - Use caution when driving. If traffic signals are out, treat each signal as a stop sign. - Nice to meet you too. - Stop in every intersection. Okay, this is gonna sting a little bit. You have no idea how happy I am to see you. Really? I wouldn't have guessed that. Well, what are you guys doing here? We came here to get you. To get me? Okay, why? You don't know. Know what? There's something in the smoke, making people change, making people sick. And we were on our way out of here, and I just-- I couldn't-- You couldn't what? I couldn't leave without making sure you're okay. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Look, all right, I appreciate your concern, but we are perfectly fine. You don't understand. If you stay here, you can die. - Both of you. - Trust us. - Then what's the plan? - We meet up at Turner's car... ...we drive up the coast, and get out of this mess. - That's it? That's the plan? - Yeah. That's the plan. You're coming with us. So you and Jason can go grab whatever you need so we can get out of here. His name is Jacob. - What? - Never mind. Adam. - All right, is everybody ready? - Yeah. - Jacob? - Yeah, I think so. The following is a public announcement... ...provided by the U.S. military in an attempt to warn survivors... What is that? ...of operations currently underway. - Due to the severity... - What is that? ...we are unable to maintain control. At 0500, orders are in place for the U.S. military... ...to begin the use of chemical weapons over the city of Los Angeles. If you are able to vacate the premises, you have until 5 a.m. to do so. Wait, wait, wait a minute. Chemical weapons? - What the hell are they talking about? - What's going on? It must be worse than we thought. - How long does that give us? - The following message-- - Less than five hours. - Jesus. --provided by U.S. military-- - What do we do? - We stick to the plan. We meet up with Turner. - Everybody, we're leaving now. - I'm not going. --we are unable to maintain control. - At 0500-- - What? I'm staying. Tori, if you don't mind, I like to just stay here in this apartment... - ...if that's okay. - No, no. - That's not part of the plan. We all go. - John, I'm sick. I've seen what I'm gonna become. I'd rather do it alone than burden my friends. Maybe he should stay here. You shut the hell up. Nobody asked your opinion. The following message is a public-- We are leaving this apartment. All of us. --to warn survivors... And that includes you. ...of operations currently underway. - Got it? - Due to the severity... - ...we are unable to maintain control. - All right, let's go. What the hell was that? Go. Shh, shh, shh. Go, go, go! Adam, come on. You guys go. Adam, I mean it. Come on! Please, give me this. Just get out of here. Go. Hey. Hey, up here. We're on level four. The stairs, over there. It's about time. What took you guys so long? Just get in the car. Wait, wait, where's Adam? He didn't make it. All right, let's get the vehicle moving here. We're on the clock. What's he talking about? We heard on the radio they're gonna bomb the city in a few hours. They can't be serious. I hate this city. All right, everybody buckle up. I ain't stopping this car for nothing. I can't believe this. After all I've given this city, all the parking tickets I've paid. I was planning on paying all my taxes on top of things... ...only for them to return the favor by dropping bombs on us in a crisis. What the hell kind of town is this? Who the hell is this guy? My name is Jacob. Well, Jacob, would you mind shutting your face while I drive your ass to safety? I can't think with these stupid noises coming from your fricking mouth. Heh. My father happens to be a very powerful congressman, I'll have you know... ...and one day, I plan on being a state senator. So I would watch the tone in which you are speaking. - ''The tone in which you are speaking''? - Quit it, Turner. No. Who the hell talks like that? You wanna know who talks like this? Your mother, because I had sex with her last night. Will both of you just shut the hell up? Look, I don't know who you think you are... ...from what I gather, one of my best friends died trying to save your worthless life. So please forgive me if I politely ask you to shut your freaking mouth... ...before I kick your ass out of this car! - How's that for a tone, dipshit? - Turner, just drive the damn car. I don't know how she picked you over my brother. This world just continues to surprise me. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's this? Hey, get out of the way. Are you deaf? Get out of the way. Come on. - You know, this isn't right. I don't like this. - What do you want me to do, run her over? Turner. Put the car in park and get out of the vehicle. Everybody, just stay calm, okay? I'm not gonna ask again. Just do what the man says, all right? No. - What? - I'm not giving him this car. Turner, the man has a gun. Come on, do what he says. You think I can't see that? Don't mess with him, okay? He just wants the car. I'm not giving him this goddamn car. We'll get another car. Just do what he says. Everybody, hold on. No, please. Please don't do this. Get down! No! - Oh, my God, Scott. What--? - Scott. Scott. - What happened? - He shot him. - What? Scott. Scott. - Scott, Scott. - Oh, my God. God, I'm so sorry. Scott. - Oh, my God. - Tell me what to do. What should we do? What should we do? - Scott. - Jesus, Turner, do something. - We don't have time for this. Keep going. - Scott, I'm so sorry, man. Please forgive me. This is all my fault. Please forgive me. Tori, get in the car now. We're going. - Do something. - You'll be just fine. Hang in there. Scott! Scott! - Hey! - Scott! Scott! - Scott! Scott! - Turner, he's dead, man. - Scott. - Okay, we have to go. Come on. We have to go. Turner, come on, we have to go. Scott. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Turner. What are you doing? Is he okay? Just give us a second. Turner, we have to go. Do you hear me? It's all my fault. Scott's dead and it's all my fault. It's not your fault. None of this is your fault. You did the right thing back there. Even if the rest of us were too afraid to admit it. All I wanted to do was save us. I know. I know. But, look.... It's over. There's nothing you can do to bring Scott back. Or any of our friends. What's done is done. We have to keep moving... ...or else we're gonna be next. Do you understand? Now, the coast is only a few blocks away... ...and we don't have a lot of time. So come on. Let's go. Hey, isn't that my car? God. Jesus. Looks like something got to him. What happened? Payback for stealing my car, that's what happened. Shut up, Turner. Is he okay? He's dead. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. --remain calm and assist family members or neighbors... ...who may be vulnerable if exposed to extreme heat or cold. Locate a flashlight with batteries to use until power comes back on.

Do not use the stove to heat your home. This can cause a fire or fatal gas leak. Use extreme caution when driving. - Listen to news radio stations for updates-- - Stop. Stop. Stop. Please. I can't. I can't. Wait. What? We can't stop. It's not much further. Come on. I can't. Look at me. Look at me. We have to keep moving. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's just a few more blocks. I promise. No. I mean, I'm sorry that I left you. It's all my fault, you know. And I just.... I just needed you to know that I'm sorry. I know. Oh, my God. Oh, my-- Come on. Come on. - Turner. - You guys go. - Don't give me that crap. - I know what I'm doing, okay? - We'll never make it unless I distract them. - No, we can make it. Just do what I say! I make my own decisions, remember? Now, go! Turner. Turner! - Turner! - Come on. No. Hey, over here! Come get me. Goodbye, brother.
