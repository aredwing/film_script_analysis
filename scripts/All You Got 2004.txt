You were so worried about being bad or being good. Look at the wolf. Everybody thinks he's the villain, but in reality, he blew and blew and blew... And got through the wall. And that was me? That was you. That was me out there? And not just about winning, but about the feeling you're feeling right now. It's the best feeling ever, Papi. I swear it is. Thanks, Daddy. Now, let's go home.

RADIO ANNOUNCER: We now bring you this late-breaking news report. A devastating fire has enveloped the Villa Madonna High School, home of the Madonnas, runner-up in the girls' state volleyball championship. Hey, that's Lauren McDonald's school. And the Madonnas. What? How weird is that? ...is still unknown. How crazy is that? School is out of session with students on summer vacation... Gabby, isn't your dad's fire station near there? Yeah, hold up. That's my dad's territory. We should go. We should check it out. Yo, turn around. Turn around, Rada. (sirens wailing) GABBY: Yo, Davis! My dad here? Where's my dad at? Yo, where's my dad at? Gabby, I'm sorry. How'd you get here? Who told you? What do you mean? I'm sorry. There's nothing we could do. What do you mean you're sorry? Gabby, he's gone. Hold up, where's my dad? Gabby, he's gone. Where's my dad at?! No! Where's my dad?! Papi! Gabby, no. Wait, let me go get him! I know he's in there! He's in there! Let me go get him, please! Gabby, listen to me. Listen to me. (sobbing) Papi! Let me go get him! Let me go get him! Please let me go get him! Let me go get him, please! Papi! Gabby... I want to talk to you. Will you listen to me? Si, abuela. I want you to remember that you carry the best of both parents, your father and your mother, in your heart, in your character and in your spine. You remember that? (panting) Oh, my goodness. Come on, guys, we need to stretch. No, we don't. We don't even have a school anymore. Yeah, but there's always public school. (laughs): Yeah, right. Do you all remember when we thought public school was cool? Yeah, when we were, like, five. But there is one spot open at Piedmont. Uh, look around. There's three of us. This sucks! We're gonna wind up going to different schools and playing on separate teams. Yeah, but it doesn't have to be like that. We can all go to Cathedral High. (laughs) You must be smoking something if you think I'm gonna step foot into that school. I have standards. Says the girl who made out with her yoga instructor and shoplifts at Versace. Oh... I never did... one of those things. (laughs) Well, you know what? The three of us could rule that school. It would be ours. And it's the only place that accepts all of us together. Well, do they have AP courses? They got a national championship. Oh, true. Yeah. And that's what we need. All right, so, I guess bottom line is the only way that we can all stay together is if we go to Cathedral High. No. Absolutely not. Wait a minute. Captain of a national championship team will get her a spot at SC, no problem. Think about that. Okay, thought about it. She's going to Piedmont. Scholarship at SC's worth $200,000 bucks. Which is way more than she'd ever make in her entire career playing professional volleyball. Mom, I don't care about that. All I want is to play on a championship team with my friends. Lauren, I know how hard it is to have your senior year turned upside down, but you've got to think about your future. Lauren. Come on, you got another one in you? Let's do this. Oh, Latin boys. KAITLAN: I hear they're super romantic. Oh, he's kind of hot. Oh. But so not your type. Yeah, right. Welcome to our house, ladies. It's nice. A little crowded, but, you know. GABBY: Really? It wasn't crowded until you guys got here. Look, Gabby, we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way. Look, Lauren. We're gonna do this our way. See, mama, this is Phantom territory. Y'all are just paying rent. Ew. KAITLAN: What a hooker. Oh, my God, she's giving tongue before first period. Ew. Like you wouldn't go there. You wouldn't, would you? I wouldn't. Ah. (whispering): Move it, move it, guys. Come on. Yo, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Got to get right in there. All right. Hurry up, yo. Please tell me you got to pee, please. You know, I'm probably gonna have to spend an extra two years in... Shh! Come on, come on. Yo, we ain't got all day. Here. Oh, that's disgusting. That is so gross. Trust me, it'll be worth it. Ready? (liquid pouring) Come on, come on. Come on, come on, let's go, let's go. We out. (giggling) As you all know, season opener starts in two weeks. GIRL: Who invited the Barbies? Ladies, you're late. Um, we were looking for a weight room and we didn't quite find one. And where's the trainer? 'Cause I need to be professionally stretched out so I don't tweak a hamstring. GABBY: Coach, can we get someone in here to do our nails 'cause mine are looking kinda toe-up? (girls laugh) All right, ladies. Have a seat, lady, you're late. Practice starts every day, the same time. LAUREN: Got it. And we're on time. Okay. Take a look around. There's a lot of talent on this field. That's the good news. The bad news is I only had one senior last year. And I can only carry ten. Some of y'all ain't gonna be here in six weeks. Do the math. Tryouts start right now. (blowing whistle) Let's go, move it! MAN: That's it. Good work. COACH: Hit those cones! Hit those cones! Tryout starts right now! ? ? COACH: This is not a game! GIRL: Coach, me, too? Yes, you, too! I want everybody doing push-ups! How many? I want everybody down. Down! Down? Down is down. The ground. I want everybody down, down, down. (girls whimpering) When I say up, I want you up. Down. (girls chuckle) You want laps or you want this? (scattered): Laps. All right. I want a hundred laps. Give me a hundred laps. Give me a hundred laps. Are you kidding me? (whistle blows) Huddle up! Huddle up! Are we done yet? Are we done yet? You guys are tired? You guys are tired? You want to quit? ALL: No. You guys tired? ALL: No! You want to quit? No. Well, I'm tired. Coach, you take it over. I'm going to go in. What? Letters, letters again. Let's go. Smells like the Metro in Paris in here. That a good thing? Girl, haven't you been anywhere? Yo, let the Madonnas go first. You know, since, you guys have a bus to catch and all. Thank you. BECCA: Man, there's not any hot water. This place is so prehistoric. At least there's soap. It's pee-pee! Ugh! Oh, my God. That is so disgusting. (mimicking): Oh, my God. Like I totally got like piss all over my hands. Like, oh, my God. Don't worry, mama. People's urine is sanitary. You want some? You want some of this? You know what? What is up with you? If our school hadn't burned down, we wouldn't be in this dump. I can't believe they would even come up with something like that. That's disgusting. Like who would ever...? Ugh! Please don't do that again. That was just wrong. What is her problem? I don't know. She's got an attitude. We'll adjust it. Don't worry about it. God, is Gabby ever in a good mood? Cut her some slack. Her father just died. He did? Yeah, he died in the fire saving your school. Oh, my God. Poor girl. Oh, do you mind? Come on Gabby, let's walk. It'll make you feel better. Come on. LAUREN: Hey, Gabby! Gabby! Look, we all just wanted to say how sorry we are about what happened to your dad. All of us. Sorry about your dad, Gabby. Whatever. Yeah, the fire was just awful. I mean, we all lost something. I lost my Papi. And you lost what? Your cappuccino machines and your personal trainer? Screw you. Let's go. WOMAN: All right, ladies, now we're gonna move on to the part I know you dread, but we have to learn it. It's not difficult. It's Taylor's Theorem. We all know what you can do, Lettie. Why don't we hear from some of our new students? I've seen you ladies on the court. Let's apply some of that aggressiveness here. Kaitlan, would you like to give it a try? No, thanks. All right. Who wants to come to the board? Lauren. Oh, I actually haven't finished writing it down, yet. My, my, we're all so shy. Becca. Um, can you come back to me a little bit later, please? All right, Lettie. Show 'em what you can do. Ladies, you might want to take some notes 'cause you actually might learn something today. ? ? ? ? COACH: Come on, move. Come on, move it. BOY: Wow, I think I'm in love. Who's that big girl? I hear she's the best middle blocker in all of California. Home chicken. Man, that's my favorite position. That's my boy. That's my boy. Watch your mouth. We're still in school. COACH: Quick, quick, quick feet. Let's go! Hit those cones. The blonde one's not too bad. She's a pretty good volleyball player. Wait, what about Gabby? Oh, that's right. I'm practically married to Gabby, okay. I'm looking. I can look. Gabby dumped me again, anyway. Whew, I'm sick of this. Come on. COACH: I thought you guys wanted to play volleyball? Music. You feel it? Music. Hmm, this is our new song. This is our new song. Um, drumrolls. Drumrolls, come on. We need this song. We need this song. ALL: Ladies, practice was over a half an hour ago. Like you said, Coach, "conditioning is the key to winning." I said that? Yeah. Then I was right. Good work. Thank you. That workout was hot. Ooh, hot dogs. Organic hot dogs. Did you see the look on Coach Harlan's face? Yeah. We are so in. Hey, Monster. Give the little flower a flyer. Ladies, hello. We're Dos Santos. Check our band out. It's tight. What's up? I'm the drummer. Carlos, lead guitarist. I'll open you doors to the unknown. Baby, you could call me Monster, by the way I play. Are you boys even allowed on this side of the fence? Not boys,mamacita. We're men. BOY: Yeah, right. Vamanos muchachos. You coming to watch us play? I'm Artie by the way. Lauren. I know. (screaming) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He's so cute. ? ? ? ?

Looks like the band's got some new groupie action going on. Please, mama. All I know is that if I were her, I'd be doing something about that. Look, I broke up with him on Tuesday. You break up every Tuesday. You know, I was wondering why you'd name a band "Dos" anything when there's three of you? We're heavy into irony. Plus we got skills so we can do that. I don't know, prima. I suggest you go handle that real quick. Don't... How did you get those skills? You know what they say about practice makes perfect. I do. Oh, hell no. Ooh, she's really going!

Then love should be a crime ? ? You and me ? ? Suddenly ? ? We've got nothin' to say ? ? 'Cause words get in the way. ? (music ends, applause) Yeah! Nice job. Thanks. He is so amazing. (humming) ? Mmm... ? ? Oh, yeah, oh, yeah ? ? Well, it's early in the morning ? ? And my heart is feelin' lonely ? ? Just thinking about you, baby, got me twisted in the head ? ? And I don't know how to take it ? ? But it's driving me so crazy ? ? I don't know if it's right, I'm tossing, turning... ? Can you dance like that? Yeah. ? ...Still can't sleep, thinkin' about your beauty... ? What kind of music do you like? Um... the kind on the radio. ? I think I'm in love ? ? Amor, no es amor... ? You're kind of geeky, aren't you? I like that in a girl. You do? ? Amor, no es amor... ? Come on. Expand your horizons. Oh, I don't know if this is such a great idea. ? ...That I have in my heart? ? Come on. ? Now I know you're not my lady ? ? But I'm tryin' to make this right ? ? I don't know what to do ? ? I'm going out of my mind ? ? So, baby, if you let me ? ? Kick it with you then well maybe ? ? We could ride together ? ? We could do this all night ? ? Now I don't care if you've got a man ? ? Baby, I wish you'd understand ? ? 'Cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can ? ? Well, it's 5:00 in the morning ? ? I still can't sleep ? ? Thinkin' about your beauty, it makes me weak ? ? I'm feelin' hopeless at home ? ? Don't know what to do, I think I'm in love, baby ? ? Amor, no es amor ? ? Is this an illusion ? ? That I have in my heart? ? ? Amor, amor ? ? Oh, yeah, yeah... ? Wonder what's up with Lauren? She's not returning my phone calls or my e-mails. She's probably busy reshooting our highlight reel. Hmm... You know, I kind of miss the way things used to be. Yeah, things are different. In fact, everything is different. Cathedral killed us for, like, three years straight, and I thought for sure when we went over there, I was gonna hate them. But it's really not all that bad. And the people are kinda cool. You wanna know a secret? I used to want to go to Cathedral four years ago. What?! Yeah, I really did. My father said he didn't think it would be the same as it was when he went. Shut up. You never told me that. I did! I mean, they won every game. It was always jumpin'... and they had hella boys. I was, like, loving it. But then, I also thought that it would make my father come to more of my games. Maybe he will. Maybe. We'll see. (horn honks) (tires squeal, engine rumbles) Seriously, you guys, we need to work out. So I'm about to get a tan before we leave... (howling) Look, it's three mamacitas. Hola, senoritas! Hola, senors! La comida aqui. Hand it over. Why are you wearing those big-ass pants to the beach? Hey, baby. They're right here! (laughing) Bam! Nice! Ooh, nice legs, Monster! All right, are we gonna stand here chitchatting withla gringasor are we gonna get our sweat on? I'm gonna get my sweat on. I don't know about y'all... So, is this workout closed or can anyone join in? It's free, man. Can you keep up? Can you? Let's go. How 'bout y'all watch our stuff? Don't be eating our food till we get back 'cause we're gonna need that. Okay... Come on, y'all. Let me see what you got. I found my Easter bunny. (laughing): Yeah, what's up? ? ? (singing in Spanish) ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (lively indistinct conversation) Second play, guys, I think we should run our middle more, that way we can fake their blocks. What do you guys think about that? Yo, ma, you got a nice little view out here. You know, little garden and everything. You should see the view from my window. You know what I see? What? SC. Shut up. That is so awesome. I guess. It's like four blocks away from my house. Feels like a million miles away, though. Remember what your dad used to say. "It's as close as you want it to be." Exactly. So what we gotta do is kick butt and win some games. (audience cheering) (squealing): Yeah! You ladies come a long way. But to get to the state finals, we gotta go through the regionals-- and those girls are tough. There's only one way we can get there-- as a team. And that's what we are now-- a team. You gotta feel the love. GIRLS (laughing): Feel the love! Feel the love! GIRLS: Feel the love. Feel the love! Feel it! Give me a lap! (whooping) Come on, ladies! The regionals are Sunday! Let's go! Coach, I'm not feeling the love at all. You guys, guess who got into Stanford! (squealing, cheering) Lettie! Oh, my God! How did she get in? She's got a 4.3. Is that your new boy toy? He's a lot less trouble than a real one. (mocking gibberish) Hey, have you heard anything about that scholarship from SC? Uh-uh. Me, either. Have you seen our new highlight reel? (scoffs) Yeah, like I could afford that. What do you care? You don't need a scholarship to go to school. My dad says, "If they don't pay you, they won't play you." Becca. Becca, wait up. You know, you can habla espanol all you want to, but I'm here to tell you that you'll never be one of them. All they do is laugh behind your back. What is your problem? Don't ask what my problem is. You know what it is-- you don't return my phone calls, you don't text me anymore. I'm feeling that you're having too much fun with your new friends. (Latin music plays) (man singing in Spanish) ? ? (whooping) (music resumes) Dag, my feet are killing me. What's your problem? What, you too good to dance with us? No, I just dance too good. Okay. I thought Lauren was the one with the 'tude-- but, actually, she's okay. Well, since we're sharing, there's something you have to hear on your new best friend's cell phone. What's that? Feel the love. ARTIE (on phone): Hey, Lauren, what's up? This is Artie. I was just thinking about you. Had a good time dancing with you last night. I like the way you move... She's outside waiting for you. What the hell are you doing with her? What difference does it make? Remember? You dumped me. Oh, Gabby, listen. Look, you don't even start with me, you backstabbing bitch. What, you got close to me so you could steal my boyfriend? I'm not your boyfriend. Shut up. You told me you guys broke up. We did! The two of you disgust me. I can't believe her. What's up, Cathedral? Y'all ready to party? (crowd cheers) I can't hear. I said, y'all ready to party? CROWD: Yeah! If you are say "yeah, yeah." CROWD: Yeah, yeah! One more time. Yeah! All right, here's what we're gonna do. If you wanna hear us play, then I wanna see you sway. Take your hands in the air and move 'em like you just don't care. And if you're feeling the heat and you wanna move your feet, then let's kick it with a phat beat. Let's kick it. (rap music playing) (cheering) Nice set. Come on! Come on! Come on! (cheering) What is she doing? Becca get your head in the game! Focus! ? ? Help! Come on! I called help. I called for the ball. Well, did you get to the ball? You were supposed to be moving your feet to the ball. No, you should stop talking all that yap, yap, yap. Don't be putting your hand in my face. I'm sick of you. Somebody get her up off me. Oh, my God. Time out! Time out! ANNOUNCER: Time out Phantoms. What's wrong with you guys? Go to the bench, man. Yeah, go to the bench. You, too, man! I'm sick of this! Quiet! Nobody's talking in this huddle but me. What's going on out there? You guys acting like the Bad News Bears, man! Yeah, well you don't mess with somebody else's boyfriend. The last time I checked, they're not together anymore. Artie, Artie, they're fighting over you, man. Who's the king of the jungle now, man? King Artie! King Artie! (mimics cat yowling) Both of y'all need to grow up, a'ight? Come on. Now squash this romance novel stuff and get out there and play! You guys are better than this, man! Focus! On three. One, two, three. ALL (weakly): Together. Hey, Gabby. Look who's over there. And she's taping. This could be your highlight reel. What do you care? SC already has your reel. You think I wanna look bad on yours? Are you twoestupidas gonna blow your chance at college over some guy? I ain't. ANNOUNCER: Point for the Phantoms! Come on, baby. They now lead 14 to 12 in the final game. ANNOUNCER: Out of bounds. The Phantoms win. (loud, sustained cheering) Next stop, the state finals! Oh, my God. Doesn't it feel so good? Yes, it feels amazing. We've got to win state 'cause I have to know what that feels like. Becca, I need to talk to you before you go home. Becca, you have more natural ability than anybody on this team. You won't even use it. You ever wonder why you're not starting? Yeah, because Gabby's your go-to girl? No, it's because I play players who play and who love this game. You don't want it. Yes, I do. Do you? What do you want to do? You know what? I don't know what I want. Look, I know your father's a big-time basketball star and has his own shoe. But you've gotta find out what does Becca want. What do you want to do? You stay on your game and I'll stay on mine. When this is all over, we'll see who gets custody of the other boy. Deal. I just had to hear it from the coach because of you. Excuse me? Yeah, you're trash. You're never going to college. Look at your hair. Don't touch me! Hey! Stop it! Hey, break it up! Break it up! You're going down. Nobody's going anywhere. Tell your girl don't touch me. Break it up. Whatever. She's going down. What's wrong with you guys? Why are you accusing us? You think we started this? You know us better than that. I don't care who started it. Stop it! You guys fight more than a hockey team. Go on home. That way. What is this, gangster volleyball? I need a football team. All right, check it out, baby. The question that's undubitably marinating around here is will Cathedral High, last year's Cinderella story, become this year's sequel success. Coach Harlan could actually jump-start a dynasty with a second state championship. And the Phantoms could write their own checks to a great college career and buy some more of that great bling bling that we all love. Now listen up, guys. This could be the dream team we have all been waiting for, but they'll have to battle through some contentious contenders. You guys have to know that they're the team to (beat-boxing) beat. You was hungry? I was thirsty. ANNOUNCER: We're still 30 minutes away from the opening serve in today's semifinal between LA's Phantoms and the San Francisco Cougars. As a matter of fact, here come the Cathedral High ladies now to begin their warmups. Listen, don't bounce like bad checks, 'cause it's gonna be off the Richter scale. COACH: Hey, ladies! How we doing? I guess I'm talking to myself. I guess I'm talking to myself. Ladies. (all shouting) Ah, that's my ladies. Feel good? Feel good! Hey, baby girl. What's up? All right, ladies. Okay, Gabby, set four. Set four. Set four. Set four. Set four. Hey, are you okay? What she doing? Are you cool? Suddenly, I feel a little sick. I feel a little sick. Do you think you can play through? Yeah, I can play through. Okay. Try it again. Come on, Gabby. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Set four. Set four. Set four. All right, right here. Ow! Hello?! Is anybody in there? That hurt. GABBY: This is warm-up. Get used to it. What the hell was that? Gabby-- what's wrong with her? I don't know. I don't know. What the hell was that? Hmm? What the hell was that? What you mean? You all right? Yeah, yeah. I'm good. I'm good. All right. Get your head in the game. Let's go. Focus. Come on, baby. All right, guys. Come on. Let's do this. Yeah, let's go. Yeah, come on, Gabby. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Set four. Set four. Set four. Oh, hello. They're not playing. We're playing in here. What is that? Was she like that this morning? No, of course not. You could've hit that. Gabby, hit the bench. Becca, you're in for Gabby. What's your problem? Gabby, hit the bench. Becca, you're in for Gabby. What? Looks like you're out and I'm in. Coach, what are you talking about? You can't do this. You can't do that. COACH: Hit the bench. Na. I'm good. Come on. Hit the bench. You, hit the bench. Get off the court. Get off the court. Coach, you can't do this! I just... Coach, take over. What's wrong with you? Are you on drugs? What are you talking about? Why you acting... What's wrong with you? I'm trying to play. You don't want me to play out there. I see this. This is my game! I've worked my ass off for this team! Gabby, calma. Por favor, calma, Gabby. Don't touch my face. Don't... Don't touch my face. Lettie, take Gabby to the locker. Your father would be real proud of you right now. Don't talk about my father! You know better than to... Don't, don't... Gabby! Stop it. Stop it. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Stop it, Gabby. GABBY: Don't touch me. LETTIE: Come on, Gabby. GABBY: Don't touch me! Look, I'm getting back in the game! Nah, I'm not gonna take you out the game. I'm gonna take you off the team. You're off the team. Hit the locker room! Hit the locker room! Don't do this to me. You can't do this to me. You're off the team. You can't... Hit the lockers. You're off the team. Whatever. All right, ladies, come on! Go get her. COACH: All right, ladies, come on, let's go! Come on, Becca, let's go! (bang) (sobbing) Gabby. Are you okay? What happened? Yourtios,your tias, tu familia, they're all worried about you. Hay no me importa. Creo que te importa? All I want... is mypapihere watching me play. I know. Come here. ROSA: Gabby, are you all right? Abuela! What happened? (sobbing) I have to play. I've got to, I got to play. No, no, Gabby. Everything's gonna be okay. We're gonna stay with you till the game's over. Yes, we're staying with you. Hey, you need anything? Yeah, go get some ice. Toda esta bien, mi angelito. Yo estoy aqui contigo. (sobbing) Mijita... mijita, no senti. ANNOUNCER: Cathedral High wins and goes to the state finals! (crowd cheers) Gabby, we won and we're going to the finals! Yes, we won. We won, baby girl. We won. Come on, baby, it's party time! ? I stepped in da party like WOO ? ? What's da deal wit it? ? ? Ain't no hands in da air unless its a drink wit it ? ? Honeys love it cus they know I rock da bells in here ? ? Thugs wit me cus they know I roll wit kells and dem ? ? Then I spot mami shakin' like a tambourine ? ? Wanna eat it just like a jelly bean ? ?

DJ keeps spinnin da cuts ? ? Ladies drop it like its hot, cus we up in here tonite... ? Excuse me. Becca, can I speak to you for a second? I'll be back. Have you seen Gabby? No. I'm really worried about her. I can't believe she took drugs. She didn't. What do you mean? I took pills out of my mother's purse and poured it into Gabby's water. What?! Becca, are you nuts? Why would you do that? Well, at least I didn't take her boyfriend. Don't even go there. I'm sorry. Gabby took my spot and blew my chance of my father coming to see me play on this team. Becca, I didn't know it affected you that way. But it does not justify what you did. ? ? ? ? ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, senores y senoritas, welcome to the Women's State Volleyball Championships! It is going to be exciting here tonight. Did they get bigger? ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready?! It's time for the main event: the final match for the state volleyball championship! ANNOUNCER: All right, ladies and gentlemen, playing tonight for the state championship top-seeded Mother of Mercy, that girl looks... I'm sorry. Mother of Mercy takes on California's Cathedral High! (crowd cheers) Come on, baby. Come on. (whistle blows) ANNOUNCER: And you can just feel the intensity in the building rising. Fans are at the edge of their seats. It's about to be a war zone up in here, so get your sword and shield ready, 'cause it's no-holds-barred tonight. We're off! ANNOUNCER: Another error by Cathedral High in this fifth and final game! The Phantoms have dug themselves into a deep hole. Woo! Trailing 11 to four. They need this right now, because they're hanging in the balance. And when I say hanging, I'm talking about Judas Iscariot, baby! Hanging in the balance! You can see the concern on the Phantoms faces. This state championship could be slipping away. Ball's up to set. It's a smash by Kaitlan! ANNOUNCER: What a spike! Incredible! Incredible! Third in a row, ticktacktoe! ANNOUNCER: Another smash by Lauren McDonald! I got it! I got it! Espinosa with the set. Score by the Phantoms! They now lead 12 to 11. What a comeback! Mark it down. Mark it down. ANNOUNCER: Wait, wait, wait, wait. A late call by the back linesman. He's ruled the ball out. He's ruled it out! The call is gonna stand, That was in! That was in! which means the point is taken away from the Phantoms. And Mother of Mercy now leads 12 to 11. Wait a minute. Stop everything. The Phantoms have called time out. Are we champions? ALL: Yes! Are we champions?! ALL: Yes! Give me one reason why we should win this thing? Because this is the last time any of us will ever play together. Last time some of us will ever play at all. Gabby? I can't imagine it ending any other way. And if we win, my parents are gonna take me to Tahiti. (all groan) Just for a week. COACH: One, two, three! ALL: Lose it back! Hey, you got nine. I got her. She ain't got nothing on me. All right. You better strap on a jet pack if you want to get more air than me. You want a manicure to go with that facial? ANNOUNCER: Wow, what an amazing play by Gabby Espinosa, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, no, she didn't. ALL: Oh, yes, she did. ALL: Hola!Say what, say what? Watch us kick your butt. The Phantoms are celebrating, but it's a long way to 15. And they've got to win by deuce.

And Gabby de la Cruz Gonzales Guadalupe Mayor Rodrigues Reyes Espinosa with an incredible play, ladies and gentlemen. What an amazing comeback, ladies and gentlemen. The little school that could is doing it again. In a spectacular show of artwork, teamship, the Phantoms are one point away from pulling off a shocker, coming back from a seven point deficit. COACH: Defense. Defense. Defense. ANNOUNCER: She sets it up. I got it. I got it. Oh! Espinosa stumbles, can't get... Oh! And the point goes to Mother of Mercy as Gabby Espinosa can't get there in time. Mother of Mercy's not going to give it away that easy, folks. And Cathedral High's got problems. Time out! I got it. ANNOUNCER: Whoa, there's an injured player on the court. Let's see what's going on over there. Lauren. Lauren, come here, baby. Here's what we got to do. You got to go down... Dad, you're fired.

We need to close the seam. You're doing good out there, ladies. But, Lettie, we need you to set for Gabby. Okay... BECCA: I'll watch her. Thank you, Becca. Guess I can't stay a bitch forever. Gabby, I want to say to you that I'm sorry for what I did. I was angry... I wasn't that nice to you, either. Come here. I missed you. Enough of the mushy mushy stuff. Now we came to do what we do best and what is that, ladies? ALL: Kick ass! Let's do it. guys. That's what I'm talking about. Let's go! ANNOUNCER: I can see that they've come out re-energized.
