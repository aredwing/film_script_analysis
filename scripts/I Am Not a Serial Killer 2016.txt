That's two bodies in a week, that's money in the bank. -Don't even joke like that, John. You okay here? -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. -It stinks really bad. - She. -She stinks really bad. -She does smell for a woman. Wish someone had found her sooner. Leg. Turn your head. Oh, Ron's getting lazier. He didn't even clean her. He just declared natural causes and shipped her over. Other leg. Aneurysm hooks. How's school? - I mean, you know, aunt Margaret it's it's the first week, nothing much really happens. -Make any new friends? - It's funny, actually. All those kids that I've gone to school with since kindergarten.. ...they all left, so...They're all new kids and they all wanted to be friends with me. And it was pretty sweet. Who are you? My name is John. - And welcome back to Clayton's wxpc it's just about the top of the hour. Some startling new developments on a story we've been following for the last 48 hours. The death of a Clayton man, Jeb jolly, aged 53 is now under police investigation. The local mechanics body was found yesterday by one woman who likened the violent scene to quote, "a bizarre animal attack." Clayton county police department have declined to comment, citing the need for an official coroner's report. Jolly's family asking only for our prayers. -Hey, principal Layton wants to see you. -Mrs. cleaver, take a seat please. John, adolescence can be a difficult time. It's normal to be interested in the world and all of its problems. Normal to be drawn to death and murder. But unfortunately you can go too far down that road. Too far away from.. Well, normal thoughts. -What do you say, John? -I'm interested in how many times you felt it was necessary to say the word "normal." - It's not like there's a whole lot to say about Einstein. I mean, he discovered e equals mc square and nuclear bombs but that's it. I'm lucky I got half a page at all. -And you missed two points for length you missed another two for spelling. I mean, you managed to spell Einstein a different way every time. -That's creativity. -No, that's remarkable. That's amazing. -Hoo! Say, you guys, uh you guys catch that smell? Smells of something dead. Something rotting. Freak. -So, what psycho did you write about? -Dennis rader, uh, the, uh, btk killer. That's how he signed all of his letters to the media as "bind, torture, kill." -How many people did he kill? -Maybe 10, they're not, not sure but could be more. - Only 10? The guy you wrote about last year was way better at it. - Jeffrey dahmer. He was a cannibal and he kept severed heads in his freezer. - I remember your pictures now. They gave me nightmares. -Nightmares are nothin' man. Those pictures gave me a therapist. -Oh, what up? That black cloud above ya's growing. -I broke one of my rules. -Stalking anybody? -No. -What else? -Have you heard about the MacDonald triad? -Three traits shared by 95 percent of all serial killers bedwetting, pyromania, animal cruelty. You do admit I have all three. -What really gets me is.. ...you know, a -- animal cruelty predicts violent behavior.. ...but until I read that i -- I didn't think it was wrong...You know. -What else? -Well, if I -- I -- I.. If I'm thinking about hurting a person then.. ...you know, I'll just give them a compliment. If somebody's really bugging me to the point where.. ...when I think about killing them then.. ...I'll just, I'll just smile and I'll say something nice...You know? Is that hot chocolate? -Uh-huh. -I'm good. -John, you have a -- a lot of predictors for serial killer behavior but predictors are just that, they predict what might happen, not what will happen. You're in control of your own destiny. You're a good person, John. That's important. -Hey, John? -Yeah, Mr. crowley? -Come here. What do you know about smartphones? -Uh, I don't know. What do you, what do you need? -I want to send my wife a kiss. -You want to send her a kiss? - You're supposed to be able to take photos and send them to each other. -Alright, um.. - Show me how it's done. -Well, so, it's that button. -Uh-huh. -And then.. ...you can use this one to take the picture, so.. -Oh, oh.. -Here you go. Okay. And there you go. -Good lord, she's gonna be in shock that's for sure. -Brooke? Come on down, dinner's ready. -Relax, he's dead. He's going nowhere fast. -Is that Jeb jolly? -Oh-ho, yes. Hey.. ...you surviving? -Uh.. Are you? - I'm not the one who has to live with mom. You heard from dad? -No. You? -Rarely. I ask him for money sometimes. -John? -Yeah? -Dr. neblin told me. -What? -That you think you're going to kill somebody. -That's funny, 'cause that's not what I said. What I said was that, i follow very strict rules to keep me from doing anything wrong. Seems like you'd be happy about that. -Happy.. ...is not a son who has to follow rules to keep himself from killing people happy is not a psychologist telling me my son is a sociopath. -He actually said that? That's kinda cool. -Antisocial-- -hate to dump this on you this time of night, April. It's a hell of a thing. -I think the damage is done, mom. -What dive are you heading to tonight? -Somewhere with more living people then here that's for sure. Have fun. - Oh, for the love of Mike. - I call organs. - Fine. -Dang it, Ron. - What? -Well, we're missing a kidney. I've gone through the bag twice. You think Ron would manage to send us all the organs for crying out loud. -Well.. What if the person who killed him took it? -That's.. - It's totally possible. Look at that. - It'll be on the forms. - I don't think so. Oh, wait, here. "Left kidney removed via incisions to renal artery, veins and ureter." -So he had it removed? -No, there's no record of that, it's just not there. - This is Ted rath, live at the scene where the ambulance has just left and as you can see the police and a crowd are gathering here in Clayton a normally peaceful town, where a killer has struck possibly for the second time leaving a dead body and a terrified town in his wake. -Stupid, stupid, the last thing this town needs is panic about a mass murderer. -I think the last thing we need are the killings. -Now details are sketchy at this time what I have been able to ascertain is there was a small pool of oil or some black sludge found near the body of local farmer, Dave byrd. We will, of course, be giving you details as they become available. This is a 5 live news exclusive. Death stalks America's heartland. -Okay, so the first question of psychological profiling is what's the killer doing he doesn't absolutely have to be doing? -Dude, I think it's a werewolf. -It's not a werewolf. -Dude, did you see the news? It has the intelligence of man with the ferocity of a beast. What is that supposed to be? -It's not a werewolf. Werewolves aren't real. The stories of them probably started from serial killers, you know. Vampire's too. It's just men who hunt and kill other men. So assuming a basic goal of trying to kill somebody. All you really need to do is shoot them, right? -Yeah. -So what's he doing that he doesn't have to do? -Well, he's s -- stabbing him, rippin' into him. -Exactly, yeah, that's the, that's the first thing, you know. He approaches 'em in person. Probably means he wants to be close to the victims. What else? -He attacked during the night, in the dark. -I think that's probably just something he had to do. -Doesn't that count for your list? -I mean, it's, it's not a unique trait. Nobody who kills somebody else wants to be seen. -Just put it on your list, i mean.. ...not everything in this has to be your idea. Ted Bundy.. ...the one that they, uh.. ...they coined the term serial killer for. He said that after you killed somebody.. You know, if you had enough time with them. They could be whoever you wanted them to be. - You're weird man. -I hate Halloween. It's absurd, you know. This is the, this is the night when evil spirits are supposed to walk the earth. You know, druids burning kids in wicker baskets, you know. -My position is vulnerable out here, boys let's stay alert and keep moving. -Can't you just tell him to go away? -Nah, leave him alone. He's convinced the killer is gonna come out and get us. Plus, it makes him happy. Right, dad? - Let's just hurry up and get the hell outta here. - Dad, you said we could stay out till 9:30. - Trick or treat? -You boy's shouldn't be out this late. -Yeah. It's not safe with a killer out there. -That's what I'm saying. - You boys be careful. -Are you it? -Am I what? -The clown from "it," that Stephen king book. -No. I was thinking about dressing up as my mother but I was worried what my therapist would say. -You gonna juggle for us, freak? -That's a really clever costume. You know, it looks great. It's really inventive and the the bullet hole looks...Really authentic. -You know this is a party for normal people? Right? So why don't you go home to your undertaking slut of a mother. Alright? What are you smiling about? -I've been clinically diagnosed with sociopathy, rob. To me, you're an object. You know, you're a, you're a thing. You're about as important to me as a cardboard box. And the -- the thing about cardboard boxes.. ..Is that.. You know they're totally boring on the outside, right? But...Sometimes, if you cut 'em open there'll be something interesting inside. You know, and so, while you're saying all these boring things to me I'm thinking about what it'd be like to cut you open. But I -- I don't wanna, i don't wanna be that person. And so, I have a rule that anytime somebody says something to me where I -- I think about, you know, cuttin' 'em. I -- I -- I just smile and I say something nice. So that's why I say to you rob Anders of 232, carnation street. You are a really great guy. -You're a freak. -You're not a freak. - John. What is this? -It's.. -John.. ...wash up and get out. -Mom, it's -- it's not.. -I should be stronger with you. This is my fault. -Mom, there -- there should be something missing. -Go, John. -There should be an organ missing to fit the profile. -Go! This door will be locked in future! -Who told you? -He told a school counselor, who told me. Lucky for you, she didn't tell principal Layton. Apparently you gave him nightmares, John. -Rob Anders is a bully. - Doesn't mean you can threaten to kill him. -I, I didn't. -And then there's what happened in the mortuary. What is it? What set you off? -It all just feels so close. This is, this is nowhere. It isn't supposed to happen here it's supposed to be somewhere else, you know. -Okay. Let me ask you this. Who were you talking to just before rob Anders upset you? -Oh, it was just some girl. - She have a name? - Her, her name is Brooke. -Cute? -Little young for you, doctor. -Yes. Barrow's goldeneye. Come here. Have a look at this. Here. Straight over there. Have a look. Do you see it? -Oh.. Yeah. A duck. -That's a very rare duck. So don't go killin' it. I haven't seen one in over 5 years. Actually you can see the eyes, they're very beautiful more Amber really than gold. It catches the light, no matter where they are. Exceptional. - Hey, you fishing? -Huh? -Are you goin' fishing? -Ice fishing. - Do you need a hand with that stuff there? Let me just...Take that off your hands. Yeah, I used to go fishing all the time up north. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah, my uncle has a cabin.. -Oh, good. -Oh, yeah. Yeah, you mind if I come along? -Uh, well.. -How far off you going? -Well, far enough. You're gonna need a -- a hat out there though, right? -Uh.. ...i bought you a hat. - Here. We're not gonna tell your mom about this, okay? Right now she is simultaneously trying to stuff a Turkey and wipe away tears. -She's crying? -Uh-huh. Mother of all blow ups yesterday with Lauren who's now not coming to Thanksgiving dinner tonight. That leaves you and me, sport. Go and wash. I need you to come out of your head for a couple hours, okay? Give her a hand.. ...make her realize she still has one loving child left. Or at least pretend. -Urgh! -Oh, I had to stop by Ron's for that file he forgot and he, uh, he told me a joke. You wanna hear it? -Sure. - What's small and grey and screws in the walls? -I don't know.. John, can you scoot across to the watsons and ask bev for some vanilla? -Uh.. Yeah, sure. - Keep it up you loser. - Hi, John. -Uh, vanilla. -Vanilla? -Uh, yeah, vanilla. -Vanilla, like, ice cream? -Um, you know, I'm not, I'm not really sure. Mom just said we needed some. -Here you go, John. It's for cooking. - This is Ted rath with an update on the Clayton killer situation. Now this reporter has discovered there is an Emmet t. Openshaw an Arizona man who disappeared from his home 42 years ago. He was 30 at the time. Police found signs of struggle but there was no body found at the scene. Now the reason this crime connects to what's happening here in Clayton county is they found a similar pile of black oil at the crime scene. - Good morning, Mrs. crowley, I'm up and I thought I could shovel your steps for you. Good morning, Kay. It snowed so I could shovel your drive if you like, uh.. Good morning, Mrs. crowley. Good morning, Mrs. crowley. -John? -Um.. Hi, uh, the snow. I thought I'd.. -Well, that would be very nice. Thank you. -Sure thing. - Ah, it's a beautiful day, John. Makes you glad to be alive. -Here you go, John. Hot chocolate, your favorite. -Thank you. -Every single time. Where are they? -Your forehead, dear. -Takes the lungs.. ...takes the kidney.. ...took an arm. What next? -Uh.. -Okay. -Yeah. - We begin with tonight's top story the FBI has confirmed a positive DNA match between that of the Clayton county murders and Emmet t. Openshaw the Arizona man who disappeared in 1971. Details are coming in, and the investigation is ongoing. -That is some little woman you got there, bill. -Oh, yeah. - Oh, by the way she had to go powder her nose. Oh, hey, I hope you don't mind if I, uh take her for another spin. -Oh, no, no, no. -I got some energy left. -Good. -Well, here's to ya. Oop, there's Kay. You don't mind, huh? Take care now. - Uh.. Ah! -Thank you. Hey.. Eat you own plate. - John? -I can't believe you followed me. -I can't believe you were having dinner with my therapist. -Don't be silly, John. Grant and I meet sometimes to discuss your progress a progress I am failing to appreciate right now. -Did I interrupt a date? Is that even ethical? -It's, it's just the first right up ahead. Thanks, April. Actually John's doing okay. -He is? -I am? -Sure, tonight for example you were concerned for your mother with a killer in town. -You really believe that I followed mom because I was worried for her? -You may be lacking in empathy, John but you should recognize a life line when it's thrown at you. -Hi, John. Hi, John! -Hey. -Extra work? -Oh, it's, it's just a project. -Serial killers...Fairies.. ...witchcraft...Folktales. That's an interesting combination. Need any help? -No, I'm, I'm fine. -Okay. - Pretty good job, if I do say so myself. Hey, Tommy, you look downright dangerous. -Thanks. Goodnight, Greg. - Alright. Okay, bill. You're up next. Let's go. Oh, boy. Too much dancing the other night, huh? Yeah, well, we'll...Get you looking real good for the next time out, okay? You need a crane there? So.. Boy, it's been a while, hasn't it? You -- you -- you want something fancy today? -Let's do the...Usual. -The usual? Alright. Hang tight. These things have to be done delicately. Oh, Jesus. Uh, hang on a second, I'll -- I'll get a.. I gotta get another scissors here. I'll be right back, alright. Won't be a moment. -Fuck. - Police department. -Well, I guess we better take a look around. -Oh, no, uh.. They didn't come through here. - Tom, check this out. There's something in here. -Uh.. Yes, my dear. Flour? Uh, whole.. Whole grain? Oh, good. Yes, I'll, uh.. I love you too. - This is Ted rath coming to you live from Clayton county where as you can see tempers are flaring dangerously. We are at the home of local barber Greg Olson. Olson was the owner of the premises where the two policemen were found dead earlier this week sparking this outrage. Let's see if we can get a word from one of these concerned citizens. Excuse me, sir, sir, sir! What to do you hope to accomplish with this? -Uh, well, as you can see, people are angry and -- and -- and things are getting out of hand. -What is your name, sir? -Um, Roger Bowen, uh, this is my son, Max. This is his bat. He left it at school. Uh, listen, people are upset and, uh we should really.. Calm down, everybody! This is no way to handle this situation. -Thank you all for coming. I think everybody here is concerned about the safety of our streets. We have got to stick together. There is a killer in our town. I look at all these faces and I.. I don't want to lose a single one of you. Beverly made some bars, and some coffee. It's on the table. Help yourself, folks. And...Take care of each other. Help yourself. -How's bill? -Oh, I'm worried about him. He's not feeling well. And he's so, oh, down in the dumps. Uh, he can get that way. It's a winter thing. But he hasn't been out of the house in over a week. -He hasn't been out at all? -Oh, hi, John. No. It's almost like he's afraid. I think he's worried about slipping on the ice or something. John? Why don't you go see him? He'd like that. -Hi, John. -Hey, Brooke. -You want some juice or hot chocolate? -His stomach is bothering him. Do you think I could get him to go to the doctor? -Or you could try this one. Mixture of rat poisoning and metal filings. -Oh, thank you. - Good to see you there. "On what wings dare he aspire?" -What? -"What the hand.. ...dare seize the fire?" Just a poem. "Tyger, tyger burning bright "in the forests of the night "what immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry?" The poet.. ...is asking the tiger who made him and how. William Blake. He wrote two poems like that. "The lamb" and "the tyger." One who was made of sweetness and love and one was forged from terror and death. "When the stars threw down their Spears "and watered heaven with their tears. "Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the lamb make thee?" -Hi, Mr. crowley. Hi, how are you? How are you? How's your leg? Can I kill you? - And how is school? -It's fine. Everybody's afraid but...That's pretty normal. -And are you afraid? -No. Fear is a really weird thing. You know, people are, people are afraid of things but they're never afraid of their own actions. Well, it's -- it's like that woman right there. You know, she, she could be afraid of getting hit by a car. But she isn't afraid of crossing the street, you know? She's done it before. It should be pretty easy. She just waits until she can't see any cars and cross out carefully onto the ice. She's gonna do everything she can to keep herself safe. And there, there she goes. She's fine. She made it. -He refuses to go to the doctor. -Oh, stop it woman. I'll be alright. Alright. Lower the seat and the cover. Oh. Oh. Well, that's better. You've been a big help to me and Kay this winter, John. Seems like a dying thing. Neighbors helping neighbors. - Alright, I've got you. I've got you. -Oh. Ah. I worry about her, John. I can't leave her here alone. I can't face that. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Anything else in the car? - Ah, just the salad but Lauren's bringing that up. -She's really here? How'd you do it? I invited her, like, five times couldn't get a yes out of her. -We had a really good talk last night. And I think her boyfriend dumped her. -Oh. Quick, we're not set for four run down and get another chair for the table and I will set another plate. Margaret, you're wonderful. -I know. What would you do without me? John? Chair, downstairs, bring up now. -Hey, John. Hey, is she in a good mood? -She's probably slaughtering a goat in your honor. -We'll see how long that lasts. Stick close, okay? I might need backup. -Very useful, John. -Mm-hmm. -Guess it makes a change from soap. -You are gonna be so cool. -Yeah. -Okay. Here, open these, both of you. From your dad. -You, first. Out loud. - Shh. Just let him read it. -It's okay. "Hey, tiger, merry Christmas. "You're gonna love this mp3 player. "Filled it up with all of our favorite music "the stuff we used to sing together. "It's like having a dad in your pocket. "See you around. Sam cleaver." -Do you even remember those old tunes? -Sam used to play them to John in the car. You'd always be singing together. -Shit. -Damn it, Sam. -It's empty. -I'm sorry. He can't even buy your love without screwing it up. - Hey, John, it's no big deal. He got me a DVD of some kid show apparently, we used to watch it together. I've no recollection of it. -So, what? It just means he's a dick to you too. -Let's have dessert. I -- two different pies. Whipped cream.. - Hello? Who's there? -I sent you the note. Shit. - Leave me alone. You know so much about me then you know what I'll do when I find you. -Shit. - I said-- -does that hurt? You cut off your own leg. You -- you pulled out your lungs I just wanna know if it hurts. Nothing you do makes sense. You -- you -- you hide some bodies you -- you don't hide others, you're not consistent. I -- I -- I just wanna know does it hurt? - It hurts.. ...like hell. It hurts every time. -Do you have to, do you have to wait? Like, eh, do you have to wait for something to -- to break down? What about Emmett? Uh, e -- e -- Emmett openshaw in -- in Arizona? Where, what did you, what did you steal from him? - I stole his life. He would have had a long one I think. As long as his at least. He would have gotten married and had kids. You still don't know, do you? Hang on. I've taken more lives than you can ever guess. But the mechanic was the first one I didn't keep. -What was that? - What was what? - What was that noise? -Hey, John. So, what have you been up to? I barely seen you since the holidays. What does a young psychotic John Wayne cleaver do in his spare time? Hello? Earth to John. Wanna tell me what the craps going on, man? - Uh. -Uh. It's nothing, um.. I just.. I need to do normal stuff right now. Umm. Do you wanna play the game? -Why are you here, John? On Christmas night, when I haven't seen you in not one week, but two weeks? - I'm -- I'm just kinda losing it. - Losing what? - I'm losing it. I'm -- I'm -- I'm breaking all my rules. - What rules? -I have rules to keep me normal and to keep everybody else safe. One -- one of my rules is that i need to hang out with you because we do normal stuff. Um, and I -- I need that. -So, we've been friends for three years 'cause you think it makes your normal? -Eh, yeah. Get off of him! He's not yours. -John. John? Don't you think we should talk? -Talk about what? -I know this is difficult. I -- I can't imagine what you must be going through but, you -- you've barely said a word to me in days. -I've barely said a word to you since fourth grade. -Then maybe we should start. -Dr. neblin -- -Dr. neblin needs to shut up. - He -- he's just trying to help you. We, we all just wanna do what's best for you. Just tell me what you're feeling. -What don't you get? I don't feel anything. Okay? I don't -- I don't give a shit that Max's dad is dead! I don't give a shit that you could be next! -John, I'm so sorry. -John, please. -Stop! -I just wanna -- -no, shut up, shut up! You shut up! -John. John, I won't come in. I just wanna say something. Last night was.. But we're still together, right? I mean, we're still a family. Because it's all we got. I thought you helping as embalm was bad for you but I think now maybe I was wrong. I don't know. All I do know is you've gotten worse since I stopped you and yet that was where i felt closest to you so...If that's what it takes for us to stay together then that's what we do. - Let's say that you're the kind of person who, uh, you know, you leave when things get bad. You've done it a lot. Uh, you make a life, you always get into trouble and then you always run away. Now, things are bad. They're worse than they've ever been but you don't leave, you stay. Why would you do that? - You're talking about risk and reward. Stay and bare the hardship or escape with the cost of losing something. Is there something you wanna tell me? -No, I just want your opinion. What would make you stay? -Am I a sociopath? -It's not me. -I never said it was. But I need to know because I need to understand if I'm answering from an emotional point of view or not. -What's the difference? - It's everything. You say I can up and leave but I have to ask myself what it is I'm leaving. What emotional connection is being broken. Now, if I'm a sociopath then it might not bother me but if I'm not.. -Love. -Love, yes. An emotional connection like love. -Okay. Thank you. -Wait, wait, John, hold on, hold on. Alright, look, call me if there's anything you need day or night. -Yeah, okay. Can I look at that one? What's the, what's the range on something like that? -I don't know, like, 2 to 3 miles. -Okay. How much can I get for that? -I don't know, like, 20 to 30 bucks. -Hi, Mrs. c. -Oh, hello, John. - I can help you with that. -Thanks. -So, uh, how's bill? - Oh, not so well, John. It's his heart. Just his age, John. Everything is catchin' up with him. -Pills, pills. My whole existence has become pills. Damn this body of mine, damn. - No! -Stop it. Shh. Shh. Stop it! Just stop, stop! Shh! Shh! - Hello. -I've -- I've done it. It's too late. - John, where are you? -I'm -- I'm on the edge and.. ...I'm over it and I'm falling. - Listen to me, John. -I didn't wanna do it. - Listen to me, listen. -It's too late. - No, John, it's not too late. You're in control. Are you listening? -Yes. - Now, listen. You're not a killer, you're a good person, John whatever you've done we can get through it. We can make it right again. Are you still listening? -Thank you. I need to go. - No, John, don't hang up. Tell me where you are. -No. Thank you for your help. -Mary Jean, put that back! -Oh! Come back. Come back and die with your own heart. Look at your phone! Look at your phone! You're not gonna kill anybody. You can't have his heart. -Photoshop? -Yeah. -Sweet. - We are gathered here today to celebrate the life and mourn the passing of Roger Bowen. It is fitting that we do so here surrounded by all those who loved and admired him. Great evil has befallen our town and many families are in mourning today. Roger was a husband and a father. He was a friend to all. He was a pillar of our community. He was a pillar of his church. And he was a pillar in his own household. But before you think I'm building some kind of Greek temple with all them pillars Roger's about as down to earth a guy as you'd ever wanna know. Steadfast, honest, hardworking. The kind of man who's character embodies the values that a community is all about. -You attacked my wife. -You murdered my therapist. -That's what he was doing out there at that hour on a street carrying about in his nightgown out looking for some kid. I couldn't help him. Where is it? -How long do you think you've got? -Long enough to find another. -Not here. Not in front of everybody. -You don't know the things I've done or that I will do. -Don't forget to take the book of condolence to the cemetery, John. - The family is so grateful for all your wonderful cards and flowers and, and some of you have asked about donations. But the family would prefer any donations to be made in Roger's name to the organ donor foundation. Following his kidney replacements techniques. Thank you so much for coming out. - John? You coming? -Ah, no, I'm gonna stay behind and start cleaning stuff up. -Okay, you go with mom. -Mom already left in the hearse with Margaret. -No, she's taking her own car. She just went upstairs. -Mom? Mom? -Where have you hidden it? -It's him, not it. -I need that heart. Or any heart. -Okay? You love her? -Why do you think i stayed human all these years? -You love her? Do you think i wouldn't do it, John? After all I've done? Where is that body? Where? -It's in the freezer. -John? What is this? -It's the one that's been killing everybody. - He attacked me. Is he dead? - Mom. Not he, it. -We need to call the police. - No! Mom, listen. Listen to me. You can't do that. Mom, I tried. He killed them. Mom. Please, help me. Scissors. Turn it on. -John. It hurts. John.. Look after Kay for me. "Tyger, tyger burning bright.." - While police are waiting to release any further details all they can confirm that a potential homicide investigation is underway. Clayton county police are also looking for another man bill crowley, age 79 who disappeared the night before Dr. neblin's body was found. Local authorities are asking for anyone with information to please come forward. -Tell me about him. -About bill? I met bill, we were both in our 30s. And in those days, in this town, being 30 and single made me an old maid. He reminded me a bit of my grandfather the way he always wore a hat. He had this lust for life. I.. I set my sights on him after the first couple of weeks. One Sunday, we were having dinner at my parents' house with all my brothers and sisters and all their families and.. Bill got up and left the table. I followed him out and found him in the kitchen.. ...crying. He said, "i never got it before now, Kay." And he told me.. ...he loved me.. ...more than anything in heaven or hell. He was very romantic with his words. In his last days, he was more.. ...sickness than health. You saw the way he was. But every day he'd tell me "i will stay by your side forever." Oh, that dreaded thing. It hasn't been the same since that night. - You know, we can arrange for you to see a grief counselor if you'd like. -I think that...Seeing a psychotherapist to talk about my first therapist seems.. ...kinda disloyal. Neblin would have laughed at that. - Hit the switch, John.
