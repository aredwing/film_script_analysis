What about things That you swore to be true? What about you, Jamie? What about you? Jamie is sure something wonderful died Jamie decides it's his right to decide Jamie's got secrets he doesn't confide And I'm still hurting Go and hide And run away Run away Run and find something better Go and ride The sun away Run away Like it's simple Like it's right Give me a day, Jamie Bring back the lies Hang them back on the wall Maybe I'd see How you could be So certain that we Had no chance At all Jamie is over and where can I turn? Covered with scars I did nothing to earn Maybe there's somewhere a lesson to learn But that wouldn't change the fact That wouldn't speed the time Once the foundation's cracked And I'm Still hurting Jamie... Jamie, wait. I'm breaking my mother's heart The longer I stand looking at you The more I hear it splinter and crack From 90 miles away I'm breaking my mother's heart The JCC of Spring Valley is shaking And crumbling to the ground And my grandfather's rolling Rolling in his grave If you had a tattoo that wouldn't matter If you had a shaved head that would be cool If you came from Spain or Japan or the back of a van Just as long as you're not from Hebrew school I'd say, "Now I'm getting somewhere! I'm finally breaking through!" I'd say, "Hey! Hey! Shiksa goddess! I've been waiting for someone like you" Oh, my God! OK, hold on. Hold on. What's happening? I have to... I have to take this in. You don't understand. I have been waiting through Danica Schwartz and Erica Weiss And the Handelman twins I have been waiting through Heather Greenblatt, Annie Mincus, Karen Pincus and Lisa Katz And Stacey Rosen, Ellen Kaplan, Julie Silver and Janie Stein I've had Shabbat dinners on Friday nights With every Shapiro in Washington Heights! But the minute I first met you I could barely catch my breath I've been standing for days with the phone in my hand Like an idiot scared to death I've been wandering through the desert I've been beaten I've been hit My people have suffered for thousands of years And I don't give a shit If you had a pierced tongue that wouldn't matter If you once were in jail or you once were a man If your mother and your brother had relations with each other And your father was connected to the Gotti clan, I'd say, "Well, nobody's perfect" It's tragic but it's true I'd say, "Hey! Hey! Shiksa goddess! I've been waiting for someone like you" Breaking the circle You Taking the light You You are the story I should write I have to write! If you drove an RV that wouldn't matter If you like to drink blood I think it's cute If you've got a powerful connection to your firearm collection I'd say draw a bead and shoot I'm your Hebrew slave at your service Just tell me what to do I'd say, "Hey, hey, hey... I've been waiting for someone I've been praying for someone I think that I could be in love With someone Like you" I guess I can't believe you really came And that we're sitting on this pier See, I'm smiling That means I'm happy that you're here I stole this sweater from a costume shop It makes me look like Daisy Mae See, we're laughing I think we're gonna be OK I mean, we'll have to try a little harder And bend things to and fro To make this love as special As it was five years ago I mean you made it to Ohio Who knows where else We can go I think you're really gonna like this show I'm pretty sure it doesn't suck See, you're laughing And I'm smiling By a river in Ohio And you're mine We're doing fine I think we both can see what could be better I'll own when I was wrong With all we've had to go through We'll end up twice as strong And so we'll start again this weekend And just keep rolling along Baby, I... I'm so sorry. I can't stay this weekend. I have this stupid Random House thing, it's tomorrow. I couldn't get out. I didn't know you had to go so soon I'm so sorry, sweetheart. I thought we had a little time I know. Look, whatever If you have to Then you have to So whatever It's all right We'll have tonight Yeah... See, the thing is, I tried to get a plane ticket for tomorrow, but the only ones available were for tonight. So... you know, I can come back on Monday if you want. You know what makes me crazy? I'm sorry, can I say this? You know what makes me nuts? The fact that we could be together Here together Sharing our night Spending our time And you are gonna choose Someone else to be with No, you are I'm not... That's not true. Yes, Jamie, that's exactly what you're doing You could be here with me or be there with them As usual guess which you pick Baby, I have to go! No, Jamie, you do not have to go To another party with the same 20jerks you already know You could stay with your wife on her fucking birthday And you could, God forbid, even see my show And I know in your soul it must drive you crazy That you won't get to play with your little girlfriends - You're being crazy! - No, I'm not, no, I'm not! And the point is, Jamie That you can't spend a single day that's not about You and you and nothing but you "Mahvelous" novelist, you Isn't he wonderful? Just 28 The savior of writing You and you and nothing but you Miles and piles of you Pushing through windows and bursting through walls En route to the sky And I I swear to God I'll never understand How you can stand there straight and tall And see I'm crying And not do anything at all Yeah, hello? Yeah, this is Jamie Wellerstein. Oh, OK. Sure. Wait, who? Who told you? Wait, wait, you... you read my manuscript? But how did you... Oh, oh, yeah, Professor Adler. No, no, no, no, that's... that's great! That's... that's... That's really... It's a second draft, you know. It's... it's a work in progress, it's getting there, though. I'm sorry, who... Random House read it? Oh, my... that's... That's great. That's... Holy shit! I'm sorry... that's... no, no, no, no, no! No, no. No. OK. Yes. Yes. Yes, I'm 23. I'm...

OK. Yes, I will see you there. I am so... ...so looking... looking forward to meeting you, Ms. Whitfield. OK. OK. OK, Linda. We're like friends, Linda. Uh, OK, great. That's... that's fine. OK, bye. What?! Hi. Hey, so I was thinking about what you said. - Let's move in together. - Really?! - Jamie, what happened? - I'll tell you later, all right? Just find an apartment, and I love you. I... Jamie... Jamie, wait! Did I just hear an alarm start ringing? Did I see sirens go flying past? Though I don't know what tomorrow's bringing I've got a singular impression Things are moving too fast I'm gliding smooth as a figure skater I'm riding hot as a rocket blast I just expected it ten years later I've got a singular impression Things are moving too fast And you say "Oh, no, step on the brakes Do whatever it takes, but stop this train Slow, slow, the light's turning red" But I say "No, no, Whatever I do I barrel on through and I don't complain" No matter what I try I'm flying full speed ahead I'm never worried to walk the wire I won't do anything just half-assed But with the stakes getting somewhat higher I've got a singular impression That things are moving too fast I found a woman I love And I found an agent who loves me He's like a young Jonathan Franzen. Things might get bumpy But some people analyze every detail Some people stall when they can't see the trail Some people freeze out of fear that they'll fail But I keep rolling on Some people can't find success with their art Some people never feel love in their heart Some people can't tell the two things apart But I keep rolling on Oh, oh Maybe I can't follow through But oh, oh What else am I supposed to do? Ooh Hey, Mike, it's Cathy. Yeah, how are you? Um, yeah, no, just two quick things. I'm not going to talk your ear off. I just wanted to know if you got the reviews that I sent you from last summer? Thank you. Yeah, it's really exciting. No, the second thing was just... ...if you have anything you want to send me in on, I'm sort of suddenly... free this summer, I'm, like, available, so... Yes. Yeah, as soon as I'm doing something in the city, I'll let you know. OK. No, no, no, no, I understand. OK, thanks. That wasn't... that wasn't too painful, was it? Right. OK. OK. Bye, Mike. OK, ladies. Uh... Mariah, Taylor, Rachel, Lauren and Sophia. Follow me to the dance audition. And everyone else, thank you very much. I dreamed of writing like the high and mighty Now I'm the subject of a bidding war I met my personal Aphrodite I'm doing things I never dreamed of before We start to take the next step together Found an apartment on 73rd The Atlantic Monthly's printing my first chapter Two thousand bucks without rewriting one word I left Columbia and I don't regret it I wrote a book and Sonny Mehta read it My heart's been stolen My ego's swollen I just keep rolling along Oh Oh, yeah And I think "Well, well, what else is in store?" Got all this and more before 24 It's hard not to be sure I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm feeling panicked and rushed and hurried I'm feeling outmaneuvered and outclassed But I'm so happy I can't get worried About this singular impression I've got a singular impression Things are moving too fast Hi, can I help you? Yes, hi. I'm looking for Alise Michaels. - Mr. Wellerstein. - Yes. Hey, I'm Dade, Alise's assistant. - Let me show you the way. - Oh, great. - Hi. - Hello. Hi. Jamie. - Jamie Wellerstein. - Alise Michaels. It is an absolute pleasure to meet you. - Wow, this is great. - Have a seat. Would you like a glass of water? Yes. Thank you so much for having me. Everyone in the office is absolutely thrilled to meet you. Everybody has been so nice, from just walking in the door. - Everyone's a huge fan of the book. - This is beautiful. - I've never even been this high up. - It's a great office. Yes, thank you. That's great. Thank you. One day we're just like Leave It To Beaver One day it's just a typical life And then he's off on a trip to Jamie-land Staring catatonic out the window Barely even breathing all the while And then he'll smile His eyes light up and deep within the ground Without a sound A moment comes to life And I'm a part of that I'm a part of that Next day it's just like it never happened We're making dinners We're making plans Then he gets on the mule train to Jamie-land Handful after handful of Doritos Circling the apartment, Logging miles And then he smiles His eyes light up And how can I complain? Yes, he's insane But look what he can do And I'm a part of that I'm a part of that And it's true I tend to follow in his stride Instead of side by side I take his cue True But there's no question, there's no doubt I said I'd stick it out And follow through And when I do Then he smiles And where else can I go? I didn't know The rules do not apply And then he smiles And nothing else makes sense While he invents The world that's passing by And I'm a part of that I'm a part of that I'm a part of that Aren't I? I'm a part of that Hey. How are you doing, babe? You did... Not a very good day at the bar? I'm sorry. Did you at least, get some good tips? Get any... - Shit! - Oh. You look really nice. Hey... are you working on anything tonight? - Like what? - You know, your photos? The dress? Like... Don't you have an audition or something later this week that you need to get ready for? - I'm not going. - Why? Because, I'm not going to get it. Oh, come on, did you call your agent or anything? - He's on a retreat. - Retreat? What the hell is an agent retreat? I don't know. They go into the woods and sacrifice actresses to breed more agents. - That's frightening, Cathy. - I don't make them do it. Hey, no, look, I have prepared a little surprise for you in the form of the story. - No, baby, please. - Come on. - No, I've had such a shitty day. - No, listen... I've literally been doing this for hours, so you're going to sit up for, like, five minutes and listen, OK? You know, if I had known there were going to be this many stories, - I wouldn't have ever dated a writer. - Well, too late. You're going to like it. I promise. It's a Christmas story. You like Christmas. I call it the Story of Schmuel, the Tailor of Klimovich. Schmuel would work till half-past ten At his tailor shop in Klimovich Get up at dawn and start again With the hems and pins and twist Are you going to touch my dress right now? Forty-one years had come and gone At his tailor shop in Klimovich Watching the winters soldier on There was one thing Schmuel missed Are you ready for this? "If I only had time" old Schmuel said "I would build the dress that's in my head A dress to fire the mad desire Of girls from here to Minsk But I have no more hours left to sew" Then the clock upon the wall began to glow And the clock said "Na na na na, na na na Oh, Schmuel you'll get to be happy Na na na na, na na na I give you unlimited time" - It's a magical clock. - I've never been more attracted to you. "So Schmuel Go sew and be happy" But Schmuel said "No, no, it's not my lot I've gotta make do with the time I've got Oh, look at the time. It's time to go. Here we go. Why do all my things have to come into this? Schmuel was done at half-past ten And he said "Good night, old Klimovich" Put on his coat to go But then The clock cried "Wait! Not yet" Pretty good, right? "Even though you're not wise or rich You're the finest man in Klimovich Listen up, Schmuel Make one stitch And you'll see what you get" But Schmuel said "Clock, it's much too late I'm at peace with life I accept my fate" But the clock said "Schmuel! One stitch and you will Unlock the dreams you've lost" So Schmuel, with reluctance, took his thread He pulled a bolt of velvet and he said "I should take out my teeth and go to bed I'm sitting here with talking clocks Instead" And the clock said "Na na na na, na na na Oh, Schmuel you'll get to be happy" And then they dance. Na na na na, na na na No. No, thank you. Come on! Na na na na, na na na "Just do it and you can be happy" So Schmuel put the thread through the needle's eye And the moon stared down from a starless sky And he pushed the thread through the velvet black And he looked, and the clock was turning back So he grabbed his shears and he cut some lace As the hands reversed on the old clock's face And his fingers flew and the fabric swirled It was 9:15 all around the world Every cut and stitch was a perfect fit As if God Himself were controlling it And Schmuel cried through a rush of tears "Take me back Take me back all 41 years" And on it went Down that silent street Till Schmuel's dress Was at last complete And he stretched his arms And he closed his eyes And the morning sun Finally started To rise And the dress he made on that endless night Was a dress that would make any soul take flight Not a swatch, not a skein had gone to waste Every ribbon and button ideally placed And sewn into the seams Were 41 seasons of dreams Dreams that you could feel Coming real Come on. And that very dress so the papers swore Was the dress a girl in Odessa wore On the day she promised forevermore To love a young man named Schmuel Who only one day before Had knocked at her kitchen door Thank you. That was pretty long, but it was fun. Oh, it's not over yet. Plenty have hoped and dreamed and prayed But they can't get out of Klimovich If Schmuel had been a cute goyishe maid He'd have looked a lot like you - Sorry, I'm Schmuel in this story!? - Oh, yeah. I'm not the girl from Odessa? Maybe it's just that you're afraid to go out On to a limb... ovich Maybe your heart's completely swayed But your head can't follow through But shouldn't I want the world to see The brilliant girl who inspires me? Don't you think that now's a good time to be The ambitious freak you are? Say goodbye to wiping ashtrays at the bar Come on. Say hello to Cathy Hiatt A big-time star 'Cause I say "Na na na na, na na na na Cathy, you get to be happy Na na na na, na na na I give you unlimited time Na na na na na na na Stop temping and go, go be happy" Here's a headshot guy and a new Backstage Where you're right for something on every page Take a breath Take a step Take a chance Take your time Have I mentioned today How lucky I am To be in love With you Hi. I could have a mansion on a hill I could lease a villa in Seville But it wouldn't be as nice as a summer in Ohio With a gay midget named Karl Playing Tevye and Porgy God... Wow. I could wander Paris after dark Take a carriage ride through Central Park But it wouldn't be as nice as a summer in Ohio Where I'm sharing a room with a former stripper and her snake - I love you. - Wayne. Oh, my God! I could have a satchel Full of dollar bills Cures for all the nation's ills Oh! Pills to make a lion purr I could be in line to be the British queen Look like I was 17 Wow. Still I'm certain I'd prefer To be going slowly batty Forty miles east of Cincinnati I could shove an ice pick in my eye I could eat some fish from last July But it wouldn't be as awful as a summer in Ohio Without cable, hot water Vietnamese food or you Oh, baby, I love you. I saw your book at a Target In Kentucky under a sign that said "new and recommended" I stole a look at your picture on the inside sleeve And then I couldn't leave Richard, who was with me got uncharacteristically quiet And he said, "All things considered, I guess you don't have to buy it" So I smile like Mona Lisa and I lay my Visa down He wants me He wants me But he ain't gonna get me Damn right! I've found my guiding light I tell the stars each night Look at me Look at him Son of a bitch, I guess I'm doing something right I finally got something right No, it's not Nirvana but it's on the way I play Anita at the matinee Then I'll get on my knees and pray I can state in my next bio I'm never gonna go back to Ohio I could chew on tin foil for a spell I could get a root canal in hell But it wouldn't be as swell As this summer is gonna be 'Cause the torture is just exquisite While I'm waiting for you to visit So hurry up, schmuck Get unstuck and get on the scene Love the midget, the stripper, Wayne the snake and Mrs. Jamie Wellerstein That's me No, that one's Jerry Seinfeld That one's John Lennon there No, the Dakota The San Remo is up a few blocks Have you been inside the museum? We should go Meet the dinosaurs Cathy Will you share your life with me For the next ten minutes? For the next ten minutes We can handle that We could watch the waves We could watch the sky Or just sit and wait As the time ticks by And if we make it till then Could I ask you again For another ten? And if you in turn agree To the next ten minutes And the next ten minutes Till the morning comes Then just holding you Might compel me to Ask you for more There are so many lives I want to share with you I will never be complete Until I do I am not always on time Please don't expect that from me I will be late But if you can just wait I will make it eventually Not like it's in my control Not like I'm proud of the fact But anything other than being exactly on time I can do I don't know why people run I don't know why things fall through I don't know how anybody survives in this life Without someone like you I could protect and preserve I could say no and goodbye But why, Jamie? Why? I want to be your wife I want to bear your child I want to die, knowing I Had a long, full life In your arms That I can do - Forever, with you - Will you share your life with me? - Forever - For the next ten lifetimes? - Forever, Jamie - For a million summers? Till the world explodes Till there's no one left Who has ever known us apart There are so many dreams I need to see with you There are so many years I need to be with you I will never be complete I will never be alive I will never change the world Until I do I do I Do Is that one John Lennon? That's the San Remo? Isn't that the museum? Can we go see the dinosaurs? Thank you. Are you kidding me? Everyone tells you that the minute you get married Every other woman in the world suddenly finds you attractive Well, that's not true It only affects the kind of women you always wanted to sleep with But they wouldn't give you the time of day before And now they're banging down your door, and falling to their knees At least that's what it feels like because you can not touch them! In fact, you can't even look at them Close your eyes Close your eyes Close your eyes Except you're sitting there eating your corned beef sandwich And all of a sudden, this pair of breasts walks by And smiles at you and you're like, "That's not fair" And in a perfect world A miracle would happen And every other girl would fly away And it'd be me and Cathy and nothing else would matter But it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, I mean, I'm happy And I'm fine, I'm fine I'm fine, it's not a problem It's just a challenge it's a challenge to resist Temptation And I have to say that what exacerbates the problem Is I'm at these parties I'm the center of attention I'm the grand fromage And here she comes "Let's get a cup of coffee Will you look at my manuscript?" And I'm showing her my left hand, I'm gesticulating with my left hand And then, whoa! There's Cathy! Because she knows, they always know And there's that really awkward moment Where I try to show I wasn't encouraging this Which of course I was And I don't want to look whipped in front of this woman Which is dumb, I shouldn't care what she thinks since I can't touch her anyway! And in a perfect world, a miracle would happen And every girl would look like Mister Ed And it'd be me and Cathy and nothing else would matter But it's fine, it's fine, it's fine You know I love her And it's fine, it's fine, it's fine it's what I wanted And I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine it's not a problem It's just a challenge It's a challenge to resist Temptation Hi, Mr. Wellerstein. I'll let Alise know you're here. When you come home to me I'll wear a sweeter smile And hope that, for a while, you'll stay When you come home to me Your hand will touch my face And banish any trace of gray Soon, a love will rise anew Even greater than the joy I felt Just missing you And once again, I'll be So proud to call you mine When finally you come home To me - That was lovely. - Really great. - Thank you. - Thank you. OK. No, it went really, really well. Yeah. No, I think I got it. I mean, I hope. Yeah. It's off Broadway, so... Please, God, no more Ohio. Um, I don't where I'm walking, actually. You have to come find me. I'll be there soon, Cathy I'll finish up this chapter and be out the door I swear I'll be there soon, Cathy Don't give up on me yet I am so proud of you, baby You're doing what you never got to do before And I will be there ripe and crawling If frigging Random House stops calling Don't lose faith Don't get down Don't despair I'll be there And in a perfect world A miracle would happen And that day would finally be here And it'd be me and you Riding it together And the things we do going like we planned We're gonna make it through And nothing else will matter We'll be fine We're fine We're fine We're fine We're fine We're fine, we're fine I'll be there soon, Cathy I swear I will When you come home to me I'll wear a sweeter smile And hope that for a while you'll... OK. Thank you. I'm climbing uphill, Jamie Climbing uphill I'm up every morning at six And standing in line with 200 girls Who are younger and thinner than me Who have already been to the gym I'm waiting five hours in line And watching the girls just coming and going In dresses that look just like this Cathy Hiatt. Until my number is finally called When I walk in the room, there's a table of men Always men, usually gay Who've been sitting like I have and listening all day To 200 girls belting as high as they can I am a good person I'm an attractive person I am a talented person Grant me grace When you come home I should have told them I was sick last week They're gonna think this is the way I sing Why is the pianist playing so loud? Should I sing louder? I'll sing louder Maybe I should stop and start over I'm gonna stop and start over Why is the director staring at his crotch? Why is that man staring at my resume? Don't stare at my resume I made up half of my resume Look at me Stop looking at that Look at me No, not at my shoes Don't look at my shoes I hate these stupid shoes Why did I pick these shoes Why did I pick this song? Why did I pick this career? Why? Does this pianist hate me? If I don't get a callback I can go to Crate and Barrel with mom and buy a couch Not that I want to spend a day with mom But Jamie needs space to write Since I'm obviously such a horrible Annoying distraction to him What's he gonna be like when we have kids? And once again Why am I working so hard? These are the people who cast Russell Crowe in a musical Jesus Christ, I suck I suck, I suck When finally you come home... Thanks. That's great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. "He touched the wall and decided he had had enough. He was exhausted, first of all, and he could feel it: his lungs were throbbing and heavy, and his left arm was stinging from the shoulder right down to his wrist. Besides that, seven laps in and the water was still freezing cold, and if he wanted to be honest about it, he felt foolish. A ghost-pale graceless thing flapping about frantically, desperately trying to keep pace with the mermaid in the next lane. He watched her. He watched her back stretching, watched how she seemed to ride the water. He didn't recognize the fierceness in her brow... " I will not be the girl stuck at home in the 'burbs With the baby, the dog and a garden of herbs I will not be the girl in the sensible shoes Pushing burgers and beer nuts and missing the clues I will not be the girl who gets asked how it feels To be trotting along at the genius's heels I will not be the girl who requires a man to get by And I "He recognized her... 'I see you. ' Her clenched jaw, her sharp turns away from him. 'You don't have to let me win,' she had been screaming, but he couldn't hear it at all. " - Ouch. - I'm so proud of you! Beautiful. From Random House, David. - Oh, David. - And Kathryn Marrow. And this is his agent, Mrs. Whitfield. Hello. A pleasure to meet you. Hello, hello. A pleasure to meet you. Wasn't he wonderful? And I've been to every one of them. I've been to so many. And the same thing happens, I'm basically your waitress for the evening, I'm bringing you drinks. I get asked if I'm your publicist, because everybody asks me to take pictures of you on their phone, and these people, they ask me the same things every time. "How did you and Jamie meet? What's Jamie like?" Baby, I'm so sorry they ask you the same questions. No one would notice if I didn't go. You beg me to go and you abandon me and I stand by the bar all night and I'm drinking! I'm holding my purse and I'm waiting for somebody to come talk to me. - You certainly don't talk to me! - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! God, just stop and listen to me! Can we just, for, like, two minutes, have a conversation without you contradicting everything I say? Two minutes! And then fine, you can say whatever you want. OK, look, there are people... And they are publishing my book. And there's a party that they are throwing. And while you've made it very clear that you're not going, I will be going. And that's done. But what's it really about? Is it really about a party, Cathy? Can we please, for a minute, stop blaming And say what you feel? Is it just that you're disappointed To be going again to Ohio? Did you think this would all be much easier Than it's turned out to be? Well, then talk to me, Cathy Talk to me If I didn't believe in you We'd never have gotten this far If I didn't believe in you And all of the 10, 000 women you are If I didn't think you could do Anything you ever wanted to If I wasn't certain that you'd come through somehow The fact of the matter is, Cathy I wouldn't be standing here now If I didn't believe in you We wouldn't be having this fight If I didn't believe in you I'd walk out the door and say, "Cathy, you're right" But I never could let that go Knowing the things about you I know Things, when I met you four years ago I knew It never took much convincing To make me believe in you Don't we get to be happy, Cathy? At some point down the line Don't we get to relax Without some new tsuris To push me yet further from you? And if I'm cheering on your side, Cathy Why can't you support mine? Why do I have to feel I've committed some felony Doing what I always swore I would do? I don't want you to hurt Hey, hey. I don't want you to sink But you know what I think? I think you'll be fine Just hang on and you'll see But don't make me wait till you do to be happy with you Will you listen to me? No one can give you courage No one can thicken your skin I will not fail so you can be comfortable, Cathy I will not lose because you can't win If I didn't believe in you And, and here's where the travelogue ends If I didn't believe in you I couldn't have stood before all of our friends And said "This is the life I choose This is the thing I can't bear to lose Trip us or trap us but we refuse to fall" That's what I thought we agreed on Cathy If I hadn't believed in you I wouldn't have loved you at all Baby... Baby, just... just please, put on your dress, and we'll go to this stupid party. And we... Can you just do that for me, Cathy, please? Cathy? Where are you going? Cathy? Cathy?! Cathy! Stop! Uh, you know they're gonna love me. I'm sure they will. Come on. Hello, Mr. Hiatt. Uh, may I please have pre-marital sex with your daughter? Thank you. Oh, my God! My best friend had a little situation At the end of our senior year And like a shot she and Mitchell got married that summer Carol Ann getting bigger every minute Thinking "What am I doing here?" While Mitchell's out every night being a heavy-metal drummer They got a little cute house on a little cute street With a crucifix on the door Mitchell got a job at a record store in the mall Just the typical facts of a typical life In a town on the Eastern Shore I thought about what I wanted It wasn't like that at all Made Carol Ann a cute baby sweater Thinking I can do better than that - Ow! - Please just drive. Please just drive! In a year or so I moved to the city Thinking "What have I got to lose?" Got a room, got a cat and got 20 pounds thinner Met a guy in a class I was taking with some very well placed tattoos He wouldn't leave me alone 'less I went with him to dinner And I guess he was cute and I guess he was sweet And I guess he was good in bed I gave up my life for a better part of a year So I'm starting to think that this maybe might work And the second it entered my head He needed to take some time off Focus on his career He blew me off with a heartfelt letter I thought, "I can do better than that" You don't have to get a haircut You don't have to change your shoes You don't have to like Duran Duran Just one song! Just love me You don't have to put the seat down You don't have to watch the news You don't have to learn to tango You don't have to eat prosciutto You don't have to change a thing Just stay with me I want you and you and nothing but you Miles and piles of you Finally, I'll have something worthwhile To think of each morning You and you and nothing but you No substitution will do Nothing but fresh undiluted and pure Top of the line And totally mine I don't need any lifetime commitments I don't need to get hitched tonight I don't want you to throw up all your walls and defenses I don't mean to put on any pressure But I know when a thing is right And I spend every day reconfiguring my senses When we get to my house take a look at that town Take a look at how far I've gone I will never go back Never look back anymore And it feels like my life led right to your side And will keep me there from now on Think about what you wanted Think about what could be Think about how I love you And say you'll move in with me Think of what's great about me and you Think of the bullshit we've both been through Think of what's past because we can do better We can do better We can do better than that We can do better than that Hey, kid Good morning You look like an angel I don't remember When we fell asleep We should get up, kid Cathy is waiting Look at us, lying here Dreaming, pretending I made a promise And I took a vow I wrote a story And we changed the ending Cathy, just look at me now Hold on Facts are facts Just relax Lay low All right The panic recedes Nobody needs To know Put on my armor I'm off to Ohio Back into battle Till I don't know when Swearing to her that I Never was with you And praying I'll hold you again Hold on Clip these wings Things get out of hand All right It's over It's done No one will understand No one will understand We build a tree house I keep it from shaking Little more glue every time that it breaks Perfectly balanced And then I start making The conscious Deliberate mistakes All that I ask for Is one little corner One private room At the back of my heart Tell her I found one She sends out battalions To claim it And blow it apart I grip and she grips And faster we're sliding Sliding and spilling And what can I do? Come back to bed, kid Take me inside you I promise I won't lie to you Hold on Don't cry yet I won't let you go All right The panic recedes All right Everyone bleeds All right I get what I need And nobody needs To know Nobody needs To know And since I have to be in love with someone Since I need to be in love with someone Maybe I could be in love with someone Like you Don't kiss me goodbye again Leave this night clean and quiet You want the last word You want me to laugh But leave it for now All you can say All you can feel Was wrapped up inside that one perfect kiss Leave it at that I'll watch you turn the corner and go And goodbye until tomorrow Goodbye until the next time you call And I will be waiting I will be waiting Goodbye until tomorrow Goodbye till I recall how to breathe And I have been waiting I have been waiting for you I stand on a precipice I struggle to keep my balance I open myself I open myself one stitch at a time Finally yes Finally now Finally something takes me away Finally free Finally he can cut through these strings And open my wings So goodbye until tomorrow Goodbye until my feet touch the floor And I will be waiting I will be waiting Goodbye until tomorrow Goodbye until the rest of my life And I have been waiting I have been waiting for you Waiting for you I called Alise to help me pack my bags I went downtown and closed the bank account It's not about another shrink It's not about another compromise I'm not the only one who's hurting here I don't know what the hell is left to do You never saw how far the crack had opened You never knew I had run out of rope And I could never rescue you All you ever wanted But I could never rescue you No matter how I tried All I could do Was love you hard And let you go No matter how I tried All I could do Was love you God, I loved you so So we could fight Or we could wait - Or I could go - Goodbye until tomorrow Goodbye until I crawl to your door And I will be waiting I will be waiting You never noticed how the wind had changed Goodbye until tomorrow I didn't see a way we both could win Goodbye until I'm done thanking God And I have been waiting I have been waiting for you Goodbye, Cathy I have been waiting I have been waiting for you Goodbye I will keep waiting I will keep waiting for you Just close the gate I'll stand and wait Jamie - Goodbye - Goodbye
