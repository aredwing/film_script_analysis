It's justwhat people wear here, that's all. I think that's probably why your government gave youthis suit. It's just a trifle out of date, that's all. I must give suit back. Well, you can give these back when you go home. These can be yours to have while you're here at summer school and... Why bird on? "Don't let the turkeys get you down. " It's not a captalist thing, Li, it's just... Honesty, it's just a bit of nonsense, like a lot of things in America. What it mean?

We've run the summer program for several years now and we've been very successful. Yeah, I see. It's a tremendous success. I think they're talking about us. Probably. Because it would be wonderful for the Houston Ballet. The decision would have to be made by the party, Mr Stevenson. Oh, of course, I understand. Yes. Alright. How'd it go? Well, they're going to consider it. I expect they take it to the highest level. Well, how long will that take? It's not up to me. It's up to the Chinese Government. We're ready for photograph, Mr Stevenson. Alright. Hi. Um... I can go if you want to use the studio. No, um, stay. Watch. Arabesque Um... foot... stretch Oh, I can't. Um, my ankle, I broke it. Right here. They put a rod in it. When they took the cast off my calf had shrunk two inches. It's fine now, I think. It's just my confidence. I'm sorry, you don't understand. Um, I-I understand. - You do? - Uh... No. - En pointe. En pointe. - OK. This, turn out. Yeah. Better. I'm Elizabeth, by the way. Everyone calls me Liz. - Liz? - Yeah. Like Li. Everyone call me Li. Yeah, I know who you are. Li Cunxin. - 'Schwinsin'? - Mm. That's really beautiful. What does it mean? Um, it mean... ...'keep my innocent heart'. Um... you dance with company? Oh, no. No. I was in the corps of... 'Nutcracker' once, butthats as close as I've come to getting a contract. This is my second time in the full-time program trying to get Ben to notice me. Ben? Yeah? Today, in street, someone speak me word I not understand. Um, not find in here. What was it? Um... 'chink'. What it mean? Um, let's see. Do you know when youre in the theatre, and everyone is getting seated andthe curtain is closed, if the stage light is on, and the curtain parts just a tiny little bit then the light from the stage shines through what we call a chink in thecurtain. So if someone calls you a 'chink', Li, what it means is that... ...they see the light that's there inside of you. Oh! Oh... fantastic. And trace the leg, follow the line. Nice, Lori. Pull back. Just feed her out. And extend the leg. Lovely. Good, good. Yeah, yeah. Very good. Very good. Alright? In Chnese, we say 'will go', 'go today', 'go tomorrow', 'go yesterday, 'you go', 'I go', 'she go', 'we all go'. - Right. - Much, much easier. English changes all time. Youre doing very well. Thank you. Chnese official not come here. What do you mean? - She lau ban - Lau ban? Um... boss person. In China, class enemy. She looks like an opera diva. What? What is it? I am with you, American girl. Mm-hm. Make trouble for Ben. No. It's OK. No one has to know. Um... here. Try this. What is it? It's, um, vegetable from sea. Good? - God, it's so hard to chew - Hard to chew. Yeah, like English! Um... Thank you very much, Elizabeth... um, Liz. Thank you, Li. I had a nice night. Nice night? Hello! Hi. Where have you been? Uh... I go Chinatown. Um... movie - watch movie. - A kung-fu movie? - Yes, Ben. I go bed now. Nice night. Goodnight. Huh? GOOD... night. Oh, yes Uh... good... night. Very good. Fantastic. Alright, yeah, just a litte more over the shoulder next time. I want to take it from the lift. - Just a ttle more sustained. - Sure. OK? Because I thlnk you have time musically. - Oh, yeah. - Alright. So, seven, two, three, eight, two, three... And up with the accent, and hold a little longer. - Argh! - Bobby! What have you done? What's happened? Oh, God. Argh, sorry. - Oh, Christ. They'll bring you some ice. What about one of the principals or soloists? Well, they're all away on vacation. David Trembath's at Galveston. Wel he can make it here in time, surely. - Li's better than he is. - It's tonight, Ben. And Li's just a student here. The union wont allow it. Ben, this is the biggest night on the arts calendar. How's he supposed to learn 'Don Quixote' in three hours? He already knows the solo. All he has to learn is the pas de deux. Everybody who is anyone is gonna be here tonight, including the Vice President. Yes I know, but Li told me he once danced forthe great Madame Mao - we're alright. But he's Chinese. What I mean is... I mean, he can't play a Spaniard, can he? Well, unless I'm mistaken, Betty Lou, I distinctly remember Marlon Brando playing a Japanese villager. Oh, I loved that movie! Ben, what if he's not up to it? He's up to it, Cynthia. And keep the Spanish feel, keep that attitude. When you come out of the la seconde, just do it with as many pirouettes as you can. And be sure to finish on the music. That's... It's not too late, Li. I mean, we can cancel. Um, no. - Um, I can do this, Ben. - No, you can do it. I know you can do it. Go from the top of the pas de deux? - The beginning? - Yes. From the beginning. OK. And... tomb, pas de bourre, glissade, lift, pirouette. Tomb, arabesque, soutenu, get close to her, ready for the one-arm lift. OK. OK. When the show starts, if you can't see there, you can... Oh, thanks. I hate the opera. But they have the ballet too. I just hope it all works out. Ladies and gentlemen, take your seats. Tonight's performance of 'Die Fledermaus' will commence in two minutes. Vice President Bush and his wife, Barbara, are attending the opening of Houston Opera's summer season 'Die Fledermaus', by Johann Strauss. Stars of the Houston Ballet are also... Oh, hi. Hello. You better be right, Ben Stevenson. Consul Zhang, so glad you could make it. Lori, um... woman dancer called, um... 'ballerina'. What you call man? 'Danseur noble'. Not nice, not like 'ballerina'. OK well how about Big Ballerino? Ballerino. I like. All set, Big Ballerino? All set, Big Ballerina. Ladies und gentlemen, I would like to present to you all two very special guests from sunny Spain. Oh, come on. Not bad. (ORCHESTRA PLAYS ROUSING MUSIC FROM 'DON QUIXOTE' BY L. MINKUS) Oh, boy. Fantastic! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! How 'bout that, huh? Bravo! OK. Oh, wait, wait, wait. There's a card. OK "The lucky carp wind chime. "Legend has itthat as the carp swims upstream, "it has to leap... " "... over many obstacles, "and with the final leap "it turns into the celestial dragon. " Li, wait. Slow down one second. Um... I'm a virgin. Um... a virgin? It means I've never done it before. Done what? I've never had sex before. You know what sex is? Yeah. One, two, three, four, five, sex! No. No. - No? - No, no. It's how a man and a woman make a baby together. You want to make a baby? No! No. No, no, no, no. No! That's not what I'm tryng to say. No. What I'm... what I'm... Never mind. So the roster for the opening week of 'Swan Lake' will be posted today, but Li wil be guesting Bobby's role. You've got to be kidding, right? No offence, Li, but I'm Bobbys understudy. Of course you are, David. It's just an opportunity for Houstonians to see Li dance before he goes back, that's all. Alright? In fact, I have applied to the Chinese Government for permission for us all to tour China next year. Thats right. I'll be in that. Oh, yeah, me too. - Hey, you just stay injured. It'd be a first for an American company. More kung-fu? Yes More kung-fu. Fantastic. Goodnight. Goodnight! Thank you for com ng, Mr Stevenson. No, not at all. I received a telex from Beijing last night. I'm sorry, but the request for Cunxin to have his stay extended has been refused. But I thought... Is there anything we can do? No, Mr Stevenson, there isn't. Li, don't worry. I'll... You'll be able to come back. I'll make sure of it. I'll do everything I can. I promise. Ben not understand. He's too much in love with China. In China, not so easy. Tell you what to do, where to go, what can say. Maybe I can't come back. You know, I must dance political ballet in China, but I dance better here. Because feel more... free. Well, there are several optons available for you to stay in the United States, if that's your wish. Seeking political asylum is one, but that's the last option I'd recommend because it means youd have to defect. No, no defect. Li's worried abouthis family. He doesn't want to make things difficut for them. He also wants to be able to go back and see them. OK, well, from what I've read and heard about you, I'm certain we'd be able to qualify you, based on your extraordinary skills as a performing artist. What would be involved, Charles? Well, we'd have to get supporting statements and a petition signed by an employer, the Houston Ballet Company, no doubt. Alternatively, if you were in a relationship or planning to get married soon and your spouse was a US citizen, well, there would be no issue whatsoever because the Chinese Government recognises international marriage laws. Are you in a relationship, Li? Uh, do you have a girlfriend? No, he doesn't. Uh yes, I have, um, American girlfriend. - You what? - How about that! Who is she? Really? Well, first of all I would strongly advise against a marriage of convenence, unless of course it was a serious relationshp you're in. If there's one thing worse than an immgration problem, it's a marriage problem. Is it a serious relationship, Li? Is it serious, Li? On behalf of the Houston Ballet Company and all of us who've had the privilege of seeing you dance, Li, I'd like to say how exciting it's been having you here. You came as a student and leave here as a star. Um... just... Thank you, Ben. And... ...thank the audience. Thank you, America. Mr Stevenson, were ready for the photograph with Consul Zhang. Excuse me. Of course. I don't know. Has anyone seen him? I'll just ask you to step in together. Great. Thank you. Consul, Anita Jones. Anita's the arts editor for the 'Houston Chronicle'. - I'm pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you too, sir. Mind if I get a few words from you about Li and what it means to China to have had him here? Of course. - Excuse me. - Sure. I see it as another postive step in... He's not at the theatre. - Did you try my place? - Sure. No answer. Sir, we're ready to serve. Do you mind if we just wait... just a little longer? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Thank you. - They're starting to wonder. - Well, I know. Maybe you should say something. I don't know what I'm going to say. Mr Stevenson, it's for you. What the hell is going on, Dilworth? Where's Li? Li, you can't stay here. It's out of the question. Ben, um... I'm married. - You're what? - I'm married. I not go back to China. No, you can't be married. Don't be ridlculous. I mean, who did you marry? Elizabeth. Elizabeth? Elizabeth who? - Oh, you connving little bitch. - Stop! Ben, I love her. You are going back, Li. If you love China, you go back. I... I stay. You are not married! He's not married! For God's sake, Ben, calm down! Li... Li, Consul Zhang will think it's all my doing, just to keep you here. Please, don't do this to me. I- I not go back. You have to. You have to. Dont you understand, it's gonna ruin everythng - everything I've worked for. I can't believe you'd be so selfish. Li, no-one is making you do this. Mr Foster, I want no trouble for Ben. I must tell Consul Zhang I make decision, not Ben. That's all very well but the consulate is Chinese territory for all intents and purposes. I explained that to him already, Charles. Please have a seat. - Well, well. - Mmm! Right. I don't know how you coud be so foolish! - Hi there, I'm Li's attorney. - A lawyer? And you should know better! I had no idea Li was gonna bring a lawyer. Lets try to keep things positive, shall we? I couldn't agree more. Thank you for coming. So many of you. Consul, how are you? I'm... I know who you are, Mr Foster. Pleased to meet you. My staff tell me you are a member of the US China Friendship Association. Yes, I am. I was in China 18 months ago, as a matter of fact. Vice Consul Lan is happy to discuss legal matters if you would be so kind as to go with him. Mr Stevenson, perhaps you could accompany them. - Yes, Id be happy to. - I'll be right back, Li. Now, if you'd please allow me to speak wth Cunxin alone. No, I'm gonna stay with Li. Well, don't you have balls! Well, it seems like I need them. I'm staying too. We have been asked to leave. Dilworth, speak to Consul Zhang. It's OK. What did he say? It's OK. We'll wait. OK. I'm interested to know how and when, exactly, was it that Li Cunxin arrived at this decision? With all due respect, sir, that is not what we're here to discuss. I'm only too happy to discuss it. I think we should. Woud you care for some refreshments? No, thanks. If you'll excuse me, I'll get back to my client. Please sit down, Mr Foster! Uh... No! What's going on? - Help! Someone help! What's going on? Now, I'm not gonna put up with... Goddamn! Li! Li! Help! Li! Li! Li! Li! Open this door, goddamn it! - Come back here! LI! Li! No! Help! Li! Li! - What do we do? - For God's sake! What's happened? Where's Li? - ELZABETH They took him! Upstairs! There was at least five of them. What have you done with Li? Please, I must ask all of you to leave now. Excuse me, Consul, but I believe someone just dragged my client out of here. Mr Foster, you told us you're a supporterof US-Slno reations, and what is best for US-Sino relations is for Li Cunxin to return to China. Please let me try and convince him. Well, that's all very well but for one thing, sir. We may be on the territory of the People's Republic of China, sir, but in this country, what you're doing - wherever you're doing it - is called kidnapping, and it's against the law. Well, he's just walking... You just drove him away. - I think we shoud just leave. - No! How can you even say that after what we just saw? Li's a Chinese national. I thnk we should just go and let the Chinese deal with it. Weren't you even listening? The course of Li's return to China has most likely already been mapped out. A they need is for us to leave so they can go through with it. Go through with what, how? What are you talking about? Remove Li in the early hours, heavily sedated I suspect, and putting him on the first plane back to China. Who the hell is calling me at this hour? Uh-huh. It's Charles Foster, Judge. Sorry to wake you. Ths better be good, Charles. Yes, well, the Consul General of China is holding a ballet dancer against his will. I need to get a restraining order. Do I have the right to restrain the Consul General of China? Sir, I sincerely hope so. There are members of the press outside. - Mm-hm. - You're a lawyer. Will you make them go away, please? Consul, not even the President of the United States can make the press go away. Did you call them, Mr Foster? No. I suspect they want to know what's happened to Li. My advice to you is, they don't have to know. What's happened can be our secret. But if you contnue to hold Li here you're gonna put our secret on the front page of every newspaper in the world I'd like to use your phone again, please. Phone? MAN Mark Gibson, China desk officer. Yes, this is Charles Foster. There's been an incident at the Chinese consulate in Houston. Please alert the ambassador in Pekng immediately. Mr Foster, there's no need to make any more calls. - Please hang up the phone. - Wheres Li? I want to see him. May I have your attention please? I'm pleased to inform you that Li Cunxin has decided to return home to China. You may all leave now. If you don't mind, I'd ke to hear that from Li. Yeah, he's just saying that. If you do not leave voluntarily you will all be removed. Oh, yeah? Just try. We are not leaving until we see Li. Mr Stevenson, but you assured me you are not at fault. I'm not. And I'm not saying I don't want Li to go back. I'm just saying... well, let me see him. Just gonna have to wait. Oh! 'Houston Chronicle', Mr Foster. Is Li Cunxin being held inside the consuate? I'm not making any statements at this time. - Are you his attorney? - Thank you. You know, when I was little, my aunt had a cat named Chairman Miaow. I could never figure out why. Miaow. - Chairman Miaow. - Oh, for God's sake, Dilworth! Here, kitty-kitty! A Chinese puzzle is taking place in Houston, involving an exchange student from Peking, an American girl, the government of the People's Republic of China and the Department of State. His attorney is believed to have contacted the Vice President to put pressure on the Chinese Government in Peking in order to effect his release. I hope you don't get me into trouble, Charles, or you're gonna be sorry now. I hope so too, Judge. I just need you to sign this restraining order. Lets say we worry about that later, hmm? You better take a look at this. Excuse me, please. Thank you. Yes? I have an order I'm serving under authority of the US Marshal. We open at nine o'clock. Would you please tell Consul Zhang that Charles Foster is here? Wait. - Mr Foster? - Not now! Sir, you should know the Vice Presdent has had discussions with Premier Deng Xiaoping. We expect instructions will soon be issued from Peking, via the Chinese Embassy in Washington. Li? Come to bed, please. You can't keep doing this night after night. They're watching. Theres no-one, Li. No-one's watching. Come on, come back to bed. Hello, Li. Hello, Ben. Um, we go to Florida. Liz's mother she live there, in West Palm Beach. Hmm. What are you going to do when you get there? Get job. What, in a supermarket? No, I go for audition. Liz too. Oh, no Li. It... Oh! It's not that easy, you know. I mean, it takes time to get established. And I know this isn't your home, but right now, it's the next best thing. You don't know a soul in America outside of Houston. Of course, youre a brilliant dancer and you're very popular here, so I'd be lying if I said I was doing it entrely for you. Elizabeth? She's just... Shes not good enough to dance with the company, Li. But you know, the company is having open audtions. We're required to do that once a year. They're coming up. - Alright? - Alright, I'll think about it. Alright. What did he want? He, um, offer me a contract, as soloist. - Soloist? - Yeah. Wow! Did he say anything about me? Yes. He said you can go for audition. - Audition? - Yes. Liz, you very good dancer. The open auditions. Yes. Maybe we dance in the company together. Be good, no? Mm hm. Yeah. - If you still want go to Florida... - No. No, this is a great opportunity for you. Are you sure, Liz? Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah. Congratulations. Keep it crisp. Lori, try not to pull focus. You're a unit. Alright, Lori? Lori, you're standing out. Back to the top. Come on, once again. Lori? He just put me back in the corps. What for? Why? I thnk he's trying to get me to walk away from my contract. No! You prima ballerina. Not anymore. Mary McKendry, Ben's favourite. He got her back from the Australian Ballet. You must have met her in China. She's gonna be doing Swan Lake with you. Lori, Ben do this to you because you help me. No. Li, that's not true. Yes, it is. I cause many problems. For you, for Ben, for Liz. For my family. Have you tried contacting them? I write letter. Nothing What about calling? No. Making too much trouble, maybe danger for my family. Better not. Better they forget their sixth son. You're OK. You're OK. Shh, shh, shh. It was just a dream. Just a dream. Shh. Hi. I come home, right? Big mess. What's... Rice in sink. That's no good. So that's why you're angry. Want me to cook and clean for you? I'm not your mother. Here, got you some noodles. No, you not my mother. My mother, she work very hard, all day, all her life. What you do? What do you think I do? Everything is fine for you. You have your career. It's not fine, Liz. You not understand! No, you don't understand! I want to dance, Li. I have my dreams, too. At least you can go to sleep at night thinking about yours. In night, I think of my family in China. I worry, Liz. There's no sleep. Just nightmares and terrible feeling all the time. Well, what about my feelings, huh? What about me? You don't understand. No, stop telling me I don't understand. I want to dance, Li. I've tried to be what you want me to be, and I can't do it. I can't do this anymore. I'm going to San Francisco to audition. I need to get into a company. You understand, don't you, Li? Yes, I understand. When we got married, was it because you loved me or was it because you wanted to stay? Bec... because... because I love you. I love you too. It's been five long years since Li Cunxin made his dramatic leap to freedom in Houston, Texas from communist China. He's here in Washington and he'll be dancing at the Kennedy Center tonight and we're thrilled to have him with us on the show today. Wecome to Washington, Li. Thank you. It's great to be here. Li, you've toured wth the Houston Ballet Company and danced all over the world, but your freedom came at a price. Yes, it did. I haven't been allowed to go back to China since. But your entire family is there. Yes. Have you heard from them? Do you even know how they are? No, I haven't heard from them. How do you survive, not knowing? I carry a picture of them wherever I go. And when I dance, I dance for them. I saw you dance together in New York. I've never seen such exquisite partnering. Thank you very much. You made it look so natural. That's because he is. Well, it does help to have the right partner. Li, there's someone here who wants to see you. Hello, Cunxin. I'm working at the embassy in Washington now. You have made us very proud tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me. Your mother and father are well. I took the liberty of checking. You don't know how much that means to me. If I have a dream, it's to be able to go back one day. I know. Is there any chance? I'm afraid not enough time has passed, Cunxin. But I will see what I can do. Thank you. I really appreciate that. Thank you. Lades and gentlemen, I'm sorry, there's going to be a slight delay. We have some VIPs coming in from out of town, and when they arrive, which won't be long now, I'm sure they'll be forgiven. So thank you very much for your patience and understanding. Uh, Li, we're just holding the curtain for 15 minutes. Why? There's some VIPs arriving. OK. Thanks. Hey. - Good luck. - Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, five minute call. Just along here, if you'll follow me. I think that's his family. Oh, isn't that wonderful? Ni hao. I'm Ben Stevenson. I'm so glad you're here. Ni hao. Please, come to your seats. What's that for? Don't know. Here you are. Oh, xie xie! (ORCHESTRA PLAYS 'THE RITE OF SPRING' BY IGOR STRAVINSKY) Bravo! Bravo! - Fantastic! - He was superb. You've met my parents. This is my oldest brother. This is my fifth brother. Cunxin! Ni hao.
