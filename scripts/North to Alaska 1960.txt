All right. Sam, that's $108,256.14. What's your pleasure, folks? We've hit it big, and we're buyin'! Sam, all this means to me is Jenny, and getting her up here. George, a wonderful thing about Alaska is that matrimony hasn't hit up here yet. - Let's keep it a free country. - You're backing down, Sam. - You're breaking your promise! - l never break a promise, but... l don't understand. Now you're a millionaire, you keep wanting to enslave yourself. - l can't wait to get enslaved, Sam! - Well, quit shakin', Uncle Tom. l'll fetch her back. Sam, darling! Georgie Pratt, the lovin' limey! Uh... No, thank you, lady. l'm spoken for. lt's all right, mister. Your virtue is safe. Billy Pratt. How you've grown. - Well, l'm glad it's noticeable. - How old are you now? - Not old enough. - Don't believe him. l'm 20, ma'am. You're 17, and you'll hold yourself in until you find the right one, like l did. What are you, my brother or my mother? George! Here, Sam. Have some of what you're buyin'. l always like free liquor! Hear you hit one of the biggest gold strikes around. We'll know better when l get back from Seattle with the heavy diggin' equipment. All right, folks. Quiet down. - Quiet! - Shut up! We'll drink to the twitchingest nose for gold in the whole territory of Alaska: my partner, George Pratt! And here's to George's fiance, who's been pinin' away in Seattle for three years waitin' for him to become a millionaire - Jenny Lamont! - When are you bringing her up, George? - l ain't. Sam is. That's like sending a rabbit to fetch you back a piece of lettuce! Somebody's gotta keep you thieves from jumping the claim. Anyway, - Sam's better at buying machinery than l am. - l'll tell you somethin' else he's better at! l gotta stay and build our honeymoon cabin. George builds the cabin, and Sam takes the honeymoon! All right, you've had your fun. l'll lay you five to one, George Pratt, your first kid has a squint and a wrinkled brow! That ain't very funny, mister! Girls! Hey, look at the dames! Hey! Girls! Girls? Hey! There's a whole shipload of new girls! - Not a bad fight, huh? - lnteresting. What l wanna know is, who's gonna pay for this mess? - Mess? - Ah, don't worry, greasehead. lt was worth it. Our Jenny has been vindicated. Oh, thank you, Mr McCord! Well, Clancy. Thank you. l'd better get steam-cleaned and shaved before l get on that boat. Sam, l'm relying on you. Don't you get drunk or arrested. - George, l gave you my promise. - Yeah l'll meet you on the beach with Jenny's ticket. - Good afternoon, gentlemen. - Howdy. l didn't expect to find luxuries of this nature out here. - Just come in? - Yeah, yesterday. Boy, it sure is hot! Say, didn't l see you about six months ago in Seattle? No. - Great town, Seattle. - Yeah. l hated to leave, but the gold fever got me packin'. lt's a big fever. Hey, that's all right! My name's Frank Canon. - Sam McCord. - That's a real dinger. ''Big fever''! Forgot my soap. Be right back. - Why, you thievin' little... - Wait a minute! l wasn't doing anything! Don't lie to me, you robber! l saw ya! - What are you doin'? l didn't do anything! - You thieving little skunk! - That rat was going through your clothes. - What's goin' on? - l caught a thief going through his clothes. - l'm sorry. The town's filling up with riffraff. l can't watch them all. Cool down, mister. He'd have come up empty. My money's in this bag. l'm sorry, but... dishonesty always makes me see red. No harm done. l'll buy you a drink. No, no. l always insist on buying the first one. The Canons have been like that as long as l can remember. My father used to... - You won't believe this! - What's the joke? While l was looking out for you, that bum robbed me! Took everything but my pants! - Uh, $5, please. - You strapped, mister? lt's embarrassing. lt's nothing serious. l'll get the money from the States in a few days. Won't hurt to lose a few pounds dieting. l forgot! Frankie's silver lining. l almost forgot it. l'll be able to get the money on that little bauble. You can get the money right here. For trying to save my poke, l'll give you a coupla hundred. - The diamond's worth $5,000 easy. - Well, how much do you need? There might be some delay in getting my money from the States. Say a thousand. Say five hundred. - You can't ask for better security. - Here's your five. Kinda foolish to trust a stranger with a hunk of diamond like that. Not at all, Mr McCord. l can always tell an honest face. - Yeah, but l'm goin' outta town. - Makes no difference. l'll be around when you get back. - What is this, corn or whiskey? - Just ask for what you want, mister. $5,000, eh? That crooked jeweller must have... must have switched stones? Well, l guess that... guess that about makes us even. - Not quite. - Hm? - l wonder what's happened to Billy. - That kid? He's probably tailing the dance-hall girls. Sam! Sam, wait a minute. Now, look. Here's your ticket. And, uh... here's a letter to Jenny. - lt's kind of personal. - l won't look! Well, you know how it is after three years. And here's her picture. Look at that face. Look at those eyes, look at that smile. The best part's missing: the figure. ''Nature's masterpiece'', l call her. l've been listening to this for three years. - Pretty near wore out lookin' at it. - Don't... don't bend it. And you will tell her that l have to stay here, and that l'm building the cabin? - l'll tell her. - l'm awful grateful, Sam. You don't know what Jenny means to me. All that gold in Alaska? Not worth her little finger! You know how it is. No, l never felt that way about a woman. But l'll take your word for it. Hey, mister! You for the Victoria Queen? - Comin' right up. - Shovin' off, sir. Sam... Sam, my whole life's in your hands. l'll deliver her to you, partner. Christmas wrappings. - You sure love that gal, don't ya? - Yeah, l do. More than... more than even you. - Come on, mister! - See you in a month. l sure fooled you fellas, didn't l? - Yeah. - Am l gonna make a big splash in Seattle! You're gonna make a big splash right here! No! Traitor! Everybody's trying to save me from everything! That'll cool him off! Thank you, Sam! You should have waited till you were further out! Oh, you fool kid! What do l have to do, put a chain around your neck? Well, it ain't fair. l'll be an old man before l learn the facts of life. Sam McCord never did a crooked thing in his life, and don't you forget it! Hey, mister. Mister? Mister! What did that man say about Sam McCord? - Why? Have you got something to say too? - Take it easy. - l'm Sam's friend. l'm his partner. - You are? Well, what do you know! This is a small world, isn't it? My name's Frankie Canon. Where is Sam? l heard he was in town. - l've been looking all over for him. - Sam's just left on a boat to Seattle. My name's George Pratt. This is my kid brother, Billy. This is an unexpected pleasure, bumping into Sam's partner. l'm going to have some grub. Why don't you join me? - Mighty friendly of you. - l'm a greenhorn in this town. l was kind of counting on Sam to help me... Well, you just follow me, Mr Canon. This is my lucky day. Come on. Are you, uh, sure this is 799 Perry Avenue? Oh, yes, sir. This is 799. Good old George. Bragged about everything... except that she was a duchess. - Yes? - Miss Jenny Lamont live here, mister? Deliver all packages in the rear. Tradesmen's entrance. l'm no tradesman. Tell Jenny l'm here from Alaska with tokens from George Pratt. - You are George Pratt? - No, l'm his partner, Sam McCord. Follow me, please. Where are you takin' me? Jenny? A gentleman to see you. Me? l do not know this man. - What does he want? - The name is Sam McCord, and l'm here as a representative of George Pratt. - Oh, him. - You'll be happy to hear he's in fine health, and l'm here to fetch you back to Alaska for the wedding. - The wedding? - Yes. l'm sorry, it is impossible. The engagement with Monsieur George Pratt is long over. Aw, Jenny, l've got a letter here that'll explain everything. Least it ought to. lt took him two weeks to write it. - What are all those packages for? - Those are the presents for the bride. And that's not all of 'em. These are just the doodads. The important ones are piled back in the hotel. But it is over. l am married. This is my husband. - Married? - Show him the ring, my love. Well, that stupid lunkhead George. Pinin' away for three years for you. He never laid a finger on anybody, just holdin' himself for her. A million dollars? ls this true about the strike? - A million dollars? - Sure. But a lot of good it'll do him, sittin' on a pile of gold, moanin' for his two-timing fiance. Um, a million dollars - you're sure? - A mill... - Yes. Women! l never met one yet that was half as reliable as a horse. - Please, sir, this way out. The back door. - l never use it. Another thing about Alaska - the polar bear. He can go for six months without any attentions. No! But after six months, a polar bear gets a little nervous, and starts clawin' up his fellow animals to death. Ohhh! Now, it's the same way with a gold miner. Reinforcements! That's what we like. Hey, Lil! Keep 'em comin'! Sit down, missy. l still have one unoccupied knee. You have a real snooty look, missy. And l don't like dames that have snooty looks. l met one female today who broke my partner's heart, and you are not helping me to forget it. l'm sorry your heart is broken. But we are all good doctors, aren't we, girls? Not my heart. George Pratt's heart. Broken right down the middle by a fickle dame in a lace cap. Let me be your doctor. Forgive the mistake. l should have seen that you're not the kind of man that would let a woman break his heart. You're too tall and too strong. - That accent. Where did you get it? - l'm sorry you don't like the way l speak. l didn't say l didn't admire your speaking. l was just askin', is it put-on or natural? - But it's natural. l'm French. - Yes, she is French. Pipe down. l'm tryin' to think. Real French, eh? Not one of them phoney ooh-la-las we get up in Nome? l'll give you 50 bucks for a straight answer. Girls, he's all yours. Good night, monsieur. ''Monsieur''! That does it. l buy. - Hey, hold on. Where are you going? - Let go. - You have enough admirers to... - Moody, too. George'll like that. - He hasn't got any sense. - Let me go. You're hurting me... l wanna talk business. Well, good night, ladies, and here you are. For being such nice girls and showing your legs and good dispositions. March 'em out, lrving. And, lrving, tell the management l'm through shopping for the night. Well, you've got a lot of drinking to catch up on. French. The real thing, just like you. - Well, l'm savin' a life, that's all l know. - Maybe, but you don't make any sense at all. Which is all right, because if you're too drunk to talk, we'll find something else to do. - That's perfect. You even sound like a wife. - l do not consider that a compliment. l'm on your side, lady. lt's my only politics: anti-wife. Any woman who devotes herself to making one man miserable instead of a lot of men happy don't get my vote. Sit down. Thank you. - What's your name? - l'm called Angel. - Sounds dangerous. What else? - Michelle. Michelle Bonnet. - And you? - Sam McCord. Sam McCord, l drink to you. Because l can always tell when l like a man. First, by my fingers. They get warm. Feel. Second, when he is willing to act like a gentleman for a few minutes. You know, when l was leaving before, l was only pretending. l was going to come back, and try again. Look, uh... l've got a proposition to make you. - Naturally. - Have you ever been to Alaska? No! Too cold for my type. l'm from New Orleans, where it's always warm. - You're about the right size. - Oh. You have second sight, l see. Try this on. Here? Don't you think there is too many distractions? - But if you wish... - Oh, l meantjust try it for size. Mr McCord, you're wasting your time. - l'm selling, not buying. - ''Buying''? How would you like to have all of this stuff free, no charge? And half a gold mine to go with it. Just say the word. - What word? - Just a little old ''yes'', - and it's all yours. - You're fooling me. l was never more serious in my life. l'm saving a human being, the best pal a fella ever had. Nobody has ever given me anything as nice as this before. When l heard that accent, l said ''That's for George.'' A Frenchie broke his heart, a Frenchie can fix it. l'm going to tell you a secret. l don't know, l'm shaking from head to foot. Because it finally happened. lnstead ofjumping into the bay, l'm going to jump into a gold mine. And, mister, am l going to jump! l mean, uh, Sam McCord, you really want me to go to Alaska with you? Just say the word. Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Come right this way, Mr Nordquist. He's right in here. Hey, Sam! Come up for air. Lars Nordquist! You old coot! How are ya? - l'm fine! How are you? - Come on in, svenska. Shame on you, hangin' around a place like this. Where else will l hang around when l'm looking for my old friend Sam McCord? - l heard that you hit gold in Alaska. - Big! Oh, l'm so happy for you! l see that you hit pretty good here in Seattle, too. - Oh, this is... What was that name? - Michelle Bonnet. Angel's easier. This is Lars, my old loggin' boss. - A mean man with an axe. - Hello, Mr Lars. Well, shake hands with her. Your wife ain't lookin'. How is Lena? Still bouncin' a rolling pin off your skull? Oh, she's slowing down. But she's crazy to see you again, Sam. Crazy to feed you up again. What are you doin' in Seattle? The whole gang is here for the loggers' picnic. We heard that Sam McCord was in town. Everybody starts hollering ''You can't have a loggers' picnic without Sam McCord!'' - Come on! - Well, uh... Go on, Mr McCord. l'll give you my address in case you want to see me again. The name is Sam, and l'm tattooin' you on my arm until we get to Alaska! Now pick up your trousseau, Angel, and let's go. l don't know where to begin. - Well, let's start here. - l'll help. Oh, it's such a lovely suit, Sam. And it fits so perfectly. Everything. The shoes, the hat... l hope l look all right for the picnic. - You look great for anyplace. Eh, Lars? - Sure, sure. What's the matter, Lars? You lost your laugh. No. Lena! Lena! You crazy, Sam! That's my wife. l bet you l know where Lars find you! Some all-kind-of-crazy no-good place! l told Lars ''You go find Sam, but you don't fool around with any of those fancy girls or l split your head open!'' ''Soon as you come home, l...'' Who is that woman? - Lars, l told...! - Wait a minute, Lena. That's my friend. - l brought her along. - She's no friend l know! Oh, stop that white-pack howl and show some manners. l want you to meet my friend Angel. - Well, come on. She won't bite. - Go on. See my Lena. - This is my old friend Lena Nordquist. - How do you do, Mrs Nordquist? Well, come on, come on. There's nothing to fear. She's half-human. Well, it looks like a very nice picnic, and... l'll just sit down on the grass, if you don't mind. - You ain't sitting on any grass around here! - You don't have to say any more. No, you don't have to. - Where are you going, Angel? - Where l belong. You belong with me. l thought we were invited to a picnic, not an uprising of nutty wives - with war paint - which l am not interested in attending. So my friend and l bid you goodbye, and are sorry that you find us unfit to sit on your lousy grass! - Lena! He's leaving! - Sam! - What? - Sam, wait a minute. You are a pig-headed no-good, and you always were! But you can't help it, just because no decent woman look at you for two seconds. But if you care for to stay at the party, it's all right. Her too! Well, that invitation's kinda uncordial. - l got the bad temper. - Well, so have l. How about you, Angel? Well... l... l'm kind of hungry, Sam. We got lots to eat, right down there - barbecued pork, if you like it. - Oh, l love it! - Right down there. Thank you. Hey! Where do you think you're going, Mr Nordquist? Well, what'll you have? A wing or a leg? The apple! Attention! All the men in the log-rolling contest please report to the committee now! Are you going to take part in any of the games? lf they have a wife-strangling contest, l mightjoin that. All wives are the same. You know, someone comes near their husband, and off they go, like burglar alarms! Well, what l can't stand is when people look down on others who aren't doing 'em any harm. Oh, Sam. You cannot change the world. And it's... it's so nice here, and that's enough. You're good medicine. Thank you. Refill? Yes - but not too much, hm? Be right back. Angel! Don't you remember me? - l'm Ole, the logger. - Oh, please go away. - l was going to come up to see you tonight. - No, l said please go away. - Nobody's looking. - l said go away! No! - l said go away! - No! Go away! Ohhh...! Let me go! Brought you some coffee, too. - Thank you. - Sit down? Yes. Wasn't that man a friend of yours? Sure. Still is - or will be, when he sobers up. - Well, why did you do it, then? - Habit, l guess. l guess a fella gets sore, and... What's the matter? Haven't you ever had a fella fight over you before? Well, over me, yes, but... never for me. Well, l... - l guess l got sore, that's all. - Why did you get sore? Well, how do l know? A fella gets sore, that's all! - He works it off, that's all. - Hey, Sam! Sam! Sam, Jensson's so drunk that he can't enter the pole-climbing contest. - You got to help me. - Yeah, he can't climb poles. - l got a big bet on with Oscar. - Me too! - What do you want me to do about it? - Climb pole! lf you don't help, l lose my shirt. l haven't had spurs on for who knows how long. - lt'll be like yesterday since you climb pole! - Or early this morning. - You might still lose your shirt. - l'll take a chance on you! Sam McCord climbs for Nordquist! - You ever seen a man climb a pole? - No. - Sam McCord climbs for Nordquist! - Well, it looks like l'm hooked. Sam, come on! - Sam, you're not going to go up there? - How do you think l used to make a living? - He go up there like a squirrel! - Ole? Hey, you bummer, Beyerhauser! Look out for my boy Sam here! lt's a fine thing you done to an old friend. You could have told me she was your girl, and l'd go away like a gentleman. l'm sorry, Ole. l apologise. Now l'm gonna ask a favour of you, like a gentleman. - What do you want? - l want you to take care of Angel. See no one bothers her. Give me your hand on it. Ja, sure! l kick the stuffings out of anyone who get fresh with Sam McCord's girl. Now l don't have to worry about ya. You got a chaperon. This way, Miss Angel. Ready... set... Go on! Sam, go! Come on! Quick! Quiet! Quiet, quiet! The winner for Nordquist, Sam McCord, in 58 seconds! Beer for everybody! We drink to Sam McCord, the winner of the pole-climbing contest! Wait, wait, wait, wait! You've drunk to me four times already! Well, make it five! Let's drink to one of the finest ladies in Seattle: Lena Nordquist! Thank you, thank you! And now let's drink to another fine lady. - Angel. - You betcha! Everybody drink to another fine lady - Angel! - Well, thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. - And a big drink to Sam McCord! Hold your horses! Hold your horses! l am still drinking to the other one! To you, Angel. Well... thank you, Lena. Thank you, Sam. All right. Now, come on, everybody, you're falling behind. Fill them up! We've got lots more toasts to drink! Yes, sir. Oh, my goodness! lt has started. Skall Now we make another toast: to the finest boss the loggers ever had! He's always treating the loggers like gentlemen - Lars Nordquist! To the finest boss, uh... the loggers, uh... He will have to pass. All right, so now we call on the best logger that ever run away to Alaska, Sam McCord, the Paul Bunyan of the pole-climbers! Well, l'm afraid that the Paul Bunyan of the pole-climbers will have to pass. Don't be mad on him. They were just having fun. - l will help you take care of Sam, honey. - Thank you, Lena. l'm sure l'll be able to take care of him myself. Oh, yeah. Sure. Good morning. What time is it? Noon of a beautiful day. This hotel's rockin'. - This is a boat! - Of course it's a boat. - Where's it going? - Alaska. Alaska. Oh. Music. l... l still hear music. The gramophone. l moved everything from the hotel, after l found the two tickets. Tickets. Tickets? Angel! - You came along. - You asked me. Don't you remember? Oh, Sam, it's wonderful! When l woke up this morning, l felt something wonderful had happened to me. l felt different. l felt like l used to be. Oh, Sam, you'll never be sorry. l'll take such good care of you. You may not believe it, but l can cook, l can sew... Hold it, honey. Hold it. l, uh... l remember, but... not quite the same way you remember. - ls there anything wrong, Sam? - No, nothing wrong. lt's just, uh... - Are you sorry you asked me? - No, that isn't it. lf l said anything to upset you, please tell me. No, l told you, you're fine. lt's just that there's some misunderstanding. l thought l told you about George. Yes, you told me his fiance left him, and he's heartbroken. That's right. His heart is broken, not mine. l thought you could help him, not me. Oh. - l'm sorry. l misunderstood. - Well, honest, l thought l told ya. You... you must have told me, but... l heard something else. l heard something nice. Well, l wasn't trying to hurt ya. l was trying to help. - And George as well. - Forgive me. l must have picked up some poison ivy on that picnic, and... just a little painful. l wouldn't hurt a kid like you for anything. l thought you were all steamed up about goin' to Alaska. Well, l... l think l've changed my mind. l... l'd rather go back where l belong. Let's have breakfast. Then we'll both feel different. No, thank you. l'm... l'm full up, l guess. Aw, come on. Open up. l'll play you a game of red dog. Cassino. l'll spot you ten points. Women. Peculiar. She's not answering the door, Mr McCord. - Should l slip it under? - No, l'll take care of it. ls she eatin' good? - Yes, sir. l'm taking good care of her. - Well, take better care of her. Thank you. Oh. Good evening, Sam. May l join you? Well, sure. Come on in. Sit down. How've you been? - l've been thinking things over. - Me too. - And l'm sorry l was so ungrateful. - Well, you had a perfect right to be sore. That was a dumb idea to begin with, dragging you along because l wanted to help a pal over some bumps. Let's just forget the whole thing. Besides, l don't wanna end up being a Cupid to any George Pratt. - Will he be very unhappy? - Huh! l'll get blamed for everything. He found the mine, he saved my life, and l let him down. That's the way this fella figures. He's very emotional. - ls he older than you? - No, he's younger. - He claims. - ls he big and strong? - Oh... - ls he fat, or short? - No, but, uh... - And he is rich? - Yes, he is rich. - That's very funny, - my turning down such a man. - Huh? Oh, please, forget whatever l said before. l'll be very glad to make your friend George happy if l can. No! lt's no good. - But let me try for a week or two. - No dice. This is what you wanted from the first time you saw me. Look, Angel, l changed my mind, the same as you. Why, Sam? Because it's a crazy idea, and l don't want you to get hurt, and... l like you. ls that a reason to get rid of a girl? lt's one of the best, unless you're a sucker for trouble. l'm not thinking of myself alone. You're a nice kid. l don't want to put you on the spot. - What kind of a spot? - Well, let's put it this way. Where there are two men and one girl on top of a mountain, it's trouble. And l don't think it's smart to import it. So let's just call it a boat ride, and l'll see that you don't lose anything for having taken it. Yes. Yes, l think you're right, Sam. lt would make your friend George unhappy if l fell in love with you, and who knows, maybe you'd feel unhappy if l fell in love with a nice man like George. So, the best thing is, l disappear from Alaska. Well, l'm glad you agree with me. How can l help agreeing with a man who's so kind and so honourable? And so wise. Good night, Sam. Good night. - Captain? - Morning, Mr McCord. - Have a nice trip? - No complaints. lt's going to take some time to get your equipment ashore. Yeah, l know. Uh, there's a personal matter, Captain. - Miss Bonnet. - Ah. Nice girl. - Sorry to lose her. - You ain't losin' her. She's goin' back to Seattle with you. But we are going up to Kotzebue before returning to Seattle. That's all right. She just came along for the ride. $300 be enough for a return passage? - Plenty. - There's $500. Two extra to kinda keep an eye on her. l'll watch her like a father, Mr McCord. And, uh... here's another $500. Give that to her when she gets off at Seattle. - Sort of a refund from the company. - l've got you, Mr McCord. They don't usually come that ladylike. Hey, hold it there! There's one more! Thank you. Thank you. - Good morning. - l thought you were gonna stay on the boat. Well, l thought so too, but then something said ''Go ashore, Michelle.'' - ''Go ashore, and your fortune will be made.'' - Did that something tell ya - that Nome is no place for a girl like you? - Like me? What is my kind of place, Sam? Well, l guess l've been taking care of you for so long that... l forgot you can take care of yourself. But it was fun being looked after, even for a little while. And l thank you. You're welcome. l guess l can see about a room at the hotel for you, for a parting gift. Won't you be coming into town from your mine? Oh, sure - once every six months. Oh, l... l see. l don't see George anywhere. Ooh! When he hears about Jenny, he's gonna get hysterical and bust me in the nose, or else try to drown himself. He's a nice guy, but about Jenny he just ain't normal. That's the trouble with being in love. Even drowning is a relief. - Oh, very funny. You just stay out of this. - Me? Of course. - l'm just going to have a hot bath and... - Hey, Sam! - Sam! - Breezy! You stay right here. Breezy! Where's George? At the mine. He wants you to bring Jenny there as fast as you can. - Something wrong? - There's been claim-jumpin' and cross-filin'. Him and Billy are sittin' up there with loaded guns. - That bad? - There's been killings, too. l was cross-filed myself last week. They took my poke, including everything. George gave me ajob, and l got a coupla wagons to help you haul that stuff off to the mine. Here are the invoices. Wait till they beach the equipment. l gotta go back to the hotel. l'm your man. Bags are just inside the door, lady. - You got $4 change comin', mister. - Forget it. You can't get a room. We're all filled up. - Hello, Mr McCord. - l'd like a room and a bath for the lady. l'm sorry, we're all full up. Everything's gone. Everything? Well, where else could l get her a room with a little privacy? You might try Phil's livery stable. They turned it into a hotel. A livery stable? l'll talk to Bish. He's the owner of the joint. Bish? Everett Bishop? - Over here, Sam. - Bish, l want... What kind of an outfit is this for a proprietor? l'm not the proprietor any more. One queen did it. One lousy queen. - You lost the hotel? - Sam, l had two aces back to back, and this guy had one queen showing, and it was the last draw. Now, l ask you, would you bet a hotel or not? One queen? Who pulled that third queen? - One lousy queen. - l'll paint you a skinny one. l don't want a skinny one, but l don't want one with a rear end like a bass drum! - All right, l'll paint a pancake! - You couldn't paint... Sam! Welcome to the Royal Palace Hotel. l'm rejuvenating the place. Art. l'm introducing art to Alaska. Along with dealing off the bottom? Sam, we're both rich men. Why do we have to quarrel? lf you and the lady would like a room... l'm out. The room is for Miss Bonnet. A room and a bath for herself alone. l'm sure l have just what you wish. l'd like to use this opportunity to wipe out all our past disappointments. As a friend of yours, she is a guest of the house. l'll take care of your luggage. Boggs? Boggs! That guy annoys me. Have you ever seen him before? Why do you ask? - You don't know him, eh? - No. - Well, watch out for him. - Why? Don't let him try to sell you anything. - l'll keep my money in my shoe. - Well, it's for your own good. A crook like that's bad news for everybody. Thank you. l appreciate your concern. Well, l... got to get out to the mine. You will come and say goodbye before you leave? l'll try. No hard feelings? No. Just something that didn't work out. Too loony, as you say. Well... Goodbye. Goodbye. Gold is where you find it ln the creeks or rivers Let's all get behind it And ossify our livers! Next time l catch you mooching drinks, you're fired. Now, come on. Take the lady's bags up to my suite. Miss Bonnet? - Can l, uh, open the window for ya, or... - Mr Boggs? ''Miss Bonnet''? Oh, that's wonderful! Angel, it's been a long time. Oh, you're onto something big. Come on, tell Frankie all about it. lf you kept a diary, Frankie, which l'm sure you wouldn't dare, you'd read where it says that you have no right to ask me anything. Oh, now, wait a minute, Angel. We've both got a lot to overlook. - You walked out on me. - l didn't walk. l ran. - No explanation... - Not even a wedding ring. l got fed up, Frankie. Fed up with being used. - Did you have to get rough? - You helped me to learn how, remember? Look, why the bellyachin'? lt didn't hurt you any. You're twice as beautiful as you were in New Orleans. You've turned out to be a real Venus. Don't l deserve a little credit? Oh, honey, it hit me real big when l saw you - right here. lt brought back everything. Those happy days and... nights. We're gonna start all over again, on a grand scale. Oh, so you're all hooked up, eh? - With Sam McCord. - Keep out of it, Frankie. Don't worry, Angel. l'm on your side. lt's hunky-dory with me if you waltz off with his gold mine. l'm no interference. l've my own interests. Sam McCord is yours, and the rest of the world is mine. Fair split? All l'm asking for is a little old-fashioned friendliness. lt's all gone, Frankie. Dead, like if it was never born. Oh... You're straight. - l've told you. - l never would have imagined it. You're in love with this big bum McCord. Look, let me give you a little friendly advice, huh? lt's no good. Don't change. You know what love does to a dame? Takes all the zing out of her. And that's respectability. That's the end. l'm asking you sincerely, be yourself. Don't wind up a Mother Hubbard, with a bunch of kids hollering in your ear! This respectability, it's not good for you. - Get out of my way. - No need to leave. l'm goin'. Keep the room. But l'm a patient man, and what's more, l have a lot of faith in you. Think it over. lf you ever need a little... friendliness, just call for Frankie. What's still out there? A donkey engine, some pumps, and the rest of the pipe. Me and the big wagon won't follow you out for another day. l don't give a damn. Just get it out to the mine. And don't hang around town and get drunk. - Drunk? You know l never drink on the job! - You can always start! What's got into you since we landed? You've been as ornery as a bear with a skinned behind! Well, l'm sorry, Breezy. See you out at the mine. Yah! Get away! l told you, get away from me or l'll scream! All l want to do is get out of here! And don't you lay a hand on me either, huh? You! What do l owe for that room? That ''private suite''. Everybody knocking on my door. What do they think l am? A part of the hotel service? No! Here! And take my name off your register! - But l don't understand. - Don't stop me! l'm getting out of here! - That tinhorn Frankie? - The hotel is full of Frankies. Well, l read her wrong. A gold mine. - Now where's that livery stable? - Are you crazy? - You can't sleep with horses. - And don't be insulting! l'm sorry. Forgive me, but l'm so upset. - l'll sleep on the beach. l'll sleep anywhere. - You can't. You'll catch cold. l don't care. l should have listened to you and stayed on the boat. l was a fool, l guess. Fine time to admit it, after the boat has sailed! l don't know what's the matter with me. l never cried like that before. l'll tell you what's the matter with you. You're a... a hoodoo! That's what you are, a hoodoo! Get in the wagon. Move over and quit bawling! - Where are you taking me? - To the mine. - But what about the boat? - l'll get you back in plenty of time. Yah! l could have been sittin' in his pants today if l only had a brain in my head. Yes, sir, Mr Canon. l built that shack up where him and George Pratt's gold mine is. lf l had drank less whiskey and more water from that stream, l'd probably have all that gold for myself. - Boggsy, you lived in that cabin? - Yeah. - Did you stake a claim? - No, l just ran a trap line. Then l pulled out because l was almost starvin' to death! Do me a favour, Mr Canon. Kick me. Kick me real hard. Wait a minute. Boggsy, you must have staked a claim. Now, think hard. Did you drive a stake into the ground? - Put together a pile of stones? - No! l wasn't interested in stones. Maybe a couple of little stones. - No. - Ah, you miserable drunk. Except when l was makin' a fire to cook on, l put a couple of rocks together. Boggsy! That's a claim! lt's your gold, and it's your mine! - You think so? - Oh, absolutely! You need a couple of drinks to help you think. l'll work it out with you in detail. Whoa, now! Oh, Sam! lt's beautiful! Beautiful? Gives me the willies. ''Welcome Jenny.'' Oh, his honeymoon cabin. How wonderful! You're gonna stick to your promise? No troubles? No troubles, Sam. l'm just going to enjoy the scenery. Well, l've done the best l can. l just gotta face him. - l think l'll just lie to him. - Yes. George! George! Billy! Billy! George! They're probably workin' the sluice boxes. l'll go dig up George. l wouldn't wish this on a goat, but right now l wish you were Jenny. l'll be right back. Hiya, kid. - Hold it! That thing's loaded. - Sam! Boy, am l glad you're back! Well, l'm not so sure l am. Where's George? Arnie, that fella who had the mine by us in Dawson? He's in trouble. - George went to give him a hand. - l heard about the claim-jumping. Some fellas tried, but Arnie run 'em off. But they swore they'd get a gang and come back. Breezy told me about some killings. l guess l'd better go over and give 'em a hand. Come on. Saddle me a horse while l pick up a few things. ls he that mad? He's not even here. Over at another mine, fighting some claim-jumpers. One good thing about that, them shootin' at him will take George's mind off Jenny. Yes. A bullet through the head is always the best cure for love. l gotta give him a hand. Keep me away for a while. - Are you going to leave me here alone? - Make yourself at home. Billy's here. - Who's Billy? - George's little kid brother. - How little? - 17. But he's man enough to take care of you. That's what l'm afraid of. This here's the best of them. He spooks a little now and then, but... But what? He... he thens a little now and spook... - ls that Jenny? - No, that's not Jenny. She'll be a guest for a few days, so get your bedroll outside. She'll sleep in the cabin. This is Billy, and that fleabag at your feet is Clancy. l'll be back as soon as l can, Angel. Take care of the mules. So you're Billy? Well, l'm Michelle. - What's the matter? You're cold? - Oh, no. Nothing's the matter. - Are you... - Am l what? ..Sam's girl? No. - You his sister? - No. - You're just a stranger, huh? - Yes, we met on the boat, and there weren't any rooms left in town, so Sam was kind enough to ask me up here - until l get my boat back to Seattle. - That's wonderful! l mean, it's wonderful up here. Clancy sure likes you. Now, don't you go away. l have to unhitch the team. - You stay here. l'll be right back, OK? - Yes. Come on, Clancy. lf you knew Only knew How this heart of mine Yearns for you lf you'd care Like l care What a wonderful love we could share lf your heart Felt like mine What a warm, tender love We could find How l long for your kiss But you don't know l exist lf you knew Would you love me too? Oh, Clancy! Now, get out. Behave yourself! Please get out. Clancy, shame on you. Behave yourself. Get out, OK? Get out. Michelle? Uh... do you want anything? - No. - Uh... Well, maybe some hot water. l... l just heated a batch. - No, thank you. - Well, it's no trouble to pour you some. Billy, l'm not taking a foot bath. l'm in the tub. - All of you? - Don't you open those curtains! Je... Jehoshaphat! All of her! 17. Just a little kid. Well! A... a welcome celebration to make you feel at home. - Here. You... you sit here. - Thank you. Oh, golly, you smell good! Thank you. Whatever you're cooking smells good, too. - l'd rather smell you. - Um... Shall we dine? Dine? Oh, sure. Excuse me. Silly. Venison stew. l'd love to taste it. Oh! Sure. How nice. Um... Does your brother allow you to drink? l've been drinking since l'm grown up. This here's French wine. George was saving it for Jenny, but... you being French, it's the same if you drink it. Let's say we knock off a couple. Are you willing? We'll see how the evening goes. Look at that! George wired up the cork so he'd know if l got into it. l hope nothing's wrong with it boilin' over like that! - You game to taste it? - Oh, l'm not afraid. OK. Mmm. lt's delicious. - How is it called? - Champagne. That's the only kind l ever drink. l guess it went down the wrong way, but... any way's the right way as long as you get it down. Here, have some more. There you go. Here's where l stand, Michelle. l got all the money l need. No sense me working any more. The next thing, gotta get myself a woman. - A steady woman. - Sure, while you're still in the prime of life. You said it. See that box over there? Right there? lt's full of gold. Take all you want. l'm through messin' around with Sam and George. From Fortymile to Dawson, l've known women from one end of this frozen glacier to the other. Blondes, brunettes, redheads... You name 'em, l've known 'em. Yes, sir, l've decided it's time for me to quiet down. Be patient. The right girl will come along. You know, l think a fella should be friends with an older woman. l just can't stand these young girls. You know, inexperienced, and nothing to offer. Mm-hm. Well, don't you think we should do the dishes and go to bed? Well, it's OK with me. l'm game. Fine. You go to bed, and l'll do the dishes. Aw, heck. What's... what's the big rush? l never get someone to talk to... girls, l mean. Just Sam and George, and all they ever say is pester me to clean somethin' or cook somethin'. Michelle... l want you to be more than just a talkin' friend. l don't know exactly how to put it. l understand. You want me to be more like a... like a sister. Oh, Michelle, please don't make fun of me. l'm serious. Michelle... l'm serious. l must be gettin' a little dizzy. Yes, l think so. You'd better lie down for a while. - Michelle... - No, no, no, no. Here you go. Come on. No, no. You can talk to me while l clear the table. All right? Thanks. Thanks, Michelle. Bull's-eye! Hold it! - Hold it! - They got Arnie. Hey, Duggan! He had this bundle of dynamite! Tryin' to blow up the sluices and drown us! - You dirty, claim-jumpin' thieves, you! - Arnie, you just don't understand. This is free territory. We've got as much right to the gold as you have. Get up there! Hold it! George! George Pratt! - Yeah? - All of ya! Come out of that cabin with your hands up, or l shoot Arnie. - The dirty rat would do it, too. - George, don't do it! l'd rather be dead than lose the mine to this scum! Oh, no! - Hey, look out for the wagon! Come on! - Hey, hold it! Come on, let's get outta here! - Arnie! - Sam. You all right? Sorry l busted up your sluice boxes. Looks like you'll be out of business for a while. Hell, it's still mine, ain't it? You'd better get him up to the shack. - Hiya, Sam! - Hi. - Hey, you big ox. Where are you going? - Oh, uh... nowhere. - Hey, how is she? - Who? Who? Jenny! l've been going loco. This last week, l haven't slept a wink. Hey, Sam. What did she say when she saw the honeymoon cabin? Well, George, she hasn't exactly seen the cabin. She hasn't seen it? What did you do? Leave her in Nome? - Now, we've been friends for a long time... - You mean you didn't even bring her? - l was gonna tell you a little lie, but... - You lousy Judas! - But l couldn't lie to a pal! - Pal? Oh, yeah, you're a pal. - You got drunk and never went to see her! - l didn't get drunk before, l got drunk after! Nuts! Now, you pay attention, George. l went to see her, honest. And l saw her, so help me. Are you listenin'? - Yeah, l'm listenin'. - Well, l saw her and her husband. - Whose husband? - Jenny's. She's married. - Married? - That's what l've been tryin' to tell ya. That's why l got drunk. And then l did a stupid thing, which l regret. Married! She couldn't wait. l'm not even worth waitin' for! l'm a lousy goose egg laying in an empty honeymoon cabin! l'll get you a drink. l got some in the saddlebag. Leave me alone, Sam. l don't even want to look at another human being. Leave me alone. l'll see you back at the cabin. Billy? Billy? Billy, it... Oh. Michelle? - Michelle? - Oh, no, Billy. Get away. Leave me alone. Oh! Oh, it's you. - Am l glad you're back! - What are you doin' in this bed? Billy. Little Billy. That's why l slept in this bed. He started feeling his wine - and everything else he could get his hands on. - Well, uh... But about this bed? - Oh, l know. The honeymoon bed. - Well, did you tell George about the lie? - No, l told him the truth. - And that was a mistake. - Did you tell him about me? Not yet, and that's why you'd better get out of this bed. George is a little sensitive about things right now. - l'll be in the other cabin when you get ready. - All right. Billy! Billy! - Michelle! - Michelle? Ya... dumb little big shot! - Sam! My head! l'm gonna die! - You're not that lucky. - Wait, Sam, please! Listen! - Well, this'll cure ya! Sam! No! - Sam! - Take deep breaths! Big drinker, huh? Big drinker? Well, drink! Now get outta here and take that wagon down to the sluice boxes and unload it, - like you shoulda done yesterday! - Yes, sir. Oh, Clancy. lf only Sam would look at me with your eyes. But he will. l will make him look at me the way you do. We gotta get outta here. George'll be back pretty soon. Well, l'm almost ready, if you help me button up my blouse. Why don't you get one of these things that buttons down the front? Would it be easier for you to button up? Shut up, you fleabag, unless you want to get dunked in the creek! Oh, don't be angry, Sam. You know, you're really very nice. - Did you ever realise you were? - All l realise is that we've got to get outta here cos George is coming back. Well, George is back! - Oh, hello, George. - What the hell's going on here? - Who is this dame? - A friend. Angel, this is George Pratt. - Hello. - Jenny couldn't make it, - but this... this tramp could, huh? - George, let me explain. l don't wanna hear anything you've got to say - and get off that bed! - You and your fancy bloomers. Out! - You lunkhead! lf you'd let me explain... - That perfume! She smells like... - l got that perfume for Jenny, - and those fancy bloomers, too! - But you gave them to her, huh? You big dumb ox! l was bringin' her back to you! l don't wanna listen to any more of... For me? She's French like Jenny, she's pretty like Jenny - if you ask me, she's prettier. Do you think that she could make up for my Jenny, take my Jenny's place? The idea was to console you, George. That's the way it started. - But we've changed our minds. - That's right. l'm gonna take her back to the boat, right now! OK, George? - Well, l don't know. - He's telling the truth, Mr Pratt. Get your stuff together and l'll go get the wagon unloaded. All right, Sam. Listen. For your information, l want you to know that... that l slept in this bed, and alone, because of your little brother Billy. Oh. Well, l'd like this opportunity to explain a few things, Miss... - What was your name? - Michelle Bonnet. You really are French, huh? Yes. Yes, l'm French, l'm a fool, and l'm also a tramp. - Oh, now, look. l apologise... - No need to apologise, because l am a tramp. Sam found me in a place called The Hen House, and l guess l'm going back to it. Well, do you... have to go back? lt doesn't matter. l do the same kind of work wherever l am. Do you have to? For whatever reason you begin when you start living this way, it's not very easy to live any other way... and not much chance. - l don't think it's absolutely necessary... - Yes, it's necessary. You see, perfume has a different odour on me. The pretty things l wear look better on me. You told me so yourself. Well, l said l was sorry for what l said before. Oh, you don't have to be sorry, mon chou. lt was all Sam's and me, and it was our fault. lt was enough for you to lose Jenny. - Hey, say that again? - l said you don't need to blame yourself... No. No, no, no. l mean what you called me. - You mean mon chou? - Yeah. Oh, it's nothing. lt's just a silly French word. lt means ''my little cabbage''. - Yeah. Mon chou. Jenny used to call me that. - Oh, l'm sorry. l didn't know. No, no, no. You don't have to be sorry. You know, it's strange. You remind me of her. Jenny, l mean. Well... l'd better be g... You know, you've got a lot of things to pack, and... l sure wish you'd stop being sore at me. l'd never have done it - if she hadn't said she wasn't your girl. - Done what? - l kissed her hand. - Oh, shut up! But Michelle's a wonderful girl, and l sure like her. l guess l made sort of, well... a beast of myself. So l heard. Well, a fella does some crazy things when he's been drinking, doesn't he? Say, why don't l take her into town, Sam? Sure. Then you can stay here and make up with George. Why don't you find the coldest spot in that hot creek and go sit down in it? And then change your clothes. Beat it! l gotta think. - Where's George? - He's takin' a bath. - Takin' a bath? - He's been soakin' for hours. l think he's goin' off his rocker. Oh, Genevieve My Genevieve The days may come, the days... - Hiya, Sam, old partner! - Well, that's more like it! - lt's good to see you smiling again. - Oh, l'm sorry, Sam. - l misunderstood. l couldn't stay mad at you. - Thanks. - l saw red for a minute. You know how it is. - Sure. Every cloud has a silver lining, Sam, except this one has a pink one, just like those fancy pink bloomers you gave to Michelle, huh? Well, the wagon's unloaded. l'll take her on into town. Oh, there's no need to do that. You can leave Michelle right here. - Why? - Now that we understand each other, just give things a chance to work out. - Work out? What? Where? - Here. - With Angel? - l like the French name better. Michelle. - Mon chou Michelle. - That's pretty. - lsn't it? - Bite it off! - George, you're makin' a mistake. - You brought her here for me. l may as well have a go at it. And besides, a man can't pine for a lost love for ever. But you haven't pined for a lost love for even two hours! You know, Sam, it's amazing the way she reminds me of Jenny. Before you make a fool out of yourself, l'd better explain some things to you. The Hen House? She told me, Sam. This girl is square, Sam! She's straight-out! l like this girl! Oh, Michelle. Mon chou, mon chou. - See what l mean? He's goofy. - l'm not so goofy. lt's been a long, cold winter, and she is like a breath of spring comin' through the window. lt may be true about that Hen House, but Angel isn't like those other girls. - You can say that again, partner! - What l'm tryin' to say is, you can't charge her like a bull moose chargin' for his mate! Thanks for the advice, partner. l'll hold the cards close and play 'em neat, right? Mon chou, mon chou, mon... Oh, l love that French! Mon chou, my... Now see what you did. Well, what did l did? You got poor Michelle so mixed up she don't know what she's doin'. And now George is in there with my girl! Ohhh...! May l come in? Of course. l'll be ready in a moment, Mr Pratt. Hey, let me give you a hand with that, huh? Oh, it's a handsome bed, and soft. - She would have loved it, l know. - Well, l'm glad you like it so much. - Uh, Miss Bonnet? - Well, l'm... l'm ready. You don't have to go. l mean, you could stay here. Oh, l'm sure there'll be some place in town where l can wait for the ship. l mean you can stay here... permanent. - Permanent? - Permanent. And be... be your girl? Oh, yes, ma'am! No, thank you, Mr Pratt. - Huh? - No, thank you. But... that's why you came here, isn't it? No, l didn't. Not to be your girl or... anybody's girl ever again. Not here, or in The Hen House, or anyplace else. - No? - No. Oh. Well, l'm not one to beg. - Well, l can see that. - You can? Oh. Sam... ls he gonna give me the horse laugh! He's gonna open his big mouth and laugh me out of the territory! ls that all l am - a game for you and Sam? Oh, no, ma'am! Not for me. No, no, no. - You're not a game for me. - But l am a game for Sam. Well... you know Sam and women. Yeah... l understand. Will you please take me into town? l'd rather not go with Sam. Sure. lt'll kinda save my face, won't it? - Can we go now? - Yes, certainly. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute. Aren't you forgetting these things? Well... l... l don't want them. Why not? Well, they... they're too rich, and too nice, and... - And Sam gave them to you, huh? - Oh, shall we go now? - Wait a minute. - l'd rather not wait. You shut up and let me think. That's it! You're in love with Sam! - Oh, no! No, l'm not! - Oh, yes, you are! You know, l've got a funny notion. Sam's been acting mighty peculiar. Tell me, how does he treat you? Well, uh... nice... as if l were... well, nice. Uh... Did he ever stuff money down the front of you? No? Did he ever try and smack you... uh...? - No. - ln Seattle, or on the boat, - did you and Sam...? - No! No? Oh, that's not like Sam! No, indeedy! You give me those. Now, you sit down there, and we'll stick this out and sort of see what happens. What are you lookin' at? Stop snoopin'! l was just wonderin' when they were comin' out to eat. - Sam, how long they been over there? - An hour and 28 minutes. Well, l'm hungry. Look out, here l come. He'll hear that. What have you got? - ''Chicka-Chickadee.'' - ''Chicka-Chick...''? We've gotta get something that'll really... Here it is. Here it is! - You want somethin' to eat? - Well, what for? For your stomach, that's what for! Turn it over, Sam. The other edge cuts. Sam! The stove's cold. Well, if that's the way you feel about it, cook your own food! - Sam? - Yes, Billy? - How do you feel when you're jealous? - Well, how should l know? - Well, l'm jealous. - Ohhh...! Where's that whiskey? Sam, do you think George is keepin' her over there, you know, against her will? Oh, sure. You can hear her screamin' for help, can't ya? - l just don't understand Michelle. - One thing you gotta learn about women: they're all liars. And if they ain't liars, they're worse, layin' for you with wedding music. Take that little dame from Oregon. All l was doin' was tyin' her shoelaces, and she starts beatin' me over the head with a preacher! Or that little thing from Minnesota, who tried to marry me while l was so drunk l didn't know what l was doin'. lf it hadn't been for the parson's mercy, l'd have been hooked good. For good! You just can't trust women, no matter how honest they act. They all wanna be wives. - Oh, but Michelle, she's... - Michelle, Michelle! Chou, cabbage - they're all alike! - l'm gonna take a bath! - But you just got cleaned up. Mind your own business! Oh, this is gonna kill him! Oh, poor old Sam. - Ouch! What are you doin' here? - What are you doin' here? - l love you - l was lookin' for my soap. - Let's you and l sing a duet. - Sing? One, two, three... Oh, no, George. lt's not going to work. Sam doesn't care about me. lt's that simple. Oh, come on, now. Don't give up. Have a little patience, mon chou, huh? Well, l'm sick and tired of both of 'em. Come on, Billy. Let's ignore 'em. Wait a minute. l got an idea. l'm gonna do a little reconnoitring. - Would you like some? - No. Da-di-da-da doo-doo l love you, l love you Sam! George is comin'! Di-di-di di-di Da di-di-da - George, l'm so nervous. - Oh, it won't be long now. He's in his silent period. l saw him once like this before, when somebody'd stolen his favourite horse. - Sam? You look kinda green. - l love you, l love you... You got an upset stomach, maybe? Sam? Well, maybe l oughta get you some baking soda. The time's just about right. Laugh. - What? - Laugh as loud as you can. - But... l don't feel like laughing. - You don't feel...? - No. - But he... Oh! - Are you ticklish? - No. Oh, what a marriage she's gonna have! Timber! - What's that? - lt's Sam. You stay there. When he lets out that war whoop, the Lord only knows what's gonna happen! l love you, l love you, l love you l was only saving the door, Sam. - Hussy! French floozy! - Oh, Sam, don't be a poor loser. Boy, does he love you! - Sam! - Hey! Don't chase him. He'll come back. Well, what were they doin', Sam? Oh, shut up! Sam! The soldiers are comin'. McCord-Pratt mine? l want to see the owners. - l'm Sam McCord. - The district of Nome is under martial law. Your claim has been cross-filed and will be under guard until the dispute is settled. There'll be no violence. Operations will cease immediately. Well, you've come just in time, soldier boy. There's no disputes here. l'm takin' my share and pullin' out! Hey, Sam! Two men! - No, you don't, mister! Put that gold back! - The hell l will! - All right, take his gun. - You can have the mine, - but a third of this gold... - All the gold is impounded, to be held until this thing is settled. But you're under arrest, McCord. l warned you, no violence. Sam, everything's gonna be all right. Just keep your head. Keep yours, or what's left of it! And keep the mine! And keep her! And keep away from me! Why, you pig-headed baboon! Wait. l have something to say to my partner. You're a knucklehead! Now, won't you listen to somebody about something? Save your breath! You've been ajinx to me ever since l met you! l've had it! Get me outta here! Jail me! Michelle? Excuse me. When are you going back to town? Just as soon as we load up with whatever's being impounded. - Could you take me along? - Why, sure, ma'am. Be glad to. - Thank you. l'll be right back. - Yes, ma'am. Mr McCord witnessed the weighing of his gold, but he won't sign the receipts. l'm not signing anything. The hell with the hearing. Let George Pratt fight for the mine. All l want is my share and to get outta here. Take off your hat, Mr McCord. Mr Commissioner, my name's Duggan. l'll sign my copy, sir. ls this the fella that cross-filed on me? He jumped Arnie's mine. - You're a lousy...! - That's enough, Mr McCord. That's enough! Mr Duggan has no lien on your property. He's only here to represent a Mr, uh... Peter Boggs. Peter Boggs? Who's he? He's the trapper that built the cabin on the site of your mine. He cross-filed. Let me talk to him. Why didn't he show up himself? That won't be necessary, so long as Mr Duggan is here to represent him. - Am l through, Mr Commissioner? - Yes. You'll be notified about the hearing. Thank you, sir. - When is this hearing? - ln about two months. Two months? lf you're interested in your share, you'll sign here. l'll sign. Let this office get about its business. Yours is not the only case we have to settle here. l'm gonna help you settle mine. Just a minute! You forgot something. Next case! Porter! Get the lady's bags out of the back and take them inside, please. Mister? ls that the Seattle boat? - Yes, ma'am. - But it's back early. Yes, ma'am. She had to turn back from Kotzebue on account of the ice. - Good luck, ma'am. - Well, thank you. Michelle. Michelle! - Oh, Billy! - Come here. l wanna talk to you. Come here. - What are you doing here? - l followed you, Michelle. l... Listen, l've caused enough trouble. Please go away. You haven't caused any trouble. lt was Sam and George! l can't get my share of the gold right away, but... l'll find a way to take care of ya. l can get ajob. Billy... you are a nice boy. - Aw, it's no fair sayin' that. - And l was almost a nice girl. Now, please go back to the mine. Everything is gonna be all right. Please. Well, Miss Bonnet. You didn't leave us for long. No. l'm taking the boat back to Seattle. - Do you know when l can go aboard? - Passengers can't load till midnight, ma'am. Well, do you mind if l wait here until l...? That won't be necessary. Mr Canon expected you. He kept your suite. - Expected me? - Yes. l'll show you to your room. This way. Please? Won't be a minute, sir. Neither will l. - What the...? - Where's Pete Boggs? - Let me go! - Boggs. Where is he? - l don't know! - Maybe this'll refresh your memory. - Boggs. - l don't know! - Boggs. - l don't know! - Boggs! - He's the porter! He's the porter at Frankie Canon's casino! Take over. l'm sorry, mister. Accidents will happen. Who is it? Welcome back, Angel. l'm sorry, Frankie. Please go away. l know how you feel. lt isn't every day a girl loses a gold mine. - May l come in? - lt's your hotel. - You look unhappy. - l have a headache. That's a natural reaction from pickin' a loser. We all make mistakes. Look, l didn't come to talk personalities. Just business. Are we partners? No. l'm taking the boat back to Seattle tonight. l don't get it. Back to where? The Hen House? Just because Sam McCord's a bum and you lost a gold mine, you don't have to leave Alaska. You've got brains. - You can have me, and money too. - l don't want your money. - Just me. - No. l don't want you either. - That's... that's madness. - Could be. You see, l'm running out of Alaska for the same reason l came. Because l'm stupid. Because l want to go on kidding myself that l am... different. That's all. Now, please go, and leave me alone. Yeah, well, you're just tired and upset. This is no time to decide anything. Maybe we'll have dinner. lt's a better time to talk. Sure. l'll pick you up at eight o'clock. And, uh... look real pretty. Eight o'clock. - Frankie? - Well, that was a quick decision. How long have you been holding this room for me? Since the day before yesterday, Angel. How did you know two days ago that Sam was broke? l heard a rumour around town that the mine was impounded. - Was it? - Yes. Well, you know l'd be lying if l said l was sorry. l'll see you at eight. Mister? Where's the porter? - l asked you where's the porter? - Out back there, of course. - Where'd you expect to find him? - Thank you. Glad to meet you, Bog... - Billy! - l haven't got her, Sam, honest. - What are you doing here? - Cleaning the gaboons. l'm the new janitor. - Where's the old one? Boggs. - l don't know. They told me he struck it rich. Yeah, well, he did strike it rich. He's the one that cross-filed on us. Frankie oughta know where he is. Sam, wait for me! l'm still a partner. - Do you know which room is Frankie's? - lt's up and around, and the suite in front. Who's there? Who is it? - That... that... that sounds like... - Yeah! Sorry to intrude in this fashion. - Well, l have nothing to say to you. - Or me. l'm here on a louse hunt. Come on out, Frankie. Gosh, Michelle. l didn't think you'd be here. Well, what did you think, kid? That she'd leave us and join the Salvation Army? Let's go find dear Frankie. Listen to me! Listen to this. And it's not for you. lt's for Billy and George. Frankie knew the mine would be impounded - even before the soldiers started up there. - What? How? Well, you're so smart, figure it out for yourself. Now, go on and leave me alone. Well, don'tjust stand there. Go find Frankie. - Me? - Beat it! l wanna thank you very kindly for the information. And then l wanna tell you you're the worst double-crosser l ever met! - First you double-cross me... - You? l double-crossed you? Me, with George. And now you're double-crossing your boyfriend Frankie! You're wrong about everything! Not once since l've met you have you been right about anything at all! Yup. That's my boy Sam, all right. Oh! You! Well, here she is. l found her for you - your nice, square, straight-out girl. - ln business again, as usual. - She's not my girl. l wish she was. - She's yours! - Oh, no, l'm not! Listen. We were putting it on for you. - No, we were not! - Of course we were! He won't believe you. He'd rather believe me! l wouldn't believe you on a stack of Bibles! No matter what else he is, George is not a liar. lf he says he's putting it on, he's... Wait a minute! You are a liar, - or why else are you here? - l'm looking for a fella named Boggs! - Ohhh! - Take it easy, Sam. Timber! - Take it easy. - Sam, l can't find Frankie, but Boggs is here, locked up in a room. - What room? - l don't know. Well, this is as good as any place to start. Hey! What is this? Take it easy. Billy! ls he in here? No. Don't give up, kid. This is promising. - Billy! - Oh, l can take care of myself. Gentlemen! What a pleasant surprise! - That's him! - You're just in time to have a drink. - We want to have a little talk with you. - Oh, that's good. Cos it gets very lonely here, you know. l got nobody to sing with. Let's all sing together, all right? Gold is found in every... What we wanna find out is why you've cross-filed on our claim. Cross-filed? l did? - Well, don't you remember? - Now, think. Didn't Frankie Canon ask you to do something for him? Frankie? No! He's the nicest guy l ever met. He gave me this whole room and all this whiskey, for nothin'! - All l did was put an X on a piece of paper. - You signed something? What did it say? l don't know. lf l could read, l wouldn't have to sign with an X, right? And Mr Canon told me l would never have to push another broom again as long as l live. That's enough talkin'. Let's drink and sing. Are you ready? Gold is found in every ditch... Come on. The commissioner wants to hear ya. - Does he like singin' too? - He's crazy about it. Gold is found in every ditch You tote and haul and lug... Wait here. l'll get Boggs, and you get him out of town as fast as you can. Hiya, Mr Canon! - We found your friend. - l'm gonna sing for the commissioner. - Come on with us. - Maybe you'd better come and listen. - l'm not interested. - You're gonna get interested. Get out of the way! Look out! Behind you, Sam! - You...! - What the...? Duck! Sam, look out! The Good Book says that man must love his fellow man. Music! Music! When the saints go marching in When the saints go marching in O Good Lord, l wanna be in that number... Hey, l want you! Get off there! - You're comin' with me! - Wait a minute! You! When the saints go marching in O Lord, l want to go up yonder When the saints go marching in - Gold is where you find it... - Save that for the commissioner. All aboard for the Queen of Seattlel All aboard! All aboard for the Queen of Seattlel When the saints go marching in - When the saints go marching in... - Shut up.
