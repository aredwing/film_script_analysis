You're Welcome. Is This Part Of Your Diet? Hey, Beat It. She's Not Bothering You. Ooh, She's Scared. Let's Go. Hey, You. What's Up, Chica? Nada. Just Kickin' It. You Know, First-Day-Back Blues. Heh. [Gasps] Oh, I Am So Sorry. Are You Ok? It's Fine. It's My Fault. I Just Got So Involved In The Book, I Forgot To Watch Where I'm Going. Oh. Could You Be So Kind As To Point Me Towards The Administration Building? Sure. Um, Yeah, You Follow Along These Buildings Here, Past The Jock Trophies, Up The Stairs. If You Pass The Faculty Room, You Went Too Far. Thank You. Thanks. I'm Sorry. Bye. [Hip-Hop Music Playing] Ooh, Yeah, Girl, You're Dustin' Me! All Right, Who's Got The Next Cut? Um, I Got It. Here. Where Are You Going With That Dumb, Girly Music, Esmeralda? Who Named You The Queen Of Music? As Long As I Got The Moves, I'll Be The One Pickin' The Tunes. Are We On The Same Page? And, Segura, Please Come To School With Your Pants Pulled Up. Nobody Cares What Color Your Underwear Is. Go To Class. Gomez! Gomez, Gomez, Gomez, Gomez. If You Put As Much Energy Into Your Schoolwork As You Do Into Goofing Off, You Will Be On The Honor Roll, My Friend. Yes, Sir. Direct Me To The Front, Colonel Zavala. I Will Sacrifice Myself For The Good Of The School. Dismissed. [Sighs] Hey. Hi. I Take It Principal Zavala Had A Previous Life In The Military. Don't Think The Kids Will Ever Let Him Forget It For A Minute. Good Morning, Ms. Bartlett. I'm Delighted To See You Actually Showed Up. You Had Doubts? Well, You Wouldn't Be My First New Recruit To Go Awol. These Kids Can Be Pretty Intimidating. After Watching A Dot-Com Company Crash And Burn, This Should Be Easy In Comparison. Don't Count On It. Thanks For The Reassurance. [Bell Rings] Remember, Ms. Bartlett, The First Day Is Usually The Most Trying. Good Luck. [Kids Chattering Loudly] So, Who's In Charge Here? Who Knows? Maybe No One. Oughta Learn More Than We Usually Do, Then. Yep. Ha Ha! What? Oh, Oh! Yo, That's Tight. You Better Quit It, Guys. You Want To Land Us All In Detention? Ooh, You Wouldn't Want That To Go On Your Permanent Record, Would You? Yeah! Go, Yoli! Oh, Oh, Go, Yoli! Oh, Oh, Go, Yoli! Go, Yoli! Go, Yoli! Whoo! [Whistles] [Banging Stops] Good Morning. [Boy Wolf-Whistles] My Name Is Ms. Bartlett, I'm Your New Biology Teacher. Boo! Nice Suit! Whatever! Good Luck! Can Anybody Tell Me What Biology Is? A Royal Pain. A Total Waste Of Time? [Kids Laugh] Biology Is The Science Of Living Organisms And Vital Processes. It's An Exploration Between Plant And Animal Life, The Laws And The Phenomena That... Govern The... Varied Species On The Planet. Am I Going Too Fast? Do You Have Any Questions? Why Should We Care? Yeah, And How Does It Matter To Us If Some Dumb Animal Goes And Gets Itself Extinct? We'd Be Better Off Busting Some Beats. Yeah! Yeah, Bump It! Oh, Oh! Go, Daisy! Come On, Daisy! Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh! Kids: Go, Daisy! Go, Daisy! Go, Daisy! Uh-Oh! Go, Daisy! Go, Daisy! Go, Daisy! Uh! Uh! Uh! Go, Daisy! Go, Daisy... Zavala: Attention! [Kids Stop Yelling] That's Automatic Detention For 2 Weeks, Starting Today. [Sighs] Gosh, That's Wack, Colonel. I'm Adding 2 More Weeks For Insubordination, Miss Salinas. She Wasn't The Only One Dancing. Would You Care To Join Her, Miss Vargas? Anybody Else? An Effective Leader Seizes Control Of Her Troops Immediately. Absolutely. [Sighs] [Kids Chatting Indistinctly] Hey, Did You Hear Ms. Renee Retired? What?! She Can't! What About Dance Team? It Ain't Gonna Happen This Year. But I Need It For College. It's The Perfect Extracurricular Activity. Ay, Pobrecita. Poor Thing? Not Me. Esmeralda's The One Who's Been Preparing For This Since Second Grade. Yeah. She's Gonna Freak. [Moonlight Sonata Playing] Boy: Es Mo. Junior! Junior, Give That Back! Junior! Junior! What Are You Doing?! Junior, That's Not Funny! Can I Have My Box Back Please? Esmeralda. What Are You Doing On The Floor? Mom, He's At It Again. [Spanish Report On Television] Did You Give Your Brother His Breakfast? Mocoso, Give That Music Box Back To Your Sister. Now... Andale. You'd Think That Silly Thing Was Made Of Gold. [Moonlight Sonata Playing] [Rap Music Playing] Hey. Hey. How You Doin'? School Is Such A Drag. Man, Do You Know How Lucky You Are Your Parents Let You Drop Out? Hey, I Tried Sticking It Out. Just Couldn't Hack It. Not That Working's So Much Better. Boss Always On My Case. Customers To Deal With. The Second I Can, I'm Gonna Be Right Out Here In The World With You. Yeah, Well, Don't Let Tu Madre Hear You Sing That Tune. She Already Thinks I'm A Bad Influence. Hey, You Wanna Kick Back After School? Watch Some Tube? [Laughs] I Wish. That Jerk Zavala Gave Me Detention For A Whole Month. Ooh. That's Harsh. But It Doesn't Come Close To My Record. When I Was In Ninth Grade, He Tried Keeping Me After School For 4 Months... Till I Weaseled Out Of It. How'd You Manage That, Slick? Oh, Put On My Best "So Sorry" Face, And Traded Detention For An Extracurricular Activity. Sweet. Yeah. Kinda Like You. Ok, Ms. Kim, I Made My Corrections. Would You Please Type That Up? No Problem. Thank You. Uh, Mr. Zavala, It Says Ms. Bartlett Went To Juilliard-- You Know, That Amazing Performing School In New York-- On A Dance Scholarship. Are You Filing The Resumes Or Reading The Resumes, Miss Reyna? I Didn't Mean To, Sir, But It Just Jumped Right Out. I Mean, I've Been Really Stressed Since I Found Out We Had No Dance Coach. Do You Even Know If Ms. Bartlett Would Be Interested? Well, Can't You Force Her To Do It? Well, Contrary To What I Try To Make You Students Believe, I Really Don't Have That Kind Of Power. All After-School Coaches Are Volunteers. But You'll Talk To Her, Right? Please? I'll See What I Can Do. Gracias. De Nada. Good Morning, Ms. Bartlett. Ooh, This Can't Be Good. I Have A Favor To Ask. It's Been Brought To My Attention That You Have A Background In Dance. Well, That Was A Long Time Ago. It's Not Something I've Kept Up With. Did You Know We Have A Ninth-Grade Dance Here At Marshall? And Our Squad's Been A Bit, Uh... How Do I Say This? [Chuckles] Ok, We Have A Statewide Reputation For Being A Perennial Disaster, But These Girls Are Counting On It. They Have The Enthusiasm. All They're Lacking Is A Coach. I Don't Mean To Be Rude, Sir, But If You're Angling To Get Me Involved, Let Me Save You The Breath. Dancing's A Part Of My Past. All Right, Then Let Me Try This Approach. Studies Show That Participating In Extracurricular Activities Help Keep These Kids Out Of Gangs And Give Them A Sense Of Self-Respect. I Understand. I'm Sure That's True, But Considering The Way Things Have Gone So Far, I Think It's Gonna Take All My Time And Energy Just To Focus On Reaching The Students In My Classroom. Well, Do Me A Favor. Please...Think About It. Ok. Yes, Esmeralda? Um... Well, I Was Just Wondering If Mr. Zavala Talked To You About Our Dance Team? He Did. So...Are You Gonna Do It? Are You Gonna Coach Us? Oh, Well... I Really Think I Should Become More Proficient In What I Was Actually Hired To Do Before I Take Anything Else On. Well, If You Want, I Can Tell You How Some Of The Really Popular Teachers Around Here Do It. Really? Mm-Hmm. I'd Like That. Will You Coach The Dance Team? Oh, Was That The Condition Under Which You're Going To Give Me Your Advice? Well, Yeah. You Help Us, I Help You. Why Not Make It So Everybody Wins. May I Have Your Attention, Please. The Chess Club Will Meet In The Library Thursday At 3:30. Bring Your Own Board. Ninth-Grade Dance Team Tryouts Shh! Will Be Tomorrow At 3:30 In The Gym. Be Sure To Bring Your Own Music. Any Questions, Please See Ms. Bartlett. Yes! Good Job, Esme. You Did It. Hey...What's The Deal With This Dance Team? Oh, You Hate The Whole Idea, Remember? Every Time I Ever Brought It Up, It Was, "Oh, That's Right. Losers R Us." Yeah, But Now I'm Thinkin' It Could Have Its Upside. Maybe Along The Way Develop Some Ol' School Pride. Check This Out. Whoa, You Feelin' Ok, Chica? [Sighs] Principal Zavala... I Was Out Of Line Dancing In Class, Sir. Don't You Think My Detention Time Would Be Better Served In A School-Sponsored Activity? That's Very Mature, Miss Salinas. Esmeralda? Since You've Been Spearheading This Whole Endeavor, Let Me Ask You. Do You Think That Daisy Would Make A Positive Addition To The Dance Squad? Well, You Definitely Gotta Give Her Props On Her Dancing. First Word Of Any Disrespect Or Lack Of Commitment That I Hear From Ms. Bartlett... Back In Detention. Slam Dunk. Assist: Esmeralda. [Bell Clangs] You're Welcome, Daisy. Whatever. "Dance Team Try-Outs"? Audicones? Ah. "Tomorrow 3:30 In The Gymnasium." Perfecto. Auditions. That's The Same In Any Language. I'll See You There. Man, Where Is She? Like I Don't Have Better Things To Be Doing. I Knew This Was Too Good To Be True. She Can Bail, So Can I. Chuy's Waiting. Heading Back To Detention, Miss Salinas? Good. Then Please Sit Down. All Of You, Take A Seat. I Cannot Dance Sitting Down. Rules First. Then You'll Dance. Every Team Member Is Required To Wear Her Gym Uniform, White Socks, And Clean Tennis Shoes. Like I'm Really Gonna Be Scrubbing My Sneaks. Thanks For Dropping By. Laces Tied, Shirts Tucked In, Hair Pulled Back Into A Ponytail Or A Bun. She's Worse Than Zavala. Seriously. Is This Dance Or Boot Camp? Girls Must Attend Every Practice, And You Must Be On Time. Sorry. I'm Sorry. I Had To Drop Off My Brother At My Aunt's House. Tardiness Is Unacceptable. No Excuses. No Team Member Is Allowed To Have A Failing Grade. A "D" Will Put You On Probation. That Leaves Us Out. Come On, Joanna. Let's Get Out Of Here. Adios. No Jewelry. No Dark Lipstick. No Long Painted Fingernails. Anybody Else Wanna Leave? Ok, When I Call Your Name, Come On Down And Play Your Music. Try And Keep Your Choreography To Under A Minute. Choreo--What? She Means Show Us Your Best Moves, And Don't Hold Back, Got It? [Guys Yelling] All Right, Let's Go! [Whistles] Excuse Me, Mr. Zavala, Do You Mind? We're Having Our Tryouts. We Practice In Here Every Tuesday And Thursday. Y-Y-You're The Basketball Coach? Somebody Had To Be. As I Was Trying To Tell You The Other Day, If We Don't Have A Little Faith In These Kids, How Can We Expect Them To Believe In Themselves? You Can Save The Lecture, Sir. I'm Here, Aren't I? And I Couldn't Be Happier. Good. So You'll Take Your Boys Elsewhere? Where Do You Suggest We Go? Well, I Don't--Sir, It Was Your Office That Scheduled Me To Be Here. Well, Obviously, Ms. Kim Made A Mistake. Ok, Sorry, Ladies. Dance Team's Been Canceled. What? I Don't Believe It! No. Hold On. Wait A Minute. I'm Not Gonna Make It That Easy For You To Quit. So You'll Let Me Have The Gym? You Can Have Half Of It. We'll Take The North End. You Can Have The South End, And The Half-Court Line Will Be Our Divider, All Right? Ok. Ok, Guys! This Is Just Something I Came Up With On My Own. So Here It Goes. Player: Sorry! Second Player: Whoops. Obviously This Isn't Gonna Work. Obviously. You Were Here First. We'll Leave. No, You Need The Baskets. Good Point. And We Can't Get Much Done Without Music. [Mariachi Music Playing] [Hip-Hop Music Playing] Come On Come On Ai Yah Come On Come On Come On Ai Yi Come On Come On Come On Ai Yah Come On Come On Come On Ai Yi [Swing Music Playing] [R & B Music Playing] Candy Lover You're So Sweet Candy Lover You're The One For Me Yeah Ok, Esmeralda, Thank You. Thank You. That Was Great. Nice Work. That's It For Today. What About Me? Well, I Already Know You Can Dance, Miss Salinas... In My Classroom, Remember? What I Don't Know Is Whether Or Not You Can Be Part Of A Team. What's That Supposed To Mean? It Means No One On My Squad Gets To Be The Diva. You All Have To Work Together, Help Each Other To Improve. Oh, And One More Thing... If I'm Gonna Give Up All My Time To Be Here, I Expect You To Be As Serious And As Dedicated As I Intend To Be. I Don't Compete Unless I Plan To Win, And That Can't Happen Until You Girls Get Into Shape. So Tomorrow We'll Meet On The Track. 3:30 Sharp. If You're Gonna Be Late, Don't Bother To Come At All. Ok, What Now? One More Lap. Oh, Wait. I'm Sorry. I Forgot. Did We Join The Track Or The Dance Team? It's Important To Build Up Your Stamina, Daisy. Oh, Ms. Bartlett, I Seriously Don't Mean Any Disrespect, But Our First Dance Competition Is In 2 1/2 Weeks. Don't We Kind Of Have To Get Started On A Dance Routine? Well, Considering I Haven't Been Around This Kind Of Meet Since I Was In School, I Was Sort Of Hoping We Could Figure That Out Together... When The Time Comes. Well, I Know The Routine They Used 2 Years Ago. My Sister Taught It To Me. It Goes Like This. Daisy, Chanting: Go, Yoli. Go, Yoli. Go, Yoli. Go, Yoli. Go, Yoli. Go, Yoli. That's So Tired. I Mean, Why Don't We Invent Something Totally New? Yeah, Want More Flash! Yeah, With More Flesh! Sorry, Don't Think So. What If We Start Out With Something Like, Uh...Like, Up! You Have A Comment There, Miss Salinas? No, No, No. It's Fine, You Know, If You're Entering An Old Granny Competition. Maybe You'd Like To Show Us Some Of Your Ideas? No Problema. Ooh, Yeah, Daisy! You Go, Girl! Yeah, Girl. Go On, Daisy! Let's Try It. Daisy, I'll Never Be Able To Move Like That. If I Do That Many Turns, I'm Gonna Puke. Guys, She's Just Showing Off To Make The Rest Of Us Look Stupid. Oh, Yeah? I Don't Have To Dance To Do That. Well, You Know What? I've Got An Idea. Why Don't You Pack Up Your Attitude And Get Lost. Why Don't You Back Off Before I Make You Back Off. [All Yelling At Once] Hey! You Guys, Hey! Hey! Excuse Me! You Made Your Point. Thank You. So, Look, I'll Stay Here And I'll Think About Our Routine While You Girls Give Me Another Lap. [Muttering In Spanish] [Coughing] Are These The Pompoms? God, Who Was The Last Person To Use These? Cleopatra? Well, It's Better Than Nothing, No? Speaking Of Nothing, What Happened To Our Old Team Uniforms? Mr. Zavala's Looking For Them. But Until Then, You Guys Will Wear Your Gym Uniforms This Weekend. Oh! What? Ms. Bartlett-- What? I Hear A Lot Of Schools Do That. Yeah, Lots Of Poor Schools. You'll Be Judged On Your Dancing, Not Your Outfits. Either Way, We're Toast. What Are You Talking About? I Think Our Routine's Pretty Good. Please. Our Routine Is Safe And Boring. Excuse Me, But It Makes More Sense To Start Out Modestly Than It Does To Get In Over Our Heads. Whatever. You're The Coach. Look At Them. They're Like Pretzels! Start Stretching. Ms. Bartlett? I'd Like To Introduce You To My Parents. Hi. We Figured Our Girls Deserved To Have Someone Here To Cheer Them On. Well, I Hope We Don't Disappoint You. This Has Been So Good For Alyssa. With Our High Hopes For College, Every Little Extracurricular Activity Helps. P.A.: Rolling Hills Junior High School Dance Team Onstage. Marshall Middle School, On Deck. What Is "Deck"? It Means We're Next. What's With Them? I Don't Know. We'll Find Out. Girl: Let's Go, Girls! Squad: G-O-O-D L-U-C-K, Good Luck! Rolling Hills Wishes You A Lot Of Luck! [Cheering] [Dance Music Playing] Computer Voice: 1, 2, 3, 4. Squad: Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ms. Bartlett. Esmeralda's Sick. Oh! Hey. Hey, What's Wrong? I Can't Do This. I'm Gonna Throw Up. Oh, It Was A Long Trip. Do You Think You're Bus-Sick? P.A.: Marshall Middle School, Up Next! Ok, No Time. I Want You To Breathe Through Your Nose And Try And Fill Your Lungs. It's Probably Just Nerves. You'll Be Fine. You All Will Be. P.A.: The Marshall Middle School Dance Team Onstage! You Think You Can Do This? Um, Yeah, I'll--I'll Do It. Here's Your Poms. Here. Go, Go, Go. Good Luck! Cd! Focus, Everybody. I'm Ok. Hi. It's The Second Track. [Applause] Buenos Das. Ahh, Mr. Zavala, What Are You Doing Here? Curiosity, Moral Support. Mm. Hmm. [Techno Music Playing] 2, 3, 4, 5! Daisy: And 5, 6, 7, And-- All: Marshall! Daisy: Come On! Give It Up! Unh! Daisy! [Music Stops] [Light Applause] We Stunk! You Think?! It Could Not Have Been Worse. Daisy-- You Know What?! Save It. I Quit. I Would Have Rather Been In Detention. Alyssa-- This Is The Most Embarrassing Day Of My Life, And My Parents Are Here! You Girls Did Fine. This Is All New. You Had First-Time Jitters. Rome Wasn't Built In A Day. You'll Get 'Em Next Time! It'll Be All Right. Ok? Pretty Disappointing Day, Huh? We'll Keep Working. You Know, Ms. Bartlett, I Know This Whole Coaching Thing Was Sort Of, You Know-- Well, Everybody Really Pressured You Into It, But, I Mean, If You Really, Totally Hate It... I Don't Hate It, Esmeralda. Is That How It Seems? Yeah, Sorta. But-- What? Well, Me And The Other Girls Were Talking, And Don't Take This The Wrong Way Or Anything, But It Feels Like There's A Whole Lot More You Could Teach Us, And For Some Reason... You're Holding Back. This Won't Take Long. I Just Need To Get My Backpack. Man, Even Being Here When I Don't Have To Be Makes Me Start To Sweat. Yeah, I Know What You Mean. Come On. Good. It's Still Here. Well, Since I Drove, Does It Mean You'll Treat For Burgers? You're The Big Working Man. Yeah. The One Who's Always Hurting When The Bills Are Due, Remember? Shh! Shh! Do You Hear That? Hear What? Who Would Be In The Gym On A Saturday? Who Cares?! [Music Playing] You Can Make It If You Try Wondering What He Has Got To Think Of Me There's Nowhere To Go But As I Don't Doubt Your Fears Are Missing I Think You Should Know It Won't Be Long, Baby, For You To Discover You're A Step Away Hey, Hey! Hey! You Know That Lady? That's Her. Who Her? That's My Dancing Coach, Ms. Bartlett. That's Her! Oh, She's Hot. Ohh! I Meant Her Dancing. She's Really Good. Yeah, Not That She Ever Gave Us The Slightest Clue. She's Your Dancing Coach, And You've Never Seen Her Dance Before? Not Like That! [Slams Car Door] Don't Give Up, Don't Give Up You Will Make It Through Mm-Mmm [Music Ends] [Crying] Hey, Yolanda. Daisy, May I Have A Moment? I Already Turned In My Lab Assignment. It's About Dance Team. I Quit. Can We Talk? I'd Really Like You To Rejoin Us. Why? So I Can Make A Total Idiot Out Of Myself In Front Of 5 Or 6 More Schools? You Have The Potential To Be Great, Daisy. Do You Know That? Look, I Only Joined This Dance So I Could Get Out Of Detention. Now That's Done. Well, What About The Other Girls? They Deserve To Have Somebody With Your Talent, Your Strengths. Isn't That What They Have You For? Oh. No, Wait, I Forgot. You Only Dance When Nobody's Looking. I Saw You In The Gym On Saturday. I Hadn't Danced For A Really Long Time. It Kind Of Stinks That You've Been Holding Out On Us. There's A Lot About This You Don't Know Or Understand. And Whose Fault Is That? You're Right. But Everyone Deserves A Second Chance, Huh? [School Bell Rings] I Gotta Get To Class. Ok, Ladies, Rolling Hills... Is Gone. Today, We're Gonna Start From Scratch. Are We Actually Gonna Dance Today? Yeah, We Are Gonna Dance Today, But Rhythm Is First. I'm Gonna Break This Down Into What's Called An 8-Count. And 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-- I Can't Hear You. [Together] And, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Good. Everybody Up! Off The Bleachers! We've Got A Lot Of Ground To Cover. We're Gonna Isolate Different Parts Of Our Body, Starting With The Head. And 1, 2, 3, 4... Chin Down... And Up Again... Good, Esmeralda, Good. Alyssa, Try And Keep That 8-Count In Your Head. I Know This Is Gonna Feel Awkward, But Don't Worry About It, Just Go With It. Let's Go With The Hips. And Side, 2, 3, 4... And Circle... And Circle... And 1, 2, 3, 4... And Circle... And Circle... And Side, 2, 3, 4... And Circle... And Circle--Good! Now, Let's Stretch. Ready? And Stretch Side... 2, 3, 4... Circle Around... Come On Up... And Side, 2, 3, 4... Circle Around... Come On Up. Good Job. Shake It Out. Loosen It Up. Miss Salinas. I'm Really Glad You Decided To Rejoin Us. [Starts Cassette Player] [Music Starts] All Right, Yolanda, You Want To Dance Today? Let's Go. Then We're Gonna Dance. 5...6... 5, 6, 7, 8. Now Turn Around. You Can Make It If You Try [Laughter] 5, 6, 7, 8! [Music Playing] 5, 6, 7, 8! Good Job. [School Bell Rings] Ms. Bartlett? Yoli And I Were Wondering If You Thought Any More About The Meet At Hamilton Next Saturday? Nope. But Why? We've Been Working Like Maniacs. And You've Been Performing Really Well, All Of You. So Why Can't We Go? I Need You To Be Patient. We Don't Want To Be Patient. We Want To Compete. We Want To Win. I Know. I-- I Just Don't Think It Would Be Fair Of Me To Get Your Hopes Up Before I Thought We Could Really, Really Deliver. The Next Competition We Go Into, I Want Us To Be The Absolute Best. She Said No Way. She Doesn't Think We're Ready. I Knew It. We're Totally Ready. You Know, I Think We Should Just Go On Our Own. I Know Where They Keep The Registration Forms In The Office. But How Do We Get There? We'd Never Get A Bus Without Ms. Bartlett. We Can Have Chuy And His Boys Drive Us. Oh, Yeah. Like My Parents Would Ever Go For That. The Point Is That We Don't Have To Tell Them. Ok... Wouldn't It Just Be Easier To Try To Convince Ms. Bartlett That We Really Are Ready To Compete Again? How? Hold On. I've Got An Idea. [Telephone Rings] Mrs. Kim? Yes? Hi. I Have A Note For Ms. Bartlett. Can You Please Show Me Which Box Is Hers? Sure. This Way. Alyssa: Thank You. Is This The Only Bartlett We Have At Our School? Yes. Thank You. Mm-Hmm. Dance Team: Whoo! [P.A. Playing Dance Music] Daisy: And 5, 6, 7, 8! Daisy: Go, Ladies! Ms. Kim, Who Put On That Music? I Have No Idea. Ms. Bartlett, What's Going On? I Don't Remember Scheduling Any Performance For This Afternoon. I Think The Girls Are Trying To Prove That They're Ready To Compete Again. Drop It... Say What? [Music Ends And Applause] So, What's Your Opinion? I Don't Think They Can Be Considered Ready For Anything Until They Learn To Respect Their Coach. [Laughing] Locking Up The P.A. System? Taking Over The Lunch Area? How Do You Think That Makes Me Look? It Makes You Look Good! Didn't You Check Out The Way Those Kids Were Looking At Us? A Team Is Supposed To Work Together With Every Single One Of Its Members, Including Its Coach. Does That Mean Hamilton's Out Now? Hamilton Was Always Out, Yolanda! You Girls Absolutely Refuse To Listen To Me! What Are You So Afraid Of? The Only Explanation I Owe You, Miss Salinas, Is That We Are Not Going To Hamilton Because I Say We're Not! By The Way, Mr. Zavala Finally Found The Old Uniforms. I Have A Feeling They May Need Some Work. [School Bell Rings] My Mom Had All This Left From A Job. She Said Anything We Can Use, We're Welcome To. I Hope Somebody's Good At Alterations. Well, I Think We Definitely Need To Spice These Up A Little. Yeah! Put Some Sparkle! Make Them Look-- Hot? Right, So That We're All Dressed Up With Nowhere To Go. Yeah. What's Ms. Bartlett's Problem? I Think The Whole Idea Of Performing Poorly Really Freaks Her Out. Well, If She's Waiting For Us To Be Perfect, She Shouldn't Hold Her Breath. Want To Hear What I Have To Say? Esme... You Sent In The Registration Forms, Right? Um...Yeah? So, Who Needs A Coach? Let's Just Get Ourselves To Hamilton And Kick It Up! If We're Going, We'd Better Get Going. Do You Think There's Any Way Ms. Bartlett Might Just, Like, Show Up There? Why? You Guys Didn't Say Anything To Her, Did You? Are You Kidding? She'd Flip If She Knew We Went Behind Her Back Again. You Guys, Can We Seriously Pull This Off? Come On! It's Like My Grandmother Always Says, Si, Se Puede. Yes, She's Right, You Guys. We'll Just Chant "Yes, I Can." Si, Se Puede. [Together] Si, Se Puede. Si, Se Puede. Si, Se Puede. [Cheering] Come On, We're Late. Coming! This Is Crazy. We're Gonna Get So Busted. Relax, Chica. Piece Of Cake. Welcome, Ladies. What School Are You From? Daisy: Marshall Middle School. Oh, Terrific. Your Coach Has To Sign In. Our Coach? She Is Here With You, Isn't She? Um, Yeah! Sure! Why Wouldn't She Be? Right. Um... We--We're Really Late Getting Here. Um, We Got Lost Along The Way, And Our Coach, Ms. Bartlett, She, Um... She Went To The Little Girl's Room And... She Wanted Me To Sign Us In. Splendid. We Thought You Were A No-Show. You Were Supposed To Be Here An Hour Ago. We're Here Now. Follow Me. There's A Ahead Of You Onstage. You're On In 5. Minutes? Who's Gonna Start Our Music? Remember, There's Gotta Be Someone There To Hit Play. Give Me The Cd. See The Console Over There? When It's Our Turn, You Hand Him The Cd, You Tell Him It's Cut Number 3, Ok? And When We're Ready, I'm Gonna Nod To You From The Stage, And You Hit Play. Cut Number What? 3, Chuy, 3! I Know, I Know, I Know. I'm Just Messing With Your Head, That's All. No, Please, Don't! Come On! I'm Under Enough Pressure As It Is, Ok? Ok. Ok. Peninsula On Stage, Marshall Dance Team On Deck! 5, 6, 7, And-- G-O-O-D L-U-C-K Lots Of Luck! Come On! [Applause] [Music Starts] 1, 2, 3, 4 It's Petroleum Jelly. Do It, Girls! [Together] Let's Go, Peninsula! Here We Go Come On, Girls! Work It! Open Up. Yuck! What Are You Trying To Do, Poison Me? It Helps Remind You To Smile. I'm Smiling. All: Together! [Music Stops] Here. Let Me Help You. Thank You... For Handing In The Registration Form. You Know, For Getting Us Here. Ok! Let's Huddle Up! Ms. Bartlett Taught Us The Moves And Got Us Acting Like A Team. Now, We Can Do This! All Right? Si, Se Puede. [Together] Si, Se Puede. Si, Se Puede. Si, Se Puede. Go...Marshall! Whoo! P.A.: Marshall Middle School Dance Team, Onstage! [Applause] Go, Marshall! Ready? Ready? [Music Starts] [New Song Starts] [Together] Go On! [New Song Starts] Let's Go! [Together] Yes! [Applause] Excuse Me? May I Have A Word With You? Look, If It's About Our Coach-- Actually, Dear, It's About You. That Was An Incredibly Impressive Performance. Thank You. You Can't Possibly Imagine How Hard Our Team's Been Practicing. It Most Definitely Shows. You Can Trust Me On This. I'm One Of The Judges. No Lie? I'm Lynell Elliot, Dean Of The High School Of Performing Arts. Daisy Salinas. Pleasure To Meet You. Daisy, You Are Very Talented. You Have An Ease And Charisma Onstage. Please-- Oh, It's True. I See A Lot Of Girls At These Competitions. Is There Any Chance You'd Be Interested In Attending Our Academy Next Year? Whoa. Wow. You Know, My Mom Would Never Be Able To Afford Something Like This. We Have Scholarships. There Are A Hundred Paths To Working It Out If It's Something You Truly Want. [Girls Cheering] 26 Schools. Third Place. Not Too Shabby. My Turn To Hold It! I'd Like To See Ms. Bartlett Tell Us We're Not Ready To Compete Now. Alyssa's Father: Excuse Me, Girls? Why Weren't You Girls On A School Bus? Where's Your Coach? Do You Have Any Idea How Out Of Our Minds We've Been? How Could You Lie To Us Like This, Alyssa? Mom, I Didn't Lie. Well, You Certainly Didn't Tell Us The Truth. Do You Even Know These Boys? They Hardly Look Old Enough To Have Their Licenses! Mom, Look At Us. We're All Fine. And What Do You Think Mr. Zavala's Gonna Say When He Hears About This? Dad, You Can't! I Can, And I Will. Now, Let's Go! Come On, Ladies! You Guys Just Won Third Place! [Car Drives Off] Ya Le Vo. Como Estabas? Entran. [Door Closes] Where Have You Been? We Won A Trophy! We Came In Third. We Had To Stay For The Award Ceremony. You Know, Your Mother And I Are Due At The Acarmens For Dinner. You Agreed To Baby-Sit For Us. Ok, Well, I'm Here Now, Aren't I? But You Still Have To Cook Your Brother's Dinner. You Haven't Cleaned Your Room In A Week. Maybe This Dance Is Not A Good Idea. Mommy, It's A Great Idea! Whenever You Have To Be At Work, I Cook, I Clean, I--I Wash, I Do Everything For Everybody. Why Can't I Just Have One Thing For Me? Esmeralda, Do Not Speak To Your Mother In That Tone. I'm Sorry. But I Was Really Happy Today. And Nothing You Do Can Take That Away From Me. [Sighs] She Did Win. Daisy. Hi. I'm Sorry To Bother You At Home, But I Really Need To Talk To You. Mm, Well, After The Phone Call I Got From Alyssa's Parents, I'd Say The Feeling's Mutual. I Don't Think You Girls Have The Slightest Idea Of The Terrible Position You Have Put Me Into. You Went Against My Wishes. You Defied My Authority-- Do You Know That Alyssa's Parents Think I Am Completely Incompetent? We're Sorry. We Messed Up. We Just Had To Get Back In The Competition. Even If I Wasn't Sure You Were Ready To Compete Again? Then How Come We Got Third Place Today, Huh? I Mean, Doesn't That Count For Anything? That Is Beside The Point, Daisy! I Can't Be Your Coach If I Don't Have Your Respect And Your Trust! Respect? Nobody Feels Like You Believe In Us! Ohh. My Whole Life... From The Time I Was 4, All I Wanted To Do Was Dance. I Took Lessons, I Got A Lot Of Positive Feedback, But Every Time I'd Perform In A Recital, Even At Home, My Parents Would Say The Same Things. "That Was Good, But You Can Do Better." "Don't Settle For Good. Be Great." "We Expect You To Be The Very Best." So, I Worked Harder, Kept Practicing, Kept Taking Lessons. And Was Kicking Enough To Get Into Juilliard. Mm...Yeah. Want To Hear A Little Secret? 2 Weeks. But Esme Told Me That You Graduated? She Read My Resume, Which Says I Attended Juilliard. Daisy: Why? I Don't Get It. Why Would You Quit? I Was Good. But-- But Not Great. I Went To Those First Couple Of Weeks Of Classes, And I Saw The Other Students... Their Passion... And Their Incredible Technique, And I Thought-- I Freaked Out. I Thought I Don't Belong Here, I Can't Compete With This. I Felt Like Such A Fraud. So, I Packed My Bags And Flew Home, Went To College, And... Got An Internet Job. How'd You End Up At Marshall? Oh, Well, Yeah. Last Summer, My Dot-Com Company Folded. I Saw This Ad Begging For Teachers. Boom. When We Were At Rolling Hills, Every Cold-Sweat Nightmare I Had Ever Had Came Flooding Back To Me. When Everything Fell Apart, I Knew I'd Failed You Guys. I Didn't Want You To Compete Again, Because I Couldn't Handle It. This Isn't At All About Not Believing In You. I Hate That You Thought That. This Is Me. It's My Stuff, My Fears. Hey... Whose Routine Do You Think Got Us That Trophy Today? Daisy-- We're Not So Dumb To Think We Can Do This Without You. We Want To Keep On Going. I Don't Know About That. If We Pull Through In The Next 3 Or 4 Weeks, We Have A Chance To Make It To Regionals. I Realize That. I--I-- Ms. Bartlett, Si, Se Puede. What's That? It's Our Team Chant. Marisol Taught It To Us From Her Granny. Si, Se Puede. It Means "Yes, I Can." Si, Se Puede. Si, Se Puede. The Truth, Mr. And Mrs. Cortez, Is That The Girls Made Some Definite Errors In Judgment. But I Made An Even Bigger One. I Didn't Show Nearly As Much Faith In Them As They Deserve. Well, We Appreciate You Coming To Talk To Us Like This. Well, Alyssa's A Terrific Girl. And I Think The Dance Team's Been Really Good For Her. For The First Time, She Not Only Has Books, She Has Friends. Oh, That's Great. So, How Do You Think We Should Tell Mr. Zavala About This Little Incident? He's A Busy Man. He Has Enough To Be Worried About. Thank You. I Promise From Here On Out, I Will Be With The Girls Every Step Of The Way. Every School Rule Will Be Followed. Gracias, Ms. Bartlett. No, Really, Thank You. Thanks. So We're Still On? We Can Compete Again? Step Into The Party Look Across The Room Chillin' With Your Friends Couldn't Help But Notice You Checkin' The Time... So, I Need You To Choose 3 Numbers From Your Tribes And Send Them Down Front. The Winning Team Has No Homework Tonight. All: Yeah! Whoo! Tonight Run My Fingers Through My Hair Slowly Walk Right Over There I'm Shakin' My Hips... Get Ready... Get Set... Go! [All Talking At Once] Shake, Shake Move To The Rhythm Dance To The Beat The Feeling Is Right Tonight Gotta Get On Your Feet Tonight Shake, Shake Move To The Groove Now Dance Up Ahead I Just Want To Dance With You Gotta Get On Your Feet Whoo Tell Me Your Name Let's Talk For A While Just Can't Resist That Beautiful Smile My Wish For Tonight Tonight Is Dancing With You With You Baby, Take My Hand My Hand And Make It Come True Shake, Shake Move To The Rhythm, Dance To The Beat The Feeling Is Right Tonight Gotta Get On Your Feet Whoo Let's Go! 1, 2, 3, 4! Don't Look Now, But You Might Actually Be Getting Good At This. [Laughs] Well, I Found It Works Better If You Let Them Be A Little Hands-On. So How's The Dance Practice Going? Great! The Girls Are Really Working Hard. Ms. Bartlett: Ok. That's It For Today. [Sighs] Hey, You Wanted To See Me? Daisy... How Come You Didn't Tell Me You Had An Offer From Lynell Elliot? Oh, Come On! The High School Of The Performing Arts. That's The Most Incredible Place! Yeah. It's Also A Zillion Miles Across Town. So? So, It's Probably A Bunch Of Stuck-Up Rich Kids With Mommies And Daddies In Show Business. How Am I Supposed To Fit In? What Happened To "Si, Se Puede"? [Laughs] Please. Chuy Thinks It's A Stupid Idea. Chuy... Hmm. Is He The Boyfriend? Yeah. Plus, He's Bent At Me Enough For Spending So Much Time With Dance, You Know? And He Thinks I'm Being Set Up For Something I Can Never Achieve. Hmm... What Grade Is This Chuy In? None. He Dropped Out. He's A Mechanic Over At Escobar's. Which Pretty Much Means His Future's Been Decided For Him. Is That What You Want? Daisy... Listen, Take It From Somebody Who Has Been There. This Is The Time In Your Life When You Should Be Seizing Every Opportunity, Following Your Dream. Don't Make The Same Mistake I Did, Ok? [Screaming Joyfully] We Did It! We Did It! We Came In Second! We're Going To Regionals! Ohh! We're Going All The Way To San Diego! All Praise Ms. Bartlett! Hail Ms. Bartlett! Thank You, Ladies. I Will See You On Monday, And Then--We Are On To Regionals! All: Yay! What? Regionals? Does That Mean This Thing Isn't Over Yet? It Would Have Been If We Hadn't Placed Today. But You Did. Yeah! Don't Sound So Excited For Us. I'm Gettin' Really Sick Of This, Girl. Oh, Yeah? You Never Have Any Time For Me Anymore! You're Always Dancing Or Practicing Or Too Busy Or Too Tired! Chuy, Why Can't You Understand? Dance Is Finally Giving Me A Chance To Do Something With My Life! What About Our Life? What About All Our Plans? I'm Just A Kid! I Don't Wanna Be All Settled! You Know, Who Knows What's Gonna Happen? I Know! You're Gonna Go To That Snotnose Actors School. They're Gonna Chew You Up And Spit You Out, And You're Gonna Come Limping Back Expecting Me To Be Waitin' Here For You? Well, You Know What? Bag That, 'Cause I Have A Life, Too, And If You Don't Wanna Be A Part Of It, Then You're Out Of It! Chuy, Wait! You Know What Ms. Bartlett Told Me? She Said That Ever Since She Quit Juilliard, She Wondered Every Day What Would've Happened If She Stuck It Out. Every Day, She Wonders, Chuy! I Don't Wanna Wonder! I Wanna Know! Well, Good For You. Buena Suerte, Chica. Eh? Chuy, Don't Do This! [Tires Screech] Answering Machine: This Is Lynell Elliot. Please Leave A Message After The Beep. [Beeps] Hi. Miss Elliot? This Is Daisy Salinas From Marshall Middle School. I Met You At The Hamilton Dance Meet. I'm Calling Because I Would Very Much Appreciate It If You Would Send Me An Application To Your School. Thanks. [Crying] What Do You Mean We Can't Go? I Mean, This Is Everything Those Girls Have Worked For. I Understand, But There's Not A Single Dime Left In The Budget. Well, What Are We Talking About, A Bus? One Bus For One Day? How Much Could That Possibly Cost? Because We'd Be Going To San Diego, Which Is Outside Our District, I Have To Get A Liability Rider. Then There's The Cost Of The Driver, The Gas, The Bus Itself-- But This Isn't The First Year You've Had A Dance Team. Why Wasn't This Put In The Budget From The Start? But This Is The First Year We've Had A Dance That's Even Come Close To Being In The Regionals. Sir, What Am I Supposed To Do? Punish These Girls For Their Success, Tell Them If They'd Only Gone And Failed, Everything Would Be Fine? I'm Very Sorry, Ms. Bartlett, But I Don't Know Where I'm Gonna Get My Hands On $1,200. Ohh. [Sighs] What If We Raise The Money Ourselves? Yeah. Maybe We Could Even Raise Enough To Get New Uniforms. We Could Have A Car Wash. Yeah. And We Can Sell Food And Stuff. Like A Block Party! Guys, We Have To Do Whatever It Takes To Get To Regionals. We Have A Lot To Do In The Next 2 Weeks. Like Come Up With A Whole New Routine. Actually, You Guys, I Was Thinking About That. How Would You Feel If We Did Something Really Innovative By Taking Advantage Of Your Background? You Mean, Something Like This? I Did It Since I Was Old Enough To Walk. My Mother Call It La Lavadora. The Washing Machine. Yeah! A-And How 'Bout The Merengue, Like This? That's Perfect! That's It! That's It! Who Else? Anybody Else Have Something? My Parents Do The Cha-Cha. It's Like... Cha-Cha-Cha Ms. Bartlett: Ok, Watch Daisy. Do You See How She Makes It Her Own? She's Going From Cha-Cha To Hip-Hop, Back To Salsa... Flamenco... Mmm... Unh...Salsa. Cool. Now, How Do We Turn It Into A Routine? Yeah, And How Are We Ever Gonna Learn It On Time? Well, Let's Figure That Out. Daisy, What Do You Think? We Start Up Here, Bring It Down... And Hip, Salsa, Pirouette... Come On, Girls, Try This With Us. Merengue... And Do What You Were Doing Before, Ok? And Cross Over. Ok, Perfect. Spin Around, And... Shake, Shake, Shake! From The Top--Up! Arms Up, Bring It Down, And Pop The Head--Salsa... Pirouette... Oh! Alex! What Are You Doing Here? I Have To Tell You, You Are Not The Easiest Person In The World To Track Down. Ohh! Come Here! Let's Go Inside. Ok. Get Some Tea. Are The Rumors True? Are You Teaching Now? Ninth-Grade Biology. [Laughs] Unbelievable! And You're Digging It? Yeah. It Definitely Has Its Challenges. Well, You Know, The Reason I'm Here-- I Was, Uh, Talking To Bob Humphrey. From Medico? Exactly. He's Now One Of The Hotshots On The Web. His Web Site-- It's Huge! It's Gossip, Advice, Fashion Tips-- You Know, All The Stuff For Preteen Girls With Links To The Best Clothes, Cosmetic, And Music Sites. It's Unreal! And? And They're Looking For A Head Of Customer Relations And Marketing... Hmm. And I Told Them About You. Oh... Well, Alex, That's Really Flattering, But... I Think I'm Starting To Hit My Stride With This Teaching Thing. How Much You Making? Enough. If I Never Wanna Take Another Decent Vacation Again. Hey, Whatever You're Pulling In, Bobby'll Double It--At Least! I Mean, He's Had A Hundred Applicants, But No One With Your Skills Or Experience. Now With This Teaching Thing On Top Of It... Your Students Are His Core Demographic. I Don't Know, Alex. I Don't Know. Give Him A Call. They Even Have An Office In London. Hmm... Ahh, You'd Love London. Give Him A Call. Take An Interview. What Can It Hurt? I Guess There's No Reason Not To Just Meet The Guy. Exactly. Right... Give Him A Call. Alyssa: How Can You Be Failing Math? It's Only The Term Progress Report, Not An Actual Report Card. Look, Mr. Zavala Is Totally Crazy About This Stuff. Any Failing Grade Means You Can't Be On An After-School Team. Yeah, But Even He Wouldn't Kick Her Off Right Before Regionals. Wanna Bet? Stupid Math! It's Always Been A Pain! What Are We Gonna Do? Well, Let's Just Talk To Ms. Bartlett. I Mean, Maybe She Can Pull Some Strings. Chicas! Listen Up. Bad News. What's Going On, Marisol? I Hear Ms. Bartlett Talking On Her Cell Phone About A New Job. That's Not Possible. Marisol, Are You Sure You Heard That? S! I Know My English Will Not Be So Perfect, But My Ears, They Are Fine. She Never Wanted To Be Here In The First Place! We Were Just A Paycheck Between Real Jobs! Daisy, That's Not True, Ok? I Don't Believe It! Look, We Never Should Have Trusted Her! You're Wrong! Ms. Bartlett Cares About Us-- A Lot! Yeah, Right. She's Staying Here, Ok? I'll Bet Anything. This Can't Be Happening! It's Over! No, It Isn't! Uh, Ladies? Hello? So, Have You Come To Make Your Farewell Address To The Troops? I'm Sorry? Once A Quitter, Always A Quitter. We Know You Had A Job Interview. Marisol Heard You Confirm It. Is It True? Are You Leaving? You Can't! What About Regionals? So, Did They Offer You A Lot Of Money And Tell You That You Were The Best? Actually, It Was An Extremely Generous Offer, And They Asked Me To Start On Monday. Bye. We're Really Gonna Miss You. How Could You Do This To Us? I Thought We Mattered To You. Mr. Zavala Won't Let Us Go Anywhere Near Regionals Without A Coach! After All Our Hard Work! This Is No Fair! Can I Get A Word In? Why Bother? Actually, The Truth Is, I Turned Them Down. You Really Did? So, You're Staying? Yeah. [Laughs] Why? We're A Team. Ms. Bartlett: So... Are You Ready? Are We Gonna Practice? Um, Actually? We've Got Another Problem To Figure Out. Well, What If We Considered This One, Big Extra-Credit Project? Yolanda Can Collect All The Money Tomorrow At The Car Wash, And I'll Check Her Calculations. If She Gets It Right, Then You Can Talk To Her Math Teacher, See If He'll Raise Her Grade To A "D." That Could Work. But You Have To Get Her To Take It Very Seriously. If Yolanda Doesn't Deliver An Accurate Tabulation, She's Off The Dance Team. You Got It. Ms. Bartlett... I Like Your Optimism. Thanks. [Sizzling] Boy: Give Me A Piece Of That Chicken. Enjoy. Thank You. Hey! I Washed So Many Cars, I'm Gonna Have Pruned Hands For A Month. Yolanda! So How Are We Doing? Collecting's Easy. It's The Counting And Adding That'll Be The Tricky Part. Let's See. Aah! [Laughs] Oh, Wow! [Laughs] So, Are We There? Did We Do It? Close, But... No Cigar. Well, We Have Enough For The Bus And The Insurance, But We Still Need Another $100 To Get The Uniforms. [Car Horn Honks] Chuy... What's With All This? Somebody Told Me You Were Having A Little Trouble Reaching Your Goal. Yeah, Well, Where Did You Get All These Cars From? Escobar's Garage. The Old Man Has The Repairs Washed Every Time He Turns Them Out. I, Uh... Talked Him Into Throwing The Job Your Way. So, What's The Damage Gonna Be For 9 Cars And A Van? $85. Well, That Still Leaves Us Short 15 And Some Change. You Owe Me A Wash And Wax, Girl. Done! Ms. Bartlett: Congratulations, Team. We're All Going To Regionals! Whoo! We're All Gonna Look So Fine In Our New Uniforms! All: Whoo! Here You Are, Daisy Salinas. I've Been Looking Everywhere. I Cannot Tell You How Delighted I Was To Receive Your Application, And I'm Looking Forward To Seeing You Dance Today. Ah, Great. No Pressure. Oh, This Is My Coach Ms. Bartlett. This Is Lynell Elliot. Oh! It's Really Nice To Meet You. A Pleasure. Well, I Won't Keep You. I Know You're Busy Preparing. I Just Wanted To Say Hello, Wish You Good Luck, And Let You Know I'll Be Watching. Uhh... [Laughs] You Guys, I Cannot Believe We're Actually Here. I'm Gonna Faint. I'm Gonna Fall Right Over Into A Dead Faint. Not Before We Compete. Dance First, Faint Later. P.A.: Los Alamitos Dance Team On Deck. Marshall Middle School Up Next. [All Talking At Once] [Squeals] P.A.: Good Afternoon, Ladies And Gentlemen. Welcome To The Southern California Regional Dance Finals! First Up, The Los Alamitos Red Devils! Girls: Whoo! [Cheering] Woman: Y'all Ready? Dance Dance Dance Dance Girls: Yeah, Yeah! [Music Increases Tempo] Girls: Dance, Dance! Girls: Yeah! [Applause And Cheering] Esmeralda: You Guys? You Guys, I Can't Find Our Pompoms. Where Are Our Pompoms? I'll Go Look Over There. Ok, You Go That Way. I'll Go This Way. Go. Yeah. I Can't Do This. Mmm, Of Course You Can. No. No, I--I Can't. Lynell Elliot Is Out There. Daisy... You Know How Good You Are, And, Uh, I Know You Know What Today Could Mean For You, But... Let Me Tell You Something You May Not Know. It Certainly Took Me Long Enough To Figure This Out. There Is A Big Difference Between Being The Best And Being Your Best. Aiming To Be The Best Is-- It's Fruitless. It's A Matter Of Opinion. But To Be Your Best? That's Where You Find Your Spirit. Look, The Best, My Best-- What's The Difference? I Can't Do Any Of It! Sure You Can. You Have Done This 50 Times In Rehearsal. Do You Know The First Time I Saw You Dance-- In My Classroom-- You Had Such Joy. You Danced Straight From Your Heart. And Do You Know There Is More Value And That's More Contagious Than Having A Thousand Trophies. So, Today I Want You To Forget About Winning And Forget About Lynell Elliot. Forget Everything... Except Why It Is You Want To Dance. Remember, Sweetie, Follow Your Heart. Si, Se Puede! Hey, Girls! Good Luck, Ok? Hang In There. Bye! P.A.: Please Welcome The Marshall Middle School Dance Team! [Applause And Cheering] Go, Marshall! 1, 2, 3, 4... Girls: 5, 6, 7, 8! [Music Starts] [Gasps] Come On, Daisy... Let's Go! Girls: Go, Go, Go! [Applause And Cheering] Girls: Come On! Let's Go!

And Then Internationals! No Matter What Happens After Today, You Girls Are Amazing! Well, Maybe 'Cause We've Got An Amazing Coach. Hey! To Ms. Bartlett. No. To Us. All: To Us! [All Laughing And Talking] Can't Believe You Drove All The Way Down Here. Oh, You Thought I'd Miss This? I Thought You Hated Everything About My Dancing. No, Chica. You Know What I Hated? Feelin' Like I Was Gettin' Left Behind. Feelin' Like You Were Gonna Get Out And Go For The Gold, And I Was Gonna Be Toolin' Cars Till I'm Toothless. But Guess What? This Dropout's Droppin' Back In. Chuy, Are You Serious? Well, I At Least Gotta See If I Can Do It. I Am So Proud Of You! Eh... Right Back At Ya. I'll See You Up Front, All Right? Ok. You Were Great. Yeah!
