PRODUCTION DESIGN Ladies and gentlemen, move it. It'll be a great day. See you later. Bye. - Where's Mel? - He doesn't answer. MUSIC EDITED BY Mel, what is it'? Excuse me, sweetheart. I have to... Oh, no, my dear. I've been waiting for my gift far too long. Honey, I'm back! I've got a carp. Merry Christmas. DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY Merry Christmas. DIRECTED BY We have here Kazik from Warsaw, on the line. - What would you like to ask Santa for'? - I want my dad. To thank him. I was sad, and my dad remembered about me. - I've got a Superman. But with no head. - Maybe he has a great heart instead. That happens. Has your dad given you a Christmas gift already? Yes, for the last year. Dad has sent it. So this year you'll thank him yourself. Will he spend the Christmas Eve with you'? - He's far away. - I'm sorry. We'd like to be together on Christmas Eve. Your dad is missing you for sure. And if he can't come, he must have very important things to do there. He's saving the world? It's quite possible. Greetings to Dad, who's saving the world. And who loves his little son Kazik very much. IT IS NICE TO SEE YOU Thanks to you we've managed to collect the money for Malgorzata's surgery in Switzerland. - My contribution was minimal. - Don't be so modest. I wrote the song because someone inspired me. And Tosia here took care of the rest. We owe our success to her and her incredible energy and her faith that her mom will get well. Don't be so modest, Tosia. Malgosia, we wish you health, and beautiful and merry Christmas. - And get back to us soon. - Mom has to stay in the hospital until the operation. A suicider. Or perhaps not'? And? You loser! "Loser?" Come on, boss. We're on. Come on! Give it back. A present for you. Call us. Santa is waiting for your letters. There isn't much time left. Remember, you can't buy happiness. This is the bad news. The good one is, you can get happiness for free, if only love finds you. Misiek's eyes look like dinner plates now, but it's true. - Fiddle-faddle. - When loves finds you, - you have Christmas every day. - Don't believe him. Men are like stupid sheep. Excuse me, pigs. I see that Misiek is ready to turn off the mic. Is it on? You're the best presents for one another. Misiek, don't look at me like that. - Dad got carried away. - My son Kostek says that. He asked me to dedicate a song to a young and lovely lady. Wiktoria, especially for you, from Kostek: "What the world needs now." Well, master, my respect. Kiddo has fallen in love. First love. Flowers and hearts. I can't stand listening about Wiktoria any longer. Oh, my Romeo. It must be Victoria. Hello? How are you, honey? - Hello? Are you there? - Yes. Hi. Is anything the matter? Has Kostek gotten into mischief? - No. Why? - You're silent. I'm busy now. I need to go. Bye. Bye. Where are you going? To what mountains? - The Tatras. - It's out of the question. I can't... lam not going to give you your coat. How much chance do you give me'? If you give up the treatment... Zero! I have little time... as you know. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Have you called Mom? - She doesn't answer her phone. - She's depressed. - She watched it for sure. I doubt it. What matters now is that she makes it to Switzerland. - Everything will be all right. - Give my greetings to Monika. - Love to Mom. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - No, not here. - It's good. - Only here. - Mom. Oh, so sweet! You have a date with a school student? - It's not your business. - Anything is possible on the net. - Don't be so envious! - Of what for that matter? - My figure. - Mine will be better when I'm your age. Mine was better when I was your age too. He'll drop dead when he sees you. Wow! I'm dating the wrong Lisiecka. - Smart ass! - Oh, Mom! - Is it cute'? - Yes. Hey! - I'll check once again. - It's very important. I know. - I hate Christmas. - Mel, I have a client! My queen, please, give me 200 in advance. - Let me work. -What's wrong? - I'm in a hurry. - You got some yesterday. - Please, have mercy. - 9a Pelplinska Street... Apartment 3. - Whose address is it'? - Mine. - Any problem? - No. I'll take it. - But I won't take you. - Why? What's wrong with me? - You scare kids. - Whose? Not mine, as I won't hire you. Even if you pay me. But I don't have anyone else. In that case - thank you, no. - Sir, wait! - Mel! - You have to be in the Arkadia Mall. - Sir, don't get offended. Give me 200 zloty, and I'll get you a Santa costume. You might not like me but you want your kid happy. My son turns 4 today too. How do you know how old my son is'? Santa knows everything about every kid. And remember: Kazik is not your kid. He's mine. Got it? My son. - Mel? - I'm going to see my son. - What about the nativity scene? - Sheep is missing. But I know a guy who breeds ostriches. Vladi, relax. I'm almost there. Yes, Matylda is with me. I'll be there in 5 minutes. Bye. Redo! Redo! - What are you doing? - Will you keep an eye on it? Merry Christmas! I'm sorry! Magma! Magma! Magda. Hi. Hi. Don't you really recognize me? Last summer, Mazuria, Mikolajki, a sailing boat. - That's you. - Oh, yes. On a yacht. - You shagged me. - What? Oh, it wasn't you? Of course, it was you! Robert Redo Bartosiewicz. Magda. - What are you doing? - I was passing through Warsaw with my sheep Matylda and I saw you. My heart was pounding, I felt butterflies in my stomach, I crashed my car and now I'm running around the Mall to... to." We have to meet one day. I texted you, you didn't answer. I've changed my number. Have you? What did you write? It doesn't matter. - May I'? - Oh, you're here. This is Magda. We ran into each other. And you wanted to invite her to our wedding. I must be going. - Merry Christmas. - To you too. Mew... Come on, we have shopping to do. Morn? - What's the matter? - I want to thank you a lot. - Did you watch it? - You were wonderful as usual. And you reminded me of our trip to the mountains. - And I grew my wings. - We'!! go there again, I promise. We've collected the whole amount for the surgery. - I'll see you in the hospital. - I love you. Bye. Bye. What are you talking about? Malgosia, get back to the hospital! Why are you laughing? Okay, wait. I'll be there right away. I don't want to take Kazik with me. What a shitty day. Karol left an hour ago. He's not answering his phone. Oh, I think he's back. I'll be there soon. - Mel. - Hi! - Were you a good girl? - You'll get No more money. Relax, darling. I have a job to do here. Perhaps you need help watching Kazik. For 2 years, you haven't given any sign of life. - It felt good. - You've thrown me away. - Why should I give you any signs? - Mel? I was a year and a half with you. You were like a big kid. I wanted to marry you! Now you mention that? Pop in in 2 years. All right... It didn't work for us, but Kazik needs a father. That's why I bought him a present from you last year. You owe me a hundred. And now go. - My little punk. - Kazik, do you remember him'? - See'? He recognized me. - Whatever. We need to see your aunt. - How about a playground? - Wait a moment. You go to his aunt and we'll go to the playground. - Mel, please. - I fed him, changed his diapers. - How often? - It doesn't matter. I never hurt him. Please, you know I work with kids. Kazik, do you want to go with him to the playground? Can I have your autograph? "SECOND LIFE" Matylda? Matylda! You grew up so much. You even talk. You used to sit up only. I missed talking to you. Now you're a big guy. And you recognized me. I wouldn't recognize you. Everybody will recognize a Santa Claus. I'm not a Santa Claus. I'm your dad. My dad is not a Santa. I mean he is and he is not. Get it? Come on, I'll show you something. Look. Now I'm a Santa, right'? - And now? - A Santa without a beard. You're kidding me. Have you seen such a Santa? No hat... no beard, no Santa jacket. Have you seen a Santa in boxers? - No. - Exactly. - This means I'm your dad. - What have you got for me? If I were a Santa, I would have brought you a gift, - because Santas always bring... - gifts. And I have nothing for you. Which means I am your dad! Last year you sent me a gift. - Isn't it too early for gifts? - They are still waiting. Open it. I've chosen it especially for you. Do you like it? - It's expensive. - Put it on, please. - It suits you. Beautiful. Today, when you meet my parents... You look very elegant. No, don't take it off. Excuse me, is that man... Never mind. Hi, Szczepan. What are you doing here? What am I doing? Drinking coffee. And you'? And you're drinking it here? All right, then. - Look... - Is it a new dress? No... - I remember it. - I borrowed it from Majka. Szczepan, could you go somewhere else? Could you? In 15 minutes I have a date here... And I won't feel quite comfortable, when you are here. It'll be awkward. You have a date here? - With who? - With a man. I'm just asking you nicely to drink your coffee in a different place. - Is it a problem? - No, it's not. Not at all. - I'm asking who is that date with? - Listen... pull yourself together. We've been divorced for 2 years. - I can meet whoever I want. - Of course. - Great. - Just tell me... who is that guy'? Do you want to know? He's younger than you. But ifs not an issue here. He at least tries to understand me. He's really cool. I care about him and wish I had met him earlier. Does it hurt'? Is it enough? - What does he look like? - I don't know. He lives in Mexico. I'll see him for the first time today. Anyway, he'll be the most beautiful guy for me. - Oh, It's starting. - Can I pay for the coffee? Hang yourself on the cash register. I didn't want to hurt you. Jesus Christ. - What can I get you? - Nothing. I'm waiting for someone. I want my dad to be happy on Christmas Eve. - What does your dad need to be happy? - He plays lottery and he the most he hit was four. High five! Excuse me, have you seen Matylda? A small sheep? No, I haven't. - Great, isn't it? Crappy crap. - Crappy crap. - Is Dad a Superman? - Yes, he is! -So, come on! Dad is a Superman! I love you, my son. I'm not your son. Yes, you are. Do you know what a Superman does? Have you been to a bookstore lately? On all the shelves there are books by one pretty lady. And 4 years ago your dad and that lady... It doesn't matter, anyway. I understand, that a kid wants to be proud of his father, but crappy crap, you are too young to understand certain things he accomplished... What do I have'? What do I have'? "Every word here I wrote thanks to you." Oh, shit! - Karol always hits the aim. - Who? - Mom's Karol. - So that's Karol, crappy crap. Have you ever seen Karol going down on the balconies from the 4th floor? And I had to do it many times. 1,2,3... and I'm on the ground. - Didn't you fall down? - Never! Do you want to see it? Do you want to see what a Superman can do? Stay here and wait. I can go higher! I'll climb an Eiffel Tower for you. A doggy! Killer, why are you barking? Who got on your nerves? Get inside, or you'll catch a cold. Come, my baby. Crappy crap. What are you staring at? The chimneys too narrow. Sing me a Christmas Carol. Kuba, turn it down! - Shhh... - Antos, I'm going to the neighbor's. You've sung it nicely. What would you like to get? - I need money. - Like everyone. Precisely, I need 200,000 and two tickets to the USA. Really? In the evening it'll be waiting under the Christmas tree. Could I borrow some money from you now? - I have 30 zlotys. - It's okay. Thanks. Great, kiddo. Give me five! Can you let me out? I wouldn't like to go down the way I came up. Kazik! Did I get up? Give me five. I got 30 zlotys. Are you hungry? Let's go. Kuba, Santa Claus was here. We'll get the cash. - What cash? - All we need. I borrowed him 30 zlotys, but he is going to bring 200,000 for the Christmas Eve. Great deal. He'll bring 2 tickets to the USA. Shoot, I could have asked for the 3rd one for Mom, - but I didn't want to push my luck. - Oh, kid, you're crazy. - Great, isn't it'? - Sure. Santa Claus was smoking, not me. Where are your cigarettes? Amos has made a deal. He wants to send me to the Boston Marathon. - What are you thinking? - One for Mom. One for Dad. What wrong have I done to you'? That's the way I was born. I WON'T BE HERE TOMORROW Who was that boy on the balcony? A cunning brat. He said he wanted 200 grand. Can you imagine? - He needed help? - You always talk about helping or saving people. You're obsessed or something. Eat or your strawberries will fall down. I don't want money. I want to be with my dad. At least on the Christmas Eve. Listen... - Dad loves you very much. - I know. He dreams about spending Christmas with you, but he can't because... He can't, because, crappy crap... because... He's saving the world. - Let's call it this way. - It's very important. If Dad didn't have to save the world, he would visit me, wouldn't he? Of course, he would visit you. Oh, my! Let's go back. Oh, shit! Honey'? How is it? Redo? Matylda! Matylda! Are you crazy? Taking a sheep to a Mall'? It's not my sheep. Then I'll take it away. - Leave it. - Is it yours? It's mine, I'm sorry. I didn't recognize it at the first moment. I thought it was a different one just passing by. A similar one. Matylda, where have you been? I thought Magda was kidding about the sheep. Let's take it home. It might speak with human voice. Look, it thinks you are... - Your jacket is made of wool. - What now? I don't know. I can look for Magda and give it back to her. Okay, have fun with that sheep and whoever you want. I'm going back home. Honey. It's Christmas Eve today. We're meeting my parents. Bye. Bye. So, where is your owner'? Why does a man give an empty vase to his beloved? It's broken, so we need to buy it back. - He could put 200 roses in it. - Will you help me? A man should present his beloved with a ring on the rooftop. Or make an ice sculpture like in "A Groundhog Day'. - Wouldn't you like that? - I would like... you to help me. And stop being such a know-all. Your dad did his best. He'll be sad. Wouldn't you like him to propose? Look, it's a beautiful vase. And here... these are toucans, I guess. If it turns out I was right, will I get a Wolfhund? - Are you kidding? - I'd like to have an Irish Wolfhund. Do you know how much such a big dog eats? No. Period. So why did Santa climb all the way up to make a promise? Your father is working hard on the Christmas Eve so that we don't starve, and you give 30 zlotys to a con artist. - All we need is a Wolfhound. - What if he comes? Sooner a cow shall talk with its butt. Go in. Excuse me, where can I find the manager'? Straight ahead. - It's talking with its butt. - Come on. I'm sorry. - Why is the snowman handcuffed? - How can I know? See? That's crazy. - Are you a boss here? - Yes. This morning your employee dressed up as Santa Claus - climbed up my balcony. - It's impossible. Really? It so happens, that I have found him in your company offer. He broke in to my son's room and he stole 30 zlotys. We've been on this market for years and we have a great, professional staff. So it's absolutely impossible... Of course, it's possible. Can you explain to me, why your employee handcuffed me'? It was him. I told you: that's crazy. It must be your ride. - There is no ticket. - Hello. You won't pay for the parking without it. And I won't let you out. Your woman has nearly destroyed the barrier and she ran, as if she saw a ghost. With no ticket. - Go on. - During the sales season I've seen people losing mind. But this I've seen for the first time in my life. Excuse me. Merry Christmas. In this case, you can leave with no ticket. Merry Christmas. Matylda, my precious. Where have you been? I spotted her buying a sweater. Don't you know, that little sheep shouldn't do shopping alone? Thanks. How did you catch her'? - I called her. - And she came up to you? I promised her I would take you both for ice-cream. What do you want'? I thought that we could... You have a girlfriend, so go to her. And leave me alone... piss off, not to use worse words... Got it'? Is it so funny'? I have enough of my problems. Thank you. I'm telling you, it is not a big sheep, but a little lamb... It's nearby. She won't make anything dirty. I'll keep her on my lap. I've already called all the taxi... companies. I am sorry too. I'm never going to use your services again. Merry Christmas. You don't have to believe me. That was the most beautiful weekend in my life. You better tell me how you proposed to Monika. What? We thought that as we live together anyway... It's nice. Magda, I love you. I love you. Tell me one word, and I will leave Monika. And if I won'! say anything? What happens then? You'll marry her? And at the wedding, little girls will throw rose petals, and the organist will sing the song that you wrote for me out of love? Get a grip, Redo. It's a piece of advice for the future. Will you give me a ride'? It'll be good here. I also have a boyfriend. He's handsome, intelligent and he runs a business, "Santa For Hire" and he's successful. And don't think that he's gay. Here's my prince. Bye! She got discharged. This morning. She got discharged. That's Karol! - How was it today? - I went sledging. - And what else? - I ate waffles. The waffles were with whipped cream and strawberries. And with little bubbles. They were black. Oh, my! I'm sorry. I'm dropping everything today. It's nothing. - Will you open the wine'? - Now? Don't you feel like wine? We always wait until the first star... Red wine should breathe a little bit. You're right. It's exquisite. Brunello di Montalcino. It's absolutely unique. Its secret is a careful choice of the plants and a proper nurturing. The rest is done by the water and the sun. Delicious. I love you. I'm so glad we're going to the mountains. Though you would prefer the seaside. I would prefer you... Well, this wine is unique. Next year you both can go to the seaside. Don't say that. Don't worry. I might be with you, too. I'll always be with you. Tosia? Tosia. - My child... - Mom, please. - Let's change the subject. - I'm begging you, Morn. That surgery gives me minimal chance. When I escaped the orphanage, I also had minimal chance. I thought that if I raised that money... - you'd see how much I care. - I'm very proud of you, honey. But I think that this subject is closed. Will you sing "Silent Night" for me'? Especially for me during the Christmas Eve dinner? You don't sing Christmas Carols at the wake. We'll get back to the question if carp is good for sushi. Your guest today is Karina Lisiecka, the author of a bestseller: "The Second Life". My heroine marries a very nice man. He's kind and protective. He loves her, never cheats on her, brings a Christmas tree and suddenly... One morning you realize that you have no dreams, no passions, you just have no life. There is a relationship, but the people are gone, they have nothing to offer to one another. Apart from a set of elegant glasses under a Christmas Tree. A husband who buys a vase... I mean glasses... is a by-plot. The main one is a story of great love. Two halves find each other in the world. - And they get back to life. - Wouldn't you like - to meet love online? - I'm not a character of this novel. And if you were? I would like to. Alas! So there's a chance for a sequel, but this time it will be a classic horror. Love wins all. That's how it is in life. Like in "Bridget Jones" - or in "Pretty Woman" - You're talking about life or movies? These movies are inspired by life. Hit the brakes! - Mel? - Doris! It's so good to see you. - Hi, have you checked the presents? - No, I haven't. - The vase is a pathetic present. - As every year. Remember the movie I didn't let you watch? If you say a word to Doris, I'll do to you what the good guy did to the bad guy. Have you seen Harry giving Sally a vase? - What Harry? - From "When Harry met Sally". Doris would like to get an engagement ring. At the top of the Empire State Building like in the "Sleepless in Seattle". - It's quite far away from here. - It's in New York. I work in graphics now. These posters are all over the city. - Have you read it? - No, but I have touched the subject. I'm starting my sledge with a turbocharger. You should hurry, we almost died today. And every woman wants to wear a wedding gown once before she dies. - A regular wedding gown: laces, a veil. - Why you almost died? - Could you lend me some money? - You haven't changed a bit. I'll give it back. We got into such a skid that it was a close shave - and we would end up like in "Misery". - In what? I have just changed. - Merry Christmas. - All the best. You didn't let me watch it. I have to go. It fell down. Here you go. Have a good day. Excuse me, we are looking for a vase. It's... - We have many vases here. - Exactly. I'll try and explain it. I don't want just a vase but a particular vase. - That's what we need. - Exactly. - Burgund. - Excuse me? This model is called Burgund. You're in luck. - How do you know it's this one'? - Don't you remember how we - put it together? - I've worked with china for 20 years and I have a lot of experience. Just a moment. And now'? It looks similar but... I'm not sure. I don't remember. How much is that? - 36,50. - Oh, no. It's not that one. - It's too cheap. - Intention is - what counts. - I can sell ii for more. No, I see now it's not that one for sure. So you're an expert and I'm not. So, here you go. - And now? - Look, it's identical. - I have told you. - Have you? Okay, I'll take it. And I'll pay for the broken one too. We'll take 2 just in case. I'll check if we have them. You know, Mom, that Dad saves the world? - He told you so'? - A man on the radio said so. Well, he doesn't know your dad. Dad is a bastard... - Don't say that. - Should I lie? He met him. Let him have his own opinion. When did I meet him'? You spent half a day with him. - When? - Today. You said you recognized him. - Hello, my darlings. - Hello. - Come in. - Let's go. How do you like the vase? A lot. Look. These are presents for a beloved one. Which one do you like? None. Let's go. Tell me. I might buy one for Wiktoria. Come. - You can't propose with a vase. - Yes, but... I don't want to propose. Well, I do, but... Never mind. - I've bought a ring already. - When? - A year ago. - So what are you waiting for'? For a special moment. Should I propose at the stadium during the finals, - or while parachuting? - I rented a tower. That's the way you do it. The more you give in love the more there is left for you. So I would like to give you everything: my life, my dreams, joy of looking at the stars and dreams that nothing will ever part us. Will you marry me'? The waitresses enter with the baskets full of rose petals - and they shower Kasia. - Rose petals? - Haven't you spoken to Kostek? - Women love it. Sure, but Doris? So perhaps a stadium would be better. It's beautiful. - How much is it? - 2300 zlotys. I had something more expensive on mind, but it is beautiful indeed. I'll think about it. Wiktoria is a lucky girl, but you'll have to save up some money. I'll manage. Thank you. It's not just a vase, but high quality Spanish porcelain. Hand made by the masters of Almassera, hand-painted with toucans, which Doris loves. It cost a fortune. I have to go and buy mistletoe hand-gathered by local masters. - Have a good one. - All the best. Merry Christmas, gentlemen. Finally. The garage door was stuck when I drove in. - I don't know. I parked outside. - Remind me, I'll report it. - You remembered. - Cheesecake and poppy-seed cake. You're wonderful. I've promised. He's a jerk, who has no heart. On the top of that has a girlfriend. - But you love him. - So what? No, nothing. It's ready. It should get you there. - Ostroleka is not the end of the world. - Isn't it? It's a pity. Smile. Come back soon. Thanks. Go and bring back jars with preserves. - You're a big preserve. Merry Christmas. - To you too. GO, go: Delicious! I'll tell my parents that you baked it yourself. - How about some wine'? - I'm driving. Are you going somewhere? You're right. You'll drive my parents home. Monika. - Wait, I'll cut it up. - What? No. Check on the borscht. My parents will be here soon. There is an occasion drink a shot so I wanted to take it. Robert, that London studio, you don't even realize who recorded there. Will April be okay for you? Where is the... You know, I've already arranged... I'm sorry, but I can't record in London. What is wrong with London'? - I came to say... - Dad... Robert will neither record in London... nor he will spend Christmas Eve with us. He won't spend anything with us. I don't understand. He decided to take up sheep breeding. Sheep? What sheep? I've already arranged for that studio. Recently I've seen somewhere a wedding American Style. - Mom. - In the open air. And there on grass among the guests... little sheep walked around. We have parted. I'm sorry. Holy shit. How will I call it off now'? You're an asshole! Merry Christmas. Great. I'll come as soon as I can. Maybe I'll bring your grandson... Bye, mom. How much is that? - Twenty. - How much? - I'll add a wafer as a bonus. - I just want that head. I'll give you a fiver. Seven zloty. I can give you the head for free. So that's the deal. I can add it to the wafer. - And how much is a wafer'? - Twenty. Here you go. Thanks. Thanks. Hello, my darlings. How did you spend the last hours before the birth of Jesus? Great. Kostek found a present for his sweetheart. I hope mine will be your dream present. And romantic too. Knowing your dad it will be something practical. You said intention is all that matters. I wanted it to be a real surprise. - Don't worry. It's really great. - You don't know what it is. That's right. How could I know. - Why are you standing here like that? - How? - Dad, can you help me'? - With what? - A letter to Wiktoria. - Write it yourself. I know what to write, but you know how to do it in a romantic way. Jesus. How do you call her'? - "My dearest sweetheart". - Let's write it down then. My dearest sweetheart. I would like to give you today and every day, until the end of the world... Great. So just sit here and write and I will be back in a moment. But where are you going? Hey! My dearest sweetheart. I would like to give you my love, my heart, sorrows, moments of reverie, and dreams about us living together. The more love you give the more there's left for you. I hope you're as happy as I am. I'like to get old with you. I love you more than my life. Blah blah blah. - You've written that? - Sure. I've consulted Misiek. He said that girls love such lines. It's good. I'll rewrite it nicely. Thanks, Dad. Karina! What is it? Are you a cabby now? I didn't order a cab. Listen. Damn. It was me. I can see that. You again. I'm not in the mood. You don't understand. It was me. - I got a date, and met you. - And I met you! Leave me alone! Sometimes people happen to bump into each other! You still don't understand! I was your date! What? What are you talking about? I was surprised myself. Listen! - Give it back. - No. - Give me my hat back. - I am Pedro 67. - I don'( believe you. - You'd better do. I live on a Mazunte beach in Mexico. I go fishing. My wife died , so I came to Warsaw - to meet you. - I don't believe this! Did you have fun'? - Fricking cabby! - I didn't know it was you. Stop it! I didn't know it was you! - Why did you write to me?! - I don'! know! I just did it! - Maybe we're meant for each other'? - My ass we are! Stop that! - I want my hat, please! - Don't you get it? - My hat! = Don't you get it?! Maybe ifs a sign?! Maybe we're in love again?! Think about it! Stop breaking that! Maybe we got a second chance? - Leave the lady alone! - Back off! - Stop! Stop abusing me! - Calm down! Stop stalking me! Maybe we should give it a try! I didn't know it was you! I don't believe a single word you say! You're nuts. You're hopeless, and self-centered! You've got shit between your ears! And this hat you got from me, Kathrine 29! Get away from my car! You may shove it up your ass! Screw you! I may be your witness. Leave me alone. - Hello, in-law. - Don't call me that. Merry Christmas. I didn't want to upset you... but Dad got himself... I hoped he'd change his mind, but he's going to bring her to Christmas Eve dinner. My child, your father is a cheat! And a moron! Yes, but you also wanted to bring... No, dear. I didn't want anything. Nice shoes. I've always wanted to get them. Thanks. We'll buy you a pair then. These ones are for her. She's a jogger. So we've been told. She brags she does 10 kilometers in 53 minutes. Dad believes her. He's a fool for that snot. A snot? Do you know her? So why are you saying that? Maybe she's a fine and intelligent lady. Mature. Doesn't matter. Not 53... but 52. She does 10 kilometers... in 52 minutes. - How old did Dad say she was'? - 29. - Is that what he said? - I'm so sorry... Excuse me! What? - I... I... - You what? I read it twice. It made me believe I can change my life. You know what? You can change shit. You can change your hairstyle. But you wrote it here. Seems so. So you don't believe life can be changed? Like in your novel... Don't you? Do I? Excuse me. I've got to run. Merry Christmas! "SECOND LIFE" KARINA LISIECKA Good evening. Why are you walking alone? It's not safe around here. Do your parents know? Screw it! Excuse me! Merry Christmas. Could you give me a push? I know she won't change her mind. Neither will you. I don't want to be away from you this Christmas Eve. Do what it takes. You may scream, swear, I don't know... demolish the house, throw things around. I just don't want us to be apart this Christmas Eve. Fuc... I'm sorry. I said I was sorry. I shouldn't have said that! I'm looking for Magda, a girl with a sheep. She's not here. - Have you heard from Mel? - He doesn't pick up the phone. Merry Christmas. Can I help you? - Do I look like I need help? - Yes, actually you do. Really? - What's up'? - Nothing. - How long have you been together'? - Why do you want to know? I'm talking to him. 7 years. - You're lying. - No. - Who is it'? - 7 years? Does it surprise you'? I'm such a moron! SANTAS FOR HIRE You are together! Shall I spell it for you'? No, that's great! You're together! - Shall I run him over'? - Definitely. Swell! You're a couple, guys! What happened with the boy'? Did a vile dragon snatch him? - It was a dog. - A dog snatched a boy? A dog ripped his pants. And the boy has a problem. He's still 200 grand short. Where does he get those stories from'? I left him with Mel just for a few hours. He's a great storyteller. Karol! Are you ill'? - Yes, I am. - Are you going to die'? It's a pity. You don't look sad though. - How arrogant! After all that... - Maybe we should...? - Are you justifying him? - No, but he's the father after all. Is that a good enough reason to ruin Malgorzata's Christmas Eve? It's someone to see Karol. Fear not! I wanted to... We're even. No need to apologize. Get lost. Betty doesn't want to see you. Please... Give it to Kazik. What shall I tell him? That his father... Don't tell him it's from his father. Tell him it's from Santa Claus. Kazik knows you're his father. No, he doesn't. Yes, he does. I told him. Karol! Let me have the Christmas Eve dinner. Stay cool! Thanks! - You're leaving. - As you can see. - To Mexico? - Yes, I never changed my plans. To the Mazunte beach. That's the boat, right? Yes. I bought it on the internet 2 months ago. - Not bad. So it's true. - What's true'? - That you sold your apartment. - You knew that. And that robe. It's red. - You have a problem with that? - No, I love red. My ex hated it. Your ex isn't here. I know. He's probably sitting somewhere upset that nothings the old way. Every time he wanted to change our life, - he tried to keep things the old way. - I never liked your ex. A real bore. - No sense of humor. - My wife was a bore too. She had sex with Santa Claus. I still loved her. She's dead. Gone. Why did you do that? Allow me! Does it hurt'? Loosen it up! If she was alive, I wouldn't have met you. Let us stay, in case Santa comes. You've seen what kind of Santa it is. Let him stay alone then. I'm too tired to argue. Get dressed. Shall I help you get up? I'm tired of this. Get dressed in no time... Fund's in the fridge. Amos, come. If you change your mind... - Mom. - Yes? - Get Antos that Wolfhund. - We have no money. Get him one, when you do. Don't worry. Why should I'? I'm just saying. Off you go, kid. All the best to you. Merry Christmas, Son. Let all your dreams come true. And Mel - I wish you not to screw it up, as you usually do. Happy Birthday! - To whom? - To Kazik!!! Awesome racing sledge. And whose idea was it? Szczepan is here. - This is for Kuba's surgery in America. - Thanks, Dad. And this is for the Wolfhund. It'll take a while. This is for you too, Kazik. Look what else you got. A huge teddy, a toy car... Mom... If Kuba dies, could we afford a Wolfhund then? May I? Merry Christmas. Pull over! I'm sorry. It's all my fault. Quiet. Don't cry. Let's see what you've got for me. What a beautiful vase! I'd never guess. Spanish porcelain. Hand-painted... chickens. Such an expensive gift, and all I got you is a ball. You're so sweet. There's a letter... - What? - I love you too. Excuse me. Come here, kid. - What's that vase about? - It's hopeless. - Where's mine? - I knew it'd work. - What'? - The letter. Do you want to get smacked'? We aren't going back. I won't fall asleep without the Superman. We'll pick it up tomorrow. - The boy! Pull over! Stop! - What boy? Kazik! Get back here! Skim! - Dad! Dad's in there! - What are you doing? - Dad's in there! - Get back in the car now! Kuba, my God. Are you okay, Kuba? Dad! Get a cab. - You were damn lucky. - It is my dad. He's a Superman. Seems so. I love you. What are you doing? I've got something else for you. I got that round thing... - Did you touch anything here, Kostek? - To the side. There's such a moment in a man's life, and a woman's too, but usually in a man's one... Anyways . . . I don't know if you'll like it, if it's in your taste... I can't believe this. Me neither. It's just like the one I fell in love with. It means you understand each other without words. You're made for each other. Will you say yes, Doris? - Or else I'll perform a ritual... - Yes. - Killing on one... - Kneel and spit it out at last. Will you marry me'? Yes! - My daughter. - Open it. Thank you! A sailor's cape. You said sailing was awesome, so we thought... we'd gel you this beauty. Baby? How could you, Justyna? What have I done'? What's wrong, girl? Tell us! Luck up. Can you see it? The small one's for you. It was supposed to be bigger, but bigger ones were sold out. Do you like it? What about 'till death do us part?' And in a toffee cream. Stop, Dad. Once again. Dad! Hi, Son. - In a children hospital in Bielany. - We'll stop off to say goodbye. I got it, bye. I'll need to change your name in my phone. - What do you have there now? - Dork. Did Santa screw you too'? What's wrong with your brother'? It's a long story. Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - Thanks. We lost all hope. And then all these good things happened to us. And now the money from Tosia. I would've forgotten. I got back there that night to return the 30 zlotys. Thank you. I still have no idea how come you ended up on that balcony. A miracle. A Christmas Eve miracle. Good. I love you!
