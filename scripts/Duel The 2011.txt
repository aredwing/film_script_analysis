You gotta do better! No! No! No! Finally awake, sleepyhead? How long was I sleeping? Not long. But I'm glad you're awake. I didn't want you to miss it. Miss what? Our grand entrance. This is it. It's small. Cozy. I guess this is the kitchen. I'm gonna look around, okay, Mom? Jeez. Have you found the bedroom? Yeah, you could say that. I'm sorry, Vance. I just... I... This is all I could find. I just wanted to leave. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. I almost forgot. I... This came for you. Tomorrow you start a new life in a brand-new school. Aren't you excited? Thanks, Mom. You wanna take it? There you go. Reach for it. There you go. There it goes. Come on, geek. Don't you need your book for class? - Yes. - Then take it. What's stopping you? - Please! - Hey, if you're so desperate for books, you can have mine. Who the hell are you? Another geek, I guess. Come on. Take it. What's the matter, man? If you want it, just take it. Man, I will knock you out. No, you won't. The bell just rang. Get to class now. Consider yourself lucky, punk. All right. Settle down. Settle down, class. Hey. I understand we have a new student to our school. Mr. Vance Holden? Halden? Vance Halden? Is that right? Would you come and introduce yourself, tell the class where you're from, et cetera? Hey. My name is Vance. I'm from Wisconsin. Um, I... Mr. Halden? I just moved here yesterday. That's it, I guess. That's good. Welcome, Mr. Halden. Does anyone have any questions for Vance? No. Okay. You can take your seat, sir. Thanks. How did you get your black eye? It's personal. All right, class. Settle down, okay? We're gonna let Mr. Halden get settled, and then we're going to open our books to Chapter 25, specifically page 193. No worries. I told you, it's never gonna happen. We're just too different. You'll never do better than me. Maybe. But maybe I'd rather be alone. You're making the biggest mistake of your life. Please, Maurice, just let me go. Got a complaint, boy? You got something to say? What about you? Huh? - Is that you, Vance? - Yeah. - How was school? - It was fine. I have some great news. I got a job at a restaurant close to here. Great. Are you okay? Yes, Mom. So as you can see, the Pythagorean theorem allows us to find any unknown side of an isosceles triangle, which we'll designate X. This triangle is also known as a 45-45-90 triangle, named so because of the measure of their angles. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the measure of the hypotenuse is equal to the measure of a leg multiplied by the square root of two. So to find X... Quiet down, and listen up, kiddies. The theme... for this quarter semester is basketball. Invented by some Canadian out in Massachusetts as a way to keep his little bratty kids busy. And it's been keeping brats busy ever since. What's this? We got a newbie? Yes, sir. What's your name, newbie? Vance. Play ball, Vance? Hard of hearing or slow to speaking? Which is it? Yeah, a little. I play a little. Show me. Six shots in a row will get you a B. Five gets you a C. Anything less, and you fail. Anything more than six... ...probably ain't possible for you. Waiting on a written invite, newbie? Show us what you got. Now we're moving. One. Two. Yo, this white boy can shoot. Six. Seven. Hey, if I make another, do I get an A plus? Time for laps. Twice around the gym. Move it! Move it! What? I guess no one accidentally bumps into each other where you're from. I didn't know you bumped into me. I mean, I know that somebody bumped into me. I just... I didn't know... I didn't know you bumped into me. I don't think I'm making any sense. It's okay. I don't think anyone makes sense around here, especially me. My name's Lena. I'm Vance. But you already know that, don't you? The whole school knows that. We don't get a lot of new kids. Lucky me. I saw what you did for Amy. That was really brave. I saw you, too. You're a pretty good dancer, by the way. Oh, so you were the creepy stalker staring at me through the window. Yeah, I guess I was. You like what you saw? Yeah. Good. So, are you doing anything after school? Maybe we could go eat something. I can't. I have work. I teach a swim class at the pool. You swim, too? I am a girl of many talents. Oh, and I'll try to be more careful next time. It's amazing how a girl can shoot you down with that smile. Who says I got shot down? Well, she's walking that way, - and you're standing still. - Good point. You know, you caught fire back there in the gym, crony. Where'd you learn to shoot like that? - My dad taught me. - Really? Who was your dad, Larry Bird? Not exactly. The name's Jules. This my school. - Name's Vance. - Really? 'Cause the way I hear people talking about you around here, I could've sworn your name was New White Boy. Hey, don't even sweat that, all right? Most people around here are ignorant and dumb. That's why they never make it anywhere. - What, and you're different? - I'm not just different, I'm better. Well, I gotta say you are the first person that's taken the time to talk to me. - I told you I was different. - Yeah, which makes me wonder, what do you want? Definitely not ignorant and dumb. You're right. I do want something from you. But why tell you when I can show you? Come on. Come on, little white boy. What you got to lose? Excuse me. Where are we going? Are all white folks this impatient? I am. That's a shame. Man, how do I know you're not taking me someplace dangerous? So you're impatient and paranoid? How much longer, man? Crony, trust me when I tell you, this is worth the wait, all right? - All right, bro. - Come on, man. - Yeah! - What's this? This is the finest in underground basketball. It's a tournament. A duel, to be exact. What's a duel? It's a two-and-two game played for money. The amount changes each time. Game! How much you eager to lose, boy? Then the stakes are set. Come at me with that nonsense. Real men don't play for less than 100. - Okay. - Bet. What's the game play to? First one to 21 wins. You see, there's just one more thing. Calling fouls only slows things down. That's why each team only gets to call one foul, and only one per game. Oh, I know that guy. Sucker. Yeah, that's Maurice. He never loses. And legend has it that he's never called a foul, no matter how hard he's hit, ever. Trust me, you don't wanna know that guy. Come on. Why'd you show me that? I just wanted to give you a taste. All in due time, new white boy. Yo, what up, J-Bow? I got it right now... guns, drugs, chicks, whatever. - Just let me know, all right? - I'm good. Yeah. I'll see you later, though. - Easy. - For sure. Yeah, yeah. - Yo, where we going? - Probably the only place crazier than a duel tournament... my house. Mama! Mama, I'm home! Juli! Juli! Juli! What it is, Ang. Happy to see me? - I want a piggyback ride. - Machine's out of order. Go color something, you little brat. That's my little sister Angelica. My mom's got this thing with Spanish names. My real name is Julio, and Angelica, and then she named my little brother Rodrigo, but everybody calls him Rody. No-Iook pass! He takes it in the air! Slam dunks! Rody, what did I tell you about using my basketball? You weren't using it. That don't mean you can, little man. But I don't got a ball. You want a ball? Go steal one. But leave mine alone. I'm gonna have 100 balls when I'm famous. I'm gonna be better than Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade, and Michael Jordan combined. And I'm gonna record myself making all the best plays. Whatever. Keep dreaming, you little shrimp. Mama! Mama! Mama! Quit all your shouting, Julio. This place is the size of a matchbox. I can hear you just fine. This is my friend Vance. You a good boy, Vance? Yeah. I think so. Well, that's good, 'cause Julio sure can use more good people around him. What you talking about, Mama? Don't get no better than me. - Can he stay for dinner? - Sure. If it's one thing I do right, it's feeding young men. - All right. Thanks, Mom. - Mm-hmm. - See you. - All right. Mama, this is so good. You better watch it. He's gonna take it one day. You're gonna wake up... Eat your food. Your big brother? We just met. We got the girls. Hey, Jules, can I use your basketball when you're gone? You already know the answer to that. Now get that camera out of my face. Aw, man. Come on, Ang. Let's go. Hey, yo, man, I gotta roll. All right. Cool. Let me holler at you for a second. You stuffed? Yeah, man. Thanks for dinner. I really appreciate it. - I do what I can. - But, yo, why do I get the feeling you're just buttering me up for something? Definitely not ignorant and dumb. - Mm-hmm. - You're right. I do want you for something, crony. I want you to be my dueling partner. I know you can play, and I think together we stand a good chance at winning the Gathering. What's the Gathering? It's the largest dueling tournament in the Northeast. for a grand prize of 50 G's. Man, what do you need $50,000 for? Look around, new white boy. Just where do you think we are? It's the ghetto, partner. And that grand prize is my family's one-way ticket to a better life. Yo, I'm sorry, man. I don't play anymore. I thought you might say that. And that's why I came up with a way to make it worth your while. What's that? You help me win the Gathering, and I'll make it so that no one messes with you at school. You can do that? Like this. By this time tomorrow, you'll go from "pasty new white boy" to "Vance, the number one playa." It's got a nice ring to it, doesn't it? Come on. What do you say? We got a deal? Deal. Ah, yes! All right. Look. First duel's tomorrow, right before school, a block away from the cage. - All right. - Don't keep me waiting. All right, man. Thanks again. Cool. See you later, all right? Yes! I'm gonna win that Gathering. Where the hell's this white boy? Man, and you said I was impatient. I'm ready. What? Are you serious with that outfit? This is my old school uniform. What school did you go to, Goof Troupe Academy? This is a basketball uniform. It's designed to help you move better on the court. Yeah, well, at the same time, make you look like a complete dork. - Whatever. - Look, man, if I'm gonna teach you how to have a swagger, you're gonna have to learn that style matters, man. Game! But for now, we got some business to tend to. Come on. Well, well. If it ain't the Negro Doublemint Twins. Ha! Very funny, Jules. - Almost as funny as... - Your man's get-up over here. This is Anton and Parker. They got this strange bromance thing where they finish each other's sentences. So this your new partner, huh, Jules? - Some... - Raggedy white kid? Well, this raggedy white kid can probably play better than both of y'all combined. - Can you put your money... - Where your mouth is? - How much? - 60. Come on. We don't play for chump change, Milli Vanilli. All right. Throw in those sneakers you're wearing, and you got yourself a game. - Bet. - All right. Remember the rules. Game's 21, and you only get one foul total. - I got it. - All right? Take off that funky jersey, and pull down them dumb shorts. Let's go. Check up. This ain't the theater, son. Stop being so dramatic. Get up! Get up! Vance! Are you cool? Yeah. I think I understand this game now. That's good to know. You trying to use our foul on this one? No. Save it for a real one. Goddamn! The white boy's gone crazy. Get there! Yeah! Pay up, Mary-Kate and Ashley. No checks, no credit. Let's go. Uh-huh. - Mm-hmm. - This isn't over. All right. Thanks for the business. Please come again. Please come again. - Know what this is, son? - A smelly pair of sneakers? No, this is one step closer to the Gathering, son. One step closer. Come on. We gonna be late to school. I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to. It's okay. It's okay. Yo, yo. I got word of a duel tomorrow. I think we can pick up a few bills. Something's weird. Ain't nothing weird about money, crony. No, no. I mean, like, here in school. Something seems... I don't know... different, man. People seem afraid of me. What else do you expect when you almost killed a man for taking one of your cigarettes? Wait. What? I didn't do that. I don't even smoke. Of course you do, son. You picked it up in juvie while you were doing time for stealing cars. No, no, no. I don't even know how to drive, man. That's not what they say. They say back home, you joyrided a car right off the Grand Canyon. What? Wait a second, man. You're saying this stuff. It was you? How else you want me to make you look hard? You want me to tell people you raised corn and milked cow titties? I didn't even live near the Grand Canyon. It's not even in the same state. Details, partner. Details. This is retarded. There is no way this is gonna work, man. People aren't just gonna believe everything they hear? Excuse me. Are you the guy that broke into Madonna's mansion? Uh, I... Call me. Told you so. Yo, what's with this note, by the way? You'll see. Hey, don't keep me waiting. I must be the luckiest man in NYC if I get to walk these streets with you. Well, that'd be sweet, Jules, if you hadn't told the same thing to Amorette last week. Wait. Who told you that? - She did. - I didn't know the two of you spoke. Well, I talk to a lot of girls in that school, and they all tell me how big of a player you are. But you know you can't believe everything you hear in school. Oh, well, I can if it's true. And you know what? I don't have the time or patience to deal with a boy who can't make up his mind. Hold on. Let me clear this up. Okay. I'm listening. All right. 'Cause you know you're one hot little mama. - Oh. - And I ain't too shabby myself. And I think we breaking all kinds of laws if we ain't together. You know, that's sweet, Jules. But Rachel... she thought so, too, when you told her the exact same thing. Nice try. She knows Rachel, too. Where is this kid? Yo, I thought you told me not to be late. Exactly. I told you not to be late. What are we doing here? Practice. Are you serious? We got lucky last game. But luck runs out. Only skill is infinite, partner. What you saying, I got no skill? You know how to play the game your way. But dueling is a whole nother world. And that's what I'm here to teach you. Game! Let's see what you got. Harder. Let's go. Harder! Look, there are no rules here, which means... - Anything goes. - I see. You need to forget the rules you've learned, all the habits, and play the game raw. 'Cause the other team... they ain't gonna hold back. Feel me? Ready? Watch this. Come on. Come on. No? I can take that. I can take that. You're too slow. Come on! Play ball, man! Let's go! Check! Let's go, man. We gotta get tough. Let's go, man. You ready? That's what's up. Ready? You ready? Check the ball up! Go get the ball. Come on, man. Put your body into it. Let's go. I think I feel you now. That's good. That's good. - Check it up. - Yeah. That's good. Let's go. Come on. Yeah. Let's go. Come on, man. Let's go. Give me that. Not bad. - Thanks. - So, what are we doing here? I don't do the cafeteria. It's too crowded, plus I don't like eating alone. And playing basketball by yourself is much better? You got a point. Let me rephrase that. Why am I here? Remember the first day? You asked me about my eye. I felt like I came across a little rude, and I wanted to apologize. And you want to do that here, in the gym? Here's as good a place as any. So rumor around school is that you're the cool, tough, bad-boy type. Is that true? I don't know. Maybe the cool part. And why did you move to New York? That's complicated. What isn't? Seriously, why did you invite me here? I wanna make a bet with you. A bet? I make a shot, you go out on a date with me. If I miss, you can have whatever you want. Is this what passes as flirting where you're from? What have you got to lose? Okay. But I pick the shot. Deal. What's the shot? Right where you are. Really? Turn around. You gotta be kidding me. The basket's not even down. Rules are rules, hotshot. Are you backing out on your deal? Just watch me. Looks like you didn't want that date badly enough. Trust me, that's not it at all. Lunch is over. I'll think about what I want my prize to be. I'll try not to make it too painful. I can't wait. Vance, are you home? Hi, Mom. Are you okay? Yeah. I haven't seen you in a while, and I just wanna make sure everything's okay. Everything's cool, Ma. Good. That's good. I want everything to be good. Yo. Yo, yo. Get dressed. Can I go? Another duel already, man? You gotta be kidding me. No. This is a different kind of duel, son. It's Friday, man. We gotta go kick it with some chicks. The game don't stop off the court. Man, I'm too damn tired to go out. Boy, does it sound like I'm asking you? Not really. You wanna fit in? To get you some cool points? 'Cause they're calling you a hillbilly. Man, right now, all I want is sleep. Look, the one rule of fitting in, son... you gonna shine, you gotta be seen to be noticed. - I'll pick you up in 20. - Fine. - Can I go? - No, Rody. Come on. Fix yourself. Man, so what's, like, a New York party like? Man, so what's, like, a New York party like? Oh, New York parties... This party we're about to go to is crazy. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. Okay. But, yo, what's the deal with you and that girl Maria, Lena's friend? Oh, Maria? That's just my Monday-Friday. Stop it, man. Come on. I'm telling you. Why you think they call me Jules? - I got them. - All right, man. You better prove it at this party then. Watch what you about to run into. - My man. - My man. - Dawg. - Big-O. What's up, boy? Mm-hmm. Why so amazed, new white boy? Ain't no chicks back home in Wisconsin? - Not like this, man. - Come on. Let's get some drinks. Hey, yo, my man. Hook us up with two of something strong. - All right? - What, like a rock? No. But I can think of something that rhymes with that, though. Oh, in your dreams, Jules. Hey, yo, Jules, I think it's Saturday by now. No, it's still 11:55, homey. Hey. Hey, yourself. I did not expect to see you here. Me, neither. I'm surprised you're not back at juvie for stealing a cop car and crashing into city hall. You know you can't believe everything you hear, right? So you're not the bad boy everyone says you are? No. I'm badder. Come on. You wanna dance? Maybe. You on the wrong block, boy. Ain't no one invite you! Don't be like this, Maurice. You don't belong, boy. - Says who? - Says me! - That's who! - Stop it! You have to stop being like this, Maurice. I'm not gonna be with you, ever, and you can't keep scaring guys away. - Who says I'm scared? - You should be. Stop it, I'm serious. You scared yet, boy? Not even close. Maurice, you better back up off my part... - Hey, yo, don't touch me, son. - Back up then. - This don't involve you. - What you trying to do, Dre? Whatever you wanna do. Whatever, Jules. You know where we from. This isn't funny anymore, Maurice. Okay. Okay. - Why don't we settle this like men? - What you got in mind? Duel! Me and my boy versus you and that clown-ass sidekick of yours! - Court across the street. - Don't be stupid, Maurice. I'm not some property to be won. You're on! Then let's go. And bring Julesy. - Come on, Jules. - No, man. We're not ready yet. I hear you and your boy been winning a few duels, trying to make it to the Gathering. I bet you think you good. But you ain't nothing, you hear? Let's make this official! Game! Stakes? - You name them. - Oh, really? How much you and your boyfriend need to enter the Gathering? Then there it is. One game... 300. - Man, you crazy? - Are you scared? Game accepted! You are crazy. Why you still running? Where they going? Show me something, white boy. Let's go, boy! Keep going, man! Stop touching me. Stop touching me, man. Come on! Come on! That's game! Know your place, boy... on the ground, in pain. And stay away from my girl! Stay! Hey, what's up, man? Yo, I heard you went balls to walls with the man last night. Tough loss. Well, I got mad respect. Thanks. Check it. You think you could steal me a whip? Excuse me. Lena, stop. Give me a minute. Just let me explain. Explain what, Vance? How you think I'm some prize you can win? How I'm some trophy you and Maurice can compete for? - It's not like that. - Yes, it is. And don't try to tell me different. You're just like Maurice. You treat people like objects, and I'm through with that. - That's not it at all. - Get out of my way, Vance. I can prove it to you. That's just it. You always think you need to prove something. Maybe because you're new here. But all you're proving is how insecure you really are. Lena, I'm sorry. Oh, snap, son. That's 0 for 2. Okay, everyone, settle down. We're gonna pick up where we left off last week. Where was that again? What are you doing here? Turns out you had an open spot in the class, so here I am. This isn't an adult's class, Vance. Who says I'm an adult? Well, if you're a kid, you're gonna need a guardian. Will you be my guardian? Whatever. Okay, everyone. Let's get started. Hey. Hey, girly, what are you doing here? Just waiting. My class is after this one. - That's cool. - By the way, I never thanked you for helping me. You know, at school? I wish there was something I could do for you. You know what? Maybe there is. Come here. Somebody help him! Lena, he's drowning! Help him! He's drowning! Somebody save him! Get him out of the water! Lena, he's drowning! Help! Help him! Maybe swimming isn't so bad after all. You jerk! Thanks. Lena, what's wrong? Come on. I was just kidding. So that was interesting. I think you might wanna stick with basketball. Yeah, definitely. Do you have to go home right now? Why? What do you have in mind, Mr. Swimmer? I don't know. I don't know the city that well, and I was hoping that maybe you could show me around. So now I'm your tour guide. No, never mind. I didn't mean it like that. It was a stupid idea. I know just the place. Yeah? Let's go. So, what do you think? I mean, when most people say they wanna see New York, they usually mean, like, the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building or something. Well, who wants to be like most people? I know I don't. I love it. How'd you find this place? My dad used to bring me here when I was little. He always told me that all my dreams could come true. He said it was as simple as dropping a coin in the fountain and wishing hard enough. - What'd you wish for? - You know you can't say. You know, you were right, Lena, the other day when you told me that you weren't some trophy to be won. Oh, yeah? So what am I then? I don't know if I've figured that out yet, but I want to. And what about you, huh? What are you, Mr. Vance Halden? What do you mean? Are you some master car thief straight out of juvie, or are you some basketball prodigy that can play with his eyes closed? I'm neither. So what are you then? I... I'm my father's Frankenstein monster, his phony creation. Your father? Yeah. He's a real basketball player. Or at least he wanted to be. He never made it. I guess he thought his son was his last chance to... I don't know... taste some kind of glory or something. So he pushed me and trained me and tried his hardest to turn me into the player that he never was. So what happened? I failed. It was the Northbelt tournament, and my high school was down one with under a minute to go. The ball was passed to me... it always was... and, I... I don't understand this. I mean, that is a shot that you have made thousands of times. A shot you can make with your eyes shut. You cannot lose! Ever! The next day, my mom packed us up, and we moved to New York. Haven't seen him since. I'm so sorry. You don't have to be anyone's creation. You can live your own dreams. Then maybe I should make some. Come on. Wow. Watch this. Wanna know what I wished for? You're not supposed to say. Who said anything about saying anything? I can't do this. Why? I can't get involved with a dueler. I don't want anything to do with that stupid, violent game. No. You said I don't have to be anyone's creation. You said I could choose what I want. I want you. More than a duel, more than anything. I think I know what I want my prize to be. Shoot. I want you to promise me that you're never gonna hurt me. I won't. Ever. Yo, Jules. Jules, Jules, wait up. I was looking all over for you yesterday, man. - You weren't at school. - Yeah. And what's it to you? Look, man, I know you're mad at me for losing the $300. Mad? Mad? I get mad when I lose $20. - When it's 300, I get pissed! - I'm sorry, man. I'll figure out a way to get it back. Man, there's a tournament today. It's a start. I can't. Crony, you're just trying to push all my buttons, ain't you? What is it? Another hot date? No, man. I can't play. What do you mean, you can't play? I promised Lena I'd give it up. Oh, come on, man. You gotta be kidding me, man. - I'm sorry. - Are you? Are you, new white boy? - You sorry for selling me out? - I didn't mean to! But you did, though, 'cause this is all just a game to you, right? Just a way to have fun during your short stay in my hood. It's not like that! But this ain't a game to me, crony! This is real life. This is what keeps a brother from selling dope on the streets and robbing QuikStops for money. - Listen, Jules, I just... - Don't touch me, all right? If you're gonna betray me, don't do it with kindness. Be a man about it. I'm sorry, man. You're a liar, crony, and I ain't gonna forget this. What's up? Come on, man! I didn't lose! Now can I have it? Get out! Look, get outta here! Stay out of my room, Rody! Come on! What are we doing here? What's the matter? Don't you trust me? You know I do. It's just that it's late, and I'm pretty sure that this right here is illegal. Shh. Security will hear us. Wait a second. This is risky. Is there anyone there? No, but... Yo, I didn't even bring a bathing suit. Who says you need one? Come on. You're so dead. Jules, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be at school. - Thinking. - Thinking? That's what you're supposed to be doing at school. You wanna tell me about it, baby? I let you down, Mama. You've never let me down one day in your life. You've made me nothing but proud. I wanted to get you outta here, to protect you. I thought I was the one supposed to be doing the protecting around here. I just wanted to get you to a better place. Someplace nicer. The only place I care about being is with my children. I can't think of anyplace nicer. Now get to school. All right. I'm gonna go get my bag. The end of another wasted day of un-education. Are we still meeting tonight? Our spot? I don't know. Are you going to make it worth my while? Don't I always? I just need to pass by the pool to pick up my class schedule for next week. But I'll meet you there, okay? It's more than okay. Can't have your dessert before dinner. Well, well. Look at Mr. Happy-go-lucky go. - Jules... - You know, there was a time when you couldn't take three steps in school without someone shoving you up against a locker. Yo, come on, man. Don't be like that. It's been a while. How you been? What do you care? I care, Jules. Just 'cause I stopped dueling doesn't mean I don't care, man. - Whatever. - What am I supposed to do? - Prove it. - How? There's a duel at the court where we played the twins. Two preppy-ass rich kids think they got game and don't mind blowing their daddy's wallet trying to prove it. Look, man, I wanna help, but... You owe me. If we win this tournament, I can get all the dough I need to join the Gathering and then some. I... Okay. All right, Jules. - Man, where are they? - They'll be here. Are you sure this is the right court? Look, take a chill pill, man. They'll be here. When, man? I'm supposed to be somewhere. I'd say right about now. - Damn. - Look at that. Look at all this money. Yeah. He think he nice, don't he? Right? - What up, playas? - Oh, hey, I don't think that's a parking spot there, crone. - Whatever. They can tow me. - This your partner? He damn sure ain't my girlfriend, if that's what you're thinking. Chill, bro. We just came to play. Wrong. You just came to lose. Whatever. Yeah. Game, preppies. How much? Wallet game. What the hell's a wallet game? Winning team takes everything that's in the losing team's wallet. That's more money than you've ever seen in your life. - So? - It's too much. I get it. - Somebody's afraid of losing. - Not to you. So check it up then. Damn! That white boy kinda nice! I know you ain't trying to hustle me, man. Come on. Let's go. Right now, man. And that's the game. - He cheated. - Hey, don't even go there. - It ain't our fault y'all can't play no ball. - Yo, I gotta go. Another game. Double or nothing. Ain't gonna happen, fool. - Now surrender your wallets. - This is BS. - How you gonna take me out tonight? - Shut the hell up. Jules, I'm sorry, man. I gotta go. - Hey, but we just... - Your friend late for a drug deal? Hey, why don't you take your own advice and shut up? Lena! Lena, wait up! I need to talk to you. - She doesn't wanna talk, Vance, okay? - But... - She needs her space, okay? - Marie, just let me... Just leave her alone. First, you treat her like property, and then you leave her stranded? You better check yourself. And I swear to God, if you do it again, I'm coming after you. Hey. Can we talk now? This isn't the first time I've been stood up, Vance. I know the routine, and I'm sick of it. - I didn't mean to hurt you. - That doesn't make it hurt less. What will? Maybe nothing. Man, throw it back. - You can catch, right? - Yeah. Aw, sh... That's the last time, Lena. I swear you'll never be stood up again. Until the next time. Vance, I've heard this all before. I mean it. I'm sorry, but I don't believe you. Yo, little man, over here! That ain't for staring, boy! - Give it back! - Yeah! Yo, get over here! Lena, don't do this. You broke your promise, Vance. You said you weren't going to hurt me. It was a mistake. Come back here, kid! Yo, we gotta go. We gotta go. Come on. Please... Please just leave me alone. That's right. I got a good handshake, too. You know how to do that. Spell "Mississippi." M- l-S-S-l-S-S-l-P-P-I. Mom! Mom! What happened? Mom? Hello? Oh, God! Mama. Mama. Why? It's gonna be all right. Yeah, it's gonna be all right. I need to see a patient. Rodrigo Brent. I'm sorry, sir. You'll have to wait like everyone else. I need to see him now. Won't do no good, crony. Jules. Yo, I heard the news. I'm so sorry. They won't let us in. He's in surgery. Cops said he was being chased. Chased? They saw it on Rody's camera. It was Maurice and a bunch of others. He won't get away with this, Jules. What the cops gonna do, huh? To them, Maurice is just another thug on these streets, and Rody... He's just another little black kid. Man, if there's anything I can do, just let me know. Pray. Mrs. Brent? Tell me he's okay, Doctor. His leg is broken in three places, but that's the least of our concerns. There's swelling of the brain from the concussion he sustained. Oh, Lord! We operated to relieve the pressure, but as is common in this type of operation, Rodrigo is in a coma. How long? There's no real way of knowing. Days, weeks, months. It all depends on the body's ability to recuperate. Can I see my son, Doctor? He is recovering in the ICU. You can see him. But I would like to limit the guests to one at a time. If you'll follow me. Angs, don't worry, huh? Rody's gonna be okay. Jules, man, you know, I don't know what else to say other than I'm sorry, man. It's my little brother Rody. It's my little brother, man. Yo, man, it's almost visiting hours. I'm gonna go see if they're letting people in. All right, man. Hey. Hey. How's Rody? The same. Still unconscious. I can't imagine what Jules is going through, what his whole family is going through. I feel so sorry for them. How are you? Compared to all this, I feel like my problems are stupid. Nothing about you is stupid. Vance, I'm sorry the way things ended up. You did what you had to do. I... Yo, they're letting people in. All right, man. I'll be right in. They're only letting in two people at a time. You wanna go first? I can't. I have to teach a class. It's really good you came. - I just... - Maybe... I gotta go. Rody... wake up. I need you. I need you. I'm gonna make this all better, little man. I swear. Vance, is that you? Are you home? Yeah, Mom. I'm home. I have such exciting news. I'm not really in the mood for exciting news, Mom. After today, everything's going to be all right. He came for us, Vance. He... He came to take us home. Hello, son. He's changed, Vance. He feels so bad for what happened, and he promises it'll never happen again. You got nothing to say to your old man? No. Vance, come back here. You can't be like that. Stop it. Give me back my drink. I paid for it. - No chance. I'm thirsty. - Give it back. Oh, my God. You just don't mind your own business, do you? I'm making it my business. What are you gonna do now, juggle some sweaters? No. No juggling this time. Stop it! Oh, my God. Vance, you're scaring me. Jules. I am so sorry. I don't even know what to say. Ain't nothing to say. My little brother's lying on a hospital bed right now, wires and tubes coming from every part of his body. And it's all my fault. No, don't say that. You weren't there when it happened. There's nothing that you could've done. But I told him. I said, "If you ain't got a ball, go steal one." No. Jules, baby, you didn't mean that when you said it, and you know it, okay? This... This is not your fault. A ball. A stupid basketball. I'd give him 100 basketballs right now if it'd wake him up. So regardless of what I said before, I want you to know that I will always be there for you. Okay? Hey, whenever you need me. Come here. Ever since I came back, you are never here. Ever! But I have to work. I haven't had a good meal since I've been here. I'm sorry. I can cook now. Vance! And you. What? You too good to talk to your old man? You gotta talk to me now, don't you? Please, Daniel, just let him... No, you shut up! Just shut up! You think you're better than me, don't you, huh? Huh? You wanna punch your old man. I've got a better idea. I'm not a kid anymore. Game. I'm gonna teach you some respect. You tired? Ball. Hey, yo, Jules? Hey, pretty girl, how you holding up? - I'm okay. - You sure? Well, maybe this will help you feel a little better. Thank you. - How about your mama? - She's sleeping. Do you know where Jules is? Jules left. Left. To the hospital? Where'd he go? He said he wanted to go fix things. To fix things, huh? Okay, well, you stay safe, Angie. Keep smiling, all right? Okay. Hello? Did Maurice ever tell you where the Gathering takes place? The Gathering? Why? Jules wants revenge, and I don't think he's thinking straight. Against Maurice? Please, Lena, just tell me where it is. He told me it took place at the warehouse at New Dock Street in Brooklyn. All right. Thank you so much. Don't. Don't do this, Jules. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't. I can give you two, man... Ang and your mother. I'm doing this for them and Rody, too. This chump don't deserve to live. Yo, if you kill him, you will ruin your life, too. - I don't care anymore. - I care. You're better than he is, Jules. Look, your mom has gone through enough pain. Let's take away everything he's got... his court, this duel. We got him this time, man. Come on. All right. Let's get him, man. Ain't no losing this time. This is it. Final game. Winner takes all. Yo, Jules, I had no ill will towards little man. He ran in front of the car, and that was that. Before the end of this game, I'm gonna see you bleed. Game! Accepted. - Vance! - What? Damn! So, did you win? That depends. On what? On whether or not I have you. So I forgot to ask you. How do you like your new place? It's nice. Definitely cleaner. And closer to me. That's the best part. Yo, yo. Keep it PG-13, partner. I missed you, crony. Me, too, man. I haven't seen you since you moved to this new crib. Well, we movin' on up. Mostly 'cause of you. I guess I should say thank you or something, huh? - You don't have to say anything. - Good, 'cause I wasn't planning on it. What about you, little man? How long till you're bouncing around with that camera again? - The doctor said six months. - That's nothing. And my brother said I can play with the basketball any time I want now. Good for you, buddy. Pound it. - You taking care of my girl? - I'm trying. - Good, 'cause if you don't... - I know. I know. Easy. All right. Look, enough with the death threats, all right? Let's go get some grub. Oh, do it. Yo, dude, I really miss you, homey. - For real... - Game! What you say? For old time's sake? Go get them. - How much? - 300.
