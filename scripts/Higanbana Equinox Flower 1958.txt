Lots of newly weds. Not a lot of pretty brides though. Did you see the one on the 15? The fat one? She's the prettiest so far. I wonder what the weather's going to be like. There was a storm warning. April showers bring May flowers. Check it out. Here comes another bride. If you ask me, that girl is far too skinny. Warning: Strong Winds I can't find Mikami. Do you know where Mikami is? I don't think he came. I sent him an invitation, but he didn't show up. Why not? Now let us hear from Mr Hirayama, a close friend of the father of the bride. Is that me? Please sit down. Congratulations, Tomoko! The previous speakers have all said beautiful things. There isn't much I can add. These two have been in love for a long time. Once in a while, I would hear of how their relationship was going. It was always good news. However, I was always surprised by how different their lives were from my own youth. I remember how plain and unsentimental my own wedding was. My wife is sitting right here. And she too can tell you how it was all arranged by our parents. On that regard, our young couple today is very lucky. I envy them. My only advice to them is that they try their best to find happiness, though they may already know that. I hope people tell me about your ideal marriage one day so I can envy you even more. Thank you. Congratulations again. Thank you. It was my pleasure. What year was that? I think it was in 1942 or 1943. I passed by Kure, returning home. Was Mikami still there? His shipboard duty was later. He brought me to the Officers' Club. His treat. He'd reached his peak then. He still had a few good years. Have some more. Hasn't Mikami's daughter reached marriageable age? Yeah, she's a year younger than mine. - Is that the girl I saw you with today? - No, that was my other daughter. I see. What about your daughter? I suppose she's reached that age, too. Most of us had girls. You had boys? Yes, I have two sons. I heard that if the husband is the strongest, then the couple will have girls, and if the wife is stronger, they'll have boys. Is that right? The first child is usually a girl. Does that mean the man is stronger early in the marriage? It's possible. I think it's odd in your case. How come? Because you have two boys. You should ask my wife. I'm not a very passionate man. You're full of it! Welcome. It's just like a reunion, isn't it? Welcome. Welcome. - It's been a while since I've seen you. - Indeed. Hello. Congratulations, Mr Kawai. How was the wedding? I'm glad the weatherman was wrong. Won't you get a bit lonely now that your daughter is married? I'm adapting. - How many do you have? - How many what? Husbands? I mean, how many children do you have? Oh, children. I've got three. I bet they're all boys. That's right. How did you know? We can just tell. So it must be true. Yes, it's got to be. Wouldn't be right otherwise. What do you mean? We're just admiring your looks. More sake please. Yes, yes. They're up to something. Welcome home. Welcome home. Where did you all go? Wakamatsu. Mrs Kawai must have been lonely all alone. - Where's Setsuko? - She hasn't come home yet. She's not home yet? It's too late for her. The reception was lovely. The bride was beautiful. Her bridal kimono was so beautiful. - Have you spoken to Setsuko yet? - Yes. What did she say? She didn't say anything. She just grinned. She should think about it. I know, but still... He's a fine young man. She should make a decision. I suppose you're right. He's from a good family, too. Takanashi told me his grandfather used to be President of the Yokohama Chamber of Commerce. Is that so? He was very prominent. Is this marriage talk? You don't need to rush. What do you mean? I'm sure my sister has her own thoughts on this, like I do. You do? I would just hate having an arranged marriage. Is that so? Of course. You're worrying me. You don't need to worry. I can find a husband on my own. That's good to know. Find a good one, Hisako. No problem. I have lots of boyfriends. Is that so? Sister? I'm home. I'm locking the door. Sure. That's fine, isn't it? Yes. I'm home. - Welcome back. - You're late. I was chatting with a friend. Were you on a date? You're being silly. How did the bride look, Mother? She was beautiful. That's great. It smells nice. I bet my sister has one. What do you mean? Boyfriend. I don't know. Does she have one? I'm not sure, but I think she does. Then I don't have to worry about her either. You would worry anyway. Well, good night. Good night. I'll get your thing ready for tomorrow. What for? Isn't there a funeral tomorrow? A suit and a black tie will do. It's so confusing, a funeral right after a wedding. Come in. Mr Mikami is here. Hello. Hello. I thought I'd pop in. I'm not bothering you, I hope. No, not at all. Why didn't you come to the wedding? I had to excuse myself. - Is anything the matter? - No, nothing serious. Not really. What's the matter? I just didn't want to go. Why? What happened? I just wasn't in the mood to see a happy wedding. Why not? I was thinking of my daughter. We talked about that. Did anything happen to your daughter? Did someone mention her? Just that all of our daughters were of marriageable age. Fumiko has left home. Why? When did it happen? About two months ago. She's living with a man. I didn't know that. It's very disconcerting. It's partly my fault, of course. How does she support herself? I heard she was working in a bar in Ginza. Have you heard of a place called Luna? Luna? No, I've never heard of that bar. I can't just go see her like that. If you get a chance, will you check on her? I suppose I could. But what happened? Come in. Mrs Sasaki of Kyoto is here. - Mrs Sasaki? - Yes. Excuse me. I'll get going. You've got a customer, right? You don't have to leave. I'll come back. Thank you so much. All right. - I'll see you soon. - Yes, see you soon. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. It's been a while. Very true. - Have a seat. - Thank you. - When did you arrive to Tokyo? - Yukiko and I got here yesterday. I see. It's really been a while. How is the family? How is Hisako? We're all doing well. Thank you for the bamboo shoots. They weren't very good. I'm embarrassed. Matsu and I figured out what happened. We divided the guests at our Kyoto inn into two classes. We meant to send you the good quality bamboo shoots. By the time we realised our mistake, it was too late. The bamboo shoots had already turned into bamboo. I was just telling Matsu about our terrible mistake. We thought about sending you good ones, but there were none left. They had all become bamboo trees. - I don't need bamboo trees. - Of course, what's the use for those? - Why did you come to Tokyo? - Me? Yes. Because of Yukiko. What about her? I'll tell you the whole story. It's like this. Yukiko won't take my advice. She's always arguing. - What about? - Marriage. I see. Well, congratulations! No, nothing's set yet. You know that doctor from the Tsukiji market? I don't believe I do. He stays at our inn when he travels to Kyoto. I'm guessing you send him the good bamboo shoots. I certainly do. You've never seen him at our inn? Is he a possible prospect? No, not him. Pay attention. He's over 60 years old. He's much too old for Yukiko. Then who is it? An assistant who's also a doctor. That's good. That doctor is young and kind. When he stayed at our inn, he took very good care of... Yukiko? No, he treated me. Do you remember my chronic disease? What was it again? I'm not taking too much of your time, am I? I'm actually a bit busy. Really? I apologise. It might be my heart. I suddenly feel it tighten up and I have difficulty breathing. I think I might be dying. This young doctor told me to get a full physical, but I'm scared of what they might do to me. I'm scared of the drill at the dentist. I almost faint when I see it approaching. I always end up rushing home. If I were to get into this human dock... Hold on. What is it? Excuse me. I need to go to the toilet. Please, go ahead. Or maybe I should leave. Take your time. All right, then. - Please serve tea in the reception room. - Yes. - Should I wait? - No, you can leave. - Is anybody home? - Yes. Welcome! I'm Yukiko Sasaki from Kyoto. Just a moment, please. Hello. It's good to see you. Hello. Make yourself at home. Thank you. Where is everybody? They go shopping on Sundays. I see. Come on in. You'll like the other room better. You must be a second-rate customer. Yes, you should give me bad bamboo shoots. Right. There. For you. Thank you. Ms Tomizawa, please bring tea and cakes. Right away. I have a gift for you. Thank you. Did your mother go to the hospital? She finally decided to go. Too much fussing? Yes, the night before she got admitted, she went on and on about how she didn't know what to do and how she just wanted to cancel the appointment and return to Kyoto. She wouldn't listen to anything I say. But you persuaded her? She was being completely irrational, so I told her, "Mother, I'm worried about your health, so do this or I'll leave home." So she finally listened to me. Really? I had to be firm. There are good hospitals in Kyoto, too. I know. This is just Mother's little setup. - Setup? - Yes. - Please. - Thanks! Tokyo and Kyoto are so different. What about your mother's setup? Did she tell you about my marriage? Yes, she said something a young doctor at the hospital. I know what she's thinking. She gets hospitalised so I visit the hospital everyday, and then she sets me up with the doctor. She's so transparent. Do you like this doctor? No, I'm not interested in him. Then I feel sorry for your mother. I understand, but this is for her health. I suppose it is. What will you do in the meantime? I'm going shopping, and then I'm heading back to Kyoto. You're leaving your mother? That's right. It's very cruel! I know, but I need to take drastic measures if I'm going to stop her from constantly trying to choose my husband. I can't take it anymore. Does she do that? Constantly. Anyway, I don't want to leave Matsu alone at the inn. Do you have someone in your life already? No, I don't. You shouldn't rush to get married. That's true. I mean it. What first looks like gold might turn out to be brass once you're married. Really? Brass? That's right. You don't need to get married now. Why should every girl rush to get married? Why not be different? You've no plans to marry Setsuko? In a way, I do. Regardless, a pretty girl like you shouldn't hurry to marry brass. Your family is late. They didn't tell me anything. When they get back, I'll tell Setsuko to come and visit you tomorrow. Yes, I'd love to see her. It's such a lovely day. Indeed. - It's time for your medicine. - Right. This tastes awful! What is this? There's sulphur in it. Really? Why? Do I have to finish it? Yes. I'd rather not. Is she here yet? - Your daughter? - Yes. No, not yet. Where is she? She's late. She only visited me once this morning. Mother's room is right round here. I see. Did you meet this doctor? Yes, but only briefly. - What do you think of him? - I'm not interested in him. It was Mother's idea. So annoying. But what about you? What about me? Isn't there some plan to marry you? No, not really. Father's interested, that's all. Really? They should really stop putting us through this. Is she that persistent? It's all she talks about. The other day, a man with a tuxedo and a white scarf walked past us. Mother asked if I wanted him for a husband. So I turned round to look at him, and I saw an advert for a nightclub on his back. I envy you, Setsuko. Your parents aren't like my mother. They're so understanding. I wouldn't be so sure of that. They're not like Mom at all. She always goes on and on and never gets to the point. She has an interesting way of talking. Yeah, too interesting, if you ask me. Setsuko, we should team up. What do you mean? You help me when my mother's being unreasonable, and I'll do the same for you. - That sounds good. - Remember, I'm relying on you. Will you take a pledge? What was that? It means, "13 silver hairpins, bloody broken spider webs, and three..." - It's an incantation. - I see. In that case... Thank you. - Should I wait? - No, you can leave. Hello. - Excuse me. - Yes? I'm happy to see you again. This is a surprise. Welcome. Come in. May I? I hope I'm not bothering you. It's all right. Come in. Thank you. Have a seat. - Welcome. - Hello. I'm sorry to bother you. I brought this as a present. Thank you very much. It's for the family, not for you. I know. I'm sorry. Are you busy with something? I knew we'd talk long, so I went to the toilet. I see. Is Hisako at school? Yes, and Setsuko's at work. They're both lovely girls. Yukiko returned home without me. You got in a human dock, didn't you? It's such a horrible place. They sent electricity through wires around my hands and feet, and injected me with some kind of blue ink. It turned everything blue. It was horrible. That's not all. I had to drink this muddy, plaster-like substance. It tasted horrible. I was supposed to stay three more days, but I just couldn't take it. But you finished your treatment? Yes, there's no need for them to poke and prod me anymore. I don't need to be their patient anymore. And what about your heart? The old doctor told me it was fine. He said it was just neurosis. I tell him I still have pains, but he doesn't listen. Isn't that outrageous? I'm glad there was nothing serious. I didn't need to come all the way to Tokyo. It's always better to be sure. Yes, I suppose it is. But what about the young doctor? He's the one who did it. What do you mean? He's the one who injected the blue ink. I begged him to stop. He said it was necessary. He was cruel. I hate him. You wanted to match him with Yukiko. I'll find another prospect for her. You must help me. I'll do my best. I'm doing all I can, but Yukiko just keeps telling me to leave her alone and not bother her. Children are so ungrateful. Our children are the same. It must be the same everywhere. You think? If we wait too long, Yukiko will never get married. She'll find someone. She's capable and pretty, too. - Do you really think so? - I do. I know. In fact, I already have another prospect lined up. Who is he? He's not a doctor, but it's close. - What does he do? - He's a pharmacist. He is the second son of an important pharmacist in Osaka. He's a bit old, though. I can't remember if he's 24 or 25 years old. He graduated from Osaka University. Maybe this will be the one. You certainly have a lot of candidates! That man is ideal. I tell you... Hold on. Excuse me a moment. Please, go ahead. Wrong way. That's right. Are you sure I'm not bothering you? Don't go too far! Don't worry! The weather is so nice. It's rare that we get to go out like this. The weather really is nice. Maybe I should take advantage of it and go for a game. - You mean golf? - Yes. Please, not today. This may be the last time we go out if Setsuko gets married. You're right. But why wouldn't we go out again before she marries? You're always too busy. Why does she just grin without saying anything? You mean Setsuko? I was the same at her age. Times have changed, though. Should I go ahead? Sure, I suppose it's all right. It certainly is nice weather today. Do you remember? What? Remember how we ran to the air-raid shelters when the planes came during the war? Setsuko had just started grade school. Hisako was a toddler. In the dark, we used to think we might all die together. I remember. I hated the war, but sometimes I miss those days when we were all so much closer. Don't you? No, those were the years I hated the most. We had nothing of value. We were surrounded by arrogance. Right, but, for me, those were good days. We were always together, all four of us. Are you complaining because I've been coming home late? No, it's not that. But we don't even get to have supper as a family anymore. It gets busier at work everyday. But there are more comforts we're able to enjoy. Even so. What are you saying? Forget it. I had trouble yesterday at Bunker 7. I've also had difficulties there. I went to Hakone with my family yesterday. That's nice. How did you like it? I spent the whole day with my family. I see. It must feel good to do that from time to time. Indeed. Come in. What is it? The person on the business card is asking to see you. Okay. Bring him in. Yes. Come in. Come. I should introduce myself. My name is Taniguchi. I'm Hirayama. The Nitto Chemical Company? My daughter works there. Yes. Why did you want to see me? Well... I wish to marry your daughter. Excuse me? I'd like to get your consent. - You want to marry her? - Yes. Is Setsuko aware of this? She is. I should've asked you through an intermediary, but I don't have a lot of time. Time? My company is transferring me, and I wanted to get your consent before I go. It's all very sudden. I know. I apologise. I can't give you an answer right now. I must discuss this with Setsuko. I understand. You should leave. Yes, please take it under consideration. - Hello. - Hello. This is a quote from Hill Enterprise. Just leave it here. Yes. You didn't know about this? No, Setsuko never said anything. It's a problem. I'm home. Setsuko. - What's wrong? - Come here. Sit down. What is it? Do you know a man named Taniguchi? Yes. He came to my office today. Did you know about that? No, I didn't. He wants to marry you. How do you know him? From work. How long have you known him? Do you intend to marry him? Answer me. Yes, I wish to marry him. Why didn't you say anything? Why didn't you consult me? You knew we had another man in mind. I don't approve of this Taniguchi. But I... What? Why can't I find happiness on my own? Setsuko. I'll find happiness on my own! - Where are you going? - I'll be back soon. Setsuko! Come in. It's you. What's going on? Come. Why did you go see my father without telling me? Why didn't you tell me? This way was better. Why? I didn't think you should worry. What? I told you before I would tell Mother and have her tell Father. I considered that, too. It would have ended up the same. What makes you say that? The answer is either yes or no. I would know sooner if I was direct. You know I'm being transferred to Hiroshima. I heard. That's why I went to see your father. What if Father says no? I've already made up my mind. Have you? Do you even need to ask? I'm not leaving you. Then we've got nothing to fear. This is how it should be. Everything's fine now. It's late. You should go. Let me take you home. Come on. - Good night. - Good night. - Goodbye. - Thank you. I just came to take her home. Thank you. Thank you. Has she come back? Yes. Setsuko! Yes? Sit down. Where have you been? You're being careless, don't you think? Making such a decision without consulting us first? This is a mistake, don't you think? Answer me. Why don't you say something? Don't get angry. I'm not talking to you. What is going on in that head of yours, Setsuko? I'm trying to spare you an unhappy marriage. I have to protect you from anything that would make you unhappy. Do you really know this Taniguchi? I do. And you think he'll make a good husband? I do. He's not from a distinguished family like you would've liked, but I really don't think that'll make me unhappy. You're confused and misguided. That's just the way you see things. Setsuko! My opinions are different. I see things my own way. Do you? Then explain it to me. Even if I explained it to you, you wouldn't understand. What's that? Setsuko! Mother! You two were lucky from the start. We might not have the chance to have the kind of life Father has in mind. We don't care. I don't think it would make us unhappy. We will take responsibility for our own lives. And we won't bother you about things like that. But, Setsuko... Don't say another word. You're still young, Setsuko. A lot can happen in life. You two are in love. It may be enough for now, but who knows what the future will bring? There's a lot you need to consider. You said that we were lucky. It wasn't always like that for your father and me. We went through difficult times. That's why your father is so concerned. Do you understand? Promise me you'll think it over? Enough. I'm opposed to it. The young make trouble as soon as they go out into the world. Stay home two or three days to think things over. I have to go to work. You will do as I say. You don't have to go. Setsuko, you should go to bed now. She is so taxing. But... Taniguchi looks like a good man. You've met him? Yes, at the door, when he brought her back. How can you know him after meeting him only once. You're being ridiculous. Anyway, I can't consent. Come in. You called me? Yes, come here please. Right away. I didn't take you away from your work? No. - Then you were just killing time? - Yes. No, I mean... No, I guess not. - But there's something I want to ask you. - Me? What? How well do you know Taniguchi? We went to the same school. He was a senior. I see. He is two years older than me, and he played basketball. I see, and what else? Is that all you know? We worked in the same office one summer. You did? Where? It was a warehouse in Hakozaki. I see. Come in. Mr Mikami is here. Bring him in. Yes. - We'll talk later. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. - Thank you. I'm sorry to be a bother. Not at all. I don't want to be a nuisance, but have you had a chance? Have you had a chance to go to Luna? I've been a bit preoccupied. I haven't had a chance yet. I see. There's no need to rush, of course. I'm just a little worried. I'll go tonight. You will? I appreciate it very much. Children can be a handful. Maybe it's because we spoil them as parents. But what can we do? Isn't it ironic? Welcome. I haven't seen you in a while, Mr Kondo. How have you been? Is this all right for you? Welcome. Welcome. What can I serve you? One highball. Certainly. How about you, Kondo? - The same for you? - Yes. Make it two. You've been here before? Yes... No. - They all seem to know you. - Yes. Then why didn't you just say so? We would've found this place in no time. I apologise. I didn't think this was the place you meant. Then what other place? There can't be that many bars with the same name. Right, there can't be. I apologise. Is there a Fumiko working here? Her last name is Mikami. We call her Kaoru. She'll be back in a moment. There you go. This one's for Kondo. Why so quiet tonight? Go ahead. Yes, I will. That Taniguchi, what's he like? He's two years older than me, and he plays basketball... You said that already. Yes, he played offensive. He had a good lay-up. I mean, what kind of man is he? His character. He's a good man. How good is he? I don't know him that well, but he's pleasant. You told me you had worked with him. He worked at a desk, and I was just the delivery guy. So you don't know him very well at all. No, I suppose I don't. Why didn't you just tell me that? I apologise. She's right here. Are you looking for me? - Are you Fumiko? - Yes. Do you remember me? I'm Hirayama, a friend of your father. Let's have a seat. It's been a while since I've last seen you. Indeed. How are you? I'm fine. Did my father tell you I was working here? Yes, and I was curious how you were doing. Well, I don't need advice. I just want to be left alone. No, I didn't come here for that. Can we talk somewhere more private? What do you want to talk about? Well, can't we talk anywhere more private? I can't leave right now. I understand. I'll wait until you finish your shift. Is that okay? Where's your usual liveliness? What's wrong? What's the matter? Don't act so familiar. That man's my boss. Then you can drink all you want. It's not like that. Want another one? Not tonight. Don't stand here. Go away. You're such a scaredy-cat. Come again? I'll get you for this. - Welcome! - Welcome! - You! - Yes! Thank you. Do you always wait for him around this time? He'll be here soon. We always go home together. He's a nightclub musician? Yes. He's a pianist. In school, he studied music. I see. What do you think of your father? My father? I feel sorry for him, but he's just so stubborn. Stubborn? He's just so stuck in his ways. Too much so. Too much so? He thinks his way is the only way. Really? Is that what you think? Yes, it is. Father has to have everything his way. - Surely you're exaggerating. - No, it's the truth. Maybe it's because he worries about you. He shouldn't. He's your father. What about you? Are you happy? Me? Yes. I'm happy. I don't see myself as unfortunate at all. I see. Welcome. He's here. Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! - This is... - I'm Naganuma. It's a pleasure to meet you. Hello. How do you do? It's getting late. We'll head home. Fine. Thank you for coming. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hold on. - Yes? Here's some spending money. I can't take this. It isn't much. I just can't. I'm sorry. Thank you. Come again. Welcome home. Where were you tonight? I went to see Mikami's daughter. Fumiko? Is there something wrong? She's managing somehow, but it's not right. Did Setsuko stay home today? Yes, what are we going to do about her? Leave her alone for a while. Soon, she'll realise what she's asking. Are you still up? Yes, I couldn't sleep. Setsuko! Did you... What? Did you sleep with him? Father, you should have more trust in me. He's not that kind of man. Tell her to think it over. Tell her not to go to work. She can even leave her job. Keep an eye on her. Don't let her go out. I will not allow this kind of behaviour, or a wedding. You understand? Nightgown. - Welcome! - Welcome! Why were you so quiet the other night? Do you know how nervous I was? You were sweating like a pig. This place needs air conditioning. - Kondo, what would you like? - A highball, with water. - Same as last time? - I can't afford a brand like that. My usual brand, please. Cheap. Not that expensive stuff. - Right? - Right, let your boss treat you to that. He won't come here again. Kaoru. How does your father know my boss? They went to high school together. What does he do now? - He works for a printing company. - He came to see my boss yesterday. Really? Did you hear anything? I'm not sure. I wasn't in the room for very long. Sorry to keep you waiting. Now, that tastes good! It tastes so much better when I pay for it myself, even if it is the cheap stuff. Get me some peanuts. You're much livelier tonight. Of course. Last night was an exception. Where are my peanuts? Don't be so stingy. If you get pompous, your boss might come back. Don't scare me like that. He won't come back to a dump like this. Give me my peanuts! - Welcome! - Welcome! - Welcome and thank you for the other night. - Not at all. Welcome. Hello. You're here again? Yes, sir. You must be a regular customer. Yes, but not really. Your father came to see me yesterday. He asked me to give you this since he doesn't know your address. He would like to see you. What do you say? It's no use. Well, just think it over. Goodbye. Goodbye. You can sit down again now. Unbelievable! How did you know he was coming? It ruined my highball. Give me a match. - Ever been to the Luna Bar? - Sure, I was there last night. Well, be careful, because the boss is a patron. - You saw him there? - Yeah. Hello? A call from Miss Sasaki? I'll talk to her. Yukiko? You're back in Tokyo? When did you arrive? You want my advice? What about? I'll come see you on the way home. Talk to you soon. Yes, goodbye. You have a visitor. - Hello. - Thank you for coming. - What is going on? - Well... How is your mother doing? Well, that's what I need to talk to you about. What's the matter? I can't take it anymore. What's wrong? Did you get into an argument with her? You can tell me. She's being unreasonable. It's why I came to Tokyo. I'm not sure what you mean. I ran away from home. Does she know? No. This isn't good. Please, have some tea. What was your fight about? Mother just won't listen to a word I say. Like? I'll tell you the whole story. Please do. I've found a man I love. I see. And? - Mother doesn't approve. - Why not? She always wants things to be her way. This time, I'm not going to give in. I've made a promise. What is this man like? I've known him for quite a while, but Mother wants me to wed a pharmacist from Osaka. She says he's from a proper family with a lot of money. She insists I marry him. She just tells me to do as she says. She keeps telling me that Osaka is on the path of fortune. It's not funny. Listen. Mother told Matsu to buy me fried bean curd for tomorrow, and she said I should go to Fushimi temple to give thanks to the Fox God. Did you go? Why would I? It's ridiculous. What happened then? Mom was very angry at me because I rejected such an attractive prospect. She told me I'd be punished by the Fox God. She was furious, so I left home. That makes a lot of leftover bean curd. Mother and Matsu are eating it now. I imagine the guests at the inn must be eating some, too. Really? Quite a picture! I don't have to do what Mother says, do I? - No, not in this instance. - It's okay if I don't do as she says? - Right. - It's my whole future. That's right. So I guess I can marry the man I love. - Is he honest and dependable? - Absolutely. Then you should do it. It's your responsibility. I know. Forget what your mother is telling you. You really think I should? I'm so happy to hear that. Why were you so confused? I wasn't confused. I've got to make a call now. - To whom? - I'm calling your house to tell Setsuko. What? I'll explain. I made it all up. It was all a setup. A setup? Yes, it was all a trick. I'm going to tell Setsuko you consent to her marriage. Wait a minute! Wait! Welcome home. I didn't hear you come in. It all turned out well. I don't know what I would've done if Setsuko had done the same as Mikami's daughter. I'm so relieved. You're a very good father. Thank you. Excuse me? Setsuko is so happy to have your consent. - Consent? - To marry Taniguchi. I didn't give my consent. But she just got a call from Yukiko. That was her own doing. But... - I really had no say in the matter. - I see. If that's how you feel, it's good enough. I'm not sure what you mean. I mean, about Setsuko. I refuse to take responsibility for that. She and Taniguchi will take responsibility. She told you so. I can't take their word for it. But... But what? How long have you been conspiring with Taniguchi? How can you say such a thing? Did you really meet Taniguchi only once? No, he came over after I met him that night. Why didn't you say anything? Because you've been in a foul mood and Setsuko asked me not to let him see you. Meeting him once or twice isn't enough. What about Takanashi? You'll have to decline his offer. No, I won't do it. You're the one consenting. You decline. I won't be held responsible for this. Fine, I'll do it. Then do it. I wash my hands of this. I don't approve, so I won't be present at the wedding either. You at least have to be there. No! I won't come! Then I won't go either. You can go. You gave your consent. - I won't go. - As you wish. I'm sure they'll manage. How? How do you expect me to know? This proves how irresponsible you're being. You make all kinds of irresponsible statements. Don't make promises you can't keep. It's wrong. And you? What? What are you saying? Forget it. - Tell me. - Forget it. If you have something to say, then say it. Everything always has to be your way. What? You're being completely inconsistent regarding Setsuko. - Inconsistent? - Yes. You said you wouldn't mind Setsuko having a boyfriend, but now that she has one, you disapprove. Don't you think that's strange? That's parental love. You want to call it inconsistent? Definitely. If you loved her, you would take responsibility. Doing otherwise would be inconsistent. Then everybody is inconsistent, apart from God. The world is full of inconsistencies. And all these inconsistencies are what make life. And what about you? You're inconsistent, too! I'm home. - I'm home. - Where's Setsuko? - Did Setsuko go out? - Yes. Where did she go? She's helping Taniguchi pack. How did you know he was leaving tomorrow? I thought you had given your consent when Setsuko called. I said she wasn't allowed to go out. Hisako was with her. - But I left earlier. - Why? I felt like I was in the way. They're not being lovey-dovey or anything, but they're clearly in love. Taniguchi is kind. He's like a big brother. They'll be fine, Father. You shouldn't worry. The train leaves tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. I'll be there with my sister. Stop it! Turn that off! - Hi. - Hi. - Have you been here long? - I got here a while ago. I've been waiting. - You've been sitting here since yesterday? - Yes. - How's the game? - Not so good. I see. Your wife came by last night. She told me about your girl's wedding. Congratulations. My wife came to see you? She asked me to be the intermediary. For whom? For your daughter, at the wedding. I see. - I was told you didn't approve. - Right. - So you're not coming to the wedding? - Right. You don't have to. I'll take care of it. It's hard to see your girl leave home. That's not it. I heard. But this is the way it's got to be. I'll take good care of it. I'm not coming. Then don't. You don't have to. I'll take care of it. - Then it's settled. - Right. Everything's taken care of. We're planning a high school reunion. What do you think? - About what? - About having a high school reunion. Right. Graduates will come join us at Gamagori. I see. Will you come? - Sure. Okay. - It's been a long time. Guess I'll go play a quick game. You want to join me? I'm going to take a breather. I'm a bit tired. All right. Goodbye. - A beer, please. - Yes, sir. Hello? Hello? Hello? Futaba Beauty Parlour? This is the Hirayama residence. Hirayama. Yes, that's correct. Can you get there an hour early tomorrow? The ceremony starts at exactly 2:00 p.m. Okay? We're relying on you. I called the beauty parlour. They'll be there on time. Thank you. Come have some party food with us. Thank you. - Father's late. Where is he? - He's probably busy at work. I told him this morning to come home early. Tomorrow's Setsuko's wedding. It's okay, Hisako. I don't understand why he won't eat with us tonight. Your father has his concerns, and he's dealing with them his way. He's hired a private investigator to check up on Taniguchi. I saw the report. - Are you going to eat that? - You can have it. I wasn't able to do a lot for you. Tell me if you need anything. I'll send it to you later. I already have enough, Mother. You don't need to send anything. Our place is going to be fairly small. No matter how small, there's no place like home. You probably have a lot to take care of. You can go upstairs if you want. Right. Our visit to Hakone was our last outing as a family. I'd hoped we'd have more. We could have had more if Father had wanted. Hisako. It's okay, Setsuko. You should get Taniguchi to take you places. Isn't Miyajima close to where you'll live? I'm not sure. I'd love to go, too. You should visit us during the summer. Can I? Really? I'd love that. Of course. I really am coming over. Setsuko, you should go now. Right. Goodnight. Mother, I heard Setsuko crying last night. I had trouble sleeping. When I asked her why she was crying, she just turned off the light. I see. It's Father's fault. Why does he dislike Taniguchi? He's so kind. Father's too old-fashioned! Welcome home. Welcome home. We've already had supper. What is this? You'll come to the wedding? I don't have much of a choice. All our friends will be there. I see. Setsuko, your father will be there tomorrow. He's coming to your wedding! I'm so happy! But I knew he would. Now everything's going to be just fine. There's no need to cry. You have a big day ahead of you, so clean up and go to bed. Good. - Mother? - What is it? I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I caused you all this trouble. Forget it. I just want you to be happy. Now clean up. - Hisako, go help your sister. - Okay. Setsuko is really happy. We need you there tomorrow. Do you want some party food? You don't? You're so carefree. How so? I never thought she would defy me. It's not defiance. For some reason, I'm less than convinced. Something's not right. Getting married is a big event in her life, but she took that decision without discussing it with us first. That troubles me. We, too, were interested in her getting married. - The mahjong table is set. - I see. - Let's go ahead. - Yeah. - Please bring beer to the next room. - Yes, sir. - Let's see if I'm lucky tonight! - Let's do it! So this is what happened. I was the intermediary because his wife asked me. But Hirayama dislikes the groom. - Why? - Well... It's nearly impossible to find someone good enough for our daughters because we spend so much time raising them only to give them away to a stranger. How many children do you have, Sugai? None? Sugai has a lot of children. Six, wasn't it? Seven? I bet they're all girls. Yeah, right. They've got to be. - So are they? - Forget it. You keep seeing them as children, then suddenly they're all grown up. That's right. That's the way it's got to be. Mikami, why don't you sing us a song? - Which one? - The one you sang when we went to Kure. - Not that. - Which one is that? - It's a song based on a poem. - Oh, I want to listen. - Go on, Mikami. - Go on. - Come on! - All right, fine. But it's kind of out-of-date. This is based on a farewell poem by the patriot Masatsura Kusunoki. It's pretty long, so you should drink while you're listening. That's enough. I'm stopping now. - Isn't there more? - Sure. - You should go on if there's more. - Go on. It's not enough. - Go on. - That's enough. It's inspiring. I agree. So, you've met with your daughter? She comes by to the house now. They're managing. I'm satisfied. Raising children is sometimes very hard. Eventually, parents have to let go. And that's never easy. I suppose it isn't. We're getting old. We're talking about our children at a high school reunion. True. But we carry the dreams of our youth with us forever. - I'm home. - Welcome home. - Mr Hirayama of Tokyo is here. - Really? Where is he? In the back room. Hello! Welcome back. Welcome. Thank you for coming to Setsuko's wedding. It was my pleasure. Congratulations on this happy occasion! What brings you to Kyoto? After my high school reunion, I went to Osaka. I see. Have you taken care of all your affairs? Yes. Yukiko, what was it again? When Setsuko and her husband stopped at our inn... - What? - What was the food they liked so much? - Those were the pickled rape blossoms. - Yes, they really liked them. He said, "This tastes nice." And she said, "That's right." He said, "Do you like it?" And she said, "Yes, I do." They are perfect for each other. Isn't that right, Yukiko? They stayed in this room. Thank you for being so generous to them. They were no trouble at all. They only stayed one night. I invited them to stay longer, but they just visited some of the sights and left. Really? Taniguchi is very kind. I hope Yukiko finds a nice husband like him. I would love to find a man like Taniguchi. What is it you don't like about him? I've nothing against him personally. Would you mind coming over, please? - You need me? - Yes, please. Excuse me. - Please, have some more. - Thank you. I apologise for what I did the other day. I'm sorry? Don't be angry. Please forgive me. You mean the setup? Wouldn't I make a good actress? You were very convincing. You had me completely fooled. - Did you make it all up? - I'm sorry? You haven't found a man you want to marry? I haven't, unfortunately. I can't seem to find anyone. Why not? I just don't have time. You mother wants you to get married. That's what she always says. It's just a habit at this point. I doubt that. It's true. She just likes saying it. But, in reality, she really doesn't want me to leave home. I don't believe that for a second. She keeps picking candidates and then finds all kinds of problems with them. She's like a child playing with building blocks. Is that what you think? It makes it difficult for me. It's time you thought this over seriously. I can't get married and abandon my mother. If I leave, she'll spend all her days fighting with Matsu. They'll mess up the inn. Matsu is such a patient woman. Why couldn't someone marry into your family? No man could last long with my mother around. You shouldn't worry so much about your mother. The parent is devoted to the child. The child's happiness is all that matters. You think? You shouldn't keep yourself from marriage because of your mother. That's odd. What makes you say that? You once told me not to marry. Did I? You said something about gold and brass. Yes, I remember. What you must do is to turn the brass into gold. You should get married. It's time. Your advice has completely changed. I'm confused. Should I or shouldn't I get married? It would be better if you did. This isn't a setup? I'm not as good an actor as you are. Think about it. If you find a good man, marry him. If you find happiness, so will your mother. I'll think about it. Think it over carefully. Always busy! You have a guest? It's a man from the tax office. Yukiko, would you mind going for me? Remember that handsome man with the nice neckties? He's asked us to bring our seal. Is he your newest candidate? I would like that. Do you know what Setsuko said? What? She said you didn't look happy at the wedding. She said you didn't even smile once. That's what troubled her most. Did she tell you that? I feel so sorry for Setsuko. You should show her your smile. It's easy. Why don't you do it now? I'm not sure what you mean. Yukiko, what do you think of him leaving for Hiroshima this instant? That's a terrific idea, Mother. You should go there right away. Hiroshima? So she'll stop worrying. Excellent! Then it's decided. I can't just leave my business. This is more important. Call to Tokyo before he backs out. Right. Wait a minute! Hold on! You're so full of good ideas. I'm pretty clever. Yes. Take him to the phone. Right away. Get me Tokyo. This is Gion 2784. Mrs Hirayama? It's Yukiko in Kyoto. Mr Hirayama is going to Hiroshima to visit Setsuko. He'll explain everything. Quick. Mrs Hirayama is on the line. Here. Hi, it's me. That's right. I'm thinking of going. I think that's what I'll do. You're really going to Hiroshima? I'm so happy. Setsuko will be so surprised. I haven't made up my mind yet. It's not necessary for me to go. It's a long way. Why are you laughing? You know what your trouble is? I know how I am. Anyway, you should go. Don't worry. I'm very happy. Setsuko will be so glad. I'm glad, too. This isn't about making you happy. You see... I know. I'm very happy. Send her my love. Enjoy your trip. Goodbye. Excuse me. - I would like to send a telegram. - Certainly. Arriving at Hiroshima 2:18 p.m. Father. - You got it? - Yes, sir. - I'll have it sent from Osaka. - Please do. EQUINOX FLOWER - THE END
