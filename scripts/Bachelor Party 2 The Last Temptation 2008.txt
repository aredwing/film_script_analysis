No, l just fail to see how you showing up at my museum every day... for, like, two weeks makes me the stalker... when clearly it makes you the stalker. The most important thing to remember here-- Hand, please. These past two months... have really, truly been the happiest two months... - of your life. - [ Laughs ] - l love you. - Love you too. - There you go. W-Wait. Excuse me. [ Singsongy ] Son of a bitch. l keep telling this guy no olives... and he keeps bringing me olives, and that's a problem because-- - You hate olives. - l hate olives! l hate olives. Don't move. l'm on it. There. Crisis averted. You know, usually l would be completely disgusted... with someone sticking their fingers into my drink, but with you, not so much. ln fact, it, uh-- Mmm. lt adds a certain Melinda ''zestiness'' to it. Well, we make a good team. Yes, we do. Well, l am going to go powder my nose. [ Clears Throat ] Oh. Do me a favor-- lf the waiter comes back... would you make sure there are no olives in my cake? l like that. Spence! Spence. All right, man, it's time. - Time for what? - lt's time for me to get engaged. You were gonna put this in her sundae, remember? - [ Whistles ] - Oh, yeah. Right. Nice rock. Oh. Thanks. [ Groaning ] Oh, boy. Oh. Sorry. lt was packed. - l just had to fight for a mirror. - [ Laughs ] Here we are. A sundae for the gentleman. And chocolate cake for the lady. Actually, l think that she had the sundae and l had the cake. Oh, okay, yeah. Got it. Mmm. So, Mel... l'm glad you stalked me... 'cause, um... l never met anyone like you before... and l, uh-- l know that... we've only been dating a little while, but... l just feel like l have known you my-- my-my whole-- my whole life. Are you chewing that? [ Woman ] Oh, my God! PraiseJesus! PraiseJesus! Oh, Calvin! I knew you'd do it. Excuse me one second.Just wanna take that-- [ Chuckles ] Just a little quick search for something. All right. Be right back. - [ Woman ] I'm calling Mama. - Hi. Hi. - l'm sorry. l think there's been a mistake. - Mama! l'm getting married, Mama. Ma'am? Ma'am? Pardon me. Pardon me. That's my ring. Hang on, Mama. May l help you? Yes. l'm so sorry, but l think the waiter... mistakenly brought you the wrong sundae. You see, that-that's my grandmother's ring. l think you better go sit over there before my fianc here... ''whups'' your ass. Okay, how about l buy both of your dinners? Good? Yes. Except l'm gonna need that back though, so-- - Ow! - Okay, baby, ''whup'' his ass! - Uh, baby, the thing is-- - The thing is... I haven't waited 1 7 years on your sorry ass... to let this white shadow come and spoil my engagement. lt's either you whup his ass, Calvin... or l'll whup yours. Yeah. You need to go now. - Right. - [ Woman ] Mama? Yes! Um, how about-- It's beautiful. Thief! Help! [ Shouting ] - [ Groaning ] - Give me my ring! Give me my ring! - [ Siren Blares ] - [ Chuckles ] Well, this wasn't exactly what l had planned. [ Police Radio Chatter ] Look. l know we haven't been together long... but you know when something just feels right... and you don't want that feeling to end? Okay, Romeo, save it for your cell mate. Whoa. Clancy. Give the kid a minute. - Thank you. - No problem. Long story short. l love you. - l love you. - Will, uh-- Will you, uh-- - Will you marry me? - Yes, l will marry you. [ Both Laughing ] Okay. Congrats and all that. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. l'm gonna go now. Dude, are you fuckin'with me? ''Congratulations'' might be the more appropriate response here, Derek. You've only dated her for two months. l've had this cold sore longer than that. This coming from a guy who's been married three times. Have you learned nothing from me, man? l am a cautionary tale. l am Jesus. l have suffered for your sins. - [ Farts ] - [ Groans ] Please let that be a fart. [ Farts ] Yeah, baby! Suck it, losers. Ooh! [ Laughs ] Okay. That was definitely not a fart. You know, l think that ''biatch'' is feeding this thing lndian food just to screw with me. - [ Babbling ] - [ Both Groan ] Yeah, you did a poop. Yeah. Any of you need changing? Hey, where's, uh-- Where's Seth? He's up. He's looking for a ball. Didn't have time to stop at home and get his. We're in a bowling alley. How hard is it to find a ball? [ Boy ] All right! I'll take it! Sorry, fellas. l'm on the D.L. tonight. l don't think there's a disabled list for rec league bowling, buddy. Ron, how can you abandon me with these two losers? l'm not abandoning anybody. Just 'cause l'm getting married doesn't mean l'm not gonna be here for bowling night... or fishing weekend orJason's biannual ''porno palooza.'' You know, nothing's gonna change. Yeah. Well, that's what l thought. Now if you'll excuse me, l gotta get little shit machine... back to his gold-digging whore of a mother, huh? Hey, don't forget your ball. [ Chattering ] l was talking with the mayor... and l put a bug in his ear about having the reception at the opera house. You know, Mom, we were thinking of having a small, simple wedding. [ Laughs ] Honestly, Melinda. We're not Amish. - [ Doorbell Rings ] - l'll get it. - Oh, my little sister's engaged! - [ Laughs ] Hi, beautiful. - Hi, Todd. - Sorry. l can't hear. He's always working. Let me ask you something. ls it wrong to want to tap sister-in-law ass? Right. Oh. l gotta go. - [ Clears Throat ] - Honey. - Yes? - Does this remind you of when we got engaged? - How could l forget? - Let's go on a second honeymoon. Someplace romantic. Maybe make a baby. Hey, there's your dad. Hey. Abe. Did you hear the one about the horny jockey and the Venezuelan stable boy? [ Laughing ] No, but l think l like it already. - [ Todd ] It's delicious. - [ Doorbell Rings ] - [ Children Chattering ln Chinese ] - Hi, guys. [ Chattering Continues ] Speak English, huh? English! Look, go watch some TV, huh? [ Speaks Chinese ] - They're so cute. - Sorry about that. They're from the second marriage. The ex only lets them speak to me in Mandarin, the hairy ass crack. - Yeah. - Anyways-- - Congratulations. - Oh. Thank you. - Here. - Oh. Sure. Uh-- Okay. JJ [ Humming ] Oh! How's my baby? My mother's killing me with wedding crap. - Mmm. - l seriously don't think l can take another year of this. Mmm. Well, we could just elope, of course. Then she'd kill both of us. What are you doing? You. - Mmm! Baby, we're in the pantry. - Oh! That's a good point. [ lnhales ] [ Laughing ] What are you doing? - Oh, my God. - J Sex elevator J Ding. [ Laughs ] You are so stupid. Hey. Would it kill you to buy some groceries, man? Yeah, if the Mystics would cover the goddamn spread, l could. The Mystics? You're bettin' on the W.N.B.A.? Mm-hmm. Well, hello. [ Chuckles ] Hi. l'm-l'm Judith. l-l work with Mel. Oh, hey,Judith. l'm Jason. l'm, uh, Ron's best friend-- since childhood. Yeah. And this is Seth, his college roommate. And that's Derek. Used to be his boss. Yeah. - Are you all in finance? - Actually, l'm in consumer products testing. [ Sniffing ] [ Sneezes ] - Derek, do you still work with Ron? - No. l, uh-- l left that company a while back... but, uh, l'm still in finance, you know. l'm telling you, man, she had a pine tree air freshener in her underpants. Gotta go. - What do you do? - l am in the advertising game. - Yeah. - Advertising? - Mm-hmm. - That sounds exciting. lt is. Yeah, it is. You know,Judith, you're a friend of Mel's and l'm a friend of Ron's... so l'm thinkin' we should get together. You know, maybe-- maybe grab a pizza, fuck. No? You don't like pizza? Seriously, who doesn't like pizza? Hey, uh, everyone? Everyone, um-- l don't know how to say this, but... Mel and l simply could not come to an agreement on our wedding colors... so we are breaking up. Very sorry. Everyone drive safe. - [ Crowd Laughing ] - Yes! Welcome back, buddy. He was kid-- He was kidding. - [ Stammers, Laughs ] - Sorry, Mel. lt's okay. Anyway, uh, two short months ago... l wandered into the Cleveland Museum of Modern Art. l was, of course, lost, um, but then... l laid eyes on the best exhibit in the whole joint-- Mel. - [ Crowd Sighs ] - [ Scoffs ] Uh, no, l know that two months is an awfully short time to get engaged... but, to be honest with you, l was ready to propose on that first day. So needless to say... when Mel proposed, l said yes. - [ Crowd Laughs ] - l didn't want to give her time... to change her mind, so we have set a date. On May 31 , one month from today... you are all invited to our open bar-- - Which will also feature a wedding, but, you know-- - [ Laughing ] All right, let's get drunk. Hey, uh, Derek? Why is your kid dropping a deuce in that plant? Jesus! Stop it! Bah! Bah! Mmm. [ Chuckles ] Now, Abe, l've taken a look at the numbers for last quarters. l think we've got some dead weight. Here, look. Take a look at this. - Hey, hey, fellas. - [ Abe ] Ron, come in. - Abe, you're a whiskey man, is that right? - Absolutely. All right, l got something here for you. What have we got here? Mmm. Oh, that's nice. What is this? Jameson's 30-year Private Reserve. l'm half lrish, so l gotta support the motherland. l brought you a bottle. You're lrish? My mother's from Galway. Geez, it's gonna be great to get some more lrish blood in the family here. You know, Todd here is English, but we try not to think about that. [ Laughs ] - You like Cubans? - Uh, yes. - Thank you. - From what I understand, Ron... you're a, uh--you're a numbers man. Yes, sir. l'm a financial consultant. l started out as a numbers man. ln fact, Ron, you remind me a lot of myself when l was a young man. We can always use more numbers men in the company. You know, it's overrun now with too many goddamn lawyers. No offense, Todd. After all, it is a family business. Well, uh, thank you, sir. lt's a very generous offer. No, no, no. Abe. You call me Abe. Looks like you need a refill. Todd! - Yes, sir? - Let's go find that bottle of yours, huh? - Take care of that, would you? - [ Hisses ] So, Ron, have you heard the one about the horny jockey and the Venezuelan stable boy? [ Ron Laughs ] No, but it sounds painful. lt's been a great couple of months... and l can honestly say that you are the best two interns... we have ever had here. Unfortunately, we can only hire one of you. So... let the best intern win! [ Crowd Cheering, Hooting ] [ Bell Rings ] Get in there, Maxie! Get in there! Get angry! Get angry! [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - Oh, that's not good. - [ Grunting ] - Y'ello. - Ronny, it's Todd. Oh, hey, Todd. What-What's goin' on? Oh,just a little thing called your bachelor party. So what's the game plan? l, uh, don't know. My buddies are big fans of''Two-for-Tuesday'' lap dances at Spanky's. Listen, Ron, this is your last hurrah. We gotta do this thing in style. Thinkin' we fly somewhere warm, hmm? Where the drinks have umbrellas, the hotels are five stars... the vagina flows like water-- Sweet, sticky water. Wow. That sounds great, but some of the guys are on tight budgets. That's what the company card's for, right? l mean, like Abe said, this is a family business. Look, that is very generous of you, but l can't let you pay for all that. Look, l'm really happy that you're marrying Mel. l mean, l always wanted a brother... but unfortunately my mother died when l was pretty young. Look, l know we're not blood or anything... but, look, l would be honored if you would let me... throw my new brother his bachelor party. Well-- Of course, Todd. Yeah. Absolutely. Awesome. Now listen, you probably want to get some sleep, bro-ham... 'cause you're gonna need it. Wow, Todd, l-- l'm so sorry about your mom. l never knew. Billy, are you fucking retarded? She's not dead. She's in Phoenix... with her second husband and her third set of tits. - l'm sorry. - Yeah. Yeah, you are. Now, look. l need recon on this guy. Ron Simmons. l wanna know everything about him-- every little detail. Every man has his weakness, Billy, and l wanna know his. The old man's steppin'down soon. I'm next in line. l haven't been sleeping with this cow of a daughter for the last three years... just so Daddy's little favorite can come in and take it from me. Uh-uh. Mmm. Sadly, Billy... l just don't think this little union's gonna make it to the altar. Mmm. - [ Horn Honking ] - Let's go! l'm still sober. Come on, man. The chicks in South Beach aren't gonna fuck themselves. - Hey, Mel. - Hey, boys. l love you, baby doll. See you soon. Mmm. Hey-- Oh! [ Chuckling ] What's that for? Well, you gotta buy the groom a lap dance. Pick a hottie. See? That's why l'm marrying you. - [ Tires Screeching ] - Oh, shit. It's my first wife. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go! - Love you. - Go, go, go. Come on, go! [ Tires Screeching ] Nice try, asshole. lt's your weekend with your son. Remember? Hey, it's Ron's bachelor party. That is your problem, shit for brains. Ron, congratulations. Oh! Marriage is a beautiful thing... and l am so very happy for you. Ass wipe. Thanks, lrene. l'm sorry you're not gonna be able to make it. That sucks. Get in the van, Ron. Tick-tock, tick-tock. JJ [ Headphones: Rock ] All right, l'm goin', okay? My life knows no joy. All l know is work and alimony payments and babysitting. So if you think l'm missing out on a weekend... of drunken debauchery, you're sadly mistaken. Well, he can't come with. This is a bachelor party, not Romper Room. - Ron? - Ron? - Ron? - [Jet Engine Whining ] Wait a minute. This? This is your future father-in-law's plane, man? Way to go, Federline. - And this Todd guy, he's gonna pay for the whole weekend? - Yeah, l guess so. - [ Laughs ] - Sounds gay to me, man. Yeah, we don't have to put out, do we? Yeah, l'm not sleepin' with your brother-in-law, Ron. JJ [ Radio: Hip-hop ] - [ Tires Screech ] - What a douche. My niggas! Huh? What about this? So, uh, guys, this is Todd. Todd, the guys. Gentlemen. Let's do this. - [ Derek ] Nice sweater. l guess purple's coming back. - Shotgun. Whoa. What's with the kid? - Oh, don't worry. He's the mature one. - Perfect. [ Laughs ] - Uh-- - [ Chuckling ] Oh, man. - What? What? - Okay, okay, listen, guys. Take your sea-- Why don't you have any pants on? What, this is a private plane, right? Them's my privates. - [ Laughs ] - [ Derek ] Eww. Anyway, look. Couple of flight attendants are gonna come out. Go over some safety precautions. lt's not a big deal. - Great. - Oh, ladies? - Hello, boys. l'm Mandy. - And l'm Sandy. And l'm in the upright and locked position. Yeah! [ Laughs ] We'll be serving you all the way to sunny Florida. And l got two million airline miles. Yeah! Hey, Derek. Offspring. Aw, geez. Hold on. Come on, ''Melvoid.'' Let's go. Dad, it's Tommy, dumb ass. Go see Captain Larry in the cockpit. - l don't wanna go to the cockpit. - Captain Larry. Don't forget to wipe your ass. ln the event of a water landing... you will find several flotation devices... on board the aircraft. [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Talk to me, Billy. l've checked you into the suite and made sure the bar is fully stocked. - What about decorations for the room? - l'm taking care of that now. [ Chattering ] [ Tommy ] Guys, come on. Let me out. [ Laughs ] Oh. [ Derek Muttering ] You, sir, know how to travel. Well, nothing is too good for my new bro. - All right. - Mmm. Speakin' of which, have you ever had two girls at once? Uh, actually, sadly, no. But, uh, have you? Of course, or else l wouldn't be married. Listen. l cannot let my new brother get married till he has had a hat trick... and l happen to have it on very good authority... that Sandy and Mandy are, mmm, morally flexible. [ Laughs ] And l love that about them. I do, but, uh-- l don't know, l think this weekend... l just wanna hang out with you guys... and get drunk and maybe crap my pants. - You know. l'm a traditionalist. - Okay. You know what? l'm gonna let this little Boy Scout routine fly for right now. - [ Laughs ] - Let me tell you something. My motto in business and in life... is ''balls to the wall.'' Now, the mark of a good bachelor party... is the bachelor getting laid early and often. And the Todd only throws the best bachelor parties. Ladies, do your worst. Guys, I'm-I'm fine. I really don't want a lap dance now. I'm fine. - [ Both Giggling ] - Whoa. Wait. Can l just--A little Purell first? Like, two-two squirts, please? Shut it, germ boy. [ Screams ] Oh, dear God! - [ Mandy ] Bye. - Okay. All right. Thank you, ladies. Yeah! [ Laughs ] Drained it. [ Derek ] See you on the lnternet. [ Laughs ] [ Mandy ] See you on the way back. See ya. Thanks. Whoa. - [ Thuds ] - [ Whimpers ] [ Groans ] - All right? - Way to go. One minute in Miami and two broken arms. That's our Seth. All right, gentlemen. Gentlemen, listen up. This is Billy. He's gonna be helping us out with the, uh, festivities this weekend. - What's up? - Let's check it out. Come on. Left, right. - Welcome to the presidential suite. - Wow. Ha, ha! Oh, my God. They're really letting me in this place? [ Laughing ] Oh, look at this. Whoo! Dip my balls in champagne, 'cause l'm in heaven. Groovy, Todd. Damn, Ron, l might just bang your brother-in-law after all, man. Oh, well, thanks for that image. [ Laughs ] Geez. - You good over there, Seth? - Yes. All right, pal. This place is amazing. - Thank you. - Aw, nothin' but the best. Now, there is one more stop on the tour. [ Chuckling ] Yeah. - [ Chattering ] - Gentlemen, say hello to my little friends. [ Giggling ] - Guten Tag. - Hello. Guten Tag. JJ [ Singing ln German ] Eins! Zwei! Drei! Whoo! [ With German Accent ] Long live Hitler! [ Groans ] Just gonna-- l'm gonna hit the head. [ Ron ] What are you trying to do, kill me? - [ No Audible Dialogue ] - [ Chattering ] - Hey. - Move. - So what do we got? - All right, so-- - There's a camera in every single room. - Perfect. lf this guy so much as pops a stiffy, we're gonna get it on tape. l'm telling you, that German chick said something about Hitler. My German's a little rusty, but l am pretty sure that she said... ''Long live Hitler.'' Seth? Relax, pal. Get a massage. l'm serious, okay? As the onlyJew here, all right... l feel it is my responsibility to be concerned... that our roommates might be Nazis. All right, buddy, l'll tell you what. lf they even think about invading Poland, we'll let somebody know. All right, Ronny. Gin and tonic time, buddy. Oh, fire it up. Ahhh. Will you just drop it, please? Hey, l'm cool with your sexuality, D. lt's just, l don't swing that way, man. Look. Asking you to rub sunblock on my back does not make you gay. Seriously. You might as well have asked me for a hand job. - Okay, that is just sick. - Hey. l smell cocktail wieners. What? Eureka. - Okay. - What are you doing? You don't even know what the S.A.A. is. lt's Sales Associates of America or some crap. Just, you know, talk about selling and goal realization... and all that other Tony Robbins shit. Why am l Tubbs? Because you, sir, are no Crockett. [ Clicks Tongue ] To be honest with you, l was a bit nervous coming here. When we first proposed a Sex Addicts Anonymous retreat, people rolled their eyes. - The were, like, ''Why not just call it an orgy?'' - Ooh. Oh, no, you'll see. These retreats offer a very supportive environment... where we can focus on healing and getting on the road to recovery. This weekend, sex will be the farthest thing from your mind. [ Chattering ] l can't get enough of that-- - You like guns, Pop? - What is that? The best day of my life was the day they gave me my 1 0-year chip. Oh, welcome. l'm Sue Hoover, president of the Southeast chapter. Oh, nice to meet you, Sue-- All of you. So what chapter are you from, Tubbs? ls that your first name? - Uh-- - Actually, that's his last name. Yeah, l'm Sonny and that's my partner Rico. Yeah. And we're from the Midwest chapter. - Welcome, Sonny and Rico. - Yeah. So, how long have you two been in the program? - Oh, not very. - Well, speak for yourself, Rico... 'cause I've been a member for, oh, gosh, like, 20 years. - Twenty years? My goodness. - Yeah. - Wow. - Yeah, l got started really young. - My grandpa, he was a member, so he started teaching me early. - [ Coughs ] Oh, careful there, Suzy Q. Those things are a little tricky. You gotta be careful. Yeah, you know, between my grandpa and the Boy Scouts... - it was like l was just born to be in S.A.A. - The Boy Scouts? Oh, yeah. l did a lot of hustling in the Scouts. Yeah, with the Christmas tree lot in the winter... and then goin' door to door in the summertime--whatever it took. - My scoutmaster even said l was the best he ever had. - [ Coughs ] - l'm fine. - Are you all right? Okay, let's not bore the nice people... with faded childhood glories there, Sonny. - Hey, Rico, isn't that your kid over there? - Hmm? Not a lot of women are comfortable with a male ''vaginacologist''... but l have many, many satisfied patients. - I am booking appointments. - Come on. - So, uh, Betty. - Hmm? You wanna maybe grab a drink later? You know, talk shop? l could always use some pointers on my technique. Okay? [ Chuckles ] Man. - l need to call my sponsor. - Mm-hmm. [ Todd ] Guys, let's go! The stripper's aren't getting any younger. - Sonny! Sonny! - Hey! Betty, what's--what's goin' on? Nothing. l just really enjoyed talking with you earlier. Oh, well, th-that's cool. Yeah. [ Chuckles ] Maybe, uh-- Maybe we should hang out, you know? - Grab a pizza, fuck? - [ Laughs ] l thought you'd never ask. - Pardon? - Well, l don't eat pizza, but whatever. Gentlemen, l will see you later. [ Laughing ] That line has never worked. l mean, ever. l'm gonna be really pissed if she doesn't murder him... or at least harvest a kidney, man. [ Chattering ] Ugh! That-That pole's gotta be covered in crabs and herpes... and God knows what. l am so glad l cashed in my 401 (k), man. - [ Groans ] - Gentlemen, this booth's us. Come on. - [ No Audible Dialogue ] - Excuse me, ladies. l hate to interrupt this meeting of the minds, but l got a work question. Who wants to make $1 0,000 for five minutes of work? Oh-- Back, back. Yeah. There it is. There it is. - Aaah! - Yeah! Get into position. Oh! The conquering hero has returned. [ Laughing ] Yeah. - Hey, that didn't take long, man. - Trust me, dude. She couldn't take much more. l fucking killed it-- Ninja style. - Oh, yeah? What, like fast and silent? - You know it, brother. Yeah. Hoo. Check it out. That chick's a dead ringer for a young Nancy Reagan. - [ Seth ] So? - l always wanted to fuck Nancy Reagan. Yeah! [ Seth ] I was always fond of Geraldine Ferraro. - Very sexy. - Come on, bachelor. You've got a date in the V.l.P. room. Go to the V.l.P.-- Oh, my God. Whoa. Hey! Whoa! You're--You're very nimble. Shh. Save your energy. You're gonna need it. Oh. [ Laughs ] Oh, wow. I've gotta get married more often. Uh-- Hey. Hey. Maybe the belt should stay buckled though. No? Robin! Your mommy's on the phone. - Your grandma had a heart attack. - Nana? Uh-huh. Oh, my God. That's horrible. l-- - You're not going anywhere, baby. - Hey. Hey--Ah! [ Moaning ] Okay. Hey. Hey--That's a zipper. - That's happening now. - Hey, back off! - He's mine. - You can share. What? What? Oh! Oh, Lord. - Maybe we've had enough. That's my leg. - You fucking bitch! [ Both Shouting ] [ Screams ] [ Whimpers, Screams ] Holy shit. Come on, guys. - [ Ron Groaning ] - Get the hell off of him. - [ Moans ] - Hey! [ Groans ] [ Yelling ] [ Laughing ] Yeah! Stripper fight! - [ Groans ] - Get off! Get off! - [ Screaming ] - [ Screams ] [ Screaming ] What is Todd's deal? ls he trying to get me laid or get me killed? - Hey, man, there are worse ways to die. - Yeah. Dudes, that chick in the corner... is throwing me signals like she's Johnny fuckin' Bench. She's paying more attention... to the floating lint than you, dude. All right, let's get down to brass tacks, okay? - Are you ready for marriage, Ron? - l think so. Yeah. Oh. So you're ready to say good-bye to blow jobs? 'Cause that's the first thing that goes. Married women don't give blowjobs. It's a union thing, man. And then your sports that you love... that's the next thing you can kiss good-bye. - Mel likes sports. - No, no, no. They pretend they like sports... the same way we pretend we like talkin' to them. The only sports you're gonna get when you're married... is Little League T-Ball. And l've seen that stuff, and trust me, Ron. Most of those kids really fuckin' suck, okay? And by the time they take away the last thing... that gives you any pleasure at all-- booze-- you've forgotten what happiness is. So now you're just walking around... an empty shell of the man you once were. And that's when they leave you, Ron. Hmm. Claimin' that ''You're not the man l married.'' Well, no shit, hey? Thanks for playin', and here's a parting gift. Child support and alimony right up the ass! And... that's marriage, Ron. You ready for that? - l'm gonna go pee. - Mmm. - Yeah? - Yeah. l need some pills. [ Groans ] - Oh, for God's sakes. Let me help you with that. - Oh, thanks. Just don't get any ideas. l'm not gonna wipe your ass later. Ooh. My old friend codeine. - Nice. Two for me, one for you? - No, no, no. - l need that stuff, man. - Wait a minute. - Can you drink with those? - lt's way better when you drink. One beer is not gonna be a problem. Aw, come on, man. Marriage is outdated, Ron. We don't need 'em. Yeah, we never should have, uh, given women the right to vote. Okay, that's it. Let's take it easy, shall we? - lt's been kind of a long night, what with the gang rape and all. - [ Snoring ] Oh, God. l'm gonna walk Sleeping Beauty back up to his room. - Come on. - Okay. l gotta go to the garden party. - Okay, careful. Careful. - [ lndistinct ] Okay. That's good for you. You guys, uh-- You guys comin', or what? No, l think l'm gonna stay here, man. That chick over there is beggin' me for it. - [ No Audible Dialogue ] - l'm not gonna miss this. Why would you? Seth? [ Groans ] - Hi. [ Chuckles ] - Hi. He's, uh-- He's had kind of a long day. - lt's definitely past someone's bedtime. - Yeah. - Sorry about that. Come on, pal. - [ Seth Mumbles ] Here you go. Oh, geez. [ Laughs ] So, uh, do you wanna take a picture... or should l give you a piece of paper so you can sketch them? - Take a picture. - Oh, no. l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l'm from Cleveland, and l was noticing your shirt. - Are you a Browns fan? - My father is from Cleveland, so l was brainwashed early. l'm a Cavs fan, but they're breaking my heart right now. - [ Man On TV, Indistinct ] - Aw, come on, LeBron. - Shoot less commercials and more free throws. - [ Seth ] Come on, LeBron. - So you're--you're a big Cleveland fan, huh? - Such is my curse. - Well, uh-- - [ Snoring ] He's drooling on me now... so l should probably go, but it was nice meeting you. - [ Laughing ] You too. - All right.
