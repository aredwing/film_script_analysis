Woke up on a summer day The birds above come out to play They're chirping outside my window La da da da The sun is shining in the sky I think I know the reason why And it's okay It's so fine Everything will be just fine It's time to shine It's a beautiful day It's a beautiful day Won't let anything in the way No more rain No more clouds No more doubt It's a beautiful day It's a beautiful day Won't let anything in the way No more rain No more clouds No more pain No more frowns It's a beautiful day Andrei, door. Sure, sure. Hmm... Mrs. Crosby. Eating again? - Hello, Coco. - Good morning. - Good morning, Mrs. Harper. - Hi, Andrei. Your husband was out of here early. - Hmm. Such is the life of a surgeon. - Yes, indeed. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. It's a beautiful day It's a beautiful day Won't let anything in the way No more rain No more clouds No more doubt It's a beautiful day It's a beautiful day Won't let anything in the way It's a beautiful day Oh, my. What's the weight limit for Spandex? 120, tops. - Come on, Desiree! - Whoo! Whoops! You call that a punch? You're hitting like a girlie girl. Come on, Desiree! Come on! Neutralize your opponent! Oh! Oh. Sorry. I love it. Lunch at one? Absolutely! Cheers. So, Lana, tell us about Rudolpho. Mm. It's Renaldo. And I just found out he has a wife and three kids back in Argentina. Who cares as long as his family stays over there, right? I'd care. Oh, my gosh, it's Dr. Fisher, best surgeon in town. Ah! Dr. Fisher! Hi! Cheers. Bye-bye. Oh, Mrs. Harper! - Let me get your bag. - Thank you, Andrei. Oh, they're heavy. How are you? Ah, you should see the summer collection at Coccinelle. Really. I can't wait. Mm, blinis and caviar for me. Hummus and carrots for him. Dr. Harper's office. - Hi, Linda. - Hi, Desiree. So is my husband on his way home? Uh, didn't he text you? No, no, no, I didn't get his text. He had a last-minute surgery. He has a last-minute surgery? - It was a bunion flare-up. - Tonight? Yes, tonight. Would you like me to leave a message? Oh. Uh, no, no, um... no message. All right. Thanks. Happy Anniversary, Wade. You all right? Do I look all right? You know, Desiree, you shouldn't consume so much dairy. Oh, really, Doctor? Who spiked your prune juice? Well, let me see. Maybe it's the Cristal that I had, by myself, on our anniversary. Our anniversary? How could you forget? Desiree... I'm leaving you. What? I'm in love with my acupuncturist. You've been getting acupuncture? - Yes. - But... you hate pain. It isn't really painful. It's quite relaxing, actually. She's very gentle. I don't care if she puts you into a tantric coma! I meant to tell you sooner. - Sooner? - We've been seeing each other for eight months. Well, that's very sneaky of you. What's her name? Olive. Olive. Like... the cocktail condiment? How old is she? I can see that you're not taking this very well. How old is she, Wade? Twenty. Just stop before things get any worse! "Worse?" How could things get any worse? Wade wants a divorce, and you don't get a dime. How is that possible? It's possible because you, against my vehement protests, signed a pre-nup, which is the nastiest, most malignant piece of one-sided schlock ever been drafted on the island of Manhattan. Thank you, Eddie. That makes me feel so much better. Anything else? Well, yeah. He's also filed a restraining order against you. - What? - Apparently, you turned into some kind of crazed ninja and tried to strangle him over his Grape Nuts. It was All Bran. Who cares? It's a nutty thing to do. And I didn't strangle him. Much. I don't even know you anymore, Desiree. Whatever happened to that sweet little Jersey girl that I kissed in the boys' bathroom back at Flemville Elementary? Oh, for goodness sakes, Eddie! We were twelve! You're supposed to be my lawyer. Do something! I'm trying. Okay? I'm in the process of negotiating the retrieval of your personal belongings from your former dwelling in the presence of a law enforcement officer. "Former dwelling?" Yeah. You gotta surrender your keys to the penthouse. What? And the ring. No! Let go. How am I supposed to sustain myself? Have you forgotten that your parents practically hocked the family business to send you to Columbia? Maybe it's time to dust off that MBA of yours. Perfect. I can just hear the interview now. "Oh, what kind of work experience have you acquired over the last 15 years Mrs. Harper?" "Well, none, but I am quite an accomplished shopper. " You have a place to stay? Crash on my couch. Thanks, but my girlfriends will be fighting over me. - Morgan. - What's going on? - You heard? - Unbelievable. Oh, yes! Listen... We were just leaving for the country house. You're going to the Hamptons? That's perfect! I can watch your penthouse while you're gone. The building doesn't allow strangers in the apartment. But surely your husband would trust me. How's Wade's throat? Oh. Uh, Wade's throat is fine. So he's not pressing charges? No, he's not pressing charges. - Hi, Lana. You got my message? - Uh-huh. - So I can stay with you? - No, honey, I'm with Fabio. - Who's Fabio? - You know, the one from Spain. Oh. Well, that's no problem. You won't even know I'm there. He cooks in the nude. Oh. That would be awkward. Sasha? I'm desperate. All I'm asking is to sleep in your maid's room. That's Fluffy's room. I don't care if your cat's in there. I love Fluffy. He's so sensitive. Any little change, he stops eating. Listen, missy. Who nursed you through your last eye job? I can't believe you just said that! Are you blackmailing me? No, I am not trying to blackmail you! I would never! - Well, it sounded like it to me. - Oh, come... Hello? Hello? Out of the road! Get back! Watch it! Ohh! Oh! Ah! Oh! May I help you? I'd like a room, please. Do you have a reservation? No, this is an involuntary visit. I'm afraid we're sold out. Can you... Can you please... Can you please check? Just in case. All right, but I'm absolutely certain. Please. Ah! Mr. Pitbull just canceled. - Oh! - So the Imperial Suite is available at $3,250... per night. Sold! Oh, you have no idea what a horrible day I've had. What I need is a new pair of shoes, a hot bath, and a Porterhouse steak. I'm terribly sorry. Your card has been declined. That's impossible. It has no credit limit. Please, try again. Oh. Yes, right away. W-What are you doing? I have been instructed to destroy your card. You know, good luck. It's made out of titanium. I don't suppose you'd comp me a room. No! I didn't think so. How 'bout your place? Hey! I was joking! He's not even my type! I am calling the credit card complaint department. You are all in big trouble! Oh, no. Daddy. I'm so happy to see you. It's been a long time. I forgot to pay that nice cab driver. Don't worry about that. He hit you. I don't think they charge for that. I remember. I was making a call. Did you see my phone? I don't think it made it. But I can't live without it. You'd be amazed at what we can live without. You may get sleepy, darling. The doctor gave you an anti-anxiety agent. Really? I'm feeling quite alert. You go ahead and rest, sweetheart. You'll be as good as new tomorrow. I'm so happy you're home. I missed you. Breakfast is ready! Oh... Oh! Ah! Daddy? - Daddy! - Good morning, sweetheart. How you feeling? A little stiff, but okay, I guess. Sit, sit, sit, sit. There you go. What's wrong? You made me pancakes and Jimmy Dean sausages! That's your favorite. This breakfast is five zillion calories! Well, don't you want it? No, I do. That's the problem. Daddy, I have something to tell you. I know. Eddie told me about Dick. It's not Dick. That was my college boyfriend. My husband's name is Wade, remember? Well, whatever. If your mother was still alive... God rest her soul... there's no telling what she would've called him. I don't understand why Wade would do this to me. I was a good wife. You warned me not to marry him, but now look at me. Now I'm just a discarded woman, like somebody's disposable razor! Here, drink some juice. Why aren't you listening to me? I am, I am. I'm listening, I'm listening. I'm letting you vent. Darling, everything's gonna be all right. Believe me. How am I going to support myself? I don't even have a skill. You have a perfectly good skill. Baking. There you are. Make you feel better. Making bread? It's not just bread. - It's the staff of life. - Of life. I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. P. My mother, she had a... Oh. Hello. - Dino, this is my daughter. - Hi. Desiree. Dino Ravettino. Boy, Paddy talks a lot about you. All good. Hey, Mr. P, I'm thinking about trying out a new coffee. It's called "cinnamon swirl. " It sounds good. I'll brew some up. Nice to meet you. You, too. - He's new. - He's big. But surprisingly nimble in the kitchen. - Good morning. - Hey, Moe. Good morning, Francine. Morning, Paddy. Hey, Moe! How does it go? Morning, Paddy. - Hi, Edna. - Paddy, I'm so glad you finally hired some help. Oh. Did she just call me the help? This is Desiree, my daughter. Oh. The one who married that famous, rich doctor from Manhattan? How about a loaf of Irish soda bread? - It's hot out of the oven. - Okay, sure. Hey, boss, I got an order ready for delivery. Is Reggie here yet? No, he's not here yet. - Oh. - I read about your husband in OK Magazine. Did he really do Britney Spears' surgery? Excuse me? Her toe tuck. - No. - Her husband is the cosmetic foot doctor to the stars. He specializes in toe-besity. So, when's he coming to Flemington so we can meet him? Never. He dumped her. Uh, sorry. Dad! Can I help you? My name's Calvin. I'm Reggie's brother. - Where's Reggie? - He's at jury duty. He sent me to make his deliveries for him. Fine. Where's your car? Man, I don't have one. I'm only fifteen. Oh, shoot. - Watch the head. - Doh! - All right, you in? - Dino's in. Nope! He's not in, Dad. Oh... Is Francine okay with this? - She's fine. - Looks a little tight. I don't want to break her steering wheel. All right. Dino out. - Oh! Ow... - Oh! All right, easy, now. Desiree in. - What? - You're in. No, I'm from Manhattan. We don't drive. Of course you do. I taught you. Well, that was two decades ago. Well, you're all we've got. I'm too old, he's too big, and he's too young. Please. Look, it's just like riding a bicycle. You get a few blocks, and it all comes back to you. Uh, the brake's in the middle. Go. Okay. I can do this. I can do this. Okay, I can do this. You're doin' great, honey! Keep it up! - You're beautiful! - Go! Go, go! Ah, she's a real sport, Paddy. Yeah. Just like her mother. Come on, you piece of... Hi. Paddy's Bakery. - Got it. - Okay. Thank you. Thanks. Hi! Delivery from Paddy's Bakery. Thank you so much. Thank you. Look at your car! Auberge Benoit. Auberge Benoit. Sign. A sign. I ain't got a lot of money But I want you to know, honey I still got a good life to lead This is outrageous. A piece of paradise in Flemington, New Jersey. Hey. Hey, that's my life! I want it back! Aah! Shoot! Shoot, shoot, shoot! Hi there. Hi. You saw that, didn't you? Yep. - I, uh-I should probably tell somebody. Right? - Nah. No? I don't know. Do birds really need two stories? Oh... Well, uh... Hate to hit and run, but, uh, do you know where I can leave this bread? - I'll take it. - Oh, great. Here. Okay. I got it. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Well. So you're the new delivery girl? No, no, I am not the new delivery girl. I'm, uh-I... Never mind. Okay. I will let you get back to your gardening. Sorry. I'll take those, boss. Thank you. Hi. Hello. - You must be Francine. - Desiree! I feel like I know you already. Hi. Paddy must be thrilled to have you home. Yeah. But you're not? Oh, I just wish home wasn't in New Jersey. Oh. Well... I suppose Flemington is a little different than what you're used to. Just a little. Oh, I brought you your keys. Thank you for letting us use your car. You're welcome. Anytime. Okay. So... How's it going, Calvin? It's going a'ight. Thanks. I love this game. I love it, I love it. Oh, hey, Desiree. Nice to see you. Thanks, Moe. I see you got back alive. Yeah, but I think I might have killed the Mini Cooper. Uh-oh. Mr. P, Francine would forgive you anything, if you know what I mean. Huh. What's he talking about? Uh, nothing! Big mouth. - Sorry, boss. - Hit me. So who's minding the store, guys? Why? Do we have a customer? - No. - Hey. Eddie called. Sounded important. Okay. Full house! - Full house. - Oh... You owe me two haircuts, and you owe me spaghetti. I'm gonna get you next time. So, does that work for you two? - Eddie, that works for me. - Great. Okay. I'll get the papers over to your office. - Dougie. - Good to see you. - Marina. - Ah. Thank you. - See you soon. - Come on, honey. Eddie Rubinsky. Eddie! Were you trying to reach me? Desiree, I got good news. Oh. I can move back into my penthouse? No. Help me, Eddie. I can't live here. Okay, well, listen. I talked Wade into dropping the restraining order, and they've scheduled a meeting with you tomorrow at his lawyer's office. With me? Oh, that's good. That's-I mean... That's good, right? Yeah. If you manage to control yourself, you'll get your clothes back. Aha! Hallelujah! Eddie, I gotta call you back. Yeah, but, De- Hi, Calvin. Hey. - Everything all right? - Yeah, this drawer just sprung when I was trying to clean up and all. - It just popped open. - Well, that's not good. No, ma'am, it's not. You worked hard here today. The place looks nice. Thanks. Is your brother gonna be coming back tomorrow? Nah. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. Do you think maybe Paddy would let me fill in for him? I can make deliveries before school and come back at 3:00. I could do that for y'all, if you want. Plus, m-m-my family could really use the money. I think my dad would be okay with that. Yeah? Thanks. - See you tomorrow. - Yeah. - Later, Mr. P. - Good night, Calvin. Hey, Dad, about Calvin... - Oh, yeah, he's a good kid, isn't he? - Yeah, I like him. Whoa! Paddy, we gotta call that guy to fix the register. It's popping open again. Desiree, he lost the last hand, so Dino has to cook dinner. You're in luck. You know I make a mean meatball. Hmm? Oh, yeah, I know. What game's playing? The Sox. The Red Sox and the Yankees. - You got a bet on 'em? - No betting. I already owe you a spaghetti. Oh, it's hit deep to center! It's going, it's going, it's gone! Let's get up and move Dad! - Morning. - Morning. I just killed my blow dryer. Your what? How am I supposed to straighten my hair? Have you seen the dress I was wearing when I got here? I washed it for you. Here it is, hot out of the dryer. - The dryer? - Yeah. Oops. Oh, no, no! My Missoni! Maybe we could wet it, you know, and stretch it back out. It's not a sea monkey! It doesn't expand when you add water! What am I gonna do now? I have a meeting with Wade in two hours, and I have nothing to wear! Don't be ridiculous. You got a whole closet full of clothes. Oh! I know you think I'm falling apart But you rock my heart Girl, you rock my heart I know I should be ready to go But you rock my heart You keep on rockin' my heart Just imagine We could make up and start our life over This time I would hold you in my arms Till the stars melted into the ocean But I'll promise I'll never look up - Desiree? - Ohh... Lana. Wow. I almost didn't recognize you. What happened? Retro. Okay. Well, can I just say the '80s have come and gone. Twice. I was just in a meeting with my business manager, and he was telling me all this drama. Is it true? You and Wade are really getting divorced? I don't know. It's a nightmare. - I could use a lunch with the girls. - Sure, honey. Where are you staying? The St. Regis? New Jersey. What? I had nowhere else to go. Remember? Oh, yeah. This whole situation has gotten really tricky, 'cause Wade and I run in the same social circles, and he's a member of my country club and, you know, but it's like I've really got to run 'cause I'm late for my, uh, my facial. So, bye. So, lunch this weekend? Sure. Yeah. We'll call you. Bye. Hi. How can I help you? Desiree? Oh. Hi, Wade. You look... different. Are you all right? Sort of. I've regained my sanity since the last time I saw you. Oh. Sorry about the tie grabbing. No. It was completely my fault. Actually, I'm really pleased that we had a chance to meet before we go in. I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am and that I really hope- Wade. Sorry to keep you waiting. Saul Blinderman. This is my junior associate, Nicole Hoffman. This way, please. Uh, but my lawyer isn't here yet. The receptionist will show him in. This meeting should be brief since there is a clear-cut prenuptial agreement which was signed willingly by both- I'm sorry I'm late. Ah. Eddie, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. I had a little cracked tooth back here. The dentist gave me a little something. I feel much better now. You change your hair? Mr. Rubinsky, may we continue, please? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. The prenuptial agreement clearly states that Mrs. Harper is only entitled to the monetary sum and personal belongings that she entered into the marriage with. But it precludes the creation of any community property after the marriage began- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bla bla bla. Excuse me? Eddie... Get it together. We need to reschedule this for another time. That doesn't work for us. Mr. Harper would like to conclude this as quickly as possible. I don't understand. What's the big rush? Olive is pregnant. That was exhilarating! Exhilarating? Are you cracked? My husband is pregnant with another woman! Hi. That's right! Yeah, it's bad. But it's good for you in a whole new monetary way. - Are you kidding? - Oh! What? What? Desi, hey! Desi! What's the problem? Oh, Giorgio! Jimmy! Louis. Oh! I hate to break it to you, but we're moving to Jersey. Damn! Hmph! What? Nothin'. Those are cute, that's all. They are, aren't they? Vvvvv! Vvvvv! Sir, please don't touch that. I'm not touching it. That's what's so incomprehensible. See? Vvvvv! - Vvvvv! - Step away from the planet, sir! Vvvvv! It's a little snug. Oh, trust me, Tamika, once you lose the bulletproof vest and let out that side seam, it's fabulous. You think so? Are you sure? It never fit me right, anyway. Now for the shoes. Don't sit. Don't touch! Can I look? Eddie? Yeah? - You okay? - Yeah. I'm going. Me, too. Oh, Officer, if you ever need a lawyer, please, call me. Wow. It's time to go, ma'am. Bye. Thank you. You are gonna be fine. Yeah? This is your life. Get used to it. Hmm. Miss you, Mom. Let's bake. Dad's right. Baking does make you feel better. Holy moley! It's the Bride of Chucky. Uh! This isn't working! I am not a baker! My housekeeper buys my bread at Zabar's! Whoa. Would you look at that. Good morning. Morning! Morning, Calvin. I got wheels, Mr. P. I'm ready to roll. Ho! We saw. Very pink. That's my sister's, man! I want the fruity one. I pointed to it first. Where's Desiree? Changing. For three hours? Man, I need a spa day. How you feeling? Just fine. Can you wrap these cannolis? It's what I live for, Dino. There she is. - The one that left her husband? - No! He left her. He's a successful doctor. What a shame. She looks like such a nice girl. It's gonna be tough for a woman her age to find a new husband with that kind of annual income. Practically impossible. I can hear you. Maybe she should go on the Internet. My cousin's daughter found a nice rabbi on there. She'd be better off in a bar. Mm-hmm. Well, if I were her, I'd get on my hands and knees and beg that handsome doctor to please take her back. That's it! I am not going anywhere. You hear me? Not to a bar, not on the Internet, and, heaven forbid, not on my knees to beg my sneaky, cheating husband to take me back. So in case any of you missed the story of my life, yes, my husband is having a baby with his acupuncturist. No, I don't need a man for his annual income, and maybe, if God has any mercy, you will all get over it and find something else to talk about! I think she lost it. Uh... who's next? Me? What would you like? That was certainly different. You just managed to insult half of Paddy's best customers in one fell swoop. - Well, they deserved it. - Oh, maybe, but your father didn't. You know how happy he is to have you home now? He's really missed you. I know. I've missed him, too. I tried to get back to visit. It's been five years. You can't have tried very hard. But no matter. Paddy would give you the world if he could. And despite their misguided ways, those people in there just wanted to help you, too. It's what folk do around here. They help each other. And instead of being grateful, you strut around with your Fifth Avenue attitude and your lousy work ethic. If you just looked around you might realize that Paddy can't even afford the job he's given you. What? I had no idea. Because you didn't bother asking. Dad? Yeah? How are things going here? Oh, fine. Why? I was just going over your numbers, and- Here, try that. - Huh. - Mm! Um... It's not looking good. You do a decent business in the morning, but the rest of the day, it's absolutely dead. - What about that potato bread? - It's delicious. Needs a tad more sea salt. - You think so? - Yeah. Oh, maybe, maybe a touch. I'm talking about the future of Paddy's Bakery here. I keep tellin' him. We need to modernize. Don't I, Mr. P? I'm too old to be modern. Maybe we could put a little sitting area out front. We could jazz up the place a little bit. We could offer designer coffees. My cousin's got a used cappuccino machine he's selling. I could get it for a steal. - Perfect! - What y'all need to do is get some new tunes, man, for us young people. - Great idea. - Whoa. Wait a minute. I don't know about that. Come on, Daddy. I can make this work. Let me show you what I learned at that expensive university you paid for. I promise you, I won't steer you wrong. Oh. Oh, well, maybe. Well, all right. Yes! I got it. - Yes! - Yeah. - Delicious. - Ha ha! Whoo! Ow! Mm, one second. Oh! I broke a nail. I don't believe it! You want me to call someone? Oh. You again. Hi. Hi. We never formally met. I'm Benny. Benny. As in Benoit's. Oh, and you're the chef. Yes. And the owner? Yeah. Well, technically speaking, the place belongs to my family. My mother's French, my father's English. My mother's eccentric great-uncle decided to build a chateau in the middle of New Jersey. No one else in the family wanted to restore it, but I did, so here I am. In good old Flemington. I take it you prefer Manhattan. How do you know that? Well, it's a small town. Can I get you something? Uh, yeah, yeah. I just came to, um, settle my account for the month. Hmm. Would you like a receipt? Yes, please. That's a lot of baguettes. What I'd really like is your phone number. What? Oh, uh, hi, Benny. Hi, Paddy. So? I don't have a number. My phone was killed by a taxi in front of a five-star hotel, but even if I, if I... if I did, I am in a transitional state and emotionally unavailable at this time. Well, in that case, I'll just take the receipt. Au revoir. Yeah, I don't even know what that means. You can come out now. Yeah, well, we were just, uh... Just keep walking. - Let's go see what Moe's up to. - Keep walking. Yep, I'm walking. Walking. Wait a minute. Don't you have a good Irish jig or something- Oh. Little cakes! Hey. - Want to taste? - Oh, please. Wow. Mm. Mm. Whoa. Oh, oh, that's good. I taste real vanilla bean. - Yep. My mother's recipe. - Ah. But a mini version. Beautiful. Thank you. It was a Tuesday It was 'bout two weeks ago We went along a rocky flower-coated mountain road He spun me 'round so fast- Excuse me. Sorry about that. We're still working on our playlist. Well, I would take that one off. Yeah, I agree. How can I help you? You can tell me how to get back on the turnpike. I can. What do you think, Francine? I prefer Jay-Z. You'll see the entrance on the left. Thank you. You're a lifesaver. And take one of these for the road. To make up for the music assault. What a cute idea. They're new. I thought I'd call them paddycakes. Great name. Thank you. Great dress. Gaultier? You know your designers. It was a weakness of mine. Thanks again. Here we go. A little something by The Midnite Snacks. - It's nice, right? - Yeah. Uhhuh. Ah. Okay. Hey, come on. Yeah!

So, how's everything going at the bakery? Great, great. I hear you're selling cappuccinos now. Yeah. And, um, something called a paddycake? Uh-huh. I still can't call you, can I? - No. - I didn't think so. Uh-oh. - Uh-oh. - Paddy. Give me a hand, would ya? - It's stuck. - Oh, not again. This joint is jumpin'! You're gonna love it. Really good. Here you go. Tell me how you like it. Okay? It's all good stuff there. Flavor of the day is passion fruit. Few of those? Must be the music. Hey, Mr. Kerrigan. Hi, Eddie. Desiree, I am really sorry about botching the meeting with Wade. Hmm. Would you accept this free phone that I got with my rollover minutes as a peace offering? Yes. Thanks, Eddie. - Of course I forgive you. - Hey. Hey, guys. It's Friday night. So what are we all doing, huh? Come on, baby! Yes! Whoohoo! You still got it, Dad. Go on, Eddie.

When does Calvin get back? Who knows? Eddie! Oh, thank goodness. - We need your help. - How long has business been like this? Since today. Eddie, don't just stand there. Do something. Like what? Wash the pans. I don't do dishes! I make $600 an hour soaking rich people in Manhattan! Let me clear off these. I'll be right back. Well, hello, ladies. I'm not really a waiter. I'm actually rich and powerful. I live on Central Park West. See that Benz there? It's mine. Right. No? Okay. Looks good, looks good. There you go, June. Thank you. Everybody, I'm sorry. We're sold out. No! Okay, tomorrow, tomorrow. Please come back. Thank you, Joyce. I'll have a dozen for you, okay? Ah! Whew! Ah, we're closed. - Thank the Lord! - Man, that was crazy. You know, this has been the biggest day in the history of this bakery. Hi! Have you seen this? What's that? What's this? "Life Just Got Sweeter On The Other Side Of The River. " They're calling Paddy's Bakery "a little slice of nirvana. " Ooh, that's nice. It talks about you, too, Desiree. They love your paddycakes! Oh! - How did they find us? - Yeah. It's the Gaultier girl! We're famous! Thanks for coming out. You're welcome, kiddo. Would you mind dropping these off to Andrei, my old doorman? Sure. Don't worry. I'm gonna have you living back in the city in no time. Okay. Mwah! I got ideas. All right. - See you soon. - Drive safe. I will. Desiree, Benny called earlier. He did? He asked us out. He asked who out? All of us. Watch your step. You know, sometimes the cement will attack you! Hello, hello! Welcome to my humble abode! Ah, lovely to see you. Thank you, Francine. Thank you. Please. That's great. - I'll put this in the kitchen. - Thanks, Paddy. That's very kind of you. Thank you very much. - Make yourselves at home now. - Benny, how ya doin'? - Dino, good to see you. - Good to see you. - Thanks for coming. - I'll put this in the fridge. Thank you, thank you. You know where you're going. You shouldn't have. I should have. I'll put it somewhere safe. Come on. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. I didn't have your number, so I called your dad. This is my uncle's wine from Sicily. - Oh! - It's wonderful. - I have to try that. - Merci bien, Elena. - Smells so good. - Thank you, thank you. I hope you enjoy it. Um, to your very good health. It's really lovely to have you all here. It means a lot to me. Cheers. Thank you. Cheers. So much. Salute. Cheers. It's my pleasure. - Mm, fantastic. - Oh. Benny, this is probably the best chicken I've ever eaten in my whole life. Well, thank you, Paddy, but it's not chicken. It's not? It's frog's legs, Paddy. What the heck, ya know? As long as it doesn't hop off the plate. No, no, I disagree. Opera should only be sung in Italian. It's the most romantic language in the world, huh? Yeah, but the French, they sing the best love songs. Well, yeah, I think you're both crazy. 'Cause the best thing in the world is a good Irish jig. An Irish jig? I know how to settle this. Way, hey, and away, yah We'll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots We'll bunt up the sail with a fling, yah And pay Paddy Doyle for his boots Thank you for this. My father hasn't been on a date in seven years. It's my pleasure. Would you like a quick tour? - I'd love one. - Come on. Way, hey, and away, yah We'll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots Ah, yes, so the guests all stay up there, and, um, this is where I live. That's an elevator in there, but it doesn't work. Nice. And in there is the library. Lots of books. Books. I love books. You love books? I love books. Oh, that's my office in there, but it's a little disorganized. You don't want to look in that. Okay. How is it that you don't have a significant other? - Oh, I did have. She was French. - Oh. She hated New Jersey. In the end, she didn't care for me much either. Ah, French girls are tough. Brutal. - Oh, wow. - Yeah. Oh, that's my great uncle. Just ignore him. Okay. Perhaps we should continue the tour. Yes. - Uh, we have a problem. - What is it? We've run out of hallway. And they've stopped singing. Benny, come on down here! It's your turn now! Yeah! Come on! - Rain check? - Absolutely. - We need more coconut cream. - Already? Oh, wow! That's a good thing. Any calls? Nope. It's only been two days. It's too soon for Benny to call. Yeah, that would violate the three-day rule. Yeah, man. Women like it when you make them wait. I got a news flash for you men. The three-day rule is stupid. Women don't like it. It just makes us angry. I don't care what happens. Do not call Benny. I'm not. - Just relax. - Yeah, man, chill. I am the queen of chill! I could care less if Benny calls or not. Paddy's. I mean, Desiree here. I'm a genius. It's Eddie. Hi. Look, we're very busy here. What is it? I would love to buy you a hot dog. What? No, not you, Desiree. How 'bout a pretzel? Eddie, focus. - No... - Yo, what are you doin'? Come on! You're scaring off my customers! Give me one of those. - Look, I'm hanging up, Eddie. - Desiree, wait! Keep the change. I got you a Willy Wonka of a deal, and you're gonna love it! Zwieback International wants to franchise Paddy's Bakery. Are you serious? Yeah! They're going crazy over the whole paddycakes thing. We can talk about my commission later. We gotta move fast, while I got 'em salivating. Hang on. Daddy... Zwieback wants to franchise the bakery. They want to meet with us Friday. Great. Get me the flour, sweetheart. Did you hear me? Yeah, I heard you. Look, I'm not going to the big city. You go. Okay. We're on. Great. Oh, and, Desiree, they're gonna pick you up. Hey, Daddy, are you sure you're okay with me negotiating for you? Well, of course. It's just... It's your bakery, and this is a huge deal. Sweetheart, it's not my bakery. It's our bakery. Thank you for saying that. I just hope I don't mess it up. You won't. How do you know? Because you're a Kerrigan. Now, go get 'em, tiger. Desiree! Good luck, darlin'! "Saw the article. Us girls want to have drinks. " Ah! Perfect. "See you at 5." Look out, New York. I'm back. - Okay, they're ready for you. - All right. Hey, Benny must be pretty busy, huh? - He went to Paris. - Paris? It was an unexpected trip. Gabrielle had some sort of crisis. Have a safe flight. Uh, thanks. - Oh. - Mm. Marcus Kelly Macaroons. One of our franchises. So, Mrs. Harper... Please, call me Desiree. Of course. Desiree, we do things differently here at Zwieback International. Anyone can franchise a successful product, but can they capture the atmosphere of love and caring that has become the very essence of what Paddy's Bakery stands for? Picture this: The quintessential family bakery, established in 1892, bringing a little slice of home to the big city. We have a deal memo here for you to sign. James? I'm sure you'll find our offer more than satisfactory. In addition to the signing bonus, Desiree will have the title of co-executive director. Mm. With my father. Well, we would be happy to discuss a minimal involvement for him. Minimal? Well, Desiree, with all due respect, he is in his sunset years, and we are launching a new contemporary franchise. Yeah, we really want to push the envelope on this one. And push my father out in the process? Well, we'd keep him on for the first few months. - A few months? - Whoa, whoa, come on. Yeah, wait, wait, wait. What happened here? Just a minute ago, you had us picturing Paddy's Bakery as a snug, cozy little slice of home. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but the twist is there's no room for dad. May I suggest you have another look at the offer. Don't look at it. I'm sure your father would be happy retiring in sunny Florida with a big fat check. See, that's where you're wrong. Because your greedy gluttonous muffins will come and go, but my father is Paddy's Bakery, and he is very happy working in Flemington. So what does this mean? Desiree? Sorry, gentlemen, but we have no deal. Rule! I'm just gonna take these. Desiree, I can't believe I'm saying this, but you did the right thing. Thanks, Eddie. Hi. - Hey. - Hello there. No, no, no, no. Excuse me. We ordered Bellinis. That is champagne with white peaches, not yellow. Don't think he understood me. Sorry, Desiree. This place has really gone to the natives. So are you on your way? I don't think I can make it. What happened? I thought you were staying in town to shop for apartments? You know, suddenly I've changed my mind. Why? Because I don't fit in here anymore. And you know what? I don't want to. Goodbye. So, now what? I'm going home. Benny. Watch your head, ma'am. This way. Wade? I had to see you. How did you know I was here? I called the bakery. Desiree. I'm sorry. Olive dumped you, didn't she? - Yeah. - Ha! And a baby on the way? - A false alarm. - Oh, big surprise there. I know I screwed up, but just give us a second chance. We can have a beautiful life together. We had a beautiful life together, Wade. It wasn't enough for you. When did you get this? I had a momentary midlife crisis. It won't happen again. But isn't it gorgeous? Come on. Now, let me take you back home. To Manhattan, where you belong. Things have changed for me now, Wade. All right. At least let me drive you to the bakery. Come on. All right. You're gonna love it. Hmm? That's it. You'll see, Desiree. I'm not the selfish idiot I used to be. I've changed. Son of- I didn't see you coming. I'm so sorry. You better be, big boy. That's a $285,000 Ferrari! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, okay. - Wade! What are doing? Leave Benny alone! - You know this idiot? - Yes! - Hi. - Hi. How is Gabrielle? My mother? She's fine now. Hello? Do I look like I care? - Did you say your mother? - Yeah. Desiree, would you get back in the car, please? No! I've changed my mind, Wade. What's wrong with you? You have a perfectly simple decision. You either take the high life or the low life! - You're the lowlife. - Hey. Don't you think you've embarrassed yourself enough already? Back off, baguette boy! You back off, bucko! Ow! Ooh! Oh! - You... You hit him! - Uh-huh. Ohh... I need to find a better place for that birdhouse. I've got it, thanks. Yep, in front of all of my customers. I don't think I've ever felt so... emasculated. Yeah. Sorry. Is there something I could do to help restore your reputation? Well, since you asked. Surprise! Yeah! I'm sorry, Daddy. There is no franchise deal. I know. Eddie called. You do realize that, if you'd have signed that deal, you'd have your life back on Fifth Avenue right now? It wasn't worth it. Thank you for not selling your daddy out. I'm so proud of you. That means more to me than any penthouse on any avenue. I love you, Daddy. Good girl. Desiree, you did the right thing by Mr. P. - Good job. - And that is something to celebrate. It is. Calvin, let's have some music. You got it, Mr. P. Hey! I'm sorry I'm late. Us peons had to drive. - Eddie! - Plus, I had to pick up my date. - Ooh-whoo! - Tamika! Look at you! You are a goddess. You were right. Once I lost the bulletproof vest, it fit like a glove. So when did you two happen? Well, I could ask you two the same thing. Well, it's party time! What are you thinking? You know, life is sweeter on the other side of the river. Come on, everybody! You stole my light I'm so upset My heart's a wreck I'm one whole mess Get me out I'm up all night Why can't I turn out the light Oh All night, all night Oh All night, all night Oh All night, all night Oh All night, all night Whoa-oh-oh Whoa Whoa-oh-oh Whoa Whoa-oh-oh I'm up all night Why can't I turn out the light
