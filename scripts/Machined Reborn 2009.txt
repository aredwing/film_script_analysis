Yeah, but it's an investment. You didn't sign anything, did you? Yeah, and I got it for a steal. - Take me home. - I can't. What do you mean, you can't? I let go of our lease. No. Call them. Tell them we want it back. They've already rented our place, and this place is ours now. You spent our wedding money? In a couple of years, they're gonna build a freeway just two blocks from here. It took us over an hour to get here. You're not gonna want to drive this every day. I quit my job. I want to start a business here. Come on. Please. Just let me show you the lot. Let me just show you where I want to build our dream home. You see all this? It's all ours. Over there, that's where I want to build our dream house. During the day I'm gonna fix people's cars, and at night I'll design the house. You're gonna fix people's cars? Yeah. I'm an engineer. How hard can it be? Right? Hey, have I ever let you down? No. Hey, come on. Give it a chance. It's only temporary. Let me check in with the movers. Hey, they're gonna be here soon with all of our stuff, okay? Okay. Cade? What do you mean, you can't find our stuff? Hello? Shit. - Cade! - Damn. You scared me. What the hell are you doing up here? I was just talking to the movers. And they said? That all of our stuff will be here next week. Next week? Yeah, next week. Oh, baby. Oh, God! What the hell was that noise? What? Go check it out. It's just coyotes. What's sad is when that freeway comes through here, those animals are gonna lose their homes. But we'll be sitting on a gold mine. Look at these two. Give 'em half the chance, they'll fill my-- ...fill my place up with a bunch of fuckin' bastard rat kids. They fuck like rabbits. - Cade, Cade, wake up! - What the hell are you doing? - There's something under this bed. - What? There's something under this bed, this trailer. I don't know. There's something down there. It's just a bunch of old junk. Please go out there and check it out. All right. Looks like it's just a cat. What is it? Nothing. - Jess! - Cade! The trailer shifted. My arm's pinned. What should I do? Should I call the paramedics? - What do you need? - No. You won't be able to get a signal. If you could help me lift, we might be able to get it out. Okay. - Oh, shit. - I can't make it move. Get the jack out of the car. Get the jack for the car. - Where are the keys? - I don't know. Oh, God! Jess! Hurry! Hurry. Oh, my God! Yeah. No, the other way. Crank it. Thanks. What did the doctor say? He said I might need an operation, but it's too early to say. Cade, I know this isn't the best time to bring it up... There's something really wrong with that place. You want me to sell the place and get my old job back, don't you? They're not gonna take me back with my arm like this. All right. I'll call the real estate agent tomorrow. No. You don't have to. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. You know, you mean the world to me. If it wasn't for you and what you've done for me, God knows where I'd be right now. We don't have $2,500. And that's not the price we agreed on. Deliver our stuff. It's just a bunch of old junk. You must be Jess. - Martin. - Cade. Honey, this is Martin, the Realtor that sold us this place. I hurt it out back. That's too bad. You want to come inside for a drink? You know, l... I just came by to see how you guys were doing. You sure? It'll just take a minute. - I'm late for an appointment already. - Okay. - Nice meeting you, Jess. - Yeah. Happy little... Iittle fucking couple. Need architects, electricians, framers, plumbers, you know... whatever it takes to build a new house. What? You're breaking up. No use for this anymore. I can see you're feeling better. Yeah. That sounds good. Yeah, send 'em out. I'll talk to you later. Cade? Cade! Cade? Cade? Hey, baby. How long have you been here working? Ten minutes. Why? You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. You found my phone. Must've dropped it. Stupid arm, you know? - Are you okay? - I said I'm fine. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go take a nap. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'm tired. Jess? How do you know they're gone? Well, when I looked over the fence, their car was gone. You better be right. Yeah, those folks from the city always have nice stuff. Go wake up your little brother. Cade! Cade! Jess? Cade! Cade! Jess? Jess? Unlock the door. Jess? Jess? Cade. What happened to your... They're gone. Oh, my God. He wants you to kill... He what? Who wants? He wants you to kill anyone that comes on the property, or... or he'll kill me. You'd better f-- You'd better fucking do it. Who in the hell are these two retards? Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! You fuckin' idiot! Grab anything of value. I was. And do it before these people get home! Don't listen to him. Maybe this'll change your mind. Stop it! Stop it! You guys, be quiet. You let her go. Let who go? Why don't you put that down? He's crazy. Shoot his ass! Shut up. Seriously, boy, put the sword down. Guys, let's go. You shot him good, didn't you? Goodness! We oughta go. Oh, no! Oh, no! He doesn't know? He doesn't know? No. Completely unaware of it. Does the guy, like, read newspapers or what? He's not from around here. He moved here after all that went down. Teresa's gonna be so pissed. Who's gonna be pissed? Teresa. She's always pissed about something. Yeah, but you sold the one property we were told to stay away from. So what? It just so happens that you sold the one property-- That Teresa's sister was killed at. What, did she think nobody was ever gonna buy it? Come on. You know, once that freeway goes in over there, everybody's gonna be buying property. She'll get over it. It's just business. Hello? Mr. McBride! Oh, my God! Mr. McBride? I'm from TCR, the architecture firm. Where the fuck are they? Son of a bitch! Cade? That was stupid! I didn't see a goddamn thing! I need to see the kill. That's the whole goddamn point! Cade, you killed someone? No. Jesus Christ. Get over it, bitch. Tell him to put everyone in the room with the cameras so I can see everything this time, bitch. Tell him. Tell him what to do. He wants you to take them all to the room with the cameras. He wants you to wear a part of her... ... Iike other killers do. I think that was their sign. She said Cade was gonna fix cars. Why would she let him talk her into moving all the way out here? Because they're stupid. You're so rude sometimes. Come on. He quits his job, he moves way the hell out here. He's stupid. And she's stupid for following him. Just because you're not friends with Cade anymore doesn't mean I have to stop being friends with Jessie. That's the way it's gonna be, huh? You know, your boy already killed somebody. He's already... He's already a murderer. Like your new hands and feet? Well, they ain't yours, exactly. Your boy, he's got your hands and feet. Sleeps with 'em. Touch a nerve? Curls up with 'em like a little teddy bear. Sorry about that. These nanners get me every time. Well, now that that's done... on to the next agenda. Now, you get ready. We're gonna be putting on the show of shows. Here. This is what I'm thinking. Motor Man's Death Show. Nah? I didn't think so, either. All right, how about this? Motor Man's Torture Show. It's gonna be-- Oh, man. I know how you feel. I can smell that one, too. Hey, guys? Jessie? Jessie? Wow. The place is a fuckin' dump! Jessie? Cade? I'm gonna make me some popcorn for this. Jessie? Cade? Ella? Ella! Ella! Ella! What are you doing? Cade, no. Put it down. Cade, we can figure this out. Kinda scrawny. You ain't nothin' like my first one. Now, he... He was wonderful. You ain't wonderful. What good is a medical license when you do fine work like this? How long's she been missing? She was last seen on the 23rd. What was she doing on the property? She's an architect. She was going to meet the new owners. Somebody bought that place? From what I understand. I bet that drill's hot. I bet that burns, bitchy. I bet that burns. He's getting better. Mr. McBride? Detective Clark and Murray. We'd like to ask you a few questions. Someone's here. Why don't you go around that fence? I'm gonna go right through here. Who's there? Mr. McBride? I just got a couple of questions I want to ask you. This is gonna be good. This is gonna be real good. He's good. This little bastard's good. Hello? This is Detective Murray from the Phoenix Police Department. Miss? Clark? I'm in here. Clark! Shit! Jesus! Where's your gun? He... He must've took it. Okay, could you call for back-up? Yeah. I'll call. Shit! What a fuckin' idiot. I know you're in there, buddy. I won't think twice about blowing your fucking head off. Shit! Go for the gun. Oh, no. Wait. Don't go for the gun. I told you not to go for the gun, jackass. Jackass. Fuck, fuck. Shit! What the helI'd you do that for? And the property owners are fine with it? They're perfectly fine with this. All right, already. I didn't tell 'em. You know what? We are going out there, and we are gonna tell them. Can I go with? I can go Thursday. You're talking now? Yeah. So this is the place. Well, what do we have here? A little thin for my tastes, but they'll do. Look at the pooper on that one. Looks like they're not home. Then we'll wait for 'em. It's not a good idea to be wandering around here. We should stay out here until they get back. Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton Good times there are not forgotten Look away... Dixieland I wish I were in Dixie Hooray Hooray I'm gonna go wait in the car until they get back. "Bodies of the victims "were then stored in a small room to the north of the property." That's right. We were in all the papers. We were all famous. Wow. Where's my car? - Someone took my car! - What? - Where I left it, it's not... - Will you relax? Just calm down. Maybe the owners moved it. What? Did you leave the keys in the ignition? What? What are you looking at? - Where's Karen? - She's off somewhere. I... I told you there's no reception out here. What are you looking for? - Where are you going? - Will you be quiet? Okay. What the hell was that? Martin! Martin! I'm leaving. What? We can't leave without Karen. Yeah, we can. What? Shit. Karen? I think he's on to us, kids. He ain't stupid. I'll give him that. What are you doing? Who are you? What are you-- What are you doing? Good boy. This bitch has got balls of stone. There's no way you can pull that bolt out. Un-fuckin'-believable! Fuck me. Where the hell is she? There she is! What... Karen! Can't believe this one grew some nuts. That skinny little bitch turned sideways and disappeared. There he is. What the hell? You know I don't like it when I can't see you! What the fuck you looking at? Why don't you go the fuck over there and do your goddamn job, you skinny pantywaist fuck-stick! Kinda makes me wish I had the big, lumbering retard from last time, doesn't it? What in the hell are you doing? You little fuckin' prick... ... bastard! That's it. That's fucking it. I am so fucking done with you. I ain't letting go this time, bitch. Cade! Cade! We're gonna find Teresa, and we're gonna get the hell out of here, okay? Where's my camera? I'll find your camera. We got to lock the car. You got to remember to lock the car. I'm gonna get you out of here. Get my camera. Did you get my camera? Cade. Get away from the girl! Get your ass away from the girl now! Now! Oh, I wish I was in Dixie Hooray, hooray I'll make my stand for Dixieland Oh, somethin' somethin', Dixie
