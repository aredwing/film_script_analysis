It is good." Wait. How did you do that? How did you... I forgot to shut it down. Not a problem, I'll just... Sorry about that. -Is not it Nina Swartzcruit? "I have a question. Can someone using shampoo take control of another human being? I do not understand. For example, advantage of a young girl sexually. Convince her.

It was red and orange and light green on the belly. But it never went away. -Must be something we can do, huh? -My plan puts an end to all this. I can help you get rid of the voice permanently. But you must help me. "I'm just so... -Scared? No. It is not there. I'm just so normal.

What have I done?! When I got your eye on my table and saw your picture the first time- -I could not resist to see how similar we are. Go home. So maybe we can cope. Why do you say no to them? Why do you care about me? The longer you are working inside someone, more difficult it becomes to distinguish- -On "me" and... "You". -Nina, then? -What does she want you to do? "She helps me get rid of the voice. -Type, permanently? -Are you going to kill me? -No. Is it not strange that She has not said who she is? -Has she never said... -She is on the damn shampoo bottle.

It has happened and something... "I must go home. -So you thought, just dump me? I just have to go home now. I've been thinking a lot and do not want anybody to get hurt. I understand, really. I know that you have someone waiting at home. But I must tell you something. Come with me. It does not take long. Please. I need you. Perhaps more than you need me. Damn. I'm sorry.

There is actually something else I wanted to ask you. Unbelievable. I thought that you had a girl at home. Yes, I have. But it is not there. I was told that you are Ivan Bahn's daughter. -Have you ever been in New York? -By boat, you mean? Do you? Only in New York I can come out and know just from the smell: "Yes, here I am." -Or in Paris, now, for example. -Sure... You can believe whatever you want; but I have not planned this. Although we would die we have experienced this situation. Huh? Yes, but... I actually planned not to die. Where the hell are you?! They rang from job. You did not come this morning. I would just call the emergency room to see if anything happened to you. ... I called Karl. He offered to keep me company until you came. Hello? Are you there? Is he still there? You know what? It does not matter. Hello...? What do we do now? Do you have... I do not know... a plan? You know what a flux compression generator is? It generates an electromagnetic pulse -To eliminate all electronic equipment within 500 meters radius. Kind of like a lightning bolt that strikes in lnvoice headquarters. Nobody gets hurt. And I will be deleted from the system. -Will not that be something system. -Okay, where do we find one of those? -I already have one. Look! I did not know it was so big.

It's best you follow up with me. -Okay. Do not worry about me, Zelda. I get along. Where are we? I thought we were going up. -Can we smoke here? -Yes, you and I can smoke here. -Did you buy that bell? -What? You mentioned a Patek Philippe with 24 complications at the Christmas party last year. I am wasting my time on you? He came here. So I decided that maybe I should meet him and I did it. Just to say that he should take the first train back to Stockholm. Which I suppose he did. It was a great idea. Very wise. Sometimes we take things and things into their own hands. -Think outside the box, huh? -Yes. That is my motto. It is best for the organization... I am always loyal and thinking outside the box. I know that you do. ONLY He has traveled with her.... Well... Nina. -What happened? -What do you mean? They went into the Metro and... I wonder where they should. -Who is he? -Ralph Parker. He is head of security at Trexx and lnvoice. What is it? I have not been completely honest with you. I met him. The other one. I appreciate your honesty. He exposes us, if he speaks? Now, we are sure he is not included. -You and Stephen are very similar. -Yes, I know, but... If I give you his ID card you can get into. Listen carefully. Take the elevator to floor 1 6; the Scandinavian Department. At Stephen's desk, in your backpack, You will find a Hello Kitty doll.

Did you I was trying to seduce you? Fucking pigs! Would it be so awful if I tried to seduce you? -What? L You're kidding, right? -Are you watching this? Damn... Anna! It is very fascinating. I'll show one of my favorites. Over here we have a partner whose every night when he is asleep... ... For about five minutes... satisfy himself. It was weird. Why are both of the screens? Mr. Bahn, I do not understand. How will the image from your eyes? Sorry, I can not go into technical details, but... Mind if I borrow this? This is a normal hair. Do you see? But for us it may also be an antenna. Dangst contains organic micro-chips , Which embeds itself so deeply in our resident scalp- -It gives us full access for their vision and hearing. And - hang on now... every word that person thinks. -Jeez, it's just amazing. Mr-Bahn, we are waiting for masturbation now? -Anna? -Watch now. What happened? -Where did the woman go? -Come on out.

It is you! -Do me the fuck not! -How dare you come here? Where's Ralph? Why are you just there? I want to hit that person... For five minutes ago! Look at the screen. Satan. Nina... I'm sitting in the second wagon. Have you heard anything? "He is gone. -Are you sure? Have they found the body? It takes weeks before all the bodies are identified. Stefan Ljungberg is wanted. They certainly identifies him first. I was there, I saw it. It was the first time I saw someone... It was so nice.... -What is it? -His tone. You should not be here. I am against the principle of witnesses. So the equation now contains four cells. Now, it happens. I have always thought I would die in his sleep. With closed eyes. Peaceful. -If you are... I do not. "He had lost its function. All right. But what about me? Yes, you do? Here is the station where you get off. Goodbye, Roger. Is it me thinking now? It feels so. Yes, actually, it feels so. Listen. Look in my eyes. Do not use the shampoo. "It's not good for you. -You have nice eyes. I believe you. ... Explosion in Paris at midnight. Anonymous police sources said...
