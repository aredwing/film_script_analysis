Go for a lunch to your aunt. I know. Are you reading or learning? - Hm, I'm learning. - Don't hm me! Do you know how much does it cost? - There are holidays. - I know. I've been looking for you twice in Prague. At school. And I've never found you, it's getting weird. What are you talking about? I'll be back on saturday, we'll speak then. [distant female voices] - Good morning, Marenka. - Good morning. - How did you sleep? - Good. Where were you, girls? - Shall we go home, mr. Berka? - Yeah, we're going. Won't I be cold? No. Here's your scarf. I'm only affraid of a flood. Don't be, there won't be any. Show me your leg. Won't you leave me somewhere? The other one... Shall we go home? You know that we will. [clocks beating] I don't want it for free, mr. Berka, I've got something on an account book. But I don't have it with myself, I've got it at home. I'll wait with it. Get up, I'll put your coat on. You're so nice, I've always returned money to everyone. I know that. A second sleeve. Home. Home. Maybe we won't need a boatman. The river could freeze up. We'll see about that. It's been freezing all night. I couldn't sleep from the cold. A coat and a stick! So, we can go. I'm so glad we're going home. Mr. Berka, are you taking me home? I am. God praise the morning, madame head forester. - Good morning. - How did you sleep? Good. - Where are you going, goodman? - Home, home. You're younger and younger, madame head forester. Hw do you do that? It's only seeming, goodman, I'm a dead woman by now. C'mon! See, you're still so beautiful. [laugh] [laugh] How can we cross the river? You'll sit and I'll get the boatman. And won't it take long? I have to go home. Tonka: Aaaa... [laugh] Aaa... [Tonka's hallooing and laughing] [Tonka's hallooing and laughing] Gross! You s-ku-nk! [Tonka's hallooing and laughing] Come, I'll give you a shepperd! Come then! Come! I've got you! [bugs buzzing] [water buzzing] Help me, mr. Berka! Help me! Alright, I'm coming! Our raft is gone! What raft? Next will come. Wait, it'll be here any moment. Vojta, bring me clothes! - Go and get them! - I won't go naked in front of him! He doesn't know what's happening around him! [fair music] Load by yourself. [fair music] [bugle playing] [Terina's laughing] It'll wrench off! [bugle playing] [music playing] [bell ringing] Terina! Will you come? Don't amuse yourself and do something. Put Liduska to the bed! Father: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Our marry-go-round calls you, 'kay? We call your attention, that our merry-go-round provides prolonged romantic rides for everyone of you. And that's why up, up, on to our beauty! I'm from Dejvice and I will ride you the most-ice! That lady is from Michle and she'll ride you as well as quick-le. Don't hesitate then, and get on our merry-go-round, men! Who will try it with us, it'll give him creeps thus! I've been missing you all day. You don't have a girl? [Tonka's laugh] No. What to do with such a boy... No. [a bugle playing] We have to say goodbye to each other. [a bugle playing] I like you very much too. [a bugle playing] [laugh] - I'll be gone immediately. - Wait a moment at least. No, I'v got to go, they'd look for me. - I've only come to say goodbye. - We can always do that. When are you going off? Tomorrow or day after that. Shall we see each other then? Tomorrow and after that in a year. When we'll come. If you'll be at home on holiday. How come, in a year? That's not possible. That's not possible. No, please, wait. Let's stay like this. - Don't worry about the lunch, granma, I'll be eating at the farmer. - Yeah. Vojta! I'll be waiting for you for the second time. - You don't have to. - You're a fool! Look, I'll be there earlier today. - I thought it's yours. - [laugh] Well, a sister. You do like me the most, don't you? - I still see you with her. - She wouldn't go to bed without me. Show yourself... She should be here by now. - There she goes. - I see. You've slept well, you look very good, mrs. head forester. He's after stroke, he walks only in limbus. He still sees his old friends who are dead. We have to say goodbye to each other, we're going tomorrow. Tomorrow? Why? Well, it's dead here. We'll never see each other again? Don't die on me. Me? Nice hands. What's nice about them? Five fingers, like everyone else's. Could you come this evening? I don't know yet. Rufle the mister. [laugh] I have to see you, I'll wait for you at the pond. Home. I have to go home. Wait. Have some rest and we'll go on tomorrow. Why are you so angry on me? C'mon. Home! Home. [fair music playing] [water fizzling] [distant fair music] [fair music] [music, noise] Father: It's running, it's flying, like at Pepa from Prague. Hanging, whirling, swinging and at world funnily looking. It's beginning mr. sandwich, it's beginning! We'll go there and back, we'll be back after two feasts! What a fun! Pay attention, dear travellers, we're increasing speed! We'll fly from a top to top, carefully with your bum... ...per hats, so that they won't fly away. It's a ride of love, the wind ruffles your hair. The lady here says that nothing lasts forever, nor a love to a girl. And that's why we have to end. Who liked it, can stay, who didn't, can stay twice. Hey, hey, our marry-go-round calls you! [music playing] Give me another rifle. [boys laughing] [boys laughing] It's running, it's flying, like at Pepa from Prague. We'll fly from a top to top, carefully with your bum... ...per hats, so that they won't fly away. What a fun, what a ride, what a fun, what a fun, how already said mr. Man - Where is Terina? - In the car. Father: Increasing speed! It's a ride of love, your hair will get rough. What a fun! The lady here says that nothing lasts forever, nor a love to a girl. Hey, hey, our marry-go-round calls you! Hey, hey... What do you think? Is something worrying you? And you? Yes. What? I don't know. Look, a ring. - Do you want such one? - Yes. Wait, so... - We're so nice. - Hm. What if we got married? Well, why not? - You want to be a teacher. - But I don't want to, my dad does. Don't be, then! Dad would like so much! - I like rather to stray, you know? - I'm seventeen and three sundays. And I'll be twenty. Our dad would buy us a new car. We would go to a cabin in winter, we've got one at Zlatniky. [laugh] Do you eat a lot? Dad sends me when he gets paid, but it's only for milk and a bun. - Sometimes I go to my aunt. - Good for you. - What? - Well, that you're not get used to eat. You'll manage at our place. - What about Victor? - [laugh] Him? Father: Will you say or don't? Mother: You can't answer? Father: You'll not stray at nights, remember that! Your too soft. What if I'd take responsibility for her? Wait a moment. She's still a child. What child? You sneak to me, I wasn't even fifteen. I don't want to wait anymore! Next phase - a parson. She won't go away, offices has to declare her adult. There'll be enough time in winter, no? When there is no work. Don't worry, I'll manage. Ok then? Well... I promised her to you, didn't I? We'll drink tonight. Shall we make it up? The day after tomorrow, we can still have a business here. Hm. Terina! Get sour cherries there to the bastard. For children. Let me out! Open up! - We have to go there before dark! - You're the boss! The train is here! Get in, hurry! It's hot here, in the train. - I'll open the window, yes? - No, no, no, there'll be a tunnel soon. We're in Krhanice, w've got to go. Carefully. - Call in the boatman. - He's coming. - Do you think we'll get there? - Sure. - Do you have a ferry? - I do. What a water tonight. Help me. Help me off the raft. Lend a lantern, there's nothing to see. We'll have to sleep here. We'll go on tomorrow. Oh no, I'm able to go. [music playing] - That's nice. - What? That you haven't gone yet. We're going tomorrow. [music playing] - You know what? - Hm? I'm supposed to get married. Do you? Do I know him? Well, you know. The last one. He'll go nuts. - Who? - Viktor, you know. He sent me for sour cherries. - They were good. - Well. Dad's sending me to Viktor. He sticked at us and for two years he's going only with us. What should I do? You have to know what. What's a medusa? Why? When I'm ruffled, Viktor says I look like a medusa. - That's such a sea monster. - [laugh] I thought it's some beautiful flower. - Shall we talk still about him? - I like you more. Thousands time more than you me. -And do you like Viktor? - No. You know I don't. Only you, you're completely different. Will it be always like that? Dad will be back tomorrow. I prefer for him not to see me. - When he finds out, he'll kill me. - How could it only... Nobody's seen us. Oh no. In order for you to know, I'm not studying, just fooling around. Mum wants to get rid of you, it's clear. It'd be for the best, if I am gone. What'd they say, if you would? They'd get used to it. Let's go together. Well yes, but where to? Anywhere! What about there, today! - How come? Wait. - You said you like to stray. If we want to, we've got to go today. Come! Are you afraid? How can I go like this? - Well, if you don't want... - How come? I want! What can happen to us? We'll be together. No, we might not... Go and bring your things, I'll take something too. - We'll meet here. - Come, when my parents get asleep. Terina! Terina! Where is Terina? You're asking for the ten time. You sent her somewhere yourself. [music playing] Terka! Terina! Come out! [Terina's crying] Hey! Don't hide! I see you! Both! What do you want? Where do you have her? - Where do you have her? - Whom? Get out, you thief! [noise of a match] I've got to go home! Lead me home! Do you want to kill him? Let him go, granpa! We'll go immediately. [Terina's crying] What's up, grandpa? Let me get warm here a little, I beg you, mr. Berka. Let me be here. Come then. Is it you... Vojtisek... You've recognized me, grandpa? Lights up, so that I can see you. Thank goodness, I'm at home. Where's the dad? He'll come tomorrow. That's good, that's good. [distant music] Why don't you sleep? - What are you doing there? - Oh, nothing. We should cut through the black currant in the garden. It's not too light there. I'm glad you're better. Granpa! Should I keep the lights on? Granpa! What could happend to us? We'll be together. Vojta! Vojta! [music playing from the pub] Where were you? And what about this finery? No, no... - So you want to escape! - Let go, give it to me! With the boy, don't you? With the sprat! I dealt with him nicely! He won't be sticking his nose even out of his house. Don't you know people? Would you go with a fair girl? - I don't care! I'll escape anyway! - Don't cry on me here! Where is your cap?! I won't send you for the second time for anything. The night trips are over. And sleep, now! Come, mum made a bed at my place. We're getting married, so what? [music playing] What's a medusa? I thought, it's some beautiful girl. Vojta! Come out! Leave me, I can't! It's warm there, isn't it? Your hands are so cold! - Granpa... - Leave granpa be. You'll gladly come eventually. As soon as the comedian girl is gone, don't you? You always know everything! [death bell tolls] What's with dad? You have to, you're so thin. Aunt, leave me be! When? At night. You've got to eat something. Eat, so you won't be beaten to death in the army. - What a speeches, aunt, stop it. - You didn't have to, Marka. - I can't even think about food. - You've got to eat. Even today. You at least, Vojta. Let him be, he'll take the air, he didn't have any holiday. He was still looking after the granpa. Terina! Terka! Terina! [a bugle playing] [a bugle playing] - What did he die of? - Diphteria. - When? - In those times in winter. - And how long were you... - We hadn't even time to get married. She died... ...two months after that. We couldn't send her to a doctor. Why? She refused with a living power. She probably wanted to die. [music playing] Viktor: What's up? [lowering noise of a tractor] [music playing]
