Some mick band folk crap. Hey, I'm trying to share some cultural diversity... here with you ignorant fucks. The music of my people, all right? And all you got to do is hurl racial epithets? Ladies and gentlemen... The Drovers! 1... 2... 3... 4. Mother Mary, would you look at her? Nice. Hey, John, is she one of your people? I think it's his mother's side... County Cork or some kind of crap like that. Hey, did your mother look like that? Oh, my God... would you look at the wheels on that mother! Gentlemen, I got a pronouncement to make. I am going to know that girl. I mean, know her. Fat chance! When was the last time you got laid? Come on, when was the last time you got laid? Was it Carter-Mondale, huh? Goldwater! Goldwater! I bet you 10 bucks... you can't nab that girl on stage. You'll have to come up with more money than that. All right. I got you. I'll bet you 20 bucks... 20 that you can't get her to smile. 20 bucks that what? You can't get her to smile at you. That I can't get her to smile at me? What are you, deaf? I'm taking money from children. Take my motherfucking money. Come on. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Shake it, baby! See, white boys can't dance. That's the problem. White boys can't dance. I keep telling you. She's gonna look! Hey, mama, are you looking? Oh, yeah! Go, Johnny, go! Go! Go! Oh, yeah, yeah! Get in there. There you go! She's not even... she's not even looking at him! Yeah! Mmm! Show us the whole business, yeah! Give us the redeye, baby! Come on, show us the goods! Great show, guys! Great show! The Sun Times lady was here. She may have been dancing. Either she was dancing... or she had gum stuck on her shoe. - Emma. - Yeah? I see you have a groupie. Ralphie's my groupie, aren't you, boy? No. No, I mean, who's the asshole? I heard about that. What happened? Gave us a great big anatomy lesson. Oh. How big? Nice doggy. Hello, Mr. Cuchetto. Emma. OK. That's my baby boy. We're home. Good boy. All right. Go get your bunny, Ralphie. Come on, jump up. Yeah. There you go. Good boy. Hello? Hi. It's Dr. Pierce. Doc, it's Saturday night. Why aren't you on a date? I don't have dates. I... I have seminars. Emma, we have a donor. I pulled a few strings at the eye bank. What are you saying? Would you like to do it now? It's, uh, Brody, Emma. B-r-o-d-y. 247 West Damen Street, apartment 2B. 247 West Damen what? She's been waiting 20 years... and you want to fill out forms? How you doing? I think you're more excited about this than I am. I'm getting new wallpaper... and I just have to have your opinion. Yee-hah! Just relax, Emma. Count sheep. I don't remember sheep. I keep picturing Wile E. Coyote. Count something you know a lot of. Not men, thank you. How about your jobs? OK. Uh, carton packer... ticket taker... suicide... hotline operator... tiny dog trainer... hooker... no, not really. I love you all. Oh, God! Are you the new Mr. Whitney? No, kid, I'm Santa Claus. Don't you recognize me? Santa already came at Christmas. Yeah, well, I had one more gift... for Mrs. Whitney. You got one for me? Why not? 'Cause you're a bad kid. But Mrs. Whitney was good? I have absolutely no idea. See this? This is for sugar... candy. No mind-altering substances with that, OK? Some of your fans are here to observe. Bobby, are you there? I'm here, Emma. Good. 'Cause I got to check you out. You won't be sorry. What's the first thing I'm going to see? Probably my face. Keep the bandage on. Stop. I'm scared. It's scary. Could you ask the others to leave? Sorry. That was a joke, about your face. I know. I, uh, I just wish I'd seen it before... so I could prepare myself. Picture the last one you saw. That's my mother's. I never want to see a face like that ever. Don't expect too much at first. It's just the one eye. Keep your lids closed. We have to see if this eye works... before we do the other one. I'm going to open your lids. You have no depth perception now. Here I am. Oh, Dr. Pierce... It's nice to see... to see you. Who is it? Hello? Hello? I walked into her room, she looked right through me. She couldn't tell if anybody was there. What the fuck... can I say fuck in here? I guess you can. What kind of a doctor are you? I'm an ocular surgeon... and I can't discuss Emma's case... with anyone but Emma or family. The band is her family. We've got an interview. She can't handle that yet. She's been on her own since she was 15. She handles a lot. She wants you to think that. You want to take care of her. Men react this way to Emma. I do take care of her. I'm her doctor. Can she see or not, doctor? You know what it's like to be sleeping... and someone turns on the light? How it hurts, and you squint... and you stumble around... and it takes you some time to adjust. Effectively, Emma's been sleeping for 20 years. Humans reach visual maturity at age 9. Emma was blinded at 8. We just don't know what she'll see... or how well she'll see it. Can I help you? Good morning. Anything... hey! Hey! Careful? Are you all right? - Jesus. - Yes, I'm fine. You sure you didn't break anything? I'm fine, thanks. There was a woman just now. She had flowers. Did you see her? She had a hat. A hat? Well, you... you... you mean Candice? That was Candice? That was yesterday, Emma. No, she was here 2 seconds ago. Tell her to come back. Candice was here yesterday. Yesterday? Wow. There is some research out there... about a perceptual delay... in the early days of the surgery. I don't understand. It's like a flashback. You see something new... but don't understand what it is until the next day. You think that's what happened? No, no, no. I think you were dreaming. Look over there. Your second eye is healing well... but the next few months might be difficult. You may experience... a wavering in and out of focus. You may be able... to see sharply in your peripheral vision... while your central vision remains blurry. Or things might suddenly jump into focus. Other than that, you're ready to go. Go where? Home. I want my money back. Thanks. Thanks, bro. You all right? Yeah. Which one? There it is. That? Ralph! Hi! My God, look at you, you're so gorgeous! You hunk of burning love! I love you! Emma, hey! This is my friend... from the Sun Times. The reporter. He's gorgeous! He's beautiful! I can't believe this! Have a seat in the kitchen. What was your condition, the technical terms? I had traumatic cataracts... and severely damaged corneas. From? My mother smashed my head into a mirror. Michael, can you get the phone? Michael! Michael! Why? I wasn't supposed to play with her makeup. These surgeries... have been fairly routine for years now. How come you didn't know about them before? Um, well, I was told my retinas were screwed up. My mother and her doctor... said I wouldn't be able to see again. But now you see normally? Things are still kind of jumbled... and it's going to take a little time... but every once in a while... I see something really clear. It's the most incredible thing. Are you pretty? Do people tell you you're pretty? My boyfriend does. That's nice. OK. You're on your own, little man. Go on. Go upstairs. Good boy. Go on. Go on. Hey. L... I don't need any help. I'm fine. I wasn't asking. The mailman put one of your letters in my box. I slid it under your door. Thanks. Time... 3:48 A.M. Mr. Cuchetto? It's all right. I took care of it. Go back to bed. Hey, Ralphie, yeah. Here's your rabbit. That's a good boy. Time... 8:32 A.M. All right. Mom's up. I'm up. Oh, shit. Valerie! Mr. Cuchetto? Wait! Hey, lady, watch where you're going! I'm sorry, miss. You're in the wrong place. How did you get up here? I took the stairs. Look, can you help me or not? I've got roll call in a couple of minutes. I'll give you a case report form... I want you to start filling out... and I'll help you finish it later. No, I can't do this. Ridge, what about this cross she's wearing? Who's wearing a cross? Nina Getz... the naked dead girl in the bathtub. Look, it's very simple. Give a description... of what it is you're trying to tell me. I told you! I need you to go to 247 West Damen... Excuse me. Detective Hallstrom, we just got here! The watch has yet to change. Ease up. Get your feet off the lieutenant's desk. Go to 247 West Damen St. My name is Emma Brody... What do you want me to do about it now? How about some detective work for a change, jagoff? Jagoff? Could I speak to Detective Hallstrom? Help yourself. Is that... is he over there? Yes, right this way. Thank you. I got Nina Getz's parents calling me on the hour. You want to talk to them? Are you Detective Hallstrom? Uh... yeah. I'm trying to eat my breakfast here. Can I help you? You were blind? Until 6 weeks ago, yes. You were blind completely until 6 weeks ago? Um, let me get this straight. I'm a little bit confused here. You heard some suspicious noises upstairs... and you hear this guy coming down the stairs... you look out, and you spoke to him? That was last night... but you didn't see it till this morning? That's right. Yeah. So, what is that? Your eyes are driving the train... and your brain's the caboose... it hasn't caught up yet? I guess you could say that, yeah. So your eyes are having a delayed reaction to reality? I don't know how to explain this. It's something that happens... with some people who've had this kind of surgery. We're a little off-track. I came here to tell you I think something's wrong. OK. It's all right. Thank you. Um... how long were you blind? Are there any cops around here who work... or do you just sit around and drink coffee? Now, did you happen to consume... any alcoholic beverages last night? You don't believe me? Did you have anything to drink? It's a simple question. - Wine. - Wine? Oh, wine. How much... wine? A little. A lot, look... If you'll excuse me... I can see the seven dwarfs doing cartwheels... on a little... a lot of wine. I'm very happy for you. Have a nice day, Miss Brody. There was someone in that hallway. I could smell him. Smell? What does it say on this? Fuck you, detective! No. That's not what it says. Listen, lady... that's not 5 feet away from you. You don't see very well. Ralph, come. Come on. Hey, Miss Brody? Why did you ask for me? I liked the sound of your voice. Hey, John. Who put all this shit on my desk? Ridgely's having his breakfast. Ridge? Get your shit off the lieutenant's desk... would you? You know, I didn't dream that guy up. He was there. The police are checking into it, right? That's what they say. They acted like I was an incompetent. Just explain to them. He acted like I was an idiot. I never used to care what people thought. I'm sorry. Are you telling me that what other people think... is who you really are? The last time I looked... I was a little girl, and l... I... I blink... and I look like my mother. I look like her. You're not her. You're not what that cop thinks. You're... you're very attractive. Don't you see that? Don't you see anything beautiful? I have no idea what beautiful is. Uh... music's beautiful... but the things that I see... they make my head hurt... and my heart. Maybe you should be glad. Most people are numb... by the time they reach your age. I would love to be numb for a while. No. You wouldn't, Emma, believe me. You wouldn't. All right, all right. Give us some room, guys. Yes, sir. Sorry to fuck up your date. I told her to wait for me. "Relax in a nice hot bath," I said. This ain't no crackhead. This girl's got folks. No, no. That's actually what I said. What was her name? Her name was Valerie Wheaton. The landlord Cuchetto found her. Her boss called, worried... she hadn't shown up at work for 2 days. We got jimmy marks on the fire escape window... which suggest the offender... accessed the apartment here. There was a struggle in the front room... he strangled her, then he raped her. The disarray suggests that he dragged her body here... postmortem. Just like Nina Getz. Looks like she found God in the same jewelry box. Why do you suppose... he slashes their wrists after they're dead? Because he's suicidal... no, his mother's suicidal. How the hell should I know? All right, miss, I'm going to make this quick. Who did this to you, hmm? Not talking? All right. It's your funeral. You're a sick bastard, John. Pull that over. She's a stinker. Yeah, what else is new? See this? Police! Hi, I'm Detective Hallstrom... She's dead, right? Yes, she is, uh... do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Come in. What's with the candles? You expecting someone? No, they're just easier on my eyes. I can turn on the light if you want. Is there anything else you can tell me... about Valerie Wheaton? No. I never really spoke to her. I mean, the most I can tell you... is that she took stairs 2 at a time... and she was kind of a noi... She was... what? She was a noisy lover. Oh. Noisy lover, huh? Did she have a boyfriend that you know? Yeah, she did. Was this one guy, or a lot of guys? No. One guy. How do you know it was one guy? I could hear him. OK. You got a name on him? Oh, baby. Oh, baby? OK. Could you go over for me one more time... exactly what happened when you opened the door? I looked out... but I couldn't see very well because of... Your operation, you're drinking wine, right. And? Well, I heard breathing... and then I said, "Mr. Cuchetto?" And he said "Yes," But it wasn't Cuchetto, 'cause Cuchetto says he's sleeping... his wife verifies that. And you didn't recognize straight off... that it wasn't the building manager's voice? Well, he whispered. He whispered? Yeah. All right. Um... I have to ask you to come down to the station... and we'll do up a sketch... and I need you to look at some pictures. - Right now? - Please. So... how is your vision? Can you see me clearly now? "Detectives do good under cover." That's that flashback thing you were talking about? Is that a reference to police work or fucking? It's just a dick joke. A dick joke? Dick, uh, detectives. We call ourselves dicks. Ahh, I see. With good reason, you're probably saying. All right, I'll give you my card here. If you remember anything after tonight... anything at all, please give me a call. My beeper number's on the back, and it's 24 hours. - OK? - OK. I hate this. Do you like flowers? Flowers? You got soft skin for a man. It smells like that lotion... they make out of roses. You know that guy on the stairs? He had a weird smell. He smelled bad? No, not bad. Some kind of strange strong soap and sweat. "Strong soap. Sweat." Is that it on the smells? Well, there was something else. L... I'm probably just imagining it... Why don't you tell me anyway? There were these 7 little men behind him... doing cartwheels. We've got semen from the swabs and the carpet... and we've recovered skin cells... from under the fingernails of the deceased... but we figure the killer wore gloves... 'cause so far we got no prints. We got the boyfriend out of bed. He's in there weeping up a storm. So... he's got an alibi. It checks out. Forget him. She can't see the mug shots. Well, get a magnifying glass. What do you think, John? This one's got hair on it. A serial? Just take your time. If he is, he's just getting started. We cross-referenced his M. O... the cross, the wrist, bathtub, necrophilia... with the national computer. We got nothing, which is good. Means he's probably not a drifter. And if he lives here, we'll catch him. 'Cause we got an eyewitness. Well, of sorts. No, check that. We got an eye, ear, and smell witness. She smile at you yet? No. She's one tough cookie. Listen, she's got this vision problem... but I think she's for real. She checks out so far. All right, look, I'll clear your boards. From now on, you got one case and this is it. She may not be enough... so let's see if we can get some more. Put this one to bed quick, John. Nail him. Don't let them write a book about this guy. Oh, that was good. Think I'm getting the hang of this? Oh, yeah. You'll be fucking mayor by 40. Emma! I'll show you! You little whore! What's up, Emma? The girl died... and there was nothing you could have done. Candice, if there is anything beautiful... in this hellhole of a city... I would love to see it. Christ! Control yourself, all right? I can't help it. He makes me nuts. You're making me nuts. I can barely see the guy. Put a cork in it, OK? You've got the whole blind woman thing going. What blind woman thing? Everybody says blind women are great lovers... and you're in tune with your sense of touch. I want to know if it's true. You've done it with your eyes closed. Figure it out. I want to know. All right, I'll tell you, but if you tell anybody... I swear to God, I'm going to kill you. - Promise? - Yes, I do. OK. This is the deal, all right? I can't believe I'm telling you. I never got nervous around men. I just pulled them into whatever I was fantasizing... and I was in control. I've felt attractions... to voices, scent, and conversation... but it could really be anybody. That's the whole thing. Oh, Michael! He looked at me. Oh, my God. - Johnny? - Yo! This model is like the Honda of Byzantine crosses. There's 4 churches in our area alone... got them in their gift shop. They even got a goddamn catalog. He could've got them anywhere. Fuck. Yo, squire, someone fucked up. We got one of the fiddler's letters... in Valerie Wheaton's mail. - So? - Take it over to her. We'll throw in a c-note if you sink the salami. Hey, hey, guys. No way. Not this time. Bullshit. No, I'm serious here. I'm going by the book. What book is that? You think I'm going to waste this body... on a ball-busting blind broad who can't see it? Come on. - Sold out! - Great crowd. Must be the article today in the Sun Times. I'm great. I'm fuckin' great. Oh, don't worry about it. Have a good time. Here you go, Emma. Gotcha! The mike is right here. Thanks. You're going to be fine. Good luck. Ladies and gentlemen... the Metro is proud to present The Drovers. All right, here we go. 1, 2, 3. Candice! Call Detective Hallstrom now! Go! Keep moving. Keep moving, please, folks. Thank you. Keep moving. Keep moving. Thank you. All right, we picked up some guys... that were loitering in the neighborhood. They've been kind enough to volunteer for a lineup. We'll need you to come, too. Can we drop Ralph at home? Sure, yeah. We'll use the siren. Oh, uh, here, take a whiff of that. Line up over here. Come on. Face the front. Everybody, turn to the right. Now face front one at a time... starting with number one. Number four. Are you sure? I thought it was him. OK. Come on. We're done. All right. Eyewitness, my ass. Let them go. What happened? I thought you said your eyes were getting better. - They are. - Oh, yeah? How much better are they, huh? It's been a hell of a rough night, Hallstrom. OK, you tell me. Can you read? Can you tell time? Can you walk down the street... without a dog leading the way? Can you walk down a street with that bug up your ass? How were you blinded? What?! How were you blinded in the first place? My mother. Your mother? I'm not going to talk about this with you. Your mother blinded you. That must have really contributed... to your mental health. Do you want to say that again? Number four was a uniform across town... the night of the murder. You identified a copper as the murderer. Don't people make mistakes? Normal, seeing people? Maybe he wasn't even there! Now you're starting to piss me off, all right? I get this kind of shit all the time at the station. Guy saying, "I saw a robbery." "Hey, man, I saw a murder down there on division." I had a guy once tell me... he saw Elvis Presley at his brother's bar mitzvah. Crazy people, that's what you're talking about. Lonely people, people who like attention. People who like attention?! Yeah! Like a guy who strips naked... and shakes his ass in a bar full of people! You saw me? No. The guys in the band recognized you. Well, uh... things are not what they seem. What? It's a little secret detective credo I have... the soul is dead that slumbers... and things are not what they seem. Oh... oh, brother! You are really something. A cop quoting Longfellow. It's disgusting. Hey, hey! I just use it to pick up women. Yeah? I bet it works. Frankly, not as well as my handcuffs. You're the first one to know who it is. I can't believe you know who it is. Most of the women I go out with... think it's a line from Guns N' Roses. L... I don't know your first name. John. Would you like to have some coffee... John? What do you think he's talking about? I think he's trying to find a rhyme for "pretentious." - Pretentious? - Yeah. Park benches, pal. That was very good. You want to write me some lyrics? You want to catch a murderer? 1, 2, 3, go. He doesn't like blood. There was a man from Nantucket... what? He doesn't like blood. He slits their wrists. That's the last thing he does... but he scrubs his hands so raw I could smell them. Then he gets out. He doesn't want to see her bleed. That's very good. Why? You tell me. His kills are clean so they can be... nice and pretty while he... Does this rhyme with Nantucket? Yeah. Your normal rapists, they like the live ones... the look in their eyes when the knife comes out. Oh, yeah, they get off on that... but this guy, this guy just wants a body... a fucking blowup doll that won't fly out the window... when you squeeze it too hard. But they're still struggling, moving... so he strangles them to stop them... from kicking and moving around... and then it gets weird. He fixes them up like her... like someone he once knew... and then he slits their wrists. Why? To make sure they never go back... to being what they were... that there lies his fantasy preserved... pickled in her own juices. I don't know. You're good at your job. Sometimes my job... is the only thing I am good at. Oh, I doubt that. Think you're going to catch him? You think you saw him? Yeah, I did. All right, then we'll catch him. "X." Uh... "L, M, B." That's OK. Try this one. "Z... M... I... O." All right. And this? Whose eyes are these? They don't work. Miss Brody, those are the corneas... of two healthy girls in their early 20s. Really? Whose? I know a little about one donor. The family wrote to me. How did this donor die? Auto accident. Well, can I meet her, her family? That's not a good idea. Do they want to meet me? What's the problem? Emma, you have to move on... repair your life, and so do they. Don't prolong their grief. You're just like John. Neither of you... can go to work until somebody dies. John... Detective Hallstrom. You saw him again? I had a little panic at the club last night. Are you all right? I'm fine. My playing's for shit. Maybe I could help somehow. What? Emma? Nothing. Ralph's parked on level three. Aren't you supposed to give him... to another blind person? No. He's too old. He gets to retire. I guess I'm the lucky one in a way. Call me... anytime. OK. Thanks. Here's your dog. There you go. Do you know when the next train is? About 6 minutes. You got plenty of time. All right. Thanks a lot. See you. Bye-bye. Ralph! Come on. What? You stay put. Ralph, where are you? If that's food, you're dead, pal. You're such a doofus. That's just a train, Ralph. Ralph, come. Ralph, come. Oh, my God! Easy, boy. OK, we might have some fractures in the rear... possibly a broken pelvis. I can feel at least 2 broken ribs. And I think there's some internal bleeding... so we've got to get him to the hospital. - Let her go. - Thank you. What? There's nothing out there. He was there. Did you see him? Not very clearly, no. Do you ever see anything clearly? It was that soap smell. I can still smell it. What else? Some kind of necklace, like a cross or a medallion. I never told her. Show me this cross. No. I got to be with my dog. This is very important. Show me where that is. I'll take care of him. Thanks, Dr. Alexander. Hang on, baby. All right. It was here. I saw it. We combed every inch of this place. Emma, the vet's ready to go. Come on. How far to the hospital? There's no cross here, John. You saying she's lying? I want to believe her. I want a witness as badly as you do. I just think this guy's a figment of her imagination. Believe me, the guy was here. How do you know? This isn't even his pattern. He kills them in the home. I don't remember seeing a bathtub around here. She's not part of his string. She's a witness. It's different. Let me know as soon as you hear anything. Mitch, what about the cross, huh? She saw the cross. She could have overheard that at the station. How much do you know about this girl? I know what I need to know. No, what you want to. You're not doing your homework, my friend. The doctor told me she hallucinates. Yeah, we know that. Not the killer, smart ass... other things, from her past. Look, a girl in her building was murdered. She's afraid, her mind makes this stuff up. I'm telling you something happened here tonight. The girl's a dead end. She hasn't led us anywhere. This guy has stumped me. You've always trusted my instincts before. What the hell's different now? You stuffed your instincts in the trunk, my friend. Your dick is driving the car. Fuck her and get on with the goddamn case! I don't want to fuck her. Isn't one of you enough? Can you smell that? No, that's not it. How's the dog? He has to stay there for a while. Don't turn on the light. You want something to drink? No, no. I'm not staying. What are you trying to do here? Turn that off, please. You think having the lights off... is gonna make everything OK? Just let me pretend for a while. Pretend what, that you can't see? I can't see. I can't see things that are right in front of me... and I can see things that couldn't be there. For all I know, it was Cuchetto on the stairs. I saw Valerie after she died. I saw my mother. Want to see me cry? Boo-hoo! My dog got hit by a Cadillac. Now get the fuck out of here. Simmer down. Is this the cross you saw? Is it? How about this one? That's it. Why didn't you tell me... about these other hallucinations you had? Because it wouldn't make me a credible witness. Isn't that right? Isn't that what you're here to tell me... that I'm a nut and you're moving on? Why do you think I assigned someone to protect you? I can protect myself. With what... darkness? I survived 20 years... without sight or a cop at my door. That's great. What are you going to do... break every lamp in the house? No. Take the bulbs out. You need some light? You creep. - Just lay down! - No! Listen to me! You want to be raped... strangled, and drowned in a bath of your own blood? If you want to keep your ass alive... you're gonna have to help me. You better be strong. Strong like you? Let go! Don't test me. Why did you come here? You better get some sleep. I don't want to sleep. I got to go. Someday that dam you built's going to break, detective. What you got there? Soap. It's from the hospital. Surgical, antibacterial. She saw him there last night, right? She smells the same weird soap. So you're going to bring her in... for a detergical lineup... like some kind of goddamn commercial? What the hell are you doing? Anyone at the Byzantine churches recognize the drawing? Hallstrom, Crowe's on 501. Joe. Hallstrom. You lost her? Asshole rookie fuckup. This lady asked me to take her picture. Patroleo jagoff is what you are. I should have known... when she wanted to bring the violin. She had the violin? Some strange fate Might wait for them Fortune turns her wheel When fortune turns her wheel Emma, really great. Ready to go? You two know each other. Yeah. What are you doing here? Just doing my job. What are you doing here? Hey. Sounded good. Where are your glasses? You wear glasses, right? Contacts. So which one's your date... Grumpy or Doc? Thank you for asking me. Let's do it again sometime. It was great. Good night. You all right? You and the doctor... I wanted to get on with my life... but I just can't see him that way. Why is that? Because my eyes are filled with someone else. What are you smirking at? Huh? You are in serious trouble. You're going to need fucking flippers... to wade through the shit you're in. The lady was so upset... I had to sack out on her couch. Hysterical crying and shit. You know, I'll have to write this up. You know that? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. There was one time... me and my friend Dennis... we were 8 or 9... we were in the front row of the grand stand... and I had a Coke in my hand. And when I looked down... I mean, it was a direct hit. And I said right there and then... I said, "I'm going to live in one of these buildings... with a view like this." What? You want to go inside? Shh. Wait, wait, wait. Open your eyes. I want you to look at me. My face is so fat... I don't think Ray wants to sleep with me anymore. I'm growing a mustache. No, it's the medication. They're not here. Ray took them to the movies. Look, come over. I haven't felt this good in years. Marlene... OK, OK. Honestly, Marlene, I'm not made of glass. OK. Bye. What's this? Van Morrison. Mm-hmm. And this? Vivaldi. Mmm... this? Pearl Jam. God, you're eclectic. What's this one? That's The Drovers. You're kidding. You bought ours? Yeah. That night I saw you guys. They sold them in the hallway. God, you're one of 3 people who bought it. No, I'm all 3 people. Of course, I was drunk. Figured I could give 'em away... for Christmas presents. I think I could fall in love with you. Thank you, I guess. You're welcome. Unfortunately... I got to go to work today. Hallstrom. Don't bother me. Wait, wait. Lieutenant? Aw, holy shit. Yeah. I'll be right there. There's been another murder. Milwaukee. Why don't you just come in here and sit? How long was this one dead before they found her? What's she doing here? Not even an hour. The husband came home with the kids. Would you come with me, please? - What? - Come on. What's going on with this girl? I happen to like her. Is it any of your business? Yeah, it's my business because it's my ass. Mitchell's talking about... putting another team on the case. Mitchell's what? Who the hell's he going to put on this case... that's not already working on it? I mean, we followed every goddamn lead. We got enough evidence to put the guy away for life. We've got one fucking problem... we have no idea who did it. And she is the only one that saw that killer. That's why I keep coming back to her. I'm telling you, she's the key. To the case or to you? Ridge... I bought her flowers. I bought her fucking flowers. Me. If you two are through making out... I'd like to see you in my office, please. What have we got? We got victim number 3 in Wisconsin. He's hitting his stride now. Nina Getz, Valerie Wheaton, and now this. Somebody's got to go to Milwaukee this afternoon... and tell them that we ain't got jack shit. It sure as hell isn't going to be me. Be sure and show 'em that drawing you got... from a blind witness. You just keep pushing me. Hey, you need it! Then don't you just take me off... this fucking case right now. Oh, ho! No way, Jos. You're going right down with me, asshole. Why don't you lighten up, lieutenant? Stay out of this, Ridgely. You two know more about this case than anybody. This guy's out there laughing at you, man. He's beating you. I want you to go out and shut the motherfucker down... 'cause you're not getting off the case. You're going to retire on this one. I'm going straight to Milwaukee. I don't know when I'll be back. I'll get you a ride from someone downstairs. I got this fucking jagoff of a lieutenant... who's blaming me for the fucking murder. Here for the murder? They're all inside. You live here? I'm sorry. Why do people say that? Why don't they just say that it sucks shit your mom's dead? We'll be coming to Chicago tomorrow. I wish I had more to tell you guys. Sometimes it takes a new victim... new input to a case to break it wide open. We're going to have to do an autopsy. She marked her driver's license. The donation was very important to her. You can imagine. Is there nothing you can do? She lost too much blood from the wrist wounds... for them to be in any shape for donation. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Well, thank you very much for your kindness. Brought those home last night... for her. How many has he killed? As far as we know, 2. Including my wife? No, no. Your wife is number 3. Don't call my wife a number. Her name is Margaret Tattersall. I'm, uh... I'm real sorry, sir. What have you been doing down there? Why didn't you catch him? What have you been doing? Want some coffee or anything? Oh, no. I'm in enough trouble already. But thanks. OK. See ya. Holy shit. When did this happen? When you were with her. Christ. Why didn't you beep me? Hey, John, you were in Milwaukee. Look, I've got a patroleo with her. Who? Crowe? Aw, Jesus, Tommy. I told him to call me... if anything happens... anything at all. Let me ask you something. You believe her, don't you? Yeah, sure, I believe her. Tommy, could you take over for Crowe through tonight... just till I get my head fucking straight here? Good morning, Miss Brody. Where's John? He's working. You'll be safe with me. Well, can you tell me when he'll be available? No. No message. Miss Brody! It's Detective Ridgely. Is everything all right? Did you get my messages? I've been calling you... and calling you. Are you OK? Where's Ridgely? Ridgely? What are you... Do you have a death wish or something? Jesus Christ, Emma. Now you listen to me. While we were goofing around... another woman got murdered. I am gonna get someone to take you home... and you stay there with the cop who's assigned to you. Please don't palm me off on somebody else. I have to talk to you. I got to work on this full-time all the time. Ridgely's a good cop. He's gonna look after you. Is Ridgely gonna take over fucking me, too? Did you enjoy that? What the hell am I to you... one of your little conquests? I've seen your friends smirk at me. You think I'm stupid? What do you tell them? You give them a full report? Listen to me. I'm a little bit busy right now... to be playing Romeo to your Juliet. I have one or two minor things on my mind... not the least of which is finding this killer... before he finds you... so simmer down and stop acting... like some love-crazed teenager. You are such a prick. Emma... I like you. You're a very interesting... unusual woman. You're so full of shit. Don't you dare treat me like we just met in a bar. Well, we did, didn't we? Fuck! What do you want me to say, huh? You want me to say I love you? Is that what you want? Look at us. You think we have some kind of future together... some kind of suburban bullshit? Huh? You're the type of woman... who needs a man you can control. Well, guess what... I'm not that man. I'll show you! You little whore! Oh, Jesus Christ. Emma, let me see your hand. You keep the fuck away from me! Get the fuck away! How the fuck could you let her get out alone? You crossed the line, John. You put the girl in jeopardy. Yeah, well, I didn't lose her. She's reckless because of you! To get to you! Now, I'm gonna go get her, bring her home... and handcuff her to the fucking banister! She's gone! Oh, man! She's probably at the EI. Come on. No. No way! You stay out of this! You fucked up enough already! Come on. Couldn't you have said something... she wanted to hear? Anything? Couldn't you have lied? I did lie. Help! Help me! The mailman put one of your letters... in my box. I'll give you some medication. I'm growing a mustache. Miss Brody. It's me. It's Detective Ridgely. You all right, honey? Take this. Miss Brody. Don't you ever try... to sneak off on me like that again. You understand? It's all right. Hey, Barry. Long night, squire? Hospital bills. You got a file for every nosebleed in Illinois? If you'll just be patient... Thank you. But this says 3B. Yes. Miss Brody lives in apartment 2B. Somebody made a mistake. That's right. Valerie Wheaton died in apartment 3B. Who has access to these files? Only hospital personnel. I want a list. All right. Do you by chance recognize the handwriting on this? This looks like Dr. Pierce's writing. What were you doing at the El station... so late at night? Why do you want to know? Does it have anything to do with Detective Hallstrom? Look, I don't want to talk about it, OK? You don't like him because you... What? Wanted you for myself. I'm sorry. This is stupid of me. You're ready for contacts... if you want them. Or glasses. They'll correct you to 20/50. Do you think I saw the killer? Seeing isn't something that happens to you, Emma. It's something you do. I gave you the equipment. It's up to you to control it. If you invent these visions, you can stop them. Do you think I invented him? Doesn't matter what I think. What do you think? I'll call you later. I got to go. Oh, sergeant, hi. It's Detective Hallstrom from Chicago. I'm trying to find out if Margaret Tattersall... spent any time in a hospital recently? A lot of time? She got a new kidney. Hey, you just can't... That's OK. It's OK. It's all right. Where's John? What's the problem? I have to tell him something. I'm expecting John any minute. There's been another murder. In Indiana. Indiana? Is there something you want to tell me? No, nothing. The smell on the killer's hands... it's surgical soap. He must take it with him. He washes his hands with surgical soap... to get rid of the blood. I don't like this. Nina Getz was my patient for many years. The man has killed 3 people. A donor's identity is strictly confidential. Here it is. Leslie Davison. OK, follow me here. Frank's victim... Margaret Tattersall... had a kidney transplant 2 months ago. So? Our victim... Nina Getz... had skin grafts from an organ donor... about 2 months ago. Valerie Wheaton never had a transplant. No, but the woman who lived below her did. Emma Brody... she had a corneal transplant... and, it turns out... her apartment number is listed incorrectly... on her medical records. This guy meant to kill Emma Brody. Holy fuck! OK. So you got the letters... and the organs, right? What's the connection? I'm not done yet. Nina Getz's donor's name... was Leslie Davison. All right? What if our guy knew her at church, work, or something... and he's obsessed with her? But she dies. She donates her organs... and he goes after the people that have them. Now, postmortem wrist wounds... blood loss speeds the decay of the organs. The result is, they can't be passed on again. I'm betting that this girl Davison... is the donor for all of our victims... Getz, Tattersall, and Emma. Emma is not dead. I heard back from Ned in Indiana. The latest victim was a heart transplant. If you'll excuse me, gentlemen... Emma. Please, it's Dr. Pierce. I've been trying to reach you all day. Emma, listen. The donor I talked to you about... her family is threatening to sue. Her mother had religious objections... to harvesting her daughter's organs... even though her daughter was a voluntary donor. I don't think they have a case, but... Are you listening to me? Her lawyer just called. She needs to see you. She needs to see how her daughter's cornea... has changed your life. Because it has, Emma. Whether you like it or not, it has. Where does she live? Is this Leslie's? You're Russian, you go to a Russian church? Yes. Um, Davisovich is our ancestral name. Where did Leslie work? Illinois Masonic... on Wellington. She was a nurse. No, thank you. I'll do that. I could probably get Miss Brody to come by. - What? - Emma Brody... the woman who received your daughter's cornea. She says you've written to her. No. I never heard of Emma Brody. Is this the place? Well, this is the right block... but... jeez, what a dump. He said that the Davisons were at 523 South Sawyer. Well, there it is. That's it. That's it? Now, wait a minute. We got to find a place to park here. OK, I'm gonna turn around up there... and park back there across the street. Oh, they've seen us. This is good. I'm gonna go. Hold it. Hallstrom said... never to take my eyes off you. I'll be on the porch. You'll see me. Now, wait. Hold on. Hold... Ah, shit! Hey, officer. Mrs. Davison. It's Emma Brody. Hello? Crowe, wait up! There's no one there. Crowe? Hey. Do you hear me or wh... Think of him in terms of Leslie... someone she might've known, someone who liked her a lot. You got something? I got an I.D. From an orderly. The guy's name is Neal Booker. - Neal Booker? - Yes. You know him? The orderly. He's so quiet... like he's not even there. - He working now? - I don't know. I think this could be Neal... if he were really angry and scared. Ridge, get down to personnel. Find out where this guy is. Your eyes are different, Leslie. They gave them to her. They're not the right color. They... they took the corneas. Just the clear window on top. The windows of the soul. I've been looking for you. In all of them. I... saw them... carry pieces of you away. I'm here. Put it on. You have 30 seconds. Leslie Davison was Emma's donor, correct? How did you get that information? She has something to do with the murders. Yeah, Leslie Davison is the donor. Emma's with her mother right now. Someone who said he was her lawyer... gave me the address. Leslie, put it on. You're so beautiful. Stand by for the all call. Stand by for the all call. Attention all units and all districts. I'm on South Sawyer. Can you hear me? Unit 12 proceeding southwest Harvard. ETA South Sawyer 3 minutes. You're not Leslie. You're one of them. You killed her to give you life... like that fat sow who had her heart... her little beating heart and all that f... Blind as a fucking bat, aren't you? I'm closer than you think. I could be right beside you... and you wouldn't even know. I'm coming. I should've just gone for her. I should've just... I should be with her. Help! Somebody! I'm in here! Help! I'm in here! Goddamn it! In here! Fuck! That's Leslie Davison. You guys go around back. Make sure everything's all right there. Looking for Officer Crowe. They can't hear you. You're dead. You wanted to be Leslie. Well, you weren't good enough. Somebody shoot that fucking car alarm. Say goodbye to the light, Emma. I'm taking back the eyes you stole. Goddamn it, no! Over here! Hold your fire! You all right? You all right? Sir, it's Crowe! Oh, Jesus Christ. Ms. Brody, come with me. Come on. Johnson, take the back. Watch your head. Look, I know all of this has been hard on you... and again, I just want to thank you for everything. I think we got enough now. Sure you don't need to go to the hospital? No, think I've had enough of hospitals... for a while anyway. Let me get somebody to take you home. I'll drop her off, lieutenant. Why don't you take this. Thank you. It's the gray one. I think I've got a ride home. Let me give you your coat. That's all right. It's OK. Thanks a lot. Ralphie. Hello, boy. How you been? What a good boy. Can I buy you breakfast? I know this great little diner. Sure. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, seeing as you caught the killer... I figured the least I could do... was write you some lyrics. So... There once was a dick from The Windy City Who met this great mick who was, oh, so pretty He told her goodbye... But he had no reason why... That's all I got so far. Well, I was soaked to the marrow I was chilled to the heart I took shelter in her room She called me from the corner Of a song I never liked For the occasion that was in there If I let you inside me Will you stay for long? The one and only While the gray wall crumbles Whatever you are Whatever you want One more time While the gray wall crumbles If I knew now What I knew then I'd run from these blues-soaked hills And I'd go back to the well And chew her white lipstick And her long, slow kisses If I let you inside me Will you stay for long? The one and only While the gray wall crumbles Whatever you are Whatever you want One more time While the gray wall crumbles I'll tell the keeper Bring us something else to smoke While we're naked and alone So they make us immortal So they make us a deal Will it matter when we're naked and alone? Such a beauty with a smile There'll be opportunity And abundance for all But if I let you inside me Will you stay for long? The one and only While the gray wall crumbles Whatever you are Whatever you want One more time While the gray wall crumbles If I let you inside me Will you stay for long? The one and only While the gray wall crumbles When you're an old lady And I'm still around We'll make love in ruins Make love in the strand
