WHERE THE WHITE MAN RULES AND THE OLD GODS ARE FORGOTTEN IN THEIR FRAIL CANOE THROUGH STORMS UNDER A BURNING SKY THIRST-CRAZED AND STARVING... ALWAYS DRIVEN ON BY FEAR... FEAR OF THE AVENGING TABU. The couple found in their wrecked canoe, as already reported, recovered quickly. The boy, it develops, is born diver, the best we have ever had on the island. But it seems only play to him. He evidently does not yet realize what money means. But the girl was stolen before the ship left Bora-Bora As the Government desires above all things to avoid conflict between the islands under its rule,... it demands the arrest of this man and woman wherever found. For their arrest, the Government ofers a reward of Five Hundred Frans. Et. Cadoustal . A most unfortunate accident happened today on the Lagoon. It occured while most of the people were ashore at one of their native peasts. There is a spot in the lagoon, the richest in pearl beds of any in the South Seas. But this spot is Tabu. Natives shun it. Today, one of our old divers defying the superstition. An enormous man-eating shark guards these pearls the native believe... Today's tragedy proves this is no superstition: the shark is there. I trust I have the Government's approval in putting up a sign forbidding further diving in this place.
