You carry too much now Miguelito's getting heavy. You shouldn't talk to the baby. - But I was only saying..... Yesterday they said on TV that a baby can hear everything when their in the womb. If it's a girl, she'll get confused. Then we call her Miguelina. What is that? - Open it. For ecografie. An ultrasound, stupid. - Exactly. Tano, what is it? Dona Flor is asking for you, Miguel. It's Carlos. Chino ... We want you to give Carlos' body to the sea. What about you? Isn't that your job as his brother? He would love it if you did it. And you have an edge with God. I don't want my brothers soul to find no rest because of me. No one has an edge with God. You have come to the coast You searched for neither wisdom nor wealth You only wanted that I follow you Sir This applies to anyone who will listen. I, Miguel Salas, stand for this church and parish ... ... to give my cousin Carlos Vela a proper burial. May our Lord have mercy on his soul. As we care for his body, God will have mercy on his soul ... ... So that it will not wander restlessly. Against the tide A skinny, drunk man came up and they asked him: What do you do for a living? The man looks at them and says: I make lollipops that you need to suck all night suck until I come. Quiet, Pato. The fairytale prince is there. Hector, from Santiago. - For me? Yes, in honor of Carlos. What is this? Is he your boyfriend now? No, Sabino, thanks. We were just leaving. You won't take them? - Then sit with us. Are you crazy? - Bunch of idiots. It's okay. We're still here right? I'm sorry about what happened to your brother. Really. Come on, damn it. To my cousin. May he rest in peace. Cheers. - Cheers. How are you? Come on. Carlos' life was no life, Mico. It's better now he's at peace. I'm worried about my aunt, Flor. It is difficult for her. Come. You're so beautiful. - You always say that. But you can't get enough, huh? Like this, huh? - Rogue. I'm tired of being nice to Hector. And that stupid Pato. Pato is a good man. It's just that he's an idiot. I just don't trust him. - You think everyone is like you. No, I rather think that everyone is like you. That's the problem. They're waiting for me. - Mico. What about going away? I can't now. My aunt needs me. I know. I'm not stupid. Can you later? I don't know. Mariela is almost due. So I had better leave. Then you can provide for your family and you don't have to worry about me. When will you come back? I don't know. But ... you will come back? Pastor Juan! The heart is strong. Very strong. The spine looks good. And now the question for 1 million soles. Let's see. What? What is that? What do you think? Good news. Come to the cemetery in 4 hours. It's a boy. No pictures, man! Enough. Why are you laughing? I've never seen you so happy. - You don't fool me. Really, I'm glad to see it. You're really going away? It's for the best. But you'll still come back? You tell me. Should I come back? You haven't broken my record yet. When you're ready. Ripe. Ripe. Ripe, juicy but not ready yet. It still needs a few days. You must learn quickly. Soon I won't be able to go. Try to find two that are ripe and juicy. What's this? - 10 Soles. Do I look like a tourist? - Good morning, Don Pepe. Hello. Put it on when the baby's born. It brings good luck. They say so, yes. I'll give it to him but tell him you got it from me. Why would you give me something? I don't know you. Well then. Santiago La Rosa. Mariela Ordnez de Salas. I don't care what I look like. I've got to go shopping. You look beautiful. What? What's so funny? I've not been called 'beautiful' in a long time. My father always said that but but here you never hear it. I didn't think you came from here. Why? As a child I came here every summer and I know almost everyone here. I had never seen you before. - I've lived here five years now. Don Pepe, can I have a bag? But do you know my husband, Miguel? He was born here. Yes, I know him. What do you think? Take it. - You don't need to give me anthing. Listen, I know what. You take the candle ... ...and in return I'll take a picture of you. What do you think? Do it now but... Don't ... Ana, pick it up. Ana, with herr favorite brother. Damn. I finally get through and then I get your voicemail. Call me back soon, before I lose signal. It's because ... I met her in the market and I spoke to her. It wasn't my fault. Honestly I felt shitty. Call me back, then we can talk here. I need cheering up. I love you very much. A kiss. Ciao. Damn. Thanks. Thanks for the egg today. It's Saturday. We can also do something simple like Vermicelli Soup You'd complain if you actually had to pay. Vermicelli Soup isn't filling enough. Be glad your people and your church can help. You see. She's always right. - Don't be silly. And this candle? - Guess who I got that from. Don Pepe? That old miser doesn't even give me a smile. From the painter. We need him to take a picture when Miguelito is born. I didn't know you were friends. - It's the first time I've spoken to him. Where are you going? I have to repair nets. Chino, it's Saturday. I've promised Hector that I'd replace him. It seems like you're the only one who does any work. - If I don't work, we don't eat. You're won't work so hard when Miguelito is born, huh? That's a good one. What is it? For me? Who else? Watch me. Watch me. - I'm curious. Damn, you seem to be an expert. I'm going to break your record. - Will you agree to four. Go fuck yourself. Not even three. Fucking rocks. Which do youu like most? - Are these all there are? No. You took one of me at the funeral. It's under my bed. Naughty boy. I said you shouldn't shoot me. I don't need to take pictures of you. I know your body from head to toe. I'll show you. It's really well done. You looked so serious when you were burying Carlos. You looked like a real leader. You have to take it seriously, otherwise his soul will find no rest. You really believe that story, huh? Wisearse. Don't spit into the sky, because it'll come back to hit you in the face. Terrible saying. They're good, but they were better last week. Have you suddenly become a connoisseur? Forgive me, Your Eminence. There's something for you. What is it? - Open it. I wanted to give it to you for the trip, but now you're not going ... What? I said I didn't want any gifts. You wanted a love. She thinks I'm fixing nets. What should I say? I found it in the sea? Don't be so stupid. -Hide it in your boat. You're certainly feeling very generous. The camera. The candle for Mariela. You thought I wouldn't find it? She wanted it very much. - I don't want you to give her anything. don't talk to her and stay away from her. I met her by chance. - I'm not interested in an explanation. You'd like me to be dumb and nothing more. Maybe you think that, but I don't. But that's how it should be. Really? Well if it should be so ... ...then I can go one better. Come on, Santiago. Wait. What about your paintings? You really are stupid. Do you really think I'm here because of them? I am here because of you, idiot. Now I've said it. Satisfied? I'm here because of you. You knew I had a wife and a child besides, I'm not like that. No ... You're a real man, huh? A real macho, huh? - So what? And what am I? Think what you want, but I see your face when we fuck. Fuck you. Go fuck yourself, motherfucker. Like every Sunday, we're invited to Miguel & Mariela Salas home ... ...to enjoy lunch for 1 hour. Because she's giving birth soom she needs help with the cooking. Tano and Jacinto have already offered their help. Give them a round of applause. And someone else has offered to help? Yes, yes. I will. You, Ms. Trinidad? - No, not me. My daughter. I told carlotta yesterday that I was looking for something to do lsaura. She's keeping quiet Not like the men. We love beautiful women like her. Always so nice. It would be good for her. She works hard and is a good cook. You'll be very happy with her. What do you think, Father? You must be relieved. Why? - Haven't you noticed? The photographer isn't there. He hasn't collected his newspapers from Pepe since Thurs. I see that you are well informed. I won't condemn anyone, but he's not a good example for the children. I don't think the painter is a bad person. He even gave me a candle recently in the market. You know what she said? "I think I like him. He gave me a candle. " Unbelievable. Now they're good friends. I don't like that man. Always taking photos, He's so quiet, always watching. Hopefully we won't stay long. He is here to paint, but I have never seen a painting. He's probably been thrown out of his house. It's obvious why. When he's that way. - Do you think the artist ...? Of course. I've seen him with magazines with naked men. What a shame. He seemed so nice. You woke me. Why are you sweating. What were you dreaming? - Nothing. Sorry. What are you doing here? Go away. don't ruin it for me. See? - Don't spoil it for me. Damn. Miguel? - Damn. Go away. You see me. Listen to me. - Go away. The current has me, Mico. - Did you catch much? Sabino said he needed 20 fillets for lunch. What's going on? Is everything all right? You look so pale. Sit down. Did you eat something bad? I make some hot broth for you. For my fishing Santiago Now you can take your own photos. Chino ... Cry, throw it out there. I'm sorry. That you've bottled it up for so long. What? You have to know that Carlos is now at peace. He's resting. "... In the sense that the darkness passes and the true light. " "Who says in the light and its brother hatred which is still in darkness. Whoever loves his brother remains in the light and does not fall. This is the word of God. - The Lord is praised. You're sweat. Chino, you're sweating. -Sorry. Are you okay? - Yes, it's just hot. I don't know what happened. I don't know what I'm doing here, but we need to talk. The Gospel according to Luke. Come-up. Bless the Lord. "If any of you has 100 sheep ... ... let him leave 99 behind to find the lost sheep? They're sleeping whilst they are still drawn. I found nothing. I think the Brazilian are best. - Those are great. It tells me nothing. My Carlos didn't like soap operas. He just watched football. Football, soccer and football again. Terrible. Miguel also doesn't like soaps, but he watches El Derecho de Amar. That's being repeated. - You must look Dona. For Lauro Corona. It's so good. - Really? Even Miguel says. What happened? - I don't know. I went into the sea ... ... The current took me to the rocks. And now nobody sees me. Nobody hears me. I want to leave, but I can't. It's like I'm stuck here. With you. I don't know what to do. It feels the same. Why am I here, Mico? We must give you to the sea. - Damn. I know it's ridiculous. We need to find your body and give it to the sea. Otherwise you will find no rest. I'll help, Tiago. I'll help you. Don't ask me to leave, Mico. I'm so unhappy. It's terrible when you are away. Nothing. Quiet. Why are you here? - I don't know. Do you sleep walk? No. The PA was good. The music sounded loud. Yes, Father Juan bought it. The music was good, huh? Pato brought the CD. Thank you for dancing with me. - You dance well. You know how to lead. Nobody can see you, huh? Except you. Tiago? How are you? - Great. I spent the whole morning frightening children. Come on. - Where? The street. - Wait. Come on. Nobody can see me. Come! You've a real temper huh? Tell that idiot you can't see me. See? No one sees me. Come on, fool. Miguel, come on out. You see. Nothing happened. Look what a beautiful day it is. Sitting outside. Let's go hiking. Onward. Relax. - Hi, Miguel. See? No one can see me. How was your day? Good? - Yes? Don't be so nervous. Relax. Hi, Miguel. - Hello. Jacinta. Good day, Auntie. Holy shit. I will raise you one and take two. Okay? He needs to have at least A flush. -That's what I'm afraid OF. He's bluffing. His cards are crap. You're lucky, Chino. And? Nothing. I've found nothing. The sea is clear. That will help. Why don't you? Where? - Here. With me .. I mean it. What is it? I've had a long wait to hear you inally say it. Previously we couldn't be together. Now though. I thought you were happy. I am happy when I'm with you, otherwise I feel fucked. Nothing. I promise ... - What can you promise me? Don't you understand? Look at us. Look! I know I can promise you anything, but I want you with me. Miguel. Wake up, Miguel. Pastor. - What happened to you? Nothing. -What do you mean 'nothing'. Look at you. Put your clothes on. I get it already Nothing, huh? - Sorry. I must have had too much to drink. What's wrong, Miguel? You never do this type of thing. -Nothing, Father. Really. You haven't been to confession for a while. - Because everything is going well. Are you sure? -Yes. Don't say anything to Mariela, please. - I don't like gossip. But you have to promise me that you won't get drunk or naked. The children might see you. He's sleeping. - You're exactly your father. The whole day sleeping. Sorry, but if you think of me, I come. What? - I thought I heard him. I'm so ugly, huh? Not at all. Why? -I don't know. You look very beautiful. Beautiful? What could have happened to the painter? How should I know? Nobody has seen him lately. - Maybe he left. That's weird, right? All his belongings are still here. You ever talked to him? No. Why should I? I thought you were friends. - Are you crazy? He's a friend of mine? Come on. I know a place. The body of Christ. - Amen. Well, I'm done here. I'm going to see if Miguel needs help. Mariela, I said nothing. Jacinto has spread the rumor. What rumor? - About the painting. What painting? Pato, where are the others? - No idea. They said they'd come. - Really? When? For the mass. - Maybe they're busy. What? They come here every Sunday? -Why are you asking me? I'm here, right? - Yes, thanks. Well, what's going on, Hector? Come on. Don't be stupid. It's not me. I don't know. I haven't seen it. Not necessarily. I'm not. - How do you know? I've never spoken to fucker. - Maybe he has a picture of you. You don't believe me, huh? Do you believe me? - I don't know, Miguel. They've seen you coming out of his house. -That is a lie, man. Listen, Miguel, if you're with that guy, that is your problem. But you have a wife. Show her respect, so that others will. You're father. You've got a child. Everyone says you're doing it with that guy. Even the women say it, and that makes me furious. Think of your wife, your family and what will happen to your child. Do you want your son to have a gay as a father? Motherfucker, I'm not a fag. You're a fucking fag. I know you're here. You never talked to that fag? Damn. I said you shouldn't paint me. It was for me. -The whole town thinks I'm gay. You're not gay then? And you know why? For that you must be brave and that's not you. Coward, you think you are a man because you have a wife and child. Shut up, damn it. In thousands of ways you can look like a man, but you are in no way a man. You thin you're a man? Who are you trying to fool? You're afraid to accept ... ...that you love me. I can't love you, Tiago. That's not true. Who says? Who says that shit? You do your best for them and then people behave like this ... ... they make up everything. She said it in passing. - The bitch. She gets more like her mother. Let them all go to hell. They won't see any tears from me. He's huge. I've known Miguel since childhood. A stupid painting doesn't upset me and it shouldn't upset you either. Yes, I know. I'm here, Mari. Relax. I am. I can't. - You can do it. Any later and you'd have missed it. -And so. Good. Very good. So it went well. Look. Hello, little one. Tiago? Wait. This is Miguelito. Hello. Bye, baby. He looks just like you, man. Now you're a dad, Mico. I'm gonna go get a pisco. We should celebrate. Of course. Sabino, a pisco, please. This one's on the house, Miguel. Congratulations. Congratulations, Miguel. - Thanks, Tano. Tonight our son was born. None of you came to see. What are you doing here? - To see you two. You're a beautiful mother. Come on. What's happened with Hector? - A stupid quarrel. He clearly thinks otherwise. He hasn't even come to visit. I beat him too hard. I'll apologize. Don't worry. I'll get home early. - Chino. What about that painting? I don't know if it exists. I never posed for this guy. Why do they say ... -How should I know? Damn, who do you believe? - You, so I'm asking. I wasn't with this guy. I swear on Miguelito. No, don't swear on him. Never. Do you understand me? Never. "If a little of that of me is seduced by sin ... ... it would be better to put a millstone around my neck and thron it into the sea. If your hand causes you to sin, chop it off. It's better to go throuh life maimed, than go to hell with two hands ... ... where the fire is inextinguishable. If your foor entices you to sin, chop it off. You're better to go through life lame ... ... than be thrown into hell with two feet. Miguel, what is it? It's ... What is it? Was it true? Forgive me, Mari. Get the fuck out, don't cry. Mari, please ... So I'm not. I swear. Nothing happened. And he's gone now. I swear that What is it? This can't continue. I found the body. But I didn't want you you to float away and tied you up. And now it's gone. I didn't want this. I'm an idiot. Everything was going so well. I thought I could make everyone happy. And now what? I can't do it any more. I have a son, Tiago. I gotta give him a family. I want to ask you one more thing. Don't call me anymore. Don't find me any more. Promise me you'll let me rest. Good evening. Dona, sorry that I come so late ... - She doesn't want to see you anymore, Miguel. I know. Is she well? - What do you think? How's Miguelito? - He's a saint. Please tell Mariela I'll be at home waiting for her. They're long overdue. -Go home. I will tell them. Thank you. We need time to think. -I have nothing to think about. I want to be with you. Even if you don't believe me, it's true. What do you want me to do? What would you do? I wouldn't do what you did. I thought so, too. I only want what's good for him. Come inside. If I hear that one of you has been saying something about my husband again ... ...I will scratch your eyes out. Have a nice day. Pato. Pull, man. Go fuck yourself!. Mariela? - Hector! And Miguel? - He's inside resting. Let him sleep. - I just want to talk to you. Goal! - A long shot, man. You've had bad luck all day. What happened? No-one hurt. It's a bunch of horseshit. We had to set a sea lion free from the nets. And? Ready to play against your master? Please wait. I gotta pee. -Damn. Isaura, what do you want? Nothing. Say what's on your heart. It wasn't a sea lion. It was the body of a man. His face was unrecognizable, but everyone knew it was the painter. Pastor Juan has blessed the body and they're looking for his family. The body laid-out at the doctors until someone arrives to claim it. Why are you telling me this? If I don't tell you, no one will I thought you'd want to know. Well, now I know. Hear that? That's the sea. I'm here when I'm not here. You see how beautiful it is? But you know who's even more beautiful? Indeed, you. You are the finest in the world. Yes, I know. Where were you? - Outside. So late? -We were looking at the sea. Didn't he cry? With you he never cries. You make me jealous. You probably hungry. I'll warm it up. His body was found. You knew that, huh? I want him buried. Pastor Juan has arranged everything. Tomorrow his family pick him up. He did 't care about our traditions. He surely wouldn't ... But he did. If I don't, he'll find no peace. Do you think they're going to leave their wealthy son here ... -I 'm gonna try. I owe him that. -And Miguelito? You're his father. I doing it for him. -don't be selfish. So that he can respect his father. And learn to be a man ... ... If I myself am not a man. - How will he know how to be one. Let them take him. In a few years everyone will forget. But I will remember and so will you. Why does everyone have to wallow in your shit? Mari, this is the last thing. I swear. Again you're swearing? Do what you want, but I won't watch. Where will you go? - We'll see. And Miguelito? - I will take him. You still love him, huh? I'll come to you soon. I promise. Finally, Miguel. I've come for the body of Santiago La Rosa. I want to give it to the sea. Do you still have it? -They've already collected it. Who? - His family. They're collecting his stuff from the house and then they're taking him away. What? - You have no business here. What do you want from here? He is a good painter, huh? I don't know. I've never seen any. He was careful with his work. But you still, you've posed for him? - Me? I can't pose. I swear I never ... - Don't worry, Miguel. He told me about you. He called me one time and said that three was someone. I said nothing. I didn't even asked your name. I didn't know what to say. I pretended I hadn't heard. Since then he never spoke to me about you. He still called, but we never talked like we used to. He said that he painted because of you That he had this sensitivity because of you. Madame.... I want to ask a big favour. It's not for me but for Santiago. He wanted to be buried here. In the sea. I've come to ask your permission. Thank you, but we'll bury him alongside his father. You know he was happiest here. Mama-... You know that Santiago ... - I came to fetch him, and I intend to do it. He wanted to make sure that you got this. Thank you for coming. Madame. My wife is going to leave me, maybe forever, and take our son. She will leave me because I'm here and I want to honour my promise to your son. Santiago wanted to be buried here. If I don't, he will find no peace. - Do you know what you're asking me? You know it's not my request. I want you to support him ... ...and to accompany him. Are you sure? Do it for me. Isaura. Shall I help you? - Are you sure? This applies to anyone who will listen. I, Miguel Salas, stand for this church and parish ... ... In order to give a proper burial to the lifeless body of Santiago La Rosa. May our Lord bless this ceremony.... ... so he will be merciful unto Santiago. As we take care of his body, God will care for his soul ... ... Not so that he no longer wanders restlessly... ... but will rest in peace.
