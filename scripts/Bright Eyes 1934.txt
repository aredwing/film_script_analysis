How'd you make out, Loop? Did you get your passenger there on time? I got him there just in time to see his wife. Have you seen Shirley around anywheres? No, not yet, but she'll be here. She always is when you come in. Where are you goin'? I'm going to the airport. ZJump in. I'll give you a lift. Thanks, mister, but I'll have to get a faster car. I'm in a hurry. You're the most particular hitchhiker I ever saw. Well, thanks, anyway. Hello, Shirley. Goin' to the airport? Yes, thank you. Come on, hop in. That-a girl. Hello, Loop. I bet you wish you were up there with him. I will be someday. Contact. Contact. Ha ha ha! Come on. Contact. Ha ha! Hiya, Loop. Hiya, Bill. Check the oil when you gas it. Yowzuh. Come on, honey. Up you come. There. Hello, Shirley. - Hello, honey. How was it, Loop? - Hello,Jack. A little bumpy over the hills. Are you off again? Sure. I'll be eating my Christmas dinner... in New York tomorrow. Well, Merry Christmas, Shirley. Merry Christmas and lots of tailwind. - Ha ha ha! Thanks. - So long. You wait here, honey. I'll be right back. - Hiya, Tony. - Good morning, sir. Hello, fellas. - Tony. - Yes, missy? You didn't dust my daddy's picture. Here, missy. You givin' your daddy a clean face? Yes. Don't you think he needs it? I think you do, too. Here. Wet. There you are, young lady. Come on. My daddy could fly better... than anybody in the world, couldn't he? That's right- better than anybody in the whole world. You know, your daddy and I were pals... ever since we were about as big as you are. He was my best friend. That's why I'm your godfather. And then one day, he cracked up... and went away to heaven, didn't he? That's right. I'll bet when I'm a flyer, I won't crack up. When you're ready to be a flyer... we're gonna buy you a great big noncrackable ship. Say, that reminds me. I found an old scrapbook... the other day with some pictures of your daddy and me in it. - Would you like to see it? - Oh, yes! I'll get it. - Hi, Harry. Grab some of these, will you? - Sure. Hello, honey. Hello, little boy. I'm not a little boy. I'm a little girl. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Well, I just didn't want to take any chances. Now, that's mistletoe. And when you hold it... over anybody's head, you can kiss them. Beat it, you chiseler. OK, kid. Move over. There's your daddy on the day... he broke the transcontinental record. And there's your daddy and me when we first got our wings. We'll skip that. Wait a minute. There ought to be... another one in here someplace. Who's that? A girl I used to know. She's a pretty lady. I used to think so. But it's not enough to be pretty here. You've got to be pretty in here, too. How can you be pretty in there? By thinking the right thoughts... and doing the right things... and eating plenty of spinach. Ha ha ha! Say, we better call up your mother... before she starts to worry about you. She won't worry as long as I'm with you. Fledrich 4230. Good heavens. Will no one answer the phone? Hello. May I please speak to Mrs. Blake? Mary. Mary. Yes, ma'am? The telephone- for you. Thank you. Hello? This is Loop. I just wanted you to know that Shirley's with me. Hello, Mother. I'll have one of the boys drive her home later. All right, Loop. Thanks. Mary. Yes, ma'am? I don't approve of all these telephone calls. I'm sorry. And I don't approve of all these aviators... who keep coming here to see your little girl. She's sort of a pet with them. They all knew her father. I know that, but I really can't have it. You know it isn't everyone who'd engage a maid... with a small child. I have no fault to find with your work... but if you want to stay on with us... you'll have to correct these things. Yes, ma'am, I will. Very well. I told you when you engaged her... that it wouldn't work out. Well, she was so pathetic about wanting a nice home... for her little girl... that I let my sympathy get the better of my judgment. I'll let her go right after the holidays. Hmm. Fine. Ah. Through with the upstairs already? Yes. What's wrong, dearie? Mrs. Smythe doesn't want me to have any more telephone calls. She don't? Well, well, now, ain't that too bad. Ha! Her and her highfalutin ways... and him that finicky. They both give me a pain. Tut tut, Elizabeth. I shall not stand here... and listen to you defame our employers. What? Besides, I have to go down to the post office. Ha ha ha! Don't forget to pick up those things. What things, my love? Don't you remember? The things I told you to get? Oh, you fool, you. The sewin' kit I told you to get for Shirley. Oh, right. I wanted it to be a surprise. I guess it won't matter if you know. ZJust a bit of a Christmas gift. You're awfully kind. Aw, go on. I bought a few things for her. Not very much, of course. It was different when her father was alive. Oh, yes, the poor young fellow. Well, it must be a comfort to know... you're doin' the best you can for the little one. She's a sweet child. Not like that young one of theirs. There's a brat if ever one lived. Now, darling, don't get yourself all excited. Child: I don't care! No! No! No! No! No! Darling, you must practice your piano lesson. You won't have to practice again... until after Santa Claus has been here. There ain't any Santa Claus! Don't say "ain't," darling. Say "isn't. " Ain't! Ain't! Ain't! What's all this noise about? Mother wants me to practice, and I don't wanna! You must do as Mama says, dear. Well, I ain't gonna! Now, look here, young woman- Remember what the psychoanalyst said- The child mind must never be coerced. One must use persuasion and reason. Now, darling... practice your lesson, and mama will buy you something nice. What? - Anything you like. - Anything? Yes, dear. What would you especially like? A machine gun! Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat! That's a good girl. ? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3? ? 1, 2, 3, 1? ? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3...? Hey! Is there anybody at all in this confounded house? ? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3? ? 1, 2, 3, 1? Hey! Somebody! Anybody! Come and help me downstairs! Hey! ? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3? So you think you're gonna make me stay up here today, do you? Well, I'll show you. ? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4? Oh! Doggone it! Why, Uncle Ned! Why didn't you call us? Call you? I yelled, and I shouted and bellowed. A fat lot of good it did me. No one pays any attention to me. No one cares what happens to me. All you do is think of yourselves. Oh, Uncle Ned, you know that isn't so. Mary. Yes, Mr. Smythe? My name is Smith! His name is Smythe. Yes, Mr. Smith. Didn't you hear me holler a little while ago? No, sir, I didn't. Folks around here had better get their ears fixed. That's all, Mary. ? 1 and 2 and 3 and? ? 1 and 2 and 3 and? ? 1 and 2 and 3 and? ? 1 and 2 and 3 and... 1 and 2 and-? Stop it! ? 1 and 2 and 3 and? Is that all you know? Mama! Mama! Mama. Mama. It's a good thing I'm not your mama. Why, it's enough to drive a man crazy. Things better be a little different around here... or you're gonna see the last of me. And another thing- You stop telling people... I made my money in sanitary engineering. It was sewers! Sewers! And don't you forget it! And, oh... How much longer must I stand this? Now, now, dear. Be calm. That horrid man. He's just impossible. Yes, I know he's trying, but after all... we can afford to be patient. It will pay us in the end. Any money he leaves us we'll have earned. Yes, that's true... but with my business in such condition... we'd better keep on humoring him. And, Mama, every time he sees me, he makes a face. Never mind, darling. Well, I must be getting down to the office. - Good-bye, dear. - Good-bye. Good-bye, darling. Never you mind, darling. Don't you let him worry you. Sit up. Sit up. - Ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha! Miss Blake's car is ready, sir. Very good, Meadows. The royal chariot awaits, madam. Come on. Ha ha ha! Bye, Ray. I'll see you later. Bye, honey. Bye. Hello, Harry. Hello, Shirley. Hi, Shirley. Hi. Hello there. Mr. Higgins? Yes, madam? See that? That's mistletoe. Thank you, madam. - Mother. - Yes, darling? May I help you with the dishes? No, honey, but I tell you what you can do. Take this down to the incinerator... and leave it there. All right. Higgins, what's that on your face? My face, madam? Yes. It appears to be chocolate, madam. Look out for the police car! Here comes the police car! Everybody, get out of the way! Everybody, get out of the way! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Why, you poor little thing. You must have cracked up. You should be in the hospital. Hey, that's my doll. Well, I just found her here. You can't have her. You bad old thing. You ran away from home... and I'm gonna spank you. If you give her to me... I'll take care of her. I'll wash her face... and make her some clothes and everything. You can't have her! You wanna know why? Because I'm gonna kill her. ? Happy, happy, happy days? ? Happy days, happy days? ? Happy days, happy days? ? Happy days, happy-? Hey, what are you gonna get for Christmas? I'm gonna get a doll house with real furniture... and a little piano and a tennis racket... and a great big doll. I asked Santy Claus to bring me a doll. Santa Claus? Pooh! There ain't any Santa Claus. - There is, too. - There is not! There is not, because my psychoanalyst told me. There ain't any Santa Claus. There ain't any fairies or giants or anything like that. I'll bet you'd feel bad... if you woke up tomorrow morning... and you didn't have any presents. Well, I won't. You want to know why? 'Cause I already peeked in the closet and saw 'em. I don't care what you saw. There is a Santy Claus. There ain't! Mr. Smith? Huh? There is a Santy Claus, isn't there? What did she say? She says there isn't. Then there is. You think you're smart, don't you? Well, I'll show you! You'll what? You'll... Aarrrgh! Get outta here! Go on! Get out of here! Go on! Get outta here! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Shirley. Shirley, where are you? Here I am. Oh, well, my goodness. We got rid of her, all right. Thanks, Mr. Smith. Oh, that's all right. I like you. You're the only one around here that does. They don't like me... and listen, I don't like them, either. I made the arrangements... and everything's all set for tomorrow. It's wonderful of you and the boys... to give Shirley her Christmas party. Oh, we're getting a big kick out of it ourselves. She'll be so surprised. She doesn't expect much, you know. Now, get her down to the airport... as early in the morning as you can. I may not be able to come with her... but I'll be down just as soon as I can get away. That'll be fine. Hello, Mr. Merritt. Merry Christmas. The same to you. I'm just after making myself a cup of tea. - Will you have one? - Sure. Ah, fine. Hello, Loop. Hiya, honey. All ready for Christmas? I've been ready for a long time. Hello, Loop. Hiya, Thomas. All ready! Come on. Yes, dear, I think Friday will be all right. That will be fine. Very well. We'll make it definite, then. Thank you so much for inviting us. Good-bye, dear. This is good cake. It ought to be. I whipped it up myself. How are you, Mr. Merritt? The compliments of the season to you. Same to you, Mr. Higgins. The cup that cheers but not inebriates. Ha ha ha! Wow! That's hot. - Ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha! Higgins. Yes, madam? My cousin's arriving from New York tomorrow... and I want you to be sure... that everything is done just right. Yes, madam. - Thomas, you will meet the plane in the morning. - Yes, ma'am. I'm very anxious to show her that we can do things... exactly as well out here as they do in the East. I want perfect meals and perfect service. Is that understood? Yes, ma'am. - And, Mary... - Yes, ma'am? I hope you'll remember what I told you... this morning... about visitors? Yes, ma'am. And I don't want to have to remind you again. Remember that, Mrs. Higgins- Anything else than perfection... and, ggkktt... off goes your head. My head, indeed. You better look after your own. How can you stand working for people like that? Oh, I don't mind. Could be worse. Well, I guess you know your own business best. Now we'll have a little pepper. Good-bye, Mrs. Higgins. Ah-choo! I'll see you tomorrow. OK, Loop. Hello, dear. Mother, I undressed myself. I put my clothes away- all folded and everything. Well, you're mother's precious little angel... that's what you are. No, I'm not, because angels have wings... like these. Those are your daddy's wings. I know, and he's really an angel, isn't he? Yes, darling. Now, then. Are you all ready to hang up your stocking? - Mother. - Yes, dear? You know, I was thinking today... - about hanging up my stocking... - Yes? and I thought maybe... if Santa brought me a great big present- of course, he mightn't- but then if he did- Yes, if he did? Well, you know, my stockings are awful little. I know. And you want mother to lend you one of hers. Oh, no. I already borrowed one of Mrs. Higgins'. Oh, you did? Ha ha ha! See? It's a real good, big one. Santa Claus could get most anything in that. Shall we hang it here? Will it hold everything without falling down? I think it will. Now... say your prayers. Then mother will tuck you in... you'll close your eyes and go to sleep... and then- And then it will be Christmas. That's right. Now, there you are. Dear Lord, please bless my mother and me... and Loop and all of the aviators... and Mr. and Mrs. Higgins... and Mr. and Mrs. Smythe and Mr. Smith- Do I have to ask him to bless Joy, too? Yes, dear. And bless Joy, too... and make her a good girl. - Mother. - What, dear? On account of this is Christmas Eve... do you think it will be all right... if I ask something special? I'm sure it will. Dear Lord, please see my daddy... and wish him a merry Christmas from my mother and me... and tell him we love him... forever and ever. Amen. Mother, do you think he will? I think on this night of all nights... God will listen to the prayer of a child. Don't cry, Mother. I get lonesome for him sometimes, darling. Don't be lonesome, mother. You have me. Yes, my own sweet baby. And we're together... and tomorrow's Christmas and everything. And it'll be a merry Christmas, won't it? The merriest we've ever had. The very, very merriest. All right. Beddy-bye. In you go. 1, 2, 3! There you are- nice and comfy. Tell me again about the first Christmas. All right. A long, long time ago... three travelers came to an inn. And they needed food and shelter. Yes, but there was no room for them in the inn. And the only place they could find to sleep... was in the stable. In the straw... with the cows. And there was born that night... a little baby boy. Isn't it beautiful, dear? Merry Christmas, Uncle Ned. Ohhh... Oh, look, darling. Look, darling. Isn't she nice? I don't want any old doll! I wanted a wheelchair like his! Little girls don't have wheelchairs... but you have lots of other nice things to play with. I don't want anything else! I want a wheelchair! Ohh... Look, Mrs. Higgins! Look what Santy Claus brought me! Oh, my! My! Isn't she pretty? What's her name? Her name is Mary Lou... and Santy Claus brought me... a little man that dances when you wind him up... and a ball and some candy... and a sewing kit... with real scissors, a needle, and everything! Santa Claus was certainly good to you. He certainly was. I got every single thing I asked for. I'm pretty lucky, all right. All right, honey. Roy's outside waiting for you. Now, you run along and see Loop... and mother will be down just as soon as she can. Run along, dear. Are you gonna take Mary Lou to the airport with you? Do you think maybe she's too young? Perhaps you'd better leave her here. All right. Take good care of her while I'm away. I certainly will, darling. Hello, honey. Hello. Up you go. You hurry down, Mother! All right! Hello, honey. Hello, Thomas. That plane flew all the way across this country... since yesterday afternoon. And it made a 3-point landing, too. That's right, honey. Now, you stay here with Thomas. I'll be right back. Check your baggage right inside. Hiya, Paul. We're expecting you at the club, you know. Swell, Loop. I'll be there. Everything all set? Miss Martin? - Yes? - I'm Thomas, the Smythe chauffeur. I was sent to meet you. Oh, yes. Take care of my bags, will you? Yes, ma'am. You wait here, dear. I know who you are. You do? Sure. You're the lady... who's coming to live at our house. Well, you're not littleJoy, are you? Oh, no. I'm Shirley. Ha ha ha! Oh, I see. Come on, honey. Loop. How are you, Miss Martin? Isn't she the lady... whose picture you have in your book? Yeah. She's one of them. You see that? That's all for you. For me? - Surprise, honey! - Surprise! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Oh, my! Do you like her? Oh, my goodness! Ha ha ha! You'll have to give her a name, Shirley. What are you going to call her? Her name is going to be... I know- Loopy! Ha ha ha! That's a swell name, honey. I'll meet you, Loop, uh... you know. Let's go, gang. Now I've got a present for you. This isn't from Santa Claus. This is from me to you. That's a magic ring, see? ZJust like they have in the fairy tales. Now, if ever you're in trouble... or ever you want me to do anything for you... you send me this ring, and I'll come. It's pretty. Thanks, Loop. How much do you love me? Is that all? - Mmhh! - Ha ha ha! I wish Mother would hurry... so she could see all I got. She'll be here. We're just beginning. I do wish that man from the bakery... would get here with the cake. He's sure to be here in a few minutes. I don't want to miss any of the party. No, of course you don't. Mary, where's your little girl? She's gone to a Christmas party. I don't believe in Christmas. You don't? No. It's a lot of nonsense. Well, I don't feel that way about it. Well, I do! Here- Buy a Christmas present for Shirley from me. Christmas! Ugh! Now, what do you make of that? He never fooled me. He's only tough on the outside. Inside he's soft as mush. How 'bout it, Loop? I wanted to wait for Mrs. Blake... but I guess we better get going. When she comes, give me the flag... so I can stop and take her on. OK, Loop. What are we going to do? I've got it all fixed... for you to have your party in the big ship. Are we going to go up? No, but we're gonna taxi all over the field. Won't that be swell? Oh, boy! Come on. We want Shirley! We want Shirley! We want Shirley! Have a good time, Shirley. - Yay! - Yay! Surprise! Surprise! Hi, Shirley. OK, Loop. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Turn on the radio, Bill. If I close my eyes... I can make believe I'm really flying. Now I'm way, way up. I wish mother was here. This is the candyland hour... for all good children. The orchestra will play our theme song. You know that song, don't you? - Sure, I do. - Well, then sing it. Come on. Come on, Shirley, sing it. ? I've thrown away my toys? ? Even my drum and trains? ? I want to make some noise? ? With real-life aeroplanes? ? Someday I'm going to fly? ? I'll be a pilot, too? ? And when I do? ? How would you? ? Like to be my crew?? ? On the good ship Lollipop ? It's a sweet trip to a candy shop? ? Where bonbons play? ? On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay? ? Lemonade stands everywhere? ? CrackerJack bands fill the air? ? And there you are? ? Happy landing on a chocolate bar? ? See the sugar bowl do the Tootsie Roll? ? With the big bad devil's food cake? ? If you eat too much? Ooh! Ooh! ? You'll awake with a tummy ache? ? On the good ship Lollipop ? It's a night trip, into bed you hop? ? And dream away? ? On the good ship Lollipop ? On the good ship Lollipop ? It's a sweet trip to a candy shop? ? Where bonbons play? ? On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay? ? La la la la? ? Lemonade stands? ? Everywhere? ? CrackerJack bands fill the air? ? And there you are? ? Happy landing on a chocolate bar? ? See the sugar bowl do the Tootsie Roll? ? With the big bad devil's food cake? ? If you eat too much? Oh! Oh! ? You'll awake with a tummy ache? ? On the good ship Lollipop ? It's a night trip, into bed you hop? ? And dream away? ? Dream away? ? On the good ship Lollipop? ? Mmm pop? ? You'll awake? ? With a tummy ache? ? On the good ship Lollipop? ? It's a night trip, into bed you'll hop? ? And dream away? ? On the good ship Lollipop? Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Well, you're here at last! Yes, ma'am. I want you to see it. Here you are. Thank you, ma'am. Merry Christmas to you. Ohhh! Oh, ain't that pretty? Why, it's far too nice to eat... if you ask me. I'll save a piece for you anyway. Now I must dash. - Here, I'll hand it to you. - Thanks. Well, good-bye, now. Good-bye. Bye. Have a good time. Look out! Aah! That man was on the wrong side of the road. He was going too fast. Why don't we get the doctor? Do you live in town here? Yes. But she ran right in front of me. I didn't even have a chance to put on my brakes. Why, it's Mary! You know her? Yes. She works for the same people I do. Come on, let's take her over to the curb. Give me a hand. Who was it? It was Mary, our maid... the mother of the little girl you saw at the airport. Ohhh... Fare, please. I paid you already! Oh! So you did! Ha ha ha! Hey, Loop, look! Hey, Bill, hold it a minute. What's the matter? I've got bad news for you. Well, what happened? There's no use breaking it to her right now. I'll tell her later. I can't say thanks, but... I want you to know I appreciate you... coming down here to tell me. Wouldn't you let me go along? If you don't mind... I'd rather be alone with her. I understand. Honey? How much do you love me? Mmhh! Mmm. I'll never forget this day. It's the best I've ever had in my whole life. Good-bye, Shirley. Had a swell time... at your party. - Bye, Shirley! - We'll have another one soon. Swell dance. Good-bye, Shirley. We have to go back. So long, Shirley. Bye. Is it all over now, Loop? No. They have to go back to work... but we're just starting. Now, because today is Christmas... you can do anything that you want to do. What would you like to do best of all? You know. Fly. That's just what I thought. Hey, Bill. All right, Shirley... we're goin' for a ride... just you and I. You mean way up high? Yep... way up high. Come on. Ooh! We're going up! That's right. We're going way up. Do you know where we're going? No. We're goin' right up to heaven. - We are? - Mm-hmm. You know, Shirley... heaven's a very nice place. If we're good, we'll all live there someday. Yes, I know. My mother and father are there now. So is my daddy. We're up pretty high now. Are we getting near it? We're right in it now. It's all around us, everyplace you look. It must be a awful big place. It is, honey. Shirley... I've got somethin' to tell you. A story? No, not a story. You know... ever since your daddy went to heaven... your mother's been awful lonesome for him. Yes, I know. Sometimes she cries and everything. Well... today your mother got so lonesome for your daddy... that she went to see him. All the way up to heaven? Yep. All the way up to heaven. They're up there together now. You mean... my mother cracked up, too? Yes. Would you take these off for the little girl? I think I would. What's to become of her now? I don't suppose the Smythes will do anything for her. Oh, not them. They're far too selfish. - Elizabeth- - Huh? No, we couldn't do it. Oh, how I'd love to have her. She's such a sweet child. But if we took her... we'd have to give up our place here... and it mightn't be so easy gettin' another one. That's what I was thinking. Well, I've checked up. As far as I can find out, there are no relatives. Now what are we to do? There's nothing for us to do. It's no concern of ours. We have neither a legal nor a moral responsibility. I know that, but after all, the woman worked for us. People will naturally expect us to do something. Maybe one of those aviators... would like to adopt her. Well, if they do, let them go to court. All that we can do is to see... that the little girl is placed in an institution... where she'll be cared for. I'll speak to judge Thompson about it. Oh, no, you won't! Oh. Uncle Ned! Did I hear you say you were gonna put... little Bright Eyes in an orphan asylum? Who? Shirley. Bright Eyes, I call her. I don't care what you call her. Well, now, Uncle Ned, you see, uh... Anita and I have talked the matter over... and we've decided... that since there are apparently no relatives... and since of course... it's impossible for us to keep Shirley- Why is it impossible? Well, really, Uncle Ned, you could hardly expect us... to raise our littleJoy with the child of a servant. Servant, my eye! She was just as good as you are. I don't know where you get the idea... you're so high and mighty. Why, your father was a retail butcher! And your father started life as a bricklayer! Why, really, Uncle Ned... you-you mustn't get so excited. Well, I will if I want to. Now, listen to me, you two. I want you to understand just one thing. If you ever expect to get anything out of me... you're going to be human enough and decent enough... to take Shirley into this house to live. I'll pay for her board and her clothes. Oh, that wouldn't be necessary, Uncle Ned. Of course, Uncle Ned. We had no idea... you felt this way about the child. Well, I do... and if you don't want her here... I guess I can find some other place for her. And listen... I can find another place for me, too. Well, this is going to be perfectly lovely. Well, you engaged the woman against my advice. I told you not to do it. Are you blaming me because the woman died... and left a child on our hands? I'm merely pointing out- Well, don't bother pointing anything out. Uncle Ned? What do you think? I think you're an old softy. Well, would you let them put a child like that in a home? In my home. You're not like those two in there. You're more like me. Where's Shirley now? She's down at the airport with Loop. Loop? Who's Loop? Oh. He's that aviator fellow you were interested in. Yes. Uh-huh. Well, uh... you go down yourself and bring her back. I'll go right now. Whrrr! How was the trip to Ensenada? Terrific. I didn't have a minute to myself. I'm gonna sleep from now on. Hey, Bob. That's right. Come on. We're goin' to San Francisco right away! Oh, boy! How'd you like to make a livin'... flying a guy like that? Don't squawk. He could've said Paris! Ha ha ha! Whrrr! Watch, Loop. I'm gonna bank. Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! We should've had our belts on. You didn't make a bank. You did a barrel roll! Now, always remember one thing- If you bank too sharply, you're liable to go into a sideslip. That's what I did, all right. I went into a sideslip. Oh, you! May I come in? Hello. Hello. How are you, dear? I'm fine, and I'm glad you came to see me. Come on and see Loop. What can I do for you? I want to talk to you... privately. Shirley, run over to the radio room and see... if the American Airlines ship is on time. Why, it was on time when we asked a while ago. Well, then, uh... run over to the hangar... and find out if they've gassed my ship. Well, I know they did because I watched them. Come on, take off, will you, please? OK. Whrrr! Well, you might ask me to sit down. I might. Why are you so bitter? You ought to know. Can't you forget the past? Sure. I can forget a lot of things. I can forget that you and I were in love... and we were engaged to be married... and that you walked out on me. All that is just as dead as this. But I can't forget that you made a fool of me. A man usually remembers that. Would it make any difference... if I said I'm sorry? Not a bit. It's a little too late. You didn't come all the way over here... just to tell me that, did you? No. I came to talk about Shirley. What about her? The Smythes want her to come and live with them. Now I'll tell one. - I mean, Uncle Ned- - Wait a minute. You mean you and Uncle Ned sold the Smythes the idea. They don't like it any too well... but in order to keep in good with Uncle Ned, they'll do it. Is that right? You're being very unfair. Nothing doing. You can't have her. Don't let your feeling against me... interfere with the little girl's future. I know her father was your best friend. I know you love her very dearly. If you do, you must surely see that she can't live here... in a barracks with a lot of men! They're pretty good men. Even so, if there was ever a time... when a child needed women around her, it's now! Oh, I know she can't stay here... but on the other hand, I'm not so sure... the Smythes are the right people for her to be with. But I'm going to take care of her myself. - What about when you go east? - I'll take her with me. Oh, no, you won't. Anyhow, I'm figuring on getting a house... and hiring a woman to take care of Shirley. But that'll take a little time, won't it? Oh, I suppose so. I'll tell you what I'll do. You can take her for now, but only with the understanding... that when I get a place for her, Shirley comes with me. I love that baby. I understand how you feel. And, Loop, no matter what you think of me... I think you're the finest man I've ever known. There was a time I thought you were pretty swell, too. Say, Loop, American Airlines ship is- Oh, now I forgot whether it's four minutes late... or four minutes early. Never mind. Come here. Honey, would you like to go back... to the Smythes' house and live there? Do I have to? For a little while, dear. We think you should. Are you gonna be there? Yes, I am, and we'll be together every day. If you're there, it'll be fine. I like you, and I like Mr. Smith, too. All right. Then it's all set. Can Loop come live with us, too? Oh, no, dear. ZJust at the moment... I'm afraid that can't be arranged. Oh, no! Not a chance! Here, Rags. Here, Rags. Come on. I'm gonna let you take Rags with you, too. Oh, goody! Good old Ragsy. Thanks, Loop. Oh, that's all right. I might as well give the dog a break, too. Don't worry about her. Come see her whenever you like. Much obliged. So long, sweets. If you don't like it there... remember what I told you about the magic ring. Send it to me... and I'll come and get you. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye, Loop. Come on, Ragsy. Do you have much trouble... with your little girl? Oh, no. She's very good. She sleeps all the time. Well, I have to spank mine every day... and give her castor oil. Now,just listen to her. She's crying again! Stop crying! Stop this minute! They seem to get along all right. Why, of course. Anyone could get along with Joy... but I still think it's a dreadful imposition. I know, but, uh... it won't last forever. What do you mean? Well, we can humor Uncle Ned for a while... and then later on, I can convince him... that the child will be better off somewhere else. Shirley is just one of his whims. He'll get tired of her one of these days. I hope so. Well, ladies... taking your children out for an airing? I'm taking my little girl to the hospital. She's very sick... and I'm afraid she'll have to have an operation. Huh. Is that so? Yeah. They'll probably have to cut her leg off. Maybe both legs. And what's wrong with your child? Nothing. She's fine. The only thing about her is... she just won't eat her spinach. Well, we must be going. Come, Shirley. Let's play hospital. I'll be the doctor, and you can be the nurse. I'll get a big knife out of the kitchen... and we'll operate on your doll. I don't want Mary Lou to be operated on. I don't care. You have to do as I say... and play the way I want to. - I don't, either. - Yes, you do. This is my house and my yard... and you're nothing but an old charity. - I am not! - Yes, you are, 'cause I heard my papa tell my mama. Let's do something else. Do you want to play a game? What kind of a game? Train wreck. How do you play it? I'll show you. You stand right here and don't move. All right, now, don't move. Here comes the train! Woo woo! Aah aah! Mama! Mama! Shirley pushed me! What's the matter with that imp? She's a very difficult child. Difficult? Huh! I can think of a better word. Uncle Ned, I think you should speak to Anita... about the way ZJoy treats Shirley. No use talkin' to her. I got somethin' better up my sleeve. What? You'll see. Well, it's your move. Uh... you only got one move. Ha ha ha! There you are! Look at that! You give up? What was it you wanted? I don't know whether you know it or not... but I'm Shirley's godfather. - Oh, is that so? - Really? So naturally I want to do the best I can for her. Yes, of course. When you wanted her to stay here and live with you... I thought it would be a good idea. I knew you'd be nice to her. It isn't hard to be nice to such a sweet child. I'm glad you feel that way... because Shirley means more to me than anybody else... in the world. That's why I thought I'd come and ask you- Yes? I want to take her to live with me. And I hope you'll let me have her. What's that? Hey, what's all this? Why- Let me explain, dear. You're that aviator fellow, ain't ya? That's right. I don't like airplanes. Well, I don't like wheelchairs. Well, you stay in the airplane business... and you'll wind up in one. What's he doin' here? Well... you see, Uncle Ned... Mr. Merritt thinks it's a good idea... for Shirley to live with him. What?! He wants to take Shirley away from here? Are you married? No, I'm not. How much do you make? Enough to support myself. Where do you live? At the airport. Where do you eat? In restaurants. You've got a lot of nerve, young fella. How can you take care of a child... when you haven't got a home or a wife or even a cook? Well, maybe I've got something else she needs. - What? - Love, that's what. Aw, fiddlesticks! We all love her here, don't we?! Yes, Uncle Ned. Well, you can't have her! - Who says so? - I say so. I've got more right to her than you have. Aw, nonsense. You haven't any right at all. Well, we'll see about that! Hey, young fella! If you want to see about it... you see my lawyers! Lawyers? Lawyers? That's what I said. Lawyers. I'm taking legal steps to adopt Shirley. Good heavens! So that's where he went yesterday. You can't get away with this! Oh, I can't, eh? No! I'm gonna give you a fight! I'll get lawyers myself! We'll let the court decide! Is that so? You haven't got money enough to fight me! I'll get it. I don't care if you've got $90 million! You're not gonna take Shirley away from me! Ha! I've got the best lawyers in the country! Ha ha ha! Loop! You put one over on me again, didn't you? No. I didn't. I didn't know about it. You expect me to believe that? Yes. OK. Loop, from now on, I'm on your side. Why? Because if Shirley means so much to you... then you're the one who should have her. For a child, love counts more than anything. ZJust for a child, huh? For anyone. I'm glad you found that out. There, now. Pleasant dreams, dear, and go right to sleep. I don't want to go to sleep... but I'll try. That's a good little girl. Good night, Shirley. Good night, Mrs. Smythe. And remember, Shirley... I don't want to have to speak to you again... about having that awful little dog in your bed. It isn't healthful. And besides, I think the dog has fleas. Oh, no. He hasn't got fleas. He just scratches that way because he's itchy. Well, I don't want him here in this bedroom. Is that understood? Yes, ma'am. Good night,Joy, darling. Hey! What? Do you want to play burglars? No. I want to go to sleep. Come on, Rags. Ooh! You've got that awful dog in your bed... after mommy told you not to! I'm gonna tell. Mama! You don't have to yell for your mother... and you don't have to tell her, either... you old tattletale. I'll take Rags downstairs. Come on, Rags, good old dog. I thought about it and thought about it... and I'll be hanged- Pardon me, dear- if I know what to do. The minute I heard him say he'd seen his lawyers... I felt a cold chill go down my back. He may have changed his will. He may have left us out of it entirely. Oh, it's intolerable. Yes, you're right, dear... and all because he took a fancy... to a 5-year-old orphan. There's been nothing but trouble... ever since that child came into this house. I wish we'd never seen her. If you'd only taken my- Now, don't tell me again that it's all my fault... for hiring the woman. All right, dear. Well, what are we going to do about it? If we could find some way of getting rid of the child. Heaven knows she's not wanted here. Why don't you bribe that aviator fellow... to take her out of the state? Now, that's an idea. But what would Uncle Ned think? Oh, I don't know. I'm so sick of hearing that child's name, I could scream. She's practically disrupted the family. I know, dear. But we've got to find some way out of it. Say, what's a three-letter word... for Peer Gynt's mother? What's the matter, Loop? You low? How could I make some money? What for? Well, I gotta hire some lawyers. Why don't you marry the girl? Cut out the wisecracks, will you? I'm serious. I don't know, Loop. Flyers never have any money. You know that. Yeah, I know it. Wow! What a night! Heavy weather, huh? Terrific. I hear everything's on the ground. Nothing moving. That's right. Zero zero all along the line. Boy, oh, boy. Hello, everybody. Shirley! What's happened? Shirley, what are you doing out... on a night like this? Why, you're soakin' wet. Come on, now. You gotta get those clothes off and dried out. Hello. Hello, honey. Hello, Shirley. Are you all dressed? Yes. Did you dry yourself off good? - I did. - OK. Ha ha ha! You sure look swell. They fit you fine. Now, then... what's the big idea? I don't want to live with the Smythes anymore, Loop. I want to stay with you. I want you to stay with me, Shirley. And I'm gonna try and fix it so you can. Oh, goody! Now, then... off you go to sleep... and we'll talk everything over tomorrow. You're not mad at me for coming here... are you, Loop? Yes, I am very, very mad. Ha ha ha! Come on. Ha ha ha! ? Ohhh? ? He flies through the air? ? With the greatest of ease? ? This daring young man? ? On his flying trapeze? ? Well, his movements were graceful? ? The girls he would please? ? This daring young man? ? On his flying trapeze? Well, good morning, Anita. Good morning, Uncle Ned. Good morning,John. Good morning, Uncle Ned. Beautiful morning, isn't it? Do you feel all right, Uncle Ned? My boy, I never felt better in my life. Tony! I sent him out for some breakfast, Loop. What's the matter? Aren't you workin'? Not today. I'm no hero. Aw, it's not that tough, is it? Ladies and gentlemen, here's news of national import. Two mail planes are reported missing... in the worst storm the West has known in years. A blizzard is raging over the Rockies... which has completely disrupted rail and air traffic. All transcontinental passenger planes... have been ordered grounded until the weather breaks. That's 30 for this morning. This is Sam Hayes speaking. I'll see you tonight at 10.00. Good day, all. I'm ready for breakfast now, Loop. I was gonna have some chow brought down... but I guess we'll have to go and get it. And then, young lady, you're going to have to go home. Oh, Loop. Why can't I stay here? Can't you be a soldier and stick it out for a little while? I don't want to. You don't want to live in a swell house... go to a nice school, and be educated and refined? I don't want to be refined. I want to be like you. All right. Let's eat and talk it over. Now, come on. Bundle up warm. Well, children, I want you to know... that I'm about to change my will. I'm adopting Shirley... and I'm setting aside a trust fund for her. What? You two have nothing to worry about... so long as you behave yourselves. Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! - Shirley's gone! - What? Yeah! She didn't sleep in her bed all night... 'cause I woke up and looked. She must've run away! She wouldn't have run away without some reason! Did you have anything to do with this? Why, of course not, Uncle Ned. She's gone to that aviator fella! Get police! Get detectives! Get the army! But go to that airport and bring her home! Yes, Uncle Ned. There'd better be some action around here now... I'll tell you that! You see, honey? Man's just learning what the birds knew all the time. What? You never saw birds fly in bad weather, did you? They have too much sense for that. Listen. Am I working for you, or you working for me? I'm workin' for you. Well, then you listen to me. This has gotta be in New York tomorrow. It means a lot of money to me. You're gonna fly it there. Not me. What do you mean, not you? I mean the weather's too bad. There won't be one ship take off from here today. - It's too dangerous. - You don't understand. This has got to be in New York tomorrow. That's all I know. Well, I'm sorry, it can't be done. I've got a wife and two children... and they mean more to me than this job. You mean I gotta get someone else? You sure do. All right. You're through. I'd give $1,000 for this flight. There must be someone around that wants that kind of money. You won't get anyone to fly today. Well, that's my worry. I'll find somebody. Oh, my! Come on! Come on, Rags. Who's Loop Merritt? I am. You fly to New York for me? Not today. They told me you were a flyer with plenty of nerve. Nerve is one thing, and being crazy is another. Anybody who takes a ship up today is crazy. There's $1,000 in it for you. I could use 1,000, all right. Mister, you got a bet. This has to be delivered in New York tomorrow morning. Leave the check in the office with Major Moseley. I'll do that right now... and I'll meet you in my hangar in 10 minutes. You're not really gonna fly today, are you, Loop? I sure am. Don't be crazy. You'll kill yourself!. Didn't you ever need money so badly... you were willing to risk your life for it? Sure, but on a day like- I know, but I need $1,000, and I need it for a good reason. No one should fly in this weather. I fly better in weather like this. Eddie, come here. Take Shirley home, will you? Sure, Loop. So long, baby. Be a nice fella and wait till I get back. I'll wait right here for you. Oh, no. You have to go home. No. I'm never going back there. Aw, Shirley. I'm making this flight to get money... so that I can take you and keep you with me always. But for now, you'll have to go back to the Smythes'. Won't you do that for me? All right, Loop... but hurry back. You wait in here out of the wind, honey. I'll be right back. So long, Loop. Lots of luck. Why don't you call it off, Loop? Nothin' doin'. Hey,just a minute! Where's Shirley? Don't tell me you're worried. Never mind the funny stuff. If you've got that kid... you're in a tough spot. Well, wise guy, I haven't got her. I sent her home. She'll be at your house before you get there. You sent her home? Yes, I sent her home! You know I could have you arrested for kidnapping. We'll take that up at the next meeting. So long, fellas. - Well, where is she? - Isn't she here? - She is not. - She ought to be. Sure, she should be, but she isn't. Are you a detective? Yes, sir. Well, I'm not, but if I was one... I'd figure out where she is. Now, Mr. Smythe- Smith's my name! You know what I think? I didn't know you could think! I think that aviator took her with him. He was going on a flight when we got there. Say, that's right! You say he was goin' away? - Yes. - Sure, he's got her! He's taken her with him! Call the police! Call my lawyers! Now, take it easy, Uncle Ned. Ah, get out. Hurry, man! Hurry! Have them in a moment, Mr. Smith. Hello. This is Hall speaking. I want to report a kidnapping. I'll spend $10,000- Anything to get her back safe and sound. Burbank, Burbank. Zero zero. Dense fog. Zero. Temperature 50. Dew point 50. Barometer 29.80. Winds west 3. All airports have been asked to notify police... if plane NC13843 lands. The pilot,James Merritt... is suspected ofkidnapping Shirley Blake... 5 years old. Ha! Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Shirley! Come here. How did you get in here? I got in where the baggage goes. Don't be mad, Loop. This is the first time in my life... I ever felt like spanking you. Didn't you tell me to send you this ring... if I wanted you to come get me? That's right. Well, I was going to send it... but I couldn't get it off, so I brought it myself. See? You certainly picked a fine time to do it. Now, what's the idea? I want to be with you, Loop. All airport offiicials have been asked... to report the arrival of plane NC13843. You know, we're really in trouble. Loop, you're not awful mad at me, are you? Yes, I'm very mad at you. Well, I guess I won't be very long. That's right. But be sure... and keep me posted if anything happens. Well? There isn't any news. I blame you two for this. If you hadn't been so selfish... if you'd just been a little kinder... that child would never have left here. You people have everything to make life worthwhile- youth and health and money. And yet you were too mean and too narrow to share it... with a little child who had nothing... but who had more than you'll ever have. Well, if anything happens to her... I'm through with you for good and all. Is it always bumpy like this? It isn't bumpy till you hit your head on the top. Say, reach in my pocket and get a stick of gum. Isn't this great? Uh-huh. Give me half. Say, what was that "Lollipop" song? Go ahead and sing it. ? On the good ship Lollipop? ? It's a sweet trip...? ?... Bonbons play? ? On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay? NC13843 calling. NC13843 abandoning ship. Broken gas line. Approximate position- Can you hear me? It's dead. What's the matter, Loop? Do you love me? Of course, Loop. How much? Oh, you can hug me tighter than that... 'cause we're bailin' out. Hold tight. Are you all right, honey? Sure! Let's do it again. And in conclusion, your honor... my client feels that he is the best qualified... and most fit person to have the custody of this child. He therefore prays... that you grant him the right of adoption. ZJames Merritt. Yes, your honor? Aren't you represented by counsel? No, sir. Well, you've heard all about the advantages... Mr. Smith can give Shirley. What have you to offer? Not very much. I haven't a lot of money, and I haven't a fine home. But I love Shirley, and I know she loves me. I'd do anything in the world for her. Judge: Come on up here by me, Shirley. Up she goes. Yeah. Well, looks as though you... are a very popular young woman. Now, it's my duty to decide who is going to adopt you... but I think you should have something to say about it... don't you? Yes, I do. Now, uh... which of these people would you like to live with? I'd like to live with him. And I'd like to live with him, too. And her, too. Well, it seems to me that this case... can be settled without attorneys. Will all the lawyers in the courtroom please leave? Now, suppose we adjourn to my chambers. Come on, dear. Oh, not you, Mr. Merritt... nor you, Mr. and Mrs. Smythe. I just want to talk to Mr. Smith and the young lady. Mama, do we have to have... that old Shirley living with us again? Darling, please, be quiet. But, mama, do we? Shh! Shh! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Well, Mr. Merritt... I've been making some inquiries... and I'm not so sure- Would you please step in here? You told Shirley if she was ever in trouble... to send you this ring. Well, I want to see if it's really a magic ring... because I'm in trouble. You want Shirley... and I want Shirley. If you think hard for a minute... can't you figure a way out? I don't get you at all. Oh, dear. Do I have to propose? Well, I did the last time. Oh, Loop. No. You don't have to propose. Maybe all this happened for a good reason. And this time, it'll last forever. Well, Uncle Ned, who got Shirley? We did. Come up and see us sometime. Oh, Papa, now we don't have to... be nice to Uncle Ned anymore!
