Wasn't it locked up? - The third time already at the office. - The third time? - I'll get a battered up one. For once buy a decent bike now. I'll go with you. How much do you want to spend on a bicycle? - 800 SEK I think. - 800? You really don't care about it? What are you thinking of... You're crazy. You just don't want to move. All units, apparently shots fired at Bondegatan. Do you have a house number? The ME is currently somewhere else. Do you have a house number? Number 7. No siren. I know where that is. - Do you know the entry code? - I know someone who lives here. Did you call? What did you hear? First shot, then another pair. It sounded like it came from above. - Right over here? Thank you. - Go inside... - Andersson, you guard the stairs. - Go inside and close the door. - This is 1617. - We're outside. Okay. Bring the tools with you. Police. Open up. Julia, it's me, Nina. David? David, open up. David Lindholm? You're not supposed to be here. No, but we were in the neighborhood. Break down the door. Gunshot wounds to the head and lower body. Understood. Stay at the scene. There should be a boy here as well. Come here. Good morning. Wake up, Kalle. Good morning, Ellen. Nina? What happened? Police and crime expert, David Lindholm, was murdered. No details were released. It is unclear how Lindholm was killed and if there's a suspect. Lindholm gained fame after a hostage taking at a nursery school in Malm. He was also featured as an expert in "Crime Map Sweden". Home and twelve pages. And pictures of the crime scene, his house, his career. Patrik's gone to the police for more details. Annika, you do the personal side. Relationships. - His wife wasn't questioned. - It won't be long. The on-line version of Bladet casts a lot of aspersions her way. - We're no better. - I'm not the web editor. I just spoke to them. The police won't say anything. Go on with it. The prosecutor may say something. Take a photographer along. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Nothing yet on the boy? - No. - Who's doing the search? - I don't know... - I want to go. - Is it really? I want to go on searching. - Hi. How are you? - Well, you know. Great. How is it you were first on the spot? Andersson and I were in car 1617. We were the closest. Of course. It was a coincidence. Just a fluke. Who wanted to take Julia to the hospital instead of into custody? - I did. - On what grounds? She may have had internal injuries. She seemed to be in pain. Good. - Good job, Nina. - The press conference's starting. Take it easy. I'm Angela Nilsson, I'm heading the investigation. Today we arrested someone for the murder of David Lindholm. The defendant will be arraigned on Sunday. Considerable evidence was collected on site. This morning David Lindholm was found dead at his home. A second victim was taken to the hospital. But our priority is to find his four year old son, Alexander Lindholm. Alexander lived in the apartment, but wasn't found. We're looking for information about Alexander and his whereabouts. I'll now turn over the floor to the police. In Sweden, officers are rarely killed. Here that's seen as an attack on society. No effort will be spared to resolve this issue quickly. Today we lost a respected colleague. David Lindholm was also a well-known public figure. He was an example for everyone, both inside and outside the police force. A shot to the head, three in the groin. - Shot in the groin? - I think that's revenge. - Who told you? - Sadermalm police. - Patrik, sometimes I think I love you. - The weapon belonged to Julia Lindholm. She's at the police station as well. Try to find out more about the shooting, the crime scene. Who heard what? Did they fight? And I want pictures. I spoke to Julia's parents. They're shocked, but the father's willing to talk. Super. When can we speak to Julia? Is she still in the hospital? I'll find out. You cover the boy. Where was he? Did he see the murder? Have they hidden him somewhere? And I want pictures. - Course. - Good. Photos, photos, photos. It's just unbelievable. Julia's our only child. Alexander's our only grandchild. Did you speak to Julia today? We tried, but we were too busy with all the reporters. Nina couldn't say much. Only that she was being interrogated. - She wasn't seriously injured. - Nina? Nina Hoffman. Julia's best friend. She's in the police too. She's the one who... She was first on the scene. - She worked with Julia? - They met at the police academy. Did you know David well? He always worked a lot, but we were proud of our son-in-law. - Were they happy? - We'd never seen anyone happier. Nina Hoffman? It's Annika Bengtzon of Evening Press. I wanted to ask you about... A thorough search will be conducted. Check the neighbors, shops and along the route to the nursery. Who will? Fine. Jonsson will give you the details, then you can get started. - Are you Nina Hoffman? - Yes. I have a job for you. Julia's been taken into custody. - Try to get something from her. - Through an interrogation? Call it what you want, as long as she talks. - I'd prefer not to. We're friends. - Exactly. Tells us nothing. Do it for Alexander, Nina. I want you at the arraignment to answer questions. - I don't want to be involved in the case. - You are already! Annika, you want the children more often than every week. - That's right. - You don't punish me through them? - Everything is always about you. - I asked you nicely, not for forgiveness. Silence now. Annika, answer my question. Yes, I want more time with the children. I've taken care of them for eight years. Thomas never did anything except iron his tie to impress a counselor. - And he left them for his mistress. - No, I left you. That's something else. Who's the most appropriate caregiver? Sophia and I, we're two adults with permanent jobs... Or a single workaholic, obsessed with crime? - You're talking bullshit. - I want shared custody. Was that it? I have a meeting. Hello, sweetheart. Mama, not so hard. Hello, sweetheart. - How are you? - Perfect. Do you want to see a trick? With the left. Hey, that's good, say. Bladet has the kid on the front page with the hot line number. Fortunately we have both stories. Nice work with the grieving father. That scores points. - Is there any news about the boy? - The police are still looking for clues. - They are looking, but they say nothing. - That depends on whom you speak to. - And his wife? - In custody. Dig into that. - That is the "where and how". Now the why. - I'll get that today from the police. I want an article about David Lindholm. - The arraignment. - Annika. Officers mourn. An officer with a heart. - He was a paragon of virtue. - Yes, he was praised. - Like when Thore Skogman died. - He wasn't murdered. By his own wife. She thought differently about him. - Why does a woman kill her husband? - Self-Defense. - Exactly. Patrik, keep that in mind. - You're not bitter, huh? Bengtzon's Women's shelter's opened. New identity and everything. "Take a number". That was a low blow, even for you. Julia, I'm... - How are you? - That dirty witch has him. - She's gone into hiding. - Has someone taken Alexander? Alexander, come out now. It isn't fun anymore. Who's taken Alexander? It isn't fun anymore. Officer, state the charge. We want to accuse Julia Lindholm of murder. And ask upon conviction at least two years imprisonment. We also request Julia Lindholm no be released on bail. - And the defense? - We oppose detention. There isn't enough evidence to hold Julia Lindholm any longer. In addition my client claims another woman was in the house that evening. - What does the prosecutor say to that? - There were no signs of forced entry. - So that's highly unlikely. - Your final word? I repeat my client fully denies the indictment. But should the request of the prosecution be granted... would like my client to be psychologically examined. Arraignment in Room 8 is open to the public. Then there's the matter of the accused's son, Alexander Lindholm. It's possible the disappearance is connected to random events. But if Alexander Lindholm isn't located quickly... I will include murder or the boy's abduction in the indictment. Calm. Calm down. Julia Lindholm, sit down. Calm. - My baby... - Can a nurse come? Are you Nina Hoffmann? Annika Bengtzon, Evening Press. I'd like to talk to you. Do you have time? Not here. I knew things weren't going well, but not that it was so bad. - What was it? - She had postnatal depression. It's like she never got over it. Or actually it began when she met David. What was it? He was manipulative, he controlled her. He wanted to know everything she did. He was very jealous. Even of our friendship. Julia and I could never meet without him being there. After a while she didn't dare do anything without asking him. - Did he hit her? - No, but... He locked her in the house. Once for an entire week. - He was constantly philandering. - Did Julia know that? You sense such things anyway? That isn't always the case. - Did you know? - Everyone knew it. So she had a motive. - Do you think Julia's guilty? - I don't know. But I do know David Lindholm was an asshole. The truth must come out. - Can I quote you? - Absolutely not. - Then I'll be screwed. Understand? - I need something concrete. Talk to Human Resources. Good day. Do you have the employee ID number? Let's see. No, that's wrong. Let's try this. - Hot today. - Certainly. Have you found anything? Here. What charge do you want to see? - Are there more than one? - Two. - Then I'll happily like to see them both. - Bear with me. I'm a bit clumsy here. All those new features. You have so many steps. You'd think it would be easier. Let's see. - Berit Hamrin. - Guess what I've got here. Two indictments against David Lindholm for assault, in the middle '90s. There were two drug addicts who withdrew the indictment... Because they said they wanted to outwit the police. One of them is dead, I got a message the other has left. - Can you try to figure that out? - Of course. Names? Tony Berglund and Timo Koivisto. - Koivisto is your target as you say. - No problem. Last week, Alexander told his teacher they went to their summer cottage. The keys are under the doormat. And the water is turned off. I thought... I can't sit idle. Should I go searching with some friends? We know the area like the back of our hands. That's a good idea. I'll see you there. Mercury, Venus... - More planets? - Earth... You know that off by heart. - What is it? Are you tired? - She has nightmares. What? - I don't know. - Don't you know? Shall we rent a movie and get some popcorn? Seems that you don't like? Maybe a pizza there? With ham and extra cheese. I want ham. - Annika Bengtzon. - Timo Koivisto, here. - I want ham and... - I'm glad you called back. Can we meet somewhere? Now? - That doesn't work for me. - It's now or never. I'm leaving town. - How long are you going away for? - At least two months. I don't know. - You found it. I'm Timothy. - Annika. Hi. What are your names? - Kalle. - Ellen. Welcome. For a long time I wanted to go to Vietnam. Since the '70s. - Wasn't this training center? - Yes, but now it's a treatment center. I've done this for fifteen years. It's my life's work. Can children just watch TV? No, but they can stay there a bit reading or drawing. I love talking about David Lindholm. I owe everything to him. Before I met him my life sucked. I used and dealt drugs. Then I began to sell adulterated drugs so I could buy more for myself. I kept some money back. I thought I was smart. And then I met David Lindholm at central station. - Do you know what a drum solo is? - No. I won't dwell on it now, but I still see double. And I'll carry this remembrance for the rest of my life. - Why do you like David? - He gave me a warning. I had to know they knew what I was doing. So David Lindholm worked with serious criminals? Drug barons? Yes, and his buddy Bure too. Christer Bure. I heard he's still in the police. - And Tony Berglund was abused? - Yes, indeed. - Why did you press charges? - Don't you understand that anyway? And yet you're grateful to David Lindholm? Before you meet God, get acquainted with the devil. Why did I get a warning and not Bojan? - Easy. - I'd be careful. Don't touch me. I'd be careful. - I've killed men like you. Beware. - Yes... Let's go. My apologies. What do you mean quiet? Oh, dear. That's nothing. Sweetheart... It's the weather? Come, let's go home. With this weather, I'd like to stay and search all night. The boys are good too. But I need more people tomorrow. Foot patrols, dogs, any help will be welcome tomorrow. Thank you. - An old junkie? - He isn't a junkie anymore. What a dreamer. So Lindholm and a senior police chief worked for drug lords? - You must have watertight proof. - I understand. This is waterproof as two pairs of rubber boots. We may publish the charges, but they were withdrawn. Officers are often accused of abuse. But not indicted twice. We can be sued for libel. He constantly philandered, and David abused his wife mentally. If we knock David Lindholm off his pedestal to divest, and the police chief... That can surely happen. But we're not there yet. - Do you mind? - No. I have something on Lindholm, but I can't just find out what. Eve, Berit Hamrin here, reporter for Evening Press. I'd like to talk to you. Please call me at 070-2997320. It seems your officers were engaged in other matters. - Look at that. - Well damn. Hello, Berit Hamrin. I've been trying to reach you. As soon as possible. Preferably yesterday. That's fine. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yvonne, Annika Bengtzon of Evening Press. I'd like to speak... Johanna Ahlberg didn't finish police academy. She seems to be his assistant. - What for? - Lectures. I met with her. Yvonne Nordin, his accountant, didn't want to speak. - What a bitch. - Certainly. She was there from the beginning. If there was money laundering, she'd know. - Who is that? - Anders K. Svensson. He's disappeared. But Bertil Oskar Holmberg something's bound to turn up. Yes, go after it. Johanna Ahlberg, his assistant. - What did you get to know David? - The police academy. He was looking for someone to help with lectures, appointments and things like that. - Did you ever stay in hotels? - Sometimes. Did you have a relationship? Yes, we had a relationship. - Did it last long? - Slightly longer than a year. But he couldn't get away from his wife. It was complicated, he said. They had a child and she wasn't alright. I understood why. What do you mean? When our relationship was over, I was broken. I meant nothing to him. He ruined a big part of my life. Bertil Oskar Holmberg, CEO, was found dead in a park a few years back. - He came, saw and died. Murdered? - No, it wasn't a crime. - Hepatitis and liver failure. - He was an alcoholic. - CEO of a nonexistent company. - Convicted of any kind of fraud. So Lindholm and Bure brightened things up... and paid Holmberg to serve as CEO... And to take the blame? - What do you say? - More or less. - What do you mean? - None of those companies went bankrupt. - But the whole structure... - Great, you know. I see the headline already: "David Lindholm perhaps not all he seems". - When we win the Pulitzer prize. - We have Lindholm's ex. She says that he abused her mentally. She told us that in confidence. - We've just been working one day. - Quiet. - You said you had talked to her. - Listen, everybody. Annika Bengtzon of Evening Press. I'm looking for Christer Bure. He was good friends with David. I want to show the reader how he saw David. Do you see, this is Bure's. And a beach house and a Jaguar. - And Lindholm? - A house in Malaga, a Lexus SUV. On his police salary? Then they certainly eat very economically. Were you good friends with David Lindholm? Yes, we knew each other a long time. From police academy. We were in the Norrmalm detachment together and the ME. We've always been colleagues. Then we became friends. - And you had a company together. - That's correct. We organized sky diving. - Sky diving? - Yes. Interesting. We also dealt in associated equipment. Helmets, harnesses, parachutes. It was David's thing. He got me involved. He was pretty much obsessed. - And Yvonne Nordin, the accountant? - I didn't really know her. She helped us with the finances of course. She also helped a few other officers. We aren't really good with numbers. - You stopped. Why? - We didn't have time for it. It's simple. We were busy with our real careers. David married, started a family and wanted to relax a little. - So he stayed home? - That's correct. He changed. David was twice charged with assault. Did you know? - Where did you hear that? - So you knew? It was slander. His name was cleared. - Did he do that often? - Nonsense stories? Yes. Did he have an aggressive nature? Who said that? Nina Hoffman? - I have read the charges. - Excuse me, but... - May I ask what's your real intention? - I wanted to find out... - David Lindholm was my best friend. - Not all details are consistent with his image. I think we're done. - Would you like to comment on these allegations? - I want you to leave. - In addition to the charges I haven't anything. - And you? I have the nursery. One week before the murder, Alexander was ill. Julia had no contact with the other parents. The children knew nothing. They made drawings. An empty... - We understand that already - We can do the following: A page about Lindholm's enemies. It's not front page news... But we can fill pages 8 and 9. And something about the indictments. Do that. Darlings. - Did you have a nice day? - Hello, Daddy. Just go and play. I want to talk to mom. Are you crazy? You can't take them along to a pair of drug addicts? Are you insane? What were you thinking? Are you crazy. It was my only chance to speak with him. I have to accept this year. I don't want that for the children. What did they say? I talked to them and they said there wasn't anything. If you continue like this, I want full custody. Good job, everyone. Good day. Good day. See you tomorrow. - Do you want to continue? - If you don't mind. Who's this? - What did it look like? - It was gray... With thin and thick stripes. It was a kind... It was gray with black stripes. With such... Berit's article was great. What would they have done to that child? - Do we know? - What about your conspiracy theories? I have the address of their accountant. I want to interview her. Seems nothing. Find something better or drop it. And let Berit continue. - What? - I'm not blind. I don't let my two best... most moderate staff write about a junkie. He isn't a junkie anymore. - It's about Heaven Sky Diving. - No comment. You can remain anonymous. I'm writing an article about Lindholm and Bure. Did Bure threaten you? - She's terrified. No wonder. - Why? - I think there were threats of violence. - To scare you? Yesterday I got a lot of phone calls, but there was nobody on the line. And someone was watching me when I took my children to school. - I'd tell Schyman. - But what if I was just imagining? - Maybe it was Bodin who called. - I'd completely forgotten about that bastard. - Maybe he's on the hunt again. - Wasn't he treated? The last time he called me from the treatment center. - I recognized his breathing. - Yes, of course. He has a deep, rich voice. A little special. Talk to Schyman. I have to go. - The annual reports are on your desk. - You're an angel. Why are you sending these people home? - We have been here for three days. - So? We scoured the whole area. We have to consider other possibilities. If we send everyone home, we'll never find him. - Nice. - Hands off. I wondered what you all did when we write articles. - Good luck. - Thank you. Say, Karl is his second name? Karl Jingert is in prison for economic crimes. Previously he was known under the name Anders Svensson. But you already knew that, right? Really? I want a bottle of whiskey. Not the 12 years trash. Annika Bengtzon of Evening Press. I'd like to speak to Karl Jingert. Annika, they've found something. Where's Berit? She's not there, but I can go. - Now. - Soon. This discovery concerns Alexander. - What then? - I can't comment on that. - Does it support the murder theory? - Yes. - Hi. Would you like to talk with me? - No. - Can you tell me what was found? - Please, he was my godson. - Have you seen Kalle and Ellen? - No. - Where are Kalle and Ellen? - I think they're all gone. - Since when? - I'll check in a moment. Who picked them up? - It was a while ago. - By whom? - Louise had already gone and... - You don't give them to strangers. How terrible, how awful. Annika, here. The children weren't at the nursery. I think something's happened. Please, Thomas. Call me. Kalle, Ellen, stop. Sorry. Mommy, what are you doing here? How you get it into your head to just pick up my children? - Thomas had a meeting, so I... - What's going on? - Why didn't you? - I was confused with the days. - You said it was your day. - I said you had checked. Didn't you check? I really said Sophia. I can't help it, you can't communicate. I'm sorry. - I made a mistake. I'm sorry. - Come with me. Think about this next time you call me a workaholic... or lung out at me when I take them on a job. Then you'll understand. Come on, guys. - Why were you so angry? - It was a misunderstanding. I was worried when I saw you weren't at school. - You sounded angry. - That's because I was scared. - So you weren't angry? - A tiny little bit. I've had a busy day. But everything's now okay. - What happens now? - They'll keep looking, but... They're now concentrating on a dead body. - I'm busy with my normal work. - Call me if... Drive carefully. Good day. Nobody thinks Alexander's still alive. That isn't realistic. - Do you understand what that means? - He's alive. She has him. I've read the report. The other woman you describe... - She looks very much like you. - Go away. What you have done, I'm your girlfriend. - I joined the lawsuit as your friend. - Go away. Get out. You all know Evening Press published an article about David... Describing him an aggressive, unreliable man. A murdered policeman is slandered. They involved me in their accusations. I'm afraid one of us spoke to Evening Press. A policeman. Someone from this office. In fact, someone in this room. We all know this work can lead to your death. It can happen to anyone. You can be stabbed by a junkie or... The point is: Our only certainty is we always support each other. And even if we no longer want to... we don't stab a colleague in the back... Then we might just as well quit. I ask myself why would anyone say something? Or about the entire group? This team can't continue until we resolve it. I'm not leaving until I have the name. Nina? Do you have something to tell us? Did you talk to Annika Bengtzon? What do you think about that? What made her do that? Danne, what do you think? I think it sucks. Good. That was it. Put your coat down here and empty your pockets. Arms up. Finally a beautiful sight. There aren't many women. And none of them compares to you. I'm doing an article on David Lindholm. You owned a company together? - Yes, that's right. - Heaven Sky Diving? Was Christer Bure also involved in it? What was your role in the company? I helped build the company. I acted as a financial advisor. How did you know David? He knew my name from a mutual acquaintance. - Who? - That's my business. I heard David and Bure had connections with the underworld. With drug lords. If I say their company laundered money for criminals... What would you say? Are you saying that isn't true? I'd say I want to continue living after I get out. Are you in here because of Lindholm and Bure? - You'd like that headline, huh? - It wouldn't be bad. To tackle them, you must find an officer prepared to open his mouth. You'll never find one. But you can give me something so I can continue. Christer has a boat in the harbor at Bjrkudden. Keep an eye on that. Maybe you'll see some interesting people. Such as? - Do you want me when I get out? - Do you have names? Well? Will you come with me when I get out? No. - May I speak to Christer Bure? - I'll put you through. - Christer here. - It's Annika Bengtzon. - I don't want to speak to you. - Karl Jingert worked for you and David. He's been convicted of economic crimes. How do you know him? Jingert talked about Bjrkudden harbor. Bure has a boat there. According to Jingert we'll notice some interesting people. That is. Don't say you're not suspicious. We have Bertil there taking pictures. - My name isn't on the roster. - Sit down, Nina. - What is it? - There's a strong opinion here. Currently several people no longer want to work with you. - Who? - Your colleagues. - What? - All of them. - It'll blow over. - It's because of that article, huh? That's helped, yes. But that will blow over. - How are you? - Good. - Are you sure? - Yes. Don't you feel you're going crazy? What about with your personal hygiene? I'm sorry, Nina, but I must ask. What about your personal hygiene? A number of colleagues say you really stink. And so they don't want to work with you. They say you smell up the car. And their clothes stink of you. Who's crazy now? Who's crazy here now? I don't know. Or do you? Take some time off. At least do it for us. - I was asked to call Eva. - Does she have another number? - She'll call when she gets time. - Thank you. This number is in use. Check the number and dial again. This is Bure's boat. I want pictures of all visitors, preferably with him there. - Where is it? - Bjrkudden harbor. I can never return. They hate me. What have you done? Give a fucking answer. Where's Alexander? Someone was in the room when I woke up. - In the morning? - That night. - When David died? - There was a bang. There I was thinking I'd wake up. I didn't know what it was. Perhaps it was a dream. There was a strange smell. Smokey. Someone entered the room. I think I said something. There was a bang. My ears were closed. Alexander wept. I heard the ringing in my ears. He stood in the hallway. With his teddy bear. She stood behind him with a knife. He said Mama. She? Who? She cut his cheek. Oh, god... If you come after me, I'll cut his throat. He cried and said 'mama' and she cut him on his cheek. He was so scared. I helped him. He looked at me. I was so scared she'd murder him. I didn't helped him. She was a terrifying woman. She had an abortion. A late abortion. - How do you know? - She sent me the ultrasound scan. - David said it was true. - Jesus. Why didn't you tell me? Eve, Annika Bengtzon here. I want to ask you about David Lindholm. - What exactly do you want? - His criminal contacts... Forget David Lindholm. This is the last warning. - Good morning. - I've something for you. Yvonne Nordin has a summer cottage. - What happened to your hand? - We'll talk about that later. - Annika, is everything okay? - Yes, nothing's wrong. What happened to your hand? I... - Yesterday I was attacked. - Attacked? - Yes, but I'm fine. - What did the police say? I haven't spoken to them. I haven't had time. - When will you call them? - Soon. Did have to do with work? - What do you mean? - They've threatened me too. - Threatened? - It's not important. Did you inform the police about what happened last night? - What? - I felt I was being followed. - But I thought I imagined it. - I should know that kind of thing. I know. I'm sorry. I thought I imagined it... How can you be so stupid? So smart and stupid at the same time? - You could've called me. - I know. - That's my responsibility. - I thought it wasn't anything. - What are you doing? - I've got pictures. Of course. Come to my office. And you're doing nothing until you get police protection. Come to my office. First we have this man. - This isn't Bure. - Indeed. He was alone, and then... - These don't seem to be officers. - A little later... - That's Bure. - Very interesting. - Police Chief conspires with the mafia. - They seem to me very seriously. - It would be a nice headline. - Then this came. - Find out who they are. - I've a source in the police. Perfect. Immediately call. Okay, a phone call, Immediately after you've called the police. What do you mean? I want you to call right now. - Annika, immediately after that. - What was that? Nothing. I don't know exactly who they are, but... - Can I take them? - Of course. Thank you. I can also use your help. I spoke to Julia yesterday. I think another woman took Alexander. These are the women with whom David has worked. Eva Lagervall, Yvonne Nordin, Johanna Ahlberg... - Can I have these pictures too? - Of course. There are 13 people waiting for you. If you want the police to call you back, please leave your number. - What are you doing here? - Sorry... I told you I don't want to speak? - I want to give you the chance... - I won't comment. Go away. Jingert Karl says you know more about Lindholm and Bure's affairs. - Is it true that they laundered drug money... - Get out of here. - Or should I grab my gun? - Okay, I'm going, I'm going already. You're doing my work. - Did you give Nina Hoffmann the photos? - She asked for them. - Julia reacted hysterically. - Why? She identified Yvonne Nordin as the murderer and the kidnapper. - What do you know about her? - I just met her. Where is she? We sent a car to her summer house in Uppsala. So. Now only a few things to check. Hello, Alexander. Don't be afraid. I'll help you. Please come. My name's Annika. We must hurry. I'm your mother, Alexander. She misses you. Come, we will do this off. Don't move. Let him go. Don't move. Alexander, come over here. - Don't run away. - Please, Yvonne... Police. Drop your gun. Drop the gun. It was the best day of my life. The day I first saw you. I felt so proud as anyone can be. That morning you looked at me and I looked at you. I listened to your breathing, as light as the wings of a butterfly. I'll never forget that day. I'll be there for you always. Everything feels so vulnerable. As the first leaves of a tree... When the spring yet fully arrived. You're still here? Promise me you're part of my future.

I hope not. Good. - Take care of yourself. - You too.
