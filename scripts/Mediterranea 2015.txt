Put the bag here, and now move over. How many did you get? All of them. Three from last time. Plus six more. How much? 600? Hey, stop! Stop! I said only four. You. You. You. And you. The rest of you, over there. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Yeah. Let's go! That is 4,000. I have some... This is better. Okay, I like this. I like this. Okay, that's why, okay, bring 3,500. - Three and a half. 3,000 and a half. - I will give you 2,000. Please, don't talk much, okay? I'll bring change for you. Good luck. Hey! Do you want this? Let me see. - How much are they? - 4,000. 4,000? I have 1,000. Name? Ayiva Seihon. Where to? Burkina Faso. Zabr. 2,000. Take this for now. It should help. Try to spend it slowly. Hopefully things will get better the further along we get. Yes, I know. It's so you can manage, for now. Right now, it's tough, but it'll get better. Do you understand? Yes, everything is fine. Yes. We are here. Abas? He's here. He wants to get with those European girls. You know what I'm saying. Look what Mades put on Facebook. Hold on. He's big now. Look at this. Okay. There he is. As my colleague told you, I can find you work. So you can gather money and pay for your trip. Okay. We will think about it. Ayiva. Come here. Here's your money. Don't count it in front of me. We don't count money here. Hey, man. Can we have a word with you? No, I have things to do. We have contacts in Tripoli. We can't stay here and work. It will take us at least two months to save enough money. Our brothers in Tripoli won't wait for us. We will lose our places on the boat. And we cannot take that risk. Listen. If you can help us get to Libya, I promise to get you a place on the boat. You know very well I can get you there. But if I get you to Tripoli, I want two places. I got this! Starting now, we're out of here! Really? We're out? I got this! Oh, are you not sleeping? Why are you disturbing? Don't you know people are sleeping? Look at the idea of the time. We stop. We stop. We promise. Are you stupid or what? Go to bed before I will sleep, please. Okay, okay. Okay, you want to receive call too. Are you not sleeping? Are you the owner of this place? Huh? Please, leave these premises. Sorry about it. It won't happen again. Move along, quickly. This is Mano. He's your guide. He'll take you to Tinel. It's the last town between Algeria and Libya. Do everything Mano says. Do not ignore his instructions. How does he know if we're going in the right direction? It's easy. You pick a point. Aim for it. And once you get there, you pick another one further away and you head for that one. That's how he does it. Head over that hill. Hello. It's Ayiva. Everything's good. We're in Libya. In Sabha. Yes. We're fine. He's fine. No. Uncle Ousman, I want to talk to you about something. Yes, sir. When we arrived in Sabha, we didn't have anything left. If you could help us, a little more will get us there. I see. So? He'll send it. Listen up! This boat doesn't leave the beach unless one of you drives it. I need a driver, even if you don't like the idea. He's joking, right? Why can't we go? You have to take us, sir. We paid you. You! You have to drive the boat! Hey, motherfucker! I'll do it! Oh, I'll do it. If none of these motherfucker want to do it, I'll do it. I'll drive the boat! If you're driving the boat, I'm not going. What he said? He said you can't drive the boat. Oh, fuck you. If you're a man, stand up and drive the boat. You'll never take that boat anywhere. So sit down. She's not supposed to drive it; You are! We paid you! Calm down. I can do it. I believe I can drive the boat. Where are you from? Burkina. There's no sea there. How are you going to drive us? You don't know how to drive. I'm not going if he drives. Me neither. Hey, you okay? Hey! Do you even know what the fuck you're doing? Oh! Hey! Hey! Where were you? What's wrong? Ah. Welcome. Let's eat. Do you want a beer? No. And you? Do you want a beer? No. Mm. How was the journey? It was okay. Did you find papers? They gave us three months. You'll need to find a job with a contract to get real papers. Three months isn't enough. How are things back home? - Same as before. - Mm. Except they built solar panels for the school in the village. - Mm-hmm. - Boukare did all of it. - Ah, mm-hmm. - He built it all. - He did great work. - Mm. He built the school and sent the solar panels. Mm. It's normal. He has to. He came here a long time ago. And he has the money. It's for our children. By the way, have you heard from your sister? Mm. Not yet. Why not? Because we couldn't call anyone. You had no way of calling her? Call her right now. Take the phone! - I'll do it later. - Call your sister now! She's taking care of your daughter, and you can't even call her? Is this normal? Listen to me. It's more dangerous than you think. I'm telling you, you can't do it. I'm telling you, it's too dangerous. Quiet! People live here, for fuck's sake! Sorry. I'm sorry I yelled, but you don't know what I saw. It's too dangerous for you and Zeina. I just got here. As soon as I make some money, I will send it to you... Oh! Mades! Welcome, my friend! Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. When did you get here? - Who's on the phone? - Aseta. Okay. These are my friends. Yeah, hello. - How's it going? - Good. - What's your name? - Ayiva. Hello, Ayiva. They just got here, and they're already calling you! - Yeah! - No! This is the last time I'm telling you! - Excuse us. - Hey, let's go! Ayiva! Let's go! Mades is here. He's going to take us to our place. - Okay. Say hello for me. - Okay. - Mm. - Uh-huh. What's with all this walking? We need a car! We can't walk like this in this fucking cold. Oh, really? You're cold? Hey! What's this? That's how they drive here? Go get them a heater. Do you have a cigarette? So this is it. I know it's not perfect, but at least it's close to town. To find a house without papers. It's hard. For us. What about work? Right now, there is less. But I'll try to figure something out. For you. And since you just got here... Take this. No, please... I know. Thanks. Take it, for now. Take it. Okay. Okay. I'll catch you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow, man. Abas! Take this. Good morning. Hello. How are you? - Good. - Great.

Okay? - Did you understand? - Yeah. Good. Yes. What's the difference between "we are" and "we is"? "We are" and... Can I ask you a favor? Sure. Do you know someone who can buy this? Yeah, I think so. Let's go. Hey, Abas. I don't want to go. Let's do this, and we'll come back. It's very important. Hmm? I know it's important, but I don't want to go! Hey! How are you?

When my grandfather went to America, he was in New York City. He worked hard, really hard. But he earned almost nothing.

Nothing. Are those yours? They're mine now. Okay. Be careful, man. Ayiva. Give me a cigarette. And a light. You are always breaking my balls. Thank you. Good-bye, Ayiva. Good-bye. Now, Mrs. Fondacaro, your moment has arrived. A special song for little Marta. Give her a round of applause. "Sara Perche Ti Amo. " Ayiva, let's go inside and have a drink. sync, fix: titler
