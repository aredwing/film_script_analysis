Don't be scared. You're a lot shorter than I thought you were gonna be. So? Was your daddy short? He looked tall to me. Hitler was short. Hitler was short? It's a good thing I am not datin' Hitler. That would not work out. Well, you ain't datin' me neither. Anyway, expectations lead to sufferin'. Did Hitler say that? Nope. Buddha. If I'm not mistaken, it is forbidden to quote Buddha. Ignorance is forbidden. Can't be an Aryan by being a fool. Did Buddha say that to you? No, I did. Smarty-pants, huh? That's what you are? You're a smarty-pants? Is that a smile?

I didn't do anything. - Your fucking taillights workin'? - No, everything's fine. - Then that guy... - I didn't do anything. What?

Sonny, wake up. - What? - Wake up. What? - Sounds like someone's in the house. - Okay. Give me a minute. I hear him comin' up the stairs. Wake your ass up... Oh, God, oh. - Oh. - Sonny, who is it? Who's out there? Yo. Hey, who the... Hey, who-who the hell are you? Sonny, who is it? Who the hell are you? - Sonny, what's happening? - Walking into a man's house, - All times of the night, - Sonny, who are you yellin' at? Swingin' a-a-a damn pistol - every which way and everywhere. - What's goin'... I will blow your fuckin' head off, nigger. Sonny! How many are in the house? I said how many in the fuckin' house, nigger. Two. Round 'em up. And you? Old man, get your fuckin' pants on. Let's go! Come on! Jesus Christ, come on! I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'. - Get-Get in there. - Mom! Do what he says, honey. We don't want no trouble. Where's the baby? Where's the fuckin' baby? There's no baby here. Not my babies, no. Mama! Mom. No. Ah, shit. Look-y here. Children in a brother's house. Now there's a surprise. I thought you said two. Adults. Two adults. Yeah, shut up. It's gonna be okay. You think you're smarter than me? Huh? You think you're smarter than me, old man? Shh. Get in there. Stay with me. Anthony. Wake up. Get up. Just open the door. Get your fuckin'... Get in there, boy! Huh? You want some? - No. - Huh? Get back. That's right. Where are the phones? There's one in the bedroom. There's two downstairs. One in the living room, one in the kitchen and that it. Cars, vehicles? - Huh? - Come on, take what you want. We ain't gonna try and stop you. How the fuck do you know what I want? You presumptuous bitch. The Firebird's got a blown gasket. Somehow it runs. Yeah, what else, nigger? Old station wagon's almost out of gas. Firebird got gas? Yeah. Huh? No, no, I said it has a blown gasket but it runs. It's got gas, yeah. Guns, weapon? Huh? No guns... here. You gotta be fucking kidding me. A blue lip out here in the country? Shit. I'm an ex-con. I have no intention of going back. An ex-con? What the fuck do you know about time, man? I know about time. Do you hear that? The neighbors will be sure to hear that, if it goes off. Yeah? Let me tell you somethin', mister. This fires, you won't be worryin' about no fuckin' neighbors. Who's that man? The Boogeyman. You're not the Boogeyman. Hush up! Yeah, that's right, son. I ain't the boogeyman. You are. - Boo! - Come on, leave the baby alone. - He's just a child. - Shut the fuck up. - Yo, stop pointin' that shit at my mom. - No, no, no. - No! - Relax! Fuck you! Listen up. There are more of us. Lots more. I'm just the unlucky fucker that got sent up here to deal with you niggers. But let me tell you, the shit's hittin' the fan tonight. It's a fuckin' race war. Armageddon. Death to Jews and Niggers, you get it? Fuck. What the fuck happened in there? How many people? I don't know, family of five, six. I took care of it. - Six people? - We got keys. - I got eight hours, so let's fucking go. - Whoa, whoa! Wait a second. We can't just take the keys and drive a car out there. What if-What if-What if they call the cops on us? Yank the fucking phones, fuck it. How about they just go right on to the neighbor's house? Fine, we'll take one of them with us. I don't think we got a choice, huh? We'll take a chance. We do not have that kind of chance right now. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Do you hear all these fucking cops everywhere? Yo, I say we jump him. Smash his fucking brains. What? And get us all killed? You heard that man. He's on some white supremacist bullshit. Like, sworn to hate. He's not gonna listen to no shit we say. That's why we let him leave. His business is none of my business. We can't just fuckin' sit here. The word is patience. Sounds like fear. You're gonna take him? You ain't shit. Fuck you! - No. Stop! - You ain't shit. You're not gonna treat my son the way you treat yours. Now, you stop it. Come on. For once, Mr. Walker is right. We just let him leave. And God-willing, then we call the police. No, no, no. No police. No, I have nothing for the police. I can't have no police here. What are you talking about? You can't put your pants on. Let alone pull 'em off. What are you gonna do? Goddamn it. Mama. Handle it. - I said that's enough. - No, it's not enough. I'm just gettin' started. - Mama. - No. We get out of here, God-willing. I'm walkin'. - Then walk. - I had enough of this shit. You walk, you run, do whatever. You ain't no prize. - You ain't no prize, either. - You ain't no prize left. Okay. - Okay. - So, what then? If you're so goddamn smart? - I don't know. I gotta calm down. - Huh? Huh? I gotta think. I gotta think about it. We need to think about it. 'Cause takin' that car is a stupid idea. That is a stupid idea. We can't argue with ourselves, we can't fight him by ourself, we can't beat ourselves up. Yeah, but I'm not trustin' that dude to come back up here and just wait. Patience. Understand that, Anthony? Just a little patience, okay? You saw him when he talked about when I talked about when I did time, that I wasn't gonna do no time, so I had no gun. You saw the way he'd look? He understood that. He thought he could belittle me. He thought he could take me down. Because I had said that. And I looked him right in the eye. He's pointin' a gun at it. I know what time is. I know what this dude is. I've seen these cats before. He knows that us alive, that's what keeps him goin'. He has no place to go. Where does he have to go? He's right here. He's trapped in here. He's even more trapped then we are trapped in. Now you understand that? Okay. Remember. They need us. Would you just fuckin' think? I'm trying to fuckin' think. Not helping. You know what, fuck you. I'm gonna call. I'm callin'. - Who the fuck you're callin'? - I'm callin'-callin' Sobecki's guy. He gave me this number and he said call them if I ever get... Which fucking guy? Sobecki's guy. Do you need any more information? What are you, like, questioning Sobecki all of the sudden? You done lost your fucking mind. My God. How the fuck did I get myself into this mess? Hi! Hey. How are you doin'? Sobecki gave me this number, and... I don't... We don't really know each other, but I thought... He told me, he told me to call this number if I ran into any kind of trouble, and this whole thing, we got this mess, and now we got cops after us. And just, I feel like we need, mmm... maybe we need, maybe we need somebody to come get us or something. License and registration, please. Get on your fucking knees, nigger. Feels good, huh? I need more, 'cause I don't know. You don't know... Okay, no, it's no big deal. I'll just... Okay, thank you so much. Really, it's really good talk... Talk. I told you Sobecki was gonna come through. What did he say? Eddie is gonna call with a plan to rescue us. Doreen, the fucking place is crawling with cops. Eddie also said we gotta... What? We gotta kill them. Kill who? Whoever's in the house. Jesus fucking Christ, Doreen. Those were his exact words? Kill them? Yes, that's what he said. He said... He said you gotta take care of them, but I know what he was talkin' about. For Christ's sake, he was on the phone. What is he supposed to say? Kill everybody while he's on the phone? Maybe fucking take care of them means take care of them. You ever think of that? Discipline and action, that's what Sobecki would say. Discipline? You really know a lot about that. Like, what are you gonna do? You gonna kill a baby? What, are you gonna fight me right now? We are in this together. Are you gonna disobey Sobecki? That wasn't Sobecki. That was Sobecki's man. And for me, that's good enough. What are you gonna do? You're gonna spray the whole goddamn neighborhood - and walk out of here? - Do you think for one second that I want to kill anybody? 'Cause believe me, I do not. I do not, but you know what? I'm not gettin' caught. Why'd you got to go and kill that cop? We were doing so... Jesus Christ, you think I had a choice? Maybe if you brought some fucking money, we wouldn't be in this fucking situation. Goddamn. Anthony. Anthony. Let him come up here. Anthony, you need to calm your little ass down. I'm not gonna wait for him. - Shh. - Come on, boy, these people got guns. Tell him I'll fuck him up. Anthony, shut the fuck up. What the fuck? What do you do to them? Where are they? They're in the fuckin' closet. Get me the fuck out of here. Get... Okay. Hey, hey. What the hell is goin' on here? Shut the fuck up. It's-It's over now. He was just scared, that's all. He's tryin' to make me kill someone? No, no, no. We'll do what you say. There's a baby and a little boy in here. Oh, shit. Out, now. Come on. All on the bed. Sit down. Get your ass in the corner. Nice to meet all y'all. That's-That's a cute baby. How old's that baby? Seven months. Tomorrow. You the father? No. Then how the fuck do you fit into this little menagerie? She's my sister. Where's papa? Oh, fuck. It's not you, old man, is it? No. Oh, shit, I see. Hump and run, black man's dream. White man's burden. Don't get any ideas about suckin' up to these fucking bitches, 'cause they're all the same. - Yeah. - Watch 'em. And you, little Missy. You're gonna come with me. - Where? - None of your goddamn business where. Get your fuckin' ass over here. - I don't want to. - We're just gonna look around, is all. - If any harm comes to her... - You'd do what? Shit your pants, old man? What you gonna do? Let's go, now. Come on, leave the niglet behind. Mommy, no! - Jesus Christ. You either come with me, or I take the baby. Mr. Walker, please do something. - Jesus Christ. Stop it! Hey, hey. You don't have to... Everybody just keep calm. Just keep calm, okay? - Shut up. Anthony. - Just keep calm. - Sit down, Anthony. - Sit down. - Come on. Please. - Come on. All right. We're good, right? We're good. They're just gonna go outside for a minute and we'll hang tight. Okay. You know, if it weren't for me, y'all would be dead right now. Dead. You know that, right? 'Cause I said to him, I said you can't be just killin' people 'cause of their color of their skin. You scared? It's okay. I'm scared. I'm freakin' out right now. I'm freakin' out, look at my hand. Oops. Ah, shit, look at that. - Ah, shit. Ah, shit. - Ah. Quick, quick, quick. You want to hold it? - No. - You don't want to hold it? - No, no. - Come on, hold it. - Make a mess. - I can't. I bet you sucked a few of these, all right. Look at those lips. They're just made for suckin'. I should kill you. I should, but I'm gonna make you a deal instead. You love your kids, right? - Yes. - Yes? Yes. You want to see them again tomorrow, right? Yes. Yes! And the day after? Good. Then you're gonna tell me what he's thinkin' what, plannin' what, sayin' what, comprende? Is that a yes? Yes, yes, yes. Okay. And if I should happen to overhear something that you didn't report to me, that would be a fucking shame, right? - Yes. - Yeah. A downright fucking tragedy. - Um... - Nah, I'm good. I don't want to see it. Tell me about the truck you saw. Blue, green. Maybe brown. No Se. Bullshit, no Se. It's the truth, I swear. What about the woman? White, maybe Black? White or maybe Black. Sarge, I got here as fast as I could. Sarge! I got something. The truck was registered to a Doreen Lesser. Rivers called this in before he went down. Pelican Bay says she's an Aryan Brotherhood groupie. Now, she picked up an inmate this morning. Garrett Tully. Number three in the Aryan Brotherhood. He finished out 15 years today. Of course. We're dealin' with a psychopath. - Luis. - A cop-killin' psychopath. El senor. If you saw anything, okay? We got a cop down over there, I need you to tell me. Sir, I told you everything that I saw. I-I'm sorry. Okay. All right, thank you. Listen, man. We need the make and the model of that car. All right? - Yeah. - We're gonna find this racist bastard. You good? Yeah. They've been comin' back and forth. Shit. Trouble with the law. It's none of your goddamn business. Now, don't... Now, don't tell me. Wasn't a question, just a statement. None of my business what you've done. No lie there. Not interested. Mm. Made my share of troubles. What kind of trouble? Mm. Real trouble. Ah. All I'm saying is... I don't like the law... and you don't like the law. You want out of here, and we want you out of here. Sounds like we have something in common. You got a match? You got a match, light? Come on. Don't tell me there isn't a single fucking match in this entire house. Back here, you got one? Yeah, I got one. Come on, man, let's have it. In my room. Where? I don't know, in the drawer somewhere. I don't smoke. The fuck you don't. Show me. - Yes. - I'm gonna show it to you, anyway. Get... Patience. Patience. Slowly, boy. Go on. Where's that fuckin' lighter? You've ever done time, boy? No. Come on, it's a rite of passage for you brothers, right? No respect without time. Not in my book. Or, your daddy ever done time? I bet you he's done time. My daddy's dead. Your daddy's dead. Whee. How did he die? Fucking gang-banging, holdin' up the liquor store, or what? Desert Storm. He was a soldier. I know what you're thinkin', boy. The old man's weak, the women can't do nothin', so it's up to you, right? It's crossed my mind. Uncross it, motherfucker. Ain't no use dyin' before you see the big house. It just wouldn't seem proper. You know what I mean? Let's go, boy. You look like a farmer. Are you a farmer? No. Scrap metal now. I still fix cars, blinds, you name it. That sounds boring. And what do you do? Home care for the elderly. I could never do it. What about you? I bet you ain't got no job, right? I got one. Deliver pizza on Fridays, sometimes. Sometimes. Shit, it must be nice being black. All that spare time. Where the fuck are we at? Anthony, no. Not necessary, now. He's got a knife. Let me go, my God. Get the fuck off of me. I'm taking her and my family with me. Anthony. I'll slice her neck, I will. Cut away. What the fuck, Tully? Hey! No. Tully, it's me. Yeah, I don't give a shit. Slice, dice, - chop whatever the fuck. - Tully. A-Anthony. Put it down, boy. P-Put it down. You're gonna cut her? - Go on. I got nothin' invested in her. - Tully. Hey, hey. You're gonna... Shut the fuck up, bitch. Get your hand off me. Hey. If he puts it down, you promise not to kill him? If-If he... - gives it up... Stop touching me. You promise not to kill him? Y-Y-Your word? Y-Y-Your word? Your word? - You got my fucking word, nigger. - Your word, okay. No trouble, okay. All right, all right? Tell him that. Tell him! - No trouble. - Okay, yeah. Yeah, your word. Give him your word. My word. All right. That's right. This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. He violated me. Tully, he violated me. He had his hands all over me. He didn't touch her. He didn't touch her. He did! Yes, he did! Anthony! Anthony, baby? Anthony. Anthony, no! Your word. Oh, my God! Anthony. Oh! Your word! He ain't fuckin' dead, is he? Come on. Fuck. Okay. - Okay. - All right. He is not fucking dead. That isn't the fucking problem. You almost got me killed. Nobody fucking talks to me that way, you understand. Least of all you. Shit. Fuck you. Fuck me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Anthony got shot. Is he okay? Is he okay? Just rest, my baby. Tell me. What? What? Is he okay? You gave your brother up, you little bitch. What the hell am I supposed to do? My God, I got two babies. And I told you not to have them. - This is not... - But you had them anyway, didn't you? - You had them, anyway. - my fault! None of it. I'm tired of you blaming me for everything, and this is not my fault. You don't do that. You don't give your brother up, baby. - Mom... - You don't, ever. - Mother. - Give your brother up. - Never! - What was I - supposed to do? - Ever, ever. What you doin'? Unzip your pants. What? I said, unzip your pants. It's okay. I'm just gonna do what I do best. Yeah. You deserve this. You're fine now. You like this? - Doreen? - You like this? What do I got to do to get you hard? I have to talk a little bit? Huh? I can talk. Baby, what's it take to get you hard? You just tell me, I'll do it for you. All right, Doreen-Doreen stop, all right? Okay, look. That's enough. It's like a fucking record. What's wrong with you? White men are the nuts and bolts of society. And their warriors must be as strong and pure as their philosophy. What the fuck does that mean? It means you sacrifice your petty needs and desires for something more important than yourself. Something bigger, you understand? What, did you say that? No, Sobecki did. Sobecki said that. Of course he did. Well, I guess that means prison done turned you gay. Fuck! Don't you ever fucking call me gay, you understand me, you fucking bitch, don't you ever! Get the fuck off of me. Don't you fucking touch... Get off of me. Don't you ever fucking talk to me or grab me like that again. You hear me? Don't fucking touch me again. Fucking touch me. Fucking touch me. Fuck. Fucking touch me. Let's just drive, okay? - Let's just fucking drive. - Don't tell me what to do. Everybody told you not to have them. Tully. Tully. Listen to me. We need to do what Sobecki said. And just slit their throat. - Just slit their throat. - What the fuck are you talking about? - Use your brain. - Listen to me, listen to me. You gotta be a man right now for me. You have got to do something. Be a fucking Aryan. Use your fucking brain. They're more valuable to us alive. To who? Jesus Christ, you don't think we work with their kind on the inside? - This is... - Business is fucking business. We are on the outside right now. We are on the outside. And on the outside, you do them before they do you. That is the fucking business. Fucking... If you're so fucking game, why don't you start with the baby in the crib? You are not getting it. You-You need to do this. You have got to do this. And the baby? Why shoot the baby? - The baby can't fucking even talk. - Fine. Fuck it, the little boy then. - He's seen our faces, start with him. - Shh! What the fuck is wrong with you? Fine. I will. Oh, fu... How he's doin'? He's gonna be okay? I just... I wanna apologize. Um... I'm real sorry. About what I said. Because, um... sometimes you just get into this kind of dilemma, and things come out, you don't really... you don't-don't really know, and I really... I want to apologize for that. We-We all... We all need to stick together. Because he... He's real unpredictable, you know what I mean? I'm scared. I'm freezing, I'm hungry, I just want to go home. I'm hungry too, Mommy. I know, baby. You're hungry? I'm hungry. You want to go get some food with me? No. You just said you were hungry. I'm hungry, too. It's okay. You want to go in the kitchen with me and help me find some food, something to make, like, a peanut butter and jelly with. No. It'll be fun. You and me, we're gonna go make peanut butter... - No. He ain't goin' with you. - He ain't goin'. - The boy stays with his mother. - Go to hell. - The boy stays with his mother. Shut the fu... Hey, shut the fuck up! - I am this close to killin' all of you. - The boy stays with his mother. The boy goes. That's it, it's final. - Go! - stays with... Jesus fucking Christ. You all listen to me, you understand? Let's just... Goddamn, I'd never thought I'd miss solitary. Shut the fuck up. You, go. Now. He's coming. Come on. He's bleeding to death. Shit. - We got to get him to a hospital. - I don't give a shit. Let him bleed. What? We need to get him to a hospital. Bitch, shut the fuck up. You think I don't know that? You think I don't know? Your mama said your name was Jam. Right? What's that short for? Jam? Jamar. Jamar. Jamar. It's, like, peanut butter and jam, right? I have... a little boy. About your age. They-They took him away from me, though. That's the... W-who took him away from you? The-The-The government. The social workers and police. Are you going to kill us? No, baby. No, that's crazy talk. What do you know about death, anyway? I know whoever dies, they go to heaven. I don't know about that. What do you think heaven is like? I don't know. But it is supposed to be cool. Who's that? Shh. Is that the police? Shh. Mama, that's the police! Help. Help. Help. Uh-Uh-Uh. They're just makin' sandwiches, is all. Can't you just go and leave us alone? - Sit down. Mama. Help. Help. Stop. Just... Shut up! I said, calm down, please. It's all right. It'll end soon. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. See? See? Baby. 10-97. Mr. Walker, please do something. My boy. They have my boy. Your... My boy. Your word. They hurt my boy downstairs, Mr. Walker. I hear him cryin'. Mr. Walker, please do something. Please. - Oh, my God, Jamar. - Mommy. Oh, Jamar. Oh, Jamar, are you hurt, baby? Come here, let me look at you. Let me look at you. Oh, God. Do you all believe in God? I know you do. 'Cause you're black. All y'all love yourselves some God. I feel like God is fucking with me. I feel like he has all these favorites. And then there's me. That's crazy, right? What-What if God, when he talks to you, you can't hear because you don't understand what he's saying? What do you do then? 'Cause see, I'm confused. I'm fucking confused. I'm confused as to why your name is Odessa because that... is a white girl's name. That is a fucking white girl's name. 'Cause I went to school with an Odessa and that girl was the whitest girl you ever saw. You should have yourself a pretty black name. Black Moniqua or Shaniqua or somethin'. Those names are so pretty. It's like, it's like name art. Not like some stupid name like... Hey, Doreen. Becky, or take... Doreen. Those fucking names are shit. Doreen. That gives you a pass... - We don't have time for this, all right? - straight into white trash land. Hey! Go get some air. Go get some fucking air. What if he forgets about us? What if he forgets about us? He ain't gonna forget about us. I'm asking you now, go get some fucking air. Shit. Goddamn. Listen. Sir. What? I have to go. Go where? To the bathroom. Fucking hold it. I'm an old man. Yeah, no shit. I don't want to soil on myself in front of... you. Or my family. That's why I'm asking. All right, make it quick. Where's the fucking cash, anyway? What cash? What do you mean, what cash? The cash Sobecki gave to you to get me to Bakersfield. No, no. - Don't try to pull that bullshit. - What do you mean, no, no? Sobecki did not give me any kind of cash. - You have $200 they give you... - Jesus fucking Christ. - When you get out of jail. - How the fuck do you think... - We're gonna get there? - I'm not an idiot. Okay? They give you $200 when you get out. I know that for sure. You think this is my first fucking rodeo? The fuck are you looking at? Give me the fucking money! - Okay, okay, okay. - Give me the fucking money, now. Don't shoot, I'm giving-I'm giving the money. Okay? I'm giving... here. Um... Fucking idiot. Please don't hurt, please don't hurt me, okay. Please. Please, what? Shut the fuck up, brown boy. Speak English, motherfucker. What the fuck are you saying? Shut the fuck up. You want to fucking die? You ever danced with the devil, motherfucker? 'Cause you're dancin' now. I'm gonna make some coffee. It's windy. Always is. You get used to it. I never will. Mm. Prison does something to a man. Makes him bitter and... flexible. When I was younger... I had the courage and the will. I mean, that was never the problem. But prison... prison gave loyalty to an idea. You know, something that was bigger than me, stronger than me, more important. And I-I felt blessed. You know? For the first time in my life, I was more than a piece of shit. I ain't gonna lose that. Mm. What time is it? Quarter to 7:00, there abouts. Yep. I was supposed to have a meeting with my parole officer this morning. I guess I'm missing that one. Yeah, been there. That's... Uh... strong? Black? Next thing we need to do is go from house-to-house. Yeah. Yeah, they're close. All right, keep me posted. What happened? They catch him? No. No. They're hidin' in one of those houses. That's where I grew up. Ray, you have to call your father. This is no longer about the stuff that's between the two of you. You need to make sure he's okay. All right. That's it. That's him. Walker here. Hey, Pop, it's Raymond. Uh. The reason why I'm calling... What is it, son? There's a deputy that was killed last night. Not too far from where you live. We heard the commotion. What do you mean, you heard the commotion? Um... The whirring, helicopters and... and all that. Oh. Okay. Is everybody-everybody okay in the house? Yeah, Ray. You know, Dad, I'd be more comfortable if you, uh... you know, if I stop by, just check on you. Ask him to coffee. I was wonderin' if, uh... me and you can get a cup of coffee. You almost blew it. I did that a long time ago. You wanted me to call him. What'd he say? Baby, I can't be going through this all the time. Okay? You know? Every time I get on the phone with him, it's like... I feel like a boy. I'm nobody's boy. I'm my own man. - Ray. - Honey. Know what I'm saying. Please do not ask me to call this man again. That's all I'm saying. What the fuck is taking them so long? Huh. Friends not showing? They will. Believe me, they will. Aryan Brotherhood, that's right. Never sacrifice one of their own. You watch your fuckin' mouth. Sit your ass down. Hey, hey, hey. What are you doin'? I'm just gonna call this number right now. Who the fuck you callin'? Do you really want to wait any longer? Worth the stomach... Stop it. Shut the fuck... Do not fucking touch me. Just let me do this. I think we've been here long enough, and it's fucking killing me. I can't do this anymore. Hello? Hi, hey. Hey. Oh, my God, thank God you answered. - This is Doreen, Sobecki's girl. - Doreen? Yeah. Are you guys gonna come 'cause we're... What? - Who is this? - It's Doreen, Sobecki's girl. Called you last night, we talked and you told him... Who? - You got the wrong number. - What do you mean, wrong number? This is, this is Doreen. I talked to you. You told me last night you all were comin' here and you were gonna... You got the wrong number. - Doreen. This is Doreen. - I'm hanging up now. And you... Hel-Hello? Hello? Fuck. Oh my God. Fuck me. Well? Well? What do you fucking think, well? He acted like he didn't even fucking know me. What do you think he's gonna do? Jeopardize the whole goddamn word for a two-bit fucking skank like you? That's really fucking nice to say to me right now. What does that make you, huh? - What did I ever... - You're still free to take a car. Thank you so much. Considering there's cops everywhere. That's a great idea. There's still another way. Go on. They got roads around here. Dozens of roads. Dirt roads connected to private roads. I know every last one of them. Better than them. I don't think that that's gonna work for us, Tully. I'm not talking about you. That'd be foolish. I'm talking about me. What, you're gonna drive us out of here? Give me a break. No, sir. I go alone. You're crazy. I take you, and we hit one roadblock, and they see us turn around, it's all over. But an old black man... drivin' a rusty automobile, they don't pay it much mind. Tell me you're not really believing this bullshit. And if you don't return? Or you bring back the law? Yeah? You need more collateral? I ain't got it. Tully. Tully, please tell me you are not buyin' into this. Fuck it, you got a better plan? Not yet. Here's what I'll do. I'll get gas. I'll get groceries. I'll empty out my bank account. Not bad. $6,000 and some change. And a map out of here. Listen to me. Do not let this nigger hustle us right now. Baby, we got to think. We just lost our only shot. We gotta come up with a better plan. Do you understand me? This is not it. Him sittin' there talkin' is not it. Come on. No, not this old man. Because if he does... I will fuck everyone in this house and he knows it. He ain't dumb. Something goes wrong, and you come back to a heap of bodies, you understand? Understood. I'm not leaving, unless... Unless what? Anthony comes with me. I don't fucking think so. Fuck you. This is a stupid fucking plan. Tully, look at me right now. He is fucking niggering you. You are getting hustled by a fucking nigger. He comes, or I don't go. No, no, no. There is no struggle here. Look at this fucking black man telling you what to do. Shut up. Fuck, Tully! All right. You're on. Y-You hang in there, son. Hey. Anthony. Hey, you gotta learn. You fight with your mind. Yes, sir. Okay? Okay, son, you did good. All right. I'm proud of you. I am. Okay. We got roadblocks on every major road out of here. Perimeter has been set for 20 miles in every direction. There's been no reports on any stolen cars. These guys are still here. We need to go house-to-house, door-to-door and smoke these jokers out. I want these fuckers found. Sanchez, with me. After I read the report, we'll be good. We should get on to my house. They gotta be in one of these houses. I'm fine checking it out. Hmm. Why don't I look around the side? - Okay. - You're okay? Yep. Cop. - Send them away. Raymond. It's funny, I just saw my dad driving down the road. Did he tell you I called? No, he-he doesn't tell me much. Huh. The reason why I'm here is that there's been a murder. And, um... What happened? A fellow officer has been killed. Well, um... It would make me feel really comfortable, if you just allow me to come and just take a little browse. Okay, look, I'm not gonna get in the middle of what's going on between you and your dad. You're not gonna get in the middle of it. Raymond. No. This is not your house anymore. It's not about it being my house. It is not a good time. And you know your dad will not like like you in here. Listen, I don't want to get into any... family feuds. You and your dad, what's going on between the two of you has nothin' to do with me. - Hey. - Hey. Everything all right? Heard that. Just family stuff. Not a fucking word. Cassie, I don't hate you. You know I didn't mean them things that I said upstairs. Get on your fucking knees. Sir, we can work this out. Shut the fuck up. Tully! Shit. Tully. Tully. Tully. Tully. Tully. We got a cop behind us. - Fucking... No worries. - It's a fucking nigger cop. I hate fucking cops. I didn't do anything. - Your fucking tail lights workin'? - No, everything's fine. - They're good? - I didn't do anything. What? Jesus fucking Christ. - Goddamn. - You just let me do all the talking. Do not fucking take that gun out. My God. Fuck. - Fuck. - Fucking niggers. Do you think he knows about the gas station? He's gonna fuck with us. No, he's not. No, he's not. I'm just gonna do all the talking, all right? I got this. Do not fucking say a word. - I ain't fucking going back, all right? - Don't do anything crazy. I'm pullin' over. Just play it cool. Let me do the talkin'. Don't you fucking stutter. Correction, this is 234. Good evening, officer. License and registration, please. Absolutely. Absolutely. Was I drivin' a little bit too slow? I was, wasn't I? Yeah, I figured. It's, um... My-My doctor h-has prescribed these, um... these special glasses for me. Yeah, I have a, um... License and registration will work, thank you. Mm-hmm. Okay, this is, um... Besides drivin' too slow, was I doin' anything else wrong? I got these. We're in a little bit of a rush. I'm tryin' to get him to his mom. She's not feelin' so good. Drivin' slow for being in a rush. I know, it's the glasses thing. They... I, it's real hard for me to see. It's for safety purposes, you know. - Can I see your license, please? - Oh, right. This is, this is my license. Terrible picture. What is it with that, right? Licenses, you get the worst photos. - Thank you. - Yup. - Wait here, please. - Sure. Absolutely. Thank you. That was real fucking smart. The fuck were you doin', anyway? I was manipulating him. Trying to get him to like, you know. You must have been doin' somethin' for him to turn - the fucking lights on. - Did you hear what you're sayin'? I'm fucking slow. Fucking clack cops, thinkin' they got somethin' to prove. Okay, just chill. We're all good? Your name, sir? Tully. Full name? Man, I didn't do nothin' wrong. Nobody said you did. Then you don't need my name. May I see your identification, please? I know my rights. Tully, he's just, he's just askin' for your... What? He's just pullin' rank for no reason. No, he's not. He's just... I need to see your driver's license or form of identification. She gave you her license, all right? Everything's in order. We weren't speedin' or nothin'. - Just back off... - I'm going to ask you one more time. I need to see your I.D. Please. I told you. I didn't do nothin' wrong. He's just in a mood. Excuse me. You need to step out of the vehicle. No, you stay put. Step out of the vehicle, now. You hear me talking to you. - Please. - That's how you want to play it? Sir, he's... This is Deputy Rivers. I'm on... Get on your fucking knees, nigger. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Get down. Back up. - Hey, hey, hey! - Get down! - Hey. - Get down. Get down. - Put the gun... - Get on your fucking knees, now. - Put the gun down. - Fuck you. Get on your knees. On your fucking knees. - Okay, wait, we can work this out. - Get down! We can work this... Shut the fuck up. - Fucking cops, you're all the same. - Hey, you don't need to do this. You say you want to help us, and then you stab us in the fucking back. I seen it every day. It makes me fucking sick. Put the gun down. - We can work this out. - Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Tully, look at me. Tully! What? Shit! Tully. Fuck! Stupid motherfucker! Look what you made me do. Look at what you fucking made me do. You dumb fucking nigger. What? Huh? What? Do something. Tully! What the fuck are we gonna do for now? Shit. Huh, what? Do somethin'. This is real? Fucking go. Fuck, Tully. Tully, what the fuck did you do? Let's go. - What the fuck did you just do? - Just fucking go. - What did you do? - Just fucking drive. What did you do? What did you do? What the fuck? Did you fucking kill him? Let's just go. - Let's go. Just fucking drive. - Did you fucking kill him? A fucking cop? Shit. Shit. Oh my God. Don't say a fucking word. Did you kill a fucking cop? Did you just kill a fucking cop?

I don't know who you are, and I don't know why you came here. And I don't give a shit whether anybody ever cared for you or whether if you cared for anybody. You ever loved somebody, Mr. Tully? I love my daughter. And I love my son. But you shot him. And as long as I'm breathing, my boy, he's not gonna die alone. Ain't gonna call no police. That's not gonna happen. If you're gonna kill me... you could shoot me now. 'Cause I'm leavin'. Stop the car, sir. Got a lockdown on the area. No one can go in. Hey, you must know my boy. Raymond Walker. Deputy Raymond Walker. The officer, when I left, said I could return. M-My wife's alone. Being as you're a father of an officer, and live down the road, go in but you stay in the house once you get there. Right, m-much obliged. - Yes. - Much obliged. Okay, let's move that out. Odessa. - Raymond. - Odessa, come... - Raymond. - Odessa, you're okay? - Raymond, Anthony. - What? Anthony's bleedin', he's been shot. - What do you mean? - He's been shot.

Okay, what do you want me to do? I don't know, I don't know, just... Tell the screws to let you go. Fuck, man. Just give me the word and I will kill every fucker in this house. That's all I ask, just give me the word. My word, with half the FBI listening? I got fucking hostages here, Paul. I've been out of jail for 24 fucking hours, I am not going back. You ain't got dick! You ain't got dick. You got a house full of porch monkeys, I got hemorrhoids, and neither is doing us any good. You listen. Last time I talked, you were supposed to take care of Bakersfield.

You gotta go south on this. I ain't surrenderin', Paul. I ain't fuckin' goin' back to jail. You are going to do as they say. I ain't fuckin' surrenderin'. - I ain't surrenderin'. - Don't. Shh, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I ain't surrenderin'. Hey. What's the white man do, Tully? What's a white man do, Tully? He brings the bolts down. Now, right now the bolts for you are walking out of that house with both hands over your head. If I come back to jail, Paul, what's gonna happen to me? Am I gonna be safe? Let me hear you guarantee it. - I did 15 fucking years for you, Paul. - Tully. Listen to me. Fifteen fucking years. Tell me I'll be safe. Do you hear what I'm sayin' to you, Paul? This ain't no fuckin' Armageddon. It's a business. And you're out of it. I need your fucking help right now. Don't leave me here, Paul. All right, they're-they're callin' me. Tully, I gotta go. Wait, Paul. Paul, don't. - See you soon. - Paul. Fuck. Paul. Paul, I did 15 fucking years for you! It's done, hang the fuck up. To dawn, motherfucker. Fuck you. Don't you fucking leave me, motherfucker. Fuck! You're a fucking dead man! You're fucking dead. I'm not gonna beg for my life. I'm not gonna beg for my life. What is it, Tully? Huh? My skin? If it's my skin... killin' us won't save you. Hmm? But what if it is... something inside of you? Something pained deep inside of you that you're fighting. Well, if it is, maybe we're fighting the same fight. We're in the same boat. I lost everything and I ain't goin' back. You haven't lost everything. How? You haven't lost everything. You feel afraid? Yeah. You're afraid. You're afraid of the choice that you have. And right now, the choice you have is to put that gun down. Right now. And we walk out of here. That's the choice you have. This is my fucking choice. And this is my choice. And at the end of the day, you'll always be a fucking nigger. Yes. Nigger. Nigger. It always comes down to that. Lazy, ignorant. Takes what isn't his. Lazy. That nigger. No. Always are. Always blaming his circumstances as an excuse to get what he thinks he deserves, that nigger. Hell, that nigger doesn't think about the future, tomorrow. Today, he thinks about getting his sneaky, grubby, running, grabby... that nigger. Yeah, that nigger. Huh? There's only one nigger in this room, in this house. And that nigger is you. That nigger's you. That nigger's you, Tully. That nigger is you. The fuck. Feels good, huh? It's a wonderful world. - Come on. - Don't. Come on, man. It's okay. We're goin' in. We gotta move now. There's no choice. SWAT, let's go. We're coming out. Stand down. Here we are. We're comin' out. Raymond, you're here? Stand down, my pop's comin' out. Ray? You there? Yeah, Pop, I'm right here. Tell them to back down. We're coming out. Okay? We... are coming out. Keep movin' forward. Don't shoot. Tully, turn to your right. Get down on your knees. Clasp your hands behind your head. Hands clasped. Stay right there. Hey. Much obliged. It's all good, Dad. It's all good. Mm. Love you. Love you. Got a lot of work to do around here. Yeah, son?
