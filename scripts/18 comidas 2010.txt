Are you going to stop loving me? -How will you tell mom and dad? -l don't have to tell them. How can you think you don't have to tell them? lt's not that important, why does it matter? -l feel ashamed. -Juan, don't. And you should have told me. -How have things changed? -What's changed? You're fooling me. l'm not fooling you. You don't fool your brother or your parents. This is how things are. Are you going to stop loving me? l'm telling this so you listen. l feel lonely. lt seems quite normal to me. Maybe it seems strange to you, or l seem strange, but... if l'm alone all day, then it's quite normal for me to behave like this. Because l'm bored. That's it. Sorry, Sol. l didn't want you to feel bad. l'm really sorry. l thought you were making fun of me. And we haven't seen each other for so long. Here, a present, it's the latest in brooches. ls it the crab of peace? Poor things, they were alive only a moment ago.

Juan, l swear l'd kill you right now. -l'd kill you right now, l swear it. -You'd kill me? l feel like kicking the shit out of you. Why? Because l tell the truth? That's what bothers you, l tell the truth, while you live in your world of lies. Someone tells you the truth -and you kick the shit out of him. -What truth? -That's your problem. -What truth? What l'm telling you, that's the truth. What's the truth? What are you talking about? What's the truth and what's not? -What truth? -That's what l'm telling you... ...you like living a lie, so live a lie. What lie? It's myfucking life, asshole!

One moment, damn it. Look, Ana, sorry... Since you've got me involved in this, l'm going to say what l think. You seem a bit rude. l like your brother and his bomriend... his husband. l don't dislike him either. You don't like him because you haven't bothered getting to know him l'm just saying l don't like this. Well if you don't like it, get the fuck out of here. Fine, l'll fuck o and you stay here in your fucking house. But he's your brother, damn it. Are my hands cold? Sol, please. You're so sad. Oh, God. You know what l'd have given for this 10 years ago? You'd have had more energy in you. l'm sorry if you don't like the way l see things, but it's too late to change now. l'm not asking you to change, it's not for me to do so, or disagree with what you think or how you feel. l'm just saying today is an important dayfor him and even though he's a man l love him and l'll look after him as if l were his brother. Did you know my son had a nightmare last night? He dreamt that a dinosaur ate him. -l should go now, shouldn't l? -Yes. Ok, bye. Good luck.
