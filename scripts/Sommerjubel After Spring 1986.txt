We can swim without. But towels? We'll dry in the sun, won't we? what if someone sees us? Okay then... - Where's the ox? - He's far away! Jump in! You can't, what if... what if... What if the big eel grabs you! The biggest one can eat a whole pony. Does yours get small in water, too? No. It's probably the big eel that took yours. It's actually good that it's small. Huh? Well, 'cause... What happens when you kiss? I already know. Do you know how to kiss? Mmmm... You've probably tried it out on your mother. No, I haven't! - Tell me...? - What? How do you actually kiss? Like this! There's no taste. No taste? You have to close your eyes, and think of someone. - Who do you think about? - Kari. Then I'll think of Aase. My dear, old, trusty Volkswagen... Now you have to start! My dear, trusty Volkswagen... Drive safely, dad! I have to piss. Let's have a pissing competition! Me first! Okay... Ready... Steady... Go! Now I'll show you. One... Two... Two-and-a-half... Go! What was it you should show me? But I didn't really have to go. Okay, we can have a rematch, now! Aase and Kari! Oystein and Trond with pants off... How naughty! We can see that you're alone. They probably won't tell. But they've seen us. We were skinny dipping together last year. But that was last year. Is it too hot for a bathing suit? - What do we do now? - walk backwards. That's no better, you moron. - Should we? - Yeah! Come and get them! No, I wanna se what happens. What's for dinner? Fish...! - Have you been swimming? - Me? No! - But you have wet hair. - Wet hair? Well, before, Trond and I were out and... Like... Well, you should have seen that large eel, it could have eaten a pony! Yes, and then what? Then... it got so hot that... I dipped my hair in the creek. You know you mustn't swim in the lake. Of course I know that. It's probably very cold, too. But... are you Oystein's father? Oystein? Yes, I am. I see, I'm Ida Lo... Oystein's teacher. I'm...Pe...lle... I need a bookshelf. I have some measurements here. Can't anyone help you? Well, maybe I can... ...make it, I mean... Come back if there's anything more you need. Thank you very much! can I... call you some day. A phone number? I'm sure we'll meet in town some day. Bye... Hi, boys! I'm home! No! What in the...? drink spilt all over the floor. - Puddles! - Spill puddle! Summer holidays start soon, and then... - What will we have for dinner? - Beefsteak and fried onions. Every day? Maybe... Dad? Let's get them! Should we? Will you get us? Yes. - Just try! - You don't dare! - We can get them some other time. - Don't get yellow now. - Aase is strong... - Don't you remember what they did? Should we have a peeing competition, or what? But you're handicapped. Not when it comes to distance, so there. - Have you tried it? - Yep, at the beach in Ase. I won. - Should we? - "No!" Not me! Truce, or...? - Truce. - Truce. Help! Did you hurt yourself? Let's swim naked! No! Yes! Everybody. - No, Jesus would mind. - Huh, that's just your father talking. Apples and pears, hanging from trees, when they are ripe, they fall to the ground. We stand below, we stand below, We all stand there, and pick them all up. You won't tell anyone? ...that we swam without clothes. No... We've been naked before. Yes, before! When we were little. But nothing's different now? Yes! It's bad to be naked when we are as big as we are now. Pah! It's true, and you're always bad. - Pimples everywhere. - And lots of hair on the butt. But soon, we'll become very different. Ah! I don't want to be that big. Me niether! Let's race back! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! bedtime, boys. Go brush your teeth. Go brush your teeth, now! - Just one more? - But only one. Oystein? Your teacher... Is she any good? Yes, she's okay. And, her husband... What does he do? Her husband? No idea. Maybe he's... A pilot...? A pilot? What makes you think that? Pilots always have such beautiful women. Two even, two even! Good night, Oystein. ...tell you the ship goes, in this year, Backs against, two embrace... - Hi! - Hi, where's Kari? - She's inside, repenting her sins. - Huh? Her sins? Has she done something wrong? Maybe she didn't eat her dinner... Her mother and father are quite strict. Should we begin, or...? Elle, delle, I will tell you, the ship goes, in this year. Backs against, two embrace, snip, snap, snout, You are out! I'm coming now! I'm coming now! - Let's hide properly. - How? In the woods. - I'm not allowed. - Yes, come on. Come and set me free! - Should we? - Come on. Where are you? Come out! What now? Er... We could undress again... If I can see yours, you can see mine. But, I've seen it before...? It's more exciting than before, because... now can we kiss without clothes on. If it's a secret between us... Yes. But... I don't have to take it all off, because it's so wet around here? No. And you...? Won't you...? - Do you know how to kiss? - Mmmm... Do it then, before Jorgen shows up. Ouch! What if we get a baby? - It's Kari's father. - Quiet! He's very angry. Maybe he'll hit dad? - But I've said... - They were naked! Yes, yes, I've heard, so go and shut the door behind you. And the girl had a nose bleed, too. Not our Kari, and the kids are so big now that... They're probably sexually mature by now... What does sexually mature mean? Maybe it's like apples and pears? When they're ripe, they fall. I didn't hit Kari. She fell over and hit herself. And the other stuff, Aase suggested that... - Have you been listening? - No, but we heard everything. Dad, what does sexually mature mean? Later, Arne. So, that's why your swimsuit was dry? It was Aase. You shouldn't tell on others, I assume you took them off yourself. - But, was it fun...? - Sure! E... er... no... A little? Maybe... Is this sexually mature? No... But the next time, you keep your swimsuit on, Oystein... so there won't be any trouble. Right? And now we're done discussing this. Let's eat! I think I'll go out. Are you asleep, Oystein? Almost... Sleep tight. Dad? What exactly is sexually mature? Sexually mature? It means you can have babies. Oh, so that's why we need swimsuits? Swimsuits? Aha, like that... Yes, in a way it's true. It's okay. You don't get a baby just because you took your swimsuit off. Unless you do something else. And if you do something else? So, Aase, could... So, Aase, could... Aase? No, she's too little. Tomorrow, the bookshelf is finished. You should come over and tell me what you think, if you have some time to spare some day. Love, to you, and Oystein, Miss Ida. Hey! Wait for me! Stop! Er, I'm looking for Ida. Miss Lo. Own entrance. Watch yourself. I saw Petter. Petter? I'll get ya for that! How childish you are. I don't have permisson to play with you, but there isn't anybody around, so... Why did you tell your father? - Mum told him. - Why? - For everything you do. - What? Because you pushed me so I bled. Like this? You are so stupid! Stupid girl! Should we go steady? Go steady! Go steady! Oystein and Kari, Oystein and Kari, every day, Oystein and Kari. Well, what do you think? Be honest. Well, it's kind of special. Well, don't you like the other side? Yes, it is very nice. Thanks, master. Have you got a dog? Yes, I have. It's such nice company, when you're alone. He's probably a pilot. Pilots always have such nice women. What dreadful weather we've had this summer. We'll soon be able to go fishing in the garden. It was a long time since I went fishing. If you want, we can go fishing together. Do you mean that, Per? I think I can hear Petter. - Been a long time? - Not very. Hey! Hi, dad! But...? Aren't you done yet? No, not yet. - Potatoes. - We cooked them, too! And spin-dried them? Yes! - Mashed potatoes! - No! Well, it was effective... It's good that it wasn't today she's coming for dinner. Who? Ida. We don't know anyone called Ida. But you know someone, Oystein. Miss Ida. But, you're wrong, dad. I haven't done anything. What are you doing? Don't eat that! But I've put salt on it. What would she be doing here? Just visiting... Maybe we go on a fishing trip. All of us. You're lying! How stupid you are, dad. Fishing trip!? You don't know what teachers are like. You have to help them every time they get anything. There was this... great, big eel. Mmmm, smoked eel is so tasty. It was long ago since I've been out fishing, Per. Look! I've got one. May I see? But, Oystein, you've got one too. Should I put my hand in the air, maybe? Could you go and get Arne, Oystein, so can Ida and I fry the fish. Can I have some? Looks tasty. Do that again. Pah! We've got company, you can never guess who. Yes... Just a lady with red hair. Lady with red hair? It was Miss Ida. Pah! You'll never fool me. Wanna bet? Sure, on what? On the sizzle-powder. I'll win anyway, and what do I get? An ice-cream. Let's see then. Okay. - Oystein. - We have to be sneaky. Why? Because... Maybe... - Well, I think it'll pay off. - You're full of tricks. They're moaning or something. Can I have another look? Yes, but only once. Bed-playing! And your father kissed her. He's just crazy! - No. - Yes. Don't get mad, but are they... Are they... Lovers, or something? They've been together all day. Do you want some? Shall we go steady? Mmmm... - Then we have to kiss. - Do we have to? Mmmm... They have to get some air soon.
