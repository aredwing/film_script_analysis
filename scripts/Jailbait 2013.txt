Gotta be tough. What do you want me to say? You're the nicest person in here. If I was nice. I wouldn't be in here. Why are you in here? I don't talk about it. Look at that skinny bitch.

She's a troubled little girl and we're working our butts off to get her life all cleaned up. You know that? Right? She told me some things about you. Yeah. Yeah. Oh Jane I'm so sorry about your eye. I really am. Hope it gets better. And probably take some Advil. I will really help. Ok? Thank you. Thanks for telling me everything. Yeah. Yeah Jane? Uh huh. Yeah. Let's go ahead and finish her off. Security! Oh my god. Come on. Come on. Anna, do you know why I called you in here? No. Because I think you know who killed Jane. I don't. My gut feeling... It's the same person who did that to your face. Why would she do that? Cut the crap. If you haven't noticed she's crazy. Rumor has it that you're next. Anna, good luck at the talent show. I'm really looking forward to watching you play. Rapping Give it up to killa Kal and the K block crew. Ya ya that was ill. Up next I got some classy shit for your ass. Anna Nix on the cello. Yeah you heard me right. The mother fucking cello. So put your hands together and make some NOISE! Anna Nix. Is that good princess? That was amazing. My who twelve years of doing this, I've never heard or seen anything quite like that. No no no no no no. I want you to keep that. Keep it. It's yours. You've done me right. You've done me right. You know... When I heard you playing tonight, When I looked up there and I saw you, So you deserve a chance. You deserve a REAL chance. So what I've done, I've schedules a parole hearing for you. Really? Mmhmm. Next month. Now take it off. That's good. Mmhmm. Oh. All of it. Yeah. Oooh yeah. Lay down. There we go. You know you could look like you're enjoying it a little bit. There we go. I got a parole hearing. Next week. I wouldn't be so quick to trust Frank. He likes to pump people up then crash them. I got a deal with him. Well what does he have to gain if you're gone? What's up? Hey! Keep moving. Keep moving. Have fun Cinderella. Keep mopping. Talking shit bitch! Talking shit! Huh? Letter up. Parole hearing. September 13th. What up bitch? Huh what! What up bitch! Hey!

We had a deal. You're right. I'm totally fucking with you. So this is our last one, so I really want to enjoy this. So let's make it... slow. Come here. You're next. Come on. 0822? Anna Nix? Sentenced for 4 years for involuntary manslaughter. Served 1 year 3 months. How are you today Ms. Nix? I'm just really grateful for the opportunity to be here. Tell us why you feel like you should be released? I feel like I am 100% rehabilitated. Do you feel remorse for your actions? Yes. I feel terrible that it happened. I'm really sorry. I was young and stupid. From the review of your file it looks like you have had numerous infractions in your intake here. Care to explain? Those infractions were mainly due to trying to adjust to life in here. I'm truly sorry for everything that happened and I have since matured. Warden. Anna Nix is a special girl with a wonderful talent. She's an amazing Cello player. She was gracious enough to perform for us. It was one of the most amazing displays of talent... I've ever seen and I really really mean that. And as much as I would like to say that Anna Nix is a model inmate, Unfortunately she has a real problem with authority. I don't think it's just her necessary acting out. I just think it's a matter of circumstance. Perhaps it would be better if she remain in here for a while longer before she goes to the outside. Wow. In light of the warden's recommendations, and your numerous infractions here, I have no choice but deny you parole at this moment. Wait! What? Before you lock me away again. I would like you to see what your trusted does behind closed doors. What is this? Let me take a look at this. What the hell is that? Let me see that. I can take a look at this- - Don't move! Don't move. - Let me see it, Let me see. What the hell is this? Officer get her out of here. You have a lot of explaining to do. That is obviously a staged performance. Can you not see that? It is not a staged performance. Officer, please detain this man! Knock it off ladies! Knock it off! If I was you I would get too happy. You still go me. Uh huh. Yeah. Well this whole place is messed up. Did you see that video? That was some messed up stuff. Well we need to get internal affairs involved on this. Ms. Nix. What you did today was very very brave. And on behalf of the state of California, We apologize. We promise you a full on investigation will take place, and justice will be served. In light of today's events, We grant you parole today. You're free. Come on. Let's go. Thank you. Good luck. I'm sorry about the ways things turned out. I'm sorry too. See you in the outside? Don't come back.
