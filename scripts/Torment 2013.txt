I'm in here with you. Well, go check. Duke! You forget how to eat? Lost my appetite. Well, go find it somewhere else. Table's meant for eating. What the hell? Maggie? Shit. What the... I won! The screaming contest champion. Once again is dear old d-A-D. I'm bad at that. I've traveled for millions. And millions of miles, And I'm very, very hungry. do you have any carrots? No. You don't? How do you know that carrots are good for your eyes? Because you never see a rabbit wearing glasses. Bonk! All right. Your turn. Are you done with this? Yes. Are you sure? Going, going, gone. Do you know what a rabbit's. Favorite tent style is? You call this a cabin? Yeah, what would you call it? Hmm, I don't know. A second home? Okay, it's our second home. Wakey, wakey, boss. We're here. Don't go too far, Liam. Oh, he'll be fine. Aw, crap. Oh! Hey. It's gonna be great. I really hope so. Okay. You like? Just relax, and I'll get some dinner ready. Why is it so hot in here? The thermostat is cranked. Don't sit there. Liam? She can't sit there. Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. Yes, you can. Hey, we talked about this. That isn't her chair! Hey, boss... I'm sorry. Are you all right? You can sit there. Hey, Liam... shit! Liam, I want you to come back inside. And apologize to Sarah. Did you hear me? That isn't her chair. It's everybody's chair. It's mommy's chair. I know things haven't felt good lately. And I'm not asking you to forget about mommy. I'm never gonna forget her. But we can't change what happened. All we can do. Is choose what's going to happen. Will you come back inside, please, And apologize to Sarah? She cares about you. She deserves to be given a chance. No. Okay, fine. Then you can have your phone back. When you apologize to Sarah. Cory? What the hell? Cory? Sarah? Jesus. What is it? What... what happened in here? Nothing. Listen, stay with Sarah. Don't let him out of your sight. I gotta find how they got in. Yeah. Why don't you show me your room? Happens more often than people would like to admit. Kids see a house boarded up for the winter, And they spend a week partying, drinking, you name it. Then they move on. And there's no way of catching them? Nah, it's pretty rare, unless the neighbors saw, And they get a license plate, But that's even rarer still. But don't you dust for fingerprints. Or clothing fibers or something? Not a "b and e," no. You watch too much TV. What about the blood? Yeah, well, We know at least one of those drunken teenagers. Was a female. Anything missing? I can't find my mouse. What's that about mouse, there, young fella? Oh, that's, um, that's his stuffed mouse. Don't worry, boss. I'm sure it's under the bed or something. I looked under the bed. He isn't there. Well, I'm sorry, but, uh, I can't file a report for anything under $100. You know what, buddy? You should come up here more often. Either that or hire somebody. Get 'em to stop in every once in awhile. Mow the lawn. This really didn't have to happen. Yes, well, it's been a busy year. Listen, uh, This is gonna sound odd. Um, My wife... it's her first time up here. It's our first time anywhere as a family. Newlyweds, huh? Yes. Just a few months ago, And I really need them to feel safe. This is my card. That's my personal number. You give her that, she'll feel safe. Thank you very much. Good. Board up that door. Turn on some lights. Your family's gonna sleep fine. All right. Thank you. Why did you marry my dad? Well... remember we talked about this? You and your daddy and I? Because your daddy loves me, And I love him, And we both love you, Very, very, very much. Don't say that. Why not? I don't love you. Hickory dickory dock, The mouse went for a walk. Mr. Mouse! Little rabbit, this is little monkey, Mr. Mouse and piggly. It's not safe to stay here. Where are we going to go? Home. We just drove six hours. We're not gonna let some dumb teenagers ruin this for us. Huh? What do you think? It's just creepy. People were in here. I know, I know, I know. Listen, I'll go to the Bronson's, And I'll see if they saw anything, And then we'll start over. I'm trying. I am. I'm afraid nothing's ever going to change, And, I just... I don't know. Okay. Listen to me. Listen to me. We're family, And one day soon, We're gonna make this family bigger. We're gonna make anew family, And Liam is just gonna have to deal with it. Okay. Are you sulking? No. I'm not sulking. I'm not sulking. Which reminds me: Officer Hawkins. Gave me his card to give to you. Wow. Yeah, so... if you get lonely while I'm out. Useful. Be right back. Hurry up! I will. The enemy is in my sights. Kill confirmed. The enemy is in my sights. Kill confirmed. Hello? Jim? Maggie? Anybody home? Liam? Liam? Are you done in the bathroom? Do you love Sarah more than you loved mommy? No. Not more, Just different. Different how? Well, When two people really love each other, They want to become part of the same family. But sometimes the universe has plans for us, Plans that we can't even understand. And sometimes, if you're really lucky. You get to meet somebody new, And they want to become part of your family too. And it's not wrong. To want to let them in. And I'll tell you something: We're those lucky guys, boss. I feel like this isn't our family anymore, And it never will be? Well, Just promise me you'll give it a shot. 'Cause I think... think your mind's gonna change. Okay? Promise? Yeah. Yeah? All right, let's go to bed. Come on. Under the covers. One, two, three! All right, boss, Sleep well. What did they say? They said it's nothing to worry about. The same thing happened to them a few years back. We just need to come up here more often. Come here. Yeah, that's pretty good. Oh, shh! What? What? Shh! Liam. He's down the hall. You can hear everything in this house. I gave him elephant tranquilizers. He's not going to hear anything. The pediatric dose? Yes, okay. Yes. Everything's gonna be all right. I promise. Cory? Cory. Cory, There's something in the hall. Were you dreaming? I was wide awake. Well, I don't know.

They took the phones! Let's go! Check the landline! What happened to Liam? Oh, god! Cory? It's dead! What are we gonna do? I don't know. We have to get help! Keep going. Okay. There's enough furniture in here to barricade the door. And these windows are high enough, no one's gonna be able to climb in. What are you talking about? You stay in here. You don't make a sound. You don't open the door for anybody but me. Where are you going? To see if I can get help. I'm coming with you! No, no, listen to me, all right? I need to run, and your foot is hurt. Stay here. Take this. Barricade the door. Come here. Barricade the door. Action figure: The enemy is in my sight. Kill confirmed. The enemy is in my sight. Liam? Kill confirmed. The enemy is in my sight. Kill confirmed. The enemy is in my sight. Kill confirmed. Liam? The enemy is in my sight. Liam? No! No! Shit! No. No! Who are you people? Where's my son? Woman: round and round we go, and as we... Oh, my god! Where's my son?! Jesus! Is he... is he your father? Did he do this to you? You don't have to let him do this. I can help you. Please, no. No, wait! Wait! What do you want from me? For you to be honest. If anything's happened to my son, So help me god, I will kill every last one of you! That's funny. Help you, god? There's no help. If you've touched one hair on his head, I... Your son is already dead, And it's all your fault. No. No! No. Liam! Liam! Start! We want you to be honest. About what? You wanted this. No, I didn't. You wanted your son dead. That's why you killed him. You're... you're gonna pay. For destroying my family. Funny again. You're going to pay. For destroying your family. For the father, Until he's honest. start. Start. Please start. What do you want? Why do you want him? Take him home. This is his home! This is his hell. Why don't you take off the mask? I know honesty. If you didn't have a child, He wouldn't have been taken. If he wasn't taken, You wouldn't be searching for him. If you weren't searching for him, You wouldn't be going through this right now. Tell me that thought never crossed your mind. Honestly. As I thought. Dad? Liam. Don't you touch him! You leave him alone. You leave him alone! Dad, what's happening? Dad?! Nothing. It's okay. It's okay, Liam. No! It's not. You-You said he was dead. He was, Every day he spent with you. Hating him for putting you here. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Be honest with him. Tell him you don't love him. No. Honesty saves. Make him believe it, or he dies. No. As you wish. Liam? Dad, what's going on? Dad, they said you had something to say. I want to go home! Dad... I don't... I don't like you. What?

Come on, we've got to go. We've got to go right now. Come on. Look, they made me say those things to you. They tortured me. They made me lie to you. Do you remember when we went walking in the forest with mommy? We got lost, but mommy said. That nighttime in the forest is the safest time. Because the bears go back to their cubs, the deer to their doe. Nighttime in the forest is a time for returning to your family. Remember? You've got to believe me. Tell me that you believe me. Good. We've got to get out of here, all right, boss? Come on. She said this was my new home. Who said that? Our little brother is home. Our little brother deserves better than you. He deserves the father.

Yeah, he's good. Okay, big guy. Come on, let's get you out of here. What's this? In case you get cold. We're still sweeping the area. Last body? We'll probably fish it out downstream. Did find this, though. Psych ward at the hospital's about to get busy. They say it's going to be weeks before he says a word. What about her? There's an army. Of child service personnel waiting to talk to her. And find out what happened here. Let the hospital deal with this bullshit. So, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say. You probably haven't had a burger and fries in awhile. What do you say we pick one up on the way, my treat? Okay. That's why god invented the radio. Son of a bitch. Yeah, this is... I knew you'd come for me. They hurt our family. We've got each other. Families are forever. Now we must find anew mother. What about the father? The father will be coming.
