inhabitants of this underground city. 155 00:20:23,228 -- 00:20:25,587 The city is surrounded by grassland. 156 00:20:26,508 -- 00:20:29,708 Unfortunately its citizens, grass-cutter ants, 157 00:20:29,869 -- 00:20:32,429 can't actually eat grass. 158 00:20:41,832 -- 00:20:43,550 (crunching) 159 00:20:51,474 -- 00:20:56,154 (thumping) 160 00:21:01,836 -- 00:21:03,556 (upbeat music) 161 00:21:09,477 -- 00:21:12,637 Yet they collect every blade of grass they can, 162 00:21:13,159 -- 00:21:15,918 and they carry it all the way back to the colony. 163 00:21:37,244 -- 00:21:39,644 (upbeat

00:22:44,498 They chop it up and feed it to a fungus that can eat grass. 172 00:22:46,859 -- 00:22:48,858 And then they eat the fungus. 173 00:22:57,061 -- 00:23:00,501 The anthill is a massive underground farm. 174 00:23:08,384 -- 00:23:10,103 lt's a perfect arrangement, 175 00:23:10,704 -- 00:23:13,704 except that the fungus produces so much carbon dioxide 176 00:23:13,865 -- 00:23:15,904 it poisons the air down here. 177 00:23:18,386 -- 00:23:20,305 The ants have sorted that problem, too. 178 00:23:22,987 -- 00:23:27,107 They've built specially designed ventilation shafts to keep their air clean. 179 00:23:28,708 -- 00:23:31,747 They're farmers, architects and engineers. 180 00:23:37,590 -- 00:23:40,830 Each individual ant has a brain the size of a pinhead. 181 00:23:42,631 -- 00:23:44,591 but somehow, together, 182 00:23:44,751 -- 00:23:47,591 they have invented a solution to feeding themselves 183 00:23:47,753 -- 00:23:49,672 that we would be proud to match. 184 00:23:57,994 -- 00:24:01,034 Sometimes in life, the best way is to follow your own path. 185 00:24:01,955 -- 00:24:04,835 Choose food that no one else has a taste for. 186 00:24:23,280 -- 00:24:24,599
