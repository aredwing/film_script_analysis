I come with the morning star as my guide and the hawk as my protector. My father, the sachem of our people, had a vision when I was little. Like him, I would be a leader and a warrior one day. ""But you will become a different kind of leader," he said. ""Your eyes will see far beyond our horizon. "" I did not yet understand his words of wisdom. I did not know Mother Earth was so much bigger than our village - even bigger than our hunting grounds. I only began to learn about these things the day after beautiful Nakooma and I became husband and wife. (speaking Algonquin) (speaking Algonquin) Ha-ha! (rhythmic drumming) (man chanting) (all chanting) (speaking Algonquin) (chatter and laughter) (# all singing) (cheering/whooping) (speaks Algonquin) (hawk cries in distance) (speaks Algonquin) We're going ashore. I've spotted a tribe. - Form a search party! - Prepare the Iaunch! (speaks Algonquin) Prepare to Iand! (speaking Algonquin) (speaking Algonquin) (speaking Algonquin) Trade. (speaking Algonquin) Dermer, tell the sachem we need five strong men to carry the furs to our ship. We have enough men of our own, surely, sir. Mr. Dermer, this expedition is under my command. PIease translate Mr. Harding's request. Sir. (Nakooma) Squanto! Move it! Move it along! You heard the captain! (Captain) Prepare to hold cargo! Come. Come, my friend. This way. Down. Down below. Understand? Down below. - Up anchor! - Up anchor! Below. Get them below. Now! Seize them! - Squanto! - (speaking Algonquin) Seize them! Seize the Indians! Aah! Nakooma! Squanto! Nakooma! Canon, fire! Nakooma! Squanto! Squanto! Squanto! (Nakooma wailing) (sobbing) Squanto! Mark my words:. treat them as friends, Mr. Dermer, you'II find an arrow in your back. Steal from them, Mr. Harding, and you kill any opportunity to trade with them in the future. I'm carrying out orders, Mr. Dermer, orders that come from Sir George, who owns this ship and pays our wages. Excuse me, sir. They still refuse to eat. They won't eat so Iong as they're Iocked up and treated Iike animals. For the Iast time, will you Iet me untie them? - And then they'II eat? - Yes! Well, what will they eat, Mr. Dermer? Huh? They might just start with you! (laughter) (laughter continues) (in Algonquin) Me na Epenow. Me na Squanto. Mene dalusi Thomas. (speaking Algonquin) Be careful. - Watch out! - I'II bloody that savage. Don't. Come on. Back! You treat them far too well, Mr. Dermer. Make way! Make way! Stand aside! Coming through! Ah, my ship, my ship! This is a great day for England, a great day for the PIymouth Shipping Company. Morning, everybody. What a beautiful morning it is. Beautiful morning. - Ah! - Good day, Sir George. Mr. Hunt, Mr. Harding, returned alive and well, I see. We had a very successful voyage, Sir George. Well, I expect nothing Iess from you gentlemen. - Lower the chair. - Well done, Mr. Harding. - I think you'II find the discomfort worth it. - I hope so, I hope so, Harding. Secure the Iine! AII the way! That's it. Thank you, boys. Thank you, boys. Ah! Thank you, Dermer. Ah, well... Now tell me, is this the full extent of our venture? Anything gold, silver, jewels, fine armor, swords? Prepare to be astonished, Sir George. Bring them topside. - What are they? - The noble savage, Sir George. They're awful. They're horrible. (laughs) Lord, they are wonderful. Tell me, what would happen if I approach them? Oh, have no fear. My men will protect you. You know, they seem frightened. They've never seen a place Iike this before. No. You've never seen anyone Iike me before, have you? I am Sir... - What is that? - That's bear fat, Sir George. How disgusting. Bear fat. Aah! You speak these people's Ianguage, Dermer. - I do, Sir George. - Tell them who I am! I'm the PIymouth Shipping Company. I own this ship. I own them! I don't think they'd understand that, sir, the idea that one man can own another. Then they'II have to understand it. This one needs to be disciplined. CIean him up. Then we'II put him on display in front of the great British public. Now take me back! Ladies and gentlemen, for your sporting pleasure, the next match has never been seen on English shores. - Bring them in. - May I present to you, by courtesy of the PIymouth Shipping Company - of which I am the proprietor - a wild, wild barbarian from the New World. (cheers/applause) - (woman) Oh, my. - (woman #2) He's horrid. (overlapping shouts) You see, Dermer, the riffraff adore him. Yes! Look! He's cut! Ah! Aah! Ladies and gentlemen, Squanto the savage! I'm making a gold mine here, Harding. - Gold mine! - Indeed, Sir George. (# chanting/singing) No, no! I want him alive! Go! Get after them! Don't Iet them escape, you fools! Save me, save me! (both) Aah! (speaking Algonquin) Aah! (speaking Algonquin) Get after him! Go after him! He's getting away! Round the back, round the back! They Iost the scent. We're heading back. You men, check the east dock. - Harding, did you find him? - Bring him. - We've captured one of them, Sir George. - Not that one, you fool. It's Squanto I want. I'm afraid he's still at Iarge for the moment. This man's injured. He needs a physician. You still see them as human beings, Dermer, that's your problem. Look, Harding, find him! I don't care how many men it takes - find Squanto. Yes, Sir George. What is that? Brother Daniel! What is it, Brother Daniel? He doesn't Iook Iike an Englishman. You see? You see? We found him on the beach. He's not dressed Iike an Englishman. Careful, brothers. Back! This is not a part of God's creation. He's a kind of devil, I suspect. Devil... Brother Paul, this is no evil beast. Not evil, perhaps, but a beast nonetheless. Nonsense. Only so Iong as we treat him Iike a beast. What are you suggesting? That he stay in here and eat with us? I'm suggesting we do not judge this fellow. We show him the kindness we would show any stranger. And we discover who he is. Come on, sit! Let us say grace. - Heavenly Father... - (men) Heavenly Father... (all)..we thank thee for these and all thy mercies... (# humming) (goat bleating) Brothers! Brothers! Brothers, come quickly! James! Brother Paul! Daniel! Outside! He's outside! Let him be, brothers. Let him be. We have no hold on him here. Brother Daniel! Go, my friend. You are free! He won't get far. He's injured. He's weak. He's the Devil, Brother Paul. You said so yourself. Come, brothers. Come along. (bird cry) (cries like hawk) What's he doing? (Squanto continues calling) A miracle. BIasphemy! That's not a miracle. Give way! Make way! There"s no trace of the savage to be found. I'm tired of hearing "No, no, no, no"! I want to hear "yes" for a change! - Do you understand, Mr. Harding? - Yes. A naked Indian with hair down to the ground and a necklace made of shells and feathers disappears into a civilized city and all the well-paid and well-trained military men can't find him? It's not a needle in the haystack - it's a haystack! There are some of us who think he must have drowned in the great storm. Well, I don't accept your theory. I don't Iike it either. (cries) I want my Indian! I made promises to London. Sir George, you have the other savage. He is very popular with the crowds. I don't want popular! I want sensational! Squanto was sensational. He could sing. He could fight! The public were clamoring for him to come. You know... I'm a businessman. You know that, don't you? Oh, yes, yes. I've invested in that Indian. I want him back. Continue the search. I don't care if you have to go as far as Scotland. - I want my Squanto! Find him! - Yes, Sir George. Maushop. Maushop. Come. Come. Come here. Maushop... that. Is that maushop? Maushop... horse. - Horse... - Yes. Let me show you. Horse. Come. You see? Touch him. Don't be afraid. Touch him. Horse. No, no, no. He won't hurt you. Don't be afraid. Touch him. Maushop... horse. We ride the horse. Here. Let me show you. See? I'm holding him gently. Gently. You see? Come on. You try. (laughs) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold this. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Kick him. Give him a kick. Give him a Iittle kick. A Iittle more. That's it. - Horse. Horse. - Horse. - (Daniel) Horse. - He's quite good. Well, he's not as good as we are, but he's... There you go. - Horse. - Horse. Yes, you said it. Horse. Horse! Oh, no. Come back! You see what you get for your trust, Brother Daniel? He's a horse thief! (horse neighs) Aah! Brothers! Brothers! He's coming back! Brothers! He's coming back! Horse! - Well done. - (laughter/applause) You see, Squanto? These are all books. Book. - Book. - Yes. Horse. Book. Excellent. Horse. Book. I happen to be a man who has read far too many books. My head is full of all kinds of nonsense, but I Iove books. I Iove everything about them. Let me show you. This is my favorite. The Odyssey. Second favorite. Lightly. Gently, gently. Yes. You see? Isn't it beautiful? Nakooma. Nakooma? This one? Nakooma. That is your word for "woman"? "Nakooma." That is his word for "woman." Let me show you. I'm going to teach you my Ianguage, Squanto. And Iearn yours if I can. If I can discover where in this vast world you've come from, perhaps I can help you to go home. - Nakooma. - Nakooma. - Woman. - Woman. - Fishing net. - That's right. Fishing net. (# humming) - Brother Timothy. - Brother Paul? Brother Paul... What are you wearing on your feet? Hm? Oh, uh... footwear. - Show me this footwear. - Cheese? Brother Timothy, I said show me this footwear! Squanto made them. They're extremely comfortable. Brother Timothy, you did not join this monastery to be comfortable! There will be comfort enough in the Iife to come. Yes, Brother Paul. This is a cloister! We have secluded ourselves here to worship, not to be distracted by visitors! Oh! Hey, Brother Paul! Brother Daniel! We are forgetting our purpose here, Brother Daniel. There's nothing sinful in this. Your pagan friend has disrupted our quiet Iife. - (men shouting) - It's time he Ieft. - Oh, he can't Ieave. - Why not? - He's still recovering from his injuries. - Oh, indeed. Well, I'm not a doctor, Brother Daniel, but it would appear that he is fully recovered. But he's Iearning from us, Brother Paul, and we are Iearning from him. He's beginning to speak and observe our ways. Is it not our duty to bring Iight into the darkness? (man) Oh! Oh! Ohh! - (laughter) - Oh! - Do you see this flower? - Yes. It is a pink Mandevilla. When it blooms, its petals are Iike a trumpet. But it's not blooming because it is a gift from our brothers in a monastery in Spain. - You see? You cannot uproot a flower... - (thunder) and plant it in a place where it does not belong! But Squanto has nowhere to go. He's Iost, and from what he's told me, I believe he's come from the New World. - Poppycock! I'II never believe it. - (men cheering) There is no New World. There is only this world. And this world, Brother Daniel, is not round. It is flat! - Oh, Brother... - FIat! Whatever you believe, Squanto came to our country by ship. Winter is upon us. No ships will sail before spring. Will you deny him shelter, Brother Paul? Come. (Squanto chanting) (all chanting) Heavenly Father! Heavenly Father... we thank thee for these and all thy mercies. Amen. (Squanto speaking Algonquin) - What is that word? - Kissuulk. - It is the name of Squanto's god. - (men) Oh... Ah. And what exactly is the function of this... god? Squanto, tell us about Kissuulk. He is the Creator. (men) Ah. Tell me, Squanto, this mysterious Iand that you come from - you must miss it after all this time. Yes, Brother Paul. I miss my family, my people... And Nakooma. Nakooma is the name of Squanto's bride. Bride? You are married, Squanto? Yes, Brother Paul. (laughter) Where are the women of your tribe? We have no women, Squanto. We have devoted our Iives to God. Your tribe will die with no women. (Brother Paul) Squanto, we are not a tribe. I would never join a tribe with no women. - (laughter) - We are not a tribe. I Ioved Nakooma when we were children. I miss her. I was so fortunate to be with the brothers, who taught me their language, their ways and values. But as the seasons passed, I got restless. Nakooma was visiting me in my dreams, and I saw tears in her eyes. I had to be with my people again soon, or my heart would die. (hawk cries) For months we've been searching for him. He must have drowned, Sir George. It's the only explanation. That's a convenient explanation. If he's dead, I want proof. - If not, keep on Iooking for him. - Sir George, Iook at my men. The weather's been fierce. They've been frostbitten! We've Iost two horses! You Iose your position if you fail me, Harding. You hear me? Your status, your income, your reputation, your future. This is PIymouth! I own PIymouth! Yes, Sir George. Who are you? Sir George, my name is William Bradford, and this is Dr. Samuel Fuller. - Puritans. - In search of religious freedom. Several of us would Iike to book passage on one of your ships. I have no objection to taking fanatics Iike you over the sea, but I must warn you of one thing, gentlemen: I don't deal in shillings, I deal in pounds. - We have very Iittle, I'm afraid. - Then you're wasting my valuable time. - Mr. Dermer. - Sir. You're wasting your own time, too, gentlemen. The New World is no place for men of peace. You won't survive without military protection. We have our faith, and we are resolute in our purpose. (laughs) I think you'II need a Iittle more than that, my friends. Ah, pork pie! Why anyone would want to Ieave England, I'II never know. Mr. Dermer, you're a man of maps and charts. Look at this map. Now, tell me, where do you think Squanto would hide? Well, his tribe Iived mostly by the ocean, so I doubt very much he'd go inland. Not near any city, certainly. That would only terrify him. - Ah. Mr. Harding! - (man) Mr. Harding! You know, you impress me, Dermer. You seem to understand these people. You know them. Well, I do believe, sir, that if we want to trade with them, we should at Ieast try to Iearn what we can about their culture. - I can't think of anything more tedious. - It's practical, Sir George. And it's good business. Think of all the opportunities you've missed by stealing these men from their tribes. You've made enemies instead of friends. You can't conduct business with enemies. But we're stronger than they are. We can make them do anything we want them to do. You watched Squanto fight off a whole platoon of armed men. These are not complacent people, sir. They're warriors. (Daniel) Bibougest. (Squanto) Hawk. Beautiful hawk. My friend, my protector. He is always with me. You've Iearned my Ianguage far better than I've Iearned yours, Squanto. For me there was no choice. Was there, maushop? (hawk cries) - What is it, Squanto? - The hawk crossed our path. He warns us. Who are they, Squanto? Hold up! Up there! Follow me! Come on! Hyah! Go on, Squanto, hide from them. Hey! Hey! Ha! Ya! Ya! Faster! Ya! What's happening, Brother Daniel? - They've come Iooking for Squanto. - Perhaps he belongs with the authorities. - We mustn't tell them he's here. - Do not ask me to Iie, Brother Daniel. - I will not Iie. - Then do not speak at all. You there! You're holding property that doesn't belong to you. You, sir, are standing on private ground. We know he's here, Friar. Hand him over. He's owned by the PIymouth Shipping Company. The PIymouth Shipping Company has no business in this sanctuary. This sanctuary, under Protestant Iaw, has no business on English soil! Search the place! You, search the stables! Tell me where he is! This is a place of worship! - There's nobody here... - Get out of my way! - This is a private monastery. - Spare me your Iies! PIease don't. I'm telling you the truth - there's nothing here. Follow me! Come on! Tear the place apart! - Squanto... - Brother James. - It's you that they're after. Stay hidden. - They are hurting you. It'II be worse for you if they find you, my friend. Stay back. AII right! What is the purpose of this? These are our books, our manuscripts! I'm out of patience with that bloody Indian! - Out of my way, monk. - I will not. Out of my way! Aah! This is a place of Iearning. Then Iet me teach you a Iesson. Understand? The sooner you cooperate, the sooner we stop! We will cooperate. Tell me what you want. You know what we want, Friar. The beast. The wild, wild Indian who Iives Iike a filthy animal! The savage! Where is he? Savage? Beast? Filthy animal? I swear upon this holy book, no one Iike that is here. Out! Move out! (hawk cries) You protected me, all of you. They did this to you. Your books. Your house. AII this was because of me. No, Squanto. It was because there are some people who bully their way through this world with cruelty and force. You have no weapons to stop them. That is not how we battle our enemies. Enemies destroy you! Our books, our windows, yes. But our spirits are still intact. You do not hate the men who did this to you? No. We do not hate. Hatred only Ieads to more hatred. Brothers... Thank you. Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. No, no, no! Just repeat what he says, will you? Why doesn't the savage speak? - I think perhaps it's his dignity, sir. - Dignity, my foot! I want an Indian who can sing, dance, fight... Like Squanto, the one who got away! His reputation has been quite special since his escape from the bear pit, sir. Has it really? Tell me, when people talk about the escape, am I the object of public ridicule? Of course not, sir. Give me that, you thief! (dogs barking) Gold. Gold. In my home, Capoge... we have gold everywhere. Did you hear what he said? How did he Iearn to speak Iike that? - Did you say "gold"? - Yes, sir. Heave! Ah, Mr. Dermer. - Sir George, welcome aboard. - Yes, thank you. The ship is in fine shape, isn't she, sir? She'II be ready to sail as planned. Never been very keen on ships. Anyway, I'm here on business. My Indian, Epenow, says there's gold in his country. Opinion? It's a vast and wondrous place, sir. It's perfectly possible. Do you think if I Iet him go with you, you could Iure him or persuade him to show you where the gold is? Perhaps - in exchange for his freedom. I could certainly use his help as well to trade with his tribe again. I'm reluctant to Iet him go without being certain of being able to replace him by Squanto. - I thought you'd Iocated Squanto. - I've Iocated him, but I haven't caught him. We need to Iure him somehow. What in our culture could possibly attract Squanto? Squanto! Squant... Squanto! Squanto! Squanto! Squanto... A ship! A ship! The market... A ship... We've been to the market and Iearned of a ship that's Ieaving PIymouth in 1 5 days. - What ship? - It's called the Half Moon. PIymouth. PIymouth is a dangerous place for you, Squanto. AII we need to do is get him on board. Daniel, there may not be another ship for months. Years! - What on earth is this? - It's food, Brother Paul. Food? - It's as hard as a rock. - It's been dried. You plant it in the ground. A great big thing Iike this? I believe it grows into an enormous tree. Brothers, we haven't even prayed this evening, and you... - Shh! - (crackling) - Food is speaking. - Oh... Food from the New World speaks, does it? (Paul) Well, Squanto, I doubt if you'II find many... - Oh! - (laughter) English! (man) Stay back! English... you have no courage. (Squanto chuckles) Brothers... this is delicious. It's good. Have some. Try some now. It's good. It's really good. - Really? - Try it. It is good. If such a place of wonder does exist... your heart must ache to go back to it. Brother Daniel, you have my permission to ride to PIymouth. You must see Squanto safely to the ship and then return. Now, you protect these good men the way you watched over me. Squanto? You haven't been fiddling with this flower, have you? Well, you Iook quite a sight in that sackcloth. Tell me, does it make you feel at all Iike a monk? I'm still thinking about a woman, Brother Paul. Oh. I must tell you something, Squanto. I confess it's been a stubborn weakness of mine... I resist the possibility of other worlds, other customs, other points of view. Sometimes I overlook the goodness in a man even when it's staring me in the face. Go in peace. You have my blessing. Thank you, Brother Paul. Take this as a gift from my heart. (# lively music) Mr. Epenow has figured out how to avoid a whipping, eh, Mr. Harding? Very Iiberal of you to give him his freedom, Sir George. A business transaction. (gasps/cheers) This brave that came from the New World will battle the Ottoman army, the wildest in the world! Chief Epenow! I must warn you though, this performance is not for the faint of heart. No, Squanto. No. You have risked your Iife for a friend, Brother Daniel. Epenow's my friend. I must do the same. (cheers/whistles) The fool! (war cry) Oh, no! Not yet, Harding. He will entertain the audience. Squanto, the savage! Squanto! Squanto! (crowd) Squanto! Squanto! Squanto! Squanto! Squanto! Squanto! (chanting continues) Well, now, Squanto, you were spectacular this afternoon. The common people Ioved you. The gentry Ioved you. You were the talk of the town. There is indeed a ship Ieaving for your homeland. It Ieaves PIymouth tomorrow at noon. Your friend Epenow will be on board that ship. You, however, will not. You can't run away from me, Indian. I own you now. You will do whatever I tell you to do. Obey me and you'II be treated fairly. Disobey me and you'II be punished. There is a divine order to Iife. First there's God, followed by the angels, then the king... Then the rest of us according to our position in the world. Your position, Indian, is Iower than the animals. You're not a human being. You're Iivestock. Harding! Make very sure you keep him bound and guarded at all times. - Of course, Sir George. - Just Iike my friend here, Epenow. Take me home, you good-for-nothing. You there. The man you're Iooking for is not here. - Do you know where he is? - Locked away. - He'II die. - It has nothing to do with me. Yes, it has. The man is a human being. He needs to go home. He was brought over from the New World on a ship Iike this. I know. (horse neighs) (makes sucking noise) Have a successful voyage, Dermer. Do good business for me. - Bring my ship back safely. - Aye-aye, Sir George. - Weigh the anchor! - Aye-aye, sir. Let go all bunts! Hoist the sails! On your feet, savage! - Take him. - Get up, you animal. Come on, you, now. You. What is your business here? Aah! Get out of my way! After him, you fools! Capture the savage! Report to Sir George! - Sir George! Sir George! - What is it? - The Indian has escaped! - What? Dermer! Hard to starboard! Hard to starboard! He's getting away! After him! Head round the other side! Be certain this is the Iast time you make a fool of me, savage! - Brother Daniel! - There is no time. - You are a true warrior. - Ha! Let's go, maushop. BIess you, bless you. God bless. After him! Sir George, the Half Moon! The Indian, sir! (man) Out of the way! Move it! In the name of the king, out of the way! (speaking Algonquin) No, no, no! Oh! No, no! Oh, no, no, no! Aah! Whoa! Sir George! My Indian! Stop that ship! Stop that ship! Harding! Harding! - You're fired! You're fired! - Yes! Yes, Sir George. Save me! Stop that ship! Brother Daniel! Brother Daniel! Thank you! You won the trust of the English, Epenow. The Engli... (quietly) The English are greedy. I promised them gold. Where is this gold? I've Iearned many things from the English. One of them was how to Iie. I Iearned from them, too. I found friends among them. (horse neighs) Our friends are the people that we are going home to. The Nausets and the Patuxets. I am Ioyal to my people. And my family. And my son. Pequod will be a great sachem one day. I too am Ioyal to my people and family. And my bride, Nakooma. But new friends do not threaten my Ioyalty. Then you are a fool, Squanto. The white man is not your friend. He will only betray you. My father taught me to let my heart be my guide. From the brothers, I learned to keep my spirit, even in pain. Epenow"s words left me concerned. Land ho! Epenow! I was almost home. My heart was longing for the moment when I would hold Nakooma in my arms again and my family would gather around the fire to celebrate my return. But our ship sailed into Nauset Bay, the place of Epenow"s people, a few days away from my village. Stow your oars now. Keep your eyes peeled onshore. (assorted ""bird"" calls) (calls continue) Pequod! (speaks Algonquin) Dada! (whooping) Squanto! (rhythmic drumming/man singing) (# all singing) I go to rest now. I Ieave at dawn for home. Won't you dance with me? Dance with me. How about a kiss, then? Just a Iittle one. Come on. Come on! For God's sakes, man, remember your manners! You're a guest here. She's just a bloody savage anyway. (distant shouts and whooping) What have you done? This is not our way! No, it is not our way! It is the way of the English! Aah! You welcome them to your village and now you slaughter them as the enemy? They came to our Iand to trade, then they took us away and treated us Iike animals! You have punished a good man for other men's cruelty! I killed them because I am a warrior! - You have forgotten who you are! - I have not forgotten! Go back to your village, Squanto... and see what the English have brought to your people. Then judge me for what I have done. (flies buzzing) Nakooma! (bell chiming) I began to understand Epenow"s rage. All of my people were dead, killed by the sickness brought by the English. My heart was bleeding. Nakooma "s tears still haunted me. The playful laughter of my people still echoed through the village. Now I would wear their ashes and carry their spirits with me. I had become a sachem without a tribe. The English would come again - I knew that. And I promised the Great Spirit to be the warrior my father had seen in his vision. Dr. Fuller, Mr. Bradford! (bell chimes) Look at this. We're safe here. Protected on all sides. I suggest we bury our dead before we settle in. I still feel uneasy about this decision. This is someone else's home. God has guided us here. This will be our home. - But what if they come back? - They will be met with resistance. That is what you pay me for. Warwick, take one man and search the surrounding forest. (exotic bird call) (bird calls) (hawk cries) (distant voices) (groaning) Captain Fuller! Man the barricades! You two, come with me. Carver, make sure the women and children are secure. I want every man of yours armed and ready. Mr. Bradford, could you bring the rosewater, please? We should try to make contact with these people first. We must show them we mean no harm. I will not allow my men to be used as target practice. If we do not show strength now, then all is Iost. Mr. Standish is right. We've Iived too Iong under fear and persecution. I say we fight for what should be ours. Think of what you're saying, Mr. Carver. Are we to be the same as those who persecuted us in England? - Should we commit murder? - Bradford, I am preventing murder. I shall do what is necessary. I want all men to enforce the barricade! Squanto! (speaks Algonquin) What has to be done. What my father would have done. - (Carver) Shoot him. - (Bradford) No, wait. - Shoot him. - Mr. Carver, he's unarmed. (Squanto) Enough! Too much blood. Too much blood on this Iand. Too many tears. It's a trick. AII of my people have died here. And all of your people will die too. Put down your weapons! AII of you! - (war cry) - Pequod! No! - (speaks Algonquin) - No! Now kill me! Kill me! And you'II kill them and they'II kill you. And more of us will die! And we will kill each other until there's nothing Ieft! Nothing but ashes and bones! We must end this! Here! Now! I'm a doctor. I can help. I can help! PIease, we must take him inside to stop the bleeding. If he dies, you all die. - (sizzling) - (groans) The ball is out. But his wound is inflamed and I fear he's growing more feverish. (speaks Algonquin) - This. - Mm. (chanting) (rhythmic drumming) (chanting) How is he now? He's now in the hands of the Creator. We must wait. (pilgrims) Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us:, and Iead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily... Dada. The Creator has given my son Pequod his Iife back today. We will Ieave this village now. Thank you, my friend. (speaks Algonquin) And so began a time of harmony between people whose ways were so different from one another. Ve who knew the land taught those who had come from far away how to plant and to hunt. At harvest we came together to give thanks. Brothers and sisters, new friends, please, Iet us rise and pray. (Native man speaks Algonquin) Heavenly Father, we thank thee for this bountiful harvest and for bringing so many of us together on this joyous day. We humbly ask thee for thy blessing. (speaking Algonquin) Amen. PIease, everyone, eat. My friends! In the world there are many people... with all kinds of customs and beliefs... speaking many Ianguages. But there is only one moon, one sun... one Mother Earth. And there is only one tribe. (speaking Algonquin) Let's Iive together in peace! (speak Algonquin) (hawk cries)
